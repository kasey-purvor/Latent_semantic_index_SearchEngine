Green et al.\nBy focusing on user profiles and design patterns we will argue that accessible (and\nusable) learning objects can be achieved by designing for adaptability. This is a\ndeparture from the well-documented and frequently proposed approach to design-\ning for accessibility: that of universal design (sometimes called design for all). It\ndoes, however, reflect current developments. For example, The IMS (2004)\n\u2018AccessForAll\u2019 specification currently proposes an adaptability model for digital\nresources and services, which attempts to match resources and services to users\u2019\nneeds and preferences. Although the motivation of the \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 specification\nis primarily to ensure the accessibility of resources, it also, almost as a by-product,\nensures that resources are more usable and better designed. The new proposals\nmove away from the view that web resources can be sensibly designed to meet the\nneeds of everyone through strict adherence to standards and universal design princi-\nples. There is a new recognition that addressing all issues of accessibility, multicul-\nturalism and language in a single standard could never be realised: one group or\nother would inevitably be excluded. However, we argue that the idea that resources\nshould be adaptable (and adapted) to the needs of individuals or groups is\neminently sensible.\nIn exploring issues of accessibility, adaptability and learning objects, the term\n\u2018accessibility\u2019 is used to mean availability to a wide audience including those with\nspecific needs; \u2018adaptability\u2019 is used in the context of the ease with which a digital\nresource can be modified to meet different user requirements, and the terms \u2018learning\npatterns\u2019, \u2018learning objects\u2019, \u2018resources\u2019 and \u2018components\u2019 represent a loose hierarchy\nof reusable elements that together form a learning solution.\nMetadata and profiles of needs and preferences\nDublin Core metadata\nDublin Core (DC) in its simplest form is an interoperability standard for catalogue\ninformation on digital resources. Books, journal articles, webpages, videos, digital\nimages, learning objects or information relating to almost anything anyone might\nwish to reference could be considered a digital resource. The Dublin Core Metadata\nInitiative1 proposes an abstract model consisting of a description made up of one or\nmore statement about a single resource and optionally the unique resource indicator\nof the resource being described. Each statement is made up of a property and a value\n(or value unique resource indicator). One advantage of DC over other standards is\nthat it is relatively simple, consisting of only 15 core properties, and consequently\nforms the basis of many other standards particularly for archives or digital repositories\n(e.g. the Open Archive Initiative [2004] metadata harvesting standard). Additionally,\nthe core properties or elements are fairly obvious things such as title, subject, date,\ncreator, contributor, and so on.\nDC statements can be encoded directly within the object or resource itself typically\nif it is an XHTML document. More commonly a separate catalogue is held to contain\nthe DC metadata elements and reference information. Essentially, the DC elements\nAccessibility and adaptability of learning objects 119\ntypically form a separate database often referred to as a resource catalogue. In the case\nof the \u2018Java Project\u2019, learning object references and metadata are held in a learning\nresource catalogue (LRC3).\nAccessibility profiles\nAs well as knowing what resources they are dealing with and their properties,\nresource creators may also be interested in characterising users so they can match\navailable resources to them. This is often referred to as user profiling. User profile\ninformation can be used for accessibility purposes, but in many instances context or\npreference may be equally important. For example, a car driver needing access to\nweb or PDA information may be in a similar position to a blind user in that neither\ncan handle primarily visual material but could probably usefully access audible\ndescriptions or instructions. Consequently it may be possible to identify this profile\nas a non-visual or auditory profile. Equally, other contexts may require large text\n(e.g. visual presentations to large audiences or to someone with a visual impair-\nment). A non-auditory profile might mean that audio material needs a transcription\nand video needs captions or subtitles. In broad terms there is a need to be able to\ndefine a user\u2019s contextual profile as a set of requirements for services and resources.\nTypically the profile will define the user\u2019s human\u2013computer interaction require-\nments in terms of visual, auditory and tactile components. The three main elements\nof the profile will be: \n1. Display or output (typically visual but could be an auditory screen reader or\ntactile Braille display).\n2. Control or input (typically keyboard and mouse but could be switches, touch-\nscreen, joystick tactile devices or an auditory voice recognition system).\n3. Content (primarily visual, auditory media or textual components that can be read\nor transformed into auditory components by a screen reader).\nIn the IMS \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 proposal (IMS, 2004; Nevile, 2005), an \u2018adaptability\u2019\nelement is employed to identify a set of user needs and preferences. This is considered\nan important enough extension by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative to consider\nincorporation into the DC standards itself.\nProfiles of needs and preferences\nThe IMS \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 initiative also proposes an anonymous profile of needs and\npreference (PNP). The profile is anonymous in that there is no need to know who the\nuser is or why they require the specified support. Also, choices and options are\nconsidered just as important as absolute needs; for example, a user might express a\npreference for Braille output, but with an indicator that auditory substitution is also\nacceptable but visual elements are unacceptable. Another profile might express the\nneed for large text or a screen reader. In essence this is encoded using a predeter-\nmined structure and vocabulary (see Figure 1).\n120 S. Green et al.\nFigure 1. IMS \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 PNP vocabularyThe proposed structure and vocabulary encourages the designer to check and build\nfor adaptability. For example: Is the display fully accessible to a screen reader? Is\nmouse emulation or alternative pointing catered for? Does the content cater for\npersonal style sheets? These factors and more can be coded into the adaptability\nelement using the items identified in Figure 1.\nThe important point is that, in principle, if digital resources are associated with\nrich metadata and a detailed profile of needs and preferences are available, there\nexists the necessary pre-requisites for designing and developing accessible applica-\ntions through adaptable resources. Before considering in detail the process\napplied, the following section takes a closer look at the application area under\nconsideration.\nscreenReader\nscreenEnhance\ntextReadingHighlight\nbraille\ntactile\nvisualAlert\ndisplay\nstructuralPresentation\nkeyboardEnhance\nonscreenKeyboard\nalternativeKeyboards\nmouseEmulation\nalternativePointing\nvoiceRecognition\nstructuralNavigation\ncontrol\ncodeinput\nalternativesToVisual\nalternativesToText\nvisualText\nalternativesToAuditory\nlearnerScaffold\npersonalStyleSheet\ncontent\nextraTime\nFigure 1. IMS \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 PNP vocabulary\nAccessibility and adaptability of learning objects 121\nLearning objects and metadata\nCriteria for reusing learning objects\nThe arguments in favour of the reuse of learning resources include economic ones\n(Downes, 2001) and those of quality (Jones, 2004). However, in order for learning\nresources to be effectively reused they should be designed with reuse in mind: they\nshould be cohesive and decoupled from other resources (Boyle, 2003). In other\nwords, a reusable learning object should be concerned with a single topic (i.e.\ncohesive) and not be unnecessarily linked to (i.e. decoupled from) external resources;\nthus, a learning object should be \u2018an independent and self-standing unit of learning\ncontent\u2019 (Polsani, 2003, section 2.2).\nIn order to be as widely reusable as possible, learning objects should also be context\nfree. However, freedom from a particular learning context may reduce their pedagog-\nical effectiveness; therefore reusable learning objects, while being free from any\nparticular context that would restrict their reuse, should still be adaptable to the\nspecific context in which they may be used (Jones, 2004).\nPatterns\nExpert practitioners use their experience of solving problems in the past to build on\nand create new solutions in new situations. \nOne thing expert designers know not to do is to solve every problem from first principles.\nRather, they reuse solutions that have worked for them in the past. When they find a good\nsolution they use it again and again. Such experience is part of what makes them experts.\n(Gamma et al., 1995, p. 1)\nThese reusable solutions that Gamma et al. refer to are design patterns. \nEach pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment,\nand then describes the core solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this\nsolution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice. (Alexander et al.,\n1977, p. x)\nHere, Alexander et al. were referring to patterns in architecture and town planning,\nbut core solutions in any area of design can be described in terms of patterns. It is\nthese patterns that will be extracted from the learning objects referred to earlier for\nreuse in creating new learning resources. The aim in doing this is to help learning\nobject designers by providing them with a set of design ideas in a structured way that\nwill clearly articulate the design problem and its solution (Goodyear, 2005). This will\nenable the designer to produce effective and adaptable learning resources in an effi-\ncient manner.\nIn simple terms, therefore, a pattern defines a common problem and proven\nsolution, which an experienced designer may choose to adopt. In practice,\npatterns are implemented as standard sequences of learning components (here\n\u2018pages\u2019) compounded from learning objects and resources. They are generally\nimplemented as a selection of reusable frameworks with slots for the learning\n122 S. Green et al.\ncomponents. For example, a particular type of learning activity might best be\npresented using a sequence composed of a text-based explanation of the princi-\nples involved, an illustrative animation, a review question and a practical exercise.\nThis learning pattern might be presented in a framework with four separate pages\neach embedding a separate learning object. This learning pattern forms a solution\nto a learning event, which can be reused in designing an appropriate learning\nsequence.\nPractical application: the Java project\nThe design and successful use of learning objects to complement a first-year degree\ncourse in the programming language Java is well documented as part of an innovative\nblended learning approach to the teaching of programming to first-year computing\nstudents (Boyle et al., 2003). The learning objects were designed by a team of subject\nexperts and a multimedia developer who authored them in Flash. Each learning\nobject was self-contained and was intended to be used either as a stand-alone\nresource or as an embedded link within a compound learning object. Each object was\nmade up of a sequence of frames, which themselves consisted of smaller, self-\ncontained, multimedia content. The aim of each learning object was to explain a\nparticular programming concept in the Java programming language through the use\nof examples. The main learning objects, their content and their sequencing were\ndesigned to follow a particular pedagogical method. The effectiveness of the learning\nresources was recognised by being one of a small number of recipients of the\nEuropean Academic Software Awards in 2004.2\nAnalysing learning objects\nThe Java project implemented a simple sequence of \u2018pages\u2019 of multimedia content.\nEach of the pages was of a particular type, or design, and served a specific purpose.\nEach learning object comprised a similar sequence of pages. User control over the\nsequence consists of simple forward, back and rewind navigation buttons. In a typical\nlearning object, the first page provided the title and a short description of the topic to\nbe covered. This was followed by pages of different types from simple static text and\nimages to pages that consisted of synchronised sequences of animations and text. The\ngeneral format of each sequence was: \n1. The title page.\n2. The concept page.\n3. The example page.\n4. The detailed explanation page.\n5. The practice page.\nA typical sequence consisted of at least five steps employing five basic page types. In\nsome learning objects, steps 3 and 4 were repeated with different programming exam-\nples and, often, there was more than one practice page.\nAccessibility and adaptability of learning objects 123\nLearning objects as patterns\nA major aim of our work is to provide design patterns that will enable new learning\nresources to be created from existing successful resources. From the analysis of the\nlearning objects used in the Java project, a pattern can be detected in the sequence of\npages that make up each learning object. The individual page types can also be\nregarded as patterns that describe a particular learner activity. Thus the main pattern\nmay be termed the sequencer pattern and it can be regarded as a compound pattern\n(i.e. one that is made up of other patterns).\nBuschmann et al. (1996) define design patterns, in part, as describing a particular\nrecurring design problem that arises in particular design contexts and presents a well-\nproven scheme for its solution. The learning object components, described here, have\nbeen extracted from existing successful learning resources and they are described in\na technology neutral manner, thus they can be considered as design patterns.\nHowever, Buschmann et al. also suggest that patterns should be described in a consis-\ntent and structured manner in terms of their context (the situation that gives rise to\nthe problem), the problem itself and the solution to that problem. This advice follows\nthe lead of Alexander et al. (1977), who describe their patterns in a similar manner\nand who refer to a collection of such patterns as a pattern language. It is also impor-\ntant that the learning object components that are defined using these patterns fully\ntake into account the need for reuse and adaptability. Thus these aspects need to be\naddressed in any documentation of a pattern. (An example of such documentation\n(as adapted by the authors) can be found in Appendix 1.)\nThe analysis of the original learning object results in the identification of a\npedagogical pattern that represents a simple framework into which a series of activi-\nties can be located. The implementation of the pattern is a simple page sequencer that\ncould be used for any simple linear sequence of activities. The pedagogy is thus not\nenforced; it is left up to the designer to select the appropriate activities and the correct\nordering of those activities. The activities themselves are also patterns and are imple-\nmented as templates into which appropriate content can be inserted. This content can\nalso be accompanied by metadata that help search engines find it, define its properties\nand indicate its level of adaptability. Based on these metadata, an automated service\ncan be identified to adapt the learning object components or patterns to different user\nrequirements.\nDiscussion: towards adaptable learning objects\nLearning object metadata\nThe provision of metadata was not of prime concern during the initial development\nof the learning objects in the Java Project. However, DC metadata are typically held\nwithin a separate catalogue. Consequently, identifying the main features of the\nresource, its learning objectives, media content, author and other relevant details can\nbe a second stage refinement based directly on a learning object or learning pattern\ndescription. Depending on the context in which the object is expected to be used, a\n124 S. Green et al.\nrange of descriptors may be indicated. In our context those descriptors that have\nappropriate matches to the anonymous PNPs (and which will generally appear in the\nnewly proposed \u2018adaptability\u2019 tag) are liable to be the most relevant.\nApplication profiles\nFor the purposes of this discussion we accept the extension of the definition of acces-\nsibility beyond disability, and define the relationship between a user and a resource\nas accessible when the characteristics of the resource as delivered match the user\u2019s\nneeds and preferences (Nevile, 2005). The definition of accessibility implied here is\nthat the relationship between the user and the resource is one that enables the user to\nmake sensory and cognitive contact with the content of the resource (IMS, 2004).\nAccording to the \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 statement the term disability has been re-defined as\na mismatch between the needs of the learner and the education offered, and it is\ntherefore not a personal trait but an artefact of the relationship between the learner\nand the learning environment or education delivery (Cooper et al., 2005). Accessibil-\nity, therefore, is the ability of the learning environment to adjust to the needs of all\nlearners and is determined by the flexibility of the environment (with respect to\npresentation, control methods and access modality) and the availability of adequate\n\u2018alternative-but-equivalent\u2019 content (Heath et al., 2005).\nThe needs and preferences of a user may arise from the context or environment the\nuser is in, the tools available (e.g. mobile devices, assistive technologies such as Braille\ndevices, voice recognition systems, or alternative keyboards, etc.), their background\nor a disability (physical, cognitive or sensory). According to the \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 vocab-\nulary, descriptions of needs and preferences are separated into display, control and\ncontent characteristics (as already described). The user\u2019s descriptions of their needs\nand preferences may change according to the context or occasion.\nAccessibility service\nIn order to achieve an accessible relationship between the resource and the user,\ndescriptions of user needs and preferences are checked against descriptions of\nresource components until they match. This process involves a description of a user\u2019s\ncontrol, display and content needs and preferences being matched with a description\nof the components of the learning object (Nevile et al., 2005). The delivery of the\nappropriate component will form an accessible relationship between the user and the\nlearning object. According to the \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 metadata overview, accessible\nsystems should be able to adjust the user interface of the learning environment, locate\nneeded resources and alter resources properties to match the needs and preferences\nof the user. This may involve the substitution, augmentation or transformation of\ncomponents of the resource such as changes in sensory modality. For the purposes of\nthis paper we will refer to an abstract transformation, augmentation and substitution\nservice (TASS), which is geared to our specific learning object application. However,\nthis can be viewed as a special instance of an \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 service.\nAccessibility and adaptability of learning objects 125\nAn example of a replacement occurs when a user accessing a learning object\nrequires a vision-free access to the resource, and therefore need alternatives to the\nvisual content contained in the primary resource of the learning object. As stated\npreviously, the profile of this user may actually be the same as the profile of a\nsighted user accessing the learning object on a PDA while driving: the user needs\nto access the learning object using non-visual techniques. For this relationship to\nbe accessible it is necessary to replace the visual element of the learning objects\nwith components that match the user\u2019s preferences of vision-free access. It is\nalso often the case that the original content of the resource has to be supple-\nmented, for example with the availability of a dictionary or captions, for an aural\ncomponent.\nThe process of retrieving and presenting accessible learning objects employs an\nadaptation of the \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 application service or TASS. This is presented in\nFigure 2.\nFigure 2. TASS: Transformation, Augmentation and Substitution ServiceIn simple terms, the TASS service is triggered by the user making a request through\nthe learning resource catalogue to the learning object repository. The TASS service\nchecks the catalogue for the objects accessibility element and compares it with the\nuser\u2019s profile in the PNP repository. Appropriate transformations, augmentations and\nsubstitutions are applied either directly through the local TASS managed resources\nor indirectly through a global \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 service.\nIn principle, transformation, augmentation and substitution may occur at any level\nbut would typically take place at the component or learning pattern level. Where a\nlearning object in itself is not considered accessible, its constituent components are\nexamined. If all individual components can be transformed, augmented or\nAccess4All\nService\nSearch\nEngine\nTASS\nUser\nLearning\nObject\nRepository\nPNP\nRepository\nLearning\nResource\nCatalogue\nFigure 2. TASS: Transformation, Augmentation and Substitution Service\n126 S. Green et al.\nsubstituted then the learning object can be reconstructed as an accessible object. In\ncertain cases, needs or preferences may require a substitute learning pattern. The\nlearning object can then be recreated from its constituent components but employing\nan alternate pattern. While the primary concern is one of accessibility of resources,\nthis feature could simply provide learners with learning patterns more suited to their\npersonal learning styles.\nConclusions and future work\nDrawing upon the work of the Java Project, the current research looks at ways to\nenrich and enhance these learning patterns in order to develop not only pedagogically\neffective, reusable but adaptable learning objects. The next stage of the research is to\ndevelop a tool to assist academics, without previous programming experience, in\ncreating reusable, retrievable and adaptable learning objects. By incorporating these\nlearning design patterns into a tool, an instrument can be developed to help the\nauthors (in this case university tutors) to design and develop learning objects. This\ntool will also provide the opportunity for the author to assign DC metadata to the\nlearning object in as simple a way as possible: this may include methods for intelli-\ngently inferring metadata, in order to make the process easier and quicker for the\nresource creator.\nAn interesting challenge in terms of this research is to deal with the integration of\n\u2018AccessForAll\u2019 and DC vocabularies. The development of an application profile for a\nset of user accessibility needs and preferences using the \u2018AccessForAll\u2019 vocabulary\ncan be easily discovered using the DC records. However there is considerable\ndisagreement on whether the PNP, which is a metadata record itself, should be inte-\ngrated within the DC framework. Further work also needs to concentrate on the\nrecursive nature of accessibility matching. The matching process (Figure 2) involves\nhaving a first \u2018main\u2019 resource identified and then tested against a PNP, while it would\nbe more efficient to first decompose the resource to find an alternative to one compo-\nnent and to transform, augment or substitute that component, before re-assembling\nand re-testing the resource. Another important issue, which has yet to be resolved, is\nwho is responsible for the substitution or augmentation service. It might be reason-\nable to expect a tutor employing a short video element to provide a transcript, but if\na user profile expresses a preference for British Sign Language can we really expect\nthis service to be provided by the content creator? The obvious conclusion, therefore,\nis that the provision of the adaptation service needs to be a collaborative venture, with\nadditional components or alternative learning patterns provided by those with the\nskills to do so. In essence this can lead to the creation of a wide range of additional or\nalternative learning objects; some of which may be considered true alternate\nresources, and others as virtual objects in that they may have no physical existence\nbut are supplied on-demand through transformations and advanced searches in\nresponse to a new PNP.\nIn conclusion, the newly emerging IMS and DC adaptability and accessibility stan-\ndards and the proposed PNPs are set to have a profound impact on the way we view\nAccessibility and adaptability of learning objects 127\nthe creation of digital content as well as the way it is presented to us. This paper\nsuggests an approach for designers of learning objects and learning patterns to\nrespond to this challenge. Assuming that appropriate tools can be created to allow\nnon-technical tutors to create learning objects based on these patterns, and assuming\nthat rich metadata can be collected or inferred from those resources, then learning\nobjects can be developed that are truly adaptable. The process of carrying out this\nfuture research and applying it to this application area will give a clearer indication to\nthose developing the standards of whether their approach is fundamentally sound and\nwhere refinements are needed.\nNotes\n1.

Extracts from a \u2018learning objects for programming\u2019 \npattern language\nThe following descriptions form a part of a small patterns catalogue. They are similar\nto the format used by Alexander et al.

When a new programming concept is to be learnt it is valuable to be able to\nsee an example program, or program fragment, and to have its operation explained in\nan interactive way.\nProblem.   In order to properly illustrate a programming concept or structure it is valu-\nable to \u2018walk through\u2019 an example. In a teacher-led class this is easily achieved but for\nself-study a dedicated resource needs to be designed that allows the learner to control\nthe pace and progress through the \u2018walk-through\u2019 process.\nSolution.   Using a multi-frame approach, an example program, or program fragment,\nis displayed in one frame where its execution can be simulated by highlighting each\nsection of the code in execution order. In a second window, the effect of the program\nexecution is demonstrated via an animation and in a third one, an explanation of the\nexecution is given.\nThe animation illustrates the code being executed by highlighting the appropriate\nparts of the code that are being executed. At the same time the animation is also\nstepped through and the text window changes at each step to describe the action of\nthe particular line, or section, of the program code. Thus there are three parts of the\nAccessibility and adaptability of learning objects 129\npage that are cycled through in synchronisation: the code, the commentary and the\nanimation.\nThe learner controls the operation via a button in the explanation window: this starts\nthe synchronised animation.\nReusabilty.
