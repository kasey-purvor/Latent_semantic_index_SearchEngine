Introduction1\n2\nThis paper is the second in a series of three; it describes an investigation into the effect of3\nmulti-axle machine systems on soil compaction in a controlled laboratory environment. It4\nexplains the beneficial behaviour of tracks found by Ansorge and Godwin (2007a) \u2013 the first5\npaper of the series - which compared the effect of single passes of both tyres and a track on6\nsoil compaction. The final paper will extend and develop prediction models to estimate the7\nincrease in soil density from both tyres and rubber tracks relating these to the experimental8\nresults in the earlier two papers.9\n10\nThe demand for higher productivity in agriculture leads to growing size and weight of11\nharvest machinery which in turn increases the danger of soil compaction (Raper, 2005). To12\noppose this trend, emphasis has to be put on the design of undercarriage systems aiming to13\nminimize the resulting soil compaction originating from field-traffic. Soil compaction could14\nbe minimized by using low ground pressure tyres (Hakansson, 2005) or equipping axles with15\ntracks (Ansorge and Godwin, 2007 a). However, little detail is known about the individual16\nsoil compaction behaviour of single tyres within whole machine configurations. Thus for17\nexample the question cannot be answered whether the benefit found for a rubber track is18\nmaintained after the passage of the rear axle in half track configurations or which rear tyre19\nsize would be appropriate in order not to exceed the soil density increase already caused by20\nthe front axle.21\n22\nSingle axle configurations have been investigated in detail by Ansorge and Godwin23\n(2007a) and showed a benefit of a rubber track with respect to soil density change and24\npenetrometer resistance compared to tyres. Therefore the subsequent step was to investigate25\nthe implications of the effect of the passage of a tyre on the second (rear) axle. Thus, the aim26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n3\nof the study was to investigate the effect of the passage of whole machine configurations on1\nsoil compaction and quantify the total soil density increase caused by different combine2\nharvester undercarriage systems, i.e. half-tracks, common wheeled configurations and a3\nlighter older machine configuration.4\n5\nThe second part of this paper describes the effect of a track on soil strength immediately6\nbelow the surface, which was found in penetrometer resistance measurements, by7\ninvestigating longitudinal soil displacement.8\n9\n2. Literature Review10\n11\nThe importance of soil compaction and its economical consequences were shown by12\nHakansson and Reeder (1994) who report that soil compaction caused by tyres at an axle load13\nof 10 t penetrated the soil to a depth of 500 mm measurably and that it possibly permanently14\nreduces crop yields. The demand for lighter machinery rises due to such results. The15\nimportance in reducing vehicle weight as a mean of reducing soil compaction was shown in a16\nstudy by Smith and Dickson (1990). Weight reduction by using light alloys and composite17\nmaterials rather than steel products has its limits due to increased machinery cost. Smaller18\nmachinery on the contrary cannot be operated at the same economical efficiency as larger19\nmachines. These two arguments strengthen the need for a better undercarriage design.20\n21\nAnsorge and Godwin (2007a) discussed the literature with respect to tyres and tracks in22\ndetail and therefore only a short summary is given here. The findings from literature could not23\nbe generalized as some studies reported advantages (Bashford et al., 1988; Rusanov, 1991) or24\ndisadvantages (Blunden et al., 1994) for tracks which are summarized by Alakukku et al.25\n(2003). Watts et al. (2005) found that maximum rut depths were caused by heavy trailers26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n4\nrather than by tractors and, moreover, showed that crawler tractors created the least soil1\ndamage supporting tracked undercarriage systems. A similar benefit was found in an infield2\ninvestigation for sugar beet harvesters by Brandhuber et al. (2006). The tracked type3\nundercarriage system caused less reduction in hydraulic conductivity than its wheeled4\ncounterpart. Ansorge and Godwin (2007,a) report a clear benefit of a rubber track at a load of5\n10.5 \u2013 12 t in comparison to tyres laden to 10.5 t with respect to soil displacement and6\nresulting soil density increase for both a uniform soil profile and a layered field situation7\nreplicated in a soil bin laboratory.8\n9\nAccording to Hadas (1994) some field studies indicate that soil compaction blamed to the10\npassage of high axle loads can be attributed to other processes and even natural variabilities,11\ntoo. Thus it can be concluded that it is very important to minimize the environmental12\nvariability and their impact on the results which raises the demand for controlled repeatable13\nlaboratory studies.14\n15\nOnly few studies distinguished soil compaction caused by single axles in literature. One of16\nthese studies is Pytka (2005) who showed that the largest increase in soil deformation is17\ncaused after the first and second pass of a tractor tyre. The additional soil deformation from18\nsubsequent passages decreases. The studies reviewed by Ansorge and Godwin (2007, a) did19\nnot distinguish soil density increase caused by single passes compared to multiple passes with20\ndifferent tyre configurations in detail. None of them investigated the influence of tyres21\nfollowing a track on soil density increase. Therefore the focus of this second part will be on22\nthe additional soil compaction caused by the subsequent pass of the rear axle.23\n24\n25\n26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n5\n1\n3. Methods2\n3\nThe effect of simulated self propelled combine harvesters with total machine weights4\nranging from 11 \u2013 33 t and equipped with tyres, or a track followed by a tyre, on soil5\ncompaction was investigated in a full size study in a controlled laboratory environment.6\n7\nThe individual rubber track, large harvester tyres and implement (rear-combine) tyres and8\nloads used in the study are specified in Table 1. The front axle of modern combine harvester9\nconfigurations was simulated using either a track laden to 12 t or the 900\/65 R32 tyre laden to10\n10.5 t at a recommended inflation pressure of 1.9 bar. These two units were combined with11\nthe largest (700mm\/4.5t\/1.0bar) and the smallest (500-70mm\/4.5t\/2.3bar) of the four12\nimplement tyres (Ansorge and Godwin, 2007a) to simulate the rear axle of the combine. The13\nwhole-machine abbreviations are listed in Table 2. Additionally, a narrow tyre combination of14\nthe 680mm\/10.5t\/2.2bar followed by the 500-85mm\/4.5t\/1.4 was investigated. In addition, the15\n900\/65 R32 tyre was laden to 5 t at 0.5 bar inflation pressure and passed three times over the16\nsoil to represent an alternative hypothetical three axle machine concept. These machine17\nconfigurations with total weights of 30 \u2013 33 t were compared to a configuration representing18\nthe design of the Claas Dominator, manufactured in Europe from 1970, with a weight of 11 t19\nand equipped with 23.1-26 tyres on the front axle at 4 t and 1.2 bar inflation pressure and20\n11.5\/80-15.3 tyres at 1.5 t and 2 bar inflation pressure on the rear axle; constituting the21\nmedium tyre size configuration available for this particular machine.22\n23\nSoil compaction was assessed by embedding talcum powder lines as a tracer in the soil24\nduring preparation to measure soil displacement and soil density changes. Additionally dry25\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n6\nbulk density and cone penetrometer resistance were recorded. Full details on measured1\nparameters are given in Ansorge and Godwin (2007, a).2\n3\nThe soil used was a sandy loam (Cotternham series; King, 1969) with 17% clay, 17% silt4\nand 66% sand; the water content was maintained at 10% dry base during the studies. A5\nuniform soil condition was prepared to a dry bulk density of 1.4 g\/cm3 which was chosen to6\nrepresent soil conditions with a relatively low bearing capacity where tracks and large size7\ntyres would have value in agricultural practice. The initial penetrometer resistance profile for8\na uniform soil condition is shown in Fig. 10 with a resistance of 0.9 \u2013 1 MPa from 0.2 to 0.79\nm depth. This uniform profile was achieved by rolling each 50 mm deep layer once after it10\nhad been placed onto the underlying soil and levelled with a blade. Obviously the soil11\nunderneath was further compacted when the subsequent layer received its virgin compression12\nwith a roller of 3.5 kN and 0.6 m diameter at a speed of 1 m\/s. However, as the penetrometer13\nresistance profile in Fig. 10 indicated, the resulting overall profile was uniform.14\n15\n4. Results16\n4.1. Whole machine studies17\n4.1.1. Soil displacement18\n19\nFigure 1 shows that the tyre undercarriage systems created a significantly larger soil20\ndisplacement i.e. increase in soil density than the rubber track type under carriage systems. A21\nclear differentiation is visible between the tracked types compared to the wheeled types with22\nthe exception of the three passes of the 900 tyre each with a reduced load of 5 t. All23\ntreatments were significantly different from each other except the two tracks and the three24\npasses of the 900mm\/5t\/0.5bar. Thus the influence of the rear tyre size had a greater effect25\nfollowing a tyre on the front axle than following a track.26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n7\nTo investigate the effect of the rear tyre in more detail, Fig. 2 shows the soil displacement1\ncaused by both the front tyre\/track alone and after the passage of the rear tyre. The additional2\nsoil displacement caused by the 700mm\/4.5t\/1.0bar rear tyre was insignificant for both tyre3\nand track. However, the additional soil displacement caused by the 500-70mm\/4.5t\/2.3bar4\ntyre was significant for the tyre in front. An insignificant increase in soil displacement for the5\ntrack followed by the 500-70mm\/4.5t\/2.3bar was visible at the surface, yet, below a depth of6\n300 mm this data converged with the other curves for tracks. However, if the 500-7\n70mm\/4.5t\/2.3bar tyre followed the 900mm\/10.5t\/1.9bar tyre the additional soil displacement8\nwas significantly greater over the profile to a depth of 450 mm where the data converged with9\nthe 900mm\/10.5t\/1.9bar tyre followed by 700mm\/4.5t\/1.0bar. Thus, rear tyre size has greater10\nsignificance in relation to soil displacement after the passage of a leading tyre, than when11\nfollowing a track. This is shown in detail in Fig. 3, which shows that the magnitude of the12\nincrease from the additional passage of the 500-70mm\/4.5t\/2.3bar compared to the13\n700mm\/4.5t\/1.0bar was smaller for the track and the differences merge at shallower depth14\nthan the differences for the tyres.15\n16\nThe track not only maintained its smaller rut depth, but also had a smaller increase in rut17\ndepth from subsequent passages. For the track the rear tyre only affected the soil to the depth18\nto which conventional cultivation treatments were carried out as long as the rear tyre load19\ncould be carried and distributed by the compact zone created just below the surface by the20\ntrack. We attempt to explain the reasons for the benefit of the tracks in Section 4.2.21\n22\nAdditional studies were conducted to compare the track systems with a smaller combine23\nharvester having a total weight of 11 t on the following tyre sizes (Front: 23.1-26; Rear:24\n11.5\/80-15.3) with an inflation pressure of 1.2 bar and a load of 4 t on the front wheel and 1.525\nt load at 2 bar on the rear wheel. This tyre combination is in the middle of the available range.26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n8\nThe data is shown in Fig. 4 and compared to a tracked machine which shows that the soil1\ndisplacement below a tracked machine was not significantly different from that of a wheeled2\nmachine of one third of the weight.3\n4\nThe least significant difference bars (LSD) have all the same length because they compare5\nthe overall treatments whereby variability with depth has been taken into consideration.6\n7\n4.1.2. Penetrometer resistance8\n9\nThe penetrometer resistance profiles resulting from different undercarriage systems are10\nshown in Fig. 5 which reveals two distinctive groups: (a) track and (b) tyre, in comparison11\nwith the undisturbed control. The track data exhibits a higher penetrometer resistance near the12\nsurface at approximately 150 mm which then reduces almost exponentially with depth. This13\nindicated that the soil had its greatest strength at the soil surface; however, the penetrometer14\nfirst needed to fully engage with the soil to show the peak penetrometer resistance.15\nConsequently, the highest reading of penetrometer resistance was about 40 mm below the16\nsurface of the rut. Both track treatments were not significantly different from each other, but17\nfrom the group of tyres. The tyre data in Fig. 5 b was overall more uniform and showed a18\nslightly smaller magnitude at the surface, but larger values below 250 \u2013 300 mm than the19\ntrack. All two axle configurations had similar penetrometer resistance and hence there were20\nno significant differences in penetrometer resistance for the 900mm\/10.5t\/1.9bar treatments21\nand the 680mm\/10.5t\/2.2bar treatment. In comparison, the three axle configuration was22\nsignificantly different from the other wheeled undercarriage treatments due to its lower23\npenetrometer resistance over the entire depth.24\n25\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n9\nThe increase in penetrometer resistance caused by the rear tyre (500-70mm\/4.5t\/2.3bar) can1\nbe seen in Fig. 6 for both the track and the 900mm\/10.5t\/1.9bar tyre. In both cases the rear2\ntyre caused a small but significant increase in penetrometer resistance over the full depth3\nrange.4\n5\nSimilar to the data from the soil displacement, the penetrometer resistance caused by an 11t6\nmachine was compared to that of a tracked machine in Fig 7. Statistically there were no7\ndifferences overall. The tracked machine showed its pronounced peak at the surface, however,8\nat a depth of 300 mm the penetrometer resistance merged with that of the lighter wheeled9\nmachine, supporting the soil displacement results from Fig. 4 and leading to the overall10\nsimilarity between the two treatments.11\n12\n4.1.3. Dry bulk density13\n14\nThere were no significant differences in DBD among individual under carriage systems15\ndue to the inherent large variations caused by the measurement of DBD shown in Fig. 8. The16\ninitial DBD was 1.43 g\/cm3. Grouping the undercarriage systems into the average wheel and17\naverage track type system, final DBD values were 1.59 g\/cm3 and 1.56 g\/cm3, respectively.18\nThis order corresponded to the measurement of soil displacement shown in Fig. 1, whereby19\ntracks caused a smaller increase in DBD than tyres. The difference of 0.03 g\/cm3 between the20\ntwo groups was not statistically significant. The tendency of the DBD agreed for gravimetric21\nDBD compared to the estimated increase in DBD utilizing the slope of the soil displacement22\ngraphs; i.e. both times the DBD was greater after the wheeled than after the tracked machines.23\nThe resolution of the soil displacement measurement was greater than that of the DBD.24\n25\n26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n10\n4.1.4. Discussion of whole machine Studies1\n2\nThe small variability within the results satisfies the requirement imposed by Hadas (1994)3\nfor a study with small variability when comparing the soil density increase of different4\ntreatments.5\n6\nFor wheeled machinery the findings from Pytka (2005) can be corroborated that the largest7\npart of soil displacement is caused in the first pass. However, Pytka (2005) also reported soil8\ndisplacement for the 2nd pass. In contrast, this study showed that the additional soil9\ncompaction originating from the subsequent pass could reach zero if the second tyre did not10\nexceed the bearing capacity of the soil created with the first pass as for example with the11\n900mm\/10.5t\/1.9bar+700mm\/4.5t\/1.0bar configuration. For the tracked undercarriage systems12\nthe strong layer at the surface supported the load without further compaction of the underlying13\nsoil.14\n15\nThe advantage for a rubber track with respect to soil displacement, penetrometer resistance16\nand soil density increase reported by Ansorge and Godwin (2007, a) were maintained after the17\npassage of the rear axle. Therefore the advantages for rubber tracks reported by Bashford et18\nal. (1994) and Rusanov (1991) can be supported even after the passage of an additional rubber19\ntyre following the track. The same holds true for the results from Watts et al. (2005) who20\nshowed that crawler tractors created the least soil damage. Brandhuber et al. (2006) found the21\nsame beneficial results for tracks in comparison to tyres for sugar beet harvesters in an in-22\nfield study whereby the tracked undercarriage system caused less reduction in hydraulic23\nconductivity than its wheeled counterpart.24\n25\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n11\nA three axle tyre configuration with 5 t load per tyre caused similar vertical soil1\ndisplacement compared to a track with a load of 12 t followed by a rear tyre with a load of 4.52\nt. An undercarriage unit with a track unit on the front axle and a gross weight of 33 t resulted3\nin a similar vertical soil displacement to that of an 11 t combine harvester on commercially4\nfitted normal front and rear tyre sizes.Therefore machines with either large section width tyres5\nand low payloads or tracked or half tracked vehicles could be the answer to satisfy the6\ndemand for increasing agricultural machinery while minimizing soil compaction. The7\ncomparison of the soil displacement caused by a half-track combine at 33 t to a wheeled8\ncombine harvester at 11 t showed, that modern heavy weight machinery must not necessarily9\nexceed the soil displacement that would have been (or has already been) caused by older10\nlighter machines on medium available tyre sizes. By using smart undercarriage design the11\ndemand from Smith and Dickson (1990) for reducing weight in order to reduce soil12\ncompaction can therefore be contradicted. Hakansson and Reeder (1994) reported that soil13\ncompaction caused by 10 t axle loads penetrated the soil to a depth of 500 mm measurably.14\nAssuming a very weak field situation this is in agreement with the results of this study for15\nwheeled undercarriage systems showing a residual soil displacement between 500 \u2013 600 mm16\ndepth. In contrast to this soil displacement for half \u2013 track undercarriage systems has17\ndecreased to zero at about 500 \u2013 600 mm depth. The residual soil displacement for wheeled18\ncommon combine harvester tyre combinations demonstrates their possible impact on the19\nsubsoil.20\n21\n4.2. Track behaviour22\n4.2.1. Discussion of track behaviour23\n24\nThe explanation for the high surface penetration resistance caused by the tracks at a load of25\n10.5 \u2013 12 t at the surface shown in Section 4.1.2 and by Ansorge and Godwin (2007a) will be26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n12\nconsidered in this section. Whilst initially of some concern, it is much more easily removed1\nthan the deeper compaction caused by the tyres (Ansorge and Godwin, 2007a). For reduced or2\nno-tillage systems this layer might cause some problems, although Ansorge (2005) found a3\nlarger effect of un-tilled wheel ruts than track ruts for broadcast sown oil seed rape. This layer4\nis also of value by reducing the subsequent amount of soil displacement caused by the rear5\ntyres, compared to that following a wheel as shown in Fig. 3.6\n7\nThe high penetrometer resistance was thought to originate from either vertical soil8\ncompaction close to the surface (possibly by vibrations, pressure peaks from rollers, or long9\ncontact time) or the application of shear forces during the passage of the track.10\n11\nIn a first instance the possibility of a larger vertical soil density increase at the surface will12\nbe investigated. If the high penetrometer resistance was caused by vertical soil compaction13\nthis would be visible from the soil displacement curves with depth at the surface. Hence, the14\naverage slope of the soil displacement lines should indicate a larger increase in soil density15\nfor the tracks than for tyres in the top 300 mm. Figure 9 shows the relevant data from16\nAnsorge and Godwin (2007a) including the best fit linear regression lines. Independent of the17\ndepths considered, the average slope for the tracks was always larger than the slope for the18\ntyres (with the exception of the 800mm\/10.5t\/1.25bar) indicating less vertical soil19\ndisplacement and compaction at the surface. If vibrations transmitted through the track onto20\nthe soil caused the peak in penetrometer resistance, this should also have been visible in soil21\ndisplacement curves.22\n23\nAnother experimental result shedding light on the hard layer was the similar vertical soil24\ndisplacement caused by the rear\/implement tyres to that of the rubber track (Ansorge and25\nGodwin, 2007a). However, the penetrometer resistance results for the smaller implement tyres26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n13\ndid not show a peak close to the surface and as shown in Fig. 10, merging of the data for the1\ntrack and rear tyres occurred at a depth of less than 300 mm.2\n3\nAverage contact pressure for the track was virtually identical to that of the 500-4\n85mm\/4.5t\/1.4bar tyre at 83 kPa and 85 kPa, respectively (Ansorge and Godwin, 2007 b). For5\nthe 600mm\/4.5t\/1.4bar tyre a larger contact pressure of 110 kPa was measured. Nevertheless6\nall three treatments caused similar soil displacement. Thus their increases in soil density agree7\nwell with their average contact pressures. As the true pressure distribution underneath a track8\nwas not uniform, one could argue that the dense layer was caused by the pressure peaks9\nunderneath the track; this was not visible from the study of the vertical soil displacement.10\nHence, neither both the absolute contact pressure or its distribution could be the cause of the11\nhigher penetrometer resistance. The same reasoning applies to vibrations transmitted to the12\nsoil and causing compaction.13\n14\nSince the peak in penetrometer resistance had no counterpart in the vertical soil15\ndisplacement curves or in the original soil profiles in the soil bin laboratory, no lateral16\ndisplacements were found, and we did not measure displacements in the direction of travel17\nour only conclusion can be that these displacements are the source of the hard layer. In turn18\nsuch motions can only be caused by shear forces in the direction of travel.19\n20\nThe different slip behaviour of a tyre and a track could be responsible for this increase in21\nsoil strength indicated by the peak in penetrometer resistance. Calculating shear displacement22\nresulted in twice the displacement underneath a track compared to that for a tyre according to23\nWong (2001). This seems rather strange as the track operated generally at a lower slip (5 %)24\ncompared to tyres (10 %) in this investigation (Ansorge, 2005) to develop the same thrust25\nnecessary to propel itself. The shear displacement, however, is gained by the integration of26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n14\nslip velocity underneath the implement over the distance traveled. Hence the long contact area1\nof the track (2.4 m) coupled with constant slip velocity led to a greater total shear2\ndisplacement. The resulting constant shear strain application over the entire contact length3\nadditionally increased plastic shear displacement. Total length of the contact area for the tyre4\nwas about half (1.2 m) of that of the track, whereby the slip velocity depended on the position5\nof the soil with respect to the tyre. The highest slip velocity occurs at the beginning of the6\ncontact patch when the tyre surface velocity is greater than that of the deformed section of the7\ntyre under its centre line due to differences between the actual and the rolling radius (Wong,8\n2001). Thus shear strain decreases in traveling direction from the edge of the tyre to the9\ncentre.10\n11\nThis decrease in shear strain can be compared to an impact load allowing for some elastic12\nrecovery. The track on the contrary applies the shear force for a greater length and thus an13\nextended period of time thereby compacting the soil horizontally and allowing less elastic14\nrecovery due to the spring-damper behavior of the soil. The spring-damper behavior of soil15\nduring compaction was exemplarily shown by Aboaba (1969) who changed the contact time16\nof a roller by altering forward velocities.17\n18\nThe actual longitudinal soil displacement measured in the soil bin laboratory and caused by19\na self propelled track and tyre will be discussed in the next Section.20\n21\n4.2.2. Longitudinal soil displacement caused by tyre and track22\n23\nTo shed light onto the question how much the soil is displaced longitudinally by tyres and24\ntracks the total longitudinal soil movement was determined by embedding a series of vertical25\nsand columns into the soil. These columns are 5 mm in diameter at a spacing of 50 mm and26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n15\nreach to a depth of 250 mm in the centreline of the path of the tyre or track. After the passage1\nof the 900mm\/10.5t\/1.9bar tyre and T12 track, respectively, these were carefully excavated2\nalong their centre line thereby showing the direction of the movement of the soil throughout3\nthe surface 250 mm. The position of each sand column was digitized using the same method4\nas for the determination of soil displacement.5\n6\nFigure 11 shows a uniform forward soil movement of the sand columns numbered 1 \u2013 107\nclose to the surface after the passage of the 900mm\/10.5t\/1.9bar. The arrow indicates the8\ndirection of travel. To aid the interpretation of soil movement within the column, Fig. 119\nincludes vertical lines representing the average longitudinal position of the lower 100 mm for10\neach sand column. At the surface the forward movement of the soil varied depending on the11\nposition relative to the lug. The columns on the back of a lug exhibited only a forward12\nmovement close to the surface, but not at depth (Column 1, 6, and 10 from left); all other13\ncolumns tilted forward. The soil movement caused by a rubber track at 12 t is shown in Fig.14\n12; these show an alternating backward and forward soil movement close to the surface,15\nwhereby the backward movement was more pronounced than the forward movement. The16\nfront face of a lug appears to push the soil slightly forwards (Columns 2, 5, and 8 from left),17\nbut the remaining section of the lug and the rear area push the soil backwards. The void-lug18\nratios in these particular cross sections were 0.43 for the track and 1 for the tyre, representing19\na larger proportion of lugs for the track within the contact area.20\n21\nIn order to conduct a statistical analysis of the longitudinal soil movement below the tyre22\neach column within Fig. 11 was assigned either B or F to account for the tilt direction of the23\nsoil; B - indifferently to backward; F \u2013 forward. The assigned order was from left to right:24\nBFFFFBFFFB. Within Fig. 12 the sand columns of the track treatment were assigned either25\nB, F, or I depending on whether the column was tilted backward, forward or indifferent with a26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n16\nshear failure below the lug and the following order was assigned: BFIBFIB. The statistical1\nanalysis conducted for the entire length of each column and accounting for the treatment2\n(track or a tyre), for the tilt direction and allowing an interaction of tilt direction with depth,3\nrevealed all parameters to significantly describe the observed sand column movement.4\n5\nTo investigate the soil movement with depth the columns were divided into a lower and an6\nupper part. The lower 100 mm were taken as a reference basis and hence excluded from the7\ncomparison because of the assumption that this depth was not affected by the treatment. The8\nassumption was confirmed by an analysis for the values from the lower 100 mm (track9\nposition -0.0008 mm, tyre position +0.0133 mm, LSD 0.51 mm). All parameters used to10\ndescribe the data did not significantly influence the remaining variation and thus indicated a11\nrandom distribution of the data around zero (p-values >0.9). For the upper 150 mm tilt, drive12\nunit, and the interaction of tilt with depth were significant parameters describing the variation13\nwithin the data. The mean position for the rubber track unit of the top 150 mm was -4.45 mm14\nwhich was significantly different from zero. This compared to a mean position of 2.05 mm for15\nthe wheel which was not significantly different from zero with an LSD equal to 2.18 mm.16\nLooking at the assigned tilt variables B, F, and I for both treatments, tilts B and I were17\nnegative and tilt F was significantly different from both indicating a positive, i.e. a forward18\nsoil movement.19\n20\nIn further support of the previous argument for shear displacement causing the peak in21\npenetrometer resistance it is interesting to note that the longitudinal movement which ceases22\nat approximately 150 mm is equivalent to the point where the magnitude of penetrometer23\nresistance drops back to that of the rear tyres (Fig. 10) and even below front tyres (Fig. 6).24\n25\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n17\nHence it was shown that in this very situation overall the track caused a significant back-1\nward soil movement at the surface whereas the wheel tended to cause a forward soil2\nmovement which was not significantly different from zero. As available slip data could not be3\naccurately assigned over the distance the units travelled across the sand columns, it could be4\nargued that the track had positive slip and the tyre negative slip thus causing these differences.5\nHowever, the sand columns enclose three replications of lug-void cycles over a distance of6\n0.5 m and the data in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 did not indicate a change in behaviour. Therefore7\nthe slip conditions could be regarded as constant with respect to longitudinal soil movement8\nover the distance traveled and as both units are driven, it must be positive slip. Moreover9\npenetrometer resistance randomly taken over the length of the soil bin always showed a10\nhigher surface strength for the track. These findings may change under the application of11\ngreater thrusts\/slips.12\n13\n4.2.3. Discussion of measured longitudinal soil displacement in contrast with literature14\nAccording to Wong (2001) soil movement below a tyre is accompanied by a flow pattern15\nincluding two opposing flow directions. There are two exceptional extreme conditions. At 10016\n% slip, soil will only flow backward. For a locked wheel, only a soil wedge will be formed17\npushing the soil forward whereby the size of the wedge depends on sinkage and the18\ncorresponding rake angle of the tyre. Any slip condition between these two extremes will19\ninclude both forward and backward flow of soil. The higher the slip, the larger the backward20\nmovement will become. Following the soil trajectories given by Wong (2001) for three21\nwheels (towed wheel, 37 % slip, and 63 % slip) on a clay soil, at a slip range of about 10 \u2013 1522\n% the integrated longitudinal soil movement below a tyre could be zero due to the equilibrium23\nof backward and forward soil flow. This was observed in this condition for the tyre. For the24\ntrack on the contrary, the bow wave and therefore forward soil movement was smaller due to25\nthe smaller rake angle and reduced sinkage. However, the backward flow pattern was more26\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n18\npronounced due to the constant slip conditions leading to an overall backward soil movement.1\nTherefore the measured longitudinal displacement agrees with the theory suggested by earlier2\nliterature.3\n4\nFigure 13 shows backward soil movement at the very beginning of a passage of a5\ntrack\/tyre and agreed with the results above. When a track started, soil was moved backwards6\nas shown by the left hand figure which shows a clear shear failure boundary compared to the7\nedge of the footprint from the track. In contrast, after the start of the tyre, no shear8\ndisplacement could be seen, see right hand figure, although the soil lug disturbance pattern9\nindicate high slipage at the start.10\n11\n5. Conclusions12\n13\n(1) The smaller increase in soil density for a self propelled track with loads of 10.5 and 12 t14\ncompared to self propelled tyres at recommended and at half recommended inflation15\npressure with a load of 10.5 t found by Ansorge and Godwin (2007a) on weak uniform16\nsoil conditions in a soil bin laboratory were maintained after the additional passage of the17\nrear axle tyre. A typical wheeled combine increased the soil density by 19 % compared to18\na tracked machine with an increase of 14 %.19\n(2) The effect of the rear axle tyre size had less effect on soil conditions following a front axle20\ntrack unit than a tyre. Soil displacement increased by 6 mm compared to 12 mm for the21\ntyre over the same depth range and extended to a shallower depth (300 mm) only after the22\ntrack. This was due to the bearing capacity of the stronger layer in the top 150 mm23\nobserved from the penetrometer studies.24\nAnsorge, D. and Godwin, R.J., 2008. The Effect of Tyres and a Rubber Track at High Axle Loads on Soil\nCompaction: Part 2: Multi-Axle Machine Studies. Biosystems Engineering 99 (3) pp. 338 \u2013 347.\n19\n(3) A hypothetical three axle tyre configuration with 5 t load caused similar vertical soil1\ndisplacement compared to track loaded to 12 t followed by a smaller rear tyre loaded to2\n4.5 t.3\n(4) An undercarriage unit with a front axle unit loaded to 33 t resulted in a similar vertical soil4\ndisplacement to that of an 11 t combine harvester on the commercially fitted normal front5\nand rear tyre sizes.6\n(5) The overall configuration of the undercarriage system of the combine harvester was more7\nimportant than individual weight on a single axle.8\n(6) The high penetrometer resistance for the track at the surface is caused by the application9\nof shear for a longer period of time than for the tyre leading to a larger shear10\ndisplacement. This longitudinal movement was limited to the uppermost 150 mm of the11\nsoil for both, tyre and track under these conditions.12\n13\n14\nAcknowledgement15\n16\nThe authors want to thank the Claas Company, Harsewinkel, Germany, for its support and17\nGordon Spoor for useful suggestions concerning the work.
