When a dataset \nincludes a large proportion of missing data, subsequent analysis may be subject to \nbias unless dealt with appropriately. Possible approaches include complete case or \navailable case analysis, joint or pattern mixture modelling and use of imputation [1]. \nImputation is the substitution of an estimated value for one that is missing. There are \ntwo types of imputation \u2013 single value or multiple imputation.  \n \nOutcomes from health-related quality of life (QoL) instruments are considered. \nMissing QoL outcomes are likely to be informative [2,3] . For example, patients with \npoorer QoL may have impaired physical functioning and may feel fatigued, therefore \nmay be less likely to complete questionnaires. Conversely those who feel well might \nregard the questionnaires as no longer relevant, thereby not filling them in. There are \ntwo types of missing data: missing form (the focus here) when the whole \nquestionnaire is missing, and missing item, when the form is returned with one or \nmore items unanswered.  \n \nThere is extensive literature on the accuracy of different imputation strategies [4-12]. \nA number of case studies and simulation studies have shown multiple imputation (MI) \n  \nto be superior to simple imputation in the presence of informative missing data [4-12]. \nHowever in these studies the missing data have been created artificially and the \nmissing data patterns are predetermined or prespecified. It is not surprising that some \nimputation methods perform poorly for particular prespecified mechanisms. For \nexample, simple methods such as mean imputation are only useful if the data are \nlikely missing completely at random (MCAR). If not MCAR, this type of method is \nlikely to produce biased results. Fielding et al. [2] showed that simple imputation was \ninadequate in the presence of missing not at random (MNAR) data and suggested MI \nmight be more appropriate.    \n \nThe accuracy of different strategies of dealing with the missing data can never be \ntruly assessed since the data are by definition \u2018missing\u2019. However, this paper takes an \napproach that compares imputation results against data subsequently recovered using \na reminder system for questionnaires.  This allows the relative efficiency of different \nmethods to be assessed. Use of imputation should always be regarded with \ncircumspection, and we discuss the merits of the different approaches.  \n \nDealing with missing data \nImputation \nImputation involves replacing a missing value with a \u2018best guess\u2019. This could be \nbased on previously observed scores (e.g. the last observation available for a \nparticular person), expert opinion or previous studies. Additional data that may inform \nimputation are often contained within a dataset and can be utilised. The imputation \nprocess results in a complete dataset on which standard statistical analysis can be \n  \ncarried out. However, imputation cannot completely replace lost information and \nshould be used with caution. Although a seemingly complete dataset is created, it is \none that has been augmented in some sense and does not compensate for full \ninformation [13]. Imputed values will never be completely representative of the true \nvalue.  \nSimple imputation \n \nIn simple imputation a single value is substituted for one that is missing. Methods \nconsist of those using data from all patients (cross-sectional) and those using \ninformation specific to the patient (longitudinal). Many cross-sectional methods exist \n[13] but those used here are:  simple mean imputation (mean score from observed data \nat a given assessment); minimum or maximum value of the observed data; and \nregression (using QoL and other variables in the dataset). For regression imputation \nthe covariates associated with reminder response and the outcome can be identified \nusing standard statistical tests such as independent t-tests and chi-squared tests as \nappropriate. A common but na\u00efve longitudinal method is last observation carried \nforward (LOCF), where the last observed value is carried forward to replace a missing \nobservation. This is sometimes referred to as last value carried forward. A similar \nmethod is baseline carried forward, where the baseline value is carried forward to \neach missing value.   \n \nEach of these simple imputation methods provides a deterministic rule for imputing a \nsingle value for each that is missing. The advantage of simple imputation is that it is \neasy to carry out. However, a major disadvantage, especially for methods based on \nmean values or regression, is that variances of the variable undergoing imputation \n  \ntend to become underestimated, leading to reduced standard errors which can impact \non test statistics, p-values and confidence intervals [14]. \nMultiple imputation \nMI can overcome some of the problems associated with simple imputation. For each \nmissing value, instead of a single deterministic estimate, a random value is selected \nfrom its distribution. This introduces uncertainty in the imputed values, and preserves \nthe random variability (variance) of the variables. This process is repeated, generating \nmultiple randomly different datasets.  Each dataset is analysed separately and the \nresults combined using Rubin\u2019s method [15]. Although a single random imputation \nmay be reasonable if the proportion of missing data is small, without special \ncorrective measures the inferences tend to overstate precision because the between-\nimputation component of variability is omitted. Imputations may in principle be \ncreated under any kind of assumptions or model for the missing data mechanism and \nthe resulting inferences will be valid under that mechanism.  Several approaches were \nused for randomly sampling from the distribution of the items with missing values \nand these are described. \nApproaches for monotone missingness \nA monotone missing data pattern occurs when no further observations are made on a \npatient following a number of completed assessments. For monotone missing data \npossible MI methods include: regression models, predictive mean match models or \npropensity scores. For the regression method a model is fitted to the continuous \noutcome with explanatory variables constructed from those covariates available \nwithin the dataset. Based on the fitted regression model, a new regression model is \n  \nsimulated from the posterior predictive distribution of the parameters and this is used \nto impute the missing values for each variable [16].  \n \nThe predictive mean match model also fits a regression model and obtains a set of \npredicted values. For each piece of missing data, a set of observed values for which \nthe predicted values are closest to the predicted value of the missing observation are \nobtained. One of these observed values is randomly selected and imputed for the \nmissing value. An advantage of this method over regression is that imputed values are \nalways within the range of the data and thus ensures the imputed values are plausible.  \n \nThe third method for monotone missingness is the propensity score method. For a \nvariable with missing values, a score is generated for each observation to estimate the \nprobability that the observation is missing and this is called the propensity score. The \nobservations are then grouped (usually five) according on these propensity scores. \nWithin each group a set of observed scores are randomly selected with replacement to \ncreate a new set of observed scores. For each missing value an observation from this \nnew set of observed scores is randomly selected and imputed. The disadvantage of \nthis method is that information about correlations of repeated measures is lost. For all \nthese methods formulation of the imputation model is an important step [17]. Failure \nto accommodate the model structure appropriately can cause bias in the resulting \nanalysis [18]. Additional variables which are related to both missingness and outcome \nshould also be included in the imputation model [1].  \nIntermittent missingness \nIntermittent missing data occurs when one or more observations for a patient were \nmissing before one was observed. For intermittent missing data, the Markov Chain \n  \nMonte Carlo (MCMC) method can be used. The exact detail behind MCMC is \nprovided elsewhere [15-16, 19]. MCMC can be used in two ways for intermittent \nmissingness. The first approach applies MCMC on all the intermittent missing data \nand the second uses MCMC to make the data monotone and then employs one of the \nother more flexible monotone methods for the remainder of the data.  \nSoftware for imputation \nSimple imputation does not require any specialist software and the routines can be \nprogrammed into any standard statistical software. MI is more complex, however, and \nsome statistical software packages provide inbuilt procedures. The statistical software \npackage STATA undertakes MI by chained equations using the ICE command [20]. \nThe software package SAS uses the multiple imputation procedure (PROC MI) to \ncarry out the imputation followed by PROC MIANALYZE to combine the results \n[19]. The package, SOLAS (Statistical Solutions Inc, Sargus, MA, USA) has been \ndeveloped to handle missing data and perform MI. The work presented here used SAS \nand full technical details of these imputation procedures can be found in the SAS \nUser\u2019s Guide [19]. \n \nRepeated measures model \nQoL data collected in trials is often analysed using an analysis of covariance \n(ANCOVA) on the final endpoint.  Since longitudinal data has been collected an \nalternative is the repeated measures model [1,21]. This type of model assumes the \ndata are MAR. It has several advantages over the simpler ANCOVA.  It takes into \naccount correlations between the repeated measures and allows for missing data [21].  \n  \nThe models are fitted using restricted maximum likelihood estimation, using for \nexample the MIXED procedure in SAS [19].  \n \nPattern mixture model \nPattern mixture models allow for different response models for each pattern of \nmissing values [1,22]. The data are then a mixture of these weighted by the \nprobability of each missing value or dropout pattern. To apply a pattern mixture \nmodel, the proportion of subjects for each pattern of missing data needs to be known. \nHowever, there can be a large number of potential patterns of missing data, causing \ndifficulties in estimating all the model parameters in each pattern. Furthermore, for \nsome patterns the model can be under identified, and not all the parameters can be \nestimated without additional assumptions or restrictions placed on the model [22]. \nThree possible restrictions for monotone missingness have been proposed: complete \ncase missing value (CCMV); available case missing value (ACMV); neighbouring \ncase missing value (NCMV) [1,15,22]. \n \nIn summary under the CCMV restriction, the data from subjects in pattern one \n(complete cases) are used to impute the means for the missing observations in the \nremaining patterns. It is important to note that this restriction is only feasible when the \nnumber of cases in pattern one is sufficient to estimate these parameters reliably.  In \nthe ACMV restriction, available data from subjects in all patterns are used to impute \nthe means for the missing observations in the remaining patterns. This is less \nrestrictive than CCMV restriction as more observations are used to estimate some \nparameters. Finally, for the NCMV restriction available data from subjects in the \nneighbouring pattern are used to impute the means for the missing observations in the \n  \nremaining patterns. These three sets of restrictions result in a number of equations that \nneed to be solved to obtain the unknown means and variance parameters. However, \nderiving the appropriate variance of the pooled estimates is complex. Curran [23] \nsuggests an analytic technique using MI to avoid this problem and this has been \nimplemented here.  \n \nDatasets \nThe datasets involved in this empirical work come from the Centre for Healthcare \nRandomised Trials in Aberdeen and include the physical and mental summary \ncomponents of the SF36 [24] and the EuroQoL EQ5D score [25]. Data were collected \nat baseline (at a clinic appointment) with subsequent follow-up through postal \nquestionnaires. To reduce the number of unreturned follow-up questionnaires, one or \nmore reminders were issued to those who did not respond within a specified time \n(usually two weeks). This recovered a substantial portion of otherwise missing data.  \n \nFive randomised trials are presented. Several quality of life instruments were \nadministered in the trials, but only the EQ5D results are presented in detail. \n1. REFLUX (N=357) evaluated the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of \nearly laparoscopic surgery compared with continued medical management \namongst people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. QoL data (EQ5D, SF12 \nand gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms) were collected at baseline, three months \nand twelve months after surgery (or equivalent for those managed medically). \nTrial analysis consisted of ANCOVA of the 12 month treatment difference \n(surgical versus medical management) adjusting for baseline QoL and a number \nof other baseline characteristics (age, sex and body mass index (BMI)) [26]. \n  \n2. MAVIS (N=910) was a randomised controlled trial of multi-vitamin and mineral \nsupplementation in persons aged 65 and over to reduce infection rates and \nantibiotic usage. QoL data (EQ5D and SF12) were collected at baseline, six and \ntwelve months follow-up. ANCOVA was used to estimate the mean difference at \n12 months between groups (placebo versus supplementation) after adjusting for \nbaseline QoL values and the baseline covariates - age group, sex and type of \nhousing [27].  \n3. RECORD (N=5292) was a placebo-controlled trial of daily oral vitamin D and \ncalcium supplementation in the secondary prevention of osteoporosis related \nfractures in older people. QoL was assessed at 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months using \nthe EQ5D and the SF12 instruments. An ANCOVA adjusting for baseline QoL, \nage group, gender, time since recruiting fracture and type of fracture was carried \nout to assess treatment effects on QoL at 24 months. The calcium supplementation \n(or no supplementation) treatment comparison will be used for illustration [28]. \n4. KAT aimed to measure the long-term clinical and cost effectiveness of different \ntypes of knee replacement. There were 1517 patients randomised between patella \nresurfacing or not. Functional status (Oxford Knee Score) and quality of life \n(SF12 and EQ5D) were measured at baseline, three months and annually after \ntheir operation. An ANCOVA for the two-year treatment comparison adjusting for \nbaseline QoL, age group, sex and extent of arthritis was carried out [29]. \n5. PRISM (N=1324) evaluated the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of \nsymptomatic versus intensive bisphosphonate therapy for the management of \nPaget\u2019s disease. QoL was assessed through yearly postal questionnaires including \nthe EQ5D, SF36 and disease-specific QoL as measured by the Arthritis Specific \nHealth Index. The primary endpoint in the PRISM trial was treatment effect at two \n  \nyears adjusting for baseline QoL, and a number of Paget\u2019s disease-related \nvariables [30]. \n \nThe missingness mechanism in our studies was found to be a mixture of MCAR, \nmissing at random (MAR) and possible MNAR [3]. Knowing this mechanism is \nimportant in determining which of the methods considered here are likely to provide \nthe least biased results.   \n \nMethods \nIn this paper we use an empirical approach to compare the different strategies for \ndealing with missing data. The approach outlined in this paper differs from previous \nliterature in that it is based on real data from trials in which initially missing data was \nlater recovered using a reminder system. This paper deals with missing forms, so \nimputation is carried out on complete QoL dimensions rather than individual items \ncomprising the dimension. It is only the data from the questionnaires that were \nobtained by reminder that are imputed and the not the data from the questionnaires \nthat were never obtained. The data collected by reminder are initially regarded as \nmissing, as if no reminder system had been used. This portion of data is then imputed \nand results from analyses of the trial compared to what was actually obtained when \nusing all responders (including the reminder data). The impact of the imputation \nmethod on estimation of treatment difference is evaluated and the different strategies \ncompared. \n \nFor each trial dataset, the relevant covariates for imputation were identified using \nstandard statistical procedures (e.g. t-tests and chi-squared tests) to identify those that \n  \nwere significantly associated with both the outcome (QoL) and the indicator of \nreminder response.  Two imputation models were then used. Firstly a model including \nonly covariates (involved in the original trial analysis plus any additional variables \nrelated to missingness and outcome) and secondly the same covariates plus previous \nQoL.  \n \nA repeated measures model was carried out for each trial. The baseline assessment \nwas used as a covariate rather than incorporated into the repeated measures. The \nmodel also adjusted for the same covariates that were used in the original trial \nANCOVA.  This allowed the treatment difference estimates to be more comparable to \nthe original analysis carried out by the trial researchers. \nDetermining the best method \nFor each dataset, the calculated treatment difference and its corresponding 95% \nconfidence interval were obtained for the observed data, data under simple \nimputation, under MI, from the repeated measure model and from the pattern mixture \nmodels. The absolute bias in the calculated treatment effect was calculated. The full \nrange of results is provided for the EQ5D QoL score and brief details given for the \nSF12 summary scores.  \nSecondly the precision of the estimate is important when determining accuracy of the \ndifferent methods. The width of the confidence interval for the observed result and \nthat under the imputation\/modelling strategies was obtained. The ratio of this width \nwas calculated. Ideally the ratio would be equal to one such that the observed \nprecision was also seen in the imputation. The \u2018best\u2019 method was identified as the \nmethod which showed the smallest bias, but also took into account the precision. In an \n  \nideal world a \u2018perfect imputation\u2019 would result in an estimate with no bias and \nvariance equal to variance in the observed data and it is against this standard that the \nratio of CI width was assessed.  \n \nResults \nTable 1 shows the percentage of each type of responder from the total sample size \n(immediate, reminder or non-responder) at each assessment for each trial. It is seen \nthat MAVIS had an excellent response rate to the initial mailing, while in REFLUX a \nlarge amount of data were recovered through the reminder responses. \n \nIn each trial analysis an ANCOVA model for treatment difference in QoL scores at \nthe final endpoint adjusting for other covariates was carried out. This final endpoint \nwas at one year follow-up for REFLUX and MAVIS, but at two years for RECORD, \nKAT and PRISM. The proportion of missing responses (or reminder-response here \nthat will be imputed) from the total number of responders at these final endpoints was: \nREFLUX \u2013 57%; MAVIS \u2013 12%; RECORD \u2013 22%, KAT \u2013 18%; PRISM \u2013 18%. \nTable 2 shows the covariates for each trial that were identified as being significant in \nthe models for simple regression imputation and those involved in the MI procedures. \nTable 3 shows the observed treatment difference (95% CI) in EQ5D scores. The \n\u2018absolute bias*100\u2019 and \u2018ratio of the CI width\u2019 are presented in Table 3 for each of the \nimputation and modelling methods. The results under simple imputation, multiple \nimputation and the alternative procedures are discussed in turn. This is followed by a \ncomparison between these different options for dealing with missing data. \n \n  \nSimple imputation \nThe choice of simple imputation method can have an impact on whether the \ncalculated treatment difference is significant. For example in the REFLUX trial the \nmethods of BCF, LOCF and regression all provide a significant treatment difference \n(p<0.05). In the REFLUX and MAVIS trials the baseline carried forward (BCF) \nmethod provided the smallest total bias of the simple imputation procedures \nconsidered. The precision based on the ratio of CI width was equal to one in MAVIS \nusing BCF, but in REFLUX this ideal value occurred with LOCF. In RECORD and \nKAT, LOCF provided the least biased estimates of treatment difference (bias = 0.2 \nand bias = 0. 4 respectively) and for RECORD the ratio of CI width was equal to one. \nMean imputation and regression imputation tended to provide most bias. In the \nPRISM trial the maximum method showed least bias (bias = 0.4) compared to 1.0 for \nthe BCF method. However, BCF was much better at maintaining precision as the ratio \nof CI width was one. \n \nThere were 13 other QoL scores measured across the five trials in addition to EQ5D. \nLOCF was the most accurate (least biased) in five of these. BCF showed least bias on \nfour occasions, mean value imputation for three QoL scores and finally maximum \nvalue imputation for one instrument. Combining these results with the EQ5D data \nshows that the longitudinal simple imputation methods (BCF and LOCF) provided the \ngreatest number of \u2018best\u2019 (least biased) estimates (13 of 18 QoL scores).    \nMultiple imputation \nAs with simple imputation the choice of MI had an impact on the calculated estimates \nof treatment difference.  MCMC imputation was carried out on all the missing data as \nit allows for the intermittent missing data pattern. For the regression, predictive mean \n  \nmatch and propensity score methods, MCMC was first used to make the data \nmonotone.  The predictive mean match model was the least biased method for four of \nthe five trials (REFLUX, MAVIS, RECORD and PRISM). MCMC for intermittent \nmissingness showed an equivalently small bias as the predictive mean match for the \nRECORD trial. In KAT, the regression model (including previous QoL scores) \nresulted in least bias. The ratio of CI width was reasonable (equal to or close to one) \nfor the predictive man match model in each of the trials.   \n \nMI for the other 13 QoL scores within the trials showed that MCMC for intermittent \nmissingness was least biased for four of them, as was the predictive mean match \nmodel. A propensity model was least biased on three occasions and finally regression \nwas the least biased MI method for only two of the twelve QoL scores. \nOther strategies \nPattern mixture models (incorporating MI) did not perform that well for REFLUX or \nKAT data in terms of bias. In the MAVIS trial under CCMV the calculated treatment \nestimate showed a much greater bias than the other two restrictions and the ratio of CI \nwidth was much larger than one. Across all trials, of the three restrictions it was either \nACMV or NCMV which performed best with NCMV tending to provide the better \nprecision. The estimates obtained using a repeated measures model were more \naccurate than pattern mixture modelling for the REFLUX, MAVIS, RECORD and \nKAT trials. Pattern mixture models appeared to perform better for PRISM in terms of \nbias, although the precision was reasonable in both cases. However one note of \ncaution is that the results for the pattern mixture models are based on only those \npatients with a monotone missingness pattern.   \n  \nComparison between the different approaches for dealing with missing data \nThe paragraphs above have discussed in turn the results of the simple imputation, MI, \nrepeated measures model and pattern mixture models. Table 3 shows the calculated \nbias (bias*100) for each of these strategies for the EQ5D score in the five different \ntrials. In four of the five trials, one of the MI strategies showed the least bias. In the \nfifth a pattern mixture model on the monotone missing data (using NCMV, bias = 0.1) \nwas least biased but this was closely followed by two of the MI procedures (bias = \n0.2) carried out on all the missing data. The most accurate MI strategy was the \npredictive mean match model.  On the whole it was one of the MI strategies which \nprovided the best precision \u2013 that is, the ratio of the CI width was either equal or close \nto one. In these five trials MI consistently provided results with low bias and best \nprecision. \nDiscussion \nIt has been shown in this paper that different imputation strategies can impact on the \neventual calculated treatment estimates to varying degrees. Generally the longitudinal \nmethods (BCF and LOCF) were the \u2018best\u2019 simple imputation methods. MCMC \nimputation to make the data monotone followed by a predictive mean match model \nwas good and the best MI method for the EQ5D scores in four of the trials. Usually \none of the MI procedures provided least biased results and the most precise. This was \ntrue for the data presented and for the other QoL measures used within the five trials. \nThe ratio of CI width was close to one and the standard errors tended to reflect those \ncalculated in the observed dataset. This is important when calculating the confidence \nintervals and p-values for significance [14]. The MI strategies seemed preferable to \nthe other procedures considered. \n \n  \nThe REFLUX trial contained the most missing data (and correspondingly, the greatest \namount of data collected via reminder-response). MCMC to make the data monotone \nfollowed by a predictive mean match model was clearly more superior over the \nsimple imputation methods. Pattern mixture models for this dataset performed \nparticularly badly when compared to the standard MI models or the repeated measures \nmodel. The difference between simple and MI is less obvious as the amount of data \nbeing imputed is reduced. For example, in the MAVIS trial only 12% of data is \nundergoing imputation and in this trial one of each of the simple and MI methods \nwere equivalent in providing the smallest bias.  \n \nPrevious work has shown evidence against MCAR for the five datasets [3]. Therefore, \nit would be unlikely that simple imputation would be appropriate, whereas MI might \nbe more suitable. The simple imputation methods assume that data are MCAR \u2013\nunrelated to anything observed. MI methods assume MAR and that missing data are \nrelated to observed data (covariates and\/or outcome) [1]. If there is no evidence for \nMCAR then simple imputation methods should be used with caution or not at all.  It is \nlikely that QoL data is frequently missing for a reason related to changing QoL and so \nMI should be preferable because MAR is more plausible. The CCMV restriction for \nthe pattern mixture model assumes MCAR and therefore not surprisingly this \nperforms worst of the three restrictions. ACMV and NCMV are based on the MAR \nassumption which as we have already discussed is more plausible in this context.  The \npattern mixture models were carried out on a reduced dataset which only contained \nthose patients with a monotone missing data pattern. This may account for the \ndifferences seen between ACMV\/NCMV and the MI models. \n  \nMolenberghs and Kenward [14] discuss the merits of the different MI approaches. \nThey promote the use of a regression or predictive mean match model for the \nlongitudinal setting. An advantage of a predictive mean match model over regression \nis that imputed values are always within the range of the data [1]. In situations of \nmonotone missingness, it is expected that the MCMC approach and the regression \nmethod should lead to similar answers. Any difference is due largely to the different \nprior distribution used [14]. Regression and predictive mean match imputation have \nbeen shown to be the most accurate in this current situation, with the propensity score \nmodel on the whole performing poorly in comparison. A reason for this is given by \nMolenberghs and Kenward [14] (page 144): \n \u201cThe propensity score method uses only the covariate information \nassociated with whether the imputed values are missing. It does not use \nassociations among variables; As a consequence, while it can be effective \nfor inferences about the distributions of individual imputed variables, it is \nnot appropriate for analyses involving relationships among variables.\u201d \n[14]  \n \nIf the model used for analysis and the imputation model are the same, the \nresulting estimates under imputation will be equivalent to those obtained by \nmaximum likelihood, for example using a repeated measure design [17]. \nHowever, when the imputation model uses covariate information which is \npotentially related to the missing QoL values, the estimates may be different.  \n \nThere is increasing evidence from simulation studies that MI provides more \nrobust treatment estimates and appropriate standard errors [4-12]. Each of these \n  \nauthors has compared MI to a simpler alternative or complete case strategy. In \nsome situations MI was shown to perform at least as well in terms of treatment \neffects but on the whole provided a more realistic standard error. Our study \ncomplements these studies using real data with reminders rather than simulated \nmissing data.  \n \nOne note of caution of the use of imputation is with regard to its validity when \nthere is a large proportion of missing data. For example, the proportion of data \nobtained through reminders for REFLUX was 57% and to impute this much \ndata should be done so with caution. Imputation is often regarded as a tool to \nassess sensitivity of results to missing data rather than a primary analysis \n[1,4,31]. The methods presented here could be used to identify which methods \nwould be most appropriate.  One limitation of the current work is that we have \nnot considered the impact of the different strategies on the eventual trial result. \nThis is an important consideration and is addressed in a future paper. \n \nA second limitation was the use of the criteria of the ratio of CI width being \nequal to one as a proxy for precision of the imputation procedure. A perfect \nimputation procedure would result in the variance of the imputed estimate being \nequal to the variance of the full data estimate and the ratio equal to one.  \nHowever, in practice it might be that the value of one was obtained due to a bias \nin the imputed estimate and thus it is possible that a value of one does not \nsuggest an optimal imputation. In situations where there is a large amount of \nmissing data, the variance is likely to be underestimated and the criteria of the \nratio of CI width has less standing. However, since it is unlikely imputation \n  \nwould be used in these situations anyway, despite the concern, we felt that using \nthis ratio of CI width as a measure of precision was a fair assumption to make. \n \n \nThe rationale underlying our approach is that the \u2018reminder-responders\u2019 are \nlikely to be representative of those who do not respond at all.  Thus we were \nable to identify possible suitable imputation methods or an appropriate \nmodelling alternative. This method could then be used on the actual missing \ndata to allow more patients (and data) to be included in the final analysis.  \nAlthough it can never be proved that they are representative, it was found that \nthe mechanism behind reminder-response was usually the same as the \nmechanism behind non-response for each of these trials [3].  This suggests that \nthe rationale behind the approach presented in this paper is valid. However since \nthe data required to prove this are missing, the strategies outlined should be \nused as a sensitivity to results rather than a primary analysis [17]. \nConclusion \nAs Huson et al. [7] observe there is no one imputation technique that is applicable for \nall possible missing data patterns and missing data mechanisms. However, here we \nhave shown that MI was more suitable then both simple imputation methods and \nrepeated measures models when missing data was found to be informative. MI models \nthe uncertainty in the missing data and is based on the MAR assumption, which is \nmore plausible in the QoL setting. When deciding on the best model for imputation it \nis recommended that all the variables in the analysis model are included plus any \nadditional variables which are related to both outcome and missingness. MI is the \nhard way to analyze data where missingness is MAR and will only provide a benefit \n  \nwhen the analyst has additional information that is related to QoL both when the \nresponse is observed and when it is missing [1]. We suggest that where possible \nreminder data should always be collected and can be used to identify suitable \nimputation procedures. This \u2018best\u2019 choice can then be used on the actual missing data \nto allow more patients to be included in analysis.  \n \nAbbreviations \n \nACMA \u2013 available case missing value; ANCOVA \u2013 analysis of covariance; BCF \u2013 \nbaseline carried forwards; BMI \u2013 body mass index; CCMV \u2013 complete case missing \nvalue; CI \u2013 confidence interval; EQ5D \u2013 EuroQoL EQ5D; ICE \u2013 imputation by \nchained equations; KAT \u2013 Knee Arthroplasty Trial LOCF \u2013 Last observation carried \nforward; MAR \u2013 missing at random; MAVIS \u2013 Randomised trial of mineral and \nvitamin supplementation; MCAR \u2013 missing completely at random; MCMC- Markov \nChain Monte Carlo; MI \u2013 multiple imputation; MNAR \u2013 missing not at random; \nNCMV - neighbouring case missing value; NVCB \u2013 next value carried backwards; \nPRISM \u2013 Paget\u2019s disease: a Randomised trial of Intensive versus Symptomatic \nManagement; RECORD \u2013 Randomised Evaluation of Calcium and\/OR vitamin D; \nREFLUX- Randomised Evaluation oF Laproscopic sUrgery for reflux; SF12\/36 \u2013 \nShort Form 12 or Short Form 36; QoL \u2013 Quality of life; RCT \u2013 Randomised \ncontrolled trial. \n \nAcknowledgments \nWe would like to thank the Centre for HealthCare Randomised Trials based within \nthe Health Services Research Unit and their staff for providing the data used for this \nwork.
