The \ntraveltime and amplitude of PS converted waves may be different in the forward and reverse \nshooting directions, giving rise to different stacking velocities of PS converted waves and \nvelocity ratios. These effects, compounded with the asymmetric raypath of PS converted \nwaves, will further increase the difficulties and costs in processing PS converted wave data. \nOne common method to solve this problem is to separate a dataset into two volumes with \ndifferent shooting directions (e.g. negative or positive offset directions).

In this \npaper, we propose a method to overcome this problem and apply this method to a 2D dataset \nfor improving the PS converted wave imaging.  \n \nThe diodic moveout of PS converted waves. In homogeneous media the moveout of PS \nconverted waves is written as: \n \n][\n2\n2\n4\n22\n0\n2\n4\n2\n2\n2\n0\n2\nhmVtV\nh\nV\nhtt\npsps\neff\nps\npsps \u22c5+\n\u2212+=\n\u03ba\n,                                         (1) \n \n2\n0\n0\n2\n0\n)1(8\n)1(8)1(\neff\neffeff\neff \u03b3\u03b3\n\u03b3\u03c7\u03b3\u03b3\n\u03ba\n+\n++\u2212\n= ,                                               (2) \n \n \n2\/16 \n \n \n \neffeffeff\neffeff\neffm \u03c7\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\n\u03c7\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\n\u03ba\n)1(2)1()1(\n]2)1)[(1(\n2\n000\n2\n00\n4 ++\u2212\u2212\n+\u2212+\n= ,                                  (3) \nwhere psV  is the velocity of PS converted waves which is a combination of P- and S-wave \nvelocities, 0\u03b3  and eff\u03b3  vertical and effective sp VV \/  ratios, eff\u03c7  the anisotropic parameter \nfor PS converted waves, 0pst  the vertical two-way travel time, h  the shot-receiver offset. \nFor homogeneous media, the PS converted wave moveout is invariant when source and \nreceiver positions are interchanged. However, in lateral inhomogeneous media, PS converted \nwave moveout and velocity are not invariant under an interchange of source and receiver \npositions. This phenomenon is called diodic velocity, a term referring to the electronic diode, \nwhich operates differently in forward and reverse directions. This phenomenon is caused by \nthe asymmetric ray-path of PS converted waves which propagates in inhomogeneous media. \nFigure 1 schematically shows this phenomenon in which the media is uniform except for a \nzone of anomalous P and S velocities. For a given conversion point associated with the same \noffset length, the PS converted wave has different ray-paths when the source and receiver \npositions are changed and hence the velocities along the ray-paths are different. The two ray-\npaths involve different P- and S-wave velocities. Hence the converted wave velocity and \nvelocity ratio are different for the two ray-paths, and so the moveouts for the two ray-paths \nare different. The different moveouts increase the difficulty on processing PS converted wave \ndata. \n In PS converted wave data processing, the events should be flattened using Equation \n(1). However, due to the diodic effect, using one velocity model cannot flatten the events for \nthe two datasets with opposite offset directions.  \n \n \n3\/16 \n \n The diodic effect also exists in prestack time migration processing. In prestack time \nmigration, the travel time is the summation of the travel-time of the down-going P-wave and \nup-going S-wave. \n spps ttt +=                                                                (4) \nwhere pt  and st  are approximated as: \n \n])21([\n2\n1\n1\n22\n0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n0\n0 peffpspsps\npeff\nps\np\npsp wVtV\nw\nV\nw\ntt\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u03b3 ++\n\u2212+\n+\n=                        (5) \n \n][\n2\n1 22 0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\nspspsps\nseff\nps\ns\npss wVtV\nw\nV\nwtt\n+\n\u2212+\n+\n=\n\u03be\n\u03b3\n\u03b3                                        (6) \nWhere \neff\neffp\np\nx\nw\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u03b3 )1)(1( 0\n2 ++\n= , \n0\n0\n2 )1)(1(\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u03b3 effs\ns\nx\nw\n++\n= , 2\n0 )1( e f f\ne f f \u03b3\u03b3\n\u03c7\u03b7\n\u2212\n=  and \n10 \u2212\n\u2212=\n\u03b3\n\u03c7\u03bee f f . px  is the distance from the shot to image point, sx  the distance from image \npoint to receiver. Similar to stacking processing, for a common image point, when the \npositions of source and receiver are changed, the ray paths are different and involve different \nvelocities. Due to the diodic effect, the events in the common image point gather cannot be \nflattened using one velocity model for the two datasets with opposite offset directions.  \n To overcome this problem, two velocity models should be used. One model is used for \nthe positive offset data and the other is used for the negative offset data. Conventionally, the \ndataset is separated into two volumes according to the offset direction. Each volume is \nprocessed using its own velocity model. However, there are some drawbacks which prevent \nthis method being applied to real datasets. One of the drawbacks is that it is difficult to align \nthe events when the two datasets are separately processed, especially when the signal-to-\n \n \n4\/16 \n \n \nnoise ratio is low or many events need to be aligned. Therefore, when the two poorly aligned \ndatasets are combined, the final results are degraded. It is necessary to overcome this \ndrawback. One solution is to process the two datasets in one interface, but using two velocity \nmodels for the opposite offset directions. \n \nThe perturbation of the velocity of PS converted waves. The velocity model of PS \nconverted waves has four parameters ( psV , 0\u03b3 , eff\u03b3  and eff\u03c7 ).  psV , eff\u03b3  and eff\u03c7  might \nhave different values in the two models. Thus seven parameters will need to be estimated. \nThis is not practical because the uncertainty and workload are very large. Fortunately, the \nparameters in PS converted wave velocity model have different sensitivities to moveout. The \nerror in the moveout is mainly determined by the PS converted wave velocity, psV . Other \nparameters have less effect on the moveout. This means we may need two velocities, but \nother parameters can be unchanged for the opposite offset data. We also find that in practice, \nwe can express the two velocities as a base velocity and a perturbation: \n )1( \u2206+=+ psops VV                                                               (7) \n )1( \u2206\u2212=\u2212 psops VV                                                               (8) \nwhere psV  is the base velocity defined as the velocity without diodic effects, and \u2206  is the \nvelocity perturbation (as a percentage).  \n Figure 2 schematically shows how to apply two velocities to correct a diodic moveout. \nIf only the base velocity is used to correct the event, the corrected event becomes a dipping \nstraight line and the resulting stacked event will smear. When we add the velocity \nperturbation, the corrected event becomes a horizontal line and the resulting stacked event \n \n \n5\/16 \n \nwill be better resolved. The advantage of this perturbation method is that it can decouple the \ndiodic moveout into two parts. One part is related to the base velocity and one part is related \nto the perturbation. The base velocity is used to correct the curved part of the events and the \nperturbation is used to correct the dipping part of the events. Following the above analysis, \nwe developed tools to perform the diodic velocity analysis and apply the diodic velocity to \ncorrect the diodic moveout. We will discuss the tools in the following section.  \n In prestack time migration, we use a similar perturbation method to deal with the diodic \ntravel-times. The two velocities for opposite offset directions are also expressed as Equations \n(7) and (8).  Note that in prestack time migration, an asymmetric travel time may be caused \nby incorrect values of the effective velocity ratio. However, if we assume that the values of \nthe effective velocity ratio in prestack time migration are equal to the values in the moveout, \nand also that the effect of the effective velocity ratio and anisotropy on travel time is smaller \nthan the velocity, we do not need to add a perturbation to the effective velocity ratio and \nanisotropy. We also developed a GUI tool for migration velocity analysis, and a prestack time \nmigration tool to compensate the diodic moveout in prestack time migration.  \n \nData example. We applied the tools to a dataset which is from a 2D\/4C marine acquisition \nfrom a field located approximately 60km offshore North Africa. This area is partially \nobscured by a gas chimney that causes heavy distortion. There is an outer seabed collapse \nzone with an inner elevated, hard ground feature which leads to the channel being obscured. \nThe gas in the media attenuates the P-wave energy and reduces the P-wave velocity. \nHowever, it has a small effect on shear-wave velocity. The inhomogeneity caused by the gas \nresults in the diodic moveout. Without a suitable method to compensate for the diodic effect, \n \n \n6\/16 \n \n \nthe image obtained from this dataset will be degraded.  Here we apply our tools to the \ndataset to deal with the diodic movout. \n This perturbation approach is firstly applied to the NMO+stacking procedure. Figures 3 \nand 4 show snapshots of the velocity analysis tool which performs the diodic velocity \nanalysis. In both figures, the first left panel shows the PS converted wave velocity, the second \nshows the velocity ratio, the third shows the anisotropy and the fourth shows the velocity \nperturbation. The furthest right is the gather panel. Without the perturbation, the events \nbecome dipping after the NMO correction using the base velocity only (Fig 3). With the \nperturbation considered, the events became horizontal (Fig 4). Stacking the horizontal events \nyield a more focused imaging than stacking the dipping events.  Figure 5 and 6 show a \ncomparison between the images with and without velocity perturbation. Figure 5 shows the \nsallow part of the images between 2s and 4 s. Two images have similar structures but the \nevents obtained with velocity perturbation applied are clearer and have stronger energies. \nFigure 6 shows the deep part of the image between 5.5s and 7.5s. Although the main features \na similar, the structures are different. The events obtained with velocity perturbation applied \nhave stronger energies. \n We also apply this perturbation approach to prestack Kirchhoff time migration. Figure 7 \nand 8 show snapshots of the migration velocity tool to perform the diodic effect analysis. In \nFigure 7, without the velocity perturbation, the events are dipping, similar to those in Figure \n3. In Figure 8, with the velocity perturbation, the events become horizontal. Stacking the \nhorizontal events will yield a more focused imaging than stacking the dipping events. \n Figure 9 and 10 show the parts of final migrated images with and without velocity \nperturbation. Figure 9 shows the sallow part of the migrated images between 2s and 4s. Two \n \n \n7\/16 \n \nimages have similar structure; however the images with velocity perturbation are clearer and \nhave larger contrast. Figure 10 shows the deep part of the migrated image between 5.5 and \n7.5s. The improvement in the image with velocity perturbation is obvious. For example, the \nimage obtained with velocity perturbation has larger contrast than that without velocity \nperturbation. Note that the appearances of the structure of the two images are different. \nEvents in Figure 10a are dipping and those in Figure 10b are horizontal. \n \nDiscussions. From the above processed results, we find that the velocity perturbation method \ncan improve the quality of the image in both NMO+stacking and prestack time migration \nprocedures. However, we must note that this improvement is obtained from compensating \ndiodic moveout only.  In the NMO+stacking procedure, because the velocity perturbation is \napplied after asymptotic conversion-point binning, it does not affect the location of the \nconversion point of PS converted waves. However, in prestack time migration, the velocity \nperturbation method does have an effect on the location of scatter point of PS converted \nwaves. If we compare the stacking sections (Figures 5 and 9) and migration images (Figures \n6 and 10), we can see significant differences between the two results. The reason is that in \nstacking processing, the asymptotic conversion point binning procedure cannot accurately \nlocate the conversion points, but the prestack migration can accurately locate the image point. \nThe quality of the migrated image improved more than the quality of the stacked \nsections.  The velocity perturbation has larger effect in prestack time migration. For \nexample, the events are more continues and clearer in Figure 10 (b) than in Figure 10 (a).\n  \n   \n \n \n8\/16 \n \n \nConclusions. We have proposed a practical approach to compensate the diodic moveout of \nPS converted waves using a velocity perturbation method. GUI tools have been developed to \nperform the diodic velocity analysis for stacking procedure and prestack time migration, and \ncommand line tools perform the diodic moveout correction and prestack time migration with \ndiodic moveout compensation. In this method, the diodic moveout is decoupled into two \nparts. One part is related to the base velocity and the other part is related to the velocity \nperturbation. The base velocity is used to correct the curved feature of the diodic moveout \nand the velocity perturbation is used to correct the dipping feature of the diodic moveout. \nApplication of these tools to a real dataset has shown that we can easily estimate the base \nvelocity and the velocity perturbation. The events in negative and positive offset data can be \neasily aligned, and the quality of both the final stacked image and migrated image are \nimproved.  \n \nSuggested reading. \u201cA simplified moveout formula for P-, S- and converted\u2013waves in multi-\nlayered media\u201d by Dai and Li.
