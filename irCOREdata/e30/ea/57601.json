Percent arsenic bioaccessibility and total arsenic concentration of samples \ncollected in 2005 in Nova Scotia. The data illustrated in this figure is presented in Table 1 \n(main document). Results are for the < 150 \u00b5m particle size fraction. The percent arsenic \nbioaccessibility is chosen as the higher of either P1 (gastric phase) or P2 (gastric + intestinal \nphase), and is calculated as 100 \u2022 bioaccessible arsenic concentration \u2022 (total arsenic \nconcentration)-1.  \n   S6 \n \nEffect of Selected Particle Size. Bioaccessibility results may be affected by particle size, making \nthe choice of particle size important in estimating arsenic bioaccessibility (9, 16).  \n \nLimited sample material from the 2005 collection (described in the main document) precluded its \nuse in a particle size study. Instead, samples were selected from a 2006 collection (3). The 2006 \nsample set (n = 27) was assembled following a similar collection pattern as the samples collected \nin 2005 at the Goldenville and Montague sites. Nine samples (four from Goldenville and five \nfrom Montague) were selected for the particle size study, representing a range of arsenic \nconcentrations and bioaccessibilities (Table S1). The requirement to sieve the bulk material to \nthree particle size fractions (resulting in small subsample sizes) limited this series of \nbioaccessibility tests to the gastric phase (P1) only.  \n \nThe extraction procedures used in the particle size study are the same as described in the main \ndocument, and the quality controls (9 duplicates, 6 blanks, 6 standard reference materials) met \nthe criteria described in Table S2. For this series of tests, the relative percent difference (RPD) \nbetween duplicates ranged from 0.59 to 4.9% (average 4.3%). The percent arsenic \nbioaccessibility results were calculated with respect to total arsenic concentrations measured in \neach particle size fraction (Figure S2).  \n \n \n   S7 \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nGD62 GD67 GD61 GD65 MG614MG68 MG67 MG64 MG62\npe\nrc\nen\nt a\nrs\nen\nic\n b\nio\nac\nce\nss\nib\nili\nty\nsamples in increasing order of bulk arsenic concentration\n<250 \u00b5m\n<150 \u00b5m\n<45 \u00b5m\n0\n20000\n40000\n60000\n80000\n100000\nGD62 GD67 GD61 GD65 MG614MG68 MG67 MG64 MG62t\not\nal\n a\nrs\nen\nic\n c\non\nce\nnt\nra\ntio\nn \nsamples in increasing order of bulk arsenic concentration\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nGD62 GD67 GD61 GD65 MG614MG68 MG67 MG64 MG62\nbi\noa\ncc\nes\nsib\nle\n a\nrs\nen\nic\n c\non\nce\nnt\nra\ntio\nn \n \nsamples in increasing order of bulk arsenic concentration\n(m\ng\u2022\nkg\n-1\n) \n(m\ng\u2022\nkg\n-1\n) \nA\nB\nC\n \nFigure S2. Bioaccessibility and concentration of arsenic in different particle size fractions. \nThe percent arsenic bioaccessibility (Panel A), total arsenic concentration (Panel B), and \nbioaccessible arsenic concentration (Panel C) are shown for selected 2006 samples sieved to \nthree particle size fractions (< 250 \uf06dm, < 150 \uf06dm and < 45 \uf06dm) tested by PBET in the \ngastric phase (P1) only. Error bars (\u00b1 4.3% for the bioaccessibility tests, and 5.0% for the \ntotal arsenic concentrations) represent the average of the relative percent difference \nbetween duplicates for this series of tests.  \n   S8 \nPrincipal Components Analysis (PCA). Bulk major and trace element concentrations (Ag, Al, \nAs, Au, Ba, Bi, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hg, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, S, \nSb, Se, Sn, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, V, W, Y, Zn and Zr), inorganic (IC) and organic carbon (OC) \nconcentrations, and arsenic bioaccessibility results (BiAc) obtained for the 29 samples collected \nin 2005 (for the < 150 \u03bcm particle size fraction) were placed in a 42\u00d729 matrix. The PCA results \nare presented in two related maps (Figure S3: Maps A and B). The factor loadings, shown on \nMap A, express the influence of the original variables on each sample, which are spatially \nrepresented according to factor scores on Map B. SYSTATTM 10 was used to treat mean centered \nand scaled matrices, and each correlation matrix was generated with default Eigenvalues of 1. \n \nThe two first principal components (used to construct Figure S3) account for nearly 60% of the \nvariance. Three main groups of samples were revealed when samples were plotted according to \nfactor scores. Groups were labelled 1, 2 and 3 from top to bottom and generally include samples \nfrom the same location. Group 1 contains all the Montague samples, the Whiteburn sample, and \nfour of the North Brookfield samples (NB11A, 11B, 12 and 13). Group 2 includes the rest of the \nNorth Brookfield samples and all of the Goldenville samples, except for GD1. Group 3 contains \nall of the Caribou samples except CAR2. Sample OLD4 stands outside of Group 1. The relative \nposition of the three groups along the vertical axis may correlate with the loading positions of \nfactors potassium and aluminum, which may reflect the proportion of muscovite (Figure S3, Map \nA) in these samples. With the exception of the two outliers (GD1 and CAR2 discussed below), \nsamples have barium, caesium, rubidium and thallium concentrations (3) that systematically \nincrease from site to site and correspond to the PCA distribution observed. Barium, caesium and \nrubidium are known to be common trace elements in micas. Thallium can also be present as it \n   S9 \nexhibits similar geochemical behaviour to potassium. In addition, the OLD4 sample, which plots \nabove all other samples on the PCA, contains the highest concentrations of barium, caesium, \nrubidium and thallium 3 to 9 times the mean of all samples (excluding GD1 and CAR2). \nTherefore, the geographical trend in the PCA data is likely due to variation in the trace element \nchemistry of mica minerals (e.g. muscovite) from location to location. \n \nSamples CAR2 and GD1 stand apart from the groups and are closer to the arsenic loading \nposition. These contain arsenic in concentrations nearly an order of magnitude higher than the \naverage concentrations: CAR2 (310,000 mg\u2022kg-1, 31 wt%) and GD1 (210,000 mg\u2022kg-1, 21 wt%). \n \nThe division of the North Brookfield samples between Groups 1 and 2 (Figure S3, Map B) may \nbe attributed to different ore treatments used at this location. Samples NB6B, NB6C, NB11A, \nNB11B and NB12 were collected near the former processing plant and contain > 4000 mg\u2022kg-1 \narsenic, although not all of these fall within the same Group (samples NB6B and NB6C are in \nGroup 2, whereas the other three are in Group 1). This suggests that the PCA Groups may \ncorrespond to soil composition based on mining process history as well as the aforementioned \nsimilar geographical location.  \n \nThe arsenic bioaccessibility results were compared with Groups 1, 2 and 3. Although the percent \narsenic bioaccessibility is lower than the average of 13% for Group 3 (from 0.5 to 6.8%), the \nbioaccessibility results fluctuate within each Group. Results vary from 2.5 to 29% for Group 1, \nand from 0.40 to 49% for Group 2. The PCA analysis did not reveal groupings that correlate with \neither the bioaccessibility results or the detailed arsenic mineralogy information described in the \n   S10 \nmain document. For example, the five Montague samples tested display a wide range of arsenic \nmineralogy (as detailed in Table 2, main document), and the percent arsenic bioaccessibility \nvaried from 2.5 to 12%; however, these samples were all found within Group 1 of the PCA \nanalysis (Figure S3, Map B). Overall, no PCA groupings emerged to explain the arsenic \nbioaccessibility results (in terms of percentage or as a concentration) for the samples tested. \n-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1\nFactor 1 (37%)\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\nFa\nct\nor\n 2\n (1\n6%\n)\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nAs\nBi Sb\nAg\nFe\nTe S\nSn\nPb\nNI Au\nCo\nW Cu\nZr\nHg\nMo\nTh\nSe\nTi\nMg\nLi\nLaCe\nV\nGa\nMn\nAl\nP\nCs\nCr\nY\nRb\nK\nNa\nCa\nBiAc\nZn\nIC\nOC\n1\n2\n3\nWhiteburnOldhamNorth BrookfieldMontagueGoldenvilleCaribou\nCAR2\nOLD4\nMG6\nMG4\nNB13\nMG2\nMG1\nWB1\nGD1\nCAR5 CAR1\nCAR3\nCAR4\nMG3\nNB12\nNB11B\nNB11A\nGD5\nA B\nNB10\nBa\nTl\n \nFigure S3: Principal components analysis. Elemental analysis and bioaccessibility tests \nresults (mean centred and scaled) for the < 150 \u03bcm particle size fraction of the 29 samples \nfrom the 2005 collection were used in this principal components analysis. Groups identified \nby the numbers 1, 2 and 3, generally reflect sample location. The percent arsenic \nbioaccessibility varies within each Group: 2.5 to 29% for Group 1; 0.4 to 49% for Group 2; \nand 0.5 to 6.8% for Group 3. Factor loadings are presented in Map A, and factor scores for \neach sample in Map B. The one or two-letter code in Map A corresponds to element names, \nexcept: BiAc = arsenic bioaccessibility; OC = organic carbon; IC = inorganic carbon. \nSample labels in Map B are described in the main document. \n   S11 \n11.860 11.865 11.870 11.875 11.880 11.885 11.890\nN\nor\nm\nal\niz\ned\n A\nbs\nor\nba\nnc\ne\nPhoton Energy (keV)\nK-Arsenate\nYukonite\nScorodite\nCAR1\nCAR5\nGD1\nMG1\nNB1\nNB6A\nNB7\nNB10\nNB12\nOLD4\nWB1\nNB8\nNB6C\nArsenopyrite\nA\ns1-\nA\ns3+\nA\ns5+\n \nFigure S4.
