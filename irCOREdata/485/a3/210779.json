This study assessed survival, morbidity and cost of hospital care over 11 years following a first-ever ICH in the UK. Methods: We used a population-based retrospective inception cohort design using data from the Hospital Record Linkage System in Scotland. Long-term survival, morbidity and treatment provided in hospitals were evaluated in all patients with a first diagnosis of ICH in 1995. A cohort of ischemic stroke (IS) patients was also examined for comparison. Results: A total of 705 patients with ICH and 8,893 with IS were identified. The mean age was 65 years (SD = 17.2) for ICH and 73 years (SD = 11.8) for IS at stroke onset. The acute in-hospital mortality was 45.7 and 30.1% for ICH and IS, 51.2 and 39.9% at 1 year, while 76.0 and 80.4% were dead 11 years later. The cumulative risk of nonfatal or fatal ICH was 8.0, 12.7 and 13.7% at 1, 5 and 10 years, and 7.0, 11.1 and 12.9% for IS in the ICH cohort. The mean cost of initial hospital care was GBP 10,332 (SD = 19,919) for ICH and GBP 9,937 (SD = 15,777) for IS. The mean total costs over 11 years were GBP 18,629 (SD = 29,943) for ICH and GBP 21,505 (SD = 27,190) for IS.
