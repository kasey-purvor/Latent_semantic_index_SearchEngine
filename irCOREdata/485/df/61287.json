Introduction\nRecent research on global climate impacts (IPCC 2007 and\nWarren 2006) has produced extensive catalogues of the\npotential impacts expected for different amounts of global\nwarming. Whilst there is no consensus on the precise amount\nof warming that society ought to consider unacceptable,\nmany scientists and policy-makers have suggested maximum\nwarming targets. For instance, Hansen (2005) suggests that\nwarming should be limited to less than 1 \u25e6C above year\n2000 temperature, corresponding to around 1.7 \u25e6C above pre-\nindustrial levels. The European Union (European Council\n2007) has adopted a target of limiting warming to not\nmore than 2 \u25e6C above pre-industrial levels. Several authors\n(e.g. Wigley et al 1996) have concluded that major greenhouse\ngas emission reductions in the near future will be needed in\norder to avoid realizing such temperature levels. Such cuts\nwill be challenging, both economically and technologically\u2014\nindeed to achieve climate stabilization, such emissions need\nto ultimately approach a very small fraction of current levels\n(e.g. Matthews and Caldeira 2008, House et al 2008). Further,\nthe longer the delay in reducing emissions, the larger the\ncuts expected by future generations to avoid potentially\nunwelcome change (Kallbekken and Rive 2007). However,\nrather than declining, recent global emissions have continued\nto grow and at a significant rate (Raupach et al 2007).\n1748-9326\/09\/014012+09$30.00 \u00a9 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK1\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 4 (2009) 014012 J A Lowe et al\nThis therefore raises the question of whether it is possible\nto temporarily cross potentially \u2018dangerous\u2019 thresholds of\natmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (notably carbon\ndioxide, CO2) or temperature rise before returning quickly to\nlower safer levels in the future. Such an \u2018overshoot\u2019 policy\nmight be deliberate, or may occur if society is unable to reduce\nemissions quickly enough to prevent a desired temperature\ntarget from being exceeded. The implication is that once at\nthese high levels of change, society would then act to return to\nlower temperature levels back below this target (Huntingford\nand Lowe 2007).\nSchneider and Mastrandrea (2005) were amongst the\nfirst authors to explicitly consider scenarios which involve\nprescribing a climate change trajectory that crosses a\npotentially dangerous threshold before reverting back to a\nlower safer level. They do this by prescribing \u2018overshoot\u2019\nscenarios in radiative forcing (thus representing altered levels\nof atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations), and then using\na simple model to translate this into temperature change.\nHowever, they did not derive the associated emissions and\nthe constraints that the natural elements of the Earth system\nplaces on reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and\nso this raises the issue of scenario feasibility. O\u2019Neill\nand Oppenheimer (2004), using a simple climate model,\nsuggested it would be possible to reduce atmospheric CO2\nconcentrations by around 100 ppm (from maximum levels\nbetween 600 and 800 ppm) over approximately 60\u201380 years,\ncorresponding to a fall in temperature of around 0.5 \u25e6C during\nthis time. Recently, Wigley et al (2007) did examine a set\nof concentration overshoot pathways, again with a simple\nmodel, and derived both the future temperature rise and most\nimportantly the greenhouse gas emissions that would lead to\nthe given pathways (but without a treatment of climate and\ncarbon cycle uncertainty). They demonstrate that recovery\nto lower temperatures within a century timescale is difficult.\nIn fact, the overshoot scenario considered by Wigley et al\n(2007) may, for a period, require negative global emissions\nof CO2. The linkage between concentration and temperature\novershoot trajectories and emissions scenarios depends on\nkey uncertainties of the climate system, especially, climate\nsensitivity and ocean heat uptake (Knutti et al 2005). The\nlinkages also depend on the still uncertain climate\u2013carbon\ncycle feedback, which has been investigated for \u2018business-as-\nusual\u2019 scenarios with large increases in emissions (e.g. Cox\net al 2000, Friedlingstein et al 2006). However, there has been\nmuch less emphasis on studying this feedback in scenarios with\nlarge reductions in future emissions. Matthews and Caldeira\n(2008) did examine scenarios with large future emissions cuts\nusing a single Earth system model of intermediate complexity\n(EMIC) and they found that near-zero emissions were required\nto stabilize atmospheric near-surface temperature. It can be\ninferred that if extremely low emissions are needed for climate\nstabilization, then even lower (or zero) emissions will probably\ncorrespond to only very slow rates of recovery in global\ntemperature.\nWorking Group 1 of the IPCC fourth assessment report\nprovides only limited coverage of this type of \u2018overshoot\u2019\nscenario. For instance, Meehl et al (2007) reported an\nexperiment by Tsutsui et al (2007) that prescribed reductions\nin atmospheric CO2 concentrations by around 150 ppm over\n100 years, and the associated derived temperature response\ngave a reduction of around 1 \u25e6C. While this used a complex\nclimate model (the community climate system model), driving\nthe model with prescribed CO2 concentrations again raises\nthe question of whether such rapid reductions are actually\nfeasible in terms of emissions. Meehl et al (2007) also\nreported (in their figure 10.35) the results from five EMICs,\nand this same experiment set was analysed more fully later\nin Plattner et al (2008). These authors used a scenario\nwith emissions set to zero at 2100, by which time the\natmospheric CO2 concentration had reached between 650 and\n700 ppm. Immediately following this extreme emissions\nreduction, atmospheric CO2 concentration fell by only 50\u2013\n100 ppm over 100 years. Further, between 2100 and 2300\nthe global average surface temperature levelled out in two\nof the models and began decreasing slightly in the other\nthree. Finally, Solomon et al (2009) also used an EMIC\nto derive long-term CO2 and temperature response following\nemissions being set to zero. Their model also attempted\nto capture expected precipitation changes using a \u2018pattern\nscaling\u2019 method, although caution should be exercised as this\nmethodology requires verification for long periods of slowly\ndeclining temperature.\nThe implications of this very slow rate of atmospheric\nCO2 and temperature reduction for such a drastic emissions cut\nhave considerable implications for the climate change debate.\nUnfortunately still missing in the numerical experiments\nperformed to date that depict \u2018overshoot\u2019 scenarios is a\ncoupled (interactive) treatment of the climate system and\ncarbon cycle response using the sufficiently complex process\nrepresentations only found in general circulation models\n(GCMs). Many also lack an up-to-date treatment of the\ncombined uncertainties in the climate system and its interaction\nwith the carbon cycle.\nGCMs capture climate processes on both relatively fine\nspatial scales (typically a few hundred kilometres) and\ntemporal scales, and remain the mainstay of projections of\nfuture climate change. EMICs do represent some, but not\nall, of the processes explicitly represented in GCMs although\noften at a lower resolution. Simple climate models, by\ndefinition, aggregate all such processes affecting evolution of\nthe Earth system to much larger, often global average, scales.\nHowever these processes, such as atmospheric circulation, the\nhydrological cycle, oceanic functioning and all interactions\nwithin the carbon cycle do exhibit significant geographical\nvariation in their perturbations within a changing climate.\nIt is, therefore, prudent to check that spatially aggregated\nparameterizations in simpler models remain valid when forced\nby a range of anthropogenic emissions, especially for more\nnovel situations such as \u2018overshoot\u2019 where potential (regional)\nhysteresis effects may be important. The penalty is that\nGCMs require a massive computational overhead, and despite\nadvances in computational power, long century timescale\nsimulations still need several months to complete. Hence,\nonly a relatively few long GCM simulations are possible. It\nis in this context that simple models do remain useful in\n2\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 4 (2009) 014012 J A Lowe et al\nproviding measures of uncertainty given their capability to\nrapidly make long simulations. However, this should only\nbe done where the simple model has some demonstrated skill\nin replicating the simulations that exist by more complex\nGCMs.\nIn this letter we investigate the issue of recovery time\nin overshoot scenarios in much greater depth. The first\npart of our study uses a version of the Hadley Centre\nGCM to investigate, for the first time, the robustness of\nprevious predictions by simple models and EMICs and explore\nthe mechanisms\/processes behind the very slow temperature\nrecovery rates following dramatic reduction of emissions in\nfuture (highly idealized) CO2 scenarios. The second part of\nour work uses a simple model to estimate uncertainty on our\nconclusions and also to extend them to a more policy relevant\nscenario, and where such a scenario also includes the impact\nof non-CO2 greenhouse gases and aerosols.\n2. Methods\nThe complex GCM with carbon cycle that we employ here is\nthe HadCM3LC model. The simple climate model we use is a\nversion of the MAGICC model, with parameters representing\nthe aggregated behaviour of a range of more complex climate\nmodels (both EMIC and GCMs).\n2.1. GCMs\nThe HadCM3LC model (Cox et al 2000) couples a version\nof the Hadley ocean\u2013atmosphere GCM (HadCM3) (Gordon\net al 2000, Pope et al 2000) to an ocean carbon cycle\nmodel (Palmer and Totterdell 2001) and a terrestrial carbon\ncycle model (Cox 2001). The terrestrial carbon cycle model\nTRIFFID simulates growth of, and competition between, five\nvegetation plant functional types: broadleaf trees, needleleaf\ntrees, C3 grasses, C4 grasses and shrubs. Stomatal conductance\nand photosynthesis are calculated using a coupled leaf-level\nmodel (Cox et al 1998). The ocean carbon cycle model\nrepresents four biological components, a single class of\nphytoplankton, a single class of zooplankton, detritus and\nnutrient, along with dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity.\nAs well as interacting within the biological model, each\nof these components describing the ocean carbon cycle are\nadvected around the ocean by the modelled oceanic physics.\nThe horizontal resolution of HadCM3LC is 2.5\u25e6 latitude by\n3.75\u25e6 longitude with 19 levels in the atmosphere and 20\nlevels in the ocean. Because our focus is on changes over\ntime periods of a few hundred years it is not necessary to\ninclude very long timescale features of the global carbon\ncycle, such as a treatment of rock weathering or carbon\nsedimentation (e.g. Archer 2005). Before making simulations\ncorresponding to prescribed emission scenarios, HadCM3LC\nis spun up to achieve an initial stable state representative\nof pre-industrial climate conditions. Specifically the GCM\nis forced with prescribed pre-industrial levels of atmospheric\nCO2 concentration, and until a situation is reached whereby\nnet land\u2013atmosphere and ocean\u2013atmospheric fluxes of CO2 are\nnegligible.\n2.2. Simple climate model\nThe MAGICC climate model has been used extensively to\nmake climate projections, including use in the IPCC third\nand fourth assessments (Cubasch et al 2001, Meehl et al\n2007). It has previously been tuned to credibly reproduce\nthe global mean temperature results of seven atmosphere\u2013\nocean GCMs (AOGCMs) (Raper and Cubasch 1996, Raper\net al 2001, Cubasch et al 2001). The carbon cycle (Wigley\n1993) in MAGICC can emulate the Bern-CC and ISAM\nmodel results over the range of the SRES scenarios. In our\nanalysis we use a version of the MAGICC simple climate\nmodel to simulate the global average near-surface warming\nand its uncertainty for each of our new emissions trajectories.\nThe three specific parameters that we varied are the climate\nsensitivity (defined as the equilibrium global mean temperature\nincrease for a doubling of atmospheric CO2), the ocean mixing\nrate (which determines how quickly the warming at the surface\nis diffused throughout the ocean), and a new climate\u2013carbon\ncycle feedback factor (which either amplifies or suppresses\nthe temperature dependent climate\u2013carbon cycle feedbacks\nalready prescribed in version 4 of MAGICC). Warren et al\n(2009) show that there are particular combinations of these\nthree parameters that enable MAGICC to closely emulate the\natmospheric CO2 change and global average surface warming\nof the 11 models (forced for SRES A2 emissions scenario) that\ntook part in the C4MIP study (Friedlingstein et al 2006).\nIn our analysis, uncertainty was incorporated into\nour simulations by sampling parameter values from range\nestimates of the three parameters discussed above. For\nclimate sensitivity we draw on a widely-used probability\ndistribution of Murphy et al (2004), which has a modal\nvalue of approximately 3.2 \u25e6C. A log normal distribution of\nocean mixing rates, with a modal value of 2.04 cm2 s\u22121, was\nderived following Wigley and Raper (2001) based on a fit\nto the AOGCMs employed by Cubasch et al (2001). The\nclimate\u2013carbon cycle amplification parameter follows a normal\ndistribution whose mean and standard deviation was based on\nthe fitting of MAGICC to the C4MIP ensemble. The three\nparameter values were selected by dividing the uncertainty\nranges into nine bins, each of which is associated with a\nprobability from the distributions. A probability estimate for\neach possible triplet of parameters (729 sets of values) was then\nderived by multiplying together these individual probabilities.\nFor our new \u2018overshoot\u2019 scenarios, all 729 possible simulations\nwere performed for each scenario.\n2.3. Experimental design\nWe used four scenarios in this work, all following historic\nemission estimates up to year 2000 followed by the SRES A2\nemissions (Nakicenovic and Swart 2000) until at least 2010.\nThe first three scenarios comprised a set of highly\nidealized emission reduction experiments. In experiments\nnamed 2012E0, 2050E0 and 2100E0 the emissions followed\nSRES A2 values until being set to zero for the next 100 years\nat years 2012, 2050 or 2100. This set of emissions was\nsupplied to both the complex model, HadCM3LC, and to the\nprobabilistic version of the MAGICC model. While society is\n3\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 4 (2009) 014012 J A Lowe et al\nalmost certainly not going to reduce CO2 emissions to zero on\nsuch short timescales, the purpose of these experiments is to\nshow the overall constraints on concentration and temperature\nreduction inherent in the climate system. For simplicity, non-\nCO2 greenhouse gases and aerosol forcings were omitted from\nthese three scenarios. The simulations with MAGICC were\nextended to year 2500 (with emissions remaining at zero)\nbut computational constraints meant this was not possible\nwith HadCM3LC. As both models overlap for at least part\nof the scenarios, this allows us to estimate whether the\nsimple model has credibility in the zero emissions section\nof the scenario several decades after it deviates from the\noriginal scenario (i.e. SRES A2). This model equivalence for\nthese new emission scenarios cannot be assumed as climate\nsensitivity estimates used in the simple model were derived\nfrom an experiment in which atmospheric CO2 concentration\nwas doubled, whilst the carbon cycle climate feedback\namplification parameter was derived from model comparisons\nwith \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 SRES A2 emissions.\nOur fourth emissions scenario was less idealized and\nadditionally included forcing from other greenhouse gases,\nthe non-CO2 Kyoto gases, the Montreal protocol gases and\natmospheric pollutants including sulfate aerosol particles. This\nscenario was only used with the simple climate model. Called\n2010P3, emissions deviated from SRES A2 at 2010, peaking\nfive years later in 2015, and then reducing at an increasing\nrate until a long-term compound rate of reduction of 3% per\nannum is reached. This compound rate was then applied for\nthe rest of the numerical experiment, which, for consistency\nwith the other scenarios ends in 2500. The reduction in CO2\nequivalent emissions5 in 2010P3 are around 47% of the 1990\nvalue by 2050. Sulfate aerosol \u2018emissions\u2019 are linearly reduced\nto zero from the projected 2010 value, and over a period of\n50 years. As a sensitivity experiment we have also performed\nvariants of the 2010P3 experiment in which sulfate emissions\nwere reduced over a shorter 25 year period or a longer 100 year\nperiod.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. General circulation model simulations\nWhen the CO2 component of the SRES A2 emissions scenario\nis used to force the HadCM3LC GCM for a period up to the\nend of the 21st century, then the atmospheric concentration\nof carbon dioxide is projected to exceed 1000 ppm at 2100.\nFollowing the emissions being set to zero in the 2012E0\nexperiment (at a CO2 concentration around 404 ppm), the\n2050E0 experiment (at a CO2 concentration around 556 ppm)\nand the 2100E0 experiment, HadCM3LC simulates very\nlow rates of decline in atmospheric CO2 concentration.\nMean (regressed) rates of change for the following hundred\nyears are predicted as \u22120.2 ppm y\u22121, \u22120.4 ppm y\u22121 and\n\u22120.75 ppm y\u22121, respectively (see figure 1 upper panel). The\nmagnitudes of these rates of reduction are all considerably\n5 The CO2 equivalent emissions were estimated for the combined emissions\nof CO2, CH4 and N2O using global warming potentials of 1, 21 and 310,\nrespectively.\na)\nb)\nFigure 1.

By the time emissions are set to\nzero in the 2050E0 experiment, simulated temperature has\nalready exceeded 2 \u25e6C above pre-industrial levels. Thereafter\nthere is actually a slight trend of continued warming (around\n0.2 \u25e6C\/century) implying temperatures would remain at more\nthan 2 \u25e6C for at least a century, and possibly much longer.\nWe analyse the simulated mechanisms in HadCM3LC of\nthe removal of atmospheric CO2 for the three century long\nmodel runs following cessation of emissions. In the 2012E0\nexperiment CO2 was removed from the atmosphere over the\nsubsequent century by a combination of uptake by the land\nand ocean in a ratio of approx 1 : 2 (23 GtC and 54 GtC\nrespectively, as shown in figure 2). The relatively small degree\nof climate change that had occurred by this time meant that\nthe terrestrial biosphere was still acting as a carbon sink (due\nto increased CO2 fertilization of plant growth outweighing any\ntemperature-increased plant or soil respiration). For the ocean,\nthe increased atmospheric CO2 concentration was driving\nmodest absorption. However in 2050E0 and 2100E0 the\nremoval of CO2 from the atmosphere in the century after the\nemissions were zeroed was driven by a quite different balance\nof processes.

However what is noteworthy\nfor these two scenarios is that the warmer global temperature\n(accompanied by precipitation changes) meant that, averaged\nglobally, the terrestrial biosphere was unable to act as a sink of\ncarbon. There is a modelled net terrestrial loss of 50 GtC and\n76 GtC respectively over the 100 years following a cessation\nof emissions.\nMore details of this terrestrial vegetation and soil carbon\nexchange during the zero emissions periods are shown in\nfigure 3. In the 2012E0 case both the tropical and extra-tropical\nland regions continue to absorb carbon. In the 2050E0 case\nthere is an extra-tropical sink due to enhanced boreal forest\ngrowth, but this is smaller than the tropical carbon loss from\nboth vegetation biomass and soil organic material (respiration\nincrease for this region is larger than any CO2-fertilisation\neffect). In 2100E0 carbon loss from northern soils also now\noutweighs biomass gain and hence the extra-tropics as well as\nthe tropics are predicted to be a carbon source.\nA particular example of regional carbon cycle changes,\nwhich is present in both the 2050E0 and 2100E0 experiments\nis the simulated die-back of the Amazonian forest. This\ncontinues long after the emissions have been set to zero,\nand can be described as an \u2018ecosystem change commitment\u2019\n(Jones et al 2009). The mechanisms for Amazon die-back in\nHadCM3LC are discussed in Betts et al (2004) and Cox et al\n(2004), and are found to be forced by movement in the Atlantic\ninter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) (Good et al 2009).\nHere we have, for the first time using the most complex\nclass of Earth system model, a coupled climate\u2013carbon cycle\nGCM, demonstrated that only very low rates of temperature\nreduction follow even massive reductions in emissions. This\nis in agreement with the general conclusions from the work\nof, for example, Plattner et al (2008), Matthews and Caldeira\n(2008) and Solomon et al (2009). However, this could not have\nbeen assumed a priori because many detailed long-term carbon\ncycle changes and their meteorological forcings (as highlighted\nby the discussion of both the tropics\/extra-tropics split in\na)\nb)\nFigure 3.

In the former, the EMIC-\nderived CO2 concentration falls by around 100 ppm in the 100\nyears following emission reductions, compared to a 40 ppm\ndrop in our GCM simulation. During the same period the\ntemperature in the Solomon et al (2009) experiment falls by\naround 0.1\u20130.2 \u25e6C but in our experiment it actually rises by\n0.2 \u25e6C. However, whilst individual GCMs and EMICs allow\nus to investigate the processes that govern the slow climate\nresponse following a reduction in emissions, an ensemble of\nmodels is needed to span the range of plausible response times.\nIn section 3.2 we attempt to provide uncertainty bounds on\nthe time global average temperature is likely to remain above\nvarious target temperatures. We also extend the results to\nan emission scenario that has a higher level of likely policy\nrealism.\n5\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 4 (2009) 014012 J A Lowe et al\n3.2. Uncertainty analysis and policy relevant scenario\nIn this section we make use of large ensembles of MAGICC\nsimulations for each emissions profile of interest. An initial\ntask is to establish whether MAGICC has credibility at\nrepresenting more complex models in scenarios with rapid\nreductions in emissions. The range of temperatures (relative\nto pre-industrial) during the period 2050\u20132150 projected by\nHadCM3LC for scenario 2050E0 is 1.65\u20132.5 \u25e6C. The spread\nis caused by natural variability in the GCM and the small\nupward trend in temperature. If we select the particular\nMAGICC version that has the best fit to HadCM3LC in the\nSRES A2 scenario we find this projects a temperature rise\nof 2.15 \u25e6C for 2100 for 2050E0 emissions. Because the\nMAGICC result lies within the bounds of the projections from\nHadCM3LC decades after the cut to zero emissions, we can\nhave some confidence that the simple model can replicate the\ncomplex GCM in aggressive mitigation scenarios even though\nits parameters were derived from experiments that used very\ndifferent emissions pathways.\nHaving established at a basic level that the MAGICC\nmodel has some predictive skill for scenarios with significant\nmitigation, we consider the probability estimates from our\nfull ensemble of simple models as the warming evolves over\ntime. The three cumulative distributions in figure 4 describe\nthe probability of various amount of future warming in the\n2050E0 scenario for years 2050, 2100 and 2200. By 2100\nthe median warming is around 1.8 \u25e6C, and the probability of\nexceeding 2 \u25e6C is around 40%. The probability of exceeding\n3 \u25e6C by this time is a little less than 5%. A particularly\ninteresting feature of this plot is that the cumulative distribution\nfunctions cross over each other. This implies that as time\npasses following the cut to zero emissions, the probability of\nexceeding the higher temperatures (>2.5 \u25e6C) actually increases\nas some model variants continue to warm. However, the\nprobability of exceeding lower temperatures (<2 \u25e6C) becomes\nless as time progresses. This is because there are some simple\nmodel variants (typically those with lower climate sensitivity\nand faster response time) that have already reached their peak\ntemperature and begun to cool. The cumulative distribution\nfunctions for the warming to 2100 for the 2050E0, 2100E0 and\n2010P3 scenarios are compared in the supplementary material,\navailable from stacks.iop.org\/ERL\/4\/014012.\nBecause figure 4 shows that some of our simulations\nexhibit temperature peaking behaviour, we now focus on\nthe possible length of time for which the global average\ntemperature overshoots various temperature thresholds. These\nthresholds are selected as 1.7 \u25e6C (based on Hansen 2005), 2 \u25e6C\n(based on the EU target) and 3 \u25e6C above the pre-industrial\nlevels. Using the ensemble of MAGICC simulations and\nassociated probabilities for each run, the left-hand panels of\nfigure 5 show the evolution over time of the probability of\nexceeding the various temperature targets. The results from\nthe idealized CO2-only scenarios (2050E0 and 2100E0) are\nshown alongside those from the more policy relevant multi-gas\n2010P3 experiment. The right-hand panels of figure 5 shows\nthe cumulative probability of being over various temperature\nthresholds for a given length of time. For the 2010P3\nexperiment there is around a 55% chance that the temperature\nFigure 4. Cumulative probability of exceeding particular\ntemperature levels at 2050, 2100 and 2200 in the 2050E0 scenario.\npeaks above 2 \u25e6C, and around a 30% (20%) chance that it stays\nabove 2 \u25e6C for at least 100 (200) years.\nA further interesting feature of figure 5, seen most clearly\nin the time spent over 1.7 or 2 \u25e6C, is that whilst the probability\nof staying over this temperature target for less than a century\nis greater in the 2010P3 case than in the 2050E0 case, the\nreverse is true for overshoot times of more than a century.\nInitially, this seems counter intuitive because 2010P3 still\nhas emissions beyond 2050, albeit at a diminishing rate.\nThe main reason for this behaviour is that although the\n2010P3 simulation has a higher radiative forcing earlier in the\nsimulation (before 2050) this is due to it having a large non-\nCO2 greenhouse gas composition. Following 2050, due to the\nshorter atmospheric lifetimes of these gases, radiative forcing\nin the 2010P3 falls more quickly despite these simulations\nhaving non-zero emissions beyond year 2050. A smaller\nsecondary reason is that there are slight differences in carbon\nuptake due to different carbon cycle climate feedback in the\ndifferent warming and fertilization pathways taken by the two\nexperiments earlier in the simulations. The consequence of\nthese combined effects is that the probability of being over the\n2 \u25e6C target for more than 400 years is only around 6% for the\nmulti-gas 2010P3 scenario but is almost three times bigger for\n2050E0, despite 2010P3 having a greater probability of going\nover 2 \u25e6C earlier in the simulation.\n3.3. Sensitivity of results to aerosol forcing scenario\nOne of our key assumptions in the 2010P3 scenario is the\nrate at which sulfate emissions are reduced following the start\nof mitigation. The short lifetime of sulfate aerosols in the\natmosphere means that the radiative forcing associated with\nsulfates reduces to zero over approximately the same period of\ntime as the linear decrease down to zero in sulfate emissions.\nHere we examine the sensitivity of our results to the rate\nof sulfate emission reduction by repeating 2010P3, but using\naerosol reduction times of 25 and 100 years compared to the\ninitial reduction time of 50 years (figure 6 and supplementary\nmaterial, available from stacks.iop.org\/ERL\/4\/014012).\n6\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 4 (2009) 014012 J A Lowe et al\nFigure 5. The probability of exceeding three different temperature thresholds. The left-hand panels show the probability of being over the\ntemperature target at times during the simulation. The right-hand panels show the cumulative probability of exceeding the target for a range of\ntime periods. In the right-hand panels the initial year (0 years) value indicates the likelihood that the temperature target is exceeded at any\npoint in the experiment. Results for the 2010P3, 2050E0 and 2100E0 scenarios are presented.\nSulfate aerosol forcing is negative and reductions in\nsulfate emissions from year 2010 tend to cause a direct\nwarming. At the slowest rate of sulfate emission reduction\n(i.e. over 100 years) the probability of global average\ntemperature being warmer than pre-industrial by 2 \u25e6C or more\nat any time in the simulation is around 25%. Halving the\nsulfate emissions reduction time to 50 years increases the\nchance of exceeding 2 \u25e6C to around 55%. A further halving\nof the sulfate emissions reduction time only increases the\nchance of going over 2 \u25e6C by a further 10%. In terms of the\n50th percentile warming at 2100 (i.e. for the probability of\nexceeding temperature to be 50% in figure 6, top panel), the\nrange across the different aerosol scenarios is around 0.4 \u25e6C.\nFurther, the choice of sulfate emission reduction time also\nalters the time spent overshooting 2 \u25e6C (figure 6, lower panel),\nwith the probability of being over the 2 \u25e6C threshold for a given\nperiod of time higher for the shorter sulfate aerosol reduction\ntimes. In the most rapid aerosol reduction case the probability\nof being over the threshold has decreased by half over a\ncentury, whereas in the least rapid aerosol reduction scenario\nbetween 150 and 200 years elapse before the probability of\nbeing over 2 \u25e6C is halved.\n4. Conclusions\nPrevious work using simple climate models, or climate\u2013carbon\ncycle models of intermediate complexity, have demonstrated\n7\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 4 (2009) 014012 J A Lowe et al\nFigure 6. The upper panel shows the cumulative probability of\nexceeding a range of temperatures at 2100. The lower panel shows\nthe probability of time spent exceeding a 2 \u25e6C threshold. The results\nare present for three versions of the 2010P3 scenario with aerosol\nreduction times of 25, 50 (the base case) and 100 years.\nthe potentially long timescales for global temperatures to\ndecline, even following large reductions in carbon dioxide\nemissions. This is a result of particular importance to policy\nmakers, and especially if unwelcome or dangerous levels of\nclimate change are realized\u2014it is necessary to know that it may\nnot be easy to return back to safer levels of global warming.\nIn this letter, our first key outcome is that we have increased\nthe robustness of this result by attaining it using the most\ncomplex class of Earth system model, a GCM, complete with\nspatially resolved carbon cycle. Indeed, our analysis with a\nparticular coupled carbon cycle GCM shows that, following\nrapid decreases in emissions, even slower CO2 and temperature\ndecreases may result, compared to those previously published.\nWe recommend that our analysis be extended in future using\nadditional GCMs.\nNext we used large ensembles of simulations with a simple\ncoupled climate\u2013carbon cycle model, with each ensemble\nmember given a different parameterization and an associated\nprobability based on the existing knowledge base. This has\nallowed probability estimates to be made for the amount of\ntime for which the global surface temperature might exceed\ncritical warming thresholds. We found that for a multi-\ngas emissions scenario that peaks emissions in 2015 before\nadjusting to a long-term reduction rate of 3% per year, there\nis around a 55% probability of exceeding a 2 \u25e6C target above\npre-industrial levels. Possibly of more importance is that\nwe find a 30% probability that we would remain above this\nwarming level for at least 100 years, and a 10% probability\nthat the 2 \u25e6C threshold may be exceeded for up to 300 years.\nThis particular scenario has a reduction in greenhouse gas\nemissions approaching 50% of the 1990 values by 2050,\nwhich we note is similar to the G8 statement in 2008 to\nconsider \u2018the goal of achieving at least 50% reduction of global\nemissions by 2050\u2019. House et al (2008) showed that further\nemissions reductions beyond 2050 would also be needed to\nlimit long-term temperature increases and we include this\nongoing emissions reduction here too.\nIt is noteworthy that although our GCM simulations\nsuggest very little decline in global temperature during the\ncentury following a 2 \u25e6C warming, the MAGICC simulations\nshow there are values of key climate parameters that do allow\na faster recovery. These more optimistic possibilities do,\nnevertheless, represent recovery timescales that are possibly\nlong for society to deal with. This remaining uncertainty\nprovides extra motivation for narrowing the uncertainty bounds\non climate sensitivity, ocean heat diffusivity and the climate\u2013\ncarbon cycle feedback. Our results also imply that we need\nto focus future research not only on thresholds of dangerous\nclimate change but also on quantifying the resiliency of Earth\nsystem components (such as the Greenland ice sheet, major\necosystems or the thermohaline circulation) to temporarily\nexceeding critical thresholds for a range of different periods.\nIn adaptation cost benefit analysis, it may be appropriate to\nconsider the extra costs of temporarily adapting to levels above\nan eventual desired target temperature, with analyses of the\ntype we present here providing estimates of timescales above\nsuch targets. That such temporary resilience is important\nto assess was shown in earlier work, e.g. Schneider and\nMastrandrea (2005) and O\u2019Neill and Oppenheimer (2004).\nHere we have extended their concepts to the most complex of\nclimate models and, by using in parallel large ensembles of\nsimulations with a simpler climate model, we have been able\nto place the \u2018overshoot\u2019 issue into a probabilistic framework of\ndirect use for future planning within the climate change debate.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Joint DECC, Defra\nand MoD Integrated Climate Programme\u2014DECC\/Defra\n(GA01101), MoD (CBC\/2B\/0417 Annex C5).
