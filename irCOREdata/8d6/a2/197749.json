INTRODUCTION  \nPower cables are critical components of power systems, \nand nowadays their insulation system needs to withstand high \nvoltages up to 500kV with reliable long-term operation and \ninsulation thickness as thin as possible. Therefore, the study of \nthe ageing effect upon the insulation system of power cables is \nof interest to the cable manufacturing industry and the utilities. \nDielectric spectroscopy is a powerful tool in both ageing \nand fault detection for insulation systems including power \ncables [1-3]. Dielectric loss mechanisms which lead to energy \ndissipation and ageing of the insulation material can be studied \nby this means. Despite various spectroscopy techniques in both \nfrequency and time domain, the dielectric loss measurement of \nXLPE cables is beyond the abilities of many commercial \ninstruments because: 1) XLPE homo-polymer theoretically \ncontains only very weak polar molecular groups and is without \na net permanent dipole, thus has a very low dielectric constant \nand energy dissipation factor; 2) commercial XLPE after \nsubsequent thermal conditioning results in a material with low \nlevels of added substances such as can contribute to electrical \nconductivity and dielectric loss; 3) XLPE cables have much \nthicker insulation than typical film samples used for dielectric \nspectroscopy.  \nIt is not possible to study the loss mechanisms of power \ncables with measurements on thin film samples because of the \nfollowing reasons: 1) the morphological characteristics \n(crystalline lamella) of thin films are different from the bulk \ninsulation layer of XLPE cables; 2) unlike film samples, the \ncarbon black filled polymer semiconducting layers have unique \ndielectric properties and may contribute to the dielectric loss of \npower cables; 3) the concentration and distribution of \ninsulation defects (by-products and impurities) inside power \ncables produced by the triple extrusion manufacturing process \nis different from film samples. \nIn order to study the dielectric properties of power cables \nmore accurately, model cables with triple extrusion comprising \na conductor, semiconducting layers and XLPE insulation were \nprepared. Their dielectric characteristics were studied by means \nof both frequency and time domain dielectric spectroscopy, in \norder to determine the loss mechanisms of the XLPE power \ncables. Thermal ageing effects were investigated in this paper \nfor different types of model power cables with dielectric \nspectroscopy systems from 10\n-4\nHz to 10\n2\nHz. \nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP \nA. Cable sample preparation \nThe model power cables have three insulation materials. \nTwo of them (coded as A and B) have homo-polymer \ninsulation but different base resins. The other (coded as C) is a \nco-polymer with micron-size ethylene-butyl-acrylate (EBA) \nislands. Inner and outer semicon materials comprising of \ncarbon loaded EBA resins (coded A) were combined with the \nthree insulating materials. The cables were therefore described \nby a three letter code including the inner semicon, insulation \nand outer semicon materials respectively, e.g. \u201cABA\u201d means \ncable insulation with semicon A and insulation B. The solid \ncentral copper conductor is 1.4 mm in diameter. The inner \nsemicon layer is 0.7 mm thick and the outer semicon layer is \n0.15 mm thick. The insulation layer is 1.5mm thick. The model \npower cables with different insulation were cut into 5 meter \nlengths and thermally aged in an oven at 135\u00b0C for 60 days. \nThe thermal ageing is an accelerated ageing process and \nimitates the long term actual thermal ageing condition of power \ncables. As shown in Figure 1, the colour of the XLPE \ninsulation layer changed from grey to dark brown, which \nindicated chemical reactions have occurred inside the \ninsulation material. Unaged cables that were measured for \ncomparison were degassed at 80\u00b0C for 5 days. \n \nFigure 1 Cable insulation before and after thermal ageing. Model cables \nwithout outer semicon layer were used in the photograph \nB. Measurement techniques \nMeasurement techniques have been carefully chosen for \naccurate low loss measurement of the model cables. A \nFrequency Response Analyzer (FRA) was used to measure low \nfrequencies from 10\n-4\nHz to 1Hz, above which the dielectric \nloss is below the noise floor of the FRA technique, as detailed \nin [4]. The time domain charging\/discharging current was \nmeasured from 1ms to 10s, and Fourier Transformation was \nused to obtain the frequency spectra from 0.1Hz and 250Hz \n[5]. Electrical conductivity of the cable insulation was \nmeasured by measurement of the steady state current using the \ntime domain system. For every cable sample, measurements \nwere carried out at temperatures from 20\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C. \nIII. MEASUREMENT RESULTS \nA. FRA measurement results \nThe real permittivity \u03b5' and imaginary permittivity \u03b5'' of \nhomo-polymer cable AAA are plotted together in Figure 2, in \norder to judge the types of dielectric loss. It was found that \nunaged homo-polymer cable AAA has the lowest dielectric \nloss, with \u03b5'' only measurable at 80\u00b0C. After cable AAA was \naged, the \u03b5'' was found to have increased considerably. The \u03b5'' \nat 60\u00b0C was about the same (\u03b5''\u22480.15) as that of unaged cable at \n80\u00b0C for f=10\n-4\nHz. The \u03b5'' of aged homo-polymer cables has a \nslope of very close to -1 in the log(\u03b5'') - log(f) plot. Since the \u03b5' \nhas a very small increment at lower frequencies, the dielectric \nloss can be taken to be mainly due to DC conductivity. \nThe results for co-polymer cable ACA before and after \nageing process are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. The co-\npolymer cable was found to have higher dielectric loss than the \nhomo-polymer cables. The \u03b5'' increased significantly after \nthermal ageing and by a greater amount at higher temperatures. \nAn additional loss peak in the unaged cable sample can be seen \nfor 60\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C in addition to the DC conduction loss. \nThese loss peaks are related to the increment in the real \npermittivity \u03b5' at lower frequencies, as shown in Figure 4. \nHowever, this loss peak is overwhelmed by conduction loss \nespecially after ageing.  \n \nFigure 2 Comparison of \u03b5' and \u03b5'' between aged and unaged cable AAA \n \nFigure 3 Comparison of \u03b5'' between aged and unaged cable ACA \n \nFigure 4 Comparison of \u03b5' between aged and unaged cable ACA \nB.

A comparison between aged \nand unaged cable at 20\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C can be seen in Figure 5. It \ncan be seen that the magnitude of discharging current has \nincreased after ageing. The discharging current at 20\u00b0C \ndecayed towards 10\n-11\nA for both aged and unaged cables with \nsimilar decaying trend, but at 80\u00b0C the discharging current had \nbigger curvature in the end.  \n \nFigure 5 Comparison of discharging current between aged and unaged homo-\npolymer cable AAA at 20\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C \nFourier transformation was used to convert the time domain \ndischarging current data into a frequency domain dielectric \nspectrum.

The spectra obtained at 20\u00b0C show evidence for a \nbroad dielectric dispersion in the case of aged cable, while for \nthe unaged cable at 20\u00b0C the spectra is relatively flat. A bulk \nconduction loss is evident when the cable sample was \nmeasured at 80\u00b0C. The aged cable shows an increase in tan\u03b4 \nover the whole frequency range compared with the unaged \ncable, and the increase became greater at 80\u00b0C. For practical \nconsideration at 50Hz, the loss tangent is always higher at \n20\u00b0C than at 80\u00b0C before and after ageing. \nC. DC conductivity measurement resutls \nThe conductivity of the aged model power cables has been \nmeasured with a 1kV battery voltage supply and Keithley 617 \nelectrometer. Four hours were determined as a charging delay \nbefore taking a measurement. The measurement setup and \nconditions were the same for both aged and unaged cables. The \nDC conductivity \uf073  for the cylindrical cable insulation is \nshown in Figure 7. It was calculated using  \nLU\nIrr i\n\uf070\n\uf073\n2\n)\/ln( 0\uf03d , \nwhere 0r  and ir  are outer and inner radius of the cable \ninsulation and L  is the length of the cable sample. \nThe DC conductivity of the model power cables has been \nfound to follow well the Arrhenius equation with activation \nenergies given in Table 1. It can be seen that the activation \nenergy has increased after ageing for both homo- and co- \npolymer cables. A similar result was found for the same kind of \nXLPE measured as thin films [7] where the activation energy \nfor unaged films was 0.89 eV and 1.06 eV for aged samples.  \n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n-11\n10\n-10\n10\n-9\n10\n-8\n10\n-7\n10\n-6\n10\n-5\ntime (s)\nc\nu\nrr\ne\nn\nt \n(A\n)\n \n \naged, 20\no\nC\naged, 80oC\nunaged, 20\no\nC\nunaged, 80oC\n10\n-1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n10\n2\n10\n-6\n10\n-5\n10\n-4\n10\n-3\n \n \nfrequency (Hz)\nta\nn\n\uf064\nunaged, 20\no\nC\nunaged, 80oC\naged, 20\no\nC\naged, 80oC\nf-1\n50Hz\n Figure 7 Temperature dependent conductivity of both aged and unaged cables \nTable 1 activation energy of the model power cables \nCable AAA ABA ACA \nEa (eV) \naged unaged aged unaged aged unaged \n1.13 1.08 1.21 1.10 1.23 1.17 \nIV. DISCUSSION \nThe results on aged cables of the spectroscopic \nmeasurements using FRA and time domain measurements can \nbe merged together to obtain the spectra over a wider \nfrequency range. Figure 8 shows the merged results for aged \nhomo-polymer cables (dashed lines in Figure 8) and the \noriginal data points using FRA and time domain system.  \n \nFigure 8 Merged curves of aged homo-polymer cable at 40\u00b0C, 60\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C \nThe FRA can measure the lower frequencies when the loss \ntangent of the aged cables is above the noise floor (tan\u03b4 > 10-3). \nIt can be seen that the DC conduction loss measured in time \ndomain has very good correlation with the FRA results that \nwere measured in the frequency domain. It was found that the \nDC conduction loss increased about 10 times after the thermal \nageing by comparing with results of unaged cable. Oxidation of \nthe semi-crystalline XLPE may be responsible for the increased \nelectrical conductivity, since the amorphous region may \nincrease when the oxidation occurs and electron hopping and \nionic conduction should have an enhanced contribution to the \nDC conduction loss.  \nAt higher frequencies, the time domain dielectric \nspectroscopy (TDDS) has better sensitivity with the ability to \nmeasure down to a tan\u03b4 of 10-5. Since the DC conduction loss \nhas little contribution in this frequency range, the dielectric loss \nmay be intrinsic to the cable insulation. This intrinsic loss has \ndifferent temperature dependence to that of the DC conduction \nloss. The temperature dependence shows a minimum value for \ntan\u03b4 at 60\u00b0C and increase as the measurement temperature is \ndecreased or increased from this temperature. This has been \nfound before, e.g. on 12kV full-size XLPE cable samples [8]. \nIn rubbery XLPE the relaxation behavior of the interconnecting \npolyethylene branch chains in the amorphous region may be \nthe main contributor to the intrinsic loss. \nV. CONCLUSION \nHigh sensitivity dielectric spectroscopy measurements have \nbeen carried out on aged and unaged model power cables. \nBased on the experimental results, three conclusions can be \nobtained: \n1. The dielectric loss in the frequency range from 10-4 to \n10\n2\nHz and DC conductivity both increased after \nthermal ageing.  \n2. The thermal activation energy of DC conductivity \nincreased after thermal ageing with co-polymer cables \nhaving the highest activation energy. \n3. The DC conduction loss has Arrhenius temperature \ndependence and the higher frequency intrinsic loss at \n1~10\n2\nHz has not. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Walter S.
