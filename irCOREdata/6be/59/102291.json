This is especially so in quantum well\nsystems where the confinement to two dimensions increases\nthe exciton binding energy, and indeed in some materials the\n1s binding energy can exceed kbT at room temperature. The\nexperimental measurement of exciton dynamics however is\noften indirect and the photoluminescence sPLd at the exciton\nfrequency is taken to indicate the presence of excitons with\ncenter of mass momenta within the light cone. One example\nof this is the determination of the formation time of excitons\nfrom a free carrier plasma.1\u20138\nRecently, the intuitive notion that a peak in the PL spec-\ntrum at the exciton frequency indicates a population of\nbound excitons in the light cone has been called into ques-\ntion. Kira et al.9 studied a microscopic model of a plasma of\nunbound electron-hole pairs, which included Coulomb corre-\nlations but not the possibility of formation of incoherent ex-\ncitons. They found that within this model a sharp peak in the\nPL spectrum developed as the carriers relaxed to the bottom\nof their respective bands. Support for this view was obtained\nby Oestreich et al.10 who traced the electron-hole exchange\nenergy in photoexcited quantum wells as a function of mag-\nnetic field. They observed a gradual change from excitons to\na free electron-hole plasma as the excitation power is in-\ncreased from 4 mW to 20 mW but saw at all powers the PL\nemission at the magnetoexciton line.\nAs time-resolved photoluminescence sTRPLd is a very\nwidely used technique it is essential to understand the rela-\ntionship of an electron-hole gas to its emitted spectrum and\nhence the inferences which can be confidently drawn from\nthe photoluminescence. In a recent paper Kaindl et al11 used\nthe measured terahertz absorption spectrum to determine the\nformation time of excitons following nonresonant injection\nof a density of 1010 cm\u22122. They found that the 1s-2p absorp-\ntion peak is fully developed after 1 ns and has a linewidth of\naround 2 meV. Another recent study by Chatterjee12 exam-\nined deviations from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation in\nboth PL spectra and microscopic calculations to deduce the\ninfluence on the PL of both bound and unbound electron-hole\ncontributions.\nIn this paper we present both TRPL and terahertz absorp-\ntion results, and find that indeed PL at the exciton energy can\nbe produced without the simultaneous coexistance of a 1s-\n2p absorption, as predicted by Kira.9 First we perform both\nresonant and nonresonant TRPL to measure the onset of PL\nat the exciton energy. Second, under essentially the same\nexcitation conditions, we directly detect the presence of ex-\ncitons around K=0 by measuring the 1s-2p absorption tran-\nsition using a far infrared free electron laser. From the time\ndependence of these two signals we can identify whether or\nnot there is a correlation between the PL signal and the pres-\nence of an excitonic population around K=0.\nThe sample is a GaAs\/AlGaAs multiple quantum well\nwith 120 wells of 6.5 nm width. The barrier width is 8 nm.\nThe GaAs substrate was chemically etched to enable trans-\nmission measurements which show clear heavy and light\nhole exciton absorption peaks at 1.594 eV and 1.615 eV, re-\nspectively sFig. 1d. All experiments reported in this paper\nwere performed in a continuous flow helium cryostat at 4 K.\nThe TRPL measurements used a microscope based\ninstrument13 with two passively Q-switched picosecond\nAlGaAs lasers providing for resonant or nonresonant excita-\ntion. The laser beam was focussed on the sample to a roughly\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 073302 s2005d\n1098-0121\/2005\/71s7d\/073302s4d\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society073302-1\ncircular spot of 14 mm diameter, the pulse duration was\n<15 ps. The pulse spectra are shown in Fig. 1.

Photon energy discrimination\nof the nonresonant PL was provided by a combination of\ninterference filters which gave a narrow passband at the ex-\nciton PL energy of 1.593 eV ssee Fig. 1d. Care was taken to\nminimize the reflected signal of the pump laser by using\noblique incidence and a knife-edge as a beam-block. A po-\nlarizing beam splitter in front of the detector further reducing\nthe back scatter from the pump. Using measurements of the\npump spectrum and the optical density, the pump fluence was\nadjusted to give a carrier density of <23109 cm\u22122 for both\nresonant and nonresonant pumping.\nThe TRPL results are shown in Fig. 2. For the resonant\ncase there is some breakthrough of the pump laser but after\n<100 ps both resonant and nonresonant decays are essen-\ntially equal. The area under the resonant spike contributes a\nnegligible 6% of the total PL counts. We have fitted the\nnonresonant TRPL time profile with the sum of two expo-\nnential contributions, a rise of 160 ps for the buildup of the\nnecessary conditions for PL at the exciton frequency and a\n3 ns decay for the emission process itself. Measurements\nwere also done at a range of fluences from 0.5 to 2 times the\nvalue for the data presented here. The risetime of the TRPL\nwas found to be unchanged in this power range.\nWe now consider the interband\/intraband pump probe\nmeasurements. In contrast to the interband optical properties\nof semiconductors which are relatively well understood ssee,\ne.g., Refs. 15\u201317 and references thereind, the theory of\nphoton-excited intraband transitions has been studied much\nless extensively. An equilibrium Green\u2019s function approach\nhas been developed,18 but at high densities the theory be-\ncomes intractable, and at low densities it reduces to a simple\nFermi\u2019s golden rule result. More recently, results on the THz\nabsorption of a sample in a photonic environment have been\nobtained using the equation of motion for four point exci-\ntonic correlations.19,20 One can obtain useful information on\nthe THz absorption spectra from a calculation, based on Fer-\nmi\u2019s golden rule for an ensemble of 1s excitons. We include\ntransitions from a population of 1s excitons to all p states,\nboth bound and continuum. Transitions to other states are\nforbidden by conservation of angular momentum. The re-\nquired two-dimensional s2Dd excitonic wave functions are\nwell known,15 and the THz absorption coefficient is then\naTHzsvd = a0svdfSBsvd + Qs\"v\/ERydSCsvdg ,\nSBsvd =\n1\n8on=2\n\u2018 F sn \u2212 1d2n\u22125s2n \u2212 1d5\nn2n+3\n3 dS \"vERy \u2212 4 + 1sn \u2212 s1\/2dd2DG ,\nSCsvd = 288\nUFS32 + iKsvd ;4;3; 1s1\/2d \u2212 si\/KsvddDU2\ns4 + Ksvd2d3S1 + expS\u2212 2pKsvdDD\n.\nHere, SB is due to transitions between the 1s and bound p\nstates, SC is due to transitions to continuum states, a0svd\n=p2n0e\n2aB\n2v \/ s8ERynBcd, n0 is the exciton density, e the\ncharge on an electron, aB the exciton Bohr radius, ERy the\nexciton Rydberg and c the speed of light.

The dashed line is a\nbiexponential least squared fit as described in the text.\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 073302 s2005d\n073302-2\nWe expect the inhomogeneous broadening of the 1s-2p peak\ndue to well width fluctuations, etc., to be less than that of the\nexciton features in the interband spectrum, as such fluctua-\ntions alter the exciton binding energies less than the band\ngap. This is confirmed by broadband THz measurements in\nwhich a FWHM linewidth of around 2 meV was found for a\nsimilar system of 50 quantum well periods.21 Thus we can\nreliably use the induced absorption at the 1s-2p transition\nenergy as a signature of the presence of bound states in the\nelectron hole plasma.\nThe two-color pump-probe absorption measurements\nwere performed at the Dutch Free Electron Laser Facility\nsFELIXd with a 100 fs, 75 MHz Ti:sapphire laser as the tun-\nable excitation source and the free electron laser as the far-\ninfrared sFIRd probe. The Ti:sapphire laser was electronically\nsynchronized to the free electron laser.22 FELIX operates\nwith macropulses of typically 4 ms width at a repetition rate\nof 5 Hz. The macropulse consists of a train of micropulses,\neach with duration 15 ps, and with a pulse separation of\n40 ns. The repetition rates of the probe and pump pulses are\nin the ratio 1:3 but every probe pulse overlaps in time with a\npump pulse. To reduce the effect of probe pulse fluctuations\nan identical reference was taken from the probe beam with a\nbeam splitter, delayed by 20 ns and recombined colinearly\nwith the probe. The reference pulse passes through the same\npart of the sample but arrives 6.7 ns later than the previous\npump pulse sby which time the PL from the sample has\nalmost completely decayed, see Fig. 2d. By reversing the bias\nof the probe detector at 50 MHz the time-averaged output of\nthe detector was thus balanced to zero unless the pump pulse\ncauses a change in the transmission of the probe pulse rela-\ntive to its reference copy.23\nThe pump beam and the probe\/reference beam were fo-\ncussed on the sample with a f =7.25 cm parabolic mirror\nresulting in spot sizes of 800 mm and 900 mm, respectively.\nAn 800 mm aperture was placed close to the sample to en-\nsure full overlap of the pump and probe beams at the sample.\nThe probe and reference pulse fluences at the sample were\nestimated to be 3 mJ cm\u22122 each. The sample was cooled in a\ncontinuous flow helium cryostat and the whole experiment\nincluding the cryostat was set in a box purged with nitrogen,\nas there is strong water absorption at these wavelengths. The\nspectral width of the pump pulses was 10 meV.\nIt is important, in order to meaningfully compare the\nTRPL and the pump-probe results, that the number of pho-\ntoexcited electron-hole pairs be the same in both experi-\nments. In such short pulse experiments the carrier density is\ndetermined by the fluence and thus the laser power at the\nsample was adjusted to have the same fluence in both the\npump-probe and TRPL experiments thereby generating the\naforementioned pair density of <23109 cm\u22122.\nWe characterized the 1s-2p transition by measuring the\ntransmission change of the FIR pulse as a function of the\ndelay between pump and probe for various values of the\ninterband pump photon energy. The probe wavelength of\n150 mm s8.3 meV, 2.0 THzd was chosen at the center of the\n1s-2p absorption line. As can be seen in Fig. 4 when pump-\ning at 1.56 eV, well below the interband exciton peak, no\nchange in transmission was seen. This null result is an im-\nportant one as it confirms that residual coherent interactions\ndo not give rise to a measurable signal. When pumping di-\nrectly into the exciton resonance, curve sbd, a strong induced\nabsorption was seen immediately after the pump pulse. This\nreflects the creation of geminate excitons and their subse-\nquent excitation by the FIR pulse from the 1s to the 2p state.\nThis induced absorption was long-lived, showing little decay\nover the 500 ps window afforded by the FEL setup, consis-\ntent with the decay seen in the TRPL.\nAs shown in curve scd, with the pump energy tuned to\n1.658 eV as in the TRPL experiment, the absorption change\nbecomes very small with no delay in the onset of absorption\nwithin the accuracy of the experiment s<7 psd. Neither is\nthere any measureable evolution of the induced absorption\nduring our 450 ps measurement window. Tuning the inter-\nband pump between curves sbd and scd in Fig. 4 resonantly\nexcites a significant fraction of light hole excitons which\ncomplicates the interpretation and we do not address these\nmeasurements here.\nFIG. 3.

The traces have been offset vertically for clarity.\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 073302 s2005d\n073302-3\nWe now discuss the conclusions we can draw from Figs. 2\nand 4. The main observation lies in the discrepancy between\nthe TRPL and the FIR transmission measurements well after\nthe pump pulse. For the TRPL detected at the exciton energy,\nboth resonant and nonresonant signals are essentially equal\nafter <100 ps, whereas the induced absorption at the 1s-2p\nenergy is at least eight times larger for resonant than for\nnonresonant pumping. Thus the PL at the exciton energy and\nFIR transmission at the 1s-2p energy cannot both be reliable\nsignatures of the presence of 1s excitons within the light\ncone.\nPrevious TRPL measurements1\u20135 suggested that after non-\nresonant excitation, hot excitons with a finite center of mass\nmomentum are created in ,20 ps by emission of an LO\nphonon. These dark excitons then slowly relax along the ex-\nciton dispersion via acoustic phonons to the K=0 state from\nwhere PL emission occurs. In a simple picture such excitons\nwould induce an FIR absorption regardless of their center of\nmass momentum and would hence contribute to the induced\nabsorption signal seen in the nonresonant pumping measure-\nment. A more detailed examination shows that the 1s-2p en-\nergy is itself dependent on the exciton center of mass\nmomentum,24 increasing by about 1 meV in our case. Given\nthat, the FIR probe is no longer fully resonant with this tran-\nsition, from our measurements we cannot make any firm\nconclusions about the formation or otherwise of such hot\nexcitons. However we note that hotexcitons, having a large\ncenter of mass momentum would in any case not contribute\nto the measured PL.\nThe residual absorption seen on curve scd of Fig. 4 is\nabout 13% of the signal in the resonant case. This could arise\nfrom the 1s-2p transitions of any nongeminate heavy-hole\nexcitons formed from the plasma. These may be either within\nthe light cone around K=0 or, more likely, distributed over\nthe exciton dispersion. By comparison with the resonant sig-\nnal the total population of such excitons would be around\n10% of the injected population. However, were this to be the\ncase, we would expect the PL intensity to be accordingly\nreduced by a factor of at least 10 compared to the resonant\ncase which is not what is observed. We conclude from this\nthat the PL we are detecting at the exciton energy in the\nnonresonant pumping case arises from the majority of the\ninjected population and not from a small fraction thereof.\nOur observations are consistent with the proposal of Kira\net al.9 that uncorrelated plasma terms provide a source for PL\nat the exciton energy.\nFurther support comes from the 160 ps risetime of the\nTRPL in the nonresonant case. No such rise is seen in the\nnonresonant, induced absorption signal which appears\npromptly with the pump pulse. Thus this TRPL rise, which is\noften interpreted as the formation time of excitons in not\naccompanied by a concomitant rise in the FIR induced ab-\nsorption at the 1s-2p energy.\nThe residual prompt absorption seen on curve scd of Fig. 4\nmay have other contributions which are difficult to separate.\nOne contribution will come from Drude-type free carrier\ncontributions11 and a second from 1s-2p transitions of light\nhole excitons which have been populated from the tail of the\npump spectrum via LO-phonon emission.\nIn conclusion we have provided experimental evidence in\nsupport of the remarkable prediction of Kira et al., that PL at\nthe exciton energy may be observed without the existence of\nan excitonic population at K=0.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support by the\nStichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie (FOM)\nin providing the required beam time on FELIX and appreci-\nate the skillful assistance by the FELIX staff.
