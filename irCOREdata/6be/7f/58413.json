It is the toxic\neffects of excess Se that first brought attention to the health\nimpacts of this element(1,2), i.e. selenosis in human subjects\nand blind staggers and alkali disease in livestock. Even\nbefore the symptoms were attributed to Se poisoning there\nare historical references to the toxic effects of Se on live-\nstock. Pedro Simon, a 16th century missionary, recorded\nthat in areas of Columbia farm animals suffered from hair\nloss and other abnormalities(3). Approximately 400 years\nlater the cause was attributed to poisoning by Se taken up\nby plants in seleniferous soils(4). Even earlier in the 13th\ncentury there are apocryphal tales of Marco Polo\u2019s horses\nsuffering from lost hair and hooves in ancient Suzhou of\nwestern China, again attributed to Se poisoning. However,\nrecent research concludes that whilst suffering symptoms\nsimilar to Se poisoning, the ailment of the horses recorded\nby Marco Polo in 1295 might not have been selenosis(5).\nLiterature on the role of Se as an essential trace element\nwas published in the 1950s(6), although it is really in the\nlast few decades that there has been a substantial increase\nin research into the health impacts of Se deficiency. This\nresearch has been catalysed by certain key medical inves-\ntigations such as the discovery in 1971 that glutathione\nperoxidise is a selenoenzyme(7) and the landmark clinical\ntrial that appears to show that Se can reduce the risk of\nAbbreviations: BGS, British Geological Survey; KD, Keshan disease.\n*Corresponding author: Dr Christopher C.

A range of health conditions relating to Se intake\nare considered elsewhere(9) and are discussed later in the\npresent paper.\nThe study of the behaviour and distribution of chemical\nelements in the Earth is a subdiscipline of geology referred\nto as geochemistry. Eleven elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg,\nMn, Na, O, P, Si and Ti) are described as major elements\nas they form >99% (w\/w) of most rocks. All other ele-\nments are generally less abundant and when concentrations\nare <1000 mg\/kg they are described as trace elements.\nSe is considered to be a trace element, placed 70th in\nabundance of the list of eighty-eight naturally-occurring\nelements in the Earth\u2019s crust(10). The interest in Se as an\nessential trace element in the human diet, as well as its\npotential to be toxic in Se-rich areas, has increased the\ninterest in Se geochemistry and this position is reflected in\nthe many texts that discuss Se in the environment (for\nexample, see Thorton et al.(11), McNeal & Balistrieri(12),\nHaygarth(13), Plant et al.(14) and Fordyce(15)).\nA better knowledge of the distribution of Se in the sur-\nface environment facilitates an understanding of its possi-\nble impact on human and animal nutrition and health. In\nparticular, an understanding of the physico-chemical\nproperties that control the movement of Se in the food\nchain (e.g. soil pH, organic content and speciation) enable\na better prediction of potential risks from Se deficiency and\ntoxicity. In the late 1990s a number of case studies in\nSe-deficient and Se-toxic areas of China were conducted\nby the British Geological Survey (BGS), in collaboration\nwith scientists from the Chinese Institute of Rock and\nMineral Analysis. These studies were carried out in re-\nmote areas in which a good connection could be made\nwith human health and the local environment on which the\nlocal population were very dependent for their food and\nwater supplies. Results from the Zhangjiakou District of\nChina(16) are summarised here as a way of illustrating the\nfactors that control Se in the surface environment and how\nthe environmental Se status relates to human Se status.\nGeochemistry of selenium\nSince its discovery in 1817 by Jons Jakob Berzelius Se has\nbeen an element that has attracted little attention and study\nby geochemists. As its concentrations in most geological\nmaterials are very low it has been difficult to study its\ndistribution at the Earth\u2019s surface. It was Se toxicity in the\nenvironment that first attracted substantial attention to Se\ngeochemistry and at about the same time, in the 1930s,\nindustrial uses for Se began to develop (e.g. invention of\nthe photocopier and Se rectifiers), driving a demand for Se\nas a commodity (Table 1).\nWith the improvement in analytical methodology in\nrecent years low levels of Se can more easily be deter-\nmined routinely in geological and other environmental\nsamples. For example, using X-ray fluorescence spectro-\nmetry, particularly X-ray fluorescence energy dispersive\nspectrometry, the BGS now routinely produces regional\nmaps of Se in soils and stream sediments based on the\nanalysis of thousands of samples (e.g. Wales geochemical\natlas(17) and Fig. 1).\nChemical properties and production\nSe (atomic number 34, atomic mass 78.96 and period\ngroup 16) has chemical and physical properties that are\nintermediate between those of metals and non-metals. In its\nchemical behaviour it resembles S and exists in similar\noxidation states (see Table 2). The oxidation state of Se is\ncritical in determining its availability in the food chain. For\nexample, in neutral-to-alkaline soils Se6 + (selenate) is the\ndominant species. This form of Se is generally more soluble\nand mobile in soils and is readily available for plant uptake.\nSelenite (Se4 + ) has lower solubility and a greater affinity\nfor adsorption on soil particle surfaces than Se6 + and hence\nselenites are less bioavailable in agricultural crops(18).\nThere are no mines in the world that specifically extract\nSe; instead it is a by-product of the production of other\nmetals (e.g. refining of Pb and Cu) or recovered from the\nsludge accumulated in H2SO4 plants.\nDistribution and cycling\nAs rocks and minerals at the Earth\u2019s surface are the pri-\nmary source of Se in the terrestrial environment, knowing\nits natural abundance in these sources is important to under-\nstanding Se distribution. Average crustal abundances of\nSe are generally very low (0.05\u20130.09 mg\/kg)(19). Intrusive\nigneous rocks, e.g. granites, rarely exceed these concen-\ntrations. For extrusive (volcanic) rocks Se concentrations\nare more complex. Ash and gases associated with volcanic\nactivity can contain substantial quantities of Se(20) but this\nprocess leaves behind volcanic rocks such as basalts and\nrhyolites that have relatively very low concentrations of\nSe(21\u201324). Generally, sedimentary rocks are richer in Se\nthan are igneous rocks but limestones and sandstones will\nrarely contain >0.1 mg\/kg(24). As it is estimated that\nTable 1.

Very high concentrations (>300 mg Se\/kg) are\nreported in some phosphatic rocks, reflecting similarities\nin the PO4\n3\u2013 and SeO4\n2\u2013 anions(21\u201324). Coal and other\norganic-rich deposits tend to have higher levels of Se, with\ntypical ranges from 1 mg\/kg to 20 mg\/kg, although values\nof >600 mg\/kg are reported for some black shales(22). A\nsummary of the Se content in some common rock types is\ngiven in Table 3.\nAs a chalcophile element (i.e. an element that prefers a\nsulfide host rather than a silicate one) Se is often found\nin sulfide mineral deposits in which it substitutes for S in\nthe mineral crystal lattice (e.g. pyrite, chalcopyrite and\nsphalerite). S and Se have similar ionic radii (Se2\u2013 0.184\nnm and S2\u2013 0.198 nm) and similar electronegativities\n(Se 2.4 and S 2.5)(26). There are Se minerals such as\ncrookesite (Cu, Tl, Ag2Se), clausthalite (PbSe) and berze-\nlianite (Cu2Se), but these minerals are rare compared with\nsulfides. Elemental Se0 is occasionally reported(21,24,27).\nThe geographical distribution of Se in an area with\ndiverse geology is likely to be quite variable, reflecting\nthe occurrence of different rock types or sulfide mineral\ndeposits. Higher levels of Se would be expected in environ-\nments in which the underlying bedrock consists of\nthe high-Se sedimentary rocks described earlier or because\nof the occurrence of sulfide mineralisation. This feature\nis well illustrated by the Wales regional geochemistry\nmap for Se in stream sediments (Fig. 1). This map has\nbeen produced by the BGS\u2019s Geochemical Baseline Survey\nof the Environment regional geochemical mapping pro-\ngramme(28) and is based on the X-ray fluorescence\nTable 2.

This map of Se shows regional\nhigh levels associated with sulfide mineralisation (Parys\nMountain, Snowdon and the Harlech Dome) and with rock\ntypes that are relatively high in Se (Pembrokeshire and\nSouth Wales coalfields and Mercia Mudstone). These\nlevels contrast with the lower concentrations associated\nwith the sandstones and siltstones of mid-Wales. Similar\nregional geochemical maps for Se in soils and stream\nsediments are available for central and eastern England(29)\nand Northern Ireland.\nAn overview of the cycling of Se(13) looks at the various\ncompartments in the global cycle to describe the annual Se\nflux (Table 4). This flux pattern demonstrates two impor-\ntant facts, i.e. that the marine system constitutes the main\nnatural pathway for the cycling of Se but it is anthro-\npogenic activity that is a major source of Se migration.\nNatural release of Se is estimated to be 4500 t\/year com-\npared with the estimated anthropogenic release of 76 000\u2013\n88 000 t\/year, which represents a biospheric enrichment of\n17 and indicates the important influence of man in the\ncycling of Se(30). Common anthropogenic sources of Se in\nthe environment are shown in Table 5. Important sources\ninclude the combustion of coal and petroleum fuels, metal\nextraction processes and the use of phosphate fertilisers\nand sewage sludge in agriculture.\nA combination of natural and anthropogenic controls can\nbe seen in the soil Se from northern Europe (Fig. 2).\nAlthough this map from the geochemical atlas of the agri-\ncultural soils of Northern Europe(31) is based on low-den-\nsity sampling (one site per 2500 km2), it still delineates both\nnatural and anthropogenic features that control the dis-\ntribution of Se. The higher values in Russia can be related\nto black shales. On the west coast of Norway high levels of\nSe are caused by a combination of organic-rich soils and\ninput of Se via sea spray. In Finland high concentrations are\nassociated with agricultural soils (fertiliser supplemented\nwith selenate(32)) and in the north very-organic-rich soils\n(peatland) turned into agricultural fields. The most intri-\nguing feature of this map is that for the part of northern\nGermany that was sampled there is a clear boundary\nbetween low and moderate Se in the top soils. This pattern\nfollows the old East\u2013West Germany border and probably\nreflects the use of Se-rich fertilisers in the west.\nSelenium in soil\nSoil is of fundamental importance in the food chain and is\nof great importance in determining the Se status of crops\nand livestock. The world mean value for soils is 0.4\n(general range 0.01\u20132) mg\/kg(15). With the exception of\ninstances of anthropogenic modification, in most cases\nthere is a very strong correlation between the concentration\nof Se in the geological parent material and the soils derived\nfrom them. While the geological source of Se is a primary\ncontrol on soil Se concentration, there are a number of\nbiological and physico-chemical properties that control the\nSe bioavailability (i.e. the mobility and the uptake by\nplants and animals) and hence its concentration in foods.\nThese factors include the prevailing pH and redox condi-\ntions, the form or speciation of Se, soil texture and\nmineralogy, organic matter content and the presence of\ncompetitive ions(15). Many of these variables and their\nrelationship are illustrated in Fig. 3.\nA practical example of the importance of soil Se bio-\navailability is illustrated by considering two areas of high-\nSe soils from the USA. In the northern Midwest there are\nSe toxicity problems in plants and livestock from soils\ncontaining 1\u201310 mg Se\/kg because \u00a3 60% of the element\nis readily bioavailable in the semi-arid alkaline environ-\nment. In contrast, soils in Hawaii containing as much as\n20 mg\/kg are not associated with similar toxicity problems\nbecause the Se is held in Fe and Al complexes in the\nhumid lateritic soils(33).\nHealth impacts of selenium deficiency and toxicity\nThe health impacts of Se deficiency and toxicity on both\nhuman subjects and livestock are well documented else-\nwhere (for example, see Rayman(9), Fordyce(15), Reilly(3)\nand Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition(34)). On a\nglobal scale overt Se toxicity in human subjects is far less\nwidespread than deficiency(15). Consequently, the present\npaper is more focused on deficiency than toxicity.\nThe recognition of the detrimental effects of too much Se\non livestock in the Midwest states of the USA was inevitably\nfollowed by studies of Se toxicity in human subjects(3).\nWhile initial studies showed elevated urinary Se concen-\ntrations in the population but no definite links to clinical\nsymptoms of selenosis, a higher incidence of gastrointestinal\nproblems, poor dental health, diseased nails and skin dis-\ncolouration, now recognised as symptoms of Se poisoning in\nhuman subjects, has been reported(35). Endemic selenosis in\nChina became highlighted in the scientific literature during\nthe 1980s(36\u201338), although outbreaks of endemic human\nTable 4.

This condition was found to be asso-\nciated with high-Se crops grown on soils derived from coal\ncontaining >300 mg Se\/kg. The main symptoms of Se poi-\nsoning in Enshi were observe to be hair and nail loss but\ndisorders of the nervous system, skin, poor dental health,\ngarlic breath and paralysis were also reported and between\n1961 and 1964 morbidity rates reached 50% in the worst-\naffected villages(15). A more modern Se toxicity problem\ncan be related to mineral supplement intake. In the USA in\n1984 twelve cases of selenosis were reported when tablets\ncontaining 27\u201331 mg Se (approximately 182 times more\nthan concentrations stated on the label) were taken. Total\nindividual doses estimated to be consumed by the indivi-\nduals ranged from 27 mg to 2387 mg(39).

Optimal\nintakes must consider the species of Se ingested, the\nmedical condition being addressed, the overall nutritional\nadequacy of the group or population, the extent to which\ngenomic differences between individuals or populations\nmay be relevant, other risk or lifestyle factors that may be\npresent and, most importantly, the background Se intake in\nthat population (for discussion, see Rayman(9)).\nIn the body Se is used as part of a group of molecules\nknown as selenoproteins that contain the amino acid seleno-\ncysteine. These selenoproteins have a variety of functions\nincluding: glutathione peroxidise, antioxidant defence; thio-\nredoxin reductase, cell redox control; selenoprotein SEPS1,\nanti-inflammatory; selenoprotein P, Se transport in the\nplasma(43).\nKeshan disease (KD) is a medical condition in human\nsubjects that is associated with Se deficiency and the sub-\nject of a case study highlighted later in the present paper. It\nis an endemic cardiomyopathy (heart disease) that derives\nits name from substantial occurrences in Keshan County,\nnorth-east China, with annual prevalence exceeding forty\ncases per 100 000 of the population and 1400\u20133000 deaths\nper year(38). Affected populations are characterised by very\nlow Se status as indicated by hair Se contents. Like many\nof the conditions associated with Se deficiency there are\nbelieved to be other contributory factors to KD. More\nrecent studies (for example, see Li et al.(44)) have demon-\nstrated a high prevalence of the Coxsackie B virus in\npatients with KD, which is now thought to be a cofactor in\nthe disease.\nSelenium status in human subjects is linked\nto the environment\nSe status in human subjects can be assessed by determining\nSe levels in blood (whole blood, serum or plasma), hair,\nnails and urine(3). The geochemistry of Se described earlier\nprovides a guide to the relative amounts of Se that may be\nexpected in a particular geological setting and studies of\nSe in the soil, drainage sediments, water and crops give an\nindication of environmental Se status.\nIt has been noted that there is a marked variation in Se\nintake and status (as measured in blood, plasma or serum,\ntoenails or hair) from one part of the world to another and\neven between different parts of the same country(41,45).\nFig. 4 shows serum or plasma Se levels from a compilation\nof European studies and puts these data in the context\nof the optimal levels required for glutathione peroxidise\nand selenoprotein P activity. These data for Europe, espe-\ncially when put into the context of US serum Se levels of\n125\u2013137mg\/l (as measured in recent US National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Surveys(46,47)), demonstrate\nthat European populations are generally of low Se status.\nHair analysis has been used in several studies of Se status\nin China(48) and is also the method that was used by\nthe BGS\u2019s Se case studies carried out in China in the\n1990s(16,49,50). Whilst the methodology for hair sampling\nis not generally standardised and the hair can be con-\ntaminated from external sources (e.g. Se-containing sham-\npoos), it is a technique that can be easily carried out by\nnon-medical personnel.\nThe importance of understanding Se speciation in rela-\ntion to its distribution and behaviour in soils has been\ndiscussed earlier. An understanding of food-chain Se and\nhealth equally needs knowledge of more than only total Se\nconcentrations. Health effects, both beneficial and toxic,\nthought to be associated with specific Se species are\ndescribed elsewhere(51).\nBaseline geochemical maps (e.g. Fig. 1) give an\nimmediate impression of whether there is high or low Se in\nthe environment, although it is only in recent years that\nsuch baseline maps have been produced.

The objective of the project was to develop a\nmethodology for delineating where Se deficiency or toxi-\ncity posed a health risk. The environmental geochemical\ncontrols on the distribution of Se-responsive diseases were\nalso evaluated. The case study carried out in the KD belt in\nthe Zhangjiakou District(16) serves as a good example of\nhow the environmental and human Se status can be deter-\nmined and compared.\nOn a regional scale the area investigated is part of the\nKD belt shown as being a Se-deficient ecological land-\nscape(38) (Fig. 6). However, within this belt some villages\nwere found to be more susceptible to KD than others. The\ncase study in Zhangjiakou District was designed to look\nat villages on a local scale in order to determine which\nfactors could account for high incidences of KD in some\nvillages whilst other villages in the same county had\nmoderate or no incidence of the disease. The study was\nconstrained by budget to a 10 d period of fieldwork and\nwas timed to coincide with the harvest so that the wheat\nand the soil on which it was grown could be sampled\nsimultaneously.\nThe investigation has been described in more detail(16)\nand the following is a summary account. The project was a\ncollaboration with the Chinese Institute of Rock and\nMineral Analysis and depended on the excellent medical\nrecords that documented the health of every villager in the\ntarget communes. The sampling strategy targeted fifteen\nvillages within the Se-deficiency belt: five with no inci-\ndence of KD; five with moderate incidence (>0\u20133%); five\nwith high incidence (>3%). From each village five sam-\nples of soil and grain and one sample of the village\ndrinking water were collected to represent the Se status of\nthe local environment and five human hair samples to\nrepresent the human Se status.\nMuch of the area was quite mountainous, making access\ndifficult. Villages (populations of 200\u2013400) were quite\nisolated and connected by dirt tracks that were impassable\nduring bad weather. This isolation of villages and the near\nsubsistence level of existence made the region ideal for\ninvestigating how local environmental factors were influ-\nencing the rates of incidence of KD.\nSe was determined using hydride-generation atomic\nfluorescence spectroscopy and a summary of the Se results\nfor the four sample media is shown in Fig. 7. It is clear\nthat both the human Se status (as indicated by hair) and\nthe environmental Se status (as indicated by water, grain\nand soil) are Se deficient. The grain values are less\nthan half those reported for UK wheat and soil values are\none-quarter to half the UK average. The thresholds for\nFig. 5.

However, soils show the opposite\ntrend; whilst levels are still very low, the highest con-\ncentrations of soil Se are found in fields surrounding vil-\nlages with the highest incidences of KD.\nAn explanation for this paradox can be seen by looking\nat some of the other variables determined for the soil\nsamples. The overall total soil Se content is low and with\nwater-extractable Se representing generally <1% of the\ntotal the determination of the very low concentrations of\nwater-extractable Se was found to be very difficult. How-\never, the higher percentage of water-extractable Se is pre-\nsent in the samples from villages with no incidences of KD\nand the majority of samples from villages with high inci-\ndence of KD have extractable Se concentrations below\ndetection; thus indicating that the problem in villages with\na high incidence of KD is that the little amount of Se that\nis available in this environment is not being released from\nthe soils. Determination of a full range of chemical ele-\nments and other variables in the soils and statistical ana-\nlysis of the data shows good correlation between total Se\nand the organic matter content of the soil (as estimated by\nloss on ignition; Fig. 8). This plot is very revealing, parti-\ncularly if the soil sites are classified by their colour as an\nindication of soil type. Clearly, the black, organic-rich soils\nhave the least-mobile Se content. The conclusion from the\nZhangjiakou study is that in an already-Se-deficient envir-\nonment soil characteristics will have a very marked local-\nised impact on Se availability to the food chain and it is\nvery important to take into account the bioavailability of\nthe Se in the environment.\nHealth impact of environmental selenium deficiency can\nbe seen where food is sourced locally\nThe BGS case studies in China have demonstrated that the\nhealth impacts of Se deficiency in human subjects can be\nrelated to the level of Se in the environment if the local\ninhabitants are dependent on their immediate surroundings\nfor sustenance. In urbanised and developed regions of the\nworld in which populations are less dependent on their\nimmediate environment for foodstuffs and drinking water,\nestablishing a link is more difficult. However, maps such\nas Fig. 1 are invaluable in understanding the Se concen-\ntrations in crops and livestock and can be used to predict\nwhich areas will have an imbalance in Se concentrations\nin agricultural products. An effective application of Se\nthrough fertilisers must be demonstrably safe to the envir-\nonment and monitored appropriately. In the UK the quality\nand quantity of baseline geochemical data will enable such\nmonitoring to be undertaken with confidence(53).\nThe recent decline in selenium status in the UK\nData on human Se intake (for example, see data from the\nUK Total Diet Study(34) and from Rayman(45)) clearly\ndemonstrate that in the UK intake has been falling and is\nnow demonstrably less than the range of Se intakes\nbelieved to be required for the optimal activity or con-\ncentration of some essential plasma selenoproteins (see UK\ndata in Fig. 4). The UK Total Diet Study shows a drop in\nSe intake from 60mg\/d in the 1980s to approximately half\nthat value by 2000(34) (Fig. 9), leaving it well below\nreference nutrient intake values (60mg\/d and 75mg\/d for\nadult females and males respectively(42)). Whilst geo-\nlogical controls can account for the generally low concen-\ntrations in UK crops relative to North America, it is\nanthropogenic activities that are thought to have led to a\ndecline in the Se status of the UK population and most of\nEurope. The following summarises the possible causes of\ndeclining Se status:\n1. changes in bread-making technology allowing the use\nof low-protein low-Se EU and UK wheat rather than\nhigh-protein high-Se wheat from North America(54);\n2. changing dietary patterns; in northern Europe meat\nand poultry are the main sources of dietary intake of\nSe.

The Scientific Advisory Com-\nmittee on Nutrition(34) reports that the main source\nof Se in the UK diet are breads, cereals, fish, poultry\nand meat and that rich dietary sources of Se include\nbrazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), fish and offal;\n3. reduced atmospheric deposition from fossil-fuel burn-\ning has reduced Se input into the surface environment.\nCoal can potentially be a very rich source of Se(15);\n4. increased use of S fertilisers to overcome S deficiency\nin arable crops has meant that there is increased\ncompetition between S and Se in crop uptake(55). S\ninputs from fertilisers and atmospheric deposition\nhave an important influence on the Se status of wheat\ngrain(56).\nRelationship between selenium status and\nenvironmental selenium from crops\nThe contrast between the Se status of North American and\nUK wheat is another good example of how environmental\nSe status impacts on crops. BGS data for >22 000 topsoils\nfrom central and eastern England show a median value of\n0.3 mg Se\/kg (British Geological Survey, unpublished\nresults). This value can be contrasted with that for soils\nfrom the Se-deficiency belt of China (Fig. 7) that have\nmedian values of 0.13 mg Se\/kg and those of soils devel-\noped on the cretaceous shale of South Dakota, Montana,\nWyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Utah, Colorado and New\nMexico in the USA that have Se contents ranging from\n2 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg(57) (see Fig. 5). The Se content of\nwheat grain from these areas reflects the soil concen-\ntrations, with 0.025, 0.016 and 0.37\u20130.46 mg\/kg for\nwheat grain from the UK(55), Zhangjiakou (China)(16) and\nUSA(58,59) respectively. There is a >10-fold difference in\nSe concentrations between UK and USA wheat, so it is\neasy to comprehend that a decline in the use of North\nAmerican wheat will result in a decline in Se in the UK\ndiet. This contrasting content of Se in wheat grain from the\nUK and USA is illustrated in Fig. 10. Data for wheat\ngrain(60) before and after Finnish supplementation of ferti-\nlisers with sodium selenate(32) is also illustrated in Fig. 10\nto demonstrate the success of this programme in raising the\nwheat grain Se content. As a consequence, the Se intake in\nFinland has grown from about 30mg\/d to 100mg\/d(61).\nNorth American wheat is now imported for more than\nUK bread making\nWhen the UK import of wheat from North America is\nshown together with the UK daily Se intake over a period\nof several decades (Fig. 9) it can be seen that in the 1990s\nthe daily intake levels of Se did indeed drop with the\ndeclining imports of North American wheat. However,\nalthough wheat imports at the end of the 1990s are higher\nthan pre-1990 levels, there is no marked increase in the UK\ndaily Se intake, as shown by the daily Se intake measured\nin 2000. This outcome would suggest that current Se intake\nlevels no longer simply reflect North American wheat\nimports; the imported wheat must now be being put to\nsome other use.\nConclusions\nIt has been demonstrated that Se intake and status can be\nclosely related to the concentration, solid-phase distribu-\ntion and speciation of Se in the local environment, which is\nlargely determined by the prevailing geochemical and soil\ncharacteristics. Knowledge of such factors can suggest\nhealth risks that might be relevant to a country or region by\npredicting which locations might be characterised by Se\ndeficiency or toxicity.

Improved analytical methods\nenable high-resolution geochemical baselines for Se in a\nvariety of environmental media to be produced. More work\nneeds to be done to integrate the spatially-referenced Se\ndatabases that exist for geochemical materials (e.g. soil and\ndrainage sediments) and crops (e.g. wheat). Collaboration\nbetween geologists, plant scientists, epidemiologists and\nnutritionists has much to contribute in the study of factors\naffecting human health.\nAcknowledgements\nC. C. J. and F. M.
