Introduction\n[2] Anthropogenic emissions of fossil fuels are the main\ncause of the increase in atmospheric [CO2] started with the\nindustrial revolution [Barnola et al., 1995]. The increase in\natmospheric [CO2] and the warming of the climate system\ninfluence the natural carbon cycle which could potentially\namplify the initial change [Friedlingstein et al., 2006]. The\nresponse of the carbon cycle to elevated [CO2] and climate\nchange thus represents one of the major uncertainties in future\nclimate projections [Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9\net al., 2007]. The future response of the climate system could\nbe explored by using ESMs with the terrestrial and oceanic\necosystems that interact with climate via the carbon cycle.\n[3] Prentice et al. [2001] showed that terrestrial ecosystem\nmodels, when projected into future climates [Cramer et al.,\n2001], showed a wide spread in their projections of the land\nCO2 sink. This feature can be mostly attributed to the fact\nthat terrestrial ecosystem models are based on the ecosystem\ndynamics based on Plant Functional Types that have dif-\nferent physiological traits.\n[4] Ocean ecosystem models evaluated in the analysis of\nPrentice et al. [2001] either completely lacked the explicit\nrepresentation of ecosystem dynamics or implemented\nsimple models based on a single type nutrient pool (N),\nphytoplankton (P), zooplankton (Z), and organic detritus (D)\nresponsible for the export of carbon (so\u2010called NPZD\nmodels) [Franks, 2002]. Ocean ecosystem models recently\nstarted to evolve from NPZD into Dynamic Green Ocean\nModels (DGOMs) that, following the example of terrestrial\nmodels, include several Plankton Functional Types (PFTs)\nand multiple nutrients limitation [Aumont et al., 2003;Moore\net al., 2004; Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2005; Follows et al., 2007]. PFTs\nprovide a link between ecosystem dynamics to biogeo-\nchemical cycles and climate.\n[5] In this study, we compare the response of two DGOMs\nto climate change showing (1) how climate change might\nimpact the pelagic ecosystem with consequences for EP and\nOCU and (2) how different ecosystem parameterizations\ntrigger regional differences.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Ocean General Circulation Model\n[6] We use ORCA\u2010LIM, a global Ocean General Circu-\nlation Model (OGCM) including a Sea\u2010Ice component\n[Timmermann et al., 2005] to model the physical ocean that\nis based on OPA [Madec et al., 1999] and LIM [Fichefet and\nMorales\u2010Maqueda, 1999]. A more detailed description of\nORCA\u2010LIM coupled to biogeochemical modules is given\nby Manizza et al. [2008].\n2.2. Dynamic Green Ocean Models\n[7] We couple two different DGOMs to ORCA\u2010LIM,\nPISCES\u2010T and PlankTOM5. PISCES\u2010T is a modified version\nof the PISCESmodel [Aumont et al., 2003; Bopp et al., 2003]\nrepresenting the ecosystem dynamics based on two phyto-\nplankton types (mixed\u2010phytoplankton and silicifiers) and\ntwo zooplankton (micro and meso) types. PISCES\u2010T also\nimplements a new parameterization of mesozooplankton\nmetabolism [Buitenhuis et al., 2006].\n[8] PlankTOM5 builds from PISCES\u2010T, it has one addi-\ntional phytoplankton PFT (calcifiers) [Manizza, 2006; Vogt\net al., 2010] and implements the ballasting effect of biogenic\ncalcite and opal on large sinking particles. Both DGOMs\nimplement phytoplankton growth co\u2010limited by light, phos-\nphorus, iron and silicate for silicifiers, and they are both\ncoupled to ORCA\u2010LIM on\u2010line. All the simulations were\ninitialized using observed fields of PO4\n3\u2212, SiO3\n\u2212 and O2, DIC,\nand Alkalinity of present climate.\n2.3. Model Forcing Set\u2010up\n[9] For the control simulations, ORCA\u2010LIM is forced by\nthe atmospheric variables obtained from the NCEP\/NCAR\nre\u2010analyzed forcing [Kalnay et al., 1996] from 1948 to 2004\nfor the (yNCEP). For the climate change simulations, we first\n1School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia,\nNorwich, UK.\n2Now at Geosciences Research Division, Scripps Institution of\nOceanography, University of California, La Jolla, California, USA.\n3British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094\u20108276\/10\/2010GL043360\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 37, L13607, doi:10.1029\/2010GL043360, 2010\nL13607 1 of 5\ncalculated a climatic anomaly for each atmospheric variable\ncontained in the re\u2010analysis with a 30\u2010year running mean\n(YIPSL30). The climatic anomalies were obtained from the\nsimulations carried out with the IPSL Earth System Model\n[Friedlingstein et al., 2001] following the IPCC A2 scenario\n[Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000] for the period 2005\u20132061.\nWe then obtained climate change forcing (yCC) for the\nprojected period 2005\u20132061 adding the smoothed anomalies\nto the unsmoothed NCEP\/NCAR re\u2010analyzed forcing:\n CC \u00bc  NCEP \u00fe YIPSL30 \u00f01\u00de\nWe retain the interannual variability of yNCEP, and prevent\ndouble counting variability by using the smoothed YIPSL30\nas done by Manizza [2006] and Vallina et al. [2007]. For\nboth DGOMs, we carry out two simulations. In the control\nsimulation we use the atmospheric forcing of 1948\u20132004\nperiod (but with projected 2005\u20132061 atmospheric [CO2])\nwhereas in the climate change simulation we apply the\natmospheric forcing of the 2005\u20132061 period (both for CO2\nand climate).\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Ocean Physical Response to Climate Change\n[10] Anthropogenic climate change impacts the main\nphysical properties of the upper ocean. The sea surface tem-\nperature increases (by up to 2\u00b0C), mixed layer mostly\nshoals (by up to 10 meter) between 60\u00b0N and 60\u00b0S and the\nextension of sea\u2010ice reduces (by up to 15%) in the polar\noceans (see auxiliary material).1 These changes are also\ncomparable to previous studies carried out with coupled\nclimate models, though with some differences in spatial\ndistribution and magnitude of the responses [Sarmiento et al.,\n1998; Friedlingstein et al., 2001; Flato, 2004; Steinacher\net al., 2010]. All these physical changes influence the\nmetabolism of planktonic organisms through the change\nPISCES-T PlankTOM5\nFigure 1. Change in RCC at ocean surface of (top) silicifiers, (top middle) mixed\u2010phytoplankton, (bottom middle) calci-\nfiers and (bottom) change in mesozooplankton biomass for (left) PISCES\u2010T and (right) PlankTOM5 as average of the last\nfive years. Units are % for RCC and mmolC L\u22121 for mesozooplankton.\n1Auxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029\/\n2010GL043360.\nMANIZZA ET AL.: OCEAN ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE L13607L13607\n2 of 5\nin water temperature and the availability of both light and\nnutrients.\n3.2. Ecosystem Response and Biogeochemical\nDynamics\n[11] In these DGOMs, climate change causes global re-\nductions in primary production, EP, and OCU comparable\nto previous studies by Friedlingstein et al. [2001, 2006] and\nSteinacher et al. [2010] (see also auxiliary material). For\neach DGOM, we calculate the relative contribution of PFTs\nto total carbon content (RCC) for each PFT at the surface of\nthe ocean as follows:\nRCC \u00bc CPFT\nCTOTAL\n\u0002 100 \u00f02\u00de\nand we show the difference between the climate change\nand the control run. The differences in the two DGOMs\n(Figure 1) show similar general spatial patterns but evident\necosystem re\u2010arrangements occur in two specific regions:\n(1) the Equatorial Pacific Ocean and (2) the Southern Ocean.\n[12] In the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, PISCES\u2010T does not\nshow any major shift in RCC of the two PFTs (Figure 1,\nleft). However, in PlankTOM5 the modified ecological\nniche is taken over by the calcifiers that have a better affinity\nfor more stratified waters and almost totally outcompete\nthe other two PFTs. The change in EP (Figure 2, top) is\ndirectly influenced by the response of ecosystem dynamics\nto physical change. In PlankTOM5 the EP reduces by up to\n30 gC m\u22122 a\u22121 whereas in PISCES\u2010T the change is not\nnotable. This difference is due to the decrease in mesozoo-\nplankton biomass in PlankTOM5 (Figure 1, bottom) due to\nthe decrease of silicifiers, their preferred food source.\nMesozooplankton fecal pellets production is one of the\nmajor routes for producing fast sinking particles. There is\nonly a limited effect from increased calcifiers on increased\nsinking speed due to the ballasting by biogenic calcite\nbecause over much of the low latitudes the sinking speed is\nalready at its maximum of 150 meter day\u22121. In both DGOMs\nthe CO2 outgassing of the Equatorial Pacific Ocean decreases\nin a future climate (by 11.3 and 54 TgC a\u22121, for PISCES\u2010T\nand PlankTOM5, respectively), due to the reduced upwelling\nof carbon\u2010rich waters (Figure 2, bottom). However, the\nreduction in outgassing is less in PlankTOM5 (29.5 TgC a\u22121)\nthan in PISCES\u2010T (54 TgC a\u22121) because of the greater\nreduction in EP driven by the ecosystem response.\n[13] In the Southern Ocean (south of 40\u00b0S) where sea\u2010ice\ncover evidently reduced silicifiers increase their RCC by\nup to 60% in both DGOMs (Figure 1, top), although in\nPISCES\u2010T they compete for resources with only one com-\npetitor (mixed\u2010phytoplankton) whereas in PlankTOM5 they\ncompete with two PFTs. The increase in RCC silicifiers is\nmainly due to the increase in vertical nutrient supply caused\nby the wind\u2010driven mixing in more ice\u2010free zones. How-\never, the increase in diatoms RCC is partially larger in\nPlankTOM5 than in PISCES\u2010T and this feature directly\nreflects on the increase in EP (91.7 TgC a\u22121 in PISCES\u2010T\nand 85.7 TgC a\u22121 in PlankTOM5) (Figure 2, top). Again, the\ndifferent response in EP (91.7 and 85.7 TgC a\u22121 for\nPISCES\u2010T and PlankTOM5, respectively) directly translates\nin a different enhancement of OCU that is larger in PISCES\u2010T\n(43.6 TgC a\u22121) than in PlankTOM5 (20 TgC a\u22121) (Figure 2,\nbottom).\n[14] It is worth to note that the reduction in OCU is dif-\nferent in the magnitude for the two DGOMs (Figure 3, top\nPISCES-T PlankTOM5EP\nOCU\nFigure 2. Change in (top) EP and (bottom) OCU for (left) PISCES\u2010T and (right) PlankTOM5 between climate change and\ncontrol run as average of the last five years. Negative differences in sea\u2010to\u2010air CO2 flux indicate an increase in OCU caused\nby climate change.\nMANIZZA ET AL.: OCEAN ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE L13607L13607\n3 of 5\nright) although the climate\u2010driven trend is similar. In fact, in\nPISCES\u2010T the reduction in OCU induced by climate change\nis always smaller than 0.1 PgC a\u22121 whereas in PlankTOM5\nthis difference is up to 0.18 PgC a\u22121 although the applied\nphysical forcing is identical. This trend in OCU mostly re-\nflects the same as shown by EP (Figure 3, top left) in both\nmodels highlighting the importance of the marine ecosystem\nrepresentation for the OCU in a future climate.\n[15] In both models a reduction in EP would mostly\ntranslate into a reduction in OCU at comparable timescales\n(Figure 3, bottom right). In PISCES\u2010T, 79 \u00b1 9% of the\nchange in EP is reflected in a change in the sea\u2010to\u2010air flux,\nwhile in PlankTOM5 the slope was very similar at 85 \u00b1 6%.\nPresumably, the other \u223c20% is dissipated due to change\nin concentration gradient of dissolved inorganic carbon\nbetween the surface and the deep ocean. In these simula-\ntions, the OCU response driven by the biological EP is the\nsum of several responses, including changes in ocean\nphysics and chemistry. To isolate the sensitivity of the OCU\nto changes in biogeochemical cycling, we additionally carried\nout five sensitivity simulations of 10 years each (with\nPISCES\u2010T only) in which we varied EP modifying the deg-\nradation rate of particulate organic matter (Figure 3, bottom\nleft). The slope was again very similar to 70 \u00b1 15%. These\nresults confirmed the direct OCU response to EP changes.\nSince the sensitivity simulations were all performed in the\nsame physical setting and the applied climate change the\nsame for two DGOMs, this response is shown to be mostly\nindependent of changes in ocean circulation, and to have the\nsame slope for different drivers of the biological changes.\nThese simulations show that these results can be comparable\nto the potential response of the marine ecosystem to climate\nchange.\n[16] The strong link between EP and OCU in our results\nis also confirmed by other studies where EP was modified\neither by changing either the aeolian dust flux [Moore et al.,\n2006] or by enhancing the nutrients supply in the coastal\nregions [Giraud et al., 2008].\n4. Conclusions\n[17] In this study we have shown that a more complete\nrepresentation of the ecological complexity in DGOMs can\nlead to different responses of both PFTs distributions and\nEP to climate change, with direct consequences for OCU\nat regional scale. A future warmer climate could produce\nan expansion of the permanently stratified ocean regions\n[Sarmiento et al., 2004] favoring diazotrophs [Boyd and\nDoney, 2002] that are well adapted to such environmental\nconditions and that are not represented in the models used in\nthis study. Adding more PFTs to these two models might\ncreate a further re\u2010arrangement in the ecosystem structure\nwhile responding to climate change with potential con-\nsequences for EP and OCU at regional scales.\n[18] Acknowledgments.
