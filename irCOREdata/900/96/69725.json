Introduction \nAnalysis of porewaters of sediments has, until relatively recently, been largely based \non measurements at resolutions of one centimetre or greater. Porewater \nconcentrations for many components were routinely determined by squeezing or \ncentrifugation of core slices and analysis of the supernatant or exuded solution from \ntypically 20-80 ml of sediment. Sorbed species were determined by selective \ntreatment of the bulk sediment. These procedures provide spatially averaged vertical \nprofiles of sediment chemistry. Heterogeneities, both vertically and horizontally, at \nscales of less than a cm, are averaged within the volume of each sediment slice.  \nObserved heterogeneity\/homogeneity of sediment systems will depend upon the \nresolution of the measurement. Figure 1 shows a schematic of how the physical \nparameter porosity may vary depending on the scaling of the measurement. At the \ngrain scale, porosity will fluctuate sharply as mineral grains, organic matter and \nporewater are encountered. At the microenvironment scale, background values will be \nclose to the average, however, distinct features such as burrows, shell fragments and \norganic matter microniches will also be apparent. Figure 2 shows an image obtained \nby slicing a resin embedded sediment core, in which both grain scale and \nmicroenvironment features are evident. Scaling issues relevant to early diagenetic \nprocesses are examined further by Morse et al (2003).  \nAller (1982; 2001) has reviewed and assessed the roles and significance of \nburrowing, tube construction, irrigation and faecal pellet microenvironments, \nintroduced by macrobenthos. Measurements using core sampling are likely to miss \nthe chemical heterogeneity at such features. Several critical limitations to the \nestablished core slicing method were reviewed by Brendel and Luther (1995). As the \naverage concentration for each section is determined, any steep concentration \ngradients, either vertical or horizontal, within a section will be missed. Mixing of \nextracted porewater from within the section causes any localized zones of species at \nhigh concentrations to be diluted, potentially by an order of magnitude or more. \nWhere the section is composed of different redox regimes, mixing of extracted \nporewater can allow chemical reactions to alter the concentrations of some of the \nredox reactive species, also potentially resulting in an apparent overlap of redox \nspecies where none exists (e.g. Luther et al, 1998; 1999).  \n 4 \nMeasurements made on cores may not accurately reflect the in situ concentrations, \ndue to retrieval artefacts. Previously observed differences between O2 measurements \nin benthic chambers and from retrieved cores have helped to identify these artefacts \n(e.g. Pamatmat and Fenton, 1968; Rowe et al, 1997). Discrepancies in O2 \nmeasurements from microprobes deployed in situ and in retrieved cores demonstrate \nthe problem directly (Figure 3). The sediment chemistry of cores may be modified in \nseveral ways, such as by pressure (decompression) and temperature changes, \nelevation of labile organic matter due to death of sensitive organisms, disruption of \nnatural flow conditions over the sediment during coring operations and redistribution \nof surface material, with consequential effects on near-surface, concentration \ngradients (e.g. Reimers et al, 1986; Reimers, 1987; Glud et al, 1994). Specific \nsampling artefacts associated with the carbonate system have also been identified \n(e.g. Murray et al, 1980; Emerson et al, 1982). Difficulties associated with specific \ncoring techniques are reviewed by Blomqvist (1991).  \nAlthough the problems and phenomena identified above have been recognized for \nsome time, our ability to study or overcome these issues has been limited by technical \nconstraints. More recently, analytical techniques have provided measurements of \nsolutes directly in situ and at a high resolution. Microsensors, including electrodes, \noptodes and micro-biosensors, have been developed to analyse many species at \nresolutions of one millimetre or higher (see K\u00fchl and Revsbech, 2001; Reimers, \n2007, for recent reviews). Optodes have been used routinely to provide two-\ndimensional images of O2 and pH concentrations at high resolution (e.g. Glud et al, \n1999; Hulth et al, 2002). Measurements of sulphide and metals on the sub-mm scale \nhave been made with diffusive gel techniques, including some limited analysis in \ntwo-dimensions (see Davison et al, 2000).  \nInterpretational difficulties can arise when sediments are analysed at centimetre and \nmillimetre resolution. Numerous articles have reported data that reveal features \nidentified by only a single data point (see Grundmanis and Murray, 1977; Docekalova \net al, 2002; Leermakers et al, 2005 for examples). Method comparisons using sub-\nmm techniques have demonstrated that micro-features in profiles are often missed \naltogether by measurements at lower resolutions (see Wenzh\u00f6fer et al, 2001; \nMortimer et al, 2002 for examples). Such apparently erratic data can not be used to \n 5 \npredict fluxes to and from microenvironments and across diffusive boundary layers, \nas, to define gradients well, the resolution must be sufficient to provide multiple data \npoints. Where only bulk data are required or where spatial trends in concentrations \nare linear, measurement techniques with inherent averaging (e.g. benthic chambers or \ncore slicing) may be more appropriate. Microscale data may adequately define \ngradients, but any flux obtained only strictly applies to the narrow column of \nsediment that the measurement encompasses. It may not be representative of the \nlarger scale flux, particularly where few probes have been deployed and averaging \ncannot be applied. However, microscale measurements may be useful in explaining \nthe variability that may arise in multiple chamber measurements, as particular \nlocalized processes can be identified.  \n1.1. Historical concepts in sediment microheterogeneity \nThere is a long history of scientific interest in sediment microheterogeneity. \nExamples from the mid 1800 s include, a study on coprolites (fossilized faeces) by \nBuckland (1835) and a comprehensive survey of benthic fauna by Dalyell (1853), \nwhich includes observations of habitat features such as mucus secretions in burrow \nstructures. Many studies in the late 1800 s focused on the tube building and habitats \nof specific benthic biota (e.g. Cunningham and Ramage, 1888; Watson, 1890; \nM Intosh, 1894). Dapples (1942) reviewed a selection of early literature examining \nsediment turnover rates by benthic biota, in terms of debris ingestion, faecal pellet \nformation\/decay and burrow processes. The studies cited above are largely zoological \nsurveys, investigating the fauna present and their habitat. However, it has also been \nlong recognised that the presence of benthic fauna must have a significant effect on \noverall diagenesis (and thus by implication sediment chemistry; e.g. Buchanan, \n1890). The hypothesis that localized reducing conditions exist in restricted areas of \nhigh organic matter was suggested by Emery and Rittenberg (1952). The idea was \ninvoked to explain both the existence of pyrite in zones of positive redox potential \nand the morphometry of the pyrite, which took the form of internal casts of \nradiolarian and other shells. This concept of localized reactive organic matter was \ndeveloped further by modelling reducing microniches within ambient oxidized \nsediment (e.g. J\u00f8rgensen, 1977). Further references in relation to historical concepts \nare cited in Aller and Yingst (1978).  \n 6 \n1.2. Rationale for microscale studies \nIn any sediment containing benthic fauna, it is likely that bioturbation will affect the \ndistribution of a number of redox components. Direct faecal deposition and the death \nof benthic fauna may be expected to cause particles of labile organic matter to be \ndistributed heterogeneously in the sediment column. The formation of feeding tubes \nand burrows affects the distribution of solutes, including those diffusing from or to \nthe sediment. Aller (1983) observed that diffusion of solutes across the mucus linings \nof burrows was retarded, resulting in the rate of diffusion across this boundary being \nonly 10-40% of the value in free solution. Several studies have revealed enrichment \nin bacterial populations at these burrow walls (Aller, 1988 and references therein). \nPapaspyrou et al (2006) observed that in some burrows the bacterial communities of \nthe linings and walls resembled those in ambient anoxic sediment rather than oxic \nsediment. The stochastic distributions (life positions) of benthic organisms may \ntherefore indirectly affect mineralization pathways by amending the distribution of \noxidants and labile organic matter. The changing redox conditions (redox \noscillations) induced by bioturbation may lead to more rapid decomposition of \norganic matter than simple unidirectional redox changes (Aller 1994). J\u00f8rgensen \n(1977) suggested that the interface between oxidized and reduced sediment could be \nsubstantially increased if reduced microniches are mixed into the oxic zone. He \ncalculated a theoretical lower limit of particle size for the formation of an anoxic \nspherical microniche to be approximately 100 \u00b5m, assuming a low ambient O2 \nconcentration and higher respiration rates than the average sediment. The nature of \nthe microniche will also have a direct influence on the porosity and will affect the \ndiffusion coefficient of solute oxidants (see also the scaling effects in Figure 1). This \nwill in turn affect the apparent O2 consumption rates. Diffusion coefficients within \nfaecal pellets may be altered due to some or all of the following factors: a smaller \naverage particle grain size than the ambient sediment, higher density (compacted \nnature), and existence of peritrophic membranes (e.g. Aller, 1982). Conversely, water \ncontent in faecal pellets has been observed to be higher than the ambient sediment \n(80% compared to 49-58%; Kristensen and Pilgaard, 2001). High-resolution images \nof particles within and surrounding faecal pellets have been presented (Figure 2; from \na larger compilation of high resolution sediment imaging by Watling, 1988). The \ntexture of faecal pellets is discussed in more detail by Rhoads and Boyer (1982). \nOther microniches such as aggregates of algae (e.g. Widerlund and Davison, 2007), \n 7 \nmay have a much higher porosity (due in part to a lack of mineral particles). In oxic \nsediments this higher porosity will theoretically require consumption rates to be much \nhigher for anoxia to occur.   \n1.2.1. Early diagenesis and pollutant fate \nStudying sediment processes at the sub-mm scale will expand knowledge of early \ndiagenetic processes and further our understanding of the relationships between the \nmicrobiology, macrobiology and chemical processes. This will in turn allow us to \nbetter understand the fate of anthropogenic pollutants and potentially enable a better \npredictive ability through more accurate modelling of the system.  \nTo date, most estimates of reaction rates within sediments have been calculated using \nconcentration profiles derived from spatially averaged sliced sediment or whole \ncores. Aller and Mackin (1989) describe several whole core incubation methods for \ndetermination of reaction rates in sediment. Methods such as these may not yield data \nthat can be used to model microenvironment processes. A model, at the pore-scale, of \nreactive transport (Meile and Tuncay, 2006) has shown that estimates of reaction \nrates based exclusively on localized pore-scale heterogeneity can be significantly \ndifferent to those estimated when these localized areas are upscaled and incorporated \ninto a macroscopic heterogeneous system. This suggests that at localized reaction \nsites the average concentration in a typical sampling volume may not be \nrepresentative of the concentration at the site of the reaction. The effect of benthic \nbiota on conditional rate constants, spatial heterogeneity, and reaction order were \nreviewed and assessed in relation to processes such as excavation, burrowing, feeding \nand ventilation activities, by Aller (2001) and Aller et al (2001). M\u00fcller and Stierli \n(1999) highlighted the importance of accurate in situ reaction rates for understanding \nand modelling early sediment diagenesis. As the volume of data from micro-scale \nstudies of sediments increases (particularly for microniches), and the data are \ninterpreted using 3D models, there will be an increasing need for the determination of \nreaction rate constants of processes occurring at the localized scale. Use of constants \nestimated using spatially averaged data is unlikely to be applicable to three-\ndimensional reaction and transport models that include microenvironments. To date \nthe few models that have attempted to simulate the effect of discrete \nmicroenvironments on sediment systems (Jahnke, 1985; Brandes and Devol, 1995) \n 8 \nhave only investigated limited components in one or two dimensions. Where \nconditions around a microniche vary over space and time only three-dimensional \nmodels give full validity. Such models of whole systems (e.g. Sochaczewski et al, \n2008) will allow estimates of changes to the system due to external influences (for \nexample sudden anoxia or an input of a pollutant) to be better predicted. Use of only a \nsingle rate constant for the whole of the system excludes the likelihood that reactions \noccurring at microniches will have a higher rate constant than those occurring in the \nrest of the sediment matrix, due to elevated microbial populations that are more likely \nto be in the exponential growth phase. Using multiple rate constants will allow \nexamination of the effect of microniches on the system and estimations of their \nsignificance.   \nAt microniches of relatively high concentration (compared to ambient conditions) the \nkinetic order of reaction may also be important when predicting diagenetic behaviour. \nAn analysis of Mo speciation by Erickson and Helz (2000) showed that a three-fold \nchange in sulphide concentration could produce a 100-fold change in the rate of \nconversion of molybdate (MoO42-) to tetrathiomolybdate (MoS42-). Such an \nobservation suggests that the assumption that reactions used in most diagenetic \nmodels are first order may not always be appropriate. Supersaturation of metals and \nsulphide at a microniche was observed by Motelica-Heino et al (2003), suggesting \nthat their rates of resupply at these locations may exceed reaction rates for \nconsumption processes. This additional complexity needs to be considered when \nmodelling sediment systems in 3D.  \n1.2.2. Role of microniches in accumulation and scavenging processes \nWhen trace metals in sedimentary rocks are used to characterise paleoenvironments \npotential effects caused by microniches must be considered, to allow accurate \nprediction of past deposition environments. For example, Mo is converted in \nsulphidic environments from a weakly binding hard base to a soft base that is easily \nscavenged by Fe-bearing sediment constituents (Erickson and Helz, 2000). If this \nprocess occurs at sulphidic microniches within the oxic zone, the sediment s ability to \nenhance accumulation of Mo is increased. This is probably an extreme example, as \nthe reduced form of Mo is less easily oxidized than other reduced metal species \n 9 \n(Shaw et al, 1990). Given the critical role of sulphide concentrations in Mo reduction, \nmicroniches may play an important role in these accumulation\/scavenging processes.  \n1.2.3. Analysis of solute distributions \nAnother benefit of sub-mm studies is the more accurate analysis of solute \ndistributions, such as O2 penetration depth. O2 microprobes allow the immediate \nenvironment around burrows and feeding tubes to be investigated at high resolution. \nInvestigation at these locations is important if fluxes estimated from diffusion \ngradients are to be compared to directly measured fluxes. However, if data relating to \nlarge-scales are required, such as an average flux for a large area of ocean sediment, \nmultiple benthic chamber measurements may be more appropriate. Equivalent results \ncould only be obtained using microsensors by making many, time-consuming, \ndeployments. Glud et al (2005) demonstrated the need to use multiple deployments at \nthe same site to predict accurately fluxes using microscale techniques. They \ncalculated an O2 penetration depth of a Sagami Bay (Japan) sediment along a 175 m \ntransect to be 3.9 \u00b1 1.5 mm based on 347 profiles. Microelectrodes provide the best \noption for the study of solute concentrations across the sediment-water interface on a \nlocal scale, as they have the least influence on the hydrodynamic conditions. \nCompression of the diffusive boundary layer (DBL) by electrodes has been assessed \nquantitatively (Glud et al 1994a). While recently developed planar optodes will allow \nthe solute distributions below the sediment surface to be described in two dimensions \nfor several analytes (O2, pH, CO2, NH4+), they have a greater effect on the DBL than \nmicroprobes because of the greater physical dimensions of the device and the \nintroduction of a wall through the sediment at the plane of measurement.  \n1.3. Scope of this review \nThis review provides a unifying framework for literature where measurements have \nbeen made on a sub-mm scale and microscale features have been identified. This \nembraces O2 probes (microelectrodes and needle\/2D optodes), other planar optodes, \ndiffusive gel probes (DET and DGT) and three high-resolution biological studies. The \nbasic principles of these techniques are identified and performance characteristics of \nthe chemical methods reviewed. The features revealed by the procedures are then \nassessed for each type of probe. With the aim of discussing the significance and \nfuture direction of microniche studies, the review considers exclusively sub-mm data \n 10 \nthat reveal microenvironments. It is not intended to be exhaustive and does not cover \ndata that reveal local features using mm or lower scale analysis. Sub-mm scale \nanalysis has the advantage of consistently providing multiple data points that define \nsolute gradients at, and in the vicinity of, microenvironments, particularly when the \ndata are available in two dimensions. When only one or two data points represent \npeak concentrations, features, and their diameters, are not well established.  \nIn order to focus exclusively on processes occurring within the subsurface sediment, \nthis review will exclude microscale measurements of photosynthetically active \nsediments. This well-studied subject has been recently reviewed by Revsbech (2005) \nand K\u00fchl (2005). These reviews are, in part, focussed on commercially available \nprobes, but the cited references provide a good catalogue of previous research.  \nSeveral other microsensors have been developed that cover a range of components \nand are capable of making measurements at sub-mm resolution, but these techniques \nare not covered in this review, as published data do not include micro-features. Table \n1 contains examples of these probes, including the maximum resolution obtained and \nthe maximum depth to which they have been deployed. A range of microelectrodes \nfor sediment analysis are reviewed in K\u00fchl and Revsbech (2001), Taillefert et al \n(2000), and Hanrahan et al (2004). See also Buffle and Horvai (2000), and Viollier et \nal (2003) for broader views of recent technologies.  \n1.4. Definitions \nIn this review, a microenvironment is defined as a small-scale location within the 3-\ndimensional sediment matrix where the geochemical behaviour is significantly \ndifferent from the average for that depth. This may be a gas bubble, a burrow or \nfeeding tube from a benthic organism, or a particle of reactive organic matter or other \ncomponent that has biogeochemical reaction rates which are higher (or lower) than \nthe surrounding environment. We reserve the term microniche for the \nmicroenvironments associated with reactive organic matter. In a microscopic study of \nmarine sediments, Johnson (1974) identified possible food sources of diameters \nranging from five \u00b5m to 1.9 mm. J\u00f8rgensen (1977) estimates a detrital particle scale \nrange of one \u00b5m to several millimetres or centimetres. There may be particular \nconditions where such particles can be considered as microniches. Based on \n 11 \nmeasurements from the studies reviewed here, a characteristic observable microniche \nscale range is from 400 \u00b5m to ~1 cm diameter.  \n2. Oxygen microprobes \n2.1.1. Microelectrode \nO2 microsensors were first used to study marine sediment at high spatial resolution by \nRevsbech et al (1980; 1980a). They used a modified Clark type electrode (Clark et al, \n1953) where a current is generated by O2 reacting at an electrode (cathode) after \ndiffusing through a membrane. The tip of a 0.1 mm platinum wire, encased in glass \nso that only the tip was exposed, was electrolytically etched in saturated KCN to a \ndiameter of 1-4 \u00b5m. A recess was then etched into the wire at the tip, and covered \nwith a membrane of collodion and polystyrene, to give a final tip diameter of 2-8 \u00b5m. \nThe anode was a separate Ag\/AgCl electrode. In the first environmental studies using \nthis electrode the measurements were made at 0.5 mm intervals (Revsbech et al, \n1980a). The method was improved by firstly electroplating the tip with gold and \nusing silicone rubber for the membrane (Revsbech and Ward, 1983) and secondly \nincorporating an internal guard cathode to quench O2 diffusing toward the sensor \nfrom the internal electrolyte (Revsbech, 1989).  \nUntil the development of O2 optodes, the microelectrode methods developed by \nRevsbech and co-workers were used for the vast majority of studies investigating \nsediment O2. As the general principles of electrode measurements are widely \nreported, they are not addressed in this review (see e.g. Mendham et al, 2000; \nReimers, 2007).  \n2.1.2. Performance characteristics \nO2 electrodes have good response times, with 90% of the maximum signal being \nreached typically within 0.2 s. Due to the very low O2 consumption and the micro-\nscale, near-spherical geometry, the measurement was found to be almost independent \nof stirring while responding linearly to the concentration of O2. Although, current \ndrift can be experienced at high and low O2 tensions and in the presence of sulphide \n(Revsbech et al, 1980), Reimers (1987) showed that current drift could be overcome \nby in-situ pre-equilibration in a powered state for 15-20 mins before commencing \nmeasurements. Reimers (1987) also demonstrated that the changes in electrode \n 12 \nbehaviour as a result of pressure variations are thermodynamically predictable. The \noperational lifetime of commercially available O2 microelectrodes made using similar \ntechniques to those described above, is two months to one year (Revsbech, 2005).  \nMicroelectrode tips have diameters in the range of 2-10 \u00b5m. This small size has the \nadvantage of minimising disturbance of the surrounding media and, because spherical \ndiffusion is promoted in solution, a steady-state current is generated. However, the \nminimum tip size tends to be restricted by the necessity of maintaining optimum \nrigidity. Flexing of the electrodes can occur when pushed towards particles, resulting \nin erratic signals (Revsbech et al, 1986). Nodules of Mn near the sediment surface \nand sharp grains can cause additional stress on the electrode tips, which have been \nreported to break in several of the studies reviewed (e.g. Reimers, 1987). This \nfragility limits deployment depths within sediments. Glud et al (1994a) investigated \nthe effect on the DBL imposed by the deployment of microelectrodes and concluded \nthat the deployment of electrodes from above the sediment surface reduced the DBL \nthickness by 25-45%.  \nThe majority of studies using O2 microelectrodes have been carried out in marine \nenvironments. However, some studies have deployed these probes in freshwater \nsediments (e.g. Sweerts et al, 1989; Wang et al, 2001; Stief et al, 2005).  \n2.2.1. Needle-type optodes \nOxygen optodes, largely utilising phosphorescence based methods, have long been \nused in the fields of clinical science and environmental monitoring. Photochemical \nand physical properties of probes and polymers were recently reviewed by Amao \n(2003). Fibre-optic O2 microsensors (microoptodes) were first developed for use in \nsediments by Klimant et al (1995). Oxygen optodes use the ability of O2 to \ndynamically quench fluorescence. An O2 sensitive dye, immobilized in a polymer, is \nformed at the tip of an optic fibre. The dye, which consists of a molecule containing \nruthenium, absorbs light at a wavelength of 450 nm and maximally emits light at a \nwavelength of 610 nm. The fluorescent light, that is returned through the fibre optic \nand measured, is inversely related to the concentration of O2. The practical advantage \nof optodes over microelectrodes is their robustness and relatively easy fabrication \n(Klimant et al, 1995). The optode is typically constructed from a multimode \n 13 \nsilica\/silica step index fibre with a core diameter of 100 \u00b5m surrounded by a cladding \nof 125 \u00b5m thickness. The fibre is placed into an injection needle to improve \nmechanical stability. The system can be optically isolated by the application of a \nblack silicon layer over the polymer dye layer. Final tip diameters are within the \nrange 30-50 \u00b5m, with the size being limited by the minimum required intensity of the \nexcitation light (Klimant et al, 1995). Strongly tapered fibres reduce excitation light \nto unacceptable levels (Glud et al, 1999). The optoelectrical system that is coupled \nwith the device is described in Klimant et al (1995) and Glud et al (1999).  \n2.2.2. Performance characteristics \nAs O2 optodes do not consume the analyte, the signal does not depend upon the flow \nvelocity. However, response times are in the range 5-30 s, depending upon the \nthickness of the optically active and insulating layers. Microelectrodes are the \npreferred choice where a response time of <2 seconds is required (Glud et al, 1999). \nInterference tests by Klimant et al (1995) showed further advantages compared to \nmicroelectrodes. Optode signal strengths are unaffected by electromagnetic fields, \nhigh concentrations of sulphide and CO2, changes in salinity, pH variations, or high \nconcentrations of heavy metals. Optodes also provide long-term signal stability and a \ngood shelf- life (typically >6 months) (Klimant et al, 1995). High pressures can have \nthe effect of decreasing the quenching efficiency of the optode. O2 sensitivity at 200 \natm was found to be 8% lower than at 1 atm and 20% lower at 600 atm pressure \n(Glud et al, 1999).  \nUnlike O2 microelectrodes, the needle optode gives a non-linear calibration. \nHowever, the calibration can be linearized by means of a modified Stern-Volmer \nequation (Klimant et al, 1995). The intensity of luminescence is strongly temperature \ndependent and changes with water depth. Therefore, calibration should ideally be \nperformed under deployment conditions (Glud et al, 1999). Generally, a two-point \ncalibration is implemented by performing a Winkler titration on sampled bottom \nwaters and using the optode data from the anoxic zone within the sediment \n(Wenzh\u00f6fer et al, 2001).  \nBoth Wenzh\u00f6fer et al (2001) and Glud et al (1999) obtained consistent O2 profiles in \nmarine sediments using both microoptodes and microelectrodes deployed in situ \n 14 \nusing benthic landers. Variability between optode and electrode profiles at these sites \nwas no greater than the variability during multiple deployments of microelectrodes at \na single site (e.g. Reimers et al, 1986). Wenzh\u00f6fer et al (2001) deployed \nmicrooptodes at 0.5 cm intervals, to sediment depths of up to 40 cm, demonstrating \nthat the depth to which these sensors can be deployed is significantly greater than the \nmaximum for fine-tipped microelectrodes.  \n2.3.1. Planar (2D) optodes \nPlanar O2 optodes, that were first used in sediments by Glud et al (1996), use similar \noptical principles to those for the needle type optodes, except that the O2 quenchable \nfluorophore dissolved in the polymer is applied as a thin layer (10 \u00b5m) onto a \ntransparent 175 \u00b5m thick support foil. The total optode thickness after application of \nan optical insulation layer is 205 \u00b5m. These dimensions are relatively arbitrary and a \nrange of thicknesses of the optical sensor layer and support foil can be used. In the \nearly work, the planar optode was then mounted onto a small frame of transparent \nPlexiglas, which was in turn mounted with transparent silicon onto the interior glass \nof an aquarium (Glud et al, 1996). Illumination can be provided by a halogen lamp \n(Glud et al, 1996) or an LED array (Wenzh\u00f6fer and Glud, 2004), coupled with an \nexcitation filter. The luminescent light is collected by a charged coupled device \n(CCD) camera after being filtered to remove any reflected light from the excitation \nsource. Measurements can be based on either fluorescence intensity or lifetime (time-\ndomain) measurements. The measuring signal using the fluorescence lifetime \napproach is independent of the absolute fluorescence and thus is a more robust \nparameter (K\u00f6nig et al, 2005). Frequently the shark-fin approach to fluorescence \nlifetime of Hartmann et al (1997) is applied. Using this approach the ratio between \nthe sensor signal in excited and nonexcited states is calculated during well-defined \npulsing of the excitation light (Glud et al, 2001). Spatial resolution of the technique \nwas 26 \u00b5m after data processing (Glud et al, 1996). Sediment profile imaging (SPI) \nphotographic cameras housed in wedge-shaped Plexiglas chambers, for the in-situ \nstudy of organism-sediment interactions, were presented by Rhoads and co-workers \nin the early 1970 s (Rhoads and Young, 1970; Rhoads and Cande, 1971). Optodes \nusing a similar construction have been successfully deployed (e.g. Glud et al, 2001).   \n 15 \n2.3.2. Performance characteristics \nThe performance of the planar optode, in terms of interferences and optical \nbehaviour, is similar to that of the needle optode, as the design chemistry and physics \nare the same. However, the 2D nature of the system introduces some unique \nlimitations. Large variations in the response between different locations within the \nplane can be caused by both non-uniformity in the thickness of the \npolymer\/fluorophore layer and the distribution of the silicon sealant used to affix the \nassembly to the aquarium glass. Steady fluorescence response measurements are most \nsensitive to sensor heterogeneity. Fluorescence lifetime or ratiometric approaches can \nminimise or eliminate such problems. Calibrating all pixels individually, which can \nbe performed automatically, overcomes sensor heterogeneity and greatly improves \nthe fidelity of the 2D images (Oguri et al, 2006). It is also recognized that the planar \nsurface may affect the hydrodynamic conditions at the sediment-water interface (Glud \net al, 1999). The thickness of the DBL may be increased and horizontal diffusion into \nor from the depth plane may result in the observation of a non-linear DBL gradient \n(Glud, personal communication). A modelling based assessment of the effect of DBL \nthickness on benthic mineralization and O2 distributions has recently been undertaken \n(Glud et al, 2007). Viollier et al (2003) recommend avoiding the use of planar \noptodes for DBL studies in hydrodynamically active systems. Wenzh\u00f6fer and Glud \n(2004) have recognized that there is a possibility that invertebrate fauna may prefer to \nestablish themselves adjacent to a solid surface in order to reduce O2 consumption \nand to gain protection against predators. While this characteristic simplifies studies of \nthe effects of fauna on O2 distributions, it suggests that caution should be exercised in \nrelating the information to faunal populations.  \nThe system has been adapted for incorporation into both on-line (Glud et al, 2001) \nand autonomous (Glud et al, 2005) benthic landers. Oguri et al (2006) have \nsuccessfully deployed a planar optode system using a UV sensitive fluorophore \nincorporating platinum, which enables higher resolution analysis in low pO2 \nenvironments. Planar O2 optodes have been used to measure uptake rates associated \nwith burrows (Polerecky et al, 2006) and to study photosynthetic sediments \n(Frederiksen and Glud, 2006; Fenchel and Glud, 2000).  \n 16 \nGlud et al (2001) assessed the potential effect of particle smearing, during \ndeployment of the wedge shaped probe, on the O2 distribution. Fluorescent particles \nwere deposited at the sediment surface before insertion. No fluorescence from this \nsource was detected at depth in the sediment, indicating that any smearing effect was \nof minor importance in the silty sediment tested. However, the study recognized that \nsmearing is likely to be sediment specific and exacerbated in sediments where \nmechanical forcing of obstacles, such as shell fragments, occurs.  \n2.4. Evidence for microenvironments from microscale O2 studies \nThe majority of microscale studies of O2 in sediments are not aimed at investigating \nthe geochemistry of microniches. Rather, the focus is usually on measuring diffusive \nfluxes and identifying O2 behaviour due to biological activity, particularly in \nmicrobial mats and around feeding tubes and burrows. Evidence for the widespread \nexistence of burrows in sediments, both in the oxic zone and at greater depths, is \nprovided by numerous microelectrode profiles (Glud et al, 1994; Reimers, 1987; \nWenzh\u00f6fer et al, 2001; and J\u00f8rgensen et al, 2005). Studies at the 100-\u00b5m scale \nusually identify burrows with 10-100 data points, demonstrating the usefulness of \nmicrosensors in clearly quantifying solute patterns at and around such structures.   \nIn some cases, where several microsensors have been deployed together at one site, \nthey have demonstrated the heterogeneity of the sediment by showing a significant \nvariability between the profiles, both in terms of the penetration depth and profile \ngradients (e.g. Reimers et al, 1986). However, due to the continuous flux of O2 into \nthe sediment, it may be difficult to identify microenvironments that comprise an \norganic matter particle with an anoxic centre. The identification of such niches would \nrequire the electrode to penetrate close to the centre of the particle during the \nmeasurement. Anoxic niches within the oxic zone, created by dead organisms within \nshells (due to reduced O2 penetration by decreased diffusion), will not be measured, \nas the shells will break the electrode or at least be displaced by it. Anoxic microniches \nhave been observed using O2 planar optodes in the oxic zone (Glud et al, 2005).  \nProfiles of microelectrode measurements illustrated in Wenzh\u00f6fer et al (2001) at \nSouthern Atlantic sites (Figure 4) and in Koschorreck et al (2003) in a German acidic \nmining lake, show several sharp O2 minima within otherwise regular profile shapes. \n 17 \nThis suggests that there may be microniches of reactive organic matter that locally \ndeplete O2 due to higher oxidation rates.   \nAccording to a spherical model of O2 consumption under deep-sea conditions \n(Jahnke, 1985), depletion of O2 within the centre of a microniche of reactive organic \nmaterial will require one or more of the following conditions: a large diameter ( 5 \ncm), a fast O2 consumption rate or a slow internal diffusivity. As, in deep-sea \nsediments, particles of diameters greater than 5 cm are unlikely to exist, microniches \ncharacterized by O2 minima are likely to arise through a combination of the latter two \nconditions. The particle size necessary to create an anoxic microniche will not only be \ndependent upon the above factors, but also on the O2 concentration surrounding the \nparticle (e.g. J\u00f8rgensen, 1977). Sochaczewski et al (2008) modelled, in 3D, the \nbehaviour of O2, NO3- and sulphide at spherical microniches with a range of \ndiameters, positioned just below the sediment surface (centre of niche positioned at \n2.5 mm below the sediment water interface). Sulphide was generated in niches as \nsmall as 2.5 mm diameter under the modelled conditions.  \nThe nature of the particle may also affect microniche formation. Alldredge and Cohen \n(1987) found that O2 depletion in a large crustacean faecal pellet (6.2 mm long) could \noccur just 100 \u00b5m below the surface of the pellet when the peritrophic membrane \nremained intact. The bacterial population per volume was also found to be \nsignificantly larger within this environment than in marine snow particles. O2 \ndepletion in marine snow and other faecal pellets ranged from 6-45% in dark \nconditions. Settling particles, particularly in shallow seas and continental margins, \nmay also deplete O2 from the sea floor (Alldredge and Cohen, 1987). Biological \nmixing of these particles into the sediment, together with direct faecal deposition \nwithin the sediment oxic zone, is likely to lead to the production of sub-oxic or \nanoxic microniches. The duration of the anoxia within microniches occupying the \noxic zone may be unlikely to exceed 2.5 days, as Alldredge and Cohen (1987) found \nlittle or no O2 depletion in faecal pellets of this age or older.  \nSub-surface features should be considered in any calculations of sedimentary O2 \nbudgets and mineralization rates. Diffusion across burrow walls, which can be \nconsidered as secondary interfaces (e.g. K\u00f6nig et al, 2005), can significantly affect \n 18 \nthese estimates. The O2 distribution and temporal scales in burrow \nmicroenvironments and associated distributions of protozoa have been investigated in \na marine sediment using microelectrodes (Fenchel, 1996; 1996a). Planar optodes \nwere used by Wenzh\u00f6fer and Glud (2004) to show that O2 penetration depths of 2-3 \ncm in the presence of fauna, compared to a few millimetres in their absence, were \nattributable to irrigation by polychaetes. This study and that of K\u00f6nig et al (2005) \nobserved plumes of suboxic waters just above the sediment surface because of \nexpulsion of water from burrows by benthic fauna. Within the sediment Oguri et al \n(2006) identified sporadic depletion and recovery of O2 concentrations at the oxic-\nanoxic interface, which may be caused by respiration of benthic foraminifera. These \nfeatures had peak apparent O2 consumption rates of ~20 \u00b5M min-1 and were observed \nover minute time-scales. Methods of estimating O2 fluxes, incorporating faunal \nburrow O2 concentration data from optodes, have been developed (Wenzh\u00f6fer and \nGlud, 2004). Peak uptake rates of ~5.3 mmol m-2 h-1, observed at the onset of \ndarkness, decreased to less than half the peak rate just before sunrise. These \nobservations were attributed to a distinct diel pattern in faunal activity.   \nCameras incorporated onto benthic landers have, for decades, identified significant \nmicrotopography in oceanic sediments (see the excellent compilation of images by \nHeezen and Hollister, 1971). Many of the study sites reviewed here have employed \nbenthic cameras (e.g. Wenzh\u00f6fer et al, 2001; J\u00f8rgensen et al, 2005). This imaging can \nallow better estimation of the sediment-water interface when deploying sediment-\npenetrating probes.  \n3. Other optodes \nThe construction of optodes to measure components other than O2 usually only \ndiffers in the frequency of the excitation light and the chemical used as the \nfluorophore. The measurement approach (ratiometric or time-domain) is usually \ndictated by the available fluorophore. This section will therefore only report the \nanalyte specific detail of other optodes.  \nMicroelectrodes for pH and pCO2 have been used extensively in the study of \nsedimentary geochemistry. A significant proportion of pH electrode use in sediments \nhas been dedicated to co-analysis with another component to determine a species not \n 19 \ndirectly measurable, such as carbonate for calcite saturation and calculation of total \nsulphide from S(-II) (e.g. Cai et al, 1995; M\u00fcller and Stierli, 1999; respectively). As \nstudies of microenvironments with pH and pCO2 probes have exclusively used \noptodes, microelectrodes for these components are not considered further in this \nreview.  \n3.1.1. pH optode \nA planar pH optode was first reported by Hulth et al (2002). It used a HPTS (8-\nhydroxypyrene 1, 3, 6, trisulphonic acid trisodium salt) fluorophore immobilized by \nsorption onto a cellulose acetate optode foil. HPTS has the advantage of operating in \nthe visible range and having a large Stokes shift separating the excitation (405\/450 \nnm) and emission (520 nm) frequency maxima. The dual excitation nature of the \nfluorophore was used to calculate pH ratiometrically. The fluorescence response of \nthe immobilized HPTS to increased sample pH is sigmoidal, reflecting the titration of \nthis weak organic acid. This ratiometric detection largely eliminates any signal \nvariation caused by non-uniformity in the distribution of HPTS on the foil (Hulth et \nal, 2002). Zhu et al (2005), who used an alternative membrane for the support foil \n(covalent immobilization onto PVA membrane), established that the ratiometric \nresponse is independent of temperature changes. Excitation and emission frequency \nmaxima of their alternate foil were found to be 506\/428 nm and 540 m respectively. \nAn optode with an alternative fluorophore, utilising time domain dual-lifetime \nreferencing (Liebsch et al, 2001), was developed by Stahl et al (2006) and deployed \nin a photosynthetic marine sediment. The spatial resolution for the pH optode \nmeasurements in all studies is approximately 50 \u00d7 50 \u00b5m, using sensors with areas up \nto 225 cm2.  \n3.1.2. Performance characteristics \nThe sensor response time for the cellulose acetate supported HPTS was estimated to \nbe less than five seconds. Zhu et al (2005), using a PVA support, measured the \nresponse time for a two unit pH change to be <5 mins to reach complete stability. \nOptodes using both support materials were deployed for a period of over 50 days \nwithout any significant changes to the calibration. Shelf life is up to three years when \nthe sensor membrane is refrigerated (Zhu et al, 2006). The sensor foils are \ntransparent, allowing visual inspection or photography of the sediment and any \n 20 \nburrow structures, but care must be taken to ensure optical isolation, which is \nnormally accomplished by measuring under dark or low light conditions.  \nDue to the sigmoidal calibration, the sensor has the greatest sensitivity close to the \npKa of the immobilized HPTS (Hulth et al (2002), pKa of 6.4; Zhu et al (2005) pKa of \n7.06). The more the pH deviates from this value the greater the uncertainty, due to \nreduced signal to noise ratios, illustrating the advantage of the fluorophore used by \nZhu et al (2005) for measurements in marine sediments. However, the sensor \ndeveloped by Hulth et al (2002) has been deployed at pH ranges typical of marine \nenvironments without problems, consistent with the pKa of HPTS being more suited \nto the lower pH ranges found in sediments as opposed to overlying seawater. \nMeasurements agreed well with those obtained using pH electrodes and response is \nmaintained in the presence of NH4+, Fe2+, Mn2+ and sulphide in both oxic and anoxic \nconditions. The time-domain sensor developed by Stahl et al (2006) has a somewhat \nhigher pKa of ~8.3. Photobleaching of the area of pH indicator that was above the \nsediment-water interface reduced the sensitivity of that area of the probe by 7% (at \npH 8.1) compared to pre-incubation calibrations. However, the calibration curve for \nthe area of the sensor in the sediment remained constant for over three days. This \nprobe was recommended for studies within pH ranges of 7.3 to 9.3 (Stahl et al, 2006).  \n3.2.1. pCO2 optodes \nThe recently developed pCO2 optode film uses the pH fluorophore HTPS combined \nin a cocktail with tetraoctylammonium cation (TOA+) and tetraoctylammonium \nhydroxide (TOAOH). The sensor film is coated with a gas permeable silicon \nmembrane (Zhu et al, 2006a). As with the pH optode, the pCO2 system uses the ratio \nof fluorescence intensities (emission maxima 515 nm) following dual excitation \n(maxima 405\/475 nm). Resolution is comparable to the pH optode. The sensor in this \ninitial study was optimized for concentrations up to 20 matm. Typical concentrations \nfrom the Long Island Sound (USA) site were ~0.8 matm for overlying water and ~18 \nmatm for the peak sediment value.  \n3.2.2. Performance characteristics \nThe 90% response time of the optode for an increase from zero to five matm was 1.5 \nmins. Response was found to be consistent over hundreds of pCO2 transition cycles. \n 21 \nWhen the sensor foil is stored refrigerated and sealed, response remains stable for at \nleast several months. Response was unaffected by pH (over the range 2-12), NH3, or \nO2. Interference from hydrogen sulphide at concentrations of less than 20 \u00b5M was \nnegligible. Due to the reversible properties of these sensors, prolonged deployment \ntimes can be achieved, allowing measurement of temporal changes occurring over \ndays or weeks. Zhu et al (2006a) deployed a pCO2 optode for several weeks with no \ndegradation in sensor foil properties. Deployment of pH and pCO2 optodes either in-\nsitu or in freshwater sediments has yet to be reported.  \n3.3. Evidence for microenvironments from pCO2 and pH optodes \nThe 2D planar nature of optodes makes these sensors ideal for the study of solute \ndistributions around polychaete worm burrows in sediments. Sharp pH gradients have \nbeen observed across burrow-wall\/sediment interfaces (Figure 5), with a drop of 1.5 \npH units over 1.1 mm observed by Hulth et al (2002) for a active Nemertea burrow. \nData from occupied burrows of Nepthys incisa and Nereis succinea showed that the \npH at the body surfaces of the worms can have large interspecies variations, with the \npH adjacent to N. incisa having a typically lower pH (>1 pH unit) than the overlying \nwater, while for N. succinea it was indistinguishable from the pH of the overlying \nwater (Zhu et al, 2006). The large pH and redox gradients across irrigated burrow \nwalls may affect the distribution of sorbed sediment components. The effect of \nsediment disturbance (including bioturbation and resuspension) on the sorption and \npartitioning of metals, organic and organometallic contaminants has been recently \nreviewed (Eggleton and Thomas, 2004).  \nZhu et al (2006) observed that a region of lower pH (compared to the burrow and the \nsurrounding sediment) began to form almost immediately adjacent to the area \nirrigated by N. succinea. This region of lower pH may be due to the supply of O2 \ngenerated as a consequence of irrigation by the worm. The zone of low pH re-\nequilibrated to that of the surrounding sediment within approximately two days when \nthe animal vacated the burrow. In contrast, abandoned burrows of N. incisa, which \nwere subsequently infilled or collapsed, exhibited a substantially lower pH and \nelevated pCO2 than the surrounding sediment. These features dissipated within \napproximately one week (Zhu et al, 2006; 2006a). They were attributed to elevated \nmicrobial activity associated with the possible introduction of reactive organic matter \n 22 \nto the burrow, such as mucus secretions or faecal material, and the formation of \nenergetically favourable oxidants (Fe and Mn oxides) within the burrow wall or \nintroduced as the burrow becomes infilled (Hulth et al, 2002; Zhu et al, 2006a).  \nThe decay of a N. Succinea body at 10 cm depth was examined over a one-week \nperiod (Zhu et al, 2006). On day one a region of low pH ( 5.9) was centred on the \nbody. On day two the pH at the centre of the body increased slightly and rapid \ndiffusion of protons into the surrounding sediment was observed. By day five the pH \ndistribution had equalized with the surrounding sediment. These data suggest that \nmicroniches created by decaying fauna in anoxic sediment may be short lived. \nLocalized decreases in pH associated with microniche activity were also identified by \nHulth et al (2002).  \n4. Diffusive gel based devices for microscale measurements  \nTechniques that allow in situ sampling of porewaters, while limiting the disturbance \nof the overall system, have been developed over past decades. Peepers (dialysis \nsamplers; e.g. Hesslein, 1976) have been used for many years as an alternative to core \nextrusion\/centrifugation or whole core squeezing. Resolution is generally constrained \nby the dimensions of the sampling windows. The highest resolution peeper used to \ndate was a system deployed to study, in 2D, the effects of burrows on filterable \nreactive phosphorus fluxes within and from sediment porewater. However, spatial \nresolution was limited to 9 mm, due to the diameter of the cell (7 mm) and the \ndistance between cells (2 mm; Lewandowski et al, 2002; 2007). Improving the \nresolution will be limited by the challenges of small scale fabrication. Developments \nin gel-based techniques, have allowed the high-resolution analysis of many solutes in \nsediment porewaters at mm and sub-mm scale.  \n4.1.1. Diffusive equilibration in thin-films \nDiffusive equilibration in thin-films (DET; Davison et al, 1991) utilises a \npolyacrylamide hydrogel (95% water) typically less than one mm thick, housed in a \nplastic assembly with a window on one side. A 0.45 \u00b5m membrane filter acts as a \nprotective cover for the gel. The device allows solutes in the water of the gel to \nequilibrate with the adjacent porewater so that concentrations in the gel and porewater \nbecome equal. Equality of concentrations has been confirmed experimentally for \n 23 \nmajor components and nutrients, but not for all trace metals. Deployment times are \ntypically 24 hrs. Davison et al (1994) suggested that leaving the probe in place for \nthis length of time may minimise the effect of disturbances caused by deployment \n(such as particle smearing). Although, depending on the diffusion layer thickness, \ntimes approaching a day are usually required to assure complete equilibrium (>95%), \nthe concentrations measured by DET in sediments reflect most faithfully the \nconcentration within the porewater during the final few hours of deployment (Harper \net al, 1997).  \nThis technique was first used in sediments for measuring dissolved iron (Davison et \nal, 1991). After deployment, the iron was immobilized through oxidation and \nhydrolysis by immersing the probe in sodium hydroxide solution. The gel was then \ndried and analysed directly by proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE). Other workers \nhave used quick slicing of the gel, followed by back equilibration of the slices into \nMilli-Q water or NaCl solution (e.g. Mortimer et al, 1988). Fones et al (1998) used \n2M nitric acid as the eluent. The technique has been applied at one millimetre \nresolution for a large range of major ions and trace elements (in order of earliest use), \nMn and Fe (Davison et al, 1994), NO3-, SO42-, (Krom et al, 1994), NH4+, alkalinity, \nCO2 , Ca, Cl, Br (Mortimer et al, 1998), Mg, K (Zhang et al, 1999), Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, \nZn (Yu et al, 2000), U, Re, Mo (Morford et al, 2003), Fe(II) (colorimetric; Jezequel et \nal, 2007) . Docekalova et al (2002) showed in laboratory tests that DET probes could \nbe used for the simultaneous determination of many different analytes using the same \nprobe (at least 19 elements).   \n4.1.2. Performance characteristics \nThe spatial resolution at which DET provides an accurate record of porewater \nchemistry is a function of both the diffusional relaxation during equilibration in the \nsediment and of the diffusional relaxation time between removal of the probe and \nfixation. Diffusional relaxation, which refers to the tendency of ions in the gel to \ndiffuse from regions of high to low concentration (Davison et al, 1991), is the most \nsignificant limitation to DET resolution. The resolution at which fidelity of \nmeasurement is preserved when a single piece of 1 mm thick gel is used cannot be \nimproved appreciably beyond the one millimetre used in many of the above studies. \nThe time dependence of diffusional relaxation has been modelled by Davison et al \n 24 \n(1994) and Harper et al (1997). For example, the apparent concentration at a one \nmillimetre wide peak, measured using a 0.4 mm thick (unconstrained) gel, will be \nreduced to ~75% of the actual peak porewater concentration after a relaxation time of \nten minutes (Harper et al, 1997).   \nTo improve resolution by preventing lateral diffusion, a DET probe where the gel \nwas constrained within small compartments was developed (Fones et al, 1998). The \nconstrained probe consisted of a ladder of laser cut 200 \u00b5m wide compartments, each \n2 mm long. Gel compartments were spaced at 200 \u00b5m vertical intervals, giving a \nvertical resolution of 400 \u00b5m. Three ladders were cut onto the single probe, with the \ncentre column being offset by 200 \u00b5m depth to the other columns. This allowed the \nentire depth range of the probe to be analysed at 200 \u00b5m intervals. Polyacrylamide \ngels with a non-swelling composition were used to fill the thin compartments.  \nDET has been successfully deployed in freshwater, estuarine and marine sediments \n(see above references), 2D data has also been achieved by fixing analytes within the \ngel (e.g. Shuttleworth et al, 1999) and using colorimetric approaches (e.g. Jezequel et \nal, 2007).   \n4.2.1. Diffusive gradients in thin-films \nDiffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) was first developed by Davison and Zhang \n(1994) as a method to determine trace metal concentration in solutions, but was soon \nused for the measurements of metals in sediments (Zhang et al, 1995). Fick s First \nLaw of Diffusion is used to calculate the concentration in the exposure solution from \nthe measured mass of analyte bound to a binding layer placed behind a layer of \npolyacrylamide diffusive gel of known thickness. Several binding layers have been \ndeveloped for a large range of analytes (see recent reviews by Davison et al, 2007; \nWarnken et al, 2007).  \nBinding layers are formed by either adding a solid component to a gel before casting \nand curing, or precipitating a solid directly in the gel. Two binding layers have been \nused for sub-mm resolution analysis. Suspended particulate reagent iminodiacetate \n(SPR-IDA) has a bead size of 0.2 \u00b5m and has a high affinity for many metals and \ndivalent cations. Gels that contain homogeneous distributions of binding components \n 25 \ncan be analysed at high-resolution by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass \nspectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) or PIXE. This approach was first used by Davison et al \n(1997) to provide a 2-dimensional image of Zn, Fe, Mn and As(III) in a microbial mat \nand underlying sediment. The other binding phase used for sub-mm analysis is silver \niodide (AgI) embedded in a gel (Teasdale et al, 1999). This initially pale yellow layer \nbecomes grey-black when the AgI reacts with sulphide to form black silver sulphide \n(Ag2S). The density of the colour change, which can be related to concentration, can \nbe analysed using a flat bed scanner and computer software. Further advancements of \nthis technique have yielded a more homogeneously distributed binding phase \nprecipitated within the gel (Devries and Wang, 2003), and analysis by LA-ICP-MS \nhas been performed (Widerlund and Davison, 2007). Jezequel et al (2007) have \nsuccessfully used a reaction with a PVC film within a DGT-type device to estimate \ndissolved sulphide species.  \n4.2.2. Performance characteristics \nIf porewaters are effectively buffered by rapid resupply from a local source, such as a \ndesorbing solid phase, the DGT measured flux can be quantitatively interpreted as a \nconcentration (Davison et al, 1997). Quantitative interpretation in terms of the \nconcentration in the porewaters is also possible if there is no supply from solid phase \nto solution. In practise there is usually some solid phase resupply and quantitative \ninterpretation in terms of concentration is more complicated. The differences between \nDET and DGT data is illustrated by profiles from Fones et al (2001), where Fe and \nMn peaks measured by DGT were three times more pronounced than the peaks at the \nsame depth measured by DET. Dynamic models of the DGT sediment system that \nincorporate the kinetics of metal exchange induced by the DGT device have been \ndeveloped (Harper et al, 1998; 1999; 2000; Sochaczewski et al, 2007). Although \nthese models were verified for saturated soils (Ernstberger et al, 2002), they have yet \nto be tested fully in sediments. However, the dependence of the resupply on diffusive \ngel thickness has been experimentally examined (Zhang et al, 1995; Naylor et al, \n2006) and cases of deficient supply were considered (Zhang et al, 2002). Generally \nthe DGT measurement is best treated as an assessment of the solute that can be \nlocally supplied in response to a perturbation. A local peak in the signal indicates a \nlocal elevation in the concentration in the porewaters or a locally increased supply \nfrom the solid phase. \n 26 \nLack of localized DGT maxima at depth in homogenized sediment, suggests smearing \neffects are not significant (Zhang et al, 2002; Tankere-Muller et al, 2007). The effects \nof solution composition and deployment times on the measurement of trace metals \nhave been investigated (Gimpel et al, 2001) and specific performance characteristics \nfor the SPR-IDA binding phase have been assessed (Warnken et al, 2004).  \n4.3. Evidence for microenvironments from diffusive gel studies \nMeasurements with the constrained DET probe revealed a double maxima for Fe(II) \nin a freshwater lake sediment (Fones et al, 1998). Potential biogeochemical \nexplanations are that the feature is caused by microbially mediated reduction of \nnitrate by Fe(II) or that there is horizontal banding of labile organic material. \nHowever, the possibility that the features are a sampling artefact is not ruled out. The \ndoublet was resolved by multiple data points at 400-\u00b5m resolution, but the smaller of \nthe two maxima was only resolved by one data point at one millimetre resolution. The \ndata clearly illustrated that coarser resolution has a tendency to overestimate peak \nwidth and underestimate peak height.  \nMetals were measured at 100-\u00b5m resolution in a contaminated freshwater sediment \noverlain by a microbial mat using DGT with an SPR-IDA binding layer that was \nanalysed by PIXE (Davison et al, 1997). Peak mobilisation of Zn, Mn and As \noccurred at 0.8, 2.0 and 3.6 mm respectively below the interface with the mat, clearly \nshowing their control by different mechanisms. It was suggested that the Zn was \nreleased primarily from organic matter, while As release occurred with the reductive \nremobilisation of Fe.  \nMotelica-Heino et al (2003; 2003a) observed simultaneous release of metals and \nsulphide in a freshwater sediment. An SPR-IDA binding layer was placed behind a \nsilver iodide gel in a DGT sediment probe. Below the sediment water interface, dark, \nirregular spots of Ag2S were observed on the AgI gel, indicated local centres of \nelevated sulphide concentrations above a uniform background. These centres were \nattributed to the clustering of sulphate reducing bacteria, but this was not confirmed \nby biological analysis. By scanning a laser across the trace metal binding layer \nunderlying the sulphide binding gel and measuring the ablated material by ICP-MS, \ntrace metal concentrations were analysed at 100 \u00b5m resolution in a transect \n 27 \ncorresponding to one of the sulphide spots. Localized remobilisation of metals (Ni, \nCo, Fe and Mn) was observed at the site of elevated sulphide (Motelica-Heino et al, \n2003). Saturation indices (SI) of metal sulphide species were calculated for \nmicroniche concentrations. At the peak concentration, the SI indicated \nsupersaturation for all metals except Mn. Motelica-Heino et al (2003) proposed that \nsupersaturation at the site of the peak concentrations may be caused by the rate of \nproduction exceeding the rate of removal by precipitation. Elevated trace metal \nconcentrations associated with sulphide may be due to simultaneous remobilisation \nassociated with both sulphate and iron acting as electron acceptors for the oxidation \nof the microniche organic matter. Koretsky et al (2005) observed coexistence of \naerobic, Fe-, Mn- and sulphate-reducing bacteria within the upper 10 cm of a salt \nmarsh sediment that is subject to a large supply of organic matter and intense \nbioturbation. Coexistence of these bacteria suggests that within localized \nenvironments, oxidants may become limited, allowing processes with lower free \nenergy yields to occur successively.  \nThe study by Motelica-Heino et al (2003) provides evidence for the simultaneous \nrelease of metals and sulphide from microniches, and for the coexistence of local \nexcesses of labile organic matter, iron and sulphate reducing bacteria. This technique \nhas considerable potential to yield useful geochemical information, particularly as 2D \nmapping of sulphide and metal concentrations can be undertaken in the same \ncombined gel. In their evaluation of techniques for 2D imaging of trace metals by \nlaser ablation (LA)-ICP-MS, Warnken et al (2004a) showed, using a 500 \u00b5m spaced \nanalysis grid, that Co was heterogeneously distributed in two dimensions in a \nfreshwater sediment, whereas slicing into 1 x 15 mm strips averaged the data to a \nfeatureless line of almost constant concentration (Figure 6). Fones et al (2004) \nshowed localized centres (1-2 mm diameter) of Zn mobilisation in a marine sediment \nin their 2D images of Zn obtained using LA-ICP-MS at a resolution of 100 \u00d7 300 \u00b5m. \nIn these last two examples the DGT probes were deployed in situ using landers.  \nOther high-resolution studies using DGT have exploited Teasdale et al s (1999) \ndevelopment of a simple procedure for measuring sulphide in one or two dimensions \nby simply scanning the image. 2D images of sulphide obtained by Motelica-Heino et \nal (2003) and Devries and Wang (2003) in freshwater sediments showed dark spots of \n 28 \nelevated sulphide from 1 mm to >1 cm diameter superimposed on background \nsulphide signals. These sulphidic microniches were attributed to spatially discrete \naggregates of reactive organic matter with associated high populations of sulphate \nreducing bacteria. In microniche faecal pellets where the peritrophic membrane is \nintact, reduction may occur in the order O2, NO3  and SO42 , as Fe and Mn oxides are \neffectively excluded. This may result in some microniches in the anoxic zone being \nreduced almost exclusively by sulphate. Localized sulphide release was also evident \nin linear high-resolution profiles (Naylor et al, 2006). 2D data for DGT deployments \nin undisturbed freshwater cores, obtained by Widerlund and Davison (2007), showed \nthe proportion of microniche-related sulphide flux was 1-8% of the total net \nporewater flux of sulphide. Figure 7, illustrates data that can be extracted from DGT \nsulphide binding probes.  \n5. Sub-mm biological surveys \nMany methods, covering a range of scales and within different environments (marine \nand freshwater), have been used to assess the influence of benthic organisms (i.e. \nbioturbation and bioirrigation) on physical and chemical characteristics of sediments \n(a large body of this work was reviewed by Krantzberg, 1985). Developments in \nanalytical techniques (as detailed in previous sections) have led to the ability to study \nchemical behaviour at the exact location of defined features (e.g. inhabited or relic \nburrows). Other technological advancements have led to additional techniques with \nthe specific ability to visualise biological features at high-resolution. This section will \ncover three such techniques, mapping of relative enzyme activity, a resin based \nmethod for investigating sub-mm life positions and axial tomography of sediment \ncores for 3D visualisation of benthic structures.  \n5.1. Azo dye mapping of relative enzyme activity \nRogers and Apte (2003) presented a unique method for the sub-mm analysis of \nrelative enzyme activity in sediments. Enzyme substrates (naphthol AS) were loaded \nonto filter membranes that were attached to a plastic card to provide rigidity. \nEnzymes in contact with the membrane hydrolyse the substituted naphthol. This \nexposed membrane can then be developed in a diazonium salt solution, resulting in a \ncoloured precipitate where substrate hydrolysis occurs (Rogers and Apte, 2003). A \ndeployment time of 24 hrs was chosen to minimise the effects of any potential \n 29 \ndisturbance during probe insertion. In common with DGT AgI probes, the resulting \nimage can be analysed by computer-imaging densitometry. The scanned images can \nprovide high-resolution information (such as those shown in Figure 7 for the DGT \nsulphide binding phase), although numerical data extracted from these scans in the \ninitial study were one-dimensional and at the mm scale. Previous one-dimensional \nstudies using core slicing have been undertaken at one millimetre resolution or lower \n(e.g. Craven et al, 1986). How well measurements of relative esterase activity are able \nto predict general microbial activity is still unknown (Rogers and Apte, 2003). \nFurther work is therefore needed to establish whether microniches observed using this \ntechnique are related to zones of higher overall microbial activity.  \n5.2. Sub-mm life positions of benthic biota using the fluorescently labelled embedded \ncore (FLEC) technique \nBernhard et al (2003) presented a new technique to determine the life-positions of \nbenthic fauna, which combined the life position method developed by Bernhard and \nBowser (1996) with hot-knife microtomy (McGee-Russell et al, 1990). The FLEC \ntechnique involves perfusing several solutions\/liquids through a small core (1.5 cm \ndiameter and <10 cm long) as a pre-treatment, before a final perfusion of a liquid \nresin through the core, which is subsequently cured for a period of 12 hours to obtain \na solid core suitable for cutting (Bernhard and Bowser, 1996). Bernhard et al (2003) \nsuggest that the perfusion of several liquids through the core does not significantly \naffect the life positions of the biota of interest. The hot-knife method allows \nsectioning of cores into ~100 \u00b5m slices without sample loss. Depth profiles that were \n11 mm long were examined. Sections were analysed using a laser scanning confocal \nmicroscope (LSCM). Benthic fauna were then visually identified from the images. \nStudies of microbioirrigation have been undertaken using similar techniques (Pike et \nal, 2001)  \n5.3. Axial tomography of intact sediment cores \nX-radiography of sediments was first performed several decades ago (e.g. Hamblin, \n1962; Calvert and Veevers, 1962; Axelsson and H\u00e4ndel, 1972). Using this technique \nwith thin aquaria, animal burrows have been studied (e.g. Rhoads and Young, 1970; \nSchaffner et al, 2001). Perez et al (1999) established procedures for using axial \ntomography (computer-aided tomography; CT) for the study of benthic communities \n 30 \nin intact cores. The minimum axial slice thickness in this initial study was 1.5 mm. A \nrotating array of x-ray transmitters and receivers scans from all angles around a \nsample. Each voxel (pixel with a depth dimension) value will depend on x-ray \nattenuation related to material density, atomic number, and the principles of radiation \nmatter (Dufour et al, 2005). Thus, attenuation of x-rays can differentiate between \nsediment and water in benthic structures. Data from these scans have been used to \ndetermine the percentage space occupied by biogenic structures, gravel and organic \nmatter (Michaud et al, 2003; Mermillod-Blondin et al, 2003; Dufour et al, 2005; \nRosenberg et al, 2007). Linear (pixel) resolution in the above studies was in the range \n0.2 mm to 0.5 mm.  \n5.4. Microenvironments revealed by biological studies \nTwo-dimensional scans of esterase activity clearly showed niches of elevated activity \nin a sediment mesocosm at both sub-mm and mm scale (Rogers and Apte, 2003), but \nthe relationship between esterase activity and general microbial activity still requires \nevaluation.  \nCT scans of cores can show the production and destruction rates of biogenic \nmicroenvironments. Depth characteristics of such structures can be assessed and \nspatial distributions can be determined. The data can be used to assess the effect of \nthese structures on solute distributions and fluxes, both within, and from and to the \nsediment. An example of the images available is shown in Figure 8A. These \ntechniques also give the potential for assessing the impact of preferential burrowing \nof biota at planar surfaces by quantifying its significance. This type of information \nmay allow better quantification of solute patterns obtained by planar optodes and may \ngive more insight the mechanisms of microniches formation at the surface of DGT \ndevices.  \nBernhard et al (2003) investigated the sub-mm life positions of bacteria, protists and \nmetazoans in a Santa Barbara Basin sediment that contains a high bio-volume in the \nsurface centimetre. The study revealed much heterogeneity in both horizontal and \nvertical distributions of benthic fauna (shown in Figure 8B). Several features related \ndirectly to microenvironments. Large flagellate communities (flagellate swarms), \nwhich are zones of elevated carbon cycling, are thought to exist exclusively in anoxic \n 31 \nenvironments. They were observed at a depth of 0.2 mm where a weakly oxic \nenvironment is expected. It was estimated that there may be as many as 14 of these \nswarms per cm3, suggesting that they may exert a significant influence on whole \nsediment geochemical processes in surface sediment, in terms of turnover \nrates\/volumes, and yet still contribute to structuring chemical heterogeneity. Some \nmetazoans were found to occur in close proximity to anaerobes, which is unexpected \ndue to the opposing survival conditions of each organism (oxic and anoxic). Bernhard \net al (2003) suggest that this proximity may occur due to the niche conditions having \nsufficient O2 for respiration but not enough for O2 toxicity. The sporadic temporal O2 \ndepletion\/recovery cycles observed by Oguri et al (2006) using a planar optode, may \npotentially be associated with the life-positions of such biota. The possibility that \nthere is a symbiotic relationship between the organisms is not ruled out (Bernhard et \nal, 2003).  \n6. Assessment of progress and geochemical implications \nResults from the limited number of studies undertaken at the microscale suggest that \nour understanding of sedimentary diagenesis has been somewhat oversimplified by \nanalysis at a larger, spatially averaged, scale. All of the probes reviewed have, to \nvarying extents, revealed microniches. For example planar optodes have revealed \nniches of lower pH and depleted O2, DGT has revealed points of elevated trace metal \nand sulphide activity, and a life positions study has demonstrated that some biota may \nexist in heterogeneously distributed communities. However, interpretation of these \ndata in terms of sediment biogeochemistry is often difficult, as specific chemical or \nbiological drivers of these processes are not identified and the processes can \ngenerally only be related to one or two analytes. Microsensor techniques have \nenabled more precise measurements of diffusive boundary layers and when combined \nwith data from secondary interfaces, will provide a more accurate understanding of \nvariations in solute fluxes across the sediment-water interface. DGT data have \nrevealed double maxima in key redox components that would not have been resolved \nby lower scale measurements, suggesting that in many systems biogeochemical \nprocesses may be more complex than previously considered.    \n 32 \n6.1. Effects of benthic fauna \nData from planar optodes and O2 microprobes provide more details of the effects that \nbenthic biota exert on solute distributions in surface sediments, both in terms of \nspatial and temporal influences. This influence extends into the anoxic zone in the \nmajority of studies. The overall effect of burrows (the secondary interface) is largely \nto increase the effective interface between the sediment and the overlying water. The \namount of O2 available for organic matter (OM) degradation and reoxidation of \nreduced species is increased, and irrigation facilitates a more rapid efflux of solutes \nsuch as CO2 from the sediment. The large gradients of solutes across the secondary \ninterface have implications for high-order, pH-dependent processes, such as \nhydrolysis, or dissolution reactions. These large solute gradients may lead to extreme, \nspatial variations where localized chemistry will have little resemblance to mean \nvalues (Zhu et al, 2006).  \n6.2. Interpretation of microniche data \n6.2.1. Microniche distributions \nHeterogeneity within sediments is increased as a result of increased inter microniche \ndistance, slow transport and fast sinks (Harper et al, 1999a). Microniches can be \nregarded as finite zones where organic matter degrades at elevated rates, so if they are \nvery numerous their individual effects may not be observed. The sediment could be \nconsidered laterally homogeneous if the following conditions were met: no \nconcentration peaks exist in the horizontal plane, an even distribution of oxidants \noccurs across the plane and where benthic fauna are absent. In this case, the averaging \nscale represented in Figure 1 would be sufficient to describe the system. In practice, \nin sediments with significant populations of benthic fauna and an input of organic \ncarbon, microniches are likely to exist, with their density and distribution depending \nupon the faunal populations and the volume and spatial distribution of the organic \nmatter.  \n6.2.2. Assessment of compatibility of microniche data \nSo far, data revealing microniches are not always complementary. Optodes have \nidentified microniche activity attributed to elevated OM decomposition within the \noxic zone (e.g. Hulth et al, 2002; Glud et al, 2005), while DGT profiles identified \nelevated niches of trace metal activity within the same zone, but not at the sub-mm \n 33 \nscale (e.g. Fones et al, 2004). Published evidence of microniches using DGT has \neither not described the O2 conditions associated with the niche or has focussed on the \nsimultaneous release of sulphide and metals in anoxic environments. The lack of \ncongruent analysis makes it difficult to interpret these data in terms of specific \ngeochemical processes. If the data reviewed here were shown to be compatible, the \ndepleted O2\/lower pH observed by optodes and the elevated sulphide and trace metals \nobserved by DGT may allow calculation of the expected metal sulphide formation \nand indicate if these environments are important for long-term mineral formation. \nHowever, synthesis of the current data, obtained from deployments in a range of \nsedimentary environments, would be speculative at best.  \nThere is convincing evidence, from both the techniques reviewed here and other \nstudies at lower resolutions, that microenvironments caused by burrowing biota have \nsignificant effects on local solute distributions and fluxes to overlying water. \nHowever, evidence that discrete particles of organic matter (microniches), introduced \ninto the sediment by biota, affect large-scale or longer-term diagenetic processes or \nreaction rates is inconclusive. Further investigation on the distribution and frequency \nof microniches is required in order to estimate their cumulative effect on element \ndiagenesis and immobilisation\/remobilisation, including pollutant fate.  \n6.3. One- or two-dimensional data? \nTwo-dimensional data have the advantage of providing information about variations \nin processes occurring in both the horizontal and vertical planes simultaneously, \nallowing direct measurement of the dimensions of a feature where the chemical \ncomponent being measured differs from its background. If there is an associated \nphysical manifestation, such as a burrow, it can also be directly observed visually \nwhen transparent optodes are used. Planar probes are generally left in situ for \nextended periods (hours to weeks) to provide temporal data from optodes, to ensure \nequilibration with solutes in the porewaters when using DET and to allow analysis of \nlow concentrations of trace metals by DGT. This deployment time may be longer than \nthe typical lifespan of a microniche, so observation of microniche activity may only \nbe possible if bioturbation introduces fresh organic matter at the planar surfaces. As \nthere is a possibility of planar surfaces preferentially attracting burrowing organisms, \nthe prevalence of microenvironments may be over-estimated, with their observed \n 34 \ndistribution being unrepresentative of the bulk sediment. It is difficult to quantify the \neffect of benthic organisms on observed DGT or DET profiles, as no direct visual \nrecord is available. Needle type probes with short response times have the advantage \nof providing a measurement at a precise spatial location without (i) affecting the \ngeochemical nature of the surrounding sediment (ii) moderating the concentration of \nthe analyte or (iii) providing a surface substrate for biota. In theory, then, their \nrepetitive deployment to provide a grid of data should overcome some of the \nproblems of planar probes. However, needle probes are unlikely to give precise data \non the size of features, as they are unlikely to penetrate repeatedly their centres, or \nintersect edges at a precise 90\u00ba angle. As distributions of microniches are likely to be \nstochastic, many multiple deployments will be required to characterise them, \npotentially introducing substantial disturbance. Furthermore, needle probes may \ndirectly damage living organisms.  \n6.4. Future direction of microniche studies \nThere is a need for further data that covers a wider range of analytes. Given the \ntoolbox of high-resolution techniques, which have been used for studies that have \nnot reported microenvironments (Table 1), the capacity to expand knowledge in this \narea already exists. If microniches are known to account for a significant proportion \nof organic matter degradation, re-examination of the current understanding of some \naspects of sedimentary diagenesis (e.g. trace metal behaviour and fate) may be \nrequired. Reaction rates for processes occurring in microniches may be much greater \nthan comparable rates estimated for whole sediment . Moreover, DGT data have \ndemonstrated that the dynamics of processes occurring in microniches can cause \nlocalized supersaturation. The multi-G model for organic matter decomposition may \nhave its physical embodiment in microniches. If microniches were to account for only \none percent of the total available organic matter, but had rates 50 times that of the \nbulk material, the microniche activity would account for one-third of the C turnover \nof the whole system.  \nUse of probes capable of measuring only a single element increases the complexity of \nelucidating diagenetic behaviour. When there is small scale heterogeneity, data from \nseparate probes, even deployed as close as 1 cm apart, cannot be directly compared. \nTo provide a full picture of the biogeochemical processes operating at a micro scale, \n 35 \nprobes capable of simultaneous multi-species analysis will be required. Future \ndevelopments in probe design will need to incorporate this requirement. A number of \ntools already exist that fulfil these criteria but where microniches have not been \nidentified (Table 1). One such device, the multi-element voltammetric microelectrode \ndeveloped by Brendel and Luther (1995), has been deployed at high-resolution. A \nmicrobial mat was examined over ~2 mm at intervals up to 50 \u00b5m (for O2, Fe(II) and \nMn(II); Trouwborst et al, 2007). Deployment in intertidal salt marsh sediments at mm \nresolution has revealed small scale features (~cm scale). In this study the electrode \nwas used for quantifying O2, Fe(II), Mn(II), H2S, and detecting FeS(aq), and \ndissolved organic complexes of Fe(III) (Taillefert et al, 2007). The ability to provide \nspeciation information for some elements is an additional benefit of this technology. \nAlthough this probe will be subject to the same disadvantages as any electrode \n(discussed above), it is clearly a tool capable of providing useful geochemical \ninformation about microniches.  \nThe need for further studies of sediment systems at high resolution is clear. However, \nto date analysis tends to have focussed upon a limited number of analytes at specific \ngeographical locations. In order to gain fully from the methods reviewed here, other \nexisting technology and future developments, it would be beneficial if a range of \ntechniques were deployed at future investigation sites. This more complete \ninformation, coupled with co-analysis of multiple analytes at precisely the same \nlocation, may allow interpretation in terms of specific chemical or biological \ndiagenetic processes.     \nAcknowledgements \nAS was supported by NERC (NER\/S\/A\/2005\/13679).

Expected variations in porosity if measured at the specified scales (where scale \nrefers to the size of the sediment parcel being observed). The observations go from \nthe scale of a grain to that of an average measurement of a larger sediment sample. In \nthe central section variability is caused by sediment features such as burrows, benthic \norganisms, faecal pellets or hard-parts such as shells (the frequency of the features \nin this section will vary depending not only on the sediment properties but also the \ndepth within the sediment). The porosity begins at zero as the starting point is \narbitrarily set within a sediment grain. Modified from Boudreau (1997).  \nFigure 2: Copyright controlled \nFig. 2.
