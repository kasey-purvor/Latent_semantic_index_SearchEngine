INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years there has been a significant increase in\ncomputing power and storage which has lead to the devel-\nopment of finer grid tidal models covering larger geograph-\nical areas. Although initially the emphasis was on refin-\ning the grids in two\u2013dimensional (2D) vertically integrated\nmodels (for example the early shelf wide model of Flather\n(1976) compared with the recent finer grid models of Ver-\nboom et al. (1992); Gerritsen and Berentsen (1998); and\nregional models, Gjevik et al. (2006)) recently high resolu-\ntion three\u2013dimensional (3D) models have been developed\n(e.g. Davies and Aldridge (1993); Davies et al. (1997c,a,b);\nDavies and Hall (2000); Lee and Jung (1999); Young et al.\n(2000); Xing and Davies (2001)), requiring additional com-\nputational resources.\nIn early 3D models eddy viscosity was computed from\nthe flow field, but recently e.g. Davies and Jones (1990);\nLuyten et al. (1996); Davies and Hall (2000) turbulence en-\nergy closure models have been used to compute this param-\neter. The additional calculations required with a turbulence\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nEmail address: phh@pol.ac.uk (P. Hall).\nclosure model have also lead to an increasing demand in\ncomputational resources. Classically models were used to\nexamine only the M2 tidal constituent and its higher har-\nmonics namely M4 and M6. However, recently other tidal\nconstituents in particular S2, N2, K1, and O1 have been in-\ncluded in order to examine their spatial dependency. These\nadditional constituents are important in shallow water re-\ngions where the system is highly nonlinear. Since the to-\ntal level of turbulence depends upon these additional con-\nstituents and consequently if the benefits of using turbu-\nlence closure schemes are to be realised then these con-\nstituents need to be included. As finite difference grids be-\ncome finer, or a finite element model is used with a refined\ngrid in shallow water, then the importance of using a full\nset of tidal constituents increases.\nThe main problem of including a large number of con-\nstituents is that an harmonic analysis is required to sepa-\nrate out the various constituents, and also as we will show\nto take account of those produced by non\u2013linear interaction\nin shallow water. Based upon classical tidal theory Godin\n(1972) used to analyse elevation and current observations,\nin which there is significant noise due particularly to meteo-\nrological effects, this can require a long time series (often in\nexcess of a year) depending upon the constituents to be re-\nPostprint of article published in Applied Mathematical Modelling (2005) 29: 533\u2013552 20 July 2007\nsolved and the accuracy required. The computation of such\na long time series with a 3D fine grid model, covering both\nshallow and deep water (which restricts the time step), and\nincluding a turbulence closure scheme is significant. Con-\nsequently any reduction in the time series required to per-\nform the harmonic analysis and means of ensuring an ac-\ncurate solution from this analysis is a significant bonus in\nnumerical modelling both in terms of computer time, and\nmemory required to store and process time series at every\ngrid point for output.\nAlthough we are primarily concerned with the accuracy\nof the harmonic analysis of time series of data derived from\na fine grid three dimensional non\u2013linear model (since this is\na computationally expensive model) we will use a 2D non\u2013\nlinear model for illustrative purposes. In this paper a 2D\nmodel of the North West European Shelf together with syn-\nthetic time series produced by the addition of harmonics\nwith a given amplitude and phase are used to examine how\nlong a time series, and with what data interval, is required\nto perform an accurate harmonic analysis, particularly in\nshallow water regions. The synthetic time series is used in\naddition to the numerical model results since the number of\nharmonics contributing to the time series and in the subse-\nquent harmonic analysis can be exactly controlled. By this\nmeans the influence of including or excluding various con-\nstituents upon the accuracy of other constituents derived\nby harmonic analysis can be exactly determined. In the nu-\nmerical model the generation of constituents at frequencies\nother than the forcing frequency depends purely on location\n(deep or shallow water) and cannot be pre\u2013determined as in\nthe case of synthetic data. Also the analysis of the synthetic\ndata is a check that conclusions based on model output are\nnot a function of the model but depend only on analysis\nmethod. In the comparisons performed with the numerical\nmodel results the emphasis is on shallow water where bot-\ntom friction effects are particularly important and higher\nharmonics are produced. As we will show it is in these re-\ngions where there are problems in determining an accurate\nharmonic analysis, and hence if the benefits of using fine\ngrid models are to be realised, accuracy is required.\nIn many tidal models, calculations are performed with\nonly M2 tidal forcing and conclusions as to the accuracy of\nthe model are based on this single constituent calculation.\nThe effect of including additional constituents in particu-\nlar S2, N2, K1 and O1 upon the accuracy of the M2 tide in\nshallow water is also examined. In this paper the emphasis\nis on the harmonic analysis of elevations, although similar\nconclusions apply to currents derived from 3D models (e.g.\nDavies and Aldridge (1993); Davies et al. (1997c); Davies\nand Jones (1992, 1996); Davies et al. (1997a,b); Kwong\net al. (1997)). The form of the model is described in the next\nsection, with subsequent sections dealing with the tidal cal-\nculations, and means of determining an accurate harmonic\nanalysis.\n2. The hydrodynamic model\nThe two\u2013dimensional model used here covers the Euro-\npean shelf (Fig. 1), and hence a range of water depths from\nover 2000m to less than 10m. Since detailed plots of the\ndepth distribution in the model are given in Davies et al.\n(1997c) and Kwong et al. (1997) they will not be presented\nhere. Open boundary forcing, namely a radiation condition\nwith input at the K1, O1, M2, S2, and N2 frequencies is\nused to force the model. Any higher harmonics are gener-\nated by non\u2013linear interaction in shallow water, in particu-\nlar the non\u2013linear momentum advection terms, and bottom\nfrictional term.\nSince extensive details of the two dimensional model for-\nmulation can be found in the literature, and means of solv-\ning the equations (e.g. Davies et al. (1997c,a,b)) only es-\nsential details will be presented here.\nBoundary conditions took the form of a zero surface\nstress condition, while at the sea bed a quadratic friction\nlaw was applied. On closed boundaries, a no normal flow\ncondition was applied, while along open boundaries a radi-\nation condition namely,\nq = qT +\nc\nh\n\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6T (1)\nwas adopted, with q the normal component of depth mean\ncurrent, \u03b6 sea surface elevation, h water depth, c = (gh)1\/2\nwith g the acceleration due to gravity and\nqT =\nm\u2211\ni=1\nQicos(\u03c9it\u2212 \u03b3i) (2)\n\u03b6T =\nm\u2211\ni=1\nHicos(\u03c9it\u2212Gi) (3)\nIn these equations, \u03c9i denotes the speed of constituent i\nwithHi andQi the amplitude of tidal elevation and current,\nand Gi and \u03b3i, the phase.\n3. Tidal calculations\nIn a preliminary series of calculations the model was\nforced with only theM2 tide (Table 1), and an harmonic\nanalysis was performed using the M2 tide and its higher\nharmonics (Group A, Table 2), although subsequently\nGroups B, C and D (Table 2) were used. In later calcula-\ntions the model was forced with the O1, K1, N2, M2 and\nS2 tides (Table 1) and harmonically analysed using various\ngroups (namely E to G) of tidal constituents (Table 2).\nBy this means the influence of the choice of constituents\nused in the harmonic analysis method and the frequency\nof storing data (summarised in Table 3) upon the accuracy\nof the solution could be assessed. In addition to analysing\ndata at 10min and 60min intervals, in some cases data at\n30min intervals was analysed and results are discussed in\nthe text. Changes in the M2 tide due to the presence of\nadditional constituents could also be examined.\n2\nFig. 1. Finite difference grid of the shelf tidal model.\n3.1. Harmonic analysis of numerical model tides\ngenerated with M2 tidal forcing\nIn an initial calculation the model was forced at the M2\nperiod and tidal elevations over the whole domain were\nsaved at 10min intervals for a period of 25 days. The nature\nof the non\u2013linear terms in the hydrodynamic equations is\nsuch that besides generating a tidal residual, higher har-\nmonics of the tide at the M4, and higher frequencies are\nproduced particularly in shallow water. To examine the ac-\ncuracy of theM2 tide derived by harmonic analysis using\nvarious groups of constituents (Groups A to D in Table 2),\nthe time series was analysed in various ways, for a number\nof shallow and deep water sites (see later).\n3.1.1. Determination of a \u201dbenchmark\u201d solution\nIn this section we initially determine that the model can\nproduce an accurate M2, M4 and M6 tide in the region. To\nthis end output is saved at 10min intervals and the resulting\ntime series is analysed using the full set of tidal constituents\n(Group A in Table 2). This accurate analysis approach (see\nlater) yielded an accurate \u201dbenchmark\u201d solution that was\nused to check that the model was determining a physically\nrealistic tidal distribution. Initially we briefly examine the\nspatial distribution of the M2, M4, and M6 tides and check\ntheir accuracy at a number of locations. Subsequently us-\ning time series from Lerwick and Avonmouth we briefly de-\nscribe a method to check how long the model must be inte-\ngrated for to remove the effect of the initial conditions and\nensure that the harmonic analysis is independent of the in-\n3\nTide Period (\u25e6\/h) Boundary Forcing\nO1 13.943 Yes\nK1 15.041 Yes\n\u03bc2 27.968 No\nN2 28.440 Yes\n\u03bd2 28.512 No\nM2 28.984 Yes\nL2 29.528 No\nT2 29.959 No\nS2 30.000 Yes\nMN4 54.424 No\nM4 57.968 No\nMS4 58.984 No\nM6 86.952 No\n2MS6 87.968 No\nMm 0.544 No\nMSf 1.0159 No\nMf 1.0980 No\n2MS2 27.968 (see \u03bc2)\n2SM2 31.016 No\nMNS2 27.424 No\nMSN2 30.544 No\nTable 1\nSymbol and frequency of the various tidal constituents used to force\nthe model and in the analysis\n(A) M2, M4, M6, M8, M10, M12\n(B) M2, M4, M6\n(C) M2, M4\n(D) M2\n(E) M2, S2, N2, O1, K1, \u03bc2, MN4, M4, MS4, M6, \u03bd2, L2, T2\n(F) M2, S2, N2, O1, K1, \u03bc2, MN4, M4, MS4, M6\n(G) M2, S2, N2, O1, K1\nTable 2\nGroups of harmonics used in the analysis, with tidal constituents\nhaving frequencies shown in Table 1\nHarmonic Group of Time interval in\nanalysis method harmonics time series (min)\n1 A 10\n2 B 10\n3 C 10\n4 D 10\n5 A 60\n6 B 60\n7 C 60\n8 D 60\nTable 3\nRange of harmonic methods used to analyse the computed time series\nderived with M2 forcing\ntegration time period. In later sections by comparison to\nthe \u201dbenchmark\u201d solution we will examine how the M2, M4\nand M6 harmonics change when other analysis approaches\n(Table 3) are used and when other tidal constituents (i.e.\nO1, K1, N2, S2) are included.\nSince detailed and accurate co\u2013tidal charts are given else-\nwhere (Davies et al., 1997c; Kwong et al., 1997) and the co\u2013\ntidal charts computed with the present model are compara-\nble to these, only a brief discussion will be given here. The\nM2 co\u2013tidal chart (not presented) derived using method 1,\n(Table 3) shows amphidromic points in the Southern Bight\nof the North Sea and off the west coast of Denmark with\ndegenerate amphidromic points at the southern tip of Nor-\nway and south\u2013east of Ireland. The tidal distribution is in\ngood agreement with other cotidal charts based on mod-\nels and observations (Howarth and Pugh, 1983; Howarth,\n1990). A detailed comparison with a limited number of A\nclass gauges is shown in Table 4. (The A class gauges are\nhighly accurate gauges which have been used in other model\ncomparisons (Davies et al., 1997c,a,b)).\nThe computed M4 and M6 cotidal charts (not presented)\nshow that tidal amplitude increases in shallow water re-\ngions where the non\u2013linear terms are significant. These dis-\ntributions are in good agreement with those derived from\nother models (Davies et al., 1997c) and based on observa-\ntions (Howarth, 1990).\nAt shallow water ports such as Avonmouth and Heysham\nthe model significantly overestimates the M4 and M6 am-\nplitude, in part due to resolution problems. At other ports,\ngiven the model\u2019s limited resolution there is reasonable\nagreement. Since the main objective of the work here is to\nexamine the influence of harmonic analysis method and the\ninclusion of other constituents, these results particularly\nfor M2 are of acceptable accuracy for this to be achieved.\nIn order to compare the effect of the various harmonic\nanalysis approaches upon the accuracy of the tides in a\nrange of regions from deep water to shallow, a number of\nharmonic analysis results from both deep and shallow wa-\nter ports were examined and compared with the \u201dbench-\nmark\u201d solution. Here for illustrative purposes we will con-\ncentrate upon the ports of Lerwick, and Avonmouth which\nwere examined in detail. To determine the accuracy of the\nharmonic analysis method chosen (Table 3) an analysis was\nperformed using a period (window) of 12h 30min starting\nat t = 0h and then moving the 12h 30min window through\ntime in intervals of 4h. By this means it was possible to\ncheck that the results of the initial conditions had been\nremoved, and also to see if a consistent harmonic analy-\nsis was obtained. Subsequently to investigate the effect of\nreducing the number of analysis constituents only a M2,\nM4 and M6 analysis was performed, (method 2, Table 3),\nthen M2 and M4 (method 3, Table 3) and finally only the\nM2 tide was included (method 4, Table 3). The influence\nof using hourly data (Section 3.1.3) compared with 10min\nvalues was examined in a subsequent analyses, as was the\ninfluence of using 30min values.\n3.1.2. Harmonic analysis of 10min sampled data\nTime series of the amplitude of the M2 tide at Avon-\nmouth and Lerwick derived using methods 1 to 4 in Table\n3 are shown in Fig. 2a and b (method 2 gave similar results\nto 1 and is not shown). From these figures it is clear that at\nboth locations the amplitude of the M2 harmonic derived\nusing method 1 has reached a constant value after 7 days.\nThis suggests that a model spin up time of this order is\nsufficient to remove the effects of the initial conditions af-\nter which the results from the analysis are independent of\nthe period chosen. Namely a periodic steady state has been\nachieved.\nAt deep water ports (illustrated here with reference to\nLerwick, Fig. 2b) a comparable level of accuracy to that\n4\nObs Calc l Calc 2\nM2 ho go hc gc hc gc\nSt Marys 176.5 130 172.2 151 169.6 166\nNewlyn 169.7 135 168.9 151 165.4 166\nAvonmouth 424.9 202 430.8 242 406.8 258\nHilbre 292.3 317 288.6 336 282.5 351\nHeysham 315.6 293 304.9 2 292.6 17\nCromer 152.1 188 196.9 202 189.6 216\nSheerness 203.2 354 212.1 2 201.3 17\nDover 223.5 331 247.3 357 236.9 11\nPortsmouth 141.7 326 137.9 354 132.6 8\nPortland 60.7 191 70.9 189 71.3 207\nSt Helier 336.0 182 338.3 201 330.8 217\nM4\nSt Marys 6.6 184 4.2 247 3.6 274\nNewlyn 10.9 169 7.3 216 6.3 246\nAvonmouth 28.5 347 107.0 66 87.7 103\nHilbre 19.8 203 17.3 237 15.4 263\nHeysham 19.7 243 55.5 311 48.8 341\nCromer 7.4 277 11.1 331 9.8 360\nSheerness 11.0 16 17.1 312 14.6 346\nDover 26.6 220 19.2 277 16.8 307\nPortsmouth 19.9 13 12.5 91 10.6 121\nPortland 13.6 25 9.5 112 7.1 141\nSt Helier 19.9 299 19.3 355 15.8 27\nM6\nSt Marys 1.5 350 0.6 84 0.3 135\nNewlyn 0.6 335 0.6 71 0.4 145\nAvonmouth 12.0 272 15.3 278 13.0 332\nHilbre 2.4 32 11.1 77 7.0 120\nHeysham 2.0 10 12.7 326 6.6 8\nCromer 3.0 43 5.8 6 3.9 55\nSheerness 5.4 38 10.7 85 6.1 129\nDover 6.8 104 12.7 135 7.5 184\nPortsmouth 11.5 148 17.2 255 10.2 302\nPortland 6.0 60 10.5 114 6.5 161\nSt Helier 1.2 358 5.1 337 3.5 28\nTable 4\nComparison of observed (ho,go) and computed (hc,gc) amplitude (cm) and phase (degrees) of the M2, M4 and M6 tide at a number of gauges,\nbased on an accurate analysis\nachieved using method 1 was found with method 2, al-\nthough a slight variation in the M2 tidal amplitude was\nfound at the shallow water locations. Although an analysis\nbased upon just the M2 and M4 tides (method 3) gave a\ncomparable level of accuracy (with some small fluctuations)\nto that found with method 1, at deep water locations (e.g.\nLerwick), a significant error was found at shallow water lo-\ncations (e.g. Avonmouth), with changes in amplitude of the\norder of 1cm, depending upon the period chosen. When an\nanalysis based on just the M2 tide was performed (method\n4), there was a significant variation at Avonmouth of the\norder of over 6cm, although at Lerwick the variation was\nnot significant.\n3.1.3. Harmonic analysis of 60min sampled data\nWhen the harmonic analysis was based on hourly val-\nues (methods 5, 6, 7 and 8), the variation increased sig-\nnificantly at the shallow water locations (Fig. 2c). In this\ncase a variation of over 10cm occurred at Avonmouth in an\nM2 only analysis, which reduced to 4cm when M4 was in-\ncluded. Results from an M2, M4, and M6 solution were not\nsignificantly different from those found with an M2 to M10\nanalysis using hourly or ten minute values (Fig. 3a and c).\nAt Lerwick, the difference between anM2 only analysis us-\ning hourly data (method 8), and an accurate analysis was\nless than 0.1cm (Fig. 2d).\n3.1.4. Discussion of the importance of data interval and\nhigher harmonics upon accuracy\nResults using 30min sampled data were slightly better\nthan those with 60min but 10min values were really re-\nquired for an accurate analysis. From these calculations it\nis evident that accuracy is improved by using 10min sam-\nples and analysing for constituents in group A, even when\nonly the M2 constituent is required. The use of group A\nconstituents and 10min values is more important at shal-\nlow water than deep water ports. In order to understand\nthis it is useful to compare the contribution of the higher\nharmonics to the solution at each location.\nResults from the accurate harmonic analysis (method\n1, Table 3) show (Table 5) that at a deep water location\nnamely Lerwick the solution is dominated by the M2 tide,\nwhile at shallow water ports namely Avonmouth higher\nharmonics are appreciable. A consequence of performing an\nharmonic analysis for the M2 tide only is that these higher\nharmonics are not taken into account and hence contribute\nto noise in the record (Godin, 1972), and influence the ac-\ncuracy of the M2 tide. If they are included in the harmonic\nanalysis, even though constituents such as M8 and above\ncannot be resolved and hence may not be physically mean-\ningful, their inclusion in the harmonic analysis does improve\nthe accuracy of the M2 tide. This is particularly important\nwhen only hourly output from the model is saved. In this\n5\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFig. 2.

However, there\nmay be some inaccuracies in the M4 and M6 harmonics.\nTo obtain maximum accuracy (namely a \u201dbest practice\u201d\napproach) it is essential to use 10min data, and a full set\nof harmonics (namely group A, Table 1).\n3.2. Harmonic analysis of synthetic data\nIn the previous section numerical model results were used\nto examine factors influencing the accuracy of the M2 tide\nin both deep and shallow water locations. In order to ex-\namine how these factors influence the accuracy of theM4\nandM6 tide and complement the numerical model results,\n6\n(e) (f)\n(g)\nFig. 2. (Contd.)\nthe analysis of a synthetic time series is considered here.\nBy this means we can be sure that the time variation found\ninitially in the M2 harmonic analysis is not a function of\nthe numerical model.\nTo examine in detail the influence of the harmonic anal-\nysis method (Table 3), upon the accuracy of the M2, M4,\nand M6 tides at shallow water locations, a synthetic time\nseries was generated using the amplitude and phase of the\nM2 to M12 harmonics for Avonmouth as given in Table 5.\nThe time variability of the M2 amplitude based upon an\nanalysis of 10min values for only this constituent is shown\nin Fig. 2e. As in the case with model output the harmonic\nanalysis using only theM2 tide shows appreciable time vari-\nability in its amplitude. This confirms that the variability\nis a function of the harmonic analysis approach and not\ndue to the numerical model. However, the time variability\nin the analysis decreases giving an accurate value of M2\namplitude when a full set (constituent set A) is used, as in\nthe numerical model case.\nAt many shallow water locations, it is physically inter-\nesting to examine the amplitude of both the M4 and M6\ntide which are appreciable in such regions. The amplitude\nof the M4 tide derived from an M2, M4 analysis (Set C,\nTable 2), shows (Fig. 2f) an appreciable error (relative to\nits magnitude). This error diminishes whenM6 is included\n(Set B), with an accurate analysis when the full set is used\n(Fig. 2f). Similarly for M6 there is a significant error (Fig.\n2g) using Set B, although this is reduced using a full set\nof constituents. When hourly data is used the accuracy is\nappreciably reduced.\nAlthough in the case of the M2 tide, performing an anal-\nConstituent Avonmouth Lerwick\nh g h g\nM2 431 224 64 305\nM4 107 42 1 36\nM6 15 248 1 282\nM8 9 141 0 94\nM10 1 338 0 24\nM12 3 282 0 232\nTable 5\nAmplitude h (cm) and phase g (degrees) of the M2 tide and its higher\nharmonics at two locations\nysis in which the higher harmonics are included does not\npresent a problem, as we will show later this does present\nsome difficulties when a number of harmonics are involved.\n3.3. Harmonic analysis of numerical model tides\ngenerated with M2, S2, N2, K1, and O1 tidal forcing\n3.3.1. Tidal distributions and influence of shallow water\nAlthough theM2 tide has the largest magnitude, the S2,\nN2, K1, and O1 tides are significant and cannot be ne-\nglected in any calculation aimed at an accurate determina-\ntion of the M2 tide, as they contribute to the frictional ef-\nfects in shallow water. The non\u2013linear interaction of these\ntidal constituents in shallow regions gives rise to a range of\nshallow water constituents, which as we will show have to\nbe taken into account when performing an harmonic anal-\nysis if an accurate description of the principal constituents,\nnamely the M2, S2, N2, K1, and O1 tides is to be derived.\nIn this calculation the 2D model with the same coeffi-\ncient of bottom friction as used previously and M2, S2, N2,\nK1, and O1 forcing applied along the open boundary was\n7\nintegrated in time for a period of 215 days. This length of\ndata was used so that the variations due to analysis method\n(Table 3) of a range of constituents (Table 1) could be ex-\namined in detail. The M2 cotidal chart (not shown) de-\nrived from the most accurate analysis (see later discussion)\nshowed a similar distribution to that found previously, al-\nthough tidal amplitudes were reduced in some shallow wa-\nter areas (Table 4) due to the presence of increased friction\narising from including the other constituents. This suggests\nthat in shallow regions it is important to include the ef-\nfects of other harmonics if an accurateM2 tide is to be ob-\ntained. The spatial distributions of the S2 and N2 tides\n(not shown) were similar to those found for the M2 tide,\nand other model studies (Davies et al., 1997c; Kwong et al.,\n1997), and a comparison with observations at some A class\ngauges is given in Table 4. The accuracy of the model was\ncomparable to that of Kwong et al. (1997).\nCotidal charts of the higher harmonics M4 and M6\nshowed similar distributions to those presented previously,\nalthough their values had been influenced by the presence\nof the other constituents. The diurnal (K1 and O1) coti-\ndal charts (not presented but comparable to Kwong et al.\n(1997)), show an amphidromic point off the south\u2013west\ncorner of Norway with tidal amplitudes within the North\nSea reaching a maximum in the region of the Wash. At\nthe shelf edge, there are regions of local intensification\ndue to a shelf edge resonance in this area (Huthnance\net al., 1986; Huthnance, 1989; Heaps et al., 1988). In the\npresent model the grid is not sufficiently fine to resolve\nthese features, which have been examined in more detail\nusing localised shelf edge models (Proctor and Davies,\n1995; Xing and Davies, 1996). A comparison of computed\nvalues based on an accurate analysis (method 1, Table 3b)\nwith observations at a limited number of locations is given\nin Table 6. This comparison suggests that the model can\naccurately (given its limited resolution in shallow water\nregions) reproduce the main tidal constituents, and hence\nthe time series from the model can be used to examine the\nsensitivity of tidal constituents to analysis method.\nBefore considering the accuracy of a range of harmonic\nanalysis approaches it is useful to examine the time series\nof elevations at a deep water port (Lerwick) and shallow\nport (Avonmouth) (Fig. 3a and b). The first 50 days from\nthe model are shown for illustrative purposes. The eleva-\ntion time series at Lerwick (Fig. 3a(i)) shows a spring\u2013neap\ncycle modulated by the N2 tide, and a diurnal variation\ndue to the K1 and O1 tide. At any given time the maxi-\nmum high water and minimum low water tidal elevations\nare comparable. Similar time variations (Fig. 3b(i) and (ii))\nare found at Avonmouth. However, at this port the magni-\ntude of low water is significantly less than high water. This\nis due to the shallow water at this location and the nature\nof the bed stress term k\u03c1U |U |\/(h + \u03b6), where k is the bot-\ntom drag coefficient, h mean water depth, \u03c1 density, and\nU instantaneous current magnitude. As free surface eleva-\ntion \u03b6 decreases the bed stress term for a given U increases,\nwith bed stress becoming infinite if \u03b6 = \u2212h. For this reason\na drying condition (see Jones and Davies (1995)) is used in\nthe model which prevents \u03b6 falling below h by effectively\nstopping the flow out of the region when h + \u03b6 is small,\nusually of order 0.1m, and consequently keeping \u03b6 constant\nwith time until the region floods again. In a fine resolution\nmodel (e.g. the 1km grid model of the eastern Irish Sea of\nDavies and Lawrence (1995)) this can lead to a time series\nwith an essentially fixed \u03b6 at low waters and varying \u03b6 only\nat high waters when the near coastal region has flooded. In\nthe present coarse grid model drying has not occurred at\nAvonmouth but high frictional dissipation has reduced the\namplitude of the tide at low water, to give the sinusoidal\ntime series shown in Fig. 3b.\nIn shallow water non\u2013linear interaction between the ma-\njor tidal constituents in particular M2, S2, and N2 can lead\nto both higher harmonics (e.g. M4, MS4, MN4. . . see\nKwong et al. (1997) for detail) and also additional semi\u2013\ndiurnal constituents in particular \u03bc2 due to interaction be-\ntween M2 and S2 (Kwong et al., 1997). Consequently be-\nsides analysing for the tides at the forcing frequencies (M2,\nS2, N2, K1 and O1, Group G, Table 2), these other con-\nstituents (Group F, Table 2) must be considered. (The con-\nsequences of not including them will be examined later.)\nAs we will show, even group F is insufficient for an accurate\nanalysis at Avonmouth.\nIt is evident from Fig. 3a(ii) that at Lerwick, apart from\nan initial period of order a few days (when the model is\n\u201dspinning up\u201d) the residual after removing the tide based\non the Group G analysis was small. When this group was\nexpanded (Group F) to take account of shallow water con-\nstituents which were small at this location, the computed\nresidual (not shown) was negligible. However, at Avon-\nmouth (Fig. 3a(ii)(iii)) even though the residual decreases\ngoing fromGroupG to F, it is evident that the residual time\nseries, determined by subtracting the time series computed\nusing the Group F constituents, clearly shows (Fig. 3b(iii))\nthat there is semi\u2013diurnal energy still in the record. To re-\nduce this and find the distribution of this energy over the\nsemi\u2013diurnal band, additional constituents namely \u03bd2, L2\nand T2 were added giving Group E (Table 2). The addition\nof these constituents slightly reduced the residual. To un-\nderstand the importance of including these constituents at\nsome ports and not others it is necessary to examine their\nmagnitude. The magnitude of these constituents, based on\naccurate analysis of the model data, and that of \u03bc2 for a\nnumber of shallow water and deep water ports is given in\nTable 7.\nAt deep water ports e.g. Lerwick and Stornoway where\nnon\u2013linear interaction is small, and the influence of bottom\nfrictional effects upon higher harmonic generation is neg-\nligible and the amplitudes of \u03bc2, \u03bd2, L2, and T2 are below\n1cm (Table 7). However, at shallow water ports e.g. Avon-\nmouth, Heysham, St Helier, Immingham and Hilbre Island\nthe amplitude of the \u03bc2, \u03bd2, L2, and T2 is significant (Table\n7). Of these constituents \u03bc2, due to the non\u2013linear interac-\ntion of M2 and S2 is clearly the most important. However,\nthe other constituents particularly \u03bd2 and L2 produced by\n8\nObserved 90 or 215 days 30 days\nE,F,G E F G\nM2\nSt Marys 177 130 170 166 171 166 As 90 days As 90 days\nNewlyn 169 135 165 166 167 165\nAvonmouth 425 201 406 258 409 255\nHilbre 292 317 283 351 286 351\nStornoway 139 197 133 227 133 227\nLerwick 58 312 64 339 64 339\nPortland 61 191 71 207 70 205\nSt Helier 336 182 331 217 329 216\nS2\nSt Marys 61 170 61 207 51 208 As 90 days As 90 days\nNewlyn 57 178 59 209 49 227\nAvonmouth 150 261 130 319 248 357\nHilbre 95 0 98 35 75 43\nStornoway 55 230 56 263 57 264\nLerwick 21 346 25 10 25 11\nPortland 32 242 35 263 59 270\nSt Helier 132 231 133 267 165 280\nN2\nSt Marys 34 110 34 134 35 151 33 133 33 132\nNewlyn 32 116 33 134 36 156 31 133 31 132\nAvonmouth 75 187 69 236 170 251 56 242 53 240\nHilbre 56 294 56 318 53 336 55 316 56 316\nStornoway 28 174 30 199 32 199 30 199 31 199\nLerwick 12 291 15 305 16 303 15 305 15 306\nPortland 14 184 15 188 32 176 15 196 14 197\nSt Helier 65 166 66 189 92 192 64 192 63 189\nK1\nSt Marys 5.4 99 6.4 122 6.4 122 6.4 122 6.2 122\nNewlyn 6.2 110 6.4 126 6.3 125 6.3 125 6.3 126\nAvonmouth 7.2 143 8.1 163 8.0 162 8.0 162 7.6 162\nHilbre 11.2 189 12.5 187 12.1 187 12.1 187 12.1 187\nStornoway 13.2 134 14.2 146 14.2 146 14.2 146 14.2 146\nLerwick 7.6 164 11.3 165 11.3 165 11.3 165 11.3 165\nPortland 8.4 111 7.2 130 6.8 130 6.8 130 6.9 130\nSt Helier 9.0 97 9.4 130 9.2 130 9.2 130 9.1 130\nDays (30-45) Days (60-75)\nG F G F\nM2\nSt Marys 166 168 170 168 167 167 171 167\nNewlyn 161 168 166 168 163 167 168 167\nAvonmouth 409 266 427 262 409 263 429 225\nHilbre 275 353 284 353 277 352 286 353\nStornoway 134 228 134 228 134 228 134 228\nLerwick 65 339 65 339 65 339 65 339\nPortland 81 210 80 206 78 209 78 204\nSt Helier 339 220 345 219 337 219 344 218\nS2\nSt Marys 60 208 61 207 60 208 61 208\nNewlyn 57 209 58 208 57 209 59 209\nAvonmouth 126 324 124 319 130 325 131 320\nHilbre 96 35 99 34 96 35 99 35\nStornoway 56 264 56 264 56 263 56 263\nLerwick 25 11 25 11 25 10 25 10\nPortland 35 267 34 264 36 266 34 263\nSt Helier 132 269 132 268 134 269 134 268\nN2\nSt Marys 28 126 30 138 27 132 33 142\nNewlyn 24 123 27 140 24 133 32 145\nAvonmouth 18 355 52 265 47 306 76 255\nHilbre 46 306 47 325 45 313 53 327\nStornoway 31 201 31 200 31 200 31 199\nLerwick 14 310 15 308 15 309 15 307\nPortland 18 234 21 206 21 218 23 189\nSt Helier 47 208 63 207 59 207 76 200\nK1\nSt Marys 6.5 125 6.5 123 6.4 122 6.6 120\nNewlyn 6.5 129 6.5 127 6.3 125 6.5 123\nAvonmouth 8.7 173 8.5 163 7.8 168 8.7 158\nHilbre 12.5 187 12.8 189 12.5 183 12.5 185\nStornoway 14.3 146 14.2 146 14.3 146 14.3 146\nLerwick 11.5 164 11.5 164 11.3 164 11.3 164\nPortland 7.4 132 7.3 132 6.7 125 6.7 123\nSt Helier 9.5 133 9.5 131 8.7 130 9.0 127\nTable 6\nSensitivity of M2, S2, N2 and K1 tidal amplitude (cm) and phase (degrees) to time span and groups of harmonics (E, F, G) used in harmonic\nanalysis method 9\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 3.

In the calculation in which only the M2\ntide was present, the tidal range was much smaller and\nthis asymmetry was less significant. When other tidal con-\nstituents were added the tidal range became comparable\nwith the water depth, and significant fluctuations in bed\nstress arose during the tidal cycle.\nCotidal charts of the shallow water constituent (\u03bc2) and\nadditional constituents \u03bd2 andL2 (Group E, Table 2) exhib-\nited significant spatial variability in their amplitude. The\nT2 cotidal chart (not shown) revealed that its amplitude\nwas the order of 2cm and confined to near coastal regions.\nThe cotidal charts of \u03bc2, \u03bd2 and L2 (not presented) show\nthat they have a significant contribution in the near coastal\nregions where bottom friction and non\u2013linear interaction\ncan be substantial. In the present model, unlike in the cal-\nculations of Kwong et al. (1997), there is no forcing at the\n\u03bd2 or L2 period through the open boundary or from the tide\ngenerating terms, and consequently these constituents are\n10\ngenerated here by local effects and their amplitudes will be\ninfluenced by how bottom frictional effects and drying in\nshallow water regions are parameterised in the model. Ob-\nviously if the drying condition is set such that adjacent grid\nboxes in essence become land earlier or later in the tidal cy-\ncle, this will influence the tidal range and hence minimum\nwater depth at the point under consideration. Significant\nchanges in this minimum water depth through frictional ef-\nfects will determine if constituents such as \u03bd2 or L2 need to\nbe included in the analysis. However, some care is required\nif these constituents are omitted, since as shown previously\nif shallow water constituents are omitted in the harmonic\nanalysis they can influence the accuracy of the major con-\nstituents. The influence of these constituents in particular\n\u03bc2 will be considered in the next section.\n3.3.2. Influence of harmonic analysis method upon\naccuracy\nThe accuracy of the harmonics derived from analysing\ndifferent lengths of data with a range of tidal constituents,\nare given in Table 6, for a representative number of deep\nand shallow water ports, using groups of constituents E,\nF and G (Table 2). In the case of an analysis of a 215\nor 90 day time series all groups of constituents yielded an\nidentical analysis for the M2, S2, N2, and K1 tide. (Similar\nresults were found for O1 and K1 in all the analysis methods\nused, and hence only K1 is presented here.) A comparable\nlevel of accuracy was found with a 60 day analysis for the\nmajor constituents, although the accuracy of the smaller\nconstituents in shallow water was reduced (not presented).\nThe M2 and S2 harmonics derived from a 30 day anal-\nysis with groups G and F were not significantly different\nfrom those derived with a 90 day analysis, although when\ngroup E was used the amplitude of harmonics such as \u03bc2,\n\u03bd2, L2, and T2 became artificially large and an error ap-\npeared in the amplitude of the M2 and S2 tide, particularly\nat shallow water ports such as Avonmouth and St Helier\n(Table 6). The diurnal tide was not appreciably influenced\nby the group of constituents used, and an analysis of 30 days\nyielded an accurate solution. Similarly an accurate M2 and\nS2 solution could be derived from a 30 day analysis with\ngroups G or F. However, for N2 at shallow water ports the\n30 day analysis with groups G or F was less accurate than\nfor M2 and S2. In the case of N2 and M2 the synodic period\n(the time taken for two constituents to come into phase) is\ntwice as long as for M2 and S2, and this together with the\nsmaller amplitude of N2 will influence its accuracy.\nAt deep water ports such as Stornoway or Lerwick the\ngeneration of the \u03bc2 tide, and other constituents namely \u03bd2,\nL2, and T2 is negligible and hence, an accurate N2 analysis\nis possible from a 30 day time series. Similarly at ports\nsuch as St Marys and Newlyn where the model computes\nan appreciable (of order 6cm) amplitude for \u03bc2, the N2\nanalysis has an acceptable accuracy. However, in shallow\nwater regions (e.g. Avonmouth and St Helier) where \u03bc2\nand L2 are appreciable (Table 7), the N2 harmonic has a\nsignificant error.\nIn the case of a 15 day analysis, besides using groups\nG and F, two time periods were chosen, namely 30 days\nand 60 days after the start of the calculation, in order to\nexamine the accuracy and variability in the analysis. For\ndeep water ports such as Stornoway and Lerwick, accurate\n(identical with those from a 90 or 215 day analysis) M2, S2,\nN2, O1, and K1 constituents could be obtained from either\n15 day period using group G or F. For shallow water ports\n(e.g. Avonmouth) there were some errors in the M2 and S2\nharmonics, with a larger error in the smaller semi\u2013diurnal\nnamely N2, although the N2 accuracy could be improved by\nincluding \u03bc2 within the harmonic analysis. This is because\nthe frequency of \u03bc2 is much closer to N2 than M2 and\nS2 (Table 1) and hence energy from \u03bc2 can \u2019leak\u2019 into N2\nand also because N2 is a smaller constituent and hence\nmore affected by noise (i.e. constituents not included in\nthe analysis) than either M2 or S2. Although the diurnal\nconstituents are small, they are well removed in frequency\nfrom both the semi\u2013diurnal tides (e.g. \u03bc2, \u03bd2, L2, T2) and\nhigher harmonics (e.g. M4, MS4, MN4, M6) which are\nsignificant in shallow water and hence an accurate analysis\ncould be obtained at both deep and shallow water ports\n(although a variation of 1cm in amplitude was found at\nAvonmouth) using a 15 day time series.\nObviously the amount of energy which can leak from\n\u03bc2 to other semi\u2013diurnal tidal constituents depends upon\ntheir relative amplitude and the time period considered. To\nexamine this in detail it is valuable to use a synthetic time\nseries containing the M2, S2, N2, and \u03bc2 tides.\n3.4. Harmonic analysis of M2, S2, N2 and \u03bc2 using\nsynthetic data\nTo complement the analysis of model output and further\nexamine the extent to which energy can leak from \u03bc2 to\nother semi\u2013diurnal tides it is valuable to generate a syn-\nthetic time series with constituent\u2019s amplitude and phase\nas shown in Table 8. The amplitudes of M2, S2, and N2 were\ncomparable to those found in the model at Avonmouth,\nalthough the \u03bc2 amplitude was increased slightly to illus-\ntrate what would occur in a very shallow region with an\nenhanced \u03bc2 due to increased non\u2013linear interaction. The\nphase of the constituents is arbitrary.\nTidal amplitude and phase from an analysis of a 15 day\ntime series for the M2, S2, N2, and \u03bc2 harmonic (Analysis\nA, Table 8) were identical with those used to compute the\nsynthetic time series. Although with such a short time span\nthe matrix to be inverted is very badly conditioned, it can\nbe accurately inverted, and since there is no noise (namely\nconstituents that are not included in the analysis) in the\ntime series, an accurate analysis is possible. When the same\ntime series is analysed but only for the M2, S2 and N2\nconstituents, (Analysis B, Table 8) then the contribution of\nthe \u03bc2 tide to the time series is effectively noise. Because of\nthe ill\u2013conditioned nature of the analysis matrix this leads\n11\nConstituent Synthetic Analysis A Analysis B Analysis C\n(frequency) (15 days) (15 days) (15 days)\nh g h g h g h g\nS2 30.0000 133 60 133 60 151 57 134 60\nM2 28.9841 450 50 450 50 503 48 451 50\nN2 28.4397 90 40 90 40 145 78 86 41\n\u03bc2 27.9682 86 30 86 30 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nTable 8\nSensitivity of tidal amplitude h (cm) and phase g (degrees) for a number of tidal constituents at Avonmouth to inclusion\/exclusion of \u03bc2 in\nthe analysis and length of data\nto a 61% error in N2, 12% in M2 and 14% in S2. However,\nwhen the analysis period is extended to 30 days (Analysis\nC, Table 8) thematrix is better conditioned and only theN2\ntide is significantly in error. This error is larger than would\noccur in the model, since the amplitude of \u03bc2 relative to N2\nhas been slightly increased in this example. The analysis of\nthe synthetic data time series confirms themain conclusions\nfrom the model time series. It clearly shows that the \u03bc2 tide\nshould be included in the analysis in order to maximise the\naccuracy of the computed M2 and S2 constituents.\n4. Discussion and conclusions\n4.1. Model forced with M2 only\nA two dimensional model of the European Continental\nshelf has been used to examine the accuracy of computed\ntidal elevations to harmonic analysis method. Initial calcu-\nlations were performed with only an M2 tidal forcing, and\noutput was saved at coastal locations at 10min intervals. In\nshallow water regions higher harmonics of the M2 tide were\ngenerated, and calculations showed that it was essential to\ninclude these in the harmonic analysis, if an accurate M2\ntide was to be obtained. At deeper water ports where the\nhigher harmonics are less important, then an accurate so-\nlution could be obtained from an M2 only analysis. If the\nanalysis was based on 30min or hourly values then it was\nparticularly important to include the higher harmonics at\nthe shallow water locations. In the case of a shallow water\nport where the M4 tide is important, since its amplitude is\nsignificantly less than that of M2, then it is essential to in-\nclude all the higher harmonics in the time series analysis,\nif an accurate M4 is to be derived.\n4.2. Model forced with multiple constituents\nSubsequent calculations showed that the presence of\nother tidal constituents in particular S2, N2, K1 and O1\ncould influence the amplitude of the M2 tide by increasing\nbottom friction. These other constituents produced an in-\ncrease in tidal range, which could lead to significant time\nvariations in bed stresses in shallow regions with an asso-\nciated asymmetry producing energy at the \u03bd2, L2 and T2\nperiods. Also, non\u2013linear interaction between the M2 and\nS2 tides, give rise to the \u03bc2 tide. The analysis of a 90 day\ntime series was identical to that from a 215 day period and\nwas used as the \u201dbenchmark\u201d in determining the accuracy\nof results from shorter period analysis.\nHarmonic analysis at shallow water ports where \u03bc2 was\nappreciable showed that it was particularly important to\ninclude this constituent in order to avoid appreciable errors\nin the M2, S2 and N2 constituents if a short (of order 15\ndays) model run was analysed.\n4.3. Conclusions and \u201dbest practice\u201d\nIn essence results from the detailed analysis of a range\nof methods used to harmonically analyse data from numer-\nical models showed that 10min sampling was preferential\nto using 30min or hourly output. In a numerical model\nunlike in field measurements the only source of noise is\nthat due to tidal constituents which are omitted from the\nharmonic analysis. Consequently provided all forcing con-\nstituents and those arising through non\u2013linear interaction\nin shallowwater are included, and an accuratematrix solver\nis used, then an accurate solution from a short span of data\nis possible. In very shallow regions where the tidal range is\ncomparable to the water depth, it is essential to include a\nlarge number of constituents.\nAs the geographical extent of models increases and grids\nbecome finer, computational requirements rapidly increase\nparticularly in three dimensional models. Consequently any\nmeans of achieving an accurate harmonic analysis from a\nshort model run becomes more important.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are indebted to Mrs. L.
