This paper begins \nto fill this space by drawing on the narratives of a sub-set of twenty-five respondents \nfrom two studies funded by the UK Leadership Foundation for Higher Education \n(Whitchurch 2008; 2009), who had roles with significant academic elements such as \nteaching and tutoring, programme design, or some form of applied research. The \nmajority had doctorates, previous experience of teaching and\/or research in adult, \nfurther or higher education, and publication records, usually in relation to practice-\nbased research. It was clear that a number of them could have gone either way, into a \nmainstream academic, or into a more project-oriented type of role, and some had \nmoved in and out of academic roles. Although not generally categorised as \n\u201eacademic\u201f for employment purposes, some had split \u201eacademic\u201f and \u201enon-academic\u201f \ncontracts.  \n \nThe respondents were drawn from institutions in the UK, Australia and the United \nStates, as follows: \n 2 \n\uf0b7 Five UK institutions: three pre-1992, and two post-1992 universities. \n\uf0b7 Two Australian institutions: one research-intensive, sandstone university; and \none teaching-oriented, post-merger institution, created from a number of \ncolleges of technical and further education.  \n\uf0b7 Two public institutions in the United States: one a state university with a \nbalanced teaching and research profile; and the other a world-class, research-\nintensive university. \nThe choice of institutions did not seek to reflect the diversity of each national system, \nbut took account of contextual variables such as institutional structure and mission, as \nwell as regional and national agendas. It was also possible to make comparisons \nbetween the US system, which is strongly market-oriented but also takes seriously its \npublic service role, and the UK and Australian systems, which are becoming more \nmarket-oriented against a background of increasing resource constraints. Public \nfunding in the latter countries is also strongly influenced by the outcomes of teaching \nand research assessment exercises, and a contribution to the national economy \nexpressed in terms of, for instance, employability and skills agendas. In all three \ncountries, respondents were employed by their institutions rather than by local or \nnational government, as is the case in some European countries. In the US, links with \nregulatory and funding bodies were likely to be at the level of state legislatures. \n \nGatekeepers in each institution were asked to nominate respondents who had mixed \nacademic and professional elements in their roles, including, for instance, academic \nstaff who were heading up a spin out or partnership unit; or professional staff who \nundertook roles such as teaching support in study skills or outreach, or research into \nissues such as student choice or retention rates. The backgrounds of respondents \nincluded: \n\uf0b7 Adult, further or higher education \n\uf0b7 Lifelong learning\/continuing education \n\uf0b7 School teaching and teacher education \n\uf0b7 English as a second language \n\uf0b7 Academic literacy\/study skills  \n\uf0b7 Policy research into eg regional and overseas development \n\uf0b7 Scientific research and practice. \n \nThey were involved in five main fields of activity having academic components, as \nfollows:  \n \n[position Table 1 here] \n \nRespondents were also likely to combine disciplinary interests with project portfolios \nand\/or research into policy and practice. As illustrated in Figure 1, activity related to \nproject portfolios could co-exist with, be informed by, and feed into mainstream \nacademic and institutional activity, as well as creating feedback loops with wider \nnetworks: \n \n[position Figure 1 here] \n \nInvolvement in projects with academic components would be likely to suit what \nDowd and Kaplan (2005) refer to as \"boundaryless\" academic staff who take a \n 3 \nfreewheeling approach to career development. Some people would be likely to move \nin and out of project space, seeing it as a place in which intellectual or career \nrefreshment might occur, perhaps aligned with study leave. There was also some \nevidence from the studies that people in this space may be either at the beginning or \nthe end of their careers, the former using it as exploratory space or a stepping stone to \nan academic or other type of career; the latter pursuing a specific interest that they \nhad not been in a position to pursue earlier. The data is therefore contextualised \nagainst a background of more dynamic academic communities, and of contemporary \nparadigms of identity as being spatial, fluid and contingent (Barnett and di Napoli \n2008; Delanty 2008; Taylor 2008), rather than fixed around disciplinary territories.  \n \nShifting patterns of academic activity are also reflected in employment data. \nAccording to the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) (2010), only 52% \nof academic staff, who in turn comprise 47% of the total higher education workforce \nin the UK, continue to undertake both teaching and research, traditionally seen as \nessential elements of being an academic. Furthermore, 17 % of academic staff are \ndescribed as grades \u201eother than\u201f than professor, senior lecturer, lecturer etc, \nillustrating the difficulty of characterising emergent staff categories. Identities are \nforming in spaces that incorporate, for instance, professional, practitioner, and \norganisational, as well as disciplinary interests, and in extended locations such as \nexternal agencies and partners, outreach and offshore sites. Academically oriented \nproject spaces may also be virtual or web-based, and residency multiple, overlapping, \npermanent or provisional.  \n \nAlthough the studies on which this paper draws were conducted in the UK, US and \nAustralia, there is evidence that these contexts are also being experienced in Europe \n(Krucken, Blumen and Kloke 2009; Kehm, Merkator and Schneijderberg 2010; \nNickel and Ziegele 2010; Zellweger Moser and Bachman 2010). It should also be \nnoted, for the purposes of this paper, that the term \u201eadministration\u201f, when used by \nrespondents to refer to \u201enon-academic\u201f work, has different meanings in US and \nUK\/Australian contexts. In the UK and Australia, although originally derived from a \ncivil service context, it now also tends to imply more routine or process oriented \ntasks. By contrast, in the United States, the term \u201eadministration\u201f is associated with \ninstitutional policy and governance, and the most senior institutional managers, \nincluding presidents, are referred to as \u201eadministrators\u201f. In this paper, the terms \n\u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201cprofessional\u201d are also used to describe activity that does not have \nacademic components. \n \nModifying binary perceptions \n \nAcademic activity has traditionally been defined in relation to the broad categories of \nteaching, research, and in some higher education systems, third leg or service activity. \nThe concepts of \u201cMode 1\u201d and \u201cMode 2\u201d (Gibbons, Limoges et al 1994) add a further \ndimension of practice-based research. Activity that does not fall precisely into these \ncategories has tended to be described as \u201enon-academic\u201f, and this is reflected in \nemployment statistics.  Central to the academic\/non-academic binary is a perceived split \nbetween collegial approaches, implying academic autonomy and freedom, underpinned \nby the contribution of higher education to the advancement of knowledge; and \nfunctional activity that is geared to institutional and socio-economic goals. This binary \nis reflected in an extensive literature (for instance Marginson and Considine 2000; \n 4 \nWalker and Nixon 2004; Deem 1998, 2005; Fulton 2005); in the concept of the \ninstitutional \u201ccentre\u201d and academic \u201cperiphery\u201d (Clark 1998); and of \u201cmanaged\u201d and \n\u201cmanagerial\u201d professionals (Rhoades 1996; 1998). \n \nMore recently, there has been some recognition of \u201ca new combined academic \nprofession, which moves between expert roles, core activity and support services\u201d \n(Aarrevaara and Holtta 2007: 208).  External changes such as increased emphasis on \nMode 2 and collaborative research, as well as more clearly defined institutional \nagendas, have led to a situation whereby \u201cAcademics have less well-defined and \nprotected \u201espaces of action\u201f in which to determine and pursue their own academic \nagendas\u201d, \u201cindividuals are open earlier to extra-academic professional influences and \nidentity possibilities\u2026\u201d and \u201cacademics, researchers and teachers are working in an \nenvironment of complex, differentiated social groups and influences, where structures \nand relationships are more fluid\u201d (Henkel 2009: 84; 86; 88). Thus, Enders and de Weert \ndescribe an increasingly \u201cT-shaped profession\u201d, involving both \u201cdepth of disciplinary \nknowledge and broader transdisciplinary knowledge and skills\u201d in which \u201cT-shaped \npeople are equipped with competences and skills which are relevant for employment \noutside academia, but also for an increasing diversification of job tasks within the \nacademic profession\u201d (Enders and de Weert 2009: 262). Moreover, this is not \nnecessarily happening by default, and \u201cA mix of these components may be an attractive \noption for staff to have more flexibility in moving across different roles\u201d (Enders and de \nWeert 2009: 265). Likewise, Clegg refers to universities as becoming \u201cmore complex \nand differentiated spaces\u2026 [in which] identities\u2026 are expanding and proliferating\u201d \n(Clegg 2008: 330 and 343). Often such identities are derived from practice-based \ndisciplines, which involve linkages \u201cbeyond the confines of the university\u201d (Clegg \n2008: 341), as well as increasing numbers of staff having fractional and short-term \ncontracts, and associates from the public and private sectors who assist with teaching \nand research (Gordon and Whitchurch 2010).  \n \nFurthermore, there is a cadre of academically oriented staff with doctorates who may \nnot have academic contracts, but who have acquired generic skills from formal research \ntraining programmes. As transferable skills become an integral component of both \ntaught and research-based doctorates, in the UK and elsewhere (see for instance \nResearch Councils UK 2001), it is likely that those possessing such skills will seek roles \nthat are seen as stimulating as, but different from, mainstream academic roles. It is also \nsignificant in this connection that job advertisements for research managers in the UK \nbegan to specify doctorates from 2004 onwards (Shelley 2010: 49; see also Allen \nCollinson (2007, 2009) and Knight and Lightowler (2010) for a discussion of the \ndeveloping roles and identities of research managers with both academic and functional \nresponsibilities). There are also people who begin their careers in functional, as opposed \nto academic, roles, but who see acquiring a doctorate as a way of both gaining status \nand being able to extend their work: \n\u201c \u201eSchool Managers with a PhD operate more autonomously and exert a more \ndirect influence on outcomes where academic issues touch on business\/financial \nmatters\u201f\u201d (Berman and Pitman, 2010: 165). \n \nThese movements are borne out by the narratives of individuals with academic \ncredentials and backgrounds who were employed in academically oriented, but non-\nmainstream academic activity. There was a sense from these narratives that a significant \nproportion of respondents could have gone either way, either into a mainstream \n 5 \nacademic, or into a more project oriented type of role. Moreover, some of the roles that \nthey fulfilled, even if not categorised as academic in employment terms, specified \nacademic skill sets. For instance, the job description of an institutional researcher in the \nUS required: \n\u201cKnowledge of social science research design methods, including qualitative \nand quantitative research methods and descriptive and inferential statistics\u201d. \nOther job descriptions specified both academic and project oriented experience, for \ninstance that of a learning partnership manager in the UK which required \u201can \nexperienced academic manager\u201d, not only with \u201cthe academic credibility to ensure that \ninnovative and complex operations are delivered with high standards and quality\u201d, but \nalso with \u201cexperience of generating external income and involvement in project \nmanagement\u201d.  \n \nAs has been the case for some time in, for instance, the applied sciences and \nprofessional disciplines, the studies provided further evidence that academic career \npathways are becoming less linear, with the possibility of moving between higher \neducation and other sectors. Thus: \n\u201cIndividual choices might now be guided not so much by a clear hierarchy of \nesteem, established by dominant epistemic communities and centred upon \nachievements in scholarship and research, but by an evolving individual sense of \nvalue and aspirational priorities, as the process of self-definition and assessment \nof the availability of options takes place in a more fluid and less exclusive \nenvironment\u201d (Henkel 2009: 91). \nThis was borne out by one respondent who noted a changing approach to careers by \nyounger academics, especially those in practice fields: \n\u201c\u2026professional faculty people do move in and out a lot. The younger ones are \nmuch more likely to go out and work for [a Research Council] for a couple of \nyears, then come back, perhaps do some teaching in a school, come back, do \nsome more academic work, go off and work for a government department, work \non a project\u2026 there are fewer continuing positions\u2026 That also changes \nattitudes because they\u201fve got a broader view of the world as well and a context \nin which to put their university employment\u201d (staff developer, Australia). \n \nPreferences, models and variables  \n \nPreferences \n \nWhen asked how they had found themselves outwith a mainstream academic role, \nrespondents reported a range of reasons. Often it was a combination of circumstances \ninvolving career stages and lifestyles, for instance they had found their subject \ndiscipline too limiting or no longer interesting; they were no longer research active; \nthey had discovered an aptitude for other types of activity, perhaps opportunistically; \nthey preferred applied, Mode 2 forms of research; a project oriented role had offered a \nway into higher education, and\/or offered more opportunities in relation to career \ndevelopment or funding; they had aspirations to go into higher education consultancy; \nthey had an ideological commitment to a project such as widening participation; or it \nwas a pragmatic decision such as needing to find a job in the same geographical area as \na partner. Such preferences reflect findings elsewhere that some academic staff identify \nless with their discipline than with wider considerations \u201c\u2026 shaped by the flux of \n 6 \nevents, discoveries, societal evolution, ethical positionings and so on\u2026 as the relation \nto the wider world is re-appraised\u201d (Fanghanel 2012: 80-81). \n \nAt the more pragmatic end of the spectrum, one respondent had made a conscious \ndecision to work in an academic environment, in the hope that it would lead to \nacademic work, if not an academic appointment: \n\u201cI decided I wanted a job at ***. I wanted to be an academic, but going into \nacademic administration had always been my fallback, because I knew \nuniversities and I didn\u201ft think I would be happy in the corporate world at all and \nI wanted to be in an academic environment. So I just started literally applying \nfor any position on the campus that looked reasonable\u2026 I got the job [in \ninstitutional research] because I had the research skills they were looking for\u201d \n(institutional researcher, US). \nAnother person with a strong academic record and career history had likewise focused \non the institution, taking the view that: \n\u201cIt\u201fs much better to be in a marginal position in a great university than it is to be \nin a full professor position in a marginal university\u201d (community outreach \nmanager, US). \n \nFor others, conscious that they could have gone either way, it was a question of the \ncareer stage they were at:  \n\u201cIf I were ten years younger, and had just done my doctorate, I would probably \nbe looking at an academic career\u2026 Once people knew [I had a doctorate and \npublished papers] a number of academics emailed me and started engaging with \nme\u2026 it has quite shifted my relationship with academics. I don\u201ft think it has \nchanged their view of my role, but it has created a connection for us which \ncertainly wasn\u201ft there before\u2026\u201d (student support manager, Australia). \nDespite elements of pragmatism, however, the majority of respondents represented \ntheir positioning as a positive choice, as in the case of someone who had moved from \nan academic appointment to a policy-oriented one, so as to move to a role where they \ncould apply their disciplinary knowledge as a statistician:  \n\u201cI just got more enjoyment out of administrative work than I did out of \nteaching\u2026 doing theoretical research was not as exciting to me as doing \napplied research and seeing the direct benefits. That\u201fs one of the main reasons \nwhy [I shifted] \u2013 I wanted to see the direct benefit of what I\u201fm doing\u201d \n(institutional researcher, US). \n \nModels  \n \nThe data was analysed by developing descriptive codes for factual details arising \nfrom respondents\u201f accounts, interpretive codes for possible latent meanings, and \npattern codes for links or themes across the accounts (Miles and Huberman, 1994: \n57).  From the descriptive codes, a preliminary categorisation was constructed, \ndescribing each respondent\u201fs activity in terms of their relationship with institutional \nstructures. Although this was not clear-cut in all cases, individuals were categorised \naccording to the dominant features of this relationship. The analysis was an iterative \nprocess between the three sets of codes, and as this took place it became apparent that \nsome institutions were more receptive to academically oriented project work than \nothers, so that in some instances this had developed greater critical mass. In turn, \nsome respondents were more embedded than others within formal structures. As a \n 7 \nresult of the process of analysis, three models of academically oriented project work \nemerged:  \n \nThe integrated model \n \nIn the integrated model, academically oriented project roles were explicitly \nrecognised and embedded in institutional structures, for instance in offices of \ninstitutional and policy research in the US. They typically involved people with a \npolitical science or sociological background, such as the following respondent: \n\u201cI was never 100% that I was going to stay along the faculty route\u2026 this is \nvery much to me like a research-based academic job and what I have to do is a \nlot of data analysis, a lot of policy analysis\u2026 so I kind of see it as an open-\nended funded research project on college access, choice and equity\u2026 [I see \nmy identity] as a professional policy maker\u2026 even though I do have \nmanagement responsibility for two people\u2026 [but] I can also see myself \nmoving back to faculty. I want to keep writing and publishing\u2026 ours is an \napplied field which means that you can take a policy administration or \nindustry job and still come back to faculty\u2026 because there are still things \nabout faculty life I find I am missing\u2026 [such as] guiding dissertations, \nworking with doctoral students, programme development\u201d (institutional \nresearcher, US). \n \nThe knowledge created by such an individual can be seen as applied, Mode 2 \nknowledge by the institution, of the institution. Another respondent referred to \nthemselves as a \u201cknowledge broker\u201d, offering technical expertise, analytical and \ninterpretive capability, and making links between the different \u201edisciplinary\u201f aspects \nof this: \n\u201cThis job [institutional research] requires the mind of an anthropologist \nbecause, you know, in the job that I do, like a social scientist, you\u201fre probing \nfor answers. And you\u201fre looking for patterns and you\u201fre studying people\u2026 \nyou\u201fre looking at people\u201fs lives\u2026 looking at their performance in school, \nlooking at the drop-out rates, you\u201fre following them around for four years, \nseeing what kind of classes they take\u2026 I feel like I\u201fm an archaeologist \ndigging around for information\u201d (institutional researcher, US). \nFurthermore, in the US there exists: \n\u201ca professional cadre of people who could have been faculty members, have \nthe credentials, the training, and whose research is at that level, is a relatively \nlong standing tradition\u2026 of an American university\u2026. they can go as far as \nthe work takes them\u2026 and go toe-to toe-with faculty\u201d (educational outreach \nmanager, US).  \n \nA critical mass of these types of roles across US institutions reinforces institutional \nand policy research as a specialist area of interest within the disciplinary field of \nhigher education. Such disciplinary space is likely to be reinforced within individual \ninstitutions by the presence of interns from master\u201fs programmes wishing to learn \nabout fields as diverse as policy analysis, recruitment patterns or equity issues. \nStudents also become involved as subjects in research studies and as peer tutors to \nundergraduates, thereby making a direct contribution to teaching and research. Thus, \nan institutional researcher in the US described research into the student experience as \n\u201ca joint academic and institutional project\u201d.  \n 8 \n \nThere was also evidence in the US of the development and expansion of new forms of \nacademically oriented space, for instance at the interface between the institution and \nits partner agencies in government and the community. The following respondent \ntherefore saw a range of possibilities open to them: \n\u201cI think my love would be to\u2026 go back into academia\u2026 it wouldn\u201ft be very \nhard for me to make that transition\u2026 I\u201fm teaching about higher ed and higher \ned structures because I do it all the time on the job [for instance to interns and \nexternal delegations]\u2026 [Failing that] I would like progressively more \nresponsible positions within the university, though probably still somewhere \nin this administrative interface between the university and the external world\u201d \n(institutional researcher, US). \n \nIt was apparent that the integrated model appeared to provide the most stable \nenvironment for academically oriented project work. However, this was not universal, \nand depended to a significant degree on the approach of senior managers and \nexecutives. There were examples of individuals in integrated units who felt dis-\nempowered because they had not been kept in an information loop, or given feedback \nabout the outcome of a decision to which they had contributed data and policy \nanalysis, or because they felt that their contribution had been ignored. Others felt \nconstrained by institutional bureaucracy or by being micro-managed by their line \nmanagers. In this type of arrangement, support and recognition from the senior \nmanagement team, or a senior figure, was critical.  \n \nThe semi-autonomous model \n \nIn all three countries there were examples of people who worked on academically  \noriented projects that were located in semi-autonomous units, which were fully or \npartly self-funding, such as spin out, enterprise or learning partnerships: \n\u201c\u2026 we\u201fre a hybrid; so business and professional development short courses\u2026 \ntraditional continuing professional development sit within the section as well. \nIt has to generate income. The collaborative partners bring in income, but \nlearning and teaching is much more of a service provider in some ways, \nalthough it has got a number of funded projects\u201d (learning partnerships \nmanager, UK). \n Such locations appeared to be the most rewarding for the individuals concerned, in \nthat they had a degree of autonomy and were likely to have direct responsibility for \nthe viability, financial or otherwise, of their projects. Although this responsibility \ncould lead to significant challenges and tensions, their positioning seemed to offer \nindividuals the sense of a direct stake in their project, and greater opportunity to fulfil \nthe potential of their roles. They were likely to experience a full range of \nresponsibilities, in which they could be thrown back on their own resources, the highs \nand lows of which were exemplified by a learning support manager in the US:  \n \nLearning support manager, US \nThis individual was studying for a doctorate and worked in a unit promoting access \nto the university for non-traditional and disadvantaged students, in which \u201cyou can \nget tutoring, you can get counselling, you can do career planning...\u201d They saw \nthemselves as having academic, professional and management interests. In an earlier \nrole they had had teaching responsibilities, and had moved into their current position \n 9 \nby chance: \u201cI enjoyed connecting one to one with students, and found that I was \neffective at it, and I didn\u201ft even know it was really a career, so I [became] an \nacademic adviser helping students to select courses and understand academic \npolicies\u201d. Nevertheless, \u201cstaying current\u201d in the field was of paramount importance: \n\u201cNetworking is invaluable, and when I go to conferences I feel energised, I feel \nrecharged\u2026 I\u201fll present a paper here and there...\u201d However, there were stresses in \ncovering all bases: \u201cI feel like I have a good deal of autonomy in my work. It\u201fs pretty \nmuch up to me how I do things\u2026 but I\u201fm managing a service in a lot of ways, so I \nthink depending on what role I\u201fm in I feel more like one or the other\u2026 I often feel the \ntug between, you know, the responsibility to the students and to the campus, and then \nthe responsibility of kind of, you know, paying the bills, because we\u201fre a self-\nsupporting unit\u2026 I have to make decisions because I need to balance the budget.\u201d \nThere were also budgetary constraints, for instance, in employing a researcher to \ndevelop understandings about the learning modes of less advantaged students, as well \nas an awareness that \u201cwe can put ourselves out of business very easily\u201d. A key \nchallenge, therefore, was in relating the more academic aspects of the role to the day-\nto-day realities of management responsibilities: \u201cwe talk about things in an ideal \nworld in the classroom in theory. But then when you actually come to work and try to \ndo it, it doesn\u201ft always happen\u2026 being such a human, service-oriented type of \nprogramme, having that financial responsibility is tough.\u201d Nevertheless: \u201cit\u201fs a great \nplace to be, I love it, I want to spend more time in it, and have ideas about I should do \nthis research or publish that paper\u2026 I hope that in future I will be able to do more \nresearch and publishing\u2026\u201d \n \nAlthough such positioning in a semi-autonomous unit was less protected, involved \nmore risk, and could mean direct involvement in \u201chighly charged political \nenvironment\u201d (partnership manager, US), it provided the stimulus that some \nindividuals were looking for outside the mainstream: \n\u201cI actually enjoy the politics, it\u201fs part of what makes life interesting\u2026 the \npower struggles and the battles that go on and the fighting over the contested \nareas, I find that quite stimulating\u2026\u201d (learning partnerships manager, UK). \nSuch individuals were also likely to represent their institutions in developing key \nrelationships with external partners and in building external networks, which was a \nmotivating factor for some: \n \u201c\u2026 we\u201fre evangelists for learning [and] I think that\u201fs wonderful\u2026 if we can \nwiden the range of the organisations we can help, which is why I came to \nwork [here], to try and put something back\u201d (learning technology manager, \nUK). \n \nThe independent model \n \nThere were also examples of individuals who worked more independently, often by \nchoice, within traditional institutional structures in which there was no critical mass of \nspace related to their specific project. Thus one individual, although having an \nacademic background and working on institutional policy, occupied what was \ncategorised in institutional terms as an administrative or service role. They were \ntherefore obliged to work around their formal positioning, adopting appropriate forms \nof language so to counter perceptions that were undertaking either a service or a \nmanagement function:  \n \n 10 \nPolicy and planning manager (UK) \nThis person, who had a doctorate, had been an academic manager in the college \nsector where they had co-ordinated a degree programme: \u201cleading the expansion of \nthe degree programme across the whole college\u2026 moving away from [my subject \ndiscipline]\u2026 I gained a lot of experience of academic management\u2026 I\u201fd been doing \nlots of curriculum framework projects\u2026 I had a small project grant, that kind of \nthing\u201d. On moving to a higher education institution they found that: \u201cI ended up in \nuniversity administration, with no concept of what it was, no particular career \naspiration to be a university administrator, and when I got here I realised\u2026 some of \nthe boundaries placed around \u201eadministration\u201f. That\u201fs certainly not the way I\u201fd ever \noperated, or expected to operate\u2026 and something you have to work through\u201d.  On a \nday-to-day basis, they saw themselves as  \u201cas working in partnership\u201d with academic \ncolleagues, notwithstanding their positioning in \u201ethe administration\u201f, \u201cespecially \nonce\u2026 academics begin to appreciate the sort of things that my involvement can \nbring\u201d. Their academic background enabled them to work with departments in \ndeveloping academic initiatives and applying for research funding: \u201cThis paper I\u201fm \nwriting at the moment\u2026 I\u201fm leading the bid\u2026 because I\u201fve got the experience and\u2026 \nthe understanding of the institutional context that\u201fs needed to put something like that \ntogether\u201d. By building both academic and institutional knowledge, therefore, they \nwere in a position to add value to the initiative, but were conscious of working within \ngiven structures and of suppressing both their \u201eacademic\u201f and \u201enon-academic\u201f \nidentities in order to achieve outcomes. At times it was necessary to engage in a type \nof \u201edoublespeak\u201f, therefore, in order to develop and maintain key relationships with \nboth academic colleagues and senior managers: \u201cIt's about adapting the way we \nactually work to fit in with the organisational culture\u2026 If I were working in a \ndifferent organisation, I would see myself as a manager. I don\u201ft think that that\u201fs a \nparticularly valid concept here\u2026 You can't make anybody do anything unless they \nthink it\u201fs a good idea. There is a lot of hostility to the word management, of \nmanagement of academic matters by people who are not actually academics, or if \nthey are academics, not academically involved in that particular area\u2026 so I think it's \nsafer to call it administration.\u201d  This person, therefore, created, and to an extent \nnegotiated, their own space on the basis of the unique contribution that they were \nable to make outwith formal organisational categories. \n \nBy contrast, the academic component of another UK respondent\u201fs role was \naccommodated more visibly in a 50:50 academic\/non-academic contract, which \nacknowledged their contribution to the development of teaching and learning \nprogrammes for widening participation students: \n\u201cI don\u201ft really see myself as an academic in the sense that I\u201fm not like a normal \nacademic in higher education\u2026 because I come in from a completely different \nroute\u2026 but even though I love being partly academic, I also enjoy being part of \na management team, knowing\u2026 I can influence [things]\u2026 at the grass roots \nlevel\u201d (widening participation manager, UK) \nThis person felt that formal recognition of their dual contribution in a split appointment \nwas vital to making a success of their institution\u201fs widening participation mission, to \nwhich they were strongly committed, with an ambition to progress in the field at a \nnational level.  \n \nOther individuals who worked relatively independently occupied what might be \ndescribed as \u201eacademic consultant\u201f roles:  \n 11 \n \nThe \u2018academic consultant\u2019 (Australia) \nThis person had a background in the commercial world and ran their own business at \nthe same time as working in the university. They were employed for their contribution to \nspecific projects, and at any one time were likely to have multiple, fractional contracts. \nAs well as project management roles they also taught on degree programmes. They had \na full range of teaching responsibilities including lecturing, tutoring, marking, and \ndeveloping programme materials and online provision. Organisationally they worked \nbetween an academic department, an educational technology unit and a skills unit. They \ndescribed themselves as having acquired an \u201cacademic headset\u201d which enabled them \nto move between environments: \u201cI find that I can get through to academic staff a lot \neasier and a lot quicker because they accept me as one of them. I don\u201ft have [academic-\nadministrator] tensions because I\u201fve taught on the courses\u2026 if I was living in a school \nor a division there\u201fd be all this ongoing [political] stuff. I\u201fm actually committed to the \nproject and to getting the work done for the university, and that\u201fs where my heart is\u201d. \nHowever, in order to become an academic they had to \u201cgo casual\u201d, which meant that \n\u201cyou teach more remotely, and you just have contact\u2026 with your programme and \nparticularly with the academic that\u201fs employing you\u201d. Their teaching contracts had \narisen through individual contacts and networks: \u201cI\u201fm a good networker, so I know the \npeople in lots of areas across the university, which is good because it means I can get \nwork, but it also means that the word spreads that I do the job well through this \nnetwork\u201d. The downside of being \u201ccasual\u201d was that they were not necessarily \u201eplugged \nin\u201f to all communication channels such as all-staff emails. As a result: \u201cI\u201fve never been \non a career path as such, and I don\u201ft consider myself on a career path [either academic \nor professional]\u201d. They saw themselves rather as \u201cmoving along a path, achieving \nwork for the university that benefits academics and students\u2026 and showing both \nacademics and administrators that they can think kindly of each other and work \ntogether\u201d. They did not therefore fit into any employment category, and their ideal \nwould have been to have an ongoing role with \u201cmodules in your job description that \nyou could fill with [different] activities\u201d. They regretted the fact that \u201cthere are no \npositions that allow you to teach and project manage in one role\u2026 In the business \nworld there is a great deal more freedom in creating positions that suit the needs of the \norganisation.  We don\u201ft have that in the university sector and I think that\u201fs a real \nshame\u201d. This person was involved in bespoke arrangements and relationships, and \ncreated links between the different aspects of their work, for instance by using their \nproject work as case material in teaching.  Although they were not working within the \nparameters of a precise job description or clear organisational structures, their \ncontribution was nevertheless geared to achieving optimal academic outcomes. \n \nIt may be that such split and fractional types of appointment will become more \nwidespread in future in response to the lifestyle preferences of individuals, as well as \nin response to diversifying institution missions and resource pressures. \n \nThe spread of respondents across each model of academically oriented project \nactivity is shown in Table 2: \n \n[insert Table 2 here] \nIn theoretical terms, the relationship between respondents and their institutions can be \nseen through the lens of structure and agency as articulated by, for instance, Giddens \n(1991) and Archer (2000). Individuals working within the integrated model might be \n 12 \nseen as both \u201canimating\u201d (acting out) and \u201cpersonifying\u201d (investing in) (Archer 2000) \nthe role of translator between different internal constituencies, and between the \ninstitution and external agencies. Thus, their roles are defined to a significant extent \nby existing structures, which can be both enabling (for instance by allowing \ndiscretion in the presentation of academic initiatives in ways that are appropriate to \nspecific external funders) and constraining (for instance by exclusion from strategic \ndecision and policy making). Those in the semi-autonomous model are more likely to \nbe able to exercise agency in developing their project, and also in influencing existing \ninstitutional structures and processes, especially if they are able to use the leverage \nthat comes from a successful project. Those represented by the independent model \nexercise agency in working around existing structures, rather than their activity being \ndetermined by, for instance, the formal parameters of a job description. They are also \nlikely to operate under the assumption that they are not in a position to influence or \nchange such structures. \n \nWith a caveat about conclusions that can be drawn from a sample of twenty-five \nrespondents in nine institutions, the integrated model was more evident in the US, \nwhere academically oriented activity was of longer standing, with the establishment \nof offices dedicated to specific project areas, notably institutional research. The semi-\nautonomous model appeared to be more evident in the UK, which might be accounted \nfor by an expansion of self-funding units alongside an increased market orientation in \nthe UK system. In Australia the spread of individuals across the three models was \nmore evenly balanced. The semi-autonomous and independent models appeared to \ngenerate more criticality of existing structures, although those individuals working \nwithin the semi-autonomous model had a greater sense of being able to influence both \nspecific projects and mainstream agendas. In the independent model, energy was \nlikely to be expended on working round formal structures, which could reduce the \ntime available to progress individual projects. In the integrated model, projects were \nmore likely to be prescribed by institutional policy, and respondents might or might \nnot feel that they had a voice in decision-making.   \n \nVariables \n \nThose who settled in academically oriented project roles were likely to be \ncomfortable with a certain amount of ambiguity and tension, finding that this enabled \nthem to exercise a degree of autonomy in setting their own agendas: \n\u201cI\u201fve always worked at interfaces\u2026 I\u201fve never been mainstream and I\u201fve \nalways enjoyed being at the interface, and although I will use it, and \noccasionally say \u201ewell of course we\u201fre just the marginalized\u201f; but no, that\u201fs \nwhere I like to be. I like to be where it doesn\u201ft matter if you bend the rules or \ndo things differently or\u2026 no one is quite taking any notice\u2026\u201d (learning \npartnerships manager, UK) \nLearning to accommodate and work with dissonance became a modus operandi, with \na reliance on personal agency as opposed to organisational structures or information \nflows: \n\u201c\u2026 I\u201fve had to create my own role, find my own ways into systems and force \nmy way into meetings, rather than wait for someone to ask me to contribute\u201d \n(learning technology manager, UK) \n \n 13 \nThis was particularly the case in the UK and Australia, perhaps reflecting the fact that \nsuch roles were less established and recognised than in the US. There was a sense that \nindividuals could not necessarily draw on positional authority or expertise, and had to \nbuild their own credibility outside organisational safety nets: \n\u201cThere\u201fs no authority that you come with\u201d (policy and planning manager, UK) \n\u201cIt\u201fs what you are, not what you represent\u201d (learning partnerships manager, \nUK) \nFurthermore, being able to take the part of academic colleagues, for instance, \nunderstanding academic work rhythms, and the possible disjunction with time and \nbudgetary parameters, was an important element in progressing their projects, as well \nas in building confidence and trust. As one respondent put it, academic colleagues \ntended to take the view that \u201cIf you solve a problem for us, we\u201fll come back and work \nwith you again\u201d (learning and teaching manager, UK). \n \nThus, while \u201ehard\u201f factors such as institutional structures were significant in defining \nthe type of space available for those in academically oriented project roles, it was also \napparent that \u201esoft\u201f factors, such as the attitudes of and relationships with colleagues, \nwere likely to have a stronger influence on the roles of individuals. Therefore those in \nintegrated space such as an office of institutional research might or might not have a \nvoice in institutional decision-making.  In addition to the agency adopted by the \nindividual, and the type of organisational space that they found themselves working \nin, the following variables were also apparent across all three countries: \n \n\uf0b7 The flexibility of organisational \u201crules and resources\u201d (Giddens 1991). \n\uf0b7 The influence of senior manager(s) in encouraging an innovative approach to \nthe development of a specific project area. \n\uf0b7 The scope that existed for individuals to develop their project in ways in \nwhich they judged to be appropriate. \n\uf0b7 The nature of the project and the stage of its development. \n\uf0b7 The influence of team members, external partners and colleagues. \n \nHowever, there is undoubtedly scope, particularly in straitened economic times, for \nperceptions that academically oriented project work reduces rather than expands the \nspace for disciplinary activity, and consumes resources that might otherwise be used \nfor the latter. Even where the potential for joint working is acknowledged, some \ncommentators continue to see this as involving a division of labour between academic \nand professional staff, with a loss of control on the part of academic staff, rather than \nas a mutual and collaborative endeavour: \n\uf0b7 \u201ca \u201emarriage\u201f between professionalism and managerialism [involves] \nacademics losing some control over the goals and social purposes of their \nwork\u2026\u201d (Kogan and Teichler, 2007: 11).  \n\uf0b7 \u201cthe use of instructional information technology \u201eunbundles\u201f traditional \nfaculty instructional practices, breaking down the teaching function into \nmultiple, discrete parts, reducing professors to content experts\u201d (Rhoades, \n2007: 6) \nOthers, for instance, Macfarlane (2007; 2011), see this as reducing the role of \nmainstream academic staff as \u201cacademic citizens\u201d, so that \u201cmore often than not \nundertaking a hybrid role was seen as a struggle and sometimes even \ndysfunctional\u2026\u201d (Macfarlane 2011: 71). \n \n 14 \nAn alternative view would be that academically oriented activity releases academic \nstaff to focus on disciplinary and research activity that interests them, especially in \nperiods of retrenchment when academic staff are obliged to account more closely for \ntheir time in relation to mainstream teaching and research, and have less time for \npastoral and support activities: \n\u201cthe push within our university is very much to try and relieve the \nadministrative burden off academic staff; that needs to happen and some \nacademics are reluctant to give it away\u201d (student services manager, Australia). \nThere are also signs that such contributions are sought and appreciated: \n\u201cI think there are increasingly role models showing that you can actually have \na voice. And it\u201fs not about taking over academic decision-making. It\u201fs about \nadding value rather than negating the contribution of academic staff\u2026 [we] as \na group have been able to change some policies in areas where we\u201fve in the \npast been told \u201eget lost\u201f\u201d (faculty manager, Australia).  \nAnother respondent had built up expertise in advising academic staff about the \nauthoring of funding bids, including drafting sections of such bids so as to meet the \ncriteria of funding bodies, with significant success rates. Internal consultant roles \ncould also be seen as an example of a casualisation of (particularly) academic roles, \nalthough they might suit individuals who prefer building a portfolio of experience in \ndifferent spheres, so as to leave options open for the future. Such individuals may be \nof increasing value to institutions in bringing a range of experience to bear, \nparticularly those from practice disciplines and\/or with project expertise. \n \nImplications of academically oriented project roles \n \nThe increasing range of identities with academic components, some of which might \nnot be fully recognised in formal organisational frameworks, widens the scope of \ncareer pathways for academic staff. For instance, they have the possibility of: \n\uf0b7 making a career of academically oriented project work \n\uf0b7 moving in and out of project work but staying in higher education \n\uf0b7 reverting to mainstream academiamaking a career in another sector eg \npolicy\/funding agencies,business\/industry, NGOs or third sector.It also raises \nquestions about how the contributions of individuals might be optimised, both in \nterms of their own career futures and of contemporary institutional missions. Issues \narise around, for instance the weightings that might be accorded to applied research \nand practice, publication records, and contributions to external networks and \npartnerships vis-\u00e0-vis rewards, incentives, and career advancement. Individual cases \nmay need to be judged on a one-off basis, with no institutional guidelines or direct \ncomparators. This is likely to be particularly acute when there are mixed teams of \nstaff within a single project or unit. Thus: \n\u201cNone of the work we do\u2026 makes any sense outside the context of a \nfaculty\u2026 or of students in departments, whether it\u201fs learning support, or \ncounselling, or an administrative process\u2026 yet there is a difficult leadership \nrole in integrating and managing the staff in the unit who are a combined \ngroup of academic and administrative staff undertaking similar work with \ndifferent working conditions and entitlements\u201d (learning support manager, \nAustralia). \n \nDifficulties were also mentioned in relation to conditions of service, intellectual \nproperty, and entitlement to support for conferences. In a US institution there was \n 15 \nalso an issue about institutional researchers being funded to go to conferences and \ngive papers, partly in order to gain intelligence for the institution about issues such as \nrecruitment, when funding might not be available for mainstream academic staff \nwanting to go to conferences in their discipline. Ongoing negotiation is likely to be \nrequired about such issues, alongside recognition of more flexible career pathways \nwith opportunities for crossover, exit and re-entry, along the lines of, for instance, \nStrike\u201fs \u201ccareer climbing frame\u201d (Strike 2010). \n \nAlthough respondents in the study generally took the view that their projects \nrepresented an enhancement of their roles and identities, there was the possibility that, \nas one respondent with a scientific background put it, academic colleagues would \nconsider you a \u201cfailed scientist\u201d: \n\u201cthat\u201fs still something that a lot of people who have made a move out of \nresearch have to battle with\u2026 often I think by people who wish they had done \nso\u2026 I prefer to be more in a leadership role for something that\u201fs project \nrelated, that\u201fs innovative\u2026\u201d (research manager, Australia). \nFurthermore, although respondents themselves continued to see themselves as \nacademics, there could also be adverse reactions from academic colleagues to the \nvalue of project oriented work, even if it involved research (which was likely to have \na practical, Mode 2 bias): \n\u201c\u2026you\u201fre not regarded as a real academic, and yet I\u201fve probably done more \nas an academic than many academics have done this year\u2026 The interesting \nthing is, the research I\u201fm doing on university corporate partnerships has given \nme an area of expertise to do with \u201ebusiness\u201f that [is regarded] as dirty, and \nnot as real academic stuff\u201d (partnerships manager, Australia). \nThis was echoed by a widening participation manager in the UK, who described \nnegative attitudes to their unit\u201fs research as being seen as \u201ctrade or dirty work\u201d. \n \nThere could also be tensions around the fact that a doctorate does not automatically \nconfer the skills required to undertake a specific role. Thus:  \n\u201cI have a couple of PhDs on my staff. They were trained to do research as a \nPhD, which you can\u201ft do\u2026 you can\u201ft give a dissertation to a provost or a \nchancellor. They want the one pager. So you have this disconnect between \nhow you present the data and the style in which to present it\u201d (institutional \nresearcher, US). \nLearning how to present material in an appropriate format, including where necessary \n\u201csound bites\u201d (for instance for politicians), was therefore a significant dimension to \nacademically oriented project work. Another respondent saw the need to develop \nspecific technical skills: \n\u201cthere\u201fs this disjunction coming out of an academic research background \nwhere I have the conceptual and the writing skills, probably at a much higher \nlevel of mastery than people in the field I\u201fm in; but what they have that I don\u201ft \nhave are really highly developed technical skills, and I work with that. I work \nbetween the cracks\u2026 I recently decided that in terms of professional \ndevelopment, what I really need to do is to upgrade my technical skills\u201d \n(institutional researcher, US). \n \nAt a practical level, the location of academically oriented projects could also lead to \ninappropriate line management arrangements whereby, for instance, someone with \nsignificant academic content to their role was managed by someone with mainstream \n 16 \nfunctional responsibilities. Perhaps for this kind of reason, there were respondents \nwho considered that having low visibility and\/or ambiguous organisational \npositioning could be an advantage, allowing more scope for autonomous activity. As \none Australian respondent reflected, \u201cThe model where we almost disappear is not a \nbad one\u2026\u201d, because it allowed the activities of learning support staff to \u201cmerge\u201d with \nthose of academic colleagues, and the two groups to work seamlessly together. This \nsuggests that, at times, it was necessary to use a degree of dissemblance in order to \nmake things work, particularly in Australia, where there appeared to be a stronger \nsense of the academic\/non-academic binary, and less recognition of academically \noriented project identities per se. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe studies suggest that the terms \u201eacademic\u201f and \u201enon-academic\u201f no longer represent \na clear binary division in higher education, and that there is a spectrum of activity that \ninvolves staff with academic credentials and experience, even though they may be \nemployed on non-academic or split contracts. Academic identities, therefore, are both \nexpanding and becoming more heterogeneous. Moreover, being involved in broadly \nbased, academically oriented institutional projects appears to be a positive choice for \nsome individuals who could have gone in either an academic, or a more project-\noriented direction. Three models of academically oriented activity were identified as \nbeing integrated within institutional structures and agendas, semi-autonomous as a \nresult of being partly or fully self-funding, and independent, whereby respondents \ntended to work around existing structures on their own initiative. It was suggested \nthat organisational arrangements involving semi-autonomous units, dedicated to a \nbroad project area, provided the optimal conditions for academically oriented \nidentities to flourish, although the approaches of the senior management team, as well \nas the agency of individuals, were also contributory factors.  \n \nFurthermore, the contribution of people with academic credentials, but also specialist \nskills in areas such as the design of online programmes and bids for funding, are \nlikely to continue to be required to support the academic endeavour of both \nindividuals and institutions in contemporary environments. Notwithstanding national \nand institutional variables, the development of academically oriented project work \nappears to both co-exist with and extend mainstream academic activity. Not only are \nthere more spaces for those with academic credentials and experience to inhabit in the \ncontemporary university, but also more possibilities for them to develop non-\nmainstream careers in the longer term. This suggests that \u201cconstructive interaction\u201d \n(Kolsaker 2008: 523) between academic and project oriented activity is likely to be \nongoing. Furthermore, individuals in these roles are likely to add to the \u201cplurality of \nvoices\u201d and a \u201cre-imagining of academic identities\u201d in higher education (Fanghanel \n2012: 81). However, the recognition accorded to these roles and identities varies \naccording to national and institutional cultures and traditions. Both institutions and \nindividuals, therefore, may wish to think about how they articulate the added value \nthat they bring, to themselves and to colleagues.  \n \nReferences \n \n 17 \nAarrevaara, T. and S.
