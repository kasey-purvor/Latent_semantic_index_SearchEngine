We have re-\ncently demonstrated negative differential resistance in a-C\nquantum well structures.18 In this letter, we explore the prop-\nerties of a-CNx \/Si devices grown at room temperature by\ncarefully controlling the band gap, density of states at the\nFermi level \u0001EF\u0002, and height of the tunnel barrier. In these\na-CNx \/Si heterostructures, we show features similar to those\nobserved in state of the art direct tunnel devices with nega-\ntive differential conductance.16\nThe samples were prepared by ablation of a high purity\ngraphite target \u000199.99%\u0002 using a 248 nm pulsed UV excimer\nlaser \u0001Lambda Physik LPX 210i\u0002. By choosing different laser\nfluences \u00014 and 16 J \/cm2\u0002 and partial pressures of nitrogen\n\u00015 and 100 mT\u0002 in the deposition chamber, films A and B\nwere fabricated. This gives a large variation of sp3 bonded\ncarbon and nitrogen doping levels in the samples, which\nhelps control the band gap \u0001Eg\u0002 in the range of 1\u20132.5 eV,\nrespectively. These samples, up to 20 nm thick, were depos-\nited at room temperature on n-type Si \u0001111\u0002 wafers \u0001resistiv-\nity \u00030.01 \u0001 cm\u0002 to make a-CNx \/Si heterostructures. The\ntop contact of each device \u0001diameter of 200 \u0002m\u0002 was depos-\nited by evaporating an \u0003100 nm thick layer of gold.\nThe diode characteristics for sample A demonstrate weak\nrectification behavior, which is improved by up to two orders\nof magnitude for sample B, where a larger Eg \u0001\u00032 eV\u0002 is\npresent \u0004Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002 and 1\u0001b\u0002\u0005. Comparing this with the low\ntemperature characteristics we observe for sample A, the tun-\nneling current does not show any significant change with\ntemperature except at very low bias, close to zero \u0001not shown\nhere\u0002.

We explain these features, particularly for\nsample B, using the standard MIS tunnel diode model.16\nSample B possesses a band gap almost twice that of n+-Si\nand the transfer of electrons from low Eg \u0001of Si\u0002 to high Eg\n\u0001of a-CNx\u0002 causes an abrupt band bending of the conduction\nband \u0001EC\u0002 at the junction. At forward bias, the barrier to\nelectrons gets reduced and the tunnel current shows strong\nnonlinear behavior \u0001also, in sample A where Eg is nearly\nequal to Si\u0002. From Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002 for sample B, we observe some\ndepletion of charge at low bias, followed by a weak and a\nstrong inversion at higher bias.\nIn reverse bias, tunneling of electron from metal to\na-CNx \/Si gives accumulation of charge at the junction and\nthe conduction is governed by thermionic emission. Consid-\nering the presence of either a potential barrier or Coulomb-\nlike traps in the DLC films, this can be attributed to the\nPoole-Frenkel \u0001PF\u0002 conduction, where log\u0001I\u0002 changes lin-\nearly with V1\/2.9 From the V1\/2 dependence of ln\u0001I\u0002, in the\nlow reverse bias region for sample A, we attempt to explain\nthe data on the basis of a Schottky contact or PF conduction\n\u0004Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002, left inset\u0005. However, an absence of linearity sug-\ngests that the variable range hopping or PF conduction is not\nthe dominant mechanism for current conduction due to the\nabsence of sufficient density of deep traps.\nTo fit the current for these devices in the low forward\nbias, the expression for MIS tunnel diodes based on a barrier\njunction \u0001junction barrier \u0003b and tunnel barrier \u0003t\u0002 as16\nI = A \u0001 T2 exp\u0006\u2212 2\u00072m*\n\u0004\n\b1\/2\u0001q\u0005t\u00021\/2d\t\u0001exp\n\u2212 e\u0005b\/kT\u000b\u0002\n\u0006\u0006exp eV\n\u0007kT\n\u2212 1\t . \u00011\u0002\nFrom the fit to the forward bias I-V data, recorded at\ndifferent temperatures, and the plot of ln\u0001I0 \/T2\u0002 vs 1\/T, we\nextract values for the \u0003b and the diode idelity factor \u0001\u0007\u0002\n\u0004Figs. 2\u0005. The decrease of the reverse bias saturation current\n\u0001I0\u0002 with the decrease of \u2212V could be due to lowering of \u0003b.\nThe effective value of the Richardsons constant A* is found\nto be \u00038 A\/K2 cm2, which points to a small value for m* of\ncarbon \u00010.06me\u20130.07me\u0002 and suggests potential applications\nin the form of fast tunnel devices for carbon. The tunneling\nprobability, Tt\u0003exp\u0004\u22122\u00012m* \/h2\u00021\/2\u0001q\u0003t\u00021\/2d\u0005, would in-\ncrease with carrier density \u0001ND\u0002 through doping \u0001here nitro-\ngenated n-type a-C\u0002, which also controls the band gap and\nthe barrier heights.16 However, for a-C having low values of\nm* through optimizing the barrier thickness \u0001d\u0002 of the order\nof 10 nm, a value of Tt\u000310\u221210 can be achieved. It can even\ncontribute to the tunneling current at room temperatures\nshowing negative differential resistance \u0001NDR\u0002 features.12\nAlso, if we consider variations of the thickness of carbon\nfilms, then the thinnest part of the films can be considered for\nhighest Tt. Therefore, for \u0003b\u00031 V and d\b10 nm, up to 10\u22126\nof Tt can be achieved. The value of \u0003b varies in the range of\n0.5\u20131 V, which seems to be consistent with the measured\nband gaps of the samples and corresponds to a low density of\ngap states of carbon \u0001\b1016 eV\u22121 cm\u22123\u0002.13 Also, based on the\nincrease of \u0003b by more than three times for sample B, com-\npared to sample A, we understand that the trap density is\nreduced for sample B. The activation energy calculated from\nln\u0001I0\u0002\u0002 vs 1\/T plots appears to be very small \u000130\u201360 meV\u0002,\nsuggesting thermionic emission of carriers in the forward\nbias. The value of \u0007 varies around 20 \u0001within 18\u201321\u0002 for\nsample A and around 60 for sample B in the whole tempera-\nture range and may be considered as temperature invariant. A\nsimilar high value of \u0007 was reported in porous silicon and\nalso in metal\/DLC\/n-Si\/Ag structures.8 In the present struc-\nture direct tunneling through the carbon is the dominant\nmechanism which can explain these features. We also note\nthat although the parameter e \/\u0007kT changes sharply at high\ntemperatures for sample A, it saturates at low temperature\n\u0001\b200 K\u0002 for sample B, which supports the observation of\ndirect tunneling in the present system \u0001Fig. 2\u0002.5 From these\nanalyses we understand that in addition to Schottky barrier\nemission, tunneling contributes to the total current, which\ndepends on both \u0003b and \u0003t in the present devices, unlike\nwhat was previously suggested for DLC films \u0001see Fig. 3\u0002.15\nThe strong nonlinearity or NDR features in I-V character,\nwhich appear from the difference of Eg at the junction of two\nn-type semiconductors and a shift of EF towards EC, suggests\na large deviation from the diode ideality factor due to tun-\nneling and low density of interface states in a-CNx.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the energy band diagram for the\na-CNx \/n+c-Si heterojunction at zero bias. The surface poten-\ntials of silicon \u0001\tc-Si\u0002 and a-CNx \u0001\ta-CNx\u0002 films are 0.18 and\n0.35 eV, respectively. The work functions for these two ma-\nterials, represented by \na-Si and \na-CNx are 4.33 and 3 eV,\nrespectively. Controlling tunnel barrier \u0003t appears to be very\nimportant but this has been found challenging for a-C films\nin previous studies.12,15 The addition of nitrogen could de-\ncrease the band gap and shift EF from the valence band \u0001EV\u0002\ntowards EC.10\u201312,19 As a result, \u0003b or built in potential at the\nmetal\/a-CNx junction and \u0003t at \u0001a-CNx\/Si\u0002 will change in\nthe range of 0.5\u20131 and 1.5 eV, respectively. We think that\ndue to improper choice of d beyond several nanometers and\nEg \u0001i.e., \u0003t\u0002 for thick DLC films15 and for ultrathin and con-\nducting a-C:H films,13 no effect of direct tunneling has been\nreported to date. It appears that the effect of tunneling at\nroom temperature is small in the more conducting sample A,\nwhich acts as a conventional heterostructure or Schottky bar-\nrier junction diode or MIS tunnel diode, with a very low\nFIG. 2. log\u0001I0 \/T2\u0002 vs 1\/T and ideality factor vs 1\/T plot in forward bias for\n\u0001a\u0002 sample A and \u0001b\u0002 sample B.\n082105-2 S.

This is because for\nsample A, the formation of a shallow donor level in the ma-\nterial by nitrogen incorporation is possible, which then shifts\nEF close to EC. In Fig. 3, the structure is similar to a MIS\ntunnel diode with a high value of \u0003b and \u0003t assisting direct\ntunneling. Here we have presented some estimated values for\n\n and \t which agree with previous reports.9,12,16\nPrevious studies on the photosensitivity of carbon-\nsilicon heterojunctions showed promise for developing\ncarbon-based optoelectronics, including photodetectors.20,21\nAt present the increase of current from sample A under illu-\nmination by at least two orders of magnitude is shown in\nFig. 4. We think that the photogeneration of carriers takes\nplace in the depletion region or within the a-CNx films and\nphotoconduction takes place in the bands separated by a\nlarge band gap.19,11 From the photocurrent of the present\nheterojunction we think that donor states in a-CNx films can\nact as recombination centers that recombines with holes\n\u0001minority carriers\u0002 in the a-CNx films and produce an en-\nhanced photocurrent, which could be useful in solar cell ap-\nplications and photodetectors.\nIn summary, we show that by controlling the deposition\nparameters in a-CNx films, we are able to control the effec-\ntive tunnel barrier height through nitrogen doping of carbon\nand show heterojunction and MIS properties of these de-\nvices. We think that the observation of direct tunneling\nthrough the junction would be helpful for the fabrication of\nhigh-speed carbon based MIS tunnel diodes and other fast\ndevices.\nOne of the authors \u0001S.B.\u0002 is very much thankful to S.
