There is now a new policy rationale for the consideration of \nnew-build nuclear power in the context of climate change and a low carbon economy.  \nIn a rapidly evolving public policy context there is a strategic need for a clearer picture of public and \ncommunity perceptions of nuclear power and wider community issues, and for examining whether such \ninsight can be integrated into policy and decision-making processes. \n \nThe paper explores the state of public and community perceptions of nuclear power in Britain, at several \nlevels, assessing potential factors likely to govern future responses to nuclear power. \n 1\n \n \nCurrent \u2018Public Perceptions\u2019 of Nuclear Energy \n \nOver the past year or so, a number of quantitative opinion surveys have sought to assess current UK public \nattitudes towards nuclear power.  \n \nResearch by MORI on behalf of BNFL, British Energy and Nirex has suggested that public support for \nnuclear power is relatively low in comparison to that for other (renewable) energy technologies. Thus in \nDecember 2004, a MORI\/BNFL poll found that just 28% of those surveyed responded positively to the \nquestion \u2018How favourable or unfavourable are your overall opinions or impressions of the nuclear \nindustry\/nuclear energy?\u2019 \n \nDespite this low figure, successive recent MORI polls indicate public perceptions of nuclear power may be \nimprovingi. In July 2001, when asked the question \u2018How favourable or unfavourable are your overall \nopinions or impressions of the nuclear industry\/nuclear energy?\u2019 49% expressed \u2018unfavourable\u2019 \nimpressions, compared with 19% recording \u2018favourable\u2019 impressions. By contrast, in December 2004, 26% \nexpressed \u2018unfavourable\u2019 impressions, compared to 28% \u2018favourable\u2019 impressions. In addition, the \npercentage of people expressing opposition to \u2018the building of new nuclear power stations in Britain to \nreplace those being phased out over the next few years\u2019 was noted as having fallen from 60% in July 2001, \nto 30% in December 2004. Knight suggests such results indicate that \u2018public support for nuclear now \noutweighs opposition in the UK for the first time in over five years\u2019. Similar recent research published by \nMori for EDF suggests that \u2018the public accepts, albeit reluctantly, that nuclear energy has a place in the \noverall energy balance (54% agree)\u2019, specifically in the context of the increasing emphasis on global \nwarming and security of supply.ii  \n \nHowever, according to a May 2005 ICM poll for BBC, a rather lower percentage (21%) of respondents \nsupported the proposition that nuclear represented \u2018the most feasible way of meeting the UK\u2019s future \nenergy needs while reducing carbon dioxide\u2019. This survey found that 52% of respondents considered it \nwrong for \u2018the government to consider nuclear power as an energy source for the future\u2019, compared to 39% \nwho considered it right.  \n \nSimilarly, a poll undertaken in July 2005 by Populus, for The Times newspaper, found that only 18% of \nrespondents expressed a preference for building new nuclear power stations as a desirable means of \nmeeting a projected shortfall in Britain\u2019s energy needs following the phasing-out of existing nuclear power \nstations, compared to 79% who favoured \u2018investing in (other) energy generating plants, particularly \nrenewables\u2019. The same poll reported that a majority (59%) of respondents felt closest to the statement \n\u2018nuclear waste problems remain and it would be irresponsible to build new nuclear power stations\u2019.  \n \nA report by Wouter Poortinga and Nick Pidgeon for the Leverhulme Trust, reported on the results of a \nquantitative survey (carried out by MORI) covering perceptions of five key risk issues: climate change, \nradiation from mobile phones, radioactive waste, genetically modified food and genetic testing. The authors \nconcluded that of the five risk issues, \u2018Radioactive waste is the most contentious risk case. \u2026 About half of \nthe respondents felt that Radioactive Waste was a \u201cvery bad thing\u201d\u2019. The authors also reported that in \nrelation to questions of risk, \u2018the least trusted information sources were national government and the \nEuropean Union\u2019 (p. 55).iii \n \n 2\n \n \nA report, carried out in September 2004, by the Laboratory for Energy and the Environment at MIT reported \non a survey of attitudes towards energy and environmental issues. The survey suggested that \u2018nuclear \nenergy continues to be confused as a greenhouse emitter and the technology attracts both strong support \nand opposition\u2019. iv \n \nMore generally, findings from a number of current quantitative opinion research surveys on UK energy \noptions have been collated in a desk study carried out by the EPSRC on behalf of RCUK. This study \nreviewed over 30 recent surveys and opinion polls on public attitudes towards different energy generation \noptions. Key findings included that:  \n \nAttitudes to future energy generation technologies are strongly in favour of \nrenewable energy technologies. Around two thirds of the UK public is in favour of \nfurther investments in renewable energies (or wind energy in particular) as \ncompared to one third or less for nuclear power. This relation is more or less stable \nover the last five years. v \n \nThe same study reported that, although nuclear energy might contribute to a broad policy of reducing CO2, \n\u2018for a majority in the UK negative aspects of nuclear such as waste disposal seem to outweigh this \nadvantage\u2019.vi \n \nOverall therefore, the message from recent public opinion research appears to be that public attitudes and \nopinion toward nuclear energy \u2013 as the primary way of meeting future energy needs \u2013 are currently broadly \nunfavourable. In raw terms, recent data suggest that only between 21-28% of respondents favour nuclear \npower.  \n \nIt needs to be borne in mind that, as reported in a recent analysis, What the Polls Tell Us, during the period \nover which most of these polls were conducted, nuclear power as an issue has lacked \u2018salience\u2019 for the \npublic at large, in that people have been responding in a context where there has been little meaningful \npublic or political focus on the issue.vii Recent government statements about climate change and the \nassociated need for fresh energy investments may be changing this \u2013 which could explain the signals that a \nminority of perceptions of nuclear power may have been moving in a somewhat more positive direction. \n \nAssessing Pre-Existing Concerns \n \nSo far, this discussion of recent poll findings has focused principally on simple Yes\/No responses towards \nnuclear power. \n \nHowever, implicit in much of the same research has been an observable persistence of specific and long-\nstanding public concerns vis a vis such issues as radioactive waste management, trustworthiness of \ngovernment, industrial secrecy, and nuclear proliferation. Whilst some of the quantitative research suggests \nthat \u2018new\u2019 factors \u2013 such as climate change, security of supply, and decommissioning \u2013 may play an \nimportant role in framing future responses, current perceptions appear to be influenced by pre-existing and \nlatent understandings of both nuclear energy and the nuclear industry. \n \nThus both polls and quantitative research point to the continuing importance for many members of the \npublic of long-standing concerns arising from previous historical experience: \n \n 3\n \n \n1. Many people assess the merits of possible new nuclear station construction in the light of the \nunresolved issues of safe disposal of radioactive waste and secure decommissioning of existing \nfacilities. Recurrently, satisfactory solutions to these issues emerge as preconditions for looking \nmore favourably on any new nuclear proposals. Moreover, existing research has demonstrated a \nwidespread perception that there may be \u2018no solution\u2019 to the radioactive waste issue;viii  \n \n2. Public perceptions of new nuclear energy investment appear to be influenced strongly by \nwidespread lack of trust in national and European governments and industry either to tell the truth \nor to take adequate responsibility, should something go wrong. ix \n \nAlongside such ongoing concerns there is also some evidence of public appreciation of potential benefits of \nnuclear energy, including security of supply, cleaner air and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. \nMore favourable perceptions of nuclear energy appear to be contingent on there being a projected future \nmix of energy generation sources. Thus there appears to be some support for a continued role for nuclear \nenergy in the context of a diverse mix of energy technologies, a finding which is not obvious in polls \nstructured around a simple choice between nuclear or renewables or maintenance of status quo  \n \nNevertheless, there is also qualitative research which tends to confirm the significance of longer-standing \nconcerns for public attitudes. As part of the Government\u2019s Energy Review in 2002, the DTI commissioned a \nwide-ranging public and stakeholder consultation exercise. This included focus groups run by UK CEED, a \nset of community workshops run by the New Economics Foundation, and a web-based consultation \nprocess administered by Dialogue by Design.x \n \nThis research found that members of the public consulted \u2018held wide-ranging views on nuclear power \u2013 \nfrom those who were completely opposed to its use, to those who supported it\u2019xi. It suggested that a portion \nof the opposition to nuclear power was based on principle, and was therefore unlikely to change. However, \nthere appeared also to be a large body of opinion which was both concerned and yet undecided. There was \nsome consensus that for this group certain key factors influenced judgements about the nuclear industry. \nAmongst these, the waste issue was seen as of critical importance, including a widely-held perception that \nthere was currently no acceptable solution to its long-term secure management. On-going perceptions of \nthe industry as inherently secretive also contributed to negative perceptions. Moreover, over and above \nsuch specific factors, a key finding of the deliberative research was the highly conditional nature of any \npossible shift in attitudes towards new nuclear investments. Thus: \n \nThe most controversial and complex element of the debates on energy mix concerned nuclear \npower: in all the processes there were strong views for (e.g. it is a low-carbon option) and against \n(e.g. safety concerns), and a large body of concerned but undecided opinion. Waste management \nwas a dominant issue for all shades of opinion on nuclear power, with many people unable to \nenvisage acceptable solutions to the problem of waste disposal. In the focus groups and \nworkshops a highly conditional view began to emerge, with acknowledgement that nuclear power \nwon\u2019t go away, alongside a reluctance to accept it except under very stringent conditions \u2013 for \nexample, rejecting new building until waste storage issues are dealt with more effectively. \n(emphasis added)xii \n \nIn an important sense therefore, the quantitative and qualitative research findings considered above point \nstrongly to an in-built provisionality in current UK public orientations towards nuclear power.  \n \n 4\n \n \nThis framework, we suggest, can be expected to play an important role in shaping future public responses, \nas it has done in the past. Earlier experience of nuclear controversy suggests that such matters will help \ndetermine the all-important social relations associated with the technology, and hence the ways in which \npublic attitudes towards it may evolve. How things develop from this point will depend on what happens \nnext, in relation not only to the radioactive waste issue, but also to the development of the particular \npolitical, institutional and industrial framework which UK nuclear power might be expected to develop.  \n \nBefore expanding on this point, comment must be made on the ways in which the very notion of \u2018public \nperceptions\u2019 tends to be conceptualised and represented within the UK policy community.   \n \nConceptualising \u2018Public Perceptions\u2019 \n \nOfficial representations of public views and concerns about a particular technology as \u2018perceptions\u2019 convey \nthe impression that they are somehow \u2018soft\u2019 and insubstantial, by comparison with more \u2018real\u2019 material \ndimensions such as safety, performance, economic viability, and environmental effects \u2013 all of which are \nheld to be measurable in supposedly robust objective terms.  \n \nSuch a tendency is misleading in at least two respects.  \n \nFirstly, it fosters the impression that public reactions are only coincidently related to \u2018the facts\u2019 about the \ntechnology in question (facts which are supposedly represented definitively through the officially \nrecognised, more material analytical categories). By contrast, the record suggests that on nuclear-related \nissues such as economic viability, the challenges of secure waste management, radiation uncertainties, \nand the commercial implications of prospective regulatory pressures, wider public understandings have in \nthe past proved more realistic than many of those of the industry or government.    \n \nSecondly, it obscures the extent to which reactions by citizens may rest on a body of understanding of a \ntechnology as experienced in the real world on lines unrecognised by \u2013 and hence unrepresented in - \nsupposedly objective official assessment processes. \n \nThere are echoes here of recent UK experience with GM crops: Throughout the early- and mid-1990s, the \nformalised scientific Risk Assessment procedures of the Advisory Committee on Releases to the \nEnvironment (ACRE) and other official bodies were asserted by government to be capturing all relevant \u2013 \nand hence legitimate - issues and concerns about GM crops. (Questions posed in quantitative opinion polls \nabout GM issues over the same period tended to reflect similar categories of understanding.)  \n \nBut in the event, these methods proved inadequate and misleading. Following political controversy in the \nlate 1990s, a series of inquiries and reports by the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission \n(2001, 2003), the GM Nation? Steering Board (2003), the Prime Minister\u2019s Strategy Unit (2003) and the GM \nScience Panel (2003) revealed the central importance of a range of substantive social, economic and \nscientific disagreements and uncertainties associated with the technology lying beyond the purview of the \nofficial evaluation methods. Such disagreements and uncertainties had earlier been pictured officially as \nmerely insubstantial \u2018public perceptions\u2019. They have since been incorporated as central to UK public policy \non GM.xiii \n \nWynne (2001) and others have argued that such processes of continuing official marginalisation of what \nproved subsequently to be valid and legitimate dimensions of concern have actively fed the public mistrust \n 5\n \n \nof government which constituted such an important element of the UK\u2019s GM-related crisis of legitimacy in \nthe late 1990s.xiv \n \nIn the present context, this suggests that, in considering \u2018public perceptions\u2019 of nuclear power \u2013 and in \nparticular, how these might be expected to develop - it is important to go behind official categories and \nunderstandings, to see what kinds of dynamics could be set in motion should a programme of new power \nstations become a serious likelihood. \n \nEarlier Controversies and the \u2018Social Constitution\u2019 of Technologies \n \nIn the 1970s and 1980s, there was continuing public controversy surrounding civil nuclear power, in Britain \nand elsewhere.  \n \nOn the one hand, these controversies focused on issues of safety, waste management, and economic \nviability. At a succession of public inquiries (Torness, Windscale\/ Sellafield, Sizewell, Hinkley etc), there \nwas protracted argument by NGOs and others about such matters.xv  \n \nBut beyond this, a range of further concerns in society at large were reflected in and through the civil \nnuclear issue, in a way that lifted it above other, more \u2018conventional\u2019 environmental disputes, crystallising in \nwhat some sociologists have termed a social movement. We have argued elsewhere that the particular \nsocial intensity of the arguments around nuclear power over the period 1973-1989 \u2018reflected not simply \n\u2018technical\u2019 issues held to be legitimate by governments and scientists, but also wider social relations in \nwhich the particular technology was embedded (indeed of which it was judged to be a reflection) at [its] \nparticular historical moment\u2019 (emphases added).xvi  \n \nWhat were these \u2018social relations\u2019, and in what ways could they be said to be distinctively \u2018nuclear\u2019 in \ncharacter?  \n \nIn the report, Wising Up, we coined the concept \u2018social constitutions\u2019 of new technologies to help explain \nthis kind of issue.xvii Different technologies bring with them distinctive patterns of relationship with society \u2013 \nthrough the demands of their particular industrial structures, their regulatory requirements, and their \nperceived social \u2018externalities\u2019. In short, they cement and reproduce their own distinctive patterns of social \nrelations.  \n \nThe human experience of these relations may lead technologies to be experienced quite differently, one \nfrom another, in the wider social world. To explore this, Wising Up contrasted information technology (IT) \nand GM crops, pointing to the inherently different \u2018social constitutions\u2019 of the two technological fields, to \nthrow light on the contrasting social receptions experienced by each  - positive and relatively frictionless in \nthe case of IT; sceptical and negative in the case of GM. \n \nIn assessing and comparing the different public responses, the study explored how people\u2019s views and \nconcerns were influenced \u2013 beneath the radar, as it were \u2013 by routine experience and shared \ninterpretations of a number of intersecting technical, social and institutional dynamics associated \nrespectively with IT and GM. Key parameters of comparison included: \n\u2022 openness and diversity of industry structure; \n\u2022 social distribution of associated patterns of expertise; \n 6\n \n \n\u2022 forms of consumer benefit and hazard potential; \n\u2022 perceived retrievability in the event of crisis; \n\u2022 degree of regulatory independence from the state; and \n\u2022 extent of acknowledged uncertainties and ignorance. \n \nIn all of these instances, IT emerged as more flexible, unthreatening and diverse than GM. \n \nThus the suggestion is that public attitudes to the introduction of a new technology may be shaped \nimportantly by people\u2019s experience and expectations of the social relations following from that technology\u2019s \ndevelopment and actualisation in the every-day world. Attitudes are influenced not only by evaluations of \nthe technological option viewed as \u2018hardware\u2019, or by judgements about the technical properties, impacts or \n\u2018risks\u2019 of that option. They also embody responses to the ways in which the innovation is sensed to mesh \nwith wider patterns of human interaction, value, agency, and even overall power distributions within society \nas a whole.  \n \nThese social dimensions of technology are assuming ever-greater significance, as sustainable \ndevelopment priorities become increasingly important, and the economic and social costs of public back-\nlashes (as in the GM case) become more evident. \n \nRecent examinations of the contemporary \u2018science in society\u2019 nexusxviii point to the political importance of \nsuch dynamics, as the potential scope and social purchase of new technologies \u2013 for example in the \nspheres of genomics or nanotechnology \u2013 becomes increasingly far-reaching. What is more, there is now a \ngrowing body of social experience of unanticipated consequences from technological innovation, feeding \nthe public\u2019s capacity to engage in informed argument about such matters. \n \nThe \u2018Social Constitution\u2019 of Civil Nuclear Power \n \nIn the earlier developmental stages of civil nuclear power in Britain \u2013 extending from the 1950s to the late \n1980s - it appeared to be in the nature of the technology that its effective implementation rested on a \ndistinctive set of institutional and industrial arrangements. Four illustrations make the point: \n \n1. the complex and extended nature of the nuclear fuel cycle required (and continues to require) \nexceptionally sustained commitment to costly and integrated national fuel fabrication and waste \nmanagement infrastructures, in parallel with power station development; \n2. its worst-case accident potentials led government to accept unique (and, for a commercial industry, \nprivileged) liability burdens; \n3. the distinctively toxic properties of its fuel components, and their sensitive relationship to nuclear \nproliferation, brought with them a need for unusually robust security arrangements \u2013 now updated \nin the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act: Part 8, \u2018Security of Nuclear Industry\u2019xix; and \n4. the particular capital intensity of its economic profile as an energy producer encouraged reliance on \nthe concept of \u2018series ordering\u2019 of power stations \u2013 carrying the implication of reduced future \nopportunities for public objection at particular proposed power station sites \u2013 in the pursuit of \nnecessary (but so far unachieved) economies of scale. \n \n 7\n \n \nFeatures of these kinds led nuclear power to be understood by many in the 1970s and 1980s as an \nunusually centralising, inflexible and security-sensitive energy technology, over and above any more \nconventional environmental and economic concerns. Such issues lay behind much of the wider social \nresonance of the \u2018anti-nuclear\u2019 movement of that era at both national and local community levels. In other \nwords, the \u2018social constitution\u2019 of civil nuclear power, quite as much as its more readily quantifiable \ndimensions and impacts, helped feed the troubled public attitudes surrounding it.xx \n \nThis history has implications for an understanding of possible movements of public opinion in the \ncircumstances of 2005, where, as suggested by the poll and survey findings cited above, such opinion \nappears to be at best \u2018conditional\u2019, from a predominantly negative starting point. \n \nThe question thus becomes: How might the social relations of civil nuclear power \u2013 its \u2018social constitution\u2019 \u2013 \ncome to develop, as the issue takes on greater public \u2018salience\u2019 in the period immediately ahead?  \n \nFuture Social Relations of Nuclear Power \n \nOn the face of it, much has changed in the nuclear industry since the 1980s. Privatisation, the liberalisation \nof energy markets world-wide, manifest economic weaknesses (with government economic bail-outs of \nSellafield and British Energy), new reactor designs, and the emergence of climate change as a central \nissue for public policy world-wide \u2013 all of these have produced a radically changed context for new nuclear \ninvestment from that which prevailed in the previous era. The centralisation and inflexibility inherent in the \nindustry of that period, which we suggest was formative in the development of public scepticism towards \nthe technology, might be thought now to be a thing of the past. \n \nBut it is too early to say whether this will in fact prove the case. \n  \nIn recent months, there have been significant signals. The Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry \nAssociation (the industry\u2019s spokesman), Keith Parker, has called on government to introduce substantial \nchanges to the licensing and regulatory framework for nuclear power in the UK, if the energy policy \npotential of the technology is to be realised: \u2018If measures were taken \u201cto streamline some of the procedures \nat the beginning around licensing, regulation and the planning system\u201d, then 10 new stations could be up \nand running in 10 years time\u2019, Mr Parker is reported as having claimed in May 2005. xxi  \n \nMore recently, the same spokesman has called for four specific changes. xxii On each of which we \ncomment:  \n \n1. Changes to the UK\u2019s land use planning system, to \u2018reduce delays\u2019 arising from the public inquiry \nsystem.   \n \nOur Comment:   \nIn 2002, the Government withdrew proposals for precisely such changes in its Green Paper, \u2018Major \nInfrastructure Projects: Delivering a Fundamental Change\u2019 (HMS0 2001b), following strong \nParliamentary, NGO and other expert criticism concerning the restrictions on public rights of \nparticipation and objection at both parliamentary and local inquiry levels which such measures \nwould have entailed .  \n \n2. Streamlining of generic licensing procedures for new reactor designs.   \n 8\n \n \n \nOur Comment:  \nSimilar standardising proposals were advanced by the industry in the late 1970s, but rejected \nbecause of the importance of site-specific factors in licensing decisions for new reactor types in the \nUK. \n \n3. Guarantees for a minimum price for nuclear electricity, to prevent it being rendered unprofitable \nshould other means of generating power (arising, for example, from later technological innovation) \nturn out to be cheaper.  \n \nOur Comment:  \nProposals for advance Treasury commitments of this kind to protect private investors over the 40-\nyear lifetimes of specific plants would appear likely to attract major controversy. \n \n4. Guaranteed series-ordering of nuclear stations to ensure economies of scale.   \n \nOur Comment:  \nPrevious industry aspirations to series-ordering of nuclear stations, in 1973 and 1979, proved \nnugatory, because of the industry\u2019s own inability to meet its commitments. Implicit in such \ncumulative ordering patterns would be major constraints on established public inquiry procedures \nand on the potential for subsequent re-evaluations of the resulting policy commitments.   \n \nTaken collectively, such requests appear to represent an attempt to press government to create the \nconditions currently thought necessary by the industry, if effective new nuclear power programmes are to \nbe possible in the UK. \n \nHowever, what is striking is that, if achieved, the resulting measures would re-create very much the \ncentralised and inflexible framework \u2013 and hence, we suggest, much the same \u2018social constitution\u2019 \u2013 which \nproved so publicly provocative in the very different political and economic circumstances of the 1970s and \n1980s.  \n \nWhat is more, it seems reasonable to suppose that, even before such a stage were reached, attempts to \nput in place any one of the measures in question would give the nuclear issue major \u2018salience\u2019 for a variety \nof influential public and expert constituencies, presenting platforms for accumulating public controversy. \n \nIn considering the possible development of \u2018public perceptions\u2019 of nuclear power in the period ahead, there \nare thus reasons for believing the technology continues to be capable of igniting substantial opposition at \nboth national and local levels, on issues to which wider opinion would be sensitive.  \n \nWhether or not this turns out to be the case seems likely to depend on the extent to which other factors \ncould emerge to alter the social relations of the technology in more positive directions. Greatly increased \nopenness and transparency about the economics of the industry, a convincing long-term solution to the \nnuclear waste issue, and the adoption of manifestly \u2018fail-safe\u2019 new reactor types without the associations of \npast ventures (if such can be demonstrated to exist), could conceivably alter the picture to bring about \nshifts in public responsiveness, particularly if coupled to conclusive demonstrations of cumulative CO2-\nsaving benefits. \n \n 9\n \n \n 10\n                                                \nA Coda on Sustainable Energy Policy \n \nGiven the present state of public opinion, as discussed above, the burden of proof now on the nuclear \nindustry and its wider policy community appears to be high one. \n \nViewed from a sustainable development perspective, it seems important that the potentials for renewed \npublic turbulence around the nuclear option \u2013 involving informed bodies of opinion with little interest in the \ntechnical merits of the nuclear energy option as much as those more directly engaged \u2013 should be given \nweight as a substantive factor for evaluation in the policy decision equation.  \n \nAs suggested earlier in this paper, recent experience \u2013 in the GM case for instance \u2013 points to the danger \nof treating public attitudes and the factors shaping them as of secondary significance. Truly sustainable \nenergy policies seem likely to benefit from going with the grain of wider public concerns, rather than from \nrubbing up against them.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis paper was supported by the Sustainable Development Commission. \n \ni Knight, R., 2005: What do the polls tell us.
