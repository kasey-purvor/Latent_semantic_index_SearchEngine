A framework was developed\nfrom the extant literature that was used as a lens for the analysis of supply chains for\nservitized products. This research uses case studies to explore the challenges and\nopportunities that face the supply chain management function within organisations\nthat are pursuing a strategy of servitization. The case studies indicate that servitized\nsupply chains are different to their production counterparts and need to be responsive\nwhich is facilitated by real-time information.\nKeywords: supply chain, products, services, servitization, case study.\n1 Introduction\nLevitt (1983) propounded that business transactions would move from discrete sales\nof products to relationships based on the provision and support of bundles of products\nand services. Vandermerwe and Rada (1988) used the term \u201cservitization\u201d to refer to\nthis bundling of products and services; a strategy that according to Slack et al. (2004)\nis becoming increasingly relevant for manufacturers to improve competitive\nadvantage. Several factors contribute to the increased competitiveness of a strategy of\nservitization:\n\uf0b7 services tend to be more difficult to imitate and lock the user into a long-term\nrelationship (Vandermerwe, 2000);\n\uf0b7 services improve knowledge through an increased insight into how products\nare used (Alonso-Rasgado et al. 2004);\n\uf0b7 services provide a differentiating factor from traditional manufacturing\n(Penttinen and Palmer, 2007);\n\uf0b7 manufacturers that utilise servitization also increase revenues (Oliva and\nKallenberg, 2003) as services tend to have higher margins and can provide a\nstable revenue stream throughout the life of the product (Cohen et al. 2006).\nUsers of servitized products experience enhanced value due to the comprehensive\nnature of the delivered proposition (Vandermerwe, 2000) and improvement in\nthrough-life support (Cohen and Whang, 1997). The nature of servitization dictates\nthat it is mainly used by organisations that supply complex, long-life products that\nrequire through-life support such as aero engine manufacturers (Voss, 2005).\nEffective servitization requires: \u201cthe co-ordination of manufacturing systems,\nmaintenance systems, spare parts supply systems, logistics systems, and so on\u201d (Slack\net al. 2004). Whilst the product is nominally provided by one organisation, services\nand support may be provided by members of their supply network (Cohen et al.\n2006). Furthermore Slack et al. (2004) propose that organisations need to be\nintegrated with their supply chains in a similar fashion to the products and systems\nthat they provide. Therefore, the effective deployment of a strategy of servitization\nencompasses and integrates many more organisational functions and actors and is an\naltogether more complicated proposition than developing an integrated supply chain\nstrategy. This is due to the need to support the product over a period with the\ndownstream supply chain delivering a range of products (e.g. spares, upgrades) and\nservices (e.g. training, maintenance). Thus, the research questions were:\n1. What are, from the extant literature, the key processes within supply chains for\nservitized products?\n2. What are the current practices in the supply chains of organisations that\nprovide and use servitized products?\nThe next section discusses the background to the research in terms of the differences\nbetween supply chains for production and those for support and details how the stages\nof product use influence the characteristics of the supply chain. The following\nsections discuss the methodology used and the case-studies and finishes with a\ndiscussion of the findings and implications for practice.\n2 Literature review\nServitization involves a customer proposition that includes a product and a range of\nassociated services. The delivery of such a proposition requires supply chains\nfocused on the delivery of physical products and others that focus on the delivery of\nservices. Within the physical product supply chain there are two types of demand.\nThese demands are from the manufacture of the products and demand from the\naftermarket support of the product, both of which need to fulfilled from one supply\nchain. The demand between these two types of supply chain is different in nature.\nProduction requirements are stable and known whilst those for the aftermarket are\nsporadic and unpredictable (Cohen et al. 2006). This is further compounded by\nvariances in demand, dependent on the type of sub-system or component, between\nproduction and aftermarket. Further complicating the issue is that aftermarket support\nextends beyond the point at which the product is no longer available to purchase.\nTherefore demand for sub-systems and components will reduce significantly in\nvolume when the product is no longer in production but can extend for many years\nafter production has ceased.\nA major challenge in researching servitized supply chains is the differences between\nproduct and service supply chains, which according Ellram et al. (2004) make most\nsupply chain frameworks inappropriate for services. Furthermore, a servitized supply\nchain requires the careful synchronization of product and service supply chains in\norder to deliver a complete product-service proposition to the customer. In this\nsection the differences between product and service supply chains are analysed and\ndifferent models used to study these two types of supply chains are compared. This\nleads to the development of a framework considered suitable for the analysis of\nsupply chains for servitized products.\nProducts and services are different; as Shostack (1982) posited:\n\u201cProducts are tangible objects that exit in both time and space; services consist solely\nof acts or process(es), and exist in time only\u2026 Services are rendered; products are\npossessed. Services cannot be possessed; they can only be experienced, created or\nparticipated in.\u201d\nMost definitions of supply chain management (SCM) focus on the flows of materials,\ninformation and funds involved in transforming raw materials into final products,\noverlooking the service aspects of the supply chain (Stevens, 1989; Simchi-Levi et al.\n2002; Burt et al. 2003). An exception comes from Ellram et al. (2004) who defined\nSCM for services as: \u201cthe management of information, processes, capacity, service\nperformance and funds from the earliest supplier to the ultimate customer\u201d. For this\nresearch this definition was modified to encompass both products and services,\nleading to the following definition: \u201csupply chain management of servitized products\nis the management of information, processes, capacity (people, equipment and\nfacilities), products, services and funds from the earliest supplier to the ultimate\ncustomer\u201d.\nVarious models and frameworks have been developed to facilitate the analysis of\nproduct supply chains. These include the Supply Chain Operations Reference\n(SCOR) Model (Supply Chain Council, 2001; 2006), the Hewlett-Packard (H-P)\nmodel (Lee and Billington, 1995), the Global Supply Chain Forum (GSCF)\nframework (Cooper et al. 1997), as well as other models presented by Srivastava et al.\n(1999) and Bowersox et al. (1999). Lambert et al. (2005) compared these models and\nconcluded that only the SCOR and GSCF models include business processes that can\nbe used for cross-functional integration and are described in sufficient detail for\nmeaningful comparison.\nEllram et al. (2004) concluded that the H-P and SCOR models are difficult to apply to\na service context although the GSCF model could be adapted to describe the key\nsupply chain processes in a service context. Hence, it was decided to use the GSCF\nmodel as a foundation for the construction of a framework for the key processes in\nsupply chains for servitized products. The GSCF model originally presented by\nCooper et al. (1997) and later modified by Croxton et al. (2001) identifies eight key\nsupply chain management processes which cut across the supply chain. These\nprocesses are depicted in Figure 1.\nTAKE IN FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE\nEllram et al. (2004) proposed that while the structure of the GSCF model appears to\nbe appropriate for the provision of services, the processes are not. They go on to\nsuggest an alternative set of processes which includes:\n\uf0b7 Information Flow;\n\uf0b7 Capacity and Skills Management;\n\uf0b7 Demand Management;\n\uf0b7 Customer Relationship Management;\n\uf0b7 Supplier Relationship Management;\n\uf0b7 Service Delivery Management, and\n\uf0b7 Cash Flow Management.\nAs servitization involves both product and service supply chains the GSCF model\n(Croxton et al. 2001) and the service supply chain model proposed by Ellram et al.\n(2004) was combined. The resultant model deals with the entire range of supply\nchain processes that are required in a servitization context. Table 1 presents a\ncomparison of the GSCF model (Croxton et al. 2001), Ellram et al\u2019s (2004) service\nsupply chain model and proposes a set of processes for the model for the supply chain\nof servitized products. Each of the processes is discussed in more detail below the\nTable.\nTAKE IN TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE\n1. Information Flow Management the GSCF and the service model do not describe\nInformation Flow as a process but a flow that links the various participants in the\nchain (Ellram et al. 2004). For the servitization model it was decided to describe\nit as a management process. This was done as it involves a series of activities that\nenable data to be captured, transmitted and processed to generate information and\nknowledge that is useful for managing the other processes (Ackoff, 1989).\n2. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) refers to the series of activities\nthat provide the structure for maintaining and developing relationships with\ncustomers (Croxton et al. 2001). It includes activities such as understanding\ncustomer needs, tailoring product-service agreements (PSAs) to meet their needs,\nsegmenting customers, monitoring relationships and ensuring customer\nsatisfaction (Croxton et al. 2001; Ellram et al. 2004). Linking CRM to supply\nchain management and other key processes such as product\/service development\nand supplier relationship management has been shown to improve firm\nperformance and increase shareholder value (Srivastiva et al. 1999; Wisner et al.\n2003).\n3. Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) refers to the creation of a structure\nfor managing and developing relationships with suppliers (Croxton et al. 2001;\nLambert et al. 2004). As with CRM, it involves establishing PSAs (Croxton et al.\n2001) or Service Level Agreement [SLAs] (Ellram et al. 2004) with suppliers to\nsupport the relationships. Other activities include the identification and selection\nof suppliers as well as the negotiation and execution of contracts (Ellram et al.\n2004).\n4. Demand Management. In product supply chains, demand management refers to\nthe balancing of customers requirements with supply chain capabilities to reduce\nvariability and uncertainty and increase flexibility (Croxton. et al. 2002). It\nincludes activities such as demand creation, forecasting, planning and inventory\nmanagement (Davis, 1993; Croxton et al. 2002). Additional difficulties exist in\nmanaging demand for service supply chains. This is as demand uncertainty tends\nto be greater in this type of supply chain (Baltacioglu et al. 2007), and it is not\npossible to use inventory to buffer against demand uncertainty (Ellram et al.\n2004).\n5. Production Management is the result of combining two processes from the\noriginal models: Manufacturing Flow Management from the GSCF model\n(Croxton et al. 2001) and Capacity Management from the service supply chain\nmodel (Ellram et al. 2004). Manufacturing Flow Management was defined by\nGoldsby and Garcia-Dastugue (2003) as \u201cthe activities necessary to obtain,\nimplement and manage manufacturing flexibility and move products through the\nplants in the supply chain\u201d. Ellram et al. (2004) argue that people are the key\nasset in service supply chains and hence the production of the service relies on\nmanaging the skills and capacity of people in the supply chain. However, services\nalso require equipment and facilities which need to be managed in order to\nproduce the service (Haynes and Thies, 1991). In merging these two concepts, it\nis assumed that both products and services have to be produced by managing,\npeople, equipment, facilities and, in the case of products, inventory.\n6. Order Delivery Management is the result of combining three processes: the\nOrder Fulfilment process, the Customer Service Management process from the\nGSCF model (Croxton et al. 2001) and the Service Delivery Management process\nfrom Ellram et al\u2019s (2004) service supply chain model. The Order Fulfilment\nprocess has been defined by Croxton (2003) as \u201call the activities necessary to\ndefine customer requirements, design a network, and enable the firm to meet\ncustomer request while minimizing the total delivered cost\u201d. This process\noverlaps with the Customer Service Management process which has been defined\nas the process that \u201cprovides the firm\u2019s face to the customer, a single source of\ncustomer information, and the key point of contact for administering the\nproduct\/service agreements\u201d (Bolumole et al. 2003). Ellram et al. (2004),\nconversely, define Service Delivery Management as \u201cmaking promises to the\ncustomer, enabling service providers (internal or external) to meet those promises\nand meeting the promises\u201d. Although there are differences in the scope of these\nthree definitions, all include activities to define a customer order, create a network\nto deliver the order and enable the network to deliver the order. For the\nservitization model, this set of activities has been termed the Order Delivery\nProcess, which includes the delivery of both products and services.\n7. Financial Flow Management: as a process comprises the activities required to\nfacilitate the flow of funds across the supply chain, including invoicing customers,\npaying suppliers and any transfers between divisions of the firms involved. This\nprocess is termed Cash Flow Management in Ellram et al\u2019s (2004) service model,\nhowever, it was decided to change the terminology to avoid confusion with the\nfinancial definition of cash flow management. This process does not have an\nequivalent in the GSCF model (Croxton et al. 2001), however, it has been\nrecognised by researchers (Burt et al, 2003; Farris and Hutchison, 2002) that\nfinancial flows are a central element of product supply chains.\n8. Returns Management and End-of-life. The GSCF model (Croxton et al. 2001)\ndefines Returns Management as \u201call activities related to returns, reverse logistics,\ngatekeeping and avoidance\u201d (Rogers et al. 2002). This process has no equivalent\nin Ellram et al\u2019s (2004) service model, however, the management of returns and\nend-of-life is a service provided by the manufacturer or other firms in the network.\nFor the servitized model it was decided to expand the concept to include the range\nof options at the end of the life of a product such as recycling, remanufacturing \/\nrefurbishing and decommissioning.\n9. Product Development Management refers to the activities \u201cinvolved in\nproviding a structure for developing and bringing to market products jointly with\ncustomers and suppliers\u201d (Rogers et al. 2004). Ellram et al\u2019s (2004) service\nsupply chain model does not consider a service development process, however,\nservices also have do be designed and developed (Shostack, 1982). Hence, for the\nservitization model it was decided to adapt Roger\u2019s et al. (2004) definition to\ninclude both products and services. Hence, the Product Development\nManagement process has been defined as the series of activities involved in\nproviding a structure for co-developing products and services with customers and\nsuppliers, and bringing them to market.\n10. Risk Management is the only process in the servitization model that has no\nequivalent in either the GSCF model or the service model. With the servitizing of\nproduct, much of the risk for non-performance transfers to the product provider as\nthe product user is paying an ongoing fee for the availability or capability of a\nproduct or service. This means that the risks of not delivering the product\/service\npromised, even if exogenous to the firm promising the result, need to be\ncontrolled and mitigated (Tukker and van den Berg, 2006). Thus: risks within the\nfirm and supply chain need to be controlled and mitigated. This process has been\nrecently recognised as a legitimate process of supply chain management\n(Christopher, 2003; Tang, 2006) and one that has particular relevance in a\nservitization context because servitized products are often complex and have long\nlife-cycles, both factors contributing to a higher risk exposure. The Risk\nManagement process has been defined as: \u201cthe collaborative activities which seek\nto ensure \u2018profitability and continuity\u2019 through supply chain wide risk reduction\nvia identification and management\u201d (Christopher, 2003; J\u00fcttner et al. 2003; Tang,\n2006).\nThe model emerging from the synthesis of the GSCF model (Croxton et al. 2001) and\nEllram et al\u2019s (2004) service supply chain model comprises a range of processes that\nare capable of dealing with both the product and service aspects of the supply chain of\na servitized product. Figure 2 presents a depiction of the servitized model, which will\nbe used in Section 4 to frame the case studies.\nINSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE\n3 Methodology\nDue to the exploratory nature of the project we used case study research to allow\ngreater flexibility to adapt to the circumstances and terminology used in different\nindustries (Yin, 2003). Five firms involved in servitization were selected for the study\nto allow the findings to be contrasted and replicated (Eisenhardt, 1989) and to\nimprove external validity and observer bias (Voss et al. 2002). Table 2 shows the\ncase summaries including company background, product management focus and\nstages of product use.\nTAKE IN TABLE 2 HERE\nThe business units within the case companies studied all had customers, in some cases\nthese were external customers and in other cases internal customers. For example, at\nNuCo the business unit studied provided and managed servitized products to internal\ncustomers, while at AerCo the business unit provided and managed servitized\nproducts to external customers. Five cases are within the accepted range of studies\nfor the exploratory analysis of a new phenomenon (Eisenhardt, 1989; Meredith,\n1998).\nThe framework developed was used as a lens for analysis by synthesising the\nframework into a semi-structured interview protocol. This ensured that all areas of\nenquiry were covered (Patten, 2002) and allowed clarification of questions that were\nuncertain to respondents (Schober and Conrad, 1997). The interviews were\nconducted over a period of two months. Additional methods of data collection were\nused to triangulate the data obtained from the interviews, including a review of\ncompany documentation, publicly available information and site visits. Case study\nreports were prepared and sent to the companies to validate the data and maintain\nparticipant engagement in the research process.\n4 Case summaries\n4.1 Information flow management\nAll of the case companies stressed the importance of information systems in\nfacilitating their service delivery. In three of the five cases the assets were connected\nto the organisation (e.g. through telematics) which allows the provider to be both\nreactive and proactive towards the upkeep of the asset. With servitized products\nAerCo use real-time data provided by telemetry fitted to the asset to monitor the\nsystem in-use. AerCo can predict with approximately 95% accuracy, to a 2 year time\nhorizon, the point at which it will require repair or overhaul. This allows scheduling\nof a slot in its Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MR&O) facility in addition to\ngenerating an order within AerCo\u2019s ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to\ndeliver parts on a JIT basis using Supply Chain Event Management (SCEM)\ntechniques. SCEM in this context is defined as \u201csystems that monitor events within\nthe supply chain and react according to predefined rules\u201d (Bodendorf and\nZimmerman, 2005). AerCo also use the information flows from the system to\nmonitor usage patterns. This data informs the customer-facing business units of the\norganisation \u2013 to determine whether the charges levied on the contracts are correct \u2013\nand the engineering unit \u2013 to improve future versions of the products. TransCo also\nuse telematics to remotely monitor products and as with AerCo use this data to trigger\norders within their ERP system. They also use Product Lifecycle Management\nsoftware to manage the design, manufacture and support of their systems and\nproducts. At NuCo all critical processes are monitored in real-time allowing increased\nvisibility of potential risks and facilitating the predictive maintenance of safety critical\nitems. In NuCo\u2019s case as the asset base is fixed, telemetry is not used, NuCo also\napply SCEM techniques for the ordering of inventory for maintenance operations.\nThe remaining two case companies also used IT to facilitate service delivery but this\nwas not performed automatically. With FleetCo a proprietary IT system holds all\nvehicle-related data and is used to compare each vehicle to industry standards with\nexception reports generated, and customers contacted, if there is variation. Fleet\nmanagers that use FleetCo\u2019s services gain access to an online portal which allows\nthem to obtain quotes for, and order, new vehicles and facilitates the analysis and\noptimisation of the usage of the vehicle fleet. Fleetco\u2019s portal also allows fleet\nvehicle drivers to determine whether the vehicle they are driving requires\nmaintenance or taxing. CraneCo use a central IT system to schedule maintenance\nwhich is updated manually and used to schedule servicing and the ordering of parts\nfor maintenance.\n4.2 Customer relationship management\nIn two of the cases (AerCo, TransCo) relationships with customers were formalised\nand incentivised through contractual agreements that were related to the performance\nof the system supplied. For AerCo servitized systems provided through availability\ntype contracts cover approximately 30% of the installed base. At the highest level of\napplication the customer contracts for availability without buying a system: AerCo\ncover the costs of acquisition, maintenance and modification over a fixed period of\ntime, typically 20 years. The customer pays a fee based on their usage of the system.\nUsing this type of contract AerCo increase revenues over the course of the life of the\nproduct, stabilise cash flow (due to regular payments) allowing more regular\ninvestment in R&D. AerCo also gain a greater insight into the customer\u2019s practices\nand how their product performs in-use whilst maintaining customer lock-in-\npreventing the disintegration of lucrative profits in the aftermarket by third parties. A\nfurther service that is incorporated into availability contracts is access to AerCo\u2019s\nproprietary online portal that allows customers to access technical documents; view\nand manage asset repair and overhaul progress; and receive notice of technical\ndocuments. TransCo also supplies a variety of solutions, from individual vehicles to\ncomplete transportation systems in conjunction with the provision of a range of\nsystem management services. Contracts with clients are based on specification or\nperformance of the system or vehicle with contract type influencing the involvement\nof TransCo over the lifecycle. Involvement ranges from very basic responsibilities, to\nthe servitization of the system. This option is selected by organisations that wish to\nfocus on delivering the core service to customers with TransCo focussing upon the\nsupport of the network.\nIn a further case, relationships with customers were provided by a single point of\ncontact for each customer. The decommissioning and waste storage parts of NuCo do\nnot have customers in the traditional sense and instead have stakeholders that\nrepresent a wide range of interests. These range from members of the public to non-\ngovernmental agencies to international agencies. Each of the stakeholders is managed\nby a single point of contact within NuCo with regular internal communication\nbetween the contacts ensuring that there is a comprehensive overview of the\nrequirements of the stakeholders.\n4.3 Supplier relationship management\nIn two \u2013 AerCo and TransCo - of the cases there was evidence of long-term\nrelationships with suppliers and a heavy reliance on their supply base for competences\nother than simple manufacture. AerCo have, in recent years, sought to consolidate\ntheir supply base and transition their suppliers away from the delivery of discrete\nparts to the delivery of systems, sub-systems and modules. This has meant that design\nresponsibility has transferred from AerCo to the supplier, with these new suppliers\nbeing classed as \u201cintegrators\u201d. AerCo have classed these organisations into a\nclassification that ranks the integrators competence. This ranges from \u201csystems\nintegrators\u201d that are capable of designing and delivering complex systems to\n\u201cpackaging integrators\u201d that are able to integrate components into a complete kit that\nwill be sold as a spares package. As integrators are responsible for more than the\nmanufacture of a product they are rewarded appropriately. Systems integrators are\ncontracted under a long-term risk\/reward arrangement where the integrator will pay\nAerCo a sum to become a partner with this outlay being offset by ongoing fees paid\nthrough the life of the product and availability contracts. TransCo do not have the full\nsuite of capabilities required to manufacture locomotives and as with AerCo use their\nsuppliers as integrators, relying on their supply chain to provide systems such as\ndiesel and electric motors and bogies with TransCo acting as a systems integrator.\nSuppliers of systems to TransCo do so under long-term collaborative contracts.\nIn a further case (CraneCo) we saw further evidence that organisations were building\nlonger term relationships with suppliers although this was for slightly different\nreasons. Embedded knowledge and training of staff on equipment is leading CraneCo\ntowards looking more favourably upon equipment from vendors with which they have\nexperience. There was also supplier incentivisation with CraneCo although this was\nimplicit rather than stated within a contract. For CraneCo the possibility of a supplier\nperforming poorly and being the subject of bad press in a niche industry with are\ncompetitors for substantial contracts leads to vendors honouring the terms of the\ncontract.\nIn one of the cases (NuCo) where the company studied used, as opposed to provided,\nservitized assets multiple contract types were used to deal with suppliers. This is\nsimilar to the findings in sub-section 4.2 of this analysis. NuCo use multiple modes\nof contracting when acquiring products, ranging from simple acquisition to using\nservitized products. Products that are servitized tend to be of a more standardised\nnature where the risk to safety of failure is minimal. The reasons given for the use of\nservitized assets was to \u201cimprove cash flow\u201d due to the lack of a large payment to\nacquire the asset.\n4.4 Demand management\nIn two of the cases (AerCo, NuCo) the demand was managed centrally using\ninformation gathered from decentralised units and remotely from the assets in the\nfield. Demand management at AerCo is performed by a quarterly review of the\norders for new assets and the forecast of demand for aftermarket parts. This review is\nperformed centrally to the business although information is gathered from around the\nbusiness, including overseas bases and real-time data that has been analysed for issues\nthat will have an impact upon the demand placed upon the supply chain. This is due\nto AerCo operating in a make-to-order (MTO) environment for production parts \u2013\nwith a 3-5 year lead-time for customers - and a make-to-stock (MTS) environment for\naftermarket \u2013 where the requirement for a replacement part or system may be\ninstantaneous if the aircraft has suffered unexpected damage. This quarterly review\nof demand is then placed upon the supply chain through an explicit process that\nensures that orders can be met fully within lead-time. NuCo have a central\ndepartment managing the support of the site which is updated regularly depending on\nthe condition of assets within the facility. This department has a strategy spanning to\nthe expected end-of-life of the facilities (70+ years). Long-term goals, including all\nplanned work and the forecasts for related material requirements, are captured and\nheld centrally with the plans further stratified to shorter-term objectives and plans.\n4.5 Production management\nInternal process management varied between each of the five case companies. We\nsuggest that this is to be expected given the differing industrial contexts.\nAt NuCo safety-critical systems are triplicated and all critical processes monitored in\nreal-time to allow increased visibility of process performance. This facilitates\npredictive maintenance of safety critical items where possible with non-critical\nsystems maintained using preventive and failure-driven maintenance philosophies.\nThe extreme specialisation of the industry has also led NuCo to forecast demand and\npurchase and manage their own spare parts using SCEM techniques. This has\nallowed the company to centralise the maintenance inventory to be more responsive to\nmaintenance requirements.\nInternal process flow within AerCo is facilitated by an ERP system that, despite the\nreal-time information flow available from the telemetry on the assets, is run on a\nweekly basis due to the volume of data within the system. AerCo has very few\ndedicated manufacturing flowlines, with the majority of manufacturing processes\nbeing arranged into jobshops capable of multiple process routes. When the product is\nno longer in serial production, and parts are supplied to aftermarket demands only,\nAerCo transitions the supply chain to a stand-alone business unit that is better\nequipped to deal with the supply and demand volatilities that occur.\nWith FleetCo the vehicles are acquired based on a customer specification, the vehicles\nare then handed over to the customer who will be responsible for planning the\nmaintenance of the vehicle \u2013 using the online portal - and making sure it is \u201cfit for\npurpose\u201d. Maintenance, both routine (services) and reactive (breakdowns or\naccidents), is outsourced to a network of garages available in every country where\nthey operate. Whenever a customer takes a vehicle for service, the garage collects\nand sends relevant data to FleetCo to check the status of the vehicle against industry\nstandards.\nAt CraneCo maintenance for both types of product is outsourced with the lease\nagreement for the forklift trucks also incorporating a small level of maintenance work.\nWhen CraneCo acquire equipment they acquire not only the hardware but training,\nspares packages and technical documentation. Spare parts for major products are\nmanaged on CraneCo\u2019s site by a 3rd party maintenance provider. They are property\nof the vendor until three years after the acquisition of the equipment, after which\nCraneCo can decide whether they wish to purchase the spares which are typically the\nfull parts package required. This may be advantageous as the spares package\nprovided by the vendor may not be suitable for CraneCo - it may be too large, tying\nup cash; or too small; giving sub-optimal levels of spares. If spares are used within\nthe initial three year agreement CraneCo pays the vendor the cost of the part with no\nmark-up.\n4.6 Order fulfilment\nAerCo and TransCo used a number of techniques to decentralise their order\nfulfilment. At AerCo the order fulfilment \u2013 for physical items and services \u2013 for\nservitized assets is provided through a number of mechanisms. This includes the use\nof inventory pooled between airlines and held at major airports to provide rapid\nresponse to unexpected failures, an approach also used by another case company.\nTransCo undertake Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul to the standards agreed in the\ncontract and whilst that asset is overhauled a further asset from a pool replaces that\nbeing serviced. A further mechanism used for order fulfilment by AerCo is the\nestablishment of overseas MR&O facilities under joint (JV) agreements. The\nestablishment of the JV\u2019s was performed with organisations that contracted for\navailability and allows AerCo to reduce the capital invested in service facilities\nthrough the partnering arrangement. The arrangement also increases access to further\nmarkets as the asset users need not return the assets to AerCo\u2019s European\nheadquarters and has benefits for the asset user as it allows the partner \u2013 an asset user\nitself \u2013 to have full visibility of service costs.\n4.7 Financial flow management\nAll five of the case companies studied provided or used systems or assets under lease\nagreements where an ongoing fee was paid, and in some instances the companies\nprovided an \u2018extended offering\u2019 that included a range of services. In most cases this\nwas dependent upon usage with only CraneCo paying a flat lease rate. AerCo\nprovided systems and assets under availability contracts where the users pay an\nongoing lease fee. They are contractually bound to meet performance measures for\nservice responsiveness or they pay a financial penalty. TransCo also provide systems\nand products under performance-based capability contracts where penalties are levied\nby the asset user for poor performance. FleetCo provide vehicles under lease\nagreements with the vehicle lease being augmented by a range of services such as\nfuels cards and insurance; NuCo lease standardised assets which include some\nsupport; and CraneCo lease forklifts with the lease agreement incorporating\nmaintenance.\n4.8 Returns and end-of-life\nAll of the case companies dealt with the end of an assets life in similar ways with only\none organisation having formal methods for dealing with an asset at the end-of-life.\nAerCo do not have an explicit process for dealing with assets at the end of their\nworking life. At the end of the lease agreement the assets are returned to AerCo\nwhere, due to the long working life of the systems, very few are disposed of in the\ntraditional sense. There is an active market for used systems which will typically go\ninto use on freight aircraft or shorter airline routes with regional airlines. Further\noptions include the cannibalisation of the system by AerCo or other organisations to\nprovide further spares for the installed base or the remanufacture of the system for use\nby further users. Whilst TransCo do not have an explicit policy for the end of a\nsystem or vehicles life, they have a policy of upgrading all vehicles at the mid-point\n(typically 15 years). CraneCo do have a strategy for the disposal of products from\ntheir business; this is either by scrapping the equipment or selling \u201cas seen\u201d to another\nparty.\nFleetCo collect and inspect vehicles at the end of the lease period. Digital pictures of\nthe vehicles are taken and posted on a website so that customers can access and verify\nall the information. In some cases the customer decides to buy the vehicle at the end\nof the lease period. If this is not the case, the vehicle is disposed of through a variety\nof channels including auctions (both traditional and online), retailers and traders.\nWith NuCo there are no defined end-of-life options and NuCo are in the process of\ndefining the end-of-life of the assets through the decommissioning work that they are\nperforming.\n4.9 Product development\nAt AerCo and TransCo a whole-life view was taken during product development with\nsystems integrators also contributing to the development of the systems and assets.\nAerCo use a suite of tools during the design stage which forces them to focus on the\nlifecycle of the product, they also involve organisations in the design of the product\nwith systems integrators taking responsibility for some design activities. At TransCo\nsupport issues that occur through life are covered through the involvement of a\nmaintenance team and members of the supply chain in the product design process\nfrom conception with maintenance targets included as part of the system specification.\nVehicles are designed using a modular architecture for ease of manufacture and\nassembly. This design also has benefits for the maintenance and support of the\nsystem, facilitating the removal of components and the installation of updates and\nupgrades.\n4.10 Risk management\nWhen an organisation contracts for availability \u2013 by leasing servitized assets \u2013 they\nreduce operational risk caused by delays in service. In two of the cases (AerCo,\nTransCo) we witnessed explicit strategies for mitigating the risk on the focal firm.\nAerCo reduce their exposure to risk by transferring some of the disincentives for non-\nconformance to the supply chain and by partnering with other organisations at\noverseas MR&O facilities. Moreover, through the use of a servitized system the user\nfocuses on the delivery of its core offering, in this case flights, and transfers risk to\nAerCo as support of the system is now in the realm of the system provider not user.\nCraneCo\u2019s use of a third party for maintenance was a business decision taken to\nmitigate the possible impacts upon CraneCo by industrial action by unions.\n5 Summary and Conclusions\nA servitization strategy requires the coordination of complex networks of product and\nservice providers. To understand the challenges involved in using this strategy it is\nimportant to have a framework that identifies the key processes involved. The\nliterature review revealed the absence of supply chain frameworks for managing a\ncombination of both products and services. This gap was addressed by combining\ntwo frameworks, one aimed at product supply chains and one at service supply chains.\nThe result of this synthesis was a new model for supply chains for servitized products.\nThe model was then used for analysing the cases studies, testing its applicability and\nhelping to identify patterns across the cases. Its application revealed that all ten\nprocesses were applicable to all the cases to a greater or lesser degree.\nIn the analysis of the cases it became evident that some of the processes were\nparticularly important in the use of a servitization strategy. Information Flow\nManagement stood out as a key process, by linking other processes using real-time\ndata from the product, collected through condition monitoring and telemetry\nequipment. This data can be used to remotely place orders in the supply chain, both\nfor spares and other maintenance services and is a key input for processes such as\nDemand Management, Production Management and Order Delivery Management,\nallowing grater responsiveness in all these processes. Additionally, information flow\nwill also affect Customer Relationship Management and Supplier Relationship\nManagement, by allowing the most efficient and effective flow of information\nbetween supply chain partners. Hence, an important challenge for managers in this\ntype of supply chain is the establishment of supply systems that can respond to real-\ntime information by effectively deploying resources, including people, equipment and\nspares.\nAnother process that appeared particularly important in a servitization context was\nRisk Management. It was found that supply chains for servitized products make the\nnetwork the bearer of risks. This is due to capability contracts containing penalties\nfor non-conformance with the risk often mitigated by the product supplier to the\nproviders of sub-systems and components within the network. This implies that when\norganisations are establishing a strategy of servitization, long-term agreements should\nalso be established with strategic suppliers. This has a direct impact on both\nCustomer Relationship Management and Supplier Relationship Management\nprocesses.\nA further finding of this research is that the characteristics of supply chains for\nservitized products is different to that of \u2018traditional\u2019 supply chains for physical\nproducts, whether the demand is from production or from the aftermarket. The\nstrategy of production supply chains is typically to deliver products efficiently while\nthat of aftermarket supply chains is to be responsive as products can only fulfil\noperational goals when functioning. Thus: spares need to be available for\nmaintenance or repair. The research indicates that supply chains for servitized\nproducts needs to focus on the delivery of \u2018value\u20191 to the user of the product. This\nindicates that servitized supply chains deliver a range of options, from products such\nas spare parts and modules to services such as maintenance. This is an evolution of\nthe supply chain away from the delivery of the physical towards the co-ordination and\ndelivery of the physical (e.g. spare) and the non-physical (maintenance fitter). Table\n3 summarises the difference between production, aftermarket and servitized supply\nchains.\nTAKE IN TABLE 3 HERE\nIt is recognized that the research has its limitations. Firstly, the case method has\nlimitations in terms of generalisability; hence, future research using alternative\napproaches that allow a larger and more diverse population, such as survey research,\nwould improve reliability. A further limitation is that the research focused on the\npractices within the supply chain of servitized products, not on the rationale behind its\nuse or the conditions for its effectiveness. Future research focusing into these aspects\nof servitization would allow the identification of critical success factors and the\ndevelopment of guidelines for the effective deployment of this strategy. These further\ninvestigations could also examine the impacts of different organisational cultures,\ninformation protocols and further barriers to the flow of information across the\nnetwork.\nFurther empirical testing of the model is recommended through alternative methods to\nstrengthen its generalisability. Future research into supply chains for servitized\nproducts could also consider the changes in supply chain configuration over the\nlifecycle of the product. This is due to the value required by the customer, and hence\nthe proposition delivered by the supply chain whether product or service, being in flux\nover the lifecycle of the product.\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to thank Atos Origin for providing funding for the research and the\nparticipants in the case research.
