Introduction \n \nAn ability to predict the radionuclide activity concentrations in biota is an essential \ncomponent of any approach assessing exposure of non-human biota (Higley et al. 2003a; \nBeresford et al. 2004).  \nIn an overview of the availability of transfer parameters for wild terrestrial plants and \nanimals, we previously highlighted that transparency in the method of estimating transfer \nparameters and the data provenance were sometimes lacking (Beresford et al. 2004). Whilst \nthe overall methodology used to derive the default transfer parameters within the ERICA-\nTool is explained in associated documentation (see Beresford et al. (2007a) and ERICA-\nTool help file), the provenance of all default values is not given. This paper describes the \ngeneral methodology applied to derive the transfer parameters that are available within the \nERICA-Tool (Brown et al. this issue).  The paper concentrates on the terrestrial ecosystem, \npresenting the default transfer parameter values for terrestrial biota in more detail than can \nbe found within previous documents; a second paper presents default values for marine and \nfreshwater ecosystems (Hosseini et al. this issue). For descriptions of the ERICA Integrated \nApproach and the ERICA-Tool the reader should consult Beresford et al. (2007a), Larsson \n(this issue) and Brown et al. (this issue). \n \n1.1. Definition and requirements of transfer parameters  within the ERICA Integrated \nApproach \n \nWhole-body activity concentrations of radionuclides in terrestrial biota within the \nERICA-Tool are predicted from media activity concentrations using equilibrium \nconcentration ratios (CRs), where: \n \n)dry weight kg (Bq soilin ion concentratActivity \nht)fresh weig kg (Bqbody - wholebiotain ion concentratActivity \n  CR\n1-\n-1\n \nwith the exception of chronic atmospheric releases of \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n32,33\nP and \n35\nS where: \n)m (Bqair in ion concentratActivity \nht)fresh weig kg (Bqbody - wholebiotain ion concentratActivity \n  CR\n3-\n-1\n \n \nThe ERICA-Tool considers 13 terrestrial reference organisms\n1\n and the radioisotopes \nof 31 elements (see e.g. Table 3). The ERICA-Tool requires CR values for two purposes: \n(i) to derive environmental media concentration limits (ECMLs) for use within an initial \nscreening tier (termed Tier 1 within the ERICA Integrated Approach); (ii) to provide a \ndefault CR dataset to enable the user to estimate whole-body activity concentrations, and \nhence dose rates, during more detailed assessments (Tiers 2 and 3 within the ERICA \nIntegrated Approach). An environmental media concentration limit is defined as the activity \n                                                 \n1\nNote that whilst the ERICA-Tool has two terrestrial mammal reference organisms, Mammal (Rat) and \nMammal (Deer), the same CR values are used for both. The distinction was introduced to enable the \napplication of geometries proposed by the ICRP (2005) within dosimetric calculations. \n 4 \nconcentration in the selected media (soil or air in terrestrial environments, water or \nsediment in aquatic environments) that would result in a dose-rate to the most exposed \nreference organism equal to the screening dose-rate (see Brown et al. this issue). To \ncalculate the EMCL values used in Tier 1 a complete set of CR values was required (i.e. a \ntotal of 403 CR values for terrestrial biota). As the EMCL values are determined using a \nMonte Carlo approach, the specification of probability distribution functions, and where \npossible, standard deviations for the CRs values were also required. The probability \ndistribution functions and standard deviations also provide the default values to enable \nprobabilistic assessments using Tier 3 of the ERICA-Tool. Further details of the derivation \nof the ERICA-Tool EMCL values and the tiered assessment approach adopted within the \nERICA Integrated Approach are given in Beresford et al. (2007a), Larsson (this issue) and \nBrown et al. (this issue). \n \n2. Approaches \n \n2.1 Literature review and data manipulation \n \nThe existing CR databases of the FASSET (Brown et al. 2003a) and EPIC (Brown et \nal. 2003b; Beresford et al. 2005) projects provided the starting point for our literature \nreview. These databases have been supplemented and extended to encompass the greater \nnumber of radionuclides and modified suite of reference organisms considered within the \nERICA integrated approach. Efforts were targeted at improving CR values for which the \nFASSET\/EPIC databases had relatively few values and providing values for the additional \nreference organism-radionuclide combinations. Little effort was put into finding additional \ndata for reference organism-radionuclide combinations when the FASSET\/EPIC values \nwere already based on many (>100) data (namely Cs and Sr data for some of those \nreference organisms considered in all three projects). For compilation of the ERICA \ndatabases, and implementation within the ERICA-Tool, different radioisotopes of a given \nelement were all assumed to have the same CR value. \nIn preference, original references were consulted rather than adopting values \nrecommended in reviews; where original references were not available and review values \nwere used, this is noted with the ERICA-Tool databases (see section 2.2).  \nData were often not available in the format required. Issues which had to be addressed \nwere: (i) reporting of biota activity concentrations on a dry or ash weight basis; (ii) data \navailable only for specific tissues (i.e. not whole-body); and, (iii) soil activity \nconcentrations being presented as Bq m\n-2\n.  \nWhere information was not given within the source publications, to enable \nmanipulation of the data into the format required for the ERICA default databases a set of \nstandard assumptions were followed. Tables 1 and 2, respectively, present: conversion \nfactors for data presented on an ash or dry weight basis to fresh weight; assumed \npercentages of total animal live-weight of required tissues and; distribution of radionuclides \nwithin different tissues for terrestrial systems. Corresponding information for aquatic \nsystems is presented in Hosseini et al. (this issue). If source publications lacked the required \ninformation to convert soil activities from Bq m\n-2\n to Bq kg\n-1\n, a dry weight soil bulk density \nof 1400 kg m\n-3\n and a sampling depth of 10 cm were assumed. All assumptions and \n 5 \nmanipulations applying to a given data entry are recorded in the underlying databases but \nnot in the summarised databases presented within the ERICA-Tool. \nFor terrestrial ecosystems, data collected during either the period of above ground \nnuclear weapons testing fallout (assumed to be before 1970) or the year of the Chernobyl \naccident (1986) were not used to derive transfer parameter values for radionuclides of Cs, \nPu, Sr and Am to avoid effects of surface contamination of vegetation. Some CR values \nwere derived using stable element data; in terrestrial ecosystems these data were often \nassociated with studies of heavy metal pollution and only data from control \n(\u2018uncontaminated\u2019) sites were used.  \nWith the exception of data for reindeer, data for any species falling within a given \nreference organism category were used in the review. Reindeer data were excluded as the \nair-lichen-reindeer pathway is unlikely to be representative of contamination routes for \nother terrestrial mammals and is likely to result in over predictions for the mammal \nreference organism category. The FASSET database (Brown et al. 2003a) did contain data \nfor reindeer. For instance, the FASSET \n210\nPo CR value for herbivorous mammals was \nbased solely on reindeer data. FASSET predictions of \n210\nPo activity concentrations in \nmammals were two to four orders of magnitude higher than those of other approaches in an \ninternational comparison exercise (see Beresford et al. submitted). Hence, alternative data \nwere identified for \n210\nPo on which mammal CR values could be estimated for the ERICA \ndefault value. For consistency, reindeer data were excluded from the review of all \nradionuclides.  \nWhere possible weighted (with respect to sample numbers and reported standard \ndeviations) arithmetic mean CR values and standard deviations were estimated. Lack of \ninformation in some source publications again resulted in some assumptions and \ncompromises having to be made to achieve this. These were: (i) a sample number of one \nwas assumed if information on replication was not given and no error term was reported; \n(ii) if a measure of error (e.g. standard deviation or standard error) was reported without a \nsample number it was assumed that the sample number was three; and, (iii) if a measure of \nerror was reported for either only media or biota activity concentrations this was carried \nthrough (proportionally) to give a standard deviation estimate on the calculated CR values; \n(iv) a sample number of two was assumed if a minimum and maximum were reported with \nno details of sample replication. However, for reference organism-radionuclide \ncombinations for which there were many reported values, references which did not give all \nthe required information were rejected.  \nThe resultant default CR values and associated standard deviations are presented in \nTables 3-15; source references are identified in Table 16. As noted above, probability \ndistribution functions are used within the ERICA-Tool and the derivation of EMCL values. \nWhen standard deviations were available for default CR values, lognormal distribution \nfunctions were assumed. If no standard deviation was available then an exponential \nprobability distribution function was assumed (for justification see Brown et al. this issue).  \n \n2.2 Approach taken to providing default values if CR values not identified by literature \nreview \n \nOf the 403 CR values required for terrestrial reference organisms, 129 were identified \n 6 \nby the literature review. It was not possible to derive a complete set of literature derived CR \nvalues for any radionuclide or any reference organism.  To provide the remaining required \ndefault CR values an approach was developed based upon that originally described by \nCopplestone et al. (2003) and later adapted by Brown et al. (2003a). The approach, \ndescribed below, was the same for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (see Hosseini et al. \n(this issue) for application within the marine and freshwater ecosystems). The first four \noptions described below were used in preference. With the exception of the last two options \ndescribed, which were used as last resorts, the remaining options were applied depending \nupon availability of information (i.e. none were favoured more than others). Tables 3-15 \npresent the complete default CR database as included in the ERICA-Tool for terrestrial \nreference organisms (as of July 2007). The approach used to derive each default value is \nidentified in each table (and is evident to the user within the ERICA-Tool).  The options \nused to provide default CR values, when values could not be derived from the literature, \nwere: \n1. Use an available CR value for an organism of similar taxonomy within that ecosystem \nfor the radionuclide under assessment (preferred option). An example of application to \nderive default values in the ERICA terrestrial database was assuming values for (e.g.) \nflying insects were applicable to other terrestrial invertebrate reference organisms (see \nTables 7,8 and 14 for examples). Note where there was more than one available value for \nvarious taxonomically similar reference organisms, then the highest available CR was \ngenerally used to provide missing values. \n2. Use an available CR value for a similar reference organism (preferred option).  \nExamples of use to derive default values in the ERICA databases were applying available \nCR values for one vertebrate reference organism to other vertebrate reference organisms. \nAs above where, there was more than one available value for various similar reference \norganism then the highest available CR was generally used to provide missing values (e.g. \nthe literature derived Th CR value for birds (Table 4) was higher than that for mammals \n(Table 11) and hence the bird value was assumed in the default database for amphibians \nand reptiles (Tables 3 and 12) as data were not available for these two reference \norganisms). \n3. Use CR values recommended in previous reviews or derive them from previously \npublished reviews (preferred option). For instance, in some cases, it was necessary to use \nbroad reviews of stable element concentrations in media and biota to derive CR values or \nadopt previously recommended values without being able to go back to the source \nreference to confirm these (examples are clearly illustrated in Tables 3-7 and 9-15). \n4. Use specific activity models for \n3\nH and \n14\nC (preferred option). No attempt was made to \nderive CR values for these two radionuclides from the literature. To derive CR values for  \n3\nH and \n14\nC to FASSET and EPIC reference organisms specific activity models (described \nby Galeriu et al. (2005) and Brown et al. (2003a,b)) were developed. These were used to \nprovide the default CR values for \n3\nH and \n14\nC within the ERICA-Tool where available. If \nCR values were not available for specific reference organisms one of the above three \napproaches was used (e.g. the \n14\nC CR value from FASSET for mammals (Table 11) was \nused to provide the default ERICA value for amphibians (Table 3)). \n 7 \n5. Use an available CR value for the given reference organism for an element of similar \nbiogeochemistry. To derive default values in the ERICA database for terrestrial biota this \noption involved the following: available CRs for transuranic and lanthanide elements were \nassumed if CRs were not available for a member of these series; Zr CRs assumed for Nb; \nSe CRs assumed for Te. Again where there was more than one available CR value for \nbiogeochemical similar elements for the reference organism in question then the highest \navailable value was generally assumed.  \n6. Use an available CR value for biogeochemically similar elements for organisms of \nsimilar taxonomy. Examples of this option were: Th and Zr CR values for terrestrial \ninvertebrates were assumed to be the same as those available for available U and Nb \nrespectively (Tables 7, 8 and 14).  \n7. Use an available CR value for biogeochemically similar elements available for a similar \nreference organism. This option was used to derive some missing actinide CRs for \nterrestrial vertebrates (e.g. the Am CR for mammals was used to provide the default Cm \nCR for amphibians, birds and reptiles (Tables 3, 4 and 12)).  \n8. Use allometric relationships, or other modelling approaches, to derive appropriate CRs \nExamples of application to derive default values in the ERICA databases are: (i) the use of \nallometric (body weight dependent, see Higley et al. (2003b)) relationships to predict CRs \nfor terrestrial mammals (Table 11); (ii) CRs for wild bird eggs were derived from the \navailable CRs for wild birds and published relationships between radionuclide activity \nconcentrations in eggs and meat of domestic poultry (taken from IAEA 1994) (Table 5). \n9. Assume the highest available CR (least preferred option). For the terrestrial database this \noption was only used to provide Po and Tc CR values for invertebrate reference organisms \n(Tables 7, 8 and 14) and the Tc CR value for the lichen and bryophytes reference organism \n(Table 10). \nIn Tables 3-15, and the ERICA-Tool database, a CR value derived by one of the \nabove approaches is coded by the number of the option used from the above description. \nFor CR values derived by these approaches exponential probability distribution functions \nwere generally assumed (see Brown et al. this issue). \nIn some instances, it was necessary to use combinations of the above approaches (e.g. \nthe Zr CR value for amphibians was assumed to be the same as that for mammals which in \nitself was derived from a whole-body:diet concentration ratio (Table 11)). All CR values \nfor P in terrestrial ecosystems fall into this category as it was assumed, due to the lack of \navailable data, that the C CR values, derived from specific activity models, could be used \nfor P (following the suggestion of Copplestone et al. (2003) that this should provide \nconservative CR values for P). This approach of combining rules is given the code number \n11 within Tables 3-15 (note code number 10 denotes an option used in aquatic ecosystems \nonly (Hosseini et al. this issue)). \nOn a few occasions the approaches outlined above were used in preference to values \nderived from the literature review for reasons of judgements made with regard to data \nquality\/quantity. For instance, the default Pu CR value for birds was assumed to be the \nsame as the value for mammals (based on 123 observations) rather than using the one value \n 8 \nidentified in the literature for birds (Brisbin et al. 1993) as the reference contained four (out \nof a total of six) measurements recorded as \u20180\u2019. \nFor a number of reference organisms, most notably amphibians (Table 3), birds \n(Table 4), bird eggs (Table 5) and reptiles (Table 12), the majority of CR values were \nderived by the approaches outlined above as data were unavailable. \nThe CR values derived by the methods described above are clearly identified within \nthe ERICA-Tool databases and  highlighted on appropriate screens within the Tool (within \nTier 2 and 3 assessments) to prompt the user to review and edit the parameters as \nappropriate (Brown et al. this issue).  \nTables 3-15 present the default terrestrial database as of July 2007 which will be \nupdated periodically as new information becomes available, using the methodology \ndescribed in this paper. \n \n3. Discussion \n \nIt is not our intention to provide a critique of the default CR values provided within \nthe ERICA-Tool, the aim of this paper is to provide a description of the provenance for the \ndefault terrestrial CR dataset used within the ERICA-Tool. However, the ERICA terrestrial \n(and freshwater) CR values have been used in a model-model inter-comparison exercise of \neight models by an IAEA working group (Beresford et al. submitted). The exercise \nincluded 13 elements and was applicable to five of the terrestrial reference organisms \nconsidered within the ERICA-Tool. The main finding of the exercise was that generally \nthere was considerable variation, over orders of magnitude, between the predictions of the \nvarious models. It was concluded that future efforts be concentrated on the transfer \ncomponents of the models as these are the major contributor to predicted variability in \nexposure estimates (see also Vives i Batlle 2007; Beresford et al. in press). Whilst, the \nexercise did not make any judgments with regard to the \u2018correct\u2019 prediction, reference \norganism-radionuclide combinations for which ERICA predicted outlying values compared \nto the other models, will be further investigated and the CR database modified if \nappropriate (the outlying predictions for terrestrial biota were comparatively high \npredictions for I transfer to bird eggs and comparatively low predictions for U transfer to \nherbivorous mammals and Sr to earthworms). Participation in this exercise led to the \nrefinement of terrestrial mammal CR values by identifying that reindeer data needed to be \nexcluded (as discussed above).  \nTowards the end of the development of the ERICA-Tool, a number of case study \nassessments were conducted including three sites for terrestrial environments. These were a \ncoastal sand dune ecosystem close to the Sellafield reprocessing plant (UK), terrestrial \necosystems within the Chernobyl 30 km exclusion zone and areas with high levels of \nnatural radionuclides in the Komi Republic (Russia) (Beresford et al. 2007b; Wood et al. \nthis issue; Beresford et al. this issue). These case studies enabled comparisons of predicted \nand observed activity concentrations for a wide range of biota and radionuclides. In \nsummary, the findings of the case studies with respect to the CR values were: \n Chernobyl (Beresford et al. 2007b; this issue) \u2013 whole-body 137Cs, 90Sr, 241Am and \nPu-isotope activity concentrations were typically predicted to be within one-order of \n 9 \nmagnitude of the observed data. However, for some small mammal data the 95\nth\n \npercentile prediction was lower than the observed data range for \n137\nCs and \n90\nSr.  \n Coastal sand dune ecosystem (Beresford et al. 2007b; Wood et al. this issue) \u2013 137Cs \nactivity concentrations were consistently over predicted although there was \nreasonable agreement for \n241\nAm, \n90\nSr, \n239+240\nPu and \n99\nTc for all animal types. \nActivity concentrations of \n241\nAm were consistently under-predicted probably as a \nconsequence of the main contamination route at this site being sea-land transfer.  \n Komi Republic (Beresford et al. 2007b) \u2013 measured 226Ra activity concentrations \nwere within predicted ranges for grasses, herbs and shrubs. However, \n226\nRa activity \nconcentrations for trees were considerably under predicted. Comparisons of \npredicted and observed activity concentrations of \n232\nTh and \n238\nU in all vegetative \nreference organisms varied between different sites. The few data available for small \nmammals showed reasonable agreement for \n226\nRa but under-prediction of \n238\nU and \n232\nTh. \n \nA few CR values were amended following the case study applications to incorporate \nnovel data collected for the case studies and Tables 3-15 contain these revised values. \nThe organism-radionuclide combinations considered within the coastal sand dune \ncase study included some of the most poorly represented within the ERICA-Tool CR \ndatabase (because of the lack of reported data). Many of the CR values used in this case \nstudy were therefore based upon the approaches described above (see section 2.2) to derive \ndefault values. These include: Am and Pu CR values for birds, amphibians and reptiles; \nmost Tc CR values and; the Cs CR value for reptiles (see Wood et al. this issue). The \nreasonable agreement between predictions and observations for most of these organism-\nradionuclides is therefore encouraging with regard to the approaches taken to provide \ndefault CR values within the ERICA Tool when empirical data were unavailable.  \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nThis paper has described the derivation of the default CR database for the terrestrial \necosystem within the ERICA-Tool presenting the default terrestrial database as available \nJuly 2007. The information provided gives the user of the ERICA-Tool with the ability to \nmake more informed decisions on the use of the default CR database (note all CR values \ncan be edited by the user if they wish). The ERICA-Tool will continue to participate within \ninternational comparison exercises (see http:\/\/www-ns.iaea.org\/projects\/emras\/emras-biota-\nwg.htm and http:\/\/www.ceh.ac.uk\/PROTECT\/) and the CR databases will be updated as \nnew information becomes available.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was supported by the EC-EURATOM 6\nth\n Framework Programme (2002-\n2006) and forms part of the ERICA (Environmental Risk from Ionising Contaminants: \nAssessment and Management) project, contract FI6R-CT-2003-508847.
