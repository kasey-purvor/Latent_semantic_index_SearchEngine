Moreover, research on the arrival time of birds from wintering grounds to breeding \nlocations is an important part of many phenological studies (Sparks 1999; Walther et al. 2002; \nSparks et al. 2003). However, a bias probably exists in studies on bird phenology, strongly \nfocused on very well known species, which may limit our knowledge on the functioning of \necological systems. The same is true of the geographical locations of many studies; the majority \nof which have been conducted in Western Europe or North America (review in: Lehikoinen et al. \n2004). The reported results fit very well with changes in climate during recent decades (Sparks et \nal. 2003; Lehikoinen et al. 2004; Root et al. 2006). Spring arrival dates of birds to their breeding \nplaces have been shown to correlate very well with local temperatures, as well as with \ntemperatures on migratory routes and in wintering grounds (Sparks et al. 2003; Gordo et al. \n2005; Mitrus et al. 2005). However in some parts of the world, temperature has not increased \nsignificantly, or increased only in periods (months) of relatively minor importance to migrating \nbirds. If in such places birds still arrived earlier, how would this affect predictions of climate \nchange influences on bird migration?  \n We tested this question with data from one location in central Euroasia surrounding \nKazan in the Tatarstan Republic (Russia), where observed changes in surface temperature were \nrelatively low (Karolay and Wu 2005) in comparison with other regions where phenological \nshifts have been reported (summary in: Walther et al. 2002; Lehikoinen et al. 2004). As the study \nsubject we used four species of leaf warblers from the genus Phylloscopus. In the study area, five \nbreeding species of Phylloscopus warblers are present (Askeyev and Askeyev 1999). These are \nChiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita, Willow warbler P.trochilus, Wood warbler P.sibilatrix, \nGreenish warbler P.trochiloides and Arctic warbler P.borealis. In this paper we examine data on \n 4\nthe first four of these species, which are quite common breeding species in the study area. Due to \nlack of sufficient data, because the species is relatively rare, we excluded Arctic warbler from \nfurther analysis. All these species are long-distance migrants with wintering areas in Africa \n(Chiffchaff, Willow and Wood warblers) or the Indian sub-continent and China (Greenish \nwarbler) \u2013 for maps of distributions and basic biological information see Katti and Price (2003). \nThis study provides a great opportunity to test co-fluctuations between morphologically and \nhabitually similar bird species, but which differ in their wintering grounds. If conditions on \nmigratory routes and in wintering places are important (as we assume, see above and Sparks et \nal. 2003; Gordo et al. 2005; Mitrus et al. 2005), the three African warblers should show similar \narrival patterns different from the Indian wintering species (Hubalek 2005). \n Our purposes in this paper are (1) to document the changes in arrival time of the leaf \nwarblers (genus Phylloscopus) in the 1957-2004 period, (2) to identify relationships between \ntime of arrival and air temperature in the breeding site in Tatarstan, (3) to examine the potential \nco-fluctuations between the arrival time of the four studied species.  \n \nMaterials and methods \nStudy area \nObservations of birds were carried out in the Kazan region of the Tatarstan Republic, Russia. \nThis region covers a large area of c.2500 km2 centred on the city of Kazan (55\u00b045\u2032 N, 49\u00b008\u2032 E ), \nand includes various habitats (sub-taiga coniferous\u2013deciduous mixed forests, farmland, rivers, \nlakes, and town and villages). The relief is a mostly flat or undulating lowland (55 \u2013 220 m a.s.l). \nThe continental climate of the region is typical of Eastern Europe. The average annual \ntemperature is 3.6\u00b0C and monthly mean temperatures range from -12.1\u00b0C in January to 19.4\u00b0C in \nJuly. The lowest temperature recorded in our study period was -52\u00b0C, and the maximum 39\u00b0C. \nAverage annual precipitation is c.530 mm and snow cover lies for 141\u2013164 days.  \n 5\n \nPhenological observations \nFrom 1957\u20131979, dates of the observations of the first occurrence of warblers were recorded by \nKazan scientists (V.A. Popov, B.V. Nekrasov, R.A. Zatcepina, A.V. Popov, V.G. Ivliev) and \nthese records were extracted from the archive of the Laboratory of Biomonitoring at INSE \n(Institute of Natural Systems Ecology). Some data were published in Zatcepina (1978). \nObservations from 1980 to 2004 were recorded by two of the authors (IA and OA) of this paper. \nObservations were made daily from transects across the Kazan region and the recorder effort has \nbeen similar throughout the 48 years of study. \n \nMeteorological data \nMonthly mean air temperature data for the period from 1957 to 2004 were calculated as the \naverage of the Raifa (55\u00b055\u2019 N, 48\u00b043\u2019 E) and Kazan meteorological stations and collected \naccording to standard WMO protocols. \n \nStatistical analysis \nCalendar dates were transformed into days after March 1 (e.g. 1 for 1 March etc) prior to \nanalysis. Trends were calculated by regression methods. All statistical analyses were applied \naccording to the recommendations of Sokal and Rohlf (1995) and were conducted using \nMINITAB v.13. \n \nResults \nArrival date \nNone of the four species significantly changed their first arrival dates over the whole study \nperiod (Fig. 1), although Wood warbler was nearly significant (P=0.064).  \n 6\n \nThe influence of temperatures  \nAn examination of Kazan March temperatures in the 1957-2004 period (Fig. 2) do reveal a \nconsistent trend towards warmer conditions (P=0.004) by an estimated 4.1\u00baC over the 48 years. \nHowever, there was nearly a significant decrease in May temperature (P=0.055) equating to \n2.2\u00baC over 48 years. There was no significant change in February (P=0.14) or April (P=0.48) \ntemperatures.  \n Regressions between first arrival dates and the mean monthly temperatures for the month \nof mean arrival and the preceding month are shown in Table 1. With the exception of Wood \nwarbler, the species displayed a significant negative relationship with the temperature of the \nmonth of mean arrival (Fig. 3). The combined coefficients (Table 1) suggested a response to \nlocal temperatures of between 0.23 days\/\u00b0C and 1.55 days\/\u00b0C. Thus, fine tuning of arrival dates \nto local conditions (which may also reflect temperatures over a larger continental area) was \napparent. \n \nCo-fluctuation among species \nArrival dates of the three species wintering in Africa correlated very well (Fig. 4, r = 0.41 to \n0.65, n = 31 to 45 years, P < 0.008 in all three cases) but they did not correlate significantly with \narrival dates of Greenish warbler, wintering in the Indian subcontinent and China (Fig. 4; r = - \n0.01 to 0.11, n = 39 to 41 years, P > 0.51 in all three cases). \n \nDiscussion \nThe Phylloscopus warblers belong to a group of birds very popular for migratory studies, \nincluding phenology (Sparks 1999; Tryjanowski et al. 2002). However, European studies \ntypically concern two, sometimes three species (mainly Chiffchaff and Willow Warbler), and to \n 7\ndate we have not found a paper that focuses on the arrival dates of Greenish warbler. Greenish \nwarbler has a limited distributional range in Europe and is limited mainly to eastern and northern \nparts of the continent (Cramp 1992) and it overwinters in India, which is rather exceptional for \nEuropean avifauna (Mitrus et al. 2005). However our results are in contrast with Western and \nCentral European studies, where there is an increasing body of evidence that migrant birds are \nreturning earlier (reviewed in Lehikoinen et al. 2004) including three Phylloscopus warblers e.g. \nSokolov et al. 1998; Tryjanowski et al. 2005; T\u00f8ttrup et al. 2006). In this paper we  examined \nfirst arrival dates since information on the complete migration distribution is not available from \nthis part of Russia. Tryjanowski et al. (2005) and others have warned about possible dangers in \nusing this measure of phenology, although Sparks et al. (2005) and others have shown broad \nagreement between first and mean arrival dates. In this part of Russia the arrival period is \nrelatively short so that first birds are rapidly followed by others and we believe the first arrival \ndate to be representative. \nIn the analysed leaf warbler species we did not find significantly earlier arrival in \nTatarstan, which is not such a great surprise because local temperatures in the spring months did \nnot consistently increase. Indeed, the contrast between rising March and falling May \ntemperatures would be expected to affect fauna and fauna in different ways depending on the key \nmonths driving their phenology. However, because arrival dates of three of the analysed species \ncorrelated very well with local temperatures we predict that warblers can be good phenological \nindicators in the case of increasing temperatures. We have used a unique data set of observations \nthat could be useful in understanding the reaction of birds to climate change, even where \ntemperature changes are not detected. Three species\u2019 (Chiffchaff, Willow and Greenish warblers) \narrival dates correlated well with April or May temperatures, an appropriate period for arrivals in \nTatarstan. That for Wood warbler didn\u2019t quite achieve significance (P=0.116) with April \ntemperature, Table 1). As found by Marra et al. (2005) in North America the response to \n 8\ntemperature can be relatively modest, c. 1day\/\u00b0C, in locations where temperatures have not \nconsistently risen. Greater responses have been found elsewhere in Europe (e.g. Lehikoinen et al. \n2004).  \nInterestingly, the arrival dates of the African migrants co-fluctuated in a similar way \n(sensu Hubalek 2005), completely independent of the Indian migrant, the Greenish warbler. This \nsupports earlier suggestions that birds react not only to temperature in the breeding ground, but \non the whole migration route (e.g. Gordo 2005; Hubalek 2005; Mitrus et al. 2005; T\u00f8ttrup et al. \n2006). They probably start migration to breeding places from different wintering places \naccording to local signals, and just experience similar conditions at the end of their migratory \nroute. However, part of our explanation is of a speculative nature, because knowledge about the \ncues used by birds in the wintering grounds is very scarce, especially in the Indian sub-continent \nwhose wintering species are of relatively low research interest in Europe (c.f. Mitrus et al 2005). \n \nAcknowledgements We would like to thank V.G.
