INTRODUCTION \n \nThe incorporation of a few percent of nitrogen in semiconductor quantum \nwells (QWs) has recently proven to be a valuable approach in reaching long \nwavelength emission for GaAs-based telecommunication systems.1-3 In particular, the \npresence of a small amount of nitrogen in the InxGa1-xAs alloy causes a dramatic red-\nshift of the host material band-gap and an increased insensitivity of the band-gap \nenergy to temperature, T.4 However, fabrication of high-quality Ga1-xInxNyAs1-y-based \n1.55-\u00b5m devices remains a difficult task due to a large miscibility gap, which in turn \nresults in an increased tendency for phase separation and strong carrier localisation.5,6 \nHence, a careful optimization of the growth conditions is required. In the present \nwork we use magneto-photoluminescence (magneto-PL) to study carrier localisation \nin two contrasting samples: one grown at an elevated temperature and without lattice \nmatching between the QWs and the barrier material, and one with optimised growth \ntemperature and sample morphology. In this way we are able to build up a consistent \nphenomenological picture of the localisation of electrons and holes in the two \nsamples. \n  3 \nThe paper is organised as follows. In Sec. II, we summarise the growth details \nof the two samples under consideration, describe the experimental setup and introduce \nthe model we have used to analyse the data. Section III discusses the temperature \ndependence of the PL spectra in the absence of a magnetic field, B, as well as the \ntemperature dependent magneto-PL, while the conclusions are summarised in Sec. IV. \n \nII. SAMPLE DETAILS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP \n \nThe samples in this study, labelled A and B, were grown on (001) GaAs substrates \nby molecular beam epitaxy and nitrogen was incorporated using a radio-frequency \nplasma source.6,7,8 The active region for sample A was grown at 460\u00b0C and consists of \na 52 nm GaN0.007As0.993 barrier layer followed by five 8 nm Ga0.65In0.35N0.023As0.977 \nQWs between GaN0.007As0.993 spacer layers and another GaN0.007As0.993 barrier layer. \nSample B, grown at 325\u00b0C, has the same structure but has three Ga0.62In0.38N0.03As0.97 \nQWs between Ga0.977In0.023N0.01As0.99 barriers. The GaN0.007As0.993 barriers in \nsample A are tensile-strained and thus act as strain compensating layers to the \ncompressively strained QWs, while the small addition of indium to the barrier \nmaterial in sample B reduces the strain at the QW\/barrier interface and improves the \noptical and structural properties of the QW.6,9 PL spectra were obtained in a He bath \nand a He flow cryostat at temperatures between 4.2 and 200 K, located in the bore of \neither a home-made pulsed field coil or a superconducting 12 T magnet. Magnetic \nfield pulses of 20 ms and up to 50 T were delivered using a 5 kV, 500 kJ capacitor \nbank, during which several PL spectra were recorded using a 30 cm monochromator \nand a liquid-nitrogen-cooled InGaAs diode array. \nThe dependence of the centre of mass PL energy, Ecm, on magnetic field is \nanalysed using an excitonic model developed by Hayne and co-workers10 based on a \n  4 \ncontinuous cross-over between the low-field diamagnetic regime and the high-field \nLandau-level-like regime. Here, cmE  of a complete set of data is fitted using the \nfollowing equation: \n \n2 2\n2\n0 2\n2\n0 2 2\n2                for \n8\n2       for \n22\ncm\ncm\ne\nE E B B\ne\neE E B B\ne\n\u03c1\n\u03bc \u03c1\n\u03bc\u03bc \u03c1 \u03c1\n= + <\n= \u2212 + >\nh\nh h h\n (1) \n \nwhere e is the charge of the electron, h  is the reduced Planck constant and 0E  is cmE  \nat B = 0, allowing the determination of the average exciton wave-function extent, \n1 22\u03c1 , and the exciton effective mass \u00b5. \nIII. RESULTS \n \nIn order to investigate the degree of localisation in our samples, we have \nexamined the temperature dependence of the PL energy for both samples (Fig. 1). In \nagreement with earlier studies,8,11-14 a nonmonotonic dependence of the PL centre of \nmass versus T is observed and is attributed to trapping and subsequent detrapping of \ncarriers by localised states. At low T, a slight increase in temperature thermalises the \ncarriers allowing them to reach regions with a higher degree of localisation, \nrecombination from localised states increasingly dominates the PL, and we find a fast \nred-shift with increasing T, which is due to the temperature-induced trapping of \ncarriers in low energy localised states.  \nAt around 100 K for sample A, and 50 K for sample B, carriers have enough \nthermal energy to escape the localisation, and redistribution toward the higher energy \nfree-exciton levels occurs, causing a decrease in the population ratio between \nlocalised and free excitons. This progressive carrier detrapping from the localised \n  5 \nstates shifts the centre of mass of the carrier distribution toward higher energy. \nConsequently, the PL signal is increasingly dominated by recombination from free \nexcitons, whose energy levels are higher than the localised levels, and a blue-shift is \nobserved. At higher T, a band-gap-like red-shift of the PL signal is found, showing \nthat radiation from free excitons only contributes to the PL. Hence, the temperature \ndependence of the PL energy has a sigmoidal form. The temperature at which the T-\ndependence recovers to a band-gap-like behaviour gives an indication of the degree of \nlocalisation, and, in general, an increase in nitrogen content in the QW increases this \ntemperature. Although the nitrogen incorporation in sample B is slightly higher than \nin sample A (x=0.03 and x=0.023 respectively), the local minimum of the s-shape \noccurs at higher T for sample A and is about 50 % deeper with respect to sample B \n(Fig. 1), testifying the stronger degree of localisation of the former. Additionally, \nprevious studies have shown that such a small difference in nitrogen incorporation \nshould not have dramatic effects on the properties of the alloy.6 \nThe inset to Figure 2 shows the dependence of the PL signal for sample A \nover six orders of magnitude of laser excitation power density. We observe a clear \nblue-shift when increasing the excitation power density, a phenomenon that is \ncommonly attributed to spatially indirect recombination.15-17 However, since we are \nstudying type-I two-dimensional structures, a spatial separation of the charge carriers \nis only possible by means of localised potential fluctuations that can trap electrons or \nholes. Indeed, the blue-shift of the PL energy with increasing excitation power has \nalso been attributed to carrier filling of the localised states.11 The PL peak exhibits a \nlow-energy broadening revealing the presence of localised states, but the signal \nbecomes increasingly more Gaussian at higher excitation powers, indicating that the \nlocalised recombination centres tend to saturate at higher excitation power \n  6 \ndensities.18,19 Figure 2 depicts the excitation power density dependence of the PL \ncentre of mass energy over six orders of magnitude. The blue-shift mentioned above \nis clearly present, and a small kink at powers of about 1 Wcm-2 can be noticed. \nAlthough it remains unclear what the origin of the change in slope is, we can rule out \nan excitation-power-induced cross-over to biexcitonic emission: the integrated \nintensity of the PL signal should have a quadratic dependence on the power density \nfor biexcitons, while a linear scaling is expected for luminescence originating from \nsingle electron-hole-pair recombination.20 As can be seen from Fig. 2, the dependence \nof the integrated intensity on the excitation power density is entirely linear: no \ntransition to biexcitonic recombination can be distinguished. \nPL studies with varying excitation powers for sample B reveal a completely \ndifferent result. Within the experimental errors, there is no detectable shift of the PL \npeak for laser power densities increasing over five orders of magnitude (not shown). \nSince the integrated intensity is, similar to the situation in sample A, characterised by \na linear scaling to the excitation power, we conclude that the recombination in \nsample B is also excitonic, but that the absence of a blue-shift demonstrates a \nconsiderable reduction in the localisation of the charge carriers. In order to work out a \nconsistent picture of the exciton localisation in our samples, we have carried out \nmagneto-photoluminescence experiments. \nThe inset of Figure 3 shows the raw PL spectra for both samples A and B at 0 \nand 48 T measured at 4.2 K. The low-energy broadening which is a typical \nmanifestation of recombination originating from localised carriers and is commonly \nobserved in Ga1-xInxNyAs1-y QWs,11-13,21,22 is present in the spectra of sample A only, \nnot sample B. Additionally, it can be seen that the line width, measured as the full \nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) of the PL signal, is significantly reduced going from \n  7 \nsample A to sample B (from 31 to 22 meV, respectively). The observed \ninhomogeneous broadening is the result of compositional and structural disorder, \nwhich is inevitably present in these quaternary structures,23 and hence is a reliable \nparameter to judge the optical quality of our MQW samples. The suppression of the \nlow-energy broadening and the decrease of the line width by about 30 % when going \nfrom sample A to sample B confirm that a lower growth temperature and the \nincorporation of indium in the barrier material (sample B only) have a positive effect \non the optical quality of Ga1-xInxNyAs1-y MQW structures.6,9 We should note that \napart from a low-energy broadening in sample A, a high-energy feature is present in \nthe PL signal of sample B only. Very little is known up to now about its origin, but we \nhave found that the feature does not exhibit a shift in energy as a function of neither \nexcitation power nor temperature (not shown here), suggesting that it cannot be due to \nfree-exciton recombination. In contrast, we do observe a shift of this feature with \nmagnetic field (inset of Fig. 3), excluding the possibility that it is a trivial artefact \nrelated to the experimental setup. \nFigure 3 shows the shift of the PL energy, cmE\u0394 , versus magnetic field for \nboth samples A and B at 4.2 K. The centre of mass of the PL peak of sample B is \ncharacterised by a linear dependence on magnetic field right down to the very lowest \nfields that can be produced with our pulsed fields set-up, whereas the data for \nsample A show a cross-over from parabolic to linear behaviour at around 8 T, \nindicating that for sample A, a stronger magnetic field is required to reach the high-\nfield regime. This shows that the exciton wave-functions in sample B, which has \nindium in the barriers and is grown at lower temperature, are substantially more \nextended than for sample A at these low temperatures. The spatial extent of the wave \n  8 \nfunction for an unconfined exciton is related to its effective mass through the Bohr \nradius \n \n0\n0.529\nBa m\n\u03b5\n\u03bc= \u00c5,  (2) \nwhere \u03b5  is the dielectric constant and 0m  is the mass of the free electron. Thus, a \nplausible reason to account for the change in the exciton wave-function we observe is \na decrease in \u03bc  when going from sample A to sample B. However, an analysis of the \ndata in Fig. 3 gives a very similar effective exciton mass of (0.090 \u00b1 0.005) 0\u03bc  and \n(0.0924 \u00b1 0.0003) 0\u03bc  for samples A and B, respectively, which is reflected in Fig. 3 \nby an almost identical slope of the cmE  vs. B curve in the high-field regime and agrees \nwith previously reported results for dilute nitrides.24-26 Hence, the change in wave-\nfunction extent derived from the difference in magneto-PL at the lowest fields cannot \nbe explained in terms of a change in effective mass. Since the magneto-PL \nexperiments were performed at very low temperatures, we are measuring \nrecombination between electron-hole pairs for which at least one carrier is localised. \nWe therefore propose that the reduced wave-function extent measured in sample A is \nrelated to the localisation effects already identified in the temperature dependence of \ncmE  (see Fig. 1). At this stage, the data indicate that the localisation keeps the carriers \nfurther apart for sample B than for sample A. \nAlthough the field dependence of sample B appears linear down to very low \nfields (see Fig. 3), a small parabolic regime still cannot be completely excluded. \nMoreover, the longer integration times (> 5 ms) required at higher T rule out the \npulsed field technique to perform temperature-dependent magneto-PL experiments on \nour samples. Given the low magnetic fields at which the cross-over between \ndiamagnetic and free-carrier behaviour occurs, magneto-PL in DC fields up to 12 T, \n  9 \nwithout limitations on the integration time, is an excellent method to study the carrier \nlocalisation in more detail, and will help us to distinguish between the effect of \nlocalisation on the electrons and the holes.27 From the pulsed field data we have found \nthat the exciton radius at very low temperatures is substantially more extended for \nsample B than for sample A since we were unable to detect diamagnetic behaviour for \nsample B. The analysis of the PL centre of mass energy as a function of DC magnetic \nfield (see inset of Figure 4) reveals a small parabolic regime in fields up to about 4 T \nat 5 K for sample B. Using Eq. 1 we can then determine an average value for the \nexciton wave-function extent of 17.5 nm, significantly larger than the corresponding \nvalue for sample A, which is 14.5 nm. \nThe inset to Fig. 4 shows that slightly increasing the temperature from 5 to \n50 K moves the cross-over point between the low- and high-field regime for sample B \nto much higher fields, but that it does not change much going from 50 to 100 K. \nCorrespondingly, the exciton wave-function extent is characterised by a rapid \ndecrease as a function of temperature, followed by an apparent saturation to a value of \n12 nm for T > 50 K (see Fig. 4), in agreement with earlier studies.14 For sample A, the \nsituation is similar, but less dramatic. At low temperatures, the excitons are more \ncompact than in sample B (equivalent to what was found in pulsed fields), and a \ngradual decrease toward the common value of 12 nm at 200 K is observed.  \nIV. DISCUSSION \n \nIn an effort to understand the behaviour we have observed, we will briefly \ndiscuss the influence of the growth temperature on the structural and optical quality of \nGa1-xInxNyAs1-y MQWs as previously studied by various groups.28-30 Transmission \nelectron microscopy (TEM) studies performed by Herrera et al.29,30 indicate that an \n  10 \nincrease in growth temperature enhances In\/Ga interdiffusion during growth, which \nleads to TEM-observable composition fluctuations in the structure. The intensity of \nthe TEM contrast is drastically increased when raising the growth temperature, and \nfor samples grown at very high temperatures (460\u00b0C), undulations with a periodicity \nof 20 nm are observed. The amplitude of the contrast is related to the FWHM of the \nPL peak in these samples, i.e. the TEM-observed degradation of the structural \nproperties when growing at higher temperatures causes a decrease in optical quality. \nAdditionally, the period of the contrasts observed in TEM is reduced when raising the \ngrowth temperature, indicating that the scale of the disorder is larger in the samples \ngrown at lower temperatures, although the amplitude is smaller. \nThis is entirely consistent with our results. Due to the difference in growth \ntemperature also present in our samples, the composition modulation in sample B is \nreduced with respect to that of sample A, and the length-scale of the disorder in \nsample B is larger than in sample A. The introduction of indium in the barrier material \nof sample B reduces the strain at the QW\/barrier interface, further lowering the \ninhomogeneity of the Ga1-xInxNyAs1-y QWs in the sample.6,9 Hence, the effect of \ncarrier localisation is expected to be much stronger in sample A, while the period of \nthe modulation is larger in sample B. The result is that in both samples the electrons \nmay be trapped by nitrogen-rich26,31 regions, while the holes may only be localised in \nIn-rich parts of the sample, separating them from electrons in the N-rich regions at \nlow temperatures (Fig. 5). In other words, at low T the electrons and the holes are \nbeing localised at different locations by nitrogen- and indium-rich regions \nrespectively, but the separation is larger in sample B, which was grown under \noptimised conditions, compared to sample A. Our results clearly corroborate the \nlocalisation picture as established by TEM in similar samples:28-30 the spatial \n  11 \nseparation between the electrons and the holes imposed by the disorder-induced local \nminima in the potential profile is more pronounced in the sample grown at lower T \ndue to the increase in the period between composition modulations. In contrast, the \nactivation energy required to free the holes and recover the free-exciton wave-\nfunction extent is smaller than in the samples grown at higher T due to the shallower \nlocalisation potentials: Sample B, which was grown at 325\u00b0C, exhibits a larger \nexcitonic wave-function extent (spatial separation of electrons and holes) at low \ntemperatures (~18 nm from the inset to Fig. 4), but this is more rapidly thermally \nquenched than for the sample A, which was grown at 460\u00b0C (separation of ~15 nm).  \nBetween 5 and 50 K, the exciton wave-function extent for sample B drops by \nabout 30 %, while the decrease is only about 7 % for sample A over the same T range, \nindicating that for sample B, the detrapping occurs at lower temperatures, in \nagreement with the zero-field PL energy dependence on T (see Fig. 1). Thermal \nexcitation of the holes from potential fluctuations due to local indium-rich regions \ninto the continuum shifts the nature of the dominant recombination from spatially \nindirect at low temperature to direct, hence reducing the exciton radius (Fig. 4). At \neven higher temperatures, the PL signal is dominated by recombination from free \nexcitons, and the exciton wave-function extent saturates. Assuming a simple, \nthermally-activated exponential decay of the exciton wave-function extent toward the \nfree-exciton radius of 12 nm, we obtain an activation energy of 7.3 meV (84 K) for \nsample A, while it is only 1.9 meV (22 K) for sample B, and recover the same \nasymptotic value of 12 nm for the free-exciton extent in both samples (see Fig. 4). \n It is interesting to note that the determination of the free-electron wave-\nfunction extent enables an assessment of the electron effective mass. At low \ntemperatures, where the electrons are strongly localised, a hole effective mass of \n  12 \n0.09 0\u03bc was found for both samples. At high T, where neither electrons nor holes are \nlocalised, the exciton radius is 12 nm for both samples. Hence, assuming that the \nintroduction of nitrogen has a negligible effect on the dielectric constant of the ternary \nhost material,32 we can use Eqn. (2) to obtain a value of the electron effective mass of \n0.18 m0. This is similar to what has been reported earlier for nitrogen concentrations \nbelow 2 % in GaAsN thin layers,33 but is larger by about a factor of two than the \nvalues reported by the same group for GaInNAs single quantum wells with \ncomparable indium and nitrogen concentrations.14 \nOn these grounds and from the observed activation and PL energies, we can \nthen proceed to construct a phenomenological description of the potential landscape \nin our samples as shown in Figure 5. Zero-field PL energies at low temperatures \nprovide a lower limit for the transitions between potential fluctuations during the \ninitial redistribution toward deeper localisations, while we can estimate the transition \nenergy between electrons localised in nitrogen-rich regions and free holes from the \nlocal minima in the sigmoidal T-dependence of the PL energy. By extrapolating the \nband-gap behaviour observed at high T toward 0 K, we estimate the band-gap for free \nexcitons, which amounts to 989 and 876 meV for sample A and B, respectively. The \nenergy difference between this extrapolation and the observed recombination energy \nat the local minimum of the sigmoidal zero-field T-dependence of cmE  gives a rough \nestimate of the electron localisation energy in nitrogen localisation centres,34 yielding \n21 and 13 meV for sample A and B, respectively. From the exponential modelling of \nthe decrease in exciton radius as a function of T we estimate a valence band \nlocalisation energy for the indium fluctuations of about 7 and 2 meV for samples A \nand B, respectively. Thus the localisation energies are about twice as large for \nsample A as for sample B. This is further supported by the behaviour of the data of \n  13 \nFig. 1, where the temperatures of the maxima and minima also differ by a factor of \ntwo for the two samples. \nV. CONCLUSIONS \n \nWe have investigated the behaviour of the excitonic emission for two \nGa1-xInxNyAs1-y MQW samples under the application of a strong magnetic field and \nhave proposed a microscopic picture of the localisation effects that are present in \nthese samples. All our observations confirm that the addition of a small percentage \n(2.3 %) of indium to the barrier material and the lowering of the growth temperature \nfrom 460 \u00b0C to 325 \u00b0C in sample B induce a considerable enhancement of the optical \nquality of the structure. The nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the PL energy \nis much weaker and occurs at a lower temperature for the higher quality sample, while \nmagneto-PL experiments evidence an increased electron-hole separation at low \ntemperatures, confirming the existence and nature of composition modulation \nobserved in earlier TEM experiments on similar samples. Thermal quenching of the \nexciton radius, as observed in the T-dependent magneto-PL, is attributed to \nredistribution of the holes from regions with indium-induced local potential minima \ninto the continuum, allowing them to move to regions where electrons are trapped by \nan excess of nitrogen. As T is further increased, the electrons become free as well, and \nthe PL is dominated by free-carrier recombination. The situation is similar for both \nsamples, but is more dramatic and occurs on a longer length scale for sample B, \nwhich was grown at lower temperature and with strain-relieving indium incorporation \nin the barrier material. An assessment of the potential profiles for both samples from \nour data leads to the conclusion that the localisation energies are reduced by at least a \nfactor of two in sample B. This assertion is further endorsed by the observation that \n  14 \nfor the low quality sample only, an excitation power dependence of the PL signal is \nfound. \n \nWe thank Dr. Q. D.

Phys. 97, 073705 (2005). \n31Since the indium- and nitrogen-rich regions across the sample appear in anti-phase \n[see e.g. M. Herrera, D. Gonz\u00e1lez, J. G. Lozano, M. Gutierrez, R. Garc\u00eda, M. \nHopkinson, and H. Y. Liu, Semicond. Sci. Technol. 20, 1096 (2005)], a lowering of \nthe conduction band due to local indium excess will be compensated by the \nsimultaneous relative absence of nitrogen. The effect of nitrogen incorporation on the \nconduction band energy is about an order of magnitude stronger than that due to local \nindium excess, and we can therefore safely consider the nitrogen-rich regions as the \ndominant localisation centres for electrons. \n32To our knowledge, only a few groups have reported studies on the effect of nitrogen \nincorporation on the dielectric constant of III-V compounds, yielding opposite trends \nwith increasing nitrogen concentration.

Lett. 78 1562 (2001).\n  19 \nFigure Captions \nFigure 1 (colour online): Temperature dependence of the PL centre of mass energy \nfor samples A (triangles) and B (circles). The local minimum in the s-shape, typical \nfor recombination from localised states, is more pronounced and appears at higher T \nfor sample A. The data for sample B have been shifted up by 100 meV for clarity. \n \nFigure 2 (colour online): PL centre of mass energy (squares) and integrated intensity \n(circles) as a function of excitation power density. A clear blue-shift, with a small \nkink at ~ 1 Wcm-2, is observed, hinting at spatially indirect recombination. The \nintegrated intensity is linearly dependent on the excitation power, confirming that the \nrecombination is excitonic. The excitation power dependence over six orders of \nmagnitude is shown in the inset for sample A. The blue-shift, combined with a \nreduced importance of the low-energy broadening of the PL peak, is clearly \nnoticeable. \n \nFigure 3 (colour online): The shift of the PL centre of mass energy versus magnetic \nfield. The line is a fit to the data of sample A using Eq. 1. For sample A, a cross-over \nfrom parabolic to linear behaviour occurs at 8 T (indicated by the vertical arrow), \nwhereas the data for sample B are linear down to very low fields. The inset shows the \nPL spectra for both sample A (red) and B (blue) at 0 (full lines) and 48 T (dotted \nlines) measured at 4.2 K. The low energy broadening is present in the data for sample \nA only. The line width of the PL peak for sample B is considerably smaller. \n \nFigure 4 (colour online): Exciton wave-function extent as a function of T for the DC \nmeasurements. At low T, the exciton radius in sample B is larger than in sample A, \n  20 \nbut as T increases, the relation rapidly reverses. Error bars are derived from the \nuncertainties in the fitting parameters in the analysis of the data following Eq. 1. The \nPL centre of mass energy shift as a function of DC magnetic field for sample B at 5, \n50 and 100 K is shown in the inset. In contrast to the pulsed field data, a small \nparabolic regime can clearly be observed. The lines are fits to the data using Eq. 1. \n \nFigure 5: Schematic representation of the potential landscape based on our \nobservations. Recombination energies in the figure are derived from PL centre of \nmass transition energies, and are approximate. The average separation of N-rich and \nIn-rich regions is estimated from our data as being 15 nm for sample A and 18 nm for \nsample B. \n  21 \n0 50 100 150 200\n0.955\n0.960\n0.965\n0.970\n0.975\n0.980\nShifted up\nby 100 meV\n \nE c\nm\n (e\nV)\nTemperature (K)\n Sample A\n Sample B\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 of Nuytten \n \n \n  22 \n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1 100 101 102\n0.970\n0.975\n0.980\n0.985\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98 1.00 1.02\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nIn\nte\ngr\nat\ned\n In\nte\nns\nity\n (a\nrb\n. u\nni\nts\n)\n \nE c\nm\n (e\nV)\nExcitation Power Density (W\/cm2)\nSample A\n4.2 K\n \nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\n In\nte\nns\nity\nEnergy (eV)\n 58 \u00b5Wcm-2\n 5.1 mWcm-2\n 0.52 Wcm-2\n 50 Wcm-2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 of Nuytten \n \n \n  23 \n0 10 20 30 40 50\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n0,85 0,90 0,95 1,00 1,05\n0,0\n0,2\n0,4\n0,6\n0,8\n1,0\n\u0394E\ncm\n (m\neV\n)\n \n4.2 K\nSample A\n\u0394E\ncm\n (m\neV\n)\n \nMagnetic Field (T)\nSample B\n \nB = 48 TB = 0 TB = 48 TB = 0 T\nSample B\nSample A\nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\n In\nte\nns\nity\nEnergy (eV)\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3 of Nuytten \n \n \n  24 \n0 50 100 150 200\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n Sample B\n12 + 3 exp(-T\/84)\n12 + 7 exp(-T\/22)\nEx\nci\nto\nn \nR\nad\niu\ns \n(n\nm\n)\nTemperature (K)\n Sample A\n \n \n 5 K\n 50 K\n 100 K\nSample B\nMagnetic Field (T)\n\u0394E\ncm\n (m\neV\n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4 of Nuytten \n \n \n  25 \ne-\ne-\nh+\nT > 100 K\nN In N\n4 K < T < 75 K\n4 K < T < 75 K\n~7 meV\n~ 989 meV\n> 965 meV\n> 958 meV\nSample A\ne-\n> 980 meV\ne-\nh+\nSample B\nN In N~15 nm ~18 nm\nT > 50 K 4 K < T < 25 K\n4 K < T < 25 K\n~2 meV\n~876meV\n> 864 meV\n> 862 meV > 870 meV\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5 of Nuytten \n \n"}
