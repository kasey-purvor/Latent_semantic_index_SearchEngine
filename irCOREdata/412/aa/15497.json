The economic development within Greater China is intense. \nBesides trade and investment, in terms of consumption, according to the spokesman \nof VISA, the credit-card company, credit card use in the Greater China region (Hong \nKong, Taiwan and the PRC) has recorded US$10 billion in 2004, an increase of 30 \npercent from last year. Within these areas, the PRC\u201fs credit card spending was the \nfastest of having an increase of 270 percent, which was equivalent to US$0.6 billion \nin 2004\n1\n. In 2007, according to Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Chinese \n(China mainland) credit card spending will rise to US$18.3 to US$19.6 billion.\n2\n In \nHong Kong, a list of economic boosting efforts, including the Closer Economic \nPartnership Arrangement (CEPA), Sojourn travellers and Pan Pearl River Delta \nRegional Co-operation, were bestowed from the PRC to Hong Kong in order to \nrejuvenate its economy after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARs) \noutbreak in 2003. In Macau, the re-election of Edmund Ho as the second Chief \nExecutive in August 2004 reiterated his skilful economic strategies in concentrating \non both casino and entertainment industry. These recent economic and political \ndevelopments pave the way for a concern of the future governance and interactions of \nGreater China. With one thing in common, their future economic and political \ndevelopment will be affected and challenged by the PRC, where market economy has \n 3 \nbeen adopted as the linchpin of economic growth.\n3\n The competition and cooperation \nbetween China and Hong Kong becomes increasingly more obvious. Business people \nand government officials came up with various measures and options to facilitate \nfurther integration.\n4\n \n  \nTo start with, the concept of Greater China is yet to be fully developed.\n5\n In a narrow \ngeographic context, it refers to the economic and cultural interactions among China, \nHong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Its political connotation, however, can be \nunderstood as a way in which the Chinese government attempts to lure Taiwan to re-\nunite with the PRC. Culturally speaking, Greater China can be more broadly defined \nto include many economic, cultural and social activities among Southeast Asian \ncountries, especially in the constitution of network-building and social capital \nformation.\n6\n Amongst the English literature, David Shambaugh\u201fs edited volume \nGreater China defined the parameter of how to study the concept from economic, \npolitical and cultural approaches.\n7\n Barry Naughton addressed the Greater China \nissues from another angle by looking at the nexus that constructs the existing \neconomic interaction and business collaboration of this ever evolving area.\n8\n Among \nthe Chinese scholars, Zhilian Huang and M. K. Nyaw approached the concept with \nparticular reference to their robust business activities, cultural variety, social network \nand people and money migration.\n9\n  \nThe composition of Greater China entails an emerging form of micro \ngovernance where an increasing evolution of sub-group interaction and cross-over of \neconomic and social activities has been generating a dynamic of change within the \nEast Asian region. Areas such as the Pearl River Delta (PRD), Bohai\/Yellow Sea \n(BYS) and the Tumen River Delta (TRD) are just some of the examples.\n10\n More \n 4 \nimportantly, they are beginning to bridge their economic and business relations with \nareas other than their regional context.\n11\n More recently, a Pan Pearl River Delta \nRegion (PPRDR) has been advocated by Huang Huahua, the Governor of Guangdong. \nThis initiative decides to incorporate the integration concept to include nine provinces \nin China \u2013 Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan \nand Hainan, plus Hong Kong and Macau. There are 450 million people in this region, \ncomprising US$5 trillion Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n12\n However, there is an \nenormous competition among these sub-groups. Apart from constituting the internal \ncompetition within Greater China, they also affect the traditional outlook of regional \neconomic competition in East Asia. One of the salient examples comes from the \ncompetition between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Before the changeover in 1997, \nHong Kong was a British colony. The competition came from the regional economic \ndevelopment with the other three tigers-Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. After \n1997, Hong Kong became part of China, and the echo of competition among other \nurban cities in China siphoned into daily media and newspapers. In 2002, a report on \nthe competitiveness between Hong Kong and Shanghai indicated that Hong Kong \noutperformed Shanghai in a list of indicators of competitiveness.\n13\n By 2003, however, \nHong Kong was criticised as needing to re-define its new positioning and economic \nstatus in the Pearl River Delta in order to keep maintain the competitiveness.\n14\n While \ncompetition within Greater is intense, there are several scenarios that may constitute \nthe future micro governance. \n \nTransnationalism, Network and Crossover in Greater China  \nGreater China is highly relevant to East Asian regional governance because its \nconcept, composition and competition indicate a micro governance, where intense \n 5 \nborder-crossing, time and spatial relevance and strong cultural bondage are \nintermingled in our globalized East Asian affairs. As Harry Harding correctly pointed \nout that the concept of Greater China is by no means clear. However, \u201e\u2026 but its very \nvagueness is one of its greatest virtues.\u201f15 Nevertheless, I shall concentrate on the \nmicro governance among the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong to illustrate the modes of \ndevelopment that are being constructed by their daily political, economic, trade, \nhuman and knowledge interactions.\n16\n Kenichi Ohmae provides an innovative model \nto study the economic activities of the nation-states, where more and more \ninteractions are being captured by the four Is: investment, industry, information and \nindividual.\n17\n \u201eThe end of nation-states\u201f mirrors the activities developed through \neconomic, social and political interactions in Greater China. He developed his ideas \nfurther in trying to locate the \u201einvisible continent\u201f in the globalized business and \neconomic nexus.\n18\n In such circumstance, the governance of the invisible continent has \nto be more eclectic to include the efforts of individual states as well as global \nsociety.\n19\n The importance of economic activities as the major linchpin connecting \nnation-states has been elaborated by Richard Rosecrance. He initiated a concept of \n\u201evirtual state\u201f where trade, human capital and flows of knowledge will construct a \ngenuine nexus of activities.\n20\n   \nTo understand Greater China, the social economic relations and the cultural \nand social bonds among Hong Kong, Taiwan and China should be studied not just \nfrom their geographical angle. Emphasis should be made through the economic and \npolitical forces that transcend the so-called geographic boundary among these three \nareas, particularly in the experience and daily social and economic contacts among all \nthe people who truly constitute the Greater China economic and social nexus. In other \nwords, as described by Thomas M. Wilson and Hastings Donnan, \u201e\u2026 borders tend to \n 6 \nbe characterised by identities which are shifting and multiple, in ways which are \nframed by the specific state configurations which encompass them and within which \npeople must attribute meaning to their experience of border life.\u201f21 In understanding \nborder-crossing and global immigrations, Saskia Sassen pointed out that international \nmigration driven by poverty was less convincing. An understanding of global \nmigration, perhaps, should be studied from the ways in which global production and \nmarket demand are most intense and robust.\n22\n Given that China is a gigantic hub of \nmanufacturing and production, it naturally attracts immigrants of whom are those \npeople moving across the boundaries among Hong Kong, Taiwan and the PRC. A \n\u201esignificant realignment in the social and economic structure\u201f is being constituted \nwithin Greater China.\n23\n  \nIn considering the time and spatial connection of Greater China, Sum Ngai-\nLing argued that various symbolic and human interactions, such as guanxi, of Greater \nChina \u201e\u2026 consolidate a reliable and effective social space of relatives, friends and \nbusiness partners to be called upon for utilitarian purpose.\u201f24 Such human interaction, \nfacilitated mostly in Chinese business circles either inside China or within the Greater \nChina, may give rise to some \u201eways-of-doing-things\u201f that can enhance business, \neconomic and even political activities. Other studies also demonstrate the facilitation \nof networking among the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Henry Yeung \ncontended that \u201eIn Chinese business, relationships are seen as a means to an end: \nChinese businessmen find it advantageous to rely on particularistic ties in their local \nand overseas business activities because of the restrictive institutional context of \nSoutheast Asia.\u201f25 In studying social networks that are generated by the economic, \nsocial and business activities among the Greater China, we should \u201e\u2026 regard \ndevelopmental networks as socially constructed by actors who are conscious of their \n 7 \nparticipation in networks and who understand these relationships as networks.\u201f26 In \nother words, given the incentive that social networks can lubricate economic and \nsocial activities, there should be ways in which these networking activities can be \nfurther invested in the Chinese circle because \u201e\u2026 a network can often be greater than \nits constituent part.\u201f27 Danny Unger, in order to demonstrate that \u201eSocial capital is the \nfossil record of successful past efforts to institutionalize ongoing cooperation,\u201f \napplies such concepts to explain how and in what ways that social networks can be \nbuilt among the overseas Chinese in Thailand as a socially constructed \nphenomenon.\n28\n Of course, in the case of overseas Chinese or Greater China, one of \nthe greatest criticisms of social capital is that those who do not have social capital \n(who do not belong to these Chinese communities) may be excluded from getting the \nbenefits from which social capital generated.\n29\n To map out the future development of \nGreater China, one of the most salient areas of interest is the economic geography \nthat constituted by the growing inter-relations of Greater China.\n30\n Some indicators \nsuch as \u201e\u2026 economic proximity, the degree of openness to trade, the relative intensity \nof trade, the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI), the amount of capital from Hong \nKong, Taiwan and Macro invested in industrial production and lastly, the density of \nair traffic\u201f may help to measure the degree of their interaction.  \nThese and many other theories on transnationalism help illustrate the change \nin Greater China with a certain degree of precision. They also demonstrate a way of \nunderstanding how Greater China evolves with those ingredients of change, economic \nopportunities, migration, social interactions and cultural exchanges, etc. Nevertheless, \nthose theoretical perspectives along the line of transnationalism or globalization paint \na picture that cannot capture the entire meaning behind the function and the \nmanifestation of Greater China. The solidarity coming from the Greater China is \n 8 \ndifferent in a sense that those actors (Hong Kong, Taiwan and the PRC) are highly \nhomogeneous in terms of historical, cultural, racial and social background. As \nHuntington recently warned the alarming influence of the highly homogeneous \nHispanic migrants into the United States,\n31\n by the same token, the economic, social \nand political interaction of the Greater China within that highly homogeneous \neconomies will certainly create some questions that require some in-depth analysis. \nTherefore, if we put the Greater China into a social microscope, we may discern some \nways and means of governance. It is in this direction that I am going to throw light to \nsome perspectives on the possible directions of interaction in Greater China.  \n \nMicro Governance of Greater China in Operation \n As I have mentioned earlier, the constitution of Greater China by the social, \neconomic, political, business and even daily commuting creates some soul searching \nquestions about the possible outcomes of their intense interaction.\n32\n To what extent \nhas integration been made within the Greater China through these interactions? Is \nChina the economic linchpin or does China need to co-operate in one way or another \nto facilitate the modes of economic development? What are the attitudes and \nstrategies used by Hong Kong or Taiwan when confronted with such an economic \ncum social behemoth?  \n These questions are not easy to tackle. Yet, if we try to work out a conceptual \nlinkage among these questions, we must ask where, and, under what conditions, the \ninteractions among the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong will lead to? According to Alex \nCallinicos, those individuals (an agency) will be interacting with the structure (the \nsociety) in order to make history.\n33\n To what extent does the agency affect the \nstructure depend on pace of interaction, level of interdependence and the synthesis of \n 9 \ntheir actions.\n34\n By the same token, people in the Greater China are interacting among \nthemselves through different channels-trade, migration, investment, work, tourist, etc. \nAs William Callahan maintained, the relations of the Greater China \u201e\u2026 are not \nmerely state-to-state diplomacy or patterns of international trade and investment, but \ninvolve less formal people-to-people relations, flows and disjunctures in a \ntransnational political economy.\u201f35 In addition, the Greater China that we are focusing \nis highly conditioned by Confucian culture that \u201e\u2026 is crucial for an understanding of \nthe political economy and the moral fabric of industrial East Asia.\u201f36 \nThe previous section indicates that transnational theory initially works quite \nwell in the case of Greater China in explaining their interactions. Yet, Hong Kong, \nalthough is still governed by \u201eOne country, two systems,\u201f has been moving toward the \nPRC not only economically. Many recent evidences indicate that Hong Kong is being \nassimilated into the contexts of China. Chief Executive Donald Tsang more recently \npromoted a new identity of \u201eNew Hong Kong people,\u201f which generally refers to the \ncombination between liberalism and Chinese nationalism.\n37\n The Economist once used \n\u201eslow boiling\u201f to describe this process. I shall argue that they are instead inadvertently \nto be moved along the way in which there is no alternative. Taiwan is once called a \n\u201erenegade province\u201f by the PRC. It becomes a mission and imperative for the PRC to \nre-capture Taiwan. In other words, transnationalism theory is not enough to explain \nthe conundrum of Greater China. The economic integration, business investment and \nthe people\u201fs moving in and out across the PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan partly \nconstitute the consensus of \u201eChineseness\u201f. Collectively, these inter-mingled economic, \nsocial and cultural elements help develop an emerging catalyst of change, which \nneeds some more analytical tools to further investigate. \n \n \n 10 \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Perspectives of Greater China\u2019s Interactions: The Four Is \n \n                  Modes of Development \n                                                                                                     H \n \n \n          (Integration)      \n                 A      \n           \n            (Independence)  (Interdependence )   \n                       D    B     \n \n \n                                                                      C \n         (Identity)      \n              G    \n           \n      \n           1997   Time \n \n \nFigure 1 indicates four possible perspectives that may be used as the \nconceptual tools to probe their interactions. The horizontal X axis represents the trend \nof their historical development. The vertical Y axis indicates the modes of \ninteractions among the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Line H represents the \neconomic influence of the PRC in Greater China. Line G represents the economic \ninfluence of Hong Kong and Taiwan in Greater China. What I am trying to illustrate \nis not individual economic development, which can go up and down. My argument is \nthat Taiwan and Hong Kong become less and less visible by moving into the swirl of \nGreater China economic development, where the PRC is the biggest player.\n38\n \nAccording to the survey that conducted by the Commonwealth Magazine in Taiwan, \nthere has been an indication of marginalization of Taiwan in four aspects: trade \ndependency on the PRC, decreasing of foreign direct investment (FDI), decreasing \nthe number of travellers and less Taiwanese students going abroad to study.\n39\n 1997 is \na reliable year of distinction because Hong Kong was returned to the PRC. In addition, \nthe 1997 Asian financial crisis proved to be extremely important to the consolidation \n 11 \nof the PRC\u201fs economic power in East Asia later on and the forth-coming debates on \nChina\u201fs \u201epeaceful rise\u201f and \u201esoft power\u201f.40 \nSuch combination of interactions gives rise to four possible zones of \ninteraction. I therefore tentatively call them four Is: Integration, Interdependence, \nIdentity and Independence.\n41\n The four Is attempt only to probe the opportunities and \nchallenges that lie ahead confronting with Greater China. Zone A is zone of \nIntegration, under which both Hong Kong and Taiwan merges with the PRC in terms \nof economic development. The process is ever changing and to be more \ncomprehensive by the day-to-day interaction. Zone B is zone of Interdependence, \nwhere economic interaction is one of the most important parts of the modes of \ninteraction. Nevertheless, the PRC cannot go it alone to perpetuate its economic \ndevelopment. Other factors such as the United States, globalization process and \ninternational organization also provide impetus to co-operate and co-ordinate with \nHong Kong and Taiwan. There are chemicals to be made underlying the globalization. \nIn other words, the world helps facilitate the interaction of Greater China by not being \npedestrian but actively in posing some principles in seeing the Greater China to \nfollow the track. In addition, Zone C is the zone of Identity. It demonstrates that the \nsocial interactions among the PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan act more independently \naccording to the general public\u201fs social and economic experiences. People living in \nthis social and economic milieu perceive more than they can digest in terms of \neconomic opportunities and political disposition. They turn to something different. \nArguably, it is very hard to read the mind of the people. Zone D is the zone of \nindependence. This zone illustrates that the interaction, especially in the case between \nthe PRC and Taiwan, has been held back by the independent movements in Taiwan \nduring the presidency of Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) \n 12 \nfrom 2000 to 2008. These four perspectives do not intend to cover all aspects of \ninteractions of the Greater China. Yet, they help us conceptualise the ever-changing \npolitical economy of Greater China.  \n \n \n \nIntegration \n Under Zone A, Taiwan and Hong Kong will merge with the PRC in terms of \ntheir increasing economic interactions, FDI and knowledge transfers, etc. economic \ngrowth. This development has been materialised through various mechanisms and \nprocesses. For instance, Hong Kong recorded 12.1 percent real growth of GDP in the \nsecond quarter of 2004.\n42\n  Yet, the recovery of Hong Kong\u201fs economy was created \nout of the \u201evisible hand\u201f from the PRC. After the SARs outbreak, The PRC began to \nlaunch various measures to boost the economy of Hong Kong by first signing the \nCEPA with Hong Kong government, under which many Hong Kong made products \nwould be excluded from tariff. CEPA became more extensive in the middle of 2004, \nand more Chinese investors would like to have reciprocal benefits to be able to invest \nin Hong Kong. In fact, after the signing of CEPA, it galvanised the search for \nbusiness opportunities with Hong Kong among some cities in China. Some \nneighbouring cities such as Foshan, Jiangmen, Dongguan, Shunde, Zhongshan, \nZhuhai began to search for ways and means of economic integration.\n43\n Later, in order \nto further enhance Hong Kong\u201fs economy, the PRC allowed more Sojourn travellers \nto come to Hong Kong to consume. Other more creative ideas such as Pan Pearl \nRiver Delta Regional Co-operation was put forward onto Hong Kong to materialise \neconomic integration.\n44\n To facilitate a better way for the daily activities for the people \ncrossing Hong Kong\u201fs border to China, the Hong Kong Immigration department \nbegan to issue a new identity card. It can be used to clear the customs by just \n 13 \ninserting the card together with putting your finger on the screening machine. This \nmechanism is a result of the government's policy toward integration between the \npeople in Hong Kong and their cross-border social and economic activities.  \n In terms of cross Strait economic integration, according to Karen Sutter, \n\u201eFurther cross-Strait economic integration and specialization seem inevitable given \nthe highly complementary nature of the economies of the PRC and Taiwan.\u201f45 For \neconomic benefit alone, further economic integration between China and Taiwan is \nbuttressed by the possibility of profit making, especially in terms of foreign direct \ninvestment. Charng Kao, Director of Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, \ndemonstrated that profit from investing in China could be obtained, especially for \nthose first movers.\n46\n The 1990s also witnessed many Taiwanese entrepreneurs \ninvesting in the PRC, making the division of production between Taiwan and the \nPRC an inevitable outcome of future development.\n47\n More interestingly, there is a \nnewly developed trend which is to build primary and secondary schools to cater for \nthe Taiwanese businessmen who\u201fs been in the PRC for a long period. For one thing, \nthose Taiwanese businessmen do not want their kids to be educated in the local \nschools in the PRC for fear of the political indoctrination. Secondly, it would be a \nmore economical way than that to send their kids to the international schools in \nChina.\n48\n \nAccording to the Investment Commission, Ministry of Economic Affairs in \nTaiwan, Taiwan had already invested US$37.7 billion in the PRC from 1991 to June \n2004.\n49\n In terms of remittance, in the first six months of 2004, Taiwan had made \nUS$870.45 million individual remittances to the PRC, up 57 percent from last year.\n50\n  \nIn the same period, International phone call from Taiwan to the PRC increased 34.9 \npercent with 137,073,340 calls all together.\n51\n Those telephone calls, whether due to \n 14 \nthe reasons of business activities or family affairs, genuinely construct a social and \nhuman network that facilitate transnationalism in today\u201fs globalised world society. As \nSteven Vertovec pointed out that \u201eOne of the most significant (yet under-researched) \nmodes of transnational practice affecting migrants\u201f lives is the enhanced ability to \ntelephone family members.\u201f52 Those calls and telecommunication help paint another \npicture behind the integration process that generated by the day-to-day economic and \nsocial activities between Taiwan and the PRC. In the study of Chinese \ntransnationalism, Donald Nonini and Aihwa Ong regarded \u201eChinese transnationalism \nas a culturally distinctive domain within the strategies of accumulation of the new \ncapitalism-both Chinese and non-Chinese-emerging over the last two decades in the \nAsia-Pacific region.\u201f 53  Other obvious integration process included the building a \nbridge from Hong Kong to Macau and Zhuhai. According to Michel Enright and \nEdith Scott, the economic benefit should be the heart of the discussion of such \nmassive infrastructure when economic integration is concerned.\n54\n The integration \nbetween Taiwan and the PRC is moving to another level beyond economic and \nbusiness investment but to more cultural and social factor such as education. In order \nto cater for the education of the children of those Taiwanese businessmen, there are \nlots of schools that established especially for these students.\n55\n Given the fact that the \npace of integration has been developed in different aspects in the Greater China, yet, \nwe cannot rule out the regional influence or the interdependence that entails their \ninteraction. \n \nInterdependence \n Zone B represents the zone of interdependence. Here in this area of interaction, \nthe economic relations among Hong Kong, Taiwan and the PRC not only work in a \n 15 \ncentripetal manner that is moving toward the PRC, but also become more \ninterdependent in a way that engenders mutual recognition and co-ordination. To \nbegin with, the so-called economic security has been gradually developed to come \ninto being a force of connection among the Greater China. Unlike the Cold War, \nwhen East Asian international relations were under the ideological contention \nbetween the United States and China, the post-Cold War international relations, very \nfrequently, precipitated the ideas of economic development and the importance of \nmarket mechanism in resolving economic conflicts.\n56\n  \nTo mention, the Asian financial crisis became a salient, if not classical, case \nthat shattered many people\u201fs dreams of Asian miracle. Yet, in the case of China, \naccording to Lowell Dittmer, \u201eOne significant strategic implication of the crisis has \nbeen to enhance the relative importance of China.\u201f57 That China did not devaluate its \ncurrency was praised by many Southeast Asian countries because they had already \nsuffered a lot due to the financial crisis and the \u201erescue\u201f from the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF). Greater China, on the contrary, was the region that affected \nthe least among the other countries. Taiwan did devalue her currency in October 1997. \nYet, she still recorded almost US$6 billion trade surplus in 1998!\n58\n Hong Kong\u201fs \neconomy was affected after the Asian financial crisis. Nevertheless, there was no \nsingle bank closed down immediately after the crisis.  \nTo China, the implication of the Asian financial crisis is that first, China \nbecomes economically more important in relation to other East and Southeast Asian \ncountries. Chinese currency was not, and still is not, an international currency, \nalthough economists are having different views on the liberalization and revaluation \nof the Chinese renminbi (Chinese currency).\n59\n To facilitate economic growth, China \nneeds Hong Kong to provide a window for receiving international financial \n 16 \nknowledge. As can be seem from the consolidation of Hong Kong\u201fs financial strength \nfrom the Asian financial crisis, Hong Kong also serves as a place for initial public \noffering (IPO) for many Chinese enterprises.\n60\n For instance, Air China and ZTE (a \nChinese maker of telecommunications equipment) wanted to raise US$750 million to \nUS$1 billion and US$350 million to US$400 million, respectively in the late 2004 in \nHong Kong.\n61\n Taiwan has other options to maintain the interdependence with the \nPRC. One argument maintains that Taiwan may use its economic power, through \ntrade and investment, to leverage a certain weight between economic and political \npower in terms of cross strait relations. In other words, as Greg Mastel contended, \u201e\u2026, \nmany Taiwan leaders perceive growing economic ties with China as a disincentive to \nmilitary action against Taiwan by Beijing. This viewpoint ensures a generally \nsympathetic ear in many quarters for the lobbying effort of the Taiwanese business \ncommunity.\u201f 62  The underlying assumption of this argument is that the relations \nbetween China and Taiwan is a repetitive game. As long as the interactions (trade, \ninvestment, immigration and communication) continuous, the long term relations \nshould be leading to a more co-operative manner.\n63\n   \nIn addition, the joining with international organisation, World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) provides \nanother platform for Taiwan to play Beijing\u201fs political influence against the \ninternational economic and political recognition. According to Gerald Chan, \n\u201eHowever, for a country in a situation in which state-to-state relationships are difficult \nto establish, like the case of Taiwan, participation in international organisations \nassumes a greater significance as a means to strengthen a country\u201fs international \nlegitimacy.\u201f64 For instance, the PRC began its re-application for WTO membership in \n1986. Eventually, both the PRC and Taiwan became WTO members in December \n 17 \n2001. In terms of cross strait relations, WTO serves as a linchpin for both countries to \nuse economic and legal means to solve issues relating to economic affairs. More \nimportantly, WTO, as one of the most important economic organisations in the world, \nallows certain disciplinary effects to take place between Taiwan and the PRC, \nproviding a valuable international forum to Taiwan to resort to international \nrecognition, if not sympathy.\n65\n  \n \nIdentity \n C refers to the zone of identity. The questioning of Greater China \nbeing indifferent from China\u201fs influence, in the first instance, seems impossible. It \nmirrors a similar tone that contended by Gerald Segal\u201fs 1999 article named \u201eDoes \nChina Matter?\u201f in Foreign Affairs.66 Needless to say, economic incentive, political \nand business relations all conjured up an ethos of relations, if not tied bondage, \namong Hong Kong, Taiwan and the PRC. However, in the case of Hong Kong, after \nthe collapse of the housing market, the risk of unemployment, the economic \ndownturn, the SARs outbreak, the half million demonstration on the street on 1 July \n2003 and the inability of electing their own chief executive; according to Yeung Au, \nHong Kong people began to realise that they should rely on their own. More and \nmore people become self-employed as a result.\n67\n They enjoy this risky but flexible \nworking style, especially for those with entrepreneurship. Yet, this trend is also likely \nto generate a sense of disassociation from the society, resulting in gradual decline of \nsocial capital.\n68\n Similarly, this \u201eliminal citizenship,\u201f69--being Chinese in nature and \nnurtured in the former British colony, creates an identity crisis, given the flux of \npolitical and economic maze.\n70\n  In anthropology, liminality studies, according to \nVictor Turner, refer to entities that are \u201cneither here nor there; they are betwixt and \n 18 \nbetween the positions assigned and arrayed by law, custom, convention, and \nceremonial.\u201d71 The July 2007 demonstration for the protection of Queen\u201fs Pier from \nbeing demolished was considered to be a reveal of the \u201ecollective memory\u201f among the \npeople of Hong Kong toward the consolidation of Hong Kong\u201fs unique identity (a \nformer British colony turned Special Administrative Region (SAR) under Chinese \nsovereignty).\n72\n  \nIn other words, the identity of Hong Kong people has been under-going a \ntransformation from the question of \u201edoes it matter?\u201f to \u201eall it [identity] matters\u201f. On \npolitical identities, the dichotomy of the landslide victory of the pro-Beijing \nDemocratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) over the \npro-democracy group in the District Election in November 2007 and the landslide \nvictory of the pro-democracy candidate Anson Chan over the pro-Beijing candidate \nRegina Ip in the by-election of the Legislative Council in the early December 2007 \nsent a clear distinction between social and political identity. In terms of social identity, \nDAB does the job of catering harmony and services on district level,\n73\n and yet, the \nlandslide victory of Anson Chan demonstrated that people still identify an open and \nliberal political environment, if an open election is given.   \n Taiwan\u201fs experience is not sanguine either. The economy of Taiwan \ndichotomises between two groups: the haves and have-nots. The haves are those \npeople who have been investing heavily economically as well as politically in China. \nThey tend to be more positive toward the economic relations between China and \nTaiwan. The have-nots are those people who do not or could not invest in China, \nresulting in placing all their political stakes in Taiwan. They feel that their economic \nopportunity and international space have been restrained.\n74\n Besides, if we believe that \nthe mass media does provide a certain level of accuracy in reflecting the social \n 19 \nsituation in Taiwan, the mass media actually paints a very different picture about the \ngeneral attitude toward the so-called China\u201fs influence. One intriguing example is \nabout the news reports on TV. On the same screen, there is an anchor presenting with \nsubtitles running at the bottoms, on the top and sometimes on the right telling the \naudiences other pieces of news happening elsewhere. If this is not information \nexplosion, this kind of multi-dimensional news reporting will certainly paralyse your \nsense, if not your mind. In addition, amount the hundred strong television channels in \nTaiwan, the coverage and the degree of diversification are literally to instigate people \nfrom listening to or understanding of local social, economic and political relations \nand across the strait. Some cluster of channels cover stock market predictions by \nsome financial experts, another cluster of channels covering those solo female \ndancers dressing in bikini, some other cluster of channels covering Buddhism \npreaching, amongst many other news channels, etc. If those channels reflect some of \nthe preferences of the audiences, one possible explanation would be that there are \nmany audiences who want to search for alternatives. Buddhism, for instance, is an \nalternative for those who want to disassociate from the reality, which is supposed to \nbe flooded with sins and different kinds of wrongdoings. By listening to the \nBuddhism preaching, one's mind and soul can be relieved, sometimes redeemed if \nfollowing closely those preaching. Although some channels seem to be tacky and \neven indecent, the government has no alternative but just to put up with this kind of \nmedia with an ostrich policy. Of course, from the TV station\u201fs points of view, the \nproduction of such programmes may probably be the own source of income because \nthere are viewers; and therefore there are advertisement.\n75\n Yet, it also can be \ninterpreted as a way in which neither does the government want to offend the people \n(the voters) nor does it want to offend the media (the umpire).\n76\n  \n 20 \nTo understand, many people become disinterested in either the jumping onto \nthe bandwagon of the rise of China or to stick with the idea of independence. They \nare being indifferent of the political and social situation. The mass media here \nprovides some \u201eneurotherapy\u201f to the public with \u201edancing dopamine\u201f, if not \n\u201einformation Prozac\u201f to cure the general public\u201fs depressive feeling towards the \neconomy or the politics. In the international environment, the rise of China gives rise \nto many talking points for people in general and some speculations and analysis \namong policy makers and academic workers.\n77\n Yet, among those Chinese (Hong \nKong and Taiwan) who experience and live with the day-to-day bombardment of the \n\u201eclear and present influence\u201f of the PRC, there comes those middle-ground ways for \nthem to choose away from the political and economic extremes. Yet, this \ncategorisation may not be exclusive in trying to capture the whole development of the \ngeneral public towards public affairs. They point to some illustrations which may be \nuseful in trying to examine the social response in Taiwan toward the rise of China.   \n \nIndependence \n The final zone D refers more towards the political situation, if not \nimpasses, between Taiwan and the PRC. The re-election of Chen Shui-bian, the \nincumbent president, as the new president of Taiwan in March 2004 re-inserted some \nunknown political as well as economic factors between Taiwan and the PRC. In his \nsecond term inaugural speech on 20 May 2004, Chen emphasized the need to revise \nthe constitution and the reconciliation of the ethnic differences. Although he did \nmention that he would establish a committee for cross strait peaceful development, he \ndid not mention re-unification.\n78\n That sort of political message has been translated as, \naccording to the PRC, politically intransigent and ideologically unforgivable. No \n 21 \nwonder on the eve of his inaugural speech, a group of Chinese Taiwan relations \nspecialists openly advocated Chinese nationalism through the three-abundance policy: \nabundant 2008 Olympic game, abundant economic development and abundant Sino-\nAmerican relations in order to pose some pressure, if not an ultimatum to the new \nleader of Taiwan.\n79\n  \nFor one thing, Chen\u201fs political ideology is to treat Taiwan as a sovereign state, \nmaking the PRC very annoyed. In an interview during his first term of administration, \nhe defined Taiwan as a \u201esovereign state \u2026. Neither the ROC nor the PRC is \nsubordinate to the other. I want to make it clear that Taiwan is not a part of, a local \ngovernment of, or a province of any country. This is a fact of history. We want to \nemphasize to the international community that, as a sovereign state, the ROC cannot \nbe downgraded, treated as a local government, or marginalized by anyone.\u201f80 Chen\u201fs \nwinning of the first election was considered as \u201eCondorcet loser,\u201f meaning that his \nwinning \u201e\u2026 was partly due to the difficulties faced by the supporters of the other two \ncandidates for strategic coordination in such a close race.\u201f81 In such circumstance \nwhere political legitimacy is based not on consolidated ethos but rather on the \nswinging and haphazard political demand, it is very tempting for Chen to resort to \nstrong political message, especially on cross strait relations, to retain his popularity.  \nThe cross strait relations dropped to the nadir when the PRC fired four \nChinese M-9 ballistic missiles between 8-13 March 1996 to the North coast of \nTaiwan. According to Barton Gellman, \u201eThe exercise designated by the Chinese \nmilitary as \u201cStrait 961\u201d was by many measures the most provocative ever staged in \nthe Taiwan Strait,\u2026\u201f82 The so-called \u201emissile crisis\u201f was the second missile exercise \nresulted from Lee Teng-hui (Taiwan\u201fs first elected President) visiting to his Alma \nMater at Cornell University in June 1995. The military exercise was a warning signal \n 22 \nto the Taiwanese before the general election. On winning the general election in \nTaiwan as the first elected President, Lee once downplayed his tone in his inaugural \nspeech by saying that he wanted to pay visit to the PRC for the betterment of cross \nstrait relations, if deemed appropriated by the Taiwanese.\n83\n In 1999, Lee, however, \ncame back with a stronger political ideology by publishing a biography named \nTaiwan di zhuzhang (With the People Always in My Heart).\n84\n The biography \nreiterated his idea of materialising \u201eTaiwan\u201fs Republic of China\u201f as well as his \nabhorrence toward the PRC\u201fs hegemonic style in boxing Taiwan to the \u201eone country\u201f \ncorner.\n85\n Even the Vice-President, Lien Chan, before getting elected, had clearly \nmentioned that \u201eWe hope Beijing will face the fact that China is divided and ruled by \ntwo equal and autonomous political entities.\u201f86  \nLee\u201fs autobiography mirrors Ichiro Ozawa\u201fs book Blueprint for a New Japan: \nThe Rethinking of a Nation, which called for Japan\u201fs to be a normal nation of \nequipping army and rewriting Article nine of the constitution.\n87\n They both wanted to \nchange the status quo. However, their ideas inevitably unsettled the stability in East \nAsian international relations. Therefore, in terms of cross strait relations, Lee was \neventually considered by the PRC as not having a real interest of unification. The \nState Department of the PRC published a White Paper named Yige Zhongguo di \nYuanze yu Taiwan wenti (The Principal of One China and Taiwan Issues) in February \n2000. It clearly mentioned that the re-unification process should wait no more and \ncannot be postponed indefinitely.\n88\n  \nAlthough the economic relations, as mentioned before, between the PRC and \nTaiwan did reflect a constant development, especially after the Asian financial crisis, \nhowever, the political deadlock between the PRC and Taiwan has changed very little \nsince the missile crisis. As argued by Taifa Yu, \u201eChina will have limited options short \n 23 \nof war to persuade Taiwan to start negotiations over national unification. Convinced \nof the dire consequences of democracy, China cannot coax Taiwan into negotiation \nby meeting its demand to democratize.\u201f89 Nor did the political deadlock relax in the \nearly 2000 when Chen Shui-bian replaced Lee as the new President. Steven Goldstein \ncontended \u201eWhat remains unchanged is the overall assessment that, given the full \nrange of objectives on all sides, there is little likelihood that the status quo of \ndeadlock will move in the direction of stable resolution.\u201f90  \nAlthough Taiwan issue has always become part of the antagonisms of the \nSino-American relations, the most tangible outcome was always resorted by selling \nmore military weapons to Taiwan in the name of self-defence. Diplomatically, for \ninstance, President Bush mentioned very strongly in December 2003 when having a \nmeeting with Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, in the White House that \u201eWe oppose \nany unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo. And the \ncomments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan indicate that he may be willing \nto make decisions unilaterally to change the status quo, which we oppose.\u201f91 The \ninternational discourse, in addition, also questioned the trouble-making style of \nTaiwan and the calling for the cautious U.S.\u201fs involvement in the cross strait \nrelations.\n92\n At some point, the question of military confrontation between Taiwan and \nthe PRC is no longer of \u201ewhether\u201f but \u201ehow\u201f-big scale, middle scale or small scale \nwar.\n93\n Taiwan\u201fs democratisation is in its \u201etransitional\u201f period where a consolidation \nprocess will need time to be nurtured.\n94\n On the contrary, as argued by Andrew Nathan, \n\u201e\u2026 the Chinese people must be profoundly transformed before they will be qualified \nfor democracy.\u201f95 Yet, given the PRC\u201fs re-unification motive and determination, the \ntime to generate a mature democratic political system in Taiwan or an initiation of \ndemocratic government in the PRC seem to be very remote, if not totally \n 24 \nunobtainable. After the Legislative Yuen election in December 2004, the Pan-Green \n(independent) force was weaken due to the losing of the seats in the Legislative Yuen, \nmeaning that the general public did not feel the same way as Chen\u201fs government did. \nThat mode of social and political demand was further substantiated by the direct \nflight between the PRC and Taiwan during the Chinese New Year in the early 2005. \nThe indictment of the misconduct of Ma Ying-Jeou (the most hopeful president-to-be \nfrom the largest opposition party [Kuomintang KMT]) was finally quashed in the \nsummer of 2007. More importantly, The legal fiasco revealed that there was a huge \nlearning gap over the understanding of the rules of law and legal impartiality in the \ncurrent political system of Taiwan.\n96\n  \nBefore Taiwan\u201fs Legislative Yuan election on 12 January 2008, I interviewed \nsome key members of the DPP in December 2007. One of the members mentioned \nthat election was a way to allow voters to express their grievances. \u201eThrough a vote\u201f, \nhe added, \u201eyears of grievances can be released.\u201f97 Yet, I suspected the question was \nthat sentimental and emotional behaviour could not necessarily be translated into \nlong-term economic growth, nor being able to consolidate the democratic values. The \nLegislative Yuan election resulted in a landslide victory of the KMT\u201fs winning of 81 \nseats, while the DPP barely securing 27 seats, out of the 113 seats in total. Such result \npartially reflected the incompetence of the incumbent government to iron out the \neconomic downturn of Taiwan during Chen\u201fs eight years of presidency, not to \nmention the corruption scandals of the family of Chen Shui-bian and other DPP \nmembers. The outcome of the election also proved that the kind of \u201esentimental \nbrinkmanship\u201f did not work. In addition, according to Arthur Ding, \u201eKMT\u201fs victory \ntotally discredited DPP\u201fs strategy in this regard and will help mend the decade-long \n 25 \ndivide. The DPP has to amend its policy and move toward moderation to effectively \nconduct the coming presidential campaign.\u201f98  \n \nOn 22 March 2008, KMT\u201fs candidate Ma Ying-jeou won a landslide victory \nof the presidential election of Taiwan, gaining 7.65 millions (58.45 percent) of the \nvotes, and his DPP counterpart, Frank Hsieh secured 5.45 millions (41.55 percent). \nOn the one hand, although the result spelt a further disapproval of the incumbent \nDPP\u201fs leadership, there were still a significant amount of diehard DPP supporters \nwho were very much pro Taiwanese identity. On the other hand, the election of Ma \nYing-jeou, other than his popularity among the Taiwanese, quickly galvanised a \ncatalyst of changes to the political stalemate in cross strait relations because of his \n\u201eone China\u201f idea. \nIn his opening speech of the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party \nof China on 15 October 2007, Hu Jintao, General Secretary of the Central Committee \nof the Communist Party of China (CPC) came up with a new resolution on cross strait \nrelations. He pointed out \u201eHere we would like to make a solemn appeal: On the basis \nof the one-China principle, let us discuss a formal end to the state of hostility between \nthe two sides, reach a peace agreement, construct a framework for peaceful \ndevelopment of cross-Straits relations, and thus usher in a new phase of peaceful \ndevelopment.\n100\n There are several meanings behind this suggestion. First, the ball is \nnow on the Taiwan\u201fs side and a response is needed from the Taiwanese government. \nSecondly, although there was no mentioning of the use of force to resort reunification \nin his speech, peaceful agreement can be interpreted as an ultimatum, if not accepted. \nMoreover, such policy can be interpreted as a policy to buy time, first for the smooth \nrunning of the Olympic in 2008 and to gather enough strength if further confrontation \n 26 \ndoes happen. Therefore, Ma\u201fs election certainly helped relax cross strait tension to an \nextent that further trust perhaps could be re-built. One immediate result was the \nmeeting between Vincent Siew, Vice-President elect of Taiwan and Hu Jintao, \nChina\u201fs president, in a Boao Forum in Hainan island on 12 April 2008. 101  The \nmeeting echoed some strong cooperative voices over the course of cross strait \nrelations. Back to the model, Ma\u201fs future effort can be interpreted as a testing ground \nto arrest the tide and to ameliorate further escalation of the demands for independence.     \nIn other words, between integration and independence, there should be lots of \nlessons to be learnt. The democratic development in Taiwan will be scrutinised by the \nPRC\u201fs government closely in trying to examine the ways in which cross strait \nrelations should be developed. These are learning and knowledge diffusion exercise \nbetween two governments. This is also a long enduring exercise that can be used to \nassess the wisdom of both governments. \n \nConclusion \nGreater China, like many regions in East Asia, constitutes political, social and \neconomic interactions that facilitate a nexus of co-relations. People, who live in the \nvast context of this geographical region, experience the change. Through daily \ninteraction, they help write the context of change through business activities, \ninvestment, migration, trade, culture, and academic exchange. As Sir Ernest Barker \ncontended \u201eYou must give your own blood to make the spirits of history and theory \nspeak.\u201f102 That is applicable in Greater China. People, the general public and the \nstatesmen, experience and continue to help conjuring up the empirical outcomes. I \nhave tried to use four Is (integration, interdependence, identity and independence) to \ndemonstrate the catalyst of changes.   \n 27 \nIntegration is constructed by the blending of economic resources and social \nactivities. The integration process is being formulated through a continuous effort. \nThe case of Hong Kong being integrated into the PRC was more or less historically \ndetermined. Yet, Taiwan\u201fs economic integration with the PRC is based on social \ninteraction, economic calculation and social development. Interdependence indicates \nthat there is actually a mutual reliance among the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong in \nterms of interaction. The Asian financial crisis illustrated that financial aspect is a \ngood platform to enable some mutual respects of the expert knowledge among one \nanother, for instance in the case of many Chinese businesses Initial Public Offerings \n(IPO) launched through Hong Kong\u201fs financial market. The interaction and \ndevelopment with the international organisations also provides some recognition of \nindividual\u201fs identity in East Asia international relations.  \nIdentity refers to the state of social\/political affairs of some general public in \nHong Kong and Taiwan when confronting with political demands and social and \neconomic changes. Their identity was an indication of social and individual\u201fs \nreactions. Finally, independence appeared to be a political choice under Chen\u201fs \npresidency, which concerned mostly the decision makers between the PRC and \nTaiwan. If independence has been chosen by Taiwan, the PRC will wage war to re-\nunite Taiwan by force. Taiwan\u201fs Legislative Yuan election on 12 January 2008 and \nthe presidential election on 22 March 2008 gradually shifted the course of political \ndevelopment away from independence because both are under KMT\u201fs control.
