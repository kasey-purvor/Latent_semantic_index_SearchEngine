Computer conferencing has been applied\nto education alongside a concern to develop co-operative and collaborative learning\nstrategies. The technology of computer conferencing has been identified as especially\nappropriate to a co-operative style of work. This study found that far from collaboration\nbeing an outcome of the deployment of computer conferencing it became in some sense the\nproblem. A common 'gloss' on the educational changes that are taking place, with the\nintroduction of new technologies for teaching and learning, is that the 'sage on the stage'\nis being replaced by 'the guide on the side'. This paper argues that this opposition rests on\nlittle substantial evidence or research. The moderator\/facilitator role advocated as\nsuitable for computer conferencing is shown to be deeply embedded in wider social\nactions. The orientations of the tutor are heavily inclined towards the demands of\nassessment. Successful computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is the outcome\nof the co-operative work of all the members of the conference. The application of CSCL\nrelies upon timely interventions by the tutor.\nA collaborative technology?\nIn a standard text on open and distance learning, computer conferencing appears with\nadvantages and disadvantages that rely on the capacity of the conference to 'facilitate' students\nand staff working together (Mason, 1994). Co-operation or collaboration are seen as\nunproblematic outcomes of the use of the computer conference. Hiltz noted that collaboration is\nboth technically facilitated and becomes a moral requirement that involves a respecification of\nthe teacher's role (Hiltz and Benbunan-Fich, 1997, p. 1). The outlook that associates\ncollaborative learning with computer conferencing can be found throughout a wide range of\nliterature (Mason and Kaye, 1989; Harasim, 1990; Kaye, 1992; McConnell, 1994; Harasim et\nal., 1995; O'Malley, 1995; Jonassen, 1996).\n27\nChris jones From the sage on the stage to what exactly?\nIn some educational literature co-operation and collaboration are treated as distinct approaches\n(Topping, 1992). In this paper they are treated as interchangeable, an approach justified by the\nindistinguishable definitions provided by many authors - see for example McConnell (1994);\nO'Malley (1995). Co-operative or collaborative learning is understood to mean learning that\ntakes place with students and tutors working together on academic tasks. It is argued to be\nfundamentally different from the direct transfer of knowledge by a largely one-way\ntransmission, the 'transmissive' model (Harasim, 1990; Hiltz and Benbunan-Fich, 1997). The\nterms are glossed over so as to provide an image of a movement from the 'sage on the stage' to\nthe 'guide on the side'. It can only be noted in passing that the transmissive model contains\nmany elements of co-operation and collaboration (Macbeth, 1990).\nModerator\nTwo recent texts illustrate the new role promoted for teachers associated with CMCs and\ncomputer conferencing. Jonassen comments:\nYour role as the teacher must change from purveyor of knowledge to instigator, promoter,\ncoach, helper, model and guide of knowledge construction. (Jonassen, 1996, p. 261)\nMason draws a comparison with other media:\nThe role of the computer conferencing teacher is the farthest removed from that of the\ntraditional lecturer... During the course . . ; the teacher's role is definitely one of facilitator\nand host rather than one of content provider and star of the show. (Mason, 1994, p. 42)\nThe two accounts converge on a style of teaching that emphasizes social skills and reduces the\nemphasis on content and personal delivery. The delineation of the moderator\/facilitator's\nfunction has been a recurrent feature of writing and research on computer conferencing (Kerr,\n1986; Feenberg, 1989; Mason, 1991). Mason comments that:\nThe idea of the expert teacher must give way to a network of supports and resources in which\neveryone has some kind of expertise to be tapped. (Mason, 1994, p. 47)\nThis paper explores empirically the practice of a tutor orientated toward providing a moderating\nrole with a view to examining the claim that computer conferencing leads to the adoption of a\nfacilitator\/moderator role.\nThe background to the research\nThe research was undertaken at Manchester Metropolitan University between 1994 and 1996.\nThe course unit, 'Technology in Communications', was part of the BA in Information\nTechnology and Society Degree (BAITS). The unit was taught online using the FirstClass\ncomputer conferencing system.\nWithin the constraints imposed by the availability of technology, the communications\ntechnologies under investigation will be used to deliver the course. Material will be sent\neither to student's own machines or to machines made available in the lab. This 'online'\napproach will be supported by face to face meetings.\n(BA Information Technology in Society Student Handbook 1994 supplement)\nThe online nature of the course was accompanied by an expectation that work would be done\nco-operatively in small groups without lectures.\n28\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nMethodology\nAn ethnographic methodology was employed to generate an adequate description of 'just what'\nhappened when university education was transposed from a traditional setting into the new\ntechnology. Within education the qualitative approach to research is well represented, in\nparticular the ethnographic tradition (Hammersley, 1986 a,b; Fetterman, 1984,1986; Eastmond,\n1995). The aim is to understand the setting from the point of view of those involved in it.\nEthnography is an intrinsically descriptive task that resists formalization. The methods used are\n'naturalistic' in the sense that they rely on the study of people and their activities in their natural\nenvironment (Fetterman, 1998). The form of ethnography adopted has been heavily influenced\nby work in CSCW (Computer Supported Co-operative Work) and ethnomethodology\n(Suchman, 1987; Heath and Luff, 1992; Hughes etal, 1993).\nFindings\nThis paper will examine the work undertaken by the tutor who was responsible for both the\ncourse design and delivery. Within the conferencing system the tutor had the 'Moderator' role.\nThe moderator in FirstClass is the person in charge of a specific conference, determining who\ncan contribute and setting levels of access, in contrast to the 'Administrator' who has control of\nthe conferencing system as a whole. The educational role of the tutor, in organizing the course,\ndetermining the content and arranging assessment, was combined with an organizational role\nbuilt into the software.\nCourse design\nPrior to the course, the tutor had identified a potential problem of the course having 'weaker'\nstructures online.\nStudents are given responsibility to do the work, what happens if they don't work? -\ntherefore deadlines - therefore a schedule of tasks, readings for example, log on, send a\nmessage etc. (Interview course tutor 10\/94)\nContinuous assessment and deadlines set throughout the course were devised as prompts to\nencourage the students both to work and to work online. A surprising omission from the\noriginal course documentation was any developed idea of collaborative working. In the first\nweeks of the course students were given handouts explaining course features. These notes\nimplied a form of group collaboration but there was little explicit acknowledgement of this\nelement. The course documentation placed little emphasis on collaborative and co-operative\nworking. The emphasis was on the 'flexibility' available for students in terms of when work\nmight be done, and the opportunity for synthesis and reflection. In contrast the expectation of\ncollaboration was clearly expressed at the first face-to-face meeting.\nThe course outline provided the mechanism for an anticipatory account of the course. It was\nthrough the production of this documentation that the tutor was accountable to the students and\nwider institution for the content and teaching methods of the course. It is through the detailed\ncontrol of what work is to be done and how that work is done that the tutor uses the resource he\/\nshe has provided in the course documentation and planning. The following two examples\nexplore how the collaborative nature of the course emerged and how the assessment procedure\ndeveloped.\n29\nChris Jones From the sage on the stage to what exactly?\nCollaboration\n. . . well let me just emphasise a number of points, computer conferencing is a collaborative\nactivity you have to work together, you don't just go off and work alone; you have to work\ntogether through the conferencing system.\n(tutor introducing course unit 10\/94)\nThe tutor made extensive comments on the process of the work done and gave advice for future\nwork. The first part of one message is included in Table 1.\nFriday, November 3,1995 10:59:27 am\nTIC95 MODULE I Item\nFrom: J .AC\nSubject Pats on the back, advice and a bit of a warning\nTo: TIC95 MODULE I\nI have been very pleased to see that a significant section\n2 ofTIC-95 students are acquiring the on line skills which\n3 we have been discussing over the last few weeks. I have\n4 received a number of replies via my post box to the\n5 queries that I raised on the work for module one.\n6 Furthermore, in at least two of the sub-conferences we\n7 have seen real debate about the constitution of groups\n8 and how marks should be allocated\n15 Some of the messages I have\n16 received have avoided the issue of relative\n17 contributions. I don't want to make a big issue out of this\n18 but I do want to award marks fairly so that effort is\n19 rewarded.\nTable I: An example of tutor advice and comments.\nThe tutor clearly puts a great emphasis on the process of collaboration and use of the system\n(lines 1-8). Equally emphasis is placed upon allocating marks to individuals so that 'effort' is\nrewarded (lines 18-19). This concentration on how the work was done inverted the intention to\nstress the content of the course not the 'system' or the method of work. It would seem that the\nday-to-day concerns of the tutor outweighed the original design consideration that the content\nof the course should not be submerged by the mechanism of delivery. It was seen by the tutor as\na diversion from the work he intended.\nAssessment\nThe question of individual marks illustrates a further tension within the structure of the course.\nWorking together and online activity were stressed by the tutor, but marks were allocated\nindividually. The tutor wanted students to collaborate and provide information in a way that\nstudents believed would undermine group coherence. Within many educational environments\nmarks are allocated individually and students are graded separately, so there is a tension\nbetween the pressure of assessment and the demands of group work.\nThe tutor's comments throughout the course show him to be concerned with academic\nstandards, a defender of course quality. Sections of an extensive message to all students are\nreproduced in Table 2.\n30\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\n5 First and foremost the mark for a particular group has been\n6 determined by the quality of the piece submitted. I have looked\n7 for originality, evidence of research into the topic and the\n8 degree to which the question set has been answered.\n9 Secondly I have looked at the way in which group members\n10 have worked together in constructing the answer and the\n11 efficiency with which material coming from different individuals\n12 has been put together into a coherent whole.\n(Tutor to Module 2 23\/1\/96)\nTable 2: Academic standards.\nThe tutor began by setting out standard marking criteria. Later a plea was made for analysis\n'which goes beyond description' dealing with abstract and conceptual issues. The tutor was\nadvising students on how to do academic work and also how to talk about it. The tutor ends by\nadvising students to read two sub-conferences as examples of good practice (Table 3).\n40 As you move to the end of this unit and prepare for your third yeai;\n41 you should be beginning to produce analytical work which goes\n42 beyond description and shows that you can deal with conceptual\n43 and abstract issues. We can leam from one another in this unit as\n44 all the work is available on the conferencing system. Please have\n45 a look at other contributions and see if you can find useful ideas.\nI\n46 recommend everyone to look at the report produced in the BLL\n47 group.This was a model of how material should be organised and\n48 how a coherent answer can be constructed. I recommend that you\n49 look in the xxxxx conference to see a good example of how a group\n50 sought to work together and had a good deal of success and some\n51 failures in achieving cooperation.\n(Tutor to Module 2 23\/1\/96)\nTable 3: Tutor direction and advice.\nThere were two related standards being applied, a common academic standard of intellectual\ndiscourse and a more specific injunction as to how to work within the conferencing system.\nThis displays an orientation in the conference through which the tutor is encouraging the social\nprocess of doing conferencing as well as providing academic guidance. The names of the two\nsub-conferences were garbled in the original message, possibly as the message was translated\nbetween word-processing packages. No one notified the tutor about this. I can only assume that\nno student followed the academic advice and tried to learn from the model sub-conferences.\nThe request for students to 'learn from one another' fell on deaf ears.\nAn exceptional case\nThere were several students who found group work difficult. One of these students, Ben,\nproduced work alone, which presented the tutor with a difficult assessment problem. In\nNovember 1995 the tutor sent a message clearly setting out his requirements:\n31\nChris Jones From the sage on the stage to what exactly?\nNo work will be accepted from individuals in module 2 and this means that anyone not\njoining a group is effectively opting out of this course unit, (tutor 7\/11\/95)\nDespite these clear guidelines he received a submission from a lone student and faced a number\nof students who were clearly not co-operating.\nNow my dilemma is what I should do about this . . . I want them to work together. The other\nproblem is the anomalies, Ben's a complete anomaly . . . Ben's produced a good piece of\nwork but he cannot work with others, so what sort of moderation can you bring in about\nbeing unable to work with others,. . . (Field Notes 16\/1\/96)\nBen was clearly thought by the tutor to be of an exemplary academic or intellectual level, his\nsubmission was identified as a model showing the required academic standard.\nFrom 12 February Ben sent one message a week asking for collaborators and suggesting\npossible topics. On 18 March Ben announced;\nI plan to work alone on a project as it looks as if there is little interest in collaboration from\nothers in the unit I have not finalised the subject area as yet . . . (Ben to TIC95 Projects 18\/3\/95)\nThis message was followed by another in Projects on 22 March. It was not until 16 April that\nBen asked for a sub-conference to work in. 'Roadrunner' was set up' reflecting a declared\ninterest in the link between road protesters and new technology. No messages were posted to the\nconference apart from the course tutor until 2 May 1996:\nno road project following a problem finding a focus . . . attached is my digital audio\nbroadcasting project submission. (Ben to 'Roadrunner' 2\/5\/96)\nThe tutor had begun with a rule that groups should have a maximum of five and a minimum of\nthree members. At the end of the unit he had a conference with a lone member who had not\nposted to the conference and had changed his subject without notification.\nOn 7 May the tutor commented:\nThen there is the problem of Ben. Last time I looked there was only my letter in the\nconference and he has changed his subject at the last minute; there is a real problem here. Do\nI mark him for non-co-operation? (Field Notes 7\/5\/96)\nWhen the marking had been completed I discussed assessment again and was told:\nBen's was the best but he didn't collaborate. I've penalized him for working on his own. If I\nwas blunt I would say it was mainly his fault. . . effectively he refused to collaborate. So his\nwork is reduced from 70 to 65 per cent, because a percentage of the mark was for\ncollaboration the mark for the project was less than the content. Let me be clear it was a\nnotional reduction. I mean, how do you decide on the reduction? (Field Notes 18\/6\/96)\nThe tutor had posted marks to all the sub-conferences explaining the marking scheme for the\nproject and a separate message reminding groups of the overall weighting that gave projects 50\nper cent of the course mark (Table 4).\nWithin the marks massaging the 'notional' reduction for Ben takes on a formal appearance\nbecause a definite proportion of the marks, 30 per cent, is identified as being awarded for the\nway the work was produced.\n32 ~\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nTuesday, June 4, 1996 130:28 pm\nxxxx Marks Item\nFrom: John A. Cawood\nSubject Project Mark\nTo: xxxx Marks\nIn marking these projects, I have taken into account firstly the content and originality of the report itself\nand secondly the use that the project team made of the conferencing system and how well individuals\nworked together I have awarded 70% of the marks to the report itself and 30% to the process of its pro-\nduction.\nTable 4: Project mark.\nBen's case casts light on the way in which definite course aims are subject to the working out of\nthe contingencies of the course's development. The 'plan' for all students to be in groups is\nrepeatedly unrealized and the tutor has to make ad hoc day-to-day decisions about whether to\nallow the situation to continue and then how to assess a student that is so clearly in breach of\nexpressed course criteria.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe nature of collaborative effort was orientated towards the expectations implicitly and\nexplicitly embedded in the course structure. The original course design mentioned little about\ncollaboration but was clearly designed around groups achieving the completion of a series of\nmodules. The tutor's initial comments raised the profile of collaborative working as a key\ncomponent of the course. How these features of the course were achieved was then subject to ad\nhoc and mundane interventions. Collaboration was not something that could be pre-planned,\neither by good software design or by the pedagogic design of the course unit. It relied upon in\nsitu day-to-day management of the conference.\nThis conclusion echoes some debate within the CSCW community about the status of plans\n(Bardram, 1997). Collaboration as planned action has an ironic status, in that the members of\nthe conference first must work together, collaborating in order to produce the context for their\njoint activity. The scheme for collaboration is a resource for the work rather than in any real\nsense determining its course. The assessment criteria clearly did not provide clear and definite\ninstructions for dealing with Ben's case. A range of contingent and situational factors was\nbrought to bear, including the student's wider status as a 'good' student. The tutor had to decide\nif and how he could penalize this student for his failure to co-operate. The practical implication\nof this observation is that the timely interventions of the tutor were a significant feature\nenabling the plan of collaboration and accredited academic success to be achieved.\nThe institutional position of the tutor is exhibited in the production and use of the course aims\nand objectives. The tutor controls the definition of what counts as success within the\nconference. Assessment confirms that the tutor is in the position of holding specialist and\nsuperior knowledge. Despite the equation of computer conferencing with collaborative learning\nand the shift from 'knowledge-giver' to facilitator, the wider educational context remains one of\nassessment and accreditation. The tutor is the first line of that institutional system of\naccreditation of knowledge, determining what counts and how much is enough.\n33\nChris Jones From the sage on the stage to what exactly?\nThere is of course a second sense in which the tutor remains in command of superior knowledge\ndespite no longer 'delivering' lectures. The tutors are likely to know the answers to the\nquestions they have set. Despite the emphasis on students as a resource, and on collaborative\nand group learning techniques, the tutor has a responsibility to 'know' the subject area. Even\nwhen relying on the students' own experience, the arbiter of the validity of these experiences\nremains the tutor, who is assumed to have a superior subject knowledge to the student The tutor\nthus remains in command of superior knowledge despite no longer 'delivering' lectures.\nThe moderator's role was superficially a more social and organizational role than that provided for\nin the 'transmissive' approach. However, it is clear that the tutor is orientated towards marking\nand assessment criteria that are deeply embedded in the wider institutional arrangements of the\nuniversity. The 'technology of accountability' within the educational setting ensures that the tutor\nremains in possession of superior knowledge (Suchman, 1993). In so far as the tutor becomes a\nguide it is still unclear whether they have to remain with the sage up on the stage. The tutor had\nhoped that the computer conferencing system would assist him in being able both to give a group\nmark and judge individual contributions. This was never achieved but the tutor used his plan to\naccomplish the marking consistently in the form of an individual allocation of marks. The plan for\nassessment was unwaveringly inadequate to guide the tutor without respecification of its terms to\ndeal with the variety of ways in which students orientated themselves to the course objectives. In\nthis way the plan had a reciprocal relationship with activity; the plan was itself made intelligible\nby the actions and in turn made those actions intelligible.\n1. Collaboration was a moral imperative not technologically determined in any strong or\nweak sense.\n2. The role of the tutor as moderator could be said to be constitutive of collaboration rather\nthan an outcome of the pedagogy and technology.\n3. The observations show how the ad hoc and day-to-day interventions of the tutor are\norientated around the requirements of assessment.\nAcknowledgement\nThe research for this article was conducted at the Department of Information and\nCommunications and the Department of Sociology at Manchester Metropolitan University,\nUnited Kingdom.\nReferences\nBardram, J.
