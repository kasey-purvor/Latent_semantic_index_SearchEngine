They argue that this situation highlights the\nneed to explore a theoretical basis for the use of ICT to support learning. The central\nargument of the paper is that the notion of affordances can make a significant\ncontribution to this endeavour. The paper aims to articulate the potential impact of\nthese affordances primarily through the development of a taxonomy. It draws on\nsocial constructivist theory to help understand and articulate the impact of these\naffordances.\nThe concept of affordances is potentially both rich and provocative. Conole and\nDyke provide a refreshing and diverse look at the theoretical basis for the use of ICT\nto support learning. We have structured our commentary around six questions that\nare provided by Conole and Dyke in their Discussion section. Whilst examining these\nquestions we highlight various issues raised by the paper, which we believe, need\nfurther consideration and clarification.\nCommentary\nQuestion 1: How valuable is the concept of affordances and does its application provide any \nreally new insight into the inherent properties of technologies?\nThere are really two questions here. This section will concentrate on the first\nquestion, which involves clarifying the central concept of affordances. This central\nconcept in the paper is only briefly explored before the paper moves to building a\ntaxonomy. McGrenere and Ho (2000) point out, however, that the concept of\n*Corresponding author: Learning Technology Research Institute, London Metropolitan Universi-\nty, UK. Email: t.boyle@londonmet.ac.uk\n296 T. Boyle & J. Cook\naffordance is not well understood, and that there is considerable ambiguity and\nconfusion in the use of the term. A brief exploration of how the concept has been used\nin the psychological and human computer interaction (HCI) literature helps to clarify\nthe important issues surrounding the different uses of this term.\nThe concept of affordance was developed by J. J. Gibson. Gibson (1977, 1979)\nargued for an ecological approach to understanding human perception. He argued\nthat the environment and animals have co-evolved. There are features of the environ-\nment that afford (i.e. enable) perception and action in that environment. They are not\nconstructed by the person. They exist independently in the environment, and are\ndiscovered rather that constructed by the human (or animal) actor. Thus a rigid\nsurface stretching to the horizon under our feet affords locomotion; an object of a\ncertain size affords grasping and so on. Gibson\u2019s concept has to be understood within\nthis ecological approach. He argues, \u2018The world of physical reality does not consist of\nmeaningful things. The world of ecological reality \u2026 does\u2019 and \u2018their meanings can\nbe discovered\u2019 (Gibson, 1979, p. 33).\nThe idea of affordances was popularized in the HCI community by Donald\nNorman in his book \u2018The Psychology of Everyday Things\u2019 (Norman, 1988).\nNorman, however, introduced a number of changes, which led to subsequent\nconfusion and variability in the use of the concept. The most fundamental\ndifference relates to Norman\u2019s concern, as a designer, with making affordances\nsalient so that users can easily perceive them. Norman conflates two important but\ndifferent things\u2014designing the utility of an object and designing the way in which\nthat utility is conveyed to the user. In his later work Norman acknowledges the\nconfusion and seeks to distinguish \u2018real from perceived affordances\u2019 (Norman,\n1998, p. 123).\nMcGrenere and Ho (2000) provide an informative analysis to clarify the situation.\nThey distinguish the utility of an object, the actions it affords for the user, from the\nusability of an object, which is related to the perceptual information that signals the\naffordances. They propose that there can be degrees of affordance (Warren, 1995),\nand that affordances can be related in sequential or nested structures. This analysis\nand clarity in the use of the term is missing in the article by Conole and Dyke which\nmoves rapidly to using the term before analysing and articulating it. The danger is\nthat it falls into the problem identified by McGrenere and Ho, \u2018 As the concept of\naffordances is used currently, it has marginal value because it lacks specific meaning\u2019\n(McGrenere & Ho, 2000, p. 8).\nQuestion 2: How valid is the methodological approach suggested?\nAnother important issue is a critical consideration of the \u2018taxonomic\u2019 approach to\ncapturing and representing the implications of the concept. Conole and Dyke argue\nthat practitioners are often unclear about how to use the technology appropriately.\nThey then present a taxonomy of ICT affordances as a contribution to solving this\nproblem. This taxonomy is grounded in the base of \u2018current social theory and\ncritique\u2019.\nUnderstanding and using technological affordances: a commentary 297\nThe affordances listed are various. The first is called \u2018accessibility\u2019\u2014the Internet\n\u2018affords\u2019 opportunities for accessing information and knowledge in a new way. The\nauthors, however, use accessibility in a non-standard way. They argue for a shift in\nthe primary challenge from finding to selecting relevant information. This diverges\nfrom the standard concern with accessibility as \u2018Access by everyone regardless of\ndisability.\u2019 (Web Accessibility Initiative: http:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/).\nAnother affordance proposed by the authors is \u2018Speed of change\u2019, which refers to\nattempts to understand the question of how technology can \u2018be used to enable\nstudents to navigate their way through the myriad of changing information and make\nmore informed decisions\u2019. However, it is left unclear how this can act as affordance.\nA large list of \u2018affordances\u2019 then follows in the paper; which includes diversity,\ncommunication and collaboration, reflection, multi-modal and non-linear learning,\nand so on. Rather than elaborating on how any one of these \u2018affordances\u2019 could be\nrelevant to a learner or a practitioner the authors tend to indulge in a certain amount\nof hopeful expectation that affordances and abilities will simply emerge; for example\nin the context of reflective affordances: \u2018Perhaps new forms of reflection and critique\nwill emerge in response to more transitory and digital text.\u2019\nQuestion 3: What other approaches might be taken?\nThe third question points to the theoretical tension introduced by the use of this\nconcept\u2014the slotting into a social constructivist approach ignores the quite different\ntheoretical framework within which Gibson developed the concept of affordances.\nThe concept of affordances arises from an (biological) ecological approach to human\ncognition and perception. The natural home for an approach based on Gibsonian\naffordances is not social theory. The concept might have been used to challenge the\nlimits of social theory rather than be simply being assimilated into it.\nA key question is\u2014does the concept of affordances really help? The authors\narticulate certain opportunities that the technology makes available to practitioners.\nThey then balance these positive features with difficulties or challenge that are raised\nfor users. If these barriers are not dealt with effectively then the opportunities may not\nbe exploited. How does the concept of affordance enrich this approach?\nIf we stick with Gibson\u2019s original concept, then one approach is to articulate the\n\u2018ecological\u2019 approach that is at the base of Gibson\u2019s concept of affordances, and to\ncontrast it with the predominant social constructivist approach. This theoretical\ntension could be uncomfortably productive, as Gibson\u2019s approach is (a) not construc-\ntivist, and (b) not social, though it is, in its own way, interactionist. The technology\nchanges the \u2018habitat\u2019 in which we live. This new habitat affords new ways of doing\nthings. An articulation of the affordances of this new environment enables us to adapt\nmore effectively to the (new) opportunities, and avoid the (new) pitfall where \u2018new\u2019\nhere may indicate a significant degree of change that has marked implications for\nadaptive behaviour. The transition from the natural habitat that concerned Gibson to\nthe technological habitat of ICT supported learning provides ample opportunities for\ntheoretical elaboration.\n298 T. Boyle & J. Cook\nQuestion 4: The approach suggested reflects a particular interpretation of social theory. Is this \na limitation and might a broader analysis of other social theories yield new insights?\nIf the term is going to be used in a post-Gibsonian way to focus on social factors,\nwhich could be productive, then there is an existing relevant body of work (e.g.\nLaurillard et al., 2000; Kreijns & Kirschner, 2001; Kreijns et al., 2002). Kreijns et al.\n(2002), for example, have proposed a theoretical framework for \u2018social affordances\u2019\nby suggesting the incorporation of certain properties in Computer Supported\nCollaborative Leaning (CSCL) environments. These properties are meant to act as\nsocial contextual facilitators, i.e. social affordances, to initiate and sustain learner\u2019s\nsocial interactions. Ultimately these properties are intended to create a social space\namongst the members of distributed learning groups. Kreijns et al. (2002) base their\nenvironment on a theoretical framework that suggests the embedding of certain prop-\nerties in CSCL environments: \nthat act as social-contextual facilitators relevant for the learner\u2019s social interactions. When\nthey are perceptible, they invite the learner to act in accordance with the perceived affor-\ndances, i.e., start a task or non-task related interaction or communication. (Kreijns et al.,\n2002)\nFurthermore Kreijns et al. (2002) include a software tool that aims to provide the\nlearner group with awareness about the others in the task and in the non-task context.\nTo merely provide affordances for group interaction may be insufficient for the\ndevelopment of a true knowledge-building community. Hewitt et al. (1997) have\nsuggest that a set of tools that permit the individual to monitor communal activity and\ntheir own participation in the activity is also required. This a productive direction that\nis currently being explored by Garnett and Cook (submitted). However, we note that\nthe authors briefly mention as a footnote a planned DialogPlus tool.\nQuestion 5: Practitioners are still exploring the potential of new technologies, and the current \nuses of technologies often do not take full advantage of the medium. Therefore, how can \npractice take full advantage of the affordances of ICT?\nand\nQuestion 6: Does understanding of the affordances actually get us closer to improvement in \npractice and is this a useful framework?\nFinally, we briefly comment on the potential limits in the scope of the application of\nthis concept to e-Learning and present an alternative. Developing taxonomies that\nmake affordances explicit so that practitioners can make informed choice about\nexisting technology may prove useful. However, perhaps another productive goal\nwould be to develop a framework that allows us to envisage new tools for learning and\nto describe the communicative contexts in which these tools could be used. For\nexample, Garnett and Cook (submitted) envisage the provision of various computer-\nbased tools to encourage learners to frame their activities in light of a problem (rather\nUnderstanding and using technological affordances: a commentary 299\nthan a topic), e.g. a tool to create discussion notes; a tool to author with (e.g. to\ndevelop a personal web page), a tool to structure learners\u2019 interactions in light of\nstatements of proposed problem solutions and information needed to advance that\nsolution. Located at the heart of these learning tools is a Community Knowledge\nMap. This map would be used to identify hot-spots of community activity and\nclusters of related work, and to depict the work of the entire community rather than\nthe work of an individual author.\nWhat is required in all approaches is serious attempts to include new empirical\nobservations of learning in the evolution of new frameworks, tools and systems to\nsupport (i) tutors as they make decisions about the use of new technology, (ii) learners\nas they learn, and (iii) systems designers and developers as they envisage new\ninnovative tools to support learning.\nConclusion\nConole and Dyke have provided a useful examination of the use of affordances to\nprovide a theoretical basis for ICT learning support. We hope some of the issues\nraised above lead to a productive debate in this area.\nReferences\nGarnett, F. & Cook, J.
