This study focuses on the adaptation to and com-\npensation for a force proWle presented to one stationary arm\nwhich is proportional to the velocity of the other moving\narm.

Our null hypothesis is that they\ndevelop a time-dependent template of forces appropriate to\ncompensate for the imposed perturbation. Subjects were\ntrained to make 500 ms duration reaching movements with\ntheir dominant right arm to a visual target. A force gener-\nated with a robotic arm that was proportional to the velocity\nof the moving arm and perpendicular to movement direc-\ntion acted on their stationary left hand, either at the same\ntime as the movement or delayed by 250 or 500 ms. Sub-\njects rapidly learnt to minimise the Wnal end-point error. In\nthe delay conditions, the left hand moved in advance of the\nonset of the perturbing force. In test conditions with faster\nor slower movement of the right hand, the predictive\nactions of the left hand co-varied with movement speed.\nCompensation for movement-related forces appeared to be\npredictive but not based on an accurate force proWle that\nwas equal and opposite to the imposed perturbation.\nKeywords Human \u00b7 Motor control \u00b7 Prediction \u00b7 \nTemporal delay \u00b7 Bimanual coordination\nIntroduction\nMany studies have investigated motor adaptation to veloc-\nity-dependent forces during unimanual point-to-point\nreaching movements (e.g. Scheidt et al. 2005; Shadmehr\nand Mussa-Ivaldi 1994). Adaptation is thought to involve\nthe training of an internal model which predicts the sensory\nconsequences of actions (Miall and Wolpert 1996),\nalthough bimanual coordination during and after adaptation\nis less well understood. In a recent study it has been shown\nthat subjects can learn to adapt to a force on one arm which\nis proportional to the velocity of the other arm (Bays and\nWolpert 2006). That study examined the generalisation of\nlearning to a new joint conWguration of the arm experienc-\ning the force, but did not touch on the temporal relation-\nships between the two arm actions. In contrast, Diedrichsen\net al. (2007) recently demonstrated a dissociation between\nstate- and time-dependent control. They used a task where\nsubjects made reaching movements with one hand and were\ninstructed to press a button with the other hand at some\npoint during the movement. When the two movement com-\nponents overlapped, temporal scaling of the arm movement\nappeared to result in temporal scaling of the button press\n(state-dependent control); when the movements were\nseparated by a time delay, this scaling did not occur (time-\ndependent control). However, this work focuses on a dis-\ncrete button-press and not a compensatory response to an\nimposed force.\nExperiments on grip force provide evidence of predic-\ntive responses. Witney et al. (1999) demonstrated that\nwhen subjects hold a virtual object in one hand which is\nacted on by the other after a temporal delay, the reactive\ngrip force that subjects initially employ to prevent the\nobject from slipping decays over time and is replaced with\nan anticipatory grip force prior to the onset of the load\nC.

When the load force was not generated by the sub-\nject\u2019s own action, no predictive grip force was found even\nwhen the motion was cued by a tone. In the same way,\nsubjects have been found to exhibit predictive grip forces\nwhen exposed to a self-generated sinusoidal load force but\nnot when a similar sinusoidal load force is imposed exter-\nnally, even though this pattern is predictable and easy to\nlearn (Blakemore et al. 1998). These results demonstrate\nthe importance of eVerence copy in the production of\nanticipatory responses.\nIn a similar vein, Blakemore and colleagues conducted a\nseries of bimanual experiments on sensory cancellation of\nself-produced tickle sensations (e.g. Blakemore et al.\n2000). They found that when subjects used a robot arm\ncontrolled by one hand to tickle themselves on the other\nhand, their subjective sensations of tickliness decreased\nduring synchronous movements and increased as the delay\nbetween the action of the hand controlling the arm and the\nonset of the tickle increased (Blakemore et al. 1999). These\nWndings can also be interpreted in the context of a sensori-\nmotor system which attenuates synchronous sensation\nbased on action prediction.\nThus, there is evidence of sensory prediction based on\ncontinuous voluntary action, and evidence of anticipatory\nresponses in coordination of load and grip forces, but\nwhether these have time- or state-dependency is not clear.\nWe wanted to investigate whether varying properties of the\nforce imposed on the resisting arm in both a state-depen-\ndent and time-dependent fashion caused comparable\nchanges in the behaviour of the resisting arm. We hypoth-\nesised that subjects would exhibit predictive coordinative\nresponses to delayed force feedback in a similar manner to\nthose displayed during the aforementioned grip force stud-\nies: after learning to compensate for the force, they should\nstart to make responses before the force is incident on the\narm. Furthermore, we expected these responses to co-vary\nwith the state of the arm but not with the timing of the\nforce, because of their origin in the forward model predic-\ntions of the arm.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants\nSix normal healthy right-handed adults (three male, three\nfemale) participated in this study after giving their\ninformed consent. Their ages ranged from 20 to 35 years\nwith a mean age of 24.5 years. None of the subjects had any\nknown motor or sensory abnormalities, and all had normal\nor corrected-to-normal vision. The experiment was\napproved by the local ethics committee.\nApparatus\nSubjects used both hands on a symmetric pair of robotic\nmanipulanda (vBOTs, cf, Bays and Wolpert 2006) to con-\ntrol the movement of cursors on a Xat screen monitor posi-\ntioned 1 m in front of them. The apparatus was connected\nto a computer that displayed the stimuli on the screen and\nthat also controlled and received data from the robots. Sen-\nsors in the motors of the robots allowed the position and\nvelocity of the manipulanda to be sampled at 1,000 Hz, and\nforces imposed by the robots were also updated at this\nfrequency.\nProcedure\nAt the start of each experimental trial, subjects were pre-\nsented with a 5 mm red circular cursor indicating the posi-\ntion of their right hand [moving hand (MH)], and a green\ncircular cursor indicating the position of their left hand\n[opposing hand (OH)]. They were asked to move the red\ncursor on to a 5 mm white circle in the bottom centre of the\nscreen and the green cursor into a 20 mm white circle in the\nbottom left of the screen to start the trial. Once these condi-\ntions were met, both the white circles and the green cursor\ndisappeared and a 20 mm blue target circle appeared in the\ntop centre of the screen. Subjects were instructed to move\nthe red cursor to the blue target within a time window of\n400\u2013600 ms from movement onset. If these timing condi-\ntions were met, then the target turned yellow to indicate\nappropriate movement duration. If the subjects moved too\nslowly, the target turned green; if the subjects moved too\nquickly, the target turned red. While subjects moved the\nMH to the target, the OH experienced a leftward force pro-\nportional to the forward velocity of the MH movement that\nhad its onset delayed either by 0, 250 or 500 ms. These\ndelays were chosen to ensure that, with movements of\n\u00bb500 ms duration, there was complete, partial or no over-\nlap between the MH and the forces on the OH. Subjects\nwere instructed to keep their left hand as still as possible.\nThe delays were experienced in three randomised blocks\nof 250 trials each. For the Wrst 150 trials, subjects were\ntrained with the selected delay to adapt them to the pertur-\nbation. The next 20 trials were \u2018test\u2019 trials at the same speed\nbut without colour feedback of movement duration for\ncomparison to future speed-modiWed test trials. These were\nfollowed by 20 \u2018top-up\u2019 trials in which the target again\nchanged colour to make sure that subjects were moving at\nthe correct speed. 20 more test trials followed, and this time\nsubjects were either asked to move more quickly or more\nslowly. Subjects were instructed to move \u201cas fast as possi-\nble, about twice the speed\u201d or \u201cas slow as possible, about\nhalf the speed\u201d for all 20 movements. They then received123\nExp Brain Res (2008) 184:261\u2013267 26320 more top-up trials to return them to the original speed,\nand then 20 Wnal test trials with the speed modiWed in the\nopposite way to the previous test trials. During top-up and\ntest trials in each delay condition, forces were applied with\nthe same velocity dependence as in the training condition\nand at the same time. The only diVerence between top-up\nand test trials was the lack of a colour change in the target\nin the latter.\nData analysis\nAll data analysis took place in Matlab. Since subjects\u2019\ninstructions were to keep the OH stationary during the trial,\nwe deWned \u2018error\u2019 as any deviation from the initial hand\nposition. The root mean square error and end-point error of\nthe OH were therefore deWned as the RMS distance moved\nby the hand during the trial and the diVerence between the\nhand position at the start and the end of the trial, respectively.\nThe x-direction was deWned as the left-right horizontal\nplane, and the y-direction was deWned as the forward-back\nhorizontal plane.\nPilot experiment\nPrior to the current experiment, 12 subjects participated in a\nsimilar study where they moved a cursor to a target with\ntheir MH and received a velocity-dependent perturbation\non their OH, delayed by either 0 or 250 ms, blocked and\ncounterbalanced across subjects. They Wrst adapted to the\nperturbation for 50 trials, and then took part in three coun-\nterbalanced blocks at slow, medium and fast speeds. The\nWrst 20 trials of each block contained no perturbation and\nwere included to allow subjects to train at a particular\nspeed. During these training trials subjects received colour\nfeedback about movement duration as described above. The\nremaining 50 trials were test trials at the same speed as the\npreceding training trials, this time with a perturbation as\nwell as the colour feedback. Five no-force \u2018catch\u2019 trials\nwere presented pseudorandomly during each block of these\ntest trials. In the main experiment we removed the colour\nfeedback during test trials to reduce subjects\u2019 cognitive\nload and also removed the catch trials so as not to interfere\nwith trial-to-trial performance (Donchin et al. 2003). How-\never, the catch trial data from the pilot experiment proved\nto be a useful comparison to the data from the current\nexperiment.\nResults\nBy the Wnal 35 trials of the training sequence, subjects had\nadapted to the perturbation such that the slope of the group\nmean RMS error in the x-direction over these trials in each\ndelay condition (Fig. 1a) was not signiWcantly diVerent\nfrom zero (Pearson\u2019s r, 0 ms: r = \u00a10.101, P = 0.562;\n250 ms: r = \u00a10.237, P = 0.171; 500 ms: r = 0.066,\nP = 0.706). Within-subject analysis in each condition found\nthat only two slopes were signiWcantly diVerent from zero.\nAs both were small and positive, we assume this indicates\nfatigue rather than adaptation to the perturbation. The mean\nvelocity in the x-direction of the OH (solid lines) and the\ny-direction of the MH (dashed lines) over the 20 test trials\nat the medium speed for each delay condition are plotted in\nFig. 1b. The MH velocity is shown time-delayed to illustrate\nFig. 1 Movement data. a RMS error of the OH over training sequence\nfor 500 ms delay condition, averaged across all subjects. An exponen-\ntial Wt to the data is shown to demonstrate learning. By the Wnal 35 trials\nadaptation was complete, as the slope of the RMS error across these tri-\nals was not signiWcantly diVerent from zero. b Mean velocities across\nsubjects for the test trials at the medium speed for each of the delay con-\nditions (black curves: 0 ms; blue curves: 250 ms; red curves: 500 ms).\nVelocity curves for the MH (dashed lines) are bell-shaped and time-\nshifted for each delay condition to illustrate the timing of the forces\nincident on the OH. Predictive responses can be seen for the 250 and\n500 ms delay conditions for the OH (solid lines) as positive-going\npeaks before the onset of the MH velocity and these are followed by a\ndeXection and then an overshoot. c Mean position data for the OH (solid\nlines) and MH (dashed lines) across subjects for the test trials at the me-\ndium speed for each of the delay conditions. Position curves for the MH\nare time-delayed. The OH is always pushed back (negative) by the\nforce before returning to the original zero position. Anticipatory peaks\nare diYcult to make out in this case but examples can be seen in Fig. 2a123\n264 Exp Brain Res (2008) 184:261\u2013267the impact of the velocity-dependent force on the OH at\neach time delay. The MH velocity curves exhibit the usual\nbell-shaped proWle characteristic of point-to-point reaching\nmovements. The OH curves for the 250 and 500 ms delay\nconditions show a small, positive velocity peak prior to the\npeak of the imposed force. This peak represents anticipa-\ntory rightward motion of the OH. Anticipatory responses in\nthe 250 and 500 ms delay conditions were also observed for\nthe slow and fast speed-modiWed test trials (not shown). In\nall delay conditions the OH is pushed back by the force\nbefore returning to the original position, as illustrated in\nFig. 1c; similar predictive peaks are in evidence for the\ndelay conditions in the position data. No evidence of antici-\npatory responses was seen in the synchronous (zero delay)\ncondition.\nOne aim of the experiment was to investigate whether\nthe predictive responses co-varied with the state of the\nmoving arm, so to investigate how the movement of the OH\nchanged with MH speed and with delay a 3 \u00a3 2 repeated-\nmeasures ANOVA (speed: slow, medium and fast; delay:\n250 and 500 ms) was performed on the amplitude of the\npredictive position peak of the OH. The zero delay condi-\ntion was not included because no predictive peaks were\nevident in this condition. We found that the amplitude of\nthe predictive position peaks increased signiWcantly with\nboth speed [F(2,10) = 14.214, P = 0.001] and delay\n[F(1,5) = 39.729, P = 0.014]. There was also a trend\ntowards an interaction between speed and delay [F(2,10) =\n3.876, P = 0.057]. These results indicate that the magnitude\nof the anticipatory movement by the OH increased as speed\nand delay increased (Fig. 2a, b). Data from the catch trials\nin the pilot experiment show similar behaviour in the 0 ms\ncondition when no perturbing force was incident on the OH\n(Fig. 2c, d).\nThe movement strategy subjects used during the task\nwas investigated by examining both the RMS error and the\nend-point error (displacement between the start and end of\neach trial) in the OH for the last 35 trials of the training\nperiod for each delay condition (Table 1). Repeated-mea-\nsures ANOVAs demonstrated that there was no signiWcant\nFig. 2 Evidence against time-dependent control. a Position data for\nthe OH averaged over all subjects for the Wrst trial at the slow (black),\nmedium (blue) and fast (red) speeds in the 500 ms delay condition. As\nthe speed increases, the magnitude of the predictive peak also increas-\nes, but the onset time is not aVected. b Average predictive position\npeak magnitude (and standard error) in the 250 and 500 ms delay con-\nditions for all three movement speeds. c Velocity data for the OH aver-\naged over all catch trials and all subjects in the pilot experiment at the\nslow (black), medium (blue) and fast (red) speeds in the 250 ms delay\ncondition. Again, the onset time is not aVected by the increase in speed.\nThe bold lines up to maximum velocity show that the traces are scaled\nversions of each other before corrective movements are made (from\nmaximum velocity onwards; Wne lines). d Average predictive position\npeak magnitude (and standard error) in the 0 and 250 ms delay\nconditions for all three movement speeds in the catch trials of the pilot\nexperiment123\nExp Brain Res (2008) 184:261\u2013267 265diVerence in the end-point error between delay conditions\n[F(2,10) = 1.762, P = 0.221] but that RMS error increased\nsigniWcantly with delay [F(2,10) = 5.518, P = 0.024]. Post\nhoc tests revealed that the 500 ms delay condition had a\nsigniWcantly larger RMS error than the 0 ms condition,\nthough the 0 and 250 ms conditions and the 250 and 500 ms\nconditions did not diVer signiWcantly. Furthermore, two-\ntailed one-sample t-tests showed that the end-point error\nwas not signiWcantly diVerent from zero for any of the\ndelay conditions [0 ms: t(5) = 1.721, P = 0.146; 250 ms:\nt(5) = \u00a10.005, P = 0.997; 500 ms: t(5) = 0.472, P = 0.657].\nThese results demonstrate that subjects were not able to\nkeep their OH still as instructed during the experiment, but\ninstead suggest that they were acting to return to the origi-\nnal position. The increased RMS error for the 500 ms delay\ncondition indicates that subjects found it more diYcult to\nstabilise their hand with a higher delay.\nDiscussion\nDuring the experiment we found that subjects were largely\nsuccessful at opposing the force on their left hand generated\nby the movement of their right hand whether it was delayed\nor not. There are several ways they could have compen-\nsated for the imposed force, and by testing their responses\nat two diVerent speeds we can distinguish between these\nmethods.\nFirst, they could simply have increased the mechanical\nimpedance of the opposing arm by stiVening the muscles.\nThis has been shown to be at least a partially eVective strat-\negy for perturbation tasks (Franklin et al. 2003) but it was\nnot the case here: the existence of the predictive peaks for\nthe delay (250, 500 ms) conditions showed that subjects\nwere actively moving to oppose the force before it was inci-\ndent rather than just stiVening up and waiting until it\nimpacted on the arm. Pilot data using catch trials on which\nthere was no perturbation showed that subjects were indeed\nmoving their OH at expected incidence of the force in the\nsynchronous (0 ms) condition. This behaviour demon-\nstrates that the subjects were not exclusively increasing\nstiVness.\nSecond, subjects could have learnt the timing and mag-\nnitude of the force perturbation as a \u2018template\u2019 during the\ntraining phase and produced a force proWle that was equal\nand opposite to the imposed force. They would then be able\nto reproduce this template with the OH at a Wxed time after\nthe onset of the MH. While this would be an eVective strat-\negy for those cases where the speed does not change, it\ndoes not appear to be the strategy employed in this case. If\nsubjects were simply \u2018playing back\u2019 a learnt force proWle\nthen we would not expect to see any change in the motion\nof the OH before the onset of the imposed force. In other\nwords we should see equivalent predictive OH movements\nfor all three test speeds, and it is clear that we do not\n(Fig. 2b); similar behaviour is observed in the catch trials\n(Fig. 2c, d). The magnitude of the anticipatory position\npeak (or, for the pilot catch trials in Fig. 2d, the magnitude\nof the initial peak) increases for the faster speed and\ndecreases for the slower speed, even in the Wrst trial of each\ntest block (Fig. 2a).\nPerhaps then something more sophisticated is going on?\nIf the movement was based on a time-dependent template\nof the force, subjects should have scaled the OH template in\ntime as they increased or decreased the movement duration\nof the MH (for the faster or slower speed). However, this\nbehaviour would result in early predictive peaks for the fast\ndelay conditions and later peaks for the slow delay condi-\ntions. While very early movements were occasionally seen\nthey appeared across all conditions and were most likely\nassociated with an erroneous simultaneous movement of\nboth arms\u2014usually these brief movements of the OH were\nquickly aborted and later predictive peaks were observed\njust prior to the delayed onset of the force. These early\npeaks appeared only rarely and did not vary systematically\nwith the speed of the movement. Thus, we see no evidence\nfor temporal scaling of a response proWle.\nA more comprehensive explanation for the anticipatory\nresponses can be found in the context of a state-dependent\nrepresentation (Diedrichsen et al. 2007). State-dependent\ncontrol is based on the idea of a predictive forward internal\nmodel (Miall and Wolpert 1996) which predicts the sensory\nconsequences of a descending motor command to the MH\n(Witney et al. 2000). Subjects could then use this informa-\ntion to generate a compensatory response in the OH\n(Wolpert and Flanagan 2001). The anticipatory responses\nwere dependent on the velocity of the MH when there was a\ndelay between its motion and the force onset. Moreover, the\namplitude of these predictive responses scaled with the\nspeed of the MH (Conditt and Mussa-Ivaldi 1999), but their\ntiming did not. This suggests that the responses were\nrelated to the state of the MH, rather than to the time of the\nMH\u2019s action. A state-dependent account of control in this\ncase predicts this scaling as the motion of one hand is\ndependent on the estimated state of the other hand.\nAre aspects of time-dependent control combined with\nthis state-dependent strategy? The fact that the onsets of the\nTable 1 Means (and standard deviations) of end-point and RMS error\nfor the last 35 trials of the training period for each delay condition\nDelay End-point error RMS error\n0 ms 0.29 (0.41) cm 1.04 (0.40) cm\n250 ms 0.12 (0.46) cm 1.15 (0.27) cm\n500 ms \u00a10.00 (0.62) cm 1.57 (0.45) cm123\n266 Exp Brain Res (2008) 184:261\u2013267anticipatory responses do not vary with increasing speed\nsuggests that the control exhibited may not be entirely\nstate-dependent. It is possible that subjects learnt to make\ntheir responses in a state-dependent fashion to the changing\nvelocity of the MH, but also learnt a time-dependent repre-\nsentation of when to make these responses with the OH.\nWhile internal models in the motor system do not seem to\nbe time-dependent during the course of an action (Conditt\nand Mussa-Ivaldi 1999), the initiation of a state-dependent\nresponse may well be able to be learnt in a time-dependent\nfashion. This interpretation ties in well with evidence from\nfunctional neuroimaging that timing processes and sensory-\nmotor processes are separate (Sakai et al. 2000). Further-\nmore, the observation that subjects are less able to stabilise\ntheir hand as the delay increases (Table 1) suggests that as\ndelay increases the uncertainty in the initiation of the\nresponse also increases, as would be predicted by the scalar\ntiming hypothesis that variability of timing increases with\nincreased interval (Gibbon et al. 1997).\nThe lack of predictive peaks in the movement of the OH\nprior to the onset of the force for the 0 ms delay condition is\nsimilar to the behaviour observed in grip force studies\nwhere grip force increases concurrently with load force\n(e.g. Witney et al. 1999), but in those studies the same\nbehaviour was seen in the presence of a delay. In the pres-\nent study, the anticipatory movements that appeared before\nforce onset in the delay conditions diVer from those\nobserved in the grip force studies. This apparent contradic-\ntion may be resolved Wrstly by considering the uncertainty\nin when to initiate the motor command and secondly by\nlooking at the diVerences between the grip force studies and\nthe present study. When the movement of the OH is initi-\nated at the same time as the movement of the MH, the\nmotor commands for both actions can be sent simulta-\nneously, minimising the uncertainty in when to make the\nOH movement. When there is a delay between movement\nof the MH and movement of the OH, the uncertainty\nincreases so it may be better for the motor system to start\nthe movement early.\nIt is possible that this pattern of behaviour is not seen\nin the grip force studies due to diVerences in the amount\nof disturbance caused by each task. SpeciWcally, uncer-\ntainty in timing in delayed grip force tasks leads to slip-\nping but this can be easily and quickly rectiWed by\nincreasing grip force. In the present experiment, uncer-\ntainty in the timing can cause the arm to be pushed far out\nof the \u2018comfort zone\u2019 of acceptable responses, which may\nnot be so easy to rectify. Motion of the OH before the\nforce is incident on it leads to the idea of anticipatory\nresponses as an eYcient way of minimising the total dis-\nturbance to the OH. The Wnal distance of the OH from its\ninitial position did not signiWcantly diVer from zero over\nall speeds and delays. Rather than keeping their hands as\nstill as possible, subjects were apparently attempting to\nget back to the initial hand position as accurately as possi-\nble. It may be a more eYcient strategy for the motor sys-\ntem to begin to make a compensatory movement, get\npushed back and return to the start position than to keep\nthe arm absolutely still.\nIn conclusion, we found that when opposing forces inci-\ndent on one hand were proportional and delayed relative to\nthe velocity of the other hand, subjects produced predictive\nmovements that peaked just before force onset. These pre-\ndictive peaks were modulated in a state-dependent fashion\nby the speed of the moving arm. We have therefore shown\nthat state-dependent predictive control is not only used in\ndiscrete bimanual tasks but also in opposing continuous\nforces generated by movement of the opposite arm. Even\nwhen the force on one hand is not incident until after the\nend of the movement of the other hand (the 500 ms delay\ncondition), this state-dependent control is still observed.\nQuestions remain as to whether some aspects of time-\ndependent control are also combined with this state-depen-\ndent strategy, but will need additional experiments to\nresolve.\nAcknowledgements We thank J\u00f6rn Diedrichsen and an anonymous\nreviewer for their helpful comments on the manuscript.
