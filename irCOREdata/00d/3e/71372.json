A purely viscous regime was only \napproached during experiments with Hawai'i samples. These experiments indicated that at \ntemperatures between ~1070 and 1130 \u00b0C, strain rate independent viscosities (>109 Pa s) \ncould be measured at strain rates less than ~10-2 to 10-1 s-1. At 800 \u00b0C, temporal variations in \ncomplex shear modulus and internal friction suggest that, over durations of up to 120 hours, \nstructural adjustments were occurring within some of the samples. This time-varying \nbehaviour of lava samples may be attributed to the slow closing (healing) of microcracks and \nsmall pore spaces resulting in the apparent stiffening of lava samples under annealing. Thus, \nthose parts of lava flows that undergo slow cooling will have more elastic properties. Regions \nwhich cool faster possess smaller shear moduli and higher internal friction due to thermal \nmicrocracking and less cohesion between crystals and the bulk glassy matrix. \nKey words: basalt lava, Etna, Vesuvius, Hawai'i, shear modulus, shear viscosity, oscillatory \nrheology \n \n1. Introduction \nThe rheological properties of basaltic lava are critical parameters in determining the \nadvance rates, morphology and final dimensions of basaltic flows. Rheology is controlled by \na number of factors, the most important of which are composition, temperature, crystallinity \nand bubble content. The effects of these factors on the viscosity of lavas between eruption and \nsolidification have been analysed by previous workers (Shaw et al., 1968; Sparks and \nPinkerton, 1978; Marsh, 1981; Ryerson et al., 1988; Pinkerton and Stevenson, 1992; \nPinkerton and Norton, 1995; Richet et al., 1996; Dingwell et al. 1998). At temperatures below \nDeleted: measured \nDeleted: was analysed using\nDeleted: oscillatory\nDeleted: is\nDeleted: ing\nDeleted: grains \nDeleted: , redox-cooling history\nDeleted: l\nDeleted: (at which lavas become \nviscoelastic) \nDeleted: lower \n  \n3 \n3 \ntheir eruption temperature, lavas display viscoelastic behaviour and, at temperatures below \nthe glass transition temperature, Tg, of their glass matrix, they are anelastic (Sakuma, 1953; \nBagdassarov, 2000). Field measurements carried out at high stresses (~103 Pa) and typical \neruption temperatures indicate that basaltic lavas have a rather moderate viscosity (>102 Pa s) \nand an appreciable static yield-strength (~102 to 103 Pa) (Shaw et al., 1968; Pinkerton and \nSparks, 1978; Pinkerton and Norton, 1995; Norton and Pinkerton, 1997).  \nThe stiffness of solidifying lava, the temperature range over which solidification and \nthe anelastic transformation occurs and the kinetics of fracturing and fracture healing \nprocesses are important parameters for lava flow modelling. Quantification of these processes \nmay be important, for example,  in the prediction of lava flow carapace generation or break \nup. Here, we present the results of viscoelastic measurements carried out on samples of basalt \nlava flows taken from Etna, Hawai'i and Vesuvius at temperatures in the range ~500 to 1150 \n\u00b0C. These reveal the importance of cooling rate of lava flows on the strength of lavas. \nExperiments designed to characterise the high temperature anelastic and viscoelastic \nbehaviours of glassy, crystalline and partially molten rocks are based on measurements of \nelastic modulus (G*) and internal friction (Q-1). Traditionally, these measurements are \nperformed using an inverted torsional pendulum (e.g. Day and Rindone, 1961; Gueguen et al., \n1981; Weiner et al., 1987; Versteeg and Kohlstedt, 1994) or by forced torsional oscillation \n(Beckhemer et al., 1982; Jackson and Paterson, 1987; Bagdassarov and Dingwell, 1993; \nGribb and Cooper, 1998). The forced torsional oscillation method used in this work has \npreviously been used to study the behaviour of both rocks (Berckhemer et al., 1982; Jackson \nand Paterson 1987; Gribb and Cooper, 1998; Bagdassarov and Dorfman, 1998) and glasses \n(Bagdassarov and Dingwell, 1993; Bagdassarov et al., 1993,1994). This technique allows the \nmagnitude of the complex shear modulus and angle of internal friction to be measured over a \nrange of temperatures and frequencies. \nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nDeleted: melting\nDeleted: melting point\nDeleted: behave as\nDeleted: materials \nDeleted: \nDeleted: a basaltic\nDeleted: as an anelastic \nmaterials \nDeleted: the \nDeleted: stiffness\nDeleted: generated microcracks\n  \n4 \n4 \n2. Apparatus \nThe experimental method consists of exerting small strain oscillatory torsion \ndeformation on cylindrical samples. The equipment (described in detail previously \n(Berckhemer et al., 1982; Kampfmann and Berckhemer, 1985, Bagdassarov and Dingwell, \n1993)) exerts a small sinusoidal torque (of amplitude ~10-3 N m) to the end of a cylindrical \nsample (8 mm in diameter, ~20 to 30 mm in length). A simple schematic of the device is \nshown in Fig. 1a. The sinusoidal torque applied to the sample is generated using a pair of \nelectromagnets (two microphone-type coils) connected to a synthesiser via a power amplifier. \nThe sample is fixed between two aligned alumina rods, onto which two sets of light \naluminium wings are also attached. The angular deformation across the sample is measured \nby pairs of capacitive pick-ups which respond to the movement of pure iron plates located at \nthe ends of the aluminium wings. The capacitive signal is detected and amplified using a 5 \nkHz-frequency bridge which is sampled using a PC. Calibration of the equipment has been \ndescribed previously (Bagdassarov, 2000), with shear modulus measurements being accurate \nto 3 to 5 % (due to thermal drift of the calibration at high temperatures). \n Although the mechanical design of the equipment has not changed from that used \nduring previous work, the data acquisition hardware and processing software have been \nsignificantly improved. For each measurement, data are collected over two periods of the \ntorsional oscillation (Fig. 1b). Data are sampled at up to 10 kHz, allowing 1000 samples per \nchannel to be acquired at the highest frequency used during experiments (20 Hz). At torsional \noscillation frequencies of 2 Hz or lower the number of samples per channel is limited to \n10,000. Sinusoids are automatically fitted to the collected data using a Levenberg-Marquardt \nalgorithm, and the shear modulus and phase difference between the applied torque and the \nangular displacement across the sample are calculated from the phase and amplitude \nparameters of the fitted curves. \nDeleted: harmonic \n  \n5 \n5 \nExperiments were carried out over the frequency range 0.002 to 20 Hz (at \napproximately 0.3 log intervals) and at temperatures between ~500 and 1150 \u00b0C. At high \ntemperatures, low frequency measurements were prevented by the onset of non-linear sample \nresponse. This was revealed by Fourier analysis of the data indicating the presence of \nharmonics of the torsional driving frequency. Automation of sampling and processing allows \nrepeated measurements and at high frequencies an average of twenty measurements was used \nfor most temperature-frequency points. At low frequencies, individual measurements take up \nto 17 minutes, so fewer experiments were averaged. \nDuring experiments the furnace was purged with a flow of Ar gas (5 cm\u00b3 s-1). \nInspection of the samples after experiments showed that oxidation (as indicated by growth of \nFe-(Ti)-oxides) had taken place only on the surfaces of the samples. Temperatures were \nrecorded using Pt-PtRd (S-type) or Ni-NiCr (K-type) thermocouples. Direct measurements of \nthe temperature field inside the furnace indicated that temperatures were reduced by up to 15 \n\u00b0C at distances of 10 mm from the hottest point. Although this spatial sensitivity implies that \nrecorded values were only accurate to ~15 \u00b0C as indicators of the sample temperature, relative \ntemperature changes within any one experiment are much better constrained (\u00b13 \u00b0C at 1000 \n\u00b0C). \n The data collected at each temperature-frequency point allowed calculation of the \nmagnitude of the complex shear modulus G*(\u03c9, T), and the phase shift \u03d5(\u03c9,T) between the \napplied torque and the resultant angular strain of the sample, where \u03c9 is the angular velocity \n(equal to 2\u03c0 multiplied by the applied frequency). From these results, the real, G', and the \nimaginary, G'', parts of the complex shear modulus, the internal friction, Q-1, and the complex \nshear viscosity, \u03b7, can be calculated from \n \n )sin()cos(\"' *** \u03d5\u03d5 iGGiGGG +=+=  (1), \nDeleted: magnetite crystals\nDeleted: \u00b5\n  \n6 \n6 \n \nG\nGQ \u2032\n\u2032\u2032==\u2212 )tan(1 \u03d5  (2), \n \u03c9\u03c9\u03b7\u03b7\u03b7\n'\"\"' GiGi +=\u2212=  (3), \n (e.g. Nowick and Berry, 1972).

In order to do this efficiently small conical grips (angle ~1\u00b0, length 4 mm) were \nmachined at both flat ends of the sample with a diamond tool. Complementary mating grips \nwere produced in the alumina rods and samples were cemented between the rods with a high \ntemperature cement (Polytec\u00ae). The assembly was placed in the torsion apparatus and the \nsample was then sintered to the rods for 2 hours at 150 \u00b0C and then for 24 hours at 500 \u00b0C, \nunder an axial load of ~8 N (e.g. Berckhemer et al., 1982). Measurements carried out using a \ndummy sample of Al2O3 have demonstrated that the effect of the cement on phase delay \nmeasurements was less than 10-3 rad. (Bagdassarov and Dorfman, 1998). \n \n2.2 Size and shape factors \n When temperatures increased during experiments, thermal expansion of the sample \nand the alumina ceramic rods was accommodated by a spring located at one end of the \napparatus.

Changes in sample length \nwere calculated from micrometer readings taking at the spring (to a precision of ~0.02 mm) \nand the correspondingly changed sample diameter (calculated by assuming conservation of \nsample volume) were then used to calculate the material properties. However, samples \nrecovered after experiments have shown that flow deformation was not continuously \ndistributed through the samples but was concentrated in the centre, producing distorted, \nbarrel-shaped, cylinders. This is a consequence of temperature gradients across the sample \nand due to it being supported at both ends. Thus, despite efforts to account for changes in the \nsample shape, the deviation from a cylindrical form introduced errors (<2 %) in the assumed \ndiameter of the sample, once sample shortening has started. \n  \n2.3 Sample description  \nThe experiments were carried out on samples of basaltic lavas collected from three \ndifferent volcanoes, Etna, Hawai'i and Vesuvius. \na. Etna. Two samples from Etna were collected from lava erupted in 1992 which had \nponded after overflowing from a skylight in the Valle del Bove. One of these samples was \nfrom the top surface and one was taken from the base (~10 cm down from the surface) and \nthus represent samples with different cooling regimes. Digital images of polished sections \nwere obtained through an optical microscope and computer analysed, omitting corrections for \n3D effects. The surface sample has smaller vesicles (~0.2 to 0.5 mm, 15 to 20 vol.%) and \nsmaller crystal content (~20 to 30 vol.%) than the basal sample (~20 vol.% of 1 to 2 mm \nvesicles and ~30 vol.% phenocrysts. Images of polished thin sections are shown in Fig. 2. A \nfurther sample was collected from near the south east cone in 1999. This sample was taken \nfrom the least vesicular area found in a recently emplaced flow near hornito H3 (Calvari and \nPinkerton, 2002) at the top of the active flow field. \nFormatted: Bullets and\nNumbering\nDeleted: s\nDeleted: in the \nDeleted: . )\nDeleted: 2D-\nDeleted: of these samples were \nscanned CCD-camera and \nproceeded with the image \nDeleted: sis software without\nDeleted: corrections to \nDeleted: stereological \nDeleted: ).

The Hawai'ian basalt was sampled in the east rift eruption zone of Kilauea, \nHawai'i from a lava flow from a pahoehoe toe in September, 1984 (eruption temperature \n~1147 \u00b0C). This pahoehoe lava flow corresponds to the episode 25 of the eruption Pu'u 'O'o of \nKilauea Volcano. Its bulk chemical composition has been presented elsewhere (Garcia et al., \n1992). The chemical composition of the groundmass glass obtained by microprobe analysis \ndiffers from the bulk rock composition in SiO2 (52.3 wt%) and CaO (9.2%) content \n(Bagdassarov, 2000). The vesicularity estimated from 2-D image analysis varies from 46.8 to \n57.6 vol.%, or ~50 vol.% when calculated on the \u201cdry\u201d density rock basis. The sample has \nabout ~10 vol.% of olivine quenched from magma during sampling and a few percent of other \nphenocrysts.  \nc. Vesuvius. The Vesuvius samples were collected from the 1834 flow at Cava Ranieri \nin the national protected area of Terzigno approximately 6.3 km ESE of the central cone of \nVesuvius by the group from University College of London. Chemical analysis of the samples \nis given in Belkin et al. (1993). The same sample was also used by Rocchi et al. (2002) in \nexperiments to determine Young\u2019s modulus and tensile strength.  \n \n3. Results \n The shear modulus and internal friction results for the samples are given in Fig. \n3 to 6. The 1992 Etna samples (Fig. 3) show marked differences in shear modulus and internal \nfriction between the rapidly cooled crustal sample and the more slowly cooled basal sample. \nAs a result of its smaller volume fraction of vesicles, the crustal sample has a shear modulus \n~1.5 to 2 times greater than that of the basal sample at high temperatures (>1050 \u00b0C), \nincreasing to ~6 times at low temperatures (~500 \u00b0C). The internal friction of the crustal \nsample shows a relatively low dependency on frequency at high temperatures (>800 \u00b0C). At \ntemperatures between ~600 and 800 \u00b0C (Fig. 3c) a small, wide peak in internal friction \nsuggests a complicated behaviour at temperatures corresponding to that of the glass transition \nDeleted: and smaller \n  \n9 \n9 \nfor basaltic glass (Ryan and Sammis, 1981). For Pu'u 'O'o paheohoe lavas, the glass transition \nand melting temperatures are 655\u00b0C and 1149\u00b0C respectively (Burkhard, 2001). In contrast, at \ntemperatures below 1000 \u00b0C, the internal friction of the basal sample (Fig. 3d) is a strong \npower law of frequency, Q-1 \u221d \u03c9 -0.35. The response of a purely elastic material would be \nindependent of frequency, and this frequency dependence indicates a partially viscous \nresponse even at ~600 \u00b0C. \n Similar experiments carried out on cores cut from the 1999 Etna sample not only \nreproduced the internal friction peak at low temperatures (~700 \u00b0C ) but demonstrated \nconsiderable temporal variations in the results (Fig 4). Over periods of up to ~120 hours, the \nmeasured shear modulus increased and internal friction decreased. After annealing, the 1999 \nsamples produced similar shear modulus and internal friction results (Fig. 4c, d) to those of \nthe 1992 Etna crustal material. At temperatures >1100 \u00b0C, Etna samples demonstrated an \nincrease of fluidity of several orders of magnitude and it was not possible to maintain them in \nthe torsion apparatus. \n The experiments carried out on the Hawai'i sample were extended to higher \ntemperatures because of the higher temperature of the sample\u2019s softening point. Similar \ntemporal variations to those observed with the Etna lavas were found and are shown in Fig. 5 \nat a temperature of 1102 \u00b0C. The results are broadly similar to those of the Etna samples with \nshear moduli of ~18 GPa decreasing to ~0.2 GPa as sample fluidity starts to rapidly increase.  \nThe results from the experiments carried out on the Vesuvius sample are given in Fig. \n6. During sample annealing the shear modulus increased but to a lesser extent than in Etna \nsamples. An increase in tensile strength and Young\u2019s modulus after annealing was also \nreported during bending experiments (Rocchi et al., 2002). At the highest temperature \nattained during experiments (1132 \u00b0C) the shear modulus was less than 0.5 GPa and \npractically frequency independent. With a further increase of temperature the sample became \ntoo fluid for it to be held within the torsion apparatus. \nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nDeleted: Tg of\nDeleted: well below that at \nwhich the matrix softens.\nDeleted: groundmass \nDeleted: Pu\u2019u O\u2019o \nDeleted: reported in the \nliterature \nDeleted: melting\nDeleted: Tg =  \nDeleted: Tm = \nDeleted:  Similar changes have \nbeen previously observed in \nthermally cycled quartzite, granite \nand sandstones (Johnson and \nToks\u00f6z, 1980; Lu and Jackson, \n1998) and are thought to be due to \nthe presence and healing of \nmicrocracks. For example, rapid \nthermal cycling of granite and \ndiabase samples from room \ntemperature to ~800 \u00b0C results in \norder of magnitude increases in \ncrack porosity and a factor of 2 \nincrease in Q-1 due to the thermal \nproduction of cracks (Johnson and \nToks\u00f6z, 1980). Thus we interpret \nour data, which indicate an \nincreasingly elastic response with \ntime, as demonstrating the effects \nof healing microcracks in the \nsamples. It is likely that the \nmicrocracks were originally \ncreated due to thermal stresses \nduring cooling. Progressive \nvolatile loss could also be \nresponsible for strengthening the \nsamples, however this could not be \nused in order to explain the power \nlaw dependence of internal friction \nin the 1992 Etna samples at low \ntemperatures.\nDeleted:  \nDeleted: .

Discussion \nMeasurements of the complex shear modulus (G*) and internal friction (Q-1) of lava \nsamples from Etna, Vesuvius and Hawai'i show that they possess an appreciable shear \nmodulus (>0.5 GPa) and an internal friction generally less than 1, at temperatures where field \nmeasurements indicate viscosities of ~103 Pa s. For comparison, polycrstalline rocks at room \ntemperature have typical values of unrelaxed shear modulus, G\u221e, of about 50 GPa (Jackson, \n1993) and 25 GPa is representative for silicate glasses (Bagdassarov et al., 1993). Between \nroom and high temperatures prior to the onset of melting, values of Q-1 vary between ~10-3 \nand 10-1 (Manghnani et al., 1981; Weiner et al., 1987; Jackson, 1993; Bagdassarov, 2002). \nNatural silicate melts and glasses show a linear viscoelastic behaviour in the glass \ntransition temperature range (e.g. Bagdassarov and Dingwell, 1993; Bagdassarov et al., 1993). \nWith increasing temperature and decreasing strain-rate, one expects progressively decreasing \nshear modulus and increasing internal friction. However, the viscoelastic behaviour of lavas is \noften controlled by the presence of deformable (vesicles) and non-deformable (crystals) \nheterogeneities. Viscosity increases with increasing crystal content but decreases with \nincreasing vesicle content (Bagdassarov and Dingwell, 1992) and the presence of these \nmacroscale obstacles extend the shear stress relaxation spectrum towards longer relaxation \ntimes. Shear modulus relaxation can be extended over several hundred \u00b0C above the Tg of a \nbasaltic groundmass glass (~655 \u00b0C) up to ~1100 to 1150 \u00b0C. Over the same range, the \nfrequency dependence of shear modulus and internal friction becomes weaker, for example, in \nlavas Q-1 \u221d \u03c9-0.35, compared to \u03c9-0.5 for silicate melts. \nThe shear modulus and internal friction of our lava samples varied significantly with \nannealing time with, at temperatures between ~500 and 1000 \u00b0C, some samples becoming \nincreasingly stiff and elastic (Fig. 4).

For example, rapid \nthermal cycling of granite and diabase samples from room temperature to ~800 \u00b0C results in \norder of magnitude increases in crack porosity and a factor of 2 increase in Q-1 due to the \nthermal production of cracks (Johnson and Toks\u00f6z, 1980). Jackson (1993) interpreted the \nobserved increase in shear modulus and decrease in internal friction with the increasing \nannealing time to be a result of the reduction of porosity and increase of the grain boundary \ncohesion by a sintering processes. Progressive decreases in Q-1 have been associated with a \ndecrease of centres of stress concentration. Thus, we interpret our data, which indicate an \nincreasingly elastic response with time, as demonstrating the effects of healing microcracks \nand thermally produced pore space (not vesicles) in the samples. It is likely that the \nmicrocracks were originally created due to thermal stresses during rapid cooling of the lava \nflows, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that they could have been produced during \nsample preparation or the subsequent heating. In thin sections, microcracks within crystals \nand between crystals and the groundmass can be observed to have undergone some healing \nafter annealing (Fig. 7). \nThe production of microcracks suggests that rocks which have undergone slow \ncooling will possess higher shear moduli and have higher strengths than rocks which cooled \nmore rapidly. Thus, before annealing, samples taken from the centre of a cooled flow would \nbe expected to be more elastic than samples taken from the top of a flow. Under annealing at \nhigh temperature, the crack healing process consists of cracks pinching off and healing to a \npore-like shape before subsequent decreasing of the pore diameter (Atkinson, 1984). During \nthis period, the shear modulus may significantly increase and the internal friction decrease. \nThe time dependence of changes in crack lengths can be described as an Arrhenius function \nof temperature and, as a first approximation, a linear dependence between shear modulus and \na crack density parameter may be assumed (O'Connel and Budiansky, 1974).

The results of the fitting \nare presented in Fig. 8b in the form of an Arrhenian dependence of \u03c4, yielding an activation \nenergy of 150 \u00b1 20 kJ mol-1. According to Atkinson (1984) this value should relate to the \nactivation energy of the effective diffusion coefficient on grain boundaries of species \nparticipating in the pinching process at microcrack tips. For example, the activation energy of \ncrack healing in dry quartz at T< 600 \u00b0C is about 80 to 85 kJ mol-1 (Atkinson and Meredith, \n1987), corresponding to the activation energy of water diffusion in quartz (~60 kJ mol-1, \nDersch et al. (1997) or ~100 kJ mol-1, Brady (1995)). At high temperatures, crystal lattice \ndiffusion is the rate controlling mechanism of grain boundary diffusion. Thus, the observed \nactivation energy for the time dependence of shear modulus may be associated with an inter-\ndiffusion of Ca, Mg and alkaline species between olivine, clinopyroxene and plagioclase \ncrystals and basalt glass, with activation energies between 130 and 180 kJ mol-1 (Brady, \n1995). Alternatively, our results are also consistent with a self-diffusion of Si and O, network \nformers in basaltic glass, with an activation energy of 170 kJ mol-1 (Lesher et al., 1996). \nAlternative mechanisms which could contribute to the increase of shear modulus \nduring annealing of samples are redox and re-crystallisation processes in the basalt \ngroundmass glass. Progressive volatile loss could also be responsible for strengthening the \nsamples, however this cannot explain the power law frequency dependence of internal friction \nin the 1992 Etna samples at low temperatures. A contribution to shear modulus increase from \nsample oxidation would be due to the production of interface-controlled intergrowths of \npyroxene dendrites and Fe-(Ti)-oxides between 850 and 940 \u00b0C (Burkhard, 2001).

The oxidation kinetics of basaltic glass are \ndetermined primarily by the diffusion of divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ to the surface of the \nsample, which is charged compensated by the inward flux of electron holes (Cooper et al., \n1996). The activation energy of this process at temperatures below Tg is 210 kJ mol-1. The \ncalculated maximum depth (~1 \u00b5m at 600 \u00b0C and ~20 \u00b5m at 800 \u00b0C) of surface oxidation by \nusing the average divalent cation diffusion coefficient (Cooper et al., 1996) is small compared \nwith the size of lava samples used in torsion experiments and is in agreement with \nobservations made from thin sections of the samples. It should also be noted that these rates \nrelate to initially non-oxidised basalt glass samples and the lava samples should be considered \nas slow cooled, partially crystallised glasses, with long oxidation histories.  \nAt T> 920 \u00b0C, the bulk crystallisation of basaltic glass and growth of plagioclase \ncrystals may also contribute to the increase of stiffness of annealed lava samples, but the \ntimescales required are generally much longer than those of the observed changes in shear \nmodulus. For example, a noticeable growth of plagioclase and Fe-Ti-oxides has been \nobserved at 850-934 \u00b0C after >200 h of annealing basalt glass (Burkhard, 2001) and this \nprocess is likely to have continued for an order of magnitude longer time. In contrast, shear \nmodulus changes occurred much more rapidly in our experiments and generally ceased on a \ntimescale of <100 hours. Thus, neither redox or re-crystallisation processes are believed to \nsignificantly contribute to the measured changes in the rheological properties of the samples. \nConverting the shear modulus and internal friction data into viscosity (Eq. 3) shows \nthat both the Vesuvius and Etna samples maintained a frequency dependent real component of \ntheir viscosity (\u03b7') up to the highest temperatures attainable during the experiments (Fig. 9). \nTherefore, no \u201cNewtonian\u201d viscosity can be given for these temperatures at low strain rates. \nIn contrast, the Hawaiian sample demonstrated marked decreases in the frequency \ndependence of \u03b7' at high temperatures and low frequencies (Fig. 10a).

The small \nstrain-rate and small stress viscosity, \u03b70, measured for the Hawaiian sample represents a \ncreep-type mechanism underlying the Bingham yield stress which is expressed under \nconditions of slow, small scale deformation, where the internal structure of the lava sample \nremains intact. The presence of non-deformable crystals results in increases of this effective \nviscosity, but also increases the Bingham yield stress (Bagdassarov et al., 1994). Higher ratios \nof crystals to vesicles in Etna and Vesuvius lavas increase the Bingham creep-viscosity, \u03b70, \nand shift it toward smaller strain-rates which were unattainable in our torsion experiments. In \ncontrast, the Hawai'ian lava sample, with a smaller crystals to vesicles ratio, possessed a \nsmaller Bingham creep-viscosity which was observable at the lower strain rates of the torsion \napparatus (10-3 s-1). \nIf a material has a strain rate dependent rheology then two different viscosities can be \nassigned, \u03b70 and \u03b7\u221e, which relate to the low and high strain rate limits respectively. The Cross \nmodel then gives the viscosity as \n m\nK \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u22c5+\n\u2212+= \u221e\u221e .\n0\n1 \u03b3\n\u03b7\u03b7\u03b7\u03b7  (6), \nwhere m and K are empirical constants and \n.\u03b3  is strain rate (e.g. Barnes, 1999), with m \ncharacterising a stretching parameter for shear stress relaxation during the viscoelastic \ntransition. For a Maxwell body rheology, m=2. In the operational window of the oscillatory \nshear apparatus, only \u03b70 can be measured. The high strain rate viscosity, \u03b7\u221e,  is interpreted as \nthe effective viscosity of a fluid at high strain-rates or stresses.

The parallel plate viscometer uses shear rates of 10-5 to 10-7 s-1, compared with \nequivalents of ~10-2 to 102 s-1 for the torsion apparatus. The activation energy for viscous flow \nobtained by the dilatometer and torsion experiments (given by the gradient of the dashed lines \nin Fig. 10b) is ~950 \u00b1 5 kJ mol-1. The small offset (0.67 log units) between the two lines is \ndue to the effect of the volume (or bulk) viscosity of a porous sample, \u03b7v, which affects the \nparallel plate deformation results of the dilatometer experiments. The pure shear deformation \nused in the dilatometer gives a compressional viscosity, \u03b7c, which is usually related to the \nshear viscosity by \u03b7c\/3. However, this is valid only for incompressible samples (which have \nan infinite volume viscosity), and is therefore not applicable to material with ~50 % porosity, \nwhich will have a finite volume viscosity. For high porosity materials, the relationship \n svc \u03b7\u03b7\u03b7 34+=  (7) \nis appropriate (e.g. Bagdassarov and Dingwell, 1992). Thus measured values should be \ncorrected for a finite volume viscosity, the value of which is unknown. From Fig. 10b the \ncompressional viscosity data from the dilatometer experiments are related to the simple shear \nviscosity results of the torsion experiments, \u03b7s, by \u03b7c \u22483\u00d7100.67\u03b7s, or 101.15\u03b7s. Applying Eq. 7 \nthus gives \u03b7v \u2248 12.7\u03b7s (at ~50 % porosity).

The discrepancy between our result and this theoretical \nestimation may be easily attributed to experimental errors in viscositiy as well as the non-\nspherical shape of some vesicles and their non-uniform size distribution in the lava samples. \nAlternatives to the Cross model were reviewed by Yue and Br\u00fcckner (1994) who \nsuggested a strain rate dependent viscosity model depending on three phenomenological \nconstants. Their model is appropriate for parallel plate viscometry in which significant strain \nincreases during experiments can produce thermal effects and violations of non-slip boundary \nconditions. However, in the torsion experiments the maximum torque was 10-3 N m, and \nmaximum angle deformation 10-5 rad, resulting in a negligible heat production (<10-7 J s-1) \neven at the highest strain rates used. \nField measurements, corrected to unit strain rate, have reported significantly smaller \nshear viscosities for Hawaiian basalts. Shaw et al. (1968) measured plastic viscosities of 650 \nto 750 Pa s at 1130 \u00b0C and Pinkerton et al. (1995) measured viscosities of 234 to 548 Pa s at \n1146 \u00b0C (Fig. 8b). Unit shear rate results from the torsion experiments (as given by the fitted \nCross models) are five orders of magnitude greater than these field measurements. For Mount \nSt. Helens dacite, Pinkerton and Stevenson (1992) demonstrated that a combination of factors \nwas responsible for a 10 order of magnitude variation within measured and calculated \napparent viscosities at sub-liquidus temperatures. For Hawaiian basalt, although differences in \nvolatile content, crystallinity and vesicularity exist between the experimental and the \nfieldwork samples, the main difference in the results (Fig. 10b) is due to the magnitude of the \nstrain used, with rotational viscometry producing high strains and torsion and dilatometer \nexperiments producing small strains. \nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nDeleted: Theoretically, for \nDeleted: t\nDeleted: a \nDeleted: he \nDeleted: suspension of spherical \nvesicles \nDeleted: with a\nDeleted: of uniform size \nDeleted: distribution \nDeleted: the volume viscosity at \n50 \nDeleted: vol.\nDeleted: % \nDeleted: of \nDeleted: porosity is\nDeleted:  must be \u03b7v\nDeleted:  4\/3 (Prud'homme and \nBird, 1978)\u2026difference between \nour result and \nDeleted: from\nDeleted: th\nDeleted: e\nDeleted: is theoretical estimation \nmay be due to the uncertainty in \nthe small crystal content,\nDeleted: ,\nDeleted: and they\nDeleted:  Eq\u2026which \u2026to\u2026 the \nDeleted: ,\nDeleted: where\u2026significantly \n the\u2026.

In this case, the rheology is controlled by the \n\u201cstructure\u201d of the material and is consequently relatively high (see Fig. 10b, torsion and \ndilatometric experiments). For rotational viscometry (either in the field or in laboratory \nexperiments) the strains are much higher and, with time, the material \u201cstructure\u201d becomes \ndisrupted. The increasingly \u201cunstructured\u201d nature of the material results in a viscous shear \nthinning response (Barnes, 1997), producing decreased apparent viscosities. \nThe small stress and strain rate experiments carried out in torsion and dilatometer \nequipment demonstrate a second, relatively high viscosity (creep-type rheology), plateau in \nthe viscosity-strain rate dependence (Barnes, 1999) which cannot be observed with high stress \nor strain rate measurements. However, at temperatures above ~1145 to 1150 \u00b0C the \ngroundmass of lava becomes so fluid that the viscosity decreases a few orders of magnitude \n(Fig. 10b) and the high viscosity plateau is no longer present. Fig. 10b demonstrates the \ndifference between the \u03b7o  (creep-type) and \u03b7\u221e (viscoplastic) viscosities. In the small strain and \nsmall stress torsion equipment, the internal structure of lava sample is not destroyed, and the \nmeasured viscosity is of a creep-type. This type of viscosity may be expressed in lava dome \ngrowth or relaxation processes. In experiments with rotational viscometers where strains and \nstresses are considerable, the internal structure of the lava is destroyed and the apparent \nviscosity is several magnitudes smaller. This type of viscosity will control lava flows over \nsteep topography. Thus, at the same temperature, lavas may possess two viscosities depending \non a stress-strain scale and numerical modelling of lava flows should consider the high \nviscosity and viscoelasticity of lavas when strain rates are below unity. \n \nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nDeleted: 8b\nDeleted: In torsion experiments \nDeleted: in\nDeleted: between the low strain \nDeleted: lavas from one side\nDeleted: , and on the other, that \nDeleted: \u2019\nDeleted: i\nDeleted:  lava\nDeleted: , \nDeleted: from other side, \nDeleted: lies in the relative \nDeleted: Essentially\nDeleted: The\nDeleted: ,\nDeleted: presence of deformable \nDeleted: the \nDeleted: effective viscosity \nDeleted: decreaese\nDeleted: decreases at small \nDeleted: i\nDeleted: of\nDeleted: n\nDeleted:  the effective viscosity\nDeleted: increase\nDeleted: , but also\nDeleted: in the\nDeleted:  increases \nDeleted: of\nDeleted: the Bingham yield \nDeleted: \/\nDeleted: vesicles in Etna and \nDeleted: Vesuv \nDeleted: lavas increase the \nDeleted: which was observable \nDeleted:   \nDeleted: and shift\nDeleted: s\nDeleted: it toward smaller \nDeleted: values of \nDeleted: strain-rates which were \nDeleted: the operational window \nDeleted: our torsion experiments \nDeleted: ary\nDeleted: ast, the\nDeleted: in\nDeleted:  Hawai'i\nDeleted: \u2019ian\nDeleted:  lava sample, with a\nDeleted:  the\nDeleted: smaller\nDeleted: ratio of \n...

The oscillatory torsional apparatus allows low strain investigations of shear modulus and \ninternal friction. Experiments carried out on lavas over a range of temperatures (~500 to \n1150 \u00b0C) and frequencies (20 to 0.002 Hz) demonstrate that in general the complex shear \nmodulus of lavas decreases with decreasing frequency and increasing temperature. \nInternal friction is usually <1. \n2. At temperatures close to their eruption temperature (~1080 to 1100 \u00b0C) no purely viscous \nregime was detected for the Etna and Vesuvius samples and their measured creep-type \nviscosity remained frequency dependent over the range 20 to 0.002 Hz. However, results \nfor the Hawai'i sample indicate a shear rate independent regime for low shear rates at \ntemperatures between ~1070 and 1130 \u00b0C, with viscosities >109 Pa s. \n3. The samples from Etna and Vesuvius exhibited extended anelastic behaviour at \ntemperatures  within the \u201cglass transition\u201d temperature of the groundmass, and that may \nbe attributable to the bad cohesion between crystal grains and the groundmass glass. \nAnnealed lava at ~900 to 950\u00b0C possesses a shear modulus about 15 to 20 GPa. Below \n~800 \u00b0C, but still within basalt glass transition temperature range, when the dilatometric \neffect of between groundmass glass and crystals are significant, intensive microcracking \nmay be expected and can decrease the shear modulus to 7 to 10 GPa. By reheating \nbetween 700 and 950\u00b0C the characteristic time-constant of the lava hardening process \nmay be on a scale of several to a hundred hours.  \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank J.

In (b), the zero-shear \nviscosity values \u03b7o obtained for the Hawai'i lava sample are compared with those given by \ndilatometer (Bagdassarov, 2000) and rotational viscometer (Shaw, 1968, 1969; Ryerson et al., \n1988; Ryan and Blevins, 1974; Pinkerton et al. 1995) experiments on Hawai'ian basalt lavas. \nThere is good agreement between the dilatometer and the torsional results, with the slightly \ngreater values from the dilatometer being expected due to the effect of compression viscosity \non extracting shear viscosity values from the pure shear experiments (Bagdassarov and \nDingwell, 1992). The gradient of the dashed best fit lines represents an activation energy for \nviscous flow of ~950 kJ mol-1. The plot demonstrates the ~3 order of magnitude change in \nviscosity which occurs around 7.0\u00d710-4 K-1 (~1155 \u00b0C) and separates the high temperature, \nNewtonian region from the lower temperature, viscoplastic region. The 1 s-1 line indicates the \ntorsion results at unit shear rates which are more applicable for comparison with the rotational \nviscometer measurements. High values of \u03b7o obtained in torsion and dilatometer, small strain- \nstress experiments relate to the creep-type rheology displayed by lava when its internal \nstructure is not destroyed by the measurements. Field experiments carried out at high stresses \nand strains show \u03b7\u221e, or a viscoplastic viscosity, expressed when the internal structure (the \norganisation of vesicles and crystals) of the lava is altered by the viscometer or the flow itself.  \n \nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nFormatted\nDeleted: \u2019\nDeleted: Rocchi et al.\nDeleted: 2\nDeleted: \u2019\nDeleted: -\nDeleted: of lava samples with \nundestroyed  i\nDeleted: \u201c\nDeleted: \u201d\nDeleted: of crystals and vesicles. \nDeleted: being realised\nDeleted: .
