Introduction\nIn the field of BioMEMS there is an urgent need for new materials with customised \ntopographic and chemical properties.  The negative photoresist SU-8 has found a large \nnumber of attractive applications as a fundamental building material in the construction of \nvarious analytical tools (Shaw et al., 1997; Lorenz et al., 1998). SU-8 is extensively utilised \nin the design and manufacturing of micro- and nano- mechanical structures for MEMS and \nBioMEMS applications such as actuators and electrostatic sensors, biosensors, micromoulds, \nmicrofluidic devices or packing applications (Bashir, 2004; Ainslie and Desai, 2008).\nSU-8 which is a negative tone epoxy, based on the Epikote resin which, together with a \nphotoinitiator, is dissolved in an organic solvent. The cured layer of SU-8 forms a highly \ncross-linked matrix of covalent bonds, which results in a hard glass-like coating (Dellmann et \nal., 1998; Lee et al., 2003). This material constitutes a cost-effective solution for the \nproduction of fine-patterned, mechanical resistant structures for a variety of MEMS \napplications because of its compatibility with different types of standard X-ray and UV \nlithography techniques and with different coating processes (Cremers et al., 2001).\nIt is well established that SU-8 has been primarily used as a material for the construction of \nstructural elements and microfludics components in MEMS (Weisenberg and Mooradian, \n2002). BioMEMS applications require immobilisation of biomolecules on the MEMS \nstructures (Pan et al., 2004; Fichera et al., 2007; Jeykumari and Narayanan, 2008). \nIn order to functionalise SU-8 for such purposes, its surface requires to be modified. In the \npaper presented by Joshi et al. (2007a), the epoxy-groups of the SU-8 surface were \nhydrolysed in the presence of sulphochromic solution. Subsequently, the surface was treated \nwith [3-(2-aminoethyl) aminopropyl]-trimethoxysilane (AEAPS). The silanised SU-8 surface \nwas then utilised to incubate human immunoglobulin (HIgG). The immobilisation of HIgG \nwas proved by allowing FITC tagged goat anti-human IgG to react with HIgG. This antibody \nimmobilisation process was employed to immobilise HIgG on microfabricated SU-8 \ncantilevers.\nA dry method of surface modification of SU-8 was reported by Joshi et al. (2007b). The \nsurface obtained by spin coating SU-8 on a silicon wafer, was modified by grafting amine \ngroups using pyrolytic dissociation of ammonia in a hotwire CVD setup. Fourier transform \nPage 3 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\ninfrared spectroscopy was used to assess the presence of amine groups on the modified SU-8 \nsurface and also the surface characteristics after modification. SU-8 microcantilevers were \nfabricated and subjected to the same surface modification protocol in order to use the above \nprocess for application in BioMEMS. \nFabrication, characterisation and development of novel read-out methods using SU-8 \ncantilevers for bio\/chemical sensing have been demonstrated by Nordstrom et al. (2008). \nThey reported that SU-8 is an interesting polymer for fabrication of cantilevers for \nbio\/chemical sensing due to its simple processing and low Young\u2019s modulus. They \ndemonstrated examples of different integrated read-out methods and their characterisation. \nGlucose biosensors, both in vivo and in vitro, represent the largest biosensor market with \ncontinuing research and development efforts for further improvement. Nearly 90% of the\ncurrent biosensor market is accounted for by just one biosensor: the glucose biosensor (Reach \nand Wilson, 1992; Newman and Turner, 2005). The enzyme glucose oxidase which is chosen \nfor the present work is used abundantly in glucose sensing applications (Bankar et al., 2009). \nIt is relatively easy to test if it is still active e.g. by measuring oxygen consumption or the \nproduction of hydrogen peroxide. It is relatively stable and it is available at an affordable \nprice. The stability and activity of immobilised enzymes in confined carrier environments \ndepends on a number of factors such as whether the carrier is organic or inorganic, \nhydrophobic or hydrophilic, its chemical and mechanical stability, its porosity etc. \nA recent review describes enzyme immobilisation and the various considerations that are \ncrucial (Hanefeld et al., 2009). Enzymes can be immobilised in many different ways and \nimmobilisation methods include simple adsorption to surfaces (e.g. via hydrophobic \ninteraction or hydrogen bonding), immobilisation via ionic interaction, covalent binding to \nsolid supports, cross linking of enzymes, and encapsulation (e.g. in sol-gels). As carriers for \nenzyme immobilisation, polymeric membranes have been used extensively since they can \nhave various functional groups and be easily modified chemically (Abd El-Ghaffar and \nHashem, 2010; Kyprianou et al., 2009). The stability and activity of immobilised enzymes in \nconfined carrier environments depends on a number of factors such as whether the carrier is \norganic or inorganic, hydrophobic or hydrophilic, its chemical and mechanical stability, its \nporosity etc (Hanefeld et al., 2009). \nPage 4 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nPatel and his co-workers (2008) presented a self-aligned and hybrid polymer fabrication \nprocess for the development of an electro-enzymatic glucose sensor. The self-aligned \nfabrication process was performed using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a substrate \nmaterial, SU-8 as a sensor structural material, and gold as an electrode material. During \nmicrofabrication, SU-8 demonstrated good adhesion to the PDMS. This process was \nemployed to realise a glucose sensor with active and reference gold electrodes that were \nsandwiched between two SU-8 layers with contact pad openings and the active area opening \nto the top SU-8 layer. Glucose oxidase was immobilised within the confined active area \nopening in order to provide an active electrode sensing surface. \nThe literature survey reveals that SU-8 is one of the most promising materials with \nbiomedical and technological applications because of its biocompatibility, stability under \nvarying environmental conditions, and low cost. Although there has been a significant \nprogress in the research and development of processes involving utilisation of SU-8 in the \nlast three decades, there is no report of a successful attempt to investigate the performance \nand suitability of this highly researched polymer material to act as an immobilisation matrix \nfor entrapping biomolecules in the field of biosensors which would be of great importance for \ncost reduction and process simplification. Up to date, the use of SU-8 in BioMEMS \napplications is limited to surface modification of the polymer for immobilisation of \nbiomolecules and efforts of immobilisation of biomolecules entrapped inside and on the \nsurface of SU-8 matrix have not been reported in the current literature. This task is pursued \nsuccessfully in the present contribution and moreover the encapsulation of biomolecules is \ncarried out in parallel with the microfabrication process in a single step.\nIn the present paper the concept of developing a novel BioMEMS micro-biosensor using a \nsimple one-step mi rofabrication process of new polymer matrices with immobilised \nbiomolecules is investigated. More specifically, the study aims to investigate the suitability of \nthe widely used SU-8 polymer as a matrix for enzyme immobilisation carried out \nsimultaneously with the microfabrication process.  The ultimate objective could be the \nutilisation of the immobilised matrices for the development of an integrated low-cost \ndisposable glucose micro-biosensor.\nPage 5 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n2. Experimental\n2.1 Reagents\nThe chemicals used were obtained from the following providers: EponTM resin SU-8 granules \n(Hexion) was purchased from Miller Stephenson, Danbury., Connecticut 06810 USA \n(http:\/\/www.miller-stephenson.com); the solvent gamma-ButyroLactone (GBL), the \nphotoinitiator triarylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate salts, mixed 50% in propylene \ncarbonate, dextran clinical grade, average molecular weight 64,000-76,000, used as a solution \n5% w\/v in distilled water; glucose oxidase type X-S from Aspergillus niger, lyophilised \npowder, 100,000-250,000 units\/g solid, D-(+)-Glucose ACS reagent, and 1-methoxy-2-\npropyl-acetate (PGMEA) from Fluka, were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, \nSwitzerland. (http:\/\/sigmaaldrich.com).\nWater was de-ionized clean-room grade. Stock solutions of glucose were left to mutarotate at \nroom temperature for 24 hours before use, and were stored in a refrigerator. In all \nexperiments, the buffer solution used was phosphate buffer saline (PBS): 10mM Na2HPO4\/\nNaH2PO2, 154 mM NaCl, pH 7.2, all ACS grade from Merck\/VWR Nyon, Switzerland.\n2.2 Instrumentation\nFor exposure of the SU-8 films, an UV maskaligner (Karl Suss MA 6) was used \n(www.suss.com). Amperometric measurements were performed using the Autolab PGSTAT-\n12 potentiostat in combination with the software GPES (General Purpose Electrochemical \nSystem) Version 4.9 (Metrohm Autolab, Switzerland) (www.metrohm-autolab.com). \nScanning Electron Microscope images were obtained with an environmental scanning \nelectron microscope, model Philips XL30 ESEM-FEG. (FEI Company, Oregon, USA) \n(www.fei.com). A Wyko NT9000 series optical interferometric profiler (Veeco Co.) for film \napplications (Veeco Instruments Inc., Tucson, USA) (www.veeco.com). \n2.3 Preparation of \u201ccustomised\u201d SU-8 solutions\nThe SU-8 resist was prepared \u2018in-house\u2019 as the straightforward utilisation of the \ncommercially available SU-8 formulations was not a satisfactory route, the main reason being \nthat, the composition of the commercially available SU-8 is not provided and therefore \ncannot be fine tuned for the demanding application under investigation.   \nThe \u201ccustomised\u201d SU-8 resist was prepared by dissolving the Epon SU-8 granules in gamma-\nbutyrolactone (GBL), and adding the photo-initiator triarylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate \nPage 6 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nsalts. Preparation of the \u201ccustomised\u201d SU-8 resist has been described in detail in earlier \npublications (Psoma and Jenkins 2005; Psoma et al., 2006) with some adjustments to the new \napplication. In all experiments, the composition was 40% SU-8 and 60% solvent (40\/60) with \n2.5% of UV photoinitiator.\nThe procedure for producing 100 mL of base solution (40\/60) is briefly described as follows: \nFirstly, the SU-8 granules were smashed to a very fine powder (40 g), which was then mixed \nwith GBL solvent (57.5 g) and sonicated for 1 h. Although optically clear it was found \nnecessary to leave the solution on a chemical shaker with smooth movements at 37\u00b0C for 96 \nhours. The solution was stored at room temperature for at least two weeks to mature and the \ncrystals of the SU-8 granules to be fully dissolved. Before use, an amount of 2.5 g of the \nphotoinitiator was added to the solution and sonicated for one hour.\n2.4 Microfabrication process of the SU-8 films\nSilicon wafers were cleaned and de-hydrated according to standard clean-room protocol. The \nwafers were covered with a sacrificial layer of dextran by spin-coating a 5% w\/v solution in \ndistilled water on its surface. This sacrificial layer can be dissolved in water for easy release \nof the SU-8 structures (Linder et al, 2005). \nThe standard microfabrication process steps for SU-8 resist with enzyme formulations were \nas follows: 4 mL of the SU-8 mixture was spin-coated on a wafer with a starting spin speed \nof 500 rpm for 5 seconds and then the speed was increased to 1000 rpm for 30 seconds (the \nspeed was adjusted in some cases, see discussion). The layers were allowed to relax for 15 \nminutes before soft-bake. The soft-bake step, was implemented using a programmable \nramping hotplate, the temperature was slowly increased from room temperature to 65oC, \nwhere it was kept for 30 minutes; and then was allowed to decrease slowly back to room \ntemperature. Subsequently, the resist film was exposed (250mJ\/cm2) with a standard UV \naligner (Karl Suss MA6) using a quartz mask. The design of the mask was selected to be a \nrepeated pattern of a simple rectangular shape with dimensions of 5 mm x 4 mm. After \nexposure, a post-bake step was performed. This followed the same procedure as the soft-\nbake. Finally, the wafers were developed in PGMEA (approximately 60 sec) and rinsed with \nisopropanol, followed by distilled water and were dried using a flow of nitrogen. \nPage 7 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nAfter processing, the resulted SU-8 films were highly transparent, without any evidence of \ncracks with an approximate thickness of 5.4 \u03bcm. Eventually, the structures were released in \ndistilled water, then collected and stored in 10mM phosphate buffer solution at a temperature \nof 5 \u00b0C.\n2.5 Enzyme immobilisation in SU-8 films\nFor the experiments which required the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) immobilisation in the \nbulk SU-8 films, the same microfabrication process as described in the previous section was \nfollowed, with the main difference being in the composition of the SU-8 solution. More \nspecifically, the glucose oxidase solution was added to the \u201ccustomised\u201d SU-8 solution \n(4mL) and was shaken gently trying to avoid generation of bubbles before the spin-coating \nstep. \nThe enzyme was dissolved in a 10mM phosphate buffer solution pH 7.2. The standard \nenzyme added quantity was 10 mg of glucose oxidase (141,200 units\/g) dissolved in PBS. \nAlso different concentrations were prepared by adding 5mg and 20mg of glucose oxidase in \n4mL SU-8 solution in order to investigate the influence it has on signal quantity. During the \nexperimental work, all SU-8 films were stored in 10 mM PBS solution at 5 \u00b0C and before use \nthey were left to reach room temperature.\n2.6 Electrochemical measurements\nIn a first series of experiments, 40 mL of PBS was introduced in a thermostatted titration \nvessel (Metrohm 6.1418.110); a number of SU-8 platelets were added, ensuring that they \nremained in the proximity of the bottom of the vessel. Electrochemical measurements were \nperformed using a 3-electrode setup with platinum working and counter electrode (Metrohm \n6.0301.100, resp. 6.305.100) and an Ag\/AgCl reference electrode (Metrohm 6.0733.100). The \nworking electrode was polarised at +650 mV with respect to the reference electrode.  After \napproximately 10 to 15 minutes the current had stabilised and increments of 1 M glucose in \nPBS were added to the solution.\nA second series of tests were performed in the same thermostatted vessel at 37\u00b0C, in this case \nwith only 500 \u03bcL of PBS solution and only one platelet of SU-8 (special care had to be taken \nin order not to float). The vessel was equipped with a small stirrer bar. A home-made 3 \nelectrode cell was immersed in the electrolyte. The cell consisted of a double sided Kapton \nPage 8 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nsubstrate with 3 electrodes. The total length of the substrate is 23 mm, to the contact pads of \nthe upper part, wires were soldered for further connecting, the electrodes are located at the tip \n(last mm) of the long lower part (16 mm long and 125 \u03bcm wide). The original metal lines \nwere made of gilded copper, passivated with Kapton, platinum was electrodeposited on all 3 \nelectrodes in a post process and the reference electrode was additionally coated with Ag\/AgCl \nby a galvanostatic method. The dimensions of the working electrode were approximately 300 \n\u00d7 50 \u03bcm.  The working electrode was polarised at +650 mV vs. the on-chip  Ag\/AgCl pseudo-\nreference electrode. Measurement was performed under constant stirring with intermittent \nstopping of the stirrer.\n3. Results and discussions\nEnzyme loaded SU-8 structures were prepared on wafer as described in the experimental \npart; rectangular platelets with dimensions of 5mm x 4mm were released by dissolving the \nsacrificial dextran layer and stored in PBS solutions at 4\u00baC. This shape was quite easy to be \nlifted from the wafer using a sacrificial layer of dextran solution. A quartz mask with a \npattern of 84 rectangular shapes with the aforementioned dimensions was utilised. Standard \nconditions consisted of a loading 10 mg of GOx in a 4 mL formulation of SU-8, and a \nspinning speed of 1000 rpm.  These standard conditions resulted in platelets with a thickness \nof 5+2 \u00b5m. Different spinning speeds and concentrations were investigated. When discussing \nthe SU-8 films below, unless stated otherwise, the films resulting from the standard \nconditions are referred to. Different spinning speeds would result in different thicknesses of \nthe films.\n3.1 Surface characterisation of SU-8 films\nA comparison of SU-8 films with and without enzyme with an optical microscope reveals \nthat the plain SU-8 films have a smooth surface and show interference rings visible with the \nnaked eye, while enzyme containing layers are much rougher. The clusters of enzyme can be \nclearly observed. Similar images were taken with an optical interferometer and they are \npresented in Figure 1. Figure 1(a) and (b) illustrate a plain SU-8 film showing a roughness \nvariation in the nanometer range. Figure 1(a) is the 3-D image of a plain SU-8 film and \nFigure 1(b) is a planar image of the same film. In Figure 1(c) and (d), images show a cluster \nof enzyme; the central red-coloured region of the surface is elevated by a few micrometers. In \nthis figure the elevation is 2.5 \u00b5m, in other pictures (not shown) this was up to 4 \u00b5m. This \npattern was found to be more or less uniformly distributed on the whole scanned surface and \nPage 9 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nwas not present in the plain SU-8 films, where the mean elevation varied in the range of few \nnanometers.\nFIGURE 1\nIn Figure 2 surface images obtained with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) are \nillustrated. Figure 2(a) shows a plain SU-8 film, Figure 2(b) a film with immobilized enzyme. \nThe plain SU-8 film presents a very uniform, clear and smooth surface. Actually, the spot in \nthe picture is a speck of dirt used for focusing. From a careful observation of the film with \nenzyme, it can be found that clusters of enzyme molecules are formed on the film\u2019s surface \nwhereas the remaining surface remains uninterrupted and uniform. This observation agrees \nwith the patterns identified in the scan images from the optical interferometer. The presence \nof the clusters of GOx molecules modifies the surface morphology as it is apparent in Figure \n1b. The reported diameter size of GOx molecules in the literature is in the region of 8 to \n15nm (Lvov et al., 1996; Ram et al., 2000). It has to be mentioned that the SU-8 films, with \nloaded enzyme or without enzyme, were stored in a PBS buffer solution and were well-\nwashed in double distilled water before taking the SEM images, thus removing the PBS salts \nfrom the samples. The clusters shown on the film surface of  Figure 2 have rounded-like \nshapes and could not be from remaining salt of the PBS solution, as salt grains look like \nbroken and\/or deformed cubes. Consequently, the observed surface irregularities are clearly \nfrom clusters of enzyme molecules. \nFIGURE 2\n3.2 Amperometric measurements of SU-8 films with immobilised enzyme\nIn order to assess whether the immobilised enzyme remained active inside the SU-8 matrix, \nan experimental investigation was carried out using an electrochemical method \n(amperometric detection of hydrogen peroxide) to quantify the activity of the enzyme. The \nmost widely used method for detecting and measuring glucose in biosensor applications is the \nPage 10 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nenzymatic oxidation of glucose in the presence of oxygen which produces gluconic acid and \nhydrogen peroxide. In order to define the glucose concentration, the used methods usually \nmeasure the oxygen consumption or the production of either hydrogen peroxide or gluconic \nacid which is related to pH changes. In the present study, the above reaction was utilised to \ndetect different levels of glucose concentration in a solution through the further oxidation of \nthe produced hydrogen peroxide and the measurement of the associated current. \nConsequently, the present method is an indirect method of glucose measurement.\nHydrogen peroxide can be measured amperometrically (see Section 2.6 for details). Two \nseries of experiments were carried out with different glass cells used in the experimental \nsetup. In general, the experimental setup consisted of a measurement glass cell, the electrodes \nand the computerised data acquisition system. Subsequently, the viability of the enzyme was \ntested by measuring its ability to produce hydrogen peroxide upon exposure to glucose. \nIn a first series of tests, a platinum wire working electrode was brought into contact with a \nplatelet in a volume of 40 mL of electrolyte, with a counter and reference electrode located \nfurther on in the electrolyte. SU-8 films without enzyme were used as reference at the outset \nand they showed negligible variation in the observed current during the addition of glucose in \nthe measurement cell  which occurred at a time of approximately 625 seconds  after the \ninitiation of the experiment (Figure 3(a)). In addition, standard SU-8 platelets with GOx \nimmobilised were placed close at the bottom of a glass cell. Approximately 20 to 25 minutes \nafter initiating the measurement, the current had stabilised and 40 \u00b5l of a 1 M glucose \nsolution was added to the buffer solution. The signal was immediately increased and \nstabilised after a few minutes. Subsequent additions showed an increase in the signal. In \nFigure 3(b) an example of a raw measurement graph is presented. It has to be mentioned that \nthe solution was not stirred during this experiment and consequently the exact concentration \nis not known. In a proof of principle, the electrode was retracted from the surface of the \nplatelets, during which the signal decreased to virtually zero current at large distance and \nincreased upon re-approaching the platelets.\nFIGURE 3\nPage 11 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nA second series of experiments were carried out under more controlled conditions in a 500 \u03bcL\nvolume of PBS in a titration vessel fitted with a small stirrer bar. One platelet was placed into \nthe solution and measurements were taken with a custom made miniaturised 3 electrode cell: \na platinum working and counter, and an Ag\/AgCl pseudo-reference electrode. Measurements \nwere performed under constant stirring with intermittent stopping of the stirrer. After 5-10 \nminutes a stable current was established and 5 \u03bcL of a 1 M glucose solution was added, \nresulting in a concentration of approximately 10 mM. In case of the enzyme containing \nplatelets, a continuously increasing current was observed. The increase showed a constant \nslope, during the duration of the measurements (2 hours). Obviously the enzyme is \ncontinuously producing hydrogen peroxide that is accumulated in the solution. As \nmeasurements are dependent upon stirring speed, stirring was stopped with 6 minute intervals \nfor 2 minutes for taking stir-independent measurements. The signal was found to decrease \nand stabilise during these 2 minutes intervals. Re-starting of the stirrer (same speed as before) \nresulted in a signal that could be extrapolated without the turning off of the stirrer.\nFIGURE 4\nWhen films with encapsulated enzyme were utilised, a very clear increase in current was \nobserved when glucose was introduced in the solution. The response was very fast (a few \nseconds) and also the signal was found to be proportional to the added glucose quantity. In \nFigure 4, the variation of current with time is presented. The step rise in current is apparent \nwhen glucose is added to the solution at certain times. The same film was tested again one \nweek later and showed similar behaviour proving that the enzyme remains active inside the \nSU-8 matrix. Similar results were acquired two months later. This long term stability \nindicates that the entrapment of the enzyme inside the SU-8 matrix does not deactivate or \ndestroy the enzyme, and this can be attributed to the crosslink bonding of the amino groups in \nSU-8 and in glucose oxidase. In addition, the capability of glucose molecules to reach the \nenzyme indicates porosity in the matrix, but not signs of leakage for the enzyme. Up to date \nthere are not similar data in the literature for the SU-8 matrix to further support the above \nfinding.  \nPage 12 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nA different set of experiments were also carried out, using films with immobilised enzyme, of \nthe same standard dimensions but of two different average thicknesses equal to \napproximately 6 \u03bcm and 9 \u03bcm. All other remaining parameters of the microfabrication \nprocess remained unchanged. Figure 5 presents the current variation with time where it is \nobvious that there is an increase in the current in response to one addition of the same glucose \nquantity (10 mM) in the solution. \nFIGURE 5\nIn addition, it was observed that the process becomes slower as the film thickness increases, \nwhich indicates that the encapsulated enzyme in the interior matrix of the film also plays a \nsignificant role in the process as the reaction products (hydrogen peroxide) inside the SU-8 \nmatrix move more slowly towards the surface and in the outer region. However, additional \nexperiments need to be carried out in order to define the exact correlation between film \nthickness and response time as the current experimental setup is not appropriate to perform \nsuch an investigation. \nThis experimental analysis step proved that the enzyme remains active not only on the \nsurface but also inside the matrix of the SU-8 microfabricated films and the process steps that \nwere followed during the manufacturing process did not deactivate it. Nevertheless, a limited \ninfluence on its activity is expected, but it is extremely difficult to be quantified. \nAdditional experiments need to be carried out to address the effect of the manufacturing \nprocess have on enzyme activity, in case of the described application needs to move beyond \nthe proof-of-principal stage. Such experiments can investigate the effect of different organic \nsolvents, pre-bake and post-bake temperatures, exposure time, porosity of SU-8 matrix etc on \nenzyme activity and stability.\n4. Conclusions\nThe suitability of the SU-8 polymer as a biocompatible matrix capable of encapsulating \nbiomolecules such as enzymes was proven through the encapsulation of the enzyme GOx in \nthe SU-8 solution. The electrochemical measurements showed that the entrapped enzyme \nPage 13 of 20\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nremained active after the micro-fabrication process. A novel aspect of the present work is that \nthe immobilisation is carried out in parallel with the microfabrication process and not \nafterwards as a surface modification process. \nA detailed investigation was carried out using an electrochemical method in order to check \nthe activity of the enzyme. Testing of immobilised enzyme activity inside the SU-8 matrix \nwas carried out using amperometric detection of hydrogen peroxide in a 3-electrode setup. \nSU-8 films were immersed in buffer solutions and the platinum working electrode was \nbrought in close contact with the film. Films without enzyme showed negligible variation in \ncurrent during the addition of glucose, whereas when films with encapsulated enzyme were \nutilised, a very clear increase in current was consistently observed when glucose was \nintroduced. A significant conclusion from this experiment is that the enzyme remains active \nnot only on the film\u2019s surface but inside the matrix as well. A possible explanation could be \nthat the SU-8 film is likely to be porous allowing glucose to diffuse to the interior and \napproach the immobilised enzyme where oxidation occurs. In addition, hydrogen peroxide is \nreleased and diffuses to the surrounding aqueous environment where they are detected with \nthe platinum electrode which is in close proximity to the film surface. A test which was \ncarried out two months after production of the SU-8 films showed that the enzyme \nmaintained similar levels of activity with the first test which took place the first day.\nThe proposed sensing method can be used in combination with an electrochemical \nmeasurement technique and can be combined with the infrastructure of an already existing \nelectrochemical sensor. The integration of the developed glucose micro-biosensor offers a \npromising first step for the integration with organic electronics (organic LED and \nphotodetectors) in order to produce an integrated system which can be micromanufactured in \nthe same polymer matrix and can form a basis for the development of the next generation \nBioMEMS biosensors.\nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) for the \nfinancial support of the experimental work of this project (Individual International Exchange \nProgramme \u2013 Project Reference.: IZK0Z2-124260).
