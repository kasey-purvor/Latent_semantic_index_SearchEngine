INTRODUCTION\nExcimer laser sELd crystallization has been the preferred\nmethod for polycrystalline thin-film formation for thin-film\ntransistor sTFTd applications.1\u20133 The technology has evolved\nover the past 20 years, with an extensive array of literature.\nMost of the research has focused on improving the mobility\nof hydrogenated amorphous silicon sa-Si:Hd by crystalliza-\ntion into polycrystalline silicon. Pulsed laser energy melts\nand solidifies thin a-Si:H films within nanosecond time\nscales, systematically evolving hydrogen and forming poly-\ncrystalline silicon. The short-wavelength, short pulse dura-\ntion ultraviolet sUVd energy of the EL is absorbed into the\na-Si:H within a few nanometers, with a minimum percentage\nof heat reaching the substrate. This enables the use of cheap\nsubstrates such as glass that cannot withstand conventional\nannealing temperatures for large area electronic applications.\nAlthough the application has primarily been focused on\nTFTs, its adaptability for photovoltaics sPVd has attracted\nconsiderable interest.4\u20137\nThe physics of EL crystallization has been well\nestablished.8\u201312 Two major streams of EL crystallization are\nreported, multiple pulse based and single pulse based.2 The\nmultiple pulses based scanning method is considered to be\nthe conventional approach.13 With the advent of high power\nexcimer lasers, the single pulse scheme has become an at-\ntractive alternative, due to its ability to crystallize a large\narea with a single pulse.14\nA laser threshold energy density exists for the conver-\nsion of a-Si:H to polycrystalline silicon, corresponding to the\nthreshold intensity for surface melting.1 Films start to melt\nafter this energy density, with the melt depth increasing with\nincrease of energy density. Three basic transformation sce-\nnarios have been reported during the EL treatment. These are\ncategorized according to the melt depth as partial melting,\ncomplete melting, and near complete melting regimes.2 Par-\ntial melting occurs when the laser energy density is low, but\nsufficient to melt a layer of the film leaving a continuous\nsolid layer underneath. This regime results in a stratified\nstructure with large crystallites at the irradiating surface, fol-\nlowed by a fine-grained silicon layer. The underlying layer is\nexpected to be amorphous, but its properties may be affected\ndue to heat transfer. Although the resultant silicon is com-\nmonly known as polycrystalline silicon, the crystallites\nformed are in nanometer range and hence in this work, the\nterm \u2018nano-polycrystalline\u2019 silicon is used to designate films\ncrystallized by the partial melting regime. In the complete\nmelting regime, the deeply supercooled melt increases nucle-\nation rate causing a spontaneous nucleation process. The re-\nsulting films have a fine-grained crystalline structure.2,15\nBetween the two major regimes, another regime exists\nwith very important characteristics. It was argued that, just\nbefore the complete melt, the unnmelted portion of the un-\nderlying silicon consists of islands of solids instead of a con-\ntinuous layer. These unmelted solids separated by small local\nregions of completely melted silicon act as seed layers for\nlateral growth.2 This behavior at the critical point of com-\nplete melting has given the name \u2018near complete melting\nregime\u2019 to this scheme. The lateral growth results in very\nlarge grain sizes, a few times that of the film thickness.9 The\nability of excimer lasers to crystallize a very thin layer of\na-Si:H in the order of 100 nm1 becomes a limitation for\nphotovoltaics, since films of the order of 1 mm are necessary\nfor adequate light absorption.16 Although films of 200-nm-\nthick a-Si:H, with low hydrogen concentrations deposited by\nlow-pressure chemical vapor deposition17 have been reported\nto be crystallized by EL, due to high absorption properties of\na-Si:H at UV, the attainable polysilicon thickness is inad-\nequate for solar cell applications. The indirect band gap of\ncrystalline silicon requires thicker films compared to a-Si:H.\nadAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nd.adikaari@surrey.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 97, 114305 s2005d\n0021-8979\/2005\/97~11!\/114305\/7\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics97, 114305-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

In this investigation, 100, 300, and 500 nm thick\nfilms were irradiated with a set of laser energy densities, and\nwere characterized for structural and electrical properties.\nThe experiment falls into the partial melting regime, result-\ning in layered structures. Raman spectroscopy was utilized to\ninvestigate the structural characteristics of samples. Optical\nabsorption measurements were used for optical characteriza-\ntion and will be discussed along with the results obtained\nfrom hydrogen quantification. Atomic force microscopy\nsAFMd was used for surface analysis and the surface rough-\nness effects will be discussed as a potential light trapping\nmechanism. Dark conductivities were calculated from\ncurrent\u2013voltage measurements. The discussion addresses\nthickness dependence of these parameters in the context of\nPV.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\na-Si:H films were deposited by plasma enhanced chemi-\ncal vapor deposition sPECVDd. 100 nm thick samples were\ndeposited on 0.7 mm thick Corning 1737 glass covered with\na PECVD grown 100 nm silicon nitride layer followed by a\n400 nm silicon dioxide sSiO2d layer. The 300 and 500 nm\nthick samples were deposited without the silicon dioxide\nlayer. All samples were intrinsic snot intentionally dopedd\nand deposited at 250 \u00b0C. The samples will be referred to as\n100, 300, and 500 nm samples in the text.\nA KrF Lambda Physik excimer laser sLPX 210id operat-\ning at 248 nm with a 25 ns full width half maximum pulse\nduration was used for irradiations. A set of attenuators is\nused as a secondary control of laser energy density, and a set\nof optics located outside the LPX 210i guides the beam to\nthe irradiating chamber. The beam is homogenized using a\nMicrolas beam homogenizer to obtain a semi-Gaussian pro-\nfile and the profile is captured by an Exitech Profile 256\nsystem, for the analysis of the energy distribution. The\nsamples are placed in a vacuum chamber fixed on a micron\nprecise translation stage for scanning the film in order to\nyield large area crystallization. The laser energy is measured\nusing a Molectron EPM 1000 analyzer and a detector. The\nactual experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The scanning\nspeed of the films was 2.5 mm\/s with a pulse repetition rate\nof 50 Hz. The films were scanned with a 4 mm wide pulse\nalong the 10 mm long Gaussian direction with an overlap of\n5% between two scan lines. This arrangement results in a\n\u2018multiple pulse irradiation\u2019 scheme with a pulse density of\n200 at a given spot. A series of laser energy densities was\nused for the crystallization from 50 to 300 mJ cm\u22122, in steps\nof 50 mJ cm\u22122. 300 mJ cm\u22122 was the maximum energy den-\nsity uniformly attainable, due to constraints associated with\nthe experimental setup. The laser energy densities are quoted\nfor a single pulse. The pulse-to-pulse variation of modern\nexcimer lasers is reported to be 6%\u20139%, hence the laser en-\nergy densities are expected to have an error of at least 10%.18\nOptical transmission measurements of the samples were\ndone with a Camspec M330 UV-visible spectrophotometer\nand Raman spectroscopy with a Renishaw 2000 Raman mi-\ncroscope with a 782-nm excitation. Elastic forward recoil\nspectrometry sFRSd was performed using a 2-MV Tandetron\naccelerator and customized IBA Data Furnace software for\nthe quantification of hydrogen in the resulting films. Surface\nroughnesses of the samples were estimated using atomic\nforce microscopy. A Digital Instruments, Dimension 3100\nscanning probe microscope was used in AFM mode for mea-\nsurements. Room-temperature, current-voltage measure-\nments of the samples were done using a coplanar electrode\nconfiguration with a Keithley 487 picoammeter\/voltage\nsource.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Raman spectroscopy\nIt has been observed that the resulting microstructure of\nEL-treated a-Si:H gives rise to partial melting and thereby\nresults in a stratified structure.2 The stratified microstructure\nof EL crystallized silicon thin films makes it difficult to es-\ntimate the investigation depth of samples from Raman mi-\ncroscopy. However, with the film depths under discussion,\nwhich are less than a micron, Raman spectra are expected to\ncontain information for the complete layer.\nThe Raman spectrum of mixed phase silicon has two\ndistinct peaks corresponding to an amorphous phase and\ncrystalline phase. For crystalline silicon, momentum conser-\nFIG. 1. Excimer laser crystallization\nexperimental setup.\n114305-2 A. Adikaari and S. Silva J. Appl. Phys. 97, 114305 ~2005!\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

In mixed\nphase silicon, the momentum selection rule of the Raman\nprocess is more relaxed compared to crystalline silicon. With\nincreasing momentum the TO phonon energy lowers, leading\nto broadening of the Raman peak towards the lower\nenergies.19,20\nFigure 2 shows the Raman spectra for 500 nm samples,\ncrystallized with different laser energy densities. Evidence of\na crystalline phase starts to show after an energy density of\n100 mJ cm\u22122. A clear trend of increasing crystallinity is ob-\nserved as expected from the EL crystallization. The wide TO\npeak of a-Si:H is evident in almost all the films investigated,\nwith decreasing intensities. The crystalline peak becomes\nsharp after 250 mJ cm\u22122 for 500 nm films. However, the\npeak occurs at 518 cm\u22121, which is lower by a few wave\nnumbers than the number observed for monocrystalline sili-\ncon. This observation has been attributed to phonon\nconfinement,21 possibly due to the presence of nanocrystals\nembedded in a-Si:H environment. Stress-induced effects are\nalso reported to cause this behavior.21\nSimilar trends are observed for 100 and 300 nm samples.\nThe crystalline peak becomes increasingly prominent with\nthinner samples, due to melting and resolidification of the\ncomparatively higher volume of film. The crystalline volume\nfractions of samples were calculated from the integrated in-\ntensities of the Raman peaks, with Gaussian fits for the\namorphous peak sIad and Lorentzian fits for the crystalline\npeaks sIcd. The calculation was done as proposed by Tsu et\nal. with crystalline volume fraction sXcd given by Eq. s1d,\nwhere g is the ratio of the backscattering cross-sections\namorphous and crystalline phases,22\nXc =\nIc\nIc + sgdIa\n. s1d\nThe selection of a value for g is complex due to its depen-\ndency on absorption coefficient of amorphous and crystalline\nsilicon.23 Different energy densities result in different grain\nsizes, which further complicates the analysis, since the ab-\nsorption coefficient changes too.24 g has been calculated to\nbe between 0.8 and 0.9, the most widely used value being 0.8\nfor mixed phase silicon, especially for excimer laser crystal-\nlized silicon.23,25,26 For this analysis too, g was taken to be\n0.8. Figure 3 shows the Xc variation of all three sets of films\nwith laser energy density.\nRoom-temperature thermal conductivities of Corning\n1737 glass s0.91 Wm\u22121 K\u22121d,27 a-Si:H s1.0 Wm\u22121 K\u22121d,28\nand SiO2s1.0 Wm\u22121 K\u22121d29 grown by PECVD are compa-\nrable to silicon nitride s0.8 Wm\u22121 K\u22121d29 grown by PECVD,\nbased on the film thickness and varies with temperature and\nfollows a similar trend. Hence, it is proposed that solidifica-\ntion velocities of the samples under discussion are similar,\nprovided that the at. % of hydrogen in the films are the same.\nA clear trend of increasing crystalline volume with increase\nof laser energy density is observed. The 100 nm film shows\nthe highest Xc, at 250 mJ cm\u22122. The highest energy density,\n300 mJ cm\u22122, was not used on this sample since significant\nmass transfer was evident at 250 mJ cm\u22122. The 300 and 500\nnm samples also show the increasing trend, however, with\nlower Xc, due to the inadequacy of the laser energy to com-\npletely melt the films through the entire thickness. This tech-\nnique yields a rough estimate of Xc, and the Raman spectra\nitself is evident for the nanocrystallites embedded in the film.\nHowever, accurate information with regard to grain size and\nits distribution cannot be extracted from Raman spectroscopy\nalone, due to the stratified nature of the films.\nThe amorphous fraction in the resultant films is postu-\nlated as arising from any remaining unconverted a-Si:H and\ngrain boundaries. From these observations, it can be stated\nthat to crystallize films thicker than 300 nm, very high en-\nergy densities over 300 mJ cm\u22122 are necessary. However, ex-\nperiments show that higher energy densities result in in-\ncreased surface roughness, possibly due to explosive\nevaporation of hydrogen, ablating the surface. Use of longer\nwavelength ELs, which will have a longer absorption depth\ninto the films, will be a possible solution to overcome this\nproblem.30\nThe utilization of \u2018large-grained\/fine-grained\/amorph\nous\u2019 layered silicon structure from EL crystallization as the\nabsorber layer, instead of conventional homogeneous a-Si:H\nFIG. 2.

Optical absorption\nOptical absorption of the samples was used to estimate\nthe optical gap using Tauc\u2019s method. Measurements were\nperformed at a near normal incidence from 190 to 900 nm\nwavelength range. For the extraction of the optical gap, sev-\neral models have been proposed for amorphous semiconduc-\ntors. However, Tauc\u2019s method has been the most preferred\ntechnique, compared to the models of Cody and Klazes.31\nAccording to Tauc, if the band edges are parabolic, with\nconstant momentum matrix elements, the optical gap can be\nfound by the relationship given in Eq. s2d,\n\u02dbahy = Atshy \u2212 Egd . s2d\nDue to the layered structures of the substrates, the effect of\nreflections on the optical transmission spectra has a signifi-\ncant influence on calculations. The multiple internal reflec-\ntions were disregarded for this analysis, with the assumption\nthat the effect is small near the medium absorption region.\nThe data was corrected for reflections using a simplified\nmodel as suggested by Nitta et al.32\nFigure 4 shows the extracted optical gaps of all three sets\nof films from Tauc\u2019s method. A direct correlation cannot be\nclearly seen between the three sets of samples. Theoretical\nanalysis on mixed phase silicon suggests a gradual decrease\nof the Tauc gap with increasing Xc.\n33 A contradictory obser-\nvation is made in the case of 100 nm samples, where the\noptical gap seems to increase considerably between 150 and\n200 mJ cm\u22122. The same phenomenon can be seen with\n300-nm samples, although less significantly. 500 nm samples\nonly show a very slow gradual reduction of Tauc gap. This\nphenomenon is proposed to be mainly due to critical compo-\nsitions of hydrogen in the films, which enhances the reces-\nsion of valence band of a-Si:H\/nanocrystalline silicon. Von\nRoedern et al. showed that this recession can be as high as 1\neV for amorphous silicon.34 The variation of the optical gap\nof a-Si:H depending on H content shows similar\ncharacteristics.28 Also, quantum confinement effects due to\nthe fine-grained nanocrystalline silicon layer could enhance\nthis phenomenon. The effect is reported in detail elsewhere.35\nThe effect is less evident in the 300 nm samples, and not\nrelevant to the 500 nm samples with the discussed energy\ndensities, due to the inadequacy of laser energy to melt films\nup to the critical depth, which in turn affects retained hydro-\ngen in the films. It is suggested that results similar to those\nobserved for 100 nm films can be obtained for thicker films,\nusing excimer laser energy densities greater than\n300 mJ cm\u22122. However, it is also speculated that, due to the\nhigher volumes of material involved in this case, the effect\nmay not be as prominent as the 100 nm samples. Since the\nfilms are not completely converted to crystalline silicon, the\nestimated Tauc gap is influenced by the different optical\nproperties of each layer of resulting silicon. For PV applica-\ntions, this could be a useful property, since the resulting ma-\nterial can absorb a range of photon energies. However, the\ncomplexities involved in transport and collection of excited\ncarriers will have to be dealt with for possible exploitation of\nthese characteristics.\nC. Dehydrogenation\nDehydrogenation occurs as a result of EL crystallization\nsince the Si\u2013H s3.4 eVd28 bonds are broken by the energy\nabsorbed from the EL photon s5.1 eVd. Released hydrogen\nevaporates from the silicon melt, causing surface\nroughness.36 Different techniques have been utilized for con-\ntrolled evolution of hydrogen. Gaussian beam profiles used\nfor these experiments are reported to be an efficient means of\nsystematic evolution of hydrogen, due to the lower-energy\npreceding edge.37 Figure 5 shows the atomic percentages of\nhydrogen sH at. %d in the samples as a function of laser\nenergy density obtained using FRS.\nH at. % of initial a-Si:H was 9.5, 8.5, and 10.5, respec-\ntively, for 100, 300, and 500 nm samples. The small variation\nof initial hydrogen is expected due to different deposition\nruns. The 100 nm samples show an almost linear dehydroge-\nnation pattern, removing almost all the hydrogen from the\nsample at 250 mJ cm\u22122. The FRS results for 300 and 500 nm\nsamples suggest at a glance that hydrogen evolution starts\nFIG. 4. Optical gap of 100, 300, and 500 nm samples calculated using\nTauc\u2019s method.\nFIG. 5. Hydrogen atomic percentage of 100, 300, and 500 nm samples\nanalyzed by FRS. For 300 and 500 nm thick samples, the H percentage\nshown is relevant only to dehydrogenated layer, which is shown in Fig. 6.\n114305-4 A. Adikaari and S. Silva J. Appl. Phys. 97, 114305 ~2005!\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

However, a careful investigation of the\nFRS analysis shows two distinct layers of film with different\nhydrogen contents after irradiation above 100 mJ cm\u22122. The\ntrend shown in Fig. 5 corresponds to the top layer, whereas\nthe H at. % of the second layer does not change. The depth\nof the top layer increases with laser energy density, as shown\nin Fig. 6. These dehydrogenated depths are similar for both\n300 and 500 nm films, confirming that the crystallization\nenvironment and mechanism are similar for both sets of films\nand therefore thickness independent to an extent.\nSince hydrogen has a significant influence on the elec-\ntronic properties of a-Si:H, these stratified structures from\nthe EL crystallization have complex electronic properties,\nwhere they are governed by different mechanisms. If the\neffects of heat reaching the unconverted a-Si:H are disre-\ngarded, which has not been confirmed, electronic properties\nof this layer is most likely to be similar to the initial a-Si:H.\nHowever, the large-grained layer at the surface has a very\nhigh Xc and its properties will be governed by the ordered\ncrystal structure, apart from the contribution of the grain\nboundaries. The sandwiched, fine-grained nanocrystalline\nlayer has the most complicated structure, with a considerable\namount of crystallites and a similar amount of grain bound-\naries, which will act more as a-Si:H, and this is the true\nnanocrystalline layer from the partial melting regime.\nD. Surface roughness\nSignificant levels of surface roughness have been a char-\nacteristic of EL crystallization of a-Si:H. Several parameters\nhave been identified which influence the surface morphology\nof EL crystallized silicon. These include hydrogen evolution\nfrom a-Si:H, multiple shot crystallization,36 differences in\nlatent heat and thermal conductivity between crystalline and\namorphous silicon,38 capillary waves exited by volume\nchange at the silicon melt transition from liquid to solid,39\nand ambient condition of the irradiation atmosphere.36\nThe use of a semi-Gaussian beam shape reduces the\nroughness due to hydrogen evolution and keeping the irradi-\nating atmosphere in vacuum helps reduce mass transfer from\nsurface further. Surface roughnesses of the films were esti-\nmated by AFM over a 25 mm2 area. Figure 7 shows the\nsurface roughness variation with laser energy density. An\nincreasing trend of surface roughness is evident from the\nmeasurements for all three thicknesses, with a slight varia-\ntion in the 500 nm films. The sudden increase of roughness\nfor the 500 nm films starts at 150 mJ cm\u22122 and is attributed\nto 25% higher initial hydrogen percentage in the films sFig.\n5d compared to 300 nm thick films. Explosive evaporation of\nthis abundant hydrogen is expected to be the principal reason\nfor surface roughness to occur.36 From Fig. 6, it can be seen\nthat for 500 nm samples, hydrogen starts to evolve from the\ntop layer at 150 mJ cm\u22122. Therefore, it is proposed that even\nwith the optimum laser beam shape for hydrogen\nevolution,40 hydrogen evolution dominates the surface\nroughness of EL crystallized silicon.\nSurface roughness becomes a significant issue for TFT\napplications, due to uniformity related problems. However,\nthis phenomenon does show an interesting potential for solar\ncell applications.41 Figure 8 shows a three-dimensional s3Dd\nview of the surface micrograph of 500 nm sample crystal-\nlized at 250 mJ cm\u22122. The cross-sectional view shows the\nnature of the surface at this energy, which is highly desirable\nfor light trapping in photovoltaic applications. This quality of\nEL crystallized silicon can be very advantageous if the pro-\ncess is tailored for solar cell applications, yielding a surface\ntexturing process without additional cost.\nE. Dark conductivity\nRoom-temperature dark conductivities of the samples\nwere calculated from current\u2013voltage measurements. The\nelectrode configuration was coplanar, with a 3 mm effective\nlength and a 10 mm separation. Figure 9 shows the variation\nof dark conductivity with laser treatment. The conductivities\nof initial a-Si:H are of the order of 1\u02c610\u221210 S\/cm for 100\nand 300 nm samples, whereas for the 500 nm samples it is an\norder of magnitude higher. The dark conductivities of a-Si:H\nprepared by PECVD are highly sensitive to process\nparameters.28 It is proposed that 500 nm initial a-Si:H films\nare better quality material due to adequate hydrogen passiva-\ntion of dangling bonds, with its relatively higher hydrogen\nat. %. Dark conductivities increase rapidly with EL crystal-\nFIG. 6. Dehydrogenated depth of 300 and 500 nm samples against laser\nenergy density. FIG. 7.

This is proposed to be due to the amor-\nphous phase dominating from the thick unmelted layer un-\nderneath, compared to 100 nm films. Although dark conduc-\ntivities increase and start to show trends of saturation, similar\nwork previously reported shows an increase of conductivities\nup to 1 S\/cm.42 Higher conductivity from EL crystallized\nsilicon has been the most desirable feature for TFT applica-\ntions, with the higher conductivities caused by increased mo-\nbilities of the material.1 The increase in mobilty is accepted\nto be due to the grain boundaries in polycrystalline silicon,\nalthough it has not been dealt with by taking into account the\nstratified nature of EL crystallized silicon. Conductivity can\nalso be enhanced by addition\/activation of impurities during\nEL crystallization. It is proposed that this is not significant\nfor the films under discussion as they were not intentionally\ndoped and bulk impurity addition is insignificant at the base\npressure used for crystallization.\nIt is stated that dark conductivity should be less than 1\n310\u221210 S\/cm and photoconductivity should be greater than\n1310\u22125 S\/cm sRef. 43d for device quality amorphous and\nmicrocrystalline silicon, in the context of PV. In order to\nutilize the desirable properties of EL crystallized silicon,\ntheir dark conductivities need to be reduced. Grain-boundary\npassivation using hydrogen has been reported as an effective\nmeans of reducing the density of states in the gap,44 which\nmay be one method of addressing this problem. The in-\ncreased mobilities can effectively be used to realize desirable\njunction properties as well. Doped a-Si:H is reported to yield\nvery high conductivities,42 which can be used to make good\nohmic contacts.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe thickness dependence of structural, optical, and\nelectrical properties of EL crystallized silicon was investi-\ngated. The level of crystalline fraction sXcd was determined,\nand it is concluded that it is not possible to convert a-Si:H\nfilms thicker than 300 nm completely to polycrystalline sili-\ncon at this wavelength, without utilizing laser energy densi-\nties in excess of 300 mJ cm\u22122.

The presence of different levels of\nhydrogen in different sized crystallite layers is suggested to\nresult in different optical and electronic properties in each\nlayer. Hence, this structure is identified as a potential multi-\nphoton absorber, provided the complexities in transport and\ncollection are resolved. The surface roughness due to EL\ncrystallization is proposed as a \u2018no cost\u2019 surface texturing\nmechanism in the event of PV applications. Dark conductiv-\nity of the films increases after EL crystallization, and grain-\nboundary passivation with hydrogen is suggested to be a\npotential remedy for improvements, which needs further in-\nvestigation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Phillips Research Labo-\nratories, Redhill, Surrey, UK, for the supply of a-Si:H\nsamples, G.Y.
