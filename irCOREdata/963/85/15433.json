It is often assumed that increasing brain size was a general\nevolutionary trend in primates, yet recent fossil discoveries have documented brain size decreases in some\nlineages, raising the question of how general a trend there was for brains to increase in mass over evolutionary\ntime. We present the first systematic phylogenetic analysis designed to answer this question.\nResults: We performed ancestral state reconstructions of three traits (absolute brain mass, absolute body mass,\nrelative brain mass) using 37 extant and 23 extinct primate species and three approaches to ancestral state\nreconstruction: parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo. Both absolute and relative\nbrain mass generally increased over evolutionary time, but body mass did not. Nevertheless both absolute and\nrelative brain mass decreased along several branches. Applying these results to the contentious case of Homo\nfloresiensis, we find a number of scenarios under which the proposed evolution of Homo floresiensis\u2019 small brain\nappears to be consistent with patterns observed along other lineages, dependent on body mass and phylogenetic\nposition.\nConclusions: Our results confirm that brain expansion began early in primate evolution and show that increases\noccurred in all major clades. Only in terms of an increase in absolute mass does the human lineage appear\nparticularly striking, with both the rate of proportional change in mass and relative brain size having episodes of\ngreater expansion elsewhere on the primate phylogeny. However, decreases in brain mass also occurred along\nbranches in all major clades, and we conclude that, while selection has acted to enlarge primate brains, in some\nlineages this trend has been reversed. Further analyses of the phylogenetic position of Homo floresiensis and better\nbody mass estimates are required to confirm the plausibility of the evolution of its small brain mass. We find that\nfor our dataset the Bayesian analysis for ancestral state reconstruction is least affected by inclusion of fossil data\nsuggesting that this approach might be preferable for future studies on other taxa with a poor fossil record.\nBackground\nPhylogenetic comparative methods and ancestral state\nreconstruction play important roles in evolutionary biol-\nogy. They enable historical evolutionary processes, and\nthe function and evolution of specific traits, to be\ninferred from patterns of diversity in extant species\n[1-3]. Extant primate brains, which vary from 1.8 g\n(Microcebus murinus) to 1330 g (Homo sapiens), fall\nwithin the range of non-primate mammalian brain\nmasses [4]. However, after correcting for allometric\nscaling with body mass, primates have relatively large\nbrains compared to most other mammals [5]. A trend\ntowards brain expansion is assumed to have occurred\nthroughout primate evolution [6] and this has been\ninterpreted as an indication of directional selection on\ncognitive abilities, due, for example, to arms races in\nsocial cognition [7,8].\nRecent studies, however, indicate that brain size, mea-\nsured either in volume or mass, may have decreased in\nsome vertebrate lineages [9,10]. Decreases in both abso-\nlute and relative brain size appear to have occurred in a\nnumber of taxa including birds [11], bats [10], bovids\n[12], elephants [13] and hippopotami [14,15].

For at\nleast some of these cases it is likely that a reduction in\nbrain size has occurred to meet the demands of the spe-\ncies\u2019 changing ecological needs rather than being due to\ngeographical isolation per se [10,11].\nAlthough many studies have investigated the possible\nselective advantages and disadvantages of increased\nbrain size in primates [5,17-21], few consider how fre-\nquently brain size has reduced. Periods of primate evo-\nlution which show decreases in brain size are of great\ninterest as they may yield insights into the selective\npressures and developmental constraints acting on brain\nsize. Bauchot & Stephan [22] noted the evolution of\nreduced brain size in the dwarf Old World monkey\nMiopithecus talapoin and Martin [23] suggested relative\nbrain size in great apes may have undergone a reduction\nbased on the cranial capacity of the extinct hominoid\nProconsul africanus. Taylor & van Schaik [24]reported a\nreduced cranial capacity in Pongo pygmaeus morio com-\npared to other Orang-utan populations and hypothesise\nthis reduction is selected for as a result of scarcity of\nfood. Finally, Henneberg [25] has shown that during the\nlate Pleistocene human absolute brain size has decreased\nby 10%, accompanied by a parallel decrease in body size.\nThe importance of understanding the evolution of\nreduced brain size in primates has recently been\nbrought into sharp focus with the discovery of a small-\nbrained hominin, Homo floresiensis, which overlapped\nboth geographically and temporally with modern\nhumans [26,27]. This has challenged our understanding\nof human evolution and created much debate about\nwhether H. floresiensis was a distinct species or a patho-\nlogical example of modern humans [28-30]. Studies\ndescribing the endocast and post-cranial features of the\ntype specimen (LB1) have resulted in mixed conclusions\n[31-38]. Analyses using known cases of dwarfism to\nmodel brain and body size reduction in H. floresiensis\nfrom an ancestral Homo erectus population suggested\ninsular dwarfism cannot explain the smaller brain and\nbody size [[39,40]; but also [15]]. However, recent stu-\ndies have found that both the degree and temporal rate\nof reduction in brain and body size observed in H. flore-\nsiensis, assuming ancestry with H. erectus, fall within the\nrange of size reductions in other island primate species\n[41,42]. An alternative phylogenetic hypothesis for H.\nfloresiensis has recently been proposed and indicates\nthat this species may not have evolved by insular dwarf-\nism of a known Homo species [43]. Instead Argue et al\n[43] propose two equally parsimonious cladograms in\nwhich H. floresiensis is a distinct early species Homo,\nemerged after H. rudolfensis and either before or after\nH. habilis (Figure 1b &1c). The debate about the place\nof H. floresiensis in the primate tree and the possible\nevolutionary significance of its small size and encephali-\nzation could be illuminated by placing the specimens in\nthe context of a broader phylogenetic analysis.\nReconstructing ancestral brain and body sizes provides\na means of testing the generality of the trend of increas-\ning brain and body size through primate evolution. It\nalso provides estimates of brain and body sizes at key\npoints along the primate phylogeny allowing inferences\nto be made about the ecology of the ancestors of key\nclades, based on what we know about the relationship\nbetween body size, ecology and life history traits in liv-\ning primates [44,45]. However, before making any infer-\nences based on estimated ancestral states it is vital to\nperform a thorough comparison of reconstruction meth-\nods in order to obtain the most reliable estimates. Pre-\nvious studies have used weighted square change\nparsimony and maximum likelihood (ML) to reconstruct\nancestral character states and infer the adaptive origins\nof phenotypes [46-49] and to study important genotype-\nphenotype associations [50]. However, basing conclu-\nsions on these methods may be problematic as they fail\nto provide reliable estimates when there are directional\nevolutionary changes and can also be adversely affected\nwhen ancestral states fall outside the range of extant\nspecies [51,52], as is expected to be the case for primate\nbrain evolution [6]. Incorporating data from fossils can\nimprove ancestral reconstruction estimates as they may\nmore completely describe the range and temporal distri-\nbution of the character\u2019s history, and thus help improve\nthe estimated nodal values both in the presence of\ndirectional trends and when ancestral values are mark-\nedly different from extant species values [47,53]. More\nrecently, a method to model directional change and find\nthe best-fitting models of evolution prior to ancestral\nstate reconstruction in Bayesian framework has been\ndeveloped [54,55]. Whether this method performs better\nthan parsimony and ML in estimating ancestral states\nand whether it is influenced by including fossil data like\nother methods has yet to be examined using real\ndatasets.\nHere we investigate the evolution of brain and body\nmass in Primates and assess whether brain mass and\nbody mass show evidence of directional trends. Given\nthe strong allometric relationship between brain and\nbody mass [5,6], relative brain size is most commonly\nused in comparative studies [56] that aim to test the\nevolutionary significance of an increased brain mass\nabove that predicted from a species\u2019 body mass [for\nexample [7,57]]. However, absolute brain mass is of\nevolutionary relevance too [58,59]; it may be related to\ncognitive ability [60] and it is correlated with neuron\nnumber [61] which in turn is likely to have important\nimplications for cognitive performance [4]. Further-\nmore, analysis of absolute brain and body size is\nMontgomery et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:9\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/8\/9\nPage 2 of 19\nnecessary in order to interpret the nature of evolution-\nary changes in relative brain size. We therefore investi-\ngated the evolutionary history of both relative and\nabsolute brain size.\nFirst, we adopted three approaches to reconstructing\nthe evolutionary history of these traits: weighted\nsquared-change parsimony, maximum likelihood (ML)\nand Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n[54,55,62,63] (see Methods), and performed each analy-\nsis with and without inclusion of fossil data. Following\nprevious studies showing that ancestral state reconstruc-\ntion is improved by including fossil data particularly\nwhen traits evolved under a directional trend [47,53], we\nassessed the sensitivity of each method to the inclusion\nof fossil data, and also compared estimates across\nmethods. The aim of the model comparison is to test\nwhether any method produces consistent estimates with\nand without the inclusion of fossils, as this might sug-\ngest a more robust method which is less affected by\naspects of the trait\u2019s evolution which decrease the accu-\nracy of ancestral state reconstructions, such as direc-\ntional trends or ancestral values which lie outside of the\nrange of extant species. Second, to explicitly model and\nassess statistically whether there was a directional\nincrease in brain and body mass, we compared ancestral\nreconstruction when a directional constant-variance ran-\ndom walk model of evolution was assumed versus a\nnon-directional constant-variance random walk model\nas implemented in BayesTraits [54,55], using the phylo-\ngeny with fossil species included. We then examined the\nFigure 1 Phylogeny of primates with extinct primates. a) Phylogeny used for main reconstruction analysis.

Finally we\nuse our results to evaluate alternative scenarios about\nthe origin of H. floresiensis, specifically from three differ-\nent populations of H. erectus and from H. habilis. This\nanalysis aims to evaluate whether descent of H. floresien-\nsis from a putative ancestral population involves a\ndecrease in brain and body mass that is beyond those\nobserved in other primate lineages. Our analyses show\nthat ancestral state reconstruction can be an informative\nway to infer evolutionary processes using data from liv-\ning species, but highlight the need to assess the reliabil-\nity of these estimates when doing so.\nResults and discussion\nAncestral reconstructions: congruence between estimates\nwith and without fossil data\nPrevious studies have used either volume or mass as a\nmeasure of brain size. Here we used log10-transformed\nbrain and body mass in all analyses. Brain and body\nmass estimates were collected for 37 extant and 23\nextinct primate species (Additional file 1, Table S1). We\nfirst performed the reconstruction analysis using three\nalternative approaches (parsimony, ML and Bayesian\nMCMC in BayesTraits). Following Webster & Purvis\n[64], we then assessed the reliability of the estimates, by\ncomparing results obtained with and without fossil data\nusing correlations. In comparing results, estimates of\nancestral states for each node obtained in the Bayesian\nframework were taken as the average of the posterior\ndistribution. The phylogenies that we used are shown in\nFigure 1 (extant and extinct species) and Figure 2\n(extant species).\nAncestral values for all nodes of the tree with and with-\nout the inclusion of fossil data were highly correlated\nfor absolute brain mass (parsimony, Spearman\u2019s correla-\ntion coefficient (rs) = 0.932; ML, rs = 0.932; Bayesian\nMCMC, rs = 0.993, all P < 0.001) and body mass (parsi-\nmony, rs = 0.939; ML, rs = 0.941; Bayesian MCMC, rs =\n0.960, all P < 0.001). As expected, ML and parsimony\nmethods produce almost identical results for estimates\nmade with (rs = 1.000, P < 0.001) and without fossils (rs\n= 1.000, P < 0.001). We therefore only present the\nresults of further comparisons between ML and Baye-\nsian MCMC. The lower rs values in the parsimony and\nML analyses are caused by increased disparity between\nthe estimates at deeper nodes. In particular, estimates of\nlog(brain mass) using fossils are 10-15% lower for the\nroot (Figure 2, node 38), the ancestral haplorhine (39),\nthe ancestral anthropoid (40) and the ancestral New\nWorld monkey (54) than estimates made without inclu-\nsion of the fossil data (Figure 3a), suggesting the accu-\nracy of the estimates decreases at the deeper nodes\nwhen fossil data are not used. The standard errors in\nML analysis support this conclusion, being larger for\ndeeper nodes. Conversely, the results of the Bayesian\nMCMC analysis do not show this disparity and deep\nnodes fall on the same line as shallower nodes (Figure\n3a &3b) although confidence intervals of the root esti-\nmate are still higher than those of all other nodes (Addi-\ntional file 1, Table S3).\nThe results from the Bayesian analyses agree more\nstrongly with ML when fossil data are included than\nwhen they are excluded for both brain mass (with fos-\nsils: rs = 0.995, P < 0.001; without fossils: rs = 0.923, P <\n0.001; Figure 3c and 3d) and body mass (rs = 0.981, P <\n0.001 with fossils; rs = 0.926, P < 0.001 without fossils).\nThe greatest disparity between estimates made without\nfossils between parsimony\/likelihood analysis and Baye-\nsian MCMC analysis are found at the root (node 38),\nthe ancestral haplorhine (39), the ancestral anthropoid\n(40), the ancestral strepsirhine (65) and the ancestral\nlemur (68). When fossil data are included disparity\nbetween the MCMC & ML remain for nodes 38 and 39,\nwith the estimates from the Bayesian analysis being\nlower than those made by the other methods.\nTo measure relative brain mass for the species in the\ntree we performed a phylogenetically controlled GLS\nregression analysis between log(brain mass) and log\n(body mass) using ML in BayesTraits (see Methods),\nthat returned the following fit line: log(brain mass) =\n2.18 + 0.684 [log(body mass)]. We then reconstructed\nancestral character states for relative brain size with two\nalternative approaches. With the first approach, which\nwe term residuals second, we first inferred ancestral\nbrain and body sizes at each node and then derived rela-\ntive brain size as the residual brain size on body size\nusing the ancestral state estimates at the nodes and the\nphylogenetically controlled GLS equation. This approach\nhas the advantage of first finding the best fitting model\nfor brain and body mass, but does not explicitly model\nthe correlated evolution of brain and body mass, and\ncannot be used for testing directionality in the evolution\nof encephalization (relative brain mass) if brain and\nbody size evolved under different models. With the sec-\nond approach, residuals first, we explicitly modelled the\nevolution of encephalization as relative brain size, by\nfirst calculating the residuals of brain on body mass in\nthe extant species with the phylogenetically controlled\nfit line, and then used these residuals as data to perform\nan ancestral state reconstruction of relative brain size.\nThis approach has the advantage of modelling encepha-\nlization but it cannot incorporate two distinct models\nMontgomery et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:9\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/8\/9\nPage 4 of 19\nfor brain and body mass should they evolve under dif-\nferent models. These two approaches, however, pro-\nduced very similar relative brain size values, as the\nresiduals at each node returned by the two methods\nwere highly correlated (rs = 0.979, P < 0.001) and we\ntherefore present only the results of the residuals second\nmethod.\nThe level of congruence between ancestral state esti-\nmates made with and without fossil data was much\nlower for relative brain mass than for absolute brain\nmass. Spearman\u2019s rank correlations for all three methods\nwere highly significant although rs values were much\nlower for ML (rs = 0.743, P < 0.001) and parsimony (rs\n= 0.743, P < 0.001) than for the Bayesian analysis (rs =\n0.835, P < 0.001). All three approaches performed poorly\nwhen estimating ancestral states of deep nodes, as indi-\ncated by the large disparities between estimates made\nwith and without fossils (Figure 4a and 4b). Estimates of\nancestral relative brain mass using parsimony and ML\nwere highly consistent both with and without fossil data\nFigure 2 Phylogeny of extant primate genera. Branches are drawn proportional to time. This figure was prepared in Mesquite [110].\nMontgomery et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:9\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/8\/9\nPage 5 of 19\n(for both analyses: rs = 1.000, P < 0.001). The results\nfrom Bayesian MCMC analysis were again more similar\nto those estimated by the two other methods when fossil\ndata were included (rs = 0.994 with fossils, rs = 0.968\nwithout; Figure 4c and 4d).\nIt is interesting to note that for all three approaches\nthe estimated brain mass of the last common ancestor\nof humans and chimpanzees is larger when fossil data\nare not included. For example, the average estimate of\nbrain mass for the Homo-Pan ancestor using MCMC\nanalysis was 569.4 g (95% CI: 567.7 - 572.2 g) without\nfossils, while when fossils were included the average\nestimate was 425.6 g (95% CI: 424.2 to 426.8 g). This\nsuggests the mass of the human brain can exert a large\ninfluence over ancestral state reconstructions in the\ngreat ape clade.\nTo summarise, parsimony and ML produced ances-\ntral state estimates that were more discrepant between\nanalyses with and without fossils when compared to\nestimates obtained with Organ et al.\u2019s [55] method in\na Bayesian framework. Moreover, the estimates of the\nBayesian analysis were more consistent with those pro-\nduced by ML and parsimony when fossil data were\nincluded. These results thus suggest that Organ et al.\u2019s\n[55] method is more robust and therefore preferable\nfor reconstructing ancestral states with our dataset.\nAlthough we cannot say whether this approach will\ngenerally perform most reliably when reconstructing\nancestral states in taxa where little or no fossil data\nare available, our results suggest that this might be the\ncase. It would thus be interesting to test whether\nOrgan et al.\u2019s [55] method for reconstructing ancestral\nstates does perform better than parsimony and ML in\nthe absence of fossil data using simulations and data-\nsets where the ancestral states are known [for example,\n[51]].\nFigure 3 Correlations between estimates of absolute brain mass in log(grams). a) Correlations are shown with and without fossil data\nusing ML; b) with and without fossil data using Bayesian MCMC; c) without fossil data between ML and Bayesian MCMC results; d) with fossil\ndata between ML and bayesian MCMC results. Numbers indicate nodes in figure 2.\nMontgomery et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:9\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/8\/9\nPage 6 of 19\nOne possible reason for lower consistency in estimates\nwith and without fossils, particularly for ML and parsi-\nmony, might be the presence of directional trends [51,64].\nAlthough this problem can in part be mitigated by incor-\nporating fossil data that provide temporal information and\nvariation not observed among living species and improve\nthe accuracy of ancestral state reconstructions with these\ntwo methods [47,53], neither parsimony nor ML can expli-\ncitly model directional trends, unlike analyses in Bayesian\nframework. Thus, we next addressed this issue and tested\nwhether body size, brain size and encephalization evolved\nunder directional trends in primates.\nEvolutionary trends in body and brain mass evolution\nWe tested for evolutionary trends by comparing a direc-\ntional random-walk model to the non-directional ran-\ndom-walk model in BayesTraits. The implementation of\nthe directional model requires variation in root-to-tip\nbranch length [3,55,65] which in our otherwise ultra-\nmetric tree is provided by the inclusion of fossil data.\nTo explicitly test for directionality in encephalization\nrather than simply inferring this from the evolutionary\nhistories of brain and body mass, we used the residuals\nof brain size on body size of the species (computed as\nexplained above with the residuals first approach) as\nspecies data of relative brain size in this analysis. The\nresiduals second approach, in fact, could not be used in\nthis context since it is based on residuals computed at\ninternal nodes of the phylogeny.\nWe found no evidence for a directional trend in abso-\nlute body mass, as the directional model did not provide\na better fit to the data when compared to the non-direc-\ntional model (Table 1; Figure 5). Therefore, in agreement\nwith other authors [46,66], we conclude that there is no\nevidence that Cope\u2019s Rule [67,68], which states body size\ntends to increase through time, applies to primates. In\ncontrast there is strong evidence for a trend of increasing\nabsolute and relative brain size (Table 1; Figure 5) sug-\ngesting that the expansion of the primate brain has been\nof major evolutionary significance across the modern pri-\nmate phylogeny and throughout primate evolution.\nFigure 4 Correlations between estimates of relative brain mass. a) Correlations are shown with and without fossil data using ML; b) with\nand without fossil data using Bayesian MCMC; c) without fossil data between ML and Bayesian MCMC results; d) with fossil data between ML\nand bayesian MCMC results. Numbers indicate nodes in Figure 2.\nMontgomery et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:9\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/8\/9\nPage 7 of 19\nTo assess how the presence of a directional trend\naffects the accuracy of estimates made with a non-direc-\ntional model we performed correlations between the\nresults obtained from the directional and non-direc-\ntional models. Correlations between the estimates made\nfor absolute brain mass under the directional and non-\ndirectional models suggest no nodes are estimated less\naccurately than others under the non-directional con-\nstant-variance model (rs = 0.995, P < 0.001). However,\nthe directional model tends to give lower estimates for\nall nodes (Additional file 1, Figure S1 a). For relative\nbrain mass the rs between estimates under directional\nvs. non-directional model is lower (rs = 0.943, P <\n0.001) and, while nodes are generally estimated as hav-\ning lower values under the directional model (Additional\nfile 1, Figure S1 b), the ancestral state reconstructions\nfor the deepest nodestend to differ more drastically.\nTaken together our results suggest that the ancestral\nstate reconstruction procedure implemented in Bayesian\nframework following Organ et al. [55] might be more\nreliable in comparison to parsimony and ML methods,\nas it first identifies the best predictive model based on\nknown data, and then uses such model to infer\nunknown ancestral states. In addition it can explicitly\nmodel directionality, and therefore we could identify a\ndirectional trend to increase in both absolute and rela-\ntive brain mass - but not body mass - in primates. For\nthe purposes of this paper, we conclude that the most\nreliable estimates are thus obtained with Bayesian ana-\nlyses, under a non-directional random walk model for\nbody mass and directional random walk for absolute\nbrain mass (Additional file 1, Table S3). For a discussion\nof the rate parameters used in the final analyses see the\nSupplementary information and Additional file 1, Table\nS2.\nHaving obtained the most reliable estimates of ances-\ntral states at each node in the tree for each phenotype it\nis then possible to use these to make evolutionary infer-\nences. For example our most supported estimate of the\nbody mass at the root of the primate tree using Bayesian\nanalysis is largely consistent with some previous qualita-\ntive estimates. Martin [23] suggested the ancestral pri-\nmate probably weighed less than 500 g, while Fleagle\n[45] used early primate fossils to conclude that the\nancestral primate was probably as small as 20 g. This is\nsimilar to our estimated body mass at the root of the\nphylogeny obtained with the inclusion of fossil species\n(48.98 g, 95% CI: 48.97 g to 50.00 g; Figure 6). The esti-\nmate made without the fossils is similarly low (37.71 g,\nCI: 37.60 g to 37.76 g). Importantly, our estimate of\nbody mass at the root lies within the range of the pro-\nposed extinct sister-group to modern primates, the ple-\nsiadapiforms, which ranged from 7 g (the\nMicromomyidae family) to 3,000 g (the Carpolestidae\nFigure 5 Posterior distributions of log-likelihoods for the non-directional and directional models.

The posterior\ndistributions of ancestral state estimates were obtained using uniform priors, two million iterations and a sampling interval of 100 (see Methods).\nThe harmonic means and Bayes Factors of the posterior distributions are given in Table 1.\nTable 1 Tests for evolutionary trends1.\nPhenotype Harmonic mean Log(Lh): Constant-variance model Harmonic mean Log(Lh): Directional model Bayes Factor\nAbsolute body size -44.688 -45.275 -1.174\nAbsolute brain size -30.282 -27.087 6.390\nRelative brain size 1.647 8.576 13.857\n1 The model with the highest log-likelihood is the best-fitting model.\nMontgomery et al.

In contrast,\na much higher estimate of ancestral primate body mass\n[1,171 g (95% CIs: 236 to 3,610 g)] was recently\nobtained using a parsimony method and extant species\ndata only [46]. However, our results show that in the\nabsence of fossil data parsimony leads to overestimates\nof body size, thus questioning this conclusion.\nBody mass variation is associated with a number of\nbehavioural, ecological and life history traits\n[44,45,70-75] which are frequently used to infer charac-\nteristics of extinct species. Small body mass in extant\nprimates (less than 500 g) is usually associated with noc-\nturnality, an insectivorous trophic niche [76] and leaping\nmode of locomotion for species weighing less than 3,000\ng [45]. The probable small body mass of the ancestral\nprimate has been interpreted as evidence that it occu-\npied a fine-branch niche and was adapted for grasping\nsmall insect prey [23,77]. On the basis of correlates of\nbody mass and ecological and life history traits of living\nprimates [44,45], our estimated mass at the root would\nsuggest the ancestral primate was a leaping insectivore,\nwhich might have had a lifespan of four to six years.\nThis proposed ecology suggests that visual specialisation\nto meet the demands of a fine-branch, insect grasping\nniche may have had a significant role in the early expan-\nsion of the primate brain [18,23], a hypothesis consistent\nwith recent evidence revealing an association between\nvisual expansion and brain size in fossil endocasts of\nearly primates [78].\nOur reconstructions suggest the ancestral primate had\na small brain (120.23 mg, 95% CI: 114.42 mg to 126.33\nmg) which, in relative terms, was much smaller than in\nany living primate. This result is consistent with a study\nof a virtual endocast of Ignacius graybullianus, an Early\nEocene Plesiadapiform (Paromomyidae), indicating that\nearly euprimates exhibited only small advances in brain\nmass over ancestral groups and that the majority of\nincreases in brain size occurred after the origin of mod-\nern primates [78]. Finally we note that our best estimate\nof brain mass for the last common ancestor of Homo\nand Pan (338.75 mg, 95% CI: 321.37 mg to 340.64 mg;\nwhich equates to a cranial capacity of 355.16 cm3, 95%\nCI: 336.61 cm3 to 357.17 cm3) is similar to estimates for\nthe two earliest hominids known from the fossil record,\nthe 7.7 million year old Sahelanthropus tchadensis (360\nto 370 cm3;) [79] and the 4.4 million year old Ardipithe-\ncus ramidus (280 to 350 cm3) [80]. These two fossil spe-\ncies were not included in our analysis due to uncertainty\nin their phylogenetic position which has only recently\nbeen resolved [80].\nIncreases in brain mass in particular lineages\nWe next examined the amount of change along different\nbranches of the tree, both as total change along the\nbranches and as rate of change accounting for differ-\nences in branch lengths (see below). We first calculated\nthe means of the posterior distribution of the ancestral\nstates for each node, using the same posterior predictive\nmodel developed for brain and body mass, and we com-\nputed the change in absolute brain and body mass, and\nrelative brain mass (using the residuals second approach\ndescribed above) along each branch by comparing the\nvalues (either observed (Additional file 1, Table S1) or\nestimated (Additional file 1, Table S3)) at consecutive\nnodes. Our estimates show that both absolute and\nFigure 6 Posterior distributions of trait estimates for the LCA of living primates for a) body mass and b) brain mass.

The\naverage proportional change in absolute brain mass\nalong a branch is 0.243 (i.e. a 24.3% increase), with\nchanges greater than 0.344 being in the upper quartile,\nwhich includes branches from all the major clades of\nthe phylogeny. Notably, three of the top four propor-\ntional increases are along the deepest branches (ances-\ntral primate to ancestral strepsirrhine (node 38-node 65;\nsee Figure 2), 1.310; ancestral primate to ancestral hap-\nlorhine (38 to 39), 0.942; ancestral haplorhine to\nFigure 7 Evolutionary trajectories of brain and body mass.

Interestingly the pro-\nportional increase along the terminal human branch is\nonly the seventh largest change (0.594). However in\nterms of absolute change the terminal human branch\nshows the largest change, almost four times greater than\nthe second biggest change (the terminal Pongo branch).\nThe average proportional change in relative brain\nmass is 0.201 (that is, 20.1% increase), with changes\nabove 0.278 falling in the upper quartile, which again\nincludes branches from all major primate groups. The\nfive branches which show the largest increase in relative\nbrain mass are the terminal Tarsius branch (0.917), the\nterminal Daubentonia branch (0.837), the terminal\nGalago branch (0.514), the terminal human branch\n(0.479) and the branch between the last common ances-\ntor of Catarrhines and PlatyrrhinesSimiformes and the\nancestral Platyrrhine (40 to 54: 0.431). Because Dauben-\ntonia and Tarsius are no more gregarious than their\nclose relatives [81], this suggests that social complexity\nis unlikely to have been the sole factor in primate brain\nmass evolution [c.f [7]] and that other selective pres-\nsures have also been important. For example the large\nbrain of Daubentonia is partly due to olfactory speciali-\nsation [82,83] which is consistent with selection acting\non sensory systems having had a significant role in brain\nsize evolution [84]. The finding that the human branch\nonly comes fourth by this measure is perhaps surprising,\nbut we note that of these five branches the terminal\nhuman branch is the shortest.\nWe next examined evolutionary changes along\nbranches controlling for branch length (change relative\nto time). The average rates were an increase of 0.025\/\nmillion years (that is, a 2.5% increase\/million years) for\na proportional change in brain mass, 5,640 mg\/million\nyears for an absolute change in brain mass, and 0.020\/\nmillion years for a change in relative brain mass con-\nfirming that most change in relative brain mass was due\nto brain rather than body mass. The branch with the\nhighest rate of change in absolute brain mass is the\nterminal human branch (140,000 mg\/million years).\nHowever for rate of proportional change in absolute\nbrain mass the human branch comes only fourth, below\nthe branches between the last common ancestor of\nMacaques and other Papionini, and the last common\nancestor of baboons, mangabeys and mandrills (48 to\n49), the ancestral primate and ancestral haplorhine (38\nto 39) and the branch between the last common ances-\ntor of Cebinae, Aotinae and Callitrichidae, and the\nancestral Cebinae (58 to 60). The rate of change in rela-\ntive brain mass along the human branch (0.068\/million\nyears) is also exceeded by the branch between the last\ncommon ancestor of Alouatta, Ateles and Lagothrix\nwith the last common ancestor of Ateles and Lagothrix\n(branch 55 to 56; 0.73), the branch connecting the last\ncommon ancestor of Cebinae, Aotinae and Callitrichi-\ndae, and the ancestral Cebinae (branch 58 to 60; 0.074\/\nmillion years) and the branch connecting the last com-\nmon ancestor of the Papionini with the last common\nancestor of Papio, Mandrillus and Cercocebus (branch\n48 to 49; 0.084). We therefore conclude that only in\nterms of absolute mass and the rate of change in abso-\nlute mass has the increase in brain size been exceptional\nalong the terminal branch leading to humans. Once\nscaling effects with body mass have been accounted for\nthe rate of increase in relative brain mass remains high\nbut is not exceptional.\nIt is also notable that the estimated brain size of the\nlast common ancestor of modern primates is smaller\nrelative to body size than any living species and that the\nexpansion of the primate brain began early, with the\ndeepest branches (for example, 38 to 39; 38 to 65; 39 to\n40) ranking in the upper quartile in terms of both\nincreases in absolute and relative brain mass (Additional\nfile 1, Table S4).\nDecreases in brain mass and evolutionary scenarios for H.\nfloresiensis\nDespite both absolute and relative brain mass showing\nstrong and significant evolutionary trends to increase,\nwe find several branches go against this trend (examples\nshown in Figure 7c and 7d; Additional file 1, Table S4).\nAbsolute brain mass decreases on approximately 14% of\nbranches (10\/70); independent decreases are observed in\nOld World monkeys (the terminal Cercocebus branch);\nin New World monkeys - several branches in the calli-\ntrichids, supporting the conclusion that this family has\nevolved by a process of phyletic dwarfism [85]; and in\nstrepsirhines - several branches in the lemur clade.\nBranches on which there is an overall decrease in abso-\nlute brain mass account for approximately 6% of the\ntotal evolutionary time covered by the phylogeny used\nin this analysis. In all cases a decrease in absolute brain\nmass is accompanied by a decrease in absolute body\nmass. Body mass decreases much more frequently: 46%\nof branches show a decrease, accounting for 47% of the\ntotal evolutionary time covered. Decreases in relative\nbrain mass occur less frequently, with only 4% (3\/70) of\nbranches showing a decrease in relative brain mass,\nrepresenting only 2.1% of evolutionary time. Decreases\nin relative brain mass mostly appear to be linked to\nbody mass increasing to a greater extent than brain\nmass. This, for example, provides some support for the\nhypothesis that small relative brain size in gorillas\nreflects increased somatisation rather than decreased\nencephalization [[86]; but see [87]].\nTo assess whether the proposed evolution of Homo\nfloresiensis is consistent with observed decreases in\nMontgomery et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:9\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/8\/9\nPage 11 of 19\nbrain mass which have occurred elsewhere in the pri-\nmate phylogeny, we calculated the ratio change in brain\nand body mass [(brain descendant - brain ancestor)\/\n(body descendant-body ancestor)] for branches showing\na decrease, in order to facilitate comparisons with the\nliterature (see methods). We used log values to take var-\niation in body mass into account; decreases here are\ntherefore proportional decreases in absolute mass. Our\naim in this analysis is not to estimate the probability or\nlikelihood of the evolution of a hominin with reduced\nbrain and body mass but rather to test whether or not\ndecreases seen during the evolution of Homo floresiensis\nfall within the range of other observed decreases in Pri-\nmates. First we consider the evolution of the H. flore-\nsiensis brain assuming descent from a known hominin\nby insular dwarfism, a widely cited hypothesis\n[15,16,39,40]. For the 10 branches which showed a\ndecrease the average ratio was 0.265 and the range was\n0.006 to 0.825. We calculated the same ratio using H.\nfloresiensis (estimated brain mass c. 380 g [26,31]) and\nthree possible ancestral forms of Homo erectus, follow-\ning Martin et al. [39]: Homo erectus broadly defined,\nNgandong H. erectus, and Dmanisi hominins. We also\ninclude Homo habilis which has not been ruled out as a\npossible ancestor [36]. The change in brain size and the\nratio of the change in brain and body mass were calcu-\nlated for the two extreme values of body mass estimated\nfor H. floresiensis (16 and 32 kg) [26] and their mid-\npoint. In addition we used the brain\/body mass scaling\nrelationships [(brain descendant - brain ancestor)\/(body\ndescendant-body ancestor)] during the 10 decreases in\nbrain mass to estimate the decrease in brain mass\nexpected for the observed decrease in body mass for\neach ancestor and body mass. The results of this analy-\nsis are shown in Additional file 1, Table S5 and invoke\nsimilar conclusions to those discussed below.\nUnder a number of scenarios the evolution of H. flore-\nsiensis lies within the range of decreases in brain mass\nestimated here (Table 2). For any ancestor, except\nNgandong hominoids, and a H. floresiensis body mass of\n16 kg the decreases in brain and body mass always fall\nwithin the range of the decrease that we found in other\nprimate branches. For a H. floresiensis body mass of 32\nkg the decrease in relative brain mass is not consistent\nwith changes estimated in other branches, but assuming\na body mass estimate of 24 kg and descent from a Dma-\nnisi hominin population, the decrease in relative brain\nsize falls within the range of decreases observed else-\nwhere in the primate phylogeny. We also note that for\nboth body mass estimates the proportional change in\nabsolute brain mass from either a Dmanisi hominin\n(-0.216) or H. habilis (-0.137)ancestor is actually smaller\nthan the decrease in the terminal Microcebus branch\n(-0.273). Finally the calculated change in relative brain\nmass from any of the four ancestors is compatible with\nthe results obtained here only for a H. floresiensis body\nmass close to 16 kg, or descent from either a Dmanisi\nhominin or H. habilis if H. floresiensis had a body mass\ntowards 24 kg.\nThus under the insular dwarfism model, if H. flore-\nsiensis descended from either an \u2018average\u2019 H. erectus or\nNgandong populations, the decrease in brain mass is\nnot compatible with our results unless H. floresiensis\nhad a body mass near 16 kg. The evolution of H. flore-\nsiensis also appears less likely if it had a body mass\ntowards the upper estimate, as the decrease in relative\nbrain mass falls outside our estimates on other\nbranches. However, if H. floresiensis had a body mass of\n16 to 24 kg, descent from either a Dmanisi hominin or\nH. habilis ancestor is in line with decreases in brain and\nbody mass along other primate lineages. We therefore\nconclude that further studies addressing the affinities of\nTable 2 Evolution of brain size during the evolution of H. floresiensis from four possible ancestors by insular dwarfism.\nAncestor H. floresiensis body\nmass (kg)\nRatio of change in log(absolute brain mass) &\nlog(body mass)2\nChange in log(brain\nmass)\nChange in log(relative\nbrain mass)\nH. erectus 16 0.720* -0.398 -0.020*\n24 1.058 -0.398 -0.141\n32 1.586 -0.398 -0.226\nNgandong 16 0.784 -0.450 -0.058\n24 1.131 -0.450 -0.178\n32 1.649 -0.450 -0.264\nDmanisi 16 0.437* -0.216* 0.122*\n24 0.678* -0.216* 0.002*\n32 1.116 -0.216* -0.084\nH. habilis 16 0.420* -0.137* 0.059*\n24 0.908 -0.137* -0.034\n32 5.219 -0.137* -0.147\n1 computed as: [(brain descendant - brain ancestor)\/(body descendant-body ancestor)]\n* indicates a result which falls within the range of decreases in brain size for Primates estimated in this study.\nMontgomery et al.

Our analysis sug-\ngests it is possible that, under the insular dwarfism\nmodel, the only unexpected aspect of H. floresiensis\u2019\nevolution is the rate at which brain mass decreased,\nhowever some evidence suggests morphological evolu-\ntion may accelerate on islands [88].\nNext we performed several analyses to test whether\nthe evolution of the H. floresiensis brain under the alter-\nnative phylogenetic scenario proposed by Argue et al.\n[43] by estimating the ancestral brain and body masses\nof the node at the base of the H. floresiensis lineage\n(Additional file 1, Table S6) and subsequently analysing\nthe evolution of brain size along that lineage. The analy-\nsis was run for each of the two most parsimonious trees\nseparately and then for both trees together, taking\nadvantage of BayesTraits ability to take phylogenetic\nuncertainty into account. The results again suggest that\nif H. floresiensis body mass did not greatly exceed 24 kg\nthe decrease in brain size observed along the lineage\nleading to H. floresiensis falls within the range seen else-\nwhere in the primate phylogeny, scales with body mass\nin a way consistent with other episodes of brain mass\nreductions, and actually results in an increase in relative\nbrain size (Table 3; Additional file 1, Table S7). Conver-\nsely, a larger body size produces an allometric decrease\nin brain size beyond the range observed in the primate\ntree. To conclude, for a body mass toward the lower\nend of the range of estimates all the phylogenetic\nhypotheses on the ancestry of H. floresiensis so far pro-\nposed are consistent with the observed decrease in brain\nsize. An alternative method of these hypotheses based\non using the model of brain evolution developed in\nBayesTraits is presented in the supplementary informa-\ntion, and produces results broadly consistent with the\nmain analysis.\nTo further study the selective pressures and anatomical\nchanges associated with decreases in brain mass we sug-\ngest Microcebus, Callithrix and Miopithecus or Cercoce-\nbus may be useful, independent models. For example,\nFalk et al. [31] identified a number of potentially derived\nfeatures in an endocast of H. floresiensis, and comparative\nanalyses of the brain anatomies of these species might\nshow whether similar structures are modified in indepen-\ndent episodes of brain mass reduction. Likewise a com-\nparative analysis of the ecologies of these smaller brained\nprimates may reveal selective pressures associated with\ndecreases in brain and body mass. We note that for both\ndecreases in absolute and relative brain mass there\nappears to be no relation with isolation on islands, nor is\nthere any clear single ecological trait that can explain\nthese decreases. As with evolutionary increases in brain\nmass, decreases in mass are likely to be influenced by a\nnumber of ecological factors. For example, Taylor & van\nSchaik [24] have shown that brain size has decreased dur-\ning the evolution of Pongo p. morio, particularly in\nfemales. These authors suggest this reduction is asso-\nciated with an increase in periods of food scarcity result-\ning in selection to minimise brain tissue which is\nmetabolically expensive [17]. Food scarcity is also\nbelieved to have played a role in the decrease in brain\nsize in the island bovid Myotragus [12]. Taylor & van\nSchaik [24] therefore propose that H. floresiensis may\nhave experienced similar selective pressures as Myotragus\nand Pongo p. morio. Future studies are needed to address\nthe relative contributions of proposed social and ecologi-\ncal factors in both decreases and increases in brain mass\nacross Primates and other species.\nConclusions\nBy reconstructing ancestral states of brain and body\nmass in primates we have shown that Organ\u2019s et al [55]\nmethod, implemented in BayesTraits using Bayesian\nanalysis, is least affected by the inclusion of fossil data\nTable 3 Evolution of brain size during the evolution of H. floresiensis under two phylogenetic scenarios1.\nAncestor H. floresiensis body mass (kg) Ratio of change in\nlog(absolute brain mass) & log(body mass)2\nChange in\nlog(brain mass)\nChange in\nlog(relative brain mass)\nArgue Tree 1 16 0.400* -0.171* 0.121*\n24 0.639* -0.171* 0.012*\n32 1.116 -0.171* -0.066\nArgue Tree 2 16 0.428* -0.173* 0.104*\n24 0.709* -0.173* -0.006*\n32 1.336 -0.173* -0.084\nBoth trees 16 0.418* -0.176* 0.110*\n24 0.679* -0.176* -0.001*\n32 1.225 -0.176* -0.076\n1 These are the two most parsimonious topologies obtained by Argue et al.

BMC Biology 2010, 8:9\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/8\/9\nPage 13 of 19\nand is therefore more reliable for our dataset. In this\nrespect this approach outperforms parsimony and ML\nmethods which instead tend to produce lower estimates\nat deep nodes when using only data of extant species.\nThis is likely to be because BayesTraits first identifies\nthe best predictive model based on known tip data to\nthen infer unknown ancestral states at each node of\ninterest in the tree and can incorporate evolutionary\ntrends. If Organ et al.\u2019s [55] method generally outper-\nforms ML and parsimony methods, this may have\nimportant implications for future studies which attempt\nto estimate ancestral states in groups where little fossil\ninformation is available, or where evolutionary trends\nare suspected, especially when the reconstruction is per-\nformed on deep nodes within phylogenies which cover\nlarge time periods. Studies on datasets with known\nancestral states are thus needed to fully assess if the\nmethod implemented in BayesTraits consistently pro-\nduces more reliable ancestral state reconstructions.\nOur results provide robust confirmation for the sug-\ngestion that strong evolutionary trends have governed\nthe expansion of the primate brain. In contrast body\nsize evolution has not tended to increase in primates,\nimplying brain and body mass have been subject to\nseparate selection pressures and supporting the findings\nof previous studies in other taxonomic groups that these\ntwo highly correlated traits can show differences in their\npatterns of evolution [89,90]. In primates, brain mass\nhas independently expanded in both absolute and rela-\ntive terms in all the major clades of the primate phylo-\ngeny and began to increase early in primate evolution.\nWe have highlighted branches along which the change\nor rate of change in brain mass is particularly large. Sur-\nprisingly only in terms of change in absolute mass is the\nterminal human branch exceptional; once scaling effects\nare accounted for, humans rank only seventh. Despite\nthe presence of an overall trend to increase mass, we\nalso provide evidence for independent decreases in brain\nmass in New and Old World Monkeys and in strepsir-\nhines. From our analyses of evolution of H. floresiensis\nbrain size under different phylogenetic hypotheses, we\nconclude that the evolution of H. floresiensis is consis-\ntent with our results across the primate phylogeny if it\neither evolved from populations of H. habilis or Dmanisi\nhominin by insular dwarfism, or under Argue et al.\u2019s\n[43] proposed phylogenetic scenarios, and if H. floresien-\nsis had a body mass towards the lower end of the range\nof estimates obtained from skeletal remains. In this\nrespect we note that Brown et al. [26] suggested the\nlower body mass estimates are probably most appropri-\nate, assuming H. floresiensis shared the lean body shape\ntypical of Old World tropical modern humans. If this\nwere true we estimate the evolution of H. floresiensis\ninvolved a reasonable decrease in absolute brain mass,\nbut an increase in relative brain size. Our analysis,\ntogether with studies of brain size in island populations\nof living primates[41,42], therefore suggests we should\nperhaps not be surprised by the evolution of a small\nbrained, small bodied hominin, although further clarifi-\ncation of the relationships between H. floresiensis and\nother hominins are required to confirm this observation.\nFinally, our analyses add to the growing number of stu-\ndies that conclude that the evolution of the human\nbrain size has not been anomalous when compared to\ngeneral primate brain evolution [59,61,91,62-94].\nMethods\nBrain and body mass data\nData for body and brain mass were obtained from pre-\nviously published datasets [22,82,95]. For reconstruc-\ntions of ancestral brain and body mass, we used data\nfrom as many extant genera as possible, leading to a\ndataset of 37 primate genera including 14 catarrhines,\n12 platyrrhines, 1 tarsier and 10 strepsirhines (Addi-\ntional file 1, Table S1a).\nThrough a literature search we obtained data for fos-\nsils where cranial remains were sufficiently intact to\nmake reliable estimates of cranial capacity (N = 23,\nAdditional file 1, Table S1b). We converted cranial\ncapacity to brain mass using the equation given in Mar-\ntin [23]: Log(cranial capacity) = [1.018 \u00d7 Log(brain\nmass)] - 0.025. Where body and brain mass estimates\nwere not available from the same individual we took the\nbody mass estimate for the species given in Fleagle [45].\nThe dataset includes seven extinct hominins, which we\nuse to examine whether ancestral values were overly\ninfluenced by the large disparity between the brain mass\nof Homo sapiens and the other apes.\nTo calculate relative brain mass we performed a phylo-\ngenetically-controlled regression analysis (see below)\nbetween log(brain mass) and log(body mass) in Bayes-\nTraits [54,96]. In all the analyses using Generalised Least\nSquares models (GLS), the phylogeny is converted into a\nvariance-covariance matrix representing the shared evolu-\ntionary path between the species [3,54,65]. The GLS\nregression analysis was performed with ML and MCMC.\nBayesian MCMC analyses were completed using uniform\npriors (prior range -100.00 to 100.00), with 2,000,000 itera-\ntions and a sampling period of 100, after a burn in of\n500,000. The rate deviation was set to obtain an average\nparameter acceptance rate of 20 to 40%. We first identi-\nfied, in Bayesian framework [97,98], the regression model\nthat best described the relationship between brain and\nbody mass, by testing whether additional branch-length\nscaling parameters to the default Brownian motion model\nimproved the fit to the data. These were lambda, which\nreveals to what extent the phylogeny predicts the pattern\nof covariance between species for a trait (the phylogenetic\nMontgomery et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:9\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7007\/8\/9\nPage 14 of 19\nsignal); kappa, which stretches and compresses branch\nlengths; and delta, which scales path lengths. As these\nparameters can improve the fit to the data, we first esti-\nmated all parameters at once following Organ et al. [55]\nand, where a parameter was significantly different from\nthe default value of 1, indicating gradualism, it was then\nestimated in the final regression analysis. However, while\nlambda can be estimated alone, kappa and delta are better\nestimated as additional parameters in the model that also\nincluded lambda. The regression was highly significant (t59\n= 14.53, R2 = 0.858, P < 0.001), the branch-length scaling\nparameters lambda and delta were not significantly differ-\nent from the default value of one (lambda: lambda =\n0.979, LR = 2.04, P = 0.153; delta: delta = 1.091, LR = 0.03,\nP = 0.857). Conversely, kappa was estimated to be 0.474,\nsignificantly different to one (LR = 8.132, P = 0.004).\nRelative brain mass on body mass for each species\n(extant or extinct) was calculated as residual values\nusing the regression equation (see below). These resi-\nduals were used to test for an evolutionary trend to\nincrease relative brain mass and to reconstruct ancestral\nstates (residuals first).\nPhylogeny\nIt is important to incorporate both topology and branch\nlength information during reconstruction analyses as\nspecies are part of a hierarchically structured phylogeny,\ntherefore not statistically independent, and differences\nin time since divergence from the common ancestors\ndetermines differential potential for evolutionary change\n[3,47,99,100]. We used a genus level composite phylo-\ngeny of primates using published trees. The topology is\ntaken from Goodman et al. [101] for haplorhine pri-\nmates and Horvath et al. [102] for strepsirhines. Propor-\ntional branch lengths were obtained from recent studies\nof primate divergence dates [103-106] scaled to agree\nwith dates of divergence for the deeper primate nodes\nestimated by Steiper & Young [107]. The tree obtained\ntherefore has branch length information and is ultra-\nmetric. There are two trichotomies: one between the\nCebidae, Pitheciidae and Atelidae, the other at the base\nof Cebidae (Figure 2). As the topology of our composite\nphylogeny is well studied and the branch lengths are\nbased on the best available divergence date estimates in\nall subsequent analyses it is assumed our phylogeny is\nknown without error.\nWhere fossil data were included we follow Finarelli &\nFlynn [47] in minimising phylogenetic assumptions and\nplaced extinct taxa as polytomies at the node nearest to\ntheir estimated position in the primate phylogeny.\nBranch lengths for fossil species were calculated as the\ntime from this node to the end of the geological period\nin which they are last found. Both phylogenetic relation-\nships and temporal presence in the fossil record were\ntaken from Fleagle [45]. Where the programs described\nbelow require a fully bifurcating tree, trichotomies were\nrandomly resolved and the new, intervening branch\ngiven a branch length of zero.\nWe also use the two most parsimonious Hominin\ntopologies obtained by Argue et al. [43]. Here branch\nlengths were determined based on the earliest and latest\nknown fossils for each species [27,45,108,109], with\ndivergence dates of internal nodes coming from the first\nappearance of any species within the lineages which\nevolved from that node. Where the time of origin for a\nlineage could not be determined in this way we mini-\nmise phylogenetic assumptions by placing in the node\nin centre of the branch. The rest of the phylogeny was\nidentical to that presented in Figure 1[110].\nReconstruction methods\nAncestral state reconstructions of absolute brain and\nbody mass and relative brain mass at each node of the\nphylogeny were estimated using three methods:\nweighted squared-change parsimony in the Mesquite\n[101], ML in the program ANCML [63], and Bayesian\nMCMC [97,98], in BayesTraits following Organ et al.\u2019s\n[55] method, all of which incorporate phylogenetic\ninformation\nWeighted squared-change parsimony infers ancestral\nstates by minimising the square-change along branches\n[62,63], but parsimony approaches are not robust to vio-\nlations of assumptions of constant rate of evolution or\nequal probability of change in either direction\n[3,51,64,111]. Throughout the paper we refer to this\nmethod as Parsimony method.\nML reconstruction is based on a Brownian motion\nmodel to estimate transitions at any node along the phy-\nlogeny. The advantages of this method are that the\nprobability of change at any point in the tree is not\ndependent on a prior state change or on changes on\nother branches [2]. Like parsimony approaches however,\nthe model assumes a constant rate of evolution and may\nperform poorly if the trait shows an evolutionary trend\n[2,51,64] (see below). Throughout the paper we refer to\nthis method as the ML method.\nFinally, the ancestral state reconstructions of brain and\nbody size were performed in Bayesian framework with\nMCMC in BayesTraits [3,54], following the method\ndescribed in Organ et al. [55]. Throughout the paper we\nrefer to the results obtained from BayesTraits as the Baye-\nsian analysis. BayesTraits first identifies the best fitting\nevolutionary model (see below) to the species data, and\nthen uses such model to infer unknown ancestral states at\ninternal nodes along the tree. The ancestral state recon-\nstruction is therefore performed in two steps. The con-\nstant variance random walk model has only one\nparameter, alpha, which describes the instantaneous var-\niance of evolution [3,65]; this model represents the default\nmodel with all branch length scaling parameters, kappa,\nMontgomery et al.

We then simultaneously\nestimated the branch length scaling parameters, because\nthese parameters can improve the fit to the data and thus\nhelp identify the best evolutionary model for the data. We\ntested whether the branch scaling parameters differed\nfrom the default value of one by comparing the harmonic\nmean of the model in which the parameters were esti-\nmated to the harmonic mean of the model where they\nwere set as one, using Bayes factors. The Bayes Factor is\ncomputed as: 2(log [harmonic mean(directional model) -\nlog[harmonic mean(constant variance model)]. A positive\nBayes factor greater than two is taken as positive evidence\nfor a difference between the two models with the best fit-\nting model having the highest log(harmonic mean), a\nBayes factor greater than five represent strong evidence\nand greater than 10 is very strong evidence [97]. Thus, the\ndefault value of one for a scaling parameter was used in\nthe final analysis when the Bayes factor was less than two.\nWhere they did, the rate parameters were incorporated in\nthe estimation for the best fitting model (see supplemen-\ntary information). Therefore, contrary to parsimony and\nML, this method has the advantage of finding the best\nmodel of trait evolution before estimating ancestral states.\nResults of the Bayesian analysis obtained using 2 or 10\nmillion runs were qualitatively similar, therefore we per-\nformed all analyses with two million runs. All analyses\nwere performed using uniform priors (prior range: -100\nto +100), with 2,000,000 MCMC runs after a burn-in of\n500,000, sampling every 100 runs, and repeated multiple\ntimes to test the stability of the harmonic means. Rate\ndeviation was adjusted to obtain an acceptance of the\nproposed model parameters (above) between 20% and\n40%. Ancestral state reconstructions were then simulta-\nneously estimated using the best evolutionary model for\nthe data; data deviation was adjusted to obtain an accep-\ntance rate for each node\u2019s estimate between 20 to 40%.\nNext we tested if a directional-change random walk\nmodel improved the fit to the data relative to the best\nnon-directional random walk (Brownian motion) model\nobtained as described above. While the non-directional\nrandom walk model has one parameter - alpha, the var-\niance of evolution - the directional random-walk model\nhas an additional parameter that captures the directional\nchange using a regression between trait values and the\ntotal path length (beta) [3,65]. Because all species have\nthe same total path length in ultrametric trees, this ana-\nlysis could be done only with the tree that incorporated\nfossil species as the directional model requires root-to-\ntip (path length) variation in order to estimate direction-\nality unless the scaling parameters are used. The harmo-\nnic mean of the likelihoods of the directional and non-\ndirectional random walk models can be compared with\nBayes factors [97,98] to determine which model fits the\ndata best (see above).\nANCML (ML analysis) provide standard errors for each\nnodal value reconstruction. However, some authors con-\nsider standard errors to be underestimated and difficult\nto compare across methods [52]. The vast majority of\nposterior distributions of estimates made by the Bayesian\nMCMC runs were normally distributed using a W-test,\nso we present the mean and 95% confidence intervals for\neach node. To test for the sensitivity of each method to\nthe inclusion of fossil species, we followed Webster &\nPurvis [64] and checked the strength of the association\nbetween estimates at each node made with and without\nfossil data using correlation analysis in GenStat (VSNi,\nHemel Hempstead, UK). For the Bayesian analysis we\nthus calculated the mean of the posterior distribution of\nthe ancestral states at each node of the tree. Because\nsome sets of estimates made with different methods were\nnot normally distributed, we used Spearman\u2019s rank corre-\nlation for all tests to allow correlation coefficients (rs) to\nbe fully comparable throughout the analysis.\nThe change in brain and body mass along each branch\nwas calculated by taking the difference between consecu-\ntive nodes. As the estimates for each node using absolute\nvalues of log brain and body mass are log values, sub-\ntracting consecutive node values gives a proportional\nchange in mass. We therefore also converted log values\ninto absolute numbers before calculating differences to\nget the absolute change in mass. Estimates of ancestral\nrelative brain mass are based on residual values from a\nregression analysis of two log values. We therefore simply\nsubtracted successive nodes to calculate change in rela-\ntive brain mass. Finally, to control for differential poten-\ntial in divergence due to longer time since the last\nsplitting event we repeated the analysis and calculated\nthe rate of change by dividing the change along a branch\nby the branch length, for each measure of brain mass.\nAdditional file 1: Supplementary tables and figures. 1.
