In particular we have new measurements of the structure functions\nby the H1 [1, 2, 3] and ZEUS [4] collaborations at HERA, and of the inclusive jet distribution\nby the D0 [5] and CDF [6] collaborations at the Tevatron. These new data are both more\nprecise and extend the kinematic range, and thus constrain the parton distributions, and the\nstrong coupling \u03b1S, more tightly than ever before. ZEUS have also released a new measurement\nof the charm contribution to the structure function [7] which, although it still has large errors,\ncovers a wider kinematic range than previously. In addition, the CCFR collaboration [8] have\nre-analysed their neutrino data in a model independent way and the discrepancy with the NMC\ndata for x <\u223c 0.1 has been largely resolved. Also NuTeV data are becoming available [9], both for\nsingle and double muon production, and are improving the constraints from the neutrino sector.\nThe E866 collaboration [10] also have increased statistics for pp and pn Drell-Yan production\nand improve the determination of the difference between the u\u00af and d\u00af distributions. Finally we\nnote that as well as the usual data sets used in our previous fits, i.e. BCDMS [11] and SLAC\n[12] proton data, NMC proton and deuterium data [13], E665 proton data and deuterium data\n[14], CCFR data on F\n\u03bd(\u03bd\u00af)N\n3 (x,Q\n2) [15], E605 Drell-Yan data [16] and CDF W -asymmetry data\n[17] we have also included BCDMS [18] and SLAC deuterium data [12] in order to obtain as\nprecise a determination of the separate contributions of the up and down valence quarks at high\nx as possible.2 We also include the most recent ZEUS SVX data [20] since it spans a slightly\ndifferent range to that in [4]. We no longer include prompt photon data due to theoretical\nproblems and possible inconsistencies between data sets, and instead allow the high x gluon to\nbe determined by the vastly improved Tevatron jet data.\nWe note that both H1 [3] and ZEUS [4] have recently performed NLO DGLAP fits to their\nrespective data, supplemented in the former case by BCDMS data with y\u00b5 > 0.3, and in the\nlatter case by BCDMS, NMC, E665 and CCFR F\n\u03bd(\u03bd\u00af)N\n3 (x,Q\n2) data. In particular, the H1\nanalysis determines \u03b1S and the gluon simultaneously. A value\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.1150 \u00b1 0.0017(expt.)\n+0.0009\n\u22120.0005\n(model) (1)\nis obtained, with an additional uncertainty of about\u00b10.005, mainly due to the uncertainty in the\nrenormalization scale. A preliminary ZEUS analysis, reported at DIS2001, quoted \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) =\n0.1172\u00b1 0.0008(uncor.)\u00b1 0.0054(cor.) [21]. There is also an analysis including some of both the\nrecent H1 and ZEUS data along with NMC, SLAC and BCDMS data, and which allows higher\ntwist contributions, which obtains \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.1171 \u00b1 0.0015(expt.) [22]. We will find that\nthe inclusion of additional data sets tend to increase these values somewhat. As an example\nof this we emphasize that the Tevatron jet data are an important ingredient in pinning down\nthe value of \u03b1S from deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and related data, since they provide the\n2For all deuterium structure functions we correct for shadowing effects [19].\n1\ndominant constraint on the gluon at large x. In fact, the inclusion of new jet data [5, 6] into\nthe global analysis considerably improves the determination of the gluon. For example, we find\nan uncertainty of about 15% on the gluon distribution at x = 0.4 and Q2 = 20 GeV2, but this\nis correlated with the value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ).\n2 The new optimum parton set\nWe perform a global NLO DGLAP analysis incorporating all the high-precision data mentioned\nin the Introduction. The evolution begins at Q20 = 1 GeV\n2 where there are three active quark\nflavours. We work in the MS renormalization scheme and use the Thorne-Roberts [23] variable\nflavour number procedure to evolve through the charm and bottom thresholds. We note that\nwe let all data sets in the fit carry equal weight. This is because we now feel that the full\nset of data is spread relatively evenly over the kinematic range of x and Q2, and also over the\ndifferent partons, e.g. the Tevatron jet data is now extensive enough to determine the high x\ngluon accurately, and we no longer have to give existing data a high weight to tie down this\nparticular region of parton space. In fact those data sets with very few points, e.g. the E866\nDrell-Yan asymmetry measurements, probe partons (in this case d\u00af\u2212 u\u00af) to which the rest of the\ndata are rather insensitive, and the few points with unit weight are sufficient. We note that our\nbest fit gives a \u03c72 per point of about 1 for all data sets (except for the E605 Drell-Yan data,\nfor the reason given in section 6) justifying the equal weighting.\nAs well as deciding on data sets and weights, we have to decide on a set of cuts in the usual\nvariables Q2, W 2 and x. In order to investigate this we made a study of the sensitivity of the\nanalysis to variation of these data cuts. We discovered that there was only marginal evidence\nfor an improvement in quality if the Q2 cut was raised from 2 GeV2 to 3 GeV2 and no marked\nimprovement above this. There was a marked improvement in quality if W 2 is raised from our\nprevious cut of 10 GeV2 until we reach 12.5 GeV2, which may easily be interpreted as due to the\ninfluence of higher twist and\/or large ln(1\u2212x) terms in the perturbative expansion. Hence, for\nthe global fit presented below DIS data with Q2 > 2 GeV2 and W 2 > 12.5 GeV2 are included,\nin order to exclude regions where higher twist and\/or higher orders in \u03b1S are expected to play\nan important role. We also found that if a lower cut in x was introduced there was continual\nimprovement in the quality of the fit until x reached a value of about 0.005, suggesting that\nln(1\/x) terms in the perturbative series may be important. The results and consequences of\nthese cuts, particularly that in x, will be dealt with in a future paper [24], but for the present\nanalysis we take the conventional approach of not using any x cut and investigate\/suffer the\nconsequences.\nThe optimum global NLO fit is obtained with the starting parameterizations of the partons\nat Q20 = 1 GeV\n2 given by\nxuV = 0.158x\n0.25(1\u2212 x)3.33(1 + 5.61x0.5 + 55.49x) (2)\nxdV = 0.040x\n0.27(1\u2212 x)3.88(1 + 52.73x0.5 + 30.65x) (3)\n2\nxS = 0.222x\u22120.26(1\u2212 x)7.10(1 + 3.42x0.5 + 10.30x) (4)\nxg = 1.90x0.09(1\u2212 x)3.70(1 + 1.26x0.5 \u2212 1.43x)\u2212 0.21x\u22120.33(1\u2212 x)10. (5)\nThe flavour structure of the light quark sea is taken to be\n2u\u00af, 2d\u00af, 2s\u00af = 0.4S \u2212\u2206, 0.4S +\u2206, 0.2S (6)\nwith s = s\u00af, as implied by the NuTeV data [9], and where\nx\u2206 = x(d\u00af\u2212 u\u00af) = 1.195x1.24(1\u2212 x)9.10(1 + 14.05x\u2212 45.52x2) (7)\nThe masses of the quarks are taken to be mc = 1.43 GeV and mb = 4.3 GeV, the former\ngiving the best fit to the charm structure function data. The optimum fit corresponds to\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119, i.e. \u039bMS(nf = 4) = 323 MeV, in very good agreement with the world\naverage.3 We estimate the error in \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) due to the errors on the data fitted in the global\nanalysis to be about \u00b10.002, as will be explained in detail later. The resulting partons are\nshown in Fig. 1.\nThe improved HERA data greatly increase the constraints on the gluon at small x. The\nextra term in (5) is required to achieve an acceptable fit, and allows the starting gluon to\nbecome negative at small x. A fixed (1\u2212 x)10 behaviour is incorporated in this extra term so\nthat only the small x form of the gluon is affected. Not including this additional term, which\nallows the input gluon to be negative at small x, would lead to the input gluon being strongly\nvalence-like and to a global increase in \u03c72 of about 100. Note that only half this increase comes\nfrom the data points at very low x (say x < 0.001), the rest coming from the HERA and NMC\npoints in the region 0.001 < x < 0.1, as will be discussed in the next section. The gluon in the\npresent analysis becomes positive for all x > 10\u22125 and Q2 > 5 GeV2, and for Q2 > 2\u2212 3 GeV2\nfor x > 10\u22124. We note that while a negative gluon distribution may be slightly disturbing,\nthere is no real reason for worry since the gluon distribution is not a real physical quantity,\nparticularly in a somewhat unphysical factorization scheme such as MS. The implications for\nphysical quantities will be discussed in the next section.\nRecall that in the MRST99 analysis [27] the uncertainties in the gluon were illustrated\nby presenting the optimal fit g together with two fits g \u2191 and g \u2193, with larger and smaller\ngluons at large x, which represented the extremes of acceptable descriptions of the data. The\npresent analysis, with greatly improved data, significantly reduces the uncertainty in the gluon\ndistribution and yields an optimal solution with a large x gluon nearer to g \u2191 than to g. For this\nreason in Fig. 2 we compare the present partons with those of the g \u2191 set of MRST99 [27]. We\nsee that the major difference is in the gluon, or is a consequence of this changed gluon. First,\nwe note the extended parameterization for the gluon, required by the new HERA data, leads\nto a far smaller gluon at the lowest x and Q2. Since the quarks are determined by evolution\n3We use the matching between the nf - and nf+1-flavour couplings calculated in [25], and corrected in [26],\nup to NLO in \u03b1S . At this order the coupling is continuous across threshold but the derivative is discontinuous.\nMore details may be found in section 3 of the first of [23].\n3\ndriven by the gluon in this range, they are also smaller than their MRST99 counterparts. The\ngluon is also smaller in the range x \u223c 0.3 than that for MRST99(g \u2191) \u2014 the jet data requiring\nless gluon in this range than the prompt photon data with no intrinsic kT included. Both these\nreductions in the gluon allow for slightly more gluon in the range x \u223c 0.1, giving an increased\ndF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2 for x a little below this. The shape of the charm (and, to a lesser extent, the\nstrange) distribution simply follows the gluon since it is generated mainly by evolution from\nthe gluon. Finally we note that the down quark is slightly smaller at high x than in MRST99\ndue to the effect of the extra deuterium data included in the present fit, and as a consequence\nit is slightly larger for values of x in the region of 0.01.\n3 The description of the DIS data\nA good description of the HERA data is obtained, as can be seen from Figs. 3-6.4 Compared\nto MRST99, the curves for F2 are flatter in Q\n2 for x < 0.001, but slightly steeper at higher x.\nIn fact for 0.001 < x < 0.01 the data, particularly the high Q2 H1 and the NMC data, would\nprefer a higher dF2\/d lnQ\n2, as can be seen in Figs. 5 and 6, where the low Q2 NMC data is\nconsistently below the theory and the high Q2 H1 data is mostly above the theory. It appears\nas though the ZEUS data at high Q2 tend to lie below the H1 data, and are more consistent\nwith the fit. However, we note that the preliminary ZEUS 98-99 data for Q2 \u2265 200 GeV2 [28]\nseem to be more in line with the H1 data and prefer a steeper slope (i.e. they lie consistently\nabove MRST99 and hence would also be above MRST2001). The systematic failure in this\nregion of x is a cause for concern regarding the validity of an NLO fit. In fact we note that the\naforementioned improvement to the fit in this region, which comes from allowing the negative\ninput gluon at small x, is because this form allows there to be more gluon in the moderate\nx region (from the momentum sum rule), and hence a larger value of dF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2, as\npreferred by the data. We also note that although at the lowest x and Q2 our gluon distribution\nis considerably negative, dF2\/d lnQ\n2 is quite clearly positive. This highlights the fact that the\nfrequently quoted relationship dF2\/d lnQ\n2 \u221d \u03b1S(Q\n2)xg(x,Q2) is not even approximately true\nat small x and Q2 when one works beyond leading order in perturbative QCD. Qualitative\narguments about evidence for saturation etc. which rely on this relationship should be treated\nwith caution.\nThe fits to HERA data have been performed using the simplistic procedure of adding the\nsystematic and statistical errors in quadrature. However, we have actually performed an anal-\nysis of the effects of the correlated errors. To be specific we have first performed fits to the\ndata with only uncorrelated errors, then let the contributions of the correlated errors come\ninto effect, and finally iterated. We find that the absolute value of the \u03c72 using this procedure\n4Note that as in previous fits we have effectively fit the published cross section rather than F2(x,Q\n2) at the\nlarger values of Q2, i.e. we have corrected for our own values of FL(x,Q\n2) rather than use those obtained by\nthe fits by the experiments.\n4\nincreases for the ZEUS data, and stays more or less constant for the H1 data, but that some-\nwhat surprisingly the position of the minima and incremental changes in \u03c72 when comparing\ndifferent theoretical results stays much the same as when using the more simplistic addition\nin quadrature of all errors. Hence, we decide to present the simpler procedure in determining\nthe partons, and discuss details of the effects of correlated errors in an Appendix since the\nresults with full errors turn out to be an unnecessary complication. We do however let the\nZEUS normalization go to its lower limit of 98% in our fits in order to obtain the optimum\ndescription.\nThe comparison with the charm data [7, 29] can be seen5 in Fig. 7. As one can see it is\nof a perfectly acceptable quality, and the errors on this data are still large. There is, however,\na slight tendency to undershoot the data at the lowest values of x and Q2, and this may be\na sign of the need to improve the theoretical treatment in this region. In this region of low\nx and Q2 the prediction for the charm structure function is a little smaller than that for the\nMRST99 partons, which is entirely due to the smaller gluon we now find in this region. Finally\nwe note that the fit to the higher x EMC charm data [31] is very similar to that for the default\nset in Fig. 27 of [32] (the high x gluon is now a little larger, but mc is 1.43 GeV rather than\n1.35 GeV), and hence is perfectly acceptable.\nThe prediction for FL(x,Q\n2) is shown in Fig. 8, which also shows the prediction of the\nMRST99 partons. We see that the increased precision of the HERA data and the increased\nflexibility of the gluon parameterization have led to a significant decrease in the prediction for\nFL(x,Q\n2) at low x and Q2, replaced by a slight increase for x \u223c 0.05. Indeed, it now seems as\nthough FL(x,Q\n2) is taking a distinctly unphysical form for low x and Q2 < 5 GeV2, and for\npart of this range is negative, and therefore certainly disallowed.6 This is a direct consequence\nof the negative nature of the gluon distribution at small x and Q2, and may be taken as another\nclear sign that the standard NLO fit is not working completely properly at small x.7 As far as\nwe are aware FL(x,Q\n2) is the most direct probe of the gluon distribution at small x and Q2,\nand is the most appropriate quantity to examine in order to see the real pathological effects\nof the negative gluon distribution. F c2 (x,Q\n2) is less sensitive since at low Q2 the kinematic\nconstraint on charm production (W 2 \u2265 4m2c) means one is probing the gluon at higher x than\nfor FL(x,Q\n2), and as seen in Fig. 7, F c2 (x,Q\n2) is perfectly well behaved down to x < 0.0001.\nAt higher x the main change in our fit is due to the reanalysis of the CCFR data [8]. Their\nreanalysis no longer extracts F2(x,Q\n2) by modeling both FL(x,Q\n2) and \u2206xF3(x,Q\n2), but now\n5Updated charm data from the H1 collaboration have recently become available [30], but the results depend\non which Monte Carlo is used to extrapolate over the full range of phase space. Since these data are similar to\ntheir previous charm data [29], we show only the latter in Fig. 7.\n6In principle, it is internally inconsistent to fit to F2(x,Q\n2) data in a region where the predicted values of\nFL(x,Q\n2) are negative, namely x < 10\u22124 and Q2 >\u223c 2 GeV\n2. Since only 6 points are affected, carrying practically\nno weight in the fit, we do not remove these points.\n7We do not compare to the H1 extraction of FL(x,Q\n2) [33] since the different assumptions used in our fit\nlead to significantly different forms for the gluon and for \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), and hence different extrapolations into the\nhigh y region.\n5\nextracts either FL(x,Q\n2) or \u2206xF3(x,Q\n2) (there is a high degree of correlation between these)\nand F2(x,Q\n2) separately in a Physics Model Independent manner. This has gone a long way\ntowards resolving the apparent discrepancy between CCFR and NMC data on F2(x,Q\n2), where\nit had previously been impossible to simultaneously fit both for x < 0.1. The quality of the fit to\nthe new CCFR F2(x,Q\n2) data is shown in Fig. 9. Overall the fit is very good. One might argue\nthat there is still a systematic problem at the lowest Q2, but this is far less pronounced than\nwith previous analyses. There is also potentially a small error associated with the shadowing\ncorrections (details of which are found in [32]) which we do not account for. The reanalysis has\nalso established the validity of the previous F3(x,Q\n2) neutrino data. These data are essentially\nunaffected by the reanalysis, but we are now confident in using the data over the whole x range,\nrather than just for x \u2265 0.1. The fit is good over the whole range of x. Note that we normalize\nthe complete set of CCFR data up by 1% in order to obtain the best fit.\nOther than this, the other new DIS data (at least new for our fit) at high x are simply the\nSLAC and BCDMS deuterium data, which we have introduced for the first time. The fit to\nthese data is shown in Fig. 10. It is of a perfectly acceptable quality, and one can see that, as\nwith the proton data, the SLAC deuterium measurements prefer a rather steeper fall with Q2\nthan the BCDMS data, and consequently a larger \u03b1S. The SLAC data are normalized up by\n2.5% and the BCDMS down by 2%.\n4 Tevatron Jet Data and the Gluon\nOne of the major differences between the MRST2001 partons and our previous parton sets is\nthe manner in which the high ET Tevatron jets have been included. In the past [32] we have\nsimply checked that there is reasonable agreement with our predictions and the jet data. The\ndifficulties in using the prompt photon data in order to determine the high x gluon combined\nwith the considerable improvement in Tevatron jet data [5, 6] has led to a change in emphasis.\nBesides the increase in precision, the D0 jet data are available in a range of rapidity intervals\nand so constrain the partons, and the gluon in particular, over a much wider x range. We,\ntherefore, now include the D0 and CDF jet data in the global fit on an equal footing with\nall other data sets.8 However, because in this case the correlated systematic errors are the\ndominant source of error, being much larger than the uncorrelated errors, it is imperative to\ndeal with these in a correct manner. In fact we adopt the same method of fitting to the data as\ndo the respective experimental collaborations when describing their own data. Note, however,\nthat rather than using some NLO prescription such as JETRAD [35] or EKS [36] to generate\nan NLO correction for each point, we derive a smooth NLO K-factor by fitting to a set of such\npoints. Since the NLO corrections generated from the above programs have some error and\n8The D0 collaboration have recently produced data using the kT algorithm rather than the more usual cone\nalgorithm [34]. The agreement between the two methods is moderate, the major difference being at low ET .\nWe use the original data since we feel these have been more extensively studied, and because they also cover a\nmuch wider range in pseudo-rapidity.\n6\nscatter, this means that our value of \u03c72 will not be identical to that obtained by the experiments\nthemselves for the same parton set (though it will be very close). In particular our values of\n\u03c72 for the CDF1B jet data are a little higher, while for the D0 jet data they are slightly lower.\nWe find that for our best global fit we obtain a reasonable description of the combined jet\ndata with a \u03c72 of 170 for 113 points. The quality of the fits is shown in Figs. 11 and 12 \u2014 the\nerror bars account for uncorrelated errors alone. In both cases it is clear that while at the low\nET end the normalization is about correct, at higher ET (and rapidity) the theory lies below\nthe data. An acceptable fit is then obtained by accounting for the correlated systematic errors.\nFirst, for the CDF1B fit the (data\u2212theory) obtained is allowed to move by letting data\nmove relative to theory by application of each of the sources of correlated error, i.e. the \u03c72 is\nobtained from\n\u03c72 =\n\u2211\ni\n(Ti\/Fi \u2212 Ei)\n2\n(\u2206Ei)2\n+\n\u2211\nk\ns2k (8)\nwith\nFi = 1 +\n\u2211\nk\nfki sk, (9)\nwhere Ti is the theory prediction for data point i, Ei is the measurement with uncorrelated\nerror \u2206Ei, and f\nk\ni is the one-sigma correlated systematic error for point i from error source k.\nHence, the data and theory move relative to each other at the cost of an increase in \u03c72 of\n\u2211\nk s\n2\nk,\nwhere sk is the fraction of one-sigma which has been utilized for each error source.\n9 Hence in\nFig. 12 we see that the effect of introducing the error correlations Fi has been to bring down\nthe data at higher ET significantly in order to match the shape of the theory prediction. This\nlarge shift requires many of the sk to be of the order of 1, and for them all to conspire to move\nthe data in the same direction relative to the theory.\nFor the D0 jet data the fit is performed using the full error matrix, i.e.\n\u03c72 =\n\u2211\ni,j\n(Ei \u2212 Ti)[(Ti\/Ei)Cij(Tj\/Ej)]\n\u22121(Ej \u2212 Tj), (10)\nwhere Cij are the covariance matrix elements defined by\nCij =\n\u2211\nk\n\u03c1kij\u2206E\nk\ni \u2206E\nk\nj , (11)\nwhere k runs over all sources of error, \u2206Eki is the error of point i and \u03c1\nk\nij is the correlation\nbetween points i and j. This is actually a very similar way to obtain a \u03c72 to the previous\nmethod (see Appendix A of [6]). However, it accounts for the correlated systematic errors in a\nrather less transparent manner, though the good fit to the D0 jet data must clearly be obtained\nin much the same way. We illustrate the correlated errors in Fig. 11 simply by introducing a\nband with width given by adding each source of correlated error in quadrature. Although this\n9Since these correlated errors are expected to cut off rather more sharply than Gaussian errors we limit each\nsk to 1. This does not affect any results at all significantly.\n7\nis not as explicit as in Fig. 12, it indicates roughly how the data may move relative to the\ntheory without a large cost in \u03c72.\nAt the central value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) of 0.119, this global fit (including jet data) allows a variation\nin g(x,Q2) of about 5% for x > 0.1 and Q2 \u223c 2000 GeV2, which corresponds to 10 \u2212 15%\naccuracy for x > 0.1 and Q2 \u223c 20 GeV2. This is a factor of 3 or so less than the MRST99\nvariation of the gluon ranging from the g \u2191 to the g \u2193 gluon, and hence we do not provide\nparton sets with gluon extremes. Since the body of jet cross section data is (very roughly)\n\u221d \u03b1S(E\n2\nT \/4)g(x,ET\/2), then g(x, \u00b5\n2) for \u00b52 of order 103 GeV2 is roughly inversely proportional\nto \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). However, at high x the gluon distribution decreases more rapidly with increasing\nQ2, the larger the value of the coupling. This increase in speed of evolution with increasing \u03b1S\nmore than compensates for the decrease in the high-scale gluon required by the jets with \u03b1S,\nand for low Q2 (Q2 \u223c 10 GeV2) the high x gluon increases as \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) increases.\nWe note, however, that these optimum global fits are not the best possible fits to the high\nET jet data. The fit is only achieved by compensating for the smallness of the theory at high\njet ET and \u03b7 (both of which probe the highest x) using the correlated systematic errors. Hence,\nthe fit can be improved by an increase in the size of the high x gluon. In principle it is possible\nto obtain a fit with a \u03c72 of about 120 for the 113 points (see below) rather than \u03c72 = 170, the\nscatter of data points making this \u03c72 value about the lowest that is achievable. At the central\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) value of 0.119 it is possible to raise the high x gluon sufficiently to improve the quality\nof the jet fit to \u03c72 = 135, but only at the cost of \u2206\u03c72 = 60 for the rest of the data. This is\nmainly at the expense of the description of the moderate x DIS data, i.e. H1, ZEUS and NMC\ndata, since the increase of gluon at high x is countered by a decrease at intermediate x, and\nhence a decrease in dF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2. At lower \u03b1S the price is even higher since the lower \u03b1S\nalready impacts upon the behaviour of dF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2.\nHowever, as one goes to higher \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) the situation changes. At \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.121 one\ncan obtain a fit to the jet data with \u03c72 = 118, and where this improvement is only marginally\novercompensated by the deterioration in the rest of the fit compared to the best global fit.\nFor this set of partons, denoted by MRST2001J or simply J, the fit to the jet data is shown\nin Figs. 13 and 14. For the fit to the D0 data the shape is obviously greatly improved, both\nas a function of ET and of \u03b7, demonstrating that the apparent excess \u03c7\n2 in the description of\nthe Tevatron jet data is either a problem of parton distributions or of systematic errors, but is\nunlikely to be a sign of new physics. The normalization of the theory is a little high, but this\nis easily accounted for by the systematic error in normalization. The fit to the CDF1B data\nactually gives a slightly worse \u03c72 than before. But now the fit does not rely on a large shift\nof data due to systematic errors, and is perhaps more satisfactory in this sense. The problem\nwith this J set of partons is the behaviour of the gluon. The input form at Q20 = 1 GeV\n2 is\nxg = 123.5x1.16(1\u2212 x)4.69(1\u2212 3.57x0.5 + 3.41x)\u2212 0.038x\u22120.5(1\u2212 x)10, (12)\nwhich is shown in Fig. 15, together with the behaviour at Q2 = 20 GeV2. We see that the input\n8\nshape has a rather worrying \u201ckink\u201d which results in the distinct \u201cshoulder\u201d at Q2 = 20 GeV2.10\nWe do not deem this to be an acceptable gluon (admittedly a subjective decision), and rule\nthis fit out, although we do make the MRST2001J set of partons available. At \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.120\nwe obtain a similar result, i.e. the best overall fit gives about \u03c72 = 135 for the jet data, but\nhas a gluon with the same type of peculiarities (though less severe). Again we rule this fit out.\nHence, in our fits we impose the condition that d2(xg(x,Q20))\/dx\n2 does not change sign in the\nregion of high x which rules out the possibility of both kinks and shoulders in the high x gluon\ndistribution. Imposing this condition results in a fit to the jet data within the global fit which\nis roughly independent of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ).\n11\n5 Description of other data\nThe fit to much of the rest of the data is very much along the lines discussed in detail in\n[32]. The NuTev data [9] on single and double muon production do not qualitatively change\nthe conclusions regarding the strange contribution to the sea already indicated by the CCFR\ndimuon data [37], i.e. that the strange distribution is acceptably obtained from half the average\nof the u\u00af and d\u00af distributions atQ20 = 1 GeV\n2. Similarly the E866 collaboration [10] have provided\nnew data on the Drell-Yan asymmetry which is more accurate and extends the kinematic range\nslightly, but does not really change the relative u\u00af, d\u00af behaviour of the partons. In particular,\nour simple parameterization of d\u00af \u2212 u\u00af still suggests that (d\u00af\/u\u00af) \u2264 1 for x > 0.35, but there is\nno evidence whether this is really true or not. The lepton rapidity asymmetry data from CDF\n[17] (related to the W rapidity asymmetry) also continue to give us important information on\nthe u\/d ratio.\nFinally the E605 Drell-Yan data [16] still play an important role in pinning down the form\nof the sea quarks at high x. However, they also play an important and unexpected role in\ninfluencing the fit to the jet data and determining \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). As we will see below, the quality\nof the description of these data deteriorates as \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) increases. This is actually an indirect\neffect. As \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) increases, the high x gluon at lower Q\n2 increases so as to give the correct\ngluon normalization when evolved up to the scales appropriate for the description of the jet\ndata. This larger high x gluon (and larger \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ)) drives a positive evolution of the high\nx sea quarks. As this effect becomes more significant it distorts the shape of the sea quark\ndistribution in the range relevant for fitting Drell-Yan data, worsening the fit. Therefore the\nE605 data prefer lower value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) and a lower high x gluon. Indeed, for the MRST2001J\n10This seems to be made possible by the interplay between a very large coefficient for the first term in (12),\nthe large power of x, i.e. x1.16 in this term, and the extra effect of the second term controlling the very small\nx behaviour. This second term then effectively frees one parameter in the first term, which for previous parton\nsets represented the full parameterization of the input gluon, allowing more flexibility in the high x form of the\ngluon.\n11We note that a very good fit to the jet data could be achieved for \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) < 0.118 with a gluon without\npeculiarities, but that this results in a fit to the rest of the data which is very poor. This problem is improved,\nthough not completely rectified, when an x-cut is applied (see [24]).\n9\ntype partons the fit to the Drell-Yan data deteriorates quite seriously compared to the best\nglobal fit. Hence, these data have assumed a more important role in the context of the whole\nglobal fit than previously.\n6 Quality of Fit and Determination of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ).\nThe quality of the central fit for the major data sets is shown in Table 1 below. For each of\nthe smaller data sets, e.g. CDF W -asymmetry [17] and E866 Drell-Yan asymmetry [10], the\n\u03c72 per degree of freedom is about 1 per point. For all the DIS data sets the numbers are\nquoted for statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature. The quality of the fits to the\nindividual data sets is satisfactory. For the E605 data the systematic errors are quoted in a\nslightly ambiguous manner, and are generally subdominant, and so we fit to statistical errors\nalone. Hence, the quite large \u03c72 in this case. The treatment of the correlated systematic errors\nfor the Tevatron jet data has been discussed in Section 4.\nTable 1: Quality of the fit for MRST2001 partons to different data sets. The first MRST\ncolumn shows the \u03c72 values of the optimum fit with \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119. Also shown are the\nvalues for parton sets obtained from fits with \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.117 and 0.121, as well as those for\nparton set J which has structure in the high x gluon.\nData set No. of MRST MRST MRST MRST\ndata pts 0.117 0.121 J\nH1 ep 400 382 386 378 377\nZEUS ep 272 254 255 258 253\nBCDMS \u00b5p 167 193 182 208 183\nBCDMS \u00b5d 155 218 211 226 219\nNMC \u00b5p 126 134 143 127 135\nNMC \u00b5d 126 100 108 95 100\nSLAC ep 53 66 71 63 67\nSLAC ed 54 56 67 47 58\nE665 \u00b5p 53 51 50 52 51\nE665 \u00b5d 53 61 61 61 61\nCCFR F \u03bdN2 74 85 88 82 89\nCCFR F \u03bdN3 105 107 103 112 110\nNMC n\/p 156 155 155 153 161\nE605 DY 136 232 229 247 273\nTevatron Jets 113 170 168 167 118\nTotal 2097 2328 2346 2345 2337\n10\nThe way in which the quality of the fit to both the total and to each data set varies with\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) is shown in detail in Fig. 16. It must be remembered that the quality of the fit for a\nsingle data set within the context of a global fit is not the same thing as the quality of the fit\nfor that set alone, and many sets influence each other strongly. Nevertheless, one can pick out\nsome interesting facts from Fig. 16.\nFor the DIS data sets it is clear that only the two BCDMS sets strongly prefer lower values\nof \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). These are more than compensated by the SLAC and NMC data sets, which for\nboth proton and deuterium structure functions strongly prefer higher values of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). Both\nCCFR data sets are relatively insensitive to the value of the coupling, at least for 0.116 <\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) < 0.122. This also appears to be true for the H1 and ZEUS data sets. However, this\nlatter apparent insensitivity is due to the fact that the combined HERA data sets carry a lot of\nweight in the fit, and the gluon distribution at small x is largely determined by ensuring that\nthese data are fit well. This is therefore just a manifestation of the long-established fact that\nthe small x gluon and the value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) are completely correlated in fits to the HERA data,\nand without any additional handle on the gluon12 there is no way to remove this. It is clear\nfrom Fig. 16 that if one takes only BCDMS data as well as HERA data, as in the H1 analysis\n[3], one will determine a low value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), but taking SLAC or NMC as the additional set\na very different conclusion will be reached.\nThe combined Tevatron jet data behaves similarly to the HERA data, i.e. the gluon con-\nspires with \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) to give roughly the same \u03c7\n2 for all \u03b1S. Interestingly the jet data and HERA\ndata manage to conspire with each other so that the sum of their \u03c72 remains roughly constant.\nAs \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) increases the gluon at moderate Q\n2 and high x increases to maintain the fit to the\njet data. From the momentum sum rule this leaves less gluon at small x, but the larger \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ)\nmanages to keep the value of dF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2 acceptable. The fact that this trade-off be-\ntween HERA F2(x,Q\n2) data and Tevatron jet data results in almost complete insensitivity to\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) strikes us as remarkable. Note, however, that the constant total \u03c7\n2 for the jets is made\nup of a contribution from the CDF1B data which increases sharply with increasing \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ),\nand a rapidly falling contribution from the D0 jet data. In detail one finds that the general\nnormalization and shape of the theory compared to data improves with increasing \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ).\nThis leads to the improvement in the fit to D0 data. However, the precise shape of the CDF1B\ndata seems easiest to achieve by obtaining a poor comparison between theory and data which\nis then compensated for by quite large movements coming from the correlated errors. When\nthe shape and size is nearly correct to begin with this seems to leave less room for maneuver\nfor the correlated errors to produce exactly the correct shape (note that the \u03c72 is better in Fig.\n12 than in Fig. 14). Hence, if one is uncomfortable about letting the correlated errors conspire\nto move the data by a large amount the high \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) fits are better.\nFinally, as discussed in the last section, the E605 Drell-Yan data prefer a low value of\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). However, this is mainly due to the correlation between the value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) and the\nhigh x gluon brought about by the jet and HERA data.\n12The charm structure function is strongly correlated to the evolution of the total structure function, and\ntherefore does not provide an independent constraint.\n11\nPutting all the contributions together we obtain a total \u03c72 which has quite a sharp minimum\nat \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119. We then adjudge the error in this best value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), within the context\nof an NLO-in-\u03b1S fit, by letting the \u03c7\n2 increase by about 20 units. Clearly it is inappropriate\nto base the error on the increase of a single unit, for a variety of reasons. First, the treatment\nof the errors in this analysis is far from statistically rigorous, and even if it were, the errors\nthemselves are far from having a true Gaussian distribution. Also, we have made many decisions\nin performing this analysis, such as data cuts, the choice of parameterizations of partons, etc.\nChanging any of these and refitting would lead to changes in \u03c72 of about 5\u221210 for the remaining\ndata, and so our increase in \u03c72 should be at least this value . Making our choice of an increase\nof 20 we obtain \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119\u00b1 0.002(expt.). We see from Fig. 16 that beyond these limits\nthe global \u03c72 increases very quickly.13\nThus, we present our determination of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) as\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.1190 \u00b1 0.002(expt.) \u00b1 0.003(theory). (13)\nWe do not adopt the traditional, but ad hoc, manner of obtaining the theoretical error by\nvarying renormalization and factorization scales up and down by factors of 2 (or of 4). This\ntakes no account of the errors attributable to higher order logarithmic enhancements. For\nexample, in DIS there are additional logarithms in (1\u2212x) and 1\/x in the coefficient functions and\nsplitting functions at higher orders in \u03b1S which variations in scale tell us nothing about. Similar\nlogarithmic enhancements also exist for the other quantities fitted, such as data near threshold.\nHence, we obtain our theory error by comparing with alternative theoretical treatments which\ndo tell us something more concrete about the missing corrections, i.e. approximate NNLO fits\ne.g. [38], or fits which attempt a resummation of ln(1\/x) and ln(1 \u2212 x) terms [39]. These\nsuggest that 0.003 is an appropriate theoretical error.14\nAs regards the errors on the partons themselves, in a separate study we will present the\nuncertainties in the predictions of key observables, and show how they reflect the uncertainties\non the parton distributions. An example of this is seen in [40]. However, as in the case of\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), we believe the theoretical errors to be generally more important than the experimental\nerrors, particularly in some regions of parameter space.\n7 Conclusions\nIn this paper we have performed global analyses of all the most up-to-date data on deep inelastic\nscattering and related processes in order to best determine the parton distributions and the\n13We have also investigated the fits without the Tevatron jet data included. Even though removing this\nconstraint allows gluons to migrate to lower x and in principle fit the HERA data with lower \u03b1S , the overall\nimpact on the global fit is not large. The minimum moves down by \u2206\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) \u223c 0.0002. For rather low values\nof \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), e.g. 0.116 or lower, the removal of the high x gluon constraint does allow an improvement in the\nfit to HERA and NMC data, but at this value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) the global fit has become much worse anyway, and\nall one would obtain with jet data removed would be a shape for the total \u03c72 like that in Fig. 16, but with the\nslope on the left-hand side a little more shallow.\n14These investigations suggest that \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) might move down slightly from 0.119.\n12\nvalue of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) within the context of a conventional NLO fit. This is an improvement on\nour previous analyses mainly because of some very important new sets of data. In particular\nthe new HERA data [1, 2, 3, 4] are far more precise than previously and cover an extended\nrange in x and Q2. Also the new D0 and CDF Tevatron jet data are again more precise,\nwith systematic errors which are better understood, and which extend their previous kinematic\nranges. These new HERA and Tevatron data sets together impose far more stringent limits\non the parton distributions than ever before. We also obtain a tight constraint on the value\nof \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). Our best overall fit corresponds to \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119, and investigating variations\nabout this minimum we obtain \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119\u00b1 0.002(expt.)\u00b1 0.003(theory). The quality of\nthe fits for the two experimental limits of 0.117 and 0.121 can be seen in Fig. 16, and are also\ndetailed in Table 1.\nThe new data sets have a particularly strong impact on the gluon distribution. In order to\nfit the new HERA data well we have been forced into an extension of our previous input gluon\nparameterization, allowing it to become negative at small x. Indeed at Q20 = 1 GeV\n2 it behaves\nlike xg(x,Q20) \u223c 0.2x\n\u22120.33 for x < 0.001, and this is necessary not only to obtain a good fit at\nlow x and Q2, but also to allow enough gluon at higher x to obtain large enough (dF2\/d lnQ\n2)\nfor x \u223c 0.01, and enough gluon at large x for the Tevatron jets. As \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) increases the\nvery small x gluon becomes more negative. This is due to a combination of factors, i.e. the\nchange of gluon needed by the jets at high x and by (dF2\/d lnQ\n2) at medium x, but the most\nobvious explanation is that as \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) increases the positive effect of the quark-gluon splitting\nfunction at very small x increases (particularly the NLO contribution), and the gluon in this\nregion correspondingly decreases. The result of a negative gluon at low Q2 and x has been\nconfirmed by backwards evolution in [21] (and to a lesser extent in [3]). It will be interesting to\nsee whether a similar conclusion is obtained by other analyses [41, 42]. We anticipate that the\nevolution from positive definite parton distributions at very low scales [42] will be very difficult\nto sustain.\nThe Tevatron jet data constrain the high x gluon (though from the momentum sum rule\nand convolutions performed in evolution equations it also affects lower x). These provide a far\nbetter constraint than any previous data, and from the best global fit we now estimate the\nuncertainty in the gluon distribution for x > 0.1 and Q2 \u223c 20 GeV2 to be 10 \u2212 15%, with\nthe error decreasing with increasing Q2. This removes the need to produce the sets of parton\ndistributions with extreme gluons that were presented in the MRST98 [32] and MRST99 [27]\nanalyses. There is, however, the caveat that if we were to allow the input gluon to have a rather\nunusual shape and also let \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) be \u2265 0.120 we can produce a fit which is much better for\nthe jet data, without too great an expense in \u03c72 for the rest of the data. The best possible jet\nfit is obtained for \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.121, and the parton set is denoted by MRST2001J. The gluon\nis shown in Fig. 15, and the quality of the fit using this set of partons is shown in Table 1. We\nsee that the total \u03c72 is not much higher than the central fit, and is better than the nominal fit\nfor \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.121. In particular the large high x gluon helps to counter the deterioration in\nthe fit to BCDMS data for increasing coupling, but has a poor effect on the Drell-Yan E605\ndata (as discussed in Section 5). However, we reject this as an acceptable set because of the\n13\nTable 2: Predictions in nb for W and Z production at the Tevatron and LHC, compared with\nthose of MRST99 [27].\nMRST99 MRST2001\nTevatron B\u2113\u03bd \u00b7 \u03c3W 2.45 2.48\nB\u2113+\u2113\u2212 \u00b7 \u03c3Z 0.226 0.228\nLHC B\u2113\u03bd \u00b7 \u03c3W 20.3 20.5\nB\u2113+\u2113\u2212 \u00b7 \u03c3Z 1.87 1.89\nstructure in the form of the high x gluon at low scales, but make it available as an alternative\nset. It is in some senses similar to the CTEQHJ parton set [43] obtained by forcing the best fits\nto previous high ET jet data, but does not seem to have quite the same features and moreover,\nwe find that our very good fit to jet data can only be achieved without a huge cost in \u03c72 to the\nfit to other data for \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) > 0.120.\nOther than the gluon, and the heavy quark distributions which are generated entirely by\nevolution and mainly from the gluon, there are no really dramatic changes in our parton\ndistributions, as can be seen in Fig. 2. The inclusion of more deuterium data has caused\na slight decrease in the high x down quark distribution, and a corresponding increase for\nx \u223c 10\u22122, but there is nothing else too significant. Indeed, our central value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) has not\nchanged much either. Though the changes are small, it is important to quantify their influence\non the precision predictions of the W and Z production cross sections at the LHC and the\nTevatron. Table 2 shows the changes in the predictions for these cross sections when going\nfrom the default MRST99 parton set [27] to the present set where, for ease of comparison, we\nhave kept the electroweak parameters unchanged. We see that the predicted cross sections have\nincreased by about 1%. This is partly caused by the increase in the down quark distribution\nin the relevant (x,Q2) range, see the second plot in Fig. 2. The uncertainty of such predictions\nand the influence on the parton uncertainty will be the subject of a future paper.\nAs a final point we note that the overall quality of the NLO-in-\u03b1S fit remains fairly good.\nThe raised cut in W 2, from 10 GeV2 to 12.5 GeV2 has removed some deficiencies in the high\nx slope which may be due to higher twist or higher orders in \u03b1S(Q\n2). Also, it is noticed that\ninvestigating cuts in Q2 implies little evidence for higher twist at general x. However, some of\nthe previous areas of concern have been increased rather than reduced. It is a worrying point\nthat the minimum \u03c72 values for many individual data sets within the global fit (Fig. 16) lie\noutside the range \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.116\u22120.122. Also, as in previous fits, there is also still a struggle\nto get a steep enough evolution of F2(x,Q\n2) in the region x \u223c 0.01 as is seen in Figs. 5 and\n6. Moreover, it is also difficult to obtain enough high x gluon to get a very good fit to the\njet data. These two points, coupled with the rather slow evolution of F2(x,Q\n2) at the lowest\nx, combine to produce a gluon which has gone from being valence-like to very negative at the\ninput scale Q20 = 1 GeV\n2. While this is not necessarily a problem in itself, it has resulted in\n14\na prediction for FL(x,Q\n2) that is worryingly small at very small x (Fig. 8). Hence there are\nimplications of problems at small x. We have not really considered the effect of a lower x cut\nin this paper, but will demonstrate in a future paper [24] that investigating fits with low x data\ncut out does have a serious effect on the partons and has strong implications on the real success\nof the standard NLO-in-\u03b1S fit at low x. Remember that in the same way that the high x form\nof the gluon imposed by jet data influences small x via the sum rule and convolutions, cutting\nout small x data can influence the fit and partons at higher x. However, the effect of varying\nthe x cut on the value of \u03b1S is minimal, since the major constraint comes from the evolution\nof the high x partons. It is, therefore, not surprising that the value remains well within our\nquoted experimental error, 0.119 \u00b1 0.002. On a related point we have already noticed that\nextending the theory to (an approximate) NNLO-in-\u03b1S does lead to a general improvement in\nthe quality of the fit, and to some significant changes in partons and predictions, particularly\nat small x. We have not considered NNLO at all here, but will produce detailed results in a\nforthcoming paper [38].\nIn summary, in this paper we have used all deep inelastic and hadron collider data available\nin order to obtain the most accurate and precise determination of the NLO parton distributions\ncurrently in existence, and have also determined the value of the strong coupling constant\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) with tight constraints. This enables us to probe the success of the conventional NLO\nperturbative QCD framework in describing hadronic collider physics, and we find that overall\nit is still working well. This then provides us with the necessary starting point for predicting\nand explaining new physics coming from present and future particle colliders.\nThe FORTRAN code for the four NLO parton sets mentioned in Table 1 can be found at\nhttp:\/\/durpdg.dur.ac.uk\/hepdata\/mrs\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Levan Babukhadia, Iain Bertram, Anwar Bhati, Arie Bodek, John\nCollins, Mandy Cooper-Sarkar, Brenna Flaugher, Brian Foster, Nigel Glover, Eram Rizvi, Olaf\nRuske, Neils Tuning, Andreas Vogt, Rainer Wallny, Un-ki Yang and Rik Yoshida for useful\ndiscussions and information concerning the data.

In order to do this we have adopted the same\n15\nprocedure as for the CDF jet data, i.e. in order to obtain the \u03c72 we use (8), which is also the\nprocedure usually adopted by the H1 collaboration. As before we limit the size of each of the\nsk to be \u2264 1, though again this has little effect.\nLet us discuss the fit to the ZEUS data first, since this is particularly simple. If we take\nour default fit and compare to the ZEUS data with uncorrelated errors only, we obtain a \u03c72\nof 378 for the 242 points in [4]. If we keep the theory fixed and let the sk for the sources of\ncorrelated errors vary then \u03c72 lowers to 331. The way in which it does this is very simple \u2013 the\nmajority of the data normalizes down to its minimum of 98%, while that below Q2 = 27 GeV2\ntakes its normalization down the further available 1%. This seems to be essentially in order to\nbring the data into line with the H1 normalization (which matches well with that of the NMC\ndata). All further changes are a very minor perturbation to this. Those error sources which\ncould alter the shape, such as the positron energy scale and hadronic energy flow labeled type\nB, play no part, presumably because they would cause dramatic alterations in a few bins which\nwould only lead to a deterioration of the fit.\nThe effect for H1 data is a little more complicated. The default fit using uncorrelated errors\nalone gives a \u03c72 of 485 for the 400 points. If we let the sk for the sources of correlated errors vary,\nthen \u03c72 lowers to 381. This comes from 3 sources. Some of the low x and Q2 points move up\n\u223c 2%, coming closer to the ZEUS data. Some of the highest x points use their large correlated\nerrors to move up 5\u221210% since they clearly fell below theory (and the extrapolation of BCDMS\ndata). Finally, the biggest improvement comes from the region 0.001 < x < 0.08, where the low\nQ2 points move up by up to 3%, and the high Q2 points minimize their normalization to move\ndown by 2 \u2212 3%. These effects combine to flatten the slope with Q2 at fixed x and partially\nreconcile the data with the failure of the theory to have a large enough dF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2 in\nthis range of x.\nThus the data shift from their central values to partially account for either the incompat-\nibility between H1 and ZEUS data, or between data and theory. If the data are then moved\nfrom their central values to those imposed by the correlated systematic errors and the fit redone\nthere is to all intents and purposes no change in either \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) or the partons, i.e the iteration\nessentially converges at the first step. To be precise, the value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) for the best fit moves\nby less than 0.0003, the quark distributions change by less than 0.5% at all x and Q2, and\nthe gluon distribution changes by a maximum of 1.5% at Q2 \u223c 2 GeV2, lowering to 1% at\nQ2 = 5 GeV2 and 0.5% at Q2 > 20 GeV2.15 Hence, the correlated systematic errors simply\nallow the data to readjust themselves to best match the possible theory and other data sets, but\nrather surprisingly the parameters in the theory do not alter at all significantly to rematch the\naltered data. We summarize the major effects. First, the normalization change of the ZEUS\nmeasurements, and of low Q2, low x H1 measurements brings the data sets closer together, but\ndoes not change the best fit, which is a still a compromise between them. Second,the raising of\n15The percentage change in the gluon distribution is large at low Q2 in the precise region of x where the gluon\ndistribution becomes negative, but this is just due to the change in sign of the gluon here, and the absolute\nchange is extremely small.\n16\nthe high x H1 data improves its description, but these data carry virtually no weight compared\nto NMC, BCDMS and SLAC data. Finally, the flattening of the intermediate x data in Q2\nagain improves the fit quality, but dF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2 is still too flat for these data even after\nthe alteration, and also for NMC data, so the pull on the fit is only partly diminished.\nIn fact we also notice that the increments in \u03c72 between different fits are very similar\nwhen the correlated systematic errors are used in full to when the simple addition in quadra-\nture of statistical and systematic errors is used. This can be seen by examining the fits for\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.116 to \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.122 using the iterative procedure described above. We find\nthat although the base points of the curves for HERA data in the bottom right plot in Fig. 16\nmove (significantly for ZEUS), the shape and scale of the curves is extremely similar to those\nshown \u2013 there is a very slight tendency for the low \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) \u03c7\n2 to be lower and the high \u03b1s(M\n2\nZ)\n\u03c72 to be higher, but only by a couple of units. The refit in the second stage of the iteration\nresults in the \u03c72 for other data sets changing, but only by a couple of points each, and in such\na way that the total change for non-HERA data is only a couple of points in total. Hence,\nthe curve for the total \u03c72 in the top left of Fig. 16 is changed by at most 3\u20134 units at each\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), except for the common shift, and all conclusions on parton distributions for the best\nfit and uncertainty of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) are unaltered. We have also examined more significant changes\nin theory curves by comparing to a theoretical model designed to work better at small x. In\nthis case the fit to H1 data gives a better description of dF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2, with a \u03c72 of 420, if\nuncorrelated errors alone are used. When correlated errors are allowed to contribute, no large\ncorrection is needed for intermediate x so the improvement is of 420 \u2212 81 = 339 compared\nto 485 \u2212 104 = 381 above. In both cases the final \u03c72 values are within a 3\u20134 units of that\nobtained from the simplistic procedure. For ZEUS data the model gives a \u03c72 value 18 worse for\nquadrature, and 23 worse for the full treatment of errors, and in this case the increment when\nstatistical errors alone are used is much the same.\nHence, the freedom of the data to move in the direction of preferred theory or other data\nwhen correlated systematic errors are properly accounted for lessens the pull on a fit compared\nto the use of uncorrelated errors alone, but for the present HERA data this seems to have a\nrather similar effect to the lessening of the pull obtained by adding statistical and systematic\nerrors in quadrature. The relative success of this approximation is presumably due to the fact\nthat for the vast majority of the data points the uncorrelated error is easily dominant, and\ncorrelated shifts in the data are rather smaller than the uncorrelated errors of most points.\nThis is in contrast to the Tevatron jet data where, as we see in Fig. 12, the correlated shift can\nbe an order of magnitude greater than the uncorrelated error of some points. Therefore, in our\ndetermination of the best fits, and the variations about these, we use the simple prescription\nfor errors for the HERA data, since it does not lead to unnecessary complications, and does\nnot change any results to any significant degree, as quantified above.\n17\nReferences\n[1] H1 Collaboration: C.
