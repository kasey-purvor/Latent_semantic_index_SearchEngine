Introduction\nConsumption or, more precisely, over-consumption, is a major driver of global environmental change\n(Princen, 1999). Faced with rising demands and increasing supply uncertainty there is a pressing need\nto engage governments, water utilities and the public on water conservation issues if future water\nshortages and environmental problems are to be avoided. Human drivers of increasing household and\nper capita water consumption include population growth (EEA, 2001; Ofwat 2000a), higher household\nnumbers (Ofwat, 2000a; AWWArf, 2001), lower household occupancy (Mitchell, 2001; Ofwat, 2000a),\nand lifestyle changes related to technology, personal habits and affluence (Princen, 1999; EEA, 2001).\nWhilst human consumption is increasing, water availability is becoming more variable due to climate\nchange and is forecast to decrease in many regions in the future (IPCC, 2001).\nUp until recently the main solution to addressing water shortages was to exploit new sources of supply.\nThe growing consensus that reducing human demand is a more sustainable method of addressing the\nimbalance between supply and demand has led researchers (see Michelson et al, 1999; Renwick and\nArchibald, 1998; Maddaus, 2001; Howarth and Butler, 2004) and environmental organisations (UK\nEnvironment Agency, 1997; USEPA, 2002; Read, 2005); to recommend that municipal and private\nwater utilities adopt an Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) approach in which Demand-\nSide Management (DSM) options are employed in conjunction with conventional supply activities to\naddress water shortages.\nIWRM involves consideration of the cumulative impacts of all activities within a watershed in an effort\nto maintain overall watershed health. The licensing of municipal water withdrawals and wastewater\ndischarges is considered alongside other activities in the watershed, such as intakes and outflows of\nother municipalities\u2019 water systems as well as land and resource uses such as agriculture and forestry\n(Shrubsole and Mitchell, 1997). The immediate contribution of residential DSM to IWRM is to\nincrease the supply headroom to all sectors.\nSuccessful implementation of DSM tools requires commitment from the local water utility and its\ncustomers (Howarth, 1999; Gumbo and Zaag, 2002) as well as the required political will and leadership\nfrom governments (Read, 2005; Gumbo, 2004; Howarth, 1999) to generate consensus and provide\n5suitable legislation. However, it has been pointed out (Read, 2005; Howarth, 1999) that there has been\na lack of willingness to participate in DSM by some stakeholders causing difficulty in providing the\nnecessary coverage. This raises the question: if over-consumption is such an issue, why is there such\nhesitation in implementing DSM measures? It should be pointed out that the recommendation that\nDSM is a more sustainable approach to managing the imbalance between supply and demand should be\nseen in the context of identifying the point at which it becomes more efficient to shift from water\nresource reinforcement to a demand management approach (Green, 2003). This decision is often\ncomplicated by a number of factors such as the water pricing mechanism used, and the difficulty in\nquantifying the value of leaving water in the environment.\nThere has been sparse coverage of advances in the application of DSM tools in the academic literature\nin recent years (UK Environment Agency, 2005). A number of important DSM studies have recently\nbeen reported on by non-academic institutions, and there is a need for a comprehensive, up to date\nreview of the impacts of different DSM tools and the factors which influence their effectiveness. This\npaper will begin to address the apparent lack of coverage with a contemporary review of advances in\nthe application of residential DSM tools. Recent reports of DSM campaigns in different countries, with\nthe focus on countries in the western, developed-world are reviewed in order to understand the\npotential contribution of residential DSM tools to conserve water in different types of household under\nvarying conditions and identify influences on implementation effectiveness. The current review will be\nof interest to, among others, water company professionals, policy makers, regulators and environmental\nagencies.\nThe following discussion of the differences in context (i.e. Europe, USA, and Australia) will help the\nreader appreciate better the relative character of the results reported in this paper, particularly where\nresults are reported as a percentage of total consumption.\nWater consumption in litres per capita per day (l\/c\/d) for the focus regions are presented in Table 1\n(below). There is a significant difference between average per capita consumption, with the highest\nreported in Australia (503 l\/c\/d), followed by the USA (409 l\/c\/d), and Europe (170 l\/c\/d).\n6[Insert Table 1 here]\nIndoor and outdoor water consumption in Australia, USA, and European countries, disaggregated by\nmicro-component, is presented in Table 2. The most noticeable difference is the high level of outdoor\nconsumption in the USA and Australia.\n[Insert Table 2 here]\nThe relative difference the outdoor component demand is the major factor that explains the higher total\ndemand in Australia and the USA in Table 1. This difference, along with other factors such as the\nefficiency of existing indoor fittings, will determine to some extent the water saving potential of the\ndifferent DSM tools referred to in this report.\n2. Current state of knowledge on the effectiveness of various DSM tools\nDSM campaigns usually involve co-implementation of several DSM tools which can be separated into\nfive categories; technological, financial, legislative, operation & maintenance, and educational. In order\nto distinguish the water saving potential for individual DSM tools on water consumption, data requires\na high level of disaggregation (i.e. individual indoor and outdoor components) (Michelson et al, 1999;\nRenwick and Green, 2000; Turner et al, 2004). A control sample is desirable in order to understand\nrelative savings (Turner et al, 2004) because absolute savings in any one year will not prove useful as\nthey do not account for other factors such as climate variables or restrictions which can significantly\nchange household demand from year to year.\nA number of DSM campaigns and controlled studies selected on the criteria that they disaggregate\nrelative savings of different DSM tools are reported on below using the five DSM tool categories.\n2.1 Financial tools\n7The use of financial tools as a DSM mechanism requires that water use is measured on a per unit basis\nwhich requires the installation of a water meter. A number of reported impacts on water demand\nfollowing meter installation are reported on below, followed by a discussion of pricing effectiveness\nand the different application of financial tools. Some of the synergistic relationships between pricing\nand metering and non-price measures are in discussed in more detail in Section 4.2.\n2.1.1. Metering. Metering water consumption and charging on a per unit basis produces a water bill\nthat varies with the amount of water used, signalling in the mind of the consumer the value of clean\nwater. Meter installation is therefore important if water utilities intend to implement water conservation\npricing. The findings from a number of studies of household metering in Europe and the United States\nare shown in Table 1.\n[Insert Table 1 about here].\nThe processes by which household meter installation causes lower residential water demand are not\nfully understood, and are likely to be due to effects other than meter installation alone. This observation\nis based on the assumption that secretly installing a meter in a pipe entering a person\u2019s house will have\nno affect on their behaviour (Thornton, 2002).\nThe mean reported savings from US programs (see Table 1) is 20 percent. Two separate studies\n(Maddaus, 2001; Linaweaver et al, 1966) found that metering has a significant impact on outdoor\ndemand and a significantly lower impact on indoor demand. The study by Maddaus (2001) in\nCalifornia revealed that in the first year, metering led to an 18.9 percent reduction in residential water\ndemand between 1997 and 1998, but only an 8.7% reduction between 1997 and 1999 indicating that\nwater demand rebounded after the initial impact of metering. Her study also found that savings due to\nmetering correlated positively with an increase in plot size. Savings from meter installation may also be\ncoincidental. Mean savings from UK reports indicate a 14 percent reduction in demand with a wide\nvariation between different areas due to seasonal demand fluctuations during the monitoring period,\nimplementation of water use restrictions, and reductions in household and network leakage (Ofwat,\n2002).\n8In addition to metering single occupancy houses, many multi-family dwelling units in the United States\nare converting to systems where each multi-family dwelling unit pays for water and wastewater\nservices directly instead of including these charges as part of the rent. A comprehensive survey of over\n10,000 multi-family residences in the United States showed that submetering and a price increase led to\na 15.6% reduction (83 litres\/capita\/day) in per capita demand (Mayer et al, 2004). However, concerns\nregarding the equity of this approach have been raised because multifamily households are often\nassociated with low-income residents (AWWArf, 2001).\n2.1.2. Pricing. As already pointed out, metering water consumption and charging on a per unit basis\nproduces a water bill that varies with the amount of water used, signalling in the mind of the consumer\nthe value of clean water. The reliability of price incentives in reducing demand, at least in the short-\nterm, compared to the uncertainty of other DSM options, has been cited as one of their main strengths\n(Campbell et al, 2004) as a conservation measure. However, research which shows water demand to be\nrelatively price inelastic (Espey et al, 1997; Renwick and Archibald, 1998), reports which indicate the\nlack of persistence of price mechanism (i.e. rebounding to the same or even higher levels following an\ninitial decrease) (Maddaus, 2001; Alitchkov and Kostava, 1996; Kanakoudis, 2002) and concerns about\nequity and the opposing motivation of raising prices (i.e. profit or DSM) (Duke et al, 2002; Howarth\nand Butler, 2004), have led many to question the efficiency and sustainability of using water price as a\nmethod of reducing water demand.\nFrom an efficiency standpoint, the (metered) per unit water price should reflect the marginal cost of\nwater (i.e. the change in cost per unit change in quantity sold) (AWWArf, 2001). Marginal cost pricing\nfirst emerged in the United States in the electrical industry during the 1970s and 1980s. Where\nmarginal price structures were used in this early period (and also in some current cases) they set aside\nthe sole, narrow focus of meeting the utility\u2019s revenue requirements in favour of a broader set of goals\nthat also include economic efficiency and the promotion of conservation (Baumann et al, 1998). Whilst\neconomists generally advocate residential water prices that reflect marginal costs as a means of\nreducing demand during periods of limited water supply availability, others argue that residential\ndemand is only price elastic up to a certain point and thus price is a relatively ineffective DSM\n9mechanism. This argument rests on both economic theory and empirical evidence (Dalhuisen et al,\n2003; Espey et al, 1997; Chestnutt and McSpadden, 1991).\nDespite the general findings that residential water demand is relatively price inelastic, disaggregated\nprice elasticities for different regions and different income groups show significant variations.\nDalhuisen et al (2003) studied 64 separate regions in Europe and the United States deriving 314\ninstances of price elasticity, providing one of the most comprehensive studies to date. They showed\nthat price elasticities vary between regions. In Europe price elasticities averaged -0.28, in the Eastern\nUnited States -0.005, and in the Western United States they averaged -0.17. A separate study in\nAustralia (Dandy et al, 1997) found that the price elasticity range was reported between -0.60 and -\n0.80. Price elasticities have been shown to be highly sensitive to temperature and the regional tariff\nstructure. The magnitude of price elasticity is expected to increase in regions with higher incomes\n(Dalhuisen et al, 2003). In the UK it has been reported that middle income families\u2019 water consumption\nis more responsive to a per unit price rise than that of high income families and low income families\n(UKWIR, 1996). This can be explained by the fact that prior to metering low-income families in the\nUK are already only using enough water to fulfil basic needs so could not substantially reduce their\nconsumption, whereas the price signal for more affluent groups is not sufficiently strong to reduce\ndemand as it is for the middle income groups.\nOther research has concluded that outdoor water use is more price elastic than indoor water use\n(Bruvold and Smith, 1988; Renwick and Archibald, 1998). A recent study of eight water municipalities\nin California has shown that aggregate demand was 25% more price responsive in the summer months,\nreflecting the more discretionary nature of outdoor water use (Renwick and Green, 2000). Renwick and\nArchibald (1998) found that low-income families in Santa Barbara are more responsive to price and\nthat households on larger parcels of land had larger quantity reductions under scarcity pricing. Higher\nrelative outdoor water use in the USA compared to the UK is the most likely reason for low-income\nfamilies in the USA being able to respond to price signals.\n2.1.3 Pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of different tariff structures. The use of marginal pricing may serve the\npurposes of efficiently meeting the costs of supplying water but not the aim of providing incentives for\n10\nefficient use. The method by which changes in price are implemented (e.g. seasonal variations or step\nchanges due to volume used) have an impact on the effectiveness of pricing strategies. Such pricing\nstructures are suitably referred to as conservation pricing (e.g. increasing block rates or seasonal rates)\nbecause they send an amplified price signal to consumers to conserve water. To be most effective,\nEspey et al (1997) recommend that pricing structures need to be designed in such a way that\ndiscretionary water use in summer months is targeted. Reports detailing the implementation of different\npricing structures indicate that moving from a uniform to increasing block structure can significantly\nimpact on demand (USEPA, 1998 in UK Environment Agency, 1997). An increasing block price based\non per capita consumption (rather than per household consumption) has recently been shown to\neffectively meet the objectives of both affordability and efficiency (Liu et al, 2003). Although this\napproach has shown potential within an experimental group it is yet to be reported on in a fully\nimplemented water pricing program.\nA problem experienced when moving from a uniform to increasing block structure it often increases\nrevenue instability leading to affordability problems for the utility itself (Day, 1993; Renwick and\nArchibald, 1998; Baumann et al, 1998, AWWArf, 2001). For example, in 1990, following the\nintroduction of an increasing block rate structure in the previous year, the town of Goleta in California,\nwhich suffered severe water shortages in the mid-late 1980s, moved to a relatively high uniform rate to\nstabilise water revenues. This was mainly due to the effects of the previous increasing block rate\nstructure, but was also partly as a response to the financial burden of a previously implemented toilet\nrebate program raising questions about whether the use of an increasing block tariff combined with\nimposed cost of implementing technological DSM tools may increase the risk of financial insecurity for\nthe water utility.\nAs already mentioned, in some regions lower-income households are less able to reduce water demand\ndue to low outdoor water consumption, and furthermore are less able to bare the financial burden of\nhigh water prices. In summary, from the review of literature on this issue, we observe that water price\nelasticity varies down to the most disaggregated level (i.e. the individual), but overall, compared to\nother goods, water is relatively price inelastic and therefore requires significant price increases to have\na major impact on demand. For these reasons, if price mechanisms are to be used as a water\n11\nconservation tool, there is a need for permanent surveys and observations to monitor the paying\ncapacity (and incapacity) of different social groups.\n2.2. Technological tools\n2.2.1. Indoor water use. The following table (Table 2) shows reported savings from DSM programs\ninvolving the installation of water efficient household appliances in different countries. The majority of\nthese come from studies in the USA and Australia where household retrofit programs have been most\nwidely implemented and reported on. The \u2018retrofit\u2019 column in Table 2 refers to programs involving the\ninstallation of what can be considered temporary measures such as toilet dams, faucet aerators, low-\nflow shower heads etc, whereas the other columns show where water appliances have been\npermanently replaced. The data indicates that \u2018retrofit\u2019 programs can reduce indoor water consumption\nby between 9-12 percent whilst comprehensive replacement of household appliances with more highly\nefficient appliances can reduce indoor water consumption by between 35-50 percent.\nAchieved water savings from technology vary for a number of reasons. Predictably, they vary due to\nhousehold appliance water use rate before and after refitting. Figure 1 shows savings for different\nhousehold appliances as a percentage of total indoor water use from research in three US cities by\nMayer et al (2000; 2003; 2004b). Their research indicates that toilet and clothes washer replacement\noffers the greatest water saving potential for indoor appliances. In order to understand the potential for\nhousehold retrofits to reduce indoor water consumption, micro-component water use data was obtained\nfrom a sample of homes in the three cities studies; Seattle - 37 homes (Mayer et al, 2000), San\nFrancisco - 33 homes (Mayer et al, 2003), Tampa - 30 homes (Mayer et al, 2004b). The homes were\nretrofitted with high efficiency toilets, clothes washers, showerheads, and faucets.\n12\n[Insert Table 2 about here].\n[Insert Figure 1. about here].\nOne of the most important findings from the three studies by Mayer et al (2000; 2003; 2004b) is that\nleakage, which was mainly caused by faulty toilet valves, accounted for the majority of savings in the\nTampa (20.2%) and San Francisco (19.8%) retrofits, but significantly less for the Seattle program\n(6.6%). This was due to differences in the initial level of leakage in the different municipalities which\nwere 29.7%, 24.3%, and 10.4% respectively.\nThe importance of toilet leakage for water saving potential has also been pointed out in reports of\nretrofit programs in New York (Ostrega, 1994) and Jordan Valley Water Conservation District\n(JVWCD) (Mohadjer and Rice, 2004). Under New York City's Toilet Rebate Program, at least 70% of\nthe toilets in apartment buildings were required to be replaced. About 50,000 apartment buildings had\ntheir toilets replaced under the program, and a \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 monitoring project by the\nDepartment of Environmental Protection in a sample of 39 retrofitted apartment buildings reported that\nwater consumption had declined, on average, about 37%. These particularly high levels of savings were\nprobably mainly due to the high levels of leakage prior to the retrofit (California Urban Water Use\nBulletin, 1994). In the JVWCD case the reduction in leakage resulting from toilet replacements\naccounted, on average, for 44% of the water savings. In the San Francisco study (Mayer et al, 2003) the\nremoval of leakage from the overall savings data showed that the actual impact of the retrofit of\nappliances was a demand reduction of 27.9 percent (39% including leakage reduction). Furthermore,\nduring the pre-program data collection period, it was found that only 10 houses (38 percent) in the San\nFrancisco study were responsible for more than 85 percent of the total household leakage.\n13\nResults from the Sydney Water Company Every Drop Counts (EDC) program which involved the\nlargest ever DSM study in Australia were recently reported by Turner et al (2004). For research\npurposes a large sample of over 24,000 randomly selected single residential household participants (out\nof a total participating population of 200,000) and an equal number of non participants (representing\nthe control group) were used for the analysis. Between July 2000 and July 2002 the control group\nincreased demand by 80 litres\/household\/day (l\/hh\/d) and participants increased demand by 22.7 l\/hh\/d.\nHence both the controls and participants increased demand in absolute terms, which the authors point\nout is likely to be associated with the fact that 2002 was a hot dry year compared to 1999. Participants\nhave ultimately reduced demand relative to the control group, and the \u2018relative savings\u2019 attributable to\nthe program so far are 57.3 l\/hh\/d indicating that the program has achieved savings of approximately\n8% of average household demand and 12% of estimated indoor demand.\nHowever, not all retro-fit programs result in savings and, as a number of experiences in the UK and\nUSA where ultra-low flush toilets (ULFT) were installed have shown, the type of technology used can\nhave a major impact on both the potential savings and customer receptivity (Mayer et al, 2003; UK\nEnvironment Agency, 1997). Offsetting behaviour, discussed in Section 3.1 of this paper, can also be a\nmajor factor in the success of campaigns involving water saving devices.\n2.2.2. Outdoor water use. As noted above, previous research has found that outdoor water use is more\nprice elastic than indoor water use (e.g. Foster and Beattie, 1979; Bruvold and Smith, 1988; UKWIR,\n1996; Renwick and Archibald, 1998) due to the more discretionary nature of the former. Irrigation is\nthe major component of outdoor water use and lawn reticulation systems can contribute a significant\nproportion of variance to external usage values (Chestnutt and Mcspadden, 1991; Renwick and\nArchibald, 1998). In a recent study, households with more sophisticated lawn reticulation systems were\nfound to have used more water externally than those with manually operated irrigation systems (Syme\net al, 2004). The researchers suggest that a reason for this may be a tendency to set timing devices for\nlonger periods or more frequently than other irrigation modes. This is supported by research in the\nUSA by Chesnutt and McSpadden (1991) who found that single family households in Los Angeles\nwith automatic sprinkler systems consumed on average 11.2 percent more than those households using\nmanually controlled sprinkler systems or watering by hand. This poses a significant challenge to the\n14\nstandard promotion of reducing water usage by installing automatic reticulation systems. Because the\nownership of automatic reticulation systems has increased rapidly over recent years, Syme et al (2004)\npoint out that it will be crucial for the water agencies to introduce educational programs to ensure that\nthe systems are used appropriately and that water efficiency outside the home is achieved.\n2.3. Educational tools\nEngaging the public on water conservation issues is important for the objectives of any DSM campaign\n(Bruvold and Smith, 1988; Lant, 1993; Howarth and Butler, 2004). The difficulty involved in\ndisaggregating the impact of consumer awareness campaigns from other DSM tools means that they are\noften reported as a combined saving with other measures. A number of programs however have\nreported disaggregated results which are shown in Table 3 below.\n[Insert Table 3 about here].\nPublic awareness campaigns (e.g. media broadcasts) are generally expected to reduce demand by 2-5 %\n(Baumann et al, 1998); (USEPA, 1998) and are usually a temporary measure (Wang et al, 1999). A\nstudy of an education campaign in southern Arizona for example showed that water use as a function of\npublicity about water problems had an average elasticity of -0.05 suggesting that a 10 percent increase\nin the amount of publicity about the need to conserve water would produce a 0.5% reduction in water\nuse. The researchers do not explain how this was measured but conclude that the publicity variable in\ntheir study showed \u2018no significant lagged effect, thus indicating that the effect of publicity exists only\nas long as publicity continues\u2019 (Billing and Day, 1989). Longer term awareness can be achieved\nthrough education and by encouraging participation with the local community, a good example being\nthe case of Zaragosa in Spain. The initial emphasis in the Zaragosa public education campaign was\nidentifying the suppliers of water efficient devices and bringing them in contact with the public and\nsecond, informing the wider public through exposition, school visits, and community presentations on\nthe merits and practicalities of water saving. After one year an evaluation was carried out showing a\n15\ndecrease in the city\u2019s annual water consumption of 5.6%. The program also recorded an increase in\nawareness among 28% of Zaragosa\u2019s population (UK Environment Agency, 1999)\nAdopting a different form of public education, the Artesian Water Company in New Castle County,\nDelaware (U.S.A) (Wang et al, 1999) used bill inserts and pamphlets as an information source among a\nsample group of the population. Demand reduction of 4.8% in the summer months was recorded\nbetween 1992 and 1997.\nResearch indicates that the impact of education campaigns may vary for regions with different xeric\nregimes. Using an American Water Works Association (AWWA) survey of 430 U.S. water utilities,\nNieswiadomy (1992) estimated the impacts of public education campaigns on water conservation for\nfour different regions in the United States \u2013 North Central, Northeast, South and West. His results\nshowed that public education programs which urge people to conserve water significantly reduce water\ndemand only in the western USA which is more prone to water scarcity. This finding is supported by\nother examples such as those provided by Renwick and Green (2000) who used a cross-sectional\nmonthly time series econometric model to study the effects of DSM tools including education in eight\nwater supply areas in the western USA. The study estimated that public information campaigns reduced\ndemand by an average of eight percent. In contrast, a study in Swindon in the UK by Thames Water\nand the Environment agency among 8000 residences found that a campaign involving direct mailing,\nnewspaper and radio advertisements, and posters had no impact on demand and only 5% of the\npopulation questioned indicated that they had noticed the campaign (Howarth and Butler, 2004).\n2.4. Operation and maintenance tools\nLosses due to leakage in water networks can account for a significant fraction of water demand. Losses\nfor water networks vary in different countries and in different regions in different countries. For\nexample research by the EEA (2003) has reported major losses of water due to leakage in Italy of 30\npercent and in Bulgaria of 50 percent. The potential for reducing water demand by reducing leakage is\ntherefore significant. In the UK, leakage reduction has led to a reduction in demand since 1997, when\nwater companies were given mandatory leakage targets based on their economic level of leakage (i.e.\n16\nthe cost of repair weighed against the cost of losses) and also offered free supply pipe leakage detection\nand repair service for their customers (Ofwat, 2000b). Data on the precise savings achieved are not\navailable, but since its peak in 1994-95, leakage among UK water companies has fallen by 31 percent\nfrom 228 litres\/property\/day to 174 litres\/property\/day (Ofwat, 2000b). The fact that reducing\ninfrastructure leakage can reduce overall demand so significantly means that it is often considered to be\nmore effective and therefore more important than other DSM tools.\nSaegrov et al (1999) have identified a need for greater international collaboration, particularly in\nEurope and North America relating to the exchange of current practices relating to static, dynamic and\noperating factors which can affect leakage. This is also relevant to the sharing and exchange of results\nand ideas about other DSM tools.\n2.5. Regulatory rules and legislation,\nComplementary legislation can be used both to encourage implementation of other DSM tools and to\nimpose restrictions on water consumption. Restrictions can be characterised on an increasing scale (i.e.\nvoluntary to mandatory measures). An example of how legislative tools can be combined with other\nDSM tools and implemented as a cascade of measures to address short-term water scarcity is presented\nbelow in Table 4 showing relevant cumulative savings as reported in the UK (UKWIR, 1998).\nIn both Australia (White, 2001) and the USA (USEPA, 1998) the introduction of plumbing codes\ncombined with a labelling approach for water efficient goods has been introduced with results\nindicating overall savings for the water utility of 5-10 percent over a 10 year period. In Goleta,\nCalifornia, a mandatory allocation policy was introduced where households were charged based on\nhistorical water use with significant marginal price penalties for households exceeding their allotment;\nthis approach reduced the average household consumption by 28.2 percent (Renwick and Archibald,\n1998). Renwick and Archibald also found that the allocation policy reduced demand more among low\ndensity respondents with larger landscaped areas (57 l\/hh\/d) than high density respondents (27 l\/hh\/d)\nwith smaller amounts of landscaping. Restrictions applied to certain water uses, such as washing down\npavements or driveways, car-washing, and banning landscape irrigation during peak evapo-\n17\ntranspiration hours has also been shown to reduced consumption, by 29 percent in California (Renwick\nand Archibald, 1998) and 25-35% in Greece (Kanakoudis, 2002).\n[Insert Table 4 about here].\n3. Identified influences on the effectiveness of residential DSM tools\nIn the previous section the reported savings of different types of DSM tools in different regions have\nbeen discussed. In the following section we give examples of how the conditions of implementation\n(e.g. environmental and demographic factors) can influence the effectiveness of different DSM tools.\nResearch shows that indoor household water consumption is dependent upon a number of factors, the\nmost important of which are household occupancy (Mitchell, 2001; Turner et al, 2004), household\nincome (Jones and Morris, 1984; Moncur, 1987), and the type of water intensive household appliance\ninstalled (Mayer et al, 2004a; Decook et al, 1988). Outdoor water use is affected by climate or the\nevapo-transpiration rate (Maddaus, 2001; California Urban Water Use Bulletin, 1994), plot size or\npopulation density (Renwick and Archibald, 1998; Maddaus et al, 1996) irrigation method (Syme et al,\n2004; Renwick and Archibald, 1998) and also local cultural norms (Maddaus et al, 1996). Collection of\ndisaggregated data regarding these factors is a high priority when specifying and targeting DSM tools\nfor a specific region because it will affect the water saving potential, and therefore the relative returns,\nfrom implementation.\nThere is a high variation in per capita demand between different countries around the world, in\ndifferent cities within different countries, and in different neighbourhoods in different cities, and this in\nturn affects the potential for different DSM tools to reduce consumption. For example in the EDC\ncampaign in Sydney, Australia, analysis of the savings of participants in different Local Government\nAreas (LGA) shows that participants in 22 out of 40 LGAs achieved significantly higher relative\nsavings when compared to their controls (Turner et al, 2004). The range of savings for LGA\u2019s varied\nfrom the highest (183.5 l\/hh\/d) in the Lane Cove area, to the lowest (41.1 l\/hh\/d) in the Sutherland area.\n18\nThis indicates that the targeting of some LGAs could be more beneficial to provide high relative\nsavings than others.\nThe relative savings accruing to three income groups were also analysed by Turner et al (2004). The\nresults of their analysis indicated that it would be beneficial to seek higher uptake amongst low-income\ngroups who have high average relative savings of 69.9 l\/hh\/d. Targeting of low income groups would\nnot only provide high relative savings, thus increasing the overall level of savings of the program, but\nalso lead to added social benefits for low income households in the community. Furthermore, of over\n200,000 participants 38% were exempt from paying for the retrofit due to proof of low income status\nwhereas the Australian Bureau of Statistics states that only 22% of households in the Sydney came\nfrom this low-income group (Turner et al, 2004) indicating a relatively higher uptake of DSM tools\namong low-income households. An explanation for this might be that low income householders have\nhigher indoor water demand than other groups due to higher occupancy, so installing water saving\ndevices free-of charge would be more advantageous.\nUrbanisation can be a major cause of unsustainable water consumption due to the impact on population\nsize. As well as increasing total domestic demand, an additional difficulty that water planners face due\nto in-migration is that newcomers may bring attitudes and behaviours more suitable to less arid areas\nand will initially be less aware of water conservation issues (Trumbo and O\u2019Keefe, 2005).\nResearch into how social perceptions of water conservation measures might affect the implementation\nof DSM is reported on in the following section discussing offsetting behaviour.\n3.1 Offsetting behaviour. In 1975, Peltzman\u2019s work on automobile safety regulation raised the spectre\nof offsetting behaviour decreasing policy effectiveness \u2013 and perhaps even leading to perverse\noutcomes \u2013 when people consume more of a good than they usually would (Peltzman, 1975). There is\nalso evidence of offsetting behavioural responses to water conservation policies (Geller et al, 1983;\nCampbell et al, 2004). Geller et al (1983) found evidence of offsetting behaviour in their experiment\ninvolving educational, behavioural, and engineering strategies for inducing residential water\nconservation (and all combinations of the three in their 2 x 2 x 2 design). Their findings strongly\n19\nsuggest that people engage in offsetting behaviour when they know devices are causing conservation.\nFor example, if people know that their showerhead is low-flow, they may feel free to take longer\nshowers.\nFurthermore, a study of the trade-offs between prices, people, devices, and rules, in Phoenix Arizona of\n19,000 households over six years (Campbell et al, 2004) found empirical evidence that offsetting\nbehaviour is dependent on the mode of water saving device implementation. Summarising the study,\nCampbell et al (2004) make a number of observations that we consider to be central to the aims of this\nreview.\nThe city officials tried to legislate for the use of water-saving devices, to randomly give people water-\nsaving devices, to invite people to pick up water-saving devices, and had individual people work with\nindividual households to install water-saving devices. These different settings helped illuminate the\nconditions under which offsetting behaviour appears and what can be done to ameliorate it. One\nindication was that ignorance prevents offsetting behaviour (Geller et al, 1983), though this has grave\nimplications for citizenship and governance. Whether people picked water saving devices up or were\ngiven them randomly, it was obvious that people knew that the fixtures were water-saving, and this\ntactic at best had little effect, at worst induced water consumption. Taking the results for devices alone,\nthe results for these programs suggest that personalized communication can enhance the water saving\npotential of implementation and decrease the effect of offsetting behaviour. They also infer that\ncommunication is even more important than self-selection. The possibility of offsetting behaviour\nshould be kept firmly in the mind of the policy analyst and public administrator.\nThe cooperation literature (Ostrom, et al, 1993). tends to support the importance of repeated\ncommunication\u2014a brochure is a one-shot communication; billboards and radio messages may be heard\nmany times. Depending on how the program is designed, education to children may combine personal\ncommunication with multiple messages (Campbell et al, 2004).\nThe durability of effects of conservation programs may decline over time. However, this is true of all\npolicy interventions. Hardware devices themselves wear out over time. Price increases are overtaken by\n20\ninflation. Engineering-focused regulations, such as those used here, become obsolete as technology\nimproves, and so on. Thus, all of these concerns just remind us that policies cannot be static\u2014we\ncannot expect to find the best one and then move on; we must revisit even policies that have been\neffective (Campbell et al, 2004). This supports the need for the setting up of an organisation\nspecifically to design, implement, and continuously monitor DSM programs, a suggestion that is\nwidely supported by other DSM commentators (e.g. Gumbo 2004; Turner et al, 2004; Read, 2005,\nWhite, 2001).\nCampbell et al (2004) also make an important point regarding \u2018coercive types of regulation\u2019 which is\nmentioned here because of its relevance to the overall conclusions in her study. The most coercive\ntypes of regulation\u2014command and control rules\u2014have been much criticized in recent years because\nthey are not market-like and therefore, at least in principle, are less efficient. In addition, there is some\nevidence that people in particular do not support them for water conservation (Avalos & De Young,\n1995). However, Weimer & Vining (1999) state, \u201cWhile it is fashionable to focus on the disadvantages\nof rules . . . , rules may provide the most efficient method for dealing with market failures in some\ncontexts.\u201d They further point out that such regulation can provide higher certainty of outcomes.\nIn sum, Campbell et al (2004) conclude that in the trade-offs between prices, people, devices, and rules,\nprices and rules are the most certain and, because they can be applied generally to all households, their\ncumulative effects can be great. Simply giving households engineered devices is not effective.\nOffsetting behaviour may be so strong that effectiveness is swamped; here, non-market provision by\ngovernment is a poor choice, unless mediated by direct communication. However, programs that must\nbe administered one-on-one to individual households will tend to have a smaller impact overall, even if\nthey have a greater impact per affected household\u2014 but these techniques do have the advantage of\ninducing cooperation, which is in keeping with participatory democracy. Prices and rules are\nadministratively more inexpensive with high effectiveness; cooperative programs educate citizens but\nrequire more resources and are less effective overall.\nWe observe that offsetting behaviour is linked to awareness of the installation of water saving devices,\nas well as the high certainty regarding rules is a strong argument for introducing water efficiency rating\n21\nschemes along the \u2018white goods\u2019 supply chain, to include, for example, manufacturers and wholesalers\nof white goods, plumbers, and building contractors.\n4. Identified influences on the adoption of residential DSM tools\nAchieving coverage of DSM tools depends on a number of factors. These include financial factors such\nas the cost of installing vs. the potential savings, willingness to make lifestyle changes, access to\nsuitable technology etc. In order for DSM tools to reach the target population it may be necessary to\nintroduce specially designed policies to encourage uptake. A number of instances where\nimplementation policies have been relatively successful are given below.\nIn a 1991 customer survey, the City of Los Angeles learned that poor customers were receptive to\nconservation programs but less likely to participate than wealthier customers (Pollyea, 1993) probably\nbecause of the initial investment required. Research in Sydney, Australia (Turner et al, 2004) and\nAustin, USA (Poch, 1995) has shown that the indoor water saving potential of DSM in low income\nresidencies is 18% and 34% greater respectively than in other socioeconomic groups as shown below in\nFigure 2. The results of the two studies also show that if DSM strategies are offered free-of-charge for\nlow income households, the potential uptake can increase significantly (i.e. 100% in Austin Texas and\n16% higher than other socioeconomic groups in Sydney). The Austin Ultra Low-Flow Toilet Outreach\nProgram provided free toilets, showers and leakage repair to residents in traditionally low- income zip-\ncodes. Program eligibility took into account family size and income with different thresholds for\nresidents under and over 60.\n[Insert Figure 2. about here].\nThe majority of program participants had incomes less than US$25,000. The program objective was to\nencourage uptake in low-income households because low-income households had not participated in\nthe previous toilet rebate program because of the initial investment required.\n22\nAlthough uptake figures were not available the program anticipated replacing 15,000 toilets, with a\nsaving of 2.2 M\/litres per day, and 100 percent coverage (AWWArf, 2001). Water municipalities in\nboth Australia and USA have used computer mapping software to identify postcodes or regions which\nare suitable for a certain type of DSM strategy (e.g. low income, low density, high evapo-transpiration\nrate). A mapping approach can be useful to target identified social groups with relevant policy tools,\nthereby utilising identified influences on adoption.\n4.1 Synergistic relationships between price and non-price mechanisms\nA number of authors have suggested that pricing and metering might raise citizen\u2019s awareness of the\nneed for water conservation (Bruvold and Smith, 1988; Van Vugt, 2001; Campbell et al, 2004). Pricing\ncan be regulatory if prices are intentionally set in a regulatory process to achieve policy goals, but\npricing still allows an element of voluntary behaviour as it allows people to make their own decisions\nfaced with the administered price; as such pricing induces rather than requires change.\nIn preparing this review no studies were found that specifically focus on the link between pricing-\nmetering and the uptake of specific non-price mechanisms. This is indicative of the difficulty in\ndistinguishing between people\u2019s different motivations for displaying conservation behaviour. One\nstudy in the USA (Hamilton, 1983) developed a causal model of water conservation behaviour, and\nresults indicated that \u2018economic motives seemed to be common among poorer, less well educated\nhouseholds, with more children and high baseline use levels\u2019. This repeats the findings among low-\nincome households in the USA by Renwick and Green (2000). Hamilton (1983) continues that\n\u2018concerns with the economic aspects of water consumption are obviously quite realistic for such\nhouseholds, though the concern did not translate into substantial savings\u2019. This low level of\nresponsiveness among low-income households to pricing and metering would indicate that synergistic\nrelationships between price and non-price mechanisms are limited to non-price mechanisms and those\nthat citizens can implement free-of-change (e.g. behavioural changes or freely available water saving\ntechnology).\n23\nMetering has the advantage of improving customer\u2019s knowledge about their consumption, particularly\nwhen combined with specific tariff structures. Previous research (Bruvold and Smith, 1988; Trumbo\nand O\u2019Keefe, 2005) has shown that customer knowledge about consumption is significantly related to\nlower demand and is more important than their beliefs about water conservation in reducing water\nconsumption. Furthermore, a number of researchers, (e.g. Bruvold and Smith, 1988; Van Vugt, 2001)\nconclude that the use of an increasing block structure coupled with an information campaign designed\nto inform customers of their consumption under each block will have a synergistic effects in improving\ncustomer knowledge about water consumption, and awareness of the need for reduction.\nThe relationship between price elasticity and willingness to participate in non-price DSM programs\nraises an important point relating to the observation made in the previous section regarding the\ndifference between price elasticity among low-income households in the UK and USA (i.e. price\nelasticity is higher among low-income households in the USA due to higher outdoor water use which\ncan be reduced through voluntary behavioural adaptations prompted by price). Because it is relatively\nmore expensive for a low-income family to change its appliances than for a high-income one, if\ntechnological DSM tools were offered free of charge to low-income households (as they were in the\nexamples in the Sydney Water Company EDC and Austin ULFT outreach campaigns discussed\npreviously) then we might expect low income families to be better able to reduce their indoor\nconsumption. This relationship is particularly relevant in the design of DSM campaigns in sections of\nthe community characterised by low-income households.\n4.2. Mediating processes and DSM implementation\nIn regions with a high proportion of domestic use DSM can play a major role in addressing water\nstress. In an earlier paper Bruvold (1988) identified three mediating cognitive processes and one\nmediating structural processes that affect water conservation behaviour which have been referred to\neither singly or collectively by subsequent researchers (e.g. Syme et al, 1999). Due to the wide-range\nand different scale of influences on DSM, the link between wider socio-economic and environmental\ninfluences and these mediating processes are often difficult to discern.\n24\nIn the earlier sections of this paper drivers of increasing per capita consumption and associated water\nstress were identified and these, along with the connected mediating processes suggested by Bruvold\n(1988) are presented in a conceptual model in Figure 3 (below).\n[Insert Figure 3. about here].\n5. Discussion\nThe following section explores a number of challenges relating to prior and post evaluation of DSM\nand its role in the DSM implementation decision process.\n5.1 The role of evaluation in DSM implementation\nBecause the decision to implement DSM has wide-ranging social impacts, and also inevitably requires\nfinancial intervention from the water sector or local government, the case for DSM needs to be\nrigorously tested and proven. It requires evaluation of social, economic, and environmental impacts\nand, where possible, should to be supported by historical evidence.\nOne of the problems faced in using data collected from previous studies to make prior-evaluations of\nthe potential impacts of DSM is (lack of) transferability of trends between regions. For example, the\nsuccess of a DSM program in one region may not be reflected in another region due to the situation\nspecific socio-demographic \/ socio-economic water demand trends. In another region, the impact of\nother factors, e.g. climate, will come to bear on water availability and demand trends. Climate also\ninevitably affects the water culture of local citizens, complicating further the interface between society\nand agencies responsible for water governance. This last point in particular means that policy\nmechanisms need to be carefully crafted to handle cultural sensitivities on a regional basis.\nFurthermore, \u2018region\u2019 can, in some instances, be replaced by \u2018neighbourhood\u2019, if there is low resolution\nof socio-demographic and socio-economic variation.\nTo understand the relevance of the lack of transferability of DSM program performance data on policy-\nmaking it may be helpful to distinguish between using \u2018theoretical\u2019 and \u2018actual\u2019 DSM program\nperformance data. Theoretical evaluation based on \u2018expert\u2019 forecasts is often the only accessible\n25\ninformation that policy makers have, in the first instance, on which to base their decisions. However,\nthe lack of transferability of trends, even at the household scale, means that in the first instance\nuncertainty is usually high in DSM forecasting, and this is a possible barrier to commitment by relevant\ninstitutions. A prior evaluation only becomes credible as actual (empirical) evidence is gathered (e.g.\nthrough pilot-scale DSM projects). For this reason the lack of transferability of trends is problematic\nbecause, given the lack of credible proof, even pilot-scale studies will still require the existence of\n\u2018champions\u2019 of DSM. This point is relevant to the discussion in Section 5.2 (below).\nPrior evaluation of DSM inevitably involves economic appraisal and there has been much debate about\nthe economic method used. An early study in the USA (Hirshliefer et al, 1960) criticised the then\nprevalent practice of comparing water projects by measuring the ratio of the present worth (PW) of\nbenefits (PWB) to the PW of costs (PWC). The authors demonstrated that it was in fact the NPV (net\npresent value), the absolute difference between the two (i.e. cost-benefit analysis \u2013 CBA), that should\n(i) determine whether a given one-off water scheme should go ahead or not and (ii) form the basis of\nscheme ranking.\nThe authors put their ideas to work in the context of New York\u2019s then \u2018water crises. They compared\nvarious suggested options for the \u201cimprovement of existing supplies\u201d (leakage reduction, domestic\nmetering extension, and price increase for metered consumers) with the new (Cannonsville) dam\nsupply project which had already begun. This led the authors to a comparison, based on present worth\ncalculation, of the costs of the three demand-management options (respectively $1, $148, and $267 per\nmillion US gallons saved, using an annual discount rate of 6%) with the estimated Cannonsville cost of\n$459 per million US gallons supplied. The case for DSM options were concluded to be, respectively,\n\u201coverwhelming\u201d, \u201cimpressive\u201d, and \u201carguable\u201d.\nHowever despite the apparent advantages afforded to DSM indicated in the above studies, nearly ten\nyears later Steve Hanke (1981) spent a hectic decade publicising the application of CBA (via NPV) to\nimprove decision-taking in the US water industry, covering both the formulation of marginal cost based\npricing techniques and the assessment of a wide range of demand-management measures (Herrington,\n2006).\n26\nIn the UK increasing interest in these matters found practical expression in a contract let out by UK\nWater Industry Research and the Environment Agency (UKWIR & EA) to NERA (London) in 1995\n(Herrington, 2006). The framework developed (Economics of Demand Management \u2013 EDM) had to be\nacceptable to the economic and environmental regulators \u2013 the Office of Water Services, and the\nEnvironment Agency, respectively. The \u2018Practical Guidelines\u2019 report put into practice least-cost\nplanning, the agreed formal planning objective being to minimise the net social cost of balancing the\nsupply and demand for water into the future. This could be achieved by calculating the average\nincremental social cost (AISC) for each of the supply and demand options, which then need to be\n\u201cselected and timed in increasing order of AISC to form an initial solution: a programme of options\nwhich balances supply and demand over the horizon (Baker et al, 1996).\nWithin four years it was claimed in a second NERA report commissioned by UKWIR\/EA that there\nwas (i) significant variability in the use made of the 1996 report and Guidelines, (ii) some\nmisinterpretations of the suggested approaches and (iii) key outstanding methodological issues\n(Atkinson & Jones, 2001).\nThe New York example is one of many reporting the economic efficiency of demand-side management\n(e.g. see for the USA - Maddaus, 1996; 1999, and for Australia \u2013 Burn et al, 2002). A more recent\nstudy in Australia, comparing the economics of demand vs. supply-side options (Fane et al, 2002),\nreports the importance of the methods used to make economic evaluation. Fane et al (2002) conclude\nthat the use of annualised unit cost for large scale supply schemes is inherently misleading. The unit\ncost calculated by this method does not represent the true cost of supply. Excluded are periods when\ndemand can be expected to be significantly less than safe yield. The result is a systematic under\nrepresentation of the cost of supply from large scale supply projects such as new dams (Fane et al,\n2002). Using Levelised cost significantly altered the ranking of the options, in particular, decreasing\nthe cost effectiveness of building new dams because \u201cannualised cost does not reflect the fact that with\nprojected rate of demand increase, it would be nearly 70 years before the safe yield from this project\nwas fully utilised\u201d.\n27\nResidential water savings can lead to a number of quantifiable benefits for water utilities which are\noverlooked in some economic evaluation methods. Advantages include: reduction in operation and\nmaintenance costs, deferral or downsizing of capital facilities, and reduced water purchases from\nwholesale providers (Maddaus, 1999). Least cost planning has emerged as the way forward for water\nutilities in regions where water conservation has become an objective or where ongoing supply\nexpansion is constrained (Fane et al, 2004). Least cost planning originated in the energy sector in the\nUnited States during the 1980\u2019s for comparing energy conservation programs with increased generation\nfrom sources of supply (Beecher, 1996). In the Australian water sector water conservation is based on\nthe key ideas that: demand is for the services water provides rather than the actual volume supplied;\nand that a drop of water saved is equal to a drop supplied (Fane et al, 2004).\nThe above discussion about economic evaluation highlights the importance of the methods used, as\nwell as the unfortunate scope for ambiguity, particularly with regard to deciding which externalities to\ninclude in economic evaluations.\nIn this section we have described two major factors (non-transferability of trends & legitimacy of\neconomic appraisal methods) which potentially undermine both the validity and legitimacy of projects\naimed at evaluating the potential impact and efficiency of demand-side measures in managing water\nscarcity. Because evaluation is used by policy-makers to design suitable regulatory instruments, and\nregulatory instruments inevitably determine the timing of implementation of DSM to ameliorate water\nscarcity, we recognise these two factors as being a priority for future research in the scientific\ncommunity.\nThe following section discusses different institutional setting that require different types of regulatory\ninstruments to probe water utilities to engage in DSM. We discuss the timing of implementation of\nDSM and cite examples of how regulatory instruments can on the one hand help avoid, but on the other\nmay induce an anachronistic tendency in responses to water scarcity.\n5.2 Engaging governments and water utilities in DSM\n28\nThe level of engagement (or non-engagement) by governments and water utilities in DSM planning is\nprobably the most important factor in determining whether DSM is used as a reactive response or as a\nlong-term pro-active measure. In the case of the USA, the debate regarding the timing of responses to\nwater scarcity is best summed up by Elisabeth Graffy (2006) in her recent article \u2018Expert Forecasts and\nthe Emergence of Water Scarcity on Public Agendas\u2019 who comments that:\n\u201cthe institutional fragmentation of water expertise and prevailing patterns of communication about\nwater scarcity militate against the formulation of a common public definition of the problem and\nencourage reliance on crises to stimulate social and policy agenda setting. Expert forecasts of\nworldwide water scarcity suggest the need for preventive, coordinated, and comprehensive public\nagendas, but existing approaches remain crisis driven and ad hoc\u201d.\nWith regard to recent policy changes in the USA she comments that:\n\u201cLocal and national agenda setting since 2002 provides fresh opportunities for expert networks to\nbecome engaged. In the absence of such efforts, further agenda setting is likely to rely on\ncatastrophic events, rendering the preventive function of expert forecasts largely moot\u201d.\nThe commitment and advances in DSM in Australia, reported earlier in this paper, are reflected in the\n2004 national drought policy which has already started to adopt a risk management, as opposed to\ncrisis management, approach to ameliorating water scarcity in the domestic sector (Wilhite, 2005).\nIn Europe, Article 14 of the Water Framework Directive promotes the \u201cactive involvement of all\ninterested parties\u201d which is important in the context of demand management because water\nconservation\/efficiency programmes are unlikely to succeed in the absence of public involvement and\nsupport (Howarth, 2006).\nIn the UK the Water Act received Royal Assent in 2003, and water conservation is addressed in\nspecific sections addressing \u2018efficient use of water resources\u2019 (Section 81), \u2018requirements on relevant\nundertakers\u2019 (Section 82) and \u2018water conservation by public authorities\u2019 (Section 83). As Howarth\n29\n(2006) points out, in the UK, \u2018sticks\u2019 have played a greater role than \u2018carrots\u2019 in introducing water\nefficiency, and we may hypothesis that this is partly a result of comprehensive privatisation and\nsubsequent heavy regulation in the UK water sector.\n6. Conclusions\nEvidence indicates water price elasticity for indoor use is relatively low meaning that large increases in\nprice are required to significantly reduce indoor water consumption, which could be economically\ncounterproductive for low-income groups. On the other hand, outdoor consumption is more responsive\nto changes in price and mandatory restrictions. Accordingly, if used, we suggest that pricing structures\nshould be accompanied by a number of complimentary DSM policies including\n\uf0a7 a \u2018lifeline\u2019 rate to accommodate low-income groups.\n\uf0a7 sufficient opportunities for water consumers to reduce their indoor water consumption without\nexcessive costs, and\n\uf0a7 seasonal rates to reflect variations in seasonal demand.\nWe have reported research showing that offsetting behaviour is linked to water consumer\u2019s awareness\nof the installation of water saving devices. We suggest that this observation, and the high certainty of\nwater savings achieved by policy \u2018rules\u2019, suggests that there is a strong argument for introducing water\nefficiency rating schemes along the \u2018white goods\u2019 supply chain, to include, for example, manufacturers\nand wholesalers of white goods, plumbers, and building contractors.\nFrom this review it can be concluded that indoor consumption in existing housing can be reduced by 35\n- 50% if water intensive appliances are comprehensively replaced. An important caveat to this\nconclusion is that potential water savings might be significantly less in regions where domestic water\nconsumption is already relatively low (e.g. if water intensive appliances are not widely used).\nReplacement of old toilets offers the greatest water saving potential and this is, in part, due to the\nincidental repair of leaking toilet valves. Substantial indoor savings are possible amongst low income\nhouseholds but water efficient appliances need to be offered and installed free of charge to achieve\nsignificant coverage. Regulatory measures such as upgrading of water efficient technology when a\n30\nchange of household occupancy occurs has been shown to be a successful method of achieving uptake\nof water meters. This approach might be transferable to improve coverage of technological DSM tools\nand requires further investigation.\nOverall, DSM programs can be expected to reduce water consumption by 10 to 20 percent over a 10 to\n20 year period depending on type of approach used, and, as already mentioned, the level of residential\nper capita consumption before implementation of DSM measures. From the reported findings it can be\nconcluded that in general, relatively moderate (5-15%) reductions in aggregate demand can be achieved\nthrough modest price increases and voluntary alternative DSM policy instruments, but to achieve larger\nreductions in demand (greater than 15%), policymakers will likely need to consider either relatively\nlarge price increases, or more stringent mandatory policy instruments (Renwick and Green, 2000;\nMaddaus, 1999).\n6.1 Recommendations for future research\n6.1.1 Metering and consumer engagement in water conservation. Research shows that consumer\nknowledge about water consumption is the most important cognitive process in driving consumer\ninterest in reducing water demand (Lant, 1993), but such knowledge is currently lacking. Metering has\nthe potential to engage consumers in DSM programs by improving their knowledge about personal\nwater consumption. It is concluded that metering is currently under-utilised in this respect and future\nresearch could explore innovative methods to allow consumer\u2019s to access their water consumption on a\ndaily basis (e.g. via the internet, special purpose LCD)\n6.1.2 Pricing mechanisms. Innovative pricing mechanisms (e.g. increasing block price based on per\ncapita consumption (Liu et al, 2003) which achieve both efficiency and affordability require further\nresearch in the form of large scale pilot studies.\n6.1.3 DSM policies to compliment the use of conservation pricing. As already mentioned, if pricing\nmechanisms are to be used as part of a DSM strategy they should be accompanied by a number of other\nDSM policies. Combinations of pricing and complimentary policies that achieve the goals of\nefficiency, equity, and sustainability require further research.\n31\n6.1.4 Raising awareness of water scarcity on public agendas. DSM can lead to a number of\nquantifiable benefits for water utilities including reduced operation and maintenance costs, deferral or\ndownsizing of capital facilities, and reduced water purchases from wholesale providers. However,\nimplementation of DSM tools (e.g. in all new developments) requires participation by relevant\nstakeholders, most importantly from local and national government. There is scope for future research\ninto participatory methods of evaluation that engage all stakeholders in DSM.\n6.1.5 Investigation of the use of \u2018stick\u2019s (regulation) and \u2018carrots\u2019 (incentives). It is possible to\nobserve an interesting, if somewhat abstract, connection between the predominant role of \u2018sticks\u2019 as\nregulatory instruments in the UK (Howarth, 2006), Elisabeth Graffy\u2019s observation that \u201cfurther agenda\nsetting is likely to rely on catastrophic events\u201d, and the phenomenon of offsetting behaviour. This\nconnection is a tension between lack of willingness to engage, possibly due to the potential socio-\npsychological, as well as political risks of using \u2018command and control\u2019 rules, and the potential risks of\nnot acting at all to forecasts of water scarcity. There is certainly scope to explore the different coping\nmechanisms in different cultural and institutional settings in future cross-country, comparative\nresearch.\n6.1.6 Analysis of the DSM implementation decision-processes and methods to manage\nuncertainty. We recommend that more carefully designed and monitored pilot-scale studies are\nrequired during evaluation\nThe decision process involved in DSM implementation inevitably begins with a feasibility study to\ninvestigate the potential impact of the specific measure (s), against forecasts of water scarcity. The\ncombination of the forecasts of demand and availability, particularly using long-term projections is\ncharacterised by high uncertainty, and one might therefore wonder how the much needed commitment\nto DSM, necessary to achieve comprehensive implementation, can ever be attained. We hope that this\nreview has begun to address this issue by presenting data showing the real (as opposed to potential)\nimpact of DSM in a western, developed-world context. However, we observe that further work is\n32\nneeded in developing decision support tools that manage uncertainty both of water availability and\ndemands, to address the non-transferability of trends & legitimacy of economic appraisal methods.\n33\nAcknowledgements\nThe work on which this paper is based was supported by the European Commission 6th Framework\nProject \u2013 Aquastress, Contract No. 511231-2.
