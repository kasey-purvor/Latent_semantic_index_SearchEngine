London: Longman, 1999. Hard-\nback \u00a369. Pp. xii + 1,204. ISBN 0 582 23725 4.\nReviewed by Manfred Krug, University of Freiburg\nThe Longman grammar of spoken and written English (LGSWE) is the result of a\nsix-year transatlantic collaboration of \u00aeve distinguished corpus linguists. The bulk\nof the book was written by two contributors: Douglas Biber wrote half of the\nfourteen chapters, Stig Johansson another four; the remaining three co-authors\ncontributed roughly equal parts. Relatively close consistency and compatibility as\nregards terminology with its predecessor as major English grammar, Quirk et al.'s\n(1985) Comprehensive grammar of the English language (CGEL, published by the\nsame house), was ensured by the fact that Geoffrey Leech, one of the writers of the\n1985 reference grammar, took on the role of joint lead editor (with Douglas Biber)\nof this new book.1\nThe adoption of a similar framework in the two grammars is bene\u00aecial for several\nreasons. For one thing, the new grammar complements rather than replaces its\npredecessor, so that advanced students and scholars alike will need to consult both\nworks at the same time. The main difference between the two is that while Quirk et\nal. (1985) provide a comprehensive descriptive (and sometimes mildly prescriptive)\ncoverage of English grammar, Biber et al.'s rigorously descriptive work has its main\nfocus on frequency information. Put antithetically: Quirk et al. discuss what may\nand may not occur, and often provide constructed examples; Biber et al. discuss\nwhat actually does occur, and how often in a certain register, using authentic data\nfor illustration throughout. One consequence of this approach is that asterisks and\nquotation marks before examples enjoy markedly low frequencies, considering the\nfact that the work under review here is a grammar. It is slightly confusing, however,\nthat \u00b1 apart from indicating grammaticality judgments \u00b1 asterisks sometimes also\nindicate frequency thresholds (e.g. pp. 1031f.).\nGiven Biber's (1988; 1995) seminal work on register differentiation, it is not\nsurprising that quantitative detail is not given in a naive way for some idealized\nmonolithic language or `standard English'. On the contrary, the focus on varietal\ndifferences is perhaps the most important innovation of the LGSWE. Four `core\nregisters' are identi\u00aeed (pp. 24f.): conversation, \u00aection, newspaper language, and\nacademic prose. In other words, there exists no simplistic binary distinction between\n1 There are some exceptions to this general rule, most notably perhaps the (re-)introduction of the more\ntraditional term predicative in the description of syntactic functions instead of Quirk et al.'s term\ncomplement.\nEnglish Language and Linguistics 6.2: 379\u00b1416. # Cambridge University Press 2002\nDOI: 10.1017\/S136067430200028X Printed in the United Kingdom\na `spoken' and a `written' mode but a tripartite differentiation of the latter. Post-hoc\nthis strategy is also proven to be plausible since the distinctions between the registers\nselected manifest themselves in enormous (and sometimes counter-intuitive) statis-\ntical differences for many if not most features and, even more important, these\ndifferences allow for qualitative register-speci\u00aec generalizations. In fact, then, the\nLGSWE is not one grammar but contains four grammars. In addition, separate\n\u00aegures for conversational and non-conversational speech are occasionally given,\nthus adding a formality dimension within the description of spoken English. On the\nregional side, despite the scope of this grammar, it is only differences between\nBritish and American English that \u00aegure prominently (though perhaps not as\nprominently as some readers might have expected), thus leaving a great deal of\npotentially fruitful research to dialect grammarians.\nOverall the 40-million-word corpus used for the grammar is balanced between the\nabove-mentioned registers of conversation, \u00aection, newspaper language, and aca-\ndemic prose, with each subcorpus containing between about four and \u00aeve and a half\nmillion words. Fiction and academic writing are not as systematically subjected to\ndialectal comparisons as conversation and news, on the grounds that the former two\nregisters were found regionally to diverge much less than the latter two. Thus the\n5-million-word \u00aectional and academic subcorpora contain both British and Amer-\nican material, while the conversation and news components are British only. The\nsizes of the parallel American components are no less impressive: 4 million words of\nBritish conversation compare with 2.5 million words of American conversation; and\nthe American news component with its 5.2 million words matches its British\ncounterpart almost exactly in size. At 5.7 million words, \u00aenally, the supplementary\ncorpus of formal British speech is even larger than the conversational component of\neither variety.\nAs the more detailed breakdown of the corpus (pp. 29\u00b135) makes transparent,\neach individual subcorpus spreads fairly evenly across important parameters, such\nas age or sex of speakers (there are almost 500 speakers each in the British and\nAmerican conversational components); and the written subcorpora include a large\nvariety of topics, academic disciplines and newspaper sections as well. Given its\nenormous size and broad coverage, therefore, this corpus represents as close an\napproximation to a representative corpus of contemporary British and American\nEnglish as a linguist can currently hope for.2\nQuirk et al. (1985) too was a corpus-related project and functional in outlook.\nHowever, largely thanks to the work and inspiration of its contributors, corpora\n2 For comparison, the currently largest publicly available corpus, the British National Corpus, contains\n100 million words. It could not serve as a basis for the present grammar since it is, as its very name\nindicates, British English only, and not yet amenable to comparable register studies and, regrettably, the\nrepresentativeness (cl)aims were continuously watered down during that project. There are, however,\nsome unexpected texts in the corpus used for the LGSWE too, such as a considerable proportion of\n\u00aectional texts from the \u00aerst half of the twentieth century, as well as a few texts from Australia, the\nCaribbean, and West Africa.\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS380\nhave grown considerably since the 1980s, when two corpora of 1 million written\nwords and one spoken corpus of half a million words constituted the standard. And\njust as computational facilities have been improved greatly, so statistical procedures\nhave become more mainstream and more sophisticated since then. Indeed, corpus\nlinguistics became a more self-assertive linguistic branch (discipline or method, the\ndebate still being open) during the 1990s, which saw the rise of corpus methods in\nmany in\u00afuential journals, the establishment of the International Journal of Corpus\nLinguistics and the publication of no fewer than four textbooks between 1996 and\n1998 alone. (One of these, Biber et al. 1998, was incidentally co-written by two of the\npresent authors.) Thus, with its heavy focus on frequency information, the LGSWE\nis on the one hand avantgardist and setting the trend in corpus linguistics, but on the\nother hand it is itself part of a more general trend in linguistics at the turn of the\nmillennium.\nThe book's fourteen chapters fall into \u00aeve sections. An Introduction (pp. 1\u00b146)\nsetting out the corpus-based approach is followed by a section on word, phrase, and\nclause grammar (pp. 47\u00b1226). The next section (pp. 227\u00b1570) contains the expected\nchapters on the major word classes: nouns and pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and\nadverbs. Then follows a section that is devoted to more complex structures\n(pp. 571\u00b1892): noun phrases, complement clauses, and adverbials.\nThe last section on `grammar in a wider perspective' (pp. 893\u00b11127) contains the\nmost innovative chapters as far as subject-matter is concerned. It begins with a\nrelatively conventional discussion of word order, passive, and clefting from a\nfunctional perspective. Chapter 12 offers a fresh approach to current issues\nconnected with modality. While recent theoretical work has emphasized the inter-\ndependence of different markers of modality, this insight has not yet found its\nre\u00afection in existing grammar books. In the LGSWE the functional approach is\ntaken seriously: embracing an onomasiological approach to the grammatical\nmarking of stance (that is, identifying a given semantic or discourse function in\norder to then look at how this function is expressed through different linguistic\nforms) enables the authors to compare such formally diverse but functionally similar\nstructures as adverbials (e.g. surprisingly) and adjectives taking complement clauses\n(e.g. It's amazing that). Similarly, for expressing epistemic stance, modals (e.g.\nmight) are compared with stance nouns followed by prepositional phrases (e.g. the\npossibility of ) or intensi\u00aeers (e.g. really). The next chapter presents a radically\nempirical look at word combinations that sheds new light on phrasal and preposi-\ntional verbs, idiomatic expressions, discourse phrases, and collocations.\nAn illuminating chapter on the grammar of conversation, followed by an appendix\non contractions, concludes the body of the book. Naturally, it is in this last chapter\nthat spoken features are identi\u00aeed as highly current, and thus as part of a spoken\nstandard which in earlier works had often been (erroneously) labelled `non-standard'.\nSome readers might have expected more detailed discussion of such phenomena in\nthe previous chapters, but this is essentially an organizational decision made by the\nauthors. The book ends with a brief notes section, a bibliography, and two indexes.\nR EVI EWS 381\nFor a grammar of 1,200 pages, this is a very accessible and user-friendly book.\nBoth the lucid style and the transparent structure and, last but not least, layout\ndevices help accomplish this overall quality. Sensibly for instance, a four-page\ncontents summary is followed immediately by a detailed table of contents. Together\nwith a lexical index (of items discussed) and a conceptual index (of linguistic terms),\nthese help the readers \u00aend their way ef\u00aeciently through the book. A major advantage\nover the 1,800-page CGEL is that the chapter-internal organization is a great deal\nmore transparent. A structural parallelism was followed carefully in the design of\nthe major chapters and their subsections, thus providing (a) comparable results on\nall relevant grammatical levels (morphology, syntax, discourse) as well as (b) a\nconvenient overall picture of the four registers investigated: a qualitative description\nof the phenomenon under discussion is followed by authentic examples from\ndifferent registers. Quantitative corpus data (presented in illustrative \u00aegures and\ntables) and brief discussions of the \u00aendings conclude each section. It is easy to see\nthat the provision of normalized \u00aegures in bar and other diagrams makes it easier to\ncompare the host of data presented in this grammar, just as the provision of\nfrequency bands makes it easier to conceptually group and memorize the many\n\u00aendings. It is also true that a profusion of individual \u00aegures in each diagram or table\nwould be more distracting than helpful for the general readership. Nevertheless, it is\nequally certain that professional linguists would have welcomed access to the actual\n\u00aegures of occurrence (perhaps in an appendix or a separate notes section), since this\nwould enable them to compare their own \u00aendings more meticulously with those\npresented in this grammar and, just as important, work with the \u00aegures of the\nLGSWE. As it is, exact \u00aegures can often only be estimated and thus a good deal of\nthe tremendous amount of work that went into the writing and compilation of this\ngrammar cannot be fully exploited by the scienti\u00aec community. This is particularly\nregrettable because the LGSWE will indubitably stimulate a wealth of pertinent\nstudies.\nWith its stress on frequency information, deliberate omission of complex phrase-\nstructure diagrams, its lack of the generativist technical apparatus, and neglect of\nuniversal principles, this will probably not become the mentalist's favourite\ngrammar.3 Nevertheless, despite its language-speci\u00aec aims (and probably precisely\nbecause of its functional, non-technical approach, which is unlikely to be outdated\nwithin a decade), the LGSWE will set a standard also for future non-English\ngrammars \u00b1 a standard which it will be dif\u00aecult to match in the foreseeable future,\nthough, given the lack of similarly sophisticated corpora for other languages.\nFurthermore, various competing psycholinguistic schools, in particular cognitivist\nNLP approaches which rely heavily on probabilistic models, can be expected to\npro\u00aet greatly from the wealth of quantitative information provided here.\nThe LGSWE provides not only basic research for theoretical linguists. It is in\n3 It ought to be added that some basic phrase- and clause-structure diagrams do \u00aegure in the appropriate\nplaces of this work too (e.g. pp. 114, 123, 135f., 576f., 641). These follow the notational conventions of\n(systemic or traditional) functional grammar.\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS382\nparticular on the applied side where the future in\u00afuence of the LGSWE can hardly\nbe overestimated. Both \u00aerst- and second-language teaching materials will need to be\nrevised on the basis of this work. Again, the differentiation into registers will prove\nuseful for materials developers. The \u00aeeld of teaching English for academic purposes\n(EAP), for instance, can be put on a more solid foundation now that academic\nEnglish can be contrasted systematically with conversational English. Such materials\nare sorely needed since recent work has shown that a lack of stylistic sensitivity is\nprominent even among very advanced students. It should be kept in mind, however,\nthat few EFL and EAP teachers will be able to devise a course on the basis of the\n\u00aendings of the LGSWE. Psychometricians and trained materials developers \u00b1 whose\nfavourite work this should certainly become \u00b1 will need to collaborate to devise\nmaximally ef\u00aecient courses. Needless to say, these materials will have to be highly\nvaried depending on such factors as participants, purposes, and period of exposure\nto formal teaching. A \u00aerst step in this direction will be the shorter student grammar\nbased on the present work (Biber et al. forthcoming), which is due to come out\nshortly together with a workbook.\nWhat the present reviewer misses most are detailed qualitative analyses and\ntheoretical discussions. But \u00b1 and this was a surprise to the authors of the grammar\ntoo (Douglas Biber, personal communication) \u00b1 it is surprising how few sophisti-\ncated studies involving complex arguments can be incorporated even in a large-scale\ngrammar if the overall balance and a fourfold register differentiation is to be carried\nout consistently. Paradigmatic, more detailed discussions such as that on the\nconstructional principles of spoken grammar (pp. 1,066\u00b11,108) can therefore only\noccur sporadically. Different linguists consulting this grammar while expecting \u00aenal,\nquantitatively `veri\u00aeed' answers to individual aspects will thus often be (a) disap-\npointed or irritated at the complexity of matters, (b) happy to see that their work\nhas not been \u00aenished, and\/or (c) realize that such answers will probably not exist for\nthe time being. The authors are not unaware of this fact: nowhere do they pretend to\nhave written a `comprehensive' or even `complete' grammar ( just compare the title\nof this work and that of its predecessor) \u00b1 despite 1,200-odd pages. Writing a truly\ncomprehensive grammar would surely go even beyond Otto Jespersen's imagination.\nGiven our current knowledge of variationist factors, it would need to combine\nquantitative information on register, dialectal and social variation with detailed\nqualitative analysis; and it should also provide at least super\u00aecial coverage of\nongoing changes. While such a uni\u00aeed account of grammar and variation would\ncertainly be a fascinating enterprise, it could probably only be realised in a ten-\nvolume grammar project spanning twenty years and involving at least thirty\nresearchers. Current sponsoring is unfortunately more short-term oriented; the six\nyears allotted for the LGSWE already represent what is considered a `long-term'\nlinguistic project. There is hope, though. Most importantly, the lead author of the\npresent grammar can boast expertise in all of the above \u00aeelds. Secondly, Longman\nhas proven to be happy to foster long-term collaborations. After all, it took over\ntwo decades for the CGEL (Quirk et al. 1985) to evolve after work had started on\nR EVI EWS 383\nthe Grammar of contemporary English (Quirk et al., 1972) in the 1960s. Future\nrevisions and extensions to the present work are therefore not inconceivable.\nAmongst its many merits perhaps the highest distinction of this grammar lies not\nso much within the book itself but in the fresh methodological impetus that it gives\nto the disciplines of English linguistics and grammar writing more globally. Hence it\nis also quite appropriate to consider the LGSWE as the solid starting point of more\n\u00aene-grained individual future studies. This is what makes a truly seminal work. The\nLGSWE is an excellent source for distinguishing central from marginal aspects of\ngrammar; it is methodologically sound and very accessible given the wealth of\ninformation provided. Reference grammars by de\u00aenition cover the central aspects\n\u00aerst, and the LGSWE is no exception. Fortunately, we are occasionally offered gems\non individual low-frequency phenomena, which reminds us of the important insight\nthat both central and marginal aspects can be descriptively and theoretically\nrewarding in linguistics.\nIn conclusion, Biber et al. do not only provide answers to many burning issues,\nbut raise perhaps even more interesting questions by revealing potentially fruitful\nareas of research. The full value and impact of the LGSWE will thus only become\napparent in the quality of future linguistic work, pedagogical materials, and\nreference grammars for languages other than English. No doubt, then, due to its\nscope and novel approach, this will be one of the most often cited works in English\nlinguistics in the \u00aerst part of the twenty-\u00aerst century. It is furthermore safe to predict\nthat this grammar will be a \u00aerst source for frequency-oriented corpus linguists, some\nof whom one can imagine using Bibal in their word-processors as shorthand for the\nlong list of authors while implying the meaning of its homophone.\nReviewer's address:\nAlbert-Ludwigs-Universita\u00c8t Freiburg\nEnglisches Seminar\nPostfach\nD-79085 Freiburg, Germany\nManfred.Krug@anglistik.uni-freiburg.de\nReferences\nBiber, D.

Cambridge: Cam-\nbridge University Press, 2000. Pp. xi + 309. Hardback \u00a342.50. ISBN 0 521 47280 6.\nReviewed by Charles Jones, University of Edinburgh\nThis important book takes forward the claims of a Lexical Phonology (LP) model\non a number of fronts. As one might by now expect, it proposes a set of more\n`concrete lexicalist analyses' for phonological phenomena than those which are\nusually put forward by adherents of the Sound Pattern of English (SPE) framework.\nIn particular, McMahon proposes a variety of additional constraints to the (already\nhighly constrained versions of the) LP model, in the course of which she effectively\ncriticizes the SPE model in particular for its over-riding reliance upon generality,\neconomy, abstractness, and simplicity metrics to an extent which makes it unrespon-\nsive to criteria for learnability or psychological reality. As a counter to some of the\nalmost grotesque derivational histories claimed by scholars like Monahan and Halle\nto underpin certain surface alternants, McMahon proposes a stratum-reduced level\nof LP, where Level 1 rules are limited to derived environments and lexical rules\nthemselves constrained to apply to Level 1 (and then only once). Such additional\nconstraints will, in their turn, lead to underlying representations for alternant forms\nwhich will be equivalent \u00b1 or certainly closer \u00b1 to the lexical representation of the\nunderived member of the alternating pair. Important consequences will be a closer\nmatch with learnability criteria and the production of an optimal grammar in\nacquisitional terms.\nThe book sets out to explore the implications of this heavily constrained LP\nmodel as a tool for explaining mechanisms of phonological change on the one hand\nand, on the other, to assess the relevance of historical change for synchronic\nalternations in the phonology. There are two thrusts to her arguments. In the \u00aerst\ninstance, phonological alternants like the English Vowel Shift (EVS) are explained in\nLP terms as `natural' phonological occurrences, without recourse to any inherent\nappeal to rule processes and sequences identical to the historical phonological events\nwhich produce them. McMahon convincingly shows that the EVS can be character-\nized as having a phonological life cycle of a type which can be attested elsewhere and\nwhich need not equate with the same rules and rule sequences which are traditionally\nclaimed to underpin real-time historical events. By this means she is able to by-pass\nthe problem, inherent in SPE frameworks, of how the modern language user is able\nto recover historical processes like EVS and Middle English Open Syllable Length-\nening (MEOSL). Among other devices, she achieves this goal by postulating under-\nlying diphthongs for the divine and profound types, the divinity and profundity forms\nbeing produced through monophthongization rules where lax vowels lose a timing\nslot. Likewise, reduce\/reduction both share an underlying [ ju] while study\/studious\nshow an underlying [\u00c3]. Their surface alternants are shown to be explainable without\nreliance upon purely historical rule events, but can be arrived at through synchronic\nR EVI EWS 385\nrules such as laxing, raising, and lengthening, rules which, although typical of\nhistoric accounts of the EVS, are now applied in a way which does not have to\ncorrespond to their historical strict domain or sequencing. Indeed, McMahon claims\nthat `It seems that synchronic phonological rules need not, and indeed cannot be\nidentical to their historical sources in a constrained lexical model' (p. 125). Above\nall, she successfully demonstrates how a major and positive consequence of the type\nof constrained LP model she advocates will be the prohibition of unjusti\u00aeably\nmaximally simple phonologies of the SPE type; so that her Vowel Shift Rule (VSR)\ninterpretation involves two rule processes against SPE's one, with all the lexical rules\noperating solely on Level 1, in consequence eliminating the need for free-ride\nsolutions.\nHowever, there is another side to the coin; the past should also be able to help us\nunderstand the present. To demonstrate this she concentrates upon two major\nphonological processes in the history of English \u00b1 the Scots Vowel Length Rule\n(SVLR) and [r] loss, insertion, and deletion. In both instances she shows convin-\ncingly how there is a progression from what was a gradual sound change (in the case\nof the SVLR a Low-Level Lengthening Rule in voiced contexts; in the case of [r] a\ngradual weakening of the sonorant in coda positions) through Rule Inversion to\nlexical reassignment. This kind of phonological process \u00b1 from phonological\nconditioning through phonological rule to grammaticalization \u00b1 has, of course,\noften been noted before in the literature, but the positing of this phonological life\ncycle within a constrained LP model as a post-lexical to lexical process is perhaps\nnovel. The SVLR, for instance, begins life as a low-level lengthening rule, which in\nturn produces a rule inversion whereby all vowels which were previously under-\nlyingly short now become long by phonological rule, leading in turn to a reassign-\nment of length to some of the diphthongal forms in the phonology. So too [r], where\nan initial low-level weakening and deletion in coda positions produces a rule\ninversion, in turn giving rise to [r] insertion. Such a process, she demonstrates, leads\nto the relexicalization of words like `spar' and `war' as having no underlying [r].\nImportantly, though, both these processes, while active in the synchronic phonology,\nmirror historic rule sequencing.\nThroughout, McMahon argues for the interconnection between the phonological\npast and phonological present: `a constrained, rule-based, derivational model makes\ntestible predictions on the course sound changes follow, as they develop from low-\nlevel variation into post-lexical and then lexical rules. This is not the same as the\nrecapitulation of history found in SGP [Standard Generative Phonology], where\nsound changes and phonological rules were essentially identical; instead variant\npathways into the grammar are determined by issues of learnability and by the\nconstraints on the model . . . Apparently arbitrary present-day processes can equally\nbe shown to be explicable in a diachronic perspective' (p. 283).\nThere are, needless to say, some concerns about McMahon's claims. While one\nmight accept that for the divine\/divinity alternation an underlying [ai] diphthong\ncould be postulated, the monophthongization process which this has to undergo to\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS386\nachieve the divinity output is not well motivated and looks somewhat process\nspeci\u00aec. One would need to be shown how it might equate with other `smoothing'\nprocesses in the historical phonology (e.g. the [eo] to [oo] and [au] to [OO] types and\nothers). And what does she mean by `degree of prominence' in such cases \u00b1 is it\ninterdependency between the segments (and how would a LP handle this?) or has it\nto do with `inherent' vowel prominence or relative vowel sonority (and how would\nan LP deal with this?). A particular worry in McMahon's account of the EVS, and\none popular with LP adherents, is the suggestion that some surface alternants are a\nconsequence of (or at least can be reinforced and maintained by) orthographic\nconsiderations. Such criteria McMahon proposes as possible motivators\/sustainers\nfor [r] insertion as well. In historical terms this kind of argument involves all kinds\nof assumptions about levels of literacy but, regardless of that, proposals of this type\nneed considerably greater degrees of testing before they can be generally accepted.\nIf, as she rightly claims, the past can be used to explain the present, then we must\nbe absolutely certain that the facts we have about the past are as complete as they\npossibly can be. McMahon claims, for example, that [ j] insertion never occurs in the\nlanguage post [r, w, dZ, S], but Tuite (1726) records it in items such as bruise, juice,\ncruise, fruit, rude among many others, all he claims showing `long u', i.e. [ ju].\nLikewise her discussions in this area might have looked at the Scottish dialectal\nareas where [ j] insertion is much more pronounced than RP, showing the phenom-\nenon in words like book, hook, etc.\nThe relative paucity of detailed historical data shows itself too in her discussion of\n[r]. In several places she argues that statements by several eighteenth-century\nobservers that [r] is never lost doesn't re\u00afect the facts on the ground but merely their\nprescriptive preference, which often limits their observations of ongoing change.\nThis is surely too simple a view to take of the status of the late Modern evidence (not\nall of which is prescriptive). Even in that which is heavily so \u00b1 for example H. W.\nSavage's The Vulgarities and Improprieties of the English Language (1833) \u00b1 there is\nevidence to show how complex the situation is concerning [r]. Savage's careful\nevidence shows that [r] loss is far from universally stigmatized and also, like it, [r]\nintrusion is often a characteristic of `the custom of good society', and `the custom of\neducated society', citing examples of such as hawkwud `awkward' (vulgarly,\nhawkerd); subbeltun `subaltern' (vulgarly subhaultern); blornemornje `blancmange',\nfracar `fracas', purtaytuz `potatoes', orgust `august'. Interestingly, he appears to\nrecord only a single linking [r] instance: I saw rim.\nIt is most unfortunate that this (not inexpensive) book is marred by crass\nproduction errors, arising, it would appear, through major failures in font-reading\nsoftware systems. That such blemishes should appear in a prestigious series like this\nsays little for the standards of a Press which makes public claims for the excellence\nof its productions. One can only imagine the angst suffered by the author.\nFortunately, the great strengths of McMahon's case are left unaffected, and this\nbook will add considerably to the ongoing debate about the interrelation between\nphonological change and phonological modelling.\nR EVI EWS 387\nReviewer's address\nDepartment of English Language\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nDavid Hume Tower\nGeorge Square\nEdinburgh EH8 9JX\nelacjs@srv.arts\u00f9.ed.ac.uk\n(Received 12 March 2002)\nDOI: 10.1017\/S1360674302230282\nHeinz J.

Hardback\n\u00a347.50, ISBN 0 521 55412 8.\nReviewed by Francis Katamba, Lancaster University\nThis is a book on Lexical Phonology (LP) which specialists in English language as\nwell as theoretical linguists will \u00aend provocative, informative, and highly rewarding.\nUsing data mostly taken from English and supplemented with examples drawn from\nGerman, Giegerich explores the interplay between morphology and phonology in\nregulating phonological alternations. At a time when Optimality Theory and other\nconstraint-based approaches appear to have swept all before them, Giegerich offers\nus a derivationalist alternative in the shape of a coherent and highly constrained\ntheory of `base-driven' LP.\nThe opening chapter paints the background against which the book is to be read.\nIt is a look back to Gussmann's review of Mohanan (1986), the \u00aerst mainstream\nmonograph on LP. That review lambasted Mohanan's book which, according to\nGussmann, contained many bad analyses and suffered from major structural \u00afaws\nthat stemmed from LP's impoverished view of morphology. Gussmann contended\nthat if his criticisms were accepted `Mohanan's book would very likely come to\nstand as a requiem for Lexical Phonology' (Gussmann, 1988: 239).\nGiegerich's book mounts a robust defence of LP and shows that any thoughts of a\nrequiem for LP are premature. While recognizing the problems with Mohanan's\nanalysis, Giegerich demonstrates that in fact they were not endemic in all versions of\nthe theory that existed in the 1980s (e.g. Kiparsky, 1982). Moreover, those\nweaknesses that were present in the best versions of the 1980s model can be\novercome without jettisoning its basic insight, namely the hypothesis that morpholo-\ngical and phonological rules apply in tandem in the lexicon, regulated by the\nprinciple of `lexical strati\u00aecation' (or `level ordering').\nUnfortunately, lexical strati\u00aecation raises many problems for which so far there\nhave been no satisfactory answers, such as: how many strata are needed? What\nmorphological and phonological properties belong to a particular stratum? On what\nbasis is this determined? Are strati\u00aecation principles part of Universal Grammar?\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS388\nThe lack of both clarity and unanimity in the answers given to such questions by\npractitioners of LP has thrown the whole enterprise into disarray. For instance, as\nseen in the table below, there is agreement neither on the number of strata required\nin the lexicon of English nor on the stratum at which particular phenomena should\nbe placed.\nKiparsky (1982) Halle and Mohanan (1985)\nMohanan (1986)\nStratum 1 `+'-af\u00aexation: -ity, -ic `+'-af\u00aexation: -ity, -ic\nirregular in\u00afexion: cacti, oxen irregular in\u00afexion: cacti, oxen\nStratum 2 `#'-af\u00aexation: -ness, -less, `#'-af\u00aexation: -ness, -less,\ncompounding\nStratum 3 regular in\u00afexion compounding\nStratum 4 \u00b1 regular in\u00afexion\nIn order to handle the interaction between `#'-af\u00aexation and compounding,\nMohanan proposed what was to become a highly questionable device, namely a\n`loop' that enables morphology to look back from stratum 3, where compounding\ntook place to form a word like the verb aircondition, to stratum 2 where regular `#'-\naf\u00aexation takes place to derive re-aircondition. This loop totally undermines the\ninsight of LP that morphological and phonological rules of the same stratum apply\nin tandem. Earlier, Kiparsky (1982) had also been forced to allow a retracing of\nsteps from stratum 3 back to stratum 2 in order to handle cases where regular\nin\u00afection appears inside compounds (e.g. systems analyst).\nAnother objection to Mohanan's model was that it allowed excessively abstract\nanalyses. LP (Kiparsky, 1982) and its precursors (Kean, 1974; Mascaro\u00c2 , 1976) had\nstriven to exclude excessively abstract analyses by using the Strict Cycle Condition\n(SCC) which always restricted structure-changing rules to applying in derived\nenvironments. Halle and Mohanan (1985) and Mohanan (1986) relaxed this\nrequirement so that rules of Vowel Shift and Vowel Reduction could apply\nwherever it was expedient to allow them to apply. A major objective of Giegerich's\nbook is to revert to a more constrained model where the Strict Cycle Condition is\nrigidly adhered to.\nChapter 2 puts the weaknesses of early LP under the microscope. According to\nGiegerich, LP got into trouble because it was based on a number of erroneous\nassumptions. Chief among these was `af\u00aex-driven' strati\u00aecation (cf. the table above).\nThe strata are de\u00aened on the basis of af\u00aexes that are attached at a particular\nstratum. But af\u00aexes are a very poor diagnostic test for lexical strata. The diagnostic\nuselessness of af\u00aexes in determining lexical strata is shown to be due to the fact that\nmany derivational af\u00aexes defy any attempt to pin them down to a single stratum.\nDual membership suf\u00aexes include famous examples like -able\/-ible and -ant\/-ent as\nwell as numerous less well-known ones such as agentive -er which is normally\nR EVI EWS 389\nstratum 2, and attaches to words as in singer and worker, but is stratum 1 in a few\ncases, e.g. adulterer and presbyter, and attaches to bound roots on stratum 1. The\nsame is true of adjective forming -y. It is normally stratum 2 and attaches to words\n(e.g. sunny, funny) but can also occasionally be found on stratum 1 where it attaches\nto bound roots (e.g. holy, dizzy, \u00afimsy). In all, the behaviour of well over a dozen\ndual membership derivational af\u00aexes is presented, enough to convince even the most\ndetermined defender of af\u00aex-driven strati\u00aecation that a fundamental rethink is\nneeded.\nIn chapter 3 Giegerich presents the theory of `base-driven strati\u00aecation' which\nmaintains the insight of a strati\u00aeed lexicon while at the same time avoiding the\npitfalls of af\u00aex-driven strati\u00aecation. The criteria used to de\u00aene strata relate to the\nproperties of af\u00aexation bases, rather than af\u00aexes. In English stratum 1 is root-based\nand stratum 2 word-based. This means that the input of stratum 2 must be a word;\nthe input of stratum 1 is a root \u00b1 which may or may not be a word. The number of\nstrata required in the grammar of any language is an empirical issue determined on\nthe basis of the behaviour of its bases. Thus, while two strata are suf\u00aecient for\nEnglish, German requires three strata whose inputs are respectively the root, stem,\nand word.\nThe hallmarks of stratum 1 are noncompositionality and non-productivity (cf.\nmaternity, fraternity, fraternize). Hence, Giegerich proposes, no general word-\nformation rules are available at stratum 1. The linguist must list all stratum 1 roots\n(both simple and complex) as well as af\u00aexes as lexical entries. Sceptics may retort\nthat, true, there is a case for listing this at stratum 1, but the problem of\nnonproductivity and noncompositionality is a cline. A more nuanced solution would\nre\u00afect, for example, that there is some degree of predictability in the result of\nstratum 1 suf\u00aexation of -ity.\nIn this theory nonaf\u00aex inputs to stratum 1 are all members of the category root,\nwhich has a novel de\u00aenition. While the traditional view is that the root is the core\nthat remains when all af\u00aexes are stripped away (Lyons, 1970: 325), Giegerich's root\nmay be a morphologically simplex form (e.g. lamp-, gorm-, moll-) or a complex one,\nwhere the complexity is the result of stratum 1 morphology yielding a base (e.g.\nsensation, nation, fraction) which can be expanded to form a word (e.g. sensational-\nity, nation-al, fraction-al).\nFollowing Selkirk (1982), Giegerich assumes that unlike words, roots are not\nmembers of lexical categories. Rather than arbitrarily characterize moll- as an\nadjective and gorm- as a noun, Giegerich proposes that the grammar should be\nassumed to have a root-to-word conversion rule which assigns word status, and\nhence word class labels, to lexical category-free roots as they exit stratum 1 and\nenter stratum 2, thereby acquiring word status. The rule takes this form:\n(1) [ ]r! [[ ] r]L (L = N,V,A)\nIt is not possible to predict if a given root is subject to the root-to-word rule. A\nbound root like matern- is not, but a free root like modern is. So, each root must be\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS390\ndiacritically marked to indicate whether it can become a word at that point and\nwhat lexical category it will belong to. Unsatisfactory though it is from the point of\nview of capturing a generalization, Giegerich sees no way round the problem other\nthan listing, since no mechanism exists for predicting why modern is free but matern-\nis bound. Derivational af\u00aexes also have diacritic marking to indicate the lexical\ncategory of words formed by attaching them. Thus, -ity is marked as forming nouns\nand -ize as yielding verbs.\nBlocking plays the usual role in a strati\u00aeed lexicon. While lioness is the female\nlion, dogess is not what we call a female dog. The stratum 2 form ending in -ess is\nblocked in the latter case by the prior existence of bitch.\nThe stratal af\u00aeliation of af\u00aexes is handled thus: basic roots as well as af\u00aexes are\ntreated as lexical entries. For each root the grammar indicates the af\u00aexes that are\nallowed to attach to it as in (2a); for each af\u00aex the grammar lists the af\u00aexes it can\nhave attached to it \u00b1 or whether it yields a word as shown in (2b):\n(2) (a) ! -al (b) ! -ize\nmatern\nn\n! -ity -al ! -ity\n(\n! Adj (rule (1))\nmoll ! -ify -ade ! Adj (rule (1))\ngorm ! -less -ity ! Adj (rule (1))\nThis makes it unnecessary to mark each rule with a diacritic showing the level at\nwhich it applies, as was previously the case.\nThe two strata of English are characterized by a clustering of interrelated proper-\nties. For instance, stratum 1 morphology displays phonological properties which are\nnot shared with stratum 2 such as stress alternations (a\u00c2tom\u00b1ato\u00c2mic), syllabicity\nalternations (rhythm\u00b1rhythmic), and phonological rules restricted to this stratum\nsuch as trisyllabic laxing (de\u00aene\u00b1de\u00aenition).\nBase-driven LP does not completely succeed in banishing all overlap between\nstrata. Giegerich subscribes to the `Continuity of Strata Hypothesis' (Mohanan,\n1986: 46) which envisages migration between two adjacent strata. For instance, the\nformation of abstract nouns using the suf\u00aex -th (as in warmth) is said to have moved\nfrom stratum 2 to stratum 1 when this mode of word formation ceased being\nproductive.\nChapter 4 turns to the phonological side of Lexical Phonology and examines it in\nrelation to a number of phenomena. The main focus is the role of Strict Cyclicity in\nexcluding excessively abstract analyses. Structure-changing rules are allowed to\napply in underived environments only on the \u00aenal stratum. The Strict Cyclicity\nEffect is applicable at all earlier strata (stratum 1 in the case of English), but the \u00aenal\nlexical stratum (for English stratum 2) is not subject to this requirement. There is a\nstrong tendency (rooted in learnability) to require stratum 2 to be subject to the\nAlternation Condition (AC). Alternations resulting in violations of AC may be\nremoved from stratum 2 by rule inversion. A case in point is the well-known -n\/zero\nalternation in forms such as autumn\u00b1autumnal, column\u00b1columnar. This alternation is\nR EVI EWS 391\nhandled at stratum 2 by Mohanan (1986: 22), Kaisse and Shaw (1985: 23), and\nKiparsky (1985: 89):\n(3) mn-simpli\u00aecation\n\/n\/! \u00f9\/m__]\nGiegerich reanalyses mn-simpli\u00aecation as a highly restricted stratum 1 rule. Histori-\ncally it was a stratum 2 deletion rule but he demonstrates how it has been the subject\nof rule inversion resulting in its reinterpretation as a sporadic stratum 1 insertion\nrule whose inputs are recognized with the help of clues from the orthography.\nContinuing with the theme of the relevance of the orthography in positing\nunderlying representations, chapter 5 deals with phonology and the literate speaker,\nfocusing on schwa. Giegerich considers what at \u00aerst sight appear to be nonproble-\nmatic word pairs which fall into two groups:\n(4) (a) real\u00b1reality, atom\u00b1atomic, hostile\u00b1hostility, autumn\u00b1autumnal\n(b) deter\u00b1deterrent, myrrh\u00b1myrrhic, recur\u00b1recurrent\nIn (4a) all the simple morphological forms have unstressed [@] as their \u00aenal vowel\nwhile in (4b) (in RP) they have the stressed variant of schwa, namely [z:] as their\n\u00aenal vowel. The corresponding complex morphological forms, however, have one of\nthe lax vowels [a e i o u] in the same position.\nData of this kind illustrate a key problem that besets derivational approaches\nwhich has led many linguists to abandon them: frequently there is a lack of\nplausible underlying representations that can be matched systematically by rules\nwith surface representations. Here Giegerich claims the problem can be solved if the\ncorrelation between the phonological and orthographic representations of, say,\n[{t@m] atom and [{t\u00a1mIk] atomic is taken into account. It is claimed that for\nliterate speakers some underlying representations are based on orthographic\nrepresentations. These words contain a schwa whose underlier is a blank syllable\nnucleus which is \u00aelled by one of the vowels [a e i o u] with the selection being\ndetermined on the basis of spelling. The proposal does work. But at a cost. It\nexpands enormously the information that is drawn upon in formulating underlying\nrepresentations.\nChapter 6 deals with syllabi\u00aecation. Giegerich defends the claim that [r]-sandhi\n(both intrusive [r], as in draw[r]ing and linking [r], as in draw[r] it) in RP is a single\nphenomenon analogous to the [ j]-sandhi that occurs in say it and the [w]-sandhi in\nshow it. And all three are instances of liaison: empty syllable onsets are \u00aelled with\nmelodic elements belonging to the \u00aenal segment of the preceding rhyme. The\nalternative account where linking [r]-sandhi is the result of the nonapplication of a\nrule deleting coda \/r\/ is rejected. Also dismissed is the treatment of any form of\n[r]-sandhi as a case of insertion. This is because an insertion analysis \u00afounders when\nthe motivation for the inserted sound being [r], rather than any other sound, is\nsought.\nIt is further argued that the pattern of complementary distribution shown in\nnonrhotic accents like RP suggests that in the rhyme [r] and schwa are surface\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS392\nmanifestations of the same underlier which is an `empty' nuclear melody. Blank-\n\u00aelling rules predict the actual realization of the \u00aeller, which is schwa if it is syllabi\u00aeed\nas part of the rhyme and [r] if it is in onset position. The fact that linking [r] is used\nfreely while intrusive [r] is not is accounted for by the social stigma attached to the\nlatter.\nThis analysis of [r] is certainly ingenious. But it is also controversial. An\nalternative view which to me seems to be better grounded in phonetics is that\nproposed by Gimson who treats linking [r] as coda [r] and distinguishes it from onset\n[r]. This is because phonetically and historically linking [r] belongs to the rhyme of\nthe \u00aerst syllable and does not form the onset of the second. For example, `the \/r\/ of\nmore ice \/mO:r \u00a9aIs\/ is shorter than that of more rice \/mO: \u00a9raIs\/, the latter also being\nassociated with accent onset and possible pitch change' (Gimson, 2001: 289).\nGiegerich's analysis is dif\u00aecult to square with the phonetic facts.\nChapter 7 examines the underlying vowels of RP. Topics covered include input\nvowels to [r]-sandhi in RP and London English. The familiar assumption is made\nthat English vowels fall into the two categories tense and lax. The former are\nassociated with two skeletal positions and the latter with just one. The most\ninteresting issue addressed is the representation of centring diphthongs. RP [@]\noccurring as the second element of a diphthong is a surface realization of an\nunderspeci\u00aeed (0) skeletal position associated only with the feature [+sonorant]. If\nthat skeletal position is assigned to the rhyme, it surfaces as [@]. Tenseness is only\ncontrastive for nonlow vowels as low vowels cannot be tense. Furthermore, as seen\nabove, it is claimed that [@] and [r] have the same underlier represented as the empty\nmelody [0].\nThe closing chapter deals with the interaction between syllabi\u00aecation principles\nand lexical strata. Giegerich demonstrates that syllabi\u00aecation has a number of\nstratum-speci\u00aec characteristics though the general mechanisms that apply\nthroughout a derivation are the same. Two of the important \u00aendings made are the\nfollowing: \u00aerst, stratum 1 automatically produces alternations where root-\u00aenal\nconsonants are nonsyllabic, unlike in the morphologically simple surface form (cf.\ncylinder\u00b1cylindric, baptism\u00b1baptismal in English, and in German Zylinder\u00b1zylindrisch,\nFilter-\u00aeltrier(en)). Second, on later strata such alternation is not automatic. In\nEnglish the rhyme condition guarantees such alternations do not occur on stratum\n2, as all relevant clusters are syllabi\u00aeed on this stratum. A sonorant consonant\npreceding the right-hand bracket of a syllable is incorporated in the rhyme:\n(5) English Rhyme Condition (stratum 2)\nR\n|\nx\n|\n[+consonantal]\n\u0014\n+ consonantal\n\u0015\n+ sonorant ]\nThe theory predicts that the disyllabic noun kindling belongs to stratum 1 but the\nR EVI EWS 393\ntrisyllabic participle kindling belongs to stratum 2. The phonological analysis is\ncorroborated morphologically by the semantic noncompositionality of the former\nand the semantic compositionality of the latter. This is neat.\nIn conclusion, the book contains many excellent analyses of central topics in\nEnglish phonology and morphology. Base-driven LP breathes new life into deriva-\ntionalist approaches. Will it stop linguists abandoning derivational models? Prob-\nably not. The crucial argument against derivations is that all too often, knowing\nwhat the underlying representation is does not help one predict how it is going to be\nmapped on the phonetic representation. In the case of schwa, mentioned above, the\nproblem might be circumvented if we follow Giegerich and use orthographic\ninformation. But that will still leave many situations where such a solution is not\nviable. This is particularly true of stress phenomena. Pairs of words with similar\nsegmental structures are often assigned very different stress patterns, as in the\nexamples below cited by Burzio (1996: 125) when arguing for surface constraints on\noutputs instead of derivations:\n(6) (a) ho\u00c2nest\/*hone\u00c2st; robu\u00c2st\/*robu\u00c2st\n(b) o\u00c2rchestra\/*orche\u00c2stra; asbe\u00c2stos\/*a\u00c2sbestos\nThe challenge is to see how base-driven LP deals with such problems.\nReviewer's address:\nDepartment of Linguistics and Modern English Language\nLancaster University\nBowland College\nLancaster University\nLancaster LA1 4YT\nf.katamba@lancaster.ac.uk\nReferences\nBurzio, L.

It is apparent from the papers that authors were able to refer to post-\n1997 sources in their papers, which is of interest in a \u00aeeld as fast-moving as English\nhistorical linguistics. (One of the articles even takes account of work in the \u00aeeld from\nas late as 2000.)\nTwo of the editors, Olga Fischer and Anette Rosenbach, have provided a lengthy\nintroduction to the volume (pp. 1\u00b137). They note that one advantage that English\noffers in the study of grammaticalization is that the language has `a well-attested\nwritten history' or `at least some historical evidence is available' (p. 7). The second\nstatement seems a little on the cautious side from a comparative point of view, for\nthere are probably not many other languages whose history can be studied on the\nbasis of authentic diachronic material to the extent that this is possible in the case of\nEnglish. Using authentic historical material, with precise dates of occurrence given,\nto draw conclusions about the historical development of the language is certainly a\nfeature of most of the papers in the present volume.\nThe editors have not sought to group the articles thematically. Instead, the articles\nare arranged alphabetically, on the basis of the author's last name. However, certain\nthematic preoccupations or similarities in approach do emerge in the book. For\ninstance, there are some studies in the book that can be viewed in relation to\nElizabeth Traugott's (1982: 247 ff.) seminal idea that in the study of linguistic\nchange it is useful to identify a dimension of meaning, or of functional-semantic\nlevels, that runs from the propositional to the textual and the expressive. One of\nthese studies is Minoji Akimoto's article on the verb pray (`The grammaticalization\nof the verb ``pray'' '). The paper is exemplary in the way the author follows the use\nof the verb from the \u00aefteenth to the nineteenth century, based on clearly identi\u00aeed\nR EVI EWS 395\ncorpora drawn from the successive centuries. The author identi\u00aees the courtesy\nmarker pray for analysis as part of the paper and includes comments on the\nintriguing question of how and why an expression may disappear.\nUrsula Lenker (`Sothlice and witodlice: discourse markers in Old English') does\nnot focus on the question of disappearance to the extent that Akimoto does, but\nshows how Elizabeth Traugott's (1995) cline `clause-internal adverbial > sentence\nadverbial > discourse particle' (p. 229) is useful in the analysis of the two adverbs in\nOld English.\nSylvia Adamson (`A lovely little example: word order options and category shift\nin the premodifying string') examines how the meaning and the use of the word\nlovely has changed from Old English (lu\u00afic) to the present day and how such change\nis connected to word order patterns of premodifying adjectives in noun phrases. As\nshe observes, the Old English adjective had the sense of `loving', belonging to the\nsemantic type `human propensity'. Later in Middle English the adjective took on\nthe sense of `physically beautiful', a sense which `became a dominant one' in the\neighteenth century (p. 48). This sense Adamson views as being of the type\n`physical property'. In the nineteenth century the adjective acquired the sense of\na `value' adjective, `expressing the speaker's approval' (p. 48). Adjectives of these\nthree semantic types have different slots in sequences of prenominal adjectives in\nnoun phrases, and the semantic changes that the adjective has undergone can be\nconnected to shifts in the position of the adjective in such clusters. In the latter half\nof the nineteenth century the word acquired a use as an intensi\u00aeer, as in lovely quiet\nengine, where it occurs in front of another adjective. From this there emerges a new\ncline for the analysis of grammaticalization: descriptive adjective > affective\nadjective > intensi\u00aeer (p. 55). In present-day English the word also has a use as a\npragmatic particle, as Adamson observes in a note (`I'll arrive at six thirty.'\n`Lovely.') (p. 62).\nThe analysis of lovely is illuminating, even though the reader may wonder\nwhether a strict semantic separation of the `physical beauty' sense and of the\n`approval' sense is always feasible or appropriate. Regarding the data for the study,\nAdamson, needing a large database, decided to rely largely on the quotation base of\nthe OED (p. 51). This is a good database to use, but one or more of the Chadwyck-\nHealey databases from recent centuries might perhaps also have been worth\nconsulting, at least for the sake of comparison. These databases have increasingly\nshown their value in work requiring large samples of authentic material from recent\ncenturies.\nOf the articles in the volume that bear even more directly on the syntax\u00b1semantics\ninterface in the analysis of English, two may be mentioned here. David Denison's\ncontribution (`Combining English auxiliaries') is closely argued and rich in data and\nanalysis. One of the important points in the article concerns the dating of the\nintroduction of the progressive in combinations with be Adj and be NP, of the type\nHe was being stupid\/a fool. A crucial piece of evidence turns on the analysis of\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS396\nsentences of the type but this is being wicked, for wickedness sake (1761, from\nJohnston, Chrysal). Denison points out that the be in the sentence is the equative be,\nnot the progressive be, which means that the example cannot be used as evidence for\ndating the progressive (pp. 132f.). The earliest modern example of the relevant type\nknown so far is therefore Jespersen's You will be glad to hear . . . how diligent I have\nbeen, and am being (1819, from Keats, Letters) (p. 133). The point is also important\nfrom the point of view of the passive pattern of The house was being built, as\nDenison points out (p. 134).\nOlga Fischer's contribution (`Grammaticalisation: unidirectional, non-reversable?\nThe case of to before the in\u00aenitive in English') is an important one, both from the\npoint of view of the history of English and from the point of view of the concept of\ngrammaticalization more generally. A central objective of the paper is to show that\nwhile to in front of in\u00aenitives was undergoing grammaticalization in the period from\nOld English to early Middle English, as manifested for instance in the strengthening\nof to by for and in the loss of semantic integrity (pp. 155\u00b17), the process came to a\nstop and indeed reversed itself later (p. 158). In support, she argues that there were\nnew developments, including the appearance of split in\u00aenitives, from the fourteenth\ncentury onwards, and that `to went back to its original meaning, again strongly\nexpressing goal or direction (there is some difference with Old English usage . . .)'\n(p. 158). She views the to in to in\u00aenitives `as a kind of shift-of-tense element' (p. 162),\nas in Alex saw Julia to have been in a hurry when she dressed . . ., and suggests that\nthe in\u00aenitival to has become `more isomorphic again with the preposition to'\n(p. 163).\nAt the same time, in the introduction of the book the author and Anette\nRosenbach note that the in\u00aenitival to `does not change its grammatical status as an\nin\u00aenitival marker' (p. 22), and from the point of view of present-day English, the\nisomorphism that Fischer hypothesizes should not be exaggerated. It is worth\nadding here that the to -ing pattern, as in John objected to paying the bill, where the\nto is a preposition, needs to be kept separate from the to in\u00aenitival pattern (cf.\nRudanko, 1996: 58ff.). Indeed the to -ing pattern has been something of a rival to\nthe to in\u00aenitival pattern in recent centuries, with the former winning ground at the\nexpense of the latter (cf. Denison, 1998: 266; Rudanko, 1998: 11ff.).\nThe comments offered here concern what the present reviewer views as some of\nthe highlights of the book. Most of the other articles, including those by Guohua\nChen (`The grammaticalization of concessive markers in Early Modern English'),\nSusan Fitzmaurice (`Remarks on the de-grammaticalisation of in\u00aenitival to in\npresent-day American English'), and R. Molencki (`Parallelism vs. asymmetry: the\ncase of English counterfactual conditionals'), likewise explore aspects of English and\nof grammaticalization on the basis of well-chosen authentic data in an illuminating\nway and are worth reading. Those working on grammaticalization, on the history of\nEnglish, or even on the structure of present-day English, will certainly want to read\nthis book.\nR EVI EWS 397\nReviewer's address:\nDepartment of English\nUniversity of Tampere\nP.O.

Pp. 191. ISBN 90 272 5083 9 (Europe),\n1 55619 946 5 (US).\nReviewed by Minna Palander-Collin, University of Helsinki\nThe \u00aeeld of historical pragmatics is a relatively new one, but it is clearly growing in\npopularity. Therefore, it is interesting to see what kind of theoretical and methodo-\nlogical approaches will emerge. Leslie K. Arnovick's Diachronic pragmatics is one of\nthe \u00aerst book-length presentations on the topic and provides a particularly intri-\nguing case, as it sets out to explore the relation of pragmatic change and cultural\nprocesses. The relation of linguistic change and social reality is one of the most\nfascinating areas of research in historical pragmatics and a big challenge from the\nmethodological point of view. There are many questions with no simple answers\nthat have also been raised in this book.\nThe purpose of the book is to `show that pragmatic histories can be constructed\nfor several speech acts and speech events in English' (p. 1) and to `suggest the\ncomplicated nature of linguistic changes that realize themselves in pragmatic effect\nand to illustrate the insight into them provided by one application of historical\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS398\npragmatics, namely diachronic pragmatic theory and practice' (pp. 1\u00b12). The author\nwants to `show the complex interactions of different kinds of linguistic change, and\nto show the interconnectedness of formal, semantic, and pragmatic processes over\ntime' (p. 139).\nThe \u00aerst chapter provides a brief methodological introduction in which Arnovick\nemphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of diachronic pragmatics and describes the\nhistory of the discipline mainly relying on Jacobs and Jucker (1995). Arnovick\nclassi\u00aees her approach as a subtype of historical pragmatics, that is diachronic\npragmatics focusing on the linguistic inventory and its communicative use in various\nstages of the same language. Following the distinction made by Jacobs and Jucker\n(1995), diachronic pragmatics may be practised either as a `diachronic form-to-\nfunction mapping' that takes the linguistic form as a starting point, or as a\n`diachronic function-to-form mapping' that takes a speech function as a starting\npoint and looks for its changing linguistic realizations in time. Arnovick points out\nthe lack of studies attempting a diachronic function-to-form mapping and \u00aells in\nthis gap with her work, but she considers the two methodologies essentially\ncomplementary.\nThe diachronic pragmatic theory and practice are illustrated through the case\nstudies dealing with speech acts such as promises, curses, blessings, and greetings\nand speech events such as \u00afyting and sounding. The case studies mostly rely on\nexisting literature that Arnovick reinterprets and reanalyses from the diachronic-\npragmatic perspective. The \u00aerst two case studies in chapters 2 and 3 discuss instances\nof pragmatic change in which events external to the language have an important role\nto play. Chapter 2 exempli\u00aees the cultural nature of speech events, in this case\n\u00afyting and sounding, that live and die with their speakers. Flyting refers to the Old\nEnglish verbal duel, whereas sounding is the verbal contest or game usually played\nby adolescent African-American males. Here and elsewhere it is an essential part of\nArnovick's methodology to analyse carefully the cultural and historical context of\nthe linguistic phenomena she is studying. Finally, the author raises the question\nof the possible universality of what she calls `agonistic orality', so that the\nindependent cultural events of \u00afyting and sounding can eventually be seen as\nmanifestations of the same linguistic universal.\nChapter 3 discusses the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century prescriptivists' treat-\nment of the auxiliaries shall and will. The chapter tells the story of the `Wallis rules'\nthat were \u00aerst formulated by Bishop John Wallis in 1653 and subsequently repeated\nand elaborated in other handbooks. The Wallis rules said that will in the \u00aerst person\nand shall in the second and third persons should be used in order to make a promise,\nwhereas the forms for making a prediction are the opposite: shall in the \u00aerst person\nand will in the third and second persons. Although these rules were arti\u00aecial in the\nsense that they proscribed the normal use of the period, Arnovick argues that the\ngrammarians did not write them arbitrarily, but they tried to maintain the basic\ndistinctions between deontic and epistemic functions of will and shall at the time\nwhen these distinctions were collapsing in real use. Thus, normative regulation by\nR EVI EWS 399\nthe elite may actually constitute a purposeful response to linguistic change in\nprogress, and it should consequently be considered as a factor in a pragmatic\nhistory.\nIn the rest of the case studies the same tendencies keep occurring as factors\nmotivating linguistic change. For instance, Arnovick regards pragmatic strength-\nening as one of the central forces, arguing against the idea of bleaching that has\ntraditionally been associated with the early stages of grammaticalization. Although\nsome elements of the meaning of the items studied are lost during the change, other\ncommunicative and pragmatic functions are strengthened and the speaker perspec-\ntive reinforced. Arnovick echoes Traugott's ideas of subjecti\u00aecation whereby `mean-\nings become increasingly based in the speaker's subjective belief state, or attitude\ntoward what is said' (Traugott, 1989: 35; 1995).\nChapter 4 carries on with will and shall from a different perspective. The focus is\non Present-day North American English in which I will alone does not seem to have\nenough promissory power left, as it is often complemented with various other\nconversational strategies such as I promise. Arnovick maintains that the grammati-\ncalization of these auxiliaries from deontic modals to epistemic tense markers has\nresulted in the use of expanded promises. As will fails to indicate a promissory\nillocutionary force, extra discursive work is needed to clarify the speaker's promis-\nsory intention.\nChapter 5 traces the history of the common curse. Arnovick shows how Old and\nMiddle English declarative curses used for a religious speech act gradually lost their\ndeontic nature and developed an expressive function by which the speaker could\nconvey his or her individual anger. This shift apparently took place during the Late\nMiddle and Early Modern English periods. Arnovick identi\u00aees subjecti\u00aecation as\nthe motivating force, but from the cultural perspective secularization cannot be\nignored either: the institutional role of cursing gradually disappears with the\nweakening of religious authority and the late medieval rise of humanism and the\nbirth of Renaissance ideals. Arnovick suggests that `subjecti\u00aecation and seculariza-\ntion may work hand in hand in the case of English cursing' (p. 93).\nSecularization is also the real-world context for the development of the parting\nutterance discussed in chapter 6. Here Arnovick addresses the development of\nPresent-day English good-bye from the parting blessing God be with you. In line with\nthe history of the common curse, a loss of religious and institutional meaning of\nblessing is detected in the development of the parting utterance. To show how and\nwhen the original blessing force is lost, Arnovick uses evidence from the Chadwyck-\nHealey corpus and dates the shift to the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of\nthe eighteenth century. In addition to secularization, pragmatic strengthening is\nobserved in this change too, as the development of a polite closing formula serves a\nconversational goal. Arnovick introduces the term discursization to cover the\ndevelopment of God be with you into good-bye. According to her, discursization is a\nparticular kind of pragmaticalization. This term, on the other hand, is used by\nAijmer (1997) to refer to the diachronic derivation of pragmatic markers from\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS400\nlexical (propositional) material. Arnovick \u00aends the term pragmaticalization inap-\npropriate in this case, as God be with you has a pragmatic rather than a lexical\nfunction to start with. I was not entirely convinced that the term discursization is\nreally necessary, because in actual practice it may be dif\u00aecult to draw clear lines\nbetween phenomena like pragmaticalization and discursization or even grammatica-\nlization. Namely, diachronic analyses usually focus on a stretch of time with a clear\nbeginning and ending, as if linguistic changes started and ended in a certain year and\nhad a stable before and after the process state. This is hardly the case, as a linguistic\nitem that has gone through one cycle of pragmaticalization\/discursization\/gramma-\nticalization probably continues evolving in one way or another.\nChapter 7 focuses on Bless you, the polite phrase used when somebody sneezes.\nAlthough Bless you seems like a fairly marginal expression, Arnovick identi\u00aees\nsimilar pragmatic and cultural tendencies underlying its development as in the\nprevious case studies; in other words discursization, subjecti\u00aecation, and seculariza-\ntion are among the processes involved. Moreover, the chapter discusses the\nmethodological dif\u00aeculty of analysing a distinctly oral formula like Bless you that\ndoes not really occur in the written corpus material. Still, Arnovick convincingly\nargues for the following continuum of functions associated with Bless you, showing\nhow the expression still carries several functional layers: religious blessing \u00b1 super-\nstitious blessing \u00b1 wish \u00b1 polite formula.\nChapter 8 \u00aenally brings together the major \u00aendings and themes discussed in the\nindividual case studies. The conclusion revisits the linguistic processes motivating\npragmatic change and raises the theoretical and methodological question concerning\nthe nature of the evidence we should require in order to establish connections\nbetween cultural and linguistic processes. The latter half of this chapter focuses on\nthe cultural context of the pragmatic changes studied, considering the in\u00afuence of\nliteracy on the promissory expressions and the impact of secularization on religious\ncurses and parting-greetings.\nThe objections I have to Diachronic pragmatics concern the organization of the\nbook rather than anything else. The interesting insights into diachronic pragmatics\nwould have been easier to appreciate if the argument of the book had more often\nbeen stated explicitly rather than implicitly (cf. p. 139). Particularly so, as the title of\nthe book suggests a major theoretical contribution. The theory and methodology of\ndiachronic pragmatics are admittedly presented in the book, but a more consistent\nand coherent discussion of the overall ideas would have been a bonus. I would have\nalso liked to read more about the treatment of speech acts as compared to previous\napproaches and de\u00aenitions of speech act terminology.\nThe case studies provide convincing reading, as Arnovick manages to show the\nworkings of some major pragmatic processes including subjecti\u00aecation, pragmatic\nstrengthening, and discursization hand in hand with cultural processes like secular-\nization. Moreover, Diachronic pragmatics gives ideas for further research and the\nformulation of pragmatically oriented research questions. It is recommended\nreading for everyone interested in historical pragmatics.\nR EVI EWS 401\nReviewer's address\nDepartment of English\nUniversity of Helsinki\nPB 24 (Unioninkatu 40 B)\nFIN-00014 University of Helsinki\nFinland\nminna.palander-collin@helsinki.\u00ae\nReferences\nAijmer, K.

Tagliamonte, University of Toronto\nIf Krug is right, the English language is in the midst of a far-reaching change. There\nis a brand new class of verbs developing within the auxiliary system. The focal\nstructures of this investigation are have got to, have to and want to, with\nsurface variants as in `I haveta write this paper. I've gotta do it. But I don't wanna.'\nSometime in the early nineteenth century these forms began to increase and have\nrisen exponentially in frequency since that time. Why? This book provides the\ndetailed, well-argued story about this striking development and, in the process, a\nzestful new perspective for research on grammatical change in English which bridges\n`the interface between synchronic and diachronic linguistics' (p. 34). A noteworthy\nfeature of this study is that it mines the rich resources of some of the largest corpora\nof the English language in existence, which are now compiled and available on CD\n(Ho\u00afund, Lendebjerg & Thunestvedt, 1999). They include the British National\nCorpus (BNC), the Helsinki Corpus, the ARCHER corpus (A Representative\nCorpus of Historical English Registers), as well as four 1-million-word corpora of\nwritten English, the Brown corpus and the Lancaster\u00b1Oslo\u00b1Bergen Corpus (LOB),\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS402\nwhich represent American and British English from the 1960s, and their counter-\nparts Frown and FLOB which represent comparable data from the same varieties\nfrom the 1990s. Together, these corpora not only enable Krug to `spot change, but\nalso to determine and compare speeds of change in British and American English'\n(p. 34). Krug argues that in addition to the fact that have got to, have to, want\nto and be going to are fast accelerating, they are also `following rather similar\npaths under our very eyes' (p. 45). Perhaps the most ambitious aspect of this book is\nthe aim to identify and explain these parallels (p. 28). After lengthy analyses of the\nindividual forms as well as a composite analysis in which they, and a number of\nother similar constructions, are compared, Krug is led to the conclusion that these\nforms represent `the rise of a new taxonomical layer: that of emerging modals' (p. 3).\nThe book begins with a preface, a table of contents, lists of \u00aegures, tables, and\nmaps, followed by six chapters and ends with extensive notes, useful appendices\n(I\u00b1VI), a reference list, and detailed index. Of particular interest is the added\ninformation about frequencies, e.g. the 30 most frequent verbs in spontaneous\nspeech in the BNC (\u00aegure 2.1, p. 26), Appendix I which lists the next top 100 verbs\nin spontaneous speech and Appendix V which lists the numbers and percentages of\nforms in the spoken BNC. Such information provides a useful reference for future\nwork on frequency in these constructions.\nChapter 1 introduces the subject matter, the central claims of the book and\norganization of the individual chapters. Indeed, this chapter is a succinct (\u00aeve-page)\nsummary of the whole book.\nChapter 2 sets out the theoretical, empirical and methodological foundations of\nthe work. It also provides an excellent synthetic perspective on research in\ngrammaticalization and links it with contact-induced change and sociolinguistic\ndialectology. An invaluable section is the discussion of the corpora under investiga-\ntion. For anyone who wants to sort out the computerized data available for studying\nEnglish (American or British), I recommend consulting section 2.7.1 which provides\na cogent description and summary of their scope and contents. All told this study is\nbased on millions of words of spoken and written data (\u00aegure 2.2, p. 36), two major\nvarieties and the last 1,000 years in the history of English \u00b1 for this fact alone, an\nimpressive accomplishment. Of course, no corpus-based study would be complete\nwithout methodological cautions (section 2.7.3). Despite the enormous scope of\nthese data, it is important to keep in mind that this work is based on the distinction\nbetween wanna, gonna, and gotta as opposed to want to, going to, and got to.\nHowever, the \u00aendings which come from the 10-million-word spoken BNC are based\non consultation of the computerized transcriptions, not the actual recordings. This\nmeans the data are reliable only in so far as the transcribers of the materials were\nconsistent and faithful in their transcription of these variants. The problem is, even\nwith caveats laid bare, as every researcher who has transcribed corpora will know,\nthat such phonological variability could never have been accurately and consistently\ntranscribed, particularly with a `high number of transcribers and a limited number\nof cross-checks' (p. 38). This must be taken into account in assessing the evidence.\nR EVI EWS 403\nChapter 2 ends with a discussion of modality and auxiliarihood and a review of\nprevious research on the constructions under investigation.\nChapters 3 and 4 contain the empirical analyses of have got to, have to\n(chapter 3) and want to (chapter 4). Each one provides a thorough consideration\nof the diachronic development of these forms, as well as a description of their\nsynchronic characteristics. Each analysis emphasizes frequency effects and proces-\nsing constraints by providing detailed quantitative results on the distribution of full\nand contracted forms from the corpora.\nThe \u00aerst construction under investigation is have to\/have got to. Krug begins\nwith a survey of its evolution, highlighting the fact that the most important factor in\nthe grammaticalization of have to is the tight bondedness between the verb and\nin\u00aenitival to, e.g. hafta\/hasta. An examination of adverb interpolation between have\nand to in the BNC reveals that adverbs do not occur between the verb form and to.\nThis supports the idea that these constructions are tightly bound. He goes on to\ndemonstrate long-term trends from the ARCHER corpus showing that have to\nand have got to increased dramatically in the nineteenth century. This leads to\ntwo main observations: (1) they are recent innovations and (2) they took a dramatic\nstep forward on their grammaticalization paths during the nineteenth century\n(p. 77\u00b18). A shorter-term perspective is provided by a comparison between Brown\/\nFrown, LOB\/FLOB (British vs. American; 1960s vs. 1990s). However, the data show\n\u00aerst that there is no statistically signi\u00aecant change in progress and second, that\nBritish and American \u00aection do not differ with respect to their proportions of have\nto and have got to. The BNC permits a more sociolinguistic perspective since it\nallows for correlations of age, sex, region, etc. First, a study in apparent time shows\nthat there is `a progressive modalization across all age groups' for gotta, i.e. the\nyounger the speaker, the more often they use gotta as opposed to got to (p. 87), but\nhave to has stabilized (p. 88). These results are corroborated by analyses of stylistic\nvariation which show that gotta is used more frequently in spontaneous speech and\nmore often in southern Britain than in the north. In fact, the consistent \u00aending\nacross all corpora in Krug's study show an increase in discourse frequency and\nboundedness of forms. This indicates long-standing grammaticalization of these\nforms. The corroborating trends from the synchronic data show regular effects\naccording to the age of the speakers, the formality of the situation and locations on\nthe vanguard of linguistic change (southern Britain, particularly London). These\nresults suggest that grammaticalization is ongoing. My own recent study of tape-\nrecorded conversations from the 1.2-million-word York English corpus from north-\neast England corroborates some of these \u00aendings (Tagliamonte, 2001). For example,\nfrequencies of have to and have got to remain stable across the current\npopulation of speakers (aged 17\u00b192). However, in York there is no evidence of\nincreasing use of got to or gotta. This may well be due to different rates of\ngrammatical change in different locales in England (see Tagliamonte, to appear), or\nit may also be the result of the different types of data. Either way however, there\nseems to be something more going on with linguistic change in the system of deontic\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS404\nmodality than simply the changing status of gotta that is evident from Krug's data.\nSuch questions remain for future research. Analysis of the variability amongst all\nthe forms used for deontic modality (have to, have got to, got to, and must),\nas well as their distributions, internal linguistic conditioning and external patterns of\nvariability in these or other data, may contribute further evidence. Indeed, Krug's\nstudy highlights the need for an accountable view of regional and social differentia-\ntion in the progress of this linguistic change. For example, map 3.1 (p. 112) provides\na view of the dramatic regional differentiation in England and Northern Ireland\nwith respect to gotta. If this is any indication of differential linguistic change, then\nthis is an excellent opportunity to catch it in action.\nTurning to the analysis of want to\/wanna in chapter 4, Krug notes that want\nto is `currently assuming some semantic and morphosyntactic features that are\ntypical of modal auxiliaries' (p. 117). Beginning with the ARCHER corpus, Krug\nplots the distribution of forms from 1650 to 1990. Like the pattern for have to\/\nhave got to, there is a marked increase in the use of nominal want in the late\nnineteenth century. More recent developments are visible in the Brown\/Frown LOB\/\nFLOB comparison. These show that the rise of the new volitional modal originated\nin Britain, but caught on more rapidly in the US. For example, there is an increase\nof 150 per cent in adjacent want to from 1961 to 1992 in the American English\npress (p. 135). Adverb interpolation counts from the BNC (p. 139) reveal that wanna\nis more resistant than want to to supporting a tighter bonding for this form just as\nwas found for have to\/have got to. Krug also considers social and stylistic\nvariation in the BNC corpus. First, there is a steady decrease in the text frequency of\nwanna with increasing age (p. 161), as well as a correlation between coalescence and\ndecreasing degrees of formality (p. 162). Second, there is a heavy concentration in\nLondon (p. 164). Like the results for gotta there are marked regional differences,\nalthough in this case the patterning seems a little strange \u00b1 why should there be high\nfrequency of wanna in London and the far northeast of England? Krug does not\naddress this in this section, where it seems quite relevant. (Although in another\nsection (p. 190) he makes a few remarks on overall regional distribution.) He\nconcludes this part of the analysis by noting that the `enormous' frequency gains,\nboth long and short term, argue once again for the development of new grammatical\nmeaning.\nTrends towards increasing use of forms that can be construed to be more\n`colloquial' have also been interpreted as the result of a general stylistic shift towards\ninformality in English, i.e. colloquialization (Mair & Hundt, 1997). In contrast,\nKrug argues for a more functional-frequentative explanation, i.e. `that spoken\nEnglish is more receptive to changes than \u00b1 and actually triggers changes in \u00b1 the\nmore rigidly codi\u00aeed written text types' (p. 137). Indeed, one of the stronger points\nKrug makes is that reduced forms like wanna, hafta, gotta actually exhibit different\nsyntactic properties than the unreduced forms like want to, have to, got to. One\nwonders, however, whether such trends actually do have more to do with stylistic\npreference than grammatical reorganization per se. For example, what would\nR EVI EWS 405\nhappen if the rapidly increasing use of wanna in The Guardian (newspaper) between\n1993 and 1996 (\u00aegure 4.6, p. 154) was correlated with the difference between quoted\nspeech as opposed to other types of discourse? In other words, an increasing use of\nwanna in this time period might simply be the result of increasing frequency of direct\nquotes in news stories which would, of course, present renditions of spoken and thus\nmuch less formal language. The same may be true of direct quotes in the other types\nof spoken discourse. Another question is where would any one of these constructions\n\u00aet within its own system, i.e. its own functional domain? In the variationist\nparadigm, for example, these variants would have to be treated along with others\nused for the same function. Further, how can layering in one area of grammar be\ndisentangled from the development of an entirely new function? For example, if\nolder speakers (as well as those in earlier centuries) were not using nominal want to\n(e.g. table 4.10, p. 161) then what did they use for the same semantic value, if\nanything? Krug says it was mostly will (e.g. pp. 151, 242); however, other rival\ncandidates are intend, wish, and desire. None of these seem to be contenders in\nany contemporary age group. Of course, the functional domain of these forms is\nextremely dif\u00aecult to delineate. This highlights how dif\u00aecult it is to operationalize\nthese categories in a quantitative study and how vital to detail the decision-making\nprocess that has gone into extracting and coding the data, in particular in de\u00aening\nthe range of contexts in which the forms actually vary.\nChapter 5 provides a synthesis of the analyses in chapters 3 and 4. At this point,\nan additional group of constructions are considered in the argumentation which are\nnot actually analyzed in the text: going to, need (to), dare (to), and ought\n(to). Krug believes that along with have to\/have got to and want to\/wanna,\nthese constructions also form part of the newly emerging category of neomodals or\nemerging modals. The evidence for this, he argues, is due to: `their recency, for the\ntransformation which they are currently subjected to and for their overall movement\ntowards the central modals' (p. 167). While the recency of have to\/(have) got to,\nwant to and (be) going to is sound (see \u00aegures 5.1\u00b15.6), the modernity of dare\n(to) and ought (to) seems questionable. To me, they seem obsolescent rather than\nnew and vibrant. Krug himself argues for this in an earlier part of the book\n(pp. 4\u00b15). need (to) on the other hand presents a more provocative picture. Is it\nreceding or spreading? While there is some recent evidence that it is expanding in\nwritten English (see Facchinetti, Krug & Palmer, to appear), it bears investigation in\nthe spoken language. In fact, all of these forms would pro\u00aet from further investiga-\ntion in spoken, unre\u00afecting speech, both in standard and nonstandard dialects and\nacross the major varieties of English.\nPerhaps the most far-reaching aspect of this book is the claim for the rise of a new\ntaxonomical layer in English grammar. Much of this part of the book is heavy going\nas Krug proceeds with a lengthy justi\u00aecation of this newly emerging category in the\nlast sections of this chapter (5.6\u00b15.8). He provides very detailed justi\u00aecation for\npositing `functional and conceptual closeness' (p. 212) amongst the constructions.\nIncluded in his lines of evidence are various principles and theories: gravitational\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS406\ntheory, prototype theory, and various principles from the grammaticalization\nliterature. When he attempts to operationalize the gravitational model by simulating\nthe gravitation of the category (sections 5.75\u00b15.8.4, and illustrated in Appendix VI)\nthings get quite complicated. The main point here is that the constructions under\ninvestigation have a `prototypical internal structure'. In other words, they are\nsimilar across a number of critical linguistic criteria: verbal complementation, do\nsupport, syllabic structure, and phonemic contrast (p. 233). Those forms that are\nfrequent and which share syntactic, morphological and phonological attributes are\nranked as more prototypical of the category of emerging modals. In this schema,\ngoing to and got to are the most prototypical members of the class, closely followed\nby want to and have to (p. 236). However, it is important to keep in mind that this\ndomain is loose, not tight, and new members are both conceivable and expected.\nKrug suggests that promising new modals are try to (tryta or tryna) and wish to\n(wishta). Given the gravitational pull of this emergent category, we might expect\nmore, and if so, we should be on the lookout.\nChapter 6 offers a summation. Krug concludes that the results of the study\npresent ample evidence for `the primary hypothesis of functionalist or usage-based\nlinguistics'. A further `fully con\u00aermed' general result is that `grammatical change\nspreads gradually and takes centuries', but proceeds in stages of rapid development\n(pp. 249\u00b150). All this is a welcome addition to research on grammaticalization in\nEnglish, particularly when so rigorously grounded in extremely large and representa-\ntive corpora. Yet, it seems strange that with all the embedding of this research in the\n\u00aeelds of gravitation theory, grammaticalization theory, etc. Krug does not go to\ngreater length to situate these \u00aendings with other prevailing hypotheses about\ngrammatical change, in particular the constant rate hypothesis (Kroch, 1989). This\nhypothesis, now known as the Constant Rate Effect (due to converging support\nfrom numerous case studies, Kroch, 2001: 720), holds that `when one grammatical\noption replaces another with which it is in competition across a set of linguistic\ncontexts, the rate of replacement, properly measured, is the same in all of them'\n(Kroch, 1989: 200). The new class of emerging modals studied here, with their\ndramatic S-curves of change, present an ideal case for testing this hypothesis. Here,\nhowever, Krug focuses on the pervasive in\u00afuence of text frequency, which he argues\nenables the linguist to actually diagnose grammaticalization. When charted diachro-\nnically, frequency pinpoints important stages within the pathway of an individual\nchange; when plotted in apparent time, it facilitates charting the diffusion and\nspread of an emergent form. Further, Krug argues that text frequency is a\nfundamental parameter in the genesis of the new category as well as discerning the\nmotivation behind its development. Krug also suggests a number of other possible\nmotivations for the spread of these forms such as information processing and \u00aelling\ngaps in the defective paradigm of must and will. However, one wonders what\nmultiplex of internal (grammatical) contexts might underlie the dramatic leaps in\nfrequency for have to and want to and whether and how external (social)\nconstraints might also be involved. Such information would undoubtedly provide\nR EVI EWS 407\nfurther explanations for their contemporary distribution. Now, with Krug's results\nat one's \u00aenger tips, further research can be spear-headed grounded in his rich\n\u00aendings.\nReviewer's address:\nDepartment of Linguistics\nUniversity of Toronto\n130 St George Street, Room 6076\nToronto, Ontario M5S 3H1\nCanada\nsali.tagliamonte@utoronto.ca\nReferences\nFacchinetti, R., M.

Paperback \u00a317.99, ISBN 0 340 70608 2.\nPublished in the USA by Oxford University Press, New York.\nReviewed by Patrick Honeybone, Edge Hill College of Higher Education\nOne of the sadly few aspects of linguistics that the media have an interest in (in the\nUK, at least) is the study of accents. While they might not know or care what the\ndifference is between `accent' and `dialect', journalists know that their audiences\nhave a real interest in many of the issues connected with the social and regional\nvarieties of English. As editors Foulkes and Docherty (henceforth F&D) mention in\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS408\ntheir introductory initial chapter to this welcome and important book,1 many\narticles have recently appeared in the British press on the putative role that television\nsoap operas play in causing the spread of certain accent features, such as glottalling\n(t ! ?), fricative fronting (T, D ! f, v), and high rising intonation. As F&D\ncomment further, there has been little academic research on this question, and,\ndespite the strongly sociolinguistic \u00afavour of several of the chapters in Urban voices\n(henceforth UV), there is little comment on that issue here.\nA substantial amount of research has been carried out on the accents of English\nspoken in the British Isles, however. What sets UV apart from these previous\npublications is neatly summarized in F&D's two immediate aims in producing the\nvolume: `(i) to provide a collection of recent research based on empirical studies on\naccent variation; and (ii) to collect together descriptive data yielded by such studies\nto stand as a reference resource' (p. 1). Much of the recent work on accents of\nEnglish is scattered in journal articles and PhD theses, and F&D are to be\ncongratulated on bringing this work together in one volume. There are, naturally,\n\u00afaws in the book, but many of these are unavoidable in an edited volume. There is\nsome considerable variation in the individual chapters in terms of aims and\nachievements. The disparity in the chapters' aims, at least, is partly intentional,\nhowever, and is of potentially paradigm-creating importance.\nAs well as initial and \u00aenal matter, the volume consists of \u00aefteen chapters. In the\n\u00aerst of these, `Urban voices \u00b1 overview', UV's editors set the subsequent chapters in\ncontext and make explicit the links between them. They also do much more than\nthis. F&D run through a range of the key issues that are connected with any\nlinguistic research on pronunciation and discuss the main important topics in the\nstudy of the development of accents and the relationships that can exist between\naccents of one language, all in a remarkably short space. As F&D explain, previous\nand ongoing work on accents in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, as elsewhere,\nhas been carried out in several distinct frameworks. Researchers who would\ncharacterize themselves as phonologists, phoneticians, dialectologists, and socio-\nlinguists2 have all conducted work on these varieties, often to investigate a particular\ntheoretical debate in their own discipline. Work in all these \u00aeelds is featured in the\nchapters of UV. All too often, researchers from different disciplines do not speak to\neach other, although it is clear that such communication could be advantageous for\nall. F&D propose that work from all these disciplines, when it takes accents of a\nparticular language as its empirical base, should also be seen as part of a broad\ndiscipline which they name `accent studies'. It is profoundly to be hoped that this\ncompromise discipline takes off, so that, while phonologists, for example, will still\nspeak to phonologists about the debates which are relevant in their discipline, and\nsociolinguists will speak to sociolinguists, each might also speak to the other, and\n1 Thanks are due to Paul Foulkes for bringing Kallen (2001) to my attention, for other helpful comments\nand for telling me to be as brutal as I needed to be in this review. Luckily, there's little to be brutal\nabout.\n2 We might also add historical phonologists to the list.\nR EVI EWS 409\nthe description of `accent variation can be seen as a pursuit in its own right, rather\nthan being an issue towards the periphery of numerous separate academic traditions'\n(p. 6).3 Such description is indeed a valid aim in its own right, and will, needless to\nsay, connect with the media interest in the topic mentioned at the beginning of this\nreview.\nThe dual aims of UV shape most of the remaining fourteen chapters of the\nvolume. Apart from two, each of these presents (i) `descriptive material' for one or\nmore accents of English which involves, in varying degrees of detail, phonetic and\nphonological description of the accents, and (ii) a discussion of an issue of\ntheoretical or methodological importance for (at least) one of the disciplines which\nF&D include in accent studies, using accent material from the chapter as its\nempirical base. The details of these chapters are:\n. Chapter 2: `Patterns of variation and change in three Newcastle vowels: is\nthis dialect levelling?' by Dominic Watt & Lesley Milroy\n.

Chapter 14: `(London)Derry: between Ulster and local speech \u00b1 class,\nethnicity and language change' by Kevin McCafferty\n. Chapter 15: `Dublin English: current changes and their motivation' by\nRaymond Hickey\n3 A perhaps discouraging sign in this regard is the review of UV in Kallen (2001), where the notion of\naccent studies, as presented in the volume, is criticized for its lack of coherence. This is particularly\ndiscouraging as the key criticism of UV in that review seems to be that not all of the chapters are purely\nexamples of sociolinguistics.\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS410\nThe accents discussed in the individual chapters are largely clear from the chapter\ntitles, apart from the fact that Docherty & Foulkes's chapter 3 only presents\ndescriptive material for Derby (because Watt & Milroy's chapter 2 presents material\nfor Newcastle). The other slight anomalies are that Chirrey's chapter 12 only\npresents descriptive material, which is compensated for by Scobbie, Hewlett &\nTurk's chapter 13, which presents no descriptive material, but discusses important\nphonetic and phonological issues connected with data from chapters 11 and 12.\nSeveral things will be clear from the list of contents: (i) F&D have succeeded in\nbringing together many of the best-known and respected \u00aegures in their \u00aeelds to\ndescribe accents that they have worked on for years, and (ii) the accents covered in\nUV represent a fairly diverse and broadly based selection from a good range of\nEnglish regions and with an example or two from Scotland, Wales, Northern\nIreland, and the Republic of Ireland, but (iii) not all of the accents covered are\nstrictly speaking urban \u00b1 for example, West Wirral, which the author describes as\n`mixed rural\/suburban' (p. 90), and (iv) the accents of many key urban areas in the\nBritish Isles are not discussed \u00b1 for example, Manchester, Leeds, Aberdeen, Dundee,\nBelfast, Cork, any accent of south-west England and north Wales, and Liverpool\n(although this is touched on in chapter 5). It would be dif\u00aecult for one book to cover\nall accents, even all urban accents, and several of these lacunae are due to the fact\nthat little or no research has been done on the varieties in question. A second\nvolume would certainly be welcome, to rectify some of these omissions.\nThe volume's dual aims have further implications. On the positive side, they open\nup the prospect that it will appeal to more than one audience; on the negative side,\nthey mean that the book could run the danger of trying to do too much, while failing\nto achieve either aim in enough detail. Luckily, most of the chapters avoid the\npossible negative implications and succeed in ful\u00aelling their positive promise. It is\nlikely that the descriptive aspect of the book will be of most use in teaching, while\nthe discursive, theoretical aspect will be of most interest to academic researchers.\nThis double appeal is a clever trick to pull off in a single volume.4 However, while\nthe constraints that are put on the space available by this requirement to do two\nthings at once do, in fact, mean that sometimes both sides suffer and the reader is\nleft with the wish that the description could have been more detailed and the\ntheoretical discussion more in depth, the overall impression is that the volume is a\nsuccess. UV has already established itself on the reading lists of academic courses\ndealing with the accents of English, as a web search for `Urban Voices' and `reading'\nshows, and some of the theoretical discussions have important and novel implica-\ntions for the disciplines that they connect with.\nThe descriptive material varies from around four pages (e.g. McCafferty on\n4 UV is described as a `textbook' in the blurb on its back cover, but this seems mistaken. It certainly could\n(and probably should) be prescribed for courses on accent variation in British and Irish English, and\nseveral of the theoretical discussions could usefully be set as readings on courses in phonetics,\nsociolinguistics, or historical phonology for example, but UV is more than just a textbook. Several of\nthe theoretical discussions are important contributions to debate in their disciplines.\nR EVI EWS 411\n(London)Derry and Hickey on Dublin) to eleven pages (Tollfree on South East\nLondon). All descriptions make use of the notion of `keywords', introduced by\nWells (1982), as a means to describe, discuss, and compare the types of vocalic\ncontrasts and realizations that exist in accents of English without having to\narti\u00aecially choose the phonemes of one accent as a basis for comparison and to\navoid the imputation of a pandialectal phonological system. Thus, for example,\ngoat stands for a set of words which all feature the same vowel (or set of vowel\nvariants): in Northern English varieties this is most often a long monophthong\n(Stoddart, Upton & Widdowson show this to be most commonly [O:] in Shef\u00aeeld,\nand Watt & Milroy describe [o:] as the most common realization in Newcastle) and\nSouthern English normally has a diphthong (Tollfree describes [\u00c3U] as a common\nvariant in South East London). Chapters extend the core set of keywords to allow\nthe description of the phonological contrasts and segmental realizations in the\nvariety in question.\nThe `small capital' notation is also extended to the discussion of consonantal\nphenomena, thus the various realizations of \/t\/ are discussed under the heading t,\nand conventions such as stops and h-dropping are used. These are pragmatically\nuseful conventions, but authors also use phonological conventions such as \/t\/ and\nsociolinguistic ones such as (t) (and even (t)) in their discussion, to differing degrees.\nThe aim of description and the use of keywords invites comparison with Wells's\n(1982) Accents of English, particularly volume 2, The British Isles. While sections of\nthis book are probably the closest thing available to the descriptive portions of the\nUV chapters, the two books are quite different. The chapters of UV often provide\ndetail not available in Wells (1982), but UV makes no claim at completeness of\ncoverage and, as explained above, it contains substantial theoretical discussion of\nissues not addressed in Wells's books. The detail provided in many of the chapters of\nUV also sets it apart from the few other descriptive works on British accents, such as\nHughes & Trudgill (1996).\nThe theoretical plurality, the range of accents covered, and constraints of space\nmake it impossible to engage here with all the material in the book, but some\ncomments are in order.\nIn terms of the descriptive material, several chapters are very detailed, for\nexample, that by Chirrey on Edinburgh English. However, the discussion of\nsegmental phonetics and phonology is in general far more detailed than the\ndiscussion of suprasegmental matters. Not only is intonation only very brie\u00afy\ndiscussed, if at all,5 very little reference is made to syllabic or other prosodic\nstructure. While this may be the result of a conscious decision to save space, it can\nlead to descriptive inadequacies; for example, Newbrook's treatment of k in Liver-\npool English as it is re\u00afected in West Wirral English refers to `[a]ffricate\/fricative\/\n5 Remarkably, Newbrook makes no mention of intonation at all, despite the fact that one of the main\nvarieties that he deals with, Liverpool English, is well recognized as having distinctive intonational\npatterns which have been described in unusual detail in Knowles (1974). Mees & Collins's chapter on\nCardiff English is an exception to the pattern here, as it deals with intonation in some detail.\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS412\nheavily aspirated Liverpool \/k\/ (more usually fricative [x])' (p. 97), ignoring the fact\nthat these realizations are conditioned by syllabic, other prosodic, and melodic\nconstraints (see, for example, Honeybone, 2001). The description of the vocalic\nvariants found in the varieties discussed is often very detailed (especially in Williams\n& Kerswill's and Tollfree's chapters) but this does somewhat serve to intrigue the\nreader as to which factors precisely govern the variation. There is little doubt,\nhowever, that the descriptive sections of the chapters will be of real use to those with\nan interest in the varieties concerned, or in accent studies generally.\nAs regards the theoretical and methodological discussions, different chapters will\ndoubtless appeal to different readers because of the differing traditions that they\nconnect with as the authors are allowed to grind their own theoretical axes.\nSeveral of the authors explore aspects of their data from a broadly Labovian\nsociolinguistic perspective. Thus McCafferty investigates his (London)Derry data in\nterms of what it shows about, or how it is affected by, class and ethnic identity.\nMees & Collins show how females are leading a change in Cardiff English which\ninvolves the adoption of glottalling and glottalization of t among ambitious\nworking-class females in an attempt to sound as if they are speaking English\nEnglish, and Mathisen \u00aends that women are leading change in her Birmingham data\nas well, involving a move towards a clearly non-RP local variant. Also, Newbrook\ndiscusses self-perception of the use of an accent which arguably has low prestige.\nWatt & Milroy's chapter is also sociolinguistic in nature. The chapter makes an\nimportant contribution to the study of `dialect levelling' and argues against chain\nshift analyses of changes such as the one involving the face, goat, and nurse\nvowels that they discuss in Newcastle English. They argue that this change involves\na move not towards an institutionally imposed standard, such as RP, but towards a\ngeneralized identi\u00aeably Northern lect, brought about by loosening network ties.\nWilliams & Kerswill also discuss the evidence for dialect levelling towards a\nhypothesized national `non-standard' youth norm, which they show to be progres-\nsing at different rates in Milton Keynes, Reading, and Hull due to the different\nstrengths of network ties among the speakers of the varieties, which is caused by\ndiffering rates of economic prosperity and in-migration. Stuart-Smith's chapter is an\nimportant contribution to the description of Voice Quality in Glasgow English and\nits sociolinguistic patterning. It is an impressive addition to the few existing pieces of\nsuch work.\nThe discussion in Stoddart, Upton & Widdowson's chapter is primarily dialecto-\nlogical, although it aims to connect with sociolinguists. The authors engage in a\nuseful discussion addressing the question of how samples of `local' speech can best\nbe obtained by linguists, and defend the use of non-mobile older rural males\n(NORMs), or at least the basic principle behind the use of such informants,\nspeci\u00aecally in the collection of data for the Survey of English Dialects.\nTwo chapters focus on issues which are most closely identi\u00aeable as part of\nhistorical phonology. Hickey's discussion of a chain shift in his Dublin data is\nnotable as he argues that it involves one single key change which is subject to both\nR EVI EWS 413\nneogrammarian exceptionlessness and lexical diffusion among different groups of\nspeakers. Two groups of speakers which differ in terms of their social motivation are\nclaimed to differ in the implementation of the change such that in one `motivated'\ngroup (who want to be associated with the change), it proceeds in a neogrammarian\nfashion, and in another group of `detached participants', the change is slowly\nworking through the lexicon. Trudgill's chapter on Norwich English also contains\nimportant contributions to debate in historical phonology, as he argues that, while\nsome of the features of the accent can be accounted for by exogenous factors, such\nas contact with other communities, others must be the result of endogenous change,\ncontra Milroy (1992).\nDocherty & Foulkes's chapter, which compares Derby with Newcastle English,\ncombines some aspects of sociolinguistics with the tools of instrumental phonetics\nand seeks to draw some conclusions for phonological theory. They show convin-\ncingly that the use of spectrograms can reveal new and fascinating sociolinguistically\nstructured patterns of consonantal realization which have gone unnoticed in\nstandard sociolinguistic methodology, which uses only auditory analysis. They\nconclude that these results are dif\u00aecult to reconcile with certain models of phonology\nand with models of phonological change which allow for phonologically driven or\n`system-based' innovation, but these conclusions do not seem to me necessarily to\nfollow. In line with the comments above, hinting at co-operation and compatibility\namong different academic disciplines in accent studies, it seems to me that both\nphonological and sociophonetic theory are needed in order to fully understand\naccent variation.\nScobbie, Hewlett & Turk also show how instrumental phonetics can interact with\nphonological theory by reinterpreting acoustic studies of varieties of Scottish\nEnglish to show that certain previous descriptions of the Scottish Vowel Length\nRule (SVLR) seem to have misrepresented the set of input vowels. They show how\ntheir important results imply that only the vowels \/i, u, ai\/ are involved in the length\nalternations involved in the SVLR environments, and that previous descriptions of\nthe process, which have included at least \/e, O, o, au\/, may be mistaken. As the\nauthors conclude themselves, further research on the issue is needed, but it need not\nbe that only instrumental research is considered. Native-speaker intuition data can\nbe important in the description of phonological systems, as Trudgill shows in his\nchapter in this volume. One important upshot of their results is that they con\u00aerm\nthat the complex phonological SVLR process exists, with its intriguing set of\ntriggering phonological environments.\nTollfree also attempts to use the results of her study of accent variation in South\nLondon to engage with models of theoretical phonology, but the attempt is not\nconvincing. Her description of the variety in question is detailed and impressive, but,\nperhaps due to lack of space, her discussion of Government Phonology in particular\nis garbled and does not succeed in showing that the model is incompatible with her\ndata because her argumentation cannot be followed. In discussing l-velarization,\nshe uses a segmental representation for \/l\/ which, oddly, features an underlying\nENGLISH LANGUAGE A ND LINGUISTICS414\nlabiality element, unlike any Government Phonologist, and claims that the process\nmust be analysed as a case of lenition, which would not be the description of the\nprocess as she presents it. In the end she stipulates that the `clear\/dark \/l\/ alternation\nis phonetic' and does not recognize that a model of phonology can allow for gradient\nphonetic implementation.\nUV concludes with a one-page appendix, references, and indices. The appendix\nties in with a collection of recordings of twenty-four speakers which is available on\ncassette and CD to accompany UV. A short passage of unscripted speech is followed\nby the reading of a word list. While in principle it is clearly a good idea to make\nrecordings available with such a book, the material included on the UV tape and CD\nis rather disappointing as it is not integrated with the main chapters of the book and\nnot all of the recordings are of good quality.\nThe references and indices, by contrast, are very well done. F&D have done an\nexcellent job in making them user-friendly. The references are gathered together at\nthe end of the book but each title is annotated to indicate which chapters refer to it.\nThis is a useful tool for backwards reference. The indices are also sizeable and\nuseful.\nAs noted above, UV has its \u00afaws. Any attempt to collate so much information\nand to spur on theoretical debate with contributions from a range of disparate\nauthors could not avoid having some. The book's positive points easily outweigh\nany shortcomings however, and a volume such as this is welcome and important.\nWork in `accent studies' is continuing on several varieties of English (see, for\nexample, Watson, 2002, Watt, 2002) and is also being carried out on accents of other\nlanguages (see, for example, Durand, 2002 for French and van Oostendorp, 2001 for\nDutch). Only time will tell if the term `accent studies' embeds itself into academic\ndiscourse to describe work of the sort contained in this book. Whether it does or\nnot, it is to be hoped that UV serves as a stimulus for further work of this type.\nReviewer's address:\nDepartment of English Language and Literature\nEdge Hill College of Higher Education\nOrmskirk, Lancashire L39 4QP\nhoneybop@edgehill.ac.uk\nReferences\nDurand, J.
