In this letter, we propose an alternative mechanism for electron emission from highly\ncompressive thin films based on stress-induced \u2018\u2018band structure\u2019\u2019 modification of nano-ordered sp2\nregions in the thin films. Experimental results are recorded which show that the localized\ncompressive stress governs electron emission in the amorphous carbon thin films studied here rather\nthan the surface nanostructures\/features or the diamond-like sp3 hybridized bond component. This\nanalysis is in agreement with the concept of an internal or nongeometric field enhancement from sp2\nnanostructures giving rise to high dielectric inhomogeneity within the carbon thin film. The results\npresented could be extended to explain the anomalous field emission behavior of carbon nanotubes.\n\u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics. @DOI: 10.1063\/1.1497442#Amorphous carbon (a-C) has attracted much attention\ndue to its ability to emit electrons at a relatively low applied\nelectric fields ~,40 V\/mm!. Comparing this threshold field\nwith conventional flat metal cathodes, electric fields in ex-\ncess of many hundreds of volts\/micron would be required for\nemission to be initiated. Thus, there is a need for sharp ~na-\nnometer scale! cone shaped metal \u2018\u2018Spindt\u2019\u2019 tips1 in order to\ngive field crowding and with it electron field emission.\nSpindt tips, although in use to produce small area displays,\nare difficult to be produced over very large areas and is an\nexpensive technology to pursue. The capacity for materials\nsuch as a-C to emit at low fields allows for them to be\ndeveloped as cold cathodes, which can be used for flat panel\ndisplays, among other research areas that are technologically\nimportant.2 Amorphous carbon\u2019s unique properties such as\nchemical inertness, stable mechanical properties, and ease of\ndeposition makes it even more appealing as a candidate for\ndisplay activities. Various carbon based materials such as\namorphous carbon (a-C),3 diamond-like carbon,4 diamond,5\ncarbon nanotubes,6 and carbon containing polymers7 have\nbeen intensively studied in recent years. However, the pre-\ncise mechanism responsible for the excellent electron emis-\nsion of these materials has not yet been fully understood and\nis presently a subject of intense investigation. Early reports\npostulated that the emission threshold field (E th) is con-\ntrolled by the diamond-like sp3 content based on a negative\nelectron affinity argument.8 However, more recent studies9,10\nhave demonstrated that the distribution of the sp2 C sites can\nbe a dominant factor which results in the creation of high\na!Electronic mail: c.poa@eim.surrey.ac.uk\nb!Permanent address: Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Unicamp, Insti-\ntuo de Fisica \u2018\u2018Gleb Wataghin\u2019\u2019-13083-970, Campinas-SP, Brazil.8530003-6951\/2002\/81(5)\/853\/3\/$19.00\nloaded 13 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP linternal field enhancement within the a-C nanostructure. In a\nrecent letter, Carey et al.9 explained the field enhancement of\na-C:H films in terms of the dielectric inhomogeneities be-\ntween the sp2 and sp3 phases. The origin of the field en-\nhancement was explained on the basis of the proximity of the\nconductive sp2 clusters within the film giving rise to electro-\nmagnetic field perturbations on a nanometer scale. On the\nother hand, it is also well known that amorphous carbon\nfilms have the unique property of possessing high amounts of\nintrinsic stress ~or internal pressure!. In fact, intrinsic stress\nvalues ~;12 GPa! of almost one order of magnitude higher\nthan those found in other amorphous materials ~,1 GPa!\nsuch as a-Si, a-Ge, or metals have been reported. However,\nalthough it is known from theoretical studies in the literature\nthat by applying pressure to a material one can modify its\nelectronics properties, e.g., band structure, resistivity, Fermi\nlevel,11,12 so far, the influence of the internal matrix pressure\n~or intrinsic stress! on the electron emission properties of any\nthin film has not been examined. By carefully controlling\ndeposition conditions, the properties of highly sp2 rich amor-\nphous carbon thin films which have very different internal\npressures ~or stresses! ~from 1 to about 12 GPa! are pre-\nsented in this letter. Due to the graphitic sp2 nanoclusters\nbeing subject to asymmetric high internal pressure we pro-\npose a change in the film band structure, giving rise to the\nproposed new physical phenomenon of \u2018\u2018squeezing\u2019\u2019 out of\nelectrons from thin films.\nThe a-C films were deposited by an ion beam assisted\ndeposition technique using two Kauffman ion sources. Neon,\nargon, and krypton gases were introduced in both Kauffman\nsources, one for the sputtering of a graphite target and the\nother for the simultaneous assisting ~ion bombardment! of\nthe growing film.

Stress measurements were\nperformed using films deposited on c-Si bars, applying an\noptical bending beam method.13 Two laser beams were\nscanned across the substrate surface to obtain the curvatures\nof the substrate plus film. The intrinsic stress of the thin film\nwas then calculated using the Stoney equation.14 The field\nemission ~FE! characteristics of these films were determined\nusing a sphere-to-plane technique. The threshold field (E th)\nis defined as the macroscopic electric field where an emis-\nsion current of 1 nA is observed.\nThe structural analysis of the a-C films from x-ray pho-\ntoelectron spectroscopy ~XPS!, film density ~from Ruther-\nford backscattering!, and Raman scattering indicate that the\nmaterial consists of a highly compressed and dense sp2 net-\nwork. The UV photoelectron spectroscopy ~UPS! ~top of the\nvalence band! and band gap measurements concur with the\nview of an absence of a band gap in all the films.13 These\ncharacteristics are in agreement with the high values of sp2\nbonds ~;90%! obtained from EELS, for all the samples. In\nspite of the highly graphitic nature of the films, there has\nbeen an intrinsic correlation between the plasmon energy\n~from the XPS C 1s plasmon peak! and the resistivity with\nthe intrinsic stress ~see Fig. 1!. We believe the increase of the\ninternal pressure ~high compressive stress! within the\ngraphitic-like a-C matrix has led to the increase in the XPS\nplasmon energy, and a huge decrease of the resistivity. The\nplasmons, from XPS, can be used as a probe of local valence\nelectronic density of the film.15,16 The high values of plas-\nmon energies ~;29.5 eV! obtained from XPS are compa-\nrable to those values found for highly tetrahedral amorphous\ncarbon (ta-C) films,17 and not expected in amorphous thin\nfilm with a high degree of sp2 bonding. It is also noted that\nthe resistivity, Rs , of 2 mV cm is comparable to the sheet\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject to AIP lresistance observed in the c-axis orientation of crystalline\ngraphite. In addition, the decrease in the resistivity is in\nagreement with hydrostatic experiments on a-C films18\nwhere it has been shown that an increase in pressure reduces\nthe resistivity. To understand a highly sp2 rich a-C film with\na high stress and local electronic density, one has to picture a\nmicrostructure that compresses the core\/valence electrons\nand atoms closer together. When the increase in the local\ndensity with the internal stress of our films are compared\nwith the internal stress of our films with the decrease of the\ninterplanar distance of microcrystalline graphite, an inter-\nplane sp2 cluster distance reduction of about 15% was ob-\nserved by Lynch et al.19 over the same range of pressure.13\nThese results are also in agreement with the recent work of\nUmemoto et al.20 who proposed a new dense, metallic, and\nrigid form of graphitic carbon with characteristics very simi-\nlar to the films reported here. The effect of increasing inter-\nnal pressure can also be quite important on the band\nstructure\/density of states of the graphitic sp2 films. By hav-\ning the sp2 clusters more close together, the energy gap be-\ntween p and p* bands can decrease or in some cases over-\nlap. The increasing overlap of the p and p* bands can be the\nmain reason for the increasing electron conductivity with\npressure. The increasing interaction between the valence\nelectrons is reflected on the high values of electronic density\n~XPS plasmon energy! shown in Fig. 1~a!. The sp2 clusters\n\u2018\u2018c-axis\u2019\u2019 spacing is likely to be smaller than that of crystal-\nline graphite and more akin to a 3D graphite network. These\nclusters would be randomly oriented, with the highly local-\nized strain possibly altering its \u2018\u2018band structure,\u2019\u2019 giving rise\nto a new physical phenomenon that can have beneficial ef-\nfects on the electron emission process.\nThe analysis proposed above is further supported by\nSTM and TEM studies. As observed in Fig. 2, there is clear\nevidence of noncrystalline structures on the surface and in\nthe bulk of the film. The STM images show the presence of\nhighly conductive graphitic nanostructures surrounded by a\nless conductive region. We attribute this difference to the\npresence of ordered graphitic nanoparticles embedded in an\namorphous carbon matrix. Figure 2~b! shows the nanopar-\nticle fringes with interlayer spacing of 3.2 \u00c5 ~002! similar to\nthose found in graphite. It is important to observe that, the\nreduction of the distance between the planes, as proposed\nabove, is only to be expected when the film is under high\ninternal pressure. Therefore, as the films are \u2018\u2018peeled off\u2019\u2019\nfrom the substrate for the TEM analysis, some relaxation of\nFIG. 2. ~a!

A remarkable\nsimilarity or resemblance between the stress and the thresh-\nold field can be observed. Independent of the noble gas used,\nit is interesting to note that the lowest values of threshold\nfield match the highest stress values in the samples. This\nprovides a clear correlation between the increasing of the\ninternal pressure and the electron emission process. The low\nthreshold FE may be explained by examining the influence\nof the intrinsic stress on the large and densely populated sp2\nclusters. It is possible that the stress will induce nongeomet-\nric field enhancement within the films by placing the clusters\ncloser together. Recently, Carey et al.9 suggested that the\nfield enhancement in a-C could be attributed to differences\nin the dielectric and conductive properties of sp2 clusters\nsurrounded by more insulating sp3 matrix. The dielectric\nmismatch between these two phases can have a significant\nfield enhancement if the conductive sp2 clusters are closely\nspaced. The evidence appears to support a field enhancement\nprocess based on proximity effects of conductive sp2 clus-\nters giving rise to electromagnetic modification of field lines\nin a highly localized region. It may be postulated that the\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject to AIP lemission mechanism could be a result of a combination of\ntwo effects: ~1! the stress, which induces band structure\nmodifications in the films; ~2! the local density changes ~also\na consequence of the internal pressure! which is responsible\nfor the internal field enhancement influencing the absolute\nvalue of the threshold field. This work indicates that by the\ncareful control of the stress in nanostructured materials cus-\ntom designed cathodes can be manufactured and the research\nopens the doors to a whole new class of cold cathode devices\nthat can be used in the future. Interestingly, recent first prin-\nciple pseudopotential calculations21 show similar density of\nstate modifications to the electronic properties of carbon\nnanotubes which may explain previously anomalous results\nwhen analyzing electron emission using purely a Fowler\u2013\nNordheim approach.\nThis work was partially sponsored by CNPq, FAPESP.\nThe authors acknowledge Dr. V.
