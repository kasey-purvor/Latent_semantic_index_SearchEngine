Stocker, N.Y. Zaalov, E.M. Warrington, and D.R. Siddle \nDepartment of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK \nemw@le.ac.uk \nAbstract \nObservations of the direction of arrival and time of flight of HF signals propagating on a \n1400 km path oriented along the mid-latitude trough are presented. At night, the signal \ncommonly arrives from directions offset from the great circle bearing by up to 80\u00b0 and \nthese events have been categorised into five main types. Statistics indicating how often \nthese categories of propagation were observed in the period August 2006 to September \n2007 are presented. The physical mechanisms which result in the off great circle \npropagation are also discussed. \n \n1 Introduction \nThe mid-latitude trough is a region of depleted electron density in the nighttime F-\nregion ionosphere in which the critical frequencies drop by a factor of at least two and \nthe altitude of the electron density peak rises by 100 km or more (Moffett and Quegan, \n1983). During the winter and equinoctial months, the trough takes the form of a band a \nfew degrees wide in latitude to the equatorward side of the auroral oval, stretching in \nlocal time from dusk to dawn. In summer, \nthe trough is much less pronounced and is \nconfined to the hours around midnight. \nThe location of the trough also depends on \ngeomagnetic activity with the region of \nelectron density depletion moving \nequatorwards and the evening sector \ntending to move to earlier local times as \nactivity increases.  \nFor terrestrial HF radio systems, the \nelectron density depletion in the trough \nregion reduces the maximum frequency \nthat can be reflected by the ionosphere \nalong the great circle path (GCP). For long \npaths, the signal is often received via a \nground \/ sea-scatter mechanism to the side \nof the GCP (Stocker et al., 2003). For \nshorter paths, gradients in electron density \nassociated with the trough walls and \nembedded ionospheric irregularities often \nresult in propagation in which the signal \npath is well displaced from the great circle \ndirection, with directions of arrival at the \nreceiver offset by up to 100\u00b0 (Rogers et \nal., 1997).

The four lines indicate the \nouter and inner edges of the north and south \nwalls. \ndirection impact not only on radiolocation systems for which estimates of a transmitter \nlocation are obtained by triangulation from a number of receiving sites, but also on any \nradio communications system in which directional antennas are employed. Furthermore, \nthe Doppler and multi-mode delay spread characteristics of the signal are also affected \nwhen propagation is via scatter \/ reflection from irregularities in or close to the north \nwall of the trough (Warrington et al., 1997; Warrington and Stocker, 2003). \n2 Observations \nRecently, measurements have been made of the direction of arrival (DOA) and the time \nof flight (TOF) of HF signals received over two paths oriented along the trough between \nUppsala, Sweden (since August 2006) and Helsinki, Finland (since December 2006) \nand the University of Leicester\u2019s field site near to Leicester (see Figure 1). In this paper, \nonly observations from the Uppsala\u2013Leicester path will be presented since these can be \ncompared to similar measurements taken on this path close to solar maximum (the \ncurrent interval is close to the solar minimum) and for reasons of brevity. Six \nfrequencies were employed, namely 4.6, 7.0, 8.0, 10.4, 11.1, and 14.4 MHz. Each \ntransmission comprised a 13-bit Barker-coded BPSK sequence synchronised to GPS so \nthat the direction of arrival and signal strength could be measured as a function of \nabsolute time of flight. A measurement for a given transmitter and frequency was taken \nevery two minutes. Examination of the 14 months of observations currently available \nhas enabled five types of off great circle propagation events to be identified. Each type \nis described below with example observations presented in Figures 2 to 6. The signal \nreflection points for the same observations given in Figures 2 to 6 are presented in \nFigure 7. The reflection points have been derived using the TOF and DOA \nmeasurements assuming propagation via a single, mirror-like reflection and allowing \nthe reflection height to vary freely. The raw data has been smoothed by the application \nof a 20-minute running median in each of the three parameters (TOF, azimuth, and \nelevation). \nType 1: These are characterised at onset by a large sudden increase in time of flight \naccompanied by a sudden deviation of the bearing to the north. Subsequently, the time \nof flight decreases over a period of hours while the azimuth either remains fairly \nconstant or returns slowly to close to the great circle direction. In the example presented \nin Figure 2, there is a second occurrence around 03:00 UT and what may be a second \nhop mode at 04:30 UT. Type 1 events were commonly observed, except in the summer, \nin an earlier (2001 \u2013 close to solar maximum) experiment (see Siddle et al., 2004a for a \nnumber of examples) when they also tended to be longer-lived and were observed on a \nwider range of frequencies. Theoretical considerations, and the reflection points \npresented in Figure 7, indicate that these events are consistent with the signal scattering \nfrom irregularities in the poleward wall of the trough or from the auroral region (Siddle \net al., 2004b). \nType 2: The time of flight gradually increases and is accompanied by a gradual \ndeviation of the azimuth to the north (e.g. see Figure 3). At the same time, there tends to \nbe a decrease in the elevation (although this doesn\u2019t occur in all cases). The rate of \nchange of time of flight and azimuth tends to be fairly constant until, after a period of \nup to a few hours, the signal is no longer detected. At the beginning of the event, instead \nof a gradual change there can be a sudden, small, increase in time of flight and azimuth \ndeviation. This behaviour is then distinguished from a Type 1 event by the subsequent \nincrease of the azimuth deviation and time of flight. The reflection point (see Figure 7) \nstarts clustered around the path mid-point and gradually moves to the north, the signal \nbeing lost when it nears the poleward wall of the trough. \nType 3: The time of flight gradually increases and is accompanied by either a gradual \nsouthward (Type 3S, e.g. see Figure 4; although note that in this particular case a signal \narriving from the north is also sometimes observed) or northward (Type 3N) deviation \nof the azimuth. After a few hours either the signal is no longer detected (as in Figure 4) \nor the azimuth slowly returns to the great circle direction (this distinguishes Type 3N \npropagation from Type 2). Although the elevation angle gradually increases in the \ninterval prior to the azimuth going off circle at about 23:30 UT, after that time the \nelevation angle remains fairly constant. At the start of the interval, the reflection point \n(Figure 7) is centred on the path midpoint, but once the signal goes off great circle it \nreflects from a region close to the equatorward wall of the trough. \nType 4: This type of propagation is characterised by a sudden large increase in the time \nof flight and a strong deviation to the south (typically the azimuth is around 120\u00b0). \nAlthough the signal is usually relatively weak, the example in Figure 5 is a \ncomparatively strong case and is observed at the same time as on-GC propagation. \nAlthough the reflection points (Figure 7) are well to the south, the height of reflection \ngiven by the simple model used is much too high to be realistic. This, together with the \nfact that the elevation is similar for both the on and off-GC modes, is consistent with \nground sidescatter with a ground reflection a few hundred kilometres to the north of that \ngiven in Figure 7 (i.e. in the vicinity of the Alps). \nType 5: This event is similar to the Type 1 event, except that although there is a sudden \nincrease in the time of flight, the signal is deviated to the south instead of the north (see \nFigure 6). Over the next few hours the azimuth usually returns to the great circle \ndirection (as in Figure 6). In this example, the elevation of the on-great circle signal has \nbeen poorly determined (these are the points at zero degrees) probably as a result of the \nrelatively low elevation angle of this E-region mode. However, the elevation for the off-\ngreat circle propagation appears to decrease as the azimuth deviation decreases \n(particularly in the interval from 23:00\u201301:00 UT). In Figure 7, the signal is reflected \nfrom a region close the equatorward wall of the trough. \nThe occurrence (as a percentage of nights of observation) of Types 1, 2, and 4 as a \nfunction of season and frequency is presented in Figure 8. The seasons have been \ndefined according to ITU recommendation P1148 (1997), with spring including all of \nMarch and April, summer including May to August, autumn September and October \nand winter November to February. The results for summer include data from August \n2006 and May\u2013August 2007, while those for autumn include data from September\u2013\nOctober 2006 and September 2007. In Figure 8, Type 1 events are most common in \nspring with no clear trend with frequency (except that they are rarely observed at \n14.36 MHz). For 4.64 MHz, this type of propagation is also common in winter, while \nfor most other frequencies it occurs least often in winter. This behaviour may be \ncontrasted with that observed in 2001 (see Siddle et al, 2004a;b) where Type 1 \npropagation was frequently observed (~40\u201370% of nights depending on frequency) \nexcept in summer. Furthermore, the events observed in 2001 tended to consist of larger \nchanges in time of flight and azimuth and to be of longer duration. Type 2 events tend \nto occur more frequently in spring and, for frequencies in the range 8.01\u201311.12 MHz, in \nthe summer. However, for 6.95 MHz, there is little other seasonal variation, while at \n4.64 and 14.36 MHz the events are rarely observed. In spring, the occurrence strongly \ndepends on frequency, peaking at 10.39 MHz. Type 4 events are also a springtime \nphenomenon, being observed on over 30% of nights for 10.39 and 11.12 MHz, but \nrarely at other frequencies. Of the propagation events not included in Figure 8, Type 3 \nevents are generally rare (<2%) for all frequencies except at 4.64 MHz where they are \nobserved ~7% of nights during the summer. Type 5 propagation is also found on low \nfrequencies, with it being observed on 20% of winter nights and 8% of nights in the \nspring at 4.64 MHz. \nThe occurrence as a function of frequency and Kp for propagation Types 1, 2, and 4 is \npresented in Figure 9. Since the off-great circle events tend to occur before midnight \n(UT), the Kp values given are the average of the 3-hour values between 18:00 and 00:00 \nUT. The averages have then been divided into three bands representing quiet, moderate, \nand disturbed conditions. At frequencies of 8.01 MHz and below, Type 1 propagation \nevents become more frequent as Kp increases, while for frequencies higher than this the \npercentage of nights on which this type of propagation is observed is roughly \nindependent of Kp (although there is some suggestion of a slight decrease in occurrence \nwith increasing Kp). For Type 2 propagation, there is a clear decrease in the occurrence \nof observations with increasing Kp for all frequencies except 4.64 MHz, where the \nopposite is the case. Type 4 propagation is more commonly observed at the middle \nrange of frequencies (8.01\u201311.12 MHz), and becomes more frequent with increasing Kp. \nFor the other propagation types, not shown in the figure, there are insufficient \nobservations to draw any conclusions except at 4.64 MHz. For this frequency, Type 3 \npropagation does not appear to depend on Kp, while Type 5 propagation is slightly more \ncommon at higher Kp. \n3 Discussion and concluding remarks \nThe establishment of multi-frequency HF circuits between Uppsala, Helsinki and \nLeicester has allowed us to observe simultaneously the direction of arrival, time of \nflight, Doppler shift and Doppler spread of signals reflected from the ionosphere. \nDuring the day, the measurements usually show propagation via the F-region along the \nGCP. At night, however, off great circle propagation often occurs which may fall into a \nnumber of categories as described above. The mechanism by which off great circle path \npropagation of Type 1 occurs has been investigated through simulation, the results of \nwhich are reported by in Siddle et al. (2004b). These authors concluded that \npropagation was likely to be via scatter from irregularities embedded within the north \nwall of the trough or slightly to the north in the auroral oval. The frequency of \noccurrence of Type 1 propagation is much lower in the recent measurements than at \nsolar maximum and the seasonal variation has changed, for example, it was commonly \nobserved in winter in 2001, but is not in 2006\u201307. \nIn the recent experiment the other types of propagation have either been much more \ncommon or more significant in terms of duration and azimuth deviation from the great \ncircle than at solar maximum. At this stage of the current investigation (which is still \non-going), we have not completed simulating the events so are not able to firmly \npropose the propagation mechanisms involved, although it anticipated that this will be \nthe subject of a future paper. However, a few tentative suggestions are given below. \nType 2: Preliminary ray tracing has been able to reproduce the form of the azimuth \ndeviation observed with this type of propagation. The reflection point is located in the \ntrough (see Figure 7), but the ionospheric critical frequency is insufficient to reflect the \nsignal suggesting that the signal is scattering from ionospheric irregularities in the floor \nof the trough. However, the modelling has not yet been able to explain why the \ndeviations occur on one day, but not on, otherwise, very similar days. \nType 3: Since these tend to arise when the operating frequency is close to the MUF (and \ngenerally only on 4.64 MHz), and the azimuth deviation and TOF increase tend to be \nsmall, it is likely that these result from refraction from electron density gradients near \nthe equatorward wall of the trough (see Figure 7). \nType 4: The simple model employed here indicates that the propagation is unlikely to \nbe via a single ionospheric reflection. It is possible that the propagation occurs via a 2-\nhop path with the ground reflection well to the south of the propagation path (near to the \nAlps, see Figure 7). A satisfactory simulation will have to explain why this type of \nbehaviour is generally only observed at 10.39 and 11.12 MHz, just before dawn, in \nspring, and is more common at sunspot minimum. \nType 5: These may be due to refraction from the south wall of the trough, the coupling \nof elevation with azimuth (at least some of the time) suggesting that the reflection point \nstarts out relatively close to the receiver and then moves away with time (see Figure 7). \nThey are usually observed on the lowest frequency and more commonly in spring and \nwinter and at sunspot minimum (the gradients in the trough walls vary with solar cycle). \nIt should be noted that there are some limitations to the observations, particularly when \nmore than one propagation mode is present since the system is capable of resolving two \nmodes only if their amplitudes differ by less than about 20dB. At times this is the case \n(e.g. see Figures 3 and 5), but at other times the presences of a strong on great circle \nmode may preclude the observation of a weaker off great circle mode. \nIt is anticipated that eventually the results from this work will enhance our \nunderstanding of HF radio propagation in the trough region and enable the propagation \nprediction models for this region to be improved. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the Swedish Meteorological Institute and the Finnish \nMeteorological Institute for hosting a transmitter at their Marsta and Nurmij\u00e4rvi sites, \nrespectively.
