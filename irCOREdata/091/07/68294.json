Huggel","authors":[],"date":"2008","doi":null,"raw":"collapses is strongly affected by ice recession during deglaciation. Huggel et al. (2008) have noted  460 an upturn in the rate of large-volume avalanches, which corresponds with and is attributed to recent  461 climate change. Similar predictions are made for mountain instabilities due to recession of alpine  462 glaciers (Keiler et al., this volume). Melting and unloading of ice may have a much more rapid effect  463 on edifice stability than on melt production and eruption. Modelling by Huggel (2009) shows that  464 the thermal perturbations that may destabilize slopes are likely to occur over tens or hundreds of  465 years (for conductive heat flow processes) and years to decades (for advective\/convective heat flow  466 processes). Perturbations triggered by volcanic activity may be effective over much shorter time  467 scales.   468 Andean stratovolcanoes that host rapidly-diminishing tropical glaciers are likely to be  469 particularly sensitive to climate warming. Many glaciers are completely out of equilibrium with  470 current climate and may completely disappear within decades (Vuille et al. 2008). Model projections  471 of future climate change in the tropical Andes indicate a continued warming of the tropical  472 troposphere throughout the 21st century, with a temperature increase that is enhanced at higher  473 elevations. By the end of the 21st century, following the SRES A2 emission scenario, the tropical  474 Andes may experience a massive warming on the order of 4.5\u20135 \u00b0C (Vuille et al. 2008). This  475 warming will drive edifice instability both by removing ice, increasing the amount of meltwater at  476 high elevations on edifices and thawing ice-bedrock contacts, encouraging slippage.   477 Climate warming may in some incidences reduce lahar hazards, as the disappearance of small  478 volumes of snow and ice from volcanoes such as Popocatepetl will reduce the volume of ice  479 available for meltwater flood generation. Dwindling areas of ice and snow will also reduce the  480 probability of lahar generation. This reduction in lahar hazards may only be notable in volcanoes  481 undergoing almost complete glacier extinction (Huggel et al. 2007a).   482 23  483 7. Gaps in our knowledge and targets for future research  484 485 Important gaps in our knowledge of links between melting of ice and  volcanic hazards remain,  486 which include:  487 488 1) Uncertainty about the timescale of volcanic responses to ice unloading. We currently have only  489 limited insight into the reasons for delayed volcanic responses (Maclennan et al. 2002) and the  490 timescales involved (Jellinek et al. 2004); response times are likely to differ in different tectonic  491 settings.  492 2) Poor constraint on how ice bodies on volcanoes will respond to 21 st century climate change.  493 The highly localised effects of topography, microclimates and local geothermal and eruption-related  494 processes on volcanoes conspire to create considerable diversity in the response of individual  495 glaciers and ice sheets to climate change (e.g. Geirsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2006, Rivera et al. 2006, Bown and  496 Rivera 2007, Brock et al. 2007).   497 3) The sensitivity of volcanoes to small changes in ice thickness or to recession of small glaciers on  498 their flanks is unknown. Although there is strong evidence that wholesale ice removal during  499 deglaciation can significant accelerate volcanic activity there is considerable uncertainty about how  500 volcanic responses to unloading scale with the magnitude, rate and distribution of ice unloading. A  501 simple linear relationship between the rates of ice melting and additional melt production is unlikely  502 to be appropriate. The effects of recession of different scales of ice body need to be considered, from  503 the largest ice sheets to the smallest summit glaciers.  504 4) Lack of data on how past changes in ice thickness have affected the style of volcanic eruptions  505 and associated hazards.

The short time delay between inferred ice unloading and  237 enhanced volcanism shows that the \u201cextra\u201d magma generated is rapidly transported from source to  238 surface without prolonged storage in magma chambers, so that Icelandic volcanism responds swiftly  239 to changes in ice thickness. In most other volcanic settings magma accumulation in chambers is the  240 norm (e.g. volcanic arcs), in which case the mechanism for enhanced volcanism may differ. It may  241 reflect the response of magma chambers to unloading, rather than the eruption of primitive melts  242 directly to the surface.  243 Statistical analyses of eruption databases have shown quantitatively that patterns of volcanic  244 activity elsewhere are also influenced by changes in ice thickness: both globally (Huybers and  245 Langmuir 2009, Fig. 6a), in Eastern California (Jellinek et al. 2004, Fig. 6b) and in western Europe  246 (Nowell et al. 2006). It is important to note that most statistical studies use a global climate proxy  247 from marine \u03b4 18O records as an indication of ice thickness changes, rather than local ice thickness  248 changes on volcanoes themselves (which are poorly constrained). Further, only the number of  249 eruptions is considered in analyses, rather the volume of eruptions. Huybers and Langmuir (2009)  250 used a database of global eruptions in the last 40 ka (Siebert and Simkin 2002) to calculate the  251 change in frequency of eruptions with VEI>2 prior to, during and after the last deglaciation. The  252 increase in volcanic activity during deglaciation above modern values was found to be statistically  253 highly significant (p < 0.01) and activity during deglaciation (18-7 ka) was significantly higher than  254 glacial rates between 40-20 ka.

Rapid melting, fracturing and mechanical erosion during eruptions can cause dramatic,  190 localised thinning of ice above vents (Fig. 4a) and meltwater drainage pathways (e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson  191 et al. 1997), with removal of tens or hundreds of metres of ice in hours. Perturbations to the ice  192 surface may be transient, however, as depressions formed may swiftly fill due to increased snow  193 deposition and inward deformation of surrounding ice (A\u00f0algeirsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2000).   194 There is strong evidence that volcanic and geothermal activity is hastening the demise of ice  195 bodies on some volcanoes. Eruptive activity at Popocatepetl, Mexico from 1994 to 2001 led to the  196 complete extinction of its small (<1 km 2) summit glaciers (Fig. 4b; Julio-Miranda et al. 2008). This  197 extinction reflects the negligible accumulation at a volcano located in an intertropical zone, which  198 makes its glacier mass balance extremely sensitive to eruption-triggered ablation. It is speculated  199 that the disappearance of ice on Popocatepetl was inevitable due to climate change, but greatly  200 hastened by eruptive activity (Julio-Miranda et al. 2008). Recent changes in the mass balance of  201 glaciers on Villarrica volcano, Chile reflect the effects of tephra cover on the ice surface (Rivera et  202 al. 2006). At Villarrica mass balance is also strongly influenced by basal geothermal fluxes. Tephra  203 cover drives enhanced melting when tephra is thin due to enhanced heat absorption, but thicker  204 layers may insulate ice and snow and reduce melting (Rivera et al. 2006, Brock et al. 2007).  205 Melting and mechanical removal of ice during the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz,  206 Columbia removed approximately 10 % of the volume of ice on the volcano (Ceballos et al. 2006,  207 Huggel et al. 2007a), which totalled 0.48 km 3 in 2003. This demonstrates that a single moderately  208 large volcanic eruption (VEI 3) can have an appreciable impact on the mass balance of ice on  209 11  Andean stratovolcanoes, due to the low ice accumulation rates on tropical glaciers (Ceballos et al.  210 2006).  211 By contrast, even considerable volcanically-triggered melting probably has a negligible  212 effect on the mass balance of Iceland\u2019s Vatnaj\u00f6kull ice sheet over a decadal timescale. This is  213 because Icelandic glaciers and ice sheets are characterised by high annual accumulation and ablation  214 due to temperate conditions and extremely high precipitation (Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008). At  215 Vatnaj\u00f6kull on average 0.55 km 3 a -1 was melted by volcanic eruptions during the period 1995-2008,  216 but this amounted to only 4 % of the total surface ablation from the ice sheet during this period (13  217 km 3, Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008).  However, the effects of geothermal heat fluxes may have  218 significant effects on ice dynamics and mass balance over both long and short timescales: models of  219 the volume of Vatnaj\u00f6kull at the last glacial maximum are highly sensitive to basal geothermal heat  220 fluxes (Hubbard 2006) and eruption-triggered j\u00f6kulhlaups may also trigger surging, which affects  221 glacier mass balance (Bj\u00f6rnsson 1998, Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008).   222 223 224 3. How has ice recession affected volcanic activity in the past?  225 226 3.1. Evidence for accelerated volcanism triggered by deglaciation  227 There is strengthening quantitative evidence linking periods of deglaciation with increased volcanic  228 activity in many different volcanic settings. The best established and most dramatic acceleration in  229 activity occurred in Iceland, where vigorous volcanism is strongly affected by a temperate ice sheet  230 that may almost completely cover the island during glacial periods and almost completely disappear  231 during interglacials (Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008).

For example, Vatnaj\u00f6kull in Iceland has only shrunk since 1890 (Bj\u00f6rnsson and  302 P\u00e1lsson 2008, Pagli and Sigmundsson 2008). This means that total thinning of only ~60 m has  303 occurred at Vatnaj\u00f6kull since 1890, compared with ~2 km during the last deglaciation (Fig. 7).  304 Tropical glaciers in the Andes reached their maximum extents of the last millennium at between  305 1630 and 1730 AD (Jomelli et al. 2009) and have only rapidly retreated since the middle of the 19 th  306 century. Therefore current thinning has only been sustained over a 100-200 year period, which is  307 considerably shorter than major deglaciation events. As a consequence the total reduction in ice  308 thickness to date during current warming is probably less than 10 % of that during major past  309 deglaciation events.   310 However, there are marked local and regional discrepancies in how rapidly ice sheets and  311 glaciers have receded during current (post-Little Ice Age) warming. Over 3030 km 3 if ice has been  312 lost from Glacier Bay, Alaska since 1770 (Larsen et al. 2005), with local thinning of up to 1.5 km at  313 a mean rate of up to 6.5 m a -1. This value is more comparable to changes during the main phases of  314 deglaciation, but has not occurred in an active volcanic region.   315 316 317 5. How might hazards be affected by melting of ice and snow?  318 319 5.1. Ice unloading may encourage more explosive eruptions  320 The explosivity of eruptions beneath ice sheets is restrained by thick ice, as high glaciostatic  321 pressures (>5 MPa) inhibit volatile exsolution (Tuffen et al. 2010) and rapid ice deformation can  322 close cavities melted at the base of the ice, encouraging intrusive rather than explosive activity (Fig.  323 8; Tuffen et al. 2007). Thinning of ice covering a volcano may therefore encourage more explosive  324 16  eruptions, which generate meltwater more rapidly than intrusive eruptions (Gu\u00f0mundsson 2003)  325 and, if the ice surface were breached, create hazards associated with tephra. Where ice is thin (<150  326 m) there is generally comparatively little interaction between magma and meltwater, as thin ice  327 fractures readily, offers little constraint to the force of eruptions and is inefficient at collecting  328 meltwater around the vent (Smellie and Skilling 1994, Smellie 1999). Thinning of ice may therefore  329 generally lead to more explosive eruptions at volcanoes that are currently covered by substantial  330 thicknesses of ice (>300 m), especially those with deep ice-filled summit calderas such as Sollipulli,  331 Chile (Gilbert et al. 1996) and Katla, Iceland (Bj\u00f6rnsson et al. 2000). It is important to note,  332 however, that there is currently no quantitative relationship between eruption explosivity and ice  333 thickness. The models quoted only simulate a small part of the coupled volcano-ice system and thus  334 are essentially qualitative; they do not incorporate feedbacks between the dynamics of magma  335 storage, ascent and the response of the overlying ice.    336 337 5.2. Ice unloading and increased melting may trigger edifice stability  338 It has been hypothesised that melting and recession of ice on volcanic edifices may lead to instability  339 and edifice collapse due to two independent mechanisms: firstly, debuttressing and the withdrawal of  340 mechanical support from ice (Capra 2008) and secondly, an increase in the pore fluid pressure within  341 shallow hydrothermal systems, which may trigger movement on pre-existing weaknesses (Capra  342 2008). However, this hypothesis currently remains unproven due to insufficient data. A significant  343 proportion of glacier meltwater may enter the hydrothermal system of volcanoes (e.g. Antizana  344 volcano, Ecuador, Favier et al. 2008). Seasonal seismicity at volcanoes such as Mt Hood (USA) is  345 consistent with seismic triggering by an increase in meltwater input (Saar and Manga 2003),  346 17  illustrating that movement on pre-existing weaknesses is favoured by enhanced meltwater  347 production.   348 349 5.3. Melting of ice and snow may decrease the likelihood and magnitude of meltwater floods  350 As the volume of ice and snow on a volcano decreases, the size of the reservoir of potential  351 meltwater decreases. At volcanoes where a relatively small volume of ice and snow is present the  352 total volume of lahars may be restricted by the volume of ice and snow available for melting  353 (Huggel et al. 2007a). This leads to the following qualitative prediction: as this volume decreases the  354 total volume and magnitude of meltwater floods should decrease for a given size of eruption, thus  355 reducing the associated hazards. Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson (2008) have shown that meltwater discharge  356 from thinning Icelandic glaciers is likely to peak in 2040-2050 as ablation rates rise, but thereafter  357 recede, reflecting the diminished volume of ice available for melting. Futhermore, as meltwater  358 floods are triggered when tephra falls onto ice and snow (Major and Newhall 1989, Walder 2000,  359 Julio-Miranda et al. 2008), a reduction in the area of ice and snow will reduce the probability that  360 this will occur, therefore reducing the incidence of lahar generation. However, if the size of  361 eruptions were to increase then in some cases a dwindling ice volume would not prevent an increase  362 in the magnitude of meltwater floods, as recognised by Huggel et al. (2007a).   363 364 6. What are the likely effects of 21 st century climate change on hazards at ice-covered  365 volcanoes?  366 367 Unloading as ice and snow melt may trigger increased volcanic activity.

Key questions include how 7 \nrapidly volcanic systems react to melting of ice, whether volcanoes are sensitive to small changes in 8 \nice thickness, and how recession of ice affects the generation, storage and eruption of magma at 9 \nstratovolcanoes. A greater frequency of collapse events at glaciated stratovolcanoes can be expected 10 \nin the near future, and there is strong potential for positive feedbacks between melting of ice and 11 \nenhanced volcanism. Nonetheless, much further research is required to remove current uncertainties 12 \nabout the implications of climate change for volcanic hazards in the 21st century. 13 \n 14 \nKey index words or phrases 15 \nVolcanic hazards, climate change, volcano-ice interaction, ice sheets, glaciers, lahars 16 \n2 \n \n1.1. Introduction 17 \n 18 \nThere is growing evidence that past changes in the thickness of ice covering volcanoes has affected 19 \ntheir eruptive activity. Dating of Icelandic lavas has shown that the rate of volcanic activity in 20 \nIceland accelerated by a factor of 30-50 following the last deglaciation at ~12 ka (Maclennan et al. 21 \n2002). Analyses of local and global eruption databases have identified a statistically significant 22 \ncorrelation between periods of climatic warming associated with recession of ice and an increase in 23 \nthe frequency of eruptions (Jellinek et al. 2004, Nowell et al. 2006, Huybers and Langmuir 2009). 24 \nToday the bodies of ice found on many volcanoes are rapidly thinning and receding. These bodies 25 \nrange from extensive ice sheets to small tropical glaciers and thinning is thought to be triggered by 26 \ncontemporary climate change (e.g. Rivera et al. 2006, Vuille et al. 2008, Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 27 \n2008).  28 \nThis leads to the following question: will the current ice recession provoke increased 29 \nvolcanic activity and lead to increased exposure to volcanic hazards? In this paper I analyse our 30 \ncurrent knowledge of how ice thickness variations influence volcanism and identify several 31 \nunresolved issues that currently prevent quantitative assessment of whether activity is likely to 32 \naccelerate in the coming century. These include the poorly-constrained response time of volcanic 33 \nsystems to unloading of ice, uncertainty about how acceleration in volcanic activity scales to the rate 34 \nand total amount of melting, and the lack of models to simulate how melting of ice on 35 \nstratovolcanoes may affect magma storage and eruption to the surface. In conclusion I highlight 36 \nsome of the future research needed for better understanding of how melting of ice may force 37 \nvolcanic activity.   38 \n 39 \n3 \n \n 40 \n1.2. What are hazards at ice and snow-covered volcanoes and where are they found? 41 \n 42 \nMany volcanoes are mantled by ice and snow, especially those located at high latitudes or that reach 43 \nover 4000 m in altitude. Notable examples occur in the Andes, the Cascades, the Aleutian-44 \nKamchatkan arc, Iceland, Antarctica, Japan and New Zealand (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The nature of ice and 45 \nsnow cover spans a broad spectrum from seasonal snow (Mee et al. 2006), small bodies of ice and 46 \nfirn in summit regions (Houghton et al. 1987, Julio-Miranda et al. 2008), larger alpine glaciers on 47 \nvolcano flanks (Fig. 1b, Fig. 2a, e.g. Rivera et al. 2006, Vuille et al. 2008), thick ice accumulations 48 \nwithin summit craters and calderas (e.g. Gilbert et al. 1996, Huggel et al. 2007a), to substantial ice 49 \nsheets that completely cover volcanic systems (Fig. 2b, e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson et al. 1997, Corr and 50 \nVaughan 2008). 51 \n Historical eruptions at more than 40 volcanoes worldwide have involved disruption of ice 52 \nand snow (Major and Newhall 1989), whereas numerous geological studies have enabled the 53 \nrecognition of interactions between volcanoes and ice or snow in ancient eruptions (e.g. Noe-54 \nNygaard 1940, Mathews 1951, Gilbert et al. 1996, Smellie 1999, Lescinsky and Fink 2000, Mee et 55 \nal. 2006). Volcanic deposits provide an invaluable record of palaeo-environmental change, such as 56 \nfluctuations in ice thickness and extent (Smellie et al. 2008, Smellie 2008, Tuffen et al. 2010), as 57 \nwell as the processes and hazards associated with various types of volcano-ice interaction (e.g. 58 \nSmellie and Skilling 1994, Smellie 1999, Lescinsky and Fink 2000, Tuffen and Castro 2009, 59 \nCarrivick 2007). 60 \n 61 \n1.3. Hazards at ice- and snow-covered volcanoes 62 \n4 \n \n 63 \nThe presence of ice and snow on volcanoes can greatly magnify hazards, principally because 64 \nperturbation of ice and snow during eruptions can rapidly generate large volumes of meltwater that 65 \nare released in destructive lahars and floods. Major and Newhall (1989) compiled a comprehensive 66 \nglobal review of historical eruptions at more than 40 volcanoes during which ice and snow were 67 \nperturbed and lahars or floods generated. Major loss of life occurred in several eruptions, including 68 \nNevados de Ruiz (Columbia, 1985), Villarrica (Chile, 1971), Tokachi-dake (Japan, 1926) and 69 \nCotopaxi (Ecuador, 1877).  70 \n   71 \nPertubation of ice and snow by volcanic activity. Major and Newhall identified five distinct 72 \nmechanisms that can cause perturbation of snow and ice or volcanoes: (1) mechanical erosion and 73 \nmelting by flowing pyroclastic debris or blasts of hot gases (e.g. Walder 2000), (2) melting of the ice 74 \nor snow surface by lava flows (e.g. Mee et al. 2006), (3) basal melting by subglacial eruptions or 75 \ngeothermal activity (e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson et al. 1997), (4) ejection of water by eruptions through a 76 \ncrater lake, and (5) deposition of tephra onto ice and snow (e.g. Capra et al. 2004).  77 \n Subsequently, observations of volcanic activity in Columbia, Iceland, USA, New Zealand 78 \nand Alaska (Waitt 1989, Pierson et al., 1990, Gu\u00f0mundsson et al. 1997, 2004, 2008; Carrivick et al. 79 \n2009a) have highlighted how rapidly meltwater may be generated during melting of the base of ice 80 \nsheets and glaciers, and when pyroclastic debris move over ice and snow. Melting rates may exceed 81 \n0.5 km3 per day during powerful subglacial eruptions (e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson et al. 2004). The hazards 82 \nassociated with meltwater production are exacerbated when transient accumulation occurs with 83 \ncraters or calderas, as this can lead to even higher release rates of meltwater when catastrophic 84 \n5 \n \ndrainage is triggered by dam collapse or floating of an ice barrier that allows rapid subglacial 85 \ndrainage (Pierson et al. 1990, Gu\u00f0mundsson et al. 1997, Carrivick et al. 2004, 2009a).  86 \nThe magnitude of meltwater floods (j\u00f6kulhlaups and lahars) can exceed 40 000 m3 s-1 (Major 87 \nand Newhall 1989, Pierson et al. 1990, Gu\u00f0mundsson et al. 2004, 2008), creating significant hazards 88 \nin river valleys and on outwash plains many tens of kilometres from the site of melting (Fig. 1c,d; 89 \nFig. 2b; e.g. Pierson et al. 1990, Eliasson et al. 2006, Huggel et al. 2007a). The total volume of 90 \nmeltwater floods may be restricted by either the amount of pyroclastic material or lava available to 91 \ncause melting, or the volume of ice and snow that can be melted. 92 \n 93 \nExplosive eruptions. The hazards posed by explosive eruptions at ice- and snow-covered volcanoes 94 \nare typical of those at other volcanoes, with the following important modifications: 1) Interactions 95 \nbetween magma and meltwater may trigger phreatomagmatic activity (Fig. 1a), even during basaltic 96 \neruptions that would not otherwise be explosive (e.g. Smellie and Skilling 1994, Gu\u00f0mundsson et al. 97 \n1997). 2) When ice is thick the explosive phase of eruptions may partly or entirely take place 98 \nbeneath the ice surface (Tuffen 2007), reducing the hazards associated with ashfall and pyroclastic 99 \ndebris. 3) If explosive eruptions do occur then widespread perturbation of ice and snow by 100 \npyroclastic material may be important, both at the vent area and in more distal areas.  101 \n 102 \nEdifice instability and collapse. Ice-and snow-covered volcanic edifices are especially prone to 103 \ncollapse, creating hazardous debris avalanches that may convert to lahars (e.g. Huggel et al. 104 \n2007a,b) and reach many tens of kilometres from their source. Collapse is favoured by 1) constraint 105 \nby ice, which may encourage the development of structurally unstable, oversteepened edifices, 2) 106 \nmelting of ice, which may create weak zones at ice-bedrock interfaces (Huggel 2009) and 3) shallow 107 \n6 \n \nhydrothermal alteration driven by snow and ice melt, which can greatly weaken volcanic edifices 108 \n(e.g. Carrasco-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 1993, Huggel 2009). Ice avalanches are a newly-recognised 109 \nphenomenon that may occur at ice-covered volcanoes (Fig. 2a; Huggel et al. 2007b). Ice avalanches 110 \nranging from 0.1 to 20 \u00d7 106 m3 in volume originate from steep areas near the summit of Iliama 111 \nvolcano, Alaska, where the geothermal flux is high. These avalanches travel up to 10 km down the 112 \nvolcano flanks at speeds of 20-70 m s-1 (Huggel 2009). The thermal perturbations that can trigger 113 \nslope failure include volcanic\/geothermal, glacier-permafrost and climatically-induced warming.  114 \n 115 \nThe distribution of hazards at active ice and snow-covered volcanoes such as Citlaltepetl, Mexico 116 \n(lahars; Hubbard et al. 2007), Nevado de Ruiz, Columbia (lahars, avalanches; Huggel et al. 2007a), 117 \nMt Rainier, Washington (lahars; Hoblitt et al. 1998), Ruapehu, New Zealand (lahars; Houghton et 118 \nal. 1987), Iliama, Alaska (lahars, avalanches; Waythomas and Miller 1999, Huggel et al. 2007b) and 119 \nKatla, Iceland (j\u00f6kulhlaups, Bj\u00f6rnsson et al. 2000) reflect these different sources of volcanic hazard, 120 \nprincipally meltwater floods, which potentially affect millions of people living close to these 121 \nvolcanoes. 122 \n 123 \n2. How is ice thickness on volcanoes currently changing? 124 \n 125 \nRapid thinning and recession of ice has been noted on many active and potentially-active volcanoes, 126 \nincluding Popocatepetl and other Mexican volcanoes (Julio-Miranda et al. 2008), Columbian 127 \nstratovolcanoes (Huggel et al. 2007a), Villarrica and other Chilean volcanoes (Rivera et al. 2006) 128 \nand Kilimanjaro, Tanzania (Fig. 3; Thompson et al. 2009). Ice sheets covering volcanic systems are 129 \nalso rapidly thinning, including Vatnaj\u00f6kull in Iceland (Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008) and parts of the 130 \n7 \n \nWest Antarctic Ice Sheet (Wingham et al. 2009). Selected measured or estimated rates of ice 131 \nthinning and recession are provided in Table 1.  132 \n Whereas the changing mass balance of thick ice sheets is predominantly manifested in a 133 \nreduction in ice surface elevation and therefore in ice thickness (e.g. Wingham et al. 2009), the 134 \nsurface area of smaller glaciers on many volcanoes is rapidly reducing, along with a rapid decrease 135 \nin ice volume. Rates of thinning vary from 0.54 m a-1 on Kilimanjaro (Thompson et al. 2009) to 1.6 136 \nm a-1 (Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctic Ice Sheet; Wingham et al. 2009). Assuming that current 137 \nrates of ice loss continue over the coming century, ice bodies on numerous volcanoes may therefore 138 \nthin by ~50 to 150 metres by 2100. Stratovolcanoes hosting thin glaciers, such as Kilimanjaro, may 139 \ntherefore become completely ice-free in the coming century (Thompson et al. 2009). At some 140 \nvolcanoes this has already occurred, such as at Popocatepetl, Mexico where dramatic extinction of 141 \nsummit ice over the last 50 years reached completion in 2004 (Julio-Miranda et al. 2008).  142 \n 143 \n 144 \n 145 \n 146 \n 147 \n 148 \n 149 \n  150 \n151 \n8 \n \n 152 \nVolcano Last \neruption \nArea or volume \nof ice \nRate of thinning  Reference \nVatnaj\u00f6kull, \nIceland \n2004, \n1998, \n1996 \nA = 8100 km2 \nV = 3100 km3 (in \n2000) \n0.8 m a-1 average (1995-2008) \nGeothermal melting and eruptions \nmelted 0.55 km3 a-1, annual \nsurface ablation 13 km3 a-1.  \nPagli and \nSigmundsson \n2008, Bj\u00f6rnsson \nand P\u00e1lsson 2008 \nVolc\u00e1n Villarrica, \nChile \n2005, \n2007, \n2008 \n \nA = 30.3 km2 \n \n0.81 \u00b10.45 m a-1 (1961-2004) \n \n \nRivera et al. 2006 \nPopocatepetl, \nMexico \n1994-\n2001 \nWas 0.729 km2 in \n1958, now 0 km2 \n1996 ~0.2 m a-1 \n1999 ~4 m a-1 \nJulio-Miranda et al \n2008 \nNevado del \nRuiz, Columbia \n \n1991 \nA = 19-25 km2 \n(1985), 10.3 km2 \n(2002-2003) \n \nNot known \nCeballos et al. \n2006, Huggel et al. \n2007a \nCotopaxi, \nEcuador \n \n1940 \nA = 19.2 km2 \n(1976), 13.4 km2 \n(1997) \n \n3-4 m a-1 on snouts \n \nJordan et al. 2005 \nKilimanjaro, \nKenya\/Tanzania \n150-200 \nka \nA = 2.5 km2 \n(2000), 1.85 km2 \n(2007) \n \n0.54 m a-1 \nThompson et al. \n2009 \n \nWest Antarctic \nIce Sheet \n \n~2 ka? \n \nV = 2.2 x 106 km3 \n \nPine Island Glacier ~1.6 m\/a, \naccelerating over 1995-2006. \nLythe and Vaughan \n2001, Shepherd et \nal 2001, Corr and \nVaughan 2008, \nWingham et al \n2009.  \nTable 1. Current estimated rates of ice thinning and recession at selected volcanoes and ice sheets. 153 \n 154 \n 155 \n2.1. Ice thinning due to climate change 156 \nMuch of the current recession and thinning of glaciers and ice sheets covering volcanoes is attributed 157 \nto the effects of global climate change, with increasing mean temperature and in some cases 158 \ndecreasing precipitation leading to negative glacier mass balance changes (e.g. Rivera et al. 2006, 159 \nBown and Rivera 2007, Vuille et al. 2008). The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is the altitude on a 160 \nglacier where the annual accumulation and ablation rates are exactly balanced. The ELA of glaciers 161 \non Chilean stratovolcanoes such as Villarrica has migrated upwards by ~100 m between 1976 and 162 \n2004\/2005 (Rivera et al. 2006), partly due to a mean temperature increase at 2000 m elevation of 163 \n9 \n \n0.023 \u00b0C a-1 (Bown and Rivera 2007). Ice thinning on Popocatepetl between 1958 and 1994 is 164 \nlikewise thought to be related to climatic change (Julio-Miranda et al. 2008), as is dramatic thinning 165 \nof tropical mountain glaciers on Ecuadorian volcanoes such as Antizana and Cotopaxi (Vuille et al. 166 \n2008) 167 \nThinning of Vatnaj\u00f6kull ice sheet in Iceland is also pronounced, with an average thinning of 168 \n0.8 m a-1 between 1995 and 2008 (Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008, Pagli and Sigmundsson 2008). 169 \nFuture prediction of mass balance changes at Vatnaj\u00f6kull in the coming century, which incorporate 170 \nglacier dynamic models with predicted increases in mean temperature (2.8 \u00b0C) and precipitation (6 171 \n%) project a 25 % volume loss by 2060 (Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008). The effects of climate change 172 \non the mass balance of glaciers and ice sheets on volcanoes is likely to be strongly location-specific. 173 \nThis is because changes in temperature and precipitation are spatially heterogeneous and glacier 174 \ndynamics highly variable. This local sensitivity is illustrated by the contrasting recession rates of 175 \nglaciers on neighbouring Chilean volcanoes less than 50 km apart (e.g. Rivera et al. 2006, Bown and 176 \nRivera 2007) and highlights the importance of studying individual ice-covered volcanoes, rather than 177 \napplying a regional or global climate change model (Huybers and Langmuir 2009) to predict local 178 \nchanges in ice thickness on specific volcanoes. 179 \n 180 \n2.2. Ice thinning due to volcanic and geothermal activity 181 \nVolcanic and geothermal activity can strongly influence the mass balance of ice bodies on volcanoes 182 \nboth during eruptions and periods of quiescence. The \u201cbackground\u201d ablation and accumulation rates 183 \ndetermine the overall effects of volcanic and geothermal activity on glacier mass balance and 184 \ndynamics (Magnusson et al. 2005, Gu\u00f0mundsson et al. 2009). Mechanisms of ice loss include basal 185 \nmelting and ice disruption during and after subglacial eruptive activity (Fig. 4a; e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson 186 \n10 \n \net al. 1997, Jarosch and Gu\u00f0mundsson 2007), melting of the ice and snow surface by the heat of 187 \nerupted debris (Julio-Miranda et al. 2008), changes to surface albedo due to tephra cover (Fig. 4b; 188 \nRivera et al. 2006), and lubrication by sustained basal melting due to geothermal heat (e.g. Bell 189 \n2008). Rapid melting, fracturing and mechanical erosion during eruptions can cause dramatic, 190 \nlocalised thinning of ice above vents (Fig. 4a) and meltwater drainage pathways (e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson 191 \net al. 1997), with removal of tens or hundreds of metres of ice in hours. Perturbations to the ice 192 \nsurface may be transient, however, as depressions formed may swiftly fill due to increased snow 193 \ndeposition and inward deformation of surrounding ice (A\u00f0algeirsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2000).  194 \n There is strong evidence that volcanic and geothermal activity is hastening the demise of ice 195 \nbodies on some volcanoes. Eruptive activity at Popocatepetl, Mexico from 1994 to 2001 led to the 196 \ncomplete extinction of its small (<1 km2) summit glaciers (Fig. 4b; Julio-Miranda et al. 2008). This 197 \nextinction reflects the negligible accumulation at a volcano located in an intertropical zone, which 198 \nmakes its glacier mass balance extremely sensitive to eruption-triggered ablation. It is speculated 199 \nthat the disappearance of ice on Popocatepetl was inevitable due to climate change, but greatly 200 \nhastened by eruptive activity (Julio-Miranda et al. 2008). Recent changes in the mass balance of 201 \nglaciers on Villarrica volcano, Chile reflect the effects of tephra cover on the ice surface (Rivera et 202 \nal. 2006). At Villarrica mass balance is also strongly influenced by basal geothermal fluxes. Tephra 203 \ncover drives enhanced melting when tephra is thin due to enhanced heat absorption, but thicker 204 \nlayers may insulate ice and snow and reduce melting (Rivera et al. 2006, Brock et al. 2007). 205 \n Melting and mechanical removal of ice during the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz, 206 \nColumbia removed approximately 10 % of the volume of ice on the volcano (Ceballos et al. 2006, 207 \nHuggel et al. 2007a), which totalled 0.48 km3 in 2003. This demonstrates that a single moderately 208 \nlarge volcanic eruption (VEI 3) can have an appreciable impact on the mass balance of ice on 209 \n11 \n \nAndean stratovolcanoes, due to the low ice accumulation rates on tropical glaciers (Ceballos et al. 210 \n2006). 211 \n By contrast, even considerable volcanically-triggered melting probably has a negligible 212 \neffect on the mass balance of Iceland\u2019s Vatnaj\u00f6kull ice sheet over a decadal timescale. This is 213 \nbecause Icelandic glaciers and ice sheets are characterised by high annual accumulation and ablation 214 \ndue to temperate conditions and extremely high precipitation (Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008). At 215 \nVatnaj\u00f6kull on average 0.55 km3 a-1 was melted by volcanic eruptions during the period 1995-2008, 216 \nbut this amounted to only 4 % of the total surface ablation from the ice sheet during this period (13 217 \nkm3, Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008). However, the effects of geothermal heat fluxes may have 218 \nsignificant effects on ice dynamics and mass balance over both long and short timescales: models of 219 \nthe volume of Vatnaj\u00f6kull at the last glacial maximum are highly sensitive to basal geothermal heat 220 \nfluxes (Hubbard 2006) and eruption-triggered j\u00f6kulhlaups may also trigger surging, which affects 221 \nglacier mass balance (Bj\u00f6rnsson 1998, Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008).  222 \n  223 \n 224 \n3. How has ice recession affected volcanic activity in the past? 225 \n 226 \n3.1. Evidence for accelerated volcanism triggered by deglaciation 227 \nThere is strengthening quantitative evidence linking periods of deglaciation with increased volcanic 228 \nactivity in many different volcanic settings. The best established and most dramatic acceleration in 229 \nactivity occurred in Iceland, where vigorous volcanism is strongly affected by a temperate ice sheet 230 \nthat may almost completely cover the island during glacial periods and almost completely disappear 231 \nduring interglacials (Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson 2008). Unloading of hundreds of metres to 2 km of ice 232 \n12 \n \nduring deglaciation in Iceland causes decompression that, according to current models, leads to a 233 \ngreater degree and depth range of mantle melting (Jull and McKenzie 1996, Maclennan et al. 2002). 234 \nThis is reflected in a 30- to 50-fold increase in the rate of magma eruption on individual volcanic 235 \nsystems in the 1.5 ka after the deglaciation of each area, inferred from the volume of erupted 236 \ndeposits (Fig. 5; Maclennan et al. 2002). The short time delay between inferred ice unloading and 237 \nenhanced volcanism shows that the \u201cextra\u201d magma generated is rapidly transported from source to 238 \nsurface without prolonged storage in magma chambers, so that Icelandic volcanism responds swiftly 239 \nto changes in ice thickness. In most other volcanic settings magma accumulation in chambers is the 240 \nnorm (e.g. volcanic arcs), in which case the mechanism for enhanced volcanism may differ. It may 241 \nreflect the response of magma chambers to unloading, rather than the eruption of primitive melts 242 \ndirectly to the surface. 243 \n Statistical analyses of eruption databases have shown quantitatively that patterns of volcanic 244 \nactivity elsewhere are also influenced by changes in ice thickness: both globally (Huybers and 245 \nLangmuir 2009, Fig. 6a), in Eastern California (Jellinek et al. 2004, Fig. 6b) and in western Europe 246 \n(Nowell et al. 2006). It is important to note that most statistical studies use a global climate proxy 247 \nfrom marine \u03b418O records as an indication of ice thickness changes, rather than local ice thickness 248 \nchanges on volcanoes themselves (which are poorly constrained). Further, only the number of 249 \neruptions is considered in analyses, rather the volume of eruptions. Huybers and Langmuir (2009) 250 \nused a database of global eruptions in the last 40 ka (Siebert and Simkin 2002) to calculate the 251 \nchange in frequency of eruptions with VEI>2 prior to, during and after the last deglaciation. The 252 \nincrease in volcanic activity during deglaciation above modern values was found to be statistically 253 \nhighly significant (p < 0.01) and activity during deglaciation (18-7 ka) was significantly higher than 254 \nglacial rates between 40-20 ka. Although there are doubts about the completeness of the eruption 255 \n13 \n \nrecord, interesting trends emerge from the data. The timing of enhanced volcanism differs between 256 \nlocalities (e.g. a global increase occurred at ~18 ka, but occurred later in Iceland, at ~12 ka). This 257 \nmay reflect differing regional deglaciation histories, although other factors such as the delay between 258 \ndeglaciation and magma reaching the surface may also differ and depend upon the plumbing system 259 \nof individual volcanic complexes. There is currently no discussion in the literature about whether the 260 \nmagnitude of volcanic eruptions increases during deglaciation, or whether it is only the frequency of 261 \neruptions that is affected. 262 \n Qualitative evidence for accelerated volcanism at individual volcanic complexes during 263 \ndeglaciation includes studies at Mt Mazama, western USA (Bacon and Lamphere 2006) and three 264 \nChilean volcanoes: Lascar, Puyehue and Nevados de Chillan (Gardeweg et al. 1998, Singer et al. 265 \n2008, Mee et al. 2009). However confidence about whether glacial-interglacial cycles truly influence 266 \neruptive activity is generally low, as there are insufficient dated eruptions at individual volcanoes to 267 \nadequately test statistical significances. In some cases there is no obvious increase in activity during 268 \nthe last deglaciation (e.g. Torfaj\u00f6kull, Iceland; McGarvie et al. 2006). 269 \n  270 \n3.2. Edifice collapse triggered by ice recession 271 \nA mechanistic link between deglaciation and collapse of ice-covered stratovolcanoes has been 272 \nproposed by Capra (2008), who noted the coincidence between major edifice collapses and periods 273 \nof rapid ice recession in the last 30 ka for 24 volcanoes, predominantly located in Chile, Mexico and 274 \nthe USA. Capra proposed that abrupt climate change resulting in rapid ice melting may trigger 275 \nedifice collapses through glacial debuttressing and an increase in fluid circulation and humidity. 276 \nHowever, more data is required to quantitatively test whether periods of rapid ice decline do indeed 277 \ncorrelate with acceleration in the incidence of edifice collapse. 278 \n14 \n \n 279 \n4. How does the rate and extent of current ice melting compare with past changes? 280 \nIn order to assess whether the current changes in ice thickness and extent on many volcanoes are 281 \nlikely to trigger accelerated volcanic activity the current rate of melting must be compared with 282 \ninferred rates of melting during the last deglaciation. Precisely reconstructing rates of ice thinning 283 \nduring the last deglaciation is problematic, due to the limits of resolution provided by proxies for 284 \nchanging ice extent and thickness. Furthermore, the history of deglaciation was complex, with major 285 \nstepwise advances and retreats including the Younger Dryas event at 11-10 ka and the Preboreal 286 \nOscillation at 9.9-9.7 ka (Geirsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2000). 287 \nQuoted \u201caverage\u201d rates of deglaciation for Iceland, as used in mantle melting models, are 2 288 \nm a-1 (2 km in 1 ka; Jull and McKenzie 1996, Pagli and Sigmundsson 2008). Similarly, the mean 289 \nrate of surface elevation change of the Laurentide ice sheet during early Holocene deglaciation is 290 \nestimated at 2.6 m a-1 (Carlson et al. 2008). However, it is inappropriate to assume a constant rate of 291 \nice unloading, as phases of dramatic warming, such as the end of the Younger Dryas event, are likely 292 \nto have involved much more rapid recession over shorter time intervals. Indeed, there is geological 293 \nevidence for bursts of considerably faster deglaciation during abrupt warming events (e.g. 100 m a-1 294 \nin Denmark between 18-17 ka, Humlum and Houmark-Nielsen, 1994). Rapid deglaciation in 295 \nvolcanically active areas could be further driven by positive feedback, with eruption-triggered 296 \nj\u00f6kulhlaups potentially playing an important role in glacier break-up (Geirsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2000, 297 \nCarrivick et al. 2009b). 298 \nNonetheless, it is informative to compare data: the current rates are mostly about 20-40 % of 299 \nthe mean estimated deglaciation rates for the Icelandic and Laurentide ice sheets (Fig. 7). The extent 300 \nof ice unloading is, however, very different, as rapid unloading has only occurred since the end of 301 \n15 \n \nthe Little Ice Age. For example, Vatnaj\u00f6kull in Iceland has only shrunk since 1890 (Bj\u00f6rnsson and 302 \nP\u00e1lsson 2008, Pagli and Sigmundsson 2008). This means that total thinning of only ~60 m has 303 \noccurred at Vatnaj\u00f6kull since 1890, compared with ~2 km during the last deglaciation (Fig. 7). 304 \nTropical glaciers in the Andes reached their maximum extents of the last millennium at between 305 \n1630 and 1730 AD (Jomelli et al. 2009) and have only rapidly retreated since the middle of the 19th 306 \ncentury. Therefore current thinning has only been sustained over a 100-200 year period, which is 307 \nconsiderably shorter than major deglaciation events. As a consequence the total reduction in ice 308 \nthickness to date during current warming is probably less than 10 % of that during major past 309 \ndeglaciation events.  310 \nHowever, there are marked local and regional discrepancies in how rapidly ice sheets and 311 \nglaciers have receded during current (post-Little Ice Age) warming. Over 3030 km3 if ice has been 312 \nlost from Glacier Bay, Alaska since 1770 (Larsen et al. 2005), with local thinning of up to 1.5 km at 313 \na mean rate of up to 6.5 m a-1. This value is more comparable to changes during the main phases of 314 \ndeglaciation, but has not occurred in an active volcanic region.  315 \n 316 \n 317 \n5. How might hazards be affected by melting of ice and snow? 318 \n 319 \n5.1. Ice unloading may encourage more explosive eruptions 320 \nThe explosivity of eruptions beneath ice sheets is restrained by thick ice, as high glaciostatic 321 \npressures (>5 MPa) inhibit volatile exsolution (Tuffen et al. 2010) and rapid ice deformation can 322 \nclose cavities melted at the base of the ice, encouraging intrusive rather than explosive activity (Fig. 323 \n8; Tuffen et al. 2007). Thinning of ice covering a volcano may therefore encourage more explosive 324 \n16 \n \neruptions, which generate meltwater more rapidly than intrusive eruptions (Gu\u00f0mundsson 2003) 325 \nand, if the ice surface were breached, create hazards associated with tephra. Where ice is thin (<150 326 \nm) there is generally comparatively little interaction between magma and meltwater, as thin ice 327 \nfractures readily, offers little constraint to the force of eruptions and is inefficient at collecting 328 \nmeltwater around the vent (Smellie and Skilling 1994, Smellie 1999). Thinning of ice may therefore 329 \ngenerally lead to more explosive eruptions at volcanoes that are currently covered by substantial 330 \nthicknesses of ice (>300 m), especially those with deep ice-filled summit calderas such as Sollipulli, 331 \nChile (Gilbert et al. 1996) and Katla, Iceland (Bj\u00f6rnsson et al. 2000). It is important to note, 332 \nhowever, that there is currently no quantitative relationship between eruption explosivity and ice 333 \nthickness. The models quoted only simulate a small part of the coupled volcano-ice system and thus 334 \nare essentially qualitative; they do not incorporate feedbacks between the dynamics of magma 335 \nstorage, ascent and the response of the overlying ice.   336 \n 337 \n5.2. Ice unloading and increased melting may trigger edifice stability 338 \nIt has been hypothesised that melting and recession of ice on volcanic edifices may lead to instability 339 \nand edifice collapse due to two independent mechanisms: firstly, debuttressing and the withdrawal of 340 \nmechanical support from ice (Capra 2008) and secondly, an increase in the pore fluid pressure within 341 \nshallow hydrothermal systems, which may trigger movement on pre-existing weaknesses (Capra 342 \n2008). However, this hypothesis currently remains unproven due to insufficient data. A significant 343 \nproportion of glacier meltwater may enter the hydrothermal system of volcanoes (e.g. Antizana 344 \nvolcano, Ecuador, Favier et al. 2008). Seasonal seismicity at volcanoes such as Mt Hood (USA) is 345 \nconsistent with seismic triggering by an increase in meltwater input (Saar and Manga 2003), 346 \n17 \n \nillustrating that movement on pre-existing weaknesses is favoured by enhanced meltwater 347 \nproduction.  348 \n  349 \n5.3. Melting of ice and snow may decrease the likelihood and magnitude of meltwater floods 350 \nAs the volume of ice and snow on a volcano decreases, the size of the reservoir of potential 351 \nmeltwater decreases. At volcanoes where a relatively small volume of ice and snow is present the 352 \ntotal volume of lahars may be restricted by the volume of ice and snow available for melting 353 \n(Huggel et al. 2007a). This leads to the following qualitative prediction: as this volume decreases the 354 \ntotal volume and magnitude of meltwater floods should decrease for a given size of eruption, thus 355 \nreducing the associated hazards. Bj\u00f6rnsson and P\u00e1lsson (2008) have shown that meltwater discharge 356 \nfrom thinning Icelandic glaciers is likely to peak in 2040-2050 as ablation rates rise, but thereafter 357 \nrecede, reflecting the diminished volume of ice available for melting. Futhermore, as meltwater 358 \nfloods are triggered when tephra falls onto ice and snow (Major and Newhall 1989, Walder 2000, 359 \nJulio-Miranda et al. 2008), a reduction in the area of ice and snow will reduce the probability that 360 \nthis will occur, therefore reducing the incidence of lahar generation. However, if the size of 361 \neruptions were to increase then in some cases a dwindling ice volume would not prevent an increase 362 \nin the magnitude of meltwater floods, as recognised by Huggel et al. (2007a).  363 \n 364 \n6. What are the likely effects of 21st century climate change on hazards at ice-covered 365 \nvolcanoes? 366 \n 367 \nUnloading as ice and snow melt may trigger increased volcanic activity. Vexed questions include 368 \nhow quickly volcanic systems respond to ice thickness changes, which baselines for rates of volcanic 369 \n18 \n \nactivity are appropriate for the Holocene, and how to scale past accelerations in volcanic activity to 370 \nchanges in the 21st century. 371 \n 372 \n6.1. Increased magma production and eruption in Iceland?   373 \nMelting of Icelandic ice sheets leads to increased mantle melting and eruption of magma to the 374 \nsurface (Fig. 5; Jull and McKenzie 1996, Maclennan et al. 2002, Pagli and Sigmundsson 2008). It is 375 \nestimated that melting of Vatnaj\u00f6kull between 1890 and 2003 (435 km3 loss, with a thinning rate of 376 \n~0.5 m a-1) led to a 1 % increase in the rate of magma production (Pagli and Sigmundsson 2008). If 377 \ncurrent melting rates continue throughout the 21st century a roughly similar additional rise in melt 378 \nproduction may be anticipated. Any increase in the thinning rate would trigger a stronger 379 \nacceleration in melt production. It is important to note, however, that the rate and amount of ice 380 \nthinning are far lower than during the last deglaciation (Fig. 7), and the projected increases in the 381 \nrate of melt production are far weaker (at most a few percent increase, as opposed to a 30-50 fold 382 \nincrease). Although studies have shown that additional melt was transported to the surface at a rate 383 \nof over 50 m a-1 (Maclennan et al. 2002), this only constrains the timescale of melt extraction to 384 \nbeing <2 ka.  385 \nThere is incomplete evidence collected to date, but some preliminary data suggests that the 386 \ntiming of Icelandic volcanism during deglaciation may have coincided with rapid warming events, 387 \nindicating a short delay between extra melting and eruption to the surface. The timing of large tuya-388 \nbuilding eruptions in north Iceland appear to correspond with two most marked warming events 389 \nduring deglaciation \u2013 the Bolling warming and the end of the Younger Dryas (Licciardi et al. 2007).  390 \n19 \n \nWe therefore have insufficient knowledge to predict whether the \u201cextra\u201d melt generated 391 \nwould be erupted to the surface in the 21st century and whether any statistically significant increase 392 \nin activity should be anticipated. 393 \n 394 \n6.2. Increased magma production and eruption globally? 395 \nThe pioneering study by Huybers and Langmuir (2009) attempts to relate changes in global volcanic 396 \nactivity during deglaciation to estimates of the rate of ice unloading. In it they use a simple glacier 397 \nmass balance model to estimate modern changes in ice thickness at a number of glaciers. This model 398 \nconsiders only relative accumulation vs ablation rates and ignores the ice dynamical processes (e.g. 399 \nBell 2008, Wingham et al. 2009) and local variations in precipitation and temperature (e.g. Vuille et 400 \nal. 2008) that strongly influence mass balance and ice sheet profiles (e.g. Hubbard 2006). The results 401 \nof eruption datasets are used to calculate glacial\/deglacial and deglacial\/Holocene eruption 402 \nfrequency ratios (Fig. 6a). Volcanoes with a current strong negative ice volume balance are excluded 403 \nfrom the analysis as they are assumed not to have been ice-covered during the late Pleistocene, and 404 \ntherefore insignificant ice unloading is assumed to have occurred during deglaciation. Analysis of 405 \nthe eruption frequency of volcanoes considered to have been ice-covered then produces an 406 \nenhancement in the rate of volcanic activity by a factor of 2 and 6 between 12 and 7 ka. These 407 \nfigures were generated using a -6 m a-1 and a -9 m a-1 cut-off, respectively.  408 \nEstimates of the amount of increased melting and magma eruption to the surface are very 409 \napproximate. Huybers and Langmuir assume that unloading 1 km of ice above a 60 km thick melting 410 \nregion triggers a 0.1% increase in the melt percentage, and that 10 % of the melt then reaches the 411 \nsurface. They then estimate that 15 % of the 1.8 \u00d7 106 km3 of ice lost from mountain glaciers 412 \nbetween the last glacial maximum and today influences magma production. The validity of this 413 \n20 \n \npercentage needs to be checked against the distribution of global ice loss from mountain glaciers, 414 \nwhich is itself very difficult to constrain due to a lack of data and the complexity of local climatic 415 \nvariations (e.g. Vuille et al. 2008). The melting model also ignores diversity in melt zone depths and 416 \ndoes not take in account crustal storage in magma chambers.  417 \n Elsewhere, Jellinek et al. (2004) examine statistical correlations between changes in ice 418 \nthickness (assumed to be related to the time derivative of the SPECMAP \u03b418O record) and the 419 \nfrequency (rather than magnitude) of documented volcanic eruptions in Eastern California (Fig. 6b). 420 \nThey found a significant correlation, with increased frequency of volcanism following periods of 421 \ninferred glacier unloading. Models indicated a delay between unloading and increased volcanism of 422 \n3.2 \u00b1 4.2 kyr and 11.2 \u00b1 2.3 ka for silicic and basaltic eruptions respectively. Although local ice 423 \nthickness fluctuations are unlikely to relate consistently or linearly to the oxygen isotope record, this 424 \nanalysis does point to intriguing differences between the rate of response to unloading between 425 \ndifferent magma types and volcanic plumbing systems. Similarly, Nowell et al. (2006) found 426 \nevidence for accelerated volcanism during deglaciation of western Europe. 427 \n These studies indicate that a statistically significant correlation exists between unloading of 428 \nice and increased volcanism. However, as is the case for Iceland, the timescale of the response of 429 \nvolcanic systems to ice unloading is not well constrained. Data from Eastern California suggest that 430 \nthe volcanic response may be delayed by thousands of years. If this were the case, volcanism in the 431 \ncoming century may reflect changing ice thicknesses in the mid-to-late Holocene, rather than 432 \nmelting of ice since the Little Ice Age. Scaling issues are also problematic. There is considerable 433 \nuncertainty about how the magnitude of acceleration in melt production and magma eruption to the 434 \nsurface scale to the amount and rate of ice unloading. A simple linear relationship between melt 435 \nproduction and unloading (e.g. Huybers and Langmuir 2009) is not appropriate as the rate of melt 436 \n21 \n \nproduction also depends on the previous loading and unloading history (Jull and McKenzie 1996). 437 \nFurthermore, magma residence in chambers may decouple the timing of melt production from that of 438 \nmagma eruption to the surface. 439 \n 440 \n6.3. Potential effects on volcanic hazards 441 \nAn increase in the rate of magma eruption to the surface would entail larger and\/or more frequent 442 \neruptions, thus increasing exposure to hazards. Indeed, analysis of tephra in the Greenland ice core 443 \n(Zielinski et al. 1996) has shown that the greatest frequency of volcanic events in the last 110 ka 444 \noccurred between 15 and 8 ka, closely corresponding to the timing of northern hemisphere 445 \ndeglaciation. The largest eruptions also occurred during a similar, overlapping interval, between 13 446 \nand 7 ka. To date most studies have focussed solely on the frequency of eruptions (e.g. Jellinek et al. 447 \n2004, Nowell et al. 2006, Huybers and Langmuir 2009). Increased eruptive frequency at a given 448 \nvolcano will increase risk exposure. The intensity and explosivity index (VEI) of eruptions also scale 449 \nto their total volume (e.g. Newhall and Self 1982, Pyle 1999). There is currently insufficient 450 \nevidence to determine whether the size or frequency of eruptions will increase in the 21st century. 451 \nThe explosivity of eruptions beneath ice is expected to generally increase as the ice thins 452 \n(Fig. 8; Tuffen et al. 2007). Therefore, where ice is over 150 m in thickness and thinning of more 453 \nthan 100 m occurs, the probability of more hazardous explosive eruptions will increase. This will be 454 \nmost relevant to volcanoes with deep ice-covered calderas such as Sollipulli, Chile (Gilbert et al. 455 \n1996). However, it is not currently possible to quantify the increased probability of explosive 456 \neruptions and whether it is significant. 457 \nThere is stronger evidence that current ice recession may considerably increase hazards 458 \nrelated to edifice instability. Capra (2008) has proposed that that the incidence of major volcano 459 \n22 \n \ncollapses is strongly affected by ice recession during deglaciation. Huggel et al. (2008) have noted 460 \nan upturn in the rate of large-volume avalanches, which corresponds with and is attributed to recent 461 \nclimate change. Similar predictions are made for mountain instabilities due to recession of alpine 462 \nglaciers (Keiler et al., this volume). Melting and unloading of ice may have a much more rapid effect 463 \non edifice stability than on melt production and eruption. Modelling by Huggel (2009) shows that 464 \nthe thermal perturbations that may destabilize slopes are likely to occur over tens or hundreds of 465 \nyears (for conductive heat flow processes) and years to decades (for advective\/convective heat flow 466 \nprocesses). Perturbations triggered by volcanic activity may be effective over much shorter time 467 \nscales.  468 \nAndean stratovolcanoes that host rapidly-diminishing tropical glaciers are likely to be 469 \nparticularly sensitive to climate warming. Many glaciers are completely out of equilibrium with 470 \ncurrent climate and may completely disappear within decades (Vuille et al. 2008). Model projections 471 \nof future climate change in the tropical Andes indicate a continued warming of the tropical 472 \ntroposphere throughout the 21st century, with a temperature increase that is enhanced at higher 473 \nelevations. By the end of the 21st century, following the SRES A2 emission scenario, the tropical 474 \nAndes may experience a massive warming on the order of 4.5\u20135 \u00b0C (Vuille et al. 2008). This 475 \nwarming will drive edifice instability both by removing ice, increasing the amount of meltwater at 476 \nhigh elevations on edifices and thawing ice-bedrock contacts, encouraging slippage.  477 \nClimate warming may in some incidences reduce lahar hazards, as the disappearance of small 478 \nvolumes of snow and ice from volcanoes such as Popocatepetl will reduce the volume of ice 479 \navailable for meltwater flood generation. Dwindling areas of ice and snow will also reduce the 480 \nprobability of lahar generation. This reduction in lahar hazards may only be notable in volcanoes 481 \nundergoing almost complete glacier extinction (Huggel et al. 2007a).  482 \n23 \n \n 483 \n7. Gaps in our knowledge and targets for future research 484 \n 485 \nImportant gaps in our knowledge of links between melting of ice and volcanic hazards remain, 486 \nwhich include: 487 \n 488 \n 1) Uncertainty about the timescale of volcanic responses to ice unloading. We currently have only 489 \nlimited insight into the reasons for delayed volcanic responses (Maclennan et al. 2002) and the 490 \ntimescales involved (Jellinek et al. 2004); response times are likely to differ in different tectonic 491 \nsettings. 492 \n2) Poor constraint on how ice bodies on volcanoes will respond to 21st century climate change. 493 \nThe highly localised effects of topography, microclimates and local geothermal and eruption-related 494 \nprocesses on volcanoes conspire to create considerable diversity in the response of individual 495 \nglaciers and ice sheets to climate change (e.g. Geirsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2006, Rivera et al. 2006, Bown and 496 \nRivera 2007, Brock et al. 2007).  497 \n3) The sensitivity of volcanoes to small changes in ice thickness or to recession of small glaciers on 498 \ntheir flanks is unknown. Although there is strong evidence that wholesale ice removal during 499 \ndeglaciation can significant accelerate volcanic activity there is considerable uncertainty about how 500 \nvolcanic responses to unloading scale with the magnitude, rate and distribution of ice unloading. A 501 \nsimple linear relationship between the rates of ice melting and additional melt production is unlikely 502 \nto be appropriate. The effects of recession of different scales of ice body need to be considered, from 503 \nthe largest ice sheets to the smallest summit glaciers. 504 \n4) Lack of data on how past changes in ice thickness have affected the style of volcanic eruptions 505 \nand associated hazards. Most statistical studies of the effects of ice thickness changes on volcanism 506 \n24 \n \nhave focussed exclusively on the frequency of eruptions. It would be of great interest to know 507 \nwhether the sizes of eruptions or the probability of large caldera-forming events increase during 508 \nperiods of ice recession.  509 \n5) It is not known how localised ice withdrawal from stratovolcanoes will affect shallow crustal 510 \nmagma storage and eruption. Existing models for how loading by ice affects volcanism have 511 \nfocussed on large (>50 km diameter), near-horizontal ice sheets and mantle melting (e.g. Jull and 512 \nMcKenzie 1996, Pagli and Sigmundsson 2008). Stratovolcanoes, which constitute the vast majority 513 \nof ice- and snow-covered volcanoes worldwide, are entirely different systems, being characterised 514 \nby smaller, thinner ice bodies and the existence of crustal magma chambers.  515 \n6) Broader feedbacks between volcanism and climate change remain poorly understood. 516 \nA number of potential positive feedbacks during volcano-ice interactions exist, which could 517 \npotentially greatly magnify the rate of ice recession and effects on volcanic activity. Feedbacks 518 \ninclude the increased CO2 emissions from accelerated volcanism during ice unloading, which may 519 \nact to further warm the climate (Huybers and Langmuir 2009). Enhanced basal melting may 520 \ndestabilise ice sheets, leading to more rapid ice recession (Bell 2008). More locally, tephra covering 521 \nthe ice surface may affect the mass balance of glaciers (Rivera et al. 2006, Brock et al. 2007). 522 \nCurrently little is known about the effects of these feedbacks and whether they will play an 523 \nimportant role in the 21st century and beyond. 524 \n 525 \nFuture work required 526 \n 527 \nIn order to resolve these problems both new data and improved models are required. Existing 528 \ndatabases of known volcanic eruptions need to be augmented by numerous detailed case studies of 529 \n25 \n \nthe Quaternary eruptive history of ice-covered volcanoes, especially in the Andes, to determine 530 \nwhether the frequency and size of their eruptions has been influenced by past changes in ice 531 \nthickness. The volcanic response should be examined to both large-magnitude, long timescale 532 \nclimatic changes such as glacial-interglacial cycles and to smaller, briefer fluctuations in the last 533 \nmillennium such as the Little Ice Age. This will reveal the sensitivity and response time of volcanic 534 \nsystems to a range of forcing timescales and magnitudes. 535 \nThe unique record of palaeo-ice thicknesses provided by subglacially erupted volcanic 536 \ndeposits (e.g. Mee et al. 2006, Licciardi et al. 2007, Smellie et al. 2008, Tuffen et al. 2010) must be 537 \nexploited in order to precisely reconstruct fluctuating local ice thicknesses on volcanic edifices. In 538 \ntandem high resolution dating techniques will be required, which stretch the limits of existing 539 \nradiometric methods. Geochemical indicators of the residence time of magma in shallow magma 540 \nchambers could reveal whether shallow magma storage is affected by ice thickness variations.   541 \nImproved physical models are required to test how magma generation, storage and eruption 542 \nat stratovolcanoes is affected by stress perturbations related to the waxing and waning of small-543 \nvolume ice bodies on what is commonly steep topography. Finally, feedbacks between the mass 544 \nbalance of ice sheets and glaciers and volcanic activity need to be incorporated into future Earth 545 \nSystem Models.  546 \n 547 \nAcknowledgements 548 \nHT was supported by a NERC Research Fellowship [NE\/E013740\/1] and a NERC New Investigator 549 \nGrant [NE\/G000654\/1].

The melting rate is the 861 \nvolume of melt produced from each unit volume of mantle per kyr. (b) Modelled rate of melt 862 \nproduction with a \u201cspike\u201d between 12 and 11 ka. 863 \n 864 \nFigure 6. a) The ratio of postglacial (18-7 ka) to glacial (40-20 ka) activity at volcanoes worldwide 865 \nplotted against a proxy for the amount of ice unloading from ice mass balance models (Huybers and 866 \nLangmuir 2009). Regions with a less negative ice volume balance are those that are most likely to 867 \nhave been glaciated, and thus have experienced significant unloading of ice during the last 868 \ndeglaciation. It is at these regions that the strongest acceleration in the rate of eruptions has occurred, 869 \nsuggesting a causal link between unloading of ice and enhanced volcanic activity. b) Data from 870 \nJellinek et al. (2004) showing the SPECMAP \u03b418O curve (a proxy for global ice volume) and the 871 \ntime series of eruptions in the Long Valley and Owens Valley volcanic fields, California. This data 872 \nis used to show statistically significant correlation between ice unloading and accelerated volcanism. 873 \n 874 \nFigure 7. Some approximate rates and amounts of ice thinning since the Little Ice Age and during 875 \ndeglaciation, together with projections for the 21st century using current rates of ice melting. Note 876 \nthat total thinning may in many cases be limited by the complete extinction of ice (e.g. Popocatepetl, 877 \nJulio-Miranda et al. 2008).  878 \n 879 \nFigure 8. Results of modelling of rhyolitic eruptions under ice from a 1.5 km-long fissure. The 880 \nevolution of subglacial cavities during melting and ice deformation is simulated and the combination 881 \nof ice thickness and magma discharge rate likely to lead to explosive and intrusive eruptions is 882 \n38 \n \nindicated. Explosive eruptions (above the line) are favoured by thin ice and high magma discharge 883 \nrates. They are more hazardous than intrusion eruptions since meltwater is produced far more 884 \nquickly (Gu\u00f0mundsson 2003) and eruptions may pierce the ice surface, producing tephra hazards. 885 \nModified from Tuffen et al.
