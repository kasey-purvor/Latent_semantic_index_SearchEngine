Introduction\nInfrared emitting laser diodes (LDs) have a growing number of applications. In prac-\ntice, lasing is normally induced by coherent energy sources e.g. optical pumping by\ncoherent radiation or by an electrical current, with the latter being either constant\nor pulsed [1\u20134]. It is well known that noise is inevitably present in all semiconduct-\ning devices, including lasers, and it is widely acknowledged that it normally plays a\nnegative role. In addition to thermal fluctuations, random fluctuations in the pump\nalso contribute to the noise. They usually lead to a deterioration of the laser: the\nintensity of the radiation decreases and the peak in the spectrum broadens. For\nthese reasons, the idea of utilizing noise in a semiconductor device to produce any\nkind of positive effect appears at first sight totally unrealistic.\nIn this Letter we report, however, that external noise can play a constructive role\nin a laser diode, causing effects that are both nontrivial and counter-intuitive. We\nfind that the device is able to transform the energy of the random pump fluctuations\ninto coherent mid-infrared radiation. Noise-induced lasing can be either single- or\nmulti-mode, each mode attaining its maximum coherence at an optimal noise level.\nThe results reported allow one to reconsider the role of random fluctuations in\nsemiconductors, and might lead to a new direction in their study.\nPublished in Fluct.

Semiconducter Diode Under Study\nThe semiconductor laser chosen for our investigation consists of a double het-\nerostructure (DH), which provides an optical waveguide, an active region, and two\nelectrical contacts. We used an LD fabricated from III-V double heterostructures\n(DHs) grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). A conventional horizontal, multi-well\ngraphite sliding boat was used for the LPE growth of the LD structures onto p-\ntype InAs (100) substrates with a carrier concentration of 1018 cm\u22123 obtained\nfrom Wafer Technology Ltd. The resulting epitaxial structure, which has been\ndescribed in detail elsewhere [5], was a DH in which the unintentionally doped n-\nInAs0.94Sb0.06 active layer is enclosed between P\u2013 and N\u2013InAs0.42Sb0.18P0.40 con-\nfinement layers. The P content in the confinement layers was 0.40 (Eg = 620meV)\nto provide high bandgap energy and large interface band offsets for good carrier\nconfinement. The InAs0.94Sb0.06 active region was 0.7 \u00b5m thick (Eg = 350 meV),\nand the InAs0.42Sb0.18P0.40 layers, each being 3.0 \u00b5m in thickness. Residual carrier\nconcentration in the active layer was reduced to 1016 cm\u22123. The cladding layers\nwere intentionally doped with Sn up to a concentration of 5 \u00b7 1018 cm\u22123 and with\nZn up to 1018cm\u22123 for N\u2013 and P\u2013sides, respectively. The LDs were fabricated\nfrom the epitaxial wafers using standard procedures. Ohmic contacts were formed\nby thermal evaporation of Au:Zn and Au:Te alloys on the p\u2013 and n\u2013sides of the\nstructures, respectively. Double-channel mesa-stripe laser chips with a b = 12\u00b5m\nstripe width were then processed using photolithography. Laser diodes were cleaved\nwith a Fabry-Perot cavity length (L) of 300\u00b5m. The LD chips were then mounted\np\u2013side up onto TO-49 headers for testing. The laser was placed in a metal dewar\nand cooled to 77 K.

The electroluminescence was detected using a cooled (77K) InSb photodiode\ndetector and Stanford Research (SR850) digital phase-sensitive detector. Normally,\npumping the laser with conventional rectangular pulses of current of amplitude\nabove the generation threshold 29 mA (at a repetition frequency of 10 kHz), results\nin single-mode laser emission at 3.3 \u00b5m.\n3. Experimental Results and Discussion\nIn our experiments, instead of the usual pumping in the form of a sequence of\nunipolar pulses, a random signal with zero mean was applied, having a Gaussian\ndistribution and spectral bandwidth > 100 kHz [6]. Figure 1 shows the spectral\nstructure of the electroluminescence for different values of noise current. For a root\nmean square (rms) noise current of 4.1 mA only spontaneous emission was observed\n(Fig. 1(a)). However, with further increase of the noise intensity, a remarkable\nspectral narrowing took place (Fig. 1(b)), quite contrary to the traditional ex-\npectation. This narrowing was accompanied by a substantial increase of optical\nemission power and thus can be considered as the beginning of laser emission. Fur-\nther increase of noise intensity led to the growth of radiation intensity. Above 4.5\nmA, two additional modes appeared sequentially in the optical emission (Fig. 1(c)).\nAs the noise intensity was increased, the spectral peak associated with each partic-\nular mode grew to reach its maximum height and minimum width at a (different)\noptimal noise level.\nWith further increase of noise, the peaks\u2019 heights decreased while their widths\ngrew monotonically. The lasing modes were gradually destroyed, starting with that\nof smallest wavelength (Fig. 1(d)). In Fig. 2(a,b) the dependences of height (a)\nand width (b) on noise intensity for the three most pronounced modes are shown. It\nis clearly seen that, for all peaks considered, these dependences are nonmonotonic,\ni.e. the coherence of the radiation is changed by variation of the noise intensity. To\nestimate the coherence of each radiation mode, we use a parameter that can serve\nas an analogue of the signal-to-noise ratio [7\u201311] widely used in oscillation theory to\ndescribe spectral broadening due to noise: coherence = height\u00d7wavelength\/width.\nHere, \u201cheight\u201d is the height of the peak, \u201cwidth\u201d is its width at the half-height,\nand \u201cwavelength\u201d is its centre wavelength. Fig. 2(c) shows the coherence of each\nlasing mode as a function of the rms noise current. The optimal noise intensity,\nproviding the maximum coherence of the noise-induced radiation mode, is unique\nfor each peak. Thus, by choosing different noise intensities, one is able to suppress\nor enhance the coherence of a selected mode. It is interesting to note that, by\nexciting particular modes, the noise in our laser diode effectively reveals the inner\nstructure of the quantum energy levels, thus constituting another example of the\ncreative role of noise.\nThe observed effects can be accounted for in terms of nonlinear dynamics. The\nlaser can be viewed as a threshold device that starts to generate a periodic signal\nwhen the input signal exceeds this threshold, i.e. it is an excitable system. Thus, if\nnoise is applied to it, signal generation will occur and disappear at random times\n[12]. When the noise is weak, the fraction of the observation time when oscillations\noccur is small, and the spectrum of the total signal at the output is broadband\ncontinuous with small energy. As the noise becomes stronger, oscillatory modes\nare excited more frequently, the output energy grows and the spectrum narrows.\nIt is clear, however, that for very large noise the oscillations in the device will\nbecome very irregular again. In between, there must exist some optimal noise\nintensity for which the total output of the system is maximally coherent. Thus, the\neffects observed in this work can be accounted for in terms of the recently identified\ncoherence resonance phenomenon [13, 14]. Its characteristic signature is a bell-\nshaped dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio or equivalent characteristic on the\nnoise intensity. However, the effects observed here, although similar, are actually\nmore complex. In our case, coherence resonance occurs separately for each mode of\noptical emission, i.e. each mode acquires its maximum coherence at a different noise\nintensity. It therefore seems appropriate to call the phenomenon multiple coherence\nresonance.\n4. Conclusions\nWe have shown that pumping by noise alone is able to induce multimode lasing\nin a semiconducter diode. The spectral characteristics of this lasing exhibit an\ninteresting dependence on noise intensity. For each mode there are certain values\nof noise intensity at which the corresponding spectral peak has maximal height\nand minimal width, indicative of noise-induced ordering. In fact, variation of the\napplied noise intensity allows one to control the coherence of a particular mode. This\nproperty looks promising for application to problems in e.g. telecommunications.\nThe observed phenomena appear to be closely related to coherence resonance.\nThe results obtained compel us to take a new view of the role of noise in semicon-\nductors, and probably provide a way to utilize noise energy for laser radiation.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research has been supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil (UK) and by the Leverhulme Trust (UK).\nReferences\n[1] E H.
