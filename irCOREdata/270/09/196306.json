A knowl-\nedge of this quantity is essential for understanding solid-\nliquid phase transitions, including the processes of nu-\ncleation and crystal growth [1]. In a supercooled liquid,\n\u03b3sl counteracts the effects of the free energy difference\nbetween solid and liquid phases, and hence determines\nthe size of the critical nucleus. The anisotropy of \u03b3sl,\ni.e., its dependence on the orientation of the interface\nwith respect to the crystal lattice, influences the shape of\nthe crystal and the morphology of dendritic growth [2].\nClearly, being able to accurately determine \u03b3sl and its\nanisotropy is of considerable fundamental and technolog-\nical interest.\nRecently, there has been much progress in the de-\nvelopment of methodology for determining \u03b3sl and its\nanisotropy by means of molecular simulation. Two\ndistinct but complementary methods have been devel-\noped: the cleaving method, introduced by Broughton and\nGilmer [3] and subsequently enhanced by Davidchack and\nLaird [4\u20136], and the capillary fluctuation method (CFM)\nproposed by Hoyt, Asta, and Karma [7]. The cleaving\nmethod uses external potentials to reversibly transform\ntwo separate solid and liquid systems prepared at coexis-\ntence conditions into a single system with the two phases\njuxtaposed to create an interface. The value of \u03b3sl is\nobtained directly by measuring the work performed by\nthe external potentials during the transformation pro-\ncess. The main technical difficulty with this method is\nthat it involves several stages, each of which requires\nprecise control to ensure the transformation proceeds re-\nversibly. The implementation of CFM is more straight-\nforward, since it only requires the simulation of an equili-\nbrated interfacial system. However, in this case the value\nof \u03b3sl is obtained indirectly, relying on the validity of the\nrelationship between the magnitude of the capillary fluc-\ntuations and the stiffness of the interface, which, in turn,\nis related to \u03b3sl through a functional dependence with a\ncarefully chosen set of anisotropy parameters. The cleav-\ning method is more precise in determining specific values\nof \u03b3sl, while the CFM is more sensitive for ascertaining\nthe anisotropy.\nIt is notable that all systems studied to date have been\natomic, with the exception of succinonitrile (SCN) [8] and\na hard-dumbbell system [9]. However, both of these sys-\ntems are amenable to current methods, since SCN freezes\ninto an orientationally disordered bcc crystal and hence\nbehaves essentially as atomic, while the cleaving walls\napproach, developed originally for the hard-sphere sys-\ntem [4], is directly applicable to the hard-dumbbell sys-\ntem.\nWe report here a significant extension of the cleaving\nmethod that enables the direct calculation of the solid-\nliquid interfacial free energy for molecular systems. The\nmain challenge is to incorporate the orientational degrees\nof freedom into the transformation path, so that, in the\nprocess of forming the interface, the liquid molecules oc-\ncupy crystal sites with appropriate orientational order.\nWe solve this problem by designing a cleaving poten-\ntial that influences both position and orientation of the\nmolecules. The proposed potential is generic and can be\napplied to all types of rigid molecules, as well as being\nadaptable to flexible molecular systems. We use the ex-\ntended cleaving method to determine the free energy of\nthe interface between ice Ih and water at ambient pres-\nsure for the TIP4P model of water. Even though the ice\nIh structure consists of orientationally disordered hydro-\ngen bonds, the orientation of molecules during the cleav-\ning process needs to be controlled in order for the crystal\nstructure to obey the Bernall-Fowler ice rules [10].\nThe cleaving method.\u2014 The method consists of four\n2basic steps: Step 1: Cleave the solid system with a suit-\nably chosen external potential (the cleaving potential)\nalong a plane (the cleaving plane) between two crystal\nlayers of a given orientation; Step 2: Cleave the liquid\nsystem with a matching potential, which induces partial\nordering of the liquid near the cleaving plane, and creates\na barrier through which the liquid particles cannot cross;\nStep 3: Merge the two systems by gradually rearrang-\ning the boundary conditions to allow interaction between\nthe solid and the liquid across the cleaving planes while\nmaintaining the cleaving potential; Step 4: Remove the\ncleaving potential from the combined system.\nProvided the initial isolated solid and liquid systems\nhave been equilibrated at the solid-liquid coexistence con-\nditions, the only result of the above transformation pro-\ncess is the creation of the solid-liquid interface. There-\nfore, the total work performed on the system constitutes\nthe product of the interfacial free energy \u03b3sl and the area\nof the created interface.\nThe reversible work in each step is determined using a\nstandard coupling parameter approach [11] wherein the\ntotal potential energy of the system depends on the cou-\npling parameter \u03bb, i.e. U = U(\u03bb), in such a way that\nchanging the parameter value (typically from \u03bb = 0 to\n\u03bb = 1) transforms the system from its initial to its final\nstate. In the present study we have opted to compute\nthe reversible work in each of the four steps using the\nnonequilibrium work approach in the spirit of the Ben-\nnett acceptance ratio (BAR) method [12\u201316]. Within\nthis approach, the coupling parameter \u03bb is changed con-\ntinuously from its initial to its final value over the du-\nration of the simulation run (or, if one were employing\nthe Monte Carlo method, over a number of sweeps) [17].\nCompared to the more traditional thermodynamic inte-\ngration approach, the nonequilibrium BAR method ap-\npears to be more efficient and, even more significantly,\nprovides a highly reliable estimate of the error on the\ndetermined free energy [15].\nThe cleaving potential.\u2014The cleaving potential is in-\ntroduced to prevent the particles from crossing the\ncleaving plane (otherwise the process of rearranging the\nboundary conditions in Step 3 is not well defined). A\nsuitable choice of cleaving potential is crucial to the suc-\ncess of the method, since accurate results can only be\nobtained if the transformation path is near-reversible on\nthe time scale of the simulation. Both requirements can\nbe satisfied if the cleaving potential is designed to pro-\nmote the formation of crystal layers at the cleaving plane\nin Step 2. In the previous implementations of the cleav-\ning method, the cleaving potential has been purely repul-\nsive, tailored to mimic the interaction of liquid particles\nwith layers of crystal particles at the interface. Such a\nrepulsive cleaving potential cannot be directly applied to\nsystems where attractive forces (e.g. electrostatic inter-\nactions) play an essential role in determining the crystal\nstructure. The task of designing the cleaving potential\nfor molecular systems is further complicated by the need\nto induce specific orientations of the molecules within the\ncrystal structure.\nWe construct the cleaving potential from a set of po-\ntential wells located at the ideal crystal positions near\nthe cleaving plane. These wells attract the molecules in\nthe liquid to the lattice sites and orientate them in a\nprescribed way to promote the formation of crystal lay-\ners. For a rigid molecule with center-of-mass coordinates\nr and orientational coordinates q (e.g. rotation matrix,\nEuler angles, or quaternions), the proposed cleaving po-\ntential has the following generic form:\n\u03a6(r,q) =\n\u2211\nj\n\u03c6(|r\u2212Rj |)\u03b8(q,Qj) , (1)\nwhere Rj is the position of the potential well j and Qj\nis the desired orientation of a molecule within the well.\nTypically, \u03c6(r) can be any potential well function with\na minimum (negative) value \u2212dw (the \u201cwell depth\u201d) at\nr = 0 and a finite range rw, i.e., \u03c6(r \u2265 rw) = 0. In this\nwork we employed a simple polynomial function: \u03c6(r) =\ndw[(r\/rw)2 \u2212 1]3 for r < rw.\nTo induce the desired orientation, \u03b8(q,Q) should be\na smooth function which is positive when a molecule is\naligned with the desired orientation (i.e., q is close to\nQ) and negative when the molecule is misaligned. The\noverall result is a potential which attracts molecules with\ngood alignment, and repels those with bad alignment,\nand furthermore exerts a torque on the molecules in the\ndirection of perfect alignment.\nApplication to TIP4P water.\u2014We have applied the\ncleaving method with the proposed molecular cleaving\npotential to the TIP4P model of water [18] and com-\nputed ice Ih\u2013water interfacial free energy for the {0001}\n(basal), {11\u00af00} (prism), and {112\u00af0} interfaces. Both the\nLennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions were trun-\ncated (discontinuously) at 10 A\u02da. We employed molecu-\nlar dynamics simulation in the NV T ensemble using a\nquaternion-based algorithm NO SQUISH [19] with 2 fs\ntime step. The temperature was controlled using the\nNose\u00b4-Hoover method, with separate control of transla-\ntional and rotational motions. In order to determine the\ncoexistence conditions for this water model, trial equili-\nbration runs of the ice Ih\u2013water interface systems were\nperformed at different temperatures [20]. We found the\nrun at 219K to be closest to coexistence, exhibiting no\noverall freezing or melting over a 4 ns simulation run.\nThis temperature is lower than the 232K melting tem-\nperature of TIP4P water reported in [21], and the 229K\nreported in [22] and [23]. This discrepancy is the re-\nsult of differences in the handling of electrostatic inter-\nactions: [21] used Ewald sums, while [22] and [23] used a\ncutoff of 17 A\u02da, compared to our 10 A\u02da. Further details of\nthe methodology employed by us to ascertain the melt-\ning temperature for our system can be found in [17].\nThe coexistence densities of 938.0 kg\/m3 for ice Ih and\n1010.8 kg\/m3 for water were found to yield the approxi-\nmate ambient pressure of 1 bar at 219K.\n3Separate equilibrium ice and water systems were\nprepared at the coexistence conditions. The proton-\ndisordered structure of ice Ih was generated using the\nalgorithm of Buch et al. [24]. The ice system contained\napprox. 2 100 molecules in a simulation cell of dimensions\nLx \u2248 44 A\u02da, Ly \u2248 39 A\u02da, Lz \u2248 45 A\u02da. The water system with\nexactly the same Lx and Ly dimensions (the cleaving\nplane is chosen normal to the z-axis) had approx. 2 400\nmolecules and Lz \u2248 42A\u02da.\nThe orientational part of the cleaving potential in\nEq. (1) took the form:\n\u03b8(q,Q) = n(q) \u00b7 n(Q) (2)\nwhere, n is a unit vector directed from the oxygen to\nthe mid-point of the hydrogens. Note that the torque\ninduced by \u03b8 only influences two of the three rotational\ndegrees of freedom; our studies confirm that this is suf-\nficient inducement for the molecule to find its correct\norientation.\nIn the cleaving step for ice (Step 1), two layers of po-\ntential wells are introduced at the ideal crystal positions\non either side of the cleaving plane, with orientations Q\naligned with the orientations of the crystal molecules at\nthe wells.\nThe potential for cleaving the liquid (Step 2) is iden-\ntical to the potential for cleaving the solid. As noted\nin previous studies [5, 6], the structural ordering of the\nliquid induced by the cleaving potential is the principal\nsource of irreversibility in the cleaving method. For the\nTIP4P water system, the hysteresis was found to be very\npersistent and could not be removed by slowing down the\nswitching process, but could be reduced significantly by\ncleaving at a higher temperature. So cleaving the liquid\nbecomes a 3-stage process: (1) heat the system, (2) cleave\nthe heated system, (3) re-cool the system. We found it\nsufficient to heat the system to about 310K. Instead of\nadjusting the simulation temperature, we adopted the\nequivalent approach of scaling down the potential [25].\nThe scaling work is then calculated in a similar way to\nthe cleaving work. The amount of hysteresis is reliably\nquantified by the nonequilibrium BAR measurement ap-\nproach, since the presence of hysteresis in the switching\nprocess gives rise to a substantial increase in the BAR\nerror estimator. See [17] for details. An illustration of\nthe cleaved liquid system is shown in Figure 1, where the\ncleaving potential has induced the formation of a layer of\nice Ih crystal for the basal orientation of the interface.\nTo merge the two systems (Step 3), the combined po-\ntential U is controlled by a coupling parameter \u03bb as fol-\nlows: U(\u03bb) = (1\u2212 \u03bb)(Ui +Uw) + \u03bbUiw, where Ui and Uw\nare the molecular interaction potentials of separate ice\nand water systems and Uiw is the potential of the com-\nbined system. Finally, the cleaving potential is removed\nfrom the combined ice\u2013water system (Step 4).\nThe interfacial free energy is given by the sum of the\nwork performed in each of Steps 1\u20134 divided by the\narea of the created interface, A = 2LxLy. The com-\nputed values of the ice Ih\u2013water interfacial free energy for\nFIG. 1: (Color online) TIP4P water system at the end of\nStep 2 (basal interface). Arrows indicate the location of the\ncleaving plane.\nTIP4P were 23.3\u00b1 0.8mJm\u22122 for the basal face, 23.6\u00b1\n1.0mJm\u22122 for the prism face, and 24.7\u00b1 0.8mJm\u22122 for\nthe {112\u00af0} face of ice Ih.\nDiscussion.\u2014Because of its importance, there have\nbeen numerous attempts to determine the interfacial free\nenergy of the ice\u2013water interface by experiment using\na variety of methods (see Ref. [26] for a review of ex-\nperimental results). Even though the scatter in these\nresults exceeds 50%, the more recent estimates [26, 27]\ntend to converge to the value 29.1\u00b10.8mJm\u22122 obtained\nby Hardy using the shape of the grain boundary groove\nmethod [28]. So far, the computer simulation results\nfor \u03b3sl for ice\u2013water interface have been obtained only\nby indirect methods: Haymet, Bryk, and Smith [29] de-\ntermined the interfacial tension along the basal face for\nthe SPC\/E model to be 39 \u00b1 4mJm\u22122and argued that\nthe difference between the tension and the free energy of\nthe ice\u2013water interface should be small [38]. In a recent\nstudy, Wang, Tang and Zeng [30] used the superheating-\nundercooling hysteresis method [27] to determine \u03b3sl for\nTIP4P-Ew and TIP5P-Ew models and obtained values\nof 37\u00b1 3mJm\u22122and 42\u00b1 4mJm\u22122, respectively.\nCalculation of the Turnbull coefficient [31], CT , reveals\nthat the lower than experimental \u03b3sl values we obtained\ncould be attributed to the low enthalpy of fusion, \u2206Hfus,\nof the water model employed in our study. The Turn-\nbull coefficient, defined by \u03b3sl\u03c1\n\u22122\/3\ns = CT\u2206Hfus, where\n\u03c1s is the number density of the solid phase, commonly\ntakes a value of about 0.45 for metals, and 0.32 for\nmany non-metallic materials. Since for our water model\n\u2206Hfus = 3.18 kJmol\u22121, whilst for real water \u2206Hfus =\n6.02 kJmol\u22121, our Turnbull coefficient, CT = 0.45, is\nsubstantially higher than that of real water, CT = 0.30.\nThe low value of \u2206Hfus is partially the result of trunca-\ntion of the electrostatic interactions in our model, since\nTIP4P with full electrostatic interactions has an enthalpy\nof fusion \u2206Hfus = 4.39 kJmol\u22121 at its coexistence tem-\nperature of 232K [21]. Since CT is typically insensitive\nto the details of the interaction potential, we expect that\nfor TIP4P with full electrostatics the ice\u2013water interfa-\ncial free energy will be higher. The discrepancy for CT\n4between TIP4P and real water might indicate a limita-\ntion of this model in describing freezing. It remains to\nbe investigated whether inclusion of full electrostatic in-\nteractions will reduce this discrepancy.\nThe dependence of \u03b3sl on the crystal face at the inter-\nface remains poorly characterised. Experimentally, the\nratios could be estimated from the equilibrium shape\nof an ice Ih crystal using the well known Wulff con-\nstruction [32] but, to our knowledge, the equilibrium\nshapes of isolated ice crystals have never been defini-\ntively observed [33]. The experimental observation of the\noblate ellipsoidal shape of water inclusions in ice Ih [34]\nwould imply a very large ratio \u03b3prism\/\u03b3basal = 1.857,\nbut this could also be attributed to the strong influ-\nence of mechanical stresses on the shape of the inclu-\nsions [35]. According to a rough estimate based on the\nnumber of broken bonds at the crystal surface [36, 37]\n\u03b3basal : \u03b3prism : \u03b3{112\u00af0} \u2248 1 : 1.06 : 1.22. Our results are\nconsistent with this estimate in that the value for \u03b3{112\u00af0}\nis higher than the values for the other two interfaces,\nwhich are marginally smaller but very similar. The simi-\nlarity between the calculated interfacial free energies for\ndifferent crystallographic planes implies a minimal role\nof thermodynamic factors in determining the anisotropic\nbehaviour observed during ice nucleation.\nConclusion.\u2014We have extended the cleaving method\nto molecular systems and determined the TIP4P ice Ih\u2013\nwater interfacial free energy for the basal, prism, and\n{112\u00af0} orientations to be 23.3 \u00b1 0.8mJm\u22122, 23.6 \u00b1\n1.0mJm\u22122, and 24.7 \u00b1 0.8mJm\u22122, respectively. In our\nfuture work, we will investigate the influence of electro-\nstatic potential truncation on \u03b3sl and CT by including\nfull electrostatic interactions (e.g., via Ewald sums) in\nour calculations. We will also compute \u03b3sl for other mod-\nels of water and other ice phases, as well as extend the\ncleaving method to flexible molecular model potentials.\nWe would like to thank Brian Laird, Taras Bryk,\nand La\u00b4szlo\u00b4 Gra\u00b4na\u00b4sy for helpful comments and discus-\nsion.
