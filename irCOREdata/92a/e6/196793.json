Introduction \nThe terrestrial biosphere takes up an amount of CO 2 equivalent \nto about one sixth of the total atmospheric inventory every year \n[see, e.g., $chimel, 1995]. This carbon flux into the biosphere rep- \nresents gross primary production (GPP), that is, carbon fixed in \nphotosynthesis (and not rapidly released in photorespiration) by \nterrestrial plants. About half of GPP is returned to the atmosphere \nas plant (autotrophic) respiration. The remainder epresents net pri- \nmary production (NPP), that is, carbon that accrues to the growth \nof plants. \nIn the absence of disturbance and major climatic fluctuations, \nannual net primary production (NPPyear) is believed to be almost \nin balance with annual heterotrophic respiration (R Hyear) by soil \nmicroorganisms, so that annual net ecosystem prod\u2022iction (NEP- \near), which represents thenet exchange b tween the terrestrial \niosphere and the atmosphere (NEP = NPP - RH), is relatively \nsmall. However, the rates of photosynthesis and detritus\/soil or- \nganic matter decomposition are under the control of different envi- \n2 HEIMANN ET AL.: EVALUATION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS \nronmental factors that are not synchronized during the seasonal \ncycle. On a weekly or monthly basis, NEP can therefore fluctuate \nover a large range of positive or negative values. Positive NEP (i.e., \nNPP > RH) indicates a terrestrial sink for atmospheric CO 2, where- \nas negative NEP (i.e., NPP < RH) indicates a terrestrial source for \natmospheric CO 2. This seasonal f uctuation of NEP is primarily re- \nsponsible for the observed seasonal variations in atmospheric CO 2 \ncontent, especially at high northern latitudes where these variations \nhave the greatest amplitude [Fung et al., 1983, 1987, Heimann et \nal., 1989]. The role played by land-atmosphere fluxes in causing \nthese seasonal variations is graphically demonstrated by \"flying \ncarpet\" diagrams that show the contrast in magnitude and a 180 \u00f8 \nphase difference between the cycles in the northern and southern \nhemispheres and phase plots that show annually repeated hystere- \nsis patterns in the relation between satellite-derived \"greenness\" \n(as normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI)) and detrended \natmospheric CO 2 concentrations in the northern and tropical lati- \ntude bands [Fung et al., 1987]. \nRecognition of the terrestrial biosphere's key role in the global \ncarbon cycle has prompted the development of several models to \nquantify the metabolism of terrestrial ecosystems at a global scale. \nSuch models are of two main types: diagnostic models, which use \nweekly to monthly remote sensing data such as composites of the \nnormalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) as input, and \nprognostic models, which use only environmental (climate and \nsoil) data as input. The first diagnostic terrestrial biosphere (or bio- \ngeochemical) models (TBMs) expressed NPP as a simple function \nof incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and NDVI \n[Fung et al., 1987; Heimann and Keeling, 1989]. More recent mod- \nels take into account more mechanistic aspects of primary produc- \ntion, including the constraints on the light use efficiency of \nevergreen vegetation imposed by low temperatures and drought \n[Potter et al., 1993; Ruimy et al., 1994]. The first prognostic mod- \nels expressed NPP as an empirical function of annual characteris- \ntics of climate (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and \nevapotranspiration [Lieth, 1975]); again, more recent models in- \nclude more mechanistic representations of processes including ex- \nplicit simulation of vegetation foliage cover and phenology as \nresponses to the environment. Thus the two types of models are \nconverging, and some current models can be run in either diagnos- \ntic or prognostic mode according to whether the seasonal variations \nin foliage cover are predicted or prescribed. \nGlobal TBMs are multiplying rapidly, as shown by recent pub- \nlications [e.g.,Raich et al., 1991; Melillo et al., 1993; Potter et al., \n1993; Foley, 1994; Ladeke et al., 1994; Ruimy et al., 1994; War- \nnant et al., 1994; Friend, 1995; Woodward et al., 1995; VEMAP \nMembers, 1995; Kaduk and Heimann, 1996]. The models are still \nquite diverse in their structure (for example, in whether nitrogen \ncycling is treated as an active pathway controlling NPP or as pas- \nsive consequence of a system driven by light and water); quantita- \ntive functions (there is a wide range of values used for key \nparameters, such as the temperature dependence of respiration); \nand results (models differ considerably in simulated spatial pat- \nterns and seasonality of NPP as well as in their simulated values for \ntotal global NPP, even when forced by identical inputs (Potsdam \n1994\/1995 workshops, [Lurin et al., 1994])). The existence of such \ndifferences indicates a need for evaluation to discriminate among \ndifferent formulations. However, so far, relatively little effort has \nbeen put into evaluating the performance of TBMs. Field-based \nNPP measurements represent a minimal benchmark. However, \nthey are imprecise, and being related to specific points in space and \ntime, they reflect strongly the local weather and soil characteristics \nat the time of measurement. Thus they do not directly test the large- \nscale aggregated flux computations that are more important for the \nmodel's applications to the global carbon cycle. \nAn alternative approach is provided by the available time series \nof CO 2 measurements in the remote atmosphere, which offer an \nappropriately large spatial scale for evaluating the aggregated car- \nbon fluxes simulated by TBMs. The CO 2 measurement data give a \nclear picture of the seasonal cycles, latitudinal gradients, interan- \nnual variability, and (increasingly) stable isotope composition of \natmospheric CO 2 [Keeling et al., 1989, 1995; Conway et al., \n1994a], all of which are in principle predictable by TBMs. Howev- \ner, such comparisons are complicated by the need to specify in ad- \ndition fossil fuel emissions and to model not only the terrestrial \nbiosphere-atmosphere carbon exchanges but also the correspond- \ning ocean-atmosphere exchanges and the three-dimensional trans- \nport of CO 2 by winds from the atmospheric and oceanic exchange \nsites to the remote measurement sites. A rigorous evaluation thus \nrequires that the TBMs are linked to accurate representations of \nfossil fuel CO 2 emissions, ocean-atmosphere s asonal CO 2 fluxes, \nand atmospheric tracer transport [Heimann et al., 1989]. Despite \nthe fact that neither of these additional factors is known at present \nto sufficient accuracy, the approach, nevertheless, provides a con- \nsistent framework within which to assess ome aspects of large- \nscale carbon fluxes as simulated by TBMs. \nThis paper focuses on mean seasonal cycles of atmospheric CO 2 \nconcentration, as recorded at 27 background monitoring stations of \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\/Climate \nMonitoring and Diagnostic Laboratory (NOAA\/CMDL) flask \nsampling network [Conway et al., 1994a] covering all the major \nclimatic zones of the earth. It describes the results of a TBM inter- \ncomparison in which six TBMs (one diagnostic and five prognostic \nmodels) have been run under similar protocols on a 0.5 \u00f8 grid \n(55.6x 55.6 km 2 at the quator). Each TBM was run to equilibrium \nfor each grid element; that is, the annual totals of NPP and R H are \nequal (NPPyea r = RH, year). As a consequence, the NEPyea r sti- \nmates of the TBMs are not appropriate for examining me spatial \npattern of the anthropogenically induced terrestrial sink for atmo- \nspheric CO 2 believed to be operating today [Schimel et al., 1995]. \nHowever, the temporal NEP estimates are useful for simulating the \nseasonal dynamics of CO 2 throughout the biosphere. The spatially \nexplicit monthly results of the TBMs (NPP and RH), combined \nwith equivalent seasonal CO 2 flux fields generated by the Ham- \nburg Model of the Oceanic Carbon Cycle (HAMOCC3) [Maier- \nReimer, 1993, Six and Maier-Reimer, 1996] and fossil fuel source \nfields derived from standard sources [Marland et al., 1989], have \nbeen used to provide the lower boundary condition to a three-di- \nmensional tracer transport model (TM2) forced by observed winds \n(Figure 1). The seasonal cycles at locations corresponding to the \nsampling stations have been extracted and compared with the (de- \ntrended) measurements ateach station. The objective was to deter- \nmine the extent to which different models can simulate the \nobserved seasonal cycles and latitudinal patterns. \n2. Model Descriptions \n2.1. Ocean Model \nMonthly fluxes of CO 2 between the atmosphere and the surface \nlayer of the ocean were obtained from a standard run of the Ham- \nburg Model of the Ocean Carbon Cycle (HAMOCC3) [Maier-Re- \nHEIMANN ET AL.: EVALUATION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS 3 \nMeteorologi- \ncal Analyses \nAtmospheric \nTransport \nModel (TM2) \n..\u2022[ Simulated CO2 \n\u2022'-[ Concentration \nIntercomparison \nObservations \nfrom Global \nMonitoring \nNetwork \nFossil \nco2 \nOceanic CO2 \nExchange \nFluxes (Cal- \nculated by \nHAMOCC3+ \nTerrestrial Bio- \nspheric CO2 \nExchange Fluxes \n(calculated by \nTBM) \nFigure 1. Flowchart of the data flow and and the model links. \nimer, 1993] enhanced with a recently developed model of the \nmarine biosphere [Kurz, 1993; Six and Maier-Reimer, 1996]. The \nocean carbon cycle model is embedded in the global three-dimen- \nsional, seasonal flow field of the Hamburg Large-Scale Geo- \nstrophic ocean circulation model (LSG) [Maier-Reimer et al., \n1993]. HAMOCC3 describes the cycling of oceanic carbon in its \nthree inorganic forms on a three-dimensional grid with a horizontal \nresolution of approximately 3.5 \u00f8 and 12 layers in the vertical di- \nmension. The marine biosphere is described in the model by two \norganic carbon pools which represent phytoplankton and zoop- \nlankton. Gas exchange at the surface is computed in the model by \nthe air-sea difference in partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2) multiplied \nby a wind speed and temperature dependent gas exchange formu- \nlation according to Liss and Merlivat [1986], scaled to satisfy the \nconstraint imposed by the global bomb radiocarbon balance \n[Heirnann and Monfray, 1989]. \nIn this study we employed monthly net sea-to-air fluxes of CO 2 \nas calculated by a steady state run of HAMOCC3 with a pre- \nscribed, constant atmospheric CO 2 concentration. The model com- \nputed pCO 2 fields, which are the major driving force for the \nseasonal air-sea exchange flux of CO 2, show a fair agreement with \nobservational time series and regional survey data [Kurz, 1993]. \nFurthermore, an alternative validation based on the seasonal cycle \nof oxygen in the atmosphere also confirms that the model-calculat- \ned effects of the marine biosphere on the ocean carbon system are \nreasonably well simulated, at least in the southern hemisphere \n[Kurz, 1993; Six and Maier-Reimer, 1996]. \n2.2. Atmospheric Transport Model \nThe three-dimensional tmospheric transport model used in this \nstudy is the TM2 model [Heimann, 1995], representing a further \ndevelopment of the TM1 model used in numerous previous atmo- \nspheric CO 2 simulation studies [e.g. Heimann and Keeling, 1989; \nHeimann et al., 1989] and which originated from the Goddard In- \nstitute for Space Studies tracer model [Russell and Lerner, 1981 ]. \nTM2 solves the continuity equation of an atmospheric onstituent \non a three-dimensional Eulerian grid spanning the whole globe. \nThe standard coarse grid resolution employed in this study is ap- \nproximately 7.83 \u00f8 latitude by 10 \u00f8 longitude and nine layers in the \nvertical dimension. Tracer transport is described in the model by \nmeans of specified three-dimensional time-varying wind fields and \nby a vertical transport parametrization representing vertical mixing \nby cumulus clouds and by turbulent diffusion. The meteorological \nwind fields used in the simulation experiments are based on 12- \nhourly analyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weath- \ner Forecasts for the year 1987. \nThere exist quite a few approaches to model atmospheric trans- \nport, and a recent intercomparison among global transport models \n[Law et al., 1996] revealed substantial differences in the concentra- \ntion fields computed from the same prescribed surface sources by \ndifferent transport models. The TM2 model in many respects per- \nformed close to the \"typical\" coarse-grid transport model [Law et \nal., 1996]. Clearly, an assessment of the sensitivity of the present \nresults with respect o atmospheric transport, for example, by mak- \ning use of different transport models, would be worthwhile but is \nbeyond the scope of the present paper. \nFor the simulation experiments described below, each source \nwas prescribed as a seasonally varying surface flux and the trans- \nport models was run for 4 years until the modeled atmospheric CO 2 \nconcentration reached an approximatly cyclo-stationary state. The \nresults of the fourth year were used in the subsequent analysis. \n2.3. Terrestrial Biosphere Models \nSix global terrestrial biogeochemical models were examined in \nthis intercomparison study: the BIOME2 model, the Frankfurt Bio- \nsphere Model (FBM), the High-Resolution Biosphere Model \n(HRBM), the Simple Diagnostic Biosphere Model (SDBM1), the \nSimulating Land Vegetation and NPP Model (SILVAN), and the \nTerrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). Although all these models \nsimulate the exchange of carbon between atmosphere and terrestri- \nal biosphere, they use different approaches for the calculation of \nNPP. The diagnostic model included in this study (SDBM1) uses \nmonthly NDVI data to estimate absorbed radiation which is then \ntranslated into NPP through an efficiency coefficient. In contrast, \nHEIMANN ET AL.: EVALUATION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS \nthe five prognostic models either calculate NPP directly from sta- \ntistical relations between temperature and precipitation which is \nthen modified as functions of soil characteristics (HRBM), or they \nestimate NPP as the difference between GPP and autotrophic res- \npiration (BIOME2, FBM, SILVAN, and TEM). In HRBM, \nSDBM1, and TEM, climate data enter into the flux calculations as \nmonthly means, while BIOME2, FBM, and SILVAN apply simple \nalgorithms to interpolate to daily values from the monthly climate \ndata and determine fluxes on a daily time step. All models consider \ncarbon and water cycling, but the TEM also includes nitrogen dy- \nnamics. Among the TBMs, phytomass is represented by different \nnumbers of carbon pools (BIOME2, 3; FBM, 2; HRBM, 4; \nSDBM1,0; SILVAN, 3; and TEM, 1). Gross photosynthesis (GPP) \nis either calculated with a multiple limitation approach (FBM and \nTEM) or by modified versions of the Farquhar model [Farquhar et \nal., 1980] (BIOME2 and SILVAN). Although R H in all models is \ncalculated by relationships that depend on soil carbon, tempera- \nture, and soil moisture, either the formulations of the relationships \nor the parameters of similar formulations differ among the models. \nThe brief model descriptions given in the following subsections \n2.3.1. to 2.3.6. will concentrate on the historic development and the \nmain features and assumptions of each model that determine the \ncomputation of the CO 2 exchange fluxes on the seasonal timescale. \nA short model comparison is given in Table 1; more detailed infor- \nmation can be found in the references cited at the beginning of each \nsubsection. \n2.3.1. BIOME2. BIOME2 [Haxeltine et al., 1996, Haxeltine \nand Prentice, 1996] is a coupled carbon and water-flux simulation \nmodel that has been designed for use in predicting the response of \nglobal natural vegetation to changing climates. Thus the model \ndoes not use a map of global vegetation as a forcing data set but in- \nstead predicts global vegetation patterns as a model output. The \nB IOME2 has a simple two-layer hydrology model which allows a \nrealistic simulation of the drought stress experienced by vegetation \nand a mechanistic carbon balance model. Model output consists of \npredictions of NPP, leaf area index, and vegetation type, which is \nthe combination ofplant types which maximizes whole ecosystem \nnet primary production (NPP) at a particular site. Woody and grass \nplant types are differentiated according to their physiological nd \nphenological attributes and rooting strategies. \nThe modeling approach as been to produce a mechanistic mod- \nel of natural ecosystems which, nevertheless, has a level of com- \nplexity appropriate for use at the global scale with monthly climate \ndata. The monthly climate fields are linearly interpolated yielding \nquasi-daily values for use in the water-flux model [Haxeltine et al., \n1996]. \nPhotosynthesis is calculated using a semimechanistic l ght use \nefficiency (LUE) model. The LUE model is basically an optimized \nversion of the Farquhar photosynthesis model [Collatz et al., 1991, \n1992]. Instead of prescribing values for the parameter Vm (the max- \nimum catalytic capacity of the enzyme \"ribulose biphosphate car- \nboxylase oxygenase\" per unit leaf area), an optimal value for V m \ngiven a particular vegetation type (C3 or C4 plants) and set of en- \nvironmental conditions is calculated. The result is an equation for \nphotosynthesis which is linearly dependent on absorbed photosyn- \nthetically active radiation (APAR) such that \nGPPma x = FPCfl(CO 2, T, d) APAR (1) \nwhere GPPma x is the potential or \"maximum possible\" GPP, \nfl(CO2,T,d) represents he semimechanistic LUE equation which \ndepends on temperature (T), ambient carbon dioxide concentration \n(CO 2) and the day length (d). Foliar projected cover (FPC) is the \nvariable used to define leaf area in B IOME2. It is measured as the \nfraction of ground covered by foliage vertically above it (i.e., val- \nues ranging from 0-1). FPC is calculated from one-sided leaf area \nindex (LAI) using Beer's law [Monsi and Saeki, 1953]: \n-LAI?2 \nFPC = 1 - e (2) \nAn optimal value of FPC is predicted for each model grid square, \nand this optimal value of FPC is used in the final NPP calculation. \nThe potential GPP is then reduced by a scalar in order to take \ninto account the effects of drought stress (\u2022D) and temperature \nextremes ( \u2022r ): \nGPP - GPPma x \u2022a \u2022T (3) \nFinally, net primary production is calculated by subtracting whole \nplant respiration costs, which are currently estimated as being 50% \nof GPPma x. \nHeterotrophic respiration (RH) is calculated from a relationship \nderived by Lloyd and Taylor [1994] and Howard and Howard \n[1993], where CO 2 evolution is related to both monthly soil tem- \nperature and average monthly soil moisture content. Monthly soil \ntemperature was derived from air temperature assuming an attenu- \nation factor and a phase lag computed by the propagation of an an- \nnual heat wave through soil [Campbell 1977]. R H is calculated \nusing the following relationship: \nR n -- Ot f2(rsoil)f3(Wsoil) (4) \nwhere Wsoil s the soil moisture. The value a can be regarded as the \nproduct of the soil decay rate, which is dependent on the soil type, \nand the mass of soil carbon. An initial estimate of a was subse- \nquently scaled such that the steady state constraint condition \n(NPPyea r -- RH,year) was satisfied. Thus, monthly heterotrophic res- \npiration estimates were obtained. This method avoids the need to \nexplicitly define the various soil decay rates and also the need for \nestimating the soil carbon content. \n2.3.2. Frankfurt Biosphere Model (FBM). The FBM [Kin- \ndermann et al., 1993; Liideke et al., 1994; Kohlmaier et al., 1997] \nconsists of a mechanistic arbon model and a simple one-layer \nbucket model for soil moisture. Litter and soil organic carbon are \ncombined in one soil compartment. Vegetation is represented by \ntwo compartments to which assimilated carbon is allocated by an \nallometric relation. Model output includes daily carbon exchange \nfluxes, leaf area, phytomass and soil carbon. \nThe two vegetation compartments are green carbon compart- \nment (GC) comprising leaves and feeder roots with a lifetime of up \nto about 4 years and a residual carbon compartment (RC) which in- \ncludes the carbon mass stored in branches, stem, and roots. The dy- \nnamics of all three carbon compartments result from the daily input \nand output fluxes as follows: \n1. Carbon assimilation (GPP) is calculated using a factorial ap- \nproach in which a vegetation type specific maximum assimilation \nrate (GPPmax) is multiplied by different factors for the dependence \non leaf area index (LAI) (calculated from leaf mass and a vegeta- \ntion type dependent specific leaf area), incident photosynthetic ac- \ntive radiation (PAR), air temperature (T), the ratio of actual to \npotential evapotranspiration (AET\/PET), and atmospheric CO 2 \nconcentration \nAET \nGPP = GPPmaxf4(PAR, LAI)fs(r) p--\u2022-\u2022 f6(CO2) (5) \nHEIMANN ET AL.'

Autotrophic respiration from GC and RC which depends on \ncompartment size and an exponential function of temperature with \na constant Qlo value specified for each vegetation type. \n3. Litter production (LP) is proportional to the compartment \nsize with a constant coefficient except for the GC compartment of \ndeciduous vegetation which will shed the leaves within about \n1 month. \n4. Heterotrophic respiration (RH) uses the temperature d pen- \ndence of Fung et al. [1987], linear dependence on compartment \nsize, and a soil moisture factor analogous to the moisture depen- \ndence of photosynthesis. \nThe phenological behavior of the model is governed by a set of \nrules for carbon partitioning of evergreen a d deciduous vegetation \ntypes. The leaf shooting phase starts when the carbon gain from \nphotosynthesis i  greater than the carbon losses. The system allo- \ncates most of the assimilates tothe GC compartment until GC cor- \nresponds to RC as defined by an allometric relation [Janecek et al., \n1989] \nb \nRC -- a GC' (6) \n(with a and b dependent on vegetation type), which states that a \nminimum amount of RC is required to support a given mass of \nleaves and feeder roots. During the secondary growth phase the \nsystem is forced to allocate simultaneously into the GC and RC \ncompartments in such a way that (6) remains valid. The end of the \nvegetation period is defined by unfavorable weather conditions \nwhich result in biomass decrease. \nFor deciduous vegetation types a leaf abscission phase follows \nin which the GC compartment is reduced to a residual amount \nwhich is defined by the function \nRC = c GC d (7) \n(with c and d dependent on vegetation type). In the following dor- \nmancy phase the carbon losses (litter production and autotrophic \nrespiration) are distributed among the compartments o that (7) re- \nmains valid. \nFor evergreen vegetation types the vegetation period is fol- \nlowed by a standby phase in which the losses of GC and RC are \ncharacterized by constant proportions. All flux equations contain \nfree parameters which are determined through calibration for a \nsteady state such that the mean annual gross and net primary pro- \nductivity and heterotrophic respiration of a vegetation type equal \naverage cological estimates. The model requires hourly values of \ntemperature and radiation as well as daily precipitation and a vari- \nety of static data about vegetation and soil. Daily precipitation is \nobtained from the monthly values by means of a smooth redistribu- \ntion. In a similar way the monthly mean temperature and mean \ncloudiness are interpolated to daily values. The hourly values of \ntemperature are generated with the help of a sinusoidal function us- \ning independent estimates of daily temperature range for each veg- \netation type. The percentage cloudiness i constant over the day, \nand the diurnal cycle of radiation is calculated using the \u2022ngstr6m \nrelationship. \nIt is then possible to calculate the seasonal courses of LAI, phy- \ntomass, GPP, NPP, and R H in a steady state (NPP -- LP -- year year \nRH,\u00beear) as well as the long-term development of nonclimax veg- \netation. \nAn application of the FBM to different climate scenarios for the \nnorthern forest biomes is described by Liideke et al. [ 1995] and the \nvalidation of the model-predicted phenology using NDVI data is \ngiven in Liideke et al. [ 1996]. \n2.3.3. High-Resolution Biosphere Model (HRBM). The \nHRBM is the successor of the Osnab\u2022ck Biosphere Model [Esser, \n1987, 1991 ]. It represents the biosphere by nine carbon pools and \nin its version 3.0 includes modules dealing with vegetation fires \nand human influences through land use changes and emissions \nfrom fossil fuel and from industry. A detailed description is given \nby Esser et al. [ 1994]. \nThe nine biospheric arbon pools are herbaceous and woody \nlive phytomass, litter from herbaceous and woody material (dead \nphytomass), and soil organic arbon, with the live and dead phyto- \nmass pools subdivided into aboveground and belowground pools. \nThe biospheric fluxes are net primary productivity (NPP), litter \nproduction (LP), soil organic carbon production and heterotrophic \nrespiration (RH). NPP is calculated individually for each of the four \ncompartments of live phytomass. \nIn the HRBM, empirical models are used to calculate annual net \nprimary production (NPPyear) [Esser, 1987, 1991 ] and litter pro- \nduction (LPyear) [Esser, 1991 ],which are seasonally distributed af-\nterward. The distribution of NPPyea r follows monthly actual \nevapotranspiration (AET), which is derived from a simple bucket \nmodel [Prentice etal., 1992]. The distribution f LPyea r from her- \nbaceous phytomass follows the relative decrease of AET between \n2 months. In biomes with seasonal litter fall (\"temperate decidu- \nous,\" \"cool mixed,\" \"cold mixed,\" \"cold deciduous,\" and \"tun- \ndra\"), litter production starts when monthly air temperature drops \nto half of the mean monthly temperature of the warmest month (on \nthe centigrade scale) and reduces the herbaceous phytomass by half \nwithin 14 days. In contrast, the litter production coefficient from \nwoody phytomass is assumed to be 1\/12 of the annual value each \nmonth. \nThe litter decomposition flux is proportional to the size of the \nlitter pool. The value of the coefficient depends on the composition \nof the litter material and on climate. While decomposition i creas- \nes exponentially with air temperature, the dependence on precipi- \ntation is a skewed maximum function with an initial steep \ndecomposition i crease with increasing precipitation followed by \na slower decrease in decomposition athigh precipitation rates. The \nmaximum decomposition rate is also dependent on temperature: \nhigher temperatures shift the maximum decomposition to higher \nprecipitation rates. \nThe primary factors that control seasonal CO 2 exchanges be- \ntween the biosphere and the atmosphere are the seasonal air tem- \nperature and precipitation signal which affect monthly NPP, LP, \nand decomposition. I  this intercomparison experiment the mod- \nules that refer to land use and vegetation fires have not been con- \nsidered. \n2.3.4. Simple Diagnostic Biosphere Model (SDBM1). The \nSDBM1 [Knorr and Heimann, 1995] is a simple, diagnostic, glo- \nbally uniform model of monthly CO 2 exchange between the atmo- \nsphere and the terrestrial biosphere. Modeled NPP and R H are \ncomputed from remote sensing and climate data. The model ver- \nsion employed in this study is the formulation I described in the \nKnorr and Heimann [ 1995] work, in which both NPP and R H de- \npend also on water stress computed using a simple bucket model. \nCarbon uptake by vegetation (NPP) is calculated from estimates \nof photosynthetically ctive radiation (PAR) absorbed by vegeta- \ntion, which is determined from a combination ofbi-weekly maxi- \nma of the normalized-difference v getation index (NDVI) of the \nNOAA 9 satellite (1985-1989) [Gallo, 1992] and cloudiness data, \nregridded from the original mercator projection grid (approximate- \nly 10' resolution at the equator) to the 0.5\u00f8x0.5 \u00f8 standard latitude- \nHElMANN ET AL.: EVALUATION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS 7 \nlongitude model grid. A one-layer bucket model calculates water \nstress as the ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration \n(AET\/PET) from monthly means of precipitation, temperature, and \ncloudiness. \nSpecifically, NPP is calculated from \nAET NPP = a 1.222 (NDVI_ 0.1566 PAR (8) \u2022, 0.559 P\u2022 \nwhere PAR is assumed to be half of mean monthly global radiation \nat the surface [W m'2]. Carbon release from soils is assumed tode- \npend on relative evapotranspiration and exponentially on air tem- \nperature, T, with no cutoff at low freezing temperatures \nr\/10 AET RH = [l Q lO ( p\u2022 ) (9) \nrz and Qlo are globally uniform parameters determined from fitting \nthe model-derived seasonal cycle to atmospheric CO 2 observations \nfrom five key stations in the northern hemisphere, selected to cover \napproximately uniformly the major regions in temperate latitudes \nwith strongly seasonal vegetation (Qlo = 1.5 and ct = 0.68 gC (MJ \nPAR)-I). The value of the parameter\/l is not globally uniform, but \nis determined from the condition f equilibrium (NPPyea r =\nRH,year). \n2.3.5. Simulating Land Vegetation and NPP Model (SIL- \nVAN). SILVAN [Kaduk and Helmann, 1996, Kaduk, 1996] con- \nsists of a mechanistic carbon model and a simple one-layer bucket \nmodel for the estimation of the water balance. The biosphere is rep- \nresented by three pools of living biomass (assimilates, herbaceous, \nand woody phytomass) and three pools of dead biomass (herba- \nceous and woody litter and soil organic carbon). Model output in- \ncludes daily exchange fluxes of carbon, LAI (single sided), \nbiomass, and soil carbon. \nThe assimilate pool represents carbohydrates serving as re- \nserves for the plants. Herbaceous biomass includes leaves and fine \nroots, woody biomass sapwood, and heartwood of stems and roots. \nFixed fractions of the herbaceous and woody carbon pools are con- \nsidered as belowground carbon. Leaf area index is linearly related \nto aboveground herbaceous carbon and constrained by growing \nconditions and the diagnostically computed sapwood cross-sec- \ntional area. \nAssimilation at the leaf level is simulated by applying a simpli- \nfied version of the photosynthesis model of Farquhar et al. [ 1980]. \nLeaf assimilation is then scaled to the canopy with the current leaf \narea index and a fixed light extinction coefficient of k -- 0.5. Inte- \ngrating the diurnal cycle of temperature and PAR results in nonwa- \nter-stressed aily assimilation. This rate is then adjusted by the \nratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration. \nAssimilated carbon is stored in the assimilate pool and used for \nrespiration and growth. Maintenance and growth respiration are \nsimulated for leaf, fine root, and sapwood compartments. Mainte- \nnance respiration rates are tied to the maximal assimilation rate. \nThe temperature dependence of maintenance respiration is simu- \nlated by an Arrhenius relationship adjusted to be equivalent to a \nQ\u2022o of 2 at the optimal temperature for net assimilation. \nGrowth, starting with bud burst, is triggered in tropical biomes \nwhen production conditions are good, that is, when drought stress \nis low (AET\/PET>0.4). Thus the model does not impose any dor- \nmancy for the tropical vegetation, hence which may respond in- \nstantaneously to improved weather conditions. In temperate \nbiomes, growth begins when the growing degree day temperature \nsum exceeds a certain threshold depending on chilling days and the \nbiome. (The growing degree day sum is defined by the sum of the \nmean daily temperatures above 5\u00f8C since December 1 for the \nnorthern and June 1 for the southern hemispheres.) Relations of \nthis type have been shown to describe the date of bud burst in tem- \nperate biomes rather well [Murrey et el., 1989]. The biome depen- \ndent parameter values in the formulae have been determined by an \nevaluation of satellite data. In contrast to tropical vegetation this \nmodeling approach implies a dormancy period for the temperate \nvegetation, since growth only starts after the temperature sum ex- \nceeds a threshold. \nThe allocation strategy employed in SILVAN aims at maximi- \nzation of NPP. Allocation of carbon is directed from the assimilate \npool to the leaves until an optimal LAI is reached. This optimal \nLAI is defined by resulting in maximal NPP given the current en- \nvironmental conditions and current plant state. Further assimilates \nare allocated to wood according to an allometric relation of sap- \nwood and LAI as long as this leads to an increase in NPP thereby \nincreasing the potential LAI that the vegetation can support with \nwater by increasing sapwood cross-sectional rea. Excess assimi- \nlates are directed to dead structural wood. \nNo a priori limits are imposed on the simulated LAI. Typical \nmean annual LAI for a grid cell (biome average) ranges from 0.2 \nto 3.8 depending on the biome. Intrabiome variation is typically \nlow because of similar climate and constant biological parameter \nvalues. \nIn all biomes a low continuous leaf mortality is in effect at all \ntimes, mimicking herbivore consumption and decay of photosyn- \nthetic potential throughout the growing season. Beyond this base \nmortality rate, leaf and fine root shedding in tropical biomes fol- \nlows the production conditions; that is, if AET\/PET > 0.4 and the \ncurrent LAI is higher than the optimal LAI estimated for the time \nstep, a fraction of the excess herbaceous biomass is shed. If AET\/ \nPET<0.4, then all herbaceous biomass is shed within 2 weeks. In \ntemperature biomes, shedding of herbaceous biomass is initiated \nwhen daily minimum temperature drops below 0\u00f8C and it is as- \nsumed to last 1 month. Woody litter production proceeds with a \nfixed rate throughout he whole year. \nFinally, litter decomposition rates are modeled by empirical \nfunctions depending on temperature and precipitation as in previ- \nous versions of the HRBM [Esser, 1991 ]; heterotrophic respiration \nis the product of the rates and current pool sizes. \nIn summary, SILVAN features a fully climate-driven phenolo- \ngy using simple empirical functions which are based on results \nfrom field experiments. Note that in SILVAN phenology and allo- \ncation are not only crucial for production but also for heterotrophic \nrespiration, as they determine timing and amount of litter produc- \ntion. \n2.3.6. Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). The Terrestrial \nEcosystem Model (TEM) is described in detail by Reich et el. \n[ 1991 ], McGuire et el. [ 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997], and Melillo et el. \n[1993]. To date, TEM has been used to examine patterns of NPP \nfor potential vegetation in South America [Reich et el., 1991 ] and \nNorth America [McGuire et el., 1992] and to examine the potential \nresponse of NPP and carbon storage to climate change [McGuire et \nel., 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997; Melillo et el., 1993, 1995; Joyce et el., \n1995]. In this study we use version 4.0 of TEM [McGuire et el., \n1995]. \nThe TEM is a process-based ecosystem simulation model that \nuses spatially explicit data on climate, soil texture, vegetation, and \nwater availability to make monthly estimates of important carbon \nand nitrogen fluxes and pool sizes. The TEM is a highly aggregated \nmodel in which terrestrial ecosystems are represented by one veg- \n10.0 \n5.0 \n0.0 \n-5.0 \n-10.0 I ' ' I I i, \u2022 .....

Hydrology for TEM is determined by the \nwater balance model of Vtrtsmarty et al., [ 1989]. \nParameters in TEM are vegetation-specific, soil-specific, or \nconstant. The vegetation used by TEM in this study is an updated \nversion of the vegetation given by Melillo et al. [ 1993]. Although \nmost of the vegetation-specific parameters are defined either from \nthe literature or from statistical analyses of data, the rate-limiting \nparameters in most flux equations are determined by calibration. \nThe calibration of these parameters is one technique for addressing \nissues of temporal and spatial scale in the model [see Rastetter et \nal., 1992]. In TEM the rate-limiting parameters are determined by \ncalibrating the model so that it estimates the equilibrium fluxes and \npools of an intensively studied field site, that is, the calibration site \nfor the vegetation type. Data used to calibrate the rate-limiting pa- \nrameters of version 4.0 are documented in Table 1 of McGuire et \nal. [1995]. \nThe seasonality of carbon exchange between the terrestrial bio- \nsphere and the atmosphere is influenced by differences in the sea- \nsonality of NPP and R H. In TEM, NPP is calculated as the \ndifference between GPP and plant respiration. A number of factors \ninfluence the seasonality of GPP, which is calculated monthly as \nfollows \nGPP -- GPPma x LEAF f7(PAR) f8(T) f9(CO2, H20) flo(NA) (10) \nwhere GPPma x is the maximum rate of C assimilation, PAR is pho- \ntc\u2022synthetically active radiation, LEAF is leaf area relative to max- \nimum leaf area, T is monthly mean air temperature, CO 2 is the \natmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, H20 is water avail- \nability, and NA is nitrogen availability. The parameter GPPma x is \nthe rate-limiting parameter in the GPP equation and is determined \nby calibration. Of the several functions in the GPP equation, LEAF \nplays a major role in the controlling the seasonality of C assimila- \ntion. This function simulates relative changes in the photosynthetic \ncapacity of mature vegetation from estimated actual evapotranspi- \nration and the previous month's photosynthetic apacity [Raich et \nal., 1991]: \nLEAFj = a(EETj\/EETmax) + b(LEAFj_ l) + c (11) \nwhere LEAFj is the relative l af phenology in the current month j, \nEETj is the estimated actual evapotranspiration in the current \nmonth, EETma x is the maximum monthly evapotranspiration, and \nLEAFj. 1 is relative l af phenology in the previous month. Note that \nLEAF is constrained to be between 1.0 and a minimum relative leaf \nphenology. The parameters a, b, and c are vegetation-specific pa- \nrameters [see McGuire et al., 1992] that are determined by regress- \ning the relative leaf phenology of the current month with EET\/ \nEETma x and the previous month's leaf phenology for a site with \nseasonal data on leaf area. Relative leaf phenology is calculated as \nthe ratio of leaf area index in the current month to the maximum \nmonthly leaf area index. \nThe functions f7, fs, f9, and flo also influence the seasonality of \nC assimilation. The functionf7(PAR) describes the effect of photo- \nsynthetically active radiation on C assimilation. Becausef7 is a sca- \nlar function that increases hyperbolically from 0 to 1 as PAR \nincreases [see Raich et al., 1991], it tends to increase GPP more \nduring months with greater solar radiation at the top of the canopy. \nThe function f8(T) describes the effects of air temperature on C \nassimilation. This function increases parabolically from 0 to 1 be- \ntween the minimum and optimum temperature of photosynthesis \n[see Raich et al., 1991 ] and remains at 1 until it reaches the maxi- \nmum temperature of photosynthesis where it decreases paraboli- \ncally to 0 [see McGuire et al., 1995]. The minimum and maximum \ntemperatures of photosynthesis are vegetation-specific parameters \nthat are defined by the growing season limits of the vegetation type \n[see McGuire et al., 1995]. The optimum temperature of photosyn- \nthesis is grid-cell-specific and is defined as the month of maximum \nrelative leaf phenology for the grid cell [see McGuire et al., 1995]. \nThus f8 tends to increase GPP most during months when the tem- \nperature xceeds the temperature of the month with maximum leaf \narea. \nThe functionf9(CO2,H20) describes the simultaneous effects of \natmospheric CO 2 and water availability on C assimilation. This \nfunction calculates a scalar that increases hyperbolically from 0 to \n1 as the intercellular concentration of CO 2 increases [see Raich et \nal., 1991 ]. Intercellular CO 2 is the product of atmospheric CO 2 and \nrelative canopy conductance, which is approximately alinear func- \ntion of the ratio of actual estimated evapotranspiration topotential \nevapotranspiration (EET\/PET) [see Raich et al., 1991; McGuire et \nal., 1992]. Because the seasonal variation of atmospheric CO 2 is a \nsmall fraction of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, the seasonal- \nity of f9 is primarily determined by the seasonality of EET\/PET, \nwhich is highest in wet months and lowest in dry months. \nThe function flo(NA) describes how carbon-nitrogen status of \nthe vegetation, i.e., nitrogen availability or supply, influences car- \nbon assimilation. Nitrogen supply is the sum of nitrogen uptake \nplus nitrogen mobilized from the vegetation labile nitrogen pool \n[McGuire et al., 1993]. Nitrogen supply is generally greatest early \nin the growing season when vegetation is able to mobilize nitrogen \nfrom storage. Nitrogen uptake depends on temperature, soil mois- \nture, and inorganic nitrogen in the soil solution [see Raich et al., \n1991] and increases for higher air temperature, higher soil mois- \nture, and higher inorganic nitrogen. Net nitrogen mineralization, \nwhich depends in part on decomposition, replenishes inorganic ni- \ntrogen, and tends to be greater for higher air temperature and high- \ner soil moisture. Thus, the seasonality offl o is influenced by the \ndynamics of vegetation nitrogen storage, nitrogen uptake, and ni- \ntrogen mineralization. \nIn TEM, the calculation of plant respiration considers both \nmaintenance and construction respiration. Maintenance respiration \n(Rm) is calculated as follows: \nrTT \nR m -- K r C v e (12) \nwhere K r is the per-gram respiration rate of vegetation biomass at \n0\u00f8C, C v is the mass of carbon in the vegetation, T is the mean \nmonthly air temperature, and r T is the instantaneous rate of change \nin respiration with air temperature. The parameter Kr is the rate- \nlimiting parameter in the R m equation and is determined by calibra- \ntion. The parameter r T is equal to ln(Q1 o)\/10 where Q\u2022 o is the rate \nof change of respiration due to a 10\u00f8C increase in temperature. In\nTEM, Qlo is modeled as follows [see McGuire et al., 1992]: \nQ\u2022o -- 2.35665 +0.05308 T+ 0.00238 T2 - 0.00004 T4 (13) \nwhere T is mean monthly air temperature. This function approxi- \nmates a linear increase in Q\u2022o from 1.5 to 2.0 between 40 \u00f8 and \n20\u00f8C, a constant Q\u2022o of 2 between 20 \u00f8 and 5\u00f8C, and a linear in- \ncrease in Qlo from 2.0 to 2.5 between 5 \u00f8 and 0\u00f8C [see Larcher, \n1980]. The seasonality of R m is determined primarily by the sea- \nsonality in T and secondarily by the seasonality inC v. The season- \nHElMANN ET AL.: EVALUATION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS 11 \nality of construction respiration, which is calculated as 20% of the \ndifference between GPP and R m, depends on the relative seasonal- \nity of GPP and R m. \nA number of factors influence the seasonality of R H, which is \ncalculated as follows: \nRH= K d sac fll(T) f12(Srn) (14) \nwhere K d is the per-gram respiration rate ofsoil organic carbon \n(sac) at 0\u00f8C, T is mean monthly air temperature, and S m is volu- \nmetric soil moisture. The parameter K d is the rate-limiting param- \neter in the R H equation and is determined by calibration. The \nseasonality of R H is primarily determined by the seasonality of J)l \nand J)2. The function J)l(T) describes the effect of mean monthly \nair temperature on heterotrophic respiration and is modeled as an \nexponential function of T with a Q\u2022o of 2.0. Thus the seasonality of \nJ)\u2022 depends on the seasonality of air temperature. The function \n)\u20222(Srn) describes the effect of soil moisture on decomposition, \nwhich is a parabolic relationship that depends on volumetric soil \nmoisture and has an optimum at approximately field capacity. Thus \nthe seasonality off\u2022 2 depends on the seasonality of soil moisture. \n3. Data \n3.1. Input Data for the TBMs \nAn equilibrium run was performed for each of the six terrestrial \nbiosphere models under a prescribed atmospheric a 2 concentra- \ntion of 340 parts per million by volume (ppmv). All of the models \nFor each station record the following procedure was used to ex- \ntract the seasonal cycle of atmospheric a 2 from the station \nrecords. First, a smooth continuous representation of the interannu- \nal ca 2 concentration trend was obtained by interpolating the annu- \nal mean concentrations with Hermite cubics. Thereby the needed \nfirst derivatives of the trend function at the center of each year were \nestimated by centered differences from the annual mean concentra- \ntions of the adjacent years. Second, trend-corrected monthly con- \ncentration values were calculated by subtracting the interannual \nca 2 trend function from the monthly observations. Third, monthly \nestimates of the seasonal cycle and of its variability were obtained \nby computing average and 1 standard deviation of all trend-correct- \ned January, February, etc., values within the time window 1983- \n1992. The standard eviations reflect the interannual variability of \nthe seasonal cycle within the selected time window. A total of 27 \nstations from the NaAA network contained sufficiently long \nrecords to perform this procedure (Figure 2). A list of the selected \nstations is given in Table 2. \n3.3. CO 2 Source From Fossil Fuel Burning \nThe component in the atmospheric ca 2 concentration resulting \nfrom the release of ca 2 from fossil fuel burning and cement man- \nufacture was computed based on a global 1 \u00f8x 1 \u00f8 map compiled by \nMarland et al. [1989]. Fossil fuel ca 2 emissions were assumed to \nbe constant in time during each year. In several regions of the globe \nthis is probably not the case: indeed, Rotty [1987] determined a \nseasonality in the northern hemisphere of 18%, while Levin et al., \n[1989], based on 14C measurements, i ferred an even larger sea- \nused the same 0.5\u00f8x0.5 \u00f8 horizontal grid. The climate used to drive sonality n northern Europe. It is expected that fossil fuel use for \nthe models is based on the precipitation, temperature, and cloudi- ' heating in winter (in higher latitudes) and for cooling in summer (in \nness data sets of Cramer and Leemans [W. Cramer, personal corn- lower latitudes) induces a easonal release pattern. However, these \nmunication, 1994], which is an updated version of the Leeroans \nand Cramer [1991] database. These data are long-term average \nmonthly mean values and are given on a 0.5 \u00f8 grid for the entire \nland surface (without Antarctica). If necessary, the monthly values \nwere interpolated to daily and hourly timesteps using simple inter- \npolation schemes and periodic functions as described in \nsection 2.3. \nAll fluxes are calculated for potential vegetation (disregarding \nhuman influences) except for the SDBM1 which implicitly in- \ncludes land use through its application of satellite data (NDVI). \nThe descriptions of the pattern of vegetation types (biomes) and \nsoil characteristics (soil type and texture) are different in each \nmodel, though all soil data layers used here are based on the FAO \nsoil map of the world [Food and Agriculture Organization, 1971- \n1979]. Vegetation distribution is either taken from observation- \nbased maps or derived from climate (BIaME2, HRBM, and SIL- \nVAN, see sections 2.3.1, 2.3.3, 2.3.5.). \n3.2. Observations of the Atmospheric CO 2 Concentration \nAtmospheric observations of the ca 2 concentration used in the \npresent study were obtained from the comprehensive monitoring \nprogram of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Admin- \nistration. This network consists of approximately 30 stations cov- \nering latitudes from 82\u00f8N to 90\u00f8S, with the highest density of \nstations in the Americas, in Antarctica, and on Pacific islands and \nthe biggest gaps over the Eurasian and African continents [Conway \net al., 1994a]. We used the monthly averaged station data provided \nby the Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center [Conway \net al., 1994b]. \nsources typically contribute only about one third to the total indus- \ntrial ca 2 emissions, which themselves are substantially smaller \nthan the seasonal fluxes of interest in this study. On the basis of \nthese considerations we do not expect the assumption of constant \nindustrial ca 2 emissions to significantly affect the modeled re- \nsults. \n4. Results \nTo evaluate how well a simulation reproduced the observed sea- \nsonal signal of atmospheric ca 2 at a monitoring station, we calcu- \nlated a normalized mean-squared eviation (NMSD) defined as \n( _ )2 \u20222 12 + CF ' + Co ' COBS, m NMSD = \u2022 ,CT, rn rn rn rn-! Orn (15) \nwhere CT, m, CF,m, and Co, m are the monthly ca 2 concentrations \nresulting from the corresponding biospheric, fossil fuel, and ocean \nflux, respectively, COBS, rnis the 10-year-mean observed value \n(1983-1992), and o m is the corresponding standard eviation of \nthe observed value for each month (m= 1 ..... 12) of the year.

Locations of the 27 CO 2 monitoring stations considered in this study [Conway et al., 1994b]. The two solid \nlines delineate the middle and high-latitude northern, tropical (30\u00f8S - 30\u00f8N) and midlatitude southern source regions \nfrom which the contributions to the seasonal station signals were computed with the Simple Diagnostic Biosphere \nModel (SDBM1) (see Plate 1). \nsources and sinks of CO 2 throughout the terrestrial biosphere. The \nglobal parameters in the NPP (Ix) and R H (Q]o) relationships of \nSDBM1 have been calibrated such that the simulated seasonal sig- \nnal of atmospheric CO 2 represents a good fit to the seasonal signals \nmeasured at 5 of the 27 monitoring stations. As described by Knorr \nand Heimann [1995], the five calibration stations were selected to \ncover approximately uniformly the major regions in the northern \nhemisphere temperate latitudes with strongly seasonal vegetation \n(see Table 2). Not surprisingly, the agreement between the SDBM1 \nsimulations and the observed seasonal signals is good at most sta- \ntions: the median NMSD among the 27 stations is 1.7 and the range \nof NMSD is between 0.3 and 8.4 (Table 3). Exceptions are Station \n\"M\" (STM), Cold Bay (CBA), Shemya Island (SHM), and Cape \nGrim (CGa), where the normalized mean-squared eviation \n(NMSD) is greater than 5 (Table 3). At STM there is close agree- \nment between the model simulations and the observations, but be- \ncause of the small standard deviation of the observations at this \nstation (approximately 0.5 ppmv), the NMSD is large. At CBA and \nSHM the simulation differs moderately from the measured signal, \nespecially in June and July. At Cape Grim (CGa) the simulation \ndiffers substantially from the observations, which may be attribut- \ned in part to the fact that in the transport model the Cape Grim lo- \ncation lies in a grid box with a substantial land surface area, which \nimplies that the simulated signal at the station is largely dominated \nby the local sources. However, the observations, in order to be rep- \nresentative of southern hemisphere background air, are selected ac- \ncording to wind direction and wind speed. This inconsistency is\nresponsible for a large fraction of the discrepancy at this station \n[Ramonet and Monfray, 1996]. \nFor the terrestrial biosphere the SDBM1 estimates both an an- \nnual NPP and an annual R H of 60.0 Pg C (1015 gC). In the context \nof simulating the seasonal signal of atmospheric CO 2, the temporal \npattern of NEP at any spatial scale is more relevant han the abso- \nlute values of NPP and RH; NPP and R H estimates could be biased \neither high or low and still produce a good fit to the seasonal signal \nof CO 2 at the monitoring stations [Knorr and Heimann, 1995, Fig- \nure 1]. \nThe SDBM1 simulation is useful in identifying the relative con- \ntributions of fossil fuel emissions, oceanic CO 2 exchange, and ter- \nrestrial CO 2 exchange in controlling the seasonal signal of \natmospheric ca 2 at the monitoring stations. To evaluate these rel- \native contributions, we ran the model with each of the different \nsource components eparately. In order to separate ffects of the \nmiddle and high latitudes versus the tropics, we also performed an \natmospheric transport model simulation with the SDBM1 fluxes \nfrom the latitudes north of 30\u00f8N, 30\u00f8S-30\u00f8N, and south of 30\u00f8S \nonly. \nPlate 1 shows the relative contributions to the seasonal signal of \nCO 2 at nine monitoring stations that occur at different latitudes: \nAlert (ALT, 83\u00f8N); Shemya Island (SHM, 53\u00f8N); Midway (MID, \n28\u00f8N); Cape Kumukahi (KUM, 20\u00f8N); Christmas Island (CHR, \n2\u00f8N); Samoa (SMO, 14\u00f8S); Amsterdam Island (AMS, 38\u00f8S); \nPalmer Station (PSA, 65\u00f8S); and south pole (sPa, 90\u00f8S). At the \nthree northernmost stations (ALT, SHM, and MID) the seasonal \nsignal of atmospheric CO 2 is controlled almost entirely by CO 2 ex- \nchange of the terrestrial biosphere north of 30\u00f8N; fossil fuel emis- \nsions, oceanic exchange, and terrestrial exchange south of 30\u00f8N \nhave little effect on the seasonal dynamics of atmospheric CO 2. \nThe exchange of CO 2 between the atmosphere and the northern ter- \nrestrial biosphere plays a large role in the seasonal dynamics of \nca 2 at northern stations because much of the global land mass lies \nnorth of 30\u00f8N (43%, excluding Antarctica) and NEP is highly sea- \nsonal in this region. The effect of the exchange is so strong that the \npeak-to-peak amplitude measured at northern stations varies be- \ntween approximately 8 ppmv and 12 ppmv, with greater amplitude \nat more northern stations. \nThe control of the terrestrial biosphere on the seasonal signal of \nstations in the tropics diminishes from north to south (Plate 1).

Close \nto the equator, the seasonal signal of CO 2 at Christmas Island is \nstill dominated by terrestrial exchanges, although seasonal varia- \ntions in atmospheric transport induce a substantial seasonal signal \nfrom the fossil fuel source [Heimann et al., 1989]. In contrast, the \nseasonal signal at Samoa, which is located in the southern tropics, \nis controlled approximately equally by fossil fuel emissions and \noceanic exchange and northern terrestrial exchange, the latter now \nshows a 6-month phase shift leading to a relative maximum in Au- \ngust; tropical and southern terrestrial exchange has little effect on \nseasonal dynamics of atmospheric CO 2 at this station. Although \nmuch of the global land mass occurs between latitudes 30\u00f8N and \n30\u00f8S (45%), the SDBM1 simulation indicates that NEP is highly \naseasonal in the tropics, so that the northern terrestrial biosphere \nexchange still plays a role in the northern tropics but has little ef- \nfect in the southern tropics. The diminishing role, from north to \nsouth, of the atmospheric exchange with northern terrestrial bio- \nsphere in controlling the seasonal signal of CO 2 in the tropics is \nalso reflected in the peak-to-peak amplitude, which is approxi- \nmately 8 ppmv at Cape Kumukahi, 4 ppmv at Christmas Island, \nand 2 ppmv at Samoa. \nAt the three southernmost stations (AMS, PSA, and SPO) the \nseasonal signal of CO 2 is largely controlled by the difference be- \ntween oceanic exchange and the combination of terrestrial ex- \nchange and fossil fuel emissions (Plate 1). Oceanic exchange of \nCO 2 with the atmosphere isimportant in the southern latitudes be- \n16 HEIMANN ET AL.: EVALUATION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS \n90N ' \n6ON' \n30N \nEQ \n30S \n60S ' \n90S \nBIOME2 \n....... i 'l ............ \u2022 ...... \u2022 .... \nOCT JUL \nRH \n90N ...... \n60N \n30N \nEO \n30S \n60S \n90S I I, ....

The effects \nof terrestrial exchange and fossil fuel emissions on the seasonal \nsignal of CO 2, although small in southern latitudes, are generally \nin phase with each other and out of phase with the effects of oce- \nanic exchange. Even at the south pole the biospheric signals from \nthe northern, tropical, and southern regions are of similar magni- \ntude and are in phase, such that the total biospheric signal is of the \nsame size as the oceanic signal. Because the effects of oceanic ex- \nchange tend to cancel the effects of terrestrial exchange and fossil \nfuel emissions, the peak-to-peak amplitude of CO 2 at southern sta- \ntions is less than 2 ppmv. \nThe fact that in the southern hemisphere south of 30\u00f8S the oce- \nanic contribution to the seasonal signal is of similar magnitude as \nthe terrestrial contributions makes these locations less suited as \nvalidation sites for the modeled seasonal terrestrial CO 2 exchang- \nes. Pending accurate techniques to separate the terrestrial from the \noceanic signals in the observations (e.g., concurrent 13C\/12C or\nO2\/N 2 measurements), any discrepancy between simulation and \nobservation could equally well be ascribed to errors in terrestrial or \noceanic (or a combination of both) exchange formulations. The \nmain constraint provided by the stations south of 30\u00f8S is a bound \non the seasonal amplitude which must be smaller than about \n2 ppmv (peak to peak) [Knorr and Heimann, 1995]. \n4.2. Comparisons to CO 2 Monitoring Stations: \nThe Five Prognostic TBMs \nEstimates of annual NPP and of annual R H for the terrestrial bio- \nsphere by the five prognostic TBMs in this study range from 46.4 \nPg C to 61.0 Pg C (FBM, 50.3; HRBM, 46.4; BIOME2 56.6; SIL- \nVAN, 61.0; TEM, 49.0; see Table 1). Because controls of the sea- \nsonal signal of CO 2 vary latitudinally, we analyze the performance \nof the TBMs in simulating the seasonal signal of CO 2 separately \nfor northern, tropical, and southern monitoring stations. \n4.2.1. Northern stations. At the twelve monitoring stations \nthat occur between latitudes 83\u00f8N and 26\u00f8N (ALT, MBC, KTL, \nBRW, STM, CBA, SHM, CMO, AZR, NWR, MID, and KEY), the \nsimulations of the TBMs generally capture the seasonal placement \nof winter maxima and summer minima in the atmospheric CO 2 sig- \nnature (Plate 2a), but the phasing of the seasonal signal differs \namong models. In comparison to the observed seasonal signal of \nCO 2 at each station, the HRBM and BIOME2 simulations consis- \ntently estimate early drawdown and early recovery of atmospheric \nCO 2. The TEM simulation tends to estimate early drawdown and \nearly recovery at the four northernmost stations (ALT, MBC, KTL, \nand BRW) but estimates approximately synchronous drawdown \nand recovery for the other eight stations. The drawdown of CO 2 es- \ntimated by the FBM simulation is approximately synchronous for \nall the stations, but similar to the TEM simulation, the recovery is \nearly for the four northernmost stations and synchronous for the \nother eight stations. The SILVAN simulation tends to estimate late \ndrawdown for all stations and late recovery at the eight southern- \nmost stations; the recovery at the four northernmost stations is ap- \nproximately synchronous. All of the simulations tend to \nunderestimate the magnitude of the drawdown for the northern sta- \ntions, with the HRBM and BIOME2 simulations generally indicat- \ning the greatest degree of underestimation and the SILVAN \nsimulation generally indicating the least amount of underestima- \ntion. \nOn the basis of the NMSD index the simulations differ in their \nfits to the seasonal signal of CO 2 among the 12 northern stations \n(Figure 3a; Kruskal-Wallis test, H = 13.8, P -- 0.008, and d.f. (de- \ngrees of freedom) -- 4). Pairwise multiple comparisons (Student- \nNewman-Keuls, P < 0.05) indicate that the fits of the FBM (median \nis 7.6), SILVAN (median is 8.5), and TEM (median is 6.0) simula- \ntions are not statistically different from each other but are statisti- \ncally different from the fits of the HRBM (median is15.8) and \nBIOME2 (median is 13.0) simulations; the fits of the HRBM and \nBIOME2 simulations are statistically indistinguishable. \n4.2.2. Tropical stations. Nine monitoring stations occur in \nthe tropics between latitudes 20\u00f8N and 14\u00f8S (Plate 2b; MLO, \nKUM, GMI, AVI, RPB, CHR, SEY, ASC, and SMO). Three of the \nstations occur in the northern tropical Pacific Ocean (MLO, KUM, \nand GMI), two occur in the northeast tropical Atlantic Ocean (AVI \nand RPB), and four occur near or south of the equator (CHR, SEY, \nASC, and SMO). At the three Pacific stations in the northern trop- \nics the HRBM and BIOME2 simulations tend to estimate early \ndrawdown and recovery of atmospheric CO 2. In contrast, he SIL- \nVAN simulation estimates late drawdown and recovery. The \nHRBM, BIOME2, and SILVAN simulations tend to underestimate \nthe degree of drawdown at the three sites. Recovery also is under- \nestimated by the three simulations, except for the SILVAN simu- \nlation at Guam. For both the FBM and TEM simulations both the \ntiming and the degree of drawdown and recovery are similar to the \nobserved signal. \nAt the two Atlantic stations in the northern tropics the SILVAN \nsimulation estimates late drawdown and recovery of atmospheric \nCO2; the other simulations are more or less synchronous with the \nobserved signal. Both the BIOME2 and SILVAN simulations tend \nto underestimate the degree of drawdown at both stations. The \nBIOME2 simulation also underestimates the degree of recovery. In \ncontrast, the TEM simulation tends to overestimate the degree of \nrecovery at both stations and overestimates the degree of draw- \ndown at RPB. The FBM simulation tends to overestimate recovery \nat RPB. Both the timing and degree of drawdown and recovery of \nthe HRBM simulation are similar to the observed signal at the two \nstations. \nAt each of the tropical stations near or south of the equator, the \npattern of simulations are unique. At Christmas Island all of the \nsimulations, except for HRBM, tend to estimate early drawdown \nand early recovery. The SILVAN and TEM simulations tend to \noverestimate the degree of recovery. At Seychelles all of the simu- \nlations, except for SILVAN, tend to estimate synchronous draw- \ndown and recovery in comparison with the observed signal' the \nSILVAN simulation indicates late drawdown and recovery. The \ndegree of drawdown and recovery is similar to that of the observed \nsignal for all simulations, mostly because at this site the seasonal \nmonsoon circulation generates alarge seasonal signal from the fos- \nsil fuel source [Heimann et al., 1989]. At Ascension Island all of \nthe simulations estimate late drawdown and late recovery in com- \nparison to the observed signal. The HRBM simulation overpredicts \nrecovery and the FBM, TEM, and SILVAN simulations overesti- \nmate the degree of both drawdown and recovery. All TBMs tend to \noverpredict the observed peak-to-peak variation by a factor of 2. At \nSamoa the FBM, TEM, and HRBM simulations estimate early \ndrawdown and recovery, while the SILVAN simulation estimates \nlate drawdown and recovery. The FBM, SILVAN, and TEM sim- \nulations also overestimate the degree of drawdown and recovery in \ncomparison to the observed signal. \nFor the tropical stations the median NMSD indices for the sim- \nulations range from 2.4 to 19.9 (FBM, 6.6; HRBM, 2.4; BIOME2, \n4.6; SILVAN, 19.9; and TEM, 4.0).

A power analysis for a one- \nway analysis of variance indicates that the power to detect differ- \nences is low (0.36 versus desired 0.80). \n4.2.3. Southern stations. At the six monitoring stations that \noccur between latitudes 38\u00f8S and 90\u00f8S (AMS, CGO, SYO, PSA, \nHBA, and SPO), the simulations ofthe TBMs do not generally cap- \nture the seasonal placement of winter and summer maxima in the \natmospheric CO 2 signature (Plate 2c). The BIOME2 and SILVAN \nsimulations are consistently approximately 180 \u00f8 out of phase with \nthe observed seasonal signal at all stations. The other three simula- \ntions all estimate late drawdown and recovery in comparison to the \nobserved seasonal signal; the FBM and TEM simulations are ap- \nproximately in phase with each other and are later than the HRBM \nsimulation. The degree of drawdown and recovery are consistently \noverestimated by the FBM, SILVAN, and TEM simulations. The \ndegree of drawdown and recovery estimated by the HRBM and \nBIOME2 simulations are similar to the observed seasonal signal of \nCO 2 at the six stations. \nOn the basis of the NMSD index the simulations differ in their \nfits to the seasonal signal of CO2 among the six southern stations \n(Figure 3c; Kruskal-Wallis test, H -- 9.51, P -- 0.0495, and d.f. -- 4). \nPairwise multiple comparisons (Student-Newman-Keuls, P < 0.05) \nindicate that fits of the FBM (median is 7.6), BIOME2 (median is \n9.7), SILVAN (median is 27.0), and TEM (median is 14.9) simula- \ntions are not statistically different from each other but are statisti- \ncally different from the fits of the HRBM simulation (median is \n2.8). \n4.3.

The box \nplots indicate the median, 25th, and 75th percentile and 10th and \n90th percentile intervals. \n20 HEIMANN ET AL.: EVALUATION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS \nBIOME2 (median is 11.0), SILVAN (median is 10.0), and TEM \n(median is 6.7) simulations are not statistically different from each \nother but are statistically different from the SDBM1 simulation \n(median is 1.7). The SDBM1 simulation indicates that control of \nthe terrestrial biosphere over the seasonal dynamics of CO 2 in the \natmosphere diminishes from north to south and suggests that NEP \nis highly seasonal in northern regions and highly aseasonal introp- \nical regions. Because of the singularly close fit of the SDBM1 sim- \nulation to the seasonal signature of CO 2 at the monitoring stations, \nthe latitudinal-seasonal p ttern of NEP estimated by the SDBM1 is \na useful standard for comparison to the other TBMs. However, it is \nimportant o keep in mind that the simulations with the SDBM1 do \nnot include CO 2 exchanges caused by land use (e.g., biomass burn- \ning). \nFor northern regions of the terrestrial biosphere, the SDBM1 in- \ndicates that NEP is highly seasonal (Plate 3a). All of the five prog- \nnostic models also indicate that northern regions are highly \nseasonal, but the magnitude and timing of CO 2 uptake and release \nby the terrestrial biosphere differs among the models. The maxi- \nmum uptake of CO 2 in the northern terrestrial biosphere stimated \nby FBM, HRBM, and TEM is similar to the maximum uptake es- \ntimated by the SDBM1, but the timing of maximum uptake tends \nto be earlier, and the growing season appears to be shorter in com- \nparison to the SDBM1. The release of CO 2 to the atmosphere esti- \nmated by the three models during the winter is less than that \nestimated by the SDBM1. The timing of maximum uptake of CO 2 \nestimated by the SILVAN model is later than that of the SDBM1, \nbut the magnitude of uptake appears to be similar. The release of \nCO 2 estimated by the SILVAN model is similar to that estimated \nby the SDBM1. In comparison to the SDBM1 the BIOME2 model \nestimates less release of CO 2 to the atmosphere during winter; the \ntiming of uptake is earlier, and the magnitude of uptake is smaller. \nThus, although the estimates of the prognostic models and the \nSDBM1 agree that NEP in the northern terrestrial biosphere is \nhighly seasonal, the prognostic models differ from the SDBM1 in \nthe magnitude and\/or timing of CO 2 exchange with the atmosphere \nin this region. \nFor tropical regions of the terrestrial biosphere the SDBM1 in- \ndicates that the seasonality of NEP is much less pronounced than \nin northern regions (Plate 3a). In contrast, the NEP estimates of all \nfive prognostic models are highly seasonal. The maximum uptake \nof CO 2 in the tropical terrestrial biosphere stimated by the FBM, \nHRBM, SILVAN, and TEM is greater than the maximum uptake \nestimated by the SDBM1. The maximum uptake estimated by the \nBIOME2 model is similar to that of the SDBM1 in the northern \ntropics but is greater in the southern tropics. All five of the prog- \nnostic TBMs estimate substantial release of CO 2 to the atmosphere \nduring the tropical dry season; the estimated releases are most pro- \nnounced for the FBM, HRBM, and TEM. In general, seasonality of \nNPP in the tropics differs more between the prognostic and diag- \nnostic models than does the seasonality of R H (Plates 3b and 3c). \nFor southern regions of the terrestrial biosphere, the SDBM1 in- \ndicates that NEP is highly seasonal (Plate 3a). All of the prognostic \nTBMs estimate that the uptake of CO 2 from the atmosphere occurs \nbetween October and April, which is generally in agreement with \nthe SDBM1 estimates. The FBM and HRBM estimates indicate \nhigher maximum uptake of CO 2 than the SDBM1 estimates, and \nthe BIOME2, SILVAN, and TEM estimates indicate lower maxi- \nmum uptake of CO 2. In comparison to the SDBM1 the estimated \nrelease of CO 2 to the atmosphere is extended in the FBM and \nHRBM estimates; the timing and magnitude of CO 2 releases esti- \nmated by the other three models are similar to the SDBM1 in the \nsouthern portions of the terrestrial biosphere. \n5. Discussion and Conclusions \nThe simulations with the diagnostic model SDBM1, which is \ntuned to the atmospheric CO 2 seasonal signal at five monitoring \nstations in the northern hemisphere, successfully reproduced the \nseasonal signal of CO 2 at the other monitoring stations. The addi- \ntional simulation experiments with the SDBM1 source split among \ntropics and extratropical atitudes demonstrate that the seasonal \nsignal both north and within the tropics is dominated by the ex- \nchanges with the terrestrial biosphere. In southern latitudes, how- \never, ocean-atmosphere gas exchange contributes ignificantly to \nthe seasonal signal of CO 2. \nAmong the 27 monitoring stations the NMSD (equation (15)) of \nthe SDBM1 simulation was greater than 5 at only four of the sta- \ntions (Station M, Cold Bay, Shemya, and Cape Grim). Several as- \npects of the methodology of the present study may be responsible \nfor the differences. First, there is uncertainty as to how well the at- \nmospheric tracer transport model (TM2) performs at high northern \nlatitudes. Poor performance of TM2 at northern latitudes might ex- \nplain the poorer fits at Station M, Cold Bay, and Shemya. Second, \nour assumption of time invariant fossil fuel emissions may be inac- \ncurate. For instance, Levin et al. [1989] found that the seasonality \nof the fossil fuel flux from Europe is about 3 times higher than the \nseasonality estimated from emission statistics. This might contrib- \nute to the seasonal signal observed at Station M. Third, errors in the \nsimulated ocean exchange with the atmosphere may become im- \nportant in the southern hemisphere. It should also be recognized \nthat we' have not included in our analyses biomass burning nor the \nglobal terrestrial sink which can be inferred from the global budget \nof atmospheric CO 2 [Schimel et al., 1995]. Some noticeable ffects \nfrom tropical vegetation fires may be expected at AVI, RPB, and \nASC according to a study by Iacobellis et al. [1994]. Vegetation \nfires in the tropics and subtropics are expected to occur primarily \nduring the dry season when NPP is reduced because of water stress. \nHence if vegetation fires make up for a significant atmospheric sig- \nnal in atmospheric CO 2, then our analysis, which neglected this ad- \nditional flux, should result in an underestimation of the amplitude \nof the seasonal signal. These additional effects are difficult to \nquantify, however, because of an uncertain database on the CO 2 re- \nlease from vegetation fires and the subsequent uptake by regrowing \nvegetation. Another explanation for differences may be the use of \n1987 wind fields in TM2 which may not be representative for the \nentire period of CO 2 measurements (1983-1992); in a sensitivity \nstudy, Knorr and Heimann [1995, Table 2] documented a 15% \nchange in the overall agreement when using wind data from 1986. \nFinally, because we compare model output of TM2 at approxi- \nmately 7.83 \u00f8 by 10 \u00f8 resolution with point station measurements, \nwe potentially neglect the influence of local sources. \nThere are several aspects of the SDBM1 extrapolations for NPP \nand R H that may influence the fit between the SDBM1 simulations \nand the observations. First, the use of constant global light use ef- \nficiency and Q values is clearly an oversimplification [Ruimy et lO \nal.,1994]. Also, the use of monthly maximum NDVI from a 5-year \nperiod in the SDBM simulations may not be representative for the \nentire period of CO 2 measurements. Finally, because the SDBM1 \ncalculates fluxes at monthly temporal resolution, there may be \nHEIMANN ET AL.: EVALUATION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS 21 \nphase differences of up to two 2 between simulated and observed \nsignals. \nEven though there are a number of concerns that could influence \nthe fit of the SDBM1 simulations with the observed seasonal signal \nof atmospheric CO 2, the simulation with the diagnostic model sig- \nnificantly fits the seasonal signal better than any of the simulations \nwith the prognostic TBMs. Only at Cape Grim did simulations with \nprognostic TBMs produce smaller NMSD values than the SDBM1 \nsimulation (see Table 3), which, however, may be a coincidence \nconsidering the problem of data selection at this site as discussed \nin section 4.1. The most likely explanation for the different fits to \nthe observed ata is the use of phenology algorithms in the prog- \nnostic models versus the use of NDVI which essentially defines \nphenology in the diagnostic model. The variability in phase of the \nseasonal cycle among simulations with prognostic models is pre- \nsumably caused by variation in the phenology algorithms of the \nmodels. An additional, although minor source of variability among \nthe prognostic TBMs may be due to different vegetation maps and \ndifferent echniques to interpolate the monthly climate variables to \nthe time resolution of the model. It must also be recognized that the \nuse of NDVI in the diagnostic model implicitly may partially ac- \ncount for the effects of land use on terrestrial CO 2 exchange. In \ncontrast, the prognostic models use potential vegetation hence do \nnot consider land use. However, preliminary sensitivity simula- \ntions in which the prognostic models masked out agriculturally \nused land pixels showed only very small differences in the seasonal \ncycle at the monitoring stations as compared to the base simulation. \nThe fits of the prognostic simulations depend on the region of \nthe globe. At the northern stations all models tend to underestimate \nthe seasonal amplitude and, in general, predict early drawdown and \nrecovery. However, the general phasing of the northern hemi- \nsphere CO 2 concentration with a minimum in late summer and a \nmaximum in spring is captured by all models. One hypothesis to \nexplain the underestimation ofthe seasonal amplitude is that all the \nmodels predict in high latitudes a too strong seasonality of het- \nerotrophic respiration, which, in these regions, is controlled prima- \nrily by the annual cycle of temperature. This defect might be due to \nthe fact that the TBMs implement base metabolic rates of soil de- \ncomposition that have no temperature dependence. Emerging data \nindicate that the base metabolic rate of decomposition above 10\u00f8C \nis much higher than below 10\u00f8C (J. M. Melillo, unpublished ata \n1996; K. J. Nadelhoffer, unpublished data, 1996), that is, there ap- \npears to be a threshold temperature for base metabolic rates. \nThe consistently underestimated seasonal amplitude generated \nby B IOME2 throughout the entire northern hemisphere stations is \nattributed in part to a too strong seasonality in heterotrophic respi- \nration which is generated from the Howard and Howard [1993] \nformulation and which hence cancels a too large fraction of the sea- \nsonal drawdown of CO 2 by the modeled NPP. \nThe relatively late drawdown of SILVAN in the northern lati- \ntudes results from the maximal NPP being late compared to the \nother models (Plate 3). In the temperate and boreal biomes the phe- \nnology of leaves as a function of the date of the year in SILVAN is \ndetermined onthe basis of heat sums and not on the basis of poten- \ntial NPP computed from concurrent climate and vegetation state. \nThis appears to lead to a later bud burst and thus to later NPP sim- \nulated by SILVAN than as simulated by the other models in the \nnorthern latitudes. \nAt the tropical and southern stations the differences in the fits of \nthe prognostic and diagnostic models generally become larger \nfrom north to south. For example, at Ascension Island (ASC, \n7\u00f855'S), located in the tropical Atlantic, all the prognostic models \nconsistently overpredict the observed seasonality, most prominent- \nly seen in the large peak appearing during November and Decem- \nber. The seasonal cycle at this station is primarily influenced by \nseasonal terrestrial CO 2 exchanges in tropical southern Africa and \nSouth America [Kaminski et al., 1996]. \nOne hypothesis toexplain the overestimation f CO 2 release of \nthe terrestrial biosphere during the dry period in the tropical re- \ngions is that none of the TBMs allow tropical trees access to deep \nsoil water. In some regions of the tropics, evergreen forests have \nbeen able to maintain evapotranspiration during 5-month dry peri- \nods by absorbing water from soil depths of more than 8 m [Nepstad \net al., 1994]. The TBMs in this study have rooting zones for tropi- \ncal forests that range from 1 m to 3 m, depending on the model. The \nuse of NDVI by the SDBM1 to some extent implicitly accounts for \nthe effects of deep rooting on phenology. Furthermore, since in the \nSDBM1 the same water stress factor is applied on the formulations \nof NPP and R H, its effects on the resulting net seasonal CO 2 flux is \nminimized. \nAnother hypothesis to explain differences in the latitudinal-sea- \nsonal pattern of NEP between the estimates of the prognostic \nTBMs and the SDBM1 in the tropics is that plant respiration is \noverestimated by the prognostic TBMs. Uncertainty in respiration \nbudgets occurs because there is poor information on the relative \namounts of actively respiring plant tissue (leaves, fine roots, and \nsapwood) and inactive plant tissue (heartwood and coarse roots). \nIn SILVAN the delay of the seasonal cycle by approximately 2 \nmonths in tropical atitudes appears to be caused by the relatively \nearly reduction of heterotrophic respiration (see Plate 3, compare \nSILVAN with SDBM) as a result of the reduced precipitation dur- \ning the dry season. Hence the accumulated litter from the previous \ngrowing season tends to be preserved until the onset of the follow- \ning rainy season, when it is respired, yielding a large pulse which \ntends to delay the concurrent drawdown of the CO 2 concentration \nby new production. \nIt is difficult to attribute the large differences between the fits of \nthe prognostic and diagnostic models in southern regions to partic- \nular deficiencies in model formulations or particular problem ar- \neas. However, a thorough investigation is not warranted in this \nregion because, as discussed in section 4.1., the northern hemi- \nsphere middle and high latitudes, the tropics and the southern \nhemisphere midlatitudes, and also the ocean component contribute \nabout equally to the seasonal signal. Furthermore, the signals in the \nsouthern hemisphere midlatitudes are small and show substantial \ninterannual variations. In the future, high-precision stable isotope \ndata (13C\/12C) might provide an additional tool to discriminate be- \ntween the different contributions. \nIn a similar study, Hunt et al. [ 1996] have used a description of \nactual vegetation to compare the simulated seasonal signal of CO 2 \nwith the BIOME-BGC model, driven by 1987 weather data [Piper \nand Stewart, 1996], to the measured CO 2 signal for the year 1987. \nAlso, they derived annual maximum LAI from 1987 NDVI data \nand used this maximum LAI to initialize the carbon and nitrogen \npools. In our study we have used potential vegetation to make the \ncomparison of the simulated seasonal signal of each of five prog- \nnostic TBMs, driven by a long-term average climate, to the average \nseasonal signal of the period 1983-1992. Although the nature of the \ncomparisons are somewhat different, the analyses presented here \nand by Hunt et al. [ 1996] are important for evaluating the dynamics \n22 HElMANN ET AL.: EVALUATION OF TERRESTRIAL CARBON CYCLE MODELS \nof global TBMs and for gaining further insight into the biosphere's \nrole in controlling the seasonal signal of atmospheric CO 2 concen- \ntration. The differences in the predictions by the five models will \nbe further analyzed by developing amodularized Community Ter- \nrestrial Biosphere Model which allows us to combine modules \nfrom the different TBMs. \nThe study forms part of the Electric Power Research Institute \nCarbon Cycle Model Linkage Project, which is using comprehen- \nsive models including terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric compo- \nnents to analyze the dynamics of the global carbon cycle during the \nhistorical (fossil fuel) and contemporary periods and to examine \nthe response of the carbon cycle to different scenarios of future \nemissions. In the present analysis, interannual variability and sec- \nular trends were factored out so as to test the ability of current \nTBMs to simulate one specific aspect of the contemporary carbon \ncycle, that is, the seasonal cycle of CO 2 concentrations in the atmo- \nsphere. Simulations with the prognostic TBMs successfully repro- \nduced aspects of the seasonal signal of atmospheric CO 2 which \ncould not be anticipated because these models were not calibrated \nto the atmospheric CO 2 signal. We consider this demonstration es- \nsential to establish the usefulness of TBMs for subsequent analyses \nin which we will relax the assumption of equilibrium in the terres- \ntrial carbon balance and take into account the physiological effects \nof CO 2 increase, climate variability, and climate change. \nAcknowledgments.
