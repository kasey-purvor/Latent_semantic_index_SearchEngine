Commensurate to the size of the industry is a growth in the \nnumber of students pursuing degree courses in tourism around the world. Despite an \nincreasingly sophisticated literature, the relative recency of the industry and its study has \nmeant little attention has been paid in the ethics literature to the dilemmas facing tourism \nmanagers and its students. Based on interviews with senior members of the tourism \nindustry six scenarios are developed with pertinence to the challenges faced by industry \npractitioners today. This paper then applies the Multidimensional Ethics Scale \n(Reidenbach and Robin, 1990) to tourism students at three prominent universities in the \nUK, Canada and Australia. In total, 438 responses are achieved. The results have \nimportance for the instruction of tourism students for the future, but also in informing \ndecisions about the tools tourism destinations can effectively employ to control the future \ndirection of the industry.  \n \nKey words: Tourism, Students, Multi-Dimensional Ethics Scale\nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 3 \n Ethical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nMuch research has been conducted on the ethical awareness and orientation displayed by \nstudents studying a range of subject disciplines (Freedman and Bartholemew, 1990; \nSmall, 1992; Okleshen and Hoyt, 1996; Kaynama, King and Smith, 1996; Smith and \nOakley, 1997; Cohen, Pant and Sharp, 2001; Stevens, 2001; Kracher, Chatterjee and \nLundquist, 2002). Such research has enabled discussion on the necessary future levels of \nethical training (Singh, 1989), the way such training should be delivered (Woods and \nBerger, 1989), the implications for organisational recruitment and selection (Stevens, \n2001), the importance of organisational socialisation, and the value of tools, such as \ncodes of ethics, as a way to ensure consistent standards of professionalism (Cleek and \nLeonard, 1998).  \nHowever, while some studies have examined the ethical orientation of hospitality \nstudents (Pizam and Lewis, 1979; Whitney, 1989; Freedman and Bartholomew, 1990; \nStevens, 2001), no research has been conducted to date on either the ethical perspectives, \nor the decision making approaches of tourism students. This paper aims to address this \nshortcoming by measuring both ethical awareness and orientation of a sample of tourism \nstudents in three different countries through the application of the Multidimensional \nEthics Scale (MES). The structure of the paper is as follows. Initially, the links between \ntourism, ethics and corporate responsibility are explored. The paper then presents a \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 4 \nframework for ethical decision making \u2013 a framework that can be tested using the MES \nscale. Previous theory suggests that there are a number of possible influences on ethical \ndecision making of students: nationality or culture, the type of ethical dilemma faced, \nprior ethical education, and gender. These are discussed in turn, and a general hypothesis \nis developed from this theory. The paper then presents an empirical study that examines \nthe ethical awareness and orientation of tourism students in three major educational \ninstitutions in the UK, Canada, and Australia.  \n \nEthics and tourism \n \nThe substantial growth of tourism activity clearly marks tourism as one of the most \nremarkable economic and social phenomena of the past century. The number of \ninternational arrivals shows an evolution from a mere 25 million international arrivals in \n1950 to over 700 million in 2002, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of 6.6 \npercent (World Tourism Organization, 2005). In addition to the numerical growth of \ntourism, there has been an increasing geographic spread of tourism to encompass almost \nall the reaches of the globe. Simultaneously, there has been a diversification of the \ntourism product from the traditional sun, sea and sand offering to a product that can be \npotentially more intrusive, or more beneficial for those living in the tourism destination. \nTourism\u2019s expansion has meant the industry now represents the leading source of foreign \nexchange in at least 38% of countries, and ranks in the top five industries for exports in \n83% of countries (WTO, 2005).  \n \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 5 \nHowever, in addition to the oft-cited economic indicators displaying the dominance of \nthe tourism industry, there has been a commensurate and almost equally well-publicised \nrise and recognition of the potentially negative impacts of the burgeoning tourism \nindustry (Archer, Cooper and Ruhanen, 2005). Researchers have been critical of the \npernicious social and environmental impacts the industry can have from reinforcing \nwestern domination over developing countries through the \u2018host\/guest\u2019 relationship \n(Smith and Brent, 2001) to the visual scars on the landscape caused by ski resorts or golf \ncourses (Hudson, 2000). This has led to calls for the industry to exercise greater \nresponsibility and \u201cprofessionalism\u201d (Sheldon, 1989) in order to protect the \u201cgolden \ngoose\u201d (Manning and Dougherty, 1995) and mirrors the arguments for greater corporate \nand social responsibility in other industries (Webley, 1999; Rondinelli and Berry, 2000; \nHuberman-Arnold and Arnold, 2001; Miller, 2001).  \n \nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a specific application of the notion of \nenvironmental and social auditing to business practice. The technique is strongly \npromoted by Fair Trade in Tourism (2000) which suggests that the technique of CSR \nemerged in the late 1990s out of NGO efforts to create a more equitable international \ntrade system. According to Mowforth and Munt (2003) the tourism industry is well  \nbehind other industries in terms of CSR, and the absence of ethical leadership in the \ntourism industry has been \u2018astounding\u2019(p.168). However, in the last few decades, \nresponsible tourism has emerged as a significant trend in the western world, as wider \nconsumer market trends towards lifestyle marketing and ethical consumption have spread \nto tourism (Goodwin and Francis, 2003). Tourism organizations are beginning to realize \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 6 \nthat promoting their ethical stance can be good business as it potentially enhances a \ncompany\u2019s profits, management effectiveness, public image and employee relations \n(Fleckenstein and Huebsch, 1999; Hudson and Miller, 2005). Yet, although more \nattention is now being paid to ethics in tourism (Kalisch, 2002; Holden, 2003) there is a \nvery weak foundation of research into tourism ethics studies to date (Fennell, 1999). The \nconsequence is that the arguments presented for and against CSR in tourism are often \nsimplistic and largely without any practical evidence.  \n \nEthical Decision Making \n \nThe two approaches to ethical decision-making which have received most attention in the \nliterature are those reliant on the theories of deontology and teleology (McDonald and \nBeck-Dudley, 1994).  A deontological approach enjoys a rich historical legacy, dating \nback to philosophers such as Socrates, and more recently to the work of Kant.  \nDeontology is concerned with the idea of universal truths and principles, which should be \nadhered to regardless of the circumstances.  Kant\u2019s categorical imperative states that a \nperson faced with a problem should be able to respond consistently and in conformity \nwith their moral principles and also feel comfortable with the decision being made in full \nview of others.  A teleological view can be understood as \u201cconsequentialism\u201d (Kaynama \net al., 1996) following from the philosophical work of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart \nMill on utilitarianism.  Thus, ethical decisions are made in view of expected outcomes, \nwhich eliminate the universality of decisions and subordinates principles to context.   \n \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 7 \nA common expression for the two approaches would be that deontology places the means \nas more important than the end, while for teleology it is the end that justifies the means. \nUnderstanding these theories helps to successfully employ the various \u201ctools\u201d that exist \nto control the tourism industry, ranging from market-based instruments such as taxes \nthrough to more command and control instruments such as legislation.  For a \ndeontologist, breaking the law would contravene their view of ethics and so the \nlegislation would be abided by almost regardless of the value of the legislation.  Yet, a \nteleologist would consider the consequences of not abiding by the law and would weigh \nthis against the benefits of breaking the law.  If tourism students seem to adopt a \nteleological approach to ethical dilemmas, then legislation can only expect to be effective \nif accompanied by stringent penalties that make the outlawed behaviour not worthwhile, \nand hence the need to understand how decisions are made.   \n \nMalloy & Fennell (1998), Cleek & Leonard (1998) and Stevens (2001) all point to the \nincreasing prevalence of codes of ethics employed by the tourism industry as a tool to \nprovide guidance to employees when making decisions.  An important contribution in \nthis area has been made by the World Tourism Organization, who in 1999 approved the \nGlobal Code of Ethics for Tourism that consolidated and reinforced previous \nrecommendations and declarations on sustainable tourism.  The Code aims to preserve \nthe world\u2019s natural resources and cultural heritage from disruptive tourist activities and to \nensure a fair and equitable sharing of benefits that arise out of tourism with the residents \nof tourism destinations.  Yet the code is not supported by an understanding of how \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 8 \nindustry practitioners make their decisions. Indeed, the lack of awareness within the \nindustry of the code would indicate the code is not a particularly effective tool. \n \nInfluences on Ethical Decision Making \n \nPrevious theory suggests that there are a number of influences on ethical decision making \nof students, including nationality, the type of ethical dilemma, prior ethical education, \nand gender. Prior research in cross-cultural or cross-national ethical values of students \nhas been quite contradictory. For example, Lysonski and Gaidis (1991) found that \nbusiness students\u2019 ethical orientations were similar in the USA, Denmark and New \nZealand. However, Okleshen and Hoyt (1996) found that US students were less tolerant \nthan New Zealand students of situations involving the ethical constructs of fraud, \ncoercion and self-interest. Whipple and Swords (1992) suggest that the field of business \nethics has not attracted the degree of academic interest in the UK as it has in the US, and \nthat more business ethics courses are needed in Britain to counter the difference in ethical \njudgements found.  \n \nEthical decision making is also likely to be influenced by the type of ethical dilemma \nfaced. Jones (1991) showed ethical issues can be classified according to their intensity, \nwith respondents more likely to respond according to ethical principles if the issue is \ndeemed as important. Applied ethics has evolved for functions and aspects such as \nbusiness ethics, marketing ethics, and accounting ethics, but discussion of sustainable \ntourism ethics and the moral appropriateness of sustainable tourism in various contexts is \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 9 \nsomewhat muted by comparison (Fennell, 1999). In western societies over the last few \ndecades, an increased recognition that the world\u2019s resources are limited, has led to the \nstrengthening of an environmental ethic, whereby the natural environment is recognised \nto have an intrinsic value which outweighs its value as a leisure asset (Holden, 2003). \nYet, despite understanding the concept of the \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d, attention to the \nnegative economic and socio-cultural impacts of tourism is less evident (Jamal, 2004). \nIndeed, a recent review of tourism journals shows a heavy bias in favour of papers that \nfocus on the environmental issues arising from the industry (Hughes, 2005), reflecting the \nacknowledged predisposition NGOs have previously held towards the environment \n(Scheyvens, 2002). Through exposure to these debates students are potentially more \nlikely to be sensitive to environmental issues. \n \nThe level of ethical education is likely to have an influence on ethical decision making \n(Whitney, 1989). The last decade has seen an increase in the demands for ethical training \namongst tourism students (Tribe, 2002; Jamal, 2004). However, there is little evidence \nthat tourism students are receiving ethical education (Cohen, et al. 2001; Whitney, 1989), \nand no research has looked at the relationship between this training and ethical decision \nmaking. Singh\u2019s (1989) survey of Canadian management schools shows that nearly half \nof all those Universities surveyed did not offer a formal course in business ethics to their \nstudents. Enghagen (1991) found a higher proportion of courses were offered in the US \nfor hospitality education, although the majority of ethics courses offered were electives. \nStudies which have attempted to measure the impact of teaching ethics to students have \nshown improved, but short-lived improvements in the ethical values and reasoning skills \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 10 \nof students (Fulmer and Cargile, 1987; Weber, 1990). Harris (1991) found that business \nmajors profess a teleogical (Egoist and Utilitarian) approach, whereas non-business \nmajors prefer a deontological (Golden Rule and Kant\u2019s Imperative) approach. Okleshen \nand Hoyt (1996) concluded from their study that educational experience in an ethics \ncourse produces homogeneity and is beneficial towards obtaining cross cultural \nunderstanding and congruence in ethical values. \n \nFinally, studies of ethics and gender have found females to be less tolerant than males of \nsituations involving ethical dilemmas (Ferrell and Skinner, 1988; Beltrami et al., 1984; \nPeterson, Beltramini and Kozmetsky, 1991; Ruegger and King, 1992; Cohen et al., 2001). \nFor example, Whipple and Wolf (1991) found that female students are more critical than \ntheir male classmates of questionable business practices. Others (Gilligan, 1982; \nFreedman and Bartholomew, 1990) have found student females to have higher moral \nvalues than males. Galbraith and Stephenson (1993) demonstrated that female business \nstudents prefer a Utilitarian decision rule while male business students prefer an Egoist \napproach to evaluating ethical dilemmas.  \n \nObjectives \n \nAs one of the world's truly global industries, working with a diversity of cultures, moral \nand ethical values, future business practitioners face the challenge of global ethics \n(Okleshen and Hoyt, 1996). In order to contribute to the development of understanding of \nglobal ethics, this study is responding to calls for the need to document existing ethical \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 11 \nperspectives of individuals from around the world and to identify the determinants of \nethical orientations (Kirande, Rao and Singhapakdi, 2002). From the body of theory \npresented above, it can be hypothesised that ethical decision making will be influence by \nnationality, type of ethical dilemma, prior ethical education, and gender. This hypothesis \nwas tested by examining the ethical decision making of students in the UK, Australia and \nCanada. \n \nMethod \n \nUsing case studies or ethical scenarios has been advocated as the most useful way of \nexamining ethical issues and teaching ethical concepts (Stevens, 2001; Vallen and \nCasado, 2000; Kaynama et al., 1996; Okleshen and Hoyt, 1996). Therefore, five face to \nface interviews were conducted with human resource directors of the major tour operators \nin the UK in order to develop ethical scenarios that could later be used to test students\u2019 \nethical positioning and decision making processes. These large tour operators provide \ndirection to the industry and their stance on ethical problems can be seen as contributing \nheavily to the context in which decisions made by the rest of the industry are judged. \nDeveloping original scenarios was deemed as important in order to avoid \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 \nsolutions to ethical problems that are widely available. To analyse this qualitative \nresearch, Ritchie and Spencer\u2019s (1994) framework for qualitative data analysis was \nfollowed. Using this five stage process, the researcher firstly familiarises himself with an \noverview of the research, and then identifies a \u2018thematic framework\u2019 in which the \nmaterial can be sifted and sorted. The third stage of the framework applies the framework \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 12 \nand indexes the material using the framework and then charts the data through the use of \nheadings and sub headings. The final stage maps and interprets data, completing a \nprocess designed to enhance the internal validity of research by improving the visibility \nand accessibility of the research.  \n \nSix scenarios were developed based on these interviews (see Appendix A) and reflected \nthe three principal areas of concern within the tourism industry. Hence, in order to test \nthe effect of the scenario on the ethical orientation and awareness, following Fennel and \nMalloy (1999), scenarios 1 and 5 were based on social dilemmas, scenarios 2 and 4 were \nbased on environmental dilemmas, and 3 and 6 were economic in orientation (Jones, \n1991; Shaub and Lawrence, 1996).  \n \nThe Multidimensional Ethics Scale (MES) (Reidenbach and Robin, 1988, 1990; Flory et \nal., 1992; Cohen et al., 2001) was used to measure the ethical orientation and awareness \nof the students evaluating these scenarios. The MES has been developed to be used in \nbusiness contexts and permits insights into the cognitive ethical reasoning process, \noffering the advantages that specific modes of moral reasoning can be identified. The \nmeasures of ethical awareness capture the extent to which respondents feel that a \nparticular action is unethical according to the ethical theories of justice (the equitable \ndistribution of reward and punishment), relativism (there are no universal standards of \nmoral value only cultural norms), and deontology and utilitarianism as explained earlier. \nThese theories have been identified in previous reviews of the moral philosophy literature \nand although the scale has its critics (Hyman, 1996), it was chosen for use in this study \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 13 \nbecause it has been used successfully in many empirical studies, and in particular for its \nuse in the only comparable study conducted to date, examining ethical decision making \namongst tour operators (Fennell and Malloy, 1999). \n \nThe MES scale used in this study (see Appendix A) is a semantic differential scale \nconsisting of 10 items representing the four dimensions of ethical behaviour referred to \nabove: justice (the idea of fairness to all), deontology (the extent to which an action is \nconsistent with an individual\u2019s duties or unwritten obligations), utilitarianism (the extent \nto which an action leads to the greatest good for the greatest number of people), and \nrelativism (the extent to which an action is considered acceptable in a culture). \nRespondents were given the six ethical scenarios, and asked to respond in terms of the ten \nitem scale. The polarity of scales was randomized to minimize response effect bias.  \n \nThe MES scale also contains items that measure ethical intention and overall orientation. \nEthical intention was measured using two items. One was in the first person (I \nwould\/would not undertake the same action), and the other, to mitigate social desirability \nbias (Cohen et al., 1998), in the third person (my peers would\/would not undertake the \nsame action). One final item on the scale measured the overall level of ethical orientation \n(the action is ethical\/unethical) capturing the weight respondents placed on each of the \ncriteria in their evaluation of the overall morality of an action. In addition to the MES \nscale, students were asked to indicate their gender, and whether or not they had ever \ntaken a module in ethics. \n \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 14 \nThe questionnaires were distributed to tourism students in Canada, Australia and the UK \nin undergraduate tourism programs at three different institutions. Samples were drawn \nfrom the student population since they were the focus of this study, and they also meet \nthe requirements of matched samples. The matched samples technique is a method \nadvocated by cross-cultural research methodologists where the samples of cultural groups \nto be compared are made as similar as possible in their demographic characteristics \n(Vijver and Leung, 1997). The distribution was achieved via a contact faculty person at \neach university who distributed them in class. The three samples consisted of all tourism \nstudent undergraduates at each institution, giving a sample population of 443. Students \nwere given the option of not participating, and the same instructions were given to each \ngroup as to how the instrument was to be completed. Although all students agreed to \nparticipate, there were five unusable surveys, resulting in a total of 438 usable responses. \nSmith and Oakley (1997) argue that social desirability response bias can be high in \nresearch topics such as ethics, while Kracher, Chatterjee and Lundquist (2002) believe \nany research with students in a university setting must confront the risk of respondents \nseeking the \u2018right\u2019 answer. By stressing the voluntary nature of the survey and conducting \nthe survey at the end of a class the limitations of using University students in research \nhave been recognized. However, the risk of a biased answer needs to be weighed against \nthe value of receiving answers with all its implications for education and understanding \nthe future decision-making of professionals in the industry.  \n \n \n \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 15 \nResults \n \nOf the 438 responses, 187 were from the UK, 135 from Australia and 116 from Canada \n(see Table 1). The gender split was 72% females and 28% male, typical for students of \ntourism. Of the total sample, 23% had received some form of ethical training in the past \n(defined as having taken a module in ethics), higher than found in previous studies of \nstudents (Okleshen and Hoyt, 1996). Canadian students were more likely to have taken \nan ethics course (41%) than Australians (24%) or students form the UK (12%). A test of \nthe reliability of the questions in each ethical scenario confirmed the dimension structure \nreferred to above. Cronbach alpha scores for each of the four dimensions across the six \nscenarios met or exceeded the score of 0.70 recommended by Nunnally (1967) and \nRobinson et al. (1991). \n \n**Table 1 to be inserted here** \n \nWith \u20181\u2019 representing the positive form of the scale item (e.g. fair) and \u20187\u2019 the negative \nform of the item (e.g. unfair), mean scores were calculated for each dilemma by ethical \ndimension and country (see Table 2). The mean scores show that for Justice, Relativism \nand Utilitarianism all students deemed the actions taken in the environmental scenarios to \nbe more unethical than for the economic or social scenarios. However, the construct \nDeontology follows a different pattern with the social scenarios being scored most \nnegatively. These results suggest that ethical decision making approach will be \ninfluenced by the type of ethical dilemma faced, and is evidence of a stronger, more \nprincipled environmental ethic amongst the students (Holden, 2003). \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 16 \n \n**Table 2 to be inserted here** \n \nA two way repeated measure ANOVA (3 x 3) was employed with country of study of \nrespondent (3 groups) as a between subject factor and scenarios (3) as a within subject \nfactor, on the 10 item scale. The results of this test (see Table 3) confirmed that there was \na significant country by scenario interaction for Justice [(F4, 866) = 3.911, p=.004], \nDeontology [(F4, 866) = 4.525, p=.001] and for Utilitarianism [(F4, 866) = 3.463, \np=.008], which indicates that scenario effects vary with the country or visa versa. These \nresults are an initial indication that ethical decision making approaches will vary across \ncountries. However, there was no significant country by scenario interaction for \nRelativism [(F4, 866) = 1.715, p=.144]. \n \n**Table 3 to be inserted here** \n \nFor these significant interactions, further investigation involved the testing of simple \neffects (see Tables 4 and 5). Results indicated that for the Deontology and Utilitarianism \ndimensions there was a significant scenario effect for Canada, Australia and UK, and for \nboth dimensions there was a significant country effect for the Economic scenarios ([(F2, \n434) = 6.97, p=.001; [(F2, 433) = 9.74, p<.001]).  Post hoc analysis (SNK) showed that \nUK students are significantly more likely to perceive that the ethical decision taken \nviolated an unspoken promise or an unwritten contract, and significantly more likely to \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 17 \nperceive that the decision taken produced the greatest benefit to all. This suggests they \nare more teleological in their decision making than students from Canada and Australia. \n \n**Tables 4 and 5 to be inserted here** \n \nA two way repeated measure ANOVA (2 x 3) was also employed with gender of \nrespondent (2 groups) as a between subject factor and scenarios (3) as a within subject \nfactor, on the 10 item scale. The results of this test showed no significant gender by \nscenario interaction for Justice, Deontology, Utilitarianism or Relativism. A similar test \nusing ethical training as a between subject factor again showed no significant ethical \ntraining by scenario interaction for the four dimensions. \n \nThe last two items of the MES scale measure ethical intention and overall orientation. \nAdjusted mean scores were calculated for these measures, and the results are presented in \nTable 6.  Once again there was a significant difference in the responses between \ncountries, controlling for gender and ethical training, especially for the Economic and \nSocial scenarios. For the Economic scenarios, there was a significant difference in ethical \nintention. Students from the UK indicated that they and their peers were more likely (than \nthe other two student groups) to undertake the same action. For the Social scenarios, \nCanadian students were significantly more likely to indicate that their peers would take \nthe same action and significantly more likely to say that the action taken was ethical. \nAustralian students were least satisfied ethically with the action taken. For the \nEnvironmental scenarios, there was a significant difference in ethical intention between \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 18 \ngenders. Subsequent analysis revealed that females and their peers were significantly less \nlikely (than males) to undertake the same action. Although previous analysis showed no \nsignificant gender by scenario interaction for the four ethical dimensions, this does \nconfirm to some extent that female students are more sensitive to ethical issues than their \nmale counterparts. Whether or not respondents had, previously taken a module in ethics \nhad no effect on ethical intention or overall ethical orientation. Ethical decision making \n(in this study) is therefore not influenced by the level of prior ethical education. \n  \n \n**Table 6 to be inserted here** \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe results show that significant differences in ethical decision making were limited to \nthe Deontology and Utilitarianism  subscales in the Economic scenarios only. For the \nEconomic scenarios, UK students were more likely to perceive that the ethical decision \nmade violated an unspoken promise, and more likely to consider if the decision produced \nthe greatest benefit to all, and hence were more teleological in their ethical decision \nmaking. For the economic scenarios, UK students were also more likely to indicate that \nthe decision made was an ethical one.  \n \nIt has been suggested that a teleological approach might have more application in the \ntourism industry because managers can be taught to compare outcomes to the various \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 19 \nstakeholders for each possible decision and select the decision that has the best outcomes \nKhan and McCleary, 1996; Carroll,1989). Previous research supports such a teleological \napproach for analyzing ethical dilemmas (Jazray, 2002; Blanchard and Peale, 1988; Hall, \n1992) and there is potential in the tourism industry for a teleological approach to ethics to \nbe used as a means by which to educate and learn through an understanding of the \nconsequences of one\u2019s actions (Malloy and Fennell, 1998). The danger with this approach \nis that once an (often) economic benefit disappears to protect or preserve, then so does \nthe basis on which the preservation is justified. A deontological underpinning, although \nless fashionable provides more protection against the vicissitudes of the market. \nHowever, a teleological approach would sit comfortably with ethical instruction being \ninterwoven with other subjects of study and avoid ethics being taught as a separate \nsubject, which could prevent students from thinking in a holistic manner.  \n \nThe results also show that there was no significant country by scenario interaction for \nRelativism. This supports the work by Cohen et al. (2001) who found that relativism had \nlittle effect on ethical decision making. This has potentially an interesting consequence \nfor the use of examples as a way to instruct students, but also to illustrate future \ndirections for industry. If students show that they are guided by what is fair or unfair, \nright or wrong, has utility or not, but are not particularly guided by the position of others, \nthen demonstrating what others have done in a similar scenario is not appealing to a form \nof decision making that students employ. As such, case studies may be useful to \ndemonstrate the range of actions possible, or to encourage students to consider what \nalternatives are available, but this survey would suggest that students are not likely to be \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 20 \nguided by examples of what others have done. This finding may be contained to this \nparticular study and it might be that with a sample of people working in the industry then \na more relativistic approach is valuable. However, further research could seek to ascertain \nthe usefulness of best practice type examples in providing ethical instruction to students.  \n \nThe fact that prior ethical education had no effect on the students\u2019 responses in any of the \nanalysis, contradicts previous findings (Okleshen and Hoyt, 1996). Although 41% of \nCanadian students had taken an ethics module (compared to 24% in Australia and 12% in \nthe UK), it does not appear that they are any more sensitive to ethical issues. It may be a \nconcern to British tourism educators that only 12% of students had taken an ethics \ncourse. Previous studies have found UK firms to be lagging behind their US counterparts \nin response to ethical concerns (Schlegelmilch, 1989), and there have been calls for more \nbusiness ethics courses at British Universities (Whipple and Swords, 1992). However, it \nshould be acknowledged that even though the majority of students in this study indicated \nthat they had not taken an ethics module during the course of their studies, it does not \nmean they have not received any ethical training. Indeed, the ethical training students \nhave received may have been embedded within the study of other subjects and so not \ndiscerned as separate ethical training. This demonstrates the difficulty of identifying the \neffect of ethical training and certainly needs further investigation.  \n \nSimilar to many prior studies referred to earlier in the paper, the results indicated that \nfemale students are more sensitive to ethical issues than males in terms of their ethical \nintention \u2013 particularly for environmental issues. These findings suggest that as more and \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 21 \nmore women complete their education and enter the business world, ethical decision \nmaking in organizations may change (Whipple and Swords, 1992). Also, educators who \nare developing and teaching business ethics and social responsibility course should pay \nattention to gender differentiated development needs.  Respondents as a whole (and not \njust female students) were least satisfied with the decision taken with the environmental \nscenarios. This supports the contention made previously, that students are more exposed \nto ethical scenarios related to the environment (Hughes, 2005). There is a need therefore, \nfor the tourism curriculum to integrate more social and economic ethical dilemmas. \n \nIn terms of informing decisions on the use of tools to direct the tourism industry, the \ndismissal of Relativism would suggest that tools that rely on pressure to conform to what \nother members of the industry are doing would be ineffective. Malloy and Fennell \n(1998), Cleek and Leonard (1998) and Stevens (2001) all point to the increasing \nprevalence of codes of ethics employed by organisations as a way of promoting more \nethically consistent decisions by their employees. While Malloy and Fennell (1998) \ndeclare the majority of codes to be deontological in their language, no previous study has \nsought to assess ethically how decisions are made by those that are subject to the codes. \nHence, voluntary efforts such as \u2018compacts\u2019 or attempts to \u2018name and shame\u2019 may not be \nuseful. The evident use made of Deontology, Justice and Utilitarianism demonstrates that \ncodes of ethics may be valuable, but more research is needed to interrogate these \nrelationships further. Further research showing whether tourism managers applied a more \nteleological approach to decisions would reveal deontological codes of ethics to be little \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 22 \nmore than an exercise in promoting external goodwill, while the opposite finding \nstrengthens the case for codes of ethics (Rondinelli and Berry, 2000).  \n \nAlthough there were significant differences across the three institutions, there were many \ncommonalities in ethical decision making in this study. This may reflect the similar \ncultures and the common educational systems of the three countries chosen, but it bodes \nwell for the application of a consistent approach to tourism management throughout the \nworld, as well as the introduction of common tools and educational approaches. A natural \nsequitur of research into the level of ethics displayed by students is the ethical \norientations of those in organisations. Stevens (2001) believes ethics for the hospitality \nindustry to be crucial because of the situations in which employees are regularly placed. \nThis coupled with the high turnover rate of employees makes the industry susceptible to \ndishonesty and the acquisition of a poor reputation. Rondinelli and Berry (2000) \ndemonstrate the focus many large enterprises pay to internal issues in a bid to promote \nmore sustainable practices (whether for intrinsic or extrinsic reasons), but often fail to \ndraw sufficient attention through external practices (such as community projects, \nsponsored clean-ups etc) to the behaviour of the organisation. By contrast, Wight (1994) \nillustrates the existence of companies who engage in more external practices in a bid to \nconceal a lack of internal actions and so engage in \u201cgreenwash\u201d. In addition to the harm \ndone to the reputation of the industry, such practices serve to create an illusion of what \nworking for a particular organisation, or in a particular industry would be like. Research \ninto the ethical approaches and positions of tourism managers and employees would \nassists in ensuring more appropriate, or at least better prepared, students join tourism \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 23 \norganisations. As such, the ethical scenarios developed through interviews with senior \nmembers of the industry makes a strong contribution to future research and as an aid to \nteaching in this area. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe tourism literature makes a continual call for more decisions to be made that \nacknowledge the full impacts of the industry and yet little research has been conducted \nthat attempts to establish the ethical framework the managers of the future will employ to \napproach these decisions. This research has drawn on the work of other subject \ndisciplines and applied an established research methodology to tourism students in three \ndifferent countries. Such research has enabled more informed discussions about what is \nrequired from ethical instruction in the future. It should be noted that the intention of this \nresearch was not to determine what is ethical or unethical. Rather, it was to assess how \nthe characteristics of issues influence ethical beliefs, how individuals think and devise \nwhat is ethical and unethical and how different variables influence ethical perceptions \n(Trevino, 1986). Once greater knowledge exists about how students and businesses are \nmaking decisions, then discussions of which tools are appropriate to enable or constrain \nthose decisions become more apposite. \n \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 24 \nAppendix A: MES and Ethical Scenarios \n \nScenario Number 1 \nA major tour operator doesn\u2019t charge disabled customers extra money to travel despite the fact that the tour \noperator itself is being charged more by the airline and the hotels for the difficulty of transporting \nwheelchairs and the extra care and time necessary with disabled customers. This policy results in the tour \noperator being increasingly popular with disabled customers, but this is costing the tour operator money.  \nAction:  \nThe tour operator decides to offer the same policy as all the other major tour operators and pass on the \ncharges levied by the airlines and hotels, and so reduce the number of its disabled customers.  \nYour response to the action is that it is\u2026 \n \n \nScenario Number 2 \nA major international tourism developer has plans to build a significant development in an undeveloped \narea of a lesser developed country. The resort will bring much needed employment, investment and, it is \nargued, a reason for the young of the town not to migrate to the big cities. The centrepiece of the new resort \nis planned to be a 72-hole golf course. The local residents are worried that to provide enough water for the \ngolf course and electricity for the resort will mean local supplies are negatively affected. Fishermen are \nworried that the run off from the pesticides used on the golf course will have severe effects on the health of \ntheir fish stocks.  \nAction:  \nThe development goes ahead as planned and does negatively affect the local electricity and water supplies \nwhile harming fish stocks.  \n \nScenario Number 3 \nThe downturn in the tourism industry as a result of the increase in global terrorism has meant a large tour \noperator has to make redundancies for the first time in its history. There are several members of staff with \nvery high records of absenteeism due to personal illness and thus very low levels of productivity. Some of \nthese members of staff have been with the tour operator for a very long time, and two have been with the \ncompany since it first began in business over 25 years ago. Prior to the recent terrorism the company was \nexpanding and had just recruited 20 university graduates who are currently spending 6 months shadowing \nmanagers in the different areas of the business before they settle into their permanent positions. The \ncompany realises that to make the new recruits redundant will be much cheaper than to make the long time   \nemployees redundant even though the company expects the new graduates will be more productive in the \nlong term.  \nAction:   \nThe Company makes 20 new graduates redundant and blames the economic downturn caused by terrorism.  \n \nScenario Number 4 \nA large resort produces high amounts of sewage, which is piped into the sea surrounding the resort. There \nare no laws to prevent the resort from disposing of its sewage in this manner, but it is believed that this \nFair        Unfair \nJust        Unjust \nMorally right        Not morally right \nAcceptable to my family        Not acceptable to my family \nTraditionally acceptable        Not traditionally acceptable \nCulturally acceptable        Not culturally acceptable \nProduces the greatest benefit to all        Produces the least benefit to all \nMaximises benefits while minimises harm        Minimises benefits while maximises harm \nDoes not violate an unspoken promise        Violates an unspoken promise \nDoes not violate an unwritten contract        Violates an unwritten contract \nI would undertake the same action        I would not undertake the same action \nMy peers would undertake the same action        My peers would not undertake the same action \nThe action is ethical        The action is unethical \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 25 \nsewage is responsible for the deterioration in the quality of the coral, which has led to complaints from \nlocal SCUBA diving operators. The resort does not operate any diving itself as its guests are largely retired \ncouples who prefer to use the resort\u2019s many swimming pools. The resort argues that to dispose of its \nsewage in a way that protected the coral would involve considerable cost.  \nAction:  \nThe resort continues to dispose of its sewage directly into the sea and this continues to affect the coral.  \n \nScenario Number 5 \nA small, remote community feels very strongly about preserving the Sabbath and has refused to allow \nflights on Sundays to land or depart from its airport. However, the natural beauty of the island and its \nabundance of bird life has made it increasingly popular with tourists and provided the local economy with a \nmuch needed source of income. In order to take advantage of a strong demand from those wanting to take \nweekend breaks there is a proposal from the only airline serving the island to begin flights on Sundays \nduring the main tourist season.  \nAction:   \nThe airline begins a limited number of Sunday flights.  \n \nScenario Number 6 \nTwo tour reps in a destination are responsible for selling excursions to the package tourists once they \narrive. The excursions represent an important part of the income for the tour operator who relies on high-\npressure sales tactics by the reps to sell the excursions. The two tour reps feel that although they work hard \nand work for very long hours they are not paid enough to live properly. The reps decide that as most \ncustomers pay cash, they could keep the money paid by some people going on the excursion, let those \npeople onto the coach as normal but not tell the company.  \nAction:  \nThe tour reps decide to keep the cash from two customers per excursion and benefit \u00a325 each per week \nfrom doing so. \n \n \nEthical Orientation and Awareness of Tourism Students \n \n 26 \nReferences  \n \nArcher, B., C.
