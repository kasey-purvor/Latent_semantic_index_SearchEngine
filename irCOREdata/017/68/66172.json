Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \nINTRODUCTION \nROCK CLIFFS FORM some of the most impressive and widespread coastal \nlandforms, accounting for approximately 75% of the total length of coastlines \nworldwide (Bird, 2000).  Although cliffs form a critical interface between the \nterrestrial and marine environments, our understanding of the processes through \nwhich they evolve is limited.  Cliff retreat is a significant threat to coastal \ncommunities around the world (Jones and Lee, 1994; Lee, 2001), especially in the \ncontext of increasing coastal populations (Haslett, 2000) and potentially \naccelerated process rates resulting from climate change (Houghton et al., 2001).  It \nis estimated for example that annual UK government spending on coastal and \nflood defences is set to reach \u00a3564 million in 2005 (DEFRA, 2001).  Failure to \nunderstand the processes through which rock cliffs evolve means that many \ncoastal protection schemes are poorly designed or inappropriate (Hall et al. 2002).   \nCoastal cliffs are complex landforms, comprising a steep, eroding rock slope \nthat responds to a wide range of environmental variables.  The strength of a cliff is \nderived from the properties of the materials from which it is formed.  In most \ncases, these materials are broken into unevenly-sized segments by planes of \nweakness such as joints, faults or bedding surfaces.  Retreat of the cliff occurs \nthrough incremental erosion and\/or through detachment of parts of the cliff \nthrough falling, sliding or toppling (Hantz et al., 2003).  The mechanisms are \ndriven by environmental factors such as weathering rates, groundwater levels, \nwave impact and human activity, all of which vary over time and through space \n(Robinson, 1974).  In most cases it is the interaction between these processes and \nthe resisting properties of the cliff itself that determine the rate of retreat. \n \nAccurate descriptions of morphometric changes occurring over a range of \nspatial and temporal scales are required to enable an understanding of landform \nevolution.  One established technique for collecting this data is through the use of \nphotogrammetry, but this approach is hindered by the nature of the coastal \nenvironment.  Near-vertical, unstable slopes are difficult environments for the \nmanual collection of ground control points across image overlaps, and light \ncontrasts, shadowing and perspective variations limit the success of automated \nstereomatching processes.  However, the development of sophisticated, versatile \nterrestrial laser scanners offers a new method of field survey in geomorphology \n(Nagihara et al., 2004).  Laser scanning systems collect elevation information \ndirectly, removing many of the uncertainties associated with data processing and \ndigital elevation model (DEM) generation.  Emitting radiation at wavelengths \nbeyond those of visible light, laser scanners are essentially unaffected by changes \nin the ambient conditions during data collection.  However, laser scanning \ntechniques alone do not currently provide adequate qualitative information on the \nenvironmental conditions at the site, such as the cliff lithology.  To circumvent \nthese problems, in this paper we examine the integration of terrestrial time-of-\nflight laser scanning with high-resolution digital photogrammetry to generate \naccurate information on the geomorphic processes governing cliff development.  \nThe aim is to promote a new approach to cliff monitoring, supplementing the data \n2 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \nfrom aerial techniques with a better understanding of the processes in operation \nover the cliff face itself.  The combination of photographic images resampled \nwithin the fixed accuracies of laser scanning has provided a promising source of \nqualitative and quantitative information.   \nMONITORING CLIFF CHANGE \nConventional techniques for quantifying cliff change include erosion pins \nlocated within the rock mass base (Lee et al., 1976) and aerial surveys (Hua and \nFairbairn, 2000).   Erosion pins have proven useful in quantifying small scale \nchanges caused by weathering effects, but remain limited spatially and temporally \nby the position and life of the nail networks.  Aerial surveys, sometimes \nsupplemented by the analysis of historic map data, by definition record cliff top \nand toe recession which is ultimately only the result of a more complex process of \ncliff surface erosion, but the errors involved can be considerable (Moore, 2000).  \nSome improvement can be achieved with the use of a good quality ground control \nsystem, although the location of recognisable markers visible from an aerial \nperspective is often problematic, particularly in coastal locations.  In the case of \nhistoric maps, problems occur because of errors associated with shrinkage and \nstretching of the physical document over time, in addition to general issues of \naccuracy and precision associated with map production (Snyder, 1987).  The \ncumulative errors within the source documents and images are often several orders \nof magnitude larger than the rate of retreat being measured.  As a result, \nmeasurements typically lack comparability both between separate surveys and \nwithin each mapping project (Crowell et al., 1991).  In the case of aerial surveys, \ntwo key disadvantages are clear.  First, the high costs associated with data capture \nlimit the frequency at which change can be monitored; even annual data on cliff \ntop and toe positions are rare.  Second, vertical aerial photography is poorly suited \nto the measurement of processes associated with near-vertical surfaces.  \nNonetheless, aerial surveys have remained the principal method of recording \nshoreline change (Boggett et al., 2000).   \n \n An alternative approach to the measurement of cliff retreat rates is through \nthe direct measurement of processes operating on the cliff face itself.  Manual \nmeasurements are often impractical due to the difficult terrain and the danger \nposed by rockfalls and tides.  Thus, remotely sensed rapid data acquisition \ntechniques have much to offer studies of cliff slope processes and evolution \n(Wickens and Barton, 1971; Chandler and Moore, 1989), but until now have been \ninsufficiently developed to allow the required level of precision to be achieved.   \n \nTERRESTRIAL DIGITAL PHOTOGRAMMETRY \nThe availability of increasingly sophisticated, cost-effective and automated \ndigital systems has facilitated the use of photogrammetric techniques in a wide \nrange of geomorphic studies (Baltsavias et al., 2001).  The ability to monitor the \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 3 \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \ntemporal evolution of three-dimensional forms at high resolutions has led to \nsuccessful applications that have improved our understanding of a variety of \nfluvial (Latulippe et al., 2001; Brasington et al., 2003) and terrestrial \nenvironments (Genovois et al., 2001).  A detailed account of the effective use of \nestablished digital techniques for geomorphological investigations is provided by \nChandler (1999).  Digital photogrammetry has been shown to outperform \nanalytical approaches for the recording of topographic features, both in terms of \ndata collection times and overall accuracy (Bailey et al., 2003).  However, this \ntechnology can also widen the gap between the operator and an appropriate level \nof understanding of the system outputs (Krupnik, 2003).  Whilst it is essential that \nthe uncertainties associated with the process of deriving the data must be \nunderstood, it is clear that the relative ease of DEM generation has led to an \nemphasis in many projects on data analysis without adequate consideration of data \nquality (Huang, 2000).  Indeed, the techniques that are used to assess the quality \nof DEMs are often inadequate to assess their reported accuracies.   \n \nThe accuracy of photogrammetric grid DEMs can be characterised by the \nroot mean square error (rmse) of every interpolated point in the model.  In practice \nsuch a complete evaluation of the surface is impractical.  The function is therefore \ncommonly performed on check point data, thereby providing a quantitative \nestimate of bilinear interpolations using localised errors associated with data \nindependent from the DEM construction process.  Several questions have been \nraised as to the validity of deriving a finite set of rmse values for an entire model.  \nThe variable accuracy and location of check points are key determinants in the \nimpression of the DEM performance gained from rmse observations (Gooch and \nChandler 2001).  The distribution and quantity of residuals from discarded ground \ncontrol points (GCPs) have been used to identify error trends across blocks, \ndemonstrating statistically significant errors which are not conveyed in rmse \ncalculations (Brasington et al., 2003).  Significant variability has also been noted \nwithin other error statistics such as mean error and standard deviation error for the \nsame set of processes (Lane et al., 2000).  Statistical improvements in processing \nevaluations therefore do not necessarily equate to more accurately represented \nDEMs (Butler et al., 1998).   \n \nMany softcopy digital photogrammetric suites produce spatial classifications \nof the matching performance associated with each DEM extracted.  Interpolation \nof elevations may result if the parameters defining the matching algorithms are not \nmet.  The threshold for interpolation may prove a critical factor in the ultimate \nperformance of the model (Lane et al., 2003).  Higher correlation minimums \nequate to greater confidence in the matching success of the model, but are also \nlikely to generate increased interpolation as fewer points meet the acceptance \ncriteria (Bailey et al., 2003).  The limitations of software-supported DEM \nassessments have led to the development of new, independent methods for \nchecking data fidelity.  DEM quality is heavily reliant on the adequacy of the \nalgorithms used to reconstruct the terrain.  The increasing range of choices and \nvaried combinations of factors that influence DEM production raise questions over \nthe most appropriate strategies for obtaining required accuracies.  An idealised set \n4 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \nof search parameters would generate an accurate DEM in which only successfully \ncorrelated points were used.  In reality DEMs may often include unsuccessfully \ncorrelated areas and consequently distort or even reject some correctly matched \npoints.  Gooch and Chandler (2001) developed a strategy-based error detection \nscheme in order to analyse the spatial distribution of suspect correlations within a \nDEM.  The technique involves subtracting two identical DEMs, varying only in \nthe parameter settings used, to generate a difference DEM.  The greatest change \non the difference DEM will be principally determined by the heightened response \nof erroneous or \u201cfailed\u201d areas which are commonly mismatched under different \nparameters.  This failure warning model has proved to be a robust answer to the \nidentification of poor performance within DEMs from a range of image scales.   \n \nIn the case of dynamic natural features such as cliff faces, problems with \ngenerating surface models may occur because image quality is influenced by a \nvariety of factors.  Huang (2000) demonstrated that the changes in surface \nroughness across small sections of cliff face can cause differing levels of \ninformation loss in photogrammetrically-derived DEMs.  In order to accurately \nidentify and quantify the errors within a photogrammetric model, a more \nrepresentative surface of comparable resolution is required (Chandler et al., 2003).   \nTERRESTRIAL LASER SCANNING \nThe development of laser scanning technologies offers a new method of remote \nsensing for geomorphological applications.  A wide variety of scanning systems \nare available, which fall within two broad concepts of data collection: \ntriangulation and time-of-flight.  Triangulating laser scanners emit a concentrated \nbeam of light across a surface which is captured by a fixed digital sensor, enabling \nprecise triangulations to be made of recorded surfaces.  Triangulating systems are \nlimited in terms of geomorphological applications by the size and weight of the \ndevices, their fragility, the excessive data-sets generated and most significantly \ntheir scanning range; typically less than 10 m.  Assuming the speed of an emitted \nlaser pulse to be constant, time-of-flight technology uses the delay in return signal \nto calculate the distance to the target.  The laser emitter is manipulated using \nmotorised mirrors, enabling it to scan back and forth over surfaces to form a \ndetailed impression of elevation.  The time-of-flight approach allows for the \nincrements between passes and within pulse emissions to determine the \nconcentration of data collected.  Designed to record surfaces under a wide range of \nconditions (Nagihara et al., 2004), time-of-flight devices are generally well suited \nto data collection in the natural environment. \n \nTerrestrial laser scanners involve certain limitations which must be \nconsidered (Kersten et al., 2004).  The absence of a calibrated target introduces \nnumerous variables into the distance reading obtained.  The characteristics of the \nreflecting surface, its roughness, wetness, distance from the scanner, material \ncomponents and its incident angle all influence the strength of the return signal \n(Lichti and Harvey, 2002).  Although beyond those of visible light, the band \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 5 \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \nwidths used (750 \u2013 1500 nm) function on the periphery of atmospheric \nwavelengths, allowing certain portions of the radiation to be absorbed into the \natmosphere.  This causes wet surfaces to have a lower reflectance, degrading the \nsignal strength of the reflected beam.  The registration of the returning laser pulse \nassumes the strongest part of the returning beam originates from the centre of the \nfootprint on the target.  This concentric weighting is distorted when the span of the \nfootprint overlaps areas of contrasting reflectance.  When analysing the elevation \ndata, the lack of RGB data also limits the qualitative assessment of data recorded, \nrestricting interpretation of difference models.  Despite these issues, the point \ncloud data produced over the ranges associated with typical monitoring of cliff \nfaces are capable of producing accuracies within \u00b10.06 m.  It is noted however \nthat when recording complex features, point accuracies do not necessarily equate \nto comparable surface accuracies.  Meshed (triangulated) point clouds are \ndegraded by occlusions which cause holes in the data surface and errors associated \nwith the precise location and orientation of the scanning system.  It is clear \ntherefore that the techniques for terrestrial laser scanning can benefit substantially \nfrom the application of rigorous approaches to data collection developed for \nexample in photogrammetry. \nSTUDY AREA \nThe study area is centred upon a set of 60 m high coastal cliffs to the east of \nthe village of Staithes, in North Yorkshire, NE England (National Grid \ncoordinates NZ760192 \u2013 NZ784189) (Fig. 1).  The cliffs are formed from middle \nLias lithologies, capped by up to 10 m of glacial till.  The Lias rocks consist of \ninterbedded mudstones, shales and sandstones with occasional thin seams of \nironstone.  The indurated mudstone base of the cliff appears to provide the most \nresistance to erosion, often causing the toe to protrude from the rock mass.  A \nrange of rock strengths, bedding patterns, jointing and faulting mean that cliff \nprofiles are variable in form, containing a mixture of smooth and angular surfaces.  \nFactors promoting failure include wave erosion of the cliff toe (Rawson and \nWright, 2000) and weathering of the shales in the middle cliff sections (Agar, \n1960).  The environmental processes that drive these two mechanisms lead to \nsmall scale failures across the exposed face.  Interestingly, although often \nconsidered insignificant in determining the overall cliff form, the cumulative \neffects of multiple small failures on steep rock cliffs remain unquantified (Lee et \nal., 2002). \n \n6 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \n \n.Previously estimated rates of recession for this stretch of cliffs are 0.05m per \nannum at the toe and 0.02 m per annum at the top, based on differences between \nOrdnance Survey maps dated 1892 and 1960 (Agar, 1960).  The figures seem to \nsuggest that the overall cliff morphology is changing through time, tending \ntowards a steepening cliff profile.  There appears to be little geomorphological \nevidence to support this, suggesting that there are substantial errors in retreat data.  \nDespite its simplistic approach to cliff change, the retreat rates indicate sensitivity \nto the variety of geological settings along the coastline (Table I).  In addition, \nthese data suggest that there is also a morphological control on coastal retreat \n(Table II), with erosion in bays outstripping headland retreat.  This would act to \naccentuate the large-scale coastal morphology over time.  It is clear that there is \nconsiderable complexity of processes governing the recession of the cliffs at \nStaithes, raising further questions over the adequacy of aerial monitoring \ntechniques for such an application.  Therefore, despite extensive and detailed \nstudies on the cliffs of North Yorkshire, the specific mechanisms by which these \ncoastal forms evolve remain poorly understood.  \n \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 7 \nLIM. et al.

The targets were surveyed \nto millimetre accuracy in three dimensions and used analyse the interior \norientation parameters of focal length, principal point offset, radial lens distortion \n(k1, k2, k3) and tangential distortion.

Studs were installed into the shore platform in order to allow the \nrepeated capture of images from the same location.  The minimum required \nresolution was set to \u00b10.02 m and used as the main determinant in positioning the \nbase stations.  This pixel spacing produces a DEM of 0.1 m resolution in ERDAS \nOrthoBASE, given the 5 \u00d7 5 pixel search area required for each elevation.  Given \nthe 28 mm focal length of the lens and the 4536 \u00d7 3024 size of the imaging array, \nthe maximum required distance between the cliff face and the camera is about 70 \nm.  The number of images captured at each site ranged from three (Site B) to six \n(Site D).  The distance was reduced when the cliff height permitted.  Base to \nheight ratios of 0.6 or lower were used wherever possible.  A pilot study indicated \nthat a large overlap was necessary to reduce occlusion and maximise image \ncorrelation.  \n \nA Leica TPS1200 reflectorless total station was used to collect the \nprecise coordinates of distinguishable natural features on the cliff, forming the \nbasis of a control point network.  The restriction of control points to areas of \ndifference such as recognisable joints or the corners of overhangs may reduce the \noverall accuracy of the photogrammetric models (Fox and Gooch, 2001).  \nOptimisation of ground control quality therefore required cliff features to be \ncarefully selected, where a precise point target could be identified and considered \ngenerally representative of the wider rock face in that area.  In order to assess the \naccuracy of the ground control under conditions experienced at the coast a test \nstudy was conducted.  A grid of 25 control points was identified across Site A, the \nhighest cliff section in the study area, and resurveyed ten times.  The grid \nconsisted of five rows of five points dissecting the cliff face horizontally at \napproximately 10 m height intervals forming five vertical columns.  The total \nstation was removed and reset in between each of the ten collections of the grid, \nestablishing a measure of the repeatability and accuracy of the points.  The \nstandard deviation of measurements across the network showed error ranges \nconsistently within 0.03 m (Table III).  No significant relationships were identified \nwith radial distance from the survey station, nor by GCP row either with \nincreasing height up the cliff or GCP position across the cliff face.  The \nreflectorless total station therefore provides highly accurate ground control \nrelative to both the precision of the laser scan survey and the magnitude of \nchanges under examination on the cliff face.  The terrestrially orientated control \npoint coordinates were processed through a transformation matrix to obtain Z as \nthe photo direction.  The block was then translated to create a zero base-level \nbehind the cliff face.  The conversion is necessary because of the nature of the \nalgorithms used for DEM extraction in most softcopy photogrammetric suites, \nwhich have been developed for aerial applications.   \n \n \n \nTABLE III: Accuracy of control points obtained with the reflectorless total station, expressed as the \naverage standard deviation in x, y and z axis for each point aggregated across the survey network. \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 9 \nLIM. et al.

The resolution of each point is the size of the width of the laser lens, \n0.046 m, plus the 0.003 m\/m divergence of the beam.  Prior to collection the \nLaserAce was calibrated to a range precision of 0.025 m at 200 m and the \nhorizontal and vertical angles checked to within 0.01\u00ba.  The scanner was \npositioned over the most central of the capture stations, levelled and orientated \ntowards a triangulation point previously located with a differential Leica \nGPS1200.  The azimuth orientation of the scanner was set to collect data in the \nsame coordinate system as the photogrammetry.  A required resolution of 0.05 m \nwas specified to generate comparable spatial data coverage to the \nphotogrammetric output.  The LaserAce 600 instrument is designed to be water \nand dust resistant to IP66 specifications, making it a robust answer to the \nchallenges of monitoring in coastal environments. \nIMAGE PROCESSING \nThe raw image data was processed in OrthoBASE Professional.  The most \nimportant aspect of the digital rectification process involves automatic aerial \ntriangulation of the image block.  The procedure links images through the exterior \norientation and control point parameters determined at the point of capture.  A \nsimilarity transformation is then applied to this information, connecting each \nimage to all those around it.  Once the images have been geometrically related, \nfeature extraction and image matching are undertaken in order to collect around \n500 distinct tie points within overlapping areas.  OrthoBASE uses feature-based \nmatching with additional area correlation and geometrical and topological \nconstraints in order to define point collection (Wang et al., 2002).  A hierarchical \nsystem of searching is employed and least squares matching performed on the last \niteration in order to calculate errors (Chandler et al., 2003).  Tie point numbers, \nconcentrations and matching strength can be user-defined to suit the specific \ncharacteristics of the overlapped area (ERDAS, 2001).  Increased numbers of tie \npoints are thought to be important in ensuring block stability (Wang, 1996).  \nWhen less than 300 tie points were automatically detected during processing, the \ndefault correlation of 0.8 was lowered to 0.7, reducing the inclusion thresholds for \naccepted ties.  Reducing the correlation below this to the minimum of 0.6 \n10 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nLIM. et al.

The collection performed significantly better on the \nred and blue portions of the images, which were more closely linked with changes \nin contrast.  Bundle adjustment procedures were conducted and gross error \ndetection applied to identify correlations with an increased likelihood of error.  \nRmse was also available as a method of assessing the overall triangulation \nperformances.  The triangulated blocks were edited to a predefined degree of \naccuracy, typically with ground control residuals restricted to within 0.1 m, before \nbeing accepted.  Once confirmed, the co-registration of images defines the \nrelationship between the internal geometry, external positions and orientations of \nthe sensor at the point of capture (Schenk, 1997).  Th\nim\nScanned point clouds were orientated through the same transformation \nmatrix used for the ground control points in order to enable comparability between \nmodels.  The Archaeoptics Demon software package was used to converge each \nscan to the next in the monthly monitoring sequence to remove any errors \nassociated with the external orientation of the scanner at the time of capture.  The \nconvergence operation processes the point clouds in two stages to find a least-\nsquares best fit between the three-dimensional coordinate sets.  Firstly every point \nin the first scan is searched for the point of closest Euclidean distance within the \nsecond scan.  The best fit between the paired data-sets is then calculated using a \nthree-dimensional transformation algorithm to determine the vector translation and \nquaternion required for an optimal transformation (Horn, 1987).  The rms \ndeviation between the two scans is then computed and if it is greater than the \ndesired deviation, the algorithm reiterates.  The weighting in Horn\u2019s (1987) \nsolution also limits the contribution of poor quality points, containing weaker \nmatches than surrounding pairs, to the overall transformation.  By specifying each \nmesh as non-deformable, the sequential epochs are drawn together based on the \nreduction of the distance separating the majority of points, ignoring the localised \nareas of genuine change.  By monitoring a section of cliff face of sufficient size to \navoid the influences of actual change to the cliff face, the errors as\nosition\n \nIn order to generate orthoimages, ASCII data files containing the X, Y and Z \ncoordinates of every point in the raster were interpolated into a surface DEM \nusing the ERDAS 3D surfacing tool.  Cell resolution was set to 0.05 m and a non-\nlinear rubber-sheeting interpolation was used to better reflect the actual contours \nof the cliff faces.  The high-resolution DEM was used to minimise the amount of \ninformation lost between the reconstructed surface, of finite interval, and the \nground surface (Huang, 2000).  The output TIFF file was then imported into \nOrthoBASE in order to correct for the distortions within the imagery caused by \nvariations in terrain elevation.  Orthorectification is the process of correcting raw \nimages to form a planimetrically true representation of the surface.  Accurately \northorectified images have a consistent photo scale, allowing real-world \nmeasurements to be taken of the subject matter (Schenk, 1997).  The images were \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 11 \nLIM. et al.

ERDAS OrthoBASE has a number of \ndefault terrain settings which can be applied to differing topographic situations \nwithin the same block (Table IV).  The presets were used to assess the effects on \nDEM production of the parameters of search area, correlation size, coefficient \nlimit, topographic relief type and land cover object type.  High levels of image \ntexture over cliff surfaces and the availability of adequate control allowed more \nstringent acceptance levels to be applied (Zhang and Miller, 1997).  The search \narea was lowered to the minimum allowable 5 \u00d7 5 pixels after the suggestion that \ntemplate size should be minimised over complex topography, despite the \npropensity for increased interpolation (Lane et al., 2000).

The laser point clouds were \ncollected in a variety of conditions and over a range of rock surface types, but all \nscans were statistically related to within 0.04 m convergence of the previous \nsurvey.   The result was a detailed three-dimensional impression of the cliff face in \nwhich the physical characteristics can be clearly identified and quantified (Fig. 2).  \nThe ortho-image of Site C demonstrates the ability to accurately locate and \nmonitor the cliff top and toe positions within the scans (subsections A and B).  \nImportant information was also generated on the processes, such as seepage from \n12 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \nied the loss of rock blocks as small as 0.1 m throughout the \nmonitored period, verified with the use of the ortho-imagery and stereo viewing of \ntrian\nite losing accuracy with increasing height up the cliff, the precision of the \nthe till above (subsection C) and on the mechanisms of failure, seen in the fresh \nrock face exposed following a recent fall (subsection D).  By resampling the \nrectified imagery with the laser-scanned point clouds, substantially larger portions \nof cliff face can be accurately monitored without multiplying errors of contrast, \nshadowing, perspective and geometry.  The cliff section at Site D for example \ncomprises a mosaic of six images and covers over 100 m of coastline (Fig. 3).  \nThe laser-scanned data performed well over gently curved topography such as the \npoints of headlands or backwalls of embayments.  The differencing of successive \nmodels reliably identif\ngulated blocks.    \n \nThe photogrammetrically produced DEMs were consistently sensitive to \nchange, precisely identifying topographic variations across the cliff face.  The \naccuracy of the photogrammetric models however varied considerably, depending \non the specifics of the triangulation used.  Comparisons between the \nphotogrammetrically derived DEMs and the laser-scanned surfaces highlight the \nadvantages of the integrated approach used.  A model of the difference between \nthe two techniques is illustrated for Site A (Fig 4).  The differences between the \nmodels increase with height and surface complexity, which in this instance is \nreflected in the increase in topographic roughness from left to right. The \ndifferences are particularly noticeable in the sharp protrusion in subsection \u201cA\u201d, in \nwhich weak control and radial distortion reduce matching performance.  Profiles \ntaken through both the laser and photogrammetric DEM surfaces demonstrate a \nbroad agreement in the overall cliff geometry, with the photogrammetry \nmarginally more sensitive to the small-scale undulations across the face.  The \nmost noticeable difference is the increasing disparities in depth above 10 m from \nthe cliff toe.  Editing the ground control within the blocks to refine the \ntriangulations consistently required the removal of points towards the upper \nsections of the cliff face.  Attempts to maintain the full constraints of the points in \nthe extremities of the overlap led to poor DEM performance despite the consistent \naccuracies of the control points with cliff height (Table III).  Removing the upper \ncontrol allowed high quality triangulations to be achieved but raised questions \nover the accuracies of the DEMs they would generate.  This suggests the \nphotogrammetric performance was limited not by the accuracies of the control, but \nby the reliance on natural features which become increasingly harder to match \ntowards the extremes of the images.  The inability of the stereo configuration of \nthe photography to gather sufficient image content for the bundle adjustment \nhighlights a major limitation of the photogrammetric application to monitoring \nhigh-sided cliff faces.  Software-based quality assessments identified suspicious \npixel matches as geometric irregularities but failed to detect any systematic errors \nin the triangulation.  The direct effect of perspective errors on elevation has \nlimited the use of photogrammetry in the study of rock slopes, which commonly \nrecede from the base.  Interestingly the subtle changes in the cliff face are still \ndetected in the upper portion of the photogrammetric DEMs.  The implication is \nthat desp\nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 13 \nLIM. et al.

Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \n \n \n \nThe nature of the target terrain also produced errors within the laser scans.  \nThe limited number of scans permitted by the tidal exposure of the monitoring \nstations raised concerns over the adequacy of the field of view of the cliff faces \nobtained by the scanner.  The reliability of the scanned results was tested by \ngenerating two 0.05 m resolution point clouds of the same cliff section in \nimmediate succession.  No changes were recorded during the scans, meaning that \ntwo theoretically identical surface representations should be produced.  The \ndifference model of the scans revealed small errors between the meshed surfaces, \nwhich typically appear as triangular irregularities caused by subtle differences in \nmesh generation (Fig. 5).  There are however more substantial geometric \ndifferences, highlighted in the subsection, that result from occlusion.  Such line-\nof-sight errors are concentrated towards the edges of scans and on protruding \nledges.  Although the errors caused are comparatively small, within 0.03 m, the \nbenefit of validating genuine change with the use of orthoimages is again realised.  \nIn this way sites can be characterised and problem areas such as ledges and \noverhangs identified for targeted checking of difference models. \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 15 \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \n \n \nIn terms of monitoring the present rate of cliff retreat, the integration of the \ntwo approaches has enabled changes to be accurately detected and assessed well \nbeyond the acceptable error margins for a purely photogrammetric approach.  \nOrthoimages and difference models were generated for the total change monitored \nacross two sites over a nine month period (Figs. 6a and b).  The resolution of the \ndata revealed that despite being located adjacent to one another (Fig. 1), the \nmechanisms determining change were markedly different.  Site A shows a \nrelatively even spatial distribution of change throughout the rock face, with small \nconcentrations within certain lithological bands in the mudstone toe and the \nweaker shales in the middle portion of the cliff.  Site B reveals significantly more \nconcentrated areas of difference with the majority of change occurring within \n16 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nLIM. et al.

A second band of change is \ndetected at the junction between the harder sandstone strata and the weaker shales \nbelow.  Incremental weathering of the shales reduces support for the sandstone \nledge resulting in the occasional loss of large angular rocks. \n \n \n \nThe changes detected across the two sites can be represented graphically, \ncalculating the area affected by the detachment of material as a percentage of the \ntotal two-dimensional area of the monitored cliff sections (Fig. 7).  This was done \nto enable comparisons of the rate of change between the two, despite the greater \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 17 \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \narea monitored at Site A.  The recorded changes display considerably different \ntemporal variations throughout the time series which spans from autumn through \nto the following spring.  Site A lost low percentages of material at relatively \nconsistent rates in terms of surface area affected from month to month.  There \nappears to be a weak seasonality to the volume losses with the autumn and late \nspring months found to be more stable than those of winter.  Site B shows a \nreversal of this temporal pattern, with changes not synchronised with the \nseasonally expected variance.  The spatial concentration of change at the cliff toe \nindicates that the cliff may be responding to localised controls such as wave \nimpact.  The influence that the different failure mechanisms exerted on the overall \ndevelopment of the cliffs is shown in the summary column showing the total \nsurface area affected as a percentage of the monitored rock face.  The strength of \nthe toe at Site A has restricted change to incremental and sporadic losses \nthroughout the cliff.  Failure of the toe at Site B by contrast has destabilised the \ncliff base, propagating instability up through the heavily jointed strata.  Temporary \nstability has been reached in the natural arch formations which appeared to \ngradually expand and coalesce. \n \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe mechanisms governing the evolution of hard rock cliffs are poorly \nunderstood due to the poor quality data-sets describing the changes that they \nundergo (Lee and Clark, 2002).  The pressing need for planning organisations and \n18 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \nmanagement strategies to make assessments based on an average rate of retreat \nhowever remains.  The suggested retreat rate for this area of coast, based on the \ncurrent aerial survey methods is 0.075m per annum.  The two main sites of this \nstudy have two-dimensional surface areas of 2520 m2 and 2130 m2 respectively.  \nThis would suggest the loss at Site A of 15.75 m3 and 13.31 m3 at Site B on \naverage every month.  The actual average changes recorded however were \nsignificantly lower at 6.80 m3 per month for Site A and 9.99 m3 per month for Site \nB.  At present it is not possible to say whether this is because of the low levels of \naccuracy associated with the conventional methods of cliff retreat analysis, or the \nepisodic nature of the cliff retreat process.  The data raises interesting questions \nover the interplay between events of low magnitude but high frequency, and less \nfrequent, larger scale losses from the cliff, and how they determine cliff form. \n \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 19 \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \n \nThe disparities between the general level for change set by aerial approaches \nand the reality of a more stable rock face are demonstrated in Fig. 8.  The over-\nestimation demonstrated by the comparison with actually monitored rates \nhighlights the limitations of averaging two-dimensional records of retreat for \nextensive sections of coastline.  Even across the two sites illustrated, just 350 m \napart, clear differences have been detected in the pattern and nature of failure \nevents.  These differences demonstrate that cliff retreat is a spatially and \ntemporally specific process.  The generation of high-resolution data-sets offers \nsignificant potential to subdivide existing classifications of cliffs and rock slopes \nin general to account for the local mechanisms of failure.   \n \n20 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \nThe integration of high-resolution photographic monitoring resampled with \nthe fixed accuracies of terrestrial laser surveys enables rock faces to be reliably \nmonitored and qualitatively assessed in a variety of conditions (Fig. 9).  \nSuccessful integration requires the careful consideration of the format, orientation \nand resolution of the outputs from both techniques.  Recent technological \ndevelopments are generating greater opportunities for the use of combinations of \ntechniques in order to overcome the challenges of monitoring geomorphological \nchange.  The Leica High-Definition Survey series and Riegl LMS range of time-\nof-flight laser scanners, for example, have the capability to capture colourised \npoint clouds.  Although such instruments are currently beyond the financial \nconstraints of many projects, particularly small-scale repeated monitoring surveys, \nin the foreseeable future the development of complete integrated capture systems \nwill hold enormous potential for geomorphological applications. \n \nIn this study it has been possible to consider in detail the spatial pattern of \nchange in three dimensions and to assess differences throughout the cliff face in \naddition to the landward retreat rates at the cliff top.  The ability to view \nvolumetric change across rock faces has enabled the investigation of the factors \nthat determine the contemporary evolution of the coastline at Staithes.  The \nrelative importance of different failure modes can be quantified for each specific \ncliff section.  The change detected within the basal 10 m of Site A for example \naccounted for only 11.7% of the total volume lost for the monitoring period.  The \ngeotechnical properties and lack of vertical jointing generate a highly resistant \ncliff toe.  The majority of material lost was restricted to the middle and upper \nsections of the cliff face which would remain unrecorded by aerial surveys.  The \nlower 10 m at Site B by contrast lost 36.4 m3 of material, 40.4% of the total \nrecorded recession.  It is clear from the spatial analysis of the patterns and \nquantities of changes that mitigation strategies such as armouring the cliff toe \nwould have a far greater impact at Site B than at Site A.  In this way development \nstrategies can be targeted to better meet the needs of coastal managers.  \n \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 21 \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \n \nWith the introduction of high-resolution data-sets detailing the changes \nacross rock faces over time, the opportunities to link detected differences to their \ncontrolling factors can also be explored.  Cliff face changes for example can be \nlinked to intense rainfall events or storm waves.  The varied responses of the \nmonitored sites to individual events reveal much about the sensitivity or resistance \nof each site to specific triggering mechanisms.  The significant differences in the \nvolume change recorded between the sites during September and October 2003 for \nexample (Fig. 7), may reflect a particularly destructive wave regime associated \nwith the strong easterly winds that buffeted the Yorkshire coast during these \nmonths.  By accurately and precisely monitoring contemporary cliff forms, \nobservations of materials and processes can be used to define, classify and model \ntheir evolution (Hantz et al., 2003).  In time, the collection of more extensive \ndatasets will adequately establish base levels for the characteristics and rates of \nchange.  Grounded in the background rates of change for contemporary recession \nprocesses, predictions of cliff responses to future impacts such as sea-level rise or \ncoastal defences could be made.  It is therefore important that the potential of new \n22 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nLIM. et al. Combined digital photogrammetry and time-of-flight laser scanning \n \ntechniques such as those examined here are adequately explored with respect to \nimproving our understanding of complex landforms such as hard rock cliffs.  \nUltimately, advances in understanding will only be achieved by increasing the \nnumber of accurately constrained monitoring datasets of high spatial and temporal \nresolution and then using them to establish new deterministic and probabilistic \nmodels of cliff evolution. \nCONCLUSIONS \nThis study has used rectified images resampled with consistent, accurate \nlaser-scanned data to monitor the monthly changes occurring over sections of the \nhard rock cliffs at Staithes, North Yorkshire.  Photogrammetric techniques proved \nsensitive to changes in cliff face topography despite the challenges posed by scale \nand nature of the environment.  This suggests that significant potential exists for \nthe application of digital photogrammetry to less extreme cliff heights.  The \ncombination of the precise and qualitative information generated by digital \nphotogrammetry and the extensive coverage and consistently high accuracies of \ntime-of-flight laser scanning provides an answer to the challenges of recording \nchange from large scale landforms in dynamic coastal environments.   \n \nThe changes detected here reveal the inadequacies of widely used aerial \nsurvey approaches in quantifying retreat in near-vertical coastal cliffs.  The \napparent stability of hard rock cliffs masks significant variability both between \nand within monitored sections, confirming the importance of a site-specific \napproach to forming an understanding of cliff change.  Distinct mechanisms of \nfailure have been identified and related to the volumes of material lost to \ndetermine their relative contribution to cliff form.  The data holds important \nimplications for the formulation of adequate coastal development strategies, which \nshould seek to combine the high-resolution terrestrial techniques presented here \nwith established aerial and obliquely captured information.  The solution to the \nchallenges of recording, quantifying and explaining cliff change therefore lies in \nthe continued development, integration and quality assessment of available \ntechniques. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to thank and acknowledge Cleveland Potash Limited for \nfunding this project.
