In particular, a number of agents\nhave been identified which attenuate or accelerate signalling\nthrough downstream pathways [1] but their mechanisms of action\nare frequently poorly understood. Here we focus on the\nfibronectin leucine rich transmembrane proteins (FLRTs): a\nsubclass of the larger diverse leucine rich repeat (LRR) superfamily\n[2] which act as multifunctional accelerators of fibroblast growth\nfactor receptor (FGFR) signalling. We, and others, have\ndemonstrated that: members of the FLRT family associate with\nmembers of the FGFR family, accentuate FGF-mediated signal-\nling via the Ras\/Raf\/ERK pathway and play a role in cadherin-\ndependent homotypic cell adhesion functions [3,4,5]. A key issue\nin further understanding the function of FLRTs is to determine the\ninter-relationships between these three cardinal properties.\nThree members of the FLRT family (FLRT 1\u20133) have been\nidentified in higher vertebrates from functional screens and in\nsilico searches [6]. They exhibit canonical fibronectin and leucine\nrich repeat motifs in the extracellular domain which mediate the\nhomotypic cell adhesion functions; a single transmembrane\ndomain and a short (,100 amino acid) cytoplasmic domain\ndevoid of overt signalling motifs. Each FLRT family member\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e10264\nexhibits characteristic and restricted patterns of expression in the\ndeveloping embryo [3,4,7]. FLRT1, the subject of this study, is\nexpressed in adult brain and kidney [6] and, in embryonic\ndevelopment, is localized in the midbrain at the boundary with the\nhindbrain and in the dorsal diencephelon adjacent to the\ntelencephalon, the eye, dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia and in\ncells adjacent to the urogenital ridge [4]. This pattern overlaps\nwith regions of FGFR and FGF ligand expression suggestive of a\nspecific requirement for interaction of the FGF and FLRT axis in\nthese cell types. Indeed a potential role for FLRT action in\nneuronal function has been proposed from studies of FLRT3\nexpression in neural regeneration models [8,9,10].\nIn this work we set out to further understand the functional\nrelationship between FGFR activation and FLRT function via an\ninitial analysis of FGFR-mediated phosphorylation of FLRT1. We\nshow that phosphorylation of FLRT1 in the cytoplasmic domain\nmodulates the ability of FLRT to activate the MAPK pathway and\ninduce neurite outgrowth. A non-phosphorylated form of FLRT1\nacts as a chronic activator of FGFR1 signalling and both signalling\npropagation and induction of neurite outgrowth require the\nactivity of a non-receptor Src family kinase.\nResults\nFLRT1 and FGFR1 are co-localized\nWe have previously documented an association between\nFGFR1 and FLRT1 [4] and we were interested to learn the\ncellular location(s) of this interaction. Cos-7 cells transiently co-\ntransfected with FGFR1 and FLRT1 demonstrated clear co-\nlocalisation in punctate perinuclear intracellular vesicles\n(Figure 1A, thick white arrows, upper and lower panels) and at\nthe cell surface membrane (Figure 1A, thin white arrows, lower\npanels). This data shows that FGFR1 and FLRT1 localise to\nsimilar multiple cellular compartments.\nFGFR1 phosphorylates FLRT1\nThis pattern of co-localisation raised the possibility that FLRT1\ncould be a potential substrate for ligand-mediated FGFR1\nphosphorylation which could, in principle, regulate FLRT\nfunction. Co-transfection of FGFR1 and FLRT1 in 293T cells\nresults in robust ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of\nFLRT1 (Figure 1B), probably as a consequence of elevated\nreceptor population and ligand-independent FGFR1 activation,\nshowing that either FGFR1 itself or other downstream kinases can\nutilise FLRT1 as a substrate.\nBioinformatic analysis of theoretical tyrosine phosphorylation\nsites on the C-terminal region of FLRT1 (NetPhos 2.0 http:\/\/\nwww.cbs.dtu.dk\/ services\/NetPhos\/) revealed 3 high probability\nresidues, Y600, Y633 and Y671. A panel of single, double and the\ntriple tyrosine substitution constructs was produced and examined\nfor expression and localisation in transfected 293T cells. In all\ncases, protein was localized at both the plasma membrane and in\nintracellular vesicular-like structures (data not shown) suggesting\nthat mutation of these cytoplasmic tyrosine residues to phenylal-\nanine did not grossly perturb FLRT1 expression or intracellular\ntrafficking. Mutation of these tyrosine residues in FLRT1\ndecreased FGFR1-mediated FLRT1 tyrosine phosphorylation\ncompared to wild -type in all cases (Figure 2A). The single\ntyrosine deletion constructs Y600F-FLRT1, Y633F-FLRT1,\nY671F-FLRT1 and the double mutant (Y600, 633F) Y2F-FLRT1\nexhibit reduced, but not abolished, phosphorylation (,34%,\n,32%, ,36% and ,42% inhibition, respectively) whereas the\ntriple mutant (Y3F-FLRT1) exhibited almost complete abolition of\ntyrosine phosphorylation (Figure S1) equivalent to that observed\nby pharmacological inhibition [11] of FGFR1 kinase with SU5402\n(,88% and ,96% inhibition, respectively). These results establish\nthat Y600 , Y633 and Y671 are critical for FGFR1-mediated\nphosphorylation of FLRT1, each site is phosphorylated and\nFGFR1 activation is necessary and sufficient for FLRT1\nphosphorylation. These findings also predict that Y3F-FLRT1 is\ndefective in a process (or processes) which require phosphorylation\nof the 3 critical tyrosines.\nWe next sought to further characterise the kinase(s) responsible\nfor FGFR1 mediated phosphorylation of FLRT1 using a\npharmacological approach (Figure 2B). We were particularly\ninterested in the role of SFKs in view of our previous findings\n[12,13] that Src activation is a consequence of FGFR1 activation\nand Src activity is required for both receptor activation and\nmediation of downstream signalling dynamics. We observed, as\nbefore, almost complete inhibition of FLRT1 phosphorylation in\nthe presence of SU5402 (Figure 2B). We also observed significant\n(83%) inhibition in the presence of the SFK inhibitor SU6656 [14]\n(Figure S1) comparable to that observed in the Y3FFLRT1\ndeletion construct (,83% compared to ,88%). In parallel ERK\nactivation was significantly reduced in the presence of SU5402 or\nSU6656 which reflected the effect on FLRT1 phosphorylation.\nThese data confirm that FLRT1 phosphorylation is FGFR-\ndependent and implicate an SU6656-sensitive SFK in the\nphosphorylation mechanism.\nSince Src kinase acts both upstream and downstream of FGFR1\nactivation we next tested whether FLRT1 was a direct substrate for\nSrc. Constitutively active (KA-Src (Y527F) and kinase-dead (KD-\nSrc (K295M\/Y527F)) Src were co-expressed with FLRT1 which\nwas tested for tyrosine phosphorylation (Figure 2C). This revealed a\nvery low degree of FLRT1 phosphorylation (even after 1006longer\nthan normal exposure times) which was suppressed by the FGFR1\nkinase inhibitor SU5402, as was the ability of KA-Src to activate\nERK via phosphorylation. We conclude from these results that\nFLRT1 is a poor substrate for Src kinase and that Src regulates\nFLRT phosphorylation indirectly by virtue of the ability of KA-Src\nto activate FGFR signalling in the absence of ligand [12].\nY3F-FLRT1 induces chronic ERK activation\nHaving established that FLRT1 is a target for FGFR1-mediated\nphosphorylation we sought to examine the role of FLRT1\nphosphorylation in the FGF-mediated ERK response [3] from\nan endogenous FGFR population. 293T cells were transfected\nwith either FLRT1 or Y3F-FLRT1 triple mutant form and tested\nfor the dynamics of ERK activation in response to FGF\nstimulation (Figure 2D). In accord with previous results, FLRT1\nexpression enhanced the FGF response both at early (1min) and\nlater time points (30 min). Much to our surprise, expression of\nY3F-FLRT1 resulted in chronic stimulation of the ERK pathway\nboth in the absence and presence of ligand. These results suggested\nthat the phosphorylation-defective form of FLRT1 emulated the\naction of FGF in activating ERK signalling. Given that FLRT1\nand FGFR1 coassociate we reasoned that the action of Y3F-\nFLRT1 might arise from activation of FGFR1. 293T cells were\ntransfected with Y3F-FLRT1 and tested for ERK activation in the\npresence of pharmacological inhibitors of FGFR kinase (SU5402)\nand Src (SU6656). This revealed (Figure 2E) that the ability of\nY3F-FLRT1 to elicit ERK activation is completely dependent on\nboth FGFR and Src family kinase activity.\nThus the biochemical evidence reveals that FLRT1 is a target\nfor Src-dependent FGFR-mediated phosphorylation and abolition\nof FLRT phosphorylation, by mutation of the substrate tyrosine\nresidues, resulted in chronic ligand-independent yet FGFR1de-\npendent ERK activation. This suggests a futile cycle relationship\nFGFR1 and FLRT1 Regulation\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e10264\nbetween FLRT1 and FGFR1 which is mediated by Src. The non-\nphosphorylated form of FLRT1 may activate FGFR1 via Src [12]\nresulting in phosphorylation of FLRT1.\nFLRT1 promotes neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells\nHaving established a functional interaction between FGFR1\nand FLRT1 by biochemical approaches we next sought to study\nthe functional consequences in a physiological setting. Given the\nevidence for regulated expression and function of FLRT3 in\nneuronal cell types [8,9,10] and the known role of FGFR\nsignalling in neuronal function [15,16,17,18] we elected to study\nthe induction of neurite outgrowth in the SH-SY5Y cell line\n[19,20]. Confluent cells were transfected with GFP (control) and\neither FLRT1 or Y3F-FLRT1 alone or in conjunction with\nFigure 1. Co-localization of FLRT1 and FGFR1.

Cell morphology and neuronal characteristics were then\nanalysed in a variation of the Scholl analysis [21] (Figure S2). Cells\nwere designated as polar, bipolar, pyramidal or multi-polar\ndepending upon cell shape and the number of primary processes.\nExpression of either FLRT1 or Y3F-FLRT1 alone or co-\nexpression with FGFR1 results in a significantly higher proportion\nof multi-polar cells and concomitant decreased numbers of other\nneuron types (Figure 3A). This is consistent with the significantly\nincreased number of processes observed under these conditions\n(Figure 3B, upper left panel).\nExpression of FLRT1 alone results in significant increases in the\nnumber of processes per cell (,68%) and the total dendritic length\n(,31%) compared to GFP control (Figure 3B). There was no\nsignificant difference in either the length of the longest process or\nthe maximum diameter of the cell (including processes \u2013 Scholl\ndiameter). This is consistent with the reported actions of FLRT\nexpression on neuronal function [8,10] possibly mediated via a cell\nadhesion mechanism.\nIn contrast, both FLRT1\/FGFR1 co-expression and Y3F-\nFLRT1 expression results in comparable and significant increases\nnot only in the number of processes (,83% and ,66%,\nrespectively) and the total dendritic length (,267% and ,277%,\nrespectively), but also in the length of the longest process (,153%\nand ,183%, respectively) and the Scholl diameter (,70% and\n,81%, respectively) compared to GFP control (Figure 3B).\nComparison of FLRT1 and Y3F-FLRT1 showed a significant\nincrease in all parameters except the number of processes (,68%\nand ,66%, respectively). Neurite outgrowth was completely\nblocked in the presence of inhibitors of the MAPK pathway\n(U0126), FGFR1 (SU5402) and SFKs (SU6656) (Figure S6).\nThere was a significant increase in the length of the longest\nprocess and total dendritic length when Y3F-FLRT1 and FGFR1\nwere co-expressed (,55% and ,98%, respectively) compared to\nGFP. Y3F-FLRT1\/FGFR1 co-expression exhibited significant\nreductions in all parameters when compared to either FLRT1\/\nFGFR1 or Y3F-FLRT1 expressing cells whilst in contrast there\nwas a significant decrease in process number and increase in\nlongest process when Y3F-FLRT1\/FGFR1 were compared to\nFLRT1 expressing cells (Figure 3B).\nDendritic architecture, the number and frequency of intersec-\ntions and spines, is critical to the morphology and function of\nneuronal cells. Using a variation on the Scholl analysis, the\nnumber of spines and intersections was quantified as a function of\ndistance from the soma (per 10mm). Despite some significant\nincreases in dendritic complexity (Table S1), particularly for\nFLRT1 (0\u201310mm), Y3F-FLRT1 (0\u201330mm) and FLRT1\/FGFR1\n(0\u201340mm) expressing cells, there was no change in the radial\nprofile of dendritic complexity with the peak remaining in the first\n10mm and steadily declining with increased distance from the cell\nbody (Figure 3C). The rather surprising results we observed when\ncomparing FLRT1 only expression with Y3F-FLRT1\/FGFR1 co-\nexpression suggest that up-regulation of FGFR1 can counteract\nthe effect of deregulating FLRT1 phosphorylation. Whilst\nsuggestive of a bipartite mechanism, this remains unclear and\nfurther analysis will be required to resolve completely the functions\nof FLRT that are FGFR-dependent\/independent.\nTogether these data define two features of FLRT1 action in this\nneuronal cell model. Dendritic architecture is regulated by FLRT1\nalone whereas the length and complexity of dendrites is regulated\nby the signalling functions of FLRT1 acting in concert with\nFGFR1 activation.\nFLRT1 promotes dendritic outgrowth in primary\nhippocampal neurons\nTo determine effects of FLRT1 on a primary neuron\npopulation, and confirm elevated activity of the Y3F-FLRT\nmutant, cultures of developing rat hippocampal neurons were\ntransfected. These neurons have a single axon and a number of\ndendrites emerging from the cell body or soma (primary dendrites)\nand express both FGFR1 and FGFR2 (RR and IM submitted).\nFollowing transfection, dendrites were identified with anti-MAP2b\nand transfected cells with anti-HA antibodies and the number of\ndendrites projecting from cell bodies were counted. Both FLRT1\nand Y3F-FLRT1 produced a statistically significant increase in\nnumbers of primary dendrites compared to the control vector\nexpressing GFP. Moreover, the Y3F-FLRT1 variant generated\nmore primary dendrites than the normal FLRT1 protein\n(Figure 4).

There was a\nsmall amount of pFGFR1 and FLRT1 association confined to the\ncell body membrane and the central regions of processes\n(Figure 5A and Figure S4A).\nFollowing FGF2 (5min) stimulation, pFGFR1 localization was\nstill observed in vesicular structures within the cell body and the\ncentral and peripheral regions of processes and prominently co-\nlocalized with both FLRT1 and pSFK (as determined by Y416\nphosphorylation) in the peripheral regions of processes (Figure 5B\nand see Figure S4B). Prolonged (30min) stimulation with FGF2\nresults in transport of the majority of pFGFR to intracellular\nvesicular structures within the cell body where it co-localizes with\nFLRT1 and pSFK (Figure 5C and Figure S4C).\nStriking differences were observed when Y3F-FLRT1 was co-\nexpressed with FGFR1. pFGFR co-localizes with Y3F-FLRT1\nand pSFK in both intracellular vesicles within the cell body and\nthe central and peripheral regions of processes. Very little pFGFR\nco-localization with pSFK was observed independently of Y3F-\nFLRT1, contrasting sharply with observations from FLRT1-\nexpressing cells. All of pFGFR, Y3F-FLRT1 and pSFK remained\nco-localized in the central and peripheral regions of the processes,\nand to a lesser degree within the cell body (Figure 5D\u2013F and\nFigure S4D\u2013F). In this respect cells co-expressing Y3F-FLRT1\n(Figure 5D) closely resemble cells co-expressing FLRT1 and\nFGFR1 subjected to FGF stimulation (Figure 5C).\nCollectively these data from a neuronal cell line confirm our\nbiochemical observations. Stimulation of cells by FGF ligand\nresults in activation of SFK(s) in peripheral locations and co-\nlocalisation of pSFK, pFGFR and FLRT1 which traffic to the cell\nbody. This resembles our previous study of FGFR activation in\nMEFs in which FGF stimulation results in peripheral co-activation\nof FGFR and Src phosphorylation. In MEFs, activated Src\nremains confined to the periphery whilst FGFR is trafficked to\nperinuclear Rab5+ve vesicles [22]. In the FLRT1 expression\nmodel employed here, activated FGFR1 is also trafficked from the\nperiphery to perinuclear locations but FLRT1 is never associated\nwith Rab5+ve vesicles Figure S5).\nIn the case of Y3F-FLRT1 the 3 molecules are \u2018\u2018pre-localized\u2019\u2019\nin intracellular perinuclear vesicles consistent with the ability of\nY3F-FLRT1 to activate FGFR1 signalling via a SFK-mediated\nmechanism.\nDiscussion\nIn this report we have studied the functional interaction\nbetween the FGFR and its binding partner, the signal accelerator,\nFLRT1. We observe that tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic\ndomain are targets for FGFR-mediated phosphorylation and\nidentify the residues involved. We show that mutation of the\nresidues has the unexpected consequence of yielding a form of\nFLRT1 which has the property of eliciting chronic ligand-\nindependent yet FGFR-dependent MAP Kinase activation. Y3F-\nFLRT1 is therefore a constitutive activator of FGFR signalling to\nMAP Kinase. One apparent functional consequence of FGFR-\nmediated phosphorylation may be to suppress the FGFR1\npotentiation function of FLRT1. The FLRT\/FGFR partnership\ntherefore resembles a futile cycle in which FLRT-mediated\nactivation of FGFR results in suppression of activation by feedback\nphosphorylation. Futile cycle mechanisms are classically held to\nexhibit super-sensitivity to input [23,24] which is what we observe\nin the case of FGF. This mechanism therefore explains the ability\nof wild type FLRT1 to markedly accelerate the early phase of\nligand-mediated signalling: this phase may represent the time\nrequired for FLRT1 to switch phosphorylation states.\nThe second finding in this report is that the connection between\nFLRT1 and FGFR1 may be moderated by a non-receptor tyrosine\nkinase of the Src family. FLRT1 is not a direct substrate for Src\nkinase but SFK activity is required for FGFR1-mediated FLRT1\nphosphorylation. Conversely a SFK is implicated in the ability of\nY3F-FLRT1 to activate the FGFR. We have previously shown that\nactivated Src utilises FGFR as a substrate and pharmacological\ninhibition of Src resulted in prolonged ERK activation due to\ninhibition of signal decay [12]. This suggests the ability of\nY3FFLRT1 to activate FGFR signalling is indirect arising from\nactivation of Src kinase implying that a second consequence of\nFLRT1 phosphorylation is suppression of its ability to activate Src.\nWithin this context, Src activation may be negatively regulated by\none or more of the three tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of\nFLRT. We note that one target, Y600, is located adjacent to a\ncanonical PXXP SH3 domain binding motif and it has been\nreported in other systems that tyrosine phosphorylation events in the\nproximity of an SH3 recognition motif suppress the interaction [25].\nAlthough this is an attractive mechanism none of the single or\ndouble mutant forms of FLRT1 exhibit MAPK activation\nsuggesting that the action of de-phosphorylated FLRT1 results\nfrom the concerted action of all three phosphorylated residues.\nWhilst this data is consistent with, and provides some evidence for,\nthe involvement of a SFK in the regulation of FGFR1 via FLRT1,\nfurther studies are needed to investigate and clarify the role of SFKs\nin the regulation and localisation of the FLRT1-FGFR1 interde-\npendent signalling mechanism.\nWe showed that the interaction between FGFR1 and FLRT1 has\nfunctional consequences in both the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell model\nand primary hippocampal neurons. Expression of FLRT1 alone\ninduces a multi-polar phenotype whereas expression of Y3F-FLRT1\nor co-expression of FLRT1 and FGFR1 induced both a multi-polar\nphenotype and elevated neurite outgrowth involving activation of\nthe MAP Kinase pathway. The FLRT1-mediated increase in\nprimary processes seen in the SH-SY5Y line was also seen in\nelevated numbers of primary dendrites in hippocampal neuron\ncultures and the increased signalling activity of the Y3-FLRT1\nprotein was reflected in a significant further increase in dendrite\nproduction above that seen with FLRT1. Importantly, perturbation\nof FLRT1 phosphorylation resulted in deregulated localisation of the\nFigure 3. FLRT1 promotes neurite outgrowth in vitro.

These findings suggest a dual\nrole for FLRT family proteins in neuronal function: one function is\nmediated by the action of FLRT alone, presumably reflecting\nconsequences of its cell adhesion properties and the second arising\nfrom activation of signal transduction pathways involving SFK(s) and\nFGFR1. Although we appreciate the caveat of overexpression\nsystems and promiscuous signalling with regard to interpretation of\nthis study in terms of physiologically relevant FGFR1-FLRT1\ninteractions, it should be noted that FLRT3 was up-regulated in\nresponse to both axotomisation and neuronal injury [8,9] and it has\nbeen suggested that FLRT proteins play a role in neuronal\nregeneration mechanisms when they are induced and FLRT\npopulation at the membrane is elevated.

Images were acquired on a Leica confocal\nmicroscope and processed using Image J and Adobe Photoshop\n6.0 and represent 3 independent experiments. Scale bar: 20mm.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0010264.s005 (5.74 MB TIF)\nFigure S6 Pharmacological Inhibition of neurite outgrowth in\nthe SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with GFP\n(control), FLRT1-HA or Y3F-FLRT1-HA and simultaneously\ntreated with inhibitors (U0126, MEK inhibitor; SU5402, FGFR\ninhibitor; SU6656, SFK inhibitor; SB203580, p38 MAPK\ninhibitor). After 48 hours of treatment, cells were analysed by\ndirect confocal microscopy (in the case of GFP-expressing cells) or\nstained for anti-HA (FLRT1 and Y3F-FLRT1, green, middle and\nright hand panels respectively). Inhibition of the p38 MAPK had\nno visible effect on either cell morphology or the ability of either\nFLRT1 or Y3F-FLRT1 to promote neurite outgrowth. Inhibition\nof either MEK\/ERK (U0126) or SFK (SU6656) signalling resulted\nin a complete loss of neurite outgrowth from the cells consistent\nwith evidence in the literature that has implicated SFKs and ERK\nas critical processes for neurite extension. In line with our model of\nFLRT1-mediated modulation of FGFR1 signalling, inhibition of\nthe receptor by SU5402 prevented neurite outgrowth in both the\ncontrol and FLRT1 expressing cells. In contrast, neurite\noutgrowth in cells expressing Y3F-FLRT1, which is receptor-\nindependent for activation of ERK, was unaffected by SU5402\ntreatment. Images were acquired on a Leica confocal microscope,\nImage J and Adobe Photoshop 6.0 were used to process captured\ndata.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0010264.s006 (2.95 MB TIF)\nTable S1 Statistical summary of SH-SY5Y dendritic architec-\nture analysis by non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc\nDunns test.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0010264.s007 (0.05 MB\nDOC)\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Alicia Hidalgo and Victoria Heath for comments on the\nmanuscript and Melissa Grant for SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: LMW IM PWR JH.
