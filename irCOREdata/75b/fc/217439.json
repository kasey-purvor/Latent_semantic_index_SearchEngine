To date such discussions \nhave tended to focus on national leadership (Bor, 2007; Parkhurst and Lush, \n2004). Yet many of the settings in which HIV\/AIDS flourishes are \ngeographically distant from the reach of national leadership and policies \u2013 in \nthe context of relatively weak state structures. Furthermore local leaders often \nplay a key role in shaping how national policies and decisions are interpreted \nand implemented in local areas. \n \nWe present on a case study of a community-led HIV\/AIDS programme in \nStoneyridge, a rural South African community, where local leadership style \nemerged as a key influence on how AIDS was perceived and managed. Rural \nareas are home to 65% of people in SSA, and 45% of South Africans. Whilst \nHIV-prevalence rates tend to be lower in rural than urban areas, rural \nhouseholds carry the burden of care of migrants returning home to die. \nFurthermore, rural people often have restricted access to hospitals, clinics \nand treatment. The demands of AIDS care often lead to the physical and \npsychological burnout of carers, family breakdown and destruction of \nhousehold economies. \n \nThe Stoneyridge Project \n \nStoneyridge (a pseudonym) is a remote area covering 300 square kilometres, \nlocated some distance from towns and workplaces. Its 21 000 inhabitants \nstruggle against poverty and drought, low literacy and few opportunities for \npaid work. Distance and transport costs limit access to formal health services \nand anti-retroviral treatment, in a context where 35% of pregnant women are \nHIV positive. Unpaid and poorly trained health volunteers provide the only \nhelp and support available to many dying of AIDS. Whilst AIDS deaths are \n 3 \ncommon, stigma is rife, deterring many from seeking what little help is \navailable.  \n \nThe wider context of this paper is the Stoneybridge Project, a three-year \nintervention (2004-2007) which sought to strengthen the capacity of local \nresidents to respond more effectively to AIDS. Run by an external NGO with \nforeign funding, its goal was to build local initiative and capacity to deliver \nHIV-prevention and AIDS-care services through a three pronged project: \nfirstly to train volunteers in peer education and home-based nursing skills; \nsecondly to build support structures for the volunteers, both within the \ncommunity and with appropriate government health and welfare agencies and \nNGOs in the wider region; thirdly to use project involvement in the project as a \nspringboard for the more general empowerment of women and youth \nparticipants (disproportionately affected by HIV\/AIDS) through enhancing their \nproject management skills, their ability to access support and resources from \noutside government agencies and appropriate NGOs, and their capacity to \nparticipate in wider community decision-making.   \n \nThese goals were framed by a wider commitment to developing an \u2018AIDS \ncompetent community\u2019 (Nhamo et al., this volume) in which local people \nwould be most likely to work collaboratively for behaviour change, stigma \nreduction and optimal support for people with AIDS and their carers. Such a \nsetting provides opportunities for the development of appropriate knowledge \nand skills, as well as \u2018transformative social spaces\u2019 (Campbell and Scott, \n2010) in which local people can engage in dialogue with liked and trusted \npeers. Ideally such dialogue provides opportunities for community members \nto: develop critical understandings of how culture, poverty and gender \ninequalities hinder effective community responses to AIDS; develop a sense \nof \u2018ownership\u2019 of the problem rather than waiting passively for outsiders to \nsolve it; identify and develop confidence in local individual and group \nstrengths for tackling HIV\/AIDS; and identify and network with outside \nagencies best equipped to support them in responding more effectively to the \nchallenges of prevention and care. \n \n 4 \nThis approach is consistent with the fairly standard \u2018empowerment via \nparticipation\u2019 agenda of South African and international AIDS policy. Our case \nstudy examines how local leadership styles and practices facilitated or \nhindered the progress of the project, directly and indirectly. By \u2018direct\u2019 impact \nwe refer to the contribution of Stoneyridge\u2019s traditional chief to project \nactivities. \u2018Indirectly\u2019 we examine the extent to which the chief\u2019s general \nleadership style contributed to a social environment that was supportive of the \ndevelopment of AIDS competence. \n \nLeadership in Stoneyridge \n \nStoneyridge is one of 270 South African areas governed by a dual leadership \nsystem, with power shared between elected municipal officials and an \nunelected traditional chief. Central government distributes most of the public \nmoney available to rural areas through municipality structures, giving them \npower over essential services (water, roads) and social development. \nTraditional chiefs hold the power to allocate land, resolve disputes and govern \nthe daily lives of residents.  \n \nAn uneasy tension often exists between municipal and traditional authorities, \nespecially because municipalities are often governed by the ruling African \nNational Congress (ANC), with most chiefs supporting the opposition Inkatha \nFreedom Party (IFP). Beall et al. (2005, 2006) outlines three ways Chiefs \nhave negotiated this tension. Some support the ANC and work comfortably \nwith local municipalities. Some, less favourably disposed to the ANC, take a \npragmatic approach, reluctantly co-operating with municipalities to maximise \ntheir access to resources for their local areas. Others, including the \nStoneyridge chief, actively work to limit their subjects\u2019 access to municipal \nservices and resources, hoping that they will eventually win the wider fight by \ntraditional leaders to control what are currently municipal resources (Oomen, \n2005). \n \nNtsebeza (2006) roots the authority of chiefs in their power to allocate or \nwithhold land from their subjects. Land is obviously a vital resource where \n 5 \npeople depend on subsisdence farming for survival. However, much of \nStoneyridge is hilly and stony, particularly difficult to farm in recent years of \ndrought. There is growing discontent, particularly amongst the youth. In such \na context, the Chief has fallen back on his role as \u2018custodian of tradition\u2019 to \nhold power and authority. His celebration of traditional social relations \nincluding polygamy, bridewealth, obedient women, disciplined youth and the \nabsolute authority of the chief and his headmen, is enthusiastically embraced \nby many subjects, particularly older people and men. \n \nMethodology \n \nOur three-year longitudinal study of the Stoneybridge Project took the form of \n134 interviews and 57 focus group discussions (with 279 participants) with a \nwide range of local residence, as well as 70 fieldworker diaries. The research \nfor this paper involved trawling through this dataset and pulling out any \ninformation on three broad topics: the Chief\u2019s leadership style, its direct \nimpact on Project progress, and its indirect impact on project progress. These \ntopics form the headings of our \u2018Findings\u2019 section below. \n \nFINDINGS \n \nThe Chief\u2019s Leadership Style \n \nMany Stoneyridge residents spoke proudly of the Chief as educated and \ncharismatic man, articulate, worldly and wealthy, a descendant of a \ndistinguished lineage of chiefs. Particularly older people and men spoke \napprovingly of his strict authoritarian style, and his effective control of crime. \nThey cited his emphasis on traditional culture as a tremendous source of \npositive social cohesion in an uncertain social world. The Chief was \nassociated with positive social development in his two particular areas fo \ninterest: schooling and football. As a result of all these factors he commanded \nhuge respect as a unifying force.  \n \nThe Chief\u2019s Direct Support for the Project \n 6 \n \nFrom the outset, the Chief welcomed the Stoneyridge Project, allowing it to \noperate freely on the strict condition that it was apolitical. The Project had \nmany achievements. Volunteers were trained to deliver home-nursing, young \npeople to deliver peer education. Some progress was made in linking local \nhealth volunteers to public sector and NGO support agencies outside fo the \ncommunity. Given the chief\u2019s supreme power to control every aspect of \naccess to and life in Stoneyridge, these achievements would have been \nimpossible without his active support, and his nomination of a trusted local \nheadman to facilitate project activities on his behalf. \n \nFor the Project\u2019s first two years, he supported the project from a distance. In \nits third year he arranged for the Project to support his five wives in AIDS-\nawareness, and attended their \u2018graduation ceremony\u2019 (the formal distribution \nof training certificates at a high profile social event), and attended the opening \nof the Project\u2019s drop-in centre. This was a key boost for project activities in the \nface of the stigma and denial which constantly challenged its progress. At \nboth events he gave eloquent speeches praising the Project\u2019s work. \n \nHowever, whilst project workers were jubilant at his involvement, it was also \nclear that his style of engagement was at variance with the project\u2019s \nempowerment goals. A key goal was to build the capacity of local people, \nespecially women, to take control of their own lives and their own sexuality. \nYet it turned out that he had not consulted the wives about participating in the \ntraining. They were extremely agitated when the Project trainer arrived to \ndiscuss the timing of the course. Furthermore, in his speeches at project \nevents he frequently referred to his five wives and four girlfriends in a \nhumourous celebration of his masculinity. \n \nIn his speech at the wives graduation, the Chief said they needed to be taught about AIDS so \nthey should not blame him when any of them got infected. He confidently asserted that \npolygamy had nothing to do with AIDS:  \u2018If I am faithful to all of my wives and they are faithful \nto me, who is going to infect any of us with HIV?\u2019 he asked. He also said that it was mostly the \nyouth, and gay men, that were infected and they didn\u2019t practice polygamy. So people must \n 7 \nstop saying polygamy increased the chance of infection. The headmen and other men agreed \nwith him, laughing at his clever way of justifying himself. (Fieldworker diary) \n \nProject workers, who battled to involve headmen and adult men in project \nactivities saw the Chief\u2019s ability to engage male interest through jokes about \nmasculinity as a useful way of getting men to start talking about AIDS. \nHowever a more analytical perspective suggested that his humorous \ndiscussions of AIDS sent out confusing messages that contradicted the \nproject\u2019s goal of getting men to take greater responsibility for their role in \nspreading it, and empowering women to be more assertive about using \ncondoms with polygamous or unfaithful husbands. To quote further from the \nFieldworker diary: \n \nIn his speech, the Chief also referred to his four girlfriends, saying this was the first time he \nhad referred to them openly in front of his wives\u2026\u2026. He said he doesn\u2019t encourage any of \nthem to do family planning, saying: \u2018When I am dead, I don\u2019t want God to say I still have \nunborn children inside me.\u2019 \n \nHe frequently aired his views of \u2018correct behaviour\u2019: sexual abstinence for \nyoung people, faithfulness of wives, and multiple partners for men (who would \nnot be at risk of HIV so long as their virtuous wives and girlfriends were \nfaithful to them). He disapproved of condom use by youth, saying that they \nshould protect themselves with \u2018good behaviour\u2019, and advocated frequent \nvirginity testing of girls as the best method of HIV-prevention amongst youth. \n \nHe played an active role in policing and punishing young women who wore \njeans, justifying his determination to control their attire as part of his \ncommitment to culture, tradition and respect. \n \nIf we wear jeans, the Chief chases us and beats us with a whip. He says its only prostitutes \nthat wear jeans\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Older people and the headmen report us to him if they see us \nwearing jeans. (Health volunteers focus group) \n \nHis commitment to a highly conservative interpretation of culture and tradition \nshaped the focus of his messages about AIDS. Its heavy emphasis on the \n 8 \ncontrol and submission of youth and women stood at variance to the Project\u2019s \ninterest in promoting women\u2019s empowerment. \n \nIndirect Impact of Community Leadership on the Project \n \nThe project did not achieve its goals of involving widespread participation of \nlocal people in its work, or of using AIDS service work as a springboard for the \nsocial development or empowerment of youth or women. After three years, \nthere was no increase in women\u2019s confidence to negotiate safer sexual \nencounters, even amongst health volunteers. The project continued to be \ndominated by a powerful older man, although nearly all the volunteers were \nyounger women. Clearly many factors fed into such disappointments, \nincluding the peoples\u2019 growing unwillingness to act as unpaid volunteers, and \nthe poor support of external health and welfare agencies. These fall beyond \nthe scope of this paper, which is limited to how the local style of leadership \nimpacted on project efforts. We now turn to examine the strategies used by \nthe Chief to consolidate his power, and how these framed the social \nenvironment in which the Project was located. \n \nExclusion of \u2018ANC elements\u2019 from Stoneyridge: The historical rivalry \nbetween the ruling ANC, and the Chief\u2019s more traditional IFP, impacted on the \nProject in many indirect ways.  \n \nThe Chief likes development but he won\u2019t accept ideas coming from other areas, saying that \nthey are \u2018politically motivated\u2019. Before anything can be done here it has to be studied very \ncarefully to make sure it won\u2019t further the interests of other political parties. (Health volunteer) \n \nFear of being \u2018accused\u2019 of being an ANC supporter limited the development of \ninitiative by local people, and of the development of critical debate about how \nthe local status of women and youth undermined their opportunities for sexual \nhealth. \n \n 9 \nIdeology of self-reliance: One of the ways in which the Chief steered his \nsubjects away from seeking out municipal resources was through his ideology \nof \u2018self-reliance\u2019. \n \nMy vision for this community is one of self-reliance. People need to pick themselves up out of \ntheir poverty rather than waiting for help to come to them. (Interview with Chief) \n \nThis ideology works well in some areas of community life. Local people had \nworked for no pay to build schools and football fields. However health \nvolunteers suggested it was less appropriate in other settings. \n \nOur chief says people should survive through growing food. But its dry, nothing grows. He \nhasn\u2019t visited the households or seen the poverty affecting us. (Volunteer) \n \nHe refused to allow us to accept food parcels from the municipality for people with AIDS, \nsaying people should be given seeds, not handouts. Yet some people are too sick to grow \nseeds. (Volunteer) \n \nSelective use of democratic consultation: Whilst the chief exercised strict \ncontrol over peoples\u2019 personal and political lives, he was a model of \nconsultative democracy in relation to economic and social development. He \nfrequently said that the reason for the poor development of Stoneyridge \nrelated to lack of initiative by his subjects. \n \nOur Chief likes development, he wants to know peoples\u2019 views on how to achieve it. He says \nhe finds it difficult to lead a community where people don\u2019t say what they want. (Headman) \n \nWhilst he expressed strong commitment to the rhetoric of democracy, the \nempowerment of youth and women and social development through \ndelegation of power to headmen and local development committee\u2019s, his style \nof delegation ensured that none of these groups became a significant force in \nthe community. \n \nIn reality, the headmen have no real power. In reality its only the Chief who can take any \ninitiative. (Adult men) \n \n 10 \nMany community members revered the Chief and scapegoated the Headmen \nfor lack of progress. \n \nIf you have a good idea for community involvement, you can\u2019t go directly to the Chief. He will \ntell you to approach him through the correct channels \u2013 the headmen. However the Headmen \nhave destructive attitudes. If they think your idea is not a good one, they don\u2019t pass it on. And \nlacking knowledge, they feel threatened by peoples\u2019 demands. (Volunteers) \n \nInterviews with headmen themselves supported the claim that they lacked \nskills and confidence.  \n \nMost of us are illiterate. If we were more educated, the community would have a lot more \ndevelopment. (Headman) \n \n(Where is the drought relief people applied for?) We don\u2019t know. We are just blank, nobody \nexplains anything. We just distribute the forms people must fill in. (Perhaps the Chief has \ninformation about this?) Nobody has asked him. We are just signing something we don\u2019t know \nanything about. (Headman) \n \nAnother way the Chief \u2018shares\u2019 power with people is through delegating \nresponsibility for the development of electricity, irrigation plans and so on to \ncommittees of local people. Yet these committees had unskilled and poorly \nnetworked members. Furthermore people repeated said that those ideas that \nwere generated by the committees didn\u2019t ever see the light of day. Ideas were \ntaken to the Headmen to relay to the Chief, but never heard of again. \n \nExclusion of youth: The Chief frequently spoke of the importance of youth \ninvolvement in community projects. \n \nI ensure that the youth play a big role in this community. (Chief) \n \nHowever, here again there was a strong gap between rhetoric and reality. \n \nYouth are included by name, not in practice. They don\u2019t let youth get involved in real issues \nthat would empower them with skills and knowledge. I am one of the five youth reps on the \n 11 \nagriculture project. But they haven\u2019t given us any opportunities. One of the adults has done all \nthe work we should have been included in. (Young man) \n \nYouth attendance at meetings did not automatically mean they would be \nallowed to speak. \n \nThey hold community meetings at the Tribal Court to discuss important matters. When we as \nyouth raise our hands to say something, the chairperson says: \u2018Put your hands down, you are \nspoiling the meeting.\u2019 (Young man) \n \nTradition was repeatedly cited as the justification for adult control. \n \nThis is a good place to live because of respect and traditional customs \u2013 youth are under the \ncontrol of adults. (Headman) \n \nYoung people repeatedly said any criticism of the status quo was suppressed \nnot only by traditional norms, but also by parental fear that rebellious children \nwould lead to the Chief evicting the family from the community. \n \nWe depend on our parents for survival. If you talk the truth, perhaps express frustration at the \nlocal leadership, your parents will throw you out. We are forced to keep quiet because we \nneed a place to sleep, we have nowhere else to go. (Unemployed young man) \n \nA teacher commented that there was no space to challenge the status quo: \n \nA person who challenged the strict adherence to traditional culture would be like a drop in the \nocean. Those who live here accept this way of life. Those who do not, leave. (Teacher) \n \nAs a result, youth who are able to leave the community for the relative \nfreedom of the urban areas \u2013 those with education and job skills \u2013 tend to do \nso. With youth unemployment at 53%, many lack such options. Many young \npeople said this situation served to paralyse any independent activity on their \npart. \n \n 12 \nPeople are not free to do things. At one time we considered going to the municipality offices \nfor help to get a soccer field. But we feared the Chief would think we were undermining him \nrather than appreciating the initiative we were taking. (Young man) \n \nThe only youth involvement that was encouraged in the HIV\/AIDS arena was \ntradition-linked. Thus for example in the only ward where the Headman \nallowed youth to hold AIDS-related meetings related to plans to revive the \nReed Dances, traditional ceremonies celebrating young girls\u2019 virginity. \n \nThe exclusion of women: The Chief had a strongly expressed commitment \nto the formal education of girls. Despite this, various factors served to exclude \nyoung women from public life. Young girls were expected to prioritise \nhousehold chores over education, and their participation in community life \nwas very restricted. Such attitudes often inhibited their development of \neconomic independence, and limited their freedom to resist sexual advances \nby older men. \n \nThe Headman force us to love them. We can\u2019t even complain to our parents. If a man has \nmany cattle, they say we must accept his proposal (of sex). Our fathers are the worst here. If \nour mothers support us in disagreeing with what the Headmen are doing, they threaten to \nchase us out with our mothers. (Schoolgirl) \n \nIn interviews, the Chief repeatedly spoke of the pivotal role of women in \ncommunity survival. \n \nMost projects in this area are initiated by women. As long as there is a woman in the house \nthe family survives and the children thrive. When a woman leaves or ideas, the family suffers. \n(Chief) \n \nHe was also vocal about the importance of female leaders. However he \ndefined their roles very narrowly in terms of women-specific issues, such as \norganising Reed Dances, training girls to \u2018behave themselves\u2019 and helping \nmale leaders adjudicate in disputes that involved women. Restrictions on \nwomen were keenly felt by the Project\u2019s women volunteers, who repeatedly \nspoke of their work being undermined by their gender at every turn. \n 13 \n \nIn short, it appeared that day to day survival Stoneyridge depended on the \nefforts of women. Yet the power of these very women was constrained by \n\u2018cultural\u2019 and biological interpretations of their rights and roles, which defined \nany power that they might have as subordinate to men. \n \nA woman is something you pay cattle (bride-wealth) for. Thereafter you can treat her anyhow. \n(Adult woman) \n \nIf a woman goes against a man\u2019s rule, she must be punished. (Adult man) \n \nAs female leaders we have problems when we menstruate. I may have something urgent to \nsay, but can\u2019t stand in front of a man in that condition. I have to ask someone to stand in for \nme. (Female Headman) \n \nConclusion \n \nIn the face of widespread acceptance of community participation and \nempowerment as key pillars of HIV\/AIDS management, both internationally \nand in South Africa, this paper has sought to advance our understandings of \nthe wider social contexts that enable or hinder efforts to implement \n\u2018empowerment via participation\u2019 approaches. It has done so through a case \nstudy of the impact of local leadership styles on efforts to develop \u2018AIDS \ncompetence\u2019 in a South African rural community. \n \nOur case study found that despite his strong principled support for the \nprogramme, factors such as the Chief\u2019s \u2018traditional\u2019 attitudes to women and \nyouth, his celebration of polygamy, and his authoritarian governance style \nundermined the project\u2019s \u2018empowerment via participation\u2019 agenda \u2013 especially \nthe programme\u2019s attempts to reduce AIDS stigma, to build female and youth \ncapacity to control their sexual health, and to encourage men to take \nresponsibility for their role in tackling AIDS. \n \nEpidemics spread because existing social understandings and practices, and \nexisting public health systems, are inadequate for stemming the processes \n 14 \nthrough which they spread. One important aspect of challenging them \nrequires innovation and change to frameworks of understanding, action and \nintervention in affected communities. Traditional leaders need to be involved \nin AIDS management in rural areas. Yet the goals of AIDS projects may \ncontradict constructions of \u2018traditional\u2019 values from which they derive their \npower in ways that limit the types of \u2018thinking outside the box\u2019 that \ncharacterise AIDS competence.  \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nAndrew Gibbs assisted with literature review and data analysis. \n 15 \nReferences \n \nBeall, J (2006) Cultural weapons: traditions, inventions and the transition to \ndemocratic governance in metropolitan Durban.
