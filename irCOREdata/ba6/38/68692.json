Introduction\n[2] At high latitudes, magnetosphere\u2010ionosphere coupling\nis achieved through large\u2010scale field\u2010aligned current (FAC)\nsystems [e.g., Iijima and Potemra, 1976; Kosch and\nNielsen, 2001; Zmuda and Armstrong, 1974]. In the pre-\nmagnetic midnight dusk sector, downward FACs flow\nequatorward of the upward return currents and vice versa\nin the postmagnetic midnight dawn sector. The large\u2010scale\nmorphology of the FACs is controlled by the Bz and By com-\nponents of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) [Weimer,\n2001]. For Bz negative, the statistical strength of the FAC is\ncontrolled by the amplitude of Bz [Kosch and Nielsen,\n2001]. For Bz positive, the FAC strength weakens and\nbreaks up into multiple zones [Friis\u2010Christensen et al.,\n1985; Iijima and Shibaji, 1987]. These currents close via\npoleward (equatorward) ionospheric Pedersen currents in\nthe dusk (dawn) sector and dissipate energy via Joule heat-\ning, expressed by\nQJH \u00bc E2\u0002P; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere E is the electric field magnitude and SP is the\nheight\u2010integrated Pedersen conductance [Kosch and Nielsen,\n1995]. Joule heating is largely an E region phenomenon in\nthe ionosphere [Brekke and Rino, 1978].\n[3] The Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere between 100 and 300 km\naltitude consists mostly of neutral oxygen atoms and nitro-\ngen molecules, of which <1% is ionized. The large\u2010scale\npattern of high\u2010latitude ionospheric circulation is primarily\ndriven by the solar wind through magnetic reconnection of\nthe IMF with the Earth\u2019s geomagnetic field [e.g., Chisham\net al., 2007]. This large\u2010scale circulation results in antisun-\nward flow over the polar cap and westward (eastward)\nplasma flow in the high\u2010latitude dusk (dawn) ionosphere.\nThe plasma velocity is given by\nv \u00bc E\u0002 B\nB2\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere E is the ionospheric electric field imposed by the\nmagnetosphere and B is the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.

The shape and size of the large\u2010scale plas-\nma convection cells depend largely on the value of the\nIMF Bz and By components. For Bz negative, a single cir-\nculation cell exists in each of the dawn and dusk sectors,\nand the plasma flow speed is largely a function of the\nmagnitude of Bz. The relative size and shape of the cells\nis regulated by By. For By negative, the dawn cell is larger\nand vice versa. If Bz is significantly positive, then more\nthan two circulation cells can develop, consisting of weak\nplasma flow [Friis\u2010Christensen et al., 1985; Chisham et\nal., 2007].\n[4] It is well established that high\u2010latitude thermospheric\nneutral circulation is driven by ion drag, solar\u2010heating pres-\nsure, advection (momentum), and viscous and Coriolis\nforces. Ion drag through ion\u2010neutral collisions and pressure\ngradients due to solar heating are normally the dominant\ndriving forces in the F layer [e.g., Killeen and Roble,\n1984], but advection, solar heating, and Coriolis forces\nmay all exceed the ion drag force, depending on the plasma\ndensity height profile [Crickmore, 1995]. Just as large\u2010scale\nplasma convection is strongly influenced by Bz and By polar-\nity, so too is the upper thermospheric large\u2010scale neutral cir-\nculation [e.g., Thayer et al., 1987]. Solar heating and\nCoriolis are normally the dominant driving forces in the E\nlayer, although ion drag and advection may be important,\ndepending again on the plasma density [e.g., Killeen and\nRoble, 1984, 1986]. At high latitudes, auroral precipitation\nfrequently enhances the E region plasma density by an order\nof magnitude or more. E region winds maximize around\n100\u2013110 km altitude, with maximum speeds exceeding\n100 m\/s, and may experience a large shear with a vertical\nscale of 10 km or less [Larsen, 2002]. Following Nozawa\nand Brekke [1995], and ignoring all forces except ion drag,\nthe neutral wind acceleration is given by\n@u\n@t\n\u00bc \u0003\u0002in u\u0003 v\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere u and v are the neutral and plasma flow vectors,\nrespectively, and nin is the ion\u2010neutral collision frequency.\nFrom this simplified equation, it is obvious that ion drag is\nessentially a function of the ion\u2010neutral collision frequency,\nwhich is primarily a function of neutral density in the ther-\nmosphere [Schunk and Walker, 1973]. Thermospheric F\nlayer circulation broadly follows plasma convection with\nan e\u2010folding time of 0.5\u20133.5 h [Heelis et al., 2002; Killeen\nand Roble, 1984, 1988; Kosch et al., 2001a], depending on\ngeomagnetic activity. The e\u2010folding time is given by\n\u0003in \u00bc nnni\n1\n\u0002in\ns; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere nn and ni are the neutral and ion density, respectively.\nThe ion drag e\u2010folding time has not been measured in the\nE layer. However, since the ion\u2010neutral collision frequency\nis linear with neutral density, the change in e\u2010folding time\nessentially becomes a function of plasma density with alti-\ntude [Schunk and Walker, 1973]. Therefore, the e\u2010folding\ntime in the E layer may be more than an order of magni-\ntude greater compared with the F layer but will be highly\nvariable at high latitudes, decreasing during auroral precip-\nitation. The strength of the FAC, ionospheric Joule heat-\ning, plasma convection, and neutral winds are all\nincreased during geomagnetic activity and auroral sub-\nstorms but never disappear completely even during quiet\nperiods [e.g., Aruliah et al., 1991; Kosch and Nielsen,\n1995, 2001; McCormac et al., 1987; Senior et al., 1990].\n[5] The spatial scales of the ionospheric auroral plasma\ncan vary from the whole auroral oval down to the Debye\nlength limit [Galperin, 2001]. In particular, auroral arcs\nmay be hundreds to even thousands of kilometers geomag-\nnetic east\u2010west aligned, but the average optical width of\nsteady state auroral arcs is only 18 \u00b1 9 km [Knudsen et\nal., 2001]. Auroral precipitation is associated with FACs\nand local changes in ionospheric conductivity [e.g., Kosch\net al., 2001b]. The FACs close through the ionosphere, dis-\nsipating energy in the form of Joule heating (see equation\n(1)), which is a function of the local electric field and Ped-\nersen conductance [e.g.,Kosch and Nielsen, 1995].Codrescu\net al. [2000] have shown that small\u2010scale electric field\nvariability leads to the situation in which the average and\nvariable components have equal contributions to the total\nionospheric Joule heating. In addition, using a single azi-\nmuth scanning Fabry\u2010Perot interferometer (FPI) with tri-\nstatic radar plasma flow observations, Cierpka et al.\n[2000] showed that ignoring the neutral wind when estimat-\ning the ionospheric electric field resulted in an error of up to\n60% in the Joule\u2010heating calculation, at least in the F layer.\nUsing tristatic observations of the F layer plasma and neutral\nflow vectors at a single point, Aruliah et al. [2004] found\nthat the neutral wind dynamo was on average 50% of the\nmagnetospheric electric field and contributes an average\n41% of in situ Joule heating. A similar study has not been\ndone in the E layer, although Brekke and Rino [1978] found\nthat the maximum in ionospheric Joule heating occurred\naround 110\u2013130 km altitude. Hence, it is clear that meso-\nscale observations of the ionospheric electric field and Ped-\nersen conductance as well as the thermospheric neutral\nwinds in the E layer are important. In the past, such spatial\nresolution has not normally been available, especially for the\nneutral winds, over a wide field of view.\n[6] Despite the conventional wisdom that the neutral ther-\nmosphere forms a quasi steady state background to the ion-\nosphere, there is increasing evidence that mesoscale\nvariability in the thermospheric winds is a common feature.\nFor example, E region vertical winds of several tens of m\/s\nover periods of a few tens of minutes and F region vertical\nwinds exceeding 100 m\/s for periods of several hours [e.g.,\nPrice and Jacka, 1991; Price et al., 1995; Rees et al., 1984a,\n1984b] may result from ionospheric Joule heating during\nauroral activity. Price et al. [1995] estimated the horizontal\nextent of the vertical motion was <800 km and <320 km in\nthe F and E regions, respectively. However, Kosch et al.\n[2000b] found that both E and F region vertical winds, mea-\nsured 50 km apart in the auroral zone, were essentially\nuncorrelated. Using a chain of three azimuth scanning FPIs,\nAruliah and Griffin [2001] provided evidence of mesoscale\nthermospheric variability in the horizontal winds. Subse-\nquently, using tristatic observations of the F layer plasma\nand neutral flow vectors at a single point, Aruliah et al.\n[2005] found that the F layer thermosphere was significantly\nvariable on a time scale of minutes and a spatial scale of a\nKOSCH ET AL.: E REGION NEUTRAL WINDS AND AURORAL ARCS A02303A02303\n2 of 13\nfew hundred kilometers. Increasing the time resolution of\nthe observations from 15 to 1 min resulted in a 320%\nincrease in the estimated ionospheric Joule heating. Such\nwork has not been repeated in the E layer.\n[7] Auroral electrons precipitating into the atmosphere\ncarry an upward FAC [Arnoldy, 1974; Kamide and Akasofu,\n1976] and lose their energy by collisions at a rate of \u223c35 eV\nper ion\u2010electron pair formed [Rees and Luckey, 1974]. Upon\nrecombination, \u223c4% of the deposited energy results in opti-\ncal emissions associated with the aurora [Rees and Luckey,\n1974]. The most common visible emissions come from the\noxygen atoms, i.e., O(1D) giving 630 nm in the F layer\nand O(1S) giving 557.7 nm in the E layer. The change in\nthe E region plasma density is ne \/\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nI5577\np\n, where I5577 is\nthe 557.7 nm optical intensity, which is directly proportional\nto the precipitating particle flux [Kosch et al., 2001c].\nHence, the 557.7 nm optical intensity can be used as a proxy\nto estimate not only the degree of ion\u2010neutral coupling in the\nE layer (see equation (4)) but also the Pedersen conductance\n[Kosch et al., 1998], which linearly affects Joule heating (see\nequation (1)). The primary flux of electron energy into the au-\nroral atmosphere is 1\u201310 keV [Burch, 1991]. Optical triangu-\nlation has shown that the aurora normally occurs above 100\nkm altitude [Currie, 1955; St\u00f6rmer, 1955]. Del Pozo et al.\n[1997] found that the effective deposition altitude for precip-\nitating electrons in the E layer is related to their energy (E)\nby\nE H\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 4\u0002 105e\u00030:101H keV\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere H is the altitude in kilometers. Hence, a 557.7 nm\naurora at 120 km altitude corresponds to 2.2 keV electrons.\nThe 630 nm aurora corresponds to low\u2010energy electrons pre-\ncipitating into the F region, typically hundreds of eV. By\ntaking intensity ratios of different optical emissions, the en-\nergy of the precipitating particles can be estimated [e.g.,\nRees and Luckey, 1974; Kosch et al., 2001c], and therefore,\ntheir deposition altitude can be determined.\n[8] The upward FAC carried by the precipitating energetic\nelectrons within auroral arcs [Arnoldy, 1974; Kamide and\nAkasofu, 1976] must return via an equivalent downward\nFAC in order to satisfy current continuity, connecting in\nthe ionosphere via Pedersen currents [Tsunoda et al.,\n1976]. The closing downward current normally appears\nequatorward (poleward) of the auroral arc in the dusk\n(dawn) sector, consistent with the large\u2010scale ionospheric\nelectric field associated with ionospheric convection [Aikio\net al., 1993; Armstrong et al., 1975; Lewis et al., 1994],\nalthough this is not always the case [Opgenoorth et al.,\n1990]. Normally, the local arc\u2010induced ionospheric electric\nfield enhances the large\u2010scale convection electric field.\nHowever, the downward current is carried by cold iono-\nspheric electrons propagating upward [Arnoldy, 1974],\nwhich leaves a region typically <100 km wide adjacent to\nthe auroral arc, where a plasma depletion of 20%\u201370%\n(average 45%) may occur within a minute, though it typically\ntakes 5 min to develop [Doe et al., 1993, 1995]. This\nresults in a similar decrease in the Pedersen conductivity,\nwhich is linearly related to the plasma density [Brekke and\nRino, 1978; Egeland et al., 1973, p. 184]. Hence, in order\nto satisfy current continuity, intense horizontal ionospheric\nelectric fields, possibly exceeding 100 mV\/m, pointing into\nthe auroral arc can develop in a narrow region, possibly\n<45 km wide, on the equatorward (poleward) side of auroral\narcs in the dusk (dawn) sector [Aikio et al., 1993; Lewis et\nal., 1994; Opgenoorth et al., 1990].\n[9] Since the plasma velocity is given by equation (2) and\nthe ion drag component of the neutral velocity is given by\nequation (3), it is reasonable to expect that the neutral winds\nshould be influenced by the ionospheric electric field asso-\nciated with auroral arcs. Using a scanning Doppler imager\n(SDI, similar to that used in the study described in\nsection 2) to distinguish between spatial and temporal\nvariations in the F region neutral wind field, Conde et al.\n[2001] found that a latitudinal wind shear was related to\nan auroral arc in the dusk sector, which they attributed to\nion drag. Such an investigation has not been carried out in\nthe E layer.\n[10] In this study, we investigate the high\u2010latitude E\nregion neutral wind field\u2019s interaction with auroral arcs at\nmesoscale spatial resolution during geomagnetically quiet\nconditions. Two case studies, one each for westward and\neastward plasma convection, are presented. The most likely\ndriving mechanism is identified, and the E region e\u2010folding\ntime is very approximately estimated.\n2. Instrumentation and Modeling\n[11] Thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures can\nbe derived from passive Doppler measurements of the natu-\nrally occurring 630 and 557.7 nm optical emissions in the F\nand E layers, respectively, using ground\u2010based FPIs [e.g.,\nHernandez, 1986]. Traditionally, the neutral wind vectors\nhave been derived by scanning the sky at different azimuths\nat a fixed zenith angle for an assumed altitude, typically\nclose to \u223c240 and \u223c120 km for 630 and 557.7 nm, respec-\ntively [Kosch et al., 2000a]. This technique is greatly\nenhanced by the recent development of SDIs, which can\nderive line\u2010of\u2010sight wind measurements from many tens\nof software\u2010defined directions simultaneously in a wide\nfield of view [Conde and Smith, 1997, 1998]. The informa-\ntion from all line\u2010of\u2010sight Doppler measurements is used to\nderive an equivalent horizontal wind vector field, assuming\nthat the vertical winds are small [see Anderson et al., 2009,\nand references therein]. The assumption of small vertical\nthermospheric winds, especially in the E region, is generally\nvalid for quiet geomagnetic conditions [e.g., Kosch et al.,\n2000b]. In addition, a practical difficulty is that the SDI\ncan only directly measure vertical winds overhead unambig-\nuously, and vertical atmospheric motions are generally not\nsimilar within the instrument\u2019s field of view [e.g., Price et\nal., 1995; Kosch et al., 2000b]. Despite this limitation, the\nSDI is powerful for two reasons: (1) it can differentiate\nbetween spatial and temporal ambiguities in the thermo-\nspheric neutral wind field and (2) it observes with mesoscale\nresolution in all directions simultaneously. The typical time\nresolution of this optical technique is 1\u201320 min, depending\non the emission intensity. The typical spatial resolution is up\nto 50 and 100 km in the E and F layers, respectively.\n[12] For this study, we employed the Mawson SDI, located\nin Antarctica [Anderson et al., 2009], to obtain E and F\nregion neutral winds with mesoscale resolution. Mawson\nis located at 67.6\u00b0S and 62.9\u00b0E geographic and 70.4\u00b0S\nand 90.5\u00b0E geomagnetic, and magnetic local time =\nKOSCH ET AL.: E REGION NEUTRAL WINDS AND AURORAL ARCS A02303A02303\n3 of 13\nUT + 1.3. The SDI scanned the etalon gap through one\nfree spectral range in 128 steps in \u223c50 s. The number of\nscans integrated is variable depending on the emission\nintensity, but the software was limited to 1.7\u201320 min, with\nan average data cadence of 4 min. The SDI alternated\nbetween observations of the 557.7 and 630 nm emissions\noriginating in the E and F regions, respectively, with the\naltitude of the former obtained by modeling (discussed in\nsection 3) and that of the latter assumed to be 240 km.\nThe SDI observed 61 unique directions simultaneously in\na 144\u00b0 field of view. The observations were integrated\nover contiguous azimuthal zones, using zenith angles cen-\ntered on 0\u00b0 (1 zone), 23.8\u00b0 (4 zones), 40.0\u00b0 (8 zones),\n51.8\u00b0 (12 zones), 60.5\u00b0 (16 zones), and 67.0\u00b0 (20 zones).\nThese angles give an approximate radial spacing of 53,\n100, 152, 212, and 283 km at 120 km altitude in the E\nregion and 105, 200, 305, 425, and 565 km at 240 km\naltitude in the F region.\n[13] An all\u2010sky auroral imager was not available at\nMawson. Hence, the SDI Doppler fringes were used to pro-\nduce low\u2010resolution intensity images of the aurora by merg-\ning the raw fringe data. Strictly speaking, the pixels of the\nresulting images are not all precisely at the same wavelength\nbecause of spatial variation of the Doppler shift across the\nfield of view, but the change in wavelength is very small,\nand acceptable images are produced for 557.7 and\n630 nm. These images were not calibrated in intensity.\n[14] The ionospheric plasma density can be obtained from\na frequency\u2010sweeping ionosonde on the basis of the reflec-\ntion of the HF wave being equal to the plasma frequency as\nfollows:\nfpe Hz\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 9\u0002 103\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nne cm\u00033\u00f0 \u00de\np\n; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere ne is the electron density. The Mawson ionosonde\nwas used to estimate the maximum auroral E region electron\ndensity. The sounder was swept from 1 to 20 MHz every\n5 min. Backscatter direction\u2010of\u2010arrival information was not\navailable, so it was not possible to conclusively determine\nwhere the echoes were coming from, which was a limitation\nduring an auroral event.\n[15] High\u2010latitude F region plasma convection can be de-\nrived from the Doppler shift of decameter\u2010scale field\u2010\naligned plasma irregularities as observed by the crossed\nbeam HF radar SuperDARN network [Greenwald et al.,\n1995; Chisham et al., 2007]. The system currently consists\nof 13 Northern Hemisphere and 6 Southern Hemisphere\nradars, mostly at high latitudes, and normally has a spatial\nand temporal resolution of \u223c50 km and 2 min, respectively.\nThe map potential technique of combining line\u2010of\u2010sight ob-\nservations [Chisham et al., 2007; Ruohoniemi and Baker,\n1998] produces plasma velocity vectors where radar data\nare available as well as large\u2010scale plasma convection equi-\npotential contours. Data from the SuperDARN Southern\nHemisphere network of radars were used to generate these\noutputs with 2 min temporal resolution. This information\nwas used to put the neutral wind case studies into context\nof the plasma convection. Much of the radar backscatter data\ncome from the Syowa East radar, which overlooks Mawson,\nso the map potential technique was well constrained near the\nSDI\u2019s field of view.\n[16] In this study, the coupled thermosphere ionosphere\nplasmasphere (CTIP) model [Fuller\u2010Rowell and Rees,\n1980; Millward et al., 1996] was used to estimate the alti-\ntude of the SDI\u2019s 557.7 nm observations and to estimate\nthe rotational shear of the neutral wind with altitude in the\nE region. The altitude estimate was done by comparing\nthe SDI\u2019s 557.7 nm Doppler temperature measurement with\nthe model prediction. CTIP simulates the time\u2010dependent\nglobal structure of the wind vector, temperature, and density\nof the neutral thermosphere by numerically solving the non-\nlinear equations of momentum, energy, and continuity on a\nthree\u2010dimensional spherical polar grid rotating with the\nEarth. The equation of motion includes Coriolis effects,\nhorizontal pressure gradients, horizontal and vertical viscos-\nities, and ion drag. The energy equation describes horizontal\nand vertical advection of energy, horizontal and vertical\nheat conduction by both molecular and turbulent diffusion,\nheating by solar UV and EUV radiation, cooling by infra-\nred radiation, and ionospheric Joule heating. The continuity\nequation incorporates three major species, namely, atomic\noxygen, molecular nitrogen, and molecular oxygen, and\nincludes chemistry, transport, and the mutual diffusion\nbetween species. The model latitude, longitude, and time\nresolutions are 2\u00b0, 18\u00b0, and 72 min, respectively, and the\naltitude range spans \u223c80\u20131000 km in 15 logarithmically\nspaced pressure levels. Of course, the CTIPmodel has neither\nthe spatial nor the temporal resolution to directly model\nmesoscale auroral features. We use it only to estimate\nthe rotational shear of the steady state neutral wind as a func-\ntion of altitude, where the model has good spatial resolution.\n3. Results and Discussion\n[17] We present two case studies of high\u2010latitude E region\nthermospheric winds and their interaction with auroral arcs\nwith mesoscale resolution from Mawson, Antarctica. The\nselected events took place on 6 June 2008 (day 158, hereafter\nlabeled D158) and 10 June 2008 (day 162, hereafter labeled\nD162). On D158, Kp = 1 and 2 during the study interval\nand did not exceed 2+ for the previous 4 days; that is, quiet\ngeomagnetic conditions prevailed. On D162, Kp = 0\n+ during\nthe study interval and did not exceed 1+ for the previous 2\ndays; that is, very quiet geomagnetic conditions prevailed.\nFigures 1a\u20131j and 1k\u20131t show an overview of the case\nstudies, covering 1600\u20131900 and 1800\u20132100 UT on\nD158 and D162, respectively. Figures 1a and 1k show\nthe IMF data from the ACE satellite with Bz (solid line),\nBy (dashed line), and Bx (dotted line) in GSM coordinates.\nThe data have been time lagged by 63 and 73 min on D158\nand D162, respectively, to account for the solar wind prop-\nagation delay from the ACE satellite. On D158 Bz oscillated\naround zero with small amplitude, while By was mostly\nnegative and Bx was positive. On D162, Bz and Bx were\npositive throughout, and By was mostly negative.\n[18] Figures 2a and 2b show the Mawson SDI optical data\nand Southern Hemisphere SuperDARN radar data, for D158\nand D162, respectively. Figures 2a and 2b each consist of\ntime\u2010labeled plots arranged in two groups of three rows.\nFor each group, the top row shows the uncalibrated F layer\n630 nm Doppler images of intensity across the sky over\nMawson, with thermospheric wind vectors (yellow) overlaid\nfor each of the 61 zones; the middle row is in the same\nKOSCH ET AL.: E REGION NEUTRAL WINDS AND AURORAL ARCS A02303A02303\n4 of 13\nFigure 1.

The SuperDARN data are synchronized as best as\npossible with the SDI 557.7 nm plots. The average SDI data\ncadence was 3.5 and 4.0 min per wavelength on D158 and\nD162, respectively. The optical plots are orientated in geo-\ngraphic coordinates with north and east to the top and right,\nrespectively. Geomagnetic coordinates are obtained by rotat-\ning the axes 44\u00b0 counterclockwise; that is, geomagnetic\nnorth is equivalent to geographic northwest. The optical\nintensity scale is nonlinear (square root) to accommodate\nthe large intensity range. For the optical data, the vector in\nthe SDI zenith zone shows the average wind field from all\nFigure 2\nKOSCH ET AL.: E REGION NEUTRAL WINDS AND AURORAL ARCS A02303A02303\n6 of 13\nmeasurements, not the vertical wind. This vector essentially\nrepresents what a standard FPI would produce from multiple\nsequential point measurements. The SDI\u2019s field of view in\nthe E region (green circle) is overlaid onto the SuperDARN\nplots with geographic north (blue dot) and east (red dot)\nlabeled. The SuperDARN convection plots are orientated\nin geomagnetic coordinates, so that the Sun is to the top\nand the dusk (dawn) plasma convection cell is to the right\n(left). On average, only every third plasma flow vector is\nshown for clarity. Note that the plasma velocity scale is\nnot the same as that for the neutral wind vectors. The verti-\ncal winds over Mawson (not shown) oscillated around zero\nand showed no particular correlation to the aurora. On D158\n(D162), the median 557.7 nm vertical wind speed was 27\n(12) m\/s, and for 630 nm, it was 25 (18) m\/s during the\nperiods of interest. Vertical wind speeds of this magnitude,\nFigure 2. (continued)\nKOSCH ET AL.: E REGION NEUTRAL WINDS AND AURORAL ARCS A02303A02303\n7 of 13\noscillating around zero, are common over Mawson, so we\nare confident that the horizontal wind fit to the SDI Doppler\ndata is good.\n[19] For D158 (Figure 2a), the upper and lower thermo-\nspheric winds flowed eastward and southeastward at the\nstart of this event, consistent with the work of Anderson et\nal. [2009]. As is clearly evident from the optical images,\nan auroral arc appeared at \u223c1721:42 UT in the southeast\n(geomagnetic poleward) and progressed toward the north-\nwest (geomagnetic equatorward). Notable in the 557.7 nm\ndata from 1727:52 to 1754:19 UT is that poleward of the\narc, the winds decreased in amplitude, whereas equatorward\nof the arc, the winds remained unaffected. The 630 nm\nwinds appear mostly unaffected by the arc\u2019s passage. How-\never, from 1754:19 UT onward the 557.7 nm winds north-\neast (geomagnetic east) of Mawson rotated essentially 90\u00b0\nto flow southwestward (geomagnetic west) parallel to the\narc within a region \u223c50 km wide on either side of the arc.\nThis was very clear at 1801:24 UT. However, this rotation\nwas localized and did not occur southwest of Mawson.\nThe 630 nm winds only started to respond to the aurora from\n1804:37 UT onward, when they also rotated to flow parallel\nto the arc. Again, the neutral flow is toward the southwest\n(geomagnetic west) but is localized to the northeast (geo-\nmagnetic east) of Mawson. Few SuperDARN data were\navailable on D158, but the majority came from the Syowa\nEast radar with backscatter to the geomagnetic west of\nMawson. Hence, the plasma flow equipotential contours\nare reliable near Mawson. The SuperDARN data clearly\nshow that Mawson was under the dusk plasma convection\ncell and experienced geomagnetic westward plasma flow\nin the F region throughout this event. The large\u2010scale\ntwo\u2010cell plasma convection circulation in the F layer is con-\nsistent with the observed Bz, and By negative enhanced the\nsize of the dawn convection cell. Importantly for this event,\nnot only were the lower thermospheric winds significantly\naffected by the passage of the arc, but both upper and lower\nthermospheric winds rotated to flow parallel to the arc in the\ndirection of the plasma flow.\n[20] For D162 (Figure 2b), the upper and lower thermo-\nspheric winds flowed primarily eastward (geomagnetic\nsoutheastward) at the start of this event, consistent with\nthe work of Anderson et al. [2009]. From 1903:17 to\n1955:57 UT, an auroral arc appeared over Mawson, reach-\ning its peak intensity between 1940:37 and 1949:05 UT. No-\ntable in the 557.7 nm data from 1909:57 to 1955:57 UT is\nthat the neutral wind in the E layer rotated 90\u00b0 to flow north-\neastward (geomagnetic eastward), i.e., parallel to the arc,\nwithin a region \u223c50 km wide on either side of the arc. This\nobservation is consistent with that of Wescott et al. [2006],\nwho also found the E region neutral wind to be parallel to an\nauroral arc from a rocket chemical release experiment. Else-\nwhere in the SDI\u2019s field of view, i.e., geomagnetic poleward\nand equatorward of the arc, the wind field remained un-\nchanged from the previous background flow. From\n2003:43 UT onward, the arc disappeared, and the E region\nwinds rotated back, so that the neutral flow was eastward\nand southeastward in the upper and lower thermosphere,\nrespectively, i.e., as if the auroral arc had never existed.\nThe slow rotation of the 557.7 nm background winds from\neastward to southeastward over 2 h is expected at this time\nand is consistent with the large\u2010scale plasma convection pat-\ntern. The 630 nm winds appear largely unaffected by the\narc\u2019s passage. However, from 1914:04 to 1952:20 UT there\nis some evidence that the F region winds also rotated to flow\nnortheastward parallel to the arc. However, this rotation was\nlocalized and only occurred overhead and southwest of\nMawson. Similar to the 557.7 nm winds, the 630 nm winds\nrotated back to flow eastward when the arc disappeared.\nThis event is different from D158 because it shows that\nthe winds rotate to flow in the direction opposite to what\nmight be expected in the dusk sector plasma flow, i.e., geo-\nmagnetically eastward instead of westward. However, the\nIMF Bz and By were positive and mostly negative, respec-\ntively, throughout this event (Figure 1k), thereby making\nlarge\u2010scale multicell plasma convection in the F layer possi-\nble with an enhanced dawn cell. Again, few SuperDARN\ndata were available on D162, the majority coming from\nthe Syowa East radar with backscatter mostly (sometimes)\nto the geomagnetic west (east) of Mawson. Hence, again,\nthe plasma flow equipotential contours are reliable near\nMawson. The SuperDARN data show that Mawson was in\nfact under (e.g., 1948 UT) or near (e.g., 1910 UT) the dawn\nplasma convection cell, which was greatly extended into the\ndusk sector and therefore experienced geomagnetic eastward\nplasma flow in the F region. Although the SuperDARN data\nshow that between 1910 and 1948 UT, Mawson was under\ngeomagnetic westward plasma flow, the continued north-\neastward wind parallel to the arc presumably comes about\nbecause of the high inertia of the neutral atmosphere in\nthe E region. Prior to and after this event, Mawson was\nunder geomagnetic westward plasma flow, as is normally\nexpected for the dusk sector. For this event, the upper\nthermospheric winds were largely unaffected by the pas-\nsage of the arc, but the lower thermospheric winds rotated\nto flow parallel to the arc in the direction of the plasma\nflow. While the geomagnetic eastward plasma flow direc-\ntion was unusual for the time of day (i.e., dusk sector),\nthe wind rotation on D162 was consistent with D158.\n[21] Figures 1b and 1l show the 630 (red dotted line) and\n557.7 nm (green dashed line) uncalibrated optical intensity\naveraged over a cone of \u00b132\u00b0 zenith angle from the SDI\nDoppler images. The passage of the 557.7 nm auroral arcs\nis clearly seen on both days, peaking at 14,200 and 7900\ncounts on D158 (Figure 1b) and D162 (Figure 1l), respec-\ntively. The 630 nm intensity is much lower and less variable\nthan the 557.7 nm emission, as expected, peaking at\n1300 and 650 counts on D158 and D162, respectively.\nFigures 1c and 1m show the estimated E region peak plasma\nfrequency (solid line) and height of the bottom of the peak\n(dashed line) extracted from ionograms. The auroral E layer\nblanketed the F region for most of the time. The wide field\nof view of the ionosonde and the complex nature of auroral\nprecipitation on D158 make the exact geographic location of\nthe plasma frequency data uncertain. However, the increase\nin peak E region frequency during each event, compared\nwith immediately before and after the event, is clear. On\nD158 and D162, the peak E region frequency went\nfrom 2.3 to 11.3 (corresponding to 6.5 \u00d7 104 and 1.6 \u00d7\n106 el\/cm3) and from 3.1 to 7.1 MHz (corresponding to 1.2 \u00d7\n105 and 6.2 \u00d7 105 el\/cm3), respectively. From equation (6),\nthis represents a 24.1X and 5.2X increase in plasma density\non D158 and D162, respectively. The altitude of the bottom\nof the auroral E layer on D158 occurred between 90 and\nKOSCH ET AL.: E REGION NEUTRAL WINDS AND AURORAL ARCS A02303A02303\n8 of 13\n133 km but was very variable. According to equation (5), this\ncorresponds to precipitating electrons of energy >0.5 keV.\nOff\u2010vertical ionosonde reflections from auroral E layers will\ngive an apparent height greater than the actual height.\nHence, when the height measurements are variable, the bot-\ntom of the E layer is likely to be closer to the lower mea-\nsured height, which also increases the electron energy\nestimate. On D162 the altitude varied more smoothly\nfrom 93 to 123 km, corresponding to electron energies\n>1.6 keV, reaching a minimum height when the auroral\narc was overhead. The decrease in altitude indicates a hard-\nening of the precipitating electron energy spectrum [del\nPozo et al., 1997].\n[22] Figures 1d and 1n show the F region (red dotted line)\nand E region (green dashed line) thermospheric neutral tem-\nperature averaged over a cone of \u00b132\u00b0 zenith angle from the\nSDI Doppler data. The upper thermospheric temperature\nvaried from 670 to 740 K and from 650 to 700 K on\nD158 and D162, respectively. These modest temperatures\nin the F region are consistent with solar minimum. The low-\ner thermospheric temperature varied from 430 to 580 K and\nfrom 400 to 530 K on D158 and D162, respectively. Note\nthat the 557.7 nm Doppler temperature dropped noticeably\nduring the passage of the bright auroras. This we associated\nwith a drop in the 557.7 nm emission altitude [e.g., Holmes\net al., 2005], and it is consistent with the ionosonde data.\nFigures 1e and 1o show the optical intensity ratio I5577\/\nI6300 (dotted line) from Figures 1b and 1l and the CTIP mod-\neled height of the 557.7 nm optical emission (green dashed\nline) inferred from the SDI temperature observations in\nFigures 1d and 1n. The ratio of optical intensities is a use-\nful indicator of the energy of precipitating electrons [e.g.,\nRees and Luckey, 1974], although our uncalibrated data\ndo not allow us to make a quantitative estimate. However,\nit is clear that during the passage of the auroral arcs, seen\nin Figures 1b and 1l, the intensity ratio increases, peaking\nat 23.0 and 16.4 on D158 and D162, respectively. An in-\ncreased intensity ratio indicates a hardening of the electron\nenergy spectrum, which would be associated with a de-\ncrease in the emission altitude [e.g., del Pozo et al.,\n1997]. This predicted behavior is clearly shown by the\nCTIP modeled height of the 557.7 nm emission, decreasing\nin altitude as the auroral arcs pass overhead of Mawson (see\nFigures 1e and 1o) and is consistent with the ionosonde data\n(Figures 1c and 1m). On D158 and D162, the modeled altitude\nof the 557.7 nm emission varies from 128 to 209 km and from\n130 to 164 km, respectively.\n[23] Figure 1 also shows the SDI E region neutral winds\naveraged over a cone of \u00b132\u00b0 zenith angle (Z558) (Figures 1f\nand 1p) and the entire field of view (A558) (Figures 1g\nand 1q). The vectors are shown in geographic coordinates.\nFor D158, there was little apparent difference between\nnarrow and wide fields of view, except at \u223c1730 and\n\u223c1800 UT, when the winds near the zenith acquired a small\nnorthward meridional component as the aurora appeared\n(Figure 1b). For D162, there was a clear difference between\nthe narrow and wide fields of view. The 557.7 nm winds\nnear the zenith became strongly northward between 1915 and\n2000 UT. These data clearly demonstrate the power of the\nall\u2010sky SDI versus traditional FPIs in separating spatial\nversus temporal ambiguities at mesoscale resolution. Also\nshown are the SDI F region neutral winds averaged over\na cone of \u00b132\u00b0 zenith angle (Figures 1h and 1r) and the\nentire field of view (Figures 1i and 1s). For D158, there\nwas little apparent difference between narrow and wide fields\nof view, except prior to \u223c1745 UT, the winds near the zenith\nhad a larger amplitude and a greater northward meridional\ncomponent. For D162, there was a clear difference between\nthe narrow and wide fields of view. The 630 nm winds near\nthe zenith had a northward meridional component for much\nof the time, whereas the average wind field always had a\nsouthward meridional component.\n[24] Figures 3a and 3b show the CTIP modeling outcome\nfor 1800 UT on D158 and 1912 UT on D162, respectively,\nthe model times closest to the appearance of the auroral arcs.\nFigure 3 shows the altitude profile for neutral temperature\n(green solid line) and meridional (dotted line) and zonal\n(dashed line) winds in geographic coordinates, where north\nand east are positive. This modeling exercise is necessary in\norder to determine whether the observed wind rotations,\nseen in Figure 2, associated with auroral arcs in the E region\ncould be due to wind shear in altitude. The temperature pro-\nfile is that which was used to estimate the 557.7 nm emis-\nsion altitude in Figures 1e and 1o. On D158, the estimated\naltitude varies from 128 to 209 km, giving a CTIP meridio-\nnal wind component from \u221226.6 to 20.2 m\/s northward and\na zonal component from \u2212100.7 to \u221280.0 m\/s eastward, re-\nspectively. At 128 and 209 km altitude, this corresponds to a\nwind of amplitude 104.2 and 82.5 m\/s and a direction of\n255.2\u00b0 and 284.2\u00b0 geographic, respectively, measured east\nof geographic north. CTIP predicts that the E region wind\nis predominantly westward, which is very different from\nwhat the SDI observed (see Figures 1f and 1g). However,\nAnderson et al. [2009] found a similar discrepancy between\nobservations and CTIP at Mawson. Likewise, Kosch et al.\n[2000a] also found systematic differences between observa-\ntions and the CTIP model in the northern high\u2010latitude\nhemisphere. More importantly, the change in altitude brings\na change in wind direction of \u223c29\u00b0, which is too small to ex-\nplain the SDI observations of \u223c90\u00b0 rotation. Following the\nsame procedure for D162, the estimated altitude varies from\n130 to 164 km, giving a CTIP meridional wind component\nfrom \u221228.3 to \u221257.8 m\/s northward and a zonal component\nfrom \u221293.4 to \u221295.9 m\/s eastward, respectively. At 130 and\n164 km altitude, this corresponds to a wind of amplitude\n97.6 and 112 m\/s and direction of 253.1\u00b0 and 238.9\u00b0 geo-\ngraphic, respectively. CTIP predicts that the E region wind\nis predominantly southwestward, which is again very differ-\nent from what the SDI observed (see Figures 1p and 1q).\nHowever, the change in altitude only brings a change in\nwind direction of \u223c14\u00b0, which is again far too small to\nexplain the SDI observations of \u223c90\u00b0 rotation. Hence,\nwe conclude that the wind rotation observed by the SDI\nin the vicinity of the auroral arcs is real and not an arti-\nfact of the 557.7 nm emission altitude changing.\n[25] Figures 1j and 1t show the average SuperDARN plas-\nma flow vectors (blue) in the F region for the entire SDI\nfield of view. The data are plotted at 4 min resolution for\nclarity. Note that the scale for the plasma vectors is half that\nfor the neutral wind vectors. The number and location of\nSuperDARN data were variable and generally not overhead\nof Mawson (see Figures 2a and 2b). On both days, Super-\nDARN almost never had data within a 200 km radius of\nMawson. The maximum number of plasma vectors at any\nKOSCH ET AL.: E REGION NEUTRAL WINDS AND AURORAL ARCS A02303A02303\n9 of 13\none time within the SDI\u2019s F region field of view was 14 dur-\ning both events with an average geomagnetic location of\n69.0\u00b0S, 81.5\u00b0W on D158 and 69.0\u00b0S, 80.4\u00b0W on D162.\nThis corresponds to an average distance of 380 and 419\nkm slightly north of geomagnetic west from Mawson on\nD158 and D162, respectively, i.e., near the edge of the\nSDI\u2019s F region field of view. These distances translate to\nMawson being 36.0 and 40.4 min ahead of the SuperDARN\ndata on D158 and D162, respectively. As a result of this spa-\ntial discrepancy only a general qualitative comparison of\nplasma and neutral wind vectors is possible. However, such\na comparison remains valid because the auroral arcs were\ngeomagnetically east\u2013west aligned. On both D158 and\nD162, the general background plasma flow is southwest\n(geomagnetic westward), as expected for the dusk sector.\nOn D158, the passage of the auroral arc at \u223c1730 and\n\u223c1800 UT corresponds to an increase in the plasma flow\nin the same direction as the background flow. This is entire-\nly consistent with the expected ionospheric electrodynamics\nof an auroral arc [e.g., Aikio et al., 1993; Lewis et al., 1994;\nOpgenoorth et al., 1990]. However, on D162, the appear-\nance of the auroral arc at \u223c1900 UT resulted in westward\nplasma flow, and at \u223c1945 UT, it resulted in northeastward\n(geomagnetic eastward) plasma flow, the latter being in the\ndirection opposite to the expected plasma flow in the dusk\nsector. However, as Figure 2b shows, Mawson was tempo-\nrarily under the dawn plasma convection cell around 1856 to\n1902 UT as well as 1948 and 1956 UT. The dawn convec-\ntion cell had extended itself into the dusk sector during this\nevent, consistent with persistent Bz positive. Although this\nscenario is somewhat unusual, the SDI observations remain\nconsistent with the expected ionospheric electrodynamics\nof an auroral arc, as described in section 1.\n[26] It seems clear that the two normally dominant driving\nforces for neutral winds in the E region, namely, solar heat-\ning and Coriolis force, are not responsible for the mesoscale\nchange in wind pattern associated with auroral arcs. First,\nthe solar heating pressure force would be fairly constant\nthroughout the studied events. Second, if Joule heating asso-\nciated with the auroral arc caused the gas to expand perpen-\ndicularly away from the arc, the Coriolis force would act in\nopposite directions on either side of the arc, which is not the\ncase. The observations show the wind blowing parallel to\nthe arc in the same direction on both sides of the arc. The\nCTIP model shows that the change in emission altitude is\nnot sufficient to explain the observed rotation of neutral\nwind vectors. The most likely candidate force to explain\nthe observations appears to be ion drag, which is in the correct\ndirection for both events. Since the plasma density increases\nby 24.1X on D158 and 5.2X on D162, equation (4) shows\nthat the ion\u2010neutral coupling time decreases by the same\namount. It is shown on D158 that the vector rotation occurred\nwithin one time step, i.e., 7 min, consistent with the large\nincrease in E region plasma density of 24.1X. Furthermore,\nD162 shows that the vector rotation occurred within two time\nFigure 3. (a) CTIP model altitude profile for neutral\ntemperature (green solid line), meridional (dotted line),\nand zonal (dashed line) winds at 1800 UT on 6 June 2008\n(D158). (b) The format is identical to that of Figure 3a,\nexcept it is for 10 June 2008 (D162).\nKOSCH ET AL.: E REGION NEUTRAL WINDS AND AURORAL ARCS A02303A02303\n10 of 13\nsteps, i.e., 16 min, consistent with the smaller plasma density\nenhancement of 5.2X. Hence, we conclude that the ion drag\ne\u2010folding time in the E region can be very short, of the order\nof 10 min or less, depending on the plasma density. Unfortu-\nnately, the lack of plasma flow data in the E region and the\nlow SDI data cadence do not permit a proper quantitative\nassessment of the E region e\u2010folding time for these data.\n[27] For an auroral arc in the dusk (dawn) sector, the pole-\nward (equatorward) pointing ionospheric electric field on\nthe equatorward (poleward) side of the auroral arc, associat-\ned with the closure of the FAC within and near the arc, pro-\nvides the driving E \u00d7 B force for the ions, which then\naccelerate the neutral gas in the observed directions via col-\nlisions. Unfortunately, the temporal resolution of the 557.7\nnm SDI data is too low to resolve on which side of the\narc the winds rotated because the arcs are moving in the geo-\nmagnetic meridional direction. However, our observations\nstrongly suggest that the increased ion drag must be suffi-\ncient to overcome the other existing forces acting on the\nneutral particles. Without a suitable radar, such as the Euro-\npean Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) facility, we have no\nmeans of estimating mesoscale plasma flow in the E region\nand therefore no means of direct verification at this time.\n[28] The time interval 1910 to 1940 UT on D162 provides\nan interesting observation. For \u223c15 min prior to 1910 UT\nand after 1940 UT, F region plasma flow near Mawson\nwas eastward geomagnetic close to, and presumably within,\nthe SDI field of view (see Figure 2b), which is consistent\nwith the argument given above for the neutral wind direction\nadjacent to the auroral arc. However, beginning at 1910 UT\nand continuing until 1940 UT, the dominant F region plas-\nma flow was in the geomagnetic westward direction; yet the\nneutral winds remained eastward adjacent to the arc. Earlier\nwe stated that this was due to the considerable inertia of the\nE region atmosphere, but the E region e\u2010folding time for\nD162 was then estimated to be <16 min, which is much\nshorter than the 30 min of opposite F region plasma and\nE region neutral flow. During this interval the auroral arc be-\ncame brighter, suggesting an increased FAC strength and\ntherefore also an increased arc\u2010induced ionospheric electric\nfield. The ionosonde data (Figure 1m) show the E region\nplasma density increasing, so ion\u2010neutral coupling was\nalso increasing. Therefore, one might expect the neutral\nwinds parallel to the arc to reverse direction at \u223c1910 and\n\u223c1940 UT, but this is not what the SDI observations show.\nHence, it may be true that once the region of downward\nFAC associated with the arc is established according to the\nlarge\u2010scale plasma flow [Aikio et al., 1993; Armstrong et\nal., 1975; Lewis et al., 1994], in this case equatorward of\nthe arc, it cannot suddenly switch to the other side of the\narc because the plasma convection has reversed itself. This\nwould be consistent with the observation of Opgenoorth\net al. [1990] that the side of the arc where the closure\nFAC flows is not always consistent with the large\u2010scale iono-\nspheric convection electric field. To the authors\u2019 best knowl-\nedge, our observation may be unique. If true, this implies that\nthe local E region plasma flow associated with the arc is in the\ndirection opposite to the background F region plasma flow.\nUnfortunately, we are unable to verify the above speculation\nproperly for lack of spatially coincident SDI and SuperDARN\nobservations.\n[29] Finally, we find that there are no noticeable changes\nin the E or F region neutral temperature adjacent to the arc\nfor either D158 or D162. This is perhaps surprising given\nthat ion drag, i.e., ion\u2010neutral collisions, is assumed respon-\nsible for the wind rotation adjacent to the arc. However, the\nhardening of the precipitating electron spectrum caused the\n557.7 nm emission altitude to descend, which caused an ap-\nparent decrease in E region temperature. The Pedersen con-\nductivity peaks at 120 km in the lower E region [Schlegel,\n1988], and so Joule heating (see equation (1)) in the F re-\ngion is expected to be lower by approximately an order of\nmagnitude. However, although the Joule heat dissipation\nper unit volume is higher in the E region, the rate of heating\nper unit mass is greatest around 400 km [Deng and Ridley,\n2007], so the temperature change in the F region should be\ngreater. Since the SDI data show no significant thermo-\nspheric temperature change, we conclude that Joule heating\nwas very low, consistent with Kp < = 2 during these events\n[Kosch and Nielsen, 1995].\n[30] It is clear that the neutral wind in the high\u2010latitude E\nregion can be strongly influenced by auroral precipitation in\nthe form of arcs. This requires that the two following condi-\ntions be met: (1) the energy of the precipitating particles is\nhigh enough for a plasma density enhancement to occur in\nthe E layer [e.g., del Pozo et al., 1997] and (2) the flux is\nhigh enough to cause appreciable enhancement in the plas-\nma density [e.g., Kosch et al., 1998]. The particle energy\nand flux can be estimated from calibrated optical intensity\nratios [e.g., Rees and Luckey, 1974]. If both the energy\nand flux are high enough, then the E region plasma density\nis enhanced, as is frequently the case for auroral arcs. This\nthen linearly increases the ion\u2010neutral coupling or, in other\nwords, linearly reduces the coupling e\u2010folding time (see\nequation (4)). The flux of auroral particles is also a measure\nof the upward current flowing within the auroral arc, which\nhas to be matched by an equal downward current. This pair\nof FAC sheets must be closed in the ionosphere by a hori-\nzontal Pedersen current with its associated electric field.\nThis electric field produces a localized plasma flow via\nthe E \u00d7 B force, which then creates the necessary ion drag\nto force the neutral wind flow in another direction, i.e., par-\nallel to the arc. Wang et al. [2005] found that the nightside\nFAC behaved like a current source. Vickrey et al. [1986]\nshowed that the magnetosphere acts as a current generator\non a 3\u201380 km spatial scale. Hence, the ionospheric electric\nfield is a function of the E region Pedersen conductance,\nwhich is linearly dependent on the plasma density and can\nbe estimated from calibrated 557.7 nm optical data [Kosch\net al., 1998; Senior et al., 2008]. The plasma density adja-\ncent to the auroral arc is reduced because the downward\nreturn current is carried by cold ionospheric electrons, and\nso an intense electric field can develop adjacent to arcs on\none side, especially if they remain stationary long enough\n(several minutes) to create a plasma density depletion [Doe\net al., 1993, 1995]. However, it is the enhanced plasma den-\nsity of the arc that produces the enhanced ion\u2010neutral cou-\npling, seemingly opposite to the need to generate a strong\nionospheric electric field. Hence, a balance must exist in\nplasma density between the need to generate a strong iono-\nspheric electric field (i.e., low plasma density) and the need\nto generate strong ion\u2010neutral coupling (i.e., high plasma\ndensity). The high (low) ionospheric plasma density region\nKOSCH ET AL.: E REGION NEUTRAL WINDS AND AURORAL ARCS A02303A02303\n11 of 13\nwill be within (next to) the arc, spatially separated by a few\ntens of kilometers. Presumably, both conditions of a strong\nelectric field and high ion\u2010neutral coupling can be more eas-\nily met by having a strong particle flux, i.e., a bright aurora,\nand the arc slowly drifting perpendicular to its long axis.\nBoth conditions occur frequently for auroral arcs. The phe-\nnomenon described here would not necessarily apply to other\ntypes of aurora (e.g., pulsating patches) because it is not obvi-\nous that all the necessary conditions (e.g., enhanced iono-\nspheric electric field) would be satisfied.\n[31] This study can be improved in a quantitative sense in\nthe following three regards:\n[32] 1. The SDI data cadence in the E region was too\nslow, averaging 7\u20138 min, to observe the E region neutral\nwind response time in the vicinity of the auroral arc, limited\npartly by the scanning etalon speed, minimum integration\ntime imposed, and interleaved 630 nm observations. In-\ncreasing the data cadence may also reveal the wind rota-\ntion occurring only on one side of the arc, as expected.\n[33] 2. The SDI spatial resolution can be improved by\nadjusting the data zones to permit a resolution better than\n50 km.\n[34] 3. The availability of simultaneous electric field and\nplasma density data in the E region would permit quantita-\ntive calculation of the ion\u2010neutral e\u2010folding time as a func-\ntion of plasma density. It would also permit estimation of\nthe neutral wind\u2010corrected Joule heating [e.g., Kosch and\nNielsen, 1995] and FAC strength [e.g., Kosch et al.,\n2001b] in the vicinity of the auroral arc, both of which indi-\nrectly affect the ion drag. In the F layer, the neutral wind can\naffect the Joule heating by as much as 60% [Cierpka et al.,\n2000]. However, ionospheric Joule heating is primarily an E\nregion phenomenon, yet the effect of the neutral wind field\nhas to date not been properly quantified through observa-\ntions. The E region Hall [Senior et al., 2007] and Pedersen\n[Kosch et al., 1998] conductance data can be obtained from\ncalibrated riometer absorption and 557.7 nm optical data,\nrespectively. In addition, incoherent scatter radar data\n[Kirkwood and Osepian, 1995], or multiwavelength cali-\nbrated optical data [e.g., Rees and Luckey, 1974], will allow\nthe characteristic energy and flux of the precipitating parti-\ncles to be determined. This, in turn, will give altitude and\nFAC strength of the auroral arc [e.g., del Pozo et al.,\n1997], which then determines the degree of ion\u2010neutral cou-\npling in the E layer close to the arc. Steerable radar systems\nsuch as the EISCAT facility are capable of providing inter-\nleaved E and F region tristatic plasma velocity, density, and\ntemperature measurements with acceptable temporal reso-\nlution [e.g., Davies et al., 1997; Makarevich et al., 2006].\n4. Conclusion\n[35] We have shown, for the first time, that auroral precip-\nitation in the form of arcs can have a dramatic effect on the\nE region neutral wind field on a spatial mesoscale. Using an\nSDI, two effects are observed: (1) A magnetically equator-\nward moving arc caused the wind speed to rapidly diminish\npoleward of the arc. (2) An auroral arc caused the wind di-\nrection to rotate 90\u00b0 to flow parallel to the arc within 7\u201316\nmin in a region less than \u223c50 km from the arc. We show that\nthis effect is due neither to changing altitude of the emission\nnor to the normally dominant solar heating pressure and\nCoriolis forces in the E region but that increased plasma\ndensity and electric field in the immediate vicinity of the au-\nroral arc greatly enhances the localized ion drag forces, pos-\nsibly by more than an order of magnitude.\n[36] Acknowledgments.
