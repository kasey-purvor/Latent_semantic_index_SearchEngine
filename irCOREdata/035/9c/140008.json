Greywater has particular advantages in that it is a large\nsource with a low organic content. Through critical analysis of data from existing\ngreywater recycling applications this paper presents a review of existing technologies\nand applications; collating a disparate information base and comparing \/ contrasting\nthe strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. Findings suggest that simple\ntechnologies and sand filters have been shown to achieve only a limited treatment of\nthe greywater whereas membranes were reported to provide good removal of the\nsolids but could not efficiently tackle the organic fraction. Alternatively, biological\nand extensive schemes achieved good general treatment of greywater with a\nparticularly good removal of the organics. The best overall performances were\nobserved within the schemes combining different types of treatment to ensure\neffective treatment of all the fractions.\n3Introduction\nWastewater recycling has been and continues to be practiced all over the world for a\nvariety of reasons including; to increase water availability, combat water shortages\nand drought, and support environmental and public health protection.1 The increase\nin water demand is due mainly to the steady rise in the world\u2019s population which also\ngenerates an increase in wastewater production. Consequently wastewater, if recycled,\nbecomes a significant source of water that could potentially cover for the lack of fresh\nwater observed elsewhere. Worldwide, the most common application for wastewater\nrecycling is agricultural irrigation.2 However, other options such as industrial,\nrecreational, environmental and urban reuse have been practised.3 The potential\nsources identified for urban reuse are sewage4, greywater5 and rain water6, where\ngreywater is defined as domestic wastewater excluding toilet flush. In some cases,\nmixed rain and grey waters7 have been used as well as a \u2018light greywater\u2019 including\nonly the sources from the bathroom.8\nThe advantage of recycling greywater is that it is a large source with a low organic\ncontent. To illustrate, greywater represents up to 70% of total consumed water but\ncontains only 30% of the organic fraction and from 9 to 20% of the nutrients.9\nMoreover, in an individual household, it has been established that greywater could\nsupport the amount of water needed for toilet flushing and outdoor uses such as car\nwashing and garden watering.10 For example in the UK, on average, toilet flushing\nand outdoor use represent 41% of total domestic water usage whereas greywater from\nshower, bath, hand basin, laundry and dishwasher correspond to 44% (Table 1).\nHowever, at larger scale, other applications such as irrigation of parks, school yards,\n4cemeteries and golf courses, fire protection and air conditioning have been\nconsidered.12\nThat greywater recycling is both feasible and can contribute to sustainable water\nmanagement is now widely accepted. However, greywater only schemes are currently\nthe poor relations of water recycling activities on the global stage. This paper provides\na long overdue review of existing technologies and applications; collating a disparate\ninformation base and comparing \/ contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of\ndifferent treatment options. Our ambition in presenting the data in this way is to\nprovide a critical and context sensitive analysis of the performance attributes of\ntechnologies used for greywater treatment. The focus on treatment performance\nmeans that a formal comparison of just how sustainable each technology option is\ncannot be explicitly addressed. However, the ability to meet published quality criteria\nfor sub-potable water uses is a pre-condition for considering these technologies for\napplication and it is in this context that the information presented is of value. Of\nrelevance to both practitioners and researchers, the material also comprises a\ncontemporary account of greywater reuse applications.\nTreatment technologies for greywater recycling\nInvestigations into the treatment and recycling of greywater have been reported since\nthe 1970\u2019s.13-16 The first technologies studied were mainly physical treatment options\nsuch as coarse filtration or membranes often coupled with disinfection.14, 15 Later in\nthe 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, biological based technologies such as rotating biological\ncontactor17, biological aerated filters2, 18 and aerated bio-reactors19-21 were\ninvestigated. During the same period, simple physical separators coupled with\n5disinfection processes were being developed and installed in single houses.19, 22, 23 In\nthe late 1990\u2019s reports also emerged on the use of advanced technologies such as\nMBRs24-27 and alternatively cheaper extensive technologies such as reed beds 28-31 and\nponds.32, 33 Interestingly, only three chemical treatments, photocatalysis35, electro-\ncoagulation34 and conventional coagulation36, were reported in the literature.\nSchemes for greywater recycling have been found in most parts of the world. No\nspecific trend could be identified between the types of treatment used and the\nlocations; although it is thought that poorer countries will favour the use of low cost\nand low maintenance technologies for economic reasons. For instance, Dallas and\nHo37 investigated the use of fragments of PET plastic from water bottles as a cheaper\nmedia in constructed wetlands in Costa Rica. Similarly, in Jordan, Bino38 used a\nsimple, low cost and easy to build treatment system made of plastic barrels. Further,\nin Oman, Prathapar et al.39 designed and tested a low cost, low maintenance system\nbased and activated carbon, sand filtration and disinfection for the treatment of\nablution water in a mosque.\nNo international regulations have been published to control the quality of treated\neffluent for reuse. However, many countries have individually produced their own\nguidelines depending on their needs. Because the main issue when using recycled\nwater is the potential risk to human health, the standards are usually based on\nmicrobial content. However, as has often been shown, the aesthetics of the water to be\nreused is probably as important because of the perception of the public. 40, 41\nTherefore, the standards include parameters for the treatment of the organics and\nsolids fractions such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS)\n6and turbidity. Examples of standards of countries from around the world are reported\nin Table 2. The differences seen in the regulations for water reuse in different\ncountries result in a range of values for the chosen water quality parameters. For\ninstance, standards for BOD, turbidity, faecal coliforms and total coliforms range\nfrom 5-40 mg.L-1, 2-20 NTU, 0-103 cfu.100mL-1 and 0-104 cfu.100mL-1 respectively.\nConsideration of all of the standards from around the world suggests that specific\ntargets of BOD <10 mg.L-1, turbidity <2 NTU and a non detectable level of faecal\ncoliforms.100mL-1 is a sensible conservative level and will be used as the main\nperformance criteria throughout this paper.\nTwenty six of the sixty four schemes reviewed were pilot or bench scale systems for\nresearch purpose. The other 38 systems were full scale as they were fitted in buildings\nand the treated greywaters were reused for specific applications. The different\napplications reported were toilet flushing, irrigation or garden watering, outdoor use\nand cleaning, laundry and infiltration (Table 3). Toilet flushing and irrigation were the\nmost commonly used applications with 54% and 36% of the schemes respectively.\nMost of the full scale schemes were installed in individual houses; only twelve of\nthem were at a bigger scale such as stadiums, hotels, group of houses or residences.\nThe different schemes reported varied a lot in size and the treated effluent flow rates\nwere found to vary between 0.01 and 622 m3.day-1. However, 70% of the schemes (of\nwhich the flow rate was known) had a flow rate below 3.4 m3.day-1 (Figure 1).\nAnother way to evaluate these schemes is to classify them by type of treatment. It was\nthen possible to group them into five categories as follow: simple (coarse filtration\nand disinfection), physical (sand filter, adsorption and membrane), biological\n7(biological aerated filter, rotating biological contactor and membrane bioreactor),\nextensive (constructed wetlands) and chemical (photocatalysis, electro-coagulation\nand coagulation).\nMost of these technologies are operated with a screening or sedimentation stage\nbefore and\/or a disinfection stage (UV, chlorine) after. For instance, Nolde17 reported\nthe treatment of greywater with a rotating biological contactor preceded by a\nsedimentation tank and followed by UV disinfection. Similarly, Friedler25 reported the\nuse of a 1 mm screen and disinfection with hypochlorite respectively before and after\na membrane bioreactor. The most commonly used technologies are the biological\nsystems followed by physical and extensive treatments (Table 4).\nSimple treatment systems\nSimple technologies (Table 5) used for greywater recycling are usually two-stage\nsystems based on a coarse filtration or sedimentation stage to remove the larger solids\nfollowed by disinfection (Figure 2).5, 19, 23 Mars45 reported the use of even simpler\nsystems with only a coarse filter or a sedimentation tank in Western Australia where\nthe regulation allows the reuse of greywater after such simple treatment for subsurface\nirrigation.\nSimple technologies provide only a limited treatment of the greywater in terms of\norganics and solids. To illustrate, average removals of 70, 56 and 49% for COD,\nsuspended solids and turbidity have been reported in the literature (Table 5).\nHowever, good removal of micro-organisms due to the disinfection stage have been\nobserved with total coliforms residuals below 50 cfu.100mL-1 in the treated\n8effluents.19, 23 Consequently, these systems are preferably used at small scale such as\nsingle household. Moreover, they are usually used to treat low strength greywater\nfrom bath, shower and hand basin due to the limited treatment they can achieve and\nsubsequent applications are toilet flushing and garden watering. Little information is\navailable in the literature on the hydraulic performance of these systems; however, the\nhydraulic retention time (HRT) should be short as a result of their simplicity. March et\nal.5 reported an HRT of 38 hours for a large scale system installed in an 81-room hotel\nin Spain.\nSimple systems are marketed and promoted as being simple to use and with low\noperational costs.46 However, two systems installed in individual households in the\nUnited Kingdom with similar capital and operational and maintenance (O & M) costs\nof \u00a31195 and \u00a350\/year and \u00a31,625 and \u00a349\/year respectively were found to be\neconomically unsustainable as the water savings were not sufficient to cover the O &\nM costs.19, 23 Only the scheme located in the hotel in Spain was reported to be\neconomically viable. Indeed, the system including two 300 \u00b5m nylon filters, a\nsedimentation tank and disinfection with sodium hypochlorite had a capital cost of\n17,000 \u20ac (~\u00a311,500) and the O & M cost were calculated at 0.75 \u20ac (~\u00a30.50) per cubic\nmeter. A saving of 1.09 \u20ac (~\u00a30.74) per cubic meter was then attained and a pay back\nperiod of 14 years was obtained with the system operative only 7 months per year.\nChemical treatment systems\nOnly three schemes using a chemical technology for greywater recycling were\nreported in the literature (Table 6; Figure 3). The treatment technology of two of the\nschemes was based on coagulation with aluminium. The first one was a combination\n9of coagulation, sand filter and granular activated carbon (GAC) for the treatment of\nlaundry greywater.36 The second combined electro-coagulation with disinfection for\nthe treatment of a low strength greywater.34 The final example provided a good\ntreatment of the greywater with BOD and suspended solids residuals of 9 mg.L-1, a\nturbidity residual of 4 NTU and undetectable levels of E. Coli. However, it should be\nnoted that the source had a really low organic strength with a BOD concentration of\n23 mg.L-1 in the raw greywater. The first system also achieved good treatment with\nresiduals of 10 mg.L-1 for BOD and below 5 mg.L-1 for the suspended solids, with the\ncoagulation stage itself achieving 51% of the BOD removal and 100% of the\nsuspended solids removal. The two technologies achieved these treatments with rather\nshort contact times. Indeed, the hydraulic retention times in the two schemes were\naround 20 and 40 minutes. Similarly, the third scheme based on photocatalytic\noxidation with titanium dioxide and UV achieved good treatment within a relatively\nshort time. Indeed, with an HRT of less than 30 minutes, it was reported to achieve a\n90% removal of the organics and 6 log removal of the total coliforms.35\nCapital costs of US$0.08\/m3 (~\u00a30.04\/m3) and 0.11 \u20ac\/m3 (~\u00a30.07\/m3) and O & M costs\nincluding energy, consumables, sludge treatment and labour of US$0.19\/m3\n(~\u00a30.10\/m3) and 0.40 \u20ac\/m3 (~\u00a30.27\/m3) were reported for the electro-coagulation\nsystem34 and the coagulation, sand filter and GAC system36 respectively. No\ninformation on water savings were available, it was therefore not possible to assess\nthe viability of these schemes.\nPhysical treatment systems\n10\nPhysical systems (Table 7 & Figure 4) can be divided into two sub-categories; sand\nfilters and membranes. Sand filters have been found to be used alone47 or in\ncombination with disinfection15 or with activated carbon and disinfection.15, 22, 39 Used\nas a sole treatment stage, sand filters provide a coarse filtration of the greywater.\nSimilarly to the simple technologies previously reviewed, sand filters achieved limited\ntreatment of the different fractions present in the greywater. To illustrate, Itayama et\nal.47 described the treatment of high strength kitchen sink water by a soil filter and\nreported removal of 67% for the BOD and 78% for suspended solids with respective\nresidual concentrations of 166 and 23 mg.L-1, well short of any published standards\nfor reuse. When coupled with a disinfection stage, only the removal of micro-\norganisms is obviously improved. Indeed, Hypes et al.15 in their investigation of the\ntreatment of bath and laundry greywater by an earth filter combined with chlorine\nbased disinfection observed poor removal of the turbidity and suspended solids with\nremovals of 47 and 16% respectively. However, the system achieved a 4.8-log\nremoval of the total coliforms and a residual concentration of 34 cfu.100mL-1 was\nmeasured in the effluent. Finally, sand filters in association with activated carbons and\ndisinfection does not result in a significant improvement in the removal of the solids.\nIndeed, average removals of 61 and 48% were reported for turbidity and suspended\nsolids respectively. Nevertheless, good micro-organism removal rates were again\nreported. Prathapar et al.39 and Hypes et al.15 described total coliform concentrations\nin the treated effluents of 0 and 4 cfu.100mL-1. Similarly, CMHC22 reported a faecal\ncoliform residual of 8 cfu.100mL-1 after treatment by sedimentation and a multi media\nfilter.\n11\nHypes et al.15 and Itayama et al.47 reported hydraulic loading rates of 0.32, 0.24 and\n0.086 m3.m-2.d-1 for three systems based on filtration through soil. These were\nextremely low hydraulic loading rates in comparison to typical values reported for\nsimilar systems for the treatment of other waters and wastewaters. Indeed, Metcalf\nand Eddy48 reported hydraulic loading rates ranging from 115 to 576 m3.m-2.d-1 for\nsimple, dual and multi-media filters with sand and\/or anthracite for the treatment of\nwastewater. Similarly, Vigneswaran and Visvanathan49 reported hydraulic loading\nrates of 2-5 and 120-360 m3.m-2.d-1 for slow and rapid sand filter respectively.\nAlternatively, treatment by membranes provided a limited removal of the organics but\nan excellent removal of the dissolved and suspended solids. To illustrate, removal of\nup to 100% of the turbidity and suspended solids have been recorded14, 50, 51, and\notherwise residual concentrations below 2 NTU for the turbidity and below 10 mg.L-1\nfor the suspended solids, sufficient to meet the strictest standards for reuse, were\ngenerally observed. In contrast, Birks47 and Sostar-Turk et al.36 reported BOD\nresiduals of 86 and 53 mg.L-1 respectively, above the criteria for reuse, after treatment\nwith ultra-filtration (UF) membranes.\nHowever, the pore size of the membrane used will have an important impact on the\ntreatment achieved. For example, Ramon et al.51 compared the performance of a\nnano-filtration (NF) membrane with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 0.2 kDa\nand three UF membranes with MWCO of 30, 200 and 400 kDa for the treatment of\nshower water. The performance was shown to be better with lower pore sizes\nespecially in terms of organics removal. Indeed, COD removal of 45, 49, 70 and 93%\nwere reported for the membranes with MWCO of 400, 200, 30 and 0.2 kDa\nrespectively. Differences in turbidity removal performance were less obvious with\n12\nsimilar orders of removal of 92, 94, 97 and 98%. Similarly, Sostar-Turk et al.36\ninvestigated the use of a UF membrane (0.05 \u00b5m pore size) followed by a reverse\nosmosis (RO) membrane for the treatment of laundry wastewater. The UF membrane\ndecreased the BOD from 195 to 86 mg.L-1 corresponding to a removal of 56%. The\nRO membrane then decreased the BOD from 86 to 2 mg.L-1 corresponding to a\nremoval of 98%. A similar trend was observed for the removal of suspended solids\nwith values of 49 and 56% for the UF and RO membranes respectively. Very little\ninformation was available on the removal of micro-organisms by membranes;\nhowever, Jefferson et al.53 reported an average total coliforms removal of 3 log after\nfiltration of greywater through a micro-filtration membrane revealing limited action of\nthe membrane for mico-organisms removal. Similarly, Judd and Till54 reported a\ngeneral breakthrough of E. Coli when treating sewage with a micro-filtration\nmembrane. They also found that this phenomenon was enhanced in the presence of\nproteins suggesting that proteins, when adsorbed on the surface of the membrane,\nfacilitated the transport of the bacteria through the pores.\nThe main issue when operating membranes is fouling. This will have an influence on\nthe operation of the systems and the costs as membrane cleaning will be needed.\nInterestingly, Sostar-Turk et al.36 observed no fouling when treating laundry\nwastewater with a UF membrane for 150 minutes at a flux of about 130 L.m-2.h-1 and\nwith a RO membrane for 120 minutes at a flux of about 37 L.m-2.h-1. Similarly, Ahn\net al.50 reported no fouling during 12 hours for the treatment of greywater through two\nUF membranes and one MF membrane at flux around 200 L.m-2.h-1. These results\nsuggested that no fouling under those conditions occurred in the short term. However,\nNghiem et al.55 investigated the fouling of UF membranes during synthetic greywater\n13\ntreatment. They observed that the fouling increased linearly with the organic matter\n(humic acid) concentration. To limit membrane fouling the membrane stage can be\npreceded by a pre-treatment such as screening or sand filter for example. To illustrate,\nWard56 studied a process combining both physical processes, sand filter and\nmembrane, and disinfection for the treatment of a low strength greywater. With a\nresidual of 8 mg.L-1 for the BOD and undetectable levels of turbidity and E. Coli, the\nsystem was good enough to meet the strictest standards for reuse. This high level of\ntreatment was possible because of the sequence of processes. Indeed, the sand filter\nprovided a pre-treatment by removing the bigger particles. Reductions of the BOD\nfrom 23 to 17 mg.L-1 and turbidity from 18 to 17 NTU were observed. The rest of the\ntreatment was then achieved by the membrane and disinfection stages.\nBiological treatment systems\nA wide range of biological processes have been used for greywater recycling (Table 8\n& Figure 5). Processes such as fixed film reactors17, 19-20, 56-57, rotating biological\ncontactor17, 58, anaerobic filters38, 59, sequencing batch reactor21, membrane\nbioreactors2, 24-27, 60 and biological aerated filters (BAF)2, 18, 52, 61-62 were reported in\nthe literature. Biological systems were rarely used individually and when it was the\ncase it was for investigation of the processes at pilot scale.2, 52 In most cases, the\nbiological processes were preceded by a physical pre-treatment such as\nsedimentation17, 38, 59 or screening18, 57-58 and\/or followed by disinfection.17, 19, 63 They\nwere also combined with membranes in processes such as MBRs24-26, sand filter63,\nactivated carbon18, 19 and constructed wetland.61\nBiological schemes when installed at full scale were the type of treatment most\ncommonly seen in bigger buildings. Indeed, systems could be found in student\n14\nresidences 18-19, 58, multi-storey buildings 17, 20 and stadiums.62, 64 Hydraulic retention\ntimes (HRTs) ranging from 0.8 hours up to 2.8 days were reported for the biological\nsystems. Higher HRTs were observed for systems treating very high strength\ngreywaters such as laundry water24 and mixed greywater38 with BOD concentrations\nof 645 and 300-1200 mg.L-1 respectively. However, HRTs in biological systems were\nreported to be on average 19 hours. Very little information was available on solids\nretention time (SRT) in the biological systems. Organic loading rates were found to\nvary between 0.10 and 7.49 kg.m-3.day-1 for COD and between 0.08 and 2.38 kg.m-\n3.day-1 for BOD. In detail, the average organic loading rate in MBRs was 0.88\nkgCOD.m-3.day-1 which is lower than the typical values of 1.2-3.2 kgCOD.m-3.day-1\nreported by Stephenson et al.65 for wastewater treatment. In contrast, the average\norganic loading rate found for the other systems such as BAF, RBC and bio-films was\n1.32 kgBOD.m-3.day-1 which is in the range of 0.3-1.4 kgBOD.m-3.d-1 reported for these\nsystems.48\nIndependent of the number and type of processes included, all schemes with a\nbiological stage achieved excellent organic and solids removal. Indeed, all the\nbiological systems reviewed but two were reported to meet the most stringent BOD\nstandard for reuse with residual concentrations below 10 mg.L-1. Similarly, the\nturbidity concentrations in the effluents were below 8 NTU for all the systems\nreviewed. And finally, all schemes but one had suspended solids residual below 15\nmg.L-1. In terms of micro-organisms, once again, those schemes including a\ndisinfection stage achieved excellent removals with an average 5.2 log removal for\nfaecal coliforms and 4.8 log for total coliforms. Residual concentrations for both\nfaecal and total coliforms were always below 20 cfu.100mL-1. Interestingly, MBRs\n15\nwere the only systems to achieve good micro-organism removal without the need for a\ndisinfection stage. To illustrate, average removal of both faecal and total coliforms\nwere reported at 5 log and the corresponding residual concentrations were below 30\ncfu.100mL-1. Additionally, MBRs achieved excellent removal of the organic and solid\nfractions with average residuals of 3 mg.L-1 for BOD, 3 NTU for turbidity and 6\nmg.L-1 for suspended solids.2, 24-25, 27, 60 However, Jefferson et al.53 reported that at\nsmall scale, the variation in strength and flow of the greywater and potential shock\nloading affect the performance of biological based technologies.\nTo illustrate, Laine2 investigated the effect of domestic product spiking on biomass\nfrom an MBR and reported that products such as bleach, caustic soda, perfume,\nvegetable oil and washing powder were relatively toxic with EC50 of 2.5, 7, 20, 23 and\n29 mL.L-1 respectively. Moreover, Jefferson et al.66 studied the reliability of a BAF\nand an MBR under intermittent operation of air, feed and both. The performance of\nthe MBR was not affected by interruption of the feed, air or both as the time taken by\nthe process to return to its original performance level was always very short (in fact\nno interruption in performance level was observed). A similar result was found when\nthe feed was stopped for 25 days. However, in comparison, the BAF did not exhibit\nthe same robustness. Although short term interruptions (30 minutes) did not have an\neffect on the BAF performance, longer cessation of the feed and\/or air, generated an\nincrease in the effluent concentrations and the recovery times for all the parameters.\nIndeed, after an interruption of the feed of 8 hours, the recovery times were 4, 4, 40\nand 48 hours for turbidity, suspended solids, faecal coliforms and total coliforms\nrespectively. Similarly, after the same interruption of the air, the recovery times were\n4, 4, 24, 28 and 24 hours for BOD, turbidity, solids, faecal coliforms and total\n16\ncoliforms respectively. The longest recovery times were observed after the\ninterruption of both air and feed simultaneously with 40, 40, 4, 24, 48 hours for BOD,\nturbidity, solids, faecal coliforms and total coliforms respectively. Finally, none of the\nparameters had recovered to their pre-interruption levels within 48 hours of the\ninterruption of the feed for 25 days.\nAgain, limited information is available about the costs of the systems. Surendran and\nWheatley18 reported a capital cost of \u00a33,345 for the construction and installation of a\nretro-fit system in a 40-student residence composed of a buffering tank with\nscreening, an aerated biofilter, a deep bed filter and GAC. The O & M costs were\n\u00a3128\/year including the energy, labour and consumables. With water savings of\n\u00a3516\/year, the pay back period is 8-9 years. They estimated that if the system was\nfitted in a new building the capital cost could be reduced to \u00a31,720 and then the\nadjusted pay back period would be 4-5 years. The system reported by McQuire57\ncomprising a screening filter, a treatment tank with bio-film grown on aggregate balls,\na particle filter and UV disinfection unit installed in an individual house was\nestimated to cost between Aus$6,200 and Aus$8,200 (\u00a32,514-\u00a33,325). Alternatively,\nBino38 reported a low cost, easy to built system composed of four plastic barrels\ninstalled in a 6- person house with a capital cost of US$370 (~\u00a3197). No information\non the operational costs and water savings were reported for these two schemes.\nFinally, Gardner and Millar 63 reported a capital cost of Aus$5,500 (\u00a32,230) and O &\nM costs of Aus$215\/year (\u00a387\/year) for a system based on a septic tank, a sand filter\nand UV disinfection. However, the water savings of Aus$83\/year (\u00a334\/year) were not\nenough to cover the costs. Similarly, Brewer et al.19 estimated the costs of an aerated\nbioreactor combined with a sand filter, GAC and disinfection with bromine installed\n17\nin a student residence at \u00a330,000 for the capital cost. But once again, the O & M costs\nof \u00a3611\/year exceeded the water savings of \u00a3166.\nExtensive treatment technologies\nExtensive technologies for greywater treatment usually comprise constructed\nwetlands such as reed beds and ponds (Table 9 & Figure 6). These are often preceded\nby a sedimentation stage to remove the bigger particles contained in the greywater and\na sand filter to remove any particles or media carried by the treated water. The most\ncommon type of plants used in reed beds is Phragmites australis.28, 31, 67-68 However,\nthey are considered noxious weed species in Costa Rica so Dallas et al.32 and Dallas\nand Ho37 investigated an alternative macrophyte, Coix lacryma-jobi. Alternatively,\ntwo studies have investigated the use of a range of plants. Frazer-Williams et al.68\nreported the use of Iris pseudocorus, Veronica beccabunga, Glyceria variegates,\nJuncus effuses, Iris versicolor, Caltha palustris, Lobelia cardinalis and Mentha\naquatica in their GROW system. Similarly, Borin et al.67 reported a system planted\nwith ten different species (alisma, iris, typha, metha, canna, thalia, lysimachia,\nlytrum, ponyederia and preselia).\nThe constructed wetlands reported in the literature showed good ability to treat\ngreywater. Indeed, an average BOD residual of 17 mg.L-1 was observed and more\nthan half of the extensive treatment schemes reviewed reported a residual BOD\nconcentration below 10 mg.L-1. Similarly, average residual concentrations of 8 NTU\nfor turbidity and 13 mg.L-1 for suspended solids were reported. In contrast, poor\nremoval of micro-organisms was described. Average removal of 3.6 and 3.2 log were\nreported for faecal and total coliforms respectively, with residual concentrations\n18\ngenerally above 102 cfu.100mL-1 for both indicators. In terms of hydraulics, for the\nextensive systems reported, HRT was found to vary from a couple of hours up to a\nyear for on particular scheme composed of three ponds.33 However, after removing\nthe extremes, the HRT for extensive technologies was on average 4.5 days. Borin et\nal.67 compared the performance of two constructed wetlands, one planted with the\ncommon reed Phragmites australis and the second with a range of ten species.\nHowever, no significant differences in treatment effectiveness were observed between\nthe two systems. To illustrate, concentrations in the effluent of 25.8 and 26.6 mg.L-1\nfor the BOD, 20 and 30 mg.L-1 for the total suspended solids and 51.2 and 50.5 mg.L-1\nfor the COD were reported for the systems with the ten species and Phragmites\naustralis respectively.\nBesides being seen as environmentally friendly technologies, constructed wetlands\nhave been considered as cheap options. Indeed, Dallas et al.32 and Shrestha et al.31\ndescribed reed beds with capital costs of US$1,000 (\u00a3531) and US$430 (\u00a3229)\nrespectively and very low operating costs.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nA review of the standards for greywater recycling and the characteristics of\ngreywaters showed that a technology used for the treatment of greywater for reuse\nshould be able to achieve excellent treatment of the organic, solids and microbial\nfractions (Table 2). On the other hand, the review of the greywater recycling schemes\nreported to date proved that different types of technologies achieved very different\nperformance. Simple technologies and sand filters have been shown to achieve only a\nlimited treatment of the greywater whereas, membranes were reported to provide a\ngood removal of the solids but could not efficiently tackle the organic fraction.\n19\nAlternatively, biological and extensive schemes achieved good general treatment of\ngreywater with a particularly good removal of the organics. Although less information\nwas available about chemical systems, they showed promising abilities to treat\ngreywater with short retention times. Micro-organism removal was sufficient to meet\nthe standards only in schemes including a disinfection stage; however, MBRs were\nthe only systems able to achieve good microbial removal without the need for\ndisinfection.\nIn conclusion, the best performances were observed within those schemes combining\ndifferent types of treatment to ensure effective treatment of all the fractions. For\ninstance, Ward56 reported the treatment of a low strength greywater with an aerated\nbiological reactor followed by a sand filter, GAC and disinfection with residual\nconcentrations of 2 mg.L-1 for BOD, 1 NTU for turbidity and <1 cfu.100mL-1 for total\ncoliforms. Similarly, Friedler et al.58 investigated the treatment of bathroom greywater\nby a rotating biological contactor combined with a sedimentation tank, a sand filter\nand disinfection with hypochlorite and reported residuals of 0.6 NTU, 5 mg.L-1, 2\nmg.L-1 and 1 cfu.100mL-1 for turbidity, suspended solids, BOD and faecal coliforms\nrespectively. In contrast, MBRs were the only individual technology (although they\ncomprise a combination of activated sludge and membrane) to be credited with\nsimilar performance.To illustrate, Laine2 reported residuals of 1 mg.L-1 for BOD, 1\nNTU for turbidity, 4 mg.L-1 for suspended solids and 1 cfu.100mL-1 for total\ncoliforms in a greywater treated by a side-stream membrane bioreactor. In the same\nway, Liu et al.27 reported effluent concentrations of <5 mg.L-1 for BOD, <1 NTU for\nturbidity, and undetectable levels of suspended solids and coliforms following\ntreatment by a submerged membrane bioreactor. All these systems met the most\n20\nstringent standards for reuse; however, the level of treatment required is often\ndependent on the reuse applications (Table 2). Consequently, technologies generating\na lesser quality effluent may still be of interest for applications where the standards\nare less strict.\nA review of the HRT applied to each type of system demonstrated that the two\nreviewed chemical systems worked with very low HRT, below an hour. With an\naverage HRT of 19 hours, the biological systems proved to be efficient over rather\nshort periods of time. Finally, the extensive technologies were the systems working at\nthe highest HRT with an average value of 4.5 days. The shorter HRTs observed with\nbiological technologies than with extensive systems for similar performance give an\nadvantage to the biological treatments.\nAnother feature of greywater recycling systems which influences their application is\nthe footprint as space is often limited in urban environments. Systems using\nbiological, chemical or physical technologies have been found to generally have a\nsmaller footprint than extensive technologies. For example, Fittschen and\nNiemczynowicz28 reported a footprint of about 1000 m2 for a scheme including a\nsedimentation tank, a reed bed, a sand filter and a pond treating the greywater of a\n100-inhabitant village, corresponding to 10 m2 per inhabitant connected. Similarly,\nDallas et al.32 reported the treatment of the greywater of 7 persons from 3 houses by a\nsedimentation tank, two reed beds and a pond with a total footprint of about 40 m2,\ncorresponding to 5.7 m2 per person. In contrast, Nolde17 reported a system composed\nof a sedimentation tank, a rotating biological contactor and disinfection installed in\n21\nthe 15 m2 basement of 70-person multi-storey building, corresponding to 0.2 m2 per\nperson connected.\nFinally, we would note that the value of the contribution which the reviewed\ntechnologies can make to sustainable water management will vary as a function of\nlocal circumstances and regional preferences. Ensuring that greywater recycling\nsystems are complementary with Integrated Water Resources Management in\ncatchments or urban contexts will drive a variety of solutions and a variety of\nmeasures of sustainability. Information on Life Cycle Cost and total energy\nrequirements for greywater treatment options is sparse. The trade-offs between scale\nof application, embedded energy in capital equipment, operating energy requirements,\npollutant emissions, reject stream disposal, social costs, etc. etc. are the subject for a\nsubsequent paper. However, the power of circumstance to modify preference can be\ndemonstrated by the fact that a concern with carbon footprint might preclude the use\nof high energy requirement technologies such as the MBR but at larger scales of\napplication and where higher variation in greywater quality is found, the energy\nconsumption of an MBR compared with other options would be much more\nfavourable. The review presented above provides a comprehensive data set for\ndeveloping more detailed and evidenced sustainability assessments.\nReferences\n1.
