INTRODUCTION\nBoth numerical and physical models can be valid instruments for assessing pollutants dispersion in \nthe atmosphere. Models have many advantages with respect to full-scale measurements and can be \nused to support monitoring networks in the evaluation of pollution levels, as established by the \nEuropean legislation (96\/92\/EC).\nA large amount of commercial and research numerical models are currently available for a wide \nrange  of  different  applications,  depending  on  the  specific  case  study  characteristics  (terrain \nconfiguration, meteorological data, source and pollutant typology). Evaluation of numerical code \nresult accuracy and definition of the optimal set up are very important tasks.\nSmall-scale physical models are very useful for developing, improving or testing numerical codes, \nwhich mainly rely on empirical parameters and on field data sets affected by large uncertainties \n(Schatzmann et al., 1997).\nIn this application the dispersion of a tracer from a municipal waste landfill (MWL) was modelled,  \nin order to evaluate the diffusional path of emitted pollutants (mainly odours and hydrocarbons). \nPollutant dispersion from MWL is strongly influenced by fully turbulent, localised flows around the \nplant (specifically referring to a relief one). These conditions represent a challenging problem for \nnumerical models in order to have a sufficient accuracy of the results.\nStarting from these considerations the aim of this study was to build an experimental data set, useful \nfor characterising dispersion phenomena with the aim of numerical codes calibration.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP\nThe experiments were undertaken in the environmental boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) of \nCRIACIV, located in Prato, Italy. This BLWT is a suck-down open channel wind tunnel placed \ninside a closed shed of the Florence University Institute. The working section size is 2.4 m x 1.6 m \nx 4 m, in terms respectively of width, height and length. The wind tunnel has not any devices for \ntemperature stratification simulation, thus only neutral atmosphere can be represented.\nWind flow measurements in the wind tunnel were performed by means of Pitot tubes and single hot \nwire anemometers. Velocity and turbulence characteristics were investigated in details  as useful \nparameters to assess the correct reproduction of the full-scale boundary layer (BL).\nTracer concentration measurement system, with a powered configuration with respect to previous \napplications (see, e.g.,  Contini,  1998; Corti et  al.,  2000; Manfrida et  al.  2001), is based on two \nparallel Flame Ionisation Detectors (FID) devices, and allows up to 24 sample points located inside \nthe working section of the wind tunnel.\nThe small-scale model (scaling factor 1:200) simulates an operating landfill in relief. The full-scale \nheight is 15 m and the base width is about 200 m. The model (see figure 1) is truncated-pyramid-\nshaped with a square base and a top area size 476 x 476 mm2 at a height of 75 mm.\nAn artificial boundary layer, 0.7 m depth (Href) corresponding to 140 m at full scale, was developed \nusing spires vortex generator (Irwin, 1981) and roughness distribution.\nAn accurate evaluation of the flow in the wind tunnel, performing different set-ups, was carried out \nin a previous study (Zipoli, 2002). Vertical and longitudinal velocity profiles showed, at distance \nx\/Href = 0.81 (x axis representing the flow direction with the origin in the centre of the landfill), the \neffect of the landfill shape on the flow, with an increase of the turbulence and a decrease of the \nwind velocity near the ground. This effect is no more present at a distance x\/Href = 2.24.\nIn this study a new set up was applied, varying the roughness parameter in the test section, in order \nto assess the influence of this parameter with respect to the previous experiments. A well-developed \nand stable turbulent flow was performed, having a sufficient reproduction of the flow and having \nnegligible variation in the longitudinal direction. The measured profiles (figure 2 \u2013 the values are \nnormalised with Uref, i.e. the wind speed measured out of the BL, at a reference height of 1.4 m \u2013 \nand  figure  3)  show a  good agreement  with  the  power  law of  the  wind profile  (the  calculated \nexponent varying with the distance around a mean value of 0.155) as well as the logarithmic law, \nwith the assumption of u*\/Uref equal to 0.050 (u* being the friction velocity) and the roughness \nlength z0 equal to 0.25 mm (equal to 0.05 m at full scale), that is to say z0\/Href = 3.57\u22c510-4.\nThe biogas composition (CO2, 45%, CH4, 55%) was estimated using the LandGEM (Landfill Gas \nEmission Model) code, developed by US EPA Control Technology Center. Assuming 80% biogas \ncapture efficiency, a biogas flow rate of 38.1 g s-1 was calculated. Usually biogas emitted from a \nlandfill has quite the same temperature as atmosphere and density is similar too, so that no plume \nrise effects were accounted for. Thus, emission scaling was performed using a standard equation for \nneutrally buoyant releases (Robins, 1977):\nCU ref H ref\n2\nQ\n= f \ue09eW emU ref \ue09f (1)\nwhere Q represents volumetric flow rate, Href is a reference normalisation length (in this case Href is \nthe  boundary  layer  depth),  C is  the  volumetric  concentration  and Wem is  the  vertical  emission \nvelocity.\nThe wind speed at a reference height of 10 m was set to 2 m s-1, both at full scale and at reduced \nscale.  This  means that  Wem must  be the same at  reduced scale  and at  full  scale.  This  was not \npossible to obtain due to the scarce tracer flow at the source. For this reason the flow rate was \narbitrarily  increased  setting  no  limitation  for  the  reduced  scale  wind  velocity.  However  this \napproximation is  still  valid  if  the tracer  flow speed is  negligible  with respect  to the wind flow \n(Obasaju and Robins, 1998).\nThe main characteristics of the scaled model related to full scale properties are reported in table 1.\nIn  order  to  analyse  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  tracer  downwind  of  the  source,  several \nconcentration profiles were carried out: transverse profile measurements at height z\/Href = 0.014 \n(equivalent to 2 m at full scale) at different distances x\/Href downwind of the landfill (0.86, 1.71, \n2.24, 2.57, 2.74 and 3.24); transverse profile measurements at height z\/Href = 0.107 (source height) \nat different distances x\/Href downwind of the landfill (0.86, 1.71, 2.57 and 3.24); vertical profile \nmeasurements at different distances x\/Href downwind of the landfill (0.86, 1.71, 2.57 and 3.24).\nFor each measurement set, a standard closed circuit wind tunnel analytical procedure was applied, \nevaluating the background level concentration upwind the source twice, at the beginning and at the \nend of the measurement set, supposing a linear background concentration growing trend (Contini, \n1998). Concentration measurements were carried out with an averaging time of the FID signal of \nabout 270 s and a sampling frequency of 500 Hz.\nDue  to  the  large  amount  of  variables  affected  by  random error  and  the  non-linear  interaction \nbetween them, an evaluation of the global accuracy of a single concentration measurement is very \ndifficult to be carried out. Thus several repeatability tests of the results were performed in order to \nassess the data accuracy and to monitor the measurement chain performance.\n3. RESULTS\nTransverse mean concentration profiles, measured at z\/Href height of 0.014 (corresponding to 2 m at \nfull scale) are reported in figure 4. A rapidly decrease before a stabilisation at a non-dimensional \ndistance  x\/Href =  2.24  can  be  observed,  as  effect  of  both  source  emission  and  flow instability \ndownwind of the source.  The distribution of the mean concentration at height z\/Href =  0.014 is \nreported in figure 5, obtained as interpolation of the measurement field results.  Transverse mean \nconcentration profiles were also measured at the source height (z\/Href = 0.107), as reported in figure \n6. Comparing these results with concentration measured at z\/Href = 0.014 (figure 4), a remarkable \nincreased  uniformity  of  data  can  be  noticed.  Vertical  mean  concentration  profiles  were  also \nmeasured, as reported in figure 7. From reported data is possible to foreground that the pollutant \nremains mainly near the ground, with a low vertical dispersion.\nIn order to validate the obtained results measurement tests were duplicated both for transverse and \nvertical profiles at different distances from the source. Several tests were also performed in order to \nverify twin measurement by the two different FIDs. A good reproducibility was observed, with a \nrelative error usually lower than 10%. Highest errors were observed near the source, where the flow \nperturbation due to the landfill is higher, and in correspondence of the lower concentration points.\nA detailed analysis of downwind diffusion was performed, basing on the mean height of the plume \nand both vertical and horizontal spread:\n\u00bf z >=\u222b zC \ue09e z \ue09fdz\n\u222bC \ue09e z \ue09fdz\n(2)\nz\u2212\u00bf z\ue085\u00bf\n\u00bf\n\u00bf 2C \ue09e z \ue09fdz\n\u00bf\n\u00bf\n\u222b\u00bf\n\u00bf\n\u03c3 Z\n2=\u00bf\n\u00bf\n(3)\n\u03c3 Y\n2=\n\u222b y 2C \ue09e y \ue09fdy\n\u222bC \ue09e y \ue09fdy\n(4)\nIn figure 8 the mean height versus the distance from the source is reported, while in figure 9 both \nvertical and horizontal spread variations with respect to the distance from the source are reported.\nA constant growth of the plume (<z>) can be observed from results reported in figure 8, with a \nstabilising trend when the distance increases. A key result obtained is that the mean height of the \nplume (<z>) for the nearest profiles is lower than the source height (z\/Href = 0.107), similar to a \n\u201cdownwash effect\u201d on the source.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nA set of experiments concerning the dispersion of a non-buoyant tracer emitted from a landfill,  \nusing a small-scale physical model, was carried out in a boundary layer wind tunnel facility.\nResults can be useful for characterisation of atmospheric dispersion in similar situations (at full-\nscale) and for validation and\/or comparison of mathematical models.\nDespite the difficulties of measuring low concentrations, and of modelling the complex flow near \nthe landfill,  the experiments showed good reproducibility, with relative variation less than 10%, \nconfirming the experimental set-up validity.\nThe results analysis allowed the evaluation of the dispersion parameters, which showed how the \nflow downwind of the landfill, due to induced turbulence, increases the ground level concentration \n(GLC) with a contemporaneous high variability of GLC near the source.\nA phenomenon similar to the \u201cdownwash effect\u201d was foregrounded too, with the analysis of the \nmean plume height (<z>), together with a high ground reflection effect due to both low emission \nheight and the absence of buoyant phenomena.\nHigher GLC data obtained in the model scale field appear to be largely influenced by these near-\nthe-source effects, being located immediately close to the landfill.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support given by SITA FD, particularly from Mr. Livio \nPuglierin, for providing emission data and plant characteristics.\nREFERENCES\nContini, D., 1998.
