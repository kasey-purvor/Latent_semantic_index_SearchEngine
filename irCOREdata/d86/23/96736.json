Introduction\nThe Laplace-Young equation has been the focus of considerable attention since Young\u2019s (1)\nand Laplace\u2019s (2) pioneering work in 1805 and 1806 on free surfaces of a static fluid under\ngravity. A detailed history on the development of this equation is provided in Chapter 1 of\nFinn (3) and references cited within, along with the equation\u2019s rigorous derivation based\non minimum (gravitational, potential and capillary) energy considerations as proposed by\nGauss (4). Exact, non-trivial solutions of the Laplace-Young equation have only been found\nin the cases of a fluid in a semi-infinite domain contact angle \u03b3 with a vertical plane wall,\nor for a fluid between two vertical parallel walls (Landau and Lifshitz, 5). Thus it is not\nsurprising to find a lot of work has been done on determining estimates or bounds on\ncapillary surface heights for various shaped domains, e.g., Concus and Finn (6), Siegel (7)\nand Finn and Huang (8) to mention just a few.\nQ. Jl Mech. Appl. Math.

(14)). These\nasymptotic results have considerable practical applications to industrial problems, such as\nthe dipping of cuboid capacitors into a metallic paste and the subsequent determination\nof the wetted region on which any capacitor connection must occur, see King et al (14).\nAn exact analytical solution to the linearised Laplace-Young equation for arbitrary \u03b3 and a\nrange of wedge angles 2\u03b1, has been found and subsequently used to analyse this capacitor\nproblem in Fowkes and Hood (13).\nUsing polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) (where x = r cos \u03b8, y = r sin \u03b8) based upon the apex of the\nwedge being at r = 0 and the wetted vertical contact boundaries at \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03b1 as shown in\nFigure 1, previous work shows the following asymptotic results for the fluid rise in a corner:\n(a) Small corner angles 0 < \u03b1 < pi\/2\u2212 \u03b3\nHere the height rise u is unbounded as r \u2192 0 and is given by (Concus and Finn, (6))\nu \u223c cos \u03b8 \u2212 (a\n2 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8)1\/2\nar\n+O(r3), (1.1)\nwhere a = sin\u03b1\/ cos \u03b3. Note that in (1.1) and (1.2) below, both u and r are\ndimensionless variables with the appropriate scaling in terms of the capillary length\nscale given in section 2.\n(b) Intermediate corner angles pi\/2\u2212 \u03b3 < \u03b1 < pi\/2 + \u03b3\nSolutions are bounded (Concus and Finn, (6)) in this region (for higher orders when\npi\/2\u2212 \u03b3 < \u03b1 < pi2, see Miersemann, (10))\nu \u223c uo \u2212 r cos \u03b8(a2 \u2212 1)1\/2 + . . . , (1.2)\nwhere uo is the height in the corner.\n(c) Large corner angles pi\/2 + \u03b3 < \u03b1 < pi\nWhile solutions in this region near the corner are still bounded (Concus and Finn,\n(6)), the local slope near r = 0 is not, and a complete asymptotic analysis requires\ninformation on the far field (p.90, King et al (14)). When the solution domain is\nsymmetric about \u03b8 = 0, King et al (14) demonstrate the existence of, and determine\nthe structure of, interior layers which define regions in u, near the corner, on the basis\ncorner solutions of the laplace-young equation 3\nof the level lines of the surface. These layers are located along rays \u03b8 = pi\/2 and\n\u03b8 = \u03b1\u2212 \u03b3, and their structure is independent of far field conditions.\nThe asymptotic results mentioned above apply for arbitrary shaped far field domains\nwhich may influence the local behaviour in the corner in the next order term. Korevaar\n(9) showed that solutions exist for particular shaped domains where there is a jump\ndiscontinuity in u at a re-entrant corner (see p.381 and Theorem on p.384 of 9). This\nis essentially an example of the effect of the far field when it is brought in very close to\nthe corner. King et al (14) have made a systematic study of local corner behaviour for\nall wedge angles, and in addition have found possible approximate mathematical forms for\nthe asymptotic structure of the two transition regimes \u03b1 ' pi\/2 \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03b1 ' pi\/2 + \u03b3\noccurring between (a) \u2013 (b) and (b) \u2013 (c). When the far field has little influence on corner\nbehaviour, Miersemann (11) has shown that (1.1) is accurate to at least O(r3) and proceeds\nto show that a regular expansion exists for all orders in r that is symmetric in \u03b8. For the\nintermediate angle subcase of pi\/2 \u2212 \u03b3 < \u03b1 < pi\/2, a complete expansion around r = 0 by\nMiersemann (10) shows that it is necessary to include logarithmic terms to account for all\npotential far field behaviour.\nIn contrast to the results of King et al (14) and Miersemann (10), we continue our series\nfor intermediate wedge angles (pi\/2\u2212 \u03b3 < \u03b1 < pi\/2) in a regular manner to all orders in r,\nand suggest that the usual practical cases do not show any singular terms at the corner.\nTherefore only symmetric local solutions in the asymptotic construction are considered.\nWe produce an explicit regular series in powers of r (based on an expansion for r small)\nwhere the coefficients are functions of \u03b8, and produce simple explicit recursion formulae for\nthe coefficients which satisfy inhomogeneous linear ordinary differential equations. We also\nshow that these formulae can be continued and evaluated for all powers of r. The reason\nwhy a regular expansion is appropriate, is that when the far field is of sufficient distance\nfrom the corner such that an \u201cinterior flat\u201d region develops, we believe the far field effects\nare lost (both in theory and in practical applications) by means of exponentially small terms\nin the flat region, resulting in a regular series as the (stable) energy minimizing solution.\nIf a fluid is bounded within a symmetric domain about the vertical plane \u03b8 = 0 with\nthe same contact conditions on all finite boundaries, then the uniqueness result of Finn\nand Hwang (8) implies symmetric solutions for u. King et al (14) show that for \u03b1 > pi\/2\nvarious asymptotic solutions can exist in an infinite wedge which exhibit local asymmetry\nin u at the corner when far field boundary conditions are not symmetric. They suggest that\nsymmetric local solutions are \u201cnon-generic\u201d and asymmetric local solutions whose particular\nform depends on far field conditions, may be preferred. However, in contrast, we find that\nasymmetry effects, either from the far field domain shape or boundary conditions applied,\ncan only produce asymmetry in the corner asymptotics when the \u201cfar field\u201d is actually\n\u201cclose\u201d to the corner. By \u201cclose\u201d we mean that the shape of the resulting capillary surface\nhas essentially no inner flat region, and the \u201cfar field\u201d is within several capillary length\nscales from the origin.\nWe computationally verify our expansion through a series of test examples by comparing\nour explicit analytical approximations with a numerical solution based on a finite volume\nmethod with an unstructured mesh. The numerical code has been separately validated\nagainst both radially symmetric and plane wall solutions, together with internally consistent\nconvergence. These numerical examples fully support our above assertions regarding the\n4 j. norbury ET AL.\ninfluence of the far field on local corner behaviour. We provide numerical solutions in a\nwedge with a finite \u201cfar field\u201d at radii 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 capillary length scales from the\norigin, which show that for the \u201cfar field\u201d boundary at distances greater than six capillary\nlength scales, the corner solution is independent of the \u201cfar field\u201d. To reinforce this point\nwe introduce asymmetry into the far field boundary conditions by a factor of ten to one\nfor \u03b8 \u2265 0 compared to \u03b8 < 0, again showing that the solution near the corner remains\nindependent of this effect. Thus we suggest that usually our solution will hold for practical\nproblems, and produce estimates for when it must be modified.\nOur procedure depends on obtaining solutions to (see (3.9))\nLn(un) = fn(\u03b8)\nwhere un(\u03b8) is the coefficient of rn, Ln is a second order linear differential operator with \u03b8\ndependent coefficients which vary with n, and fn(\u03b8) is an n\u2212 2 degree polynomial in cos \u03b8\ncontaining only even (n even) or odd (n odd) powers. Our explicit expansion procedure\ncan be carried out as suggested because of the cancellation of the terms with the highest\npowers of cos \u03b8 in fn, i.e., cosn \u03b8 and cosn\u22122 \u03b8. This depends on establishing that the\nrecurrence identities implied by the vanishing of (3.14) and (3.17) hold for arbitrary n \u2265 2.\nConsequently we show that the solution un(\u03b8) is an nth degree polynomial in cos \u03b8, and\nthat the coefficients of cosn \u03b8 and cosn\u22122 \u03b8 in Ln(un) also vanish for arbitrary n \u2265 2. We\nshow that this fortuitous cancellation must happen in both the homogeneous differential\noperator and the forcing term at each value of n \u2265 2, for such a non-singular expansion to\ncontinue to all orders.\nIt was noted in Siegel (7) that the only nontrivial explicitly known solutions to the\nLaplace-Young equation, are the one-dimensional solutions in either a finite or semi-infinite\ndomain (mentioned earlier). It seems that over the 20 year period since, this has not changed\n(Fowkes and Hood (13), King et al (14)).\n2. Laplace-Young Equation and Series Expansion\nThe governing non-dimensional equation for the shape of the fluid surface around an\narbitrary shaped wedge in polar coordinates is (Seigel (7), Miersemann (10))\n\u2207.\n(\n\u2207u\n[1 + |\u2207u|2]1\/2\n)\n=\n1\nr\n(\nrur\n[1 + u2r + u2\u03b8\/r2]1\/2\n)\nr\n+\n1\nr2\n(\nu\u03b8\n[1 + u2r + u2\u03b8\/r2]1\/2\n)\n\u03b8\n= u, \u2212\u03b1 < \u03b8 < \u03b1 (2.1)\nwith boundary conditions\nu\u03b8 = 0, \u03b8 = 0\nun =\n1\nr\nu\u03b8 = [1 + u2r + u\n2\n\u03b8\/r\n2]1\/2 cos(\u03b3) , \u03b8 = \u03b1 , (2.2)\nwhere u = u\u2217\u221a\u03ba, r = r\u2217\u221a\u03ba, \u03ba is the capillary constant and u\u2217, r\u2217 are the dimensional\nvariables. Here the gravitational constant has been absorbed within \u03ba so that r is a measure\nin capillary lengthscales from the wedge apex. Note that (2.2) can also be written as(u\u03b8\nr\n)2\n=\n1 + u2r\ntan2 \u03b3\n, \u03b8 = \u03b1. (2.3)\ncorner solutions of the laplace-young equation 5\nAs discussed in the Introduction, we consider only intermediate corner angles, pi\/2 \u2212 \u03b3 <\n\u03b1 < pi\/2, where the far field has negligible influence on the corner behaviour. Following on\nfrom Miersemann (10),(11) we therefore write a regular power series solution for u(r,\u03b8) as\nu(r, \u03b8) = uo + ru1(\u03b8) + r2u2(\u03b8) + r3u3(\u03b8) ... =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nrnun(\u03b8), (2.4)\nwhere uo is the height of the fluid at r = 0. In the following sections we proceed to\ndetermine the general form of the boundary value problem for each un(\u03b8) along with their\nexplicit solutions.

It is interesting to note that the right hand side of (2.14) for any n\nsimplifies to fn as given in (3.9).\n3.1 Homogeneous Equation\nWhile fn in (3.9) contains terms up to cosn\u22122\u03b8, un contains terms up to cosn\u03b8. After\nsubstituting for (3.10) into (3.9), the three leading powers for cos\u03b8 are cosn+2\u03b8, cosn\u03b8 and\ncosn\u22122\u03b8, hence to match the leading order term in fn, the coefficients of cosn+2\u03b8, cosn\u03b8 must\nbe zero for arbitrary n. To prove this we first rewrite (3.9) with z =cos\u03b8 as the independent\nvariable, so that we have\n(1 +A2z2)(1\u2212 z2)u\u2032\u2032n \u2212 z[1 + 2(n\u2212 1)A2 \u2212 (2n\u2212 3)A2z2]u\u2032n+\nn[n+ (n\u2212 1)A2 \u2212 (n\u2212 2)A2z2]un = fn(z) , cos\u03b1 \u2264 z \u2264 1 . (3.11)\nIf we substitute\nun(z) = ... + cn,n\u22122zn\u22122 + cn,nzn ,\ninto (3.11) and collect the coefficients of zn+2, zn we obtain\n\u2212cn,nA2[n(n\u2212 1) + n(3\u2212 2n) + n(n\u2212 2)]zn+2\n+cn,n[n(n\u2212 1)(A2 \u2212 1)\u2212 2A2n(n\u2212 1)\u2212 n+ n2 + n(n\u2212 1)A2]zn\n\u2212cn,n\u22122A2[(n\u2212 2)(n\u2212 3) + (3\u2212 2n)(n\u2212 2) + n(n\u2212 2)]zn ,\n(3.12)\nwhich are identically zero for arbitrary n. In the next section we show that the equivalent\npowers on the right hand side in fn(z) also vanish for all n.\n10 j. norbury ET AL.\n3.2 Order of fn(\u03b8)\nWe suggest in (3.9) that the highest power of cos(\u03b8) in fn(\u03b8) is n-2, but since uj goes like\ncosj(\u03b8) or uj1, then the right hand side of (2.14) shows that there exist terms proportional to\nboth un+21 and u\nn\n1 . Consequently their coefficients must be zero. We proceed to show this\nby establishing that the formulae (3.14) and (3.17) given below identically vanish. Consider\nonly the highest two powers terms of any uj and write these as\nuj(\u03b8) = C\nj\nju\nj\n1 + C\nj\nj\u22122u\nj\u22122\n1 with C\nj\n1 = 1, C\nj\n\u22121 = 0 , (3.13)\nwhere Cjk = A\n\u2212kcj,k(note that if j = k we will use the simpler notation Cj ). Substituting\nthis into the non-binomial terms in (2.14), and making use of the identities u\u2032\u20321 =\n\u2212u1 , u\u2032 21 = A2 \u2212 u21, gives the following equation for the coefficient of un+21\n2\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=2\nj(j \u2212 n)(n+ 1\u2212 j)CjCn+1\u2212j\n+ 2\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=2\nn\u2212k+1\u2211\nj=1\nCkCjCn\u2212k\u2212j+2kj(n\u2212 k \u2212 j + 2)(2k + j \u2212 n\u2212 2) .\n(3.14)\nWe now show that (3.14) identically vanishes for any Cj , j = 2, ..., n-1. Changing the order\nof the summation in the second term of (3.14) results in\n2\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=2\nn\u2212k+1\u2211\nj=1\nCkCjCn\u2212k\u2212j+2kj(n\u2212 k \u2212 j + 2)(2k + j \u2212 n\u2212 2)\n= 2\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=2\nCkCn+1\u2212kk(n\u2212 k + 1)(2k \u2212 n\u2212 1)\n+ 2\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=2\nn\u2212j+1\u2211\nk=2\nCkCjCn\u2212k\u2212j+2\n[\nk2(n\u2212 k \u2212 j + 2)\u2212 k(n\u2212 k \u2212 j + 2)2] j .\n(3.15)\nAs k goes from 2 to n\u2212 1, n\u2212 k+1 goes from n\u2212 1 to 2 while 2k \u2212 n\u2212 1 goes from 3\u2212 n\nto n \u2212 3, hence the first term on the right hand side of (3.15) is zero. Noting that due to\nsymmetry the square bracketed term is also zero for k = 2..n \u2212 j, then the only nonzero\nterm arises for k = n\u2212 j + 1 thus\n2\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=2\nn\u2212k+1\u2211\nj=1\nCkCjCn\u2212k\u2212j+2kj(n\u2212 k \u2212 j + 2)(2k + j \u2212 n\u2212 2)\n= \u22122\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=2\nCn+1\u2212jCj(n+ 1\u2212 j)(j \u2212 n)j\n, (3.16)\nand hence the second term in (3.14) cancels the first. This completes the proof that the\ncoefficient of un+21 is zero.

First note\nthat the terms containing A in (3.17) are equivalent to (3.14) and therefore cancel. Secondly\nby changing the counter for the final term in the single summation to j = n+1\u2212s and to\nj = n\u2212 k \u2212 s+2 for the third term in the double summation, (3.17) can be written as\n2\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=2\n(n\u2212 1)(2\u2212 j)(n+ 1\u2212 j)Cjj\u22122Cn+1\u2212j\n+ 2\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=2\nn\u2212k+1\u2211\nj=1\nCkC\nj\nj\u22122Cn\u2212k\u2212j+2 k(n\u2212 k \u2212 j + 2)(3kj \u2212 4k \u2212 nj \u2212 2j + 2n+ 2)\n+ 2\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=2\nn\u2212j+1\u2211\nk=1\nCkC\nj\nj\u22122Cn\u2212k\u2212j+2 k(n\u2212 k \u2212 j + 2)(2j2 + kj \u2212 nj \u2212 4j + 2) ,\n(3.18)\nafter swapping the counters in the final term of (3.18). Next take out k = 1 from the third\nterm in (3.18) and combine it with the single summation. Then j =1 in the second term\nis redundant since it gives coefficients containing Cj\u22121which are by definition zero, thus\nthe second and third terms can be combined and following a change in the order of this\nsummation (3.18) simplifies to\n4\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=2\n(j \u2212 1)(j \u2212 n)(n+ 1\u2212 j)Cjj\u22122Cn+1\u2212j +\n4\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=2\n(j \u2212 1)Cjj\u22122\nn\u2212j+1\u2211\nk=2\nCkCn\u2212k\u2212j+2\n[\nk2(n\u2212 k \u2212 j + 2)\u2212 k(n\u2212 k \u2212 j + 2)2] . (3.19)\nThe term in the square brackets is always zero due to symmetry, except for k = n \u2212 j+1\nwhen it then cancels the single summation, hence (3.17) is also zero.\nConsidering now the binomial term in (2.14), it is clear that if we expand this out then\nas long as j(m+2\u2212 j)ujum+2\u2212j +u\u2032ju\u2032m+2\u2212j is zero for the highest order terms in u1, then\noverall the binomial terms only contribute to terms in cos\u03b8 of at most un\u221221 . From (2.14)\nand (3.13) we then have\nj(m+ 2\u2212 j)ujum+2\u2212j + u\u2032ju\u2032m+2\u2212j\n= j(m+ 2\u2212 j)CjCm+2\u2212j um+21 \u2212 j(m+ 2\u2212 j)CjCm+2\u2212j um+21 = 0 .\n(3.20)\n3.3 Recurrence Relations Between c and b\nIn this section we develop the recurrence relations between the coefficients cn,j in the solution\nun(z)(z = cos \u03b8) and the constants bn,j from fn(z) in (3.9).

(3.30)\n4. Numerical Results\nThe usefulness of the expansion (2.4) together with our explicitly found u1(\u03b8), u2(\u03b8), ..., is\nnow shown by comparing it with the numerical solution of (2.1) and (2.2) from Scott et al\n(15), based on a finite volume method with an unstructured mesh on an arbitrary shaped\ndomain. Scott et al (15) have shown that their scheme is second order and can obtain\nsolutions accurate to 4 significant figures when matched against the plane wall case and\nradially symmetric solutions of (2.1).\nIn order to investigate our assertion that the far field behaviour has negligible effects on\nthe height rise in the corner when there is an \u201cinterior flat region\u201d, we numerically solve\n(2.1) on the domain 0 \u2264 r \u2264 R, subject to the following boundary conditions\n1\nru\u03b8 = \u00b1[1 + u2r + u2\u03b8\/r2]1\/2 cos(\u03b3) , \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03b1\nur = \u2212\u03b2+ru , r = R , \u03b8 \u2265 0\nur = \u2212\u03b2\u2212ru , r = R , \u03b8 < 0 .\n(4.1)\nThe role of \u03b2+ and \u03b2\u2212 is to force asymmetry in the solution, about \u03b8 = 0, and then to\nobserve its effect on the behaviour of the fluid surface in the corner. Figure (2) is a plot of the\nheight of the capillary surface as a function of \u03b8r\/ |\u03b8| for \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03b1, for various sized domains\nR as indicated, with \u03b2+ =1 and \u03b2\u2212 = 10. It is clear from figure (2) that the far field\u2019s\nbehaviour on the corner is indeed negligible, and that asymmetry effects from the boundary\nconditions are also lost (through exponentially small terms) once an interior flat region is\nformed. The appearance of an interior flat region seems to occur at around 2 \u2013 3 capillary\nlengthscales from the origin, which is in agreement with the linearised solutions of Fowkes\nand Hood (13). The extent of the loss of asymmetry effects on the corner asymptotics is\nfurther demonstrated by noting that three significant figure agreement between the heights\non the \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03b1 walls occurs for r < 0.5, R = 6, r < 2.2, R = 8 and r < 5.7 when R = 10.\nFigure (3) gives a comparison of the power series solution (2.4) with the numerical\nsolution along the wall for r \u2264 0.5 when R \u2265 6, as figure (2) shows graphically there\nis no difference between the numerical solutions in this region. We choose \u03b8 = \u03b1 for\nthe comparison since the r-derivatives are largest along the wall and the \u03b8-derivatives are\ngreatest where the fluid surface comes off the wall. Thus, \u03b8 = \u03b1 is the most demanding case\nnumerically. At least the same level of accuracy is found locally for all \u03b8 around r = 0. It\nis again clear that the power series solution provides an accurate description of the correct\ncorner behaviour, and these results also show that while logarithmic terms may be needed\n14 j. norbury ET AL.\n0 . 0\n0 . 2\n0 . 4\n0 . 6\n0 . 8\n1 . 0\n1 . 2\n- 1 0 - 8 - 6 - 4 - 2 0 2 4 6 8 1 0\nD i s t a n c e  a l o n g  w a l l\nH\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\n \na\nt\n \nw\na\nl\nl\nR = 1 0\nR = 8\nR = 6\nR = 4\nR = 2\nR = 1\nFig. 2 Fluid height along each wall for different size solution domains 0 \u2264 r \u2264 R, \u2212\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b1.\nAll curves are for wedge angle \u03b1 = pi\/3, contact angle \u03b3 = pi\/4, with significantly nonsymmetric\nouter boundary conditions at r = R being ur = Ru on \u03b8 \u2265 0 and ur = \u221210Ru on \u03b8 < 0.\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0.8\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n1.15\n1.2\nr\nu\n(r,\u03b1\n)\nr numerical\nr2r4r6\nFig. 3 Comparison of regular power series and numerical solutions near the apex r = 0 for R = 6\nwith 2\u03b1 = pi\/3 and \u03b3 = pi\/4.

(4.2)\nThis solution applies for contact angles near pi\/2 and can be expanded around r = 0 to give\nu(r, \u03b8)\ncos \u03b3\n= 2\u2212\n\u221a\n2 cos \u03b8 r +\nr2\n2\n\u2212 r\n3\n3!\n\u221a\n2\n(\n3 cos \u03b8 \u2212 2 cos3 \u03b8)+O(r4). (4.3)\nIt is straightforward to show that when \u03b1 = pi\/4 and \u03b3 near pi\/2, our series solution (2.4),\nfor the full nonlinear equations, reproduces (4.3).\nIn summary then, we have shown that a straightforward symmetric power series solution\nis sufficient to describe more accurate (higher order) behaviour for the fluid rise in the corner\nof a wedge with static fluid acted on by gravity. The solution applies for intermediate wedge\nangles, when an interior flat region exists, even if the outer (far field) boundary conditions\nare nowhere near symmetric about \u03b8 = 0. We derive such a series solution for all orders in r,\nand determine simple explicit recurrence relations for the coefficient functions which satisfy\nnonhomogeneous linear second order ordinary differential equations in \u03b8 with Neumann and\nRobin boundary conditions.\nReferences\n1.
