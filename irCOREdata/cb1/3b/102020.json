INTRODUCTION\nA recent major advance in molecular dynamics has been\nthe extensive use of electric fields to orient molecules in\norder to study spatial effects in reactive scattering, spectros-\ncopy, and photodissociation.1\u20139 This method, known as the\nbrute force technique, was initially applied to linear and di-\natomic molecules and then extended to symmetric and asym-\nmetric polar molecules. A molecule in a moderately strong\nelectric field exhibits two different regimes: pendular motion\nabout oriented states at low energies and almost free rota-\ntional motion at high energies. The former quantum states\ncan be labeled by a pendular quantum number, while the\nlatter are labeled by the usual total angular momentum. This\nsystem is a quantum realisation of the Lagrange top which is\none of the most fundamental classical systems with\nmonodromy.11,10 When the energy levels of the quantum\nstates are plotted against a conserved quantity, such as the\nprojection of the total angular momentum onto the direction\nof the electric field, then it is observed that some series of\nlevels with the same total angular momentum or same pen-\ndular number display a characteristic kink. Moreover, if the\nconstant total angular momentum series are smooth, then the\nconstant pendular quantum number series have a kink and\nvice versa. A similar kink phenomenon occurs for rotating\nbending states of quasilinear molecules for which it is pos-\nsible to use either the quantum labelling for bent molecules\n(n ,K) or that for linear molecule (n ,l).12\nIt has been shown that for both linear molecules in elec-\ntric fields and quasilinear molecules this behavior is due to\nthe presence of monodromy.12,13 It should be noted that the\nmonodromy is a universal phenomenon but the kink is not.\nFor integrable classical mechanical systems with two degrees\nof freedom monodromy is an obstruction to the existence of\nglobal action angle variables14 and is present whenever the\nenergy-momentum map has a singular fibre in the form of a\n\u2018\u2018pinched torus.\u2019\u2019 15\u201318 Monodromy has been studied in a va-\nriety of model systems, including the \u2018\u2018champagne bottle\u2019\u2019 or10520021-9606\/2003\/118(23)\/10523\/11\/$20.00\nDownloaded 09 Oct 2007 to 131.227.178.135.

This has been demonstrated for the spherical\npendulum21 and the champagne bottle potential.13 Mono-\ndromy has also been discovered in one of the most basic\natomic systems: hydrogen atom in orthogonal electric and\nmagnetic fields.22 A general semiclassical theory relating\nquantum and classical monodromy is given in Refs. 23, 24\nand further applications to atomic and molecular systems in\nRefs. 25\u201327.\nThe appearance of monodromy in classical mechanical\nsystems is closely related to the occurrence of Hamiltonian\nHopf bifurcations of relative equilibria.28,29 In our case, a\nrelative equilibrium of a molecule is a steady motion in\nwhich the molecule rotates about a fixed axis without chang-\ning its shape. It is therefore an equilibrium state in an appro-\npriate rotating frame. Relative equilibria have been used as\n\u2018\u2018organizing centers\u2019\u2019 for molecular spectra at high angular\nmomenta in much the same way as equilibria are used for\nvibrational and low angular momentum spectra.30\u201334 They\nappear in families parametrized by total angular momentum\nand typically undergo a number of bifurcations as the angu-\nlar momentum is increased. Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations\noccur when two normal mode frequencies become equal and\nthen complex, resulting in loss of stability. This is not un-\ncommon: any given rotating molecular system is likely to\nexhibit several such bifurcations as the angular momentum is\nincreased.33,34 Of course molecular systems are not inte-\ngrable. However integrable approximations often provide\nuseful models. For example, the monodromy present in lin-\near molecules in electric fields and quasilinear molecules can\nbe explained using approximations by the spherical pendu-\nlum and champagne bottle potential, respectively.12,13 In the\ncase of Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations normal form theory\nintroduces extra approximate symmetries and conserved3 \u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\no AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/jcp\/copyright.jsp\n10524 J.

Robertsquantities near the bifurcation point and these can be used to\nconstruct local integrable approximations.28 None of these\napproximations will be valid globally.\nIn this paper we study bifurcations of relative equilibria\nand the quantum monodromy of a rigid symmetric top with\nan electric dipole in an electric field. This is an integrable\napproximation used to model the orientation of quasi-\nsymmetric top molecules by electric fields. It is mathemati-\ncally identical to the Lagrange top, which is known to have a\nHamiltonian Hopf bifurcation.10,28,35 Its conserved quantities\ninclude the angular momenta about both the field axis and\nthe symmetry axis of the body. In applications to quasisym-\nmetric top molecules the angular momentum about the sym-\nmetry axis will only be conserved approximately. The paper\nhas several aims, including a description of the quantum\nmonodromy of the Lagrange top using its relative equilibria\nas a \u2018\u2018skeleton,\u2019\u2019 a description of the effect of the Hamil-\ntonian Hopf bifurcation on quantum monodromy, some re-\nmarks on perturbations away from complete integrability,\nand, perhaps most importantly, a discussion of the implica-\ntions of these results for the spectroscopy of quasisymmetric\nmolecules in electric fields.\nIn Sec. II we describe the stability and bifurcations of\nrelative equilibria of axisymmetric rigid bodies in electric\nfields, recalling earlier results on the Lagrange top.11,35\u201338 In\nSec. III we present plots of the energies of quantum states\nagainst the angular momentum about the symmetry axis of\nthe body and show how the structures observed are orga-\nnized by the relative equilibrium bifurcation diagrams of\nSec. II. This is followed by discussions of the effects of\nperturbations away from symmetry and the critical field\nstrength needed to observe monodromy.\nII. CLASSICAL THEORY\nThe Hamiltonian for a rigid top molecule with a dipole\nof strength m parallel to the molecular z-axis in a static elec-\ntric field of strength E can be written as\nH5aJz\n21bJx\n21cJy\n22mE cos u , ~1!\nwhere the Ja are the projections of the total angular momen-\ntum onto the molecule fixed axis system and the angle u is\nthe angle between the molecule z-axis and the electric field\naxis. Small letters are used for the rotational constants to\navoid confusion with traditional capital letters which nor-\nmally assume A.B.C . We allow for a , b , and c any\nphysically possible values but restrict the z-axis to be fixed\nalong the dipole. Then a top which is symmetric about its\ndipole axis satisfies b5c . Following convention, the rota-\ntional constants have the dimension of energy while the an-\ngular momentum is dimensionless. The Hamiltonian of a\nsymmetric top in electric field is commonly expressed in\ndimensionless form by\nH\/b5J21~g21 !Jz22v cos u , ~2!\nwhere g5a\/b and the new dimensionless field parameter\nv5mE\/b .

Prolate molecules are given by g.1 and oblate mol-\necules by g,1.\nLet n5(nx ,ny ,nz) be a unit vector in the field direction\nreferred to the molecular axis system. Note that nz5cos u.\nThe Hamiltonian ~2! is invariant under both rotations about\nthe field axis in the space fixed frame and rotations of the\nmolecule about its symmetry axis. The corresponding con-\nserved quantities are the angular momenta of the molecule\nabout the two axes, m5J.n and k5Jz , respectively. This\nmakes it possible to reduce the original three-dimensional\nproblem to a one-dimensional system. However in this paper\nwe will usually describe classical bifurcations and quantum\nspectra by fixing m and allowing k to vary. This makes the\nproblem effectively two dimensional. Such a view is natural\nsince for real molecules k will only be approximately con-\nserved.\nA. Relative equilibria\nThe classical equations of motion for the Hamiltonian\n~1! can be written as,10,11,39\nJ\u02d95J3\n]H\n]J 1n3\n]H\n]n\n, ~3!\nn\u02d95n3\n]H\n]J . ~4!\nFor an axisymmetric rigid body the relative equilibria are the\nsolutions of these equations for which the motion consists of\nsteady rotation about its symmetry axis combined with\nsteady rotation of the symmetry axis about the field axis.\nEquivalently, the relative equilibria with angular momenta\nJz5k about the symmetry axis and J.n5m about the field\naxis are the critical points of H constrained to the surface,\nJz5k , J.n5m , n.n51.\nA calculation shows that there are three types of relative\nequilibria satisfying, respectively,\nP: J5~0,0,m !, n5~0,0,1 !, k5m; ~5!\nAP: J5~0,0,m !, n5~0,0,21 !, k52m; ~6!\nTk: J5~Jxy cos f ,Jxy sin f ,k !, ~7!\nn5~sin u cos f ,sin u sin f ,cos u!,\nf2arbitrary, Jxy5~m2k cos u!\/sin u ,\nv sin4 u12~k cos u2m !~m cos u2k !50.\nThe P and AP relative equilibria are those for which the field\nand molecule symmetry axes are aligned. For the AP relative\nequilibrium the dipole is opposite to that of the electric field,\nwhile for the P relative equilibrium they are the same. We\ntherefore refer to them as being antiparallel and parallel,\nrespectively.\nFor Jxy\u00de0 the field and symmetry axes of the Tk rela-\ntive equilibria are not aligned and so we refer to them as\ntilted relative equilibria. The parallel and antiparallel relative\nequilibria are limits of families of tilted relative equilibria as\nJxy\u21920.

The same is true for k52m if umu>A2v , but if the\ninequality is reversed there exists a unique tilted relative\nequilibrium in addition to the anti-parallel relative equilib-\nrium.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 1, where the angle u is calcu-\nlated for various k and v but fixed projection m55 using Eq.\n~7!. The results for other values of m are qualitatively the\nsame. The parallel and antiparallel relative equilibria are in-\ndicated by empty and filled circles respectively. Note that u\ndoes not depend on the ratio g5a\/b . When the field is small\nboth P and AP relative equilibria lie on a curve of tilted\nrelative equilibria. However when v exceeds m2\/2, the anti-\nparallel equilibrium bifurcates and becomes isolated. In this\nlatter case the angle u for a tilted relative equilibrium\nachieves a maximum when the ratio m\/k is less than 21.\nThe maximum tends to p\/2 as the field strength increases.\nAmong the tilted relative equilibria Tk we distinguish\nthose which give extrema of the energy as k is varied. These\ncorrespond to relative equilibria for which the angular veloc-\nity about the symmetry axis of the molecule is 0. Calcula-\ntions show that for each fixed m and v there is at most one of\nthese, which we denote by T. The set of P, AP, and T relative\nequilibria is parameterized by m and can be tuned by the\nfield strength parameter v.\nB. Linear stability of P and AP relative equilibria\nIn this section we discuss the stability of the P and AP\nrelative equilibria, considered as equilibrium points of the\nrestriction of the Hamiltonian ~2! and equations of motion\n~3!, ~4! to J.n5m , n.n51. Near the P and AP relative equi-\nlibria we can take Jx , Jy , nx , and ny as coordinates and the\nlinearized equations of motion are then\nFIG. 1.

However as the field strength increases the relative\nequilibria may change stability and undergo bifurcations.\nThe points where these changes occur depend only on g and\nv\/m2 and are summarized in Fig. 2.\nThe frequencies of the P relative equilibria are always\nreal, V1 is always strictly positive but V2 is equal to 0\nwhen v\/m252g(g21).

The relationship ~17! is clearly visible in Figs. 4\nand 5. For prolate molecules ~Fig. 4! the high energy states\nwith constant J form parabolas which curve upwards (g\n.1), while for oblate molecules ~Fig. 5! they form parabo-\nlas which curve downwards (g,1). The validity of the free\nrotor approximation is particularly apparent in Fig. 6, where\nthe energy levels for g50.8 and v550 are plotted against\nboth k for fixed m52 and against m for fixed k52. It is\nclearly seen that the top levels form almost straight lines.\nThis signifies degeneracy in m because the levels project\nnearly to one point on the energy axis.\nFor the lowest energy states with given quantum num-\nbers k and m we can apply a quantum harmonic approxima-\ntion to the one-dimensional system ~13! to obtain the follow-\ning estimate for their energies:\nE~k ,m ,n!\nb \u2019\nE~Tk!\nb 1S n1 12 DVpen .\nThis in turn can be used to describe the quantum states that\nare localized near the P relative equilibrium.

Note\nthat states with the same n will generally have different\nnodal structures because they may have different values of n.\nThe upward curving parabolas formed by states with the\nsame value of n are clearly visible in Figs. 4 and 5 near the\nP relative equilibrium.\nAlthough the approximate spectra given by Eqs. ~17!\nand ~20! are only valid for free and localized states, respec-\ntively, the labelling by quantum numbers (J ,k ,m) and\n(k ,m ,n) can be extended to all states by using Eqs. ~16! and\n~19!.

The resulting constant J and constant n families\nof states are illustrated in Fig. 6 by solid and dashed lines,\nrespectively. The constant J lines are smooth above the AP\nrelative equilibrium, but have a kink below it. In other\nwords, along the curves below the AP relative equilibrium\nthe derivative of the energy with respect to k ~or m) has a\ndiscontinuity at k52m . A similar discontinuity occurs\nalong the constant pendular number n curves above the AP\nrelative equilibria.\nB. Monodromy\nThe quantum effect of monodromy is illustrated in Fig.\n6, which shows the energy levels of a symmetric top with\ng50.8 in a field v550. In the first panel the energy levels\nare plotted against k while the angular momentum projection\nonto the field direction is fixed at m52. In the other panel\nthe angular momentum projection onto the symmetry axis is\nfixed at k52 while m is allowed to vary. Both diagrams\nillustrate the effect of translating a unit cell of the lattice of\nenergy-momentum points about the AP relative equilibrium:\nthe cell does not return to itself after a complete circuit. If an\nanalogous operation is performed around a circuit that does\nnot include the AP point then the cell would return to itself.\nIt follows from this that there is no possible choice of quan-\ntum numbers which can work globally in the whole neigh-\nborhood around AP point. This phenomenon was first de-\nscribed for the quantum spherical pendulum by Cushman\nand Duistermaat,21 for the champagne bottle potential by\nChild13 and for the hydrogen atom in crossed fields by Cush-\nman and Sadovskii.22 A rigorous general account has been\ngiven by Vu Ngoc.23,24 A semiclassical analysis of the rela-\ntionship between monodromy and the kinks in the constant J\nand constant n curves of quantum states is given in Refs. 12\nand 13, Zhilinskii and Sadovskii have established a connec-\ntion between monodromy and energy level redistribution25\nand described monodromy as a defect in the lattice of energy\nlevels in the energy-momentum diagram.\nWhen k50 the Lagrange top degenerates to a system\nthat is equivalent to the spherical pendulum. The plot of\nenergy against m in this case is therefore the same as the\ndiagram in Ref. 21 and Fig. 4 of Ref. 12, and is very similar\nto the m50 diagram with energy plotted against k for oblate\nmolecules shown in the first panel of Fig. 5 of this paper. All\nthe k50 and m50 diagrams share the property that they\nhave a reflectional symmetry and the AP relative equilibrium\nis a monodromy point lying on the axis of symmetry above\nthe P relative equilibrium. However, as k or m is moved\naway from zero this reflectional symmetry is broken and the\nAP relative equilibrium moves towards the boundary curve\nconsisting of Tk relative equilibria. As described in Sec. II C\nthe Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation corresponds to the point\nwhere the AP relative equilibrium reaches the boundary\ncurve and \u2018\u2018sticks\u2019\u2019 to it.

However after the Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation both\nclassical and quantum monodromy disappear and uniform\nlabelling of quantum states by either of the sets of quantum\nnumbers (J ,k ,m) or (k ,m ,n) is possible.\nC. Quasisymmetric top\nTo observe the phenomena described above in a real\nquasisymmetric molecule it is necessary that they persist\nwhen the symmetry of the molecule is broken slightly. The\nmain problem here is the construction of the energy level\nlattice or, equivalently, the definition of appropriate ~approxi-\nmate! quantum numbers. One approach is to perturb away\nfrom the symmetric top molecule with the field turned on\nand label the quasi-symmetric states by the quantum num-\nbers of the symmetric states they correlate back to. An ex-\nample of this is given in Fig. 7 which shows the energy\nlevels of a prolate symmetric top ~as given in Fig. 4! together\nwith the levels of an asymmetric top with similar rotational\nconstants. Although there is some distortion to the lattice it is\nclear that the main qualitative features persist. In particular\nthe region of pendular states seems to be almost unaffected\nby the perturbation and the pendular quantum number is still\nuseful in the region of localization.\nA second approach to constructing an energy level lattice\nfor asymmetric molecules in an electric field is to perturb\naway from the zero field limit, while preserving the rota-\ntional constants, and label the perturbed states by the quan-\ntum numbers of the free rigid body states they correlate to.\nThis is the approach taken in Ref. 9 and applied successfully\nto the quantum states of acetylene-HF in strong electric\nfields. Their pendular group number n52J2uM\n1(21)sKau, where s5J112Ka2Kc , is completely\nanalogous to our pendular number n given by Eq. ~21!. For\nthe example of Fig. 7 this perturbation shows that the struc-\nture of the upper energy levels in the diagram is very close to\nthe free rotation structure for a molecule with the same rota-\ntional constants.\nAnalogs of much of the classical skeleton described in\nSec. II persist for general asymmetric rigid molecules in\nelectric fields. In particular the P, AP, and T relative equilib-\nria remain, though their bifurcations are different.36\u201338 More-\nover the Tk relative equilibria, which form the boundaries of\nthe energy-momentum diagrams, persist as relative periodic\norbits. In future work we hope to analyze the way these\nclassical trajectories organize the quantum states of general\nasymmetric molecules.\nD. Critical field strength\nFigures 4, 5, and 6 given above present fixed m or fixed\nk slices through the total three-dimensional system of levels\nwhich lies over the (m ,k) plane. If presented in this way, the\nAP relative equilibria form a line which passes through the\nthree-dimensional energy level structure.10,11,26 In this sense\nclassical monodromy exists at any field strength E\u00de0. How-\never quantum monodromy will only be observable if theDownloaded 09 Oct 2007 to 131.227.178.135. Redistribution subject tmonodromy point is surrounded by a sufficient number of\nlevels. In particular at least two levels should be located\nbetween P and AP relative equilibria when k5m50. This\nmeans that the energy of the first excited state, which is\napproximately 3A2v above the parallel configuration, must\nbe less than that of the AP relative equilibrium. Since the\nenergy difference between P and AP relative equilibria is\nequal to 2v, we obtain a field strength estimate of v.4.5 for\nquantum monodromy to be observable.\nThe experimental value of v achieved for C2H2 \u2013 HF in\nRef. 9 is 4.82, which is slightly above the critical value.\nHowever much greater values of v have been achieved in a\nnumber of other recent experiments. For example, v524.2\nwas obtained for the near prolate molecule C6H5I in a 20\nkV\/cm electric field,7 and v538 was achieved in a 57\nkV\/cm field for the near oblate molecule pyridazine.8 Fields\nof up to 100 kV\/cm have been reported in orientation\nexperiments.5 However large values of v can also be\nachieved when rotational constants are small. A record value\nof v5365 has been obtained for the linear trimer (HCN)3\nwith a field strength of about 30 kV\/cm because of its ex-\ntremely big dipole moment and very small rotational\nconstant.4 Although the monodromy effect has been demon-\nstrated to exist in the rotation-vibration energy level structure\nof water12 the monodromy point is located too high in energy\nto be experimentally accessible. The Stark field experiments\ngive an occasion where quantum monodromy can be in reach\nof the modern experimental technique.\nE.

Note that the intensity of the\nsimulated spectrum decreases with n due to thermal popula-\ntion.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThis paper has shown how relative equilibria organize\nthe spectrum of a molecule in an electric field and that mono-\ndromy arises naturally in the problem of labelling the quan-\ntum states. The case of symmetric top molecules is particu-\nlarly easy to analyze because it is integrable and so labelling\nis possible by exact quantum numbers. However the effect of\nmonodromy seems quite robust and is likely to be observable\neven in moderately asymmetric molecules using quantum\nnumbers obtained by correlation back to the symmetric case.\nWe have also shown that for symmetric tops Hamil-\ntonian Hopf bifurcations provide a natural boundary to the\nparameter region in which monodromy exists. This phenom-\nenon will also persist for quasisymmetric molecules. More-\nover it seems likely that Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations can\nbe used to demonstrate the existence of monodromy in quan-\ntum states that are localized near relative equilibria even in\nsystems that are globally far from integrable. To see this\nrecall that linearly stable relative equilibria organize regular\nseries of localized quantum states that can be labeled by\nquantum numbers derived from local integrable harmonic\napproximations to the Hamiltonian.33,34 Examples of this in-\nclude pendular states of rigid molecules in electric fields\nwhich are far from the symmetric top or zero field integrable\nlimits. This harmonic approximation can be extended beyond\na Hamiltonian Hopf point at which the relative equilibrium\nloses stability by using a normal form approximation28 which\nis again integrable and so introduces approximate conserved\nquantities and quantum numbers. For example, the normal\nform analysis of the rotating equilateral triangle relative\nequilibrium of H3\n1 ~Ref. 33! near its Hamiltonian Hopf point\nshows that the vibrational angular momentum of the mol-\necule is approximately conserved for the dynamics near the\nrelative equilibrium, though of course it is not globally con-\nserved. Using these approximate quantum numbers it should\nbe possible to construct energy-momentum lattices which\nwill have monodromy after the relative equilibrium has lost\nstability. Qualitatively the \u2018\u2018birth\u2019\u2019 of monodromy in these\ncases will be the same as that demonstrated in Figs. 4 and 5\nnear the point where the AP relative equilibrium detaches\nitself from the curve of Tk relative equilibria. In noninte-\ngrable systems the Tk relative equilibria are themselves re-\nplaced by a family of ~relative! periodic orbits that bifurcates\nfrom the relative equilibrium.28Downloaded 09 Oct 2007 to 131.227.178.135.
