INTRODUCTION\nKohn\u2013Sham density functional theory ~DFT! is widely\nused for electronic structure calculations.1 The accuracy of a\nDFT calculation is governed by the quality of the exchange-\ncorrelation energy functional, and so, the continued develop-\nment of improved approximations to this quantity is essen-\ntial.\nOne approach for developing new functionals is to\nchoose a flexible mathematical form and determine optimal\nparameters by fitting to molecular thermochemical quanti-\nties, such as total energies and atomization energies. This\nsemi-empirical route has been widely used for both con-\ntinuum functionals ~where there is a well-defined exchange-\ncorrelation potential and no integer discontinuity! such as the\ngeneralized gradient approximation ~GGA! and for hybrid\nfunctionals ~which are the sum of a continuum functional\nand a fraction of exact orbital exchange!. Examples of func-\ntionals determined by fitting to thermochemical data include\nthe 1988 exchange GGA functional of Becke2 and the\nB3LYP,3 B97,4 and B97-15 hybrid functionals. Thermo-\nchemical fits have also been used to determine optimal pa-\nrameters in more advanced functional forms.6\nA deficiency of thermochemical fits is that they do not\nexplicitly constrain the Kohn\u2013Sham orbitals and eigenvalues\nto be accurate. To achieve this, the exchange-correlation con-\ntribution to the Kohn\u2013Sham equations must be accurate.\nConsider a general functional, expressed as the sum of a\ncontinuum functional EXC\nj @ra ,rb# and a fraction j of exact\norbital exchange\nEXC@ra ,rb#5EXC\nj @ra ,rb#\n2\nj\n2 E E (s\nurss\n1 ~r,r8!u2\nur2r8u\ndr dr8, ~1!\nwhere the label j in the continuum contribution indicates an\nimplicit dependence on the fraction of orbital exchange,\nwhich in turn is expressed in terms of the Kohn\u2013Sham\ns-spin one-densities\nrss\n1 ~r,r8!5(\ni\nNs\nw is~r!w is~r8!. ~2!\nThis functional represents a conventional continuum func-\ntional such as a GGA when j50, and a typical hybrid func-\ntional when j\u20190.2. The Kohn\u2013Sham equations associated\nwith this functional can be derived by minimizing the elec-\ntronic energy with respect to the Kohn\u2013Sham orbitals. The\ncontinuum contribution EXC\nj @ra ,rb# in Eq. ~1! is an explicit\nfunctional of the electron density and so its contribution to\nthe Kohn\u2013Sham equations is the multiplicative scalar poten-\ntial\nvXC,s\nj ~r!5\ndEXC\nj @ra ,rb#\ndrs~r!\n. ~3!\nJOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS VOLUME 115, NUMBER 20 22 NOVEMBER 2001\n92330021-9606\/2001\/115(20)\/9233\/10\/$18.00 \u00a9 2001 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.65. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nBy contrast, the exact exchange term is a functional of the\nKohn\u2013Sham orbitals, rather than the density, and so its con-\ntribution to the Kohn\u2013Sham equations is non-multiplicative,\ninvolving the electron interchange operator Prr8 and the one-\ndensity ~as in Hartree\u2013Fock theory!. The Kohn\u2013Sham equa-\ntions are written\nS h~r!1vJ~r!1vXC,sj ~r!\n2jE dr8 rss1 ~r,r8!\nur2r8u\nPrr82epsD wps~r!50, ~4!\nwhere h(r) is the sum of the kinetic energy operator and the\nexternal potential and vJ(r) is the Coulomb ~Hartree! poten-\ntial.\nWe note that the Kohn\u2013Sham equations ~4! could be\nformulated in an alternative, more theoretically appealing\nmanner, in terms of a purely multiplicative exchange-\ncorrelation potential. This can be achieved using the opti-\nmized effective potential ~OEP! approach,7 which minimizes\nthe energy with respect to the potential. An alternative route\nis to solve the non-multiplicative equations ~4! for the elec-\ntron density, and then use the constrained search formulation\nto determine the multiplicative potential associated with that\ndensity. We have demonstrated that this latter method, de-\nnoted MKS for \u2018\u2018Multiplicative Kohn\u2013Sham\u2019\u2019 is particularly\nattractive for the calculation of NMR shielding constants.8\nHowever, the OEP and MKS methods are not widely used at\npresent and so, unless otherwise stated, we use the conven-\ntional definition of the Kohn\u2013Sham equations ~4! for the\npresent study. Within this formalism, the quality of the\nKohn\u2013Sham orbitals and eigenvalues is completely gov-\nerned by the quality of the multiplicative potential vXC,s\nj (r)\nfor any j.\nFor GGA functionals, j50 and vXC,s\nj (r) is the conven-\ntional multiplicative exchange-correlation potential. For a\nGGA to give accurate orbitals and eigenvalues it must there-\nfore provide an accurate representation of the exchange-\ncorrelation potential; we have previously attempted to\nachieve this by explicitly introducing potential information\ninto our fitting procedures. Using the method of Zhao, Mor-\nrison, and Parr ~ZMP!,9 exchange-correlation potentials have\nbeen determined from correlated ab initio electron densities\nfor a series of atoms and molecules. The parameters of flex-\nible functional forms have then been optimized such that\nthey yield accurate thermochemistry for the series of mol-\necules, together with exchange-correlation potentials that are\nmaximally parallel to the ZMP potentials. The series of\nHCTH functionals HCTH\/93,5 HCTH\/147,10 and\nHCTH\/40711 were determined in this manner and have been\nsuccessfully applied to molecules resembling those in the\nfitting data. They can be less successful when applied to\nsystems that differ considerably from those in the fitting data,\nsuch as bulk semiconductors involving relatively heavy\natoms.12\nFor a hybrid functional (j\u00de0) to give accurate orbitals\nand eigenvalues, it, too, must provide an accurate represen-\ntation of vXC,s\nj (r). However, in this case vXC,sj (r) is not the\nconventional exchange-correlation potential since part of the\nexchange-correlation contribution to the Kohn\u2013Sham opera-\ntor is now accounted for in the non-multiplicative orbital\nexchange term. The conventional ZMP approach takes no\naccount of orbital exchange and so cannot be used to calcu-\nlate vXC,s\nj (r) from ab initio densities. For this reason, mul-\ntiplicative potential information has not been previously used\nin the development of semi-empirical hybrid functionals.\nIn this study the ZMP approach is generalized such that\nit can be used to calculate vXC,s\nj (r) from ab initio densities\nwhen j\u00de0. By analogy with the GGA case, a new hybrid\nfunctional is then developed by optimizing its parameters\nsuch that it yields accurate thermochemistry for a series of\natoms and molecules and has a continuum contribution\nEXC\nj @ra ,rb# whose potential is maximally parallel to the\nnew ZMP potential for these systems. By comparing its per-\nformance with that of B97-1, which was determined solely\nfrom thermochemical data, the influence of multiplicative\npotential information in hybrid functional development is\nquantified. We also take this opportunity to perform a de-\ntailed comparison between these highly parameterized func-\ntionals and the B3LYP functional, which is widely used in\nchemical applications.\nIn Sec. II, a modified ZMP approach is presented for\ndetermining vXC,s\nj (r) from ab initio densities when j\u00de0.\nThe potentials for j50.21 are presented for Ne, CO, and HF,\nand are compared with the corresponding exchange-\ncorrelation (j50.0) and Hartree\u2013Fock-Kohn\u2013Sham correla-\ntion (j51.0) potentials. In Sec. III, new exchange-\ncorrelation functionals are derived for a range of j values; an\noptimal functional is defined by assessing the performance of\nthe functionals for thermochemistry, molecular structures,\nand six hydrogen abstraction reaction barriers. In Sec. IV, the\nperformance of the new functional is investigated for a range\nof molecular structures, electric and magnetic response prop-\nerties, and sixteen chemical reaction barriers. Conclusions\nare presented in Sec. V.\nII. DETERMINATION OF vXC,sj \u0084r\u0085 FROM THE DENSITY\nThe ZMP approach is now generalized so it can be ap-\nplied to functionals of the general form ~1!.

The addition of both extra\nterms does not affect the minimization since they are explicit\nfunctionals of the spin densities.

The potentials were determined from\nBrueckner Doubles ~BD! electron densities using a TZ2P\nbasis set15 and a Lagrange multiplier l5900. ~The use of a\nfinite Gaussian basis set makes the limit l\u2192\u2018 inappropriate\nand studies have demonstrated that l5900 is acceptable.16!\nFor comparison, the conventional exchange-correlation po-\ntentials @vZMP,s\nj (r) when j50.0# and the correlation poten-\ntial of Hartree\u2013Fock-Kohn\u2013Sham theory @vZMP,s\nj (r) when\nj51.0# are also presented.

A possible shift between the\ntwo potentials must be introduced because the continuum\npart of the new functional gives a potential that does not\nexhibit any integer discontinuity. Following Ref. 18, we de-\nfine a new quantity, which measures the degree to which the\ntwo potentials are parallel\nTABLE I. Fitting data used in functional determination:\n1.

Following Ref. 5, the weights\nin Eq. ~16! are chosen to be vE5750 and vv51. As with\nB97-1, all calculations in the functional development use the\nTZ2P basis set, and so all the functionals determined in this\nstudy are specifically designed for this basis. Unless other-\nwise stated, all calculations use TZ2P.\nA. Dependence on j\nFour new functionals, corresponding to j5 0.19, 0.20,\n0.21, and 0.22, have been determined and implemented in\nthe CADPAC program.19 To choose an optimal functional,\nmolecular structures, thermochemical quantities, and hydro-\ngen abstraction reaction barriers were computed, and com-\npared with experimental or high-level ab initio calculations.\nThis criterion for the optimal functional is arbitrary, other\nproperties could have been considered. However, structures\nand thermochemistry are particularly important, while reac-\ntion barriers are a demanding test of any exchange-\ncorrelation functional. The error assessment is presented in\nTable II.\nTo assess structural accuracy, the mean absolute bond\nlength and bond angle errors are presented for the 40 small\nmolecules of Table IV. These are a subset of the fitting mol-\necules M , where the experimental structures are accurately\nknown. The quality of bond lengths and bond angles is al-\nmost constant over the range of j values considered, and is\nvery close to that of conventional B97-1 and B3LYP.\nMean absolute errors for the total energies ~E! of sys-\ntems A1 and A1\n1 ; ionization potentials ~IP! of systems A2 ;\nand atomization energies ~AE! of systems M are presented.\nAs with the molecular structures, thermochemical accuracy\nvaries little with j. Total energies and ionization potentials\nare slightly less accurate than B97-1, by approximately 1.0\nand 0.4 kcal\/mol, respectively. Atomization energies from\nthe new functionals are close to those from B97-1. The new\nfunctionals and B97-1 are a significant improvement over\nB3LYP.\nFinally, mean absolute errors for six classical reaction\nbarriers are presented. These reactions were studied previ-\nously by Skokov and Wheeler20 and Hamprecht et al.,5 and\ncorrespond to the first six reactions of Table IX. Where more\nthan one ab initio value is presented in Table IX, an average\nvalue is used for the error analysis. Once again, the variation\nwith j is small. Mean absolute errors for the new functionals\nare a notable improvement over B97-1 and B3LYP.\nIt is clear that the variation with j is relatively small and\nthat no single value is optimal for all properties. For the\nremainder of this study, we shall concentrate on the new\nfunctional with j50.21, since this value is used in B97-1.\nWe denote the new functional as B97-2, as it is a natural\nextension of B97-1\u2014the sole difference between the two\nfunctionals is that the former is fitted to thermochemistry and\npotentials, while the latter is fitted to just thermochemistry.\nBy comparing the performance of B97-2 and B97-1, the in-\nfluence of including multiplicative potential information in\nhybrid functional development will be quantified.\nThe parameters defining B97-2 are presented in Table\nIII. The third parameter, the local ab correlation prefactor, is\nparticularly close to unity, demonstrating that the uniform\ngas ab correlation limit is approximately satisfied. The cor-\nresponding prefactor for the B97-1 functional is 0.955 689.\nIV. PERFORMANCE OF B97-2\nIn this section a detailed assessment of B97-2 is pre-\nsented for the prediction of molecular structures, electric and\nmagnetic response properties, together with a more extensive\nrange of classical reaction barriers.\nA. Molecular structures\nIn Table IV optimized structures for the 40 small mol-\necules are presented. The quality of the nuclear derivative\n~and hence the molecular structure! is governed, for a given\nbasis set, by the quality of vXC,s\nj (r). Despite being deter-\nmined from ab initio potentials, B97-2 offers minimal im-\nprovement over B97-1. Geometries from B3LYP are also of\ncomparable accuracy.\nIn Table V, optimized bond lengths are presented for a\nseries of diatomic radicals, which are absent from the fitting\ndata. On average, the B97-2 bond lengths are now an im-\nprovement over B97-1, which in turn is a slight improvement\nover B3LYP.\nIn Table VI, the structures of FOOF, FNO2 ~C2v,! O3,\nFO2, Cr~CO!6 and Ni~CO!4 are presented. The TZ2P basis\nset is used for the first-row atoms; a ~14s13p6d!\/@8s7p4d#\ncontraction, obtained by augmenting the basis set of\nWachters,34 is used for the transition metals. In FOOF,\nFNO2, and O3, B97-2 bond lengths are uniformly shorter\nTABLE III. Functional parameters defining B97-2.

For all but the OO bond length in\nFOOF, this leads to an increased error. The FO and OO bond\nlengths in FOOF and O3, respectively, are particularly poor\nwith both hybrid functionals.

For the two transition metal complexes, simi-\nlar quality is obtained with B97-1 and B97-2, while B3LYP\nis less accurate for the metal ligand distances.\nB. Static isotropic polarizabilities\nIn Table VII, static isotropic polarizabilities are pre-\nsented for a series of small molecules. All calculations were\nperformed at near-experimental geometries,21,37 using the Sa-\ndlej basis set.38 The B3LYP, B97-1, and B97-2 polarizabil-\nities do not include zero-point vibrational corrections\n~ZPVC\u2019s!, and so are not strictly comparable with the experi-\nmental values. For several of the molecules in Table VII,\nRussell and Spackman39 have calculated ZPVC\u2019s, and find\nthat in all cases the correction increases the calculated polar-\nizability by a non-negligible amount. An accurate non-\ncorrected DFT calculation should therefore underestimate the\npolarizabilities of these systems. To provide a more valid\ncomparison we also present BD~T! polarizabilities, which\nneglect ZPVC\u2019s; these were determined as the numerical\n~finite-difference! derivative of the BD~T! electric dipole\nmoment, using a static electric field of magnitude 0.001 au.\nIn moving from B3LYP to B97-1 to B97-2, there is a\nuniform reduction in the static isotropic polarizabilities, lead-\ning to improved agreement with the reference BD~T! values.\nThe mean errors, relative to BD~T!, reduce from 0.36 to 0.18\nto 20.04 au for B3LYP, B97-1, and B97-2, respectively. The\ncorresponding mean absolute errors reduce from 0.44 to 0.32\nto 0.22 au.\nBoth B97-2 and BD~T! underestimate experimental po-\nlarizabilities by an average of 0.13 and 0.10 au, respectively,\nwhich is consistent with the neglect of ZPVC\u2019s. By contrast,\nB3LYP and B97-1 overestimate the experimental values by\nan average of 0.26 and 0.09 au, respectively, and so their\nerrors will increase upon addition of a positive ZPVC.\nTo assess the frequency dependence of the polarizability,\nvertical valence excitation energies were determined for N2,\nCO, H2CO, C2H4, and C6H6 with appropriate basis sets. Va-\nlence excitations from B97-1 and B97-2 were very similar,\nand so the results are not explicitly presented. B97-2 excita-\ntions were equal to or slightly larger ~by less than 0.1 eV!\nthan those of B97-1. This led to a slight improvement for\nN2 , CO, and C2H4, where valence excitations are underesti-\nmated with B97-1. It slightly reduces the accuracy for H2CO\nand C6H6, where B97-1 overestimates some of the excitation\nenergies.\nC. Isotropic NMR shielding constants\nIn Table VIII, isotropic NMR shielding constants are\npresented for a series of small first- and second-row mol-\necules. All calculations were performed at the near-\nexperimental geometries discussed in Ref. 8, using the Huzi-\nnaga ~IGLO IV! basis set.44,49 The errors are dominated by\nthe ozone molecule and so errors are also presented when\nozone is omitted. The columns headed B3LYP, B97-1 and\nB97-2 are conventional shielding constants ~the second de-\nrivatives of the corresponding electronic energies! deter-\nmined in a coupled fashion. Shieldings are very poor for all\nthree functionals, although there is a notable improvement\nfrom B3LYP to B97-1 to B97-2.\nIn a recent study8 we introduced a new approach for\ndetermining NMR shielding constants directly from theoret-\nical electron densities. In the new approach, denoted MKS\n~for Multiplicative Kohn\u2013Sham!, a fully multiplicative\nexchange-correlation potential is determined from a theoret-\nical electron density using the conventional (j50) ZMP ap-\nproach. The Kohn\u2013Sham orbitals and eigenvalues associated\nwith this potential are then input into the conventional un-\ncoupled Kohn\u2013Sham shielding expression; for full details of\nthe MKS approach, see Ref. 8. The MKS~B3LYP!,\nMKS~B97-1!, and MKS~B97-2! values in Table VIII are\nshieldings determined from B3LYP, B97-1, and B97-2 elec-\ntron densities, respectively, using the same combination of\nTZ2P and Huzinaga ~IGLO IV! basis sets used in Ref. 8. The\nresults are two to three times more accurate than the respec-\ntive shieldings determined in the conventional manner.\nAgain, there is an improvement in quality from\nMKS~B3LYP! to MKS~B97-1! to MKS~B97-2!. When all the\nmolecules are considered, the B97-2 mean absolute error is\n15.8 ppm, compared to the best ab initio error of 11.2 ppm.\nD. Classical reaction barriers\nThe accurate calculation of chemical reaction barriers is\na considerable challenge for Kohn\u2013Sham theory. For many\nreactions, barriers from conventional GGA and hybrid func-\ntionals lie significantly below those from high-level ab initio\ncorrelated methods ~e.g., see Refs. 20, 50, 51!, although the\nerrors can be reduced by significantly increasing the fraction\nof orbital exchange ~e.g., see Ref. 52! In Table IX, classical\nreaction barriers ~i.e., no zero-point, thermal, or tunnelling\ncontributions! are presented for sixteen simple reactions. The\nfirst column indicates the reactants. The second column de-\nscribes the nature of the transition state, in each case the\nTABLE VII.

For all\nbut the final reaction, a transition state was verified by the\npresence of a single imaginary harmonic vibrational fre-\nquency with all three functionals. For the final reaction ~con-\nstrained to D\u2018h symmetry! the energy surface for the bending\nmotion was found to be very flat with all three functionals. In\nmoving from B3LYP to B97-1 to B97-2, there was an in-\ncreased tendency towards a slightly non-linear transition\nstate with this basis set. For reference, the final column pre-\nsents classical barriers determined using high-level ab initio\nmethods. For the reactions where more than one ab initio\nresult is presented, the average value is used in the error\nanalysis.\nAlthough B3LYP provides a more accurate average de-\nscription than B97-1 for the first six reactions, when all six-\nteen reactions are considered B97-1 is on average the more\naccurate functional. Both B3LYP and B97-1 consistently un-\nderestimate the reaction barriers, with mean absolute errors\nof 5.0 and 3.6 kcal\/mol, respectively. For the reaction\nH1NO, B3LYP fails to predict a barrier; this is remedied\nTABLE VIII.

The mean and mean absolute B97-2\nerrors of 21.8 and 2.4 kcal\/mol, respectively, are a signifi-\ncant improvement over both B3LYP and B97-1. However,\nsignificant errors remain, most notably for the reactions\nH21OH, CH41OH, and O1HCl. We note that our DFT\ncalculations do not include a BSSE counterpoise correction.\nSuch a correction would further increase the DFT barriers,\nalthough a previous study suggests that the correction is\nsmall for the TZ2P basis set.67\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe procedure of Zhao, Morrison, and Parr,9 which de-\ntermines multiplicative Kohn\u2013Sham potentials from theoret-\nical electron densities, has been generalized to account for a\nfraction of exact orbital exchange. Multiplicative potentials,\nappropriate for adding to 0.21 times the non-multiplicative\norbital exchange term in the Kohn\u2013Sham equations, have\nbeen examined graphically for Ne, HF, and CO. They show\nsimilar structural characteristics to the full exchange-\ncorrelation potential. By fitting to thermochemical data and\nZMP potentials, a new hybrid exchange-correlation func-\ntional, B97-2, has been determined. ~The source code for\nimplementation of this functional is available from\nD.J.Tozer@durham.ac.uk.! For the systems investigated, the\nperformance of B97-2 relative to B97-1 and B3LYP can be\nsummarized as follows:\n~a! B97-2 atomization energies are comparable to those\nfrom B97-1, while total energies and ionization potentials are\nslightly less accurate. This reduction in accuracy is unsur-\nprising, given that the emphasis in the fit has been shifted\nfrom pure thermochemistry to both thermochemistry and po-\ntentials. B97-2 and B97-1 are a significant improvement over\nB3LYP in these thermochemical studies;\n~b! B97-2, B97-1 and B3LYP exhibit similar overall ac-\ncuracy for molecular structures;\n~c! Relative to BD~T!, static isotropic polarizabilities im-\nprove from B3LYP to B97-1 to B97-2; the latter functional\ngives polarizabilities that are on average below experimental\nvalues, which is consistent with the neglect of vibrational\ncorrections;\n~d! Shielding constants determined using two different\napproaches improve from B3LYP to B97-1 to B97-2. The\nshieldings determined directly from the DFT densities using\nthe MKS approach are two to three times more accurate than\nconventional shieldings, determined as the second derivative\nof the electronic energy; and\n~e! Classical reaction barriers improve significantly from\nB3LYP to B97-1 to B97-2.\nOverall, the results suggest that introducing multiplica-\ntive potentials into semi-empirical functional development is\nbeneficial. Further assessment of the performance of B97-2\nis now required.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nFinancial support from the EPSRC is gratefully ac-\nknowledged.\nTABLE IX.
