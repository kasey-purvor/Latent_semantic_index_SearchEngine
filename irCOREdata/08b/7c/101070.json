This interest\nis mainly due to the many and varied potential applications\nfor CNTs including low threshold field emitters3,4 for display\ntechnologies, nano-scale circuitry5 and hydrogen storage.6\nCNTs have been grown by a variety of different methods\nincluding laser ablation,7 arc discharge8 and more recently,\nthermal- and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition\n~PECVD!.9,10 There has been significant effort focused on\nunderstanding the growth mechanisms of CNTs, including\nthe study of how the size and structure of the catalyst par-\nticles ~typically Ni, Fe, or Co! affect the growth.9\u201313 Many\ndifferent techniques are used for the preparation of suitable\nsubstrates.12,14,15 To date the formation of suitable catalyst\nsubstrates for CNT growth is accomplished by thermal an-\nnealing of thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering12 or\nthermal evaporation.13 The latter study involving nanostruc-\nturing of Ni on oxide films at temperatures below 500 \u00b0C. In\nthis letter we introduce a method of producing discrete cata-\nlyst particles using a combination of pulsed laser ablation\n~PLA!16 and laser nanostructuring ~LN!. By controlling the\nlaser parameters, such as number of pulses and fluence, we\nare readily able to control the morphology of the nanostruc-\ntured Ni films within one process technology. Since only the\nsurface region is exposed to high ~local! temperatures during\nnanostructuring, the macroscopic temperature is not raised\nsignificantly, thereby allowing the use of plastic or organic\nsubstrates.17 This is clearly is more advantageous than re-\nquiring one growth method ~magnetron sputtering or thermal\nevaporation! followed by conventional high temperature an-\nnealing.\nNi thin films were deposited by PLA of a 99.9% pure Ni\ntarget. A Lambda-Physik LPX 200 excimer laser operating at\n248 nm was used for the ablation. The growth chamber was\nevacuated using a turbo pump to 931028 Torr. The sub-\nstrates used were SiO2 \/Si with different values of oxide\nthickness 235 and 320 nm of thermal oxide and one with\nonly the native oxide coating. The target to substrate distance\nwas 6 cm for all depositions. Thin films were grown using\n10, 50, 200, 750, 1000, 1500, and 2000 laser shots at laser\npulse energy of 100 mJ, focused onto a rotating target, pro-\nducing a fluence of ;10 J cm22. The initial growth, final\nsmoothness and thickness of the Ni films were investigated\nin ambient using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIa\natomic force microscope ~AFM! operating in tapping mode.\nThe thin films were LN using the same excimer laser as\nemployed for the deposition, by diverting the optical path\nand passing it through a homogenizer. The films were trans-\nferred to a separate vacuum stage ~typical working pressure\n1024 Torr) where the whole sample could be nanostructured\nby translating the stage. Typical translation rate was 1 mm\/s\nwith a laser repetition rate of 10 Hz. Postexposure the struc-\nture of the films was investigated in a Hitachi S4000 field\nemission gun scanning electron microscope ~SEM!.\nThe initial stages of growth of the Ni films were inves-\ntigated in the AFM by depositing Ni onto the 320 nm\nSiO2 \/Si substrates. After ten laser shots at a fluence of\n10 J\/cm2 the Ni had not formed a continuous film, but con-\nsisted of islands. After around 200 shots the islands had coa-\nlesced and by 1000 shots a smooth film with a root mean\nsquare roughness of ,1 nm was produced. By masking a\nsection of the substrate prior to deposition, it was possible to\nmeasure the Ni film thickness by scanning the AFM over the\nstep produced. Seven hundred and fifty laser shots produced\na film 6.560.9-nm-thick and 1500 shots resulted in a thick-\nness of 8.260.9 nm. The predicted offset for zero laser shots\nis a consequence of the initial island growth.\nAfter growth the films with 750, 1000, 1500, and 2000\na!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\ns.henley@eim.surrey.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS VOLUME 84, NUMBER 20 17 MAY 2004\n40350003-6951\/2004\/84(20)\/4035\/3\/$22.00 \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Figure 1 shows SEM\nimages of a selection of the LN films, with different initial Ni\nthicknesses, grown on 320 nm SiO2 \/Si substrates. After\nnanostructuring, the Ni film was observed to break up into\ndiscrete nanometer-scale hemispherical islands. The fluence\nrequired to achieve this breakup appeared to be a function of\nthe initial film thickness and the thickness of the oxide layer\non the substrate. At lower fluences the films were observed to\nperforate, but the break up into discrete droplets was incom-\nplete. Above ;280 mJ\/cm2 significant ablation of the Ni was\nobserved. At intermediate fluences the Ni island size was\nunaffected by the laser fluence and the substrates used. The\nfluence required to nanostructure the films grown on the thin-\nner ~235 nm! thermal SiO2 substrates was higher than for the\ncorresponding Ni film on the thicker SiO2 layers. On the Si\nsubstrates with only the native oxide layer, no nanostructur-\ning was observed, as it appeared that the fluence required\nwas higher than the ablation threshold of the film. This is\nmost likely due to the higher thermal conductivity of Si\n(150 W m21 K21 at 25 \u00b0C) in comparison to that of SiO2\n(1.34 W m21 K21).18 Figure 1~a! shows a 6.5-nm-thick film\nLN at 200 mJ\/cm2, ~b! a 8.2-nm-thick film LN at\n160 mJ\/cm2, ~c! a 11.5-nm-thick film LN at 140 mJ\/cm2 and\n~d! a 15-nm-thick film LN at 220 mJ\/cm2. It should be noted\nthat the image in Fig. 1~d! is taken at a lower magnification\nthan the others.\nThe size distribution of the Ni droplets produced was\nobtained using commercial image analysis software.19 Figure\n2 shows the histograms of the Ni droplet size distributions\nfrom the films in Fig. 1. Note the statistics were improved, in\nsome cases, by analyzing multiple images from different re-\ngions on the same film. No difference was observed, how-\never, between different regions on the same film. The distri-\nbution of Ni droplets for the 6.5-nm-thick film is a good fit to\na log normal distribution peaking at a nickel droplets size of\n55 nm. The size distributions for the other values of Ni thick-\nness appear bi modal. By examining Fig. 1~d! the origin of\nthese bimodal distributions can be suggested. In this figure,\nand to a lesser extent in Fig. 1~c!, smaller droplets are seen to\nlie in lines extending between the larger droplets. At fluences\nlower than those which cause complete breakup of the films,\nperforation of the films is observed. The molten film around\nthese perforations is observed to have drawn away from the\ncenter of the hole. When the density of perforations is high\nthe retreating molten film between two holes can coalesce\ninto filaments. The final structure becomes an array of large\ndroplets connected by a web of filaments. At slightly higher\nfluences these filaments will have enough energy to divide\ninto smaller droplets, as is observed. Figure 2~e! shows a plot\nof the mean diameter of the Ni droplets as a function of\ninitial film thickness. It can be observed that the mean drop-\nlet size increases as the initial film thickness increases, which\nis consistent with the thermal annealing data, of Ni thin\nfilms, by Chhowalla et al.12 at 700 \u00b0C. Thus, choosing an\nappropriate film thickness can be used to control the size\ndistribution of the nickel islands.\nA selection of the processed films was used as substrates\nfor the growth of CNTs by PECVD. The growth conditions\nused were a substrate temperature of 700 \u00b0C, a pressure of\n10 Torr ~5% acetylene, remainder nitrogen! and a growth\ntime of 10 min at a bias of 2450 V. Figure 3 shows a cross-\nsectional SEM image of one of these samples after growth\non the thinner of the two thermal oxide substrates. From Fig.\n3 it is observed that the CNTs produced are split into two\ngroups. One group is significantly longer and wider than the\nother, with diameters approximately the same as the Ni drop-\nlet size that was on the processed film, as has been observed\nelsewhere.14 The Ni droplets can be observed at the end of\nthese tubes, as black dots in the SEM image. The CNTs in\nthe second set appear as an \u2018\u2018undergrowth\u2019\u2019 and are much\nshorter with smaller diameters than the first set. No Ni drop-\nlets were observed at the top of these CNTs but this may just\nbe a consequence of the limited spatial resolution of the\nSEM, compared to the size of these tubes.

Smaller Ni droplets can be seen\ncovering the areas between the larger droplets. In this case\nthe droplets are approximately 10 nm high. It is suggested\nthat this second set of CNTs grow from these smaller catalyst\nparticles. The separation between the larger CNTs is greater\nthan is typically observed for CNTs grown on thermally an-\nnealed Ni catalyst films. This would make this technique\nuseful for the preparation of field emission displays, as the\nCNTs would be subject to less field screening from surround-\ning tubes.20\nIn conclusion, it has been shown that the combination of\nexcimer laser growth and nanostructuring of thin metal films\nis a useful method for the preparation of large area substrates\nfor CNT growth with well-defined, discrete, nano-scale cata-\nlyst particles. These substrates are prepared without any\nmacroscopic heating of the substrate and have particle sepa-\nrations more suitable for the production of field emission\ncathodes.\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio\nGrant and the CBE Program for funding the project.\n1 S.
