Paperback, 160 pages, \u00a315.99.\nTraining in information technology (IT) is\nbecoming a crucial activity for virtually all\norganizations - a well-worn cliche. Sadly,\nhowever, it is all too often the case that training\nbudgets are manipulated and absorbed into\nother 'worthy' causes. The result is that IT\ntraining is hastily passed onto junior members of\na team or to postgraduate students who have\nhad little formal training and experience of IT\ntraining. It is for these novice trainers that the\n'500 computer tips' will be particularly useful\nbut it is also a highly worthwhile, accessible\nreference for more experienced trainers in both\nacademic and non-academic environments. This\nbook (one of a series of '500 Tips' from Kogan\nPage) does not aim to give technical information\nabout any particular software package but\nprovides readable, understandable generic tips\nwhich have a sound pedagogical base (although\nthis is carefully hidden).\nThe introduction, six chapters and conclusion\nare written in a clear, concise style with very\nlimited use of jargon and could be read straight\nthrough but would probably be more useful as a\nguide to delve into as appropriate. The chapters\nare logically organized; each has an intro-\nduction, followed by several sections of carefully\nexplained relevant, related tips (this helps\nscanning and navigation of the book for the\n'time-poor' trainer). Each tip is typed in bold\nand followed by several illustrative sentences.\nFor example, the following tip is taken from the\nspreadsheet chapter: 'Show trainees where their\nlost data has gone. In the early stage of\nspreadsheet use, a common difficulty is\ndisappearing data. . .\"\nThe first and longest chapter introduces a wide\nrange of areas that are vital for successful\ntraining with IT. Initially, the tips address\nreasons for using computers in training, and\nmotivating students to use computers for\ntraining and learning outcomes - these tips are\nvery relevant for novice trainers and are fre-\nquently overlooked. They provide a superficial\nbut useful introduction and explore themes, for\nexample, the use of 'hands-on' training, which\nare referred to throughout the book. One\nobvious but often forgotten example: 'Remind\nyour trainees that computers don't care about\nmistakes. They may give error messages... but\na computer does not get angry . . . ' Some of the\nsubsequent sections in this chapter address the\nselection of appropriate training materials.\nThese sections provide an excellent checklist that\nwould be found useful by both novices and\nexperienced trainers. The last section explores\nmethods for encouraging trainees to work\ntogether - this is often difficult to organize in\nmost training environments but this book\nprovides some workable ideas.\nThe second compact chapter has some excellent\ntips on using computers for presentations. These\ntips consider the appropriateness of presentation\npackages for training and discuss how they can\nbe used as a valuable teaching tool (as opposed\n103\nReviews\nto a technical gimmick) and provide some\ninnovative suggestions on using the software. A\nuseful tip from this section, and one that is all\ntoo frequently forgotten is: 'Don't leave a slide\non when you've moved on to talk about\nsomething else.'\nThe third chapter provides tips for training in\nword-processing, spreadsheets, databases and\nprogramming. Although the first two sections\noffer some very pragmatic tips (especially the\nspreadsheet ones) it was perhaps a little\noptimistic for the authors to cover programming\nin this section. For experienced trainers, there\nare a few surprising ideas.\nRare in a training book, the fourth chapter\naddresses how to 'look after' the trainer. It\nprovides a set of sensible tips about organization\nprior to the training session and extremely astute\nhelp on how to cope with stressful training\nscenarios including a powercut (I wonder if the\nauthors had personal experience of such night-\nmare scenes). One tip in this section, which is\ninvaluable, is: 'Don't blame the technology but\nconcentrate on dealing with the situation.' In\naddition there are twenty tips for coping with\ntechnophobes and technophiles and some very\nsuccinct ones for the peripatetic trainer in\nstrange climes from a technical perspective\n(gadgets, leads and grommets) to the personal\n('look after your temperature')!\nRather ambitiously, Chapter 5 addresses such\nissues as: email; feedback using email and\ncomputer conferencing; and computer con-\nferencing and the Internet. Each of these areas\nreally warrants an entire chapter; hence the\ntwenty-three tips alone on effective use of email\n(which would probably be useful for any email\nuser). Nevertheless, there are some very\nstimulating suggestions and each section of tips\nprovides an adequate taster for a novice trainer.\nThe last three sections consider training and the\nInternet; again, there are some sensible tips that\nwould provide a handy introduction to the\nsubject. References (including Web addresses)\nfor further reading and development would have\nbeen most appropriate for all these sections.\nThe last chapter reviews the role of computer-\ndelivered assessment and evaluation. Initially\nsceptical of the practical use of 'tips' in such\ncomplex subject areas, these sixty tips do\nprovide useful insights and a launch point for\nnovice trainers. McDowell and Race give excel-\nlent advice on how to devise computer-delivered\ntests and have some novel suggestions for\n104\ncomputer-generated feedback. However, the\nsection on computer-mediated coursework\nseemed slightly ambitious. Throughout the book\nthere are tips on and about feedback - especially\nin Chapter 5; perhaps it would have been more\nappropriate if the authors had expanded the\nsection on feedback rather than trying to cover\nso much in one chapter. The final two sections\nprovide tips and a list of printed references on\ncomputing and training: manuals for specific\nsoftware predominate. Ideally there should have\nbeen far more pointers to enable novice trainers\nto explore the pedagogical theory of training,\nneeds analysis, etc., and to provide contacts with\nprofessional training bodies.\nOverall, this book pleasantly surprised me. It\naims to provide 500 practical tips for the novice\ntrainer in a readily understandable format -\nwhich it does - especially in the first four\nchapters. Moreover, there are some innovative\ntips that experienced trainers might find useful\nand stimulating, particularly in the last two\nchapters. In addition, because of the generic\nnature of the tips the book should at least\nsurvive a few updates to Microsoft Office]\nSusi Peacock, The American International\nUniversity in London\nP. Honeywill, Visual Language for the World\nWide Web, Exeter: Intellect Books, 1999. ISBN:\n1-871516-96-X. Paperback, 192 pages, \u00a314.95.\nThe use of the Internet and the World Wide\nWeb within education is growing at a\ntremendous pace within all levels and areas of\nthe curriculum. To a large extent this rapid and\nwidespread growth of the Web has been brought\nabout by the availability of 'easy-to-use' Web\ndevelopment tools. This ease of use has\ninvariably come about as a consequence of the\npowerful graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and\nthe rich metaphors that are embedded within the\nmain authoring tools that are now in common\nuse. An important aspect of virtually all parts of\nGUIs is the nature of the icons that they use and\nthe visual communication primitives that they\nembed. Basically, this is the area with which this\nbook deals. It explores, to some extent, the\nhistory of visual communication and its impact\non modern-day techniques of graphical com-\nmunication with computers.\nThe book itself originates from some Ph.D.\nstudies that the author undertook while he was a\nmember of staff in the Faculty of Arts and\nEducation at the University of Plymouth.\nALT-] Volume 8 Number I\nAccording to the author the purpose of the book\n'is to speculate on the developmental route of\nvisual computer languages and how computer\nusers comprehend interfaces' (p. 8). The text is\norganized into six chapters and a bibliography.\nIt starts off with a sort of historical perspective.\nThe first chapter (which is entitled 'Learning\nfrom the Past to Inform the Present . . .')\nexplores the Mayan visual writing system and\nhow hieroglyphs work as a means of representa-\ntion. A number of comparisons are made\nbetween hieroglyphs and computer icons. An\nimportant question posed by the author in this\nchapter, which in a way sets the scene for the\nremainder of the book* is: 'Can the development\nof computer iconography as visual language aid\ncommunication across trans-national language\nand cultural barriers and, if so, where should\nthis begin?' (p.14).\nThe above question is partly answered in\nChapter 2, the title of which is 'Simple Words\nand Visual Metaphors'. The main issue\ndiscussed in this chapter relates to how words\nand icons can be combined to form 'compound\nicons'. Examples are given from many different\nsources - such as Otto Neurath's Isotype system,\nstandard ISC7IEC symbols and various software\ntools such as Adobe Photoshop. In Chapter 3 the\nauthor turns his attention to 'Designing Icons\nfor the Graphical User Interface'. In particular,\nthe chapter 'explores what design rules carry\nover from established graphic design principles'\nto the computer context. Some of the important\ntopics discussed in this chapter include: visual\nreading order (when decoding a message);\nconflict, contrast and harmony (within\ncomputer icons); the use of 'white' space; and\ntypography in icons.\nIn Chapter 4 the author discusses compound\nicons and their families. His treatment of this\ntopic starts off with a discussion of corporate\nidentity (on the Web) and the consistent use of\nsymbols to project a company image - and 'the\nmood of their website' (p. 85). Two design case\nstudies are then presented. These relate to\nconsultancy projects that the author has recently\nbeen involved in. The case studies illustrate the\ndetailed steps involved in creating corporate\nlogos (primarily for use on printed stationery)\nusing a computer-based design system (Adobe\nPhotoshop). These in-depth examples serve to\nreflect the complex issues involved in designing\ngraphical symbols for use both on paper and\nwithin electronic webs. The final part of this\nchapter discusses the possibility of creating a\nfamily of icons by grouping together\nappropriate combinations of graphical\nprimitives chosen from a relevant base set -\nanalogous to the way in which Aichers' 'body\nalphabet' was used to create a family of graphic\nsymbols for use in the Olympic Games.\nChapter 5 deals with representative and abstract\nicons. It starts off with a discussion of'the ABCs\nof Graphic Symbols' and how they can be put\ntogether in various ways to build larger units of\nmeaning. Examples are given from several\nsources such as the Bliss symbols and 'Elephants\nMemory'. The final part of the chapter discusses\nthe 'ARC Interface' and its evaluation. ARC is\nan acronym for 'Arts Research into Com-\nmunication'; this was a project that was\nintended 'to evaluate the convergence of tech-\nnology between computers and communication\nand the natural development of computer\ncompound icons' (p. 126). The evaluation study\ninvolved the use of a user-tracking system that\nautomatically logged mouse movement and the\ntimes spent at particular parts of the screen. The\nresults from the logs could be analysed and\ninterpreted in terms of the elements that made\nup a particular screen of information. In his\nconclusion to this chapter the author re-\ncommends that 'computer compound icons that\nnavigate should represent what they mean, and\ngive further explanation to confirm their\nmeaning when selected through a dynamic\nbehaviour' (p. 134).\nThe final chapter of the book is by far the largest\nand deals with the theme of 'Navigating\nInterfaces'. A wide range of topics is covered. It\nstarts off with a discussion of 'user goals and\nsub-goals' and illustrates the use of icons for\nnavigating through a software product's\nfunctionality (the example used is Microsoft\nWord). An example is then given of how icons\ncan be used to facilitate navigation through a\nmagazine. One of the most interesting parts of\nthis chapter is the one that outlines the use of\n'real-world metaphors' to aid navigation.\nSeveral examples are given to illustrate this\ntechnique, for example, eWorld, Lloyds TSB\nand Singapore's International Airport. A sub-\nstantial part of this chapter is devoted to an\nexamination of 'icons from around the world'.\nThe author examines the icons used by 192\nselected information service providers (taken\nfrom six different continents) in order to see how\nicons appear in their different Web sites.\n105\nReviews\nOverall, I found this an interesting book which I\nenjoyed reading. However, in some ways I was\ndisappointed when I had finished it because I\nthought that it left a number of questions\nunanswered. Primarily, these relate to: (i) icon\ndesign (how do you design a really good icon?);\n(ii) the use of visual language primitives (how\ncan icons be combined in ways that create more\nmeaningful messages?); and, (iii) what exactly\nhappens when a user is exposed to an icon (set)\nwithin a graphical user interface - that is, what\nmental processes are stimulated? In my view\nthese are important topics. Perhaps they may\nform the basis for a future book?\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nJ. D. M. Underwood and J. R. Hartley (eds.),\nComputer Assisted Learning \u2014 Selected Contribu-\ntions from CAL97, Exeter: Pergamon, 1998.\nISBN: 0-08-043435-5. Paperback, 140 pages. $85\nUS.\nThis special edition of the respected inter-\nnational journal Computers in Education\ncontains seventeen papers from the CAL97\nsymposium. This event was held at my own\ninstitution so I must confess to a certain\nexpectation when I received the slim volume.\nThe symposium theme 'Superhighways,\nSuperCAL, Super Learning?' was intended to\nsuggest the tension between the expanding\napplication of ICT for teaching and its\nquestionable value for learners. Unfortunately\nthe title did little for me at the time and, while\nthe topic is certainly addressed explicitly in some\nof the papers and implicitly by the whole\nvolume, the CAL97 theme only hints at the\nexcellent range and content of the work\npresented.\nSymposium volumes are hard to compile and\ncan be really hard to edit into shape (speaking as\nan ex-journal editor) so it is rewarding to find a\nreasonably coherent collection of papers ranging\nfrom empirical research to (what amount to)\nproject reports and critical reviews. The papers\nare of varying length and depth but none are\noutrageously long or frustratingly short.\nThe pure research papers are out-numbered by\nreports of projects and activities using ICT\n(principally CAL in these papers) in teaching\nand learning. This situation accurately reflects\nthe severe lack of hard research data in the field.\nThis is an issue that appears consistently\nthroughout the papers and is highlighted in the\nPreface.\n106\nThe Preface does its job by giving a good\nintroduction to the changing themes in each\npaper whilst pointing out common strands\nwhich have sometimes resulted in natural group-\nings of papers. This goes some way to explaining\nthe diversity of the contents and helped me make\nmy own cross-references in contextually\ndifferent papers. For example, the niche role of\nICT is succinctly discussed in the first paper\n('Niche based success in CAL') and neatly\nillustrated in two empirical studies later on\n('Exploring children's responses to interpersonal\nconflict using bubble-dialogue in a mainstream\nand an EBD school' and 'Talking book design:\nwhat do practitioners want?'). Cross-referencing\nlike this is something a reader might not expect\nto be doing with a set of conference papers but I\nfound myself becoming quite immersed in the\npedagogical and practical issues raised by this\ncollection of work.\nAlthough Computers in Education is an inter-\nnational journal the CAL97 edition is\ndominated by UK work, with pure research\nfocused on primary\/tertiary levels and virtually\nall other papers on tertiary education (either\nwork for tertiary learners or work carried out at\nthis level). There are some interesting reports of\ncollaborative, international work (e.g. the T3\nconsortium and the European FETICHE\nproject) and contributions from the USA and\nFinland. The latter serve to remind us that\nlearners and educators encounter the same\nissues wherever they are based. A scan through\nthe References section on each paper reveals\nsome excellent sources, including many of the\nestablished journals in the field and, notably, a\nnumber of Web-based sources and sites.\nThere are five papers that examine and\/or\nevaluate the use of specific software packages\nfor learning. These range from 'Niche-based\nsuccess in CAL' which takes a broad look at\ndifferent applications of CAL packages, to the\nsharp focus of 'Microwave Workshop for\nWindows' which describes the practical applica-\ntion of one piece of software to support learning.\nThere are also useful comparative studies, for\nexample, 'Active, collaborative and case-based\nlearning with computer-based case scenarios'.\nFurther papers cover the development of\nsystems for the integration and\/or delivery of\nCBL\/CAL. These include 'Beyond the media:\nknowledge level interaction and guided\nintegration for CBL systems' which focuses on\nthe use of a range of materials under the G-PIL\nsystem, and 'Building and testing a virtual\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nuniversity' which is a highly readable account of\nthe development of a large ICT-based learning\ndelivery system.\nThe other papers represent a cross-section of\naccounts that examine how ICT has been used in\nschools and in other scenarios for the improve-\nment and development of communication and\ninteraction in a learning environment. Diverse\ntitles include \"The Cyber-Olympics - schools,\nsports and the superhighway', 'A career service\non the Internet' and 'An evaluation of the use of\ncomputer supported peer review for developing\nhigher level skills'. The volume ends with some\nuseful book reviews.\nAs a report of CAL97 this volume accurately\nrepresents the enormous diversity of\npresentations as well as the undoubted\nscholarship and obvious commitment and\nenthusiasm of the presenters. If a weakness\nneeds to be identified it would be that the\nsubjects covered are also being addressed at the\nsame level in a number of other, excellent\njournals (ALT-J for one) but in a more timely\nfashion. By the time you read this review the\nCAL97 papers will be nearly three years old.\nHowever, despite a continued explosion in the\npenetration of the Internet into our daily lives\nand big changes in consumer communications\ntechnology and usage, the work presented here\nis probably still pretty much state-of-play for the\neducation world, at least in the UK and\nprobably much of Europe.\nTo conclude, I found this collection of papers\nremarkably good reading, still very relevant, and\nthought-provoking. Not all the papers will be of\ninterest to everyone working in this field but\nthere is bound to be something of interest,\nsomething new and something you ought to\nknow about. At least for the next three years!\nClive Betts, University of Exeter\nNote: The papers contained in this book were\nsimultaneously published as Volume 30 (1\/2) in\nthe journal Computers and Education.\nJohn Holford, Peter Jarvis and Collin Griffin\n(eds.), International Perspectives on Lifelong\nLearning, London: Kogan Page, 1998. ISBN: 0-\n7494-2869-4. xvi+368 pages. \u00a345.00.\nThe book can truly claim the word 'inter-\nnational' used in its title with contributions from\nall around the world of lifelong learning from\nCanada, USA, UK, Finland, Netherlands,\nBelgium, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, China,\nJapan, Australia and Tasmania to New Zealand.\nIts multiple perspectives were originally\npresented as papers at the conference 'Lifelong\nLearning: Rhetoric, Reality and Public Policy'\nin July 1997 at the University of Surrey.\nThe book is presented in seven parts: Inter-\nnational Policy (Part I); Lifelong Learning in the\nLearning Society (Part II); Lifelong Learning\nand Political Transitions (Part III); Learning,\nMarkets and Change in Welfare States (Part\nIV); Learning and Change in Educational\nStructures (Part V); Learning and Change in\nWork (Part VI); Aims, Ethics and Social\nPurpose in Lifelong Learning (Part VII). It is a\nbook that is more likely to be used as a resource\nto be dipped into as appropriate than it is to be\nread from cover to cover and the index\nfacilitates this mode of use.\nPart I opens with Roger Boshier's (Canada)\ncontribution on the twenty-five years following\nthe publication of the Faure Report, 'Learning\nto Be: The World of Today and Tomorrow', in\n1972. The Faure report was born on the wave of\nprotest in the 1960s and constructed as a\nblueprint for educational reform defining four\ndimensions of lifelong learning: vertical integra-\ntion (cradle to grave); horizontal integration\n(education in non-formal as well as formal\nsettings); democratization (improving access\nand involving learners in the design of the\neducational process); the learning society (the\nrequirement for a restructuring of education\nsystems). Implementation of lifelong learning\nhas shifted the vision from 'a neo-Marxist or\nanarchistic-utopian template for reform to a\nneo-liberal, functionalist rendition orchestrated\nas a corollary of globalisation and hyper-capital-\nism'. Colin Griffin's (UK) paper analyses the\nnon-linear journey from public rhetoric in the\nFaure Report to its implementation in the public\npolicy documents that emerged from the\nEuropean Year of Lifelong Learning in 1996.\nBarry Hake (Netherlands) offers a critique of\nEU policies on lifelong learning in terms of\nsociological theories of globalization, reflexive\nmodernization and risk society. Michael Collins\n(Canada) reframes the discourse on lifelong\nlearning and reminds educators that 'these are\nthe times . . . to adopt political strategies for\nadding substance' to Faure.\nPart II opens with a chapter by Peter Jarvis (UK)\non the paradoxes of the learning society\nexploring three interpretations of the learning\n107\nReviews\nsociety: a futuristic ideal; as a reaction to social\nchange and a marketing phenomenon of the\ninformation society, i.e. a consumer society; and\nthe inherent paradoxes of these formulations and\nthe place for education. Elaine Butler (Australia)\ndebates the implications of lifelong learning and\nthe interrelationship with globalism and new\nmanagerialism for the production of working\nsubjects in the post-industrial era. Theo Jansen,\nMatthias Finger and Danny Wildemeersch\n(Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands)\nexplore the significance of aesthetic reflexivity\nfor adult education. Brian Connelly (UK) looks\nat lifelong learning through the Habermasian\nlens ('an interdisciplinary macrotheory of com-\nmunicative action based on a long-term critical\nengagement with, and modification of, theories\nof philosophy, sociology, politics, psychology\nand linguistics') to provide a theoretical ground-\ning to adult education practice.\nPart III focuses on lifelong learning in political\ntransitions and presents four country case\nstudies reflecting the multiple utilities of lifelong\nlearning. Bobby Soobrayan (South Africa)\ndescribes the conceptual malleability of lifelong\nlearning in mirroring 'the dominant political\nagenda of reconciliation'. In Germany, as\ndescribed by Marion Sporing (UK), lifelong\nlearning is seen as a cure for unemployment. In\nChina, Xiao Fang (China) describes the\nexploitation of lifelong learning in the develop-\nment of the private sector. John Holford's (UK)\nchapter describes the lack of a co-ordinated\npolicy framework in Hong Kong where lifelong\nlearning is still largely conceived as 'adult\nlearning' or as 'continuing education'.\nIn Part IV Jukka Tuomisto (Finland) provides a\nFinnish perspective on policy and reality.\nMichael Law (New Zealand) analyses critically\nthe radical changes to schooling and post-\ncompulsory education in New Zealand that have\nresulted from economic and social restructuring\nfrom a labour studies perspective emphasizing\nthe concerns of working people. Hiromi Sasai\n(Japan) analyses lifelong learning policies in\nJapan where lifelong learning is termed social\neducation and the policies encourage subsidies\nfor capital infrastructure, funding to provide\nlectures and courses in public halls and for the\ntraining of social education experts. Fran\nFerrier (Australia) explores the implications of\nthe Australian User Choice initiative to lifelong\nlearning. Peter Jarvis, John Holford and Colin\nGriffin (UK) conclude Part IV with an account\nof the voucher experience in the City of London.\n108\nDavid Boud (Australia) opens Part V with the\nquestion of how university work-based courses\ncan contribute to lifelong learning. Paul Hager\nand David Beckett (Australia) ask what lifelong\nlearning would look like in a learning setting\nexploring the differences between workplace\nlearning and more formal education systems and\nsuggesting that the way ahead for workplace\nlearning should be a focus on the contingent, the\npractical, the process, the particular and the\naffective and social domains. Aureliana Alberici\n(Italy) relates Italian perspectives on the\nlearning society. Cliff Falk (Canada) sentences\nlearners to life as he retrofits the academy for the\ninformation age. Matthew Williamson and\nMargaret Wallis (UK) explore the role of the\npublic library in lifelong learning as an integral\npart of the National Grid for Learning in the\nUK through its public accessibility.\nPart VI has four chapters looking at learning\nand change at work. Paul Tosey and John\nNugent (UK) reflect on their consulting\nexperience within one learning organization.\nFred Scheid, Sharon Howell, Vicki Carter and\nJudith Preston (USA) critically study the\nlearning organization concept addressing issues\nof agency, decoding some of the language and\nsuggesting that learning organizations have used\nlifelong learning as a means to maximize effect-\niveness and drastically to reduce labour costs.\nAnnikki Jarvinen (Finland) analyses two\napproaches (Nonaka's dialogue between tacit\nand explicit knowledge and Boland and\nTensaki's production of knowledge to create\ninnovative products and processes which require\nthe ability to make strong perspectives within a\ncommunity as well as being able to take account\nof other people's perspectives) for organizing\nlearning during organizational innovations and\nthe implications for education presenting the\npreliminary findings of a case study.

Venitha Pillay (South Africa)\naddresses two main questions: firstly, whether\nthe new educational model sufficiently recog-\nnizes and acts upon the gender inequities of the\napartheid education system; and secondly,\nwhether the concept of lifelong learning pro-\nmotes gender equity or serves to create and\/or\nmaintain inequity suggesting that all educational\npolicy development should be premised on the\nrecognition of gender as a variable that can have\nsignificant outcomes in the education equation.\nJanko Berlogar (Slovenia) argues that the reality\nin which employees strive for their education is\nthat of political utilitarianism and that the\neducation of employees is an important, internal\nbut usually neglected part of business social\nresponsibility.\nOverall, this book contains a mixed bag of\nofferings from policy development to the\nimplications of pragmatic implementation of\nlifelong learning in varying international and\npolitical contexts. The book is a well-edited\ncollection of papers that will be of interest to\nserious students of lifelong learning around the\nworld.\nEleri Jones, University of Wales Institute Cardiff\nBeverly L. Cameron, Active Learning - Green\nGuide No. 2, Halifax, Canada: Society for\nTeaching and Learning in Higher Education,\n1999. ISBN: 0-7703-8466-8. Paperback, 35\npages, $10 Cdn.\nThe aim of the Green Guide Series is to present\nresearch and theory about specific aspects of\nteaching and learning in higher education in the\ncontext of current practice. In the second Green\nGuide in the series, Beverly J. Cameron focuses\non the challenging issue of promoting active\nlearning and critical thinking in higher\neducation. The Guide is aimed at educators who\nare new to the topic of active learning and are\ninterested in finding practical strategies for\nintroducing it into their courses.\nThe Guide begins with a section entitled\n'Definitions and a Brief Literature Review'. This\nintroduces the reader to the topics of active\nlearning, creative thinking and problem-solving\nand concludes with a working definition of\neffective thinking. The second section, 'Linking\nEffective Thinking and Active Learning' intro-\nduces Kolb's experiential learning cycle. A brief\ncase is presented for the use of Kolb's model as a\nframework for accomplishing effective thinking.\nThese first two sections cover an immense area\nof research and theory in only six pages. Thus,\nalthough they set the scene and are written in a\nclear and accessible way, they may leave the\nreader looking for a more in-depth coverage of\nthe theory underpinning the topic.\nThe third section, 'Introducing Active Learning\nto the Classroom' begins by emphasizing the\npoint that a change is required in the mindset of\nboth teacher and student when undertaking\nactive learning and the author recommends a\ncarefully planned introduction of active learning\ntechniques. This section includes a number of\nsuggestions about strategies and techniques that\nteachers can use in the classroom. In total\nseventeen different techniques and activities are\ndiscussed, beginning with those seen as fairly\nlow risk to those perceived as being more risky.\nIn this context, risk is seen in terms of the degree\nof departure from familiar instructional settings\nsuch as the lecture. Specific emphasis is placed\non the importance of building multiple oppor-\ntunities for active learning into a course design,\nin order to enable students to 'have opportun-\nities to develop the skills of effective thinking'.\nEach of the techniques is presented first in terms\nof process, that is the intention of the activity\nand the way the activity relates to Kolb's learn-\ning model. This is then followed up by\n'suggestions', additional strategies to assist the\nteacher to facilitate the activity. This section will\nprove helpful to educators who are just\nbeginning to adopt active learning approaches\nas it introduces a range of helpful strategies and\nactivities. However, by presenting activities that\nfocus on specific stages in the experiential\nlearning cycle there is a slight loss of focus on\nthe overall cycle and the holistic view of\nexperiential learning is reduced to a rather\nprocedural set of activities.\nThe fourth section 'Making Changes to Active\nLearning Techniques' deals with issues of\nmanaging students' expectations and to help\nthem actively engage with the learning process.\nCameron also discusses the need for teachers to\naddress changes to assessment and marking\nschemes to reflect the objectives of active\nlearning. This discussion is then followed by a\nshort overview of the various facets of group\nwork as they apply to active learning. The final\nsection 'Implementing Active Learning' very\nbriefly discusses outcomes of active learning for\nboth student and teacher.\n109\nReviews\nIn summary, Active Learning - Green Guide No 2\nprovides a very brief glimpse of the research and\ntheory about active learning and begins to\naddress some of the practical issues of imple-\nmenting active learning strategies in the class-\nroom. The practical guidance will be useful to\nthose new to active learning. However, the lack\nof depth in presenting the theoretical under-\npinning may leave others a little short on detail\nabout active learning and the impression of a\nrather procedural approach.\nSue Fowell, University of New South Wales\nKrystyna Weinstein, Action Learning \u2014 A\nPractical Guide - 2nd edition, Aldershot: Gower,\n1999. ISBN: 0-566-08097-4. Paperback, xiv+230\npages. \u00a318.99.\nInterest in the subject of action learning has\nincreased over the past few years and\nprogrammes of action learning are now well\nestablished in many universities and workplaces.\nThis book (an updated and expanded version of\nan earlier edition) introduces the topic of action\nlearning and is primarily aimed at practitioners\nand participants who are new to the area. It\nprovides a useful source of advice and guidance\nby presenting insights into the experiences of\nlearning set members and the process of\ndeveloping and facilitating action learning\nprogrammes. There are two parts to the book,\nthe first part includes two chapters that deal\nwith the definitions of action learning and their\ntheoretical and philosophical origins; the second\npart focuses on action learning in practice and\nthe process of programme development.\nMost of the chapters in this book include one or\nmore case studies that ground the content of the\nchapter in the experiences of action learners.\nThe examples illustrate a range of settings and\ntypes of activity where action learning has been\napplied.\nChapter 1 begins by discussing the meaning of\naction learning and goes on to explore the\nreasons why organizations choose to take an\naction learning approach, the various kinds of\nprogrammes they initiate, and the benefits of\nbeing a participant in an action learning pro-\ngramme. Chapter 2 covers the theory and\nphilosophy behind action learning and provides\ndefinitions that help to convey the spirit of\naction learning as well as providing a more\ndetailed look at the underlying values and\nmodels. This is not an in-depth exploration but a\nclearly written overview of the area, providing\nNO\nan introduction to the basic premises of action\nlearning as well as explaining how the approach\nfollowed in this book differs from similar\napproaches.\nPart II Action Learning in Practice includes nine\nchapters that, as the title suggests, focus on the\npracticalities of implementing programmes of\naction learning. Chapter 3 explores the nature of\nthe action learning set and makes comparisons\nwith other kinds of group work. Chapter 4\nexplores the action part of action learning and\naddresses the nature of projects and tasks and\nhow they are selected and tackled.\nChapter 5 focuses on the processes that take\nplace in the learning set and what it takes to be\nan effective set member, and Chapter 6 explores\nthe role of the learning set adviser. Chapter 7\nconsiders why action learning programmes often\nrequire more time to complete than other forms\nof learning. Emphasis here is on the value of\ntaking time to establish the learning set, for\nparticipants to get to know each other and to\ndevelop the skills required for effective action\nlearning.\nChapter 8 covers the learning that takes place\nalongside the action, outlining methods for\ndocumenting learning such as keeping a diary\nand learning notes. This chapter also considers\nthe ways the achievements of action learners can\nbe evaluated. Chapter 9 is a very short chapter\nsummarizing the reservations people have about\naction learning and discussion focuses on ways\nof overcoming these reservations.\nChapter 10 on the future of action learning\nmakes links to the area of organizational\nlearning and looks at other opportunities for\norganizations to apply action learning. For\ninstance, action learning can be used as an\napproach for exploring problems and stresses\narising from information overload and\nsituations of job change and uncertainty.\nThe final chapter contains guidelines and\nsuggestions about how to go about designing an\naction learning programme. This chapter\nincludes helpful notes and recommendations for\nthe structure of meetings and learning sets as\nwell as a discussion about potential pitfalls and\nhow to avoid or recover from them.\nAlthough there are now many books on action\nlearning, I would expect that most people would\nfind this book a useful addition to their\ncollection. Weinstein provides a balanced\naccount of the benefits and limitations of action\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nlearning. Although she is clearly a skilled and\nexperienced practitioner with a strong\ncommitment to action learning, she does not\nsimply present an over-optimistic view but\naddresses the concerns that many people have\nabout action learning and presents a very\npractical guide to effective programme develop-\nment. The book is well written and the case\nstudies and personal experiences provide\nvaluable insights into the practical application\nof action learning.\nSue Fowell, University of New South Wales\nI l l\n"}
