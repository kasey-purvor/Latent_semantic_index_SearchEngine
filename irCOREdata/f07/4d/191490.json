It uses target-specific pairs of PCR primers that are physically separated by \nsurface immobilization. Initial surface-based amplification cycles are then coupled to efficient \nsolution-phase PCR using one common primer pair. We demonstrate this method by co-\namplifying and genotyping 75 unselected human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci.  \nThe key challenge in developing a high-multiplex amplification procedure is preventing excessive \noff-target priming by the many primers in the reaction1\u20133. Several previously developed methods \nuse surface immobilization of primer pairs as a way to separate reactions and thus limit primer-\ndimer formation4\u20136, but drawbacks of these methods include inefficient amplification, loss of \nreactants from the surface and considerable primer-dimer formation within pairs of primers. \nMegaPlex PCR likewise uses physical separation of primer pairs to prevent their interaction, but it \nadditionally includes \u2018common sequences\u2019 at the 5\u2032 ends of the surface primers so that early-stage \namplicons can be moved into the solution phase for co-amplification by highly efficient and \nunbiased PCR using a single common primer pair6\u20138 (Fig. 1). To reduce primer-dimer formation, \nMegaPlex PCR uses surface primers that are made partially double-stranded by base-pairing their \ncommon 5\u2032 sequences with complementary \u2018barrier oligonucleotides\u2019. A detailed methods \ndescription is available in Supplementary Methods online. \nDuring the development of MegaPlex PCR we evaluated a range of targets, input DNAs and \nreaction conditions. We used membrane arrays and microbeads as binding surfaces, with the beads \nnow routinely attached to microtiter plate wells to provide a platform compatible with automation. \nUsing the microbead support we found MegaPlex PCR  to be effective with as little as 200 ng of \nhuman genomic DNA, and in various 15-plex reactions it recovered many different target sequences \nof up to at least 500 bp in size, with little bias against larger amplicons (Supplementary Fig. 1 \nonline). As occasional targets (~1\/10 in preliminary studies) generated severe primer-dimer \nartifacts, regardless of the multiplex level of the experiment, optimization of MegaPlex PCR was \nrequired. One option was the exclusion of these targets by empirical or computational prefiltering, \nbut we selected a modification that avoided the need for target preselection. \n \nThis modification involves enriching the input genomic DNA for sequences of interest via a \ncrude solution-phase multiplex PCR using specific primers for all the amplification targets. The \nprimer sequences for this can match the specific portions of those on the solid surface, or they can \nbe designed to prime slightly outside these sites in the genomic DNA. This strategy is used \nroutinely in digital molecular counting and genome mapping studies that use limiting-dilution \nsamples, with multiplexing up to at least 1,200 (ref. 9). Although this is less specific than \nconventional PCR, it can be expected to efficiently enrich ~80% of all target sequences for which \nprimers are included (Paul Dear, MRC LMB, Cambridge, UK, personal communication). The \nincreased abundance of these fragments allows them to outcompete artifacts resulting from primer-\ndimer formation. An additional benefit of first enriching the input DNA is that less genomic DNA is \nneeded per experiment (tens versus hundreds to thousands of nanograms). Other multiplex \namplification methods have also used such an enrichment step10.  \nTo demonstrate the complete MegaPlex PCR procedure, we used it to amplify and genotype \n75 randomly selected prevalidated human SNPs (Supplementary Table 1 online). To assess \ntechnical reproducibility, we amplified all 75 targets (MP75) as well as a subset of 50 loci (MP50). \nThe protocol used microbeads adhered to the walls of microtiter plate wells as the solid surface, and \ngenomic DNA samples enriched for the MP75 and the MP50 sets of targets. This level of \nmultiplexing of completely unselected sequences would not work well using standard multiplex \nPCR in solution, as demonstrated by the nonspecific product smear generated by the initial DNA \nenrichment in these experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2 online). More sophisticated strategies for \nsolution-phase multiplex PCR11,12 can operate at this multiplex level, but they require careful \npreselection of targets.  \nWe first examined the MP50 and MP75 Megaplex PCR products by agarose gel \nelectrophoresis (Fig. 2a). This revealed amplified material that closely matched the expected size \nrange for the two sets of targets (Fig. 2b), with larger amplicons being too faint to see because we \nincluded few such targets in the experiment. Notably, we detected no primer-dimers in this \npreliminary analysis. Then we conducted secondary singleplex PCRs on aliquots of the MP50 \nproduct for a random set of 21 of the loci, of which 20 produced clean gel bands of uniform \nintensity and of the expected sizes (data not shown). These initial results thus implied that the \nmajority of the targeted SNP loci were effectively amplified by MegaPlex PCR. \nTo further assess the MP50 and MP75 products we used (i) microarray hybridization on the \nGENIOM platform13, and (ii) single-molecule counting by sequencing on the Roche Genome \nSequencer 20 system (GS20)14.  \n \nFor the hybridization analysis, we used oligonucleotide arrays carrying several sequence \nrepresentations each of the 75 SNP loci and of a control set of 42 unrelated single-copy human \ngenome fragments, all of which were duplicated on the array. We hybridized biotin-labeled MP50 \nand MP75 products onto these arrays, allowing subsequent fluorescence detection with streptavidin-\nR-phycoerythrin-conjugate. To control for differential hybridization efficiency among the 75 \ntargets, we performed a control hybridization with a normalized pool (called C90) of all 75 \nMegaPlex targets plus 15 additional DNA fragments that were represented on the array but not \npresent in the MegaPlex amplifications. Upon comparing the MP50 and the MP75 signals to those \nof the control C90 hybridization, we observed uniform target recovery rates in each experiment \n(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3 online), and excellent reproducibility for targets shared between \nMP50 and MP75 (Fig. 2d). We determined the target-specific relative recovery rates by dividing \nthe MegaPlex product signals by their paired C90 signals. From this analysis we omitted targets \nwith signals below background in the C90 data (6 targets in MP50 and 12 in MP75) as we \npresumed they were undetectable with the array conditions used. Only four targets were not \nrecovered according to this analysis, as they gave signals weaker than background in the MegaPlex \nPCR hybridizations even though they were detectable in the C90 hybridization. Among the \nremaining (quantifiable) targets, the microarray analysis indicated that the great majority of targets \nwere recovered with efficiencies that varied over little more than a tenfold range (Fig. 2e and \nSupplementary Fig. 3). \nTo conduct the GS20 sequence-based analysis we first re-amplified the MP50 and MP75 \nproducts by PCR using \u2018fusion\u2019 primers (MegaPlex common primers flanked at their 5\u2032 ends with \nGS20 primer sequences) to introduce priming sites required by this sequencing technology. We then \nre-amplified these products by emulsion PCR to produce single-molecule clones on beads, of which \naround 80,000 were sequenced per experiment. These additional amplification cycles (especially \nthe \u2018fusion\u2019 PCR) could potentially distort individual target recovery levels relative to their \nrepresentations in the primary MegaPlex products. Nevertheless, counts of each target sequence \nindicated that most targets were recovered within about a 100-fold range (Fig. 2e and \nSupplementary Fig. 3), with excellent reproducibility between experiments (Fig. 2f). Only 7 and \n15 expected SNP loci were not observed at all in the sequencing reads for MP50 and MP75, \nrespectively. This is consistent with our expectation that up to 20% of loci might not be enriched by \nthe particular genomic DNA preprocessing step we used. If 100% of targets had to be recovered, or \nthe desired multiplex level was considerably greater than that supported by the particular input \nDNA enrichment method we used (that is, 103 or so), one might use an alternative enrichment \nprocedure or empirically preselect for primers that do not generate excessive primer-dimers. \n \nBy directly comparing the GS20-based and the array-based data (Fig. 2e and \nSupplementary Fig. 3) we found that the relative recovery rates for specific targets estimated by \nthese two analyses were in good agreement, thereby cross-validating these two analytical strategies. \nWe considered the larger overall spread of recovery rates in the GS20 data to be an artifact resulting \nfrom the multiple rounds of PCR we had to perform to apply that technology. \nAdditional analysis of the GS20 data allowed us to determine SNP genotypes for the input \nDNA sample, as many representations of each chromosome copy (allele) per SNP had been \nsequenced. If we observed only one allele repeatedly, we scored the sample as homozygous for that \nallele, whereas if we observed many examples of both alleles, we scored it as heterozygous. The \nMP50 and MP75 experiments gave consistent genotype indications for targets they had in common \n(Supplementary Table 2 online), and we then validated all of these genotype assignments by \ndynamic allele-specific hybridization15. Across 12 heterozygous SNPs the median abundance for \nthe least represented allele was 37.7% (minimum = 15.3%), and across 26 homozygous SNPs the \nmedian abundance for the correct allele was 99.6% (minimum = 95.4%). \nFinally, the GS20 data revealed that, despite not preselecting targets or primer sequences in \nany way, less than 10% of all the amplified products were primer-dimer artifacts. Almost all of \nthese involved just 3 structures (each at ~3%) wherein dimerization had occurred between highly \ncomplementary 3\u2032 ends of primers designed for different targets. Encouragingly, each of these \ntroublesome primers still produced authentic targets. This is a major improvement over previous \nmultiplex PCR strategies, and something that may allow MegaPlex PCR to support extremely high \nmultiplex applications, such as the direct isolation of many different exons and\/or promoters from a \ncomplex genome. \nNote: Supplementary information is available on the Nature Methods website. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis study was supported by the EU Sixth Framework Programme integrated project MOLTOOLS (to A.J.B.). \nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \nL.S.M. and A.J.B. designed and planned the study.
