The EISCAT Svalbard radar employed a novel scanning mode in order to obtain F and E region ion flows over an annular region centered on the radar. Simultaneously, a colocated Scanning Doppler Imager observed the E region neutral winds and temperatures around 110 km altitude using the 557.7 nm auroral optical emission. Combining the ion and neutral data permits the E region Joule heating to be estimated with an azimuthal spatial resolution of \u223c64 km at a radius of \u223c163 km from the radar.

Introduction\n[2] At high latitudes, magnetosphere\u2010ionosphere coupling\nis achieved through large\u2010scale field\u2010aligned current (FAC)\nsystems [e.g., Iijima and Potemra, 1976; Kosch and Nielsen,\n2001; Zmuda and Armstrong, 1974]. In the premagnetic\nmidnight dusk sector, downward FACs flow equatorward of\nthe upward return currents and vice versa in the postmagnetic\nmidnight dawn sector. The large\u2010scale morphology of the\nFACs is controlled by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nBz and By components [Weimer, 2001]. For Bz negative the\nstatistical strength of the FAC is controlled by the amplitude\nof Bz [Kosch and Nielsen, 2001]. For Bz positive, the FAC\nstrength weakens and breaks up into multiple zones [Friis\u2010\nChristensen et al., 1985; Iijima and Shibaji, 1987]. These\ncurrents close via poleward (equatorward) ionospheric Ped-\nersen currents in the dusk (dawn) sector and dissipate energy\nvia Joule heating, which is largely an E region phenomenon\nin the ionosphere [Brekke and Rino, 1978].\n[3] Ionospheric Joule heating is an important energy\nsink for the magnetosphere [Akasofu, 1981; Rodger et al.,\n2001], accounting for \u223c55\u201360% of the global energy bud-\nget [Tanskanen et al., 2002; \u00d8stgaard et al., 2002] and is\nusually greater than the energy dissipated from particle pre-\ncipitation [e.g., Ahn et al., 1983; Banks et al., 1977;\u00d8stgaard\net al., 2002]. Unfortunately, it is difficult to monitor the\nglobal ionospheric electric field and Pedersen conductance\nsimultaneously, which is why global Joule heating is often\nparameterized using geomagnetic indices [e.g., Aikio and\nSelk\u00e4l\u00e4, 2009; Kosch and Nielsen, 1995, and references\ntherein]. Height\u2010integrated ionospheric Joule heating is typ-\nically <30 mW\/m2, although peak values can be much greater\nthan this [Kosch and Nielsen, 1995]. Joule heating is often\nexpressed by the simplified equation, which ignores the\nneutral wind dynamo:\nQJH \u00bc E2S\u0001P \u00f01\u00de\nwhere E is the electric field magnitude andSsP is the height\u2010\nintegrated Pedersen conductance [Kosch et al., 1998]. The\nionospheric Pedersen conductivity is obtained from [Brekke\nand Rino, 1978; Egeland et al., 1973]\n\u0001p \u00bc qneB\nke\n1\u00fe k2e\n\u00fe ki\n1\u00fe k2i\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the electronic charge, ne is the plasma density from\nradar measurements, and B is the magnetic field strength.\nHere k = W\/n, where W is the cyclotron frequency, n the\ncollision frequency with neutrals, and e and i denote electrons\nand ions, respectively. Also,W = qB\/m, wherem is the species\nmass. B and n can be estimated from models.

The lower E region\nion\u2010neutral collision frequency can be obtained from Schunk\nand Nagy [2009], assuming an ion composition of 75% NO+\nand 25% O2\n+, including resonant collisions between O2 and\nO2\n+ [Schunk and Walker, 1973], and neglecting lighter ions\nsuch as O+ below 140 km altitude:\n\u0003i \u00bc 4:29\u0002 10\u000316nN2 \u00fe 4:23\u0002 10\u000316nO2 \u00fe 2:41\u0002 10\u000316nO Hz\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhere n is the neutral density of the relevant species obtained\nfrom the MSIS model [Hedin et al., 1977]. Referenced to the\nfixed frame of the Earth, the ionospheric electric field (E) is\nexpressed by\nE\n* \u00bc \u0003 V*\nF\n\u0002 B*\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere V\n*\nF is the ion velocity observed by radar in the near\u2010\ncollisionless F region (>200 km). Assuming no other forces\nexcept an electric field in a magnetized plasma, the general-\nized ion motion (Vi) is given by [Brekke, 1997]\nV\n*\ni\n\u00bc ki\n1\u00fe k2i\nE\n*\nB\n\u00fe k\n2\ni\n1\u00fe k2i\nE\n*\u0002 B*\nB2\n\u00f05\u00de\nand the direction of the ion flow relative to the electric field\nvector (\u0004) is given by [Brekke et al., 1990]\ntan \u0004\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ki \u00f06\u00de\nWhether the first or second term of equation (5) dominates the\nion velocity direction depends on the value of ki. In the near\u2010\ncollisionless F layer (>200 km), the second term dominates\nand the ion velocity is perpendicular to the electric and\nmagnetic field directions. This gives the ionospheric electric\nfield directly from equation (4). In the highly collisional\nD region (<90 km), the first term dominates and the ion\nvelocity is in the direction of the electric field. However,\nsomewhere in the E region, where ki = 1, the ion flow will be\nat 45\u00b0 to the E and E \u00d7 B directions. This depends on altitude\nasWi depends linearly on B and ni depends linearly on nn (see\nequation (3)). In the auroral zone, for \u2223E\u2223 > 25 mV\/m, Fujii\net al. [1998] found that ions moved in the E \u00d7 B direction\nat altitudes \u2265 117 km and in the E field direction at altitudes\n\u2264 101 km. These altitudes are not fixed since the neutral\ndensity (nn) is variable, as witnessed by strong vertical winds\nin the E layer up to 50 m\/s [e.g., Price et al., 1995] and F layer\nup to 150 m\/s [e.g., Innis et al., 1999; Rees et al., 1984] which\nare often associated with auroral precipitation or Joule heat-\ning events [Smith, 1998, and references therein]. Of course,\nequations (5) and (6) are modified if neutral winds are present\nas the drag term will add another vector component to the ion\nvelocity, especially below \u223c110 km [Brekke et al., 1990].\n[4] It is well established that high\u2010latitude thermospheric\nneutral circulation is driven by ion drag, solar heating pres-\nsure, advection (momentum), viscous and Coriolis forces.\nIon drag through ion\u2010neutral collisions and pressure gradients\ndue to solar heating are normally the dominant driving forces\nin the F layer [e.g., Killeen and Roble, 1984] but advec-\ntion, solar heating, and Coriolis forces may all exceed the ion\ndrag force, depending on the plasma density height profile\n[Crickmore, 1995]. The pressure from solar heating and the\nCoriolis force are normally the dominant drivers of neutral\ndynamics in the E layer although ion drag and advection may\nalso be important depending again on the plasma density\n[e.g., Killeen and Roble, 1984, 1986; Maeda et al., 1999;\nNozawa et al., 2005; Tsuda et al., 2007]. Tsuda et al. [2009]\nshowed that the pressure gradient from Joule heating could\nbecome the dominant force in the E region. In the polar cap,\nNozawa et al. [2005] and Tsuda et al. [2007] showed from\nground\u2010based radar observations that ion drag above 118 and\n106 km, respectively, played a role in neutral wind acceler-\nation, consistent with >105 km derived from satellite obser-\nvations by Richmond et al. [2003]. On the other hand, Tsuda\net al. [2007] also showed that ion motion below 104 km in\nthe polar cap was controlled by the neutral winds through\ncollisions. Hence \u223c105\u2013120 km is the transition region,\nbelow which the neutrals control the ions and above which\nthe ions, driven by the magnetospheric convection electric\nfield, control the neutrals.\n[5] The ion\u2010neutral coupling e\u2010folding time (tin) is given\nby\n\u0005in \u00bc nnni\n1\n\u0003i\ns \u00f07\u00de\nwhere ni is the ion density. In the thermospheric F layer,\nneutral circulation broadly follows plasma convection with\nan e\u2010folding time of 0.5\u20133.5 h [Heelis et al., 2002; Killeen\nand Roble, 1984, 1988; Kosch et al., 2001a], depending\non geomagnetic activity, season, and local time. The ion drag\ne\u2010folding time has not been measured in the E layer. How-\never, since ni is linear with nn (see equation (3)) [Schunk\nand Nagy, 2009], the change in e\u2010folding time essentially\nbecomes a function of plasma density with altitude. At\nhigh latitudes, auroral precipitation frequently enhances the\nE region plasma density by an order of magnitude or more,\nenhancing coupling between ions and neutrals. Therefore the\ndominant circulation driver, i.e., ions or neutrals, depends on\nthe local plasma density [Tsuda et al., 2007].\n[6] E region winds maximize around 100\u2013110 km altitude\nwith maximum speeds exceeding 100 m\/s [Nozawa and\nBrekke, 1999] and may experience a large shear with a ver-\ntical scale of 10 km or less [Larsen, 2002]. The E region\nneutral wind (UE) can be derived from radar observations of\nthe E region ion velocity (VE) as follows [Rino et al., 1977]:\nU\n*\nE\n\u00bc V*\nE\n\u0003 ki\nB\nE\n*\u00fe V*\nE\n\u0002 B*\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u00f08\u00de\nwhere E is obtained from equation (4). This has been done\nsuccessfully in the height range 90\u2013120 km using a model for\nni to obtain ki [e.g.,Maeda et al., 1999; Nozawa and Brekke,\n1999; Nozawa et al., 2005, 2006; Tsuda et al., 2007]. If the\nassumption UE = 0 is made, then equation (8) can be trivially\nrearranged to solve for ki and hence ni. This has been done\nsuccessfully for heights <140 km [e.g., Davies et al., 1997,\nand references therein]. However, ifUE is also observed by an\noptical method (described below) then ni can be determined\nuniquely without any assumptions. A similar technique has\nbeen used in the F region using radar and optical observations\nat high [Winser et al., 1988; Davis et al., 1995] and low\n[Burnside et al., 1987] latitudes.We employ this ground\u2010based\nKOSCH ET AL.: MESOSCALE POLAR IONOSPHERE VARIABILITY A05321A05321\n2 of 16\ntechnique for the first time in the lower E region using\nsimultaneous ion and neutral flow observations. Once ni is\nknown, equation (3) is trivially rearranged to solve for nn,\nalthough it is not possible to determine the neutral composi-\ntion. The solar minimum period of cycle 23\/24 recently ended\nhas experienced solar and geomagnetic activity at their lowest\npoint for a century [Lockwood et al., 2009; Russell et al.,\n2010]. Deep solar minima are associated with atmospheric\ncooling and therefore contraction [Emmert et al., 2010;\nRussell et al., 2010]. Satellite observations of the ionosphere\n[e.g., Heelis et al., 2009] and the thermosphere [e.g., Emmert\net al., 2010] at 400 km altitude show that both were cooler and\nless dense in 2008 than at any other time since the beginning\nof the space age. In particular, Emmert et al. [2010] found that\nthe global average thermospheric mass density to be 10\u201330%\nlower than expected. Since estimates of anthropogenic forc-\ning and long\u2010term climatological trends cannot account for\nmost of the density change [Emmert et al., 2010], the main\ndriver appears to be solar EUV [Solomon et al., 2010]. We\nuse equations (8) and (3) to compare the E region ion\u2010neutral\ncollision frequency from observations to that derived from\nthe MSIS atmospheric model.\n[7] Thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures can be\nderived from passive Doppler measurements of the naturally\noccurring 630 and 557.7 nm optical emissions in the F and\nE layers, respectively, using ground\u2010based Fabry\u2010Perot\ninterferometers (FPI) [e.g., Hernandez, 1986]. Since these\nare passive observations, the derived neutral winds and tem-\nperatures will be an average in altitude weighted according to\nthe optical emission intensity profile. Traditionally, an aver-\nage neutral wind vector has been derived by scanning the sky\nat different azimuths at a fixed zenith angle for an assumed\naltitude, typically close to \u223c240 and \u223c115 km for 630 and\n557.7 nm, respectively [Griffin et al., 2006; Kosch et al.,\n2000a]. This technique is greatly enhanced by the recent\ndevelopment of scanning Doppler imagers (SDI), which can\nderive line\u2010of\u2010sight wind measurements from many tens of\nsoftware\u2010defined directions simultaneously in a wide field of\nview [Conde and Smith, 1997, 1998]. The information from\nall line\u2010of\u2010sight Doppler measurements is used to derive an\nequivalent horizontal wind vector field assuming the vertical\nwinds are small. Details of the fitting algorithm are given by\nAnderson et al. [2009, and references therein]. The assump-\ntion of small vertical thermospheric winds, especially in the\nE region, is generally valid for quiet to moderate geomagnetic\nconditions [e.g., Kosch et al., 2000b]. In addition, a practical\ndifficulty is that the SDI can only unambiguously measure\nvertical winds in the zenith line of sight and it cannot be\nassumed that this vertical atmospheric motion is the same\nover the whole instrument\u2019s field of view [e.g., Price et al.,\n1995; Kosch et al., 2000b]. Despite this limitation, the SDI\nis powerful for two reasons: (1) it can differentiate between\nspatial and temporal ambiguities in the thermospheric neutral\nwind field and (2) it observes with mesoscale resolution in\nmultiple directions simultaneously. The typical time resolu-\ntion of this optical technique is 1\u201320 min, depending on the\nemission intensity. The typical spatial resolution is about 50\nand 100 km in the E and F layers, respectively.\n[8] The O1S emission at 557.7 nm results from a com-\nbination of three sources, namely, airglow around the meso-\npause at about 97 km [Phillips et al., 1994], dissociative\nrecombination in the thermosphere, and auroral particle pre-\ncipitation in the E region [Rees, 1989]. The primary flux of\nelectron energy into the auroral atmosphere is 1\u201310 keV\n[Burch, 1991]. Optical triangulation has shown that the\naurora normally occurs above 100 km altitude [Currie, 1955;\nSt\u00f6rmer, 1955]. At high latitudes, the auroral component\ndominates when present but can be highly variable in inten-\nsity and height, which is related to the energy (Y) of the\nprecipitating particles as follows [del Pozo et al., 1997]:\nY H\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 4\u0002 105e\u00030:101H keV\u00f0 \u00de \u00f09\u00de\nwhere H is height in kilometers. Since the O1S emission\nmay occur at any height from \u223c97 to \u223c200 km, spanning\nmany scale heights, no default altitude can be assumed when\nmaking passive observations. However, the altitude can be\ndetermined either by comparing the observed neutral and ion\ntemperatures derived from SDI and radar data, respectively,\ncomparing the observed neutral temperature with thermo-\nspheric models (e.g., CTIP) [Kosch et al., 2010] or by mod-\neling the photon production rate from the plasma density\nprofile [Link and Cogger, 1988; Vlasov et al., 2005]. In the\nlower E region, Ti \u2248 Tn to a reasonably good approximation\n[Griffin et al., 2006; Kurihara et al., 2009; Nozawa et al.,\n2006]. During periods of Joule heating, Ti > Tn by up to\n\u223c20% have been inferred from radar data between 105 and\n115 km altitude [Maeda et al., 2002]. During periods of\nlarge electric field enhancements (100 mV\/m) Ti can exceed\nTn by up to \u223c30% at 116 km [Maeda et al., 2005, Figure 3].\nIn this study we have used the last twomethods for estimating\nthe effective 557.7 nm emission height.\n[9] The spatial scales of structures in the ionospheric\nauroral plasma can vary from the whole auroral oval down to\nthe Debye length limit [Galperin, 2002]. In particular, auroral\narcs may be 100s to even 1000s of km geomagnetic east\u2010west\naligned but the average optical width of steady state auroral\narcs is only 18 \u00b1 9 km [Knudsen et al., 2001]. Auroral pre-\ncipitation is associated with upward FACs [e.g., Arnoldy,\n1974; Kamide and Akasofu, 1976] and local changes in\nionospheric conductivity [e.g., Kosch et al., 2001b]. The\nupward FACmust return via an equivalent downward FAC in\norder to satisfy current continuity, connecting in the iono-\nsphere via Pedersen currents [Tsunoda et al., 1976] and dis-\nsipating energy in the form of Joule heating (see equation (1)).\nThe closing downward current normally appears equator-\nward (poleward) of the auroral arc in the dusk (dawn) sector,\nconsistent with the large\u2010scale ionospheric electric field\nassociated with ionospheric convection [Aikio et al., 1993;\nArmstrong et al., 1975; Lewis et al., 1994], although this is\nnot always the case [Opgenoorth et al., 1990]. Normally, the\nlocal arc\u2010induced ionospheric electric field enhances the\nlarge\u2010scale convection electric field. However, the downward\ncurrent is carried by cold ionospheric electrons propagating\nupward [Arnoldy, 1974], which leaves a region typically less\nthan 100 km wide adjacent to the auroral arc where a plasma\ndepletion of 20 to 70% (average 45%) may occur within a\nminute, though it typically takes 5 min to develop [Doe et al.,\n1993, 1995]. The plasma depletion results in a similar\ndecrease in Pedersen conductivity (see equation (2)). Hence\nin order to satisfy current continuity, intense horizontal\nionospheric electric fields, possibly exceeding 100 mV\/m,\npointing into the auroral arc can develop in a narrow region,\npossibly less than 45 kmwide, on the equatorward (poleward)\nKOSCH ET AL.: MESOSCALE POLAR IONOSPHERE VARIABILITY A05321A05321\n3 of 16\nside of auroral arcs in the dusk (dawn) sector [Aikio et al.,\n1993; Fujii et al., 2009; Lewis et al., 1994; Opgenoorth\net al., 1990]. Radar [e.g., McCrea et al., 1991; Stiles et al.,\n1980] and rocket studies [e.g., Evans et al., 1977; Marklund\net al., 1982] have all found that strong Joule heating\noccurred near the boundaries of auroral arcs but was weak\nwithin the aurora itself.\n[10] Codrescu et al. [1995] showed that including electric\nfield variability always increased the estimated Joule heating\nrate compared to using averaged electric fields. Using tem-\nporally and spatially averaged electric fields can result in\n20\u201365% [Rodger et al., 2001] and 50% [Codrescu et al.,\n2000] underestimation of the total Joule heating, respec-\ntively. In addition,Cierpka et al. [2000] showed that ignoring\nthe F region neutral wind when estimating the ionospheric\nelectric field resulted in an error of up to 60% in the F layer\nJoule heating calculation. Aruliah et al. [2004] found that the\nF region neutral wind dynamo was on average 50% of the\nmagnetospheric electric field and contributed an average 41%\nof in situ Joule heating. A similar study has not been done\nin the E layer, although Brekke and Rino [1978] found the\nmaximum in ionospheric Joule heating occurred around 110\u2013\n130 km altitude. Of course, the E region neutral winds can\nsubstantially affect the transfer of energy from the magneto-\nsphere into the ionosphere. Fujii et al. [1999] and Thayer\n[1998] estimated that \u223c35% and \u223c30%, respectively, of the\ntotal energy entering the ionosphere went into accelerating\nthe E region neutral wind and the rest into Joule heating.\nHowever, theE region neutral wind effect is height dependent\nand the neutral winds can also act as a dynamo releasing\nenergy into the thermosphere [Fujii et al., 1999; Thayer,\n1998]. Kosch et al. [2010] showed that mesoscale neutral\nwinds in the upper E region (>128 km) could be dramatically\nchanged by the appearance of auroral arcs. They showed that\nthe neutral winds within \u223c50 km of an auroral arc could rotate\ntheir direction by \u223c90\u00b0 within 7\u201316 min in the height range\n\u223c130\u2013200 km. This was attributed to ion drag as a result of\nthe enhanced electric field and plasma density associated with\nauroral precipitation, which is consistent with Nozawa et al.\n[2005] who found that ion drag became an important force\nabove 107 and 118 km in the auroral oval and polar cap,\nrespectively.\n[11] The Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere\n(CTIP) model [Fuller\u2010Rowell and Rees, 1980; Millward\net al., 1996] consists of a global thermospheric model, a\nhigh\u2010latitude ionospheric model, and a midlatitude and low\u2010\nlatitude ionosphere\/plasmasphere model. The thermospheric\ncode simulates the time\u2010dependent global structure of the\nwind vector, temperature, and density of the neutral ther-\nmosphere by numerically solving the nonlinear equations of\nmomentum, energy, and continuity on a 3\u2010D spherical polar\ngrid rotating with the Earth. The high\u2010latitude ionosphere\nconvection model calculates field\u2010aligned ion velocity com-\nponents from the field\u2010aligned momentum equation. The\nmodel includes chemistry, gravity, and ion\u2010ion and ion\u2010\nneutral collisional drag. The ionosphere is computed self\u2010\nconsistently with the thermosphere poleward of 23\u00b0 latitude\nin both hemispheres. Transport under the influence of mag-\nnetospheric electric fields is explicitly treated, assumingE \u00d7B\ndrifts and collisions with neutral particles. CTIP uses the\nfollowing input parameters: Hemispheric Power (GW) and\nHemispheric Power index (activity level), F10.7 radio flux,\nand ionospheric electric fields obtained from the Weimar\nelectrodynamics model which uses solar wind density and\nvelocity as well as IMF data for input. The model latitude,\nlongitude, and time resolution is 2\u00b0, 18\u00b0, and 72 min,\nrespectively, and the altitude range spans approximately 80 to\n1000 km in 15 logarithmically spaced pressure levels.\nCodrescu et al. [1997] found that a closely related model\n(CTIM) underestimated the global large\u2010scale thermospheric\nneutral temperature compared to measurements during geo-\nmagnetic storms when the average electric field was used for\nJoule heating calculations. However, it is clear that the reason\nfor this discrepancy is because the CTIP\/CTIMmodel neither\nhas the spatial nor temporal resolution to directly model\nmesoscale auroral features. This is true for all current atmo-\nspheric general circulation models.\n[12] The strength of the FAC, ionospheric Joule heating,\nplasma convection, and neutral winds are all increased during\ngeomagnetic activity and auroral substorms and never dis-\nappear completely even during quiet periods [e.g., Aruliah\net al., 1991; Kosch and Nielsen, 1995, 2001; McCormac\net al., 1987; Senior et al., 1990]. It is clear that mesoscale\nobservations of the ionospheric electric field and Pedersen\nconductance as well as the thermospheric neutral winds are\nimportant to the total global energy budget of the magneto-\nsphere\u2010thermosphere system. In the past, such spatial reso-\nlution has not normally been available over a wide field of\nview. We present mesoscale spatial observations of E region\nJoule heating in the vicinity of an auroral arc with unprece-\ndented spatial resolution.\n2. Experiment and Data\n[13] Simultaneous E region observations of neutral wind\nand ion flow in the vicinity of an auroral arc have been\nundertaken using a Scanning Doppler Imager (SCANDI)\n[Aruliah et al., 2010] and the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR)\n[Wannberg et al., 1997], both located at 78.2\u00b0 N, 16.0\u00b0 E in\nthe polar cap near Longyearbyen on Svalbard. SCANDI\nobserved 557.7 nm in the E region with 7 min integration.\nFigure 1 shows the data layout of SCANDI (black solid lines)\nin an all\u2010sky angular format. The field of view is subdivided\ninto 25 sectors within four azimuthal annuli with zenith angles\nof 0\u201316\u00b0 (1 sector), 17\u201344\u00b0 (4 sectors), 45\u201359\u00b0 (8 sectors),\nand 60\u201367\u00b0 (12 sectors). This corresponds to horizontal radial\ndistances at the center of each annulus of 0, 62, 140, and\n218 km at an altitude of 110 km. The colocated traditional FPI\nwas intended to observe 630.0 nm in the F region by pointing\nin the four cardinal directions plus vertical but a technical\nfault resulted in 557.7 nm observations only from this instru-\nment.We therefore have noF region neutral wind observations.\n[14] It was intended that the ESR 32 m dish scan 360\u00b0 in\nazimuth angle at 1.5\u00b0\/s with a constant zenith angle in the\nmiddle of each SCANDI annulus, i.e., at 30, 52, and 64\u00b0 zenith\nangle. The intended dish scan sequence was 360\u00b0 clockwise\nat 30\u00b0 zenith angle, 360\u00b0 anticlockwise at 52\u00b0 zenith angle,\n360\u00b0 clockwise at 64\u00b0 zenith angle, 360\u00b0 anticlockwise at\n52\u00b0 zenith angle, repeated continuously. ESR license restric-\ntions did not permit the 64\u00b0 zenith angle, so the maximum\nzenith angle allowed was used (60\u00b0). To prevent cable wind\u2010\nup because of the odd number of SCANDI annuli, the middle\nannulus was scanned twice in each cycle. During zenith angle\nchanges, set for azimuth = 135\u00b0, the transmitter was to be\nKOSCH ET AL.: MESOSCALE POLAR IONOSPHERE VARIABILITY A05321A05321\n4 of 16\nconnected to the fixed field\u2010aligned 42 m dish to make near\u2010\nvertical observations (field\u2010aligned at 8\u00b0S). The intended\nESR 32 m dish scan is shown in Figure 1 (blue lines). The\nESR was operated using the standard STEFFE1 radar code\nwith range gates from 90 to 1000 km, a range resolution of\n2.4 km and 6.4 s data integration time. Unfortunately, a\nsynchronization error of the azimuth and zenith control of\nthe 32 m dish, as well as the transmitter switching times to\nthe 42 m dish, occurred. Figure 1 shows the ESR measure-\nment locations in 6.4 s increments for a complete scan (red\nsquares). Multiple data from the same position are not obvi-\nous where the dish was stationary, especially for the middle\nannulus. The net result was that the 32 m dish spent too much\ntime at azimuth = 135\u00b0 making multiple observations with-\nout changing zenith angles or switching the transmitter to the\n42 m dish, zenith angle changes took place at incorrect azi-\nmuth angles, and switching the transmitter to the 42 m dish\nresulted in large data gaps in the 32 m azimuth scan\n(approximately one third of each azimuth scan is missing\ndata). To ameliorate the situation, the two highest zenith angle\nscans have been combined, effectively eliminating all ESR\ndata gaps for the middle SCANDI annulus. The effective\nzenith angle for this synthesized ESR annulus is 56\u00b0 with the\noriginal data corrected for the geometry change. The highest\nzenith angle SCANDI data effectively has no ESR data to\naccompany it, thereby reducing the field of view of this study.\nFor the low zenith angle ESR scan, the missing data have\nbeen modeled using the vector fitting algorithm [Anderson\net al., 2009]. Of the total 17.8 min radar scan time, 4 min is\nspent on the 30\u00b0 zenith angle, 12 min is spent on the syn-\nthesized 56\u00b0 zenith angle, and 1.8 min is spent changing\nzenith angle or not scanning. Of course, the 42 m dish field\u2010\naligned data were unaffected.\n[15] Horizontal ion flow fields have been derived from the\nline\u2010of\u2010sight ion velocity data using a similar algorithm to\nthat used to derive the neutral wind fields. This algorithm is\ndescribed in detail by Anderson et al. [2009, and references\ntherein] and is routinely used to generate neutral wind vector\nfields. However, for the ion flow fields the algorithm has been\nmodified to allow for the uneven azimuth sampling resulting\nfrom the dish scan error. Instead of directly calculating the\nFourier coefficients around each azimuthal ring (as is done for\nthe neutrals), these coefficients have been obtained by least\nsquares fitting a sinusoidal function to the azimuthal variation\nof line\u2010of\u2010sight velocity data in each annulus. Each compo-\nnent of the flow field is then described by a first\u2010order Taylor\nexpansion about the zenith, with uniform flow and gradient\nterms given in terms of the fitted Fourier coefficients. As with\nthe neutrals, the assumption of a constant magnetic meridi-\nonal flow field along the magnetic zonal direction has been\nused to constrain the fit. Note that the resulting vector flow\nfields (neutrals and ions) make use only of the fitted com-\nponent normal to the line of sight when line\u2010of\u2010sight data is\navailable at a given position in the sky; thus each fitted vector\nis made up of a directly measured line\u2010of\u2010sight component\nand a fitted normal component, and the derived vector flow\nfields retain anymesoscale variability present in themeasured\nline\u2010of\u2010sight data.\n[16] A significant limitation of the ESR scan is that it took\n17.8 min to complete. This is approximately 2.5\u00d7 longer than\nthe SCANDI integration (7 min). Therefore it was necessary\nto find an aurora that was stationary within the field of view\nfor this length of time. This scenario only occurred approx-\nimately once within the 3 day campaign covering 2, 9, and\n16 February 2010. We analyze an almost\u2010stationary aurora\nfor 2336\u20132354 UT on 2 February 2010. We also investigate\ngeomagnetically quiet periods before (2312\u20132330 UT on\n2 February 2010) and after (0036\u20130054 UT on 3 February\n2010, hereafter labeled 2436\u20132454 UT) the aurora appeared.\nHere 2312\u20132330 UT had no aurora present and 2436\u2013\n2454 UT had some quiet aurora present near the southeast\nhorizon. All periods are used for mesoscale Joule heating\ncalculations. Only the last period is used for estimating the\nE region ion\u2010neutral collision frequency using equation (8).\nGeomagnetic conditions were moderately active with Kp =\n3\u20134 in the period of interest. The IMF data from the ACE\nsatellite in GSM coordinates, adjusted by 48 min to account\nfor the solar wind speed of \u223c520 km\/s, gives Bz in the range\n\u22125.9 to +2.8 nT, By in the range \u22122.2 to \u22126.0 nT and Bx in\nthe range +0.1 to +4.6 nT throughout the period of interest.\nSuperDARN global ionospheric convection (not shown)\nshows Longyearbyen under a weakly developed dawn con-\nvection cell, consistent with Bz mostly positive and By neg-\native. There are no SuperDARN backscatter data directly\nover Longyearbyen; however, weak eastward convection is\nobserved over the northern Scandinavian sector.\n[17] Inverting the plasma density profiles obtained from the\nESR field\u2010aligned 42 m dish gave the effective 557.7 nm\nemission altitude to be in the range 105\u2013117 km with an\naverage of 110.5 km during the periods of interest [Link and\nCogger, 1988; Vlasov et al., 2005]. From equation (9), this is\nconsistent with auroral precipitation of 3\u201310 keV [del Pozo\net al., 1997]. The CTIP model has low temporal resolution\n(72 min.) but comparing modeled and observed neutral\nFigure 1.

The ESR 32 m data was\nbinned into 22.5\u00b0 azimuthal sectors and height integrated for\n105\u2013115 km in the E region and 200\u2013300 km in the F region,\nthe latter primarily to obtain the ionospheric electric field.\nUnfortunately, the nighttime E region plasma density in the\npolar cap during solar minimum was so low in the absence\nof aurora (<2 \u00d7 1010 el\/m3) that the radar observations have\nlow signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio. However, expanding the E region\nheight range beyond one scale height (\u223c10 km) was con-\nsidered undesirable. Increasing the integration time is not\npossible because of the continuous 32 m dish motion. How-\never, when the aurora appeared the plasma density was \u22655 \u00d7\n1010 el\/m3. The situation in the F layer is significantly better\nbecause of the higher plasma density and 100 km height\nintegration. Hence we are unable to use the E region ion\ntemperature data to provide an accurate cross\u2010check of the\n557.7 nm emission altitude estimate. The E region neutral\ntemperature, averaged over the entire field of view, is \u223c375\u2013\n415 \u00b1 5 K during the period of interest and is consistent with\nthe ion temperature in the same height range. Our observa-\ntions agree well with previous ESR ion temperature obser-\nvations [Maeda et al., 2002, 2005] obtained without beam\nscanning and employing longer integration times. The low\nneutral temperature variability indicates a relatively constant\n557.7 nm emission altitude. The ESR plasma density and\nvelocity observations were usable throughout the experiment.\nDuring the periods of interest, the field\u2010aligned ion velocity\nwas < 65 m\/s while the vertical E region neutral wind was <\n20 m\/s. Therefore along with the almost\u2010stationary aurora,\nthe conditions for obtaining the equivalent horizontal ion\nflow in the E and F regions, and neutral flow in the E region,\nwere reasonably met.\n[18] Figure 2 shows the fitted horizontal ESR ion velocities\n(yellow) and SCANDI neutral velocities (blue) overlaid on an\naveraged all\u2010sky image in geographic coordinates. The green\nvectors at low zenith angle are modeled data to close the ESR\ndata gaps (described above). Each vector is centered on its\nlocation. Note the different vector scales for each data type.\nFigures 2a, 2b, and 2c show the spatial distribution of\nF region ion flow in 22.5\u00b0 sectors for 30 and 56\u00b0 zenith angle\nat 2312\u20132330, 2336\u20132354, and 2436\u20132454 UT, respectively.\nFigures 2d and 2e show the spatial distribution of E region\nion flow in 22.5\u00b0 sectors for 30 and 56\u00b0 zenith angle at\n2336\u20132354 and 2436\u20132454 UT, respectively, for 105\u2013115 km\naltitude. Overlaid are the E region neutral wind vectors, one\nfor each SCANDI sector. The E region ion and neutral flow\ndata for 2312\u20132330 UT are not shown because of the low\nplasma density and optical emission intensity from the lack\nof particle precipitation, which resulted in low ESR and\nSCANDI data signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratios. An unfiltered all\u2010sky\ncolor camera recorded optical images of the sky every 3 min\nusing 2 min integration. The arithmetic mean of the appro-\npriate images was taken to form a single image for each of the\nthree selected study periods (each of \u223c18 min duration) to\ndemonstrate that the aurora is either absent or present and near\nstationary. The white dotted arcs in the images are due to\nthe moving stars. The yellow illumination on the northwest\nhorizon is stray light from a neighboring instrument dome.\nNote that the figures are in angular coordinates, so the F layer\ndata does not overlay the E layer data directly. Likewise, the\nlocation of the F region ion flow vectors does not relate well\nto that of the aurora.\n[19] The geometry of the experiment has the low zenith\nangle annulus in the F region vertically above the high zenith\nangle annulus in the E region, which coincides with the\nmiddle annulus of E region neutral winds from SCANDI. The\nmagnetic field inclination over Svalbard is only \u223c8\u00b0, i.e.,\neffectively vertical. Figure 3 shows a schematic vertical cut\nradially through the data presented in Figure 2. The figure\nis approximately to scale. The ESR beam directions are\nrepresented by solid arrows at 30\u00b0 and 56\u00b0 zenith angle. The\nSCANDI sector boundaries are represented by dashed arrows\nat 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 zenith angle. For the height range 105\u2013115 km,\nthe synthesizedE region ESR data at 56\u00b0 zenith angle covers a\nradial distance of 156\u2013170 km, whereas the SCANDI sector\nat 45\u201360\u00b0 zenith angle covers 110\u2013190 km. We denote the\neffective radial distance of the combined data as 163 km. This\ngives an azimuthal distance of 64 km for the 22.5\u00b0 sectors.\nThe F region ESR data at 30\u00b0 zenith angle intersects the\nmiddle annulus SCANDI sector boundaries at 190\u2013329 km\naltitude, which conveniently allows integration over 200\u2013\n300 km in the F layer to obtain a good estimate of the iono-\nspheric electric field from equation (4). Unfortunately, the\nF region neutral winds are unknown. However, since we\nFigure 3. A schematic vertical cut radially through the ESR\nscan space. The plot is approximately to scale.

The latter were integrated over 95\u2013145 km altitude.\nThe altitude is 74 and 128 km at the SCANDI sector bound-\naries, i.e., 110 and 190 km radius, respectively. Hence for the\nhigher altitudes up to 145 km, the ESR data unavoidably\nextends beyond the SCANDI sector boundary (by \u223c25 km).\nIt was not possible to extend the conductance calculation\nto higher heights, with 145 km altitude corresponding to a\nrange of 260 km, because the ESR reached its detection limit.\nIncreasing the integration time from 2 \u00d7 6.4 = 12.8 s is\nnot feasible because of the continuous dish motion. Hence\nalthough the absolute Pedersen conductance and therefore\nJoule heating values will be too low, their relative values\nwill remain correct. Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c show the spa-\ntial distribution of Pedersen conductance in 22.5\u00b0 sectors\nabout Longyearbyen for 2312\u20132330, 2336\u20132354, and 2436\u2013\n2454 UT.

Clearly, the auroras partly inter-\nsect with some of the ESR\u2019s data, which came from greater\nranges than indicated by the data sectors (as discussed above).\nTable 1 gives the Pedersen conductance, electric field, Joule\nheating, and E region neutral temperature for each sector,\nwith average uncertainties of 4.3%, 19.3%, 35.8%, and\n0.7% over all the study periods. The average uncertainty for\neach time period is given in Table 1. The average value and\nmaximum percentage change is also given for each time\nperiod.

Since the ion\u2010\nneutral collision frequency emerges from a vector calculation,\nit can be done independently for orthogonal components [cf.\nDavies et al., 1997]. This has been done referring to the east\u2010\nwest (black) and north\u2010south (green) neutral wind compo-\nnents as well as the vector magnitudes (red) and angles (blue)\nseparately before averaging. The ion\u2010neutral collision fre-\nquency is in the range 424\u2013450 Hz (average 438 Hz) with an\nuncertainty of 36% (\u00b179 Hz). The average uncertainty in the\nF region ion flow is 19%, and in the E region ion and neutral\nflow uncertainties are 16% and 29%, respectively. The\naverage neutral wind uncertainty is greatest because there\nare fewer vectors (i.e., larger sectors) over the entire sky than\nion flow vectors. Figure 6 also shows the ion\u2010neutral collision\nfrequency from equation (3) (dotted line) and ion cyclotron\nfrequency (dashed line) with altitude. These are equal at\n\u223c119 km altitude. The ion\u2010neutral collision frequency cal-\nculation could not be done for 2312\u20132330 UT, prior to when\nthe aurora appeared, due to a lack of suitable ion and neutral\nflow data (signal too low). Applying equation (8) during\n2336\u20132354 UT, when the aurora was present around much\nof the horizon, resulted in many unrealistic, including some\nnegative, values. This may be due to the time taken for the\nESR to complete a scan for not perfectly stationary aurora as\nwell as 557.7 nm height variations due to the obvious struc-\nture of the aurora. Even for 2436\u20132454 UT, which corre-\nsponds to a quiet period with aurora present only on the south\nand southeast horizon (see Figures 2c and 2e), it was not\npossible to extract the ion\u2010neutral collision frequency from\nindividual 45\u00b0 sectors corresponding to the SCANDI data\nbecause the uncertainties become very large without aver-\naging over the entire sky.\n[22] The raw data measurement uncertainties for the ESR\nare obtained from the GUISDAP incoherent backscatter\nspectrum\u2010fitting algorithm [Lehtinen and Huuskonen, 1996].\nThe same is true when extracting basic parameters from the\nSDI data [cf. Anderson et al., 2009]. However, when calcu-\nlating physical parameters such as Joule heating (equation (1)),\nPedersen conductance (equation (2)), and ion\u2010neutral collision\nfrequency (equation (8)), the uncertainty (d) for a physical\nparameter (f) is estimated by propagating the uncertainties of\nthe measured input data (x, y,\u2026) by using df\n2 = (\u2202f \/\u2202x)2 \u00b7 dx2 +\n(\u2202f\/\u2202y)2 \u00b7 dy2 + \u2026. We have assumed zero uncertainty for\nmodeled input data (e.g., geomagnetic field from IGRF and\nneutral density from MSIS). The Pedersen conductance cal-\nculation uses an estimate of the electron\u2010neutral collision fre-\nquency, which requires knowledge of the electron temperature.\nHowever, owing to the high uncertainty in the ESR\u2010derived\ntemperature data, which is a direct result of the low plasma\ndensity in the E layer, we have used MSIS values of neutral\ntemperature instead of the measured electron temperatures.\nThis approach is justified in the lower E region for quiet geo-\nmagnetic conditions. We have not used the SDI measurement\nof the neutral temperature because this is effectively valid for\none altitude only.\n3. Results and Discussion\n[23] Figure 2a for before the appearance of the aurora\nshows an empty sky overhead, except for some aurora on the\nsoutheast horizon. Figures 2c and 2e for after the appearance\nof the aurora also show essentially an empty sky overhead,\nexcept for some aurora on the southern and southeast horizon.\nFigures 2b and 2d are for the most stable period of aurora and\nshow optical emissions stretching across most of the northern\nsky and part of the southwest horizon. The F region ion flow\nwas equatorward during 2312\u20132330 UT (Figure 2a), giving\na westward electric field, turned eastward when the aurora\nappeared during 2336\u20132354 UT (Figure 2b) and remained\neastward with reduced strength after the aurora mostly dis-\nappeared during 2436\u20132454 UT (Figure 2c), giving an\nequatorward electric field of the dawn convection cell, as\nFigure 6.

The ESR F region flows and their changes are\nconsistent with SuperDARN ionospheric convection (not\nshown). We do not believe that the aurora changed the\nF region ion flow direction when it appeared; it is more likely\nthat this is merely coincidence. The E region ion flow is\nmostly southeastward and the neutral flow mostly eastward\n(Figures 2d and 2e). These are consistent with each other.\nThere is no dramatic change after the aurora disappears. We\ndo not have reliable E region ion and neutral flow data prior\nto the appearance of the aurora. Hence it is not possible to\ndetermine whether either changed their direction with the\nappearance of the aurora, as has been reported by Kosch et al.\n[2010] for the E region neutral winds. We note that the\nF region ion flows have larger amplitude than E region ion\nflows, which in turn have larger amplitude than the E region\nneutral winds, which is expected. Perhaps surprisingly, the\nrotation of the E region ion flows toward the electric field\ndirection, i.e., 90\u00b0 clockwise to the F region ion flow, is not\nvery apparent for 2336\u20132354 UT (Figure 2d). In the lower\nE region, a \u223c45\u00b0 rotation relative to the F region is expected\nwhere the ion\u2010gyro and ion\u2010neutral collision frequencies are\napproximately equal [cf. Brekke et al., 1990; Brekke, 1997].\nThis is apparent for 2436\u20132454 UT (Figure 2e). According\nto Figure 6, this condition occurs at \u223c119 km over Long-\nyearbyen, which is nevertheless above our height estimate\nof 112.8 \u00b1 0.8 km for this time period. The modest angle\nbetween F and E region ion flow indicates that a neutral wind\nis present in the E region flowing approximately parallel to\nthe F region ion flow. Figures 2b and 2d, as well as Figures 2c\nand 2e, show this to be the case. A small angle between F and\nE region ion flow can also indicate a lower than expected\nneutral density, which is feasible given our late winter\nnighttime experiment toward the end of solar minimum and\nis consistent with satellite observations [e.g., Emmert et al.,\n2010; Heelis et al., 2009].\n[24] The neutral temperature data given in Table 1 show a\nmaximum variation of 22% around the analysis annulus for\nboth 2336\u20132354 and 2436\u20132454 UT, indicating that the\neffective height variation of the 557.7 nm emission over\n360\u00b0 was probably low and reasonably well constrained\nwithin one scale height (\u00b15 km) of 110 km altitude. However,\nthere are some possible localized issues with the aurora not\nbeing entirely stationary. For example, in Figure 2d, near the\nnorth\u2010northwest horizon there is a patch of brighter aurora\nthat corresponds to an E region ion flow vector not pointing\nin the same general direction as its neighbors. There is also\na faint aurora near the zenith in the southwest sector of\nFigure 2d, which may account for the discontinuity in low\nzenith angle ion flow south of zenith. In Figure 2e, there is\na faint aurora present between the ESR data rings in the\nsouthwest quadrant, which may explain the sudden change in\ndirection of E region ion flow in the high zenith angle ion\nflow. Such problems are unavoidable and we have chosen the\nbest available time periods for the analysis. In addition, there\nare potential temporal ambiguity issues associated with the\nslowness of the radar scan cycle (17.8 min). This is particu-\nlarly clear in Figure 2b where the average ion flowmagnitude\nfor the high and low zenith angle azimuthal ESR scans do not\nappear equal. A reason that the two data rings may have\nsystematic differences is that the uniform flow component is\ncalculated separately in each ring when performing the vector\nfit. Unlike the partial derivatives, which are averaged across\nboth rings, the uniform background flow term is allowed to\nvary between rings. This is explained in detail by Anderson\net al. [2009]. The situation is somewhat exacerbated in this\ncase study by the radar not following the intended dish scan\npattern. However, when combining F and E region data, the\nslow radar scan is not quite as serious as it may initially seem.\nWe use the inner ESR data ring for the F region ion flow,\nwhich takes 4 min to scan, and the outer ESR data ring for\nE region ion flow, which takes 12 min to scan. However,\nE region flow is less variable over time simply due to the\nhigher density of the neutrals.\n[25] Figures 4a and 5a show low Pedersen conductance\n(average 0.52 S) and Joule heating (average 0.63 mW\/m2),\nrespectively, despite the relatively high electric fields (aver-\nage 32.6 mV\/m, see Figure 2a) for 2312\u20132330 UT. This\nis consistent with very low auroral precipitation. Figures 4b\nand 5b show high Pedersen conductance (average 2.79 S)\nand Joule heating (average 4.13 mW\/m2), respectively, along\nwith high electric fields (average 38.1 mV\/m, see Figure 2b).\nThis is consistent with the presence of the auroral arcs driving\na Pedersen current through the ionosphere [e.g., Aikio et al.,\n1993; Lewis et al., 1994; McCrea et al., 1991]. We note\nthat the sectors of particularly enhanced Pedersen conduc-\ntance and Joule heating in the northwest and southwest cor-\nrespond to the presence of the aurora. Figures 4c and 5c show\nhigh Pedersen conductance (average 1.98 S) and low Joule\nheating (average 0.81 mW\/m2), respectively, along with low\nelectric fields (average 19.8 mV\/m, see Figure 2c). Again,\nthis is consistent with the postaurora situation. Using the\nglobal average empirical formulas for Joule heating by\nKosch and Nielsen [1995], Kp = 3 and 4 corresponds to 3.33\nand 5.83mW\/m2, respectively.While this is in agreement with\nour averaged data when the aurora is present (4.13 mW\/m2),\nthe empirical formulas can clearly never reproduce any\nmesoscale variations. The discrepancy would be less had\nwe been able to integrate the Pedersen conductance above\n145 km altitude but not enough to explain the difference.\n[26] The CTIP model predicts that we capture 72% of the\ntotal Pedersen conductance by cutting off the integration at\n145 km. Hence our Pedersen conductance and Joule heating\nvalues should be increased by 28% to be more realistic,\nat least according to CTIP. We do this in order to compare\nour observations with the CTIP model prediction. For 2312\u2013\n2330 UT we observe an adjusted average of 0.67 S and\n0.81 mW\/m2 and CTIP predicts 4.45 S and 1.22 mW\/m2. The\nJoule heating agrees reasonably well but the conductance\ndoes not. Our lower conductance measurement is consistent\nwith no auroral precipitation. For 2336\u20132354 UT we observe\nan adjusted average of 3.57 S and 5.29 mW\/m2 and CTIP\npredicts 3.02 S and 1.13 mW\/m2. The conductance agrees\nreasonably well but the large Joule heating discrepancy\nbetween observation and model is largely due to the fact that\nthe model cannot take into account the local auroral precip-\nitation. In fact, CTIP predicts less conductance and heating\nduring the aurora than before its appearance, which is clearly\nincorrect. For 2436\u20132454 UTwe observe an adjusted average\nof 2.75 S and 1.13 mW\/m2 and CTIP predicts 3.53 S and\n0.067 mW\/m2. Here the model predicts a lower heating\nrate after the aurora mostly disappears, which is correct, but\na higher conductance, which is incorrect. Again, the dis-\nKOSCH ET AL.: MESOSCALE POLAR IONOSPHERE VARIABILITY A05321A05321\n12 of 16\ncrepancy between model and observation is large for Joule\nheating. It is clear that the model cannot reproduce the\nobservations because it does not have the resolution to\naccount for mesoscale variability nor can it account for\nlocalized auroral precipitation.\n[27] The main point here is the variability of the Joule\nheating, not its absolute value. For variability comparison\npurposes only, we exclude those data sectors for which\nthe ESR was pointing into the aurora at 2336\u20132354 and\n2436\u20132454 UT, i.e., the six northernmost sectors and the two\nsouthwest sectors in Figure 5b and four southeastern sectors\nin Figure 5c, closest to the aurora. In Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c,\nJoule heating varies by 308%, 90%, and 269%, respectively,\nover 360\u00b0 with respect to the average. This variation is\nlarge compared to the average measurement uncertainty of\n35.8% (see Table 1). Bearing in mind that it takes 30 s to scan\ntwo neighboring sectors, the largest change in Joule heating\nbetween any pair of neighboring sectors is 278%, 47%, and\n201% with respect to the average in Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c,\nrespectively. It is clear that current ionosphere\u2010thermosphere\nmodels cannot replicate this variability due to their low spatial\nand temporal resolution (e.g., CTIP, 2\u00b0 latitude, 18\u00b0 longi-\ntude, 72 min). The consequence of this is illustrated by the\ntotal power dissipated in our analysis annulus, covering 110\nto 190 km radius (see Figure 3). The total area covered by the\nannulus is 7.54 \u00d7 1010 m2 and by each 22.5\u00b0 sector is 4.71 \u00d7\n109 m2. Using the average electric field and Pedersen con-\nductance, the total power dissipated is 4.16 \u00d7 107, 3.05 \u00d7 108,\nand 5.82 \u00d7 107 W for Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c, respectively.\nHowever, if we integrate the power dissipated in each sector,\ngiving the same total area, then the total power dissipated is\n4.74 \u00d7 107, 3.12 \u00d7 108, and 6.10 \u00d7 107 W for Figures 5a, 5b,\nand 5c, respectively. This means that the total power dis-\nsipated, when integrated over smaller sectors, results in a\n13.9%, 2.3%, and 4.8% increase for Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c,\nrespectively. Perhaps surprisingly, the discrepancy is smallest\nwhen the electric field and conductance is high (Figures 2b\nand 4b) and greatest for low conductance and high electric\nfield (Figures 2a and 4a). Of course, the Pedersen conduc-\ntance and electric field are coupled as higher Pedersen con-\nductance tends to short out the electric field. While we cannot\ndraw a general conclusion from this one case study, it seems\nclear that large\u2010scale spatial averaging results in the under-\nestimation of energy dissipation, which is consistent with\nCodrescu et al. [1995, 2000] and Rodger et al. [2001] find-\nings, although the discrepancy for our case study is within\nthe measurement uncertainty for Joule heating (35.8%). From\nour experiment it is not possible to determine the smallest\nsector size that would give an accurate determination of the\ntotal power dissipated because reducing the sector size results\nin increased measurement uncertainty. However, it is prob-\nably less than our sector size of 64 km. From this case study,\nit seems clear that current thermosphere\u2010ionosphere models\ncannot possibly accurately determine the total power dissi-\npated in the upper atmosphere as none can achieve mesoscale\nresolution.\n[28] The ion\u2010neutral collision frequency shown in Figure 6\nhas an average value of 438 Hz, whereas equation (3) predicts\n471 Hz at 112.8 km altitude using the MSIS model, a\ndiscrepancy of 33 Hz which is within the measurement\nuncertainty (\u00b179 Hz). The predicted ion\u2010neutral collision\nfrequency varies rapidly with altitude in the E region,\nchanging by almost an order of magnitude within one scale\nheight (\u223c10 km). To get good agreement, our altitude estimate\nof the 557.7 nm emission would have to be \u223c113.2 km, which\nis entirely feasible given our measurement uncertainty of\n\u00b10.8 km. The \u00b179 Hz uncertainty in the ion\u2010neutral collision\nfrequency estimate corresponds to a height range of about\n1 km around 113 km according equation (3), i.e., much less\nthan one scale height. Since our height estimate is 112.8 \u00b1\n0.8 km, it appears that our observational estimate of the\nE region ion\u2010neutral collision frequency is good agreement\nwith that derived from MSIS. However, an unquantified\nsource of uncertainty is the effect of the F region neutral\nwinds on our ionospheric electric field estimate. The appli-\ncation of equations (3) and (8) offers the possibility to make\nmesoscale measurements of neutral density. Given the obser-\nvations of large and sustained vertical neutral winds [e.g.,Price\net al., 1995;Rees et al., 1984; Smith, 1998], often in association\nwith auroral activity and Joule heating, it seems probable that\nthe neutral composition and density should be variable near\nauroral arcs. Future observations are needed to study this.\n[29] There is no doubt that the slowness of the radar scan is\na fundamental limitation for this experiment. However, with a\nsingle dish radar, there are few options. Even if increasing the\nscan rate were possible, the integration time per sector would\ndecrease resulting in lower signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio of the data.\nGiven the mechanical speed and high zenith angle pointing\nlimitations of the ESR, a future experiment should only have\nazimuthal scans at two zenith angles, thereby reducing the\ntotal scan time to \u223c9 min for the mesoscale Joule heating\nestimate and avoiding the cable wind\u2010up problem. In addi-\ntion, the passive SDI observations mean that experimenters\nhave no control over the effective height of the data in the\nE layer, which will always be determined by the energy of the\nauroral precipitation producing the 557.7 nm emission (see\nequation (9)).\n4. Conclusion\n[30] Using a novel dish scan mode on the EISCAT\nSvalbard radar, combined with all\u2010sky E region neutral wind\nobservations from a scanning Doppler imager, we have made\nmesoscale observations of ion and neutral flow, partly in the\nvicinity of an auroral arc, within the polar cap at \u223c110 km\naltitude. We show that Joule heating can vary by >100%\nwithin 64 km horizontal distance. It is clear that current\nionosphere\u2010thermosphere general circulation models are far\nfrom realizing such mesoscale variability, which probably\naccounts for at least part of their underestimation of the ion-\nosphere\u2010magnetosphere energy coupling budget. We also\nperform the first estimate of the E region ion\u2010neutral collision\nfrequency at 112.8 (\u00b10.8) km altitude by combining E and\nF region ion flow with E region neutral flow data. Our result\nis in good agreement with the ion\u2010neutral frequency derived\nfrom the MSIS atmospheric model.\n[31] Acknowledgments.
