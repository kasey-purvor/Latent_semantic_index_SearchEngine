Introduction\nThe tumour microenvironment is significantly different from\nthat of normal tissue; its chaotic vasculature leads to a decrease in\nsupply of essential nutrients and a decrease in the removal of\nwaste products. One biomarker that has received much attention\nis tumour hypoxia (poor oxygenation). Near-zero oxygen levels are\nobserved at distances of only 150mm from a feeding blood vessel\n(Thomlinson and Gray, 1955; Gatenby and Gillies, 2004). As such,\nareas of hypoxia are commonplace within tumours. Identifying\nthe regions of hypoxia within tumours has been a focus of recent\nresearch, as cells residing within such regions are known to be\nresistant to various radio- and chemo-therapeutic strategies.\nMoreover, cells subjected to chronic hypoxia are found to be\nmore aggressive, displaying increased metastasis, invasion and\nmutation (Gillies et al., 2002).\nAcidity also plays a key role in tumour development. Like\nhypoxia, regions of low pH are commonplace within tumours.\nMoreover, the effects of acidosis are similar to those of hypoxia,\nwith acidosis promoting metastasis, invasion and mutation\n(Gillies et al., 2002). However, unlike hypoxia, there has been\nrelatively little research into acidity as a factor for promoting\ntumour development. The reasons for this are unclear; it may be\nthat many investigators assume that the acidity is simply a\nbyproduct of low oxygen levels. Cells respond to periods ofll rights reserved.\n: +441613065201.\nuk (K. Smallbone).hypoxia by converting to anaerobic respiration, or glycolysis,\nwhich in turn produces lactic acid and brings about lower tissue\npH. However, the work of Warburg early in the last century\n(Warburg, 1930) showed that the increased reliance on glycolysis\nto produce energy in many aggressive tumours occurs even in the\npresence of sufficient oxygen. As such, tumour acidification is an\nintrinsic property of both poor vasculature and altered tumour\ncell metabolism, and occurs independently of hypoxia.\nIn an earlier work (Smallbone et al., 2005), we developed a\nsimple model of (spherically symmetric) tumour growth to\nexamine the role of acidosis in the interaction between normal\nand tumour cell populations. Assuming that a mass of tumour\ncells displays typical characteristics of increased acid production\ncoupled with a resistance to low pH, we predicted that the\nhydrogen ions produced by the tumour will diffuse into the\nsurrounding normal tissue, inducing cellular death. Thus acidity\nprovides a simple mechanism for cancer invasion. Both vascular\nand avascular tumour dynamics were investigated, and a number\nof different potential behaviours arose. Whilst an avascular\ntumour always proceeds to a benign steady state, a vascular\ntumour may display either benign or invasive dynamics, depend-\ning on the value of a critical bifurcation parameter. The model also\npredicted the development of an experimentally observed\nacellular gap separating the advancing tumour and receding host\ntissue fronts (Gatenby and Gawlinski, 1996).\nIn this paper, we extend the previous model through the\ninclusion of quiescent (non-proliferating) tumour cells. Within\navascular tumours, in particular, the vast majority of viable cells\nare quiescent, with active cells restricted to the nutrient-rich\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nK. Smallbone et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 255 (2008) 106\u2013112 107outer rim. These quiescent cells are essentially metabolically\ninactive, producing significantly less acid than their proliferating\ncounterparts. By considering both active and quiescent cells, we\ngive a more physiologically accurate description of the acidity in\nand around the tumour tissue. Moreover, the interfacial gap is\npredicted to be an order of magnitude smaller than the tumour\nradius at equilibrium, in line with experimental evidence.2. Model development\nWemodel the tumour as a sphere of radius RM and assume that\nspherical symmetry prevails at all times. Let H denote the\nextracellular concentration of excess hydrogen ions, where excess\nmeans above its normal level of 10\u00027:25 M \u0003 pH 7:25. We assume\nthat there is a sharp acid threshold concentration HD above which\ntumour cells cannot survive. Similarly, normal cells die when this\nconcentration H rises above HN . Tumour cells are relatively\nresistant to extracellular acidity due to increased Na\u00fe=H\u00fe antiport\nactivity and mutations in acid-induced apoptosis pathways, hence\nHN5HD. High levels of acidity can also induce tumour cells to\ncease proliferation, i.e. become quiescent (Casciari et al., 1992).\nSpecifically, acidosis promotes the production of hypoxia induci-\nble factor 1 (HIF-1); via a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27,\nHIF-1 acts to inhibit the cell cycle (Goda et al., 2003; Murphy et al.,\n2004). Hence we assume that there also exists a sharp acidity\nthreshold HQ above which tumour cells cease proliferation.\nThese assumptions typically lead to a tumour geometry as\npresented in Fig. 1. Necrotic tissue is located at the core of the\ntumour RoRD. Within the viable region RDoRoRM , the active\nproliferating tumour cells are restricted to the outer rim\nRQoRoRM , whilst the region RDoRoRQ contains quiescent cells.\nEach of the radii are defined by the acid levels at their\nboundary\u2014H\u00f0Ri\u00de \u00bc Hi, for i \u00bc D;Q ;N. We define the acid produc-\ntion rate fQ per cell for quiescent cells and fA for active cells,\nwhere fQ5fA as quiescent cells are essentially metabolically\ninactive, producing significantly less acid than proliferating cellsR2\nTumour\nNormal\nRD\nRQ\nRM\nRN\nFig. 1. Cross-section of a tumour and its surrounding tissue showing the central\nnecrotic core, RoRD , a layer of quiescent tumour cells RDoRoRQ , a layer of\nproliferating tumour cells RQoRoRM , the acellular gap separating normal and\ntumour cell fronts RMoRoRN , and the normal cells RNoR.(Casciari et al., 1992). The primary mode for removal of acid from\nthe system is through blood vessels and we assume that this\noccurs at a rate rV proportional to the local acid concentration and\nlocal blood vessel density.

These\ncompounds flow into the surrounding tissue and the cell volume\nlost in this way is replaced by cells pushed inward through surface\ntension forces.

(2001), we take \u0002 \u00bc 0:01\u2014i.e. the rate of\nacid production of quiescent tumour cells is two orders of\nmagnitude less than their proliferating counterparts.\nIt can be argued that the various simplifying assumptions\nabove are too unrealistic to represent complex biological\nphenomena such tumour growth. For example, whilst radial\nsymmetry holds for early tumour growth, during later develop-\nment tumours often become asymmetric; indeed the degree of\nirregularity of the tumour boundary may provide clinicians with\nuseful prognostic information (Cross et al., 1994). Moreover,\napoptosis and necrosis are dependent on a wide range of\nenvironmental parameters besides acidity, with subpopulations\nof a heterogeneous tumour responding differently to each cue.\nHowever, the aim of this paper is to highlight the role of acidity;\nunder our assumptions the model remains analytically tractable\nand allows us to fully understand general tissue dynamics. These\neffects can subsequently be included in more complex models\nwhere analysis is not possible, such as Smallbone et al. (2007a).2.1. Avascular and vascular tumours, no quiescence\nIn an earlier work (Smallbone et al., 2005), we investigated\nEqs. (3)\u2013(5) in the absence of quiescence (i.e. hQ \u00bc hD), but we\nreiterate the results here for completeness. Two cases were\nconsidered, both an avascular tumour \u00f0c \u00bc 0\u00de and a vascular\ntumour whose blood vessel density was the same as that found in\nnormal tissue \u00f0c \u00bc 1\u00de.\nIn the avascular case, a benign two-phase growth pattern is\nobserved. Initially, the tumour grows exponentially, without a\nnecrotic core. At a critical radius, a necrotic core begins to develop\nand the second phase of tumour growth begins. During this phase,\nwe see very little change in tumour size. However, the necrotic\ncore grows rapidly towards its equilibrium value. A similar growth\npattern is observed in the vascular case when hDo1, and is\npresented in Fig. 2; here we see formation of a necrotic core at\nradius rM \u00bc 0:53 (RM \u0005 1mm) before the tumour reaches a final\nsize of rM \u00bc 0:8 (RM \u0005 1:7mm). If this critical parameter hD41,\nhowever, the vascular tumour will display invasive exponential\ngrowth, without the formation of a necrotic core.0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\nTime \u03c4\nR\nad\niu\ns \nr\nrN\nrM\nrD\nFig. 2.

Avascular tumours with quiescence\nIn this section, we extend the previous model through the\ninclusion of quiescent tumour cells, focussing first on avascular\ntumour growth (i.e. c \u00bc 0), as this case is more amenable to\nanalysis.

(7)\nAssuming that acidity is the sole cause of necrosis and quiescence\nwithin the tumour allows us to calculate the radii of the necrotic\ncore, rD, and the quiescent region, rQ , as functions of the tumour\nouter radius, rM . While the tumour consists of only active\nproliferating cells (i.e. rD \u00bc rQ \u00bc 0), from Eq. (6) we have\nh\u00f00\u00de \u00bc r\n2\nM\u00f0rM \u00fe 3\u00de\n6\u00f0rM \u00fe 1\u00de\n\u0002!1 as rM !1. (8)\nThus at some critical value rM \u00bc r^M , h\u00f00\u00de \u00bc hQ , and the cells at the\ncentre of the tumour will become quiescent. This critical radius is\nfound by solving\nc1\u00f0r^M\u00de \u00bc r^3M \u00fe 3r^2M \u0002 6hQ r^M \u0002 6hQ \u00bc 0. (9)\nThe positive solution r^M is given by Eq. (24), taking n \u00bc 0.\nIf rM4r^M , then a quiescent region exists, and its radius rQ may\nbe found by noting that the acid concentration at its boundary\nwill be h\u00f0rQ \u00de \u00bc hQ :\nc2\u00f0rQ ; rM\u00de \u00bc 2\u00f01\u0002 \u0002\u00der3Q \u0002 \u00f03\u0002 2\u0002\u00de\u00f0rM \u00fe 1\u00der2Q \u00fe c1\u00f0rM\u00de \u00bc 0. (10)\nThe solution in rQ is given by Eq. (24), choosing n \u00bc 2.\nIf \u000240, then we find that acidity will increase at the tumour\nboundary as it grows. Eventually all tumour cells will become\nquiescent, and the radius r^Q at which this occurs may be found\nthrough solution of Eq.

If\nhDoh\u0007, however, at some critical value rM \u00bc r^D, h\u00f00\u00de \u00bc hD and the\ncells at the centre of the tumour will become necrotic. From\nEq.

(24), taking n \u00bc 0.\nIf rM4r^D, then a necrotic core exists and its radius is given by\nnoting that h\u00f0rD\u00de \u00bc hD:\nc3\u00f0rD; rQ \u00de \u00bc 2r3D \u0002 3rQ r2D \u00fe \u00f0r2Q \u0002 r2\u0007\u00derQ \u00bc 0. (15)\nThe solution in rD is found using Eq. (24), taking n \u00bc 2.\nFurthermore, we know that h\u00f0rQ \u00de \u00bc hQ :\nc4\u00f0rD; rQ ; rM\u00de \u00bc rQc2\u00f0rQ ; rM\u00de \u0002 2\u0002\u00f01\u00fe rM \u0002 rQ \u00der3D \u00bc 0. (16)\nGiven rM , we may numerically find rQ 2 \u00f0rD; rM\u00de from Eq. (16),\nusing the expression for rD in Eq. (15).\nThe set of equations above allows calculation of the non-\ndimensional quiescent tissue radius, rQ , and the necrotic core\nradius, rD, for any value of outer radius rM . These radii may then be\nused to determine tumour growth from Eq. (5). Assuming that, at\ntime 0, the tumour is small enough that there is no necrotic\ncore or quiescent region (i.e. rD \u00bc rQ \u00bc 0), then the system is\ncompletely defined by Eqs. (5), (15) and (16), relying on\nparameters \u0002, g, hD, hQ and the initial condition rM\u00f00\u00de.\nExamples of the growth patterns observed are given in Fig. 3.\nUsing typical parameter estimates of hD \u00bc 0:1 and hQ \u00bc 0:04,\nhDoh\u0007 and so we see a three-phase growth. Initially, the tumour\ngrows exponentially, whilst all cells are proliferative. At the\ncritical radius rM \u00bc r^M , the central tissue becomes quiescent,\nrestricting the active cells to a thin outer rim (Fig. 3(a)). At a later\nstage, when rM \u00bc r^D, we see the development of a necrotic core,\nfollowed by convergence of the tumour to its equilibrium size\n(Fig. 3(b)), behaviour typically seen in multicellular spheroids\ngrown in vitro. In Fig. 3(c), we increase the tumour\u2019s susceptibility\nto acid-induced quiescence, taking hQ \u00bc 0:01, equivalent to pH\n6.8. In this case, hD4h\u0007, and no necrotic core will develop. Rather,\nit slowly grows to its equilibrium size rM \u00bc r^Q where all the\ntumour cells are quiescent. This description of a quiescent tumour\nwith no necrosis corresponds to a typical benign growth such as\nan adenoma.\nWe move on now to the acid-mediated invasion of normal\ntissue, and the corresponding development of an acellular gap\nseparating the advancing tumour and receding host tissue fronts.\nThe normal tissue front rN is defined by the relationship h\u00f0rN\u00de \u00bc\nhN i.e. k6e\n\u0002rN=rN \u00bc hN , which has solution\nrN \u00bcW0\nk6\nhN\n\u0003 \u0004\n, (17)\nwhere W0 denotes the principal value of the Lambert W (or\nproduct log) function\u2014the inverse function of f \u00f0W\u00de \u00bcWeW\n(Corless et al., 1996).\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nK. Smallbone et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 255 (2008) 106\u2013112110In Fig. 3(b), we see that in necrotic growth, the layer of\nproliferating cells forms a very thin layer at the edge of the\ntumour, hence we may approximate rM \u0005 rQ at equilibrium. In\nnon-necrotic growth (c), there are no proliferating cells at\nequilibrium, hence rM \u00bc rQ . In both cases, we may assume that\nh\u00f0rM\u00de \u0005 h\u00f0rQ \u00de \u00bc hQ . Then, from Eqs.

We see that\nEq. (19) represents a good approximation to the gap size o. Most\nimportantly, through comparison of Figs. 3 and 4, we see that the\nequilibrium tumour width is predicted to be approximately 10\ntimes as large as the interfacial width. This is significantly more\nphysiologically accurate than the basic model (see Fig. 2), where\nthe gap was predicted to be of a similar size to the tumour. Indeed,\nif we take the steady state tumour radius rM \u00bc r^Q from Eq. (11),\noccurring in non-necrotic growth, and the approximate value for\no in Eq.

Vascular tumours with quiescence\nAll of the analyses presented above are inherently reliant on\nthe property that acidity levels increase as one moves toward the\ncentre of the tumour. However, in the case of a vascularized\ntumour where we consider the effects of quiescence, this may not\nbe the case, and the tumour may not adopt the typical geometry\npresented in Fig. 1.\nIndeed in Smallbone et al. (2007b), we examined a simplified\nversion of Eq. (3), ignoring the effects of necrosis (i.e. rD \u00bc 0, or\nequivalently hD !1).

This implies that the typical\nassumption of temporal homogeneity is not valid, and instead the\nfull dynamics must be considered.\nIn the absence of necrosis, we may reformulate Eqs.

Taking s0 \u00bc 0:5,\nequivalent to a lag of t0 \u0005 30min, we investigate how acidity\nlevels vary through the tumour. The model predicts that cycles of\nacidity will be seen: high levels of acidity induce cells to cease\nproliferation. Quiescent cells produce significantly less acid than\ntheir proliferating counterparts, thus the level of acidity will\ndecrease, allowing cells to resume proliferation.\nInitially, all the cells within the tumour are below the\nquiescence threshold. Cycles of acidity are out of phase for\ndifferent sections of the tumour and an increase in acidity is first\nseen at the tumour edge \u00f0r \u00bc 1\u00de. Acidity then increases at the\ntumour centre \u00f0r \u00bc 0\u00de, before reaching its maximum level. This\nfigure demonstrates that, whilst acid levels are on average higher\nin the tumour centre than the tumour edge, this property does not\nhold for all points in the acid cycle. Indeed the first cells to become\nquiescent due to extracellular acidity are not at the tumour\ncentre; rather this occurs at r \u0005 0:81 near the edge of the tumour.\nFluctuations in metabolite levels are known to occur within\ntumours with discrete periodicities of hours, minutes and days\n(Baudelet et al., 2004; Braun et al., 1999).

Smallbone et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 255 (2008) 106\u2013112 111selected by somatic evolutionary forces. These cycles are assumed\nto occur due to h\u00e6modynamic variations such as changes in the\nlocal concentration of red blood cells or structural rearrangement\nof blood vessels (Gatenby and Gillies, 2004). We have shown that\nan alternative hypothesis, namely quiescence in response to\ncellular stress and the corresponding drop in metabolism,\nprovides a negative feedback mechanism capable of reproducing\nsuch metabolite cycles.3. Discussion\nIn this paper, we have presented a selection of models of both\nvascular and avascular tumour growth, where the invasion\nmechanism is the acidification of the microenvironment sur-\nrounding the tumour due to increased reliance on glycolysis. A\nmajor criticism of an earlier model was that the width of the\ninterfacial acellular gap was predicted to be of a similar size to the\ntumour, larger than has been observed experimentally. Within\navascular tumours in particular, the vast majority of the viable\ncells are quiescent, producing significantly less acid than their\nproliferating counterparts. As such, we extend the basic model to\ninclude the effects of quiescent, as well as proliferating and\nnecrotic tumour cells.\nAnalysis of the avascular model predicts two regimes of\ntumour growth, dependent on a relationship between the\nthresholds for acidity-induced tumour cell quiescence hQ and\ntumour cell death hD. If the tumour is sufficiently resistant to\nacid-induced cell death, we predict that no necrotic core will\ndevelop, and the tumour will grow to a state containing only\nquiescent tissue. Conversely, if the resistance hD drops below a\ncritical threshold h\u0007, we predict that, at equilibrium, the\nproliferative tumour tissue will be limited to a thin, relatively\nalkaline, region at the tumour edge, whilst the core of the tumour\nwill contain necrotic material. At steady state, proliferation at the\nrim is counterbalanced by volume loss through degradation of the\nnecrotic core.\nIn both cases, we predict that the advancing tumour front is\nseparated from the receding normal tissue by an acellular gap. In\ncontrast to earlier work, we find that the gap width is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the tumour radius at equilibrium. A\nsimple functional approximation (Eq. (19)) allows us to calculate\nthe expected width of this gap in terms of the tumour radius, the\ntumour tissue quiescence threshold \u00f0hQ \u00de and the host tissue death\nthreshold \u00f0hN\u00de.\nAs blood vessels are the primary mode for waste removal,\nwithin avascular tumours we see a build-up of acid, limiting\ngrowth through auto-toxicity. To demonstrate sustained growth,\ntumours must acquire a vascular bed; if the vascular density rises\nsufficiently, the tumour avoids excess acid accumulation and may\ninvade the whole of the normal tissue space. However, the\nintroduction of quiescence into the model adds an interesting new\ndynamic: cycles of acidity may be observed in the tumour.\nPreviously, variations in substrate levels were assumed to occur\nthrough oscillations in the h\u00e6modynamics of nearby and distant\nblood vessels. Within our modelling framework, quiescent cells\nproduce less acid than their proliferating counterparts. Through\nvascular removal, acidity levels decrease, in time allowing cells to\nresume proliferation. This simple negative feedback mechanism is\nshown to produce the observed cycles in tumour substrate levels.\nSimple reaction\u2013diffusion systems are used here to describe\nthe dynamics of acidity in and around a tumour. Tumour growth\nis dependent on the complex interactive dynamics of many\ndifferent factors, including the supply of nutrients and growth\nfactors and the specific mutations displayed by the tumour\npopulation. Moreover, inhomogeneities can play an importantrole, and stochastic or cellular automaton models (Patel et al.,\n2001; Smallbone et al., 2007a) may be more appropriate than the\nmean-field approach used here. However, using simplifying\nassumptions we have shown that increased tumour acid produc-\ntion alone, almost universally observed in clinical cancers, is\nsufficient to explain a variety of behaviours; these include benign\nand invasive development, an interstitial gap separating the\ntumour and host tissue fronts, and cycles of acid levels driven\nby cellular quiescence. Moreover, the tractability of the model has\nallowed us to identify the key parameters controlling the change\nbetween different growth regimes.Acknowledgements\nKS acknowledges the support of the BBSRC\/EPSRC Grant BB\/\nC008219\/1 \u2018\u2018The Manchester Centre for Integrative Systems\nBiology (MCISB)\u2019\u2019.
