This study describes the onset process of auroral\nsubstorms in connection with the vertical evolution of auroral\nparticle acceleration, on the basis of auroral kilometric radia-\ntion (AKR) dynamics. We show that the auroral acceleration\nprocess at substorm onset basically consists of two stages:\n(1) appearance\/intensification of a low-altitude acceleration\nregion at 4000\u20135000 km accompanied by initial brighten-\ning and (2) breakout of high-altitude field-aligned accelera-\ntion above the pre-existing low-altitude acceleration region at\n6000\u201312 000 km, which is followed by auroral breakup and\npoleward expansion. It is also revealed that this two-stage\nevolution of auroral acceleration corresponds to the two-step\nreinforcement of field-aligned current.\nKeywords. Magnetospheric physics (Auroral phenomena;\nMagnetosphere-ionosphere interactions; Storms and sub-\nstorms)\n1 Introduction\nIt has been widely accepted that auroral breakup and the re-\nlated sharp negative bay are caused by auroral electron beams\nand field-aligned current (FAC), respectively (e.g. Akasofu,\n1968; McPherron et al., 1973). They are driven in the field-\naligned acceleration region at substorm onset. Thus, a sud-\nden build-up of the field-aligned acceleration is essential to\nthe onset of the magnetospheric substorm. Although the lati-\ntudinal and longitudinal development of an auroral substorm\nhas been investigated on the basis of observations from the\nCorrespondence to: A. Morioka\n(morioka@pparc.geophys.tohoku.ac.jp)\nground and space (e.g. Elphinstone et al., 1996, and refer-\nences therein), the dynamic behavior of auroral acceleration,\nespecially its vertical evolution at substorm onset, is not well\nunderstood, except for statistical features of the field-aligned\nauroral acceleration region drawn from in-situ observations\nby rocket and satellite (e.g. Evans, 1974; Mozer et al., 1977;\nErgun et al., 2002).\nRemote observation of AKR is a useful tool for detect-\ning the dynamics of the auroral acceleration region (Kaiser\nand Alexander, 1977; Morioka et al., 1981; Liou et al.,\n1999; Hanasz et al., 2001; Janhunen et al., 2004). Re-\ncently, Morioka et al. (2007, 2008) derived the features of\nthe sudden build-up process of field-aligned acceleration at\nsubstorm onset from remote AKR observations. A sudden\nexpansion of the AKR spectra, typically from 30 to 800 kHz\nat substorm onset, was defined as AKR breakup. This fre-\nquency range corresponds to the altitude range of the AKR\nsource (roughly from 16 000 to 2000 km) because the AKR\nradiates at the local electron cyclotron frequency along auro-\nral field lines. Furthermore, the range of the AKR source can\nbe roughly regarded as equivalent to that of the acceleration\nregion because AKR is the result of wave-particle interaction\nwith electron beams in the acceleration region (e.g. Ergun et\nal., 1998; Pottelette et al., 2001).\nThe onset of the magnetospheric substorm was first de-\nfined by Akasofu (1964) as the sudden brightening of the\nauroral arc (T =0\u20135 min) followed by rapid poleward mo-\ntion (T =5\u201310 min) on the basis of ground-based all-sky cam-\nera observations. Subsequently, the terms \u201csubstorm on-\nset\u201d, which means the start of a magnetospheric substorm,\nand \u201cbreakup\u201d, which means the start of an auroral sub-\nstorm in the ionosphere, have been commonly used in sub-\nstorm studies. However, the definitions of these terms are\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n526 A.

Sometimes the term \u201cinitial brightening\u201d is used as a\nsynonym for \u201cbreakup\u201d and\/or \u201csubstorm onset\u201d. Voronkov\net al. (2003) described three steps in auroral substorm devel-\nopment on the basis of a typical substorm event: intensifica-\ntion of 557.7-nm emission following cross-tail electric-field\npulsation, breakup characterized by poleward expansion and\nPi2 pulsation, and expansive phase onset followed by fast\npoleward expansion of energetic electron precipitation.\nThe steps in the evolution of auroral substorms could be\nsignificant manifestations of the magnetospheric substorm\nonset process that have not yet achieved a common under-\nstanding (e.g. Ohtani, 2004; Angelopoulos, 2008). The M-I\ncoupling process in the course of substorm onset is an impor-\ntant element of this issue. The field-aligned acceleration in\nthe M-I coupling region plays a key role in the dynamic con-\nnection of the near earth plasma sheet and the auroral onset\nsite in the ionosphere. In this paper we describe the auroral\nsubstorm process in connection with the vertical evolution of\nthe field-aligned acceleration by investigating the dynamic\nbehavior of AKR sources at substorm onset. Four typical\nsubstorm events are analyzed in detail.\nWe used AKR observations by the Polar satellite. Po-\nlar Plasma Wave Instrument (PWI) observations (Gurnett et\nal., 1995) provide high-time resolution data for the electric\nfield up to 800 kHz, which enabled analysis of the verti-\ncal structure of the M-I coupling region and its dynamics\nat substorm. Polar Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) data (Torr et\nal., 1995) were used to examine global auroral development\nduring substorms. Geomagnetic pulsation data from auro-\nral (from WDC, NIPR), sub-auroral (from SAMNET), and\nlow-latitude (from Kakioka Observatory through WDC, Ky-\noto University) stations were used to identify substorm onset.\n2 Observations\n2.1 AKR breakup and substorm\nFigure 1a shows a color-contoured spectrogram of AKR in\nthe frequency range from 30 to 800 kHz for 30 min on 7 Jan-\nuary 1997. Banded AKR in the 300 to 500 kHz appeared\nfrom the beginning of the frequency-time spectrogram (f\u2212t\ndiagram), and the AKR suddenly expanded at \u223c11:52 UT.\nSince AKR is generated at the local electron cyclotron fre-\nquency along the auroral field lines, the AKR frequency can\nbe converted into the source altitude along the field lines.\nFigure 1b shows the topside down spectrogram of panel (a)\nin which the vertical axis is a linear plot with respect to the\nAKR source altitude along the L=7 field line; that is, it is\nan altitude-time (a\u2212t) diagram of the AKR source. Using\nthis plot, we can discuss the AKR source dynamics along\nthe magnetic field lines which corresponds to the temporal\nevolution of the field-aligned acceleration. A rather stable\n\u201clow-altitude AKR\u201d appeared from 3000 to 5000 km. Al-\nmost simultaneously with the low-latitude Pi2 pulsation on-\nset at Kakioka (L=1.3, midnight (MLT)=15:04 UT) around\n11:52 UT (Fig. 1c), a new AKR source appeared explo-\nsively at a higher altitude (7000\u201316 000 km). This new AKR\nsource was not a simple extension of the pre-existing low-\naltitude AKR but an independent evolution at the higher alti-\ntude. We call it \u201chigh-altitude AKR\u201d, and the term \u201cAKR\nbreakup\u201d is defined as the sudden appearance of a new\nAKR source above the pre-existing low-altitude AKR source.\nAKR breakup suggests the abrupt formation of a new high-\naltitude field-aligned acceleration region at substorm onset.\nIt should be noted that AKR spectra provide no information\non the horizontal distribution of AKR sources and related ac-\nceleration regions, although AKR radiates above the auroral\noval.\nThe low-altitude AKR is emitted from the inverted-V type\nacceleration region, which is quasi-static and surrounds the\nAnn.

Morioka et al.: Vertical evolution of auroral acceleration at substorm onset 527\nauroral latitudes above the auroral oval (e.g. Frank and Ack-\nerson, 1971), because the emission shows a close relationship\nwith the oval activity (Morioka et al., 2007). On the other\nhand, the high-altitude AKR is emitted at the local onset site\nof the auroral substorm because the emission was simultane-\nously observed with the auroral expansion (Morioka et al.,\n2007, 2008).\nFigure 2 illustrates the detailed relationship of AKR evo-\nlution and ground-based ULF pulsation. Panel (a) shows the\na\u2212t diagram of AKR for 15 min on 16 April 1996. AKR\nbreakup occurred around 23:13 UT (indicated by the verti-\ncal rectangle), with an explosive growth in intensity (up to\n1000 times) within 30 s and an expansion to an altitude of\n6000 to \u223c12 000 km. The moment of AKR breakup would\nbe the instant when the local onset site in the auroral iono-\nsphere is connected to the magnetosphere through a sud-\ndenly formed parallel acceleration region. For 2 to 3 min\nprior to the breakup, the low-altitude AKR showed grad-\nual intensification from \u223c23:10 UT. Apparently, increasing\nlow-altitude AKR is a necessary condition to ignite the high-\naltitude AKR.\nThe mid-latitude magnetogram at Kvistaberg (L=3.3, mid-\nnight (MLT)=21:50 UT) is shown in panel (b) of Fig. 2. Pi2\npulsation appeared simultaneously with the AKR breakup\naround 23:13 UT. Panel (c) shows the pulsation (dH\/dt) data\nat auroral station, Tjornes (L=6.4). Around this time, Tjornes\nwas at a premidnight location (midnight (MLT)=23:45 UT).\nThe dH\/dt signal began to negatively decrease (quasi-DC\nvariation) almost simultaneously with the gradual intensi-\nfication of the low-altitude AKR. This negative excursion\nof the derivative of the geomagnetic H-component (d\/dt\n(dH\/dt)<0) suggests an exponential increase in the westward\nelectrojet current in the ionosphere, which was likely induced\nby the exponential increase in the upward FAC.\nFigure 2d and e shows shorter period components (period\nof 2\u201310 and 10\u201320 s, respectively) of the Tjornes pulsation.\nThe fluctuations gradually increased in amplitude (blue ar-\neas in panels (d) and (e)) starting almost simultaneously with\nboth the start of negative excursion of dH\/dt and the gradual\nintensification of the low-altitude AKR. A hodograph of the\nT =2\u201310 s component before 23:12:30 UT (not shown) indi-\ncated no polarization characteristics, so it can be concluded\nthat these short period components were not hydromagnetic\nwave but were associated with the fluctuating component of\nthe increasing FAC. It is noteworthy that the amplitude of\nthis noise component increased dramatically immediately af-\nter the AKR breakup (beige area in panels d and e). This may\nbe a manifestation of a current flowing rapidly into the iono-\nsphere. This two-step increment of the FAC derived from the\ndH\/dt data was confirmed from the variation in the geomag-\nnetic H-component. The H-component at Tjornes showed an\nexponential decrease before the AKR breakup and a rapid\nfall after the AKR breakup, as shown in the bottom panel of\nFig. 2.\n16000\n14000\n12000\n10000\n  8000\n  6000\n  4000\n  2000S\nou\nrc\ne \nA\nlti\ntu\nde\n (k\nm\n) @\n L\n=7\n16 April 1996    23:05 - 23:20 \n UT    23:05                               23:10                               23:15                                23:20\nKvistaberg  L=3.3\nH\n-c\nom\np.\n - \nnT\n 4\n 0\n-4\n 1\n 0    \n-1\n 1\n 0\n-1\n1080\n1076\n1072\ndH\n\/d\nt -\n A\nrb\nitr\nar\ny \nU\nni\nt\nTjornes  L=6.4\nPolar \/ PWI\n-12                   -14                   -16                  -18\nAKR Intensity [V2 m-2 Hz-1]\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nTjornes  (T=2-10 sec)\nTjornes  (T=10-20 sec)\n     0\n-100\n-200\n-300H\n-c\nom\npo\nne\nnt\n - \nnT Tjornes  Ordinary Magnetogram\n(H-component)\n10               10               10               10\nFig. 2Fig. 2.

(2000). The\ntop panel is a sequence of nightside (18:00\u201306:00 MLT) UV\nauroral images from Polar\/UVI. The images were obtained\nby a combination of Lyman-Birge-Hopfield long (LBHL)\nand short (LBHS) filters in the wavelength range 140\u2013\n180 nm. The narrow blue horizontal bar under each panel\nindicates the exposure time. The faint arc around 65\u201367\u25e6\nmagnetic latitude in the premidnight sector (image (i)) devel-\noped into a \u201csudden brightening\u201d (Liou et al., 2000) between\nimages (ii) and (iii). The second panel shows the ULF data\nat Kakioka. Long period oscillation began at\u223c16:38 UT and\nbecame strong after 16:41 UT. From these auroral and ULF\nsequences, Liou et al. (2000) defined the \u201ccommencement\nof auroral substorm\u201d at 16:38:51 UT\u00b141 s (horizontal green\nrectangle in panel b) and Pi2 onset at \u223c16:41:34 UT (green\narrow in panel b).\nThe evolution of the field-aligned acceleration for this sub-\nstorm is shown by the a\u2212t diagram of AKR source in the\nbottom panel of Fig. 4. Low-altitude AKR (centered at about\n3000 km) appeared at \u223c16:41 UT (vertical blue rectangle in\npanel) and gradually enhanced the power. The start time of\nthis low-altitude AKR is between that of the \u201csudden bright-\nening\u201d and \u201cPi2 onset\u201d defined by Liou et al. (2000). In the\ncourse of the enhancement, the AKR breakup occurred at\n16:44 UT ranging in altitude from 5000 to 9000 km, com-\npleting the explosive growth in power within 30 s (vertical\nbeige rectangle).\nFigure 4c and d shows the band-pass filtered compo-\nnents (T =30\u201340 and 50\u201360 s, respectively) of pulsation at\nKakioka. The longer period (50\u201360 s) component showed\ntwo significant rises around 16:40 UT (roughly concur-\nrent with the appearance of low-altitude AKR) and around\n16:44 UT (almost simultaneous with AKR breakup). The\nshorter period (30\u201340 s) component, on the other hand,\nshowed a distinct enhancement around 16:44 UT. These in-\ndicate that the original wave form of the irregular pulsa-\ntion (panel b) was a superposition of a new Pi2 pulsa-\ntion at 16:44 UT on the pre-existing one that started around\n16:40 UT, and that the first and second Pi2 pulsations are\nclosely related with the appearance of low-altitude AKR and\nAKR breakup, respectively.\nIt should be noted, looking again at the top panel of Fig. 4,\nthat the AKR breakup was almost simultaneous with the dis-\ntinct auroral intensification that accompanied the poleward\nexpansion (image (vi) in the panel). This suggests that the\nstrong intensification and poleward expansion of the onset\narc is not a simple activation of the previous auroral activity\nbut is associated with a catastrophic change (sudden build-up\nof the high-altitude acceleration region) in the M-I coupling\nregion. The time sequence for the 29 December substorm is\nsummarized later (Fig. 7a).\nAnother example of substorm onset on 3 April 1996\nis shown in Fig. 5. This substorm event has also al-\nready been described by Liou et al. (1999). They used\na method to objectively evaluate the development of auro-\nral luminosity and determined a \u201csudden auroral brighten-\ning\u201d at 15:31:20 UT\u00b118 s (indicated by the green rectangle\nin panel b) by using the start of the increase in the area-\nintegrated auroral luminosity. This brightening can also be\nrecognized from raw UV image (image (ii)) in panel (a). Fol-\nlowing the gradual and continuous evolution of this bright\nregion in intensity and in longitude (images (iii), (iv), and\n(v)), a violent intensification of auroral brightness with pole-\nward expansion occurred in the pre-midnight sector around\n15:35:48 UT (image (vi)). Subsequently, this auroral activity\ndeveloped into a global substorm expanding to both the pole-\nward and post-midnight regions (image (viii) and thereafter).\nFigure 5b shows low-latitude Pi2 pulsation at Kakioka.\nThe onset time, determined by Liou et al. (1999), was\n15:32:07 UT (indicated by the green arrow). Figure 5c and\nd shows the band-passed components; the pass-bands were\nT =20\u201330 and 40\u201350 s, respectively. The band-passed com-\nponents showed that they rose twice before 15:37 UT, that is,\nthe Pi2 event at Kakioka was a superposition of two onsets\nof irregular pulsations that began around 15:32 UT (first Pi2)\nand 15:35 UT (second Pi2).\nFigure 5e is the a\u2212t diagram of AKR source for the pe-\nriod of interest. Low-altitude AKR appeared from 3000 to\n4000 km at around 15:32 UT (vertical blue rectangle) and\ngradually intensified. The start time of the low-altitude AKR\nwas roughly concurrent with both the \u201csudden auroral bright-\nening\u201d and the \u201conset of the first Pi2\u201d defined by Liou et\nal. (1999). Around 15:35:30 UT, the AKR broke up with ex-\nplosive growth in the altitude range from 4000 to 8000 km\n(vertical beige rectangle). Note that this AKR breakup,\nAnn.

Low-altitude AKR appeared\naround 16:41 UT (blue vertical rectangle), and high-altitude AKR appeared around 16:44 UT (beige vertical rectangle).\nwhich means the sudden connection of a certain region in the\nplasma sheet to the local onset site in the ionosphere through\nthe field-aligned acceleration region, was almost simultane-\nous with the auroral intensification\/poleward expansion (im-\nage (vi) in panel a) and the second Pi2 onset at Kakioka.\nAfter 15:37 UT, there happened two AKR breakup accompa-\nnying two Pi2 pulsations, reflecting the multiple onset sub-\nstorm. The sequence of the phenomena before 15:38 is sum-\nmarized in Fig. 7b.\n3 Discussion\nOn the basis of the dynamic behavior of AKR, the vertical\nevolution of the auroral acceleration region was investigated\nin connection with the global development of auroral sub-\nstorms. Four typical substorm events were analyzed in detail.\nThe sudden build-up of the high-altitude acceleration at sub-\nstorm onset was derived from the AKR breakup. The AKR\nsource region at the breakup expanded in the altitude range\nfrom 6000 to 12 000 km on average and showed explosive\ngrowth of power up to 1000 times within 30 s. The breakout\nof the high-altitude acceleration was always accompanied by\nlow-latitude Pi2 pulsation. The low-altitude acceleration re-\ngion, which appeared\/intensified 1\u20135 min prior to the break-\nout of the high-altitude acceleration, was identified from the\nhigh-frequency AKR band (250\u2013350 kHz), for which the al-\ntitude ranged from 4000 to 5000 km on average. This accel-\neration region would correspond to the inverted-V accelera-\ntion region located along the auroral oval (e.g. Lin and Hoff-\nman, 1979) and is formed through the interaction between\nthe magnetospheric and ionospheric plasmas (Knight, 1973;\nChiu and Schultz, 1978).\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/525\/2009\/ Ann.

Low-altitude AKR appeared\naround 15:32 UT (blue vertical rectangle), and high-altitude AKR appeared around 15:35 UT (beige vertical rectangle).\nThe low-altitude AKR described in this paper may be\nexplained by either of two possible categories of electron\nacceleration. The first is the large-scale quasi-static field-\naligned electric field that has been discussed as a self-\nconsistently formed electrostatic potential structure due to\nthe anisotropic magnetospheric plasma distribution, such as\nquasi-static double layers (e.g. Block, 1972; Ergun et al.,\n2004), electrostatic shocks (e.g. Swift, 1975), and the mag-\nnetic mirror process (e.g. Chiu and Schulz, 1978). The other\ncategory is the Alfve\u00b4nic acceleration in which electrons are\naccelerated by Alfve\u00b4nic perturbations though the ionospheric\nresonator (e.g. Lysak and Song, 2003; Ergun et al., 2006; Su\net al., 2008). Short-burst AKR and Jovian S burst are ex-\nplained though this process (Ergun et al., 2006; Su et al.,\n2008). Which acceleration is essential or more effective at\nsubstorm onset is still unclear at this time.\nThe evolution of the high-altitude acceleration is in-\ndependent of the low-altitude acceleration because the\nAnn.

Morioka et al.: Vertical evolution of auroral acceleration at substorm onset 531\nhigh-altitude AKR spectra show a separate development\nfrom that of the pre-existing low-altitude AKR. It should\nbe, however, noted that the high-altitude AKR is ignited in\nthe course of the gradual intensification of the low-altitude\nAKR as shown in Fig. 6. The figure shows power evolutions\nof low- and high-altitude AKR for the four substorms rep-\nresented in this study. The upper and lower traces of each\npanel show the time-profile of the height-integrated AKR\npower for the high-altitude and low-altitude AKR, respec-\ntively. The vertical arrows indicate AKR breakup. Note that\nAKR breakups were ignited when the low-altitude AKRs\nwere increasing and almost reaching something like their\nsaturation level. From these features, it is suggested that\nthe growth of the low-altitude acceleration is a necessary\ncondition for the breakout of the high-altitude acceleration.\nThis also leads to an inference that the increasing FAC along\nthe inverted-V potential (low-altitude acceleration region)\ninduced the current driven instability (Kindel and Kennel,\n1971) in the local M-I coupling region which would develop\ninto the high-altitude acceleration region. Another possible\nhigh-altitude acceleration process may be the Alfve\u00b4nic one,\nwhich accelerates superthermal electrons at substorm, as ob-\nserved by FAST and IMAGE satellites (Mende et al., 2003a,\nb).\nThe FAC evolution around onset was derived from the\ndH\/dt and H-components of the geomagnetic field in the au-\nroral region. It showed a two-step increment corresponding\nto the evolution of the field-aligned acceleration. The first\nstep, which was characterized by an exponential increase\nin westward electrojet current, was almost concurrent with\nthe appearance\/intensification of the low-altitude accelera-\ntion and continued until the breakout of the high-altitude ac-\nceleration. The increasing FAC carried short period dH\/dt\nsignals, which are attributed to the fluctuation component of\nthe increasing FAC. The second step, the start of which was\ncharacterized by a steep fall in the magnetic H-component\nstarting with large amplitude dH\/dt fluctuations, was accom-\npanied by the sudden build-up of the high-altitude acceler-\nation. This sudden change in FAC suggests a rapid current\nflow into the ionosphere that diverged from the tail-current\ndisruption region in the near earth plasma sheet (e.g. Lui,\n1996).\nComparison of UV aurora images with AKR development\nrevealed an important connection between the space-time de-\nvelopment of the auroral substorm and the vertical evolu-\ntion of the auroral acceleration during the substorm. Fig-\nure 7 summarizes the time sequence of the onset processes\nfor the substorm events depicted in Figs. 4 and 5. The hor-\nizontal length of each arrow indicates the ambiguous time\nspan to determine the start time of each phenomenon. The\n\u201csudden auroral brightening\u201d, defined from the UV images,\nis roughly concurrent with the appearance\/intensification of\nthe low-altitude accelerations (within 1\u20132 min). This means\nthat so-called \u201csudden auroral brightening\u201d is not the re-\nsult of abruptly formed auroral acceleration but is enhance-\n(d) 3 April 1996\n(b) 16 April 1996\n(c) 29 December 1996\n8000-10,000 km\n4000-6000 km\n6000-8000 km\n2000-3500 km\n6000-8000 km\n3000-5000 km\nS\npe\nct\nra\nl P\now\ner\n (V\n\/m\n)2\nS\npe\nct\nra\nl P\now\ner\n (V\n\/m\n)2\nS\npe\nct\nra\nl P\now\ner\n (V\n\/m\n)2\nS\npe\nct\nra\nl P\now\ner\n (V\n\/m\n)2\n8000-14,000 km\n3000-4500 km\n(a) 7 January 1997\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n-10\n-12\n-14\n-12\n-14\n-11\n-13\n-15\n-11\n-13\n-15\n-11\n-13\n-15\n-13\n-15\n-11\n-13\n-15\n-11\n-13\n-15\n11:45                     11:50                     11:55\n23:05                     23:10                     23:15                    23:20\n16:35                     16:40                    16:45                     16:50\n15:30                     15:35                    15:40                     15:45   \nFig. 6.

Horizontal\narrows indicate time tolerance for determining start time of each substorm step.\nwith the appearance\/intensification of the pre-existing low-\naltitude acceleration surrounding the nightside oval (Morioka\net al., 2007).\nBy \u201csudden\u201d, we mean a time scale of \u201cwithin 30 s\u201d, con-\nsidering the growth time of AKR breakup (less than 30 s,\nsee vertical arrows in Fig. 6) in this paper. In this sense,\nthe start of the so-called \u201csudden auroral brightening\u201d and\n\u201cappearance\/intensification of low-altitude acceleration\u201d is\nnot always \u201csudden\u201d. The \u201csudden auroral brightening\u201d is\nsometimes rather gradual, as seen in Fig. 4a and Fig. 5a.\nThe \u201cappearance\/intensification of low-altitude acceleration\u201d\nshows gradual rise as shown in Fig. 6 in which horizontal ar-\nrows indicate the start of low-altitude AKR intensification.\nWe thus propose using the term \u201cinitial brightening\u201d rather\nthan \u201csudden brightening\u201d to describe the start of an isolated\nauroral substorm (as illustrated by the bottom left arrow in\neach panel of Fig. 7). The start time of these phenomena is\nthe time when they exceed the instrument threshold. Given\nthese considerations, a time lag of 1\u20132 min between the ini-\ntial brightening of the aurora and the start of the low-altitude\nAKR, as shown in Fig. 7, is not essential for understand-\ning substorm evolution but may be an apparent time delay\n(Kepko and McPherron, 2001).\nThe strong auroral intensification accompanying the pole-\nward expansion after the initial brightening is directly re-\nlated to the breakout of the high-altitude acceleration (AKR\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 525\u2013535, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/525\/2009\/\nA. Morioka et al.: Vertical evolution of auroral acceleration at substorm onset 533\nbreakup), as illustrated in Fig. 7. Although there remains\nan ambiguity of 1\u20132 min related to the time difference be-\ntween the intensification and poleward expansion due to the\nobservational sequence of UVI, it can be strongly suggested\nthat the suddenly built high-altitude acceleration region ex-\npands immediately poleward. This is consistent with that\nthe poleward edge of the auroral bulge is associated with in-\ntense electron precipitation and upward FAC, accompanied\nwith field-aligned acceleration region (Fujii et al., 1994). The\nepoch of strong auroral intensification and poleward expan-\nsion is consistent with the \u201cbreakup characterized by pole-\nward expansion and Pi2 pulsation\u201d defined by Voronkov et\nal. (2003). The term \u201cbreakup\u201d is appropriate for describing\nthis phase of an auroral substorm (as illustrated by the bottom\nright arrow in each panel of Fig. 7).\nIt is interesting to note that the precursor-like phase before\nauroral breakup (between initial brightening and breakup)\nmay correspond to pseudo breakup. That is, pseudo breakup\nmay be the case when enhanced low-altitude AKR (ini-\ntial brightening) is not followed by AKR breakup (auroral\nbreakup and poleward expansion). If that is the case, the\nbuildup of high-altitude acceleration divides substorms be-\ntween substorm onset and pseudo breakup. The confirmation\nof this implication is future work.\nThe association of AKR breakup with auroral breakup and\npoleward expansion indicates that the sudden evolution of the\nhigh-altitude field-aligned acceleration abruptly connects the\nlocal onset site in the ionosphere with a certain area in the\nplasma sheet, and consequently suggests that the local M-I\ncoupling region plays an essential role in igniting the auroral\nbreakup. This suggestion is very interesting in connection\nwith the indication by Lyons et al. (2002) based on their de-\ntailed study of the substorm breakup arc that \u201cthe process that\ninitiates the onset of substorm does not require the occur-\nrence of plasma sheet changes, significant enough to affect\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere electrodynamics\u201d.\nThe low-latitude pulsation sometimes responds twice to\na substorm. The first time is around the initial brightening\nand\/or the start of the low-altitude acceleration intensifica-\ntion (Fig. 7a and b). This pulsation is not always observed or\nis very weak at low latitudes as seen in Fig. 1, where a typi-\ncal Pi2 pulsation is accompanied by only the breakup of the\nhigh-altitude AKR (Morioka et al., 2008). The reason may\nrelate to the nature of the initial brightening, which some-\ntimes shows a gradual evolution, as described above. The\nsecond response is almost concurrent with the breakup ac-\ncompanied by poleward expansion and is common in a sub-\nstorm. Thus, the low-latitude Pi2 pulsation is generally ex-\ncited at two important phases of an auroral substorm: \u201cinitial\nbrightening\u201d and \u201cbreakup\u201d. The differences in the origin\nand driving force between these Pi2 pulsations are still un-\nclear.\nThere has been a long discussion about what process is\nessential for triggering a substorm in connection with the\nplasma dynamics around the plasma sheet inner boundary.\nThe in-situ observations around the inner plasma sheet have\nproposed substorm-related plasma dynamics, such as high\nspeed earthward plasma flow and its braking (e.g. Shiokawa\net al., 1998), resultant inertia current (e.g. Haerendel, 1992),\nexplosive growth phase (Ohtani et al., 2000), tail current dis-\nruption and dipolarization (e.g. Lui, 1992), buildup of sub-\nstorm current system and substorm current wedge (e.g. Aka-\nsofu, 2003; McPherron et al., 1973), and Pi2 pulsation ex-\ncitation (e.g. Kepko et al., 2004). Our investigation of the\nvertical evolution of the field-aligned acceleration and re-\nlated FAC at substorm onset would provide new insights into\nthe substorm onset process and contribute to the study of the\ncausality between the plasma dynamics in the plasma sheet\nand auroral substorms through the M-I coupling process.\n4 Conclusion\nThe vertical evolution of the auroral acceleration region was\ninvestigated in connection with the global development of\nauroral substorms. The investigation showed that the auroral\nacceleration process at substorm onset basically consists of\ntwo steps. The first step is the appearance\/intensification of\nthe low-altitude acceleration region at an altitude of 4000\u2013\n5000 km, which induces the initial brightening accompany-\ning the exponential increase in the upward FAC 1\u20135 min be-\nfore the formation of a high-altitude acceleration region. The\nsecond step is the breakout of the high-altitude field-aligned\nacceleration (at an altitude of 6000\u201312 000 km) above the\npre-existing low-altitude acceleration, which results in vio-\nlent auroral breakup and poleward expansion. The strong\nFAC reinforcement with large amplitude fluctuation in the\nsecond stage suggests a rapid current flow into the ionosphere\nthat diverted from the tail current disruption region in the\nnear earth plasma sheet.\nAcknowledgements.
