Family B G protein-coupled receptors contain a putative N-terminal signal peptide, but its role in receptor synthesis and trafficking are unclear.

The signal peptide is cleaved during synthesis and processing of the receptor. An enhanced GFP-epitope tag at the N-terminus of the receptor permitted synthesis of the receptor but blocked signal peptide cleavage and prevented trafficking to the plasma membrane. Cleavage site mutation allowed synthesis of a full-length receptor, blocked signal peptide cleavage and caused retention within the endoplasmic reticulum.\\ud\n\\ud\nConclusions and implications: Signal peptide cleavage was not essential for receptor synthesis but was obligatory for processing and trafficking of receptors to the plasma membrane.
