Introduction\nThe Welsh Basin is regarded as an ensialic marginal\nmarine basin that formed during the contraction of\nthe adjacent Iapetus and Rheic oceans during the\nEarly Palaeozoic Caledonian orogenic cycle (e.g.\nCocks & Fortey, 1982; Soper & Hutton, 1984; Soper\n& Woodcock, 2003; Woodcock, Soper & Strachan,\n2007). It is characterized by high subsidence rates\nthat accommodated a thick sequence of basinal\nsediments (Woodcock et al. 1996), and contrasts\nmarkedly with the contemporaneous, relatively stable,\nMidland Platform to the east (Woodcock & Gibbons,\n1988).\nDuring deposition of the latest Ashgill to middle\nLlandovery series, between around 445 and 430 Ma\n(after Melchin, Cooper & Sadler, 2004), the southern\nWelsh Basin recorded the development of a broad NW-\nfacing slope apron, constructed principally from turbid-\nitic and hemipelagic mudstones supplied from the east\n(Ball et al. 1992; Davies et al. 1997), that extended\nwest from the Tywi Lineament, a contemporaneous\nstructural high separating basinal and shelfal domains\n(Fig. 1; Woodcock, 1984). Locally punctuating this\nmudstone-dominated succession are several small-\n\u2020Author for correspondence: dis@bgs.ac.uk\nscale bodies of conglomerate and sandstone turbidites,\nalso sourced from the east (Fig. 1; Morton et al.\n1992). These define narrow submarine corridors via\nwhich coarse clastic sediment was routed across the\nproximal parts of the slope apron, as well as lobe-\nlike constructional features of similar material on the\nslope apron surface (Cave & Hains, 1986; Davies &\nWaters, 1995). As with many modern systems (e.g.\nPickering, Hiscott & Hein, 1989), the confined nature\nof the proximal parts of these coarse-grade sediment\nbodies suggests a point source that was linked,\nvia the adjacent shelf, to a contemporary fluvial\nsystem.\nThe changes in facies architecture and depositional\nstyle of these turbidite systems are thought to reflect\ntectonically and eustatically driven sea-level changes\n(e.g. Davies et al. 1997). Unravelling these influences\nprovides insights into the nature and timing of both\npalaeo-plate interactions (e.g. Cocks & Torsvik, 2002)\nand global climatic variation during Early Palaeozoic\ntimes (e.g. Loydell, 1998; Page et al. 2007 and\nreferences therein).\nTectonically driven sea-level changes in the Welsh\nBasin were controlled by oblique terminal collision\nof the palaeocontinents of Baltica, Laurentia and\nAvalonia, marked in the Welsh Basin by transtensional\nbasin development that came to an end with the final\n122 D.

Geological sketch map of part of Central Wales, illustrating the location and setting of the late Ordovician to early Silurian\nbasinal coarse clastic sequences considered herein. Box illustrates area shown in Figure 2a. Inset shows location of study area in\nsouthern Britain. Coordinates use the British National Grid and lie within the 100 km square SN.\nexcision of the Iapetus Ocean at around 420 Ma (Soper\n& Woodcock, 2003). Dynamic changes in overall basin\ngeometry during this period led to episodic intrabasinal\nuplift and subsidence, local compartmentalization and\nswitching of sediment source areas and supply routes\n(e.g. Woodcock et al. 1996; Davies et al. 1997). Eustatic\nsea-level changes are thought to have been strongly\ninfluenced by the development of an ice sheet on the\nmain Gondwanan palaeocontinent, which was located\nat high latitudes in the southern hemisphere during\nLate Ordovician and Early Silurian times (e.g. Loydell,\n1998; Cocks & Torsvik, 2002). Advance and retreat\nof land-based ice sheets is thought to have produced\nsignificant changes in sea level (e.g. Brenchley, 1988;\nPage et al. 2007).\nThis paper presents a new stratigraphic and architec-\ntural description of a previously unrecognized coarse-\ngrained turbidite corridor, located to the NW of the\ntown of Llanwrtyd Wells in Powys (Fig. 1), and herein\ntermed the Nant Brianne turbidite system (Fig. 2a, b;\nSchofield et al. 2004; Davies et al. 2006). Interpret-\nation of the system\u2019s evolution is considered in the\ncontext of previously described examples, and the\ninteraction of contemporary tectonic, local- and global-\nscale base level changes. Together, these highlight\nthe importance of differentiating eustatic and tectonic\neffects on base level when interpreting the stratigraphic\narchitecture of ancient turbidite systems.\n2. Stratigraphic context\nThe salient features of the Ashgill to middle Llandovery\nsubmarine slope apron succession, represented as a\nschematic vertical section in Figure 2b, have been\ndescribed in detail by Davies et al. (1997; see also\nSchofield et al. 2004; Davies et al. 2006). In summary,\nthis succession comprises an alternation between an-\noxic facies, comprising dark grey turbidite mudstones\ninterlayered with prominent laminated hemipelagic\nmudstones (Cwmere Formation and Monograptus\nsedgwickii Shales Member) and oxic facies, of\npale green-grey, strongly burrow mottled turbidite\nmudstone and hemipelagite (Mottled Mudstone Mem-\nber, Derwenlas Formation and Rhayader Mudstones\nFormation).\nTwo contemporaneous, late Hirnantian to early Tely-\nchian, laterally derived, coarse clastic turbidite systems,\nthe Caban\u2013Ystrad Meurig system and Allt-y-clych\nConglomerate, have been described to date (Fig. 1).\nThe most extensive of these, the Caban\u2013Ystrad\nMeurig system, crops out on the NW margin of the\nTywi Lineament near the town of Rhayader, and is\nrepresented by a coeval succession exposed in the core\nof the Teifi Anticline (Lapworth, 1900; Jones, 1922;\nKelling & Woollands, 1969; Davies & Waters, 1995;\nDavies et al. 1997; J. Holroyd, unpub. Ph.D. thesis,\nUniv. of Wales, Swansea, 1978). It was active from\nA new Silurian turbidite system in Central Wales 123\nFigure 2.

(b) Schematic vertical\nsection and key to ornaments and symbols in (a).\nlatest Ordovician (late Hirnantian) to early Telychian\ntimes and is interpreted as recording the deposition of\na series of small, unconfined distributory fans (Ystrad\nMeurig Grits), supplied by a narrow channel\u2013overbank\nsystem (Caban Conglomerate: Davies & Waters, 1995;\nDavies et al. 1997; Davies, Waters & Copus, 1999). The\nAllt-y-clych Conglomerate (Andrew, 1925), contained\nwithin the Rhuddanian proximal slope apron sequence,\nis preserved along the eastern margin of the Tywi\nLineament and comprises a thin sequence that may\nlink with the Caban\u2013Ystrad Meurig system (Davies\net al. 1997; Davies, Waters & Copus, 1999).\nThe early Telychian parts of the Caban Conglomerate\nFormation, which post-date the Ystrad Meurig Grits,\nformed one of several supply routes to the early parts\nof the Devil\u2019s Bridge Formation (Davies et al. 2006),\na turbidite system, up to 600 m in thickness, that\nblanketed much of the basin west of the Central Wales\nLineament during early to middle Telychian times\n(Cave & Hains, 1986; Davies et al. 1997; James, 2005).\nRecent surveying by the British Geological Survey\nin the Builth Wells and adjacent Lampeter districts has\nrevealed another broadly contemporaneous, easterly\nderived, coarse clastic turbidite system, transecting\nthe same slope apron succession as the Caban\u2013Ystrad\nMeurig system (Davies et al. 1997). It is located on\nthe NW flank of the Tywi Lineament, centred on the\nLlyn Brianne dam [SN 795 485] (Schofield et al. 2004;\nDavies et al. 2006). The main depositional unit, the\nNant Brianne Formation, takes its name from one of\nthe tributaries to the SW arm of the reservoir, but the\nNant Brianne turbidite system, as defined here, includes\nadditional, sandstone-rich units and flanking facies also\npresent in the vicinity (Fig. 2). Anoxic horizons within\nthe succession favour preservation of graptolites. These\nhave been used to provide a detailed biostratigraphic\nframework for the architecture of the Nant Brianne\nsystem. Key localities and ages are listed in Table 1\nand plotted on Figures 2a and 3.\nCoarse clastic sediments were first recognized in this\narea by K. A. Davies (1933). Mackie (A. H. Mackie,\nunpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Cambridge, 1987, 1993; see\nalso Mackie & Smallwood, 1987) did not distinguish\nthe Nant Brianne Formation sand body as a separate\nunit and included the equivalent strata principally in his\nCefn Isaf and Llyn Brianne formations, but also locally\nin his Hafdre Formation; the latter has been shown to\ninclude rocks now recognized as part of the overlying,\nsoutherly sourced Cwmystwyth Grits Group (Davies\net al. 2006). Nevertheless, much of the palaeocurrent\nand other directional data cited below concur with\nMackie\u2019s findings.\n3. Nant Brianne turbidite system\nThe main architectural features of the Nant Brianne\nsystem and its relationship with the enveloping slope\napron succession are illustrated in Figure 3. As this\nsystem has not previously been described, sedimento-\nlogical features of the component successions are\npresented in Appendix 1. The system rests locally on\nthe basal Mottled Mudstone Member of the Cwmere\nFormation, which is of persculptus graptolite Biozone\nage, and provides an important stratigraphic datum.\nBeneath the Nant Brianne Formation, separate and\nin part older elements of the system comprise two\nsandstone-rich units here named the Ystradffin and\nDinas formations. Upper levels of the Nant Brianne\nFormation pass laterally into a distinctive siltstone-rich\nflanking facies included in the Rhayader Mudstones\nFormation and are succeeded by divisions of the\nsoutherly sourced Cwmystwyth Grits Group (Schofield\net al. 2004; Davies et al. 2006).\n124 D.

Ystradffin Formation\nThis newly named division ranges from latest Ordovi-\ncian (Hirnantian) to early Aeronian age and comprises\nup to 350 m of thinly interbedded sandstones and mud-\nstones arranged in Bouma (1962) turbidite sequences\n(Fig. 4a). Lower levels of the formation succeed the\nMottled Mudstone Member. In the axis of the system,\nupper levels of the formation yield probable trian-\ngulatus graptolite Biozone assemblages (locality 2).\nPalaeocurrent vectors from the formation range from\nWSW to ENE, but are dominantly N- to NW-directed.\n3.b. Dinas Formation\nThis spatially separate sandstone-rich sequence com-\nprises up to 200 m of thinly interbedded turbidite\nsandstones and mudstones, laterally equivalent in its\nlower half to the adjacent Cwmere Formation. In\ncontrast, burrowed hemipelagites and the presence of\ntrace fossil casts on the bases of the sandstones show\nthe upper part, up to 150 m, of the formation to be oxic\nand coeval with the enveloping Derwenlas Formation.\nNo graptolite faunas have been recovered from the\nDinas Formation, but its stratigraphic relationship with\nthe enveloping sediments support an early to middle\nAeronian age, with marked lateral expansion of its oxic\nportion initiated in the late magnus graptolite Biozone.\n3.c. Nant Brianne Formation\nThe Nant Brianne Formation, which crops out in the\nvicinity of the Llyn Brianne reservoir and dam [SN\n795 485] (Fig. 2), ranges up to 410 m in thickness\nand records the middle Aeronian to middle Telychian\nevolution of the Nant Brianne turbidite system. The\noldest (Aeronian) parts of the formation are confined\nwithin a narrow central zone located immediately to\nthe west of the Llyn Brianne Fault. In this part of the\nsuccession, the formation contains units of turbidite\nconglomerate, and slumped strata (Figs 4b, 5), which\nFigure 4.

However, the base of the formation is\nstrongly diachronous, and during Telychian times a\nrapid lateral expansion occurred outwards from this\ncentral area (Fig. 3). In the upper part of the system,\nA new Silurian turbidite system in Central Wales 127\nthinly interbedded turbidite sandstones and mudstones\nare interlayered with subordinate mudstone-dominated\nintervals, closely comparable to adjacent slope apron\nfacies. Much thinner sequences occupy these western\nand eastern \u2018wings\u2019, but at their maximum, these\nyounger levels of the formation occupy a 9 km wide\nbelt. Palaeocurrent measurements in the vicinity of the\nLlyn Brianne Fault, including pebble orientations (after\nA. H. Mackie, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Cambridge,\n1987), indicate turbidity current flow mainly towards\nthe NW, consistent with those for the formation as\na whole. Slump fold axes in the adjacent disturbed\nsequence are oriented parallel to the NW-trending fault.\n4. Discussion\n4.a. Local controls on turbidite system evolution\nThe Nant Brianne system records the influence of sea-\nfloor topography on localizing deposition. In the lowest\npart of the system, Mackie (A. H. Mackie, unpub. Ph.D.\nthesis, Univ. Cambridge, 1987) envisaged his Clyn-glas\nFormation (approximately equivalent to the Ystradffin\nFormation of this account) as infilling a broad hollow,\neither a slump scar or a channel, formed during the\nlate Ordovician fall in sea level. However, he did\nnot recognize the presence of the Mottled Mudstone\nMember as a continuous datum beneath the Ystradffin\nFormation, which indicates that the latter shows no\nerosion at the base, and instead formed a positive,\nconstructional feature on the contiguous slope apron\nsurface (Fig. 3). The Dinas Formation may mark the\nsite of a smaller, younger lobe, the location of which,\noffset to the south, was in part determined by the relief\ncreated by the earlier Ystradffin feature (cf. Davies &\nWaters, 1995).\nThe early (Aeronian) part of the Nant Brianne\nFormation records a period of laterally confined\nsand and gravel deposition. Graptolites of the con-\nvolutus graptolite Biozone (locality 9) from within\nthe formation and from anoxic levels within the\nDerwenlas Formation to the east of the Llyn Brianne\nFault (localities 3 and 4) attest to dramatic lateral\nfacies change across the fault and confirm that it\nformed a significant topographic feature at this time.\nIt was thus probably instrumental in confining and\naccommodating the late Aeronian evolution of the\nNant Brianne Formation. The relief created by the\nearlier Ystradffin and Dinas features, and a localized\ndepocentre created by a probable linear half-graben\nformed by movement on the Llyn Brianne Fault (Fig. 3),\nwere clearly instrumental in locating a narrow cor-\nridor in which gravels were deposited from high-\nconcentration, surging and bottom-hugging turbidity\nflows (e.g. Pickering, Scott & Hein, 1989; Hein &\nWalker, 1982). This channelized belt was subsequently\noccluded or displaced by the foundering of adjacent\nslope apron muds along the active fault scarp.\nThe earliest parts of the Nant Brianne Formation\neast of the Llyn Brianne Fault overlie the Monograptus\nsedgwickii Shales Member and record the overtopping\nof the fault scarp, ending its role as a confining structure\nsometime during the Late Aeronian to Early Telychian\n(Fig. 3). The rapid expansion of the Nant Brianne\nFormation during Telychian times may record the re-\nestablishment and advance of a lobe-like body above\nthe earlier channelized units. However, it remained\npartially confined on its eastern flank, suggesting that\ndeposition of this part of the formation was still\ninfluenced by sea-floor relief created previously by the\nLlyn Brianne Fault.\n4.b. High order eustatic controls\nFigure 6 illustrates the biostratigraphic range and lateral\nextent of the various Rhuddanian to Telychian coarse\nclastic bodies, relative to the slope apron sequence\nin which they are embedded. Within the slope apron\nsequences, the alternation of oxic and anoxic intervals\nmay in some instances record key eustatic events of\nthe late Hirnantian to early Telychian period, many\nof which may relate to the retreat and advance of a\nfluctuating Gondwanan ice sheet (Page et al. 2007).\nIn Central Wales, two main transgressive\u2013regressive\ncycles, defining two major sedimentary sequences, are\nrecognized. The principal events and the local slope\u2013\napron responses were as follows:\n(1) An initial late Hirnantian to Rhuddanian age major\npost-glacial rise in sea level which established\nanoxic slope apron conditions. This transgression\nwas sustained throughout Rhuddanian times with\na consensus that maximum flooding was achieved\nduring the cyphus graptolite Biozone (e.g. Johnson,\nKaljo & Rong, 1991).\n(2) An early Aeronian regression which introduced\noxic slope apron facies. There is growing evidence\nto suggest that this event had its acme at or around\nthe magnus\u2013leptotheca biozonal boundary (e.g.\nLoydell, 1998).\n(3) A late Aeronian transgression (or transgressions).\nAn analysis of global data (Page et al. 2007) sug-\ngests that a global marine transgression occurred\nat the time of the convolutus graptolite Biozone,\ncorresponding with thin units of anoxic facies\nmudstones of this age, recognized in the slope apron\nsuccession of the Welsh Basin (Davies et al. 1997).\nHowever, within the basin and on its contiguous\nshelf, together with records from other basinal\nsuccessions from the Iapetus\u2013Rheic ocean margin\nof Gondwana, there is clear evidence of a more\nmarked and rapid rise in sea level around the start of\nthe succeeding sedgwickii graptolite Biozone (Page\net al. 2007 and references therein). The eustatic\nnature of this event is questioned (Page et al. 2007),\nbut on the local slope apron it is clearly recor-\nded by the widespread Monograptus sedgwickii\nShales anoxic interval which correlates, at least\nin part, with an overstepping, Pentamerus-bearing\n128 D. I . SCHOFIELD AND OTHERS\nFigure 6. Regional architecture illustrating the biostratigraphic range and relative lateral extent of the Nant Brianne and Caban\u2013Ystrad\nMeurig systems relative to the host slope apron succession.\nsandstone bed in adjacent shelf sequences (Davies\net al. 1997; Schofield et al. 2004).\n(4) Global data provide evidence of a possible glacially\ninduced regression during the sedgwickii graptolite\nBiozone. In the Welsh Basin, resumption of oxic\nslope apron deposition above the Monograptus\nsedgwickii Shales Member was perhaps the local\nresponse to this event. Predominantly oxic depos-\nition, as recorded by the Rhayader Mudstones, was\nsustained throughout much of the ensuing early\nTelychian interval, but conflicts with evidence of\nrising global sea level at this time (Davies et al.\n1997).\nThe geometry of the sand-rich systems reveals trends\nthat are at odds with obvious eustatic influences.\nIn particular, the outbuilding of lobes of sand-rich\nsediment during late Hirnantian to early Rhuddanian\ntimes (persculptus to acuminatus graptolite biozones),\nas represented by the Ystradffin Formation of the Nant\nBrianne system, and the Cerig Gwynion Grits of the\nCaban\u2013Ystrad Meurig system, occurred during rapidly\nrising sea level. Although these may in part reflect\nhigher frequency, lower order eustatic controls (see next\nSection), an alternative explanation for this is that these\nbodies are analogous to the \u2018slope front fills\u2019 identified\non seismically imaged slope apron successions (e.g.\nMitchell et al. 1993), and may record the reworking\nand basinward transport of sand previously carried onto\nthe adjacent shelf during the preceding glacio-eustatic\nlowstand.\nA comparable situation occurred with the expansion\nof the Caban\u2013Ystrad Meurig system to its greatest\nlateral extent during a period of sea-level highstand,\ncoincident with the cyphus graptolite Biozone (Davies\n& Waters, 1995). This expansion was accompanied\nby deposition of the Allt-y-clych Conglomerate and\ncontinued sedimentation in the Ystradffin tract.\nA significant reduction of sediment input into both\nturbidite systems, which began in the late cyphus\ngraptolite Biozone and lasted into the triangulatus\ngraptolite Biozone, could reflect the delayed influence\nof the global transgression on sediment supply (see\nnext Section). Certainly, the marked expansion during\nthe succeeding magnus graptolite Biozone in both the\nDinas and Caban Conglomerate formations, coinciding\nwith the onset of oxic conditions across the adjacent\nslope apron (base Derwenlas Formation), can be\ninterpreted as a response, at least in part, to the early\nAeronian eustatic regression.\n4.c. Low order eustatic controls\nThe coarse grade and large volume of clastic material\nsupplied to the Nant Brianne and Caban\u2013Ystrad\nMeurig systems, at times of eustatic sea-level rise,\nappears to support the suggestion that the detritus was\ngenerated in response to tectonic uplift in sediment\nsource areas sited to the east of the basin (Woodcock\net al. 1996; Davies et al. 1997). However, Davies,\nWaters & Copus (1999) recognized a close comparison\nwith the architectural elements of many hydrocarbon-\nbearing deep-water basins, such as that described\nA new Silurian turbidite system in Central Wales 129\nby Mitchell et al. (1993) for the Palaeocene of the\nFaeroe Basin. There, each episode of turbidite system\nexpansion is correlated with a minor marine regression.\nAssuming that the patterns of sediment input are driven\nexclusively by base level changes and not variations\nin supply and\/or the rate of subsidence, application\nof this model to the turbidite systems examined in\nthis paper implies that a series of lower order events\n(Fig. 6), which influenced the flux of coarse-grade\ndetritus entering the basin, were superimposed on the\nmajor eustatic cycles. When there was concordance\nbetween the smaller and larger eustatic cycles, typically\nascribed to orbital forcing (e.g. Fischer & Bottjer,\n1991), the sediment supply could be predicted to be\neither especially high or low (Van Wagoner et al. 1990).\nThe former was possibly the case during early Aeronian\ntimes, the latter during the sedgwickii Biozone.\nThe high levels of coarse clastic input during the\ncyphus graptolite Biozone at the height of the Rhud-\ndanian post-glacial transgression remain an enigma.\nViewed in isolation, it could be argued that this period\nof turbidite system expansion, as with the earlier\nYstradffin and Cerig Gwynion Grits lobes, records the\nbasinward transfer of sand and gravel as part of a re-\ngrading of the shelf edge; furthermore, this would have\ntaken place during the early phases of a lower order\ntransgression (Ross et al. 1994). However, coeval shelf\nsuccessions also experienced increased levels of sand\ninput at this time (Barclay et al. 2005; Cocks et al.\n1984; Schofield et al. 2004), indicating that the pattern\nof deposition was controlled by marine regression.\nSubsequently, the global high sea-level conditions and\na lower order base-level rise may have combined to\nabruptly limit the input of sediment during the marked\ntriangulatus graptolite Biozone contraction.\n4.d. Regional tectonic controls\nThe marked increase in the volume of sandy de-\ntritus supplied to the basin during deposition of\nthe Telychian Series coincided with the onset of\nwidespread tectonism throughout the basin and its\nhinterland (Woodcock et al. 1996), and contrasts with\nearlier, localized tectonic activity preserved in the\nRhuddanian and Aeronian record of the basin margin\n(e.g. Woolhope and Usk basins: Woodcock et al. 1996;\nButler, Woodcock & Stewart, 1997). Any evidence for\nthe influence of eustatic events is lacking, and it is\nclear that the detritus entering the basin was, at this\ntime, dominantly tectonically generated. The Telychian\nexpansion of the Nant Brianne system coincided with a\nmarked reduction of the Caban\u2013Ystrad Meurig system,\nsuggesting that the latter was replaced by the former\nas the principal point of supply to the \u2018blanket phase\u2019\nof the Devil\u2019s Bridge Formation (Fig. 1; see Davies\net al. 1997). Faulting, both within the basin and along\nits margins, ultimately led to the abandonment of the\nNant Brianne and Caban\u2013Ystrad Meurig systems as\ntheir supply paths from the east were dislocated and\nthe direction of sediment input to the basin switched to\nthe south (Woodcock et al. 1996; Davies et al. 1997,\n2006).\n5. Conclusions\nThe newly recognized late Hirnantian to early Tely-\nchian Nant Brianne turbidite system represents a\nnarrow corridor of laterally supplied, easterly sourced,\ncoarse-grained deposits that punctuated a mudstone-\ndominated slope apron, along the SE margin of the\nsouthern Welsh Basin. Application of high-precision\ngraptolite biostratigraphy has shown that its evolu-\ntion, and that of coeval coarse-grained systems, was\ninfluenced by a number of factors, including sea-floor\ntopography and synsedimentary faulting. However, the\ninteraction of high order eustatic events, related to\nfluctuation of contemporary Gondwanan ice sheets,\nwith lower order, lower magnitude sea-level changes,\nappears to have been a critical influence on sedimentary\narchitecture prior to the onset and overriding influence\nof Telychian age regional tectonism.\nAcknowledgements.

Detailed description of rock units and facies\n(see main text for additional data)\nYstradffin Formation. The formation attains its maximum\nthickness in its type area between Ystradffin Farm [SN 788\n466] and an inlet of the Llyn Brianne Reservoir [SN 816 495]\nand passes laterally into the enveloping slope apron mudstone\nsuccession (Cwmere Formation). It extends laterally, along\nstrike for a distance of 8.5 km and incorporates some of the\nsections described in detail by A. H. Mackie (unpub. Ph.D.\nthesis, Univ. Cambridge, 1987) and included in his Clyn Glas\nFormation (see also Mackie & Smallwood, 1987).\nA single lithofacies of thin- to medium-bedded turbidite\nsandstones, interbedded with thin turbidite and hemipelagic\nmudstones was recognized within the formation (Fig. 4a).\nThis is characterized by tabular sandstone beds, up to 0.3 m\nthick, that form the basal division of sandstone\u2013mudstone\ncouplets. Base-cut-out Tb\u2013e and Tc\u2013e sequences predominate\n(Bouma, 1962), while graded basal Ta divisions, including\ncomplete Ta\u2013e sequences and top-cut-out Ta\u2013b sequences, are\nrare. Turbidite mudstone (Te) intervals range up to 0.15 m\nin thickness. Many of the sandstones display convolute\nlamination. Sections in the east of the formation measured by\nMackie (A. H. Mackie, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Cambridge,\n132 A new Silurian turbidite system in Central Wales\n1987) include a series of small-scale (< 10 m) thinning- and\nfining-upwards cycles. The thickest turbidite sandstone beds\noccur in the lower part of the formation, where the sandstone\ncontent ranges up to 60 %.\nDinas Formation. The type locality of this unit are the\ncrags south of the Afon Tywi [SN 774 458]. Laminated\nhemipelagites present in the lower, anoxic levels are restricted\nto the south of Dinas [SN 780 465], but the oxic portion is\nmore widespread and forms the whole of the sandstone-rich\nsequence on, and to the north, of this prominent rock buttress.\nThe oxic levels also crop out to the NW along both limbs of\nthe Doethie Anticline (Fig. 2). Its geometry suggests that\ndepositing turbidity currents flowed predominantly towards\nthe NW.\nThe formation comprises a facies of thin-bedded turbidite\nsandstones, interbedded with thin turbidite and hemipelagic\nmudstones characterized by tabular and lenticular turbidite\nsandstones, up to 0.1 m thick that are typically planar-\nor cross-laminated and form part of turbidite sandstone\u2013\nmudstone couplets (Tb\u2013e and Tc\u2013e; Bouma, 1962).\nNant Brianne Formation. Road cuttings to the east of the\nLlyn Brianne dam provide a section [SN 793 482] through\nthe oldest (Aeronian) levels of the Nant Brianne Formation.\nAt this stratigraphic level, the formation occupies a 2 km\nwide belt confined on its eastern side by the Llyn Brianne\nFault. In the section adjacent to the dam access road (Fig. 5), a\nbasal sequence of slumped and disturbed strata passes up into\na 17 m thick unit of Bouma sandstone-mudstone couplets\n(Fig. 4c), including a thin unit with anoxic hemipelagites.\nThese are overlain by a 3 m thick unit composed of medium\nto thick beds of turbidite conglomerate and pebbly sandstone\n(Fig. 4b). Conglomeratic facies are also seen in river cliffs\n[SN 480 785] to the SW of the Llyn Brianne dam. The\nconglomeratic beds of the access road section are succeeded\nby a sequence, up to 100 m thick, of slumped and disturbed\nstrata (Figs 2, 3) that also occupies a narrow belt adjacent\nto the Llyn Brianne Fault. The mudstone-dominated parts of\nthe disturbed sequence resemble the oxic slope apron facies\nwhich crop out to the east of the Llyn Brianne Fault.\nThe upper (Telychian) part of the Nant Brianne Formation\ncomprises rhythmically interlayered thin- to medium-bedded\nturbidite sandstones and mudstones. The lower part of this\nsequence comprises about 50 % sandstone with individual\nbeds up to 0.5 m thick. Above this the sequence comprises\na crudely thinning- and fining-upwards succession in which\nthe sandstone content diminishes to as little as 10 %. Packets\nof strata essentially identical to enveloping slope apron\nfacies are also present throughout the upper part of the\nformation. This part of the sequence crops out between the\nLlyn Brianne Reservoir and Craig Pysgotwr, occupying both\nlimbs of the Doethie Anticline and the core of the Cilgwyn\nSyncline (Fig. 2). The eastern \u2018wing\u2019 of the formation\nextends some 5 km beyond the fault and ranges up to\n200 m in thickness. Traced NE toward Nant Rhyd Goch it\nbecomes thinner and its base younger, and its upper parts\npass laterally into a distinctive siltstone-laminated facies\nof the Rhayader Mudstones that has yielded graptolites of\nearly to middle Telychian (turriculatus graptolite Biozone)\nage (localities 6 and 7). To the SW, between Llyn Brianne\ndam and Bwlchnewydd, the base of the formation is\ndiachronous above the datum of the Monograptus sedgwickii\nShales Member and represents part of a SW expansion\nof the system which mirrors that to the east (Fig. 3).\nEarly to middle Telychian turriculatus Biozone graptolites\nhave been recovered from anoxic hemipelagites preserved\nwithin this western \u2018wing\u2019, on Craig Pysgotwr (localities 13\nand 14).\nThe Nant Brianne Formation comprises three sedimentary\nlithofacies:\n(a) The confined lower part of the formation predominantly\ncomprises medium- to thick-bedded turbidite conglom-\nerate and pebbly sandstone. The conglomerates are\npoorly sorted and include well-rounded clasts, up to\n0.1 m in diameter, composed of vein quartz, igneous\nand sedimentary rock types, in a matrix of coarse-\ngrained sandstone; mudstone rip-up clasts, abraded and\nbroken shelly fossils, including corals, are common.\nNormally graded beds above a locally channelized base\nrecord the rapid deposition from high concentration\ngravel-laden gravity flows (R3; Lowe, 1982). Rare cross-\nstratification (S1) and planar lamination (S2) visible in\nthe sandier upper parts of some beds indicate tractional\nprocesses that were operative during the later phases\nof deposition, but structureless sandstone intervals (S3)\nthat were deposited from suspension are more common.\nAt the margins of this facies a basal conglomerate\nlayer, commonly rich in shell debris, is succeeded by\nan upward-fining sandstone displaying well-developed\nplanar- and cross-laminated divisions (Ta\u2013c).\n(b) Disturbed beds, which succeed the conglomeratic facies\nin the vicinity of the Llyn Brianne Fault, comprise a\nlower unit of highly contorted and disrupted mudstones,\nwith isolated pillows of conglomerate and sandstone,\nand a thicker upper unit of slump-folded and destratified\nmudstone which displays abundant evidence of small-\nscale synsedimentary faulting and down-slope sliding\n(Mackie & Smallwood, 1987).\n(c) The bulk of the formation comprises thin- to medium-\nbedded turbidite sandstones interbedded with thin tur-\nbidite and hemipelagic mudstones. In this facies, some\nof the thicker sandstone beds form part of complete\nBouma sequences (Ta\u2013e), in which the normally graded\nand coarser-grained Ta division commonly infills shallow\nscours, but most of the sandstones are tabular, medium-\nto fine-grained, and display planar-laminated (Tb) and\/or\ncross- or convolute-laminated (Tc) intervals. Siltstone\nlaminae (Td) are commonly present at the base of the\nsucceeding mudstone Te division. Many of these beds\ncontain fine shell debris and preserve the casts of trace\nfossils, together with tool marks and groove casts on\nthe bases of most beds, although flute casts are less\ncommon. In the upper levels of this sequence, the sand-\nstone\/mudstone couplets predominantly comprise Tc\u2013e\nsequences. Planar-laminated Tb divisions are rare and\nTa divisions are absent. Turbidites composed exclusively\nof the mudstone Te division, with or without a basal\nTd interval, increase in importance and are the principal\ncomponent of thin, mudstone-dominated packets in the\nuppermost parts of the formation. Many of these include\na basal, cross- and planar-laminated siltstone interval,\ndisplay the features described by Stow & Piper (1984) and\nare the product of deposition from very low concentration\nturbidity currents.\n"}
