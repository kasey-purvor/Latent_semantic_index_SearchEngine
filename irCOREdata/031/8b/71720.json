A new approach arising out of the concept \nof equifinality of models (structures and parameter sets) in application is outlined in the form of an \nuncertain \u201clandscape space\u201d to model space mapping.  The possibility of hypothesis testing within this \nframework is proposed as a means of refining the mapping, with a focus on the differentiation of \nfunction within the model space.  The approach combines elements of instrumentalism, relativism, \nBayesianism and pragmatism while allowing the realist stance that underlies much of the practice of \nenvironmental modelling as a fundamental aim.  It may be an interim philosophy that is awaiting \ndevelopments in measurement technique to allow further refinement, but allows some coherent \nguidance about how to be specific in presenting predictions to end-users. \n \n1.  Why a new philosophy? \n \nIt is quite possible to develop and use environmental models without any explicit underlying \nphilosophy (although see, for example, Peters, 1991; Abbott, 1992; Rhoads and Thorn, 1996; Anderson \nand Bates, 2001, for discussions in different areas of environmental science).  Many practitioners do, of \ncourse, although most might have the aim of developing and using models that are as \u201crealistic as \npossible\u201d, given the constraints of current knowledge, computing capabilities, observational \ntechnologies and available time.  This type of implicit or pragmatic realism seems quite natural and \nappears to be intrinsic to modelling efforts as diverse as the coupled General Circulation Models \n(GCMs) being used to predict future climate change and modelling of the biogeochemical processes \n 2 \ninvolved in the transport of radionuclides or persistent organic pollutants in the environment.  The \nphilosophical subtleties are not really necessary to the practising environmental modeller who only \nneeds to know that achieving realism is still difficult in the practical prediction of complex \nenvironmental systems.  Current implementations of such models are known to have their limitations \n(even if the true level of uncertainty in model predictions is not widely appreciated) but it is implicitly \naccepted that they will continue to evolve towards more realistic representations of the earth-ocean-\natmosphere-biosphere system. \n \nIt will be argued in this paper that while this pragmatic realism has served environmental science well, \nit does have major flaws and should be replaced.  Experience suggests that philosophical arguments \nalone will have little impact on the way in which modelling is actually done but there is, perhaps, at \nleast the start of a recognition of the need for a more scientifically robust assessment of model \ncapabilities and predictions.   The view adopted here that a new philosophical approach to \nenvironmental modelling is needed stems not from any deep notions of environmentalism, nor from \nany higher level holistic principles of nature, nor directly from philosophical arguments about the \nconcept(s) of realism itself, but from experience of practical applications of modelling in various areas \nof environmental science.  In what follows, a coherent philosophical framework for environmental \nmodelling is outlined that might satisfy this need while allowing for model structural error and the \nincorporation of improved knowledge over time.   \n \nIn section 2 the theory and practice of environmental modelling are briefly summarised, together with \nsome comments on the impact of complexity and unknowability on the process of formulating and \nevaluating environmental models.   Section 3 addresses the problems posed by uniqueness of place in \nthe application of environmental models.  This is an issue that is becoming increasingly important as \nthe rapid increases in computer power allow environmental models of whole regions or countries (or, \nalbeit still crudely, the globe) to become feasible. Section 4 places such applications into a framework \nof landscape space to model space mapping.  Section 5 shows how this can be used to constrain \npredictive uncertainty, including by a process of hypothesis formulation and testing.  Section 6 \nconsiders the question of explanatory depth of approximate models in predicting the unexpected, and \n 3 \nSection 7 returns to the issue of realism in the face of the apparent relativism of landscape to model \nspace mapping. \n \n2.  Theory and practice in environmental modelling \n \nComputer simulation has become a common methodology in the environmental sciences. It can be used \nas a framework for formulating and testing theories.  It can be used to make predictions for practical \napplications in response to demands from policy and decision makers.  Particularly interesting \nexamples are the predictions of the impacts of global climate change (e.g. van Dam, 1999, Cameron et \nal., 2000) , predictions of groundwater systems (Konikow and Bredehoeft, 1992; Anderson and \nWoessner, 1992; Oreskes et al., 1994), the long term predictions required in geomorphology (Richards \net al., 1995; Beven, 1996a), and predictions of the impacts of underground repositories for nuclear \nwaste (Sellafield in the UK; Yucca Mountain in the US).  Very large research programmes have been \nfunded with a view to improving the accuracy of such predictions.  There is an implicit belief \nunderlying these efforts that this is possible, despite the nonlinear and open nature of the systems being \nstudied and the approximations necessary to implement our qualitative understanding of these systems \nin a working computing program. \n \nThe foundation of this belief is the pragmatic realism noted above.  I am a hydrologist.  As a \nhydrologist I intend that the computer simulation models I develop should represent real water; in \nmodelling contaminant transport in flowing water I intend that the model variables should represent the \nreal contaminant.  This is in spite of the fact that, as a hydrologist, I would recognise the varied \nnomological status of many of the concepts that are used in my models (Beven, 1989; 1996b; Shrader-\nFrechette, 1989; Davis et al., 1992; Hofmann and Hofmann, 1992).  In the same way, the atmospheric \nmodeller will intend that the variables in her computer model should represent the real atmosphere and \nthe aquatic geochemist will intend that the (approximate) computer solutions to systems of \nstoichimetric equations should represent real aqueous solutions.  In time, new understanding and \nknowledge gained from experiments will be incorporated into improved simulations.  In this way the \nresearch programme of environmental science should be progressive  (in the sense of Lakatos, 1978).   \n \n 4 \nThis common working version of realism is, of course, rather na\u00efve.  It is na\u00efve not only from a \nphilosophical point of view but also from a scientific point of view, since it requires that the systems \nunder study be knowable.  Clearly, for many environmental systems the perceived complexities are \nsuch that all the boundary conditions, auxiliary conditions and system characteristics cannot be \nknowable given current measurement technologies.  Thus, in applying this pragmatic realism to any \nparticular open environmental system, it is clear that we can recognise much more complexity than it is \npossible to represent in a mathematical model that, implemented as a computer simulation, will make \nquantitative predictions.  We need to differentiate between this qualitative understanding (the \nperceptual model) gained from our training, qualitative observations, quantitative experiment or \nmonitoring, and the practical application of that understanding in a conceptual or formal model \nrepresentation of the system as a set of equations (Beven, 2001a).  This is not to deny that the \nperceptual model is not conditioned by fundamental theoretical understanding (even if some of the \ncomplexity may be difficult to relate to existing theoretical constructs), but rather to recognise that this \nunderstanding may be very difficult to apply at the scales of interest.  The perceptual model may only \nbe as realistic as current understanding allows.  The conceptual model will, however, be wrong and will \nbe known to be wrong (Morton, 1993), but will still have the possibility of being approximately \nrealistic. \n \nSome of these issues have been explored recently from a philosophical perspective by Cartwright \n(1999) who suggests that open systems might best be represented in terms of the capacities of real \nentities to respond in a particular way to external influences.  She argues that the representation of \nthose capacities is only possible within a nomological system with its own defined constraints and \nlimitations.  Thus, the problem of defining a conceptual model of the system is, within this framework, \na matter of defining a nomological system that may not in itself be realist in terms of being totally \nconsistent with the perceptual model but which can be used to produce quantitative predictions within \nthe limits of its own definition.  This approach is used very widely in environmental modelling.  We \nshould also note here that even having designed a consistent nomological representation of an \nenvironmental system then there may be further approximations necessary in implementing that system \non a digital computer, such as in the approximate discrete numerical solution of the continuum partial \ndifferential equations that are the basis of many environmental models. \n 5 \n \nIn these cases the need for approximating the perceptual model into a set of mathematical concepts at a \ncertain scale of calculation element is obvious.  A good example is the parameterisation of sub-grid \nscale processes in GCMs that are as much a result of computational constraints as lack of \nunderstanding of smaller scale processes.  In other cases the process is not so self-evident, such as \nwhen equilibrium geochemical codes for solutions are applied to mixtures of waters from different \nsources at field scales (while interacting with a variety of mineral surfaces, organic surfaces and \nsuspended colloids).  Even though the principles of the perceptual model may be reasonably well \nunderstood, the implementation of those principles in practice may be difficult both for reasons of \nfinding realistic approximations of complex open systems (within the limitations of computational \nconstraints) and also because of lack of knowledge of the local characteristics of the system and its \nboundary conditions (Beven, 2000, 2001b).   \n \nThis may be in part because we still have some surprises to learn about the nature of the processes but \nit would seem that even if we had a perfect formal description at some practically useful scale, the \ndominant problem is that the characteristics of the system, that have an important control on how the \nsystem works, may be essentially unknowable in detail.  Keeping to the sphere of water, there is an \nanalogy here with the study of turbulence.  Homogeneous turbulence has received much study and \nsimplified representations of the energy dissipation down to viscosity dominated scales are used widely \nin computational fluid dynamics (CFD).  It is true that there are still debates about the best closure \nschemes to use at modelling scales larger than those that are computationally addressable with direct \nnumerical simulation, but for systems that are largely self organising, CFD models often appear to \nproduce acceptable (publishable) results. \n \nHowever, there are many fluid dynamic systems in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes in which \nthe interactions with the boundaries dominate the energy dissipation.  This is true for shallow turbulent \nwater flows in streams and rivers (where the aquatic and bankside vegetation may also play an \nimportant role in energy dissipation depending on the discharge in the channel); it is true for (mostly) \nlaminar porous media flows in soils and groundwaters.  Again, it is not so much that the principles of \nthe interactions are not understood in the perceptual model (though, again, we may still have much to \n 6 \nlearn) but that it is necessary to characterise the energy dissipation at every point in the flow domain or, \nmore correctly, at the scale of the elements of the approximate representation of that flow domain in \nthe procedural implementation of the conceptual model to produce quantitative predictions. \n \nScale here is a very significant issue.  Its effect is seen in extreme form in the case of GCMs.  \nComputational constraints mean that global scale coupled ocean-atmosphere models can still only be \nrun with grid elements that are large relative to the scale of many of the processes being represented, \nparticularly in the sub-grid convection schemes and \u201cland surface parameterisations\u201d used.   Typical \nspatial grid scales, for example in the Hadley Centre CM3 model runs are 2.5 * 3.75 degrees for the \natmosphere and land surface and  1.25 * 1.52 degrees for the oceans (see Gordon et al., 2000).   The \nsame constraints only allow a limited number of layers in the vertical (19 layers for the atmosphere, 20 \nlayers for the oceans).   Thus, smaller scale processes (such as smaller scale turbulence in the \natmosphere and oceans) must be represented by sub-grid scale parameterisations.  For the land surface \nthis has typically meant the implementation of a one-dimensional (in the vertical) model of mass, \nenergy and carbon fluxes in the soil\/vegetation\/lower atmosphere system (e.g. the SiB2 model of \nSellers et al., 1996; or the UK Meteorological Office Unified Model MOSES land surface \nparameterisation, Cox et al., 1999).   A single such model is used to represent each grid square in the \nGCM (or more recently a small number of such models are used to represent different surface covers in \neach grid square as \u201ctiles\u201d).   \n \nSince there is no other source of spatial variability within the land surface parameterisation in each grid \nsquare it is clear that the parameter values required in the model must be \u201ceffective\u201d values that will \nensure that the fluxes from the highly heterogeneous (and time variable) domain that is the real surface \nwill be properly reflected in the model.  To reflect the differences between varied types of vegetation \n(and soil, topography, etc) , different effective parameter values should, in principle, be specified for \neach grid square (or tile).  A change in grid scale might also require different effective parameter \nvalues because the processes controlling the fluxes between land and atmosphere are nonlinear (which \nactually implies that different equations might also be required at different scales as well as different \neffective parameter values, though this is often ignored).  Ways of aggregating local information to \nsuggest grid scale effective parameter values might also be different in different environments.  In \n 7 \nsome, the surface may be generally wet and the surface cover does not exert the dominant control; in \nsome the topographic controls on the availability of water may be dominant; in others the surface may \nbe predominantly dry but there may be irrigated fields that are an important control on the fluxes (an \nexcellent example may be found in Bastiaanssen et al., 1994).  Such variability is generally ignored in \ncurrent GCMs: effective parameters are often taken to be equal to local scale parameters for the \n\u201cdominant\u201d cover and soil types.  This is clearly one choice of a land surface parameterisation.  It is \nprocess-based in the sense that the processes thought to be important at the local scale are represented \nin the model; it is very often a nonsense in that the model structures and parameters used take no \naccount of the (nonlinear) sub-grid scale variability that controls the grid scale fluxes.    \n \nThis is, of course, only one of the sub-grid scale components required by GCMs.  Others are required \nfor sub-grid scale convection; cloud and rain formation; ocean aerosol production; etc (although at least \nwith the latest generation of coupled ocean-atmosphere models there is no longer a need for annual flux \ncorrections, see Gordon et al., 2000).   Others still, such as the effect of topography on the availability \nof water to plants in valley bottoms during dry periods, or the effect of local sub-grid scale wetting by \nconvective rainstorms on grid scale latent heat fluxes, are not taken into account at all in the current \nmodels.  All will require effective parameters, and boundary conditions, at the grid scale.   The more \nprocesses that are included then, in general, the more parameter values that will be required before \npredictions can be made.  Similar arguments will apply to all other distributed environmental models \nthat depend on such sub-grid scale parameterisations.  This will be the case even down to quite small \ngrid scales when current measurement techniques are limited to \"point\" scale measurements (Beven, \n2001b). \n \nIt could be argued from a pragmatic realistic perspective that the problems outlined in this section are \nnot sufficient, in themselves, to require a new philosophy of environmental modelling but merely \nreflect the technological constraints of today (computing limitations, measurement limitations, \ntheoretical limitations etc.).  The expectation is that new technological developments in computing and \nmeasurement will reduce the significance of today\u2019s problems.  There is always the hope of unforeseen \ntechnological innovation, but this argument does not survive a examination of the effects of trying to \napply models to specific locations with their own unique characteristics. \n 8 \n3.  Uniqueness of place in environmental modelling \n \nIn any application of a model, it is necessary to specify the boundary conditions and auxiliary \nconditions before we can implement a quantitative simulation and make predictions for a particular \nlocation with its own unique characteristics.  The problem arises even in the most trivial ways.  In \nhydrology, for example, the conservation of mass is a basic principle that is accepted by all models.  \nNo hydrologist or hydrological modeller would seriously question that principle.  However, to \ndemonstrate that principle for a particular catchment area of any useful size is currently beyond our \nmeasurement capabilities.  Similarly no hydrologist or hydrological modeller would seriously question \nthe conservation of energy or Newton\u2019s second law of motion as principles controlling the movement \nof water within the landscape, but the application of those principles is even more fraught with \ndifficulty since energy is dissipated in the system in a way that is controlled by the auxiliary and \nboundary conditions in (nonlinear and nonstationary) ways that are very difficult to either measure or \npredict in detail.  Formulating the balance equations is itself a significant task (e.g. Reggiani et al., \n1998, 1999, 2000); defining the coefficients that control the fluxes in those equations to reflect the \nparticular characteristics of particular places with any precision is effectively still beyond us (Beven, \n2000, 2001b). \n \nTwo problems follow from the problems of representing the detailed effects of boundary and auxiliary \nconditions and their reflection in effective parameter values in a simulation model.  The first is that \nthere may be no way of uniquely defining model structures or parameter sets for a particular \napplication, even when significant quantities of data are available for model \u201ccalibration\u201d.  This is seen \nempirically as many different models giving simulation results that are consistent with the available \ndata (e.g. Spear et al., 1995; Beven et al., 2000).   Secondly, it must be appreciated that it is the \nparameter set that gives a good simulation. \n \nMany environmental modellers treat the first problem as a problem of identifiability.  This is \nessentially consistent with the same pragmatic realist view that the model is \u201crealistic\u201d in its equations \n(as far as is possible), but we may not have adequate data to properly determine the values of the \nparameters needed.  This underlies all statistical inference about parameter values, as embodied for \n 9 \nexample in the formulation of likelihood functions (though see Kennedy and O\u2019Hagan, 2001, for a \nrecent attempt to include simple model inadequacy effects within a Bayesian statistical framework).   \nStatistical estimation, usually by maximising the likelihood function, depends on the possibility of \ndefining an appropriate model of the simulation errors.  In many cases this is very difficult, particularly \nin systems with natural (random) boundary forcings, uncertain initial conditions, nonlinear responses \nand strange attractors, and time variable model structural error.  Thus it is common to simply maximise \nsome convenient objective function to calibrate parameters and then proceed to use these \u201coptimised\u201d \nvalues in simulation.  In doing so, it is sometimes overlooked that the calibrated values might be \ndependent on both the chosen objective function and the type and period of calibration data, as well as \nthe model structure itself.   \n \nThere may be many parameter values to calibrate.  Indeed the calibration problem is often \nunderdetermined with respect to the data available and the type of forcings in the calibration data, \nleading to problems of non-identifiability (a poorly defined optimum) and\/or non-uniqueness (multiple \nlocal optima).  These problems are endemic to environmental models.  Experience suggests that they \ndo not go away with increased physical realism of the model structure, nor with longer calibration data \nsets or multiple objective functions using different types of data.  Longer calibration periods and \nmultiple objectives can help, but increased physical realism can actually make the problem worse if \nmore complex process representations are added with more parameters that cannot be estimated \nindependently.  The perfect model, if it could be defined, would be likely to have a very large (semi-\ninfinite) number of parameters, and so would not be immune to such problems in applications to unique \nplaces with limited observations. \n \nOne interesting issue here is revealed by studies involving replicate measurements at different, similar,  \nsites.   This, in many areas of environmental science, is deemed to be good practice (see, for example, \nthe exhortations in Peters, 1991), although it is not always economically or technically feasible to do \nso.  However, for these open heterogeneous systems, even in the best designed replicate experiments, \nthe measured responses must inevitably reflect uniqueness of inputs, characteristics and measurement \nartefacts.  In some cases it has been shown that the differences between replicates may be large and \n 10 \ninconsistent over time periods (such as shown by the measurements of runoff and erosion from large \nnumbers of replicate plots in Hjelmfelt and Burwell, 1984 and Nearing et al., 1999).   \n \nThis implies that each replicate might require its own set(s) of local model parameters (see for example \nLamb et al., 1998).  The aim of the model, however, is not usually to predict the replicate responses \nexcept for evaluation purposes.  The aim of the model is rather to predict the response of all the \nunmeasured locations in the landscape, with their own unique characteristics.  In this context we should \nnot therefore expect a model to be more precise in its predictions than the expected or observed \nvariability between replicates at the same scale, while the deterministic prediction will, with almost \nperfect certainty, be wrong in any particular location. \n \nThis then has an important bearing on the second problem of finding a parameter set to represent a \nlocation, since it is quite common in applications of environmental models to take parameter values \nthat have been determined elsewhere under very specific conditions as the basis for estimating the \nvalues at a new site or time period.  Such values are often reported in the literature without a clear \nindication of how they were calibrated or back-calculated from data, what other parameters were also \ninvolved in the calibration, and what range of conditions were covered by the calibration data.  If \nidentifiability is a problem, then there is no guarantee that bringing together parameter values from \ndifferent sources to create a set of parameters for a simulation will lead to acceptable simulations \n(where acceptability might be defined with respect to potential variability amongst replicates), even if \nthose values of parameters have been shown to produce good results elsewhere.  The impact of the \nunique characteristics of that location on the effective parameters required by a model may be such as \nto require different sets of values. \n \nIndeed, Beven (1993, 2000) has suggested that a better approach to the identifiability problem is to \nrecognise explicitly that there may be multiple model representations that provide acceptable \nsimulations for any environmental systems.  This is the concept of equifinality (to distinguish it from \nnon-identifiability or non-uniqueness).  The identification problem is then a matter of differentiating \nbetween behavioural models expected to give acceptable simulations and non-behavioural models that \ncan be rejected.  It is a combination of model structure, the boundary conditions and the set of \n 11 \nparameter values that gives rise to a behavioural simulation, although the decision about whether a \nmodel is acceptable must be dependent on the choice of a criterion or criteria of acceptablity in the \nsame way that optimised parameter values depend on the choice of objective function and calibration \ndata.  Some data about a site will therefore be necessary to determine whether a model is behavioural \nor not.  This approach has been formalised in the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation \n(GLUE) methodology of Beven and Binley (1992; see also Beven et al., 2000; Beven and Freer, 2001).  \nAn approach based on the equifinality concept is intrinsically linked with predictive uncertainty since \nthere is now no longer just one prediction but rather there are multiple predictions from all the \nbehavioural models.  \n \nGLUE may be considered directly in the line of a Bayesian approach to science (Howson and Urbach, \n1993).  Indeed in its simplest form it represents a form of Bayesian averaging over all behavioural \nmodels and includes formal Bayesian approaches to mechanistic modelling as special cases (e.g. \nKrzysztofovitz, 1999).   In prediction, all the behavioural simulations may be used to make predictions \nand the predictions of each model can be weighted in accordance with how well that model has done in \npredicting past data.  These likelihood weights can be updated as new evaluation data become available \nto form a new posterior distribution of behavioural parameter sets.   Thus, in this approach, behavioural \nsimulations are only retained as long as they are consistent with the data available for evaluation.  Any \nlocal or global interactions between parameter values in producing an acceptable simulation should be \nimplicitly reflected in the set of behavioural models retained in this way.  The focus in the approach is \nfirmly on the data that will allow the conditioning process by which all feasible models are reduced to \nthe set of behavioural models.   The GLUE methodology has now been applied to a wide variety of \nenvironmental models (see Beven et al., 2000 for a recent summary). \n \nBayesian approaches have previously been interpreted in terms of anti-realist and instrumentalist \nphilosophies. The consequences of model equifinality clearly do create problems for a realist stance.  It \nis also clear, however, that the recognition of equifinality will not result in environmental modellers \ngiving up their pragmatic realism.  The fact that we cannot decide which is the model of the system \nwith all the idiosyncracies that are reality can be considered as only a reflection of decidability.  New \ndata sources should help make parameter values more identifiable (or constrain the set of behavioural \n 12 \nmodels).  One source of new data that has the potential to be particularly important in dealing with the \nproblem of uniqueness of place is remote sensing data.  Remote sensing does, after all, yield time \nsequences of spatial images of unique places (albeit with either limited spatial resolution or limited \ntime resolution).  Space, time and spectral resolutions will improve with the new generation of EOS \nsatellites being launched.  Yet it does not appear that remote sensing has yet had much impact on the \nuniqueness problem.  It is interesting to consider why. \n \nOne reason is that remote sensing rarely gives results of interest to the environmental modeller directly.  \nThe digital numbers of the images require interpretation.  In general, this will require a separate model \nwith its own parameters (and indeed, before the modeller even sees the digital numbers they will \ngenerally have been subjected to a corrective model with its own parameter values).  These models are \ngenerally used as if the parameters were known a priori but such models will also not be exempt from \ntime and space variability of parameter values and, indeed, the problem of equifinality.  An example is \ngiven by the identification of different bidirectional reflectance function (BDRF) coefficients by Lewis \net al. (1999) on the basis of high resolution multilook multispectral sensor images.  The results showed \nthat the optimal model structure, as well as the optimal model parameter values, could change from \npixel to pixel in the images.  This gives a simple indication of the potential for equifinality in this type \nof interpretative process with consequent uncertainty.  Such uncertainties are frequently ignored on the \nbasis that the values of parameters that have given acceptable results elsewhere must have some \nphysical significance.  This account takes no account of either the uniqueness of place or the \nimportance of parameter sets in inducing behavioural simulations. \n \nIt is true, however, that significant information on spatial patterns can be seen in remote sensing images \nand direct measurement of spatial patterns of (point scale) observables (e.g. Grayson and Bl\u00f6schl, \n2000).  Such spatial information should prove useful in many types of applications but, again,  may \nthen require local parameter values within a model structure to represent those local observations \ncreating further problems for model identifiability.  It is in a more explicit consideration of the \ninevitable uncertainties that arise from such considerations of uniqueness of place that the foundations \nof a new philosophy might lie. \n \n 13 \n4.  Environmental Modelling As Landscape Space to Model Space Mapping \n \nThe nature of environmental systems is such that they are not easily closed for direct scientific \nexperimentation.  Where direct experimentation is possible it is normally only at small scales and it has \noften proven difficult to take relationships and theories developed at these scales and apply them in the \nfield where so much of the characteristic nature of the real system remains unknowable.  Thus, resort is \nnormally made to experimentation in the form of monitoring (perhaps in response to experimental \nforcings) of the system in all its complexity and as open to external influences.  Yet, to develop and \napply environmental models some form of closure must be enforced.  Thus, on the one hand we have \nthe real \u201clandscape space\u201d, and on the other a closed \u201cmodel space\u201d that is constructed so as to have \n(hopefully) an adequate range of functional responses.  The landscape space cannot be known perfectly \nsince even our perceptual model may be, as yet, inadequate and subject to change over time.  The \nmodel space, however, can be known perfectly for deterministic models with specified boundary \nconditions and its response to different types of forcing can be explored perfectly (within the \nlimitations of computer resources).  This can be extended to models with stochastic inputs and outputs, \nat least in principle, but at the expense of more computer resources.   It is, again, analogous to the \nnomological system of Cartwright (1999) in that it is a formal definition of the capacities of the \nprocesses described in the model and within which the model constructs have validity (here, by \ndefinition).  It must be recognised that the model space may not cover all eventualities that might arise \nin reality, but that if information becomes available about such eventualities then it might lead to a \nrevision of the feasible model space.   \n \nThus the modelling problem can be formulated in terms of a mapping of the \u201clandscape\u201d, the prototype \nsystem or part of nature of interest, into a high dimensional model space, where the dimensions might \ninclude various parameters, various boundary conditions and, in the general case, various competing \nmodel structures.  This mapping will be necessarily uncertain (or fuzzy).  Initially it can be done on the \nbasis of prior estimates of the appropriate model structure(s), boundary conditions and parameter \nvalues.  The choice, for example of a single model structure, single set of boundary conditions and \nsingle set of parameter values for a \u201clandscape unit\u201d (such as a GCM grid scale land surface \nparameterisation) is then equivalent to mapping that landscape unit to a single point in the model space.  \n 14 \nIf the model is run deterministically then there is only one possible set of outcomes.  This is a very \ncommon modelling practice but the possibilities for uncertainty in such a restricted mapping have been \nrevealed, for example, in the Project for the Intercomparison of Land surface Parameterisations \n(PILPS) for GCMs, which reveals considerable variation between groups of modellers and models in \ntrying to represent the same landscape units (see for example, Lohmann et al., 1998).  The implication \nis that the particular choices made, for example, in running  GCM simulations might be, to some \nextent, unrealistic. \n \nIt really does seem that this mapping is generally being carried out in an overly deterministic way in \nmany such modelling studies.  This is understandable with the current generation of GCMs because \ncomputing constraints mean that there is no possibility of allowing for uncertainty in the mapping for \nevery process and every location (even though this carries the risk of the simulations being in error).  \nHowever, for many less computationally demanding models it would be possible to allow for an \nuncertain mapping.  Defining the likelihood function in a model parameter space in statistical \nmodelling is one such mapping, within which the covariation of the parameters in fitting the data can \nbe estimated.  The GLUE methodology can also be interpreted in this way.  It is normally applied using \nMonte Carlo simulation to sample the model space and some likelihood measure is calculated for each \nmodelled sample by a comparison of observed and predicted responses.  The values of the likelihood \nmeasure for each behavioural model representation of a landscape unit can then be used as weights in \nthe mapping process (Beven 2000, 2001b).  Those models that have done well in simulating that \nlandscape unit (in so far as it is possible to test performance given the available observations) will have \nthe greatest weight.   The set of weights represents the mapping of the landscape unit into the model \nspace.  Other, density dependent, sampling methods such as Latin Hypercube methods or Monte Carlo \nMarkov Chain methods can be used when there is strong prior evidence for the form of the mapping, \nthough such strong prior assumptions are often difficult to justify in applications to unique places. \n \nAn uncertain mapping will mean that a given (real) landscape unit might be represented by a cloud of \nsampled points in the model space rather than a single point.  It might even be represented by several \nnon-contiguous clouds of points in the model space where local interactions between parameter values \n(and possibly model structures) give rise to locally behavioural models (e.g. Spear et al., 1994).  Some \n 15 \nfeatures of the modelling process, such as the fact that quite different model structures might be equally \nconsistent with the observations and that parameters with the same name might require different values \nin different model structures, are easily handled within this framework.   \n \nThis mapping also has the features of a Bayesian methodology (Howson and Urbach, 1993).  It can be \nformulated purely on the basis of prior information.  If some observations on the prototype become \navailable they can be used to update the mapping and form a posterior distribution of the behavioural \nparameter sets (and possibly model structures).  Depending on the performance of the models in \nreproducing the functionality of the prototype, the posterior mapping may have less uncertainty than \nthe prior or sometimes more.  In some circumstances where the data show that the model does not have \nthe correct functionality, then the posterior set may be null.  However, in such cases the modeller \nshould have learned from such a process of rejection, as in any hypothesis testing methodology. \n  \n \n5.  Hypothesis testing and model validation in the face of equifinality \n \nThe idea of a landscape space to model space mapping outlined in the previous section requires an \nability to define those areas of the model space where behavioural models occur.  It also seems to be \nbased on a relativist philosophy since there is an implication that any ranking of the models in terms of \nsome likelihood measure (or true likelihood where this can be properly formulated) means that some \nmodels are rejected and, of the remainder, some are more likely than others and can therefore be given \nmore weight in prediction.  The behavioural models could also be viewed as multiple working \nhypotheses, some of which we have (slightly) more confidence in than others on the basis of the \nempirical evidence.    \n \nHowever, within this framework there is scope for refining the mapping with a view to imposing \nadditional constraints on the predictive uncertainty that is the consequence of an uncertain mapping.  \nThere are two ways in which this might be done.  The first is in a purely Bayesian updating sense, \nwaiting for additional observations or different types of observation to become available and then \nevaluating all the behavioural models in the model space to see if they remain consistent with the new \n 16 \ninformation (see for example the effect of adding a new type of information in Franks et al., 1998, in \nconstraining the feasible parameter sets in a hydrological modelling example). \n \nThe second might be more active.  Since the model space can actually be explored in terms of the \nresponses of all the behavioural models, these can be evaluated deductively in terms of function (e.g. \nthe predicted values of a particular output variable).  It might then be possible to formulate hypotheses \nthat differentiate behavioural models in terms of how they function, quite independently of any \nexperimentation on the prototype.  If testable hypotheses can be formulated, and the required \nobservations are made, then it will be possible to reject or falsify a subset of the behavioural models \nand thereby refine the predictive uncertainty.   Of course, not all the potentially differentiating \nhypotheses will be testable with current measurement technologies.  \n \nModels that survive such a test (i.e. continue to be considered behavioural) can be considered to have \nan increased level of confirmation as a result of this demonstration of empirical adequacy (van \nFraassen, 1980).  This is not the same as verification, as is evident from the fact that in most \napplications of environmental models there will continue to be a set of behavioural models (or none if \nwe look too closely).   The problem of verification in respect of environmental models has been \ndiscussed in detail by Oreskes et al. (1994) in a contribution from professional philosophers as a \nresponse to the evaluation of the predictions of groundwater models by practising environmental \nscientists (Konikow and Bredehoeft, 1992; Anderson and Woessner, 1992).  Oreskes et al. suggest that \nverification and validation of models of open natural systems is impossible, despite the widespread use \nof those words in the modelling literature.  Models of such systems may be non-unique and only a \nconditional confirmation is possible.   It is conditional because it may depend on errors in the model \nstructure(s), the calibration of parameters or other auxiliary conditions and may also depend on the \nperiod of data used in evaluation.  The approach proposed here is fully consistent with this \nconditionality while retaining the possibility of a realist perspective. \n \n \n \n \n 17 \n6. Explanatory depth and expecting the unexpected. \n \nThe unknowability inherent in uniqueness of place is a constraint on the explanatory depth of models \nas used in prediction about real places.  These models may aim to simulate the correct capacities of the \nunderlying, more fundamental, processes but there will be a limit on how far those capacities can be \nreproduced when they must be represented in terms of effective parameter values at the scale of the \nmodel, even if the fundamental principles embodied in the model equations were correct.  Again, the \nconceptual or formal model will be wrong and will be known to be wrong.   \n \nThis then poses two interesting questions.  The first is how approximate can a model be, and still retain \nan element of realism in explaining and predicting the quantities and fluxes of interest?  The user of the \nmodel predictions (and the modeller as instrumentalist) is not necessarily so interested in the \nexplanatory depth of the model as in its explanatory power for the phenomena being predicted; that is \nthe power to predict states and fluxes of real quantities, especially under different scenarios for the \nfuture.  The view is often expressed that a realist philosophy implies a reductionist progression to ever \nmore fundamental levels of epistemological and ontological levels of explanation.  This implies that \nrealism then requires explanatory depth, even if the stopping rules may be problem dependent.  It is not \nclear that this is actually a simple progression in the case of environmental prediction since it is \nnecessarily linked to the problems of formal model complexity and knowability of characteristics at \ndifferent scales.   Explanatory depth, however complex, does not necessarily imply explanatory power \nif there is a conflict between the formal model and the processes or characteristics of a particular \napplication.  In such a case, approximate models for which the parameters may be more easily \nidentified may be advantageous. \n \nThe second question is how far can models that are necessarily approximate be expected to predict the \nunexpected, i.e. modes of response of the system that have not yet been observed?  A fully realistic \nmodel should do this correctly.  An argument is therefore often used in model development that \nadditional processes and complexity perceived as having an effect in the real system should be \nrepresented in the model, even if only as phenomenological relationships of no great explanatory depth, \nbecause those processes might be important in predicting future responses.   Such an argument has led \n 18 \nto the great vertical complexity of land surface parameterisations used in GCMs, noted in Section 2 \nabove, at the expense of neglecting sub-grid scale spatial heterogeneity.  The explanatory depth of the \nvertically complex description may be greater for predictions at a point but the explanatory power at \nthe scale of the GCM grid (the scale at which predictions are required) has been significantly \ncompromised.   \n \nSimilar issues arise in a variety of other fields.  There is a description of mixing in river channels based \non turbulent shear in the vertical velocity profile that leads to a one-dimensional advection-dispersion \nequation (ADE).  The approach has been shown to give accurate predictions in laboratory flume \nexperiments and has been applied very widely in natural channels (Rutherford, 1994).   In many natural \nchannels, however, the ADE will give incorrect predictions.  While it has depth of interpretation in \nterms of fundamental mixing processes, it completely neglects the transverse mixing and internal shear \nzones that are important in controlling mixing in natural channels of irregular three-dimensional \ngeometries and boundary conditions (Young and Wallis, 1994). \n \nThe ADE has also been applied to the problem of predicting transport of solutes in porous media.  \nAgain it has been shown to give good predictions of solute breakthrough curves in laboratory columns \nof homogeneous media.  Adding terms to the ADE allows processes such as adsorption\/desorption to \nbe included so that a wider range of solute behaviours can be predicted.  It has been used very widely \nto predict transport of contaminants in real soil and groundwater systems, after some calibration of the \nparameters involved.   A interesting example of its application has been in the prediction of the \nmovement of highly sorptive contaminants (pesticides, herbicides, phosphorus) applied at the surface \nof the soil.  The predictions are that such contaminants will be retained in the near surface soil.  \nSampled vertical concentration profiles at study sites confirm this impression, with a rapid decline in \nmeasured concentrations down from the soil surface.  However, gradually other types of measurements \nrevealed that this was not the whole story.  Unexpectedly, pesticides, herbicides, phosphorus and other \ncontaminants were being found widely in field drainage waters, stream waters and at depth in \ngroundwaters.  The ADE, for which the advective term is based on a mean velocity, neglects the \npossibility of flow in preferential flow pathways in the natural soil structure that allow at least small \namounts of contaminant, possibly sorbed to colloidal material, to move rapidly to depth during \n 19 \nrainfalls.  Without expensive high frequency sampling in the field during storm periods this process \nwas not evident from the measurements. \n \nAll these examples show that when taking formal models into the environment and applying them to \nunique places, depth of interpretation should not be confused with explanatory depth of the real \nphenomena, nor with explanatory power in prediction.  All that can be demanded is consistency of \nexplanation at the scale of application, including consistency with perceptual understanding and \nobservations at larger and smaller scales.   The importance of preferential flow in contaminant transport \nshould not have been a surprise, for example.  It had already been recognised in experimental work by \nLawes et al. (1882) at Rothamsted and the translocation of clay particles in large pores had been \nrecorded from soil thin section work for over 100 years (see the review of preferential flow in Beven \nand Germann, 1982).   The unexpected may not always be so unexpected when we are forced to review \na model because of a failure in prediction. \n \nIn the context of the landscape to model space mapping approach proposed here, \u201cunexpected\u201d \npredictions in the model space can be evaluated, in so far as they are inherent in the model structure(s) \nconsidered.  This suggests that it might be dangerous to exclude models that are consistent with \nobservational data but lead to \u201cunexpected\u201d conclusions in prediction. (Is it still possible, for example, \nthat increasing greenhouse gas concentrations might accelerate the onset of a new ice age? Certain \nmodel parameterisations in the past predicted this.  They do not now form part of the consensus view of \nclimate change (IPCC, 2001) but is it that they have they now been invalidated, rejected as non-\nbehavioural for good reasons, or merely quietly forgotten?).   Indeed, such unexpected predictions \nmight prove to be a useful basis for the type of hypothesis testing described above, since they can \nsuggest ideas for experimentation where that is possible.  Where it is not possible then it may be just a \nquestion of monitoring and waiting for the unexpected.  All the time that the range of behavioural \nmodels remains behavioural then the predictions will appear to be acceptable.  If some models can be \nrejected on the basis of new, perhaps unexpected, data then perhaps the set of behavioural models can \nbe refined.  When the truly unexpected occurs and all the behavioural models must be rejected, then the \nscience will truly progress (even if only by considering more realistic auxiliary conditions, as noted by \nMorton, 1993). \n 20 \n \nThe unexpected may be the effects of human interference, either inadvertent or as a result of policy and \nmanagement.  Anthropogenic effects may change either the characteristics of the system or its \nboundary conditions at the scale of closure.  Often these impacts are not well quantified even in \nhindcasting and history matching (the construction of records of inputs of greenhouse gases into the \natmosphere since pre-industrial times is a good example of such uncertainties).  Thus, it may only be \npossible to treat such impacts as potential scenarios, giving potential outcomes but without any \nobjective estimation of the associated uncertainty.  Most predictions of the impacts of climate change \nare of this type and can be handled within the framework suggested here which can allow explicit \nsubjective evaluations of possible outcomes if necessary.     \n \nHowever, it has often been argued in predictive studies of the impacts of change that, even if our \nmodels are not strictly realistic in modelling current conditions, they can still be used to predict the \nrelative magnitude of change for different scenarios (for an example in the context of global \nenvironmental change see IPCC, 2001).  This would appear to be an extremely tenuous argument in the \ncontext of nonlinear systems.  It assumes, rather blithely, that although model structural error may \nmean that not all the nonlinear interactions in the modelled system are represented accurately under \ncurrent conditions, the potential for nonlinear change in those interactions under changed conditions \nwill be represented accurately.  In the words of the IPCC (2001, Box 3, p.49): \n \u201cThe differencing technique removes most of the effects of any artificial adjustments in the model \nas well as systematic errors that are common to both runs.\u201d  \n \nThey do, however, go on to recognise the problem of model structural error immediately: \n \n\u201cHowever, a comparison of different model results makes it apparent that the nature of some errors \nstill influences the outcome.\u201d  \n \nThus, in the context of the philosophy espoused here there is uncertainty with respect to model \nstructure that should lead to uncertainty in the predicted change under different scenarios.  It is, in fact, \nquite possible that the distribution functions for predicted variables under different scenarios may be \noverlapping.  This was shown by Cameron et al. (2000) for the case of changing flood frequencies \nunder different future climate scenarios.  They could, however, still interpret their results in terms of a \nchange in the risk of a given flood magnitude being exceeded.  \n \n 21 \nIn the Cameron et al. study only the inputs to the model were being changed, not the model parameter \nsets.  Consideration of change, for example, in land management and land surface responses to change \nin climate, might also require the estimation of changes in parameter values.  This is now much more \nproblematic since the point has already been made that the value of a parameter is strictly only \nsignificant in the context of the model structure and parameter set within which it was found to provide \nbehavioural simulations.  Changing m different parameter values of a model within a set that is \nbehavioural under past conditions to reflect a new set of conditions might not be so simple.  What is \nneeded is a m-dimensional transposition of that behavioural model in the model space to a new position \n(or multiple potential positions) that will properly reflect the new set of conditions, including the \npotential for different types of parameter interaction in the model structure. \n \n7.  Realism, relativism and the limits of predictability \n \nThe arguments presented above may be summarised in terms of the following principles:  \n1. that a formal environmental model can only ever be an approximation to the perceptual model of \nthe complex processes governing the response to some forcing; \n2. that places are unique in their characteristics and boundary conditions and their uniqueness is \ninevitably to some extent  unknowable; \n3. that there will then always be the possibility of equifinality in model representations of a system,  \nin that many different structures or parameter sets may give simulations that are acceptable \nrepresentations of the observations available; \n4. that the range of behavioural models is best represented in terms of an uncertain \u201clandscape space\u201d \nto model space mapping; \n5. that the range of predictive uncertainty associated with the set of behavioural models should \ntherefore be explored; and \n6. that observations will be crucial in constraining the set of behavioural models and gradually \nrefining understanding of the response of particular places. \n \nIt has been suggested that these principles provide the basis for a coherent philosophy for \nenvironmental modelling that allows for both the difficulties of decidability between different \n 22 \ncompeting model descriptions and the possibility of a scientific hypothesis testing approach to refining \nthe set of feasible models.  They imply that a realist approach to environmental modelling is \nproblematic, although they do not preclude it.   \n \nThey also imply some important practical problems for the application of environmental models.  They \nimply an evaluation of all feasible models, making use of all valuable information available about the \nprototype, including prior experience.  They imply predictions carried out using multiple behavioural \nmodels.  They imply explorations of the model space with a view to finding potentially testable \nhypotheses.  They imply lots of computer resources (although taking large numbers of samples from \nthe model space is feasible now for at least some models, see the applications in Beven et al., 2000).  \nThey imply that it may not always be possible to differentiate between competing models or, \nalternatively, that if we look in sufficient detail it might be possible to reject all the necessarily \napproximate models in the model space (see the example in Zak and Beven, 1999, in the context of \nmodelling critical loads for acid deposition).  It has already been noted that even if we knew a priori \nthe structure of the perfect model, it would not be immune to these problems because of difficulties in \nspecifying parameter values and boundary conditions in any application.  \n \nWhat then are the implications for modelling practice?  Clearly, many pragmatic realists and \ninstrumentalists continue to use a \u201cfit for purpose\u201d argument and retain only one \u201coptimal\u201d model as \nbeing the \u201cmost realistic\u201d available for the conditions under study.   It is relatively rare at present that \napplications take any account of modelling uncertainties.  They tend to be based rather on obtaining a \n\u201cbest estimate\u201d, perhaps with a certain amount of sensitivity analysis.  Where uncertainties are taken \ninto account (such as in the estimation of risk in the regulation of the nuclear industry) then the number \nof degrees of freedom involved means that usually only a priori estimates of uncertainty are included \nand that the possibility of covariation and interaction amongst parameters and other factors is \nnecessarily treated only very approximately, if at all.  Where it is possible to make statistical inferences \nabout model parameter values, applications often do not take account of model structural error or \nconsider the possibility of quite different predictions arising from different behavioural model \nstructures (but see, for example, Draper, 1995, for some interesting examples of doing so). \n \n 23 \nSuch practices seem to have important limitations.  However, taking more realistic account of the \ninherent uncertainties in modelling the environment is not only a matter of devoting greater effort and \ncomputer resources but involves a variety of other issues in the sociology of science, policy and \ndecision making.  These elements are often very closely linked (for discussions see, Gare, 1995 and \nRavetz, 1996).  A very brief summary of the issues in this context could perhaps be presented in the \nform that there will be no requirement to take a more realistic account of uncertainty until the users \n(policy formulators and decision makers) demand it, and that such users are concerned that \u201ctoo much \nuncertainty\u201d in the science will not be helpful in either policy formulation or decision making \n(especially if the scientific models are considered to be only socially conditioned constructs anyway, \nsee for example, Ravetz, 1996; Schrader-Frechette, 1985).   The science must evolve in this context.  \nThe evolving uncertainty estimates in measures of climate change as summarised by the IPCC are an \ninteresting case in point here (see Shackley et al., 1997).   Such predictions are necessarily the result of \nonly a few GCM scenarios, but in other application areas it is clear that the possibility of doing many \ndifferent model runs is now technically feasible.  They are just not usually demanded. \n \nThe philosophy for environmental modelling that is being suggested here aims to extend the pragmatic \nrealism that underlies much of the current work in both research and practical prediction with a more \nrealistic account of uncertainty, formulated here in terms of a concept of  landscape to model space \nmapping.  As such, it is a reflection not only of practical modelling experience but also of some of the \ncurrent discussions of uncertainty that have arisen out of concepts of nonlinear dynamics and \ncomplexity in open systems (e.g. Ruelle, 1991; Prigogine, 1997; Rescher, 1998) in which chance \neffects and the self-organisation of (simple) nonlinear dynamic systems interact to produce the \nobserved complexity of the real world emergent at the scales of interest.  Uncertainty then arises from \nthe sensitivity of such systems to initial conditions (especially where there is a tendency to chaotic \nbehaviour) and the problem of trying to mimic the real attractor of the system (Smith, 2001).  The types \nof parameter estimation problem described above, that are endemic to models of open environmental \nsystems in particular places, will then only add to the uncertainties.  Such concepts, together with \nstochastic modelling approaches and \u201cdominant mode\u201d data-based modelling (e.g. Young, 2000; 2001), \nare easily encompassed within the philosophy outlined, albeit that there may be practical limitations in \nrealising all the possibilities involved.   \n 24 \n \nThus, a formulation in terms of a landscape to model space mapping is not inconsistent with a realist \nstance (in the sense, for example, of Bhaskar,1980, 1989, and Chalmers, 1989), or of  a relaxed form of \nPopperian falsificationism (Popper, 1959, 1979), whilst recognising that the approach towards a single \nrealist description of any environmental system will be fraught with difficulty since, in most practical \napplications,  it is all too easy to falsify all the available models if they are evaluated in detailed.  Less \nsevere criteria for falsification then results in an equifinality of model representations which may be \nviewed as a variation on the underdetermination thesis (van Fraassen, 1980; Newton-Smith, 1981, \n2000), applied to a restricted range of potentially realistic models rather than theories.  It would seem \nthat the attention given to particular places in the landscape to model space mapping makes such a \nrealist interpretation more easily tenable, since the aim of the modeller is then to achieve a \nprogressively realistic representation of those places within the limitations of currently available \nmodelling and observational techniques.  However, the approach is also flexible enough to allow \nrelativist or instrumentalist interpretations if it is believed that a realist description will prove ultimately \nimpossible.  Consequently, it reflects the immaturity of the environmental sciences that should, we \nhope, evolve with the development of new techniques for observing and characterising the systems and \nplaces of interest.  Yet it does not seem that this would dramatically change the underlying \nphilosophical approach suggested here which does, at least, give some guidance about the need to be \nspecific and explicit in the form of mapping used.  In this respect, it provides a scientific basis for the \ndiscussion and comparison of environmental models in applications to unique places, without too much \nneed for self-delusion in presenting the value of model representations of complex environmental \nsystems. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe ideas in this paper have benefited from discussions with a wide variety of colleagues and students \nover a long period of time.
