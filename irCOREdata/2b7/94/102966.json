These features\ninclude high data rates, low power consumption, multiple access\ncommunications, and precise positioning capabilities. Space-time\ncoding techniques, such as the block coding scheme or the trellis\ncoding scheme, are known to be simple and practical ways to\nincrease both the spectral efficiency and the capacity in wireless\ncommunications. So far, few contributions have looked over\nmultiple inputs multiple outputs UWB systems. In this paper,\na method to adapt the space-time block coding technique to\nsingle band UWB signalling is proposed. A space-time block\ncodec, based on orthogonal pulses to achieve spatial diversity\nand collect the multipath diversity is developed. A theoretical\nanalysis is conducted to enlighten the performance enhancements\nprovided by the proposed scheme compared to the classic single\nlink scheme. Simulations support analysis, for various numbers of\ntransmit and receive antennas, several types of channel scenarios,\nand different detection techniques. In a typical studied UWB\nenvironment, the results revealed that our proposed scheme\nimproves the bit error rate performances compared to those of\na single link scheme and it provides a strong immunity against\ntiming jitter.\nIndex Terms\u2014Ultra wide-band communication systems, im-\npulse radio, space-time block coding, diversity, rake receiver,\npulse position modulation\nI. INTRODUCTION\nImpulse radio (IR), also known as single band ultra wide-\nband (UWB), is defined as a form of ultra-wide bandwidth\nsignalling which is well designed for base-band asynchronous\nmultiple access (MA), short distance-high data rate multimedia\nservices, and tactical wireless communications [1]. Differ-\nent approaches have been already investigated in order to\ndeploy a UWB system. These include a multi-band carrier-\nbased approach supported by multi-carrier spread spectrum\nand a single band approach implemented via pulse position\nmodulation (PPM), pulse amplitude modulation, pulse shape\nmodulation or a combination of them [2]. In addition, random\ntime-hopping (TH) or direct sequence (DS) codes are used\nto allow secure multiple user transmissions [3]. The analysis\npresented hereafter, considers a UWB communication system\nbased on the single band UWB approach.\nMultiple-inputs-multiple-outputs systems are known to pro-\nvide higher capacity and therefore better performances than\nsingle link (SL) systems in wireless communications by em-\nploying multiple transmit, and optionally, multiple receive\nantennas. Most popular of them, such as space-time block\nF. He\u00b4liot, M. Ghavami and M. R. Nakhai are with the Centre for\nTelecommunications Research, King\u2019s College London, University of Lon-\ndon, Division of Engineering, Strand, London WC2R 2LS, UK (e-mail:\nF.Heliot@Surrey.ac.uk).\ncoding (STBC) [4], [5], space-time trellis coded modulation\n[6], and layered space-time architectures [7], can provide\nhigh data rates with a given transceiver complexity. With 3G\nsystems and beyond requiring high data rates for applications\nsuch as multimedia, this particular area of research has gained\na lot of interest.\nA multi-antenna architecture for UWB systems was first\nintroduced in [8], where an Alamouti based STBC scheme [4]\nwith two transmit antennas and one receive antenna is used\nover a simple channel model. This work was then extended\nin [9] to include performance assessments over a narrow\nband indoor channel model. Both works exhibit performance\nimprovements compared to the SL-IR scheme, in terms of\nbit error rate (BER). In [10], we combined a multi-antenna\nsingle band UWB STBC (STBC-IR) system with orthogonal\npulses to enhance the data rate. In this paper, we modify the\nscheme introduced in [10] and we propose a different method\nfrom the one presented in [9] to achieve spatial diversity\nregardless of the number of transmit and receive antennas.\nWe developed our scheme for both non-coherent reception\n(NCR) and coherent reception (CR). In the case of CR, a\nfractionally spaced (FS) rake receiver with Fg fingers and\na maximum ratio combining (MRC) detector are used to\ncollect the multipath diversity. As a particular significance\nof our work, we investigate the performance analysis of our\nscheme over a realistic single band UWB channel model,\ni.e., the IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel model, reported in\n[11]. We derive our scheme mathematically based on this\nchannel model. Then, we analytically determine upper bounds\non the maximum achievable performances in terms of BER.\nNext, we assess the theoretical reachable diversity gain of\nour scheme and we compare it via analysis to the one of\nany SL-IR scheme. Finally, we confirm our theoretical results\nnumerically, for various transmission scenarios, through Monte\nCarlo simulations.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows, Section II\nbriefly introduces the IR-MA model, with both DS-UWB\nand TH-UWB as multiple access techniques. It also presents\na detailed analysis in terms of channel model, transceiver\nstructure and detection methods for a standard single-input-\nsingle-output (SISO) IR system. In Section III, an overview\nof modified Hermitian pulses (MHPs) [2] is given. Then, a\ncomprehensive derivation of our STBC-IR scheme is carried\nout for a general multi-antenna configuration. In Section\nIV, simulation parameters are presented and performances\nare assessed in terms of BER. Results from Monte Carlo\nsimulations are plotted and compared with their theoretical\ncounterparts. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.\n2II. SYSTEM MODEL FOR SISO IR-MA\nA. IR-MA signaling model\nThis part of the paper briefly describes the IR-MA signalling\nmodel [3]. The transmitted signal \u03c9u(t), from the uth user to\nany other user, can be described as a train of short pulses w(t),\nwhere Tw is the width of each pulse within the train. Each\ntransmitted symbol is represented by several similar pulses.\nEach of this pulse is transmitted within a frame. The duration\nof a frame is denoted Tf , where Tf \u2265 Tw. The number of\nframes per transmitted symbol is Nf . Therefore, the duration\nof each symbol Ts is such as Ts = NfTf . If Nu users are\naccommodated applying TH codes, then the frame duration\nTf can expressed such as Tf = NcTc + Tg, where Nc is\nthe number of chips within the frame, Tc is the chip duration\nand Tg is a guard period for processing delay. Each frame\ncontains only one pulse per user. Considering a single band\nM -ary PPM TH-UWB communication system, where packets\nof Ns symbols are transmitted, the mathematical expression\nof the uth user transmitted signal at any time t is given by\n\u03c9u(t) =\n\u221a\n\u000fu\nNs\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nw (t\u2212 (iNf + k)Tf\n\u2212Cu(k)Tc \u2212 TIu(i)\n) , (1)\nwhere \u000fu is the uth user transmitted symbol energy, Cu(k)\nis a Np periodic TH pseudo-random code, such as Cu(k) \u2208\n{0, Nc \u2212 1}, Iu(i) represents the information bearing the ith\ntransmitted symbol sent by the uth user, Iu(i) \u2208 {0,M \u2212\n1}, and TIu(i) is the delay related to Iu(i). Considering a\nM -ary orthogonal PPM (OPPM), this delay can be expressed\nsuch as TIu(i) = (Iu(i)\/M)Ts. This delay represents the pulse\nposition shift in the set of all possible position shifts, according\nto the M -ary modulation. Otherwise, one can also combine DS\ncodes with UWB system to accommodate several users. In that\ncase, Cu(k) is called the direct spread sequence coefficient,\nand Cu(k) = \u00b11. Considering a single band M -ary PPM DS-\nUWB communication system, the uth transmitted signal can\nbe expressed such as\n\u03c9u(t)=\n\u221a\n\u000fu\nNs\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nCu(k)w\n(\nt\u2212 (iNf + k)Tf \u2212 TIu(i)\n)\n.\n(2)\nThe number of users accommodated and the level of inter-\nsymbol interferences (ISI) can be tuned via the pulse repetition\ngain, which is equal to 10 log10 (Nf ) and the duty cycle\ngain, which is equal to 10 log10\n(\nTf\nTw\n)\n. A low repetition gain\nimplies more ISI, multiple user collisions and synchronization\nproblems. A high repetition gain implies a lower data rate.\nConsidering the TH-UWB MA technique, a low duty cycle\nprovides a good protection against catastrophic collisions in a\nmulti-user environment [3].\nB. Single link Configuration\nA detailed analysis of a SISO single band UWB communi-\ncation system is undertaken here. Several aspects of the system\nare studied in this Section such as the transceiver architecture,\nthe propagation medium and different detection methods.\nAt any given time, a bit stream flows toward the input\nof the system. Each bit is mapped into a symbol via a\nM -level modulator. Then, each symbol is shaped into its\ncorresponding waveform via a pulse shaper, depending on\nthe type of modulation and the multiuser technique chosen.\nAssuming packets of Ns symbols are encoded through a M -\nary orthogonal pulse position modulator (Tf = MTw) and\nthey are transmitted via a DS-UWB communication system,\nthe expression of the uth user transmitted signal per symbol i\nat any time t is given by\n\u03c9u(t, i)=\n\u221a\n\u000fu\nNf\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nCu(k)w (t\u2212([iM+Iu(i)]Nf+k)Tw) ,\n(3)\nwhere w(t) is a normalised to unit-energy pulse(\u222b Tf\n0\nw2(t) = 1\n)\n,\n\u221a\n\u000fu\/Nf is a normalization coefficient,\nand i \u2208 {0, Ns \u2212 1}. The signal \u03c9u(t, i) will be distorted\nduring its transmission. In a single band UWB typical\nenvironment (indoor environment), the Doppler spectrum is\nquasi-constant. Therefore, the propagation medium can be\nlabelled as a very slow fading channel, and it can be modelled\nby a finite impulse response signal [11]\nh(t) = X\nP\u22121\u2211\np=0\nQ\u22121\u2211\nq=0\n\u03b1p,q\u03b4 (t\u2212 Tp \u2212 \u03c4p,q) , (4)\nwhere \u03b1p,q = \u03b2p,qej\u03b8p,q is the multipath gain of ray q within\nthe pth cluster with \u03b2p,q being log-normally distributed and\n\u03b8p,q = 0 or pi, Tp is the arrival time of the first ray of the\npth cluster and \u03c4p,q is the delay of the qth ray within the pth\ncluster relative to the first ray arrival time of that cluster. X\nmodels the log-normal shadowing, X = 10(Y\/20), where Y\nfollows a normal distribution, with 0 dB mean value and 3 dB\nstandard deviation. The model in (4) is the IEEE 802.15.3a\nUWB channel model [11] and it is based on the Saleh-\nValenzuela model [12]. Considering perfect synchronization,\nthe uth user received signal ru(t, i) per transmitted symbol is\nsimply the convolution of \u03c9u(t, i) with the channel impulse\nresponse h(t), plus an additive gaussian noise n(t) with two-\nsided power spectral density N0\/2 as follows\nru(t, i) = X\nP\u22121\u2211\np=0\nQ\u22121\u2211\nq=0\n\u03b1p,q\u03c9u (t\u2212 Tp \u2212 \u03c4p,q, i) + n(t). (5)\nAt this stage, both NCR and CR techniques can be used\nto retrieve transmitted symbols within the received signal. A\ncoherent receiver needs to estimate the channel parameters\n\u03b1p,q, Tp, \u03c4p,q , for instance by applying the matched filter\ntechnique along with a FS-rake receiver and exploiting data\naided (DA) channel estimation [13]. Each estimation of the\nsignal h(t) is denoted by h\u02dc(t) and expressed as\nh\u02dc(t) = X\u02dc\nFg\u22121\u2211\nf=0\n\u03b1\u02dcf\u03b4 (t\u2212 \u03c4\u02dcf ) , (6)\nwhere Fg is the number of fingers of the FS-rake receiver,\nX\u02dc is the estimation of the shadowing effects, \u03b1\u02dcf is the f -\nth estimated multipath gain of the estimated channel impulse\n3response and \u03c4\u02dcf is the estimated delay of the corresponding\nmultipath gain. At the receiver side, the multiuser waveform\nof the desired user u is generated according to\n\u03c9u(t, i,m) =\n\u221a\n1\nNf\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nCu(k)w(t\u2212([iM +m]Nf +k)Tw),\n(7)\nwhere m \u2208 {0,M \u2212 1}. The convolution of \u03c9u(t, i,m) with\nh\u02dc(t) produces an estimated template waveform sCR u(t, i,m)\nper user, per transmitted symbol and per possible position as\nfollows\nsCR u(t, i,m) = X\u02dc\nFg\u22121\u2211\nf=0\n\u03b1\u02dcf\u03c9u(t\u2212 \u03c4\u02dcf , i,m). (8)\nNext, the correlation between the received signal ru(t, i) and\neach possible sCR u(t, i,m) is performed for each transmitted\nsymbol over Ts + \u03c4\u02dcFg\u22121, where Ts = MNfTw and \u03c4\u02dcFg\u22121 is\nthe greatest delay of h\u02dc(t). Thus, a decision statistic towards\nthe decoding of the ith transmitted symbol is provided by\n\u039bu(i,m) =\n\u222b (iM+m+1)NfTw+\u03c4\u02dcFg\u22121\n(iM+m)NfTw\nru(t, i)sCR u(t, i,m)dt.\n(9)\nIn the case of NCR, a known waveform is transmitted at the\nbeginning of each new packet through the slow fading channel\nmodelled according to [11]. The known received waveform\nsNCR u(t) can be expressed as\nsNCR u(t) = X\n\u221a\n\u000fu\nNf\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nP\u22121\u2211\np=0\nQ\u22121\u2211\nq=0\n\u03b1p,q\n\u00d7Cu(k)w(t \u2212 Tp \u2212 \u03c4p,q \u2212 kTw) + n\u2032(t)\n, (10)\nwhere n\u2032(t) is an additive gaussian noise with two-sided\npower spectral density N0\/2. Then, M translated replicas\nof sNCR u(t) for the ith transmitted symbol are generated\naccording to\nsNCR u(t, i,m) =\n\u222b\nR\n\u03b4(t\u2212 (iM +m)NfTw \u2212 \u03c4)sNCR u(\u03c4)d\u03c4.\n(11)\nNext, the correlation between the received signal ru(t, i) and\neach possible sNCR u(t, i,m) is performed for each transmitted\nsymbol over Ts. A decision statistic towards the decoding of\nthe ith transmitted symbol is given by\n\u039bu(i,m) =\n\u222b (iM+m+1)NfTw\n(iM+m)NfTw\nru(t, i)sNCR u(t, i,m)dt. (12)\nEventually, we perform the maximum-likelihood (ML) detec-\ntion by searching for the location m which maximized \u039b(i,m)\nsuch as\nIu(i) = argmax\nm\n[\u039bu(i,m)] . (13)\nFrom this general analysis of the SISO-IR scheme, we derive\ntwo theoretical upper bounds on the average bit-error prob-\nability according to the type of reception performed (CR or\nNCR). These bounds will prove valuable to compare the SL-\nIR scheme and the STBC-IR scheme in terms of achievable\nperformances, later in this paper. Each upper bound is related\nto a M -ary orthogonal signal, with a different noise charac-\nteristic as described in the following\n1) Assumption 1: Considering a peer-to-peer communica-\ntion, we achieve maximum performances in terms of diversity\nwhen a coherent receiver is used, a perfect channel estimation\nis assumed (\u03b1\u02dcf = \u03b1f , \u03c4\u02dcf = \u03c4f ), a large-enough value of Nf\nis considered to avoid ISI, and finally there exists Fg uncorre-\nlated resolvable multipath components such that Tf \u2265 FgTw,\n\u03c4f+1 \u2212 \u03c4f \u2265 Tw, to avoid intra-pulse interferences (IPI).\nUnder these highly theoretical assumptions [14], \u039b(i,m) can\nbe expressed as\n\u039b(i,m) = X2\n\u221a\n\u000fs\u03b4(I(i)\u2212m)\nFg\u22121\u2211\nf=0\n\u03b12f\n+X\n\u221a\n1\nNf\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nFg\u22121\u2211\nf=0\n\u03b1fn(i, k, \u03c4f ,m)\n, (14)\nwhere \u000fs is the transmitted symbol energy. The variance\nof the total received noise per transmitted symbol, taking\ninto account the matched filter process [15], is given by\n\u03c32s = X\n2N0\/2\n\u2211Fg\u22121\nf=0 \u03b1\n2\nf . According to the symbol-error\nprobability for a M -ary orthogonal signal [15]\nPM\n(\nI(i)\u2192 I(i)|\u03b1f , f = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Fg \u2212 1\n)\n< M\nFg\u22121\u220f\nf=0\nexp\n(\u2212X2\u000fs\u03b12f\/2N0) . (15)\nIn deriving (15), it is assumed that random variables \u03b1f\nare uncorrelated with one another [11], and follow a log-\nnormal (E\u03b1f , \u03c3\u03b1) distribution. Therefore, the random variable\n\u03b12f follows a log-normal (2E\u03b1f , 2\u03c3\u03b1) distribution. Averaging\n(15) with respect to \u03b12f , we obtain an upper bound on the\naverage bit-error probability as follows\nPb\n(\nI(i)\u2192 I(i))\n< C\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\u0393(1 +K)\u221api\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8edX2\u03b5s\n2N0\n\uf8ee\uf8f0Fg\u22121\u220f\nf=0\ne2E\u03b1f\n\uf8f9\uf8fb\n1\nFg\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\u2212K\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nFg\n,\n(16)\nwhere C = M2(log2(M)\u22121)\/(2log2(M) \u2212 1), K =\n1\/2\n\u221a\n2\u03c3\u03b1, and \u000fs\/N0 is defined as the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) per symbol. According to (16), a diver-\nsity advantage of KFg and a coding advantage of\nX2\/2 (\u0393(1 +K)\/\n\u221a\npi)\n\u2212 1\nK\n[\u220fFg\u22121\nf=0 e\n2E\u03b1f\n] 1\nFg\nare achieved. A\ncomprehensive derivation from (15) to (16) is provided in the\nAppendix.\n2) Assumption 2: Considering a peer-to-peer communica-\ntion with resolvable multipath components, applying NCR and\nassuming a large value for Nf to avoid ISI, we approximate\nthe symbol-error probability at high SNR (\u000fs \u001d N0) by\nPM\n(\nI(i)\u2192 I(i)|\u03b1p,q, p, q = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , P \u2212 1, Q\u2212 1\n)\n< M\nP\u22121\u220f\np=0\nQ\u22121\u220f\nq=0\nexp\n(\u2212X2\u000fs\u03b12p,q\/4N0) . (17)\nFinally, averaging (17) with respect to \u03b12p,q, we derive an upper\nbound on the average bit-error probability at high SNR as\n4- 8\n- 6\n- 4\n- 2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nA\nm\np\nlit\nu\nd\ne\nx104\n0\n0.1\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\ntime, ns\nMHP, n = 1\nMHP, n = 2\nMHP, n = 3\nMHP, n = 4\nFig. 1.

Since NCR provides a better\nachievable diversity advantage, it might provide better per-\nformances at higher SNR than CR according to the value of\nE\u03b1p,q . Although our bounds in (16) and (18) seem to be highly\ntheoretical as they do not take into account IPI effects which\nare prominent effects of the channel model implemented here,\nthey are suitable to assess the trend of achievable performances\nat high SNR, as we show later in Section IV-B.\nIII. STBC-IR SCHEME WITH ORTHOGONAL PULSES\nLet us now present our STBC-IR scheme combined with\northogonal pulses. So far, several classes of orthogonal pulses\nsuch as MHPs [2], orthogonal pulses based on wavelet packets\n[16], and orthogonal pulses based on prolate spheroidal wave\nfunctions [17] have already been developed. The STBC-IR\nscheme presented later in this section can be implemented\nregardless of the type of orthogonal pulses.\nA. Modified Hermitian Pulses\nThe modified Hermitian set of orthogonal pulses retained\nour attention owing to the attractive features it provides, and\nits simplicity of implementation [2]. Each normalised to unit-\nenergy pulse time-domain expression is given by\n\u03c5n(t) =\n\u221a\n2(\u22121)nT (n\u2212\n1\n2 )\n0\n(8pi)\nn\n2\n\u221a\nn!\ne\n2pi\n(\nt\u2212T1\nT0\n)\n2 dn\ndtn\ne\n\u22124pi\n(\nt\u2212T1\nT0\n)\n2\n,\n(19)\n-140\n-135\n-130\n-125\n-120\n-115\n-110\n-105\n-100\n-95\n-90\n0 2 4 6 8\nFrequency, GHz\nM\na\ng\nn\nit\nu\nd\ne \nsp\nec\ntr\nu\nm\n, d\nB\nMHP, n = 1\nMHP, n = 2\nMHP, n = 3\nMHP, n = 4\nFig. 2. Magnitude spectrum of normalised to unit-energy MHPs of order n\n= 1, 2, 3, 4, for T0 = 0.2877 ns and T1 = 0.35 ns.\nwhere n is the order of the pulse, T0 defines the width of the\npulse and T1 determines the center of the pulse. The magnitude\nspectrum of each normalised to unit-energy MHP is given by\n\u03a5n(f) =\njnF\n(n\u2212 12 )\n0\n(2pi)\nn\n2\n\u221a\nn!\ne\n2pi\n((\nf\n2F0\n)\n2\n\u2212jfT1\n)\ndn\ndfn\ne\n\u2212pi\n(\nf\nF0\n)\n2\n, (20)\nwhere F0 = 1\/T0. Depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are the\ntime response and the magnitude spectrum of normalised to\nunit-energy\u2019 MHPs, for different values of n. Otherwise, as\nreported in [18], the orthogonality between each MHP can be\nconserved at the receiver side, taking into account distortional\nantenna effects, via a modification of each MHP shape at the\ntransmitter side.\nB. STBC-IR scheme\nThe STBC-IR scheme derivation is carried out considering\na Nt transmit, N\u03c1 receive antenna configuration, a peer-to-\npeer communication, and symbols encoded through a M -ary\nOPPM. The system model chart of our STBC-IR scheme is\ndepicted in Fig. 3. Similar to the SL-IR scheme, bits are\nfirst mapped into symbols. Then, the \u2018symbol stream\u2019 is split\ninto Nt sub-streams, enabling the transmission of Nt different\nsymbols on Nt transmit antennas. Next, each symbol sub-\nstream is shaped into its corresponding waveform \u03c9n(t, i) via\na PPM-encoder and using Nt MHP shapers. The transmitted\nsignal sent over the nth transmit antenna is expressed as\n\u03c9n(t, i) =\n\u221a\n\u000fs\nNtNf\nNt\u22121\u2211\nl=0\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c5c(t\u2212 ([b+ I(a)]Nf + k)Tw),\n(21)\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3 a = iNt + c,b = (iNt + l)M,\nc = (Nt \u2212 l+ n) mod Nt,\nwhere\n5M-level\nencoder\nHermitian pulse\nbits S\/P\nconverter\ntI(iN )\ntI((i+1)N -1)\nPulse shaper\n&\nST encoder\nH(t)\n(t,a,b)c\u03c5\n(t)\n0\n    (t)\nN  -1t\nr (t)\n0\nRake receiver\n&\nmatched filters\nChanel estimator\ns         (t,i,m)\n~\nCR p,n\nmatched signal\nr     (t)\nN  -1p\nM\nR\nC\n(iN ,m)t\nML detector\nI(j)\nH(t)\n~\n((i+1)N -1,m)t\nML detector\nP\/S\nconverter\ntI(iN )\ntI((i+1)N -1)\nI(j)\n_\n_\n_\nRake & filters\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 \u039b\n\u039b\n(t,a,b)n\u03c5\nFig. 3. Block diagram of the Nt transmit antennas, N\u03c1 receive antennas, space-time block coding scheme with orthogonal pulses for single band UWB\ncommunications.\n\u2022 I(a) represents the genuine \u2018symbol stream\u2019 before the\nsplitting operation,\n\u2022 a defines the index of any symbol within the \u2018symbol\nstream\u2019,\n\u2022 b determines the position of the waveform representing\nI(a) within the aggregate signal,\n\u2022 c is the order of the MHP used to transmit I(a),\n\u2022 n \u2208 {0, Nt \u2212 1}, i \u2208\n{\n0, NsNt \u2212 1\n}\n,\n\u2022\n\u221a\n\u000fs\nNf\nis an energy normalization term, and 1\u221a\nNt\nguaran-\ntees a total transmitted power equal to the one considered\nin a SL communication system.\nEquation (21) describes mathematically how the encoding\nprocess is performed for each antenna. It emphasises that\nencoding is performed at the same time in space and time do-\nmains. Moreover, contrarily to a classic block coding scheme\nimplemented in [9], where for most of transmit antenna\nconfigurations (Nt = 3, 5, 6, 7, . . .) the length of the block\ncode used has to be greater than Nt [5], the length of our\nblock code is always equal to Nt. For instance, considering\nNt = 5, our scheme provides a data rate which is 1.6 times\nfaster than the one provides by a usual block coding scheme.\nEach uncorrelated channel link between the nth transmit\nand the \u03c1th receive antenna is modelled by a finite impulse\nresponse signal h\u03c1,n(t) such as\nh\u03c1,n(t) = X\nP\u22121\u2211\np=0\nQ\u22121\u2211\nq=0\n\u03b1\u03c1,n,p,q\u03b4 (t\u2212 T\u03c1,n,p \u2212 \u03c4\u03c1,n,p,q) . (22)\nThe received signal per receive antenna, per transmitted sym-\nbol r\u03c1(t, i) can then be described by:\nr\u03c1(t, i) = X\nNt\u22121\u2211\nn=0\nP\u22121\u2211\np=0\nQ\u22121\u2211\nq=0\n\u03b1\u03c1,n,p,q\u03c9n(t\u2212T\u03c1,n,p\u2212\u03c4\u03c1,n,p,q, i)+n\u03c1(t),\n(23)\nwhere n\u03c1(t) is a zero-mean gaussian noise with variance\nN0\/2. In order to perform the detection on each transmitted\nsymbol, the same kind of approach applied to the SL-IR\nscheme is extended. For CR, a DA channel estimation is\nconsidered, and the estimated channel impulse response of\neach possible link h\u02dc\u03c1,n(t) = X\u02dc\n\u2211Fg\u22121\nf=0 \u03b1\u02dc\u03c1,n,f \u03b4(t \u2212 \u03c4\u02dc\u03c1,n,f )\nis acquired, where \u03b1\u02dc\u03c1,n,f is the f th estimated multipath gain\nof the estimated channel impulse response and \u03c4\u02dc\u03c1,n,f is the\nestimated delay of the corresponding multipath gain, regarding\nthe nth transmit and \u03c1th receive antenna. MRC technique\nallows to combine the energy components of each transmitted\nsymbol sent over different transmit antennas and received over\nvarious receive antennas. At the receiver side, Nt MHP shapers\nare used to generate M \u00d7 Nt waveforms, according to the\npossible pulse order n and the possible location m\n\u03c9n(t, i, l,m) =\n\u221a\n1\nNtNf\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c5n(t\u2212 ([b +m]Nf + k)Tw).\n(24)\nThen, we form the vector \u2126n(t, i,m) by stacking\n\u03c9n(t, i, l,m) as follow\n\u2126n(t, i,m) = [\u03c9n(t, i, 0,m), . . . , \u03c9n(t, i, Nt \u2212 1,m)] .\n(25)\nIn order to implement the effects of block coding, h\u02dc\u03c1,n(t) is\nre-expressed function of n and l such as\nh\u02dc\u03c1,n,l(t) = h\u02dc\u03c1,([l+n] mod Nt)(t). (26)\nNext, we form a channel impulse response vector H\u02dc\u03c1,n(t) by\nstacking h\u02dc\u03c1,n,l(t) as follows\nH\u02dc\u03c1,n(t) =\n[\nh\u02dc\u03c1,n,0(t), . . . , h\u02dc\u03c1,n,l(t), . . . , h\u02dc\u03c1,n,Nt\u22121(t)\n]\n,\n(27)\nwhere H\u02dc\u03c1,n+1(t) can be obtained from H\u02dc\u03c1,n(t) via a\nleft circular permutation of its elements. Finally, with (25)\nand (27), an estimated template waveform sCR \u03c1,n(t, i,m) is\ngenerated as follows\nsCR \u03c1,n(t, i,m) = \u2126n(t, i,m). \u2217 H\u02dc\u03c1,n(t)\nT\n= X\u02dc\nNt\u22121\u2211\nl=0\nFg\u22121\u2211\nf=0\n\u03b1\u02dc\u03c1,([l+n] mod Nt),f\n\u00d7\u03c9n(t\u2212 \u03c4\u02dc\u03c1,([l+n] mod Nt),f , i, l,m)\n, (28)\nwhere .\u2217 stands for the summation of the element-wise\nconvolution of vectors \u2126n(t, i,m) and H\u02dc\u03c1,n(t)\nT\n. Our\nSTBC-IR scheme allows to transmit Nt different sym-\nbols inside a NtTs + \u03c4\u02dcmax duration, where \u03c4\u02dcmax =\nmax\n(\n\u03c4\u02dc\u03c1,([l+n] mod Nt),f\n)\n. So if each signal sCR \u03c1,n(t, i,m) is\ncorrelated independently with each received signal r\u03c1(t, i),\nover NtTs+ \u03c4\u02dcmax, each symbol is demodulated independently,\ni.e.\n\u039b(j,m) =\nN\u03c1\u22121\u2211\n\u03c1=0\n\u222b (m+1+((i+1)Nt\u22121)M)NfTw+\u03c4\u02dcmax\n(m+iMNt)NfTw\nr\u03c1(t, i)\n\u00d7sCR\u03c1,n(t, i,m)dt\n,\n(29)\n6where j = iNt + n is the transmitted symbol index of\nthe genuine \u2018symbol stream\u2019. Considering the assumption in\nSection II-B1, i.e. all the multipath are resolvable, in the\nabsence of noise the expression of \u039b(j,m) is given by\n\u039b(j,m) =\nX2\n\u221a\n\u03b5s\nNt\n\u03b4(I(j)\u2212m)\nN\u03c1\u22121\u2211\n\u03c1=0\nNt\u22121\u2211\nv=0\nFg\u22121\u2211\nf=0\n\u03b12\u03c1,v,f , (30)\nwith the variance of the aggregate noise per symbol is such\nas \u03c32s =\nX2N0\n2Nt\n\u2211N\u03c1\u22121\n\u03c1=0\n\u2211Nt\u22121\nv=0\n\u2211Fg\u22121\nf=0 \u03b1\n2\n\u03c1,v,f . The decision is\nperformed using the ML method, where:\nI(j) = argmax\nm\n[\u039b(j,m)]. (31)\nThe symbol-error probability under the present assumption is\nupper bounded by\nPM\n(\nI(j)\u2192 I(j)|\u03b1\u03c1,v,f\n)\n< M\nN\u03c1\u22121\u220f\n\u03c1=0\nNt\u22121\u220f\nv=0\nFg\u22121\u220f\nf=0\nexp\n(\u2212X2\u000fs\u03b12\u03c1,v,f\/2N0Nt). (32)\nAveraging with respect to \u03b1\u03c1,v,f , we obtain an upper bound\non the average bit-error probability as follows\nPb\n(\nI(j)\u2192 I(j)) < C (\u0393(1 +K)\u221a\npi\n\u00d7\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed X2\u03b5s\n2N0Nt\n\uf8ee\uf8f0N\u03c1\u22121\u220f\n\u03c1=0\nNt\u22121\u220f\nv=0\nFg\u22121\u220f\nf=0\ne2E\u03b1\u03c1,v,f\n\uf8f9\uf8fb\n1\nN\u03c1NtFg\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\u2212K\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nN\u03c1NtFg\n,\n(33)\nwhere C and K are defined in (16). Thus, a diversity\nadvantage of NpNtKFg and a coding advantage of\nX2\n2 N\n\u22121\nt\n(\n\u0393(1+K)\u221a\npi\n)\u2212 1\nK\n[\u220fN\u03c1\u22121\n\u03c1=0\n\u220fNt\u22121\nv=0\n\u220fFg\u22121\nf=0 e\n2E\u03b1\u03c1,v,f\n] 1\nN\u03c1NtFg\nare achieved. In Comparison with results obtained in (16)\nfor a SL-IR scheme, given the same data rate, the diversity\nadvantage is clearly increased by a factor NpNt and the coding\nadvantage is decreased by a factor Nt and multiplied by[\u220fN\u03c1\u22121\n\u03c1=0\n\u220fNt\u22121\nv=0\n\u220fFg\u22121\nf=0 e\n2E\u03b1\u03c1,v,f\n] 1\nN\u03c1NtFg\n\/\n[\u220fFg\u22121\nf=0 e\n2E\u03b1f\n] 1\nFg\n.\nNext, if we consider NCR, N\u03c1N2t template waveforms have\nto be sent prior to each frame transmission.

The same kind of behaviour\ntowards the SL-IR scheme is found in terms of decreasing\nof the coding advantage, and increasing of the diversity\nadvantage by the amount previously stated above for (33).\nSo far, from the theoretical analysis conducted, (33) and (34)\ndemonstrate that our STBC-IR scheme can achieve transmit\nand receive diversity. Therefore, depending on the mean value\nand standard deviation of each multipath component, our\nSTBC-IR scheme might achieve better performances than a\nSL-IR scheme.\nIV. SIMULATION PARAMETERS AND RESULTS\nIn this last section, according to simulation parameters, real\nperformances of the STBC-IR scheme over the IEEE channel\nmodel are assessed.\nA. Simulation Parameters\nPreviously introduced in Section II-B, the IEEE UWB chan-\nnel model has been implemented in this work. Four different\nscenarios compose this model [11]. Each scenario, CM1 to\nCM4 is defined accordingly to different channel configurations\nand characteristics. The CM1 scenario is related to very short\ndistances (0 to 4m) and line-of-sight transmissions. The CM2\nscenario is defined for the same distances, but with non-\nline-of-sight (NLOS) antenna configurations. CM3 and CM4\nscenarios are defined for NLOS antenna configurations and\ngreater transmission distances, respectively 4 to 10m, and over\n10m. Moreover, the IEEE UWB channel model assumes a\nchannel impulse response constant over 200 \u00b5s [11], and each\nof these realisations is statistically independent.\nFor CR, analysis undertaken in [13] points out the FS-\nrake receiver as a good compromise between performance\nand complexity. It provides acceptable performance, close to\nML one, for much lower complexity. The FS-rake reception\ntechnique requires to sample the received signal, after the\nmatch filtering process, at least as fast as the Nyquist rate,\nwhich involves a sampling rate of several gigahertz. Other\nassumptions and parameters are as follows:\n\u2022 The channel estimation (CR case) and synchronization is\nassumed to be perfect at the receiver side.\n\u2022 Transmitters and receivers are assumed to be sufficiently\napart from each other, thus each link of the channel is\nconsidered to be spatially and mutually uncorrelated with\nthe others.\n\u2022 A 4-OPPM is simulated, with a repetition gain of 10 dB,\nand a duty cycle of 6 dB.\n\u2022 Pulse setting: concerning SL-IR scheme simulations, the\nnormalised to unit-energy second derivative of the Gaus-\nsian pulse is considered, where\nw(t) =\n\u221a\n8\n3T0\n(\n1\u2212 4pi\n(\nt\u2212 T1\nT0\n)2)\ne\n\u22122pi\n(\nt\u2212T1\nT0\n)\n2\n.\nAs regards for the simulations of the STBC-IR scheme,\nMHPs of order n \u2208 {1, 4} are considered. The pulse\nwidth of every pulse is set to 0.7 ns, T0 is set to 0.2877\nns, and the pulse center T1 is set to 0.35 ns.\n\u2022 The BER is computed using 400 bits packets, with at least\n100 channel realisations of each channel, and 100000 bits\ntransmitted or at least 100 erroneous bits are detected,\nfor each SNR value.

Results\nIn Fig. 4, BER against SNR performances of the SL-\nIR scheme and STBC-IR scheme, for both NCR and 10-\nfingers FS-rake CR, are depicted. Here, we consider the\nCM1 channel scenario and one receive antenna. Moreover,\nthe theoretical bounds derived respectively in equations (16),\n(18), (33) and (34) are plotted in dotted lines. For NCR,\nthe SL-IR scheme performs slightly better than our STBC-\nIR scheme. This observation is also confirmed by the curves\nof the theoretical bounds. It means that even if our scheme\ncapture twice the diversity compared to the SL-IR scheme,\nthis diversity advantage remains insufficient compared to the\n3 dB loss, i.e., 10 log10(Nt), and the effects of IPI. Whereas,\nwhen applying CR, our STBC-IR scheme performs about 2\ndB better than the SL-IR scheme, at a BER of 10\u22123, and the\nbounds confirm that behaviour for higher SNR. Thus, if the\nbounds do not account for the IPI, they still provide trend of\nthe performance behaviours at high SNR. Moreover, because\nthe simulation results are averaged over the best 90 out of\n100 channel realisations, it is not possible to fairly compare\nthe bounds with the simulation results. Furthermore, as we\npredicted, NCR provides a better diversity advantage than CR\nat high SNR. Meanwhile, one can remark that over that kind\nof channel model, the diversity advantage is less perceptible\nthan over a narrow band indoor channel [9].\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28\nSNR, dB\nChannel Scenario CM1\nTheoretical bound\nSL\nSTBC, N  = 2 t\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-410\n10\n10\n10\n10\nB\nE\nR\n-510\nF = 5g\nF = 10g\nF = 20g\nFig. 5.

However,\nthe theoretical bounds, which are not taking into account the\neffects of IPI , tell another story. Thus, for a small number\nof fingers, the diversity gathered by our STBC-IR scheme is\nnot sufficient enough to counter the effects of IPI. Then, when\nFg increases, the effects of IPI decreases and our scheme, as\npredicted, gives enhanced performances. Next, Fig. 6 shows\nthe effects of the number of FS-rake fingers Fg on the SNR\nfor a fixed BER value of 10\u22123.

It reveals that for\nsmall values of Fg , Fg < 8, our scheme is outperformed by\nthe SL-IR. For Fg = 10, our scheme produces the maximum\npossible gain compared to SL-IR, i.e., 2 dB. Between Fg = 10\nand Fg = 15, the difference of performances decrease, the SL\nscheme might be less affected by the IPI than our scheme.\nThen, for Fg values above 15, the SNR starts to decrease\nlinearly with the number of rake fingers, respectively, 0.18\ndB\/fingers for our scheme and 0.23 dB\/fingers for the SL\nscheme, which implies a lesser impact of ISI and IPI on\nthe performances. Also, one can remark that a 14-fingers\nSTBC-IR scheme performs as good as a 20-fingers SL-IR\nscheme. Therefore, our scheme allows the rake complexity\nto be reduced.\nIn Fig. 7, we assess the effects of the number of transmit\nand receive antennas on the BER against SNR performances\nregarding the STBC-IR scheme. Here, we consider the CM1\nchannel scenario, a 10-fingers FS-rake CR and one receive\nantenna. Surprisingly, increasing the number of transmit an-\ntennas decreases the system performances. Thus, the additional\ndiversity provided by the transmit antenna remains insufficient\nto overcome the 10 log10(Nt) dB loss which was introduced to\ninsure an equivalent total transmitted power for each scheme.\nMoreover, adding several channel responses with different\ntime characteristics increases the IPI and partially destroys\nthe orthogonality between pulses. Therefore, our results con-\ncerning transmit diversity are dramatically different from those\nobtained in [9] over a narrow band indoor channel. However,\nfor the receive diversity, the results are quite similar. Therefore,\nthey seem quite flattering compared to the ones obtained for\nthe transmit diversity.\nIn Fig. 8, the BER against SNR. performances of both\nschemes are assessed for each channel scenario (CM1 to\nCM4). Here, we consider a 10-fingers selective FS-rake CR\nand one receive antenna.

Effects of the timing jitter on BER against SNR performances, for\nSL-IR and STBC-IR schemes, both NCR and CR (Fg = 20), CM1 channel\nscenario and one receive antenna.\nthe performance differences are quite remarkable. Our STBC-\nIR scheme outperformed the SL-IR scheme in every case,\nand particularly over CM2 and CM4, where the gain at a\nBER of 10\u22125 is about 2 dB. It is also interesting to note\nthan our scheme performed over CM2 as good as the SL-IR\nover CM1, therefore our scheme could be used to increase the\ntransmission distance.\nFinally, in Fig. 9, the main interest of a multiple antenna\nSTBC-IR scheme over that kind of channel model is revealed.\nThe BER against SNR performances of STBC-IR and SL-IR\nschemes are presented, for both NCR and 20-fingers FS-rake\nCR in presence of timing jitter effects and considering one\nreceive antenna. As our results tend to prove, the timing jitter\neffects have catastrophic consequences on the performances\n9of the SL-IR scheme. A performance threshold is reached at\nhigh SNR. Alternatively, the spatial diversity provided by our\nscheme allows us to challenge these effects and to keep accept-\nable performances at high SNR. The same conclusions were\ndrawn in [9] over a narrow band indoor channel. Therefore,\nspatial diversity seems to be a suitable way to deal with the\ntiming jitter effects.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we presented and implemented a STBC-IR\nscheme based on orthogonal pulses for multi-antenna UWB\ncommunication systems. Its performances have been assessed\nover the IEEE UWB channel model [11], applying FS-rake CR\nor NCR technique. Simplified theoretical bounds have been de-\nrived, which seems to describe relatively well the performance\ntrends at high SNR, under certain scenarios. Also, proofs\nhave been given that our STBC-IR scheme can provide both\nspatial and multipath diversities. The STBC-IR scheme may\nbe used to increase the transmission distance or to reduce the\ncomplexity of a rake receiver, keeping similar performances\ncompared to those of the SL-IR scheme. Enhancements seem\nto be greater for NLOS antenna configurations and very short\ndistances (0-4 m). Regardless of the number of transmit anten-\nnas, the STBC-IR scheme allows to keep the same data rate. It\ncan be implemented regardless of the type of modulation, and\nclass of orthogonal pulses. This work shows the advantage of\nthe receive diversity compared to the transmit diversity over\nthe IEEE UWB channel model. Overall, it also relativises the\nresults found in [9], where the advantages of STBC schemes\nagainst SL schemes were obvious over a narrow band indoor\nchannel. Here, the results are less flattering. Nevertheless,\nSTBC schemes remain a strong alternative to combat the\ndestructive effects of timing jitter in UWB communications.\nIn the future, it will be interesting to investigate the effects\nof synchronization, antenna coupling, and to test the scheme\nperformances applying realistic estimation techniques reported\nin [13].\nAPPENDIX A\nSuppose a random variable Z representing the channel gain\nfollows a log-normal (mz , \u03c3z) probability distribution such as\np(Z) =\n1\nZ\u03c3z\n\u221a\n2pi\nexp\n(\n\u22121\n2\n(\nln(Z)\u2212mz\n\u03c3z\n)2)\n.\nThe union bound on the probability of error for any M -ary\northogonal signal constellation passing through the channel is\nexpressed as\nPM (e) < MQ\n(\u221a\nSZ2\n)\n< M exp\n(\u2212SZ2\/2),\nwhere the previous inequality is based on Chernoff bound, and\nS = \u000fs\/N0 is the SNR.
