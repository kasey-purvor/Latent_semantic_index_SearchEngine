We have identified a particular repeat type\n(CTAGGG) that is associated with an extraordinarily\nhigh mutation rate (20% per gamete) in the male\ngermline. The mutation rate is affected by the\nlength and sequence homogeneity of the (CTAGG\nG)n array. This level of instability was not seen with\nother sequence-variant repeats, including the TCAG\nGG repeat type that has the same composition.\nTelomeres carrying a (CTAGGG)n array are also\nhighly unstable in somatic cells with the mutation\nprocess resulting in small gains or losses of repeats\nthat also occasionally result in the deletion of the\nwhole (CTAGGG)n array. These sequences are\nprone to quadruplex formation in vitro but adopt a\ndifferent topology from (TTAGGG)n (see accom-\npanying article). Interestingly, short (CTAGGG)2 oli-\ngonucleotides induce a DNA damage response\n(cH2AX foci) as efficiently as (TTAGGG)2 oligos in\nnormal fibroblast cells, suggesting they recruit\nPOT1 from the telomere. Moreover, in vitro assays\nshow that (CTAGGG)n repeats bind POT1 more effi-\nciently than (TTAGGG)n or (TCAGGG)n. We estimate\nthat 7% of human telomeres contain (CTAGGG)n\nrepeats and when present, they create additional\nproblems that probably arise during telomere\nreplication.\nINTRODUCTION\nAll vertebrate telomere repeat arrays are composed of\ntandem arrays of TTAGGG repeats and when active,\nthe enzyme telomerase can add novel repeats onto the\nterminus of each telomere so maintaining its length.\nWhile the regulation of telomere length and control of\ntelomerase activity is being studied extensively, the main-\ntenance and turnover of repeats located more internally in\nthe arrays are rarely considered. Telomeric DNA\nsequences are tandem repeat arrays that share some prop-\nerties with other microsatellite or simple tandem repeat\n(STRs) sequences (e.g. di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-nucleotide\nrepeat arrays) within the human genome. STRs are dis-\ntributed throughout the human genome and some show\nlength variation between unrelated individuals and conse-\nquently they have formed the basis of comprehensive gen-\netic maps of the genome (1,2). The germline mutation\ndynamics of STRs (not associated with human disease)\nhave been studied and, although the average mutation\nrate for such loci is \u00022\u0003 10\u00043 per meiosis, the mutation\nrates vary between loci (3\u20135). Factors that are known to\naffect mutation rates are the length and sequence homo-\ngeneity of the array (4). However, there is a complex rela-\ntionship between the frequency and size of mutations\nresulting in gains or losses of repeats that varies between\nrepeat types (6). The mutation mechanism underlying such\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The mutation dynamics of these TNRs is\nparticularly interesting because once the array is above a\ncertain threshold length (that differs between loci) it\nbecomes highly unstable in the male or female germline\nand usually with a bias towards large expansions (7,8).\nThis expansion bias underlies the phenomenon known as\nanticipation within families. Interestingly, some of these\ndisease-associated TNRs also show somatic instability in\nsome but not all tissues, including mitotically inert tissues\nsuch as parts of the brain. It is therefore likely that the\nunderlying mutation mechanism is dependent on replica-\ntion and other factors such as the activity of different\nDNA repair pathways (e.g. mismatch repair) that have\nbeen implicated in the instability of some disease asso-\nciated TNRs (8\u201311).\nIn humans, the majority of telomeres contain sequence-\nvariant repeats interspersed with the consensus TTAGGG\nrepeat at the proximal end of the array (12\u201315). It is\nassumed that these sequence-variant repeats arise random-\nly within the telomere repeat array but persist at the prox-\nimal end of the telomere repeat array because these\nregions are rarely influenced by telomerase in the germ-\nline. It is unknown how these sequence-variant repeats\naffect telomere function though many retain the G3\nmotif. However, it is thought that the presence of a\nlarge number of sequence variant repeats at the start of\nthe telomere is likely to reduce the contribution these\nregions make to some aspects of telomere function. By\nusing allele specific primers in the telomere-adjacent\nDNA to map the interspersion of TTAGGG and sequence\nvariant repeats (by Telomere Variant Repeat mapping by\nPCR, TVR-PCR,) it is possible to compare telomeres\n(alleles) between individuals (13). This has shown that\ntelomere repeat arrays are highly variable with a high mu-\ntation rate and that the underlying mutation mechanism is\ndominated by intra-allelic events in the normal germline.\nFurthermore, telomere repeat arrays are often mutated in\ncolon carcinomas compared with the surrounding normal\ncolon tissue and as this instability is even higher in colon\ncancers that are known to be defective in DNA mismatch\nrepair (MMR), it suggests that MMR is required for telo-\nmere stability (16). Despite this, little is known about the\nmutation dynamics of human telomeres or the effect of\nsequence-variant telomere repeats. Here we have identified\none particular repeat-type (CTAGGG) that, when present\nas a short contiguous array within the Xp\/Yp telomere,\ncauses an extraordinarily high level of localized telomere\ninstability in vivo. We demonstrate that these repeats are\nprone to quadruplex formation in vitro and adopt a differ-\nent folding topology from the classical TTAGGG repeats.\nWe also show that (CTAGGG)2 and (TCAGGG)2 oligo-\nnucleotides induced a DNA damage response as efficiently\nas (TTAGGG)2 in normal fibroblast cells (17) and that\n(CTAGGG)n repeats bind to POT1 (18) more efficiently\nthan (TTAGGG)n or (TCAGGG)n repeats in vitro.\nFinally, we discuss how the instability of (CTAGGG)n\nrepeats may arise.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nDNA samples\nHuman DNAs derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines\ncomprising the Centre d\u2019Etude du Polymorphism\nHumain (CEPH, Paris, France) panel of DNAs from\nfamilies with Northern or Western European ancestry\nwere used for telomere mutation analysis. The Russian\nfamily DNAs, extracted from venous blood samples,\nwere kindly donated by Prof. Y.E. Dubrova (19). DNA\nsamples from normal colon and colon carcinomas\nhad been collected previously from patients with\nsporadic colorectal cancer at the Leicester Royal\nInfirmary (16).\nSNP analysis in telomere adjacent DNA\nAssays to determine the genotypes at SNPs in the telo-\nmere-adjacent DNA at Xp\/Yp and 12q were conducted\nas described previously (13,15). Telomere analysis was\nconducted on heterozygous or homozygous DNA samples\nfrom the Xp\/Yp \u000430 base, using the allele specific primers\nTS-30A or TS-30T (13) and from the 12q-197 base, using\nthe allele-specific primers 12q-197A or 12q-197G (15).\nIdentification of the CTAGGG repeats\nTo identify the sequence of the repeats associated with\ngermline instability in the CEPH family 1362, TVR-PCR\nwas conducted at the Xp\/Yp telomere. Radioactively\nlabelled TVR-PCR fragments were excised from dried\npolyacrylamide gels using a scalpel. The polyacrylamide\ngel slices were rehydrated and DNA eluted in 30 ml elution\nbuffer (0.5M ammonium acetate, 10mM magnesium acet-\nate tetrahydrate, 1mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS) at\n378C for 5 h. The eluate was centrifuged, transferred to a\nfresh tube and ethanol precipitated. The precipitated\nDNA was dissolved in 10 ml TE (10mM Tris, 1mM\nEDTA) and 2 ml taken for reamplification in 40 ml PCR\nreaction using a primer nested in the telomere-adjacent\nDNA and the TAG primer. The reamplified product\nwas further purified by electroelution from an agarose\ngel or by excising the DNA band from the agarose gel\nand using QIAquickTM gel extraction kits (Qiagen).\nOnce an amplicon of a single length was obtained, it\nwas sequenced from the TAG primer using the ABI Big\nDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction\nKit. The unknown repeats in 1362 family members were\nidentified as CTAGGG repeats and primers (TAG-\nTelCTA and TAG-TelCTA2, below) designed to amplify\nthem specifically.\nTelomere variant repeat mapping by PCR (TVR-PCR)\nThe distribution of TTAGGG and sequence variant\nrepeats at the start of Xp\/Yp or 12q telomeres was\ndetermined using allele specific primers (TS-30A\/T or\n12q-197A\/G) in conjunction with one of the following\nTVR-PCR primers: TAG-TelW, TAG-TelX, TAG-TelY\n6226 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 18\n at Leicester University Library on Septem\nber 14, 2010\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nand TAG-TelJ that detect the TTAGGG, TGAGGG, TC\nAGGG or TTGGGG repeats types, respectively (13,14).\nIn addition the primer TAG-TelCTA2 50-TCATGCGT\nCCATGGTCCGGACCCTTACCCTTRCCCTARCCCT\nAG -30 (and occasionally primer TAG-TelCTA 50-TCAT\nGCGTCCATGGTCCGGACCCTTACCCTTACCCTN\nACCCTAG-30 that preferentially detects CTAGGG\nrepeats located next to TTAGGG repeats) was used in\nTVR-PCR to detect CTAGGG repeat types within the\ntelomere repeat array. Resolution of the TVR-PCR ampli-\nfied products on acrylamide gels was described previously\nwith detection of the 32P labelled products using a phos-\nphorimager (Typhoon 9400, G.E. Healthcare).\nDetection and analysis of the polymorphic 16p\/16q\ntelomere\nTo determine the presence or absence of the polymorphic\ntelomere on chromosome 16, genomic DNA was amplified\nwith the primers Nitu14eA and TelC using 968C for 20 s,\n688C for 30 s and 688C for 5min for 20 cycles. The ampli-\nfied products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels, blotted\nonto a nylon membrane and hybridized in phosphate-SDS\nsolution to a radioactively labelled probe from the telo-\nmere-adjacent DNA sequence. TVR-PCR at the poly-\nmorphic 16p\/16q telomere was carried out using the\ntelomere-adjacent primer Nitu14eD in conjunction with\nthe TVR-PCR primers described above (14).\nSingle-molecule STELA\nTo determine the somatic mutation frequency in DNA\nextracted from normal colon and colon carcinomas sam-\nples the single telomere length analysis (STELA) method\nwas used to amplify full length telomeres from very small\naliquots of DNA such that each reaction contained only a\nsingle STELA product derived from one telomere mol-\necule (single molecule-STELA or sm-STELA) at either\nthe Xp\/Yp or 12q telomere. Subsequently the intersper-\nsion of TTAGGG and sequence-variant repeats was\ndetermined for approximately 100 different sm-STELA\nproducts by TVR-PCR and the somatic mutation\nfrequency determined (20).\nCircular dichroism measurements\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a\nJASCO-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1 cm path length\nquartz cuvette in a reaction volume of 580 ml, as previously\ndescribed (21). Oligonucleotides were prepared as a 4 mM\nsolution in 10mM lithium cacodylate pH 7.2, 100mM\nNaCl or KCl buffer and annealed by heating to 908C for\n2min, followed by slow cooling to 208C.\nUV melting assays for G-quadruplexes\nThe following oligonucleotides were used for UV\nmelting analysis: CTA-22mer: AGGGCTAGGGCTAGG\nGCTAGGG, TCA-22mer: AGGGTCAGGGTCAGGGT\nCAGGG and TTA-22mer: AGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGT\nTAGGG. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by\nEurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) at the 40 or 200 nmol scale\nand used without further purification. Concentrations were\nestimated using extinction coefficients provided by the\nmanufacturer. Melting assays were performed on a\nUvikon 840 spectrophotometer in a 10mM lithium caco-\ndylate pH 7.2 buffer (supplemented with either 0.1M KCl\nor NaCl, hereafter referred to as potassium and sodium\nconditions, respectively), as previously described (22).\nQuadruplex formation may be evidenced by an inverted\ntransition at 295 nm (23,24). Melting experiments were typ-\nically performed at a concentration of 4 mM per strand. All\ntransitions were reversible, as shown by superimposable\nheating and cooling profiles at a fixed rate of 0.28C\/min.\nExposure of MRC5 cells to single-stranded\noligonucleotides\nThe MRC5 human lung fibroblast cell line was obtained\nfrom ATCC and was grown in MEM supplemented with\n10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM L-glutamine and non-essen-\ntial amino acids. MRC5 cells at PD 25 were seeded at 105\ncells\/ml (200ml per well) in 8-well culture slide chambers\n(BD Biosciences) and treated for 48 h with 40 mM\nof the indicated 12-mer oligonucleotides: TTAGGG (50-T\nTAGGGTTAGGG-30), CTAGGG (50-CTAGGGCTAG\nGG-30), TCAGGG (50-TCAGGGTCAGGG-30), CCCT\nAA (50-CCCTAACCCTAA-30), CCCTAG (50-CCCTAG\nCCCTAG-30), CCCTGA (50-CCCTGACCCTGA-30) and\nrandom (50-NNNNNNNNNNNN-30).\nDetection of cH2AX by immunofluorescence\nAfter oligonucleotide treatment, the MRC5 cells were\nwashed with 1X PBS (pH 7.2), fixed with 4% paraformal-\ndehyde, and permeabilized with 20mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH\n8.0), 50mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 300mM sucrose and\n0.5% v\/v Triton X-100 for 15min at room temperature.\nCells were then washed twice with PBS (pH 7.2). Cells\nwere blocked with 10% goat serum in 1\u0003 PBS for 1 h\nand incubated with anti-phosphorylated g-H2AX anti-\nbody (mouse, Upstate Biotechnology) at 1\/2000 in block-\ning buffer for 1 h at 378C. After washing with 1\u0003 PBS,\ncells were incubated for 30min with Alexa fluor 568 goat\nanti-mouse IgG (Molecular probes) at 1\/3000 in blocking\nbuffer, then washed with 1\u0003 PBS. The nuclear DNA was\nstained with 0.1 mg\/mL DAPI in PBS (pH 7.2) for 4min.\nCells were mounted in Shandon Immu-Mount medium\n(Thermo Scientific). Samples were observed with a DMR\nLeica microscope and images were captured with a Cool\nSnap HQ camera (Roper Scientific) controlled by\nMetamorph software (Roper Scientific). For the quantifi-\ncation of the DNA damage signal, >200 nuclei were ana-\nlysed and results represent the mean\u0005SD of four\nindependent experiments, except as indicated.\nTRF2 and POT1 binding assays\nPurified recombinant hPOT1 and TRF2 prepared from\nbaculovirus expression were a generous gift from\nDr D.

An electrophoretic mobil-\nity shift assay using hPOT1 was performed on the consen-\nsus TTA-22mer telomeric sequence (50-AGGGTTAGGGT\nTAGGGTTAGGG-30), on the CTA-22mer variant-repeat\nsequence (50-AGGGCTAGGGCTAGGGCTAGGG-30)\nNucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 18 6227\n at Leicester University Library on Septem\nber 14, 2010\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nor on the TCA-22mer variant-repeat sequence (50-AG\nGGTCAGGGTCAGGGTCAGGG-30). Oligonucleotides\nwere labelled at the 50 end with [g-32P]-ATP using T4\nPolynucleotide Kinase (New England BioLabs\u0003). The\nmobility shift assay was performed in 10 ml of the follow-\ning solution: 50mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100mM NaCl,\n0.1mM EDTA, 4% w\/v sucrose, 2% v\/v glycerol,\n0.1mg\/ml BSA, 0.02% w\/v bromophenol blue, 20 nM\nlabelled oligonucleotides and different concentrations of\nhPOT1 (6, 20, 40 and 60 nM). The reaction mixture was\nincubated at room temperature for 30min. Each individ-\nual mixture was separated immediately by electrophoresis\non 1% agarose gels in 0.5\u0003 Tris\u2013Borate\u2013EDTA buffer.\nThe gels were run at 80V for 45min, dried on Whatman\nDE81 paper and visualized by a phosporimager (Typhoon\n9210, Amersham). Analysis of the data was carried out by\nImageQuant software (Amersham) and results were\nexpressed as the fraction of DNA bound to hPOT1.\nValues corresponded to the mean value of three independ-\nent experiments \u0005 SD.\nFor TRF2 assays, the G-strand consensus telomeric\n(50-ACATGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAG-30) or\nCTAGGG variant-repeat (50-ACATGCTAGGGCTAG\nGGCTAGGGCTAG-30) or TCAGGG variant-repeat\n(50-ACATGTCAGGGTCAGGGTCAGGGTCAG-30)\nand their respective complemetary C-strands were used\nto form a double-stranded oligonucleotide. G-strands\nwere labelled at the 50 end with [g-32P]-ATP using T4\nPolynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs\u0003). Labelled\nG-strand and unlabelled C-strand, 20 nM of each were\nassembled in 50mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100mM NaCl,\n0.1mM EDTA, 4% w\/v sucrose, 2% v\/v glycerol,\n0.1mg\/ml BSA, 0.02% w\/v bromophenol blue, heated at\n508C for 10min and cooled at room temperature for\n15min. Different concentrations of TRF2 (30, 60, 100\nand 200 nM) were added to the double-stranded substrate\nand further incubated for 30min at room temperature.\nGel electrophoresis and analysis was performed as for\nhPOT1 and corresponded to the mean\u0005SEM of two\nindependent experiments.\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of the Xp\/Yp telomere repeat arrays in the\nCEPH family panel identified two families that showed\nclustering of germline mutations within the proximal por-\ntion of the telomeres containing an interspersion of TTAG\nGG and sequence-variant repeats. Sequence analysis of\nthe progenitor telomeres revealed that they both contain\n(CTAGGG)n repeat sequences. The effect of individual\nsequence-variant telomere repeats on human telomere\nrepeat arrays has not been characterized in detail and\ntherefore we have sought to determine whether the pres-\nence of CTAGGG repeats within the array affects telo-\nmere stability in vivo.\nPrevalence of CTAGGG repeats within human telomeres\nand distribution within alleles\nIn order to detect CTAGGG repeats within individual\ntelomere repeat arrays, two PCR primers were designed\nto identify all CTAGGG repeats and to identify CTAG\nGG repeats adjacent to TTAGGG repeat types (TAG-\nTelCTA2 and TAG-TelCTA, respectively). The Xp\/Yp\ntelomeres were screened for the presence of CTAGGG\nrepeats in a population of northern and western\nEuropean descent (CEPH parental DNAs) and in a popu-\nlation from Russia (19) (Figure 1). Among the 1068 telo-\nmeres screened 6.6% contained five or more CTAGGG\nrepeats (17\/160 or 10.6% in CEPH panel; 53\/908 or 6% in\nRussian population).\nWe have shown previously that there is a high density\nof SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium adjacent to the\nXp\/Yp telomere. Analysis of four SNPs (located 30, 176,\n427 and 540-bp from the start of the Xp\/Yp telomere\nrepeat array) can be used to determine the haplotype\nstatus across the SNPs thus allowing identification of indi-\nviduals that are heterozygous for the two common haplo-\ntypes (A and B) in the telomere adjacent DNA (13,15).\nHaplotype analysis was conducted in individuals that\ncontain CTAGGG-repeats within their Xp\/Yp telomeres.\nThen the interspersion pattern of TTAGGG with\nsequence-variant telomere repeats (including CTAGGG)\nwas determined for single telomere alleles by TVR-PCR.\nIn this method an allele specific primer, at the SNP 30 bp\nfrom the start of the Xp\/Yp telomere repeat array, was\nused in conjunction with a primer that anneals to the TTA\nGGG or to one of the sequence variant repeats. The\namplicons from the TVR-PCRs were size separated in a\npolyacrylamide gel so allowing the order of the repeats in\nthe ladder to be determined and converted to a telomere\ncode (Figure 2). In individuals that were homozygous for\nhaplotypes in the telomere adjacent DNA, telomere codes\nwere deduced from diploid telomere interspersion patterns\nand where possible using offspring to verify them.\nIn the majority of telomeres, the CTAGGG repeats\nwere confined to the first 1 kb of telomere sequence\nbut a few alleles e.g. haplotype A associated alleles in\nindividuals 13292.01 (Figure 1) and 1377.02 (not shown)\ncontained CTAGGG repeats further into the array but the\ndistribution could not be mapped accurately because of\nlimitations in acrylamide gel resolution. The CTAGGG\ncontaining Xp\/Yp telomeres that were mapped, were\ngrouped according to the haplotype in the telomere-adja-\ncent sequence and then subdivided by visual inspection of\nsimilarities between the alleles (Figure 1). This revealed\ngroups of related alleles that have evolved along haploid\nlineages as found previously (13,15). The number and\ndistribution of CTAGGG repeats along the telomeres\ndiffered between groups of alleles. For example. the haplo-\ntype A associated telomeres represented in 1420.01 con-\ntain a single block of 9 or 10 CTAGGG repeats adjacent\nbut distal to a block of TCAGGG repeats and most of\nthese alleles contain additional sequence-variant repeats\nfurther into the array. Most of the alleles in the haplotype\nA-associated group represented by 3183 also contain a\nsingle block of CTAGGG repeats that is more variable\nin length (8\u201319 repeats) and it may be interrupted by a\nfew N-type repeats (null repeats of unknown sequence\nthat do not amplify with any of the primers used).\nDistal to the CTAGGG block there appears to be little\nsequence variation from the consensus TTAGGG repeat.\n6228 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 18\n at Leicester University Library on Septem\nber 14, 2010\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nF\nig\nu\nre\n1\n.\nC\no\nm\np\na\nri\nso\nn\no\nf\nth\ne\nX\np\n\/Y\np\nte\nlo\nm\ner\nes\nco\nn\nta\nin\nin\ng\nC\nT\nA\nG\nG\nG\nre\np\nea\nts\n.\nT\nh\ne\nd\nis\ntr\nib\nu\nti\no\nn\np\na\ntt\ner\nn\ns\no\nf\nT\nT\nA\nG\nG\nG\n(T\n),\nT\nG\nA\nG\nG\nG\n(G\n),\nT\nC\nA\nG\nG\nG\n(C\n),\nT\nT\nG\nG\nG\nG\n(J\n)\nC\nT\nA\nG\nG\nG\n(O\n)\na\nn\nd\nn\nu\nll\n(N\n)\nre\np\nea\nts\na\nre\nsh\no\nw\nn\nfr\no\nm\nth\ne\nfi\nrs\nt\nre\np\nea\nt\nin\nth\ne\na\nrr\na\ny\n(o\nn\nth\ne\nle\nft\n).\nT\nh\nes\ne\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne\nm\na\np\ns\nw\ner\ne\no\nb\nta\nin\ned\nfr\no\nm\nin\nd\niv\nid\nu\na\nls\nin\nth\ne\nC\nE\nP\nH\nfa\nm\nil\ny\np\na\nn\nel\n(i\nd\nen\nti\nfy\nin\ng\nn\nu\nm\nb\ner\ns\nin\nb\nla\nck\n)\na\nn\nd\nfr\no\nm\na\nR\nu\nss\nia\nn\np\no\np\nu\nla\nti\no\nn\n(i\nd\nen\nti\nfy\nin\ng\nn\nu\nm\nb\ner\ns\nin\nre\nd\n).\nT\nh\ne\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne\nm\na\np\ns\na\nss\no\nci\na\nte\nd\nw\nit\nh\nh\na\np\nlo\nty\np\ne\nA\n,\nB\no\nr\nC\na\ncr\no\nss\nth\ne\nS\nN\nP\ns\nin\nth\ne\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne\na\nd\nja\nce\nn\nt\nD\nN\nA\nh\na\nv\ne\nb\nee\nn\ng\nro\nu\np\ned\nse\np\na\nra\nte\nly\na\nn\nd\nfu\nrt\nh\ner\nsu\nb\nd\niv\nid\ned\nb\ny\nsi\nm\nil\na\nri\nty\nb\net\nw\nee\nn\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne\nm\na\np\ns\no\nf\nin\nd\niv\nid\nu\na\nl\na\nll\nel\nes\n.\nIn\nd\niv\nid\nu\na\nls\nin\nw\nh\nic\nh\nth\ne\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne\nm\na\np\ns\nth\na\nt\nw\ner\ne\nd\net\ner\nm\nin\ned\nfr\no\nm\nd\nip\nlo\nid\nco\nd\nes\n(b\nec\na\nu\nse\nth\ne\nin\nd\niv\nid\nu\na\nl\nis\nh\no\nm\no\nzy\ng\no\nu\ns\na\nt\nS\nN\nP\ns\nin\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne\na\nd\nja\nce\nn\nt\nse\nq\nu\nen\nce\n)\na\nre\nsh\no\nw\nn\nin\nit\na\nli\ncs\n.\nT\nh\ne\nin\nd\niv\nid\nu\na\nls\nth\na\nt\nsh\na\nre\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne\nm\na\np\ns\nth\na\nt\na\nre\nid\nen\nti\nca\nl\nb\ny\nd\nes\nce\nn\nt\n(b\nec\na\nu\nse\nth\ne\nin\nd\niv\nid\nu\na\nls\na\nre\nre\nla\nte\nd\n)\na\nre\nsh\no\nw\nn\nin\nb\no\nld\n.\nT\nh\ne\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne\nm\na\np\ns\nin\nin\nd\niv\nid\nu\na\nls\n1\n3\n2\n9\n2\n.0\n1\na\nn\nd\n1\n3\n2\n9\n3\n.0\n1\nco\nn\nta\nin\ned\nC\nT\nA\nG\nG\nG\nre\np\nea\nts\nfu\nrt\nh\ner\nin\nto\nth\ne\na\nrr\na\ny\nb\nu\nt\nit\nw\na\ns\nn\no\nt\np\no\nss\nib\nle\nto\ng\nen\ner\na\nte\na\nd\net\na\nil\ned\nm\na\np\nb\ney\no\nn\nd\nth\ne\n1\n1\n0\nth\nre\np\nea\nt\nb\nec\na\nu\nse\no\nf\np\no\no\nr\nsi\nze\nre\nso\nlu\nti\no\nn\n.\nS\no\nm\ne\no\nf\nth\ne\nC\nT\nA\nG\nG\nG\nco\nn\nta\nin\nin\ng\nte\nlo\nm\ner\nes\nw\ner\ne\ntr\na\nn\nsm\nit\nte\nd\nto\no\nff\nsp\nri\nn\ng\nw\nit\nh\nin\nfa\nm\nil\nie\ns.\nT\nh\ne\nse\nx\no\nf\nth\ne\ntr\na\nn\nsm\nit\nti\nn\ng\np\na\nre\nn\nt\nis\nsh\no\nw\nn\n(M\n,\nm\na\nle\n;\nF\n,\nfe\nm\na\nle\n)\nw\nit\nh\nth\ne\nn\nu\nm\nb\ner\no\nf\no\nff\nsp\nri\nn\ng\nth\na\nt\nin\nh\ner\nit\ned\nth\ne\nC\nT\nA\nG\nG\nG\nco\nn\nta\nin\nin\ng\na\nll\nel\ne.\nT\nh\ne\nte\nlo\nm\ner\nes\nth\na\nt\nm\nu\nta\nte\nd\nu\np\no\nn\ng\ner\nm\nli\nn\ne\ntr\na\nn\nsm\nis\nsi\no\nn\na\nre\nid\nen\nti\nfi\ned\nw\nit\nh\na\nn\na\nst\ner\nis\nk\n.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 18 6229\n at Leicester University Library on Septem\nber 14, 2010\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nF\nig\nu\nre\n1\n.\nC\no\nn\nti\nn\nu\ned\n.\n6230 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 18\n at Leicester University Library on Septem\nber 14, 2010\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n09 12 17 06 07 10 09 12 17 06 07 10 09 12 17\nCEPH Family 1362\nTTAGGG CTAGGG\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nRepeat \nnumber\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nN\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nN\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO14\n(T)\nT\nT21\nN3\nT\nFigure 2. Identification of germline telomere mutations in CEPH family 1362. TVR-PCR was used to compare telomere maps between the father\n1362.01 and the six children that inherited his Xp\/Yp CTAGGG containing telomere. Haplotype A associated allele specific telomere maps are\nshown for 1362.09 (daughter), 1362.12 (daughter), 1362.17 (son), 1362.06 (daughter), 1362.07 (daughter) and 1362.10 (daughter) who are all het-\nerozygous for different haplotypes in the telomere adjacent sequence. The daughter 1362.09 inherited a non-mutant copy of the (CTAGGG)n\ncontaining allele from her father but the other five children all show mutations in the CTAGGG or adjacent repeats.

Among the 32\ntelomeres screened across individuals from a variety of\nethnic backgrounds, six telomeres (18.8%) that contained\na small number (<5) of CTAGGG repeats were identified\n(data not shown).\nGermline mutation analysis of CTAGGG containing\nXp\/Yp telomeres\nPreviously, using TVR-PCR analysis of telomeres that\ncontain a variety of sequence variant repeats (but not\nCTAGGG repeats), we showed that the germline muta-\ntion rate in families is 0.006\/kb\/gamete [(16); unpublished\ndata]. However analysis of (CTAGGG)n containing telo-\nmeres within families in this study revealed that some\nmutated at an extraordinarily high rate upon germline\ntransmission. For example, the haplotype A-associated\nallele in CEPH father 1362.01 (Figure 1), that contains\n(CTAGGG)14 repeats in a homogenous array, was trans-\nmitted to six children and different mutations were identi-\nfied in five of them [m=0.83\/sperm (5\/6); Figures 2 and 3].\nA comparable germline mutation rate was identified upon\ntransmission of a similar telomere present in CEPH father\n1408.01 [m=0.6\/sperm (3\/5)] and pedigree analysis\nrevealed three more germline mutations (Figure 3). The\ngermline mutations identified appear to be intra-allelic\ngains and\/or losses or occasional conversions of 1 or 2\nrepeats from the CTAGGG block or adjacent repeats.\nNevertheless some (CTAGGG)n containing telomeres\nwere transmitted to multiple children without mutation\n(e.g. haplotype A-associated allele in 23.01 and haplotype\nB associated telomere 1347.02a; Figure 1).\nFrom analysis of the population and germline transmis-\nsion data (Figures 1 and 3) of (CTAGGG)n containing\ntelomeres, we have identified some factors that seem to\ninfluence the mutability of such telomeres in the germ-\nline. To date all the telomere mutations identified occurred\nupon transmission from the father indicating that (CTAG\nGG)n containing telomeres are more likely to mutate in the\nmale than the female germline. Moreover, the number and\nsequence homogeneity of the (CTAGGG)n block within\nthe telomere seem to influence stability. Such that longer\nand more homogenous (CTAGGG)n arrays are more\nunstable, as seen for other STRs (5,8). It is also possible\nthat the repeats surrounding the (CTAGGG)n block influ-\nence its stability, however, it is difficult to disentangle the\npossible effect of surrounding repeats from other factors.\nIn summary our data indicate that if a telomere contains\na homogenous (CTAGGG) array of at least 11 repeats\nflanked by TTAGGG repeats then it is likely to be highly\nunstable in the male germline as a result of intra-allelic\nevents that give rise to small gains or losses of repeats.\nInstability of (CTAGGG)n repeats in somatic tissues\nTo determine whether the presence of CTAGGG\nrepeats within a telomere causes instability in somatic\ntissues, DNA from 34 normal colon samples (16) were\nscreened by TVR-PCR to identify individuals with\nXp\/Yp telomeres that contain CTAGGG repeats. Three\ndonors that were heterozygous for SNPs adjacent to\nthe Xp\/Yp telomere, were selected for further analysis.\nTo identify rare mutant copies of the telomere in DNA\nfrom the tissue sample, we used allele specific STELA\nto amplify full length telomeres from aliquots of DNA\nthat contain a single molecule of the telomere of interest\n[SM-STELA (20)]. Individual SM-STELA products\nwere then subjected to TVR-PCR to identify mutant\ntelomeres.\nTwo telomeres that did not contain CTAGGG repeat\nblocks (12q haplotype A in sample 23 and Xp\/Yp haplo-\ntype A in sample 2) did not show any mutations but the\nCTAGGG containing Xp\/Yp telomeres in normal tissue\nfrom individuals 20 and 23 had mutation frequencies of\n2 and 5.6%, respectively (Table 1). The combined somatic\nmutation frequency for the two CTAGGG containing\ntelomeres is significantly different from the telomeres with-\nout (Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tail P=0.009). The mutation\nfrequencies of the two (CTAGGG)n containing telomeres\nis not significantly different (Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tail\nP=0.12) but may reflect the different telomere maps as\nsample 23 contains a longer homogenous array of CTAG\nGG repeats. Furthermore, the Xp\/Yp (CTAGGG)n con-\ntaining telomere in individual 23 showed a similar muta-\ntion frequency in DNA from a colon carcinoma from\nthe patient (Table 1). This tumour has been shown to\ncontain a mutation in the A10 mononucleotide tract of\nTGFbRII gene (nucleotides 709 to 718), which is asso-\nciated with microsatellite instability in 90% of colorectal\ncancers (16,25).\nIn summary, most of the somatic telomere mutations\nappear to comprise intra-allelic changes localized to the\nCTAGGG or adjacent repeats as seen in the germline\n(Figure 3a). However, mutant 5 in the normal tissues\nfrom donor 23 (Figure 3b) contains multiple changes\nthat must have arisen simultaneously and include a dele-\ntion of at least 23 repeats that results in complete loss of\nthe (CTAGGG)13 array and mutant 1 in donor 20 appears\nto comprise a large deletion. These two mutants could\nhave arisen by a variety of mechanisms.\nCTAGGG repeats can form G-quadruplex structures\nIn order to explore why the (CTAGGG)n repeats are so\nunstable compared to other repeats within the telomere,\nwe have assessed whether the CTAGGG repeats can form\nG-quadruplex structures in vitro. CD spectra using pre-\nformed G-quadruplexes on 22mer oligonucleotides of\nthe CTAGGG, TCAGGG and TTAGGG repeats\n(\u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section) indicated that all\nthree sequences form G-quadruplexes in 100mM KCl\n(Figure 4a). Interestingly, the three CD spectra are quite\ndistinct, and suggest that the CTA-22mer adopts a differ-\nent G-quadruplex conformation than the TTA-22mer or\nthe TCA-22mer (Figure 4a) (26,27). These three oligonu-\ncleotides form quadruplexes with similar stabilities with\nmelting temperatures (Tm) in the same range (CTA-22\nmer: Tm 628C in K\n+ and 548C in Na+: Figure 4b;\n6232 Nucleic

TCA-22\nmer: Tm 618C in K\n+ and 518C in Na+: not shown).\nFurthermore, the accompanying article shows that the\n(CTAGGG) repeats adopt a novel antiparallel G-quadru-\nplex structure (doi:10.1093\/nar\/gkp630; 28).\nInduction of DNA damage foci by single-stranded\n(CTAGGG)2 and (TCAGGG)2 oligonucleotides\nIt has been shown that single-stranded (TTAGGG)2 oli-\ngonucleotides induce the formation of DNA damage foci\nin MRC5 normal fibroblast cells (17) and so we have\ninvestigated whether the degenerate telomere repeats can\ninduce the same response. Figure 4c and d show, that the\nC-rich oligonucleotides do not induce the formation of\ngH2AX foci above the background level in the untreated\nMRC5 (control) cells or above that seen for a random\noligonucleotide. However, the G-rich (CTAGGG)2\nand (TCAGGG)2 oligos induced gH2AX foci formation\nwith a similar efficiency to the consensus (TTAGGG)2\noligo and significantly above the background level in\nthe control cells (P-values=0.0128, 0.0024 and 0.0198\nfor TTAGGG, CTAGGG and TCAGGG, respectively).\nCTAGGG repeats bind to TRF2 and POT1\nIt has been proposed that the formation of DNA damage\nfoci following exposure to (TTAGGG)2 oligonucleotides\noccurs because the oligos titrate factors away from telo-\nmeres. The resulting uncapped telomeres then signal DNA\ndamage (17). Therefore, we next sought to determine\nwhether telomere DNA binding proteins can also bind\nto CTAGGG and TCAGGG repeats. The in vitro\ndouble-strand DNA binding assays showed that CTAG\nGG and TCAGGG can bind to TRF2, though not as\nefficiently as the consensus TTAGGG repeat\n(Figure 5a). Similar results were obtained with TRF1\n(Supplementary Figure 1). Unexpectedly, the in vitro\nsingle-stranded binding assay showed that POT1 binds\nto CTAGGG repeats (CTA-22mer) more efficiently than\nto the consensus TTAGGG (TTA-22mer) or TCAGGG\n(TCA-22mer) repeats (Figure 5b). In contrast and as a\ncontrol, a C to A mutation in the minimal binding site\nfor POT1 (50-TAGGGATAG-30) impairs POT1 binding\n[Supplementary Figure 2; (29)]. Thus, these results com-\nbined with the induction of gH2AX foci (above) strongly\nindicate that (CTAGGG)n repeats bind to POT1.\nDISCUSSION\nThe data presented has shown that the presence of a short\narray of CTAGGG repeats within the Xp\/Yp telomere\nrepeat array can cause an extraordinarily high level of\ninstability in the male germline with a mutation rate of\n20% per gamete (10\/49 across all CTAGGG containing\nalleles transmitted via the male germline). In contrast,\nno mutations were observed when CTAGGG carrying\ntelomeres were transmitted via the female germline\n(0\/52), thus the male and female germline mutation rates\nare significantly different (Fisher\u2019s exact test, two-tailed\nP=0.0004). The male germline mutation rate varies\nwidely between the (CTAGGG)n carrying alleles with\n23\n N\nor\nma\nl \n(H\nap\nlo\nty\npe\n A\n a\nss\noc\nia\nte\nd)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

1362.01). It seems clear that the length and homogen-\neity of the CTAGGG repeat array within the telomere\ninfluence its mutability, such that longer, homogenous\narrays are more unstable, as seen for other STR arrays\n(5,8). Furthermore in the male germline, instability results\npredominantly in small gains or losses of a few repeats\nwithin or adjacent to (CTAGGG)n arrays.\nThe fact that instability was only observed when the\ntelomere carrying the CTAGGG array was transmitted\nvia the male germline suggests that the underlying mech-\nanism causing the instability is replication dependent.\nConsistent with this hypothesis, we found that CTAGG\nG carrying telomeres showed elevated instability when\ncompared to other telomeres lacking CTAGGG repeats,\nin DNA samples derived from normal colon samples\nand in a colon carcinoma derived from one of the same\nindividuals, even though the tumour showed microsat-\nellite instability, suggestive of defective DNA MMR\n(16). Interestingly, although the majority of somatic muta-\ntions were small gains or losses of repeats as seen in the\ngermline, two mutant molecules (mutant 5 in normal\ncolon 23 and mutant 1 in normal colon 20, Figure 3b)\nshowed larger changes that resulted in loss of all or the\nmajority of CTAGGG repeats present in the progenitor\ntelomere. Furthermore, the loss of the CTAGGG repeats\nin mutant 5 is accompanied by other changes.\nReplication of telomeres is problematic for several rea-\nsons. Primarily telomere replication leads to incomplete\nlagging-strand synthesis and this, accompanied by resec-\ntioning of the C-rich strand, causes telomere erosion (30).\nIn addition, the initiation of telomere replication is\nthought to occur only at an origin adjacent to the telomere\nrepeat array. The replication fork then migrates in one\ndirection through the telomere towards the terminus\n[reviewed in (31,32)]. As there is only one replication\nfork travelling through the telomeric DNA, it must be\nrestarted if it pauses or stalls during replication (33) or\nthe telomere will not be replicated fully. It has been pro-\nposed that as the replication fork approaches the t-loop, it\nmay pause or even stall until the t-loop is released (32).\nFurthermore, there is increasing evidence that, as the telo-\nmeric DNA is unwound, the G-rich strand of the replicat-\ning telomere is likely to form unusual structures that\ncan impede replication and these include G-quadruplex\nstructures. We have shown that CTAGGG repeats can\nform G-quadruplex structures in vitro that are different\nfrom those formed by the consensus telomere sequence.\nTTAGGG repeats have been shown to present an import-\nant structural polymorphism for quadruplex folding\nin vitro, and several different folds that greatly differ by\ntheir loop arrangements and anti\/syn guanine orientations\nin the quartets have already been structurally character-\nized [for a recent review see (34)]. Our results suggest a\nrather different topology for CTAGGG repeats and struc-\ntural analysis by NMR confirms an unusual folding com-\npared to TTAGGG repeats (PDB:2KM3; see doi:10.1093\/\nnar\/gkp630; 28). It is possible that this structural con-\nformation represents an additional obstacle for normal\ntelomere lagging-strand synthesis during replication.\nThe investigation of TRF1 and TRF2 binding to TTAG\nGG and sequence variant repeats in vitro suggests that CT\nAGGG and TCAGGG repeats show only a mild decrease\nin binding efficiency, in contrast to other degenerate\nrepeats (TTGGGG or TTAGGC) that abolish TRF1 or\nTRF2 binding (35,36). In contrast, the in vitro POT1 bind-\ning assay showed that CTAGGG repeats (CTA-22mer)\nhad a strikingly higher binding affinity than the TTAGG\nG or TCAGGG repeats. Previous studies have shown that\nhPOT1 has a minimal binding sequence (29,37).\nMoreover, it was shown that some bases within the TTA\nGGGTTAG binding motif are less essential for hPOT1\nbinding in vitro than others. For example, T to A substitu-\ntions in position 1 or 7 of the decamer substrate reduced\nbut did not prevent binding (37). Our study supports and\nextends these observations as we show that there is a\ngreater tolerance for substitutions at these positions and\nthat some may in fact enhance binding. Although our\ninteresting result needs to be confirmed by other methods,\nit is partially corroborated by our observation that short\nsingle-stranded oligos of the CTAGGG repeats induce the\nstrongest DNA damage response of the three G-rich\noligos (Figure 4d). Moreover, it has already been shown\nthat DNA damage response induced by TTAGGG oligos\nappears to arise through the recruitment of telomere cap-\nping proteins (such as POT1) away from telomeres as they\nenter S-phase (17).\nIf present within a telomere, the CTAGGG repeats\noccur near the start of the repeat array. Therefore,\nthey are only likely to be available for POT1 binding if\nthe telomeric single-stranded overhang inserts into this\nregion during t-loop formation or following strand\nTable 1.

Therefore the mutation frequency is the number of mutant molecules\/the number of molecules analysed.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 18 6235\n at Leicester University Library on Septem\nber 14, 2010\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nseparation during DNA replication.

In that case, POT1 binding to these repeats in\nt-loop formation or during replication would represent a\nmechanism to prevent fork stalling. When a replication\nfork is blocked, the DNA continues to unwind and bind\nto RPA until the replication checkpoint is activated and\nthe replication helicase is stopped (40). There may be com-\npetition between RPA and POT1 for binding to the single-\nstranded telomeric DNA during replication, if this results\nin reduced quadruplex removal, it would lead to fork stall-\ning and a possible slippage during replication. Whatever\nthe mechanism, restarting a replication fork that has\nstalled at a (CTAGGG)n array will likely involve DNA\nrepair that can cause localized mutation or even removal\nof the (CTAGGG)n. Finally, the possibility that the\nC-strand of the (CTAGGG)n repeats also forms an\nunusual structure is not excluded and has to be considered\nin regard to other single-stranded proteins involved in\ntelomere replication.\nIn summary, when considered together the in vivo\nmutation data, the structural analysis, the DNA damage\nresponse and protein binding assays all indicate that\nhomogenous arrays of CTAGGG repeats have unusual\nproperties. We propose that such CTAGGG arrays are\nmore likely to form abnormal structures than other\ntelomere variant repeats and that these structures either\nimpede t-loop release or telomere replication causing the\nreplication fork to stall. The subsequent processing may\ninvolve a variety of repair processes that result in small\ngains\/losses of repeats from the (CTAGGG)n array or\nmore intricate repair leading to deletion of the CTAGG\nG repeats but facilitating restarting of the telomere repli-\ncation fork. We have shown that a subset of Xp\/Yp telo-\nmeres and telomeres on chromosome 16 contain CTAGG\nG repeats. By extrapolation we predict that 7% of all\ntelomeres will contain (CTAGGG)n repeats that add\nanother layer of complexity to the telomere length dynam-\nics in the individual.\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nSupplementary Data are available at NAR Online.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank Dr Jennie Jeyapalan and Andrew\nJones for their contributions toward this work.\nD.
