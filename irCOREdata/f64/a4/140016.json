Hence, from \n2001 to 2005, the Silvoarable Agroforestry for Europe project developed a systematic process to \nevaluate the biophysical and economic performance of arable, forestry, and silvoarable systems \nin Spain, France, and the Netherlands.  A biophysical model called \u201cYield-SAFE\u201d was \ndeveloped to predict long-term yields for the different systems and local statistics and expert \nopinion were used to derive their revenue, costs, and pre- and post-2005 grant regimes.  These \ndata were then used in an economic model called \u201cFarmSAFE\u201d to predict plot- and farm-scale \nprofitability.  Land equivalent ratios were greater than one, showing Yield-SAFE predicted that \ngrowing trees and crops in silvoarable systems was more productive than growing them \nseparately.  Pre-2005 grants in Spain and the Netherlands penalised silvoarable systems, but \npost-2005 grants were more equitable.  In France, walnut and poplar silvoarable systems were \nconsistently the most profitable system under both grant regimes.  In Spain, holm oak and stone \npine silvoarable systems were the least profitable system under pre-2005 grants, but only \nmarginally less profitable than arable systems under post-2005 grants.  In the Netherlands, low \ntimber values and the opportunity cost of losing arable land for slurry manure application made \nsilvoarable and forestry systems uncompetitive with arable systems under both grant regimes.    \n 2\nIntroduction \nAgroforestry is a form of multi-cropping, involving at least one woody-perennial \nspecies, and ecological and economic interactions between the components.  \nAgroforestry systems can be described by their components (crops, animals and trees) \nand their spatial (dispersed or zoned) and temporal (coincident to sequential) \narrangement (Nair 1985, Sinclair 1999).  Silvoarable agroforestry is defined as the \npractice of growing an arable crop between spatially zoned trees (Dupraz and Newman, \n1997, Burgess et al., 2004b) \n \nMost research on agroforestry systems has evaluated their biophysical performance \ndespite the observation that it is often socio-economic constraints that limit their \nadoption (Graves et al., 2004, Mercer et al., 1998).  In practice, because of biophysical \nand socio-economic interactions (Dyack et al., 1999), there is a need to consider both of \nthese together.  However, complete empirical data for entire tree rotations are rare and \ncomputer simulations therefore provide a means of systematically undertaking \nbiophysical and economic analyses of silvoarable systems in the absence of such data. \n \nVarious biophysical and economic models have been developed for monocultures of \narable and forestry systems, but relatively few have been developed for silvoarable \nagroforestry (Graves et al., 2005).  Current bio-economic models of silvoarable \nagroforestry range from detailed biophysical models with limited economic analysis to \neconomic models that use biophysical data from an external source (Graves et al., \n2005).  Bio-economic modelling has been used to examine profitability (Thomas 1991, \nWillis et al. 1993, Thomas and Willis, 1997; Burgess et al. 2000) and feasibility \n(Dupraz et al., 1995) of silvoarable agroforestry in Europe.  Profitability is usually \nassessed at a plot- (one-hectare) scale and performance is compared with that in \ncompeting systems, such as arable and forestry systems.  Feasibility is usually \ndetermined at a farm-scale to view how silvoarable agroforestry affects cash-flow and \nresource use.  This paper describes the integrated use of a biophysical and an economic \nmodel, at both a plot- (one-hectare) and farm-scale, to determine the profitability of \nsilvoarable systems in comparison with arable and forestry sytems.  In particular, it \ndescribes the effect of grants on the profitability of silvoarable systems relative to that \nof arable and forestry systems.  The study focuses on three countries, Spain, France, and \nthe Netherlands, selected because of their differing climates, tree and crop species, and \ngrant regimes.  \n \nMethod \nIn order to determine the profitability of arable, forestry, and silvoarable systems, a \nmethod comprising five steps was used.  These included:  1) identifying and \ncharacterising potential sites for the uptake of silvoarable agroforestry, 2) defining \npotential arable, forestry and silvoarable systems for those sites, 3) using a bio-physical \nmodel to determine yields for those systems, 4) defining the revenue, costs and grant \nregimes associated with each site, and 5) using an economic model to determine the \nfinancial effects at a plot- and farm-scale.   \n \n 3\nIdentification and characterisation of landscape test sites \nSince a major objective was to determine if silvoarable agroforestry could provide a \nprofitable alternative land use in areas dominated by arable cropping, potential sites \nwere limited to areas where there was arable land, as specified by the Pan-European \nLand Cover Monitoring (PELCOM) project (M\u00fccher et al. 2000).  The sites were also \nrestricted to those areas belonging to the three dominant environmental classes in each \ncountry (or one in the case of the Netherlands), as described by M\u00fccher et al. (2003) in \na statistical analysis of climate and topography.  Within these constraints, three \nlandscape test sites, measuring 4 km x 4 km, from each environmental class, were \nrandomly selected using a geographical information systems, to give nine, nine, and \nthree landscape test sites in Spain, France and the Netherlands respectively.  Two sites \nin France were later discarded for lack of associated data, giving 19 sites altogether \n(Table 1).   \n \nTable 1.

The annual values for \n 4\nmean air temperature and total radiation were highest in Spain (9.1-15.5oC and 5480-\n6600 MJ m-2) and lowest in the Netherlands (8.8-9.0oC and 3690-4830 MJ m-2) (Table \n1).  Mean annual rainfall was lowest in Spain (320-530 mm) and highest in France \n(590-1080 mm).  In Spain, much of the rainfall occurred in winter, with minimal rainfall \nin summer.  In France, seasonality of rainfall, although greatly reduced, was still \nevident, while in the Netherlands, rainfall was generally consistent throughout the year. \n \nSoil depth and texture were defined for each landscape test site, and using a \nclassification of hydraulic properties of European soils (W\u00f6sten et al. 1999), available \nsoil water content was described using van Genuchten\u2019s equation (1980).  Further data \nlayers for elevation and land cover were developed, and the effect of topography on \nrelative radiation was calculated from digital elevation models in the Digitales Gel\u00e4nde-\nModell (DiGeM\u00a9) (Conrad, 2002).  Field visits were also made to each site to confirm \nexisting interpretation, improve existing data, and provide missing data.   \n \nTo provide a qualitative description of the arable land in each landscape test site, \nbetween one and four \u201cland units\u201d were defined, by excluding non-arable land and then \nusing a cluster analysis of available soil water content and relative solar radiation \nreceipt on the remaining area (Table 2).  In total, there were 42 land units.    \n \nDefinition of tree and crop species and management \nThe land units defined for each landscape test site were ranked according to their \nquality, and expert opinion was used to determine the most suitable tree species and \ncrop rotation for each land unit.   In Spain, the trees selected were holm oak (Quercus \nilex) and stone pine (Pinus pinea), in France, wild cherry (Prunus avium), walnut \n(Juglans spp.), and poplar (Populus spp.) and in the Netherlands, walnut and poplar.  In \nSpain, arable systems were based on wheat, sunflower, and fallow.  In France, arable \nsystems at Champdeniers, Chateauroux, Fussy, and Sancerre were based on wheat and \nsunflower and, in the Franche Comt\u00e9 region (Champlitte, Fussy and Vitrey) on wheat, \noilseed and grain maize.  In the Netherlands, wheat and forage maize were assumed for \nthe arable systems.  The silvoarable systems integrated the forestry tree species and \narable crop species and rotation for each land unit. \n \nThe management of the arable systems reflected local practice.  Management of the \nforestry systems was also based on local practice.  In Spain, planting densities, thinning \nand pruning for oak were derived from Pulido et al., (2003), and for stone pine, from \nYag\u00fce (1995) and Montero and Ca\u00f1ella (2000).  In France, management for forestry \nsystems was developed using the Institut pour le D\u00e9veloppement Forestier (1997), \nSouleres (1992), Boulet-Gercourt (1997) and the Centre R\u00e9gional de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \nForesti\u00e8re (1997).  In the Netherlands, the receipt of grants was conditional on an \nappropriate planting density (Ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit, \n2004).  It was assumed that each tree species was planted in year 1 and holm oak, stone \npine, wild cherry and walnut were \u201charvested\u201d to provide revenue in year 60.  For \npoplar, a rotation of 20 years was assumed with re-planting in years 21 and 41.  \nManagement of the silvoarable systems combined the management of the arable and \nforestry systems, or use expert judgement as appropriate.   \n \n 5\nTable 2.

A default set of parameters for \nthe \u201cpotential\u201d yield of each tree and crop species (Van Ittersum and Rabbinge, 1997) \nwas developed, assuming no water limitation on growth (Burgess et al. 2004a).  These \nparameters were then used to determine water limited \u201creference\u201d yields for the forestry \nand arable systems by adjusting three parameters (harvest index, water use efficiency \nand a management factor) within acceptable boundaries, so that predicted Yield-SAFE \nyields matched reference yields.  Local crop and tree management, and radiation, \nrainfall, temperature, and soil depth data for each landscape test site were used as inputs \nfor Yield-SAFE.  Dry wood densities assumed for timber ranged from 410 kg m-3 for \npoplar to 900 kg m-3 for oak; intermediate values of 570 to 608 kg m-3 were used for \nwalnut, stone pine, and wild cherry.  The reference yields for each crop and tree species \nwere determined from national statistics and expert opinion, during workshops in each \ncountry.       \n \nUsing the parameter set developed for reference yields and soils at each landscape test \nsite, tree and crop yields for each land unit were predicted for monoculture forestry and \narable systems and two silvoarable systems of 50 or 113 trees ha-1.  From the \nbiophysical yields, it was possible to estimate a land equivalent ratio (LER) for each \nsystem.  Land equivalent ratios were initially defined for mixed cropping systems \n(Mead and Willey, 1980) and have been adapted for agroforestry systems (Ong 1996, \nDupraz, 1998).  The land equivalent ratio is \u201cthe ratio of the area under sole cropping to \nthe area under the agroforestry system, at the same level of management that gives an \nequal amount of yield\u201d (Ong, 1996) and is expressed as:  \nyieldemonoculturCrop\nyieldesilvoarablCrop\nyieldemonoculturTree\nyieldesilvoarablTreeLER +=  Equation 1 \nWhere more than one crop occurred in the rotation, a weighted ratio for each crop was \nused, depending on its proportion in the rotation.   \n \nDefinition of revenue, costs and grants  \nFinancial data on the revenue and costs associated with arable, forestry, and silvoarable \nsystems were collected on electronic templates for each landscape test site, using local \nand national statistics, and expert opinion (Graves, 2005).   For the crop component of \nthe silvoarable system, the variable and assignable fixed costs were applied according to \nthe proportion of the arable area in the system.  It was also assumed that cropping would \nonly continue if the intercrop net margin (calculated on a five year moving average to \nremove the effect of yield variation) was profitable, after which it was assumed the \nintercrop area would be fallowed.  \n \nThe financial data for forestry and the tree component of the silvoarable system \ncomprised the revenue from timber and subsidies, and the costs of woodland \nestablishment and management.  The revenue from timber was calculated using \nrelationships between the standing value of a cubic metre of timber and the timber \nvolume for each species in each country.  The costs associated with the forestry system \nand the tree component of the silvoarable systems were based on various sources. \n 7\n \nA particular focus of this study was the effect of grants, and three regimes were \nexamined: a zero grant regime, a pre-2005 grant regime, associated with direct area \npayments, and a post-2005 grant regime associated with the single farm payment \nscheme.  The pre- and post-2005 grant regimes for arable, forestry, and silvoarable \nsystems was established from local, national, and European documents (European \nCommission, 2004), and expert opinion.  However, since the post-2005 grant regime for \nsilvoarable agroforestry was unclear, two extreme scenarios were developed.  In \nscenario 1, the single farm payment was assumed for the percentage of cropped area in \nthe system, without tree payments.  In scenario 2, the single farm payment was assumed \nfor the whole system, with a planting grant to cover 50% of the tree costs in the first \nfour years of the tree rotation. \n \nPlot-scale economic modelling \nThe predicted annual yields of trees and crops were used as inputs for a plot- and farm-\nscale cost-benefit economic model called \u201cFarmSAFE\u201d (Graves et al., 2005).   \nIn arable systems, profitability is typically compared on an annual and per unit area \nbasis by adding the revenue generated (R) to the variable costs associated with \ngenerating that revenue (V) to give a gross margin (Gross margin = VR \u2212 ) (Nix, 1999; \nMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 1983).   However because other costs such \nas labour and machinery, sometimes termed \u201cassignable fixed costs\u201d (A), are modifiable \nover a long time period, it is common practice to compare arable, forestry, and \nsilvoarable systems on the basis of their net margin (Net margin = AVR \u2212\u2212 ) (Willis et \nal. 1993; Burgess et al. 2000, Graves et al., 2005).  As the benefits and costs associated \nwith tree-based systems occur over many years, discounted cost benefit analysis was \nused to define the present value of future costs and benefits from the arable, forestry, \nand silvoarable systems, using the approach first defined by Faustmann (1849).  The net \npresent value (NPV; units: \u20ac ha-1) was expressed as: \n\u2211=\n= +\n\u2212\u2212=\nTt\nt\nt\nttt\ni\nAVR\nNPV\n0 )1(\n)(  Equation 2 \nWhere: NPV was the net present value of the arable, forestry, or silvoarable enterprise \n(\u20ac ha-1), Rt was the revenue from the enterprise (including subsidies) in year t (\u20ac ha-1), \nVt was the variable costs in year t (\u20ac ha-1), At was the assignable fixed costs in year t (\u20ac \nha-1), T was the time horizon (years), and i was the discount rate (discount rate = 4%).   \n \nIn order to compare systems with different rotation lengths, an infinite net present value \nwas calculated.  This was the net present value defined over an infinite rotation, in \nwhich each replication had a rotation of n years.  The infinite net present value (iNPV; \nunits: \u20ac ha-1) was defined as: \n1)1(\n)1(\n\u2212+\n+= n\nn\ni\niNPViNPV  Equation 3 \nThe infinite net present value was also expressed as an equivalent annual value (EAV) \nusing the following formula: \nEAV = iNPV \u00d7 i Equation 4 \n 8\nThe zero, pre- and post-2005 grant regimes were examined in terms of their effect on \nthe economic performance of the arable, forestry, and the silvoarable systems (113 trees \nha-1 only) using the equivalent annual value (discount rate = 4%).   \n \nFarm-scale modelling \nIn order to assess the feasibility of the selected silvoarable systems at a farm-scale, \nhypothetical cereal farms in each landscape test site were determined from regional \ndata.  In Spain, this was obtained from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) \n(European Commission, 2005), in the Netherlands, from the Agricultural Economics \nResearch Institute (2005), and in France, from the R\u00e9seau d\u2019observation des syst\u00e8mes \nd\u2019exploitation (ROSACE) (Assembl\u00e9e Permanente des Chambres d\u2019Agriculture, 2005).  \nWhere hypothetical cereal farms could not be determined from the available data, \nhypothetical farms were defined using the most commonly occurring farm type in the \nregion.  For each landscape test site, the area of each land unit relative to the total area \nof the land units was used to represent the proportion of each land unit within the \nhypothetical farms.   \n \nThe FarmSAFE model was used to determine the effect of up to four arable, four \nforestry, and four silvoarable systems on the financial resources of each farm.  \nEconomic feasibility at the farm-scale was determined using the infinite net present \nvalue of the farm (iNPVfarm; units: \u20ac farm-1).  This aggregated net present values of the \ndifferent systems and the net present value of \u201cfarm fixed costs\u201d (Ft: units: \u20ac farm-1) \nover the same period of time, and was defined as:   \n( )\n1)1(\n)1(\n)1(0\n4\n1 \u2212+\n+\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+\u2212++= \u2211\u2211\n=\n=\n=\n=\nn\nnTt\nt\nt\nt\nl\nl\nssffaafarm i\ni\ni\nF\naNPVaNPVaNPViNPV   Equation 5 \nWhere:  l was one of four possible land units, NPVa, NPVf, and NPVs were the net \npresent values (\u20ac ha-1) of arable, forestry and silvoarable enterprises in each unit l; \naa , fa , and, sa  were the area (ha) of arable, forestry, and silvoarable systems in each \nunit l, Ft was the farm fixed cost in year t (\u20ac farm-1), T was the time horizon (years), i \nwas the discount rate and n was the duration of the rotation (years).   \n \nThe infinite net present value of the farm was used to evaluate the economic effect of \nplanting 10% of the farm with forestry or silvoarable systems, in comparison with the \narable status quo of the hypothetical farms at each landscape test site, under the pre- and \npost-2005 grant regimes.  \n \n 9\nResults \nYields in arable and forestry systems \nIn Spain, the reference timber volumes for oak and stone pine in year 60 were assumed \nto be 0.22-0.26 m3 tree-1, indicating relatively slow growth.  In France, wild cherry \n(1.04-1.06 m3 tree-1) and walnut (1.04 m3 tree-1) yields in year 60 were relatively high, \nindicating relatively fast-growing trees.  Poplar was the fastest growing tree with \nreference yields of 1.46-1.51 m3 tree-1 in year 20.  In Spain, the reference yields for \nwheat were relatively low (1.62-3.71 t ha-1) compared to those in France (6.5-8.0 t ha-1) \nand the Netherlands (7.8 t ha-1).  Reference sunflower yields were also lower in Spain \n(0.60-1.09 t ha-1) than in France (2.3-2.5 t ha-1).  Reference yields for oilseed (3.2-4.0 t \nha-1) and grain maize (7.5-8.0 t ha-1) were assumed only for France and a reference yield \nfor fodder maize (12 t ha-1) assumed only for the Netherlands.     \n \nCrop yields developed using Yield-SAFE showed inter-annual variation around the \nreference values for each site, due to the inter-annual variation in temperature, rainfall, \nand solar radiation.  Crop yields ranged from 0.2 t ha-1 for sunflower in Spain to 15.9 t \nha-1 for maize in the Netherlands (Table 3).  Although the greatest absolute variation in \nyield was associated with high yielding crops in the Netherlands and France, the relative \nvariation in yields was greatest in Spain.   For the forestry systems, the timber volume \nper tree ranged from 0.23 m3 for holm oak after 60 years, to 1.59 m3 for poplar after 20 \nyears.  Standard deviations showed that absolute yield variation was relatively high for \nwild cherry in France and poplar in the Netherlands; coefficients of variation showed \nthat relative yield variation was relatively high for oak in Spain, wild cherry in France, \nand poplar in the Netherlands.   \n \nTable 3 Summary and description of yields for crops and trees in France, Spain and the \nNetherlands \nCountry Arable crop No of \nvalues \nMean Standard \ndeviation \nRange  Coefficient \nof variation \n   (t ha-1) (t ha-1) (t ha-1)  (%) \nSpain Sunflower 120 0.8 0.4 0.2-1.7  52 \n  Wheat 697 2.5 1.0 0.6-5.8  40 \nFrance Grain maize 61 6.3 1.2 2.9-9.8  20 \n  Oilseed 260 3.2 0.4 1.9-4.3  13 \n  Sunflower 106 1.7 0.4 0.7-2.6  26 \n  Wheat 613 5.5 1.5 0.9-10.5  27 \nNetherlands Forage maize 80 11.5 1.7 8.0-15.9  15 \n  Wheat 20 7.9 1.2 5.9-11.1  16 \n Tree species  (m3 ha-1) (m3 ha-1) (m3 ha-1)  (%) \nSpain Oak (60) 16 0.33 0.050 0.23-0.43  15 \n  Pine (60) 3 0.25 0.005 0.25-0.26  2 \nFrance Cherry (60) 12 0.88 0.151 0.71-1.15  17 \n  Poplar (60) 4 1.34 0.143 1.26-1.59  11 \n  Walnut (60) 4 1.01 0.008 1.00-1.02  1 \nNetherlands Poplar (20) 2 1.28 0.215 1.06-1.49  17 \n  Walnut (60) 1 0.71 n\/a 0.71  n\/a \nNote: values in brackets show length of rotation \n \n \n 10\nFor each crop, except wheat in Spain, there was a significant positive correlation \nbetween predicted annual crop yields and soil depth (Table 4).

Oak (Figure 1a) and stone pine (which \nshowed similar growth over time to oak and is therefore not shown) grew slowly \nthroughout the whole rotation.  Hence, relatively high crop yields were sustained for \nmost of the tree rotation.  The initial rate of timber formation by wild cherry (Figure 1b) \nwas slow compared with walnut (Figure 1c) and poplar (Figure 1d), and crop yield \nreduction in the walnut and poplar systems was predicted to occur earlier than in the \nwild cherry systems.  As expected, crop yields and tree growth (on a per tree basis) were \ngreater in 50 tree ha-1 systems than in 113 tree ha-1 systems (Figure 1). \n \n \n 11\na) Land unit 2, St Maria del Campo, Spain (oak; wheat\/wheat\/wheat\/wheat\/wheat\/fallow) \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n0 20 40 60\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \ncr\nop\n y\nie\nld\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n0 20 40 60T\nim\nbe\nr v\nol\num\ne \n(m\n3 \/t\nre\ne)\n \nb) Land unit 1, Champdeniers, France (wild cherry; wheat\/wheat\/s\/wheat\/oilseed\/sunflower) \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n0 20 40 60\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \ncr\nop\n y\nie\nld\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n0 20 40 60\nTi\nm\nbe\nr v\nol\num\ne \n(m\n3 \/t\nre\ne)\n \nc) Land unit 2, Champdeniers, France (walnut; wheat\/wheat\/s\/wheat\/oilseed\/sunflower) \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \ncr\nop\n y\nie\nld\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n0 20 40 60\nTi\nm\nbe\nr v\nol\num\ne \n(m\n3 \/t\nre\ne)\nd) Land unit 1, Sherpenzeel, the Netherlands (poplar; forage maize) \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n0 20\nTime from tree planting (a)\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \ncr\nop\n y\nie\nld\nArable 50 trees\/ha 113 trees\/ha\n \n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n0 20\nTime from tree planting (a)\nTi\nm\nbe\nr v\nol\num\ne \n(m\n3 \/t\nre\ne)\n50 trees\/ha 113 trees\/ha Forestry\n \nFigure 1  Prediction of relative crop yields and timber volumes over time for a) oak, b) \nwild cherry, c) walnut, and d) poplar silvoarable systems (50 and 113 trees ha-1) on four \ndifferent land units. \n 12\nOver the whole length of the tree rotation, crop yields relative to those in arable systems \nwere greatest in the 50 tree ha-1 systems and timber yields relative to those in forestry \nsystems were greatest in the 113 tree ha-1 systems (Figure 2).  During a full tree \nrotation, in both France and Spain, the relative yield obtained for autumn-planted wheat \ntended to be greater than that for spring-planted sunflower (Figure 3a and 3b).  \nSimilarly, under poplar in the Netherlands (Figure 3c), the relative yield obtained for \nwheat (autumn-planted) was greater than that for forage maize (spring-planted).  \nRelative timber production also varied between species.  At 113 trees ha-1 relative \ntimber production was higher for walnut, wild cherry, and poplar (63-81%) then for oak \nand stone pine (34-37%) (Figures 2a); a similar pattern between the species was evident \nat 50 trees per ha-1, but the relative yields (45-56% and 17-19% respectively) were \nlower (Figures 2b).  \n \nFigure 2  Tree and crop yields in cherry, walnut, poplar, oak, and pine silvoarable systems \nat a) 113 trees ha-1 and b) 50 trees ha-1, relative to monoculture yields  (error bars show \nconfidence intervals for mean values). \n \na) Spain b) France c) the Netherlands \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nWheat Sunflower\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \ncr\nop\n y\nie\nld\n \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nWheat Oilseed Sunflow er Grain maize\n113 trees 50 trees  \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nWheat Forage\nmaize\n \nFigure 3  Crop yields in silvoarable systems of 113 and 50 trees ha-1 in a) Spain and b) \nFrance under all tree species, and c) the Netherlands under poplar, relative to \nmonoculture yields (error bars show the maximum and minimum values in each group) \na)  113 trees ha-1 b)  50 trees ha-1 \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nCherry Walnut Poplar Oak Pine\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \nyi\nel\nd\nRelative tree yield\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nCherry Walnut Poplar Oak Pine\nRelative crop yield\n 13\n  \nLand equivalent ratios \nWith a few exceptions, and including thinnings for timber and a full rotation for crop \nyields, the predicted land equivalent ratios of the silvoarable systems (Equation 1) at \nboth 113 and 50 trees ha-1 were between 1 and 1.4.  Hence the Yield-SAFE model \npredicted that, under typical management, integrating crops and trees on the same area \nof land was more productive than growing them separately.  The relationship between \nrelative tree and crop yields suggested that the land equivalent ratio would form a \nconvex arc, with maximum values obtained when the trees and crops had similar \nrelative yields, and minimum values where either the tree or crop component was \ndominant (Figures 4a and b).  At each landscape test site, the land equivalent ratio at \n113 trees ha-1 (Figure 4a) was greater than that at 50 trees ha-1 (Figure 4b).  At both tree \ndensities, the highest land equivalent ratios were associated with poplar, walnut and \ncherry systems in France (Figure 4); the lowest land equivalent ratios were associated \nwith oak and pine in Spain.   \n \na) 113 trees per hectare \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\nRelative crop yield\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \ntre\ne \nyi\nel\nd\nOak (Spain)\nPine (Spain)\nCherry (France)\nPoplar (France)\nWalnut (France)\nPoplar (Netherlands)\n \nb) 50 trees per hectare \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\nRelative crop yield\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \ntre\ne \nyi\nel\nd\n \nFigure 4  Relationship between relative crop yield and relative tree yield for the walnut \nand poplar (France and the Netherlands), cherry (France), and oak and pine silvoarable \nsystems (Spain) at a) 113 trees ha-1 and b) 50 trees ha-1.  \n \n 14\nDefinition of revenue, costs and grants  \nThe revenue and costs associated with the tree and crop systems are fully described by \nGraves (2005).  However, for clarity some key values are described here. \n \nArable and silvoarable crop component finance \nThe values for arable crops ranged from 85 \u20ac t-1 for grain maize to 280 \u20ac t-1 for \nsunflower; the values for wheat grain ranged from 102 to 142 \u20ac t-1.  The variable costs \ntended to be lowest in Spain, at between 45 and 189 \u20ac ha-1, and highest in the \nNetherlands, at between 457 and 479 \u20ac ha-1.  The assignable fixed costs, such as \nmachinery and labour costs, followed a similar pattern, tending to be lowest in Spain \nand highest in the Netherlands.    \n \nForestry and silvoarable tree component finance \nIn Spain, the values recorded for oak (17 \u20ac m-3) and pine (8-19 \u20ac m-3) were relatively \nlow.  By contrast, in France, the values recorded for walnut (40-1300 \u20ac m-3), wild cherry \n(10-380 \u20ac m-3), and poplar (7-55 \u20ac m-3) were relatively high.  In the Netherlands, the \nvalue recorded for walnut (18-41 \u20ac m-3) was much lower than in France, but the value of \npoplar (19-97 \u20ac m-3) was slightly higher.   \n \nThe establishment costs of forestry systems were greatest in the Netherlands (3420 \u20ac ha-\n1 for walnut; 1940 \u20ac ha-1 for poplar) and lowest in Spain (770 \u20ac ha-1) for oak systems at \n400 trees ha-1.  The establishment costs for forestry systems of cherry (1510 \u20ac ha-1), \nwalnut (1633 \u20ac ha-1), and poplar (1260 \u20ac ha-1) in France and high density oak (1470 \u20ac \nha-1) and pine (1786 \u20ac ha-1) in Spain were intermediate.  The establishment cost of the \ntree component in the 113 tree ha-1 silvoarable systems ranged from 1200 \u20ac ha-1 for \nwalnut in the Netherlands, to 233 \u20ac ha-1 for oak in Spain.  Management costs after \nestablishment were highest for the systems in France and the Netherlands, where control \nof undergrowth and pruning involved substantial costs.  In addition, in the Netherlands, \nan annual opportunity cost of 408 \u20ac ha-1 was assumed for arable land converted to \nforest, because of the problem of finding land for slurry application; this cost was \napplied on a pro-rata basis to the tree-rows in the silvoarable system.   \n \nGrant regimes \nUnder the pre-2005 grant regime, the cash value (discount rate = 0%) of forestry \npayments was greatest in the Netherlands and lowest in France (Table 5).  The arable \narea payments were marginally greater in the Netherlands than in France, but both were \nmuch greater than those for the chosen systems in Spain.   \n \nTable 5  The predicted value of government support (\u20ac ha-1), over a full tree-rotation (60 \nyears for oak, pine walnut and cherry; 20 years for poplar), for forestry, arable and \nsilvoarable systems in the pre-2005 grant regime, and the predicted change in that support \nin a post-2005 grant regime (scenario 1 and scenario 2) \n \n 15\nCountry, tree species and \nland unit \nPre-2005 government support  Predicted net change in support with the post-\n2005 grant regime \n Rotation \n(a) \nForestry Arable Silvoarable  Forestry Arable Silvoarable \nscenario 1 \nSilvoarable \nscenario 2 \nSpain           \nOak Alcala 1 60  6860  5170  2010  -2940  8030  10010  11410  \n Alcala 2 60  6860  5170  2690  -2940  8030  9320  10730  \n Torrijos 1 60  9380  3870  1410  -4190  210  820  1260  \n Torrijos 2 60  9380  5170  1920  -4180  270  1790  2380  \n Oca\u00f1a 1 60  9380  5170  1770  -4190  350  2120  2860  \n Almonacid 1 60  9380  3870  1380  -4190  600  2010  2710  \n Almonacid 2 60  9370  8770  4080  -4180  -1030  2980  3890  \n Cardenosa 1 60  8860  5810  2900  -3380  -590  1850  2540  \n Cardenosa 2 60  8860  5810  2670  -3390  -590  2080  2770  \n Fontiveros 1 60  8850  6200  2940  -3380  950  3570  4430  \n Olmedo 2 60  8860  5160  2260  -3390  600  2990  3720  \n Olmedo 3 60  8860  6100  2520  -3380  -340  2720  3460  \n Campo 2 60  8860  6460  2610  -3380  1990  4160  6060  \n Paramo 1 60  8860  6760  3080  -3390  2500  5350  6400  \n Paramo 2 60  8860  6760  3080  -3390  2500  5350  6400  \n Paramo 3 60  8860  6760  3060  -3390  2500  5370  6420  \nPine Fontiveros 2 60  8000  6200  2060  -2960  950  4450  5340  \n Olmedo 1 60  8010  6100  1780  -2970  -340  3470  4220  \n Campo 1 60  8010  5810  1050  -2970  1790  2640  4260  \nFrance          \nCherry Champdeniers 1 60  4440  21180  16130  0  0  -390  1560  \n Fussy 3 60  3840  21090  19590  0  -30  -430  1870  \n Sancerre 3 60  3840  20860  19380  0  -70  -460  1800  \n Fussy 1 60  3840  21090  19590  0  -30  -420  1870  \n Chateauroux 2 60  3840  21000  19510  0  -50  -440  1840  \n Chateauroux 4 60  3840  21000  19510  0  -50  -440  1840  \n Sancerre 4 60  3850  20940  19450  0  -150  -530  1740  \n Sancerre 1 60  3840  20860  19380  0  -70  -460  1810  \n Champlitte 1 60  0  20080  11880  0  -100  -60  2170  \n Dampierre 1 60  0  21040  15320  0  -1300  -1550  870  \n Vitrey 1 60  0  19840  14450  0  -60  -50  2760  \n Dampierre 2 60  0  20940  12700  0  -1200  -730  860  \nWalnut Champdeniers 2 60  4270  21180  16440  0  0  -700  1570  \n Chateauroux 3 60  3670  20800  19630  0  150  -570  2030  \n Chateauroux 1 60  3680  21000  19820  0  -50  -750  1840  \n Champlitte 2 60  0  19880  3920  0  100  20  3450  \nPoplar Sancerre 2 20  2720  6940  6850  0  -10  -540  610  \n Fussy 2 20  2720  6960  6870  0  60  -480  680  \n Dampierre 3 20  0  7080  3870  0  -500  -280  610  \n Vitrey 2 20  0  6600  3610  0  -10  -10  880  \nNetherlands \nWalnut Bentelo 60  11810  23000  5230  -1980  -1820  -410  2810  \nPoplar Balkbrug 20  11810  8000  3640  -3310  0  0  1030  \n Sherpenzeel 20  11810  8000  4370  -3640  0  0  1100  \n  \n \nIn Spain, support for silvoarable agroforestry was lower than for forestry and the arable \nsystems, because of ineligibility for tree grants and reduction of the crop payments \naccording to a canopy area based calculation.  In France, in Poitou Charentes and Centre \n(Champdeniers, Fussy, Sancerre, and Chateauroux), arable payments were at least five-\ntimes the value of forestry payments; the value of silvoarable payments was marginally \n 16\nless than that for arable systems.  In Champlitte, Dampierre, and Vitrey in Franche \nComt\u00e9, there were no forestry payments.  Support for walnut and poplar forestry in the \nNetherlands was identical, because both were assumed to be temporary, production-\nbased systems.  Since arable payments were dependent on the length of the tree rotation, \nthey were greater for walnut (Bentelo) than for poplar (Balkbrug and Scherpenzeel).  In \neach case, the support for silvoarable systems was less than for forestry and arable \nsystems, as no payments were received for the tree component.   \n \nIn the post-2005 grant regime, existing levels of payments for forestry applied where \nthey were in accordance with the rural development strategy of the European Union \n(European Commission, 2004).  There was therefore no change in France.  However in \nSpain and the Netherlands, planting payments were changed to 50% of tree costs in the \nfirst four years and the compensation payments and maintenance grants were reduced to \n500 \u20ac ha-1 a-1 with a maximum duration of 10 years, unless they were already below \nthese levels.  In general, arable and especially silvoarable payments were predicted to \nincrease in Spain.  The predicted value of the new single farm payment at Alcala, \nParamo and Campo was greater than pre-2005 area payments, as the generous support \nfor non-arable activities on the farms typical of these areas, was assumed to be re-\nallocated on an area basis.  In France, there were only marginal changes for arable \nsystems, due to modulation under the single farm payment.  For silvoarable systems, \nscenario 1 was generally similar to the pre-2005 regime but marginal benefits were \nevident under scenario 2.     \n \nPlot-scale economic results \nProfitability with no grants \nThe equivalent annual values of the forestry systems with oak and stone pine in Spain, \npoplar and walnut in the Netherlands, and cherry in France were negative (Table 6).    \nOnly walnut and poplar in France was profitable.  The equivalent annual values of the \narable system were positive at Alcala, Cardenosa, Fontiveros, Olmedo and Paramo in \nSpain, at Champdeniers, Chateauroux, Fussy and Sancerre in France, and at all sites in \nthe Netherlands.  By contrast the returns from arable systems were negative in Torrijos, \nOca\u00f1a and Campo and at most sites in Franche Comt\u00e9 (i.e. at Dampierre and Vitrey) \n(Table 6).   The equivalent annual value of the silvoarable systems in Spain were \nmarginally below those for the arable system.  By contrast, in France, values for the \nsilvoarable systems with walnut, with poplar in Centre, and with wild cherry in Poitou \nCharentes and Franche Comt\u00e9 were higher than those for both arable cropping and \nforestry.  In the Netherlands, the values for the silvoarable system with poplar were \nmarginally greater than the arable system, but the value for the silvoarable system with \nwalnut was negative (Table 6).   \n 17\nTable 6  Equivalent annual value (\u20ac ha-1 a-1) (discount rate of 4%) of the arable, forestry, and silvoarable \n(113 trees ha-1) system in Spain, France and the Netherlands, a) without grants, b) under the pre-2005 \ngrant regime, and c) the post-2005 grant regime (scenario 1 and 2). \nCountry, tree species a)  No grants b)   Pre-2005 c) Post-2005 \nand land unit Forestry Crop Silvoarable Forest CropSilvoarable \n \nForest CropSilvoarable\nscenario 1\nSilvoarable \nscenario 2 \nSpain         \nOak Alcala 1 -57 99 67 184 191 125 97 333 279 310 \n Alcala 2 -50 47 30 190 139 97 103 281 242 272 \n Torrijos 1 -36 -13 -5 290 56 23 166 59 36 51 \n Torrijos 2 -37 -39 -9 289 53 11 166 57 35 52 \n Oca\u00f1a 1 -37 -32 -11 289 59 29 166 66 42 50 \n Almonacid 1 -40 -20 -13 286 48 -56 163 59 36 52 \n Almonacid 2 -46 18 0 280 172 108 157 154 124 145 \n Cardenosa 1 -59 113 98 245 215 172 156 205 182 200 \n Cardenosa 2 -55 115 98 248 218 169 160 207 181 199 \n Fontiveros 1 -56 100 72 248 210 162 159 226 200 221 \n Olmedo 2 -54 58 38 250 149 105 161 160 136 154 \n Olmedo 3 -55 8 -9 248 115 62 160 109 85 103 \n Campo 2 -57 -54 -25 247 61 8 158 96 61 84 \n Paramo 1 -51 196 176 253 315 258 164 360 325 349 \n Paramo 2 -51 196 176 253 315 258 164 360 325 349 \n Paramo 3 -50 195 175 253 314 257 165 359 324 348 \nPine Fontiveros 2 -80 100 57 190 210 129 118 227 181 203 \n Olmedo 1 -80 7 -15 190 115 34 118 109 71 90 \n Campo 1 -80 -73 -34 190 30 -9 118 61 13 34 \nFrance \nCherry Champdeniers 1 -111 14 68 63 380 353 63 381 336 384 \n Chateauroux 2 -152 35 40 0 398 353 0 398 335 385 \n Chateauroux 4 -153 31 37 -2 395 349 -2 394 332 382 \n Fussy 1 -166 114 79 -14 479 399 -14 479 381 431 \n Fussy 3 -90 317 277 62 682 607 62 682 589 639 \n Sancerre 1 -155 18 15 -3 380 327 -3 379 309 359 \n Sancerre 3 -59 249 262 92 610 580 92 609 561 611 \n Sancerre 4 -146 24 31 6 387 341 6 384 321 371 \n Champlitte 1 -73 127 187 -73 474 435 -73 473 434 478 \n Dampierre 1 -79 48 120 -79 412 408 -79 390 390 435 \n Dampierre 2 -144 -207 -37 -144 156 131 -144 135 115 159 \n Vitrey 1 -108 -61 16 -108 283 256 -108 282 256 301 \nWalnut Champdeniers 2 227 91 296 394 458 535 394 459 504 566 \n Chateauroux 1 182 154 287 327 517 578 327 517 547 610 \n Chateauroux 3 231 269 354 376 629 691 376 632 662 726 \n Champlitte 2 224 -166 227 224 178 296 224 180 297 342 \nPoplar Fussy 2 232 219 318 417 581 634 417 584 598 670 \n Sancerre 2 414 271 508 599 632 803 599 631 764 835 \n Dampierre 3 309 -132 270 309 236 401 309 210 385 445 \n Vitrey 2 262 -128 250 262 215 358 262 215 357 417 \nNetherlands        \nWalnut Bentelo 1 -1063 248 -161 -659 646 -16 -669 615 -30 36 \nPoplar Balkbrugg 1 -521 187 216 151 603 356 35 603 356 426 \n Scherpenzeel 1 -756 131 140 -84 547 310 -221 547 310 384 \n \n 18\n \nPre-2005 grant regime \nIn the pre-2005 grant regime (Table 6), the equivalent annual values of forestry systems \nin Spain were generally higher than those of arable systems, except where crop yields \nwere high.  The equivalent annual values of silvoarable systems were generally lower \nthan for forestry and arable systems.  In France, the equivalent annual values of arable \nsystems were generally greater than those for wild cherry silvoarable systems, which \nwere much greater than those for wild cherry forestry.  The predicted equivalent annual \nvalues of the poplar and walnut silvoarable systems were higher than those for both \nforestry and arable systems.  In the Netherlands, the equivalent annual values of arable \nsystems were greatest, followed by those for silvoarable and then forestry systems.     \n \nPost-2005 grant regime \nIn the post-2005 grant regime (Table 6), the equivalent annual values for forestry in \nSpain declined in comparison with those for forestry in the pre-2005 grant regime, but \nincreased for arable and silvoarable systems despite modulation.  In France, the \nequivalent annual values were broadly similar to those under the pre-2005 regime, \nalthough for silvoarable systems, scenario 1 resulted in marginal reductions, while \nscenario 2 resulted in marginal increases in equivalent annual values.  In the \nNetherlands, a substantial decrease in the equivalent annual values of forestry was \npredicted, but the change in the equivalent annual values of arable systems was \nmarginal.  For silvoarable systems, little change was predicted for scenario 1, but a \nsmall and consistent increase was predicted for scenario 2.   \n \nFarm-scale analysis \nIn Spain under the pre-2005 grant regime, there were no cases where establishing a \nsilvoarable system increased farm profitability relative to the status quo (Figure 5).  By \ncontrast, under the pre-2005 grant regime, forestry was attractive in about 80% of cases.  \nThe post-2005 regime was predicted to reduce the relative profitability of forestry, but \nforestry still remained financially attractive on about 50% of the selected farms.  In \nFrance, under the pre-2005 grant regime, silvoarable systems were predicted to increase \nfarm profitability in approximately 50% of cases.  This frequency remained similar \nunder scenario 1 of the post-2005 grant regime, and increased to 80% under scenario 2.  \nThe proportion of farms where forestry was attractive (20%) was less than for \nsilvoarable systems and was the same for both the pre- and post 2005 grant regimes.  In \nthe Netherlands (not shown), the introduction of forestry and silvoarable systems \nalways reduced farm profitability under both pre- and post-2005 grant regimes.  \n 19\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSpain France Spain France Spain France\nPre-2005 Post-2005 scenario 1 Post-2005 scenario 2\nCountry and grant regime\nP\nro\npo\nrti\non\n o\nf c\nas\nes\n (%\n)\nSilvoarable agroforestry Forestry\n \nFigure 5 Proportion of cases where the net present value of hypothetical arable farms was \nimproved by introducing silvoarable systems (113 trees ha-1) and forestry systems (Spain: \nn =17; France: n = 14).   \n \nIn Spain, the use of silvoarable systems was preferable to forestry in 12% of cases under \nthe pre-2005 grant regime and 50% of cases in scenarios 1 and 2 of the post-2005 grant \nregime (Figure 6).

This process provided a systematic method for determining the \neffects of tree spacing, tree and crop species, and grant regime on the profitability of \nsilvoarable systems relative to arable and forestry systems.   \n \nBiophysical modelling of yields \nIn Spain, the relative yields of autumn-planted crops, such as wheat, tended to be \ngreater than those for spring-planted crops, such as sunflower (Figure 3a).  As oak and \nstone pine are evergreen trees and competition for light was similar for both spring- and \nautumn-planted crops, this may have been due to greater competition for water \nexperienced by the spring-planted crop.  In France, the difference in the relative yield of \nthe autumn- (i.e. wheat and oilseed) and spring-planted (sunflower and grain maize) \ncrops was larger than in Spain (Figure 3b).   This was probably due to reduced \ncompetition for light, because the tree species planted in France were deciduous, and \nhence had no leaves for a large proportion of the growing period of the autumn-planted \ncrops.  In the Netherlands (Figure 3c), the differences between relative yields of \nautumn-planted wheat and spring-planted forage maize under poplar followed the same \npattern.  Similar benefits from using autumn- rather than spring-planted crops were \nobserved by Burgess et al. (2004) with poplar in the UK.  Relative timber yields varied \naccording to density and species (Figure 2).  Timber production on a per tree basis was \ngreater at 50 than at 113 trees ha-1 per tree resource use was greater at lower densities.  \nHowever, per area timber production was greatest for 113 trees ha-1 and for wild cherry, \nwalnut, and poplar, suggesting that higher tree densities and faster-growing species had \nallowed the tree component to capture a greater share of the available resources.   \n \nAlthough Yield-SAFE predicted lower timber yields and crop yields per hectare for \nsilvoarable systems compared to the arable and forestry systems respectively (Figure 2), \nthe total productivity of silvoarable systems, determined with land equivalent ratios, \nwas predicted to be between 100 and 140% that of the monoculture systems (Figure 4).  \nThe highest ratios were obtained by integrating deciduous trees and autumn-planted \ncrops, which were complementary in terms of light use, suggesting that silvoarable \nsystems would be most advantageous over arable and forestry monocropping, where \nsuch species can be combined.  High land equivalent ratios were also associated with \nthe higher tree stand densities of 113 rather than of 50 trees ha-1, suggesting that at 50 \ntrees ha-1 silvoarable systems were sub-optimal in terms of light and water use, and that \nthe higher tree stand density would be preferable for increased productivity.  Finally, \nhigh land equivalent ratios at both tree densities were associated with faster growing \ntrees like poplar, walnut, and wild cherry in France whilst in Spain, oak and pine \nsystems at both densities were associated with much lower land equivalent ratios \n(Figure 4).  The reasons for this are not clear.  It may be that oak and pine growth was \nso slow that neither species was able to make use of available resources at the densities \nused in the silvoarable systems; alternatively, it is possible that crops competed more \nstrongly for water than other trees of the same species.  In either case, production \nbenefits from oak and pine-based silvoarable systems in Spain appear to be limited \n 21\nunless the density can be increased without detriment to the relative yield of either \ncomponent. \n \nGrant regimes \nIn the pre-2005 grant regime, support for silvoarable systems was frequently less than \nthat for arable and forestry systems.  In arable systems, crop payments in Spain (129-\n176 \u20ac ha-1) and in France and the Netherlands (324-400 \u20ac ha-1) were obtained for every \nyear of cropping.  In forestry, systems, generous schemes could make forestry payments \ngreater then silvoarable payments.  Thus in Spain, planting grants of 849-1593 \u20ac ha-1, \ncompensation payments of 225-325 \u20ac ha-1 a-1 for 20 years, and maintenance payments \nof 180-288 \u20ac ha-1 a-1 for five years, could be obtained.  In the Netherlands, planting \ngrants of 95% of costs up to a maximum of 1500 \u20ac ha-1, compensation payments of 100 \n\u20ac ha-1 a-1 for five years, and maintenance payments of 545 \u20ac ha-1 a-1 for 18 years, were \navailable.  However, guidelines developed for payments on silvoarable systems resulted \nin disadvantages.  These included termination of crop payments if cropping stopped \nbefore the tree rotation finished and reduction of crop payments by the cropped \nproportion of the system in France and the Netherlands, and by twice the proportion of \nthe tree canopy in the system in Spain.  Payments on the tree component did not \ncompensate for these losses.  In the Poitou Charentes and Centre regions of France, \nplanting grants covered 50% of tree costs in the first four years of the tree rotation, but \nin Spain, the Netherlands and the Franche Comt\u00e9 region in France, the tree component \nreceived no payments at all.   \n \nUnder the post-2005 grant regime, the per hectare value of the single farm payments in \nSpain (68-220 \u20ac ha-1 a-1) were higher than crop payments under the pre-2005 grant \nregime, because payments for other farm activities were included in the calculation.  In \nFrance and the Netherlands the per hectare value of the single farm payments (329-400 \n\u20ac ha-1 a-1) declined marginally because of modulation.  Forestry payments in Spain and \nthe Netherlands also declined, mostly because the duration of compensation payments \nwas reduced from 20 and 18 years respectively, to 10 years.  In France, little change \nwas evident for forestry.  However, support for silvoarable systems generally improved \nrelative to arable and forestry systems.  For example, silvoarable payments for both \nscenarios 1 and 2 in Spain, were greatly improved in absolute terms and relative to \npayments for arable and forestry systems.  In France and the Netherlands, the difference \nwas less striking, although in the Netherlands, the value of silvoarable payments \nimproved substantially relative to forestry payments.  Under scenario 2, where a \nplanting grant was added to the full single farm payment, absolute payments on \nsilvoarable systems could marginally exceeded payments for arable systems (providing \ncropping did not stop before the tree rotation ended).  In these circumstances, farmers \nmight be encouraged to retain existing trees already on arable land, since they are no \nlonger the direct cause of lost payments.  However, the planting grants calculated for \nSpain (214-370 \u20ac ha-1), France (393-793 \u20ac ha-1), and the Netherlands (670-1133 \u20ac ha-1) \nare small in proportion to the total grant payable for maintaining the land in arable \nproduction and, on their own, are unlikely to encourage widespread adoption of \nsilvoarable systems.   \n \n 22\nPlot-scale economics \nWithout grants, silvoarable systems were frequently the most profitable system at the \nlandscape test sites (Table 6).  In Spain, oak and stone pine silvoarable systems were the \nmost profitable system in six of 19 land units.   In France, walnut silvoarable systems \nwere the most profitable system in four out of four land units, poplar silvoarable \nsystems the most profitable system in two out of four land units, and wild cherry \nsilvoarable systems the most profitable system in nine out of 12 land units.  In the \nNetherlands, poplar silvoarable systems were the most profitable system in two out of \ntwo land units.   \n \nHowever, the pre-2005 grant regime altered the profitability of silvoarable systems, \nrelative to arable and forestry systems (Table 6).  This was especially the case in Spain, \nwhere silvoarable systems became the least profitable system on all 19 land units.  In \nFrance, walnut silvoarable systems remained the most profitable system on each of the \nfour land units and poplar silvoarable profitability increased relative to forestry to also \nbecame the most profitable system on the four land units.  Wild cherry silvoarable \nsystems became less profitable then arable systems, but remained more profitable than \nforestry systems on all 12 land units.  In the Netherlands, poplar silvoarable systems \nbecame less profitable than arable systems and more profitable then forestry systems; \nthe relative profitability of walnut silvoarable systems remained less profitable than the \narable system, but more profitable than the forestry system. \n   \nUnder scenarios 1 and 2 of the post-2005 grant regime, support for silvoarable systems \nwas generally predicted to be more equitable in comparison with the pre-2005 grant \nregime.  Hence, in Spain, the profitability of oak and stone pine silvoarable systems \nnow frequently exceeded that of forestry systems and became only marginally less than \nthat of arable systems on all 19 land units.  Since oak and stone pine are important for \ntheir landscape value, the small difference between the equivalent annual values of the \nsilvoarable and arable systems (5-54 \u20ac ha-1 a-1) represents the minimum level of \nadditional support, perhaps as an agri-environment payment, required for silvoarable \nsystems to become financially attractive to farmers.  In France, the relative profitability \nof silvoarable, arable, and forestry systems for scenario 1 was similar to that in the pre-\n2005 grant regime, and increased marginally for scenario 2, so that wild cherry \nsilvoarable systems also became the most profitable systems in six of 12 land units.  \nWalnut and poplar silvoarable systems continued to be the most profitable systems in all \neight land units, in both scenarios 1 and 2, demonstrating the importance of using high \nvalue (walnut) or short rotation (poplar) trees in silvoarable systems.  In the \nNetherlands, the relative profitability of silvoarable systems in comparison with the \narable and forestry systems remained unchanged under both scenarios.  The \ndisadvantage of using long rotation and low value timber was illustrated by the use of \nwalnut in the Netherlands.  The importance of fully understanding all the costs \nassociated with changing land use was illustrated by the high opportunity cost of losing \nland for slurry manure application, which made forestry relatively unprofitable under all \nthe grant regimes.   \n    \nFarm-scale economics \nThe effect of using silvoarable agroforestry was examined firstly in terms of its impact \non the profitability of hypothetical farms and secondly as a means of establishing trees \n 23\non farms.  Under the pre-2005 grant regime in Spain, it was unprofitable to replace \narable systems with silvoarable systems.  This was due to low timber volume and value, \nand especially due to the lack of tree grants and the loss of arable area payments under \nthe canopy-area based calculation.   Under the post-2005 grant regime, replanting arable \nland with silvoarable systems still reduced farm profitability.  By contrast, in France, \nestablishing walnut and poplar silvoarable systems increased farm profitability under \nboth the pre- and post-2005 grant regimes.  Wild cherry silvoarable systems generally \ndecreased farm profitability, due to low timber values and long rotations, except \noccasionally under scenario 2 of the post-2005 grant regime.  In the Netherlands, \nintroducing silvoarable systems in place of arable systems reduced farm profitability \nunder both the pre- and the post-2005 grant regimes.  \n \nUnder the pre-2005 grant regime in Spain, forestry generally provided a more cost \neffective means of establishing trees on farms than silvoarable agroforestry, because of \nhigh levels of support for forestry systems.  However, under the post-2005 grant regime, \nit was predicted that silvoarable agroforestry would become the most profitable means \nof establishing trees on farms in a substantial number of cases.  In France and the \nNetherlands, silvoarable systems with walnut, wild cherry, and poplar provided the \nmost profitable means of establishing trees on farms, irrespective of grant regime used.   \n \nConclusions and recommendations \nLand equivalent ratios developed using Yield-SAFE predictions were consistently \nabove one, indicating that growing trees and crops in silvoarable systems was more \nproductive than growing them separately.  Conditions that most favoured high land \nequivalent ratios appeared to include the use of relatively high tree-densities to make \nfull use of available resources, the use of deciduous trees and autumn-planted crops to \nmake complementary use of light, and high soil water availability to ensure that extra \nbiomass production could be sustained.  Conversely, low land equivalent ratios were \nassociated with low tree density, evergreen trees, spring-planted crops, and low soil \nwater availability.    \n \nThe financial predictions made by FarmSAFE indicated that silvoarable systems were \nmost attractive where both components of the system were profitable as moncultures, \nsince an unprofitable, or relatively unprofitable component, also reduced the \nprofitability of the mixed system.  In addition, the relative profitability of silvoarable \nsystems tended to be maximised if the profitability of the forestry and arable systems \nwas similar.  Under the two scenarios proposed for the post-2005 grant regimes, it was \npredicted that silvoarable systems with walnut and poplar in France could provide a \nprofitable alternative to arable or forestry systems.  The importance of using high value \ntrees such as walnut, or short rotation trees such as poplar, was illustrated by use of \nthese trees in France.  In Spain, it was predicted that holm oak and stone pine \nsilvoarable systems would cause only small reductions in crop yields, relative to those \nin arable systems.  Since these trees are of ecological and landscape importance for \nexample, in areas of open woodlands (dehesas), rather than of productive importance, \nadditional support in the form of an agri-environment payment could be justified.  A \nmoderate annual amount would be sufficient to overcome income losses caused by yield \nreductions and encourage tree establishment for non-productive benefits.  In the \nNetherlands, the low value of timber and an opportunity cost, assumed because of the \n 24\nloss of arable land for slurry manure application, made both silvoarable and forestry \nsystems relatively unattractive in comparison with arable systems. \n \nA number of recommendations regarding further research can be made.  Predictions are \nsubject to uncertainty and this could be examined using sensitivity analysis or stochastic \nmodelling.  Certain baseline data should also be re-examined.  For example, the \nrecorded value of walnut timber in the Netherlands and France differed greatly, even \nthough both countries are part of a free-trade zone.  In the Netherlands, assumptions \nregarding slurry manure should be re-examined, since these greatly undermine the \nprofitability of tree-based systems.  In Spain, assumptions regarding beating-up, tree \nmanagement and the availability of grants should be re-assessed.  Tree mortality is \nlikely to be high due to difficult conditions, and pruning and thinning costs, whilst valid \nfor traditional management of trees in dehesas, may not be valid for forestry and \nsilvoarable systems, even if these are established in such areas.  Finally,  the post-2005 \ngrant regime should be re-assessed, as the impact of the European Union\u2019s rural \ndevelopment strategy will become clearer in time.    \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis research was carried out as part of the SAFE (Silvoarable Agroforestry for Europe) \ncollaborative research project.
