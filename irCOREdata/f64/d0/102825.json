Research into the search\nfor the proposed b-C3N4 phase, which is predicted to be\nharder than diamond was initiated by Liu and Cohen.1 As a\nresult of nitrogen incorporation into carbon films it was\nfound that both optical and electrical properties,2\u20134 as well as\ntheir mechanical properties5\u20137 can be modified. Particularly\nwith respect to the mechanical properties, it was found that\nnitrogen incorporation results in a substantial reduction of\nthe compressive internal stress of the films. The improve-\nment in adhesion that resulted from the stress reduction has\nmade it possible to use amorphous hydrogenated carbon\u2013\nnitrogen @a-C~N!:H# films as antireflective coatings in Ge\nbased IR sensors.7\nOne of the key factors in determining the structure and\nproperties of hard amorphous carbon films is the hybridiza-\ntion state of the atoms that form the amorphous network.8\nPrevious results on a-C~N!:H films9 allude to an increase in\nthe graphitic clustering (sp2 bonding! upon nitrogen incor-\nporation, which may be correlated to the observed internal\nstress reduction.5 A similar reduction in stress is observed for\nhighly tetrahedral C:N films10,11 in which nitrogen incorpo-\nration above 1 at. % resulted in both stress reduction and\nincrease in the sp2 carbon fraction.\nAll of the above-cited deposition studies on a-C~N!:H\nfilms are based on addition of N2 to the deposition atmo-\nsphere, in the deposition of the a-C films. To date, few re-\nsearchers have studied the use of ammonia as the source gas\nfor nitrogen.12,13 Contrary to the above research, Seth et al.12\nreported an increase in the sp3 carbon atoms fraction upon\nnitrogen incorporation in a-C~N!:H films deposited by\nPECVD in C4H6\u2013NH3 atmospheres.

The\ncompressive internal stress was also measured and correlated\nwith the other results.\nThe a-C~N!:H films were produced by plasma decompo-\nsition of CH4\u2013NH3 and CH4\u2013N2 mixtures, with the NH3\npartial pressure in the plasma ranging from 0% to 12.5%,\nand that of N2 ranging from 0% to 50%. The films were\ndeposited on single-crystal Si~100! substrates, which were\nplaced on the water-cooled, rf ~13.56 MHz! powered elec-\ntrode of a diode configured glow-discharge system. The\ndepositions were performed at a total pressure of 8 Pa and a\ndc self-bias of 2370 V. In order to control the dc self-bias\nduring depositions, a rf power of 5262 W was applied. The\nchemical composition of the films was obtained from nuclear\ntechniques\u2014RBS, ERDA and nuclear reactions\u2014as de-\nscribed previously.14 Results from the nuclear technique\nanalysis, combined with film thickness measurements with a\nstylus profilometer, were used to calculate the density of the\nfilms. Profilometry was also used to determine the internal\ncompressive stress by measuring the curvature of the sub-\nstrate.\nThe hybridization states of carbon and nitrogen atoms\nwere determined by electron energy loss spectroscopy\n~EELS!, which was carried out on a Philips CM30 transmis-\nsion electron microscope ~TEM! fitted with a Gatan 666\nEELS spectrometer operated at 100 keV at a collection angle\nof 10 mrad. Samples were prepared by lifting off the films by\ndissolving the Si substrate in HF:HNO3 diluted in deionized\nwater and then floating them onto Cu TEM grids. The EELS\nC and N K edge spectra contain a peak corresponding to the\n1s to p* transition followed by a step ~'5 eV above! which\narises due to the 1s to s* transition.

The nitrogen K edge spectra are\nsimilar in shape and have the N 1s\u2013p* and 1s\u2013s* transi-\ntions, at energies around 399 and 407 eV, respectively. The\nsp2 fraction of carbon and nitrogen atoms is calculated using\nthe normalized area under the p* peak and then comparing\nthis to that of a 100% sp2 bonded graphite standard.15\nThe chemical composition as a function of the partial\npressures of N2 and NH3 in the plasma is listed in Table I.\nThe nitrogen incorporation level\u2014up to 11 at. % for both\nseries of films\u2014lies within the range of values reported in\nthe literature for plasma deposited a-C~N!:H films, which are\nalways smaller than 20 at. %.2,3,5\u20137,16,17 The hydrogen con-\ntent as well as the atomic density show different behavior for\nthe two series of samples. For the same amount of incorpo-\nrated nitrogen, the hydrogen content is higher for the\nNH3-derived films. The atomic density is almost constant for\nboth series of nitrogenated films. For the films deposited\nfrom CH4\u2013N2 mixtures, the density shows the same value\nthat was obtained from the nitrogen free sample. For the\nNH3-derived films a density decrease of about 20% is ob-\nserved.\nThe dependence of the sp2 fraction of the carbon atoms\nf C(sp2) as a function of the nitrogen content in the film is\nplotted in Fig. 2. The fC(sp2) value that we obtained for the\nnitrogen-free sample ~'0.5! lies within the range normally\nobserved in a-C:H films.8 For the nitrogenated samples, in\nboth cases, there is a steeper initial increase in the carbon\nsp2 fraction for nitrogen contents smaller than 5 at. %. For\nhigher nitrogen incorporation, the carbon sp2 fraction shows\nFIG. 1. The C K edge electron energy loss spectra of a-C~N!:H films de-\nposited using gas mixtures of CH4\u2013N2.

The NH3-derived films show a variation that is dif-\nficult to resolve from that observed for N2-derived films.\nThe above discussed variation in f C(sp2) contrasts with\nthe results reported by Seth et al.12 on a-C~N!:H films ob-\ntained by PECVD in C4H6\u2013N2 and C4H6\u2013NH3 atmo-\nspheres. Despite not observing a significant change on the\nhybridization state of carbon atoms upon nitrogen incorpora-\ntion using N2 , those authors reported an increase in the car-\nbon sp3\/sp2 bond ratio by a factor of about 50% with the\nuse of NH3 . Our results show a strong increase in the sp2\nfraction of the carbon atoms, for both nitrogen precursor\ngases. The increase in the sp2 character agrees with previ-\nously reported work on nitrogen incorporation within carbon\nfilms by using either plasma or ion beam deposition meth-\nods; as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy,9 by electrical and\noptical properties in a-C~N!:H films,16,17 and by EELS in\nhighly tetrahedral C:N films at high atomic N contents.10,11,18\nThe observed strong initial increase in f C(sp2) indicates a\nstrong inductive effect, which is similar to that observed by\nothers in ta-C:N films.10,11 The increase in the sp2 fraction of\nFIG. 2.

The films are highly\nstressed, with stress values consistent with that normally ob-\nserved in hard a-C:H films.8 For both nitrogen precursor\ngases, data show a decrease in stress upon nitrogen incorpo-\nration, with distinct dependencies. For the NH3-derived\nsamples, a more subtle decrease is observed, which is fol-\nlowed by an almost constant behavior. For N2-derived films\na continuous decrease is observed in the range of films mea-\nsured. The observed stress reduction was obtained with mi-\nnor changes in the measured Vickers microhardness values,\nwhich are about 20 GPa, for films obtained with both N25\nand NH3 precursors. The relatively small dependence of the\nhardness upon nitrogen incorporation was also observed by\nothers,7,17 for films obtained with similar conditions of total\npressure and substrate bias.\nIt is well known that the high internal compressive\nstresses observed in hard a-C:H films may be viewed as a\nresult of the material being overconstrained. This means that\nthe relatively high sp3 fraction observed in hard a-C:H films,\ncauses the mean atomic coordination number to be higher\nthan the ideal value predicted for a fully constrained\nnetwork.19 Even when the structure of such films are consid-\nered to be graphitic (sp2) carbon clusters dispersed in a net-\nwork of sp3 and sp2 carbon atoms and monovalent hydrogen\natoms, arguments as to an overconstrained network is still\nvalid, as has been discussed.8,20 In this scheme, any stress\nrelief process may be strongly coupled to the mean-atomic\ncoordination number. In the case of a-C~N!:H films the ob-\nserved reduction in stress is conceived to be a consequence\nof changes in both chemical composition and hybridization\nstates.\nNitrogen incorporation itself is a source of reduction in\nthe mean-coordination number since nitrogen atoms prefer to\nbond with three atoms, instead of the four bonds admitted by\nthe carbon. Besides the nitrogen incorporation, the increase\nFIG. 3. Nitrogen atoms sp2 fraction fN(sp2) as a function of nitrogen\ncontent in the film, for N2 and NH3-derived films.Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 68, No. 19, 6 May 1996\nded\u00ac20\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.118.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIin fC(sp2) is also a source of decrease on the mean-atomic\ncoordination number, in agreement with the observed reduc-\ntion in the internal stress. However, the distinct behavior\ndetermined for the two series of films does not seem to be\nonly related to the hybridization state of carbon and nitrogen\natoms. The observed variation in stress for the NH3-de-\nrived series of film does not correspond to the lower\nf C(sp2) values obtained for this series, as compared to that\nobtained for the N2-derived films. The increased coordina-\ntion number for the NH3 series that should arise due to the\nlower f C(sp2) values should show up as an increase in the\ninternal stress. A possible reason for such conflicting behav-\nior may be related to the higher hydrogen content observed\nfor films deposited with the CH4\u2013NH3 mixture. The hydro-\ngen content may also be related to the decrease observed in\nthe atom number density, when compared to N2-derived\nfilms.\nIn conclusion, the influence of the nitrogen precursor gas\nN2 or NH3 , on the chemical composition, hybridization state\nof carbon and nitrogen atoms and compressive internal stress\nof a-C~N!:H films deposited by PECVD is examined. It is\nfound that nitrogen incorporation strongly affects the hybrid-\nization state of carbon atoms by increasing the sp2 fraction\nfor both nitrogen precursors, which is consistent with the\nobserved internal stress reduction. The minor differences ob-\nserved in the stress variation of the two series of films is\nascribed to the enhanced hydrogen content in the\nNH3-derived films, which may also explain the lower atom\nnumber density measured in these films when compared with\nN2 deposited films.\n1A.
