This study combines chemical28\nand molecular approaches in order to define how in situ petroleum hydrocarbon29\ncontamination level affects bacterial community structure of subsurface sediment.30\nHydrocarbon content analysis revealed clearly a gradient of hydrocarbon contamination in31\nboth water and sediment following the basin periphery from the pollution input to the lagoon32\nwater. The nC17 and pristane concentrations suggested alkane biodegradation in the33\nsediments. These results combined with those of Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length34\nPolymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that bacterial35\ncommunities structure was obviously associated with the gradient of oil contamination. The36\nanalysis of bacterial community composition revealed dominance of bacteria related to the37\nProteobacteria phylum (Gamma-, Delta-, Alpha-, Epsilon- and Betaproteobacteria),38\nBacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobium groups, and Spirochaetes, Actinobacteria and39\nCyanobacteria phyla. The adaptation of the bacterial community to oil contamination has not40\nas consequence dominance of known oil-degrader bacteria. Predominance of populations41\nassociated to sulphur cycle is observed. The input station presented particular bacterial42\ncommunity composition revealing the adaptation of this community to the oil contamination.43\n3INTRODUCTION44\nOil pollution represents a major threat to marine life and ecosystems, and with the world45\ndemand for oil increasing, it is likely to remain one of the biggest threats to the marine46\nenvironment for years to come. Consequently there is growing interest in reclaiming polluted47\nmarine and coastal sites by using oil-degrading bacteria (Head & Swannell, 1999).48\nMediterranean coastal regions are particularly exposed to oil pollution due to extensive49\nindustrialization and urbanisation and transport of crude and refined oil to and from refineries.50\nThe Etang de Berre, a brackish lagoon bordering the Mediterranean Sea in the South of51\nFrance, constitutes an important industrial area receiving seawater from the Gulf of Fos and52\nfreshwater from a few natural tributaries. For decades, the lagoon has received huge amounts53\nof hydrocarbons from refineries, petrochemical plants and transportation systems, in addition54\nto biogenic inputs (Jacquot et al., 1999). Despite efforts since the 1970s to reduce oil spills55\nand waste entering the lagoon by using water-treatment plants and retention basins, Etang de56\nBerre remains a heavily contaminated ecosystem.57\nThe fate of spilled oil in coastal ecosystems depends largely on a wide variety of58\nphysical, chemical and biological processes, among which biological degradation or59\nbioattenuation is the principal removal route (Leahy & Colwell, 1990). Recently, several60\nstudies have demonstrated the efficiency of estuarine and sediment oil-degrading microbial61\ncommunities in microcosms (Coulon et al., 2007; McKew et al., 2007; R\u00f6ling et al., 2002).62\nHowever, little information on the response in situ of the indigenous microbial communities is63\navailable (Macnaughton et al., 1999). This information is crucial to better understand the fate64\nof oil in marine systems and for the development of knowledge-based strategies to accelerate65\nthe ecological repair process.66\nIn oil-polluted marine intertidal flats and coastal lagoons, the development of microbial67\nmats dominated by cyanobacteria, colourless and purple sulphur bacteria and sulphate-68\n4reducing bacteria is frequently observed (Van Gemerden, 1993). We have described the69\nstructure of pristine hypersaline microbial mat communities of Salins-de-Giraud (Four\u00e7ans et70\nal., 2004), their dynamics (Four\u00e7ans et al., 2006) and their capacity to degrade crude oil when71\nmaintained in microcosms (Bordenave et al., 2004). Recently, we started to characterize72\nmicrobial mats developed in restricted oil input area suggesting the possible effects of73\npetroleum on microbial community composition (Hern\u00e1ndez-Raquet et al., 2006). To further74\ninvestigate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons on microbial community structure75\nand diversity and hence provide a better understanding of natural attenuation process in76\ncoastal environment, chemical, molecular and multivariate analyses were combined together.77\n78\nMATERIALS AND METHODS79\nSite and Sampling procedure. The Berre lagoon (France) has a long history of oil80\npollution, the north eastern area being described as the most contaminated of the lagoon,81\nparticularly in the ten upper centimetres of the sediments (Jacquot et al., 1999). Located in82\nthis area (43\u00b029\u201905\u2019\u2019N; 5\u00b011\u201917\u2019\u2019E), the retention basin studied collected hydrocarbon83\ncharged water from a petrochemical industry since several decades (Fig 1). Highly used up to84\nthe 70\u2019s, it remains chronically supplied with contaminated rainfall water that flow from the85\nindustry to the primary sedimentation tank and from the sedimentation tank to the retention86\nbasin by overflowing system.87\nSamples were collected in May 2006 from nine stations screening the waste input88\n(EDB1), the basin periphery (EDB2 to EDB8), and water out of the basin (EDB9) (Fig. 1).89\nThe station EDB1 is located in a restricted area limited by a floating barrier that retains the90\nfloating hydrocarbons. Water samples were first collected at the nine stations for hydrocarbon91\nanalysis. A thin beige mat of few millimetres cover the subsurface of black anoxic sediments.92\nThis mat and sub-surface sediments were sampled together, quickly homogenized and frozen93\n5in liquid nitrogen for both hydrocarbon and molecular analysis. Samples were stored at \u20138094\n\u00b0C until analysis.95\n96\nChemical analysis. Sediment samples (2 g) were chemically dried with 2 g of97\nanhydrous sodium sulphate (Na2SO4). Dried samples were extracted with 6 mL of98\nhexane:dichloromethane (1:1) by horizontal shaking at 150 oscillations per min over 16 h and99\nfinally sonicated for 30 min at 20 \u00b0C. After centrifugation (5897 g for 20 minutes), extracts100\nwere cleaned on Supelclean\u2122 solid phase extraction (SPE) tubes as recommended by the101\nmanufacturer (SPE Supelclean Envi\u2122-18, Supelco Bellefonte, USA). Extracts were diluted102\n10 times for gas chromatography analysis.103\nSeawater samples (40 mL), collected in glass vials washed in acid solution and rinsed with104\nhexane, were extracted using SPE tubes as recommended by the manufacturer (SPE105\nSupelclean Envi\u2122-18, Supelco Bellefonte, USA). After transfer of the water samples into the106\nSPE tubes, extracts were eluted with 5 mL of hexane: dichloromethane (1:1) and then107\nevaporated to 0.7 mL over an ice bath to minimize loss of semi-volatile low molecular weight108\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).109\nDeuterated alkanes (C10d22, C19d40 and C30d62) and PAH (naphthalened8, anthracened10,110\nchrysened12 and perylened12) internal standards were added to the extracts at 0.5 \u00b5g mL-1 and111\n0.4 \u00b5g mL-1, respectively. Aliphatic hydrocarbons and PAH were identified and quantified by112\nGC-MS using a Thermo Trace GC gas chromatograph coupled to a Thermo Trace DSQ\u00ae113\nmass spectrometer as described previously (Coulon et al., 2007).114\nFor quality control, a 2 ng \uf06dL-1 diesel standard solution (ASTM C12-C60 quantitative, Supelco)115\nand a 1 ng \uf06dL-1 PAH Mix Standard solution (Supelco) were analyzed every 15 samples. The116\nrecovery percentages of the extraction method used for sediment and seawater samples were117\n85% and 89%, respectively. The variation of the reproducibility of extraction and118\n6quantification of samples were determined by successive extractions and injections (n = 6) of119\nthe same sample and estimated to +\/- 8% in both cases.120\n121\nDNA extraction. Total genomic DNA extractions from environmental samples were122\nperformed in triplicate using the alternative lysis method of the UltraCleanTM Soil DNA123\nisolation kit (MOBIO Laboratories Inc., USA). The manufacturer\u2019s instructions were124\nfollowed except for the initial step of lysis where 500 \u00b5L of each sediment sample were125\nvortexed horizontally during 20 minutes. Then, purified DNA was suspended in 50 \u00b5L of126\nsterile water and examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. All extracted genomic DNA127\nsamples were stored at \u201320 \u00b0C until further processing.128\n129\nPCR and T-RFLP analysis. The fluorescently labelled primers used for PCR amplification130\nof bacterial 16S rRNA gene were TET 8F (5'-tetrachlorofluorescein phosphoramidite-131\nAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3') (Lane, 1991) and HEX 1489R (5'-hexachlorofluorescein132\nphosphoramidite-TACCTTGTTACGACTTCA-3') (Weisburg, 1991). PCR and T-RFLP133\nanalysis were carried out as described previously (Bruneel et al., 2006) using the Taq DNA134\npolymerase (Eurobio). The fluorescent PCR products were viewed on 1% w\/v agarose gels,135\ncleaned with PCR purification kit (GE Healthcare) and 10 \u00b5l of purified product digested136\nseparately with 3 U of enzyme HaeIII, HinfI or HpaII for 3 h at 37\u00b0C (New England Biolabs).137\n1 \u00b5l of restriction digests were then mixed with 20 \u00b5l of deionized formamide and 0,5 \u00b5l of a138\nTAMRA labelled Genescan 500 bp internal size standard (Applied Biosystems), denatured for139\n5 min at 95\u00b0C, and immediately transferred to ice. Triplicate samples were loaded onto an140\nABI PRISM 310 automated genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems). T-RFLP profiles were141\naligned by identifying and grouping homologous fragments, and normalized by calculating142\nrelative abundances of each T-RFs from height fluorescence intensity. Combining data from143\neach restriction enzyme, we compared normalized T-RFLP profiles. For statistical analysis,144\n7the averages of height of terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) detected in triplicates with145\neach endonuclease and each primer were used. In order to identify similarities between the146\nbacterial communities at the different sites, two-dimensional non-metric multidimensional147\nscaling ordination (2D-nMDS) based on presence\/absence transformation and Bray Curtis148\nsimilarity of all treated T-RFLP data were carried out with Primer6 (Plymouth Routines In149\nMultivariate Ecological Research, version 6.1.6). Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA)150\nwas performed to examine the influence of environmental variables (salinity, pH and151\nconductivity of water, hydrocarbon concentrations and distributions in water and sediment) on152\nthe structure of bacterial communities using MVSP software (Multi-Variate Statistical153\nPackage 3.12d, Kovach Computing Services, 1985-2001, UK).154\n155\nClone library. To characterize the bacterial populations inhabiting three stations of156\nthe retention basin (EDB1, EDB2, EDB3), 16S rRNA genes were amplified and cloned using157\nunlabeled 8F and 1489R primers. The PCR products were cloned in Escherichia coli158\nTOP10F\u2019 (Invitrogen) using the pCR2.1 Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Inc.). Cloned 16S159\nrRNA gene fragments were amplified using M13 primers surrounding the cloning site. Inserts160\nwere sequenced using the Big Dye\u00ae Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied161\nBiosystems). Sequences (about 1400 bp) were first analysed using the CHECK CHIMERA162\nprogram on the RDP Database Project website (http:\/\/rdp8.cme.msu.edu\/html\/) (Cole et al.,163\n2003). Then the sequences were compared with the GenBank nucleotide database library by164\nBLAST on-line searches (Altschul et al., 1997). Multiple sequence alignment of clones was165\nperformed by using CLUSTALX (Thompson et al., 1997) and PROcessor of SEQuences166\nv2.91 (Filatov, 2002). Phylogenies were constructed with the Molecular Evolutionary167\nGenetics Analysis v3.0 program (Kumar et al., 2004) using Kimura two parameters model168\nand Neighbour-joining algorithm. Significance of branching order was determined by169\n8bootstrap analysis with 1000 resampled data sets. PAST (PAleontological Statistics v1.60)170\nsoftware from http:\/\/folk.uio.no\/ohammer\/past\/ website was used to perform rarefaction171\nanalysis and calculate diversity indices for each clone library with clone phenotype similarity172\ndefined at 97% 16S rRNA sequence similarity. In order to determine the significance of173\ndifferences between the clone libraries, LIBSHUFF method was applied (Singleton et al.,174\n2001).175\n176\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The sequences determined in this study have177\nbeen submitted to the EMBL database and assigned Accession Nos. AM882511 to178\nAM882649.179\n180\nRESULTS181\nHydrocarbons distribution in the retention basin. Total extractable hydrocarbon182\ncontent (THC) in water and sediment samples ranged between 25 and 109 \u00b5g L-1 and between183\n42 and 286 mg kg-1, respectively (Fig. 2). About 70 compounds were found within the sub-184\nsurface sediment of the different stations sampled including 29 alkanes ranging from C10 to185\nC36, 38 PAHs and 3 conservative biomarkers, e.g. C30-hopane. Except EDB1 station where186\nTHC concentrations in sediment were lower than expected, the chemical analyses showed a187\nclear gradient of petroleum hydrocarbons contamination in water and sediment following the188\nbasin periphery from EDB2 to EDB8 (Fig. 2). THC in water from EDB8 were similar to those189\nfound in EDB9 showing the efficiency of this basin in hydrocarbon trapping, as well as the190\npossible influence of the lagoon water in the basin. For all stations, oil concentrations in191\nsediment were at least 1000 times higher than in water and hydrocarbon concentration192\nsediment\/water ratios were five-fold higher at EDB2 than at EDB7 or EDB8.193\n9The hydrocarbon composition in the different stations showed that alkanes represented194\n78 to 92% of the total hydrocarbon in water against 10 to 38% in sediment (data not shown).195\nConversely, PAHs represented 8 to 22% of total hydrocarbon concentration in water against196\n61 to 89% in sediment (data not shown). Alkyl-homologues of phenanthrene and pyrene were197\nrepresenting together more 80% of the PAHs within the sediment samples. Overall, the198\nhydrocarbon fingerprint analysis showed that THC concentration within the lagoon correlated199\nwith the distance from the inlet where sedimentation and accumulation of the hydrocarbons200\nwere clearly observed between the stations EDB2 and 8. Except to the station 8, the201\ndiagnostic weathering ratio \u2211chrysenes\/\u2211phenanthrenes was unchanged at all stations 202\nindicating that no weathering process was occurring within the sediment samples. However,203\nsignificant losses occurred in low molecular weight n-alkanes, as shown by the distribution204\nchange of nC17 and pristane concentration in station EDB1 and EDB2 (Fig. 3).205\n206\nBacterial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP fingerprinting. T-RFLP207\npatterns analysis (Fig. 4) showed eight different bacterial community structure forming three208\nclusters with similarity up than 66%: A grouping EDB1 to EDB4, B grouping EDB5 to209\nEDB7, and C including only EDB8 community. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)210\ncombining T-RFLP data and different environmental factors such as salinity, pH, conductivity211\nof water revealed no clear influence of these parameters in the bacterial community structure212\nof the samples (data not shown). Nevertheless, CCA analysis realised with T-RFLP data and213\nhydrocarbon concentrations in water and sediment indicated that water and sediment214\nhydrocarbon contents are the main measured variables that explain 32% of the bacterial215\ncommunity distribution (Fig. 5A). The pattern of bacterial communities structure from EDB2216\nto EDB8 followed the oil sediment concentration axis while the bacterial community structure217\nof EDB1 seemed to be influenced by others environmental factors as oil content in water. The218\n10\nimpact of oil content on the bacterial community structure assessment have already been219\nsuggested in coastal Mediterranean sediments of Lavera highly polluted by refinery effluents220\n(Mille et al., 1985).221\nWhen variables (T-RFs = OTUs operational Taxonomic Unit) were plotted on the CCA222\n(Fig. 5B), they fell into four clusters. Cluster 3 was related to the hydrocarbon distribution in223\nsediment (e.g. based on the alignment of variables along the THC sediment axis), and cluster224\n4 was probably influenced by others environmental factors. The OTUs of cluster 1 are all225\nspecific to the EDB1 station and represent 15% of the total diversity and 5% of relative226\nabundance of this sample. In the same way, the OTUs of cluster 2 are all specific to the EDB2227\nsite and represent about 4.5% of the total diversity of this sample and 1.2% of the relative228\nabundance.229\n230\nComposition of bacterial communities. Hydrocarbon distribution and concentration as231\nwell as bacterial community structure analysis showed that station EDB1 is particular and232\ndifferent from the rest of the stations. Thus phylogenetic analysis of 202 clones of 16S rRNA233\ngenes of the stations EDB1, EDB2 and EDB3 was performed in order to obtain a more234\nprecise picture of the bacterial community structure. The rarefaction analysis was performed235\nin order to determine if the number of clones analysed was representative of the diversity.236\nAlthough the curves did not reach a plateau (data not shown), the homologous curves237\nobtained by comparison of EDB1, EDB2 and EDB3 clone libraries with LIBSHUFF method238\n(data not shown) indicated that libraries are representatives of the most abundant populations239\nin the original communities (high homologous coverage at evolutionary distance up to 0.05).240\nThe comparison of the clone libraries with the LIBSHUFF method reveals also that 16S241\nrRNA gene sequences of EDB1 compared with those of EDB2 were composed of242\nsignificantly different phylotypes (XY12 p-value=0.010; YX12 p-value=0.323), while those of243\n11\nEDB2 and EDB3 libraries were not significantly different (XY23 p-value=0.928; YX23 p-244\nvalue=0.075). The Smith and Wilson eveness diversity index was 3.724, 3.628 and 3.707 for245\nEDB1, EDB2 and EDB3 respectively, indicating the same level of complexity of the three246\ncommunity stations despite the different and high concentrations of oil in these sediments.247\nThese bacterial communities appeared adapted to the environmental stress.248\nThe phylogenetic analysis of clone sequences obtained from the three libraries revealed249\ndominance of bacteria belonging to the Proteobacteria (Gamma-, Delta-, Alpha-, Epsilon-250\nand Betaproteobacteria), presence of bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes,251\nVerrucomicrobium, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and the presence of diatoms (Fig. 6 and252\nTable 1). All these sequences were closed related to those found either in coastal water,253\nseawater or in microbial mats, polluted or not with petroleum hydrocarbons (Abed et al., 2006254\n; Brakstad & L\u00f8deng, 2005 ; Coulon et al., 2007 ; Gentile et al., 2006 ; Van Gemerden,255\n1993). Approximately 1.5% of the sequences were affiliated with uncultured clones of256\nunclassified bacteria (candidate division JS1), 2.5% were defined as chimera and therefore257\nexcluded of all analysis.258\nClone sequences were mainly distributed in the Gamma- (37%) and259\nDeltaproteobacteria (33%), but in different proportions between the different sites (Fig. 6).260\nGammaproteobacteria represented 29% of EDB1 total sequences whereas they represented261\n42 and 41% in EDB2 and EDB3 respectively. Conversely, Deltaproteobacteria represented262\n40% of EDB1 sequences while they were estimated to 30 and 31% in EDB2 and EDB3263\nrespectively. Whatever the station, most of the acquired sequences from Gamma- and264\nDeltaproteobacteria were related to sulphur-oxidizing (Olavius algarvensis sulphur-oxidizing265\nendosymbiont, Thyasira flexuosa gill symbiont, Alkalispirillum mobile, Thiobaca spp.,266\nThiocapsa spp., Halochromatium spp. and Amoebobacter spp.) and sulphate-reducing267\nbacteria (Desulfobacterium, Desulfosarcina, Desulfococcus, Desulfotignum, Bacteriovorax268\n12\nand Anaeromyxobacter) (Fig. 7A-7B). Sequences related to oil-degrading sulphate-reducing269\nbacteria (Fig. 7B) and Spirochaeta smaragdinae isolates from oil-polluted systems (Table 1)270\nwere also found in the mat studied here. Few clone sequences related to well-known oil-271\ndegrading bacteria under aerobic condition such as Marinobacter spp. were found.272\n273\nDISCUSSION274\nChemical analysis of water and sediment of the basin indicated hydrocarbon concentrations275\nsimilar to those previously found in this site (Hern\u00e1ndez-Raquet et al., 2006) and comparable276\nto those found in well-established polluted environment like in the Arabian gulf coasts one277\nyear after the gulf war (20 to 369 mg kg-1 of dry sediment) (Al-Thukair, 2002), or those found278\nin the Prince William Sound (at historical industrial sites, i.e. not after the Exxon Valdez oil279\nspill; 1 to 151 mg kg-1 of PAHs) (Page et al., 2006). The alkane\/PAHs ratios in the basin280\nsediments are the converse of those previously found in the lagoon (Jacquot et al., 1999),281\nsuggesting a particular pollution of this basin different from the Berre lagoon pollution.282\nHydrocarbon compounds were widely accumulated in all sediment stations, particularly283\nPAHs. It is well known that hydrocarbons, particularly PAHs, have low aqueous solubility284\nand high solid-water distribution ratios, which prevent their utilization by planktonic bacteria285\nand promote their accumulation in the solid phase of the terrestrial environment (Johnsen et286\nal., 2005). However, the lower ratio of nC17\/pristane observed in sediment at EDB1 and287\nEDB2 stations suggested that alkanes biodegradation process occurred. Although the purpose288\nof this retention basin is to increase sedimentation of oil effluent in order to limit oil diffusion289\nand facilitate abiotic and biotic degradation, PAH weathering diagnostic ratio indicated that290\nno degradation was occurring. PAHs might be sorbed and sequestered within the sediment291\nand not exposed either to abiotic loss or microbial attack. It is well known that cyanobacterial292\nmat grow extensively building thick laminated mats on the oiled sediment surface and sealing293\n13\nthe surface (Barth 2003, Bordenave et al., 2007). This phenomenon is also observed in the294\nretention basin (Fig. 1C). Consequently, oil is trapped in an anaerobic milieu in which oil295\ntransformation can occur but at very slow rate (Garcia de Oteyza et Grimalt 2006). The296\nchemical analysis pointed also out that oil concentration in the sediment at EDB1 station was297\nlower than expected, while this station constituted the place of hydrocarbon input and was298\nlimited by a floating barrier supposed to prevent hydrocarbon scattering.299\nOil content of sediments of the retention basin provides an opportunity to300\ninvestigate how microbial communities differ along a hydrocarbon gradient in a coastal301\necosystem by T-RFLP analysis of 16S rRNA genes. Based on CCA, the amount of302\nhydrocarbon in the sediment has an effect on the microbial community structure. The303\nphylogenetic analysis of three analysed stations showed clones related to previously identified304\noil-related SRBs, Marinobacter spp. and others. However, the CCA explains only 32% of the305\ndata, others factors like fine sediment or organic matter carried out by the effluent are likely to306\nbe involved in the assessment of the bacterial community structure either if sedimentation of307\nthese kind of particles are supposed in the sedimentation tank (Fig. 1A). Previous study308\nconcerning bacterial composition of the station EDB1 using DGGE and ARISA showed309\nspecific microbial community associated to oil contamination level (Hernandez et al., 2006).310\nEnrichment culture of EDB1 sediment has permitted the identification of species involved in311\noil degradation (Hernandez et al., 2006; Ranchou-Peyruse et al., 2004) although this312\npopulations represent a minor fraction of the mat communities in the sediment of the Etang de313\nBerre retention basin (Hernandez et al., 2006). McKew et al. (2007) demonstrated in314\nmicrocosms experiment the quick activity of oil-degraders from environmental sample while315\nthese organisms could not be detected in their environment. Mazella et al. (2005) have316\nalready suggested that hydrocarbon-degraders able to degrade petroleum are present in low317\nproportion within the sediment. The impact of oil in the bacterial community structure is not318\n14\nonly associated to biodegradation (use oil as carbon source) but it can be associated to others319\nphenomena as toxicity, physical chemical changes, or others (Berge et al., 1987; Cochran et320\nal., 1998). Indeed, the sediments of the retention basin contain many other organic matter that321\ncan be used easier than oil as carbon source by bacteria.322\nBacteria populations associated to sulphur cycle has been found abundant as usually323\nin this kind of environments. Van Gemerden (1993) have already demonstrated the324\nimportance of colourless sulphur bacteria, purple sulphur bacteria and sulphate-reducing325\nbacteria in promoting oxygen and sulphide microgradients in mats. Oil pollution is well326\nknown to stimulate the sulphur cycle significantly (Kleikemper et al., 2002 ; Lovley, 1997).327\nDuring the last decade, studies have shown the potential of coastal marine sediment for328\nanaerobic hydrocarbon degradation under sulphate-reducing conditions (Coates et al., 1997 ;329\nTownsend et al., 2003 ; Widdel & Rabus, 2001). Moreover, with the exception of the330\nuppermost layer, the bulk of organic matter-rich marine sediments contaminated by petroleum331\nhydrocarbons are anoxic (Canfield, 1993). Sequences related to oil-degrading sulphate332\nreducing bacteria found in the mat studied here reinforced the possible role of these333\nmicroorganisms in anaerobic oil degradation. Indeed, in marine reduced sediments,334\nhydrocarbon degradation coupled to sulphate-reduction is considered as the most relevant335\nmetabolism among the different anaerobic processes (Rothermich et al., 2002).336\nIn conclusion the present study demonstrated a gradient of hydrocarbon contamination337\nin the retention basin and indicated that structure of the bacterial communities were correlated338\nwith the hydrocarbon contamination level. The oil pollution constitute therefore a selection339\npressure for these bacterial communities which seems furthermore well-adapted because of340\ntheir level of complexity. Nevertheless, this selection pressure doesn\u2019t induce increase of oil341\ndegrading bacteria as no obvious degradation process or many clones related to known-342\ndegrading bacteria were identified. The statement of a specific bacterial community structure343\n15\nassociated to low hydrocarbon concentration in EDB1 sediment station was clearly displayed.344\nThe role of this bacterial community in the unexpected low total hydrocarbon concentration345\nstation should be clarified.346\n347\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS348\nThis work was funded by the European Community Project FACEiT [(STREP- grant N\u00b0349\n018391 (GOCE)].
