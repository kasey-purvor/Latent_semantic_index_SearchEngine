Introduction \nAn adequate dietary supply of iron is essential both to maintain red blood cell production \nand for the normal function of a number of key metabolic enzymes.  Body iron is maintained \nprimarily by regulation of the absorption of dietary iron in the proximal small intestine (Sharp,  \nTandy, Yamaji, Tennant, Williams & Singh Srai, 2002; Sharp & Srai, 2007).  Dietary iron is \nfound in two basic forms, as haem or non-haem, in the form of iron oxides, salts or chelates.  \nNon-haem iron is the predominant form in most diets, but the bioavailability of this form is \nrelatively low (1-10%) (Sharp & Srai, 2007).  The uptake of dietary non-haem iron into the \ngastrointestinal (GI) tract requires protein-mediated transport, and two separate enterocyte \npathways have been identified, namely the Divalent Metal Transporter-1 (DMT1) and the \nIntegrin-Mobilferrin pathway (IMP) (Conrad & Umbreit, 2000; Conrad et al., 2000).  DMT1 \nrequires the iron to be in the ferrous form (Fe\n2+\n), and as a major proportion of dietary iron is in \nthe ferric form (Fe\n3+\n) it needs to be reduced prior to uptake by DMT1 in the enterocytes.  Several \nmechanisms are potentially available to reduce non-haem iron into the ferrous form.  The brush \nborder of duodenal enterocytes and cultured intestinal cells possess ferric reductase enzyme \nactivity (Dcytb) (Latunde-Dada,  Van der Westhuizen,  Vulpe,  Anderson, Simpson & Mckie, \n2002), and overexpression of Dcytb in intestinal cells has been shown to stimulate iron uptake \n(Latunde-Dada, Simpson & Mckie, 2008).  Non-haem iron can also be reduced by dietary factors, \nthe most important being ascorbate that can reduce ferric iron to the more absorbable ferrous \nform (Teucher, Olivares & Cori, 2004).  The presence of ascorbate has been previously shown to \nincrease iron uptake in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro (Han, Failla, Hill, Morris & Smith, \n1995; Kalgaonkar & Lonnerdal, 2008) and to increase the absorption of iron in human studies \n(Olivares, Pizarro, Pineda, Name, Hertrampf & Walter, 1997; Lopez & Martos, 2004; Moretti, \nZimmermann, Wegmuller, Walczyk, Zeder & Hurrell, 2006).  Following reduction, the Fe\n2+\n \nbecomes a substrate for DMT1 (Sharp & Srai, 2007).  In contrast to DMT1, the IMP pathway \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n3 \ntransports solely ferric iron, but not other metals of nutritional importance, and requires the \nchelation of ferric iron by mucins before interaction with 3-integrin and mobilferrin (Conrad & \nUmbreit, 2002; Sharp & Srai, 2007).    \nThe purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which \nascorbate enhances the uptake of ferric iron into the small intestine, using the Caco-2 cell model \nof human small intestinal enterocytes (Yamaji, Tennant, Tandy, Williams, Singh Srai & Sharp, \n2001).  We have used a kinetic approach and interpreted the results to show that ferric iron forms \na complex with ascorbate, which is subsequently transported into the cells by a DMT1-\nindependent mechanism.   \n \n \n2. Materials and methods \n \n2.1. Cell culture \nCaco-2 TC7 cells were maintained in 25-cm\n2\n plastic flasks.  The cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s \nModified Eagle Medium (DMEM) from GIBCO (Grand Island, NY), supplemented with 20% \nv\/v foetal calf serum (GIBCO), 1% v\/v non-essential amino acids (GIBCO), 1% antibiotic \nantimycotic (penicillin-steptomycin) solution (GIBCO) and 1% v\/v L-glutamine (Biowhittaker \nEurope; Verviers, Belgium).  The cells were maintained at 37 \u00baC in an incubator with 5% carbon \ndioxide (CO2), 95% air atmosphere at constant 95% relative humidity, and the medium replaced \nevery 2 days.  For iron uptake experiments, the cells were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells\/cm\n2\n \nin collagen-treated six-well plates (Costar Corp.; Cambridge, MA) and used at 21 days after \nseeding (Johnson, Yamaji, Tennant, Srai & Sharp, 2005). \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n4 \n2.2. Iron uptake studies  \nCaco-2 cells were transferred to serum-free medium for 24 hours before the start of experiments.  \nThe cells were washed by incubation with buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, \n10 mM MES, 0.5 mM of MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 pH 6.0) for 2 minutes at 37 \u00baC.  In order to \nmeasure iron uptake, 60 kBq of \n55\nFe(II) were added to each culture well and incubated for 15 \nminutes at 37 \u00baC.  Uptake was stopped by washing the cells three times with ice-cold buffer and \nthe cells were solubilised in 1 ml of 200 mM NaOH overnight (4 \u00baC).  Intracellular radioactivity \nwas determined by scintillation counting. \nThe data was fitted to a hyperbolic equation by non-linear regression (SigmaPlot, Systat \nSoftware Inc. San Jose): \nUptake = Vmax \u00d7 [FeCl3]\/(Km + [FeCl3]) \nwhere [FeCl3] is the concentration of substrate, Vmax is the calculated maximum velocity of the \nreaction and Km is the calculated Michaelis constant, an indicator of substrate affinity (Segel, \n1975). \n \n2.3. Cell viability assay  \nTo ensure that our iron and ascorbate treatments did not induce cytotoxicity which might in turn \ninfluence iron reduction and uptake, an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-\ndiphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to determine cell viability.  This assay measures \nthe cleavage of MTT to a formazan derivative by mitochondrial enzymes and there is a linear \nrelationship between the amount of formazan produced and the number of viable cells \n(Mosmann, 1983; Ferrari, Fornasiero & Isetta, 1990).  To each well of a 96-well culture plate \nwas added 10 \u00b5l MTT reagent and the plate was incubated for 3-4 hours (37 \u00baC), before the \naddition of 100 \u00b5l DMSO per well to solubilise the cells.  The absorbance of formazan product \nwas determined at 570 nm.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n5 \n \n2.4. Ferric reduction assay \nThe conversion of Fe\n3+\n to Fe\n2+\n in the absence or presence of ascorbate was measured \nspectrophotometrically by using a chromogenic ferrous iron chelator \n(bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid, BPDS) (Timmerman & Woods, 1999).  Uptake buffer (700 \n\u00b5l) containing various concentrations of Fe\n3+\n (0-30 \u00b5M) was added to a cell culture well \ncontaining 21-day post-confluence Caco-2 cultures and incubated for 15 minutes (37 \u00baC).  The \nbuffer was collected (4 \u00baC) and 500 \u00b5l of 2 mM BPDS added before incubation for 1 hour at 37 \n\u00baC.  The concentration of Fe(II)-BPDS complex was measured at 534 nm, using a FeCl2 standard \ncurve.  \n \n2.5. Statistics and data analysis \nKinetic parameters were determined by fitting the data to a hyperbolic curve by non-linear \nregression (Prism 5 for Windows, GraphPad Software Inc.).  Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni \npost-test was used to determine statistical significance (Prism 5 for Windows, GraphPad \nSoftware Inc.). \n \n \n3. Results and Discussion \nThe aim of this study was to kinetically investigate the uptake of non-haem iron by Caco-\n2 cells, and its promotion by ascorbate.  The uptake of FeCl3 across the apical membrane of \nCaco-2 cells has been well-documented to be a protein-mediated process, with several proteins \ncapable of playing the role of iron transporter (Garrick et al., 2006).  This observation was \nconfirmed by the saturable, hyperbolic nature of \n55\nFe(II) uptake (Fig. 1), with a calculated Vmax \nof 304 pmol\/h and Km of 13.2 \u00b5M.  A previous study showed that ferrous iron uptake by Caco-2 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n6 \ncells was also saturable, with a Km of 7 \u00b5M (Linder, Moriya, Whon, Kassa & Gilley, 2006), a \nvalue that is essentially identical to that obtained in our study (Fig. 1).  It has previously been \nshown that the reduction of ferric iron is required for uptake into Caco-2 cells (Han et al., 1995), \nand a potent enhancer of iron uptake is ascorbate (vitamin C) (Teucher, Olivares & Cori, 2004), \nwhich is capable of reducing ferric to ferrous iron (Johnson, Yamaji, Tennant, Srai & Sharp, \n2005).  In our studies the presence of ascorbate in the cell culture media significantly increased \nthe rate of iron uptake in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2; Table 1), and had no effect \non cell viability at concentrations up to 30 \u00b5M ascorbate (data not shown).   \nThe process by which ascorbate increases iron uptake has previously been ascribed to the \nreductive properties of ascorbate that increase the conversion of ferric to ferrous iron (Teucher et \nal., 2004), the latter then being a substrate for the membrane transporter DMT1 that is specific \nfor ferrous iron (Sharp et al., 2002; Sharp & Srai, 2007).  Indeed, it is believed that ascorbate \nsecreted in gastric juice is present to reduce dietary iron, preventing the formation of non-\nbioavailable ferric chelates (Atanasov, Li, Bjarnason, Tzatchev & Simpson, 2005).  If the \nreduction of ferric iron by ascorbate, or any other dietary reductant, was obligatory for the \nintestinal uptake of dietary ferric iron, then we should not observe a protein-mediated ferric iron \nuptake process.  As shown here (Figs. 1 and 2) and in other studies (Han et al., 1995), this is \nclearly not the case, as the Caco-2 cells take up a low, basal level of iron in the absence of \nascorbate.  One proposed mechanism to explain this observation involves the presence of a \nmembrane-bound ferric reductase, Dcytb, that can catalyse the reduction of ferric iron in the \nabsence of ascorbate, or other dietary reducing agents, to stimulate iron reduction and uptake \ninto Caco-2 cells (Yamaji et al., 2001; Latunde-Dada et al., 2002; Sharp & Srai, 2007; Latunde-\nDada et al., 2008).  However, the endogenous expression of Dcytb in Caco-2 cells is very low \n(Latunde-Dada et al., 2008). \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n7 \nAn alternative proposal is that ferric iron reduction is not essential and that there are \nseparate pathways for the uptake of ferric and ferrous iron (Han et al., 1995).  In order to \nseparate the processes of reduction and increased uptake, both of which could potentially be \ncatalysed by ascorbate, we determined ferric iron uptake rates and reduction under identical \nconditions (Fig. 3).  Both iron uptake (Fig. 3A) and ferric iron reduction (Fig. 3B) were \nsignificantly increased in the presence of ascorbate.  We surmised that if the promoting effect of \nascorbate on iron uptake was due only to its role as a reductant, then a comparison of \n55\nFe uptake \nvs. ferrous reduction should show a direct, linear correlation with a slope equal to one.  This was \nobserved in the absence of ascorbate, but there was a significant difference in the presence of \nascorbate (Fig. 3C).  This observation implies that a process distinct from iron reduction may \nexplain the promoting effect of ascorbate and therefore a kinetic approach was used to determine \nthe mechanism of rate enhancement observed with ascorbate.   \nPlots of \n55\nFe uptake rates (1\/v vs. 1\/[\n55\nFe]) in the presence of ascorbate display mixed-\ntype activation kinetics (Fig. 4) (Segel, 1975), with activation of \n55\nFe uptake by ascorbate being \nsaturable, as indicated by the finite Vmax obtained (Fig. 4 inset).  These observations are \ncharacteristic of a non-essential activator process (Segel, 1975) and indicate that ascorbate forms \na complex with ferric iron that is then taken up into the Caco-2 cells.  This finding implies that \nascorbate functions as a chelating agent of ferric iron and suggests that an iron-ascorbate \ncomplex enters the cells directly, although we cannot determine whether the iron in this complex \nis in the Fe\n3+\n or Fe\n2+ \nform.   \nTo further explore the kinetics of ascorbate-induced iron uptake we undertook similar \nexperiments in the presence of a known inhibitor.  Previous studies have shown that Zn\n2+\n inhibits \nthe intestinal uptake of iron (Yamaji et al., 2001; Han et al., 1995; Solomons, Pineda, Viteri & \nSandstead, 1983; Arredondo,  Martinez, Nunez, Ruz & Olivares, 2006; Conrad, Umbreit, Moore, \nUzel & Berry, 1994), but its effects are not mediated through DMT1 (Tandy et al., 2000; Garrick \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n8 \net al., 2003; Mackenzie, Takanaga, Hubert, Rolfs & Hediger, 2007).  We thus investigated the \ninhibitory effect of Zn\n2+ \non ferric iron\n \nuptake into Caco-2 cells, both in the absence and presence \nof ascorbate.  The results showed mixed-type (non-competitive) inhibition of iron uptake (Fig. 5), \nwith calculated Ki values of 141 and 236 \u00b5M Zn\n2+\n, in the absence and presence of ascorbate, \nrespectively.  The similarity of the inhibition constants (Ki) is interpreted to indicate that the \nsame protein complex is involved in ferric iron uptake across the apical membrane of Caco-2 \ncells.  As there is an unidentified transporter pathway for iron and zinc in Caco-2 cells that is not \nDMT1 (Yamaji et al., 2001) and DMT1 is specific for ferrous iron (Alonso-Vale et al., 2008), \nour findings would imply that DMT1 is not involved in the uptake of the iron-ascorbate complex.  \nThus, a different transporter system must be involved in the uptake of the iron-ascorbate \ncomplex and one possibility is that this complex interacts with IMP- 3-intergrin-mobilferrin \npathway, in a manner similar to that of Fe\n3+\n-mucin transport complex (Sharp & Srai, 2007), \nwhile other options include Zip14, a transporter of both iron and zinc in the duodenum, and the \nSVCT1 ascorbate transporter (Liuzzi, Aydemir, Nam, Knutson & Cousins, 2006; Wilson, 2005).   \nIn conclusion, this investigation provides evidence that ascorbate, in addition to its well-\ncharacterised reduction of ferric iron to provide a bioavailable supply of ferrous iron to DMT1, \nalso enhances directly the uptake of ferric iron into Caco-2 cells through the formation of an \niron-ascorbate complex.  DMT1 is not involved in the uptake of the iron-ascorbate complex and \nfurther work is required to identify the transporter system involved in the uptake of the iron-\nascorbate complex into intestinal enterocytes. \n \nAcknowledgements: Funding was provided for Aswir Abd Rashid by the Public Service \nDepartment of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. \n  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n9 \nReferences \nAlonso-Vale, M.I., Andreotti, S., Mukai, P.Y., Borges-Silva, C.N., Peres, S.B., Cipolla-Neto, J., \n& Lima, F.B.
