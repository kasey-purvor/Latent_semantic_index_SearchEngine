In\nSchizosaccharomyces pombe, the Chk1 kinase is essen-\ntial for mitotic arrest and is phosphorylated after DNA\ndamage. During S phase, the Cds1 kinase is activated\nin response to DNA damage and DNA replication\nblocks. The response of both Chk1 and Cds1 requires\nthe six \u2018checkpoint Rad\u2019 proteins (Rad1, Rad3, Rad9,\nRad17, Rad26 and Hus1). We demonstrate that DNA\ndamage-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 is also\ncell-cycle specific, occurring primarily in late S phase\nand G2, but not during M\/G1 or early S phase. We\nhave also isolated and characterized a temperature-\nsensitive allele of rad3. Rad3 functions differently\ndepending on which checkpoint pathway is activated.\nFollowing DNA damage, rad3 is required to initiate\nbut not maintain the Chk1 response. When DNA\nreplication is inhibited, rad3 is required for both\ninitiation and maintenance of the Cds1 response. We\nhave identified a strong genetic interaction between\nrad3 and cds1, and biochemical evidence shows a\nphysical interaction is possible between Rad3 and Cds1,\nand between Rad3 and Chk1 in vitro. Together, our\nresults highlight the cell-cycle specificity of the DNA\nstructure-dependent checkpoint response and identify\ndistinct roles for Rad3 in the different checkpoint\nresponses.\nKeywords: ATM\/ATR\/cell-cycle checkpoints\/Chk1\/Rad3\nIntroduction\nThroughout the cell cycle, checkpoint pathways monitor\nthe status of the DNA, and arrest cell-cycle progression in\nresponse to DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication\n(Hartwell and Weinert, 1989; Carr, 1995). The significance\nof the checkpoint response in maintaining genomic\nstability is highlighted by the evolutionary conservation\nof these pathways, as mammalian homologues of several\nyeast checkpoint genes, including those of rad1 (hRad1),\nrad3 (ATR\/ATM), rad9 (hRad9), rad17 (hRad17), hus1\n(hHus1) and chk1 (hChk1), have been identified. Pheno-\n\u00a9 European Molecular Biology Organization 7239\ntypes have only been identified for mammalian homo-\nlogues of the rad3 gene (Savitsky et al., 1995; Bentley\net al., 1996; Lieberman et al., 1996; Flaggs et al.,\n1997; Sanches et al., 1997; Cliby et al., 1998; Kostrub\net al., 1998).\nIn fission yeast, Rad3 is one of six checkpoint Rad\nproteins required for both the DNA damage and DNA\nreplication checkpoints (Bentley et al., 1996). However,\nthese pathways can be differentiated by varying degrees\nof dependency on Chk1 kinase, which functions in a\nRad3-dependent manner in response to DNA damage (Al-\nKhodairy et al., 1994; Ford et al., 1994; Walworth and\nBernards, 1996). chk1 null mutants are sensitive to DNA\ndamage but not hydroxyurea treatment. Consistent with\nthis, chk1 null cells are unable to delay mitotic entry after\nDNA damage, but arrest normally in hydroxyurea. Chk1\nis phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, although\nit is not known whether Chk1 phosphorylation corresponds\nto activation (Walworth and Bernards, 1996). Work in\nhuman cells suggests a model in which Chk1 targets the\ncell-cycle machinery by inhibiting the Cdc25 phosphatase\n(Peng et al., 1997; Sanches et al., 1997).\nThe Cds1 kinase is activated in response to both DNA\ndamage and DNA replication blocks only during S phase\n(Lindsay et al., 1998). Similar to Chk1 phosphorylation,\nthis response is dependent on the presence of the check-\npoint Rad proteins, including Rad3. Cds1 is required for\nthe delay of S phase progression in response to DNA\ndamage, and is also required for cells to tolerate replication\nblocks imposed by hydroxyurea. Although neither cds1\nor chk1 mutants show a clear mitotic arrest defect during\nincubation with hydroxyurea, a cds1 chk1 double mutant\nis unable to delay mitosis during treatment, and the cells\ndie with a classic \u2018cut\u2019 phenotype (Lindsay et al., 1998).\nChk1, which is not normally phosphorylated during\nhydroxyurea treatment, becomes phosphorylated during\nhydroxyurea treatment in cds1 null cells (Lindsay et al.,\n1998). This suggests that Cds1 and Chk1 are not simply\nfunctionally redundant, as has been suggested in a recent\nreport by Boddy et al. (1998), but that in the absence of\nthe Cds1 protein kinase, hydroxyurea causes DNA damage\nwhich is then capable of activating the Chk1 pathway. It\nis clear that Cds1 plays an important role in regulating\nDNA synthesis.\nThe observation that Cds1 activation is confined to\nS phase implies that the checkpoint response is regulated\nin a cell-cycle-dependent manner. Here we present evid-\nence that the Chk1 response is also cell-cycle specific.\nChk1 phosphorylation occurs during late S phase and G2\nin response to both UV and gamma irradiation. During\nG1\/early S phase and mitosis there is no significant change\nin the phosphorylation status of Chk1 in response to\ndamage. As anticipated, the activation of the DNA damage\ncheckpoint during S and G2 required the presence of rad3.\nR.G.Martinho et al.\nWe have also isolated and analysed a temperature-\nsensitive allele of rad3 (rad3ts). We find that rad3 function\nis different for the distinct checkpoint responses. After\nDNA damage, Rad3 is required to initiate mitotic arrest\nand phosphorylate Chk1. However, once initiated, these\nresponses are maintained independently of Rad3. In\nresponse to DNA replication blocks, Rad3 is required for\nboth initiation and maintenance of mitotic arrest and Cds1\nactivity. We have identified genetic interactions between\nrad3 and cds1. Together with biochemical data, which\ndemonstrate that Rad3 can both bind to and phosphorylate\nthe Cds1 and Chk1 kinases in vitro, these results suggest\nthat the link between Rad3 and the downstream kinases\nis direct. We discuss the possibility that these data reflect\nthe formation of different Rad3 protein complexes.\nResults\nCell-cycle specificity of Chk1 phosphorylation\nG2-delay in response to DNA damage requires the function\nof the Chk1 protein. Following DNA damage of asyn-\nchronous cells, Chk1 is phosphorylated and this modifica-\ntion can be detected as a decrease in mobility by\nSDS\u2013PAGE. In order to establish whether the DNA\ndamage checkpoint is regulated by the cell cycle, we\nsynchronized HA-epitope tagged chk1 cells (chk1::HA;\nWalworth and Bernards, 1996) using cdc10 and cdc25.\nWhen incubated at the restrictive temperature, cdc10 and\ncdc25 arrest in the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle,\nrespectively. When shifted back to the permissive temper-\nature, cells will re-enter the cell cycle synchronously.\nchk1::HA cells were also arrested in early S phase using a\nhydroxyurea block. These cells proceeded through S phase\nsynchronously when hydroxyurea was removed from the\nmedium. Irradiation with both gamma (250 Gy) and UV\n(100 J\/m2) of arrested cells, and of cells at specific time\npoints after release from arrest, showed that there was a\nsignificant increase in the amount of shifted (phosphoryl-\nated) Chk1 (compared with the total amount of non-shifted\nprotein) during late S phase and G2, but not during G1\/\nearly S phase or mitosis (Figure 1A and B). These results\nwere confirmed by irradiating (100 Gy) cdc1 chk1::HA\ncells that had been synchronized by elutriation (Figure\n1C). If Chk1 functions after irradiation in G1\/early S phase,\nthese results indicate that this is distinct from its function\nduring S phase and G2. To rule out the possibility that\nthe DNA content of the cells is responsible for these\nobservations, we analysed chk1::HA diploid cells. These\ncells behaved in a similar manner to the chk1::HA haploid\ncells after gamma irradiation (data not shown).\nIsolation and characterization of rad3ts mutant\nallele\nSchizosaccharomyces pombe rad3 is required for all DNA\nstructure-dependent checkpoints (Bentley et al., 1996). To\nunderstand the role of rad3 we isolated a temperature-\nsensitive allele of rad3 (rad3ts) by transforming a rad3\nnull strain (rad3.d) with a randomly mutagenized genomic\nrad3 plasmid. A total of 60 000 colonies were screened\nfor sensitivity to hydroxyurea at 35\u00b0C but not at 27\u00b0C.\nOne plasmid was chosen for further analysis. Gene replace-\nment of the rad3 deletion allele with the rad3ts allele\nconfirmed that rad3ts gene conferred a clearly defined\n7240\ntemperature-sensitive phenotype. Analysis of survival fol-\nlowing either UV or hydroxyurea treatment, plus analysis\nof the checkpoint response to gamma-irradiation and\nhydroxyurea treatment, revealed that the rad3ts strain\nbehaved like wild-type cells at the permissive temperature\n(27\u00b0C) but had a phenotype equivalent to the rad3 null\nmutant at the restrictive temperature (35\u00b0C) (Figure 2A\u2013\nC). Sequence analysis of the rad3ts plasmid revealed the\npresence of seven mutations, one of which was located at\na conserved residue within the C-terminal kinase domain,\nin close proximity to the ATP-binding pocket (A2217V)\n(Figure 2D). We have confirmed that the A2217V mutation\nresulted in a similar phenotype to rad3ts by repeating the\ngenomic integration using a rad3 sequence containing\nonly this point mutation (data not shown).\nAnalysis of rad3ts following DNA damage\nAlthough it is known that rad3 is required for the\nestablishment of the DNA damage checkpoint response\nand for Chk1 phosphorylation, the temporal requirements\nfor Rad3 are not known. When rad3ts cells were incubated\nat the restrictive temperature for 10 min prior to gamma\nor UV irradiation, cells behaved similarly to the rad3.d\nstrain, with a significant decrease in cell survival and\na complete absence of the DNA damage checkpoint\n(Figure 3A\u2013C). In contrast, when rad3ts cells were shifted\nto the restrictive temperature, 5 or 10 min after irradiation\nwith gamma or UV, the cells survived equally as well as\nwild-type cells and maintained a virtually intact checkpoint\nresponse (Figure 3A\u2013C). In addition, both cell survival\nand the damage checkpoint response (after UV and gamma\nirradiation) were similar in cells shifted to the restrictive\ntemperature at different time intervals following irradiation\n(Figure 3A\u2013C). These results suggest that rad3 is required\nto initiate the DNA damage checkpoint response, but that\nonce activated, the response is maintained independently\nof rad3.\nPhosphorylation of the Chk1 protein kinase\nIn wild-type cells there is a temporal correlation between\nmitotic delay and Chk1 phosphorylation, as determined\nby decreased mobility on SDS\u2013PAGE (Walworth and\nBernards, 1996). To investigate whether Chk1 phospho-\nrylation correlates with our visual analysis of the check-\npoint, we created a rad3ts strain containing the genomic\nchk1::HA locus described by Walworth and Bernards\n(1996). At the permissive temperature (27\u00b0C) for the\nrad3ts allele, a decrease in the mobility of Chk1 was\nobserved in response to gamma and UV irradiation,\nindicating that Chk1 was phosphorylated as a result of\ncheckpoint pathway activation (Figure 4; data not shown).\nAt the restrictive temperature (35\u00b0C), these modifications\nwere not observed (Figure 4; data not shown). If the\nrad3ts chk1::HA strain was shifted to the restrictive\ntemperature 10 min prior to irradiation, the Chk1 protein\nwas not modified (Figure 4; data not shown). In contrast,\nif the rad3ts chk1::HA cells were shifted to the restrictive\ntemperature 10 min after irradiation, Chk1 was modified\nto similar levels as seen in wild-type cells (Figure 4;\ndata not shown). These results are consistent with the\nphysiological observations, and show that rad3 is primarily\nrequired to initiate the DNA damage checkpoint response\nRad3\/Chk1 analysis defines checkpoint reponses\nFig. 1. Cell-cycle specificity of Chk1 phosphorylation. (A) cdc10 chk1::HA was arrested in G1 by incubating at the restrictive temperature for 4 h.\nAliquots were exposed to either ionising radiation (250 Gy) or UV (100 J\/m2). After 20 min recovery, cells were pelleted, and total protein extract\nwas prepared and analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blotting. chk1::HA cells were arrested in early S phase by incubation with 20 mM\nhydroxyurea for 3 h and released into cell cycle by removal of hydroxyurea with a wash with fresh medium. At t0 and at 30 min intervals after\nrelease from the cell-cycle block, aliquots were exposed to ionising radiation (250 Gy). After 20 min recovery, the total protein extracts were\nprepared and analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blotting. FACS analysis (right) at each timepoint shows the progress of bulk DNA synthesis.\n(B) cdc25 chk1::HA was synchronised in G2 by incubating at the restrictive temperature for 4 h. Cells were irradiated at 15 min intervals following\nrelease and, after 20 min recovery, total protein extracts were prepared and analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blotting. The cell-cycle stage of the\nculture was followed by Calcofluor and DAPI staining. A graph showing percentages of pre-mitotic (G2), mitotic (separating nuclei), septated and\npost-mitotic (binucleate, septated and post-septated) cells at each timepoint is shown on the right. (C) chk1::HA was synchronized in G2 by\nelutriation. Aliquots of cells were treated with ionising radiation (100 Gy) at 20 min intervals. Following 20 min recovery, total protein extracts were\nprepared and analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blotting. Cell-cycle progression was followed using Calcofluor and DAPI staining, and a graph of\nthe percentages of mitotic and septated cells at each timepoint is shown on the right.\nand that once the checkpoint has been activated, this\nresponse is largely maintained independently of rad3.\nAnalysis of rad3ts in response to replication blocks\nrad3 is required for the response to DNA replication\nblocks and for the activation of the Cds1 protein kinase\nduring S phase, in response to both DNA replication\nblocks and DNA damage (Lindsay et al., 1998). Analysis\nof the rad3ts strain indicated that at 27\u00b0C, survival of\nhydroxyurea exposure and activation of the replication\ncheckpoint was similar to wild-type cells, while at 35\u00b0C\nit was similar to rad3.d cells (Figure 2A). Interestingly,\nthe checkpoint response established by the rad3ts strain\nat the permissive temperature could not be maintained at\nthe restrictive temperature and cells entered a catastrophic\nmitosis in a synchronous manner following a temperature\nshift to 35\u00b0C (Figures 2C and 5). A 60 min delay\nwas observed between the time of temperature shift and\nsubsequent entry into mitosis. This was observed even\n7241\nwhen cells had been incubated at the permissive temper-\nature with hydroxyurea for a prolonged period.\nCds1 protein kinase activity\nCds1 activation is dependent on the \u2018checkpoint rad\u2019\ngenes. Cds1 is essential for the delay to S phase progression\nin response to DNA damage and is also essential for\ntolerance to replication blocks imposed by incubation with\nhydroxyurea (Murakami and Okayama, 1995; Lindsay\net al., 1998). To determine whether the loss of cell-cycle\narrest observed in rad3ts cultures shifted to the restrictive\ntemperature was related to the activity of the Cds1 protein\nkinase, we assayed for Cds1 protein kinase activity on the\nnon-physiological substrate, myelin basic protein (MBP).\nAfter shifting to the restrictive temperature, Cds1 protein\nkinase activity was reasonably high between 30 and\n60 min, but beyond this time a decay was observed and\nCds1 kinase activity was almost non-detectable\n(Figure 5B). Thus, there is a strong correlation between\nR.G.Martinho et al.\nFig. 2. Isolation and characterization of a rad3ts mutant.

(D) Sequence alignment of Rad3 and of Rad3-related proteins for the region containing the mutation\n(A2217V) which results in the rad3ts phenotype.\nthe decrease in Cds1 kinase activity and subsequent entry\ninto a catastrophic mitosis.\nTaken together these results suggest that rad3 is required\nto both initiate and maintain the checkpoint response to\nDNA replication blocks. The temporal correlation between\nthe decrease in Cds1 protein kinase activity and the\ntime which cells enter a catastrophic mitosis suggests a\nfunctional dependency.\nMulti-copy suppressor screen for rad3ts\nhydroxyurea survival\nThe creation of the rad3ts allele gave us a tool to identify\ngenes which genetically interacted with rad3. Screens\nwere initiated to identify multi-copy suppressors of the\nsensitivity of the rad3ts mutant to hydroxyurea at the\nsemi-permissive temperature (32\u00b0C). Of the 150 multi-\ncopy suppressors isolated, 40 were characterized as strong\nsuppressors of the rad3ts hydroxyurea sensitivity.\n7242\nSequence and Southern-blot analysis revealed that 36 of\nthese were plasmids containing the rnr3 gene, which\nencodes the catalytic subunit of ribonucleotide reductase\nand functions to maintain nucleotide pools. Given that\nhydroxyurea reduces nucleotide pools by inhibiting ribonu-\ncleotide reductase, it is perhaps not surprising that multiple\nclones of rnr3 were isolated. This presumably represents\na classic bypass of the requirement for rad3 function,\nsince cells do not elongate under these circumstances\n(data not shown).\nAnalysis of the remaining four strong suppressors\nidentified the cds1 gene. The genetic interaction between\nrad3 and cds1 was found to be specific to the rad3ts\nallele, and specific to the semi-permissive conditions at\nthe expression levels used (multi-copy genomic fragment\nunder its own promoter). cds1 was neither able to suppress\nthe hydroxyurea sensitivity of the rad3.d mutant (Figure\n6A) or the hydroxyurea sensitivity of the rad3ts mutant\nRad3\/Chk1 analysis defines checkpoint reponses\nFig. 3.

Asynchronous cells\nwere shifted from the permissive to the restrictive temperature for rad3ts either before (\u201320, \u201310 min) or after (10, 20, 40 and 120 min) treatment.\nPlates were incubated at the restrictive temperature for 3 days.

Analysis of survival to DNA damage of\nrad3ts and rad3 null cells over-expressing chk1 demon-\nstrated that chk1 was able to suppress the UV sensitivity\nof both the rad3ts and rad3.d mutants at the semi-\npermissive temperature for the rad3ts allele (Figure 6B).\nchk1 over-expression is known to delay the cell cycle\nindependently of rad3 (Ford et al., 1994) and even a\nmoderate cell-cycle delay has been previously shown to\n7243\npartially rescue survival of checkpoint rad mutants (Al-\nKhodairy and Carr, 1992). Thus, a genetic interaction, if\nit exists, might be masked by non-specific effects.\nRad3 interacts with Cds1 and Chk1\nTo explore the interactions identified between rad3 and\ncds1, and possibly between rad3 and chk1, we asked\nwhether the corresponding proteins interact biochemically.\nCo-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed\nusing a genomic myc-tagged allele of rad3 (described\nelsewhere) but neither Cds1 nor Chk1 proteins at wild-\ntype levels or when over-expressed using a plasmid-borne\nattenuated nmt1 promoter could be detected (IP of myc-\ntagged Rad3 requires cell lysis in mild detergent). How-\never, when glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Chk1\nor Cds1 were co-overexpressed with myc-tagged Rad3,\nRad3 was identified in both Chk1 and Cds1 precipitates\n(Figure 6C). When both HA-tagged Rad3 and myc-tagged\nChk1 were overexpressed in wild-type cells (we estimate\nthe level of over-expression to be ~10- to 15-fold), Chk1\nR.G.Martinho et al.\nFig. 4. Rad3 is required to initiate the DNA damage checkpoint. rad1 chk1::HA, rad3ts chk1::HA and rad3.d chk1::HA cells were irradiated at t0\nwith 250 Gy of ionizing radiation. Total protein was prepared from unirradiated control cells and from cells immediately after irradiation (t0) and at\n15 min intervals thereafter. The phosphorylation status of Chk1 was investigated by SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blot analysis. The experiment was\nperformed either at 27\u00b0C (permissive for rad3ts) or 35\u00b0C (restrictive for rad3ts), and separately with a temperature shift from 27 to 35\u00b0C either 10\nmin before or 10 min after irradiation.\nwas identified in Rad3 immunoprecipitates (Figure 6D).\nUnder equivalent conditions Cds1 was not identified in\nRad3 immunoprecipitates. These data suggest that Rad3\nmay interact with Cds1 and Chk1 in a transient manner\nwhich can only be detected by immunoprecipitation fol-\nlowing over-expression. To address whether Cds1 and\nRad3 are found in a common complex in the soluble\nmaterial (equivalent to that used for IP), we examined the\nsize distribution of these two proteins using Superdex 200\ncolumn chromatography. In soluble extracts, Rad3 and\nCds1 did not elute in common fractions (Figure 6F and\nG). We do not consider that the interactions detected when\nthe proteins are over-expressed are artefactual, since\ninteractions between Rad3 and several other checkpoint\nproteins such as Rad1 and Rad17 were not identified using\nequivalent conditions (data not shown).\nRad3 phosphorylates Cds1 and Chk1 in vitro\nGenetic suppression of the rad3.ts mutant strain by cds1\nsuggests that the kinase encoded by this gene is able\nto amplify the presumably weakened checkpoint signal\ntransmitted by the defective form of the Rad3 protein,\nand therefore maintain the checkpoint response. In addition\nto the genetic interaction, Rad3-dependent activation\n(Cds1) and modification (Cds1 and Chk1) suggest that\nthese kinases may be substrates for Rad3. The potential\nfor interactions identified between Rad3\u2013Cds1 and Rad3\u2013\nChk1 would be consistent with a kinase\u2013substrate relation-\nship between Rad3 and these downstream kinases. To\ninvestigate this we tested kinase dead (KD) Cds1 and\nChk1 as in vitro substrates for Rad3, immunoprecipitated\nfrom cells overexpressing rad3. Although the Rad3 protein\nhas relatively weak in vitro kinase activity and does not\nphosphorylate a number of non-physiological substrates\n(Bentley et al., 1996), immunoprecipitated Rad3 was\nshown to phosphorylate Cds1-KD and Chk1-KD substrates\n(Figure 6E). Control experiments using immunoprecipi-\ntated Rad3.KD indicate that Cds1 and Chk1 phosphoryla-\ntion was dependent on the integrity of the Rad3 kinase.\nIn these assays Chk1 is not converted to a lower mobility\n7244\nform. This may be because a kinase dead form of Chk1\nwas used and it has been reported that Chk1 kinase activity\nis required to see the mobility change (Walworth and\nBernards, 1996). These results show that the Rad3 kinase\nis capable of phosphorylating both Cds1 and Chk1 protein\nkinases in vitro, although it does not establish that they\nare direct targets in vivo. The inability to detect Rad3\nkinase activity using a variety of non-physiological sub-\nstrates, such as MBP, lends support to a biological signi-\nficance for the phosphorylation of Cds1 and Chk1 by\nRad3. Further analysis to establish whether or not this\nphosphorylation resulted in the activation of Cds1 and\nChk1 by Rad3 proved inconclusive. This might be\nexpected, given the complexity of the checkpoint response\nand that additional factors may be required for the activa-\ntion of Rad3 substrates, which were not present in the\nin vitro conditions used.\nDiscussion\nTwo main points emerge from our analysis of Rad3 and\nChk1: first, the response of Chk1 to DNA damage is\nspecific to the later stages of the cell cycle (post DNA\nreplication). Secondly, the function of Rad3 in activating\nthe Cds1 (S phase specific) and Chk1 (late S\/G2 phase\nspecific) responses is distinct. For the Chk1 response,\nRad3 is required to initiate but not to maintain mitotic\ndelay. For the Cds1 response, Rad3 is required for both\ninitiation and maintenance. We also present genetic and\nbiochemical data that are consistent with a direct inter-\naction between Rad3 and these two downstream kinases.\nCell-cycle specificity of checkpoint responses\nThe chk1 null mutant is sensitive to DNA damaging agents\nand is unable to delay mitotic entry in response to DNA\ndamage (Walworth et al., 1993; Al-Khodairy et al., 1994).\nChk1 is phosphorylated after DNA damage, and there is\na temporal correlation between Chk1 phosphorylation and\nthe activation of the checkpoint response. Analysis in\nhuman cells suggests Chk1 prevents entry into mitosis\nRad3\/Chk1 analysis defines checkpoint reponses\nFig. 5. The role of rad3 in response to replication blocks. (A) Wild-type, rad3.d and rad3ts cells were synchronized in G2 using lactose gradients,\nand released into medium containing 20 mM hydroxyurea at the permissive temperature (27\u00b0C). At specific time intervals an aliquot of cells were\nremoved and shifted to the restrictive temperature (35\u00b0C). Cell-cycle progression was monitored at regular intervals by fluorescent microscopy after\nstaining with Calcofluor and DAPI. Septation index is shown. Note that some of the results shown form part of Figure 1 and are shown here for\nclarity. (B) Release of cell-cycle arrest correlates with a decrease in Cds1 kinase activity. An asynchronous culture of rad3ts cells was synchronized\nin S phase by incubation in 20 mM hydroxyurea for 3 h at the permissive temperature (27\u00b0C). The culture was divided into two; one half remained\nat 27\u00b0C while the other half was shifted to 35\u00b0C (restrictive for rad3ts). Left panel: at 30 min intervals, cell-cycle progression was monitored by\nDAPI and Calcofluor staining. Right panel: at 30 min intervals, 10 ml samples were taken, protein extracts prepared and IP kinase activity for Cds1\nwas measured using MBP.\nfollowing DNA damage by targeting the cell-cycle\nmachinery through inhibition of the Cdc25 phosphatase\n(Sanches et al., 1997). This is consistent with data from\nS.pombe (Furnari et al., 1997), although it has also been\nreported that Wee1 is a downstream target of Chk1\n(O\u2019Connell et al., 1997). The precise nature of the inter-\nactions between Chk1 and the cell-cycle machinery thus\nawaits identification of the in vivo targets.\nOur data provide evidence that activation of the DNA\ndamage checkpoint is cell-cycle specific. Chk1 is phos-\nphorylated in response to damage during late S phase and\nG2. During G1\/early S phase and mitosis there was no\nsignificant modification of Chk1 in comparison with the\ntotal amount of non-shifted Chk1 protein. chk1::HA diploid\ncultures had a similar Chk1 phosphorylation profile in\nresponse to both UV and gamma irradiation, indicating\nthat the cell-cycle specificity identified for the DNA\ndamage checkpoint is not caused simply by the DNA\ncontent of the cell. It is known that the Chk1 protein\nkinase is required to prevent catastrophic mitosis in cdc10\narrested cells (G1 phase cells), which suggested a role for\nthe Chk1 protein kinase in G1 (Carr et al., 1995). From\nour data it is clear that if the Chk1 protein kinase performs\ndifferent roles (or performs the same role in a different\n7245\nmanner) during specific stages of the cell cycle, the onset\nof S phase and the beginning of DNA replication are\nrequired for the switch from the G1-form of response\nto the G2-form of response, which is seen following\nDNA damage.\nInterestingly, a very weak modification of Chk1 protein\nin non-irradiated cells can be seen at t30 and t60 (S phase),\nbut not at t0, t90 and t120 after the release of the hydroxyurea\nblock. This suggests that problems are caused by incuba-\ntion of cells in hydroxyurea, but that these only cause\nmodification of the Chk1 protein kinase once cells progress\nthrough S phase.\nCell-cycle- and checkpoint-specific roles of Rad3\nCharacterization of the rad3ts mutant showed a null\nphenotype at the restrictive temperature (35\u00b0C) and a\nwild-type phenotype at the permissive temperature (27\u00b0C).\nWe have used this allele to investigate the temporal\nrequirement for rad3 in the checkpoint responses. rad3 is\nprimarily required to initiate the DNA damage checkpoint.\nOnce activated, this checkpoint is maintained largely\nindependently of rad3. When the rad3ts strain was incub-\nated at the restrictive temperature 10 min prior to UV or\ngamma irradiation, the DNA damage checkpoint was\nR.G.Martinho et al.\nFig. 6.

When the rad3ts strain was\nshifted to the restrictive temperature, 5 or 10 min after\nirradiation, the cells behaved in a similar manner to wild-\ntype cells.\nThe difference in phenotypes between cells shifted to\nthe restrictive temperature 10 min before or 10 min after\nUV and gamma irradiation, and the fact that cells shifted\nto the restrictive temperature at different time points post-\nirradiation show a similar survival and duration of cell-\ncycle arrest, indicates that the Rad3ts protein is not\nsimply being inactivated slowly. The similar response of\na temperature-sensitive allele of another DNA damage\ncheckpoint gene, rad4\/cut5 (unpublished data; McFarlane\net al., 1997), suggests that these results reflect the overall\norganization of the DNA damage checkpoint and are not\ncaused by an unusual feature of the rad3ts allele itself.\nIn contrast to the DNA damage checkpoint role, Rad3\nis required to both activate and maintain the response to\nreplication blocks. When rad3ts cells were incubated with\nhydroxyurea at the permissive temperature (27\u00b0C), the\ncheckpoint response activated could not be maintained\nwhen cells were shifted to the restrictive temperature\n7246\n(35\u00b0C). The synchronous entry into mitosis observed at\nthe restrictive temperature suggests that the Rad3ts protein\nis not slowly inactivated. Interestingly, a 60 min delay\nwas observed between the shift to the restrictive temper-\nature and entry into mitosis. The kinetics of this delay\ncorrelated with a decrease of Cds1 protein kinase activity,\nwhich was observed between 30 and 60 min.\nThe cds1 gene was isolated four times from a screen\nfor multi-copy suppressors of the hydroxyurea sensitivity\nof rad3ts cells at the semi-permissive temperature (32\u00b0C).\nThis suppression was specific to the rad3ts allele and did\nnot occur at the restrictive temperature, suggesting a close\nassociation between rad3 and cds1. Attempts were made\nto detect a physical interaction between these two proteins\nat physiological levels. These demonstrated that Rad3 and\nCds1 are not associated in soluble extracts. However,\nunder conditions in which both Cds1 and Rad3 were\nmoderately overexpressed (we estimate ~10- to 15-fold\nover wild-type levels), Rad3 was reproducibly found in\nCds1 precipitates. Furthermore, Rad3 could phosphorylate\nCds1 in vitro. Together, these data indicate that Rad3 is\ncapable of forming a kinase\u2013substrate interaction with\nCds1, and that the connection between these kinases is\nRad3\/Chk1 analysis defines checkpoint reponses\nTable I.

It should\nalso be remembered that co-precipitation and co-size\nfractionation experiments only address the state of inter-\nactions in soluble material. It remains possible that a\nweak but temporally long-lasting interaction may occur\nin conjunction with DNA and DNA associated proteins\nthat is not accessible to such techniques.\nUsing similar genetic and biochemical tools, we also\nasked whether Chk1 and Rad3 could associate. When\noverexpressed, the chk1 gene is able to partially suppress\nthe UV sensitivity of the rad3ts mutant at the restrictive\ntemperature. Yet, since chk1 is also able to suppress the\nUV sensitivity of the rad3 null mutant to equivalent levels\nas the rad3ts allele, the specificity of this suppression is\nunclear, especially when it is considered that chk1 over-\nexpression delays cell-cycle progression independently of\nrad3 (Ford et al., 1994). The over-expression of chk1 and\nrad3 in wild-type cells, and subsequent precipitation of\nthe Chk1 protein with Rad3 and vice versa, supported\nan interaction between Rad3 and Chk1, although this\ninteraction did not occur at physiological levels of protein.\nRad3 was able to phosphorylate Chk1 in vitro. Combined\nwith the genetic data available, this suggests a direct link\nbetween Rad3 and Chk1.\nA model for the cell-cycle specificity of checkpoint\nresponses\nCds1 activation is S phase specific and Chk1 phosphoryla-\ntion is late S\/G2-phase specific. The role of Rad3 in these\ntwo events is also distinct. Since the Rad3 protein is\nrequired for all DNA structure dependent checkpoint\nresponses, a model that could account for the cell-cycle\nspecificity would be the formation and\/or utilization of\ndifferent populations of Rad3 protein complexes during\nthe cell cycle. At different stages of the cycle, Rad3 could\nbe associated with different proteins (e.g. Cds1 and Chk1)\nand these might modulate its function.\nThe different temporal requirements for Rad3 in the\nChk1 and Cds1 responses probably reflects the different\nfunctions of the two checkpoints. DNA damage appears\nto be rapidly recognized by the checkpoint machinery and\nsignalled to Chk1, which then maintains the checkpoint\nfor a period of time consistent with the phosphorylation\nstatus of Chk1. Thus, Chk1 dephosphorylation may be\nthe key event in determining the duration of the delay.\nSuch a model would define a period for repair which\nwould be based on the initial intensity of the damage. In\nthis way, the damage checkpoint would be independent\nof the DNA or DNA\u2013protein structures which are gener-\n7247\nated by subsequent repair. Unlike the damage checkpoint,\nwhich is a response to sudden events, the DNA replication\ncheckpoint monitors an ongoing process. The associated\nDNA and DNA protein structures would therefore be\npersistent. The replication checkpoint would be expected\nto respond to release from the replication block quite\nrapidly. Thus, the constant requirement for Rad3 is consist-\nent with the continuous monitoring of a stable structure\nuntil the situation is resolved.\nConclusion\nIn humans, different complexes are likely to be required\nduring different stages of the cell cycle. The two Rad3\nrelated proteins ATM and ATR appear to share responsibil-\nity for the DNA structure checkpoints (Savitsky et al.,\n1995; Cliby et al., 1998). ATR and ATM complexes\nmight be expected to monitor a number of distinct DNA\nstructures, and the occurrence of these protein complexes\nmight be associated with passage through G1, S and G2\nphases of the cell cycle. Our analysis of the different modes\nof action for Rad3 in fission yeast and the differential\nphosphorylation of Chk1 during the cell cycle may there-\nfore help to provide insight into the cellular mechanisms\nthat maintain genomic integrity in humans.\nMaterials and methods\nStrains\nThe strains used in this study are listed in Table I.\nGenetic and cell biology techniques\nDouble mutants were created by standard genetic techniques (Gutz et al.,\n1974). Cell survival analysis and checkpoint measurements following\nDNA damage and replication blocks were performed using methods\ndescribed previously (Al-Khodairy et al., 1994). Cells were synchronized\nin G2 using centrifugal force [lactose gradients or elutriation (Edwards\nand Carr, 1997)], or a 4 h temperature shift from 27 to 35\u00b0C of the\ntemperature-sensitive mutant strain cdc25.22. Cells were synchronized\nin G1\/S phase by either a 4 h temperature shift from 27 to 35\u00b0C of\nthe temperature-sensitive mutant strain cdc10.129, or by hydroxyurea-\ninduced DNA replication block (20 mM) and release by washing cells\nin fresh medium.\nWe noticed that, possibly due to the centrifugal stress cells suffer\nduring the elutriation procedure, there is a decrease of the total amount\nof Chk1 protein in the first two time-points after harvesting (this effect\nappears to be reproducible), and that a high degree of synchrony is\nrequired to detect a clear absence of Chk1 protein modification after\nDNA damage during mitosis and G1\/early S phase because these periods\nare relatively short.\nIsolation of a thermosensitive allele of rad3\nThe complete rad3 gene, cloned as a SacI\u2013PstI fragment in the leucine\nselectable expression vector pAL, was mutagenized with hydroxylamine\nR.G.Martinho et al.\n(Humphreys et al., 1976). Mutagenized plasmids were transformed into\nrad3.d and the resulting colonies selected on medium lacking leucine.\nTo identify thermosensitive alleles of the rad3 gene, 60 000 colonies\nwere screened by replica plating onto plates containing either 7.5 or\n10 mM hydroxyurea at both 27\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C, respectively (Martinho and\nCarr, 1998). Twenty colonies which were able to grow at 27\u00b0C, which\npossessed an elongated cellular phenotype and which died at 35\u00b0C with\na \u2018cut\u2019 phenotype were selected. Further characterization yielded a single\ncolony with a well-defined phenotype under these conditions. To generate\na rad3ts strain, the plasmid from this colony was isolated and the SacI\u2013\nPstI fragment encoding the mutagenized rad3 gene transformed into the\nrad3.d using FOA selection (Grimm et al., 1988). Genomic integration\nand replacement of the ura41 marker in the rad3.d strain by the mutated\nrad3 clone was confirmed by Southern blotting. Sequence analysis was\nused to identify the mutations present in the rad3 clone. The causative\nmutation of the temperature-sensitive phenotype (A2217V) was con-\nfirmed by genomic integration.\nIsolation of multi-copy suppressors of rad3ts\nUnless stated otherwise, the semi-permissive temperature used was 32\u00b0C\nand the restrictive temperature 35\u00b0C. The rad3ts strain was transformed\nwith the pURSP1 and pURSP2 S.pombe genomic libraries (Barbet et al.,\n1992), and 50 000 colonies were screened by replica plating onto plates\ncontaining 4, 5 and 7.5 mM hydroxyurea at both the semi-permissive\nand restrictive temperature, respectively (Martinho and Carr, 1998).\nApproximately 150 colonies, which were able to grow at the semi-\npermissive temperature but not at the restrictive temperature in the\npresence of hydroxyurea, were isolated and characterized further. To\nidentify the suppressers of the rad3ts hydroxyurea sensitivity, the library\nplasmids from these clones were recovered and analysed by restriction,\nSouthern blot and sequence analyses. Analysis revealed multiple isolates\nof the rnr3 gene and the isolation of four cds1 clones. To characterize\nfurther cds1 suppression, cds1 under the control of its own promoter or\nthe inducible nmt1 promoter, was transformed into both the rad3ts and\nrad3.d strains. The resulting transformants were serially diluted (107\u2013\n104 cells\/ml) and 2 \u00b5l were spotted onto plates with or without\nhydroxyurea (7.5 mM); plates were then incubated at the semi-permissive\ntemperature. To analyse the suppression of rad3 by chk1, the chk1 gene\nunder the control of the inducible nmt1 promoter (Rep41) was transformed\ninto both the rad3ts and rad3.d strains, which were assayed for survival\nwith increasing doses of UV radiation (Edwards and Carr, 1997).\nCds1 kinase assays\nProtein extraction and Cds1 kinase assays were performed as previously\ndescribed (Lindsay et al., 1998). One milligram of total protein was\nimmunoprecipitated using an affinity purified Cds1 kinase polyclonal\nantibody and protein A beads. The beads were washed three times with\nkinase buffer prior to incubation with 5 \u00b5l myelin basic protein (1 mg\/\nml of stock), 1 \u00b5l 2 mM ATP and 5 \u00b5Ci [\u03b3-32P]ATP (ICN) at 30\u00b0C for\n15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 \u00b5l of 23 sodium\ndodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, and Cds1 kinase activity was\nanalysed by SDS\u2013PAGE.\nImmunoprecipitation with Rad3\nWild-type cells were transformed with either Rep1GSTcds1 or\nRep1GSTchk1 and myc-tagged rad3, or with Rep41 and\/or Rep42\nplasmids (enabled nmt1 inducible expression) containing HA-tagged\nrad3 or myc-tagged chk1, respectively (Griffiths et al., 1995; Bentley\net al., 1996). The tagged proteins were expressed by growing in media\nlacking thiamine for 18 h (Maundrell, 1990). Yeast cells were lysed and\n1 mg total protein was immunoprecipitated using appropriate antibodies,\nas described previously (Bentley et al., 1996). The immunoprecipitates\nwere run on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Anti c-Myc (PharMingen) and\nanti-HA (Babco) antibodies, at dilutions of 1:1000, were used to probe\nthe subsequent Western blots. Chemiluminescent detection of horse\nradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies was carried\nout using ECL (Amersham).\nSize fractionation\nExtracts were prepared from a strain containing the rad3 gene tagged at\nthe genomic locus with the myc epitope as follows: mid-log phase cells\nwere harvested, washed in ice-cold water, washed again in ice-cold\nbuffer B (50 mM NaH2PO4 \/Na2HPO4 pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%\nNP-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 mM EGTA, 60 mM \u03b2-glycero-\nphosphate, 0.1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na-orthovanadate) and resuspended in\n1 ml buffer B plus protease inhibitors (BCL complete protease inhibitor\ncocktail). Cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine\n7248\npowder using a mortar and pestle. Thawed powder was cleared by\ncentrifugation (14 K in a microfuge 23 5 min) and 200 \u00b5l of supernatant\nloaded onto a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia HR10\/30). Fractions\n(0.5 ml) were collected and aliquots analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE and\nWestern blotting with anti-Myc monoclonal or anti-Cds1 serum (Lindsay\net al., 1998).\nKinase assays with Rad3\nrad3.d was transformed with the nmt1 inducible expression vector\ncontaining either Rep41HA-rad3 or Rep41HA-rad3.KD, and the corres-\nponding tagged proteins were induced in medium lacking thiamine.\nProtein extracts were prepared as described previously and 1 mg total\nprotein immunoprecipitated with 1 ug anti-HA antibody (Babco).\nKD mutations were introduced into the cds1 and chk1 genes by site-\ndirected mutagenesis. A D318E mutation was introduced into the cds1\ngene using the oligonucleotide GCCAAGCCAAATTCAGATATTTTAA-\nGATGG, and a D155E mutation introduced into the chk1 gene using\nthe oligonucleotide AGATGCAAAGCCGAATTCTGAAATCTTTAAG.\nBoth mutations disrupt the conserved DFG motif in the kinase domain.\nThe mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Cds1.KD and\nChk1.KD protein kinase substrates were prepared by transforming cds1.d\nand chk1.d mutant strains with inducible plasmids containing GST-tagged\ncds1.KD and chk1.KD genes, Rep1GSTcds1.KD and Rep1GSTchk1.KD,\nrespectively. GST-fusion proteins were expressed by growing in medium\nlacking thiamine for 18 h. The cells were disrupted in GST buffer\n(50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 80 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 250 mM NaCl, 15 mM\nnitrophenylphosphate, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1%\nNP-40 and supplemented with protease inhibitors, AEBSF, leupeptin,\naprotinin, pepstatin, bestatin, and E-64, all at 10 \u00b5g\/ml final concentration)\nwith glass beads (BDH) using a mikrodismembranator (Braun) for 33\n1 min at 2000 r.p.m. Protein extracts were cleared in a microfuge at\n14 000 r.p.m. for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. 1 mg total protein was mixed with\nglutathione\u2013agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, the beads were washed\n(34) with GST buffer at 4\u00b0C, and the bound GST fusion proteins eluted\nin batch with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 10 mM glutathione. The\neluates were analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE and then frozen as aliquots in\nliquid nitrogen.\nRad3 or Rad3.KD proteins were immunoprecipitated as described\nabove. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once\nwith kinase buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 75 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2,\n0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). Twenty microlitres of bead slurry was\nincubated with 10 \u00b5l 23 kinase buffer, 5 \u00b5l substrate and 10 \u00b5Ci of [\u03b3-\n32P]ATP (ICN) at 30\u00b0C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the\naddition of 20 \u00b5l 23 SDS sample buffer and samples were analysed by\nSDS\u2013PAGE.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Thomas Caspari for interesting and helpful\ndiscussions, and Thomas Caspari and Alan Lehman for critical reading\nof this manuscript.
