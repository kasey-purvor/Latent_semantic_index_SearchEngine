Introduction\nMicrochip or microreaction technology has been the focus of much attention in recent years [1]. \nVarious kinds of effective chemical processes have been successfully integrated into microchips to \nrealise  micrototal  analysis  (\u00b5TAS)  microreactors  and  lab-on-a-chip  systems  [2,3,4].  Controlled \nlaminar flows in microfluidic devices have been utilised to great benefit in a number of industrial \napplications including diffusion-based separation and detection [5], solvent extraction [6], mixing \n[7] and hydrodynamic focusing [8].\nIn  1999,  Kenis  et  al.  [9]  proposed  multiphase  laminar  flow  patterning  -  a  method  of \nmicrofabrication based on multicomponent laminar flow inside microchannels. The core idea of the \nmethod was to utilise laminar streams of aqueous solutions carrying desired reagents in order to \nestablish a  reaction at  the interface  between the streams.   This  approach not  only provided the \nadvantage of containing the reaction in a controlled thin zone but also allowed modification of the \ngeometry of this reaction zone. The resulting reactions produced various microstructures such as \ncontinuous  silver  wires,  used  as  reference  electrodes,  deposited  polymeric  structures  and  self-\nassembled monolayers.\nUse of this concept and exploitation of multiphase flow using liquids of the same or similar \nnature,  especially  aqueous\/aqueous,  for  analytical  or  fabrication purposes  have  been extensively \ndiscussed  [9-11].  However,  flow  control  of  solvents  with  distinct  properties,  notably \naqueous\/organic, for such applications have only recently been reported. Hisamoto et al. [12-15] \nsuccessfully  demonstrated  that  highly  efficient  molecular  transport  between  two  phases  for \nanalytical and synthetic applications was achievable using such aqueous\/organic multilayer flows; \nhere the organic solvents used included butyl acetate and dichloroethane. Such reactions exploited \nthe characteristics of the liquid microspace whereby short molecular diffusion distances and large \nspecific  interfacial  areas  could  be  realised.  Based  on  these  results,  they  advanced  an  approach \n2\nspecifically for fabricating nylon 6,6 membranes using two immiscible laminar flows, respectively \nof  adipoyl  chloride  in  dichloroethane  and hexamethylenediamine  in  aqueous solution  [15].  The \nmembranes were observed by SEM and characterised by gas permeation of ammonia. Zhao et al. \n[16]  also  reported  similar  nylon membrane formation inside  millimetre-sized fluidic  devices  by \nusing countercurrent flows of hexamethylenediamine in aqueous solution and adipoyl chloride in \nxylenes. The resulting nylon membranes were produced by an interfacial polycondensation reaction \n(Fig. 1).\nFig. 1. The scheme of the interfacial polymerisation leading to Nylon 6,6 formation\nSuch interfacial polymerisation reaction is extremely fast and allows the rapid formation of tough, \nsolid  and  homogeneous  membranes  at  the  aqueous\/organic  interface.  These  polymeric  barriers \nprovide controlled transport of gas molecules. Reaction rates of aliphatic acid chlorides with primary \namines were reported as ranging from 102 up to 104 L.mol-1.s-1 in homogeneous solutions [28]. The \nupper value of 104 L.mol-1.s-1 was used to assess the fastest characteristic time of reaction at the \ninterface, which was used in the timescale analysis in Section 3.1 of this paper. The kinetics and \nmechanisms  of  polycondensation  in  a  two-phase  system  depends  in  part  on  the  nature  of  the \nsolvents. One of the solvents is usually water as it dissolves both the diamine and the low molecular \nweight reaction product (ammonium salts).  The choice of organic solvent  is  important however \nbecause it dominates the distribution of reagents between the two phases, diffusion behaviour of the \nreagents as well as polymer swelling and permeability [31].\n3\nConventional methods for membrane fabrication usually rely on either wet or immersion casting, \npolymerisation,  phase  inversion  on  solid  substrates  by  solvent  evaporation,  spin-coating  or \nelectropolymerisation. Membranes formed in this manner can be quite thick, or may need a backing \nsupport, and their permeability properties are difficult to control. However, for spin-coating, there is \na similarity with the present system in that interfacial  shear varies with spin speed,  which does \nimpact membrane thickness.\nSuspended  membranes  proposed  here,  and  formed  as  an  initial  phase  separation  layer  at  a \ncontrolled laminar flow interface could provide a route to barrier film formation with the potential to \nallow for new solute permeability profiles using existing materials. Such a separation of chemical \nspecies, based on both chemical and physical outcomes of the forming process, could be further \nmodified by the addition of chemical inclusions (e.g. lipids, surfactants, enzymes) or by surface \nmodification.  Resulting suspended walls inside microchannels could be used in microseparation, \nmicroreactions as well  as biochemical analysis. Controlled  in situ formation\/degradation of such \nmembranes could also lead the way to the use of \u201cintelligent\u201d valves, with an ability to redirect flows \nto specific channels [17].\nThe study presented in [15] serves as a \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d for the laminar flow patterning method \nof polymer membrane fabrication (see Fig. 2). However, little is known about the influence of the \nmicrofluidic device geometry and carrier liquid flow rates on the formation of polymer membranes \nat the interface.\nFig. 2. Schematic of polymer membrane formation at the interface between two solvents.\nSolvent 1\nReagent 1\nSolvent 2\nReagent 2\nInterface\nInterfacial reaction\n(e.g. polymerisation)\nPermselective\nmembrane\nSample stream Buffer stream\nMembrane applications:\n Sample separation\n Mass transport control\n Enzyme immobilisation\n Cell immobilisation\n(           Mass transport of reagents) (           Sample mass transport to the membrane)\nView of channel cross-section\n4\nApart from the reaction kinetics, the initial stages of membrane formation are influenced by two \nphysical phenomena - the flow of the carrier liquids and the diffusion of the reagents. The first \nphenomenon -  diffusion between two laminar streams in a microchannel  has been studied by a \nnumber of researchers analytically [18,19], experimentally [5,19,20] and numerically [18,20] and the \neffects  of  reagent  delivery  on  the  initial  stages  of  a  diffusion  governed  reaction  is  fairly  well \nunderstood. However the second issue, the stability of the carrier liquid flow, proves to be more \ndifficult to analyse. Although low Reynolds numbers (<100) of the microflows typically used in \nmicrofabrication applications ensure that flow occurs free from shear-induced instabilities [21], the \njump of viscosity and density across the carrier liquids can induce interfacial instabilities even at \nvery low Reynolds numbers [22,23,24]. Most of the studies of this interfacial instability available in \nthe literature are focused on two-dimensional flows and the stability of the interface between streams \nof different liquids for essentially three-dimensional microfluidic geometries is difficult to analyse \ntheoretically.\nIn this study we consider experimentally the formation of nylon 6,6 membrane using the same \nreaction as in [15] with xylene and high-purity deionised water used as carrier liquids for  adipoyl \nchloride and hexamethylenediamine respectively, in order to analyse the influence  of microfluidic \ndevice geometry and flow rates on the membrane formation.  We also perform numerical simulation \nof the carrier liquids flow using both commercially available CFD package (FLUENT) and in-house \ncodes developed for variable density multicomponent flows [25,26], in order to estimate the stability \nof the experimental flow configuration and analyse the near-wall shear stresses affecting membrane \nattachment.\n2. Experimental\n2.1. Chemicals\nReagents  of  the  highest  grade  commercially  available  were  used  for  the  preparation  of  the \n5\naqueous and organic phases and synthesis of nylon 6,6 by interfacial polycondensation. Adipoyl \nChloride, hexamethylenediamine and xylene were purchased from Aldrich. High-purity deionised \nwater was used for preparation of the aqueous phase.\n2.2. Flow structure fabrication\nThe structures tested for controlled flow entry were based on various geometries. Each of these was \nfabricated in house using microscope glass slides (52 mm x 76 mm, thickness of 1.2mm) as the \nlower base and cover slips (22 mm x 22mm, thickness of 0.1 mm) as channel sidewalls. These walls \nwere  obtained  by  cutting  the  glass  cover  slips  and  bonding  them  in  the  correct  geometrical \narrangement onto the lower glass plate using a UV-curable adhesive, Loctite 3211, purchased from \nLoctite (UK). The top of the channel was sealed using a full uncut cover slip (22 mm x 22mm) \nbonded to rest of the structure in a similar manner. By this method, a wide variety of flow structures \nwere assembled (Fig. 3). Input and output connectors were fabricated by UV-bonding the conical \ntips (5 mm) of conventional Eppendorf pipettes (Type D, blue, 50-1000 \u00b5l capacity, purchased from \nVWR, UK) to entry and exit  channels of the flow structures.  Finally, in order to ensure proper \nsealing of channels and to prevent leakage, all junctions were sealed using an additional layer of \nepoxy resin (Araldite\u00ae) and left to set overnight.\n               \n                               (a)                                                   (b)                                                        (c)\n6\n                           (d)                                                        (e)                                                     (f)\nFig. 3. Schematics of the various flow structures used for this study. (Shaded circular areas are \npoints of fluid entry and locations of pipette tips)\n2.3. Flow protocols\nPressure driven flow was generated using a  KdScientific  200 syringe pump,  purchased form \nRoyem  Scientific  Ltd  (UK),  fitted  with  two  10ml  glass  syringes  (14.67  mm  inner  diameter), \nallowing for flow rates range between 0.001 \u00b5l\/h and 20.91 ml\/min. For each experiment, single \nnylon structures were prepared inside the various flow structures. For that purpose, adipoyl chloride \nin xylene (62.5 mM) and hexamethylenediamine in 0.1 M NaOH solution (62.5 mM) were prepared \nand used as  organic  and  aqueous  immiscible  phases.  For  each experiment,  both solutions  were \ninjected simultaneously with identical flow rates. Various volume flow rates (500, 1000, 2000 and \n4000 \u00b5l\/min, respectively) were used for preparing the single nylon membrane structures. Images \nwere  captured  by  a  Motic  BA400  trinocular  microscope  (purchased  from VWR),  fitted  with  a \nMoticam 1000 high-resolution (1280x1024) digital camera.\n3. Results and discussion\n7\n3.1. Carrier flow analysis\nAdipoyl  chloride  and  hexamethylenediamine  are  supplied  into  the  main  channel  where  the \nreaction  takes  place,  as  dilute  solutions  of  the  carrier  liquids,  i.e.,  xylene  and deionised  water, \nrespectively.  The  effect  of  the  solute  on  the  bulk  density  and  viscosity  of  these  solutions  is \nnegligible.\nFlow  development  in  the  channel  depends  on  the  timescale  associated  with  pressure  waves \npropagation through water; the estimate for the flow development time, based on the speed of sound \nin water [27] and half channel width, yields a value of approximately 7x10-7 s. The time required for \ncompletion of Nylon 6,6 formation,  based on a rate constant of 104 L.mol-1.s-1 [28] and reagent \nconcentration, is approximately 2x10-3  s. Using the estimates of diffusion coefficient according to \nempirical molecular weight correlation [29,30], it is possible to determine the diffusion time as being \nof the order of 103  s for half channel width transfer. Finally, the time of convection, based on the \naverage velocity and channel half-width, varies from 1.2x10-2  s to 1.5x10-3  s for the range of flow \nrates used (500 \u2013 4000 \u00b5L\/min.). From these estimates, it is possible to conclude that the timescale \nof the polymerisation process is much greater than the timescale of flow development. Therefore, at \nthe initial stages of membrane formation, the hydrodynamics of the problem is dominated by the \ndeveloped flow of the carrier liquids.\nThe computational aspect of this study was motivated by the need to shed light on the effects of \nshear stresses induced by the carrier-liquid flows, which could possibly prevent the attachment of \nformed nylon to  the  walls  of  the microfluidic  channel.  When nylon  forms at  the  interface,  the \nviscosity is locally increased, thereby increasing shear stress. Therefore, shear-stress values of the \ncarrier  liquids  provide  the  lower-bound  for  the  shear  stress  at  the  initial  stages  of  membrane \nformation.  Furthermore,  although the Reynolds  numbers  occurring  in  this  case  are  fairly  small, \nranging from Re = 8.4 to 67.2, based on water properties and channel depth, the flow of two fluids in \na channel can develop interfacial instabilities even at low Reynolds numbers [22,23,24].\nThe flow was modelled as a variable-density multispecies flow of immiscible fluids, for which a \n8\nset of Navier-Stokes equations was solved together with an advection equation for the density of \nxylene [25,26].\nIn  order  to  investigate  the  flow  of  carrier  liquids,  we  also  carried  out  a  computational \ninvestigation of a Y-inlet channel with a 45 degrees inlet angle, for the maximum and minimum \nvalues  of  the  flow  rates  considered  in  the  experiment.  The  results  of  these  simulations  are \nsummarised below.\nSince gravity force acts on the plane of the interface between the carrier fluids, both flow stability \nand the developed flow velocity profile depend primarily on the ratio of viscosities of the carrier \nliquids.  The dynamic viscosity of xylene depends on the isomer composition and so varies between \n0.62 and 0.76 mPa.  In order to estimate the influence of viscosities ratio, computations for the \nmaximum and minimum possible viscosity of xylene were carried out.\nFig. 4. Developed velocity profiles for maximum (a) and minimum (b) xylene viscosity.\nDepending on the flow rate, the length required for the flow to become fully developed in the \nmain channel varies from 2 to 6 channel widths (entrance length). Once the flow has been fully \ndeveloped  the  dominant  component  of  the  velocity  is  the  streamwise  (or  X in  our  co-ordinate \nsystem). From the velocity profiles it can be seen that the interface between xylene and water tends \nto shift towards xylene. Fig. 4 shows an example of the developed velocity profile in the cross-\nsection of the main channel at a flow rate of 4000 \u00b5l\/min for maximum (Fig. 4a) and minimum (Fig. \n9\n4b) dynamic viscosities of xylene. In this figure, the region with lower velocity corresponds to the \ncarrier liquid with lower viscosity (xylene). The flow was found to be stable for both values of \ndynamic viscosity. The interface between xylene and water tends to shift towards xylene. This effect \nis explained by the fact that the same flow rates are maintained in both inlets. Thus, in order to \nachieve a given flow rate,  the carrier  liquid moving at  a higher velocity needs a smaller  cross-\nsection. The displacement of the interface increases when increasing the flow rate and water\/xylene \nviscosity ratio (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5. Interface position in the middle of the channel: a) Q=500 \u03bcl\/min; b) Q=4000 \u03bcl\/min .\nFig.  6 shows the values of the shear stress at the upper wall  of the microfluidic channel for \ndifferent flow rates\/viscosities of xylene plotted on the line of the interface between the liquids. Wall \nshear  stress  increases  linearly  with flow rate,  so shear  stress  can  reach large values  preventing \nmembrane attachment to the wall. On the other hand, shear stress is seen to drop near the entrance of \nthe microfluidic channel, where the initial membrane formation takes place.\n10\nFig. 6. Wall shear stress along the interface between the carrier liquids:\na) Q=500 \u03bcl\/min; b) Q=4000 \u03bcl\/min .\nComputations were also performed for a T-inlet channel revealing similar trends to the Y-channel \ncase for the effect of xylene viscosity and flow rates. However, the T-geometry favours a lower \nvelocity at the interface between the two liquids at the beginning of the channel. Fig. 7 shows the \nmagnitude of the velocity at the interface between xylene and water in the middle of the channel as a \nfunction of the channel length.\nFig. 7. Velocity magnitude along the interface between the carrier liquids in the middle of the \nchannel: a) Q=500 \u03bcl\/min b) Q=4000 \u03bcl\/min .\n11\nT-channel geometry exhibits non-uniform velocity profile development at high flow rates, which \nmay lead to non-uniform membrane formation.\n3.2. Membrane formation\nPolycondensation of Nylon 6,6 is a rapid reaction at the solution interface and was achieved using \nvarious  flow  structures,  including  a  Y-shaped  flow device  (Fig.8)  which  was  favoured  by  the \nsimulation studies with respect to membrane stability and quality.\nFig. 8. Schematic of a Y- channel for dual organic\/aqueous solution entry and membrane formation.\nA key requirement for the interfacial condensation here is the stable liquid-liquid interface. Under \nthe current arrangements, a stable interface between dual laminar flows of xylene and water was \nobserved at all flow rates (Fig. 9) in accordance with the numerical results. Minor interface deviation \nat 4000 \u00b5l\/min is thought to be due to the imperfection of the channel entrance. The deviation of the \ninterface towards the side of the less viscous fluid (xylene) is more visible for low flow rates. 2000 \n\u00b5l\/min appeared to be ideal for optimum stability and was used for  in situ fabrication and to help \nprovide a continuous membrane at the interface between xylene and water in laminar flows.\nAdipoyl chloride\nin xylene\nHexamethylenediamine\nin aqueous solution\nOutput\nMonomer molecules interdiffusing\nand reacting at the interface\n12\nFig. 9. Stable laminar flow interfaces between xylene and water at various\nflow rates in the Y-structure (Fig. 3b).\nA series  of  experiments was performed using the different  flow cell  structures.  Results  were \ncritically  dependent  on  different  flow  geometries  and  flow  rates.  The  following  represents  the \ninteraction of these two parameters on the final formed nylon membranes.\n                          (a)                                   (b)                                 (c)                               (d)\nFig. 10. Images of wet membranes obtained using T-channels at different flow rates.\nDeionised\nwater\nXylene500 \u00b5l\/min 1000 \u00b5l\/min\n2000 \u00b5l\/min 4000 \u00b5l\/min\nNylon 6,6\nmembranes\nChannel\nwalls\nOrganic\nphaseAqueousphase\nNylon 6,6\nmembranes\nChannel\nwalls\n500 \u00b5l\/min                       1000 \u00b5l\/min                      2000 \u00b5l\/min                    4000 \u00b5l\/min\n13\nFor the  T-channel  (Fig.  3a),  dual  liquid flow rates were  varied in  line  with those in  Fig.  9. \nMembrane  structures  that  formed in  each  case  were  incomplete  along the  1cm channel  length. \nConsistent  with  the  observations  made  using  liquid-only  flows  (Fig.  9),  the  most  even  and \ncontinuous membrane structures were seen at 2000 \u00b5l\/min. Above and below this flow rate, there \nwas considerably greater unevenness and failure of complete membrane formation (Fig. 10). Thus, \nfor 500 \u00b5l\/min (Fig. 10a), coarse and uneven structures of approximately 300 - 500 \u00b5m thicknesses \nwere deposited. This would suggest that, despite diffusion limitation and a thicker unstirred Nernst \nlayer compared with rapid flow, more polymer formed at the interface. A possible explanation for \nthis  is  the  greater  shear  forces  at  higher  flow rates  leading  to  the  removal  of  nascent  polymer \nmaterial, thus leaving only the consolidated central film. This seems to be confirmed by the fact that, \nat  higher  flow rates  (Fig.  10b-c),  thinner  (100 \u00b5m thickness)  and  more  even membranes  were \nproduced. Furthermore, the disruption of the membrane observed at 4000 \u00b5L\/min. (Fig. 10d) could \nbe the result of extremely high shear forces acting on an already thin, hence more fragile membrane.\nThese results indicate the fragility of the initial formed structures, problems of surface adhesion \nand the  high  impact  of  minor  flow asymmetry.  Importantly,  therefore,  varying  flow rate  had a \nmarked influence on the quality of formed membranes. In all cases, the Reynolds numbers were low \n(less than 70). Equivalent studies were made using the other flow cell structures, shown in Fig. 3.\n14\nFig. 11. Images of membranes obtained using Y-channels at different flow rates.\nFor the membranes obtained using Y-channels (Fig.  3b), performance improved giving better \nquality membranes at high flow rates (Fig.11), with the same trend towards more even, continuous \nand  thinner  structures  as  flow rate  increased.  The  significant  improvement  over  the  quality  of \ngenerated  membranes  compared  with  T-channels  is  apparently  due  to  the  orthogonal  line  of \napproach of the fluids in these structures, which as computations indicate, should result in thicker \nmembrane in the inlet, which is indeed observed in the experiment.  Higher flow rates lead to the \nreduction of the reaction zone, however the velocity profile development then becomes non-uniform \n(see Fig. 11).\nThe Y-shaped structure, with an input angle of 45\u00ba, offers a smoother development of the velocity \nprofile at the fluid interface, which results in thinner membrane near the inlet. Again, as the flow rate \nincreases, the reaction zone becomes even thinner, which facilitates the development of a smooth \nmembrane.\nThe CY-channel (Fig. 3c) features a curved entry point near the walls.  This was intended to \nreduce any initial perturbations.\nNylon 6,6\nmembranes\nChannel\nwalls\nOrganic\nphase\nAqueous\nphase\nEpoxy resin\nnear exit\n500 \u00b5l\/min                      2000 \u00b5l\/min                      4000 \u00b5l\/min\n10 \nm\nm\n2 mm\n15\nFig. 12. Images of membranes obtained using CY-channels at different flow rates.\nWith the CY-channel, the quality of the resulting membranes improved over that obtained using both \nT-  and  Y-shaped  flow  structures.  For  all  flow  rates,  membranes  were  firmly  anchored.  They \nappeared  to  be  continuous  and  showed  no  breaks  (Fig.  12).  This  overall  improvement  can  be \nexplained by the smooth parabolic entry of fluids into the main channel, orienting the fluids in a \nlongitudinal direction parallel to the channel walls, thus preventing the build-up of an overpressure \nand, consequently, helping the membrane to form, attach and grow more uniformly along the length \nof the flow structure.\nAgain,  for the CY-channel,  membranes resulting from fluids injected at  low flow rates were \nsubstantially  thicker  than  those  obtained  with  fluids  at  high  flow  rates.  This  underlines  the \nimportance of residence time in controlling lateral transport of precursors to the interface. Because \nof  the  advantage  seen  with  entry  curvature,  a  specific  structure,  the  C-channel  (Fig.  3d)  was \ninvestigated, which had curvature at the main channel.\nNylon\nmembrane\nChannel\nwalls\nAqueous\nphase\nOrganic\nphase\n500 \u00b5l\/min                         1000 \u00b5l\/min                        2000 \u00b5l\/min                       4000 \u00b5l\/min\n16\nFig. 13. Image of membrane obtained using C-channel at 4000 \u00b5l\/min.\nThis structure however failed to generate stable solvent interfaces, and uneven, fragmented and \nlaterally displaced membranes were produced regardless of flow rate (channel width here changed \nfrom entry: 2 mm to exit: 0.6 mm), and due to this, a gradient of velocities was likely to have been \ncreated towards the channel exit. This will have affected flow symmetry despite a nominal symmetry \nto this flow cell. However, the entry angle for the fluids was 120\u00ba, making this structure closer to a \nT-channel than a Y-channel design, which would also promote the build-up of an overpressure near \nthe entry point, typical of high entry angles. This geometry is currently unsuitable but the integrity of \nmembrane structures at high flow rates (Fig. 13) suggests that, with further optimisation, there may \nbe a possibility to harness convergent compressive forces to stabilise formed layers.\nAll the above flow structures featured a single output channel without a second exit anchoring \npoint where the membrane could more easily attach to be better held inside the fluidic assembly. \nTherefore, a symmetrical double Y shape (DY-channel) was designed (see Fig. 3e) and used to study \nthe impact of a dual angular outflow. Here, both inputs and outputs were at an angle of 45\u00ba.\nMembrane\nOrganic\nphase\nAqueous\nphase\nChannel\nwalls\nExit\n17\nFig. 14. Images of membranes obtained using DY-channels at different flow rates.\nThe outcome, however, was high flow asymmetry, with selective lateralisation of outflows and \nshifting of formed membranes to one or other wall  (Fig.  14).  The preferential  nylon deposition \ntowards one outlet then led to build-up of backpressure on that side and asymmetry at the entire \nmembrane. With the X-channel construct (Fig. 3f), no discrete membrane formation was possible. \nDespite the proximity of two attachment points and clear flow symmetry, no stable laminar dual \nphase could be established.\n4. Conclusions\nVarious flow structures and flow conditions were used to demonstrate the major impact that both \nchannel geometry and flow rate have on the quality of generated nylon 6,6 membranes generated in \nsitu by interfacial polycondensation. The best membranes were observed for Y-shaped structures \nwith a 45\u00ba entry angle, curved input walls and a single exit. This was favoured both by laboratory \nexperiments and computer simulations performed in the course of this study. The combination of \nthese geometrical features and a flow rate of 2000 \u00b5l\/min reduced the likelihood of overpressure at \nthe entry of the channel. This allowed the nylon 6,6 membranes to attach and to grow so as to \ngenerate a linear, continuous, thin and even membrane from the Y-junction down to the exit of the \nchannel. This membrane is parallel to the walls of the channels thanks to the lateral shear forces \nexerted by the two immiscible laminar fluids onto the film.\n 500 \u00b5l\/min\n4000 \u00b5l\/min\nMembranes Channel wallsOrganic\nphase\nAqueous\nphase\nY-shaped exit\n18\nThe analysis of shear stresses indicates that the near-wall stresses increase linearly with the flow \nrate and can reach large values preventing membrane attachment to the wall. This effect can be \nresponsible for  non-uniform membrane formation at  high flow rates.  Note that  the flows at  the \nReynolds numbers and viscosity ratios considered here remain laminar irrespective of the flow cell \ndesign.  Therefore, the differences observed are not associated with turbulent flow effects but are \ndue to the effects of the geometry on the flow development particularly near the entrance region.\nFuture work will emphasize smaller entry angles and the further testing of the attachment profiles \nof membranes to the channel structures. It is likely that this basic system can be extended to the use \nof copolymers, blends, lipids and surfactants to modulate bulk and surface properties for transport \ncontrol.\nAcknowledgment\nThe investigation was performed with the financial support of the Engineering and Physical Sciences \nResearch Council (GR\/S13668).\nReferences\n[1] M.
