Residual stresses have in the past been introduced to manipulate growth \nrates and shapes of cracks under cyclic loads.  Previously, the effectiveness of shot \npeening in retarding the rate of fatigue crack growth was experimentally studied.  It \nwas shown that the compressive residual stresses arising from the shot peening process \ncan affect the rate of crack growth.  Laser Shock Peening can produce a deeper \ncompressive stress field near the surface than shot peening.  This advantage makes this \ntechnique desirable for the manipulation of crack growth rates.  This paper describes \nan experimental program that was carried out to establish this effect in which steel \nspecimens were partially laser peened and subsequently subjected to cyclic loading to \ngrow fatigue cracks.  The residual stress fields generated by the laser shock peening \nprocess were measured using the neutron diffraction technique.  A state of compressive \nstress was found near the surface and tensile stresses were measured in the mid-\nthickness of the specimens.  Growth rates of the cracks were observed to be more \naffected by the tensile core than by the compressive surface stresses. \n \n \nKEYWORDS Fatigue Crack Growth; Laser Peening, Residual Stress, Neutron \nDiffraction \n \n1 INTRODUCTION \n \nThe compressive residual stresses arising from surface treatment techniques such as \nshot and laser peening are currently assumed to retard fatigue crack growth and delay \nthe initiation of fatigue cracks [1].  The rationale behind this is that the compressive \n\u2018beneficial\u2019 stress which is locked in the component will, when the component is loaded \nexternally, superimpose on the applied stress.  In case of a tensile applied stress, this \nsuperposition results in a total stress which is lower than the externally applied stress \nand therefore leads to lower stress intensity factors at the crack tip. \n \nLaser shock peening is a surface treatment technique where a solid-state laser beam is \npulsed upon a metallic surface, producing a planar shockwave that travels through the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nmaterial [2].  Here laser with a peak power greater that 1 GW is imaged to a spot size of \nabout 5mm\u00d75mm.  Energy densities of 50 to 200 joules per 2cm and pulse durations of \n5 to 30 nanoseconds are typical [3].  As the laser beam irradiates the specimen, high \npressure plasma from an ablative layer on the component is rapidly formed, sending a \nshock wave through the work piece which due to its high pressure travels some \nmillimetres in the material and plastically deforms the material in its wake. \n \nCompared to shot peening, laser peening generally has a much deeper effective \npenetration in the material, and compressive residual stresses can be generated much \nfarther from the surface [4-6]. \n \nIn the past, shot peening has been used to demonstrate this effect on the fatigue crack \ninitiation and growth rate in steel [7] and aluminium specimens [5] under cyclic \nloading.  As an example of the application of these findings, the effect of shot peening \non crack shape control in fatigue specimens has also been studied [6].  The success of \nthese experiments, along with the fact that laser shock peening generates compressive \nstress fields much deeper than those produced by shot peening, is an important factor in \nexpecting even better fatigue resistant results from laser shock peening [5, 8]. \n \nIn order to assess the influence of laser shock peening on fatigue crack growth rate and \nevaluate its advantage over shot peening, a set of experiments was set up which will be \nexplained in the next section. \n \n2 EXPERIMENTS \n \nA set of experiments was carried out where a total of four steel plates were partially \nlaser peened (hereby called specimens 1, 2, A and B), and fatigue cracks were grown \nthrough the peened area in two of them (specimens A nad B).  A starting notch was \nmachined in these two specimens (A and B) and they were then precracked before being \ntreated using laser beams.  The residual stresses arising from the laser peening process \nwere then measured using neutron diffraction strain measurement technique [9]. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1- Specimens 1 and 2 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \nFigure 2- Specimens A and B \n \nFor the purpose of the current study, two types of specimens were examined.  Figure 1 \nshows the specimens which were used to establish the likely relaxation of the residual \nstress by cyclic loading, and fiure 2 shows the two notched and precracked specimens \nwhich were previously subjected to tensile fatigue loading and crack growth..  The \nthickness of all the specimens used was 10mm, and they were made of BS EN 10025 \nGrade S275JR steel [10].  The accuracy of the measurements were determined at the \nexperiment site as within 1% accuracy. \n \nIn order to establish the likely relaxation behaviour of the resiudla stress under the \naction of cyclic loads, specimen 1 was tested as unloaded (or virgin) and specimen 2 \nwas previously subjected to several cycles of tensile loading between 5kN to 55kN \n(corresponding to 5MPa to 55MPa).  This was the range that was used for the fatigue \ncrack growth in specimen A.  To obtain a through-thickness profile of residual stress in \nthe laser peened region in specimens 1 and 2, a total number of eight measurement \npoints were chosen symmetrical with respect to the mid-plane and lying on a line \nnormal to the plane of the specimens at its geometrical centre and all three components \nof strain, namely normal (thourgh thickness), longitudinal (along the longer dimension \nof the specimens) and lateral were taken.  The coordinate of these points are shown in \ntable 1. \n \nResults of the measurments on specimens 1 and 2 show no detectable relaxation (or \ndecrease) in the magnitude of these elastic strains, therefore it was concluded that in the \nscope of the current experiments, no relaxation effect should be considered. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nPoint number  coordinates (mm) \n1   (0,0,4.95) \n2   (0,0,4) \n3   (0,0,3) \n4   (0,0,1) \n5   (0,0,-1) \n6   (0,0,-3) \n7   (0,0,-4) \n8   (0,0,-4.95) \nTable1 showing coordinated of the eight points measured in specimens 1 and 2 \n \nTransformation of the measured elastic strain components to stress components was \nachieved by means of the following equations which are derived when the generalised \nHooke\u2019s law equations are solved for stress components: \n \n( )( ) ( ) ( ) xzyxx\nEE\n\u03b5\n\u03c5\n\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\n\u03c5\u03c5\n\u03c5\n\u03c3\n+\n+++\n\u2212+\n=\n1211\n \n( )( ) ( ) ( ) yzyxy\nEE\n\u03b5\n\u03c5\n\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\n\u03c5\u03c5\n\u03c5\n\u03c3\n+\n+++\n\u2212+\n=\n1211\n            (1) \n( )( ) ( ) ( ) zzyxz\nEE\n\u03b5\n\u03c5\n\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\n\u03c5\u03c5\n\u03c5\n\u03c3\n+\n+++\n\u2212+\n=\n1211\n \n \nA number of other locations were also examined to ensure uniformity of the residual \nstress field in the interior of the peened region.  It was observed that the stress \ncomponenets in each direction were uniform in the peened region.  However, to better \nunderstand the effect of laser peening in terms of the resulting residual stress field, the \nstress profiles on either sides of the boundary of the peened region were measured to \nestablish any \u2018transitional\u2019 effects.  Coordinates of these measurement points are shown \nin table 2; the \u2018peened\u2019 points were 2mm from the boundary and in the peened region, \nand \u2018unpeened\u2019 points were 2mm from the boundary outside the peened region.

Two identical specimens \nwere tested in which fatigue cracks initiating from a notch were grown into a laser \npeened region under cyclic tensile loads.  Details of the laser peened region are shown \nin figure 5. \n \n  \n \nFigure 5- showing the notch as starter crack.

Given the cross section dimensions of these specimens as mmmm 10010 \u00d7 , \nthese loads respectively correspond to 5-55MPa and 5-95MPa of tensile stress.

Based on the experience from shot peened \nspecimens, a sudden halt in the growth of the crack was expected in the boundary of the \ntreated region. \n \nFrom the figures of stress distribution in the specimens (figures 3 and 4) it is evident \nthat a tensile core of material exists in the midsection of the specimens.  These tensile \nstresses may jeopardise the beneficial effect of the superficial, compressive stresses that \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nexist in the component.  Both the stresses inside and outside of the peened region are \nused when calculating the stress intensity factor values using the weight function \ntechnique. \n \nWeight functions [11,12] can be used to evaluate the stress intensity factor values for \narbitrary stress distributions in cracked components.  Due to the three dimensional \nnature of the problem, both the residual stresses and the stresses arising from the \nexternally applied tensile force vary along the thickness of the specimen ahad of the \ncrack tip.  Kotousov and Wang [13] have used the assumption of a generalised plane-\nstrain theory and derived the stress concentrations for specimens with V-shaped notches \nand a circular tip.  Z Li and W Guo [14] have also expressed this three-dimensional \nstress field ahead of blunt V-notches using a series of finite element analyses.  Both \npapers confirm the three dimensionality of the elastic stress field arising from the \napplication of the external tensile load. \n \nAn important decision at this stage is how to incorporate the residual stress values \nobtained from the neutron diffraction test in a one-dimensional analysis.  It may seem \nsensible that whereas a point by point superposition of the applied and residual stresses \nis pertient for the case of a full three dimensional anaylsis, for a one dimensional crack \ndealing with the residual stress componenet used for ach point along the crack front \nmay be the average value of the longitudinal component of the redisual stress averaged \nthrough the thickness.  One fundamental problem of the numerical superposition of \nstresses is that when the magnitude of the average compressive residual stress value is \nlarger than the externally applied load, the model predicts no crack growth.  However, \nin reality both cracks did grow.  If the total stress is taken as the superposition of the \napplied and the residual stress, negative values of total stress may be encountered.  This \nsuggests that if an averaged value of the residual stress is to be used for each section, \nthen no Paris law coefficients can be used to predict the outcome of these tests.  The \ncrack growth in specimen A, despite the fact that the average compressive residual \nstress is -120MPa and the externally applied stress was 50MPa, signifies that the \naverage compressive residual stress does not superimpose on the externally applied \nload.  It should also be noted here that the experiment showed that the tensile stresses in \nthe core section of the specimen ensured that the supeficial compressive stresses presnt \nin the peened region did not cause the crack faces to contact during the fatigue testing, \nthus making the weight function approach valied.  The fact that the crack grew indicates \nthat K values are positive and non-zero.  This will be discussed in detail in the next \nsection. \n \nTo overcome this problem, the concept of \u2018effective fatigue stress\u2019 is introduced, which \nis the stress value that should be used for the evaluation of stress intensity factors in \nlaser peened specimens when using one dimensional weight functions.  This stress is \nhere called the \u2018effective fatigue stress\u2019. \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nIn order to derive the effective fatigue stress, the following methodology is proposed.  \nFrom the \ndN\nda\n values, experimental SIFs can be evaluated.  These values depend on the \ncoefficients obtained from the CT test.

Specimens were partially laser peened and were then subjected to cyclic \nfatigue loading in order to grow fatigue cracks.  Due to the high levels of compressive \nresidual stresses at the surface of the specimen, and analogous to the effect of shot \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \npeening on crack growth, it was expected that the cracks should show considerable \nretardation upon reaching the treated region. \n \nHowever, crack length vs. number of load cycle measurements did not show any \nconsiderable retardation of the fatigue cracks.  This is believed to be due to the tensile \ncore in the material that arises as a by-product of laser shock peening.  This tensile \nregion is essential for the internal balance of forces in the unloaded component. \n \nThe concept of effective fatigue stress was introduced and its evaluation was proposed.  \nFrom the analysis of the test results it is evident that when dealing with laser shock \npeened specimens, traditional superposition of applied and residual stresses may lead to \nerroneous predictions, and a more rigorous, three dimensional analysis may always be \nrequired.. \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, \nHarwell for the opportunity to use EnginX facility at ISIS for neutron diffraction \nresidual stress measurement. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
