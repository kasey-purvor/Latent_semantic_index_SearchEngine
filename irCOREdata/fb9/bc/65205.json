Agility is \ndefined as responsiveness to unpredictability, particularly unpredictable events \nin the environment external to a process. The general need for agile response \nin turbulent environments is well documented and has been analysed at the \nmanufacture phase. \nThis paper introduces a framework for an agile response to these turbulent \nenvironments during the design stages of product development. The Agile \nDesign Framework is based on the founding principles described as DET, with \nthe added benefit of reduced reaction time and therefore greater agility in the \nface of unpredicted external events. A 4 level classification scheme for event \nimpact is discussed and a common toolbox of Digital Enterprise Technologies \n(Core Tools) for agile design is introduced. The paper proposes the \nimplementation of the DET-based Core Tools during a meta-design stage, for \nmaximum benefit from the synergies of the many systems. \n \n \n1.  INTRODUCTION \n \nThe benefits of agility in the manufacture of products is well documented. [Jiang et \nal, 2003, Kara et al 2001] Recent research has also explored the application of agile \nmethodologies from the manufacturing process to other aspects of the product \ndevelopment cycle [Matthews et al, 2005]. This paper builds on the Agile Design \nFramework [Armoutis et al 2003], an extension of the Digital Enterprise Technology \nmethodology, previously defined by the authors to propose a meta-design stage of \nthe design process, during which the Core Tools of the Agile Design Framework are \ndefined and configured. This meta-design stage is undertaken once the initial \nrequirements gathering has been completed and the collaborative design team begins \nto come together, usually under the direction of a prime contractor or system \nintegrator. \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the \nbackground research activities of the team in the area of agile design, and introduces \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n2  Digital Enterprise Technology \n \nthe Agile Design Framework in the context of Digital Enterprise Technologies. \nSection 3 presents the Core Tools of the Agile Design Framework while Section 4 \npresents the arguments for a meta-design stage and the proposed benefits of \nintroducing an additional stage in to the design process, with a view to reducing the \noverall process time. Section 5 discusses the findings with regard to the theoretical \nbenefits of Digital Enterprise Technologies for Agile Design while Section 6 \nconcludes the paper and proposes the next steps in Agile Design research. \n \n \n2.  BACKGROUND \n \nIn order to concentrate on unique core competences, there is a trend towards \nmultiple smaller companies collaborating on a short-term basis to acquire all the \nnecessary competencies to complete a project, without having to each maintain the \nexcess competences during projects for which they are not required [Lomas et al, \n2005]. This allows Virtual Enterprises to have the knowledge of a large organisation \nwithout the overheads associated with one. Companies are selected on the basis of \ntheir expertise [Lomas et al, 2005]. The Virtual Enterprise forms the basis of the \nAgile Design Framework, which seeks to define what happens when a design \nproject, decomposed into multiple distributed components, is interrupted by an \nUnpredictable External Event (UEE).  \nThe level of impact of a UEE has been categorised into 4 levels of severity \n[Maropoulos, 2003], and each can be dealt with in a different manner. Trivial events \ncan be resolved completely at the local level, incurring a small penalty, represented \nas time. This could be a requirements change due to government legislation, but \ncrucially, the existing agent is still able to satisfy the requirements and deliver its \npart of the design. Minor events require the agent to seek external assistance, or \nredeploy a part of the work to another partner. For example specialist knowledge in \na particular field will now be needed, so another partner with the necessary \ncompetence is brought into the project team to assist. A major UEE cannot be \nresolved by the agent or another member of the virtual enterprise. The redeployment \nof work to a new team member and initiation of the new member to the project \nincurs a serious time penalty. Finally a fatal UEE cannot be resolved by the agent, \nand there exists no external agent that can provide support. Effectively, the design is \nfundamentally flawed and is not realisable. \nEach UEE has an impact (normally negative) on the percentage of work \nremaining for that stage, which can be translated into a time penalty. If the task is on \nthe critical path, then the time penalty is transferred to a global time penalty for the \nproject. \nThe goal of an agile system, in this case a design process, is to have the ability to \nrespond quickly to unpredicted changes in the environment. The nature of the events \nhave been discussed here, in terms of there causes and the level of impact they \nimpose on a project. In order to respond to these events, the Digital Enterprise \nTechnology (DET) Framework [Maropoulos, 2003] presents an initial template on \nwhich we can build a set of Core Tools comprising the Agile Design Framework. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nImplementing Digital Enterprise Technologies for Agile Design in the virtual \nenterprise 3 \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Time penalty caused by a UEE \n \nThe Agile Design framework is aligned to the DET framework (Figure 2) \nthrough a common distributed and collaborative environment. Agile Design builds \non the 4 cornerstones of DET to identify specific Digital and associated tools. The \nmain focus of exploiting the synthesis between digital tools across the product \nlifecycle has been risk mitigation through eliminating conversions between partners \nand software systems, and to allow more seamless access to data across the Product \nLifecycle. \n \n \n \nFigure 2. The 4 cornerstones of Digital Enterprise Technology \nDistributed and Collaborative \nProduct Design \nDistributed and Collaborative \nProcess Design & Planning \nEquipment and Plant Layout \nDesign & Modeling  \n \nPhysical-to-Digital Environment \nIntegrators \nTechnologies for Enterprise \nIntegration & Logistics \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP \nD \nM \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n4  Digital Enterprise Technology \n \nThe aim of the Agile Design Framework is to develop this methodology in order \nto reduce not only the conventional product development time, but also use the \nDigital environment and the physical to digital integrators to reduce the penalty \n(time, economic or quality) caused by unpredictable external events.  \n \n \n3.  CORE TOOLS FOR AGILE DESIGN \n \n3.1 Competence Profiling \n \nIn the event of a minor or major level of UEE, there exists a requirement for external \nintervention, either in assisting an existing agent of the project, or in replacing a \nfailed agent. This process of identifying alternative agents has been shown to delay \nprojects\u2019 progress, due to a lack of direction in the search for new agents and a lack \nof information about their capabilities and competencies being available [Lomas et \nal, 2005]. During this process no direct work is completed on the project and a time \npenalty can be incurred. Competence Profiling is one tool which can be used to \nrespond more rapidly when a new agent is needed. Companies complete an on-line \nform relating to their core competences, as well as other information such as \ngeographical locations, international awards obtained and current customers. This \ndatabase can then be searched for one or more competences in a single search, and a \ncompany or group of companies will be scored and recommended based on their \nperformance against the search criteria. The Competence Profiling system then \nprovides a full company report on any companies that could be investigated further \nto meet the requirements. In this way, the process of finding companies to assist or \nreplace existing agents is greatly speeded up. \n \n3.2 Design for Assembly \n \nIn the cases of minor and major events, where external companies are brought into a \nproject part-way through, it is important that they can be integrated as easily as \npossible in order to minimize the delay caused by their inexperience with the \nproject. Design for manufacture principles such as the use of early defined and \nstandard interfaces between components\/sub-assemblies, can help this. This \nprinciple is also referred to as de-coupling tasks [Ulrich et al, 2005] and Modular \nArchitecture [Gu et al, 2004]. \n \n3.3 International Standards \n \nInternational Standards such as SI units and terminology can play a vital role in how \nseamlessly a company can integrate into a project part way through. While some \nstandards may be obvious, such as SI units, it is important to stipulate from the \noutset the standards, languages and terminology that will be used for a collaborative \nproject. One example of the importance of this is the use of CAD data. In a \ndistributed and collaborative project where the same CAD packages are used, there \nappears no need to use neutral file formats such as STEP for the exchange of data \nbetween partners. However, if an unexpected event requires that a new agent must \nbe introduced to the project, then it is important that their CAD package does not \n  \n \n \n \n \nImplementing Digital Enterprise Technologies for Agile Design in the virtual \nenterprise 5 \n \nbecome an obstacle and cause further delay, because they cannot easily share files \nwith other agents. The trial carried out by Durham and Oregon State Universities \nclearly showed the negative impact of using different CAD systems for a distributed \ncollaborative design project [Arnold et al, 2004].  \n \n3.4 Web-based Product Data Management \n \nProduct Data Management (PDM) systems have been around for a number of years, \nand recently have migrated to web-based systems. The benefits of this development \nto an agile design process are significant, and related to the previous two tools. Once \na UEE occurs during a project and the level of that UEE has been identified, there \nmay exist a need to introduce new partners to the project. Without the use of a web-\nbased PDM system, the process of integrating that new partner or partners becomes \nmore complex. PDM systems do not only offer access to the majority, if not all, of \nthe information a new agent would need, but also the project history through \ndiscussion boards and document revision control. This insight into the progress of \nthe project so far, the reasons behind decisions made and importantly, any failures \nwhich might have caused their involvement, will mean that any new agent can more \nquickly become effective within the project than if they were entering \u2019blind\u2019. The \nweb-based nature of modern PDM systems can allow a new agent to gain access to \nthis information simply with a username and password, rather than having to speak \nto each of the other affected agents individually. There is also a guarantee that the \nnew agents obtain the most up-to-date information. \nAlthough there exist many other tools which could further increase the agility of \nthe response to unpredictable events, these tools have been identified by the authors \nas Core Tools, that is they can have significant effect on the response time, and are \nreadily available. \n \n \n4.  META-DESIGN \n \nThe Agile Design Framework described in the previous section builds on the DET \nframework to define a set of Core Tools to enhance the benefits into dealing with \nUEEs, therefore creating an agile process. \nAs discussed, the way in which product development projects are carried out has \nchanged over the last ten to twenty years, and now adopts a more collaborative, \ndistributed model. However there is little evidence of the product development \nprocess changing to reflect this trend. \nMeta-Design is proposed as \u2019designing the design process\u2019. In order to maximize \nthe benefits of the core tools it is proposed that all members of the virtual enterprise \nmust be familiar with them and committed to their use. Therefore, the introduction \nof these tools must be well planned in order to maximize the cumulative benefit. \nThe traditional product development process follows a staged process as shown \nin Figure 33.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n6  Digital Enterprise Technology \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Traditional Staged Product Development Process \n \nThrough the introduction of a meta-design stage the virtual enterprise is \npreparing itself for the design process. Therefore, the impact of an Unexpected \nExternal Event can be limited through the use of procedures and tools already \nintroduced and agreed. \nOne example might be the development of a new technology which means that \nwelding airplane wings is possible, rather than the traditional riveting. The Agile \nDesign Framework proposes Competence Profiling as a method of identifying \nspecialist collaborators who could be introduced to the virtual enterprise to assist \nwith this particular change in requirements and reduce the impact of the UEE. If, \nduring a meta-design stage, the existing partners have agreed on Competence \nProfiling via a particular system, then the process of identifying new partners is \ngreatly reduced because training has already taken place on a tool which has been \nagreed and tested. Furthermore, Web-based Product Data Management is a Core \nTool of the Agile Design Framework. By introducing the web-based PDM during a \nmeta-design stage and training administrators, a new company such as that discussed \ncould easily be added to the PDM system and gain access to the relevant project data \nmore quickly. \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Meta-design stage for definition of Core Tools \n  \n \n \n \n \nImplementing Digital Enterprise Technologies for Agile Design in the virtual \nenterprise 7 \n \nThe meta-design stage is best placed in-between Initial Requirements gathering \nand Design to allow the overall integrators of the project to identify the make-up of \nthe virtual enterprise. Competence Profiling may be used to match the initial \nrequirements to interested companies to form the project team. Preliminary \ndiscussions will then allow an initial team to form the virtual enterprise, whose first \ntask should be to develop the customer requirements into concepts. At this stage of \ndesign concepts the issues of data sharing procedures, international standards, \nsoftware standards for sharing digital files and many more become relevant. \nTherefore meta-design, for defining these processes and standards before they \nbecome problems, must precede the conceptual design work, and therefore sits well \nbetween requirements gathering and design. \nThe meta-design should be lead by the integrator or manager of the project, and \nall participating collaborators should be in agreement. At this stage it may be \nappropriate for training to take place. \nIt is also proposed that a part of the meta-design process, in addition to the \nagreement of procedures and tools, should include scenarios to allow partners to \nappreciate the benefits of the Core Tools and procedures, and also enhance \nunderstanding of the way in which they may be used to limit the negative impact of \nany UEEs. This use of scenarios can help to overcome the cultural resistances to \noperating in such an open and collaborative environment. \nEssentially the Meta-Design process facilitates three purposes: \n \n\u2022 Definition of Core Tools  \no Web-based PDM \no Competence Profiling \no International Standards \no Design for Assembly\/Manufacture \n\u2022 Training \n\u2022 Scenario Planning \n \n \n5.  DISCUSSION \n \nThe Agile Design Framework discussed relates specifically to collaborative \ndesign projects in a virtual enterprise. The main focus of research in this area has \nbeen on tools which may be of benefit to the collaborative effort through improved \ndata-sharing. The proposed meta-design stage of the product development process \nallows a virtual enterprise the opportunity to use these and other tools (the Core \nTools) for maximum agility. This is achieved through the definition of tools and \nprocedures, and appropriate training, prior to any design work being undertaken, as \nsoon as the initial partners of the team are identified. \n \n \n6.  CONCLUSIONS \n \nThis paper has introduced the Agile Design Framework as a development of the \nDigital Enterprise Technology methodology for product lifecycle management. The \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n8  Digital Enterprise Technology \n \nAgile Design Framework seeks to exploit the synergies between digital technologies \nin collaborating and distributed organisations to not only mitigate risk, but to \nenhance their ability to respond to Unpredictable External Events. This is achieved \nin a number of ways: Definition of a set of Core Tools used across the virtual \nenterprise for identifying new partners and managing communications within the \nproject team; Early definition of the Core Tools during a meta-design stage which is \nlead by the project integrator and defines the tools and procedures for use \nthroughout the project by all members; The use of scenarios to illustrate the benefits \nof the Core Tools and overcome any resistance. In this way the Digital Technologies \nemployed will be more effective because of early definition and planning, enabling a \nfaster response to Unexpected Events and a reduced product development cycle. \nFuture work will include lab-based experiments to demonstrate the benefits of \nearly implementation of the Agile Design Framework. This will be followed by \nretrospective industrial case analysis and implementation of this methodology in \nindustry. \n \n7.
