In an attempt to update Schaffer\u2019s analysis, Hirschmann \nobserved additional and ongoing divisions that plagued the community of actors \nwith interests in development planning (Hirschmann, 1981; Hirschmann, 1999).  \nOne important dichotomy for development management was articulated as the  \n\u201cradical view of bureaucracy which saw it as an inherent part of the ruling \nclasses\u2026and those who continued to believe that with reform the bureaucracy \ncould serve the interests of their people resulting in a communication breakdown \nin development planning\u201d (Hirschmann, 1981).   The purpose of this article is to \ntrace the contemporary landscape of radical thought on development management \nand suggest that there exists both possibilities and potential for bridging the chasm \nwith its reformist counterparts.  This contemporary radical perspective is ascribed \nas the school of Critical Development Management (CDM) to highlight its \nintellectual debts to two key literatures\u2014Foucauldian post-development theory \nand neo-Marxian critical management studies.  \n\u00a0 3 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n The article asks whether CDM\u2019s main claim\u2014that development \nmanagement is a product of a rational modernist ideology that is perniciously \nmanagerial\u2014is tenable on both theoretical and normative grounds. By examining \nCDM\u2019s roots in critical management studies, this exclusive characterization of \ndevelopment management as managerial is challenged.  CDM remains predicated \non a partial understanding of critical management studies and thus ignores its own \ncapacity to theorize a non-rationalist concept of modernity and by consequence, a \nnon-managerialist development practice.  By borrowing from Romantic \nintellectual traditions, we can obtain an alternative theory of development practice \nthat challenges managerial constructions inspired by Enlightenment social \nideologies of planning and progress.     \n In offering this criticism of CDM, it must be stated from the onset the \nintention is not to question the value of its contribution to development \nmanagement scholarship.  Indeed, there is in CDM the opportunity for a \ndevelopment management that is more \u2018democratic, tolerant and self-critical \napproaches to analysis and action\u2019 (Cooke et al., 2008).   Moreover, the incisive \ncriticism CDM offers of the development management apparatus make us aware \nof its darker side and keeps \u2018the raw nerve of outrage alive\u2019 (Corbridge 2007: \n143). Yet, if the claimed purpose of CDM is not to dismiss management or suggest \nit has no place in development (Willmott, 2008: xiii), this generally appears to be a \nsubordinate goal to their radical deconstruction.1 Critical development \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n1\u00a0This destructive tendency is beginning to frustrate even those who associate themselves \nwith CDM (de Vries, 2008: 160). \u00a0\n\u00a0 4 \nmanagement is largely a subscription to a vision of development practice that is \nunnecessarily and excessively bleak.    \n The overall aim of this article is to demonstrate that it is both theoretically \npossible and normatively desirable that CDM moves towards a more radical-\nreformist centre. In the next section, the radical and reformist positions of \ndevelopment management are presented. This is followed by a deeper \nunderstanding of the ways the radical CDM position characterises all development \nmanagement as managerial. The dominance of Enlightenment ideological \napparatus is attributed to the construction of development management as \nmanagerial. Romanticism is then introduced as an intellectual tradition that can \nchallenge this managerial conception of development management and inspire a \ndifferent kind of practice. This is done by recognising the limits of narrow \nmechanical models of scientific explanation and seeking a more holistic, dynamic \nand indeterminate framework for steering development. The concluding sections \ndemonstrate how the ideas of Romanticism practically and normatively inspire a \nnon- managerial development practice. \n Development management ultimately needs greater integration across \nradical and reformist arguments in order to build societies where equality, \nsustainability, empowerment and justice all prevail.  This centrist position is \nfeasibly achieved by seeing the possibility of a new kind of development \nmanagement inspired by Romantic understandings of society and the social world. \nThe future of development management depends on establishing linkages between \nthose who would radically criticize it as well as optimistically reform it.  \n\u00a0 5 \n(ie. within the local country co\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \nRADICALS AND REFORMERS: THE DILEMMA OF \nDEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT \n What is development management? Early definitions of development \nadministration, the precursor to development management2, underlined two broad \ndefinitions: the development of administration in the developing world and the \nadministration of development programs (Riggs, 1970).  The simplicity of this \ndefinition belies the conceptual imprecision that still afflicts this field (Collins, \n2000; Siffin, 1991: 8).  Despite a variety of alternative definitions, it seems clear \nthat development management can be considered in two dimensions: as a theory of \nplanning and a description of the contents, locus and manner of this planning.  \nAny definition of development management will have both these analytic and \npractical components.  For example, Thomas suggests development management \ncan be understood as the practice of managing in developing countries or \nmanagement of the development effort, depending on whether development is \ntheoretically understood as an uncontrollable historical process (former) or steered \nvia deliberate efforts at social progress (latter) (Thomas, 1996).3  Development \nmanagement is thus an implicit statement on the analytical scope of the planning \nprocess to direct development, as well as a statement on the location of its practice \nntext or in the development policy process).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n2\u00a0Development administration in the post-World War II era sought to transfer modern \nWeberian administrative apparatuses to developing countries to improve planning, direct \nservice provision and economic management (Brinkerhoff, 2008; Hughes, 2003; Turner & \nHulme, 1997).\u00a0\n3 Management for development was later added as an additional category used to describe \nan empowering style of engagement (Thomas, 2007).  \u00a0\n\u00a0 6 \nAnother well known definition speaks with more certainty to the idea of \ndevelopment management as being able to deliberately steer social progress via \nthe application of certain kinds of practices, including as means to foreign aid and \ndevelopment policy agendas, as toolkits to achieve progressive social change by \nlinking intentions to actions, as positive values that address both the style and goal \nof management in political and normative terms, and as processes that operate at \nthe individual, organisational and sectoral levels (Brinkerhoff, 2008; Brinkerhoff \n& Coston, 1999). \n Understandings of development management do not only bifurcate in terms \nof whether planning for development is or is not possible but on whether it is \ndesirable.  A \u2018reformist\u2019 understanding of development management believes in \nthe desirability of planning for the achievement of economic, social and political \nprogress in developing countries.   While development management is not above \nreproach, there has always been an assumed ability and commitment to work \ntowards improvements to policy and practice, particularly in areas of \nadministrative concern. Early definitions underlined this desire to improve both \nthe administration of donor and foundation-sponsored development programmes \nand national administrative capabilities (Riggs, 1970). In the contemporary period, \ndevelopment management has also focused on enhancing performance in both \nrealms, often defined by the twin goals of efficacy and efficiency (Guess & \nGabriellyan, 2007; Heady,Perlman & Rivera, 2007). Failures to improve \nperformance appears to derive from the sub-optimal application of theories in \nmisunderstood and\/or unfavourable contexts (Otenyo & Lind, 2006) or poor \n\u00a0 7 \nspecification of variables and units of analysis (Jreisat, 1991, 2005; Peters, 1994), \nrather than any intrinsic failing in the concept of development management per se.  \nAltering the tools, values, processes and means of development management is an \nimplicit concern for scholars identifying with a reformist perspective (Brinkerhoff, \n2008; Brinkerhoff et al., 1999; Thomas, 1996, 2007).  \n Nevertheless, over the years, an alternative understanding of development \nmanagement has highlighted the power and violence of bureaucratic planning in \ndevelopment.  If reformists can be described as critiquing development \nmanagement, radicals are fundamentally critical of development management.  It \nis the contemporary radical perspective of the left that is identified as Critical \nDevelopment Management.  Although not of central concern to this article, it is \nworth noting that there are a growing number of neo-liberal \u2018radicals\u2019 who argue \nthat centrally planned, geo-politically motivated aid needs to be dismantled and \nreplaced by devolved market-based solutions like micro-finance and social \nentrepreneurship (Easterly, 2006, 2008; Moyo, 2009). \n Radical development theory originates in neo-Marxist political \nperspectives that suggest development management is a project designed to \ntransform developing countries into market-based, elite controlled societies \n(Farazmand, 1996; Loveman, 1996).  Contemporary approaches inspired by this \ncritique adopt a Foucauldian \u2018post-development\u2019 perspective to deconstruct the \ndiscourse of planning in development and advocate for the dissolution of \ndevelopment architectures in favour of those that celebrate indigenous social \nmovements (Corbridge, 1998, 2007; Escobar, 1993, 1995a, b; Ferguson, 1994). \n\u00a0 8 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis critical deconstruction highlights the way development exists as a power-\nknowledge complex that propagates itself via development interventions, \nsubordinates the poor as citizen-subjects and neo-liberalizes social transformation \nto the advantage of elites (Escobar, 1995a, b; Esteva, 1993; Ferguson, 1994; Rist, \n2002).  Scholars working in organizational studies departments in European \nbusiness schools have built linkages between this post-development position and a \ntradition of critical management studies4 to theorize the totalizing and de-\nhumanizing effects of international development management (Banu O Zkazan, \n2008; Cooke, 2004; Cooke & Dar, 2008b; Dar, 2008; Murphy, 2008).   It is this \ngroup of scholars that this article identifies as constituting the contemporary \nradical perspective of Critical Development Management.  Their claim hinges on a \nconviction that there is something \u201cintrinsically wrong with the very idea of \nmanagement and its application in international development\u201d (Cooke & Dar, \n2008a: 1).  This is largely because an apparently benign development management \nlegitimates a universalized and abstract planning apparatus with detrimental \neffects for Third World representation and power.  \n The most coherent and powerful formulation of CDM comes in the form of a \nrecently published book The New Development Management: Critiquing the Dual \nModernization.5  In the introductory chapter, editors Cooke and Dar theorize \ncritical development management by highlighting the continuity between the \n\u00a0\n4 The field of critical management studies constitutes a vibrant left-wing research \ncommunity within organizational studies, with growing numbers situated under its \numbrella working on development-related issues (Academy of Management, 2009). \n5 A number of past works have nevertheless provided a foundation for this formulation \n(Cooke, 1997a, b, 2003; Cooke, 2004).\u00a0\n\u00a0 9 \nworks of Barbara Townley in critical management studies and James Ferguson in \npost-developmentalism.     \nBoth these studies question the ethics of managerialization (in \nTownley) or bureaucratization (in Ferguson) through seemingly \nmundane and neutral practices. [\u2026] Identifying the similarity in \nthese approaches\u2026indicates how the demarcation between critical \nwork on development and critical work on management might \nbegin to be bridged. (Cooke & Dar, 2008: 2).    \n As CDM draws greater linkages between these two sub-fields within \nmanagement and development studies, Cooke and Dar suggest there is a \ntheoretical basis for a new development management.  The term \u2018new development \nmanagement\u2019 is both an attempt at irony and a political tactic, for CDM is in the \nmain a critical analysis of the ways in which contemporary development \nmanagement sustains \u2018modernization and the modern\u2019 by emphasizing \u201cnew\u201d \ntechnical fixes that do not address deeper structural challenges of under-\ndevelopment.  The new development management is the object of criticism for \nCDM, where this critical analysis derives from the perniciousness and \npervasiveness of managerialism in aid interventions.  For CDM, there are long-\nstanding managerial continuities between an earlier terminology of development \nadministration and a more recent turn to development management, even if the \nlatter is largely associated with a smaller and reinvented role for government in the \nimage of the entrepreneurial private sector (Hood, 1991; Minogue, 2001; \nMinogue,Polidano & Hulme, 1998; Osborne & Gaebler, 1992).  Development \n\u00a0 10 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nmanagement is united to earlier understandings of development administration in \nits perception that Third World countries and subjects have still not yet achieved \nmodernity, even as its themes and topics shift (Esman, 1988). Development \nmanagement, like development administration before it, expresses faith in the \nfalsely neutral social engineering of modernization (Cooke et al., 2008: 2, 9, 10). \nAs such, for CDM to describe development management as something \u2018new\u2019 is \nironically to highlight its pernicious continuities with development \nadministration.6\n Contemporary development management remains an important site for \nboth reformist and radical scholarship.  Both perspectives suggest development \nmanagement is increasingly served by a number of different agendas, rationales \nand actors (Brinkerhoff, 2008; Cooke, 2004; Cooke et al., 2008). Nevertheless, \nthey continue to disagree on the prospects for development management as a \npositive source of change.  Radical and reformist positions thus co-exist, although \nwith substantial differences and considerable mutual suspicion of each other.  The \nliteratures and research communities that each side engages with are almost \nalways distinct.  If reformists view radicals as excessively nihilistic, radicals \nperceive reformers as unjustifiably naive.  These differences and mutual \nsuspicions are at the root of the fundamental cleavage between scholars of \ndevelopment management. Nevertheless, it is a central argument for this article \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n6\u00a0The evolution from development administration to development management is more \nthan just a semantic difference for reformers.  It represents a fundamental shift in planning \npractice that has its origins in the bifurcation that occurred between public administration \n(traditionally linked to political science) and public management scholarship (connected \nto public policy and business schools) (Kaboolian, 1998).\u00a0\n\u00a0 11 \nthat the breakdown is both mis-specified and problematic. There exists within the \ntheoretical core of CDM the possibility of a reformed development practice.   By \nignoring this possibility, CDM partially represents critical management studies as \nwell as unnecessarily polarizes the radical and reformist positions in development \nmanagement.  The remainder of this article is an attempt to demonstrate why a \nradical-reformist position is both theoretically and ethically defensible.    \n \nMANAGERIALISM AS DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT  \n Critical development management rests on a singular and foundational \nassumption, namely that all development management is intrinsically and \nexclusively managerial.   But what exactly is managerialism?   Simply, it is an \nideology inspired by Enlightenment rational science and a practice that believes in \nthe ability to achieve organizational success by borrowing from the corporate \nsector (Edwards, 1998; Parkin, 1994; Pollitt, 1990, 1997; Terry, 1998). It is the \nmodern-day version of a rational-comprehensive model of the policy process, \ninspired by the methods of the corporate sector that are associated with the hard \nsciences (Lindblom, 1959; Wood, 1986:477-478).   As McCourt aptly puts it, \nmanagerialism is \u201ca belief that every political problem has a management solution, \nso that the means of management substitute for the ends of policy\u201d (McCourt, \n2001).   It is a mindset that glorifies \u201chierarchy, technology, and the role of the \nmanager in modern society\u2019 (Edwards, 1998: 555).  As a planning process, it \npursues the value of efficiency, exhibits faith in homogeneous, neutral and abstract \ntechnologies and separates the management function from political processes \n\u00a0 12 \n(Edwards, 1998: 561, 572 ; Wilson, 1941). Managerialism rests on the power and \nprestige of an elitist class of managers who control knowledge and access in such \na way that ensures their status and preferential treatment (Murphy, 2008).  The \nideology and practice of managerialism is supported by reformist values that \nregard management as a science that can generate progress efficiently and \nobjectively. \n What propels the construction of development management as managerial?  \nManagerialisation is a trend that extends well beyond the domain of development \nmanagement. Western public services (Covaleski & Dirsmith, 1988; Kitchener, \n2002; Townley, 1997), traditional craft-based industries (Thornton, 2004; \nThornton, 2002) and non-profit ventures (Lewis, 2008; Lohmann, 2007) \n(Roberts,Jones & Frohling, 2005) have all been subject to modernization via the \nintroduction of business management practices.   At one level, corporate \nmentalities and values infuse our understanding of the best ways to organize and \ncoordinate across a variety of sectors as a result of institutional pressures \nemanating from business schools and the private sector (Parker, 2002). Yet, \ncritical management studies explore a deeper driver for managerialisation, namely \nEnlightenment understandings of modernity and the contribution that rational \nscience makes to its achievement.  The fact that management is predominantly \nassociated with managerialism is a reflection of the continuing dominance of \neighteenth century Enlightenment thinking in contemporary society.  \n The methodological style of the Enlightenment is the basis for a concept of \nmodernity anchored to the cosmology of rational science (Bloor, 1991: 62-63; \n\u00a0 13 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBronk, 2009). This ideology constructs all modern knowledge as focused on \n\u2018rationality, validity, truth and objectivity\u2019 (Townley, 2008: 23). Actors are \nindividual mechanical atoms that can be unproblematically aggregated into \nwholes, unchanged when brought together.  Historical, political and national \nvariation are subordinated to notions of timelessness, controllability and \nuniversality.  Its logic of abstract deductivism seeks stylized general principles to \nmake sense of reality.  Motivation is governed by the calculus of utility-\nmaximizing behaviour rather than inspired by imagination, sentiment and \ncreativity. Modernity is both produced by and governed by a \u2018holy trinity\u2019 that \nincludes calculative rationality, methodological individualism and instrumental \ncausal relations (Townley, 2002a: 561). A managerial logic thus reflects this \nunderstanding of modernity while also providing an ideological basis for the \nvalues and technologies associated with scientific management.  \n If we were to accuse CDM of simply constituting another colonizing \ndiscourse (Cooke et al., 2008: 3), we might say that it portrays all development \nmaangement as governed by an institutionalized managerialist logic.7 This \nmanagerial logic expresses the theory of development management in terms of \nadministrative modernization and the practice of development management as the \napplication of abstract universal solutions to the problem of under-development.  \nThis singular representation of all management, including development \nmanagement, as managerial belies the existence and possibility of alternative \n\u00a0\n7 An institutional logic is both a practice governed by supra-organizational patterns of \nactivity and a symbolic system by which humans infuse activities with meaning \n(Friedland & Alford, 1991).\u00a0\n\u00a0 14 \nrepresentations that may be less destructive and insidious, even whilst such a \npossibility exists within critical management studies.  This dominant linguistic and \ndiscursive construction of management as managerial may occur to the detriment \nof empirical understandings of the actual practices and organizational contexts of \ndevelopment (Apthorpe, 1986: 377; Hardiman, 1987: 112).   \n What grounds are there to believe CDM has institutionalized a particular \nrepresentation of all development management as managerial? The \u2018new\u2019 \ndevelopment management recognises the connection and expansion of the \nadministrative modernization project of the colonial and post-WWII \ndevelopmentalist era (Cooke et al., 2008: 10).   A line of continuity is drawn \nbetween the aims of colonialism to bring modernization to \u2018natives\u2019 and those of \ndevelopment administration and development management that modernize \n\u2018countries,\u2019 their administrations and increasingly a variety of non-state actors in \nthe image of neo-liberalism (Cooke, 2003; Cooke, 2004). Modernizing \ninterventions that bring the poor into contemporary processes of globalization on \nthe grounds of the West\u2019s security are the ends of development management (de \nVries, 2008: 150).  The theory of modernization that underpins development \nmanagement is linked to a dominant conception of certain, causal and rational \nprogress towards modernity. \n Managerialism is also related to the manner in which administrative \nmodernization within development processes is supposed to be achieved. The \napplication of \u2018technocratic ideas and practices\u2019 promise control, stability and \nprogress for the development endeavour (Cooke et al., 2008: 6, 11).   Critical \n\u00a0 15 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nmanagement scholars describe this as an abstract form of management, by which \nis meant one that is disembedded and disembodied.  As a disembedded \ntechnocratic practice, management becomes a portable technology of control.  \nAbstract management is disembodied because it is divorced from an individual\u2019s \ndetailed experiences and\/or local knowledge. It places value on scientific \nneutrality and the pursuit of an efficient ordering of people and things so that \ncollective goals can be achieved, to the detriment of other values like loyalty, trust, \ndemocracy and morality (Edwards, 1998; Townley, 2001: 303-304).  Context and \nperson independent management can introduce distortions by simplifying and \nreifying highly complex processes in such a way that strips away nuance, \ndifferences in social context and political content.  \n Development management is a managerial endeavour then to the extent \nthat its concept of management borrows from Enlightenment intellectual \ntraditions.   While radicals construct development management in the image of \nrational science, there is a different theory and sociology of knowledge from \nwhich an alternative concept of management can draw (Townley, 2002a: 561). If \nmanagement is \u2018predicated on a very large story about social progress,\u2019 it is not the \nonly story of progress in town (Parker, 2002: 5).  The theoretical possibility of a \nnon-managerial development practice8 is opened up by the presence of another \nstyle of thinking about society existing since the Age of the Enlightenment, a \ncomplementary if opposing ideological force that does not privilege an exclusive \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n8\u00a0The term \u2018management\u2019 is so closely associated to managerialism that it perhaps \nobviates reference to a non-managerial development management.\u00a0\n\u00a0 16 \nunderstanding of management as managerial.  It is to this Romantic social \nideology that we now turn.   \nROMANTIC POSSIBILITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT \n It is noteworthy that one of the founding fathers of post-developmentalism \nrecognises that it is the underlying concept of modernity as rational science that \ncrafts a limited conception of development management (Escobar, 2008).   \nNevertheless, while CDM makes a name for itself by criticizing and \ndeconstructing the dominant Enlightenment understanding of modernity that \nsustains managerialism, a discussion of alternative modernities has been much less \ncentral to their exposition.  It is in this sense that CDM has presented a partial \nview of critical management studies as the latter has considered the possibility of \nan alternative modernity.   Barbara Townley, the noted critical management \nstudies scholar whom Cooke and Dar refer to in the first page of their book as \nsharing continuities with post-developmentalism, extensively entertains the \npossibility of an alternative modernity that underpins a more ethical management \n(Townley, 1999, 2002a, b, 2004, 2008). \n These two paradigmatic theories of knowledge are reflections of two \ndominant social ideologies\u2014Enlightenment and Romantic.  Romanticism has been \nposthumously identified as a loose collection of philosophical beliefs and artistic \ncreeds that while lacking a single essence, nonetheless share common associations \nthat celebrate the role of imagination, creativity and emotion (Bronk, 2009: 87).  \nRomanticism is both a product of reductionist Enlightenment thinking and a \ncritical response to its tenets, such that while we have come to see these ideologies \n\u00a0 17 \nas binary and conflictual, the possibility for their apposite use does exist (Bronk, \n2009).  All knowledge, including management knowledge, has \u2018unconsciously \nembedded\u2019 structures that derive from both Rationalism and Romanticism, where \neach social ideology provides a foundation and a resource for thinking about \nsociety (Bloor, 1991; Bronk, 2009; Townley, 2002a: 555).  Nevertheless, \ntheoretical distinctions and intellectual boundaries are drawn between narrow \nmodels of scientific explanation and rationality and more holistic, dynamic and \nindeterminate explanatory frameworks of Romanticism that culminate in a real \nschism that is still felt today (Bronk, 2009). So while modern management \nknowledge has tended to draw upon the rationalism of the Enlightenment, this is \nnot to say that Romanticism cannot still inspire a different ideological foundation \nfor development management as an embedded socio-political practice.  \n A Romantic social ideology is presented in its archetypical format with \nfour key methodological characteristics that rival those of Enlightenment thought \n(Bloor, 1991: 63-64; Bronk, 2009; Townley, 1999, 2002a, 2008). Unlike \nEnlightenment\u2019s reliance of mechanical metaphors, Romanticism borrows from \norganic metaphors where social wholes are not mere collections of atomistic \nindividual units but the result of local conditions and contexts that cannot be \naggregated. This dynamic understanding of the social world privileges locally \nconditioned variation of responses and adaptations anchored in concrete historical \nand political realities. Romantic social ideology rejects abstract principles and \nunderstandings in favour of concrete cases and embedded knowledges, \nacknowledging the inherently social and fragmentary basis of reality. Prescriptions \n\u00a0 18 \nit must recognise at least the p\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nand positions derive from in-depth understandings of facts but are also informed \nby pluralistic values and subjective descriptions.  Human motivations are informed \nby imagination and sentiment, where self-interest is overshadowed by motivations \nlike loyalty, trust and the pursuit of excellence. Overall, the methodological style \nof Romantic social ideology cultivates an understanding of modernity as a \ncontested goal who achievement derives from intricate, inter-connected and non-\nlinear processes lacking universally applicable answers to the practical and ethical \nproblems of life.  \nA Romantic understanding of modernity provides a basis for theorizing a \nnon-managerialist development.  While the Age of Enlightenment feeds the \ndominant contemporary construction of management as managerial, it is neither a \nsingular nor totalizing ideology.9  To some degree, CDM recognises that \nmanagerialism is simply one kind of \u2018representation of management as a neutral, \ntechnical means-to-an end set of activities\u2019 (Cooke, 2003: 48).  And yet, CDM\u2019s \ntendency is nonetheless to assume the governmentality of managerialist forms of \norganisation and control in development (Cooke et al., 2008: 6; de Vries, 2008: \n153). In doing so, it positions itself squarely in the camp of radicals that denounce \nand de-construct without proposing alternatives.  If CDM is truly attempting to \nbring the sub-fields of post-development and critical management studies together, \nossibility within the latter to theorize a non-\n\u00a0\n9 Enlightenment social ideology may be losing its relative dominance as advances in \nquantum physics robustly reject the potential for linear and predictable causal relations \n(Townley, 2002b).  In the social sciences, such theories have led to the growth of \ncomplexity theory, a body of scholarship that embraces the possibility of progress even in \nthe face of unpredictable, uncertain and ambiguous situations (Mowles, 2009; Mowles, \nStacey, & Griffin, 2008).  \u00a0\n\u00a0 19 \nmanagerialist development practice. Yet the question remains, what would such a \nnon-managerialist development practice look like?  With a reformulated Romantic \nunderstanding of modernity, we may yet open up a space to challenge the ends of \ndevelopment management as an unproblematic bureaucratic modernization and its \nmeans as disembedded and disembodied practice.   \n \nIMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT PRACTICE \n How do the methodological characteristics of Romantic social ideology \ninform a non-managerial development practice?  At a fundamental level, it \nunderstands administrative modernization as inherently pluralistic and political in \nnature and thus a site of contestation.  In a sense, this politicized understanding of \nall administration has now been accepted in public administration scholarship \n(Svara, 2001, 2006; Waldo, 1948), even if development managers have tended to \nassume the possibility of separating questions of administration from those \ninvolving politics.  Management always occurs in the fractured social orders of a \npolis (Friedland & Alford, 1991; Townley, 2002a: 568) and is always and \neverywhere a struggle for power, and thus a creature of politics.   To acknowledge \nthe politicization of development practice must move us beyond mere \u201creflective \nmodernization\u201d that reminds that development is a politically embedded process \nshaped by local political interests and influences (Bowornwathana, 2000; \nMcCourt, 2008; Unsworth, 2008, 2009).  In other words, development \nmanagement is more than ensuring embedded understandings of political \ndynamics for more efficient and effective planning.  It must also begin to see the \n\u00a0 20 \nmodernization project and its instruments as political creatures that sustain \nhierarchies, conflicts, resistances, disjunctures, inequalities and power \nasymmetries (Crewe & Harrison, 1998; de Vries, 2008; Mosse, 2005; Toner & \nFranks, 2006; Townley, 2001; van de Berg & Quarles van Ufford, 2005). To \nillustrate the weaker variant of this conception of politics in development \nmanagement, consider a recent World Bank evaluation of public sector reform \nprojects asks for greater \u2018realism about what is politically and institutionally \nfeasible\u2019 and recognises that \u2018technology is not enough by itself\u2019 (Independent \nEvaluation Group, 2008: xv-xvi). The World Bank\u2019s considers political context \nwithout an understanding of the ways their instruments of strategic planning and \ndiagnostics are political artifacts that may themselves contribute to the failures of \ncivil service reform, for example as a result of the uni-dimensional understanding \nof social reality they can capture.  A non-managerialist development practice must \nbe an exercise in activism that incorporates a more substantial notion politics, an \neffort to re-politicize all aspects of the modernization project without resorting to \nthe extreme CDM positions that simply denounce Western capitalist forces (de \nVries, 2008: 166; Edwards, 1998). A non-manageralist development practice it \nultimately a call to consider all aspects of development management in robust \npolitical terms. \n  A non-managerialist development practice will also sustain embedded and \nembodied practices.   An exclusive reliance on the abstract and universalist tools \nand techniques is rejected in favour of practical reason that is embodied in humans \nand contextually bound (Townley, 2002a: 568).  Practical reason borrows from \n\u00a0 21 \nAristotle\u2019s concept of phronesis that recognises a localized rationality and applies \nknowledge in concrete cases that deal with actual problems.  Practical reason thus \nstraddles Enlightenment and Romantic perspectives as it is oriented towards \ngetting things done, but also counter-balanced by a recognition that accomplishing \ngoals must encompass context, judgment, experience, intuition and common sense \n(Townley, 2008: 215).  A non-managerialist management is thus about coping \nwith daily situations and resolving mundane problems while still holding onto \nsome definition of purpose and final objectives or ends despite uncertainties, \nconflicts and contingencies (Blunt, 1997: 347; de Vries, 2008: 153; Parker, 2002: \n5-7, 183).  In this way, practical reason can construct unified pictures of the world \nguided by the general principles and norms emerging from what has gone before.  \nEmbedded knowledge and experience, working theories, and instrumental goals \nthus co-exist in this reconceived development management, in something that \napproximates a practical science of \u201cmuddling through\u201d (Joy, 1997; Lindblom, \n1959). \n Taking Romanticism to heart will require three things from development \nmanagement.  First, development management will need to become anchored in \nexperiential realities of all those involved in the planning relation (Townley, \n2008). Reducing the physical and psychological space between developers and \nthose for whom development is sought is one way to ensure this embeddedness. \nThis requires building organizations that support and value such experiential \nknowledge, for example ones that are deconcentrated, decentralized, smaller, \ndemocratic, more responsible and less bureaucratic. Creating all organizations in \n\u00a0 22 \nthe mirror image of private corporations does not recognize that humans can \ncoordinate their activities and achieve collective goals via a huge variety of \norganizations from chess clubs to virtual communities (Parker, 2002: 202-209).  \nDevelopment practice would then, perhaps, need a little more emphasis on \n\u201corganization,\u201d and a little less of an obsession with \u201cmanagement\u201d (Parker, 2002: \n10, 209).  Moving from the vocabulary of management to organization might \nthereby encapsulate greater sensitivity to the myriad of ways of coordinating the \ndevelopment endeavour, taking us beyond the universalist managerialist frame. \n Secondly, moving away from managerialism recognizes development \nmanagement as performance art, by which is meant an improvised, flexible, \ncontingent, intuitive and sensitive practice (Escobar, 2008). Imaginative \nreceptivity to unforeseen windows of opportunity, divergences and unexpected \nevents will also be called upon because of the uncertainty and unpredictability of \nconstructing casual connections in dynamic socio-political processes like \ndevelopment. For example, while contestation within the modernization process \nmay be predictable, the ends and the manner in which differences are negotiated \nwill have no obvious fixed or universal solution.  Ambiguity becomes the natural \nstate at the expense of fixed prescriptions and structures (Brinkerhoff & Ingle, \n1989; Bronk, 2009: 111). An uncertain and disorderly practice need not be feared \nfor its lack of coherence and closure but embraced as a source of creative and \nproductive solutions to the problems of under-development (Gulrajani, 2006; \nPritchett & Woolcock, 2004; Quarles van Ufford,Kumar Giri & Mosse, 2003). The \n\u00a0 23 \nresult is a development practice thus becomes an act of improvised political \nsteering rather than planned social engineering.    \n Finally, a Romantic conception of management will involve development \nactors considering their own problematic position within the development \nendeavour, as well as the limitations of the technologies and organizations at their \ndisposal.  Such professional reflexivity can hopefully reduce the triumph of \noptimism over good judgment, recognizing the ways in which the ways even well-\nintended actions and actors can maintain the structural and institutional conditions \nthat maintain under-development.  Cultivating discerning managers in \ndevelopment will require that planning process are continually revisited, revised \nand reexamined in a constant interaction between experience and strategy \n(Abbott,Brown & Wilson, 2007; Eyben, 2003; Mowles,Stacey & Griffin, 2008). \nThis can provide the basis for an \u201cemergent ethics\u201d as those involved in \ndevelopment at all levels reflect on their place in the contradictory social orders \nsustained by their engagement and consider how to advance cross-cutting values \n(Joy, 1997: 456; Quarles van Ufford,Kumar Giri & Mosse, 2003: 23; Townley, \n2008: 216).  \n  \nTHE DESIRABILITY OF A NON-MANAGERIALIST \nDEVELOPMENT  \n CDM is a relatively new and radical perspective on development \nmanagement.   By linking post-developmentalism to critical management studies, \nCDM highlights the inequality, violence and power of development management \n\u00a0 24 \nover subalterns in the Global South.  The hegemonic tendencies of development \nmanagement are thus made visible in such a way that a sense of complacency is \nnever allowed to emerge regarding its failings and its problems.  Like the post-\ndevelopmentalism that inspires it, the aim of CDM is largely to add to debate and \nput forward new ways of thinking, rather than to consider practical policy-based \nsolutions (Corbridge 2007: 199-200; Quarles van Ufford, Kumar Giri, & Mosse, \n2003: 11). As this article has suggested, however, the critical appraisal of \ndevelopment management may be unjustifiably one-sided.  Development practice \nneed not necessarily be constituted by the pernicious effects of managerialism. It is \nalso desirable that CDM begin to consider the possibility of a non-managerial \ndevelopment practice as this may go some way to resolving the fundamental \nradical\/reformist impasse that characterizes development management and \nhampers efforts to build a more ethically and politically engaged development \npractice. \n A non-managerialist development practice can incorporate the radical \ncritique of managerialism without abandoning the possibility of intervention in the \nname of social progress.   It can accept the limitations of development but also \nrecognise that achieving a post-development world is more utopic than feasible. \nUnlike CDM, a non-managerialist development practice does not dismiss the value \nof second best solutions, the world of practical policy-making and reformist modes \nof engagement.  It builds on radical understandings of development management, \nyet also moves debates forward in a critically constructive enterprise. This can \n\u00a0 25 \nincrementally, if imperfectly, build societies where equality, sustainability, \nempowerment and justice are all valued and cultivated.   \n Why is it important to hold onto the possibility of intervention in the space \nof international development?  For post-developmentalism and the radical CDM \nscholarship that is inspired by it, development is pernicious and needs to be \nrejected outright. Notwithstanding the force of this argument, the desirability of \nsuch nihilism needs to be questioned (Corbridge, 1998, 2007).  In the first place, it \nleaves radical development management at the level of a disengaged and de-\nconstructive critique that implicitly sustains the status quo of under-development \n(Pieterse Nederveen, 2001: 106).  Uncovering the hegemony of development \ndiscourse does not necessarily allow the poor to practically escape its power; more \noften it leaves them in an attenuated state of marginalisation with their dreams of \ndevelopment left unfulfilled (de Vries, 2008: 160). While CDM defends \ndeconstruction as a correction of sorts given the dominance of mainstream \nreformist thought in development (Cooke et al., 2008: 17), it explicitly shies away \nfrom theorizing different ways to address the real, practical and tangible \nchallenges of under-development. Its stated focus is exposing the violence and \npower of development management in order to open up spaces for dissent, give \nvoice and make the concerns of the poor visible (Willmott, 2008).  Critical \nanalysis is the format for CDM's \u2018permanent revolution' (Corbridge 2007: 200). \nYet, this critique does seem to come at the cost of both action and alternatives, \nthereby implicitly sustaining the conditions of under-development. \n\u00a0 26 \n An additional reason to consider the desirability of a non-managerial \ndevelopment practice derives from the fact that it can re-establish connections and \nredouble efforts to create plausible actions and practical alternatives across the \nradical-reformist spectrum.  Radical suspicion of all development interventions \ncurrently limits productive possibilities for recovery and reconstruction and thus \nsustains the fundamental cleavage characterising development management \n(Quarles van Ufford, Kumar Giri, & Mosse, 2003: 17).  A non-managerial \ndevelopment practice represents an opportunity to reinvigorate development \nmanagement scholarship into a critically reflective and politically engaged \nenterprise. This is not to say that radicals and reformists will necessarily see eye to \neye on every issue. Rather it suggests that we need to accept and embrace the \nnormality of tensions and disjunctures in development at all levels, including \namongst academics.  Development management needs to exploit these tensions by \ncreating meeting points for them and harnessing them as forces for \nexperimentation and productive creativity (van de Berg & Quarles van Ufford, \n2005; Pritchett and Woolcock 2004).  Without the reconstitution of development \nmanagement, the risk is that right-wing radical approaches that advocate the \nsubstitution of development with exclusively market solutions win the debate and \nactually worsen the status quo of under-development. \n Lastly and perhaps most importantly, the desirability of a non-managerial \ndevelopment practice derives from the fact that it embraces the principle of \nresponsible critique (Corbridge 2007; van de Berg & Quarles van Ufford, 2005: \n4).  This responsibility requires that criticism consider the consequences of \n\u00a0 27 \nthinking and acting in certain ways and take steps to mitigate the effects of the \nuncomfortable truths that are raised.   It is arguable that CDM represents an \nabrogation of this responsibility as it embraces reflection without action in such a \nway that actually preserves or deteriorates the conditions of under-development.  \nA non-managerial development practice is an attempt to bridge the worlds of \naction and reflection and begin the process of creating a language and mobilization \neffort underpinned by a global moral ethic. \n \nCONCLUSION   \n CDM has tended to equate development management to managerialism \nand reject the high modernism that underpins it.  This rejection provides the basis \nfor a contemporary debate between radical and reformist development \nmanagement scholars, a debate that has a longstanding history within the field that \nboth can and should be reconciled.  CDM has yet to consider a theory of \nalternative modernity that can sustain a different kind of development practice.  If \nwe accept an understanding of modernity derived from Romantic understandings \nof practical rationality however, we can robustly challenge an understanding of \ndevelopment management as straightforward modernization exclusively achieved \nvia disembedded and disembodied practice.  An alternative modernity is the basis \nupon which development can be undertaken as an ethical, experiential and \npluralistic political engagement.  Radical-reformist development practice is thus \nboth theoretically plausible and ethically desirable and can uncover new horizons \nfor both research and action in the sub-field now called development management.  \n\u00a0 28 \nIt can recognise the power and knowledge effects of development planning \nprocesses and simultaneously translate this knowledge into a commitment to \nreforms that can achieve greater equality, sustainability and justice.  It has the \npossibility to theorize alternative forms and formats of intervention that can \nembrace uncertainty, ambiguity and complexity and still maintain a moral and \npolitical commitment to ending under-development.  To be against managerialism \ndoes not require us to be against modernity, or indeed to be against development \nmanagement.    The future for development management can and should be  \nradically reformist.  \n\u00a0 29 \nREFERENCES \nAbbott, D., Brown, S., & Wilson, G. 2007. Development Management as \nReflective Practice.
