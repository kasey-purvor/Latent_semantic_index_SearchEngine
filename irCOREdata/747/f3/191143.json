Those with sufficient rotation\nform a centrifugally-supported torus whose collapse powers the GRB. We investigate\nthe role of tidal locking within a tight binary as a source of the necessary angular\nmomentum. We find that the binary orbit must be no wider than a few solar radii\nfor a torus to form upon core collapse. Comparing this criterion to the observed pop-\nulation of binaries containing two compact objects suggests that rotation may have\nbeen important in the formation of up to 50% of the observed systems. As these sys-\ntems created a neutron star and not a black hole they presumably did not produce\nhighly luminous GRBs. We suggest instead that they make the subset of GRBs in the\nrelatively local universe which have much lower luminosity.\nKey words: Gamma-ray bursts: compact binaries: supernovae\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe link between long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\nand stellar collapse is now firmly established (Woosley 1993;\nHjorth et al. 2003; Stanek et al. 2003). In particular long-\nduration GRBs appear to originate in type Ic supernovae\nand frequently in hypernovae (core collapse events with an\norder of magnitude more energy than classical supernovae).\nThe nature of the short duration (< 2s) bursts is far more\nuncertain, although their origin in populations of all ages\n(e.g. Gehrels et al. 2005; Berger et al. 2005; Prochaska et\nal. 2006) can be explained if they are caused by the final\nmerger of a tight binary system of neutron stars (NS) or\nblack holes (e.g. NS-NS, NS-BH). In addition to these two\nmain classes of bursts, which are distinguished primarily\nbased on their observed duration, there is also evidence for\nfurther subtypes. For example as well as the very energetic\nGRBs which originate from high redshifts (e.g. a mean red-\nshift of \u223c 2.8; Jakobsson et al. 2006) there is also a further\npopulation of low luminosity events which can be seen only\nin the relatively local universe. The prototype for this class\nis GRB 980425\/SN 1998bw (Galama et al. 1998) which oc-\ncurred only 35 Mpc away, while GRB 031203\/SN 2003lw (at\n\u223c 450 Mpc; Watson et al. 2004; Malesani et al. 2004) and\nmost recently GRB 060218\/SN 2006aj (at \u223c 130 Mpc; Mod-\njaz et al. 2006; Pian et al. 2006) also lie in this class. These\nlow luminosity events have isotropic equivalent luminosities\n\u22c6 E-mail: anl@star.le.ac.uk (AJL); mbd@astro.lu.se (MBD);\nark@astro.le.ac.uk (ARK)\nof only 1048\u221249 ergs compared with energies of up to 1054\nergs for the most luminous GRBs. Thus, while the number\nof observed systems is significantly lower, their space den-\nsity is likely to be much higher than for the more luminous\nbursts.\nRegardless of the object responsible for the GRB (e.g.\nNS-NS binary or collapsing star) the most popular model\nfor the creation of the burst is essentially the same - ex-\ntreme accretion rates on to a newly\u2013formed compact object.\nThis accretion is thought to be fuelled by a massive (0.1-\n10 M\u2299) torus which forms if the infalling material has too\nmuch angular momentum to accrete directly on to the cen-\ntral compact object. In NS-NS mergers, it is relatively com-\nmon for mergers to produce a torus (see e.g. Ruffert & Janka\n1999;Rosswog & Davies 2002). For massive single stars, it is\nnot clear whether sufficiently high central rotation rates may\nbe maintained to produce a torus on core collapse (e.g. Mac-\nFadyen &Woosley 1999;Petrovic et al. 2005), although it has\nbeen suggested that rapidly rotating metal\u2013poor stars can\nretain sufficient angular momentum (Yoon & Langer 2005;\nWoosley & Heger 2006). Alternatively, binary scenarios sug-\ngest a way of removing the envelope and providing a source\nof angular momentum (e.g. Izzard et al. 2004; Podsiadlowski\net al. 2004). We explore this mechanism further in this pa-\nper.\nSpecifically we examine the idea that the core of a mas-\nsive star may be spun up by tidal locking within a tight bi-\nnary. The necessary binary separations are a few solar radii\nor less. The hydrogen envelope of the massive star would\ntherefore have been lost earlier (probably in a common en-\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS\n2 A.J. Levan, M.B. Davies and A.R. King\nvelope phase). Systems sufficiently tight may undergo a fur-\nther period of mass transfer, similar to that seen in Cyg-X2\n(e.g. Davies, Ritter & King 2002). We subsequently examine\nknown compact binary systems (NS-NS, NS-WD) and con-\nclude that, at the time of the supernova, approximately 50%\nmay have been sufficiently tight to necessitate the formation\nof a disc.\nWe suggest that low and high luminosity GRBs may\nbe distinguished by the formation of either a NS (low lumi-\nnosity) or BH (high luminosity). The only compact object \u2013\ncompact object binaries discovered so far in the Milky Way\nconsist of neutron stars and white dwarfs. However similar\nsystems, with more massive cores could produce black holes,\nand thus luminous GRBs.\n2 EVOLUTIONARY PATHWAYS TO\nCOMPACT OBJECT BINARIES\nCompact binaries consisting of some combination of NS and\nBH, and possibly white dwarfs (WDs), can be formed via\na variety of channels (see e.g. Belczynski et al. 2002). The\nbasic scheme is shown in Figure 1, and is essentially the\nsame as that described in Bhattacharya & van den Heuvel\n(1991).\nThe route to forming the compact object binary is thus\na relatively close binary system. For the formation of a dou-\nble neutron star (rather than a NS-WD system) both com-\nponents must have M > 8M\u2299. The initially more massive\nstar evolves more rapidly, leaving the main sequence before\nits companion and, if the binary is sufficiently close, causing\na first incidence of conservative mass transfer. This phase of\nmass transfer may significantly increase the mass of the sec-\nondary (as was the case for J1141-6545 [Davies et al. 2002]).\nThe core of the primary continues to evolve to the point\nof core collapse and supernova explosion, producing either\na neutron star or black hole depending on its mass. Subse-\nquently the second star evolves off the main sequence. As the\nmass ratio at this point is large, the resulting runaway mass\ntransfer creates a common envelope in which the He core of\nthe secondary and the first neutron star inspiral due to the\nloss of orbital angular momentum and energy via dynamical\nfriction in the envelope. Eventually this envelope is removed\nand a He-star \u2013 NS system remains (i.e. the hydrogen has\nnow been removed from the system so the final SN is Type\nI).\nThe penultimate step in the evolution of compact bina-\nries is the evolution of the He star \u2013 NS binary. As the final\nprocess prior to the second SN, the evolution of the binary\nat this stage may have the largest impact on dynamics of\nthe SN upon collapse. In particular the angular momentum\nof the He-star largely dictates the formation (or not) of a\ndisc upon core collapse. We assume here that the binary is\ntidally locked at the end of the helium main sequence, this\nis reasonable since the timescale for synchronisation of the\norbit is less than the evolutionary timescale for the Helium\nstar (Hut 1981;Tassoul 1995). Given this, we then calcluate\nthe angular momentum content of the core at the time of\ncore collapse, as discussed in the next section. The evolu-\ntion of a He-star \u2013 NS binary has been investigated in detail\nby Dewi et al. (2002, 2003). For the very close binaries of\ninterest here the He star essentially always fills its Roche\nlobe, either on the helium main sequence or in the giant\nbranch. We use a simplistic model in which the subsequent\nevolution of the orbit is governed by three factors; i) in-\nspiral via gravitational radiation, ii) mass transfer and iii)\nmass loss via winds. Gravitational radiation always acts to\ndecrease the separation of the two components, while mass\nloss decreases the total mass of the system and may drive\nthe binary to wider separations. We do not consider the ef-\nfect of magnetic fields within the star, although they may\nact to slow the rotation (e.g. Petrovic et al. 2005). This\nmay occur since the core and envelope remain magnetically\ncoupled after the He main sequence, or because of angular\nmomentum loss via stellar winds flowing along the field lines\nwhile on the main sequence. The latter effect would be less\nnoticeable at lower metallicity and may explain a bias to-\nwards GRB in low metallicity environments (see section 7).\nThe effect of mass transfer when the He star overflows its\nRoche lobe can be more complex. Matter overflowing the\nRoche lobe falls onto the already formed neutron star and\nangular momentum may be ejected from the binary (e.g. via\na wind). However, if this material has low specific angular\nmomentum then the system can widen. Indeed, Dewi et al.\n(2002) find that for massive He stars (i.e. those that form\nneutron stars) the period typically increases through the He\nstar evolution. Alternatively, mass transfer from the He star\nmay result in the merger of the He star and the neutron star\nvia a delayed dynamical instability if the mass ratio is too\nextreme.\n3 DISCS AROUND NEUTRON STARS AND\nBLACK HOLES\nIn the general model discussed above, rotation is a crucial\ningredient in the production of a GRB. Too little rotation\nresults in the direct collapse of the progenitor star and will\npreclude the formation of a torus and thus of a GRB. Here\nwe assume that the material lying just outside the core must\nbe centrifugally supported upon collapse, in order to form\nan accretion disk outside the innermost stable orbit of the\nnascent black hole. This criterion can be expressed quan-\ntitatively as requiring that the specific angular momentum\nj of the material just outside the core exceeds\n\u221a\nDGMc\/c,\nwhereD is the radius of the orbit required for disk formation\nin units of Schwarzschild radii (GM\/c2) (e.g. the innermost\nstable orbit lies at D = 6, or \u223c 12 km for an 1.4 M\u2299 BH),\nMc and the core mass (Podsiadlowski et al. 2004).\nDiscs around neutron stars can be more difficult to cre-\nate, since young neutron stars can be markedly larger than\nthe canonical 10 km radius commonly assumed. Therefore\nthe disk must be formed at higher (\u223c 20\u221250 km) radius from\nthe newly formed NS. The creation of the disk at a larger\nradius thus requires greater angular momentum. If this re-\nquirement arises from a tidally locked binary, we can show\nthat this in turn demands a correspondingly higher orbital\nvelocity. We assume as described above that tidal locking\noccurs at the beginning of the Helium main sequence and\nthat, for the late stages of evolution of the He-star (i.e. in\nthe He giant branch) the core decouples from the envelope.\nIn this case, following Podsiadlowski et al. (2004) we can\ncompare the required angular momentum at the time of col-\nlapse with that at the edge of the iron core at the start of the\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\nNeutron star binaries and long duration gamma-ray bursts 3\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\nMS MS\nMS\nNS\/BH\nNS\/BH\nNS\/BH He\nSN\/GRB\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\nFigure 1. An evolutionary pathway to the creation of a binary\ncontaining a rapidly-rotating core-collapse supernova in a tight\norbit. The primary evolves first, possibly transferring material to\nthe secondary (stage 1). It then produces a neutron star (NS)\nor black hole (BH), when it explodes as a core-collapse super-\nnova (stage 2). The secondary then evolves, filling its Roche lobe\n(stage 3) and transferring material to the NS\/BH producing a\ncommon envelope phase (stage 4). The NS\/BH and He core of\nthe secondary spiral together ejecting the surrounding envelope\nproducing a very compact binary (stage 5). Tidal locking pro-\nduces a rapidly-rotating He star such that the rotation is signif-\nicant when the secondary explodes as a core-collapse supernova,\nwith a torus being formed around the central compact object by\ninfalling material.\nhelium main sequence, and, assuming tidal locking equate\nthis to an orbital frequency (i.e. \u03c9 =\n\u221a\nDGMc\/R\n2\ncc, where\nRc is the radius of the iron core).

We use here the models of\nHeger et al. (2002), the key parameters are Mc = 1.7 M\u2299,\nRc \u223c 0.1R\u2299, for a He star of mass 7.71 M\u2299, this yields a\ncritical separation of \u223c 3 R\u2299 for the formation of a disc at\nthe innermost stable orbit of a 1.7 M\u2299 BH.\n4 COMPARISON WITH KNOWN SYSTEMS\nWe have examined the distribution of separations for the\nknown compact binary systems (NS-NS or NS-WD) within\nour own Galaxy. These are shown in the semi-major axis \u2013\neccentricity plane in Figure 2. From the currently\u2013measured\norbital parameters it is possible to constrain the pre-\nexplosion parameters of each of the systems. The differ-\nence between the currently observed orbital parameters, and\nthose immediately prior to the SN comes from the inspiral of\nthe binary components via gravitational radiation and the\neffects of the kick imparted to the second NS at the time of\nthe SN. Both of these effects can be accounted for. Initially\nthe inspiral of the orbit can be extrapolated back to the\ntime of the second SN using the equations of Peters (1964)\nfor the time evolution of eccentricity and semimajor axis for\na binary. Secondly the range of pre-SN separations can be\nestimated, since, as the orbit is closed, the NS must return\nto the point in the orbit at which the SN occurred, i.e.\n(1\u2212 eSN)a < aSN < (1 + eSN)a, (3)\nwhere aSN and eSN represent the semi-major axis and ec-\ncentricity of the system, immediately after the second SN,\nas calculated by integrating the Peters (1964) relations back\nto the characteristic age of the recycled pulsar. The results\nof this are shown in Table 1, and demonstrate that only\nmodest evolution of the orbit has occurred.\nAs can be seen in Figure 2 a number of compact bina-\nries have separations which are sufficiently close that, upon\ncollapse material may have been rotating too rapidly to fall\ndirectly onto the nascent NS and thus it is expected that a\ndisc will have formed. This represents roughly 50% of the\nobserved population of compact binaries, and the relevant\nsystems are tabulated in Table 1.\nHowever, there are reasons to suspect that this measure\nof the fraction of compact binaries forming discs may be\nan underestimate. For example population synthesis mod-\nels (e.g. Belczynski et al. 2002) show that a large fraction\nof double neutron star binaries form with orbit separations\n\u226a 1R\u2299 and subsequently have merger times of < 106 years.\nThis population is under-represented in current pulsar sur-\nveys since their short lifetimes bias against their discovery\neven though (by number formed) they may be the dominant\npopulation. Such NS-NS binaries must at the time of forma-\ntion of the second NS have had separations small enough to\nmeet the criteria described above, and it is thus reasonable\nto suspect that disc formation should have occurred in each\nof these systems at the time of core collapse.\n5 NS-NS BINARY FORMATION AND LOW\nLUMINOSITY GRBS\nFigure 2 clearly shows that, at the time of core collapse, sev-\neral of the observed NS-NS binaries were sufficiently close\nfor centrifugally supported discs to form.

The three\nvertical lines represent the critical separations necessary at the\ntime of core collapse for a centrifugally supported disc to have\nformed at a distance of 6M, 20M and 50M from the newly formed\ncompact object, based on the models of Heger et al.

Approximate local rates of different events related to\nGRBs including Low Luminosity GRBs (LLGRBs - Liang et al.\n2006) and short GRBs (SGRBs - Nakar et al. 2005). The rates\nhave been taken (or derived) from Podsiadlowski et al. (2004),\nKalogera et al. (2004), Belczynski et al. (2002) and Cappellaro et\nal. (1999)\ncommonly thought to originate from similar discs surround-\ning black holes, it is interesting to investigate whether SN\nproducing discs around newly-formed neutron stars may\nalso produce some form of GRB. The maximum energy\nreleased in the accretion of the torus is given by E =\nGMns\/bhMacc\/Rns\/bh, or Ens = 3.6 \u00d7 1053(Macc\/M\u2299) ergs,\nfor a 1.4 M\u2299 NS and Ebh = 1 \u00d7 1054(Macc\/M\u2299) ergs, for\nany mass BH (since Mbh \u221d Rbh).\nThe extrapolation from disc accretion to gamma-ray lu-\nminosity is far from trivial since it requires an assumption\nabout the conversion of accretion luminosity into \u03b3-ray en-\nergy. One plausible mechanism of providing this energy is via\nneutrino-antineutrino annihilation. If this is assumed to be\nthe energy source then the accretion energy can be related\nto the observed gamma-ray energy via several efficiency fac-\ntors which account for the conversion of accretion energy to\nneutrinos, the cross section for neutrino - antineutrino anni-\nhilation, the subsequent fraction of energy that is transferred\ninto a baryon free jet, and finally the fraction of this energy\nwhich is emitted as gamma-rays (Oechslin & Janka 2006).\nFollowing Oechslin & Janka (2006) we assume that the prod-\nuct of the these efficiencies is \u223c 10\u22123. Thus the observed\nluminosities of low luminosity GRBs of 1048 \u2212 1050 ergs can\nbe explained by the accretion of 0.01 < (Macc\/M\u2299) < 0.3\nof material from the disc.\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\nNeutron star binaries and long duration gamma-ray bursts 5\nThere is, of course, a fundamental limit to the mass\nwhich can be accreted onto a NS without the consequent\naccretion induced collapse (AIC) of the neutron star on to a\nBH (e.g. Dermer & Atoyan 2006). Roughly speaking if the\nNS mass exceeds \u223c 3 M\u2299 then a BH forms. The masses\nof the neutron stars seen in NS-NS binaries are typically\nclose to 1.4 M\u2299 (q \u223c 1), so accretion from the disc has\nnot added dramatically to the mass. We therefore suggest\nthat the result may have been a GRB with a low luminosity\nof 1048 \u2212 1050 ergs. These systems may therefore be the\nprogenitors of the nearby population of long duration GRBs\nwith lower energies but significantly higher space densities.\nAs described above, the final step in the formation of a\nNS-NS binary is the collapse of either a helium or carbon-\noxygen core of a massive star in a type Ib\/c supernova.\nSuch supernovae only represent a fraction 15% of the to-\ntal core collapse SN population (Podsiadlowski et al. 2004),\nand those in tight binary systems only a small fraction of\nthese \u2013 approximately 3-10 % based on the ratio of SN Ib\/c\nto compact object \u2013 compact object binaries formed (Bel-\ncyznski et al. 2002)1 However, it is worth noting that the\npathway to NS-NS production described in this paper and\nthe creation of a long-duration GRB both require an SN\nIb\/c event (e.g. Hjorth et al. 2003; Pian et al. 2006).\nFrom observations of the (relatively small) number of\nlow luminosity GRBs observed to date their local space den-\nsity is estimated as 700+1400\u2212500 Gpc\n\u22123 yr\u22121(Soderberg et al.\n2006) and 522 Gpc\u22123 yr\u22121(Liang, Zhang & Dai 2006). This\ncompares with a rate a local rate of NS-NS mergers which\nlies in the range 200-3000 Gpc\u22123 yr\u22121 (Kalogera et al. 2004;\nNakar et al. 2006), although significant uncertainties remain\nin the derivation of each of these rates it is likely that there\nare sufficient compact binaries (NS-NS, NS-WD, BH-NS,\nBH-BH) systems to explain the population of low luminos-\nity GRBs.\n6 HIGH MASS ANALOGUES AND\nCOSMOLOGICAL LONG GRBS\nThe observed compact object \u2013 compact object binaries in\nthe Milky Way consist either of WDs or NSs. No BH-NS or\nBH-WD or BH-BH systems are known. However, it is ex-\npected that they are formed in moderate numbers; they are\nsimply harder to detect compared to NS-NS systems which\nhave been found via the radio emission from the recycled\npulsars. BH-BH systems can be formed via the same chan-\nnel as that shown in Figure 1 but with initially higher main\nsequence masses. In the common model for the creation of\nGRBs a nascent BH at the core of the massive star is es-\nsential. Thus, more massive versions of the systems which\nformed the observed NS-NS binaries are candidates for the\nformation of classical long-duration GRBs.\nIn this context it is reasonable to examine the parameter\nspace which may allow the formation of a rapidly rotating\nblack hole within tidally locked binary systems. In partic-\nular, for two massive stars, both of which create a BH we\n1 Note: this is formally a lower limit on the ratio of binary to\nsingle SN Ib\/c, since a fraction of NS-NS binaries are disrupted\non formation of the second NS. This fraction is likely to be small\nfor very tight binaries but larger for wider systems.\nwish to know whether both of the SN could plausibly pro-\nduce a GRB or if the presence of a compact object prior to\nthe GRB forming SN aids the production of GRBs.\nFigure 3 shows constraints on the radius of the sec-\nondary object such that it remains within its Roche lobe\nat the critical orbital separation. If both the He star and\nthe companion overflow their Roche lobes then a further\ncommon envelope results, and the most likely scenario is\na merger of the He star and the companion. For this con-\nstraint to be met the radius of the secondary must be & 1\nR\u2299. Thus only low-mass main-sequence stars could remain\nwithin their Roche lobes in these binaries. However, should\nthe companion be a compact object (BH or NS) at the time\nwhen the progenitor He star enters the He main sequence\nthen the evolution will proceed as described in section 2. In\nthis scenario it is worth noting that the creation of a BH-\nBH system can aid the production of a GRB in two further\nways. Initially the critical rotation periods can be attained\nat larger separations for more massive companions. In ad-\ndition, mass transfer from the star is less likely to lead to a\ndelayed dynamical instability when the secondary is a black\nhole. This is because the mass ratio is lower with a more\nmassive black hole companion rather than a neutron star.\nIn some cases, when either the mass ratio is too ex-\ntreme, or the He \u2013 NS\/BH separation is too small following\nthe common envelope, the binary may merge (e.g Fryer &\nWoosley 1998), such cases can also plausibly create GRBs by\neither accretion onto the BH in He \u2013 BH systems (Fryer &\nWoosley 1998), or by merger of two He stars if the masses are\nsufficiently similar (Fryer & Heger 2005; Dewi et al. 2006).\nGiven that under our criteria a reasonable fraction of the\nobserved systems would have formed a disc it appears un-\nlikely that all binaries with sufficient angular momentum for\nGRB production undergo such mergers.\n7 DISCUSSION\nSeveral lines of recent evidence have pointed to a preference\nby GRBs for host galaxies of low metallicity (Fynbo et al.\n2003; Fruchter et al. 2006; Stanek et al. 2006). In contrast the\nsystems observed in the Milky Way presumably formed at\nhigher metallicity (probably \u223c Z\u2299). However, one may ex-\npect that similar systems form GRBs more readily in lower\nmetallicity environments, due largely to the effects of mass\nloss on the evolution of the binary. Mass loss from both stars\non the main sequence will drive the binary to wider orbits,\nreducing the fraction of binaries which come into contact\nat any stage and also those which are sufficiently tight for\ndisc formation upon core collapse. Additionally, mass lost\nby the Helium star on its main sequence is lost along the\nmagnetic field lines and carries matter to large radii, losing\nangular momentum from the stellar core and braking its ro-\ntation. At lower metallicities the low mass loss rates thus\nfavour more rapid core rotation. Finally, mass loss from the\nindividual stars can dictate the remnant left (NS or BH).\nIn lower metallicity environments the lower mass loss rates\nthus leave the binary in a closer orbit, and with more mas-\nsive stellar cores, which collapse to form BHs. Thus lower\nmetallicity will favour the production of GRBs, in agreement\nwith observations.\nOne consequence of a supernova within a close binary\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\n6 A.J. Levan, M.B. Davies and A.R. King\nFigure 3. The maximum separation allowed for binaries contain-\ning a helium core of a massive star, as a function of secondary\nmass, such that core collapse of the helium star leads to the for-\nmation of a torus of material around the central core, assuming\nthat the system is tidally locked. The Roche lobe radii for the two\nstars are also shown. As can be seen, main sequence stars with\nradii > 1R\u2299 cannot fit within their Roche lobes, and, assuming\nM \u221d R this sets a mass limit of \u223c 1 M\u2299 on the mass of a main\nsequence companion. However, should both stars overflow their\nRoche lobes a common envelope would follow and, most likely the\nresulting system would merge.\nis that the outflowing supernova ejecta must pass the older\nNS. For close binaries the density at the radii of the NS\nis moderately high and thus, even though the velocity of\nthe ejecta can be very high the Bondi\u2013Hoyle accretion rate\nmay be significant (see e.g. Broderick 2005). Accretion on to\nthis object may provide a additional source of energy, and\nthus lightcurve variability, in any SN\/GRB formed via this\nchannel.\nIt is interesting to note that in this model some of these\nsystems can create both a long and a short GRB, with the\nshort burst occurring some time (< 108 years) after the long\nburst. We note that the NS-NS systems discussed here are\ndistinct from those found in globular clusters, which have\nbeen suggested as short GRB progenitors (Grindlay et al.\n2005), since NS-NS systems in globular clusters are formed\ndynamically and not by the channel described here.\n8 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have examined the role of tidal locking in a tight bi-\nnary system and its implications for the formation of a\ncentrifugally-supported torus upon core collapse. By exam-\nining the distribution of separations of known compact ob-\nject binaries (NS-NS, NS-WD), we conclude that up to \u223c\n50% of the systems could, at the time of the second super-\nnova, have been sufficiently rapidly rotating to create a torus\nupon collapse. We subsequently investigated the implica-\ntions of these observations for the formation of GRBs. None\nof the observed systems contain a BH, which is thought to\nbe essential to the formation of the highly luminous GRBs.\nWe suggest that higher mass analogues of the observed sys-\ntems can form GRBs, but that the collapse of less massive\nstars leading to neutron stars might result in a lower lumi-\nnosity GRB, similar to those that have been observed in the\nlocal universe.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the referee for a very helpful report.
