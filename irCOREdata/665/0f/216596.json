Mathews\nIndigenous community leaders and conservationists in Oaxaca, Mexico, believe that deforestation\ncauses streams to dry up and threatens rainfall, authorizing popular mobilizations against industrial\nlogging. This belief was produced by a combination of indigenous beliefs in nature spirits and early-\ntwentieth-century state-sponsored desiccation theory, which was brought to the Valley of Mexico in\nthe 1920s. Desiccation theory acquires political significance because it allows rural people to build\npolitical and epistemic alliances that bypass industrial forestry institutions and find sympathetic\nurban audiences and environmentalist allies, undermining state claims to reason and scientific au-\nthority. These alliances require the skillful translation and mistranslation of local environmental\nconcerns by activists and conservationists, who link the concerns of urban audiences with those of\nrural people. Popular beliefs about climate and forests in Mexico structure the authority and credibility\nof the state and will powerfully affect efforts to protect forests to mitigate climate change.\nASTROV: Man is blessed with intellect and creative powers,\nso that he might enhance that which he is given.

(Chekhov 2002 [1899], 25)\nWhen there is enough forest the winds lift up the clouds\nin their due time, and it rains, but when one ridge has\ntrees and one has been converted to desert, the clouds pass\nby, you see the water come but it doesn\u2019t rain there, and\nwhen it rains it rains very little and the soils are eroded,\nhuman lives, homes and goods are lost; also, it rains when\nit shouldn\u2019t.

Rural and urban people have come\nto share ways of describing environmental degradation, al-\nlowing environmental activists such as Rodolfo Montiel2 to\nexplain their hostility to logging in terms that urban and\ninternational audiences find comprehensible and sympathetic.\nHow have rural people been able to appropriate a language\nof environmental degradation and access to knowledge of the\nnatural world that urban and international audiences find so\ncompelling? In this paper I argue that although opposition\nto logging has many components, including its apparent de-\nstructiveness,3 it is concern over the links between defores-\ntation and climate change that has unified these disparate\nactors. The theory that deforestation causes declines in rainfall\nand streamflow, the drying up of springs, and disastrous\nflooding, which was a globally traveling scientific theory dur-\ning the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries\n(Saberwal 1998), has come to be part of popular beliefs about\nnature, cementing political alliances across enormous divides\nof livelihood, culture, and place.

Most ecologists and foresters believe that logging can be sustainable,\nbut in Mexico, as in many other countries, it has come to be popularly\nseen as uniformly destructive.\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n76 Current Anthropology Volume 50, Number 1, February 2009\nstate in order to justify government control and regulation\nof forests, pitting the state against the livelihood practices of\nrural people. Other environmental discourses continue to de-\npict rural Mexicans as the authors of environmental destruc-\ntion, as when rural people are represented as ignorant and\nenvironmentally destructive fire setters (Mathews 2003). How\nthen has the belief that deforestation causes climate change\ncome to be so different? Why have rural people been able to\nmake use of this theory as agents who can build alliances\nwith outsiders rather than as the subjects of state projects of\ngovernmentality and control of natural resources?\nIn this article I will describe how the internationally cir-\nculating scientific theory of desiccation was brought to Mexico\nin the early twentieth century and how it was used to drive\nstate efforts to control forests and people, first in the Valley\nof Mexico and then in the southern state of Oaxaca. Desic-\ncation theory was official science, justifying the Mexican state\nas the controller of reason and knowledge of forests, which\nwere represented as being degraded by the irrational rural\npoor. State science gave access to knowledge of nature in the\nform of forests, streams, and climate, while it asserted the\nability of the state to restore and manage nature. Before the\narrival of state desiccation theory and industrial forestry in\nthe 1930s, the Zapotec indigenous people of the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez\nof Oaxaca had quite a different understanding of nature and\nof forests and streams. They believed in nature spirits who\nhad to be placated, and they made little mention of environ-\nmental degradation. Over the course of the twentieth century,\nthese beliefs in nature spirits have been submerged by nar-\nratives of environmental degradation, and desiccation theory\nhas been appropriated as part of a powerful popular scientific\nbelief deployed in political conflicts over forests. Indigenous\nbeliefs in nature spirits did, however, create powerful asso-\nciations between mountains, streams, and forests, so that the\nplaces where forests are now protected for water are the same\nplaces once associated with the supernatural spirits who con-\ntrolled rain and water.\nIn the 1940s, the Mexican state turned decisively away from\ndesiccation theory in favor of concerns over soil erosion,\nflooding, and large-scale watershed protection. Rural people\nand, later, urban environmentalists have continued to believe\nthat deforestation causes climate change and, especially, that\nit causes springs to dry up and rains to fail. Environmental\nscientists no longer believe most elements of desiccation the-\nory, leading to a clash in beliefs between scientists and their\nstate sponsors on the one hand and popular audiences on\nthe other. It is this tension between governmental and ver-\nnacular belief that has made a broad-based popular opposi-\ntion to logging both thinkable and practicable; this movement\nhas succeeded in bypassing the spatial and conceptual au-\nthority of state forestry institutions, building conceptual and\nmaterial linkages between streams, forest landscapes and log-\nging practices, global environments, and urban water supplies.\nDesiccation theory has come to provide a relatively stable\n\u201cboundary object\u201d (Star and Griesemer 1989; Tsing 2005)\nacross the social worlds of urban audiences, conservationists,\nand rural people, allowing unlikely alliances between urban\nelites, environmental activists, and rural people who otherwise\nmight have little in common.\nThese forms of nature are not just \u201clocal\u201d\u2014on the contrary,\nlike other localisms, they are engaged in producing other\nscales, from regional to global (Tsing 2000). It is precisely the\nability of desiccation theory to make links with other scales\nand audiences that stabilizes relatively vague popular beliefs\nabout tree cutting, streams, and climate. Desiccation theory\ntherefore bypasses the scales and forms of authority and\nknowledge authorized by state forestry institutions. It is the\npossibility of building links with other scales, natures, and\ninstitutions that allows popular theories about forests and\nwaters to make imaginative and normative connections with\nglobally threatened climates and degraded urban environ-\nments. This connection making in turn allows intermediaries\nsuch as environmentalists and indigenous activists to engage\nin translations and mistranslations that link forests to waters\nin ways that elude the grasp of state institutions.\nSummary of Desiccation Theory\nAt this point it is appropriate to outline classic desiccation\ntheory and to emphasize that most environmental scientists\nnow disagree with many or all of its predictions (FAO 2005).\nSomewhat confusingly, desiccation theory links deforestation\nnot only to declining rainfall and streamflow but also to the\nopposite problem of torrential floods caused by soil-filled\nstreams. The three main predictions of desiccation theory are\nthat deforestation will (1) cause rainfall decline, vaguely stated\nas being at local, regional, or larger scales; (2) reduce stream-\nflow in the dry season; and (3) cause soil erosion, which will\nclog streams and cause flooding in the rainy season. A recent\nliterature review by the eminent tropical hydrologist L. A.\nBruijnzeel expressed considerable skepticism about each of\nthese three theses (Bruijnzeel 2004).\nThe weakest thesis is the link between deforestation and\nrainfall. Although some computer models suggest that large-\nscale deforestation may cause declining rainfall, most models\nhave assumed total deforestation replaced by bare soil,\nwhereas replacement of forests with grasslands would cause\nonly a relatively modest rainfall decline of around 8%, greatly\ndiminishing the likely impact of deforestation. In relatively\nrare montane cloud forest types, up to 60% of precipitation\nmay come from \u201cfog stripping,\u201d i.e., from condensation onto\nthe leaves and branches of trees (Ataroff and Rada 2000;\nCavelier and Goldstein 1989). This may be one of the few\ncases where deforestation would cause a reduction in effective\nprecipitation, but it would not apply to the vast majority of\nMexican pine-oak forests.\nRegarding impacts of deforestation on streamflow, the sit-\nuation is less clear; in general, deforestation increases water\nyield and streamflows because trees pump water into the\natmosphere, reducing the flow of water into streams or\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMathews Forests and Waters 77\ngroundwater. However, where logging operations damage the\nsoil severely, the infiltration and storage capacity of soil could\nbe permanently reduced, resulting in long-term streamflow\ndeclines. These processes are not well understood and are the\nsubject of current research, but they appear to depend greatly\non soil and subsoil type and on logging techniques.\nFinally, deforestation can cause streams to be filled with\neroded soil, which can in turn cause flooding, but the amount\nof erosion depends greatly on local ecology, logging condi-\ntions, climates, soil types, and the timing of rainfall events.\nIn any case, the greatest cause of flooding from storm events\nis the underlying soil type rather than the forests themselves:\nforests cannot absorb the intense rainfall events that produce\nmost floods (this is contrary to the largely discredited \u201cforest\nas sponge\u201d thesis advocated by many environmentalists).\nThis brief summary of desiccation theory and relationships\nbetween forests and waters cannot do justice to this complex\nand hotly contested field: interested readers may turn to re-\nview articles by Bruijnzeel (2004), Calder and Aylward (2006;\nsee also Forsyth and Walker 2008, 87\u2013116). For the present,\nwhat is of interest is not so much the empirical validity of\ndesiccation theory but the dramatic tension between the opin-\nions of officials, environmental scientists, and popular au-\ndiences in Mexico.\nContemporary Debates about\nDesiccation Theory\nTheories about relationships between forests and climate are\nancient, reaching back to ancient Greece (Grove and Rackham\n2001), but desiccation theory became a coherent modern sci-\nence only during the eighteenth century (Grove 1995). Des-\niccation theory circulated globally and was hotly debated dur-\ning the nineteenth and much of the twentieth centuries\n(Andre\u00b4assian 2004; Fairhead and Leach 2000a; Grove 1995;\nSaberwal 1998), forming one of the main environmental ra-\ntionales for modern forest management (Rajan 2006). More\nrecently there has been a vigorous critique of the empirical\nbasis for desiccation theory and of the negative impacts of\nthe environmental policies it has been used to justify (Calder\nand Aylward 2006; Forsyth and Walker 2008). Various aspects\nof desiccation theory have come to play an important role in\nthe politics of nature in places as far-flung as India and Nepal\n(Ives and Messerli 1989), Thailand (Forsyth and Walker 2008),\nand Central America (Kaimowitz 2004). In each place, one\nor another aspect receives more weight; at times it has justified\nstate control (India, Thailand, Central America), while at oth-\ners it unites popular opposition to logging, as in Mexico.\nThe persistence of desiccation theory cannot be explained\nby an appeal to the empirical observation that rainfall in-\ncreases at higher elevations, where forests are often also found,\nor indeed, by an appeal to the collective experience of drought\nor deforestation. On the contrary, a well-understood principle\nof science studies emphasizes that beliefs in empirical facts\nabout the world must be explained not by appeal to how good\nthe data are empirically but by a symmetrical use of socio-\nlogical and natural scientific data (Bloor 1991 [1976]). There\nis, after all, much knowledge about nature that does not com-\nmand widespread assent; what needs to be explained is why\nthis set of facts has come to be socially accepted. Accordingly,\nin this essay I describe how desiccation theory has gained its\nauthority in contests between scientists, officials, and rural\npeople, and I ask what implications this has for our under-\nstandings of environmental politics.\nThe Setting\nIn 2001 I stood in a meeting hall in the town of Ixtla\u00b4n de\nJua\u00b4rez, a Zapotec indigenous municipality in the state of Oa-\nxaca in Southern Mexico. I had come to present the results\nof my research on the history of logging, agriculture, and\nforest fires to a dozen community leaders. This forest history\nwas of consuming interest to my audience; a shared experience\nof working for and struggling against a logging concessionaire\nhad united the community, and the now-independent com-\nmunity logging business was the main support of the town\neconomy. Many of these elders had told me on other occasions\nof the deep sense of anger they felt about the degradation\nand \u201cirrational\u201d tree cutting by the timber company, which\nthey felt had \u201ctaken the best\u201d of the forest. Community mem-\nbers incorporated this narrative of environmental degradation\nin their claims for autonomy from the Mexican state. My\nintervention therefore encountered a landscape layered with\nmeanings: of warfare, mining, industrial logging, and, most\nrecently, community forestry and conservation (Mathews\n2003). During the course of the meeting, an important topic\nof conversation was a recent outbreak of pine beetles in an\narea of watershed protection forest. Community leaders feared\nthat cutting and removing diseased trees could threaten town\nwater supplies, but they were also concerned that the outbreak\ncould spread:\nComunero: How much would it affect that area, where there\nis that disease? We all know that this is the area of the springs.\n. . . We decided in an assembly that that area could not be\ntouched, above all to protect the layers of water. How much\nwould it damage [the water supply] to attack this outbreak\n[of pine beetle]?4\nMy friend Mart\u0131\u00b4n Go\u00b4mez, a research biologist employed\nby the Mexican government, replied that this dilemma had\ncome up in several nearby communities.\nGo\u00b4mez: What must be done? Obviously, even if there is a\n[community] regulation or agreement that these areas have\nto be kept forested, those damaged trees will have to be\nremoved. . . . There are certain myths about the areas of\n4. Sound recording, Ixtla\u00b4n de Jua\u00b4rez Oaxaca, July 1, 2001.

Community members\n(comuneros) firmly believed that this logging ban protected\nwater supplies, as did their careful protection of streamsides\nin other, logged parts of the forest. Go\u00b4mez was politely con-\ntradicting a deeply held belief\u2014which he called a \u201cmyth\u201d\u2014\nabout forests and logging.\nHis audience was similarly polite\u2014a few minutes later the\nelder Epifanio Perez thanked Go\u00b4mez and me profusely for\nour expertise and then told a story that undermined our\ndefense of logging by insisting on local knowledge and agency.\n\u201cKnowledge is not just cutting trees,\u201d he said, recounting the\nrole of a community leader in insisting on protecting streams\nwhen logging began in 1948. \u201cThat was the situation that I\nlived,\u201d he said, \u201cand I interpret very well what you tell us.\u201d\nPerez was not against logging per se, but he insisted on com-\nmunity knowledge, and he was politely criticizing our expert\nauthority. How did this difference of opinions between con-\nservative community leaders and outside experts such as Go\u00b4-\nmez and me arise? Why did locals so tenaciously and politely\ndefend environmental theories that were contrary to the ac-\ncepted scientific point of view? And how did they feel au-\nthorized to contest the authority of science?\nHow has this belief come to be so firmly held? Part of the\nanswer lies in the way that desiccation theory provides a way\nto link local environmental concerns to larger scales and to\nfaraway places, providing apparently remote forest commu-\nnities with a way to criticize state power and to seek out allies\namong urban audiences in Mexico City and Oaxaca.5 As a\nformer mayor of Ixtla\u00b4n told me a year later:\nPeople say that there is no more water, but I don\u2019t agree\ncompletely, because here, where we have taken care of the\nforests, it carries on raining, as here [in Ixtla\u00b4n] where the\nrains have been good. On a world level, the water is finish-\ning, on a world level, but not here, because we have cared\nfor our forests; maybe in other places the water is finishing,\nbut not here.6\nGraciano Torres creatively linked community protection of\nIxtla\u00b4n\u2019s forests with the preservation of local climate, point-\nedly comparing the negative effects of global climate change\nwith the benign effects of local control of forests, repeatedly\nemphasizing community members\u2019 technical knowledge of\nforestry. Ixtla\u00b4n\u2019s leaders have continually made use of their\nclaim to protect water, winning national and international\n5. Desiccation theory is also important in intracommunity politics, as\nit can be used to control the authority of \u201cscientific\u201d or development-\noriented community elites who seek to exploit forests.\n6.

How did globally circulating desiccation the-\nory come to allow moments of alliance between urban and\nrural people in early twenty-first-century Mexico? How did\nthe well-intentioned Doctor Azov, the environmental activist\nRodolfo Montiel, and the mayor of Ixtla\u00b4n come to share a\nbelief that forests produced rainfall? What does this mean for\nour understandings of local agency before apparently au-\nthoritative scientific discourses? I suggest that it is by a close\nstudy of the practices of state making and the construction\nof authoritative knowledge that we can understand the ways\nin which institutions push new theories about nature on the\nsubjects of rule, how these theories come to be added to\npreexisting understandings of place and landscape to help\nform new identities, how new forms of nature and landscape\nare produced, and how these understandings of place and\nnature can produce new identities, new practices, and new\nnetworks of alliances that can bypass or penetrate the state.\nMuch recent theorizing on the nature of state power has\nhinged on the insight that the state is fragmented and often\nconflicted and that the unity of the state is itself an ideological\nconstruct deployed by powerful elites. This directs attention\nto the concrete institutions that assert rule, underlining the\nmateriality and coercion of state domination (Abrams 1988).7\nSimilarly to Abrams, Foucault focused on widely spread tech-\nniques of power\/knowledge rather than on the structure of\nthe state (Gordon 1991). This critique has shifted the ana-\nlytical focus to the mundane \u201ceveryday forms of state for-\nmation\u201d described by Joseph and Nugent (1994). Attention\nto the mundane practices of state making also allows a focus\non connections between the documentary and discursive ex-\nercise of bureaucratic power and deep cognitive structures\nsuch as national identity and kinship (Herzfeld 1992).\nAttention to the micropolitics of state making has been\nparticularly fruitful in the field of studies of governmentality,\nfocusing on the ways in which a constellation of discourses,\ninstitutions, and practices leads to the formation of new sub-\njectivities (Rose 1999); in the environmental field, Arun Agra-\nwal (2005) has traced the formation of environmental sub-\njectivities in the Indian state of Kumaon over the past century,\nand Sivaramakrishnan (1994, 2003) has shown how state the-\nories of natural resource management were transformed by\nlocal practices of rule in rural Bengal.

This is paralleled by theories of artic-\nulation that point to the relationship between official dis-\ncourses that find subjects who can then make political claims\nbased on new identities (Li 2000).\nThese approaches provide a good model for the ways in\nwhich rural people in the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez and elsewhere in Mex-\nico have come to see themselves as both subjects and op-\nponents of state-sponsored environmental degradation. This\nnew identity and set of political practices has been produced\npartly in response to the environmental degradation rhetoric\nproduced by the state and the forest service, partly in response\nto practices of state making through forestry regulations and\nstate forestry institutions and partly through the experience\nof working as employees of logging companies (Mathews\n2003). However, this governmentality literature often over-\nemphasizes the power of traveling discourses and underem-\nphasizes the materiality of power and the material resistance\nof the natural world. In the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez, a key element in\ncontests over forests is the materiality and coercive power of\nthe state: governmentalizing discourses require concrete in-\nstitutions and practices if they are to produce new identities,\npolitical practices, and forms of knowledge.\nWhat is required to make sense of these official projects of\ngovernmentality, then, is an emphasis on the power of state\nactors to apply coercion to back them up; thus, political eco-\nnomic inequality and state violence are implicated in projects\nof domination, discourse alone is insufficient to inculcate state\nideologies, and practices of domination must be substantiated\nethnographically (Moore 2005; Sivaramakrishnan 2003). This\nemphasis on coercion and on political economy and culture\narises from the various currents of scholarship that derive\nfrom the work of the Marxist scholar Antonio Gramsci\n(2001), leading historians and anthropologists to consider\nwithin the same framework both domination and resistance,\ncomplicity and co-option, and elite and popular culture\n(Moore 2005; Roseberry 1994). These approaches take seri-\nously the cultural work required to produce state power, the\nmaterial and coercive practices, official rhetorics, discourses,\nand representations that are required to produce the state idea\nand make it, even if only momentarily, believable.\nScience, State, and Nature\nAs suggestive as this is, the literature on state making pays\nrelatively little attention to the importance of nature in prac-\ntices of state making (for a rare exception, see Sivaramak-\nrishnan 1994) nor to how representations of nature come to\ngain cognitive, political, and material power. This is surprising\nas ideologies of reason, science, and nature protection are\ncentral to the rhetorical presentation of modern states (see\nalso Scott 1998). It therefore becomes critically important to\nunderstand how reason and the production of scientific\nknowledge are implicated in the production of political order.\nA number of scholars of science and technology studies (STS)\nhave argued that the authority of scientific knowledge is linked\nto that of the state through practices of public reason, ex-\npertise, and witnessing (Jasanoff 2005; Shapin and Schaffer\n1985) and that the boundary between science and nonscience\nis itself contested, shifting, and culturally produced (Gieryn\n1995), so that boundary-making practices are critical to as-\nserting the contours of the state itself. The idea of the state,\nwhich is the product of so much work, therefore also contains\nunderstandings about reason and science that are used in\nattempts to produce political order.\nThese arguments have resonance with environmental an-\nthropologists, who have long drawn attention to the ways that\nencounters with nature produce political and social identities\nand how representations of nature and people can come to\ngain political or social power (Dove 1983); however, they have\nbeen perhaps more concerned with the assertion of state or\nscientific discourses of nature (Fairhead and Leach 2000b)\nthan with how people contest, subvert, or evade these official\nrepresentations. How, then, can local environments and\nknowledges be brought within the same frame of analysis as\napparently authoritative global sciences? A possible analytical\nframework comes from the school of actor-network theory\n(ANT); the best known of these theorists is Bruno Latour.\nANT theorists emphasize the materiality of scientific knowl-\nedge: the documents, graphs, instrumental observations, rhe-\ntorical strategies, and visual technologies and how the cir-\nculation and translation of these representations produces\nauthoritative knowledge (Latour 1990). ANT approaches em-\nphasize the materiality of knowledge and make clear that\nscience and technology provide alternative bases for authority\nbeyond the state itself. Nevertheless, in some ways, earlier\nformulations of ANT substituted the structurally unified state\nwith a unified actor-network, without ever explicitly con-\nfronting the role of state power in stabilizing scientific knowl-\nedge or the normative and political conflicts that exist within\nnetworks (Jasanoff 2004a, 21). The recent literature on state\nmaking suggests a way out of this dilemma. Just as dissolving\nthe unitary state allows us to see the diverse array of perfor-\nmances, institutions, rhetorics, coercions, and representations\nthat go into producing state power, so too does dissolving\nthe overly structural aspects of ANT allow us to look less at\nthe network and more at the nodes, at the places and moments\nwhere the network is performed, where facts about nature\nand its human allies are made manifest. These are the \u201car-\nticulated assemblages\u201d described by Donald Moore (2005),\nwhere various visual technologies, institutional power, ma-\nterial objects, discourses, and identities are brought together\nto make places. Crucially, the theories and practices through\nwhich places are made also produce different natures\u2014place\nmaking is a kind of production of nature.\nMore flexible and performative understandings of ANT and\nof state help make sense of how rural people in Mexico have\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n80 Current Anthropology Volume 50, Number 1, February 2009\nFigure 1.

Forests have become a political\nand experimental space for producing knowledge and political\nalliances that can reach urban and international audiences.\nGovernments and foresters may seek to control the practices\nand understandings of rural people through the science of\nforestry, but scientific theories are very poor at specifying\ndetailed local practices of producing technology, as traveling\nscientific theories are transformed by local practices, alliances,\nand interests (Pinch and Bijker 2002). Further, the resistance\nof nature to human intention itself becomes a material and\nsymbolic resource for the comuneros of the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez, who\nhave produced new kinds of natures by logging forests, mark-\ning trees, and protecting community water supplies.\nBackground: History of Forest\nManagement in Mexico\nAt present, as over the past century, the vast majority of\nMexico\u2019s industrial timber has come from pine species that\ngrow in the temperate climates along the principal mountain\nranges (see fig. 1). Most of these forests passed into the hands\nof rural, mainly indigenous communities in several waves of\nland reforms during the 1930s and 1970s (Klooster 2003),\nresulting in a level of community title to forests that is unique\nin the world (Bray et al. 2003). Although forest land theo-\nretically belonged to rural communities, from the 1940s to\nthe 1980s the federal government awarded de facto control\nover commercially attractive forests to private and then na-\ntionalized logging companies. In the 1980s, broad-based op-\nposition to logging caused the government to cancel logging\nconcessions and give forest communities the right to manage\ntheir own forests, so that, at present, forest communities em-\nploy foresters to write and implement forest management\nplans and exercise varying degrees of control over forest in-\ndustrialization (Bray et al. 2003). Forest communities in Mex-\nico have attracted international interest for their sustainable\nforest management practices and relative stability, and a num-\nber of leading communities have been able to incorporate the\nconcepts of industrial forestry into traditional communal gov-\nernance systems (Alatorre Frenk 2000; Antinori 2000; Ma-\nthews 2003).\nBringing Desiccation Theory to Mexico\nThe Valley of Mexico is a high-altitude \u201cisland\u201d of relatively\nfavorable climate, surrounded by forested mountains to the\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMathews Forests and Waters 81\neast, south, and west and by semiarid areas to the north. The\nenvironment of the Valley of Mexico has been the subject of\nextensive manipulations as far back as the pre-Hispanic era,\nwith the building of extensive dikes to prevent floods and to\nprovide water for the \u201cfloating island\u201d chinampa agriculture\n(Whitmore and Turner 2001). Repeated floods during the\ncolonial and national periods inspired centuries of attempts\nto drain the lakes, a project that was finally completed in 1900\nand that resulted in the disappearance of much of the lake\nof Mexico (Connolly 1997). Paradoxically, removing excess\nwater immediately created excess dryness; the recently drained\nlake beds were alkaline and uncultivable, and dust storms\nbecame a serious problem. This environmental history gave\nMexican natural scientists and intellectuals an interest in cli-\nmactic and environmental change as far back as the sixteenth\ncentury (Musset 1991) and made them all the more receptive\nto the desiccation theories of the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies. The dramatic environmental changes of the late\nnineteenth century, with the rapid urbanization and indus-\ntrialization of the Valley of Mexico, presented the spectacle\nof massive state projects of environmental control and of local\ndesiccation and deforestation, producing the Valley of Mexico\nas a site of environmental degradation and of state control.\nBy the late nineteenth century, a group of engineers, me-\nteorologists, and scientists based in Mexico City were con-\ncerned about the impact of deforestation on climate, water\nsupplies, and flooding. The leading light of this circle was the\nwealthy engineer Miguel Angel de Quevedo.8 During 40 years\nof publication and advocacy, he produced a coherent scientific\ndiscourse of public reason and of environmental degradation,\ndeploying visual representations of degraded landscapes and\npoor farmers to represent the Valley of Mexico as degraded\nand in need of restoration and protection (de la Vega 1933;\nQuevedo 1926a, 1926b, 1933), advocating for rational, tech-\nnical, scientific management. Quevedo (1935 [1910]) was par-\nticularly concerned about the negative effects of deforestation\non climate and water supplies, but he also warned of the\nnegative psychological and physical effects of deforestation on\nurban residents, arguing for the creation of parks and green\nspaces. Quevedo and his associates believed that poor peasants\nwere converting forest lands to agricultural uses on slopes so\nsteep that the soil would soon be washed away. Between 1900\nand 1940 they produced a coherent narrative of environ-\nmental degradation through deforestation and desiccation,\nblaming this degradation on the ignorance of rural people\nand arguing that state intervention and modern science were\nrequired to restore and protect the environment. Through\nskillful performances of public reason and rural ignorance,\nQuevedo and his circle linked policies of state environmental\ncontrol to the concerns of urban audiences about the envi-\nronment of Mexico City and the Valley of Mexico, linking\nthese places to remote and uncontrollable rural people.\nThis campaign resulted in a new forest law in 1926 that\n8. See Simonian (1995) for the life and work of Quevedo.\nasserted the right of the federal government to regulate for-\nestry activities on both private and communal lands (Calva\nTellez et al. 1989). As desertification and desiccation were\nsome of the principal justifications for the law, streamsides,\nwatersheds, and areas near cities were particularly protected,\nand in these areas only marked trees were supposed to be\ncut. Enforcement efforts gradually spread from Mexico City\nto the provinces; as we shall see in the case of Oaxaca, forestry\nofficials were usually located in state capitals and restricted\ntheir efforts to controlling firewood cutting and logging in\nthe immediate vicinity.9\nWith the presidency of La\u00b4zaro Ca\u00b4rdenas (1935\u20131940), pro-\ntection of forests took on national importance. In a radio\nspeech to the nation in 1935, Ca\u00b4rdenas announced that forest\nresources were necessary for national economic development\nand that forest protection could restore climactic equilibrium\nand the flow of streams and springs (Ca\u00b4rdenas 1935). Ca\u00b4r-\ndenas appointed Quevedo to be head of the autonomous\nDepartment of Forest, Hunting, and Fishing, where he ini-\ntiated a program of tree planting and public education. How-\never, Quevedo\u2019s principal efforts were concentrated on fire\nsuppression, the establishment of protected areas, and logging\nregulations (Calva Tellez et al. 1989; Quevedo 1938). He se-\nverely restricted logging in many parts of the country through\nthe creation of forest protection zones, e.g., the forests of the\nValley of Mexico (1933) and the watersheds of irrigation pro-\njects in the whole country (1934), while he promoted the\nexample of model management plans, as at Atlamaxac in\nPuebla (Trevin\u02dco Saldan\u02dca 1937), which visually depicted a leg-\nible and controllable nature (Scott 1998). These initiatives\naimed to produce and control new places such as model for-\nests, streamside protection areas, and degraded lands. The\ncultural representation of the state as the source of order and\nscience required the production of eminently local natural\nobjects, mostly in the Valley of Mexico and neighboring states.\nQuevedo\u2019s attempts to enforce forestry regulations and\nlimit agricultural expansion soon encountered opposition\nfrom the ministry of agriculture and from the agrarian reform\nmovement. In 1940 Ca\u00b4rdenas closed the Department of For-\nestry, Fish, and Game and transferred responsibility for forests\nto the Ministry of Agriculture. Subsequent to Quevedo\u2019s loss\nof power, desiccation theory was attacked by agronomists\nwhose central focus was agriculture and who supported land\nreform and agricultural development (Contreras Arias 1950a,\n1950b). From the 1940s onward, the principal role of forests\nbecame erosion prevention and flood control, and desiccation\npassed from being a theory that justified state control to a\npopular environmental theory used by rural communities to\nprotest industrial logging and find allies among urban\naudiences.\n9. However, see Boyer (2007) for an account of Quevedo\u2019s efforts to\nset up forestry cooperatives in Michoacan.\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n82 Current Anthropology Volume 50, Number 1, February 2009\nTranslating Urban Nature to the\nCountryside: Bringing Forestry\nand Desiccation Theory to\nOaxaca, 1922\u20131956\nFederal forestry officials began to apply forestry regulations\nover firewood sales in markets immediately around the city\nof Oaxaca in the early 1920s.10 With modestly increasing man-\npower, they attempted to control industrial logging in the\npine forests to the north and south of the city during the\nearly 1930s but were frustrated by limited resources and local\nopposition. The material impact of official fire control and\nlogging regulations was therefore largely restricted to urban\nfirewood markets and forest communities immediately\naround the city of Oaxaca. Broadly speaking, the detailed\nforestry regulations issued by Quevedo and his successors in\nMexico City were unenforced and unenforceable. The ideo-\nlogical impact of official environmental theories and forestry\nregulations was much more powerful; through contact with\nforestry officials and state rituals of tree planting, forest com-\nmunities learned that cutting trees could dry up springs and\nthreaten the climate, that selective logging would protect for-\nests, and that forest fires were officially forbidden. Rival com-\nmunities increasingly began to use accusations of clear-cutting\nand illegal burning to involve the state in long-standing land\ndisputes.\nThe Oaxaca State Archive (Archivo General del Estado de\nOaxaca [AGEO]) contains many cases where one community\naccuses another of setting fires, either deliberately or through\ncarelessness, and complains that this will threaten water sup-\nplies. A typical example is the case of San Pedro Teococuilco,\nwhich was accused of burning forests on its boundaries with\nSan Juan Guelache, San Miguel Etla, and San Gabriel Etla\n(Lopez Cortes 1930). The forestry department sent a letter to\nthe municipal authorities of Teococuilco, telling them to cease\nburning because they were not supposed to convert forests\nto agricultural uses, as this would \u201csurely damage the springs\nin this region.\u201d Another case arose between La Trinidad and\nXiacui, near Ixtla\u00b4n (Various 1945). Xiacui accused La Trinidad\nof \u201ccutting immoderately\u201d and of setting fires that were a\nthreat to the water supplies of the hydroelectric plant at La\nNatividad. In these and other cases, the negative effects of\ncutting trees on streams and climate were a key justification\nfor forest protection. Contemporary Oaxacan newspaper ac-\ncounts universally condemned deforestation because of its\neffect on rainfall (Anonymous 1959; Conzatti and Bradomin\n1953 [1913]), and forest communities seem to have adopted\nthis theory quite rapidly, both because it was politically useful\nin getting the state to intervene in intercommunity conflicts\n10. This section draws on the Archivo General del Estado de Oaxaca\n(AGEO), contemporary newspaper accounts from the state newspaper\narchive, the Hemeroteca Estatal de Oaxaca (HEO), contemporary eth-\nnographic data, and oral histories I collected in Oaxaca and the com-\nmunity of Ixtla\u00b4n de Jua\u00b4rez in 2000\u20132001 and 2008.\nand because it accorded with their own theories about the\nrelationship between forests and climate.\nZapotec Environmental Beliefs and the\nArrival of Industrial Logging\nThe indigenous people of the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez (see fig. 2) brought\ntheir own understanding of forests and landscapes to their\nencounter with the forest service and the logging companies.11\nBecause the introduction of industrial forestry had such an\noverwhelming effect on local people\u2019s understandings of the\nforests, it is impossible to reconstruct from present-day in-\nterviews exactly what serrano beliefs about forests and agri-\nculture were before the arrival of state-sponsored forestry in\nthe 1930s. However, Julio de la Fuente\u2019s (1949) classic eth-\nnography Yalalag: Una Villa Zapoteca Serrana contains de-\ntailed accounts of Sierra Zapotec understandings of agricul-\nture, forests, and climate immediately before the arrival of\nindustrial logging, strongly suggesting that present-day beliefs\nin desiccation and environmental degradation are the product\nof encounters with logging and state desiccation theory.\nDe la Fuente (1949, 256\u2013266, 303\u2013308) tells us that cere-\nmonies to ask for rain were already a dim memory when he\ncarried out his fieldwork in 1937\u20131941. He found that people\nhad a vague belief that witches could ask for rain by carrying\nout ceremonies near springs high in the mountains and near\ncarved stones associated with pre-Christian \u201cidols.\u201d12 High\nand forested places were inhabited by the supernatural lord\nor lords of the mountains (duen\u02dcos del cerro), who could be\nassociated with good crops, rain, witchcraft, or good luck.\nSprings (manantiales, ojos de agua) and waterfalls were both\nappropriate places to ask for rain, because they connected\nwith places inside or above the earth. Human intervention\nsuch as charcoal burning could anger the earth, so ceremonies\nhad to be carried out in the mountains13 to placate super-\nnatural entities. This suggests a concept of human society as\nseparate from a powerful nature that could punish trans-\ngressions but also that such punishments could be avoided\nby rituals that placated natural forces through the consump-\ntion of food and drink and perhaps also by sacrifices of an-\nimals. The association between water and the spirits of moun-\ntains, springs, and caves continues to be widespread across\ncentral Mexico (Glockner 1999; Goloubinoff, Katz, and Lam-\nmel 1997; He\u00b4mond and Goloubinoff 1997; Rivera Flores and\nPourrut 1997; Villela F. 1997), while weather prediction prac-\ntices are apparently examples of syncretism of Spanish and\npre-Hispanic beliefs about climate.\nThe meticulous detail of de la Fuente\u2019s ethnography allows\n11. Local environmental theories are themselves the product of the\ncenturies-long encounter between indigenous and Spanish theories about\nenvironment and health.\n12. That is, with remnants of pre-Colombian settlements, which are\nscattered throughout the Sierra.\n13.

It is\nhighly significant that although people told de la Fuente that\nthe rains were not as regular as formerly, they did not attribute\nthis to the effects of logging or deforestation. Possibly they\nstill believed that nature spirits and their management were\nmore important than secular events such as logging. By com-\nparison, at present in Ixtla\u00b4n everyone except elders told me\nthat deforestation could cause climate change by reducing\nrainfall. They were less sure that rainfall declines had actually\ntaken place in the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez, but they were deeply con-\ncerned that springs (manantiales) might dry up if nearby\nforests were logged.\nAt present, for most people in Ixtla\u00b4n rainmaking rituals are\na distant memory; however, in interviews with four elders in\nthe community of Ixtla\u00b4n in 2008, I heard consistent accounts\nof former rainmaking rituals. They told me that until the late\n1940s, when rains failed, believers from the community would\nlead a pilgrimage from the town church to an area of springs\ncalled Los Pozuelos (little wells), near a small lagoon on a\nmountainside far above the town. Don\u02dca Pe\u00b4rez told me:\nThey would go out from the church singing, praying [to\nthe Pozuelos, to the lagoon]. They would do their ritual.\nThat is where they asked for water. I don\u2019t know with what\nprayers the ritual was done, but they would come back\nsinging, and halfway down, the drizzle would start. By the\ntime they were back in town, the water [rain] had arrived.14\nWhen I asked Pe\u00b4rez why people thought the climate was\nchanging, her reply summarized the divergent views of com-\nmunity members and suggested the effect of outside ideologies\non understandings of nature:\nIt depends upon whom you ask. We ancianos [elders] say\nit is because of the will of god. Younger people say it is\nbecause trees have been cut. Others say it is because of the\nozone layer.15\nPe\u00b4rez also suggested that climate change was due to the\nreligious and moral failings of the younger generation, coming\nclose to a view of nature as powerful and depending on moral\nbehavior rather than the nature degraded by logging described\nby working-age people.\n14.

This statement resonates with a study by Lazos and Pare\u00b4 (2000),\nwho found that older Nahua indigenous people in a community in Ve-\nracruz were more likely to believe that degradation was the result of\nimproper relations with nature spirits and that nature was too powerful\nfor humans to degrade it. Younger people were more likely to attribute\ndegradation to deforestation and saw nature as threatened, suggesting\nthat belief in the fragility of nature is the product not only of environ-\nmental degradation itself but also of the cultures of modernity and\nprogress.\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n84 Current Anthropology Volume 50, Number 1, February 2009\nAlthough rainmaking rituals are no longer practiced in\nIxtla\u00b4n, they appear to be widespread in other communities\nin Oaxaca and may motivate local defense of forests. Similarly\nto the Sierra Zapotec described by de la Fuente in the 1930s,\nrainmaking rituals are currently carried out in caves and\nsprings and on mountains in the nearby Valles Centrales re-\ngion (M. Rees, unpublished manuscript). In the summer of\n2008, the president of San Baltazar Loxicha, a community\nsouth of Oaxaca, told me that people continued to carry out\nrainmaking rituals in his town; I also heard of continuing\nrituals in the community of Jaltianguis, close to Ixtla\u00b4n.\nWatershed Protection and Industrial Logging\nBetween the late 1940s and the late 1980s, the forests of the\nSierra Jua\u00b4rez largely ceased to be linked to rainfall decline\nand water supplies: the Mexican state instead constructed\nforests as the subject of industrial logging and large-scale flood\nprotection. Industrial logging was organized through conces-\nsion of logging rights over 139,000 ha of community forests\nto a logging company, FAPATUX (1956). Significantly, FA-\nPATUX documents make no mention of desiccation theory,\njustifying industrial logging on grounds of national economic\ndevelopment and the need to prevent soil erosion and forest\ndestruction caused by indigenous farmers (FAPATUX 1956,\n11\u201312). The other state environmental agency present in the\nSierra Jua\u00b4rez was the Papaloapan Commission (Comisio\u00b4n del\nPapaloapan), which sought to prevent downstream flooding,\nfirst by banning all private logging and then through the\npromotion of soil conservation practices such as contour\nplowing and terrace building. Like FAPATUX, the Comisio\u00b4n\nwas concerned with controlling soil erosion so as to prevent\nfloods, and official documents make no mention of the effects\nof forests on streamflow, springs, or rainfall (Comisio\u00b4n del\nPapaloapan 1965; Tamayo 1982 [1954]).\nBetween 1956 and the cancellation of the FAPATUX timber\nconcession in 1983, serranos learned the techniques of in-\ndustrial logging, gradually mastering the use of trucks,\nwinches, and chain saws and ultimately training community\nmembers to take on forest management responsibilities. It is\ntelling of the discursive shift in official representations of the\nenvironment that protests against the logging company turned\nfrom the accusations of burning, illegal logging, and climate\nchange prevalent during the 1930s to protests over labor con-\nditions and rates of pay during the 1960s and 1970s. The\nlimited documentation shows contending parties referring to\nforests as economic resources and makes little mention of\nstreams, springs, or climate (Autoridad Municipal of Yavesia\nand Others 1970; Various 1957, 1970). Similarly, during the\nfinal struggle to cancel the logging concessions (1980\u20131983),\nabundant newspaper reports and documents published by\nallies of the forest communities made no mention of streams\nor climate, denouncing the logging companies for pillaging\ntimber and paying community members poorly (Anonymous\n1983a, 1983b; Leon 1983; Martinez Luna 1977; Ortega Pizarro\nand Correa 1983).\nMembers of forest communities now recall industrial log-\nging as illegitimate and violent, and present-day narratives of\nenvironmental degradation and threatened streams convey\nsome of this sense of immorality, injustice, and violence.\nThroughout the FAPATUX concession period, the various\nstate agencies responsible for forests continued to emphasize\nerosion prevention and flood control rather than the protec-\ntion of water supplies, as reflected in the forest management\nplans applied first by FAPATUX and then by the community\nitself (from 1983 onward). Partially as a result of pressure\nfrom environmentalists during the 1980s, biodiversity and\nwatershed considerations came to have increasing impor-\ntance, but desiccation theory was never officially supported.\nWhen Ixtla\u00b4n commissioned its first management plan in 1993\n(TIASA 1993), the plan contained detailed classifications of\nwatersheds and soil erosion potential. As recounted to me by\nseveral people in 2008, it was the community that decided to\nprotect 723 ha of forest specifically in order to protect the\ntown water supply\u2014something not considered in the plan\nitself.\nThe Underground Streams Resurface:\nPresent-Day Cultural Politics of\nForests and Waters in Oaxaca\nThe pine and pine-oak forests of the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez are owned\nand logged by forest communities that are currently a global\nflagship of sustainable community forestry, supported by two\nconsecutive World Bank projects, and widely considered to\nbe one of the best examples of community forest management\nin the world.\nForest Management in Ixtla\u00b4n\nI spent much of the summer and fall of 2000 in Ixtla\u00b4n, ac-\ncompanying forestry technicians and loggers to the forests\nand interviewing community leaders and elders in the town\nof Ixtla\u00b4n. At this time, the community logging business of\nIxtla\u00b4n employed a forester and several forestry technicians, a\ndozen two-man logging crews, and machine operators and\nworkers in a timber processing complex and a small furniture\nfactory. This industrial complex employed around 170 people\nout of a total population of around 2,000 and drew on around\n10,250 ha of commercial pine forest out of the 19,000 ha of\ncommunity forests (TIASA 1993).16 Community members I\ntalked to regarded the forestry business as legitimate because\nit was the main economic support of the town, but a signif-\nicant number were concerned that logging could threaten\nbiodiversity and the town water supply. Community members\n16.

This was not the\nsame area as the Pozuelos, where rainmaking rituals used to\nbe carried out, and none of the half a dozen younger forestry\ntechnicians mentioned nature spirits or indigenous knowl-\nedge; rather, they saw this as a technical decision that had\nbeen made by their seniors. The community elders I talked\nto about forests and waters similarly never referred to nature\nspirits; although they recalled former rainmaking rituals at\nthe Pozuelos, they justified forest protection on technical\ngrounds. The closest of my older informants, Zenaido Pe\u00b4rez,\nwas a devout Catholic who described the rainmaking rituals\nas superstition and justified the eventual decision to log wa-\ntershed forests on technical grounds.17 Even an elder who\nbelieved in the effectiveness of rainmaking rituals explained\nthe protective effect of trees in secular terms, telling me that\nwatershed forests were protected because the shade of over-\nhanging oak branches prevented them from being dried up\nby the sun.18 The springs that provided the main town water\nsupply were high on the mountainside to the northwest of\ntown. No one mentioned any religious associations with this\narea, and the former connection of supernatural entities with\nmountains, caves, streams, and springs appeared to have been\nalmost completely submerged beneath more recent layers of\nenvironmental theories. Nevertheless, the shared memory of\npredatory logging and environmental degradation, the asso-\nciation of forests and water with high places and springs, and\nthe belief that logging should be controlled to protect water\nsuggest that folk and state environmental theories have linked\nthe observation that rainfall increases with altitude with places\nconnected with water, forests, and springs.\nGeneralized concern over water supplies continues to be\nthe most likely reason to block logging: conflict over the log-\nging of the watershed protection forests in 2005\u20132006 caused\ndeep internal dissent. Following orthodox environmental sci-\nence, the then\u2013community forester tried to convince the as-\nsembly that selective sanitation logging would have no effect\non water supplies, that trees \u201csucked\u201d water rather than at-\ntracting it, as desiccation theory predicted. As recounted to\nme in 2008 by various participants in this controversy, op-\nponents of logging sought support from foresters and biol-\nogists within the community, seeking the authority of global\nscience in order to question the technical knowledge of the\ncommunity forester and the economic power of the prol-\nogging faction. Although the watershed forest was eventually\n17. Interview notes, Ixtla\u00b4n, August 7, 2008.\n18. Interview notes, Bulmero Pe\u00b4rez, Ixtla\u00b4n, August 7, 2008.\nlogged, the authority of the forester was gravely undermined,\nand he was dismissed in 2007. Community members felt able\nto question the technical knowledge of outsiders (the forester\nwas not from Ixtla\u00b4n) by appealing to technical knowledge of\ntheir own and by finding scientist allies.\nContemporary Politics of Forests and Waters in Oaxaca\nBy 2000\u20132001, the theory that forests protected water supplies\nand could affect rainfall was widely shared in the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez\nand the city of Oaxaca, allowing forest communities to build\ndiscursive alliances with urban audiences and institutional\nalliances with environmentalists. A good example of this is\nthe case of the forest community of Yavesia, about an hour\u2019s\ndrive from Ixtla\u00b4n, which made use of desiccation theory to\nbuild an antilogging alliance with environmental NGOs in\nOaxaca. During my time in Oaxaca, I became friendly with\nmembers of the environmental NGO Sierra Norte A.C., which\nwas composed of a small group of idealistic young biologists\nwho were opposed to logging and were trying to sponsor\nforest protection and ecotourism. I spent much time dis-\ncussing forest protection and logging with Sergio, a young\nbiologist who worked for Sierra Norte A.C. Sergio saw all\nlogging as suspect (on one occasion he told me that the only\nhonest forester he knew was the community forester of\nIxtla\u00b4n), and he believed that deforestation had profoundly\ndesiccated the climate of Mexico, including the Valley of Oa-\nxaca. Sergio and his friends at Sierra Norte A.C. advised the\nnearby community of Yavesia in a series of petitions against\nthe logging of its forests, helping community leaders to frame\ntheir opposition to logging in terms of biodiversity protection\nand prevention of climate change (Autoridades Comunales\nde Yavesia 1999).\nThe community of Yavesia has been trying to remove its\nforest land from an unusual pooled ownership structure since\nthe 1950s19 and, especially, to secede from a communal logging\nbusiness that many people from Yavesia see as corrupt and\nenvironmentally degrading.20 In a series of documents pre-\npared with the assistance of Sierra Norte A.C. and presented\nin a public forum in 2001, Yavesia accused the logging busi-\nness of threatening water supplies, rainfall, and streams. The\naccusations were well designed to appeal to urban audiences\nin Oaxaca. Yavesia\u2019s leaders claimed that these forests were\nvaluable as a source of biodiversity and water and that de-\nforestation would reduce rainfall and threaten the city of Oa-\nxaca (Municipio de Santa Maria Yavesia 1999). The belief that\nthe forests of Yavesia were critical to the water supply of the\ncity of Oaxaca was shared by urban environmentalists present\n19.

Interview notes, Leo Schibli, SERBO, Oaxaca, January 8, 2001.\n22. SEMARNAP is the Secretaria de Medio Ambiente, Recursos Natu-\nrales y Pesca. After 2001 this became SEMARNAT, the Secretaria de Medio\nAmbiente y Recursos Naturales (Ministry of Environment and Natural\nResources).\n23. The conflict between Yavesia, Lachatao, and Amatlan continues to\ntake surprising twists, with contending parties making creative use of\nenvironmental language and seeking outside allies (see Poe 2006).\nAs in many other cities in Mexico, water supplies in Oaxaca\nare a constant concern, and communities around the city of\nOaxaca often play on the presumed influence of their forests\non urban water supplies, allowing rural communities to build\nalliances with urban audiences. People in Oaxaca were well\naware of this long-standing connection between forests and\nwater: the principal water supply for the town came from the\ncommunity of San Felipe del Agua, which has historically also\nbeen a firewood and charcoal supplier to the city market.\nAlthough most of my fieldwork concerned forestry officials\nand rural people, numerous conversations with people living\nin Oaxaca revealed a widespread belief that the climate had\nchanged, perhaps as a result of logging and deforestation,\nperhaps due to pollution. At a national level, the strength of\npopular belief in the relationship between forests, rainfall, and\nwater supplies has forced officials to emphasize the link be-\ntween forests and rainfall in public declarations and policy\ndecisions, even as government scientists no longer believe that\nthis is correct. This can be seen in material produced by the\nCruzada Nacional por los Bosques y el Agua (Crusade for For-\nests and Water) of the Fox administration of 2000\u20132006 (SE-\nMARNAT 2006) or the more recent decision to pay forest\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMathews Forests and Waters 87\nlandowners for watershed protection services (Mun\u02dcoz Pin\u02dca et\nal. 2008).\nTranslation, Mistranslation, and the Building\nof Alternative Alliances\nSergio and the environmental NGOs that sought to help pre-\nvent logging in Yavesia were trying to build new political\nalliances between local forests and global climate. In doing\nso, they translated and mistranslated local concerns over the\nimpact of logging on springs and streams into concerns over\nglobal climate change and the impact of deforestation on\nrainfall. As we saw in the epigraphs to this article, this link\nbetween global environmental change, deforestation, and de-\nclining rainfall forms part of the powerful political rhetoric\nassembled by environmental activists such as Enrique Montiel\nand his allies. This is a framing of environmental degradation\nthat is sympathetic to urban Mexican audiences who are con-\ncerned about threats to their own water supplies and who\nhave a shared experience of urban environmental degradation.\nIn moving from local community concerns over environ-\nmental degradation caused by logging and the concrete con-\ncern to protect streams and springs (veneros, manantiales),\nthe environmental NGOs made a translation from locally spe-\ncific and territorialized concerns to a much stronger link be-\ntween deforestation, declining rainfall, and declining water\nsupplies for urban residents. This reframing of local interests\nsought to produce a new set of discursive and institutional\nrelationships that connected a heterogeneous array of actors\nand scales, from logging practices in the forests, state-level\npolitical discourse about urban water supplies and state bio-\ndiversity protection institutions, and fears of global climate\nchange, drought, and floods. This reframing appealed to the\ncharisma of the global (globally threatened biodiversity and\nclimate) and pointed to the threatened water supplies of the\nstate capital, Oaxaca. These new scales challenged the terri-\ntorialization of the community logging business that was sup-\nposed to be administered by foresters allied with the state\nnatural resources agency, SEMARNAP. Although they could\nnot compete with the economic weight of the logging busi-\nness, environmental NGOs supported an alternative set of\nnature and scale-making projects, conservation areas, eco-\nnomic alternatives, and institutional connections. For ex-\nample, Sierra Norte A.C. was involved in supporting a com-\nmunity water bottling business and an ecotourism project in\nYavesia and tried to act as an interlocutor with such outside\ninstitutions as the National Institute of Ecology.\nIn addition to deploying desiccation theory and biodiver-\nsity, Sergio often used the language of indigenous ecological\nwisdom and spirituality in his efforts to build alliances with\noutside institutions. As we have seen, no one in Ixtla\u00b4n claimed\nto protect forests in the name of nature spirits: in fact, it was\nonly intermediaries such as Sergio, or even outright outsiders,\nwho made this claim. Sergio was keen to argue that Ixtla\u00b4n\u2019s\ndesire to protect nature arose from the indigenous ecological\nknowledge and spiritual beliefs of elders. He told me on my\nfirst visit in 1998 that the Zapotec are also known as the\n\u201cCloud People\u201d and that the community elders protected \u201cthe\nplace where the water is born\u201d because of their spiritual beliefs\nand concern to protect nature. This was probably a recycling\nof the international discourse of indigenous ecological wis-\ndom24 described by Peter Brosius (1997) in Malaysia or by\nTania Li (2000) in Indonesia. An intermediary such as Sergio\nhad to be alert to urban and international environmental\ndiscourses if he was successfully to engage the interest of\noutsider institutions and traveling researchers such as myself.\nOther outsiders who attributed indigenous people\u2019s desire to\nprotect forests to religious beliefs included forestry officials\nin Oaxaca: one of them complained to me in exasperation\nthat it was indigenous beliefs in \u201cwater snakes\u201d found on\nsacred mountains that caused people to block logging in the\nname of their \u201cfamous springs.\u201d\nSergio\u2019s interest in articulating a discourse of indigenous\necological knowledge marked his own positioning with respect\nto an international and national discourse about indigenous\npeople as part of the politics of making sense of and claiming\ncontrol of forests. It is striking, therefore, that people in Ixtla\u00b4n\nspoke of the technical reasons for protecting forests and that\nit was outsiders or intermediaries such as Sergio who spoke\nof spiritual associations of indigenous beliefs about forests\nand waters. For the present, it seems that most people in\nIxtla\u00b4n prefer to claim practical knowledge and science, rather\nthan spirituality or indigeneity, as the basis for their knowl-\nedge of nature. They have succeeded in domesticating the\nscience of forestry within relatively stable community insti-\ntutions, and they have been able to build solid relationships\nwith outside institutions such as SEMARNAT. For now at\nleast, in Ixtla\u00b4n, popular science trumps spirituality and in-\ndigenous ecological wisdom. However, this is the product of\na specific articulation between local practices of nature making\nthrough logging and marking stand boundaries, community\nforestry institutions, their identities as forest managers, trav-\neling scientific theories, and outside institutions. It is perfectly\nconceivable that broader discursive and institutional shifts\nwould bring to the fore specifically indigenous knowledge\nwithin Ixtla\u00b4n.\nConclusions: Popular Desiccation\nTheory and State Science\nIn this article I have drawn on the classic ethnography of\nJulio de la Fuente to argue that in the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez of Oaxaca,\nthe encounter between state and indigenous environmental\ntheories during the 1930s produced a dramatic transformation\nin popular understandings of the relationship between forests,\n24. The international discourse about indigenous ecological wisdom\nis strikingly vague and tends to spiritualize indigenous ecological knowl-\nedge: it is therefore quite different from actual indigenous ecological\nknowledge (see in particular Brosius 1997).\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n88 Current Anthropology Volume 50, Number 1, February 2009\nsprings, and nature spirits. The currently popular belief that\ndeforestation causes declining streamflow and rainfall com-\nbines former state environmental theories with preexisting\nindigenous theories about the relationship between moun-\ntains, forests, nature spirits, and waters. Although nature spir-\nits are no longer much discussed in Ixtla\u00b4n, ritual practices of\nrainmaking on mountaintops and in caves appear to be wide-\nspread in other parts of Oaxaca and possibly in other parts\nof Mexico. It seems likely that the former association of spirits\nof water and rain with forested watersheds made desiccation\ntheory attractive to Zapotec people and explains why these\ntheories were so rapidly accepted in the 1920s and 1930s. For\na long period between around 1940 to 1990, desiccation the-\nory made little appearance in environmental politics, as the\nscale-making projects of industrial forestry made deforesta-\ntion and labor conditions of more importance to serranos.\nIncreasingly, since the early 1990s, desiccation theory has pro-\nvided a means of critiquing state forestry and building alli-\nances with other places, people, and scales. Serranos have\ncombined the formerly state-sponsored scientific theory of\ndesiccation with preexisting indigenous beliefs about the re-\nlationship between forests and waters; these theories inform\npresent-day practices of forest management and streamside\nprotection during logging.\nA key reason for the stability of popular desiccation theory\nat present lies in its ability to build connections and to reach\nfaraway places and audiences. Just as desiccation theory fa-\ncilitated former state efforts to control remote forests, it now\nhelps rural people resist the state and find urban allies. The\npublic performance of desiccation theory performs a network\nthat asserts global significance and can reach urban audiences.\nFrom its earliest days, desiccation theory has been vague as\nto exactly which scales of deforestation would have negative\neffects; the precise scale is specified in the routine practices\nof daily work in the forests (protecting streams, areas of forest)\nand in incipient institution building through the construction\nof political alliances. Activists and rural people can form net-\nworks of alliances between local natures and new environ-\nmental and development institutions, in order to destabilize\ndominant scales and forms of nature (such as forests to be\nmanaged for timber). It is precisely the vagueness of desic-\ncation theory that allows it to appeal in different ways to rural\npeople (who worry more about streams), environmentalists\nsuch as Sergio (who worry about biodiversity and climate\nchange), environmental activists such as the Montiel brothers,\nand urban audiences who worry more about water supply\nand climate change. There are numerous translations and\nmistranslations across the networks that support represen-\ntations of nature. In this sense, it is vagueness and mistran-\nslation that make alliance building possible (Van der Sluijs,\nShackley, and Wynne 1998) and that have come to cement\npopular beliefs into a relatively stable construct that is quite\nimpervious to state critique.\nPopular beliefs in climate\/forest connections in Mexico are\nof more than local significance; they structure the texture of\nencounters between state and civil society, they affect the ways\nthat scientific knowledge and expertise are asserted, contested,\nor denied, and they alter understandings of the very nature\nof state power. Existing studies of popular beliefs about cli-\nmate tend to concern themselves with local weather prediction\ntechniques or local climate knowledge (Goloubinoff, Katz,\nand Lammel 1997; Orlove, Chiang, and Cane 2002) or with\nthe likely impacts of climate change on \u201clocal societies.\u201d How-\never, beliefs about climate and local environments have dis-\ntinctly extra-local political effects. As numerous scholars have\npointed out, local places and scales are produced in relation\nto other places and scales (Jasanoff 2004a, 58; Tsing 2000);\nthese affect the forms of political engagement in which people\nwill engage. Stands of timber in Ixtla\u00b4n are linked to the forest\nservice in Oaxaca and then to the national level; it is the\nexistence of these multiple scales that allows for political al-\nliances between urban audiences, environmentalists, and rural\ninstitutions. Further, local beliefs about climate are critically\nimportant because they encode powerful framings of exper-\ntise, science, and state, enabling \u201clocal\u201d people to form extra-\nlocal alliances that destabilize the credibility and authority of\nstate forms of knowledge and power.\nThe discourse of desiccation has traveled far in time and\nspace\u2014from Doctor Azov in Chekhov\u2019s Uncle Vanya, to en-\nvironmental activists such as Montiel, to the mayor of Ixtla\u00b4n.\nAre we to see this as the imposition of a state environmental\ndiscourse on the subjects of rule? Foucauldian understandings\nof power would perhaps emphasize that although there is\ncontestation, the deep structure of epistemes nevertheless\ntends to strengthen states and bureaucrats over indigenous\npeople and peasants. Similarly, discourses of indigeneity rep-\nresent Western imaginings of the \u201cother\u201d\u2014and various au-\nthors have worried that indigenous peoples\u2019 appropriations\nof indigeneity may give too much power to extra-local actors,\nwho retain control of conceptions of modernity (Brosius\n1997; Conklin and Graham 1995). Like discourses of indi-\ngeneity or modernity, discourses of desiccation have an an-\ncient pedigree; desiccation discourse has remained remarkably\nunchanged over the past 2,000 years, and it too has often\nbeen deployed by states against their subjects. However, an\noverly discourse-centered approach may pay too little atten-\ntion to local constellations of institutions, discourses, iden-\ntities, and practices of producing nature, of building new\nalliances and forms of knowledge. Peoples\u2019 adoption of des-\niccation discourse in the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez and in other parts of\nMexico does not necessarily indicate state domination, nor\ndoes it necessarily make people in the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez vulnerable\nto outsiders\u2019 development projects. On the contrary, in this\ncase it marks a claim for popular scientific knowledge that\nundermines state knowledge and expert authority.\nState or international climate change science and policy\nwill not encounter passive local subjects: on the contrary, they\nare but the latest entanglement between traveling theories,\nfractured states, and continually shifting alliances of humans\nand nonhumans. As Sheila Jasanoff (2005) points out, socially\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMathews Forests and Waters 89\naccepted knowledge is the product of practices of participa-\ntion, deliberation, and representation. The texture of state-\nsociety relations profoundly affects the status of knowledge,\nthe legitimacy of the state, and the credibility of official knowl-\nedge claims. In Mexico, existing framings of the state as cor-\nrupt, of water supplies and forests as threatened, and of official\nknowledge as untrustworthy will be brought to bear on future\npolicies. It would be easy to think that climate change is a\nglobal science, a discourse that will remain in the hands of\ndistant officials who will seek to impose it on more or less\npassive local actors, who at best will receive or reject state\nscience. I suggest, on the contrary, that the travels of desic-\ncation theory into the environmental politics of waters and\nforests in Mexico show how people who produce new local\nnatures are also engaged in producing new forms of state\npower and in building alliances with distant outsiders. If forest\nprotection policies inspired by fears of climate change are to\nbe relatively stable and legitimate, they will have to confront\npopular understandings of states and of forests, of institutions,\nand of streams and waters.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was funded by the National Science Foundation\nProgram in Science and Technology Studies and by Fulbright-\nGarcia Robles and Switzer Fellowships and was made possible\nby the assistance of SEMARNAP, INIFAP, and the authorities\nand comuneros of Ixtla\u00b4n de Jua\u00b4rez in Oaxaca.

(tkchoy@ucdavis.edu). 27 X 08\nAndrew Mathews\u2019s paper offers an extremely insightful ex-\nposition of how a global alliance comes together through\u2014\nnot despite\u2014cultural, epistemological, and geographic dif-\nference. Catalyzing this coalition is an object (Mexico\u2019s forest\nand trees) and a loose concept (linking the cutting of trees\nwith negative impacts on water, the drying of streams, and\nthe cessation of rainfall) through which that object comes to\nstraddle the social worlds of forest dwellers, urban environ-\nmentalists, global environmental activists, and more. Through\nthis wide-ranging analysis of cultural encounter, historical\nchange, translocal alliance, and the scaling of political claim\nand community, Mathews pushes us to think about science\nand government together, attending to the ways forest man-\nagement became a mode of state making and rural subject\ndefinition while at the same time being careful to show us\nhow those who are ostensibly made subjects of the state and\nits sciences of government in fact recast its idioms in gen-\nerative ways. The paper is backed by rich evidence, including\nMathews\u2019s detailed account of the rise and fall of Quevedo\nand his dessication theories; moments from the archive show-\ning how, after encountering Quevedo\u2019s forestry officials, forest\ncommunities came to adopt their dessication discourse to\ninvolve the state in land disputes accusing their rivals of en-\ndangering local water supplies by cutting trees; and ethno-\ngraphic accounts wherein Mathews realizes to what extent\ncommunity foresters in Ixtla\u00b4n regard the forest as crucial to\nthe protection of water.\nMathews self-consciously presents his analysis through an\nencounter narrative: a precontact image of Zapotec beliefs\nabout nature spirits gleaned from a classic ethnography, an-\nother precontact image of Quevedo\u2019s beliefs and policies, the\nresulting cultural change among Zapotec people, and the un-\nexpected afterlife of such change in which the very cultural\nforms of state science imparted to Zapotec people a half-\ncentury ago become tools in current struggles against state\nauthority. In fact, the analysis works through several encoun-\nters. There is the midcentury encounter, where Quevedo\u2019s\nforest scientists meet forest communities. There is the en-\ncounter in 2001 between Mathews and a state biologist on\nthe one hand and community members in Ixtla\u00b4n de Jua\u00b4rez\non the other, in which community members easily differ with\ntheir visitors\u2019 efforts to convince them that cutting down trees\nwill not threaten their water supplies, prompting Mathews to\nmuse, \u201cWhy did locals so tenaciously and politely defend\nenvironmental theories that were contrary to the accepted\nscientific point of view? And how did they feel authorized to\ncontest the authority of science?\u201d And, finally, there is the\nencounter between forest communities and environmentalists\nfrom urban Mexico, in which they find common ground in\nthe equation between forest protection and the protection of\nweather\/climate but where the urban environmentalists mis-\ntakenly attribute forest communities\u2019 care for the forest to a\nconcern for nature spirits when in fact they typically cite\ntechnical explanations.\nThe theme of encounters, and the power-laden contexts\nthey reflect and generate, is crucial for any analysis of the\neffects of state science, not to mention studies of global en-\nvironmental activism.

But might the\nscholarship in science and technology studies cited by Ma-\nthews suggest that the very spaces of scientific consensus are\nthemselves constituted through mistranslations and loosely\ncompatible projects? I pose the question sympathetically\u2014I\nshare these challenges in writing about the politics of knowl-\nedge in environmental arenas. How might we write a bottom-\nup history of alliances such as this, an account of the things\ndifferent people know and say about trees, rain, air, and cli-\nmate and the ways these generate new modes of alliance and\nscale, as well as knowledges other than scientific consensus,\nwithout a connotation of lay mistake?\nMichael R.

(michael.dove@yale.edu). 5 XI 08\nWhen I first carried out fieldwork in the interior Kalimantan,\nIndonesia, in the 1970s, I was told a story of a cockfight (a\ntraditional method of dispute settlement) that had been\nfought between tribal elders and the first generation of gov-\nernment-schooled boys, to settle a debate over where rain\ncame from: the former said that it came from the sky, while\nthe latter, based on the theory of the hydrologic cycle that\nthey had acquired in school, insisted that it came from the\nearth (the latter lost the cockfight!). Mathews\u2019s wonderful\narticle deals with a similar confrontation between modern\nand premodern theories of weather and climate, at the same\ntime that it challenges our understanding of these theories.\nStudies such as this by anthropologists are sorely needed to-\nday, given the enormous and ever-increasing attention both\nwithin the academic world and in the public at large to the\nissue of global climate change. To date, most observers of the\nfield agree that scholarship on global climate change has been\nmarked by the relative dearth of contributions by social sci-\nentists, including anthropologists. Mathews\u2019s article is an ex-\ncellent example of how anthropology can contribute and can\ndo so by playing to, but also challenging and transcending,\nits traditional strengths.\nMathews begins with an ethnoclimatological analysis of\nindigenous, non-Western views of deforestation, groundwater,\nand climate in Oaxaca, but then he goes on to reveal a more\ncomplicated picture. Whereas the indigenous Zapotec of the\nSierra Jua\u00b4rez formerly had rainmaking beliefs and rituals, to-\nday they have a theory of \u201cdesiccation,\u201d which links defor-\nestation to the drying up of surface waters and the diminution\nof rainfall and is invoked by them to argue against logging.\nThe original source of this theory was the Mexican state itself,\nwhich had promulgated it early in the twentieth century only\nto move away from it by midcentury just as the folk theory\nof desiccation began to take hold. Today the most ardent\nproponents of indigenous \u201cspiritual ecology\u201d are metropolitan\nelites who are retrieving and reviving these beliefs in their\nefforts to combat logging. Over time, therefore, there has been\na partial exchange of positions between local and extra-local\nactors.\nMathews analyzes how climate theories change through\ntime, how they circulate across the landscape, and how they\narticulate (or not) with the belief systems of potential recip-\nients. Scientific desiccation theory was adopted by both native\nand urban audiences at the same time that it was falling out\nof favor with its original forestry\/science proponents, and\nindigenous beliefs were adopted by the environmentalist\/\nNGO audience at the same time that they were disappearing\nin native communities. The study of these shifts is a new type\nof historical project for anthropology, a history not just of\nthe environment but of environmental beliefs and theories.\nIt is made possible by Mathews\u2019s robust combination of field-\nwork, archival research, and engagement with both policy and\nactivist communities.\nThe specter of global climate change is already being de-\nployed by the Zapotec communities in their efforts to limit\nlogging. This is the coming face of the lived, local-level reality\nof climate change: namely, its discursive incorporation into\nongoing contests and collaborations between communities,\nforestry departments, interested urban publics, and environ-\nmental and community advocates. This ideological dimension\nof climate change has received some attention at the global\nlevel (e.g., Adger et al. 2001), less at the national level (e.g.,\nLahsen, forthcoming), and none at all at the local level, as\nhere. Local-level studies of the implications of climate change\nhave focused on its impacts on agriculture, health, and natural\nhazards (e.g., Eakin 2006) but not on political discourses of\nclimate, changes, causes, and culpability. Understanding this\nlatter set of impacts will be key to designing successful in-\nterventions in local systems of adaptation to climate change.\nOne challenge in designing such interventions is how to\ndeal with nonorthodox theories of climate change, such as\nthe folk Zapotec theory of desiccation. General consensus\nregarding the seriousness of the threat facing humanity, some\nsort of \u201cethnographic refusal\u201d (Ortner 1995), seems to govern\ntreatment of dissent in international academic discussions of\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMathews Forests and Waters 91\nclimate change (cf. Latour 2004b). But it is less clear what\nshould be done at the local level. Mathews shows how the\nZapotec put to constructive use the now-discredited theory\nof desiccation. In this way, among others, Mathews helps to\nexpand the horizons of what research lies ahead for us in\nstudying the looming question of the twenty-first century:\nhow will climate change, how will our understandings of cli-\nmate change, and how will these two sets of variables interact?\nTim Forsyth\nDevelopment Studies Institute, London School of\nEconomics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London\nWC2A 2AE, United Kingdom (t.j.forsyth@lse.ac.uk). 22 X\n08\nThe beauty of Andrew Mathews\u2019s ethnographically rich ex-\namination of science and politics in Oaxaca, Mexico, is that\nit provides a much-needed demonstration of how scientific\n\u201cfacts\u201d are not universal truths somehow separated from so-\nciety but instead are shaped and upheld by social solidarities\nwho use scientific discourses to enhance other political con-\ntests. Mathews\u2019s distinctive contribution to this debate is to\nprovide a valuable case study where an \u201cepistemic alliance\u201d\nhas emerged between unlikely actors to uphold desiccation\ntheory and to demonstrate\u2014in complex ways\u2014how these\nactors have transformed simplistic statements about forests\nand rainfall into \u201cconvenient truths.\u201d\nI would still like to question Mathews on two points. First,\nthe paper tends to portray desiccation theory as a fixed item\nthat different actors use for political purposes. (For example,\nthe state used it for rationalizing local behavior some decades\nago; local people now use it to gain legitimacy and support\nfrom the state.) I propose that this is not always so. The\n\u201ctheory,\u201d or its proposed factual accounts of nature, reflects\nthe alliances that uphold it and consequently transforms ac-\ncording to local contexts. In Oaxaca, Mathews tells us that\ntoday\u2019s context is largely a moral concern about logging from\npeople negatively affected by it. According to research in other\ncontexts, these concerns might be, say, reforestation or re-\nsettlement, and accordingly, the \u201ctheory\u201d is not necessarily\nthe same in each location because different concerns or con-\nstellations of actors influence which \u201cfacts\u201d are used to serve\npolitics. As with so-called Himalayan environmental degra-\ndation theory (another scientific discourse critically examined\nby anthropologists), the word \u201ctheory\u201d invokes an image of\nuniversality, yet the crucial lesson is that such things are not\nuniversal.\nThis observation is important because it influences how\nstate\u2013society relations occur or how science evolves as politics.\nShould we see state\u2013society engagement in terms of different\nactors (or nodes of power) looking for tools (in this case\ndesiccation theory) to strengthen their battles with each other?\nOr is power best understood in more prevalent and shifting\nterms\u2014in the manner of Foucault\u2014where actors themselves\nare shaped by the discourses and tools they adopt? In the case\nof Oaxaca, community leaders invoke desiccation discourses\nto seek alliances with the state and to empower themselves\nagainst logging. Yet choosing this discourse also forecloses\nother activities (including forms of agriculture or forest clear-\nance) for local people, even though these activities might not\nbe as environmentally damaging as the discourse implies. Em-\npowering a dominant scientific discourse such as desiccation\ntheory might therefore risk adopting one set of benefits at\nthe same time as some restrictions.\nThe second point follows from this discussion. What is the\nbest way to rethink science\u2013society relations? Mathews uses\nthe words \u201ctranslations and mistranslations\u201d to refer to how\n\u201cpopular science\u201d might be similar to or different from ac-\ncepted explanations from hydrological science. I suggest that\nthis frame overlooks the shifting way that knowledge is made\nauthoritative. It also implies, optimistically, that political de-\nbates one day might converge on the accepted authority of\nhydrologists as the best available indication of how forests\nand climate are really linked.\nAgain, I suggest that the power of the scientific discourse\nis stronger than Mathews proposes and that the work of hy-\ndrologists\u2014excellent within their own contexts\u2014can still be\nlinked to social solidarities. More work needs to be done on\nhow and why different truth claims about hydrological ex-\nplanation emerge as politically authoritative rather than just\non how different actors use these discourses. For example,\nMathews writes that \u201cgovernmentalizing discourses require\nconcrete institutions . . . discourse alone is insufficient to\ninculcate state ideologies.\u201d Yet, to my mind, when actors pre-\nsent desiccation theory as a universal truth (even though it\nshifts between contexts), this effectively makes it a \u201cconcrete\u201d\ninstitution. Consequently, I suggest that there is still a need\nto understand scientific discourse as a mobile source of po-\nlitical authority and as a disciplining force in its own right.\nThe wider point of my comment is that scientific statements\n(whether from formal science or within popular narratives)\nare more powerful and more contingent on political action\nthan commonly thought. Dissecting these truth claims, to\ndemonstrate the contingency of values, political agency, and\nscience, offers the opportunity to address social inequalities\narising from unexamined discourse and the chance to un-\nderstand environmental change better. Mathews\u2019s paper dem-\nonstrates various reasons why discourses are upheld in ways\nthat do not make them transparent. This is an important\nlesson. More effective environmental policy, arguably, might\nneed to consider why\u2014and on whose authority and values\u2014\nscientific statements might be considered true. Such a process\nmight not only challenge popular discourses such as desic-\ncation theory but also allow hydrologists to learn.\nIn my view, Mathews\u2019s paper is a useful contribution to\nunderstanding the dynamics of how biophysical explanations\nof environmental change are reified and amplified through\npolitical conflicts. Power is both located in and expressed by\nscientific discourse. Mathews\u2019s combination of local ethnog-\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n92 Current Anthropology Volume 50, Number 1, February 2009\nraphy and concepts from science and technology studies is\nboth useful and timely.\nDavid Kaimowitz\nFord Foundation, Mexico and Central America Office,\nEmilio Castelar 131, Colonia Polanco, 11560 Mexico D.F.,\nMexico (d.kaimowitz@fordfound.org). 31 X 08\nThe central tenets of Andrew Mathews\u2019s paper, which say that\ndifferent social actors adopt scientific narratives to meet their\nown needs and that local actors do not simply incorporate\nstate-sponsored or global discourses but rather shape them\nto suit their purposes, are undoubtedly true. Nor can there\nbe much doubt that discourses about the complex links be-\ntween vegetation and water present an excellent example of\nthis.\nJust about everything Mathews says in this paper has some\ntruth to it. Nonetheless, in various instances he takes his\nargument too far to make his point. Specifically, he overstates\nthe extent to which current conventional scientific wisdom\nhas discarded desiccation theory. It is probably more accurate\nto say that the current consensus is that the impact of veg-\netation on rainfall, dry season streamflow, and flooding is\nlikely to be very location and scale dependent. Consequently,\nthere are probably many contexts in which deforestation or\nlogging has little or no impact on rainfall, dry season stream-\nflow, or flooding or in which it actually increases the first two\nof these. On the other hand, there are probably other situa-\ntions where the opposite holds. Mathews may underestimate\nthe extent to which these latter situations provide empirical\nevidence that reinforces the existing belief systems. Even\nthough deforestation and logging probably have little or no\nimpact on large-scale floods that cause massive damage to\nlarge areas, they probably can, in fact, significantly contribute\nto small-scale flooding. Similarly, growing evidence suggests\nthat relatively small-scale changes in land use influence pre-\ncipitation patterns more than previously believed. Mathews\nsays that whether desiccation theory is false is not really central\nto his argument, but that is not entirely true.\nSimilarly, the paper fails to consider the possibility that one\nmajor reason that people have come to believe desiccation\ntheory is that, in many regions, declines in forest cover and\nquality have occurred contemporaneously to declines in the\nstreamflow and the availability of water. In many, if not most,\nof those cases, it is likely that other factors explain the de-\nclining supply of water\u2014such as greater competition for water\nby various types of upstream users. This provides potential\nalternative explanations for communities\u2019 thinking beyond\nthose offered by Mathews.\nMathews also overstates his argument that government of-\nficials and the forestry science establishment in Mexico have\nabandoned desiccation theory. Many Mexican government\nofficials, professional foresters, and academics continue to\nactively believe and promote this theory in their public state-\nments, and that no doubt also helps reenforce local com-\nmunities\u2019 beliefs in those theories. Less than five years ago,\nthe Mexican government adapted a program to pay com-\nmunities to conserve forests so that they would continue to\nprovide hydrological services such as the ones Mathews says\ndo not exist\u2014so these ideas are by no means dead within the\nMexican government. (However, it should also be acknowl-\nedged that there are groups within the Mexican government\nthat do not believe desiccation theory but nonetheless con-\ntinue to espouse it or keep quiet because they feel it is po-\nlitically expedient to do so.)\nThe two examples Mathews discusses of Yavesia and Ixtla\u00b4n\ndemonstrate the complexity of these processes. In Yavesia it\nis relatively evident that adopting desiccation theory has\nhelped local groups who oppose logging, who do not want\nthe larger territorial authority of which they are part to dom-\ninate them, and whose positions help them to obtain prestige\nand material benefits, to justify their positions and find urban\nand international allies. On the other hand, in Ixtla\u00b4n desic-\ncation theory actually makes life more complicated for a com-\nmunity whose livelihoods depend largely on logging and wood\nprocessing, yet, nonetheless, they have not abandoned it, de-\nspite the fact that they sometimes lose income as a result. So\nit is clearly more complex than simply being a matter that\nthe communities adopt these views to meet their immediate\ninterests.\nMathews\u2019s paper addresses important issues, makes rele-\nvant arguments, and provides useful data. I just would not\ntake it too far.\nChristian A. Kull\nSchool of Geography and Environmental Science, Monash\nUniversity, Building 11, Melbourne, Victoria 3800, Australia\n(christian.kull@arts.monash.edu.au). 24 X 08\nPolitical ecologists, among others, have made it their business\nto demonstrate how governments have a tendency to use\noutdated, debatable, or mistaken scientific theories to justify\ninterventions in environmental management, generally to the\ndetriment of the resource access rights and livelihoods of rural\nfarmers or herders (Fairhead and Leach 1996; Laris 2004;\nForsyth and Walker 2008; Kull 2004). While attentive to peas-\nant resistance, few political ecologists aside from Andrew Ma-\nthews have investigated the ways in which rural communities\nmay make use of such scientific theories themselves, partic-\nularly ones that scientists deem no longer valid.\nThe theory the rural Mexican community Mathews studies\nhas latched on to, desiccation theory, is popular in many\nplaces around the world (both in the public and in govern-\nments) and is very relevant to policy, given global and regional\nconcerns over water supply. For instance, desiccation theory\nlies behind ideas of \u201cdesertification\u201d in the Sahelian zone of\nWest Africa, helping to inspire interventions such as fire bans\nand green belts (Laris and Wardell 2006). It is called on, in\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMathews Forests and Waters 93\none way or another, to justify forest conservation or tree\nplanting, usually by the state, with attendant controls on local\naccess. That a rural community is using it to its own advantage\ndemonstrates the way in which a decade or two of \u201ccom-\nmunity-based natural resource management\u201d has, in some\nplaces, turned the tables.\nOne of the few countries where desiccation theory is pop-\nularly held to be false (in accordance with most hydrological\nstudies) is South Africa. Here, vast stands of eucalypts, pines,\nand wattles are accused of reducing streamflows by almost\n7% (Le Maitre et al. 2002). Arguably, a key reason that sci-\nentists were able to turn the public against desiccation theory\nwas the presence of another ascendant narrative, that of \u201cin-\nvasive alien\u201d species. Almost all forestry species in South Af-\nrica are introduced; several are declared invasives, and they\nhave demonstrable impacts on fire regimes and on the bio-\ndiversity of the grassland and fynbos communities they re-\nplace. This case shows that popular narratives about the place\nof trees in landscapes is shaped not just by hydrological the-\nories but also by ecological concerns that in many cases bleed\ninto social sentiments about plants belonging (or not) in par-\nticular places or, for that matter, in particular national iden-\ntities (Head and Muir 2004; Kull and Rangan 2008).\nThe way in which Mathews brings scale into this analysis\nis intriguing. He demonstrates that desiccation theory works\nbecause it allows for the building of links between actors\noperating at different levels of governmental or environmental\nscales (i.e., between villagers concerned with their forests, city\ndwellers concerned with their water supplies, politicians con-\ncerned with their national environments, or environmentalists\nconcerned with the global environment). He points out how\ndesiccation discourse aids villagers in taking the thunder away\nfrom powerful forestry interests located at a particular level\nof institutional and environmental scale. Yet he also asserts\nthat different actors, such as Sergio and the environmental\nNGOs, used desiccation discourse to reframe local interests\ntogether with urban and global ones to make \u201cnew scales.\u201d I\nam unconvinced by this language, as well as that of \u201cscale-\nmaking projects.\u201d Humans do create scales through their in-\nstitutions and observational methods (such as municipalities-\ndistricts-provinces, communities-ecosystems-biomes, or\npixels and quadrats). Yet the moments Mathews alludes to\nseem to me not to be scale-making projects but instead pro-\njects to translate between extant levels of scale or projects that\nhighlight particular levels of scale by attaching values to them\nor making them particularly powerful. Industrial forestry or\nNGO campaigns, in this case, have not made new scales;\ninstead, they place value on certain processes and certain\ncategories that already sit at particular levels of scale.\nDiscourses such as desiccation theory can be seen as ve-\nhicles that allow us to translate between the ontological scales\nat which social and natural processes occur and the episte-\nmological scales that humans create to order, control, and\nanalyze these processes. They are ways in which people seek\nto make sense of the world and to communicate sensibilities\nover changes to social and ecological landscapes. By invoking\nnormative judgments, they also politicize such changes (Ran-\ngan and Kull 2008). Mathews has shown how the desiccation\ndiscourse is mobilized to assert control over forests and how\nit flexibly allows villagers to seek allies with other actors work-\ning at different political and environmental levels of scale.\nWhat remains to be seen is whether and how villagers, their\nNGO allies, and the discourse itself can adapt in any way to\nthe competing idea of \u201ctrees as water suckers,\u201d which has\nbecome prominent in South Africa. On the basis of that com-\nparison, one might expect a turn toward the ascendant dis-\ncourse of nativism\u2014as in protecting native biodiversity\u2014as\nthe next way in which communities defend their forests. Can\nthe nature spirits, the duen\u02dcos del cerro, be mobilized to support\nthis discourse, as for desiccation theory?\nAndrew Walker\nResource Management in Asia-Pacific Program, Research\nSchool of Pacific and Asian Studies, Coombs Building,\nAustralian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital\nTerritory 0200, Australia (andrew.walker@anu.edu.au). 19 X\n08\nAndrew Mathews\u2019s is an engaging and historically rich ac-\ncount of the role of desiccation theory in local and national\ndebates about forest management in Mexico. Mathews shows\nus that indigenous activists in Mexico have been able to use\ndesiccation theory to form discursive and practical alliances\nwith conservationists, NGOs, and urban residents in various\ncampaigns against industrial logging. The idea that cutting\ndown forests reduces rainfall and streamflow has been around\nin Mexico, and elsewhere, for a very long time. What Mathews\ndemonstrates is that desiccation theory flows in and out of\nenvironmental debates according to specific intersections be-\ntween actors, institutions, and nature itself. He does this by\nproductively following links that take him, spatially and tem-\nporally, well away from his primary field site in the southern\nMexican town of Ixtla\u00b4n. It is a fascinating journey.\nMathews\u2019s examination of the historically uneven contri-\nbution of desiccation theory to the forest policies pursued by\nvarious Mexican governments is an important contribution,\nbut I have a more general reservation about his treatment of\nthe state. Like many of the writers he cites, Mathews is aiming\nfor a more fragmented and flexible approach to the state. He\naims to explore the locally specific mixes of discourse, co-\nercion, and performance that \u201cproduce new identities, polit-\nical practices, and forms of knowledge.\u201d This makes a lot of\nsense. However, to my reading, Mathews persists with a binary\nmodel that pits states against subjects. Of course, he goes to\ngreat lengths to show that the forest dwellers of southern\nMexico are far from passive subjects. Popular desiccation the-\nory itself emerged as an amalgam of state policy, science, and\nlocal ideas about nature spirits, mountains, and springs. This\nis a nuanced account of the unruly middle ground of state\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n94 Current Anthropology Volume 50, Number 1, February 2009\nformation. But too often the discussion slips into more sim-\nplistic statements, whereby local knowledge and practices \u201cun-\ndermine,\u201d \u201cbypass,\u201d \u201cpenetrate,\u201d \u201ccontest, subvert, or evade,\u201d\n\u201ccritique,\u201d \u201cdestabilize,\u201d and \u201cresist\u201d state power. I have no\ndoubt that some forest management disputes involve specific\nconfrontations between readily demarcated \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cstate\u201d\ninterests, but I would have liked to have gotten a stronger\nconceptual and ethnographic sense of the interpersonal do-\nmain in which officials, loggers, farmers, community leaders,\nand NGOs negotiate policies and play with different forms\nof environmental knowledge.\nThe \u201clocal\u201d and the \u201cpopular\u201d could also have been ad-\ndressed with more critical precision. At some points the paper\ngives the impression that popular desiccation theory is wide-\nspread in the places where Mathews worked. But I did not\nget a clear sense of just how widespread and locally influential\nit is. I had a lingering feeling throughout the paper that this\nwas a theory most actively (and selectively) promoted by \u201cin-\ndigenous community leaders\u201d and, in particular, their allies\nin urban-based NGOs. Whose knowledge is this? Mathews\ntakes up this issue by referring to \u201ctranslation and mistran-\nslation\u201d of local environmental concerns by NGO activists.\nThe \u201cmistranslation\u201d is most evident in NGO framing of\ndesiccation theory in terms of indigenous beliefs about nature\nspirits. Mathews tells us that such beliefs now have very little\nlocal currency. Nevertheless, he is sympathetic to the \u201cskillful\u201d\nNGO linking of local beliefs to international discourses about\n\u201cindigenous ecological wisdom,\u201d and he seems keen to con-\ntribute to the process by uncovering remnants of spirit belief\nand rainmaking ritual. He suggests that more specifically \u201cin-\ndigenous\u201d forms of local knowledge may emerge in the future.\nI would have appreciated a more critical engagement with\nthis sort of mistranslation, \u201creframing,\u201d and, perhaps, mis-\nrepresentation. Mathews clearly shows that there are active\nlocal disputes about the costs and benefits of logging, and\npresumably quite different forms of knowledge are deployed\nin these disputes. But his priority focus is on the desiccation\nalliance between \u201cindigenous leaders,\u201d NGOs, and urban res-\nidents on the basis that it enables \u201cforest communities\u201d to\npromote forms of knowledge that \u201cdestabilize dominant scales\nand forms of nature.\u201d But what are the local social and po-\nlitical impacts of these sorts of alliances? Logging, in its various\n\u201cindustrial\u201d and community-based forms, clearly has its local\nopponents, but what about its role in supporting local live-\nlihoods? Mathews indicates that the timber industry employs\na substantial percentage of the workforce of Ixtla\u00b4n. What do\nthese workers think about the promotion of desiccation the-\nory? Are they comfortable with the alliances between local\n\u201cleaders\u201d and NGOs? Who do the \u201cleaders\u201d lead? And, as\nMathews demonstrates, environmental arguments directed\nagainst industrial logging can also be readily deployed against\nfarmers, especially those who opt for the more commercial\nforms of agriculture that many conservation-oriented NGOs\nfind distasteful.\nMathews has done an excellent job of exploring desiccation\ntheory across various spatial and temporal scales. But the local\nscale and the micropolitics of environmental debate in divided\n\u201ccommunities\u201d could have received more critical attention.\nUnlikely alliances can also be high-risk ones.\nReply\nI thank the commentators for their generous and thoughtful\ncomments. I have learned a great deal from the variety of\nreadings that they have given my arguments and from the\nadditional directions that they suggest. My response is nec-\nessarily selective: in what follows I have linked themes that\nwere touched on by several readers, followed by my response\nto more specific points. I have grouped their remarks into\ndiscussion of (1) translation\/mistranslation, (2) the empirical\nvalidity of desiccation theory, (3) states and communities, and\n(4) the power of publics.\nTranslation\/Mistranslation. \u201cTranslation\u201d and \u201cmistransla-\ntion\u201d are dangerous and powerful words. As Choy insightfully\npoints out, their connotations of a binary between truth and\nfalsehood are at odds with my larger critical project. Similarly,\nForsyth worries that I see popular science as a \u201cmistransla-\ntion,\u201d implying an eventual possible clarification or unifica-\ntion when the authority of hydrologists is finally accepted.\nWalker too wants more detail on the translations\/mistransla-\ntions carried out by local NGOs and leaders, probing a little\nto see whether these might be opportunistic misrep-\nresentations.\nI should perhaps have avoided \u201cmistranslation\u201d entirely\nand accompanied the linguistic sense of \u201ctranslation\u201d with\nmetaphors such as \u201cweaving,\u201d \u201centangling,\u201d and \u201ctransform-\ning.\u201d I had thought of translation\/mistranslation not in terms\nof truth and falsehood but in terms of the frustrations and\npleasures of translating, the perennial sense that the transla-\ntion betrays our best efforts and intentions. My goal was to\nhighlight how environmentalists engaged in a productive\nweaving and braiding of epistemic alliances. When I say that\nNGO representatives \u201cskillfully\u201d translate and mistranslate,\nmy intention is to highlight the practical knowledge and po-\nlitical judgment they use, not to accuse them of intellectual\ndishonesty. We do not think it dishonest of scientists to weave\ntogether material and political alliances to support their facts,\nand I do not think environmentalists and community leaders\nare dishonest for doing so either.\nWithin science and technology studies, translation is used\nin both a linguistic and a spatial sense, where actors seek to\n\u201ccut\u201d the networks supporting competing forms of knowledge\nand to translate allies toward their own preferred interpre-\ntations (Callon 1986). Translation, then, is creative and always\nprovisional: \u201cTranslating interests means at once offering new\ninterpretations of these interests and channeling people in\ndifferent directions\u201d (Latour 1987, 118). This sense of trans-\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMathews Forests and Waters 95\nlation is not of a true\/false opposition, describing rather the\ncreative practice of making knowledge, persuading people,\nand finding material allies. Translating, blurring, and trans-\nforming meanings are activities carried out by environmental\nscientists (Van der Sluijs, Shackley, and Wynne 1998) and are\nnot the actions of politically motivated environmentalists or\nmisguided rural people. In these accounts, translations are\nincomplete; they are acts of knitting, weaving, and tying to-\ngether that are in a final sense provisional and open to chal-\nlenge or unweaving.\nOn the Empirical Validity of Desiccation Theory. A number\nof the commentators are concerned that I imply that the\nknowledge of environmental scientists is correct, while that\nof environmental activists and rural people is incorrect, and\nthat some future unification at the expense of rural people is\nto be hoped for. Forsyth and Choy were both, in different\nways, worried that my usage of the term \u201ctranslation\u201d implied\na lay mistake, that popular belief in desiccation is a \u201cmis-\ntranslation\u201d of state science. I want to link these concerns\nconstructively to Kaimowitz\u2019s concern that I do not consider\n\u201cthe possibility that one major reason that people have come\nto believe desiccation theory is that, in many regions, declines\nin forest cover and quality have occurred contemporaneously\nto declines in the streamflow and the availability of water.\u201d I\ndisagree with his immediate point, but I think that he has\nput his finger on the larger structural question of how we\nshould write and think about the natural sciences, a question\nthat is central to this essay and to environmental anthropology\nand anthropology of science and technology more generally.\nFirst on where we disagree: I do not think that it makes\nZapotec peoples\u2019 knowledge about forests and water scarcity\neither more or less empirically correct when I point out the\nlong historical and cultural history of desiccation theory and\nthe particular contingencies that brought it to the Sierra Jua\u00b4-\nrez. This is the difference between \u201cexplaining\u201d and \u201cexplain-\ning away\u201d: all people everywhere, including hydrologists, bu-\nreaucrats, and farmers, bring culture and history to the\nmaking of knowledge. By linking history and culture to local\npeoples\u2019 understanding of forests, I seek to add rather than\nto subtract, to explain how people believe in desiccation theory\nwithout explaining it away as a product of discourse, class,\ninstitutions, culture, or economic interests. Latour (2004b,\n246) suggests this approach when he remarks: \u201cThe critic is\nnot the one who debunks, but the one who assembles. The\ncritic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet\nof the na\u0131\u00a8ve believers, but the one who offers the participants\narenas in which to gather.\u201d If rural people note water scarcity\nand blame it on deforestation rather than on construction,\ndevelopment, and increased water abstraction, this does not\nundermine the validity of their experience and knowledge of\nwater scarcity.\nMy project in this essay was not to compare the \u201cgood\nknowledge\u201d of scientists with the \u201cbad knowledge\u201d of others\nbut to show how people with different kinds of knowledge\ngo about forming alliances. I am asking not \u201cIs this true or\nfalse knowledge?\u201d but \u201cWhat kind of knowledge is this, and\nhow was it produced?\u201d This directs analysis toward who holds\nknowledge and the kinds of practices, material relations, in-\nstitutions, alliances, and networks that hold their knowledge\ntogether and give it its particular heft and meaning. In this\nsense, I agree with Kaimowitz when he says that the empirical\nvalidity of desiccation theory does affect my argument. I\nshould have spelled out the material, cultural, and institu-\ntional location of current hydrological research more clearly,\nin order to avoid the appearance of comparing the solidity\nof scientists\u2019 knowledge with the illusion of rural beliefs in\ndesiccation. This is what Forsyth calls for when he says that\nwe need more work on \u201chow and why different truth claims\nabout hydrological explanation emerge as politically\nauthoritative.\u201d\nKull correctly situates my work in conversation with po-\nlitical ecologists and anthropologists who have described how\ngovernments use \u201coutdated, debatable, or mistaken scientific\ntheories\u201d in order to assert control and claim resources from\nrural people. Valuable and politically important as this body\nof work is, it can have a flavor of debunking official knowledge\nin favor of the critic\u2019s \u201cbetter knowledge,\u201d of comparing the\nbad ecological or hydrological knowledge of certain states or\ninstitutions with the critic\u2019s own rather better, more up-to-\ndate ecological knowledge. Often, such criticisms are \u201cun-\nmasking critiques\u201d that reveal that the apparently technical is\nreally a mask that reveals various forms of material and dis-\ncursive domination. Although I did want to introduce readers\nto hydrologists\u2019 rather surprising lack of agreement with des-\niccation theory, my larger project was not to engage in a\n\u201cdebunking\u201d of Mexican state science or popular belief. I am\nconcerned not with describing discursive domination but with\ntracing transformations in official and popular environmental\ntheories over the twentieth century. I have tried to move\nbeyond understandings of scientific knowledge as an author-\nitative discourse that is homogeneously shared by officials who\nseek to impose state power, focusing rather on the contingent\nand unexpected ways that scientific theories are mobilized\nand applied to new places and produce new kinds of knowl-\nedge and new forms of political alliance and opposition. Here,\nKull\u2019s comparative examples from Africa (a region about\nwhich I know little) are particularly helpful, emphasizing that\nknowledge of the relationship between forests and climate is\nstabilized not just by hydrology but also by its articulations\nwith ecological science, social sentiments about plants, and\neven national identities.\nKaimowitz is concerned that I overstate the extent to which\ncurrent scientific thinking has discarded desiccation theory,\npointing to recent studies that show that relatively small-scale\nchanges in land use influence precipitation patterns more than\npreviously believed. There is no last word on the relationship\nbetween deforestation, floods, and climate, and I defer to his\naccount of the latest research (see Bonell and Bruijnzeel 2004;\nKaimowitz 2004). However, I suggest that the fervor and de-\ntermination of scientists\u2019 continued search for a relationship\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n96 Current Anthropology Volume 50, Number 1, February 2009\nbetween forests, climate, and floods is partly a product of\ntheir cultural, political, and institutional locations. After more\nthan a century of research, the results are startlingly contra-\ndictory; hydrologists and other researchers might not have\ncontinued in the face of so much contrary evidence if their\nquestions were not guided partly by cultural commitments.\nThis does not in any way undermine the empirical validity\nof hydrological science. No one thinks that America\u2019s cultural\nlove affair with the motor car weakens the quality of amateur\ncar racers\u2019 mechanical knowledge; no more should we think\nit a scandal that cultural commitments to a relationship be-\ntween forests and climate affect hydrologists\u2019 research\ndecisions.\nKaimowitz and I agree that there is some disagreement\nabout desiccation theory within official and scientific circles\nin Mexico. He sees more scientific agreement with it; I see\nrather less. I agree with him that many (perhaps most) policy\nmakers in Mexico affirm some version of desiccation theory;\nI suggest that this is partly because they are attuned to the\nbeliefs of popular audiences, who emphatically do believe in\nsome form of desiccation theory. There is, in contrast, much\ndifference of opinion in scientific circles: it is not so much\nthat desiccation theory is entirely discarded as it is that some\nscientists hold very much qualified and transformed aspects\nof it and that they do so with considerable qualification and\nmuch debate. I should add, however, that foresters almost\nunanimously and rather strongly regard desiccation theory as\nfalse and are willing to openly state that rather than attracting\nwater, trees suck it out of the ground.\nIn this regard, it is helpful to compare the fervor, confi-\ndence, and unity of policy makers and scientists during 1930s\nwith the more nuanced position of policy statements in the\npresent. Although forests are firmly linked to water in national\npolicies such as the Cruzada Nacional por los Bosques y el\nAgua (Crusade for Forests and Water), to which I briefly\nreferred, the scientific explanations on the Cruzada Web pages\nemphasize that forests assist water infiltration into the water\ntable and that forest soils \u201cabsorbed four times as much rain\nas pastures, and eighteen times as much rain as bare soil\u201d\n(SEMARNAT 2006). The link between forests and rainfall that\nwas so clear in the 1930s is now much muted: in an illustration\non another page, the Cruzada claims that \u201cthe freshness of\nforested areas attracts rain and protects the soil\u201d (SEMARNAT\n2006). The composers of the Cruzada pages had to juggle\ntheir commitment to current scientific thinking, in which\nforests may protect water supplies through water infiltration\ninto soils, while simultaneously appealing to popular beliefs,\nwhich see forests as preservers of the climate through their\nability to attract rain. This tension between the present state\nof global environmental science, which is to say at least rather\nequivocal, contrasts with the political realities of a Mexican\npublic that is largely certain that forests attract rain and supply\nwater. Writers of public relations manifestos such as the Cru-\nzada are forced to skillfully elide this gap between state and\npopular environmental theories. It is interesting to compare\nthis rather nuanced linkage of forest and water with the un-\nambiguous rhetoric of popular environmental campaigns. In\na park in Mexico City in 2008, slogans tied to trees warned:\n\u201cUrgent warning from nature! [When] You Cut Trees, You\nSteal Water! Stop, or you will have Drought and Death!\u201d (See\nfig. 3.)\nAnother example of the way that popular beliefs affect of-\nficial policy declarations is the payment for hydrological ser-\nvices program that Kaimowitz mentions. According to one\nparticipant, the decision to pay for forests\u2019 hydrological ser-\nvices was taken in spite of scientific uncertainty and partly as\na result of the belief among policy makers, politicians, and\nthe public that forests produce water (Mun\u02dcoz Pin\u02dca et al. 2008).\nStates and Communities. Walker is concerned about the lack\nof detail I provide on politics within communities and on\ntheir relationship with the state. He points out that my usage\nof words such as \u201cundermine,\u201d \u201cbypass,\u201d and \u201csubvert\u201d may\nsuggest a simple demarcation of opposed state and local in-\nterests. I am sympathetic to this argument, and I agree that\nmuch writing on state-community relations takes for granted\nthese kinds of oppositions. Communities in Oaxaca are deeply\nimbricated with state power and often in alliance with state\ninstitutions, while individual community leaders may piece\ntogether careers that move back and forth between com-\nmunity and government service. I have addressed these par-\nticular points in other writings (Mathews 2003, 2008), but in\nthis essay I emphasized opposition, with its associated met-\naphors of contestation and subversion, because at present in\nMexico desiccation theory is so often used in moments of\nopposition to the state. People who wish to ally themselves\nwith the government are more apt to talk of scientific forestry\nor development. I agree with him also that communities are\nof course not unified, harmonious, or virtuous: they have\ninternal hierarchies and conflicts of their own, and one such\nconflict is that between pro- and antilogging factions.\nThe Power of Publics. Dove insightfully locates my essay in\nconversation with anthropological research on climate\nchange. He highlights the separation between a small but\ngrowing body of research on climate change policy makers,\nindustry leaders, scientists, journalists, and financial elites\n(Lahsen 2004, 2008) and a rather larger body of research that\nfocuses on local impacts, knowledge, and adaptation to cli-\nmate change (e.g., Crate 2008). Dove has long argued that\nwe need to carry out research that links and compares elite\nand popular beliefs (Dove 1983, 1986), while Lahsen (2007)\nhas written on the problematic links between international\nand local climate change science. In this essay I have proposed\ntwo ways that \u201clocal\u201d beliefs about climate can affect appar-\nently extra-local knowledge of scientists and policy makers:\nfirst, through the unwillingness of audiences to passively ac-\ncept official knowledge, and, second, through the ability of\n\u201clocals\u201d to forge extra-local political and epistemic alliances.\nThe arrow of influence is not one way: local beliefs affect\nnational policy audiences in Mexico.\nThe science and technology studies literature on copro-\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:08:08 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nMathews Forests and Waters 97\nduction (Jasanoff 2004a, 2004b), suggests that publics have a\npowerful role in the making of socially accepted knowledge,\nthat they are not passive subjects or audiences, and that public\nconceptions of knowledge and the state in turn affect the\nformation of environmental policy itself. Science and tech-\nnology studies scholars have long argued that knowledge and\npolitical order are always produced together (Latour 2004a;\nShapin and Schaffer 1985); Zapotec loggers who remake\nknowledge of climate and forests are also engaged in re-\nimagining the state, so that local knowledge has powerful\nextra-local effects. Epistemic alliances between rural people,\nurban publics, and well-meaning environmentalists do polit-\nical work and limit the formation of official environmental\npolicies. However, as Tsing (2005) warns us, collaborations\ncan be dangerous or immoral as well as productive and pos-\nitive; they are essentially ambiguous. The urban-rural alliances\nI describe are similarly ambiguous and possibly dangerous:\nthey may one day allow urban environmentalists to block\nlogging in forest communities in the Sierra Jua\u00b4rez. Like\nWalker, I am worried about the possible cost to community\nlivelihoods, and I find the pervasive antilogging politics of\nsome conservationists in Mexico deeply troubling. I agree with\nhim that \u201cunlikely alliances may also be high-risk ones.\u201d I\nwould add, however, that rural people are probably better off\nhaving two sets of possible alliances than one and that com-\nmunities that can play the forest service off against environ-\nmentalists may be in a better position than communities that\nhave no choice of allies.\nI have argued that alliances between rural audiences, en-\nvironmentalists, and urban publics are forms of scale jumping\nand of scale making. Kull suggests that there is more scale\njumping than scale making here. Scale jumping is certainly a\nlarge part of the story, as when environmental NGOs helped\nthe community of Yavesia appeal to audiences in the city of\nOaxaca in order to undermine the community logging busi-\nness. However, there is also new scale making going on. Wa-\ntershed protection forests and water bottling plants are linked\nto urban water buyers through markets, protection of en-\ndangered species is linked to ecotourism lodges and walking\ntrails, and none of these scales fits within the existing nested\nbureaucratic\/legal scales of state\/community\/forest manage-\nment plan. A map of an endangered species cuts across all\nadministrative lines and allows environmentalists to appeal\nto audiences who have no formal status in the conversation\nat all but who may form alliances with actors at any scale.\nThe relevant scale at which environmentalists and urban au-\ndiences operate is also rather poorly defined and certainly\ndoes not fit state efforts to keep things at their proper national\/\nstate\/local scales. But I would not want to push this too far:\nmy key point is that political\/epistemic alliances are being\ncreated across scales.\nIn conclusion, I would like to amplify on Choy\u2019s insightful\nremark that my article describes \u201chow a global alliance comes\ntogether through\u2014not despite\u2014cultural, epistemological,\nand geographic difference.\u201d The history of desiccation theory\nin Mexico is indeed a story of disconnection between state\nrepresentations and popular understandings and practices,\nbut it is also a story of alliance building across these differences\nof knowledge. In developed countries, states may face diffi-\nculty in producing credible public knowledge, but they are\nrelatively successful in doing so (Jasanoff 2005). This contrasts\nstrongly with Mexico, where there is widespread popular dis-\ntrust of the state, including state claims to control reason and\nscience. Forestry officials\u2019 claims to manage forests responsibly\nare widely disbelieved (Mathews 2008), while threats to water\nsupplies receive media attention and can give rise to protests.\nPopular desiccation theory is science that has escaped state\ncontrol and is now used to critique state environmental pro-\njects and to undermine or temper official claims to expertise\nand knowledge. Framings of nature, culture, human agency,\nand moral responsibility can easily be linked to desiccation\ntheory in order to provide the resources to undermine expert\nauthority and to represent the Mexican state as morally bank-\nrupt and environmentally destructive.\n\u2014Andrew S.
