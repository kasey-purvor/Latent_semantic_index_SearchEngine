INTRODUCTION\nTHE INTRODUCTION of various materials, such asmetals, their compounds, or fullerenes, into carbon nan-\notubes (CNTs) may lead to a variety of industrial applications.\nCNTs filled with ferromagnetic metals such as Fe, Ni, or Co\nhave significant potential in high-density magnetic storage\ndevices due to their size, anisotropic behavior, and enhanced\nmagnetic coercivities [1]\u2013[6]. In addition, the graphite sheets\nprovide an effective barrier against oxidation, and consequently\nManuscript received January 27, 2006; revised May 1, 2006.

One approach has the CNTs filled\nwith molten material through capillary action [8] or with metal\noxides using wet chemical techniques after opening the tube\ntop [9]. The other is an in-situ filling method, where metals or\nmetal compounds can be filled into the CNTs by the arc-dis-\ncharge technique using a graphite anode impregnated with\nthe filling material [10]. Recently, the MF-CNTs by a thermal\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD) method has also been re-\nported [1]\u2013[6]. Although thermal CVD can produce MF-CNTs\nin large quantities, it is difficult to produce vertically aligned\nMF-CNTs. From an application view point, it is desirable to\nuse plasma-enhanced CVD to produce MF-CNTs with highly\naligned and well-defined diameters and length. Although we\nhave previously reported Pd-based MF-CNTs using bias-en-\nhanced microwave PECVD (BE-MPECVD) [11], we failed\nto fill Co metal into the nanotubes using only a Co catalyst\nlayer on the Si substrate. The Co particle was detached from\nthe substrate and remained at the tip of the growing Co-based\nCNTs. In order to realize spin electronic applications by using\nMF-CNTs, it is required to fill the ferromagnetic metals into\nthe tubes of aligned CNTs.\nIn this paper, we report the Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs\nsynthesized by a BE-MPECVD using a combination of Pd\nand Co catalyst layers. BE-MPECVD grown MF-CNTs were\ncharacterized in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nand transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as energy\nfiltered electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and their\ngrowth mechanisms were modeled to describe these results.\nWe also carried out visible Raman spectroscopy to compare the\nmicrostructure between Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs and Pd-based\nMF-CNTs or Co-based hollow nanotubes (CNTs).\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nThe MF-CNTs were grown by MPECVD using a 2.45 GHz,\n1.5 kW microwave power supply. The substrate temperature\nwas controlled by a radio frequency graphite heater. A nega-\ntive bias was applied to the substrate holder to grow vertically\naligned MF-CNTs on the substrate. The Si substrates with a\nthin native oxide were cleaned in acetone by ultrasonication fol-\nlowed by deionized water and, finally, dried using a nitrogen\n1536-125X\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The substrates were then\ntreated in an acid solution H SO H O to enhance\nthe thickness of the oxide layer. Thin films of Co (6 nm) and\nPd (9 nm) were deposited on Si substrates by a thermal evap-\noration. After deposition of the catalyst layers, the substrates\nwere transferred in air to the CVD chamber. The chamber was\npumped down to a base pressure of Torr. The substrates\nwere heated to 750 C and held at this temperature for 10 min\nto sinter the catalyst layers. The feed gas, methane CH , was\nintroduced immediately and the concentration of H gas was ad-\njusted to achieve a CH H ratio of 50\/50 sccm at a total pres-\nsure of 20 Torr. A microwave power of 600 W was employed\nand a negative bias was applied to the substrate holder to grow\nvertically aligned MF-CNTs on the substrate. The MF-CNTs\nwere grown for 10 min under the conditions where a negative\nbias of 400 V was applied.\nThe MF-CNTs were observed using scanning microscopy\n(Hitachi S-300, FEI Philips XL30 sFEG) and analyzed using\na Philips CM200TEM with a LaB filament, fitted with a\nGIF2000 spectrometer. The Raman spectra were measured in\nthe back-scattering geometry using the 514.5 nm line of an Ar\nion laser at room temperature in the spectral range from 900 to\n1800 cm with a resolution of 1.0 cm .\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFig. 1(a) shows the SEM images of the Pd\/Co-based\nMF-CNTs grown on Si substrates, and in Fig. 1(b), the evo-\nlution of the catalyst after just 3 min growth of MF-CNTs.\nThe final MF-CNTs are well aligned and uniform in size on\nthe Si substrate. At lower negative substrate biases below\n300 V, randomly oriented sparse CNTs (not MF-CNTs) were\nobserved. This result indicates that a high negative substrate\nbias above 400 V is necessary to obtain well-aligned and dense\nPd\/Co-based MF-CNTs. Fig. 1(a) shows that MF-CNTs are\nwell aligned with uniform diameter and length (1 m) on Si\nsubstrates. It is seen from Fig. 1(b), that the Pd\/Co breaks into\nsmall size (about 60\u2013100 nm diameter) uniformly due to surface\ntension, as well as the stress due to mismatch of the thermal\nexpansion coefficients during the initial growth stage. For the\ncase of only Co catalyst layers, the particle was found to form\nspherical islands; different from that observed for the Pd\/Co\ncatalyst layers. The catalyst for the growth of Pd\/Co-based\nMF-CNTs should be in a molten state to encapsulate metals\ninside the tubes. The temperature of growth of Pd\/Co-based\nMF-CNTs in our case is far lower than the melting point of\nbulk Pd (1552 C) and Co (1495 C). It is well known that the\nsurface-to-volume ratio with respect to nanosize particle can\nlower the melting point. However, Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs can\ngrow even from particles with diameters from 60\u2013100 nm.\nTEM images revealed both multiwall CNTs (MW-CNTs) and\nthe herringbone (HB) or the stacked cups structure structures\non the same substrate, as shown in Fig. 2(a). In both struc-\ntures, there is the presence of the HB structure. It is reported\nthat the formation of HB-shaped CNTs could be attributed to ni-\ntrogen doping, in which nitrogen atoms are generally bonded to\ncarbon atoms in sp pyridine-like and sp bridgehead-nitrogen\ntypes [12]. Residual nitrogen may be a nitrogen precursor for\nFig. 1.

The exact reason for ex-\nisting both the tube with HB and the HB structures in the same\nsubstrate is not known up to now. Combining the TEM image\n[Fig. 2(a)] and the EELS elemental map of Co [Fig. 2(b)], the\nCo metal was successfully filled inside the MW-CNTs. In the\ncase of HB-shaped structure, Co metal was encapsulated only\nin the tips.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images of Pd\/Co-\nbased MF-CNTs grown on the Si substrate.\nThe graphite layers are parallel to the tube axis. Although some\namorphous material was observed inside the tube walls for the\nPd-based MF-CNTs [11], almost no amorphous material is ob-\nserved for Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs. Pd metal is generally con-\nsidered as an inactive metal and Co metal is considered as an\nactive metal in catalyst. Therefore, the reactivity of the catalyst\nis enhanced by combining Co with Pd and leads to a reduction of\nthe amorphous nature inside the tube walls for the Pd\/Co-based\nMF-CNTs. A large number of linear contrast features were ob-\nserved around the tip for Pd-based MFCNTs due to a lattice\nstrain induced by the solidification of Pd during cooling after\ngrowth [11]. In contrast to the Pd-based MF-CNTs, no linear\ncontrast around the tip for Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs. This indi-\ncates no lattice strain was induced by the solidification of Pd\/Co\nduring cooling after growth.\nEELS analysis was performed to identify the composition of\nthe material inside the CNTs, as shown in Fig. 4. On the basis\nof elemental analysis, we have observed not only Pd and Co but\nSi and Mo (not shown in Fig. 4) elements. Si and Mo might be\nincorporated into the metal within the CNTs from the Si sub-\nstrate. In the previous study, we have also observed Si and Mo\natoms for the Pd-based MF-CNTs [11]. The elemental maps also\nclearly reveal that both Pd and Co metals are found inside tubes\nuniformly. This result indicates that combining Co with Pd is\nessential to fill Co metal inside tubes for producing Co filled\nCNTs.\nThe first-order Raman spectra of MF-CNTs consists of\ntwo broad peaks located at 1590 cm (the peak) and\n1355 cm (the peak), as shown in Fig. 5. In compar-\nison with Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs, the Raman spectra of\nPd-based MF-CNTs reported previously [11], and multiwall\nFig. 4.

The and peaks are\nattributed to the in-plain symmetric C-C stretching and\nthe graphite materials with small crystallite sizes or so-called\ndisordered graphite, respectively. Raman spectra show an\nadditional peak at about 1620cm (denoted as ). The origin\nof the and bands in other forms carbon materials has\nbeen explained as disorder-induced features, caused by the\nfinite-particle size effects or lattice distortion [13].

While the\nbroadening of -peak was observed for Pd-based MF-CNTs\n[11], the full-width at 1\/2 maximum (FWHM) of the -peak\nfor Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs was almost the same as that of\nMWCNTs. Furthermore, no shift of the -peak position was\nobserved indicating that the structural change from graphite to\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Summary of the proposed growth model of Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs.\nnanocrystalline graphite may not be occurring by filling Pd\/Co\nmetals inside tubes [14].\nMost reports so far, conclude that the catalyst particles are\nencapsulated on the tip of the MWCNTs. The question arises\nif there is any reason preventing the metallic catalyst present\ninside the MF-CNTs. Based on TEM and SEM investigations,\nwe propose the following model to explain the Pd\/Co-based\nMF-CNTs, as schematically shown in Fig. 6. After Pd and\nCo layer deposition, the mixture of Pd and Co catalyst layers\nbecome fragmented into nanoparticles Fig. 6(a). The de-\ncomposition of CH on the surface of Pd\/Co nanoparticle\nresults in the formation of bimolecular hydrogen and carbon\natoms, and the growth of Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs is believed\nto occur via diffusion of carbon atoms through the Pd\/Co\nparticle leading to the formation of graphite layers at the lower\ncolder zone of the particle. The axis of a MF-CNT growing\nperpendicular to the substrate coincides with the direction of\nthe applied electrostatic force, resulting in a uniform tensile\nstress across the entire graphite layer\/catalyst particle interface\n[Fig. 6(b1) and (b2)]. Therefore, carbon uniformly precipitates\nacross the interface and the CNT continues to grow vertically\n(perpendicular to the substrate) [16]. The key feature of this\ngrowth model for the tube with HB is that the precipitation\nof carbon atom does not occur on the bottom surface of the\ncatalyst particle [Fig. 6(b1) and (b2)]. Therefore, the Pd\/Co\ncatalyst metals are trapped in the CNT from the basal side\nwhen the CNT was filled by Pd and Co metals [Fig. 6(c1)].\nOn the contrary, the precipitation of carbon atom occurred on\nthe bottom surface of the catalyst particle leads to elevation\nof the particle to the tip [Fig. 6(c2)]. If the carbon species are\nsupplied in a steady-state manner, the tube will grow vertically\nfor the tube with HB structure, and the HB structure will appear\nperiodically [Fig. 6(c1) and (c2)]. The growth continues until\nthe catalytic activity of the Pd\/Co. In previous reports, metals\nwere considered to be encapsulated in the hollows of CNTs by\nthe capillary force [8], [15]. Although the capillary force was\nalso active in our experiments, encapsulation was thought to\nstart at the beginning of growth of MF-CNTs.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, we report the synthesis and characteriza-\ntion of Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs. We have successfully grown\nwell-aligned Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs with uniform diameter\nand length (1 m) on Si substrates. TEM revealed multiwall\nnanotubes and the HB or stacked cups structure on the same\nsubstrate. HRTEM revealed that MF-CNTs were composed of\nhighly ordered graphene layers. Based on TEM observation\nand analysis by EELS showed that Co metal was successfully\nencapsulated into the CNTs from the basal side by combining\nCo with Pd metals. Raman results showed a low intensity of the\nband, as well as a low value of the indicate the high\nquality of Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs. Moreover, no broadening\nand no shift of the -peak were observed indicating that the\nstructural change from graphite to nanocrystalline graphite\nmay not be occurred by filling Pd\/Co metals inside tubes. A\ngrowth model for the Pd\/Co-based MF-CNTs is proposed based\non these experimental results. The key feature of the growth\nmodel for the tube with HB structure is that the precipitation\nof carbon atom does not occur on the bottom surface of the\ncatalyst particle. Finally, owing to the unique properties of the\nPd\/Co-based MF-CNTs, they have potential application for\ntips of scanning probe microscopy or high-density magnetic\nstorage devices.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
