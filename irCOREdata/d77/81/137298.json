In some\nregions of world, because of geographic location, climate and physical terrain, air\ntransport is the only viable means of transportation for both goods and people.\nPeripheral regions have two key features: low population densities and a lack of\nproximity to major economic and political centres. Motivated primarily by the\npolitical necessity to maintain cohesion within national jurisdictions, special\narrangements are usually made with regard to the provision of air services to and\nwithin these regions. The high costs associated with providing these services\ncoupled with the need to maintain and operate airport infrastructure to serve small\ncommunities, means that subsidy, in the form of grants from both national, regional\nand local levels of government, is normally required to sustain a satisfactory level of\nair service provision.\nMethods of paying subsidy and the sources of funding vary by country. For\nexample, in the United States, there exists a comprehensive system of subsidies\norganised within an Essential Air Services Programme. This was established in\nresponse to concerns regarding the future viability of air services to small\ncommunities as a result of deregulation within the domestic airline market.\n3Research undertaken during the late nineteen eighties and early nineteen nineties\nappears to validate these concerns.\nPolicy-makers in the European Commission, in formulating legislation to liberalise\nair services, implicitly recognised the possible risks to the future viability of air\nservices to peripheral communities with provisions for the imposition of Public\nService Obligations (Commission of the European Communities, 1992). These\nprovisions grant national governments of member states the authority to protect and\nsubsidise routes that are of vital socio-economic importance. Levels of subsidy and\ndecisions on which routes qualify for PSO-status are left to the discretion of each\nmember state. According to Reynolds-Feighan (1995), it is because of this that\nsignificant regional distortions exist in the quality and availability of air services to\nand within Europe\u2019s remote regions. For example, in France, approximately eighty\ndomestic routes have public service obligations imposed on them. In Scotland, on\nthe other hand, public service obligations are imposed on a limited number of ultra-\nperipheral routes.\nPublic service obligations, supported by subsidy, can guarantee for a fixed period of\ntime, continuity of air services and low fares on routes linking peripheral regions\nwith hub airports. In the absence of public service obligations, these markets are\nsubject to shifting airline strategic priorities in response to developments in global\nmarkets. Such a shift in priorities can be manifested in increased management focus\non providing services on high-density profitable networks while simultaneously\nrationalising service levels and delivery on costly and generally lower margin\nregional air service networks. Rationalisation can be achieved through franchising,\nwhere major airlines sub-contract unprofitable segments of their networks to\n4dedicated regional carriers. However, franchising also allows an airline to retain the\npresence of its brand in a franchised market. (Denton and Denis, 2000). Air\nservices that are of vital socio-economic importance to communities located in\nperipheral regions, without regulatory protection, are therefore vulnerable to changes\nin levels of provision as a consequence of these developments.\nBetween 1994 and 1996, as a result of sustained losses incurred from directly\noperating air services in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, British Airways\ndecided to franchise its operations to two UK-based regional carriers. It is within\nthis context that the aim of this paper is to identify and evaluate whether there have\nbeen any significant changes to the level of air service provision in the Highlands\nand Islands as a consequence of air service franchising.\nThe structure of this paper is laid out as follows. The following section provides a\nsummary of the socio-economic characteristics of the Highlands and Islands region,\na brief history of air service provision and the current regulatory framework within\nwhich these services are operated. The second section will examine past literature\non the subject of air service provision to peripheral regions and franchising, with\nparticular focus on the experience of small communities in the United States\nfollowing domestic air services deregulation in 1978. In the third section, the\nmethodology, research approach and sources of data will be specified. The\nfollowing section will evaluate the results, explaining any noticeable trends and\ndevelopments. The final section presents the conclusions of this paper.\n5Air Transport in the Highlands and Islands\nSocio-economic environment\nThe Scottish Highlands and Islands accounts for 13% of the land area of the British\nIsles. A sizeable proportion of this area consists of islands and mainland\ncommunities located at a significant distance from key political and economic\ndecision-making centres in both the United Kingdom and wider European Union.\nThe population of the Highlands and Islands, according to the latest statistics is\n373,000, with 61% living in settlements of less than 5,000 inhabitants (Highlands\nand Islands Enterprise, 2002). Table 3 provides population statistics for a number of\nScottish islands between 1981 and 2000. It is apparent from these statistics that all\nof the island communities listed, with the exception of Orkney, have experienced a\ndecline in population between 1981 and 2000. For example, Islay\u2019s population has\ndeclined by 14% over the entire period while on the larger island of Lewis and\nHarris, population has fallen by 8%. Worryingly, from an economic development\nperspective, the General Register of Scotland predicts a 13% decline in the\npopulation of the Western Isles between 2000 and 2016 (Western Isles, 2002).\nThe Highlands and Islands region is highly dependent on air travel where climatic\nconditions and topography can make direct surface routes torturous and inconvenient\nwhere sea fogs, high winds and heavy precipitation impacts on the punctuality and\nregularity of scheduled transportation services (UK Civil Aviation Authority, 1974).\nTable 1 provides a comparison of air service journey times with surface modes of\npublic transportation between selected locations. For example, a flight time of one\nhour between Glasgow and Stornoway in the Western Isles compares to a surface\njourney time on public transport services of just over eight hours involving three\n6different modes, ferry, coach and rail. This serves to illustrate the significant time\nadvantage air services enjoy over other modes and how dependent these regions are\non air services to ensure convenient access to mainland population centres.\nDue to low population density (9 persons per square kilometre compared with an EU\naverage of 116), economic underdevelopment and the relative inaccessibility of\ncommunities situated in the Highlands and Islands, commercial air transport in this\nregion is at worst, significantly unprofitable and at best marginally economic. This\nhas been the situation ever since the first scheduled passenger services were\nlaunched in the nineteen thirties. According to a 1974 UK Civil Aviation Authority\nreport on air services in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (UK Civil Aviation\nAuthority, 1974), three out of eighteen services operated by the then Scottish\nAirways generated an operating profit (Glasgow-Benbecula, Aberdeen-Wick and\nInverness-Wick). Nearly thirty years later, despite attempts during the early nineteen\neighties to rationalise services, according to Kyrou (1998), British Airways was\nlosing approximately US$5 million per annum on directly operating air services\nbetween the Scottish mainland and the Northern and Western Isles.\nHistory\nThe history of air transport provision in the Highlands began with the pioneering\nflights during the nineteen thirties by Scottish and Highland Airways, both carriers\nsubsequently taken-over by British European Airways (BEA) in the late nineteen\nforties. The formation of British Airways in 1974, when BEA merged with BOAC\n(British Overseas Airways Corporation) had little immediate effect on the pattern of\nair services. The first initiatives to rationalise air services were taken in 1981 with\n7the formation of the British Airways Highland Division as a profit-centre within the\nairline. These developments coincided with deregulation in the domestic market and\nthe emergence during the nineteen eighties and nineties of Loganair, as a rival to\nBritish Airways in the Highlands and Islands. Competition between both carriers\nlasted until 1994 when British Airways signed a franchise agreement with Loganair\nand the Isle of Man-based British Regional Airlines (subsequently re-named BRAL\nand then BA Citiexpress), to operate services on its behalf in the Highlands. This\ninitiative was firstly motivated by mounting financial losses the airline was incurring\non directly operating air services in this region, and secondly, a belief that\nfranchising would enable carriers better suited to operating in such an environment\nto manage these services at lower cost and at the same time maintaining and in some\ncases extending the British Airways brand in this market.\nCurrent air service provision\nAt present all scheduled services within and to the Highlands and Islands, with the\nexception of those operating between Aberdeen and Wick are operated under a\nBritish Airways Express franchise agreement either by BA Citiexpress or Loganair.\nBA Citiexpress operates services using 66-seat ATP turboprop aircraft on Aberdeen-\nSumburgh, Glasgow-Stornoway and Glasgow-Benbecula). All other routes are\noperated by Loganair; using a mixture of Saab 340s (34 seats), Shorts 360s (34\nseats), Twin Otters (20 seats) and Britten-Norman Islanders (10 seats). Due to low\nlevels of traffic, some routes are operated as multiple sectors involving intermediate\naircraft stops. For example, with regard to the two daily services between Glasgow\nand Sumburgh, one involves intermediate stops at Inverness and Kirkwall and the\n8other at Aberdeen. Many of these services also face competitive pressures from\nsubsidised passenger ferry services such as the P&O services between Aberdeen and\nScrabster to the Orkney and Shetland Islands and the state-owned Caledonian\nMacbrayne services on the west coast.\nThe map in Figure 1 shows the present structure of the Highlands and Islands\nnetwork and Table 2 lists 2001 traffic data and weekly service frequency on each\nroute in June 2001.\nRegulation and Subsidy Policy\nThe provision of air transport in the Highlands and Islands is subject to the same\nlicensing, safety and economic regulations that apply to other regions of the United\nKingdom and European Union. However, given the unremunerative nature of air\nservice provision to remote regions and driven by the political and socio-economic\nneed to integrate these communities, the UK government has, under Article 4 of\nRegulation 2408\/92 (Commission for the European Communities, 1992), imposed\npublic service obligations (PSO) on a number of routes within the region. Public\nservice obligations require a contracted air carrier to meet certain minimum service\nrequirements in return for financial compensation over a fixed period of time.\nPublic service obligations are currently on fifteen routes: Benbecula-Barra, Glasgow-\nBarra, Glasgow-Campbeltown, Glasgow-Tiree, Kirkwall-Eday, Kirkwall-Sanday,\nKirkwall-Stronsay, Kirkwall-Westray, Kirkwall-Papa Westray, Kirkwall-North\nRonaldsay, Lerwick-Foula, Lerwick-Papa Stour, Lerwick-Out Skerries, Lerwick-Fair\nIsle, and Stornoway-Benbecula.\n9Public service obligations are administered by municipal authorities on intra\u2013island\nservices in Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides while the Scottish Executive\nadministers public service obligations on routes from Glasgow. Orkney and\nShetland Islands Councils award annual subsidies of GBP170,000 and GBP232,000\nrespectively. While on Western Isles and Scottish Executive PSOs the annual\nsubsidy awarded is GBP282,000 and approximately GBP1,000,000 respectively.\nRegulatory change and services to small communities\nUnited States\nThe United States was the first country in the developed world to liberalise its\ndomestic scheduled airline market. The 1978 Airline Deregulation Act removed the\nstructure of economic controls that had regulated the provision and pricing of\nscheduled air services since 1945.\nBy the mid to late nineteen eighties there was growing concern amongst policy-\nmakers in the United States that airline strategic decisions in response to new\nopportunities offered by deregulation were adversely impacting the level of air\nservice provision to small communities. Evidence from studies undertaken during\nthis period identified shifts in airline operating priorities, with some carriers exiting\nor reducing services within and to small community markets in favour of more\nfinancially lucrative high-density routes. As a consequence of these developments,\nmany non-hub airports lost direct services. Research by Jones and Cocke (1984),\nMolloy (1985) and Khil (1988), showed that the number of direct point to point\nservices at non-hub airports declined markedly following deregulation in 1978.\nThese arguments are, however, countered by Morrison and Winston (1986) and\n10\nButler and Huston (1990) who claim that air service provision to non-hub airports\nactually improved since deregulation. This was manifested in increased flight\nfrequencies on routes to small hubs and a greater range of destinations available to\npassengers through hub and spoke scheduling.\nAnother effect of deregulation was the trend amongst carriers to down-size aircraft.\nIn liberalised markets, where airlines are competing for market share on the basis of\nimproving service frequency, load factors are optimised through reducing aircraft\nsize. Research by Huston and Butler (1988) showed that the percentage of\nturboprops deployed on the smallest city-pair markets increased from 52% in 1976\nto 91% in 1988. This points to a shift in use from jets to turboprop aircraft which\nmany passengers perceive as offering a lower quality of in-flight service due to\nincreased levels of noise and vibration compared to jet aircraft.\nEurope\nIn the European Union, the complete liberalisation of air service markets was not\nachieved until April 1997. In 2002, a licensed air carrier can legally operate between\nany two airports open to scheduled services in the European Union outside routes\nprotected by Public Service Obligations.\nStudies by the European Commission (Commission of the European Communities,\n1997) and the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (UK Civil Aviation\nAuthority, 1995) have shown that air travellers within the European Union have\nlargely benefited from deregulation. These measures encouraged carriers to compete\nwith established airlines in previously oligopolistic and monopolistic city-pair\nmarkets. Deregulation has also spawned the emergence of so called low cost \u201cno\n11\nfrills\u201d airlines offering a greater choice of discount fares than was previously\navailable. However, in evaluating the effects on a route-by-route basis, results are\ndisappointing with meaningful and effective head to head competition restricted to a\nsmall number of highly trafficked city-pairs (Commission of the European\nCommunities 1997). In light of these conclusions, one may ask to what extent has\nEU liberalisation benefited Europe\u2019s peripheral regions where traffic levels are\nsignificantly lower and air transport provision much more essential to the social and\neconomic development?\nResearch by Reynolds-Feighan (1995), who sought to identify the effects of\nliberalisation on traffic levels at small community Irish airports, found that\nliberalisation created an unstable operating environment, characterised by cyclical\nand permanent reductions in air service provision. The author cites the example of\nintense competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus during the early nineteen\nnineties which led to the eventual withdrawal of direct services from Irish regional\nairports to both London and Dublin2. In citing this example, the author argues for a\nEuropean Union-wide essential air services programme of financial assistance along\nthe same lines as that in place within the United States to protect air services to small\nand remote communities.\nIn Norway, also a country heavily dependent on air transport, domestic air service\nderegulation was initiated in 1975 with the partial relaxation of market entry\nrestrictions and the certification of new scheduled air carriers. According to\nLudvigsen (1993), small communities benefited from these measures. This was\n2 Galway, Carrickfinn, Sligo, Kerry (since re-instated) and Waterford to London and the reduction in Aer\nLingus feeder flights from these points to Dublin\n12\nmanifested in the subsequent launch of new intra and inter-regional domestic\nservices. The Norwegian government was restrained by socio-economic policy\nconsiderations from undertaking a process of complete liberalisation of the domestic\nmarket. This was due to a concern that deregulation followed by successful market\nentry would undermine the geographic integrity of the SAS and Braathens S.A.F.E\nair carrier networks which allowed for internal cross-subsidy between truck routes\nand unprofitable services to remote communities. This ability to cross-subsidise,\ntherefore obviated the need for government to directly support services to airports\nlocated in remote regions.\nFranchising air services\nAir service franchising has been adopted by a growing number of airlines both in\nEurope and in North America over the last fifteen years. Motivated by the need to\nreduce and minimise costs in a highly competitive operating environment, several\nlarge carriers have out-sourced segments of their route networks to local franchise\noperators.\nFranchisee carriers, according to Denton and Dennis (2000), as well as receiving the\nbenefits of being aligned to the a major airline brand, are able to secure access to the\nglobal network, computer reservation system and the frequent flier programme of the\nfranchiser and its other alliance partners. Franchising in Europe was pioneered by\nBritish Airways, where under the British Airways Express brand, several United\nkingdom-based carriers operate regional services on behalf of British Airways (BA\nCitiexpress, Loganair). Franchising also provides an opportunity for a large airline\n13\nto access a market at minimal cost through establishing an agreement whereby a\nregional airline directly operates services on its behalf.\nIt is apparent that there are mutual benefits to both the franchiser and the franchisee.\nHowever, to what extent has franchising affected the availability of convenient\nservices and the quality air service provision in general? One possible effect of out-\nsourcing existing services to a franchise operator is that the franchise operator is\nunable to match levels of in-flight service and punctuality previously set by the\nfranchiser. The extent to which one is able to identify if such an effect took place is\nrather limited since no research has been undertaken to validate this view.\nHowever, BRAL was heavily criticised by the North of Scotland press over poor\npunctuality not long after inheriting some Scottish internal routes from British\nAirways (Press and Journal, 1999).\nOn the other hand, it is possible that service levels in terms of increased frequency\ncould improve with the deployment of a more appropriate mix of aircraft. A report\npublished by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, on trends emerging from the single\naviation market after five years (UK Civil Aviation Authority, 1998a), showed that\nmarkets previously not served could be served if operated by a regional franchise\ncarrier. Robertson (1997) in an analysis of the effects of franchising on UK\ndomestic routes, found that significant increases in traffic were recorded on those\nroutes that become franchised and that a number of city-pairs currently without a\ndirect service could potentially support a service if it were operated as a franchise.\nDenton and Dennis (2000) in their analysis of the impact of franchising on airlines\nand consumers conclude that franchising can expand the scope and provision of air\nservices in terms of routes to new destinations and increased frequency. However,\n14\nthe authors also note that the impact may also be averse from a consumer\u2019s\nperspective since there is evidence, validated by research undertaken by the UK\nCivil Aviation Authority (UK Civil Aviation Authority, 1998a), that franchising has\nreduced competition within Europe\u2019s domestic markets while lower costs incurred\nby the franchisee have yet to feed through into lower fares for the consumer.\nResearch Approach and Data Sources\nThe aim of this paper is to identify the effects of franchising, which occurred\nbetween 1994 and 1996, on air service provision in the Highlands and Islands of\nScotland.\nAnalysis is based on contrasting the level and quality of service provision in 1998\nand 2001 with the period 1983 to 1993 using the following measures:\n\uf0b7 Frequency. Measures of total network frequency and average frequency per\nroute are obtained. Statistics are complied from the ABC\/OAG World Airways\nGuide for the month of June in the following years: 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998 and\n2001.\n\uf0b7 Maximum lapsed destination time. Maximum lapsed destination time (METD),\nmeasures the total lapsed time between the earliest daily arrival time and the\nlatest daily departure time at a given location on a specific route. This variable\nis able to measure the relative convenience of departure and arrival times from\nthe perspective of the day-trip passenger. Statistics were complied from the\nsame source as that obtained for weekly service frequency.\n\uf0b7 Seating capacity per flight. Past research has shown that most passengers prefer\ntravelling on jet aircraft as opposed to turboprops and larger aircraft as opposed\n15\nto small (Kanafani and Ghobrial, 1985, Ghobrial, 1989). Average seating\ncapacity per flight measures the size of aircraft deployed on a given route and is\nused to identify if a specific market has experienced an increase or decrease in\naverage aircraft size. Statistics were complied from the same source as that\nobtained for weekly service frequency.\n\uf0b7 In-flight time. In-flight time measures the amount of time spent by a passenger\nin-flight on a specific route. This is determined by published scheduled\ndeparture and arrival times. Where there are different aircraft types deployed on\na route, an average is obtained, weighted by the service frequency associated\nwith each aircraft type.\nAnalysis will also focus on assessing changes in patterns of air services within the\ncontext of whether franchise carriers were better able to manage capacity in relation\nto traffic.\nThe sample of routes selected for analysis, including sector distances, are listed in\nTable 4. Only those routes that were directly affected by franchising and were\noperated commercially (non-PSO) throughout the entire period were considered for\nanalysis.\nResults\nWeekly service frequency\nOne-way service frequency, aggregated across all routes, increased by a factor of 4%\nbetween 1983 and 2001, from 133 to 138 weekly flights. According to Figure 2\naverage weekly frequency per route, over the same period, increased marginally\n16\nfrom 11.08 to 11.50 flights per week. Average weekly frequency weighted by route\ndensity increased from 14.04 to 14.83 services per week during the same period.\nBetween 1988 and 1993 there is 23% increase in weighted average frequency per\nroute. This is as a result of Loganair\u2019s expansion of services between 1991 and 1993\nand an increase in frequency supplied by British Airways on Aberdeen-Sumburgh,\nGlasgow-Stornoway and Inverness-Stornoway.\nEvaluating individual route service frequency trends in Table 5 shows that while in\nsome markets, service levels have largely remained unchanged over the entire\nperiod, frequency has increased by the highest amounts on services between\nEdinburgh and Kirkwall, Aberdeen and Kirkwall and Inverness and Stornoway. On\nEdinburgh-Kikrwall, where most services involve an intermediate stop at either\nInverness or Wick, service frequency increased from five round-trips in 1983 to\ntwelve in 2001. Both markets also recorded increases in frequency between 1993 and\n2001, after services were franchised. As a result of franchising the only significant\nreductions in frequency between 1993 and 2002 were recorded on Glasgow-\nKirkwall, Glasgow-Stornoway and Kirkwall-Sumburgh while frequency on\nInverness-Kirkwall increased by a factor of 50% during this period\nFranchising appears not to have had an adverse effect on total network service\nfrequency, while the decline in average frequency per route appears not to have been\nsignificant.\nHowever, one disadvantage in adopting frequency as a measure of the level and\nquality of service is that no indication is provided as to the convenience of departure\nand arrival times on a given route.\n17\nMaximum Lapsed Destination Time (MLDT)\nSchedule convenience can be measured by calculating Maximum Lapsed Destination\nTime (MLDT) in both directions for each city-pair. MLTD measures the total lapsed\ntime between the earliest daily arrival time and the latest daily departure time at a\ngiven location on a specific route.\nFigure 3 shows that there has been a steady and consistent improvement in both\nsimple and weighted average MLDT over the period 1983 to 2001. Weighted\nMLDT increases quite markedly from 6.06 hours in 1993 to 7.27 hours in 2001,\nwhile the simple average increases from 5.94 hours to 6.90 hours over the same\nperiod.\nObservation of statistics listed in Table 6 shows that there is significant variation in\nabsolute levels of MLDT between and within city-pair markets, in the latter case\nthrough directional differences in absolute levels and in growth rates between each\nperiod. To a large extent, differences within and between city-pairs are as a result of\nscheduling and aircraft over-night positioning decisions taken by airlines. From\n1983 to 1993, there is little change in MLDT, with a few exceptions. For example,\non services from Aberdeen to Kirkwall, MLDT increases by 67%. While on services\nfrom Inverness to Glasgow, there is a fall of 64%.\nAfter 1993, following the franchising of air services, significant changes are\napparent across most routes up to 2001. Large increases were recorded on Inverness-\nGlasgow (173%) and Stornoway-Inverness (321%). Only five out of the sixteen\ndirectional routes recorded reductions in MLDT, Kirkwall-Aberdeen, Glasgow-\nInverness, Glasgow-Stornoway, Sumburgh-Kirkwall and Stornoway-Glasgow. The\n18\nimpact of franchising, therefore, on MLDT appears largely to have been positive.\nFor example, in 1993, a passenger departing from Inverness to Glasgow could only\nspend a maximum of 4.25 hours in Glasgow before having to return on the last\nflight. BRAL, which operated the route in 1998, restored the early morning\ndeparture from Inverness, thus allowing passengers 11.17 hours in Glasgow.\nLoganair also introduced for the first time a morning departure from Stornoway to\nInverness and an early evening return thereby increasing MLDT on Stornoway-\nInverness by 321% over the period 1993-2001\nAverage Seating Capacity per Flight\nIn the Highlands and Islands, because of low traffic volumes, all internal air services\nhave been and still are operated by turboprop aircraft. Figure 4 below shows that\naverage seating capacity per flight increased from 35.5 in June 1983 to 52.2 in June\n1993. Up to 1991, British Airways services were operated by 44-seat British\nAerospace 748 turboprops. These were then replaced by 66-seat British Aerospace\nATPs. This explains the sharp increase in both simple and weighted average aircraft\nsize between 1988 and 1993. Rival carrier Loganair, prior to 1994, was operating a\nmix of De-Havilland Twin-Otters, BAe Jetstream 31s, Shorts 360s, and Britten-\nNorman islanders, all aircraft with less than forty seats.\nWhen British Airways services were franchised to BRAL and Loganair, ten out of\nthe twelve routes sampled recorded a reduction in average seating capacity per flight\nof between 4% and 47% between 1993 and 2001. For example, according to Table\n7, average aircraft seating capacity per flight fell by 47% between 1993 and 2001 on\n19\nservices between Aberdeen and Kirkwall. This is because BRAL replaced ATP\nturboprops, previously operated by British Airways, with smaller 34-seat Saab 340s.\nSimilar scale reductions were recorded on other routes (Kirkwall-Sumburgh,\nGlasgow-Inverness) where ATP turboprops were replaced by older non-pressurised\n34-seat Shorts 360 aircraft. These results suggest that service levels from the\nperspective of aircraft size have declined in so far as passengers travelling within\nand from the Highlands and Islands have had to endure the discomfort of not only\nsmaller, but in some cases, non-pressurised aircraft as a direct consequence of\nfranchising. However, it should be pointed out that between 1998 and 2001,\nLoganair was in the process of replacing its ageing non-pressurised Shorts 360 fleet\nwith faster and pressurised Saab 340 turboprops.\nIn-flight time\nPassenger\u2019s perception of the quality of service offered in a given market is, to a\nlarge extent, influenced by the amount of time spent in-flight between any two\nairports.\nFigure 5 illustrates changes in simple and weighted average in-flight time per route\nbetween 1983 and 2001. In June 1983, average in-flight time was 0.83 hours per\nroute. By June 1988, this had increased marginally to 0.86 hours. As far as weighted\naverage in-flight time is concerned, there is no change between June 1983 and June\n1988. Between 1988 and 1993, both simple and weighted average in-flight time\ndecline to 0.79 hours and 1.03 hours respectively.\n20\nUp to 1993, the deployment of new and faster aircraft by both Loganair and British\nAirways was largely responsible for the decline in both average and weighted\naverage in-flight time.\nFranchising appears to have had the effect of reducing further, with the exception of\na very slight increase in the simple average between 1993 and 1998, average in-flight\ntime across the network. These trends occurred in spite of the fact slower Shorts 360\naircraft were being deployed in place of faster ATPs on a number of routes\n(Inverness-Glasgow, Inverness-Kirkwall, Edinburgh-Kirkwall, Kirkwall-Sumburgh\nand Glasgow-Kirkwall). The decline in average in-flight time is mainly due to an\nincrease in the number of non-stop direct flights across the network. Figure 6 shows\nthat the number of direct non-stop services as a percentage of total direct services\ndeclined from 77% in June 1983 to 66% in June 1993. However, as smaller aircraft\nare introduced to the network after franchising, a greater number of direct services\nare introduced increasing the proportion to 85% in June 1998.\nAnalysis of city-pair in-flight time data listed in Table 8 illustrates the combined\neffect of replacing direct with one-stop flights and vice-versa, and reducing aircraft\nsize on in-flight time. For example, on services between Aberdeen and Kirkwall, the\nreplacement of the 66-seat British Aerospace ATP with the 34-seat Saab 340\noperated by BRAL did not affect in-flight time since the Saab 340, despite its lower\nseating capacity, is able to match cruising speeds achieved by the ATP.\nFurthermore, in 1993, five of the seventeen weekly flights between Aberdeen and\nKirkwall involved an intermediate stop in Inverness, whereas in 1998 and 2001 all\nflights between both airports were non-stop.\n21\nIn-flight time increases by the largest amount between 1993 and 2001 on Glasgow-\nKirkwall and Edinburgh-Kirkwall. Prior to franchising, Loganair operated direct\nservices on these routes in competition with British Airways using newly acquired\nBritish Aerospace Jetstream 31s. However, as a result of the re-structuring that\nfollowed the franchise agreement, both routes were eventually handed over to BRAL\nin 1994 who replaced direct non-stop services with one-stop flights operated by non-\npressurised Shorts 360s involving intermediate stops at Inverness and Aberdeen. The\neffect of this was to increase average in-flight time on Edinburgh and Glasgow\nservices respectively. However, services between Aberdeen and both Sumburgh and\nKirkwall experienced a reduction in-flight time due to the replacement of direct one-\nstop with non-stop flights. Despite the substitution of ATPs with the smaller Saab\n340 on the Kirkwall-Aberdeen route, there was no adverse effect on in-flight time\nsince the Saab 340 is able to match cruising speeds achieved by the ATP.\nFranchising which coincided with the deployment of smaller aircraft on the\nHighlands and Islands network appears to have been responsible for the overall\nreduction in in-flight time. Before 1993, British Airways was operating 66-seat\nATP\u2019s which could only be operated commercially on a multi-sector basis, hence the\nlow proportion of direct non-stop services in June 1993. However, the franchise\ncarriers, especially Loganair, have a more appropriate mix of equipment for the\nmarket and were thus able to offer more direct services and a reduction in in-flight\ntime.\nManagement of supply and demand\n22\nWithout the benefit of government subsidies or cross-crediting revenue from\nprofitable routes, air carriers operating in low-density markets are driven by the\ncommercial necessity of recovering costs and generating a return on their\ninvestment. This can pose a particular economic challenge in an environment of\ncomparatively high infrastructure use charges and low traffic volumes. Therefore,\nan analysis of service provision would be incomplete without adequate consideration\nof the management and deployment of capacity in relation to developments in the\nvolume of passenger traffic\nTable 9 provides a breakdown of seating capacity, passenger traffic levels and\npassenger load factor on routes within the Highlands and Islands. Statistics are\nseparated into East Coast and West Coast services. Total passenger traffic on\nservices in the Highlands and Islands increases from 17,821 in June 1983 to 31,053\nin June 2001, an average annual growth rate of 4.1%. This compares to an average\nannual growth rate of 2.7% in seating capacity. Total load factor in June 1983 was\n67%, increasing to 73% in June 1988.\nBetween 1988 and 1993, the combined effect of additional Loganair services and the\nreplacement of BAe 748 turboprops with larger ATPs on the British Airways\nnetwork results in a reduction in load factor on both East and West Coast route\nsectors. For example, load factor on services between the mainland (Glasgow,\nInverness) and Western Isles (Stornoway, Benbecula, Islay) declines from 65% in\nJune 1988 to 53% in June 1993. Load factor also falls on the East Coast route\nnetwork from 79% to 63% over the same period 3.\n3 It should also be borne in mind that these statistics relate to the month of June and one would expect lower\nload factors between October and March.\n23\nWhat is also interesting is that levels of traffic and the deployment of capacity have\nnot been affected by declining population levels of some of the island communities\nreported in Table 3 if one contrasts the situation in 2001 with 1983. However, it is\nimportant to note that traffic levels on some of the mainland-western isles have\nactually fallen between 1998 and 2001. For example, the total number of passengers\ncarried on Glasgow-Islay in 2001 was 19,609 compared to 19,914 in 1998. This\ntrend may be as a result of two factors; de-population or changes in service levels\nand prices on competing ferry services.\nIncreased competition during the period 1991-1994 between British Airways and\nLoganair and the deployment of large aircraft had the combined effect of creating an\nenvironment of excess capacity. For example, Loganair introduced direct services,\nfor the first time between Glasgow and Kirkwall in competition with daily British\nAirways services which were routed through Aberdeen and Inverness in June 1993.\nHowever, such a strategy could not be sustained in the face of mounting financial\nlosses incurred by British Airways in operating services directly in the Highlands\nand islands. Hence, the commercial logic in seeking to co-operate rather than\ncompete with rival Loganair.\nWhere competition, though limited, has existed before, the effect of the franchise\nagreement was to make the British Airways brand dominant in the Highlands. The\nfranchise agreement allowed for the air carriers to establish more financially\nsustainable network of services through adjustments in frequency, routings, capacity\nand aircraft type. The franchise carriers were able to achieve significantly higher\nload factors, 79% in June 2001 compared to 59% in June 1993. Indeed, load\nfactors, which had been comparatively low on west coast routes between 1983 and\n24\n1998, had improved markedly by June 2001. The main reason for this is that\nLoganair had replaced BRAL on the Inverness-Stornoway route and were offering a\nreduced level of capacity (ATP\u2019s replaced by Saab 340s) but interestingly a more\nconvenient schedule of services (see Table 6). What is apparent from these\ndevelopments is that the rationalisation and consolidation which was inevitable in an\nenvironment of excess capacity, was achieved without any significant deterioration\non service levels. Indeed, many aspects of air service provision improved, such as,\nthe convenience of flight timings, reduced in-flight times and introduction of new\nroutes as a consequence of franchising.\nConclusions\nAir services were franchised by British Airways in order to reduce costs and to\neliminate the mounting losses incurred in operating services directly. Franchise\ncarriers, through using a amore appropriate size and mix of aircraft were better able\nto achieve higher load factors and a more commercial successful operation. In spite\nof the fact that passengers had to endure the relative discomfort and inconvenience\nof smaller aircraft as a result of downsizing, franchising has brought improved\ndeparture and arrival times, shorter journeys, and fewer multi-stop services.\nFranchising has also resulted in new routes such as Edinburgh-Stornoway and a new\ndirect non-stop service between Edinburgh and Sumburgh. Furthermore, the\ninconvenience suffered by the travelling public as a result of having to endure non-\npressurised flight may be short lived as Loganair are in the process of deploying\nadditional pressurised Saab 340 aircraft.\n25\nFrom the operator\u2019s perspective the over-provision in air services that was clearly\napparent in 1993 could not be sustained and that the reduction in capacity was\nnecessary in an environment of low traffic volumes and high costs4. These were the\nkey factors that prompted British Airways to franchise its Highlands and Islands\nservices to BRAL and Loganair. Both airlines were better able to serve the market\nthrough a combination of lower costs and more suitable aircraft types.\nAlthough this paper is rather limited in its geographic scope, it has sought to\nexamine how franchising has impacted on the provision of air services in one of\nEurope\u2019s peripheral regions. It is also very important to point out that enhanced\nservice levels have been achieved without the imposition of public service\nobligations with their fixed minimum levels of service and financial compensation.\nHowever, the extension of British Airways dominant position in the Highlands and\nIslands may have negative implications in that the franchise carriers who now\ncontrol almost all scheduled routes would have incentives to exercise monopoly\npower through setting excessive air fares. Indeed, there has emerged anecdotal\nevidence at the time of writing which appears to suggest that the level of air fares\nacross the Highlands and Islands air services network is perceived by the local\npopulation to be very high (Press and Journal, 2002). While this perception in part\nhas been fuelled by expectations of low fares generated by low cost airlines\noperating on the main trunk markets, this presents a very real problem for policy-\nmakers. Detailed research into the level of air fares, before and after franchising and\n4 British Airways for example, was reported to have been loosing approximately US$5 million per annum on\nservices between the mainland and island communities.\n26\nan analysis of the potential scope for competition would represent a very useful\ncontribution to the current debate on air services in the Highlands and Islands.\nReferences\nABC,. 1993a World Airways Guide Trade Edition A-M, June edition.
