Many surviving late medieval buildings erected \nwholly or partially in brick have been substantially altered since their original construction and \nthe cumulative effect of many alterations requires detailed examination to unravel the \ncomplex structural history of the building. Such analysis, particularly when combined with \ndocumentary evidence and tree-ring dating of timbers, comprises the conventional approach \nto historic buildings analysis, and one which has the capability to date the original \nconstruction and subsequent alterations to within several years or better. However, problems \nin dating may arise, particularly in the study of vernacular buildings, where documentary \nevidence has not survived, or may have never existed, where tree-ring dates are not \navailable (such as the replacement of original structural timbers, insufficient number of rings, \netc.), and where there is an absence of diagnostic architectural features. In these \ncircumstances the uncertainty in dating may rise to at least several decades, depending on \nthe nature of the available building evidence. This paper discusses the results obtained from \na program of luminescence dating of brick from a group of independently dated late-medieval \nand post-medieval English buildings with the purpose of evaluating the potential of the \nmethod in the interpretation and phasing of buildings of this period. \n \nThe use of brick in medieval England \nUnlike the building traditions of continental W. Europe, there was a long interregnum \nfollowing the departure of the Romans from Britain, during which brick was not manufactured \nuntil its relatively late reintroduction towards the end of the C12th (Moore, 1991; Salzman, \n1967). Evidence of the earliest known local production of medieval brick is found in buildings \nin Essex, although there are examples elsewhere of early medieval buildings where it is \n 4 \nuncertain whether ceramic tiles and bricks incorporated into the structure were re-used or of \nlocal contemporary manufacture (Clifton-Taylor, 1962; Wight, 1972; Ryan, 1996). It is known \nthat some brick was imported from the Low Countries during the C13th and C14th for the \nconstruction of high status buildings, but there is documentary evidence for the emergence of \na commerce in brick manufacture in detailed records related to brick production in Hull \n(Yorkshire) and Wisbech (Cambridgeshire) during the early C14th (Brooks, 1939; Sherlock, \n1998; Smith, 1985). In the county of Lincolnshire, lying between these two known examples \nof production centres, locally produced brick is found in standing buildings that survive from \nthe late C14th, although many of these buildings tend to be isolated rather than in urban \nsettings (Smith, 1985). During the C15th the use of brick became fashionable in E. England \nand the number of brickyards and brickmaking sites expanded to meet local needs, rising to \na peak of nearly 200 production centres in the late C19th (Robinson, 1999), facilitated by the \nwidespread availability of suitable clays (Miller and Robinson, 1989). However it is only \nrecently that archaeological work to classify basic brick fabric types has commenced (A. \nVince, pers. comm.).  \n \nApart from the work performed in our laboratory on buildings in Newcastle upon Tyne (Bailiff \nand Holland, 2000) and Suffolk (Antrobus, 2004), only very limited work on the luminescence \ndating of brick from buildings in England has been performed (Cramp et al., 1977). This in \ncontrast to work performed elsewhere in Europe where the potential of the application of the \nmethod to the study the architectural history of buildings was recognised at an earlier stage \nin the development of luminescence dating (Goedicke et al., 1981). More recent work on \nstanding buildings in Europe has included applications in Finland (Jungner, 1987; H\u00fctt et al., \n2001), Germany (G\u00f6ksu and Schwenk, 2001), Italy (Martini and Sibilia, 2001), Denmark \n(Abrahamsen et al., 1998) and the Czech Republic (\u010cechak et al., 2000).  \n \nWhereas the earlier work exploited higher levels of precision that can be obtained with the \nthermoluminescence (TL) fine grain technique (polymineral grains of 4-11 m dia.), some of \n 5 \nthe more recent applications (e.g., H\u00fctt et al., 2001) have employed the quartz inclusion \ntechnique (quartz grains of typically 90-150 m dia.) that is based on the measurement of the \n210\u02daC TL peak. The latter was found to be a sensitive technique for use in retrospective \ndosimetry (Bailiff and Petrov, 1999) with modern bricks, prompting its application to dating. \nStudies of the kinetics of the trap(s) associated with the peak (Petrov and Bailiff, 1997; \nG\u00f6ksu et al., 2001) indicated its suitability in terms of trap lifetime for application to dating \nduring the last millennium.  \n \nThe use of quartz avoids anomalous fading that is associated with feldspar minerals and \nwhich, if present, causes an underestimation of the age due to loss of the latent \nluminescence signal (Aitken, 1985). The degree of signal loss is unpredictable and needs to \nbe assessed for each sample, although recent studies suggest that it is positively correlated \nwith K content in feldspars (Meisl and Huntley, 2005).  When performing measurements with \nfine grain samples extracted from brick, the proportions of the detected luminescence due to \nfeldspar and quartz will depend on the type of clay and the firing conditions, and the extent of \nthe influence of the former may vary considerably.  Although the results obtained with north \nItalian brick appear to have been both precise and accurate using the polymineral fine-grain \ntechnique (Goedicke et al.,1981), we have found its reliability when applied to English \nceramic materials to be inconsistent, and attempts to remove feldspars using various acid \netching procedures have generally not yielded satisfactory samples. The extraction of \nfeldspar inclusions is also a further possibility to consider, but still requires testing for \nanomalous fading.  Athough we have not undertaken a comprehensive survey of the \nperformance of different techniques, dating work with English brick in this laboratory has \nfocused on the extraction of quartz inclusions, and in earlier work the measurement of \noptically stimulated luminescence (OSL) with quartz was found to offer advantages in terms \nof signal sensitivity (Bailiff and Holland, 2000) compared with thermoluminescence (TL).  \n \n \n 6 \nTHE BUILDINGS \nBrick samples were obtained from a group of seven late- and post-medieval buildings in \nEngland, six of which are located in Lincolnshire and one in Wiltshire. They were selected \nfrom a wider group of buildings currently under study and include late- and post- medieval \nbuildings for which independent dating evidence is available. The assigned dates derived \nfrom the latter were based on a combination of structural analysis, documentary records and, \nfor some of the buildings, included tree-ring dates for structural or roof timbers. The principal \ndetails of the buildings sampled, comprising Tattershall Castle, Doddington Hall, \nAyscoughfee Hall, Alford Manor, Boston Guildhall and Fydell House located in Lincolnshire, \nand Clarendon House located in S E Wiltshire, are summarised in Table 1.  Of these, five \n(Alford Manor, Ayscoughfee, Doddington, Boston Guildhall and Tattershall) are sufficiently \nclosely dated to be considered as dating \u2018controls\u2019, and the later buildings, Fydell House and \nClarendon House, although chronologically less tightly constrained, provide examples of \ntesting phases of construction. \n \nThe construction of the Great Tower of Tattershall Castle (Lab. ref. 318) started in ca A.D. \n1434 (Salzman, 1967).  The massive brick solar tower, four stories in height (35.5 m),  \nrepresented a stunning addition to a group of earlier manorial buildings, and aspects of its \nconstruction and  function within the built landscape are discussed by Everson and Stocker \n(2007). Surviving accounts for 1445-46 record that the tower was constructed under the \nsupervision of a Flemish \u2018brekemaker\u2019, Baldwin, and that 322,000 bricks were supplied for \nthe construction of its base. (Simpson, 1955). Two brick samples were obtained from the \ninterior walls of, one each from the NE and NW towers at the ground floor and the basement \nlevels respectively.  \n \nDoddington Hall (Lab. ref. 317), Doddington, is a late Elizabethan house that was built in \nbrick between 1593 and 1600 by Thomas Tailor; the design, based on an elongated H plan, \nis attributed to Robert Smythson who was the distinguished designer of a group of advanced \n 7 \nlate Elizabethan Midland houses (Pevsner et al., 1989). An indenture dated 1593 records the \nsale of the Doddington Estate to Thomas Tailor (see note to Table 1), and a sheet of lead \nmarked \u2018IW 1600\u2019 recovered from the cladding of the centre dome marks the completion of \nthe Hall in 1600 (Jarvis, pers. comm.). Two samples (317-1a, -1b) were obtained from an \ninternal foundation wall in the south wing directly below the ground floor. The bricks were \nproduced locally with clay obtained within local beds.  \n \nSt Mary\u2019s Guildhall (Lab. ref. 310), Boston, although having undergone much rebuilding and \nalteration, has extant original timber framework and external brickwork are considered to be \nlargely original (Pevsner et al., 1989). A recent structural investigation (Clark et al. 2003) \nplaced the date of its initial construction to 1390 on the basis of tree-ring analysis of the \nframing and roof timbers (Howard, 2003). As a result of this work it has a special status as \none of the earliest surviving brick buildings in Lincolnshire. Two samples of brick were taken \nfrom the exterior of the N elevation of the building, one associated with original phase of \nconstruction the building (310-1) and the other an adjoining mid C19th extension (310-2), \ntaken for comparison. \n \nAyscoughfee Hall (Lab. ref. 319), Spalding, is a much altered building that was originally built \non an H-plan. Previously considered to have been constructed in 1429 (Pevsner et al., \n1989), a recent structural assessment of the building, Clark and Mellor, 2005), supported by \ntree-ring dating of 34 roof timbers, proposes that the house was erected during the early \n1450\u2019s. Two cores were taken from an internal gable wall associated with the original \nstructure and located within the roof space (319 -1, -2). \n \nAlford Manor, Alford (Lab. ref. 301), was until recently considered to have originated as a \n\u2018mud and stud\u2019 C16th house built on an H-plan with a thatched roof, and later (1661) \nencased in brick (Pevsner et al., 1989). Samples of brick were obtained from two locations, \none at the rear corner of what was considered to be the mid C17th brick encasement (301-1) \n 8 \nand the other, for comparison, from a later C18th extension (301-2). A recent analysis by \nClark and Nash (2003) that includes tree-ring dates for structural timbers from both the roof \nand frame elements (Arnold et al., 2003) provides a detailed account of the construction \nhistory. It concludes that the building was erected as a composite timber frame and brick \nstructure and that construction followed shortly after A.D. 1611, which corresponds to the \ndate obtained by tree-ring analysis for the felling of the timbers. \n \nFydell House (Lab. ref. 311), Boston, is described as a grand early C18th house (Pevsner et \nal., 1989) constructed of brick on two levels and located adjacent to Boston Guildhall. \nIronwork, embossed with the year 1726, and a date impressed brick mark the transfer of \nownership of the house to Mr Fydell in that year, and alterations in the brickwork suggest \nsome structural alterations were made. Apart from restoration of the upper floor following fire \ndamage during the Second World War, the building has remained largely original since 1726 \nand is considered to be a  fine example of the style of its period. Of six samples taken from \nthis building at ground floor level and the garden walls, three (311 -2, -4, -6) from the main \nhouse are discussed in this paper, one of which (311-6) is putatively associated with \nreconstruction of the front fa\u00e7ade. \n \nClarendon House, Wiltshire (Lab. Ref. 315) is reported to have been built in 1737 (Pevsner, \n1975), but is considered to be stylistically earlier. It has been the subject of recent \narchitectural and documentary research as part of a wider study of the medieval royal deer \npark and later estate (Beaumont James and Gerrard, 2006). Structural analysis indicates that \nthe mansion has two main phases of construction. A brick core (315-4) was taken from an \ninternal wall associated with the first phase and further core (315-5) was obtained from the \ninternal face of the front elevation associated with the second phase of construction. \nTraditions of brickmaking on the estate suggest that the materials were locally sourced. The \nearliest phase is dated stylistically to the mid\u2013late C17th, supported by tree-ring analysis that \nindicates the youngest structural timbers were felled after 1667 (Tyers, 1999). The date of \n 9 \n1737 given by Pevsner derives from a datestone, but in a recent expert assessment the third \nnumeral of the datestone was judged to be sufficiently unclear to give rise to uncertainty as \nto whether the date was 1717 or 1737 (Gerrard, pers. comm.). The earlier date coincides \nwith a change in ownership of the estate to the Bathurst family. Taking into account the \nrange of available evidence, the current date range for the second phase cannot be refined \nto closer than 1717-1737.  \n \nEXPERIMENTAL \nAs discussed in more detail below, the quartz inclusion technique (Aitken, 1985; 1998) was \napplied to determine the luminescence age of the brick samples discussed in this paper. The \nage, A, is calculated by determining experimentally the values of the palaeodose, P, and the \ntotal dose-rate, D\uf026 tot, to enable the age equation to be evaluated: \n \ntotD\nP\nA  \u00b1 A  ; \u00b1 B  (1) \nwhere  D\uf026 tot = a D\uf026\n +  b D\uf026  + g D\uf026 + D\uf026 cos .  \n \nD\uf026 is the alpha dose-rate due to alpha emitters within the interior of the quartz grains, a is \nthe a value (Aitken, 1985) that accounts for the lower yield of luminescence per unit of \nabsorbed dose, D\uf026  and  D\uf026   are the point-absorber infinite medium beta and gamma dose-\nrates respectively, b is a lumped correction factor related to the attenuation of beta radiation \nby quartz grains, taking into account the reduction in grain size due to HF etching,  and \ndifferences in the absorption coefficient between ceramic and water, g is a lumped correction \nfactor related the geometry of the sources of gamma radiation and to differences in the \nabsorption coefficient between ceramic and water, and where D\uf026 cos is the cosmic ray dose-\nrate (Prescott and Hutton, 1988). The process of HF etching quartz grains is assumed to \nreduce the dose-rate contribution from external sources of alpha particles to a negligible \nlevel. \n 10 \n \nThe age is given with two error terms based on the specification by Aitken (1985). The first \nerror term, A, is a type A standard uncertainty (ISO, 1993) obtained by an analysis of \nrepeated observations and the second error term, B, is a type B standard uncertainty based \non an assessment of uncertainty associated with all the quantities employed in the \ncalculation of the age, including those of type A, and  is equivalent  to the overall error \ndescribed by Aitken (1985) . Expressions for both terms are derived from an analysis of the \npropagation of errors (see Aitken, 1985) when calculating the age using measured and \ncalculated values, and hitherto this approach has been generally considered to be sufficiently \nrobust. Unless stated otherwise, all the uncertainties discussed in this paper are given as \n\u00b11 . \n \nBrick sampling \nSamples of brick were obtained using a diamond faced core drill of 50 mm diameter \ndesigned for dry cutting except in two cases where a whole brick was extracted (318-1b) and \nwhere a smaller core drill (38 mm dia.) was used (311-6). The drill speed and pressure \napplied during the cutting were adjusted to prevent excessive heating. With one exception \n(318), the contexts were generally dry for the locations discussed in this paper. The cores, \nonce cut, were marked to indicate their location and orientation and packed in heavy gauge \nplastic tubing.  Where the sampled location required cosmetic restoration, the brick cavities \nwere back-filled with lime-based mortar and the surface impregnated with brick dust, and in \nsome cases a cap cut from the core was inserted to reduce the amount of exposed mortar \nwithin the brick.  A dosemeter capsule (glass tube, 3 mm-thick walls) containing dosimetry \ngrade aluminium oxide (Al2O3:C; Landauer Inc., USA) was inserted into a hole drilled near to \nthe core location to a measured depth (usually 10 cm), that was sufficient to place it in the \nrear half of the brick. The aluminium oxide records the combined dose\u2013rate due to gamma \nand cosmic radiation while the beta rays from the surrounding material are absorbed within \n 11 \nthe tube walls. At some of the locations the gamma ray spectrum was measured using a NaI \ndetector, Ametek) placed into the core cavity \u2013 the data obtained were used as a back-up to \nthe dosemeter measurements and were not applied to dose-rate calculations discussed \nbelow.  \n \nPreparation of Samples \nFollowing the removal of any residual mortar deposits, the cores (or bricks) were cut using a \nwater lubricated diamond saw to obtain slices of controlled depth and thickness. A general \nassessment of the composition of the brick fabric was made using a low power stereo \nmicroscope by examining a cut surface (usually an end cap cut from the inner core surface) \nto examine for heterogeneity of the fabric due to rock fragments or agglomerations (Kaipa et \nal., 1988), both of which may cause significant local variations in the beta dose-rate to \nindividual grains. A ~10 mm thick slice was cut between 8 and 10 cm from the front surface \nof the brick, the exact depth depending on the composition and condition of the core. This \nthickness of slice usually provided sufficient material for both beta dose-rate and \nluminescence measurements, sampling for both from the same material volume being \nrelevant in the case of non-uniform fabric composition. The slices were subsequently \nexamined under red light to compare the fabric composition against the initial assessment. \n \nQuartz inclusions  \nQuartz inclusions were extracted from the selected sieved fraction (as discussed below) by \nfollowing a procedure based on that developed for the quartz inclusion technique (Aitken, \n1985). After removal of the outer 1- 2 mm rim of the slice and a portion for dose-rate \nassessment, the slice was mechanically crushed and the material dry sieved to isolate the \ngrain size fractions in the ranges <90 \u00b5m, 90-150 \u00b5m and 150-355 \u00b5m. Although the 90-150 \n\u00b5m fraction is preferred in this laboratory because it corresponds to the grain size range used \nin the primary beta source calibration, its availability in sufficient quantity depends on the \n 12 \ncoarseness of the temper, and in the case of bricks from location 319 the use of a finer \ntemper necessitated the extraction of a smaller grain size range (53-90 m). \n \nFollowing a test for the presence of carbonates, the sieved fraction was etched in HF (40%, \nfor 45 mins), immersed in HCl for 60 mins to remove precipitates, and finally re-sieved, with \nappropriate washing procedures applied at each stage. The quality of the etched material \nwas assessed by visual examination of one or more aliquots under a low power microscope. \nThe presence of feldspars in the etched material was tested by measuring the response of \naliquots to infra-red stimulation following the application of a laboratory beta dose and pre-\nheat treatment \u2013 no significant IRSL was detected for the samples discussed in this paper \nand heavy liquid separation was considered to be unnecessary. \n \nPolymineral fine grains \nPolymineral fine grain discs were also prepared with several samples (samples 310-1,-2; \n301-1,-2 and 311-2) to obtain dates for comparison with the quartz inclusion results. They \nwere prepared following the conventional fine-grain procedure (Aitken, 1985).  \n \n \nDetermination of palaeodose  \nInstrumentation \nLuminescence measurements were performed using a TL-DA-12 semi-automated reader \n(Ris\u00f8 National Laboratory, Denmark). Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) was detected \nafter passing through a Hoya U340 filter (7.5 mm), and OSL decay curves were recorded \nusing either blue diode (470 nm; ~50 mW cm-2 ) or filtered tungsten-halogen (450-550 nm; \n~30 mW cm-2) stimulation sources. As part of the initial testing procedure, the TL signal from \nquartz inclusions was also measured using a heating rate of 5\u02daC s-1 (no optical filter was \ninserted in the detection system). Laboratory beta doses were administered to luminescence \nsamples using a 90Sr\/90Y beta source mounted on the reader that had been calibrated \n 13 \nagainst a secondary standard 60Co source (G\u00f6ksu et al., 1995). The beta irradiator was also \nused to administer doses to aliquots of Al2O3:C grains (in situ gamma-ray dosimetry), where \nan aluminium absorber was inserted below the irradiator aperture to provide a sufficiently low \ndose-rate (calibrated dose-rate, 224 Gy min-1), in this case primarily due to bremmstrahlung \nrather than beta particles. Alpha doses were administered to polymineral fine grain samples \nusing an irradiator containing 241Am foil sources that had been sub-calibrated against the \nOxford Research Laboratory for Archaeology alpha source (Aitken, 1985). \n \nProcedures: quartz inclusions \nSample aliquots of typically 1-2 mg of quartz were deposited as a near monolayer onto \nstainless steel discs that had previously been coated with a thin layer of silicone oil and \nspread within a diameter of 6-8 mm. Initial tests were performed to establish the basic OSL \nand TL characteristics of each sample. On the basis of relatively poorer TL signal strength \nand levels of sensitisation in some samples, the palaeodose was determined using OSL for \nall the samples discussed here.  \n \nThe absorbed dose, P, to quartz grains was determined using a single aliquot OSL \nregenerative procedure (Proc. A, Table 2) based on a procedure described previously (Bailiff \nand Holland, 2000). It is similar to the SAR procedure described by Murray and Wintle, 2000; \n2003), but handles corrections for sensitization effects and thermal transfer differently, to suit \nthe characteristics of comparatively young ceramic samples. The main steps are given in \nTable 2. A second OSL decay curve was recorded at each stage of the regenerative \nprocedure (Proc. A, steps 3, 5, 7, 11) to monitor the OSL signal due to thermal transfer, \nreferred to as a pre-heat monitor, and this was used to define the background signal. The \ndegree of sensitization was measured at two levels of dose within each sequence (Proc A, \nsteps 9 and 11) The preheat treatment, comprising a 10s hold at the selected temperature, \nTP, was applied for temperatures between 200 and 260 \u02daC to establish the form of the \npalaeodose-preheat characteristic (P vs TP). The pattern of sensitivity change with \n 14 \ncumulative dose was measured by repeating a series of regeneration cycles using the same \ndose and pre-heat temperature. The same procedure was applied to separate aliquots using \na different preheat temperature. The beta doses administered in regeneration measurements \nranged from 0.8 to 1.2 of the estimated cumulative dose (P), and this range was extended if \nfurther investigation of the growth characteristic was required. The measurements detailed in \nProcedure B (Table 1) were performed with further aliquots to provide data equivalent to the \nSAR procedure described by Murray and Wintle (2003).  \n \nAdditive dose measurements were also applied to test for changes in luminescence \nproperties during the first OSL measurement using Procedure B with one pre-heat \ntemperature (220\u02daC). The \u2018additive\u2019 beta dose was administered before Step 1 (see Table 2) \nwhere three levels of additive dose were applied ( = 0.5P, P and 1.5P) to separate sets of \naliquots.  \n \nDose-rate assessment \nThe components of the total dose-rate, D\uf026 tot, were determined by direct measurement of the \ncontemporary dose-rate in pulverised brick samples (beta radiation) and, as described \nabove, in the sampled walls (gamma and cosmic radiation) by employing luminescent \ndosemeters.  Indirect methods based on the measurement of activity using thick source \nalpha counting (TSAC) and high resolution gamma spectrometry were also used to \ndetermine the concentrations of lithogenic radionuclides in the same pulverised samples of \nbrick. Samples of mortar recovered from some of the locations during drilling were also \nanalysed. \n \nInstrumentation \nThe beta dose-rate was determined using the technique of -TLD (Bailiff, 1982; Aitken, \n1985). The system employs a 10 mm dia. calcium fluoride dosemeter to measure externally \n 15 \nthe beta dose-rate close to the surface of the sample and interposed between which is a \nmylar screen to absorb alpha particles. The gamma-ray activity of brick samples was \nmeasured using a gamma-ray spectrometer (configured with shielding for low background, \nCanberra high purity germanium coaxial detector type GR2018 of 20% efficiency and with a \nBe window). The spectrometer was calibrated using silica rich sands containing lithogenic \nradionuclides of certified concentrations (New Brunswick Laboratories, USA). The alpha \nactivity of pulverised brick samples was determined using thick source alpha counting \n(TSAC), as described in Aitken (1985), with prefabricated ZnS scintillator screens of 42 mm \ndiameter (Daybreak Nuclear Ltd, USA). The apparatus was calibrated using SiO2 sands of \ncertified U and Th concentrations (as above).  \n \nProcedures \n-TLD measurements were performed with several aliquots (~ 2 cm3) of a pulverised portion \nof the same brick slice. The combined gamma and cosmic dose-rate was measured with the \nAl2O3:C dosemeter capsules for periods ranging from 0.5 to 5 years. Following retrieval of the \ndosemeters, the accrued absorbed dose was determined by measuring the TL signal and \napplying a regeneration procedure.  \n \nThick source alpha counting (TSAC) was performed with pulverised brick samples (~ 5 g), in \nan unsealed state ( 0) and during the first 24 h following sealing ( 1). The alpha activity of HF \netched quartz was also measured using the same measurement technique but where ~10 \nmg of pulverised quartz was deposited onto a 26.5 mm dia. mylar disc by sedimentation and \nplaced into contact with a ZnS scintillator screen of the same diameter. Larger quantities (25 \ng) of the pulverised brick were measured to determine the activities of the 232Th and 238U \ndecay series and 40K using the high resolution gamma-ray spectrometer. The specific \nactivities of the 232Th and 238U decay series were determined by measurement of the gamma-\n 16 \nray emissions by 228Ac, 212Bi, 212Pb and 206Tl (232Th series), and 226Ra, 214Pb, 214Bi and 210Pb \n(238U series).   \nA measure of the saturation water uptake by the brick fabric was obtained by immersing cut \nsections of brick in water at room temperature for a period of 5-10 days. The weight of water \nabsorbed is expressed as a percentage of the weight of air-dried (50\u02daC) material. \n \nRESULTS \nBrick fabric  \nExamination of cut surfaces of brick indicated the absence of agglomerations of sand-size \ngrains in all the samples. The fabrics of samples taken from 301, 315, 317, 319, 311, were \npredominantly uniform, and generally of fine composition with little distinguishing features. \nSample 315-5 had a noticeably higher concentration of sand-size temper. The fabrics of \nsamples from 318 were coarser with some stone fragments and various sizes of crystalline \ninclusions in the temper.  All the bricks were of soft composition, but well fired, and of \ngenerally uniform red colour with no evidence of reduction or vitrification. \n \nPalaeodose \nQuartz inclusions \nWith the exception of three samples, the OSL intensities recorded were weak, and to obtain \nsignals of adequate strength the stimulation source was adjusted to 90% of maximum power \nto allow the OSL signal to be resolved. A high proportion of the OSL decayed within several \nseconds and the decay curves were dominated by components (Bailey, 2001) judged to be \n\u2018fast\u2019\/\u2018medium\u2019; the \u2018slow\u2019 component was either absent or not resolved above the \nbackground signal. The relative strength of the natural OSL signal for each sample is \nindicated by the signal-to-background ratio, RSB, the values of which are given in Table 3. \nVery bright emissions were obtained from three samples (311-6, 317-1a and 319-1), \nwhereas sample 301-1 was the weakest, approaching a level where fluctuations due to poor \n 17 \nsignal statistics intrude (RSB = ~0.5 - 1). The latter becomes noticeable at higher preheat \ntemperatures and where, for example, a 50% reduction in intensity was observed when the \npreheat temperature was increased from 220 to 260\u00b0C in the case of sample 301.  \n \nThe OSL signal was obtained by integrating the photon counts recorded during the first few \nseconds of stimulation (typically 5s), which was sufficient to account for at least 80% of the \nemission associated with the \u2018fast\u2019\/\u2018medium\u2019 components. Once selected, the same period of \nintegration was used for all measurements performed with one sample. The OSL data \ncalculated in this manner were used to generate a growth characteristic, providing there was \nno significant change in the form of the decay curve within the integration range throughout \nthe series of regeneration measurements. Where aliquots failed to meet this requirement, the \nresults were excluded. On average, about 14% of all the aliquots measured were excluded \nfrom the calculation of P due to either change in the form of the decay curve, poor \nreproducibility in the growth characteristic data or large statistical fluctuations in the signal \nafter subtraction of the background signal. \n \nThe estimate of P for each aliquot was obtained using the interpolation procedure applied in \nthe standard regenerative technique and included corrections for changes in sensitivity \nduring the repeated measurement cycles. The average degree of sensitivity change for these \nsamples is low (Table 3), but in view of the variability between aliquots of the same sample \n(e.g. in half the cases the s.d. is ~ \u00b110% or greater) corrective procedures were applied. In \nthe first, the sensitivity per unit dose was plotted against cumulative dose and, where there \nwas a consistent pattern of change, a coefficient of sensitization was calculated and applied \nas a cumulative correction factor to the measured OSL signal at each measured point in the \nprocedure. The second correction procedure followed that described by Murray and Wintle \n(2003), except that the \u2018test\u2019 dose was comparable to the size of P (as indicated in Table 2). \nThe growth characteristics plotted with the sensitivity corrected values were found to be \nlinear and with indication of negligible supralinear growth at low doses.  \n 18 \n \nTwo examples of the  palaeodose-preheat temperature characteristic are shown in Fig. 1a,b \nfor samples 311-6 and 315-5. Concordance of the values of P for a range of pre-heat \ntemperatures is generally used as a qualitative test to confirm that i) the measured OSL is \nassociated with the release of charge from traps that are thermally stable over the dating \ntimescale of interest and ii) the regenerative procedure applied is self-consistent in terms of \ncorrecting for changes in sensitivity during the experiment.  For preheat temperatures above \n200\u02daC, the OSL signal is predicted by calculation to be stable for periods beyond a million \nyears at ambient temperatures (Smith et al., 1990), and thermal stability is consequently not \nan issue for dating during the last 1000 years. The behaviour observed ranged from samples \nexhibiting a resolved plateau with small dispersion in P (Fig. 1a), to cases where the \ndispersion was relatively high (Fig. 1b), and where the definition of a plateau over an \nequivalent range of preheat temperatures is not clear-cut.  \n \nThe values of P used in the evaluation of the age equation correspond to the mean of the \nvalues obtained for a selected range of preheat temperatures (Table 3).  The standard error \nof the mean value was used as the measure of uncertainty (col. 6). In some cases, where the \nvalues of P obtained for the highest and lowest preheat temperatures agreed within the limits \nof experimental error, the average value of P was calculated using data for only one pre-heat \ntemperature selected within the range of the other preheat temperatures applied (col. 4) to \noptimize the precision in P. Using this procedure the standard error for the majority of \nsamples ranges is less than \u00b11.5% (rising to \u00b13.2%, 311-4). It is interesting to note that \nbricks taken from the same wall had differing characteristics (317-1a, \u00b11% vs 317-1b, \n\u00b12.4%).  The values of the range, P, of the P values, expressed as a standardized value, \nobtained for each sample (Table 3, col. 5), were less than 4 and this is consistent with \nexpectation for normally distributed values of P. \n \n 19 \nThe results of the additive dose measurements were used to construct a characteristic \nsimilar to that developed for use in the pre-dose technique (Haskell and Bailiff, 1985) and \nalso later adapted in the OSL SARA procedure (Mejdahl and B\u00f8tter-Jensen, 1994). The \nestimate of the palaeodose, PAdd, was obtained by extrapolating a linear curve fitted to a plot \nof the total dose determined using a regenerative procedure vs. additional laboratory dose.  \nA comparison of the values of palaeodose obtained using the additive (PAdd) and the \nstandard regenerative procedure (denoted PRegen) plotted in Fig. 2 indicate agreement within \nexperimental uncertainty (slope = 1.06\u00b10.06; s.d., n=10). The two procedures are expected \nto give the same value of palaeodose unless a change in the luminescence sensitivity occurs \nduring the first OSL measurement, which would not be detected using the standard \nregenerative procedure. The need to extrapolate the characteristic obtained using additive \ndoses gives rise to inferior precision in the palaeodose and hence it has not been used in the \nage calculation.  \n \nAmongst several potential causes of elevated levels of dispersion in measured values of P is \nspatial heterogeneity in dose-rate, in particular the beta dose-rate. Elevated and significantly \nvarying concentrations of uranium and\/or thorium within quartz grains may also lead to \ndifferences in the internal grain alpha dose-rate, but the alpha counting screening tests \napplied to the samples discussed here suggest low internal activity from these sources. In \naddition to poor mixing of coarse aggregates of significantly differing radionuclide content \n(e.g. flint and sandstone) of the type considered by Nathan et al. (2003) in sedimentary \nmedia for example, or the presence of grains with concentrations of beta emitting \nradionuclides that are significantly higher than in the ceramic matrix (e.g. potassic feldspars), \nagglomerations of quartz grains (Kaipa et al., 1988) may occur in bricks. Agglomerations that \nbreak up during sample preparation can lead to a significant variation in the beta dose-rate \n(e.g. by 50%) to individual grains.  Sensitivity to this type of heterogeneity is likely to be \nincreased if the luminescence measured is dominated by a few ultra bright quartz grains \nwithin each aliquot. Tests using an OSL scanner (Bailiff and Mikhailik, 2003; Fig. 3) with \n 20 \naliquots of some of the samples in this study indicated that the luminescence detected was \ndominated by a small proportion of bright grains \u2013 similar to that widely observed in unheated \nsingle grain measurements with quartz extracted from sedimentary samples. Although visual \ninspection of cut surfaces of brick indicated the absence of agglomerations, which is \nsupported by finding generally low dispersion in the values of P, some samples (e.g., 317-1b \nand 315-5) exhibited higher levels of dispersion in P (Fig. 1a,b). A proportionately wide range \nof values of RSB due to poor signal statistics obtained with some aliquots probably accounts \nfor the higher dispersion in P for sample 317-1b, and it is interesting to note that a sample \ntaken from the same wall (317-1a) and separated by a couple of meters has markedly \ndifferent characteristics. In the case of 315-5, the reproducibility of the signals (RSB = 2.3\u00b10.1) \nsuggests that the dispersion in P is associated with heterogeneity in the beta dose-rate \nrather than with poor signal statistics. Pinpointing the source of variation requires more \ndetailed work to establish the nature of the spatial relationship between quartz grains (as \nradiation dosemeters), other constituents in the fabric (absorbers, such as agglomerations) \nand the radionuclide sources. Recent work on the spatially resolved determination of \nabsorbed dose in quartz grains in slices of brick has indicated that visually complex fabrics \nare not necessarily associated with significant dispersion in P (Bailiff, 2006).   \n \nPolymineral fine grain \nThe palaeodose was determined using an OSL additive dose, single aliquot regenerative, \nprocedure. Tests of the stability of the signal after a 4-month storage period at ambient \ntemperatures indicated loss of signal due to anomalous fading in all cases (10-40%). In view \nof this outcome further technical details of these measurements are not presented. \n \nDose-rate \nThe total dose-rate, D\uf026 tot, was determined primarily from the results of - and - TLD \nrespectively. Data obtained using thick source alpha counting and high resolution gamma-ray \n 21 \nspectrometry provided further detail of the contributions made to the dose-rate by different \nradionuclides and the extent of disequilibrium. The thick source alpha activity results were \nalso applied in the calculation of the effective alpha dose-rate for the subset of samples that \nwere tested using the fine-grain technique.  \n \nThe values of D\uf026 tot, used in the calculation of the luminescence age, are given for each \nsample in Table 4, together with a breakdown of the percentage contribution due to beta and \ncombined gamma and cosmic radiation dose-rates. The majority of D\uf026 tot is due to beta \nradiation (average, 64%) and hence is associated with sources located within the brick. \nMeasurements of the alpha activity of pulverised HF etched quartz performed where there \nwas sufficient material (one sample from each building) indicated a count-rate approaching \nthe background rate and corresponding to an effective internal alpha dose-rate of about 0.03 \nmGy a-1 assuming an efficiency of 5%. An allowance of 0.03\u00b10.02 mGy a-1 to account for the \ninternal grain dose-rate is included in the total dose-rate for all the samples.  The screening \nof quartz for uranium and\/or thorium indicated negligible internal radioactivity for the samples \ndiscussed here (samples of etched quartz are submitted for analysis using mass \nspectrometry if elevated activity is detected).  \n \nThe specific activities of 238U, 232Th and 40K and the value of the 210Pb:226Ra ratio, obtained by \ngamma spectrometry, are given in Table 4 (cols 4-7). These activities were converted to \npoint absorber beta dose-rates (col. 9) using conversion factors taken from Adamiec and \nAitken (1998) for the Th and U series and Nambi and Aitken (1986) for 40K, and taking into \naccount suggested revisions to the contribution from 87Rb (Readhead, 2002a,b).  \nThe measured 210Pb: 226Ra activity ratios (col. 7) indicate a partial loss of gaseous 222Rn from \nall the bricks (in situ), leading to a lower dose-rate from the uranium series than would be \nobtained if the radon had been fully retained. (Aitken, 1985; Olley et al., 1996). On the basis \nof the energy released by the 238U decay series (Adameic and Aitken, 1998), full loss of 222Rn \n 22 \nwithin the sample volume of interest is expected to lead to reductions of 60% and 96% in the \nbeta and gamma dose rates respectively due to natural uranium. In the case of sample 318-\n2, for example, this would lead to a reduction in beta and gamma dose-rates due to all the \nlithogenic sources of 9% and 29% respectively and, for the observed 30% deficit in 222Rn, \n~3% and ~9% respectively (210Pb: 226Ra activity ratio = 0.7; Table 4). Hence dose-rates \ncalculated on the basis of the concentrations of the lithogenic radionuclides assuming \nsecular equilibrium in the U and Th series are expected to be systematically higher than the \nexperimentally determined dose rates (  TLD and  TLD). The average value of the ratio of \nthe infinite medium beta dose-rate calculated using concentration values and measured by  \nTLD (Table 4, col. 9) for the samples tested is 1.00\u00b10.07 (s.d., n=12), with a range of 0.91-\n1.03.  Although this level of precision is not sufficient to test for the expected differences \ndiscussed above, the data indicate overall consistency between the two methods.  \nA similar comparison of gamma and cosmic dose-rate at the dosemeter location is more \ncomplex because adjustments for the irradiation geometry are required. The combined \ngamma and cosmic dose-rate at each dosemeter location was calculated on the basis of the \nmeasured radionuclide concentrations (Table 4 and notes) and using data published by \nPrescott and Hutton (1988). The average value for the equivalent ratios of the combined \ngamma and cosmic dose-rate at the dosemeter locations (Table 4, col. 8) is 1.06\u00b10.13 (s.d., \nn = 11) and, within the limitations of the comparison, this is consistent with the expected \ndifference discussed above. A more precise comparison requires, in addition to the \nconsiderations of radon release from the bricks in situ, knowledge of the radionuclide \nconcentrations within the other bricks surrounding the sample location that contribute to the \ngamma dose-rate, the composition and uniformity of which are presumed to be similar in the \nabove calculations.  \n \nMoisture content  \n 23 \nThe moisture contents of the bricks when sampled were less than 2%; except at location 318 \nwhere they were higher (3-4%). The values assigned for the average moisture content since \nconstruction were 3\u00b11% (all locations except 318) and 5\u00b11% (318), and corrections to the \ndose-rate for differences between the absorption coefficients of water and ceramic were \nmade using the factors (Table 4, notes) derived by Zimmerman (1971) and given in Aitken \n(1985). The measured values of saturation water uptake are also given in Table 4 (col. 10). \nThese moisture content values were used to: i) adjust the beta dose-rate (Aitken, 1985), ii) \ncalculate the uncertainty in both beta and gamma dose-rate due to fluctuations in moisture \ncontent and iii) adjust the gamma dose-rate where it was calculated using radionuclide \nconcentration data and combined with the published conversion factors discussed above to \ncompare with the dose-rate measured by the dosemeters.  \n \nAge calculation \nThe dose-rate, D\uf026 tot, in the age equation represents a time-averaged value that is derived \nfrom contemporary measurements. Various assumptions and estimations concerning the \nuncertainty in the dose-rate associated with this extrapolation to the date of construction of \nthe sampled part of the structure are made when calculating the age. It is assumed that the \nbricks were used shortly after manufacture and that the structure from which they were taken \nremained intact \u2013 i.e., that the bricks were not re-used from an earlier building.  A relatively \nrestricted range of the average moisture content is specified for the sampled locations (3\u00b11% \nexcept 318, 5\u00b11%), and these margins make a small contribution (<3% of the overall error) to \nthe overall uncertainty in the age. This seems to be reasonable in the light of recent studies \n(Raimondo et al., 2006) of the effect of microstructure and pore morphology on the \nequilibrium moisture content (MEq; absorbed water per dry volume) of modern fired clay \nbricks, where a value of MEq converted to absorbed water per unit dry weight of ~3% was \nobtained for bricks with a total porosity of ~35% (70% RH). \n 24 \nNonetheless, since larger variations in average moisture content have a potentially strong \neffect on the value of the dose-rate, it is important to be aware of the sensitivity in the age \ncalculation.  The calculated effect of changes in the average moisture content on the age for \na given value of palaeodose is illustrated in Fig. 4, using data for sample 318-2.  As the \naverage moisture content rises, the age increases due to the reduction in dose-rate, and the \nwidth of the age distribution is related to the uncertainty specified in the moisture content.  In \nmoving from a dry condition to 10% moisture content (saturation level for 318-2), the \nrelationship is linear and the age increases from 530\u00b132 to 574\u00b137 years, corresponding to \napproximately 5 years increase in age per % increment in average moisture content. The \nmoisture content values are assumed to be normally distributed about the mean value in \nthese calculations, but for larger variations other distributions, such as log-normal, may be \nmore appropriate. Significant departures from steady-state conditions in the past would \nconsequently have potentially important implications on the interpretation of dates and hence \nthis needs to be considered when selecting samples. A more quantitative approach to \narriving at an estimate of the average moisture content is likely to require an analysis of the \npore size distribution (Raimondo et al., 2006) and this type of investigation has yet to be \nexplored. \n \nThe luminescence properties of the quartz extracted from the additional samples obtained \nfrom Ayscoughfee Hall (319) and Boston Guildhall (310), were not favourable for dating \nmeasurements (due to weak luminescence signals) and this reflects the variability of \nproperties that can occur between bricks of similar age and manufacture taken from the \nsame building.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nConsistently good agreement between the luminescence and assigned date ranges was \nobtained within the time span investigated of about 350 years (Fig. 5; Table 5). For the dating \n\u2018control\u2019 locations of Boston Guildhall (310), Doddington Hall (317), Tattershall (318) and \n 25 \nAyscoughfee (319) the mean difference, d, between the central values of luminescence and \nassigned ages is 5\u00b110 years, (s.d., n= 6), taking each result to provide an independent test \nof comparison. Calculation of the 2 statistic for the differences indicates agreement between \nthe assigned and luminescence dates at a significance level of 0.05 ( 2 = 6.2 d.f.  The \nlarger difference observed in the case of Alford Manor is discussed further below. The \nvariation in d for this group was also calculated by means of a simple Monte Carlo \nsimulation that assumed normal and uniform distributions associated with the luminescence \nand assigned dates respectively; it produced a distribution that is approximately normal, with \na central value of +5 years and with a standard deviation of \u00b110 years. Using either \napproach, the average difference compares favourably with the value of the error term B \nassociated with the luminescence dates (\u00b117 to \u00b137 years) calculated using the standard \nuncertainty assessment procedure. \n \nThe luminescence dates for the pairs of samples taken from the same phase of the same \nbuilding (Doddington, 317; Tattershall, 318) overlap within the A uncertainty limits, indicating \nself-consistency of the dating results for each of these buildings. However, in the case of \nAlford (301) and Ayscoughfee (319), one of the two core samples taken could not be dated \nbecause the luminescence signals from quartz inclusions were too weak. Unfortunately it has \nnot been possible so far to identify \u2018good\u2019 luminescence samples from an inspection of the \nexternal brick surface. \n \nThe central value of the Alford Manor luminescence date, although some 55 years earlier \nthan the assigned date (Clark and Nash, 2003), lies just within 2 B limits ( d = 1.9 B) of the \nassigned date range of 1611-1615. However, it is now understood (J. Clark, pers. comm.) \nthat the sampled brick was located in an area of brickwork at a corner of the building that had \nbeen inserted during the early C18th following removal of the original timber corner post. The \naltered nature of the brickwork had not been realised at the time of sampling, which \n 26 \npreceded the structural analysis by at least a year. This raises both technical luminescence \nand building historical issues. If it is assumed that the brick was re-used, the dose-rate \nhistory of the brick before the C18th alteration is uncertain. The main component of the dose-\nrate that is uncertain is the gamma and cosmic ray dose-rate (30-40% of the total dose-rate) \nduring the period beyond ~300 years in age. Providing the brick was amongst other bricks (in \na wall or within a discarded pile), the average combined gamma and cosmic dose-rate for the \nsampled brick during the period in question is likely to be within 20% of the currently \nassessed average dose-rate. If the average gamma and cosmic dose-rate is changed from \n110 to 90% of the value given in Table 4 to account for this, the central value of the date \nchanges from 1530 to 1570; in other words, making only a slight change to that given in \nTable 5.  It is possible that the brick sampled was a re-used Alford Manor brick (ca 1611), but \na 50% increase in the average combined gamma and cosmic dose-rate would be required to \nyield a date that is consistent with the assigned date range, and this is considered \nimprobable. The dating evidence points more towards the use of brick from another structure \nof age similar to or greater than that of Alford Manor.  It may be relevant that the highest ratio \nof calculated to measured gamma dosemeter dose-rate (Table 4) is for Alford, indicating \ndifferences in the composition of the bricks within the repaired section.  Although the more \npressing issue for the application of luminescence to this particular building is the testing of \nbrickwork firmly associated with the 1611 construction, the detection of the practice of re-use \nof brick from other structures of differing age presents a potentially interesting area of \ninvestigation.  \n \nThe luminescence date of 1730 \u00b111; \u00b118 (315-5) for the later phase sample from Clarendon \nHouse falls within the assigned range of 1717-1737, although the overall uncertainty is not \nsufficient to resolve the issue of interpretation of the datestone. However, the luminescence \ndate of 1688 \u00b18; \u00b118 (315-4) for the sample taken from the interior wall confirms that it is \nassociated with an earlier phase of the building since the difference of 42 years between the \ncentral values of the two ages is shown to be significant using Ward and Wilson\u2019s (1978) test \n 27 \nstatistic T (T=9.5; \u03c721,0.05 = 3.84), where A was used as the weighting factor in calculating the \npooled date.  \n \nThe current resolving power of the method applied in this study is more severely tested in the \ncase of the three Fydell House samples 311-2, -4 and -6 (1727\u00b18;\u00b117, 1709\u00b112\u00b120, \n1721\u00b110\u00b117 respectively). The pooled age for these samples is 1719 \u00b16; \u00b112 and the value \nof the T statistic, applied as discussed above, is 1.6 which indicates that the dates are not \nsignificantly different (\u03c722,0.05 = 5.99) as a group. Hence the range of the pooled date (1707-\n1731) accommodates both of the assigned date ranges for the construction and suggested \nalterations. \n \nAn examination of the calculations for all the dates discussed above indicates that the major \ncontributor to the error term B is the systematic error associated with the calibration of the \nlaboratory radiation sources and the various coefficients related to dose-rate assessment, \nequivalent to the uncertainties 4 and 5 in Aitken (1985). Following Aitken, a margin of \u00b15% \nassociated with calibration factors and the various coefficients has been retained in these \ncalculations, although the indication from the above control group comparison is that a lower \nvalue may be appropriate. However, given the potential for variation in the various \nparameters to exceed this margin, particularly in respect of the dose-rate, it would be prudent \nto retain the \u00b15% margin until a major methodological reassessment of calibrations and \nuncertainty assessment is completed. \n \nThe average of the error terms A and B for the samples tested correspond to about \u00b13% \nand \u00b16% of their luminescence ages respectively. At this level of calculated uncertainty ( B; \ncorresponding to 1  ranges of ~35 to ~80 years for the period 1700-1300 respectively), \napplication of the method to the dating of late medieval brick buildings is potentially \nappropriate where conventional analysis or tree-ring dating has been unable to provide \n 28 \nabsolute chronological placement to better than about 50 years. Also, the provision of \nabsolute dates for studying the re-use of brick, may offer a new direction of investigation. \nAlthough this was unwittingly detected at Alford, it has been more systematically investigated \nin a study of a group of buildings in Newcastle upon Tyne (Bailiff et al., in preparation).  The \nlevel of precision ( A) that is routinely achievable with English brick requires further testing by \napplying the method more widely and, in particular, to the analysis of multiple phase \nbuildings. When producing and comparing a series of dates from the same building, for \nwhich the error term A can be used, it is likely that the application of Bayesian analysis (e.g., \nMillard, 2006) to a sequence of dates would enhance the resolving power of the method. \nAlso, since different bricks of the same manufacture may have widely differing luminescence \nresponses and may not yield measurable signals in some cases, the sampling of several \nbricks is advisable even if the surviving structure is believed to be original and of one phase. \nThe opportunities for multiple sampling of this type, while usually limited in fully restored \nbuildings, are likely to be significantly improved in terms of access and the structural detail \nrevealed where buildings are undergoing restoration, or subject to formal recording required \nby legislated planning guidance. \n \nThe detection of anomalous fading in the fine grain samples tested in this study indicates that \nthe long term stability tests should form part of initial tests if the fine grain method is to be \nused. However, the occurrence of this characteristic is likely to vary according to clay source \nand, for example, in one case of a brick sampled from a building in North East England \nwhere anomalous fading was absent in the fine grain sample, good agreement between fine \ngrain and quartz inclusion dates was obtained. The fine grain method has the advantage of \nrequiring less sample, offering greater flexibility where cosmetic damage to walls is an issue, \nand a lower dependence of the total dose-rate on sources external to the brick, which is \ndesirable where there are doubts concerning the integrity of the brickwork or structural \nchanges in the local environment. On the other hand, the introduction of a third component of \n 29 \ndosimetry (alpha) increases the overall error due to the addition of a further set of \nexperimental uncertainties.  \n \nAs with the determination of the palaeodose, the reliability of the assessment of dose-rate \ncan be expected to be improved by using two independent methods of measurement, and \nderivation of the total dose rate by both experimental dosimetry and by calculation based on \nmeasured radionuclide concentrations are desirable. The long term radon emanation from \nundisturbed brick fabric indicated by the gamma spectrometry measurements affects both \nsystems of measurement but requires adjusted conversion factors to be applied to the \nconcentration values to obtain the current dose-rate. The assumption that the latter is \nrepresentative of the lifetime average for the sampled structure is susceptible to unknown \nvariations in radon emanation and moisture content in the past (and noting the former is \nrelated to the latter; Aitken, 1985), and this affects both methods of measurement. The \nconcordance of the luminescence and assigned dates indicate that the assumptions made \nconcerning this extrapolation are reasonable for this study. Similar agreement elsewhere, is \nlikely to be influenced by the possibility of the selecting sample locations that are currently \ndry and where there have not been prolonged episodes of elevated moisture levels in the \npast. Amongst the various coefficients and factors that are applied in the calculation of the \ndose-rate using both methods, three in particular need further refinement to reduce the \nexperimental uncertainties in general application: i) the wall geometry factor which is \ncurrently limited to a plane wall geometry, ii) the reduction in the average dose-rate due \nradon release and iii) the dosemeter wall attenuation factor (Aznar et al, 2003), given that the \ndesign of encapsulation varies between laboratories. \n \nOne further point is that by testing material towards the rear of the sampled brick ( ~10 cm \nfrom the surface for these samples), the effect of contributions to the palaeodose from \nradionuclide sources located beyond the immediate vicinity of the sampled core such as \nadjacent walls and layers in the form of plaster that may have been added at a later stage \n 30 \nduring the history of the building are reduced due to shielding by the material closer to the \nexternal surface. \nCONCLUSION \nThe results of this study indicate that the OSL technique applied to quartz extracted from \nbrick is capable of producing dates that are in good agreement with independent dating \nevidence. For six samples taken from a group of four \u2018control\u2019 buildings the mean difference \nbetween the central values of luminescence and assigned ages was 5\u00b110 years (s.d., n= 6). \nThis was tested with a group of high status buildings in Lincolnshire as a precursor to a wider \nstudy of vernacular English buildings, but the methodology used is appropriate for application \nto other standing buildings in other temporal and geographic regions, and might be used with \nconfidence where conventional dating methods are less certain. The study also examined \nthe luminescence characteristics of quartz and the characteristics of the lithogenic \nradionuclides in brick samples and identified various aspects related to the assessment of \nexperimental uncertainty that will be examined in wider testing of the method. \n \nAlthough the potential of applying TL in architectural historical studies was demonstrated \nover two decades ago by the Berlin group in their study on northern Italian villas, this work \nprovides the basis for applying the method to English buildings, particularly of the late \nmedieval period, where hitherto the method has not been exploited. The dating of brick from \nearlier medieval English buildings is also a long standing research question awaiting further \nstudy. Although luminescence cannot provide the degree of chronological resolution \ncomparable to the best provided by conventional buildings analysis combined with tree-ring \nanalysis, there are many instances where the dating of brickwork in vernacular buildings is \nuncertain due to a lack of diagnostic features or suitable timber structural elements for tree-\nring analysis. Moreover, by providing a direct means of dating of bricks as artefacts, \nluminescence has a role that is complementary to conventional buildings analysis. It also \nopens up the possibility of contributing to the study of the re-use of brick in structures, and \nmore generally how this may relate to lost buildings in the archaeological record.  \n 31 \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nI am grateful to the following owners and custodians of the buildings included in this study for \ngranting permission to obtain samples and access to information concerning the construction \nof the buildings: The National Trust (Tattershall Castle), S.

The value of \u00df in the \nsubsequent steps (3, 5, 7, etc.) was adjusted to reflect the combined dose (P+ \u00df\u2019) received before \nthe first OSL measurement. \n 40 \nTable 3.

The dose-rates given in the first two cols. are the experimentally determined values to which \ncorrections for moisture content ( dose rate) and attenuation (  and dose rates) have been \napplied, as discussed in the main text. Details of the attenuation factors incorporated in the lumped \ncorrection factors b and g in Eqn. 1 are given below; the alpha dose contribution is assumed to be \nnegligible for these samples. \n \n2. The values of the point absorber beta dose-rate within the tested material, as measured using -\nTLD, were reduced (by 7% for 90-150 m grains) to account for the effects of attenuation due to \nthe finite size of the quartz grains using data published by Brennan (2003).  \n \n3.  The gamma dose-rates, as measured by -TLD, were increased by 8% (after making an allowance \nfor the estimated cosmic dose contribution) to account for the attenuation of gamma radiation by \n 42 \nthe dosemeter capsule wall.  This value was derived from Monte Carlo simulations for a dosemeter \nlocated within a brick wall. Where the dosemeter was located within 1 cm of the depth of the core \nsection tested, no further adjustment to the measured dose-rate was performed. Otherwise, a \ncorrection (< 5%) was made to the dose-rate to adjust for the rise in the gamma dose-rate with \ndepth using dose-rate profiles (Bailiff, 2001) that employ coefficients calculated by L\u00f8vborg and \npresented in Aitken (1985, Appdx. H).  \n3.  The combined gamma and cosmic dose-rate at the dosemeter location was calculated using the \nconcentrations of the lithogenic radionuclides measured in brick by gamma spectrometry, using a \ngeneral value for mortar (U\/Th\/K: 30\/30\/300 Bq kg\n-1\n).  The calculations took into account the \nrelative masses of brick and mortar within the wall structure, estimated on the basis of the average \ndimensions of brick and mortar thickness. The infinite medium gamma dose-rate was calculated \nfrom concentration values using published conversion factors, as discussed in the main text, and \nthe dose-rate at the dosemeter position was obtained by application of a wall geometry factor, the \nvalue of which is related to dosemeter depth and wall thickness (e.g. 0.85 for at 10 cm depth in a \n50 cm thick wall). The estimated values of the cosmic dose-rate were in the range 0.15 \u2013 0.2 mGy \na\n-1\n, where the upper limit was used for external samples and samples in roof spaces. For buildings \nwhere the roof material had been changed from thatch to mineral tile, it was assumed that the \naverage cosmic dose-rates at a depth of 10 cm in brick were likely to be similar (typical reed thatch \nthickness is 35 kg m\n-2\n). \n4. Corrections to dose-rates for moisture content were made using factors (ratio of absorption \ncoefficients for water and ceramic) of 1.25 and 1.14 for the beta and gamma dose-rates \nrespectively, as calculated by Zimmerman (1971).   \n \n 43 \nTable 5.
