The miierits of imlplemenlting both a full- and reduced\norder observer, is inivestigated, witlh the latter being implelmlenlted with a nlew low-cost, high-bandwidth\ntorque sensing device based on suiface acoustic wave techniology.\nIntroduction\nRcjecvion of periodic load disturbances by foed-forward is a classical control problten when thc\ntorsional system interconnecting the motor and load can be considered infinitely stiff, and\/or tlhe\ndynamic load pertubations can be measured or estimated to a sufficiently high bandwidth [1]. In the\nmajority of cases, load torque cannot be directly measured, and therefore, controllers usually require\nan observer (termed disturbance observer) to provide a dynanic estimate of the unknown input.\nUnforftmatcly, sincc fcod-forward comnpdnsation is appliod directly into thc scrvo-ainplifior, its\neffectiveness is heavily reliant on the ability of the observer to provide a high bandwidth, delay free,\ntoad torque signal, since any phase delay will significantly imnpede the ability of the controller to\ncompensate effectively. However, observer algorithms are fundanentally derivative in nature (i.e. they\namplify high frequency sensor noise), and those generally intended for industrial motion control\napplications (where usually the sole feedback sensor is the quanltised position signal from an encoder)\nare therefore required to exlhibit relatively low bandwidths, usually <100Hz [2], in order to atteniuate\nhigh frequency noise and comlpensate for additional measuremenlt delays [3]. Moreover, in such\napplications, the dynamics imparted by relatively low bandwidtlh observers unduly influences the\nsystem dynamics, utltinately affecting the desired rejection peifonnalce [2,3]. Nevertheless, for dile\nsake of simplifying the theoretical analysis, state observer dynamics are assumed to be of a sufficiently\nhigh bandwidth that they can be ignored [1,4]. Few atgorithims exist that compensate for the\nlimitations imparted by a relatively low bandwidth observer, particularly in high perfomnance mnotion\ncontrol applications.\nFurthermore, until recently, difficulties in acquiring reliable, low-noise, tow-cost, shaft torque\ntranisducers that are non-inivasive to the miiechanical drive systemn, have precluded the use of direct\nshaft torque feedback for disturbance rejection in all but a minority of specialised closed-loop servo-\ndrive systems. Often, cominonly employed torque tmnsducers viz. strain gauge, optical and inductive\nLIt 2005 - L)rc.dcn 1SBt. P.1\nSCROFID Nigc1-\nE1.E Own5 Drede11 ISBSN: 1)-75815-08-5 I,. I\ndevices, are too mechanically compliant when incorporated in a drive systemn, thereby degrading\nstability margins and reducing closed-loop bandwidth. Moreover, the additional cost associated with\ntheir integration is prohibitive. Here ten, an investigation into itnproved tuning methodologies for\nclassical disturbance observers, is investigated, with appraisal of a new, low-cost, non-contact torque\nmeasuirement device, based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology [5]. SAW devices are\nmechanically robust, exhibit high sensitivity and bandwidth, and are largely unaffected by\nelectromagnetic noise. They can be directly integrated into an electrical miiachine assembly without\nsignificantlty affecting the mechanical stiffliess of tlle miiotor shaft. For the study, SAW devices and RF\ninodule are miiounited inside a coininercial off-the-shelf peirmanent magnet synchronious machine\n(PMSM), directly onto the motor shaft between the front bearing and the rotor magnets, as illustrated\nin Fig 1.\nFront bearing-\nSAW dev ces \/\n(a) illust-ation of servo-mwhine showing (b) Prototype ser-vo-inachine\nlocation ofSAW devices and RF module\nFigure 1.

For example, scttingK , Kdg and K; to zero will formn a PI\ncontroller plus shaft torque foedback. This is commnonly refcrrcd to as resonance ratio control (RRC)\n[6]. Similarly, setting K, KIQf and Ks to zero will formn a classical PI plus derivative (PID) controller\n[7] (i.e. impleinented when a torque transducer is available). Moreover, both the RRC and PID\ncontroller structures can be additionally imnplemented with disturbance feedback, by setting the\ndisturbance gains Ki., id,, to a non-zero value.\nOb,u Bad Ta...uk\u00b6JTS.g d SAWTmuquThSwu.kTkT wcwte S.D, Sy SCHOHELD Nijld\nNOd\n(a) Classical PI controller.\n(O,\n(b)Extended PI Controller augmented with feedback of additional state variables.\nFigure 2.

For such systems,\ndisturbance torque (as opposed to shaft or electromagnetic torque) cannot be sensed directly, and this\nrcquircs an obscrvcr to providc a dynamic cstimatc. Assuming thc disturbanec torquc is a statc-\nvariable, and is slow varying, implying that td 0, a state-variable representation of the two-inertiadt\nsystem can be obtained that includes the disturbance torque as a state, as follows:\nd tml\ndi co,1, i\nI I\n0 0 Kd\no o 0 0 I.

Notably, the order of thc obscever is reduced by thc numnber of measured states. Hence, the PID\ncontroller requires a 3rd order observer, and the RRC controller only requires a 2 d order observer.

If tie observer bandwidth (and therefore the observer poles) is (are) assigned to\nbc much grcatcr than thc highest frcqucncy component of disturbance torque, it can bc assumed that\nthe observer does not unduly influence the assigned closed-loop regulation dynamics. Unfortunately,\nin practice, the observer structure is inherently derivative in nature and therefore sensitive to noisy\nimput signals such as the motor speed signal that is obtamied from the first derivative of quantised\nencoder position. As a rcsult, therefore, the observer bandwidth must be minimised, since there exists\na trade-off between the bandwidth of the observer and filtering of high frequency noise. Unfortunately,\nif consideration is not given to the additional dynamics imparted by a relatively low bandwidth\ndisturbanco obscrvcr, thc closcd-loop pcrformancc dctcrioratcs as thc obscrvcr bandwidth is rcduccd\n[9].

For the PID\ncontroller (6), it can be seen that tdle numerator is 55' order (excluding tdle s\/kd multiplier term) which is\ncomprised of a real zero and two pairs of complex zeros that can be assigned by the selection of the\nobscrvcr bandwidth, %ob and thc disturbance feedback gains Kp and Krd. Similarly, for thc RRC\ncontroller (7), the numerator is 45' order which is comprised of two pairs of complex zeros that can be\nassigncd. Thus, in both cascs, by propcr adju stment of thcsc gains, a pair of complex conjugatc zeros\narc assigned to thc imaginary axis (no damping) for a user-dcfined froqucncy, aj , thercby rejecting\nperiodic load-side disturbances of that frequency, whilst eliminating the effects of the observer\ndynamnics on the rejection performance, i.e. a relatively low bandwidth disturbance observer can be\nimplemented, attenuating high frequency noise, without sacrificing the control objective. However, to\nimpart adequate closed-loop damping whilst additionally rejecting periodic load disturbances (a\ncomunon industrial requirement), it is desirable to have the ability to independently assign both the\nclosed-loop poles and zeros simultaneously. The closed-loop poles, when disturbance feedback is not\niilplemented (denoted the first braclcet 4h order polynomiiial expression in the denominator of (6) and\n(7)) are independently assigned according to the coefficients of thc optimal 4i- order ITAE polynomial\n[8], by the controller gains in Table I [9,10]. Moreover, it has been shown that the basic PI controller\nand two-inertia model imparts optimum closed-loop damping performance when Rzl (according to\nthe optimal ITAE polynomial) and increasingly under damped responses for R<l [7,9,10].

Regulation perfonnance ofproposed controller structures and tuning methodology\nHowever, it can be seen that, in general, the RRC controller improves low frequency attenuation for a\ngivcn obscrvcr bandwidth, whcn comparcd to that of thc PID controllcr. It should bc notcd that for\nboth controllcrs, thc obscrvcr bandwidth cannot bc madc infinitcly small, sinec, for low bandwidth\nobservers, low frequency disturbances are amplified when compared to case with no disturbance\nfeedback (i.e. when Kmd, Kdd = 0), as evidenced in Fig 4. It is therefore desirable to employ an observer\nof sufficient relative bandwidth to ensure adequate rejection of the low frequency band, particularly in\nthe event of a variation in the disturbance frequency.\nExperimental Validation\nThe proposed control techniques, simulation results and observations are now validated on the\nexperinental test-facility, comprismig of the 2.2kW prototype PMSM with integrated 2ONmn SAW-\nbased torque transducer, Fig. 1(b), and a similarly rated loading machine (representing the motor and\nload inertias, J, and J,, rcspectively). The machines are couplcd back-to-back via a shaft and\ncouplings.

For all results, shaft torque measurements are obtained from the integrated torque transducer.\nFigure 5 shows the timc domain regulation performance imparted by thc PID controller with no\ndisturbance feedback.

PI) controller with observed disturbance torque feedback.\nMoreovet to realise disturbance feedback, the PID controtler requires a full, third-order disturbance\nobserver, since only motor position fecdback is einployed, whereas the RRC controller, which\ncmploys both shaft torquo and motor position sensors, can be implotinontcd with a sceond-ordor\nobserver. Appraisal has been given to the combined observer and controller dynanics, with the zeros\nreassigned, demonstrating, for the fnrst time, that the bandwidth of the observer need not effect the\nrejection of a periodic disturbance, thereby enabling significantly lower bandwidth observers to be\nemployed, i.e. the observer bandwidth can be lower than the rejection frequency. It is shown that\nhigher bandwidth disturbance observer are required to inaximiise the disturbance attenuation over att\nof the low frequenicy band (as well as the desired rejection frequenicy), thereby attenuating a wide\nralge of possible frequencies. hi such cases, tlherefore, it is slhown that the RRC conltroller is the\n12K 2005 - Pn.Jcii P.9\nSCElOFtL 1D INigc,1\nDEl 2005 L)i--;c11i ISBN :9BU78tf8-5; 1'.9\nObsever Based Ttuning TIcul;iquts and Inttegratd SAW TorqueITrcT ue;tirs forTxs-linreia Sarvo-Drive Systms\npreferred solution by virtue of reduced noise sensitivity.

Additionally, since the SAW devices are inherently low\ncost in mass prodtuction, and the mechanical modifications to the commnercial PMSM, are miinimal, the\ncost of high voltune integration is estimated to increase the total mnachine cost by only a few percent.\n7Z r_\n\"J Od~~~~tr~\nTime [50ms\/div]\n(a) Osb 3 crj\nIA\nvsr-\nit\nTilne [50ms\/div]\n(b) ob 2Wci\nFigure 7.
