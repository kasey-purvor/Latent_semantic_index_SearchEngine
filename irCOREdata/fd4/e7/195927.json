Doi: 10.1124\/mol.109.059170Metadata only entryAgonist stimulation of the type 5 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu5) receptor initiates robust oscillatory changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single cells by rapid, repeated cycles of phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation of the mGlu5 receptor, involving protein kinase C and as-yet-unspecified protein phosphatase activities. An emergent property of this type of Ca2+ oscillation-generating mechanism (termed \u201cdynamic uncoupling\u201d) is that once a threshold concentration has been reached to initiate the Ca2+ oscillation, its frequency is largely insensitive to further increases in orthosteric agonist concentration. Here, we report the effects of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) on the patterns of single-cell Ca2+ signaling in recombinant and native mGlu5 receptor-expressing systems. In a Chinese hamster ovary cell-line (CHO-lac-mGlu5a), none of the mGlu5 receptor PAMs studied [3,3\u2032-difluorobenzaldazine (DFB), N-{4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl) methyl]phenyl}-2-hydroxy-benzamide (CPPHA), 3-cyano-N-(1, 3-diphenyl-1H-prazol-5-yl)benzamide (CDPPB), S-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-{3-[3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-[1,2,4]oxadiazol-5-yl]-piperidinl-1-yl}-methanone (ADX47273)], stimulated a Ca2+ response when applied alone, but each PAM concentration-dependently increased the frequency, without affecting the amplitude, of Ca2+ oscillations induced by glutamate or quisqualate. Therefore, PAMs can cause graded increases (and negative allosteric modulator-graded decreases) in the Ca2+ oscillation frequency stimulated by orthosteric agonist. Initial data in rat cerebrocortical astrocytes demonstrated that similar effects of PAMs could be observed in a native cell background, although at high orthosteric agonist concentrations, PAM addition could much more often be seen to drive rapid Ca2+ oscillations into peak-plateau responses. These data demonstrate that allosteric modulators can \u201ctune\u201d the Ca2+ oscillation frequency initiated by mGlu5 receptor activation, and this might allow pharmacological modification of the downstream processes (e.g., transcriptional regulation) that is unachievable through orthosteric ligand interactions","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET)","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/8057<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2010-12-15T14:46:33Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_112<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9550<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_113<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nEffects of Positive Allosteric Modulators on Single-Cell Oscillatory Ca2+ Signaling Initiated by the Type 5 Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nBradley, Sophie J.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nWatson, Jeannette M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nChalliss, R.A.
