Introduction\nAirbus are interested in applying Friction Stir Welding to joints in the wing, centre wingbox\nand fuselage1. Some of the materials being considered are 2024, 7449 and 6013 aluminium\nalloys. Most of the development work has been empirical, for example previous work on\n20242 has used experimental methods to determine the effect of weld pitch and tool type on\nthe flow, temperature and deformation region size. Modelling of FSW can potentially\naccelerate the development process, and has been reviewed by Shercliff and Colegrove3. A\ncentral issue in all cases is the determination of the heat input. Models that predict the heat\ngeneration in Friction Stir Welding usually use some form of friction model4-35 which uses a\nconstant coefficient of friction, or by assuming a constant interface shear stress. Several\nmethods are used to calibrate heat flow models in order to determine the weld temperature.\nThe primary method is to fit the model to experimental temperature data, by adjusting the heat\ninput and the heat loss to the backing plate9-15,36. Alternative approaches use the measured\npower input to the weld as the heat input to the model18-23, or use characteristics of the weld\nmicrostructure to predict isotherms from which the heat input can be estimated8.\nNone of these approaches enable the heat generation and weld temperature to be predicted\nwithout an experimental measurement of some kind. A more accurate and predictive\napproach uses the 3 dimensional flow field to calculate the heat generation from the material\nviscous dissipation37-53. Even with these more sophisticated models there is conjecture over\nthe best ways to describe the material behaviour, and the interface between the workpiece\nmaterial and the tool, i.e. is there stick or slip. Therefore, the seemingly simple task of\npredicting the weld heat generation has proved beyond the ability of most models.\nThe emphasis of this paper is on the development of a model that predicts the weld heat\ngeneration and temperature from the flow and thermal properties of the material being\nwelded, the tool and plate dimensions and the process parameters. This model calculates the\nheat generation with a simple 2 dimensional flow calculation. As well as predicting the heat\ngeneration, this model is also used to understand the differences between hard and soft\n2materials, different rotation speeds and stick and slip conditions on the shoulder. The main\nmotivation of this work is to develop an efficient and flexible method for prediction of the\ntemperature histories for a range of alloys, to couple to models that predict the weld\nmicrostructure and strength using the models developed by Kamp and Robson54.\n2. Thermal Heat Generation Model\n2.1 Model Description\nThe modelling approach involves coupling a 3 dimensional thermal model for calculating the\nheat flow to a 2 dimensional axisymmetric flow model for calculating the heat generation. A\nflow diagram showing the coupling between these two models is shown in Figure 1. The\n\u2018Translating 3D Thermal Model\u2019 is solved in steady-state and predicts the temperature field\naround the tool from the heat flux applied at the tool-workpiece interface. This model\ncaptures the effect of tool translation. An averaged temperature field from this model is then\nimposed on the domain of the \u20182D Axisymmetric Flow Model\u2019. The temperature affects the\nflow strength or viscosity of the material in the 2 dimensional model. The \u20182D Axisymmetric\nFlow Model\u2019 calculates the flow of material through a cross-section underneath the tool\nshoulder which is shown in Figure 2. This model is solved and the effective heat flux across\nthe tool surface is found from the material flow strength. This heat flux is imposed on the\n\u2018Translating 3D Thermal Model\u2019 which is then solved using the updated heat flux. The\nprocess is repeated until the solution converges, i.e. there is no further change in the heat\ngeneration, temperature and flow fields. The starting point for the calculation is an isothermal\ntemperature distribution of 500oC. The details of these models and the coupling between\nthem are summarised in the following sections.\nThis modelling approach has several advantages over conventional 3 dimensional\nthermal\/flow models. Firstly, the 2 dimensional flow model is more computationally efficient\nthan a 3 dimensional flow model. Secondly, the thermal model is now symmetric about the\nweld centreline, so its size can be halved.\n2.2 Translating 3D Thermal Model\nThe steady-state thermal model was created in FLUENT55 and calculates the heat flow during\nwelding which involves solving the following differential equation:\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 hSTkh \uf02b\uf0d1\uf0d7\uf0d1\uf03d\uf0d7\uf0d1 \uf072v (1)\nwhere:\nv is the velocity vector and equals [vweld 0 0].\nvweld is the welding speed.\n\u03c1 is the density.\nh is the sensible enthalpy, \uf0f2TT pref dTc .\nk is the thermal conductivity.\nT is the temperature.\nSh is the volumetric heat source.\nNote that the x axis is in the welding direction, the y axis is transverse to the welding direction\nand the z axis is normal to the plate surface.\nThis model captures the effect of the tool translation, the thermal boundary conditions for the\nplate and the thermal properties of the material being welded and is used to predict the\n3temperature near the tool surface. Although FLUENT has been used in this instance, any\npackage that calculates heat flow could have been used.\nThis temperature field is then used to calculate the average temperature at a given depth, z and\nradial position, r in the 2 dimensional axisymmetric domain of the flow model. This is done\nwith the following equation:\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf070\n\uf071\uf071\n\uf070\ndzrT\nzrT\nD\nD\n\uf0f2\n\uf03d 0\n3\n2\n,,\n, (2)\nwhere:\nT2D and T3D are the 2 and 3 dimensional temperature fields respectively.\nr, z and \u03b8 are cylindrical coordinates with origin at the tool rotation axis.\nNote that \u03b8 = 0 along the positive x axis and \u03b8 = \u03c0 along the negative x axis, and that the 3\ndimensional thermal field is symmetric about the weld centreline.\nThe temperature averaging achieved with this equation is illustrated in Figure 3. This shows\nthe temperature under the shoulder in the 3 dimensional translating thermal model and the\ncorresponding average temperature in the 2 dimensional axisymmetric flow model. This\ntemperature averaging has a similar effect to the mixing induced by the rotating tool, i.e. the\nmixing results in a more uniform temperature around the tool, as demonstrated in Colegrove\nand Shercliff17.\n2.3 2D Axisymmetric Flow Model\nThe 2 dimensional axisymmetric flow model predicts the rotational flow around the tool,\nignoring the translating flow, which involves solving the following differential equation:\n0\n1 3 \uf03d\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02b\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\nr\nw\nr\nr\nrrz\nw\nr\nz\n\uf06d\uf06d (3)\nwhere:\nr and z are the cylindrical coordinates.\nw is the swirl or rotational velocity.\n\u03bc is the viscosity and equals \uf065\n\uf073\n\uf0263\n.\n\u03c3 is the material flow strength and is a function of the temperature and strain-rate. The\ntemperature is the averaged temperature from the \u20183D Translating Thermal Model\u2019.\nThe function used to determine flow strength is described in the next section.\n\uf065\uf026 is the effective strain-rate.\nThe velocity equals the rotational velocity (r\u03c9) at the tool interface and zero at the other\nboundaries, as shown in Figure 2. Slip is considered in some of the models, the details of\nwhich are described in section 5.2. The analysis ignores the translational flow past the tool\nand the effect of threads and tool features. The justification for making these assumptions is\nprovided in section 3. Once the flow has been calculated the heat flux across the pin and\nshoulder surfaces is found with:\n\uf077\uf065\uf06d rQ \uf026\uf026 \uf03d (4)\nwhich is a product of the shear stress at the surface and the wall velocity.\n2.4 The Material Flow Strength\nThe material \u2018flow strength\u2019 refers to the steady-state flow strength of the material and\n4ignores work hardening. When modelling the flow with this approach it is not possible to\ninclude the material's elastic properties. This is one reason why a coefficient of friction\ncannot be easily used, since the normal stress below the shoulder is not known. The equation\nused to describe the flow strength of aluminium alloys was proposed by Sellars and Tegart56\nand was modified by Sheppard and Wright57.\n\uf028 \uf029nA\nRT\nQ\nZ \uf061\uf073\uf065 sinhexp \uf03d\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d \uf026 (5)\nwhere:\n\uf065\uf026 is the equivalent strain-rate(\/s) and is given by:\n\u03b5\u03b5 \uf026\uf026\uf026 \uf0d7\uf03d 3\n2\uf065 (6)\nQ is the activation energy. (J\/mol)\nR is the universal gas constant. (J\/kg K)\nT is the temperature. (K)\nA,\uf061,n are material constants.\n\uf073 is the equivalent steady-state flow stress (MPa)\nWhile this relationship holds at conventional hot working temperatures, near the solidus\nsignificant softening will occur. This softening is included in the models by linearly reducing\nthe flow strength from the Zener-Hollomon value at an arbitrarily defined softening\ntemperature Tm to zero at the solidus temperature Ts. This region is called the \u2018Empirical\nSoftening Regime\u2019. A similar viscosity softening approach was proposed by Seidel and\nReynolds53. The resultant curves for the materials used in this paper are shown in Figure 4,\nand the Zener-Hollomon constants, solidus temperatures and sources of data for each of the\nmaterials is summarised in Table 1. The size of the Empirical Softening Regime (Ts - Tm) is\narbitrarily set to 50oC for each material. The effect of adjusting this temperature range is\nexplained in section 3.\n2.5 Application of the Model\nTo validate this model, it is first applied to a sample weld in 6.35mm thick 7449 aluminium\nalloy and the parameters that have the greatest impact on the heat generation are investigated.\nThe model is also compared against a fully coupled 3 dimensional thermal\/flow model to\ndetermine whether the simplification described above is valid. The model was then applied to\na series of 2024-T351 and 6013-T6 Friction Stir Welds to determine how well the model can\npredict the heat generation and weld temperature field, purely from the process parameters\nand the properties of the material being welded.\n3. Justification and Parametric Study\nSection 2 described how the 2 dimensional axisymmetric heat generation model works but\ngave no justification for using this approach. This section addresses this question by testing\nthe approach on a weld in 7449 aluminium alloy and also describes a parametric study for\nunderstanding the sensitivity of the heat input to key material and process variables. The\nmaterial softening behaviour (i.e. values of Tm and Ts) is examined because this aspect of the\ncurve has not been experimentally validated. Note that all the models in this section use a\nstick boundary condition at the pin and shoulder.\n53.1 Experimental\nThe analysis was done on a single 6.35mm thick 7449-T7351 Friction Stir Weld made at\nTWI, Cambridge using the Trivex Friction Stir welding tool52 shown in Figure 5. The Trivex\ntool had a minimum pin radius of 4mm at the tip and a maximum pin radius of 5.1mm where\nthe pin meets the shoulder and a shoulder radius of 11.5mm. A rotation speed of 350rpm and\na welding speed of 350mm\/min were used for this weld.\n3.2 Parametric Study\n3.2.1 Description\nUsing the model concept described in section 2.1 a thermal model was developed to simulate\nthe weld described above. This was virtually identical to the model described in Colegrove\nand Shercliff17,48.\nThe parametric study explores the sensitivity of the heat generation to the solidus temperature\nwhile keeping the softening regime, (Ts \u2013 Tm) equal to 50\u00b0C. A second analysis explores the\neffect of changing the softening regime size while keeping the solidus temperature constant at\n500\u00b0C.\nAnother area of uncertainty is the contact between the tool shoulder and the material being\nwelded. In welds where the tool is raked away from the direction of travel (as in this\nexperimental weld), it is often found that there is incomplete contact between the leading edge\nof the shoulder and the welded material. This is evident around the exit hole after the tool is\nwithdrawn. Another possibility is that a slip condition may exist between the welded material\nand the tool shoulder. Indeed Valberg and Malvik59 have shown that in the related process of\nextrusion a stick condition exists in some areas of the die while a slip condition exists in\nothers. Irrespective of whether the shoulder contact is complete or incomplete and whether\nstick, slip or both occur, the actual heat generation will be less than that for full shoulder\ncontact (and stick). Both these effects are accounted for by defining the \u2018contact radius\u2019 for\nthe shoulder. The parametric study investigates how the heat generation is affected by\nvarying the contact radius from 8.5mm to the actual radius of 11.5mm.\nSchmidt and Hattel47 have used an alternative method that uses full shoulder contact and a\ncoefficient of friction to describe the slip behaviour. This method results in stick on some\nparts of the tool and slip on others. Although this method may be more physically realistic it\nwas not possible to get a single coefficient of friction that is applicable in all welding\nconditions in the same way as it is possible to get a single contact radius. Furthermore the use\nof friction coefficients requires a knowledge of the normal stress under the shoulder.\n3.2.2 Results and Discussion\nFigure 6(a)-(b) show plots of the weld power versus the shoulder contact radius and the\nsolidus temperature (Figure 6(a)) and the size of the softening regime (Figure 6(b)). Note that\nan infinite solidus temperature is included in Figure 6(a) to show what happens when there is\nno material softening. These plots show that the shape of the softening regime has a smaller\neffect on the heat generation (4%) than the shoulder contact radius (20%) over the parameter\nrange investigated. The increase in heat generation with the shoulder contact radius is a\nconsequence of the greater area of contact (which increases with the square of the radius) and\nthe greater surface velocity (which increases with the radius). Note however that the\nsoftening of the material with temperature moderates this increase.\n6The relative insensitivity of the heat generation to the softening behaviour is a great\nadvantage. This means that the constitutive models described in section 2.4 can be used\ndespite the limited understanding of the behaviour at temperatures approaching the solidus.\nHowever, softening of some description as the solidus is approached is essential to avoid\nexcessive heat inputs and weld temperatures. Finally, by comparing the temperature profiles\nfrom experiment with those from the model it was possible to estimate a weld heat input of\n3kW. From Figure 6(a) this value is consistent with the model only if the shoulder contact is\nincomplete.\n3.3 Justification for the 2 Dimensional Axisymmetric Flow Model\nThe 2 dimensional axisymmetric flow model ignores many of the real process characteristics\nsuch as the flow round the tool, the profiled pin geometry of the Trivex tool (see Figure 5)\nand the flow under the pin. To determine whether these characteristics affect the heat\ngeneration significantly a coupled 3 dimensional thermal\/flow model was created in FLUENT\nwhich included all these effects. The model is divided into two Eulerian regions: a rotating\nregion around the tool where the mesh moves at the rotation speed of the tool, and a\nsurrounding stationary region, which models the flow in the far field. This model calculated\nboth the flow and thermal fields, with the heat generation coming from viscous dissipation.\nThree different contact radii were analysed with the standard material behaviour shown in\nFigure 4(a). The result of the comparison is close agreement between the fully coupled 3\ndimensional model and the 2 dimensional approximation, as shown in Figure 6(c). This\nvalidates the use of the 2 dimensional axisymmetric flow model. There are several reasons\nwhy the simplification works. Firstly, as discussed in section 2.2, the temperature averaging\nhas a similar effect to the mixing induced by the rotating tool. Therefore the averaged\ntemperature in the 2 dimensional axisymmetric flow model is similar to the temperature in the\nfully coupled model which includes material mixing. Secondly, the main determinant of the\nheat generation is the temperature at the surface of the tool, which in turn determines the flow\nstress. Provided this can be modelled reasonably accurately, the prediction of the heat\ngeneration is good. Finally, the kinematics of the process are such that rotational flow in the\nplane of the plate dominates, compared to the translational motion of the tool, and the vertical\nmotion of material induced by tool features.\nThis comparison has not included threads on the pin, which are used in most commercial\nFSW tools. A previous paper49 compared a threaded pin against a cylindrical one and found\nno difference in the heat generation when using a stick boundary condition. Hence the\ntechnique is valid for all pin profiles where the material is stuck to the pin.\n4. Application to Thin Plate 2024 and 6013\nHaving established the simplified method of predicting the heat generation and the\nimportance of the shoulder contact radius, this section applies the technique to a series of\nFriction Stir Welds in 3.2mm thick 2024-T351 and 4mm thick 6013-T6. The aim is to test the\nability of the model to predict the heat generation, and temperature field, directly from the\nflow properties and process conditions, with minimal further calibration.\n4.1 Experimental\nThe experimental welds were made at GKSS, Geesthacht Germany using the Tricept TR 805\nrobot. The plates used for the welds were 3.2mm thick 2024-T351 and 4mm thick 6013-T6\naluminium alloy and were 395mm long and 110mm wide. Prior to welding, each plate was\n7manually ground with 1200 SiC paper and cleaned with acetone. The tools used to make the\nwelds had a tapered pin with a thread and three flats with diameters of 15mm for the 2024-\nT351 welds and 13mm for the 6013-T6 welds. A scroll shoulder was used which enabled the\nwelds to be made with the tool normal to the plate surface.\nThe main aspects of the welding layout are shown in Figure 7. Six thermocouples were\ninserted in each 2024-T351 plate prior to welding and were spaced at distances of 10, 15 and\n20mm (y direction) at depths of 1 and 2.2mm from the top surface. A further 7\nthermocouples were placed in the backing bar at a depth of 0.75mm from the workpiece\nwhich enabled the heat transfer to the backing plate to be calibrated. Only 3 thermocouples\nwere used in each plate of 6013-T6 and were placed at the same distances from the centreline\n(10, 15 and 20mm) at a depth of 2mm.\nTable 2 shows the parameter combinations of welding and rotation speeds used for the 2024-\nT351 welds. A total of 14 welds were made with two welds being produced at 800 rpm and\n200 mm\/min. The vertical load (force as measured in the z direction) is indicated. Only four\nwelds were made using 6013-T6. Three had a welding speed of 900 mm\/min, with rotation\nspeeds of 1200, 1400 and 1700 rpm, while the last had a welding speed of 450mm\/min and a\nrotation speed of 900rpm.\nWeld macrosections were made of each of the welds. The rotation speed had the greatest\nimpact on the appearance of the weld macrosections with the welding speed having a minor\neffect.\n4.1.1 Traversing Force\nOn the 2024-T351 welds forces were measured with a Kistler 9366BB force table. The\ntraversing force results (x direction) are shown in Figure 8 with the data points being average\nvalues from the steady-state section of the weld. The traversing force always increased with\nwelding speed, however there is an \u2018optimum\u2019 rotation speed that minimises the traversing\nforce. For example, at a welding speed of 200-400 mm\/min the traversing force is minimised\nwith a rotation speed of 800-1200 rpm. Using a rotation speed either higher (1600 rpm) or\nlower (400 rpm) resulted in a greater value. This minimum has been observed by other\nauthors60,61, and can be explained with process modelling61\u201962.\n4.1.2 Weld Temperature\nAn example of the experimental weld thermal cycles (compared with the modelling result) is\nshown in Figure 9. The temperatures measured on the retreating side were on average 18oC\nhigher than those measured on the advancing side for the thermocouples 10mm from the tool.\nThere are two suggested causes of this effect. The first is that the difference is a consequence\nof material mixing; however, models of the process indicate that the temperature distribution\naround the tool is uniform and that if anything a hot spot occurs on the advancing side. An\nalternative explanation is that there is better contact between the welded material and the tool\nshoulder on the retreating side due to the flow and\/or side force (which may cause a small\ndeflection of the tool).\nThe temperature results from the two welds at 800 rpm and 200 mm\/min showed that the peak\ntemperature (and heat input) were dependent on the normal load. The peak temperature with\nthe higher normal load was approximately 15oC greater than the lower load weld across all\nthe thermocouple positions. Increasing temperature or heat input with normal load has also\nbeen observed by Tang et al.63 and Yan et al.60, although the effect in the latter paper was\n8weak. The increase is believed to be due to either a slightly larger area of contact between the\ntool shoulder and the welded material, or a better frictional coupling between the two because\nof the higher interface pressure.\n4.2 Description of the Model\n4.2.1 Thermal Model\nThe extensive thermocouple measurements, particularly those in the backing bar, enabled a\ngood understanding of the heat flow during the process. The combined backing bar\/vacuum\ntable (see Figure 7) made the model more complicated than using a single backing bar of one\nmaterial. Figure 7 summarises the steady-state thermal model and the boundary conditions,\nwhich are shown in grey. Only the workpiece, backing bar and tool are included with the heat\nloss under the backing bar and workpiece being modelled with convective heat transfer.\nThere are four different pathways for heat loss, which are all shown in Figure 7. The first\npathway involves the heat being transferred into the workpiece and then into the backing bar.\nTwo different contact resistances were used between the workpiece and the backing bar.\nUnderneath and behind the shoulder (shown in grey), a region with a low contact resistance,\nR1 was used because the deformation in the process flattens the surface asperities which\nresults in good thermal contact. Ahead and to the side of this region there is a much higher\ncontact resistance, R2 because these areas are not influenced by the welding process. Finally\nthe heat that is conducted into the backing bar is then lost to the body of the vacuum table and\nis modelled with convective heat transfer with coefficient hb.\nThe second pathway again involves the heat being conducted into the workpiece, however it\nis conducted further away from the tool and is lost to the vacuum table in the far field. Like\nthe bottom of the backing bar, this heat loss is modelled with convective heat transfer and has\na coefficient hv. The third pathway is similar except that heat is lost from the top surface of\nthe workpiece via convection. The convective heat transfer coefficient used is 10W\/m2K.\nThe fourth pathway is the heat that is lost through the tool via conduction. This is calculated\nby finding the 1 dimensional conductive heat loss along a tool of length 100mm with the far\nend at ambient temperature. Of the four pathways the first is by far the most significant\nfollowed by the second. The third and fourth pathways have little effect on the result, but are\nincluded for completeness. The values of the four key boundary conditions R1, R2, hb and hv\nare summarised in Table 3 and were found by trial and error: Note that with so many\nadjustable parameters, fitting the thermocouple data to the model was difficult. The values\ndetermined are not necessarily the \u2018correct\u2019 ones, but gave a reasonable fit to the experimental\ndata over a wide range welding conditions.\nConstant values of thermal conductivity of 120 W\/mK64 for 2024-T351 and 164 W\/mK65 for\n6013-T6 were used in the models. Obtaining an accurate estimate of the temperature\ndependent thermal conductivity is difficult because the value is sensitive to the condition of\nthe material, i.e. the amount of solute. Data book values66 often give the thermal conductivity\nat equilibrium and are therefore not representative of the thermal conductivity during welding\nwhere the thermal cycle is very short. However, with such a small volume of material being\naffected by the process (as represented by the HAZ), the use of room temperature values is\nreasonable and gives a better correlation with thermocouple measurements than temperature-\ndependent values.\n94.2.2 Material Constitutive Behaviour\nThe constitutive material models for both 2024 and 2014 aluminium alloys were used to\ndescribe 2024, with the details being shown in Table 1 and Figure 4(b). There are several\nreasons for including 2014 in the analysis. Firstly, 2014 is a similar alloy to 2024 but has a\nsmaller amount of Magnesium (0.2 to 0.8% compared with 1.2 to 1.8%) which results in it\nbeing softer. However, as seen in Figure 4(a), there is almost a factor of 2 difference in the\nflow strength of the two materials based on the constants from Sheppard and Jackson58. Data\nfor 2024 from an independent source (Alcan) showed the flow strength to be closer to that for\n2014. Although there was insufficient data for a constitutive model, the values suggest that\nthe very high values for 2024 from Sheppard and Jackson58 may be incorrect. Another benefit\nof including the two materials is that it enables the difference between hard and soft materials\nto be determined.\nFinally the flow behaviour of 6013 was represented by a similar alloy, 6056. The two alloys\nare almost identical apart from the composition ranges which are smaller for 6013. The\nZener-Hollomon parameters for 6056 were found by regression analysis on experimental data.\n4.2.3 Shoulder Contact Radius\nAs mentioned in section 3, the shoulder contact radius has a significant impact on the heat\ngenerated by the model and needs to be calibrated. The values that gave the best fit to the\nexperimental data were 4.8mm for the 2024 constitutive model and 5.1mm for the 2014\nconstitutive model. These values were then fixed and the thermal profiles found for the\ndifferent rotation and welding speeds.\nFinally the shoulder contact radius for the 6013 welds was found by scaling the 5.1mm value\nused for 2014 with the shoulder diameter which gave a value of 4.45mm. Note an important\ndifference between the 2024 and 6013 models. The former model was used to calibrate the\nshoulder contact radius while the latter was used to test whether this same value could be\napplied directly to a new material.\n4.2.4 Heat Generation and Temperature\nThe level of agreement with the experimental thermal cycles varied somewhat for different\nwelding parameters. A plot comparing one of the better predictions with the thermocouple\ndata is shown in Figure 9. One way of comparing the experimental and model results across\nall welds is to compare the peak temperature values. Figure 10 shows the difference between\nthe models described above and the experimental results at a distance of 10mm from the weld.\nA positive value indicates that the model over predicts the temperature while a negative value\nindicates that the model under predicts the temperature. The magnitude of the experimental\nvalues varied between 160oC and 310oC at this position. The values further from the tool (i.e.\nat 15 and 20mm) reflected those shown in Figure 10 but are smaller in magnitude due to the\nlower temperatures being measured. Both the 2024 and 2014 properties gave similar\ntemperature predictions as indicated in the temperature differences in Figure 10(a). The\ngreatest difference was at a rotation speed of 400rpm where the temperature with the 2024\nmaterial was greater due to a 5% higher heat generation with the harder material.\nThere are several reasons for the difference between the experimental and model results.\nFirstly, there is experimental variability, in particular in the axial load which affects the\namount the tool plunges into the material and the amount of contact between the material and\nthe tool shoulder. As shown in section 4.1.2, greater axial load increases the weld\ntemperature. Therefore one reason for the model\u2019s poor prediction of the 1600rpm and\n10\n200mm\/min weld temperature was the high axial load used for this experiment. The value of\n9kN was greater than the 6 or 8 kN used for the other welds that also used this welding speed.\nOther reasons for the discrepancy are the transient welding conditions that exist in practice,\nuncertainties in thermal conductivity, and thermal boundary conditions and the\napproximations in the heat generation model. Nevertheless the predictions are reasonable\ngiven the wide range of welding parameters and the variability in the experimental data. The\ndiscrepancies are close to the limit of accuracy in the measured temperatures\nFinally, the temperature difference for the 6013 models in Figure 10(b) shows a very good\nprediction for all four welds. As mentioned earlier, the model was being used in a predictive\nsense, since the shoulder contact radius had already been established. This result is pleasing\nand suggests that the model is able to predict the weld temperature in a new alloy provided\nsimilar tools and weld setup are used.\n4.2.5 Comparison of the Heat Generation Between 2024 and 6013\nThe heat generation in 2024-T3 and 6013-T6 is shown as a function of welding and rotation\nspeed in Figure 11(a). In order to demonstrate the effect of changing the material alone, both\nmaterials were analysed with the parameters for the 2024-T3 welds. i.e. 3.2mm thick\nmaterial, a shoulder diameter of 15mm and a contact radius of 5.1mm. Figure 11(a) shows\nhow heat generation rises to a plateau with increasing rotation speed. This characteristic is\nalso observed experimentally60.\nThe heat input is greater for 6013 than 2024, for all welding conditions except a rotation\nspeed of 400 rpm. There are two reasons for this observation. Firstly, the thermal\nconductivity of 6013-T6 (164 W\/mK) is considerably higher than that of 2024-T3 (120\nW\/mK). This increases the heat loss from the weld and results in more heat being required to\nproduce the same weld temperature. The second reason is the solidus temperature of 6013\n(579\uf0b0C) is considerably higher than the solidus for 2024 (502\uf0b0C). Therefore the temperature\nat which softening occurs is much greater which allows more heat generation, particularly at\nthe high rotation speeds. At low rotation speeds where the temperature of both materials is\nwell below their respective solidus temperatures, the heat generation is lower with 6013. This\nis because the flow strength at temperatures prior to softening is lower with 6013 than 2024.\nHence more heat can be generated with the stronger 2024 alloy.\nFinally, it is suggested that the \u2018ideal\u2019 rotation speed is at or just before the plateau in the heat\ngeneration. This corresponds to a rotation speed of 800-1000 for 2024 and 1200-1600 rpm\nfor 6013. Interestingly, this rotation speed also corresponds to the minimum in traversing\nforce (see section 4.1.1) and confirms the findings in a previous paper62. This effect is\nillustrated in Figure 11(b) which shows the heat generation, traversing force and peak\ntemperature at the shoulder and root of the weld as a function of the rotation speed for a\nwelding speed of 400mm\/min.\n5. Flow Behaviour of 3.2mm Thick 2024\nThe focus of the previous section was on the development of a model to predict the weld heat\ngeneration and temperature. In addition to predicting the heat generation, the 2 dimensional\naxisymmetric flow model also predicts the rotational flow around the tool, ignoring the tool\ntranslation. Although this model is simplified, useful information can be obtained from plots\nof the rotational flow and an analysis of the material deformation condition. The analysis is\ndone for two welding conditions only; the 1600 rpm and 200mm\/min weld and the 400 rpm\n11\nand 200mm\/min weld. The difference between the two rotation speeds and the hard 2024\nversus the soft 2014 constitutive behaviour are investigated.\n5.1 Material Deformation Condition Plots\nTo understand the softening behaviour and the differences between different rotation speeds\nand material constitutive models, plots were made of the material deformation \u2018condition\u2019.\nThis analysis identifies the temperature and flow stress of the material for each volume\nelement in the model and superimposes it on the material constitutive behaviour (from Figure\n4(b)). The material deformation condition plots in Figure 12 show contours of the probability\ndensity at a particular temperature and flow stress conditions. The concept is similar to a\nnormal plot of probability density which gives the probability of a variable having a particular\nvalue. However, the plots shown in Figure 12 have two independent variables instead of one\nand the magnitude of the probability density is shown as a contour. If the contours in these\nplots are represented with a probability density function f(T,\u03c3) where T is the temperature and\n\u03c3 is the flow stress, then the probability that a region in the solution domain has a temperature\nbetween T1 and T2 and a flow stress between \u03c31 and \u03c32 is:\n\uf0f2 \uf0f2\uf03d 2\n1\n2\n1\n),(\n\uf073\n\uf073\n\uf073\uf073T\nT\nddTTfP (7)\nInteresting differences are observed between the different plots. Using a higher rotation speed\nincreases the temperature and results in more material being deformed at very high strain-\nrates with a low flow strength. The remaining material which is at a lower temperature has a\nvery low strain rate, and will in practice be undeformed (Finite Volume Method models never\npredict zero deformation since elastic properties of the material have been ignored.). At the\nlower rotation speed the deformation is more uniform with a larger amount of material being\ndeformed with a high flow strength and strain-rate. Finally, comparing the hard 2024 material\nagainst the soft 2014 (i.e. (a,b) versus (c,d)) shows that the average strain-rate when welding\nwith the harder material is lower. This is more noticeable at the low rotation speed. Note that\nthe predicted material condition to some extent follows the constitutive law used, indicating\nthe need for better hot flow experiments, particularly approaching the solidus.\n5.2 Rotational Flow Diagrams\nThe velocity contours across a 2 dimensional slice underneath the tool shoulder are shown in\nFigure 13. One of the problems with using the Finite Volume Method to model the process is\ndefining the boundary where the material starts to deform. The boundary where the velocity\nequals 0.005m\/s was chosen as an indication of the limit of deformation and this is the last\ncontour plotted in Figure 13. It is sufficient for comparing welding conditions and model\ntypes, but this is not strictly the true extent of the plastic deformation.\nThe conditions used in Figure 13(a)-(d) are identical to those used in the material deformation\ncondition plots Figure 12(a)-(d). An additional model type (Figure 13(e)-(f)) is included in\nthis analysis using a slip boundary condition at the shoulder. Because the analysis is only\nintended to be illustrative, slip was simulated by prescribing the velocity at the shoulder. The\nvelocity was arbitrarily set equal to that of the pin where the pin and shoulder intersect, and\nthen linearly reduced to zero at the periphery. The condition on the pin remained one of stick,\nwith the material and pin velocities equal.\nThese diagrams illustrate several characteristics of the flow. Firstly, the lower rotation speed\nalways results in a greater extent of deformation under the shoulder. This effect is more\nnoticeable with the softer 2014 material (Figure 13(c)-(f)), where the deformation zone is\n12\nlarge at 400 rpm. Using the slip boundary condition reduces the deformation under the\nshoulder when compared with the corresponding stick boundary condition, particularly when\na rotation speed of 1600 rpm is used.\n5.3 Discussion and Comparison with Weld Macrosections\nBoth the rotational flow and deformation condition plot analyses show that high rotation\nspeeds and hard materials cause high welding temperatures substantially within the softening\nregime, with the deformation concentrated near to the tool surface. In contrast, low rotation\nspeeds and soft materials result in much less material entering the softening regime and a\nlarger deformation size.\nThe reduction in deformation size with increasing rotation speed is counter-intuitive, because\nthe greater surface velocity might be expected to cause more deformation. However the\nmaterial deformation condition diagrams show how the material at higher temperature rapidly\nloses flow strength as the solidus is approached. Strengthening due to the increase in strain-\nrate cannot compensate for the temperature softening \u2013 in the limit the material must\neventually slip at the tool interface. Hence the deformation localises towards the tool surface.\nThe opposite is also valid: for cooler welds where the flow strength is more uniform, so\nlocalisation of the deformation does not occur and the deformation size is larger.\nThe last two rotational flow diagrams (Figure 13(e)-(f)) are compared with the advancing side\nof the weld macrosections for the two rotation speeds in Figure 14. These models used the\n2014 properties and a slip boundary condition at the shoulder. These parameters give the\nclosest comparison with the weld macrosections. The comparisons are good, with the model\npredicting the smaller deformation region under the shoulder with the low rotation speed.\nThe good comparison between the macrosections and the model that uses a slip boundary\ncondition (particularly at 1600 rpm) suggest that this characteristic may exist in the real weld.\n6. Conclusions\nA model has been developed for predicting the heat generation and temperature field using\nthe thermal and flow properties of the material being welded, the process conditions and the\ndimensions of the tool and workpiece. This heat generation is calculated with a 2 dimensional\naxisymmetric flow model which gave a very close prediction to that from a full 3 dimensional\nanalysis. An analysis was done using a trial weld in 7449 aluminium alloy to determine the\nparameters important to heat generation. These included the constitutive behaviour of the\nmaterial, and the contact radius of the shoulder. Although some difference in the heat\ngeneration was found with different constitutive behaviour, the change was small compared\nwith changes in the shoulder contact radius.\nThis model was then applied directly to a series of friction stir welds in 3.2mm thick 2024-\nT351 and 4mm thick 6013-T6. The shoulder contact radius was calibrated with the 2024\nwelds which enabled a good correlation with the thermocouple data over a wide range of\nprocess conditions. The different axial loads (plunge) used for the experimental welds\nexplains some of the discrepancy. Using the calibrated shoulder contact radius, the model\nwas then applied to the 6013-T6 welds. The correlation with the experiments was good,\nindicating that the model can be used to predict the weld temperature of a new alloy if the\nflow and thermal properties are known.\n13\nTwo novel techniques were used to analyse the flow from the 2 dimensional axisymmetric\nflow model: material deformation condition plots and rotational flow diagrams. In this\nanalysis high and low rotation speeds were compared as well as the effects of hard versus soft\nmaterials, stick versus slip boundary conditions at the shoulder, and different sizes of the\nsoftening regime in the constitutive model. The material deformation plots showed how\nhigher rotation speeds caused a higher welding temperature, with more of the material being\ndeformed in the \u2018Empirical Softening Regime\u2019 at a very high strain-rate and low flow\nstrength. Using the harder constitutive response of 2024 material had a similar effect to the\nhigh rotation speed in that most of the material deformation was at a very high strain-rate and\nlow flow strength.\nThese findings were reflected in the rotational flow diagrams, which showed that the\ndeformation under the shoulder was greater at a lower rotation speed. This agreed with the\nflow indicated by the weld macrosections. Both high rotation speeds and harder materials\ncaused more localised deformation near the tool surface. Finally, there appeared to be a better\ncorrelation between the weld macrosections and the rotational flow diagrams from the model\nwhen a slip boundary condition was used at the shoulder, particularly at the high rotation\nspeed.\nAlthough it appears that the boundary condition at the shoulder is likely to be slip, obtaining\nvalues for the surface shear stress is difficult because the limiting interfacial shear stress will\nbe sensitive to the temperature, the slip velocity and the normal stress. The alternative\napproach adopted here of using a stick boundary condition with an artificially small shoulder\ncontact radius may be less physically realistic, but gives a much simpler model for predicting\nthe heat generation which works well.\n7.
