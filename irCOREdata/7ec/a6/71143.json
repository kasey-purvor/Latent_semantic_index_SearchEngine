A numerical solution of the problem on dynamics\nof shear-mode Alfve\u00b4n waves in the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n res-\nonator (IAR) region at middle latitudes at nighttime is pre-\nsented for a case when a source emits a single pulse of dura-\ntion \u03c4 into the resonator region. It is obtained that a part of\nthe pulse energy is trapped by the IAR. As a result, there oc-\ncur Alfve\u00b4n waves trapped by the resonator which are being\ndamped. It is established that the amplitude of the trapped\nwaves depends essentially on the emitted pulse duration \u03c4\nand it is maximum at \u03c4=(3\/4)T , where T is the IAR funda-\nmental period. The maximum amplitude of these waves does\nnot exceed 30% of the initial pulse even under optimum con-\nditions. Relatively low efficiency of trapping the shear-mode\nAlfve\u00b4n waves is caused by a difference between the optimum\nduration of the pulse and the fundamental period of the res-\nonator. The period of oscillations of the trapped waves is\napproximately equal to T , irrespective of the pulse duration\n\u03c4 . The characteristic time of damping of the trapped waves\n\u03c4dec is proportional to T , therefore the resonator Q-factor\nfor such waves is independent of T . For a periodic source\nthe amplitude-frequency characteristic of the IAR has a lo-\ncal minimum at the frequency pi \/\u03c9=(3\/4)T , and the waves of\nsuch frequency do not accumulate energy in the resonator re-\ngion. At the fundamental frequency \u03c9=2pi \/T the amplitude\nof the waves coming from the periodic source can be ampli-\nfied in the resonator region by more than 50%. This alone is\na basic difference between efficiencies of pulse and periodic\nsources of Alfve\u00b4n waves. Explicit dependences of the IAR\ncharacteristics (T , \u03c4dec, Q-factor and eigenfrequencies) on\nthe altitudinal distribution of Alfve\u00b4n velocity are presented\nwhich are analytical approximations of numerical results.\nKey words.

S. Faermark\n(mostfaer@mtu-net.ru)\n1 Introduction\nShear-mode Alfve\u00b4n waves in the ionosphere in the frequency\nrange 0.1 to 10 Hz can be reflected from regions above and\nbelow the F2-layer maximum because of large (relative to\nthe wave length in the medium) gradients of the refractive\nindex (Polyakov and Rapoport, 1981; Belyaev et al., 1990).\nThe occurrence of such reflections and the absence of a\ngroup velocity transverse to the geomagnetic field implies\nthat the resonator for shear-mode Alfve\u00b4n waves \u2013 the iono-\nspheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator (IAR) \u2013 should exist (Polyakov and\nRapoport, 1981).\nThe IAR has been identified in the ground-based observa-\ntions both at middle (Belyaev et al., 1990, 2000) and high\n(Belyaev et al., 1999) latitudes. Analysis of Freja satel-\nlite data (e.g. Grzesiak, 2000) also confirms the existence\nof this phenomenon in the topside ionosphere. The IAR\nproperties have been studied theoretically by Polyakov and\nRapoport (1981); Trakhtengertz and Feldstein (1984, 1991);\nLysak (1986, 1988, 1991); Belyaev et al. (1990); Demekhov\net al. (2000); Pokhotelov et al. (2000, 2001) and Prikner et\nal. (2000).\nThe first numerical model that fully resolved the vertical\nionospheric structure has been presented by Lysak (1997,\n1999). While previous models studied the response of the\nionosphere to waves at a fixed frequency, this model was the\nfirst that allowed one to investigate the effects in the iono-\nsphere under action of a field-aligned current pulse with ar-\nbitrary time dependence generated by a source of this current\nin the magnetosphere.\nIn this paper a numerical model of similar type is used but\nwith another position of the source and a number of simplifi-\ncations specified by the statement of the problem. The main\nobjective of this work is to analyse features of trapping by\nthe ionospheric resonator of a single pulse of a shear-mode\nAlfve\u00b4n wave for the case when the energy losses of the wave\nat the E-layer heights are insignificant. This corresponds to\nnight-time conditions at middle latitudes which according to\nobservation data, the IAR Q-factor is relatively high (Belyaev\net al., 2000). The E-layer is optically thin at frequencies\n500 V. V. Alpatov et al.: Dynamics of Alfve\u00b4n waves\nlower than 5 to 10 Hz for these geophysical conditions, and\nit allows us to use integrated conductivity of the ionosphere.\nBesides, low losses of energy of shear-mode Alfve\u00b4n waves\nat the E-layer heights allow us to neglect the connection of\nthese waves with isotropic fast compressional waves. This\nconnection was the focus of Lysak\u2019s (1997, 1999) results.\nTherefore, Lysak\u2019s (1997, 1999) model is two-dimensional\nwhile our model is one-dimensional. Note that a single pulse\nof Alfve\u00b4n wave is generated at an artificial action (chemical\nrelease experiment or rocket exhaust gases) in the ionosphere\n(see, e.g. Marklund et al., 1987; Gaidukov et al., 1993; Demi-\nnov et al., 2001). Therefore, we put a source of Alfve\u00b4n waves\ninside the resonator, more precisely, at the heights close to\nthe upper border of the E-layer.\nThe other purpose of this work is to compare character-\nistics of the Alfve\u00b4n waves generated by a pulse source and\ntrapped by the resonator with characteristics of the Alfve\u00b4n\nwaves generated by a periodic source and retained by the res-\nonator. Therefore, two versions of the Alfve\u00b4n wave genera-\ntors \u2013 a single pulse and a periodic wave \u2013 will be considered\nbelow.\n2 Formulation of the problem\nPropagation of magnetohydrodynamic waves in three regions\nis taken into account: in the upper ionosphere at the heights\nh\u2265h0\u2248150 km, where the plasma is magnetized and iner-\ntial currents are important; in the E layer of the ionosphere\n(h0\u2265h\u2265hB\u2248100 km), where ionospheric conductivity cur-\nrents are important; and in the electrically neutral atmosphere\nbetween hB and the highly conducting surface of the Earth,\nwhere there are no charges and currents if the displacement\ncurrent is neglected (see, e.g. Nishida, 1978).\nIt is assumed that background electric fields and currents\nare absent, i.e. the high-latitudes conditions are not con-\nsidered. We shall consider only the shear-mode Alfve\u00b4n\nwave, i.e. the effects of transformation of this wave into the\nisotropic fast compressional wave will be neglected. There-\nfore, in what follows for brevity the shear-mode Alfve\u00b4n wave\nwill be called the Alfve\u00b4n wave or simply the wave. The sys-\ntem of equations for Alfve\u00b4n waves in the upper mid-latitude\nionosphere is\n1\/(\u00b50V 2A) \u00b7 \u2202\/\u2202t\u2207\u22a5 \u00b7E=\u2212\u2202Jz\/\u2202z, (1)\n\u00b50\u2202Jz\/\u2202t=\u2212\u2202\/\u2202z\u2207\u22a5 \u00b7E, (2)\nwhere the z axis is directed upwards opposite to the geo-\nmagnetic field (ez=\u2212B0\/B0), Jz and \u2207\u22a5\u00b7E are the field-\naligned current and divergence of the wave electric field,\nrespectively, the field E is orthogonal to B0, VA is the\nAlfve\u00b4n velocity, and \u00b50 is the magnetic permeability of free\nspace. The first equation is deduced from the current conti-\nnuity condition and from Ohm\u2019s law for collisionless plasma\nJ\u22a5=1\/(\u00b50V 2A)\u2202E\/\u2202t (see, e.g. Nishida, 1978). The sec-\nond equation is the consequence of Faraday\u2019s and Amper\u2019s\nlaws. Note that Eqs. (1) and (2) coincide with the equations\nof Lysak\u2019s detailed model (1997, 1999), if in Lysak\u2019s equa-\ntions one neglects collisions, assumes that the cross scale of\nthe wave is not too small, and takes into account that for the\nAlfve\u00b4n wave the following condition is valid:\n\u2207\u22a5\u00d7E=0. (3)\nThe continuity equation for the current can be written as\n\u2202Jz\/\u2202z+\u2207\u22a5 \u00b7 (J\u22a5+J ext\u22a5 )=0, (4)\nwhere J ext\u22a5 is the transverse component of extrinsic current\nwhich is considered as a source of waves. Taking into ac-\ncount Eq. (3), the continuity equation in the conducting layer\ncan be written as\n\u2202Jz\/\u2202z+\u2207\u22a5 \u00b7 (\u03c3pE+J ext\u22a5 )=0, (5)\nwhere \u03c3p is the Pedersen conductivity of the ionosphere. For\ndefiniteness, we place the source inside the conducting layer.\nIn Sect. 5 we shall return to this question and show that our\nconclusions basically do not depend of the source localiza-\ntion. The conducting layer was assumed to be optically thin,\nand Eq. (5) was integrated over z from the bottom up to the\ntop border of the conducting layer. Taking into account that\nat the bottom border of the conducting layer there are no cur-\nrents, we obtain the boundary condition for the system of\nEqs. (1) and (2) at the height h=h0=150 km:\nJz(h0=150 km)=(\u22126p\u2207\u22a5 \u00b7E\u2212\u2207\u22a5 \u00b7 \u222bJ ext\u22a5 dz)\/ sin I, (6)\nwhere 6P is the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity of\nthe ionosphere and I is the magnetic inclination. The bound-\nary condition (Eq. 6) is the condition of short circuit of the\nsource current by conductivity currents and the field-aligned\ncurrent of the wave. It allows us not to consider propagation\nof the waves at the region below the E-layer.\nThe processes inside the source are not studied here, there-\nfore, we put\n\u2212\u2207\u22a5 \u00b7 \u222bJ ext\u22a5 dz=J0F(t),\nwhere |F(t)|\u22641. For this case, the wave is radiated into the\nregion h>h0, and J0 is the amplitude of the field-aligned cur-\nrent of this wave close to the source, if energy losses of this\nwave in the E-layer are neglected.\nThe upper boundary h1 for Eqs. (1) and (2) is located\nabove the IAR. At this height the condition for radiation of\nwaves along the geomagnetic field into the magnetosphere\nis specified and the subsequent reflection of waves from the\nconjugate ionosphere is ignored.\nThe system of Eqs. (1) and (2) was solved numerically\nby the method of characteristics (see, e.g. Rozhdestvensky\nand Yanenko, 1978) in the following variables (Riemannian\ninvariants):\np=\u2207\u22a5 \u00b7E+RJz, q=\u2207\u22a5 \u00b7E\u2212RJz, (7)\nwhere R=\u00b50VA=1\/6A, and 6A is the wave conductivity.\nUsing these variables, the system of Eqs. (1) and (2) takes\nthe characteristic form\n(1\/VA)\u2202p\/\u2202t+\u2202p\/\u2202z=D, (1\/VA)\u2202q\/\u2202t\u2212\u2202q\/\u2202z=D, (8)\nV. V. Alpatov et al.: Dynamics of Alfve\u00b4n waves 501\nwhere D=0.5 (p\u2212q)\u2202ln(VA)\/\u2202z. Boundary conditions for\nEq. (8), taking into account Eq. (6), are\np[1+6P \/(6A sin I )]\u2212\nq[1\u22126P \/(6A sin I )]=2J0F(t)\/6A for h=h0, (9a)\nq=0 for h=h1. (9b)\nFrom Eq. (8) it is seen that the wave p propagates only\nupwards, and q only downwards. The boundary condition\n(Eq. 9b) is the condition for radiation of the whole wave up-\nwards into the magnetosphere at the upper boundary, so that\nno part of this wave is reflected downwards. Equations (7) to\n(9) are the formulation of the problem. Note that the waves\np and q are always present simultaneously in a non-uniform\nmedium (\u2202ln(VA)\/\u2202z 6=0), and the termD in Eq. (8) describes\nthe redistribution of energy between these waves. In this for-\nmulation of the problem the direction of Pointing vector of\nthe Alfve\u00b4n wave coincides with Jz. Therefore in what fol-\nlows the main attention will be given to the dynamics of the\nfield-aligned currents in the IAR region.\n3 Geophysical conditions\nFrom ground-based observations at middle latitudes it is\nknown that the IAR Q-factor is maximum at night (Belyaev\net al., 2000). Figure 1a shows the altitude distribution (along\nthe geomagnetic field) of the Alfve\u00b4n wave refractive index\nnA=c\/VA obtained using the IRI model (Bilitza, 1997) for\nmedium solar activity \u2013 a relative sunspot number W=70,\nmiddle latitudes \u2013 an L-shell equal to 1.8, in February, at\nmidnight.\nThe analytical approximation of nA altitude distribution\nfor the F2-layer, where O+ ions dominate, is\nnA=nAm exp(0.25(1\u2212x\u2212 exp(\u2212x))), x=4(h\u2212hm)\/L, (10)\nwhere hm is the height of nA maximum for which\nnA=nAm=c\/VAm and L is the characteristic scale of the nA\nchange with height for h>hm. In the case under consid-\neration nAm=407, hm=345 km, and L=240 km. Note that\nqualitatively the relation L=L(O+)=2k(Te+Ti)\/m(O+)g is\nvalid for the F2-layer in the region above the layer maxi-\nmum. Above the F2-layer, in the protonosphere, where H+\nbecomes the dominant ion, the characteristic scale of nA in-\ncreases with height. At the heights where protons domi-\nnate (N (H+)\u001dN (O+)) the scale is given by 1\/L=1\/L(H+)\n=0.5m(H+)g\/k(Te+Ti)+\u2202ln(B0)\/\u2202z, where B0 is the geo-\nmagnetic field and \u2202ln(B0)\/\u2202z\u2248\u22123\/(RE+h). The height\nwhere 1\/L(H+)=0 corresponds to nA minimum. In our\ncase this nA minimum is located close to 1300 km, and the\nprotonosphere is located higher than 700 km.\nIn what follows, the region near the nA maximum is called\nthe central part of the IAR. The upper and lower walls of the\nIAR are located above and below the central part of the IAR\nwhere nA decreases with distance from this central region. In\nthe considered case the lower wall of the IAR is very steep\nand extends to the upper boundary of the E-layer at 150 km.\n 21 \nFig. 1 to the paper by V.V.

Numerals at the curves\nare times t in seconds from the turn on of the pulse source. The\nduration of the pulse is \u03c4=pi \/\u03c9=0.68 s.\nThe upper wall is less steep and extends up to \u22481300 km\nwhere nA=nAmin=66. In this case the condition (Eq. 9b) for\nradiation of the wave into the magnetosphere is specified at\nthe height h=h1=1500 km, i.e. higher than the IAR.\nBy analogy with analytical studies of the resonator\n(Polyakov and Rapoport, 1981; Lysak, 1991) we designate\nthe depth of the resonator as \u03b5:\n\u03b5=nAmin\/nAm. (11)\nIn the considered case \u03b5=0.16.\nIn Eq. (6) it was taken that the conducting E-layer is opti-\ncally thin for the Alfve\u00b4n wave of frequency \u03c9. This condition\nis valid if (see, e.g. Lysak, 1999):\n\u03b4=(2\/\u00b50\u03c9\u03c3P )1\/2\u001dLP ,\nwhere \u03b4 is the skin-depth, LP is the width of the conductive\nlayer of the ionosphere, 6P=LP \u03c3P . In this case \u03c3P=2\u00b710\u22126\nmho\/, 6P=0.05 mho, LP=25 km, and the conductive layer is\noptically thin for frequencies f=\u03c9\/2pi\u001c100 Hz. Hence, for\nthe analyzed range of frequencies 0.1 to 10 Hz the condition\nis valid so long as the conductive layer of the ionosphere is\nthin.\nNote one of the consequences of Eq. (10). For this pur-\npose we take into account that at middle latitudes the change\nin height by dh corresponds to a distance along the geomag-\nnetic field ds=dh\/ sin I . If one accepts that Eq. (10) is valid\nat all heights and sinI does not depend on height, then in-\ntegration of 2 (nA\/c) along the geomagnetic field from the\nEarth\u2019s surface up to infinity gives the period of movement of\nthe Alfve\u00b4n wave between these boundaries (bounce period):\nTbmax=(1\/\n\u221a\n2) exp(1\/4)0(1\/4)(L\/ sin I )\/VAm\n=3.29(L\/ sin I )\/VAm,\nwhere 0(1\/4) is a Gamma function. In this case Tbmax=1.2 s.\nThis value of Tbmax remains constant if the bottom border of\n502 V. V. Alpatov et al.: Dynamics of Alfve\u00b4n waves\n 22 \nFig. 2 to the paper by V.V.

Time is measured from turn on\nof the pulse source.\nintegration is located at the height h0=150 km. Integration\nbetween the bottom and top borders of the F2-layer (in this\ncase from 150 up to 700 km) gives Tb=1 s. It is seen that\nthe Tb value does not strongly differ from Tbmax and the dif-\nference between them is near 20%. It allows us to assume\nthat Tb dependence on the ionosphere parameters is similar\nto above Tbmax dependence on these parameters:\nTb=2.7(L\/ sin I )\/VAm, b=2pi\/Tb=2.3(VAm\/L) sin I. (12)\nEquation (12) can be considered as analytical approxima-\ntion of numerical solution of this problem which is applica-\nble for the whole really observed range of nAm, L and hm\nchanges in Eq. (10). Comparison of Tbmax and Tb shows that\nthe inaccuracy of such approximation is smaller than 20%.\nThis property of Eq. (10) is used below for the approxima-\ntion of the IAR eigenfrequencies.\n4 Single pulse of the Alfve\u00b4n wave\nLet the function F(t) in the boundary condition (9a) be\nF(t)= sin(\u03c9t) for 0\u2264t\u2264pi\/\u03c9; F(t)=0 for t>pi\/\u03c9, (13)\ni.e. the source radiates upwards (into the region h>h0) an\nAlfve\u00b4n wave as a pulse of duration \u03c4=pi \/\u03c9. The field-aligned\ncurrent amplitude of this wave near the source is equal to J0 if\none neglects the Alfve\u00b4n wave energy losses into the E-layer.\nBelow we consider relative changes in the field-aligned cur-\nrent of the Alfve\u00b4n waves Jz\/J0 in the IAR region.\nWe put frequency \u03c9=4.6 s\u22121 (f\u22480.7 Hz) which corre-\nsponds to the pulse duration of the emitted Alfve\u00b4n wave\n\u03c4=0.68 s. Figures 1b and c show the altitude distribution of\nthe field-aligned current of the Alfve\u00b4n waves Jz\/J0 for fixed\ntimes t from the moment the source was switched on. At\nt=0.34 s the generated pulse is maximum near the source. At\nthis time just above the source (h\u2248150 km) the field-aligned\ncurrent is Jz\/J0=0.925, i.e. the energy losses in the E-layer\ndo not exceed 7 to 8% (see Eq. 9a), and reflection of the\nwaves from the IAR lower wall is almost specular. By the\ntime the source is switched off (t=0.68 s) the pulse maximum\nreaches the IAR upper wall. At this time Jz>0 in the whole\nIAR region. At further propagation of the pulse some part\nreflects from the IAR upper wall and then reflects from the\nlower wall. As a result, a region is formed where Jz<0. At\nt=0.9 s this region is located below approximately 450 km.\nAt t=1.1 s a very wide maximum of the pulse reaches the\nIAR upper wall. By this time Jz<0 in the whole region of\nthe F2-layer (200\u2264h\u2264600 km) and Jz minimum is located\nin the central part of this region. This extremum is formed\nby p and q waves in which Jz<0 (see Eq. 7). The q wave\nis the wave reflected from the upper wall of the resonator\nand after that it reaches Jz minimum. The p wave is associ-\nated with the q waves from previous times where it reached\nthe lower wall of the resonator, then reflected from this wall\nand reached Jz minimum. At t>1.1 s the p and q waves\ncontinue their movement and, having reflected from the res-\nonator walls, reach the central part of the resonator again.\nThey form Jz maximum, as at this time Jz>0 in the p and q\nwaves due to their reflections. In Fig. 1 this maximum is seen\nat t=1.5 s. These are just the oscillations of the Alfve\u00b4n waves\nbetween the resonator upper and lower walls, i.e. the waves\ntrapped by the resonator. The frequency of these oscillations\nis \u22486.9 s\u22121.\nIt was noted above that reflections of the waves from the\nIAR lower wall are almost specular and the energy losses in\nthe E-layer are insignificant. The energy losses through ra-\ndiation to the magnetosphere are important. This is evident\nfrom the sharp decrease in Jz\/J0 at the heights h>800 km\nat transition from t=1.1 to t=1.3 s when the main maximum\nof the Alfve\u00b4n wave pulse crosses the IAR upper boundary.\nTherefore, most of the energy of the waves trapped by the\nresonator is concentrated close to the central part of the res-\nonator, i.e. at the heights of the F2-layer. This is evident\nfrom Fig 2, where Jz\/J0 dependences on time at three fixed\nheights are shown for different durations of the emitted pulse\nof the Alfve\u00b4n wave. Secondary maxima of Jz\/J0 are most\ndistinct near the IAR central part at the height h=400 km, but\nthey are much weaker at h=600 km and practically absent at\nh=200 km. At the height of 400 km the intervals between\nmaxima, beginning with the second maximum (for a short\npulse, with the third one), almost do not depend on the emit-\nted pulse duration: T =0.91\u00b10.04 s. The value T\u22480.91 s is\nthe fundamental period of the IAR which corresponds to the\nfundamental frequency of the resonator \u22486.9 s\u22121.\nThe frequency  is determined by internal properties of\nthe resonator, i.e. depends only on the altitude distribution of\nthe Alfve\u00b4n wave refractive index nA in the resonator region.\nAn approximation of this dependence, taking into account\nV. V. Alpatov et al.: Dynamics of Alfve\u00b4n waves 503\nEq. (10), is\n\u22482.6(c\/nAmL) sin I\u22482.6(VAm\/L) sin I. (14)\nThe fact that most of the wave energy trapped by the res-\nonator is concentrated at the F2-layer heights was taken into\naccount in deducing Eq. (14). Therefore,  dependence on\nthe ionosphere parameters is similar to the one for b (see\nEq. 12). Calculations show that for night hours at middle lat-\nitudes Eq. (14) is valid for any level of solar activity and for\nany season with a deviation of less than 15 to 20%.\nIf approximation (Eq. 10) is used, the IAR fundamen-\ntal period corresponds approximately to the double time of\nthe Alfve\u00b4n wave propagation from 200 up to 600\u2013650 km.\nHence, almost the whole F2 region participates in the for-\nmation of the trapped waves. Height h\u2217\u2248hm+L\/4\u2248400 km\ncorresponds to the half time of the wave propagation at the\ndistance from 200 to 650 km. This height corresponds to the\narea of peak values of Jz\/J0 in the trapped waves, as super-\nposition of the waves reflected from the top and bottom walls\nof the resonator occurs in this area (see Figs. 1 and 2). The\ndistance from 200 km up to hm is half the interval from hm\nup to 650 km, and for qualitative estimations one can take\nthe characteristic scale of nA change in the region of the res-\nonator bottom wall to be equal to 0.5L.\nThe waves trapped by the resonator are damped out (see\nFig. 2). Their characteristic damping time \u03c4dec can be found\nfrom the ratio of Jz\/J0 maxima in the central part of the res-\nonator, beginning with the second maximum, i.e. the ratio of\nthe second maximum to the third one, etc. In the considered\ncase \u03c4dec\/T\u22480.95\u00b10.1 irrespective of the emitted pulse du-\nration. Additional calculations at fixed T show that \u03c4dec\u223c1\/\u03b5\nfor the case when energy losses of the waves in the E-layer\ncan be neglected. Similar dependence of \u03c4dec on \u03b5 also fol-\nlows from the analytical solution of the problem for a peri-\nodic source (Belyaev et al., 1990). Therefore, approximately\n\u03c4dec=(0.15\/\u03b5)T=(0.15\/\u03b5)2pi\/. (15)\nCalculations for mid-latitude winter conditions at near-\nmidnight hours at low, middle and high solar activity show\nthat the inaccuracy of approximation (Eq. 15) does not ex-\nceed 10 to 15%. Nevertheless, it should be noted once more\nthat this approximation is applicable only for a case when\nenergy losses of the waves in the E-layer can be neglected.\nThe resonator Q-factor is usually calculated as a ratio of\nthe real part of the resonator eigenfrequency \u03c9\u2217 to its imag-\ninary part: Q=0.5 Re (\u03c9\u2217)\/Im(\u03c9\u2217). In the considered case\nRe(\u03c9*)=, Im(\u03c9\u2217)=1\/\u03c4dec for the trapped waves, and it fol-\nlows from Eq. (15) that the IAR Q-factor for these waves is\nQ\u22480.5\/\u03b5. (16)\nFor the reasons noted above this equation is valid only for a\nversion when energy losses of the waves in the E layer can\nbe neglected.\nThe amplitude of the trapped waves (Jz\/J0)max depends on\nthe duration of the emitted pulse pi \/\u03c9. Here (Jz\/J0)max has its\n 23 \nFig. 3 to the paper by V.V.

This amplitude is maximum when\n\u03c9=\u03c9R\u2248\/1.5. (17)\nThe frequency \u03c9R corresponds to the pulse duration\n\u03c4R=pi \/\u03c9R , and from Eq. (17) it follows that the amplitude\nof the waves trapped by the resonator is maximaum at the\nemitted pulse duration\n\u03c4=\u03c4R\u2248(3\/4)T .\nWe name \u03c9R as the optimum frequency of the emitted pulse.\nIt is seen that this frequency is smaller than the resonator fun-\ndamental frequency. It is caused by the fact that (Jz\/J0)max\nis formed as a result of superposition of the waves reflected\nfrom the resonator bottom and top walls which have been\nformed by one pulse of the wave emitted upwards. The wave\nreflected from the resonator bottom wall passes twice to the\nIAR central part, more precisely, to the height h\u2217\u2248400 km:\nit is reflected from the lower part of the top wall and then\nis reflected once more from the bottom wall. The wave re-\nflected from the upper part of the resonator top wall passes\nonce to h\u2217. The numerical coefficient 1.5 in Eq. (17) cor-\nresponds to optimum conditions when the times of passage\nof these waves are in agreement between themselves.

A clear main maxi-\nmum (Jz\/J0)max=0.235 is seen in it which corresponds to\nthe frequency \u03c9R=\/1.5. At a lower frequency \u03c9\/\u22480.2\nan additional maximum is seen where (Jz\/J0)max=0.192.\nFor \u03c9\/<0.2 the amplitude of the trapped waves decreases\nquickly with decreasing frequency, despite the increase of\ntime integrated energy in the pulse emitted by the source.\nThe frequency of the waves trapped by the resonator is\nclose to . These waves are generated by a pulse from\nthe source, and each of the trapped waves is damped out.\nIf the frequency is \u03c9\u001c, then only the waves generated\nduring the last passage of the emitted pulse through the res-\nonator can be detected as trapped waves separately from this\npulse. The characteristic time of this pulse decrease is ap-\nproximately equal to 1\/\u03c9. The trapped waves can be de-\ntected separately if this time is smaller than the characteristic\ntime of damping of the trapped waves (see Eq. 14), i.e. if\n1\/\u03c9<2pi\/ or \u03c9\/>1\/2pi\u22480.16. The low-frequency maxi-\nmum at \u03c9\/\u22480.2 corresponds to this condition.\n5 Periodic Alfve\u00b4n wave\nLet function F(t) in the boundary condition (Eq. 9a) be\nF(t)= sin(\u03c9t) for t\u22650, (18)\ni.e. the source is switched on at time t=0 and radiates a pe-\nriodic Alfve\u00b4n wave. After some time a periodic process will\nbe established in the resonator region whose amplitude will\nnot vary in time.\nThe process of a steady-state establishment for \u03c9= is\nshown in Fig. 4. It is seen that it takes t\u22488T for the solu-\ntion to come to a steady-state where T =2pi \/. But even at\nt=4T the amplitude of the waves retained by the resonator is\nnot very different from the maximum one: (Jz\/J0)max=1.55,\n1.62 and 1.63 at t=4T , 8T , and 10T .\nFigure 3b shows the amplitude-frequency characteristic of\nthe resonator for the steady-state situation, where (Jz\/J0)max\nis the greatest value of Jz\/J0 maximum in the height interval\n200 to 800 km. It is seen that for a wide range of frequen-\ncies (Jz\/J0)max>1, i.e. the energy which has come from a\nperiodic source can be stored by the resonator and exceed\nthe losses due to radiation into the magnetosphere. At the\namplitude-frequency characteristic of the resonator a num-\nber of maxima can be seen. The frequencies corresponding\nto these maxima are resonant frequencies.\nTable 1 gives the resonant frequencies \u03c9n and (Jz\/J0)max\nvalues for the steady-state situation. The approximation of\nthese frequencies for 1\u2264n<10 is\n\u03c9n=\n[\n(n+0.5)\/1.5\u22120.009(n\u22121)2\n]\n. (19)\nTable 1 shows that the approximation (Eq. 19) is suffi-\nciently exact. Note that the contribution of the nonlinear\nterm in Eq. (19) becomes appreciable only at n >5. There-\nfore, it can be neglected in most cases of practical interest.\nIn Fig. 3b, the most clear (Jz\/J0)max maximum is seen at the\nfundamental resonant frequency \u03c91=. As the frequency in-\ncreases, the (Jz\/J0)max maxima become less distinct. The\nmain part of energy of the waves retained by the resonator is\nconcentrated close to the central part of the resonator in the\nheight interval h\u2248hm\u00b10.25L. It is evident from Fig. 5, that\nthe dependences of Jz\/J0 on height are given for the first four\nresonant frequencies at fixed points in time when for each of\nthese frequencies the (Jz\/J0)max value becomes maximum at\none of these points. In the considered case these maxima\nare located at the heights 390, 340, 315 and 295 km for the\nresonant frequencies \u03c91, \u03c92, \u03c93, and \u03c94, correspondingly.\nV. V.

In order to check this conclusion we have in ad-\ndition solved the problem on eigenvalues when in the initial\nEq. (8) the derivative on time is replaced with the complex\nfrequency which was determined from the problem solution.\nThe real values of the resonator eigenfrequencies obtained\nfrom this solution differ from the approximation (Eq. 19) by\nless than 4% for n<10. It implies, in particular, that resonant\nfrequencies will not change if the periodic source is placed\nin the magnetosphere, under the additional condition that the\nemitted wave frequency does not change over the wave prop-\nagation way from the source to the IAR.\nNote that if one sets formally n=0.5 in Eq. (19) then the\noptimum frequency \u03c9R can be obtained for a single pulse\n(Eq. 17) when the amplitude of the waves trapped by the\nresonator is maximum. Nevertheless, the difference be-\ntween dependences of amplitudes of trapped and retained\nwaves on frequency is essential. For example, Fig. 3 shows\nthat for a periodic source with frequency \u03c9=\u03c9R the am-\nplitude of retained waves corresponds to a local minimum\n((Jz\/J0)max=0.98), i.e. the energy of the waves with this\nfrequency is not accumulated by the resonator. For a sin-\ngle pulse of duration \u03c4=pi \/\u03c9R the amplitude of the trapped\nwaves is maximum ((Jz\/J0)max=0.235). In turn, optimum\nconditions for trapping the waves are at a pulse duration\nwhich does not correspond to an eigenfrequency of the res-\nonator, therefore, the amplitude of the waves trapped by the\nresonator is relatively low even for optimum conditions.\nThe above estimations were obtained for a specific kind of\ndependence of the Alfve\u00b4n wave refractive index nA on height\nh (see Eq. 10). In a more general case one can assume that\nin Eq. (10)\nx=4(h\u2212hm)\/L for h\u2265hm, x=K4(h\u2212hm)\/L for h\u2264hm, (20)\nwhere K is a numerical factor for the IAR bottom wall. The\ninterval 0.6\u2264K\u22641.4 seems to overlap a possible range of K\nchange for typical daytime and nighttime conditions at mid-\ndle and high latitudes. Analysis showed that for this range of\nK change the resonator fundamental frequency  depends\non K but \u03c9n\/ values almost do not depend on K , at least,\nfor n\u22645. It is seen more evidently from Table 2 where results\nof the solution of the problem on eigenvalues are shown for\nthe case when for the interval h0\u2264h\u2264hm the approximation\n(Eq. 10) is used in which x is described by Eq.

More de-\ntailed analysis of this property of IAR is beyond the scope of\nthis paper.\n6 Discussion\nThe above stated dependences of  and Q on nA altitude dis-\ntribution were obtained on the basis of the analytical approx-\nimation of the problem numerical solution. Similar depen-\ndences were obtained on the basis of analytical solution of\nthe problem on eigenvalues with simplifying assumptions of\nnA distribution (Polyakov and Rapoport, 1981; Lysak, 1991,\n1999). We compared both results using the above notations\nand neglecting energy losses of the waves in the E layer. For\nthe version when sin I=1,\nn2A=n2Am(\u03b52+ exp(\u22122(h\u2212hm)\/L), h\u2265hm\nn2A=n2Am, hm>h\u2265h0\n(21)\nand \u03b5\u03c9L\/VAm\u001c1 it was obtained (Polyakov and Rapoport,\n1981) that the fundamental frequency and Q-factor of the res-\nonator on this frequency are\n=1.25piVAm\/(L+1h), Q=(1+1h\/L)\/(pi\u03b5), (22)\nwhere 1h=hm\u2212h0. For the above values of hm=345 km,\nh0=150 km, and L=240 km used we obtain 1h\/L=0.81,\n=2.2VAm\/L, and Q=0.6\/\u03b5. It is seen that the analytical re-\nsults (Eq. 22) are not strongly different from the numerical\nones (Eq. 14) and (Eq. 16). Nevertheless, the altitude dis-\ntribution (Eq. 21) apparently occurs seldom. In order to ap-\nproach a realistic situation, another sense should be given to\n1h in Eq. (22) \u2013 that it is the characteristic altitudinal scale of\nchange of the Alfve\u00b4n wave refractive index at the resonator\n506 V. V. Alpatov et al.: Dynamics of Alfve\u00b4n waves\nbottom wall. As obtained above for the nA altitudinal dis-\ntribution in the form (Eq. 10), its characteristic scale at the\nresonator bottom wall is approximately equal to 0.5L, i.e.\n1h\/L=0.5. Substitution of this 1h value into Eq. (22) gives\n=2.6VAm\/L, Q=0.5\/\u03b5, which coincides with Eqs. (14) and\n(16) at sin I=1.\nFor a simpler version when sin I=1, the nA altitude dis-\ntribution is described by Eq. (21) with h\u2265hm, the bot-\ntom boundary condition is specified at the height h=hm,\nand \u03b5\u03c9L\/VAm\u001c1; Lysak (1991) obtained that eigenfre-\nquencies of the resonator are determined by the condition\nJ0(\u03c9L\/VAm)=0, where J0 is Bessel function. Recall that the\nfirst five zeroes of J0 are 2.40, 5.52, 8.65, 11.79, and 14.93.\nHence, the resonator fundamental frequency  is equal to\n2.4VAm\/L (Lysak, 1991), and\n\u03c9n\u2248[1.305n\u22120.305], 1\u03c9=\u03c9(n+ 1)\u2212\u03c9(n)\u22481.305. (23)\nOne can see that the fundamental frequency  differs\nweakly from Eq. (14) at sin I=1, but the interval 1\u03c9 is\napproximately twice the interval resulted from Eq. (19):\n1\u03c9\u22480.67. As an illustrative example, Eq. (19) is written\nfor n=1, 3, 5, i.e. for the first odd values of n:\n\u03c92n\u22121\u2248[(2n\u22121)+0.5]\/1.5\u2248(1.33n\u22120.33). (24)\nThe odd eigenfrequencies in Eq. (19) are seen to be very\nclose to those obtained by Lysak (1991). It was noted above\nthat the scale of the resonator bottom wall is approximately\nequal to 0.5L. Therefore, simultaneous account of the upper\nand lower parts of the resonator results in the occurrence of\nadditional eigenfrequencies which correspond to even values\nof n in Eq. (19).\nWe did not take into account Hall currents, therefore we\ncannot compare our results with ground-based observations.\nNevertheless, we can present here some preliminary estima-\ntions. For daytime conditions at high latitudes on the basis\nof the solution of the general problem for a periodic source,\nLysak (1999) has obtained that in addition to the fundamental\nfrequency F=f1=0.2 Hz there are two additional maxima:\nf2=0.33 Hz and f3=0.5 Hz. Equation (19) can be rewrit-\nten as fn\u2248F(n+0.5)\/1.5. From this equation it follows that\nf2=0.33 Hz and f3=0.47 Hz, if F=0.2 Hz. It is seen that the\nfrequencies obtained by Lysak coincide almost exactly with\nthe approximation (Eq. 19). The ground effect of these waves\nhas appeared essentially different: amplitudes of the waves\nf1 and f3 are approximately 3 times as f2 amplitude (Lysak,\n1999). Therefore, on data of observations in the region of the\nresonator the interval 1f will be smaller than on the ground-\nbased data (Lysak, 1999).\nA similar conclusion can be deduced from data of\nground-based observations of the spectral resonance struc-\nture (SRS) at middle latitudes (L-shell is approximately\nequal to 2.65) in winter close to midnight at solar mini-\nmum. For these conditions the F2-layer critical frequency\nfoF2 \u22482.5 MHz; 1f=1\u03c9\/2pi\u22482 Hz is the typical value but\nsometimes 1f\u22481 Hz (Belyaev et al., 1990). This gives\nVAm\u2248870 km\/s, sin I\u22480.9. For these conditions L\u2248210 km,\nif the estimations are based on the IRI model (Bilitza,\n1997). Substitution of these values into Eqs. (14) and\n(19) gives the fundamental frequency F=\/2pi\u22481.5 Hz and\n1f\u2248F \/1.5\u22481 Hz. The obtained value is seen to coincide\nwith the minimum 1f interval of observed ones and is ap-\nproximately half the typical value of 1f\u22482 Hz. Hence, in\naccordance with Lysak\u2019s (1999) conclusions, ground-based\nobservations show that the even eigenfrequencies of the IAR\nfor the shear-mode Alfve\u00b4n waves (f2, f4, ...) are suppressed\nand distinguished less clearly than the odd eigenfrequencies.\nThese results show that taking into account the isotropic fast\ncompressional waves is important for analysis of the ground-\nbased data. At the same time the results of analysis by ne-\nglecting of these waves presented in this paper have allowed\nus to obtain explicit dependences of characteristics of the\nshear-mode Alfve\u00b4n waves on the distribution of the Alfve\u00b4n\nwave refractive index along the geomagnetic field, and thus\nhave enabled us to compare illustrative data obtained by a\nnumber of different ways and under different geophysical\nconditions.\n7 Conclusions\nA numerical solution of the problem on the dynamics of\nAlfve\u00b4n waves in the IAR region at middle latitudes at night-\ntime is presented for a case when a source emits a single\npulse of Alfve\u00b4n waves of duration \u03c4 into the resonator region.\nIt was obtained that a part of the pulse energy is trapped by\nthe resonator, i.e. damped Alfve\u00b4n waves trapped by the res-\nonator are formed. It was found that the amplitude of the\ntrapped waves depends essentially on \u03c4 and it is maximum\nat \u03c4=(3\/4)T , where T is a fundamental eigenperiod of the\nresonator. The maximum amplitude of these waves does not\nexceed 30% of the initial pulse even under optimum condi-\ntions. Relatively low efficiency of trapping Alfve\u00b4n waves is\ncaused by the difference between the optimum duration of\nthe pulse and the resonator fundamental period. The period\nof oscillations of the trapped waves is approximately equal\nto T , irrespective of the pulse duration \u03c4 . The characteris-\ntic time of damping of the trapped waves is proportional to\nT , therefore the resonator Q-factor for such waves does not\ndepend on T .\nThe situation changes dramatically when a source emits\nperiodic Alfve\u00b4n waves. The amplitude of the waves com-\ning from such a source can be increased in the resonator re-\ngion by more than 50%. This implies that the resonator can\naccumulate and retain the energy of the Alfve\u00b4n waves, de-\nspite energy losses due to radiation into the magnetosphere.\nThe amplitude of the waves in the IAR is maximum on the\nresonator eigenfrequencies \u03c9n and this effect is most pro-\nnounced when the frequency of the source coincides with the\nresonator fundamental frequency \u03c91==2pi \/T . The interval\nbetween the first adjacent eigenfrequencies of the resonator\nis 1\u03c9\u2248\/1.5.\nFor a single pulse the effective frequency \u03c9=pi \/\u03c4=\/1.5\nis optimum. For a periodic source the dependence of am-\nV. V. Alpatov et al.: Dynamics of Alfve\u00b4n waves 507\nplitude of the retained waves on frequency \u03c9 is such that\n\u03c9=\/1.5 corresponds to a local minimum and the waves of\nsuch a frequency do not accumulate energy in the resonator\nregion. This alone is the basic difference between efficien-\ncies of pulse and periodic sources of the Alfve\u00b4n waves.\nExplicit dependences of the resonator fundamental fre-\nquency , harmonics of this frequency \u03c9n, characteristic\ntime of damping Alfve\u00b4n waves trapped by the resonator, and\nthe resonator Q-factor for these waves on altitude distribution\nof the Alfve\u00b4n wave refractive index were obtained. These\ndependences are analytical approximations of the numerical\nsolution of this problem. These dependences were compared\nwith the ones obtained previously by other methods.\nAcknowledgements.
