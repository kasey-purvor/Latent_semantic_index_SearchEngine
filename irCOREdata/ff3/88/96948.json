Introduction \nMany biochemical reactions exhibit an initial fast transient followed by a slowly \nvarying change in reactant concentration. A firmly established mathematical \ntechnique for dealing with the system of ordinary differential equations describing \nsuch reactions is the quasi-steady state assumption (QSSA) or pseudo-steady \nstate hypothesis. Essential to this technique is the isolation of a small parameter \nto enable singular perturbation methods to be employed. In enzyme substrate \nkinetics this small parameter is usually taken to be the ratio of the initial enzyme \nto substrate concentration (Michaelis-Menten [ 1]). A discussion of the mathemati- \ncal treatment for this case may be found, for example, in Murray [2], while a \ngeneral reference for enzyme kinetics is Laidler and Bunting [3]. \nRecently Segal and Slemrod [4] critically re-examined a model biochemical \nreaction with a single intermediate and arrived at a dimensionless formulation \nof the problem containing a new, more general, small parameter. Their parameter \nnot only includes the traditional one as a special case, but also allows the \npossibility of a singular perturbation approach to certain problems in which the \ninitial ratio of enzyme to substrate concentration is no longer small. We refer to \n[4] for a survey of earlier results on the QSSA in the context of their new \nnondimensionalization. \n690 c.L. Frenzen and P. K. Maini \nThe purpose of this paper is to specifically illustrate the application of these \nideas to a biochemical reaction with two intermediates where the old formulation \nis not applicable, that is, where the ratio of initial enzyme to substrate concentra- \ntion is not small. Such problems appear to be particularly important in vivo, \nwhere often the latter ratio is order unity (Sols and Marcos [5]). We show that \nthe new nondimensionalization a d QSSA lead, under certain conditions, to \nsimple analytic solutions for a reaction where the ratio of initial enzyme to \nsubstrate concentration may be any fixed positive number. The reaction we have \nchosen has two intermediate steps but the methods presented in this paper may \nalso be applied to other reactions. \nIn Sect. 2 the reaction mechanism is discussed, and in Sect. 3 we nondimension- \nalize the system of ordinary differential equations describing the reaction, obtain- \ning appropriate fast and slow timescales and the new small parameter. In Sect. \n4 singular perturbation methods are used to study several different parameter \nregimes where the reaction exhibits different types of behaviour. We also compare \nour analytical results with numerical simulations of the full system. Finally, in \nSect. 5 we discuss possible applications of our work to actual biochemical \nreactions, and draw some conclusions. \n2. The reaction mechanism \nWe consider abiochemical reaction in which an enzyme (concentration E) reacts \nreversibly with a substrate (concentration S) to form an intermediate enzyme- \nsubstrate complex (concentration X). The complex X is then irreversibly transfor- \nmed into a second enzyme substrate complex (concentration Y), which in turn \nirreversibly breaks down into the original enzyme and an altered substrate \nmolecule called the product (concentration P). Perhaps the best known example \nof an enzyme-catalysed reaction that takes place in two steps is the hydrolysis \nof proteins by proteolytic enzymes, such as chymotrypsin. This process (digestion, \nto the physiologist) akes place via an acylenzyme. In molecular terms, there are \ntwo intermediates: the first is a non-covalent complex, in that no covalent bonds \nare broken nor new ones formed. The changes involving the second intermediate-- \nthe acylenzyme--do entail some chemistry; here covalent bonds in the substrate \nare broken and new covalent bonds with the enzyme are formed. A great deal \nof effort is devoted to the study of such reactions. The general reaction scheme \nis of the form \nk 1 k 2 k 3 \nS+E.  \"X .  \" Y .  \"E+P (G) \nk-1 k -2  k -  3 \nwhere the positive constants ki are reaction rates. To illustrate the method of \nmathematical nalysis, we shall restrict our study to a special case of (O), namely \nthe reaction scheme \nk I k 2 k 3 \nE+S.  \"X  ~ Y ~ E+P.  \nk-I \nHere we have made the assumption that k_  2 Y and k-3P are small in comparison \nto the other reaction rates, that is, these steps are effectively irreversible. In some \nbiochemical cases, this is a good approximation to reaction (G). The differential \nEnzyme kinetics for a two-step enzymic reaction 691 \nequations describing this reaction (using the law of mass action) are \ndS\/  dt = -k lSE  + k_ lX  (la) \ndE~dr = -k ISE  + k_ iX  + k3 Y (lb) \ndX \/ dt = k lSE - k_~X - k2X (lc) \ndY\/  dt = k2X - k3 Y (ld) \ndP\/dt  = k3 Y. (le) \nFor initial conditions we shall take \nE(0) = Eo, S(0) = So, X(0) = 0, \n(2) \nY(O) =0, P(O) = O. \nThe system (la, b, c, d, e) with initial conditions (2) implies the conservation \nequations \nE+X+ Y=Eo,  S+X+ Y+P=So.  (3a, b) \nThe QSSA may be ,applied to biochemical reactions described by systems of \nordinary differential equations in which, after an initial rapid transient, one (or \nmore) of the dependent variables may be regarded as being in steady state with \nrespect to the instantaneous values of the other dependent variables. This means \nthat the former variables, instead of appearing differentiated on the left hand \nside of a system like (la, b, c, d, e), may be approximated as algebraic functions \nof the latter variables. The occurrence of this phenomenon is suggested in the \nreaction above by experimental measurements of the combination P + Y after a \nrelatively short pre-steady state period but before the substrate concentration \nappreciably decays. Often the \"reaction rate\" (that is, the rate of formation of \nP + Y) is approximately constant over this time interval, so that by adding (ld) \nand (le) it follows that X is also approximately constant over the same time \ninterval. Consequently the approximation dX\/dt  ~ 0 may be valid for some time. \nWith this and (3a), one can solve (lc) for X in terms of S and Y, obtaining \nX = (Eo -  Y )S \/ (K  + S) (4) \nwhere \nK =- (k_, + k2)\/k~. (5) \nEquation (4) indicates that X is in steady state with respect to the instantaneous \nvalues of S and Y. The evolution of S and Y is determined by (la) and (ld), \nbut the heuristic argument above becomes difficult to carry further because of a \nlack of knowledge of the relative sizes of various terms in the equations. In some \ncircumstances, Y will be much smaller than Eo and so may be neglected in (4). \nThen using (4) in (la) yields \ndS\/dt  = -k2EoS\/ (K  + S). (6) \nIf we assume that the substrate concentration does not change appreciably during \nthe pre-steady state period, then we may use the initial condition S(0)= So \n692 C.L. Frenzen and P. K. Maini \ntogether with (6) to determine S. When Y is comparable to E0, it is not clear \nhow to proceed. Note, however, that X must increase from its initial value of \nzero relatively rapidly during the pre-steady state period, since by adding (ld) \nand (le), the rate of change of P+ Y is proportional to X. At this point \nnondimensionalization of the system is necessary to proceed systematically. \n3. Nondimensionalization: choice of scales \nBy using (3a) to eliminate E and noting that (le) can be used to determine P if \nY is known, it suffices to consider the problem \ndS\/dt  = -k lS (Eo-  X -  Y )  + k_ IX  (7a) \ndX\/  dt = k IS (Eo-  X - Y )  - (k_~ + k2)X (7b) \ndY\/  dt = k2X-  k3 Y. (7c) \nS(0) = So, X(0) = 0, Y(0) -- 0. (8a, b, c) \nThe choice of time scales is central to further development. An excellent \ndescription of scaling for problems involving QSSA can be found in [4]. For our \npurposes we note the following points: (1) dimensionless variables are obtained \nby dividing dimensional variables by their scales, the latter estimating a variable's \nmaximum order to magnitude; (2) dimensionless variables (and their dimension- \nless derivatives) are of unit order of magnitude, so that relative orders of magni- \ntude of terms in dimensionless equations can be decided by dimensionless \nparameters appearing in the equations; (3) scaling requires ome prior knowledge \nof the solution; (4) different scalings may be required in different domains for \nthe independent variables, and in different domains ofparameter space. Further \ndiscussions of nondimensionalization of systems of ordinary differential equations \nmay be found in Kevorkian and Cole [6], and Lin and Segel [7]. \nThe QSSA will often be valid when the reaction under consideration can be \nthought of as being composed of two distinct periods, the pre-steady state and \nthe steady state. During the pre-steady state \"rapid\" transients occur while the \nsubstrate concentration changes little. After this initial period of activity, the \nsystem may be described as in a steady state, some of the dependent variables \nbeing in instantaneous \"equilibrium\" with respect o others. Let us call tp and ts \nrespectively the characteristic time scales for the pre-steady state and steady state \nperiods. It is important to note that it is not the case that there will always be a \ntp and a ts scale, since this will depend on whether the system is open or closed, \nthe initial conditions and the magnitude of the reaction rates. However, we shall \nrestrict ourselves to cases where such scales do exist. If we let lower case letters \ndenote dimensionless variables and r denote the dimensionless time obtained by \nscaling the dimensional time t by the characteristic pre-steady state time tp(r = \nt\/tp), then during the pre-steady state the dimensionless variables are functions \nof ~'. We should choose appropriate scales for the pre-steady state so that dx\/d'r  \nis of unit order of magnitude and ds\/d~\" ~ O, that is, so that the dimensionless \ntime rate of change of x is order one while that of the substrate s is approximately \nzero. This is what we shall mean by the pre-steady state. \nEnzyme kinetics for a two-step enzymic reaction 693 \nOn the other hand, during the second period, the steady state, time is scaled \nby ts, and if we denote by T the dimensionless time obtained by scaling the \ndimensional time t by ts(T = t\/ts) so that steady state dependent variables are \nfunctions of T, then we should choose appropriate scales for the steady state so \nthat ds\/dT is of unit order of magnitude indicating that substrate is being used \nup. Additionally, the dimensionless derivative dx\/dT should appear multiplied \nby a small parameter, indicating that x is in a steady state with respect o the \ninstantaneous values of the other dependent variables. By seeking separate \nasymptotic expansions for the dependent variables in each of the pre-steady state \nand steady state periods and using the method of matching, we can combine \nthem to obtain a composite xpansion which is uniformly valid over the time \ninterval of interest. \nA further necessary consistency requirement is that tp << ts; the pre-steady state \nperiod consists of rapid transients during which little substrate is consumed, and \nto ensure this it is not merely sufficient to have ds\/dt small during the pre-steady \nstate. We must also require the duration of the pre-steady state (tp) to be much \nsmaller than that of the steady state (ts). \nThe following method often works well in isolating appropriate scales in \nphysical problems. We nondimensionalize the dependent and independent vari- \nables by letting \nS = as, X = hx, Y = try, t = 3% (9) \nwhere s, x and y are dimensionless variables, t is a dimensionless time, 3' is a \ncharacteristic s ale appropriate to the period under consideration, and a, h and \n7r are appropriate scales for the dependent variables. We will endeavour to choose \na, h and 7r so that s, x and y are of unit order of magnitude and a y for each \nof the pre-steady and steady state periods such that the previous consistency \nrequirements necessary for the validity of the QSSA are met. This will determine \nthe scales. \nCondition (8a) immediately ields a = So, so s(0)= 1, but (Sb, c) give no \ninformation about h and 7r. We will employ, for both the pre-steady and steady \nstates, a scaling consistent with QSSA which simplifies the appropriate quations \n[(7b) in the pre-steady state, (Ta) in the steady state] the least, that is, which \nmakes as many terms as possible in the relevant differential equation have the \nsame order of magnitude, thus in effect yielding the richest equation. (This \nprinciple is sometimes referred to as Kruskal's principle of minimum sim- \nplification; see [4].) The latter scaling arises from the belief that since we have \nno a priori reason for favouring one term over another in the equation, the most \ninteresting scaled equation (and asymptotic limit) will often result by retaining \nthe most terms. \nConsider first the pre-steady state phase. We must choose scales so that dx\/dt \nis of unit order of magnitude and ds\/dt is small. Using (9) with a = So gives for \n(Tb), after division by h, \n3'-' dx\/dt=({klEoSo}\/h)s-(k, Sos+k_,+k2)x-({k, Solr}\/h)sy. (10) \nWe find that we can make all the terms on the right-hand side of (10) have the \n694 C.L. Frenzen and P. K. Maini \nsame order of magnitude if\n(k~EoSo)\/ ), = (k~So+ k_, + k2) = (klSoCr)\/A (11) \n(where, since s=0(1)  and s changes little from its initial value s(0)= 1 during \nthe pre-steady state, we have set s = 1 in the second term on the right-hand side \nof (10)). \nEquation (11) then implies \n= t?,o, A = (EoSo)\/(So+ K) ,  (12a, b) \nwhere K is given in (5). \nIt now follows from (10) that to make dx\/dt  of unit order of magnitude we \nshould choose 3, so that \ny - [kl(So + K) ] - ' .  \nThis defines the characteristic time scale for the pre-steady state, and so defining \ntp =-- % we have \ntp ~ [kl(So + K) ] - ' .  (13) \nWith r=t \/ tp ,  the scaling in (12a, b) and a=So,  we obtain the following \ndimensionless problem for the pre-steady state: \nds \/dz=e[ -s+{o. \/ ( l+o . )}sx+sy+Kx\/{( l+K) ( l+o . )} ]  (14a) \ndx\/  dr = s - [o.\/(1 + o.)]sx - sy - x \/ (1  + o.) (14b) \ndy\/d'r = o.x\/[(1 + o')2(1 + K)] - [0\/(1 + o.)]y (14c) \ns(O) = 1, y(0) =0, x(0) =0 (15) \nwhere \ne=Eo\/ (So+K) ,  o .=So\/K ,  K=k_x \/k2 ,  O=k3\/ (k_ ,+k2) .  (16) \nBy construction, dx\/dr  is of unit order of magnitude during the pre-steady state. \nWe now see that if, as argued earlier, the dimensionless time rate of change of \nsubstrate ds \/dr  is also to be small during the pre-steady state, then from (14a) \nwe must have e << 1. The alternative possibility, that the terms in parentheses on \nthe right hand side of (14a) nearly cancel with each other is unlikely since, during \nthe pre-steady state, s changes little from its initial value s(0)= 1 while x is \nchanging with time. This conclusion suggests that the appropriate small parameter \nfor the problem is e as given in (16), and indeed this is the new small parameter \nobtained by Segel and Slemrod [4], but arrived at in a slightly different way. The \nfact that we can make ds \/dz  small by the choice of a single parameter after \ncompletely determining the scaling from (14b) lends credence to the applicability \nof the QSSA to this problem. \nIf the conventional small parameter for biochemical problems, Eo\/So, satisfies \nthe condition Eo\/So<< 1, then certainly e << 1 as well. In the laboratory, in order \nto carry out accurate experiments, it is usually, but not always, the case that \nEo<< So. However, as noted in [4], e may be small even in cases when Eo\/So is \nof order unity. In this paper we shall specifically consider the case when e << 1 \nEnzyme kinetics for a two-step enzymic reaction 695 \nand Eo\/So is an arbitrary fixed positive number, that is, we shall consider the \nlimit process in which Eo\/So is fixed and e--> 0. Since, from (16) \ne = (Eo\/So)\/[1 + (K\/So)] = [o-\/(1 + o')](Eo\/So), (17) \nthis means that we are considering the case for which Eo\/So is fixed and o-= \n(So\/K)~O. From (17), we note that \n= (So \/Eo)~ + O(~2). (18) \nOne way to think about what cr << 1 means is the following. The parameter K, \ndefined in (5), has the dimension of a concentration. I  fact, it defines a characteris- \ntic concentration for the reaction under consideration. If the ratio of the initial \nsubstrate concentration So to the characteristic concentration K is small, then \nby (16) o-<< 1. Since we regard Eo\/So as a fixed positive number, (18) implies \nthat tr and e are nearly proportional. Requiring the ratio Eo\/So to remain fixed, \nindependent of e, is not necessary - -  it is possible to regard Eo\/So as a function \nof e but this adds unnecessary complications. When Eo\/So<< 1, the traditional \napproach may be employed. In cases of interest here Eo\/So is bounded away \nfrom zero as e ~ 0. By keeping Eo\/So fixed and reducing So to make o- = So\/K << 1, \nit may even be possible to experimentally realize conditions where the QSSA \nmight be valid. Note also that, since we are holding Eo\/So fixed and a = So, \n7r = (Eo\/So)So and h = eSo, all dependent variables cale like So. \nTo coliapletely determine the solution to the above problem we must specify \nvalues for the parameters Eo\/So, K and 0, given in (16). It may happen that there \nare interesting parameter regions where K and O are tending tO zero, to infinity \nor staying fixed as e (and tr) are tending to zero. It is important to realize that \nin the present state of asymptotic analysis the notion of an asymptotic expansion \nmakes sense only in one variable, that is, one small parameter, so that if 0, for \nexample, is tending to zero as ~--> 0, then 0 should be related to some positive \npower of e by what is known as a similarity variable, a fixed, order one constant \nwhich is independent of e. This means that O = re ~ where r and t~ are fixed positive \nnumbers which do not depend on e. In a problem where there are several \ndimensionless parameters the number of possible similarity variable relationships \ncan become large, though often certain ones naturally suggest hemselves. We \nconsider some of these later. We refer to Kevorkian and Cole [6] for a discussion \nof similarity variables in several applied mathematical problems. \nProceeding now to the steady state, we assume, as is usually the case, that \nonly the time scale need be changed to obtain the dimensionless formulation for \nthis period. Returning to the scales in (9), we recall that since substrate is being \nused up during the steady state we wish to choose 3\/so that ds\/dt has unit order \nof magnitude. Using the fact that Eokl=e[k]So+k_l+k2] (see (17) and the \ndefinition of K in (5)) (7a) becomes, in dimensionless form, \n3'-' ds\/dt= e[k lSo(xs-s(1-y))+k_l (X-S(1-y))+k2(s(y-1)) ] .  (19) \nThe dimensionless variables , x and y have unit order of magnitude, e << 1 and \no-= (klSo)\/(k 1+ k2)<< 1, so in order to retain as many terms as possible on the \nright-hand side of equation (19) and to simultaneously make ds\/dt of unit order \n696 C.L. Frenzen and P. K. Maini \nof magnitude we choose \ny = [e(k-1 + k2)] -1. \nAs before, this defines the characteristic time scale ts for the steady-state \nts =- [e(k_ ,  + kz)] -L  (20) \nIt follows from (13) and (20) that \ntp\/t~ = [e (k - l+  k2)] \/ [k l (So+ K)] = e\/(1 + or) < e, (21) \nso that these time scales are consistent with the fact that the pre-steady state is \nof much shorter duratiort than the steady state. Defining T = t~ t,, and adapting \nthe scaling in (12a, b) (with a = So) to nondimensionalize (7a, b, c), yields the \nfollowing dimensionless system for the steady state, \nas~aT = o-(xs - s(1 -y ) )  + [K\/(1 + K)]X-- S(1 --y) (22a) \nedx\/dT  = tr(s(1 - y)  - xs) + s(1 - y) - x (22b) \neay\/aT = [~\/ ( (1  + ~)(1 + K))]x - oy, (22c) \nwhere e, tr, K and 0 are given in (16). Arbitrary constants appearing in the solution \nof (22a, b, c) are determined by matching to the solution for the pre-steady state, \nobtained from solving (14a, b, c), (15). We consider this in the next section. \n4. Approximate solutions \nWe employ standard singular perturbation methods to obtain approximate sol- \nutions to the dimensionless systems obtained for the pre-steady and steady state \nperiods. A solution of (14a, b, c) satisfying the initial conditions in (15) is sought \nin the form \ns( r )  = s(~ \") + es(1)(~ -) + ' \"  (23a) \nx(,c) = x(~ + ex(1)(z) +-  \f9 \f9 (23b) \ny(~.) = y(O)(~.) +ey(l)(~.) + . . . .  (23c) \nFrom (18) and K\/((1 + K)(1 +tr)) < 1, we find that regardless of the magnitude \nof the parameters 0 and K, the solution to the zeroth order problem for the \npre-steady state is given by \ns(~ = 1 \nx(~ - 1 - e -~ \ny(O)(~.) _- 0. \nRecall that the dimensional dependent variables are given by \nS = Sos, X = eSox, Y = (Eo\/So)Soy, \n(24a) \n(24b) \n(24c) \n(25) \nEnzyme kinetics for a two-step enzymic reaction 697 \nwith Eo\/So fixed as e-+ 0, so that it is necessary to compute y(U(r) to obtain the \nsame order of magnitude information about Y that (24b) yields about X. For \nK =0(1)  and 0 = 0(1), (14c), (15), (23a, b, c) and (24a, b, c) give \ndy(~\/ dr = [ So\/ ( Eo(1 + K))]x (m-  Oy (~ (26a) \ny~ = 0. (26b) \nWhen 0 # 1 and is bounded away from zero as e ~ 0 the solution to (26a, b) is \ny~ = [So\/(Eo(1 + K))][(1 - e ~ - e-~((1 - e - (~ - 1))], (27) \nwhile if 0 = 1 the solution is \nBoth (27) and \ngiven by \ny(1) ( ' r )  = [So\/(Eo(1 + K))][1 - e -\" - re- ' ] .  (28) \n(28) determine a final asymptotic value for y(l)(r) as r-+oo \nlim yl('r) = So\/(Eo(1 + K)O). \n7---~ OO \n(29) \nNote that increasing either K or 0 reduces this value. \nIf, on the other hand, 0 = 0(e) or 0 = o(e)  as e + 0, then the solution is \ny(l~(r) = [S0\/(Eo(1 + K) ) ] ( r+ e \"-- 1). (30) \nWe note that the dimensionless parameters e, tr, K, 0 remain unchanged when So \nand E0 are multipl ied by B; k_l, k2 and k3 are multipl ied by A and k~ is multipl ied \nby A~ B, where A and B are arbitrary positive numbers. Consequently the choice \nof units used in the dimensional formulation may be changed by the scalings \nabove without affecting the dimensionless formulation of the problem. \nThe linear growth in (30) indicates that the steady state value of y in these \ncases is initially 0(1). We now verify this. \nThe solution of (22a, b, c), the steady state problem, is assumed to take the form \ns( T) = so(T) + ESl( T) + ' ' '  (31a) \nX(T)  = Xo(T)  -[- 8X l (T )  -[- \f9 \f9 \f9 (31b) \ny( T) = yo( T) + ey~( T) + . . . . (31c) \nAt this point we must decide on the magnitudes of K and 0 as e-~ 0. We shall \nconsider four cases: \n(i) 0 = O(1), K = O(1); \n(ii) 0=o(e) ,K=O(1) ;  \n(iii) 0 = O(e) ,  1\/(K + 1) = O(e);  \n(iv) 0=O(e) ,K=0(1) .  \n698 C.L. Frenzen and P. K. Maini \n(0  0 = o (1) ,  K = o (1)  \nThe zeroth order problem, obtained by substituting (31a, b, c) into (22a, b, c) is \ndso \/dT  = [K\/(1 + K)]Xo- So(1 -Yo) (32a) \n0 = So(1 - Yo) - Xo (32b) \n0 = Yo. (32c) \nEquation (32b) represents he steady state relationship between So, Xo and Yo and \nis reminiscent of the dimensional relationship obtained heuristically in (4). In \nfact the two are the same for e--> 0. Equations (32b, c) imply that Xo = So, and \nusing this in (32a) gives \ndso \/dr  = -[1 + K)]So. (33) \nSolving (33) and using the matching condition between the pre-steady state and \nsteady state solutions, \nlim s(~ = lim so(T), (34) \n~-~oo T~O \nto eliminate the arbitrary constant, we find \nso(T) = e - T \/ ( I+K)  (35a) \nXo( T) = e - T\/(I+K) (35b) \nYo(T) = 0. (35c) \nThe first-order term yl(T)  is also easily obtained from (22c) when 0 = O(1), and \nmatching with the inner solution given by (27), (28) yields \nYl( T)  = [ So\/ ( Eo(1 + K)0)] e - T\/('+~). (35d) \nNote how the value of K determines the decay constant for So and Xo. We may \nform a zeroth order composite solution, for example, X~ by adding the zeroth \norder pre-steady state and steady state solutions together and subtracting their \ncommon par t - - the  limit obtained in the matching process above. The result is \nXOcomp(\/) : e - t \/ t s ( l+K) -  e - t \/ tp .  (36) \nq-K), Xcomp(t) is approximately constant ,  For times t such that t>> tp and t<< ts(1 o \nand hence so is the production of P+ Y. \n(i i) o = o(~),  ,, -- o (1 )  \nFor this case lim~o+ O\/e =0, so 0 tends to zero faster than e. The direction of \nthe reaction from Y to E + P should be less favourable than in the previous case, \nand we will find y0(T) # 0. \nThe pre-steady state solution is the same as before, (24a, b, c), while the zeroth \norder steady state problem is \ndso \/dT  = [K\/(1 + K)]Xo-So(1 -Yo) (37a) \n0 -- So(1 -Yo) - Xo (37b) \ndyo\/dT  = [So \/ (Eo(1  + K))]Xo. (37c) \nEnzyme kinetics for a two-step enzymic reaction 699 \nAgain (37a, b) imply \ndso\/dT = [ -1\/ (1  + K)]Xo (38) \nand combining this with (37c) gives \n( Eo\/ So)Yo + So = C, (39) \nwhere C is a constant. Matching as before to the pre-steady state solution implies \nC = 1, so that \nYo = [ So\/ Eo](1 - So). (40) \nEquations (37b), (38) and (40) then imply \ndso\/dr = [ -1\/ (1  + K)]((1 - So\/Eo)so+ (So\/Eo)s~). (41) \nSolving (41) and matching with the pre-steady state solution then yields \nso(T)=[1-So\/Eo]\/{exp((1-So\/Eo)T\/( l+K))-So\/Eo}, (So\/Eo~ 1) (42a) \nso(T) = 1\/{[T\/( I+K)]+I}, (So\/Eo = 1) (42b) \nNote that limT.oo so(T)=0 for Eo>~So, while limT-,oo so(T)= 1-Eo\/So>O for \nEo < So. From (38) and (40) it also follows that \nxo(T) = {(1 - So\/ Eo) 2 exp((1 - So\/ Eo) T\/(1 + K))}\/{(exp((1 - So\/ Eo) T\/(1 + K) \n- So\/Eo)2}, (43a) \nyo( T) = ( So\/ Eo){exp( (1 - So\/ Eo) T\/ (1 + K)) - 1}\/{exp((1 - So\/ Eo) T\/ (1 + K) \n(43b) - So\/Eo)}, \nfor So\/Eo \u2022 1, while \nxo(T) = 1\/{(T\/(1 + K)+ 1) 2} (44a) \nyo(T) = T\/{(1 + K)+ T} (44b) \nfor So\/Eo = 1. As before, the zeroth order composite solutions for s, x, and y may \nbe constructed by adding the pre-steady state and steady state solutions and \nsubtracting the common parts. Note, in particular, that by matching (43b) and \n(30) and subtracting the common part, it follows that the zeroth order composite \nsolution for y is given by (43b). \n(m)  e = o(~) ,  i \/ ( i  +,~) = O(e)  \nIntroducing the e-independent similarity variables r1 and \/'2, we have \nO=rle, 1\/(l+K)=r2e. (45) \nSince K\/(1 + \u2022 ) = 1 - 1\/(1 + K) = 1 + O(e), the zeroth order problem for the steady \nstate given by (22a, b, c) and (313, b, c) is \ndso\/dT = Xo- So(1 - Yo) (46a) \n0 = So(1 - yo) - Xo (46b) \ndyo\/ dT = -rlYo. (46c) \n700 C .L .  Frenzen and P. K. Maini  \nThe arbitrary constants appearing in the solution of (46a, b, c) are determined \nby matching with the pre-steady state solution (24a, b, c), yielding \nso(T) = 1 (47a) \nxo(T) = 1 (47b) \nYo(T) = 0. (47c) \nThus the large size of K prevents ubstrate from being consumed. Equations \n(47a, b, c) follow formally from (35a, b, c) with 1\/(1 + K) = O(e), and suggest a \nlonger time scale ts(1 + K) for the steady state problem when K is very large. On \nthis timescale, the solution is \nSo = e -L  (47d) \nXo = e -L  (47e) \nYo = 0, (47f) \nwhere Ts = ts(1 + K). Note that this solution is the same as that for case (i). \n(\/v) 0 = o(e ) ,  ~ = o(1)  \nAgain we introduce the similarity variable r defined by 0 = re, r being independent \nof e. The zeroth order problem follows from (22a, b, c), (31a, b, c): \nClSo\/clT = [K\/(1 + ~)]Xo-So(1 -yo)  (48a) \n0 = So(1 -Yo) - Xo (48b) \ndyo\/ clT = [ So\/ ( Eo(1 + K))]Xo- ryo. (48c) \nargument indicates So ~> 0, Xo ~> 0 and Yo t> 0; from (48a) it A phase plane \nfollows that \nd\/dT[ln So] = - [1\/ (1 + K)](1 -Yo). (49) \nDifferentiating (49) again gives \nd2\/dT2[ln So] = [1\/(1+ K)](dyo\/dT) \n= [1\/(1 + K)](So\/(Eo(1 + K))Xo-- ryo]. (50) \nUsing (48a, b) then implies \nd2\/dr2[ln So] = -(So\/Eo(1 + K)) also~aT- r{(d\/dr In So) + 1\/(1 + K)}. (51) \nIntegrating (51) once, matching with the pre-steady state solution and letting \nS 0 = e F(T), F(0) -- 0 \nfinally gives \ndF\/dT+[So\/(Eo(l+K))]e~ +rF+(1\/(l+K))(rT+l-So\/Eo)=O.

Conclusion \nIn this paper we have extended the parameter domain for which the quasi-steady \nstate assumption may be applied to the reaction scheme \nkl k 2 k 3 \nE+S.  \"S ~ Y > E+P (R) \nk-  1 \nby using scaling arguments due to Segel and Slemrod [4]. Approximate solutions \nhave been obtained for certain cases in which the ratio of initial enzyme to \nsubstrate concentration is a fixed positive number. Our analytical approximations \ncompare favourably with numerical solutions of the full system. \nOur results and methods might be useful for biochemical reactions in vivo, \nwhere often the ratio of initial enzyme to substrate concentration is order one; \nprevious analytical work, valid only when the latter atio is small, is not applicable \nto such problems. The analysis here, however, remains valid when the rate \nconstants of the reaction and the initial substrate concentration satisfy a certain \ncondition and predicts the time variation of chemical concentrations in terms of \nthese rate constants. Open systems have added complications uch as variable \nreaction rates, diffusion of chemicals, etc. The results and procedures discussed \nin this paper are a first step towards dealing with the more general case. We have \nshown that the behaviour of the system depends on the values of the parameters. \nIn some parameter domains, s decreases exponentially, in others, it decreases \nas a rational function (Fig. 1). Thus, by looking at the qualitative behaviour \nof the chemical concentrations in an experiment, one may be able to determine \nthe parameter regime and thus fit the appropriate analytical approximation to \nthe data. This would be a quicker and more reliable method for finding reaction \nrates than simply fitting the full ordinary differential equation system to the data. \nConsequently these results may also be used to evaluate reaction rates in some \nexperiments. \nWe have shown that by decreasing the initial substrate concentration while \nkeeping the ratio of initial enzyme to substrate concentration fixed, one can move \ninto a parameter regime where the quasi-steady state assumption is valid. In this \nway perhaps one can modify experiments in order to apply the analytical results \nEnzyme kinetics for a two-step enzymic reaction 703 \nof Sect. 4. The ideas we have applied to reaction (R) can very likely be extended \nto other more complicated reaction schemes, such as (G). \nIn a future publication we shall combine the analytical results obtained here \ntogether with experimental data to estimate the rates of reaction in a scheme like \n(R). \nAcknowledgements.
