Introduction\nThe very complicated \u00aeow of both the atmosphere and oceans is believed to be\ndescribed accurately by the classical Navier{Stokes-based equations of \u00aeuid motion.\nHowever, in the asymptotic regimes (parametrized by rotation and strati\u00ad cation)\nthat are most relevant for weather and climate forecasting, it can be shown that the\nsolutions of the \u00aeuid equations stay close over \u00ad nite, but useful, time intervals to\nthe solutions of much simpler dynamical systems. These approximate models seek to\ndescribe \u00aeows in which there is a dominant balance between the Coriolis, buoyancy\nand pressure-gradient forces on \u00aeuid particles. Such approximations to Newton\u2019s\nsecond law are commonly referred to as balanced models, and the so-called quasi-\ngeostrophic and semi-geostrophic theories are examples of such models.\nSalmon (1983, 1985, 1988) pioneered the systematic derivation of balanced models\nwithin the framework of Hamilton\u2019s principle. The rationale is to make approxima-\ntions to the Lagrangian without disturbing the symmetry properties of the functional,\nthereby ensuring that the resulting model retains approximations to the conservation\nProc. R. Soc. Lond. A (2001) 457, 1519{1531\n1519\nc\u00ae 2001 Crown Copyright 2001\n1520 V. N. Roubtsov and I. Roulstone\nlaws of the Euler equations. In particular, the particle relabelling symmetry corre-\nsponds, within the model approximations, to the fundamental meteorological cum\noceanographic \u00aeuid-dynamical principle of conservation of `potential vorticity\u2019.\nThe semi-geostrophic model has a particular signi\u00ad cance in dynamical meteorol-\nogy. The reason is that semi-geostrophy has certain useful and elegant mathematical\nproperties, in particular Hamiltonian structure, Legendre duality, and the convexity\nof certain potential functions (Chynoweth & Sewell 1989, 1991; Roulstone & Norbury\n1994; Roulstone & Sewell 1997). These permit both robust numerical integration|\neven in cases where frontal discontinuities form|and a rather complete knowledge\nof mathematical properties, such as existence and uniqueness of solutions (Cullen\n& Purser 1984; Purser & Cullen 1987; Cullen et al . 1991). Subsequently, within a\nclass of balanced models described by McIntyre & Roulstone (1996), quaternionic\nand Kahler structure has been identi\u00ad ed. This structure is a consequence of the rela-\ntionship between the potential vorticity and a geopotential height function which is\ngoverned by a Monge{Amp\u00b3ere equation (Roubtsov & Roulstone 1997). In light of\nthis discovery, McIntyre & Roulstone (2001) address the issue of whether higher-\norder corrections to semi-geostrophy may be constructed while retaining some of the\nmathematical features that facilitate the integration of the equations both analyt-\nically and numerically. This issue is of practical importance given the diversity of\nbalanced models used to study the various regimes of geophysical \u00aeows (Allen et\nal . 1990; McWilliams & Gent 1980), and the need for e\u00af cient, accurate integration\nschemes for such models.\nIn the spirit of these recent developments, the purpose of this paper is to demon-\nstrate the existence of Kahler, special Lagrangian and special Kahler geometry (see\nxx 3, 4 a{c) in the models described by McIntyre & Roulstone (1996). In turn, this\nfacilitates the study of certain duality properties (see xx 4 c; d). Hitherto, duality has\nonly been studied within the context of the semi-geostrophic equations, which do not\npossess Kahler structure. We shall use the shallow-water equations as a paradigm for\nthe equations of meteorology and oceanography, because the absence of an explicit\nform of momentum balance in the vertical facilitates a clear exposition of the trans-\nformations of the horizontal components of the con\u00ad guration and velocity \u00ad elds.\n2. Shallow-water theory and balanced dynamics\nThe motion of a typical particle in shallow-water theory can be described by express-\ning the current Cartesian horizontal coordinates\nx = x(a; b; t); y = y(a; b; t) (2.1)\nas functions, on the right of (2.1), of the Lagrangian particle labels a, b and the time\nt. The incompressibility hypothesis requires the current depth, or height, h to be a\nfunction h(a; b; t) with the property\nh(a; b; 0)\nh(a; b; t)\n=\n@(x; y)\n@(a; b)\n; (2.2)\nwhere the Jacobian on the right-hand side is that of the mapping (2.1). The time\nderivative of (2.2) following a particle gives the di\u00acerential equation of continuity.\nThe equations of horizontal momentum balance for \u00aeows over a bed which is\nrotating with position-dependent Coriolis parameter f(y) (where the y-coordinate\nProc. R. Soc. Lond. A (2001)\nHolomorphic structures in hydrodynamical models 1521\ndenotes north) are\nx + g\n@h\n@x\n\u00a1 _yf = 0; y + g @h\n@y\n+ _xf = 0: (2.3)\nHere g is a given constant representing the combined e\u00acect of the acceleration due to\ngravity and a centrifugal component due to the Earth\u2019s rotation, and the superposed\ndot denotes the time derivative following a particle.\nAnother important kinematical concept is the so-called potential vorticity de\u00ad ned\nby\n\u00b9 =\n1\nh\n@ _y\n@x\n\u00a1 @ _x\n@y\n+ f ; (2.4)\nwhich is conserved on particles. Common choices of the Coriolis parameter are f =\nconst: or \u00ad y, as approximations to 2 \u00ab sin \u00bf , depending on purpose. Here \u00ad and \u00ab\nare constants (related to the spin of the Earth), and \u00bf is latitude. (Note, to avoid\nconfusion, that \u00ab will be used to denote a symplectic structure later in the paper.)\nThe semi-geostrophic approximation to equations (2.3), in the case when f is a\nconstant, is the replacement of the true acceleration by the time derivative of another\nvector,\nug = \u00a1 g\nf\n@h\n@y\n; vg =\ng\nf\n@h\n@x\n; (2.5)\nfollowing the particle. This vector is a notional velocity, called the geostrophic veloc-\nity. The semi-geostrophic approximation seeks to \u00ad nd motions satisfying\n_ug + g\n@h\n@x\n\u00a1 _yf = 0; _vg + g@h\n@y\n+ _xf = 0; (2.6)\ntogether with the continuity equation obtained from (2.2). Associated with these\nequations, the potential vorticity\n\u00a5 =\n1\nh\nf +\n@vg\n@x\n\u00a1 @ug\n@y\n+\n1\nf\n@(ug; vg)\n@(x; y)\n; (2.7)\nis conserved.\nFollowing Hoskins (1975) we introduce a transformation of coordinates:\nX = x +\ng\nf2\n@h\n@x\n; Y = y +\ng\nf2\n@h\n@y\n: (2.8)\nFor a thorough discussion of this transformation, including its Legendre and con-\ntact properties, see Roulstone & Sewell (1997). The coordinates (X; Y ) are called\ngeostrophic coordinates, because, when f is a constant, _X = ug, _Y = vg. Moti-\nvated by the issue of the dependence of the Coriolis parameter, f , on latitude,\nSalmon (1985) studied certain generalized semi-geostrophic equations with pseudo-\nHamiltonian form in (X; Y )-space, namely\n_X = \u00a1 1\nf(X; Y )\n@\u00aa\n@Y\n; _Y =\n1\nf(X; Y )\n@\u00aa\n@X\n; (2.9)\nwhere\n\u00aa (X; Y; t) = 1\n2\n(u2g + v\n2\ng) + gh: (2.10)\nProc. R. Soc. Lond. A (2001)\n1522 V. N. Roubtsov and I. Roulstone\nThe results of Salmon (1985) are also of interest when f is independent of position\n(in which case (2.9) can easily be written in canonical form) and henceforth, in this\npaper, we consider f to be a given constant. In the coordinates (2.8) the potential\nvorticity takes the Jacobian form (noting (2.5)):\n\u00a5 =\nf\nh\n@(X; Y )\n@(x; y)\n=\n1\nh\nf +\n@vg\n@x\n\u00a1 @ug\n@y\n+\n1\nf\n@(ug ; vg)\n@(x; y)\n: (2.11)\nThe de\u00ad nition (2.11) can be rewritten as\n\u00a5 =\ngf\n(H \u00a1 1\n2\nf(x2 + y2))\n@2H\n@x2\n@2H\n@x@y\n@2H\n@y@x\n@2H\n@y2\n; (2.12)\nwhere H = 1\n2\nf(x2 + y2)+ gh. This is the starting point for a Monge{Amp\u00b3ere type of\nequation in which H(x; y; t) is the unknown, to be found in conjunction with suitable\nboundary conditions. Roubtsov & Roulstone (1997) show how the Monge{Amp\u00b3ere\nequation (2.12) can be expressed in terms of a 2-form restricted to the graph of h.\nMcIntyre & Roulstone (1996) studied a family of balanced models, all of which pos-\nsess a `Monge{Amp\u00b3ere\/stream function\u2019 relationship, like the semi-geostrophic equa-\ntions above, between the potential vorticity and the depth h. These balanced models\nare termed `near-local\u2019 because they can be derived using the framework of con-\nstrained Hamiltonian systems (Salmon 1988; McIntyre & Roulstone 1996) in which\nthe constraints depend on the local value of the depth function and a \u00ad nite number of\nits derivatives with respect to x and y. No non-local constraints are involved. Canon-\nical coordinates, which should be considered as analogues of (2.8), were discovered\ntogether with an associated complex structure, and this was formulated in terms of\nquaternions by Roubtsov & Roulstone (1997).\n3. Complex and Kahler structures\nFollowing McIntyre & Roulstone (1996), Roubtsov & Roulstone (1997) introduce the\nfollowing notation for canonical coordinates for near-local balanced models\nX = x + icq + ap; Y = y \u00a1 icp + aq; (3.1)\nwhere a; c 2 , i = p\u00a1 1 and (p; q) = (g@h=@x; g@h=@y). This particular choice\n(noting the presence of the minus sign in the de\u00ad nition of Y ) was motivated by\nthe fact that McIntyre & Roulstone (1996) showed that the materially conserved\npotential vorticity, \u00a5 , can always be expressed in Jacobian form (cf. (2.11) and\n(2.12)):\n\u00a5 =\nf\nh\n@(X; Y )\n@(x; y)\n: (3.2)\nThe parameters a and c determine the form of the potential vorticity (and vice\nversa) and the choice is \u00ad xed by the balanced model under consideration. However,\nwe shall \u00ad nd (x 4 b) that the expression for the coordinates (3.1) is subject to certain\nrestrictions if particular complex structures are required.\nProc. R. Soc. Lond. A (2001)\nHolomorphic structures in hydrodynamical models 1523\nAnother reason for making the choice (3.1) concerns the relationship between this\nset of coordinates and those de\u00ad ned in (2.8). In particular, if we de\u00ad ne z^ = x + icq,\nw^ = y \u00a1 icp on a two-dimensional complex manifold, then there exists a hyper-Kahler\ntriple of 2-forms\n!^I = Re(dz^ ^ dw^) = dx ^ dy \u00a1 c2dp ^ dq; (3.3)\n!^J =\n1\n2\ni(dz^ ^ d\u00b7^z + dw^ ^ d \u00b7^w) = c(dx ^ dq + dp ^ dy); (3.4)\n!^K = Im(dz^ ^ dw^) = \u00a1 c(dx ^ dp + dy ^ dq) = \u00a1 c\u00ab ; (3.5)\nwhere \u00ab is the canonical 2-form. The \u00ad rst two 2-forms, (3.3) and (3.4), represent\nLegendre-conjugate elliptic Monge{Amp\u00b3ere operators (see Lychagin et al . (1993) for\nthe general theory). The transformation (z^; w^) 7! (X; Y ), implicit in (3.1), has the\nfollowing action on the hyper-Kahler triple (i.e. dz^ ^ dw^ 7! dX ^ dY , etc.):\n!^I 7! dx ^ dy + a(dx ^ dq + dp ^ dy) + (a2 \u00a1 c2) dp ^ dq; (3.6)\n!^J 7! c(dx ^ dq + dp ^ dy) + 2ac dp ^ dq; (3.7)\n!^K 7! !^K (= \u00a1 c\u00ab ): (3.8)\nOnce again, the \u00ad rst two 2-forms represent elliptic Monge{Amp\u00b3ere operators, i.e. the\ntransformation (3.1) preserves the ellipticity, and for the choice a = 1=f 2, c = 0\nwe recover (2.8), and the equations that follow, from (3.1). The elliptic operators\ndiscussed by McIntyre & Roulstone (1996) correspond to di\u00acerent choices of a and\nc in (3.6).\nIt is convenient for the purposes of this paper to introduce a new notation. De\u00ad ne\nZ \u00b2 x + icq + ap (= X);\nW \u00b2 y + icp + aq (= \u00b7Y ); (3.9)\nand we shall show (see (3.14) and those that follow) that there exists a Kahler struc-\nture in this representation. The salient point is that we wish to place the emphasis\non the complex structure rather than on the Jacobian relationship (3.2) between the\npotential vorticity, \u00a5 , and the `geostrophic coordinates\u2019 (X; Y ).\nFrom (3.9), one can readily show that\n@(Z; \u00b7Z;W; \u00b7W )\n@(x; y; p; q)\n= \u00a1 4c2; (3.10)\nand we \u00ad nd\np =\ni\n2c\n( \u00b7W \u00a1 W ); q = \u00a1 i\n2c\n(Z \u00a1 \u00b7Z); (3.11)\nx = 1\n2\n(Z + \u00b7Z) \u00a1 ia\n2c\n( \u00b7W \u00a1 W ); y = 1\n2\n(W + \u00b7W ) +\nia\n2c\n(Z \u00a1 \u00b7Z): (3.12)\nIt follows that\n@\n@Z\n=\n1\n2\n@\n@x\n+\nia\nc\n@\n@y\n\u00a1 i\nc\n@\n@q\n;\n@\n@W\n=\n1\n2\n@\n@y\n+\nia\nc\n@\n@x\n\u00a1 i\nc\n@\n@p\n: (3.13)\nThe canonical structure in the coordinates (Z;W ) is evidently a (1,1)-form,\n\u00ab =\ni\n2c\n(dZ ^ d \u00b7W + dW ^ d \u00b7Z) = dx ^ dp + dy ^ dq; (3.14)\nProc.

A second argument (see x 4 b) for adopting the\ncoordinates (Z;W ) is that they can be considered as an example of special Lagrangian\ncoordinates on an `initial\u2019 phase space spanned by a set of coordinates (z; w),\nz \u00b2 x + icq; w \u00b2 y + icp; (3.15)\nwith deformed complex structure\n(z; w) 7! (Z;W ); (3.16)\nin accordance with the prescriptions for their existence given by Hitchin (1997) (see\nalso Gross 1999). The `momentum\u2019 part of the transformation (p; q) 7! (P ;Q),\nP \u00b2 ap + icq; Q \u00b2 icp + aq; (3.17)\nhas a diagonal real part and symmetric imaginary part, and hence the coordinates\n(Z;W ) obey, trivially, the prescriptions to be special Lagrangian. We recall that this\nproperty means that there is an integrable almost-complex structure on the phase\nspace of the model, which induces a \u00aeat metric such that the cotangent components\nP , Q (which are evidently Lagrangian) are also of `minimal volume\u2019 with respect\nto this metric. These conditions are discussed in detail in theorem 5.2 in Gross\n(1999). This observation shows that the phase space of the near-local balanced models\nwith the coordinates (Z;W ) can be considered as a Lagrangian \u00ad bration over the\nbase manifold with local coordinates (x; y). The Ricci-\u00aeat condition, under which\nthe notion `special Lagrangian\u2019 is de\u00ad ned, corresponds, for example, to the Monge{\nAmp\u00b3ere equation (3.2) with \u00a5 h = 1 (cf. (3.6) recalling that a; c 2 ). We shall return\nto this point in x 4 c.\nThe holomorphic (2,0)-form dZ ^ dW is expressed in the original coordinates as\ndZ ^ dW = (dz + a dp) ^ (dw + a dq)\n= dx ^ dy + a(dx ^ dq + dp ^ dy)\n+ ic(dx ^ dp + dq ^ dy) + (a2 + c2) dp ^ dq: (3.18)\nWe will see below that this is essentially the only possible choice of complex structure\nonce we \u00ad x the elliptic Monge{Amp\u00b3ere operator for the balanced model. From the\nhyper-Kahler geometry point of view, the adoption of the de\u00ad nition (3.15) is nothing\nmore than choosing to work with the canonical \u00aeat hyper-Kahler structure on 2:\n!I = Re(dz ^ dw); (3.19)\n!J =\n1\n2\ni(dz ^ d\u00b7z + dw ^ d \u00b7w); (3.20)\n!K = Im(dz ^ dw): (3.21)\nBut we then \u00ad nd that under (3.16), which we represent as ! 7! ~!, we have\n~!I = dx ^ dy + a(dx ^ dq + dp ^ dy) + (a2 + c2) dp ^ dq; (3.22)\n~!J = c(dx ^ dq \u00a1 dp ^ dy) (= !J ); (3.23)\n~!K = c(dx ^ dp + dq ^ dy); (3.24)\nand now the triple represent hyperbolic Monge{Amp\u00b3ere operators. So we have lost\nellipticity, a feature which is crucial to the physical application in mind. We establish\nthe connection between elliptic operators, the choice of coordinates on 2, and the\nspecial Kahler structure, in x 4 c.\nProc. R. Soc. Lond.

Then, using a conformal rescaling\nby the Pfa\u00af an, we can suppose that, up to a symplectomorphism of 4, either \u00af or\n\u00b0 can be chosen to be equal to 1. It is then easy to see, from (4.6), that in the choice\nwe have for the coordinates ~Z; ~W , after imposing ellipticity and the conformal choice\nof \u00b0 = 1, there remain only two degrees of freedom: the dependences on \u00af and \u00ac (or\non \u00af and \u00ae ).\n(c) Conformal structure, pseudometric and special Kahler structure\nGiven a pair of 2-forms (!; \u00ab ) on T \u00a4 M, such that ! ^ \u00ab = 0, then, \u00ad xing the\nvolume form in terms of \u00ab , we can de\u00ad ne a conformal pseudo-Riemannian structure\non T \u00a4 M such that if the volume of M is vol2, then we have a quadratic form\ng!(U;V ) =\n({U \u00ab ^ {V ! + {V \u00ab ^ {U!)\n\u00ab ^ \u00ab ^ \u00ba\n\u00a4 (vol2); (4.11)\nwhere U;V 2 T (T \u00a4 M) and \u00ba : T \u00a4 M 7!

Summary\nThese results are a contribution to the ongoing research into balanced models in\ngeophysical \u00aeuid dynamics, in which the objective is to understand the properties of\nthe equations that assist solution strategies. The relationships between the ellipticity\nof the operators, the Hamiltonian structure of the evolution equations and the sta-\nbility of \u00aeows described by such balanced models are subtle and our understanding\nof these issues is far from complete. This paper demonstrates how geometry can o\u00acer\ninsights into some of these problems. For example, the Kahler structure associated\nwith a Monge{Amp\u00b3ere equation facilitates an understanding of\n(i) why complex coordinates arise in a natural way in these models, something\nthat would be di\u00af cult to deduce from the physics alone, and\n(ii) how the elliptic and hyperbolic operators are related under duality.\nWe have shown that a natural generalization (3.1) of the so-called geostrophic\nmomentum transformation (2.8) of semi-geostrophic theory, discovered by McIntyre\n& Roulstone (1996), possesses a special Lagrangian and special Kahler structure.\nThe conditions under which these properties exist (a Monge{Amp\u00b3ere equation with\nconstant coe\u00af cients) may appear a little restrictive from the point of view of the\nhydrodynamics, but the identi\u00ad cation of these geometries has, in turn, facilitated\nan approach to studying the duality structure of the models as described in x 4 c\nand x 4 d. A study with less restrictive integrability conditions is in progress. The\nduality properties of semi-geostrophic theory have been studied extensively elsewhere\n(see, for example, Roulstone & Sewell (1997) and references cited therein), and such\nfeatures are of practical importance too, noting both the utility of balanced dynamics\nin understanding mid-latitude weather systems and the attempts to improve the\nrepresentation of such weather systems in numerical models via, for example, the\nuse of adaptive techniques in data-assimilation schemes (see, for example, Desroziers\n1997).\nThe authors are grateful to Professors N.
