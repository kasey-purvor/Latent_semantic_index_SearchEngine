Prevention of healthcare-associated\ninfections is currently a major concern for the\nNational Health Service. Thus, the rate, appropri-\nateness and technique of prehospital cannulation\nhave become an important issue.\nCannulation is undertaken for a range of\nreasons, including administration of IV medica-\ntion, analgesia or fluids; to take blood samples; or\nas a precaution against being unable to place an IV\nline at a later stage. Paramedics are trained to\nconsider various factors in deciding whether to\nplace an IV cannula, including mechanism of\ninjury or chief medical complaint, medical history,\nage, vital signs, and time and distance to hospital.1\nPractitioners trained to paramedic level and beyond\nare increasingly being used by services to provide\nfront-line care, and, possibly linked to this increase\nin trained paramedics, there is a perception that\nthe numbers of patients cannulated in the pre-\nhospital setting has increased over the years.\nHowever, the use of this technique varies widely\nbetween paramedics or ambulance sites, even\nwhen the condition of the patient is similar.2\nAlthough cannulation can provide necessary and\nclinically important vascular access, inappropriate\nuse may cause unnecessary pain and distress and,\nin some cases, put patients at risk for phlebitis,\ncatheter-related obstruction and infection.3\nCannulation may also delay transport to hospital4\nby 1\u20132 minutes and poses a small risk of needle\nstick injury to paramedics. Although increased risk\nof infection or phlebitis has not been demonstrated\nfor prehospital cannulation in recent studies,5 6 it\nwas associated with emergency department com-\npared with in-hospital cannulation insertion in one\nstudy.7 Thus, the appropriateness of cannulation\nhas become an important issue as its use has\nbecome widespread.\nA study of out-of-hospital IV cannulation by the\nLondon Ambulance Service in 2000 found that 4%\nof all patients (24 000 patients a year) were\ncannulated.2 In a sample of these cases from 1995\nto 1996, 17% of IV placements were judged by a\nspecialist review panel to have been inappropriate,\nand wide variations in rates of IV placement\nbetween individual paramedics were found to\nexist.1\nIn an analysis of 8866 patients transported to the\nED by ambulance in the Lincolnshire Division of\nEast Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) in\nSeptember 2006, paramedics cannulated 14.2% of\npatients transported by emergency ambulance.\nCannulation rates varied considerably by ambu-\nlance station, with a mean rate of 13.4% (range\n5.8% to 19.0%).8 To assess whether cannulation\nwas performed appropriately, clinical conditions\nwere classified at the outset according to whether\nthey warranted cannulation, did not warrant\ncannulation, or there was uncertainty as to the\nneed for cannulation. Other conditions for appro-\npriate cannulation, such as IV drug administration,\nconsciousness level (Glasgow Coma Scale score\n,8), systolic blood pressure (,90 mm Hg), respira-\ntory rate (,10 breaths per minute) and haemor-\nrhage, were combined with clinical indication to\ndetermine whether cannulation was indicated.\nCriteria of appropriateness and method of analysis\nPrehospital care\nEmerg Med J 2009;26:831\u2013836. doi:10.1136\/emj.2008.071415 831\n on 22 October 2009 emj.bmj.comDownloaded from \nwere agreed upon at the outset and based on the previous study\nby London Ambulance Service.9 Other variables including\npatient age, sex, hypoglycaemia and ambulance station were\ninvestigated as predictors of variation in rates of cannulation. It\nwas estimated that 15.6% of cannulations could potentially\nhave been avoided. Intravenous drug or fluid administration\nwas the strongest predictor of cannulation.\nLiterature concerning prehospital cannulation is scarce, with\nvery few published studies. In hospital settings, system changes\nsuch as the introduction of specially trained IV teams have been\nshown to reduce rates of infection and inflammation associated\nwith peripheral cannulae.10\nThe aim of this evaluation was to investigate the effect of an\neducational intervention designed to increase appropriateness\nand technique of prehospital cannulation by paramedics.\nMETHODS\nEvaluation design\nWe used a non-randomised control group (before and after)\ndesign for the evaluation (fig 1).11 12 The primary hypothesis was\nthat after an educational intervention carried out to improve\nthe appropriateness and technique of cannulation, there would\nbe an increase in appropriate cannulation and an improvement\nin observed cannulation technique. The primary outcome was\nthe rate of appropriate cannulation. This was operationalised as\nthe rate of cannulation, where drugs or IV fluids were recorded\nas having been given, using data from routine clinical records.\nSecondary outcomes included overall cannulation rate (from\nroutine clinical records) and observed cannulation technique\n(see below). The outcomes were measured from at least\n2 months before and 2 months after the intervention took\nplace to allow time for the education delivered to the paramedic\nteam leaders (PTLs) to be cascaded to paramedics in their teams\nand for change in practice to occur.\nSetting\nEMAS NHS Trust provides emergency unscheduled care and\npatient transport services for the six counties of Derbyshire,\nLeicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire\nand Rutland. EMAS delivers its service through 3000 staff at .70\nlocations, with two control rooms at Nottingham and Lincoln,\nand by responding to over 500 000 emergency calls every year.\nParticipants\nTwo geographical areas of EMAS were involved in the\nevaluation, with Nottinghamshire as the intervention site and\nLincolnshire as the comparison site. All paramedics in these\nareas, 80 in Nottinghamshire and 243 in Lincolnshire, were\ninvolved in the evaluation.\nIntervention\nThe educational intervention was based on national Joint Royal\nColleges Ambulance Liaison Committee 13 guidance and was\ndelivered by clinical educators to PTLs. It was planned that the\neducational intervention would initially be delivered to PTLs in\nthe intervention site (Nottinghamshire), who would subse-\nquently cascade this to paramedics in their teams within a 2-\nweek period. If the study proved the intervention to be\nsuccessful, a similar intervention was planned for delivery in\nother sites of EMAS.\nThe educational intervention in Nottinghamshire was con-\nducted by a paramedic educator, who delivered the training as a\nlocal workshop to all PTLs between 21 February and 11 March\n2008. To deliver the intervention, the tutor attended all PTL\nFigure 1 Study flow diagram.\nPrehospital care\n832 Emerg Med J 2009;26:831\u2013836. doi:10.1136\/emj.2008.071415\n on 22 October 2009 emj.bmj.comDownloaded from \nmeetings, which often took place in the evenings. The PTLs\nthen cascaded the education to paramedics within their own\nteam over the next 2 weeks.\nThe educational intervention\/workshop was designed to\naddress the following learning outcomes:\nc to increase appropriate and reduce unnecessary cannulation;\nthat is, a cannula should be inserted only if\n\u2013 the patient needs fluid replacement,\n\u2013 the patient needs IV medication,\n\u2013 the patient\u2019s condition requires it;\nc to improve cannulation technique, with particular attention\nto prevention of sepsis;\nc to cascade education to paramedics10\u201312 within their team.\nA PowerPoint presentation was issued to each PTL, followed\nup with an electronic copy by email, to support educational\ndelivery to their teams. Each PTL was issued with a pack\ncontaining the following: attendance register; presentation\nhandout; IV cannulation guidance; no-touch procedure for IV\ncannulation and guidance on aseptic technique, hand hygiene\nprocedure and gloves use; and an observation of cannulation\nchecklist. An evaluation questionnaire was distributed to\nparticipants immediately after the training to assist in evaluat-\ning the effectiveness of the workshop.\nSample size estimations\nA previous audit showed that in 1 month, paramedics\ncannulated 14.6% of patients. Sample size calculation with a\ntwo-sided 5% significance level and 95% power showed that to\ndetect an odds ratio of 0.63 (risk ratio 0.67) in the intervention\ngroup (ie, a reduction in overall cannulation rate from 15% to\n10%), 1450 patients would be needed (725 cases and 725\ncontrols).\nA pragmatic approach was taken for the observation exercise\nto assess cannulation technique in the intervention and control\nsites. In both sites, 50 paramedics were selected from staff\ndelivering patients to A&E departments and\/or from ambulance\nstation sites during shift change over.\nData collection\nThe evaluation used routinely collected data from EMAS clinical\nrecords or patient report forms. All patient report forms for a\nperiod of 1 month were selected, 2 months before (February\n2008) and 2 months after (June 2008) the educational interven-\ntion. Data were extracted for analysis on whether the patient\nwas cannulated and whether IV drugs or fluids were adminis-\ntered. \u2018\u2018Inappropriate cannulation\u2019\u2019 was defined as cannulation\nwhen no IV drugs or fluids were recorded as having been\nadministered.\nObservation of cannulation technique\nFifty paramedics in the intervention and comparison areas were\nobserved by education specialists cannulating a \u2018\u2018model\u2019\u2019 arm in\nan ambulance at ED sites or at the station. A checklist was used\nto assess cannulation\/aseptic technique, which included ques-\ntions on indications for cannulation and observations on\ncannulation technique performed on the model arm, including\nprecannulation preparation, aseptic technique, cannulation site\nselection, insertion technique and procedure for finishing up.\nA memo from the operation manager was circulated to all\nparamedics and other front-line staff to assist and encourage\nprospective participants. This also assured staff that those who\nparticipated would not be identified in reports.\nData were verified on receipt of data collection forms\/\nchecklist and questionnaires. All analyses were performed with\nSPSS V.14.14\nThe evaluation did not involve any additional or non-\nstandard treatment of patients. The intervention emphasised\nthat patients who needed cannulation were not denied this\nintervention. All data from clinical records, questionnaires and\nobservation were anonymised. The study was approved as an\nevaluation by Lincolnshire Health and Social Care Steering\nGroup.\nRESULTS\nData were analysed using logistic regression to test for both\nmain and interaction effects between predictor variables. The\nfirst regression model included site (intervention vs control),\ntiming of testing (pre-intervention vs post-intervention) and\ninteraction between site and timing of testing as predictor\nvariables and overall cannulation rates as the outcome variable.\nThe second regression model included site (intervention vs\ncontrol), timing of testing (pre-intervention vs post-interven-\ntion) and interaction between site and timing of testing as\npredictor variables and inappropriate cannulation rates as the\noutcome variable.\nInappropriate cannulation\nThere was a reduction in inappropriate (no IV fluids or drugs\ngiven) cannulation rates in the intervention area (1.0% to 0%)\ncompared with the control area (2.5% to 2.6%). Logistic\nregression of the final model for inappropriate cannulation\nshowed that site (eB = 0.00, B = 15.78, SE B = 1467.74, p = 0.99),\ntiming of testing (eB = 0.00, B = 33.30, SE B = 2935.48, p = 0.99)\nand interaction between site and timing of testing (eB = 0.00,\nB =20.67, SE B = 58.71, p = 0.99) were not significant in\npredicting inappropriate cannulation (table 1).\nOverall cannulation rate\nThe results of the logistic regression revealed that the model for\noverall cannulation rate was significant (p,0.001). The final\nmodel revealed that site (eB = 0.54, B = 0.27, SE B = 0.36,\np = 0.46) was not a significant variable, but timing of testing\n(before or after intervention; eB = 11.73, B = 1.88, SE B = 0.55,\np,0.001) and interaction between site and timing of testing\n(eB = 10.15, B =20.03, SE B = 0.01, p,0.001) were significant\nvariables predicting overall cannulation rates (table 1).\nThere were higher overall cannulation rates at the post-\nintervention stage as compared with the pre-intervention stage.\nAdditionally, follow-up logistic regression analyses were per-\nformed for the intervention and control groups separately to\nexamine interaction effects. Results revealed that for the control\ngroup, at post-test, the log odds of being cannulated increased\nby a factor of 1.47 (table 2). However, for the intervention\ngroup, at post-test, the log odds of being cannulated decreased\nby a factor of 0.70 (table 2).\nObservation of cannulation technique\nParamedics in both intervention and control areas were\ncorrectly able to identify indications for cannulation (table 3).\nClinicians in the intervention area were significantly less likely\nto cite \u2018\u2018because the admitting staff expect it\u2019\u2019 as an indication\n(5.9% vs 32.0%). However, paramedics in the intervention area\nwere more likely to cite \u2018\u2018on the way to hospital to save time\u2019\u2019\n(76.5% vs. 34.0%) as an indication for cannulation. Paramedics\nin the intervention area were significantly more likely to clean\nPrehospital care\nEmerg Med J 2009;26:831\u2013836. doi:10.1136\/emj.2008.071415 833\n on 22 October 2009 emj.bmj.comDownloaded from \ntheir hands (74.5% vs 14.9%) before cannulation (table 4).\nHowever, they were also more likely to repalpate the vein\nwithout due attention to aseptic technique (70.6% vs 96.0%).\nDISCUSSION\nAn educational intervention provided to clinical team leaders\nresulted in a non-significant reduction in inappropriate cannu-\nlation rates. The intervention did lead to a reduction in overall\ncannulation rates, and there was evidence of better aseptic\ntechnique in the intervention area post-intervention. Some\nelements of knowledge about indications and technique were\nworse in the intervention area. PTLs had some effect as a means\nof cascading key education and training in a geographically\ndispersed health area.\nThis was a quasi-experimental study with potential biases\nfrom the non-equivalent group design.11 These included selec-\ntion bias from non-random selection of intervention and control\ngroups or areas and confounding from possible other external\ninfluences on outcomes occurring between the pre-intervention\nand post-intervention phases and possible existing differences\nbetween areas in cannulation technique. Biases such as\nregression to the mean would be less likely, given that the\nbaseline rate of cannulation was greater in the control than the\nintervention area and baseline differences in cannulation rates\nwere adjusted for in the analysis. We were unable to account for\ndifferences in secular trends in the intervention or control areas\nin the analysis. Measurement of outcomes was unchanged and\nconsistent before and after the intervention. The post-interven-\ntion assessment was not blinded, which was another potential\nsource of bias.\nOther investigators have used non-randomised designs in\nprehospital settings in studies of prehospital cardiac arrest.15 16\nSimilar designs have been used in primary care, particularly in\nquality improvement programmes or where it is technically\ndifficult, inappropriate or unethical to randomise patients.17\u201320\nAlthough cannulation rates were higher at baseline in\nLincolnshire8 compared with previously published rates in\nLondon,2 other prospective studies\u2014for example, in Scotland,\nhave shown a gradual reduction in cannulation rates over time.21\nChanges in rates of cannulation are likely to be affected by\nchanging evidence and consensus on use of drugs and fluids in\nprehospital settings, whether for trauma or medical emergencies.22\nRates of inappropriate cannulation were reduced in the inter-\nvention area, but this reduction was not statistically significant.\nTable 1 Summary of logistic regression analysis for variables predicting overall cannulation rates and\ninappropriate cannulation\nPredictor variable B SE B eB Exp(B)\n95% CI for exp(B)\nLower Upper\nInappropriate cannulation\nrate\nSite 15.78 1467.74 0.00 7096427 0.00\nTiming of testing 33.30 2935.48 0.00 3E+014 0.00\nSite6timing of testing 20.67 58.71 0.00 0.51 0.00 4.8E+049\nConstant 23.63 0.48 57.53** 0.03\nx2 34.03**\ndf 3\nOverall cannulation rate\nSite 0.27 0.36 0.54 1.31 0.64 2.66\nTiming of testing 1.88 0.55 11.73** 6.52 2.23 19.05\nSite6timing of testing 20.03 0.01 10.15** 0.97 0.95 0.99\nConstant 22.22 0.21 108.20 0.11\nx2 73.19**\ndf 3\nSite coded as 0 for control and 1 for intervention;

A previous study by Snooks et al2\nalso found low rates of inappropriate cannulation when this\nwas determined by clinical consensus. However, rates of\ninappropriate cannulation were higher in this previous study\nand there was poor inter-rater reliability of what constituted\ninappropriate cannulation, hence our rather narrower and\narguably more reliable definition, that is, inappropriate\ncannulation was that associated with no IV administration\nof drugs or fluids.\nImportantly, paramedic (clinical) team leaders were used as\nthe conduit for spreading quality improvement,23 and this\nmethod was considered to be particularly appropriate for\ndiffusion in our geographically dispersed and large organisation.\nThis study demonstrates the potential for education that is\ncascaded through PTLs to improve aspects of clinical care in the\nprehospital setting. Future studies could use more robust\nevaluations using rigorous techniques for reinforcement of\nexisting guidance or implementation of new health technologies\nin prehospital settings.\nAcknowledgements: We would like to acknowledge the support of paramedics who\ncompleted the questionnaire and the managers who supported the study.
