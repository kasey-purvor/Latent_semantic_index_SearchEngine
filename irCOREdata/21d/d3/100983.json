We also report preliminary measurements made on\nlaser diodes fabricated from companion wafers and the ma-\nterials parameters and theoretical model used to describe the\nPL results will be later applied to fully understand the prop-\nerties of these lasers.\nSamples were grown by MBE onto semi-insulating\nGaAs substrates at QinetiQ Malvern.

For each strain iteration,\ntwo additional structures were grown at the same time: a\nstructure consisting of the bottom AlxIn1\u2212xSb cladding and\nAlpGaqIn1\u2212p-qSb barrier only and a complete laser structure6\ncontaining two QWs.

This assumption is consistent with the sharpness of\nthe peaks observed in the rocking curve. The composition of\neach PL sample is summarized in Table I. In the PL experi-\nment, an Ar+ ion laser \u0001514 nm\u0002 was used to excite the\nsamples with a maximum excitation power density at the\nsample of 2 W \/cm2. The sample temperature was varied\nbetween 4 and 300 K using a continuous flow He cryostat\nsystem. The resulting PL emission was dispersed with a 0.3\nm grating monochromator and detected using a 77 K InSb\nphotodiode and a conventional lock-in amplifier. The mono-\nchromator resolution was typically 2 nm.\nFigure 2 shows the PL intensity measured at 12 K for\neach of the four samples. The maximum in PL intensity was\nestimated to occur at 364, 373, 383, and 396 meV for\nsamples A, B, C, and D, respectively. The corresponding\nenergies at which the maximum PL intensity was obtained is\nplotted as a function of the QW strain in the inset of Fig. 2,\nand these energies show a monotonic dependence on the QW\nstrain. An eight band k \u00b7 p model was used to calculate the\nenergy levels within the QW with strain taken into account8\nand material parameters taken from Ref. 9 giving values of\nthe E1-H1 transition as 352, 378, 383, and 403 meV for\nsamples A, B, C, and D, respectively, in close agreement to\nthe measured values, as summarized in Table I.\nThe full width at half maximum \u0001FWHM\u0002 of the PL\nsignal at 12 K was estimated to be \u000314, 31, 18, and 38 meV\nfor samples A, B, C, and D. These values are of the same\norder as those obtained, for example, from GaInAsSb\u2013\nAlGaAsSb samples grown on GaSb,10 indicating that growth\nof high quality AlGaInSb\/GaInSb QWs is possible on lattice\nmismatched GaAs substrates, offering potential advantages\nin terms of cost and integration. However, the surface mor-\nphology of sample D was not as good as that of the other\nsamples, as the growth process is not yet fully optimized for\nthe highest Al compositions. This may explain the relatively\nlarge FWHM obtained from this sample \u0001the reason for the\nrelatively high FWHM obtained for sample B is unclear at\nthis stage\u0002. The PL intensity was measured up to 180 K for\nall samples and the integrated PL intensity was observed to\ndecrease with increasing temperature for all samples. The PL\nsignal from sample C was measured up to room temperature,\nand in Fig. 3 the temperature dependence of the integrated\nPL intensity is plotted as a function of temperature. The inset\nis the Arrhenius plot of the same data. There appears to be a\nregime with an activation energy of \u000340 meV at high tem-\nperatures, and a regime at low temperatures where the acti-\nvation energy asymptotically approaches 0 meV. Similar be-\nhavior is observed in the other samples, and also in other\nmaterial systems, where the high temperature activation en-\nergy is thought to correspond to the thermally activated es-\ncape of carriers from the QW.11 However, in our case, this\nactivation energy is much smaller than the energy difference\nTABLE I.

However, as the\ntemperature increases, higher hole subbands could start to\nbecome populated. The value of activation energy extracted\nis consistent with the calculated energy separation of the\nlowest and first excited hole subbands. Since there is no clear\nevidence of transitions other than E1 to H1 in the measured\nspectra shown in Fig. 2, we assume that most of the PL\nsignal originates from this transition and that the other sub-\nbands are not populated under these pumping conditions.\nGreater population of the higher energy hole subbands could\nlead to a reduced PL signal in several ways. The reduced\npopulation of the lowest hole subband leads to reduced\nE1-H1 recombination, the optical strength of the transitions\nbetween E1 to excited hole subbands is weaker, and finally\nadditional nonradiative Auger processes become available.\nFurther modeling is underway to determine which of these\nmechanisms is dominant.\nIn Fig. 4, the integrated PL intensity \u0001for sample D\u0002 is\nplotted as a function of laser excitation power. The integrated\nPL intensity is plotted on a log-log scale, together with linear\nfits, showing that the integrated PL intensity IPL is related to\nthe excitation intensity Iex by IPL\u0003 Iex\u0004 , where \u0004 is given by\nthe slope of linear fits shown in the inset, as predicted\nfrom analysis of the appropriate rate equations.12 In this\ncase, the value of \u0004 was found to be 1, 1.53, 1.69, and 1.61\nat 4, 80, 130, and 180 K, respectively, suggesting that at low\ntemperature the luminescence is dominated by exciton\nrecombination,12 and at high temperatures it is dominated by\na mixture of free carrier recombination and exciton recom-\nbination. Similar behavior was exhibited by the other\nsamples, with values of \u0004 at 4\/80 \u0005 for samples A, B, and C\nof 1.39\/1.89, 1.12\/1.69, and 1.19\/1.61, respectively.\nFinally, a number of laser diodes were fabricated from\neach of the full laser structures L1, L2, L3, and L4, the\ncomposition of which are summarized in Table II. Prelimi-\nnary measurements at 100 K have yielded average threshold\ncurrent densities of 650 A \/cm2, 220 A \/cm2, 484 A \/cm2,\nand 2.7 kA \/cm2, with lasing observed at wavelengths of\n3.41, 3.44, 3.23, and 2.96 \u0001m, respectively for L1, L2, L3,\nand L4. Clear threshold currents were observed in the mea-\nsured light-current characteristics up to temperatures of 161,\n208, 219, and 151 K for samples L1, L2, L3, and L4, respec-\ntively. As for the PL samples, the surface morphology of\nsample L4 was not as good as that of the other samples, and\nwork is underway to optimize the growth process to allow\nthe fabrication of lasers with higher strain. Recent room tem-\nperature lasing from GaSb based type 1 structures4 was\nachieved with 1.5% strain in the QWs, as compared to only\n\u00030.8% for sample L3, suggesting that there is scope for\nsignificant improvement to these lasers. Further experiments\nare underway to fully characterize these devices and full de-\ntails of the device processing and characterization and com-\nparison with theoretical modeling will appear elsewhere.13\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the PL characteris-\ntics of GaInSb\/AlGaInSb type I MQWs, grown onto GaAs,\nas a function of increasing strain. Luminescence was ob-\nserved for all samples, with room temperature luminescence\nobserved for the sample with only \u00030.9% strain in the QWs,\noffering the prospect of exploiting this material system to\nrealize room temperature laser diodes emitting in the impor-\ntant 3\u20134 \u0001m region. Analysis of the temperature depen-\ndence of the luminescence suggests that population of ex-\ncited QW hole subbands occurs at high temperature, leading\nto a reduction in the PL signal. Work is now underway to\nfully investigate the properties of laser diodes containing\nsimilar QWs in the active region.\nThis work was supported by the UK Technology Strat-\negy Board Technology Programme.
