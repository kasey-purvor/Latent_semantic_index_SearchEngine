International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 37(3\/4): 449-464. \n \n \nAbstract \nSince the 1970s, fitness has developed as a cultural field\u2014a network of producers, consumers, products \nand practices that focuses on the exercising body.  This article considers the textual aspect of the U.S. \nfitness field, drawing from a content analysis of several U.S. exercise manuals from the late 1970s to late \n1990s.  The content of exercise manuals sheds light on the broader tastes and attitudes of fitness consumers, \nwho are chiefly middle and new middle class men and women.  In particular, the article addresses three \nrecurrent themes or \u201elessons\u201f regarding the fitness consumer and his or her attitude towards the body: as an \nobject of consumption, as a source of calculable rewards, and as a motivational problem.   \n \nKey words \nBodies, Consumption, Cultural Field, Fitness, Lifestyles \n \n \n \nOur bodies are sources of concern.  The proclamations of health experts and our \nexperiences of exertion, aging and illness raise worries about how well\u2014and for how \nlong\u2014our bodies function.  At the same time, daily interactions with each other and with \nmedia images remind us that we are judged on the basis of our bodily appearances and \nperformances.  Over the past thirty years, these two bodily dilemmas\u2014of health and \nappearance\u2014have become id\u00e9es fixes in consumer culture, and for the middle classes in \nparticular (Baudrillard, 1998; Bourdieu, 1984; Crawford, 1984; Featherstone, 1987, 1991; \nLaberge & Sankoff, 1988; Shilling, 1993; Wynne, 1998).  This article considers the \ncontemporary boom in physical fitness activities and commodities, which has arisen at \nthe intersection of these dual concerns for health and appearance.  Part of the post 1960s \nexpansion of middle class leisure and \u201elifestyle\u201f consumption, fitness is a quintessential \nleisure field.  Whether the concern is with the inner or outer body (or, more likely, both), \nfitness is represented as providing the answer: exercise makes you feel good and look \ngood. \nThis research draws on the work of Pierre Bourdieu (1984, 1993) to analyze \nfitness as a cultural field\u2014a complex web of  sites, products and practices, producers and \nconsumers focused on the exercising body (cf. Boudieu & Wacquant, 1992: 97-98; \nFerguson, 1998: 601-02; Jarvie & Maguire, 1994: 193-94; Jenkins, 1992: 84-87; Laberge \n& Kay, 2002: 253-55).  The development of the fitness field has involved the \ninstitutionalization of specific social settings (particularly, the health club), a cadre of \nprofessional producers (such as personal trainers and aerobics instructors), a market of \naffluent and informed consumers who generate and regulate the production and \nconsumption of fitness, and a discourse that represents and constitutes fitness as an \n 2  \nesteemed mode of caring for the body.  In an overwhelmingly commercialized leisure \nfield, this discourse is strategically packaged and sold in exercise magazines and manuals \nin order to maximize consumers\u201f tastes for, and expenditures on, fitness.  However, the \nneed to sell fitness texts does not simply determine the content of the discourse; \nproducers must speak to and through the preferences of consumers.  The fitness discourse \narticulates a congruous relationship between the character of fitness activities and the \ntastes and values of participants.  This article uses a discourse analysis of exercise texts to \nilluminate this reciprocity\u2014what Bourdieu terms \u201eelective affinities\u201f (1984: 241)\u2014\nbetween the logic of fitness production and the logic of taste that shapes fitness \nconsumption.  \nCentral to the cultural production of a field are networks of accreditation, \nauthority and prestige.  Such networks institutionalize a field\u201fs discourse, resources, body \nof knowledge and hierarchy of positions.  However, constructing such networks requires \nthat field participants\u2014both producers and consumers\u2014share stable channels through \nwhich they exchange views, debate practices, and confirm common assumptions.  In \nshort, a field requires a \u201esecond-order\u201f product of field-specific texts (Ferguson, 1998: \n600).  Through the mass dissemination of popular and professional writings, forms of \nexpertise, qualification and distinction are standardized and regulated (Ferguson, 1998: \n611).  Participation in the field can thus take the form of either immediate performance or \ntextual appreciation\u2014doing it, or reading about it.  Ideally, participation takes both \nforms, as the latter provides a reflexive and evaluative consciousness of the former. \nAs mechanisms of consumer education, fitness texts such as exercise manuals and \nmagazines broadcast the fitness field\u201fs practices and values to an audience that is defined \nby readership rather than exercise, presenting the opportunity for both vicarious, \nspectator fitness and the development of popular expertise in nutrition, physiology, and \nbiomechanics.  Fitness texts transcend the short-lived experience of working out, \ntransforming fitness from an immediate activity into a gradual course of instruction, and \nan intellectual, critical and aesthetic issue (Ferguson, 1998: 610).  Such lessons are \ncentral to the formation of critically-minded, informed consumers who self-consciously \nparticipate in fitness and carry out socially-visible activities of fitness consumption.   \nThe article proceeds with an overview of the growth of fitness publishing in the \nU.S. over the past thirty years before turning to the findings of a discourse analysis of \nexercise texts.  I examined a selection of health-education-oriented and consumer-\noriented U.S. exercise manuals from the late 1970s to late 1990s, comparing successive \neditions of the same manual and different manuals from both perspectives.\n2\n  In part, I was \ninterested in the differences (or the lack thereof) between texts that are more oriented \ntowards health education (such as the manuals of the American Heart Association, AHA, \nand the American College of Sports Medicine, ACSM) and those which are more \ncommercial (including the manuals published by lifestyle magazines, such as Self and \nMen\u2019s Health). Overall, the commonalities far outweighed the differences.  In particular, \nthe discussion focuses on three themes or \u201elessons\u201f that express the affinities between \nfitness producers and consumers.  These lessons recur over the years across different \nexercise texts regarding the promotion of particular attitudes towards the body: as a \nconsumer project, as a source of calculable rewards, and as a motivational problem. \n \n 3  \nThe Boom in Fitness Publishing \n \nSince the 1968 publication of Dr. Kenneth Cooper\u201fs Aerobics, fitness texts have become \nconsumer products in their own right.  Aerobics spent 28 weeks on The New York Times \nbestseller list (Justice, 1998) and Cooper followed it with several other bestsellers, \nincluding Aerobics for Women and The New Aerobics, which went through 30 printings \nduring the 1970s.  While not the first manual on exercise and its benefits, Cooper\u201fs 1968 \nbook marked the start of a wave of fitness publishing (Barbato, 1988: 20) that has \ncontinued since (Dahlin, 2001).  In an introduction to a later book, Cooper reflected: \nWhen I introduced aerobics as a new concept of exercise, my chief aim was to \ncounteract the problems of lethargy and inactivity which are so widely prevalent \nin our American population.  Therefore, my first book was mainly a motivational \nbook, but also it was an attempt to encourage people to examine more closely the \nbenefits to be gained from regular exercise.  (Cooper, 1970: 5) \nThe service role of fitness texts is thus made clear: in addition to information about the \nexercises themselves, the consumer requires education in the benefits of exercise, and in \nthe motivational strategies for adopting fitness as a regular lifestyle activity. \nThe production of advice about exercise and fitness has increased since the late \n1970s.  By 1979, when Self was launched as the first fitness magazine for women, \nfashion and women\u201fs serials such as Mademoiselle, Vogue and McCall\u2019s already had \nregular fitness and exercise columns.  Shape joined Self in the women\u201fs fitness magazine \ncategory in 1981, the same year that Jane Fonda published her Workout Book, the \nultimate exercise bestseller (Justice, 1998: 343).  Fonda\u201fs later books and exercise videos \nalso sold in the millions\u201423% of the 15 million exercise videos sold by 1987 were by \nFonda (Kagan & Morse, 1988: 165).  Other bestsellers in the late 1970s and early 80s \nincluded the running books of James Fixx and Dr. George Sheehan, men\u201fs workout \nbooks by Charles Hix, and Arnold Schwarzenegger\u201fs biography (Justice, 1998).  Popular \nmagazines also targeted men, with Men\u2019s Fitness and Men\u2019s Health both launched in \n1988.   \nThe rising discretionary incomes and niche marketing of the 1990s created the \nconditions for the further intensification of the production of lifestyle publishing and \nperiodicals.  According to the Magazine Publishers of America, between 1988 and 2000 \nthe number of magazine titles more than doubled, while the number of health and fitness \nmagazines nearly tripled.\n3\n  The four best-selling fitness magazines\u2014Men\u2019s Health, \nShape, Self, and Fitness\u2014each have paid circulations of more than a million readers.4  \nHundreds of health and fitness titles enter the publishing market each year.  In an article \nin the publishing trade journal, Publishers Weekly, the marketing opportunities of fitness \nare spelled out for authors and editors: \nConsumers have a ferocious appetite for advice telling them what to do, how to \nact, what to eat and what to shun in order to feel good, spruce up their health and \nshed uncomely pounds.  In fact, that hunger is so great that publishers scramble to \nsate it with books promising, if not the moon, at least a celestial body and mind.  \n(Dahlin, 2001: 24) \nOverall, the amount of press coverage devoted to physical fitness has increased more than \nsix-fold in the U.S. since the mid 1980s.\n5\n \n 4  \n Understanding the boom in fitness publishing entails identifying the primary \nfitness consumers.  Not surprisingly, consumers of exercise texts\u2014and fitness goods \nmore broadly\u2014are overwhelmingly middle class, with a relatively high proportion of \nprofessional and managerial workers.  Of the two leading fitness magazines in 2002, \napproximately 27% of Shape and 28% of Men\u2019s Health readers were professionals or \nmanagers, with average household incomes between approximately $57,500 (for Shape \nreaders) and $67,500 (for Men\u2019s Health). 6  As well, 65% of U.S. health club members \nhave household incomes of $50,000 or more.  Health club industry research shows that \nmembers work more overtime than average (Epaminondas, 2002: 1), suggesting a high \nproportion of professionals and managers, as these occupations are most likely to work \nlonger work weeks (Jacobs & Gerson, 1998).  Furthermore, women outnumber men \n(nearly two to one in 1988) as the consumers of exercise, health and diet books (Wood, \n1988: 25).  Although health club membership is relatively even with respect to gender \n(with women composing 52% of all members), the rate of growth of women\u201fs \nmemberships surpasses that of men\u201fs. 7 \nReflecting particular occupational requirements, attitudes, and control over \neconomic, cultural, and social forms of capital, different social groups expect different \ncapacities from the body and, consequently, demand different rewards and benefits from \nthe fields in which they operate (Bourdieu, 1984).  The growth of the fitness field\u2014and \nfitness publishing\u2014is inextricable from the tastes and preferences of the groups driving \nconsumption.  In particular, there are four areas of \u201eelective affinity\u201f (Bourdieu, 1984: \n241) between the fitness field and its consumers\u2014middle- and new-middle-class men \nand (especially) women.   \nFirst, fitness and fitness education are geared towards the middle class who are \npredisposed to regarding the body as a project, to be managed and improved through \neducation and self-improvement as an integral aspect of self-identity and social mobility \n(Bourdieu, 1984; Crawford, 1984; Featherstone, 1982, 1987; Wynne, 1998).  This \nenterprising, investment-oriented attitude towards the body is especially marked for those \nwhose work and social position explicitly depend on bodily appearance and presentation.  \nSince the late 1960s, changes in the labor market have created a new middle class\u2014a \nlarge group of people whose work requires performative and appearance management \nskills.  These \u201enew\u201f professional, managerial, technical, clerical and sales occupations \noccur within the service-producing sector, and include such individuals as financial \nbrokers, real estate agents, public relations and advertising associates, tourism and \nrecreational directors, and other personal and professional service workers (Bourdieu, \n1984: 359; Wynne, 1998).  The more one\u201fs livelihood depends on appearance and \npersonality\u2014on one\u201fs \u201ebody-for-others\u201f\u2014the more the individual has at stake in \ncultivating the body as an enterprise (cf. Bourdieu, 1984: 213; Featherstone, 1987: 64-\n65). \nSecond, the changing social, political and athletic roles of women created a \nmarket of consumers for whom physical development was part of a new, empowered \nlifestyle.  In general, women occupy a special position in the post 1960s consumer market \nin that their large-scale entrance into the labor market\u2014and its higher echelons\u2014marked \ntheir emergence as a new breed of consumers.  White, middle-class women in particular \nwere consuming not as the family provisioners, but as self-directed consumers, investing \nin themselves because they had the means to do so, and often without competing family \n 5  \nobligations given the postponement of marriage and childbirth.  When they did have \nfamilies, women were often still in the labor market: the percentage of dual-income \nfamilies has risen steadily over the past thirty years (Jacobs & Gerson, 1998).  Since the \nlate 1970s, magazines such as Self and Working Woman have offered women advice on \nwhat to do with their newfound financial, social and political independence.  One avenue \nof personal improvement was physical; buoyed by the feminist discourse of \nempowerment and legislation such as Title IX, magazines and manuals promoted \nphysical exercise as a way to realize, literally, the goal of empowerment (without \nnecessarily taking on board the complex identity of political activism).   \nThird, the genre of fitness publishing dovetailed with trends in health care and \nhealth promotion at both ends of the spectrum of political power.  At the grassroots level, \nadvocates of demedicalization criticized medical professionals\u201f expanding authority and \nintervention in everyday life (Fox, 1997; Goldstein, 1992), and called for increasing \n\u201emedical self-competence\u201f (Crawford, 1980: 374).  In much the same way that the \nsymbolic association between muscles and political empowerment has been marketed to \nwomen, fitness has been promoted as a wide-spread mode of empowerment, through \nwhich people\u2014men and women, young and (especially) old\u2014can take control of their \nbodies and health.  The interest of individuals in (re)claiming control over their health \ncare has also been reinforced at the level of health economics, which have been \ncharacterized since the 1970s by a discourse of personal responsibility for risk reduction \nand the \u201eduty to be well\u201f (Greco, 1993; see also Crawford, 1979; Ingham, 1985; Petersen, \n1997).  Exercise texts are part of an expanding range of therapeutic and educative devices \nsuch as talk shows and self-help books that inundate us with advice on how best to care \nfor and improve ourselves. \nFinally, the increasing production of fitness advice is linked to the expansion in \nchoices of consumer products and services, which have rapidly multiplied since the early \n1970s.  For example, in 1972 when Nike began selling sneakers, consumers had few \nchoices for exercise equipment and apparel.  In contrast, today\u201fs consumer chooses from \nhundreds of new sneaker models each year, creating a $13.1 billion athletic shoe market \nin the U.S. (Euromonitor, 2001).  As the fitness consumer faces an increasing number of \nchoices within a single product category, he or she increasingly relies on consumer \nguides, such as product reviews in Shape or Consumer Reports or the preferences of style \nleaders such as sports stars and celebrities.  The increasing range of consumer choices, \nthen, is accompanied by the production of an array of mutually referential educative and \nadvisory texts that repeatedly remind consumers of their options to purchase.   \n In summary, two broad social currents coincided to create the necessary \nconditions for fitness as a lifestyle and leisure industry focused upon the care and \nimprovement of the body.  Taken together, these currents\u2014the interest of the new middle \nclass and women in self-improvement, empowerment, and health education, and the \nexpanding consumer choices available to them\u2014give rise to a range of elective affinities \nbetween consumers and fitness goods and services.  With these affinities in mind, let us \nnow turn to the content of exercise manuals.   \n \n \n \n \n 6  \nConsuming Bodies \n \nThe clearest affinity between the fitness field and the middle and new middle classes is \nthe way in which fitness has been constructed as a consumer lifestyle (Bourdieu, 1984; \nFeatherstone, 1987), a mode of self-creation that takes place primarily within one\u201fs \nleisure time.  A central element in this lifestyle discourse is the body-as-enterprise, a \nproject and resource to be managed and developed through self-work and market choices.   \n The equation of fitness with an ongoing and all-encompassing lifestyle is \ncommon across a range of fitness texts, from the educational guide of the AHA to those \nexplicitly linked to the commercial industry.  For example, the AHA offers a \u201elifestyle \napproach\u201f to fitness: \u201eHow?  By adding short segments of physical activity to your \neveryday routine\u201f (American Heart Association, 1997: xv-xvi).  The manual Stronger \nFaster, by the publishers of Men\u2019s Health magazine, offers a similar viewpoint: \nWe need to stop thinking of fitness in terms of whether we got to the gym three \ntimes last week.  Rather, think of fitness as a lifestyle that touches on everything \nwe do.  Just as our work life helps define who we are, so does our fitness life. \n\u2026Fitness is a lifestyle, not three visits to the gym a week.  (Kaufman & \nKirchheimer, 1997: vi, emphasis added) \nLike the AHA, the authors of Stronger Faster are promoting fitness as an integral \naspect of life rather than an activity limited to a thirty minute visit to the health club.  \nFrom the point of view of the AHA, however, a lifestyle approach to fitness is an attempt \nto broaden the avenues of participation, and circumvent the obstacles (such as the cost of \nhealth club membership or exercise equipment) limiting access to fitness.  For the authors \nof Stronger Faster (and the commercial industry more broadly), a lifestyle approach to \nfitness is a way to broaden the opportunities for consumption, and circumvent the \nobstacles (such as shrinking leisure time, boredom, or dislike of certain kinds of \nworkouts) limiting the adoption of fitness.  Both ends of the spectrum of manuals, for a \nvariety of reasons, want to ensure that participation in fitness is not short-lived.  While \nthis comparison exaggerates the complicity of manuals such as Stronger Faster (and the \ndetachment of those by the AHA and ACSM), the point is that a range of fitness texts \nwith varying degrees of interest in readers\u201f consumption patterns are all articulating the \nsame message: fitness is a way to live.   \nThe notion that exercise and fitness define a total way of life is not new.  In the \n1930s, Charles Atlas began selling his mail-order exercise manual, which espoused an \nintegrated regime of exercise, diet, posture, sleep, and hygiene (Gaines, 1982).  What \ndistinguishes a contemporary fitness manual such as Fitness for Dummies (Schlosberg & \nNeporent, 1996) from Charles Atlas is the way in which fitness has become so \nthoroughly enmeshed in a web of commodity and corporate affiliations.  Atlas\u201fs \nadvertising boasted that the reader required no \u201eweights, springs or pulleys.  Only 15 \nminutes a day of pleasant practice\u2014in the privacy of your room\u201f (Gaines, 1982: 71).  \nToday\u201fs fitness industry, in comparison, is a network of corporate synergies involving \nproducts, texts and spaces (in which privacy is largely displaced by display), as well as \nweights, springs and pulleys.  The back cover of the ACSM manual, for example, \nincludes the following endorsement: \n\u201cAt last!  An excellent, step-by-step physical fitness workout according to the \nlatest guidelines from the leading authorities in exercise science!  \u2026You\u201fll soon \n 7  \nbe moving with ACSM and improving to a healthier, more vital way of life!\u201d \nBarbara S. Harris, Editor in Chief Shape magazine (American College of Sports \nMedicine, 1992: back cover) \nSuch promotional synergies thus affiliate the serious respectability of the ACSM \nwith the popularity of Shape magazine, pointing readers of one in the direction of the \nother.  Fitness magazines include excerpts from new exercise manuals (sometimes \nwritten by their columnists), and profile \u201ecelebrity\u201f personal trainers.  Illustrations for \nexercise articles include \u201eshot on location\u201f references, thereby promoting both the \nparticular health club setting, and clubs in general as the sites of fitness.  Exercise \nmanuals acknowledge the donation of props and space by sporting goods manufacturers \nand health clubs, akin to the strategies of product placement in Hollywood films.  For \nexample, the acknowledgements page of Self\u2019s Better Body Book (by the publishers of \nSelf magazine) reads much like a shopping list: \nSpecial thanks to: Crunch [health club chain]\u2026  Weights and Weightbench from \nthe Gym Source, 800-GYM-SOURCE. \u2026All the athletic footwear and apparel \u2026 \nprovided courtesy of LADY FOOT LOCKER. \u2026[T]o find the Lady Foot Locker \nstore nearest you, call 1-800-877-5239.  All cosmetics and skincare courtesy of \nALMAY.  Recommended products: \u2026Lipcolor: Stay Smooth Anti-Chap Lipcolor \nwith SPF 25 in Healthy. (Billings, 1998: 112) \nThis example of the marketing function of such publishing highlights\u2014in extreme \nfashion\u2014the ways in which advice about fitness includes the mapping of an entire \nuniverse of consumer choices, from \u201eHealthy\u201f lipbalm to the necessity of the appropriate \nclub and apparel.   \nEven the AHA, which reassures its readers that fitness doesn\u201ft require a \u201epersonal \ntrainer, fancy gym, or strict diet\u201f (1997: 135), acknowledges the role of consumption: \nWe\u201fll say it again: All you need to fit in fitness is a comfortable pair of walking \nshoes.  So why spend money on fitness equipment?  In a word, variety.  Variety is \nnot only the spice of life, it\u201fs what keeps physical activity fun.  Boredom, on the \nother hand, is one of the most common reasons people give for quitting regular \nexercise.  (American Heart Association, 1997: 96) \nThe field of fitness is situated within a culture of expectations for fun, immediacy, \nnovelty and variety.  Fitness educators, producers, and promoters are thus constrained not \nonly by the tastes of consumers, but also by the larger culture of instant gratification. \nThe expanding genre of fitness publishing not only publicizes the techniques of \nexercise, but also and more fundamentally promotes lifestyle as a legitimate basis for \nsocial identity and mobility (Bourdieu, 1984: 365), and leisure as the sphere of freedom \nand choice.  The body\u2014as physical capital to be honed and augmented\u2014is central to this \nleisure lifestyle; indeed, leisure has increasingly become focused on improving, \ndecorating and displaying our bodies (Rojek, 1995: 61).   \n \nCalculating Bodies \n \nIf the body is a site of consumer investment, then managing the body-as-enterprise \nrequires rendering the body accountable, predictable, and calculable.  At its most \nmundane, this involves instructing readers in how to measure their Body Mass Index \n(BMI), resting and target heart rates, and caloric expenditure for their rates of physical \n 8  \nactivity.  These mundane measurements not only furnish consumers with a knowledge of \ntheir body once reserved for medical and sport professionals, but also encourage in \nconsumers an attitude of self-monitoring and calculation.  For example, a 110-pound \nperson can burn 300 to 500 calories over an hour of fencing (Franks & Howley, 1989: \n122-23), while a 130-pound person can expect to lose 6 pounds over the course of year \nfrom playing with children (while standing) for 20 minutes each day (American Heart \nAssociation, 1997: 134).   \nSuch a literal accounting of the body is coupled with lessons in the social and \nhealth benefits of exercise, \u201eempowering\u201f individuals to minimize their health risks.  In \nthe men\u201fs workout manual, Stronger Faster, for example, health is not only a benefit of \nexercise, but a quantifiable, predictable profit: \nUnlike shortcuts that trim mere seconds or minutes from our crazed schedules, \nregular exercise\u2026actually adds quality and years to your life.  How much?  If a \n30-year-old, two-packs-a-day smoker with high cholesterol kicked the smoking \nhabit, changed his diet, and started exercising regularly, he\u201fd add 8 to 10 years to \nhis life\u2026 (Kaufman & Kirchheimer, 1997: 24) \nThe temptation is to ignore such claims as those of hyperbolic advertising, rather than \nmedical opinion; Stronger Faster is, after all, affiliated with the lifestyle magazine Men\u2019s \nHealth.  However, the manual of the AHA takes a markedly similar position: \nWhether you\u201fre twenty or sixty, physical activity is at least as important to your \nhealth as not smoking cigarettes and eating low-fat foods.  In fact, some studies \nhave shown that physically inactive people have the same risk of heart disease as \npeople who smoke two packs of cigarettes a day.  (American Heart Association, \n1997: 5) \nThe point is not to discount the (real) benefits of exercise\u2014for which there is \ncompelling scientific evidence\u2014but to highlight how the fitness discourse equates \nexercise with control over health.  This poses a potential affinity not only to those \nexplicitly interested in health self-education and self-care, but to anyone located in a \nseemingly uncontrollable social world and out-of-control environment, for whom the \nbody represents a vestigial realm of individual control and competence (Crawford, 1984).  \nSuch lessons in risk reduction, however, are not a guarantee that individuals will actually \nadopt healthy behaviors.  Instead, individuals may employ their \u201erisk\u201f knowledge for \ncreative bookkeeping, through which vices are balanced by virtues.  Fitness can thus be \nunderstood as a technique of \u201ecalculating hedonism\u201f (Featherstone, 1987: 59), allowing \nthe individual to rationalize unhealthy or irrational behavior\u2014in short, to have their cake \nand eat it too. \nBeyond minimizing health risks, the benefits of the fitness lifestyle are also \narticulated in terms of self-confidence\u2014a reward that makes sense to the bodily habitus \nof its primary consumers.  The new middle class embodies its tenuous, intermediary \nsocial position\u2014lacking the economic or cultural capital of the wealthy or intellectual \nclasses\u2014in a particularly alienated predisposition towards the body (Bourdieu, 1984: \n207).  Accordingly, the benefits of fitness are formulated in terms of assuaging the \nanxieties of the body, as in the 1978 Gold\u201fs Gym manual to weight training: \nConfidence in your body and a positive body-image are important elements in the \nmake-up of your personality.  It\u201fs hard to feel happy about yourself if you don\u201ft \nlike your body.  Weight training helps give you the feeling that you are your \n 9  \nbody, not just in it.  \u2026Your body is no longer something you drag along or \nsomething that holds you back.  (Dobbins & Sprague, [1978] 1981: 7-8) \nNote how the emphasis is placed on the link between the shape of the body, the \npersonality of the individual, and the prospect of success (if not happiness).  The writers \ngo on to observe: \nHow you look doesn\u201ft just affect the way you feel, it also affects how other \npeople treat you.  Like it or not, people judge in large part on the basis of \nappearances.  How you look is a basic part of your social identity and as you \nchange and improve the look of your body you will see a change in the attitude of \npeople you come into contact with.  (Dobbins & Sprague, [1978] 1981: 8) \nHere, control is represented not as the management of health risks but as mastery of one\u201fs \nsocial presence\u2014as confidence in and as a body.  While the appeal of such benefits cuts \nacross class lines, the authors address the reader as a member (or aspiring member) of the \nmiddle class: self-confidence, and its consequences of social mobility and esteem, are \ndesired by the reader, yet cannot be taken for granted.   \nThe benefit of confidence has particular resonance given broader cultural \ndiscourses of self-esteem for women and the poor (Cruikshank, 1993).  Exercise manuals \ncast the benefits of strength training in the appropriate language of self-actualization, as \nin the following excerpt from a women\u201fs manual for Nautilus weightlifting machines: \nExpect to see physiological changes in three areas: strength, flexibility, and \ncardiovascular endurance.  Don\u201ft be surprised if these change your entire life, \nthough, because they add up to just one thing: improved self-image.  Call it \npersonal power, or self-worth, or self-actualization, or anything you want; you\u201fre \ngoing to feel an inner strength you haven\u201ft felt before.  (Wolf, 1983: 5) \nImproved appearance and confidence are rewards that matter, particularly for those \nwhose chances for success\u2014in the labor and mating markets\u2014depend on their ability to \ncultivate an appropriate persona.  The benefits of the fitness lifestyle are not confined to \nthe realm of leisure, but impact upon one\u201fs productive capacities in a service economy. \nIn addition to increased confidence, exercise manuals promise experiential \nbenefits to the fitness consumer.  Exercise is promoted as an opportunity to feel the body, \nan experience of embodied authenticity made less common by the sedentary nature of \nworking and commuting.  These experiential benefits of exercise are formulated \ndifferently, depending on the exercise in question.  For example, bodybuilding offers the \n\u201eweight trainer\u201fs bonus\u201f: \nWhen you work your muscles strenuously with weights, you can actually feel the \nextra blood rushing into them and swelling them up.  This feeling is called a \n\u201cpump\u201d and it\u201fs one of the extra rewards of weight training.  It\u201fs a strong feeling \nof well-being in the right use of the body.  It\u201fs the \u201chigh\u201d of weight training. \n(Dobbins & Sprague, [1978] 1981: 7) \nMost memorably captured in Arnold Schwarzenegger\u201fs description of the pump as \u201ebetter \nthan coming,\u201f such an experience is not confined to weightlifting, but can also be had \nthrough aerobics: \nFrom this point on, I will often mention the \u201cburn\u201d and exhort you to \u201cgo for the \nburn.\u201d  This burn is a unique sensation that you get when you have used a muscle \nvery strenuously.  \u2026When I first did the buttocks exercise\u2026my muscles burned \nso much I had to stop three or four times during the exercise.  Now the burn \n 10  \ncomes later and I don\u201ft have to stop.  I\u2019ve even come to look forward to it.  It lets \nme know that I\u201fm really working hard.  (Fonda, 1981: 68; emphasis added) \nLike the \u201erunner\u201fs high,\u201f these lived experiences of the body afforded by exercise are \nrepresented as an opportunity for authenticity, and should not be underestimated as one of \nthe real, as well as manipulated, pleasures of fitness.   \nGiven these benefits, it seems a paradox that so few people are, indeed, fit.  \nHowever, the evidence on physical activity suggests that despite the work of the fitness \nindustry and its proxy magazines and manuals, fitness remains largely a spectator sport.  \nIn 1996, for example, the Surgeon General released a report stating that 60% of U.S. \ncitizens do not get enough physical activity to achieve any health benefits, and 25% are \nnot physically active at all (Roan, 1996).  The problem is viewed by the fitness industry \nas one of motivation.  Exercise texts use a variety of motivational strategies and \ntechniques in the attempt to bridge the gap between the symbolic production of fitness as \na lifestyle and the actual, material work of including physical activity in one\u201fs daily \nroutine.  \n \nMotivating Bodies \n \nMuch of the content of exercise magazines and manuals addresses the difficult transition, \nfor many participants, from reading about to \u201edoing\u201f fitness.  Managing the body and \nachieving its calculated rewards faces three basic obstacles.  First, the physiological \ninertia of the body means that change is slow and must be kept up.  The body is not only \nslow to change, but also prone to lose ground through aging, injury and inactivity.  \nSecond, the decline of physical education and increase in sedentary forms of work means \nthat exercise is an increasingly uncommon everyday habit; becoming fit requires \novercoming the resilience of behavioral patterns of inactivity.  Third, exercise involves a \nlot of work if the participant is to see results, which poses a challenge to an industry that \nsells fitness as leisure.  Exercise thus competes with other (less strenuous and sweaty) \nleisure activities.   \nExercise manuals commonly highlight motivation and persistence as obstacles for \nfitness consumers.  For example, the ACSM warns: \nSo now you\u201fre motivated to begin a fitness program to improve your fitness, be \nhealthier and live longer.  What\u201fs the ultimate secret of success?  In a word, \npersistence!  \u2026Unfortunately, when it comes to lifestyle changes such as \nexercise, too many people think that it\u201fs an all-or-none phenomenon.  (American \nCollege of Sports Medicine, 1998: 13) \nA similar warning sets the tone in popular, commercial manuals.  For example: \nWe don\u201ft want you to become a fitness statistic.  The fact is, among people who \nstart an exercise program, half quit within eight weeks.  Fitness for Dummies will \ngive you the knowledge to make sure that you stick with fitness for the rest of \nyour life.  (Schlosberg & Neporent, 1996: 2) \nIndeed, the attrition rate is often mobilized as a tool of motivation, challenging \nconsumers to not repeat the failures of others. \nConsumer fitness education is not simply a question of lessons in exercise, but\u2014\nmore fundamentally\u2014constitutes an education in the production of habits through \n 11  \ndiscipline.  Several elements are common across a range of manuals regarding how best \nto habituate the fitness lifestyle. \nOne motivational strategy involves the role of education, which complements the \nmiddle class\u201f educational outlook on life.  In particular, the \u201enew petit bourgeois\u2026adopts \na learning mode to life; he is consciously educating himself in the field of taste, style, \nlifestyle\u201f (Featherstone, 1987: 65).  Instructions to consumers on how to motivate \nthemselves to stick with fitness thus often include self-education, highlighting the \nassociated production of competence and expertise.  The following example from the \nACSM is typical: \nLearn all you can about the whys and hows of exercise.  If you thoroughly \nunderstand the benefits\u2026you\u201fll be more likely to stick with it.  Good instruction \nprovided by qualified exercise leaders, such as those certified by the American \nCollege of Sports Medicine, will give you the knowledge\u2026  (American College \nof Sports Medicine, 1998:14) \nConsumers require not only instruction but the right instructors in developing their \nbodies and minds.  The problem of motivation is framed for the reader as a lack of \nknowledge and expertise, and is thus remediable through self-education.  At the same \ntime, the reader\u201fs expertise is made contingent on the expert advice of the fitness text and \nthe helping hand of the certified instructor, providing an endorsement for fitness \nproducers such as personal trainers. \n In addition to the promotion of self-education, manuals suggest disciplining the \nself through routine and record-keeping.  For example, exercising at the same time each \nday, using an exercise log, and charting one\u201fs progress are ways to \u201eturn mere behavior \ninto a good habit\u201f (American College of Sports Medicine, 1998:17).  In Gym Psych, a \nmanual geared towards men, readers are encouraged to use the time-management skills \nthey already have to insert exercise into their lives: \nIn the beginning, you may want to schedule your workouts at the same time each \nday.  \u2026Making specific appointments and keeping them is something you\u201fre used \nto in life.  If you can do it for the dentist, you can do it for your sense of well-\nbeing. (Levy & Shafran, 1986: 19-20) \nIn the attempt to habituate exercise, the new behavior is thus affiliated with preexisting, \npre-established habits, such as making and keeping appointments.  Not only do these \ndisciplinary techniques of routine and record-keeping help readers to exercise, but the \n\u201ediscipline \u201emakes\u201f individuals\u201f (Foucault, 1977: 170), producing a habitual order of \nbehaviors, such as time management and self-scrutiny (and, ideally, physical exercise).   \n Self-reflection and confession are also endorsed as motivational strategies.  For \nexample, the authors of Fitness Facts, an education-oriented manual, suggest that the \nchances of fitness success\u2014or failure\u2014depend on the individual\u201fs self-critique: \nIt is impossible to progress with exercise or other health behaviors until you \nacknowledge the real reasons for your current behaviors.  Being completely honest \nwith yourself and the fitness leader is an important step in increasing healthy \nbehaviors. (Franks & Howley, 1989: 83; emphasis added) \nNote that the emphasis placed on self-reflection suggests that honesty cannot be assumed; \na legacy, arguably, of the instrumental presentation of self advocated for success in \nservice occupations, and society in general.  In addition, the fitness instructor is, once \n 12  \nagain, endorsed as the necessary complement to the reader\u201fs self-education and self-\nscrutiny.   \n The lessons of consumer fitness education echo the work of Foucault on the role \nof confession, fear, stigma, and role models in the prescriptive texts of the ancient Greeks \nand Greco-Romans (1985, 1988), as well as the effects of routine and scheduling on the \nproduction of capacities (1977).  In addition to these parallels, a revealing comparison \ncan be made between contemporary fitness texts and the archetypal modern behavior \nmodification guide: Benjamin Franklin\u201fs 1788 autobiography.  Franklin prescribed \nconstant learning, routine, record-keeping and self-reflection in the habituation of moral \nvirtues such as industry, chastity, temperance and cleanliness.  Franklin himself kept a \ndaily log, in which his transgressions against each of the virtues could be recorded and, at \nthe end of the day, reflected upon.  In this way, believing in the logic of progress, \nFranklin set out on a \u201ebold and arduous Project of arriving at moral Perfection\u201f (cited in \nEwen, 2001: 128). \nWhat Franklin did not prescribe, and what has become the sine qua non of \nhabituation and motivation in contemporary consumer culture, is material self-reward.\n8\n  \nConsider the following advice, offered in Fitness for Dummies: \nBe nice to yourself\u2026  Attach an appropriate reward to each of your long-term, \nshort-term and immediate goals.  If you lose the 15 pounds over 6 months, buy \nyourself that watch you\u201fve been wanting.  \u2026Sure, it\u201fs bribery, but it works.  \n(Schlosberg & Neporent, 1996: 28) \nAdvice of this kind tends to emphasize that the intrinsic health rewards of fitness are not \nalways sufficient.  Extrinsic rewards such as looking better and being admired (and the \nchance to shop for a new body) are promoted to women and men.  The authors of \nStronger Faster also recommend reward-shopping as a motivational technique:  \nIt makes\u2026sense to wear clothes that reveal some of your progress.  That will \nserve as a visible reminder that your hard work is paying off. \u2026[P]romise to buy \nyourself a new Armani suit when the shoulders and chest on this one get too \nsmall.  (Kaufman & Kirchheimer, 1997: 32-33) \nIf bribery is a way to motivate fitness behavior, it is significant that the bribe is \nshopping, linking the field of fitness to the reproduction of consumption more broadly.  \nBodily discipline in one sphere (exercise) is the alibi for indulgence in another \n(shopping).  Consumer culture\u201fs ethos of instant gratification is thus reconciled with the \nlong-term self-discipline of fitness.  This reward aspect of fitness motivation\u2014and \nhabituation more generally\u2014provides us with an important insight into the ways in which \nthe Protestant Ethic of self-denial coexists with the hedonistic impulses of the Romantic \nEthic (Campbell, 1987).  Self-discipline and self-gratification are not irreconcilable, but \nare configured as temporally and spatially separate aspects of the same lifestyle: do two \nmore sit-ups now, buy the wristwatch later. \nDespite the idealized lessons of self-reward and motivation, however, the tension \nbetween the self-discipline of fitness and the ethos of consumer gratification is more \ndifficult to negotiate in practice, as is suggested by the high rate of attrition among fitness \nbeginners.  The discourse of consumer lifestyles is one in which the emphasis falls more \non style\u2014the coherence between the various aspects of life, from clothing to sport, eating \nand vacations\u2014and less on life\u2014that is, on the life-long process of work on the body.   \n \n \n 13  \nConclusion \n \nCentral to the development and institutionalization of the fitness field has been the \ncultural production of consumers equipped with an informed awareness of their fitness \nchoices and resources.  Fitness texts may thus be viewed as a genre of sensibility manuals \nand manner guides, which educate individuals in the problems and solutions of social \nstatus and consumer lifestyle.  The body\u2014its health and appearance\u2014is presented as an \nenterprise, and lifestyle endorsed as the pattern of investment.  Undertaken through \nvigilant monitoring and continual body work, the success of self-improvement and self-\ncare falls upon the shoulders of the individual.   \nHowever, as individuals increasingly bear the responsibility of minimizing their \nhealth risks, the quality of population health is deteriorating in significant ways.  The \nseeming paradox in the U.S. of a booming fitness industry and soaring rates of inactivity \nand obesity is partly resolved when we consider that, by and large, fitness texts provide \nan education in how to make lifestyle decisions more so than health decisions.  Moreover, \nthese texts represent health and exercise as rational outcomes, presuming that individuals, \nif provided with sufficient knowledge, will choose to exercise more.  However, inactivity \nand obesity are less the outcomes of rational or irrational actions, than they are the \n\u201enormal\u201f responses to living in an environment of suburbs and commuting, desk jobs, fast \nfood and television remote controls (cf. Crister, 2001; Farley & Cohen, 2001).  Increasing \nmedical self-awareness does little to address the structural conditions that favor inactivity \nfor a significant portion of the population.  \nExercise texts supply specific information on physical activity, but also claim to \nprovide the objective, rational solutions to the problems of everyday life: how to choose \nbetween the multiplying options of the market; how to optimize your chances of success \nand happiness, and reduce the risks of failure and disease; how to shape a lifestyle that \nboth conforms and stands out, earning both acceptance and distinction (cf. Rose, 1996: \n156-57).  Through the fitness field, our bodies are reflected back to us through the lens of \nproducts and services, and consumption is promoted as the primary arena in which we \nmake and remake our bodies.  Through consumption we are \u201efree\u201f to choose, to create \nand control ourselves\u2014rewards that may be lacking in the world of work.  The fitness \nfield, in offering solutions to the concerns of health, empowerment, appearance \nmanagement and self-improvement, produces the sphere of leisure as a realm of freedom \nto make the most of oneself, a lesson that is, in many ways, a costly one.  \n 14  \nReferences \n \nAmerican College of Sports Medicine.

(MRI) provides the 2002 circulation \ndata for Men\u2019s Health (1.69 million), Shape (1.68 million), Self (1.55 million), and Fitness (1.18 million).  \nMRI research information is available on their web site at http:\/\/www.mriplus.com. \n 16  \n                                                                                                                                                 \n5\n The increase in the amount of press coverage is based on a subject search for \u201ephysical fitness\u201f in \nProQuest, a content database of magazines and newspapers from the early 1970s.  Although imperfect as a \nmeasure of press content\u2014particularly given the addition of titles in 1986\u2014there is a consistent increase in \nthe number of physical fitness \u201efeatures.\u201f  The number of features rose from 25 in 1980 to 63 (1985), 114 \n(1986), 331 (1990), 403 (1995), and 717 (2000), a six-fold increase between 1986 and 2000.   \n6\n Readership data from a personal interview with a Shape advertising associate, January 2002, and from the \nMen\u2019s Health press kit, 2002. \n7\n Health club industry statistics regarding membership demographics (including income and gender) may \nbe found on the website of the International Health Racquet and Sportsclub Association, IHRSA, at \nhttp:\/\/www.ihrsa.com. \n8\n Indeed, Franklin explicitly attributes the material signs of his worldly success\u2014a change from pewter to \nsilver spoons, pottery to fine china\u2014to his wife\u201fs decisions (cited in Ewen, 2001: 127), recalling Veblen\u201fs \n(1959) analysis of the role of women in conspicuous consumption. \n"}
