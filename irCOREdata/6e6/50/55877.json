Serendipitously, I  came across Jeremy \nBentham\u2019s 1816 Chrestomathia,  his vision for creating a utopian school.1 To my \nsurprise, it contained what are arguably the first competency lists for school managers, \nthe Chrestomathic Instruction Table II, Principles of School Management. Steeped as I \nam, in post modernism, reengineering, site-based management, competencies for national \nvocational qualifications, theories of accountability and performance ratings, it seemed of \npassing interest to find these ideas originated long before the 1990s. From this beginning, \nI extended my search and discovered a rich vein of nineteenth-century  school \nmanagement text books. Nineteenth-century management texts appeared to have been \npopular judged by numbers of  such publications and their sales figures.2  After 1900, \nsuch publishing appears to have  gone into hibernation, not to reappear until the last \nquarter of the twentieth century when once again, texts appeared frequently and achieved \nlarge sales.3 Enlivening the nineteenth-century text books, I found a few novels and \nbiographies with occasional revelations on school leaders and some secondary sources.4 I \nthen tested the theories promulgated in the nineteenth-century texts against archival \nsources in the County Record Office in Leicester, in England and in the Tasmanian State \nArchives in Australia. Along my journey, I discovered that there are no histories of  \nschool management per se  and hence it seemed worthwhile to attempt to fill some gaps \nin our knowledge.  \n \nBentham\/artbenth 3 \n   From these chance encounters, I began a more systematic investigation, discovering \nresemblances between nineteenth-century and late twentieth-century school management. \nIt is these likenesses which form the subject of this article, commencing with \ncommentary on the value of comparisons across time. Major issues of interest in the \nnineteenth century were selected to see if there were similar  priorities in the late \ntwentieth century and if so, how they were viewed. Those discussed here are \ncompetences and testing, effective school leadership, governance and the local \ncommunity of schools and the focus on quality assurance.  \n \nA comparative, historical outlook \nWhy make such comparisons? The overall similarity of the nineteenth with the late \ntwentieth century lies in both having been times of  major changes in educational \nprovision and in the structures and formats of  national and institutional leadership.  \nCentral governments gradually accepted the need for intervention in both periods,5 to \nmake up for the perceived inadequacies  of  community and voluntary provision and \ndirection and to bring the teaching profession  and its schools\u2019 principals under control.  \nBoth periods qualify as earthquakes in educational administration and both adopted at \nleast some similar approaches to solve the challenges of their times. In both periods, most \nareas of the Anglo-centric world experienced like issues and solutions. In  trying to calm  \nthe late twentieth-century earthquake, some very similar techniques have been revived to \nthose used in the last century. The extent to which the changes made this time around \nwill be successful in settling the earthquake must be left to time and the readers to judge. \nThis paper will  provide some historical evidence to aid that judgement.  \n  \nBentham\/artbenth 4 \n    Both periods could be characterised as having seen some degree of autonomy for their \nschools and local \u2018lay\u2019 involvement in their governance, within, eventually,  tight central \ncontrols over  the curriculum and standards to be achieved and with tough regimes of \nexternal inspection. Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors of Schools (HMI) in nineteenth-century \nEngland  had analogous powers and roles to that of  the late twentieth-century Office for \nStandards in Education (OFSTED) in England or the Education Review Office (ERO) in \nNew Zealand. Control of schooling by local communities was gradually marginalised \nduring the nineteenth century.6 Control of schooling by local politicians has been \nmarginalised in the late twentieth century as local education authorities have been \nemasculated (in England for example) or removed (as in New Zealand).  \n \n   Between 1900 and  around 1975, site based educational leadership disappeared as the \nautonomous school was completely overlaid with state controls (in Australia, for \nexample) and  with local controls (in England). Despite this, by 1975 in England, central \ngovernment considered that the teachers had taken control of the curriculum. Politicians \nregarded inspection by HMIs as a weak tool of central control over schools. It did not \nfulfil monitoring or evaluation purposes; its aim was to advise schools on development \nnot to call them to account.   Teachers were considered to be too powerfully autonomous \nand to be using teaching methods inadequate to improving pupils\u2019 achievements. This \nlatter echoes the reasons for enhanced central control of teachers in nineteenth-century \nEngland and elsewhere. A USA writer, for example, criticised the inadequacies of \nteachers who were  \u2018transient(s) snatched up for the occasion [and] paid salaries which \nhardly exceed the wages of a menial servant\u2019.7 Teachers were seen as ignorant, without \ntraining; they became teachers to escape the workhouse.8 In England, the inadequacies \nwere similar with the office of master being reportedly thrust upon the \u2018parish clerk, the \nBentham\/artbenth 5 \nday labourer, the broken down mechanic or  crippled nurse\u2019 9 many of whom earnt no \nmore than the wage of an agricultural labourer and had to take on additional employments \nto supplement their salaries.10 While these  descriptions of teachers would not be \napplicable in the late twentieth century, English teachers are still relatively poorly paid \nand work longer hours than in most other developed countries.  \n \n    To correct the failings of nineteenth-century teachers,  school management text books \nand teacher training materials, abounded with detailed, standard lesson plans and notes, \nprecisely explaining the order and content of what was to be taught and how it was to be \ntaught. These were to meet the requirements of the then national curriculum - the Revised \nCodes - introduced from 1862.  The English National Curriculum of 1988 has operated \nsimilarly culminating with 1998 introduction of the National Literacy Hour. For this, \nevery school has been issued with the same teaching materials, has received a pack of \ninstructions with what could best be described as a \u2018timed script\u2019 for the Hour and \nteachers have had to attend central government directed training sessions. The same \napproach has been adopted for the delivery of the National Professional Qualification for \nHeadteachers (NPQH). This includes such minutiae as reminders to the instructors to \nwelcome their aspirant principals to the training course and to tell them where to find the \ntoilets.11 Following this are the scripts to be used to deliver the standard overhead \ntransparencies and set notes. Today\u2019s teachers may be highly educated and pedagogically \nqualified but they are still as inadequate as their nineteenth-century forbears according to \ngovernment.   \n \n \n \nBentham\/artbenth 6 \n    Thus, similarities can be found but why look for them in history? First,  to be a self-\nrespecting discipline, educational leadership needs a history.12  Secondly, roots can \nprovide an understanding of how the present has emerged and what solutions to \nchallenges have previously been tried. This knowledge should enable the futurologists of \nour profession  and government policy makers, to reinvent what was successful in the \npast and avoid that which was not. Thirdly there is still justification in following a \nsubject for its intrinsic interest especially where  there is no other published work.13 \nFinally there is the drive of curiosity; there are no histories of   the practice of educational \nleadership at institutional level so this is a contribution to providing what the Canadian \npoet, David Helwig, in his Considerations,  describes as finding  \u2018a way to encounter  \nhistory in the streets of a  burning  city whose fire is our own...It is as much as a man can \nask for, a place to start\u2019. \n \nCompetences and testing \nJeremy Bentham\u2019s  1816 Chrestomathic Instruction Table II outlined the competences \nwhich school principals needed to master to lead to his utopia. These stressed first, the \nimportance of good human resource leadership to be achieved by checking the quality \nand functioning of the teachers.. The principal had to use staff to maximum efficiency \nwhich was to be achieved through  constantly watching staff at work (management-by-\nwalk-about in twentieth-century parlance) and by encouraging their motivation.14 \nSecondly, records had to be kept of pupils\u2019 achievements, enrolments, absenses and \nfailures, basic data for late twentieth-century performance checks to ensure \naccountability.15 Thirdly,  standards had to be improved through classifying pupils, \ntesting them and passing them through the grades.16 Bentham considered that every \nscholar should reach perfection. Twentieth-century political leaders are less optimistic but \nBentham\/artbenth 7 \nthey loudly demand the raising of standards. Schools are expected to set targets for \nimproving average pupil achievement.  One way to accomplish this  is felt to be by re-\nclassifying pupils according to ability and gender and testing pupils at key grade stages \njust as Bentham suggested. Finally, Bentham envisaged the tasks of the headteacher  (or \nthe \u2018managing master\u2019  in Bentham\u2019s nomenclature) as general inspection and direction.  \n \n     Bentham\u2019s ideas resurfaced as a  national system for England\u2019s education staff  in the \n1990s. The movement to classify all jobs with lists of competences for aspirants to \nachieve began in the 1980s with business management and encompassed virtually all jobs \nin a National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) system by the mid 1990s. In education, \ncompetences were first listed for newly qualified teachers in the early 1990s, extending to \naspirant school principals in 1997-8, to subject leaders and special needs co-ordinators \nover 1996-8 and finally to serving school principals in 1998-9. Table I illustrates some of \nthe similarities between Bentham\u2019s 1816 list and the 1997 National Standards for \nHeadteachers, published by the British government through its Teacher Training Agency \n(TTA). \nBentham\/artbenth 8 \n Table I  19th and 20th century competences for school managers \n \nCOMPETENCES OF  SCHOOL MANAGEMENT \nGeneral inspection and direction... \n \nTo provide professional leadership for a school... \nthe headteacher must provide...direction for the \nschool \n [to ensure] the quality and functions of the persons \nby whom the performance of  [teaching] is to be \ndirected... \nefficient and effective use is made of staff... \nThe headteacher is responsible for the continuous \nimprovement in the quality  of education... \nthe preservation of discipline... a disciplined learning environment... \nthe forthcomingness of evidence...[such that] the \nuniversal notoriety of all past matters of fact...[may \nbe known to ensure]...the future propriety of all \nproceedings... \nshould have knowledge of the contribution that \nevidence from inspection...can make to professional \nschool development \n \n \n[the] special object of securing perfection...of every \nscholar without exception... \nthe union of the maximum of despatch with the \nmaximum of uniformity. \nensuring high quality education for all its pupils and \nimproved standards of achievement... all pupils \nmake progress to...to expected or better than \nexpected levels \nWhatsoever can be equally well done by the \nscholar-masters...the managing master\u2019s time would \nbe very ill employed in doing \nmust devolve responsibilities, delegate tasks \nevidence must be provided to visiters - those who \ncontribute financially to the school \nprovide information...advice to the governing body \nJ. Bentham,  Chrestomathic Table II, 181617. National  Standards for Headteachers, 1997, TTA18\n \n    The language differs across the centuries but the sentiments do not. The major \ndifference is that Bentham was suggesting a utopian system. The late twentieth-century  \nTTA which implemented it, offers courses so that aspirant principals can prove their \ncompetency in these skills in the NPQH. The  TTA produces standardised training \nmaterials for these courses with little variation permitted for individual, group or regional \ndifferences. Could this be a return to  the training received by Dickens\u2019s Mr \nM'Choakumschild in  Hard Times?  \u2018He and some one hundred and forty other \nschoolmasters, had been lately turned at the same time, in the same factory, on the same \nprinciples like so many pianoforte legs\u2019.19   \n \n    There have been suggestions that the NPQH will be made compulsory though this had \nnot been agreed by 1998. If it is, it will replicate the nineteenth century when an \nexamination in school leadership was compulsory for all teachers in training. The type of  \nBentham\/artbenth 9 \nquestions candidates faced in the nineteenth century is shown below with the assignments \nset for the NPQH. The  formats in which candidates would present their work differs but \nthe topics do not.  \n1883 Examination Questions: Minutes of the Committee of Council for Education 20. \n Write a theme on \u201cAs is the master so is the school\u201d  \nHow will you proceed to form a good \u201cpublic opinion\u201d in your school?  \nWrite an essay on the duties and rewards of schoolmasters.  \nWhat means will you adopt to secure  (a) regular and (b) punctual attendance?  \n \n \n1997: NPQH Assessment Tasks for Headteachers in Preparation for Headship21\nPrepare a 15 minute presentation for your governors, setting out your vision for the school. \nDemonstrate that you can create and implement a strategic plan for improving teaching, response, progress \nand standards of attainment over a period of time.  \nDesign an  effective system for monitoring, evaluating and reviewing an aspect of a school\u2019s development \nplan. \n \n \nDefinitions of effective school leadership \nNineteenth-century writers of school management text books were by no means all \nenamoured of Bentham\u2019s competency approaches but there was generally an acceptance \nof the need for structure and order. There had to be \u2018a head master,  on whose knowledge  \nof educational principles, organising power, practical skill and governing tact, depends \nthe efficiency of the whole\u2019.22 Education was a product to be efficiently, effectively and \neconomically created and maintained, terminology that  emerged again in the post-1986 \nEducation Acts for England and Wales.  Nineteenth-century views were  well \nencapsulated by Gladman, one of the seminal school management textbook writers,  who \nrequired \u2018no little planning and arranging\u2019 by school masters bent on efficient \nadministration.23  This was to create \u2018a machine...and to put it in going order\u2019. Within this \nseemingly mechanical role, however, there was recognition that leadership was  \u2018the \nsubtle something which pervades the schoolroom and determines the character of the \nschool\u2019,24 a view shared by HMI Matthew Arnold.25 Such subtlety required creativity \nBentham\/artbenth 10 \nwhich Gladman considered vital to leadership. The combinations of the engineer and the \ninnovator have re-surfaced in the late twentieth century as reengineering; the qualities of \nleadership espoused by this movement closely parallel those of  the nineteenth century as \nTable II demonstrates.  \n \nTable II Engineering and Reengineering \n \nDefinitions of Effective  School Leadership  \n Engineering. 26 Reengineering  27\n\u2018Superintendence ought to be felt;...it should \nbe a constant, forceful, living power\u2019 \n\u2018leadership and management behaviour models \neffective learning strategies\u2019  \n\u2018there must be capacity for detecting weak \nplaces and parts that work badly\u2019 \n\u2018use of systems thinking to help analyse the \nrelationship of  functioning variables\u2019 \n\u2018inventiveness\u2019 \u2018clear statement of the purpose, vision and \nmission of the organisation\u2019 \n\u2018needs no little planning and arranging\u2019 \u2018an explicit policy defining the characteristics of \nthe learning organisation\u2019 \nthe headteacher \u2018has to supervise and adjust \n[the school\u2019s] working from time to time so as \nto get the most out of it with the least possible \nfriction...loosen or tighten the screws of the \nmachine and...oil it on occasion\u2019 \n\u2018re-definition of core management processes \n(e.g. planning, implementation and evaluation) \nin terms of their cyclical and interrelated nature\u2019 \n \n \n    Both engineering (my terminology, not Gladman\u2019s) and reengineering can be seen as \nresponses to similar circumstances. The foci of  school management  reflect a  \u2018very high \nproduct orientation\u2019,28 as was the case with the factory-output models of education used \nin the nineteenth century.   The traditionally independent, possibly individualistic \neccentricity of, English headship could not, and cannot, be permitted in a system needing \nconformity to a state pattern in order to enable all equally to gain from the education \nsystem and to ensure that standards meet those deemed necessary by government. Hence \nRule\u2019s 1894 comments could be applicable today. \nThe school master is no longer \u201cthe dominie\u201d, the judge-absolute, the king. His simple, direct, and \nunquestioned authority, that worked so wholesomely on the young mind is gone. He has become a \nfunctionary in his own old dominion; a servant to \u201cofficialism\u201d - the grandmotherly, meddlesome \nold dame whose finger spoils so many pies.29  \n \nBentham\/artbenth 11 \nThe significance of  any movement away from the independence of  school masters was \nevident in  HMI Matthew Arnold\u2019s comments on his school inspections in 1872. \n \nIn British and Wesleyan schools there is in general more of self government, and of the life and \nvigour that go with self government, than in the National Schools. They are more created by the \nclass that uses them, and managed by that class, than are the National Schools, which are, in \ngeneral, created  for the class that is to use them by the people above it. But I find that in really \ngood schools belonging to the Church of England success does practically establish for the teacher \nan independence much the same as that enjoyed by the successful teacher of a British or Wesleyan \nschool; the teacher is not over-meddled with, and is free to put forth all the vigour and initiative he \ncan find in himself. 30\n \nArnold would, no doubt, have welcomed the return of  self-managed schools in the 1980s \nin England, New Zealand, some of the Australian states and in parts of the USA. All of \nthese exist, however, within  curricular, pedagogic and standards\u2019 frameworks determined \nother than by their principals. Nonetheless, English school principals greatly value their \nindependence and would not now want to return to the previous system of  direction by \ntheir local education authorities (LEAs).  \n \nGovernance and the local community of schools \nNineteenth-century schools were very conscious of the need to be responsive to their \ncommunities. The head\u2019s duties included \u2018sustaining [the school\u2019s] reputation, \nmaintaining friendly relations with managers and parents, and, generally making the \nschool an increasing power for good in the district\u2019.31  The same responsibilities are listed \nby the 1997 TTA; headteachers should \n \n                    develop effective links with the community, including business and industry, to extend the \n                    curriculum and enhance teaching and  learning...create and maintain an effective partnership \n                    with parents to support and improve pupils\u2019 achievements and personal development. 32\n \nEffective links with the community were vital for the financial health of a nineteenth-\ncentury school. Without parental support, children would not register for particular \nBentham\/artbenth 12 \nschools and so fee income and capitation would be reduced for unpopular schools. \nWithout  governors\u2019 (termed, \u2018managers\u2019) support, many nineteenth-century \nadministrative tasks would be unfulfilled, community resources would not be \nforthcoming and advice to the head would not be available.  \n \nLate twentieth-century schools operate in the same circumstances. English schools \nhave become self-managing financially with income dependent on parental good will in \nsending their children to the school since parents now have an almost free choice of \nschool. With each child comes the  state grant to cover all of a school\u2019s expenditure \nincluding staff salaries. If the child does not come, neither does the grant. School \ngovernors have been given back the extensive powers they had in the late nineteenth \ncentury; they must now divide the responsibilities of school  leadership with headteachers \nwho must once again  \u2018manage\u2019 the governors\u2019 roles in the school. Headteachers\u2019 \naccountability is once again to their local communities and to parents, mediated through \ngovernors. \n \nThe late nineteenth century  saw  these accountabilities become irksome; the \ngovernors and parents found the duties onerous and gradually withdrew their interest. By \nthe turn of the century both parental and governors\u2019 influence was virtually extinguished \nin the English and Welsh education system and in the Australian states.33  This pattern \ncould repeat itself at the end of the twentieth century.  There are declining numbers of \nvolunteers for governorship and suggestions that the task is too demanding for  the \n\u2018layity\u2019. England\u2019s experience is paralleled in Scotland where board members (the \nScottish equivalent of school governors) have maintained their operations at the legal \nBentham\/artbenth 13 \nminimum  without seizing opportunities to  extend.34 These outcomes could have been \nrecorded by the nineteenth-century HMI, Sneyd-Kinnersley. He found the clerks to the \ngovernors \u2018fairly moithered\u2019 by their responsibilities and the governors themselves \n\u2018ignorant\u2019 and lacking the  knowledge to cope.35  The enduring significance of these \nissues is recognised in the \u00a33.5 million to be invested, from 1998, by one of England\u2019s \nmajor research bodies - the Economic and Social  Research Council (ESRC).  This money \nis to study voluntary participation in democratic institutions and one of  its areas will be \nthat of school governance.  \n \n    There are also questions of governors\u2019 effectiveness to answer. Twentieth-century \nheadteachers complain of excessive intervention by governors or of their ineffectiveness; \nheads feel that parent-governors  are too partisan to be involved in decisions for the \nwhole school. Generally, governors are felt to be important but  there is little evidence to \nlink effective governors with effective schools. OFSTED is to begin evaluating governors \nduring school inspections from 1998 (following a 1997 pilot) just as did nineteenth-\ncentury HMI. The opinion of one such in 1858 could well be accepted as apposite now: \n\u2018for efficient and popular schools...the best thing which their managers [governors] can \ndo for them is to leave them to themselves\u2019.36 It was, after all, the character of the school \nprincipal that mattered to the effectiveness of schools, not their governance. \n \n \n \nWho has not  repeatedly seen cases of the best management [i.e. governance]...where...everything \nin the school worthy of the name of education has been truly miserable: whilst, on the other hand, \nwhere [governance has] been most defective...all that is valuable prospers? The fact is that \neverything...is mainly dependent on the master...Where intelligence, uprightness, and true holiness \nmeet in his own character, the management [governance] is of little consequence.37  \n \nBentham\/artbenth 14 \nLate twentieth-century evidence seems to support this. In the many 1980s and 1990s \nresearch studies into school  effectiveness and improvement, there is scarcely a mention \nof governors at all. In the training materials produced by the government for the NPQH, \nthe diagram summarising what makes schools effective, does not include the governors \nalthough governance is a compulsory element in the NPQH course. \n \n Focus on quality assurance \nQuality assurance  has been revived as a major concern of the late twentieth century as it \nwas in the late nineteenth century. Prior to the 1990s,  an English school could expect to \nbe inspected once every two hundred years. From the early 1990s,  it became once every \nfour years; schools to be inspected received about one term\u2019s notice of their inclusion in \nthe OFSTED calendar.  This is not quite as frequent as the annual, and unannounced,  \ninspections of the nineteenth century but the foci of the visits are the same: results, \nmanagement, state of the buildings, relations with governors and parents and teaching \nquality inter alia. There is also the same emphasis on publication of  the outcomes and \nforms of league tables for comparisons of schools, to ensure that value for money is  \nbeing achieved and that pupils are doing as well as those in comparable schools.  \nNineteenth-century \u2018outputs had to be measured and, in some sense, quantified and \nstandardised\u2019.   Lancaster, for example, reported in 1803 to his patrons  that achievements \nhad more than doubled since  individual scholars at his school  could spell 20,000 words \nand worked 2,000 sums per annum.38\n    Failing schools in the nineteenth century had  fifty per cent of  their grant with-held \nand six months to remedy their defects39. For each subject failed by a child, 2\/8d  (13p) \nwas deducted from the school\u2019s grant.  After the six months period of grace, there would \nbe an unannounced inspectors\u2019 visit to check that the school had corrected its faults. \nBentham\/artbenth 15 \nMeanwhile, parents withdrew their children from such schools with consequent loss of \nfee income.  Failing schools in the twentieth century are categorised as being in \u2018special \nmeasures\u2019 while they correct their faults. If that is not achieved then they may be publicly \n\u2018named and shamed\u2019 for their inadequacies and\/or the schools are closed. Meanwhile, \nparents will be withdrawing their children from such schools with consequent loss to the \nschools  of  state grant per child. \n    Inspectors\u2019 reports seem set in much the same language over the years:  \n1882 - This school is \u2018characterised by cheerful yet exact discipline...without noise demonstration \nof authority...its organisation is such as to distribute teacher\u2019s power judiciously...the teaching is \nanimated and interesting...such  a school seeks by other means to be of service to the children who \nattend it [it had a lending library and a savings bank].40  \n1994  - The school provides learning of high quality...Teachers provide a variety of approaches to \nlearning which stimulate their pupils...The school is well led and efficiently managed and \nadministered...resources for teaching are well deployed...The school does much to promote its \npupils\u2019 spiritual, moral, social and cultural development.41  \n \n    Teachers reactions to inspection also seem to have changed little. In the 1860s:  \n \nTeachers...encouraged exam dodges...and the inspection became a game of mechanical \ncontrivance in  which the teachers will and must learn how to beat [the inspectors]...every educator \nknows...that his best results are those that cannot be measured at all...[inspection failed} to \nstimulate the intellectual life of the school. 42\n \nBy the 1890s, the situation did not appear to have improved. In Thomas Hardy's,  Jude \nthe Obscure, there is a record of a surprise visit when the pupil teacher, Sue, was at work:  \n \nThe effect of her timidity was such that she uttered a cry of fright.[The master] ...was at her side \njust in time to prevent her falling from faintness. She soon recovered herself, and laughed; but \nwhen the inspector had gone, there was a reaction. (Brandy had to be administered to save the \nday).43  \n \nThe reason for the fear was, no doubt, because of the inquisitorial power of the \ninspectorate on whose assessment depended  the school\u2019s allocation from the Treasure \ngrant, just as has become the case in the late twentieth century. This system was criticised \nby nineteenth-century HMIs44 and its re-introduction does seem to have also re-\nintroduced some to the ways in which nineteenth-century school teachers attempted to \nBentham\/artbenth 16 \ncircumvent the best intentions of HMI. 1990s\u2019 teachers have been accused of  \u2018cheating\u2019 \nin preparation for  OFSTED inspections, e.g. disruptive pupils are discouraged from \nattendance during the  inspection week; the considerable time spent on preparing \npaperwork for OFSTED inspections has been attacked for distracting teachers from \nteaching; inspections are felt to be non-developmental experiences. At the same time, \nOFSTED is considered to have impacted favourably on improving school results; \nheadteachers and governors admit that the reports often reinforce what they themselves \nhave criticised in their own schools and some poor schools and staff have been \nremoved.45  \n \n      In addition to the \u2018sticks\u2019 of  HMI inspection, nineteenth-century teachers had the \n\u2018carrot\u2019 of merit pay. If a school were deemed by the inspectors to be successful then a \nmerit grant was achieved. Attempts  were made to reintroduce this idea during the 1980s \nwith the money to be allocated to individual teachers. The profession undermined the first \nattempts to do this but government began testing professional and public reaction to the \nidea in 199846. A grade of Advanced Skills Teacher was introduced from September 1998 \nwith salaries enhancement of about \u00a310,000 above the top of the teachers\u2019 pay scale. This \nre-introduction of \u2018payment-by-results\u2019 can also be seen in the creation of the Education \nAction Zones. These are public\/private partnerships to be established to run schools in \ndisadvantaged areas and these will be able to suspend national pay scales and to devise \ntheir own.  \n \n \nConcluding Reflections \nBentham\/artbenth 17 \nThe extent to which these eclectic comparisons are reassuring or disturbing are likely to  \ndepend upon the  readers\u2019 perceptions of the state of  modern schooling and on whether \nor comparisons across such vast tracts of time are seen as facile.  My own views are that \ncomparisons may be odious but they are fun. This can best be  summarised in an adapted \nversion of Arthur Sullivan\u2019s mid-nineteenth-century drawing room ballad, The Lost \nChord, which here becomes: \nThe Lost Leader?  \nSeated one day in the school room, \nI was weary and ill at ease,  \nAnd I glanced at my leadership textbook  \nTo seek new ways to please; \nI found  Gladman\u2019s engineering,  \nTo structure my classroom ways, \nOne utopia of  Bentham\u2019s vision,  \nTo lead them all  my days,  \nto lead them all the days. \nIt may be that  reengineering, \nWill speak in the vision again; \nWe\u2019ll  maintain quality assurance,   \nSo great schools will remain; \nLet us hope that schooling\u2019s bright angel, \nWon\u2019t let us make  mistakes again, \nSo e\u2019en in this earthly Heaven, \nThere\u2019ll be no leadership strain. \n \n \nReferences \n \n1 J.
