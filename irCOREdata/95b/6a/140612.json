Tel: +44 1234 754 101; Fax +44 1234 751 671; E-mail s.pollard@cranfield.ac.uk\n2high rainfall leads to the production of large volumes of dilute leachate; (ii) there are appropriate1\nareas of land for irrigation; or (iii) where isolation from sewer watercourses makes off-site2\ndisposal difficult or expensive. The practice has been regarded as suitable for dilute, high volume3\nleachate and for the polishing of pre-treated leachate. To be successful, it relies on a combination4\nof physicochemical and biological processes (plant uptake, evapotranspiration, oxidation,5\nnitrification, denitrification, absorption and adsorption) for treating leachate volume and pollutant6\n(chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), inorganic nitrogen) load7\n(Tyrrel et al., 2002). In Cornwall, for example (Ankers and Ruegg, 1993), leachate8\nconcentrations of up to 1500 mg BOD5 \/l and 300 mg NH4+-N\/l, have been spray irrigated to9\nwoodland at appropriate loadings that show no detrimental effects on the irrigated vegetation; the10\nloadings having been established on the basis of extended operational experience (Cornwall11\nCounty Council, 1994). Irrigation equipment used historically includes slotted pipes, rain guns,12\nsprinklers and spray nozzles. The practice was common in the UK during the late 1970s and early13\n1980s, though fine spray irrigation has decreased in recent years. Currently, most operations are14\nconducted using larger spray guns to redistribute leachate within the landfill site (Figure 1).15\nApplication rates per unit area vary substantially (Table 1) but are typically in the order of ca. 5016\n(m3\/ha)\/d (Knox, 2003; personal communication). Irrigation volumes applied vary widely and17\nseasonally (Table 1) and the practice is regulated through limits on volume and nitrogen load to18\nthe receiving land through regulatory conditions on waste management licences.19\nSpray irrigation results in the generation of aerosols, the volatilisation of contaminants20\nand may result in the subsequent exposure of human receptors (workers, bystanders) to hazardous21\ncomponents in leachate through inhalation, ingestion or dermal exposure routes. Operators of22\nwaste facilities have statutory obligations with respect to protecting workers and public health.23\nThe general approach for assessing exposures to bystanders from chemical sprays has been to24\nassume that, since bystanders may be exposed less frequently than workers, worker exposure,25\nproviding it is found not to be significant, is protective of public health (ACP, 2002).26\nThis study concerns the preliminary screening of potential exposures in hypothetical site27\nworkers to specific leachate constituents during the spray irrigation of landfill leachate, with28\nbroader public health considerations in mind. We seek to understand the potential significance (in29\nterms of the relative order of magnitude) of exposures that might arise from this practice and the30\nrelative contributions to total exposure from a range of exposure routes and hazardous31\ncomponents present in typical UK landfill leachate. In this context, the study might contribute to32\n3the risk screening requirements for landfill sites recently by the regulator (Environment Agency1\n(2004). Our approach has been to modify and apply a shower model combined with an outdoor2\nair box model (Foster and Chrostowski, 1986; Walden and Spence, 1997) to represent an3\nexposure space, or volume, on site, and to use generalised data from UK leachates as the source4\nterm for estimating exposures to hypothetical and maximally exposed workers. The risk estimates5\nand hazard quotients generated cannot be regarded as definitive quantitative predictions of health6\nrisk. Their value is in illustrating the dominant exposure routes and likely chemicals of concern7\nand thus in highlighting where further study might best be focused. Following an initial screen, a8\nquantitative examination of the implications of varying certain key parameters in the analysis was9\nundertaken. Results are interpreted in the context of the literature on dermal and inhalation10\nexposures to chemicals in outdoor sprays.11\n12\nModelling exposures from spray irrigation13\nThe estimation of human exposure to chemicals in sprays has its origins in the quantitative14\nmodels used to estimate exposures to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in shower stalls and in15\nthe development of regulatory models for the control of exposures to pesticide spray (van16\nHemmen, 1993; Hamey, 2001; USEPA, 2001; European Commission, 2002). The modelling of17\ninhalation exposures to contaminants from water used during showering is reported by several18\nworkers (Andelman, 1985; McKone, 1987, 1992; Little 1992a, 1992b). One model, the Integrated19\nHousehold Exposure Model (IHEM; Foster and Chrostowski, 1986) examines potential20\nhousehold exposures to VOCs through the ingestion of drinking water, inhalation of volatiles21\nwhile showering, inhalation of water while bathing and through dermal absorption while bathing.22\nAn assessment of the IHEM (Carver et al., 1991), notes it as the most conservative of a range of23\nmodels, predicting shower air concentrations approximately double those of the least24\nconservative model. The IHEM is based on the two-film, gas-liquid mass transfer theory. The25\nrate of volatilisation across the surface of a hypothetical droplet is estimated and the volatile26\nchemical concentration in the air is predicted using the concept of dilution within a box. The27\nmodel assumes that a volatile organic chemical evaporating into the air of the shower stall (the28\n\u2018box\u2019) is completely mixed and there is no build up of the volatile organic chemical at the air-29\nwater interface. It does not take time-dependent distributions or in vivo toxicological30\nconsiderations following exposure into account.31\n4Shower models have been adapted to simulate the volatilisation of contaminants during1\nspray irrigation. Walden and Spence (1997) applied the IHEM to a US groundwater irrigation2\nscenario in which potential exposures to BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes)3\ncompounds were a concern. Residential use of contaminated groundwater for watering lawns or4\ngardens (including vegetables) was considered and exposures, including the dermal contact of5\nchildren playing under the sprinkler with spray, the ingestion of groundwater by the child, and6\nthe vapour inhalation by the adult or child under, or downwind of the receptor, were modelled.7\nThe model estimates vapour emissions from spray and the aqueous concentrations of8\ncontaminants in grounding spray. Air phase concentrations are estimated assuming complete9\nmixing of air in the box and dilution within the box volume. Volatilisation is limited by mass10\ntransfer rates.11\nBriefly, the overall mass transfer coefficient is calculated as (see Glossary, for symbols):12\nKL = [1\/k1 + RT\/Hkg]-1 (1)13\nGas and liquid phase mass transfer coefficients for contaminants can be estimated from measured14\nvalues for carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) and the following correlations:15\nkg(VOC) = kg(H2O) [18\/MWVOC]0.5 (2)16\nkl(VOC) = kl(CO2) [44\/MWVOC]0.5 (3)17\nThe overall mass transfer coefficient is adjusted for the shower temperature and the viscosity of18\nwater at the lower temperature:19\nK'L(Ts) = KL[Tl\u00b5s\/Ts\u00b5l] -0.5 (4)20\nVolatilisation is assumed to be a first order process:21\nCsh = Coe - KLt\/600d (5)22\nThe total amount of contaminant that volatilises is given by:23\nMsh = fv . Q . timesh .Co (6)24\nFinally, the concentration of the shower air can be estimated from:25\nCsh = Msh\/Vsh (7)26\nWalden and Spence (1997) coded the model into the peer-reviewed BPRISC4 (British27\nPetroleum Risk Integrated Software Cleanup) software program (version 4, BP, 2001). Modelling28\na spray irrigation scenario, the concentration of volatilised chemicals in the air is calculated using29\nan outdoor box approach, where the \u2018shower\u2019 volume (Vsh), the volume of air in which exposure30\noccurs, is represented by a hypothetical box. The dimensions of the box are defined by the31\nproduct of the wind speed and exposure time, the width of the spray source and the height of the32\n5receptor. The rate of mass volatilisation is calculated and the air in the box is assumed to be1\nventilated - differing from the shower scenario, where the air is stagnant and a total volatilised2\nmass is calculated. The model assumes that the air in the box is fully mixed, the concentration in3\nthe box is constant and the receptor is inside the box. The model only considers on-site exposures4\nand does not consider receptors at distance from the source. The on-site exposure will be more5\nconservative than any exposures downwind of the source.6\n7\nMETHODOLOGY8\n9\nRationale10\nCaution must be exercised in conducting and interpreting quantitative risk studies (HSE, 2003).11\nConceptual models of exposure and the subsequent characterisation of risks rely on numerous12\nassumptions, many of which have gross incertitude. The value of such analyses is in providing13\ninsights into system behaviour, rather than definitive point estimates of risk, for the purpose of14\ninforming an appraisal of the options for managing risk (Paustenbach, 2002a). To this end, the15\naim of this study was to understand the relative importance of a range of exposure routes and16\ntrace components in a generalised leachate for worker and bystander exposure during spray17\nirrigation.18\n19\nSource term data20\nLeachate compositional data were abstracted from Robinson (1995), Knox et al., (2000) and21\nRobinson and Knox, (2001) (Table 2). These studies reported analytical data on approximately22\n4000 leachate samples for 72 landfill sites throughout the UK (Robinson, 1995). Knox et al.,23\n(2000), further reported on 57 organic substances and 8 metals listed in the UK Pollution24\nInventory (PI), in raw and treated leachates from UK landfills. Following extension of the PI in25\n2002 to include a further 32 substances, these researchers sampled raw leachate and treated26\neffluent from 24 leachate treatment plants. Thirty six substances were tested for and of these 1727\nwere present in more than 5% of samples (Robinson and Knox, 2001). Our assessment was28\nlimited to 17 chemicals (Table 2), selected (i) on the basis that they were identified in >5% of the29\nleachates sampled; and (ii) on account of their accepted toxicological relevance and the30\navailability of toxicological data. With respect to chemical classes and multivalent species, for31\nease, total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (\uf053PAH) were represented by benzo[a]pyrene32\n6alone, as a conservative surrogate. Similarly, hexavalent chromium (CrVI) represented the total1\nchromium content of the leachate. Analytical data expressed PCBs in Aroclor 1260 equivalents2\nand the toxicological profile for this substance was used to represent the mixture of PCB3\ncompounds. Where dose-response assessment data were not available for each exposure route,4\nroute-to-route extrapolations were invoked; oral carcinogenic slope factors and oral reference5\ndoses (RfDs) being used for dermal and inhaled exposures for organic compounds. Route6\nextrapolations were not made for inorganics due to reported differences in absorption efficiencies7\nfor the two routes of exposure. This is acceptable within BPRISC4 (BP, 2001) and is supported,8\nfor example, by regulatory guidance in the US EPA's Region 9 Preliminary Remediation Goals9\n(EPA, 2003).10\n11\nOperational assumptions for spray irrigation12\nThere is considerable scope for variation in flow rates for the irrigation of leachate with the type13\nof irrigation system used and loading rate of the soil, as well as with the age, type and location of14\nthe landfill site (Ankers and Ruegg, 1993; Alker et al., 2002). Estimated values for flow rate vary15\nwidely from ca. 11 l\/min (Alker et al., 2002) to >800 l\/min (Webb, 2003; personal16\ncommunication). A nominal flow rate of 100 l\/min was selected as a reasonable assumption. A17\nreview of spray droplet distribution data from Kohl (1974), Edling (1985), Soloman et al.,18\n(1985), Li et al., (1994) and Kincaid et al., (1996) and the rationale given by Walden and Spence19\n(1997) resulted in the selection of a value of 0.2 cm for the droplet diameter. The droplet20\nresidence time represents the length of time that a particular droplet is available to contribute21\nemissions of volatile contaminants to the outdoor box. A conservative assumption of droplet22\nresidence time is 10 s, to account for volatilisation occurring from water travelling through the air23\nto the point where it is puddled or standing before it soaks into the soil, after which volatilisation24\nis assumed not to occur.25\nLocalised environmental conditions influence exposure. For the probabilistic analysis,26\ntriangular distribution data for average wind speed were approximated from the UK annual mean27\nwind speed (BWEA, 2003), values for mean, minimum and maximum being 5, 0 and 9 m\/s,28\nrespectively. Finally, because volatilisation increases with temperature and spray irrigation of29\nleachate tends to be carried out during the summer, a leachate temperature of 20\uf0b0C was used.30\n31\n7Receptor characteristics1\nReceptor assumptions are presented in Table 3. A hypothetical maximally exposed receptor is an2\nadult worker occupationally exposed to leachate spray. In this study, receptor assumptions were3\nbased, where appropriate, on the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\u20194\n(Defra\u2019s) Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment (CLEA) model (Defra, 2002). In CLEA, the5\ncritical receptor is a female aged 15 to 69 years. BPRISC4 default values of fraction of total skin6\nsurface area exposed (10%; hands and forearms) were selected, where the CLEA value is for7\nexposed hands only. The duration of exposure by the potential receptor is highly site-specific, but8\nshould reflect a reasonable estimate of the time spent by the receptor in the outdoor box. For9\nconsideration of an adult worker on a landfill site during spray irrigation, a conservative estimate10\nof time spent in the outdoor air box is 4 hours, while the maximum would be 8 hours. The11\nnumber of exposure events per year is based on irrigation during the eight warmest months, for a12\n5 day working week i.e. 175 days or events\/year. BPRISC4 default estimates of typical exposure13\nduration for workers is 8.3 years, with a maximum of 50 years (US Bureau of Labor Statistics,14\n1992). These assumptions were regarded as suitable for the purposes of this screening study.15\n16\nModifications to the outdoor air box17\nThe inhalation of aerosol in spray is a route of potential concern. BPRISC4 does not code for18\nexposures due to inhalation and ingestion of aerosols (i.e. very fine water droplets) and the model19\nrequires modification. Exposure to contaminants that may be dissolved or suspended in the20\nleachate, and then inhaled and inwardly ingested as aerosols was assessed in the same fashion as21\nthe ingestion of irrigated groundwater in the BPRISC4 model. Whilst this approach does not22\naccurately account for aerosols taken directly into the lung airways, it does allow for exposures23\nfrom larger aerosols trapped in the upper respiratory tract and ingested. A conservative24\nassumption of the percentage of irrigated leachate that would aerosolise was chosen as 1%v\/v25\n(Sorber et al., 1976; Camann et al., 1978, 1988). For a 4-hr exposure and a flow rate of 10026\nl\/min, this gives an estimate of 240 l. The volume of the outdoor air box was estimated to account27\nfor the total volume of leachate irrigated. This required selecting a value for the width of the28\noutdoor air box to reflect the diameter of the spray area. Examination of data for irrigation29\nequipment, suggested considerable variation between wetted spray radii of different irrigation30\nsystems. Using literature data, conservative estimates of spray diameter (10 m), wind speed (231\nm\/s), exposure time (4 hr) and receptor height (2 m), provide a value for the volume of the32\n8outdoor air box (576,000 m3). Thus the concentration of aerosolised leachate in the air box may1\nbe estimated (0.42 ml\/m3), assuming instantaneous dispersion and no settling of the aerosol over2\nthe exposure time.3\n4\nExposure assessment and risk characterisation5\nGiven an active respiration rate for an adult female receptor of 1.2 m3\/hr, the rate of inhalation of6\naerosol can then be estimated at 0.52 ml\/hr. For a 4-hr exposure time and flow rates of 50 and7\n1000 l\/min, the rates of inhalation of aerosol are 0.26 and 5.2 ml\/hr respectively. Although the8\nmodel is conservative in that it assumes that aerosols are dispersed and do not settle during9\nexposure, it cannot account for the position of the receptor relative to the source within the10\noutdoor air box, i.e., the closer the receptor the greater the volume of aerosol the receptor is likely11\nto inhale.12\nA generalised leachate was subjected to probabilistic analysis in BPRISC4 using mean,13\nminimum and maximum leachate compositional data from UK leachates (Table 2). Probability14\ndistributions of risk were generated on 10 000 iterations of the model using parameter15\ndistributions identified in Table 3. BPRISC4 adopts a US approach to risk estimation and risk16\ncharacterisation for long term exposures. Chronic average daily doses (CADD; glossary for17\nabbreviations) for non-carcinogens and lifetime average daily doses (LADD) for carcinogens are18\nestimated using (Walden & Spence, 1997; BP, 2001):19\nFor inhalation20\nLADD = Cair.InhR.AAFinhal.LRF.ET.EF.ED\/(365.LT.BW) (8)21\nCADD = Cair.InhR.AAFinhal.LRF.ET.EF\/(365.LT.BW) (9)22\nFor dermal contact23\nLADD = 10-3Cw.SA.FS.AAFdermal.ET.PC.EF.ED\/(365.LT.BW) (10)24\nCADD = 10-3Cw.SA.FS.AAFdermal.ET.PC.EF\/(365.LT.BW) (11)25\nFor ingestion26\nLADD = 10-3Cw.IRiw.ET.AAF.EF.ED\/(365.LT.BW) (12)27\nCADD = 10-3Cw.IRiw.ET.AAF.EF\/(365.BW) (13)28\n29\nFor carcinogens, risks are estimated as individual excess lifetime cancer risks (IELCR):30\nIELCR = SF.LADD (14)31\n9Potential non-carcinogenic effects are evaluated using the hazard quotient (HQ) and, where1\nrelevant, the hazard index (HI):2\nHQ = CADD\/RfD (15)3\nHI = \uf053HQ1 +HQ2 + HQ3\u2026.HQn (16)4\nThe (US) carcinogenic slope factor and hazard quotient approach to risk characterisation above is5\nnot adopted in the UK. Occupational and dietary exposures are assessed by reference to6\noccupational exposure limits (OELs), including maximum exposure limits (MELs) for7\ncarcinogens, and tolerable daily intakes (TDIs); and are referenced to air concentrations and dose,8\nnot risk (Illing, 2001). For pesticide sprays, an acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL \u2013 a9\ndose) is used (ACP, 2002). Environmental exposures are conventionally characterised by10\nreference to the drinking water and air quality guidelines (Defra, 2001), that act as risk-based11\nquality standards, expressed as concentrations, in the exposure medium of concern. The above12\ntoxicological criteria are referenced to individual statutes and do not easily fit the range of13\nexposures considered in this study. For screening purposes therefore, risks were assessed using14\nthe US approach and dose-response data obtained from the USEPA integrated risk information15\nsystem (IRIS; USEPA, 2003), a database of human health effects that may result from exposure16\nto various substances found in the environment. The updated RISC4 (BP, 2001) software is cross-17\nreferenced to IRIS.18\n19\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION20\n21\nRisk estimates and apportionment22\nRisk estimates for the spray irrigation of generalised leachate, with a nominal flow rate of 10023\nl\/min and droplet diameter of 0.2 cm, are summarised in Tables 4 to 7. Taking an IECLR24\n(expressed as a lifetime risk, not an annual) of 1E-04 (1 in ten thousand; LaGrega et al., 2001) as25\nan upper bound guideline for exposure to carcinogens from leachate and, for screening purposes,26\na HQ value of 1E+00 (i.e. 1) as an indicator level for non-threshold contaminants, we can screen27\nfor exposure routes and principal chemicals of concern within the subset of 17 candidates28\nsubstances (Tables 4 to 7). Acknowledging the uncertainties and model artefacts inherent to such29\nan exercise and discussed below, an examination of the risk estimates modelled using this30\nconservative worst case exposure scenario suggests that they are not of a sufficient order of31\n10\nmagnitude to warrant major concerns about the chemical risks to workers or bystanders from this1\npractice in a general sense.2\nIn terms of contribution to exposure and reviewing the 95th %ile values in Tables 4 to 5,3\ndermal contact with spray and benzo[a]pyrene emerge as key contributors to the potential4\ncarcinogenic risk. Were we to adopt a toxicological equivalency factor (TEF) approach to5\napportioning the toxicity of \uf053PAH between individual PAH the contribution would be lowered6\nsignificantly. For illustrative purposes, if the risk component attributable to benzo[a]pyrene is set7\naside, the potential carcinogenic risk is reduced substantially with the key contributions to dermal8\nexposure from Aroclor 1260, arsenic and dichloromethane (Figure 2) at the 95th %ile level. The9\nHI data by route and by chemical from the Monte Carlo analysis are summarised in Table 6 and10\n7, respectively. In terms of overall hazard, the major contributing routes are dermal contact and11\nthe inhalation of volatile components from spray irrigated leachate. None of the indices are12\nexpressed at a level of significance (i.e. HQ > 1). From Table 7, leachate components with the13\nhighest contribution to hazard quotient are Aroclor 1260, arsenic, CrVI, lindane, mercury,14\ndichloromethane, naphthalene, toluene and xylenes. Again, because of the toxicity \/ permeability15\ncoefficient of Aroclor 1260 used for all PCBs in the leachate and because the significant route of16\nexposure is by dermal contact, its contribution to the overall hazard is artificially increased.17\n18\nSensitivity analysis19\nThree simulations were executed varying certain of the input parameters: (i) decreasing the20\ndroplet diameter to 0.02 cm, since volatilisation increases with a decrease in droplet size (Edling,21\n1985); (ii) increasing the flow rate to 1000 l\/min; and (iii) decreasing the flow rate to 50 l\/min, to22\nreflect the variance in operational practice. An analysis of the carcinogenic risk estimates for each23\nroute is shown in Table 8 and for the hazard quotients, in Table 9. Again, dermal contact with24\nirrigated leachate spray drives the exposure under these scenarios that assume that 10% of the25\nreceptor's skin surface area is wetted for 4 hr\/d.26\nAdjusting operational variables such as flow rate, droplet size, droplet residence time and27\nthe dimensions of the outdoor air box, appears to exhibit little effect on the level of dermal28\nexposure. This may appear counterintuitive. One normally expects, from Fick\u2019s law of diffusion,29\ndermal absorption to be directly proportional to the applied concentration and the amount of30\nchemical applied (entering the box; Paustenbach, 2002b). However, in the spray scenario, dermal31\nexposure is not sensitive to flowrate and droplet size because it assumes that the skin is32\n11\ncompletely wet already and that there is enough water exchange (from the water already in1\ncontact with the skin) so that chemicals are not further depleted as they become absorbed. Under2\nthese assumptions, the only pathway-specific exposure parameters that dermal exposure to3\nsprayed water pathway is dependent on are skin surface area in contact with water and the time4\nspent in the water. The chemical-specific dermal permeability coefficients are also time5\ndependent. Note this is quite different than the mechanism used for dermal absorption from6\nchemicals in soil. By means of illustration, dermal contact was excluded as a route from the7\nanalysis and the effects of operational variables on the other two routes compared with a8\n\u2018baseline\u2019 flow rate of 100 l\/min (Figure 4). These data indicate that over a reasonable range of9\ninput values, flow rate is an important input variable when estimating exposures via inhalation10\nand ingestion as one would intuitively expect. All values for IECLR via ingestion of leachate11\naerosol or inhalation are proportionately less for a flow rate of 50 l\/min compared with a flow12\nrate of 1000 l\/min, or reduced droplet size (and a flow rate of 100 l\/min). Data for the inhalation13\nroute are closer for a droplet size of 0.02 cm compared with a flow rate of 1000 l\/min, and greater14\nin comparison to the values for the baseline flow rate of 100 l\/min and droplet size of 0.2 cm,15\nalthough within the same order of magnitude. The analysis suggests that droplet diameter also16\nplays a significant role in the extent of volatilisation and subsequent exposure for the inhalation17\nof volatile components. Minimum, mean and 95th %ile values for IECLR are greater for the18\ningestion of leachate aerosol than corresponding values for the inhalation of volatile19\ncontaminants, suggesting that the ingestion route is of greater significance in this scenario.20\nExamination of data for the minimum, mean and 95th %ile values of HQ (Figure 5) indicate a21\nreversal of this order. Nevertheless, these effects are masked by the apparent dominance of the22\ndermal to the total exposure.23\n24\nModel artefacts25\nAs discussed earlier, the width of the outdoor air box is assumed to be constant at 10 m. This is a26\nconservative assumption based on examination of data for 360\uf0b0 rotating sprinklers, which are27\nsubject to very large variations between irrigation systems. The width of the outdoor air box is28\nalso treated as if the flow rate was from a single static sprinkler head, rather than from several29\nsprinkler heads spaced along a distribution pipe allowing spray overlap, or from mobile spray30\nirrigation systems. This considerably reduces the size of the outdoor air box and therefore31\nincreases the concentration of volatilised contaminants within the box. Thus our assumptions32\n12\nabout the air box are regarded as conservative. Further, the BPRISC model assumes that the1\nspray (and\/or volatile chemicals) is limited to the height of the receptor. All contaminants are2\nassumed to stay below that height and are assumed to pass by the receptor. Therefore, a3\nconservative assumption for height of the box is 2 m for an adult; this would be reduced for4\nconsideration of a child receptor. Use of the surrogate benzo[a]pyrene for \uf053PAH and Aroclor5\n1260 for \uf053PCB accounts for further artefacts in terms of the magnitude of the risk estimates in6\nthis study. This said, the pattern of exposure is consistent with other spray studies within the7\npesticide spray and exposure literature.8\n9\nAnalogous studies from pesticide spray \u2013 bystander risk assessments10\nIn this study, the dermal contact route is a function of concentration, the dermal permeability11\ncoefficient, the fraction of skin exposed and the exposure time, and was shown to be12\ninsufficiently sensitive to other variables such as wind speed or flow rate. To confirm,13\nsimulations were conducted for each of the following variables in turn: wind speed, water14\ntemperature, droplet time, droplet diameter, flow rate and spray width and we found no15\nappreciable difference for 95% ile risk estimates and only slight differences for the maximum16\nvalues in two cases (when droplet time changed to 100 seconds; and where flow rate was17\nincreased to 10 000 l\/min).18\nIt is useful to consider our findings in light of research on worker and bystander exposure19\nto pesticides, where the dermal and inhalation routes of uptake can also be important (Hamey,20\n2001; European Commission, 2002; ACP, 2002). Ross et al., (2001) have argued that pesticide21\ntoxicology studies have much to offer occupational risk assessments, in particular, with respect to22\nour understanding of dermal exposure. Considering the validity of our modification of Walden23\nand Spence (1997) to account for aerosol inhalation exposure, ACP (2002) reported two24\nexperimental studies undertaken by the former Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (Lloyd25\nand Bell, 1983; Lloyd et al., 1987) on pesticide exposures to bystanders (persons incidentally26\nlocated at or adjacent to the site of pesticide application who take no action to control exposure)27\ndownwind (8 m) of the spray drift. Harmless tracers were used. From studies of arable crop spray28\nin high wind speeds (Lloyd and Bell, 1983; Lloyd et al., 1987) inhalation exposures of ca. 0.0229\nml\/m3 (max. values 0.1 ml\/m3) and 0.002 ml\/m3 were estimated. At a distance of 5 m from30\nconventional pesticide spray equipment, the typical levels of pesticide spray drift deposited on31\nthe ground are reportedly ca. 1% of the applied dose (ACP, 2002). Using this assumption with32\n13\nrespect to dermal exposure, Ganzelmeier et al. (1995) estimated bystander exposure to pesticide1\nspray 5 m from the point of application (at 200 l\/ha) to be < 0.4 ml\/person. These analogous2\nstudies reinforce our view that an aerosol exposure estimate of 0.42 ml\/m3 is a reasonable worst3\ncase estimate.4\n5\nCONCLUSIONS6\n7\nThe spray irrigation of landfill leachate is regarded by many operators as an attractive option for8\nmeeting discharge consent limits when considered alongside the costs of tankering leachate off-9\nsite for specialist treatment. Spray irrigation releases volatiles from the leachate volume and10\ndisperses leachate in the form of a fine mist that can be inhaled, ingested or deposited on the skin11\nof site workers. To date, no estimate of these exposures to site workers or bystanders has been12\nconducted. A risk screening exercise in this study used an accepted air box model, with13\nmodifications. Chemical exposures to a hypothetical and maximally exposed worker during the14\nsimulated spray irrigation of landfill leachate were screened and the IHEM developed to simulate15\nthe ingestion of leachate aerosol.16\n17\n(i) Routes of exposure were ranked in the following order according to their contribution to18\ncarcinogenic risk: dermal contact >> ingestion of aerosol > inhalation of volatiles; and,19\nhazard index: dermal contact >> inhalation of volatiles > ingestion of aerosol. Whilst the20\nquantification of site-specific risk estimates from the spray irrigation of leachate may21\nrequire additional study and was not the purpose of this work, it is prudent for workers to22\nwear suitable personal protective clothing where they are likely to be in close proximity to23\nsprayed leachate, or remain beyond the spray radius.24\n25\n(ii) Increasing flow rate to 1000 l\/min, and to a lesser extent reducing droplet diameter to 0.0226\ncm from the 'baseline' parameters of 100 l\/min flow rate and 0.2 cm droplet size, resulted27\nin increased contribution to both risk and hazard due to inhalation exposure, but had little28\neffect on dermal exposures. Procedures to reduce irrigation flow rate and\/or high29\npopulations of fine droplets, such as lower operating pressures, larger nozzles, low or30\ndownward pointing spray trajectories may serve to reduce potential exposures, by31\n14\nminimising volatilisation and spray mist.1\n2\n(iii) The quantitative risk estimates modelled using this conservative worst case exposure3\nscenario are not of sufficient magnitude to warrant major concerns about chemical risks to4\nworkers or bystanders from this practice in the general sense. This would also require5\noccupational exposure limits and environmental assessment levels for these substances to6\nbe exceeded in the occupational setting. However, it should also be noted that the7\nmodelling made use of generic concentration data for only a limited number of potential8\nlandfill leachate contaminants, such that individual practices may require assessment on9\nthe basis of their own merits.10\n11\n(iv) This study adopted a generalised conservative modelling approach. Processes and model12\nfeatures for site-specific application and that, were they better characterised within the13\nmodel with site data, might lessen the conservative nature of the approach include: (a) the14\ndispersion and aerosol deposition within the outdoor box; (b) a more representative15\nanalysis of exposure times; (c) inclusion of various spraying regimes e.g. under coppice16\ncanopies.17\n18\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS19\nThis work was funded by the Environment Agency of England and Wales to whom we are20\ngrateful for permission to publish.
