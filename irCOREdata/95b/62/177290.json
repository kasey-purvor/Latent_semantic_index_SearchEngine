Research is undertaken in those areas where the\nevidence will lead to the greatest benefits to patients, either through improved patient\noutcomes or the most efficient use of NHS resources.\nThe Standing Group on Health Technology advises on national priorities for health\ntechnology assessment. Six advisory panels assist the Standing Group in identifying \nand prioritising projects. These priorities are then considered by the HTA Commissioning\nBoard supported by the National Coordinating Centre for HTA (NCCHTA).\nThis report is one of a series covering acute care, diagnostics and imaging, methodology,\npharmaceuticals, population screening, and primary and community care. It was identified\nas a priority by the Acute Sector Panel.\nThe views expressed in this publication are those of the authors and not necessarily those\nof the Standing Group, the Commissioning Board, the Panel members or the Department\nof Health. The editors wish to emphasise that funding and publication of this research by\nthe NHS should not be taken as implicit support for the recommendations for policy\ncontained herein. In particular, policy options in the area of screening will, in England, \nbe considered by the National Screening Committee. This Committee, chaired by the\nChief Medical Officer, will take into account the views expressed here, further available\nevidence and other relevant considerations.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the\nsearch, appraisal and synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in\ntheory, permit the replication of the review by others.\nSeries Editors:  Andrew Stevens, Ruairidh Milne and Ken Stein\nAssistant Editors: Jane Robertson \nThe editors have tried to ensure the accuracy of this report but cannot accept \nresponsibility for any errors or omissions.

The meaning is usually clear from \nthe context but a glossary is provided for the non-specialist reader. In some cases usage differs in the\nliterature but the term has a constant meaning throughout this review. \nAcute renal failure  The usually sudden and\npotentially reversible loss of renal function.\nAllocative efficiency  This type of efficiency is\naddressed by cost\u2013benefit analysis. It is about\nachieving the optimal allocation of resources\nacross all possible uses of such resources.\nTherefore, if an intervention is shown to \nbe more effective and more costly than an\nalternative, a decision has to be taken as to\nwhether the extra cost is justified in terms of\nimproved effectiveness; that is, will the input\nof more resources to that particular area of\ncare enhance allocative efficiency?\nAutomated cycler machine  A device used to\nadminister peritoneal dialysis for a defined\nperiod usually at night time. The patient\nusually needs to make only one connection\nand the automated cycler machine carries out\nthe prescribed dialysis exchanges. A variety of\nautomated cycler machines are available.\nAutomated peritoneal dialysis\n* There are \na number of new technologies which are\nadaptations of continuous ambulatory peri-\ntoneal dialysis and which have the potential \nto improve quality of life for some patients.\nThese include intermittent peritoneal dialysis,\ncontinuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis and night-\ntime intermittent peritoneal dialysis. These\nnew technologies require more expensive\ndialysis fluids or dialysis machines or both.\nBlinding (synonym: masking)\n* Keeping \nsecret group assignment (e.g. to treatment or\ncontrol) from the study participants or inves-\ntigators. Blinding is used to protect against the\npossibility that knowledge of assignment may\naffect patient response to treatment, provider\nbehaviours (performance bias) or outcome\nassessment (detection bias). Blinding is not\nalways practical (e.g. when comparing surgery\nto drug treatment).\nThe importance of blinding depends on how\nobjective the outcome measure is; blinding is\nmore important for less objective outcome\nmeasures such as pain or quality of life.\nChronic renal failure* Kidneys slowly destroy-\ned over months or years. To begin with there \nis little to see or find, which means that many\npatients present for medical help very late in\ntheir disease, or even in the terminal stages.\nCochrane Collaboration\n* An international\norganisation that aims to help people make\nwell-informed decisions about health by pre-\nparing, maintaining and ensuring the accessi-\nbility of systematic reviews of the benefits and\nrisks of healthcare interventions.\nCochrane Library\n* A collection of databases,\npublished on disk and CD-ROM and updated\nquarterly, containing the Cochrane Database of\nSystematic Reviews, the Cochrane Controlled\nTrials Register, the Database of Abstracts of\nReviews of Effectiveness, the Cochrane Review\nMethodology Database and information about\nthe Cochrane Collaboration.\nCochrane review\n* A Cochrane review is a\nsystematic, up-to-date summary of reliable\nevidence of healthcare benefits and risks.\nCochrane reviews are intended to help people\nmake practical decisions. For a review to be\ncalled a \u2018Cochrane review\u2019, it must be in the\nparent database maintained by the Cochrane\nCollaboration. This composed of modules of\nreviews submitted by Collaborative Review\nGroups (CRGs) registered with the Cochrane\nCollaboration. The reviews contributed to one\nof the modules making up the parent database\ncontinuedGlossary and list of abbreviations\nii\nare refereed by the editorial team of the CRG,\nas described in the CRG module. Reviewers\nadhere to guidelines published in the Cochrane\nHandbook. The specific methods used in a\nreview are described in the text of the review.\nCochrane reviews are prepared using Review\nManager software provided by the Collabo-\nration and adhere to a structured format that \nis described in the Handbook.\nConcealment of allocation\n* The process used\nto prevent foreknowledge of group assignment\nin an RCT, which should be seen as distinct\nfrom blinding. The allocation process should\nbe impervious to any influence by the indi-\nvidual making the allocation by having the\nrandomisation process administered by some-\none who is not responsible for recruiting par-\nticipants: for example, a hospital pharmacy \nor a central office.\nMethods of assignment such as date of \nbirth and case record numbers (see quasi-\nrandom allocation) are open to manipulation.\nAdequate methods of allocation concealment\ninclude: centralised randomisation schemes;\nrandomisation schemes controlled by a phar-\nmacy; numbered or coded containers in which\ncapsules from identical-looking, numbered\nbottles are administered sequentially; on-site\ncomputer systems, where allocations are in \na locked unreadable file; and sequentially\nnumbered opaque, sealed envelopes.\nConfidence interval* The range within which\nthe \u2018true\u2019 value (e.g. size of effect of an inter-\nvention) is expected to lie with a given degree\nof certainty (e.g. 95% or 99%). Note: Con-\nfidence intervals represent the probability of\nrandom errors but not systematic errors (bias).\nContinuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis*\nIn this technique, dialysis fluid is introduced\ninto and withdrawn from the peritoneal cavity\n(which is around the bowel) via a silastic tube\n(catheter). Waste products are removed from\nthe blood across the peritoneal membrane. The\nfluid is chemically composed to draw or \u2018attract\u2019\nexcess salts and water from the blood to cross\nthe membrane without the blood itself being in\ncontact with the fluid. Dialysis fluid is withdrawn\nfrom the peritoneal cavity after a dwell of \n4\u20135 hours during the day and about 8 hours\novernight and fresh fluid introduced. This\nprocedure, which takes about 20 minutes, is\ncalled an exchange and occurs four times daily.\nContinuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis This \nis a form of peritoneal dialysis in which all\nconnections and preparation of equipment\nusually takes place at bedtime in the privacy \nof the home. To administer it a peritoneal\ncycler is required and the process is usually\ncarried out at night when the patient is asleep.\nIt is called continuous because fluid is usually \nleft in the abdomen during the day. If no\ndialysis fluid is left in the abdomen during \nthe day, it is called nocturnal intermittent\nperitoneal dialysis.\nContinuous data\n* Data with a potentially\ninfinite number of possible values along \na continuum. Height, weight and blood\npressure are examples of continuous variables.\nCost-effectiveness analysis* An economic\nanalysis used to compare effectiveness and cost\nof health interventions in which either:\n\u2022 effects of the interventions are known to be\nequal and so the option to be recommended\nis that which is least (or less) costly (some\ntimes known as \u2018cost-minimisation analysis\u2019); \nor\n\u2022 effects and costs differ across interventions;\nhence, the option to be recommended is\nthat with the lowest (or lower) ratio of cost\nper unit of health gain, as implementation\nof this option will lead to the most (or\nmore) effective use of a fixed budget.\nCreatinine* A natural waste product of muscle\nmetabolism which is normally excreted by the\nkidney. When renal function is reduced the\nlevel of creatinine in the blood rises and the\namount cleared from the kidneys (creatinine\nclearance) falls. These measures are used as \na broad approximation of the prevailing level\nof renal function.\nCrossover trial\n* A type of clinical trial com-\nparing two or more interventions in which the\nparticipants, upon completion of the course of\none treatment, are switched to another. For\nexample, for a comparison of treatments A\nand B, half the participants are randomly\nallocated to receive them in the order A, B\nand half to receive them in the order B, A.\nA problem with this study design is that the\ncontinuedHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\niii\neffects of the first treatment may carry over\ninto the period when the second is given.\nData abstraction  The systematic procedure of\ntranscribing data from included studies. Data\nabstracted typically include a description of the\nintervention, population and setting together\nwith outcomes data.\nDecision analysis\n* A technique used to aid\ndecision-making under conditions of uncer-\ntainty by systematically representing and exam-\nining all of the relevant information for a deci-\nsion and the uncertainty around that informa-\ntion. The available choices are plotted on a\ndecision tree. At each branch, or decision node,\nthe probabilities of each outcome that can be\npredicted are estimated. The relative worth or\npreferences of decision-makers for the various\npossible outcomes for a decision can also be esti-\nmated and incorporated in a decision analysis.\nDichotomous data (synonym: binary data)*\nObservations with two possible categories, \nsuch as dead\/alive, smoker\/non-smoker,\npresent\/non-present.\nEnd-stage renal disease  End-stage renal\ndisease is defined as the last stage in the course\nof renal failure which cannot be controlled by\nconservative management and when the\npatient requires either dialysis or a kidney\ntransplant in order to maintain life.\nExchange  Used in continuous ambulatory\nperitoneal dialysis, this term refers to the\nprocess of draining fluid out of the peritoneal\ncavity and instilling a fresh bag of dialysate into\nthe peritoneal cavity.\nExit site  That site on the skin surface where\nthe peritoneal dialysis catheter exits.\nFixed-effect model* A statistical model that\nstipulates that the units under analysis (e.g.\npeople in a trial or study in a meta-analysis) are\nthe ones of interest, and thus constitute the\nentire population of units. Only within-study\nvariation is taken to influence the uncertainty of\nresults (as reflected in the confidence interval)\nof a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.\nVariation between the estimates of effect from\neach study (heterogeneity) does not affect the\nconfidence interval in a fixed-effect model.\nGrey literature  Refers to literature that is not\nwidely published such as dissertations, theses\nand government reports.\nHaemodialysis  Removal of waste products\nfrom the blood by allowing these products to\ndiffuse across a thin membrane into dialysis\nfluid which is then discarded along with the\ntoxic waste products. The fluid is chemically\ncomposed to draw or \u2018attract\u2019 excess salts and\nwater from the blood to cross the membrane,\nwithout the blood itself being in contact with\nthe fluid. The patient\u2019s circulation is attached\nto a machine through which fluid is passed\nand exchange can take place.\nHeterogeneity\n* In systematic reviews\nheterogeneity refers to variability or differ-\nences between studies in the estimates of\neffects. A distinction is sometimes made\nbetween \u2018statistical heterogeneity\u2019 (differences\nin the reported effects), \u2018methodological het-\nerogeneity (differences in study design) and\n\u2018clinical heterogeneity\u2019 (differences between\nstudies in key characteristics of the participants\ninterventions or outcome measures).\nStatistical tests of heterogeneity are used \nto assess whether the observed variability \nin study results (effect sizes) is greater than\nthat expected to occur by chance. However,\nthese tests have low statistical power (see \nalso homogeneity).\nHomogeneity* In systematic reviews homo-\ngeneity refers to the degree to which the\nresults of studies included in a review are\nsimilar. \u2018Clinical homogeneity\u2019 means that, \nin trials included in a review, the participants\ninterventions and outcome measures are\nsimilar or comparable. Studies are considered\n\u2018statistically homogeneous\u2019 if their results vary\nno more than might be expected by the play of\nchance (see also heterogeneity).\nHyperkalaemia  An abnormally high level of\npotassium in the blood usually defined as\ngreater than 5.0 mmol\/l (the ranges may vary\nfrom laboratory to laboratory).\nIntention-to-treat\n* An intention-to-treat\nanalysis is one in which all the participants \nin a trial are analysed according to the inter-\nvention to which they were allocated, whether\ncontinuedGlossary and list of abbreviations\niv\nthey received it or not. Intention-to-treat\nanalyses are favoured in assessments of effect-\niveness as they mirror the non-compliance \nand treatment changes that are likely to occur\nwhen the intervention is used in practice, and\nbecause of the risk of attrition bias when\nparticipants are excluded from the analysis.\nIntermittent peritoneal dialysis\n* An older but\nstill useful technique of peritoneal dialysis in\nwhich fluid is instilled into the peritoneal\ncavity at regular intervals but for a limited\nperiod. The process may be repeated.\nKt\/V  Measure of dialysis adequacy.\nMarkov model  A Markov process is a tech-\nnique used in decision analysis (see Decision\nanalysis). In a standard decision tree analysis \na patient moves through states, for example,\nfrom not treated to treated to final outcome;\nhowever, in a Markov process a patient would\nmove between states, for example, backwards\nand forwards between continuous ambulatory\nperitoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. There\nare some states, however, that once entered\ncannot be left. These are defined as \u2018absorbing\nstates\u2019 (in models of medical interventions\nsuch states are normally defined as death).\nMembranes* The material used as a filtering\nagent in dialysers. Many are formed from a\ncellulose base, others from synthetic materials\nconstructed in an attempt to adjust the mol-\necular weight of the substances filtered and to\nreduce any reaction in the patient which may\nresult from the contact of blood with the\nmembrane surface.\nMeSH (medical subject headings)\n* A standard\nset of keyboarding terms used by the US\nNational Library of Medicine to index articles\nin Index Medicus and Medline. Designed to\nreduce problems that arise from, for example,\ndifferences in British and American spelling,\nthe MeSH system has a tree structure in which\nbroad subject terms branch into a series of\nprogressively narrower subject terms.\nMeta-analysis\n* The use of statistical\ntechniques in a systematic review to integrate\nthe results of the included studies. Also used\nto refer to systematic reviews that use \nmeta-analysis.\nMethodological quality* (synonyms: validity,\ninternal validity)  The extent to which the\ndesign and conduct of a trial are likely to have\nprevented systematic errors (bias). Variation \nin quality can explain variation on the results\nof trials included in a systematic review. More\nrigorously designed (better \u2018quality\u2019) trials are\nmore likely to yield results that are closer to\nthe \u2018truth\u2019.\nOdds ratio\n* The ratio of the odds of an event\nin the experimental (intervention) group to\nthe odds of an event in the control group.\nOdds are the ratio of the number of people in\na group with an event to the number without\nan event. Thus, if a group of 100 people had\nan event rate of 0.20, the event happened to\n20 people and did not happen to 80, and the\nodds would be 20\/80 or 0.25.\nAn odds ratio of one indicates no difference\nbetween comparison groups. For undesirable\noutcomes an odds ratio of less than one indi-\ncates that the intervention was effective in\nreducing the risk of that outcome. When the\nevent rate is small, odds ratios are very similar\nto relative risks.\nPeritoneal catheter  This is a length of \nstraight or curled silicon rubber or poly-\nurethane tubing with numerous side holes \nat the distal end. Usually one or two Dacron\u00ae\ncuffs are present on the catheter to provoke \na local inflammatory response to anchor the\ncatheter firmly into a subcutaneous tunnel.\nThe catheter itself is placed in the peritoneal\ncatheter by a surgeon or a nephrologist.\nPeritoneal dialysis  A modality of renal replace-\nment therapy in which dialysis is carried out \nby instilling fluid into the potential peritoneal\ncavity through a catheter. The fluid is then\nallowed to remain in the peritoneal cavity for \na time and dialysis occurs by diffusion and by\nultrafiltration. The fluid is then drained out\nand fresh dialysate is instilled into the\nperitoneal cavity to continue the process.\nPeritoneal membrane  A mesothelial\nmembrane which lines the inner wall of the\nabdominal cavity (perietal peritoneum) and\nalso covers the abdominal viscera (visceral\nperitoneum). The membrane is actually a\nheterogeneous series of tissue barriers\ncontinuedHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\nv\nbetween blood and the peritoneal space \nwhich normally contains no free fluid. It \ncan be used for purposes of dialysis as\ndescribed above under peritoneal dialysis.\nPermuted index  Allows exploration in\nMedline of every MeSH term which contains a\nparticular word, for example, all MeSH terms\ncontaining the word \u2018dialysis\u2019 such as\nperitoneal dialysis.\nPeto\u2019s method\n* A way of combining odds\nratios that has become widely used in meta-\nanalysis. The calculations are straightforward\nand understandable but the method produces\nbiased results in some circumstances. It is a\nfixed-effect model.\nProtein catabolic rate  The rate at which\nprotein is catabolised by the body. In patients\nwho are in a steady state, protein catabolic rate\nequals the dietary in take of protein.\nProtocol* The plan or set of steps to be\nfollowed in a study. A protocol for a systematic\nreview should describe the rationale for the\nreview, the objectives and the methods that\nwill be used to locate, select and critically\nappraise studies, and to collect and analyse\ndata from the included studies.\nPruritus  Skin itch.\nQuality assessment  The extent to which the\ndesign and conduct of a trial are likely to have\nprevented systematic errors (bias). Variation in\nquality can explain variation in the results of\ntrials included in a systematic review. More rig-\norously designed (better \u2018quality\u2019) trials are\nmore likely to yield results that are closer to\nthe \u2018truth\u2019.\nQuasi-random allocation\n* A method of\nallocating participants to different forms \nof care that is not truly random, for example,\nallocation by date of birth, day of the week,\nmedical record number, month of the year, or\nthe order in which participants are included in\nthe study (e.g. alternation).\nQuasi-randomised trials\n* A trial using a quasi-\nrandom method of allocating participants to\ndifferent forms of care. There is a greater risk\nof selection bias in quasi-random trials in\nwhich allocation is not adequately concealed\ncompared with randomised controlled trials\nwith adequate allocation concealment.\nRandom allocation\n* A method that uses \nthe play of chance to assign participants to\ncomparison groups in a trial, for example, by\nusing a random numbers table or a computer-\ngenerated random sequence. Random allo-\ncation implies that each individual or unit\nbeing entered into a trial has the same chance\nof receiving each of the possible interventions.\nIt also implies that the probability that an indi-\nvidual will receive a particular intervention is\nindependent of the probability that any other\nindividual will receive the same intervention.\nRandom effects\n* A statistical model some-\ntimes used in meta-analysis, in which both\nwithin-study sampling error (variance) and\nbetween-studies variation are included in the\nassessment of the uncertainty (or confidence\ninterval) of the results of a meta-analysis (see\nFixed-effect model). If there is significant\nheterogeneity among the results of the\nincluded studies, random-effects models \nwill give wider confidence intervals than \nfixed-effect models.\nRandomisation* Method used to generate \na random allocation sequence, such as using\ntables of random numbers or computer-\ngenerated random sequences. The method \nof randomisation should be distinguished\nfrom concealment of allocation because \nof the risk of selection bias, despite the use \nof randomisation, if there is not adequate\nallocation concealment.\nFor instance, a list of random numbers may \nbe used to randomise participants but, if the\nlist is open to the individuals responsible for\nrecruiting and allocating participants, those\nindividuals can influence the allocation\nprocess, either knowingly or unknowingly.\nRandomised controlled trial (synonym:\nrandomised clinical trial)\n* An experiment in\nwhich investigators randomly allocate eligible\npeople into groups (e.g. treatment and con-\ntrol) to receive or not to receive one or more\ninterventions that are being compared. The\nresults are assessed by comparing outcomes \nin the treatment and control groups.\ncontinuedGlossary and list of abbreviations\nvi\nReference Manager\n* A software package\ndesigned to manage bibliographic references.\nSometimes confusingly referred to as RefMan\n(see RevMan). Examples of other similar\npackages are Papyrus and ProCite.\nReview Manager* Software developed for the\nCochrane Collaboration to assist reviewers in\npreparing Cochrane reviews. Reviewers enter\ntheir protocols and reviews into RevMan, from\nwhich they can be imported into ModMan by\na Collaborative Review Group coordinator for\ninclusion in the parent database and the\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews \nas part of the Group\u2019s edited module.\nReview protocol  see Protocol.\nSearch strategy\n*\n(1) The methods used by a Collaborative\nReview Group registered with the Cochrane\nCollaboration to identify trials within the\nGroup\u2019s scope. This includes handsearching\nrelevant journals, searching electronic data-\nbases, contacting drug companies, other\nforms of personal contact and checking refer-\nence lists. Groups must describe their search\nstrategy in detail in their module. Reviewers\ncan refer to the Group\u2019s search strategy when\npreparing a Cochrane Review and, if neces-\nsary, supplement this with a description of\ntheir own additional searches.\n(2) The methods used by a reviewer to locate\nrelevant studies, including the use of a\nCollaborative Review Group\u2019s trials register.\n(3) The combination of terms used to identify\nstudies on an electronic database such as\nMedline.\nSerum urea  Urea has a molecular weight of\n67 and is a product of metabolism of amino\nacid. The normal serum concentration of \nurea is 4\u20136.6 mmol\/l. A high serum urea\nconcentration is seen in patients with renal\nfailure but may also be seen in patients \nwith gastrointestinal haemorrhage \nand dehydration.\nSystematic review (Synonym: systematic\noverview)\n* A review of a clearly formulated\nquestion that uses systematic and explicit\nmethods to identify, select and critically\nappraise relevant research, and to collect \nand analyse data from the studies that are\nincluded in the review. Statistical methods\n(meta-analysis) may or may not be used to\nanalyse and summarise the results of the\nincluded studies (see also Cochrane review).\nTechnical efficiency  Whereas an allocative\nefficiency perspective addresses the question\nof whether to carry out or expand an activity,\ntechnical efficiency addresses the issue of how\nbest to undertake an activity once a decision\nhas been made to carry it out. Strictly, tech-\nnical efficiency is ensuring the production \nof a given output with less of one input and\nno more of other inputs. Cost-effectiveness,\nwhich is about minimising the costs of a given\noutput, implies technical efficiency.\nTransfer sets  In continuous ambulatory\nperitoneal dialysis, a solution container is\nconnected to the patient\u2019s peritoneal dialysis\ncatheter by a length of plastic tubing called \na transfer set. There are two types of transfer\nsets, each requiring a different method of\nperforming the exchange. These can be\nclassified into straight transfer sets and the \nY-transfer set.\nTunnel infections  Those which occur in the\ntunnel portion of catheters. In peritoneal\ndialysis catheters, tunnel infections usually\nrequire removal and replacement of catheter.\nWeighted mean difference (in meta-analysis)\n*\nA method of meta-analysis used to combine\nmeasures on continuous scales (such as\nheight), where the mean, standard deviation\nand sample size in each group are known. \nThe weight given to each study (e.g. how\nmuch influence each study has on the overall\nresults of the meta-analysis) is determined by\nthe precision of its estimate of effect and, in\nthe statistical software in RevMan and the\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, \nis equal to the inverse of the variance. This\nmethod assumes that all of the trials have\nmeasure the outcome on the same scale.\n* Reproduced with permission from The Cochrane\nCollaboration Handbook, v. 3.0, December 1996, \nand the Renal Purchasing Guidelines, NHS\nExecutive, May 1996.\ncontinuedHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\nvii\nList of abbreviations\nACE angiotensin converting enzyme\nBCM biocompatible*\nBICM bio-incompatible\n*\nBPH benign prostatic hyperplasia\nBUN blood urea nitrogen\n*\nCAPD continuous ambulatory \nperitoneal dialysis\nCCPD continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis\nCCT controlled clinical trial\nCI confidence interval\nEPO erythropoietin\nESRD end-stage renal disease\nHDL high-density lipoprotein\nLDL low-density lipoprotein\nNNT numbers-needed-to-treat\nOR odds ratio\nPCR protein catabolic rate\nPKD polycystic kidney disease\nPMMA polymethylmethacrylate\nRCT randomised controlled \n(clinical) trial\nRRT renal replacement therapy\nSD standard deviation*\nSEM standard error of the mean\nUFc ultrafiltration coefficient\nURR urea reduction ratio\nWMD weighted mean difference\n* Used in figures and tablesHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\nix\nObjectives\n\u2022 To review systematically the literature on six\nmajor topics in dialysis therapy for patients \nwith end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n\u2022 To link clinical effectiveness with cost (resource\nuse) in an economic analysis to assess efficiency.\n\u2022 To suggest implications for clinical practice and\npolicy needs.\n\u2022 To indicate areas for further research.\nMethods\nCochrane Collaboration methods were adopted\nand are described in detail in the full report.\nResults\nAbout 16,000 abstracts were considered and about\n2300 possible randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\nrelevant to ESRD (excluding transplantation)\nidentified; 537 were relevant to the six topics and\nonly 47 actually met the eligibility criteria and were\nincluded in the review. A total of 820 papers were\nused for the economic evaluation.\n1.Synthetic compared with cellulose-\nbased membranes in haemodialysis\ntreatment for ESRD\nThe inclusion criteria were met by 22 studies. The\nincidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly\nless with synthetic than with cellulose membranes.\nPredialysis b2 microglobulin concentrations were\nsignificantly lower with high-flux synthetic mem-\nbranes. In a 6-year study, the incidence of amyloid\ndisease was less with high-flux synthetic membranes.\nPlasma triglyceride was lower with synthetic high-\nflux membranes (one study) and serum albumin\nwas higher. Whether the differences were attri-\nbutable to the membrane material or to the flux is\nunclear. There was no other significant difference.\nWhen compared with modified cellulose mem-\nbranes, the incidence of pruritus was less with\nsynthetic membranes. The additional benefits \nof synthetic membranes were achieved at \nadditional cost.\n2.Bicarbonate-buffered compared \nwith acetate-buffered dialysate in\nhaemodialysis treatment for ESRD\nThe inclusion criteria were met by 18 studies.\nThere was a significant reduction with bicarbonate\ndialysis in the number of haemodialysis treatments\ncomplicated by headaches, nausea\/vomiting,\nsymptomatic hypotension and non-specific intoler-\nance. There was no clear evidence of improved\ncardiovascular stability, lipid profile or biochemical\nindicators of renal bone disease. Economic evalu-\nation showed the cost of the self-mix bicarbonate\nbuffer to be similar to that of acetate.\n3.Short-duration compared with\nstandard-duration haemodialysis \nfor ESRD\nOne study with 165 patients was identified. It com-\npared \u2264 3.5 hours dialysis with > 3.5 hours dialysis\nthree times a week. There was no significant differ-\nence in mortality. Hospitalisation rates were greater\nin the short-duration group. There was no conclusive\ndifference in the incidence of intradialytic adverse\nsymptoms between the groups. Blood pressure con-\ntrol was worse in the short-duration group. There was\ninsufficient evidence to judge relative efficiency.\n4.Continuous ambulatory peritoneal\ndialysis (CAPD) delivery systems:\nY-set\/modified Y-set versus standard\nspike as treatment for ESRD\nSix studies met the inclusion criteria. The number\nof patients with at least one episode of peritonitis\nwas significantly lower in patients using Y-set\ndelivery systems. All but one study demonstrated \na significant increase in the number of months per\nepisode of peritonitis with the Y-set delivery systems.\nAll studies showed a significant increase in the time\nto first episode of peritonitis with the Y-set system.\nThere was no significant reduction in the number\nof patients who suffered exit-site infections or\ntunnel infections with the Y-set system. No study\naddressed technique failure. Benefits are\nachievable at extra cost.\n5.Continuous cycler-assisted peritoneal\ndialysis (CCPD) compared with CAPD\nas treatment for ESRD\nOne study of 82 patients met the inclusion criteria.\nThere were no significant differences in the num-\nExecutive summaryx\nber of patients with peritonitis, catheter exit-site\ninfections or catheter tunnel infections. The mean\nnumber of peritonitis episodes per patient per year\nwas significantly lower with CCPD. There was no\nsignificant difference in Kt\/V, six-monthly serum\ncreatinine, urea or phosphate. Fewer patients on\nCCPD needed to change dialysis technique but this\nwas not statistically significant. Patient preference\ncould not be adequately assessed because of the\nparallel group trial design. The estimated cost per\nepisode of peritonitis avoided is considerable.\n6.Haemodialysis compared with CAPD \nas treatment for ESRD\nNo relevant RCTs were identified. Because of the\npoor quality of the study designs used to obtain\nprimary data for economic analyses, it is not possi-\nble to judge whether any assumed extra benefits\nprovided by haemodialysis are worth any extra \ncosts that may be incurred.\nConclusions\nImplications for policy\n\u2022 The moderate benefits of high-flux synthetic\nmembranes are currently achieved at additional\ncost. For general use, cellulose (particularly\nmodified cellulose) membranes are appropriate.\nSynthetic membranes may be appropriate for\npatients experiencing persistent nausea and\nvomiting and for patients likely to be treated by\nhaemodialysis for many years. The price of high-\nflux synthetic membranes is likely to fall in the\nfuture and policy recommendations should be\nkept under review.\n\u2022 Bicarbonate dialysis is preferable to acetate dialysis\nfor the haemodialysis of patients with ESRD,\nproducing fewer unwanted effects at a similar cost.\n\u2022 There is no evidence that reduced dialysis\nduration (\u2264 3.5 hours three times per week)\ndecreases mortality and it may increase\nmorbidity. If reduced dialysis duration regimens\nare implemented on the basis of patient pre-\nference or assumed lower cost, their unproven\nsafety should be explicitly acknowledged.\n\u2022 Y-set delivery systems significantly reduce the\nincidence of peritonitis. Given that recurrent\nperitonitis is a major cause of technique failure,\nthe additional cost is likely to be justified.\n\u2022 CCPD showed benefit in one patient outcome but\nis more expensive than CAPD. It is suggested that\nCCPD should only be offered as an alternative to\nCAPD, at present, to patients for whom there is a\nspecific indication.\n\u2022 Data are not available to allow reliable\nconclusions to be drawn about the relative\neffectiveness and efficiency of haemodialysis \nand CAPD.\n\u2022 Dialysis for ESRD intrudes greatly into people\u2019s\ndaily lives. Informed patient preference, based on\nevidence of effectiveness and efficiency, should be\ntaken into account when policy is decided.\nRecommendations for research\n\u2022 Further multicentre pragmatic RCTs with\neconomic evaluations concentrating on primary\noutcomes of major importance to patients are\nrequired to compare the different dialysis mem-\nbranes available. These should take into account\nmembrane reuse, their properties, including flux\nand material, and should include modified cellu-\nlose and low-flux synthetic membranes which\nmay be less expensive than their high-flux\ncounterparts. The trials should include older\npatients and those with comorbid illnesses.\n\u2022 A large multicentre pragmatic RCT comparing\nhaemodialysis treatment duration policies is\nrequired. Such a trial should include the longer\nduration haemodialysis practised in other parts\nof Europe, have minimum exclusion criteria, \na long follow-up period and minimum data\ncollection, concentrating primarily on patient\nmorbidity and mortality.\n\u2022 More evidence of the effect on patient outcomes\nand costs of technique failure would further\ninform the decision about the use of Y-set systems.\n\u2022 Further RCTs with economic evaluations are\nrequired comparing CCPD with CAPD, with\nparticular reference to peritonitis, technique\nfailure rates and patient preference. Studies are\nalso required to compare CCPD with haemo-\ndialysis to determine whether it is efficient to\nprovide CCPD for those patients who have a\nrelative contraindication to CAPD and who\nwould otherwise be treated by haemodialysis.\n\u2022 The issue facing the health services is not\nwhether to have CAPD or haemodialysis but\nrather the balance of provision between the two\nmodalities. International variations in usage\nshow that a large proportion of patients requir-\ning dialysis for ESRD could be managed initially\nwith either CAPD or haemodialysis. Information\nis required about the relative costs, benefits and\nrisks of policies of starting with one or other\nmodality. Information on benefits, risks and costs\nshould come from a pragmatic RCT of policies\nbased on starting with CAPD or haemodialysis.\n\u2022 Further systematic reviews are required in \nother aspects of dialysis where there are \npractice options. \n\u2022 The results of the on-going large American study\n(HEMO) should be taken into account when the\nresearch agenda is decided.\nExecutive summaryHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n1\nT\nhe authors were commissioned under the \nNHS Executive Research and Development\nProgramme to undertake a systematic literature\nreview of the effectiveness of dialysis therapy for\nend-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are many\npoints in the management of patients on dialysis\nwhere choices require to be made. Using a dialysis\ndecision tree, six of them were selected in which\nthere were known variations in practice and in\nwhich there were likely to be significant resource\nimplications. Six reviews were undertaken by a\nmultidisciplinary team of clinicians, health services\nresearchers experienced in carrying out literature\nreviews and health economists using the standard-\nised format of the Cochrane Collaboration. There\nis currently no agreed arrangement for incorpor-\nating economic analyses into Cochrane reviews;\nhowever, these have been added to each review and\ntheir findings included in the overall conclusions\nand summaries. A summary of the results of all\nreviews is given in chapter 4 and the full reviews,\nincluding the economic analyses, are included \nas appendices 4\u20139.\nBackground\nWhen people with irreversible loss of kidney\nfunction reach that point in the course of their\nillness when their kidneys fail to support life, they\nare said to have ESRD. The only way in which they\ncan then be kept alive is by renal replacement\ntherapy (RRT). There are two types of RRT, dialysis\nand transplantation. Those needing RRT are likely\nto move between the various modalities of treat-\nment; for example, they may begin with haemo-\ndialysis, move to continuous ambulatory peritoneal\ndialysis (CAPD), receive a renal transplant, and\nthen return to haemodialysis if transplantation fails.\nAlthough transplantation is the treatment of\nchoice, the number of donor kidneys is limited \nand hence many patients require long-term or \neven life-long dialysis. Such therapy is not only\nassociated with considerable morbidity and a\nsignificantly impaired quality of life but also\nimposes a major economic burden on the health\nservice. In recent years, the number of patients\naccepted for dialysis in the UK has increased. In \nthe UK in 1982, an average of 20 patients per\nmillion of the population started dialysis.1 This\nfigure is now about 80 patients per million and \nwill almost certainly rise further, particularly in\nareas where ethnic minorities comprise a high\nproportion of the population.2\u20134 As the number of\npatients receiving RRT increases, there is increased\npressure to spend more on renal services and this\nis, quite rightly, raising concerns about the effect-\niveness and efficiency of current provision.\nMethods of dialysis\nDialysis removes fluid, electrolytes and toxins \nthat the failed kidney cannot excrete. It also allows\nbuffering of the blood with alkali as the kidney can\nno longer correct the body\u2019s tendency to acidity. A\nfuller explanation is given in appendix 1. There are\ntwo principal modes of dialysis for patients with\nESRD \u2013 haemodialysis and CAPD.\nHaemodialysis\nThe artificial kidney (dialyser) used in haemo-\ndialysis contains a semi-permeable membrane;\ndialysis relies on the fact that small molecules such\nas urea and creatinine, which are usually excreted\nby the kidney, can pass across this membrane down\na concentration gradient. Removal of fluid from\nblood is achieved by applying hydrostatic pressure\nacross the membrane and acidosis is corrected by\nacetate or bicarbonate in the dialysis fluid (dialy-\nsate) that flows on the other side of the membrane.\nThis procedure requires permanent easy access to\nthe patient\u2019s circulation which is usually obtained\nby creating an arteriovenous fistula in the arm.\nSeveral types of dialysers, dialysates and \u2018dialysis\nmachines\u2019 which monitor the procedure are\ncommercially available, and the frequency and\nduration of dialysis sessions, dialyser membranes,\ndialysate composition and dialysis schedules vary\nfrom centre to centre. Haemodialysis can be\ncarried out in the patient\u2019s home or in a satellite\nunit run by nursing staff, as well as in a large\nhospital dialysis unit.\nCAPD and CCPD\nThe human peritoneal membrane is semi-\npermeable and, hence, can be used as a dialysis\nmembrane. In CAPD, using the peritoneal mem-\nbrane in this way requires a permanent catheter \nto be inserted in the abdomen through which \nthe dialysing fluid (dialysate) is passed into the\nChapter 1\nIntroductionIntroduction\n2\nperitoneal cavity. The small molecules normally\nexcreted by the kidney, such as urea and creatinine,\npass across the peritoneal membrane down a con-\ncentration gradient. Removal of fluid relies on an\nosmotic gradient across the membrane and this is\ncreated by using varying concentrations of glucose\nor carbohydrate polymer (Icodextrin) in the\ndialysis fluid. The dialysate is left in the peritoneal\ncavity for 6\u20138 hours to allow equilibration and then\ndrained out and replaced with fresh fluid. Thus,\nperitoneal dialysis does not require a machine and\ncan be carried out by patients in their own homes.\nSeveral types of catheter and dialysis fluid are avail-\nable commercially and a range of management\nregimens have been advocated. Continuous cyclic\nperitoneal dialysis (CCPD) is a modification of\nCAPD in which the exchanges are performed\novernight by a machine. Recently it has been\nproposed as an alternative to CAPD.\nVariation in dialysis practice\nDespite the marked differences between haemo-\ndialysis and CAPD there are surprisingly wide inter-\nand intra-national variations in the use of the two\napproaches. In part, this seems to reflect differing\nperceptions of the role of CAPD as an alternative to\nhaemodialysis. In the 1980s, the criteria for accept-\ning patients for dialysis in the UK were broadened,\nand older patients and those with co-morbid\nillnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes, were\naccepted for treatment. This coincided with the\nintroduction of CAPD. In the UK, CAPD was seen\nas a way of allowing the treatment of an increasing\nnumber of patients without the need to create\nmore haemodialysis facilities, purchase expensive\nmachines and employ large numbers of highly\ntrained staff. Currently in the UK, about 50% \nof new patients beginning dialysis are treated by\nCAPD; this contrasts with other countries, such \nas France, Germany, Italy and the USA, where\nCAPD is used in less than 20% of patients.\nIn certain patients it may not be possible to offer\nboth types of dialysis therapy; those who have had\nextensive abdominal surgery, for example, may only\nbe suitable for haemodialysis and those in whom\nthe creation of vascular access has become impos-\nsible may be restricted to CAPD. Such medical\nissues, however, apply to a relatively small number\nof patients and, in the majority of cases, the choice\nof dialysis modality made by health personnel and\/\nor the patient is based on non-medical factors.\n5\nOutside the UK, the strongest determinant may \nbe the higher levels of reimbursement associated\nwith haemodialysis enjoyed by both the physician\nand dialysis facility.6 In the UK, factors which may\ninfluence the choice include the distance of \na patient\u2019s home from the renal unit and the\npresence of co-morbid illnesses.\nOnce these factors have been taken into account, \nit is generally considered by nephrologists in the\nUK that informed patient choice should be the\nmajor factor in influencing the selection of treat-\nment modality, although, in fact, the decision is\noften influenced by the current availability of local\nfacilities. Furthermore, the wide variation in dialy-\nsis practice is not limited to the choice between\nhaemodialysis and CAPD. Once the decision to use\nhaemodialysis has been made, selection of mem-\nbranes, dialysis fluids and treatment protocols also\nvary, as do the choice of catheters, fluids and\nschedules for CAPD.\nThese variations may hide important differences\nwithin the range of approaches used for dialysis. All\napproaches to dialysis are associated with consider-\nable morbidity and impose major restrictions on the\nlifestyles of those being treated. Dietary and fluid\nrestrictions, dependence on dialysis technology for\nsurvival, and limits on ability to work and to travel,\ncause major stresses affecting the quality of life of\nboth patients and their families, and it is important\nto assess, in as unbiased a way as possible, how such\neffects vary across dialysis approaches.\nCosts of dialysis therapy\nDialysis therapy already consumes considerable\nhealth service resources and, as indicated above, \nas the number of patients likely to be treated each\nyear increases, the stock of patients will rise, result-\ning in increasing pressure to spend more on renal\nservices. The number of people on RRT (dialysis\nand transplantation) will increase until there is equi-\nlibrium between the numbers being accepted for\ntreatment and the numbers dying. The number on\ndialysis will increase as a proportion of those treated\nif there is a shortage of kidney donors or if older\npeople on RRT, especially those with co-morbid ill-\nnesses, are thought unsuitable for a renal transplant.\nDifferences in costs between alternative approaches\nmay therefore be very important. It has been\nestimated that when the rising number of dialysis\npatients reaches a plateau, 0.08% of the total num-\nber of patients will be consuming between 2% and\n4% of the health budget.\n7 A recent review, however,\nhighlighted the variation in estimated costs of dialy-\nsis in the UK. The authors of one of the reports\ncited estimated the annual cost per patient to be\n\u00a318,000 for hospital haemodialysis and \u00a313,000 for\nCAPD whereas, in another report, these costs were\nestimated to be \u00a310,500 and \u00a311,000, respectively.\n8\nIt was suggested in the review that some of these Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n3\ncost variations may have occurred because of local\ndifferences in policies for administering and deliv-\nering dialysis services and differences in method-\nology used in assessing cost; for example, in some\nunits the cost of CAPD fluids and expensive drugs\nsuch as erythropoietin (EPO) may be charged to\ngeneral practitioners\u2019 budgets.\nThe systematic review\nIt was against this background of increasing\npressure on resources and wide variations in\npractice that this systematic review of dialysis for\nESRD was commissioned. We chose to address the\nissue in two complementary ways. Firstly, the aim\nwas to review evidence of clinical effectiveness in\nterms of benefits and risks. Secondly, it was planned\nto link effectiveness with costs (resource use) in an\neconomic analysis to assess efficiency. From the\noutset it was recognised that the choices were often\nnot simply between one approach and another but\nrather between different policies, reflecting the fact\nthat it may be good management in some circum-\nstances to change from one technique to another.\nThus, for example, the choice between haemo-\ndialysis and CAPD is a planning decision about\nwhich technique to use first, while recognising \nthat it may be appropriate to switch to the\nalternative later.\nThe choice of questions addressed\nTo ensure that the review focused on the most\nimportant questions in dialysis, a \u2018dialysis decision\ntree\u2019 was developed (Figure 1).\nSix points in the management of patients on\ndialysis were selected when major choices were\nmade, at which there were known to be variations\nin practice and for which there were likely to be\nsignificant resource implications (Table 1).\nThe topics for systematic reviews were chosen by two\nclinical nephrologists, based on recommendations\nfrom the NHS Executive, for two main reasons.\n\u2022 There is wide variation in clinical practice in\neach of the six areas selected both in the UK \nand internationally.\n\u2022 These areas all have important health \neconomic implications.\nIn view of the resources available for this systematic\nreview, both in terms of staffing and time, it was\nconsidered that only these six areas could be\naddressed in this project. There are, of course,\nmany other areas in the management of ESRD by\ndialysis for which there are considerable resource\nimplications and variations in practice. These topics\ncould be considered for future systematic reviews.\nChoice of literature to assess\neffectiveness and efficiency\nThe study concentrated on the evidence from\nrandomised controlled trials (RCTs), even though\nit was suspected that there were likely to be\nrelatively few such reports in the literature. Our\nconcern was that observational studies, even well-\nconducted cohort studies, might be subject to\nselection biases of the same order of magnitude \nas the likely treatment differences.\nIt is now widely accepted that the only way to \navoid such biases is by secure random allocation \nof the alternative approaches to care. The groups\ngenerated then only differ by chance in respect of\nDo we treat at all?\nHow do \nwe treat?\nMembrane\nDialysate\nSetting\nEquipment\nAdequacy\nHD PD\nFrequency\/\nduration\nDialysate\nDelivery\nsystem\nFrequency\nexchange\nVolume \nexchange\nAdequacy\nCAPD\nvs.\nCCPD\nFIGURE 1  Dialysis decision tree (HD,haemodialysis;PD,peritoneal dialysis; ,topics selected for this series of reviews)Introduction\n4\nbaseline prognostic variables. However, even when\nwell-designed, the results of RCTs may still be of\nonly limited value, because few are sufficiently \nlarge for precise enough estimates of treatment\ndifferences to be generated so that chance may be\nruled out as an explanation. To overcome this, our\nplan was to consider the data from all similar trials\nin statistical meta-analysis, wherever possible.\nClearly, potential bias also needed to be minimised\nin the process by which data from comparable trials\nwere brought together and synthesised. Systematic\napproaches to the identification of relevant studies\nand the abstraction of data from relevant reports\nwere therefore used. These are discussed in \ndetail later.\nAlthough information on costs was sought in the\nreports of RCTs, the systematic literature search \nfor the economic analysis within each review was\nextended to identify previously conducted eco-\nnomic evaluations. The use of these data are\ndescribed in detail later.\nChoice of outcome measures\nThe main body of this report has been kept\nsuccinct by limiting it to a summary of activities \nand findings; individual topics are supported by\nappendices in which more detailed information \nis presented on the methods used in, and results \nof, each review topic. After the description of\nresearch methods and the products of the liter-\nature searches, summaries of the six reviews are\nreported with conclusions and recommendations.\nThe report finishes with a discussion of the study.\nThis has resulted in some degree of duplication \nof text but with the aim of ensuring an appropriate\nlevel of detail throughout.\nTABLE 1  Subjects addressed in the systematic reviews\n1 Comparison of synthetic with cellulose-based membranes in haemodialysis treatment for patients with ESRD\n2 Comparison of bicarbonate-buffered dialysate with acetate-buffered dialysate in haemodialysis treatment for patients \nwith ESRD\n3 Comparison of short-duration with standard duration dialysis treatments in haemodialysis treatment for patients \nwith ESRD\n4 Comparison of CAPD delivery systems \u2013 Y-set\/modified Y-set versus standard spike in treatment for patients with ESRD\n5 Comparison of CCPD with CAPD in treatment for patients with ESRD\n6 Comparison of haemodialysis with CAPD as treatment for patients with ESRDHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n5\nIntroduction\nThe methods of the review were based on those\nused by the Cochrane Collaboration9 and the\nCentre for Reviews and Dissemination.10 For\nidentification, synthesis and presentation of the\ndata on clinical effectiveness, the format of the\nCochrane Collaboration was chosen. The prin-\ncipal reason for this decision was that the reviews\nwere based on RCTs, and customised software\n(Review Manager) was available for the preparation\nand analysis of systematic reviews which incorp-\norated statistical programs for meta-analysis, \nwhen appropriate.\nDevelopment of protocols\nA review protocol was formulated for each of the\nsix topics under review. The protocol structure\nfollowed that recommended by the Cochrane\nCollaboration.\n11 Each protocol explicitly described:\n\u2022 the objectives of the review\n\u2022 the clinical and methodological criteria required\nof studies for inclusion\n\u2022 the outcome measures of importance\n\u2022 the search strategy to be used for identification\nof trials\n\u2022 the methods of quality assessment, data\nabstraction and qualitative and quantitative\nsynthesis of results.\nProtocols were then lodged with the Centre for\nReviews and Dissemination in York and entered\ninto Review Manager. Completed protocols for the\nsix topics form the background, objectives, and\nmaterials and methods sections of the reviews\npresented in appendices 4\u20139.\nSearch strategy for the\nidentification of studies for\ninclusion in the systematic review\nFor the reasons outlined in chapter 1, the\nsystematic search for studies of effectiveness was\nlimited to finding RCTs. A broad search strategy\nwas adopted in order to identify as many RCTs as\npossible relevant to the management of patients\nwith ESRD, and not only those relevant to the \nsix review topics. This broad search served \ntwo purposes.\n1. It avoided potential duplication of work which\nwould have followed if separate searches had\nbeen performed for each selected topic.\n2. It allowed the establishment of a register of RCTs\nrelevant to the management of ESRD which we\nand\/or others can use when performing future\nsystematic reviews in this area. (A Cochrane\nRenal Review Group has recently been estab-\nlished and the register will contribute to the\nwork of that Group.)\nSystematic electronic bibliographic\ndatabase searching\nFive electronic databases were searched\nsystematically:\n\u2022 Medline (National Library of Medicine, USA:\nthe electronic version of Index Medicus) using the\nsearch software Ovid, CD Plus\n\u2022 Embase (Elsevier Science Publishers BV, The\nNetherlands: the electronic version of Excerpta\nMedica) using BIDS (on-line)\n\u2022 CINAHL (CINAHL Information Systems, USA \u2013\nCitation Index of the Nursing and Allied Health\nLiterature) using the search software Ovid, \nCD Plus\n\u2022 Biosis (Biological Abstracts Inc., USA: the\nelectronic version of Biological Abstracts) using\nthe search software SilverPlatter\n\u2022 Cochrane Library (Cochrane Collaboration, UK:\nUpdate Software, April 1996; Issue 1, CD-ROM\nversion \u2013 available from BMJ Publishing \nGroup, London).\nMedline was the first electronic bibliographic\ndatabase to be searched. At this time, most search\nstrategy development work by the UK Cochrane\nCentre had been carried out on Medline using\nSilverPlatter search software.\n12 We modified this\nstrategy for use on Medline (on Ovid, CD Plus) to\nallow for the different syntax used by the different\nsearch software.\nThe Cochrane search strategy has three compon-\nents, each succeeding part being less specific but\nmore sensitive than the one previous; the first is\nChapter 2\nReview methods for assessing effectivenessReview methods for assessing effectiveness\n6\nrelatively specific but insensitive, the last most\nsensitive but least specific. Pilot searches indicated\nthat the third component did little to improve the\nnumber of relevant trials identified but generated\nvery large numbers of abstracts describing studies\nusing other types of research design; for this\nreason, we limited the search to the two initial com-\nponents plus the textword search term \u2018volunteer$\u2019\nin title and abstract (as now recommended by the\nUK Cochrane Centre; \u2018volunteer$\u2019 was the only\nterm in the third part of the Cochrane search strat-\negy that increased the number of RCTs identified\nwithout producing a large number of irrelevant\nabstracts). The Cochrane search strategy was com-\nbined with additional search terms describing the\nmanagement of ESRD (see appendix 2). These\nwere developed by a nephrologist and a research\nfellow experienced in literature searching, in line\nwith the decision to perform a broad search cover-\ning all aspects of ESRD rather than perform indi-\nvidual searches for each of the review topics. These\nESRD search terms were built up by investigating\nthe MeSH terms, using the MeSH tree with scope \nnotes and permuted index, as well as by textword\nsearching (searching for terms in the title \nand abstract).\nAs new search terms were added to the search\nstrategy, the first 50 references were scanned to\nassess their relevance to ESRD and dialysis; terms\nthat retrieved only irrelevant articles were further\nmodified or rejected. The final search strategy\nadopted for the Medline search is presented in\nappendix 2.\nThis search strategy was modified for searching\nother databases by changing the syntax to suit that\nof the relevant search software and interrogating\nthe thesaurus or indices of each database to iden-\ntify equivalents of the MeSH terms (i.e. the data-\nbase controlled language). The definitive search\nstrategies which were used to search Embase,\nCINAHL, Biosis and the Cochrane Library are \nalso presented in appendix 2.\nOther databases searched\nThe following databases were also searched. The\nsearch strategies are presented in appendix 2.\n\u2022 Chemabs (Chemical Abstracts Service, USA: \nthe electronic version of Chemical Abstracts) using\nSTN. An on-line search, performed by a librarian\nexperienced in use of this database, was focused\non one of the review topics, acetate versus\nbicarbonate dialysate buffer.\n\u2022 SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Liter-\nature in Europe, compiled by EAGLE) using\nSilverPlatter, CD-ROM version. SIGLE was search-\ned, in an attempt to identify RCTs in the grey\nliterature in this field, by an experienced infor-\nmation officer at the Grampian Health Board.\n\u2022 CRIB (Current Research in Britain, 10th edition,\n1995; published by Cartermill Publications,\nLondon). This was searched in order to identify\non-going trials in the field of dialysis and ESRD.\nAuthors of on-going trials relevant to the six\nchosen topics were contacted to ascertain if \nthe study was an RCT.\n\u2022 NRR (National Research Register, 14th\nconsolidation, September 1996). The aim was \nto identify on-going trials in the field of dialysis\nand ESRD. Authors of on-going trials relevant \nto the six topics were contacted to ascertain if\nthe study was randomised.\nHandsearching of specific journals\nExperience of systematic reviews in other areas of\nhealth care has shown that despite rigorous search-\ning of electronic bibliographic databases as in this\nreview, a significant proportion of relevant RCTs\nare missed because of poor indexing.\n11 Hence, \na large number of journals are currently being\nhandsearched as part of the Cochrane Collabora-\ntion\u2019s effort. The products of these searches are\nbeing made available through retrospective tagging\nin Medline and in the Cochrane Register of RCTs\nin the Cochrane Library. Any trials relevant to\nthose reviews already found in this way by the Coch-\nrane Collaboration should have been identified\nthrough the searches described above. Current\nhandsearching, however, within the Cochrane\nCollaboration does not cover the majority of\njournals, particularly those in specialised areas.\nAccording to the Baltimore Cochrane Center,\nwhich coordinates handsearching activities world-\nwide, as of 6 May 1997, Clinical Nephrology and\nHellenic Nephrology are the only nephrology journals\ncurrently being handsearched outside Aberdeen.\nOnly limited handsearching was possible within \nthe resources available. Kidney International was\nchosen as the nephrology journal most likely to\ncontain relevant RCTs; it is one of the main inter-\nnational nephrology journals and one of the most\nwidely cited of all medical journals, and is held in\nthe local medical school library. Full-text searching\nof Kidney International (including supplements)\nfrom January 1988 to December 1995 was \ntherefore undertaken.\nEach issue of Kidney International was fully searched\nand each original article found was read to the\npoint where it was possible to make a definite classi-\nfication of the study design. Conference abstracts,Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n7\nwith the exception of those listed in appendix 3)\nwere not searched. This decision was taken after\nhandsearching the conference proceedings for \n1 year and extrapolating the figures over 15 years\n(approximately 9000 abstracts). For those abstracts\nrelevant to the six topics, confirmation of subse-\nquent publication and\/or contacting authors for\nfurther details would have been required and it \nwas decided that time and resources did not allow\nfor this. Handsearching was performed by two\nmembers of the team, one a nephrologist and \nthe other a methodologist.\nA quality assurance control was implemented \nand a \u2018gold-standard\u2019 search was devised. The \n1990 and 1995 volumes of Kidney International were\nsearched by both handsearchers separately. After\ndiscussion an agreed attribution of all studies was\nmade \u2013 this was the gold standard. A sensitivity and\nprecision of greater than 90% was required of \neach searcher.\nIn keeping with the philosophy and practice of \nthe Cochrane Collaboration, the aim of this hand-\nsearching was to identify all possible RCTs and\ncontrolled clinical trials (CCTs) regardless of\nsubject content. Details of all such trials identified\nwill be sent to the Cochrane Renal Review Group\nand to the Baltimore Cochrane Center, which is\nresponsible for the Cochrane register of RCTs and\nfor liaising with the National Library of Medicine \nfor retrospective indexing on Medline.\nOther methods of ascertainment \nof RCTs\nReference lists of selected articles\nThe reference lists of other reviews (expert\/\nnarrative), of identified RCTs and of relevant book\nchapters on the topics of interest were checked for\npossible RCTs. These searches were limited to \u2018first\ngeneration\u2019 references only; in other words, the\nreference lists of reports of studies originally\nidentified from a previous reference list search\nwere not searched (appendix 3).\nOther experts in the field\nThe authors of trials included in each systematic\nreview and those from whom clarification of\nmethodology had been sought were contacted to\nascertain if they knew of any other possibly relevant\nRCTs. An example of the letter and associated\nforms sent to authors is presented in appendix 10.\nBiomedical companies \nWhere relevant, biomedical companies were\ncontacted for details of any other relevant \npossible RCTs, published or unpublished.\nIdentification of possible RCTs\nAll possible RCTs were electronically imported or\nmanually entered into the reference managing\nsoftware package, Reference Manager (v. 6.01N,\nResearch Information Systems, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\nSubject keywords and source of article were added.\nRegister of possible RCTs\nAll electronically derived abstracts and study titles\nwere read by a team of three nephrologists to assess\nsubject relevance. Initially, all abstracts were read by\nboth a nephrologist and a methodologist; however,\nbecause of the high degree of concurrence, the\ngreater speed at which the abstract could be assessed\nby the nephrologists and the large number of\nabstracts to be read (about 12,000), it was decided\nthat the nephrologists alone should assess the\nabstracts. Each of three nephrologists was given up\nto 800 abstracts at a time and used a standard form\n(see appendix 10) to identify those abstracts judged\nto be possible RCTs or quasi-RCTs related to the\nmanagement of ESRD. All possible RCTs or quasi-\nRCTs relevant to the six selected topics were\nassigned specific topic keywords on Reference\nManager and the full published paper was obtained.\nQuality assessment of studies\nFull copies of studies were independently assessed\nfor subject relevance, eligibility and methodological\nquality by a nephrologist and a methodologist using\na standard form (see appendix 10). The quality of\nrandom allocation was recorded, including conceal-\nment of allocation, blinding, withdrawals, drop-outs,\nnumbers lost to follow-up and whether intention-to-\ntreat analysis was possible. The assessors were not\nblinded to author, institution or journal. Recent\nevidence suggests that blinding of assessors has a\nrelatively small impact, if any, on the results of a\nmeta-analysis.\n13 Any differences of opinion were\nresolved by discussion. If agreement could not be\nreached, a second double-assessor team, aware of\nthe previous team\u2019s deliberations, reassessed the\nstudy and reached a final decision.\nData abstraction\nA data abstraction form was generated for each\nreview prior to the actual abstraction of the data\nfrom each published paper (see appendix 10).\nOnly comparisons and outcomes that had been\nidentified a priori in the protocols were included.Review methods for assessing effectiveness\n8\nFor each review, the data were abstracted by a\nsingle, medically qualified assessor and then\nentered into Review Manager.\nData analysis\nWhere results from studies could be quantitatively\ncombined, a statistical meta-analysis of the data \nwas undertaken to determine the typical effect \nsize of the intervention. For dichotomous data, \na \u2018typical\u2019 odds ratio (OR) was derived using Peto\u2019s\nmethod14 and, for continuous data, a weighted\nmean difference (WMD) was calculated (weighted\nby the inverse of the variance). Analyses for both\ndichotomous and continuous data adopted a \nfixed effects approach.15 Results from the limited\nnumber of included crossover trials were treated \nin the same fashion as parallel group trials.9\nAll comparisons were framed in terms of unfavour-\nable events, such as adverse symptoms rather than\nfreedom from adverse symptoms. As such, an OR \nof less than one would favour the experimental\ntreatment, and an OR greater than one would\nfavour the control treatment. The 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) were derived for all comparisons.\nMeta-analysis graphs have been presented when\npossible.

In this study, the term \u2018alternative courses\nof action\u2019 can be equated to different ways of\ntreating people with ESRD. Economic evaluation \nis useful for addressing both questions of technical\nefficiency and questions of allocative efficiency.\nCost-effectiveness analysis deals with technical\nefficiency and has been defined by Mooney17 as \nthe technique used to address the question of \nhow to meet a given objective at least cost. Con-\nsideration of allocative efficiency means address-\ning the issue of how many resources to allocate \nto competing healthcare programmes. This\ninvolves making judgements about the relative \nsizes of different healthcare programmes and,\ntherefore, about the relative worth of proposed\nexpansions of such programmes. Such questions\nare addressed by cost\u2013benefit analysis.\nIt may be possible to examine technical and\nallocative efficiency through cost\u2013utility analysis\n(which has the advantage of focusing on the trade-\noff between cost and quality of life). However, we\nhave used the more general frameworks of cost-\neffectiveness and cost\u2013benefit analysis in decision-\nmaking because the nature of the evidence does\nnot lend itself to estimating quality adjusted \nlife-years \u2013 the main outcome measure used \nin cost\u2013utility analysis.\nThe aim of the project was to address questions \nof efficiency as well as effectiveness of alternative\napproaches to dialysis. By deriving and linking\nestimates of the relative costs and effectiveness \nof the procedures under consideration, it \nshould be possible to determine whether one \nprocedure is:\n(i) less costly as well as being at least as effective \nas its comparator, in which case it would be\njudged, unequivocally, to be a better use of\nhealthcare resources (i.e. more technically\nefficient), or\n(ii) more costly, as well as more effective, than \nits comparator, in which case a judgement\nwould have to be made about whether the\nextra cost is worth incurring in terms of the\ngains in health achieved (an allocative\nefficiency question).\nThe manner in which costs and outcome were\nrelated in this study is further developed as an\neconomic framework.\nThe economic framework\nThe manner in which data on costs and clinical\neffectiveness can be brought together to aid in the\njudgement about whether one procedure should\nbe preferred to a comparator is illustrated in more\ndetail in Table 2. These theoretical permutations of\ncost and clinical effectiveness are brought together\nin a matrix in Figure 3.\nFor any procedure the optimum position on \nthe matrix shown in Figure 3 is the square A1, \nwhere an experimental treatment would both \nsave costs and be more effective relative to a com-\nparator. In squares A1, A2 and B1 the procedure \nis more efficient than a comparator and receives \na positive response to the question of whether the\nexperimental treatment is to be preferred. In\nsquares B3, C2, and C3 the procedure is less\nChapter 3\nMethods of economic evaluation\nTABLE 2  Categories of evidence on effectiveness and cost\nCost Effectiveness\nA  Evidence of cost savings 1  Evidence of greater effectiveness\nB  Evidence of no difference in costs 2  Evidence of no difference in effectiveness\nC  Evidence of greater costs 3  Evidence of less effectiveness\nD  Insufficient evidence to judge difference in costs 4  Insufficient evidence to judge difference in effectivenessMethods of economic evaluation\n10\nefficient than the comparator and this receives a\n\u2018negative response. In squares A3 and C1 a judge-\nment is needed as to whether the more costly\nprocedure is worthwhile in terms of extra effec-\ntiveness. Square B2 is neutral with no difference \nin either costs or effectiveness. In those squares\nwith question marks there is insufficient infor-\nmation on cost or effectiveness or both to provide \na definitive answer on relative efficiency.\nAssessment of effectiveness\nThe methods used to assess the relative effective-\nness of the interventions being compared were\ndescribed in chapter 2.\nIdentification of data on resource\nuse and cost\nData collection\nTwo ways of identifying data on resource use and\ncosts were considered. The first was a broad search\nfor relevant studies conducted in parallel with the\nsearches for RCTs of effectiveness. The second was\na more focused search, delayed until the reviews \nof effectiveness had been completed, aimed at\nsupplementing economic information from the\nRCTs. The former approach was chosen for two\nreasons. Firstly, it was anticipated that RCTs would\nprobably not be the best source of information on\nresource use and that each individual trial would\nnot have incorporated a formal economic evalu-\nation. Secondly, it was predicted that the reviews of\neffectiveness would take most of the time available,\nleaving insufficient time for any later searching of\nthe economics literature. As a result, a separate,\nparallel search strategy of electronic databases was\ndeveloped which attempted to identify the maxi-\nmum number of economic evaluations and studies\nthat considered the resources used in the manage-\nment of ESRD relevant to the six review topics. The\nstrategy was developed by the health economists\nand a research fellow experienced in literature\nsearching. This strategy did not confine itself to\nrandomised or quasi-randomised CCTs, unlike the\nsearch on effectiveness, but included economics\nstudies using other research designs.\nAlthough the detail of each review is slightly\ndifferent, in general, data from the systematic\nreviews of trials were used:\n\u2022 to assess relative effectiveness\n\u2022 to estimate resource use associated with the \ninitial interventions\n\u2022 to estimate the resource consequences, if any, \nof differential rates of adverse events (such \nas complications).\nData from additional material identified in the\nreview of economic studies were used:\n\u2022 to estimate differential rates of adverse events\nwith resource consequences, when such data\nwere not available from the review of RCTs\n\u2022 to provide estimates of the magnitude of\nresources used in each option evaluated, when\nsuch data were not available from the review of\nRCTs (although if more accurate estimates could\nbe obtained from local, that is, UK-based,\ncostings, these were used instead).\nDatabases searched for the review of economic\nstudies were: \n\u2022 Medline\n\u2022 Embase on BIDS\n\u2022 CINAHL\n\u2022 Biosis\n\u2022 IBSS (British Library of Political and Economic\nScience) using BIDS\n\u2022 NEED (NHS Economic Evaluation Database,\nNHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) \non-line\n\u2022 Econlit (American Economics Association) \nusing the search software SilverPlatter\n\u2022 The Economist (The Economist Newspaper Ltd,\nLondon) on CD-ROM.\n4\n4 84 8\n8 8\n4 ?\n?\n?\n? ? ? ?\nA\nB\nC\nD\n1234\nDeclining effectiveness\nI\nn\nc\nr\ne\na\ns\ne\nd\n \nc\no\ns\nt\nFIGURE 3  Matrix linking evidence on effectiveness and cost \n(4 = yes,8 = no;84 = neutral;? = not enough evidence;\n,judgement required to be made.1\n1 In economic terms this judgement about which treatment to\nchoose in areas A3 and C1 involves the same trade-off;is the more\neffective treatment worth its extra cost?However,in practice it may\nbe more difficult to justify the implementation of a lower cost but\nless effective alternative.Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n11\nDetails of the years searched and the search terms\nare presented in appendix 2.\nThe Medline search strategy was the first to be\ndeveloped using similar methodology to that \nfor the electronic search for possible RCTs (see\nchapter 2). The search terms to identify RCTs \nwere omitted in this search strategy. These terms\nwere replaced by terms designed to identify eco-\nnomic evaluations and studies that considered the\nresources used in the management of ESRD. The\nMedline search strategy was then modified for\nsearching other databases (see chapter 2).\nIdentification of potentially relevant\nstudies and economic evaluations from\ntitles,abstracts and keywords\nThe abstracts generated by the search for\nadditional papers relevant to the economic evalu-\nation were assessed by one health economist. This\nfollowed a pilot exercise in which no differences\nwere found in the abstracts selected when they were\nread by two health economists. All possible studies\nthat were potentially relevant to the economics of\nthe management of ESRD were identified using \nthe same standard form (see appendix 10) used in\nthe identification of possible RCTs or quasi-RCTs.\nThese reports were assigned, where appropriate, \nto our six specific topic files and the complete\npublished paper was obtained.\nQuality assessment\nUsing a similar methodology to that described for\nthe systematic review of effectiveness, the method-\nological quality of identified studies was assessed by\none health economist (see the economic quality\nassessment form in appendix 10).\nData abstraction\nA single investigator abstracted data on the\ncharacteristics of participants, interventions \nand outcome measures from each economic\nevaluation, study, RCT or quasi-RCT. The \nprecise data abstracted depended on the topics. \nIn general, information about resource use was\nabstracted on the dialysis treatments described,\ntaking into account their duration and frequency,\nincidence of complications, treatment of compli-\ncations, time delay before complication occurs,\nduration of complication and duration of the\ntreatment of complications.\nWhen data were required on items of resource use\n(i.e. labour, consumables or capital) and on the\noccurrence of events with resource consequences,\nthey were abstracted, if possible from the included\nRCTs. When this was not possible, information was\nabstracted from the less rigorous studies identified\nby the separate economic searches.\nData analysis\nThe objective of the data analysis was to combine\ndata on differential resource use with data on\neffectiveness obtained from the systematic review \nof RCTs of effectiveness. Data were analysed in \ntwo stages. First, when economic evaluations were\nidentified which attempted to address the study\nquestions, their methods were evaluated and their\nresults synthesised. Second, the results of the sys-\ntematic literature search for studies that reported\ndata on resource use were combined with the \ndata on effectiveness obtained from the systematic\nreview of RCTs described above. For all reviews,\nexcept for the comparison of CAPD and haemo-\ndialysis, the information on resource use and cost\nwas combined to assess relative efficiency using \na decision-analysis approach (this is described in\ndetail in appendices 4\u20139). For the comparison of\nCAPD with haemodialysis, the data from formal\neconomic evaluations conducted by others \nwas synthesised. \nAll costs are presented in \u00a3UK for the financial \nyear 1996\/97.Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n13\nSystematic literature review\nOver 12,000 abstracts of published papers \nwere considered for inclusion in the review \nof effectiveness. Table 3 summarises:\n\u2022 where they were first identified\n\u2022 how many were judged to be possible RCTs\nrelevant to ESRD\n\u2022 how many of these were concerned with the\nchosen six topics\n\u2022 how many were confirmed to be RCTs suitable\nfor inclusion\n\u2022 how many were considered in the \neconomic analysis.\nFull details are presented in appendix 3.\nResults of searches for RCTs for\nassessing effectiveness\nThe search identified 537 studies as possible \nRCTs relevant to the topics under review, of which\nfour were conducted in the UK. However, after\nassessment of the full published papers of these\nstudies, only 47 were found to be RCTs in which\nany of our predetermined outcome measures for\none or more of the reviews had been considered.\nOf these, 34 were found on Medline after reading\n5429 abstracts, a further five were found among the\n6447 abstracts generated by the systematic searches\nof the other electronic databases, and the\nremaining eight were found by other means.\nResults of economic searches\nIn the supplementary health economics electronic\nsearches, a total of 4168 abstracts, additional to\nthose from the effectiveness search were assessed.\nFor 820 of these, full papers were ordered as they\nappeared likely to contain information. Most \nof these papers were used either to clarify the \nissues around the six questions or for reference\nChapter 4\nSummary of results\nTABLE 3  Sources of RCTs included in the reviews\nSource Number  Number of possible  Number of possible  Number of \nof reports  RCTs relevant  RCTs relevant  RCTs included in \nidentified\na to ESRD\nb to topics\nb,c final review\nMedline 5429 1480 243 34\nEmbase 4764 391 81 4\nCINAHL 366 25 10 0\nBiosis 1317 189 4 1\nCochrane Library N\/A\nd N\/A\nd 20\nSubtotal (systematic \nelectronic searches) 11,876 2085 340 39\nOther databases\ne 269 122 9 0\nHandsearching 287 133 48 0\nReference lists and experts in the field 56\nf N\/A\ng 140 8\nh\nSubtotal (all other sources) 612 255 197 8\nTOTAL 12,488 2340 537 47\na Some reports were identified from more than one source\nb Includes controlled trials with quasi-random methods of allocation\nc Relevant to the six selected topics\nd A nephrologist searched this database on-screen and selected RCTs\/CCTs relevant only to the six topics (for search strategy \nsee appendix 2)\ne Chemabs,SIGLE,CRIB,and NRR\nf Numbers of reference lists checked\ng Collected possible RCTs for the six topics only\nh Responses from the authors of RCTs and CCTs are currently being assessed;any additional RCTs will be incorporated into later \nversions of the Cochrane systematic reviews.Five RCTs came from reference lists and three from experts in the fieldSummary of results\n14\nwhen developing the methodology to address \neach question.\nDiscussion\nAlthough the aim was a highly sensitive but\nrelatively non-specific search strategy, we were \nstill surprised by the number of reports identi-\nfied. In respect of RCTs alone, approximately\n12,000 abstracts were assessed and this repre-\nsented a major undertaking with significant\nresource implications for the project group. From\nour prior knowledge of the field, we did not expect\nto find many RCTs. Although the dividend of only\nthree RCTs per 1000 abstracts assessed seems\ndisappointing, the total number of relevant RCTs\nidentified (47) is somewhat greater than was\nexpected. However, as described later, the RCTs\ntended to be small and of variable quality.\nAbout 70% of relevant RCTs were identified from\nthe Medline search, which is consistent with experi-\nence in other fields. It confirms that the decision to\nsearch Medline first was correct. The next greatest\nyield was from Embase but only about one extra\nRCT was found for each 1000 abstracts checked.\nThe decision to carry out a broad search for\neconomic studies at the beginning of the review\nperiod also resulted in the assessment of large\nnumbers of additional papers. However, the time\ntaken to complete the reviews of effectiveness was\nlonger than expected, and allowed no time later \nfor the more focused economics searches that \nhad been initially considered.\nIn the light of our experience, one option in future\neconomic evaluations would be to perform a restrict-\ned literature search at the beginning of the review\nperiod, and supplement this by further focused\nsearches to address any outstanding gaps once the\neffectiveness reviews have been completed.\nReview 1:Comparison of \nsynthetic with cellulose and\nmodified cellulose membranes \nin the haemodialysis of patients\nwith ESRD\nThe full systematic review is presented in \nappendix 4.\nBackground\nThe basic principle of haemodialysis is that\nproducts of protein breakdown and water can \nbe removed when blood is passed over a semi-\npermeable membrane in a dialyser with dialysate\nflowing on the other side. Metabolites are removed\nmainly by diffusion and water by the application \nof a pressure gradient across the membrane.\nCellulose-based membranes, produced principally\nfrom cotton, were the first membranes produced\nfor dialysis and, in their standard form, have a low\nhydraulic permeability (low flux). Characteristic-\nally, they also have poor clearance of molecules\nlarger in size than urea and creatinine, and this\nmay be responsible for some of the clinical features\nof uraemia. Because of their poor clearance of b2\nmicroglobulin, it is thought that amyloid disease\nmay occur more frequently in patients treated with\nthese membranes. This condition is characterised\nby carpal tunnel syndrome, bone and joint disease;\nit rarely occurs during the first 5 years of dialysis\nbut by 12 years it affects 50% of patients.\nIn recent years standard cellulose membranes have\nbeen modified to make both larger molecule and\nwater removal more efficient; that is, they can be\nmanufactured to have a higher flux than was possi-\nble with standard cellulose membranes; such mem-\nbranes are called modified cellulose, substituted\ncellulose or semi-synthetic membranes. In general,\nthey are more expensive than standard membranes\nalthough this may now be changing.\nIn the early 1970s, synthetic polymer-based mem-\nbranes became available. They are usually manu-\nfactured with high-flux characteristics but can also\nbe manufactured to have a low flux. They may\nremove b2 microglobulin, which may cause dialysis-\nrelated amyloid disease, more effectively, especially\nthose which have high-flux characteristics. It is of\nparticular importance to evaluate the benefits of the\nsynthetic membranes. Although high-flux properties\nmay be better, they are generally about three to four\ntimes as expensive as cellulose or modified cellulose\nmembranes. Despite the economic and practical\nimportance of the choice of dialysis membrane, the\nbenefits of synthetic membranes are not clear to\nnephrologists or to healthcare planners and, if\nbenefits do exist, can their extra costs be justified.\nObjective\nThe objectives of the study were:\n\u2022 to determine whether good evidence supports \nthe view that synthetic membranes offer clinically\nimportant advantages compared with standard\ncellulose or modified cellulose membranes in the\nhaemodialysis of patients with ESRD\n\u2022 to determine from the literature the resource-\nuse implications and relative efficiency analysis\nof the use of synthetic membranes.Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n15\nThe hypotheses being tested were that using\nsynthetic membranes (compared with cellulose \nor modified cellulose membranes):\n(i) reduces the frequency of adverse symptoms\nduring dialysis (symptomatic hypotension,\nheadaches, nausea and vomiting, pruritus \nand anaphylaxis)\n(ii) reduces the number of significant infections\nand hospital admissions (including length \nof stay)\n(iii) improves dialysis adequacy, as measured by\nKt\/V or urea reduction ratio (URR)\n(iv) decreases predialysis b2 microglobulin values\nand the incidence of amyloidosis\n(v) improves the patient\u2019s lipid profile\n(vi) improves predialysis albumin and protein\ncatabolic rate (PCR)\n(vii)improves quality of life and patient survival.\nMethods\nSearch strategy, inclusion criteria and methods of\nthe review are described in chapters 2 and 3 and\nappendices 2 and 4.\nResults\nThe inclusion criteria were met by 22 studies; \ndata from these were summated by meta-analyses \u2013\nPeto\u2019s OR and WMD \u2013 and 22 outcome measures\nwere sought. For two outcome measures, number\nof episodes of significant infection per year and\nquality of life, no data were available and for one,\nURR \u2013 a measure of dialysis adequacy \u2013 data were\nnot given in a form that could be analysed. For the\ncomparison of cellulose with synthetic membranes,\ndata for 10\/19 outcome measures were studied \nin only a single trial. For modified cellulose and\nsynthetic membranes, 4\/7 outcome measures were\neach assessed in one trial only and for 12 of the\noutcomes no trials were found.\nThe incidence of nausea and vomiting was signifi-\ncantly less with synthetic than with cellulose mem-\nbranes (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49, 0.78). Predialysis\nb2 microglobulin concentrations were significantly\nlower at the end of the studies in patients treated\nwith synthetic membranes, although all studies\nwhich showed this effect used high-flux synthetic\nmembranes (WMD, 14.5; 95% CI, 17.4, \u201311.6).\nSimilarly, one study showed that the incidence \nof amyloid was less in patients who were dialysed\nfor a period of 6 years with high-flux synthetic\nmembranes; no low-flux membranes were used in\nthis study (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.18). Plasma\ntriglyceride values were lower with synthetic\nmembranes (high-flux) in the single study that\nmeasured this outcome (WMD, \u20130.660; 95% CI,\n\u20131.181, \u20130.139). Serum albumin was also higher \nin patients treated with synthetic membranes\n(WMD, \u20130.111; 95% CI, \u20130.210, \u20130.013).\nIt is therefore difficult to determine whether the\ndifferences found were attributable to the materials\nfrom which the membranes were made or to the\ndifferences in flux. There was no significant differ-\nence between these membranes for any of the\nother clinical outcomes measures.\nPruritus occurred less frequently with synthetic\nmembranes than modified cellulose membranes\n(OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66, 0.93); no other differences\nwere found. The differences between synthetic \nand modified cellulose appeared smaller, although\nmany fewer trials were carried out for this com-\nparison. Economic evaluation showed that these\nadditional benefits for synthetic membranes \nwere achieved at considerable cost.\nConclusions and implications\nPolicy implications\nThe authors are hesitant to recommend the\nuniversal use of synthetic membranes for haemo-\ndialysis in patients with ESRD on the basis of the\nabove results because of the small number of trials\n(many with low patient numbers), the hetero-\ngeneity of many of the trials compared, the vari-\nations in membrane flux and the differences in\nexclusion criteria, particularly co-morbidity. There\nis insufficient information from this review to carry\nout a satisfactory economic evaluation. Such evi-\ndence as there is favours synthetic membranes over\ncellulose membranes but if extra benefit is assumed\nit would be at considerable cost, particularly if \nhigh-flux membranes were to be used. In particular,\nlittle evidence was found of any difference between\nsynthetic and modified cellulose membranes.\nHowever, the price of high-flux membranes is \nlikely to change in the future; hence, policy\nrecommendations should be kept under review.\nFuture research needs\nFurther RCTs are required to compare the\ndifferent dialysis membranes available.\nThey are required to:\n(i) take into account reuse of membranes and\nother properties, particularly flux, as well \nas the material from which the membrane \nis made, and should include modified cellu-\nlose membranes and low-flux synthetic mem-\nbranes which are less expensive than their\nhigh-flux counterpartsSummary of results\n16\n(ii) record the minimum of data concentrating \non primary outcomes of major importance \nto patients\n(iii) explicitly record whether the symptoms used \nas outcome measures are patient or staff\nreported, while recognising that, in general,\npatient-reported data will be more appropriate\nfor evaluating effectiveness but staff-reported\ndata may be necessary for calculating the cost\nof treating complications\n(iv) be multicentre (and possibly multinational) \nin order to have sufficient patients to com-\nplete the study and allow for withdrawals \nand drop-outs\n(v) have sufficient length of follow-up to draw\nconclusions about important clinical outcome\nmeasures and continue to follow-up patients\nwho have undergone transplantation\n(vi) include older patients and those with \nco-morbid illnesses, and take age and \nco-morbidity into account when assessing\noutcomes (possibly by stratification at \ntrial entry)\n(vii)carry out an economic evaluation.\nReview 2:Comparison of\nbicarbonate-buffered with\nacetate-buffered dialysate in\nhaemodialysis as treatment \nfor patients with ESRD\nThe full systematic review is presented in \nappendix 5.\nBackground\nBicarbonate has largely replaced acetate dialysate\nin the haemodialysis of patients with ESRD in the\nUK, on the assumption that it significantly reduces\nintradialytic adverse symptoms and improves\nhaemodynamic stability.\nObjective\nThe objective of this review was to compare\nbicarbonate with acetate haemodialysis in patients\nwith ESRD and to assess whether there is evidence\nof improved patient outcome to support its\nadoption as the dialysate of choice. The cost\nimplications of using bicarbonate haemodialysis\ninstead of acetate haemodialysis were also to be\nexamined. The hypotheses being tested were \nthat bicarbonate haemodialysis:\n(i) reduces the frequency of adverse \nsymptoms during dialysis compared \nwith acetate haemodialysis\n(ii) improves cardiovascular stability during dialysis\ncompared with acetate haemodialysis\n(iii) improves the patient\u2019s lipid profile compared\nwith acetate haemodialysis\n(iv) slows the progression of renal bone disease\ncompared with acetate haemodialysis.\nMethods\nSearch strategy, inclusion criteria and methods \nof the review are described in chapter 2 and in\nappendices 2 and 5.\nResults\nThe inclusion criteria were met by 18 studies and\ndata from these studies were synthesised using\nmeta-analyses. There was a significant reduction\nwith bicarbonate dialysis in the number of haemo-\ndialysis treatments complicated by headaches (OR,\n0.84; 95% CI, 0.71, 0.99), nausea\/vomiting (OR,\n0.42; 95% CI, 0.26, 0.66), symptomatic hypotension\n(OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11, 0.69) and non-specific\nintolerance (OR, 0.79; 95% CI; 0.67, 0.93). There\nwas a lack of clear evidence of benefit from\nbicarbonate dialysis in terms of improved cardio-\nvascular stability, lipid profile and indicators of \nrenal bone disease.\nConclusions and implications\nPolicy implications\n1. Bicarbonate dialysis is preferable to acetate\ndialysis for the haemodialysis of patients with\nESRD because of its associated reduction in\nintradialytic adverse symptoms and similar cost.\n2. In those countries with less well-financed \nrenal replacement services, who continue to\ndepend on haemodialysis machines that can\nonly use acetate dialysate, replacement of \ntheir machines with those that can use either\ndialysate should be encouraged as replace-\nments are required. However, the cost to \ntheir healthcare systems of a complete rapid\nchange to new dialysis machines or modifi-\ncation of all their present machines would \nnot be warranted on the basis of the relatively\nmodest benefits which bicarbonate dialysis\noffers. The benefits of such changes need to \nbe considered in terms of their opportunity\ncost and this will vary from country to country.\nThe provision of information on the costs and\nbenefits of such a change provided in this\nreview should assist in the estimation of such\nopportunity costs.\nFuture research needs\nMethodologically sound clinical trials with long-\nterm follow-up comparing bicarbonate with acetate\nhaemodialysis are rare. We should continue to Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n17\nbe open-minded about the possible beneficial \nor adverse effects that bicarbonate dialysis may \nhave on long-term outcomes such as lipid profile \nand cardiovascular disease, renal bone disease \nand morbidity.\nAny further RCT at this stage is unlikely to produce\nsignificantly different data from that which exists\nalready and is therefore unlikely to change \nclinical practice.\nReview 3:Comparison of \nshort duration with standard\nduration haemodialysis as\ntreatment for patients \nwith ESRD\nThe full systematic review is presented in \nappendix 6.\nBackground\nShortening haemodialysis treatment time is\nwelcomed by the patient and is seen by the health-\ncare purchaser as an improved use of resources.\nTechnological advances, coupled with patient pres-\nsure and pressure on costs, led to the development\nand implementation of shortened dialysis schedules,\nparticularly in the USA. However, the annual mor-\ntality among dialysis patients in the USA began to\nincrease as the average dialysis treatment times\ndecreased. If short dialysis is at least comparable \nto standard dialysis in terms of clinical outcome, \nit should be offered to all appropriate patients. If,\nhowever, it has significant disadvantages compared\nto standard dialysis, either in the short or long term,\nthose patients to whom it is being offered should \nbe made aware of the potential trade-off.\nObjective\nThe objective of this review is to ascertain the \neffect of short haemodialysis treatment duration \n(> 3.5 hours) on patient morbidity and mortality,\nassuming a treatment frequency of three per week.\nIt also attempts to assess patient preference and \nthe impact of shortened treatments on healthcare\nresource use.\nMethods\nSearch strategy, inclusion criteria and methods of\nthe review are described in chapters 2 and 3 and \nin appendices 2 and 6.\nResults\nOnly a single study by Lowrie and colleagues\n(1983) with 165 randomised patients was identified.\nThere was no significant difference in mortality\n(OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.05, 5.15). Morbidity as\nreflected by hospitalisation rates was greater in \nthe short-duration dialysis group (OR, 2.85; 95%\nCI, 1.39, 5.85). There was no conclusive differ-\nence in the incidence of intradialytic adverse\nsymptoms between the groups. Blood pressure\ncontrol was worse in the short-duration dialysis\ngroup as indicated by predialysis systolic blood\npressure (mean difference, 7.5 mmHg; 95% CI, \n3.1, 11.8), predialysis diastolic pressure (mean\ndifference, 2.9 mmHg; 95% CI, 0.5, 5.2), and\npredialysis mean arterial blood pressure (mean\ndifference, 3.4 mmHg; 95% CI, 0.0, 6.9).\nConclusions and implications\nPolicy implications\n1. Current evidence from this North American\nstudy offers little reassurance that short-\nduration dialysis (\u2264 3.5 hours, three times per\nweek) is as effective as standard dialysis. There\nis no evidence that reduced dialysis duration\nimproves patient outcome in terms of mor-\ntality and morbidity. It may, in fact, increase\nmorbidity as reflected by increased hospital-\nisation and poorer blood pressure control.\nFrom this it is concluded that \u2018standard\u2019\ndialysis duration (> 3.5 hours, three times \nper week) should remain the recommended\ntreatment. It should be noted that no study \nwas found that compared the longer duration\ndialysis that is the norm in Europe.\n2. If a reduced dialysis duration regimen is\nimplemented on the basis of patient prefer-\nence or assumed lower cost, its unproven safety\nshould be explicitly acknowledged.\nFuture research needs\n1. One or more large, multicentre, pragmatic\nRCTs comparing haemodialysis treatment\nduration policies are required. Such a trial\nshould include the longer duration haemo-\ndialysis practised in Europe, have minimum\nexclusion criteria, a long follow-up period and\nminimum data collection that concentrates\nprimarily on patient morbidity and mortality.\nThe follow-up should include patients who\nwithdraw (for example, for renal transplant-\nation) and all patients should be followed for a\nperiod after trial completion to assess residual\neffect on mortality and morbidity. Key primary\noutcomes such as mortality should be analysed\non an intention-to-treat basis. Avoidance of\ncollection of secondary outcome data should\nreduce the complexity of such a trial. Dialysis\ntherapy and the overall treatment of ESRD\nwithin such a trial should be to the highestSummary of results\n18\nstandard as recommended by the best \navailable evidence.\n2. If such a trial showed no advantage with stand-\nard duration dialysis, short-duration dialysis\nshould be the recommended treatment option.\n3. The HEMO RCT, comparing high- and low-\nflux membranes and the ability to achieve a\ngiven Kt\/V, is at present under way. It may\naddress some of the above questions. This\nshould be taken into account when the\nresearch agenda is decided.\nReview 4:Comparison of CAPD\ndelivery systems \u2013 Y-set\/modified\nY-set versus standard spike as\ntreatment for patients with ESRD\nThe full systematic review is presented in \nappendix 7.\nBackground\nCAPD is an alternative to haemodialysis for patients\nwith ESRD. It may be used as the first choice ther-\napy and, in a number of countries, more patients\nare treated by this modality of treatment than by\nhaemodialysis. Catheter and transfer set types,\ninsertion techniques, and peri- and post-operative\nmanagement display significant variation.\nThere are two main types of catheter \nconnecting systems:\n(i) the standard or straight connecting system in\nwhich the catheter is connected with a straight\npiece of tubing, which in turn is connected to\nthe dialysate bag. At each exchange the bag is\ndrained and a new connection is made. The\nempty bag is rolled up and remains attached\nuntil the next exchange when the process \nis repeated\n(ii) the Y-set in which the patient is disconnected\nfrom bags between exchanges and, when a new\nexchange is due, a Y-connection is used, with\none limb connected to an empty bag and one\nto a bag containing fresh dialysate. The peri-\ntoneal dialysate is first drained into the empty\nbag. Before introducing the new fluid, the Y-\nconnector is flushed with fresh dialysate into\nthe drained bag, which allows any bacteria to\nbe flushed into the spent fluid. The fresh fluid\nis then introduced into the peritoneal cavity\nand the connector removed from the catheter.\nAt present about 40% of CAPD patients in the \nUK use this connecting system (data from the\nNational Registry provided at the Renal \nAssociation meeting, 1997).\nObjective\nThe aim of this review is to describe the best\npractice for CAPD-connecting systems, insofar \nas present evidence allows, and to indicate where\nfuture research should be concentrated.\nThe hypothesis being tested was that the \nY-connector\/modified Y-connector was asso-\nciated with fewer episodes of peritonitis than \nthe standard connector in patients on CAPD.\nMethods\nSearch strategy, inclusion criteria and methods of\nthe review are described in chapters 2 and 3 and in\nappendices 2 and 7.\nResults\nSix studies met the inclusion criteria and results of\nthese studies were synthesised using meta-analysis.\nThe Y-set\/modified Y-set significantly reduced the\nincidence of CAPD-related peritonitis compared\nwith standard non-Y-set connection systems. There\nwas no difference in the incidence of exit-site\ninfections between the two methods.\nThe number of patients who experienced at \nleast one episode of peritonitis in all the studies\ncombined was significantly lower in patients using\nthe Y-set delivery systems (57\/194 versus 107\/201;\nOR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23, 0.53) compared with those\nassigned the non-Y-set system. Only one study\n(Cheng, et al., 1994 \u2013 see appendix 7) did not show\nthis effect, although all studies demonstrated a\nsignificant increase in the number of months per\nepisode of peritonitis. No study provided standard\ndeviations for this statistic and, hence, a WMD\ncould not be obtained. All studies also showed \nthat the time to first peritonitis was longer with \nthe use of Y-set\/modified Y-set systems.\nThere was no evidence of significant reduction in\nthe number of patients who suffered exit site infec-\ntion or tunnel infections with the Y-set (39\/162\nversus 44\/171; OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.51, 1.48).\nConclusions and implications\nPolicy implications\nPeritonitis is one of the main complications of \nCAPD and is known to lead to morbidity, technique\nfailure and mortality. Based on the results of this\nreview, there is insufficient evidence to support the\ncontinued use of non-Y-set connecting systems in\nCAPD. The economic evaluation of this reviewHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n19\nreveals that the use of a Y- or modified Y-set\nconnector imposes an incremental cost of approxi-\nmately \u00a3900 to \u00a33900 per patient per year, based on\nlow and high cost estimates. Preventing one episode\nof peritonitis would cost approximately \u00a34700 per\ncase of peritonitis avoided. However, there was wide\nvariation in this estimate, which depended on the\nrelative probability of peritonitis episodes.\nThe Y-set delivery system significantly reduces \nthe incidence of peritonitis. Given that recurrent\nperitonitis is a major course of technique failure,\nthe additional cost is likely to be justified.\nFuture research needs\nPeritonitis remains a major problem in CAPD and\nfurther research into methods of prevention of this\ncomplication is required.\nEvidence of the effect of technique failure on\npatient outcomes and costs would further inform\nthe evidence concerning the use of Y-set systems.\nReview 5:Comparison of CCPD\nwith CAPD as treatment for\npatients with ESRD\nThe full systematic review is presented in \nappendix 8.\nBackground\nCAPD is an alternative to haemodialysis for patients\nwith ESRD. Dialysate fluid is drained into and then\nout of (exchange) the peritoneal space using a\nsurgically-placed permanent catheter in the abdom-\ninal wall. These exchanges are performed four times\ndaily. One of the major complications of the tech-\nnique is peritonitis. CCPD is a modification of this\ntechnique in which exchanges are performed over-\nnight by a machine and it has recently been pro-\nposed as an alternative for all patients suitable for\nchronic peritoneal dialysis. It has also been suggest-\ned that it may decrease the incidence of peritonitis.\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this study were to undertake a\nsystematic literature review comparing CCPD with\nCAPD, while testing the following hypotheses with\nwhich CCPD is associated:\n(i) reduced incidence of dialysis-associated\ninfections\n(ii) improved adequacy of dialysis\n(iii) reduced incidence of technique failure\n(iv) increased patient preference for the technique\n(compared with CAPD).\nMethods\nSearch strategy, inclusion criteria and methods of\nthe review are described in chapters 2 and 3 and \nin appendices 2 and 8.\nResults\nOnly a single study involving 82 patients met \nthe inclusion criteria. Results are expressed \nas ORs and WMDs. There were no significant\ndifferences in the number of patients with\nperitonitis (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.24, 1.33), \ncatheter exit-site infections (OR, 1.13; 95% CI,\n0.43, 2.94) or catheter-tunnel infections (OR,\n0.5; 95% CI, 0.05, 4.99). However, when infective\ncomplications were reported as episodes per\npatient year, the study demonstrated a reduced\nmean incidence per patient year of peritonitis \u2013\nCCPD, 0.51; CAPD, 0.94 (p = 0.03). There was \nno significant difference in measures of dialysis\nadequacy, such as Kt\/V (WMD, 0.40; 95% CI, \n\u20130.23, 1.03) and 6-monthly serum creatinine, \nurea and phosphate. Though fewer patients \non CCPD needed to change dialysis technique \nthis was not statistically significant (OR, 0.48; \n95% CI, 0.18, 1.26).\nBecause this was a parallel group trial design,\npatient preference could not be adequately\nassessed. We estimated that the cost per \nepisode of peritonitis avoided by using CCPD \nwas \u00a321,000.\nConclusions and implications\nPolicy implications\nThe review indicated that CCPD showed benefit \nfor one patient outcome but is more expensive\nthan CAPD. The authors suggest that, at present,\nCCPD is offered to patients for whom there is a\nspecific indication. However, patient preference \nis likely to be important here.\nFuture research needs\n1. Further RCTs are required which compare\nCCPD with CAPD with particular reference \nto peritonitis, technique failure rates and\npatient preference. If these confirm \nthe reduced peritonitis rate of CCPD, \nthen it may need to be considered as \nthe preferred chronic peritoneal \ndialysis option.\n2. More widespread use of CCPD may have\nsignificant resource-use implications. \nFuture RCTs should include a thorough\neconomic evaluation to provide more\ninformation on whether any additional\nbenefits are worth the additional resources\nthat CCPD, relative to CAPD, may require.Summary of results\n20\nRCTs and economic evaluations are required to\ncompare CCPD with haemodialysis to determine\nwhether it is efficient to provide CCPD for those\npatients who have a relative contraindication \nto CAPD and would otherwise be treated \nby haemodialysis.\nReview 6:Comparison of\nhaemodialysis with CAPD \nas treatment for patients \nwith ESRD\nA full systematic review is presented in appendix 9.\nBackground\nPatients with ESRD require either dialysis \n(haemo- or peritoneal dialysis) or renal transplant-\nation to maintain life. Transplantation is normally\nconsidered to be the preferred choice but there \nare insufficient donors to meet the demand. There-\nfore, for those patients for whom transplants are\nunavailable or who are unsuitable for transplant-\nation, there is the question of which mode of\ndialysis should be used.\nObjective\nThe objective was to ascertain if there is clear\nevidence for the increased effectiveness of haemo-\ndialysis compared with CAPD for all patients with\nESRD, or a particular subgroup of patients with\nESRD. It was also the aim to ascertain the relative\ncosts of haemodialysis and CAPD and to combine\nthis information with the information on effective-\nness to determine which of these modalities is the \nmore efficient.\nMethods\nThe methodology used to answer this question is\ndescribed in detail in chapter 3. In addition, the\nsystematic review of \u2018economic aspects\u2019 identified\nformal economic evaluations that had tried to\nassess the relative efficiency of CAPD and haemo-\ndialysis. The results of these economic evaluations\nwere summarised to provide an overall view of the\ncurrent evidence of the relative efficiency of these\ntwo modes of treatment.\nResults\nNo RCTs were identified that compared CAPD \nwith haemodialysis. The economic evaluations\nidentified made assumptions on the basis of data\nfrom poor quality study designs that CAPD is\ncheaper than haemodialysis and, in some cases,\nthat haemodialysis provides better patient survival.\nBecause of the poor quality of the study designs\nused to obtain primary data, it is not possible to\njudge whether the assumed extra benefits provided\nby haemodialysis are worth any extra costs that \nmay be incurred.\nConclusions and implications\nThe issue facing the health service is not whether\nto have CAPD or haemodialysis but rather the\nbalance of provision between the two modalities.\nWe know from variations in uptake of these tech-\nniques in different countries that a large propor-\ntion of patients requiring dialysis for ESRD could\nbe managed with either CAPD or haemodialysis\ninitially. What is required is information about the\nrelative costs, benefits and risks of policies of start-\ning with one or other modality. In this respect, it\nshould be possible to develop a more detailed\nmodel based upon observational data. Ideally,\ninformation on benefits and risks should come\nfrom comparisons, within a pragmatic RCT, of\npolicies based on starting with CAPD or\nhaemodialysis, as used in the UK.\nData are not available to allow reliable conclusions\nto be drawn about the relative effectiveness and\nefficiency of haemodialysis and CAPD.\nIf an assumption is made of equal effectiveness in\nterms of survival then the limited data available\nfavour CAPD.\nAlthough some studies have assumed that a policy\nof starting with haemodialysis is more effective \nthan a policy of starting with CAPD, it is not\npossible to quantify reliably with current data \nthis extra benefit and, hence, it is not possible \nto determine whether haemodialysis is worth any\nextra cost that may be incurred. This issue would \nbe resolved most reliably by a pragmatic RCT \nthat includes a formal economic evaluation com-\nparing the two policies. Currently, Baxter Ltd \nare attempting to undertake a RCT in this area\n(Personal communication, 1997).\nThe implications of policies based on starting \nwith haemodialysis rather than on CAPD are more\ncomplex than described in previously reported\neconomic evaluations. An attempt at a more sophis-\nticated economic model is described in appendix 9.\nThe results obtained using this model are, however,\ninconclusive, because of the poor quality of \nthe data.\nThe development of new methods of dialysis, such\nas CCPD, and the advances in renal transplantation\ntechniques warrant additional evaluation to investi-\ngate their place alongside haemodialysis and CAPD\nin the treatment of ESRD.Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n21\nT\nhe management of ESRD was one of the first\npriorities identified in the NHS R&D Health\nTechnology Assessment Programme. The original\n1994 commissioning brief, which led to the work\nreported here, called for a systematic review of\nESRD, \u201cconcentrating on the effectiveness and \ncost-effectiveness of alternative schedules of con-\nventional haemodialysis and CAPD\u201d. Given the\ncomplexity of the issues involved, and the limited\ntime and resources available, we chose to concen-\ntrate on what were judged to be key \u2018decision\npoints\u2019 in the management of ESRD. The choice\nwas made after developing a dialysis decision tree\n(see Figure 1) and six topics were selected. There\nare, therefore, many aspects of the management \nof ESRD which are not addressed directly in this\nstudy (although an attempt was made to consider\nsome of these, such as co-morbidity, indirectly).\nThis is not then a comprehensive systematic \nreview of the management of ESRD.\nThe reviews were performed systematically in the\nsense that there were explicit search strategies,\nexplicit selection criteria for the studies considered,\nexplicit data extraction protocols and explicit\nmethods for data synthesis. In other words, it would\nbe expected that repetition of this study would be\nlikely to lead to similar findings. The reviews were\nnot, however, comprehensive in the sense that all\ntypes of evidence were considered. It was judged that\nprotection from the distorting effects of selection\nand other biases was likely to be most secure if our\nreviews were limited to RCTs and so other study\ndesigns were not considered systematically (other\nthan in the review of economic analysis of haemo-\ndialysis compared with CAPD). When this decision\nwas taken, we were aware of the argument that some\nwell-conducted non-randomised cohort studies may\nbe less prone to bias that poor quality RCTs. Never-\ntheless, it was decided that it was important to iden-\ntify and assess all RCTs first; also, we realised that we\ndid not have the resources to identify studies using\nother research designs systematically, partly because\nof the work involved in finding the RCTs and partly\nbecause the methods for finding well-conducted\nobservational studies are not well developed.\nIn an attempt to avoid duplication of effort, a\nbroad search for RCTs related to the management\nof ESRD in general was undertaken rather than\nsearches restricted to just the six topic areas form-\nally covered. We were fortunate to be able to draw\non the search strategy developed for this purpose\nby the Cochrane Collaboration, although this did\nneed extensive adaptation for use on databases\nother that Medline. The aim was for a sensitive\nsearch to identify as complete a register of relevant\ntrials as possible. In retrospect, the size of this task\nwas underestimated, particularly in respect of the\nrelatively poor specificity that this decision implied.\nIn the event, about 12,500 abstracts were assessed\n(see Table 3) in order to identify the 47 RCTs\nconsidered in the six reviews.\nDespite these efforts, it is possible that a few\nrelevant RCTs have not been included: non-English\nlanguage databases were not searched; \u2018grey\nliterature\u2019 has been covered to only a limited\nextent; Science Citation Index has not been fully\nused; the Internet has not been fully explored, and\nhand-searching has been limited. It is difficult to\nestimate how many relevant RCTs may have been\npublished in non-English language journals or are\nnon-European based RCTs missed in the searches;\nno language limits were used when searching the\nelectronic databases and, where possible, non-\nEnglish papers were translated to clarify, first, if\nthey were RCTs and, second, if they were relevant\nto the six topics (so far only nine possible RCTs\nidentified from the searches have not been trans-\nlated; 22 papers were translated). It has not been\npossible to estimate the size of the renal literature\nin, for example, Japan (where the Cochrane \nStroke Group found 25% of its RCTs); a search \nof Medline (1993\u2013November 1997) found almost\n3000 possible RCTs related to ESRD and dialysis, \nof which 47 were in Japanese and a further 149, \nin languages other than Japanese, were by authors\nbased in Japan. Contact with the authors of the \none Japanese study included in the reviews and\nwith other authors based outside Europe did not\nidentify any new relevant RCTs in any language.\nAlso, responses are still being received from\nauthors of abstracts and articles clarifying their\nstudy methodologies and suggesting other possible\nRCTs; hence, it has not been possible to consider\nthese here. It was partly for this reason that the\nreviews were written using the Cochrane format.\nThis will allow them to be updated easily as and\nwhen further RCTs are identified.\nChapter 5\nDiscussionDiscussion\n22\nWe were fortunate to be given access to all the\nresources of the Cochrane Collaboration at a time\nwhen there was no formal Cochrane Renal Group.\n(This was subsequently established in 1997 with one\nof us, Alison MacLeod, as an editor.) The use of the\ncustomised software, Review Manager, made the\ntask much easier, with the one limitation that some\nforms of data, such as medians, cannot yet be\ncombined statistically using its meta-analysis\nprogram, Meta-view.\nIn contrast to some areas of clinical practice, such\nas cancer, heart disease, and prenatal medicine, the\nmanagement of ESRD has not been characterised\nby large collaborative RCTs. The 47 relevant RCTs\nfound were, therefore, as large a number as we had\noriginally hoped for. Nevertheless, their value is\nlimited. One reason is that they did not cover the\nsix topics uniformly (see appendix 3, Table 5).\nWhereas 22 studies compared alternative haemo-\ndialysis membranes, none addressed what is argu-\nably the most important question, the comparison\nof haemodialysis with CAPD (topic 6). Another\nreason for their limited value is that the 47 trials\nwere of variable but generally poor quality. Many\nwere poorly reported making it difficult to judge\nthe methods used. Details of attempts to avoid \nbias, such as methods of randomisation or analyses,\nwere often not available. When it was possible to\njudge, the methods were often sub-optimal. Drop-\nouts were common following changes in clinical\nmanagement and yet intention-to-treat analyses\nwere the exception rather than the rule. Also, \nthe issue of appropriate censoring of data after\ntransplantation was often not considered.\nMost trials included small numbers of participants,\nso that estimates of effects were often imprecise,\nparticularly for dichotomous variables. Even after\ncombining data, where possible, from more than\none trial, the CIs for these estimates were often so\nwide that it was frequently not possible to rule out \na clinically important difference, even when the\npoint estimate suggested that there was none. (To\nput this another way, lack of statistical significance\ncould not be taken as \u2018no clinically significant\ndifference\u2019 in many comparisons.)\nAnother concern when reviewing small trials \nsuch as those included in these reviews is the pos-\nsibility that selective publication of the results of\nsmall trials which showed \u2018statistically significant\ndifferences\u2019, combined with the failure to report\nless promising results of other small trials, may \nlead to important publication bias. Contact with \nthe authors of the included RCTs and with manu-\nfacturers did not uncover unpublished RCTs. This\nmay mean that these data do not exist or that con-\ntacts were unwilling to release details or were not\naware of the importance of unpublished results to\nthe systematic review process. For the majority of\noutcomes, there were too few trials to explore the\nimpact of publication bias formally, for example,\nusing a funnel plot. For a small number of out-\ncomes, however, the construction of a funnel plot\nwas possible. For example, within the comparison \nof bicarbonate with acetate dialysate, funnel \nplots could be constructed for the outcomes of\npatients experiencing headaches and nausea\/\nvomiting. These are presented in Figures 4 and 5. \nA publication bias effect is suggested because \n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nSize\nOR\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\nFIGURE 4  Funnel plot for bicarbonate versus acetate dialysate \u2013 patients experiencing headachesHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n23\nthere are no small trials reporting in favour of the\ncontrol treatment. The interpretation of the results\nof small trials for the comparison of bicarbonate\nversus acetate dialysate should, therefore, be treated\nwith caution. A similar effect is seen in the funnel\nplot for peritonitis episodes for the comparison \nof Y-set versus standard spike delivery systems in\nCAPD (Figure 6). For the comparison of synthetic\nversus cellulose membranes for symptomatic\/\ntreatment requiring hypotension, however, \nthere was no evidence to suggest publication \nbias, with comparable representation of both\npositive and negative results among the small trials\n(Figure 7).\nA related concern is selective reporting within \nthe 47 RCTs of outcome data that are statistically\nsignificant. It is not reassuring in this respect that\ndata are available from only a minority of relevant\ntrials for many comparisons in the reviews.\nThe generalisability of the trials is also limited.\nTheir eligibility criteria were usually restrictive\n(aiming to study a tightly defined group of patients)\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nSize\nOR\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\nFIGURE 5  Funnel plot for bicarbonate versus acetate dialysate \u2013 patients experiencing nausea\/vomiting\n150\n100\n50\n0\nSize\nOR\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\nFIGURE 6  Funnel plot for Y-set versus standard spike delivery system \u2013 patients experiencing peritonitisDiscussion\n24\nand they were mostly conducted at single centres.\nThey also tended to concentrate on short-term\nsurrogate measures of outcome, such as bio-\nchemical measures of dialysis adequacy, rather than\nparameters directly relevant to patients, such as\nquality of life, treatment complications and survival.\nThis latter consideration applied, in particular, to\ncrossover design trials. In a chronic condition such\nas ESRD, randomised crossover designs appear\nattractive but their value is limited because they\ncannot be used to assess the longer-term conse-\nquences of alternative approaches to care.\nThe style of the trials was therefore explanatory\nrather than pragmatic. They tended to test specific\nhypotheses about efficacy, rather than compare the\neffectiveness of alternative policies for dialysis, which\nincorporate changes in management when clinically\nindicated. Whereas explanatory trials are useful for\nexploring new developments in dialysis in an \u2018ideal\u2019\nsetting, they are of limited value for assessing alterna-\ntive approaches to dialysis that might be used within\nthe NHS in terms of outcomes, including costs, that\nare most important to patients, providers and\npurchasers. Pragmatic designs are needed for this.\nAn important point to consider in an economic\nevaluation is that costs are subject to economies \nof scale. Generally speaking, the more units of \na product that are purchased the cheaper the \nunit price becomes. In the economics analyses\ncontained in this report, this has been taken into\naccount by using, where possible, average selling\nprices which tend to be less than manufacturers\u2019\nquoted \u2018list\u2019 prices. However, this provides only \nan indication of possible economies of scale. For\nany local situation, information on resource use\ncontained in each of the economic evaluations \ncan be combined with local data on prices. One\ncan then judge whether the local costs are worth\nthe benefits that they provide.\nReflecting our wish to inform patient care within\nthe NHS, the systematic reviews have incorporated\neconomic evaluations. Although it is important to\ndetermine which interventions are most effective, \nit is increasingly widely recognised that this must \nbe balanced against the relative costs and cost con-\nsequences of alternative interventions. An economic\nevaluation relates cost to effectiveness. The RCTs\nappropriate to our topics, although providing \nsome information on effectiveness, were found \nnot to provide adequate costing data to allow a \nfull evaluation to be made. In our economic eval-\nuations, data from the reviews of randomised trials\nwere used, where possible, to estimate resource \nuse associated with the initial interventions and\ndifferential rates of measures of effectiveness with\nresource consequences (expressed as adverse\nevents, such as complications). When such data\nwere not available, use was made of cost data from\nthe less methodologically rigorous studies identified\nby our separate \u2018economics literature search\u2019.\nThese studies were also used to obtain estimates \nof the magnitude of resources used in each option\nevaluated (unless more accurate data could be\nobtained from UK-based costings).

Although \nthis is a recognised issue in economic terms8 there\nare insufficient data available to perform reliable\nsubgroup analyses. The framework developed \nand the information presented currently provide,\ntherefore, the best available evidence on which \nto base judgements about treatments in \ndefinable subgroups.\nIn certain of the economic evaluations, the analysis\nis constrained because the \u2018lifetime\u2019 costs of treat-\nment have not been identified. The economic\nevaluation of alternative forms of CAPD delivery\nsystems was the principal evaluation where this type\nof cost data would have been useful. Unfortunately,\nthe necessary data on, for example, the prob-\nabilities of patients dying or switching modalities\nwere not available, and it was considered that \nthis information could not be abstracted in a\nsufficiently robust form from a non-randomised\nstudy to make extending the analysis in this way\nworthwhile. However, when reliable data were\nobtainable and the type of analysis was appropriate,\nfor example, for the comparison of CAPD and\nCCPD, patient lifetime costs were calculated.\nFor all the reasons outlined above, the value \nof this work is limited by the material available \nto us from relevant previous primary research.\nNevertheless, the reviews do provide clear guid-\nance for patients, providers and purchasers on\nsome of the six key decisions:\n\u2022 choice of dialysate for haemodialysis\n\u2022 duration of haemodialysis\n\u2022 choice of catheter in CAPD\nand provide a basis for an informed decision \nwhere a judgement has to be made between\npossible greater effectiveness and greater cost:\n\u2022 choice of membrane for haemodialysis\n\u2022 use of CCPD.\nThey also demonstrate to those who commission\nand perform research where further research \nis needed:\n\u2022 choice of membrane for haemodialysis\n\u2022 duration of haemodialysis\n\u2022 further evaluation of CCPD\n\u2022 choice between haemodialysis and CAPD as the\ninitial modality for patients starting dialysis.\nAs indicated earlier, information about effective-\nness and efficiency is necessary but not sufficient\nwhen making decisions about health care. We have\nalready alluded to the changing health needs of the\npopulation served by the NHS and the particular\nrequirements and preferences of some of the\npatients with ESRD. Data from renal registries\ndescribing those currently receiving long-term\ndialysis and their management will clarify the\napplicability of our findings and the potential for\nchange. For example, bicarbonate as a buffer in\nhaemodialysis is already used in most renal units.\nThere may be criticisms that much time and effort\nhas been used in some of these reviews to confirm\nwhat clinicians have felt about some aspects of\ntreatment for some time; again, the use of bicar-\nbonate is an example. A formal systematic review,\nhowever, can give that argument conviction, set it\nin the context of cost and prevent further expen-\nsive unnecessary studies being carried out. When\nthe review began, scarcely any similar work had\nbeen carried out in the subject area of renal\ndisease, particularly ESRD. Our group was truly\nmultidisciplinary including nephrologists, health\nservices researchers, health economists and\nlibrarians and information officers. The whole\ngroup met weekly and we consider that this\nsuccessful integration of the various types of\nexpertise and skills is manifest in this report.\nDespite the involvement of experienced health\nservice researchers, nephrologists and health\neconomists, it took time to define the best search\nstrategy and we were surprised that our search\nyielded as many as 12,000 abstracts. This sort of\nexercise will, however, be significantly easier in \nthe future. The Cochrane Collaboration will be\nperforming broad searches of all the principal\nelectronic databases for all RCTs, irrespective \nof subject area. Possible RCTs identified in this \nway will contribute to a new register (CENTRAL)\nwithin the Cochrane Library and so, in the future,\nit will only be necessary for groups of researchers \nto search the CENTRAL register for trials relevant\nto a particular subject area. We do plan to dis-\nseminate our findings actively. The reviews are\nlikely to have the greatest influence on \nprofessional groups.\nNephrologists have The Renal Association \nas a platform for dissemination and discussion, \nand the Department of Health and its equivalents Discussion\n26\nat the Scottish and Northern Ireland Offices \nalso have wide-ranging information \ndissemination systems.\nThe Renal Association (in conjunction with the\nRoyal College of Physicians of London) has pro-\nduced a document, Treatment of adult patients with\nrenal failure \u2013 recommended standards and outcome\nmeasures.18 The results of systematic reviews such \nas this should, after discussion with all interested\ngroups, inform these standards. Similarly, we hope\nthat our findings will influence any later versions \nof the recently published Review of renal services \nin England by the Department of Health19 and\nappear in peer-reviewed journals. In this way the\nevidence gathered is more likely to be put into\npractice, and the process will be seen not as a\nthreat but as an opportunity to provide optimum\ncare for patients with ESRD.\nThis work is not seen as a \u2018once-and-for-all\u2019\nexercise. The six reviews will be submitted for\npublication in the Cochrane Database of Systematic\nReviews, and regularly updated thereafter as new\nevidence becomes available. Also, the other RCTs\nthat have been identified in the broad searches \nwill be contributed to the Cochrane Collaboration,\nthus facilitating the systematic review of RCTs \nof other aspects of dialysis.\nThe project has highlighted the paucity of RCTs\nthat usefully inform the key issues on the effective-\nness and, hence, provision of NHS dialysis services\nfor ESRD that were identified in the original com-\nmissioning brief. Ideally, the NHS needs evidence\nfrom large pragmatic trials comparing the manage-\nment policies used in many renal units over a range\nof types of patient. This will require a culture shift\naway from the current explanatory style of research,\ninvestigating underlying mechanisms of dialysis in\nsmall groups of patients in single centres, to simply\ndesigned collaborative trials evaluating the longer-\nterm impact of alternative dialysis policies on\npatients and the health service.Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n27\nT\nhose reviews were supported by the \nNHS R&D Executive\u2019s Health Technology\nAssessment Programme.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the\nconsiderable help of staff in the Medical School\nLibrary of the University of Aberdeen.\nWe would also like to thank Dr Iain Chalmers and\nthe staff of the UK Cochrane Centre for their\nadvice prior to the formation of the Cochrane\nRenal Review Group.\nThe authors also acknowledge the contribution of\nMs Elizabeth Kirby, who performed the Markov\nmodelling presented in appendix 9.\nFinally, we also owe our thanks to the referees for\ntheir perseverance in reading the report and the\nquality of their comments.\nAcknowledgementsHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n29\n1.

It has \nbeen adapted from Renal purchasing guidelines \nEL 96\/35, published by the NHS Executive in \nMay 1996, and is reproduced with permission.\nRenal disease\nDiseases of the kidney are not as common as \nother important diseases such as cardiovascular\nconditions or cancers but are much more \ncommon than some well-known disorders such \nas multiple sclerosis or muscular dystrophy. Renal\nconditions account for about 7000 deaths per\nannum (Registrar General\u2019s figures) not includ-\ning cancers of the kidney and associated organs \nof the urinary tract such as bladder and prostate.\nHowever, around one-third of deaths of people\nwith renal failure are not recorded as such in \nthe death data, and in many cases \u2013 especially \nthe elderly \u2013 there are associated illnesses which\npreclude the institution of RRT.\nOver 100 different diseases affect the kidneys. \nThese diseases may present early with features \nsuch as pain, blood or protein in the urine or \nperipheral oedema (swelling in the legs), or \nmay remain undiagnosed until the patient \nrecovers or the symptoms of renal failure develop.\nMuch renal disease is self-limiting and often \noccurs and heals with few, if any, symptoms \nor sequelae.\nRenal failure may be acute and reversible, which\noccurs in previously normal kidneys after major\ninjury such as crush injuries or major surgery, \nin the presence of overwhelming infection, or \nif the blood supply to the kidneys is compromised\nby failure of the heart\u2019s pumping action, or \nlosses of blood, salt or water so that the blood\npressure drops and the kidneys are no longer\nsupplied with blood. In this case, renal support \nis needed only for days or weeks before renal\nfunction returns. However, about half such \npatients die during the illness because of \nother conditions.\nMore common is chronic irreversible renal failure\nin which the kidneys are slowly destroyed over\nmonths or years. Chronic irreversible renal failure\nslowly erodes kidney function. To begin with there\nis little to see or find, and many patients present \nfor medical help late in their disease, or even in \nthe terminal stages. Tiredness, anaemia, a feeling\nof being \u2018run down\u2019 are often the only symptoms,\nplus headache, breathlessness and perhaps angina\nif high blood pressure is present \u2013 as happens \noften as the kidneys fail, or as the prime cause \nof the renal disease (ESRD). Ankle swelling \nmay occur if the loss of protein in the urine \nis particularly great.\nThe stages of chronic irreversible renal failure are\noften given different terms: chronic renal insuffi-\nciency for the early stages, chronic renal failure\nwhen it has become obvious, and end-stage renal\nfailure when it reaches its terminal stages. At this\npoint if nothing is done the patient will die.\nTwo forms of treatment are available, however,\nwhich are complementary to each other and may\nboth be needed if end-stage renal failure is to be\ntreated \u2013 dialysis and renal transplantation.\nEthnicity and age are considered to be the key\nsocio-demographic determinants of ESRD. There \nis cogent evidence that the incidence of ESRD\nincreases significantly with age. While not achiev-\ning European levels, the trend in the UK has been\nfor older patients to be accepted, resulting in the\nrising age-profile of new patients in recent years.\nEvidence from the USA suggests that the relative\nrisk of ESRD in the black population (predomi-\nnantly of African origin) is two to four times higher\nthan for whites.\n1 Data collected during the Review\nof Renal Specialist Services in London suggest that\nthere is a similar increased risk of renal failure in\nthe ethnic populations (Asian and Afro-Caribbean)\nin the Thames Regions compared with whites.\n2\nPeople from both of these groups have a higher\nprevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes and\npatients in these groups with diabetes are more\nlikely to develop renal failure than whites. This\npartly explains the higher acceptance rate of \nAsians on to RRT programmes.\nAppendix 1\nBackground information on ESRD \nand treatmentAppendix 1\n32\nCategories of renal disease\nMost renal diseases that cause renal failure fall into\na few categories, including the following.\nAutoimmune disease\n\u2018Glomerulonephritis\u2019 describes a group of diseases\nin which the glomeruli (the filters which start the\nprocess of urine formation) are damaged by the\nbody\u2019s immunological response to tissue changes \nor infections elsewhere. Together, all forms of\nnephritis account for about 30% of renal failure \nin Britain. The most severe forms are therefore\ntreated with medications that suppress the immune\nresponse; however, treatment makes only a small\nimpact on the progress of this group of patients\ninto ESRD.\nSystemic disease\nAlthough many generalised diseases such as\nsystemic lupus, vasculitis, amyloidosis and myelo-\nmatosis can cause kidney failure, by far the most\nimportant cause is diabetes mellitus (about 20% \nof all renal disease in many countries). In some\npatients, progressive kidney damage begins after\nsome years of diabetes, particularly if blood sugar\nand high blood pressure have been poorly con-\ntrolled. This is a particularly common and severe\nproblem in patients from the Indian subcontinent.\nCareful lifelong supervision has a major impact \nin preventing kidney damage.\nHigh blood pressure\nSevere (accelerated) hypertension damages the\nkidneys but the damage can be prevented, and to\nsome extent reversed, by early detection and early\ntreatment of high blood pressure. In patients of Afro-\nCaribbean origin, hypertension is frequently the only\npresumptive causative factor of renal failure. The\nrelationship between high blood pressure and the\nkidney is being studied to see to what extent treat-\nment to bring blood pressure to normal levels might\nreduce the incidence of ESRD in such target groups.\nIt is possible that other factors are also involved.\nObstruction\nAnything which obstructs the free flow of urine can\ncause back-pressure on the kidneys. Much the com-\nmonest cause is enlargement of the prostate in eld-\nerly men; although only a small proportion of them\ndevelop kidney failure, benign prostatic hyperplasia\n(BPH) is so common that it becomes a major cause\nof renal failure over the age of 70 years.\nInfection of the urine\nCystitis is a very common condition affecting about\nhalf of all women at some time in their life and\nrarely has serious consequences. Infection of the\nurine in young children or patients with obstruc-\ntion and other abnormalities of the urinary tract \nor kidney stones may result in scarring of the\nkidney and eventual kidney failure.\nGenetic disease\nOne common disease \u2013 polycystic kidney disease\n(PKD) \u2013 and many rare inherited diseases affecting\nthe kidneys account for about 8% of all kidney\nfailure in Britain. Although present from birth,\nPKD often causes no symptoms until middle age or \nlater. Understanding of its genetic basis is rapidly\nadvancing and may lead to the development of\neffective treatment.\nPrevention of renal failure\nPrevention of chronic irreversible renal failure is\nnot often possible, but better control of diabetes\nand high blood pressure and relief of obstruction\nhave much to offer, provided that the condition\ncan be recognised early in the course of the\ndisease, before much renal damage has occurred.\nScreening for renal diseases has not been practised,\nbecause of the relatively low incidence of cases.\nUrine tests for protein or blood, or blood tests for\nthe level of some substances normally excreted by\nthe kidney such as creatinine and urea, are poten-\ntially useful methods for screening if populations \nat risk of renal failure can be identified.\nThe earliest possible assessment of patients likely to\nneed RRT provides the greatest cost-effectiveness.\nThis is reinforced by the growing awareness that\nmedical and other complications frequently arise\ncaused by factors which could have been detected \nand modified if there had been time for assess-\nment. The surveillance of at-risk groups in general\npractice might assist by bringing patients who will\nrequire RRT to the attention of nephrologists as\nearly as possible. Hospital doctors in all specialities\nshould be aware that mild renal failure requires\nprompt assessment by a nephrologist.\nRenal failure is often accompanied by other disease\nprocesses. Some of these are due to the primary\ndisease; for example, diabetes causes renal failure,\nblindness and diseases of the nerves and blood\nvessels. Others, such as anaemia, bone disease \nand heart failure are consequences of the renal\nfailure. Coincidental diseases such as cardiovascular\ndiseases, peripheral vascular disease, chronic\nbronchitis and arthritis are particularly common \nin older patients with renal failure. All theseHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n33\nconditions (called collectively \u2018co-morbidity\u2019) can\ninfluence the choice of treatment for renal failure\nand may reduce its benefits. Expert assessment of\nthe patient before ESRD can reduce co-morbidity\nand increase the benefit and cost-effectiveness \nof treatment. Thus early detection and referral \nof patients at risk of renal failure is important.\nEvidence from the USA showed that the mortality\nrate among patients aged over 55 years at the \nstart of regular dialysis increased dramatically if\ndialysis was started late in the illness.3 Studies of\npatients in the UK confirm this.\nRenal replacement therapy\nThe term RRT is used to describe those treatments\nfor ESRD where, in the absence of kidney function,\nthe removal of waste product from the body is\nachieved by dialysis and other kidney functions \nare supplemented by drugs. It is also the term\nwhich covers the complete replacement of all\nkidney functions by transplantation. Patients \nwith ESRD usually change treatment modalities\nduring their time on RRT. They may begin with \none form of dialysis, change to another and \nthen receive a transplant; if the transplant fails \nthey return again to dialysis. The modalities \nof treatment can therefore be seen as\ncomplementary.\nDialysis\nDialysis involves the cleansing or washing of the\nblood by the use of fluids which allow the toxic\nsubstances to leave the body by a route other than\nthe kidneys; in addition it is possible to regulate \nthe composition of the body fluids and the amount\nof water and salts in the body by altering the com-\nposition of the fluids used, and by pressure or \nother forms of filtration.\nThe method used first to achieve dialysis was \nthe artificial kidney, or haemodialysis. This \ninvolves the attachment of the patient\u2019s circu-\nlation to a machine through which fluid is passed\nand exchanged can take place. The disadvantage \nof this method is that some form of permanent\naccess to the circulation must be produced \nwhich can be needled at every treatment. Each\nsession lasts 4\u20136 hours and is needed three \ntimes a week.\nThe alternative is peritoneal dialysis, often carried\nout in the form of CAPD. In this technique, fluid is\ninfused and withdrawn from the peritoneal cavity\nwhich lies around the bowel; the washing fluid\nmust be sterile, and peritonitis (infection and\ninflammation of the peritoneum) is a frequent\ncomplication. A silastic tube must be implanted\ninto the peritoneum, and this may become kinked\nor malpositioned. The fluid is exchanged four\ntimes daily and hence remains in the abdominal\ncavity for about 4\u20135 hours during the day and \nfor 8 hours overnight. More recently automated\nperitoneal dialysis has been introduced in \nwhich exchanges are carried out overnight \nby a machine and no exchanges are required \nduring the day.\nNeither form of dialysis corrects the loss of\nhormones secreted by the kidney and replace-\nment with synthetic EPO and vitamin D is \noften necessary.\nRenal transplantation\nRenal transplantation replaces all the functions \nof the kidney, making EPO and vitamin D unneces-\nsary. A single kidney is placed usually in the pelvis\nclose to the bladder, and attached to a nearby\nartery and vein. The immediate problem is the\nbody\u2019s acute rejection of the foreign graft, which\nhas largely been overcome during the first months\nusing drugs such as steroids and cyclosporin. \nThese drugs and other which can be used have\nmany undesirable side-effects, including the\nacceleration of vascular disease so that myocardial\ninfarcts and strokes are commoner in transplant\npatients than in age-matched controls. During\nsubsequent years also, there is a steady loss of\ntransplanted kidneys from a process of chronic\nrejection; treatment of this is unsatisfactory and\nmany patients require a second or even third \ngraft over several decades, and have to rely \non dialysis in the meantime.\nThe main bar to expanding transplantation is \nthe shortage of suitable kidneys to transplant.\nAlthough the situation could be improved, it \nis now clear that whatever social and medical\nstructures are present or legislation is adopted,\nthere will be inevitably be a significant shortage \nof kidneys from humans. This remains the case\neven if kidneys from the newly dead (cadaver\nkidneys) are retrieved with maximum efficiency,\nand living donors (usually, but not always, from\nclose blood-relatives of the recipient) are used\nwherever appropriate. Experiments using \nanimal kidneys are under way but are still in \nthe early stages. It will be some time before \nwe know whether xenotransplantation, as thisAppendix 1\n34\nprocedure is known, will contribute to the\ntransplant programme.\nThe nature of renal services\nThe nature of the work in renal medicine is\nextremely varied. The work of a nephrologist\nincludes the early detection and diagnosis of renal\ndisease and the long-term management of its com-\nplications such as high blood pressure, anaemia,\nand bone disease. The nephrologist may share the\nmanagement with the general practitioner or local\nhospital physician, and relies on them to refer a\npatient early for initial diagnosis and treatment.\nInpatient work accounts for perhaps 5% of patients\nunder care at any one time but is complex, and\nexperienced medical advice must be available on a\n24-hour basis. About 95% of renal work is sustained\non an outpatient basis; this includes most RRT by\ndialysis and the care of transplant patients. There\nare four major components to renal medicine.\nRenal replacement therapy\nThe most significant element of work is in relation\nto the preparation of patients in ESRD for RRT.\nOnce accepted there is a requirement for medical\nsupervision for the remainder of the patient\u2019s life.\nThere is demographic evidence that the patient\npopulation will present increasing challenges for\nrenal staffing as more elderly and diabetic patients\nare accepted for treatment.\nEmergency work\nThe emergency work associated with the specialist\nconsists of the following.\n\u2022 The treatment of acute renal failure, often\ninvolving multi-organ failure, and acute-on-\nchronic renal failure. Close cooperation with\nother medical specialities including intensive\ncare is therefore a vital component of this \naspect of the service.\n\u2022 There is a significant workload of medical\nemergencies arising from an ESRD programme\nwhich is bound to increase in proportion to the\ndemands on the main programme.\nRoutine nephrology\nThere is a significant workload associated with \nthe immunological and metabolic nature of renal\ndisease which requires investigative procedures \nin an inpatient setting.\nInvestigation and management of fluid\nand electrolyte disorders\nThis is variable proportion of the nephrologist\u2019s\nwork, depending on the other expertise available \nin the hospital.\nOutpatient work\nThe outpatient work in renal medicine consists \nof the majority of general nephrology, together\nwith clinics attended by dialysis and renal\ntransplant patients.\nAcute uraemic emergencies\nUp to 40% of patients requiring RRT present at the\ntime when dialysis is needed; this constitutes an acute\nuraemic emergency, since only immediate therapy\nwill save life. Any such patient should receive appro-\npriate assessment and treatment, and renal units\nmust have the facilities to deal with them. However,\nother patients with potentially reversible renal failure\nwho present in this way eventually recover renal\nfunction and do not require long-term RRT. It is\nimpossible to distinguish immediately between cases\nin which recovery will occur and those in which it will\nnot, and clinicians need time to assess this. Even if\nrenal function cannot be recovered, there may be\nother reasons for not proceeding to long-term RRT,\nand time is required for this to be determined.\nResearch\nRenal disease has become a defined sub-speciality\nonly within the last 30 years but the kidney has\nstimulated academic interest for much longer due \nto its central role on metabolism, hypertension and\nimmunological disease. The MRC, Wellcome Trust\nand the National Kidney Research Fund spend annu-\nally over \u00a33 million in departments with an interest in\nrenal medicine, renal physiology and transplantation.\nReferences\n1.

In \nthis appendix the authors describe:\n\u2022 how they were first identified\n\u2022 how many were judged to be possible RCTs\nrelevant to RCTs relevant to ESRD\n\u2022 how many of these were concerned with the \nsix specific topics chosen for review\n\u2022 how many were confirmed as RCTs suitable \nfor inclusion\n\u2022 how many were considered in the \neconomic analyses.\nSince no previous work whatsoever has been\nundertaken in the area of ESRD, it was considered\nthat a broad search was appropriate and would be\nuseful for the Cochrane Renal Review Group\u2019s\nregister of trials.\nResults of searches for RCTs for\nassessing effectiveness\nThe number of abstracts of possibly relevant studies\ngenerated by the systematic searches of the five\nelectronic databases are shown in Figure 8. In total,\nof nearly 12,000 abstracts assessed, 2085 were\nthought to be possible RCTs or quasi-RCTs and, of\nthese, 340 were later judged on review of the full\nreport to be RCTs or quasi-RCTs related to the\nmanagement of ESRD. A total of 39 were relevant\nto one or more of the six topics. The dividend from\neach of the five databases is shown in Table 4. Of \nthe 39 RCTs found, 34 (87%) were identified on\nMedline. The next largest number came from\nEmbase but the dividend expressed as a proportion\nof abstracts identified was low (about 1\/1000).\nThe number of trials relevant to individual reviews\nvaried (Table 5). The largest number were com-\nparisons of haemodialysis membranes. No RCTs\nwere found for what is arguably the most import-\nant review, the comparison of haemodialysis \nwith CAPD.\nThe sources of the eight additional RCTs included\nin the reviews are summarised in Table 6.\nAlthough trials related to the management of\nESRD were found in other databases and during\nhand-searching of Kidney International, none of\nthese were included in any of the six reviews as \nthey did not fit the eligibility criteria.

Of a total of 223 possible RCTs or CCTs,\n107 were relevant to ESRD, 68 were not identified\nin the electronic searches and 33 were thought to\nbe relevant to one or more of the six topics.\nHowever, none of these were RCTs which reported\ndata relevant to any of the predetermined outcome\nmeasures and therefore none of these studies were\nincluded in the reviews.\nThe results of the handsearching of the confer-\nence proceedings in Kidney International for the\nyear 1994 are presented in Table 8. Although \n15 possible RCTs were relevant to the six topics,\nnone were included in the final reviews. However,\nthe handsearching will contribute to the inter-\nnational Cochrane Collaboration work and help\nidentify all RCTs and quasi-RCTs. Of the articles \nin Medline, 129 were incorrectly tagged and will \nbe re-tagged by the National Library of Medicine\n(USA) as RCTs or CCTs. In addition, the 64 RCTs\nand CCTs identified in the conference proceed-\nings, which are not normally indexed in Medline,\nwill be included on a new auxiliary Medline\ndatabase currently under development.\nTable 9 is a summary of where the 47 RCTs included\nin the reviews were identified; 34 (72%) were\nidentified from Medline.\nMost of the studies identified in the supplementary\neconomics searches were found in Medline and\nEmbase (Table 10). In contrast to the findings for\nRCTs, the largest number were relevant to the\ncomparison of haemodialysis and CAPD \n(Table 11).\nTABLE 4  Number of studies identified at each stage of the

and quasi-RCTs\nfrom \u2018definite\u2019RCTs.Possible RCTs include trials that do not state the method of allocation but have treatment and control groups derived from a single\ngroup of participants.Examples of quasi-random processes for assigning treatments are coin flips,odd-even numbers,patients\u2019social security numbers,\ndays of the week,and patient record numbers.This conforms with the National Library of Medicine (USA) definition of an RCT.\n2 RCT.If the trial meets the four eligibility criteria (given below) and the author(s) state explicitly (usually by using some variant of the term \u2018random\u2019to\ndescribe the allocation procedure used) that the groups compared in the study were established by random allocation.This conforms with the National\nLibrary of Medicine (USA) definition of an RCT.Eligibility criteria:the study compares treatment in human beings;the study is prospective in nature,i.e.\nthe interventions are planned prior to the experiment taking place,and exposure to each intervention is under the control of the study investigators;\ntwo or more treatments or interventions are compared with one another (one may be a no-treatment control group);and the most important aspect is\nthat assignment to a particular intervention is intended to be random,i.e.not deliberately selected in any way.Units of randomisation may be\nindividuals,groups (communities,schools,or hospitals),organs or other parts of the body (such as teeth).\n3The years used to obtain the \u2018gold standard\u2019.\n(Footnotes 1 and 2 are based on

cannot be excret-\ned. The principle of haemodialysis is that such sub-\nstances can be removed when blood is passed over\na semi-permeable membrane with dialysate flowing\non the other side. Metabolites are removed mainly\nby diffusion and water by applying a pressure\ngradient across the membrane.\nCellulose-based membranes are produced \nprincipally from cotton. They were the first\nmembranes produced for dialysis and in their\nstandard form have a low hydraulic permeability \n(< 10 ml\/h\/m\n2\/mmHg) and are commonly \nknown as low-flux membranes. They character-\nistically also have poor clearance of molecules\nlarger in size than urea and creatinine, which \nmay be responsible for some of the clinical \nfeatures of uraemia. In recent years, standard\ncellulose membranes have been modified to \nmake both larger molecule and water removal\nmore efficient; such membranes are called\nmodified cellulose, substituted cellulose or \nsemi-synthetic membranes and can more readily \nbe made to have a higher flux than cellulose\nmembranes. They are generally more expensive\nthan standard membranes.\nIn the early 1970s, synthetic polymer-based\nmembranes became available which could be\nmanufactured to have either high- or low-flux\ncharacteristics. They may remove b2 micro-\nglobulin, a middle molecule which may cause\ndialysis-related amyloid disease, more effectively,\nparticularly those which have a high flux. Such\nmembranes have been used by those wishing to\nreduce the number of hours in a dialysis session.\nSynthetic membranes are also regarded as more\n\u2018biocompatible\u2019, in that they incite less of an\nimmune response than cellulose-based membranes.\nDialysis membranes can be cleaned or \u2018repro-\ncessed\u2019 after use and reused for the same patient.\nThis practice is more common for the more\nexpensive synthetic membranes.\nThe greater stimulation of the immune system by\nthe cellulose membranes may increase patients\u2019\nsusceptibility to infection and malnutrition, and\nmay also, through production of cytokines and\nstimulation of the complement system, be partially\nresponsible for the adverse symptoms experienced\nduring haemodialysis. It is of particular import-\nance to evaluate the benefits of synthetic mem-\nbranes, since they are generally about three to \nfour times more expensive than cellulose or modi-\nfied cellulose membranes. Despite the economic\nand practical importance of the choice of dialysis\nmembrane, it is not clear to nephrologists or\nhealthcare purchasers what the benefits of synthetic\nmembranes are and, if benefits do exist, whether\ntheir extra cost can be justified.\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this review are:\n\u2022 to determine whether synthetic membranes offer\nclinically important advantages compared with\nstandard or modified cellulose membranes in\nthe haemodialysis of patients with ESRD\n\u2022 to determine from the literature the resource-\nuse implications of biocompatible membranes\nand to relate this to measures of effectiveness \nin an economic analysis.\nMaterials and methods\nCriteria for considering studies for \nthis review\nTypes of studies  An attempt was made to identify\nall trials which compared synthetic haemodialysis\nmembranes with those made with cellulose or\nmodified cellulose.\nTypes of participants  Any patient maintained on\nor commencing haemodialysis for ESRD.\nTypes of intervention  Any RCT or quasi-RCT\ncomparing any (or several) synthetic haemodialysis\nAppendix 4\nSystematic review 1: Comparison of synthetic \nwith cellulose and modified cellulose membranes in\nthe haemodialysis of patients with ESRDAppendix 4\n46\nmembranes with any (or several) cellulose or\nmodified cellulose haemodialysis membranes.\nTypes of outcome measures\n1.

Mortality.\nSearch strategy for identification \nof studies\nThe search strategy used was one developed for \nthe identification of all possible RCTs or quasi-\nRCTs relating to the management of ESRD, and is\ndescribed in detail in chapter 2 and appendices 2\nand 3.\nMethods of the review\nAll possible RCTs identified on this topic were\nevaluated using a study evaluation form and those\nwhich met the eligibility criteria (included studies)\nwere then considered in detail. Data were extracted\nusing a data abstraction form designed for this\nreview (see appendix 10). Review Manager v. 3.0\nwas used for the analysis. A full description of the\nmethods used is given in chapter 2.\nDescription of studies\nA total of 21 studies were identified that met the\neligibility criteria of being RCTs or quasi-RCTs\n(Table 12). The descriptions of method of allocation\npublished were accepted, and author confirmation\nwas not sought. All studies included have been\npublished in complete form. Clarification from the\nauthors (Schaefer et al., 1993) of the number of\ndialysis treatments with each type of membrane \nwas sought and obtained, so that the number of\nepisodes of anaphylaxis per dialysis session could\nbe calculated and entered into Meta-view. A total \nof 23 trials were excluded because the outcomes\nwere not relevant to this review, and four were\nexcluded because the comparison was not between\ncellulose and synthetic membranes.\nMethodological quality of studies included\nOf the 21 studies included (Table 12), ten were\nparallel group randomised trials and 12 were\nrandomised or quasi-randomised crossover studies.\nPotential for selection bias at trial entry\nThe reports of all 21 studies stated that the order \nof treatment had been randomly allocated. In 16 \nof these, the method of random allocation used \nwas not described. A secure method of random\nallocation concealment prior to final trial entry\n(third party or computer randomisation) was used\nin three trials (Aakhus et al., 1995; Grooteman \net al., 1995; Locatelli et al., 1996); three others\n(Bergamo Collaboration, 1991; Parker et al., 1996)\nhad potentially insecure methods of random\nallocation concealment (coin toss with no stated\nthird party involvement and alternation).\nPotential for bias in trial analysis\nThe numbers and reasons for any withdrawals \nor drop-outs were described in six of the trials\n(Caramelo et al., 1994; Collins et al., 1993; Hakim \net al., 1996; Locatelli et al., 1995; Parker et al., \n1996; Schiffl et al., 1995); three (Levin et al., 1993;\nSkroeder et al., 1994; Ward et al., 1993) mentioned\nthe number of withdrawals and drop-outs but did\nnot give the reasons. The remaining 12 trials did\nnot mention withdrawals or drop-outs.\nOne trial (Parker et al., 1996) was carried out on an\nintention-to-treat basis and four (Caramelo et al.,\n1994; Collins et al., 1993; Hakim et al., 1996; Ward\net al., 1993) were not. In the remaining 16 trials, it\nwas not possible to determine whether analysis had\nbeen performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\nPotential for bias at time of treatment or\noutcome assessment\nIn three trials, blinding was mentioned; in one\n(Aakhus et al., 1995), the membranes were hidden\nby a covering from the patient and investigator \nand, in another (Danielson et al., 1986), the\npatients and healthcare workers were blinded \nbut the method of blinding was not given. There\nwas no blinding in the trial by Gardinali andHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n47\nTABLE 12  Characteristics of included studies\nStudy Method Participants Interventions Outcomes Notes\nAakhus,et al.,1995 Randomised crossover; Eight chronic dialysis  One dialysis session \u2013 Symptomatic  URR expressed as \nrandomisation by third  patients;age range, 1 hour haemodialysis, hypotension;URR; mean (standard deviation \nparty allocation;with- 24\u201373 years;M:F 1:1; 2 hours ultrafiltration \u2013 echo-cardiographic  (SD)).\ndrawals and drop-outs  inclusion and exclusion  with each membrane; data.\nnot mentioned;possibly  criteria not stated;co- membranes used:cupro- \nintention-to-treat  morbidity:two patients, phane (AM-65H-SD;\nanalysis;blinded effectively coronary artery disease; Asahi);Filtral 12 (AN69 \nfor patients and  one patient,diabetes; HF,Hospal);flux not \noutcomes assessors. none,ejection fraction  stated;surface area,not \n< 40%. stated;blood flow rate \nand dialysis flow rate not \nstated but kept constant;\nbuffer,bicarbonate;EPO,\nnot stated;ACE inhibitor,\none patient.\nBergamo  Randomised study with  428 patients from six  One dialysis with each  Hypotension requiring  Headaches,nausea,\nCollaboration,1991 an attempt at conceal- dialysis units who had  membrane,duration as  treatment;interdialytic  vomiting,pruritis \nment (tossing coin); undergone haemodialysis  usual for each patient  headache;interdialytic  recorded as improved,\nwithdrawals and drop- for ESRD for at least  (243 \u00b1 22 minutes, nausea and vomiting; unchanged or worse \nouts not mentioned; 1 month;mean age, cellulose;243 \u00b1 19, interdialytic pruritus; (post- compared with \npatients and healthcare  56.9 years,range  synthetic);vascular  interdialytic muscle  predialysis).No significant \nproviders well blinded to  17\u201379 years (synthetic); access,not stated;blood  cramps;b2 difference  between \ntreatment;no mention  55.9 years,range  flow rate,as usual for  microglobulin. membranes but data not \nof blinding for outcomes  19\u201380 years,cellulose; patient (mean,324 \u00b1 33, suitable for meta-analysis.\nassessors;intention-to- M:F 93:71,synthetic; synthetic;328 \u00b1 33, b2 microglobulin was \ntreat not clear.

The majority\nof trials were thus relatively recent and, for the\nmost part, described membranes in current use. \nTen studies commented on the co-morbid illnesses\npresent in the dialysis patients and eight excluded\npatients on the basis of co-morbidity, although the\nnature of the excluding conditions varied from\nstudy to study.\nIn some studies, it was not possible to derive \ndata for the outcome measure in question, either\nbecause outcomes were not given in numerical\nform at all or because they were not given in suffi-\ncient detail (e.g. means given without standard\ndeviations or standard errors). When this occurred\nit is described in the Results (below).\nResults\nFor the purpose of this review, when cellulose\nmembranes were compared with synthetic mem-\nbranes, the cellulose membranes were regarded \nas the controls.

A total of 22 outcome measures were\nsought in 11 broad areas. For two outcome meas-\nures (number of episodes of significant infections\nper year and quality of life) no data were available,\nand for one (URR), data were not presented in a\nform that could be analysed. For the comparison \nof cellulose with synthetic membranes, data on\n10\/19 outcome measures were available for only \na single trial; for modified cellulose and synthetic\nmembranes, four outcome measures were available\nin one trial, and for 12 outcomes no data were\nfound in any of the trials.\nThe results of the meta-analyses are presented in\nTable 13 (A and B).\nDialysis treatment associated \nwith symptomatic or treatment-\nrequiring hypotension\nData are available for seven trials that compare\ncellulose with synthetic membranes for this\noutcome measure. The number of dialysis sessions\nvaried from eight (Aakhus et al., 1995) to 1260\n(Collins et al., 1993) and this is reflected in the \nCIs; four trials included more than 100 dialysis\nsessions, and overall there is no evidence of\nsignificant heterogeneity within this group of \ntrials. One trial (Locatelli et al., 1996) reported\nsymptomatic hypotension, treatment-requiring \nand non-symptomatic hypotension, without\ndistinguishing between these three groups; these\nresults have not therefore been included in the\nmeta-analysis. The authors\u2019 own figures show no\nsignificant difference in hypotension between \nthose on cellulose and synthetic membranes \n(both were low-flux membranes). None of the\nindividual studies showed a statistically significant\ndifference between the membranes for this out-\ncome. Modified cellulose and synthetic membranes\nwere also compared for this outcome measure in\ntwo trials (Skroeder et al., 1994; Levin et al., 1993)\nand, again, there was no statistically significant\ndifference between the two membranes, nor was\nthere significant heterogeneity between the trials.\nTwo of the larger trials included patients with\ndiabetes (Collins et al., 1993; Bergamo Collabor-\nation, 1993) and two did not (Levin et al., 1993;\nQuerada et al., 1988).

for this study, data\nfrom staff reporting were entered into Meta-view in\nline with two other trials that used this outcome\nmeasure and which mentioned the method of\nreporting. The patients reported blood pressure\nproblems very much more frequently (143\/645\nsessions on synthetic membranes and 137\/422\nsessions on cellulose membranes; there was no\nmention of blinding of patients or staff) and if\nthese data had been used, the results of the study\nby Levin and colleagues would have achieved\nstatistical significance in favour of synthetic mem-\nbranes, although the overall results would just have\nfailed to reach significance. Patients also reported\nsymptoms more frequently when treated with\nmodified cellulose membranes (118\/428). Had\nthese results been entered, significantly fewer\nepisodes of symptomatic hypotension would have\nbeen reported with synthetic membranes for this\nstudy and for the overall meta-analysis.\nNumber of haemodialysis treatments\nassociated with headache\nFour trial reports include headache as an outcome\nmeasure. There was no evidence of significant\nheterogeneity between these trials and, overall,\nthere was no statistically significant difference be-\ntween cellulose and synthetic membranes. For this\noutcome, the patient-reported data from the study\nby Levin and colleagues (1993) were entered; had\nthe number of headaches reported by the staff\nbeen used (25\/645 synthetic and 7\/422 cellulose),\nthere would have been no change in the overall\nresult. Two papers compared modified cellulose\nmembranes with synthetic membranes; there was\nno evidence of significant heterogeneity between\nthe trials and no difference in the incidence \nof headaches.\nNumber of haemodialysis treatments\nassociated with nausea\/vomiting\nThree trials compared nausea and vomiting\nbetween cellulose and synthetic membranes. One\nvery small trial (Danielson et al., 1996) showed no\nepisodes of nausea or vomiting with either treat-\nment, and two other trials (Collins et al., 1993;\nLevin et al., 1993), using patient-reported data,\nshowed significantly less nausea and vomiting with\nsynthetic membranes. There was no evidence of\nheterogeneity between the trials and reflecting \nthis, the overall effect confirmed significantly less\nnausea and vomiting when a synthetic membrane\nwas used (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49, 0.78). \u2018Numbers-\nneeded-to-treat\u2019 (NNT) analysis indicated that in \n31 (95% CI, 20, 78) dialysis sessions there would \nbe one fewer episode of nausea or vomiting using \na synthetic membrane.\nOnly one trial compared modified cellulose with\nsynthetic membranes (Levin et al., 1993) and no\nTABLE 13B contd  Synthetic vs.cellulose\/modified cellulose haemodialysis membranes:detailed meta-analysis\nStudy Patient Control Peto OR Weight Peto OR\nn\/N n\/N (95% CI fixed) (%) (95% CI fixed)\nMortality\nCellulose membrane\nLocatelli,1996 12\/147 8\/132 56.2 1.37 (0.55,3.40)\nParker,1996 8\/79 8\/80 43.8 1.01 (0.36,2.84)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 20\/226 16\/212 100.0 1.20 (0.61,2.37)\nChi-square 0.18 (df = 1) Z = 0.53\nModified cellulose membrane\nSubtotal (95% CI) 0\/0 0\/0 0.0 Not estimable\nChi-square 0.00 (df = 0) Z = 0.00\nTotal (95% CI) 20\/226 16\/212 100.0 1.20 (0.61,2.37)\nChi-square 0.18 (df = 1) Z = 0.53\n0.1 0.2 1 10\nFavours control Favours treatment\n5Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n63\nsignificant difference was found for this outcome.\nThis trial included patients with diabetes, although\nno other description of co-morbidity was given.\nMeta-analysis of the studies showed a significantly\nlower incidence of nausea and vomiting with\nsynthetic membranes compared with cellulose \nand modified cellulose membranes.\nNumber of haemodialysis treatments\nassociated with pruritus\nFour papers considered pruritus as an outcome\nmeasure. There was no evidence of heterogeneity\nand no overall significant differences between cellu-\nlose and synthetic membranes. Levin and colleagues\nstudy (1993), using patient-reported data, just failed\nto reach statistical significance in favour of synthetic\nmembranes. Two trials compared this outcome be-\ntween modified cellulose and synthetic membranes.\nThere was no evidence of significant heterogeneity\nand there was a significant difference in favour of\nsynthetic membranes in the trial by Levin and\ncolleagues and when the results of the two studies\nwere combined (NNT, 15; 95% CI, 8, 71). Although\nin the trial by Levin and colleagues, staff reported\nfewer cases of pruritis overall (22\/645 synthetic,\n19\/422 modified cellulose), the estimate of risk\nreduction (OR, 0.75) is similar to that derived from\npatient-reported symptoms. The overall estimate for\nall trials, for both cellulose and modified cellulose,\nshould be interpreted with caution because it is\nlargely dependent on a single trial (Levin et al.,\n1993) and the data from the group treated with\nsynthetic membranes in this trial were counted twice\nbecause it was a three group comparison.\nNumber of haemodialysis treatments\nassociated with anaphylaxis\nAnaphylaxis was mentioned in the reports of only\ntwo trials; a single case was reported among those\nmanaged with a synthetic membrane, and a single\ncase after use of a synthetic membrane. Patients on\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\nwere excluded from the trial by Schaefer and\ncolleagues (1993), and were not mentioned in \nthe earlier trial, carried out at a time when such\ndrugs were not readily available.\nNumber of haemodialysis treatments\nassociated with any adverse symptoms\nTwo papers commented on \u2018unspecified adverse\nsymptoms\u2019 in numerical form. One trial was very\nsmall and, overall, there was no evidence of any\ndifference. Another paper (Caramelo et al., 1994)\ncommented that there were no adverse symptoms\nin patients being treated with either membrane \nbut did not give any numerical data.\nNumber of patients who had an episode\nof significant infection\nRelevant data on infection were available for \nonly 15 patients (van Holder et al., 1992), of \nwhom three were reported to have had \nsignificant infections.\nNumber of hospital admissions per \nyear and number of days of hospital\nadmission per year\nThe large trial by Locatelli and colleagues (1996)\nwas the only one to report hospital admissions; \nno difference between cellulose and synthetic\nmembranes was found. The methodology of this\ntrial was well described but excluded many patients\nwith co-morbid illness, particularly cardiovascular\ndisease. The number of hospital admission days \nper year was also similar between the two groups.\nKt\/V\nTwo trials showed values for Kt\/V in patients\ntreated with cellulose or synthetic membranes;\nParker and colleagues (1996) showed a difference\nbetween the membranes that favoured the cellulose\nmembrane, Locatelli and colleagues (1996) did \nnot but excluded two patients with a Kt\/V value \nof < 0.95 (lower than required for inclusion in \nthe study). Both studies used low-flux membranes.\nMeta-analysis of these studies failed to show a sig-\nnificant benefit for either of these membranes for\nthis outcome measure. The trials did, however,\ndisplay heterogeneity, perhaps because of their\nexclusion criteria, different policies for reuse, \nand duration of dialysis session (not reported).\nOne trial compared Kt\/V for synthetic and\nmodified cellulose membranes (Grooteman et al.,\n1995). The lower value for the synthetic group is \nof borderline statistical significance; the flux, as\nmeasured by the ultrafiltration coefficient (UFc), \nof the two membranes was again reported by the\nauthors to be similar (UFc = 35, modified cellulose;\nUFc = 40, synthetic). \nMeta-analysis of all three studies just reached\nstatistical significance in favour of cellulose and\nmodified cellulose membranes.\nUrea reduction ratio\nOne trial (Ward et al., 1993), which compared\ncellulose, modified cellulose and synthetic mem-\nbranes, measured URR. However, standard devi-\nations were not given and the WMD could not be\ncalculated. When cellulose membranes were com-\npared with two synthetic membranes, the URR was\nslightly higher for those dialysing with cellulose\nmembranes (mean URR cellulose membrane, Appendix 4\n64\n60%; mean URRs synthetic, 55%, 54%). When a\nmodified cellulose membrane was compared with\nsynthetic membranes, the mean URR values were\n52%, 55% and 54%, respectively. The authors\nconcluded that the cellulose membrane had a\ngreater clearance than the others (p = 0.013).\nPredialysis b2 microglobulin \nserum concentration and amyloid\ndisease development\nFive groups measured predialysis b2 microglobulin\nserum concentrations at the beginning and \nend of their trials when comparing cellulose with\nsynthetic membranes; there was evidence of signifi-\ncant heterogeneity between studies, probably due\nto differences in flux. Overall, there was a signifi-\ncant decrease in b2 microglobulin values when\nsynthetic membranes were used. However, two\nstudies (Hakim et al., 1996; Locatelli et al., 1996)\nshowed no significant improvement with synthetic\nmembranes and they are characterised by the use\nof cellulose and synthetic membranes with a similar\nlow flux. The trials, which showed a significantly\nlower concentration of b2 microglobulin with the\nsynthetic membrane at the end of the study period,\nall compared high-flux synthetic membranes with\nlow-flux cellulose membranes. The trials varied in\nlength from 3 months (Gardinali et al., 1994) to 72\nmonths (Schiffl et al., 1995).\nIn one trial (Grooteman et al., 1995), modified\ncellulose membranes were compared with synthetic\nmembranes. There was no significant difference in\npredialysis b2 microglobulin serum concentration\nbetween these membranes, both of which had\nsimilar high-flux characteristics.\nIn a further trial, Schiffl and colleagues (1993)\ncompared the development of amyloid disease over\na 6-year period and found significantly less amyloid\ndisease occurring with the synthetic membranes\n(the sample size was, however, small); no cases \nof amyloid disease were seen using the synthetic\nmembrane. The authors point out again that the\nsynthetic membrane had a high UFc whereas \nthat for the cellulose membrane was low.\nPredialysis lipids\nIn one trial, Blankestijin and colleagues (1995)\nmeasured predialysis plasma total cholesterol, LDL\ncholesterol, HDL cholesterol and trigylcerides over a\n6-week period. Of these, only the serum triglyceride\nconcentration in the group assigned a synthetic\nmembrane was significantly lower. The synthetic\nmembrane had high-flux characteristics and the\ncellulose membrane low-flux characteristics. In\nanother study, Locatelli and colleagues (1996)\ncommented that there was no statistically significant\ndifference in plasma cholesterol or triglycerides in\npatients dialysed with cellulose or synthetic mem-\nbranes in the 24-month follow-up period of their\ntrial. Both these membranes were low flux.\nSerum albumin concentration\nThree trials reported serum albumin concentra-\ntions. In the largest, Parker and colleagues (1996)\nshowed a significantly higher mean level in the\ngroup using synthetic membranes and the overall\nestimate reflects this one trial. The trial by Blanken-\nstijn and colleagues (1995) excluded patients with\ndiabetes and that of Locatelli and colleagues (1996)\npatients who had had a recent myocardial infarct \nor who had a history of stroke or transient ischaemic\nattack. Parker and colleagues included patients \nwith diabetes in their trial. Meta-analysis of the \nthree studies showed a significant difference in\nserum albumin concentration in favour of \nsynthetic membranes.\nProtein catabolic rate\nPCR was only reported in one trial and there \nwas no significant difference between the\nmembranes used.\nMortality\nThe trials by Parker and colleagues (1996) and\nLocatelli and colleagues (1996) both had mortality\nas an outcome measure. The trial by Parker and\ncolleagues lasted 18 months and there were eight\ndeaths in each group. Locatelli and colleagues quote\ndeaths at their 24-month follow-up as 12\/147 (18%)\nin patients dialysed with low-flux synthetic mem-\nbranes and 8\/132 (12%) in those dialysed with cellu-\nlose membranes. In neither trial nor in the overall\nmeta-analysis was there a significant difference\nbetween cellulose and synthetic membranes.\nDiscussion\nOverall, this systematic review indicates that the\nincidence of nausea and vomiting was less with\nsynthetic than with cellulose membranes, and that\nthe incidence of pruritis was less with synthetic\nmembranes than with modified cellulose mem-\nbranes. Predialysis b2 microglobulin concentrations\nwere significantly lower at the end of the studies \nin patients treated with synthetic membranes also,\nalthough all studies which showed this effect used\nhigh-flux synthetic membranes. Similarly, one \nstudy showed the incidence of amyloid disease to\nbe less in patients who were dialysed for 6 years\nwith high-flux synthetic membranes. In the one\nstudy in which triglyceride values were measured,Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n65\nthere was a significant effect in favour of the\nsynthetic high-flux membrane. Serum albumin\nconcentrations were higher in patients treated with\nsynthetic membranes (of both high and low flux).\nThere was no significant difference between these\nmembranes for any other outcomes measures.\nMany types of membranes are now manufactured;\n128 \u2018commonly used dialysers\u2019 are currently listed\nin the Handbook of Dialysis (2nd edition; Daugirdas\n& Ing, 1994). They vary in surface area, clearance of\nvarious molecules, UFc, and geometry (hollow fibre\nor parallel plate) as well as in the material from\nwhich they are manufactured. Biocompatibility is\ngenerally believed to be a property of the material\nof the membrane and the higher the biocompati-\nbility, the fewer the blood\u2013membrane interactions\nreleasing complement and activating leucocytes.\nWhether such reactions lead to clinical sequelae\nsuch as malnutrition and infection is not clear\n(Bauremeister et al., 1989). Synthetic membranes\nare more biocompatible and have, therefore, \nbeen made with a larger surface area. They are \nalso generally more porous and, hence, suitable \nfor more rapid removal of water and molecules\nlarger than urea and creatinine, particularly b2\nmicroglobulin, persistently high concentrations \nof which are believed to result in the development\nof amyloid over a period of years in dialysis patients.\nThis correlation, however, is still in some doubt\n(Cheung, 1990). Synthetic membranes with high-\nflux characteristics and also, possibly, with an ability\nto absorb substances such as b2 microglobulin on\ntheir surfaces are used to shorten dialysis time; this\nis popular both with patients and with busy dialysis\nunits, although rapid fluid removal may result in\nhypotension. However, this was not shown in this\nreview. The beneficial effect of synthetic mem-\nbranes on serum albumin levels, however, occurred\nin trials using both high- and low-flux membranes. \nIt is somewhat disappointing, therefore, given the\nplethora of membranes and the claims made for\nthem, that more large well-planned RCTs which\ntake into account the material of the membrane\nand its flux have not been undertaken. In particu-\nlar, relatively few trials have been performed which\nused the outcome measures of symptoms felt \nby patients.\nA total of 22 RCTs were identified (Table 12) \nwhich had clinical outcome measures as their \nend-points, and some data from most of them have\ncontributed to this review. Levin and colleagues\u2019\ndetailed trial (1993) shows that a given symptom \nis recorded more frequently when patients rather\nthan staff are asked to undertake recording. We\nhad to choose which results to display, although\nboth were calculated for the four outcome meas-\nures. For hypotension, data from staff were shown;\npatient data favoured the synthetic membrane in\nthis study and the aggregated result almost achiev-\ned statistical significance. For the other outcomes\n(headache, nausea and vomiting, pruritis) patient-\nrecorded data were displayed, although the rela-\ntive risk reductions (ORs) were generally similar\nwhichever type of data were used. Most trials did\nnot mention the method of symptom recording.\nRecording of symptoms is subjective and in future\ntrials should be explicit and predominantly patient-\nbased, with blinding of the patients and the staff to\nthe treatment where possible.\nSignificant heterogeneity between trials was \nnoted for three outcome measures, most notably \nb2 microglobulin concentrations. This may have\nbeen because both low- and high-flux membranes\nwere used and significant improvement was only\nseen with synthetic membranes when high-flux\nmembranes were used. b2 microglobulin was used\nas a surrogate for amyloidosis, which takes many\nyears to develop, and in the one 6-year study found,\nthe incidence of amyloidosis was less with a high-\nflux synthetic membrane.\nThe co-morbid illnesses of patients taking part \nin the trials were mentioned in some but not all\nstudies. It is possible to argue that biocompatible\nmembranes may be more suitable for patients with\ncomplex illnesses but also that the low-flux, long\ndialysis carried out with cellulose membranes may\nalso be beneficial for some patients, particularly\nthose with cardiovascular instability. It would be\nuseful, given the increasing co-morbidity of dialysis\npatients, to be able to address these issues in\nsecondary stratified analysis but data to allow this\nare not currently available. It would be particularly\nuseful to study modified cellulose membranes\nwhich can be made with a higher flux than stand-\nard cellulose membranes (UFc, approximately 15)\nand synthetic membranes with a similar flux.\nTrials in which cellulose was compared with\nsynthetic membranes and for which Kt\/V was\nreported as an outcome measure were significantly\nheterogeneous. When cellulose and modified cellu-\nlose membranes together were compared with\nsynthetic membranes, Kt\/V was just significantly\nlower in the latter. Duration of dialysis session,\nhowever, was not given in all studies and this,\ntogether with the heterogeneity, makes it difficult\nto draw any conclusions. In one study, Hakim and\ncolleagues (1996) used inadequate Kt\/V in the \nfirst 2 weeks of the trial as an exclusion criterion,Appendix 4\n66\nalthough not as an outcome measure. Locatelli \nand colleagues (1996) excluded two patients\nbecause the Kt\/V value was < 0.95. Furthermore, \nin studies in which the methodology was described\nin some detail (Hakim et al., 1996; Locatelli et al.,\n1996) there was a large drop-out rate because \nof transfer of patients to another modality of\ndialysis, transplantation, transfer to another \ncentre, non-compliance and, in one study, not\nachieving an adequate Kt\/V. Variation within \nthe studies is, therefore, a major limitation \nof this review.\nThe management of end-stage renal failure is a\nhigh technology speciality for relatively few patients\nat great cost. Therefore, trials tend to be on small\ngroups of patients whose numbers are further\nreduced by the drop-out rates as detailed above.\nBecause of the high cost of dialysis, RCTs are a\nvaluable means of decision-making in this area.\nThey require, however, large numbers of patients\nwith prolonged follow-up, so that the longer-term\nimplications which are important to patients \ncan be adequately measured.\nSurrogate outcome measures such as complement\nlevels are more likely than primary outcome\nmeasures to change significantly over the course \nof a short study, are easier to measure and, hence,\nare more frequently undertaken. There is a real\nneed, as others in the field have already suggested\n(Bauremeister et al., 1989; Daugirdas, 1994;\nChurchill, 1995; Locatelli et al., 1996), for further\nlarge multicentre studies. Such trials should state\nthe patients\u2019 co-morbid illnesses and, perhaps,\nstratify them before trial entry such that the most\neffective membranes for all types of patient can \nbe determined. The trials should be designed to\nevaluate the role of flux, as well as the material\nfrom which the membrane is made, and should\nhave sufficient follow-up for clinical outcomes \nto be measured. In this manner, it could be\ndetermined whether the new membranes which \nare being rapidly developed have improved the\neffectiveness over previously available membranes\nfor patients or sub-groups of patients \non haemodialysis.\nEconomic evaluation\nIntroduction\nThe principles of economic evaluation are\ndescribed in detail in chapter 3 (page 9) including,\nin an economic framework, the manner in which\ncosts and outcome are related (see, in particular,\nTable 2 and Figure 3).\nAims\nIt is possible that synthetic membranes offer\nadditional benefits over cellulose or modified\ncellulose membranes for the dialysis of patients\nwith ESRD. The relative efficiency of these\nalternatives will be investigated using the\nframework of economic evaluation outlined. \nMore specifically, the aims of this economic\nevaluation are:\n(i)  to investigate the relative resources used and\nthe costs of synthetic, cellulose or modified\ncellulose membranes using data extracted\nfrom the identified RCTs and non-randomised\nstudies in which the three type of membranes\nare compared\n(ii)  to combine data on cost differences with \ndata on differential effectiveness from the\nsystematic review of effectiveness described\nabove in order to assess the relative efficiency\nof dialysing patients with synthetic, cellulose,\nor modified cellulose membranes.\nMethods\nData collection\nThe methods used are described in detail in\nchapter 2 of the main report.\nBenefits to patients\nThe systematic review of RCTs or quasi-RCTs\nsynthesised data on the effectiveness of various\nmembranes. The outcome measures were \nas follows.\n1.  Symptomatic hypotension or hypotension\nrequiring intervention, headaches, nausea \nand vomiting, pruritis, anaphylaxis occurring\nduring haemodialysis treatment session\n(recorded as the number of treatment sessions \non which the event occurred).\n2.  Number of haemodialysis treatments associ-\nated with \u2018any adverse symptoms\u2019 if they \nwere not specified with the publication.\n3.  Number of episodes of significant infection\neither per patient or per year (diagnosis of \nand significance of infection as determined \nby each individual study).\n4.  Number of hospital admissions and length \nof stay (as indicator of morbidity and \nresource use).\n5.  Adequacy of dialysis measured either by \nKt\/V or URR.\n6. Pre-dialysis  b2 microglobulin concentration.\n7.  Number of patients with dialysis-associated\namyloidosis.\n8.  Indices of nutritional status: fasting predialysis\ntotal cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDLHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n67\ncholesterol and triglyceride values, predialysis\nalbumen and PCR.\n9.  Quality of life.\n10. Mortality.\nIdentification of resource use and costs\nThe overall cost of haemodialysis using the various\nmembranes was not given in any of the available\ninformation. Differences in resource use (and thus\ncost) between delivery of haemodialysis under\ndifferent policies for use of membranes was\ntherefore assessed in four stages.\n1.  The definition of the process of care, so that all\nrelevant items of resource use could be identified.\n2.  For each part of the process of care (e.g. \nthe dialysis session, the treatment of compli-\ncations) in which resource use was believed \nto be different, data on resource use were\nabstracted from the publications of trials in \nthe effectiveness review.\n3.  Similar data were abstracted from non-\nrandomised studies obtained from the\neconomic search.\n4.  The information on resource use (obtained\nfrom stages 2 and 3) was then combined with\ninformation on the unit cost of the resources \nto determine the cost differential between \nthe various membranes using methodology\ndescribed below. This differential could then be\ncompared with the difference in effectiveness.\nModel of costs\nDialysis session  The information from the 22 RCTs\nincluded in the effectiveness review showed that the\nsame equipment and dialysate could be used for\nboth types of membranes and the sessions, where\nstated, were similar in duration (see following refer-\nences in the list of studies included (page 71):\nAakhus et al., 1995; Bergamo Collaboration, 1991;\nDanielson et al., 1986; Grooteman et al., 1995;\nHosokawa & Yoshida, 1991; Mrowka & Schiffl, 1993;\nSkroeder et al., 1993; 1994). Therefore any differ-\nence in the cost of the dialysis is due solely to the\ndifferent cost of the membrane used.\nTreatment of complications  The relative cost \nof treating complications with the different mem-\nbranes was also estimated using decision analysis\n(Figure 9) (Lapin, 1991). It is assumed in this analysis\nthat when a particular complication occurs\ntreatment is always provided. Data on the propor-\ntion of patients that had a specific complication\nsuch as pruritus or amyloidosis were abstracted\nfrom the identified RCTs, which provided the most\nrobust estimates available. These were used to esti-\nmate the probability that a patient would receive\ntreatment for a complication in a set period (either\nper session, per week or per month). The RCTs and\nthe non-randomised studies were used to identify\nmore precisely the resources used in treatment of \na specific complication. The treatments were then\ncosted according to the staff, consumables, over-\nheads and capital that the treatment consumed.\nThe estimates of staff time were taken from a study\nconducted in the USA (Jones, 1992) in which a\npanel of clinicians and nurses were sampled and\nasked for estimates of staff time for selected clinical\nvignettes of complications of haemodialysis (which\nincluded some of the complications in which we are\ninterested). This paper provided upper and lower\nestimates of staff time and so allowed upper and\nlower estimates to be calculated for the costs of\ncomplications. No such data were available from \na UK source. The prices of any pharmaceuticals\nconsumed were taken from the BNF (1996), and\nthe cost of staff time was estimated by combining\ninformation on time with that from the relevant UK\nNHS salary scales (NHS, 1996a; b). An important\nassumption of this type of model is that the prob-\nability of having a complication (and therefore,\nreceiving treatment) is independent of the prob-\nability of having any other type of complication.\nResults\nBenefits to patients\nThe systematic review of effectiveness compared:\n(i) synthetic membranes as the experimental\ntreatment and cellulose membranes as \nthe control\n(ii) synthetic membranes as the experimental\ntreatment and modified cellulose membranes\nas the control.\nFor these two comparisons no significant differ-\nences were found for dialysis treatments associated\nwith hypotension or with headache, anaphylaxis,\nany adverse symptoms, hospital admissions, signifi-\ncant infection, mortality, PCR or Kt\/V. There were\nalso no significant differences in fasting pre-dialysis\nserum total cholesterol concentration, LDL chol-\nesterol concentration or HDL cholesterol concen-\ntration (see general references to this appendix).\nFasting pre-dialysis serum triglyceride concen-\ntration was significantly lower in patients dialysed\nwith synthetic membranes compared with cellulose\nmembranes, and nausea and vomiting were also\nless. The results of the one available trial showed \nno significant differences between the incidence \nof nausea and vomiting in patients treated with\nsynthetic and modified cellulose membranes. \nA significant difference was reported favouringAppendix 4\n68\nsynthetic over modified cellulose membranes \nin respect of patients\u2019 assessments of the number \nof treatments associated with pruritus. No such\ndifference was found when episodes of pruritus\nwere reported by staff who would initiate treatment.\nThere was a significant reduction in pre-dialysis \nb2 microglobulin serum concentration when\nsynthetic membranes were used compared with\ncellulose membranes. The trials that showed a sig-\nnificant difference between synthetic and cellulose\nmembranes were comparing high-flux synthetic\nmembranes with low-flux cellulose membranes. In\nthe two papers reporting no significant difference,\nboth used membranes of similar low flux. For the\ncomparison of synthetic with modified cellulose\nmembranes, no significant difference was reported.\nThe development of amyloidosis was significantly\nless common in those managed with synthetic\nmembranes compared with those managed with\ncellulose membranes.\nResource use and costs\nEstimates of the costs of membranes were obtained\nfrom the manufacturers (primarily from Gambro\nLtd) and from information obtained from\nAberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust. A range of\ncosts (low, medium and high) is shown in Table 14\nwith upper estimates based upon companies\u2019 price\nlists and lower costs based upon estimates of the\nprices paid by hospital providers.\nCost estimates for complications were obtained \nby combining the staff time estimates with the\nSynthetic\nCellulose\nModified\ncellulose\nNo \nTGC\nTGC\nMembrane\nAmyloidosis\nNo amyloidosis\nPruritus\nNo pruritus\nPruritus\nNo pruritus\nAmyloidosis\nNo amyloidosis\nPruritus\nNo pruritus\nPruritus\nNo pruritus\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nFIGURE 9  Decision model to compare the alternative forms of haemodialysis (n,decision node; l,chance node; ,terminal node;\nTGC = triglyceride concentration)\ns\nsHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n69\nrelevant pay scales and the cost of any consum-\nables (Table 15). The cost of treating pruritus has\nnot been calculated as there was no significant\ndifference in the recording of pruritus per dialysis\nsession by healthcare providers, although patients\nassessed that there were more episodes with\ncellulose than synthetic membranes. It has been\nassumed that treatment would only be provided \nif the healthcare provider knew of the problem.\nAmyloidosis is a long-term condition that may\nrequire surgical interventions (possibly many \nyears later) to relieve some of its symptoms. \nThe cost of such interventions and the time \ndelay before they occurred were not determined \nas no data were identified on which to base\nestimates. Information would be required on \nthe form of intervention, the time delay before \nthe intervention is given and the proportion \nof patients that would require treatment. Also\nrequired would be data on the outcome of \nany intervention.\nThe probabilities for the occurrence of compli-\ncations described in the systematic review of\neffectiveness are shown in Table 16. The higher \nthe probability, the greater the chance of that\ncomplication occurring. There was insufficient\nevidence of any differences in the rate of com-\nplications when synthetic membranes were\ncompared with modified cellulose membranes.\nUsing the data contained in Tables 15 and 16 the\ncost of complications can be calculated using the\nframework shown in Figure 9. This information \ncan then be combined with that on the cost of\nmembranes (see Table 14). The results of this are\nshown in Table 17 for cellulose compared with\nsynthetic membranes. When modified cellulose\nand synthetic membranes were compared, no\ndifferences were found between complications \nthat would require treatment. The only cost differ-\nences remaining are those between the costs of \nthe membranes themselves.\nCombining costs and benefits\nThe combination of the information on the \nrelative effectiveness and cost of haemodialysis\nusing synthetic versus modified cellulose or cellu-\nlose membranes can provide information on the\nrelative efficiency of the two alternatives. Overall,\nthere is greater cost and insufficient evidence of\neffectiveness (area C4 on matrix in Figure 3), and\nthus there is insufficient evidence to recommend\nmanaging patients with haemodialysis using syn-\nthetic membranes in preference to cellulose or\nsubstituted cellulose membranes. Such information\nthat is available tends to suggest that haemodialysis\nusing synthetic membranes provides more benefits\nto patients than haemodialysis using modified\ncellulose or cellulose membranes. If this is assumed\nto be the case, it would be achieved at greater cost\nTABLE 14  The cost of haemodialysis membranes\nCost Type of membrane\nSynthetic Modified  Cellulose \n(\u00a3 per  cellulose  (\u00a3 per \nmembrane) (\u00a3 per  membrane)\nmembrane)\nLow 10 7.5 7.5\nMedium 20\nHigh 29 12 10.5\nTABLE 15  Staff costs of complications per session\nComplication       Staff  Consumable Cost per \ntime          cost  session \n(hours) (\u00a3) (\u00a3)\nLow High Low  High \nVomiting 0.25 0.75 0.50 3.47 8.86 \nTABLE 16  The probabilities of complications occurring when\nthere was a significant difference in outcome between synthetic\nand cellulose membranes (per treatment)\nCondition Cellulose Synthetic\nAmyloidosis 0.7 0\nNausea and vomiting 0.075 0.047\nTABLE 17  The cost per dialysis session of cellulose membranes\ncompared to synthetic membranes\nType of membrane\nCellulose Synthetic \n(\u00a3 per dialysis  (\u00a3 per dialysis \nsession) session)\nLow Price  Low  Medium  Price \ncost list cost cost list\nCost of \nmembrane 7.5 10.5 10 20 29\nCost of \ncomplications 0.55 0.55  0.34 0.34 0.34\nTotal cost 8.05 11.05 10.34 20.34 29.34Appendix 4\n70\n(area C1 on matrix, Figure 3) and a judgement\nwould be required as to whether the synthetic\nmembranes are worth the extra cost.\nAdditional information can be obtained from the\ndata by using incremental analysis, to identify the\nextra resources required to achieve one additional\nunit of a beneficial effect. An estimate of the extra\ncost required to prevent an extra case of nausea\nand vomiting can be calculated to be between \n\u00a390 and \u00a3680 avoided. These figures do not\naccount for other benefits beyond the prevention\nof nausea and vomiting shown for synthetic\nmembranes. Using the data in Table 14 and\nassuming three dialysis sessions per week it can \nbe calculated that the total additional annual \ncost per patient of using synthetic membranes \nlies between \u00a3390 [(\u00a310 \u2013 \u00a37.50) \u00b4 3 \u00b4 52] and\n\u00a33354 [(\u00a329 \u2013 \u00a37.50) \u00b4 3 \u00b4 52] (with the higher\nvalue based upon manufacturers\u2019 price lists for\nsynthetic membranes). These calculations exclude\nthe costs of complications.\nFor the comparison of synthetic membranes \nwith modified cellulose membranes only one\noutcome was significantly different \u2013 the reduction\nof patient-reported episodes of pruritus. Using\nincremental analysis it is possible to estimate that \nit would cost between \u00a337.5 and \u00a3255 per case of\npruritus averted when synthetic are used in prefer-\nence to modified cellulose membranes.\nDiscussion\nThe limitations of the evidence on effectiveness\ndiscussed in the preceding section must be borne\nin mind when interpreting this review. We have\nchosen to concentrate on differences that have\nreached statistical significance and it should be\nremembered that lack of statistical significance\ndoes not necessarily equate with no difference.\nCertainly, most confidence intervals for the\nestimated effects do not rule out clinically\nimportant differences.\nThe data used to estimate the relative efficiency of\nthe alternative membranes also have to be treated\nwith some caution. Costs are derived from estimates\nof resource use which are taken from different\nstudies and which may not be generalisable to\nothers. A further issue is that for this review not all\npotential complications were included in the calcu-\nlation of costs. The cost of treating amyloidosis\nremains uncertain and further work is required \nto identify whether synthetic membranes offer\nsome protection against the development of this\ncondition compared with cellulose and modified\ncellulose membranes. If such differences do exist\nthen the costs and benefits of such treatment \nneed evaluation. \nThere is insufficient data available on effectiveness\nfor a judgement to be made on the relative effi-\nciency of the different membranes. If such data\nthat we have are accepted then the implication\nwould be that synthetic membranes are both more\neffective for certain outcomes and more costly \nthan either cellulose or modified cellulose\nmembranes. A judgement would be required as \nto whether the additional benefits are worth the\nadditional costs, since the additional resources \ncan only be obtained by reducing potentially\nbeneficial services elsewhere.\nOne problem when making this judgement is that it\nis not possible to amalgamate the many measures of\neffectiveness into a single unitary value. Therefore,\nratios of incremental cost to incremental effective-\nness fail to formally take into account the many\ndifferent aspects of benefits that are provided.\nConclusions\nThe conclusions are drawn from both the\nsystematic review of effectiveness and the \neconomic evaluation.\nImplications for clinical practice\n1. End-of-study  b2 microglobulin values and the\ndevelopment of amyloid disease were less in\npatients treated with synthetic membranes\ncompared with cellulose membranes. Plasma\ntriglyceride values were also lower with syn-\nthetic membranes in the single study that\nmeasured this outcome. These outcomes may\nhave reflected the high flux of the membrane.\nNausea and vomiting were less with synthetic\nmembranes (both low and high flux) and\nserum albumin concentrations were higher.\nPruritus was recorded less frequently with syn-\nthetic than with modified cellulose membranes.\n2.  We are hesitant to recommend the universal\nuse of synthetic membranes for haemodialysis\nin patients with ESRD on the basis of the above\nresults because of the small numbers of trials,\nparticularly for modified cellulose membranes\n(many with low patient numbers); the hetero-\ngeneity of many of the trials compared; the\nvariations in membrane flux, and the differ-\nences in exclusion criteria, particularly relating\nto co-morbidity. In this review we found insuffi-\ncient information to perform a satisfactory eco-\nnomic evaluation. Such evidence as there is\nfavours synthetic membranes but the extraHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n71\nbenefit would currently be at considerable\ncost, particularly if high-flux membranes \nwere to be used.\nImplications for research\nFurther pragmatic RCTs are required to compare\nthe different dialysis membranes available. They \nare required:\n(i) to take into account other properties,\nincluding flux, as well as the material from\nwhich the membrane is manufactured, and \nto test modified cellulose membranes as \nwell as standard ones\n(ii) to record the minimum of data, concentrating\non primary outcomes of major importance \nto patients and on patient preference\n(iii) to explicitly record whether symptoms of\npatient- or staff-reported, while recognising\nthat, in general, patient reporting will be \nmore appropriate for evaluating effectiveness\nbut staff reporting may be necessary for\ncalculating the cost of treating complications\n(iv) to be multicentre (and possibly multi-\nnational)in order to have sufficient patients \nfor the trial to be completed despite consider-\nable numbers of withdrawals and drop-outs\n(v) to have sufficiently long follow-up for\nconclusions to be drawn on important \nclinical outcome measures; they should\ncontinue to follow patients who withdraw\nbecause they receive a transplant\n(vi) to include older patients and those with \nco-morbid illnesses and to take these into\naccount when assessing outcomes (possibly \nby stratification at trial entry)\n(vii)to have performed, in parallel, an economic\nevaluation of the different policies being\ncompared in the trial.\nReferences\nStudies included in the review\nAakhus S, Bjoernstad K, Jorstad S, 1995.

Nephrol Dial\nTransplant;12:965\u201372.Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n75\nBackground\nPatients with end-stage renal failure require either\ndialysis (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or \na renal transplant to maintain life. Haemodialysis\nachieves its purpose of replacing renal function \nby passing the patient\u2019s blood through a dialyser\ncontaining a semi-permeable membrane. Dialysate\nis passed through the dialyser on the opposite side\nof the membrane. This membrane allows certain\nsubstances to pass through it by the process of\ndiffusion. Substances normally excreted by the\nkidney, such as urea and potassium, which are in\nrelatively high concentrations in the blood, will\ndiffuse into the dialysate and be removed from \nthe body.\nOne of the critical functions of dialysis is the\ncorrection of the metabolic acidosis caused by the\ndiseased kidney\u2019s failure to excrete non-volatile\nacids and to regenerate bicarbonate. A buffer is\ntherefore added to the dialysate to correct the\nmetabolic acidosis. This buffer passes across the\nsemi-permeable membrane from the dialysate \ninto the blood. Bicarbonate is the natural buffer\nnormally regenerated by the kidneys and was the\ninitial choice as dialysate buffer in the 1940s and\n1950s. However, if sodium bicarbonate is added to \na calcium- or magnesium-containing dialysate, their\nrespective carbonate salts will precipitate unless the\ndialysate is maintained at a low pH level. Dialysate\nconcentrate containing calcium or magnesium was\ntherefore stored separately from bicarbonate-\ncontaining dialysate concentrate. When both were\nmixed with water to produce the final dialysate,\ncarbon dioxide was bubbled through the dialysate\nto lower its pH level and thus avoid precipitation \nof the salts. These procedures demanded extra\nstorage, equiment and labour.\nIn 1964, Mion used acetate as an alternative buffer\n(Mion, et al., 1964). Acetate is rapidly converted to\nbicarbonate in the liver through the action of the\nenzyme acetyl CoA synthetase. From a practical\npoint of view, acetate offered the major advantage\nof not precipitating calcium or magnesium in the\ndialysate; it quickly replaced bicarbonate as the\nstandard dialysate buffer and remained so for \nthe next 20 years.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a number of\nstudies suggested that some of the morbidity asso-\nciated with haemodialysis could be attributed to the\nacetate component of the dialysate (Novello, 1976;\nAizawa, 1977). This morbidity particularly referred\nto intra- and post-haemodialysis symptoms such \nas nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, headaches,\nsymptomatic hypotension, poor appetite and\ncardiovascular instability. Patients on haemodialysis\nhave a markedly increased prevalence of athero-\nmatous vascular disease and it was suggested that\nacetate may contribute to this by its adverse effect\non lipid metabolism (Tolchin, 1979). Renal bone\ndisease may be a source of significant morbidity \nfor dialysis patients and, by its poorer correction \nof metabolic acidosis, acetate dialysate may\ncontribute to its progression.\nThe dialysis-associated symptoms which had \nbeen attributed to \u2018acetate intolerance\u2019 appear \nto have been unmasked by the introduction of\nhigh-efficiency and short-duration dialysis using\nmembranes with large surface areas. This\nmovement towards high-efficiency dialysis \nwas particularly marked in the USA.\nAcetate intolerance led to the reappraisal of\nbicarbonate as a dialysis buffer in the early 1980s\nand, following the solving of technical difficulties,\nto its reintroduction. Initially it was reintroduced\nspecifically for patients thought to be more prone\nto the adverse effects of acetate, such as those who\nhad previously demonstrated acetate intolerance,\nthose with acute renal failure and those with \nknown cardiovascular instability. It was also used \nfor patients with possibly impaired acetate meta-\nbolism, such as those with reduced muscle mass,\ndiabetes mellitus and liver disease. In addition,\nAppendix 5\nSystematic review 2:Comparison of \nbicarbonate-buffered with acetate-buffered \ndialysate in haemodialysis as treatment for \npatients with ESRDAppendix 5\n76\nbicarbonate dialysate was used for those\nundergoing high-efficiency dialysis in which \nlarge surface area membranes may allow a greater\nmass transfer of acetate than the liver is readily \nable to metabolise.\nFrom these early specific indications, bicarbonate\ndialysate rapidly became generally used for all\nhaemodialysis patients in many countries.\nThe use of bicarbonate dialysis in preference to\nacetate dialysis initially had significant cost impli-\ncations. However, today, because nearly all haemo-\ndialysis machines can use either acetate or bicar-\nbonate dialysate with no modification, and because\nof the increased use of bicarbonate, the cost differ-\nential between acetate and bicarbonate dialysis \nmay no longer apply.\nThe purpose of this review was to identify whether\nbicarbonate dialysis is to be preferred to acetate\ndialysis for the haemodialysis of patients with ESRD.\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this review were to compare\nbicarbonate dialysis with acetate dialysis for the\nhaemodialysis of patients with ESRD by testing \nthe following hypotheses:\n(i) that bicarbonate haemodialysis reduces the\nfrequency of adverse symptoms during dialysis\ncompared with acetate dialysis\n(ii) that bicarbonate haemodialysis improves\ncardiovascular stability during dialysis\ncompared with acetate haemodialysis\n(iii) that bicarbonate haemodialysis improves lipid\nprofile compared with acetate haemodialysis\n(iv) that bicarbonate haemodialysis slows the\nprogression of renal bone disease compared\nwith acetate haemodialysis.\nThe cost implications of using bicarbonate\nhaemodialysis instead of acetate haemodialysis \nwere also examined.\nMaterials and methods\nCriteria for considering studies for \nthis review\nTypes of studies  An attempt was made to identify\nall trials in which bicarbonate (experimental\ngroup) was compared with acetate (control \ngroup) in the haemodialysis of patients with ESRD\nand in which patients were prospectively randomly\n(e.g. sealed envelopes with third party involvement)\nor quasi-randomly (alternate patients or alternate\ntreatments) allocated to either treatment. Cross-\nover trials in which treatments alternated to at least\nthe degree A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B were also included, even if the\nallocation to first treatment was neither random\nnor quasi-random.\nTypes of participants  Patients with ESRD who \nwere maintained on haemodialysis were eligible,\nirrespective of age, sex, race, primary renal disease\nor co-morbidity. Trials which exclusively comprised\npatients with acute renal failure were excluded.\nEach individual study\u2019s definition of ESRD or\nmaintenance haemodialysis was accepted.\nTypes of intervention  In the experimental \ngroup haemodialysis was against a predominantly\nbicarbonate-buffered dialysate, while in the control\ngroup it was against a predominantly acetate-\nbuffered dialysate. Only haemodialysis was\nconsidered and any form of haemofiltration \nwas excluded.\nTypes of outcome measures\n1. Intra- and postdialytic symptoms: frequency \nof nausea, vomiting, headaches, muscle \ncramps, symptomatic or treatment-requiring\nhypotension; any assessment of patient\nacceptability, well-being or quality of life.\n2. Intradialytic cardiovascular stability: changes \nin blood pressure, cardiac output and \nperipheral vascular resistance.\n3. Correction of metabolic acidosis: pre-, \nintra- and postdialysis pH level, PCO2 and\nbicarbonate concentrations.\n4. Indicators of renal bone disease: serum\ncalcium, phosphate and parathyroid \nhormone concentrations.\n5. Lipid profile: fasting cholesterol \nand trigylcerides.\nSearch strategy for identification \nof studies\nThe search strategy used was one developed for \nthe identification of all possible RCTs or quasi-\nRCTs relating to the management of ESRD, and is\ndescribed in detail in chapter 2 and appendices 2\nand 3.\nMethods of the review\nIdentified studies were evaluated using a study\nevaluation form and those which met the eligibility\ncriteria (included references) were then consider-\ned in detail. Data were extracted using a data\nabstraction form designed for this review (see\nappendix 10). Review Manager v. 3.0 was used Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n77\nfor the analysis. A full description of the methods\nused is given in chapter 2.\nDescription of studies\nA total of 18 studies were identified which met the\neligibility criteria of being RCTs or quasi-RCTs. The\nAntwerp trial in 1983 was subsequently considered\nas two separate trials (de Backer, et al., 1983); in\naddition to being randomised to bicarbonate or\nacetate dialysis, patients had also been randomised\nto dialysis with a polyacrylonitryl or a cuprophane\nmembrane. Similarly, the Hamilton trial in 1983\nwas subsequently considered to be two separate\nstudies (Shimizu, et al., 1983) as patients had also\nbeen randomised to high sodium or low sodium\ndialysate. The descriptions of method of allocation\npublished were accepted and no confirmation was\nsought from the authors. In cases where the same\nstudy had been published more than once, only \nthe most recent data were used. If more than one\nrelevant study was published in the same paper,\neach study was listed and analysed separately. All\nthe studies included were published in full except\nfor the Philadelphia study in 1985 (Brezin, et al.,\n1985), which was only available as an abstract. \nOnly published data from the studies were used.\nSeven of the studies could not be included in \nthe quantitative analyses because the recorded\nmeasures outcome differed from those specified.\nThis indicates the wide variation in recorded\nmeasures of outcome for essentially similar\noutcomes demonstrated across the studies. \nThe studies are summarised in Table 18.\nA total of 30 crossover studies which were not\nrandomised or quasi-randomised or did not\ndemonstrate alternation at least to the degree\nA\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B are listed as excluded studies. No \nfurther analyses of these studies were made.\nMethodological quality of \nincluded studies\nAll 18 included studies were of crossover design,\nalthough in the 1983 Paris study (Lefebvre, et al.,\n1983b) only half of the patients entered the\ncrossover phase.\nPotential for selection bias at trial entry\nIn 16 studies it was claimed that the order of\ntreatment had been randomly allocated but in \n14 of these the method of random allocation was\nnot described. Only in the Cambridge study in \n1988 (Bradley, et al., 1988) was a secure method \nof random allocation concealment prior to final\ntrial entry described (third-party involvement). \nIn the 1979 Columbia study (van Stone & Cook,\n1978; 1979) a potentially insecure method of\nrandom allocation concealment was described\n(coin toss with no stated third-party involvement).\nTwo studies were included on the basis of quasi-\nrandomisation solely because their treatments or\ntreatment periods alternated A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B (Brezin, \net al., 1985: Savidie, et al., 1977). The order of\ntreatments was not randomly allocated. Neither \nof these studies had data which could be included\nin any of the meta-analyses; hence, sensitivity\nanalyses to determine the influence of these less\nmethodologically robust studies on the summary\nstatistics could not be undertaken.\nPotential for bias in trial analysis\nIn four of the 18 studies the numbers and reasons\nfor withdrawals and drop-outs were described. One\nstudy mentioned that there had been withdrawals\nbut did not give details. A further six studies report-\ned no withdrawals or drop-outs, and seven studies\nmade no mention of withdrawals or drop-outs.\nNone of the studies from which data were included\nfor meta-analysis had been explicitly undertaken on\nan intention-to-treat basis.\nPotential for bias at time of treatment or\noutcome assessment\nIn four studies, patients, healthcare providers \nand outcomes assessors were explicitly stated to \nhave been blinded. Three studies described an\neffective method of blinding; the fourth gave \nno description.\nIn six studies, no mention was made of blinding.\nThe remaining eight studies, although not always\ndescribing the method, mentioned blinding of at\nleast one of three groups: patients, healthcare\nproviders, outcomes assessors. In some studies,\nhealthcare providers and outcomes assessors \nmay have been the same people, and hence \nour categorisation may have underestimated \nthe degree of blinding.\nThe quality assessment tool used in this study\nassumes that the avoidance of bias is best achieved\nby an RCT with:\n\u2022 secure concealment of allocation before formal\ntrial entry\n\u2022 adequate blinding of patients, outcomes\nassessors and healthcare providers\n\u2022 descriptions of reasons and numbers of\nwithdrawals and drop-outs\n\u2022 analysis on an intention-to-treat basis.\nNone of the trials fulfilled all these criteria.Appendix 5\n78\nTABLE 18  Characteristics of included studies:bicarbonate- versus acetate-buffered dialysate in haemodialysis of patients with ESRD\nStudy Method Participants Interventions Outcomes Notes\nAntwerp 1983a  RCT,crossover design;

The incidence of headaches on\nbicarbonate dialysis was lower in four of the five\ntrials with an overall estimate favouring bicarbonate\ndialysis (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71, 0.99; NNT, 33).\nAlthough there was evidence of heterogeneity\nacross the trials (chi-squared test, 2p < 0.05), \nover 90% of the data came from the 1983 \nHamilton trial and the summary OR is largely\ndetermined by this trial.\nThe 1985 Philadelphia trial reported the incidence\nof headaches (Brezin, et al., 1985) but in relation \nto episodes over a period and, hence, could not be\nincluded in this meta-analysis. There was a non-\nsignificant tendency favouring bicarbonate dialysate.\nNausea and vomiting\nIn five studies the number of haemodialysis treat-\nments were compared for which nausea and\/or\nvomiting were reported. The estimate of the overall\neffect favoured the use of bicarbonate (OR, 0.42;\n95% CI, 0.26, 0.66; NNT, 49). The results of the\ntrials were significantly heterogeneous (chi squared\ntest, 2p < 0.01). The incidence rates of nausea and\nvomiting in the acetate groups were higher in the\nthree smaller studies, in which there were fewer\nepisodes during bicarbonate dialysis, than in the\n1983 Hamilton trial (Shimizu, et al., 1983a; b) in\nwhich there was no difference between the groups.\nIn the 1985 Philadelphia trial (Brezin, et al., 1985),\nwhich was not included in the meta-analysis (see\nabove), there were fewer episodes of vomiting in\nthe bicarbonate group (6 versus 30; p < 0.005).\nMuscle cramps\nData describing muscle cramps were available for\nonly the two parts of the Hamilton trial (Shimizu, \net al., 1983a; b) and the smaller Chicago trial\n(Dalal, et al., 1990b; c). The comparison is there-\nfore dominated by the data from the Hamilton\ntrial, which suggested there was no difference.\nThe 1991 Madras trial (Gurudev, et al., 1991) was\nnot included in the meta-analysis because no\nmuscle cramps were reported with either dialysate\n(0\/90 treatments with bicarbonate; 0\/90\ntreatments with acetate); hence, no OR could be\ncalculated.\nSymptomatic or treatment-requiring\nhypotension\nTwo studies with a total of 396 haemodialysis\ntreatments were included in the meta-analysis. \nThe suggestion of a significant reduction in\nsymptomatic hypotension with bicarbonate\ndialysate (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11, 0.69; NNT, 17)\nreflects the findings of the 1979 Chicago trial\n(Dalal, et al., 1979b; c).\nTABLE 18 contd  Characteristics of included studies:bicarbonate- versus acetate-buffered dialysate in haemodialysis of patients with ESRD\nStudy Method Participants Interventions Outcomes Notes\nTorrance 1981 RCT,crossover design, Seven routine  Acetate vs.bicarbonate  Intra- and postdialytic symp- \nmethod of random  haemodialysis patients; dialysis;duration of study, toms not stated;intradialytic \n(Dolan,et al., allocation not described; M:F,3:4;mean age  one treatment with each  cardiovascular stability not \n1981;Davidson, patients blinded but  44.7 years,range  dialysate,duration of dialysis, stated;arterial blood gases and \net al.,1982) method not given; 22\u201355 years;mean  4 hours;blood flow rate  acid\u2013base balance:PO2,P CO2;\nblinding of healthcare  weight 61.2 kg,range  200 \u00b1 20 ml\/min;dialysate  renal bone disease indicators\nproviders and outcomes  41.0\u201392.8 kg;co-  flow rate 500 \u00b1 50 ml\/min; and lipid profile not stated;\nassessors not stated; morbidity:free of  membrane type,Travenol  other parameters:VO2 (oxygen \nwithdrawals,drop-outs  cardiovascular and  CF 1500,surface area  uptake),VCO2 (CO2 excretion),\nand number lost to  pulmonary disease  1.5 m\n2;dialysate sodium  VCO2\/VO2 (respiratory gas \nfollow-up not stated; apart from mild  concentration;acetate  exchange ratio).\nanalysis possibly on  controlled hyper-  130 mmol\/l,bicarbonate \nintention-to-treat basis  tension;two patients  130 mmol\/l;dialysate buffer \nbut not clear. with diabetes mellitus  concentration:acetate \nas cause of renal dialysate \u2013 acetate 35 mmol\/l,\nfailure. bicarbonate nil;bicarbonate \ndialysate \u2013 acetate nil,\nbicarbonate 35 mmol\/l.Data from a number of the included studies could\nnot be included in this meta-analysis.

Again there was\nmarked heterogeneity between the results of the\nHamilton trial (Shimizu, et al., 1983a; b), which\nsuggested a modest 10% reduction in the OR, \nand the two smaller trials, which suggested about\nan 85% reduction in the OR.\nAny adverse symptoms\nIn five studies (3192 haemodialysis treatments) \nany adverse symptoms were recorded. The overall\nestimate favoured bicarbonate (OR, 0.71; 95% \nCI, 0.61, 0.82; chi-squared test for heterogeneity, \np < 0.001). The pattern was similar to that for non-\nspecific intolerance: all suggested fewer symptoms\nassociated with bicarbonate, but the estimate of\neffect was much more modest in the larger\nHamilton trial (Shimizu, et al., 1983a; b).\nGeneral well-being and \npatient acceptability\nOnly two studies reported on general well-being\nand\/or patient acceptability. However, different\nmeasurement tools were used in these trials, hence\nthe results could not be combined.\nIn the 1982 Seattle trial (Pagel, et al., 1982), the\n\u2018choice reaction time\u2019 immediately postdialysis was\nused as an indicator of well-being. A significant\ndifference favouring bicarbonate was noted\n(bicarbonate, 9.1 ms, standard error of the mean\n(SEM), 37.1; acetate, 29.3 ms, SEM, 38.1; p < 0.05).\nA \u2018state of well-being index\u2019 was used in the 1979\nColumbia trial (van Stone & Cook, 1979a; b) in\nwhich patients described how they felt both pre-\nand postdialysis. Although there was no significant\ndifference predialysis, patients using bicarbonate\nfelt significantly better postdialysis that patients\nusing acetate.\nMeta-analyses of the included studies indicated a\nsignificant reduction in all adverse symptoms, both\ncollectively and individually (apart from muscle\ncramps) with bicarbonate dialysis.\nAny data from the included studies which were\nrelevant to these outcomes but not possible to\ninclude in the meta-analysis either supported the\nuse of bicarbonate or failed to find a significant\ndifference between the dialysates.\nCardiovascular stability\nThe frequency of symptomatic or treatment-\nrequiring hypotension was the only indicator \nof cardiovascular stability subjected to meta-\nanalysis. The results are recorded above under\nintradialytic symptoms.\nIn other studies, parameters were recorded which\nwere relevant to cardiovascular stability but which\nwere not encompassed by our comparisons. In the\nColumbia trial (van Stone & Cook, 1979a; b), no\nsignificant differences in the means of predialysis,\npostdialysis and lowest intradialytic supine and\nupright systolic and diastolic blood pressures were\nfound between the dialysates. In the Seattle trial\n(Pagel, et al., 1982), the change in mean arterial\nintradialytic pressure was reported as significantly\nless and the lowest intradialytic systolic, diastolic\nand mean arterial blood pressures were reported as\nsignificantly greater with bicarbonate dialysis. A\nsignificantly decreased rate of fall in mean arterial\npressure but no difference in change of venous\ntone during bicarbonate dialysis was reported in\nthe Cambridge trial (Bradley, et al., 1988).\nAlthough a significant increase in heart rate with\nacetate as opposed to bicarbonate dialysis was\nreported in the Paris trial (Lefebvre, et al., 1983b),\nthere was no significant difference in the fall of\nsystolic blood pressure with bicarbonate compared\nwith acetate dialysis. A significant increase in heart\nrate was reported with acetate but not with bicar-\nbonate dialysis in the Boston trial; however, Schick\nand colleagues (1983) found no significant differ-\nence between the two dialysates in changes in\nsystolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure,\nejection fraction and cardiac output. Only one of\nthe two studies included in the meta-analysis\nindicated a reduction in symptomatic hypotension\nwith bicarbonate dialysis. In the studies which\nassessed cardiovascular stability with parameters\nother than those used in this comparison, no\nsignificant differences were usually found between\nthe dialysates. If any significant difference was\nfound, it always favoured bicarbonate dialysis.\nTherefore, no conclusive evidence was found \nthat bicarbonate dialysis improves cardiovascular\nstability in the haemodialysis of patients with ESRD.\nCorrection of metabolic acidosis\nPostdialysis arterial (from arteriovenous fistula) \npH and bicarbonate levels indicate how well \na particular dialysate buffer has corrected the\nmetabolic acidosis over the course of treatment.\nPredialysis pH and bicarbonate levels reflect \nthe chronic acid\u2013base status of the patient, \nwhich is likely to have greater long-term\npathophysiological significance.\nPredialysis pH level (after at least one dialysis \non specific dialysate)\nTwo studies were included in the meta-analysis.\nThere was no significant difference between the\ndialysates (WMD, 0.01; 95% CI, \u20130.01, 0.03).Appendix 5\n90\nPredialysis bicarbonate level (after at least one\ndialysis on specific dialysate)\nThree studies were included in the meta-analysis. \nA significant difference was found which favoured\nbicarbonate (WMD, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.31, 2.49).\nPostdialysis pH level\nOnly one study reported postdialysis pH levels\n(Gurudev, et al., 1991). There was no difference\nbetween the dialysates.\nPostdialysis bicarbonate level\nTwo studies were included in this meta-analysis.\nBicarbonate dialysate resulted in higher postdialysis\nbicarbonate levels (WMD, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.41, 2.05).\nHowever, a larger difference was observed in one\ntrial than in the other (chi-squared test, p < 0.01).\nSummary\nBicarbonate dialysis was associated with only a\nmarginally higher pre- and postdialysis blood\nbicarbonate level compared with acetate dialysis.\nThere was no difference between the dialysates in\nrelation to arterial pH level.\nArterial blood gases\nSome of the adverse symptoms and cardiovascular\ninstability experienced on haemodialysis have been\nattributed to hypoxia. It has been suggested that\nacetate dialysate may be associated with more\nsevere hypoxia because of loss of respiratory drive\ncaused by hypocarbia (a consequence of greater\nloss of carbon dioxide into the dialysate).\nPostdialysis PO2\nThree studies were included in the meta-analysis.\nEnd-dialysis PO2 was higher with bicarbonate dialysis\nin all three studies (WMD, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.61,\n1.40), although the size of the difference varied\nbetween them (chi-squared test, p < 0.05).\nLowest intradialytic PO2\nNone of the studies reported this outcome.\nPostdialysis PCO2\nOnly the 1991 Madras study (Gurudev, et al., \n1991) reported postdialysis PCO2; it was signifi-\ncantly higher at the end of bicarbonate dialysis\ncompared with acetate dialysis (WMD, 0.16; \n95% CI, 0.04, 0.28).\nNot all data relevant to the stated outcomes from\nthe included trials could be included in the meta-\nanalyses, because of the various time points used \nby the different studies when reporting acid\u2013base\nand blood gas data. These data may be summarised\nas follows.\n\u2022 In the Chicago trial (Dalal, et al., 1989; 1990b), \na significant decrease in PO2 and PCO2 during\nacetate but not bicarbonate dialysis was reported,\ntogether with a significantly faster correction of\npH and bicarbonate levels with bicarbonate dialy-\nsis. However, by 1 hour postdialysis there were no\nsignificant differences in these parameters.\n\u2022 The 1979 Columbia trial (van Stone & Cook,\n1978; 1979) reported significantly higher levels\nof PO2, PCO2, and pH after a 3-hour dialysis with\nbicarbonate compared with acetate.\n\u2022 The data from the 1983 Newcastle trial (Ramos,\net al., 1983) showed a significant fall in PO2 dur-\ning acetate dialysis but not during bicarbonate\ndialysis. The PO2 had returned to predialysis\nvalues by the last hour of dialysis, the pH level\nwas raised more rapidly during bicarbonate\ndialysis, and PCO2 and bicarbonate level were\nsignificantly increased during bicarbonate but\nnot during acetate dialysis.\n\u2022 A significant fall in PO2 during acetate dialysis\n(still present at end of dialysis) but not during\nbicarbonate dialysis was reported in the 1981\nTorrance trial (Dolan, et al., 1981; Davidson, \net al., 1982).\n\u2022 The results of the 1983 Antwerp trial (de Backer,\net al., 1983) demonstrated a significant fall in \nPO2 with both acetate and bicarbonate dialysate\nwhen using cuprophane dialysis membranes \nbut only with acetate dialysate when using\npolyacrylonitryl membranes.\n\u2022 In the 1982 Seattle trial (Pagel, et al., 1982),\nsignificantly higher bicarbonate and pH levels\nafter 1 hour of dialysis, which persisted through-\nout the dialysis treatment, were reported during\nbicarbonate dialysis compared with \nacetate dialysis.\nOverview\nThe meta-analysis and other data from the\nincluded studies indicate that bicarbonate dialysis is\nmore likely to avoid dialysis-associated hypoxia than\nacetate dialysis. However, there was no evidence\nthat this improved either morbidity or mortality.\nFasting lipids\nOnly the 1977 Sydney trial (Savidie, et al., 1977)\nreported on fasting lipids. A mean difference could\nnot be calculated, however, because the relevant\nstandard deviation could not be derived from the\ndata published. No significant difference in fasting\npredialysis lipids between bicarbonate and acetate\ndialysis was noted.\nIndicators of renal bone disease\nThe 1983 Newcastle trial (Ramos, et al., 1983) \nwas the only one in which data relevant to renalHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n91\nbone disease was presented but, because these data\nwere only presented graphically, they could not be\nincluded in a meta-analysis. However, there was no\nsignificant difference between bicarbonate and\nacetate dialysis relative to predialysis calcium,\nphosphate and parathyroid hormone levels.\nDiscussion\nBicarbonate has largely supplanted acetate as the\nmost frequently used dialysate buffer in haemo-\ndialysis\/haemofiltration. In general, bicarbonate-\nbuffered dialysate is used for 78% of patients on\nhaemodialysis\/haemofiltration in the UK and for\n76% of patients in Europe (Vallerrabano, et al.,\n1996). However, some countries such as Bulgaria\nand Romania have lagged behind this general\nswitch to bicarbonate dialysis. The switch from\nacetate to bicarbonate haemodialysis was based \non perceived advantages in reducing intradialytic\nsymptoms (Leenan, et al., 1980; Heneghan, 1982),\nimproved cardiovascular stability (Okusa, et al.,\n1982), better correction of metabolic acidosis,\nsuperior lipid profile and, possibly, a slowing \nof the progression of renal bone disease.\nThis systematic review of the literature has\nattempted to define whether this switch to\nbicarbonate-buffered haemodialysis is supported \nby evidence from good clinical trials, which specific\nputative benefits are so supported and what the\neconomic outcomes of the change have been.\nMeta-analyses of the included studies indicated a\nsignificant reduction in all adverse symptoms apart\nfrom muscle cramps, both collectively and individ-\nually, with bicarbonate dialysis. The NNT (for\nexample, 33 bicarbonate haemodialysis treatments\nwould, on average, need to be undertaken in order\nto produce one extra treatment without headaches)\nshould be considered in the contest of the number\nof treatments each patient requires each year\n(approximately 150). However, there was consider-\nable heterogeneity across the studies, although this\nwas related predominantly to magnitude rather than\ndirection of effect. It is difficult to identify precisely\nthe explanation for this heterogeneity across trials;\nhowever, much is a consequence of the difference \nin size of effect favouring bicarbonate noted\nbetween the 1983 Hamilton studies (Shimizu, et al.,\n1983) and the 1991 Madras (Gurudev, et al., 1991)\nand 1990 Chicago studies (Dalal, et al., 1989; 1990).\nThis may be attributable to differences in the dur-\ntion of the study (number of treatments per patient)\nand in the method of symptom reporting. The 1983\nHamilton study assessed approximately 96 dialysis\ntreatments per patient while the 1991 Madras study\nassessed six treatments per patient and the 1990\nChicago study only two per patient. The method of\nadverse symptom reporting in the 1983 Hamilton\nstudy (and in the 1982 Seattle study (Pagel, et al.,\n1982)) was explicitly by patient questionnaire, while\nthe 1991 Madras and 1990 Chicago studies appear \nto have been recorded by dialysis staff. The report-\ning of symptoms by dialysis staff might under-\nrecord adverse symptoms compared with a \npatient questionnaire.\nThe review has generated evidence in support of the\nuse of bicarbonate-buffered haemodialysis in the\ntreatment of all patients with ESRD. However, the\nevidence only conclusively favours bicarbonate\nhaemodialysis in relation to a reduction in intra-\ndialytic symptoms, particularly headaches, nausea\nand vomiting, and symptomatic hypotension. There\nis no clear evidence that bicarbonate dialysis has \nany effect on the frequency of intradialytic muscle\ncramps, leads to a more favourable lipid profile or\nslows the progression of renal bone disease; how-\never, there are few data available for these outcomes.\nThe evidence of improved cardiovascular stability is\ninconclusive. This may be a consequence of our\ninability to summate various cardiovascular para-\nmeters from the different studies. There is evidence\nof a modest improvement in control of metabolic\nacidosis with bicarbonate, although the clinical and\npathophysiological relevance of this is uncertain.\nEarly studies suggested that the improvement in\noutcomes associated with switching to bicarbonate\nhaemodialysis may be particularly marked in certain\npatient groups, such as those with acute renal\nfailure, cardiovascular instability or known acetate\nintolerance. None of the studies included exclusively\nexamined these patient groups; indeed, in general,\npatient groups were composed of chronic stable\npatients with limited associated co-morbidity. The\nresults of this review may therefore underestimate\nthe beneficial effect of bicarbonate-buffered\nhaemodialysis in respect to these sub-groups.\nIn the UK at least, bicarbonate haemodialysis is no\nlonger significantly more expensive than acetate\nhaemodialysis. This is a dramatic change from the\nsituation some 5\u201310 years ago. The initially greater\ncost of bicarbonate haemodialysis certainly \nslowed its uptake, even by those convinced of the\nclinical benefits. The health economics history of\nbicarbonate haemodialysis may be illustrative of the\nimplementation of high technology advances in\ngeneral. Initial studies suggested that it had at least\na modest superiority over acetate dialysis, which\nseemed to be most marked in relation to relativelyAppendix 5\n92\nsmall patient groups, such as those with cardiac\ndisease or with known acetate intolerance. If\nbicarbonate dialysis had been restricted to these\ngroups, it is likely that its cost would have remained\nsignificantly higher than acetate dialysis. However,\nits general use in the stable dialysis population has\nled to a significant fall in cost.\nWhen undertaking this review, a number of\nmethodological problems were encountered which\nmay be relevant to future reviews in this area. The\nmanagement of ESRD is a low patient volume and\nhigh technology speciality; hence, trials have tended\nto be of small populations. The very high drop-out\nrates from medium or long duration studies, which\nare an inevitable consequence of dialysis technique\nfailure, renal transplantation and high morbidity\nand mortality in this population, may also have\nencouraged trials of short duration. Studies assessing\nimportant, unequivocal primary outcome measures\nsuch as death are rare because they require relatively\nprolonged follow-up. Moreover, primary outcomes\nsuch as death cannot be assessed satisfactorily using\na crossover study design. Secondary outcome\nmeasures are more likely than primary ones to\nchange significantly over the course of a short study.\nThe routine management of dialysis patients pro-\nduces a vast array of secondary outcome measures,\nsuch as blood pressure recordings and biochemical\ndata. These two factors may have influenced, and are\nlikely to continue to influence, the predominance of\nsurrogate endpoints in studies of dialysis treatment.\nEssentially similar surrogate endpoints may be\nrecorded differently by different studies; reported\nbicarbonate may, for example, be pre- or post-\ndialysis, while cardiovascular stability may be assessed\nby many different parameters, from mean arterial\nblood pressure to changes in systolic blood pressure.\nThis variation in recording of similar outcomes\npresented significant difficulties in this review, \nas data from various trials could often not \nbe combined.\nEconomic evaluation\nIntroduction\nThe principles of economic evaluation are\ndescribed in detail in chapter 3 (page 9) \nincluding, in an economic framework, the manner\nin which costs and outcome are related (see, in\nparticular, Table 2 and Figure 3).\nAims\nBicarbonate can be used as a buffer in haemo-\ndialysis and has been suggested as an alternative \nto acetate-buffered haemodialysis in the belief that\npatients dialysed with bicarbonate suffer fewer\ncomplications. The relative efficiency of these two\nalternatives will be investigated using the frame-\nwork of economic evaluation outlined in chapter 3.\nMore specifically, the aims of this economic\nevaluation are:\n(i) to investigate the relative resources used \nand the cost of acetate and bicarbonate\nhaemodialysis fluids using data extracted from\nthe identified RCTs and non-randomised\nstudies which compared acetate and\nbicarbonate buffers in haemodialysis\n(ii) to combine data on differences in costs with\ndata on differential benefits to patients from\nthe systematic review of effectiveness above \nin order to assess the relative efficiency of\nhaemodialysing patients with bicarbonate \nor acetate buffer.\nMethods\nData collection and extraction\nThe methods used are described in detail in\nchapter 3 of the main report.\nBenefits to patients\nThe systematic review of RCTs or quasi-RCTs\ndescribed above had as its main objective the syn-\nthesis of data on the effectiveness of haemodialysis\nwith acetate compared with bicarbonate as a buffer\nfrom the RCTs. Information was extracted from the\nRCTs on the following outcomes:\n(i) the frequency of adverse symptoms \nduring dialysis\n(ii) cardiovascular stability during dialysis\n(iii) the patient\u2019s lipid profile\n(iv) the progression of renal bone disease.\nIdentification of resource use and costs\nThe identification of the relative resources used\nwhen dialysing patients with either bicarbonate \nor acetate haemodialysis involved four steps. \n1. The process of care was defined so that all\nitems of resource use could be identified; for\nexample, resources could potentially be con-\nsumed during three main stages: preparation\nof the dialysate; the dialysis session itself; and\nin the treatment of any complications which\nmay occur.\n2. All the relevant information was extracted\nfrom the RCTs.\n3. The data on resource use contained in the\nnon-randomised studies was assessed.\n4. The information on resource use was then\ncombined with information on the unit cost Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n93\nof the resources to determine the cost differ-\nential between bicarbonate and acetate\nhaemodialysis using methodology described\nbelow. This differential could then be com-\npared with data on differential benefits to\npatients obtained from the systematic \nreview of effectiveness.\nModel of costs\n1.  Dialysate preparation  The bicarbonate\ndialysate can be prepared in three ways. First, \nit can be mixed by hand from a pre-prepared\npowder. Second, the dialysate powder can be\nautomatically mixed by the dialysis machine.\nFinally, the dialysate solution can be obtained\nas a premixed concentrate. Acetate dialysate \nis normally only provided as a pre-mixed\nconcentrate (G Anderson, Gambro: personal\ncommunication, 1996). The resources (and\ncosts) required for each of the three bicar-\nbonate options are different; the additional\ncost of bicarbonate dialysate is, therefore,\ndependent on the method of preparation \nof the dialysate. The prices of the alternative\nforms of preparation of the dialysate were\nobtained from the manufacturers. Staff costs\nwere estimated from the relevant UK NHS\nsalary scales (NHS, 1996a; b) together with\nestimates of time required.\n2. The dialysis session  The information\nextracted from the RCTs indicates that the\nresources required to perform the dialysis \nwere independent of the nature of the buffer\nused. The same equipment was used for both\ndialysates and the sessions were of the same\nlength (de Backer, et al., 1983; Spongono, \net al., 1989; Schick, et al., 1983; Bradley, et al.,\n1988; Dalal, et al., 1989; 1990; van Stone &\nCook, 1979; Shimizu, et al., 1983; Gurudev, \net al., 1991; Ramos, et al., 1983; Otte, et al.,\n1990; Peces Serrano, et al., 1986; Akanji &\nSacks, 1991; Lefebvre, et al., 1983; Brezin, et al.,\n1985; Pagel, et al., 1982; Savidie, et al., 1977;\nDolan, et al., 1981). Therefore, any difference\nin the cost of the dialysis is due solely to the\ndifferent cost of the dialysate used.\n3. Treatment of complications  The cost of\ntreating complications was also calculated. \nIn order to calculate the relative cost of\ncomplications associated with the different\nmethods of delivering bicarbonate compared\nwith acetate haemodialysis, the model depicted\nin Figure 10 was used. In this analysis it has\nbeen assumed that when a particular compli-\ncation occurs then treatment is always pro-\nvided. Data from the identified RCTs, which\nprovided the best quality information avail-\nable, were extracted on the proportion of\npatients who had a specific complication such\nas headache, nausea or muscle cramps. This\nprovided information on the probability that \na patient would receive treatment for a com-\nplication in a set period (either per session,\nper week or per month). The review of the\neconomic aspects of the RCTs and non-\nrandomised studies attempted to identify \nthe precise treatment provided for a \nspecific complication.\nThe treatments were then costed according \nto the staff time, consumables, overheads and\ncapital that the treatment consumed. The\nestimates of staff time come from an American\npaper by Jones and colleagues (1995) which\nasked a panel of clinicians and nurses to esti-\nmate staff time for selected clinical vignettes \nof complications of haemodialysis (including\nsome of the complications of interest here). \nIt provided upper and lower estimates of staff\ntime, thus allowing calculation of upper and\nlower estimates of the cost of complications.\nThe price of any pharmaceuticals consumed\nwas taken from the BNF (BMA, 1996); the cost\nof staff time was estimated by combining infor-\nmation on time with that from the relevant UK\nNHS salary scales (NHS, 1996a; b). An import-\nant assumption in this type of model is that \nthe probability of having a complication (and\ntherefore, receiving treatment) is independent\nof the probability of having any other type \nof complication.\nResults\nBenefits to patients\nThe results of the systematic review of effective-\nness were reported earlier. In brief, the review\nstudied five symptom categories: headaches,\nnausea\/vomiting, muscle cramps, symptomatic \nor treatment-requiring hypotension and non-\nspecific intolerance. The meta-analysis showed \nan overall estimate of the frequency of occurrence\nof headaches favouring bicarbonate haemodialysis\n(OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71, 0.99). For nausea and\nvomiting, the estimate of overall effect favoured \nthe use of bicarbonate haemodialysis (OR, 0.42;\n95% CI, 0.26, 0.66). There was no significant\ndifference for muscle cramps (OR, 0.97; 95% \nCI, 0.77, 1.22). There was a significant reduction \nin symptomatic hypotension with bicarbonate\nhaemodialysis (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11, 0.69). \nFor non-specific intolerance, the overall estimate\nfavoured bicarbonate haemodialysis (OR, 0.79;\n95% CI, 0.67, 0.93).Appendix 5\n94\nTwo RCTs assessed general well-being and patient\nsatisfaction; they found that patients felt significantly\nbetter with bicarbonate dialysis compared with ace-\ntate dialysis. No significant differences were found\nbetween acetate haemodialysis and bicarbonate\nhaemodialysis when cardiovascular stability, correc-\ntion of metabolic acidosis, postdialysis pH and bicar-\nbonate, predialysis pH (after at least one dialysis on\na specific dialysate) and bicarbonate (after at least\none dialysis on a specific dialysate), arterial blood\ngases, postdialysis PO2, fasting lipids and indicators \nof renal bone disease were measured.\nThe meta-analyses and the other data from the\nincluded studies indicate that dialysis-associated\nhypoxia occurs less frequently when bicarbonate is\nused as the dialysis buffer. There was no evidence\nthat this improved either morbidity or mortality.\nResource use and costs\nNone of the studies identified by this review\ninvolved any form of economic or cost analysis \nof bicarbonate haemodialysis compared with\nacetate haemodialysis. The principle cost differ-\nences between the two modes of treatment result\nfrom differences in the method of preparation, the\ncost of the dialysate used and the cost of treatment \nof complications.\nResources used before and during the \ndialysis session\nThe RCTs provided information on the nature of\nthe dialysates available. To find the cost of prepar-\nation of these dialysates, manufacturers were con-\ntacted to provide information on the costs of alter-\nnative preparations. The differences in cost between\nacetate and bicarbonate are shown in Table 20 and\nwere estimated for the following three scenarios:\n(a) each dialysate is in a prepacked solution\n(b) the bicarbonate is mixed from commercially\navailable powder by hand, while the acetate \nis a prepacked solution that is ready for use\n(c) the bicarbonate comes in a container of dry\npowder which the dialysis machine apportions\nand, again, the acetate comes as a \nprepacked solution.\nComplications\nCost estimates for complications were obtained \nby combining the staff time estimates with the\nrelevant salary scales and the cost of any consum-\nAcetate\nDry powder\nSelf mix\nSolution\nBicarbonate\nDialysate\nMuscle cramps\nNo muscle cramps\nHypotension\nNo hypotension\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nHypotension\nNo hypotension\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nVomiting\nNo vomiting\nFIGURE 10  Decision model to compare the alternative forms of haemodialysis (n,decision node; l,chance node; ,terminal node)\ns\nsHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n95\nables (Table 21). The probabilities for the compli-\ncations which are obtained from the systematic\nreview of effectiveness are shown in Table 22. The\nhigher the probability, the more chance there is \nof that complication occurring. It was not possible\nto obtain cost estimates for the treatment of head-\naches or for non-specific intolerance. The\nsignificance of this is discussed below.\nUsing the data contained in Tables 21 and 22, \nthe cost of complications can be calculated. This\ninformation can then be combined with the cost \nof dialysates shown in Table 20. The results are\npresented in Table 23.\nThe costs for each of three methods of preparation\nof bicarbonate buffer and the cost of acetate sup-\nplied in pre-mixed solution are shown in Table 23.\nHigh, medium and low estimates are provided \nfor the methods of preparation of each form of\ndialysate. The cost of preparation depends upon\nestimates of the cost of the buffer, the costs of \nacid for the bicarbonate and an estimation of the\ncost of mixing the bicarbonate for the self-mixed\nbicarbonate. The information on the price of\nbicarbonate obtained from the manufacturers\nsuggests that bicarbonate is, on average, sold at \na substantial discount from the list price. Acetate,\nhowever, is sold on average, at a price roughly \nsimilar to the list price (G Anderson, Gambro;\npersonal communication, 1996). Therefore, the \ncosts of bicarbonate would tend to be at the lower\nvalues while the acetate would tend to be the \nhigher. Likewise, the cost of complications is also \nsplit into a high and low estimate. The values high-\nlighted in the two final columns represent the likely\ncost per session of acetate and bicarbonate. (Note\nthat only those areas where resource use is likely \nto differ between acetate and bicarbonate have \nbeen costed. For example, the same dialysis\nmachines can be used for both dialysates and \ndialysis sessions take the same time. Therefore, \nthe cost of the dialysis machines is not included \nin the evaluation).\nTABLE 20  The cost per patient per session of the alternative forms of dialysate and the different methods available for \ntheir preparation\nDialysate Type Cost Preparation Acid Total\n(\u00a3 per session) (\u00a3 per session) (\u00a3 per session) (\u00a3 per session)\nLow High Low High Low High\nBicarbonate Self mixa,b,c 1.90 2.10 1.05 2.45 3.15 5.40 6.30\nBicarbonate Dry concentratea,b 4.00 5.95 2.45 3.15 6.45 9.10\nBicarbonate Solutiona,b 4.90 6.30 2.45 3.15 7.35 9.45\nAcetate Solution\na,b 4.90 6.30 4.90 6.30\naThe same dialysis machine can be used for both acetate and bicarbonate haemodialysis\nb 8 litres of dialysate solution is required per patient\nc Mixing of dry powder takes one grade C nurse 1.5 hours to prepare a batch of 100 litres\nTABLE 21  The staff costs of complications\nComplication Staff time (hours) Consumable Combined costs (\u00a3)\nLow High \ncost (\u00a3)\nLow High\nMuscle cramp 0.083 0.5 0 0.99 3.94 \nHypotension 0.083 1.167 2.00 2.99 3.94 \nVomiting 0.25 0.75 0.50 3.47 8.86 \nTABLE 22  The probabilities of complications for both acetate\nand bicarbonate per patient per session\nComplication Acetate Bicarbonate\nMuscle cramps No significant difference\nHypotension 0.08 0.02\nVomiting 0.035 0.0154Appendix 5\n96\nThe cost of acetate and bicarbonate haemodialysis\nis heavily influenced by the cost of the dialysates\nthemselves. The results presented above show \nthat the episodes of hypotension, nausea and\nvomiting, and hypotension do decrease when\nbicarbonate buffer is used in preference to acetate\nbuffer. The overall level of complications with\nacetate, however, is not high and the reduction \nin complications due to the use of bicarbonate\ndialysate is not great. Therefore, even when it \nis assumed that all episodes of any complication\nrequire active treatment, the reduction in cost\ncaused by the reduction in complications requiring\ntreatment is small and does not greatly affect the\noverall results.\nCombining costs and benefits\nThe combination of the information on the relative\neffectiveness and cost of acetate and bicarbonate\nhaemodialysis can provide information on the\nrelative efficiency of the two alternatives. The avail-\nable information suggests that bicarbonate haemo-\ndialysis provides more benefits to patients than\nacetate haemodialysis at the same or lower cost. \nIn terms of the cost\u2013benefit framework described\nin Figure 3, the results suggest that we are in squares\nA1 or B2, marked \u2018Yes\u2019. In both these areas the\navailable evidence suggests that bicarbonate-\nbuffered haemodialysis is more efficient than\nacetate-buffered haemodialysis.\nDiscussion\nBicarbonate haemodialysis is no longer significantly\nmore expensive than acetate haemodialysis, at least\nin the UK. This is a dramatic change from the\nsituation of 5\u201310 years ago. The greater initial\nexpense of bicarbonate haemodialysis certainly\nslowed its uptake, even by those convinced of its\nclinical benefits. There have been no published\neconomic evaluations comparing the use of\nbicarbonate and acetate buffers. Given the \nreal but apparently quite small benefits of\nbicarbonate over acetate, an earlier economic\nevaluation would have found that bicarbonate\nwould have been more expensive but more\nbeneficial. The effect on cost is illustrated by \nthe results presented in Table 23, which indicates\nthat these costs are very sensitive to the costs of the\ndialysates. Over the last 5 years, use of bicarbonate\nhas increased and the price has fallen, whereas the\nuse of acetate has fallen and its price has remained\nvirtually unchanged. Initial studies suggested that\nbicarbonate haemodialysis had a modest superiority\nover acetate dialysis in terms of effectiveness. This\nsuperiority seemed to be most marked in relation\nto relatively small patient groups, such as those \nwith cardiac disease or with known acetate intoler-\nance. If bicarbonate dialysis had been restricted to\nthese groups, it is likely that the cost would have\nremained significantly higher than those for \nacetate haemodialysis and, in terms of Figure 3,\nbicarbonate haemodialysis relative to acetate\nhaemodialysis would fall in the shaded area C1. \nA judgement was implicitly made that the extra\nbenefits provided by bicarbonate haemodialysis\nrelative to acetate haemodialysis were worth the\nextra cost of bicarbonate. However, its general \nuse in the stable dialysis population has led to a\nsignificant drop in its cost, which has changed the\nrelative efficiency and moved bicarbonate haemo-\ndialysis to areas A1 or B2, thus indicating that it is\nmore efficient than acetate haemodialysis.\nCosts are derived from the estimates of resource \nuse taken from different studies. There are ques-\ntions as to how generalisable such data could be.\nThe quantity of resources consumed in any given\nsetting are influenced by their prices, which can \nand do vary between settings. One assumption\nmade, on the evidence from studies from different\ncountries (and, hence, facing very different unit\nprices) was that the cost of the dialysis session was\nthe same. Thus, any unit price differences in this\nsituation are not relevant. One area, however,\nwhere such differences are potentially relevant \nis in the determination of the cost of treating\nTABLE 23  The cost per patient per session of using alternative types of dialysate (assuming the same dialysis machine can be used for\nboth types of dialysate)\nDialysate Type Preparation  Cost of complications  Total cost \n(\u00a3 per patient per session) (\u00a3 per patient per session) (\u00a3 per patient per session)\nLow High Low High Low High\nBicarbonate Self mix 5.40 6.30 0.11 0.22 5.51  6.51 \nDry concentrate 6.45 9.10 0.11 0.22 6.67  9.32 \nPre-prepared 7.35 9.45 0.11 0.22 7.46 9.67 \nAcetate Pre-prepared 4.90 6.30 0.36 0.62 5.26 6.92Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n97\ncomplications. Staff time estimates were obtained\nfrom one American study. It is conceivable that the\ntime estimates could vary between countries. In the\ncontext of this study such variations are unimport-\nant because of the small overall probability of\ncomplications requiring treatment per session. A\nfurther issue is that it was not possible to gain cost\nestimates for the treatment of all complications.\nThe incidence of headaches and non-specific\nintolerance differed between acetate and\nbicarbonate haemodialysis with the difference\nfavouring bicarbonate. It was not possible to cost\nthe treatment of either headaches or non-specific\nintolerance but, given the results presented, it is\nlikely that this only strengthens the case for\nbicarbonate haemodialysis.\nConclusions and implication\nPolicy implications\n1. Bicarbonate dialysis is preferable to acetate\ndialysis for the haemodialysis of patients with\nESRD because of the associated reduction in\nintra-dialytic adverse symptoms and similar cost.\n2. In countries with less well-financed renal\nreplacement services, who continue to depend\non haemodialysis machines that can only use\nacetate-buffered dialysate, replacement of these\nmachines as replacements are required with\nthose that can use either dialysate should be\nencouraged. However, the cost to a healthcare\nsystem of a complete rapid change to new dialy-\nsis machines or modification of all their present\nmachines would not be warranted on the basis of\nthe relatively modest benefits which bicarbonate\ndialysis offers. The benefits of such changes need\nto be considered in terms of their opportunity\ncost and this will vary from country to country.\nThe provision of information on the costs and\nbenefits of such a change provided in this study\nshould assist in the estimation of such\nopportunity costs.\nFuture research needs\n1. Methodologically sound clinical trials with long-\nterm follow-up comparing bicarbonate with ace-\ntate haemodialysis are rare. We should continue\nto be open-minded about the possible beneficial\nor adverse effects that bicarbonate dialysis may\nhave on long-term outcomes such as lipid profile\nand cardiovascular disease, renal bone disease\nand morbidity.\n2. A further RCT at this stage is unlikely to produce\nsignificantly different data from that which we\nhave already and is therefore unlikely to change\nclinical practice.\nReferences\nStudies included in the review\nAkanji AO, Sacks S, 1991.

However, during the \n1980s, the annual mortality rate in patients in \nthe USA began to increase as the average dialysis\ntreatment times decreased (Berger et al., 1991;\nHeld et al., 1990). The trend towards shorter\ndialysis time was never as pronounced in Europe \nor Japan, both countries having a significantly\nlower annual mortality rate in dialysis patients \nthan the USA.\nIf short dialysis is at least comparable to standard\ndialysis in terms of clinical outcome, it should be\noffered to all appropriate patients. If, however,\nthere are significant disadvantages compared with\nstandard dialysis in either the short or long term,\nthen patients to whom it is offered should be made\naware of the potential trade-off.\nObjectives\nThe objective of this review is to ascertain \nwhether shortened rather than standard\nhaemodialysis treatment times affect the short- \nor long-term mortality, morbidity or quality of \nlife of patients with ESRD. It also attempts to \nassess patient preference and to estimate any\nimpact shortened dialysis times may have on\nhealthcare resource use. The hypotheses being\ntested are that shortened treatment times are\nassociated with:\n(i) no increase in mortality\n(ii) no increase in morbidity (both intra- \nand interdialytic)\n(iii) increased patient preference\n(iv) improved quality of life for patients.\nMaterials and methods\nCriteria for considering studies for \nthis review\nTypes of studies  An attempt was made to identify\nall trials comparing short duration (3.5 hours or\nless) haemodialysis treatment sessions (experi-\nmental group) with standard duration (more than\n3.5 hours) sessions (control group) in patients \nwith ESRD maintained on haemodialysis, in which\npatients were prospectively randomly (for example,\nsealed envelopes with third party involvement) or\nquasi-randomly (for example, alternate patients or\nalternate treatments) allocated to either treatment.\nCrossover trials in which treatments alternated at\nleast to the degree of A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B were also included,\neven if the allocation to first treatment was neither\nrandom nor quasi-random.\nTypes of participants  Patients with ESRD main-\ntained on haemodialysis irrespective of age, sex,\nrace, primary renal disease, vascular access or co-\nmorbidity. Trials which were exclusively comprised\nof patients with acute renal failure were excluded.\nThe definition of ESRD by each individual study\nwas accepted.\nTypes of intervention  Patients in the experimental\ngroup received short duration haemodialysis treat-\nment sessions of less than 3.5 hours per session\nwhile patients in the control group received stand-\nard duration haemodialysis treatment sessions of\nmore than 3.5 hours per session. Dialysis was under-\ntaken three times per week in both groups. Within\nthese parameters, the definition of short and\nstandard dialysis time for each individual study was\naccepted. Any variation in dialysis technique, such\nas bicarbonate dialysis, high-flux or high-efficiency\ndialysis membranes, dialysate-sodium modelling\nand high blood flow rates, were acceptable.\nHowever, studies that included haemofiltration or\nhaemodiafiltration treatments were excluded.\nTypes of outcome measures\n1.

Patient acceptability (any scale or \nmeasurement accepted).\n6.  Quality-of-life assessment (any scale or\nmeasurement accepted).\nSearch strategy for identification \nof studies\nThe search strategy used was one developed for \nthe identification of all possible RCTs or quasi-\nRCTs relating to the management of ESRD, and is\ndescribed in detail in chapter 2 and appendices 2\nand 3.\nMethods of the review\nIdentified studies were evaluated using a study\nevaluation form and those which met the eligibility\ncriteria (included references) were then consid-\nered in detail. Data were extracted using a data\nabstraction form designed for this review (see\nappendix 10). Review Manager v. 3.0 was used for\nthe analysis. A full description of the methods \nused is given in chapter 2.\nDescription of studies\nOnly a single study, the National Cooperative\nDialysis Study (Lowrie et al., 1983) met the inclusion\ncriteria for this review. The full study was published\nas a number of separate papers in a single volume \nof Kidney International in 1983. Each individual paper\nis listed in this review. A preliminary report of the\nstudy was published in New England Journal of Medi-\ncine in 1981 and is also listed although, apart from\ndata on hospitalisation rates, it contains no addi-\ntional information. The study covered the period\n1974\u201376. A total of 165 patients were randomised,\nand there were 85 withdrawals during the random-\nised phase. Patients were randomised to four groups,\neach determined by its dialysis time (short versus\nstandard) and its dialysis \u2018adequacy\u2019 (as defined by\nits \u2018prescribed\u2019 time-averaged concentration of urea\n\u2013 high versus low). A summary of the main features\nof the study is presented in Table 24.\nMethodological quality of the \nincluded study\nThe single study was a relatively large, partially\nbalanced, randomised controlled, open, parallel\n(during randomised phase), multicentre trial\nundertaken in the USA. Random allocation was \nby third party (the data coordinator at the lead\ncentre) using sequentially numbered sealed\nenvelopes. The sequence was generated before\ninitiating the study with the intention of producing\na partially balanced randomisation. There is a\ndetailed description of withdrawals and drop-outs\nfrom the start of the study to completion of the\nprotocol. This included all drop-outs and exclu-\nsions that occurred during the pre-randomisation\nphases. Data on mortality, first hospitalisations and\nwithdrawals for medical reasons were calculated on\nan intention-to-treat basis; other data were not.\nThere were relatively rigorous inclusion criteria\nboth before trial entry and before entry to the\nrandomised phase.\nResults\nThe results are derived from a single trial (Lowrie,\net al., 1983). They are grouped according to the\npre-stated outcome measures of this review:\n(i) mortality\n(ii)  intra- and interdialytic morbidity\n(iii) measures of dialysis adequacy\n(iv) patient quality of life and patient acceptability.\nData are presented as a comparison of short with\nstandard duration dialysis, subgrouped according\nto the prescribed dialysis of the allocated groups,\nstandard or low dialysis urea clearance. Dichoto-\nmous data are presented as ORs and continuous\ndata as WMDs (see Table 25, A and B).\nMortality\nOne patient from the experimental (short \nduration dialysis) and two patients from the \ncontrol group (standard duration) died during \nthe study (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.05, 5.15). Over \nthe study period and follow-up, seven patients \nin the experimental group and nine in the \ncontrol group died (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.28, \n2.21). Although there was no significant differ-\nence in mortality between the two treatment\ndurations, a clinically important difference \ncannot be ruled out.\nIntradialytic morbidity\nNo data relevant to intradialytic morbidity \ncould be used quantitatively in this review. \nThe single study noted \u201cstatistically significant\ndeviations only sporadically during the\nexperimental phase\u201d relative to a symptom\nquestionnaire which attempted to assess the \nseverity of adverse symptoms \u201ccommonly \nassociated with dialysis\u201d.Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n103\nTABLE 24  Characteristics of included studies:short versus standard duration treatments in haemodialysis of patients with ESRD\nStudy Method Participants Interventions Outcomes Notes\nLowrie,et al., Partially-balanced  165 patients with  Patients randomly  Mortality;intradialytic  Study divided into \n1983 parallel (randomised  ESRD;M:F,59.6:40.4; allocated to four  morbidity;general  several phases;final \nphase) RCT with  mean age (SD), groups:Group I \u2013  morbidity \u2013 withdrawals  phase (experimental) \nadequate concealment  49.0 (12.7) years; standard dialysis time  for medical reasons  was only phase with \nof allocation.Open  duration on dialysis  (4.5\u20135.0 hours),low  (excluding renal trans-  randomly allocated \nstudy,although \u201cclinical  (mean,SD),4.2 (2.3) years; BUN with time-averaged  plant),cardiovascular treatments;initiation \ninvestigators were  residual renal function: concentration of urea, morbidity,hospitalisation  phase \u2013 1 month,\nblinded to group  creatinine clearance  50 mg\/dl;Group II \u2013  rate,blood pressure  262 patients;control \noutcomes throughout  < 3 ml\/min;inclusion  standard dialysis time  control,symptom  (plus induction) phase \nthe study\u201d;detailed  criteria \u2013 age 18\u201370 years, (4.5\u20135.0 hours),high  questionnaire,EEG and  \u2013 12\u201320 weeks,\ndesciption of with-  RRT > 4 months, BUN with time-averaged  choice reaction time, 224 patients;experi- \ndrawals and drop-outs; creatinine clearance  concentration of urea, effect on haematopoietic  mental phase \u2013 165 \nsome data (mortality  < 3 ml\/min on centre  100 mg\/dl;Group III \u2013  system;measures of  patients;withdrawals,\nand withdrawals for  dialysis;no more than  short dialysis time  dialysis adequacy \u2013  drop-outs and failure \nmedical reasons)  one missed dialysis  (2.5\u20133.5 hours),low  time-averaged urea  to reach inclusion \nanalysed on an  treatment per month  BUN with time-averaged  concentration,midweek  criteria from initiation \nintention-to-treat  over previous 3 months, concentration of urea, pre-dialysis BUN, of study described \nbasis. average intradialytic  50 mg\/dl;Group IV \u2013  pre-dialysis phosphate, in detail.\nweight gain < 3.5 kg  short dialysis time  serum electrolytes, BUN 50 mg\/dl \nover previous 3 months, (2.5\u20133.5 hours),high  arterial blood gases  \u00bb BUN 20 mmol\/l;\naverage predialysis  BUN with time-  and pH.

The\nauthors of the included study concluded that \u201cno\nimportant changes in psychosocial measures can be\nattributed to the different treatment prescriptions\u201d.\nMeasures of dialysis adequacy\nMidweek predialysis blood urea concentration \nand time-averaged concentration of urea were \nused in the study as measures of dialysis adequacy.\nHowever, because dialysis treatments were manipu-\nlated to achieve a certain dialysis adequacy for each\ngroup, these measures were not used as outcome\ndata in this review.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this review show that significantly\nmore patients receiving short-duration dialysis were\nhospitalised. This group also had more withdrawals\nfor medical reasons, although this did not reach\nstatistical significance, and there was also a modest\ndeterioration in blood pressure control. There \nwas no clear difference between the groups in \nany of the other outcome measures considered.\nDialysis adequacy could not be used as an outcome\nmeasure because of the structure of the included\nstudy. However, a significantly greater number of\nwithdrawals for medical reasons were reported\nfrom the low urea clearance groups and, as a result,\nthe short-duration dialysis, low urea clearance\ngroup was discontinued early.\nDespite the extensive search strategy, only one study\nwas identified in which the inclusion criteria of this\nreview were satisfied (Lowrie, et al., 1983). Although\nthe study was multicentre and relatively large, it\ncomprised a highly selected population with\nrelatively strict inclusion criteria to enter the initial\nphase. Further criteria needed to be met for a\npatient to pass forward to the randomised phase \nof the study. The data may, therefore, be relevant\nonly to this highly selected group who were main-\ntained on dialysis in a particular healthcare system\nat a particular time (mid-1970s). The composition\nof the population on dialysis, the dialysis technology\nand the treatment options for patients with ESRD\nhave all changed since then. For example, older\npatients with greater co-morbidity are now accepted\non dialysis programmes (Port, 1994), bicarbonate\nhas become the standard dialysate buffer (Vallerra-\nbano, et al., 1996), and the treatment of anaemia\nhas been revolutionised by the introduction of EPO\n(Winearls, et al., 1986; Eschbach, et al., 1987). The\ngeneralisability of the results from this study to\npatients presently on dialysis and being managed \nby the presently accepted optimal treatment of\nESRD may be questionable.\nThe obvious significant methodological and\norganisational difficulties encountered and over-\ncome during the included study may, in part,\nexplain the lack of more recent RCTs in this area.\nDialysis clinical research has its own specific\nproblems. The relatively low prevalence of ESRD\nmeans that most reasonably sized trials need to be\nmulticentred. The high withdrawal and drop-out\nrate demonstrated by this study is likely to be an\ninevitable consequence of the morbidity of this\npopulation and the potential for withdrawal\nbecause of renal transplantation. This may have\nencouraged other researchers to attempt to \npredict long-term clinical outcomes from data \non surrogate outcomes derived from short-term\nstudies. However, the ability of these secondary\noutcome measures to predict long-term clinical\noutcomes remains open to question.\nDialysis adequacy and duration are interlinked.\nChanges in dialysis adequacy can be achieved by\naltering other dialysis technique parameters, such\nas blood flow rate, dialysis membrane size and\nmembrane flux. Reduced dialysis adequacy appears\nto have a definite adverse effect on outcome;\nhowever, whether reduced dialysis time alone \nhas an adverse effect is less clear.\nA large, multicentre, 2 \u00b4 2 factorial RCT, which\ncompares the effect of dialysis dose and membrane\nflux on survival of patients with ESRD, is currently\nbeing conducted in the USA and is due to be\ncompleted in 2001. The principal investigator \nof the study is Dr John Kusek of the National\nInstitutes of Health. The aim is to recruit 1700\npatients to the study; to date, more than 1000\npatients have been recruited. Although the results\nof the study may answer the questions of how \nmuch dialysis is needed and how that amount \nof dialysis may be delivered, the specific aim is \nto study the effect of different levels of dialysis\nadequacy as measured by Kt\/V (equilibrated Kt\/V\nof 1.05 versus 1.45) rather than dialysis duration \nper se. Preliminary baseline data has already been\nreported (Eknoyan, 1997; Levey, 1997; Maroni,\n1997; Meyer, 1997a; b). It may be that changes inAppendix 6\n108\nthe management of patients with ESRD, such as\nEPO, bicarbonate dialysis and high-flux membranes\nmay have altered the influence of dialysis duration\non clinical outcome.\nDialysis duration must seem a very fundamental\nconcept to patients, their relatives and purchasers\nof renal services. If dialysis time can be shortened\nsafely then this should be done. However, good\nevidence of such safety does not yet exist and, \nuntil it becomes available, the standard duration\nregimen should be continued. If short-duration\ndialysis is used, patients should be made aware \nthat its effects on morbidity and mortality \nremain unknown.\nGiven the interest in shortening the length of\nhaemodialysis sessions, it is disappointing that only\none RCT was identified that addressed this question.\nAn economic evaluation was attempted but there\nwas insufficient information to enable judgements \nto be made about the relative efficiency of short-\ncompared to standard-duration haemodialysis. \nIn particular, the RCT was not performed on an\nintention-to-treat basis, which meant that important\ninformation on patient outcomes was not collected\nwhen patients were withdrawn from the trial.\nConclusions and implications\nPolicy implications\n1. Current evidence is not reassuring that short-\nduration dialysis is as effective as standard-\nduration dialysis. There is no evidence that\nreduced dialysis duration improves patient\noutcome in terms of mortality and morbidity,\nand it may in fact increase morbidity as\nreflected by increased hospitalisation and\npoorer blood pressure control. Standard-\nduration dialysis should remain the\nrecommended treatment.\n2. If reduced dialysis duration regimens are\nimplemented on the basis of patient preference\nor cost, the fact that its safety is not proven\nshould be explicitly acknowledged.\nFuture research needs\n1. A large, multicentre, pragmatic RCT(s) that\ncompares haemodialysis treatment duration\npolicies is required. Such a trial should have\nminimum exclusion criteria, a long follow-up\nperiod and minimum data collection, concen-\ntrating primarily on patient morbidity and\nmortality. Follow-up should include patients\nwho withdraw (for example, for renal trans-\nplantation) and all patients should be followed\nfor a period after trial completion to assess the\nresidual effect on mortality and morbidity. Key\nprimary outcomes such as mortality should be\nanalysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Avoid-\nance of collection of secondary outcome data\nshould reduce the complexity of such a trial.\nDialysis therapy and the overall treatment of\nESRD within such a trial should be to the\nhighest standard, as recommended by the \nbest available evidence.\n2. If such a trial showed no advantage with\nstandard-duration dialysis, short-duration\ndialysis should become the recommended\ntreatment option.\n3. The HEMO RCT, comparing high- and low-flux\nmembranes and the ability to achieve a given\nKt\/V, is under way at present. It may address\nmany of the above questions. This should be\ntaken into account when the research agenda \nis decided.\nReferences\nStudies included in the review\nNote: these references all refer to one study; hence,\nthe citation (Lowrie, et al., 1983) refers to them all.\nLowrie E, Laird N, Henry R, 1983.

It may be used as the first\nchoice therapy, and in a number of countries \nmore patients are treated by CAPD than by haemo-\ndialysis. There is significant variation in catheter\nand transfer set types, insertion techniques, and\nperi- and postoperative management of patients.\nRates of complications (exit-site leak, exit-site\ninfection, subcutaneous tunnel infection, catheter\ncuff erosion or prolapse, catheter malfunction,\npericatheter hernia\/pseudohernia, posterior\nperitoneal perforation, postoperative bleeding,\nhollow viscus perforation) and catheter survival\nalso vary between centres,\nThere are two main types of catheter \nconnecting systems.\n1.  The standard or straight connecting system in\nwhich the catheter is connected with a straight\npiece of tubing which is, in turn, connected to\nthe dialysate bag. At each exchange the bag is\ndrained and a new connection is made. The\nempty bag is rolled up and remains attached\nuntil the next exchange when the process \nis repeated.\n2.  The Y-set in which, between exchanges, the\npatient is disconnected from dialysate bags and,\nwhen a new exchange is due, a Y-connection\nwith one limb connected to an empty bag and\none to a bag containing fresh dialysate is used.\nThe peritoneal dialysate is first drained into the\nempty bag. Before introducing the new fluid,\nthe Y-connector is flushed with fresh dialysate\ninto the drained bag. This allows any bacteria to\nbe flushed into the spent fluid. The fresh fluid is\nthen introduced into the peritoneal cavity and\nthe connector is removed from the catheter.\nAt present, about 40% of CAPD patients in the UK\nuse the standard system (data from Renal Registry,\npresented at Renal Association meeting, 1997).\nThe aim of this review is to describe the best\npractice for CAPD connecting systems, insofar as\npresent evidence allows, and to indicate areas for\nfuture research.\nObjective\nThe objective of  this review is to compare \nY-transfer set systems or their modification with\nstandard non-Y systems in CAPD.\nMaterials and methods\nCriteria for considering studies for \nthis review\nTypes of studies  All RCTs or quasi-RCTs addressing\nthe objective.\nTypes of participants  All CAPD patients newly\ncommenced on this modality of RRT were included\nin the studies considered.\nTypes of intervention  The use of Y-set (or\nmodifications thereof) using flush-before-fill \nand either hypochlorite or povidone iodine\ndisinfectant compared with standard non-Y-set\nconnection systems for the delivery of CAPD \nto patients starting on this modality of RRT.\nTypes of outcome measures  The following\noutcome measures were considered:\n(i) peritonitis\n(ii) exit-site  infections.\nSearch strategy for identification \nof studies\nThe search strategy used was one developed for \nthe identification of all possible RCTs or quasi-\nRCTs relating to the management of ESRD, and is\ndescribed in detail in chapter 2 and appendices 2\nand 3.\nAppendix 7\nSystematic review 4:Comparison of \nCAPD delivery systems \u2013 Y-set\/modified Y-set\nversus standard spike as treatment for patients \nwith ESRDAppendix 7\n112\nMethods of the review\nAll included studies were evaluated using a study\nevaluation form and those which met the eligibility\ncriteria (included references) were then con-\nsidered in detail. Data were extracted using a data\nabstraction form designed for this review (see\nappendix 10). Review Manager v. 3.0 was used for\nthe analysis. A full description of the methods used\nis given in chapter 2.\nDescription of studies\nA total of six studies met the inclusion criteria for\nthis review. Two reports were of the same study\n(Maiorca, et al., 1983a; b); hence the data were\nconsidered only once. All six studies were either\nRCTs or quasi-RCTs in which Y-transfer sets were\ncompared with standard non-Y-set systems. A\nsummary of the included studies is presented \nin Table 26.\nMethodological quality of \nincluded studies\nAll studies claimed to have random allocation and\nowing to the nature of the intervention, blinding\nwas not possible. The methods of randomisation\nwere adequately described in three studies (Cheng,\net al., 1994 (random number tables); Maiorca, et al.,\n1983a; b (envelopes); Canadian CAPD Clinical\nTrials Group, 1989 (variable blocking factor)). \nAll studies provided numbers and reasons for\npatient withdrawals and drop-outs.\nResults\nPeritonitis rates\nThe number of patients who experienced at \nleast one episode of peritonitis in all the studies\ncombined was significantly lower in patients using\nthe Y-set delivery systems (57\/194; OR, 0.30; 95%\nCI, 0.23, 0.53) compared with those assigned to \nthe non-Y-set systems (107\/201; OR, 0.87; 95% CI,\n0.51, 1.48). Only one study (Cheng, et al., 1994) \ndid not show this effect although all the studies\ndemonstrated a significant increase in the number\nof months per episode of peritonitis using Kaplan-\nMeier survival analysis. None of the studies pro-\nvided standard deviations for this statistic and,\nhence, no WMD could be obtained. All studies\nshowed that time to first peritonitis was longer \nwith use of Y-set\/modified Y-set systems.\nExit-site infections\nThere was no evidence of significant reductions \nin the number of patients who suffered exit-site \nor tunnel infections with the Y-set (39\/162 in the\ntreatment group and 44\/171 in the control group;\nOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.51, 1.48). The meta-analysis of\nthe results is presented in Table 27 (A and B).\nDiscussion\nThis review shows that use of the Y-set delivery\nsystems in CAPD significantly reduces the incidence\nof CAPD-related peritonitis. The flush-before-fill\ntechnique, combined with the use of a disinfectant\n(hypochlorite or povidone iodine) is considered to\nlead to this improvement. CAPD-related peritonitis\nis the Achilles heel of this modality of RRT and\nrepeated infections of the peritoneum and\/or\nintractable episodes of peritonitis are the major\ncauses of morbidity, technique failure and, often,\nmortality in such patients. This review clearly\ndemonstrates the benefit of Y-set delivery systems\nover non-Y-set systems in preventing this major\ncomplication of CAPD. The incidence of exit-site\ninfections was not affected by the delivery system.\nThis suggests that the reduction in peritonitis seen\nwith the Y-set systems is not consequent upon a\nreduction of exit-site infections but is probably\ncaused by the \u2018washing\u2019 of organisms in the tubing\nby the flush-before-fill technique.\nEconomic evaluation\nThe principles of economic evaluation are\ndescribed in detail in chapter 3 (page 9) including,\nin an economic framework, the manner in which\ncosts and outcome are related (see, in particular,\nTable 2 and Figure 3).\nAims\nCAPD is an alternative to haemodialysis in which\nvarious alternative techniques are used. One way \nin which techniques can vary is in the transfer set\ntypes that are used. The aim of this economic\nevaluation is to assess the relative efficiency, using\nthe framework of economic evaluation outlined \nin chapter 3, of Y-set systems or their modifications\ncompared with standard non-Y-set systems for\ndelivering CAPD. More specifically, the aims \nof this economic evaluation are:\n(i) to investigate the relative resources used and\nthe cost of Y-set systems or their modifications\ncompared with standard non-Y-set systems for\ndelivering CAPD, using data extracted from the\nidentified RCTs and non-randomised studies in\nwhich the two delivery systems are compared\n(ii)  to combine data on cost with those on \nbenefits to patients, from the systematic \nreview of effectiveness described above, Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n113\nTABLE 26  Characteristics of included studies:comparison of CAPD delivery systems \u2013 Y-set\/modified Y-set versus standard spike\nStudy Method Participants Interventions Outcomes Notes\nCanadian CAPD  RCT;numbers and  124 new CAPD patients  Y-connector  Peritonitis;exit-site  Hypochlorite \nClinical Trials  reasons for withdrawals  \u2013 from 159 consenting  (Amuchina) vs. infections;technique  disinfectant in Y-set.\nGroup,1989 stated;no mention of  patients eligible for inclusion, standard spike  survival (Kaplan-Meier).\nblinding;analysis on  61 in study group,63 in  (Baxter II and III).\nintention-to-treat  control group;M:F,not stated;\nbasis. exclusion criteria:age \n< 18 years,likely to die \nwithin 6 months,previous \ncomplications on CAPD.\nCheng,et al., RCT;numbers and  All 100 patients starting  Y-set (O-set) vs. Peritonitis;exit-site  Hypochlorite \n1994 reasons for withdrawal  CAPD over 2 years at  conventional spike vs. infections;costs. disinfectant used.\nstated;not clear if  a tertiary referral and  ultraviolet irradiation \nanalysis on intention-  satellite center;38 in  (excluded from \nto-treat basis;no  treatment group,31 in  this review).\nmention of blinding. control group;M:F,20:18 \nin treatment group,\n17:14 in control group;\ndiabetes,one in treatment \ngroup,three in control \ngroup;exclusion criteria:\nage < 10 or > 70 years,\nrenal transplant within \n6 months of treatment,\ninability to afford Y-set.\nDryden,et al., Prospective RCT; 80 patients,40 in  Y-set (Freeline Solo)  Peritonitis.

Only in those\nareas where there was likely to be some difference\nin resource use were costs identified. When \npatients were dialysed using either of the two\ndelivery systems, the identification of the relative\nresources used involved the following.\n1. Defining the process of care so that all \naspects of care in which resources were\nconsumed could be identified and compared.\nThe process of care comprises dialysis access\nand training, dialysis exchanges, dialysis main-\ntenance including routine outpatient visits,\ntreatment of complications and changes in\nmodality of treatment.\n2. All relevant information on resource use was\nabstracted from the RCTs on what resources\nwere used when utilisation differed between the\ntwo modes of delivery. The process was repeated\nfor those studies that were not randomised and\nthe information combined with estimates of the\nunit cost of the resources to determine the cost\ndifferential between Y-set systems and standard\nnon-Y-set systems for delivering CAPD using the\nmethodology described below. This differential\ncould then be compared with data on benefits \nto patients obtained from the systematic review\nof effectiveness.\nModel of costs\nFive main areas of resource use can be costed.\nThese reflect the sequence of the treatment process\noutlined above.\n1.  Catheter insertion  Peritoneal dialysis requires a\ncatheter to be inserted to provide access to the\nperitoneum. Haemodialysis may be required\nuntil peritoneal dialysis can be performed. For\nperitoneal dialysis using either delivery system\nthe process of inserting the catheter would be\nthe same; hence, the resources which would be\nconsumed would also be the same.\n2.  Training  Once the catheter has been inserted \na patient requires to be trained in the use of\nperitoneal dialysis. This training takes several\nweeks and can be performed as either an in- \nor outpatient procedure. While undergoing\ntraining, patients may require haemodialysis\nuntil they are trained in peritoneal dialysis. \nFor simplicity it has been assumed that the\nresources required for training are the same\nalthough the training may differ for each \nmode of delivery of CAPD.\n3. The dialysis process  Costs of capital items, any\nconsumables used and any staff inputs for the\nprocess of dialysis were calculated. Patients also\nrequired routine outpatient visits which were\nnot costed as they were assumed to be identical\nfor both Y-set and standard non-Y-set systems.\n4. Treatment of complications  The cost of\ntreating complications was also calculated by\nusing the model depicted in Figure 11. Data\nwere abstracted from the RCTs on the relative\nprobability of the complications. The review \nof RCTs and non-randomised studies attempted\nto identify the precise treatment that was pro-\nvided for a specific complication. The treat-\nments were then costed according to the staff,\nconsumables, overheads and capital that the\ntreatment consumed. The price of any pharma-\nceuticals consumed was taken from the BNF\n(BMA, 1996), and the cost of staff time was\nestimated by combining information on time\nwith that from the relevant UK NHS salary\nscales (NHS, 1996a; b).\n5. Changes in modality and death  Costs (and out-\ncomes) would be determined by the probability\nof technique failure and transplantation over \na given period (e.g. a month or year). The\nprobability of technique failure can be divided\ninto the probability of transferring to another\nmode of treatment, for example, transplant-\nation, or dying, so allowing the inclusion, if\nnecessary, of the cost of managing patients \nafter they had switched modality.\nA simplified version of how these costs and\nprobabilities can be modelled is shown in \nFigure 11. For any given period a patient would\nincur the cost of treatment (the CAPD exchanges)\nand the cost of a complication (based on the \ncost of treating that complication once it has\noccurred and the probability of the complication\noccurring). At the end of that time, a patient \nwould have the chance of \u2018dropping-out\u2019 of treat-\nment by either dying or receiving a renal transplant\nor transferring to another mode of dialysis (where\nappropriate the costs would be estimated). If the\npatient does not drop out then they return to\nanother period of CAPD (indicated in Figure 11 \nby the movement from \u2018A1\u2019 back to \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B1\u2019 \nback to \u2018B\u2019).\nResults\nBenefits to patients\nThe number of patients who experienced one\nepisode of peritonitis was significantly lower in\npatients using the Y-set delivery system (57\/194)\ncompared with the standard non-Y-set system\n(107\/201). There was no significant increase \nin the number of patients who suffered exit-site \nor tunnel infections.Appendix 7\n116\nResource use and costs\nThe principle cost differences between the Y-set\nand standard non-Y-set systems for delivering \nCAPD result from differences in the cost of the \ntwo processes of dialysis and the cost of treatment\nof complications.\nResources used before and during the \ndialysis session\nIt has been assumed that the resources used and\nthe costs of the initial insertion of the catheter \nand of training the patient to use their designated\nmode of peritoneal dialysis are the same for both\nmethods of delivery.\nCost of peritoneal dialysis\nThe cost per patient per month of Y-set and\nstandard non-Y-set systems for delivering CAPD \nare shown in Tables 28 and 29. It includes the\ncapital costs and the cost of consumables used in\nthe dialysis process. The cost of routine check-ups\nhave, however, not been included as these have\nbeen assumed to be the same for patients treated\nby either the Y-set or the standard non-Y-set system.\nAll exchanges are assumed to be performed by the\npatient or the patient\u2019s carer. The time that the\npatient or carer spends in performing exchanges\nhas not been estimated but may differ between the\ntwo modalities.\nCost of complications\nThe evidence presented in the \u2018benefits to patients\u2019\nsection above suggests that the rate of peritonitis\ndiffered between patients dialysed with either Y-set\nor standard non-Y-set systems. Insufficient data were\nreported in the systematic review of effectiveness\nfor an economic analysis to be undertaken. The\nonly outcome measure for peritonitis suitable for\nmeta-analysis did not provide any information on\nthe period over which data was collected on\nperitonitis or the number of peritonitis episodes\nthat occurred within that period.

There was\nalso insufficient evidence to suggest that the prob-\nability of technique failure is different (analogous\nto \u2018drop-out\u2019 in Figure 11). Of the three studies that\nreported technique failure, the Canadian CAPD\nClinical Trials Group (1989) found no statistically\nsignificant differences in technique survival\nbetween patients started on CAPD with the Y-set\ncompared with the standard non-Y-set systems.\nCheng and colleagues (1994) reported that the\ntechnique survival was comparable and Dryden and\ncolleagues (1992) reported technique failure to be\ngreater in patients receiving CAPD with the stand-\nard non-Y-set system than with the Y-set system. This\nresult, however, was not statistically tested.\nThe estimates for the relative probability of\ndeveloping peritonitis for patients who started \non CAPD with Y-set system and the standard \nnon-Y set systems are shown in Table 30. As no\nsingle estimate could be obtained from meta-\nanalysis, high, medium and low estimates of cost\nhave been calculated from data in the literature.\nThese estimates are based upon the number of\npatient-months of care, on average, before one\nepisode of peritonitis occurred.\nThe cost per episode of peritonitis is shown in \nTable 31.\nUsing the model depicted in Figure 11, the data\nincluded in Tables 28\u201331 can be used to calculate the\nrelative cost per patient of CAPD using either the Y-\nset or standard non-Y-set system. A summary of the\nsensitivity analysis of the incremental cost of patients\ntreated on the Y-set and standard non-Y-set system is\nshown in Table 32. The high and low estimates are\nbased on the assumptions that are most favourable\nand least favourable to the Y-set system. For example,\nfor the low estimate presented in Table 32, the calcu-\nlation of cost is based upon the low cost of CAPD\nusing the Y-set system (see Table 28) minus the cost of\nthe non-Y-set system (see Table 29) plus the high cost\nof peritonitis treatment (Table 31) which has been\nTABLE 28  The cost per month per patient of CAPD using the \nY-set system\nItem Number  Cost per  Cost per \nof items  item     month \nper day (\u00a3) (\u00a3)\nLow High Low High\n2 litre fluid 4 4.7 5.3 571.83 644.83\nCap 4 0.45 0.45 54.75 54.75\nShield 4 0.45 0.45 54.75 54.75\nTotal 681 754\nTABLE 29  The cost per patient per month of CAPD using the\nnon-Y-set system\nItem Number  Cost per  Cost per \nof items  item  month \nper day (\u00a3) (\u00a3)\n2 litre fluid 4 3.5 425.83\nTransfer set  9.3 0.77\n(one per year)\nTotal 427\nTABLE 30  The extra probability of an episode of peritonitis \nper month for patients who started CAPD with the standard \nnon-Y-set system compared with patients who started CAPD \nwith the Y-set system\nRelative Data  source\nprobability \nper month\nLow 0.014 Cheng,et al.,1994\nMedium  0.054 Canadian CAPD Clinical \nTrials Group,1989;\nMaiorca,et al.,1983b\nHigh 0.129 Owen,et al.,1992\nTABLE 31  Cost per episode of peritonitis\nItem of resource use Cost per episode (\u00a3)\nLow High\n10-day course of antibiotics\nVancomycin (10 vials 250 mg \nplus 2 \u00b4 500 mg injections) 65 65\nSerum concentration \n(1 per day) 300 300\nSyringe 12 12\nHospitalisation \n(0 for \u2018Low\u2019,5 days for \u2018High\u2019) 0 996\nTotal 377 1373Appendix 7\n118\nmultiplied by the high probability of avoiding a\nperitonitis episode by using the Y-set system (see\nfigures from Owen et al., 1992, in Table 30).\nCombining costs and benefits\nThe combination of the information on the relative\neffectiveness and cost of the Y-set and standard non-\nY-set systems for CAPD can provide information on\nthe relative efficiency of the alternatives. The avail-\nable information on benefits suggests that the Y-set\nsystem provides more benefits to patients than the\nstandard non-Y-set system. Crucial information\nrequired to estimate the cost was not available in a\nsufficiently robust form to allow a definitive calcu-\nlation of cost. Therefore, in terms of the framework\ndescribed in Figure 3 (page 10), the results suggest\nthere is insufficient evidence on costs to make a\njudgement on the relative efficiency of the two deliv-\nery systems (area D1 on the matrix linking effective-\nness and cost). If the available information is used,\nthen the Y-set systems are both more effective and\nmore costly than the non-Y-set systems (area C1 of\nthe matrix). In this area a judgement is required on\nwhether the extra benefits are worth this additional\ncost. Additional information can be obtained from\nthe data by using incremental analysis, that is, by\nidentifying the extra resources required to achieve\none more of a beneficial effect. This allows a more\nexplicit consideration of the opportunity cost of Y-set\nsystems in preference to the non-Y-set systems. An\nopportunity cost is defined in terms of the benefits\nthat could have been obtained if the resources were\nused in their next best alternative use. The conse-\nquence of using limited resources in one way is that\nthe opportunities to use them in other desirable\nways are forfeited. The cost of that decision is the\nbenefit that could have been obtained by using the\nresources in other desirable ways.\nUsing the data shown in Tables 30 and 32, the\nadditional cost of preventing one case of peritonitis\nwhen patients are started on CAPD using the Y-set\nrather than the non-Y-set system can be calculated\n(Table 33). In this table, it is important to note that\nthe higher the probability of avoiding a case of\nperitonitis then the lower the cost of the more\neffective Y-set at preventing peritonitis.\nThe low and high cost-effectiveness ratios shown in\nTable 33 are based upon the very best and the very\nworst assumptions considered when comparing \nY-set with non-Y-set systems.\nDiscussion\nIt was not possible to definitively estimate the rela-\ntive costs of the two delivery systems and, hence, it\nwas not possible to estimate relative efficiency.\nAvailable data suggested that the Y-set system was\nmore effective but more costly than the non-Y-set\nsystem. A judgement is therefore required as to\nwhether the additional costs of starting a patient on\nCAPD using the Y-set system are worth the addition-\nal benefits it provided compared with starting a\npatient on CAPD using the non-Y-set system.\nIt has been assumed that technique survival is the\nsame with both delivery systems. The two studies that\nexplicitly report technique survival (Canadian CAPD\nClinical Trials Group, 1989; Dryden et al., 1992)\nreported that survival was greater with the Y-set\nsystem but that the difference failed to reach statis-\ntical significance and that it was not possible to per-\nform a meta-analysis of this data. If patients using\nthe non-Y-set method have more chance of switching\nto haemodialysis because of technique failure, then\nthis would tend to improve the relative efficiency of\nthe Y-set system compared to the non-Y-set system.\nWith respect to this economic evaluation a number\nof comments can be made. Costs are derived from\nestimates of resource use and probabilities which are\ndirectly taken from studies conducted in different\nsettings. There are questions as to how generalisable\nTABLE 32  The incremental cost of CAPD per patient per month\nof the Y-set and standard non-Y-set systems\nAdditional cost of Y-set  Cost per patient \nover non-Y-set per month (\u00a3)\nLow 77\nMedium 254\nHigh 322\nTABLE 33  The additional cost per patient on CAPD with the Y-set system for episodes of peritonitis avoided\nAdditional cost per  Reduction in probability of  The extra cost (\u00a3) per patient \npatient per month (\u00a3) peritonitis with Y-set system per case of peritonitis avoided\nLow 77 High 0.129 597\nMedium 254 Medium 0.054 4704\nHigh 322 Low 0.014 23,000Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n119\nsuch data could be. The quantity of resources con-\nsumed in any given setting are influenced by their\nprices which can, and do, vary between settings.\nFurther work is required to establish differences \nin the long-term costs and outcomes of the two\nmethods of CAPD delivery. It may be possible, using\nsensitivity analysis, to gain robust estimates of long-\nterm costs and outcomes by identifying data from\nwell-designed prospective observational studies.\nConclusions and implications\nPolicy implications\nPeritonitis is one of the main complications of\nCAPD and is known to lead to morbidity, technique\nfailure and mortality. Based on the results of this\nreview, there is insufficient evidence to support the\ncontinued use of non-Y-set connecting systems in\nCAPD. The economic evaluation of this review re-\nveals that the use of a Y- or modified Y-set connector\nimposes an incremental cost of \u00a377\u2013322, based on\nlow and high cost estimates. The additional cost of\nthe Y-set system is \u00a3327 compared with the standard\nsystem (Baxter Ltd, personal communication). In\norder to prevent one episode of peritonitis, how-\never, wide variations in cost for Y-set or modified \nY-set systems were estimated depending on the\nrelative probability of peritonitis per month.\nIf it is assumed that there is a higher incidence of\ntechnique failure with standard set systems, then\nthe use of the Y-set or modified Y-set system is \ncost efficient.\nFuture research needs\nPeritonitis remains a major problem in CAPD and\nfurther research into methods of prevention of this\ncomplication is required.\nReferences\nStudies included in the review\nCanadian CAPD Clinical Trials Group, 1989.

CCPD, in which \nmost of the dialysis exchanges are performed\nduring the night with the aid of an automated\ncycler machine is a modification of CAPD. In\nCAPD, at least four 1.5\u20133.0 litre exchanges are\nrequired daily; each exchange must be performed\nby the patient (or carer). However, in CCPD \nonly one connection\/disconnection procedure \nis required; all the exchanges (variable number \nand variable volume) are performed auto-\nmatically by the automate cycler machine. \nCCPD was initially introduced as an alternative \nto CAPD for those patients who experienced\ndifficulty with CAPD or in whom it could be\npredicted that difficulty with CAPD might be\nencountered. For example, parents of young\nchildren with ESRD could be freed from per-\nforming daytime exchanges and older children\nwould no longer have to perform exchanges \nat school, away from the privacy and controlled\nenvironment of their homes. Patients who had\ndifficulty performing CAPD exchanges because \nof a disability, such as a neurological deficit \nor reduced vision, could benefit either from \nthe reduced number of procedures or the\npossibility that a relative or partner could \nperform the connection\/disconnection \nprocedures (Diaz-Buxo, 1985). Patients who \nhave a rapid rate of solute transfer across \ntheir peritoneal membranes (high transporters)\nwere also considered to be likely to benefit \nfrom CCPD, because of the ability to perform \nrapid frequent exchanges with short \ndwell-times.\nMore recently, CCPD has been proposed as \nan alternative to CAPD for all patients in whom\nperitoneal dialysis is appropriate (Diaz-Buxo,\n1985). In patients with a strong medical or \nsocial indication for the adoption of CCPD, the\nbenefits may be so convincing that waiting for\nsupporting evidence from CCTs may not be\njustified. However, the adoption of this new\ntreatment modality as an option for patients \nwho could be adequately managed by the \nstandard treatment (CAPD) does need to be\njustified by evidence of clinical benefit from \nclinical trials. If the benefits are mainly social,\nrelating to patient preference, patients and \nhealthcare purchasers need to know if CCPD \nhas any extra cost in terms of morbidity\/\nmortality or resource use (Woodrow, et al., \n1994) in order to make informed decisions.\nHowever, CCPD may actually have clinical \nas well as psychosocial benefits; some authors \nhave reported a reduced incidence of \nperitonitis with CCPD compared with \nCAPD (Dias-Buxo, 1985; Brunkhorst, \net al., 1994).\nObjective\nThe objective of this review is to compare CCPD\nwith CAPD in the management of patients with\nESRD. The hypotheses being tested are that,\ncompared with patients on CAPD, those on \nCCPD have:\n(a) a reduced frequency of peritoneal \ndialysis-associated peritonitis\n(b) a reduced frequency of exit-site and \ntunnel infections\n(c) a reduced frequency of peritoneal dialysis\ncatheter changes\n(d) a reduced incidence of abdominal hernias,\nhydrothoraces and exit-site leaks\n(e) a reduced incidence of technique failure \n(the need to change to other dialysis \nmethods, such as haemodialysis)\n(f) improved blood pressure control\n(g) improved control of hyperkalaemia \n(a measure of dialysis adequacy)\n(h) improved adequacy of dialysis as \nmeasured by serum urea, creatinine, \nKt\/V and PCR\n(i) reduced rate of hospitalisation\n(j) improved patient survival\n(k) improved nutritional status (as reflected \nby serum albumin levels)\nAppendix 8\nSystematic review 5:Comparison of \nCCPD with CAPD as treatment for patients \nwith ESRDAppendix 8\n122\n(l) improved quality of life and general \nwell-being\n(m) a preference for CCPD\n(n) similar resource use demands.\nMaterials and methods\nCriteria for considering studies for \nthis review\nTypes of studies  An attempt was made to identify\nall trials comparing CCPD (experimental group)\nwith CAPD (control group) in the management \nof patients with ESRD in which the patients \nwere prospectively randomly (for example, using\nsealed envelopes with third party involvement) \nor quasi-randomly (alternate patients or alternate\ntreatments) allocated to either treatment. Cross-\nover trials in which treatments alternated at least \nto the degree A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B were also to be included,\neven if the allocation to first treatment was neither\nrandom nor quasi-random.\nTypes of participants  Patients with ESRD who \nwere suitable for both CCPD or CAPD, irrespec-\ntive of age, sex, race, primary renal disease or co-\nmorbidity. Trials which were exclusively comprised\nof patients with acute renal failure were excluded.\nEach individual study\u2019s definition of ESRD \nwas accepted.\nTypes of intervention  The experimental treatment\n(CCPD) comprised night-time exchanges perform-\ned by an automated cycler machine in the patient\u2019s\nhome. Patients may have also performed one or\nmore daytime cycles (manually or otherwise). The\ncontrol treatment (CAPD) comprised a variable\nnumber of manual peritoneal dialysis exchanges\nperformed during the day by either the patient \nor an assistant. An overnight in-dwelling exchange\nmay also have been performed. None of the con-\ntrol exchanges were performed by an automated \ncycle machine. Studies which included patients \non intermittent peritoneal dialysis (peritoneal\ndialysis performed by an automated cycler machine\nfor a prolonged period two or three times per week\neither in hospital or in the patient\u2019s home) \nwere excluded.\nTypes of outcome measures\n1.

Data were extracted\nusing a data abstraction form designed for this\nreview (see appendix 10). Review Manager v. \n3.0 was used for the analysis). For a full \ndescription of the methods used, see \nchapter 2.\nDescription of studies\nOnly one study met the inclusion criteria (de \nFijter, et al., 1994); 97 unselected patients with\nESRD were randomised, 47 to CCPD and 50 to\nCAPD. However, following withdrawals and drop-\nouts before commencing dialysis, only 41 patients\nreceived CCPD and 41 patients received CAPD.\nThe study was conducted at a single centre in a\nuniversity hospital setting (otherwise patients \nwere unselected) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nThe main characteristics of the study are\nsummarised in Table 34.\nMethodological quality of \nincluded studies\nThe single study found was a randomised parallel\nopen trial with a clear description of withdrawals\nand drop-outs (see Table 34).Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n123\nResults\nThe meta-analysis of the results from the \nincluded study (de Fijter, et al., 1994) are \nshown in Table 35 (A and B).\nInfective complications\nThere were no significant differences in the\nnumbers of patients who had one or more \nepisodes of:\n\u2022 peritonitis (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.24, 1.33)\n\u2022 exit-site infection (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.43, 2.94)\n\u2022 tunnel infection (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.05, 4.99).\nInfective complications were also reported as\nepisodes per patient-year. There was a significantly\ndecreased mean incidence per patient-year of\nperitonitis \u2013 0.51 (CCPD) compared with 0.94\n(CAPD) (p = 0.03) \u2013 but no difference in the \nmean incidence of exit-site infection \u2013 0.38 \n(CCPD) and 0.38 (CAPD).\nTechnique survival\nFewer patients allocated to CCPD changed mode \nof dialysis (excluding real transplants and recovery\nof renal function but including change between \nthe two methods of peritoneal dialysis under assess-\nment). The OR was 0.48 but the difference was not\nstatistically significant (95% CI, 0.18, 1.26). Simi-\nlarly, fewer patients in the CCPD group switched \nto haemodialysis but again the difference was \nnot statistically significant (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, \n0.14, 1.56).\nSeven patients on CCPD compared with 11 patients\non CAPD required peritoneal dialysis catheter\nremoval (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.20, 1.61). The\ndifference was reported as being related to \ninfective complications.\nMechanical complications\nThere were equal numbers of abdominal hernias\n(OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.19, 5.22) and hydrothoraces\n(OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.06, 16.27) in both groups. \nExit-site leaks were not reported.\nDialysis adequacy\nThere was no significant difference in Kt\/V at \n6 months (WMD, 0.40; 95% CI, \u20130.23, 1.03). this\nstudy also reported no significant difference in \n6-monthly serum creatinine, urea and phosphate.\nBlood pressure control\nNo data were presented which could be used in the\nmeta-analyses; however, there were no significant\ndifferences in reported 6-monthly mean arterial\nblood pressure measurements.\nQuality of life and general well-being\nPatients\u2019 performance status was recorded at \n6-monthly intervals using a Karnofsky score. \nThere was no significant difference between \nthe two groups.\nHospitalisation\nFewer patients allocated to CCPD were judged \nto require hospitalisation, although this was not\nTABLE 34  Characteristics of included studies:CCPD versus CAPD in treatment of patients with ESRD\nStudy Method Participants Interventions Outcomes Notes\nde Fijter,et al., Parallel RCT; 97 consecutive unselected  Randomised to CCPD  Infective complications:\n1994 randomisation  new patients with  or CAPD;duration of  episodes of peritonitis,\nmethod not  ESRD;drop-outs after  study:CCPD follow-up, exit-site and tunnel \ndescribed;blinding  randomisation but before  723 patient months, infections;removal of \nnot mentioned; dialysis commenced  CAPD follow-up, catheter;technique \nnumbers and reasons  resulted in 41 patients in  688 patient months; survival;number of \nfor withdrawals and  each group;median age \u2013  CCPD prescription: abdominal hernias,\ndrop-outs given; CCPD,54 years (range, PAC-X cycler,4\u20135  hydrothoraces;dialysis \nanalysis not on  21\u201376 years),CAPD, nocturnal cycles, adequacy,serum \nintention-to-treat  56 years (18\u201386 years); 1 diurnal cycle, creatinine,Kt\/V;\nbasis.

Although this study\nappeared to be well conducted, its value is limited\nby its small sample size (82 patients in total). The\nresults tended to favour CCPD in respect of a\nreduction in infective complications, reduced\ntechnique failure and reduced need for hospital-\nisation but none of the differences in these pre-\nstated measures reached conventional levels \nof statistical significance. When expressed as\nepisodes per patient-year, there were statistically\nsignificantly fewer episodes of peritonitis and\nhospital admission. These findings increase the\nlikelihood that the other findings reflect true\ndifferences between the techniques. Because \nit was a parallel study and all the patients were \nnew to dialysis at its commencement, patient\npreference was not reported.\nThe use of CCPD as an alternative to CAPD\ntherefore receives some support from this study. \nIt suggests that where the option of CCPD is being\noffered on the basis of patient preference, conveni-\nence is not being paid for by increased morbidity\nand mortality. However, the capital outlay for the\nextra machines and the larger volume of peritoneal\ndialysate used makes CCPD significantly more\nexpensive than CAPD. While controversy persists\nabout the size of any benefits, a general change\ntowards CCPD from CAPD for patients on chronic\nperitoneal dialysis is not yet warranted.\nThe generalisability of this review is obviously \nalso hampered by its dependence on a single \nstudy. This was a single centre study and, \nalthough 97 patients were randomised, the\npredictable attrition rate from drop-outs resulted \nin there being only 24 patients in the final \n24-month review. Further studies, preferably\nmulticentre studies, are needed to produce \nmore precise estimates of the differences between\nCCPD and CAPD suggested by this study. Peri-\ntonitis is the most frequent major complication \nof all forms of peritoneal dialysis. It results in\nsignificant morbidity, mortality and dialysis\ntechnique failure. If future studies confirm \na significant reduction in its frequency with \nCCPD, then CCPD should become the preferred\noption in chronic peritoneal dialysis.\nFuture RCTs on this topic should, like this study,\nconcentrate on primary outcomes of major clinical\nimportance, such as peritonitis, technique failure\nand mortality. The fact that none of 98 new patients\nwith ESRD had an absolute contraindication to peri-\ntoneal dialysis counters the argument that patient\nnumbers in RCTs comparing different modes of\ndialysis would be significantly limited by exclusion\ncriteria dictated by contraindications to specific\ndialysis modes. CCPD should not be viewed solely as\nan alternative to CAPD. Although more expensive\nthan CAPD, it may have less resource demands than\nhospital haemodialysis and may be a viable alter-\nnative, even when there is a relative contraindication\nto CAPD (for example, when significant input from\na partner or assistant is required).\nEconomic evaluation\nIntroduction\nThe principles of economic evaluation are\ndescribed in detail in chapter 3 (page 9) including,\nin an economic framework, the manner in which\ncosts and outcome are related (see, in particular,\nTable 2 and Figure 3).\nAims\nCCPD is a modification of CAPD in which dialysate\nexchanges are automatically performed by an\nautomated cycler machine. It is considered that\nCCPD offers additional benefits over CAPD in that\nit provides a more acceptable lifestyle for patients\nand a reduced risk of peritonitis. The relative\nefficiency of these alternatives will be investigated\nusing the framework of economic evaluation\noutlined in chapter 3. More specifically, the \naims of this economic evaluation are:\n(i)  to investigate the relative resources used \nand the cost of CCPD and CAPD using data\nextracted from the identified RCTs and non-\nrandomised studies in which CCPD and \nCAPD are compared\n(ii)  to combine data on the difference in costs with\ndata on differential benefits to patients from\nthe systematic review of effectiveness described\nabove in order to assess the relative efficiency\nof dialysis with CCPD or CAPD.\nMethods\nData collection\nThe methods used are described in detail in\nchapter 3 of the main report.Appendix 8\n128\nBenefits to patients\nThe systematic review of RCTs or quasi-RCTs\ndescribed above had as its main objective the\nsynthesis of the effectiveness data from the RCTs.\nInformation was extracted from the RCTs on \nthe following:\n(a)  the frequency of peritoneal dialysis-\nassociated peritonitis\n(b) the frequency of exit-site and \ntunnel infections\n(c) the frequency of peritoneal dialysis \ncatheter changes\n(d) the incidence of abdominal hernias,\nhydrothoraces and exit-site leaks\n(e) the dialysis technique survival\n(f) blood pressure control\n(g) the control of hyperkalaemia\n(h) the adequacy of dialysis as measured by \nserum urea, creatinine and Kt\/V\n(i) the hospitalisation rate\n(j) patient survival\n(k) patient nutritional status\n(l) patient quality of life and general \nwell-being \n(m) patient preference for modality type.\nIdentification of resource use and costs\nThe comparison of the resources used by the two\nforms of peritoneal dialysis focused only on those\nareas where there was likely to be some difference\nin resource use. The identification of the relative\nresources used when treating patients with either\nCCPD or CAPD involved four steps.\n1.  The definition of the process of care so that \nall items of resource use could be identified.\nDifferent quantities of resources could poten-\ntially be consumed during the initial catheter\ninsertion, the training process, the dialysis pro-\ncess (which would involve routine checks on\nthe patients\u2019 status) and the treatment of any\ncomplications that might occur.\n2.  The extraction of all relevant information \nfrom the RCTs.\n3.  The assessment of the data on resource \nuse contained in the studies that were \nnot randomised.\n4.  The information on resource use (obtained \nin steps 2 and 3) could then be combined with\ninformation on the unit cost of the resources \nto determine the cost differential between\nCCPD and CAPD using the methodology\ndescribed below. This differential could then \nbe compared with data on differential benefits\nto patients obtained from the systematic \nreview of effectiveness.\nModel of costs\n1.  Catheter insertion  Peritoneal dialysis requires a\ncatheter to be inserted to provide access to the\nperitoneum. Haemodialysis may be required\nuntil peritoneal dialysis can be performed. \nFor both types of peritoneal dialysis the process\nof catheter insertion is the same. Thus the\nresources consumed would also be the same.\n2. Training  Once the catheter is inserted \na patient is trained to carry out peritoneal\ndialysis. This training takes several weeks and\ncan be performed on an in- or outpatient basis.\nPatients may require haemodialysis during the\ntraining period. For simplicity, it has been\nassumed that the resources required for\ntraining are the same. This assumption is\ndiscussed below.\n3.  The dialysis process  This includes the costs \nof capital items, consumables used, any staff\ninputs for the process of dialysis and the\nresources used during routine outpatient visits.\nThe capital resources and consumables used\nwere identified from de Fijter and colleagues\n(1994) and combined with information on\nprices obtained from manufacturers to obtain\nthe cost of these items for a 1-year period.\nAlthough patients also require routine out-\npatient visits (information on the resources\nconsumed and the frequency of these out-\npatient visits can be obtained from Coyte and\ncolleagues (1996)), these visits were not costed\nas they were assumed to be identical for both\nCCPD and CAPD.\n4.  Treatment of complications  The relative cost\nof treating complications associated with the\ndifferent methods of peritoneal dialysis was \nalso calculated, using the model depicted in\nFigure 12 was used. If the patient does not \ndrop out, then they return to another period \nof peritoneal dialysis (indicated in Figure 12 \nby the movement from \u2018A1\u2019 back to \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B1\u2019\nback to \u2018B\u2019). From the report by de Fijter and\ncolleagues (1994), data were extracted on the\nproportion of patients who were treated for \na specific complication, such as peritonitis,\ncatheter infection or hernia, within a 1-year\nperiod. The review of the RCTs and non-\nrandomised studies attempted to identify the\nprecise treatment that was provided for a\nspecific complication. These were then costed\naccording to the staff times, consumables used,\noverhead costs and capital costs of the treat-\nment. The price of any pharmaceuticals con-\nsumed was taken from the BNF (BMA, 1996)\nand the cost of staff time was estimated by com-\nbining information on time with that from the\nrelevant UK NHS salary scales (NHS, 1996a; b).Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n129\nThe analysis in this paper is based on intention-to-\ntreat. The RCTs were thus reviewed in order to\nidentify information on the proportion of patients\nwho suffered technique failure or had renal trans-\nplants. Also recorded was the time delay to any\nswitch in treatment.\nResults\nBenefits to patients\nThe results of the systematic review of effectiveness\ndata were reported earlier. In brief, the systematic\nreview identified only one RCT that met the inclu-\nsion criteria for the study (de Fijter, et al., 1994).\nThere was no significant difference in the numbers\nof patients receiving CAPD or CCPD who had one\nor more episodes of: peritonitis (OR, 0.56; 95% CI,\n0.24, 1.33), exit-site infection (OR, 1.13; 95% CI,\n0.43, 2.94) or tunnel infection (OR, 0.5; 95% CI,\n0.05, 4.99). Infectious complications, when report-\ned as episodes of peritonitis per patient per year,\nwere significantly decreased (CCPD, 0.51; CAPD,\n0.94; p = 0.03) but there was no difference in the\nnumber of exit-site infections (CCPD, 0.38; CAPD,\n0.38). There was no significant difference in the\nnumber of patients who changed mode of dialysis.\nThere was also no differences in the numbers of\nabdominal hernias and hydrothoraces. The inci-\ndence of exit-site leaks, however, was not reported.\nNo significant differences were found between\nCCPD and CAPD for dialysis adequacy, blood\npressure control, quality of life\/general well-being,\nnutritional status or mortality.\nThere was no significant difference in the number\nof patients hospitalised (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.21,\n1.20). There was, however, a significant difference\nin the hospital admissions per patient-year of\ntreatment \u2013 data which could not be calculated \nas an OR (CCPD, 0.6; CAPD, 1.0; p = 0.02).\nWhich form of \nperitoneal dialysis?\nPeritonitis\nA\nB\nA1\nA1\nB1\nB1\nCAPD\nCCPD\nNo peritonitis\nDrop-out\nNot drop-out\nDrop-out\nNot drop-out\nPeritonitis\nNo peritonitis\nDrop-out\nNot drop-out\nDrop-out\nNot drop-out\nFIGURE 12  Decision model to compare the alternative forms of haemodialysis (n,decision node; l,chance node; ,terminal node)\ns\nsAppendix 8\n130\nResource use and costs\nThe principle cost differences between CCPD \nand CAPD result from differences in the costs \nof the two processes of dialysis and the costs of\ntreatment for complications.\nResources used before and during the \ndialysis session\nIt has been assumed that the resources used and\nthe costs of the initial insertion of the catheter and\nof training the patient to use the designated mode\nof peritoneal dialysis are the same for both CCPD\nand CAPD.\nCost of peritoneal dialysis\nThe costs per patient per year for both CAPD \nand CCPD are shown in Table 36. They include \nthe capital outlay and the consumables used in the\ndialysis process. The cost of routine outpatient visits\nhas not been included as these have been assumed\nto be the same for patients treated by either method.\nThe costs are made up from the cost of the consum-\nables used, for example, the dialysates and equip-\nment required for exchanges, and the capital cost\nof the cycler for CCPD. The current purchase price\nof all equipment was obtained from the manufac-\nturers and converted into an equivalent annual cost\nusing a 6% discount rate and assuming a life-span of\n3 years. All exchanges are assumed to be performed\nby the patient or the patient\u2019s carer. The time that\nthe patient or their carer spends in performing\nexchanges has not been estimated but is likely to\ndiffer between the two treatment modalities.\nCost of complications\nThe evidence presented above suggests that only\nthe rates of peritonitis and number of hospital\nadmissions per patient per year are significantly\ndifferent. The rates of drop-out and the reasons \nfor drop-out for both treatment modalities are not\nsignificantly different (de Fijter, et al., 1994). The\ncost per episode of both hospitalisation and peri-\ntonitis are shown in Table 37, and the probabilities\nthat such a complication will occur are shown in\nTable 38.\nBased on the model depicted in Figure 12, the \ndata included in Tables 36\u201338 can be used to\ncalculate the relative cost per patient of using\nCCPD or CAPD for the duration that a patient \ncan be expected to be on each treatment modality.\nCosts incurred after the initial year on dialysis are\ndiscounted at an annual rate of 6%.\nThe results using the model show that it would cost\non average \u00a322,670 to manage a patient on CCPD\nuntil treatment failure and it would cost \u00a317,000 to\nmanage a patient on CAPD until treatment failure\n(Table 39).\nTABLE 36  Relative costs of CCPD and CAPD\nExchanges Item of resource use Cost per item of CCPD CAPD\nresource use (\u00a3)\nCost per patient  Cost per patient \nper year (\u00a3) per year (\u00a3)\nCapital Cycler 7800 2918 N\/A\nConsumables  Tubing set (reusable as drainage bag) 12.5 4563 N\/A\nY connector 2.1 3066 3066\nNightly exchanges 16 5840 N\/A\nDaily exchanges                                      3.5 or 5.3 1277 7738\nCap 0.45 164 657\nShield 0.45 657\nLabour Time spent performing exchanges not estimated\nTotal 17,828 12,118\nN\/A,not applicable\nTABLE 37  Cost per episode of peritonitis and hospitalisation\nCondition Item of resource use Cost per \nepisode \n(\u00a3)\nPeritonitis 10-day course of antibiotics:\nVancomycin (10 vials 250 mg \nplus 2 \u00b4 500 mg injection) 65\nSerum concentration \n(one per day) 300\nSyringe 12\nTotal 377\nHospitalisation 10 days per year 1993Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n131\nCombining costs and benefits\nThe combination of the information on the \nrelative effectiveness and cost of CCPD and CAPD\ncan provide information on their relative efficien-\ncies. The available information on benefits suggests\nthat CCPD provides more benefits to patients than\nCAPD but at greater cost. (Area C1 on the frame-\nwork described in Figure 3). Here a judgement is\nrequired about whether the extra benefits are\nworth this additional cost, which requires consider-\nation of the opportunity cost of providing CCPD\ninstead of CAPD. (An opportunity cost is defined \nin terms of the benefits that could have been\nobtained if the resources were used in their \nnext best alternative use.) The consequence \nof using limited resources in one way is that \nthe opportunities to use them in other desirable\nways are given up.  The cost of that decision is the\nbenefit that could have been obtained by using \nthe resources in other desirable ways.\nThe RCT identified in this systematic review \n(de Fijter, et al., 1994) can be used to provide\nadditional information to aid in the judgement\nbetween CCPD and CAPD. Using data from the\nRCT on the rate per patient of technique failure,\nperitonitis and hospitalisation, the average inci-\ndence per patient of peritonitis and hospitalisation\ncan be calculated; the peritonitis and hospitalis-\nation rates per patient are shown in Table 40.\nUsing the data on the additional cost of CCPD\nrelative to CAPD (Table 38) and the additional bene-\nfits of CCPD (Table 40), it is possible to calculate the\nadditional cost per patient per case of peritonitis \nor hospitalisation avoided with CCPD relative to\nCAPD. As shown in Table 41, CCPD prevents an\nadditional case of peritonitis per patient relative \nto CAPD at a cost of \u00a320,100 or CCPD prevents \nan additional case of hospitalisation per patient \nat a cost of \u00a311,570. The issue is whether the extra\nTABLE 38  The probabilities of different events for CAPD and CCPD\nProbabilities per year Note\nCCPD CAPD\nTraining 1 1 Not included\nCatheter insertion 1 1 Not included\nCatheter removal 0 0 Not included\nHospital admissions per year 0.6 1 de Fijter,et al.,1994\nPeritonitis 0.51 0.94 de  Fijter,et al.,1994\nDrop-out (first year) 0.73 0.73 de Fijter,et al.,1994\nDrop-out (subsequent) 0.4 0.4 de Fijter,et al.,1994\nTransfer to CAPD from CCPD 0 Simplification\nTransfer to CCPD from CAPD 0 Simplification\nTABLE 39  Relative cost of CCPD and CAPD per patient up to\ntechnique failure\nModality Cost per  Extra cost per  Average \npatient  patient of  period before \n(\u00a3) CCPD over  technique \nCAPD (\u00a3) failure (years)\nCCPD 22,670 5670 1.22\nCAPD 17,000 \u2013 1.22\nTABLE 40  Peritonitis and hospitalisation rates per patient up to technique failure\nModality  Peritonitis rates  Additional rate of  Hospitalisation Additional rate of \nper patient  peritonitis of CAPD over  hospitalisation of CAPD \nCCPD per patient over CCPD per patient\nCCPD 0.62 0 0.73 0\nCAPD 0.89 0.27 1.22 0.49Appendix 8\n132\nbenefits of a case of peritonitis or the avoidance \nof an episode of hospitalisation are worth the\nadditional cost, given that the additional resources\ncould be used to achieve benefit elsewhere.\nDiscussion\nThe only study identified which met the eligibility\nfor inclusion criteria (de Fijter, et al., 1994) demon-\nstrated significant reductions in episodes of peri-\ntonitis and hospital admissions per patient-year\nwith CCPD compared with CAPD, and no publish-\ned economic evaluations were found on this study\nquestion. There were, however, no differences in\nother infective complications, technique survival,\nmechanical complications, dialysis adequacy, blood\npressure control, nutritional status, general well-\nbeing or mortality. Because it was a parallel study\nand all patients were new to dialysis when it started,\npatient preference was not reported.\nThe study shows that the modest additional\nbenefits of CCPD of over CAPD are achieved at\nmuch greater cost. The question is whether these\nmodest clinical benefits and unmeasured benefits,\nsuch as patient preference, are worth these extra\nresources. It is unlikely that these modest benefits\nwould support a general change to CCPD, given\nthat the extra resources are likely to provide much\ngreater benefit if used elsewhere.\nThe strength and generalisability of this review is\nobviously hampered by its dependence on a single\nstudy. This was a single centre study and, although\n97 patients were randomised, the predictable attri-\ntion rate from drop-outs resulted in there being\nonly 24 patients at the final 24-month review. The\nincidence of many of the complications and the\ntechnique failure recorded did not significantly\ndiffer between treatments. This may have been\nbecause there was no difference or it may have\nbeen because the study was too small to detect\ndifferences. Further studies, preferably multicentre\nstudies, are needed to confirm and statistically\nstrengthen the comparability of CCPD and CAPD\nindicated by this study. Peritonitis is the most fre-\nquent major complication of all forms of peritoneal\ndialysis. It can result in significant morbidity, mor-\ntality and dialysis technique failure. If future studies\nconfirm a significant reduction in its frequency\nwith CCPD, the extra benefits may outweigh the\nextra cost.\nIn this economic evaluation, costs are derived from\nestimates of resource use and probabilities which\nare directly taken from studies conducted in differ-\nent settings; hence, the results may not be general-\nisable. The quantity of resources consumed in any\ngiven setting is influenced by their prices, and\nprices can, and do, vary between settings.\nAlso, the total costs of treatment with CCPD \nor CAPD have not been calculated. Only those\nareas in which there are differences in resource\nutilisation have been investigated. Assumptions\nhave been made about the aspects of care that \nare the same for both modalities of treatment. \nFor example, it has been assumed that the same\nprocess of care was followed for the insertion of \nthe peritoneal catheter for both treatments.\nIn this situation there is no reason to believe that\nthe process of care would be different and, hence,\nthe assumptions that the resources used and the\noutcomes of insertion are the same are probably\nvalid. Patients require training for peritoneal\ndialysis and this has also been assumed to be the\nsame. In reality, patients on CCPD are likely to\nrequire training in both techniques (in case of\nemergencies), which patients solely on CAPD do\nnot. However, the duration of training is unlikely \nto differ. The cost of training CCPD patients is\nlikely to be slightly greater than CAPD patients \nand, other things being equal, this would tend to\nreduce the efficiency of CCPD relative to CAPD.\nFuture RCTs on this topic should concentrate \non primary outcomes of major clinical importance\nsuch as peritonitis, technique failure, mortality and,\nalso, strength of patient preference. The evaluation\nof strength of patient preference for a particular\nmodality may highlight significant benefits of\ntreatment not elicited through primary outcomes.\nCCPD should not be viewed solely as an alternative\nto CAPD. Although more expensive than CAPD \nit may have less resource demands than hospital\nhaemodialysis and may be a viable alternative \nTABLE 41  Additional cost per patient on CCPD of hospitalisation\nor episodes of peritonitis avoided\n1 Additional cost of CCPD over CAPD \u00a35670\n2 Number of cases of peritonitis avoided \nper patient on CCPD relative to CAPD 0.27\n3 Extra cost per patient per case of \nperitonitis avoided (Row 1\/ Row 2) \u00a321,000\n4 Number of episodes of hospitalisation \navoided per patient on CCPD relative \nto CAPD 0.49\n5 Extra cost per patient per episode of \nhospitalisation avoided (Row 1\/ Row 4) \u00a311,570Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n133\nwhen there is a relative contraindication to \nCAPD (for example, when significant input \nfrom a partner or assistant is required).\nConclusions and implications\nPolicy implications\nCCPD is a comparable alternative to CAPD in terms\nof patient outcome but is more expensive.

Further RCTs are required in which CCPD \nis compared with CAPD with particular refer-\nence to peritonitis, technique failure rates \nand patient preference. If these confirm the\nreduced peritonitis rate of CCPD, it may need\nto be considered as the preferred chronic\nperitoneal dialysis option.\n2. The more widespread use of CCPD may have\nsignificant resource-use implications. Future\nRCTs should include a thorough economic\nevaluation to provide more information on\nwhether any additional benefits are worth the\nadditional resources that CCPD, relative to\nCAPD, may require.\nRCTs and economic evaluations are required \nthat compare CCPD with haemodialysis to deter-\nmine whether it is efficient to provide CCPD for\nthose patients who have a relative contraindication\nto CAPD and would otherwise be treated \nby haemodialysis.\nReferences\nStudies included in the review\nde Fijter CWH, Oe LP, Nauta JJP, van der Meulen J,\nVerbrugh HA, Verhoef J, et al., 1994.

A renal transplant\nis normally considered to be the preferred choice\nbut there are insufficient donors to meet the\ndemand. Therefore, for those patients for whom\ntransplants are unavailable or who are not suitable\nfor transplantation, a decision has to be made on\nwhich mode of dialysis should be used.\nThe objective of this review was to ascertain if \nthere is clear evidence for the increased effective-\nness of haemodialysis compared with CAPD for all\npatients with ESRD or for a particular sub-group.\nAnother objective was to ascertain the relative costs\nof haemodialysis and CAPD, and to combine this\ninformation with the information on effectiveness\nto determine which method is the more efficient. \nThe review is described in detail in chapter 2. In\naddition, a systematic review of economic aspects\nwas undertaken to identify formal economic\nevaluations that had tried to assess the relative\nefficiency of CAPD and haemodialysis.\nHowever, as no RCTs were identified that compared\nCAPD with haemodialysis, only the review of\neconomic evaluations was possible.\nEconomic evaluation\nIntroduction\nThe principles of economic evaluation are\ndescribed in detail in chapter 3 (page 9) including,\nin an economic framework, the manner in which\ncosts and outcome are related (see, in particular,\nTable 2 and Figure 3).\nMethods\nSearch for data on efficiency\nThe methods of data extraction and analysis \nused are described in detail in chapter 3 of the\nmain report.\nThe following data were extracted from the\neconomic evaluations identified; author, title, \nyear of study, study question, country and setting,\nstudy design of main data source, methodological\nquality, (e.g. blinding, intention-to-treat) of the\nmain data source, sample size, measures used \nand main findings.\nResults\nIdentification of data on resource use and cost\nThe systematic literature search for studies that\nreported data on resource use for haemodialysis\nand compared CAPD was intended to identify the\ncosts of the relative resource use of these two\nmodes of treatment. The intention was that this\ninformation would be combined with data on\nbenefits obtained from the systematic review of\nRCTs. However, since no RCTs were identified \nthis was not possible.\nIt was possible, however, to systematically identify\nreports of economic evaluations that approxi-\nmately matched the study question. Studies that \ndid not include at least a comparison of CAPD \nand haemodialysis were excluded. Economic\nevaluation involves the formal analysis of the costs\n(resources use) and effectiveness (health effects) \nof two or more courses of action. Hence studies\nthat only analysed the cost of these two modalities\nwere excluded because they did not contain \na formal description of the relative benefits of \nCAPD or haemodialysis or implicitly assumed the\nbenefits of the two treatments were equal. When\ninformation on relative costs are not combined\nwith benefits then there is insufficient evidence \nto assess the relative worth of alternative inter-\nventions under investigation. This situation is\ndepicted by row \u2018D\u2019 in Figure 3 (page 10), \nwhere the question marks indicate there is\ninsufficient evidence.\nFor the same reason, studies of the costs of illness\nin which the global costs of the treatment of ESRD\nwere reported were also excluded because they \ndid not provide information on patient costs \nand do not report information on the relative\nAppendix 9\nSystematic review 6:Comparison of \nhaemodialysis with CAPD as treatment for \npatients with ESRDAppendix 9\n136\neffectiveness of CAPD and haemodialysis. A total \nof seven evaluations were identified (Tajima, et al.,\n1987; Churchill, et al., 1984; Croxson & Ashton,\n1990; Karlberg & Nyberg, 1995; Sesso, et al., 1990;\nHuraib, et al., 1990; Smith, et al., 1989); a summary\nof these articles is presented in Table 42.\nAll except two of the studies (Karlberg & Nyberg,\n1995; Smith, et al., 1989) were based on retro-\nspective unmatched cohort studies. Two studies\naddressed the efficiency of CAPD relative to\nhospital haemodialysis, (Karlberg & Nyberg, 1995;\nHuraib, et al., 1990), two also looked at renal\ntransplantation (Tajima, et al., 1987; Sesso, et al.,\n1990), two included both home haemodialysis and\nrenal transplantation (Croxson & Ashton, 1990;\nKarlberg & Nyberg, 1995), and one looked at\nCAPD, hospital haemodialysis, home haemodialysis\nand subsidiary unit haemodialysis (Smith, et al.,\n1989).The results are summarised in Table 43.\nSo far the work of Tajima and colleagues (1987)\nhas been considered in abstract form only because\nthe main text is in Japanese and is not yet available\nin translation. This study, based on a retrospective\ncohort of 27 patients, reported that renal trans-\nplantation was cheaper than CAPD which, in turn,\nwas cheaper than hospital haemodialysis. Limited\ninformation on benefits was given in the abstract,\nreporting only that the quality of life of patients\nwith transplants was better than the quality of life \nof patients on hospital haemodialysis. No infor-\nmation was provided in the abstract on the quality\nof life of patients receiving CAPD relative to\nhospital haemodialysis.\nChurchill and colleagues\u2019 (1984) paper is based\nupon a retrospective cohort design comparing\nCAPD and hospital haemodialysis. This type of\nstudy design does not control for potential biases \nin patient selection. Separate data are not reported\non costs but the number of life-years gained was\nreported to be greater for hospital haemodialysis\nthan for CAPD (see Table 43). The study reported\nthat the cost per life-year gained of CAPD versus \nno treatment was Canadian $33,400 and of hospital\nhaemodialysis was Canadian $48,700 in the finan-\ncial year 1980\/81. The cost estimates used in this\nstudy are mostly based on fees and it is unclear how\nwell these correspond to the economic or oppor-\ntunity cost of providing these treatments. A further\nissue is that the calculation of costs and benefits is\nbased solely on data for the 32 patients on hospital\nhaemodialysis and 12 patients on CAPD for\n1980\/81. This is a small sample and the limited\nfollow-up for this chronic condition means that\nimportant information may be missed.

The costs per\npatient per year of treatment were greatest for\nhospital haemodialysis, followed by home haemo-\ndialysis, renal transplantation and, finally, CAPD.\nThe study reported that the benefits to patients,\ncalculated from the Markov model based on the\nretrospective cohort study, was greatest for renal\ntransplantation, followed by, in descending order,\nhome haemodialysis, hospital haemodialysis and\nCAPD (see Table 43). The cost per life-year gained\nrelative to no treatment was least for renal trans-\nplantation, followed by, in ascending order, CAPD,\nhome haemodialysis and hospital haemodialysis.\nThe methodology used to conduct the economic\nevaluation was robust, since the Markov process\napproach allowed the transfer of patients between\nmodalities and allowed the modelling of patient\nsurvival using the data from the cohort study.\nHowever, it only considered costs and benefits \nfor 5 years. The authors also emphasised that \nthere may be considerable selection bias due \nto the non-randomised nature of the study.\nThe study by Karlberg and Nyberg (1995)\ncompared hospital haemodialysis, outpatient\nhaemodialysis (haemodialysis under minimal super-\nvision but still within the same hospital setting),\nCAPD and renal transplantation. The study pur-\nports to be a cost-effectiveness analysis. However, \nit explicitly assumes that survival is the same for \nall patients and does not consider differences in\nquality of life. The study is also based on unmatch-\ned cohort data and thus there may be substantial\nselection biases. The study reported that the costs\nper year was least for renal transplantation, then\nCAPD, followed by outpatient haemodialysis and\nhospital haemodialysis, respectively.\nSesso and colleagues (1990) from Brazil compared\nCAPD, hospital haemodialysis and renal transplant-\nation. The benefits of treatment per patient were\nreported to be greatest for hospital haemodialysis,\nfollowed by CAPD and, finally, transplantation. \nThe costs of treatment per patient were reported \nto be greatest for CAPD, then hospital haemo-\ndialysis and least for renal transplantation (see\nTable 43). It also found that the cost per life-year\ngained was least for renal transplantation, then\nhospital haemodialysis then CAPD. This study was\nbased on a retrospective cohort of patients but did\nnot allow for patients switching between modalities.\nThe cost-effectiveness of hospital haemodialysis \nwas heavily influenced by the low wage rates of \nstaff and the re-use of membranes. When correc-\ntion is made for the re-use of consumables for\nhaemodialysis, it becomes more expensive per \nlife-year than CAPD.\nHuraib and colleagues (1990) from Saudi \nArabia compared CAPD and hospital haemo-\ndialysis. Approximately the same percentage of\npatients in both arms of the study died during the\nstudy period (13% of haemodialysis patients and\n11% of CAPD patients). Of the patients initially\ntreated by CAPD, 43% transferred to another\nmodality of dialysis and patients treated with CAPD\nspent more time in hospital for dialysis-related\nreasons (e.g. access problems, peritonitis, fluid\noverload) than did patients treated with haemo-\ndialysis. CAPD was associated with a reduction in\nthe number of required transfusions and thus a\nreduction in the chance of transfusion related\ncomplications, such as hepatitis. The introduction\nof recombinant human EPO to correct the anaemia\nsuffered by haemodialysis patients has reduced the\nrequirements for blood transfusions in haemo-\ndialysis patients. Thus the benefits of CAPD are no\nlonger relevant in this respect. No attempt was\nmade to combine the alternative measures of\neffectiveness and so no explicit judgement was\nmade as to whether haemodialysis was more\neffective than CAPD. The study also reported that\nCAPD was cheaper than haemodialysis; however,\nthe costing methodology was not described and \nit is unclear what costs were included and whether\nthe costing methodology made allowance of the\nability of patients to switch between modalities.\nFurthermore, the study was based on a retro-\nspective cohort of patients and there was differ-\nential follow-up of patients in the two groups\n(haemodialysis patients were followed up for a\nmean of 21 months and CAPD patients were\nfollowed up for a mean of 15 months).\nThe report to the Welsh Office by Smith and\ncolleagues (1989) compared hospital haemo-\ndialysis, home haemodialysis, CAPD and haemo-\ndialysis at \u2018subsidiary\u2019 centres. This study explicitly\nassumed that survival was the same for all modal-\nities. It found, however, using the Rosser matrix\n(Kind, et al., 1982) \u2013 a method used to measure\nquality of life \u2013 that the quality of life of patients \nwas greatest for patients treated by CAPD or home\nhaemodialysis followed by, in descending order,\nhaemodialysis at a subsidiary unit and hospital\nhaemodialysis. The costs of treatment were least \nfor CAPD and, in ascending order, home haemo-\ndialysis, haemodialysis at a subsidiary unit and\nhospital haemodialysis. The cost per quality\nadjusted life-year was least for CAPD, followed by,\nin ascending order, home haemodialysis, haemo-\ndialysis at a subsidiary unit and hospital haemo-\ndialysis. The study was based upon a prospective\nmatched cohort of patients, where patients were\nmatched for age, sex and risk factors. However, Health Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n139\nthe study did not allow the switching of patients\nbetween modalities and 100% 5-year survival was\nassumed. The Rosser matrix, used to assess quality\nof life, has also been criticised as not being a valid\nmeasure of this factor (Loomes & McKenzie, 1989).\nThese studies report that CAPD provides less\nbenefit to patients but at less cost than hospital\nhaemodialysis (see Table 43). However, in terms of\nthe framework described in Figure 3 (page 10), a\npolicy of starting on haemodialysis relative to one\nof starting on CAPD is described by area D4, since\nthere are no reliable estimates of effectiveness and\npoor estimates of cost (as the costs of treatment are\npartly determined by survival, the probability of\nswitching modality and the probability that compli-\ncations will occur which are also measures of effec-\ntiveness). If the assumption is made that the avail-\nable evidence is valid then, in terms of Figure 3, a\npolicy of starting on haemodialysis relative to one\nof starting on CAPD is described by area A3. Here \na judgement is required as to whether the more\nexpensive treatment (hospital haemodialysis) is\nworth the extra benefit that it appears to provide.\nSome estimate can be obtained by looking at the\nratios of cost-effectiveness for the two methods of\ntreatment. The average cost per life year saved of\nCAPD is lower than that for hospital haemodialysis,\nas can be seen from the last column of Table 43.\nThis suggests that that CAPD uses less resources\nthan hospital haemodialysis to obtain a given\noutput, such as a life-year saved. Additional infor-\nmation can be obtained by looking at the incre-\nmental cost per life-year saved for haemodialysis\nrelative to CAPD. The incremental cost per life-\nyear saved of haemodialysis is the ratio of the extra\ncost of haemodialysis over CAPD divided by the\nextra life expectancy of haemodialysis over CAPD.\nUsing data from Croxson and Ashton (1990) \u2013 the\nstrongest paper in terms of its economic method-\nology because of its approach to modelling the\ncosts and benefits of the modalities under consider-\nation \u2013 the extra cost per extra life-year saved on\nhaemodialysis relative to CAPD (the incremental\ncost per life-year of haemodialysis relative to CAPD)\nis NZ $76,270. The comparison of this result to the\naverage cost per life-year saved shows that the cost\nof additional years of life saved by haemodialysis is\n2.9 times the cost of the life-year saved by CAPD\nrelative to no treatment (NZ $26,390 per life-year).\nThis relative difference would persist if the costs\nwere converted into pounds and corrected \nfor inflation.\nDiscussion\nAs no randomised controlled comparisons \nof haemodialysis with CAPD were found, we\nconcentrated on finding reports of economic\nevaluations, recognising that these would incor-\nporate assumptions about the relative clinical\neffectiveness of the two modalities which may \nbe unreliable.\nIn the event, only seven economic evaluations \nwere identified that attempted to answer the study\nquestion. The synthesis of these results, with the\ncaveats alluded to above, suggest that CAPD may be\nmore efficient than hospital haemodialysis despite\nassuming that it is less effective than haemodialysis.\nThere are reasons for treating this conclusion \nwith caution. The evaluations were conducted in a\nvariety of different countries and their applicability\nto the UK situation may, therefore, be limited. \nThis is a consequence of local variations in clinical\npractice, differences in the characteristics of the\nsamples used and differences in the unit costs of\nfactor inputs. In the study by Sesso and colleagues\n(1990), for example, the cost of haemodialysis was\nconsidered to be heavily influenced by the low cost \nof labour and the reuse of dialysers. While reuse \nof dialysers is possible elsewhere, the effect of this\non overall cost is uncertain and will depend upon\nthe sterilisation process used. The use of labour \nis an integral and major part of hospital haemo-\ndialysis, while comprising a comparatively minor\npart of CAPD costs; hence, these analyses are\nsensitive to variations in labour costs.\nAnother limitation is that, with the exception \nof the study by Karlberg & Nyberg (1995), all \nof the studies identified, were based on relatively\nsmall sample sizes and the largest study explicitly\nassumed that survival was the same for all treatment\nmodalities. This assumption does not correspond\nwith the data extracted from the four studies that\nreported survival (Churchill, et al., 1984; Croxon \n& Ashton, 1990; Sesso, et al., 1990; Huraib, \net al., 1990).\nThe relative cost-effectiveness \nof CAPD versus haemodialysis;\na Markov modelling approach\nSince there are no RCTs that investigate the \nrelative effectiveness of CAPD or haemodialysis,\nand since there are also very few economic evalu-\nations that seek to address the question of which\nmethod of dialysis is the most efficient, a more\nsophisticated economic evaluation was attempted\nto investigate the more appropriate modality on\nwhich a patient should initiate treatment. This\neconomic evaluation was based on an attempt Appendix 9\n140\nto identify systematically observational studies that\naddressed the study question.\nMethods of analysis\nThe analysis was based on a Markov model; this, \nin simple terms, describes possible patient pathways\nthrough a given process of card, in this case a\npatient\u2019s lifetime on dialysis, and can be used to\nestimate a patient\u2019s lifetime outcomes, such as sur-\nvival and cost. The Markov model was populated \nby data obtained from a systematic review of obser-\nvational studies (no RCT addressing this question\nhas ever been completed). It should be noted that\nperfect strategies to identify observational studies\ndo not currently exist. However, this method has\nthe potential to allow the best model to be made\nform the best evidence available.\nThe Markov model, shown in Figure 13, illustrates\nthe steps that a patient commencing treatment on\nhaemodialysis may go through. A similar model \ncan be defined for a CAPD patient.\nThe states of health that a patient may go through\nare denoted in each box. They were identified \nfrom the systematic review (Gokal, et al., 1987;\nCharytan, et al., 1986; Burton & Walls, 1989). An\narrow indicates that movement from one state to\nanother is possible. The movement between each\nstate is determined by a probability (obtained \nfrom the systematic review) of the patient either\nexperiencing a complication, remaining on\nhaemodialysis or dying.\nBecause of the limited data available for this model,\nit was not possible to model a patient who switched\nstraight to CAPD from haemodialysis without\nexperiencing a complication first. A patient also\ncannot spend more than 1 month in the state \nof complication.\nThe length of each cycle was defined as 1 month to\nmake the model more detailed, although a patient\ncan remain on haemodialysis, for example, for sev-\neral months without experiencing a complication\nor dying. The patient will continue \u2018travelling\u2019\nthrough this model until, eventually, the state \nof \u2018death\u2019 is reached.\nThe probabilities for moving between each \nstate of health were converted to matrix form for\nanalysis. The final analysis provided the length of\ntime a person commencing treatment on either\nCAPD or haemodialysis would spend in each state\nof health and, hence, the total expected survival \nof the patient.\nCosts were calculated in 1996\/97 pounds sterling\nfor each state of health within the Markov model.\nThey included all items of resource used (e.g.\nlabour, consumables, capital and overheads) \nand were based on local prices. For haemodialysis, \ncosts were based on the patient undergoing three\ndialysis sessions per week; for CAPD, costs were\nbased on four exchanges per day.\nCosts were built up from one dialysis session or\nexchange, then aggregated to a yearly cost and\ndivided by twelve to obtain the monthly cost. \nThe cost of access surgery was also calculated \nand added to the final cost. Costs and survivals \nwere not discounted as the Markov model does \nnot allow for this.\nSurvival of patients with ESRD\nLow and high estimates of survival of patients\ninitiating treatment either on CAPD or haemo-\ndialysis are shown in Table 44. The high prob-\nabilities refer to high probabilities of dying, having\na complication and switching modality. The low\nprobabilities refer to low probabilities of dying,\nhaving a complication and switching modality.\nCosts of patients with ESRD\nThe costs for each month were multiplied by the\nnumber of months spent in that state of health to\nobtain the cost of survival for each treatment modal-\nity (Table 44). The cost of each modality varies for\neach scenario but the initial modality of treatment \nis responsible for most of the cost incurred.\nCost-effectiveness\nThe ratios of extra cost to extra effectiveness of\nproviding haemodialysis in preference to CAPD \nare shown in Figure 14. These ratios were calculated\nComplication\nDeath\nHaemodialysis CAPD\nFIGURE 13  Markov modelHealth Technology Assessment 1998; Vol. 2: No.5\n141\nusing the data presented in Table 44. Haemodialysis\nis more effective and less costly than CAPD for\nthose comparisons where no ratio is presented.\nQuality of life\nThe impact of weighting survival by estimates of \nthe quality of life for each health state is shown \nin Table 45. Adjusting the actual survival by the\nquality-of-life weighting shows the expected period\nof full health that would be considered to be equal\nto the actual length of survival calculated by the\nmodel. For example, a weighting of 0.5 means that\neach month of survival predicted by the model is\nequivalent to 0.5 months of full health.\nDiscussion\nThe analysis provides differing results using\ndifferent assumption of costs and effectiveness. \nFor 11 of the 16 scenarios, haemodialysis would \nbe the treatment of choice as it provides greater\nsurvival time at a low cost than CAPD.\nThe ratio of extra cost of haemodialysis to its extra\neffectiveness for the other five scenarios varies\nbetween \u00a3396 and \u00a31596 per additional month \nof survival. To allow for the extra survival, however,\nadditional funding would be required. If extra\nfunds could not be obtained, resources would have\nto be obtained from elsewhere. The judgement\nabout whether to advocate haemodialysis over\nCAPD in such situations would depend on what\nbenefits could be obtained from the use of these\nextra resources elsewhere.\nThe weighting of survival by quality of life further\naffects the results of the analysis. This indicates \nthat the quality of life of patients while on dialysis \nis an important factor that should be taken into\nconsideration when deciding on the initial treat-\nment. The methodology used in this paper could, if\nbetter raw data were available, be used by clinicians\nto help to decide how best to treat their patients.\nAlthough the raw data used in this study is rela-\ntively poor, it is the best available. Given that judge-\nments have to be made on the best way of treating\npatients with ESRD, this model could be used by\npolicy-makers to judge resource allocation for\ntreatment of dialysis patients.\nTABLE 44  Survival and costs of treatment (rounded to \nnearest \u00a3)\nStarting treatment  Total cost  Survival \nmodality (\u00a3) (months)\nHaemodialysis 1 63,370 71.51\nHaemodialysis 2 73,797 78.94\nHaemodialysis 3 79,478 78.94\nHaemodialysis 4 68,267 71.51\nCAPD A 65,061 69.1\nCAPD B 67324 71.23\nCAPD C 76,426 71.23\nCAPD D 73,807 69.1\n1 \u2013 low costs with high probabilities;cost per month:\nhaemodialysis \u00a3868.43,haemodialysis complication \n\u00a3884.95,CAPD \u00a3905.19.CAPD complication \u00a31029.28.\n2 \u2013 low costs and low probabilities;cost per month:haemo- \ndialysis \u00a3868.43,haemodialysis complication \u00a3884.95,\nCAPD \u00a3905.19,CAPD complication \u00a31029.28.\n3 \u2013 high costs and low probabilities;cost per month:haemo-\ndialysis \u00a3923.03,haemodialysis complication \u00a31188.59,\nCAPD \u00a3905.19,CAPD complication \u00a31724.65.\n4 \u2013 high costs and high probabilities;cost per month:haemo- \ndialysis \u00a3923.03,haemodialysis complication \u00a31188.59,\nCAPD \u00a3905.19,CAPD complication \u00a31724.65.\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nRatio of costs to extra effectiveness (\u00a3\/month)\n1234\nHaemodialysis scenario\nA\nB\nD\nC\nFIGURE 14  Sensitivity analysis of extra cost of haemodialysis to its extra effectiveness relative to CAPD (.........,CAPDA;\u2013 \u2013 \u2013,CAPDB;\n\u2013\u2013\u2013,CAPDC;\u2013\u2013\u2013,CAPDD)Appendix 9\n142\nThe results presented here are based on the \nbest evidence available from a systematic review. \nIt should be noted, however, that there were only\nvery limited data available to construct the model.\nHence, the results of this study are of limited value\nin informing patient treatment modality. Future\nresearch should concentrate on examining the\nquality of life of patients on dialysis and on de-\nveloping studies which provide stronger data \non which a Markov model could be based.\nConclusions and implications\nThe issue facing the health services is not \nwhether to have CAPD or haemodialysis but \nrather the balance of provision between the two\nmodalities. It is known from variations in uptake \nof these techniques in different countries that a\nlarge proportion of patients requiring dialysis for\nESRD could be managed with either CAPD or\nhaemodialysis initially. What is required is infor-\nmation about the relative costs, benefits and risks \nof policies of starting with one or other treatment\nmodality. In this respect it should be possible \nto develop a more detailed model based upon\nobservational data. Ideally, information on bene-\nfits and risks should come from comparisons,\nwithin a pragmatic RCT, of policies based on\nstarting with CAPD or haemodialysis, as used \nin the UK.\nData are not available to allow reliable \nconclusions to be drawn about the relative\neffectiveness and efficiency of haemodialysis \nand CAPD.\nIf an assumption is made of equal effectiveness \nin terms of survival then the limited data available\nfavour CAPD.\nAlthough some studies have assumed that a policy\nof starting with haemodialysis is more effective than\na policy of starting with CAPD, it is not possible to\nquantify this extra benefit reliably using current\ndata and, hence, it is not possible to determine\nwhether haemodialysis is worth any extra cost that\nmay be incurred. This issue would be resolved most\nreliably by a pragmatic randomised trial that\nincluded a formal economic evaluation comparing\nthe two policies. Currently, Baxter Ltd are attempt-\ning to undertake a RCT in this area (Personal\ncommunication, 1998).\nThe implications of policies based on starting \nwith haemodialysis rather than on CAPD are more\ncomplex than described in previously reported\neconomic evaluations. \nThe development of new methods of dialysis, such\nas CCPD, and the advances in renal transplantation\ntechniques warrant additional evaluation to investi-\ngate their place in the treatment of ESRD alongside\nhaemodialysis and CAPD.\nReferences\nEconomics studies\nChurchill D, Lemon B, Torrance G, 1984.
