In\n2004, 30,000 acquisitions were completed globally, equivalent to one transaction every 18\nminutes. The total value of these acquisitions was $1,900 billion, exceeding the GDP of\nseveral large countries.\nHowever, in a paradox to their popularity, acquisitions appear to provide at best a\nmixed performance to the broad range of stakeholders involved. While target firm\nshareholders generally enjoy positive short-term returns, investors in bidding firms frequently\nexperience share price underperformance in the months following acquisition, with negligible\noverall wealth gains for portfolio holders (Agrawal and Jaffe, 2000). Internally managers of\nacquiring firms report that only 56% of their acquisitions can be considered successful\nagainst the original objectives set for them (Schoenberg, in press). Meanwhile, target firm\nexecutives experience considerable acculturative stress and, on average, almost 70% depart in\nthe five years following completion (Krug and Aguilera, 2005).\nThe complex phenomenon which mergers and acquisitions represent has attracted the\ninterest and research attention of a broad range of management disciplines encompassing the\nfinancial, strategic, behavioural, operational and cross-cultural aspects of this challenging and\nhigh risk activity. While in recent years research into the human and psychological aspects of\n1 The terms merger and acquisition are used interchangeably in this paper.\nM&A have increased in prominence, the M&A literature continues to be dominated by\nfinancial and market studies, with a high concentration of interest in the USA and UK\n(Cartwright, 2005).\nOur initial aim in compiling this Special Issue was to reflect the multi-disciplinary\nnature of M&A, consistent with the scope of the British Journal of Management, and to bring\ntogether a collection of high quality papers which captured a range of different perspectives\nand modes of inquiry. As we discuss below, M&A research has tended to develop along\ndiscipline-based lines and this has brought detailed insights into a number of important\naspects. However, it is arguable that this specialization has been at the cost of developing a\nmore holistic understanding of what determines their performance and what consequences\nthey bring.\nThe papers for this issue arose from two routes. A symposium linked to the Special\nIssue was held at the 2004 British Academy of Management Annual Conference in St\nAndrews. The symposium featured six contributions, selected for their diversity of\nperspectives and methodologies, which were subsequently entered into the review process for\nthis volume. These papers were supplemented by submissions made directly in response to\nthe Call for Papers that appeared in Volume 15 of the British Journal of Management.\nWe were extremely encouraged by the high level of submissions received, particularly\nthe number of papers emanating from mainland Europe and Australasia. In total 34\nsubmissions were received, representing 15 countries. Following a rigorous review process\ninvolving many of the leading scholars in the field, we are delighted with the contributions\nwhich form this issue. Our thanks go to the many reviewers who provided detailed,\nconstructive and timely comments on the manuscripts. We are also grateful to all the authors\nwho submitted their work and contributed to the quality of the Special Issue.\nThe final selection was difficult and was based on the individual quality of the\nsubmission, irrespective of the discipline from which it emanated. Consequently, there is a\nrather stronger focus on integration and integration process variables than the more traditional\nperspectives on M&A activity. This, we consider, is an encouraging reflection on the\nadvances in M&A research that are currently taking place.\nRecent Advances and Contributions\nAs M&A research has developed largely along disciplinary lines, finance scholars have\nprimarily focused on the issue of whether acquisitions are wealth creating or wealth reducing\nevents for shareholders. The weight of evidence shows that while takeovers unambiguously\nbring positive short-term returns for shareholders of target firms, the long-run benefit to\ninvestors in acquiring firms is more questionable. Agrawal and Jaffe\u2019s (2000) comprehensive\nreview of this literature suggests that in aggregate the abnormal returns accruing to acquiring\nfirms in the years following an acquisition are negative or, at best, not statistically different\nfrom zero. Importantly, these studies also highlight the wide variation in acquisition\nperformance at the firm level. Approximately 35-45% of acquirers do achieve positive\nreturns in the two to three year period following acquisition, with reported standard\ndeviations in the order of 10% around the mean return (e.g. Conn et al., 2001). The desire to\nunderstand the antecedents of this variance lies at the heart of much M&A research and is the\nsubject of the first article in this issue. In this article, Sudarsanam and Mahate (2006)\nconsider the mood of the bid and investigate the effect of bidder type i.e. friendly, hostile,\nwhite knight, multiple hostile, on the long-term performance of over 500 UK takeovers by\nexamining shareholder returns at various points over a three year period. Despite the negative\npress they tend to receive, the authors argue that their findings show that single hostile bids\ndeliver higher financial returns than friendly, white knight or multiple hostile bidders. The\npaper is also interesting in that it begins to straddle the traditional domains of finance and\nstrategic management by including in the analysis a number of firm specific variables relating\nto corporate governance structures and top management turnover.\nThe main focus of the strategic management research in the M&A field has been on\nthe identification of strategic and process factors that may explain the performance variance\nbetween individual acquisitions. The \u2018strategic fit\u2019 literature has been concerned with the link\nbetween performance and the strategic attributes of the combining firms, in particular the\nextent to which a target company\u2019s business should be related to that of the acquirer. While\nlittle consensus has emerged from this work (King et al., 2004; Seth, 1990), recent extensions\nto this perspective have provided detailed insights into value creation mechanisms within\nacquisitions based on resource sharing (e.g. Capron and Piste, 2002) and knowledge transfer\n(e.g. Ahuja and Katila, 2001). However, explanations of M&A underperformance cannot be\nsufficiently accounted for by the \u201cgoodness of the strategic fit\u201d alone without account being\ntaken of the wider integration process.\nThe \u2018process\u2019 literature focuses on the important role that the choice of integration\nstrategy and acquisition process itself can play. Both strategy and organizational behaviour\nscholars highlight that inappropriate decision-making, negotiation and integration processes\ncan lead to inferior acquisition outcomes. A key contribution of this approach has been the\nprovision of contingency frameworks for the form of post acquisition integration (Cartwright\nand Cooper, 1996; Haspeslagh and Jemison, 1991) and an understanding of how different\nintegration approaches may impact the ultimate outcome of a union (e.g. Child, Pitkethy and\nFaulkner, 1999; Schweiger and Very, 2003). Contemporary work from this perspective is\nalso developing our knowledge of how organizations can learn from their prior acquisition\nexperiences. Organizational learning appears to be mixed in the M&A context (Haleblian and\nFinkelstein, 1999) with the nature, variety and performance of prior experiences playing an\nimportant role (Hayward, 2002).\nAn emergent and growing field of enquiry has been directed at the cultural dynamics\nof M&As and the emotional and behavioural response of the employees involved. This\nliterature, with its diverse origins in the psychology, organizational behaviour and human\nresource management disciplines has sought to explain M&A underperformance in terms of\nthe cumulative dysfunctional impact the event itself, its associated uncertainty and the\nsubsequent process of integration have on individual organizational members.\nWithin this literature, poor culture-fit or lack of cultural compatibility have become\nmuch cited, if rather poorly defined, reasons for M&A failure. The relationship between\nculture and performance continues to intrigue and confuse researchers as studies examining\nthis link in relation to domestic and international M&As have produced rather mixed, and\noften contradictory results (Cartwright, 2005; Schoenberg, 2000). In their conceptual article\nTeerikangas and Very (2006) attempt to disentangle some of the issues which may shed light\non the current inconsistent research evidence and offer advice for future research, particularly\nthe importance of more longitudinal studies.\nAccording to Gertsen and Soderberg (1998), in M&A situations, the discourse around\ncultural differences is a vehicle by which employee groups assert the distinctiveness of their\nsocial identities. Such observations highlight the notion that M&As pose a potential threat to\nworkers\u2019 social as well as security needs and the valuable theoretical contribution which\nSocial Identity Theory (Tajfel and Turner, 1979) can make to our understanding of the\nmerger process. In recognition, this special issue includes two empirical research studies\n(Bartels et al., 2006; Van Dick et al., 2006), which investigate the potential antecedents of\npost-merger identification. These studies draw upon a growing body of research evidence\nwhich has shown in a variety of work contexts that high levels of employees\u2019 social\nidentification with the organization\u2019s identity result in increased work effort, higher\nperformance, reduced staff turnover and more frequent engagement in positive organizational\ncitizenship behaviours (Haslam and Ellemers, 2005).\nIn their study of a pending merger of two Dutch police organizations, Bartels et al.\n(2006) examine the contribution of a range of variables, including pre-merger identification,\nsense of continuity and perceived utility of the merger, in determining employees\u2019 expected\nlevel of post-merger identification. The study by Van Dick et al. (2006) retrospectively\nexamines the contribution of a fairly similar set of variables on post-merger identification on\nemployees involved in a German hospital merger. Although the data were collected at\ndifferent stages in the merger process, the results of both studies are consistent in\ndemonstrating that pre-merger identification is predictive of post-merger identification.\nInterestingly, this consistency challenges the prevalent notion of \u201chindsight bias\u201d that\nquestions the validity of retrospective data collection methods. Importantly, both studies have\nclear implications for practice in emphasizing the importance of communication to reinforce\nthe positive utility of the merger and to promote a sense of belonging.\nLongitudinal studies of M&As are still uncommon, primarily because it is difficult to\nmaintain representative sample sizes over time, particularly in circumstances when attrition\nrates are characteristically higher than usual. Therefore the authors of the next article are to\nbe congratulated on their persistence. Kavanagh and Ashkansay (2006) report on the findings\nof a cross-institutional study of three Australian university mergers conducted over a seven\nyear period. In a comparative study combining qualitative and quantitative methods, they\npresent data which reinforces the importance of leadership and the benefits of adopting an\nincremental approach to change.\nThus far, the contributions to this issue have been situated within UK, Europe and\nAustralasia, geographical areas with an established pattern of M&A activity. In contrast the\nfinal article, Cooke (2006), looks forward towards a new growth area for M&As, namely\nChina. In this article, she discusses the potential strategic and behavioural challenges of\nM&A in this region of the world and their implications for human resource management.\nThe future of M&A research and its contribution to knowledge and\npractice\nM&A research has now been ongoing for over 30 years, and while it has been possible to\nmention only a few of the varied contributions in the space available, each disciplinary\napproach has made significant advances in our understanding. Yet, despite this robust\nacademic interest, empirical data reveal that there has been little change in acquisition failure\nrates over the same time period. In his original work on European acquisitions, Kitching\n(1974) reported failure rates of 46-50 per cent, based on managers\u2019 self-reports. More\nrecently both Rostand (1994) and Schoenberg (in press) reported equally poor failure rates of\n44-45 per cent, using comparable methodology. An examination of the returns to acquiring\nfirm shareholders also reveals that acquisitions continue to produce negative average returns\nsimilar to those seen historically (Agrawal and Jaffe, 2000; Gregory, 1997).\nThree possible reasons might be advanced for this disturbing lack of improvement in\nM&A performance over the years:\n- executives are undertaking acquisitions driven by non-value maximizing motives\n- the prescriptions from the academic research have not reached the practitioner\ncommunity\n- the research to date is incomplete in some way.\nIt is true that some acquisitions are driven by non-value maximizing motives. For\nexample, Seth et al. (2000) investigated a sample of US international acquisitions and found\nthat 26 per cent were instigated by managers for their own utility rather than shareholder\ninterests. In addition, they established evidence of hubris, where managers mistakenly over-\nvalue their targets. However, their overall conclusion was that the majority of transactions are\nmotivated by value creation opportunities.\nThe second possible explanation, that practitioners are unaware of the insights\nprovided by M&A research, does not seem plausible. The majority of M&A researchers are\nalso active in the provision of management education and executive programmes.\nFurthermore, the risks of M&A activity have been highlighted by the financial press and\nthere is no shortage of insightful practitioner-orientated texts (e.g. Cartwright and Cooper,\n1996, 2001; Haspeslagh and Jemison, 1991).\nA third possibility is that our research remains incomplete in some way. A meta-\nanalysis of 93 prior empirical studies on the determinants of M&A performance by King et\nal. (2004), which incorporated the variables most frequently studied in the finance and\nstrategy literatures, concluded:\n\u201cour results indicate that post-acquisition performance is moderated by variables\nunspecified in existing research \u2026. An implication is that changes to both M&A\ntheory and research methods may be needed\u201d (King et al., 2004, p.188)\nA second meta-analysis, concerned with the impact of cultural differences on acquisition\nperformance, reaches similar conclusions in stating \u201ca huge portion of variance remains\nunexplained\u201d (Stahl and Voight, 2004, p. I4)\nInterestingly, both meta-analyses call for a greater recognition of the process and\norganizational dimensions of acquisitions, increasingly recognised in the behavioural\nliterature. Clearly there are substantial methodological bridges to cross to more closely link\nthe models of acquisition performance adopted in the finance and strategy literatures with the\nhuman and organizational insights from behavioural studies. The results of these meta-\nanalyses highlight that there is much ground for M&A research still to cover and reinforce\nthe timeliness of this Special Issue. We hope that it will serve as a catalyst for more inter-\ndisciplinary discussion and research on M&A.\nReferences\nAgrawal, A. and J.
