Contrasts in vertical mixing of nitrate between the shelf and the open \nocean correspond with horizontal and vertical changes in phytoplankton communities, with largest cells \nfound in surface waters at the shelf edge. Intense fishing activity is commonly seen at continental shelf \nedges, targeting spawning fish stocks. We suggest that the internal tide, a globally ubiquitous physical \nprocess at steep shelf edge bathymetry, supports shelf edge fisheries by providing large-celled \nphytoplankton for first-feeding fish larvae. The repeatability of the internal tide removes fish from the need \nto time spawning with a spring bloom. Also, with large phytoplankton cells dominating particulate organic \ncarbon export, the internal tides could be an important influence on spatial and temporal variability in \npatterns of global carbon sequestration in deep water and sediments. \n \n1. Introduction. \nThe size of phytoplankton cells plays an important role in determining how organic carbon is \ntransferred to higher trophic levels or is exported to deep water (Legendre and Rivkin, 2002). Communities \nmade up of small (< 5 \u00b5m) cells recycle carbon within the microbial food web, restricting the amount of \ncarbon available to larger organisms.  By contrast, large phytoplankton cells lead to greater downward \nexport of particulate organic carbon (POC) (Boyd and Newton, 1999; Legendre and Rivkin, 2002). Also they \nare more likely to be grazed directly by larger zooplankton, including fish larvae (Cushing, 1995), so \nincreasing the efficiency of energy transfer to higher trophic levels. \nPhytoplankton communities are generally dominated by small cells in nutrient-poor environments \n(Irwin et al., 2006), where small size provides an intrinsic advantage in nutrient uptake (Munk and Riley, \n1952; Chisholm, 1992). Larger cells are associated with nutrient-replete conditions, such as temperate spring \nblooms and upwelling regions (e.g. Pingree et al., 1976; Chavez et al., 1991), where the alleviation of \nnutrient stress removes the competitive advantage of being small. The edges of continental shelves are \nfrequently sites of internal tides and elevated vertical mixing (Baines, 1974) driving vertical nitrate fluxes \n(Sharples et al., 2001a; Sharples et al., 2007). They are also sites of high fish and fish larva densities \n(Genin, 2004), and are recognized as important contributors to the global carbon cycle (Walsh, 1991). Here \nwe show that vertical nitrate fluxes driven by an internal tide at the shelf edge of the Celtic Sea (Fig. 1) \nunderpin horizontal and vertical gradients in the phytoplankton community structure, providing a new \nexplanation for the distribution of fishing activity and having implications for the export of particulate \norganic carbon (POC).  \n \n2. Horizontal gradients in vertical turbulent mixing and nutrient fluxes. \nUsing a free-fall turbulent shear profiler during neap-tide and spring-tide 25-hour sampling periods \n(Sharples et al., 2007) at the shelf edge of the Celtic Sea (position CS2, Fig. 1) we have measured daily-\nmean vertical turbulent diffusivities of 1 \u2013 7 \u00d7  10-4 m2 s-1 at the base of the sub-surface chlorophyll layer. \nHigh spring tide diffusivities were driven by packets of internal solitons, with diffusivities reaching 3 \u00d7  10-3 \nm2 s-1. Further on the shelf (position OB, Fig. 1) daily-mean vertical diffusivities at the base of the \nchlorophyll layer were 2 \u2013 7 \u00d7  10-6 m2 s-1, similar to other values in stratified regions of the NW European \nshelf (Rippeth, 2005). Diffusivities within the thermocline of the open ocean are typically ~ 10-5 m2 s-1 \n(Lewis et al., 1986; Planas et al., 1999). \nThis mixing drives a vertical turbulent flux of nitrate into the base of the thermocline, where it fuels \nnew production. At station OB we observed a daily mean flux of 2 mmol m-2 d-1 into the thermocline, \nsimilar to other reports in the region (Sharples et al., 2001b). By contrast, estimates of mean daily nitrate \nfluxes into the sub-surface chlorophyll layer of the open Atlantic Ocean range between 0.05 \u2013 0.14 mmol m-\n2 d-1 (Lewis et al., 1986; Planas et al., 1999). At the Celtic Sea shelf edge nitrate fluxes at spring tides (up to \n 3 \n9 mmol m-2 d-1) are almost an order of magnitude greater than at neaps (1 \u2013 2 mmol m-2 d-1) (Sharples et al., \n2007). Measurements of primary production showed a factor 2 increase in carbon fixation rates at the shelf \nedge compared to the Celtic Sea and NE Atlantic, with single samples from the peak of the chlorophyll layer \nshowing larger-celled phytoplankton at the shelf edge (Sharples et al., 2007). \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. \nTypical early summer sea surface chlorophyll \nimage of seas around the UK and Ireland (MODIS \ncomposite 27th May \u2013 2nd June 2004). The dashed \nwhite line is the shelf edge (200 metre isobath), \nillustrating the correspondence with a band of \nhigh chlorophyll surface waters around much of \nthe UK and Irish shelf. The solid white line SW of \nthe UK was the transect used for the sampling in \nJuly 2005 (Fig. 2). Turbulent mixing and nitrate \nflux data from a 25-hour station are presented for \nstation OB; station CS2 is the shelf break position \nused for the measurements of Sharples et al., \n2007.

The phytoplankton response. \n We present here more detailed data on the phytoplankton community along the transect between the \nCeltic Sea and the open NE Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 1), showing marked vertical and horizontal gradients (Fig. \n2). The distribution of temperature and chlorophyll illustrates the localised nature of shelf edge mixing by \nthe internal tide (Fig. 2A). Despite the inference of the satellite chlorophyll imagery (Fig. 1) there was no \nclear shelf edge increase in the phytoplankton biomass integrated between the sea surface and 100 metres \n(Fig. 2B). However, the proportion of biomass in the larger size classes, including the diatoms, was higher at \nthe shelf edge with 60% of the phytoplankton biomass consisting of cells > 5 \u03bcm diameter (Fig. 2C). A more \ndramatic phytoplankton response to conditions at the shelf edge is illustrated by the distribution of different \nphytoplankton groups, based on flow cytometry. The prokaryotes Prochlorococcus (cells 0.5 \u2013 0.7 \u03bcm\ndiameter, Fig. 2D) and Synechococcus (0.8 \u2013 1.5 \u03bcm , Fig. 2E) dominated the thermocline of the NE \nAtlantic Ocean, with small numbers of autotrophic picoeukaryotes (2 \u2013 5 \u03bcm diameter, Fig. 2F) in the \nsurface layer. On the shelf the picoeukaryotes had a biomass maximum within the thermocline, with \nSynechococcus dominating the surface layer and almost no Prochlorococcus present. At the shelf edge there \nwas almost a complete absence of prokaryotes; instead the thermocline and surface waters were dominated \nby picoeukaryotes (Fig. 2F) and other larger phytoplankton (Fig. 2C). \nThese distinct horizontal contrasts in the vertical structure of phytoplankton correspond to the \ncontrasts in the supply of nitrate. The localised site of very strong vertical nitrate flux at the shelf edge \nshifted the phytoplankton community to one containing large cells, particularly close to the sea surface, with \n 4 \na marked near absence of prokaryotes. Intermediate nitrate fluxes into the thermocline on the shelf led to \nsmall eukaryotes in the thermocline, and Synechococcus residing in the upper layer where their smaller size \nmay be advantageous in the nitrate-deplete regeneration-dominated surface waters. Note that the \nphytoplankton community at the Celtic Sea end of this transect was representative of the community \nthroughout the rest of the stratified Celtic Sea, including station OB (Hickman et al., 2009). In the \noligotrophic open ocean, influenced by very low nitrate supplies, the cyanobacteria, particularly \nProchlorococcus, dominated the thermocline phytoplankton, as observed widely in the temperate NE \nAtlantic in summer (Tarran et al., 2001). \n \n \nFigure 2. \nDistributions of chlorophyll and phytoplankton along the transect marked in Fig. 1. \nA: Temperature (lines) and chlorophyll concentration (shaded) across the shelf edge (adapted from Sharples \net al., 2007). B: chlorophyll integrated through the upper 100 metres. C: the proportions of upper 100 m \nchlorophyll in the > 5\u03bcm size fraction, and the proportion of carbon within the diatoms in the open NE \nAtlantic, at the shelf edge, and in the Celtic Sea. D: the prokaryote Prochlorococcus. \nE: the prokaryote Synechococcus. F: picoeukaryotes. In A the sampling positions are marked by the vertical \ndotted lines, with adjacent positions being approximately 10 km apart. In C the fraction of chlorophyll \nbiomass in cells > 5 \u00b5m is based on size-fractionated filtering of water samples, and phytoplankton carbon \nwas estimated following (Poulton et al., 2007; Zubkov et al., 2000); error bars are \u00b1 1 s.d.. In D, E and F the \ndots show positions of water samples used for the flow cytometer analysis. \n \n4. Impacts on shelf edge fish and fishing. \n The shelf edge band of surface chlorophyll, indicating the site of internal tidal mixing, can often be \nseen stretching from northern Biscay, around the west of Ireland, and along the Malin shelf edge west of \nScotland (Fig. 1). We expect the patterns seen in Fig. 2 will be characteristic of this larger feature. The shelf \nedge is a site of high fishing vessel activity in the UK sector of the Celtic Sea (Fig. 3A), and further between \nthe Bay of Biscay and northern Scotland. Vessels target spawning stocks of mackerel, horse mackerel, hake, \nblue whitting and anchovies (Reid, 2001; ICES, 2007). Based on the distribution of eggs and larvae, the \nspawning habitat of these species is very tightly associated with the 200 metre isobath at the shelf edge \n(Ibaibarriaga et al., 2007). High fish concentrations along continental margins are often explained in terms \n 5 \nof a nutrient supply fuelling enhanced primary production, supporting high densities of physically-\naggregated zooplankton, ultimately providing more food for fish (Genin, 2004). While shelf edge primary \nproduction rates are higher (Sharples et al., 2007), analysis of data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder \nindicates that there is no response in standing stocks of components of the meso-zooplankton known to be \npart of larval diet (Fig. 3B, C, D). Fish larvae target particles >5 \u03bcm in size (Cushing, 1995) and data on \nmackerel larval gut contents at the Celtic Sea shelf edge shows first-feeding larvae to be ingesting \nphytoplankton (Conway et al., 1999). Rather than higher phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass or \nproduction, it would appear that the internal tide could be an underlying cause of the distribution of \nspawning fish via the impact of vertical turbulent mixing on the size structure of the phytoplankton \ncommunity.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. \nA: Annual average (2001-2007) of fishing vessel \nactivity in the UK sector of the Celtic Sea for the \nthermally-stratified period April \u2013 September, \nbased on analysis of Vessel Monitoring System \n(VMS) data provided by the UK Department for \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs. VMS \nposition data for all EU fishing vessels was used \nto calculate vessel speeds, with speeds < 4 knots \ntaken to imply fishing activity (e.g. Hiddink et al., \n2007). Boxes 0 \u2013 6 were used for the collation of \nplankton samples from the Continuous Plankton \nRecorder (CPR) for (B) copepod eggs, (C) \ncopepod nauplii, and (D) small copepods < 2mm \nlength. Monthly total counts in each box for the \nyears 1990-2006 were obtained from the Sir \nAlister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science \n(SAHFOS). The CPR data are illustrated in terms \nof their mean densities relative to the \nconcentration in box 3 (the shelf edge and upper \nslope). Error bars are 1 s.d.. Note that CPR \nsamples are taken from a nominal depth of 10 \nmetres. For non-motile or weakly motile meso-\nzooplankton components, in the strong vertical \nmixing at the shelf edge, this will not significantly \nimpact the interpretation of the CPR data. \n \n \nSimilarly, while the near-surface CPR data on small components of the meso-zooplankton did not show any \nshelf edge signal, overall zooplankton communities have been found to change at the shelf edge, though not \nas a response to changes in primary production rates (Albaina & Irigoien, 2004). This perhaps again \nimplicates the phytoplankton community in determining the environment for larger organisms. The internal \ntide operates with regular periodicity throughout the stratified season (typically April \u2013 September). As a \ncontrol on larval food the internal tide removes the fish from a need to time spawning with the annual spring \nbloom (Cushing, 1990; Platt et al., 2003), though species-specific constraints due to temperature and light \nwill still play roles in determining preferred spawning season. This proposed link between periodic (spring-\nneap) supply of nitrate, growth of larger phytoplankton cells, and feeding by fish larvae is comparable to the \n 6 \nobservations of Lasker, 1975, on the role of episodic wind mixing supporting sardine larvae off California. \nIn addition to food for first-feeding larvae the mixing and nitrate flux at the shelf edge could be aiding fish \nsurvival in other ways. The nutrient supply and subsequent large-celled phytoplankton could offer better \nquality food for fish larvae than a cyanobacteria-dominated community (Muller-Navarra et al., 2000). \nIncreased turbulent mixing at the shelf edge may also play a role in prey capture rates by fish larvae \n(Kiorboe and Saiz, 1995). \nInternal tidal mixing is a globally common process over shelf edges, seamounts, and other \ntopographic features. The frequent association of important fisheries over the same topography suggests that \nour observations of the impact of mixing on the phytoplankton community structure is an important, and so \nfar unreported, link between physical processes and ecosystem function. \n \n5. A role in particulate organic carbon (POC) export at the shelf edge. \nLarge celled phytoplankton are a major component of POC exported out of the photic zone \n(Legendre and Rivkin, 2002). The ocean margins are thought to be important sites of POC sequestration as \ncarbon can reach the sediments and be buried before being remineralised (Walsh, 1991). Based on satellite \nimagery of sea surface chlorophyll, margins have been estimated to be responsible for >40% of global \noceanic carbon sequestration (Muller-Karger et al., 2005). Our results suggest that the edges of continental \nshelves are not only sites of relatively high primary production, but also support a phytoplankton community \nof large cells more suited to export and sequestration of carbon. Our demonstration of phytoplankton cell \nsize being sensitive to gradients in physical mixing suggests that knowledge of baroclinic energy dissipation \nglobally (e.g. Nycander, 2005) could be a valuable component in explaining present-day community \nstructure and potential for POC export. On longer time scales the distribution of internal tides will alter as \nsea level changes between glacial and inter-glacial periods, or as the shape and length of margins changes \ndue to different continental configurations. These may be important considerations for long term changes in \nshelf edge ecosystems and global carbon sequestration. \n \nAcknowledgements. \nThis work was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, grant numbers \nNER\/A\/S\/2001\/00449, NER\/A\/S\/2001\/00961 and Oceans2025.
