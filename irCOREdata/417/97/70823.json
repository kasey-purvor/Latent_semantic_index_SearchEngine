Solving the equations\nnumerically, they found that the output SNR could exceed\nthe input SNR in the following cases: ~a! a single neuron\nforced by harmonic signal and coloured noise; ~b! a single\nneuron forced by pulse signal and colored noise; and ~c! a\nneural network forced by a common harmonic signal and\nindependent colored noise sources.\nIn this Comment we present arguments and numerical re-\nsults demonstrating that, for the same parameters as Ref. @1#,\nsuch SNR improvements do not occur for either case ~a! or\ncase ~b!.\nIn apparently demonstrating the possibility of an SNR en-\nhancement, Liu et al. @1# have relied on a spectral calculation\nof the input and output neuron signals, obtained through nu-\nmerical solution of the Langevin equations. Previous studies\n@2,3# of the stochastic resonance ~SR! effect have shown that\nnumerical calculations of input and output SNR values are\nvery readily prone to error. They have also demonstrated @2#\nthat, at least in the linear response limit, the SNR of a har-\nmonic signal cannot be enhanced by passage through a sto-\nchastic resonator.\nA noise-induced absolute enhancement of the SNR is\nthus, to say the least, unusual. There are only two known\ncases where it has been reliably established. One is the level\ncrossing detector ~LCD! trigger system @4#, and the other is\nfor the passage of a square wave through a Schmidt trigger\nsystem @5,6#. In each of these cases there are simple physical\narguments as to how the effect arises, and a mass of corrobo-\nratory evidence as to its reality. For the more complex\nHodgkin-Huxley system @1#, on the other hand, there are\nonly the numerical simulations. Methods of checking their\nvalidity are therefore much to be desired. One way of doing\nso is through consideration of the theoretical background ~al-\nthough rigorous theoretical arguments exist only for the spe-\ncific cases of the LCD-trigger @4# and a two-state system\nwith a static nonlinearity @7#!. Another obvious check is\nthrough independent numerical simulations. In what follows,\nwe adopt both of these approaches.\nWe first consider the occurrence of absolute SNR en-\nhancements in the Schmidt trigger, and note how the signa-\nture of this effect is exhibited in the hopping statistics. We1063-651X\/2003\/67~4!\/043901~6!\/$20.00 67 0439then model the Hodgkin-Huxley system to see if a similar\nsignature arises. We also simulate the full system and make\ndirect comparisons between the input and output SNR to see\nif the latter becomes larger that the former.\nIn Refs. @5,6#, SNR enhancement was investigated via an\nanalysis of the statistical characteristics of switching events\nbetween states. We now consider some of these results @6# in\nmore detail. We have examined the transmission of a peri-\nodic signal and colored noise through a Schmidt trigger on\nthe basis of an analog electronic experiment. We have con-\nsidered two types of periodic signals: harmonic signal and\nrectangular, which we will refer to as a pulse signal. To\navoid aliasing, the experimental data were filtered by low-\npass analog filters. The data were then digitized with an\nanalog-digital converter card in a computer, where they were\nthen used to calculate the power spectrum and to build a\nresidence time @8# and phase @9# distributions. The power\nFIG. 1. Experimental results for the Schmidt trigger. The differ-\nence G between the output and input SNR R is plotted as a function\nof noise intensity s for harmonic (s) and for pulse periodic (n)\nsignals. The threshold of the Schmidt trigger, Ut50.47 V; the am-\nplitude of the periodic signal is 0.41 V; the frequency of the peri-\nodic signal is 2p(400) Hz; and the cutoff frequency of the noise is\n100 kHz. The values of G and noise intensity s for which residence\ntime and phase distributions are shown in Figs. 2\u20134 are indicated\nby arrows.\u00a92003 The American Physical Society01-1\nCOMMENTS PHYSICAL REVIEW E 67, 043901 ~2003!spectrum was calculated by fast Fourier transform. The re-\nsults are presented in Figs. 1\u20133.\nIn Fig. 1 the difference between output and input SNR\n@10#, G5Ro2Ri , is plotted as a function of noise amplitude\ns for pulse and harmonic signals; note that G is equivalent to\nthe quantity gu in Ref. @1#. For the pulse signal there is an\ninterval of noise amplitude within which the output SNR Ro\nexceeds the input value Ri . The residence time and phase\ndistributions for different noise amplitudes ~see caption of\nFig. 1! are shown in Figs. 2,3. For the harmonic signal, the\nwidths of the phase distribution @Fig. 2~a!# and the residence\ntime distribution @Figs. 3~a!-3~c!# are increasing with noise\nintensity, and there is no improvement of SNR. For the pulse\nsignal, within the range of noise amplitude where output\nSNR exceeds the input value, the distribution widths @Figs.\n2~b! and 3~d!-3~f!# decrease with noise intensity. The resi-\ndence time distribution @Figs. 3~d!-3~f!# has peaks at mul-\ntiples of the signal period when an improvement in SNR\nexists. Thus, based on the behaviors of residence times and\nphase distributions, we can suggest an additional criterion for\nthe existence of a positive G: if there is SNR gain, then the\nresidence time distribution has one peak arising at multiples\nFIG. 2. Experimental results for the Schmidt trigger. Its phase\ndistributions p(w) are shown for ~a! harmonic and ~b! pulse peri-\nodic signals. The different lines correspond to the arrows in Fig. 1.\nThe thin full line corresponds to arrow 1, the dashed line to arrow 2,\nand the dash-dotted line to arrow 3. The values of phase w are\nnormalized by 2p . The bold full lines indicate the shape of signals.04390of the signal period, and the widths of both the residence\ntime and phase distribution decrease with increasing noise\nintensity. The conclusion is correct if we consider hopping\ndynamics only. This criterion can be applied to check the\nresults reported in Ref. @1#, which involved precisely this\nkind of dynamics.\nNote that, just as for the Schmidt trigger, we have ob-\nserved an association between an improvement in SNR and\nan evolution of the hopping statistic distribution for the LCD\ntrigger and an overdamped bistable oscillator forced by\nlarge, but subthreshold, pulses and noise. In all the cases the\nsystems are in the strongly nonlinear regime @2,3,5#, and the\nmechanism for improvement of the SNR consists of a non-\nlinear transformation of additive sum of pulse signal and\nnoise to qualitatively different hopping process. The positive\nG phenomenon depends crucially on the pulse shape, and it\nis not observed for harmonic subthreshold signals @5,6#.\nTo illustrate the truth of the latter statement, we consider\nthe influence of a shape of periodic signal on SNR for the\ncase of a Schmitt trigger driven by noise and the signal x(t)\nthat is generated by a Van der Pol self-oscillator,\ny~ t1h !5sgn@Uty~ t !2ax~ t !\/b2j~ t !# ,\nx\u00a8 2e~12x2!x\u02d9 1v0\n2x50. ~1!\nHere y(t1h) and y(t) are the Schmidt trigger outputs at\ntime moments (t1h) and t, respectively, h is the time step\nthat defines the trigger relaxation time, Ut50.1 is the trigger\nthreshold, j(t) is colored noise of intensity s , cutoff fre-\nquency f c5100, a is the amplitude ~maximum deviation\nfrom zero level! of the signal, x(t) is the Van der Pol oscil-\nlator output, b is its amplitude, e is the nonlinearity param-\neter of the oscillator, and v0 is the parameter that defines its\nnatural oscillation frequency. The parameter v0 is chosen to\nkeep the oscillation period equal to T52p . The shape of the\ngenerated signal x depends on e and approaches a rectangu-\nlar shape as e increases. To characterize the shape of the\nsignal x, we introduce the quality S:\nS5\nE\n0\nT\nux~ t !u\/b\nT .\nS is equal to 1 for a pulse signal and S51\/p\u20190.6366 for a\nharmonic signal.\nThe dependences of G on the noise amplitude s are dis-\nplayed in Fig. 4 for different values of e . It can be seen that\nfor the signal shapes that are harmonic, or close to harmonic,\nSNR improvement does not occur: G only increases above\nzero for larger values of e ~and for the pulse signal, shown\nfor comparison!; and SNR improvement takes place only for\ncertain shapes of signals, which are similar to the ~rectangu-\nlar! pulse signal shape.\nOf course, as the authors of Ref. @1# have correctly noted,\nthe Hodgkin-Huxley model is quite different from all the1-2\nCOMMENTS PHYSICAL REVIEW E 67, 043901 ~2003!FIG. 3.

The main difference is the presence in the Hodgkin-\nHuxley model of several time scales: the relaxation time to\nthe stable state, and scales which define the intra-well dy-\nnamics. This is in contrast to trigger systems and the over-\ndamped bistable oscillator, which are characterized only by a\nrelaxation time scale. Liu et al. @1# suggest that their results\n~i.e., the absolute enhancement of the SNR! may be attrib-\nuted to the presence of intrawell dynamics, in addition to\ninterwell dynamics. This suggestion is apparently inconsis-\ntent with the results of earlier investigations @11,12#, showing\nthat the SNR and amplification are both decreased by in-\ncreasing complexity of the intrawell dynamics.\nIn the context of earlier work, therefore, the results of\nRef. @1# for the Hodgkin-Huxley model must be regarded as\nquite unexpected, especially in cases ~a! and ~b!. We have\ntried to reproduce their results using the same parameters and\na different numerical scheme for integration of the Langevin\nequations. We have also chosen an integration time step that\nis four times smaller than in Ref. @1# ~for the same noise1-3\nCOMMENTS PHYSICAL REVIEW E 67, 043901 ~2003!correlation time!, in order to be confident that we have\navoided possible aliasing effects @13#. The numerical scheme\nhas been exhaustively tested and approved for use in a very\nwide range of problems @14#. In addition to the power spec-\ntrum, we have also calculated time statistical distributions of\nspikes ~switching between states! of the neuron.\nThe results of our numerical simulations are presented in\nFigs. 5\u20137. We used the same parameters as Liu et al. @1# @see\nthe caption of Fig. 1~a! in Ref. @1# for parameters of the\nharmonic signal, and the caption of Fig. 3 in Ref. @1# for\nparameters of the pulse signal#. We have calculated the SNR\nfor the full dynamics ~without transformation to a two-state\ndynamics! of the neuron voltage potential V(t), and also for\nthe spike dynamics of V(t), which was obtained by convert-\ning V(t) into a sequence of pulses with the same amplitude\nand duration as in Ref. @1#. Note that in Ref. @1#, only the last\ntype of dynamics was examined. It can be seen ~Fig. 5! that,\nfor both harmonic and pulse signals, the output SNRs behave\nlike those in Ref. @1# ~see Figs. 1~a! and 3 on Ref. @1#! only\nin the region of the maximum. For larger noise intensity D,\nthe output SNRs show quite different behaviors. The input\nSNRs are different for all the values of noise amplitude. In\nFIG. 5.

The values of R and noise in-\ntensity D for which residence time distributions and phase distribu-\ntions are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 are indicated by arrows.04390contrast to Ref. @1#, it is clear that the present data show no\nSNR improvement for either harmonic or pulse signals.\nThe form of the time statistical distributions ~Figs. 6 and\n7! again demonstrate the absence of a positive G. Indeed, the\nwidth of circle distributions increases with noise intensity\n~Fig. 6!, and the residence time distributions have several\npeaks separated by periods of the signal ~Fig. 7!.\nWe have not attempted to reproduce the results reported\n@1# for case ~c!. However, especially given that Liu et al.\nused the same numerical algorithm as for the single-neuron\ncases ~a! and ~b!, the results of case ~c! must be in question\nand deserve to be checked.\nIn summary, using the same parameters as the authors of\nRef. @1#, we can find no evidence to support the reported\nobservation of absolute SNR enhancements in the Hodgkin-\nHuxley model of a neuron. Finally, we stress the close con-\nnection that exists between SNR enhancements and hopping\nprocesses: statistical measures of hopping dynamics can be\nused to check the correctness of spectral calculations. Infor-\nmation flow in neuron dynamics can be characterized by sta-\ntistical measures of the hopping process, whereas the SNR\ncannot be used for this purpose @15#.\nFIG. 6.
