Sets of highly-elongated bedforms show that, at the last glacial maximum, the 19 \nroute of the Pine Island-Thwaites palaeo-ice stream arced north-northeast following a 20 \nprominent cross-shelf trough. In this area the grounding line advanced to within ~68 km of, 21 \nand probably reached, the shelf edge. Minimum ice-thickness is estimated at 715 m on the 22 \nouter shelf, and we estimate a minimum ice discharge of ~108 km\n3\n yr\n-1\n assuming velocities 23 \nsimilar to today\u2018s Pine Island glacier (~2.5 km yr-1).

The \u2017style\u2018 of ice-retreat is also 26 \nevident in five grounding zone wedges, which suggest episodic deglaciation characterised by 27 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n2 \n \nhalts in grounding-line migration up-trough.

Our findings show that the ice stream channelled a 32 \nsubstantial fraction of West Antarctica\u2018s discharge in the past, just as the Pine Island and 33 \nThwaites glaciers do today. 34 \n 35 \n3045 Seafloor morphology, geology, and geophysics 36 \n3002 Continental shelf and slope processes  37 \n1621 Cryospheric change  38 \n0730 Ice streams 39 \n 40 \n1. Introduction and background 41 \nPine Island and Thwaites glaciers account for most of the ice discharge from the Amundsen 42 \nSea drainage sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) (Fig. 1). They presently exhibit 43 \nthe most rapidly decreasing surface elevation within the WAIS [Shepherd et al., 2001; 44 \nPritchard et al., 2009], and increasing discharge over the past 35 years through flow 45 \nacceleration (Pine Island) and widening (Thwaites) indicates that this is dynamic thinning 46 \n[Rignot, 2006, 2008; Scott et al., 2009]. Grounding line retreat associated with this thinning 47 \nhas also been demonstrated for Pine Island Glacier [Rignot, 1998]. The dynamic thinning has 48 \nbeen widely attributed to intrusion of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water onto the 49 \ncontinental shelf, melting the bases of glacier tongues and ice shelves and reducing their 50 \n\u2015buttressing\u2016 effect [e.g., Jacobs et al., 1996; Rignot and Jacobs, 2002; Payne et al., 2004; 51 \nShepherd et al., 2004; Walker et al., 2007; Thoma et al., 2008]. Deep bathymetric cross-shelf 52 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n3 \n \ntroughs, which are thought to have been incised by glaciers through the Miocene-Quaternary 53 \n(Fig. 1) may be important for this process, channelling warm water towards the ice fronts. 54 \nEnhanced geothermal heat flux beneath the Amundsen Sea glacier catchments might be 55 \nanother driver of flow changes [Rignot et al., 2002], enhancing melting at the glacier beds 56 \nand thus increasing lubrication. Alternatively the recent imbalance may simply reflect a 57 \nshort-term deviation from the ice sheet\u2018s long-term retreat trajectory. In order to test this 58 \nhypothesis it is necessary to establish the maximum extent of ice during the last glaciation, 59 \nand the timing and pattern of its subsequent retreat. An important question is whether or not 60 \nthere may have been previous periods of rapid thinning and retreat interrupted by intervals 61 \nwhen the grounding line and flow stabilized. 62 \n 63 \nThis history of flow stability is particularly pertinent to the Amundsen Sea sector today 64 \nbecause the ice-bed currently lies below sea level beneath its main glacier trunks, and slopes 65 \ninland monotonically from the grounding line in the Thwaites catchment [Holt et al., 2006; 66 \nVaughan et al., 2006]. According to some theoretical studies this geometric configuration is 67 \none of the key criterion for a marine ice-sheet collapse [Vaughan and Arthern, 2007; Schoof, 68 \n2007] and has contributed to the Amundsen Sea sector often being referred to as \u2017the weak 69 \nunderbelly\u2018 of the WAIS [Hughes, 1981], with suggestions that the region may be prone to 70 \nfuture rapid deglaciation [Vaughan, 2008]. 71 \n   72 \nHowever, confidence in models that purport to simulate future changes in the ice sheet can 73 \nonly be established by verifying those models against past behaviour; in particular flow 74 \nhistory and changes since the last glacial maximum (LGM) at ~20 cal. kyrs before present 75 \n(BP) \u2013 here referring to the last period of regional maximum ice-sheet extent around 76 \nAntarctica [Anderson et al., 2002] when grounded ice had advanced onto the adjacent 77 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n4 \n \ncontinental shelf \u2013 and during the deglaciation between ~20-10 cal. kyrs BP [Anderson et al., 78 \n2002; Lowe and Anderson, 2002]. The most readily available and detailed information on the 79 \nformer footprint of these ice streams, and thus their flow history, comes from the 80 \nmorphological record preserved at the sea floor today [Shipp et al., 1999; Canals et al., 2000; 81 \nEvans et al., 2005; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005a, 2005b; Dowdeswell et al., 2008]. Previous studies 82 \nhave used the presence of geomorphic ice-flow indicators such as preserved streamlined 83 \nbedforms, to suggest that an ice stream flowed out of Pine Island Bay towards the continental 84 \nshelf edge in the past. Geophysical data and sediment cores from the large cross-shelf trough 85 \nthat extends offshore from Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers were interpreted by Lowe and 86 \nAnderson [2002, 2003] as showing that grounded ice had extended at least as far as the 87 \nmiddle shelf (as a minimum possible extent), and probably to the shelf edge at the LGM (as a 88 \nmaximum scenario). On the basis of radiocarbon dates on calcareous microfossils extracted 89 \nfrom cores, Lowe and Anderson [2002] concluded that ice subsequently retreated from the 90 \nmiddle shelf prior to ~16 \n14\nC ka BP (uncorrected) and retreated to the inner shelf by 10 \n14\nC ka 91 \nBP (uncorrected). Evans et al. [2006] presented multibeam data showing subglacial bedforms 92 \nthat extend to the shelf edge in an outer shelf trough at 114\u00b0W, and argued that their sea-floor 93 \nposition and the lack of overlying sediment drape indicate that the WAIS was grounded at the 94 \nshelf edge during the LGM. However, coverage of multibeam swath bathymetry data remains 95 \nsparse on large parts of the outer Amundsen Sea shelf, especially north of 72\u02da 30\u2018S, where the 96 \npath of the main Pine Island cross-shelf trough is less clear (Fig. 1) [Nitsche et al., 2007]. In 97 \naddition, only two radiocarbon dates constrain the \u2017timing\u2018 of post-LGM deglaciation and 98 \neven less information exists about the \u2017style\u2018 of ice retreat from the eastern Amundsen Sea 99 \nshelf [Lowe and Anderson, 2002], the latter of which constitutes a key parameter for 100 \nvalidating ice-sheet numerical simulations.  101 \n 102 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n5 \n \nIn this paper we describe streamlined subglacial bedforms that record the flow and retreat 103 \nstyle of a major palaeo-ice stream \u2013 the Pine Island-Thwaites palaeo-ice stream (PITIS) \u2013 104 \nacross the Amundsen Sea continental shelf. This ice stream received input from the ancestral 105 \nPine Island, Thwaites and Smith glacier systems (Fig. 1). The bedforms are located in a 106 \ntrough which extends to the shelf edge, at 106\u02daW (Fig. 1). Using new geophysical datasets we 107 \ntest the following hypotheses: (1) the LGM WAIS extended to the outer shelf in the eastern 108 \nAmundsen Sea; (2) the major drainage pathway and main outlet of the PITIS can be traced 109 \nfrom the present grounding line through the trough in the eastern Amundsen Sea Embayment 110 \n(ASE); and (3) sea-floor geomorphic evidence can be used to constrain the style and course 111 \nof grounding-line retreat to its present-day configuration. 112 \n2. Methods 113 \nWe used marine geophysical data acquired using a Kongsberg EM120 (191 beams at 11.25\u2013114 \n12.75 kHz) and an Atlas Hydrosweep DS-2 (59 beams at 15.5 kHz) multibeam swath 115 \nbathymetry system, together with TOPAS parametric sub-bottom profiles (\u2017burst\u2018 pulse at 116 \nsecondary frequency of 2.8 kHz and \u2017chirp\u2018 pulse with secondary frequencies of 1.5\u20135 kHz), 117 \nto map the topography and distribution of relict subglacial bedforms on the continental shelf 118 \nof the Amundsen Sea. Geophysical data were collected during cruises JR84, JR141 and 119 \nJR179 of the RRS James Clark Ross (JCR; 2003, 2006 and 2008), and during cruise ANT-120 \nXXIII\/4 of the RV Polarstern (2006). These data were combined with existing swath 121 \nbathymetric data from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Marine Geosciences Data 122 \nSystem (http:\/\/www.marine-geo.org\/; Fig. 1). Navigation data were acquired using GPS 123 \nreceivers. Ping-edited swath data were gridded at a 30-m cell size.  124 \n3. Subglacial bedforms and features 125 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n6 \n \nA recent regional bathymetric data compilation for the Amundsen Sea Embayment [Nitsche 126 \net al., 2007] shows a continuous cross-shelf trough that arcs north-westwards across the shelf, 127 \nand which has two possible outlets, as depicted by bathymetric depressions: one to the NW 128 \n[Evans et al., 2006], another to the NE (Fig. 1). Hereafter, we refer to these outlets as Pine 129 \nIsland Trough West (PITW) and Pine Island Trough East (PITE).  130 \nOn cruise JR179, we followed the axis of the largely unsurveyed PITE, from its mouth at the 131 \nshelf edge to the main cross-shelf trough, and then continued onwards to the deepest part of 132 \nthe trough on the inner shelf, near the March 2008 fast-ice edge (to within ~100 km of the 133 \nmodern Pine Island ice shelf front). Water depths generally increase inshore along this 400 134 \nkm-long track, from ~500 m at the shelf edge, to >1600 m on the inner shelf (Fig. 1). 135 \nFigure 2a shows grey-scale shaded-relief swath bathymetry from the outer shelf in the PITE 136 \naxis. A suite of crudely-aligned to parallel lineations are observed on the sea floor. Bedforms 137 \nhave a general NNE alignment (25-35\u02da; north azimuth), and occasionally cross cut. They are 138 \nup to 500 m wide, 16 km long, and have amplitudes of 2-6 m (Fig. 2a inset). The maximum 139 \nelongation (length: width) ratio for lineations is ~64:1, and most have ratios greater than 10:1.  140 \nThe main set of imaged lineations are formed on the landward flank of a bathymetric high 141 \nand terminate at a prominent seaward-facing (ice leeward) ramp (Fig. 2a, 3a, 4a). The ramp is 142 \nup to 20 m high, and imaged over a distance of 1700 m, producing a \u2017wedge\u2018 transverse to 143 \nthe trough long-axis at the seabed (GZW1) (Fig. 2a, 3a, 4a). Curvilinear furrows characterise 144 \nthe shallower portions of the surrounding bathymetry, and in places cut across more parallel 145 \nlineations (Fig. 2a). A narrow corridor of multibeam data extending to the northeast of GZW1 146 \nshows that lineations are also present further north. A second ramp, with similar dimensions 147 \nto that forming the seaward limit of GZW1, lies ~20 km to the south of the first wedge 148 \n(GZW2) (Fig. 2a, 3a, 4a), and there are subtle changes in lineation orientations across each of 149 \nthe wedge fronts (on the order of several degrees).        150 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n7 \n \nFollowing the trough south, additional sets of highly-parallel bedforms comprising 151 \nundulating grooves and ridges are apparent at the sea floor, lying within the deepest parts of 152 \nthe trough (Fig. 2b, 5b). Bedforms are 5-14 km in length, 250-490 m in width, and have 153 \namplitudes of 3-20 m; most ~5 m (Fig. 2b inset). These dimensions give rise to high 154 \nelongation ratios, up to 52:1 (minimum 18:1). The trend of the bedforms is again uniformly 155 \nNNE-SSW (31-33\u02da), suggesting they may simply be the up-trough extension (albeit, a 156 \nslightly younger generation) of the bedforms imaged in Figure 2a. The bedforms shown in 157 \nFigs 2a and 2b both lie within the outer shelf region defined by Lowe and Anderson (2002) 158 \ngemorphic Zone 4, in which they suggested the only bedforms are randomly oriented iceberg 159 \nfurrows. 160 \nFarther landward along the trough, additional sets of parallel and attenuated bedforms on the 161 \nmiddle shelf are interrupted at the sea floor by continuous seabed ramps that form prominent 162 \nescarpments, striking transverse to the trough long-axis, and with gently dipping back-slopes 163 \n(Fig. 2c). At least three separate ramps are imaged in the middle shelf area: one at 72\u02da 33\u2018S 164 \n(GZW3 front) (Fig. 3b), another at 72\u02da 42\u2018S (GZW4 front) (Fig. 3c), and a third at 72\u02da 51\u2018S 165 \n(GZW5 front) (Fig. 1, 2c, 3c). In TOPAS profiles and from multibeam analysis, it is apparent 166 \nthat individual ramps are the seaward flanks of sea floor wedges (Fig. 2c inset, 3, 4b). GZW3 167 \nis a small ridge ~15 m high, with a series of more subtle, low amplitude ridges formed behind 168 \nit (Fig. 3b, 4b). GZW4 is ~35 m high at its crest, has an along-trough extent of ~16 km, and is 169 \nimaged within a 2.5 km-wide corridor of multibeam data. Small, lobate mounds characterise 170 \nthe lower slope of the sea floor ramp in front of GZW4 (Fig. 4b). GZW5 is the largest of the 171 \nthree mid-shelf \u2017wedge\u2018 landforms with an estimated volume of at least 6 km3 (50 m average 172 \nheight, by 20 km along-trough extent, by a minimum of 6 km across the wedge front, Fig. 3c; 173 \nnote also the similar slope angles of its northern and southern flanks, Fig. 4b). All the wedges 174 \nare likely formed of sediment, as shown by an existing seismic profile through the landforms 175 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n8 \n \n[Figure 4b in Lowe and Anderson, 2002], and they form a stacked, back-stepping complex on 176 \nthe middle shelf (Fig. 4).     177 \nIndividual streamlined bedform sets are associated with each of the imaged wedges, with 178 \nlineations terminating either at the crest of the seabed ramp (Fig. 2c inset, 3c) or further 179 \nlandward of the wedge back-slope, as a result of ploughing by iceberg keels near the crest 180 \n(Fig. 2c inset, 3c). The orientation of lineations changes progressively up-trough, from a 181 \nNNE-SSW orientation (28-32\u02da) to an NNW-SSE orientation (353\u02da) either side of GZW4 (Fig. 182 \n2c inset, Fig. 3b). On the up-trough flank of GZW5, further large and elongated lineations are 183 \nwell developed at the seabed, and these trend NNW-SSE (353\u02da) (Fig. 2c, 3c). These bedforms 184 \nextend southwards along the trough floor to the transition of the inner to the middle shelf 185 \n(Fig. 2d) [cf. Lowe and Anderson, 2002]. The lineations have dimensions of 4-12 km length, 186 \n~250-500 m width, and amplitudes of 2-10 m (average ~5 m) with length: width ratios up to 187 \n~48:1 (Fig. 2d), and thus are similar to those in Figs. 2a and 2b.   188 \nOn the inner shelf, more than 280 km from the shelf edge, elongated drumlins, less elongate 189 \nstreamlined grooves, meltwater channels and tunnel valleys were reported by Lowe and 190 \nAnderson [2002, 2003]. The authors showed that these features were ubiquitously formed as 191 \nerosional bedforms on substrate that they identified as acoustic basement in seismic profiles 192 \n(which they interpreted as crystalline bedrock). By contrast, all the bedforms and GZWs 193 \ndescribed north of ~73\u02da 30\u2018 S are formed over a seaward-thickening sedimentary substratum, 194 \nas shown in seismic records [Lowe and Anderson, 2002, 2003]. 195 \n4. Palaeoglaciological interpretations 196 \nLarge, straight to curvi-linear lineations on the outermost shelf in the ASE, at the crests of the 197 \ntwo sea-floor wedges closest to the shelf edge (GZW1 and GZW2; Figs. 2a, 3a, 4a), are 198 \ninterpreted as a subglacial or grounding-line proximal bedform signature. We interpret their 199 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n9 \n \nformation at, or close to, a laterally-restricted, grounded, and calving ice-sheet margin (such 200 \nas an ice-stream front) based on their: (1) high elongation ratios and long lengths; (2) few 201 \ncross cuts, and grouping into general parallel to sub-parallel alignments that both suggest 202 \nlocal restriction to movement of grounded ice or icebergs, which are just afloat; (3) distinct, 203 \nrounded ridge-crest surfaces in crossing TOPAS profiles, reminiscent of subglacial lineations 204 \nrather than typically \u2017v\u2018-shaped iceberg ploughmarks; and (4) larger, straighter, and more 205 \nelongate morphology than neighbouring iceberg furrows. The varying types of bedform 206 \ngeometry indicate that the sea floor in this location probably records a mixture of subglacial 207 \nand iceberg-keel ploughed morphologies. Similar mixed morphologies have been observed 208 \non multibeam data in the Vega Trough, and in the Robertson Trough, offshore of the 209 \nAntarctic Peninsula [Fig. 4 in Heroy and Anderson, 2005].        210 \nTo the south on the outer shelf, highly parallel, pervasive sets of ridge-groove streamlined 211 \nbedforms, measuring several to >15 km in length and with elongation ratios between 18-212 \n>60:1, are interpreted, more typically, as subglacial mega-scale glacial lineations [MSGLs; 213 \nClark, 1993; Stokes and Clark, 1999]. MSGLs, analogous in both geometry and form to those 214 \nimaged in this study, are found as a relict expression of fast-flow on many palaeo-ice stream 215 \nbeds [e.g., Wellner et al., 2001; Stokes and Clark, 2002; Shipp et al., 1999, 2002; Evans et al., 216 \n2005; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al. 2005a, 2005b], and have recently been imaged at the bed of the 217 \nRutford Ice Stream in a downstream zone where it is fast-flowing (>300 m yr\n-1\n) confirming, 218 \nthrough direct observation, an ice stream-MSGL connection [King et al., 2009]. Like flutings 219 \non glacial forelands, the MSGLs are aligned parallel to former glacier flow [Clark, 1993]. 220 \nTherefore, the MSGLs in the PITE indicate a dominant flow direction arcing to the N and 221 \nNNE. 222 \nImportantly, MSGLs are also found in association with gravely diamictons in sediment cores 223 \nrecovered from the Pine Island trough, which have been interpreted as subglacial deformation 224 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n10 \n \ntills [Lowe and Anderson, 2002]. Although some studies have prescribed catastrophic 225 \noutbursts of meltwater to explain Antarctic bedform formation [Shaw et al., 2008], 226 \noverwhelming evidence appears to lie in support of the theory that MSGLs form, and ice-227 \nstreams operate upon and within layers of dilatant deforming till, similar if not identical to 228 \nthose recovered from the ASE [King et al., 2009; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., in press]. In many other 229 \nplaces around Antarctica geophysical evidence for MSGLs combined with geological data 230 \nsupporting a deforming sedimentary substrate have been shown to be clear diagnostic criteria 231 \nfor palaeo-ice stream activity [Wellner et al., 2001; Shipp et al., 2002; Anderson et al., 2002; 232 \nDowdeswell et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2005; Heroy and Anderson, 2005; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al. 233 \n2005a, 2005b; Mosola and Anderson, 2006]. Our data from the ASE, in combination with 234 \nprevious core studies [Lowe and Anderson, 2002], support these conclusions. The elongate 235 \nMSGLs also form part of a larger convergent down-flow landform suite including drumlins 236 \nand bedrock grooves, which are generally considered typical of a palaeo-ice stream landform 237 \ncontinuum [Wellner et al., 2001; Graham et al., 2009]. 238 \nThe bedforms in the eastern ASE therefore record the former presence of a fast-flowing 239 \ngrounded ice stream (the PITIS) that drained through Pine Island Bay and its seaward 240 \nextension, Pine Island Trough East. The bedforms clearly lie in the centre and deepest parts 241 \nof the main cross-shelf trough as depicted by bathymetric profiles, and as expected for the 242 \nlocale of a major palaeo-ice stream (Fig. 5a and 5b). The pristine preservation of the 243 \nbedforms, combined with the published deglacial chronology [Lowe and Anderson, 2002], 244 \nindicates that this ice stream existed at and shortly after the LGM and that ice must have 245 \ngrounded to within 68 km of the shelf edge. Beyond the most northeasterly streamlined 246 \nbedforms, any further grounded-ice indicators have been removed by ice keel ploughmarks. 247 \nThus, the PITIS must have occupied a minimum of ~87% of the currently ice-free trough, 248 \nand probably covered extensive parts of the shelf outside of it at the LGM.  249 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n11 \n \nSets of bedforms on the middle shelf, aligned at different orientations to the flowset on the 250 \nouter shelf, record the back-stepping subglacial imprint of the ice stream during its retreat 251 \nacross the continental shelf. Bedform sets are commonly associated with pronounced 252 \nsedimentary wedges, which we interpret as grounding zone wedges (GZWs 1-5) (Fig. 3, 4): 253 \ndepositional accumulations formed at ice-stream mouths during stillstands of the grounding 254 \nline where deformable till sheets at the ice-bed act as sediment-conveyors [Alley et al., 1989; 255 \nAnderson, 2007; Anandakrishnan et al., 2007]. The fact that bedforms terminate at wedge 256 \nfronts and are well-preserved in \u2017soft\u2018 sedimentary strata [Lowe and Anderson, 2002] 257 \nindicate that they are features formed during recent ice recession rather than older lineations 258 \nthat have been subsequently overridden [cf. \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005a; Dowdeswell et al., 259 \n2008]. Smaller mounds and flow-transverse ridges are interpreted as proglacial debris flows 260 \nor minor recessional moraines, both associated with ice-marginal sediment delivery (Fig. 3b); 261 \nthe scale and corrugated, sub-parallel morphology of the latter compare well to \u2017corrugation 262 \nmoraines\u2018 that formed during the last deglaciation and were mapped in cross-shelf troughs in 263 \nthe Ross Sea [Shipp et al., 2002; Dowdeswell et al., 2008]. The presence of GZWs 264 \ninterspersed by distinct MSGL flowsets identifies an episodic style of deglaciation [e.g., 265 \nLarter and Vanneste, 1995; Dowdeswell et al. 2008; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al. 2008], with stepped 266 \ngrounding line retreat across the continental shelf. These GZWs afford a preliminary 267 \nreconstruction of the retreat pattern of the PITIS, where former stationary or readvanced 268 \npositions of the grounding line can be traced (Fig. 1, marked by purple lines).  269 \nOn the inner shelf, bathymetric sills were likely to provide additional pinning points for the 270 \ngrounding line in a zone where sediments are sparse and the topography is highly pronounced 271 \n(Fig. 5c). Bedforms scoured into acoustic basement elsewhere on the inner shelf are 272 \ninterpreted as the upstream signature of palaeo-ice flow in the former Pine Island and 273 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n12 \n \nThwaites glacier systems [Lowe and Anderson, 2002, 2003], though they may not all relate to 274 \nice streaming at the LGM [cf. Graham et al., 2009].  275 \n5. Flow outlet of the Pine Island-Thwaites Ice Stream 276 \nUsing an earlier, more limited multibeam dataset, Evans et al. [2006] suggested that the main 277 \noutlet from Pine Island Trough at the LGM drained to the NW via a trough that reaches the 278 \nshelf edge at 114\u02da W (PITW) (Fig. 6). The presence of subdued streamlined bedforms within 279 \nthis NW trough does support the idea that ice drained through this outlet at some point in the 280 \npast. However, MSGLs on the outer shelf along the PITE at 106\u02da W are more pristine and 281 \nhave greater elongation ratios than those in the PITW, which suggests that major discharge 282 \nand outflow of the PITIS at its last maximum extent was directed to the northeast along the 283 \nPITE (cf. Figs 2b and 6). We rule out variation in post-glacial sediment coverage to explain 284 \ndifferences in bedform preservation between PITE and PITW. Evans et al. [2006] showed 285 \nonly a thin post-glacial sediment drape in the PITW from acoustic profiles, and thin post-286 \nglacial sediments were also recovered in cores from the PITE [Lowe and Anderson, 2002]. 287 \nLine A-A\u2018 is the only continuous west-east bathymetric profile to cross the PITE on the outer 288 \nshelf, near the NE Amundsen Sea shelf break (Fig 5a). In conjunction with our multibeam 289 \ndatasets, it shows, for the first time, that the PITE actually continues to the shelf edge 290 \nsupporting a main flow outlet in this location (Fig. 1, shown by the regions of bathymetry 291 \nshaded in orange; Fig. 5a).   292 \nIn the Pine Island cross-shelf trough, Lowe and Anderson [2002, 2003] also defined a number 293 \nof geomorphic zones forming a downflow progressive model across the inner and middle 294 \nshelf. Much of the sea bed on the Amundsen Sea outer shelf has been pervasively scoured by 295 \nicebergs so our discovery of subglacial bedforms in the PITE is significant for showing ice 296 \nextent beyond the middle shelf, where streamlined features were previously thought to 297 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n13 \n \nterminate [Lowe and Anderson, 2002, 2003]. These bedform patterns show that there was 298 \nstreaming ice flow, at various time intervals, over an along-trough distance of at least ~200 299 \nkm on the middle-to-outer shelf, demonstrating fast-flow at the scale of or even larger than 300 \nother major ice-stream systems in West Antarctica during the LGM, such as those in 301 \nMarguerite Trough [\u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005b], Belgica Trough [\u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005a], Boyd 302 \nStrait [Canals et al., 2000], Anvers Trough [Pudsey et al., 1994; Domack et al., 2005], and the 303 \nRoss Sea [Shipp et al., 1999; Mosola and Anderson, 2006]. Our study indicates an extensive 304 \npalaeo-ice stream in the eastern ASE and strongly supports previous interpretations that the 305 \nWAIS in this sector reached the shelf edge at the LGM [Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Evans et 306 \nal., 2006].  307 \n6. Outer shelf ice dynamics 308 \nWhile we consider it likely that the PITE was the main outlet for the PITIS, the presence of 309 \ntwo well-preserved subglacial bedform sets, in separate outer-shelf troughs, points to 310 \ncomplex ice dynamics. Figure 7 illustrates three possible interpretations, which could be used 311 \nto reconcile the two datasets. 312 \nOur favoured interpretation is that phases of ice streaming within the PITE and PITW were 313 \nasynchronous (Fig. 7a). Switching ice-stream flow between the two adjacent troughs 314 \nprobably produced the bedforms at different times [cf. Dowdeswell et al., 2006a], and we 315 \nsuggest that flow through PITW preceded the flow through PITE. This flow-switching 316 \nscenario is supported by: (1) the better preservation and exceptional clarity of the bedform 317 \nsignature in the PITE compared with that in the PITW, suggesting a younger age of the 318 \nMSGLs to the northeast; (2) the presence of only a single major trough crossing the inner and 319 \nmiddle shelf, but two well-defined outer-shelf outlets; (3) the deeper incision of the PITE 320 \noutlet into the shelf when compared to the PITW outlet (i.e. incision to different base levels; 321 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n14 \n \nFig. 5b), which increases the likelihood of earlier ice flow being captured by more dominant 322 \nice-stream flow draining through the PITE; (4) the existence of slope gullies at the mouth of 323 \nboth the PITE and PITW which indicate that slope processes have probably been diachronous 324 \nacross the Amundsen Sea margin. Although there is contention over their mode of formation 325 \n[Noormerts et al., 2009], gullies at the mouth of the PITW were interpreted as derived from 326 \nsediment-laden meltwater or slope instability flows [Dowdeswell et al. 2006b; Noormets et 327 \nal. 2009], whereas slope debris flows more typical of ice marginal sediment delivery are 328 \nfound near the mouth of the PITE [Dowdeswell et al., 2006b]. This disparity would appear to 329 \nsupport a younger age for the PITE.  330 \nClear evidence of flow switching of this kind has been found in 3D seismic data from the 331 \nNorth Norwegian margin, linked to sedimentary infill of accommodation space within cross-332 \nshelf troughs [Dowdeswell et al., 2006a]. Flow-switching in ice streams has not been directly 333 \nobserved in ice masses, but is suspected to be possible driven by changing subglacial water 334 \ndrainage [Vaughan et al., 2008] and has almost certainly occurred in the recent past [Conway 335 \net al., 2002]. 336 \nAn alternative interpretation is that two separate ice-flow limbs were synchronous features 337 \nwithin the Late Quaternary WAIS and existed as two bifurcating ice streams on the outer 338 \nshelf (Fig. 7b). However, very few bifurcating analogues are observed in contemporary ice 339 \nsheets, and most reconstructions of Quaternary palaeo-ice sheets in the northern hemisphere 340 \nlack evidence for ice-stream bifurcation in their downstream regions [Ottesen et al., 2005, 341 \n2008; Stokes et al., 2009].  342 \nA third hypothesis is that the two outlets and their bedform signatures result from one large 343 \nfast-flow sector across the outer shelf, with ice flow in the form of a divergent \u2017sheet\u2018 (Fig. 344 \n7c). To test this idea, we estimated a potential discharge for sheet flow across the area of 345 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n15 \n \nouter shelf from the PITW to the PITE, assuming a minimum cross-sectional flow area of 346 \n~400 km x 550 m. The PITIS basin, including the now-submerged shelf areas and modern 347 \nPine Island-Thwaites catchment, would cover an accumulation area of ~500,000 km\n2\n at the 348 \nLGM; approximately three times the size of the modern Pine Island Glacier catchment. By 349 \nscaling the modern net surface accumulation over Pine Island Glacier catchment (~69-71 km\n3 \n350 \nice yr\n-1\n) [Rignot, 2006] to this catchment area (~207-213 km\n3 \nice yr\n-1\n), and assuming 351 \nsignificantly lower precipitation rates during the LGM (approximately half; ~105 km\n3 \nice yr\n-\n352 \n1\n) we show it would be possible to sustain sheet discharge through this gate at a velocity of 353 \n~480 m yr\n-1\n: a fast-flow rate comparable to some contemporary Antarctic ice streams. 354 \nHowever, while some models of ice sheets predict \u2017sheet\u2018-style flows at marine margins 355 \n[Hubbard et al., 2009], modern glacial analogues remain absent, at least at similar scales (but 356 \nsee Malaspina Glacier, Alaska, for a possible scaled-down comparison) [Sharpe, 1958]. 357 \nTherefore, while conceivable, we do not favour this interpretation.   358 \nRegardless of the specific scenario, our data document a major discharge of the ancient Pine 359 \nIsland-Thwaites ice stream along the PITE. Taking into account a lowered sea level at the 360 \nLGM of ~120 m, a minimum ice thickness of 715 m is estimated if ice grounded in the 361 \ntrough at 72\u02da 30\u2018S. This estimate neglects any glacio-isostatic depression of the shelf by the 362 \nice that extended onto it, which would make the minimum ice thickness even greater. This 363 \ncross-section would, in turn, accommodate a minimum flux of ~108 km\n3\n ice yr \n-1\n (based on 364 \nan assigned flow velocity of 2.5 km yr\n-1\n) exceeding the modern grounding line flux of 75-80 365 \nkm\n3\n ice yr \n-1\n from Pine Island Glacier today (where velocity is measured at ~ 2.5 km yr \n-1\n). 366 \nThus, we deduce the PITIS to have been a key drainage feature of the WAIS, since at least 367 \nthe last glacial period.    368 \n7. Retreat of the Pine Island-Thwaites Ice Stream 369 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n16 \n \nOur data appear to show that multiple GZWs formed at the grounding line of the PITIS as it 370 \nretreated from the outer and middle shelf. Previously, only a single wedge had been identified 371 \nin the PITE [Lowe and Anderson, 2002] with a second tentatively suggested for the PITW at 372 \n~108\u00b0 W by Evans et al. [2006]. Our geophysical data show that the mid-shelf wedge of 373 \nLowe and Anderson (2002) is in fact a complex of back-stepping wedges, formed at a 374 \nnumber of ice marginal positions (Fig. 4). This geometry suggests that the ice margin 375 \nperiodically stabilised during retreat, when stillstands of the grounding line may have 376 \noccurred. The presence of large GZWs (minimum volume of ~6 km\n3\n for GZW5) indicates 377 \nsignificant subglacial erosion - of the upstream portion of the ice stream trunk and the 378 \nAntarctic interior - and shows that the ice stream was also a major conduit for basal sediment 379 \ntransport, at least during the early deglacial phase. The lack of comparatively thick sediment 380 \ncover on parts of the inner shelf may be due to the PITIS stripping sediment from its bed 381 \nduring ice retreat [Smith and Murray, 2009].  382 \nDespite new constraints on palaeo-ice margin location, the deglacial history of the PITIS 383 \nsince the LGM remains poorly constrained. The chronology of PITIS retreat is restricted to a 384 \nradiocarbon age of ~15.8 \u00b1 3.9 \n14\nC ka BP obtained from deglacial transitional sediments on 385 \nthe mid-shelf near Burke Island and a minimum age of ~10.2 \u00b1 0.4 \n14\nC ka BP for grounding-386 \nline retreat from the inner shelf (at 73\u00b0 55\u2018 S and 106\u00b0 39\u2018 W) of the PITE [Lowe and 387 \nAnderson, 2002]. However, these ages give little insight into the duration of stillstands during 388 \ngrounding line migration up the trough. If we adopt sediment flux for an ice stream of similar 389 \nsize to the PITIS [e.g., 8 x 10\n3\n m\n3\n yr\n-1\n per metre width, Norwegian Channel Palaeo-Ice 390 \nStream; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2007], we can calculate an equivalent total sediment flux from its 391 \ngrounding line, across a GZW of minimum 6 km width (and 6 km\n3\n volume; similar to 392 \nGZW5), of ~0.05 km\n3\n yr\n-1\n. Under these constant flux conditions, it is feasible for GZWs in 393 \nthe eastern Amundsen Sea to have formed in ~120 years (i.e., on centennial timescales). This 394 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n17 \n \nrough estimate differs with previous interpretations, which suggest that GZW formation may 395 \nstabilise an ice margin for thousands of years or more [Anderson, 2007]. Consequently, 396 \nlandforms of \u2015episodic\u2016 retreat in the ASE may not necessarily indicate prolonged ice-margin 397 \nrecession, but may instead be manifestations of effective sediment delivery during a 398 \npunctuated but otherwise rapid deglaciation [Larter and Vanneste, 1995; Dowdeswell et al., 399 \n2008].  400 \nThe observed landform configuration (presence of GZWs and the lack of recessional 401 \nmoraines) on the outer shelf generally supports our interpretations of a rapid, though episodic 402 \nPITIS retreat [cf. Dowdeswell et al. 2008; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2008]. Runaway collapse, of the 403 \nmodern ice sheet has been suggested where the ice-bed slopes continuously into the ice-sheet 404 \ninterior [Vaughan and Arthern, 2007]. For the PITE and PITIS, the palaeo-ice bed from the 405 \nouter shelf to the inner 50 km of the shelf consists of a broadly continual reverse slope 406 \ntowards the coast (Fig. 5c). Notably, the only breaks in this gradient are locations where the 407 \nsea floor levels out to form \u2015benches\u2016. These benches occur in close association with 408 \ngrounding zone wedges (Fig. 5c), and the dimensions of the GZWs themselves are too small 409 \nto account for the changes in sea-floor slope. Thus, periods of relative stability in ice retreat 410 \nappear to have coincided with ice grounding on lower gradient beds (average slope measured 411 \nat 0.015\u00ba), while well-preserved bedforms occur on beds with higher gradients (average slope 412 \nmeasured at 0.149\u00ba), with no evidence for grounding line stabilization in these areas. This 413 \nrelationship suggests phases of rapid retreat over beds with greater slopes. Therefore, our 414 \nobservations lend support to model experiments indicating that stepped patterns of ice-stream 415 \nretreat are highly sensitive to the gradient of the bed on which they are grounded [Weertman, 416 \n1974; Schoof, 2007].  417 \nBetween the wedges, the presence of MSGLs indicates that either: (1) ice streamed 418 \nconsistently during the retreat, or (2) renewed onset of streaming occurred prior to each phase 419 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n18 \n \nof ice margin recession. The feasibility of these dynamic patterns of ice-stream retreat may be 420 \ntested by future coupled glaciological-sedimentary models, which attempt to reconstruct the 421 \nretreat history of major West Antarctic ice stream systems. Such models should seek to 422 \nreplicate periodic stillstands of the PITIS grounding line. 423 \n8. Conclusions 424 \nWe have identified a major LGM-outlet of the Pine Island and Thwaites ice streams in the 425 \nASE, based on observations from new sea floor and sub-bottom imagery. Addressing the 426 \nhypotheses introduced at the start of the paper, we conclude the following: 427 \n(1) Streamlined glacial bedforms show that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet extended to 428 \nwithin 68 km of, and probably right up to, the continental shelf edge in the 429 \nnortheastern Amundsen Sea Embayment at the LGM, supporting previous studies 430 \nfarther west in the embayment, which suggested extensive LGM ice-sheet limits 431 \n[Evans et al., 2006; Larter et al., 2009];  432 \n(2) The major drainage pathway of the PITIS can be traced along a cross-shelf trough that 433 \nconnects to a trough-mouth on the outer shelf at ~106\u00ba W. This mouth was likely the 434 \nmain outlet for the PITIS. Earlier phases of ice flow may have diverted along an 435 \nouter-shelf trough to the west, with an outlet at ~114\u00ba W. Flow-switching is our 436 \nfavoured explanation for the presence of the two outlets, and the two sets of bedforms 437 \npreserved within each outer-shelf trough. 438 \n(3) Sea-floor geomorphic evidence constrains a stepped, episodic style of deglaciation for 439 \nthe PITIS. The course of ice retreat from the outer and middle shelf in the trough of 440 \nthe eastern ASE is shown by five grounding zone wedges, which formed during 441 \nretreat. Stillstands occurred in association with changes in subglacial bed gradient, 442 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n19 \n \nand we suggest that more rapid phases of retreat correlated to higher bed slopes. 443 \nProminent bedrock pinning points on the inner shelf probably served to halt this 444 \nretreat even further, as the grounding line receded to its present-day configuration. 445 \nFurther chronological data from sediment cores are urgently required to better verify 446 \nthe timing of stepwise retreat during the last deglaciation. 447 \nAcknowledgements 448 \nWe thank the captains and crews of the RRS James Clark Ross and RV Polarstern, and 449 \nshipboard parties of numerous cruises, for collecting data.

Three-dimensional perspective images of multibeam swath bathymetry illustrating 473 \nfive grounding zone wedges (GZWs) along the Pine Island cross-shelf trough, seaward of 474 \nGRAHAM et al: PINE ISLAND-THWAITES PALAEO-ICE STREAM \n20 \n \nPine Island Bay. Note ice flow direction arrows, and that Figure 3c is rotated so that palaeo-475 \nice flow is towards the reader. Thick black arrows mark the crests of each wedge. For 476 \nlocation of GZWs see the labels in Figure 1. Grid cell size 40 m. See online version for 477 \ncolour figure. 478 \nFigure 4. TOPAS sub-bottom acoustic profile showing back-stepping grounding zone 479 \nwedges: (a) on the outer shelf (GZW 1 and GZW 2); dashed line shows splice of two profile 480 \nparts; (b) on the middle-shelf within the Pine Island cross-shelf trough (GZW3, GZW4 and 481 \nGZW5). The crests of the wedges are arrowed, and indicate palaeo-grounding lines as 482 \nillustrated in Figure 1 (purple lines). Profiles located on Figure 1 as thick white lines, and as 483 \nboxes on Figure 5c.   484 \nFigure 5. Bathymetric profiles A-A\u2018 and B-B\u2018 illustrating the physiographic setting of the two 485 \nouter shelf troughs derived from the grid presented in Nitsche et al. [2007]. Note the 486 \ncontinuation of the PITE towards the shelf edge. C-C\u2018 shows the long-axis profile of the main 487 \nPine Island cross-shelf trough and the PITE, derived from the compiled swath bathymetry 488 \ngrid shown in Figure 1. Locations see Figure 1.    489 \nFigure 6.
