E-region irregularity velocity measurements at\nlarge flow angles with the STARE Finland coherent VHF\nradar are considered in context of the ion and electron ve-\nlocity data provided by the EISCAT tristatic radar system,\nCUTLASS Finland coherent HF radar, and IMAGE fluxgate\nmagnetometers. The data have been collected during a spe-\ncial experiment on 27 March 2004 during which EISCAT\nwas scanning between several E- and one F-region altitudes\nalong the magnetic field line. Within the E-region, the\nEISCAT measurements at two altitudes of 110 and 115 km\nare considered while the electron velocity is inferred from\nthe EISCAT ion velocity measurements at 278 km. The line-\nof-sight (l-o-s) VHF velocity measured by STARE VVHF los\nis compared to the ion and electron velocity components\n(Vi0 comp and Ve0 comp) along the STARE l-o-s direction. The\ncomparison with Ve0 comp for the entire event shows that the\nmeasurements exhibit large scatter and small positive cor-\nrelation. The correlation with Ve0 comp was substantial in\nthe first half of the interval under study when Ve0 comp was\nlarger in magnitude. The comparison with Vi0 comp at 110\nand 115 km shows a considerable positive correlation, with\nVHF velocity being typically larger (smaller) in magnitude\nthan Vi0 comp at 110 km (115 km) so that VVHF los appears to\nbe bounded by the ion velocity components at two altitudes.\nIt is also demonstrated that the difference between VVHF los\nand Vi0 comp at 110 km can be treated, in the first approxima-\ntion, as a linear function of the effective backscatter height\nheff also counted from 110 km; heff varies in the range 108\u2013\n114 km due to the altitude integration effects in the scattering\ncross-section. Our results are consistent with the notion that\nCorrespondence to: R. A. Makarevich\n(r.makarevich@latrobe.edu.au)\nVHF velocity at large flow angles is directly related to the\nion drift velocity component at an altitude heff.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Ionospheric ir-\nregularities; Plasma convection)\n1 Introduction\nIn the auroral E-region (100\u2013120 km in altitude), strong elec-\ntric fields E in the presence of the geomagnetic field B drive\nthe electrons through the ion gas with a velocity close to\nthat of the E\u00d7B drift, which creates favourable conditions\nfor the development of the two-stream or Farley-Buneman\n(F-B) instability and formation of field-aligned irregulari-\nties (Farley, 1963; Buneman, 1963). For the primary F-B\ninstability to be excited at a certain angle \u03b8 with respect\nto the electron background drift velocity Ve0, the electron\ndrift component Ve0 cos \u03b8 should be in excess of the ion\nacoustic speed Cs , which defines a finite cone of flow an-\ngles \u03b8<\u03b80\u223c= cos\u22121(Cs\/Ve0) for primary F-B waves. At large\nflow angles, close to perpendicularity to Ve0 and outside of\nthe instability cone, secondary plasma waves can be gener-\nated through nonlinear cascade if the level of primary density\nperturbations reaches a certain level (Sudan et al., 1973). The\nphase velocity of the secondary waves is significantly more\ndifficult to derive theoretically and is often assumed to be\nequal to the phase velocity of the primary waves (\u223cVe0 cos \u03b8 ,\ncosine law), which has been supported to some extent by nu-\nmerical simulations (e.g. Keskinen et al., 1979).\nExperimentally, coherent radars have been an invaluable\ntool for studying E-region irregularities as they provide infor-\nmation on the amplitude and phase velocity of perturbations\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2376 R. A. Makarevich et al.: Comparison of irregularity and ion drift velocities in the E-region\nin spatially extended regions of the ionosphere (see, for ex-\nample, review papers by Fejer and Kelley, 1980; Haldoupis,\n1989; Sahr and Fejer, 1996). The relationship between the\nDoppler velocity measured by coherent radars and electron\ndrift velocity for observations at large flow angles has been\nthe subject of numerous investigations. Evidence in support\nof the cosine law at VHF has been derived from compar-\nisons of the Doppler velocity measurements by the Scandi-\nnavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE) 140-MHz\nradar system and European Incoherent Radar (EISCAT) fa-\ncility observations of the ion drift velocity in the F-region\nused as a proxy for Ve0 in the lower, E-region altitudes\n(Nielsen and Schlegel, 1985; Nielsen et al., 2002). For ob-\nservations with the 440-MHz Millstone Hill radar, del Pozo\net al. (1993) compared coherent echo observations performed\nwith the antennae side lobe and E\u00d7B drift measurements\nwith the main lobe and found good agreement between the\ncoherent velocity and the E\u00d7B drift velocity component. In\nother UHF studies, however, the rate of velocity change with\nazimuth near the velocity reversal was much faster than that\nimplied by the cosine law (see Moorcroft, 1996, and refer-\nences therein). At HF, several studies found a good match\nbetween the data collected with Super Dual Auroral Radar\nNetwork (SuperDARN) HF radars and the cosine law predic-\ntion (Villain et al., 1987; Jayachandran et al., 2000), although\nstatistically E-region velocity at HF was demonstrated to be\nby \u223c30% smaller than the electron drift component from\nEISCAT observations (Davies et al., 1999).\nMore observations casting doubt on the validity of the co-\nsine law have been presented in a series of recent studies by\nKoustov et al. (2002) and Uspensky et al. (2003) at VHF and\nby Makarevitch et al. (2002, 2004a) and Milan et al. (2004)\nat HF. It has been suggested that the observations could be\nexplained if the ion motion contribution to the phase veloc-\nity of E-region irregularities is taken into account as pre-\nscribed by generalized formulas of the linear theory in the\nframe of reference of the neutrals. Indeed, at large flow an-\ngles \u03b8\u223c90\u25e6, the ion drift velocity Vi0 becomes comparable\nwith that of electrons, as Vi0 is oriented roughly perpendic-\nular to Ve0, Vi0 sin \u03b8\u2265Ve0 cos \u03b8 . In all of the above stud-\nies, however, no ion drift velocity measurements in the E-\nregion were available. Instead, the studies have used generic,\n\u201cmodel\u201d estimates for Vi0 using simultaneous F-region mea-\nsurements of Ve0 by EISCAT (Uspensky et al., 2003) or from\nfurther ranges of the SuperDARN radar (Makarevitch et al.,\n2004a), which allowed the most salient features of the ob-\nserved backscatter to be largely explained.\nIn this study, we explore the relationship between the\nE-region irregularity velocity at large flow angles and elec-\ntron and ion background motions by directly comparing the\ncoherent Doppler velocity measurements with the incoher-\nent radar measurements of the ion drift velocity in the E- and\nF-regions.\n2 Observations\n2.1 Experimental setup\nThe ion drift velocity measurements employed in this study\nhave been collected by the EISCAT UHF tristatic incoher-\nent radar system (928 MHz) operated in a special mode de-\nsigned to measure the E-region ion drift velocity in conjunc-\ntion with the coherent Doppler velocity observations by the\nSTARE Finland VHF radar (140 MHz) and the Co-operative\nUK Twin Located Auroral Sounding System (CUTLASS)\nFinland HF radar (\u223c12 MHz) with the latter also operated\nin a special mode.\nThe EISCAT UHF facility consists of three parabolic dish\nantennas with one site in Troms\u00f8 combining both trans-\nmitting and receiving capabilities and two remote site re-\nceivers at Kiruna and Sodankyla\u00a8 (Rishbeth and Williams,\n1985; Davies et al., 1999). The EISCAT radar measures ion-\nacoustic spectra, from which electron density, ion l-o-s velo-\ncity, electron temperature, and ion\/electron temperature ratio\ncan be computed. On 27\u201328 March 2004, 12:00\u201318:00 UT,\nEISCAT operated in a special E-region Ion Drift (ERID)\nmode with the Troms\u00f8 radar looking along the magnetic field\nline at an azimuth of 184\u25e6 and elevation of 77.1\u25e6. The remote\nsite radars performed an \u201cinterleaved\u201d scan, intersecting the\nTroms\u00f8 beam at 6 altitudes (278, 110, 90, 278, 115, 105,\nand 95 km). The duration of each scan was 10 min, with the\ndwell time in each position being 75 s, except for the height\nof 110 km where the dwell time was twice as long, i.e. 150 s.\nFor the present study, the EISCAT remote site data were post-\nintegrated over the dwell time at each scan position and the\nTroms\u00f8 data were post-integrated over 75 s. Tristatic velocity\nwas obtained from the three line-of-sight (l-o-s) components\nusing the method outlined in Rishbeth and Williams (1985).\nThe STARE Finland VHF radar (140 MHz) uses the in-\nformation from the first two lags of auto correlation func-\ntion (ACF) to determine the Doppler velocity and backscat-\nter power of the E-region echoes at \u223c110 km (Greenwald\net al., 1978; Nielsen, 1982). This radar\u2019s field-of-view (FoV)\nis 28.8\u25e6-wide, with the boresite direction at \u201319.1\u25e6 E. The\ndata are collected for 8 radar beams (from 1 to 8) sepa-\nrated by 3.6\u25e6 in azimuth. The integration time is 20 s. In\nterms of range, the measurements are performed from 495\nto 1245 km with 15-km resolution. The intersection of the\nEISCAT field-aligned beam with the ionosphere at 110 km\n(69.33\u25e6 N, 19.16\u25e6 E) is located close to the STARE Finland\nradar cell corresponding to beam 4 (geographic azimuth of\n\u201320.9\u25e6) and bin 24 (range of 855 km) assuming straight line\npropagation from the radar site (62.3\u25e6 N, 26.6\u25e6 E) to 110 km.\nDuring the data post-processing, echoes with low signal-to-\nnoise ratio (<1 dB) were excluded from further analysis.\nThe CUTLASS Finland HF radar forms the most easterly\npart of the SuperDARN chain of HF radars (Greenwald et al.,\n1995; Milan et al., 1997). It measures a 17-lag ACF from\nwhich estimates of the Doppler velocity, power, and spectral\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 2375\u20132389, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2375\/2006\/\nR. A.

Similar to the STARE radar, CUTLASS velocity\nis, by convention, positive towards the radar. In the ERID\nexperiment, the CUTLASS Finland radar was working in the\nStereo-Myopic mode performing a scan in frequency (near 8,\n12, 14, 16, and 18 MHz) on channel B, with the frequency on\nchannel A being fixed (\u223c10 MHz). The dwell time at each\nbeam position was 3 s, and the scan in azimuth was com-\npleted in 1 min. The range gate length was 15 km, with the\nfirst range gate of 180 km (see Milan et al., 2003; Lester et al.,\n2004, for details on the Stereo and Myopic modes).\nThe region of interest was also monitored by mag-\nnetometers of the International Monitor for Auroral Ge-\nomagnetic Effects (IMAGE) network (e.g., Lu\u00a8hr et al.,\n1998), with the closest magnetometer station at Troms\u00f8\n(69.66\u25e6 N, 18.94\u25e6 E), and by the Imaging Riometer for Iono-\nspheric Studies (IRIS) at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (69.02\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E).\nThe IMAGE magnetometers measure the north (X), east\n(Y ), and vertical (Z) components of magnetic field with 10-s\nresolution from which the structure of electrojet currents at\nE-region heights of 100\u2013110 km can be estimated. The IRIS\nriometer (Browne et al., 1995) records the non-deviative ab-\nsorption of cosmic noise due to the particle precipitation at\n38.2 MHz at 49 different directions with 1-s resolution.\n2.2 Event overview\nIn this study we concentrate on a 3-h period between 15:00\nand 18:00 UT on 27 March 2004, as this was the inter-\nval during which both the STARE and CUTLASS Finland\nradars observed coherent echoes at the radar cells near the\nEISCAT viewing area. This event provides a unique op-\nportunity for studying the E-region irregularity velocity as\nobserved by VHF and HF radars in the context of informa-\ntion on the plasma motions provided by an incoherent scatter\nradar. Figure 1 presents the range-time-intensity (RTI) plots\nof irregularity l-o-s velocity in (a) STARE Finland beam 4\nand (b) CUTLASS Finland beam 5. Both velocities have\nbeen reversed so that the majority of the RTI cells are filled\nwith the solid color (negative velocity), while cells filled\nwith horizontal lines indicate that positive velocities were\nrecorded. The STARE range cell closest to the EISCAT beam\nis shown by the dashed line (bin 24, 855 km) in panel (a). In\npanel (b), Doppler velocity at all frequencies is plotted for\nranges >780 km (dotted line), while for closer ranges only\nthe velocity in channel A (10 MHz) is considered.\nPanel (c) shows the equivalent current component along\nthe CUTLASS beam 5 direction. This has been estimated\nfrom the IMAGE magnetic perturbations as described be-\nlow. The electrojet equivalent current vector was derived by\nrotating the horizontal magnetic perturbation vector by 90\u25e6\nclockwise for each 1-min interval. This variation was com-\nputed for all stations in the IMAGE network for which data\nwere available for this event and the results were interpo-\nlated between 15\u25e6\u201328\u25e6 E and 64\u25e6\u201372\u25e6 N using a 0.5\u25e6-step.\nPanel (c) is a range-time-intensity plot along the CUTLASS\nbeam 5 direction from the interpolated data. It provides a\nuseful context for considering the variation of the E\u00d7B drift\nvelocity component along the coherent radar beam direction\nsince the latter can be approximated by the reversed com-\nponent of the equivalent current assuming that the magnetic\nperturbations were mainly caused by the convection-related\nHall electrojet currents in the absence of large density gradi-\nents (Fukushima, 1976).\nThe STARE radar started to detect echoes at the farther\nranges of 700\u20131100 km at \u223c15:15 UT. The echoes became\nmore abundant and formed a wide (\u223c500 km) band which\nstarted to move equatorward at around 16:00 UT, shortly be-\nfore the CUTLASS radar started to observe F-region echoes\nnear EISCAT (above dotted line). In addition to F-region HF\nechoes, from 16:15 UT onwards, a \u223c150-km-wide band of\nE-region HF echoes at 400\u2013550 km was observed. At far-\nther ranges, the F-region velocity changed its sign between\n16:30 and 16:45 UT and in general agreed reasonably well\nwith the equivalent current component shown in panel (c),\nwhich is not surprising since F-region velocity measured at\na given direction should represent the E\u00d7B drift component\n(e.g. Davies et al., 1999).\nThe E\u00d7B drift velocity can be also inferred from the\nEISCAT tristatic measurements of ion velocity in the\nF-region since both plasma species should drift with E\u00d7B\ndrift velocity at these heights. In Fig. 2 we show (a) the\nelectron density measurements, (b) the magnitude and (c)\nthe direction of the field-perpendicular ion velocity vector at\n278, 115, and 110 km. The ion velocity data at 90, 95, and\n105 km also collected in this experiment were not consid-\nered in the present study, as these exhibited very large scat-\nter and since the electron density and hence signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) were typically lower than those for higher alti-\ntudes (above 110 km), Fig. 2a. Figure 2 also shows (dotted\nblack lines) the E\u00d7B vector (b) magnitude and (c) direction\nas inferred from the magnetic perturbations at Troms\u00f8. The\nyellow dots in panels (b) and (c) are the F-region velocity\nmagnitude and direction, respectively, determined from fit-\nting the cosine law curve VF cos(\u03c6+\u03c60), where \u03c6 is the angle\nbetween the radar beam and magnetic L-shell, to all HF ve-\nlocities in the F-region as described in detail by Makarevitch\net al. (2004a). The latter estimate represents the averaged\n(for all radar beams and ranges 780\u20131215 km) plasma con-\nvection in the F-region.

At\u223c16:42 UT a large density enhancement, local-\nized in time, was observed in the EISCAT data (Fig. 2a). We\nhave indicated this time by the vertical line in Figs. 1 and 2.\nThe ion velocities at 115 and 110 km generally exhibited sim-\nilar trends to that at 278 km (V 115i0 \u223cV 278i0 \/2, V 110i0 \u223cV 278i0 \/4)\nexcept that they did not show undulations near 16:20 UT.\nThe ion velocity direction at 278 km was very close to \u201390\u25e6\nin azimuth (lowest horizontal dotted line in Fig. 2c, west-\nward drift) for the first half of the interval under study, and\nit was rotated by \u223c30\u25e6 clockwise from the westward direc-\ntion after \u223c16:30 UT. Again, the ion velocity directions at\n115 and 110 km followed that at 278 km, being rotated by\nroughly 45\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 anticlockwise, respectively. The other\ntwo E\u00d7B drift estimates (from magnetic perturbations and F-\nregion HF data) showed similar trends to V278i0 except for the\ninterval near the density enhancement at \u223c16:42 UT when\nthe E\u00d7B drift estimate from magnetic perturbations was sig-\nnificantly different from V278i0 .\nLarge undulations in the EISCAT ion drifts (and hence in\nelectric field) were only seen at 278 km.

After\n16:30 UT, variation in the ion drift magnitude is generally\nconsistent with those in equivalent current and ion drifts at\n110 and 115 km, Fig. 2b.\nFinally, one should note that between 8 March and 2 De-\ncember 2004 the STARE Finland site computer had an accu-\nmulative timing error reaching 3 h 41 min 48 s at 07:31:10 UT\non 2 December 2004. To correct the timing error the\nSTARE Finland data was shifted by an appropriate in-\nterval (\u223c17 min) assuming linear error accumulation. In\nFigs. 1 and 2 the vertical line shows the time 16:42 UT\nwhen EISCAT started to observe enhanced densities at 110\u2013\n120 km. At approximately this time, the VHF velocity near\nEISCAT (thick yellow line in Fig. 1a) dropped drastically,\nalmost simultaneously with the drop in Jcomp near EISCAT\n(yellow line in Fig. 1c) and the reversal in the F-region HF\nvelocity (780\u20131215 km) although in the latter case it is dif-\nficult to determine the reversal time accurately due to the\npatchiness of F-region HF echoes at 16:30\u201316:44 UT. This\nfeature indicates that the timing error was accounted for with\nan accuracy of 1 min sufficient for the present study as it is\nfully consistent with numerous previous studies that showed\nthat the electric field magnitude is depressed (enhanced) in-\nside (outside) the region of enhanced conductivity (e.g. del\nPozo et al., 2002, and references therein). In our observa-\ntions, the VHF velocity (largely dependent upon the electric\nfield) peaked at 16:33 and 16:46 UT with a sharp drop ob-\nserved in between, that is at the time of the density enhance-\nment apparent in the EISCAT data in Fig. 2a.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2375\/2006\/ Ann.

The light\nblue line is the Doppler velocity mea-\nsured by the STARE radar in the radar\ncell corresponding to a range of 855 km.\nThe vertical line shows the time of den-\nsity enhancement at 16:42 UT from\nFig. 2a.\nAn examination of the equivalent current images obtained\nfrom the interpolated IMAGE data as described above (not\npresented here) shows that a crescent-shaped boundary be-\ntween currents of opposite sign (east- and westward elec-\ntrojets) appeared in the region of interest after 16:30 UT.\nIt then migrated equatorward reaching the Troms\u00f8 location\nat 16:45 UT shortly before it started to retreat poleward\n(16:47 UT). A similar pattern can be recognized in Fig. 1c ex-\ncept for an additional enhancement in Jcomp at farther ranges\n(>950 km) at \u223c16:42 UT, which is simply a consequence of\nthe fact that the projection direction (azimuth of \u201320.1\u25e6) near\nthis particular moment of time happened to be almost tan-\ngential to the north-west pointing part of the crescent-shaped\nboundary. Absorption intensity images obtained in an anal-\nogous fashion from the IRIS data show a sharp increase in\nabsorption at 16:44 UT near EISCAT. These observations\nsuggests that the density enhancement at \u223c16:42 UT can be\nattributed to energetic particle precipitation near the convec-\ntion reversal boundary. One can assume then that the density\nenhancement was quite localized.\n2.3 Relationship between irregularity velocity and ion and\nelectron motions in the E-region\nIn this report we concentrate on the comparison between\nthe l-o-s velocity at VHF and the ion drift velocity compo-\nnent measured simultaneously by the STARE and EISCAT\nradars, respectively. The ion drift velocity component mea-\nsured in the F-region in this experimental configuration acts\nas a proxy for the electron drift velocity in the E-region, Ve0.\nFigure 3 presents a comparison between the STARE Dop-\npler velocity in beam 4, range 855 km (light blue line, the\nsame as reversed yellow line in Fig. 1a) and the component of\nthe EISCAT ion drift velocity resolved along the direction of\nthe STARE beam 4 (azimuth \u201320.9\u25e6) at 278 (red), 115 (dark\nblue line with squares), and 110 km (black line with open\ncircles). To reduce undulations in the ion drifts at 278 km,\nwe also smoothed the EISCAT ion drift variations at 278 km\nusing a 3-point window and we show this variation in Fig. 3\nby the dotted red line.\nOne can notice from Fig. 3 that before\u223c16:30 UT the l-o-s\nvelocity magnitude at VHF was typically smaller or close\nto the ion velocity component at 278 km (red, closed circles\nand dotted line). After 16:30 UT, however, the VHF veloc-\nity was mostly larger in magnitude and\/or opposite in sign\ncompared to V 278i0 . The ion velocity at 115 km (dark blue,\nsquares) was typically larger in magnitude than the VHF ve-\nlocity except for one point near the vertical line. The ion\nvelocity at 110 km (black, open circles), on the other hand,\nwas either close to the VHF velocity (15:30\u201316:00) or some-\nwhat smaller (16:00\u201316:31 UT). Generally, the VHF veloc-\nity was between the two E-region ion drift components, i.e.\nV 110i0 .VVHF.V 115i0 , with the exception of the measurements\nnear 16:45 and 17:35 UT when it was larger and smaller, re-\nspectively, than either of the ion drift components.\nFigure 3 shows that the time variation of the STARE\nDoppler velocity appears to be quite similar to the EISCAT-\ninferred electron motion component (ion drift at 278 km) be-\nfore 16:20 UT (this is more evident in the smoothed data).\nAfter 16:20 UT, however, these two variations differed sig-\nnificantly. Interestingly, for many measurements the VHF\nvelocity was close to that of the ions at 110 km. The EISCAT\nF-region (E-region) ion velocity data in Fig. 2 had 5-min\n(10-min) resolution and \u223c75-s integration period, while the\nSTARE data was integrated over 20-s intervals, and in Fig. 3\nwe have smoothed the VHF velocity using a 3-point sliding\nwindow. Another approach is to post-integrate the STARE\nvelocity using the appropriate intervals and to compare the\nirregularity and ion velocity directly by plotting them against\none another. Figure 4 presents the results of this compari-\nson for the three altitudes of ion velocity measurement. The\nvertical bar for each point indicates the standard deviation\nassociated with the averaging while the horizontal bars show\nthe uncertainty associated with the ion velocity component\n(i.e. the same as the vertical bars in Fig. 3).

The time\n(interval centre) of measurements is indicated near each point.\nused the smoothed EISCAT ion drift data at 278 km.\nIn Fig. 4a, there is considerable scatter and measurements\nafter 16:30 UT generally lie far from the ideal coincidence\nline. Moreover, three points are in the right-bottom quad-\nrant, that is their VHF Doppler velocity was of the opposite\nsign to that of the ions. At 115 km, Fig. 4b, the ion velocity\ncomponent was larger than the VHF velocity (with the ex-\nception of measurements near 16:46 UT). The VHF velocity\nwas predominantly larger in magnitude or close to the ion\nvelocity component at 110 km, Fig. 4c.\nAt both E-region altitudes, the VHF velocity exhibits some\npositive correlation with the ion drift component; the linear\nPearson coefficient computed for the data presented in pan-\nels (b) and (c) are 0.45 and 0.49, respectively. The corre-\nlation coefficient is much smaller for the data in panel (a)\n(only 0.12). If one excludes from the correlation analysis the\ndata near the density enhancement at 16:42 UT (at 16:46 and\n16:41 UT in panels (b) and (c), respectively), the correlations\nat 115 and 110 km are quite substantial, viz. 0.80 and 0.79,\nrespectively, whereas at 278 km it is only 0.44 even when\nas many as three points (at 16:35, 16:40, 16:45 UT) are ex-\ncluded. Correlation in panel (a) improves significantly if one\nincludes only the points before 16:30 UT, viz. 0.61.\n3 Discussion\nIn our observations, the electron drift velocity vector was\ndirected at an azimuth of 90\u25e6\u2013130\u25e6 W as inferred from the\nEISCAT tristatic measurements of the ion drift velocity at\n278 km, CUTLASS measurements of HF Doppler velocity\nin the F-region, and IMAGE magnetometer records, Fig. 2c.\nGiven the azimuth of the STARE beam 4 (20.9\u25e6 W), our mea-\nsurements of the Doppler velocity at VHF almost certainly\nrefer to observations outside the instability cone. Indeed, our\nestimates of the azimuthal extent of the primary F-B instabil-\nity cone (blue bars centered on the electron velocity azimuth\nin Fig. 2c show that the instability cone might have reached\nthe azimuth range of interest (\u201320.9\u25e6) for only one measure-\nment (\u223c16:20 UT). For all other measurements, it is rather\nunlikely that we observed the primary, in-cone irregularities.\nThe experiment configuration employed in this study thus al-\nlows us to investigate irregularity velocity at large flow an-\ngles, outside the primary instability cone in the context of\nthe electron and ion background motions.\nFollowing previous STARE\/EISCAT studies (e.g. Kofman\nand Nielsen, 1990; Kustov and Haldoupis, 1992; Koustov\net al., 2002; Uspensky et al., 2003, 2004) we compared the\nelectron drift velocity component Ve0 cos \u03b8 and the l-o-s ve-\nlocity measured with the VHF radar, VVHF los, Figs. 3 and\n4a. Both line and scatter plots show that the l-o-s velocity at\nVHF represents the electron drift velocity component rather\npoorly.\nIn Fig. 4a, the majority of points were either close to or\nabove the dashed line of ideal coincidence (for the same\nsign), that is their VHF velocity was smaller than the E\u00d7B\ndrift velocity component. Koustov et al. (2002) have at-\ntributed significantly smaller STARE Finland velocity mag-\nnitudes, as compared to those of E\u00d7B drift velocity compo-\nnent, to the phase velocity attenuation with the aspect angle\n(Ogawa et al., 1980; Nielsen, 1986; Kustov et al., 1994) since\nthe aspect angles near the EISCAT FoV for the STARE Fin-\nland observations have been estimated to be of the order of\n\u20131\u25e6. In addition, for a few points in Fig. 4a velocities were of\nthe opposite sign. This result is somewhat surprising as the\nvelocity sense at VHF is expected to agree with that of the\nE\u00d7B drift even if the magnitude is reduced due to the aspect\nangle effects. Good agreement between the senses of veloc-\nity measured directly with the STARE Finland radar and that\ninferred from the tristatic measurements with the EISCAT\nradar has also been shown experimentally (e.g. Kofman and\nNielsen, 1990; Kustov and Haldoupis, 1992).\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2375\/2006\/ Ann.

Comparison between the\nE\u00d7B plasma drift components as in-\nferred from various techniques. The\ngreen squares and black dots (yellow\ndots) represent the F-region velocity\nmeasured by the CUTLASS Finland\nradar in ranges 870\u2013915 km and 1005\u2013\n1050 km, respectively (inferred from\nthe cosine fitting to all F-region veloci-\nties). The thin dark (heavy) blue line is\nthe reversed equivalent current compo-\nnent at Troms\u00f8 (Kilpisja\u00a8rvi).\nIn Fig. 2b, we showed that after \u223c16:30 UT variation\nin the EISCAT ion drift magnitude at 278 km was similar\nto those at 110 and 115 km as well as to variation in the\nequivalent currents (with exception of measurements near\n16:42 UT), which suggests that the EISCAT ion drift data\nat 278 km was of reasonable quality. To provide addi-\ntional evidence that the EISCAT ion drift data at 278 km is\nan appropriate proxy for the electron drift velocity in the\nE-region, in Fig. 5 we compare the EISCAT ion drift com-\nponent at 278 km (both unsmoothed data shown by the red\nline and closed circles and 3-point smoothed data shown\nby the dotted line) with several other estimates of the E\u00d7B\nplasma drift component: (1) CUTLASS Doppler velocity\nmeasurements in beam 5, ranges 870\u2013915 km (green squares,\nVHF los 885 km); (2) as for (1) but at ranges 1005\u20131050 km\n(black dots, VHF los 1020 km); (3) the averaged fitted HF ve-\nlocity component in the F-region (yellow dots, VHF fit comp);\nand the reversed equivalent current component (4) at Troms\u00f8\n(thin dark blue line, \u2212Jcomp TRO) and (5) at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\n(heavy blue line,\u2212Jcomp KIL). The estimates (3) and (4) have\nbeen obtained by simply projecting the two-dimensional vec-\ntors (yellow dots and dotted black lines, respectively) from\nFigs. 2b and c onto the STARE beam 4 direction. The es-\ntimate (5) is analogous to (4) except that the magnetometer\nrecords at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi were considered.\nOne should note that the location of the HF backscatter (in\nterms of slant range) is seldom known accurately. A stan-\ndard range-finding algorithm assumes a straight line prop-\nagation to a specific height (similar to a VHF coherent sys-\ntem), which for our observations gives a range of 885 km (for\nEISCAT F-region FoV, 69.0\u25e6 N, 19.1\u25e6 E, 300 km). Propaga-\ntion effects, such as ray bending, however, are significantly\nmore important for HF observations, and generally cannot\nbe ignored. Yeoman et al. (2001) showed that in their ob-\nservations at \u223c19.5 MHz an uncertainty associated with the\nselection of the range gate in 1\/2-hop propagation mode to\nTroms\u00f8 slightly exceeded the range gate length in Myopic\nmode (15 km) and in Fig. 5 we considered three range gates\n870, 885, and 900 km (870\u2013915 km).\nThere were two intervals during which the CUTLASS Fin-\nland radar observed echoes in those ranges in beam 5 (green\nsquares in Fig. 5): near 16 and 17 UT. For the first interval\nthe HF velocity was of the same sign (being\u223c20% smaller in\nmagnitude) as the ion drift component while for the second\ninterval it was of opposite sign (except for a few points near\n17:15 UT). The fitted HF F-region velocity component (yel-\nlow) utilizing measurements in all CUTLASS beams shows a\nsomewhat different trend; it was negative and close to the HF\nl-o-s velocity at 885 km before 16:40 UT but more consistent\nwith the ion drift component near 17:05 UT when both were\npositive.\nThe change in the F-region HF velocity sign and a velocity\nmagnitude increase with slant range is obvious in Fig. 1b so\nthat one can expect a better match between the EISCAT and\nCUTLASS measurements assuming some bending of the HF\nbeam and hence larger slant ranges used for comparison. A\ndecrease of the equivalent current component Jcomp with dis-\ntance from the radar can be also recognized in Fig. 1c and\nhence one can attempt to put both EISCAT and CUTLASS\nvelocity measurements into the context of the equivalent cur-\nrent component near the EISCAT viewing area. Interestingly,\nHF l-o-s velocity at 885 km represents reasonably well the\nKIL current component (green squares are near the heavy\nblue line) after 17:00 UT, even though the straight line prop-\nagation distance between the radar site and the KIL magne-\ntometer (when its position is projected along the magnetic\nfield line from 110 to 300 km) is only around 825 km. A\nsimilar comparison between the HF l-o-s velocity at 1020 km\nand the TRO current component also shows good agreement\n(straight line distance in this case is \u223c920 km). The EISCAT\nvelocity component is between \u2212Jcomp KIL and \u2212Jcomp TRO\n(VHF los 885 km and VHF los 1020 km) near 17:00 UT, which in-\ndicates that HF echoes near EISCAT originated from some-\nwhere between these ranges, 885\u20131020 km. This uncertainty\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 2375\u20132389, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2375\/2006\/\nR. A. Makarevich et al.: Comparison of irregularity and ion drift velocities in the E-region 2383\nin range is somewhat larger than that reported previously for\na radar frequency of 19.5 MHz (Yeoman et al., 2001) but is\nconsistent with more recent results of Yeoman et al. (2005)\nfor lower frequencies for which the refraction effects are ex-\npected to be more significant.\nIdeally, to resolve the issue of the location of the HF\nechoes one needs to perform ray-tracing simulations using\nthe electron density measurements along the HF radar beam.\nUnfortunately, no such measurements were available except\nfor the Troms\u00f8 location, Fig. 2a, which is quite far from the\nregion of interest (ranges 300\u2013700 km) so that the results of\nany ray-tracing simulation would be applicable only if the\nhorizontal density distribution were homogeneous. In an at-\ntempt to address the problem, a series of ray-tracing simula-\ntions using standard CUTLASS software based on the orig-\ninal code developed by Jones and Stephenson (1975) that\nimplements Haselgrove (1963) method has been performed\nusing the representative frequency of 10 MHz of channel A\nand EISCAT density profiles at 16:30\u201316:35, 16:38\u201316:40,\n16:53\u201316:57, 17:03\u201317:06, and 17:13\u201317:16 UT, as well as\nthe generic profile from the International Reference Iono-\nsphere (IRI) model (Bilitza, 2001) appropriate for the time\n(27 March 2004, 16:30 UT) and location of the measure-\nments (to be consistent with other simulations in series the\nTroms\u00f8 location, 69.0\u25e6 N, 19.1\u25e6 E, has been selected). The\nresults, however, indicate that the observed features, such as\nlocation of the E- and F-region backscatter and ground scat-\nter are not reproduced adequately by any of the simulations,\nwhich most likely signifies that the lower portion of the iono-\nsphere was not quite homogeneous. This conclusion is to\nsome extent supported by the Sodankyla\u00a8 ionosonde observa-\ntions that show the E-region critical frequency f0E substan-\ntially smaller than the F-region critical frequencies f0F1 and\nf0F2, whereas EISCAT observed the E-region to be stronger\nand comparable to the F-region after 16:00 UT, Fig. 2a.\nBy taking everything into account, one can conclude that\neven though our best efforts to pinpoint the location of HF\nechoes was largely unsuccessful, the EISCAT data on the\nelectron motions in the E-region, when placed in a context of\nCUTLASS and IMAGE measurements, appear to be of rea-\nsonable quality. Moreover, as we argue further in Sect. 3.1,\nseveral important features recognizable in the electron mo-\ntion data can be explained reasonably well and are consistent\nwith previous studies. Furthermore, the interpretation below\nis also supported by the EISCAT data on the ion motions at\n110 km that had an integration time almost twice as large.\nThe other issue that also needs to be discussed is the qual-\nity of the STARE data. As we noted earlier, on a few occa-\nsions EISCAT and STARE velocities were of opposite sign.\nUspensky et al. (2004) presented the STARE\/EISCAT data\nshowing that when the STARE SNR was very low (\u223c0 dB)\nthe VHF velocity was of opposite sign to that of the E\u00d7B\ndrift component (see their Fig. 2). This observation has been\nused later by Makarevitch et al. (2004b) in an attempt to ex-\nplain the STARE velocities measured near the poleward edge\nof the VHF echo band that were not consistent with the di-\nrection of the plasma flow. In our observations, however,\nthe power of STARE Finland echoes from near EISCAT (not\nshown here) was above 3 dB and typically between 8 and\n30 dB. In this situation, we believe, other effect(s) could be\nimportant.\n3.1 E-region irregularity velocity and ion motions\nMoorcroft (1996) suggested that when E-region irregulari-\nties propagate at large flow angles, i.e. nearly perpendicular\nto the plasma flow, they can move with a velocity that is sig-\nnificantly different from that of the electron motion compo-\nnent and close to that of the ions. This idea has been used\nto explain an asymmetry of the velocity variation with the\nflow angle with respect to 90\u25e6 observed with the Homer UHF\nradar.\nAccording to the linear fluid theory of electrojet irregular-\nities (e.g., Fejer and Kelley, 1980), the phase velocity at a\ndirection of wave propagation vector k\u02c6 \u2261k \/k is given by\nV = k\u02c6 \u00b7 Vd\n1+9 + k\u02c6 \u00b7 Vi0, (1)\nwhere Vd\u2261Ve0\u2212Vi0, and 9 is a function of aspect angle\n\u03b1, collision frequencies of ions and electrons with neutrals\n(\u03bdi, \u03bde) and ion and electron gyro frequencies (i, e):\n9 = \u03bde\u03bdi\nei\n(cos2 \u03b1 + \n2\ne\n\u03bd2e\nsin2 \u03b1). (2)\nIf the first term in Eq. (1) is small the phase velocity is deter-\nmined by the second term and hence would be representative\nof the ion drift velocity component along k\u02c6 and independent\nof the aspect angle. This argument has been employed by\nMakarevitch et al. (2002) in order to explain an absence of\nvelocity variation with slant range (and hence aspect angle)\nfor certain directions as seen by the Prince George Super-\nDARN HF radar.\nThe above argument would be valid, however, only for the\nrelatively small range of flow angle near perpendicularity to\nVd if perfect aspect angle conditions (\u03b1=0) are assumed. Us-\npensky et al. (2003) proposed that non-orthogonality of the\nscatter coupled with the ion motions could play a crucial role\nin modifying the phase velocity of E-region irregularities as\nit essentially widens the range of the flow angles for which\nthe ion motions dominate since 9 grows rapidly with the as-\npect angle \u03b1, Eq. (2), thus reducing the first term in Eq. (1).\nEven though in the Uspensky et al. (2003) observations the\nSTARE Finland velocity and EISCAT convection component\nwere of the same sign, it was argued that it is possible for\nthem to have different sign (see their Figs. 8 and 9), an im-\nportant prediction in the context of the present study. Milan\net al. (2004) argued that if the aspect angles are very large\n(>3\u25e6) the range widens even more, reaching small flow an-\ngles within the instability cone. Again, the prediction was\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2375\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 2375\u20132389, 2006\n2384 R. A. Makarevich et al.: Comparison of irregularity and ion drift velocities in the E-region\nthat the l-o-s velocity sense can be opposite to that of the\nelectron drift, which was supported by the observations with\nthe CUTLASS Iceland radar at very short ranges (<400 km).\nLater Makarevitch et al. (2004a) have considered the varia-\ntion of the l-o-s velocity as measured by the CUTLASS Fin-\nland radar in the near FoV (range <1215 km) and demon-\nstrated that velocities of opposite sign occur for a range of\nflow angles.\nThe principal difference between this and the previous\nstudies is that in addition to ion velocity measurements in the\nF-region we also have information on the ion motions in the\nE-region. This was achieved by varying the EISCAT tristatic\naltitude in a manner similar to that reported by Davies et al.\n(1997) who used the ion velocities at 6 E- and 1 F-region\nheights to estimate the ion-neutral collision frequencies in the\nE-region. In the present study, we compare for the first time\nthe E-region Doppler velocity measured with STARE and the\nion drift velocity component from EISCAT measurements in\norder to test the previously proposed hypothesis concerning\nthe importance of the ion motion.\nThe comparisons showed that the STARE velocity was\nroughly between the ion velocity components measured at\n110 and 115 km, with exception of the measurements near\nthe time when a large density enhancement was observed by\nEISCAT, 16:40\u201317:00 UT. Importantly, this was also near\nthe interval when the STARE velocity exceeded the elec-\ntron velocity component, Fig. 3. Uspensky et al. (2003) have\ntermed this feature \u201cvelocity overspeed\u201d and attributed it to\nan increase in effective backscatter height. They argued that\nwhen observing a certain radar cell, the radar integrates over\na range of E-region heights, and due to the height variation of\nthe scattering cross-section the bulk of the backscatter power\ncomes from a certain altitude, determined by altitude pro-\nfiles of the density and aspect angle. As the density profile\nchanges with time so does the effective height of backscat-\nter. In the E-region top side (115\u2013120 km) the ion drifts are\nmuch greater than at the peak (105\u2013110 km) and hence the\nion motion contribution to the E-region irregularity velocity\nis greatly enhanced as well.\nThe VHF velocity was slightly smaller than the ion ve-\nlocity component at 110 km V 110i0 in the beginning of the\ninterval of interest but later on became larger and even ap-\nproached and exceeded V 115i0 near the density enhancement at\n16:42 UT, while being significantly different (larger in mag-\nnitude and even of the opposite sign) from Ve0 at the same\ntime. These facts suggest that this variability could be re-\nlated to the changes in the electron density profile.\nTo test this idea we present the EISCAT electron density in\nthe E-region, Fig. 6a, together with the velocity comparison\nshown in Fig. 3. The maximum density height hmax between\n95 and 125 km is shown in panel (a) by the yellow dots. In\ncases when the electron density data was available on both\nsides of the maximum the height hmax was taken as the max-\nimum of the parabolic function fitted to the three points. Un-\nfortunately, the patchiness of the electron density data below\n110 km does not allow us to estimate the effective backscat-\nter height heff for the entire duration of the event with 75-s\nresolution. To overcome this by improving the data statis-\ntics and to match the resolution with that of STARE we have\nreanalyzed the EISCAT Troms\u00f8 data using 20-s integration\nintervals. These 20-s data sets were used further to estimate\nthe effective height heff using a technique described in de-\ntail by Uspensky et al. (2003, 2004). The effective height\nestimates are shown by the red circles (20-s values) and hori-\nzontal lines (10-min averaged values shown if the number of\npoints exceeded 5). The density profiles that had more than\ntwo missing data points (grey cells in Fig. 6) below 110 km or\na missing data point just below 110 km were not considered.\nThe remaining data gaps were filled by linear interpolation.\nFigure 6 shows that before \u223c16:00 UT the E-region elec-\ntron density was small and slightly increasing with altitude\n(the same feature is also evident in Fig. 2a). The STARE\nvelocity was slightly less or comparable to V 110i0 while the\neffective height exhibited large scatter between 105\u2013113 km\nbut, on average, was below 111 km. After \u223c16:00 UT the\nsituation changes; a distinct E-region maximum appeared in\nthe density profiles around 112 km, heff was generally above\n110 km and, on average, around 113 km; the VHF velocity\nwas between V 110i0 and V\n115\ni0 and agreed well with Ve0 (ex-\ncept for one measurement at 16:21 UT that might have been\ninside the instability cone, as we argued earlier). At 16:30\u2013\n16:40 UT, the spread in hmax becomes slightly larger and the\nmean heff reaches an absolute maximum of 113 km, the VHF\nvelocity is larger than Ve0 in magnitude and slightly less than\nV 115i0 . In the next 10-min interval, during which a density en-\nhancement occurred, heff showed strong fluctuations, while\nhmax was typically above 125 km. At 16:50\u201317:00 UT, heff\nwas also variable peaking at \u223c16:55 UT near the time when\nEISCAT showed positive Ve0\u223c 300 m\/s. Between 17:15 and\n17:35 UT, heff was decreasing towards the end of the inter-\nval. The STARE velocity magnitude starts close to or slightly\nabove V 110i0 ending at somewhat lower values.\nOne can conclude that the timing of the changes in\nthe relationship between irregularity and ion drift velocity\n(\u223c16:00, 16:30 UT) appears to be associated with the change\nin the density distribution and that the idea that an overspeed\ninterval at 16:30\u201316:50 UT is associated with the uplifting\nof the E-region is to some extent supported by the electron\ndensity data as both maximum density and (less clearly) ef-\nfective backscatter height showed an increase at this time.\nThe latter result thus supports previous findings by Uspen-\nsky et al. (2003). A new result with respect to irregular-\nity and electron velocity is that we report not just velocity\noverspeed but also several cases of opposite velocity sign.\nAlthough envisaged earlier, it is instructive to establish ex-\nperimentally. One should note though that opposite signs\nwere observed only in few cases so the result is perhaps not\nvery conclusive. However, additional support for this point\ncomes from a reanalysis of the EISCAT remote site data from\n16:30 to 17:00 UT using a 20-s integration. We found that\nAnn.

Panel (a) shows the EISCAT density data between 100\u2013135 km at 20-s resolution. Colour scheme is indicated on the right. Grey cells\nrepresent missing data. The yellow (red) dots are the maximum density (effective backscatter) height between 95 and 125 km. The horizontal\nwhite lines are 10-min averaged effective heights. Panel (b) is the same as Fig. 3.\nthe tristatic velocity component consistently showed positive\nvelocities of larger magnitudes than the uncertainty of the\nmeasurements near 16:45 and 16:55 UT, with larger spread\nand both negative and positive velocities near 16:35 UT. The\nlatter result combined with the noted earlier observation that\nthe CUTLASS velocities were also positive near 16:45 UT\n(albeit not exactly at the EISCAT location), makes it rather\nunlikely that the opposite signs were simply the result of the\nlow data quality.\nThe other new result of the present study is that the VHF\nvelocity was \u201climited\u201d by the ion velocity components at 110\nand 115 km. From Fig. 4, the VHF velocity magnitude was\nabove the ion drift component V 115i0 only once, namely at\n16:46 UT, near the time of the density enhancement. Simi-\nlarly, it was well below V 110i0 only once, at 17:32 UT when\nthe effective height was below 110 km. If one assumes that\nthe backscatter height varies slightly with time in a range\n105\u2013115 km (as both previous estimates by Uspensky et al.\n(2003) and our own estimates of heff suggest), one can in-\nterpret this observation as indicating that there will be agree-\nment between the VHF velocity and the ions drift component\nat a height within the 105 to 115 km range, with the height\nat which the agreement occurs depending upon the electron\ndensity profile.\nAccording to this interpretation, agreement between the\nVHF velocity and the ion velocity component at 110 km be-\nfore 16:00 UT was observed simply because the bulk of the\nbackscatter signal came from around this altitude, which re-\nsulted in the observed closeness between VVHF los and V 110i0 .\nThe estimates of heff that we performed generally support\nthis notion as on average they were close to 110 km. More-\nover, the VHF velocity was smaller than V 110i0 in magni-\ntude during the intervals when heff was below 111 km (e.g.,\n15:50\u201316:00 UT or 17:30\u201317:40 UT). In general, the varia-\ntion of the VHF velocity in Fig. 6b with respect to V 110i0 and\nV 115i0 appears to be consistent with this variation of effective\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2375\/2006\/ Ann.

For\neach EISCAT measurement with integration interval (t1, t2),\nan appropriate interval over which to average the effective\nheight was determined as (t1\u2212\u03b4, t2+\u03b4), where \u03b4 was taken as\n(a) 4 min and (b) 0 s. The same interval (t1, t2) was used for\naveraging the VHF velocity averaging in Figs. 4c and 7. The\nvertical bars in Fig. 7 represent standard deviations due to the\naveraging of VHF velocity (the same as the vertical bars in\nFig. 4c) plus uncertainties in V 110i0 (the same as the horizontal\nbars in Fig. 4c) while the horizontal bars are standard devi-\nations due to the averaging of effective height values from\nFig. 6a. In this way, Fig. 7a features the effective height es-\ntimates similar to those presented in Fig. 6a by white lines\n(also \u223c10-min intervals since t2\u2212t1.150 s at h0=110 km,\nbut centered at the time of the EISCAT velocity measure-\nments), whereas Fig. 7b shows averaged values using the\nintervals matched exactly with EISCAT and STARE veloc-\nity post-integration intervals of Fig. 4c. Similar to Fig. 6a,\nFig. 7a shows only those points for which the number of 20-s\neffective height values used in the averaging exceeded 5. De-\nspite the difference in approach, both diagrams show a sim-\nilar pattern: a general increase of VHF velocity as a func-\ntion of effective height where both variables were counted\nfrom the reference level at a specific height of 110 km. The\nlinear Pearson correlation coefficients between the variables\nin panels (a) and (b) are 0.73 and 0.76, respectively. The\nmore thorough analysis of Fig. 7 thus confirms our conclu-\nsion based on Fig. 6, namely that the VHF velocity variation\nappears to be consistent with that of the effective backscatter\nheight.\n3.2 E-region irregularity velocity: relative importance of\nelectron and ion motions\nThe observations presented in this report suggest that the E-\nregion irregularity velocity at large flow angles may represent\nthe ion velocity component at an altitude that varies between\n108\u2013114 km depending on the electron density profile. This\nresult is different from those of the classical studies of the\n1980s that demonstrated good agreement between irregular-\nity and electron drift velocities in the E-region (Nielsen and\nSchlegel, 1983, 1985; Kofman and Nielsen, 1990) as well as\nfrom those of more recent studies that proposed that the ion\ndrift motion should be taken into account (Uspensky et al.,\n2003, 2004; Makarevitch et al., 2004a).\nIt might be possible to reconcile these results by as-\nsuming that both the ion drift velocity and its coupling to\nthe irregularity phase velocity varies from one set of ob-\nservations to another. In our observations near equinox\nand during daytime, the ion drift velocity was relatively\nlarge; V 110i0 \u223cV 278i0 \/4, V 115i0 \u223cV 278i0 \/2, Fig. 2b. This re-\nsult is consistent with the estimate of the ion drift ve-\nlocity based on the collision frequencies calculated us-\ning the expressions given by Schunk and Nagy (1980)\nand the neutral densities taken from the MSISE-90 model\nrun for the specific time and location of our obser-\nvations (69.0\u25e6 N, 19.1\u25e6 E, 27 March 2004, 16:30 UT).\nAt 110 km, the ion-neutral collision frequency \u03bdin is\n627 s\u22121 and V 110i0 \u223ci\/\u03bdinVe0\u223c=0.29Ve0, where i\u223c=180 s\u22121\nis the ion gyrofrequency. At 115 km, \u03bdin=329 s\u22121 and\nV 115i0\n\u223c=0.55Ve0. This result is also consistent with the find-\nings by Davies et al. (1997) who employed the ion drift\nvelocity measurements at several heights to derive the nor-\nmalised collision frequency, \u03bdin\/i=((E\/B)2\/V 2i0\u22121)1\/2\nto be of the order of 3.7 at 109 km, and hence obtained\nV 109i0 =(3.72+1)\u22121\/2 Ve0\u223c=0.26Ve0 for similar conditions on\n3 April 1992, 10:00\u201315:00 UT.\nWhen considered in the context of the E-region irregular-\nity velocity the ion drifts are usually neglected (a fair approx-\nimation for observations at small flow and aspect angles) or\nestimated for a specific height using generic collision fre-\nquencies (e.g. Milan et al., 2004; Makarevitch et al., 2004a).\nOne could argue that, depending on conditions (in particu-\nlar the solar cycle period, season, and time of observations),\nthe collision frequency can vary considerably and so can the\nion drift velocity. For example, both our measurements and\nthose of Davies et al. (1997) refer to the descending phase\nof the solar cycle. When solar activity is larger one can ex-\npect larger collision frequencies and smaller ion drifts. In-\ndeed, the MSISE-90 model gives \u03bdin=671 s\u22121 at 110 km for\n27 March 2000, 16:30 UT, and a corresponding 7% reduction\nin the ion drift velocity, V 110i0 \u223c=0.27Ve0. Similar estimates for\nnighttime conditions (27 March 2000, 01:30 UT) give a fur-\nther 15% reduction in the ion drift velocity as compared to\nthe daytime conditions, V 110i0 \u223c=0.23Ve0.\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 2375\u20132389, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2375\/2006\/\nR. A. Makarevich et al.: Comparison of irregularity and ion drift velocities in the E-region 2387\nAnother important factor can be the backscatter height, as\nwe argued following the idea of Uspensky et al. (2003). Fi-\nnally, the \u201ccoupling function\u201d 9 will differ for different sets\nof conditions as it depends upon the aspect angle (which ac-\ncording to Uspensky et al. (2003) depends upon the density\nprofile as does the backscatter height) and collision frequen-\ncies. The electron collision frequency \u03bde can also depend\nindirectly on the electric field intensity due to electron scat-\ntering by the unstable F-B waves which effectively results\nin enhanced \u201canomalous\u201d collision frequencies \u03bd\u2217e (Sudan,\n1983; Robinson, 1986; Robinson and Honary, 1990). Thus,\nthe results of the present study indicating that E-region irreg-\nularity velocity Vlos may represent the ion velocity, Vi0, at\nlarge flow angles do not necessarily contradict the previous\nfindings that demonstrated either an agreement between Vlos\nand Ve0 (e.g. Kofman and Nielsen, 1990) or the agreement\nbetween Vlos and a combination of Ve0 and Vi0 (e.g. Uspen-\nsky et al., 2003).\nFinally, during the first half of the interval under study the\nirregularity velocity exhibited much larger positive correla-\ntion with the electron drift component than that for the entire\ndataset (0.61 versus 0.12). This suggests that relative impor-\ntance of electron and ion drifts could differ even for one set of\nobservations. Moreover, according to Eq. (1) one can expect\nthe ion drift component to dominate over that of the elec-\ntrons when the latter is small (when the flow angle is close\nto 90\u25e6). Interestingly enough, from Fig. 2c, the flow angles\nwere closer to 90\u25e6 after \u223c16:30 UT when the electron drifts\nwere oriented at \u223c110\u25e6\u2013120\u25e6 West of North while STARE\nobservations were performed at 20.9\u25e6 (also W of N), that is\nexactly when the largest disagreements between irregularity\nand electron drift velocities were observed (including oppo-\nsite signs). It is thus entirely feasible that if the ion drift\n\u201ccoupling function\u201d is relatively small, variation in the flow\nangle would strongly affect the E-region irregularity velocity.\n3.3 E-region irregularity generation at large flow and aspect\nangles\nIn this study we concentrated on the phase velocity of\nE-region irregularities at large flow angles. The results pre-\nsented suggest that the Doppler velocity measurements re-\nfer to observations at large aspect angles as well. In other\nwords, we are dealing with irregularities propagating outside\nboth the flow and aspect cones where the generation of irreg-\nularities in the linear regime is prohibited. Nonlinear theories\nhave been invoked in the past in order to explain plasma wave\ngeneration at large flow (Sudan et al., 1973) and aspect an-\ngles (e.g. Hamza and St-Maurice, 1995). Of special interest\nfor this study is the recent work by Drexler and St.-Maurice\n(2005) who proposed that what appears as large aspect an-\ngle echoes in the HF radar data (Milan et al., 2004) can in\nfact be successfully interpreted using the nonlocal formula-\ntion of Drexler et al. (2002). Furthermore, Drexler and St.-\nMaurice (2005) have derived a formula for the phase velocity\n(rather than simply adopting the one from the linear theory)\nthat only contains the ion drift term, thus providing a theo-\nretical basis for the interpretation used in Milan et al. (2004).\nEven though the nonlocal theory of Drexler et al. (2002) and\nDrexler and St.-Maurice (2005) strictly speaking applies only\nto small flow angles, it provides additional insights as to why\nirregularities at large flow and aspect angles are observed at\nall as well as why their Doppler velocities appear to be close\nto that of the ion motion in the E-region.\nIf one assumes that the waves outside the flow angle in-\nstability cone are generated through the nonlinear cascade\nfrom the linearly unstable, small flow angle modes (Su-\ndan et al., 1973), then significant modification of the lin-\near phase velocity, Eq. (1), can occur. Based on 30-MHz\nimaging radar observations in conjunction with in situ elec-\ntric field measurements, Bahcivan et al. (2005) proposed that\nthe phase velocity outside the flow angle cone is better de-\nscribed by the cosine component of the ion acoustic speed,\nCs cos \u03b8 , than by the more often cited plasma drift compo-\nnent, Vd cos \u03b8 . The ion acoustic speed was taken from the\nempirical formula derived by Nielsen and Schlegel (1985)\nwith the electric field magnitude as an input parameter. In\nour experiment the tristatic EISCAT system provided both\nelectric field and temperature measurements allowing us to\ncheck whether the STARE l-o-s velocity was close to the\nprediction based on the Cs cos \u03b8 formula. The ion acous-\ntic speed was calculated using the measured ion and elec-\ntron temperatures as in the previous calculation of flow an-\ngles shown in Fig. 2c. The results of this analysis showed\nthat, indeed, for observations before \u223c16:20 UT, the agree-\nment between Vlos and Cs cos \u03b8 was better (than that between\nVlos and Vd cos \u03b8 ). After \u223c16:20 UT, however, no signifi-\ncant improvement was observed, as one would expect for an\n\u201coverspeed\u201d case, i.e. Vlos>Vd cos \u03b8 , with substitution of Vd\nby Cs<Vd generally making the agreement worse. Varia-\ntion of the assumed height (we repeated Cs calculations for\n110, 115, and 120 km) only resulted in very small changes\nin the Cs component meaning that variation with altitude is\nunlikely to account for large differences between Vlos and\nCs cos \u03b8 when Vlos>Vd cos \u03b8 .\nThe present study provides an alternative view on the\nphase velocity at large flow angles to that proposed in Bahci-\nvan et al. (2005) as we consider the ion drift rather than the\nion acoustic speed to be important for Doppler observations\nat large flow angles. It is not clear why exactly the Cs cos \u03b8\nidea fails in the \u201coverspeed\u201d case nor whether these two ideas\ncould be reconciled. To resolve these issues as well as the is-\nsue of the relative importance of the electron and ion motions\nin determining the E-region irregularity velocity one needs\nsimultaneous and continuous data on the ion and electron\nmotions and temperatures in the E-region.

Makarevich et al.: Comparison of irregularity and ion drift velocities in the E-region\nthe E-region irregularity velocity is a first step in this direc-\ntion.\n4 Conclusions\nA comparison of the line-of-sight Doppler velocity measured\nby the STARE Finland VHF radar at large flow angles with\nthe ion and electron drift velocity components inferred from\nthe EISCAT tristatic observations of the ion motions in the\nE and F-regions, respectively, shows that the STARE ve-\nlocity is close to the ion drift velocity component in the E-\nregion (110\u2013115 km), whereas correlation with the electron\ndrift component is low at the largest flow angles and near sig-\nnificant enhancements in the E-region electron density. This\nsuggests that the E-region irregularity velocity at large flow\nangles may represent the ion velocity component at an alti-\ntude determined by the plasma density altitude profile.\nThe results of the first comparison between the irregular-\nity and ion drift velocity measurements in the E-region pre-\nsented in this study provide direct support to recent studies\nthat found reasonable agreement between the measured and\nestimated velocity under the assumption that the ion drifts\nshould be taken into account, but the results also suggest that\nthe ion motion may play a greater role in the phase velocity\nof E-region irregularities than previously thought.\nAcknowledgements.
