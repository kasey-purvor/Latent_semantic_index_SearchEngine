In the context of increasing competition for home-based and overseas students \nhigher educational institutions now recognise that they need to market themselves in a \nclimate of international competition.   \nThis paper presents the results of a systematic review of the literature on higher \neducation marketing.  The objectives of the review were to: systematically collect, \ndocument, scrutinise and critically analyse the current research literature on supply-\nside higher education marketing; to establish the scope of higher education marketing; \nto identify gaps in the research literature, and make recommendations for further \nresearch in this field.   \nThe paper commences by summarising the marketisation of higher education \nglobally, and follows with a short summary of the emergence of research in the \nmarketing of HE in this new global marketplace.  A summary of the method used for \nselecting and reviewing the literature follows, with details of the search strategy and \nparameters of the review.   The key objectives which underpinned this systematic \nreview are set out followed by a thematic analysis of the findings from the review to \nestablish the current state of research in HE sector marketing.  The final section \n 4\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I.

The authors conclude, however, \nthat the research field of higher education marketing is still at a relatively pioneer \nstage with much research still to be carried out both from an exploratory and strategic \nperspective. \nInternationalisation and globalisation \nIn recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the governance of the higher \neducation (HE) system throughout the world and marketisation policies and market-\ntype mechanisms have been introduced in countries previously characterised by a \nhigh degree of government control (Jongbloed, 2003). In most countries, \nmarketisation has been viewed as a \u201ccompromise between privatisation, academic \nautonomy and state control\u201d (Young, 2002, p.79) as established leaders throughout \nthe world called for \u201cfreedom from all the shackles of government regulation\u201d (Dill, \n2003 p.136).        \nThe literature indicates that the higher education market is now well established as a \nglobal phenomenon, especially in the major-English speaking nations: Canada, the \nUS, Australia and the UK (Binsardi & Ekwulugo, 2003) and the literature provides \nevidence of marketisation and the deregulation of universities in the US (Allen & \nShen, 1999; Dill, 2003) Canada (Kwong, 2000; Young, 2002) the UK (Middleton, \n1996; Williams, 1997; Gibbs, 2001; Taylor, 2003) Australia (Baldwin & James, 2000) \nand New Zealand (Ford et al., 1999).   However, governments have also turned to \nderegulatory policies in Japan (Arimoto, 1997), Russia (Hare & Lugachev, 1999) the \nEastern Bloc (Czarniawska & Genell, 2002), Holland (Jongbloed, 2003), Spain \n 5\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \n(Mora, 1997), Israel (Oplatka, 2002) China (Williams et al., 1997; Mok, 1999; Mok, \n2000), Asia (Gray et al., 2003) and Africa (Ivy, 2001; Maringe & Foskett, 2002; \nMaringe, 2004).  \nIn response to these changes, the value, effectiveness and potential benefits of using \nmarketing theories and concepts, which have been effective in the business world, are \ngradually now being applied by many universities: with a view to gaining a \ncompetitive edge, and gaining a larger share of the international market.  In light of \nthis, the authors recognise that there is considerable debate surrounding the \nmarketisation of Higher Education internationally (particularly in the major English \nspeaking countries), and the political arguments and ethical concerns surrounding this \nmajor paradigm shift are ongoing.   The primary purpose of this paper, however, was \nto identify, summarise and analyse the key literature in this field which focuses on the \nmarketing of HE internationally, rather than to pursue further the questions regarding \nthe political, economic and ethical basis for privatisation, marketisation and \ncustomisation of higher education worldwide, and its implications. It is not, therefore, \nthe intention of the authors to take a stance in this debate, but to act as \u201cbeholders\u201d, \nreviewing the current research evidence on the marketing of HE. \nThe elements of globalization in higher education are widespread and multifaceted: it \nhas been estimated that more than 1.6 million students study outside of their home \ncountries, with more than 547,000 studying in the United States (Pimpa, 2003).  The \nissues and implications of the global marketisation of higher education and \nprivatisation (Arimoto, 1997; Kwong, 2000) have been discussed in the context of a \nnumber of key concerns: problems of increasing competition between institutions, \nnationally and internationally, (Conway et al., 1994; Kemp & Madden, 1998; Allen & \n 6\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nShen, 1999; Mazzarol & Soutar, 1999; Mok, 1999; Ford et al., 1999; Armstrong, \n2001; Ivy, 2001; Coates & Adnett, 2003; Farr, 2003), funding issues (Brookes, 2003), \nand widening participation or social segmentation (Ball et al., 2002; Reay et al., 2002; \nBrookes, 2003; Farr, 2003).     \nResearch into higher education choice, or consumer behaviour in higher education \nmarkets, although not extensive, has principally been stimulated by an individual \ninstitution\u2019s need to anticipate the long term implications of choice and to understand \nthe key factors involved in student choice (Foskett & Hemsley-Brown, 2001) \nprincipally in the UK and Australia. The attempts by governments to enhance the \nquality of higher education through the encouragement of market forces is based on \nan assumption that students are, or will become, informed consumers making rational \nchoices of higher education courses and institutions (Baldwin & James, 2000).  \nHowever, despite the substantial literature on the marketisation of higher education \nand consumer behaviour, scholarship to provide evidence of the marketing strategies \nthat have been implemented by higher education institutions on the supply-side \nremains limited, and this is relatively uncharted territory.  Therefore, in the context of \nincreasing competition universities were forced to equip themselves with the \nnecessary marketing intelligence and information that would enable them to face the \nchallenge of such an international market for higher education (Binsardi & Ekwulugo, \n2003).   \nBased on this systematic review, our argument is that the literature on HE marketing \nis incoherent, even inchoate and lacks theoretical models that reflect upon the \nparticular context of HE and the nature of their service (e.g. long-term outcomes for \nclients; a very classified market; service values which relate to the numbers of \n 7\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \napplicants rejected etc.). Further, we argue that the research on HE marketing draws \nits conceptualisations and empirical frameworks from services marketing, despite the \ndifferences in context between HE institutions and other service organisations. Thus, \nsome of the models used in this literature seem to be incompatible with the nature of \nHE and universities\u2019 organisational structures.   \nThe following sections explore the emergence of HE marketing, the international \ncontext of research in HE marketing, and demand side issues.   \nThe emergence of marketing in HE  \nMost educational institutions now recognise that they need to market themselves in a \nclimate of competition that for universities is frequently a global one, and substantial \nliterature on the transfer of the practices and concepts of marketing from other sectors \nto higher education has been developed (Gibbs, 2002).   For example, Nguyen & Le \nBlanc (2001) focused on the image and reputation of the institution and referred to the \ncrucial role these factors played in the development of market positioning \u2013 they drew \non the well established concepts and theories in business sector marketing for their \nstudy. Bonsardi & Ekwulugo (2003), who claimed that \u201ca centrally important \nprinciple of marketing is that all marketing activities should be geared towards the \ncustomer\u201d, also relied on the literature used in business sector marketing, and applied \nit to the context of higher education.  \nLiterature on education marketing which originated in the UK and US in the 1980s \nwas theoretical-normative in nature and was based on models developed for use by \nthe business sector (Oplatka & Hemsley-Brown, 2004).  Books of this type have \ncontinued to be available throughout the 1990s, and to date.  The literature included \n 8\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nbooks and manuals on how to market institutions (E.g. Kotler & Fox, 1985; Gibbs & \nKnapp, 2001) and how to apply well-established above-the-line (advertising) and \nbelow-the-line practices (e.g. public relations) used in the business sector, to higher \neducation (E.g. Davies & Scribbins, 1985; Keen & Warner, 1989).   \nResearch that began to emerge in the 1990\u2019s interpreted marketing within the \nnarrower definition of marketing communications, and was based on the assumption \nthat in order for any HE institution to market itself successfully managers would need \nto examine the decision-making process and potential students\u2019 search for \ninformation.  Therefore researchers conducted studies of the content of the print \ncommunications available for applicants (Mortimer, 1997; Gatfield et al., 1999; E.g. \nHesketh & Knight, 1999).  There was also much debate about who the customers of \nhigher education were: \u201cstudents can be either considered as customers (with courses \nas the higher education products) or as products with the employers being the \ncustomers\u201d (Conway et al., 1994 p.31).   There was also some resistance to the notion \nof students as consumers. For example Barrett (1996 p.70) lamented that \u201cIt is both \nregrettable and ominous that the marketing focus, explicitly borrowed from business, \nshould be accepted and even welcomed.\u201d   Such comments serve to highlight \nincreasing concern regarding the marketisation of HE through the use of business \nterminology, which served to emphasise that HE was rapidly being regarded a \nbusiness, like any other.  In some cases, opponents of the introduction of market \nforces in education believe that the business world morally contradicts the values of \neducation; therefore, they would argue that educationalists ought to oppose any form \nof marketing in their institution.  \nLater, it was recognised that higher education was not a product, but a service, and the \n 9\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nmarketing of services was sufficiently different from the marketing of products, to \njustify different approaches (Nicholls et al., 1995).  For example, Mazzarol (1998) \nfocused on the nature of services, and services marketing and he highlighted the key \ncharacteristics that provided a basis for services marketing: the nature of the service \ni.e. that education is \u2018people based\u2019, and emphasised the importance of relationships \nwith customers.   \nBusiness sector marketing theory, and associated definitions of the concepts of \nmarketing developed by well-established authors in the field \u2013 particularly Kotler \n(E.g. Kotler & Fox, 1985; Kotler & Armstrong, 2003; Kotler, 2003) \u2013 have continued \nto be used to underpin research by authors of papers on education marketing (Ivy, \n2001; Nguyen & LeBlanc, 2001; Klassen, 2002; Maringe & Foskett, 2002; Binsardi \n& Ekwulugo, 2003).  Kotler & Fox (1985 p.6) provided a definition of education \nmarketing as early as 1985, stating that marketing in the context of education was: \n\u201cthe analysis, planning, implementation and control of carefully formulated programs \ndesigned to bring about voluntary exchanges of values with a target market to achieve \norganisational objectives\u201d.  Some of the earlier definitions concentrated on \u201cproduct \nmarketing\u201d for example Kotler & Fox\u2019s (1985) definition stated that students were the \n\u201cproduct\u201d and employers were the customers, whilst Levitt (1980) also viewed a \nuniversity\u2019s offerings as products (cited by Binsardi & Ekwulugo, 2003).  Later in the \n1990s higher education marketing was defined within the services marketing \ndefinition, for example Mazzarol (1998) highlighted the key characteristics that \nprovide of services marketing based on the nature of the services using theory \ndeveloped by well-established researchers in business management (e.g. Zeithaml et \nal., 1985; Parasuraman et al., 2004).  The recognition that HE was one of the service \n 10\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nindustries further shows that some authors in the field were anxious to ensure that HE \nwas recognised as a business: a service sector business.  \nInternational context \nStudies of international marketing focusing on students who sought higher education \noutside their home country, has been a key topic for empirical research (Mazzarol, \n1998; Binsardi & Ekwulugo, 2003; Gray et al., 2003) and theoretical papers (Nicholls \net al., 1995; Mazzarol & Hosie, 1996; Mazzarol & Soutar, 1999; Czarniawska & \nGenell, 2002).  Much of the interest in research in marketing of HE has been \nstimulated by increasing competition for overseas students, for example, Gomes & \nMurphy\u2019s (2003) study of potential HE students\u2019 use of the Internet to facilitate \ninformation searching and decision making.  Theoretical papers identified for this \nreview, focused on advertising and access to information in UK markets (Nicholls et \nal., 1995; George, 2000), gaining competitive advantage (Mazzarol & Soutar, 1999; \nCzarniawska & Genell, 2002) institutional and sector image (George, 2000; Oplatka, \n2002) and market differentiation through segmentation and market positioning \n(Mazzarol & Hosie, 1996; Czarniawska & Genell, 2002).   \nDemand-side issues \nOn the demand-side, a number of papers have focused on the choice factors of the \nstudent-consumer (Baldwin & James, 2000; Umashankar, 2001; Pugsley & Coffey, \n2002; Binsardi & Ekwulugo, 2003) and research seeking to identify key factors in the \nchoice of higher education has been conducted by researchers based in Australia (e.g. \nKemp & Madden, 1998; Soutar & Turner, 2002) and the UK (e.g. Ball et al., 2002), \nwith some research on students choice in international markets  (e.g. Gomes & \n 11\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nMurphy, 2003).  The subject of the demand-side of higher education markets \nincluding choice factors, however, justifies a separate study, and this body of research \nis mentioned here because these studies overlap the period of this review, and \nundoubtedly had an impact on studies of supply-side marketing.   \nMethodology \nSystematic review has its origins in the medical field and has been developed through \nthe Cochrane Collaboration (Sheldon & Chalmers, 1994; Booth, 2001).  Some of the \nfeatures of this approach have been adopted in the social sciences, for example in \neducation (e.g. Evidence for Policy and Practice Information Co-ordinating Centre \n(EPPI-Centre)) (Hemsley-Brown & Sharp, 2003).   More recently the approach has \nbeen closely scrutinised to determine its appropriateness in the management field and \nconclusions indicate that \u201cfor practitioners\/managers, systematic review helps develop \na reliable knowledge base by accumulating knowledge from a range of studies\u201d \n(Tranfield et al., 2003 p.220).   \nThe approach for this study entailed extensive searches of relevant business \nmanagement and education databases, namely: BEI; Emerald Full-Text; ERIC; \nEBSCO (Business Source Premier & PSYCINFO); Ingenta (including Science \nDirect).  Hand searches, and internet searches were also conducted to identify \nsecondary references, and further publications by authors identified in the original \nsearches.  For example: British Journal of Management; International Journal of \nEducation Management; and Journal of Services Marketing. \nSearches of electronic and on-line databases using thesaurus search terms were \ncarried out and tracked during the search process.  The searches required the authors \n 12\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nto identify thesaurus terms and combine them with \u201chigher education\u201d or \n\u201cuniversity[ies]\" for search purposes for example: branding; markets [not labour \nmarkets]; marketing; marketisation; positioning; segmentation; and targeting were \nused for systematic searching.  The intention was to ensure that, as far as possible, all \nliterature in the field was identified, while keeping the focus on literature of greatest \npertinence to the research questions to identify the \u2018best evidence\u2019 for the review.   \nThe search was limited to publications between 1992 and 2004.  The starting date was \nchosen because \u201cin the UK in 1992 the 42 former polytechnics joined the traditional \nuniversities\u201d (Bakewell & Gibson-Sweet, 1998 p.108) to mark the start of a new \nunified HE sector in the UK.  The review considered publications in the English \nlanguage from the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), Canada, Australia, \nNew Zealand, Asia and Europe.  Published scholarly journal papers reporting on \nempirical research were prioritised; unpublished conference papers and opinion pieces \nin professional publications were excluded.   \nThe searches resulted in 63 papers (empirical and theoretical) being selected for more \ndetailed scrutiny from 937 citations.  All searches were tracked using a database and \nthe selected citations were documented using reference manager software (with links \nto original sources) and a Word (mail-merge) database.  Each publication was \nscrutinised for its pertinence to the remit of the review, and following strict \napplication of the search parameters, 15 empirical research papers on \u201cthe supply side \nof marketing\u201d were selected for inclusion in this review. 13 papers reported on the \nfindings from primary research studies (Mortimer, 1997; Bakewell & Gibson-Sweet, \n1998; Mazzarol, 1998; Gatfield et al., 1999; Hesketh & Knight, 1999; Ivy, 2001; \nNguyen & LeBlanc, 2001; Klassen, 2002; Maringe & Foskett, 2002; Arnett et al., \n 13\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I.

Each \nempirical research paper was subjected to a thorough review, using a standard \nframework to extract key information about the purpose; the definition of marketing \nused for the study; design, sampling, methodology, findings and implications of the \nstudy.  \n In addition, the authors identified three journal papers (Nicholls et al., 1995; \nMazzarol & Hosie, 1996; Mazzarol & Soutar, 1999) which discussed key theoretical \nissues pertinent to the research objectives.   Issues and conclusions drawn from \ntheoretical papers are referred to separately, and used as supporting evidence for the \nfindings from empirical research or to make comparisons. \nFor the purposes of analysis and reporting,  the authors have used \u2018thematic analysis\u2019, \nderived through an aggregative and interpretative approach, which aimed to \nsummarise what is known and established already, and focused on the extent to which \nconsensus is shared across various themes (Tranfield et al., 2003).  A table \nsummarising the key features of the 15 papers used for the review, is provided in \nAppendix a.   For the purposes of this paper, the knowledge base on higher education \nmarketing has been categorised into broadly three types of studies, based on the \nthemes that emerged during the analysis.  The types of studies identified by the \nsystematic review process, for example, whether they were qualitative or quantitative, \nthe method of data collection and the sampling, are presented and discussed.  The \nsections broadly follow an historical timescale where the earliest studies tended to be \non marketing communications and consumer behaviour; and more recent studies \nexamined the models of marketing, and discussed issues related to strategic \n 14\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I.

Findings from the systematic review, therefore, will be presented and \ndiscussed under the following section headings.    \n1. Empirical studies identified for the review (methodologies and sampling) \n2. Marketing communications: (communicating image and reputation and \nconsumer behaviour issues). \n3. Marketing models (transactional vs relationship; marketing product vs services \nmarketing \n4. Strategic marketing: segmentation, targeting, positioning & branding \nEmpirical studies identified for the review \nThe sampling and methodologies used for the 15 empirical research studies identified \nfor more detailed scrutiny in this review covered a range of techniques, sampling \nmethods and populations (see Appendix A).  Eight studies were based on samples of \nhome-based UK (Bakewell & Gibson-Sweet, 1998; Hesketh & Knight, 1999; Farr, \n2003), Canadian (Nguyen & LeBlanc, 2001), Australian (Rindfleish, 2003) or \ninternational (Arnett et al., 2003; Binsardi & Ekwulugo, 2003; Gray et al., 2003) \nstudent-consumers of university education (potential students, current students and \nalumni).  Four studies sampled information sources: one used websites (Klassen, \n2002) and three used print documents such as prospectuses (Mortimer, 1997; Gatfield \net al., 1999; Hesketh & Knight, 1999).  Four international studies used a sample of \nmanagers from universities: vice chancellors (Maringe, 2004), marketing managers or \nrecruitment managers (Mazzarol, 1998; Ivy, 2001; Maringe & Foskett, 2002).  Studies \nalso used multiple methods e.g. Hesketh & Knight (1999) used prospectuses and \n 15\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \ncollected data using focus groups with students, and Binsardi & Ekwulugo (2003) \ncollected and analysed primary and secondary data.   \nThe research identified for the study was broadly divided into two design categories \n(Malhotra & Birks, 2000 p.9): \u201cproblem identification\u201d or research that tended to \nidentify a problem associated with the marketisation of HE, and throw down a \nchallenge to academics, policy-makers and marketers for its solution; and \u201cproblem \nsolving\u201d research, which sought to apply well-established marketing practice, \nincluding strategic marketing, to the HE sector. The findings from this review will be \nsummarised and critically reviewed in the following sections.   \nFindings: The themes and areas of the research on HE marketing \nSeveral areas of research arise from the current review, and support the argument of \nthis article in that they represent issues and research agendas that appear to be more \non par with the features and processes of industrial\/commercial\/business and services \nmarketing rather than with the particular features and processes of HE institutions and \nservices.  \nMarketing communications  \nOne of the key themes of the empirical research identified for this study into higher \neducation marketing was issues related to marketing communications and the \ndissemination of marketing information in the context of choices made by potential \nstudents of higher education.  Three studies focused on the print communications \nprovided for potential students in the form of prospectuses, booklets and student \nguides: two studies were conducted in the UK (Mortimer, 1997; Hesketh & Knight, \n 16\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \n1999) and one in Australia (Gatfield et al., 1999).  All three studies were based on a \nproblem identification approach and based their studies on the possible match, or mis-\nmatch between choice factors of student-consumers and the information provided in \nthese documents.  In all three cases the authors argued that there was a gap: that \ndocuments provided for prospective students frequently failed to give sufficient \ninformation about academic and practical aspects of the programme (Hesketh & \nKnight, 1999); and that items were frequently missed by universities in publications, \nfor example, good teaching, class timetables (Gatfield et al., 1999). All three authors \nused analysis of secondary data (e.g. Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA)) as \na basis for their arguments (as opposed to marketing theory) and made assumptions \nthat the choice factors stated by potential students in primary research studies should \nbe met though provision of information in print documents.  Conclusions from these \npapers, therefore, suggested that there was a substantial information gap between \nchoice factors identified by students in the surveys and the information that had been \nprovided by universities in their print communications.  These findings led one author \nto conclude there was a \u201clack of market orientation and customer focus and that \nuniversities could achieve competitive advantage if they became more aware of \nstudents\u2019 needs and provided that information in these documents\u201d (Mortimer, \n1997p.225).  On the basis of these findings Mortimer (1997) criticised universities for \nthe absence of information which, she claimed put students, particularly overseas \nstudents, at a high risk of making a poor choice.   These studies were, however, \nconducted prior the rapid development of on-line access to information about \nuniversities.  \nMore recently in 2002 Klassen assessed a randomly selected sample of 120 web sites \n 17\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nof top- and lower-ranked US universities and colleges using Kotler\u2019s (1996) \u201cfive-\nlevel-model of relationship marketing\u201d (cited by Klassen, 2002 p.82).  Unlike the \nstudies discussed above, this study was not focused on the information provided for \nstudents based on choice factors, but nonetheless employed a problem identification \napproach.  The agenda had moved on by 2002 and the author identified a new area \nthat he believed was lacking in this form of communication \u2013 failure by low-ranking \nuniversities to provide sufficient interactive and relationship building capabilities on \ntheir web-sites.   \nA more holistic problem identification approach to the study of marketing \ncommunications was taken by Gray et al., (2003) in Australia with a convenience \nsample of 1,096 students attending private colleges, high schools, universities and \npolytechnics in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.   This study, which focused \nprimarily on branding, investigated the media that students used to gain information \nabout foreign universities, and using One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and t-\ntests, concluded that \u201cthe World Wide Web (WWW) and print media were perceived \nto be the most important sources of university information in all three Asian markets\u201d \n(Gray et al., 2003 p.113).  The researchers acknowledged, however, that: \u201cstudents \nhad different media preferences which might be related to differences in cultural \nvalues, levels of Westernisation and communications infrastructure in their home \ncountries\u201d (Gray et al., 2003 p.111). \nThe study of marketing communications and information dissemination, however, \nseems to focus on issues that are hard-to-get in HE; Can, for example, universities \npublish the rank of their lecturers' effectiveness? Could we expect applicants to gain \nsufficient information on educational programmes that are virtually non-tangible, hard \n 18\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nto define in terms of efficiency and teaching and learning expertise? No doubt, it is \nhardly surprising that some researchers concluded that HE institutions are less likely \nto adopt market orientation. It is argued here that the examination of their marketing \nefforts on the basis of this orientation overlooks the fundamental nature of HE.  \nImage and Reputation \nIn addition to research which studied the information provided in marketing \ncommunications, a number of studies focused on the image and reputation of \ninstitutions (Nguyen & LeBlanc, 2001) or sectors e.g. polytechnics and old \nuniversities in the UK (Bakewell & Gibson-Sweet, 1998; Ivy, 2001); old universities \nand technikons in South Africa (Ivy, 2001), and the image of HE in the UK as \nperceived by international students (Binsardi & Ekwulugo, 2003).  In common with \nother problem identification research designs Bakewell & Gibson-Sweet (1998) raised \nconcern about lack of information for student decision-makers and explored the \nperceptions students held of the former polytechnics \u2013 \u201cnew\u201d universities in the UK.  \nThe authors concluded that students in the sample were ill-informed about the \nresearch differences between institutions and suggested that \u201cnew universities might \nseek to re-position themselves in order to attract successive generations of students\u201d \n(Bakewell & Gibson-Sweet, 1998 p.108).    Research on the marketing positioning of \nuniversities was subsequently conducted by Ivy (2001).  The study aimed to \ninvestigate how universities use their marketing to differentiate their images in the \nhigher education market, and he provided a perceptual map plotting the market \npositioning of UK (old and new) and South African universities (old and technikon). \nBased on theory developed by Kotler & Fox (1985) he confirmed that it was \nimportant for universities to conduct a market analysis to establish their market \n 19\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nposition and to present the institutional image effectively (Ivy, 2001).   \nA study conducted in Israel (Oplatka, 2002), using a problem identification approach \nexplored the messages low-stratified higher education institutions used to increase \ntheir organisational image and \u201cproduct\u201d status and attract prospective students.  The \nauthor argued that low status HE institutions should refrain from adopting an image of \nhigh stratified HE institutions, because it contributed to a contradiction between the \nimage they tried to convey and their reputation in the market. Oplatka (2002) \nacknowledged, however, that marketers of low-status institutions may face a \nprofessional dilemma from the need to elevate the institutional image and attract as \nmany students as possible. \nAlong the same lines, Canadian researchers (Nguyen & LeBlanc, 2001) argued that \u201ca \nreview of the research in the field of management education revealed little empirical \nevidence to support the relationship between institutional image and institutional \nreputation (Nguyen & LeBlanc, 2001).  Based on theories developed by economists, \norganisational theorists and marketers, the researchers conducted a study of a \nconvenience sample of 395 business students which aimed to identify the main effects \nof institutional image and institutional reputation on student retention or customer \nloyalty.  Nguyen and Le Blanc (2001) claimed there was a consensus on the essence \nof the concept of reputation in that it was the result of the past actions of an \norganisation, and they found that the interaction between institutional image and \ninstitutional reputation contributed to improved customer loyalty.  Further, they added \nthat elements such as faculty members and facilities on campus were critical factors \nwhich helped determine students\u2019 perceptions of the image or reputation of a higher \neducation institution.   This approach was also predominantly a problem identification \n 20\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \ndesign as were most of the studies which focused on marketing communications, \nimage and reputation (with the exception of work by Ivy (2001)).   \nIt seems important to note that the concept of institutional image and reputation might \nbe interpreted differently in HE compared with other services organisations. A \ncompany's high reputation, for instance, is usually connected to high sales and high \ndemand from customers.  In contrast, a HE institution\u2019s high reputation is often linked \nto minimal \u201csales\u201d, i.e. the more prestigious the HE institution is, the fewer students it \noften accepts onto its educational programmes. In this sense, a HE institution that tries \nto increase its image through new facilities is considered to be less attractive than \nthose to which many apply regardless of these \u201ctangible\u201d aspects of the institution.  \nFor example, an \u201cold\u201d university may continue to receive three or four times as many \napplications as there are places on programmes; thus many potential clients are \nrejected \u2013 but this only serves to improve the reputation and image of that university.  \nIn most service industries, however, if customers were repeatedly unable to purchase \nthe service, this would tend to reduce the reputation of that company unless prices \nwere increased to control demand.  \nApplication of marketing models \nComparisons were also frequently made between approaches to the marketing of \nproducts, and the marketing of services e.g. (Kotler, 2003).  The notion of education \nas a service as opposed to a product was presented in some papers, and researchers \nrecommended that programmes of higher education should be marketed on the basis \nof the tenets of service marketing (Umashankar, 2001).  Papers were also identified \nthat had examined perceptions of service quality (Athiyaman, 1997; Mazzarol, 1998; \n 21\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nFord et al., 1999), for example, Mazzarol (1998) examined the nature of services and \nconcluded that the reason why the service sector had previously been ignored by \nmarketers was because of the intangibility of services.  He quoted from Zeithaml et al \n(1985) who identified four primary characteristics of services: intangibility; \ninseparability; heterogeneity; and perishability \u2013 characteristics that are well \nestablished, and are also quoted by others (e.g. Kotler & Armstrong, 2003).   \nThe two models of the marketing approach which are now very well-established in \nthe field of marketing have frequently been examined by authors, who made \ncomparisons and examined the appropriateness and the value of each approach i.e.: \ntransactional marketing and relationship marketing, e.g. (Gilbert, 2003).      \nTransactional marketing \u2013 the 4Ps \nAlthough an earlier paper had used the 4Ps transactional marketing model (Price; \nPlace; Promotion; Product) to examine students\u2019 relationship with the university \n(Noble, 1989), only one paper identified for this study (since 1992), had attempted to \napply this marketing model to HE.  The central importance of pricing, product and \npromotional variables in designing and marketing UK education overseas was the \nfocus of a study of the international students\u2019 perceptions about UK education and \nUK performance in the world market for international education (Binsardi & \nEkwulugo, 2003).  This study used secondary data provided by HESA, and well \nestablished marketing theory as a starting point for conducting a survey of a random \nsample of 62 international students from developed (54%) and developing countries \n(45%).  The survey was structured using the 4Ps transactional marketing model and \nfound that most foreign students\u2019 needs were clustered around the core and the \n 22\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \ntangible characteristics of the \u201cproduct\u201d (e.g. as academic recognition, quality and \nfollow-up services) and the \u201cprice\u201d (e.g. the fees, scholarships, students\u2019 perceptions \nof value).  Overall the study concluded that the best way to attract more international \nstudents \u2013 according to the respondents \u2013 was to lower tuition fees; provide more \nscholarships and give better quality of care and service.  Secondly, based on \nrespondents\u2019 views, the best promotional strategy was via: alumni, friends, relatives \nUK websites, the British Council, and other promotional media such as TV. Findings \nfrom this problem solving research, which used the 4Ps model, indicated that for \nuniversities to succeed relationships needed to be developed between a range of \nstakeholders and the institution, on the grounds that relationship marketing is \ncharacterised as helping to build \u201ca strong network of relationships and interactions \nbetween the organisation and its customers\u201d (Binsardi & Ekwulugo, 2003 p.319).    \nRelationship marketing \n Gibbs (2001 p.85) pointed out that those involved in higher education \u201cseek to \ndevelop educational relationships rather than transactional deals between traders\u201d, and \nclaimed that the \u201ceconomic market commoditises higher education on the basis of the \naccreditations earned at higher education institutions\u201d.  Three papers identified during \nthe literature searches, relied on a problem solving research design and conducted \nanalysis based on relationship marketing theory (Klassen, 2002; Arnett et al., 2003; \nTrim, 2003) as opposed to the transactional marketing model.  Researchers from the \nUS (Arnett et al., 2003) conducted research to establish whether there were benefits \nfor non-profit organisations such as universities in adopting a relationship marketing \nmodel.  They examined the nature of the exchange relationship in higher education for \nindividual consumers, and based on identity theory they developed a model, specific \n 23\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nto the non-profit context of HE.  Researchers argued that for higher education \nmarketers, encouraging students to be actively involved in school activities and \nimproving or maintaining a level of university prestige encouraged the formation and \ndevelopment of a university identity, which in turn encouraged students to engage in \nsupportive behaviours in the future.  Relationship marketing was considered by the \nauthors to be a viable strategy in the context of HE but they claimed that success \nrequired non-profit organisations, to not only focus on economic rewards, but \nhighlight the \u201csocial benefits including emotional satisfaction, spiritual values and the \nsharing of humanitarian ideals\u201d (Arnett et al., 2003 p.91). \nIn a study of the international marketing of British education, Binsardi & Ekwulugo \n(2003) provided a comprehensive literature analysis which linked relationship \nmarketing to the marketing of services, and emphasised that relationships require at \nleast two parties who are in contact with each other: the customer and the service \nprovider.   There was, therefore, much support for appropriateness of applying the \nrelationship marketing approach to higher education, whereas there was little \nevidence that researchers examined application of the transactional model.  \nIn recent years, it has been recognised that RM strategy seems to be compatible with \nthe nature of the HE services, (and other education sectors) because this approach \npromotes the involvement of students in the marketing and image-building of their \ninstitutions (Oplatka & Hemsley-Brown, 2004). After all, even the best marketers and \nadvertisers could not promote a HE institution if the service staff (e.g., lecturers, \noffice managers, secretaries) were not responsive to the students\u2019 needs and \nexpectations. Future research on HE marketing, it is suggested, will need to extend \nour understanding of the RM strategy and the various tactics to employ it in HE \n 24\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \ninstitutions.   \nStrategic approaches to marketing \nStrategic marketing approaches are mainly those that are essentially tactical and \ndriven primarily by knowledge of consumer behaviour, in order better to compete in \nthe marketplace.   Broadly, there were two approaches to strategic marketing based on \nfirst, a problem identification approach where researchers sought to examine the \ngovernment agenda, for example, widening or extending participation in education, \nand funding changes and consider the implications of the policy in the context of \nmarkets and marketing.  Second, a problem solving design was used by applying \nwell-established business marketing theory and strategies to HE marketing e.g. the \nstrategic tools of marketing.    \nWidening or extending participation in HE  \nTraditional marketing practice is based on the notion that the high participation \ngroups are identified and then targeted, however, the current public policy objective in \nHE in the UK seems to require the opposite approach, i.e. that low participation \ngroups are targeted in order to increase their participation rates (Farr, 2003).  A \nnumber of authors have discussed HE marketing in the context of meeting the \ngovernment\u2019s widening (or extending) participation agenda in the UK (Ball et al., \n2002; Reay et al., 2002; Brookes, 2003; Farr, 2003). For example, one study used a \nproblem identification design to find out how the widening participation agenda had \naffected marketing in higher education institutions and argued that there is a need for \nchanges to marketing approaches in higher education institutions to satisfy the \ngovernment policy changes (Brookes, 2003).  The paper examined the complexity of \n 25\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nthe issues associated with both US and UK higher education and highlighted the \nconflicts (particularly revenue) and the differences in commercial and education \nperspectives.   \nA number of papers (E.g. Conway et al., 1994; Nicholls et al., 1995; Soutar & Turner, \n2002; Farr, 2003) made recommendations about the possible use of marketing \ntechniques in their conclusions as a way of addressing the research problem they \nidentified. For example, research questions such as: \u201chow can under-represented \ngroups in society be targeted when there is increased competition for applications\u201d \n(Farr, 2003) aimed to explore how marketing strategies could contribute effectively to \nmeeting the targets of the widening participation agenda (using a problem \nidentification approach).  Farr\u2019s (2003) paper highlighted the importance of defining \nthe government\u2019s aims carefully in order that marketing can be utilised most \neffectively.  Following analysis of secondary data the author identified a problem \u2013 he \nclaimed that there were biases in higher education participation rates across different \nsocio-economic groups.  However, the author concluded that it was difficult to \nidentify appropriate marketing strategies to meet this agenda, and he offered a \nchallenge to marketers of higher education to develop strategies to address these \ninequalities.   \nStrategic tools of marketing \nA number of research studies focused on specific strategic approaches to marketing \nincluding competition and segmentation (Tonks & Farr, 1995; Soutar & Turner, 2002; \nFarr, 2003; Rindfleish, 2003), targeting  (Farr, 2003), positioning (Nicholls et al., \n1995; Ivy, 2001; Farr, 2003; Gray et al., 2003) and branding (Gray et al., 2003).   \n 26\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nEmpirical studies and theoretical papers also made recommendations that specifically \nreferred to marketing tools and strategies that are well-established in the business \nsector: marketing segmentation, market differentiation; market positioning and market \nplanning.   This research tended to employ a problem solving design, by seeking to \napply the tools of business marketing to the HE sector.   \nMarket segmentation \nDue to the increasing power of technology in the area of customer databases, segment \nprofiling is now commonly used as a way of matching the strategic goals of the \norganisation with the potential needs and wants of segments within specific markets \n(Kotler, 2003).   The university market has been characterised as forming three main \nsegments: international students; mature students and high-school leavers, and each \nsegment considers different factors when making choices (Soutar & Turner, 2002). \nOne study was identified that explored the application of market segmentation to \nhigher education markets.  An Australian study (Rindfleish, 2003) focused on the \nmarketing technique of segment profiling, to examine whether, and in what ways, this \nmarketing tool could be effectively employed to measure the potential of new market \nsegments and the viability of strategic planning goals in the higher education sector.  \nThe study relied on secondary data analysis from a database of 495 students from one \nuniversity using geo-demographic mapping.  The identity of the university used for \nthis study was not disclosed, and the author highlighted the need to keep such \ninformation confidential for commercial reasons.  The author argued that the \ntechnique was useful as a way reducing the risk of specific strategic planning goals, \nby identifying the potential of new market segments and streamlining target \nmarketing practices.  He claimed that the strategic goals of the organisation, whether \n 27\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nthey be goals based on student access and equity needs or an increased target of full-\ncost international students, could be broadly assessed before management decisions \nwere made (Rindfleish, 2003 p.158). \nThe subject of market differentiation was also a key theme of problem solving \nresearch that aimed to explore the possibilities of applying marketing theory to the HE \nsector.   Researchers suggested that more meaningful differentiation of institutional \nmissions and approaches were called for together with more accurate dissemination of \nthese differences to students (Baldwin & James, 2000). Price et al. (2003) \nrecommended a comparison of \u201creputational pull\u201d and \u201cfacilities pull\u201d as a means of \ndifferentiating the brand of different institutions. However, achieving effective \ndifferentiation, required the institution to project an image of perceived added value in \nthe market (Mazzarol & Hosie, 1996).   \nMarket positioning \nAuthors have suggested that universities might need to re-position themselves in order \nto attract successive generations of students (Bakewell & Gibson-Sweet, 1998) which \nmay involve carrying out a situation analysis to ensure that market positioning is \nestablished and strategies are put in place to effectively present the institutional image \nand develop their position in the minds of the public (Ivy, 2001).   . \nGray et al., (2003) recognised that little research had been conducted on market \npositioning in international HE markets even though the overseas market is highly \ncompetitive and there is an increasing emphasis on branding.  Based on a theoretical \nmodel, the four-level classification of international branding strategies, Medina and \nDuffy (1998) identified five main brand positioning dimensions: a university\u2019s \n 28\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nlearning environment (including excellent staff, facilities and resources); reputations \n(including brand name, achievements and high standard of education); graduate career \nprospects (including graduates\u2019 employment prospects, expected income and \nemployers\u2019 views of graduates); destination image (including political stability, safety \nand hospitality) and cultural integration (including religious freedom and cultural \ndiversity)\u201d (Gray et al., 2003 p.115).  They also recommended that future research \ncould investigate the media and brand preferences of parents since they were found to \nbe an important secondary group of decision-makers for choice of undergraduate \nprogrammes.   This research used a problem solving design and lends some support to \nthe importance of image and resources identified in the earlier studies, which had used \na problem identification design, to explore of the effectiveness of marketing \ncommunications and dissemination of information. Here again, nevertheless, \nresearchers have borrowed models that have been developed in non-education sectors \nin order to explain the marketing needs\/processes of HE institutions. \nMarket planning \nRecommendations by authors also frequently related to market planning on the basis \nthat universities varied in their level of awareness of the various types of customers \nand recommended that universities should incorporate a greater market orientation \ninto their strategic planning (Conway et al., 1994).  Papers identified for this review \nalso recommended that marketing should be an integral component of the \ndevelopment planning (Maringe & Foskett, 2002) or strategic planning (Rindfleish, \n2003). \nStrategic approaches were studied by examining perceptions of HE marketing \n 29\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \n(Maringe, 2004) and types of marketing strategies (Maringe & Foskett, 2002).  \nProblem identification research by Maringe & Foskett (2002) asked questions about \nthe marketing challenges university marketers were facing in their institutions in the \nSouthern African region, and aimed to identify how marketing was organised and \nwhat philosophies underpinned marketing perceptions and practice.  They identified \nfour broad marketing strategies that university institutions tended to use: public \nrelations approach; sales approach; customer satisfaction approach; and marketing as \nstrategy approach.  In terms of which strategies and approaches to marketing were \nprevalent in the region\u2019s universities they found that institutions were at different \nstages of development in marketing terms and that marketing functions needed to be \nmore adequately identified and defined.   They recommended that marketing efforts \nneeded to be directed at developing longer term institutional visions and missions that \nincorporated marketing as an integral component of the development plans.  \n      \nDiscussion \nThis review has focused on exploring, categorising and comparing empirical research \nstudies on higher education marketing in an international context. This discussion \ndraws together the key findings, identifies and presents an analysis of the gaps in \nresearch in light of the major argument of this article.   \nFirst, the research identified for the study was broadly divided into two design \ncategories: \u201cproblem identification\u201d and \u201cproblem solving\u201d classification of \nmarketing research (Malhotra & Birks, 2000) \u2013 although some research papers which \nfocused on problem identification suggested strategic approaches as a way of \n 30\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \naddressing the issues raised.  \nProblem identification included: image research, sales forecasting, trends, and market \npotential (Malhotra & Birks, 2000).   Studies identified for this review, included those \nwhich used secondary data analysis, and\/or government policy to provide a starting \npoint for the argument or exploratory research; and approached the issues with a \nnegative stance (e.g. \u201cthere is a lack of\u2026\u201d) with recommendations that focussed on \nspeculating, or warning about the future outcomes. For example, one factor the papers \non HE marketing communications (both print and e-communications) had in common \nwas that the authors had focused on the shortcomings in the context of the current \nresearch agenda. Another example is studies which examined the impact of widening \nparticipation policy and its associated implications for the marketing of HE.  These \nstudies tended to recommend that marketing tools were applied to the problem, but \nfocused primarily on identifying, justifying and analysing a marketing problem in HE \nrather than exploring or recommending specific marketing approaches to addressing \nthe issues that are compatible with the characteristics of HE institutions  \nThe first topic covered for this review was marketing communications, where much \nof the research focused on comparing issues identified by students making choices, \nwith the content of print communications and e-communications.  However, there are \ntwo areas where there is still a paucity of research evidence.  First, the marketing \ncommunications mix includes five elements: advertising; public relations; personal \nselling; direct mail and sale promotion (Kotler & Armstrong, 2003) and each of these \nareas provide potential for research. For example, research to explore the potential of \nsponsorship, or research to examine the use of sales promotion such as offering free \nlaptops or reduced fees as incentives. Second, a lack of research on word-of-mouth \n 31\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \ncommunications and the diffusion of innovations (Rogers, 1995) seem to provide \nfurther topics for future research in this field, all areas that seem to characterise the \nstructure of HE institutions.   \nProblem identification research was also applied to a number of concerns following \npolicy decisions by governments e.g. widening participation and funding issues.  \nAuthors themselves tended to throw down a challenge to marketers to find ways of \naddressing these problems through marketing techniques and strategies.  It seems \nclear there is potential here for further problem solving research to examine ways that \nwell-established marketing approaches could be applied. The introduction of new \npolicies such as \u2018top-up\u2019 fees in the UK, for example is also likely to stimulate \nresearch using a problem identification design, which could subsequently lead to \nfurther application of the 4Ps model \u2013 particularly \u201cprice\u201d \u2013 as part of research to \nexplore solutions.   \nProblem solving research included: segmentation research, product research, pricing, \nand distribution research (Malhotra & Birks, 2000) and includes papers which focus \non strategic approaches to marketing   A number of studies identified for the review \nused marketing theory or theoretical models from business marketing and took a \npositive approach to the issues (e.g. \u201cthis marketing theory is applicable\u2026\u201d) based on \nempirical research and discussion about how the marketing theory could be applied to \nthe context of HE.  This design frequently employed survey approaches (often using \nstatistical techniques) with questions drawn from theoretical models used in business \nsector marketing.  Conclusions often provided insights into the appropriateness of \napplying established marketing theory to the HE context, with some recommendations \nfor adaptation or improved \u2018fit\u2019.   For example, research examining specific strategic \n 32\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nmarketing tools, including segmentation or positioning, or models such as relationship \nmarketing, and the distinct characteristics of services marketing, employed this \napproach.   \nAlthough there have been a number of studies that examined image and reputation, \nthe notion of branding has barely made its mark in higher education marketing.  There \nare a number of concepts associated with branding that have still to be explored.  For \nexample, the HE sector through programme development, may be reflecting a well \nestablished practice developed in business e.g. development of product lines, product \nextensions, raising brand awareness, brand recognition and brand recall (Fill, 2003) to \nname but a few, which could provide topics for further research.   \nThere were also differences between the studied identified for the review based on the \nhistorical context.  The findings indicated that broadly, the earliest studies tended to \nfocus on problem identification, particularly information dissemination in the context \nof student choice, whilst more recent studies tended to begin to consider strategic \napproaches to marketing using a problem solving approach by applying theories that \nare well-established in the business sector.  This pattern has also been observed in \ncountries of the developed world, where university marketing has been described as \nprogressing from its primitive role of serving a tactical function in times of need to a \nstrategic role in shaping the destiny of the institutions.  For example, VCs in \nuniversities in the developing world had a narrow view of the marketing concept and \noften related it to advertising, publicity and information dissemination (Maringe, \n2004).      \nThere was much interest by researchers in the relationship marketing model, and the \n 33\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I. (2006). \u2018Universities in a competitive global marketplace: a systematic \nreview of the literature on higher education marketing\u2019  International Journal of Public Sector Management,   Vol \n19, No 4, pp 316-338 \nrapid development in services marketing in recent years also seems to have gained \nsome ground.  However, there is still much research to be done to explore these \nmodels in the context of HE.  For example work by others (Zeithaml et al., 1985; \nParasuraman et al., 2004) offers much potential for application to the HE sector.   \nFinally, more recent developments in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) \nwhich have emerged in markets where a relationship marketing model has been \nfollowed, also seems to provide potential for research in the HE context.   \nThere are still many issues that remain un-explored, for example: how to market an \ninstitution which relies on the profile of existing students for its image in the market-\nplace; and how to widen participation to attract government funding, when this is \ncontrary to the mission and strategic direction of the institution.  \nThere was also some evidence of negative feelings towards the need for marketing \nactivities, and in some cases there was concern about the application of business or \nindustry sector models to the HE sector.  Clearly much research is needed to examine \nthe notions of: ethical perceptions, personal and moral philosophies, ethical values \nand social responsibilities of those involved managing the marketing of universities, \nparticularly the internal marketing issues.   University managers and academics need \nto consider the marketing not as an alien concept imported from the business world, \nbut as both a viable philosophy and strategy for developing an HE sector which meets \nthe needs of home-based and international customers (Maringe, 2004).  The research \nfield of higher education marketing is still at a relatively pioneer stage with much \nresearch still to be carried out both from a problem identification and strategic \nperspective.  For those with a passion for research, and a belief in the power of \nmarkets and marketing, there is still much to be done in the context of HE markets.       \n 34\nHemsley-Brown J.V. and Oplatka, I.
