Introduction \nToday international business (IB) is ubiquitous. In the advanced world the lives of \nindividuals are enmeshed in a web of products and services produced by a wide \nvariety of IB interests: from the alarm clock that wakes many of us up in the morning, \nthe food and medication we consume and the mobile telephone that accompanies us \nthrough our day to the work and leisure that occupies our lives, the utilities that give \ncomfort and convenience to our home and the bed we lay down to rest in at night. \nEven locally produced goods and services depend on IB whether it be for tangible \ninputs like raw materials or intangibles such as financial and business services. \n 1\nInternational business touch every aspect of our lives whether we are resident in the \nadvanced world surrounded by the cornucopia of desirable products and services or in \ndeveloping countries besieged by the debris of IB activity, like the ship-breakers of \nChittagong in Bangladesh [1] or the Ogoni people enduring the environmental \ndevastation wrought by Oil production in Nigeria [2]. International business is evident \nis all sectors of the economy from agriculture and minerals extraction and processing \nto the manufacture of consumer and producer goods and services. It is present in \nprivate and public sector activities as well as in voluntary and not-for-profit \norganisations. Indeed, IB also pervades black markets and criminal activity, from the \nproduction and distribution of illegal drugs to people trafficking and beyond [3,4].  \nInternational Business is intimately related to the economic, social and \nenvironmental welfare of people around the world. The current economic crisis \ndemonstrates the negative impact of IB with the activities of financial sector \nmultinationals bringing the financial system close to total collapse in the autumn of \n2008. Yet IB can also be a force for good spreading knowledge and contributing to \neconomic growth and prosperity as it did in the post World War II (WWII) Western \nworld. The early years of the 21st century have offered challenges to IB that will \nimpact on its future development. Given the pervasive influence of IB and its power \nto effect positive and negative change we should all be concerned with how IB \ndevelops in the years ahead. For there can be no doubt that the future forms that IB \ntakes will touch on all our lives in many varied ways. \nThis article provides the context for futures thinking in the field of IB by \nproviding an understanding of its historical development and present forms. In so \ndoing, the article provides a basis from which the contributions to this Special Issue \non the Futures of IB can be understood in a broader context. The article begins by \nconsidering the nature of IB. Its historical development is then elaborated, before its \ncurrent significance and trends are considered. Building on the review of past and \npresent we speculate briefly on the possible futures of IB. A number of the future \nscenarios raised will be taken up in other articles in this Special Issue. \n 2\n 2. The Nature of International Business \nBefore progressing further it is necessary to define international business. We can \nbegin by examining the constituent parts of the term. Firstly, \u2018international\u2019 refers to \nsomething of concern to, or involving, two or more nations or nationalities. Secondly, \n\u2018business\u2019 can be used to refer to an industrial, commercial or professional operation \nor a commercial or industrial establishment, and, more generally, the term business \ncan be used to refer to any activity. Popular IB textbooks define IB as a firm that \nengages in international activity, namely through trade or investment [see for \ninstance, 5, p. 709]. In this sense, IB is defined as a commercial business enterprise. \nHowever, such a definition neglects international activity that is non-commercial in \nnature even though such activity may mirror and, indeed, support mainstream IB \nactivity and have a significant impact on the economic, social, cultural and natural \nenvironment. Activities of this sort are varied and include the work of charities and \nhumanitarian organisations like M\u00e9dicin Sans Fronti\u00e8res as well as international \nprofessional organisations such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants \n(ACCA). \nMoreover, IB is more than a commercial entity, it is also an activity. If we \nexplore IB as an activity we need to explore beyond individual enterprises, whether \ncommercial or not, to examine all cross-border activity. Such a broad definition of IB \nrequires consideration of a wide IB system \u2013 incorporating elements impacting the \nbusiness environment, such as, the regulatory and financial system, and the political \nand socio-cultural context. Such an approach to IB presents difficulties in term \nseparating the study of IB from the broader field of international political economy. \nConsequently, for the purposes of this article we focus on IB defined in terms of the \ndiverse international activities undertaken by a wide range of commercial \norganisations. \nInternational business as a business entity is often seen as synonymous with \nMultinational Enterprise (MNE) [6]. However, MNE \u2013 a term often used \ninterchangeably with Multinational Corporation (MNC) and Transnational \nCorporation (TNC), has been variously defined [7-10] with key characteristics \n 3\nincluding Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)1 and\/or control over production facilities \nin overseas locations. Indeed, IB is most often associated in popular discourse with \nthe activities of giant global corporations, including for example General Electrics, \nBritish Petroleum, Shell, Exxon Mobile, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nestl\u00e9, McDonald\u2019s, \nMicrosoft, News Corporation, NIKE, Vodafone and Wal-Mart, to name but a few. \nYet, it is important to recognise that IB takes many forms from international trading \nactivity and international investment flows to collaborative agreements between \norganisations from different countries including, for instance, franchising, licensing, \nalliances, joint ventures and subcontracting. Consequently, IB incorporates much \nmore than the activities of the traditional MNE. \nFurthermore, IB is also evident in the movement of people whether it is to \nconsume goods and services aboard, as in tourism, or working overseas, such as \nexpatriate managers or low cost migrant workers. Much IB activity is hidden from \nview, conducted as it is by local and seemingly independent organisations. Hence, the \ntraces of IB that visibly populate our everyday activity are only parts of a much more \npervasive mesh of activity. Even some huge corporations have a low profile in the \npopular consciousness. Who, for instance, is familiar with Cargill, a privately owned \ninternational producer and marketer of food, agricultural, financial and industrial \nproducts and services? Founded in 1865, Cargill employs some 159,000 people in 68 \ncountries and enjoyed sales and other revenues of $116.6 billion and net earnings of \n$3.33 billion in the fiscal year 2009 [12]. \nInternational business then includes a wide range of business organisations \nand activities from global corporations to cross-border networks of nationally owned \nbusinesses engaging in trade and various mutually beneficial contractual and \ncollaborative arrangements. Moreover, the IB organisations of today may be the result \nof the lengthy evolution of local firms into regional, national and finally international \nbusinesses or, alternatively, from the emergence of born global businesses that exploit \nniche markets at an international level and employ technology and networks to realise \ntheir global ambitions rapidly [13]. Information and communication technologies \n(ICTs) have certainly influenced the scope and reach of IB activity. For instance, by \nenhancing communications across distance ICTs increase the span of control and \n                                                 \n1 FDI differs from international portfolio investment in that it is investment made to acquire a lasting \ninterest in an overseas enterprise with the aim of acquiring an effective voice in the management of the \nenterprise [11]. \n 4\nfacilitate the development of new organisational forms and the construction of loose \ninternational network structures [14]. \nThe development of IB is, of course, intimately connected to the development \nof national and international economic systems. In the current era IB both contributes \nto and is shaped by the process of globalisation. Globalisation refers to the growing \neconomic interdependence and integration between countries brought about through \nthe increasing cross-border mobility of goods, services, capital and people facilitated \nby technological change, the rise of MNEs and the liberalising policies of nation \nstates and international regulatory institutions [10, 15, 16]. Before giving further \nconsideration to contemporary issues, we turn now to the antecedents of IB. \n \n3. International Business: Past  \nInternational business activity has a long history. Trade has existed since the earliest \ncivilizations long before the idea of the nation existed and therefore before such trade \ncould be conceived of as international. Moore and Lewis [17, 18] trace early forms of \nIB back to the trading activities of the Ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians. The \nantecedents of IB as we know it today can be found in the cross border activity of \nbanking families such as the House of Medici in Europe in the 15th century [19] and \nthe trading companies of the 17th century, such as the East Indian Company, Hudson \nBay company and the Dutch East India Company [20]. Chartered by their national \ngovernments to undertake trading activities in their colonies, the interests of such \ncompanies were very much determined by the imperatives of state. \nAlthough it is commonly believed that the rise of IB took place following the \nWWII, economic historians have clearly demonstrated that FDI and the modern \nmultinational emerged in the second half of the 19th century [6, 21]. Up until this \npoint much IB activity was sporadic and opportunistic and rarely long-lived. Direct \ninvestment during the 19th century was primarily concerned with the extraction of raw \nmaterials from colonial territories, but by mid-century FDI in manufacturing began to \ngrow [21, 22]. Through the late 19th and early 20th centuries the organisation of IB \nbecame more complex as companies first expanded across nations and then borders \naided by new transportation and communication technologies including the steam \ntrain and the telegraph. As companies grew they often extended both their \n 5\ngeographical scope and the range of products produced, requiring the development of \nincreasingly sophisticated organisational structures to ensure effective management \nand coordination of activities [23, 24].  \nWithout a doubt the development of IB was disrupted in the first half of the \n20th century by the two World Wars (1914-1918 and 1939-1945) as well as the great \ndepression in the intervening years. The post-WWII period witnessed a surge of IB \nactivity. Yet this was far from a global phenomenon as the end of the WWII saw the \nworld divided into the two opposing ideological blocs of Western Capitalism and \nEastern Socialism - a separation that lasted for more than 40 years. Nevertheless, \nunder the Western capitalist system IB flourished. \nThe post WWII period of IB expansion and economic integration in the \nWestern hemisphere was promoted by collaborative international efforts to manage \nthe world economy with the aim of avoiding the destructive protectionist policies that \nhad contributed to the severity of the economic depression in the early 1930s and the \nrise of extreme nationalist movements in the years preceding the out break of WWII. \nA number of international institutions were established, which sought to stabilise the \ninternational economic environment and facilitate the growth of international trade \nand investment. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development (IBRD), which later became know as the World \nBank, were established as part of the Bretton Woods agreement to construct an \ninternational monetary system with a view to bringing stability to exchange rates and \nmanaging balance of payments difficulties in an orderly and cooperative manner. In \naddition, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), an organisation that \nwas incorporated into the World Trade Organisation in 1995, sought to develop a \nliberalised international trading regime promoting the benefits of free trade and \npreventing the damaging effects of the adoption of protectionist policies. \nFrom the late 1940s until the late 1960s these institutions together with the \ndemand management policies adopted by major Western governments brought about \na period of stability, economic growth and international integration. During this \nperiod IB in general, and, specifically in the form of the MNE, prospered. Western \nEuropean markets offered significant opportunities for US firms; opportunities that \nwere enhanced by tax incentives and reconstruction funded by the Marshall Plan. \nEuropean MNEs developed rapidly following the post war reconstruction and \n 6\nrecovery and by the late 1960s Japanese MNEs were developing as competitive rivals \nto those in the West. \n Impacting upon economies both in terms of wealth creation, employment, \ntechnology transfer, innovation and regional development, IB began to attract the \nattention of academics and policy makers during the 1950s and 1960s. So much so \nthat it was in this period that the academic discipline of IB came into being firstly in \nthe US before spreading to Europe. For instance, Columbia University introduced the \nfirst a Masters of Science Programme in International Business in 1955 [25]. In 1959 \nthe Association for Educators of International Business was established, which later \nbecame the Academy of International Business [26, p. 146]. In addition, a number of \nIB research journals were established in this period.2  \nMajor contributions to the understanding the economics of IB were also \ninitiated during this period including Stephen Hymer\u2019s [28] seminal contribution on \nthe determinants of FDI and Raymond Vernon\u2019s [29] product-life cycle approach, \npaving the way for later theoretical developments from Knickerbocker [30], Aliber \n[31], Buckley and Casson [32], Rugman [33] and Dunning [34] among others3. The \npower and influence amassed by MNEs also stimulated a critical strand of research \nconcerning the impact of MNEs on, for instance, national sovereignty, development \nand dependency and labour practices [36 - 40]. A stream of work that has continued \nand developed stimulated by the more widespread concern over the impact of \nglobalisation [41 - 45]. \nThe post WWII period of economic growth came to an end in the 1970s with \nthe collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the oil price increases and subsequent \nrecessions in the major Western economies. In addition to falling demand in their \ntraditional markets, Western MNEs faced competition from emerging multinationals \nfrom the Far Eastern Asian Tigers. Despite the efforts of GATT new forms of \nprotectionism emerged in the West.  To overcome trade barriers MNEs from Japan \nand other Far Eastern nations began to invest and establish production facilities in \ntheir major Western markets. Western MNEs were therefore compelled to restructure \n                                                 \n2 Three IB journals originate in this period, namely, Thunderbird International Business Review \n(TIBR), formerly The International Executive (first published in 1959), Management International \nReview (MIR) (1961) and Journal of World Business (JWB), formerly Columbia Journal of World \nBusiness (1966). Today\u2019s top academic IB journal, Journal of International Business Studies, was not \nestablished until 1970, [27, p. 1]. \n3 For a review of theoretical development concerning IB see Ietto-Gilles [35]. \n 7\nto improve efficiency and become more competitive. The result was a shift from \nFordist mass production systems to more flexible and customised post-Fordist \nproduction system [46]. \nThe restructuring of production at a global level since the 1970 has resulted in \na move towards international production and the adoption of a complex international \ndivision of labour and increasingly sophisticated supply chains. These developments \nwere made possible by new ICTs that allowed the efficient management of global \nproduction systems. Further technological developments encouraged the growth of \noffshoring and outsourcing of labour intensive manufacturing and service activities in \nthe 1990s. \nWhile the 1970s presented challenges for IB it also opened up new \nopportunities. The economic difficulties of the period reduced concerns about the \npower of MNEs as governments focused on their positive impact as potential \nproviders of jobs and engines of growth [47]. National and local governments \ncompeted against one another to attract FDI with tax and other incentives. Even those \ndeveloping countries that turned against MNEs in the late 1960s and 1970s in the \npursuit of nationalist economic policies were forced to reengage with foreign capital \nas the economic environment took its toll. Many developing countries established \nExport Processing Zones (EPZ) in which MNEs are able to operate free from all \ngovernment interference [41]. \nMoreover, the economic turmoil of the early 1970s paved the way for the \nchange from demand management to supply side economic policies. The 1980s usher \nin a new era of economic integration as, following the lead of President Reagan in the \nUS and Prime Minister Thatcher in the UK, national governments and international \ninstitutions embraced neo-liberal economic policies [48]. With the collapse of Soviet \nUnion and the opening up of Eastern Europe and China at the beginning of the 1990s, \ntechnological developments combined with neoliberal policies to facilitate the \nintegration of a truly global economy. In this new environment, unfettered by \nprotective national economies and regulation, IB was able to achieve its present day \nubiquity. \nImportantly, as Ietto-Gilles [49, THIS ISSUE] notes, the neoliberal policies of \nprivatisation and deregulation opened up new opportunities for IB in fields previously \n 8\nreserved for public provision as nationalised industries from coal mining and steel \nproduction to telecommunications, airlines, and utilities were privatised. Partly as a \nresult of such policies the 1980s witnesses a significant growth in IB activity in the \nservice sector, which was formerly highly regulated and often reserved for public \nprovision or national providers [50, 51].  \nThese developments have not been without resistance, most often pursued at \nlocal levels. This resistance reached global proportions in 1999 at the Seattle meeting \nof the WTO. Critics adopted the tools of global media and communication, so \nproductively employed by the interests of IB, to turn the spotlight on to MNEs and the \ninternational institutions whose activities, in line with neoliberal policies they \npromoted, had become so closely aligned with those of big business. Popular protest \nmovements seek to highlight a variety of concerns about the operations and impacts \nof IB from poor working conditions, environmental degradation, abuse of human \nrights and excessive profits to unfair trading practices, issues of accountability and \nnational sovereignty. The battle for Seattle marked the coming of age of a popular, \nthough fragmented, movement against the negative consequences of IB and \nglobalisation more generally [52]. \n \n4. International Business: Present \n4.1. Current significance \nDespite the rise of the anti-globalisation movement, IB in its various forms continued \nto increase in the early years of the 21st century. The current significance of IB is \nillustrated by the trade and investment data. Total world exports amounted to \nUS$19,505 billion in 2008 [53, p. 8], almost a third of the value of total world \noutput.4 Moreover, despite the global financial crisis world trade grew by 2 per cent \nin volume terms over the course of 2008, down on the 6 per cent increase in 2007 [53, \np. 1]. Moreover, according the latest World Investment Report [55, p. xxi]: \n\u2018there are some 82,000 TNCs worldwide, with 810,000 foreign affiliates. \nThese companies play a major and growing role in the world economy. \nFor example, exports by foreign affiliates of TNCs are estimated to \n                                                 \n4 According to the IMF [54, p. 189, Table A1] the value of World output amounted to 60,690 billions \nof US dollars at market exchange rates. \n 9\naccount for about a third of total world exports of goods and services, and \nthe number of people employed by them worldwide totalled about 77 \nmillion in 2008 \u2013 more than double the total labour force of Germany.\u2019  \nThe value-added activity (gross product) of foreign affiliates worldwide accounted for \n11% of global GDP in 2007 [56, p. 9]. In addition, FDI inflows reached a historic \nhigh of $1,979 billion in 2007 before the financial crisis began to take its toll resulting \nin a 14% decline to $1,697 billion in 2008 [55, p. xix]. Inflows of FDI continued to \ndecline in the first quarter of 2009, and, although UNCTAD expects a slow recovery \nbeginning in 2010, it also suggests that the crisis has changed the investment \nlandscape with the developing and transition economies\u2019 share of global FDI flows \nincreasing to 43% in 2008 [55, p. xix]. \n While the data on trade and FDI detailed above underline the economic \nsignificance of IB, data on global financial transactions is even more revealing. \nAccording to Galati and Heath [57, p. 63], average daily turnover in traditional \nforeign exchange markets increased significantly from $1,950 trillion in 2004 to $3.2 \ntrillion in April 2007. Although this figure includes the foreign exchange transactions \nrequired to facilitate international trade and investment flows, the vast majority of \nforeign exchange market turnover arises from financial transactions related to trade \nand speculation in financial instruments of various sorts. It is important to note that \nlarge global corporations in all sectors are involved in financial activity. Many have \ndeveloped sophisticated finance divisions specialized in the management of the \ncompany\u2019s liquid assets as well as in the provision of financial services to customers. \nAs Toporowski [58, THIS ISSUE] suggests, for some MNEs this type of activity has \nbecome the main source of profit leading to the development of what he refers to as \nfinancially enhanced transnationals. The severity of the current financial and \neconomic crisis underlines the fact that the financial activities of MNEs can no longer \nbe overlooked when assessing the impact of IB. \nInternational business clearly has a significant direct and indirect impact on \nthe local, national and global economic systems. Moreover, given the concentration of \nfinancial centres and FDI in particular countries and regions the impact of the \nactivities of MNEs can be even more significant than the aggregate data suggest. It is \nthough important to recognize that IB goes beyond the FDI activity of MNEs to \ninclude a wide variety of arrangements that are not captured by investment, \n 10\ninternational trade and foreign exchange flows. Traces of IB are also evident in the \nflows of people, international travel expenditure, licensing and royalties cross-border \npayments, technology transfer agreements, and telecommunications and Internet \ntraffic among others. Nevertheless, the data detailed here does provide an indication \nof the scale and significance of IB in the current era.  \n \n4.2. Current trends \nThe opening up of the public sector activity to IB continues apace as governments \nseek efficiency gains in the provision of services ranging from education, social care, \nhealthcare, prison, policing, and defence services. Despite growing dissatisfaction \nwith contracted out service provision and mounting evidence of failures, governments \ncontinue to promote the private provision of public services [42, 43]. This trend is \nlikely to continue as governments seek to reduce public spending and struggle to pay \noff huge debts incurred in bailing out the banking sector. \nMany factors in recent years have led to IB being placed under increased \npublic scrutiny. The surge in cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the 1990s \nstimulated concerns about the consolidation of market shares and growth of monopoly \npower [59]. Such concerns are renewed in the current economic crisis as companies \nturn, with government approval, to merger and acquisition for their very survival. \nWhile jobs may be saved by such activity consumers may pay heavily in the future \nfrom the lack of competition.  \nThe ICTs that have assisted the growth of IB have also provided its critics \nwith the means of collecting and disseminating information on the unethical and \nenvironmentally damaging activities of some MNEs. Technological developments, in \nparticular the convergence of digital technologies, cheap digital cameras, laptop \ncomputers and Internet connections, have allowed the production and distribution of \nlow cost publications and video. The dominance of global news producers like News \nCorporation is being challenged by news and videos distributed through the Internet.5 \nThose directly impacted by the negative consequences of IB can now reach out to a \n                                                 \n5 For alternative media sources focused on the impact of IB see for example: Multinational Monitor \n(http:\/\/www.multinationalmonitor.org\/ ) and Corporate Watch  (http:\/\/www.corporatewatch.org\/ in \nparticular http:\/\/corporatewatch.visionon.tv\/ ) \n 11\nglobal audience to air their grievances and seek support for their struggle against IB \nwhether in the form of consumer boycotts or shareholder action.  \nInformation and communication technologies allow the development of \ncoordinated activity on the part of consumers and workers on an unprecedented scale. \nAlthough, in relation to cross-border worker solidarity, the current economic down \nturn is likely to test the strength of such developments. Moreover, technological \ndevelopments ensure that people in the advanced countries can no longer ignore the \nimpact of their consumption patterns on workers and citizens of developing \ncountries.6 Inequalities of income and quality of life are there for all to see in the \nwidely distributed news reports, documentaries, films, books and magazine articles. \nYet the voice of the poor may be heard but not heeded. Consumers become complicit \nin the exploitation of workers. Cheap clothing in high street stores and supermarkets \nlike Primark, Tesco and Wal-Mart can only be achieved with low paid labour working \nin poor conditions [61]. Membership of the Ethical Trading Initiative and other efforts \nto display Corporate and Social Responsibility (CSR) do not hide the disparity \nbetween the consumers in the advanced countries and the producers in developing \ncountries. As Banerjee [62] argues, CSR initiatives may be interpreted as ideological \nmovements that aim to legitimize and consolidate the power of large corporations at \nthe expense of external stakeholders. Nevertheless, initiatives to address global \ninequalities have developed and grown, through the work of truly ethical businesses, \ncharities and other NGOs and a wide variety of social movements. One example is the \nFair Trade movement, the roots of which can be traced back to the 1940s in the US \nand 1950s in Europe [63]. In 2008 the estimated retail value of fair trade products was \nalmost \u20ac 2.9 billion [64]. \nAlthough the unethical behaviour and unfettered power of global corporations \nis increasingly brought into question [44], to date little effort to regulate IB has been \nundertaken by national governments or international institutions. At an international \nlevel voluntary codes of conduct and guidelines have been developed by organisations \nlike the OECD, International Labour Organisation and United Nations [65]. A recent \nincarnation of such voluntary codes is the UN\u2019s Global Compact [66]. In the wake of \nthe current financial and economic crisis there are many lessons to be learnt by policy \n                                                 \n6 For instance, we can no longer turn a blind eye to the environmental devastation wrought by Shell in \nthe Ogoniland of the Niger Delta in Nigeria in the search for oil reserves [60]. \n 12\nmakers about IB in the financial sector and beyond. Yet current indications suggest \nreluctances on the part of governments to take on the challenges of regulation. The \nfailures to learn form the corporate debacles of the early 2000s, including Enron in \n2001 and WorldCom in 2002, have been devastating for the global economic system. \nFor the financial activities practiced by Enron, and which eventually resulted in the \ncompany\u2019s collapse, are evident in the financial practices of the failed and faltering \nfinancial institutions in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. Once again there \nis a chance to reconstruct the financial and IB regulatory framework. But will the \nopportunity be grasped? \nThe large global corporations are under pressure in the current economic \nclimate. For example, a number of global car manufacturers and banks have resorted \nto government support to weather the current crisis (e.g. General Motors and \nCitigroup). Others have resorted to mergers or succumbed to takeovers as evident in \nthe banking sector (e.g. Lloyds TSB and HBOS). While mergers and acquisitions lead \nto the consolidation of economic power within some markets, in others MNEs are \nincreasingly subject to competition from smaller more agile organisations, including \nnot for profit organisations as Roberts [67, THIS ISSUE] demonstrates in relation to \nthe development of software. In addition, Western MNEs face increasing competition \nfrom emerging countries, especially Brazil, Russia, India and China (the BRIC \ncountries). Such competition may save IB from rigorous regulation. Different \nperspectives on, for instance, human rights and labour standards in some emerging \ncountries, present challenges for the development of a global consensus on an \neffective regulatory system. \nAlongside these sources of competition, MNEs also face consumer and worker \nresistance to aspects of their competitive strategies. For instance, such resistance has \nbeen evident for some years in the backlash against offshoring [68]. In response, \nMNEs are adapting their competitive strategies and in some cases adopting a more \nlocal image in a bid to lowering their global profile and acquire a new source of \ncompetitiveness. For example, in 2009 Starbuck\u2019s began introducing non-branded \noutlets [69]. \n 13\n 5. International Business: Futures  \nAn exploration of the development of IB reveals its adaptive nature. Looking to the \npossible futures of IB there seems little doubt that, so long as there are profitable \nbusiness opportunities, it will survive and prosper. Several contributors to this Special \nIssue identify the question of the availability of profitable opportunities as a key \nchallenge for IB futures. In \u2018The current economic crisis and international business:  \nCan we say anything meaningful about future scenarios?\u2019, Grazia Ietto-Gillies \nidentifies the root cause of the excessive growth of the financial sector and subsequent \ncrisis in the lack of profitable investment opportunities in the real sector of the \nadvanced capitalist systems. She suggests that short-term remedies include a shift in \nincome distribution to increase the consumption component of the level of effective \ndemand and serious national and international regulation of the financial sector. \nAccording to Ietto-Gilles, in the medium to longer term governments should consider \nengaging in large investment projects such as alternative sources of energy, transport \nas well as in public services, providing profitable private sector investment \nopportunities in the real sector of the economy. The shift in profitable opportunities \nfrom productive (real sector) to the sphere of finance is also examined by Jan \nToporowski in \u2018The Transnational Company after Globalisation\u2019. Toporowski \nexamines how international capital market integration has facilitated the rise of a new \nkind of \u2018financially-enhanced\u2019 transnational, which, unlike the more traditional \nproduction-orientated multinational company, depends for its growth on buying and \nselling companies and exploiting inflating capital markets. But with deflated capital \nmarkets and little prospect of large government investment projects in the near future \nwhere will IB look for profitable opportunities?  \nWill the emerging markets offer new opportunities for MNEs from the West? \nOr will these opportunities be exploited by new MNEs developing rapidly in these \nexpanding economies. Economic recovery is likely to renew the expansionary trend \nof IB from emerging countries. If Western MNEs cannot find sufficient opportunities \nin the emerging markets where will they turn? Perhaps, one path of business \ndevelopment lies in the ever-increasing commodification of everyday life [70]. \nLucrative business opportunities can be inserted into the minutiae of people\u2019s lives \nand relationships \u2013 as exemplified in the market for self-improvement books and \n 14\nmagazines. Other opportunities arise from consumer awareness of the environmental \nand human cost of the products and services they consume. Indeed, new IB activity is \nflourishing to cater for the demands of environmentally concerned consumer, in \nsectors such as tourism, and existing business are adapting their products and services \nby, for instance, offering add-on services such as carbon offsetting. New markets can \nthen be developed by creating new products and services that cater for the demands of \nthe socially and environmentally aware consumer in advanced markets. In line with \nthis is the growing market for the provision of all manner of audits to verify the CSR \nstrategies of business organisations. \nThe challenge of securing profitable opportunities will be particularly intense \nin certain sectors where new technologies have distributed the means of production \nand allowed alternative forms of production to develop. The development of \ncommunity as a new organisational form of multinational activity is raised in Joanne \nRoberts\u2019s article \u2018Community and International Business Futures: Insights from \nSoftware Production\u2019. Employing evidence from the software sector, Roberts explores \nthe scope for international production and innovation to occur in global communities. \nWhile traditional IB may successfully absorb some of this activity there are elements \nthat will remain out of its reach and ensure the survival of competition in at least \nsome areas of productive activity. For instance, in the cultural industries new ICTs are \nincreasingly allowing low cost small-scale production. Moreover, ICTs are also \nleading to a major struggle over the protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs) as \nthey facilitate the illegal appropriation of proprietary knowledge. The enforcement of \nIPRs is currently being rigorously pursued by MNEs in the cultural industries, and \nbeyond [71]. Yet whether these companies can change the culture of free \ndownloading prevalent among today\u2019s youth is open to question. \nThe protection of propriety knowledge is, of course vital, to the \ncompetitiveness of most organisations. To remain profitable MNEs must develop new \nknowledge and products through research and development (R&D) and innovation as \nwell as through the absorption of new knowledge through mergers and acquisitions. \nSuch activity also offers opportunities for the development of new markets. \nInnovation is characterised by two approaches either the exploitation of existing \nknowledge or the exploration for new knowledge. In \u2018Exploitation versus Exploration \nin Multinational Firms: Implications for the Future of International Business\u2019, Michel \n 15\nLeseure and Tarik Driouchi explore the extent to which the innovative process of \nMNEs is characterized by these two alternative strategies. They provide empirical \nevidence of the existence of traditional rigid MNEs seeking benefits from low-risk \nexploitative strategies on one hand, and of flexible MNEs seeking higher performance \nlevels by balancing the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation on the other \nhand. Using a population ecology perspective to study likely ecological scenarios for \nthe future they conclude that traditional multinationals tend to prevail over flexible \nmultinationals. This implies that MNEs remain primarily exploitative, and, other \norganisational forms, such as entrepreneurial small business and communities of \npractices are more likely to be the source of exploratory innovation. Nevertheless, the \ntraditional MNEs will no doubt continue to renew their innovative capacity through \nthe acquisition of smaller entrepreneurial organisations. \nInnovative capacities and knowledge resources are often available to MNEs \nthrough their subsidiaries in host countries. However, the extent to which subsidiaries \nare able to influence and contribute to the organisation\u2019s innovative strategy varies \naccording to the power they wield in the overall structure of the organisation. This can \nbe significant when knowledge is unevenly distributed and when subsidiaries are able \nto employ local knowledge strategically within the organisation. Power gained by \naccess to local knowledge networks may provide a counterbalance to the authority \nand control exercised by the MNEs head-office. Mo Yamin and Rudolf R. Sinkovics \naddress the relationship between headquarters and subsidiaries, together with the \npower dynamics inherent in such relationships, in their article \u2018ICT deployment and \nresource-based power in multinational enterprise futures\u2019. Applying a resource-\ndependency perspective to intra-MNE power, their article examines the effect of the \ndeployment of advanced ICT and particularly the implementation of enterprise \nresource planning (ERP). Yamin and Sinkovics argue that the deployment of ERP \nundermines the resource-base of subsidiary power and thus helps to restore greater \ncentral authority in the MNE. These findings may have significant adverse \nimplications for the futures of the MNE as a federative organisational form and the \nlegitimacy of MNE operations abroad. For how can MNEs benefit from the \nknowledge of subsidiaries if they maintain an organisational structure based on the \ncentralisation of authority? \n 16\nThe location of ownership and control within the organisational structures of \nMNEs has evolved from the hierarchically controlled centrally owned MNEs \nidentified by Chandler [23, 24] in the 20th century to a wide diversity of flatter and \nnetwork type organisations with distributed ownership today [10]. Part of this \nevolution has been the growth of offshoring and outsourcing over the last 15 years. \nYama Temouri, Nigel L.Driffield and Dolores A\u00f1\u00f3n Hig\u00f3n address this topic in their \narticle, \u2018The Future of offshoring FDI in high-tech sectors\u2019. They examine the \nrelatively new practice of outsourcing\/offshoring of high-technology manufacturing \nand services. While the offshoring of labour intensive activity to low cost locations \nhas raise concerns for some time about job losses, the implication of the offshoring of \nhigh-tech activity including R&D activity has wider implications for the sustainability \nof value generating activities and competitiveness of the home country. So while \noffshoring may be a means of developing and exploiting the knowledge capabilities \nof subsidiaries and suppliers there are significant implications for the competitive \nadvantage of the home country with concerns about the \u2018hollowing out\u2019 of national \nhigh-tech capabilities. However, Temouri, Diffield and A\u00f1\u00f3n Hig\u00f3n show that the \npattern of offshoring in high-tech sectors will not necessarily replicate that found in \nlabour intensive sectors. For example, as they note, the risk attached to offshoring in \nhigh-tech sectors including knowledge spillovers to local firms is something that \nconflicts with the desire of both the MNE and the home nation to retain competitive \nadvantage. \nThere are many challenges ahead for those managing IB activity and the final \narticle in this Special Issue is focused on how management education might be \ndeveloped to equip future managers with the abilities required to meet these \nchallenges. In \u2018Problematizing international business futures through a \u201ccritical \nscenario method\u201d\u2019, George Cairns, Martyna \u015aliwa and George Wright proposes the \nneed for change in how IB managers determine organisational objectives and what \ncriteria they use in addressing business problems. They propose a shift from a focus \non profit maximization and shareholder value to a broader societal and environmental \nview. Drawing on contemporary social science interpretation of the Aristotelian \nconcept of phron\u0113sis, or \u2018practical wisdom\u2019, they propose an approach to teaching and \nlearning about IB futures that is based upon the development of what they term a \n 17\n\u2018critical scenario method\u2019. This offers a basis for the investigation of complex IB \nproblems in the \u2018real\u2019 world from a variety of perspectives.  \nNew methods of management education certainly have the potential to shape \nthe range of possible IB futures. Yet, managers are not the only stakeholders in need \nof new educational approaches. Individuals need to understand, and accept \nresponsibility for, their own consumer behaviour. While policymakers, with the \nsupport of informed citizens, need to ensure a more equitable distribution of the \nbenefits of IB. Moreover, we all need to appreciate of the costs of unfettered IB, costs \nthat can touch all our lives and those of generations to come.  \n \n6. Conclusions \nThrough an exploration of the historical development and current significance of IB \nthis article provides the backdrop for the speculations on the futures of IB included in \nthis Special Issue. Key aspects of the workings of global economic systems of \nfinance, manufacture, distribution and consumption that shape our everyday lives are \ntaken up in the contributions that follow. Despite recent economic shocks that show \njust how fragile these global and inter-connected systems can be, a \u2018business as usual\u2019 \nscenario prevails in these articles.  That is to say, a market structure of financially \ndriven and technological based organisations that protect core capabilities from \nspilling out to developing countries, growing ever larger and more powerful to meet \nthe uncritical individual desires of consumers.  The co-evolutionary nexus is between \nfinancial institutions, governance institutions, consumers and MNEs.   \nThe global and local consequences of trends in the evolution of IB are \nprofound. Rather than strengthening the human species, the reduction in diversity and \nassociated resilience is a major threat to humankind. International Business is \nproducing increasingly amplified effects of free market capitalism \u2013 polarised wealth \nand power, narrow channelling of applied human intelligence and an unsustainable \ndegradation in ecological systems.  The raw power of financial systems is exposed by \nthe observation that in a global financial crisis that will take 10 year to repair, the \npeople and institutions that caused the crises continue to be unfeasibly rewarded [72].  \nThose who suffer most from the unconsidered consequences have little power to \nameliorate the causes or effects.   \n 18\nHowever, there are some signals of alternative futures within the articles in \nthis Special Issue.  The signals relate mainly to structures, rather than individual \nagency.  The development of open systems of collaboration, weakening IPRs, the \nreturn to a real economy of value exchange rather than the anticipation of future \nvalue, growing consumer awareness of ethical and environmental issues, the necessity \nof localised social capital for the commodification of everyday life and the \nglobalisation of solidarity amongst knowledge workers are examples of emerging \nstructures.  These structures make possible the development of resilient diverse \nsystems of localised value creation.  Such value creating systems require community \naction and social embeddeness which, compared to globally interlocked systems, \npresents lower systemic risk, lower transactions costs, and less accessibility by big \ninstitutional forces. \nWe must also consider the role of the individual consumer.  A counter-factual \nwould be non-consuming consumers; consumers that in their acts of consuming, \nproduce social, economic and environmental value rather than destroy it.  Such \nresponsible consumption is plausible given greater consumer consciousness of the \ndestructive social, environmental and economic consequences of amplified individual \nconsumption.  A nexus of responsible consumption and open globally informed \nlocalised systems of value creation would produce different paths for IB; not the \nprogressive rise of the ubiquity of \u2018efficient cause\u2019 production, but a flip to global \nawareness of \u2018final cause\u2019 of human achievement.  \nFinally, the question of global governance remains.  The history of IB is a \nstory of reductions in barriers to trade at national levels and a regulatory regime that \nhas favoured economic growth through profit maximisation.  What if the current trend \nof rolling back state and international intervention were reversed in the face of \nincreasing damage to systems deemed by some as non-economic (ecological, social), \nbut actually inherent to an overall healthy global system?  There would be heavy \nresistance to such moves and there may be unintended negative consequences of this \n\u2013 not least the potential for greater corruption.  The articles herein question whether \nadequate global governance of MNEs can be left in the hands of consumer choice, \nworker solidarity and regulation dominated by economic imperatives.  \nThe evidence presented in this Special Issue suggests that MNEs cannot \ndeliver anything more than they deliver now, because they are locked into their own \n 19\neconomic system.  Sustainable futures for International Business will necessitate \nalternative structures and beliefs, some aspects of which have been elaborated in the \npages of this edition of Futures; most of which have yet to be imagined. \n \n \nReferences \n[1] G.
