Changes in the concentration of plasma prolactin in Mute\nswans (Cygnus olor) were compared in non-breeding singletons and breeding pairs. In breeding\nswans, the onset of molt is delayed compared to non-breeders, and is delayed further in breeding\nmales compared to their female partners. The seasonal decrease in prolactin in non-breeding birds\nof both sexes started at the end of May and was associated with the initiation of molt 4 weeks\nlater. The decrease in plasma prolactin  in incubating females was more pronounced, as a\nconsequence of increased prolactin secretion associated with incubation behaviour, but also\nstarted at end of May, and was associated the onset of moult 6 weeks later. In breeding males,\nplasma prolactin increased at the end of May when they started to care for their newly hatched\ncygnets. Correspondingly, prolactin began to decrease 3-5 weeks later in males than in females.\nThese males started to molt in mid August, at least 4 weeks later than females. It is concluded that\nmolt is related to decreasing plasma prolactin, and is inhibited when plasma prolactin is increasing\nor high.\n Keywords: molt, prolactin, incubation, Mute swan\n1 Introduction\nIt is important that birds replace their plumage at regular, normally annual, intervals in\norder to maintain its functional integrity. The period during which feathers are replaced, the molt,\ntends to be separated from times when birds are breeding (e.g. Svensson and Nilsson, 1997) or\nmigrating (Barta et al., 2008) because all three activities are energetically demanding and also,\npresumably, because it would be disadvantageous to be caring for young or migrating when flight\nefficiency is impaired by missing or growing feathers. At the same time, it is advantageous to\nmake maximal use of the time available to replace feathers, so there is often a close relationship\nbetween the end of breeding and the start of molt, and the end of molt and the start of migration.\nAppropriate timing of molt is therefore crucial. Despite the importance of molt and the\nsignificance of its timing, little is known about its physiological control. Several hormone systems\nhave been implicated in molt: thyroid hormones, gonadal steroids and prolactin (Payne, 1972;\nKuenzel, 2003), but a common factor appears to be prolactin. Studies on wild free-living species\n(Lincoln et al., 1980; Dawson and Goldsmith, 1982; Deviche et al., 2000) and wild species held in\ncaptivity under natural conditions (Dawson and Goldsmith, 1984; Williams et al., 1987; Boswell\net al., 1996) have shown that peak prolactin concentrations coincide with the start of molt. Also,\nactive immunization of starlings against vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, the prolactin releasing\nhormone in birds, inhibited the photoperiodically-induced increase in prolactin and prevented\nmolt (Dawson and Sharp, 1998). However, it may not be the case that high concentrations of\nprolactin stimulate molt. Indeed the reverse may be true. Prolactin drives incubation behavior (El\nHalawani et al., 1986; Sharp et al., 1988; review: Sharp, 2008) and probably parental behaviour\nafter hatching. Prolactin concentrations are high in incubating birds and, certainly in altricial\nspecies, remain high during the period of parental care (Goldsmith, 1982b; Goldsmith, 1982a;\nDawson and Goldsmith, 1985; Hiatt et al., 1987; Wingfield and Goldsmith, 1990). Yet breeding\nactivity can delay the start of molt (Morton, 1992; Hemborg and Merila, 1999; Newton and\nRothery, 2005; Meissner, 2007; Allard et al., 2008). High concentrations of prolactin may inhibit\nmolt, so that molt only starts when prolactin begins to decrease (Dawson, 2006). This would still\nresult in a close correlation between peak prolactin and the start of molt and may be a mechanism\nthat minimizes breeding\/molt overlap but at the same time ensures that molt starts as soon as\nbreeding activity has finished.\nThe pattern of molt in Mute swans (Cygnus olor) offers a model to test this. As in many\nspecies (see above), molt is delayed in breeding birds. In addition, in successfully breeding swans,\nmales initiate moult 4-6 weeks after their mate (Heinroth, 1911; Scott, 1972; Czapulak, 2002),\nwhereas in non-breeding flocks males and females moult at about the same time (Coleman et al.,\n2002). In breeding pairs that lose their young, both sexes molt at the same time (McCleery et al.,\n2007). It is possible that males with dependent young delay their molt until the female has well\ngrown feathers so that at least one of the parents has fully feathered wings to protect the young.\n            In this study, we collected serial blood samples from breeding pairs, from incubation until\nmolt had started, and samples from randomly caught non-breeding birds during the same period.\nWe could confidently predict that prolactin concentrations would be higher in breeding birds\ncompared to non-breeding birds, but would prolactin concentrations start to decrease later in\nbreeding birds, and in particular, would prolactin concentrations start to decrease later in breeding\nmales than in their female partners?\n2. Methods\nThe swans used in this study were resident at the Abbotsbury Swannery in the south of\nEngland (50.4 \u00b0N, 2.4\u00b0W). Population dynamics in this flock have been studied for over 25 years\n(McCleery et al., 2008). Uniquely in the UK, these birds breed colonially (Perrins and Ogilvie,\n1981). Each year approximately 150 pairs produce young and another 300 remain as singletons.\nAlmost all birds are banded as cygnets, so their age is known. Most breeding pairs nest near small\npools or ditches and their young are exposed to predation. However, approximately 10 selected\nbreeding pairs are isolated in pens, so their young are almost guaranteed to survive. These pairs\nhave a successful breeding record and are sometimes used to foster lost young. Non-breeding\nbirds spend most of their time on or near a lagoon.\n            At the beginning of May, 2007, six breeding pairs from the pens were caught. The ages of\nmales ranged from 5 to 17 (median 9) and the females 5 to16 (median 10). A blood sample (1-\n2ml) was taken from a wing vein of both the male and the female within 4 min of capture. All of\nthese birds had eggs at this time. Further blood samples were taken from the same birds at\napproximately two week intervals until mid-August. The eggs hatched in late May, and at the end\nof the study, all birds had surviving young. Swans, as many other waterfowl, molt by shedding all\nof their primary feathers at the same time and replacing them simultaneously.  During molt, the\nlength of growing primary feathers was recorded so that the date at which feather growth started\ncould be calculated for each individual by linear regression. On the same dates as breeding pairs\nwere sampled, non-breeding males (age range 2-20, median 5) and females (age range 1-22,\nmedian 5) were caught at random and sampled in the same way. The numbers of birds sampled on\neach date varied from 4-7 for males and 4-9 for females. The length of growing new primary\nfeathers was recorded and the mean date for the start of growth was calculated for each sex by\nlinear regression. Blood samples were allowed to clot at the ambient outdoor temperature for\napproximately 5 h, centrifuged, and serum stored at -20\u00b0 until assay. The work was carried out\nunder Home Office Licence 80\/1944.\n2.1. Prolactin assay\nPlasma prolactin was measured in a single assay with an intra- assay coefficient of variation of\n7.7% as described by Talbot and Sharp (1994). Swan samples diluted parallel to the standard.\n2.2. Statistical analysis\nProlactin data were log transformed before analysis. Differences between male and female non-\nbreeders were assessed by two-way ANOVA and between male and female breeders by two-way\nANOVA with repeated measures. Differences with time within male and female breeding birds\nwere assessed by one way ANOVA with repeated measures, and in non-breeding birds by one\nway ANOVA. Differences between males (breeders and non-breeders) and between females were\nassessed by two-way ANOVA.\n3. Results\nThere were significant differences in prolactin concentrations between the sexes in\nbreeding birds (F1,70 = 16.9 p < 0.001) but not between the sexes in non-breeding birds (F1,68 = 1.2\np = 0.28). Breeding females were significantly different from non-breeding females (F1,69 = 45.2\np < 0.001) and breeding males were different from non-breeding males (F1,69 = 22.6 p < 0.001).\n            The first sampling date was in the latter half of incubation. Female swans incubate the\neggs; males defend the nest but do not incubate (Cramp, 1977). At this time prolactin was much\nhigher in incubating females than in their partners (, and higher than in non-breeding females (p <\n0.01; Fig. 1). The eggs hatched at the end of May. At this time, prolactin concentrations decreased\nin females as they ceased incubation (p < 0.01). In males, prolactin increased at the end of\nincubation (p < 0.05) to values similar to females, as they started to share in the care of the\ncygnets. During the period of caring for cygnets, prolactin was similar in males and females, and\ngradually decreased during this period.  Non-breeding birds had similar prolactin concentrations\nto breeding males at the start of the study. Values in both sexes remained fairly constant during\nMay and then gradually decreased, significantly in males (p < 0.01) but not in females (because of\nthe final values which showed an unexpected non-significant increase).  Non-breeding females\nstarted to molt on June 27 \u00b1 4 (S.E.) days and non-breeding males on 3 July \u00b1 4 days. Breeding\nfemales started molt on 14 July \u00b1 8 days. Two breeding males had shed their primaries on 16\nAugust, but the other four had not started to molt at this time\n4. Discussion\nThe patterns of molt between the four groups were as expected (see Introduction). There\nwas no significant difference in the time of the start of molt between the sexes of non-breeding\nbirds while breeding females began to molt about 2 weeks later than non-breeding birds. It was\nnot possible to assign an exact mean start date for breeding males because only two of the six\nbirds had dropped their primaries by the last sampling date, but this means that the mean start date\nmust be at least 4 weeks later than their partners, and this is in agreement with Czapulak (2002).\n            Prolactin secretion is influenced by both photoperiod and parental behavior (Sharp et al.,\n1998). Increasing photoperiod stimulates secretion, but a longer photoperiod is required than for\nthe stimulation of gonadotrophin secretion. Consequently, in general, peak prolactin\nconcentrations occur later than peak gonadotrophins, and coincide with decreasing gonadotropin\nconcentrations and gonadal regression (Lincoln et al., 1980; Dawson and Goldsmith, 1982).\nBreeding activity can stimulate prolactin secretion above that caused by photoperiod alone\n(Dawson and Goldsmith, 1985). In particular the presence of a nest or eggs can stimulate prolactin\nsecretion (Hall, 1987) so that highest prolactin concentrations are found in incubating birds.\nHowever, prolactin concentrations are also high in the non-incubating sex, if they take part in\nparental care (e.g. Dawson and Goldsmith, 1982).\n            In the Mute swans, highest prolactin concentrations were found in breeding females while\nthey were incubating, and concentrations decreased when the young hatched. In their male\npartners, prolactin was no different from that in non-breeding birds during incubation, but\nincreased when they began to care for the young immediately after they hatched. To the best of\nour knowledge, prolactin has not been measured in Mute swans previously, but it has been\nmeasured in breeding Australian black swans (Cygnus atratus). In this species, males share\nincubation (Brugger and Taborsky, 1994). Nevertheless, the broad pattern of changes in prolactin\nwas similar to that in Mute swans (Goldsmith, 1982a). Concentrations were highest in females\nduring incubation and these decreased when young hatched. Peak values in males occurred at the\nend of incubation.\n            In all four groups of Mute swans, i.e. breeding and non-breeding males and females, molt\nstarted during a period when prolactin concentrations were decreasing. In non-breeding males and\nfemales, prolactin concentrations decreased from the end of May. There was no difference in the\ntiming or magnitude of changes in prolactin between male and female non-breeders, and there was\nno significant difference in the timing of the start of molt. Both sexes started to molt about 4\nweeks after prolactin started to decrease.\n             In breeding females, peak prolactin occurred in the latter half of May, whereas in breeding\nmales, peak prolactin occurred in mid June, 3-5 weeks later than in females. So, although\nprolactin concentrations were no different between males and females in the period between mid\nJune and mid August, values in females had been decreasing for 3-5 weeks longer, and molt\nstarted in females 4 weeks before any male started to molt. Prolactin concentrations were higher\nin breeding birds of both sexes at the start of their molt, than in non-breeding birds when they\nstarted to molt.\n            Although the aim of this study was to test the relationship between prolactin and the\ninitiation of molt, it has also yielded interesting information on the relationship between prolactin\nand reproductive behavior. Prolactin concentrations in incubating females were much higher than\nin non-breeding females, and higher than in their male partners at the same time. This is hardly\nsurprising; prolactin secretion is known to be stimulated by the presence of a nest or eggs, and\nprolactin drives incubation behavior. During the period that their female partners were incubating,\nprolactin concentrations males were no higher than in non-breeding males, but when the eggs\nhatched, prolactin increased. The presence of chicks appears to have stimulated prolactin\nsecretion, and presumably this coincided with a change in behavior from sexual\/territorial to\nparental\/defensive.\n            During the breeding life-history stage of the annual cycle, resources are devoted to the\nproduction of offspring, whereas during the post-breeding stage, the emphasis switches to\nimproving the chances of survival of the individual. There is a trade-off between the two (Stearns,\n1992) and this is sometimes apparent in the timing and progress of molt. Birds that prolong the\nbreeding stage start to molt later (Morton and Morton, 1990; Hinsley et al., 2003). Birds that start\nto molt later may molt more rapidly and this may lead to poorer quality plumage, thus decreasing\nchances of survival (Nilsson and Svensson, 1996; Dawson et al., 2000). In most birds, molt\nprogresses through the sequential loss of feathers and molt rate is increased by molting more\nfeathers at any one time (Dawson, 2004). In waterfowl such as swans, all of the flight feathers are\nmolted at the same time. Breeding swans started to molt later than non-breeding birds. Whether\nthis results in a more rapid molt, e.g. by growing individual feathers more rapidly is, to the best of\nour knowledge, not known. Perhaps simply molting later in the year imposes a penalty on\nindividual survival. Whatever the mechanism, prolactin may play a key role in this trade-off\n(Sockman et al., 2006). Prolactin encourages behaviors related to production of offspring, and a\ndecrease in prolactin permits processes related to self-preservation.\n            In conclusion, the data from Mute swans do not disprove the hypothesis that the start of\nmolt is related to the timing of peak prolactin, i.e. the time values start to decrease, rather than to\nabsolute values. Decreasing prolactin concentrations in some way either stimulate or permit molt\nto start. This is a mechanism that could minimize breeding\/molt overlap but at the same time\nensure that molt starts as soon as breeding activity has finished. The exact nature of this\nmechanism remains to be determined.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are extremely grateful to Mrs. C.

For breeding birds, the\nsame pairs were sampled repeatedly (n = 6). For non-breeding birds, individuals were caught at\nrandom (n = 4-7 for males and n = 4-9 for females). Each point represents the means \u00b1 S.E.M.\nThe solid squares represent the date at which molt started in females and the open squares molt\nstart for males. Breeding males started to molt at least 4 weeks later than their partners but there\nwas no significant difference in molt start date between male and female non-breeders.\n"}
