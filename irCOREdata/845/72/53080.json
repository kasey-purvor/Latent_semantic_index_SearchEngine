Introduction \nThe economic implications of wear are a cause of considerable concern to building and civil \nengineers alike who employ concrete in a broad area of applications. Furthermore, in the present and \nforeseeable world economy, material conservation is becoming a matter of increasing importance. \nWear is a major cause of concrete wastage in many application areas where over time and as a direct \nconsequence of the operating environment, the concrete becomes corroded and\/or contaminated. This \nultimately necessitates the arduous and costly undertaking of repairing or replacing the affected \nconcrete either by physical or mechanical means. Clearly, any means by which the life of the concrete \ncould be extended would be of great interest to all engineers, since any reduction in concrete wear \ncould effect significant economic savings. \nOwing to their unique characteristics, lasers have the propensity to be employed for the non-contact \nprocessing of materials, such as concrete, which are otherwise difficult to process. To date, many \nstudies have been carried out to investigate the laser processing of concrete. Most of the research, \nhowever, has concentrated on the laser cutting of concrete and reinforced concrete using high power \nCO2 lasers, most prominently with regard to nuclear reactor decommissioning [1-3]. Also, as part of \nnuclear plant decommissioning, Li et al. [4-7] conducted research to determine the workability of \nseveral laser techniques for sealing\/fixing radioactive contamination onto concrete surfaces. Such \ntechniques experimented with were: direct glazing of the concrete, single and multiple layer fusion \ncladding and combined chemical\/fusion cladding. Work by Sugimoto et al. [8] focused upon \nmodifying the surface appearance and surface properties of cement based materials using a high \npower CO2 laser. The laser treatment produced novel surfaces, with surface textures, properties and \nappearance unique to laser treatment. The resultant physical characteristics and mechanical behaviour \nof the post-process cement based materials was later fully characterised by Wignarajah et al. [9]. \nBorodina et al. [10] has carried out investigations into the structural changes within the composition \nof zirconia concrete caused by surface exposure to CO2 laser radiation, detailing microstructural \nchanges, phase changes and the absorptivity characteristics. In all of these studies, spallation and \nexcessive cracking and porosity formation were found to be major problems undermining the \nperformance of the laser treated surface layer. \n 4 \nIn contrast, more detailed and comprehensive studies conducted by Lawrence and Li have \ninvestigated the feasibility and characteristics of high power diode laser (HPDL) generated glazes on \nthe ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface of concrete [11, 12]. In further work Lawrence and Li \nstudied the generation and carried out a comparison of the glazes generated with both CO2 and \nHPDL\u2019s [13, 14].  \nThis present work is concerned with establishing the wear characteristics of a glaze generated on the \nOPC surface layer of concrete by means of a HPDL. This is of particular interest since the inherent \ncompactness of the HPDL enables it to be portable. Other industrial lasers only allow the workpiece \nto be processed at a dedicated laser work station, whereas on the other hand, the HPDL can be used \nfor on-site processing. Thus the of the HPDL for the processing of building materials may lead to \nmany new practical applications. \n2. Experimental procedures \n2.1 Materials \nThe concrete studied in the experiments was the ubiquitous OPC based concrete, with the usual \u2018as \ncast\u2019 OPC surface of concrete being the subject of the HPDL irradiation. The OPC surface of the \nconcrete had a thickness of 2.5 mm. For the purpose of experimental convenience the as-received \nconcrete blocks were sectioned into squares (120 x 120 x 20 mm) prior to laser treatment. The \ncomposition of the concrete bulk by volume is as follows: 20mm limestone aggregate (40%), 10mm \nlimestone aggregate (14%), zone M sand (28.5%), OPC (10.5%) and particulate fine aggregate (7%). \n2.2 Laser processing procedure \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed Ltd.), emitting at 810 nm \u00b120 nm and \noperating in the CW mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-60 W. The laser beam was \ndelivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of \nwhich was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC gantry \ntable. The concrete sample blocks were irradiated using the defocused high order mode HPDL beam \nwith a beam spot diameter of 2 mm and laser powers (measured at the workpiece using a Power \nWizard power meter) of 20-55 W. As shown in Fig. 1, the defocused laser beam was fired across the \n 5 \nsurfaces of the concrete samples by traversing the samples beneath  the beam using the x- and y-axis \nof the CNC gantry table at speeds ranging from 60-600 mm\/min. Area coverage of the OPC surface \nof the concrete was achieved by overlapping the glaze tracks. The overlap was 0.3 mm. The laser \noptics were protected by means of a coaxially blown O2 shield gas jet a rate of 5 l\/min.  \nAs detailed comprehensively by Lawrence and Li [11, 12], HPDL interaction with the OPC surface \nof concrete effected the vitrification of the surface, resulting in the generation of a glaze of around \n750 \u00b5m in thickness. The surface of the glazes typically exhibited an undulating morphology, with \nthe undulations being regular in both periodicity and intensity. In addition, the surface displayed very \nfew microcracks and few porosities. As with any laser surface treatment process, HPDL treatment of \nthe OPC surface of concrete resulted in the generation of an attendant heat affected zone (HAZ). In \nprevious work conducted by Lawrence and Li [11-14] this HAZ was identified as being comprised of \nunslaked lime (CaO), the formation of which was due to the dehydration of the OPC as a result of the \nheat generated when the HPDL beam was incident with the OPC surface. \n2.3 Wear testing procedure \nTo determine the wear resistance characteristics of the HPDL generated OPC glaze and also those of \nan untreated OPC surface, wear tests were conducted in accordance with Fig. 2. For experimental \npurposes the concrete was cut into smaller pieces (25 mm x 25 mm). Half of the samples were then \nlaser treated. All the samples were then weighed. The samples were then clamped individually in the \nvice of a common shaping machine. A steel abrader was attached to the floating head of the shaping \nmachine and moved cyclically back and forth across the untreated and HPDL glazed OPC surfaces. \nThe total distance moved in one cycle was 6 mm while the traverse speed was 180 mm\/min. By \napplying weights to the floating head a frictional force of 60 N was generated. The samples were \nsubjected to the frictional force for 8 hours, being removed from the machine and weighed at two \nhourly intervals. \n \n3. Results \n 6 \n3.1 Wear characteristics in normal environmental conditions \nGenerally, the wear resistance of any material is primarily related to the hardness of the material in \ncomparison with the that of other materials with which it subsequently comes into contact with [15]. \nHowever, wear resistance is not directly proportional to hardness, nor does it always increase with \nhardness [16]. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between weight loss and the friction time for HPDL \ngenerated OPC glazes and the untreated OPC surfaces. As is evident from Fig. 3, the wear resistance \nof the HPDL generated OPC glaze displays a significant increase in wear resistance over the \nuntreated OPC surface, with the weight loss being approximately 2 times lower after 4 hours, and 3 \ntimes lower after 8 hours. \n3.2 Wear characteristics in corrosive environments \nConcrete surfaces are often subjected to corrosive substances, either as part of the normal service \nenvironment and\/or as a result of routine cleaning. Therefore corrosion resistance tests based upon \nBS 6431 [17] were conducted using nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and Premier Products MP9 \ndetergent cleaner. The experiments were carried out by dropping small amounts of the corrosive \nagents, in the concentration ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10%, on to the untreated and HPDL \nglazed OPC surfaces at hourly intervals for four hours. The samples were then examined optically \nand mechanically tested in terms of compressive strength and wear. High concentrations of the \nvarious corrosive agents were used principally to accelerate the tests. However, in practice 60% nitric \nacid is used within the nuclear processing industry as a solvent for nuclear fuels [18].  \nAll three reagents in the concentrations 80%, 60% and 40% were seen to immediately attack the \nuntreated OPC surface, with the nitric acid and sodium hydroxide attacking with greater severity than \nthe detergent. On the other hand, the HPDL glazed OPC surfaces exhibited no discernible changes in  \neither morphology or microstructure. In addition, no signs of devitrification due to corrosion were \ndiscernible.  \nTests conducted according to ASTM C579-91 [19] revealed that exposure of the untreated OPC \nsurface to the reagents had a significant effect on the compressive strength and the wear resistance of \nthe OPC. As one can see from Fig. 4, exposure of the OPC to nitric acid and sodium hydroxide in the \nconcentrations 40-80% resulted in an average loss of compressive strength of approximately 19-37%. \n 7 \nIn the case of the detergent a discernible loss in compressive strength only occurred with \nconcentrations above 40%. Here the average loss in compressive strength for concentrations in the \nrange 60-80% was approximately 17%. This compares with no discernible difference in either the \nwear resistance or the compressive strength of the HPDL glazed OPC surfaces.  \nFig. 5 shows the variation in wear resistance of the untreated OPC surface when exposed to the \nreagents with an 80% concentration. As one can see, the wear resistance is significantly affected, \nparticularly through interaction with the nitric acid and the sodium hydroxide. Here the weight loss \nwas approximately 5 times higher than for the unexposed OPC after 4 hours, and approximately 11 \ntimes higher after 8 hours for the nitric acid. In the case of the detergent the weight loss was marginal \nafter both 4 and 8 hours. \n4. Discussion \nThe results of the wear tests show clearly that the HPDL generated OPC glaze exhibited better wear \nresistance characteristics than the untreated OPC surface. In particular, a considerable improvement \nin wear rate was observed when the tests were conducted in corrosive environments. The marked \ndifference in wear rate between the HPDL glazed and untreated OPC surface, in both normal and \ncorrosive environments, can be ascribed entirely to the difference in structure of the two surfaces. \nWhereas the HPDL generated glaze is fully amorphous in nature (Fig. 6(b), the untreated OPC is \ncomprised of a porous polycrystalline structure (Fig. 6(a). As such, HPDL beam interaction with the \nsurface of the OPC has led to vitrification of the surface as Fig. 7 shows, creating a much more dense \nand consolidated surface. In addition, the HPDL generated glaze is considerably harder than the \nuntreated OPC surface, a respective value of 6 compared to 2 on the Mohs scale. Consequently, these \ntwo improvements in the nature of the surface of the OPC will inherently afford the HPDL generated \nglaze better wear resistance over an untreated OPC surface. Furthermore, owing to the amorphous \nnature of the HPDL generated glaze, the glaze will naturally posses a greater resistance to corrosive \nreagents than the polycrystalline structure of the untreated surface of the OPC which is readily \nattacked by acids and alkalis [20]. Indeed, from a microscopic examination of the HPDL generated \nglaze, no signs of devitrification due to corrosion were discernible. \n 8 \nIt is believed that the wear rate of the HPDL generated glaze could be improved if the formation of \nporosities on the glaze surface could be substantially reduced, or even avoided altogether. As is \nevident from Fig. 8, blister type porosities on the surface of the HPDL generated glaze were ever \npresent features of the glaze morphology. For all instances of porosity formation the mechanism \nbehind their development is the consequence of gas escaping from within the melt and disrupting the \nsurface [21]. With regard to the OPC glaze, the gas is likely to be CO2 [9]. If the laser energy density \nincident on the OPC is too low, then the generated CO2 can not escape from the molten OPC surface \neasily because of the high viscosity of the melt. As such, when the CO2 eventually does penetrate the \nmelt surface, the resultant porosity is not filled by the flow of the melt; since the insufficient energy \ndensity is unable to maintain a high enough temperature for an adequate length of time and thus \ndecrease the overall viscosity of the melt [22]. In this case the porosities formed are typically small \nand shallow, being regular in both periodicity and intensity. On the other hand, if the laser energy \ndensity incident on the OPC surface of the concrete is too high, then boiling of the surface may \nhappen. At the same time an increase in CO2 formation may occur within the melt. These individual \npockets of CO2 formation may combine and rise to surface of the melt. Once the energy density \ndecreases (as the laser traverses away), then the additional CO2 will attempt to escape from the \nmolten surface. However, the solidifying melt will prevent this, causing bubbles to form. The \nexcessive CO2 gas pressure will firstly cause the bubbles to expand and ultimately rupture the walls \nof the bubbles, creating a sharp \u2018knife edge\u2019 porosity [3, 9]. These types of porosity are usually large, \ndeep and randomly spaced. Clearly, the physical characteristics of the knife-edge porosities makes \nthem more susceptible to wear at a higher rate than the main body of the glaze. Thus, if knife-edge \nporosity generation could be avoided than improvements in the wear rate of the HPDL generated \nglaze could be realised.  \nThe generally superior mechanical and chemical performance of the laser generated OPC glazes over \nthe untreated OPC suggests that the life characteristics of the OPC glazes may also be superior to \nthose of untreated OPC. Yet in any analysis of the wear life of the two materials, the in-situ relative \nthickness of the HPDL generated glaze and the untreated OPC layer on concrete must be considered \nin order to give a true interpretation of the actual life characteristics. This is particularly true when \nconsidering the wear resistance (with and without exposure to corrosive chemical agents). \nConsequently the increase in wear life can be given by \n 9 \n Increase in wear life =  \nLaser glaze wear life\nUntreated OPC wear life\n (1) \nwhere, Wear life =  \nDensity .  Thickness (mg.cm .cm)\nWear rate (mg.cm .h )\n-3\n-2 -1\n (1a) \nTable 1 summarises the wear rate details and the nominal life increase of the HPDL generated glaze \nover the untreated OPC surface. As is clearly evident from Table 1, the HPDL generated glaze \neffected an increase in actual life over the untreated OPC surface regardless of the environment. \nFurther, it can be seen that the increase in actual life of the HPDL generated glaze over the untreated \nOPC surface varies considerably depending upon the working environment. Notwithstanding this, \narguably the most common working environment for an OPC surface would involve some contact \nwith at least detergent acids, therefore yielding significant economic savings since a HPDL glazed \nOPC surface lasts around 2.5-times longer than one which is unglazed.  \n4. Conclusion \nThe wear characteristics of a glaze generated on the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface                         \nof concrete was using a 60 W-cw high power diode laser (HPDL) have been determined. Within  both \nnormal and corrosive (detergent, NaOH and HNO3) environmental conditions the wear rate                \nof the HPDL generated glaze was 3.5 mg.cm-2.h-1. In contrast, the untreated OPC surface of               \nconcrete exhibited a wear rate of  9.8 mg.cm-2.h-1 in normal environmental conditions and 18.5, 73.8 \nand 114.8 mg.cm-2.h-1 when exposed to detergent, NaOH and HNO3 respectively. Life assessment \ntesting revealed that the HPDL generated glaze had an increase in wear life of 1.3 to 14.8 times over \nan untreated OPC surface, depending upon the corrosive environment. It is believed that the \neconomic and material benefits to be gained from the deployment of such an effective and efficient \ncoating on OPC could be significant. \nThe reasons for these marked improvements in the wear resistance and wear life of the HPDL \ngenerated glaze over the untreated OPC surface of concrete can be attributed to: \ni. The vitrification of the OPC surface after HPDL treatment which subsequently created a much \nmore dense and consolidated surface. \n 10 \nii. The generation of a surface with improved microstructure and phase which is more resistant in \ncorrosive environments. \n \n  \n \n 11 \nReferences \n1. K. Sugita, M. Mori, T.
