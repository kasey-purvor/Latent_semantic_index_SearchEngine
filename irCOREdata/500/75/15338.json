INTRODUCTION\nOne of the major trends of modern semiconductor re-\nsearch is toward the achievement of electron and photon\nstates of low dimensionality.1 Electrons and holes can be\nlocalized in semiconductor heterostructures, such as quantum\nwells, wires, and dots, which have spatial sizes of several\nnanometers, and which are comparable with the de Broglie\nwavelength of an electron. Similarly, photons can be local-\nized by periodic modulation of the refractive index of the\nmedium in different types of microcavities,2,3 with a feature\nsize of the order of a micrometer or below, and comparable\nwith the wavelength of light.\nQuantum wells, providing the confinement of electrons or\nexcitons in only one direction, can be fabricated by different\nepitaxial techniques. Quantum dots, providing full three-\ndimensional confinement of excitons, have been obtained by\nthe technique of spontaneous formation during epitaxial\ngrowth.4,5 At present, the most developed method of fabri-\ncating quantum wires ~QW\u2019s!, where excitons are localized\nin two dimensions, is growth on V-grooved substrates,6 but\nonly QW\u2019s parallel to the substrate can be obtained by this\ntechnique. A very promising approach to fabricate QW\u2019s ori-\nented perpendicularly to the substrate surface is to stack a\nlarge number of layers of vertically coupled quantum dots.7\nDue to the strong vertical coupling between the dots, the\nelectron states in such structures are of a quasi-one-\ndimensional type.\nThe technology of the fabrication of planar microcavities,\nwhere one-dimensional localization of light occurs, is well\nestablished, and the interaction of quantum-well excitons and\nlocalized photon states in such structures has been the sub-\nject of intensive studies in the last decade.8\u201310 By providing\na substantial enhancement of light-matter interaction, micro-\ncavities make possible an experimental investigation of vari-\nous fundamental effects, such as the propagation of\ntwo-dimensional exciton-polaritons,9 vacuum field Rabi\nsplitting,11 enhancement of spontaneous emission,12 etc.\nThe interaction of quasi-one- and quasi-zero-dimensional\nphotons with excitons has been a subject of considerable\ninterest in the scientific community in the last decade. First,\nthe three-dimensional confinement of photons was achieved\nin pillar microcavities for certain modes.13\u201317 The theory of\nlight-matter interaction in this kind of structure was recently\ndeveloped.18 The semiclassical model of light-exciton\ncoupling in gratings of quantum wires was also developed19\nand compared with experimental data on the optical spec-\ntroscopy of gratings of quantum wires.20,21 This approach\nwas extended for a description of the optical spectra of mi-\ncrocavities containing quantum wires.22 Recently, the two-\ndimensional localization of light by a cylindrical multilay-\nered structure was demonstrated,2 and the optical eigenmode\nstructure of such a cylindrical microcavity was analyzed\ntheoretically.23\nThe aim of the present work is to develop a formalism for\na description of light-matter interaction in a system with cy-\nlindrical symmetry and containing an embedded quantum\nwire, and to investigate the exciton-polariton state originat-\ning from the coupling of a one-dimensional ~1D! quantum\nwire exciton to a 1D photon mode in a cylindrical microcav-\nity. The type of model structure considered is shown in Fig.\n1. It has an infinitely long cylindrical microcavity with its\naxis of symmetry, taken parallel to the z axis, formed by a\ncentral cylinder with a radius of the order of the wavelength\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 15 MAY 2000-IIVOLUME 61, NUMBER 20\nPRB 610163-1829\/2000\/61~20!\/13791~7!\/$15.00 13 791 \u00a92000 The American Physical Society\nof light, and surrounded by a cylindrical Bragg reflector.24 A\nrelatively thin cylindrical quantum wire is placed at the cen-\nter of the structure. Corresponding experimental structures\nwill be susceptible to a degradation of their cavity Q factors\ndue to the out-of-plane scattering assosiated with their finite\nlength. Therefore, the parameters of experimental cylindrical\nmicrocavities of this type should be chosen to minimize such\nlight scattering,2 or some photonic band-gap structure should\nbe used to suppress the scattering.\nII. BASIC EQUATIONS\nA. Reflection of the cylindrical light wave by a quantum wire\nConsider an E-polarized cylindrical wave of a frequency\nv incident on a cylindrical quantum wire. E polarization\nmeans in this case that the electric-field vector is directed\nalong the axis of the quantum wire.25 The medium is char-\nacterized by a background dielectric constant e . The electro-\nmagnetic field of the diverging cylindrical wave has the form\nEz5AHm\n(1)~kr!exp~ imw!,\nHw5iA\u00abAHm(1)8~kr!exp~ imw!, ~1!\nHr5~mc\/rv!AHm\n(1)~kr!exp~ imw!,\nwhere A is the constant, m is an aztimuthal number, Hm\n(1)(kr)\nis the Hankel function of the first type, c is the light velocity\nin vacuum, and k5Ae(v\/c). The electromagnetic field of\nthe converging cylindrical wave has the form\nEz5AHm\n(2)~kr!exp~ imw!,\nHw5iA\u00abAHm(2)8~kr!exp~ imw!, ~18!\nHr5~mc\/rv!AHm\n(2)~kr!exp~ imw!,\nwhere Hm\n(2)(kr) is the Hankel function of the second type. In\nthe following we assume the light wave is propagates in the\nplane orthogonal to the wire, and consider only the exciton\nground state in the wire, which is characterized by zero an-\ngular momentum.\nThe electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the quantum\nwire is described by Maxwell\u2019s equations when the excitonic\ncontribution to the dielectric polarization Pexc is taken into\naccount19:\nD\u2019Ez1k2Ez524p\nv2\nc2\nPexc~rW !. ~2!\nHere\nPexc~rW !5E x~v ,rW ,rW 8!EW ~rW 8!drW 8 ~3!\nis the nonlocal dielectric susceptibility, whose dependence\non the exciton envelope function is given by\nx~v ,rW ,rW 8!5x\u02dc ~v!F~rW !F~rW 8!, ~4!\nwhere F(rW ) is related to the envelope function of the exciton\nground state by F(rW )5ALC(rW ,rW ), and L is the length of the\nwire.\nSubstituting formula ~5! into Eq. ~4!, one can rewrite the\nexcitonic polarization as\nPexc~rW !5x\u02dc ~v!F~rW !L , ~5!\nwhere Lm5*F(rW )E(rW )drW ~for details, see Ref. 19!. Given\nthe cylindrical symmetry of the exciton ground state, the\nintegral in Eq. ~5! is nonzero only in the case of cylindrical\nlight waves having zero angular momentum. Thus in the fol-\nlowing we limit the discussion to that situation only.

Eigenmodes of a cylindrical microcavity with an embedded\nquantum wire\nAn electromagnetic field in a central cylinder containing a\nquantum wire located at the symmetry axis has the form\nE~r!5H0\n(2)~kr!1rQWH0\n(1)~kr!, ~23!\nand can be represented as two-dimensional vector\n@H0\n(2)(kr),rQWH0(1)(kr)# , whose components are the magni-\ntudes of the converging and diverging waves.\nAt the boundary of the central cylinder, which is at radius\nr0, the ratio of the amplitudes of the converging and diverg-\ning waves is given by the reflection coefficient rb of the\nPRB 61 13 793EXCITON POLARITONS IN A CYLINDRICAL . . .\ncylindrical Bragg mirror, which provides the optical confine-\nment in the structure, and can represented as C(rb,1), where\nC is the constant.\nThe equation defining the frequencies of the eigenmodes\nof the cylindrical microcavity with an embedded quantum\nwire can be obtained by equating the two vectors defined\nabove, to give\nH0\n(2)~kr0!5rbrQWH0\n(1)~kr0!. ~24!\nIn the case of negligible decay of light in the structure, Eq.\n~24! can be reduced to\narg@H0\n(1)~kr0!#\n2arg@H0\n(2)~kr0!#1arg~rb!1arg~rQW!52p j .\n~25!\nFurther simplifications can be achieved by use of\nthe approximate relations arg@H0\n(1)(kr0)#>kr02p \/4 and\narg(H0(2)(kr0))>2kr01p\/4, which will be valid if the in-\nternal radius of the cavity exceeds the wavelength of light.\nThe phase of the reflection coefficient of the Bragg mirror at\nthe Bragg frequency can be approximated by the simplified\nexpression,27 which is also valid in the cylindrical case,24\narg~rb!5b\nv2vb\nvb\n, ~26!\nwhere b5pn1n2 \/A\u00ab(n22n1), and n1 and n1 are the refrac-\ntive indices of the layers forming the mirror.\nThe reflection coefficient of the quantum wire can be rep-\nresented in form\nrQW5\n~vex2v!\n21~G22G0\n2!1i2G0~vex2v!\n~vex2v!\n21~G1G0!\n2 ~27!\nThe phase can be found as\narg~rQW!5arctanS 2G0~vex2v!\n~vex2v!\n21~G1G0!\n2D . ~28!\nLet us now assume that the exciton-polariton eigenmode fre-\nquencies are significantly different from the frequency of the\nexciton resonance vex ~which is the case in planar micro-\ncavities in the strong coupling regime!, so that (G1G0)\n!uvex2vemu where vem is the eigenmode frequency of the\nstructure.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 2 shows the spectral dependence of the phase and\nthe squared modulus of the amplitude reflection coefficient\nof the incident cylindrical converging wave for different val-\nFIG. 2. Spectral dependence of the phase ~a! and the square\nmodulus of the amplitude reflection coefficient ~b! of a converging\nE-polarized cylindrical wave incident on the quantum wire, and\ncharacterized by azimuthal number m50. Curves for different val-\nues of G are shown: dotted line, G50; solid line, G5G0; short-\ndashed line, G52G0; long-dashed line, G55G0; and dash-dotted\nline, G510G0. The inset shows the power reflection coefficient at\nthe resonant frequency vs the value of non radiative damping G .\n13 794 PRB 61M. A. KALITEEVSKI et al.\nues of G . Note that in the case G50, the magnitude of the\nreflection coefficient is equal to unity, while the phase\nchanges strongly in the vicinity of the exciton resonance.\nThe latter effect can be easily understood if one takes into\naccount that it describes the dissipation of energy, and in the\ncase of a cylindrical wire and G50, the entire energy of the\nconverging wave must reappear in the diverging wave. This\nis because any energy in the converging wave that is not\nabsorbed reaches the line r50, and then contributes to the\nwave diverging from there. For G5G0 the reflection spec-\ntrum exhibits a dip that becomes zero at its minimum. With\na further increase of G , the dips in the spectra become shal-\nlower and broader. When the frequency of the incident wave\nis tuned to the exciton resonance frequency, the amplitude\nreflection coefficient can be represented in the form rQW\n5(G2G0)\/(G1G0) ~see the inset in Fig. 2!. The total ab-\nsorption of the incident radiation is a feature of the cylindri-\ncal system which is absent in planar microcavities.\nFigure 3 presents absorption spectra of the cylindrical mi-\ncrocavity with an embedded quantum wire shown in the fig-\nure inset. The model microcavity consists of a central core\nhaving a refractive index of 3.0, surrounded by a cylindrical\nBragg reflector, as described in the figure caption. The pa-\nrameters of the microcavity are chosen to tune one of the\noptical eigenmodes of the cavity without the quantum wire to\nthe wire exciton frequency. The value of the radiative damp-\ning is G050.0001vex , which is typical of the relative values\nof the oscillator strength and exciton resonance frequency for\nreal quantum wires.\nThe spectral positions of the absorption peaks correspond\nto the eigenmode frequencies in the system. If the exciton\nbroadening is much smaller than the Rabi splitting D , the\nabsorption spectra exhibit two peaks with center frequencies\nthat are quite insensitive to the value of the nonradiative\ndamping factor G , but do show significant variations in their\nlinewidths and amplitudes. The coexistence of two peaks in\nthe spectra is evidence of the strong-coupling regime.8 How-\never, when G is comparable to D , the weak-coupling regime\noccurs, and the two peaks in the absorption spectra merge\ninto one broad peak, centered at the frequency of the exciton\nresonance. These properties are analogous to those for the\ninteraction of photon and exciton modes in a planar micro-\ncavity containing a quantum well.1\nThe dependence of the optical eigenmode frequency on\nthe central cylinder radius r0 of an empty cylindrical micro-\nFIG. 4.

Absorption spectrum of a cylindrical microcavity with\nthe quantum wire for a converging E-polarized cylindrical wave\nwith azimuthal number m50. Different values of are shown: solid\nline, G5G0; dotted line, G52G0; short-dashed line, G510G0;\nlong-dashed line, G520G0; and dash-dotted line, G550G0. The\ninset shows a schematic view of the cross section of the structure: a\ncentral core with the quantum wire in the center, surrounded by\ncylindrical Bragg reflector. The refractive indices of the central\ncore, outer media, and the two layers of the Bragg reflector, shown\nin gray, are equal to 3.0, while refractive index of the three white\nlayers are equal to 1.0. The thicknesses of the layers of the reflector\nare a quarter of the wavelength corresponding to the exciton reso-\nnance frequency vex . The radius of the central core is chosen to\nprovide an exact tuning of the optical eigenmode frequency v0 j to\nthe exciton resonance frequency and satisfies the relation\nr0vex\/2p c50.37015.\nPRB 61 13 795EXCITON POLARITONS IN A CYLINDRICAL . . .\ncavity exhibits a series of branches, as shown in Fig. 4. In\neach branch, the frequency increases with decreasing radius\nr0. The splitting between two neighboring branches charac-\nterized by the same azimuthal number is given by formula\n~31!. By changing the radius r0 it is possible to tune the\noptical eigenmode frequency v0 j into resonance with the\nquantum wire exciton. The coupling of a photon and an ex-\nciton state leads to the anticrossing behavior seen in the fig-\nure. The optical eigenmode branch crosses the exciton reso-\nnance frequency vex when the radius r0 approaches the\nvalue satisfying the relation r0vex\/2p c50.37. Figure 4 also\nshows another anticrossing at r0vex\/2p c\u2019 0.54, where the\nexciton state couples with another optical eigenmode.\nThe change in shape of the absorption spectrum with\nvariation of the radius r0 around the value corresponding to\nthe first anticrossing is illustrated by the solid lines in Fig. 5.\nWhen the detuning of the exciton and the photon modes is\nstrong there are two distinct peaks in the absorption spectra,\nand the frequencies of these two peaks nearly correspond to\nthe uncoupled exciton and photon states @Fig. 5~a!#. Tuning\nthe optical mode to the exciton frequency leads to the shift of\nboth resonances which exhibits identical shape in the case of\nprecise tuning @Fig. 5~c!#. The splitting between the peaks in\nthis case is almost identical to the value of the vacuum-field\nRabi splitting D given by Eq. ~33!. The dotted curve in Fig.\n5~c!, which corresponds to the value of r0 well removed\nfrom the anticrossing, illustrates how much weaker the exci-\ntonic absortion is when the exciton and optical modes are\nessentially uncoupled.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nExciton-light interactions in a system of cylindrical sym-\nmetry have been theoretically analyzed using the nonlocal\ndielectric response model. An interesting peculiarity of the\ncylindrical system is that a converging cylindrical electrody-\nnamic wave can be fully absorbed by quantum wire exciton.\nAn equation for the energies of the polariton states originat-\ning from the optical eigenmode of the cylindrical microcav-\nity and the quantum wire exciton has been obtained, and\nsimplified approximate formulas have also been derived. The\nstate energies exist on a series of anticrossing branches when\nplotted as a function of the inner radius of the microcavity.\nThe transition between weak- and strong-coupling regimes\nhas also been illustrated, and is similar to the case of a quan-\ntum well in a planar microcavity.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was partly funded by an EPRSC research grant,\nand partly by RFBR and NATO Linkage HTEC Grant No.\n974673.\n1 Confined Exciton and Photons: New Physics and Devices, edited\nby E.
