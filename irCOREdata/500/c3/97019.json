When a superconducting slab of constant thickness, between\nthe planes x = \u2212d and x = d, is submitted to an exterior magnetic field (0, 0, H), the\nstate of the slab can be described by the real functions (\u03a8(x), A(x)) satisfying the\nGinzburg\u2013Landau system:\n(GLd)\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1\n\u03ba2\u03a8\n\u2032\u2032 = \u03a8(\u03a82 +A2 \u2212 1) in (\u2212d, d),\n\u03a8\u2032(\u00b1d) = 0,\nA\u2032\u2032 = \u03a82A in (\u2212d, d),\nA\u2032(\u00b1d) = H.\nHere, \u03a8 is the superconducting order parameter, which can be thought of as an av-\neraged wave function of the superconducting electrons, and (0, A, 0) is the magnetic\nvector potential, so that (0, 0, A\u2032) is the magnetic field. This model was first intro-\nduced by Ginzburg and Landau [16]. For a more detailed description of the model,\none may refer to [3], [12], or [14] and the references therein.\nNotice that \u03a8 \u2261 0 and A = H(x + e) is always a solution for any real e. From\nnow on we will call this a normal solution. It is well known that when H is too large,\nsuperconductivity is destroyed and the only solution of (GLd) is the normal solution.\nLet us first recall some basic properties of solutions of (GLd).\nProposition 1.1.

Symmetric (solid) and asymmetric (dashed) solutions of (GLd) showing (a) \u03a8 and (b)\nA, for d = 3, \u03ba = 0.9.\n(iii) there exist x1 and x2 with \u2212d \u2264 x1 \u2264 d0 \u2264 x2 \u2264 d and x0 \u2208 [x1, x2] such\nthat \u03a8\u2032 is increasing on [\u2212d, x1]\u222a [x2, d] and decreasing on [x1, x2], and \u03a8 is\nincreasing on [\u2212d, x0] and decreasing on [x0, d].\nThe proof of (i) and (ii) can be found, for instance, in [7] and that of (iii) in [1].\nThere are two types of physically important solutions of (GLd): symmetric solu-\ntions and asymmetric solutions. We define a symmetric solution to be a solution of\n(GLd) such that \u03a8 > 0, \u03a8 is even, and A is odd on [\u2212d, d]. We define an asymmet-\nric solution to be a solution of (GLd) which satisfies \u03a8 > 0 on [\u2212d, d], yet which is\nnot symmetric; that is, \u03a8\u2032(0) \b= 0 or A(0) \b= 0. Typical symmetric and asymmetric\nsolutions for \u03a8 and A are shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b), respectively.\nIn sufficiently large slabs it has been discovered experimentally (see [21] or [23])\nthat as H is decreased superconductivity nucleates first in surface layers of thickness\n1\/\u03ba. These surface layers can be explained using the asymmetric solution (GLd); in a\ndecreasing field, the first solution to bifurcate from the normal state is the asymmetric\nsolution, which is concentrated near the boundary [20].\nIt is interesting to study the bifurcation diagrams of solutions of (GLd), which\nshow the norm of \u03a8 as a function of H (see, for instance, [15], [18], or [22]). In\nparticular, the number of intersections of the bifurcation curve with the line H = H0\nprovides the number of solutions of (GLd) for each H0. (Note in this respect that\nthe asymmetric solutions come in pairs: if \u03a8(x) is a solution of (GLd), then so is\n\u03a8(\u2212x).) These bifurcation diagrams for both symmetric and asymmetric solutions\nhave been computed in [3] for various values of the parameters d and \u03ba. For symmetric\nsolutions we refer the reader to [3] and the asymptotic analysis in [2]. For the branch of\nasymmetric solutions it is found in [3] that there are two possible behaviors according\nto the type of bifurcation, as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. In both figures, the branch\nof symmetric solutions is that bifurcating from the normal solution at the smaller value\nof H, and the bifurcation of the asymmetric solutions from the symmetric solution\nis illustrated by a square. (We call this the secondary bifurcation\u2014the bifurcation\nfrom the normal solution being the primary bifurcation.) In the case of Figure 2 the\nbifurcation of asymmetric solutions is subcritical1 and there is at most one pair of\n1Since we are not investigating stability here, we need to assign a \u201cdirection\u201d to the bifurcation\nto use the labels sub- and supercritical; we choose the direction of decreasing H. This definition\ncoincides with the usual definition based on the stability properties of the asymmetric bifurcation\ninvestigated in [10], [11].\nASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS OF A SECONDARY BIFURCATION 1159\n\u03c8 ||\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\nH\nFig. 2.

They indicate that the\n(d, \u03ba) plane is the union of three connected sets A0, A1, and A2: In A0 there are no\nasymmetric solutions, in A1 the behavior of the asymmetric branch of Figure 2 holds,\nand in A2 the behavior of the asymmetric branch of Figure 3.\nIn [3] the authors make the following conjecture.\nConjecture 1.2 (see [3]). There exist two continuous functions \u03ba4(d) and \u03ba5(d)\nseparating the (d, \u03ba) plane into three connected regions A0, A1, and A2. There exists\nexactly one point d\u2217 called the quintuple point (with approximate value 1.23), such\nthat \u03ba4(d\n\u2217) = \u03ba5(d\u2217) = \u03ba\u2217.

The\ncurve \u03ba4(d) is the curve across which the primary asymmetric bifurcation from the normal solution\ndisappears, while \u03ba5(d) is the curve across which it switches from being subcritical to supercritical.\n0.90, and \u03ba5(d) is defined and monotone decreasing on [d\n\u2217,\u221e) with limd\u2192\u221e \u03ba5(d) =\n\u03baas \n 0.4.\nThe curve \u03ba4(d) is the curve across which the asymmetric bifurcation disappears,\nwhile \u03ba5(d) is the curve across which it switches from being subcritical to supercritical.\nThe point (d\u2217, \u03ba\u2217) is known as the quintuple point since, as shown numerically in [3],\na third curve \u03ba1(d) also passes through this point, dividing the plane into five regions\nlocally (see Figure 5). This curve is the curve across which the bifurcation of the\nsymmetric solution switches from being subcritical to supercritical, and it has been\nanalyzed asymptotically in [2]. Indeed, once we know that the curves \u03ba4 and \u03ba5 meet,\nit is clear that \u03ba1 must also pass through this point.\nThe secondary bifurcation (shown as a square in Figures 2 and 3) in which the\ntwo asymmetric solutions and the symmetric solution reconnect to become a single\nsymmetric solution will be our primary interest in this paper. We will be concerned\nwith the situation in which the secondary bifurcation is close to the primary bifurca-\ntions so that the amplitude of the solutions is still small when it takes place. Thus\nwe will be concerned with the bifurcation diagram in the vicinity of the curve \u03ba4(d).\nThe bifurcation of the asymmetric solution from the normal solution has been\nwidely studied. Saint-James and De Gennes [20] examined the bifurcation in a half-\nspace and discovered that the bifurcation of asymmetric solutions occurs at a higher\nfield than that of symmetric solutions in an infinite slab. They also established that\nthe bifurcation switches from being supercritical to subcritical for \u03ba \n 0.4. Since then,\nthere has been a lot of rigorous work on the topic, including that of Bolley and Helffer\n[5], [6], [7], [8], [9] (computation of the field where the bifurcation happens and nature\nof the bifurcation in various limiting cases, namely \u03bad small and large, and d small\nand large) and Hastings and Troy [17] (existence of only asymmetric solutions for a\ncertain range of magnetic field). While this work was in progress, Dancer and Hastings\n[13] studied the global bifurcation diagrams and proved in particular that when \u03bad is\nlarge, there exists a branch of asymmetric solutions connecting the symmetric curve\nto the normal solution.\nASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS OF A SECONDARY BIFURCATION 1161\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n\u03ba\nd\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n5\n4\n1\nFig. 5.

Then in section 3, we study the response diagram in\nthe vicinity of the quintuple point. Finally, in section 4, we present our conclusions.\n2. Asymptotic analysis. Since the size of the domain d is a parameter which\nwe will want to vary, we begin by rescaling distance with d so that the domain will\nremain fixed as \u22121 < x < 1.

Close to the bifurcation point \u03a8 will be small. We quantify this smallness by\nintroducing a small parameter \u03b5 and setting\n\u03a8 = \u03b51\/2f,(2.5)\nA = Hd(x+ e) + \u03b5q,(2.6)\nas in [4], [10], [11], [19]. Here the relative scaling of f and q is motivated by the fact\nthat we want the nonlinear term \u03a83 to balance with the correction to \u03a8A2 in (2.1).\nFor ease of notation we set\np =\n1\n\u03ba2d2\n, h = Hd.\n1162 A.

Then f0 = C\u03b80, where C is undetermined at present. Now, the\nhomogeneous version of (2.16) with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions is\nsatisfied by a constant, so that by the Fredholm alternative there is a solvability\ncondition that the integral of the right-hand side is zero. Thus\u222b 1\n\u22121\n\u03b820(x+ e0) dx = 0.(2.17)\nThis is the equation which determines e0 (remember that \u03b80 is a function of e0). It is\neasy to see that e0 = 0 is always a solution since, in this case, \u03b80 will be even. This is\nthe symmetric superconducting solution. However, for some values of p and d (which\nwe will determine later) there is also a nonzero solution for e0. Note that if (\u03b80(x), e0)\nis a solution of (2.15) and (2.17), then (\u03b80(\u2212x),\u2212e0) is also a solution. These two\nsolutions are the asymmetric superconducting solutions.\nWe are interested in the secondary bifurcation in which the two asymmetric solu-\ntions and the symmetric solution reconnect to become a single symmetric solution. In\nparticular, we will be concerned with the situation in which the secondary bifurcation\nis close to the primary bifurcations, so that the amplitude of the solutions is still small\nwhen it takes place (the square in Figures 2 and 3 is close to \u03a8 = 0). In this case we\nexpect that e will be zero for all three solutions to leading order, but will be nonzero\nfor the asymmetric solutions at a higher order. Therefore, we expand in powers of \u03b5\nas\nf = f0 + \u03b5\n1\/2f1 + \u03b5f2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(2.18)\nq = q0 + \u03b5\n1\/2q1 + \u03b5q2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(2.19)\ne = \u03b51\/2e1 + \u03b5e2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(2.20)\nh = h0 + \u03b5h2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(2.21)\np = p0 + \u03b5p2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(2.22)\nd = d0 + \u03b5d2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .(2.23)\nASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS OF A SECONDARY BIFURCATION 1163\nThe motivation for the \u03b51\/2 scaling on e here is difficult to give. It occurs because the\nsolvability conditions on q at first and second order are satisfied automatically, leaving\ne1 to be determined by the third-order solvability condition as we will see. Once e\nhas assumed to be of order \u03b51\/2 the expansion for f and q must be in powers of \u03b51\/2.\nHowever, we still expand h in powers of \u03b5 since we know that this is the correct scaling\nfor the symmetric solution. Finally note that we also expand p and d to allow us to\nconsider what happens for (d, p) close to a point (d0, p0) on the curve \u03ba4. Again, the\nO(\u03b51\/2) term in these expansions is zero, so that the corrections to p0 and d0 come\ninto the solvability condition at the right order. The final justification for the form of\nthe expansions (2.18)\u2013(2.23) is the ability to develop them self-consistently.\nLeading order. Substituting the expansions (2.18)\u2013(2.23) into (2.7)\u2013(2.8) and\nequating coefficients of powers of \u03b5 we find that at leading order\nLf0 \u2261 p0f \u2032\u20320 + f0 \u2212 f0h20x2 = 0,(2.24)\nq\u2032\u20320 = d\n2\n0f\n2\n0h0x,(2.25)\nwith homogeneous Neumann boundary data. Let h0 be the leading eigenvalue of\n(2.24)2, and \u03b80 the corresponding normalized eigenfunction (with the L\n\u221e norm, say).\nThen f0 = C\u03b80, where C is undetermined at present. We see that q0 = C\n2a0, where\na\u2032\u20320 = d\n2\n0\u03b8\n2\n0h0x,(2.26)\nwith homogeneous Neumann boundary data. Thus q0 is determined once C is known.\nNote that \u03b80 is even, while a0 is odd, so that the solvability condition on (2.26) is\nautomatically satisfied.\nFirst order. At first order in (2.7) and (2.8) we find\nLf1 = 2f0h\n2\n0xe1,(2.27)\nq\u2032\u20321 = 2d\n2\n0f0f1h0x+ d\n2\n0f\n2\n0h0e1,(2.28)\nwith homogeneous Neumann boundary data. Since the operator L is self-adjoint\nand f0 satisfies the homogeneous version of (2.27), there is a solvability condition for\nf1 by the Fredholm alternative, which is that the right-hand side of (2.27) must be\northogonal to f0. However, this condition is automatically satisfied since f0 is even\nand the right-hand side of (2.27) is odd. Hence\nf1 = Ce1\u03b81 +D\u03b80,(2.29)\nwhere\nL\u03b81 = 2h\n2\n0x\u03b80.(2.30)\nSince L\u03b80 = 0 we may add any multiple of \u03b80 to \u03b81. However, it is convenient to fix\n\u03b81(0) = 0 so that \u03b81 is odd. We see that\nq1 = C\n2e1a1 + 2CDa0,(2.31)\nwhere\na\u2032\u20321 = 2d\n2\n0\u03b80\u03b81h0x+ d\n2\n0h0\u03b8\n2\n0.(2.32)\n2We choose to examine the leading eigenfunction, since it is shown in [10], [11] that this is the\none which has the possibility of being stable. Of course, a similar analysis can be performed using\nany eigenfunction.\n1164 A. AFTALION AND S. J. CHAPMAN\n1.5 2 2.5\n-1\n-0.75\n-0.5\n-0.25\n0.25\n0.5\np0\nFig. 6. The left-hand side of (2.33) as a function of p0.\nNow the homogeneous version of (2.32) is satisfied by a constant. Thus there is a\nsolvability condition on a1, which is\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n(\n2\u03b80\u03b81x+ \u03b8\n2\n0\n)\ndx = 0.(2.33)\nThis condition defines the curve \u03ba4. Note that since \u03b80 and \u03b81 are functions of p0\nonly, that is, they are independent of d0, condition (2.33) gives the curve \u03ba4 as p =\nconstant \u2248 1.218. The left-hand side of (2.33) is shown as a function of p0 in Figure\n6, from which it appears that there is a unique p0 satisfying (2.33). We believe this\nto be true, but note that it is not necessary for the following analysis, for which p0\nmay be any solution of (2.33).\nWith this solvability condition satisfied we may add any constant to a1. For\ndefiniteness we fix a1(0) = 0. Note that a1 is even.\nSecond order. Proceeding to the next order in the expansion in (2.7) we find\nLf2 = \u2212p2f \u2032\u20320 + f30 + 2h0h2x2f0 + 2h0xq0f0 + f0h20(e21 + 2xe2) + 2xe1f1h20,(2.34)\nq\u2032\u20322 = 2d0d2f\n2\n0h0x+ 2d\n2\n0f0f2h0x+ d\n2\n0f\n2\n1h0x+ d\n2\n0f\n2\n0h2x(2.35)\n+ d20f\n2\n0 q0 + d\n2\n0f\n2\n0h0e2 + 2d\n2\n0f0f1h0e1.\nAs before, since f0 satisfies the homogeneous version of (2.34) there is a solvability\ncondition which is derived by multiplying by f0 and integrating.

Figure 7 shows \u03b10 as a function\nof d0 on the curve \u03ba4.\nThe leading order solution is now determined. However, we need to proceed\nfurther down the expansions to determine the coefficients e1 and D of the first-order\nsolution, in order to distinguish between the symmetric and asymmetric branches.\nWe have\nf2 = C\n3\u03b82 + Cp2\u03c62 + Ce\n2\n1\u21262 + (Ce2 +De1)\u03b81 + E\u03b80,(2.39)\nwhere\nL\u03b82 = \u03b8\n3\n0 + 2h0\u03b10x\n2\u03b80 + 2h0xa0\u03b80,(2.40)\nL\u03c62 = \u2212\u03b8\u2032\u20320 + 2h0H2x2\u03b80,(2.41)\nL\u21262 = h\n2\n0\u03b80 + 2xh\n2\n0\u03b81.(2.42)\nAgain, we can add any multiple of \u03b80 to \u03b82, \u03c62, and \u21262.

Multiplying (2.48) by f0 and integrating,\nusing the expressions for f1, etc., we find after some manipulation that the only term\nremaining is that which is multiplied by C3D.

Hence \u03ba1 corresponds to\n\u03bb2d2 + \u00b52p2 = 0.(3.69)\nASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS OF A SECONDARY BIFURCATION 1169\nThe final curve \u03ba5 determines whether the asymmetric bifurcation is sub or super-\ncritical.

Thus\nwe see that \u03ba5 is given by\n\u03bb2d2 + p2\n(\n\u00b52 \u2212 \u03b11\u03b42\n\u03b31\n\u2212 \u03b21\u03b72\n\u03b31\n+\n2\u03b11\u03b21\u03bd2\n\u03b321\n)\n= 0,(3.72)\nwith the constraint that p2 < 0. Thus we have been able to determine the lines\nin the p2d2-plane (two infinite, one semi-infinite) across which the behavior of the\nbifurcation diagram changes.\nThese may be translated to the \u03bad-plane by noting that\np2 = \u22122(d2\u03ba0 + d0\u03ba2)\nd30\u03ba\n3\n0\n.\nIn Figures 9 and 10 we show the curves \u03ba1, \u03ba4, and \u03ba5 in the pd- and \u03bad-planes,\nrespectively. In Figures 11\u201316 we show a selection of bifurcation diagrams. Figures\n11 and 12 correspond to regions where no asymmetric solutions exist and the curve\nis a curve of symmetric solutions. In Figures 13 to 16 the asymmetric branch is the\none that bifurcates from the normal solution at the higher field.\nNote that the bifurcation point for the symmetric solution is h4 = \u03b32, while that\nfor the asymmetric solution is\nh4 = \u03b32 + p\n2\n2\n(\n\u03b21\u03bd2\n\u03b321\n\u2212 \u03b21\u03b42\n\u03b31\n)\n\u2248 \u03b32 + 0.577p22.\nThe coefficient of p22 here is positive, so that the asymmetric solution always bifurcates\nat a higher value of h in the vicinity of the quintuple point (in fact numerical simu-\nlations indicate that this is always true).\nNote also that we may calculate the angle between the two solutions at the sec-\nondary bifurcation point.

We have examined the bifurcation from the normal solution of\nsuperconducting solutions of the Ginzburg\u2013Landau equations on a slab (GLd), us-\ning the applied magnetic field as the bifurcation parameter. There are bifurcation\nbranches corresponding to both symmetric and asymmetric solutions, and their exis-\ntence and behavior depends on the additional parameters d, the slab thickness, and\n\u03ba, the Ginzburg\u2013Landau parameter.\nIt was found numerically in [3] that there are three distinct regions of the \u03bad-\nplane, A0, A1, and A2, in which there are, respectively, no asymmetric solutions, at\nmost one, and at most two asymmetric solutions.\nHere we have been concerned with the curve they labeled \u03ba4(d), which divides\nA0 from A1 \u222a A2. This is the curve across which the asymmetric solution ceases to\nexist and is given by (2.33). We find it is of the form \u03bad = C, where C is constant\nand approximately equal to 0.90.\nClose to \u03ba4 the secondary bifurcation in which the asymmetric solutions connect\nwith the symmetric solution to form a single symmetric solution lies close to the\nnormal solution, i.e., close to the primary bifurcations. Thus, close to \u03ba4, we have\nbeen able to see the secondary bifurcation explicitly through our asymptotic analysis.\nSince the leading-order problem corresponds to a linearization about the normal\nstate, the amplitude of the leading-order solution is not determined at leading order\nbut by a solvability condition at higher order. We found that along most of the curve\n\u03ba4 this solvability condition occurs at second order and leads to the perturbation of\nthe magnetic field from the bifurcation value being quadratic in the amplitude of the\nleading-order solution as given by (2.36). The symmetric and asymmetric solutions\nare the same to leading order, and we were able to distinguish between them at first\norder and identify the secondary bifurcation point.\nHowever, at one point on \u03ba4, (called the quintuple point and given by \u03b10 = 0,\nwhere \u03b10 is defined by (2.37)) the primary bifurcations switch from being subcritical\nto supercritical, and at this point the amplitude of the solutions is determined by a\nsolvability condition at fourth order, with the perturbation of the magnetic field from\nthe bifurcation value being quartic in the amplitude of the leading-order solution, as\ngiven by (3.59). In this case the symmetric and asymmetric solutions have different\namplitudes at leading order. This is the point at which A0, A1, and A2 meet, and there\nare five different qualitative behaviours for the bifurcation diagram in the vicinity of\nthis point. This rich structure is captured completely by our asymptotic analysis. In\nparticular, we are able to establish that the asymmetric branch lies to the left of the\nsymmetric branch close to the secondary bifurcation point, but to the right of it near\nthe primary bifurcation points (near the normal solution), so that the two branches\nmust always cross at some point. We have also determined the condition for there to\nbe a nose in the asymmetric branch.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
