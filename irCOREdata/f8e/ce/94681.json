Past offenders can be\npunished, while future potential offenders may be deterred by the prospect of\npunishment. Yet, justice is no substitute for intervention for the benefit of people at\nacute risk of being victimized. The Court may create a new moral hazard problem if\nthe promise of ex post justice makes it easier for states to shy away from incurring the\ncosts of intervention. This article indirectly tests for the relevance of this potential\nproblem by estimating the determinants of ratification delay to the Rome Statute of\nthe ICC. I find that countries, which in the past have been more willing to intervene in\nforeign civil wars and more willing to contribute troops to multinational peacekeeping\nmissions are more likely to have ratified the Statute (early on). This suggests that the\nCourt is a complement to, not a substitute for intervention.\n1. Introduction\nThe creation of an International Criminal Court (ICC) has been hailed by many as a\nmajor breakthrough in international law. Weller (2002: 693), for example, has called\nit \u2018the culmination of international law-making of the twentieth century\u2019. Former\nUnited Nations (UN) General Secretary Kofi Annan regards it as \u2018a vital part of an\nemerging system of international human rights protection\u2019 (Annan 1997\/98: 365).\nYet, the ICC is no substitute for humanitarian intervention and multinational\npeacekeeping since at best it provides ex post justice together with the hope of\ndeterrence of future crimes, but no immediate relief and assistance to people at risk of\nbecoming the victims of grave offences. Critics have argued that the ICC might just\nbe a cheap way for states, which are unwilling or unable to intervene militarily abroad\n3and to contribute to peacekeeping, to demonstrate to their domestic publics seeming\naction against genocide, war crimes, aggression and crimes against humanity (Smith\n2002). In other words, is the ICC a form of organized hypocrisy behind which states\nhide who cannot or do not want to take real action?\nThis article attempts to answer this question indirectly by examining ratification\nof the Rome Statute of the ICC. Specifically, we test whether countries that have been\nmore willing in the past to intervene militarily in conflicts abroad and who have\ncontributed more often troops to multinational peacekeeping are more or less likely to\nhave ratified the Rome Statute (early on). An answer to this question not only sheds\nlight on the likely motivations of state parties, it also informs a judgement of the\nlikely future effectiveness of the Court. The ICC is only as strong as its enforcement\ncapacity and it is dependent on states for crucial assistance during all stages of its\nproceedings, particularly for the capture and extradition of indicted individuals. If\nthose states that are willing to commit troops for military intervention and\npeacekeeping abroad were less likely to support the ICC, then this would bode badly\nfor the Court\u2019s enforcement capacity.\nIn brief, the results from a stratified proportional hazard model over the period\n1998 to 2005 suggest that, despite the notable opposition to the Court from the United\nStates, Russia, India, China and others, states that have been more willing to intervene\nabroad and more willing to contribute to multinational peacekeeping in the past have\nbeen more, not less, likely to ratify the Rome Statute (early on). Taking ratification as\nan indication of revealed preference for ICC support, this suggests that the Court is\nunlikely to function as a sorry excuse for inactive governments.\n42. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court\nThe idea for an ICC equivalent was briefly floated in the post-Second World War era,\nbut soon dumped in the wake of Cold War antagonism. It was reinvigorated by\nTrinidad and Tobago in the late 1980s with the support of other Caribbean countries,\nwhich wanted to see international drug trafficking and money laundering being\nprosecuted by an international court. The International Law Commission, a UN expert\nbody of legal scholars, was charged with formulating a draft statute, a final version of\nwhich was presented to the UN General Assembly in 1994 (Schabas 2004).\nEncouraged by the establishment of the two ad hoc tribunals for Yugoslavia and\nRwanda, the General Assembly created a preparatory committee whose objective was\nto formulate a draft treaty with much wider coverage and competence for a permanent\ncourt to be established than initially envisioned by Trinidad and Tobago or the\nInternational Law Commission.\nAt a conference in the Italian capital, the Rome Statute of the ICC was opened\nfor signature in July 1998 after five weeks of negotiation. International civil society,\nin the form of the NGO Coalition for an International Criminal Court (CICC), exerted\nan important influence on the negotiations of the Rome Statute, but only after the\ndecision to establish an ICC in principle had already been taken by states (Fehl 2004:\n374). The Rome Statute entered into force on 1 July 2002 after having been ratified by\n60 state parties. As of July 2007, the treaty had been ratified by 105 states. The four\nmost prominent non-parties are the United States, Russia, India and China.\nAfter long negotiations, the state delegates present in Rome decided to include\nfour categories of crimes under the remit of the ICC (Art. 5:1): genocide, crimes\nagainst humanity, war crimes and, at least in principle, aggression. These crimes are\nconsidered so heinous that their punishment should be a matter of international\n5concern and jurisdiction. The list of crimes can be added to at a review conference, to\nbe held seven years after the coming into force of the Rome Statute, i.e. in 2009.\nCurrently, it seems that state parties have little appetite for amending the list of\ncrimes. In fact, it is even doubtful whether they will give full effect to the aggression\ncategory. This crime was formally included in the Statute, but essentially to no effect\nsince the negotiators at the Rome Conference could not agree on a definition of what\nconstitutes aggression and how it is to be prosecuted, leaving these essential details to\nfuture amendments instead (Art. 5:2).\nAccording to Art. 6, genocide covers \u2018acts committed with intent to destroy, in\nwhole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\u2019. Of note, much like the\n1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the\nRome Statute does not cover political and social groups within the scope of genocide,\nwhich according to Schabas (2004: 40) has been frequently criticized. Art. 7 of the\nStatute lists 11 acts of crimes against humanity, from the somewhat anachronistic\ncrime of apartheid to the widely recognized crimes of murder, torture and enforced\ndisappearance as well as \u2018rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced\npregnancy, enforced sterilization\u2019, only very recently recognized as crimes against\nhumanity. Prosecution of such acts is always subject to the requirement that they are\n\u2018committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian\npopulation, with knowledge of the attack\u2019 (Art. 7:1). Art. 8 of the Statute represents\nperhaps one of the greatest steps forward. Very explicitly, it extends the scope of war\ncrimes from international conflicts to civil wars (Schabas 2004: 54). It covers \u2018grave\nbreaches of the Geneva Conventions\u2019 together with \u2018other serious violations of the\nlaws and customs applicable in international armed conflict\u2019, but also \u2018serious\nviolations of article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions\u2019 as well as \u2018other\n6serious violations of the laws and customs\u2019 for civil wars. However, state parties can\nopt out of the provisions for war crimes for a one-off transitory period of seven years\n(Art. 124).\nThe Court can exercise jurisdiction over individuals whether or not their nation-\nstate is party to the ICC as long as the crime has been committed within the territory\nof state parties. However, the Court requires the consent of either the state of the\naccused national or the state, in which the crime took place, unless the case is referred\nto the Court by the UN Security Council. Also, the Court is only meant to take action\nunder the principle of complementarity, i.e. only when a state \u2018is unwilling or unable\ngenuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution\u2019 (Art. 17). Commanders can be\nprosecuted for crimes committed by forces under his or her command if the\ncommander knew about the crimes and could have prevented them (Art. 28).\nConversely, offenders cannot take recourse to the argument that they committed\ncrimes upon superior orders (Art. 33). No offence can be prosecuted that took place\nbefore the Rome State came into effect in July 2002 (Art. 11).\n3. A potential moral hazard problem: the ICC as an excuse for inaction?\nMost extant scholarship has focused on trying to make sense of US resistance toward\nthe ICC and has discussed at length the credibility and merits of the two main US\nobjections toward the Court \u2013 see, for example, Forsythe (2002), Mayerfeld (2003),\nFehl (2004), Schabas (2004), Weller (2004), Ralph (2005) and Johansen (2006). The\ntwo main explicitly stated objections are the potential for abuse of the Court by enemy\nstates and the risk to US military personnel on active duty abroad (Bolton 2002).\nClearly, the Rome Statute could have been constructed in a way that would have\nmade it easy for the US to ratify. In particular, it could have allowed permanent\n7members of the UN Security Council to veto any investigation and prosecution, thus\neffectively enabling them to protect any of their nationals or those of their allies.\nDoing so would have meant creating large \u201cloopholes\u201d in exchange for the benefit of\nsupport by the US.\nThis proved unacceptable to the vast majority of negotiating states, however.\nInstead, the parties chose an option that risked US withdrawal from the entire project.\nThe UN Security Council can defer investigations and prosecutions repeatedly for a\nperiod of twelve months each (Art. 16), but none of its permanent members has the\npower to veto the initiation of such proceedings in the first place. As a result, the Bush\nadministration withdrew Clinton\u2019s signature under the Rome Statute and it began to\nactively undermine the ICC by, first, refusing to support UN peacekeeping missions\nunless US citizens are explicitly exempted from ICC proceedings and, second,\npressurizing state parties via the threat of economic and political sanctions into\nconcluding immunity agreements guaranteeing that no US citizens will be held or\nextradited for the purpose of ICC proceedings (Johansen 2006). However, the Bush\nadministration has recently wavered a bit in its resolution to refuse co-operation with\nthe ICC. In particular, it has abstained from vetoing a UN Security Council vote\nreferring the Darfurian crisis in Sudan to investigation by the ICC in March 2005\n(Grono 2006: 629).\nThe decision by the state parties to solve the crucial issue of the role and power\nof permanent UN Security Council members in the particular way described above\nhas prompted critics to question the enforcement capacity of the ICC. Fehl (2004:\n358), for example, wonders \u2018\u2026why was the new institution designed in such a way\nthat it failed to gain the support of the one country which is, by all accounts, most\nimportant for enforcing its future decisions?\u2019. This is a relevant question to ask, after\n8all the US is in a unique position due to its quasi-universal deployment of troops and\ninfrastructure and its logistical and military capacity to intervene virtually anywhere\nin the world.\nYet, this critique only scratches the surface of a potential problem that reaches\nmuch further than the enforcement of future Court decisions. The very creation of the\nICC might present a fundamental problem, namely via the negative effect it\npotentially has on humanitarian intervention and multinational peacekeeping. There\nare two reasons why the ICC might have such a negative effect. One argues with a\ndirect deterrence effect, the other one with a potential moral hazard problem. The\nformer is a favourite argument of the US administration used in its opposition to the\nCourt. Let us briefly discuss each argument in turn.\nThe ICC may directly deter humanitarian intervention and peacekeeping if\nthose who intervene and contribute to peacekeeping must fear that their military\npersonnel may face future indictment for their actions by the ICC. As David Scheffer,\nthen US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues has put it in addressing the UN\nGeneral Assembly in 1998: \u2018The Rome treaty will become the single most effective\nbrake on international and regional peacekeeping in the 21st century.\u2019 (cited in\nSchmitt and Richards 2000). Similarly, US Major Michael L. Smidt (2001: 240)\ncontends that \u2018the court will likely make the world a much more dangerous place\nbecause it will likely deter the forces of good, which will allow the forces of evil to\nact with impunity\u2019. India, another prominent critic of the ICC and, contrary to the US,\na troop contributor to many multinational peacekeeping missions, has similarly raised\nthe issue of a negative effect of the ICC on peacekeeping operations and concern for\nits army personnel involved in such operations as part of its case against ICC\nratification (Koshy 2004: 2439; McDoldrick 2004: 440).\n9Such arguments are rather implausible, however. It is possible, of course, that\nmembers of an intervening or peacekeeping force will commit crimes that fall under\nthe auspices of the ICC and might be indicted for them. But judged from past\nexperience, committing such crimes during interventions or peacekeeping missions is\nthe rare exception, not the rule, and would constitute cases that should be prosecuted\nby the state to which these soldiers belong to itself, such that the ICC would never\nbecome active in the first place. Neither is it likely that the ICC would become\npoliticised to enact dubious prosecutions against intervening forces. That the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) quickly dismissed\ncharges against North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries provides a case\nin point. Rather, what the US seems to be concerned about is that the Court might\nbecome active in the case of military interventions for which the humanitarian\njustification is very dubious, like the invasions of Grenada and Panama in 1983 and\n1989, respectively. Even then, however, it is difficult to see how the Court would\nbecome active in the absence of a detailed provision for crimes of aggression.\nThe moral hazard problem is more pertinent and a priori more plausible. As\nSmith (2002: 177) has formulated it succinctly: \u2018If international actors feel confident\nthat human rights criminals will eventually be brought to justice, either in their own\ncountries or before the ICC, they may be less inclined to intervene to stop human\nrights crimes while they are happening, something international actors have been\nreluctant to do in any case.\u2019 As a consequence, \u2018the ICC may become a virtuous\nexcuse for states to turn a blind eye to atrocities, a moral free ride on the coattails of\nhumanitarian law\u2019 (Smith 2002: 178).\nSuch suspicion and criticism is fuelled by the reaction of the international\ncommunity to the crimes committed during the Yugoslav wars and the Rwandan\n10\ngenocide. In both cases, states arguably failed to intervene or intervened far too late.\nIn both cases, states tried to make up for their failure by installing special ad hoc\ntribunals to prosecute crimes ex post. Aryeh Neier (1998: 112), co-founder and then\ndirector of Human Rights Watch, argues that the Yugoslav tribunal acted as a\nsubstitute for action: \u2018Facing domestic criticism for allowing the slaughter to continue\nunchecked, some governments seemed to feel obliged to show that they were doing\nsomething\u2019, and without much actual political cost. Similarly, Forsythe (1994: 403)\nhas commented that European states \u2018felt the need to give the appearance of doing\nsomething about violations of humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia\u2019, but\n\u2018lacking the political will to act decisively to curtail abuses of prisoners and civilians,\nthey endorsed or went along with the creation of the Tribunal\u2019. Is something similar\nhappening with the ICC?\n4. An Indirect Test for the Moral Hazard Problem\nThe potential moral hazard problem created by the ICC cannot be directly observed or\ntested for. As an indirect test, we estimate the determinants of its ratification. The idea\nis that if the ICC creates an excuse for states which are reluctant to act, then these\nstates should be the prime supporters of the Court, which should reveal itself via\n(early) ratification. In other words, if the ICC represented a real moral hazard\nproblem, then states which have been relatively inactive in the past as interveners in\nforeign humanitarian crises should be the prime supporters of the ICC. If these states\nwere the prime supporters of the ICC then this would suggest that the court functions\nas a substitute for action (the moral hazard problem is very relevant). If the opposite\nwere the case \u2013 that is, if states which have been more active in the past were its\n11\nprime supporters \u2013 then this would suggest that the ICC functions as a complement to\naction, which would imply that the moral hazard problem is rather irrelevant.\nFor this argument to be valid, it must not be the case that countries which have\nbeen active in the past ratify (early on) precisely because they are anxious to get the\nICC established such that they have an excuse for being less active in the future. I\ncontend that this is a safe presumption to make for either one of two reasons. First, if\npreferences for intervention in foreign humanitarian crises are allowed to differ across\ncountries, then those countries which have been more active in the past may have a\nstronger taste for intervention than less active countries and since preferences have\nnot changed will keep having this stronger taste. Second, if preferences for\nintervention are assumed to be equal across countries, then the side constraints they\nface will still differ. If domestic public pressure has managed to induce certain\ncountries to be more active in the past than others even in the absence of an ICC, then\nit is likely that this same domestic public will manage to impose enough pressure on\nits government to remain active in the future as well even after the ICC has been\nestablished since the domestic pressure groups certainly regard the ICC as a\ncomplement to action, not as a substitute.1 It is the countries, which have managed to\nwithstand pressure for action in the past that are likely to be tempted by the potential\nmoral hazard created by the ICC. For these countries, the establishment of an ICC\ncould potentially represent a means to deflect criticism toward its inaction, thus\nenabling them to remain inactive in the future.\nThis is not to say that the establishment of the ICC could not represent a moral\nhazard in a specific case even for a country, which has been a rather active intervener\n1 See, for example, the NGO \u201cCoalition for an International Criminal Court\u201d website at\nhttp:\/\/www.iccnow.org\/.\n12\nin the past. Even a generally active country may use the existence of the ICC as a\nmeans to deflect criticism toward its inaction due to the particular contextual\ncircumstances of the specific case at hand (for example, because the country is on\nfriendly terms with the offending government). However, one would expect that other\nmore active countries would be willing to step in, unless intervention similarly goes\nagainst their interests. What this means, in sum, is the following: If states which have\nbeen relatively inactive in the past are the prime supporters of the ICC, then this\nwould suggest that the moral hazard is very relevant, whereas the moral hazard is less\nrelevant if it is mainly supported by countries that have been rather active in the past.\nBut even then, the moral hazard still exists and may, depending on the circumstances\nof the specific case, represent more or less of a problem.\nA final critical hurdle for the indirect test of the moral hazard problem to work\nis the presumption that countries are generally under pressure to act in foreign\nhumanitarian crises. If there is no such pressure, then there is no need to deflect\ncriticism for inaction and the ICC cannot exert any moral hazard for countries\nunwilling to act. The liberal democracies of developed countries of the world are\nmore likely to experience such pressure domestically than developing countries due to\ntheir stronger civil society and due to their commitment to human rights protection\n(Andersson 2002; Lebovic 2004). However, even developing countries can be under\npressure from the outside. Several observers have attributed the increasing role of\ndeveloping countries in post-Cold War peacekeeping missions to pressure from\ndeveloped countries (see, for example, Byman and Waxman 2002; Pugh 2004;\nNeethling 2004). The main result of this article\u2019s analysis upholds if the sample is\nrestricted to developed countries only. It is thus robust to excluding developing\n13\ncountries from the sample, for which the moral hazard problem may be less of an\nissue in the first place.\n5. Research Design\nAs mentioned already, our indirect test of the moral hazard problem works via\nestimating the determinants of ratification of the Rome Statute. To be precise, I\nestimate the determinants of ratification delay with an event type model. Such a\nmodel uses more information than a pure cross-sectional probit or logit model with a\nsimple ratification dummy as dependent variable. The extra information used is the\ntime delay between the opening of the Rome Statute for signature and ratification\nuntil eventual ratification, for those countries that have ratified. The event type model\nthus not only distinguishes between ratifiers and non-ratifiers, but it further\ndistinguishes among the ratifying countries between early and late ratifiers, assuming\nthat early ratification reveals stronger support for the ICC than late ratification. This\ncan be justified on two accounts: First, early ratification increases the probability that\nan international treaty will come into force as typically a minimum threshold of\nratifications needs to be exceeded (60 in the case of the Rome Statute). Second, the\nmore countries ratify early on, the more credibility the treaty gains and the higher the\npressure on remaining states to ratify the treaty as well. Strong supporters of a treaty\nshould thus not merely ratify a treaty, but will be keen to ratify early on.\nData on the year of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession of the Rome\nStatute is taken from United Nations (2007). The country year rather than country day\nforms the basis of our sample since the control variables are only available on an\nannual basis. Smith (2004) argues that there are distinct regional norms of state\nparticipation in the ICC following from preference heterogeneity across regions. To\n14\naccount for this possibility, we use a stratified Cox proportional hazard model, where\nwe stratify by regions following largely World Bank country classification.2 This\nallows each region to have its own baseline hazard. Formally, the dependent variable\nis the conditional probability \u03c1(t) that ratification occurs at time t given that the\ncountry has not ratified before t; this is the hazard of ratification:\n\u03c1i(t) =\u03c10i(t)exp(\uf062Tx(t)), (1)\nwhere i stands for the ith stratum (region), \u03c10i(t) is the \u201cbaseline hazard\u201d,\ndiffering between regions (but uniform within a region), and \uf062T is the vector of\nparameters to be estimated. The time-variant underlying baseline hazard of\nratification may depend on unobserved variables, possibly in complex ways. An\nadvantage of the Cox model is that the baseline hazard does not need to be estimated.\nThe likelihood function is constructed using the observation that the probability that\ncountry i ratifies at time ti equals\n\uf0e5\uf0e5\n\uf0b3\uf0b3\n\uf03d\uf03d\nijij ttj\nii\nT\nii\nT\nttj\nij\nii\nii t\nt\nt\nt\nt\n||\n))(exp(\n))(exp(\n)(\n)(\n)(\u02c6\nx\u03b2\nx\u03b2\n\uf072\n\uf072\uf072 . (2)\nThe likelihood function to be maximized with respect to the vector \uf062T then\nequals\uf0d5\nit ii\nt )(\u02c6\uf072 .\nThe two central explanatory variables are military intervention abroad and\ncontributions to peacekeeping. I use the Uppsala\/PRIO dataset as source for the\nvariable measuring intervention in foreign civil conflicts (Gleditsch et al. 2002). The\nspecific measure used is the sum of country years in which a country intervened in a\nforeign civil conflict since 1990, weighted by conflict intensity. The decision to use\n2 The difference is that Canada and the US form one region together with Central America and the\nCaribbean and South American countries constitute their own region.\n15\n1990 as a cut-off point is to account for the fact that the world fundamentally changed\nafter the end of the Cold War. The measure is weighted by conflict-intensity since it\ntakes much more courage and commitment to intervene in more intense foreign\nconflicts. No attempt was made to distinguish \u201chumanitarian\u201d intervention from \u201cself-\ninterested\u201d interventions since there is no objective way of doing so. Data on\ncontributions to peacekeeping are taken from a database of the Stockholm\nInternational Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), available at\nhttp:\/\/conflict.sipri.org\/SIPRI_Internet\/. The specific measure used is the sum of\ncountry years in which a country contributed troops to a multinational peacekeeping\noperation abroad since 1990, whether led by the UN, by a regional inter-governmental\norganization or by an ad hoc group of states.\nThere are six control variables. Democracy is measured by Polity data and\naccounts for the fact that democracies are much more likely to ratify international\nhuman rights treaties (Landman 2005). Per capita income accounts for the possibility\nthat demand for the ICC may be a normal good, using data from World Bank (2006).\nThe remaining control variables are meant to capture the expected future potential\ncosts of ratification to the ratifying state, its leaders and citizens. Note that since no\noffences prior to the entry into force of the Rome Statute can be prosecuted and the\nCourt will exert its major impact only in years to come, the variables we use\napproximate the future costs of ratification by looking at potentially offensive\nbehaviour in the past. This will be a good proxy for expected future costs of\nratification only if one is willing to make the assumption that states which have\nengaged in potential offences in the past (or rather their political leaders) have a taste\nfor and are therefore likely to commit such potential offences in the future.\n16\nTo start with, we include a variable measuring the sum of country years since\n1990, in which a genocide or politicide has taken place in a country, weighted by the\nintensity of the crime, with data taken from Harff (2006).3 Despite the fact that the\nRome Statute covers only genocides explicitly, not politicides, we do not exclude\npoliticides from this measure since they are likely to fall under the category of crimes\nagainst humanity. Empirically, it makes little difference to our estimations if we\nexclude politicides.\nTo our knowledge, there is no data measuring war crimes. In its absence, we use\ndata on conflict involvement. Put simply, the argument is that nationals from a\ncountry that is involved in more and more intense armed conflicts are more likely to\nbe indicted for war crimes. The link may be weak, but we see no other way of\ncapturing this aspect. The specific variables we use are the sum of country years since\n1990, in which a country was involved in an international or civil armed conflict,\nweighted by conflict intensity, using again data from the Uppsala\/PRIO project. The\nlast control variable is the number of times a state has initiated an international armed\nconflict since 1990, using and slightly extending data from Gleditsch (2004). Whilst,\nas discussed above, aggression is not a fully specified crime under the auspices of the\nRome Statute yet, this may change in the future, which may deter states with a\npreference for initiating international conflicts from ratifying.\n3 Genocide and politicide are defined as events involving \u2018the promotion, execution, and\/or implied\nconsent of sustained policies by governing elites or their agents or in the case of civil war, either of the\ncontending authorities that result in the deaths of a substantial portion of a communal group or\npoliticized non-communal group. In genocides the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of\ntheir communal (ethnolinguistic, religious) characteristics. In politicides, by contrast, groups are\ndefined primarily in terms of their political opposition to the regime and dominant groups.\u2019\n17\n6. Results\nTable 1 presents the Cox regression results. To start with, the sample includes both\ndeveloped and developing countries. The military intervention and peacekeeping\nvariables have positive and statistically significant coefficients in columns I and II,\nrespectively, when entered separately to the control variables. They remain significant\nwhen entered together in column III. Countries that intervene more in foreign civil\nconflicts and contribute more to multinational peacekeeping abroad are therefore\nstatistically significantly more likely to have ratified the Rome Statute (early on).\n< Insert Table 1 around here >\nWith respect to the control variables, democracy is a clearly statistically\nsignificant positive determinant of ratification, but per capita income has no effect. A\nhistory of initiating wars deters countries from ratifying, as does involvement in\ninternational armed conflicts (the coefficient is marginally insignificant in column I).4\nExperience of civil war does not reduce the likelihood of a country ratifying. Neither\ndoes a history of genocide and politicide.\nIn columns IV to VI we repeat the set of estimations for a sample of only\ndeveloped countries (member countries of the Organisation of Economic Co-\noperation and Development or the European Union).5 As mentioned before, this is to\naccount for the fact that the pressure to become active may be far lower in developing\n4 Goodliffe et al. (2006) similarly find that the expected costs of ratification deter some countries from\nratifying.\n5 The genocide\/politicide history variable is dropped since no developed country experienced such an\nevent during the relevant time period.\n18\ncountries compared to developed countries, such that the moral hazard may be less\nrelevant in developing countries in the first place. Despite the substantial loss of\nobservations and therefore of efficiency of estimation, the results show that both the\nintervention in foreign civil conflicts and the contribution to multinational\npeacekeeping variables remain statistically significant if entered on their own. If\nentered together, the peacekeeping variable is still significant, whereas the\nintervention variable is not. This is likely to be due to the high correlation between the\ntwo variables (r = 0.62 in this sample). A chi-squared test rejects the hypothesis that\nboth variables are equal to zero at p > 0.0057.\n7. Conclusion\nThe ICC represents a milestone for the international human rights movement. For the\nfirst time in the history of humankind, there exists the general possibility of\nprosecuting political leaders as well as ordinary citizens who have committed crimes\nof genocide, war crimes as well as crimes against humanity before an international\ncourt with quasi-universal jurisdiction. The ICC currently investigates allegations in\nfour African countries \u2013 Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo,\nSudan and Uganda \u2013 and it has initiated its first trial against Congolese national\nThomas Lubanga Dyilo, indicted for war crimes.\nCritics have argued, however, that the establishment of the ICC may create a\nnew moral hazard. States reluctant to intervene militarily and to contribute to\nmultinational peacekeeping may use the existence of the ICC as an excuse for their\ninaction. It may allow states to reassure their domestic publics that something is done\nand that crimes can no longer be committed with impunity, without incurring the\nsubstantial costs for preventing those crimes in the first place. The vague promise of\n19\nex post justice would then be likely to replace immediate protection. The implication\nof this would be that the ICC on the whole could represent a step back rather than\nforward in the quest for protecting victims of genocide, war crimes and other crimes\nagainst humanity.\nThe existence and actual relevance of this possibility for a new moral hazard\nproblem is difficult to ascertain directly. This article has offered an indirect test.\nSpecifically, if the moral hazard argument applies, then those states which have been\nrather reluctant to intervene militarily and to contribute to multinational peacekeeping\nin the past should also be the prime supporters of the ICC and therefore be the first\nones to ratify its Rome Statute. However, we find the exact opposite. Those states that\nare willing to play an active role in interventions and peacekeeping are also, on\naverage, the prime supporters of the ICC. It would therefore appear that the ICC is not\na sorry excuse for inactive states, but another strategy for active states to combat\nsituations in which acts of genocide, war crimes as well as crimes against humanity\ncan happen and can be committed with impunity.\nYet, given the indirectness of our test for the moral hazard created by the ICC,\nonly the future will tell whether the ICC will complement or substitute action. The\ncurrent situation in Darfur, Sudan, does not provide a clear picture. On the one hand,\nseveral hundred thousand people have already reportedly been killed and while there\nis the will from several, mainly Western and African states to intervene in a\nmeaningful way, this has yet to happen. The case is under ICC investigation following\na referral by the UN Security Council, but it appears that this move was part of a\nstrategy to increase pressure on the Sudanese government to facilitate real protection\nof people at risk rather than a substitute for intervention.\n20\nAnother caveat is that there remains the possibility that the existence of the ICC\ncreates an incentive even for a state, which has been rather active in the past, not to\nintervene in a specific case if intervention goes against the state\u2019s interests. That is,\neven if in general the ICC does not represent a moral hazard, it can do so for specific\ncountries in specific cases. However, on the whole the fact that the ICC is primarily\nsupported by states, which have been active in the past, suggests that it will function\nas a complement to, not a substitute for action. If accompanied by action, the ICC can\nform an important step forward in the protection of victims. Our estimation results\npaint a cautiously optimistic picture in demonstrating that the ICC has been ratified\nearly on by states, which have been willing to act in the past. This bodes well for the\nICC and its future contributing role to the fight against heinous political crimes,\ndespite continued opposition to the Court from the US in particular, but many other\ncountries as well, including China and India.\n21\nReferences\nAndersson, A. 2002. \u2018United Nations intervention by united democracies?
