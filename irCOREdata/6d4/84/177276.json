To acclimate to such fluctuations, plants have evolved adaptive\nmechanisms that optimally exploit available light energy and simultaneously\nminimise damage of the photosynthetic apparatus through excess light. An\nimportant mechanism is the dissipation of excess excitation energy as heat\nwhich can be measured as nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluo-\nrescence (NPQ).

We investigate the stationary and dy-\nnamic behaviour of the model and systematically analyse the dependence of\ncharacteristic system properties on key parameters such as rate constants and\npool sizes. Comparing simulations with experimental data allows to derive\nconclusions about the validity of the simplifying assumptions and we fur-\nther propose hypotheses regarding the role of the xanthophyll cycle in NPQ.\nWe envisage that the presented theoretical description of the light reactions\nin conjunction with short term adaptive processes serves as a basis for the\ndevelopment of more detailed mechanistic models by which the molecular\nmechanisms of NPQ can be theoretically studied.\nEmail address: ebenhoeh@abdn.ac.uk (Oliver Ebenho\u00a8h)\nPreprint submitted to BioSystems May 25, 2011\nKeywords: photosynthesis, light reactions, nonphotochemical quenching of\nchlorophyll fluorescence, chlorophyll fluorescence, mathematical model\n1. Introduction\nIn oxygenic photosynthesis, plants harvest solar energy and transform it\ninto biochemically useful energy and redox equivalents in the form of ATP\nand NADPH, which are required to assimilate carbon and nitrogen, and to\ndrive other metabolic and cellular processes. Since under natural environ-\nmental conditions, light intensity may vary considerably in time, for example\nby clouds obscuring the sun, the photosynthetic machinery has to acclimate\nrapidly to these fluctuations to prevent excess excitation, which may severely\ndamage the photosynthetic apparatus. The evolved mechanisms to optimally\nexploit the available light energy while simultaneously minimising photo-\ndamage include the dissipation of excess excitation energy as heat. This\nprocess can be readily measured as nonphotochemical quenching of chloro-\nphyll fluorescence (NPQ) (for a review, see Horton et al., 2008). Three pro-\ncesses contribute to NPQ, termed energy dependent, state transition-related\nand photo-inhibitory quenching (qE, qT, and qI, respectively, see Quick and\nStitt 1989; Horton et al. 2008). Under high light conditions, qE presents the\nmajor component of NPQ. Several factors are believed to contribute to qE,\nthe interplay of which has not yet been fully elucidated. Energy dependent\n(qE) quenching is triggered by a high \u2206pH over the thylakoid membrane and\nis evidently linked to the xanthophyll cycle (Horton et al., 2008), in which\nzeaxanthin is formed by enzymatic de-epoxidation of violaxanthin. How ex-\nactly zeaxanthin triggers fluorescence quenching is not yet fully clarified,\nhowever, it is argued that zeaxanthin may act as a direct quencher (Frank\net al., 1994).\nExisting mathematical models of chlorophyll fluorescence considering the\nfast fluorescence induction kinetics on the timescale of microseconds (Zhu\net al., 2005; Vredenberg, 2009) are very useful to explore the mechanisms\nwithin photosystem II (PSII) which give rise to fluorescence signals. Other\nmodels are highly elaborate, encompassing detailed descriptions of the elec-\ntron transport processes in conjunction with the carbon fixating dark reac-\ntions of the Calvin cycle (Laisk et al., 1997, 2006). These approaches are\nhelpful to evaluate whether our general understanding of the entirety of the\nphotosynthetic processes is basically correct. In this paper, we concentrate\n2\non the particular process of NPQ. For this, we focus on time scales of sec-\nonds to minutes, in which the state of the reaction centres (RCs) can be ap-\nproximated as stationary. We follow the reductionist approach first applied\nto photosynthesis by Thornley (1974), and deliberately develop a minimal\nmodel which is capable of reproducing key biological properties. A minimal\nmodel allows for a systematic analysis of the importance of parameters on\nthe overall performance and provides the advantage that unknown param-\neters can easily be fitted, avoiding the danger of over-fitting. Further, it is\npartly analytically tractable and allows to understand which basic mecha-\nnisms give rise to the system\u2019s behaviour. In particular, we explore to what\nextent experimental data can be reproduced by the simplifying assumption\nthat zeaxanthin directly acts as a quencher. Both, agreement and discrep-\nancies between simulation and data allow for hypotheses on the molecular\nnature of the quenching processes. Further, based on our analysis, we put\nforth suggestions for new experiments and more sophisticated models which\nmay further clarify molecular aspects of NPQ.\n2. Model\nNPQ processes are associated with PSII. The observed quenching dynam-\nics take place on the order of seconds to minutes. These two basic observa-\ntions of NPQ motivate the following simplifying assumptions of our model:\na) we only consider processes in PSII; b) We approximate the fast dynamics\nof charge separation and oxygen evolution by a quasi steady-state approx-\nimation. The latter approximation is reasonable because charge separation\nand oxygen evolution occur on time scales of milliseconds and faster and,\nsince our model aims to simulate the quenching dynamics, the fast processes\ncan be assumed to be in a stationary state on the time scale of seconds and\nslower.\nThe model is kept as simple as possible, the basic scheme is given in\nFig. 1. Light absorption leads to excitation of chlorophyll molecules in the\nlight harvesting complexes (LHCs). This excitation energy is subsequently\ntransferred to chlorophylls associated with the RC, where it is used to sepa-\nrate charges, leading to a positively charged donor and a negatively charged\nacceptor. NPQ inhibits excitation energy transfer and allows dissipation of\nthe excitation energy as heat. In the model, light harvesting, excitation\nenergy transfer and charge separation are described by a single transition\nfrom state A1, representing open RCs, to state A2, representing a state with\n3\n2O H+ H+H2O\nv3 v4\nv5\nv6\nv7\nv8\nv9\nv1 H+\nv2\nOEC\nA\nA\nA\n1\n2 3\nPQH2\nPQ\nN 0N\nADP+Pi\nstromalumen\nATP\nLHC\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the model. Light is absorbed by the light harvesting\ncomplexes (LHCs). Excitation energy is transferred to the open RCs (A1), leading to\ncharge separation (A2). This process is inhibited by an active quencher (N). The oxygen\nevolving complex (OEC) re-reduces the donor side of the RC, resulting in state A3 and\nthe release of protons by water splitting. The acceptor side is re-oxidised by PQ, which\nreceives protons from the stroma. PQ is re-oxidised by Cytb6f, which is considered as\nexternal to the model and not shown in the figure. This re-oxidation involves proton\nrelease into the lumen. High proton concentration in the lumen triggers activation of a\nquencher (N0 and N represent the inactive and active form, respectively). The proton\ngradient drives the production of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). ATP is\nconsumed by external processes. State A3 can be excited but not use the excitation energy\nfor charge separation. The non-quenched fraction of this excitation energy is emitted as\nfluorescence (green arrow). The stoichiometries of the reactions are not shown.\nseparated charges. The rate v1 of this process is described by Eq. (A.5)\nwhich takes into account that this process is ultimately driven by incoming\n4\nlight (k1) and inhibited by an active quencher (N). During re-reduction of\nthe electron donor (v2) by the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) one proton\nis released into the lumen per absorbed photon. The resulting state A3 is\nre-oxidised on the acceptor side (v3) by electron transfer to plastoquinone\n(PQ), which receives protons from the stroma. The respective rates v2 and\nv3 are assumed to follow multilinear kinetics, the rate equations are given by\nEqs. (A.6) and (A.7). In principle, recharging the donor and acceptor sides\n(v2 and v3, respectively) may occur in opposite order, resulting in a four state\ndescription of the RCs. Such a four-state description of the RCs has been\nconsidered in Laisk et al. (1997). However, we found that for the parameters\nused here the additional state, in which only the acceptor side is re-oxidised,\nis almost not occupied and can therefore be neglected, leading to the present\nthree-state description of the RCs.\nReduced PQ is re-oxidised by the cytochrome b6f (Cytb6f) complex and\nre-oxidation is coupled with a release of protons into the lumen. For our\nminimal model, we draw the system boundary at this step and consider the\nCytb6f pool as a constant, external quantity. This quantity can thus be\nincluded in the rate constant k4 and the resulting linear rate law is given by\nEq. (A.8).\nWater splitting and PQ re-oxidation produces a proton gradient over the\nthylakoid membrane. The plastidic ATP synthase couples the resulting pro-\nton motive force to the biochemical synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic\nphosphate. For 14 protons which pass the membrane, 3 molecules of ATP\nare produced (Seelert et al., 2000). This coupling leads to a \u2019dynamic\u2019 equi-\nlibrium constant for the biochemical reaction which depends on the proton\ngradient and is determined by (see also Laisk et al. 2006)\nKeq = e\n\u2212\n\u2206G\nRT with \u2206G = \u2206G0 \u2212 ln 10 \u00b7\u2206pH \u00b7\n14\n3\n\u00b7RT, (1)\nwhere \u2206G0 is the standard change in Gibbs energy, R the universal gas\nconstant and T the temperature. The \u2206pH dependent dynamic equilibrium\nis incorporated in a simple mass action kinetic rate law, leading to the ATP\nsynthesis rate\nv5 = k5\n(\n[ADP]\u2212\n[ATP]\nK \u2032eq\n)\n, with K \u2032eq = [Pi] \u00b7Keq, (2)\nwhere the inorganic phosphate concentration [Pi] is assumed to be constant.\n5\nFurther, protons may passively leak into the stroma (v8). To balance\nthe ATP production, we introduce one reaction (v9) representing all ATP\nconsuming processes. These processes are assumed to follow mass action\nrate laws, see Eqs. (A.12) and (A.13).\nAn essential process associated with NPQ is the xanthophyll cycle. In\nthis cycle, violaxanthin is deepoxidised in two steps to zeaxanthin by a lu-\nminally located deepoxidase, and the reverse epoxidation is catalysed by a\nstromal epoxidase. It has been shown (e.g., Pfu\u00a8ndel and Dilley, 1993) that\nthe deepoxidation reaction is strongly dependent on the luminal pH, whereas\nthe epoxidation reaction is independent (Gilmore et al., 1994). These findings\nare incorporated into the model by a simplified description of the xantho-\nphyll cycle, in which a quencher can be either inactive or active (denoted\nN0 and N , respectively) and the total amount of quencher is assumed to be\nconstant and is normalised to unity, N + N0 = 1. The quencher is assumed\nto be activated with the pH-dependent rate\nv6 = k6(1\u2212N)\n[H+]\nn\n[H+]n + KQ\nn . (3)\nThis phenomenological Hill-type rate law is supported by experimental data\nby Pfu\u00a8ndel and Dilley (1993), in which the rate of the deepoxidation reaction\nwas determined for different pH values. An inflection pH of 6 (represented by\nthe constant KQ) was observed and a fit to the data yielded a Hill coefficient\nof n = 5.3. For the inactivation rate v7, a simple mass action law is assumed,\nsee Eq. (A.11).\nBesides the conserved quencher concentration (see above), three further\nconserved moieties restrict the system variables: The total number of RCs\nis denoted by D, the total (reduced and oxidised) PQ pool by X and the\nadenosine phosphate pool in the stroma by Atot.\n3. Results\n3.1. Quasi steady-state approximation\nProcesses within the RCs are much faster than NPQ induction. We\nthus apply a quasi steady-state approximation to the variables describing\nthe states of the RCs (A1, A2 and A3) as well as the variable describing the\noxidised fraction of the PQ pool (P ). For this, we consider the luminal pro-\nton concentration, H, and the activity of the quencher, N , as approximately\n6\nconstant on the time scale of the fast processes involving the excitation and\nclosing of the RCs. Setting the rate equations of the fast variables to zero\nleads to a quadratic equation, dependent on light intensity and quenching\nactivity, from which the oxidised fraction of the PQ pool can be determined\nas the positive root (see Eq. B.6 in Appendix B).\nIn the quasi steady-state approximation, the light driven proton influx\ninto the lumen is proportional to the rate of PQ re-oxidation, which is given\nas v4 = k4 \u00b7 (X \u2212 P ), where X \u2212 P is the concentration of reduced PQ.\nConsequently, the quasi steady-state concentration of reduced PQ is decisive\nfor the photosynthetic rate.\nThe overall excitation rate is given by the non-quenched fraction of the\ntotal excitation, k1(1 \u2212 N). For the limit of large excitation rates, the PQ\npool is maximally reduced. In this limit, the fraction of reduced PQ, denoted\nq = (X \u2212 P )\/X, is given by\nq =\nk+3 D\nk+3 D + k4\n\u2248 1, (4)\nwhere the approximation holds assuming that acceptor re-oxidation occurs\nsignificantly faster than PQ re-oxidation (k+3 D \u00c0 k4). In the opposite limit\nof no RC excitation, the PQ pool is completely oxidised (q = 0).\nTo study the influence of parameter values on the quasi steady-state, we\nsystematically vary each parameter and compare the reduction state and re-\nsulting net proton import rate to a reference parameter set. The reference\nparameters have been derived from the literature and were subsequently fit-\nted manually to experimental data (see Appendix C). In Fig. 2 the effects\nof the most influential parameters are depicted. While increasing the re-\noxidation rate, k4, leads to a decreasing of the reduced PQ fraction (top left),\nthe net proton influx (top right) is nevertheless increased. Interestingly, the\nreduction state of the PQ pool is mostly affected for low RC excitation rates\nwhile the proton influx changes for high rates. In low light, an increased\nre-oxidation will shift the balance of the PQ pool to more oxidised levels,\nhowever, the increased rate compensates the lower level of reduced PQ, re-\nsulting in unaltered net proton import rates. In high light, however, the PQ\npool is maximally reduced regardless of the re-oxidation rate, explaining why\nan increased rate in this regime leads to higher proton import rates. Varying\nthe total PQ pool has a very similar effect (centre row) and the explanation\nis analogous to that of changing the re-oxidation rate. Increasing the total\nnumber of RCs leads to a more reduced PQ pool.

The three system parameters k4\n(PQ re-oxidation rate constant, top row), X (total PQ pool, centre row) and D (total RCs,\nbottom row) were varied and the effect of the quasi steady-state values were monitored. In\neach case, the values are shown in a double logarithmic plot as a function of RC activation\nrate, (1 \u2212 N)k1, for the reference parameters (black line), a two- and four-fold increase\n(red dashed and dash-dotted lines, respectively) and a two- and four-fold decrease of the\ncorresponding parameter (blue dashed and dash-dotted lines, respectively). The parameter\nvalues used for the reference state are given in Table C.1.\nproton import is also increased. However, this effect can only be observed for\nlow RC excitation rates because under high light the PQ pool is maximally\nreduced irrespective of the numbers of RCs. The remaining parameters en-\ntering Eq. (B.6) only marginally influence the quasi steady-state reduction\nstate and proton import rate, because water splitting and re-oxidation of the\ndonor side of the RCs are assumed to occur orders of magnitudes faster than\nthe other processes.\n3.2. Steady state photosynthesis\nUnder constant light conditions, the photosynthetic rate will approach a\nstationary state which is determined by a balanced proton influx into the\nlumen and out-flux through the ATP synthase and proton leaks. Under\nsteady-state conditions, the model equations can be simplified into a single\n8\nequation depending only on one variable (the luminal free proton concentra-\ntion, H \u2013 see Appendix D), which can be numerically solved. In the model,\nthe resulting pH critically depends on the proton accumulation due to the\nactivity of the RCs, on ATP synthesis, external ATP consumption and on the\nstationary quenching activity. Based on results of Pfu\u00a8ndel and Dilley (1993)\non the pH dependence of the deepoxidation of violaxanthin and constant ac-\ntivity of the epoxidase (Gilmore et al., 1994), we assume a strong induction\nof quencher activation by low lumen pH and a constant deactivation rate.\nThis leads to a sigmoid stationary quencher activity in dependence on lumen\n5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nqu\nen\nch\ner\n a\nct\nivi\nty\n, N\nStationary quencher activity in dependence on lumen pH\n \n \nKQ = 5.8\nKQ = 6\nKQ = 6.2\n5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nlumen pH\nm\nm\no\nl(m\nol \nCh\nl s\n)\u22121\nproton flux balance\n \n \nH+ utilization\nH+ accumulation\nFigure 3: Stationary variables in dependence on lumen pH.

The red\nlines indicate the proton accumulation rate through the RC activity, including protons gen-\nerated by the OEC and protons released in the lumen by PQ translocation (rates v2 and v4,\nrespectively). Calculations were done for a constant light density (800 \u00b5Em\u22122s\u22121).

How the inflection point\ndetermines the stationary lumen pH is illustrated by proton accumulation\nand utilisation rates in dependence on the pH. In the lower panel of Fig. 3,\nthe proton utilisation rate by ATP synthase activity is depicted in blue. The\nproton accumulation rate in the lumen as a result of RC activity (water split-\nting and proton translocation by PQ) is depicted in red. Lower inflection pH\n(KQ) results in a lower quenching activation and therefore in higher proton\naccumulation rates in the lumen. The choice of KQ = 6 seems reasonable\nsince a moderate drop in pH will result in quenching while simultaneously\nthe stationary ATP synthase activity for moderate to strong light works with\napproximately 75% of its maximal activity.\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n6\n6.5\n7\nsteady state variables depending on light intensity\npH\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n0\n0.5\n1\nqu\nen\nch\nin\ng,\n N\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n0\n0.5\n1\nAT\nP \n(re\nlat\nive\n)\nlight intensity, \u00b5E m\u22122 s\u22121\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\npH\nresponse coefficients\n \n \nD\nX\nk5\nk9\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n\u22121\n0\n1\nqu\nen\nch\nin\ng,\n N\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n\u22121\n0\n1\nAT\nP\nlight intensity, \u00b5E m\u22122 s\u22121\nFigure 4: Steady state model behaviour for different light intensities.

Right: Response\ncoefficients in dependence on the light intensity for the four critical system parameters total\nRCs (D), total adenosine phosphate pool (X), ATP synthase activity (k5) and external\nATP consumption (k9). Calculations were performed with the reference parameters given\nin Table C.1.\nIn Fig. 4 (left) steady state lumen pH, quenching activity and the ATP\nlevel relative to the total adenosine phosphate pool are shown as functions of\nphoton flux density (PFD). A sharp drop in pH already for low light intensi-\nties can be observed. For higher intensities the pH level declines only mod-\nerately, in perfect accordance to experimental observations (Ruban et al.,\n2001). Quenching is induced already for low light intensities, however, it\ncontinues to increase for increased photon influx. Similarly, the stationary\nstromal ATP level increases with increasing light, however, the changes for\n10\nhigh light conditions (above 1000 \u00b5Em\u22122s\u22121) are very moderate. The fact\nthat for very low light an ATP level close to zero is predicted, is not in accor-\ndance with the observed nocturnal ATP:ADP ratio of around 1:2 (Heineke\net al., 1991). This shortcoming can be explained by the simplifying model\nassumptions. The model includes ATP synthase as the only source of stro-\nmal ATP and, since in the absence of light this activity ceases, the model\npredicts zero ATP in the dark.\nTo study which parameters are most critically influencing the system\u2019s\nsteady state behaviour, we systematically varied parameters and numeri-\ncally recorded the changes on the steady state values. The strength of a\nparameter\u2019s influence is quantified by its response coefficient. For any sys-\ntem variable y and parameter p, the normalised response coefficient is defined\nas\nRyp =\np\ny\n\u2202y\n\u2202p\n=\n\u2202 ln y\n\u2202 ln p\n. (5)\nNaturally, the response coefficients depend on the reference state and thus\non PFD. In Fig. 4 (right) four selected response coefficients are plotted as\nfunctions of the light intensity. An increased number of RCs (D) has no\nsignificant influence on the steady-state lumen pH, but \u2013 in particular for\nthe low light regime \u2013 leads to increased quenching activity and a higher\nstromal ATP level. Increasing the total PQ pool (X), on the other hand,\nresults in changes predominantly in the high light regime, by leading to a de-\ncreased lumen pH, increased quenching and increased ATP levels. Control of\nthe maximal ATP synthase activity, k5, is relatively small and the effects on\nquenching and ATP level are opposite. This behaviour is expected because\na higher synthase activity promotes a faster proton consumption. Simulta-\nneously, ATP production in the stroma is increased and thus, for unchanged\nconsumption rate constants, the ATP level must increase. Critical control\nis exerted by the external ATP consumption process, k9. A higher ATP re-\nquirement will lead to an increasing lumen pH, and simultaneously strongly\nreduce quenching activity and stromal ATP levels. The latter result should\nbe interpreted carefully since the assumption of linear kinetics for the overall\nATP consumption is certainly an over-simplification. Metabolic regulation of\nthe ATP demand is not included in the model and thus homoeostatic effects\non the stationary ATP levels cannot be reproduced.\n11\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nquenching activity, N\nlu\nm\nen\n p\nH\nPhase trajectories for dark\u2212light transitions\n \n \n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nFigure 5: Trajectory of the two variables, luminal pH and quenching activity, during tran-\nsitions from dark to light and vice versa.

The markers\non the trajectories are set in regular intervals of 1 s to visualise the different time scales on\nwhich the system is operating. The black line in the graph depicts the stationary states\ncalculated for different light intensities.\n3.3. Light-dark transitions\nNext, we investigate how the model behaves under sudden changes in ex-\nternal light conditions. For this, simulations were started in the dark-adapted\nstate and the transitions into light-adapted states for different PFDs were\nsimulated. The phase plane trajectories of the quenching activity, N , and\nthe lumen pH during the switch from dark to light and light to dark are\ndepicted in Fig. 5. For all light intensities, an immediate decrease of pH is\nobserved. Concomitantly, ATP synthase becomes active and stromal ATP\nlevels rise (not shown in the plot). For light intensities above a threshold, pH\nlevels drop further. Under such conditions, proton export by ATP synthase\ninitially cannot balance proton accumulation. However, low pH triggers acti-\nvation of the quencher resulting in a rapid alleviation of proton accumulation\n12\nand the pH starts to rise within seconds. Quenching activation continues and\nthe pH keeps rising on a slower time scale and the steady state value for the\ngiven light intensity is approximated. The reverse transition also displays\ntwo time scales. Without photon flux no protons are pumped into the lumen\nand pH begins to rise and ATP production ceases. With slower dynamics,\nthe quenching agent is deactivated and eventually reaches its dark adapted\nsteady state.\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nha\nlf\u2212\ntim\ne \nT 1\n\/2\n,\n \ns\nCharacterstic quenching times and response coefficients\n \n \ndark\u2212light\nlight\u2212dark\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n\u221210\n\u22125\n0\n5\n10\nre\nsp\non\nse\n c\noe\nffi\ncie\nnt\ns\nT 1\n\/2\n \n(da\nrk\u2212\nlig\nht)\nPFD, \u00b5Em\u22122s\u22121\n \n k6\nk7\nk5\nk9\nk4\n0.8 1 1.25\n0.25\n0.5\n1\n2\n4\nrelative parameter (k9) variation\nre\nla\ntiv\ne \nha\nlf\u2212\ntim\ne \n(T 1\n\/2\n) v\nari\nati\non\nInfluence of ATP consumption on quenching induction time\n \n \n300\n500\n700\n900\n1100\n1300\nFigure 6: Quenching half-times and response coefficients for the quenching activation\ntime for the most critical system parameters. In the top left panel, the activation (red)\nand deactivation (blue) half-times are shown as functions of the PFD of the induced\nlight. For the same light intensities, the numerically determined control coefficients for\nthe most influential parameters are depicted in the lower panel. The right graph depicts\nthe responses of the half-times for non-infinitesimal changes of the parameter k9 for the\nlight intensities 300, 500, 700, 900, 1100 and 1300 \u00b5Em\u22122s\u22121 (light grey to black).\nTo study which system parameters determine the characteristic times of\nquenching activation, we determine the half-times, T1\/2, defined as the time\nthe quenching variable N requires to reach the mid-point between the dark\nand light adapted steady state values. In Fig. 6 (top left), the half-times for\nthe activation and deactivation are plotted as functions of PFD. Deactiva-\ntion dynamics under light-dark transition (blue line) are independent on the\ninitial light intensity. The reason for this is that the only process included in\nthe model promoting the deactivation (rate v7) depends exclusively on the\namount of active quencher. Interestingly, the transition from dark to light\nshows a strong dependence on light intensity. Dynamics are faster for higher\nphoton flux density, which can be understood considering that stronger pho-\nton influx leads to a more rapid proton accumulation which in turn acceler-\nates activation of the quencher. The control of the characteristic quenching\n13\nactivation time is complex. In Fig. 6 (bottom left), the response coefficients\nof the activation half-times for the most influential parameters are plotted\nas functions of the light intensity. The control of the parameters directly\ninvolved in quenching activation\/deactivation (k6 and k7, respectively) show\nan expected behaviour. An increase of either parameter will lead to a faster\nquenching activation. For low light intensities, the deactivation parameter\nand for high intensities the activation parameter dominates, reflecting the\ncorresponding relative rates under the respective conditions. However, the\nrate parameters for reoxidation of the PQ pool (k4) and those related to ATP\nproduction and consumption (k5 and k9, respectively) show an unexpected\nand highly unusual behaviour. The response coefficients depend strongly on\nthe light intensity and display the largest absolute values for light intensi-\nties between 700 and 1000 \u00b5Em\u22122s\u22121. In this region, increasing external\nATP consumption will for example lead to a drastic slow down of quenching\nactivation. Since response coefficients are only local measures that charac-\nterise responses upon infinitesimal changes of the system parameters, this\nbehaviour hints at non-linear responses for larger changes. To explore this\ninteresting behaviour further, we exemplarily depict in Fig. 6 (right) the rela-\ntive change in half-time as a function of the varied parameter k9 for external\nATP consumption for various light intensities. For a wide range of light\nintensities, the control of k9 is bimodal in the sense that it exerts a small\nnegative control on the half time below a critical threshold (slight negative\nslope in Fig. 6, right) and a strong positive control above this threshold. A\ncloser investigation of the time courses of the quenching dynamics reveals\nthat in the regime of low negative control the pH values temporarily drop\nsignificantly below their final stationary levels, analogous to the trajectories\nin Fig. 5 for light intensities of 800 \u00b5Em\u22122s\u22121 and above. Since under these\nconditions, quenching activation is maximal during the transient phase of low\npH, the half-time is predominantly determined by the final level of quenching\nactivation. Since increased values of k9 lead to reduced levels of stationary\nquenching activity (see Fig. 4, centre right), the mid point is reached faster,\nexplaining the negative control on the half-time. Under conditions without\nsignificant transient decrease of pH, the quenching dynamics are strongly pH\ndependent and thus largely determined by the stationary pH. Since increased\nvalues of k9 lead to increased stationary pH (see Fig. 4, top right), quench-\ning dynamics will be considerably slower, thus explaining the strong positive\ncontrol on the quenching half-time.\n14\n3.4. Comparison to experimental data\nCommonly used to study photosynthesis and NPQ experimentally is the\nso-called pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorescence technique. In these\nexperiments, plant leaves (or algal suspensions) are usually dark adapted be-\nfore the actual measurement and during the experiment the leaf is exposed\nto a weak (non-actinic) modulated measuring light, giving rise to the mini-\nmum (F0) chlorophyll fluorescence signal. Furthermore, the leaf is subjected\nto short saturating light pulses - transiently closing all RCs - giving rise to\nthe maximum (FM) fluorescence. Additionally, actinic light of varying inten-\nsity and duration can be applied, inducing light adaptation processes in the\nphotosynthetic apparatus, in particular NPQ. Quenching of qE-type results\nin excess excitation energy dissipation as heat and thus protects PSII from\ndetrimental over-excitation.\nSince chlorophyll fluorescence is not a system variable, it has to be calcu-\nlated from the simulation output. If a chlorophyll molecule associated with a\nRC is excited, the excitation energy can be either used for charge separation\n(only in open RCs), emitted as light, leading to fluorescence, or dissipated as\nheat. In our model, states A1 and A3 can be excited and thus, can emit flu-\norescence. Fluorescence emanating from A1 represents the amount of energy\nnot used for charge separation and corresponds to the minimum chlorophyll\nfluorescence (F0) in the dark. We do not include F0 in our calculation for the\nfluorescence signal because we do not resolve excitation and charge separa-\ntion in the reaction v1. Thus, only state A3 is included in the calculation of\nthe fluorescence signal. The activity of the quencher, N , determines the frac-\ntion of excitation energy emitted as heat, while the non-quenched fraction,\n1\u2212N , is emitted as fluorescence. We therefore assume that the fluorescence\nsignal is proportional to\nF = (1\u2212N) \u00b7\nA3\nD\n. (6)\nUsually, PAM data are normalised to the highest measured fluorescence sig-\nnal (FM) being set to 1. Since the fluorescence signal defined by Eq. (6)\nis not capable to reflect the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence (F0) in the\ndark, we additionally normalise the lowest measured value to 0. It has to\nbe mentioned that of course F0 is not 0 but reflects loss processes in the\nantenna system. To compare simulation to experimental data, we perform\nthe same normalisation for the calculated fluorescence signal. In Fig. 7 the\nmeasured and simulated fluorescence signals are presented for three differ-\nent light intensities (300, 600 and 1200 \u00b5Em\u22122s\u22121).

Ex-\nperimental data was normalised such that the largest value equals 1 and the lowest observed\nvalue equals zero. Fluorescence was calculated from the simulated data as described in\nthe text and the resulting values were normalised as the experimental data.\nmodel reproduces the experimental data fairly well, at least qualitatively.\nFor the moderate and high light intensities, the simulated light adaptation\nprocess reflects the experimental observations with high accuracy. However,\nfor low light conditions, the experimental peak intensities during illumina-\ntion show a slight increase after an initial drop. This behaviour is attributed\nto the fact that in vivo ATP synthase is inhibited in the dark and under low\nlight intensities re-activation is slow. This process is not considered in our\nmodel and therefore an increase of fluorescence intensity during constant il-\nlumination cannot be reproduced. A further systematic discrepancy between\nsimulation and data is observed after the light-dark transition. The simu-\nlated de-activation of the quenching activity is, under all light conditions,\nconsiderably slower than the experimentally observed relaxation dynamics.\n4. Discussion\nWe have presented a highly simplified model of NPQ in PSII which serves\nthe goals to a) investigate stationary photosynthetic rates, b) analyse NPQ\ninduced adaptive dynamics of PSII upon changing light conditions, c) study\n16\nthe effects of variations of important pool sizes and reaction rate parameters\nand d) explore to what extent this simplistic approach is sufficient to repro-\nduce experimental data obtained from PAM fluorescence measurements.\nThe simple model structure poses the advantage that many analytic for-\nmulas can be derived and dynamics can be thoroughly investigated. The gen-\neral behaviour of the model is realistic. Simulated steady state observables\nlie in realistic ranges and the principle features of the dynamic quenching\nprocess are plausible. Under the transition from dark to light, two differ-\nent dynamics are observed, depending on whether the lumen pH undergoes\na transient drastic drop. Under low light conditions, proton accumulation\ncan easily be balanced by ATP synthase activity and quenching induction is\nrelatively slow. However, sudden exposure to high light leads to a situation\nwhere proton accumulation cannot be balanced by consumption through ATP\nsynthase and quenching induction is faster, leading to feedback reduction of\nproton accumulation and proton flux is balanced within seconds.\nDespite the general plausibility of the simulations, some systematic dis-\ncrepancies to measured data are apparent. Most strikingly, the NPQ deacti-\nvation during the transition from light to dark is too slow in the simulation\nwhen compared to experimental PAM curves. The reason for this must be\nsought in the simplifying assumptions about the quenching process. We have\nassumed only a single quenching agent being directly related to zeaxanthin.\nHowever, it is well known that other factors play important roles (Horton\net al., 2008). In particular, protonation induced conformational changes in\nthe LHCs seem to contribute significantly to the qE-type quenching pro-\ncesses (Lokstein et al., 1994; Ha\u00a8rtel et al., 1996; Lokstein et al., 2002). It\nis still remarkable that the highly simplified assumption that zeaxanthin\ndirectly acts as the sole quencher is sufficient for \u2013 at least \u2013 qualitative re-\nproduction of the data, confirming a major role of zeaxanthin in qE-type\nquenching. The fitted parameters for the quenching activation and deac-\ntivation processes (k6 and k7, respectively) are about ten-fold higher than\nthe measured rates for de-epoxidation and epoxidation (Pfu\u00a8ndel and Dilley,\n1993). This indicates that the assumption of zeaxanthin being the quencher\nN (a variable in the range from 0 to 1) in the model is too simplistic. It rather\nsupports the hypothesis that zeaxanthin is necessary for NPQ build-up but\na few molecules of zeaxanthin are sufficient for maximum quenching (Ha\u00a8rtel\net al., 1996). This hypothesis could be tested by systematically exposing\nplants to different durations of high actinic illumination and subsequently\nrecording the quenching relaxation dynamics, which should be slower for\n17\nlonger illumination times, due to higher levels of zeaxanthin accumulation.\nBesides including such a saturation effect of zeaxanthin, the model can\nbe extended to account for other qE factors, such as altered conformations\nof the LHCs. It will be interesting to compare the prediction of a more\nsophisticated model to PAM fluorometric data obtained for mutants in which\nthe xanthophyll cycle is altered, such as the NPQ mutants of Arabidopsis\nthaliana (Lokstein et al., 2002).\nIn summary, our presented simplified model provides a useful theoretical\ndescription of PSII with which general dynamic properties of the photosyn-\nthetic light reactions and the adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus to\nexcess light can be studied. The model is easily extendable to include more\nmechanistic aspects of the qE-type quenching processes and may thus serve\nas a theoretical basis to accompany experimental approaches to explore the\nmolecular basis of NPQ.\n5. Materials and Methods\nChlorophyll fluorescence measurements were done with attached wild-\ntype Arabidopsis thaliana leaves using a pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM)\nfluorometer FMS 2 (Hansatech) at ambient temperature as previously de-\nscribed (Lokstein et al., 2002).\nFunding\nThis work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education\nand Research through the Systems Biology Research Initiative \u201cGoFORSYS\u201d\n(TH, HL, SS, KT) and by the Scottish Funding Council through the Scottish\nUniversities Life Science Alliance, SULSA (OE).\nAppendix A. Model equations\nIn the model represented in Fig. 1, water, oxygen, stromal protons and\ninorganic phosphate are considered external quantities and their concentra-\ntion is held constant. The remaining variables A1, A2 and A3 describe the\nRCs, P and Q quantify the oxidised and reduced PQ pool, respectively, H\nthe proton concentration in the lumen, N0 and N the inactive and active\nquencher, respectively, and S and T describe the stromal ADP and ATP\n18\nconcentration respectively. These variables are restricted by the conserved\nquantities\nconserved number of RCs : A1 + A2 + A3 = D (A.1)\nconserved PQ pool : P + Q = X (A.2)\nconserved adenosine phosphate pool : S + T = Atot (A.3)\nconserved quencher : N0 + N = 1. (A.4)\nChoosing A1, A2, P , H, N and T as independent variables, the rate expres-\nsions read\nv1 = (1\u2212N) \u00b7 k1 \u00b7 A1 (A.5)\nv2 = k2 \u00b7 A2 (A.6)\nv3 = k\n+\n3 \u00b7 (D \u2212 A1 \u2212 A2) \u00b7 P \u2212 k\n\u2212\n3 A1 \u00b7 (X \u2212 P ) (A.7)\nv4 = k4 \u00b7 (X \u2212 P ) (A.8)\nv5 = k5\n(\nAtot \u2212 T\n(\n1 +\n1\nKeq\n\u2032(H)\n))\n(A.9)\nwhere Keq\n\u2032(H) = [Pi] \u00b7 e\n\u2212\n\u2206G0\nRT \u00b7\n(\n[H+]stroma\nH\n) 14\n3\nv6 = k6(1\u2212N)\nHn\nHn + KQ\nn (A.10)\nv7 = k7 \u00b7N (A.11)\nv8 = k8 \u00b7 (H \u2212 [H\n+]stroma) (A.12)\nv9 = k9 \u00b7 T. (A.13)\nThe rate k1 is dependent on the photon influx and determines the external\nlight input of the system. To convert PFD into an RC activation rate, we\nassume\nk1 = cPFD \u00b7 PFD, (A.14)\nwhere PFD is the PFD measured in \u00b5Em\u22122s\u22121 and cPFD is a manually fitted\nconversion factor. The differential equations for the six free variables read\nA\u02d91 = v3 \u2212 v1 (A.15)\nA\u02d92 = v1 \u2212 v2 (A.16)\nP\u02d9 = v4 \u2212 v3 (A.17)\n19\nH\u02d9 = bH\n(\n2v2 + v4 \u2212\n14\n3\nv5 \u2212 v8\n)\n(A.18)\nN\u02d9 = v6 \u2212 v7 (A.19)\nT\u02d9 = v5 \u2212 v9. (A.20)\nFor Eq. (A.18) determining the rate of change of the free proton concentra-\ntion, we assume that protons are highly buffered in the lumen and, follow-\ning Laisk et al. (2006) we apply a simple proportionality between the total\nnumber of protons and those contributing to the free proton concentration\nby introducing the buffering constant bH .\nAppendix B. Quasi steady-state approximation\nTransitions and electron transport within the RCs is considerably faster\nthan the time scales on which quenching processes are observed. Thus, rates\nv1, v2 and v3 are orders of magnitude faster than the other reaction rates.\nWe therefore assume that the variables A1, A2, and P are approximately in\nsteady state when considering the slower time scale of the other variables\nand set Eqs.(A.15)\u2013(A.17) to zero,\nv3 \u2212 v1 = k\n+\n3 (D \u2212 A1 \u2212 A2)P \u2212 k\n\u2212\n3 A1(X \u2212 P )\u2212 fk1A1 = 0 (B.1)\nv1 \u2212 v2 = fk1A1 \u2212 k2A2 = 0 (B.2)\nv3 \u2212 v4 = k\n+\n3 (D \u2212 A1 \u2212 A2)P \u2212 k\n\u2212\n3 A1(X \u2212 P )\u2212 k4(X \u2212 P ) = 0,(B.3)\nwhere f = 1\u2212N has been introduced. Eq. (B.2) implies\nA2 =\nfk1\nk2\nA1 (B.4)\nand subtracting Eq. (B.3) from Eq. (B.1) yields\nA1 =\nk4\nfk1\n(X \u2212 P ). (B.5)\nEliminating A1 and A2 from Eq. (B.3) yields the quadratic equation\nP 2(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2) + P\n(\nk+3 D \u2212 \u03b1X + 2\u03b2X + k4\n)\n\u2212 \u03b2X2 \u2212 k4X = 0, (B.6)\nwhere the abbreviations\n\u03b1 = k+3 k4\n(\n1\nfk1\n+\n1\nk2\n)\nand \u03b2 =\nk\u22123 k4\nfk1\n(B.7)\n20\nhave been introduced. Eq. (B.6) together with Eqs. (B.5) and (B.4) allows\nto determine the oxidised PQ and the states of the RCs in dependence on\nthe light influx (k1) and the quenching status (f = 1 \u2212 N). The condition\nk+3 > k\n\u2212\n3 , which is certainly fulfilled because PQ reduction is energetically\ndriven by the activated RCs, ensures that Eq. (B.6) has exactly one positive\nroot (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 > 0 and the left hand side of Eq. (B.6) is negative for P = 0).\nThe uniqueness of the solution guaranteed allows to define a function\nP = P (k1, N), (B.8)\nby which the model equations can be reduced to a three variable system,\ngoverned by Eqs. (A.18)\u2013(A.20),\n1\nbH\nH\u02d9 = 3k4(X \u2212 P (k1, N))\u2212\n14\n3\nk5\n(\nAtot \u2212 T\n(\n1 +\n1\nKeq\n\u2032(H)\n))\n(B.9)\n\u2212k8(H \u2212 [H\n+]stroma)\nN\u02d9 = k6(1\u2212N)\nHn\nHn + KQ\nn \u2212 k7N (B.10)\nT\u02d9 = k5\n(\nAtot \u2212 T\n(\n1 +\n1\nKeq\n\u2032(H)\n))\n\u2212 k9T. (B.11)\nAppendix C. Choice of Parameters\nThe parameters chosen for the reference state are given in Table C.1.\nSeveral parameters are available from literature resources. Where applica-\nble, the corresponding sources are given in the last column. The units of\nconcentration chosen for the system variables are mmol(mol Chl)\u22121. The\nconversion from standard concentration units were performed using values\nfrom Laisk et al. (2006), who assumed a Chlorophyll content of 350 \u00b710\u22126 mol\nper m2 thylakoid membrane and lumen and stroma volumes of 0.0014 l m\u22122\nand 0.0112 l m\u22122, respectively. Thus, 1 mmol(mol Chl)\u22121 corresponds to\n2.5 \u00b7 10\u22124M in the lumen and 3.2 \u00b7 10\u22125M in the stroma. The plastoquinone\nre-oxidation rate constant (k4) and the ATP synthesis and external ATP\nconsumption rate constants (k5 and k9, respectively) were manually fitted\nwithin reasonable ranges to reflect realistic stationary ATP:ADP ratios for\na wide range of light conditions. The quenching activation and deactivation\nrate constants (k6 and k7, respectively) were first obtained from the litera-\nture and then manually fitted to reflect experimentally obtained quenching\n21\nTable C.1: Rate Parameters used throughout the paper as a reference.\nparameter value reference\/comment\nk2 3.4 \u00b7 106 s\u22121 Sonneveld et al.

Steady state solution\nUnder constant light conditions, the system will assume a stationary state\nwhich is determined by H\u02d9 = N\u02d9 = T\u02d9 = 0. Following Eqs. (B.10 and B.11),\nthe stationary values of N and T can be expressed as functions of H:\nN(H) =\n1\n1 + k7\nk6\nHn+KQ\nn\nHn\n, (D.1)\nT (H) =\nAtot\n1 + 1\nKeq\n\u2032(H)\n+ k5\nk9\n. (D.2)\nThese expressions allow to eliminate T and N from the steady state condition\nH\u02d9 = 0, resulting in an equation which only depends on H. Solving this\nequation numerically yields the steady state pH level for constant light influx,\n22\nfrom which the other steady state variables may be determined by Eqs. (D.1)\nand (D.2).\nReferences\nFrank, H., Cua, A., Chynwat, V., Joung, A., Gosztola, D., Wasielewski, M.,\n1994.
