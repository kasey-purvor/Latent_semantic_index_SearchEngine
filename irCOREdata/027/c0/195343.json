Numerical ray-tracing models (such as Jones and Stephenson, 1975 and \nNorman et al., 1994) are very accurate but they have a high computational time. Analytic ray-\ntracing techniques able to ray trace through horizontal gradients along and in the direction of the ray \npath, (Norman and Cannon, 1997, 1999), are computationally less intensive than numerical ray \ntracing, and for this reason their use is particularly advantageous in HF applications as for example \nin the real-time frequency management of OTH (over-the-horizon) radar systems (Coleman, 1998).  \nIn this work three different predictions methods that approximate ray-tracing techniques were \ntested. The two methods IRI-95 and SIRM&BR_D are so called because they are based on the \nmonthly median electron density profiles provided by the models IRI-95 (Bilitza, 1990; Bilitza, \n2001) and SIRM (Zolesi et al., 1993; Zolesi et al., 1996) in conjunction with the Bradley-Dudeney \nmodel (Bradley and Dudeney, 1973), respectively. The third method is called ICEPAC because it is \nbased on the monthly median electron density profiles provided by the software package named \nICEPAC (Stewart F.G, undated). A description of these methods will be given in Section 2.  \nTime of flight measurements (TOF) as well as azimuthal angle of arrival measurements (AOA), on \nthe Uppsala - Bruntingthorpe radio link, have been performed during the period November 2006 \u2013 \nJanuary 2008. A description of the analysis conducted to validate the TOF measurements and obtain \nfrom these the hourly TOF median measurements associated with on great circle 1E and 1F \npropagation modes will be given in Section 3.  \nIn order to test the validity of the methods approximating the ray-tracing technique under \u201cquiet\u201d \nionospheric conditions, comparisons between the predictions provided by IRI-95, SIRM&BR_D, \nICEPAC and the TOF median measurements for the one hop propagation modes 1E and 1F were \ncarried out for different frequencies and seasons. Some results concerning such comparisons and the \ndiscussion of the same are presented in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. \n \n2 Description of methods that approximate ray tracing and data analysis \n \nThe International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) (Bilitza, 1990; Bilitza, 2001) is a global empirical \nmodel which provides monthly median electron density profiles. Over the years, testing and \nmodifications of IRI has continued in order to improve the model and several versions were \nproduced. In this work the IRI-95 prediction method uses the hourly monthly median electron \ndensity profiles predicted by IRI - 95 version. The SIRM&BR_D prediction method utilizes the \nmonthly median predictions of the ionospheric characteristics, foF2 and M(3000)F2, provided by \nSIRM (Zolesi et al., 1993; Zolesi et al., 1996) applied in conjunction with the Bradley - Dudeney \nmodel (Bradley and Dudeney, 1973) to calculate hourly monthly median electron density profiles. \nFor developing IRI-95 and SIRM&BR_D prediction methods, the monthly median electron density \nprofiles N = N(h) provided by IRI-95, and SIRM&BR_D have been used to calculate the vertical \nplasma frequency profiles fv = fv(h) at the mid-point of the Uppsala (Tx) - Bruntingthorpe (Rx) \nradio link. As the effect of Earth curvature is important for ground ranges greater than 500 km, the \ncurvature of the Earth and the known ground range (D = 1411 km) of the radio link, have been \ntaken into account for calculating the secant of the angle of incidence \uf06a of the ray at the base of the \nionosphere as a function of R, D, and h (R being the radius of the Earth) (Davies, 1990). The values \nof sec\uf06a = f(R, D, h), have been calculated assuming a very simple geometry based on ionospheric \nreflections taking place from a simple horizontal mirror at the appropriate height h (figure 1). \nSubsequently, the secant law was applied to calculate the oblique transmission frequencies fob = \nfvsec\uf06a. The length of the oblique ray path P = f(R, D, sec\uf06a), its corresponding TOF, and take off \nangle \uf044 = f(R, sec\uf06a) have been calculated from simple mathematical relationships deduced from the \ngeometry sketched in figure 1. It should be noted that the parameters  fob , P, TOF, h, and \uf044 (median \nvalues) calculated following the procedure described above are strictly related to each other. This \nmeans that, if TOF predictions come out reliable after comparing them with TOF median \nmeasurements, the other radio propagation path parameters such as fob , P,  h, and \uf044 should be also \nconsidered reliable. In other words, a comparison between TOF median prediction and TOF median \nmeasured can be considered suitable for testing indirectly the 'goodness' of prediction of all the \nother parameters.  \nThe software package ICEPAC (Ionospheric Communications Enhanced Profile Analysis and \nCircuit) is a full system performance model for HF radio communications circuits (Stewart F.G, \nundated). Depending on input data it appears in four versions. The version used in this study utilizes \nthe monthly median electron density profiles (Haydon and Lucas., 1968) at the mid-point of the \nradio link derived from CCIR foF2 and M(3000)F2 coefficients (CCIR, 1966) and, from these, \nprovides for a given oblique transmission frequency and hour, predictions of the main propagation \nparameters characterizing a given radio link such as elevation angle, TOF, virtual height, etc.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 Data analysis \n \nSystematic observations of parameters TOF and AOA (azimuthal angle of arrival) were performed \nfrom November 2006 to January 2008 over the radio link between Uppsala (Tx: 59.9\u00b0 N, 17.6\u00b0 E) \nand Bruntingthorpe (Rx: 52.5\u00b0 N, 1.1\u00b0 W) every 2 minutes at 6 frequencies (4.637 MHz, 6.954 \nMHz, 8.008 MHz, 10.391 MHz, 11.118 MHz, and 14.364 MHz). The individual observations of \nTOF have a resolution of 0.1 ms. although the transmitted pulse itself is actually wider than this \n(80% of the power is contained within ~0.5ms). Since we are looking for the peak, an individual \ndetermination has an error of approx. \u00b1 0.05ms since even after propagation the modes are fairly \nsymmetric. The TOF is calibrated by determining the median TOF of sporadic-E modes over a one \nyear period of measurements and comparing this to the value returned by VOACAP (a free \nprofessional HF propagation prediction program, available for download from: \nhttp:\/\/www.voacap.com\/). Some example observations are presented in figures 2-3. \nA preliminary analysis was carried out in order to detect the TOF values associated with off great \ncircle propagation. The AOA measurements were used as a filter to determine whether the signal \nhas travelled via a conventional propagation modes, i.e. along the great circle path, or by another \nmechanism (e.g. deviations due to scattering from irregularities in the auroral oval, Siddle et al. \n2004a,b) that results in the signal being displaced significantly from the great circle direction. With \nthis in mind, as the azimuth angle between Uppsala and Bruntingthorpe is approximately 47\u00b0, all \nTOF measurements corresponding to AOA measurements which values differed significantly from \n47\u00b0, ( i.e. from 47\u00b0 \u00b1 1.5\u00b0), were disregarded. In such a way, TOF measurements associated with off \ngreat circle propagation modes, interfering signals, or with an array side lobe have been excluded \nfrom the analysis and only TOF measurements related to conventional propagation modes selected. \nMoreover such measurements were \u201ccleaned up\u201d from the calibration offset (2.7\u00b10.1 ms) due to the \ntime it takes for the signal to pass through the filters in the transmitter and receiver. Subsequently \nTOF measurements associated with conventional one hop propagation modes around each hour (hr) \nwere taken into account to extract TOF measurements for 1E (TOF1E, hr) and 1F (TOF1F, hr) \npropagation modes at a given hour. From TOF1E, hr and TOF1F, hr  data, TOF median measurements \nfor 1E (TOF1E, hr, med) and 1F (TOF1F, hr, med) propagation modes were calculated for each hour, \nmonth and frequency. \n \n4 Results   \n \nA few comparisons between TOF monthly median measurements and TOF monthly median \npredictions provided by IRI-95, SIRM&BR_D and ICEPAC are shown in figures 4-6 for different \nseasons and frequencies for the one hop propagation modes 1E and 1F. \n \nTables 1-2 summarize the performances of the three different methods that approximate ray tracing \nin terms of r.m.s. difference between TOF monthly median measurements and TOF monthly median \npredictions over the whole day. \nTo put better in evidence how important are the TOF prediction errors, the lengths of the median \nand predicted ray paths, and their differences (DP),  have been calculated for all the hours and for \nall the frequencies. The minimum and maximum DP values are shown for 1E and 1F propagation \nmodes in tables 3-4 respectively. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Discussion of the results  \n \nTaking into account all the signals at frequencies that arrive at the receiver via 1E on great circle \npropagation modes, in winter months (November 2006 to February 2007), equinoctial months \n(March 2007 and April 2007) and summer months (May 2007 to August 2007) the comparisons \nbetween IRI-95 and SIRM&BR_D do not show significant differences in terms of r.m.s. deviation \nAs expected, both the models are able to predict the TOF of 1E on great circle propagation modes \nduring daylight hours. The behaviour of ICEPAC is different because it is also able to predict TOF \nof 1Es propagation modes both during the night time and day time. ICEPAC\u2019s performance in \ngeneral is better than that provided by the IRI-95 and SIRM&BR_D models as shown in figure 4, \nbut some exceptions are present. In particular the performance of ICEPAC shows a remarkable \nimprovement compared with the performance provided by IRI-95 and SIRM&BR_D when the \nsporadic E layer is present as shown in figures 5-6. As can be noted from the results presented in \ntables 1-4 and figures 4-6,  IRI-95, SIRM&BR_D, and ICEPAC give better predictions when 1E \npropagation modes are considered.  \nFor 1E propagation modes,  the comparisons among the three predictions methods in table 3 show \nthat the best performance is provided by ICEPAC (DPmax < 20 km), especially during winter \nmonths. IRI-95 and SIRM&BR_D provide the best performance during summer months while \ndoes not emerge a significant seasonal difference during winter and equinoctial months (DPmax > 20 \nkm). Therefore, under these circumstances the prediction methods are not able to approximate \naccurately the median ray path for 1E propagation modes given that DP values up to around  30 km \nare possible (table 3). \nTherefore IRI-95, SIRM&BR_D, and ICEPAC could be used under ionospheric \u201cquiet\u201d \nconditions, only to provide a rough estimate of the radio propagation path parameters during \ndaylight hours. \n \nTaking into account all the signals at frequencies that arrive at the receiver via 1F on great circle \npropagation modes the results provided by the three methods are not satisfactory as can be seen in \ntable 2 and 4. A visual review of all the results, reveals that the best performances are given by \nICEPAC in January 2007 but only in a few cases  (r.m.s. = 0.034 ms for frequency = 10.391 MHz; \nr.m.s. = 0.025 ms for frequency = 11.118 MHz; r.m.s. = 0.038 ms for frequency = 14.360 MHz).  \nFor 1F propagation modes, the comparisons in table 4 show that the performance is very bad for \neach prediction method and season. In fact, except for a very few cases DPmin > 20 km and  DPmax > \n50 km. DP values of some tens of kilometres (table 4), point out that the predicted ray path is very \ndifferent from the median ray path. This means that the methods IRI-95, SIRM&BR_D, and \nICEPAC, applied to approximate ray tracing technique, fail completely in providing reliable TOF,  \nfob , P,  h, and \uf044  predictions under \u201cquiet\u201d ionospheric conditions when 1F propagation modes are \nconsidered. \n \n6 Conclusions \n \nWhen a radio signal reflects from the E region, the oblique ray path is affected by the ionosphere \nfor a relatively short time, consequently the model assuming that ionospheric reflection takes place \nfrom a simple horizontal mirror is a good approximation. This probably explains why IRI-95 and \nSIRM&BR_D can provide under \u201cquiet\u201d ionospheric conditions only a rough estimate of the radio \npropagation path parameters concerning the 1E on great circle propagation modes. When the \npropagation is via the F region, the ionospheric plasma affects the oblique ray path for a longer \ntime, and consequently the model adopted is not a good approximation. In this case the prediction \nmethods investigated here fail and a precise estimate of the time delay and of all the other radio \npropagation path parameters related to it cannot be provided also in the case of \u201cquiet\u201d ionosphere.  \nThis happens because we have tried to characterize the HF ionospheric channel in a very simple \nway, assuming a geometry based on ionospheric reflections taking place from an horizontal mirror, \nand using a modelled electron density profile N = N(h) only in the middle point of the radio link, \nwhile accurate electron density profiles at all points along the whole path between the transmitter \nand receiver should be considered for describing with a good accuracy the HF communication link. \n \nAt least for the particular radio-link analysed, the results obtained in this work show that, in spite of \nthe relative speed of application of the three prediction methods (no ray tracing is required), it is \nnecessary to adopt a different procedure that is able to include a more appropriate knowledge of the \nionospheric conditions. Therefore only a ray tracing technique, either analytical or numerical, could \nbe expected to provide better predictions. The future developments that could improve the \npredictions are the following: \n \n1. A ray tracing technique with magnetic field, coupled with modelled monthly median electron \ndensity profiles in a 2D - 3D ionosphere, could provide large improvements. \n \n2. Elevation angle measurements (EA) collected during the same period (November 2006 to \nAugust 2007) and over the same radio link, could be used in conjunction with AOA \nmeasurements to conduct a preliminary analysis deeper than the one described in Section 2. \n \nStudies concerning the observed spread in elevation angle versus the observed spread in azimuth \nangle could be very useful to determine the on great circle propagation modes and to better \ndistinguish both the different propagation modes and the oblique ray paths affected by the presence \nof tilts.  \n \n \nHowever, it must be pointed out that these results can not be considered definitive, but only \npreliminary because they have been obtained just from one particular radio-path. In fact, a \nsystematic study should be carried out taking into account EA, AOA, and TOF measurements over \nmany other radio links located at lower latitudes to draw the final conclusions.  \n  \nFinally, as regards real time HF applications, as for example in the real-time frequency management \nof OTH (over-the-horizon) radar systems, new studies could be carried out to develop a 3D monthly \nmedian ionospheric model updated, as much as possible, by real-time measurements coming from a \nnetwork of appropriately located ionosondes. In such a way, a 3D real time ionospheric model, \ntaking into account day-to-day ionospheric variability, coupled with a ray tracing technique could \nconstitute a software package able to provide reliable real time predictions of radio propagation \nparameters. In such case, real time TOF measurements could be directly compared with TOF \npredicted to test the \u201cgoodness\u201d of the predictions. Obviously, these studies constitute a very \ndifferent work from that described in this paper. They could be a very interesting work to carry out \nin future.   \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank  the unknown referees for their useful comments and suggestions \nthat contributed to improving the paper. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 References \n \n \nBilitza, D.
