Introduction\nAs its alternative name suggests, the Gaussian probability distribution is commonly11\nassumed to be the \u201cnormal\u201d distribution for most types of fluctuations, due to it being12\nthe attractor distribution for sums of many independent random variables. However, in13\nmany cases in the human and natural world, it is leptokurtic (fatter than Gaussian) and14\nheavy-tailed (fatter than exponential) probability distributions that are ubiquitous. The15\nimportance of these distributions lies in the high likelihood of large \u2018wild\u2019 fluctuations16\nrelative to a Gaussian distribution with the same variance. Or, equivalently, more of17\nthe variance is due to rare large deviations rather than frequent smaller deviations. Not18\nhaving a full understanding of the distribution of fluctuations of a particular quantity,19\nand just assuming that those fluctuations are normally distributed, can lead to highly20\nflawed conclusions, such as an inadequate assessment of risk in financial models with dis-21\nastrous consequences [Mandelbrot and Hudson, 2004]. Similar issues arise in the natural22\nsciences where sometimes only the average values of certain quantities are known or used23\nand the distributions of fluctuations are not considered, or assumed normal, leading to24\nflawed results or conclusions [e.g., Golovchanskaya, 2008]. Furthermore, knowledge of the25\nprobability distribution of fluctuations can provide insight into the underlying dynam-26\nical processes, expressed by the Langevin equation corresponding to the Fokker-Planck27\nsolution [e.g., Hnat et al., 2005].28\nIn this paper, we compile the probability density function (PDF) of ionospheric vorticity29\nmeasurements and investigate how the form of the PDF varies with spatial location within30\nthe polar ionosphere. We also fit a series of model distributions to the PDFs using31\nD R A F T May 18, 2010, 12:14pm D R A F T\nX - 4 CHISHAM AND FREEMAN: IONOSPHERIC VORTICITY DISTRIBUTIONS\nmaximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) analysis and attempt to identify the best model32\nthat describes the observed distribution of vorticity. We interpret the model and its spatial33\nvariation in terms of the underlying magnetohydrodynamic processes. We conclude by34\nproposing that a similar approach should be used for future studies of magnetic field-35\naligned current (FAC) fluctuations.36\n2. Method\nThe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) [Greenwald et al., 1995;37\nChisham et al., 2007] is a network of coherent scatter radars designed to measure large38\nand meso-scale plasma flow in the Northern and Southern polar ionospheres. For this39\nstudy we have used measurements from the Prince George\/Kodiak SuperDARN radar40\npair in North America, during the years 2000 to 2005 inclusive. Measurements of mag-41\nnetic field-aligned vorticity within the overlapping field of view of the two radars are42\ndetermined according to Stokes\u2019 theorem by measuring the ionospheric plasma velocity43\naround closed loops defined by the geometry of the overlapping radar beams [Chisham et44\nal., 2009]. Various loops may be constructed on differing scales. Here we use those on the45\nsmallest measurement scale which corresponds to closed loop areas ranging from \u223c 500046\nkm2 closest to the radars to \u223c 50000 km2 at the farthest overlapping ranges. Our analysis47\nresulted in \u223c6.2 million independent vorticity measurements during the 6-year interval48\nover a wide range of altitude-adjusted corrected geomagnetic (AACGM) latitudes (\u223c66\u25e6-49\n85\u25e6) and the complete 24 hours of magnetic local time (MLT). In this paper, a positive50\n(negative) field-aligned vorticity represents a clockwise (counter-clockwise) rotation when51\nlooking down the magnetic field into the Northern Hemisphere ionosphere.52\nD R A F T May 18, 2010, 12:14pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM AND FREEMAN: IONOSPHERIC VORTICITY DISTRIBUTIONS X - 5\nWe compare the probability distribution of measured vorticity \u03c9 at different locations53\nwith three candidate heavy-tailed model distributions:54\n(1) The exponential probability density function (PDF)\nf1(\u03c9) = \u03bbe\n\u2212\u03bb\u03c9 (1)\n(2) The Weibull PDF (corresponding to a stretched exponential cumulative density\nfunction)\nf2(\u03c9) =\nc\n\u03c7\n(\n\u03c9\n\u03c7\n)c\u22121\nexp\n[\n\u2212\n(\n\u03c9\n\u03c7\n)c]\n(2)\nwhere the function tends to an exponential as c tends to 1.55\n(3) The q-exponential PDF\nf3(\u03c9) =\n1\n\u03ba\n(\n1\u2212 (1\u2212 q)\u03c9\n\u03ba\n)q\/(1\u2212q)\n(3)\nwhere the function tends to an exponential as q tends to 1. (This is the form as given in56\nShalizi et al.[2007] - the function is also written in an alternative form with q\u2032 = 1\/(2\u2212q)).57\nThe parameters of each model distribution are estimated using maximum likelihood58\n(ML). Specifically the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) have been determined from59\nan analytical or numerical solution of the stationary points of the log likelihood function60\n[Edwards et al., 2007; Qiao and Tsokos, 1994; Sornette, 2003; Shalizi et al., 2007]. In this61\nprocess, we consider the negative and positive vorticities as separate distributions because62\nthe PDFs for the different polarities appear distinctly different. Hence, we have two vor-63\nticity data sets, \u03c9+ = {\u03c91, \u03c92, \u03c93, ..., \u03c9n+} for \u03c9i > 0, and \u03c9\u2212 = {|\u03c91|, |\u03c92|, |\u03c93|, ..., |\u03c9n\u2212|}64\nfor \u03c9i < 0.65\nD R A F T May 18, 2010, 12:14pm D R A F T\nX - 6 CHISHAM AND FREEMAN: IONOSPHERIC VORTICITY DISTRIBUTIONS\nFinally, we discriminate between the different models using the Akaike weights system\n[Burnham and Anderson, 2002], which is a statistical method for comparing the likelihood\nof two or more model fits to a data set. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [Akaike,\n1973] for a model i (i = 1, 2, 3 here) is\nAICi = \u22122 log\n[\nLi\n(\n\u03b8\u02c6i|\u03c9\n)]\n+ 2Ki (4)\nwhere L is the likelihood function, where \u03b8\u02c61 = \u03bb\u02c6, \u03b8\u02c62 = (c\u02c6, \u03c7\u02c6), and \u03b8\u02c63 = (q\u02c6, \u03ba\u02c6) for our\nthree model distributions, and where Ki is the number of parameters being estimated for\nmodel i. The most likely model is the one with the minimum AIC, termed AICmin. The\nAkaike weights are the relative likelihoods of each model, given by\nWi =\ne\u2212\u0394i\/2\u22113\nj=1 e\n\u2212\u0394j\/2 (5)\nwhere \u0394i = AICi \u2212 AICmin. Hence, the maximum weight is given to the model with66\nminimum AIC, for which \u0394i = 0. The weights are normalised so that they sum to 1. The67\nweight Wi is considered to be the weight of evidence in favour of model i being the best68\nmodel for the given data, out of the models considered.69\n3. Results\nFigure 1a presents the PDF of all measured vorticity values (grey-shaded histogram), on70\nlog-linear axes, with a vorticity bin size of 0.5 mHz. The PDF is distinctly not Gaussian,71\nwhich would be an inverse parabola on a log-linear plot. Instead it is heavy tailed,72\ni.e., fatter than exponential, which would be a straight line. The maximum likelihood73\nexponential PDFs, for positive and negative vorticity separately, are shown by the green74\nlines and can be seen to underestimate the tails of the distribution. Weibull PDFs (blue75\nD R A F T May 18, 2010, 12:14pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM AND FREEMAN: IONOSPHERIC VORTICITY DISTRIBUTIONS X - 7\ncurves) appear to provide better fits than the exponential distribution but still do not76\naccurately describe the tails of the distribution. Q-exponentials (red lines) appear to77\nprovide the best fit to the data of the three chosen functions. Indeed the corresponding78\nAkaike weights of the three models are Wi = {\u223c 0,\u223c 0,\u223c 1} for both the positive and79\nnegative vorticity distributions, confirming that the q-exponential (model 3) is the most80\nlikely model out of the three models that we have selected. The high degree of certainty81\nin the model selection (giving weights of effectively 1 and 0) is due to the large number82\nof data points involved in the MLE analysis. That is, the more data we have, the easier83\nit is to clearly distinguish between different models.84\nEven so, it is evident that the q-exponential may still not fully describe the vorticity85\ndistribution. One reason may be that it combines observations from all available AACGM86\nlatitudes and MLTs, whereas there are significant spatial variations in average vorticity87\nwith latitude and MLT [Chisham et al., 2009] and hence there must similarly be spatial88\nvariations in the vorticity PDF. To investigate this we present, in figures 1b-1d, three89\nvorticity PDFs (grey shaded histograms) compiled using vorticity data from three different90\nspatial regions: (b) 67\u25e6-70\u25e6 AACGM latitude, 1800-2100 MLT (typical of the auroral91\nzone), (c) 72\u25e6-75\u25e6 AACGM latitude, 1200-1500 MLT (typical of the cusp), (d) 75\u25e6-78\u25e692\nAACGM latitude, 0600-0900 MLT (typical of the polar cap).93\nAs before, we fit our three model distributions to each of the measured vorticity PDFs94\nusing maximum likelihood estimates, and then select the most likely of the three models95\nin each case using Akaike weights. In figure 1b, the PDF is more leptokurtic than that96\nshown in figure 1a, but the Akaike weights analysis again suggests that the q-exponential97\nD R A F T May 18, 2010, 12:14pm D R A F T\nX - 8 CHISHAM AND FREEMAN: IONOSPHERIC VORTICITY DISTRIBUTIONS\n(red curve) is the best fit to the PDF with W+i = W\u2212i = {\u223c 0,\u223c 0,\u223c 1}. For figure 1c,98\nthe three model curves for positive vorticity are extremely similar, and all fit the PDF99\nwell, suggesting that the PDF is close to being exponential. The Akaike weights suggest100\nthat all three models are viable, with W+i = {0.14, 0.11, 0.75}, but with the q-exponential101\n(model 3) being the most likely. For the negative vorticity curve in figure 1c the Akaike102\nweights (W\u2212i = {\u223c 0,\u223c 1,\u223c 0}) support the Weibull fit (blue curve), highlighting that103\nthe q-exponential curve does not always provide the most likely fit to the vorticity PDF104\nat all locations. The vorticity PDF presented in figure 1d is highly asymmetric, with the105\npositive (negative) vorticity PDF being more (less) leptokurtic than the exponential curve.106\nThe Akaike weights analysis results in W+i = {\u223c 0,\u223c 0,\u223c 1} and W\u2212i = {\u223c 0,\u223c 1,\u223c 0}107\nimplying that the q-exponential fits best to the positive vorticity PDF and the Weibull108\nfits best to the negative vorticity PDF.109\nIn summary, these three PDFs highlight the following: (1) The PDFs in different spatial110\nregions have different forms, with some being more leptokurtic than others. (2) Some of111\nthe PDFs are highly asymmetric around zero vorticity (justifying our decision to treat the112\npositive and negative vorticity distributions separately). (3) The overall vorticity PDF113\npresented in figure 1a is a conglomeration of a number of different vorticity PDFs that114\ncharacterise different regions.115\nGiven this, we have investigated how the model varies across the whole polar ionosphere116\nby dividing the northern polar ionosphere into regions of 1-hr of MLT by 2\u25e6 of AACGM117\nlatitude and then performing the MLE and Akaike weights analysis on the vorticity data118\nin each region. In figure 2 we present maps which illustrate the spatial variation of the119\nD R A F T May 18, 2010, 12:14pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM AND FREEMAN: IONOSPHERIC VORTICITY DISTRIBUTIONS X - 9\nAkaike weights for the three different models for both positive and negative vorticity. The120\ndarkest brown indicates regions where the weight is \u223c1, and the lightest brown indicates121\nregions where the weight is\u223c0. For both polarities of vorticity the exponential distribution122\nis characterised by low Akaike weights across the majority of the polar ionosphere. The123\nq-exponential distribution is the most likely model for the PDF across most of the polar124\nionosphere, except for a region in the afternoon sector ionosphere extending from \u223c69\u25e6-125\n79\u25e6AACGM latitude, and from \u223c1000-1700 MLT, for positive vorticity, and a similar126\nregion extending from \u223c0400-1400 MLT for negative vorticity. In both these regions the127\nWeibull is generally the most likely model. (There are other, much smaller, regions where128\nthe q-exponential is not the most likely model but here we focus on the gross features of129\nthe maps).130\n4. Discussion\nWe have found that the PDF of ionospheric vorticity is generally of q-exponential or131\nWeibull form, depending on location. In particular, the Weibull regions match closely132\nto the dayside part of the region 1 field-aligned current (FAC) region where the average133\nvorticity has the largest values for each polarity [Chisham et al., 2009]. This suggests that134\nionospheric vorticity is generated by different physical mechanisms in different regions of135\nthe magnetosphere. A complete physical theory is beyond the scope of this paper but136\nhere we outline an explanation.137\nConsider a magnetohydrodynamic fluid of density \u03c1 and velocity v = E \u00d7 B\/B2 in138\nan electric field E and magnetic field B. Then combining the single fluid momentum139\nD R A F T May 18, 2010, 12:14pm D R A F T\nX - 10 CHISHAM AND FREEMAN: IONOSPHERIC VORTICITY DISTRIBUTIONS\nequation and the generalised Ohm\u2019s law and taking the curl, we find that the vorticity140\n\u03c9 = \u2207\u00d7 v is given by the classic baroclinic vorticity equation141\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u2202t\n= \u2207\u00d7 (v \u00d7 \u03c9) + \u2207\u03c1\u00d7\u2207p\n\u03c12\n(6)\nwhere p is the ion pressure.142\nNow separating velocity v into a deterministic part and a stochastic part corresponding143\nto unresolved or otherwise unrepresented processes, we find that the vorticity equation144\ncan be written in the form of a general Langevin equation145\nd\u03c9t = f(\u03c9) + g(\u03c9)\u03be(t) + \u03b7(t) + h (7)\nwhere \u03be and \u03b7 are independent Gaussian white noises representing the unrepresented146\nprocesses, and h is a constant. Here the multiplicative noise term (g(\u03c9)\u03be(t)) corresponds147\nto the convective (first) term on the right-hand side of the vorticity equation (6) and the148\nadditive noise term (\u03b7(t)) corresponds to the baroclinic (second) term.149\nIn the general case where both terms are important, the q-exponential is a stationary150\nsolution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, assuming g(\u03c9) to be of power law151\nform and f to be constant [e.g., Anteneodo and Tsallis, 2003]. An example of this would152\nbe in the region 2 current region where the plasma pressure gradient is expected to be153\nsignificant [e.g., Southwood, 1977]. However in the absence of the baroclinic additive noise154\nterm, a Weibull solution of the stationary Fokker-Planck equation is instead possible,155\nassuming g and f to have the same power law dependency. This could be expected in156\nthe region 1 current region where the plasma pressure is less important. Thus the general157\nD R A F T May 18, 2010, 12:14pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM AND FREEMAN: IONOSPHERIC VORTICITY DISTRIBUTIONS X - 11\nmorphology of ionospheric vorticity is explained by the relative importance of convective158\nand baroclinic effects. A more detailed derivation and analysis will be presented elsewhere.159\nIt is interesting to note that similar arguments might apply to FACs, which are closely160\nassociated with vorticity [e.g., Southwood and Kivelson, 1991]. Thus we might expect161\ntheir distributions to be of similar heavy-tailed form. Indeed, a long-tailed distribution162\nof \u2018intense kilometre-scale\u2019 FAC densities has been reported [Rother et al., 2007] but this163\nwas of peak currents in an \u2018event\u2019, not of all FAC measurements, and no attempt was164\nmade to model the distribution or even to assess whether it was leptokurtic or heavy-165\ntailed. Nevertheless, extreme FAC densities of order 1 mA m\u22122 were measured, which166\ngreatly exceeded typical large-scale average current densities of order 1\u03bcA m\u22122. This167\nmotivates closer examination and identification of the FAC distribution and its variation168\nwith measurement scale, which we will do in a future study. In general, having a model169\nfor the PDF allows us to estimate the likelihood of extreme events, even beyond those170\nalready observed. This may have application in assessing natural hazards to satellites,171\nsuch as single event upsets from particle acceleration caused by extreme FACs.172\n5. Summary\nDistributions of ionospheric vorticity, as measured by the SuperDARN radars, are dis-173\ntinctly non-Gaussian with typically heavy tails. The PDFs in different regions of the174\nionosphere are well approximated by either q-exponential or Weibull probability density175\nfunctions. Weibull PDFs appear to fit best in the dayside region 1 field-aligned current176\nregion whereas q-exponential PDFs appear to fit best elsewhere. These distributions can177\nbe explained by the relative importance of different physical mechanisms for generating178\nD R A F T May 18, 2010, 12:14pm D R A F T\nX - 12 CHISHAM AND FREEMAN: IONOSPHERIC VORTICITY DISTRIBUTIONS\nvorticity in the different regions. Such knowledge will allow us to estimate the proba-179\nbility of observing extreme values of vorticity, and likely also of FAC, and also to assess180\nassociated natural hazards.181\nAcknowledgments.
