These struts can\nbear mechanical loads by either stretching or bending.\nInterestingly, some materials appear to macroscopically\ndeform primarily through the local stretching of the struts,\nwhile in other materials the elastic energy is stored via\nlocal bending. Furthermore, a transition between these two\nregimes has been reported. Wilhelm and Frey (2003) and\nHead et al. (2003) simulated the two-dimensional elastic\ndeformation of a network of rods [8\u201310]. A transition from\na system where the macroscopic elasticity was dominated\nby the bending stiffness of the struts, to where the stretch-\ning stiffness dominated, was observed with increasing rod\ndensity. Head et al. (2003) characterized this transition as\nbeing from a system with a nonuniform strain field (non-\naffine) to a system with a uniform strain field (affine)\n[9,10]. Onck et al. (2005) have also observed such a tran-\nsition for systems under very large deformations, where the\nstruts align in the tensile direction [11]. Furthermore,\nexperimental studies have also observed this transition\nand, in particular, Liu et al. have directly imaged the strain\nfield in semiflexible polymer networks and observed less\naffinely deformed networks in the bending regime [12].\nElucidating this transition is not only of interest to mate-\nrials scientists but is also vital to our understanding of\nvarious biological systems, from cellular structures, such\nas wood and trabecular bone [1], to actin and cytoskeletal\nnetworks [5]. The purpose of the Letter, therefore, is to\npresent our computational study of the elasticity of ran-\ndomly generated three-dimensional lattice structures and\nto quantify the geometry dependence of the bending-to-\nstretching transition. Whereas previous studies have inves-\ntigated this transition in terms of the density of overlapping\nrods in two-dimensional systems, here we characterize this\ntransition as a function of three-dimensional lattice con-\nnectivity. In particular, we present the elastic moduli as a\nfunction of the concentration of struts and describe the\naffinity of these deformations, in order to facilitate com-\nparisons with experimental studies.\nWe use a bond-bending lattice spring model (LSM) to\ncapture the deformation of random networks of intercon-\nnected struts. In particular, the LSM consists of lattice sites\nconnected by one-dimensional harmonic interactions. The\nLSM is traditionally considered to consist of a regular\nlattice and is adopted from condensed matter theory [13]\nand molecular simulations [14]. The regular LSM has been\nshown to capture linear elasticity theory [15,16] and simu-\nlate material heterogeneity [16\u201324]. Furthermore, Ladd\net al. [25,26] have used a regular LSM to capture the\ndeformation of trabecular bone. In contrast, in the present\nwork we assume that each strut can be captured using a\nsimple harmonic interaction and define the compressive or\nstretching and bending force constants as kk \u0001 EsA=l and\nk? \u0001 12EsI=l3, respectively. The force constants depend\non Es, the material Young\u2019s modulus, A, the cross-sectional\narea (\u0001r2), I, the area moment of inertia of the struts\n(\u0001r4=4), and l, the length of the strut. We take Es to be\nunity and the radius of the rods, r, to be 0.1 in dimension-\nless units. This allows us to capture the micromechanics of\nlarge systems.\nThe elastic energy of a Born LSM can be written in\nmatrix form as [16] Ai \u0001 12\nP\nijuij \u0002Mij \u0002 uij, where Ai is\nthe elastic energy stored at node i, the summation is over\nneighboring nodes, uij is the difference in nodal displace-\nments (i.e., ui \u0003 uj), and Mij is a matrix of elastic con-\nstants. For a strut in the [100] direction the force constants\ncan be chosen to mimic the tensile and bending rigidity of a\ncylindrical strut, resulting in a matrix of the form\n M \u0004100\u0005 \u0001\nkk 0 0\n0 k? 0\n0 0 k?\n0\n@\n1\nA: (1)\nWe can use this matrix to obtain the matrix of force\nconstants for struts of any orientation through appropriate\nrotational transformations [16]. By minimizing the energy\nof this linear system of equations and balancing the forces\nat nodal points, we can equilibrate an irregular lattice of\nsuch struts and obtain macroscopic elastic constants.\nPRL 98, 238103 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending8 JUNE 2007\n0031-9007=07=98(23)=238103(4) 238103-1 \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society\nWe construct our three-dimensional networks by first\nrandomly distributing LSM nodes throughout the system.\nWe then connect neighboring nodes by struts. In particular,\nnodes within a given distance are connected and this\ndistance is chosen in order to maintain an average con-\nnectivity in the lattice. Struts which would be connected in\nthe x direction, in the presence of periodic boundary con-\nditions, are redefined as boundary struts and used to con-\nnect the LSM lattice with the system boundaries. Free\nboundary conditions are applied in the y and z directions.\nIt should be noted that the system described here focuses\nonly on mechanical deformations while it has been re-\nported that thermal fluctuations can also play a role in\nsemiflexible polymer networks [27]. The effects of these\nthermal fluctuations are believed to increase the effective\ncompliance of the struts as the applied deformation has to\nfirst pull out thermal fluctuations before stretching the\npolymer backbone.\nA rigid percolation transition has been observed in dis-\nordered networks. For very low densities the struts have\nbeen found to be isolated, or in small clusters, and macro-\nscopically the network does not percolate [9]; a similar\nrigidity percolation has been found by Hough et al. [28] in\ncarbon nanotube suspensions. In our simulations we find\nthat for systems with an average connectivity of three or\nless the material does not resist small deformations. As we\nincrease the connectivity, however, the lattice forms a\npercolating pathway of rigid material and the material is\nmacroscopically capable of bearing applied loads.\nFigure 1 shows two lattices of different connectivity and\nunder different deformations. Figures 1(a) and 1(c) depict\nsystems with a low density of nodes, but high connectivity\n(on average 15) and Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) depict systems with\na high density of nodes, but low connectivity (on average\n5); the concentration of struts, however, is roughly 0.06 in\nall systems. Despite the similarity in concentration, the\ngeometry of the systems are clearly different. Arrows\nindicate the direction of applied deformation (either shear\nor normal). The system boundaries (whose displacement\ndrives the deformation) are depicted as gray walls, and the\nstruts are colored from white (relatively undeformed) to\nred (high stretching energy) or blue (high bending energy).\nIt can, therefore, be seen that the systems with higher and\nlower connectivity deform primarily through the stretching\nand bending of the lattice struts, respectively.\nBending dominated deformation throughout the system\nhas previously been associated with nonaffine strain fields\n[9,10] and a lower density of struts [8,10]. The bending\nregime occurs because the system can deform without the\nstruts having to change length. Rather, the distances be-\ntween lattice nodes remain relatively unchanged and the\nangles between struts varies. The bending rigidity of the\nlattice struts is proportional to the area moment of inertia\n( \/ R4, where R is the radius of the struts), while the\nconcentration is proportional to the cross-sectional area\n(\/R2). From scaling arguments, therefore, the macro-\nscopic rigidity (either Young\u2019s or shear modulus) should\nscale as concentration squared [1].\nIn contrast to the bending regime, the stretching occurs\nbecause the system cannot deform without changing the\nlength of the struts. In particular, such rigidity is thought to\narise from clusters of triangles [29] or, more precisely, a\nnetwork composed of many triangular tessellations. In\nsuch structures, a change in the position of a lattice node\nnecessarily causes changes to the lengths of the neighbor-\ning struts. As the stretching rigidity of the lattice struts is\nproportional to the cross-sectional area, the macroscopic\nrigidity should scale linearly with concentration (which is\nalso proportional to cross-sectional area). From the scaling\narguments of Gibson [1] a change in the exponent (in the\nelastic modulus versus concentration plots) from 2 to 1\nindicates a change from bending-to-stretching dominated\ndeformation.\nFigure 2 shows both the relative shear modulus and\nrelative Young\u2019s modulus as a function of concentration.\nFor each value of connectivity we consider five different\nvalues for the number of lattice nodes (N \u0001 500, 1000,\n2000, 4000, 8000). Furthermore, we equilibrate three in-\ndependent geometries for each connectivity and lattice\nnode specification. The mechanical properties of these\nrandomly generated geometries are displayed in Fig. 2.\nIncreasing the connectivity of the geometry increases the\nnumber of struts and, therefore, the concentration, shear\nmodulus, and Young\u2019s modulus all increase. Furthermore,\nthe gradients of the log-log plots of shear and Young\u2019s\nFIG. 1 (color online). Deformed networks subject to shear (a),\n(b) and normal (c), (d) deformations (arrows indicate direction of\napplied deformation). Both high connectivity (a), (c) and low\nconnectivity (b), (d) systems are shown. Struts are colored white\nif relatively undeformed, blue if the deformation energy of the\nstruts is predominantly bending, and red if the deformation\nenergy is predominantly stretching.\nPRL 98, 238103 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending8 JUNE 2007\n238103-2\nmodulus versus concentration appear to decrease with in-\ncreasing connectivity. Recall that this is expected from\nscaling arguments as systems with high connectivity\nshould deform primarily through stretching.\nWe quantify this transition in Fig. 3. We characterize the\nbending-to-stretching transition using the exponent ob-\ntained from Fig. 2 and the ratio of stretching energy to\ntotal energy. The exponent varies from \u00062 at low connec-\ntivity to \u00061 at high connectivity, in agreement with pre-\ndictions based entirely on scaling arguments. On the\nsecond y axis of Fig. 3 we depict the ratio of elastic energy\ndue entirely to the stretching of the struts with the total\nelastic energy. The ratio between stretching and total en-\nergy does not depend on the concentration, but on the\nmicroscopic connectivity of the network. We, therefore,\naverage this quantity over all the struts, in all systems with\na given connectivity. This ratio is \u00060 for low connectivity\nwhich indicates that most of the elastic energy is stored\nthrough bending deformations. For higher connectivities\nthe ratio approaches 1 indicating that the elastic energy in\nthe deformed system arises from the stretching of the\nstruts.\nFinally, we measure the affinity of the deformation fields\nin these disordered systems. In Fig. 4(a) we plot the relative\ndisplacement (ux=L\u0002, where ux is displacement, L is sys-\ntem length, and \u0002 is applied strain) as a function of initial\nposition for two systems under normal deformation. The\nsolid line depicts a perfectly affine deformation; the high\n(C \u0001 20) and low (C \u0001 4) connectivity systems are repre-\nsented by circles and stars, respectively. While systems of\nlow and high connectivity show disorder, the system with\nlow connectivity exhibits collections of points which pos-\nsess similar displacements for large ranges of initial posi-\ntion [horizontal lines of star points in Fig. 4(a)]. This is due\nto clusters which do not contribute to the percolating\nstructure (and do not, therefore, support stress) but exist\nin a relatively undeformed state attached to the percolating\nstructure. Furthermore, the inset of Fig. 4(a) shows the\ndegree of nonaffinity, defined as R\u0007\u0001r0\b \u0001 h\u0001\u0007\u0001rij \u0003\n\u0001rAij\b=\u0001rAij\u00022i, where \u0001rij is the distance between nodes i\nand j, \u0001rAij is the affine distance, and \u0001r0 is the unper-\nturbed distance. Consistent with earlier work [10,12] the\ndegree of nonaffinity decreases with distance (the defor-\nmations appear more uniform over larger distances). The\nconnectivity appears to affect the affinity of the deforma-\ntion field equally, for all length scales.\nTo quantify the nonaffine nature of the deformations we\nplot the root-mean-square (rms) deviation of simulated\npositions from those of perfectly affine deformations.\nFurthermore, we plot a standard correlation function be-\ntween the displaced and initial positions (for a perfectly\naffine deformation this equals 1). Figure 4(b) shows both\nthe decrease in this rms deviation (solid line) and the\nincrease in the correlation function (dashed line) for sys-\ntems with increasing connectivity. Therefore, consistent\nwith previous studies, we find the bending-to-stretching\ntransition to be accompanied by a change towards more\nuniform deformation fields.\n 1\n 1.2\n 1.4\n 1.6\n 1.8\n 2\n 2.2\n 4  6  8  10  12  14  16  18  20\n 0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 1\nEx\npo\nne\nnt\nA s\ntre\ntc\nh\/A\nto\nta\nl\nConnectivity\nShear (exponent)\nShear (energy)\nYoungs (exponent)\nYoungs (energy)\nFIG. 3 (color online).
