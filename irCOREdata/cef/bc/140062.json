Introduction\nDuring the last decade, UK manufacturing output has remained relatively stable, whereas\nmanufacturing profitability has been declining. There are several explanations for the\nrelatively low level of UK manufacturing profitability, including the emergence of alternative\nlow cost sources of supply. These low cost sources of supply affect every developed\neconomy, not just the UK. The OECD (2007) and Porter and Ketels (2003) reports suggest\nthat manufacturing in developed economies needs to move up the value chain and compete on\nthe basis of value delivered rather than on the basis of cost.\nWestern economies have started to compete on the basis of value delivered by shifting their\nmarket share from manufacturing to more product-service oriented systems (Wise and\nBaumgartner 1999; Neely, 2008). This is linked to the view that manufacturing companies are\nbecoming more oriented to the use of the product-service offering rather than the pure product\n(Manzini, Vezzoli and Clark, 2001; Mont, 2001; Manzini and Vezzoli, 2003). Thereby, many\nmanufacturers have sought growth through the increased sale of services (Wise and\nBaumgartner, 1999, Reinartz and Ulaga, 2008). This journey towards a tightly-coupled\ncombination of products and services is known as servitization (Vandermerwe and Rada,\n1998).\nProduct-based manufacturing and process-based manufacturing have proved to be relatively\neasy to imitate by competitors, whereas product-service systems are less easy to replicate\n(Dickson, 1992; Ghemawat, 1986). This has pushed many manufacturers to recognise the\nstrategic integration of services as a source of sustainable competitive advantage and\ncorporate profitability (Oliva and Kallenberg, 2003; Cohen et al 2006; Rosen et al, 2003; DTI\n2002; Newman and Cowling, 1996; Vandermerwe and Rada, 1988; Chase and Garvin, 1989).\nIn theory, the implementation of product-service systems (PSS) leads to higher revenues and\nmargins, but in practice, it takes time to build corporate profitability up (Gebauer, Fleisch and\nFriedli, 2005, Neely, 2008). The adoption of a new product-service strategy requires\ninvestments on capacity building such as the acquisition of new peoples\u2019 skills, capabilities\nand technologies, etc (Reinartz and Ulaga, 2008). Therefore in the shorter term, it might be\nchallenging for organisations to make huge revenues out of a new PSS transformation; it may\nonly be in the longer term that a new PSS strategy delivers on its promises.\nOrganisations such as IBM, General Electric, Xerox, Canon and Parkersell have had a\nsignificant share of revenues and profits from services since the middle of 1990s; this is\nattributed to a shift from product to service perspective (Quinn, Doorley and Paquette, 1990).\nOliva and Kallenberg (2003), Davies (2003) and Araujo and Spring (2006) argue that during\nthis transformation to a combined product-service offering, organisations are likely to change\ntheir strategies, operations and value chains, technologies, people expertise and system\nintegration capabilities. However, the transformation paths from a product-centric strategy to\na combined product-service strategy are still poorly understood and remain a new and\ncomplex concept (Voss et al, 2005; Johnston, 1995; Miller, et al. 2002; Tukker, 2004). Hence,\nthe purpose of this paper is to present challenges experienced by UK manufacturing\ncompanies undergoing a servitization journey to becoming product-service providers.\n2. Background\nServitization\nMany manufacturers offer services, but may not use services as the basis of their competitive\nstrategy. Servitization is defined as the strategic innovation of an organisation\u2019s capabilities\nand processes to shift from selling products to selling an integrated product and service\n4offering that delivers value in use, i.e. a Product-Service System, (Baines et al., 2007;\nVandermerwe and Rada, 1988). There are various forms of servitization such as the categories\nthat Tukker proposes (2004). They range from products with services as an \u2018add-on\u2019, to\nservices with tangible goods. They tend to be delivered using customer-centric strategies in\norder to provide \u2018desired outcomes\u2019 for the customer. This customer orientation consists of\ntwo distinctive elements (Oliva & Kallenberg, 2003). Firstly, a shift of the service offering\nfrom product-oriented services to \u2018user process oriented services\u2019: i.e. a shift from a focus on\nensuring the proper functioning and\/or customer\u2019s use of the product, to pursuing efficiency\nand effectiveness of the end-user\u2019s processes related to the product). Secondly, a shift of the\nnature of customer interaction from transaction-based to relationship-based: i.e. a shift from\njust selling products to selling complete solutions through long relationships. Servitization\nfrequently occurs as a response to financial difficulties, new customer demands and strategic\nproduct differentiation (Mathieu, 2001a, Oliva and Kallenberg, 2003; Gebauer et al., 2006). It\nhas been observed in successful cases that when organisations gain insight into their\ncustomers\u2019 needs, they are able to develop more tailored offerings (Mathieu, 2001; Malleret,\n2006).\nIn this research, servitization is defined as the journey or transformation process whereby an\norganisation enables its product-service offerings. Figure 1 illustrates the servitization\ncontinuum, which focuses on the analysis of the customer-supplier interface.\nFigure 1. Servitization Continuum: a view of the customer-supplier interface\nDesign Manufacture Delivery Usage Support End-of-Use\nSuppliers Customers\nBroadening of interaction\nfrom transaction to\nrelationship, scope of change,\nthose involved in change\nInteraction mainly transactional;\nsome addition of peripheral services\nProduct + service delivery\nCustomization of product and service\nProducts + service co-designed;\ntotal solutions\nH\nig\nh\nLe\nve\nlo\nfS\ner\nvi\ntiz\nat\nio\nn\nLo\nw\n5Servitization Continuum Criteria\nFour basic criteria assess an organisation\u2019s level of servitization (Table 1). They support the\npositioning of organisations along the servitization continuum (Figure 1). First, the \u2018value\nbasis of activities\u2019 assesses the value identified as the main driver to keep customers coming\nback to the same product-service provider (Gundlach and Murphy, 1993; Lambert, 1996,\nCannon and Perreault, 1999). Second, the \u2018primary role of assets\u2019 gauges the nature of the\nasset\u2019s demand; for instance, asset utilization is focused on the delivery process of the\noffering rather than the tangible asset ownership (Tukker, 2004). Third, the \u2018offering type\u2019\nshows the spectrum of product-service offering; from tangible products supported with a\nperipheral service to total services (Boyer, Hallowell and Roth, 2003). Finally, the\n\u2018production strategy\u2019 indicates the customization level along the servitization continuum\n(Gilmore and Pine II, 1997). Table I shows the criteria and their opposite poles.\nTable I.

They are:\n\uf0b7 Planned processes: deciding upon \u201cwhere we are, where we want to be and how to get\nthere\u201d, followed by implementation and monitoring (Greenwood and Hinings, 1993).\n\uf0b7 Emergent processes: organisations use flexibility to follow incremental changes, in\nadapting to unpredictable challenges (Quinn, 1989; Mintzberg and Walters, 1985;\nTranfield and Smith, 1988; Hatum and Pettigrew, 2004; Lindblom and Olkkonen,\n2006).\n\uf0b7 Reactive processes: generally top-down analytical responses to abrupt stimuli (Senge,\n1994; Chesley and Wenger, 1999; Weick et al.2005; Gersick, 1994; Tushman, 1997).\n\uf0b7 Spontaneous processes: characterised by a proactive \u201cwhole system\u201d change, which is\nunpredictable, uncontrolled, and continuous (Eisenhardt and Brown, 1998; Alvesson,\n2004).\nEach of these has relevance to the product-service transformation processes we have studied\nin the literature.\n6While there is significant literature and theoretical models available in the general field of\nstrategic organisational change, there are no models specific to the issues of servitization as a\nchange process. Although the four schools of change have provided a general understanding\nof the strategies, processes and practices of change, they rarely lay out any specific \u201chow-to\u201d\nand certainly not any indication of the challenges that organisations undergoing servitization\nwill face (Pawar, et al., 2009). This is not unusual in the change management literature, where\ngeneric change \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 are occasionally articulated, typically in the form of\ncommentary upon the change management process and not the change itself \u2013 for example, by\nsuggesting that organisations analyse \u2018where they want to be\u2019. But advice specific to the\ndirect act of change is more uncommon; where this literature does occur is in practitioner\nmagazines and occasionally in specific topics. For example topics such as \u2018supplier\ndevelopment\u2019 change programmes (Rich and Hines, 1997), or implementing Performance\nManagement Systems (Neely et al, 1997); though these are typically informed by subject\nknowledge rather than change management theory. These processes of change inform the\nnature of the challenges we have identified in transforming manufacturing organisations into\nproduct-service providers.\n3. Research Design and Methodology\nResearch Question\nServitization is now widely recognized as an increasingly relevant strategy for western\nmanufacturers to improve their competitive advantage in the market. The existing literature\noffers little guidance on how companies transform from being a \u201cproduct-centred\u201d\norganisation to being a \u201cservitized\u201d organisation. Change literature as we stated provides a\nconsiderable number of theoretical models, but again very little to guide and support\nmanagement on how to transform, especially not in the context of servitization. Thereby, a\nquestion arises: What are the challenges confronted by organisations when transforming\nfrom being a \u201cproduct-centred\u201d to being a \u201cservitized\u201d organisation?\nThe theoretical maturity of change management literature, specifically in the context of\nservitization, can be regarded as nascent. Nascent theories according to Edmondson and\nMcManus (2007:1161) are those that \u201creceived little research of formal theorizing to date or\nelse that represent new phenomena in the world\u201d. In order to achieve a methodological fit\n(Yin, 2003; Edmondson and McManus, 2007) between the state of previous work, research\nmethod, analysis and expected contribution, we adopted an exploratory single case study\napproach (Stake, 1995). Given the theoretical immaturity of research phenomena the adoption\nof a single case study is appropriate as it permits for a deep research enquiry and to come as\nclose to the research phenomena as possible (Dyer and Wilkins, 1991). Questions like\n\u201ctypicality\u201d, \u2018representativeness\u2019 or \u2018atypicality\u2019 of a single case are of secondary importance\n(Buchanan, 1999, p.77). The scope of our research is shown in Figure 2. We used two lenses\nof investigation in order to gain insights about the transformation of a PSS provider: We have\nfirstly investigated (lens 1) a focal company \u2013 a PSS provider \u2013 and secondly the PSS\nprovider\u2019s suppliers (lens 2). The reason for the adoption of the second lens was our\nrealisation during the investigation process that some issues on the transformation path are\nrelated to suppliers\u2019 relationships, therefore the insights from the suppliers\u2019 perspective were\nnot only desirable but necessary for better understanding of the investigated phenomena.\n7Figure 2: Scope of the research\nData Collection Instrument\nThe unit of analysis for the research is a transformation process from a product provider to a\nproduct-service provider within an organisation that designs, builds and delivers integrated\nproduct-service offerings. As a data collection instrument, a semi-structured interview was\ndeveloped through a two-day workshop attended by researchers coming from eight different\ndisciplines, including service marketing, strategic management, supply chain management,\ndesign engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, operations strategy and\ninnovation and change management. The use of researchers from different disciplines allowed\ndifferent avenues of inquiry to be pursued in the data collection (Meredith, 1998). The semi-\nstructured questionnaire focused on determining how and why the company started the\ntransformation to deliver product-service systems, and the challenges this was posing for the\norganisation. For both product-service provider and its suppliers, a series of guiding interview\nquestions were identified, and they typically included questions like:\n\uf0b7 Can you describe your organisation's servitization journey?\n\uf0b7 What stage have you reached?\n\uf0b7 Where are you going?\n\uf0b7 What was most difficult about this servitization journey?\n\uf0b7 What structures, processes, procedures or methods have been used to ensure\ncoherence in organisational response to the product-service system?\nSelection of Case Companies\nThe selection of the case companies was critical for this project, as we sought to investigate a\nmanufacturing company who has a track record of successful provision of product related\nservices. For this reason we have adopted a purposive sampling strategy and selected a UK\nbased OEM that designs and manufactures high value capital equipment for the power,\naerospace and defence sector. For confidentiality reasons and in order to have a greater degree\nof freedom in discussing our findings, we refer to the company as ServPro. ServPro operates\nglobally and today generates over 50% of revenues from the provision of services that are\nclosely coupled to its products. It started the transformation journey in the early 2000s. The\ncompany has made significant progress and is at a relatively advanced stage of servitization\nPSS provider \u2013\n\u2018ServPro\u2019\nSupplier 1 \u2013\n\u2018ServSup-1\u2019\nSupplier 2 \u2013\n\u2018ServSup-2\u2019\nEnd customer \u2013\n\u2018ServCus\u2019\nLens of\ninvestigation 1\nLens of\ninvestigation 2\n8for a traditional manufacturer. This was confirmed by the HR Director who acknowledged\nthat, \u201c\u2026 at the interfaces between the company and the customer I think we\u2019re [now] seeing\nfar more evidence of responsive agile service-centred behaviour\u201d. In the course of the data\ncollection in ServPro it became clear that not only internal challenges impede the\ntransformation process but also those external to a focal organisation. In order to get\nadditional views on external challenges we asked respondents in ServPro to identify two or\nmore suppliers that are of strategic importance in ServPro\u2019s provision of product-service\nsystems. In this way we ensured that selected suppliers played an active part in ServPro\u2019s\ntransformation process. Based on respondents\u2019 feedback two suppliers were identified for\nfurther investigation; ServSup-1, a joint-venture; and ServSup-2, a supplier from the OEM\u2019s\nsupply network.\nData Collection and Analysis\nData were collected between June and November 2007. Interviews were firstly conducted in\nServPro with key personnel from across the organisation (c.f. Design Engineering, Global\nComponent Repair, Service Innovation\/ Marketing, Projects, After-Market Services,\nManufacturing Operations, Customer Services and Supply Chain). Each of the 15 interviews\nlasted between 2 and 3 hours and was recorded and subsequently transcribed. Interviews were\nthen also carried out in supplying organisations. In ServSup-1 and ServSup-2 seven\ninterviews were conducted in total with key managers (c.f. Commercial\/Sales, Customer\nService; Production\/Operations) lasting between 1 and 2 hours each. In addition to primary\ndata collection, the secondary data (company documentation and archival records) were\ncollected as well, in order to achieve a theoretical triangulation (Jick, 1979; Yin, 2003). Each\ninterview was carried out by 2 or 3 cross-discipline researchers. For instance, the customer\nservice or production key personnel were always interviewed by representatives from \u201chard\u201d\n(i.e. engineering, operations) and \u201csoft\u201d (i.e. management) disciplines.\nData were analysed through an inductive research analysis. As Cassel and Symon (1990) and\nHatch (2006) highlight, this analysis is appropriate to develop theory from practice by using\nan interpretive epistemology. The twenty-two interviews yielded more than 400 pages of\ninterview data. An analytical reflection of the data was carried out by the emergent\nidentification of patterns (Cassel and Symon, 1990; Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Yin, 2003). An\nopen coding method - a process of data disaggregation into conceptual categories - was\ncarried out to identify patterns in the data. Codes are, according to Miles and Huberman\n(1994), tags or labels for assigning units of meaning to the descriptive or inferential\ninformation compiled during a study. For the purposes of coding and arranging data we used\nsoftware called Mind Manager\uf0d4. As a result, five categories of servitization challenges\nemerged as the most frequent and critical; they are discussed in the following section. For\neach one of the five emergent categories an explanation-building analysis was performed to\nunderstand the individual meaning of each pattern and their supporting data and quotes\n(Glaser and Strauss, 1967). To strengthen the reliability of the findings, the analyses were\nperformed by the same multidisciplinary team of researchers (Yin, 2003; Miles and\nHuberman, 1994). After the data analysis, the findings of the research team were relayed to\nthe interviewees in a workshop to ensure the correct representation of their views.\n4. Results\nThe emergent patterns suggest five categories of challenges that a company has to consider\nwhen moving from being a product oriented organisation to a product-service oriented\norganisation. These challenges are:\n1) Embedded product-service culture,\n92) Delivery of integrated offering,\n3) Internal processes and capabilities,\n4) Strategic alignment, and\n5) Supplier relationships.\nFigure 3. Architecture of Challenges in Servitization\nEmbedded product-service culture\nEmbedded product-service culture highlights the importance of the product-service culture\nthat traditional manufacturing companies need to embrace and develop into a passion for\nservice, in order to meet customer expectations.\nStrongly embedded traditional manufacturing culture in the organisation is observed to hinder\ntransition towards provision of an integrated offering. An interviewee said\n\u201cCulturally, people still think that at the end it\u2019s still just a big bloody product that comes in\nand gets overhauled.\" (ServPro, DS)\nThe cultural legacy in the company is inhibiting the transition towards a servitized strategy.\nThe organisation needs to embrace the thinking of the end customer.\n\u201cI think it was traditional ... ponderously slow in the way that we did things, I think that the\ndrum beat was set by the research and development programs for the major new product\ntypes. I think \u2026 we look back as often as we look forward, everybody knows we\u2019re very old\nand there is an awful lot on legacy you know\u201d (ServPro, Human Resource Manager).\n\u201cI think if this organisation is ever going to be able to integrate with our customers we\u2019ve just\ngot to talk like a customer does\u201d. (ServPro, Customer Services Manager).\nPeoples\u2019 routines and the way they work differ from organisation to organisation. Provision of\nan integrated offering required changes in the mindsets of ServPro\u2019s employees. This has\nproved to be a difficult challenge. An example on speed of decision making illustrates a\ntypical manufacturing mindset that does not match the requirements of the servitized\nenvironment.\nD\nEL\nIV\nER\nY\nO\nF\nIN\nTE\nG\nR\nA\nTE\nD\nO\nFF\nER\nIN\nG\nIN\nTE\nR\nN\nA\nL\nPR\nO\nC\nES\nSE\nS\n&\nC\nA\nPA\nB\nIL\nIT\nIE\nS\nST\nR\nA\nTE\nG\nIC\nA\nLI\nG\nN\nM\nEN\nT\nSU\nPP\nLI\nER\nR\nEL\nA\nTI\nO\nN\nSH\nIP\nS\nEM\nB\nED\nD\nED\nPR\nO\nD\nU\nC\nT-\nSE\nR\nV\nIC\nE\nC\nU\nLT\nU\nR\nE\nPRODUCT ORIENTED ORGANISATIONS\nPRODUCT-SERVICE\nORIENTED ORGANISATIONS\n10\nThe interviewees highlighted that the cultural challenges described here are rooted in the\nmove from Transaction-based to Relationship-based Value creation (see Table 1).\nRelationship-based value creation increases the number of staff members who interact with\nthe customer and demands that they remain consistent with one another, which our data\nsuggests is not an easy achievement.\nDelivery of integrated offering\nAn integrated offering implies a greater number of customer touch-points, with the result that\na broader range of personnel are being exposed to the customer than previously.\n\u201c\u2026because ... they\u2019re [customer-facing people] doing those jobs but they can\u2019t deliver, all\nthey can do is an acceptance, it\u2019s the rest of the company that has to deliver and if the rest of\nthe company is still sitting believing that we\u2019re an OEM organisation that has months and\nyears to resolve issues and respond to challenges ... then we\u2019ve failed because our\ncompetitors aren\u2019t necessarily having to deal with those issues\u201d (ServPro, HR Manager)\nIntroduction of new types of offering can cause issues in terms of their definition (in\ncontracts, in negotiations, in understanding of what is required).\n\u201c\u2026grey areas in the contract...and the need for a new mind-set to deal with this, rather than\nexploit the opportunity available in having unclear contracts\u201d (ServPro, Customer Services\nManager).\nMisunderstandings may occur on the part of both the provider and the customer, and this may\nlead to an imbalance in expectations.\n\u201c\u2026you have to accept...that they think they are paying for a certain level of service meaning\nthey want a team of people sitting on their doorstep\u201d (ServPro, Services Executive).\nThere may also be a lack of understanding about the synergies between different parts of the\noffering, that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Even to the point of reversing\nlong held logic in negotiations.\n\u201cOne of the issues that we have\u2026 customers think well if I take some of these things out of the\n[name of PSS offering package] offering, my price comes down, that\u2019s evident so if I can take\nthat out, if I don\u2019t have the logistics part and take that out, I don\u2019t want that bit and that bit\nthen surely my cost will come down but it\u2019s actually the opposite is true in my view, we may\nhave these things like controlling of assets but actually they are the things that enable the cost\nto be that low, you start to take that out and the price should start going up and we need all\nthose levers to allow us to deliver\u201d (ServPro, Repair Engineering Manager).\nThere is a tendency in the organisation to revert to a focus on product, rather than the whole\nintegrated offering (particularly when under stress).\n\u201cWe are now a global company and we are going through huge growing pains, I mean\nabsolutely enormous growing pains, we are struggling, our supply chains are struggling and\nfocus goes on the sexy new products\u201d (ServPro, Repair Engineering Manager).\n\u201cNormally a new service is actually adding onto an existing product design\u201d (ServPro,\nOperations Centre Manager).\nInternal processes and capabilities\nThe adoption of product-service strategy requires, among others, acquisition of new\ncapabilities that enable the organisation to compete in new service spaces.\n11\nInternal processes in ServPro do not enable joint design of an integrated offering. Alignment\nof processes that are supporting design and changes of product and service is necessary for\neffective provision of an integrated offering.\n\u201cGuys that do product change are not involved at all in service change, so guess why we\ndecided service has to be aligned very much along the process and product change\u201d.\n(ServPro, Operations Centre Manager)\nMetrics which were designed for a \u201cproduct-centred\u201d organisation require re-alignment when\norganisations transform towards provision of an integrated offering.\n\u201cThe metrics in the individual functionalities that make up ServPro aren\u2019t really aligned...\n...you don\u2019t see how that\u2019s aligned through the metric to actually deal with the integrated\noffering\u201d. (ServPro, Supply Chain Manager)\n\u201cWe operate too much in silos and our metrics are based on how we service one side against\nthe other without recognition for how we are all collectively serving the end customer\u201d.\n(ServPro, Project Manager).\nThe metrics by which performance or processes are measured are becoming aligned across\norganisations; this is assisted by common language and knowledge sharing.\n\u201c\u2026it does go back to a fundamental issue that \u2026 the organisations have got everybody\naligned by one set of critical measures here, we can do lots of other stuff, everybody has to be\ntalking this language\u201d (ServPro, Service Operations Director).\nIn the process of transforming towards provision of an integrated offering it has become clear\nthat without specific infrastructure an organisation will not be able to deliver what has been\npromised to the end customer.\n\u201cAt that point it became very clear that we did not have the infrastructure in place to provide\nthe support we contracted\u201d. (ServPro, Customer Services Manager)\nThere is a lack of tools and techniques to use for the purposes of assessing the internal\ncapabilities of organisations to design and deliver product-service offerings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the tools to assess our ability to meet a service level of agreement just as the joiner\u2019s\narm is about to put pencil to a piece of paper\u201d (ServPro, Service Operations Director)\nStrategic alignment\nStrategic alignment is the alignment of mindset and understanding towards service provision.\nIt is important that organisations share a common language and mindset, to allow a service\nprovider to \u201cthink like a customer\u201d.\n\u201c\u2026[PSS offering package name] world is a much better world, it\u2019s a much better aligned\nworld with your customer because it likes everybody else, we talk the same language\u201d\n(ServPro, Services Executive)\n\u201c\u2026we [all] must learn the jargon\u201d (ServPro, Services Innovation Manager).\nThere may be differences in the degree of alignment with different parts of the organisation\nand its customers.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in [ServPro\u2019s joint venture 1], you know when [customer A] are suffering...if you\nwork in [internal department of ServPro] you accuse the customer, the guy across the road,\nthere isn\u2019t that closeness, feeling the pain if you like of customers. I spent two years out in\n[ServPro\u2019s joint venture 1], it was one of the things that really, really hit me, it was just a\n12\nhuge alignment with the parent company, everyone knew\u201d (ServPro, Repair Engineering\nManager).\nThere have been situations where the organisation feels that changes to its offering are in the\ncustomers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 best interests, but this is not recognised by the customer\/supplier.\n\u201cIf they want it cheap they will have to accept that what [ServPro] does is in their best\ninterests\u201d (ServPro, Service Operations Director).\n\u201cThose suppliers have got to hold hands with us and recognise that their route to market is\nthrough [ServProv] in a transparent sort of way\u201d (ServPro, Service Operations Director).\nThere are inequities in the way customers and suppliers are treated by the organisation, but it\nis also recognised that there are likely to be shifts in the balance of power in these\nrelationships in the future.\nSupplier relationships\nWhen a company is transforming to become a provider of an integrated offering, a different\ndegree of insight into the problems and applications of customers is necessary, which calls for\na greater degree of cooperation between a provider and its supporting network.\nAttitudes toward suppliers have largely remained the same as they were when the\norganisation was still product centred.\n\u201cWe would be absolutely appalled if our customers treated us the way we treat our suppliers\nin terms of price, costs\u201d (ServPro, Customer Services Manager)\nEven if the language in the relationship has changed, the way the suppliers are treated has in\nmany instances remained the same.\n\u201cI think ServSup are trying to slant it a different way. I think they are tending to push full risk\ndown onto the risk sharing partners. (ServSup-2, Customer Service Manager)\nHowever, because of the downstream pressure on delivery of integrated offering, some\nchanges in attitudes towards suppliers have been detected. One of the suppliers voiced that\nthey are treated differently when it comes to support of products that are sold as an integrated\noffering.\n\u201cThere is a lot more talk about partnership now. A lot more talk about partnering\nrelationships when it comes to supporting their integrated offering\u201d (ServSup-2, Commercial\ndirector)\nProvision of an integrated offering requires information and know-how intensive exchange.\nOn the upstream side ServPro is building operational linkages and knowledge-sharing\nroutines.\n\u201cIt is the data in context which is actually giving me information, giving me knowledge\u2026 The\nquestion then is well what is it that we are actually selling here? Are we doing product\nservitization or are we trying to go a step beyond?.... In fact we have just done that with one\nof our customers. We get together, we present things to each other and share the insights\u201d.\n(ServPro, Customer Services Manager)\nThe information sharing between ServPro and its suppliers is much more limited compared to\nthe downstream side. It is limited, to the extent that it produces unwanted effects not only for\nsuppliers but potentially also for ServPro.\n13\n\u201cWe don\u2019t receive [from ServPro] any forward planning or strategy of roles going to their\nmarket place and trying to win more business into integrated offering. We read it in the\nnewspaper\u201d. (ServSup-1, Customer Service Manager).\n\u201cI think the only thing I would like to see is a lot more information off ServPro to enable us\nto manage the risk, so they can provide us more information on their sustaining engineering\nbills, their modification bills.\u201d (ServSup-2, Production\/Operations Director).\nIn spite of the supplier\u2019s willingness to adapt to a new business model and support the\nprovision of an integrated offering, a \u201cnot invented here\u201d type of mindset in ServPro resulted\nin the rejection of the supplier\u2019s help.\n\u201cWe have tried to work with ServPro and we have suggested we would like to put our people\non the ground of ServPro site to organise the movement of the parts from the product,\nthrough their dispatch to us to help the flow move along. Even a Kanban system, but ServPro\nhave turned that down, so obviously they want to control their own problems\u201d (ServSup-1,\nProduction\/Operations Director)\n5. Discussion\nThis section is organised such that firstly we indicate and describe the position of individual\ncompanies on the servitization continuum. Having identified the different levels of\nservitization, we then continue with discussion of key transformation challenges, organised\naround pillars of transformation challenges (see Figure 3).\nServPro, ServSup-1 and ServSup-2 show different levels of servitization (see Figure 4).\nServPro is a high value manufacturer and provider of customer solutions. Its customers\nvalue the relationship based on the service delivered. It offers asset utilization\nrather than asset ownership by offering a customer intimacy service. Its\nproduction strategy is configured to provide mass customisation solutions.\nServSup-1 provides equipment that is incorporated into almost every end customer\u2019s\nproduct. Its offering is based on the delivery of physical products with few\nperipheral services such as maintenance. Although the value is exchanged in the\ntransaction rather than in the relationship between supplier and provider, the\nsupplier is customising their offering to meet particular customers\u2019 needs.\nServSup-2 offers commoditised products without existing peripheral services. Its proposed\nvalue resides on the pure transaction of the tangible offering as opposed to total\nservice integration. Its production process is mainly ruled by a mass production\nstrategy.\n14\nFigure 4. Positioning of case companies in the Servitization Continuum\nWe are indicating in this study that an organisation\u2019s journey towards higher levels of\nservitization (e.g. relationship-based transactions, asset utilisation, total service integration\noffering and high levels of production customisation), is inhibited by a variety of internal and\nexternal challenges. This research indicates that these internal and external challenges are\nembedded into the five categories; i.e. embedded product-service culture, delivery of\nintegrated offering, internal processes and capabilities, strategic alignment and supplier\nrelationships (Table II).\nTable II: Key issues in each category of servitization challenges\nCategory Key issues\nEmbedded product-service\nculture\n\uf0b7 Traditional manufacturers have strong technology orientation which inhibits\nthe transformation toward a service orientated culture.\nDelivery of integrated\noffering\n\uf0b7 Product-centric orientation has to be replaced with service-centric.\n\uf0b7 Lack of organisational responsiveness can inhibit provision of integrated\noffering.\n\uf0b7 Multiple touch points are required on interface between provider and customer.\nInternal processes and\ncapabilities\n\uf0b7 Alignment of product and service design processes is required for design of\nintegrated offering and effective response to customer needs.\n\uf0b7 Performance metrics should measure organisations\u2019 collective ability in\neffective and efficient delivery of integrated offering.\nBroadening of interaction\nfrom transaction to\nrelationship, scope of change,\nthose involved in change\nDesign Manufacture Delivery Usage Support End-of-Use\nSuppliers Customers\nInteraction mainly transactional;\nsome addition of peripheral services\nProduct + service delivery\nCustomization of product and service\nProducts + service co-designed;\ntotal solutions\nH\nig\nh\nLe\nve\nlo\nfS\ner\nvi\ntiz\nat\nio\nn\nLo\nw\nServSup-2\nServSup-1\nServPro\n15\n\uf0b7 Manufacturing based metrics are not suitable for measuring product-service\nprovision.\nStrategic alignment \uf0b7 Absence of internal cooperation, common language and alignment of mindsets\nslows down transformation efforts.\nSupplier relationships \uf0b7 Transactional relationships prevent provider\u2019s external network from\neffectively supporting integrated offering.\n\uf0b7 Changes in the relationships between the product-service provider and its\ncustomers are not reflected in the relationships with the provider\u2019s suppliers.\nEvidence from the data is suggesting that embedded manufacturing culture, which has strong\ntechnological, product, and engineering orientation, inhibits the organisation\u2019s transformation\ntowards becoming a servitized organisation. It seems that although ServPro\u2019s management\nrecognised that greater customer orientation is necessary through the whole internal value\nchain, some parts of the organisation still did not move away from their traditional cultural\nroots. This is manifested for example in employees\u2019 slow response to customer needs, over-\nengineered products, absence of understanding of customer needs and strong supervisory\ncontrols.\nBecause of the characteristics of service and its presence in an integrated offering, employees\nin the providing organisation and the end customers end up in a co-production relationship\n(Bowen and Ford, 2002). The degree of co-production will vary across the organisation and\nsome functions will embrace customer orientation to a greater extent then others. There are\nseveral strategies to this. One is to build a strong service climate (Schneider, 1980) in the\nbelief that an organisation can develop a \u201cpassion for service\u201d on the basis of what it values,\nteaches, rewards and does. The other strategy is to build a service culture, as proposed by\nauthors like Berry, (1995; 1999) and Davidow and Uttal (1989).\nIn the case of ServPro, this reinforces the importance of the services culture that traditional\nmanufacturing companies need to embrace in order to meet customer expectations. Culture\nhelps to fill the gaps between what an organisation can train its employees to do and what the\nend customer expects. Bowen and Ford (2002) suggest in the context of the service industry\nthat employees should be given a certain degree of discretion over the creation and delivery of\nservice experience in order to satisfy differing needs and expectations of the end customer.\nThey also argue that rigid organisational structures and strong hierarchical controls, which are\nso valued in the manufacturing world and so evident in the case of ServPro, can significantly\nimpede an employee\u2019s ability to respond to the differing expectations of different customers.\nThe strong hierarchies that historically existed in ServPro implied a rather regimented\ncustomer interaction that involved very limited personnel\/parts of the organisation.\nDifficulties have been seen to arise when wider parts of the organisation than before are\nexposed to the customer. The shift from a transactional to a more relationship-based\ninteraction means an increase in the number and type of customer touch-points (Gundlach and\nMurphy, 1993; Lambert, 1996; Cannon and Perreault, 1999). This helps with closing the loop\nof experience of the product in use back into design, (Browning et al, 2002) and of\nunderstanding the customer, but this process is still largely under development at present.\nSome personnel are now experiencing the possibility of finding themselves taking direct calls\nfrom customers. In order to improve the customer interaction process, ServPro introduced a\nnumber of initiatives in which members of different parts of the organisation were exposed to\nthe customer. This could be viewed as not only a relationship management activity, but also\nan informal training process. Elements of organisational learning were also fostered when\n16\nthere was mobility (both inter- and intra-organisational) of personnel. Gronroos (2000) and\nBowen and Ford (2002) for instance suggest that training should be a basic component of\ninternal marketing and that employees must not only be taught about a company\u2019s products\nbut also about the service culture of the organisation and the delivery of integrated offerings.\nThe data analysis highlights a particular issue arising when an organisation coming from a\nproduct-focused background transforms to provision of a more integrated offering. There may\nbe a tendency to focus more on the product part of the offering (this is the \u201ccomfort zone\u201d of\nthe organisation) than the service aspects (Mathieu, 2001, Gebauer et al., 2006). This\nreversion to product-centricity has been mentioned as manifesting more strongly when the\norganisation is put under pressure. The culture of the organisation is, to varying degrees, still\nthat of a manufacturing firm. This is of course one of the reasons why product-service\nsystems are difficult to replicate.\nOne aspect of this that the data highlighted was that of timescales. Product-centric\norganisations (or parts of the organisation) may be accustomed to longer timescales in dealing\nwith a problem. To become more service-centric, the organisation must be capable of\nresponding much more rapidly to the customer (Oliva and Kallenberg, 2003). Therefore the\nintegrated offering requires not only an effective delivery but also a timely one, and this has\nto be enabled by a cohesive delivery system within the organisation.\nReinartz and Ulaga (2008) argue that the adoption of product-service strategy requires, among\nothers, acquisition of new capabilities that enable the organisation to compete in new service\nspaces. Evidence showed that misalignment between internal product and service design\nprocesses hindered ServPro\u2019s ability to effectively design an integrated offering or respond to\nchanges when they were required from the customer.\nInternal alignment of performance metrics will show the organisation\u2019s collective ability to\ndeliver an integrated offering; this was frequently exposed as an important challenge.\nHowever, not only alignment is needed but also a revision of what the metrics actually\nmeasure. Metrics that were designed for measuring outputs of \u201cproduct oriented\u201d\norganisations are not sophisticated enough to measure an integrated offering. This\nparticularity disabled ServPro in effectively assessing the delivery of an integrated offering to\ntheir customers, and consequently responding with corrective actions when customer needs\nwere not met. Johnston (1994) stated that quantitative measures of outputs for measuring\nservices are \u201cmeaningless algebraic solutions\u201d because they can misdirect managerial\nattention towards efficiency improvements of what may be only a marginally important\noperational sub-system. Measures for measuring inputs and outputs of integrated offerings\nwill likely require more subjective approaches (Shaw, 1990) in order to capture heterogeneity\nof customer expectations.\nA key finding from the data is that one of the major challenges relates to the alignment of\nmindset and understanding between organisations (and between different internal parts of the\norganisation). It was often described in the interviews with ServPro that strategic alignment is\neased when there is common language between provider and customer, or between different\nparts of the organisation. As previously mentioned, this has successfully been enabled in\nServPro by: a) mobility of personnel between organisations\/divisions and b) workshops or\nsimilar events involving multi-discipline personnel.\nThis approach could be interpreted as containing elements of spontaneous change processes,\nwhereby change is proactively sought by introducing disruptors (e.g. staff secondments); and\nof a reactive process where there may be a lead from one, more servitized, part of the\norganisation, which then induces other parts of the organisation to react to the new\n17\nenvironment. These changes have also started to bring about alignment of metrics across\ndifferent organisations.\nMultiple evidence from this study suggests that a manufacturer\u2019s journey towards becoming a\nservitized organisation is not only hindered by internal, but also by external factors.\nRelationships with the external network play a critical role (Windhal and Lakemond, 2006).\nThis is because a product is often provided by one organisation and support and services by\nmembers of a broader supply network. When a company is transforming to become a provider\nof an integrated offering, a different degree of insight into the problems and applications of\ncustomers is necessary, which calls for a greater degree of cooperation between a provider\nand its supporting network. Whilst empirical data indicate changes towards a greater degree\nof cooperation on the downstream side of ServPro\u2019s network, this change was not effectively\ntranslated on the upstream side. The presence of a service component in an integrated offering\nmakes the content of exchange in a relationship significantly different when compared to that\nfor products. Services, regarded also as \u201cinvisible assets\u201d Itami (1987) or \u201ctacit know-how\nassets\u201d by Teece (1986) are according to Helper and Levine (1982) and Zajac and Olsen\n(1993) more easily employed through relational rather then transactional exchange. This helps\nto explain the unwanted effects that ServPro and its suppliers experienced in provision of an\nintegrated offering. A greater degree of cooperation, which is characterised by the presence of\ncooperative norms of behaviour, greater know-how and information exchange, relationship\ntransparency, mutual adaptations and tighter operational linkages (Dyer and Singh, 1998;\nCannon and Perreault, 1999), would likely result in improvements in ServPro\u2019s supply\nnetwork responsiveness and overall support in the provision of an integrated offering.\n6. Conclusions and Future Work\nThis paper has addressed the challenges faced by manufacturers adopting servitization as a\nnew strategy for achieving competitive advantage. The research was conducted in response to\na current lack of understanding of the specific issues surrounding the transition from a\nproduct-centric to a servitized organisational structure. It is important to note that the research\nhas sought out challenges noted by the companies; the case companies are broadly successful,\nand talk about being successful, in their plan to more closely integrate product and service\nofferings. The data represents their views on challenges that they have met and are already\ntackling. Key findings arising from this research centre around the proposition of a new \u201cFive\nPillar\u201d model, where the five categories: embedded product-service culture, delivery of\nintegrated offering, internal processes and capabilities, strategic alignment, and supplier\nrelationships, form a supporting foundation that enables the challenges of the servitization\nprocess to be met.\nThe greater integration of the offering itself has direct and clear implications for the\norganisation(s) designing and delivering that offering. In particular there is a need for greater\nintegration between internal functions (including requests for more integrated measurement,\npolicy deployment and language), between an organisation and the customer using the\noffering, and also with suppliers. Integrated activity is seen to occur during design,\nnegotiation, planning, manufacture, service delivery, process design, and other processes. The\ndata suggests that servitizing organisations are increasing their involvement in such activities\nand improving their integration as a result. Further integration requires improvement to the\nfive pillars of embedded product-service culture, delivery of integrated offering, internal\nprocesses and capabilities, strategic alignment, and supplier relationships.\nWe also relate the challenges faced by an organisation to the position on the servitization\ncontinuum that it is attempting to reach. Low levels of servitization may be achieved with\n18\nrelatively minimal adoption of the criteria embodied within the five pillars; deeper levels of\nservitization require a much broader interaction between supplier and customer, hence the\nchallenges faced are more severe and must be more strongly supported by the pillars.\nThis research is intended to be of use to both the academic and practitioner community. It is\nhoped that these initial findings will open a debate around the particular challenges faced by\norganisations undergoing servitization, and begin to build a body of theory that addresses the\ncurrent gap in the literature. For practitioners, the experiences of the case study companies\npresented here, and the discussion of the particular challenges that may be expected when\nservitizing, will help to promote awareness of what the potential \u201croadblocks\u201d on the\ntransformation journey could be.\nResearch Limitations and Future Work\nThe main limitation is that this research is based on a single case study. The insights into\nexternal challenges are limited to the upstream side of the supply chain only. Insight from the\ndownstream side would provide additional depth and perhaps yield converging conclusions\non the level of inter-organisational relationships. The future research in this area would\nbenefit from a multiple case approach as a next step, followed by a survey which would allow\nfor statistical generalizations.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of the EPSRC\/IMRC under grant number\n[IMRC 154], which is supporting Product Service Systems research.\n7.
