From this discussion, we seek to contribute to \ncumulative refinement of the scenario process. \n \n \n1. Introduction \nO\u201fBrien (2004) categorised scenario planning as part of \u201csoft\u201d operational \nresearch, in that it satisfies the characteristics of soft OR described by Rosenhead \n 2 \nand Mingers (2001), and Bennett and Huxham (1982). Specifically, scenario \nplanning (i) aids understanding of a situation, (ii) enhances creativity, (iii) is process-\nfocussed, (iv) requires input from multiple actors, (v) is focussed on perceptions and \nopinions, and (vi) contains an analytical component that is qualitative. The focus of \nO\u201fBrien\u201fs paper was an analysis of the process and the product of scenario planning \nteaching at Warwick Business School: \u201cby scanning the product and identifying \ndeficiencies (the paper) aims to improve the process itself\u201d (O\u201fBrien, 2004: 711). \nO\u201fBrien relates a change in style of delivery \u2013 from lectures to facilitated scenario \nconstruction \u2013 and the addition of extra steps in the scenario construction process to \nenable more effective scenario development, by her student audience. The changes \nthat she relates reveal the pioneering nature of scenario teaching at Warwick. From \nanalysis of the process and products of 15 years of teaching\/facilitating the course \nand the experiences of over 1,000 participants, she identified five \u201ccommon\u201d pitfalls \nemanating from the \u201cearly version of the methodology\u201d which was taught to MBA \nstudents as a process to produce scenarios.  \n \nThe pitfalls identified by O\u201fBrien were:  \n1) Predictability of a limited set of factor choices.  Here, use of a PEST \nmethod by participants tended to regularly emphasise economic factors -\nsuch as exchange rates, interest rates, and UK economic activity - as \nuncertainties that were subsequently given prominence in the scenarios \nthat participants constructed \n2) Predictability of theme selection.  Here, many participants developed \neither optimistic or pessimistic scenarios \n 3 \n3) Focus on current \/next\/ big issues.  Here, recent and current concerns \n(e.g. of terrorism activities) that had emphasis in the media tended to \nreplicate themselves in the scenarios that participants provided.  O\u201fBrien \nlabelled this as \u201cfuture myopia\u201d \n4) Typical implicit assumptions.  Here, life experiences shared by \nparticipants (e.g. of peacetime rather than war) were also replicated by \nparticipants in their construction of scenarios \n5) Unimaginative presentation of scenarios.  Here, the completed scenario \noutput tended to be presented with little attention to making an impact on \nthe target audience \n \n \nO\u201fBrien concluded that the above five pitfalls resulted in \u201cpredictable, somewhat \nnarrow and unchallenging scenarios, unlikely to engage their intended audience\u201d \n(2004: 715).  In the final section of her paper, O\u201fBrien addressed three process \nadaptations as means of overcoming these pitfalls, namely: \n1. \u201cParticipants:  who is using scenario planning?\u201d  Here, O\u201fBrien argued \nthat participants\u201f personal world-views and life experiences cannot, in fact, be \ncontrolled or influenced and can only be acknowledged as a pre-set anchor in \nscenario development. \n2. \u201cContent: what is the scenario process?\u201d  Here, O\u201fBrien argues that \nlecturers\u201f exhortations to participants to be \u201cmore creative\u201d in their scenario \ndevelopment worked reasonably well in that \u201cunchallenging themes appeared less \nfrequently\u201d (2004:  715).  However, adding a step where (i) individual participants \nbrainstormed uncertain and predetermined factors and then a step where (ii) groups \n 4 \nof participants clustered (and thereby reduced) this output, produced, she argued, a \nmore diverse and rich set of factors that could shape the future.  O\u201fBrien also \nencouraged participants to \u201c..think beyond the traditional PEST categories and thus \nto consider additional categories such as \u201ecompetition\u201f and \u201eregulation\u201f \u201c(2004: 716). \nThe second revision to the earlier version of Warwick\u201fs scenario construction \nmethod was to encourage participants to consider alternative, higher impact ways to \ncommunicate scenario content \u2013 beyond tabular summaries.  Finally, O\u201fBrien added \na step in the Warwick scenario construction process, where strategic options for an \norganization were tested for robustness across the set of constructed scenarios. \n3. \u201cProcess:  how is the scenario process conveyed to participants?\u201d  \nHere the focus was, again, on encouraging creativity within the scenario \ndevelopment process and the following possibilities were offered: \nI)    using the internet as a resource for reports on issues relevant to future studies \nii)   use of a facilitating mode of delivery rather than a traditional lecture mode \niii) emphasis that, at an early stage of the scenario teaching, the lecturers\u201f \nexpectation was that the scenario process would produce creative output  \niv)  challenging deep-set assumptions in the participants that the future will be like \nthe past. An example O\u201fBrien gave is that of identifying individuals in the audience \nwho know people who cannot read or write.  Such an identification process can \n\u201cchallenge pre-conceived ideas about how advanced society has become\u201d (2004: \n717) \nv) emphasising the development and use of scenario outcome presentations that \npromote audience impact \u2013 such as TV\/radio news broadcasts, newspaper \nheadlines etc.  Also advocated was consideration of alternative ways of presenting \nnarratives, written in the past, present or future tenses \n 5 \n \nIn seeking to offer further incremental development and refinement of scenario \nmethod, we know turn to our own experience of both teaching on MBA programmes \nin two UK business schools, and working with top management teams on a range of \nscenario projects in the business arena. . \n Drawing upon illustrative examples from this experience, we reappraise each \nof O\u201fBrien\u201fs pitfalls in turn, presenting our recommendations and then comparing and \ncontrasting these with O\u201fBrien\u201fs responses to these pitfalls, outlined earlier.  In \naddition, we point to additional concerns that we have identified, both in O\u201fBrien\u201fs \napproach to scenario planning and from our own experience working with students \nand organizations.  We discuss the implications of these additional pitfalls and \npropose our own solutions to overcoming them. \n \n2. Revisiting O\u201fBrien\u201fs \u201epitfalls\u201f in scenario development \n \nPitfall 1:  Predictability of a limited set of factor choices   \n \nOur own method of facilitating the development of a wider range of scenario \ndimensions aims to overcome the \u201csilo\u201d laundry-listing that can emerge from a simple \nelicitation of participants\u201f ideas using the categories within PEST (Political, \nEconomic, Societal, and Technological) or its derivatives (STEEP and PESTEL, \nPESTLED etc) that prompt elicitation of further issues of current concern - such as \nLaw, Ecology and Demographics.  Burt et al (in press) have noted that there is a \ngrowing recognition in the research literature that the nature of the business \nenvironment is best conceptualised as organization-specific (Montgomery et al 1989) \n 6 \n\u2013 thus recognising the limited applicability of generic, taxonomic approaches such as \nPEST. Indeed, the business environment can be conceptualised as the outcome of \norganizational processes, and thus as being socially constructed (Berger and \nLuckman 1966; Eden 1992; Weick 1979, 1995; Mir and Watson 2000). \nAlthough, as with O\u201fBrien\u201fs approach, the initial stage of our scenario method \ninvolves identification and recording of areas of interest or concern to the participants \nabout their organization\u201fs contextual environment, using the PEST (or its \nadaptations, such as PESTEL) categories as a generator of ideas, we find that new \ninsights are seldom generated - since what has been listed is frequently presented in \nfairly general terms, and is already well known to participants. The taxonomic \nclassifications of PEST and its derivatives are, we contend, of limited help to an \norganization in exploring and understanding its environment because they are too \ngeneric, fail to deliver understanding of the inter-relationships and inter-dependences \namong variables, and do not produce a detailed understanding of the dynamics of \nchange. At this stage, we would highlight our view that, first, the limitations of PEST \nanalysis can be addressed through expansion of the set of involved actors in the \nprocess, as in the introduction of \u201eremarkable people\u201f, in order to broaden the field of \nthinking on the problem in question. Second, we would point out that even a \nconstraining PEST analysis may hold advantages, in that it may force individuals \nwithin the group to move beyond their own \u201ebounded rationality\u201f (March and Simon, \n1958) within a particular sphere of, say, the \u201etechnological\u201f or \u201eeconomic\u201f.  \nWhilst some scenario projects develop scenarios that deal with global or \nregional issues at a very general level \u2013 so-called global scenarios - we find that \ncontextualizing scenario construction within a client organization, or in the minds of \nstudents, requires that the \u201cbusiness issue\u201d to be addressed should be clearly \n 7 \ndefined \u2013 so-called decision-focused scenarios. The pitfall of developing non-\ncontextualized, global scenarios, to our minds, is that these can only take account of \nthe PEST factors at a superficial level, whereas scenarios which are built around an \nissue of concern \u2013 often the continuing viability of an organisation\u201fs current success \nformula or \u201cbusiness idea\u201d (van der Heijden, 1996) \u2013 require judgements about the \nrelevance of environmental factors to be made in relation to that issue of concern. \nWe detail the specifics of our decision-focussed scenario construction methodology \nin the next section of this paper: \u201dPitfall 2: predictability of theme selection\u201d. \nSeeking to expand the boundaries of group thinking within an organization-\nfocused scenario project, there is a need to move beyond simple listings and \ndescriptions of the environment and to help management teams understand their \nenvironment \u2013 or rather, the \u201emultiple realities\u201f (Beech and Cairns, 2001) of their \ndifferent world views that are socially-constructed through narratives, dialogue and \nconversation (Smircich and Stubbart 1985). It is in relation to the facilitation of \nunderstanding and interchange between these different world views, in order to open \nup a \u201estrategic conversation\u201f (van der Heijden, 1996) about the complexity and \nambiguity of and exposition of multiple perspectives on organizational problems in \nthe present, that we see the key value of scenario method, rather than in any notion \nof them presenting different \u201erealities\u201f of what the future might be. \nIn developing a broader understanding of the world at large, one further pitfall \nwhich we identified - whether working with students on a problem with which they are \nlargely unfamiliar, or with an organization in which there is a good depth of \nunderstanding of the issue, but from an internal perspective - is a tendency for \ninformation drawn from external sources through a PEST analysis to be treated as \n\u201cknowledge\u201d, in that the veracity of the source is not questioned, or that a single \n 8 \nsource is accepted without validation through triangulation.  We term this pitfall, the \nassumed veracity of obtained knowledge. That is to say, that information taken, for \nexample, from Internet sources will often remain unchallenged, by scenario team \nmembers, in terms of the veracity of the source of the knowledge. Often there is little \nevaluation of potential vested interests involved, i.e., little or no consideration of how \n\u201cknowledge\u201d is socially constructed according to the knowledge-originator\u201fs beliefs, \nvalues and rationalities. \nOur experience of working with students indicates that this pitfall is more likely \nto be overcome when building scenarios surrounding an issue which, for most, lies \nbeyond their range of experience and their expectation of the class. For example, \nwhen we introduced a project on exploring scenarios for sustainable healthcare and \neducation in Sub-Saharan Africa to MBA students, the initial reaction of many \u2013 \nparticularly the most able \u2013 was to challenge us on what this had to do with business \neducation. However, because the scenario project dealt with largely unknown \nterritory, the exercise (i) challenged students\u201f intellects and the socio-economic \nrationale of their day-to-day thinking, (ii) introduced a moral\/ethical dimension to their \nthinking, and (iii) generated not only a large amount of research, but also critical \ndiscussion and consideration of the political and other agendas of sources of \ninformation, and analysis of the causal linkages between different factors and the \nagency of the various involved actors.  \nIn short, we believe that emphasis on analyzing and understanding the \nenvironment should shift from mere data-gathering (even from the broadest range of \nsources) to detailed consideration of how members of the organization (or in a \nteaching context, members of the participant team) perceive relationships among \nuncertainties and pre-determined outcomes. Cognitive activity acts to make these \n 9 \nrelationships meaningful to involved actors and to help them understand the agency \nof others. Aiding participants\u201f recognition and understanding of the inter-relatedness \nand dynamic interaction of such variables and the multiple possibilities for their \nresolution is, we believe, the key to effective environmental analysis. As an \nuncertainty in one of the variables within a PEST dimension resolves itself, one way \nor the other, as an outcome, that outcome will often be perceived to impact other \nvariables (within and between PEST dimensions) and so have a domino-like \npropagation \u2013 as a particular scenario unfolds. The level of sophistication of the \nstudents\u201f analysis is, at this stage, dependent upon the breadth of the investigation, \nin terms of the number of factors identified, and the depth of understanding, in \nrelation to the specificity of the information which informs participants\u201f \nunderstandings of a particular issue.  \nIn order to broaden the scope of analysis in both our teaching and in our \nconsultancy approach, the factors generated from the PEST brainstorming exercise \nare, in our scenario methodology, next collated by participants into clusters of inter-\nrelated factors that span the dimensions of PEST.  Clustering is the activity of \ngrouping causally related uncertainties with pre-determined elements and capturing, \ngraphically, a group\u201fs (emergent) understanding of the linkages and relationships \namong them.  The process is designed not only to help participants to understand \nlinkages of causality and chronology, but also to reduce a wide range of issues and \nideas into a smaller number of higher-level concepts - the names of the cluster \ncontents, once clarified.  In Figures 1 and 2, we provide an example to illustrate and \namplify the process of grouping and labelling inter-related factors. In Figure 1, we \nillustrate a STEEP-evoked listing of some of the factors identified by students at \n 10 \nconsidering scenarios for sustainable health and education in Sub-Saharan Africa \n(here, based upon 81 factors identified by one group of 6 students). \n ------------------------------------ \nInsert Figure 1 about here \n  ----------------------------------- \n \nNext, we asked participants to look behind the occurrence of specific events \n(i.e., resolved outcomes of uncertainties or pre-determined elements) and look for \npatterns and structures that underpin their occurrence. We directed participants to \ncreate linkages which would explain the behaviour of variables \u2013 and to express \nthese linkages in the form of influence diagrams that represented and clarified such \nrelationships.  At this point, we should address two possible critical responses to the \nprocess thus far; one philosophical and one content-related. The philosophical \nquestion is that of how the notion of social construction that is inherent in the \nscenario process is reconciled with social construction\u201fs denial of causality, as \nperceived in positivistic terms, in that investigation of causality is advocated.  The \nanswer to the first question is related to that of the second. The investigations of \n\u201ecausality\u201f which are induced in the scenario process advocated here are based \nupon acceptance that they are mere social constructions. As such, as these causal \nlinkages are discussed within the group process and subjected to multiple \ninterpretations and reinterpretations, new factors are likely to be surfaced and can be \nincorporated into the process. This incorporation of new elements can happen at any \ntime. In complex scenario projects, with multiple iterations of the process, there will \nbe a cumulative aggregation of factors considered. But, even in simple, single-\niteration scenario constructions, the structure of the process should not be seen as \n 11 \nsacrosanct, excluding adaptation and incorporation of new ideas at any stage in \norder to increase the depth of understanding of the issue under consideration. \n Figure 2 documents some of the \u201ccross-disciplinary\u201d links that were formed \nfrom the content of a STEEP-evoked listing based upon the exercise illustrated in \nFigure 1. We present two clusters of cross-disciplinary, linked factors indicating how \nparticipants perceive the various factors to interact and influence one another at the \nparticular stage in the project. \n--------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 2 about here \n--------------------------------------- \n \nWe now turn to highlight two key differences between our scenario construction \nmethodology and that of O\u201fBrien (2004). First, in the initial identification of factors, \nwe do not seek pre-judgement of whether they are predetermined or uncertain, for \ninstance, by requiring specification of \u201ca minimum of 40 uncertain factors plus a \nsmaller number of predetermined elements\u201d (2004: 716). Rather, we enable \nparticipants to consider the question of certainty\/uncertainty as one of emergent \nrelativity between issues, not as categorical dichotomous choice at the outset. \nSecond, the process of reduction to a smaller number of clusters is not one of \nexclusion or of prioritization, since the content of each cluster is retained, and all \nindividual factor outcomes are considered and placed within one of the four scenario \nstorylines at the end, in order to add richness and diversity to the content. In \naddition, as highlighted above, additional factors may be introduced at any time \nduring the process, such that process does not take precedence of purpose. We \nreturn to the practicalities of this stage of our scenario construction methodology in \nthe next section of this paper: \u201cPitfall 2: predictability of theme selection\u201d. \n 12 \nBy bringing the STEEP variables together in such an exercise, our scenario \nmethod enables participants to look behind the obvious, taxonomic nature of STEEP, \nin order to develop a deeper, inter-connected understanding of the interplay among \nvariables, as well as the causal logic of relationships amongst these variables.  In the \nexercise illustrated in Figure 2, the clusters were generated through a process of \nparticipants engaging in a \u201cstrategic conversation\u201d (van der Heijden, 1996), in which \nall of the 81 factors identified were placed on a wall, then manoeuvred into initial \nclusters, moved again, regrouped numerous times over a period of about one hour, \nand finally grouped into a set of 8 clusters. The only rule of this stage was that the \ncomponents of each cluster must be connected by arrows showing cause\/effect  \nimpact or chronological relatedness - such that each element within a cluster is \nconnected to every other, either directly or indirectly. This form of \ncausal\/chronological relationship analysis elicits detailed conversation and \nconsideration of the inter-relatedness of different factors across the STEEP \ncategories, and leads to their breakdown and re-conceptualization in new ways, \nalbeit that the relationships must always be seen to be socially constructed, rather \nthan indicative of some objective \u201etruth\u201f. \nThe next step in our methodology involves naming the clusters, encapsulating \nevery constituent element under an overarching title which identifies a higher-level \nissue of impact upon the issue of concern. In this case example, the issue of concern \nwas the future viability of a particular, named, organisation involved in the provision \nof health education in Sub-Saharan Africa. The titles that participants gave to the two \nillustrative clusters are also shown in Figure 2. \n \nPitfall 2: Predictability of theme selection \n 13 \n \nIn the second stage of our scenario process, we ask participants to write their \ncluster headings on new post-its and place these post-its on an impact\/predictability \nchart. Our instructions are as follows: \n \n\u2022 Post cluster headings on the Impact\/Predictability chart (using post-its). Rank, \nfirst, in terms of impact on the issue of concern (horizontally), then on predictability \n(vertically) (Note: here, we clarify that we refer to predictability of the outcome of the \nissue\/event, not of its happening). \n\u2022 Which of these cluster headings would really make a difference for the case \norganization when the events, therein, resolve themselves one way or the other? \n \nFigure 3 illustrates the placing of cluster headings on the impact\/predictability \nchart, and identifies the \u201cscenario structuring space\u201d \u2013 where cluster headings \ncontaining the potential scenario dimension are physically located.  Note that our \ntwo, illustrative, cluster headings are included on the impact\/predictability matrix. \n \n---------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 3 about here \n---------------------------------------- \n \nOur next instructions to participants are: \n \n 14 \n\u2022 Consider the \u201cmore impact\/less predictable\u201d corner and try to identify the 2 \nmost important cluster headings (bottom right quadrant). Each cluster heading is, \npotentially, the name of a scenario dimension \n\u2022 Identify two plausible outcomes for each of the two scenario dimensions. \n \nFigure 4 illustrates two plausible outcomes for each of two potential scenario \ndimensions - based upon the student project on scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa, \noutlined above.  \n---------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 4 about here \n----------------------------------------- \n \nOur next step is to ask our participants if the outcome combinations A1B1, \nA2B2, A2B1, and A2B2 are viable pairings of the plausible outcomes that were \npreviously identified. If one or, at most, two of the four pairings are not seen by \nparticipants as viable, then this is indicative that the two potential scenario \ndimensions are not independent of one another and can be collapsed into a single \ndimension. In such a case, participants are advised to choose another potential \ndimension from amongst those other cluster headings in the lower right-hand \nquadrant of the scenario structuring space. In this way, two independent dimensions \nare elicited from participants. Since these dimensions are a result of the \u201ccross-\ndisciplinary\u201d clustering in Stage 1 of our scenario construction process, the potential \npitfall of \u201cpredictability of theme selection\u201d is attenuated \u2013 the obvious, PEST-derived \ndimensions are avoided. Also, as a consequence of our process, the construction of \noptimistic and pessimistic futures is avoided \u2013 since the plausible outcomes will, \n 15 \nnecessarily, contain a mix of positive and negative factors that interact in the causal \nchains, both within and between clusters. \n \nPitfall 3: Focus on current \/ next big\/ issues \n \nO\u201f Brien identified the dominance of recent and current concerns of participants \nin their scenario development and called it \u201cfuture myopia\u201d. In behavioural decision \nresearch, \u201cfuture myopia\u201d can be viewed as an \u201cavailability bias\u201d and\/or \u201canchoring-\nand-insufficient-adjustment bias\u201d (see Tversky and Kahneman, 1974, for a review). A \nmore general conceptualisation of \u201cfuture myopia\u201d is that of a \u201cframing bias\u201d \u2013 a term \nwhich refers to an inappropriate conceptualisation of a decision context. In our view, \nthis potential pitfall in scenario development will not necessarily be overcome \nthrough the participation of in-organization \u201cexperts\u201d in scenario construction \nprocess. Even with in-depth analysis through processes of structured interviews with \nkey actors, and research carried out over time both inside the organization and in \nrelation to external factors, we consider it necessary to challenge the framing of \norganisational participants - and their (what may be) partial view on the nature of the \nfuture - by introducing the input of \u201cremarkable people\u201d (van der Heijden et al., 2002; \nSchwartz, 1991) drawn from relevant external sources. This challenge to thinking is \nmost easily achieved in practice rather than in student learning. The reason for this is \nthat the inclusion of \u201cremarkable people\u201d into a scenario process, in order to \nattenuate framing bias, is likely to be a costly exercise. By remarkable people, we do \nnot necessarily refer to those who are \u201emore expert\u201f than the involved actors, since \nwe acknowledge that organizational participants will indeed be the experts in relation \nto their own context. In addition, as Cairns et al (2004) argued, the term \u201cremarkable \n 16 \nperson\u201d is not necessarily best applied to those who are expert in the field of \ninvestigation.  Experts can be so narrowly focused on current best practice that they \nare embedded in business-as-usual thinking.  Rather, we refer to those with \nknowledge that can challenge and extend the inherent knowledge of participants \u2013 \nand perhaps change participants\u201f perceptions of, what are seen to be, high-impact \nuncertainties into perceptions of pre-determined, lower-impact, elements. \nAlternatively, their insights might turn perceptions of, what were previously seen as, \npredetermined elements into uncertainties.  \nThe role of the remarkable person in the conversation is to challenge the \nthinking of the scenario team and their preconceptions of a situation. In other words, \nthe process encourages individuals to critically engage with their own cultural \nprogramming.   In seeking appropriately creative and challenging thinkers, it is \npossible to look both to those at the leading edge of knowledge development in the \nspecific problem context, and among those leading the field in a different context.  It \nis also possible to find remarkable people in related fields that are, perhaps, at a \nhigher level of development.  For instance, if we were seeking a remarkable person\u201fs \ninput into conversations on potential futures in low-cost air travel in Europe, we \nwould consider including individuals who have knowledge concerned with futures in \nhigh-speed rail travel, governance in the European Union, the changing political \nenvironment, and the effects of international terrorism. \nObviously, the choice of remarkable people is dependent, to a large extent, on \nbudget and availability, but one lesson from practice is the importance providing a \nchallenge to the mindsets of scenario participants in the scenario team. The most \neffective \u201eremarkable person\u201f is not the one who merely adds detail to what \nparticipants already know, but who causes them to challenge the very foundations of \n 17 \ntheir knowledge and to test its robustness in the context of different social \nconstructions. Even in the academic arena, we have found students to be extremely \nresourceful in finding access to remarkable people, drawing upon their networks of \nfamily, friends, business colleagues, and even through \u201ccold calling\u201d upon suitable \ncandidates  at long-range using Internet resources. In short, any activity to generate \nand challenge pre-existent framing is, we believe, a valuable exercise. \nThe short case description that follows next illustrates the use of remarkable \npeople in scenario practice with organizations, here in the field of local government. \nCairns et al (2004) explored e-government futures within a scenario intervention that \nincluded representatives from multiple agencies \u2013 including local councils, police \nauthorities, education authorities, the UK Benefits Agency, and the charity Age \nConcern. In the intervention, we sought to bring into the conversation examples of \nleading-edge, future-oriented thinking from the arenas of information and \ncommunication technology (ICT), from those tasked with turning ideas from seeming \nscience fiction for most of us into practical propositions for business in the next \ndecade.  In addition, we involved critical thinkers on the role of governance in \nsociety, and on the relationships between governments, businesses and \ncommunities.  Finally, we sought to expose the group to the implementation of e-\ngovernment initiatives in other countries, from the USA to Singapore and Australia \u2013 \ncountries where current technologies were being pushed to their limits or where \nboundaries of public\/private were being challenged.  These inputs were not intended \nto show solutions to the problem at hand by copying from these other arenas.  \nRather, they were intended to open up members\u201f thinking to a wider range of \u201elimits \nof the possible\u201f \u2013 what might be plausible and feasible in their own context, both now \nand in the future. \n 18 \nAs outlined in the previous section, we consider that analysis of the role and \nagency of different actors is an essential part of the scenario process. In our \napproach, this is further supported by the use of \u201cstakeholder analysis\u201d (van der \nHeijden et al. 2002), in which the widest possible range of individuals and \norganizations who can affect or be affected by the issue under consideration are \nidentified, and their relative degrees of power over, and interest in, the outcomes of a \nparticular scenario as it unfolds are considered. As such, the actions of powerful, \ninterested, stakeholders will serve to preserve and enhance their own interests and \nthese actions should be added, as a final ingredient, into the scenario storylines. \nStakeholder analysis is a dynamic process used, first, to help develop the scenarios, \nand, second, as part of the testing of options generated from the scenario process. \nDiscussion of the power\/interest matrix can be a powerful tool for uncovering biases \nin thinking within groups. For example, in considering scenarios for education and \nhealthcare in Sub-Saharan Africa, there was an initial tendency for participants to put \n\u201cchildren in Africa\u201d at the centre of their thinking, and to consider them as having a \nmajor impact on the issue. Through consideration of the matrix, it was recognised \nthat this approach was based upon emotional, rather than rational criteria. The \npowerlessness of key actors was identified here. In other examples, groups identified \nhigh power groups who had little or no interest in the current situation, but whose \ninterest might be awakened at some point as a particular scenario unfolds \u2013 and who \nwould then act. Similarly, groups with high interest and little power were identified, \nand consideration given to how they might seek to form political alliances with these \nhigh-power groups within the storylines of particular scenarios. In short, both the use \nof remarkable people and the use of stakeholder analyses enable the development \n 19 \nof scenarios that give a clearer, non-myopic, view of the nature of the future as it \nunfolds in a particular scenario storyline. \n \nPowell and Swart (2005) and Swart and Powell (2006) detail a method that \npresents a traceable, qualitative, scenario generation process which accesses \nparticipants\u201f subjective understanding of the dynamics of the transition process \nbetween possible future scenarios. Their method builds on prior work by Rhyne (eg \n1974) and represents the participants\u201f views of the use of knowledge by human \nactors in fulfilling their specific roles within an interacting system. This \nconceptualisation can extend stakeholder analysis. However, by caution, note that \nLiebl (2002) views complex societal problems as in principle, not  amenable to \ndecomposition into cause-effect linkages \u2013 the consequences arising from  a set of \nactions can be indeterminate or unpredictable in highly politicised situations when \nthere are conflicts between stakeholders. \n \n \nPitfall 4: Typical implicit assumptions \n \nBy broadening out of the field of investigation, introducing the processes of \nclustering and naming, involving remarkable people, and applying stakeholder \nanalysis to both scenario storyline development and option analysis, we consider \nthat O\u201fBrien\u201fs fourth pitfall; typical implicit assumptions; may be addressed, in that \nparticipants are challenged to surface and share their individual value-rationalities, \nand are introduced to perspectives from outside their immediate context of day-to-\nday activities.  In addition, as Schwartz (1991) points out, information may be both \n 20 \nenhanced and filtered through engagement with a broad range of published sources \nthat can offer valued insights into the issue in question. In teaching, we frequently \nbring to the classroom a selection of that week\u201fs quality newspapers and journals \nsuch as The Economist or Time, pointing out that there will be a range of reports of \nrelevance to practically any complex organizational problem. \nThe role of the facilitator is also key to overcoming the constraints of implicit \nassumptions. In our practice, we adopt the approach of using \u201cround robin\u201d elicitation \nof issues linked to the scenario agenda at the outset, whereby each participant in \nturn is required to raise one issue at a time, until all ideas are exhausted. As ideas \nare presented, only questions of clarification are permitted, and no idea can be \nchallenged and excluded at this stage. The establishment of an unthreatening \nenvironment in which any and every idea can be aired is crucial. Whilst O\u201fBrien \n(2004: 717) stresses the need for \u201creminding participants that they should expect to \nproduce creative work\u201d, we believe that there is nothing more likely to stifle creativity \nthan the negative reaction of peers or, in particular, superiors within the organization. \nBy utilising the round-robin approach to idea generation, we attempt, in our scenario \npractice, to provide \u201cairtime\u201d for each of the participants\u201f viewpoints on issues related \nto the scenario agenda \n \nPitfall 5: Unimaginative presentation of scenarios \n \nO\u201fBrien stresses the importance of attracting audience attention with the final \nscenario presentation, and places emphasis on the selection of media by \nencouraging creative use of ideas such as mock newspaper or television reports. \nO\u201fBrien notes that some students preferred not to write narratives, whilst others \n 21 \nwould construct causally-related \u2013 but uninspiring \u2013 storylines. Whilst we would \nagree that the impact of the scenarios (on an audience outside of those who have \nconstructed the scenarios) relies upon first gaining attention, we note that a media-\nrich, PowerPoint presentation can, sometimes, hide a lack of in-depth analysis of the \ncausal patterns underlying events. In our work on e-government, we found that an \naudience\u201fs attention was sharply focused when a presented scenario was (i) seen to \nbe grounded in common perceptions of the present, and (ii) unfolded, logically, from \nthe perceived present into a rich picture of a future via a believable progression. \nFrom our consultancy practice, we observe that the greatest impact upon \norganizational thinking came from those scenarios in which causally-unfolding \nstorylines were both plausible and discomforting \u2013 revealing that the future might not \nrepresent a comfortable continuum from the past and transition from the present. We \nhave termed this experience the \u201corganisational jolt\u201d (van der Heijden et al, 2002). \nOur goal, in scenario construction, is to provide enabling conditions to challenge \ncurrent thinking and evoke a strategic conversation within an organisation (or within \na student team).  Such a challenge to thinking prompts renewed scrutiny of both (i) \nthe organisation and its current success formula and (ii) the organisation\u201fs current \nstrategies - the viability of which is to be tested against the organisationally-focussed \nscenarios in the final stage of our scenario methodology. We detail this final stage of \nour scenario methodology in Section 3: \u201cassessing the robustness of strategies\u201d. \nWith the best student groups, also, we found that a focus, in scenario \ndevelopment, on the plausibility and coherence of the developed storylines, \nillustrated by reference to \u201ereal\u201f events and their implications, attracted greater \nattention and a more thoughtful response, not only from us as tutors and markers, \nbut from their peers as well. In the project to study Sub-Saharan Africa, writing over \n 22 \n3 years ago, one student group attracted the attention of their audience by reference \nto how \u201ceven the one positive of the Mugabe period, an excellent primary education \nsystem as a result of one of the highest levels of spending on education in Africa, \nhas dwindled due to lack of investment and shortage of teachers\u201d. Looking further \ninto the future, the student group posited that investment \u201cfrom 2008 onwards was \nincreasingly looked upon as being concerned only with the \u201erape\u201f of dwindling natural \nresources and the lining of the pockets of a number of authoritarian leaders\u201d. \n Figure 5 contains extracts from the four scenarios that were developed from \nthe two scenario dimensions identified in Figure 4. \n---------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 5 about here \n---------------------------------------- \nThus, we would concur that the effectiveness of scenario planning is, in part, a \nfunction of the medium of presentation, but would argue that a sophisticated and \ncritical audience will look beyond the surface veneer of the media employed, to seek \nout the evidence of comprehensive, in-depth research and logical analysis, which \nunderpins the perceived plausibility of the constructed scenarios. \n \n \n3. Assessing the robustness of strategies \n \nO\u201fBrien\u201fs final revision to her original scenario development process involved \nthe inclusion of a step which made explicit the impact of the scenarios on the \norganisation (using a TOWS matrix to stimulate debate). In explaining this step she \nalso refers to: \u201cone final test \u2013 explicitly check each option under each scenario to \n 23 \nsee if it is robust\u201d. We believe that use of the TOWS matrix \u2013 and linking this analysis \nto other methods for generating, evaluating, and selecting strategic options is a \nstrong contribution to emerging practice. However, assessing the implications of \nstrategies and their robustness is likely to be a difficult task for unaided participants \nin many scenario planning exercises. Many organisations will have a plurality of \nobjectives to consider in their planning processes (for example objectives relating to \nfinancial return, the environment and employee welfare).  This means that if there \nare m strategies that need to be evaluated against n objectives under p scenarios \nthen m x n x p evaluations will need to be performed. However, these evaluations \nwould not only require i) an assessment of the performance of each strategy under \neach objective and scenario, they would also involve: ii) the need to make trade-offs \nbetween the objectives and iii) the need to assess the robustness of the multi-\nattributed outcomes across the scenarios. The evidence of psychological research is \nthat decision makers are severely restricted in their ability to make these types of \nassessments (e.g. Tversky, 1969, Tversky, 1972, Fishburn 1991). Human beings \nhave limited information processing capacity (Hogarth, 1987) and, when they are \nfaced with such complexity, they resort to simplified mental strategies known as \nheuristics.  The heuristics have been demonstrated to severely constrain decision \nmaking ability even when the extra dimension created by multiple scenarios is not \npresent. For example, when an unaided decision maker who has multiple objectives \nis required to choose a course of action from a restricted set of alternatives, he or \nshe is likely simply to consider the performance on the most important objective and \nignore how well the options perform in relation to the other objectives (the heuristic \nemployed here is known as lexicographic ranking (Tversky, 1969)). Even more \nsophisticated heuristics, such as elimination by aspects (Tversky, 1972) fail to \n 24 \naddress the problem of trade-offs so that the relatively poor performance of a course \nof action on one objective is not compensated, in the decision maker\u201fs assessment, \nby good performance on other objectives. \nO\u201fBrien argues that scenario planning can be classed as a \u201esoft\u201f OR approach \nbecause it has characteristics such as a qualitative analytical component and a \ntendency not to rely on hard data.  She argues that such approaches can foster the \nunderstanding of situations and engender new perspectives of a problem. While we \nagree with these assertions we also see little within scenario planning that can \nsupport participants in their assessment of the performance and robustness of \nstrategies.  \nDecision analysis (Goodwin and Wright, 2004), is designed to provide such \nsupport. Although there is no universal agreement about what constitutes a soft or \nhard OR, and the techniques relating to each approach are best viewed as being on \na continuum between soft and hard extremes (Brown et al., 2006), decision analysis \nis much close to the hard end of the spectrum than scenario planning. Unlike softer \napproaches, it is designed to produce tangible recommendations for action , it has \n\u201etaken for granted\u201f views of what is meant by rationality in option choice and it has a \nprescribed approach to analysis. It also views quantification as being both possible \nand desirable.  \nHowever, decision analysis also has some aspects that are usually associated \nwith soft methods (see Brown et al., 2006, table 1). Its data is usually based on \njudgment and opinion, and it aims to foster shared perceptions amongst groups of \ndecision makers and to support action and learning. Also, its approach to validity is \ncongruent with that of softer methods. In hard OR a model will, as far as possible, be \nvalidated by comparing its predictions to the real world (for example, a simulation \n 25 \nmodel of a bank\u201fs customer queuing system will be validated if it predicts the \nbehaviour of the real system with reasonable accuracy). In decision analysis, where \nthere is unlikely to be an external analogue to allow real world comparison,   \nvalidation is obtained by applying tests such as logical consistency and model \ncredibility. This validation can take the form of requisite modelling (Phillips, 1984) \nwhere: \n\u201cthe modeling process uses the sense of unease among the problem owners about the \nresults of the current model as a signal that further modeling may be needed, or that \nintuition may be wrong. If exploration of the discrepancy between holistic judgment and \nmodel results shows the model to be at fault, then the model is not requisite \u2013 it is not \nyet sufficient to solve the problem. The model can be considered requisite only when no \nnew intuitions emerge about the problem\u201d \nDespite the argument that soft and hard OR are underpinned by fundamentally \ndifferent ontologies (theories and assumption about the world, (Checkland, 1981)) \nwe believe that \u201esofter\u201f scenario planning and \u201eharder\u201f multi attribute decision \nanalysis can bring complementary benefits to the strategic planning process. The \nformer can provide the stimulus to \u201cfuture focussed thinking\u201d (Wright and Goodwin, \n1999) and the latter can enable a thorough appraisal of the strategic options. It can \nachieve this by providing a collection of formal, logical, axiom-based procedures for \nappraising options.  Its approach enables complex problems to be decomposed into \nseparate parts so that the decision maker\u201fs judgment can be focussed, in turn, on \neach relatively simple part.  These decomposed judgments are then aggregated, \nconsistent with the axioms of decision analysis, so that an overall comparison can be \nmade between the options. This approach has been referred to as a \u201edivide and \nconquer\u201f orientation of decision analysis (Keeney, 1982).  \n 26 \nThe notion of combining hard and soft OR approaches is not new. For example, \nMingers and Gill (1997) argue that \u201cusing two or more management science \nmethodologies [multimethodology] in the same intervention is likely to produce a \nricher picture for \"seeing and understanding the complex web of relationships and \ninterconnectivities\" which is likely to lead to better decision taking by managers and \nworkers.\u201d They argue this while still acknowledging the different philosophical \nunderpinning of the various methodologies.  More recently, Brown et al., (2006)) \ndescribe the complementary application of hard and soft methods in a review of the \nBritish personal taxation system. The authors, who used the soft and hard OR in \nparallel, reported that the interaction between the approaches led to a synergy which \nenhanced the understanding and validation of outcomes. \nHow can we exploit the complementary strengths of scenario planning and \ndecision   analysis? While the parallel application of hard and soft methods brought \nbenefits in Brown et al\u201fs (2006) study, we believe that in the strategic planning \ncontext the soft and hard approaches should be used sequentially with the soft \npreceding the hard. There are a number of reasons for this. The focus of \n\u201econventional\u201f decision analysis is on comparing alternative courses of actions that \nare drawn from a restricted set of alternatives, by evaluating outcomes that are \npredicated on these alternatives, Thus the effect of using decision analysis too early \nin the planning process might be to constrain: i) the diversity of possible futures that \ncan be envisaged (e.g. see, Fischhoff et al.s\u2019 (1978) \u201eout of sight, out of mind\u201f \nphenomenon) and ii) the design of novel courses of action that may be superior to \nthose originally considered. Such an approach is likely to reinforce the existing view \nof the world.  Indeed, as a more detailed decision model is developed during the \nanalyst\/decision maker interaction, misplaced confidence in this worldview may be \n 27 \nincreased (Tversky and Kahneman, 1983). In contrast, as we have seen, the prior \nuse of scenario planning should promote alternative views about the nature of the \nfuture and stimulate the subsequent creation of enhanced decision options.  The \nsubsequent use of multi-attribute decision analysis should then enable insightful \nevaluation of strategic options taking into account the full set of identified objectives \nand scenarios (see Goodwin and Wright, 2001, for an example of how this decision \nanalytic approach can be used to complement scenario planning). \n \nOf course, there will be limitations to the decision analysis approach in some \ncontexts. The process of quantitatively evaluating options across different scenarios \nwill be time consuming, especially when the model is revised as managers learn \nmore about the decision problem. Some managers may also have an aversion to \nuse of numbers to measure the performance of options on objectives which are \nqualitative in nature.  Also, the method is likely to require the input of weights to \nreflect the relative importance of the objectives to the decision and some managers \nmay find that assessing the weights is a demanding task. Models are likely to be \nmore acceptable when they are transparent and relatively simple, but such simplicity \ncan usually be only be obtained by approximating the real problem. For example, the \nsimplest models assume than an option\u201fs performance across the objectives can be \nmeasured by using a linear additive scoring rule. Such a rule would preclude \ninteractions between an option\u201fs performances on different objectives. Nevertheless, \nwe emphasise that we propose decision analysis as a method to support strategic \ndecision makers, not to replace them. Its aim is not to produce \u201eoptimal\u201f decisions but \nto foster understanding, insights and creativity and to challenge intuition. This can be \n 28 \noften be achieved by using simple models with known approximations and \nlimitations. \n \n \n4. Conclusion  \n \nIn this paper, we have reprised O\u201f Brien\u201fs identification of pitfalls in teaching \nstudent groups how to develop scenarios and her remedies to overcome these \npitfalls. The pitfalls that she identified were (i) predictability of factor choices, (ii) \npredictability of theme selections (iii) focus on current\/high profile issues, (iv) typical \nimplicit assumptions, and (v) unimaginative presentation.  In addressing these \npitfalls, O\u201fBrien called for three process adaptations, related to: first, critical \nengagement with the centrality of participants\u201f world-views, second, explicit \nexhortation to be \u201emore creative\u201f and , third, offer of supporting mechanisms to \nenhance creativity. In considering both O\u201fBrien\u201fs pitfalls and remedies, we have \noutlined further issues and proposed solutions based upon our own experience in \nteaching and practice. Specifically, we consider that O\u201fBrien\u201fs (2004: 716) attempt to \nmove thinking beyond the myopic and the consideration of the immediate by calling \nupon participants to identify \u201ca minimum of 40 uncertain factors plus a smaller \nnumber of predetermined elements\u201d is constraining upon the very creativity that she \nadvocates. In order to elicit the widest possible range of factors, whilst enabling them \nto be considered in relation to one another without selection and exclusion, we offer \nenhancement of the scenario process framework. In our paper, we have \ndocumented the development of decision-focused, rather than global scenarios, and \nhave argued that such a contextualisation will tend to result in the generation of \n 29 \nscenarios that do not simply anchor on the basic PEST or STEEP dimensions. \nAdditionally, the identification of \u201ccross-disciplinary clusters\u201d and causal linkages \nbetween cluster elements helps to provide a basis for scenario storyline \ndevelopment. A subsequent step in our scenario development methodology was to \nidentify high-impact and low\u2013predictability in the cross-disciplinary cluster headings. \nWe also advocate the use of \u201cremarkable people\u201d and stakeholder analysis to \nenhance scenario development. Also, round-robin elicitation of ideas from members \nof the scenario team aids the creation of scenario storylines. At the same time, \n\u201cknowledge\u201d gained from internet resources should be viewed and interpreted with \nthoughtfulness and vigilance. Whilst accepting O\u201fBrien\u201fs call for greater creativity \nand expansion of the boundaries of thinking in development of scenario stories, we \nconsider that creativity in the story presentation is not, in itself, sufficient, but that \nscenario stories must be seen to be both engaging and plausible, and challenging of \nyet set within the boundaries of possibility. The overall focus of our approach to \nscenario building is thus to create plausible, causally\u2013related storylines that can \nprovoke an \u201corganisation jolt\u201d.  \nFinally, we suggest that it is psychologically difficult to evaluate the \nrobustness of strategy against constructed scenarios in an holistic way. We do not \nsee scenario method as a means of developing and offering stories of what the \nfuture will necessarily be. Rather, we see it as a means of better understanding the \nnature of the present and for offering multiple perspectives on complex \norganizational problems. For this reason, we advocate the use of multi-attribute \nvalue analysis at this, final, stage of scenario development. Such a combination of \n\u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d approaches to decision making in the face of uncertainty provides a \nuseful alternative to the conventional application of decision analysis.  \n 30 \nOur aim in this paper has been to build upon the contribution of O\u201fBrien\u201fs \n(2004) paper on scenario method and to offer some additional insights into both the \npitfalls of the approach and ways in which they might be addressed both in teaching \nand practice. \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nBennett P.G, Huxham C.S,  Hypergames and what they do:  A \u201esoft OR approach\u201f.  \nJournal of the Operational Research Society 1982; 33 (1); 41-50 \nBeech N, Cairns G.

The infection rate of \nAIDS\/HIV in the general population has reached 35%, and is exceeding 40% in the \nworst hit areas. The rate of infection, combined with an increasing \u201ebrain drain\u201f has \nled to acute shortages of education and healthcare professionals. Conflicts which \nwere thought to be close to resolution in 2003 have flared up with renewed vigour, \nand others have erupted, affecting virtually every country in the region, leading to \nwidespread breakdowns in the education system, and overwhelming what medical \nfacilities still exist. \n \nThe move towards the establishment of multi-party democracies across the region in \nthe 1990s has faltered and regressed with increasing levels of conflict and \ncorruption. There is very limited foreign investment, and what does exist is \nexploitative, with none of the revenue remaining in SSA. Recession in the global \neconomic environment has let to large drops in aid funding, and debt has spiralled. \nTrade with an increasingly isolationist and protectionist United States has fallen to an \nall time low, and looks set to fall further. \n \nAt the end of the ten year period, there has been fragmentation of virtually all of the \nmulti-national African organisations, and an explosion in conflict. It is difficult to \nenvisage anything other than a further degradation of health and education. \nAIDS\/HIV infection rates have hit all time highs, endemic diseases such as malaria \nhave re-surged, and the number of children in education has fallen to an all time low. \nThe region as a whole looks to be entering a period driven by conflict and \nlawlessness. Most of the major aid agencies have withdrawn after several instances \nof workers being murdered. \n \nThis summary was followed by a full 2000-word exposition of the scenario storyline, \nwith events, causal relationships, and reference to specific countries, people, etc. \n \nIt should be noted that the full version of this, largely, pessimistic scenario starts with \noptimistic moves: \n- \u201cthe introduction of French peace keeping forces in the Democratic Republic \nof Congo, along with moves towards the establishment of the transnational \ngovernment headed by Joseph Kabila seemed to provide some hope\u2026..\u201d  \nHowever, it moves on to discuss \u201c\u2026the first clashes between French \npeacekeeping forces and local militias in mid June\u2026 was a portent of things \nto come.\u201d Later, \u201cMost of the major aid agencies had long since withdrawn \npersonnel from the region following on from the killings of several International \nRed Cross workers in May 2007.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5: continued \n 38 \n \nSummary of Scenario A2B2 entitled \u201cSelf Help\u201d \n \nIn this scenario, the future is where the region has enjoyed stable governance, \ndespite external global influences not being helpful. The scenario gets its title \nbecause it offered SSA hope of steady progress, albeit on its own terms; in a way, \nrelatively independent of the rest of the world. A recurring theme in this scenario is \nthe empowering of the population, and this will have had to happen via several \ninterrelated threads, whereby society develops in a peaceful, self-sustaining way. \n \nExtracts from main storyline: \n\u201cEven though SSA is enormous, two key events went a long way to generating a \nspirit of optimism that allowed real progress to be made across the region over the \ndecade. The first was the resolution of the political unrest in Zimbabwe at the end of \n2003, and the bedding in of a new government over the following year. The \nsecond\u2026 was the cessation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2026 at \na time when the UN appeared completely powerless, and bogged down with bitter \nrecriminations between the members of its Security Council over the reconstruction \nof post-war Iraq.\u201d \n\u201c\u2026while the African Union was quietly getting on with the business of getting its own \nhouse in order, and re-establishing the rule of law\u2026 the developed world was \nincreasingly preoccupied with its fear of international terrorism, the single issue \nwhich dominated the run-up to the US Presidential elections of 2008.\u201d \n\u201c\u2026particular emphasis was place right away on spending to educate the population \nin birth control and sexual health. Healthy diets and healthy sexual practices were \nalso effectively and vigorously promoted.\u201d \n\u201cDespite the positive, sustainable outcomes that have been outlined so far, it is worth \nconsidering how the development could be regarded as quite fragile. Essentially, it \nhas been dependent on the global community having acted in a benign or neutral \nway to SSA, and it is worth spending some time thinking about what might have \nhappened should there have been global instability and\/or continuing global \neconomic decline.\u201d \n \nIt should be noted that this scenario provides an interesting mix of internal drivers \nwithin SSA , coupled with a dis-interested world beyond. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n*Extracts from scenarios constructed by Strathclyde MBA students: Janyn Tan, \nMoira Kennedy, Jim Brown, Derek Henderson, David Bain and Neil Watson. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 39 \n \n \n"}
