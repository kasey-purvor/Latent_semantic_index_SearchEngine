Introduction \nA number of studies (Carr et al., 1991; Mulla et al., 1992) have examined the potential for \napplying variable rates of fertiliser within fields to improve economic performance and \nminimise environmental impact.  In addition, a range of approaches for determining \nmanagement strategies for applying variable fertiliser have been examined including \ntopography (Nolan et al., 1995); soil sampling with grids (Vetsch et al., 1995); yield maps \n(Kitchen et al., 1995). Other work included the use of remotely sensed canopy reflectance \ndata to monitor the effects of applying nitrogen (Blackmer et al., 1994), and to detect \nnitrogen deficiency (Blackmer et al., 1996). However, no work has been published that \ndevelops the use of optical remote sensing techniques to determine nitrogen requirements or \nto produce nitrogen application maps. A similar technique to optical remote sensing, although \nfundamentally different in terms of implementation \u2013 based on principles of light \ntransmission rather than reflection \u2013 is the use of chlorophyll meters for estimating nitrogen \nrequirements (Chapman & Barreto, 1997). The labour intensive nature of this approach \nwould prohibit its use for commercial precision farming. Unlike remote reflectance \nmeasurements, the chlorophyll meter estimates N concentration and not the total N content. \nA standard recommendation for UK wheat growers has been to sow sufficient seeds to \nproduce 300 plants m-2 by spring based on an average post-winter establishment of 70% \n(HGCA, 1998). Whaley et al. (2000) showed that plant populations in wheat can be lowered \nto 120 plants m-2 and still achieve the same yield, through compensations in increased green \n 4\narea per shoot, extending tillering phase, greater radiation use efficiency and better \npartitioning of resources within the plant. The effect of sowing date on optimum plant \npopulations was reviewed by Spink et al. (2000) who showed that populations could be as \nlow as 62 plants m-2 if sown early in September. \nThis paper reports on the findings of a three year experiment starting in 1996, at four \ncommercial sites with soils representing 30% of land used in arable production in England \nand Wales. Initially, the reasons for the underlying field variation were established prior to \nmanaging the crop in a spatially variable manner (Earl et al., 2003 and Taylor et al., 2003). \nDuring the period 1997-2000 a series of spatially variable management strategies were \ninvestigated and reported by Welsh et al. (2003a and 2003b). The conclusions from these \ninitial studies showed that crop response to nitrogen could vary spatially within fields but was \nhighly dependent on seasonal variations such as rainfall and available water. Variations in \ncrop structure were monitored in near real-time by calibrating airborne digital photography \n(ADP) to provide accurate maps of shoot population. Applying more nitrogen (N) on areas of \nlow initial shoot population, and holding back N on areas of high shoot population produced \nextra yield benefits of up to 0.5 t ha-1 in comparison with standard farm practice. This so-\ncalled \u2018shoot density approach\u2019 offered considerable potential as a basis for varying N rates \nas it takes account of current conditions in the growing crop However, in some years the \nstrategy performed better than in others. This was because \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 shoot population \nwere terms used to express target populations as relative to the field average, which varied \nfrom one season to the next; the strategy needed to be applied within a more robust \nagronomic framework that used \u2018absolute\u2019 rather than \u2018relative\u2019 shoot target values. \nBased on canopy management research by Stokes et al. (1998), the Wheat Growth Guide \nwas published by the HGCA (1998) which provides a set of benchmark targets against which \na wheat crop can be monitored to inform better management towards an optimum canopy \n 5\ngreen area index (GAI). The work reported by Wood et al. (2003) led to the delivery of \naccurate maps of shoot density and GAI from calibrated ADP images to provide a timely \nopportunity for the application of the work by Stokes et al. (1998). An equivalent guide for \nbarley is currently unavailable, although, after a limited three years of data, a better \nunderstanding of shoot population targets in barley has been reached (Welsh et al., 2003a). \nThe objective of the work presented in this paper was to develop and evaluate the \nmanagement of canopy expansion for achieving an economically optimum \u2018canopy size\u2019 for \nyield. Variations in seed rate were used to produce a range of crop structures. Measures of \ncanopy size would be used to plan applications strategies, to determine application rates and \nto monitor the rate of canopy expansion. Remote sensing techniques, developed by Wood et \nal. (2003), were used to provide the canopy measurements. \n \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1. Sites and soils \nThe experiments took place in two commercial field sites in Bedfordshire, UK with \nmedium to heavy clay loams over clay. Onion Field, Houghton Conquest in 1997-98, 1998-\n99 and 1999-2000 (O\/S TL 056 422), predominantly comprises Evesham series, a seasonally \nwaterlogged, swelling clay soil with zones of Oxpasture, a clay loam over clay prone to slight \nseasonal waterlogging; further details of this site can be found in Earl et al. (2003). The other \nfield, Far Highlands, Shuttleworth in 1999-00 (Ordnance Survey reference: TL 135 456) \ncomprises Wickham series with small areas of Evesham series on the hill crests in the south \nand west of the field. Wickham soils are medium to heavy loamy drift over Oxford clay. Both \nfields had been cropped with wheat for several years previously and would remain so for the \nduration of the project.  \n \n 6\n2.2. Experimental design: variable establishment by seed rate \nThis experiment took place in Onion Field in the 1997-98 cropping season and is referred \nto as ON98. The objective of the experiment was to introduce differing plant populations \nthrough varying seed rate on a field scale, and to relate initial establishment to subsequent \nvariation in crop structure and yield components. The variation in compensation would be \nanalysed to determine the potential of varying seed rate as a way of beneficially managing \ninitial crop structure. Observations were made against a background of spatially variable soil \nconditions with uniform, split applications of N fertiliser.  This was complementary to a set \nof field experiments where N rate was varied in order to alter crop structure using a uniform \nseed rate (Welsh et al., 2003a; Welsh et al., 2003b).  \nThe experiment was set out in a series of strips sown with 250, 350 and 450 seeds m-2 of \nwinter wheat (cv. Riband) running orthogonal to the main areas of variation within each field \nas shown in Fig. 1, all subsequently managed conventionally. \n \n2.3. Experimental design: seed rate and N interactions \nThe objective of this experiment was to determine the benefits of controlling crop \nstructure by also varying the rate of fertiliser N to control the growth of the crop towards an \neconomically optimum canopy size. In addition to expected inherent field variation in \nestablishment, different seed rates were again drilled in uniform strips to provide a deliberate \nvariation in initial plant establishment.  The aim was to achieve an optimum GAI by the \nbeginning of anthesis (growth stage GS61). \nExperiments were run over two years: in Onion Field in 1998-99, referred to as ON99, \nwhich was repeated in 1999-2000 (ON00) and shown in Fig. 2. In 1999-2000, the experiment \nwas duplicated in Far Highlands and referred to as FH00 and is shown in Fig. 3. Each field \n 7\nlayout comprised a series of 12m-wide, field-length strips of four different seed rates of 150, \n250, 350 and 450 seeds m-2. \n \nThe standard strips represented \u2018standard farm practice' and received three split-timing, \nuniform applications of N at a rate of 200 kg [N]  ha-1, targeted at mid-to-late tillering (early \nmarch), then at GS31 (April) and again at GS33 (May). The exception to this was in FH00 \nwhen the second application took place at GS30, and not GS31. The variable N applications \nwere also split over the same three timings. Application rates were determined by crop \ncanopy size measured by remote sensing techniques following methodology developed in \nearlier experiments reported in Welsh, et al. (2003b), but developed further along the lines of \nCanopy Management (Stokes et al., 1998).  All other inputs, such as P, K, herbicides and \nfungicides, were applied uniformly by the host farm managers independently of the main \nexperimental work. \n \n2.4. Overview of nitrogen strategy \nAt the timing of each N application, the size of the wheat canopy was measured and \nmapped using airborne digital photographs (ADP) (Wood et al., 2003) to derive calibrated \nmaps of shoot population and GAI. The total amount of N fertiliser to be applied to areas on-\ntarget was determined using rules proposed by Stokes et al. (1998). A worked example is \nprovided in parentheses to illustrate each stage. \n \n(1) Set target GAI (e.g. 6.5). \n(2) Determine the GAI of the current crop (e.g. 0.5).  \n(3) Calculate the additional units of GAI required to achieve the target GAI of 6.5 \n(e.g. 6.5 \u2013 0.5 =  6.0). \n 8\n(4) Assume the crop has a canopy nitrogen requirement (CNR) of 30 kg [N] ha-1 to \nproduce each unit of GAI. \n(5) Determine the total N requirement of the crop to reach the target GAI (e.g. 6.0 x \n30 kg [N] ha-1 = 180 kg [N] ha-1).  \n(6) Determine the soil mineral N supply (e.g. 75 kg [N] ha-1) and deduct from N \nrequirement (e.g. 180 \u2013 75 = 105 kg [N] ha-1). \n(7) Now calculate the total fertiliser N requirement of the crop, assuming that not all \nthe applied N will be recovered (e.g. 40% to 80%). \n(8) Assuming an average recovery rate of applied N (e.g. 60%) calculate fertiliser \nrate (e.g. if 60% of N is recovered, 175 kg [N] ha-1 must be applied to supply 105 \nkg [N] ha-1 to the crop).  \n(9) Apply 40-50 kg [N] ha-1 at the first N timing, and apply the remainder (e.g. 125-\n135 kg [N] ha-1) at the main dose. \n(10) Apply an extra 40 kg [N] ha-1 at the third timing for canopy survival. \n \nThis procedure was developed for uniform applications of N and was applied to areas of \nthe field at the target canopy size. These application were varied when the crop canopy size \nwas above or below target and, in this way, the strategy deviated from the work of Stokes et \nal. 1998). Areas above-target received a reduced (or zero) N dose, and areas below-target \nreceived an increased amount of N. Initially, canopy size was measured by its shoot \npopulation density and then by GAI for the second and third applications. The specific \ntimings are now discussed. \n \n 9\n2.5. First nitrogen application \nThe aim is to achieve a target GAI by GS61, which is a product of the final shoot density \nand the green area per shoot (GAPS). Sylvester-Bradley et al. (2000) showed that fewer \nshoots are required to achieve the same GAI at GS61 in crops with lower initial plant \npopulations because the GAPS is higher than crops with lower plant populations. The \nestimated green area per shoot at GS61 was determined from Eqn 1 (derived from Sylvester-\nBradley et al., 2000) for a given plant population (P). \nG = 154 - 0.2P + 0.0002P2       (1) \n \nThe ultimate number of shoots required to produce the optimum GAI at GS61 was \ndetermined by dividing the target GAI by the GAPS.  By factoring-in the expected shoot \nsurvival (c.50%), the desired shoot population at GS31 was estimated. The first N application \nwas made before tillering was complete and so an estimated percentage-completion of \ntillering was used to adjust the shoot population target for the N application date.  \n \n2.6. Main dose \nFor the second N application at GS31, canopy expansion was managed according to \nvariations in the GAI mapped using ADP techniques. The GAI maps were used to compare \nthe current growth pattern to the target benchmark as set out in the Wheat Growth Guide \n(HGCA, 1998). The main dose was adjusted according to the matrix in Table 1, which takes \ninto account the current canopy-size status and the previous treatment dose rates. \n \n2.7. Final dose \nAn extra 40 kg [N] ha-1 for canopy survival was applied to areas of the field on-target in \nline with canopy management at GS33 (Stokes et al., 1998). Measures of the crop GAI were \n 10\nagain compared to recommended targets as set out in the Wheat Growth Guide, and classified \nas above-target, below-target or on-target accordingly. The third and final \u2018survival\u2019 dose was \nthen adjusted as follows in order to receive the following N treatment: \n(1) if GAI = 5.5 - 7.0 (on-target), a canopy survival dose (40 kg [N] ha-1) was applied; \n(2) if GAI > 7.0, no canopy survival dose was applied; and \n(3) if GAI < 5.5, extra N was applied. \n \n \n2.8. Field measurements \nSampling points were established in four transects in ON98, ON99, and ON00 traversing \nthe experimental strips c.100 m apart as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Plant population was \nmeasured at each of the sampling points (three quadrats per sampling point) along the \ntransects in November and February.  Shoot population (two quadrats per point) and biomass \n(one quadrat) were also assessed at GS30 at each of the sampling points.  Destructive samples \nfor biomass assessments were made at harvest which also provided a sample to measure crop \nheight and the components of yield: ear number, grain number per ear, and thousand grain \nweight (TGW).  Leaf concentrations of N, K, P, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, and S were determined in \nApril by plant tissue analyses. Soil mineral N was assessed in the autumn using a \u2018W\u2019 \nsampling pattern to provide baseline data for the field. In ON99 and ON00 the north-eastern \nand south-western parts of the field were assessed separately. In FH00, the east half of the \nfield was assessed separately to the west. A \u2018W\u2019 sampling pattern was used for each \nindependent assessment. Other soil elements (P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Mn, B, Cu, Mo, Fe and Zn), \npH and organic matter were assessed in both autumn and spring (April).  A \u2018W\u2019 sampling \nstrategy was used in the autumn, whilst soil samples from only selected sampling positions \nwere taken from 0-0.3 m depth in the spring. \n 11\nIn ON99, additional destructive samples, taken 6 m away from the transect sample points \nin the direction of field operations, were processed in the laboratory for biomass, shoot \npopulation, green area per shoot, GAI, and N concentration. These provided the basis for \nmonitoring the effect of managing crop structure with variable N through the season. The \nsame measures were made in FH00, however, the samples were not aligned in transects.  \nSamples were targeted using a remotely sensed image of the crop acquired at GS13.  Unlike \nON98-ON00, routine soil and crop samples on transects were not made in FH00, which was \nincluded as an additional experimental site intended to receive only minimal monitoring in \nline with what was ultimately to be conventional field practice. \nThe ultimate crop response to the different seed rates was assessed in terms of grain yield \nand recorded by harvesting the length of each strip using a Massey Ferguson combine \nharvester equipped with a yield mapping system. Moore (1998) measured the performance of \nthis yield monitor and showed that it underestimated the average yield of a field by \napproximately 20 kg ha-1 with the standard error of individual observations equivalent to 155 \nkg ha-1. \n \n2.9. Remote sensing \nRemotely sensed images were acquired during crop establishment and prior to each N \nfertiliser application. The images served to monitor variation through the season in all fields \nand to direct inputs of variably applied N in ON99, ON00 and FH00. The remotely sensed \ndata was collected using an aerial digital photographic (ADP) system, which comprised two \nKodak DCS420 digital cameras (Graham, 1994) mounted in a light aircraft to provide vertical \nimages in two wavebands. Optical band-pass filters were selected in both the red (R) \nelectromagnetic wavelengths, 640 nm with a half-maximum response of 10.4 nm, and the \nnear-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, 840 nm, with a half-maximum response of 11.7 nm, fitted \n 12\nin front 18 mm lenses of the cameras. The charge coupled device (CCD) camera array \nproduced images made up of 1012 by 1524, 8-bit pixels, with a nominal field-of-view of 500 \nby 750 m. Images were acquired at an altitude of 1000 m, giving a nominal ground resolution \nof 0.5 m. The cameras were exposed for 1\/125 second, at f3.5, and set to an ISO400-\nequivalent film sensitivity. Fired simultaneously using a remote trigger, the digital images \nwere automatically stored on computer disk for processing. \nThe ADP system recorded the red and near-infrared image bands simultaneously on the \ntwo separate camera hard disks. The two wavebands were combined by digitally overlaying \none on the other in ERDAS Imagine (v4.0, ERDAS Inc.) to a root mean square (RMS) error \nof less than 1 m. The red and near-infrared bands were processed into a normalised-\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI) image using Eqn (2): \n \n    INDV = (\u03bbDN840 \u2013 \u03bbDN640) \/ (\u03bbDN840 + \u03bbDN640)         (2) \nwhere: INDV is the normalised difference vegetation index; and \u03bbDN640 and \u03bbDN840 denote the \nuse of digital numbers measured at the red and near infrared spectral wavebands. \n \nThe NDVI was calculated using raw digital number (DN) values, recorded by the sensor, \nrather than transforming the DNs to equivalent radiance values or reflectance (Goward et al., \n1991).  Both methods of calculation lead to different NDVI values. Full radiometric \ncalibration is required for inter-comparisons of NDVI from different sensors and different \nsolar zenith angles.  This work required only the relative differences of the NDVI across \nsingle localised images, individually calibrated with ground observations, so the use of raw \nDN values was appropriate.  \nA methodology for accurately mapping within-field variation of shoot population and GAI \nof wheat, by linear correlation with the NDVI, was used in these experiments which was \n 13\ninitially developed by Taylor et al. (1997) and developed further by Wood et al. (1998 and \n2003). The NDVI images were calibrated to provide maps of continuous estimates of shoot \npopulation across each field prior to each N application date.  \n3. Results \n3.1. Onion Field 1998 \nTable 2 shows the three seed rates resulting in a proportional response of spring plant \npopulations in the range 162-243 plants m-2. On average, shoot populations were typical for \nwheat (HGCA, 1998), and there was no significant increase in the number of shoots m-2 in \nthe canopies above 350 seeds m-2. There were significantly higher numbers of shoots per \nplant at GS31 with reduced seed rate. The average shoot survival was low (32%) leaving the \nnumber of ears at the low end of the target range for winter wheat as described by Sylvester-\nBradley et al. (1997), but not atypical for a continuous wheat.  \n \nMeasurements relating to final yield are shown in Table 2 and were available from two \nsources: (a) hand harvested (HH) samples, supported by measures in yield components, and \n(b) combine harvester (CH) measures. The CH measures were extracted from the raw \ncombine harvester yield data in 20 m long sections, 10 m before and after the transect point \nlocations. This was to encompass positioning error in the global positioning system (GPS) \nlocation and to dampen the effect of the high frequency variations in measurement of the \nyield-recording systems on the combine harvester (Moore, 1998). \n \nDifferences in measured yield can exist between HH and CH samples due to discrepant \nquadrat edge effects in the HH measures, which could be as much as 25% if an additional \nrow is included or excluded, or to a lesser extent, through fewer grains being lost in \ncomparison to the combine harvester leading to marginally higher recorded HH yields \n 14\n(Bloom, 1985). The CH yields are used in the final analysis for three reasons: wheat is \nharvested by commercial growers using similar combine harvesters and so results are directly \ncomparable; the samples are taken from a larger area and less prone to localised variability. \nFinally, when comparing total strip responses, the CH measures represent the complete strip \n'population' with no sampling error - only the yield meter error.  \nThe results of the yield measurements in Table 2 reveal an actual improvement in yield \n(probability p=0.052) from the lowering of seed rates. The CH measurements indicate yields \nincreasing from 6.0 t ha-1 up to 6.5 t ha-1. Table 2 also shows that the yield improvements \nwere directly related to an increase in both the number of grains per ear (p=0.016) and the \nTGW (p=0.136), each compensating for a reduction in ear numbers (p=0.426). Compared to \nthe standard practice of using 350 seeds m-2, a seed rate of 250 seeds m-2 led to a \u00a333 ha-1 \nimprovement in gross margin due to a combination of increased yield and lower seed costs. \nIncreasing the seed rate to 450 seeds m-2 led to a gross margin penalty of -\u00a324 ha-1 (p=0.104) \nthrough yield reductions and increase seed costs. Gross margins were calculated based on a \nseed price from Nix (2000) of \u00a3220 t-1 and a wheat price of \u00a365 t-1. \n \n3.2. Onion Field 1999 \nThe results of from Onion Field in 1998 (ON98) demonstrated the ability to use seed rate \nto introduce variable plant populations in addition to that caused by inherent field variation. \nThe plan in 1999 was to conduct a variable seed rate and N interaction experiment with the \nobjective of manipulating the canopy to achieve an optimum GAI. The results from ON98 \nalso indicate a possible benefit if a further reduction in seed rates were to be included. The \nON99 experimental design included an additional lower rate strip of 150 seeds.m-2. \nTable 3 shows that the four seed rates resulted in range of spring plant populations of 124-\n256 plants m-2. Although the target seed rates were 150, 250, 350 and 450 seed m-2, the actual \n 15\nseed rates were miscalculated during drill calibration, which were estimated to be 180, 300, \n420 and 540 seeds m-2. There was a significant reduction in plant population over the winter, \nespecially at the highest seed rate. Greater reduction in plant survival at the 540 seeds m-2 \nresulted in an establishment of c.50% compared to c.70% at 180 seeds m-2. This was a \nconsequence of severe waterlogging, caused by a failure in the drainage system. The \nwaterlogging also severely restricted crop growth, consequently, the intended \u2018variable\u2019 strips \nreceived a higher, uniform dose at all timings. \n \nTillering was low, especially in comparison to ON98 results, resulting in rather low shoot \npopulations (Table 3). Final ear populations were low, and below 400 ears m-2 at 180 seeds \nm-2. The results in Fig. 4, from the individual transects, showed convoluted interactions \nbetween seed rate and transect position. Because the number of individual observations for \neach combination of seed rate vs. transect-position was small, conclusions relating to transect \npositions must be drawn with due care. \nSeed rate had little effect on final ear populations at the lower N rate (200 kg [N] ha-1). \nHowever, there was a greater trend of increased ear numbers with increased seed rate \n(p=0.095) where more N was applied (245 kg [N] ha-1). Transect 2, which was most affected \nby waterlogging, showed the most obvious increase in shoot and ear populations \ncorresponding to seed rate, and the least difference due to N. Transect 1 had the highest ear \npopulations (Fig. 8a). It also had the highest shoot count, the highest biomass at both GS30 \nand harvest, and gave the highest TGWs.  Soil analysis revealed consistently higher levels of \nP, K, Mn, Cu and Zn in Transect 1, and this was reflected, although to a lesser extent, in \ntissue levels of P, Cu and Zn. \nGrains per ear decreased with increased seed rate in all transects. Transect 1 generally had \nthe lowest grains per ear, and also showed the least differences between seed rates, especially \n 16\nat the higher N rate (Fig. 8b). Field locations with the lowest ear numbers appeared to \nrespond with higher numbers of grains per ear. There was also a greater range in \ncompensation of grains-per-ear where ear numbers were more uniform. It was difficult to \nidentify any clear patterns by transect in TGW. \nHarvest measurements did not show a clear relationship between seed rate and final yield \n(Table 4). At the standard application rate of N, 200 kg [N] ha-1, the highest yields were \nachieved at 180 seeds m-2 and 420 seeds m-2, and lower yields at 300 seeds m-2 and 540 seeds \nm-2.  Although the effect of seed rate is inconclusive, the application of extra N (245 kg [N] \nha-1) appears to have had two effects relating to whether it was applied to the low yielding \nstrips or to the high yielding strips. In the higher yielding strips (180 and 420 seeds m-2) the \neffect was to maintain yield or to reduce it by 0.5 t ha-1. In the relatively lower yielding strips \n(300 and 540 seeds m-2) the application of extra N corresponded to an increase in yield by up \nto 1.5 t ha-1. This pattern was observed in all measures of yield: HH measures, complete CH \nstrip averages, or CH averages taken at the transect positions. The low yielding areas \ncorresponded to lower ear populations. The application of extra N corresponded to a higher \nnumber of ears, but not to an increase in grain numbers per ear. \nWhere the standard rate of N was applied, the lower seed rate strips produced yields that \nwere better than or equal to the highest seed rates strips; the highest gross margin was \nachieved at the lowest seed rate due to a combination of an improvement in yield and \nassociated reduced seed cost. Conversely, the addition of extra N corresponded to the highest \nyield at the highest seed rate, where the yield benefit outweighed the additional cost of extra \nseed and produced the highest gross margin (Table 4). \nYield measurements showed no differences between transect positions with the exception \nof Transect 2 where the lowest seed rate produced the lowest yields (Fig. 8d). Dropping the \n 17\nseed rate uniformly - although the better option in 3 out of 4 transects - led to a 3 t ha-1 \nreduction in yield in Transect 2. \n \n3.3. Onion Field 2000 \nAt all four seed rates, modest establishment (c.65%) resulted in a range of plant \npopulations of 95 to 224 plants m-2 (Table 5).  To determine the required number of shoots to \nproduce a canopy GAI of 7.0 at anthesis (GS61), an estimate of the green area per shoot \n(GAPS) was calculated using Eqn 1. For the purposes of calculating the target shoot numbers \nfor the first N application, an estimate of shoot survival was used. Earlier results showed that \nshoot survival increases with decreasing plant numbers, created by varying seed rate. \nHowever, a stable rate had not been observed as the measured survival rates also varied \nbetween seasons from 30-35% in ON98 to 50-75% in ON99. As such, an average shoot \nsurvival range of 45-50%, for the highest to lowest seed rate, respectively, was adopted based \non work reported by Sylvester-Bradley et al. (1997). \nField observations provided an estimate of the percentage completion of the tillering \nphase, which was determined to be 95% complete, and assumed equal for all seed rates. \nTable 6 summarises the derivation of target shoot populations required at the first N timing \nfor the four initial seed rates in order to achieve the GAI of 7.0 by GS61.  \n \nAn ADP image was acquired on 5th March, followed by ground survey on the 13th March, \nand calibrated to produce the shoot population map shown in Fig. 5a.  Since each seed rate \nresulted in different GS31 target shoot populations (Table 6), each seed rate strip required a \nseparate classification. Figure 5b shows the resulting shoot map classified into \u2018below target\u2019, \n\u2018on-target\u2019, and \u2018above-target\u2019, based on whether they were below 60%, between 60%-95%, \nor greater than 95% of the respective GS31 shoot targets. No significant part of the field \n 18\nexceeded the 13th March target population which was generally below target.  On this basis \nthe field received either a standard dose of fertiliser N, if on-target, or an increased dose if \nbelow target as shown in the schematic treatment map illustrated in Fig. 6a. Although soil N \ntests in February gave values for available N ranging between 36 and 165 kg [N] ha-1, there \nwas no pattern, therefore, the field average of 72 kg [N] ha-1 was used. \nFor the second N application on the 29th April, an ADP image was acquired on 7th April, \nfollowed by the ground survey on the 17th April when the field was at the beginning of stem \nextension (GS31). Figure 7a shows a large proportion of the field below-target with a GAI in \nthe range of 0.5-1.5.  At the first application, these same areas received an increased dose \nand, therefore, in accordance with Table 1, now received a scheduled on-target dose. Areas \non-target, with a GAI of 1.5-2.0, received a standard dose if they had received a standard \ndose at the first application timing, otherwise they received a reduced dose if the earlier dose \nwas an increased dose. \nThe third N application was on 24th May, when the crop was at GS35. The final calibrated \nADP image, shown in Fig. 7b, estimated a significant area of the field was below the GAI \nthreshold of 5.5 and was given extra N. The north-eastern edge of the field was above target \nand received zero N as shown in Fig. 6c.  Table 7 summarises the N rates applied at each \ntiming. \n \nThe results from the harvest show that the variable-rate N application strategy produced \n0.53 t ha-1 more grain on average for all seed rates in comparison to the uniform standard \napplication strategy (Table 8). Unlike the earlier experiments, the greatest yield was achieved \nwith variable N at the highest seed rate of 450 seeds m-2, and not the lowest. The amount of \nvariably applied N (192 kg [N] ha-1) required to achieve this maximum yield was essentially \nthe same as the standard rate (200 kg [N] ha-1). The increase in yield corresponded directly to \n 19\nthe re-distribution of N varied spatially along the strip. At the lower seed rates, the adopted \nvariable N strategy led to a greater amount of N being added (Table 8). Consequently, the \nincrease in N cost and the corresponding smaller increase in yield led to a relatively smaller \ngross margin benefit, although the improvement in yield by varying N at all seed rates \noutweighed the cost of N. This led to a range in gross margin benefit of \u00a317 ha-1 to \u00a360 ha-1, \nfor 150 to 450 seed m-2, respectively (derived from Table 8). \n \n3.4. Far Highlands 2000 \nPlant establishment was high and in the range 71% to 80% for the four seed rates, 150 to \n450 seeds m-2, with autumn plant counts of 120 to 320 plants m-2, respectively, as shown in \nTable 9, which also summarises the derivation of shoot targets required to achieve a GAI of \n6.5 at GS61.  \nAn ADP image was acquired on the 5th March, followed by ground survey on the 7th \nMarch. Figure 8a represents the calibrated ADP image processed to indicate shoot density at \nthe time of the 1st N application. \n \nThe second ADP image shown in Fig. 9 was taken on 11th April when the crop was at \nGS30. The presence of broad-leaved weeds precluded the successful calibration of this \nimage. This is because all actively growing vegetation contributes to the flux of reflected \nlight from the crop canopy.  It is impossible, with the two-band ADP system, to separate the \ncombined effect on reflectance of the weed and the crop. However, the data from the ground \ncalibration exercise was used to provide an indication of the current GAI, which was 1.3 and \non-target for GS30. Consequently, and since no accurate map of spatial variation in GAI was \navailable, the majority of the field received a uniform 'standard' dose rate of 90 kg [N]  ha-1, \n 20\nexcept for a small waterlogged area in the centre of the field shown in Fig. 9b. The \napplication took place on the 2nd May. \nFor the third N application, on 25th May, the ADP image shown in Fig. 10a was acquired. \nBroad-leaved weeds were still present and, although now controlled and dying back, an \nextensive ground survey was undertaken to \u2018replace\u2019 the image and provide sufficient data to \nenable the N management strategy to be completed fully. A total of 144 individual quadrat \nobservations were made in the field. The high number of field observations required to \nreplace the image data would prohibit this same approach from being used practically on the \nfarm, but highlighted the need for effective weed management where a remotely sensed \nimage of crop growth is to be used. The image was used to visually interpret whether the \nsamples were representative of the broader area from which they were taken.  \nThe combine harvest (CH) yield results in Table 10 show that the variable rate N \napplication strategy produced very similar, although marginally lower, yields on average to \nthe standard, uniform approach. The average yield difference was less than 0.1 t ha-1. The \nhighest yield was achieved at the lowest seed rate, with the variable outperforming the \nstandard strips by 0.3 t ha-1. This improvement was achieved using effectively the same \namount of total N as applied in the standard, as observed for the highest yield strips in ON00.  \nTable 11 presents achieved green area per shoot (GAPS) sizes from GS29 through to the \ntarget timing at GS61 (compare to Table 9). In the standard N application strips, the GAPS \ndid not strongly relate to seed rate or initial plant population, and exceeded the target. The \nGAPS in the variable application strips more closely fitted the expected decline in GAPS \nwith increasing autumn plant population. \nWhilst the variable application strategy performed marginally worse than the standard, in \nthree out of the four seed rates, the total amount of applied N was lower, particularly in 350 \nand 450 seed rate strips. This led to the variable N strategy producing marginally higher gross \n 21\nmargins of \u00a320 ha-1, \u00a32 ha -1 and \u00a310 ha-1 in the 150, 350 and 450 seeds m-2 strips. The 250 \nseeds m-2 strip lost \u00a31 ha-1.  \n \n3.5. Environmental implications \nWhilst this project did not specifically address the environmental implications of variable \nnitrogen application it is possible to draw some conclusions on the potential impact of \nprecision farming decisions on the nitrogen balance in the environment. \nIt was possible to calculate the potential offtake of nitrogen in the variable treatment \ncompared to the standards for each seed rate in Onion Field, 2000 (Table 12) using the strip \nmean grain yields, grain and straw nitrogen content, and average fertiliser N application rate \nmeasured in the quadrate samples, and assuming a straw yield equal to 65% of grain yield. In \nthe lowest seed rate, which produced only 100 plants m-2, both the uniform and variable \nnitrogen programmes had nitrogen offtakes which were significantly less than the amount \napplied, resulting in a surplus at the end of the season. At the two highest seed rates the off-\ntakes from the variable N applications were higher than applied N resulting in a net reduction \nin N balances (similar measures were not made in Far Highlands and, so, cannot be reported). \nAveraged over the four seed rates, the N surplus for the variable treatments was 18.5 kg [N]  \nha-1 compared to 28 kg [N]  ha-1 for the uniform treatments.  This represents a 34% reduction \nin the net amount of residual N in the soil from the variable application. This could have \nconsiderable longer term environmental significance. \n \n4. Discussion \nVarying seed rate led to a directly proportional response in plant and shoot populations in \nboth fields in all years. However, plant and shoot populations obtained from equivalent seed \nrates differed substantially between years and between fields. Directly compensating for the \n 22\nlarge variation in shoot production, shoot survival compensated to produce ear populations \nthat were consistently in the range 350-550 ears m-2 in all years in Onion Field (ON98-00). \nShoot survival was consistently higher at lower shoot populations in all cases. Although still \napparent, the effect of seed rate on final ear populations was small. In FH00, the range in seed \nrate response on initial plant population, shoot production and survival was much greater than \nin ON98-00. In summary, ON98 had good plant establishment, produced the highest shoot \npopulations with low shoot survival (31-35%); ON99 had higher plant populations but \nproduced the lowest shoot populations and maintained a high shoot survival (55-72%). In \nON00, plant establishment and shoot production were moderate with high shoot survival (62-\n71%).  FH00 had good establishment, a high rate of shoot production and shoot survival and \nthe greatest range (45-81%). Although smaller, the effect of the different varieties would \nhave had an impact on shoot production and survival. Results imply that seasonal factors had \na bigger impact on crop structure than seed rate.  \nThe results highlighted the potential to alter the crop structure to the benefit of final yield. \nThe higher seed rates resulted in a greater tiller mortality rate than at the lower seed rates, \nwhich would indicate a greater level of inefficiency, although some N and carbohydrate may \nbe translocated from the dying tillers (Lupton & Pinthus, 1969). Lowering seed rates resulted \nin a more efficient crop structure, greater yields and improved gross margin benefits.   \nCompensation for the reduced plant population due to reduced seed rate was expected in \nthe green area per shoot (GAPS). This pattern was observed more clearly in the variable N \napplication strips, but not in the standard. This indicates that the variable N management was \nsuccessful in managing the canopy size components towards the optimum, although the final \nGAPS exceeded the target.  \nRemarkably, the number of grains m-2 were relatively similar for all seed rates in all years, \nc.20000, with TGW generally falling in relation to increased seed rate and, consequently, \n 23\nplant\/shoot populations. Lowering seed rates to below the standard practice benefited the \ngrower by \u00a333 ha-1 in ON98 through lower seed costs and an extra 0.3 t ha-1 yield. Moving to \nhigher seed rates led to a net loss (-\u00a324 ha-1). \nIn ON99, the extra, uniform rate of 245 kg [N] ha-1 compared to the standard 200 kg [N] \nha-1 corresponded to a greater number of shoots per plant. However, the initial plant \npopulations prior to N application were already higher in the \u2018245 kg [N]  ha-1 strip, therefore, \nconclusions regarding the effect of N on shoot population should be drawn carefully from \nthis.  \nFinal yields in ON99 were unusual due to isolated areas of severe waterlogging showing \nan irregular response to seed rate. In areas similar to the 150 seed rate in Transect 2, the best \nmanagement combination would appear to have been to increase seed rate to 450 seed m-2 \nand to increase the levels of N above the standard rate to 245 kg [N] ha-1. By dropping to the \nlowest seed rate, which produced the best yields in all other transects, there was a \nconsiderable yield penalty of c.3 t ha-1 and lost profit of \u00a3180 ha-1. This area of waterlogging \nrepresented 20% of the total field area, i.e. a total missed benefit of up to \u00a3500.  \nThe results from 2000 show benefits from this approach over and above standard uniform \nproduction practices.  Variable N application could prove to be a realistic prospect for the \nfuture of cereal farming.  \nThe ADP data were successfully collected and ground calibration was completed \nefficiently to provide accurate, near real-time shoot density maps and GAI maps (Wood et \nal., 2003). However, as in all areas of precision farming strategies, the common problems \nfacing the grower, e.g. weeds and drainage, which caused problems in the experiments, pest \nand diseases, must first be managed effectively before the benefits of precision management \ncan be realised (Godwin et al., 2003). Better general management is also essential for the \n 24\nintegration of remote sensing technologies into the farm management system \u2013 particularly to \navoid weed infestation, which interferes with the crop reflectance signal.  \nThe first objective to managing the canopy was to control shoot development. Given the \ndifferent initial plant populations in ON00 and FH00 the final shoot density required to \nachieve the target GAI was estimated objectively. The results from the standard strips show \nthat, when uncorrected by N the final ear population compensated to within c.100 ears m-2 of \nthe optimal densities for light interception as proposed by Stokes et al. (1998).  Moreover, the \nintervention through N management tended the crop structure much closer to this optimum.  \nIn FH00 the difference between the standard and the variable strips was much less, although \nthe variable strip always tended closer towards the optimum, as shown Table 11. \nThere was a tendency for greater levels of N to be applied with decreasing seed rate over \nand above the standard rate. This was because, by the third N application, ON00 was below \ntarget in parts of the field. At the lower seed rates greater portions of the strips were below \ntarget compared with higher seed rates \u2013 c.90% of the 150 seed rate strip was below target. \nThese areas received extra N.  This was similar for FH00. However, due to better \nestablishment in FH00, the relative amounts of applied N compared to the standard were the \nopposite in ON99: the higher seed rates strips were over-target and received zero N in places. \nAgain, the tendency here was for greater levels of N being applied with decreasing seed rate. \n \nWhere the crop tended to be over-target during canopy expansion \u2013 corresponding to \u2018total \napplied N\u2019 values that were considerably less than the standard \u2013 there was a penalty in yield. \nTypically, the crop produced better or equivalent yields from variably applied N. The \nfollowing effects on gross margin can be noted: \n \n 25\nThe highest gross margins were achieved where the total applied N was similar to the \nstandard: \u00a360 ha-1 in ON00 at 450 seeds m-2; and \u00a320 ha-1 in FH00 at 150 seeds m-2. \nIn FH00 the final yields were very similar, c.7.9 t ha-1, at all seed rates in both the standard \nand variable strips. However, the amount of N required to acheived this yield varied \nconsiderably, especially in the 350 and 450 seeds m-2 strips.  Except at the lowest seed rate, \nthe gross margins for the variable N strips were very similar to their correspoding standard. \nAlthough N fertiliser costs were greater at the lower seed rates in ON00, the positive effect \non yield meant that yield benefits outweighed seed and N costs by \u00a317 ha-1 in the 150 seeds \nm-2 strip, and by \u00a338 ha-1 in the 250 seeds m-2 strip. \n \n \n5. Conclusions \nIn order to manage a canopy effectively, an accurate and timely measure of canopy size is \nrequired. Aerial digital photography techniques provided an accurate and timely method for \nassessing canopy size at the three N application dates during the period from mid tillering to \nthe end of stem extension. The airborne remote sensing technique is suitable for adoption \ncommercially at an economic rate. \nVariations in seed rate led to proportional variations in plant density. Underlying soil \nvariation also affected establishment and, thus, contributed to variations in plant density. \nLowering seed rate below standard farm practice led to marginally higher numbers of tillers \nper plant and higher shoot survival. From different initial plant populations, the wheat \ncompensated and tended final ear populations towards a similar density relative to maximum \nshoot populations at growth stage GS30.  \nVariable rate applications of N based upon real-time assessments of canopy size was \nsuccessful in increasing the gross margin for all four seed rates in Onion Field and for two \n 26\nout of four in Far Highlands Field with the remaining two being effectively the same as the \nstandard approach to within \u00a31-2 ha-1.  \nThe highest gross margins came from variable strips where the total amount of applied N \nwas similar to the standard, indicating a more efficient use of N when targeted according to \nreal-time measures of canopy size. \nGreater or equivalent yields were achieved by the variable N strategy. However, yields \nwere lower than the standard in strips where the total amount of N was significantly reduced \nin an attempt to \u2018hold back\u2019 over-sized canopies. However, even in these situations the gross \nmargins exceeded those achieved through the standard application of N because of lower \nfertiliser costs and only small associated yield penalties. \nAt all four seed rates in Onion Field, the variable N strategy out-performed the uniform \napplications, increasing the gross margins by up to an extra \u00a360 ha-1. In Far Highlands Field, \nthe variable application outperformed the uniform, in three out of four seed rates, by up to \n\u00a320 ha-1. The strips where the standard produced higher returns only managed an \nimprovement of \u00a31 ha-1. \nConsidering the environmental implications, a simple nitrogen balance calculation showed \nthat in addition to an increase in yield, the spatially variable application of nitrogen can have \nan overall effect of reducing the nitrogen surplus by approximately one third. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the sponsors of this work, Home Grown Cereals \nAuthority, Hydro-Agri and AGCO Ltd., for their support, and their collaborators, Arable \nResearch Centres and Shuttleworth Farms.
