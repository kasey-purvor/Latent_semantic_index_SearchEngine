Among marine vertebrates, seabirds have received\na greater level of attention, possibly because they are\nground nesting and usually easy to manipulate and to\nrecapture (e.g. Wilson et al. 2002). However, most seabird\ntracking data have been gathered during the breeding\nperiod, when animals are tightly linked to their breeding\nsite in order to provision their offspring (e.g. Trathan et al.\n2006, Weimerskirch 2007). Consequently, our knowledge\nabout their habitat usage outside the breeding period is\nvery limited. Moreover, since these animals spend a\nsubstantial part of their life not linked to a central place,\nincluding during juvenile periods and during interbreeding\nlife-cycle phases, filling this gap is a priority for\ninvestigation (e.g. Gre\u00b4millet et al. 2000, Phillips et al.\n2005, 2006, Bost et al. 2009). Outside the breeding period,\nseabirds are very much less constrained in space and time,\nand no longer behave as central place foraging animals\n(Croxall et al. 2005, Bost et al. 2009). Free from breeding\nconstraints, such animals may therefore reach other areas.\nHowever, differences in habitat selection during the\ndifferent periods remain poorly documented (Gre\u00b4millet\net al. 2000, Phillips et al. 2006).\nIn this study we investigated the habitat selections made\nby two marine predators breeding on the Iles Kerguelen, in\nthe southern Indian Ocean. This archipelago is surrounded\nby a large peri-insular submarine plateau that offers a\nrange of habitats (from shallow productive areas over\nthe plateau, to the steep shelf slopes and outer abyssal\nplains) to the abundant and diverse community of seabirds\nthat breed on the islands (Weimerskirch et al. 1988).\nAmong this community, penguins (Spheniscidae) are a\nkey group. These diving seabirds represent c. 90% of\nthe Southern Ocean\u2019s bird biomass and consume several\nmillion tons of marine resources annually (Williams\n1995). The foraging range of penguins is constrained\nby their relatively slow travelling mode (submerged\nswimming and porpoising), which strongly limits their\ndispersal from the colony, in comparison with flying\nseabirds. Moreover, this group includes species that have\ncontrasted foraging strategies, for example the macaroni\nEudyptes chrysolophus Brandt and the gentoo Pygoscelis\npapua Forster penguins (Mori & Boyd 2004), two species\nthat breed at Kerguelen.\n117\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 14 Nov 2013 IP address: 194.66.0.114\nOur main objectives were to determine whether habitat\nuse in the interbreeding period predicted habitat use during\nthe breeding period, and whether the constraints imposed by\nbreeding lead individuals to forage in the nearest suitable\nhabitat. To accomplish this, we assessed habitat selection of\nmacaroni and gentoo penguins in both periods. These are\nideal species to compare, since they have contrasting life\nhistory patterns: the macaroni is a pelagic predator (diving\ntypically to 40m) while the gentoo generally forages closer\nto shore and has deeper diving capabilities (Mori & Boyd\n2004, Tanton et al. 2004, Bost et al. 2009). We hypothesized\nthat the habitat selected outside the breeding period would\nbetter inform our understanding of each species preferred\nforaging habitat than during the breeding period, due to the\nrelease of constraints associated with offspring and greater\ntime availability. We made the prediction that habitat\nselection by breeding penguins is highly correlated with\nhabitat selection by penguins during the interbreeding\nperiod, but over a much smaller area.\nIn order to test these predictions, we compared the\nmovements of remotely tracked animals during and outside\nthe breeding periods (Gre\u00b4millet et al. 2000, Phillips et al.\n2006). We modelled the habitat selected outside the\nbreeding period, then applied this model to the area that\nwas theoretically within the range of breeding birds.\nFinally, we compared the model predictions with the\nactual tracks of the breeding individuals to infer whether\nthe latter behave similarly to non-breeding animals with a\nsmaller foraging range.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy models\nMacaroni penguins have the greatest prey biomass\nconsumption of any seabird species in the world (Brooke\n2004) and they are also the most numerous penguin species\nwith 11.8 million breeding pairs worldwide (Woehler 1993).\nMacaroni penguins are a specialist predator, targeting\nsmall, swarming pelagic prey (mainly crustaceans), but\nalso myctophid fish, especially in the Kerguelen region\n(Deagle et al. 2008). Gentoo penguins are one of the most\nwidespread penguin species in the southern oceans and are\none of the main avian benthic consumers of the sub-\nAntarctic (e.g. Croxall & Prince 1980). Interestingly, gentoo\npenguins\u2019 ecology from neighbouring localities on Kerguelen\nmay reflect the whole range of variation of the species with\nrespect to foraging behaviour and diet (Lescroe\u00a8l et al. 2004,\nLescroe\u00a8l & Bost 2005).\nRemote tracking of the animals\nFor macaroni penguins, our investigation of habitat use\noutside the breeding period was based on the interbreeding\nmigration of 12 animals tracked using light-based\ngeolocation methods (GLS) in 2006 (see Bost et al. 2009\nfor further details on the loggers used and attachment\nmethods). Spatial accuracy of locations obtained with GLS\ntechnique is expected to be from tens to hundreds of\nkilometres (Wilson et al. 2002). Data on the breeding\nperiod were obtained between December 2000 and January\n2001 during the chick-brooding stage, when males need to\nreplenish their energetic reserves at sea after a prolonged\nfasting period ashore of about 39 days (Stahl et al. 1985).\nThree breeding males were instrumented with ARGOS\nPlatform Terminal Transmitters (PTTs, Kiwisats 101, 45\nsec transmission rate). The PTTs were fitted medially to the\nlower back to reduce drag, and fixed to the back feathers\nusing cyanoacrylate glue (Loctite 401) and secured cable\nties. Devices represented 1.9% of body mass and 2.7%\nof the bird\u2019s cross-sectional area (Williams 1995). PTTs\nprovide locations with an accuracy that can be better than\none kilometre (for the classes of location coded 3, 2 & 1,\nsee review in Wilson et al. 2002). Both PTTs and GLSs\nwere deployed at the same colony: Cape Cotter, on the\nKerguelen mainland (Fig. 1).\nHabitat use by gentoo penguins outside their breeding\nperiod was investigated using dispersing juveniles. Though\nthese birds may have been less experienced at foraging than\nadults, we consider that their habitat selection was probably\nrepresentative of other demographic categories, as our\nstudy birds clearly had to make choices between available\nhabitats during the periods they carried the devices. We\nequipped six birds with ARGOS PTTs (Kiwisats 202, 45\nsec transmission rate) between January and March 2008 on\nthe Kerguelen mainland; three individuals were tracked\nfrom the Estacade colony, a site facing eastwards to the\nopen sea, and three from Pointe Denis, within the Golfe du\nMorbihan. These devices were programmed to transmit for\nFig. 1. Map showing the location of Iles Kerguelen and Heard\nIsland on the Kerguelen Plateau. Isobaths for 200, 500, 1000\nand 2000m are shown.

A haulout timer was set to activate\nafter 12 hours continuously dry. They were attached in the\nsame manner as for breeding macaroni penguins, and\nrepresented 1.7% of body mass and 3.8% of the bird\u2019s\ncross-sectional area. Habitat use by gentoo penguins during the\nbreeding period was investigated through 11 adults tracked\nwith PTTs between September and October 2002 (eight\nindividuals from Estacade colony and three from Longue\nIsland, in the Golfe du Morbihan). These animals were\nincubating eggs (n58, with five of them from Estacade and\nthree from the Golfe du Morbihan) or brooding young chicks\n(n53, all from Estacade). These results have been published\npreviously (see Lescroe\u00a8l & Bost 2005, who also provide\ndetails about the loggers used and the attachment methods).\nFor both species, data collection during breeding and\nnon-breeding periods could not take place during the same\nyear due to logistic constraints. As tracking datasets\npotentially reflect unique ecological conditions within a\ngiven year at a given locality, we ensured that the non-\nbreeding periods were not investigated during times of\nmarked local thermal anomalies (sea surface temperature\nanomalies data from the NASA\u2019s POET-PO.DAAC website\nhttp:\/\/poet.jpl.nasa.gov\/, accessed September 2010). For the\nbreeding periods investigated, we felt confident that thermal\nanomaly was a small concern, since previous studies showed\nconsistent at-sea trips patterns among seven consecutive\nyears for breeding macaroni penguins (Trathan et al. 2006).\nHabitat selection analysis\nWe considered that a suitable habitat comprised a\ncombination of environmental factors that was favourable\nto the study animals (Guisan & Zimmermann 2000). Here,\nwe used environmental variables that were: a) available\nfor all tracking data (year, season, locality, scale), and\nb) thought to have a large and contrasting influence on\nforaging behaviour for each species. Given previous\ninformation about the respective foraging strategies of the\ntwo species (Mori & Boyd 2004, Lescroe\u00a8l & Bost 2005,\nDeagle et al. 2008), we focused on bathymetry, bathymetry\ngradient and distance to the colony. The use of the distance\nto the colony allowed us to measure the difference of\nspatial scale of the movement according to the level of time\nconstraint (from days, during the breeding period, to\nmonths or maybe years outside the breeding period). The\nspatial grids used for the model inputs and outputs were\n0.18 (c. 10 km) for macaroni penguins, and 0.0338 (c. 3 km)\nfor gentoo penguins, to take into account that different\ndevices were used to track the individuals outside the\nbreeding period. The spatial resolution of the model\npredictions for the breeding period, were therefore\ndependent on the accuracy of the model\u2019s inputs.\nBefore analysing animal movements, ARGOS locations\nwere filtered using the \u2018sdafilter\u2019 function of R package\n\u2018argosfilter\u2019 based on speed and spikes along the observed\ntrack. Specific speed thresholds used were 7.5 km h-1\nfor macaroni (Brown 1987) and 7.2 km h-1 for gentoo\n(Robinson & Hindell 1996) penguins. Filtering locations\nensured that their accuracy adequately fitted into the spatial\nscale used for the model. Because we were unable to know\nthe precise location of selected foraging places, or the\nsuccess of the animals in these places, we used all the\nfiltered locations in the habitat selection analysis, including\nthe travelling parts of the trips. Due to the irregular nature\nof ARGOS locations, we also used a linear interpolation\nof the track (once every hour) to avoid over-sampling in\nthe models for areas where many locations were produced.\nLight-based geolocation data were approximately constant,\nwith one location produced each 12 hours (see Wilson\net al. 2002 for a review).\nFinally, we used a habitat suitability model to understand\nhabitat selection outside the breeding period. Modelled habitat\nselection criteria were then applied within the theoretical\nforaging ambit of animals during the breeding period. Thus,\nwe predicted favourable areas for breeding animals, based on\nknowledge gained from non-breeding animals and under the\nassumption that their preferred habitat was constant within\n(macaroni penguins and gentoo penguins) and between\n(gentoo penguins inside the Golfe du Morbihan) colonies.\nWe used Mahalanobis distances factor analysis (MADIFA,\nCalenge et al. 2008), a method developed to build habitat\nsuitability maps from presence-only data, such as tracking\ndata. The Mahalanobis distance is a commonly used\nenvironmental suitability index (see Calenge et al. 2008 and\nreferences therein) that expresses the distance between each\navailable point on a map (defined by a set of environmental\nvariables) and the mean of the ecological niche (supposed to\nreflect the environmental optimum for the studied species).\nFor all points on the map, the MADIFA partitions the\necological space into a set of axes by the means of two\nsuccessive principal components analyses (PCAs), so that the\nfirst axis maximises the average proportion of their squared\nMahalanobis distances. The first PCA returns the directions\npartitioning the variance of standardized niche into orthogonal\ncomponents. Then, the correlation structure is removed by\nrescaling the variance of all axes to one, and a second PCA\nperformed on this new matrix returns linear combinations of\nthe environmental variables so that the width of the niche is\nthe smallest in comparison to the width of the cloud of\navailable points (Calenge et al. 2008). Among the different\nmethods available for the description of the ecological niche,\nwe chose the MADIFA because it takes into account the\nenvironmental availability on the area where the niche was\nsampled, and consequently may provide better predictive\naccuracy (for a comparison of the results given by six\npresence-only data methods see Tsoar et al. 2007). This\nmethod is also convenient to use because it is easily available\nand implemented, runs on a free software, and finally because\nit is complementary to the commonly used ecological-niche\nfactor analysis (ENFA). For all analyses we used R 2.9.0\nHABITAT SELECTION BY PENGUINS 119\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 14 Nov 2013 IP address: 194.66.0.114\n(R Development Core Team 2009) and additional packages\n\u2018adehabitat\u2019, \u2018sp\u2019, and \u2018trip\u2019.\nTo perform the MADIFA we needed to define spatially\nthe \u2018available environment\u2019 considered for non-breeding\nanimals. We selected the latitudinal range they travelled in,\nbut extended the longitudinal boundaries of their observed\ndispersion to their maximal range plotted in both directions.\nDuring the breeding period, we defined the maximal\ntheoretical foraging range for birds using time budget\ninformation (Williams 1995), speed (Brown 1987, Robinson\n& Hindell 1996) and the proportion of time spent travelling\n(38%, Brown 1987). As there were apparent differences in\nhabitat targeted by gentoo penguins from the different\nlocalities (open ocean compared to Golfe du Morbihan, see\nalso Lescroe\u00a8l & Bost 2005), habitat suitability was modelled\nseparately between localities.\nResults\nMovements of animals\nOn average, macaroni penguins left their colony for their\ninterbreeding migration on 19 April \u00b1 14 days, and returned\nsix months later, on 24 October \u00b1 6 days. All birds migrated\nin a similar direction, moving eastwards away from their\ncolony over the open ocean beyond the shelf. They remained\nin this habitat during the whole interbreeding period. During\nthe brood period, trips made by males lasted 16 days\non average: individuals left their nests on approximately 2\nJanuary and returned around 17 January. Movements were\ngenerally eastwards and all birds reached oceanic areas\nbeyond the Kerguelen Plateau, over depths of 2000m\n(Fig. 2). Table I shows that the much longer duration of\nthe interbreeding trips compared to the brooding trips\n(188.8 \u00b1 14.8 vs 16.6 \u00b1 3.8 days, respectively, Wilcoxon\nrank sum test, W5 0, P, 0.01) was associated with a much\ngreater maximum range (2416 \u00b1 1008 vs 356 \u00b1 120 km,\nWelch two sample t-test, t5 -6.888, df5 12.065, P, 0.01)\nand greater minimum distance travelled (10 431 \u00b1 1278 vs\n855 \u00b1 281 km, W5 0, P, 0.01), without any overlap in the\ntwo groups compared in each case.\nFor gentoo penguins, juveniles first seemed to remain in\nthe waters immediately adjacent to the colonies, since no\nmovement could be inferred from the locations received\nand the transmitters never entered the \u2018haulout\u2019 mode. This\nfirst phase was therefore excluded from the analyses. In a\nsecond phase, starting between 29 January and 31 March\nFig. 2.

All transmitters generally operated\nfor hundreds of hours during this juvenile dispersion\n(Table II). Surprisingly, for four of the six birds,\ntransmissions all ended on 2 April. Juveniles from the\nopen sea locality showed a linear dispersal pattern and\nappeared to target the shelf break with depths between 200\nand 500m (Fig. 3). In the first 20 days one of these\njuveniles (coded JO-2 in Table II) reached the vicinity of\nHeard Island, situated c. 430 km to the south-east of\nKerguelen, where it remained until transmissions stopped.\nAll juveniles from the Golfe du Morbihan reached the open\nsea (after 8\u201325 days) and thereafter stayed close to the\nnorth-east and south-east coastlines, using bays and fjords\nshallower than 200m (Fig. 3). For one of them (coded JI-2\nin Table II), transmissions were lost on 2 April but started\nagain nearly six months later, in September, for several\ndays. For this bird we deleted the interpolated points during\nthis gap in order to not overweight this area in our model,\neven if locations on each side of the gap were only 54.6 km\napart.\nOn average, breeding gentoo penguins performed trips of\n2.21 days duration in the open ocean locality and 3.65 days\ninside the Golfe du Morbihan. Animals from the open\nocean locality radiated in an eastern direction from the\ncolony, mainly over the 100\u2013200m isobaths, with one bird\nreaching the 500m isobath. Adults from the Golfe du\nMorbihan showed shorter maximum ranges, and stayed\ninside the gulf, foraging between the islands neighbouring\ntheir colony. Tracking for the juvenile dispersal lasted\nmuch longer than the trips of breeding adults (Table II;\n1278 \u00b1 1890 vs 93.4 \u00b1 36.6 hours, respectively, W5 10,\nP5 0.02). This was associated with greater maximum range\n(173.0 \u00b1 167.7 vs 25.1 \u00b1 14.4 km, W5 10, P5 0.02) and\ngreater minimum distances travelled (512.8 \u00b1 302.5 vs\n81.0 \u00b1 52.0 km, W5 11, P, 0.03).\nHabitat selection of macaroni penguins\nThe MADIFA model for the interbreeding period of\nmacaroni penguins, using two principal components,\nexplained more than 96.8% of the total variance observed\nbetween the tracks and the environment (Table III, second\nPCA). The corresponding map of habitat suitability for\nmacaroni penguins during interbreeding period showed two\nmain suitable areas (Fig. 4a), matching waters mainly\n3000\u20133500m deep, while depths shallower than 1500m\nand deeper than 5000m appeared as very unfavourable.\nThe larger of the two suitable areas lies east of Kerguelen,\ncorresponding to locations used by the tracked animals.\nThe smaller one was found to the west of Kerguelen in the\nregion between 308E and 508E, and was separated from the\nother by an unfavourable area in the vicinity of the western\nFig. 3.

Very low habitat suitability levels were\nalso found over the entire Kerguelen Plateau.\nFor breeding macaroni penguins, the maximum\ntheoretical range from the colony was estimated to be\n513 km for a 15 day chick-brooding trip. In the area\ndelimited within this radius, the habitat selection model\nenabled us to build a map of habitat suitability for breeding\nmacaroni penguins (Fig. 4b). Here again, the area\nencompassing the Kerguelen Plateau showed low levels\nof suitability, with much higher levels of suitability found\nat the edges of the shelf. Tracks from the breeding animals\nsuperimposed on the modelled habitat showed that birds\nswam to the closest suitable area to their colony (Fig. 4b).\nHabitat selection of gentoo penguins from the open\nsea locality\nThe MADIFA model for juvenile gentoo penguins from\nEstacade colony was dominated by bathymetry (Table IV,\nsecond PCA: 96.0% of the variance explained on the first\nprincipal component). Suitable areas were restricted to the\nKerguelen Plateau, where depths were shallower than\n1000m (Fig. 5a). The highest suitability levels over the\nplateau corresponded to specific isobaths around 500m.\nThe maximum theoretical range from the colony\ncalculated for breeding gentoo penguins (regardless of the\ncolony location) was estimated to be 98.5 km for a three\nday trip. In the area delimited within this radius, the\nmodelled environment developed from the MADIFA\nenabled us to build a map of habitat suitability for the\nbreeding gentoo penguins (Fig. 5b). This map predicted a\nsingle strip of suitable habitat, oriented NW\u2013SE, which\npassed near to the breeding colony. On each side of this\nstrip there were areas of very low habitat suitability. Tracks\nfrom breeding adults superimposed on the modelled habitat\nshowed they mostly utilized the area highlighted, with the\nhighest ARGOS location densities over the areas of highest\nsuitability. However, two very linear tracks occurred over\nareas predicted as much less suitable.\nTable IV. Summary of the MADIFA for dispersing juvenile gentoo\npenguins from the open sea locality.

The map of\nhabitat suitability for these dispersing juvenile gentoo\npenguins (Fig. 6a) confirmed that the Kerguelen Plateau\nwas the only suitable area available to them. However, in the\ncase of the birds from the Golfe du Morbihan the areas with\nthe highest habitat suitability were found in shallower areas\n(, 200m deep), closer to the coasts of Kerguelen and Heard\nIsland than was obtained for birds from the open sea locality.\nFor the breeding gentoo penguins from the Golfe du\nMorbihan, the map of habitat suitability predicted from the\nMADIFA showed that the most favourable areas were\nfragmented and occurred across the Kerguelen Plateau,\nwith the highest levels of habitat suitability found inside the\ngulf and along the north coastline of Kerguelen (Fig. 6b).\nTracks of breeding adults corresponded closely with the\nmost favourable areas found inside the gulf.\nDiscussion\nThis study measured the effects of breeding constraints on\nthe foraging range and habitat selection of two contrasting\npenguin species, using both previously published data and\nnew datasets describing animal movements, to develop\nhabitat suitability maps. This study also provides the first\ndata on the juvenile dispersal of gentoo penguins.\nOur first prediction (i.e. that the release of constraints\nassociated with breeding will lead to a larger foraging range\nand greater distances travelled) was strongly supported by\nthe results obtained from both models. Macaroni penguins\nshowed an elevenfold increase in their at-sea time between\nchick-brooding and interbreeding trips, this was associated\nwith significantly greater maximum range (6.8 times more)\nand minimum distance travelled (12.2 times more). For\ngentoo penguins, the same pattern was also observed\nalthough the juvenile dispersal was not exhaustively\ncovered by the telemetric survey. Maximum range was at\nleast 6.9 times more than for breeding individuals, while the\ndistance travelled was at least 6.3 times more. Gentoo\npenguins are generally thought to be sedentary outside the\nbreeding period, foraging at sea during the day but returning\nto the colony or a similar terrestrial habitat during the night,\nwith similar at-sea movements in the post-breeding period to\nthose during the breeding season (Bost & Jouventin 1990,\nWilson et al. 1998, Tanton et al. 2004). However, our data,\nthe first describing the juvenile dispersal for this species,\nshows that juveniles migrate over a much larger scale than\npreviously thought and over a larger scale than breeding\nadults.\nOur second prediction (i.e. that breeding animals only\nexploit the closest suitable habitats) was also largely\nsupported by both study models. The tracks of breeding\nindividuals appeared to closely match with the nearest\nsuitable habitats predicted by the larger scale behaviour of\nnon-breeding birds. On Kerguelen, the two penguin species\nappear to segregate in space, with a spectacular contrasting\nuse of the Kerguelen Plateau. Macaroni penguins exploited\nareas beyond the shelf break in both breeding and\ninterbreeding periods, while gentoo penguins seemed to\nbe always restricted to the shelf area. This segregation in\nspace reflects the different exploitation of the environment\n(diving mode and diet) between the gentoo, a plastic,\ninshore forager, and the pelagic specialist macaroni penguin\n(Lescroe\u00a8l & Bost 2005, Deagle et al. 2008).\nThe greatest discrepancy for our model was for breeding\ngentoo penguins from the open ocean colony, which did not\nalways closely match with the predicted areas of habitat\nsuitability (Fig. 6b). However, these tracks only consisted\nof a very few ARGOS locations (Lescroe\u00a8l & Bost 2005)\nand the patterns observed were produced by the linear\nre-interpolation of the tracks. Conversely, aggregations\nof ARGOS locations matched the areas of maximum\nsuitability levels. Interestingly, these areas also matched\nthe known distribution of benthic nototheniid fish targeted\nby gentoo penguins (Lescroe\u00a8l et al. 2004). For gentoo\npenguins from the Golfe du Morbihan, suitable habitats\npredicted for breeding adults also corresponded to areas of\nhigh zooplankton production during the summer (Lescroe\u00a8l\net al. 2004).\nWhy larger scale movements for non-breeding\nindividuals?\nOutside the breeding period, it has been shown that\nmacaroni penguins remain consistently at sea (Bost et al.\n2009). In contrast gentoo penguins do return ashore during\nthe winter (see above). Our results lead us to question\nwhy in both species, animals that are free from breeding\nconstraints move over a larger scale, even when suitable\nhabitat areas seem available within a smaller radius.\nWe suggest that two important facts are crucial. Firstly,\nthe habitat suitability index given by the MADIFA is only\nrelative. Hence, the suitability of a specific area depends\nnot only on the suitability calculated for the area itself, but\nalso on the entire region considered to be available in the\nwider environment. More favourable habitats may therefore\nbe found outside the spatial range displayed for breeding\nadults (compare Fig. 4a & b). Second, our results suggest\nhabitat selection is constant, which implies that animals\nmay actually track a specific set of environmental\nconditions. Prey availability is a key among these latter,\nand probably is not constant but rather varies according to\nthe life cycle of the prey itself and to predator activity\naround the colony (Ashmole 1963, Birt et al. 1987,\nCharrassin et al. 2002, Ainley et al. 2004). According to\nthe season, the suitable environmental conditions targeted\nHABITAT SELECTION BY PENGUINS 123\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 14 Nov 2013 IP address: 194.66.0.114\nby the predator may therefore occur distantly from the\ncolony. Such factors drive the breeding phenology of a\nspecies (Durant et al. 2005), and it is therefore probable\nthat species have evolved so as to match their breeding\nseason to a time period that allows them to most easily find\npredictable prey in the vicinity of their colony. Further,\nlarger scale movements outside the breeding period\nminimize any potential intra-specific competition for food\nat a time when food availability may be lower (Clarke\n1988, Koslov et al. 1991).\nLimits of this study\nAlthough a reasonable number of individuals were equipped\nduring both the interbreeding period of macaroni penguins\nand the breeding period of gentoo penguins from the open\nsea, only a limited number of devices were available for\nbreeding macaroni and juvenile gentoo penguins. These low\nnumbers might be an issue where we wish to have an\nexhaustive or at least an unbiased sampling relevant to\ncapturing the patterns of the penguins\u2019 ecological niche (see\nCalenge et al. 2008). However, a similar directional foraging\neffort has been obtained previously using tracks of breeding\nmacaroni penguins, suggesting that a common population\nlevel strategy operates (Trathan et al. 2006). This fact that\npenguins concentrate their foraging effort in certain areas\nwas well predicted by our study, probably as a result of the\nbroad base of habitat use gathered from the interbreeding\nperiod tracks. The basis of the habitat model for gentoo\npenguins was derived from tracking juveniles. Here again,\nthe patterns obtained at the colony level revealed reasonably\ncoherent dispersal patterns associated with the topographic\nenvironment, even though the tracking duration was\nrelatively short.\nOutside the breeding period, we studied (supposedly)\nexperienced adult macaroni penguins, while for gentoo\npenguins, we based our knowledge on non-experienced,\n\u2018naive\u2019 animals. We acknowledge that juveniles may not be\nas good predictors of the behaviour of breeding animals as\nmay be non-breeding adults, as recently-fledged juveniles\nhave to learn how to efficiently exploit their environment.\nHowever, the tracking of juvenile gentoo penguins amounted\nto more than 53 days on average, a duration previously seen\nas long enough to reflect habitat choices made by penguins\nfree from breeding constraints (e.g. Rey et al. 2007). We can\nalso see this duration as long enough to assume that the\njuveniles did not die by inability to exploit their environment\nand find food, since apparently, these data allowed us to\nreasonably predict suitable habitat areas for breeding adults.\nMoreover, since four of the six tracked birds stopped\ntransmitting on the same day, and one of them started\ntransmitting again several months later from a close marine\nlocation, we believe that tracking ended because of technical\nissues of unknown origin, and not due to any mortality of\nanimals associated with their failure to find suitable habitat.\nIt is generally recognized that interannual variability\nin environmental conditions might impact the at-sea\ndistribution of animals. However, according to Trathan\net al. (2006), penguins show very consistent interannual\nat-sea distribution during the breeding season. Outside the\nbreeding period, there are also a number of studies on\nseabirds that suggest site philopatry (Phillips et al. 2005,\nRey et al. 2007), adding strength to our conclusions and\nsuggesting that, though few in number in most cases, our\nsamples are representative.\nConclusions and perspectives\nOur study confirms that the breeding period is associated\nwith a reduction in the available habitat for central place\nforaging animals such as seabirds, and importantly, suggests\nthat mechanisms and criteria for habitat selection are the\nsame during and outside the breeding periods, given the\navailable environment. Environmental variability, including\nseasonal effects of prey, potentially drives the larger scale\nmovements observed outside the breeding period. These\nconclusions are relevant for the two species studied in this\nwork, although these were two contrasting species. Further,\nthis study highlighted that the respective optimal habitats\nof these species are clearly segregated, between the pelagic\nmacaroni penguins (Fig. 4), the shelf-associated gentoo\npenguins from the open sea (Fig. 5) and the coastal gentoo\npenguins from the Golfe du Morbihan (Fig. 6). These major\ndiving predators therefore seem to utilize a large range of\nthe depths available in the marine environment surrounding\nIles Kerguelen, and such habitat partitioning along other\necological dimensions (such as diet) may elucidate how\nfour sympatric penguin species coexist on Iles Kerguelen\n(Weimerskirch et al. 1988).\nThough beyond our practical abilities, it would have\nbeen interesting to have collected information about the\nactual foraging locations of the animals tracked, in order to\nexclude the travelling\/exploring parts of their trips, and\ntherefore allowing us to draw stronger conclusions about\nthe favourable habitats experienced. The time of the year,\nas well as the size and proximity of the locations of\ncolonies of conspecifics may also have been valuable\nproxies for prey availability that could have been included\ninto the models, so that habitat suitability levels would\nbetter reflect the at-sea ecology of these predators.\nComparing the results we obtained for the non-breeding\nperiod with the tracking of non-breeding adults during the\nbreeding season would also have been a useful control to\nhelp clarify which factor (season or breeding status) was\nresponsible for the long range migration patterns observed.\nOur study highlights the pelagic specialization of\nmacaroni penguins, possibly explaining why the colonies\nof this species are exclusively situated at the extreme ends\nof the Iles Kerguelen (Weimerskirch et al. 1988). However,\nfemale macaroni penguins make daily trips to sea to feed\n124 JEAN-BAPTISTE THIEBOT et al.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 14 Nov 2013 IP address: 194.66.0.114\ntheir chicks before the chicks are thermally independent\n(Stahl et al. 1985). Given this short time available at sea,\nthey would not be able to reach pelagic areas. Therefore, it\nwould be interesting to know to what extent they modify\ntheir habitat requirements during the breeding phase when\ntime is in short supply.\nFor gentoo penguins, our results on juveniles showed\nthat naive animals from different environments (closed vs\nopen sea) target different habitats. Therefore, we assume\nthat genetic isolation between the penguins from both\nenvironments may take place in their separate breeding\ngrounds, possibly linked to their separate foraging grounds.\nFeasibly this may be driven by the different prey targeted\n(Lescroe\u00a8l et al. 2004).\nIn both species studied, the recent population declines\nmeasured worldwide may be linked to food availability\n(Lescroe\u00a8l & Bost 2006, Cresswell et al. 2008). Consequently,\nknowledge about the habitats used by these species is\nessential if we are to understand what drives population\nprocesses, particularly in an era of rapid environmental\nchange. Our study highlights that simply focusing on the\nbreeding period is almost certainly insufficient to fully\nunderstand the ecological requirements of these species and\ntheir vulnerability to changes in marine resources.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Ethics Committee of Institut Polaire Franc\u00b8ais Paul-\nE\u00b4mile Victor approved all field procedures.
