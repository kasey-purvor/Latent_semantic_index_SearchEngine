There is extensive evidence for localisation of Kv1 subunits at many central \nsynaptic terminals but few clues to their presynaptic function. We have used the \ncalyx of Held to investigate the role of presynaptic Kv1 channels in the rat by \nselectively blocking Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 containing channels with dendrotoxin-K \n(DTX-K) and tityustoxin-K\u03b1 (TsTX-K\u03b1) respectively. We show that Kv1.2 \nhomomers are responsible for two-thirds of presynaptic low threshold current, \nwhilst Kv1.1\/1.2 heteromers contribute the remaining current. These channels are \nlocated in the transition zone between the axon and synaptic terminal, contrasting \nwith the high threshold K+ channels Kv3.1, which are located on the synaptic \nterminal itself. Kv1 homomers were absent from bushy cell somata (from which the \ncalyx axons arise); instead somatic low threshold channels consisted of heteromers \ncontaining Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.6 subunits. Current-clamp recording from the \ncalyx showed that each presynaptic action potential (AP) was followed by a \ndepolarising after-potential (DAP) lasting around 100ms. Kv1.1\/1.2 heteromers had \nlittle influence on terminal excitability, since DTX-K did not alter AP firing. \nHowever TsTX-K\u03b1 increased DAP amplitude, bringing the terminal closer to \nthreshold for generating an additional AP. Paired pre- and postsynaptic recording \nconfirmed that this aberrant AP evoked an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). \nWe conclude that Kv1.2 channels have a general presynaptic function in \nsuppressing terminal hyperexcitability during the depolarising after-potential. \n 2\nVoltage-gated K+ conductances play multiple roles in regulating neuronal excitability. \nHigh threshold channels (such as Kv3) shape the action potential waveform and facilitate \nrapid repolarisation (Rudy & McBain, 2001). Low threshold K+ channels which activate \nclose to resting potentials (such as Kv1) regulate firing threshold and excitability (Brew \n& Forsythe, 1995) and their mutation or deletion may result in epilepsy and ataxia (Smart \net al., 1998). Six of the seven Shaker-related Kv1 family members (Kv1.1-1.6) are \nexpressed throughout the mammalian brain and there is extensive evidence for Kv1 \nlocalisation adjacent to nodes of Ranvier and at many central synaptic terminals (Wang et \nal., 1994).  \n \nOwing to the difficulties in directly recording from nerve terminals, the function of \npresynaptic Kv1 channels remains elusive. Blockade of channels containing Kv1.1, \nKv1.2 or Kv1.6 subunits by dendrotoxin-I caused spontaneous firing at the \nneuromuscular junction (Anderson & Harvey, 1988). Similar observations have been \nmade at central synapses such as inhibitory cerebellar basket cell terminals where \nblockade of channels containing Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits increased the rate and \namplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) (Southan & \nRobertson, 1998; Zhang et al., 1999; Southan & Robertson, 2000).  However the \nsensitivity of these sIPSCs to tetrodotoxin and the absence of a rise in presynaptic [Ca2+]i \n(Tan & Llano, 1999), suggest that the firing rate in basket cell terminals was increased \nrather than APs broadened. Similarly, in MNTB neurones DTX-I has no effect on the \namplitude of evoked EPSCs (Brew & Forsythe, 1995) suggesting that the low threshold \ncurrents at the calyx of Held do not contribute to AP broadening.  \n 3\n We have used the calyx of Held to examine the role of Kv1 channels at central excitatory \nsynapses by making direct pre- and postsynaptic recordings, combined with subunit \nspecific pharmacology and immunohistochemistry. We show that Kv1 channels do not \ninfluence terminal AP waveform but instead suppress axonal excitability ensuring that \naberrant APs are not generated.  \n \nMethods \nElectrophysiology \nCochlear nucleus and brainstem slices (100-150\u00b5m thick) were prepared as previously \ndescribed (Rusznak et al., 1997; Dodson et al., 2002). 8-14 day old Wistar and Lister \nHooded rats were killed by decapitation in accordance with UK Home Office regulations. \nWhole-cell patch recordings were made from visually identified presynaptic terminals \nusing an Optopatch amplifier (Cairn, Faversham, UK). Bushy cells were identified by \nlocation and morphology when filled with Lucifer yellow. During recording, slices were \nperfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, ~1 ml min-1, 25oC). Patch pipettes \nwere pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass (GC150F-7.5, Harvard Apparatus, UK). \nPresynaptic series resistances were 19.1\u00b12.2M\u2126 (n=11) and compensated by 70% with \n10\u00b5s lag; recordings with a change exceeding \u00b12M\u2126 were excluded from analysis. Input \nresistances were 529\u00b1100M\u2126 (n=11) and did not correlate with axon length. Trapezoid \naxons were stimulated (4-10V, 0.2ms, DS2A isolated stimulator, Digitimer, Welwyn \nGarden City, UK) at the midline using a bipolar platinum electrode. For simultaneous \npre- and postsynaptic recordings, synaptic connections were detected using postsynaptic \n 4\ncalcium imaging (Billups et al., 2002). Postsynaptic EPSCs were recorded using an \nAxopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), series resistances were \n<10M\u2126 and 5mM QX-314 was included in the intracellular patch solution. IPSCs were \nblocked by 10\u00b5M bicuculline and 1\u00b5M strychnine. Data were acquired with a CED1401 \ninterface using Patch v6.39 software (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, \nUK), filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 to 40 kHz. The current amplitude for current-\nvoltage (I\/V) relationships was measured 10ms into the test step for the presynaptic \nrecordings but delayed until 180ms for bushy cells, to avoid contamination by the \ntransient outward K+ current (IA). Leak currents, estimated from a linear fit between \n-90mV to -75 mV, were subtracted from the I\/V curve. Example I\/V curves from single \ncells are presented but similar results were observed in at least 4 cells, averaged data for \nwhich are presented in the text as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. Stated voltages exclude a -7 mV \njunction potential. \n \nImmunohistochemistry   \nSections were prepared from P9 Lister Hooded rats as described previously (Dodson et \nal., 2002). Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4oC at a dilution of 1:100 and \nincubated with a FITC secondary antibody (1:1000) at 20oC or for co-localisation FITC \nand Texas Red (both 1:500) applied together. Slides were prepared using ProLong \nAntifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and examined on an Olympus Fluoview \nconfocal microscope (IX70) with a 60X (NA 1.4) objective. \n \nSolutions and Toxins \n 5\naCSF contained (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 10 glucose, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 2 \nsodium pyruvate, 3 myo-inositol, 0.5 ascorbic acid, 2 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2, gassed with \n95% O2 5% CO2 (pH 7.4). Except for synaptic studies, 0.5 mM [Ca2+]o and 2.5 mM \n[Mg2+]o were used to minimize Ca2+ dependent currents, ZD7288 (10\u00b5M, Tocris \nCookson, Bristol, UK) to block IH and tetrodotoxin (1\u00b5M TTX, Latoxan, Valence, \nFrance) to block INa. Intracellular patch solution contained (in mM): 97.5 K-gluconate, \n32.5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2 (pH 7.2 with KOH) and Lucifer yellow or \nsulforhodamine 101 (1mg\/ml Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Chemicals were obtained \nfrom Sigma (Poole, UK) except: DTX-I, Kv1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and Kv3.1b antibodies, \nAlomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel); Texas Red and FITC (Goat anti-rabbit), Jackson \nImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); Kv1.1, 1.2 and 1.6 antibodies from \nUpstate Biotechnology (NY) were used for co-localisation; TsTX-K\u03b1, Peptide Institute \n(Osaka, Japan) and DTX-K was a kind gift from Brian Robertson, University of \nStrathclyde, Glasgow. \n \nResults \nPresynaptic low threshold current is dominated by Kv1.2 homomers \nPresynaptic outward K+ currents were found to consist of both high and low threshold \ncomponents (Fig. 1A1). TsTX-K\u03b1 (100nM), which blocks channels containing Kv1.2 \nsubunits (Hopkins, 1998), blocked 87\u00b14.8% of the current evoked at -45mV (Fig. 1C3 \nn=7). The remaining current (13%) was high threshold K+ current which activates at \naround -45mV, is blocked by tetraethylammonium (TEA) and is DTX-I insensitive \n(Dodson and Forsythe, unpublished observations). DTX-K (100nM), which blocks \n 6\nchannels containing Kv1.1 subunits (Robertson et al., 1996) blocked 32\u00b14.1% of the \ncurrent (Fig. 1C3 n=6). Since only one toxin-sensitive subunit is required for these toxins \nto block and Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 are the only Kv1 subunits present in presynaptic axons in \nthe MNTB (Dodson et al., 2002), these data suggest that two-thirds of presynaptic low \nthreshold current is mediated by Kv1.2 homomers and the remaining third by \nKv1.1\/Kv1.2 heteromers. \n \nKv1.1 and Kv1.2 are concentrated in the axonal region just preceding the \nterminal \nThe distribution of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 containing channels at the calyx was investigated by \nco-localisation with Kv3.1b, which is expressed in the calyceal fingers and proximal \nregion of the axon (Fig. 2A1). Kv3.1 is also expressed at the postsynaptic MNTB soma \n(Elezgarai et al., 2003) but clearly distinguishable from presynaptic immunofluorescence \n(Fig. 2A1). Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 are concentrated in a 20\u00b5m region of the presynaptic axon \nadjacent to the terminal, but not in the calyx itself (Fig. 2A3 & B). Kv1.6 was not \nexpressed in the presynaptic axon or terminal (data not shown). \n \nHeteromeric channels containing Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.6 are expressed at \nthe Bushy cell soma. \nTo examine whether K+ currents expressed at the terminal were similar to somatic \ncurrents, we compared the calyx data with somatic recordings from bushy cells, which \ngive rise to the calyx of Held. Immunostaining for Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.6 but not Kv1.4 \n 7\nwas detected in aVCN neurones (Fig. 3A). In whole-cell recordings from bushy neurones, \nDTX-K (100nM) blocked 83.7\u00b113% of the somatic current at -45mV (Fig. 3B, n=4). \nTsTX-K\u03b1 (100nM) blocked 69.3\u00b115.2% of the low threshold current in 4 neurones, (Fig. \n3C); whereas in the remaining 3 neurones TsTX-K\u03b1 had no effect (<5% block). This \ndisparity in TsTX-K\u03b1 sensitivity is consistent with two bushy cell populations (spherical \nand globular cells) expressing different complements of Kv1 channels. Taken together, \nthese data suggest that low threshold somatic currents are mediated by heteromers \nincluding Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.6 subunits. In contrast to the calyx (Fig. 1), bushy cell \nsomata possess a transient outward current (IA), which is insensitive to TsTX-K\u03b1 and \nDTX-K (Fig. 3B2 & C2), activates at around -45mV, rapidly inactivates and is TEA-\ninsensitive (Rusznak and Szucs unpublished observations). IA currents are either \nmediated by Kv4 channels, Kv3.4, Kv1.4 or other Kv1 channels with inactivating Kv\u03b2 \nsubunits (Coetzee et al., 1999). As this IA is a high threshold TEA-insensitive current, we \ncan exclude Kv3 and Kv1 channels. Since Kv4.2 is the only Kv4 subunit expressed in \nbushy cells (Fitzakerley et al., 2000), we conclude that the bushy cell IA is most likely \ncomprised of Kv4.2 homomers. \n \nKv1.2 containing channels regulate presynaptic AP firing \nTo investigate the role of Kv1 channels at the calyx we applied subunit specific toxins \nwhilst recording from terminals under current-clamp. In brain slices calyces with less \nthan 20\u00b5m of intact axon fire a single AP in response to sustained depolarisation (Fig. \n4A1 n=10). Axon length was assessed under epifluorescent illumination by inclusion of \nsulphorhodamine in the intracellular solution. DTX-K (100nM) had no effect on AP \n 8\nfiring (Fig. 4A1 inset, n=3), suggesting that Kv1.1\/1.2 heteromers make little or no \ncontribution to terminal excitability. In contrast 100nM TsTX-K\u03b1 caused AP firing \nthroughout the current injection (Fig. 4A2, n=4) suggesting that Kv1.2 homomers \nregulate AP firing at the terminal. Calyces with more than 20\u00b5m of intact axon will \ntypically fire multiple APs during sustained current injection (Forsythe, 1994), however \nsuch long depolarisations are not physiological in axons. To produce a more \nphysiological stimulus we triggered orthodromic APs at the midline. Simultaneous dual \nrecordings were made of presynaptic APs under current-clamp along with the resulting \nMNTB neurone EPSCs under voltage-clamp. In control conditions each electrical \nstimulus evoked a single presynaptic AP which generated one EPSC in the postsynaptic \nneurone (Fig. 4B1). From a membrane potential of -75mV, evoked APs peaked at \n23\u00b16.8mV, had a half-width of 414\u00b130\u00b5s and repolarised to -71.2\u00b12mV (n=10). APs \nwere followed by a depolarising after-potential (DAP), which peaked at -62.5\u00b11.6mV, \nhad a half-width of 15.1\u00b12.4ms and is attributable to passive discharge from the myelin \nsheath (Barrett & Barrett, 1982). Single presynaptic APs were maintained when the \nterminal membrane potential was changed over a range of -90 to -25mV (data not \nshown). Following TsTX-K\u03b1 however, two APs were fired after a single stimulus (Fig. \n4B2, 100nM, 10 of 10 terminals), resulting in two EPSCs in the postsynaptic neurone. \nSimilarly aberrant firing was observed during trains of stimuli in the presence of TsTX-\nK\u03b1 (Fig. 4C2).  Multiple firing in response to orthodromic AP propagation has never \nbeen observed under control conditions, but following TsTX-K\u03b1 multiple APs were \nobserved from at all potentials of -90 to -25mV. TsTX-K\u03b1 had no effect on EPSC \namplitude in the postsynaptic neurone (P=0.93, 2 tailed paired t-test, n=5), confirming \n 9\nthat low threshold K+ currents do not influence AP waveform or release probability \n(Brew & Forsythe, 1995). The AP half-width in the presence of TsTX-K\u03b1 was unchanged \nfrom control (P=0.59 2 tailed, paired t-test); but the DAP was significantly larger \n(P=0.005) peaking at -55.4\u00b11.5mV (n=7). This suggests that the presynaptic low \nthreshold K+ conductance serves to shunt and reduce the DAP; hence when Kv1 currents \nare blocked, threshold is exceeded and a second AP is generated during the DAP. These \ndata suggest that presynaptic Kv1.2 channels prevent terminal hyperexcitability following \nAP invasion and thus preserve the timing and pattern of AP firing.   \n \n \nDiscussion \nKv1 channels are present in axons and presynaptic terminals throughout the brain (Wang \net al., 1994; Rhodes et al., 1997; Southan & Robertson, 2000). We show that presynaptic \nKv1 channels make little contribution to action potential repolarisation at the calyx of \nHeld, but promote transmission fidelity by preventing aberrant firing following an action \npotential. All presynaptic Kv1 channels contain Kv1.2 subunits; Kv1.2 homomers \ncontribute two-thirds of the current and Kv1.1\/1.2 heteromers the remaining third. This \ncontrasts with somatic Kv1 currents that are exclusively mediated by heteromeric \nchannels, composed of Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.6 subunits. Our results suggest that \npresynaptic Kv1 channels play a pivotal role in preventing nerve terminal \nhyperexcitability. \n  \n 10\nThe presynaptic low threshold current is dominated by Kv1.2 homomers; these channels \nare largely responsible for ensuring that each AP propagating from the bushy cell results \nin a single AP arriving at the terminal. Kv1.1\/1.2 heteromers are also present \npresynaptically, but blocking these channels does not influence AP firing (Fig. 4A1). This \ncontrasts with the postsynaptic MNTB neurones, which have no homomeric channels but \nwhere Kv1.1\/1.2 heteromers, located at the initial segment of the axon, are dominant in \nregulating AP firing (Dodson et al., 2002). Immunohistochemical localisation shows \nbushy cell bodies express Kv1.1\/1.2\/1.6 subunits similar to MNTB somata (Dodson et \nal., 2002; Brew et al., 2003). Subunit composition can influence localisation of channels \nby association of certain subunits with Kv\u03b2 or Caspr (Poliak et al., 1999; Manganas et \nal., 2001). A general hypothesis consistent with our observations is that Kv1.6 containing \nchannels are restricted to somatic regions whereas channels containing Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 \nare permitted access to axonal regions and contribute to initial segment, juxtaparanodal \nand terminal low threshold K+ conductances. Heteromers contribute at all sites, with \nKv1.2 homomers located exclusively at the transition zone between the axon and \nterminal. This observation may have therapeutic implications for selective regulation of \npresynaptic versus postsynaptic excitability. \n \nImmunohistochemical studies demonstrate that most Kv1 channels isolated from brain \nsynaptic membranes contain Kv1.2 subunits with Kv1.2 homomers being prevalent \n(Shamotienko et al., 1997). Our results show that Kv1.2 channels are located at the \ntransition zone between the axon and terminal (the last 20\u00b5m) but are excluded from the \nterminal itself (Fig. 2). Kv1 channels are also localised at transition zones at the \n 11\nneuromuscular junction (Zhou et al., 1998) thus allowing greatest influence over AP \ninvasion of the terminal and minimizing antidromic reflection by raising threshold \nfollowing an AP. Kv1 channels also exert control over axonal APs in the initial segment \n(observed in recordings from MNTB neurones, Dodson et al., 2002). \n \nIn some nerve terminals such as hippocampal mossy fibre boutons (Geiger & Jonas, \n2000) and neurohypophysis terminals of the pituitary (Jackson et al., 1991) inactivating \nK+ currents are responsible for activity-dependent AP broadening and facilitation of \ntransmitter release. For example in hippocampal mossy fibre boutons, low threshold \nDTX-sensitive channels, presumed to contain Kv1.1, Kv1.4 and Kv\u03b21 subunits, \ninactivate during repetitive stimulation causing AP broadening (Rhodes et al., 1997; \nGeiger & Jonas, 2000).  \n \nIn other terminals however Kv1 channels are involved in preventing hyperexcitability. In \nthe frontal cortex, blockade of putative Kv1.2 homomers causes local spiking in \nthalamocortical axon terminals (Lambe & Aghajanian, 2001) and in the entorhinal cortex, \n\u03b1-DTX block of Kv1.2 containing channels increases the frequency of sIPSCs \n(Cunningham & Jones, 2001). Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 are highly concentrated in cerebellar \nbasket cell terminals (Wang et al., 1994; Rhodes et al., 1997) and block of the \npresynaptic Kv1 current by \u03b1-DTX increases both frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs in \nPurkinje cells (Southan & Robertson, 1998, 2000). Kv1.1 null mice also exhibit increased \nspontaneous activity at cerebellar basket cell synapses (Zhang et al., 1999), \nhyperexcitability of peripheral axons (Zhou et al., 1998) and epilepsy (Smart et al., \n 12\n1998). We have demonstrated that Kv1.2 channels prevent hyperexcitability at the calyx \nof Held, preserving AP fidelity which is critical for sound source localisation (Trussell, \n1999). Our results also highlight the general importance of Kv1 channels in preventing \nerrors during repetitive firing. The widespread distribution of presynaptic Kv1 channels, \ncombined with their importance in preventing aberrant firing suggests a general role for \npresynaptic Kv1 channels in preventing hyperexcitability in nerve terminals throughout \nthe central and peripheral nervous system. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank Dr L.

A3, Co-localisation of Kv3.1b (red) and \nKv1.2 (green), confirming that Kv1.2 is localised to presynaptic (\u2020) as well as \npostsynaptic (*) axons. B, Co-localisation of Kv3.1b and Kv1.1 shows that Kv1.1 is \nlocated in an axonal region similar to Kv1.2 (arrow). Images in A and B are single \nconfocal optical sections n=3 animals. Scale bar in A1 is 20\u00b5m and applies to all parts. \n \nFigure 3.  Heteromers containing Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.6 subunits comprise bushy \ncell low threshold somatic currents.  \nA, Neurones of the aVCN express Kv1.1 (A1), Kv1.2 (A2) and Kv1.6 (A5) at their soma. \nKv1.4 is not expressed (A4) since immunofluorescence is similar to the background level \n(A3). Immunofluorescence was visualised using a X10 objective on an epifluorescent \nmicroscope (n=3 animals). Scale bar represents 200\u00b5m. B1, Voltage-clamp recordings \nfrom bushy cells. Voltage protocols were as in Fig. 1 without leak subtraction. B2, DTX-\nK (100nM) blocked 83.7\u00b113% of the low threshold current, leaving the high threshold \n 14\ncurrent and a rapidly inactivating transient current, both of which activate around -45mV. \nB3, I\/V for the data in B1 (filled circles) and B2 (open circles). C1, Control currents \nrecorded in a different bushy cell. C2, TsTX-K\u03b1 (100nM) blocked 69.3\u00b115.2% of the low \nthreshold current in 4 neurones. In the remaining 3 neurones TsTX-K\u03b1 had no effect \n(<5% block). C3, I\/V for the currents in C1 (filled circles) and C2 (open circles). \n \nFigure 4.  Kv1.2 containing channels prevent aberrant presynaptic action potential \nfiring.  \nA1, Control response to 150pA current injection recorded from a presynaptic terminal \nunder current-clamp. DTX-K (100nM) had no effect on AP firing (inset; n=3). A2, TsTX-\nK\u03b1 (100nM) caused firing throughout the current injection (n=3). Scale bars in A \nrepresent 50mV and 50ms. B1, Simultaneous recording of the presynaptic AP (under \ncurrent-clamp) and the postsynaptic EPSC (under voltage-clamp). APs were evoked by \nelectrical stimulation at the midline (arrows). In control conditions, a single AP and \ncorresponding EPSC are generated by each stimulus (n=13; upper portion of the \npostsynaptic stimulus artefact was removed). B2, Following Kv1.2 block with 100nM \nTsTX-K\u03b1, an aberrant AP is fired in the terminal during the DAP which triggered a \nsecond EPSC in the MNTB neurone (n=10). C1, 20 Hz train under control conditions. \nB3, In TsTX-K\u03b1 aberrant APs are fired during the DAPs at 20 Hz stimulation (n=3). \n \nReferences \n \nAnderson AJ & Harvey AL. (1988).
