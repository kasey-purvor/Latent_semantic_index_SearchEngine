Marra**\n* Pennsylvania State University and **AT&T, USA\nIntroduction\nWe seek to provide an alternative theoretical perspective on concept mapping (a formalism\nfor representing structural knowledge) to that provided by Ray McAleese in this issue of ALT-J\n(auto-monitoring). We begin with an overview of concept maps as a means of describing a\nlearner's knowledge constructs, and then discuss a broader class of tools, Mindtools, of which\nconcept maps are a member. We proceed by defining Mindtools as formalisms for represent-\ning knowledge, and further elaborate on concept maps as a formalism for representing a\nparticular kind of knowledge: structural knowledge. We then address McAleese's use of the\nterm auto-monitoring and some of the steps in his model of concept maps. Finally, we\ndescribe some limitations of concept mapping as a formalism and as a cognitive learning\nstrategy.\nConcept maps, both in how they are used and theoretically based, touch some of the central\nelements of instructional technology and learning. Concept maps address the critical issue of\nhow we organize our knowledge structures within and between domains. They, in some sense,\nmodel how we represent and apply knowledge. Assuming that instructional technology, as a\nfield, has a goal of being able systematically to make instruction more effective, then tools\n50\nAu-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nsuch as concept maps that allow us to see and understand what the learner is starting with\nseem critical. Concept maps may fall into a larger category of tools, Mindtools, that enhance\nour understanding of how learners organize and use knowledge.\nMindtools\nMindtools are computer-based tools and learning environments that have been adapted or\ndeveloped to support critical thinking in the form of knowledge representation (Jonassen, in\npress). These tools include (but are not necessarily limited to) databases, microworlds and\nlearning environments, spreadsheets, semantic networks and concept maps, expert systems,\nmultimedia construction, computer-mediated communication, and programming languages.\nMindtools, otherwise known as cognitive tools (Kommers et al 1992), or 'content-free\ncourseware' as McAleese refers to them, are generalizable computer tools that are intended to\nengage and facilitate cognitive and meta-cognitive processing - hence cognitive tools. Derry\n(1990) has defined cognitive tools as both mental and computational devices that support,\nguide, and extend the thinking processes of their users. They are knowledge-construction and\nfacilitation tools that can be applied to a variety of subject-matter domains. We believe that\nstudents cannot use these tools without thinking deeply about the content that they are\nlearning.\nCognitive tools are an example of learning with information processing technologies as\nopposed to learning from them (Salomon et al 1991). Learning with technologies amplifies\nthe learner's cognitive processes while using those technologies. Computer-based cognitive\ntools and environments are, in effect, cognitive amplification tools. Environments that employ\ncognitive tools distribute cognition to the person plus their 'surround' - the physical and social\nresources available to them (Perkins 1993). This is perhaps the most powerful rationale for\nMindtools. If we consider the learner and the computer as parts of a total learning system, our\ngoal should be to distribute the cognitive responsibility appropriately to the different parts of\nthe system. Rather than requiring learners to store and retrieve information, which is some-\nthing that computers do much better, relegate those responsibilities to the computer and\nrequire the learners to identify patterns, develop organizational schemes, and synthesize\ninformation, which are things that humans do much better than computers. Mindtools more\nappropriately distribute the cognitive responsibilities to the appropriate parts of the learning\nsystem.\nMindtools are not intended necessarily to reduce information processing, that is, make\nlearning easier, as has been the goal of instructional design and most instructional technolo-\ngies, but rather to engage learners in more effective processes of learning. Nor are they\n'fingertip' tools (Perkins 1993) that learners use naturally, effortlessly, and effectively. Rather,\nMindtools provide an environment and vehicle that often require learners to think harder\nabout the subject-matter domain being studied while generating thoughts that would be\nimpossible without the tool. They are cognitive reflection and amplification tools that help\nlearners to construct their own realities using the constructs and processes in the environment\non a new content domain. McAleese's description of a learner engaged in a 'cognitively\nactive process in an environment that supports the manipulation of knowledge artefacts' could\nin fact be described as a learner who is engaged with some sort of a Mindtool - in this case,\none that supports concept mapping. The tool allows the learner to represent and explicitly\nmanipulate knowledge formalisms and thus 'amplifies' or makes concrete what would\notherwise be abstract and difficult to grasp.\n51\nDavid Jonassen and Rose Marra Mindtools for representing knowledge\nMindtools as representational formalisms\nMindtools consist of different formalisms for representing knowledge; that is, they use\ndifferent schemes that can be used to represent content or personal knowledge. Expository\ntext is the most common formalism that we use to capture and represent what we know or\nhave learned. However, expository prose constrains the learner's representation. Writing is a\ncomplex activity whose syntax and multiple text-structures entail a great deal of cognitive\noverhead.\nMindtools provide different, more constrained formalisms for representing personal knowl-\nedge. Mindtools, like text, require that learners represent domain knowledge in a knowledge\nbase with formal, constrained statements of relationships between the ideas in the knowledge\nbase. However, the relationships and fundamental structures that are generated by each\nformalism vary. There are many classes of Mindtools. Each class engages different critical\nthinking skills (Jonassen, in press) and involves different syntax and representational\nformalisms. Since this issue focuses on concept mapping, we shall next treat it in greater\ndepth.\nMapping structural knowledge via concept maps\nConcept mapping is a formalism for representing structural knowledge (Jonassen et al 1993).\nStructural knowledge is the knowledge of how concepts within a domain are interrelated\n(Diekhoff 1983). If schemas are defined by their interrelationships to other schemas, then\nexplicit awareness of those interrelationships and the ability to explicate those relationships\nare essential for higher-order procedural knowledge. Declarative knowledge is not a sufficient\nprerequisite for procedural knowledge. In order to acquire procedural knowledge, it is neces-\nsary to understand the propositional relationships between the entities involved in both the\nprocedural and declarative knowledge structures.\nStructural knowledge provides that link between procedural and declarative knowledge.\nStructural knowledge, the understanding of these relationships, enables learners to form the\nconnections they need in order to use scripts or complex schemas: that is, the ability actually\nto apply what they know. Structural knowledge has been conceived and described by several\ndifferent authors (Preece 1976; Tennyson and Cocciarella 1986), but the underlying assump-\ntion of all descriptions of structural knowledge is that meaning for any concept or construct is\nimplicit in the pattern of relationships to other concept or constructs.\nConcept mapping, whether accomplished with paper and pencil or using sophisticated seman-\ntic networking tools such as SemNet, Learning Tool, TextVision, or CMap, are means for\nrepresenting cognitive structures (Jonassen 1987), ideas and dieir complex interrelationships\n(schemata) in memory that provide meaning to the language used to transmit those ideas.\nSchema theory and semantic networking theory are the theoretical bases for concept mapping.\nThese theories are based on schemas, which are arranged in networks (schemata) of inter-\nrelated concepts. These networks are known as semantic networks. Perhaps the best-known\nconceptualization of a semantic network is active structural networks (Quillian 1968), struc-\ntures that are composed of nodes (the equivalent of schemas) and ordered, typed relationships\nor links connecting them. The nodes are token instances of concepts or propositions, and the\nlinks described the propositional relationship between them. As such, concept maps and\nsemantic networks describe a person's knowledge of the interrelationships between ideas\n52\nAcr-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\n(Jonassen et al 1993). In addition to the tools mentioned above (SemNet, etc.) that allow\nlearners to create their own concept maps, there are other tools designed to create concept\nmaps from similarity ratings between concept pairs in a particular domain.\nThese raw similarity ratings from the learners are algorithmically transformed (via an algo-\nrithm such as Pathfinder Net - Schvaneveldt et al 1985) into a concept-map form of knowl-\nedge representation. This representation can be evaluated via some criteria, such as whether it\ncan accurately classify members of dissimilar classes (for example, expert and novice).\nPathfinder nets is another concept-mapping tool used to represent structural knowledge.\nResponse to McAleese: auto-monitoring and internal negotiations\nSo far, our commentary has centred on our view of concept'maps and how they fit with the\nconcept of Mindtools and structural knowledge. This section discusses a couple of points from\nMcAleese's concept-mapping rationale. We shall start by looking at the idea of auto-monitor-\ning and how it relates to some previously addressed ideas, and then address McAleese's stages\nof concept modelling from a more constructivistic perspective.\nStructural knowledge, meta-cognition and auto-monitoring\nPerhaps the difference between these terms is just a matter of semantics, but even if that is the\ncase, it is worth discussing, since meaning (semantics) is the essence of the'topic we are\ndiscussing. We consider McAleese's use of the term auto-monitoring. We propose that there is\nvery little difference between McAleese's term and other ideas - namely, what we have\npreviously described as structural knowledge and what is universally known as meta-cogni-\ntion. The rationale for our concern is a growing need for parsimony in our communications.\nMcAleese defines auto-monitoring as a technique 'of personal or group knowledge presenta-\ntion and re-presentation', and further indicates that these techniques are often supported by\nvarious computer applications that graphically represent knowledge structures. He further\nacknowledges that the 'main problem' with auto-monitoring is its universality; that is,\nMcAleese himself admits the influence of the concepts of meta-cognition and reflective\npractice on auto-monitoring. We agree with these influences, and would prefer to say that the\ndistinction between these concepts and auto-monitoring is perhaps only in the application of\nthe term auto-monitoring tq the meta-cognitive process that occurs as a learner self-negotiates\nwhile creating a concept map.\nMcAleese argues that auto-monitoring is distinct from meta-cognition because auto-monitor-\ning not only is aware of the cognitive processes, but also is in charge of creating them. We\nreply that without the awareness of the creation process and the knowledge structures (declar-\native and procedural) on which the creation is based, the creation itself would be impossible.\nIn other words, the meta-cognitive controls that allow learners to look inward and understand\ntheir own knowledge structures is a necessary step for the subsequent instantiation of these\nstructures into a cognitive map. This is supported by the common distinction in the meta-\ncognition literature between executive control processes and comprehension monitoring.\nFurther, we would argue that what learners must actually be aware of is not only their declara-\ntive and procedural knowledge structures, but the structural knowledge structures that link\nand provide the meaning necessary to apply the previous two.\n53\nDavid Jonassen and Rose Marra Mindtools for representing knowledge\nCommitment, checking and confirming: a constructivistic perspective\nMcAleese describes a series of stages in which learners engage when creating a concept map.\nOnce concepts and nodes have been created, the learner engages in a process of linking nodes\nand describing the relationship between nodes, and then a re-scrutinization of those nodes and\nlinks (checking) to make sure they agree with their representations and resolving any conflicts\ndiscovered in labelling links (resolution). From a constructivist perspective, this process of\nlearners attempting to resolve their own conflicts about how to represent and label knowledge\nis referred to as internal negotiation (Jonassen et al, in press). Just as meaning is derived and\nsocially negotiated between individuals from a constructivist perspective, so individuals must\ndo the same with themselves. We engage in this internal negotiation activity almost con-\nstantly, and often without explicitly realizing it as we process new stimuli and link them to\nexisting concepts and knowledge structures. Perhaps the greatest strength of concept-mapping\ntools is that they make learners deal explicitly and consciously with what is normally an\nimplicit activity. And further, explicitly instantiating this normally implicit\/internal process\nmay be why it is difficult for some learners to commit to a particular concept map. (Tools\nsuch as Pathfinder nets that create a concept map from similarity ratings avoid some of the\ndifficulty of the learner having to sort out all of the relationships for themselves).\nMcAleese describes the confirming stage as where the learner 'agrees' that the representation\nis what was intended and further elaborates on the significance of the 'commitment' process.\nWe wish to agree with McAleese's position that total commitment to a learner's representa-\ntion may not occur due to cognitive dissonance and the tension between describing a concept\nrelationship in one of several similar fashions. Further, we emphasize that it seems very likely\nthat a map a learner creates in one sitting (and thought they were 'finished' with), may look\nvery incomplete or even incorrect when revisited. This seems perfectly reasonable, given the\nfluid nature of an individual's knowledge structures. In different contexts or at different times,\nan individual's representation will be very different.\nOnce again, from a constructivistic perspective, existing knowledge structures are continually\nbeing modified as we sense and process and meld new ideas to existing schemas and sche-\nmata. If this is the case, then a learner's conception of relationships between various concepts\nwill undoubtedly change, thus making total commitment to a concept map over a long period\nof time seem rather unlikely. Like McAleese we would agree this is a good thing in that if\nlearners (and instructors) are aware that their views of the world may legitimately change and\ngrow, then more may be gained by revisiting previous concept maps.\nLimitations of concept maps and semantic networks\nIt is easy to become enamoured of representational tools like concept mapping and semantic\nnetworking. They are powerful tools, but they are easily attributed too much power. We now\ndiscuss a few cautionary notes.\nReification of representations\nSemantic network theory is an example of a symbolic processing model of cognition. This\ntraditional view of learning assumes that human memory consists of stored facts and proce-\ndures. Clancy (1992) challenges the 'identity hypothesis' of these symbolic representation\nmodels, claiming that semantic-network theorists see nets as isomorphic representations of\nwhat is stored in memory. That is, memory structures (and by inference, structural knowledge)\n54\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nliterally exist as representations in the mind - that they represent not only behaviour but also\ninternal representational structures and mental processes. Concept maps and semantic net-\nworks can be too readily thought to reify the structures of the mind. This implies that the\nsemantic store of information in humans can be cognitively mapped and literally searched just\nas a computer searches its memory stores. These assumptions impute far too much reality to\nconcept maps. They are not truly maps of the mind, but rather representations of what we\nthink is in the mind. In truth, they are not even really good at that for the following reasons.\nEphemerality, dynamics, and context dependence of semantic networks\nConnectionist models, the alternatives to symbolic representation models, believe that\nmemory is distributed in different memory locations. They see structural knowledge as neural\nnetworks that encode memories in multiple locations - that memory is not static as symbolic\nrepresentations assume. Memory changes according to the context in which the events\noccurred or the context in which ideas are being recalled. Structural knowledge is dynamic.\nWhat is recalled depends on the context, the need, and a number of other variables.\nStructural knowledge is therefore ephemeral. It is not the same over time. Yet many people\ntake concepts maps as literal, static, and immutable representations of what is known. Con-\ncept mapping tools would need to enable minute-by-minute, context-by-context changes in\nthe concepts, relationships and structures that are represented in it in order more accurately to\nrepresent knowledge.\nComplexity of internal semantic networks and simplicity of their representations\nThe prepositional networks in the mind, in whatever form they really exist, are far more\ncomplex than anything that can be represented in a concept map. Conceptually, all the\nconstructs that we know are interrelated and multiply, encoded in rich, very redundant\nnetworks of ideas. Concepts are not just linked to one another in one way. Two concepts may\nbe linked in multiple ways. These networks are multidimensional, yet n-dimensionality is a\nconcept that is extremely difficult to grasp and even harder to represent in two or three-\ndimensional space. At best, concept maps are distillations of what we know.\nConclusion\nIn this short contribution, we have argued that:\n\u2022 the main strength of concept maps is making explicit what is normally implicit;\n\u2022 we agree with much of what McAleese proposes but do not see auto-monitoring as\ndifferent from rheta-cognition and structural knowledge;\n\u2022 from a constructivist perspective, the concept map creation process supports the\nrole of internal knowledge negotiation; ' \u2022\n\u2022 concept maps should be interpreted cautiously and used only as an ephemeral\nknowledge-representation tool for internally and socially negotiating the knowledge\nconstruction process.\n55\nDavid Jonassen and Rose Marra Mindtools for representing knowledge\nReferences\nClancy, W.J.
