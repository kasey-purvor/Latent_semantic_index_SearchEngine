In the last 15 years there has been a growth of interest in using 2D arrays of \nvery small pyroelectric elements for uncooled thermal imaging [2,3].  A range of pyroelectric \nmaterials have been used for these devices and some of the most sensitive are ceramics such \nas those based on solid solutions in the lead zirconate titanate (PbZrxTi1-xO3 \u2013 PZT) system \n[4].  These arrays are microsystem-type devices in which each pyroelectric element is \ninterfaced to its own integrated FET amplifier, these being linked by arrays of switches for \n                                                 \n* Corresponding author: Tel. +44 1234 754057, Fax +44 1234 751346, e-mail r.w.whatmore@cranfield.ac.uk \nmultiplexing.  These devices have been made possible through the flip-chip hybridisation of \nthin wafers of bulk materials (particularly ferroelectric ceramics) with silicon application \nspecific integrated circuits (ASICs) \u2013 known as read-out integrated circuits (ROICs).  They \nhave developed remarkable performances, and arrays have been demonstrated possessing \n388x284 elements and noise equivalent temperature differences of ca 140mK [2].  There has \nbeen an interest for a long time in the possible use of thin pyroelectric films, because of their \npotential for making low thermal mass elements [5].  Arrays that have been demonstrated \ninclude: linear arrays fabricated using bulk micromachining techniques with sputtered \nPbTiO3 on (100) silicon [6], La-PbTiO3 on MgO [7], P(VDF-TrFE) on silicon [8] and \nsputtered films of Pb(Zr0.15Ti0.85)O3 on (100) silicon [9], the latter for use in infra-red gas \nspectrometers [10].  In all these the bulk micromachining has been used to remove the silicon \nfrom behind the pyroelectric film, leaving a thin, low thermal mass membrane.  The \ndevelopment of fully integrated 2D arrays has been encouraged by the low temperature \n(<550\u00baC) growth of ferroelectric thin films such as PZT directly onto active silicon devices \n[11].  Surface micromachining is the preferred route for the manufacture of 2D integrated \narrays and single elements employing a polysilicon supporting membrane under a PbTiO3 \nfilm were demonstrated more than 10 years ago [12].  Workers have employed different \nstrategies to obtain good thermal isolation.  Koehler et al [12] have evacuated and sealed the \ncavity under the element.  Other groups [11] evacuate the whole package and use long legs \nsupporting the active element to provide the best possible thermal isolation.  Clearly, the \nsubject of integrated pyroelectric IR detector arrays covers a wide range of materials and \ndevice technologies.  This paper describes a new way in which the ferroelectric thin film and \nmicromachining technologies can be combined to produce a novel detector array concept \nemploying micromachined structures as radiation collectors to give a significant increase in \nsensitivity. \n2 Integrated Radiation Collectors \nThe basic concept of the non-imaging radiation collector has been described in \nconsiderable detail by Welford and Winston [13] and Winston et al [14].  The idea is to \ndefine a reflective re-entrant cavity with a shape such that as much as possible of the \nradiation entering through one aperture will emerge from a smaller aperture at the other end, \nbeing concentrated in the process.  The simplest concentrator is the light collecting cone [15] \nand this suggests a possible use for a bulk micromachined pyramidal cavity in silicon as a \nmeans for concentrating some of the radiation falling into the cavity onto a sensitive \npyroelectric area in the centre as shown schematically in Fig. 1, with a sensitive pyroelectric \narea at the centre of a supporting membrane at the base of the cavity.  The sensitive area can \nbe defined either by an absorber on the front of the membrane or by an electrode pattern, or \nby a combination of the two.  It is clear that radiation incident on the cavity can arrive at the \nsensitive area either by a direct path, or by reflection from the walls.  Geometry and the \nFresnel equations for reflection at a dielectric surface can be used to calculate the collecting \npower of a bare silicon cavity compared with one plated with, for example, reflective gold.  \nFig. 2 shows the variation of the ratio of the total radiation intensity to that arriving directly at \nthe sensitive area, plotted as a function of \u03c6, assuming that the off-axis angle is in the (110) \nplane.  (The parameters used in this example are m=65microns, s=22.5 microns with a 180 \nmicron thick silicon wafer.)  The model incorporates effects of obscuration of the sensitive \narea by the edge of the cavity (for \u03c6>ca45\u00ba) and the fact that for \u03c6>ca20\u00ba we progressively \nlose reflections from the walls.  We can average the relative intensity arriving at the sensitive \narea for all sagital angles, as also shown in Fig. 2, and conclude that for incident angles (\u03c6) up \nto 25\u00ba, the intensity of radiation arriving at the detector should be at least 50% greater with a \ncollector than without. \nThe pyramidal etch pit will thus work as a radiation collector, albeit a rather \ninefficient one.  However, Winston et al  [17] have shown that much greater collection \nefficiencies can be obtained by using a Compound Parabolic Concentrator (or CPC).  These \nauthors have analysed the properties of such cavities in great detail and their analysis will not \nbe repeated here.  However, the basic principle is shown in Fig. 3a.  The cavity is created to \nhave a parabolic cross section such that the focus of the parabola falls at the opposite edge of \nthe exit aperture.  In this case, well over 90% of the radiation falling into the entry aperture \nwithin a cone of semi-angle \u03b8 will emerge through the exit aperture.  To find the optimal \ndesign for the integrated collectors we have analysed the collection efficiency of various \nprofiles, using a two dimensional model.  A CPC was chosen with dimensions compatible \nwith the pitch of the array (500\u03bcm).  The CPC design has two degrees of freedom: in our case \nthe profile is determined by the choice of the entry aperture half-extent (a = 300 \u00b5m) and the \nexit aperture half-extent (a\u2019 = 75 \u00b5m).  An acceptance angle of 14.48 degrees results, \nmeaning that this CPC design would collect all radiation at the incidence angle (relative to \nthe normal to the CPC) within 14.48 degrees.  Since the full length of such concentrator is \n1452\u00b5m, truncation is necessary to reduce it to a conventional silicon wafer thickness.  The \nupper part of the CPC can be truncated without a major reduction in collection efficiency. In \nour design, the length was reduced to 580 \u00b5m (corresponding to the thickness of the Si \nwafer), leading to an entry half-aperture of 254 \u00b5m.  Models were made for versions of all \nprofiles compatible with a subsequent reduction of the active areas by etching into the \nmembranes thermally-isolated elements suspended on microbridges.  The theoretical \nperformances of the above profiles were assessed assuming ideally-reflecting surfaces. The \ncalculations were performed partly analytically (by identifying the boundary rays between \nregions of total rejection and total acceptance) and partly by ray-tracing.  First we considered \na CPC with acceptance angle equal to ~ 14.48 degrees.  We then compared its performance \nwith the truncated CPC and CPC\u2019s enlarged to permit the introduction of pyroelectric \nelements with extended legs.  The collection efficiencies of elliptical collectors (Fig 3b) were \nalso modelled.  These profiles were modelled on the average dimensions of collectors \nexperimentally achievable by pure SF6 dry etching (see below).  The results showed that the \nCPC always offered the maximum collection efficiency, giving factors of 3.5 to 4 increases in \npower, while the elliptical concentrators showed a significantly-poorer concentration power \nfor all cut-off angles, but even here a 2x increase should be achievable.  A schematic of the \ncomplete device structure is shown in Fig 4, including the design of the infra-red elements \nincorporating long microbridge legs for the purposes of thermal isolation.  The incident IR is \nabsorbed in a thin film absorber structure consisting of a 0.5 to 1\u03bcm thick layer of SiO2 \ncoated with 377\u03a9\/square NiCr on the IR absorbing face.  The SiO2 also supports the thin \nPZT pyroelectric layer which is deposited on a 5nmTi\/100nmPt, which doubles as the back \nelectrode for the pyroelectric and the reflector at the back of the thin film absorber. \n3 Radiation Collector Fabrication \nThe fabrication of the pyramidal collectors by wet chemical etching has been \ndescribed in detail elsewhere [16].  Here we will describe the fabrication of approximations \nto the CPC structures by dry etching.  Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etching has been \nextensively developed for the fabrication of structures in silicon with steep sidewalls [17].  \nThis process involves exposing the silicon sequentially to an SF6 plasma, followed by a step \nwhere the silicon is exposed to a passivating gas (C4F8).  Different approaches were taken to \nattempt to produce the ideal CPC profile.  \u201cGrey-scale\u201d lithography was used to define a \ncontour in a polymer mask, followed by standard unidirectional DRIE [18].  This was \nunsuccessful in that it could not produce the high aspect ratio structures required.  Partially \nanisotropic etching in which the ratio of etch to passivation time was varied produced deep \ncavities, but with very rough sidewalls.  A fully isotropic etch process was investigated, as \nshown in Fig 5a.  Here, the vertical etch rate was higher than the lateral etch rate.  The \ncavities were characterised by taking replicas with silicone rubber (PDMS) and some \nexamples of these are shown in Fig 5b.  The shapes are the result of a complex kinetic \nmechanism in a regime where the diffusion of the radicals to the etching front represents the \nslower step in comparison with the surface reaction. A large number of samples were \nproduced under different conditions of pressure and platen power: the contours produced \nwere all roughly similar in shape. In fact, for all the features produced, the etch factor \u2013 the \nratio between the etch depth (ED) and the undercut or lateral etch (EL) \u2013 lay between 1.7 and \n2.4 regardless of any process parameters or feature size.  SEM of cavity cross sections and \nreplicas offers a qualitative idea of the nature and extent of surface roughness (Fig 6), enough \nto estimate that this process offers a reasonable surface quality. The cavity roughness appears \nto be below one micron (rms), which is probably adequate for use as a reflector of 10\u03bcm \nwavelength radiation.  The typical dimensions of the profiles obtained in this way are only \napproximations to the ideal CPC profile, i.e. they can approximate the bottom of a CPC.  For \nexample, a cavity etched for ~ 4 hours in pure SF6 from an original aperture diameter of 85 \n\u00b5m in a 250 \u00b5m thick silicon wafer may approximate the bottom sixth part of the CPC with \u03b8 \n~ 14 degrees.  This is illustrated in Fig. 7.  If a second wafer were to be aligned and bonded to \nproduce an additional cavity on top of the first one, as also shown in Fig. 7, then about one \nthird of the CPC profile could be approximated.  Ray tracing software has been used to \ncalculate the relative increase in power that would be incident on the pyroelectric element at \ncollector exit aperture and the results are shown in Fig 8 in comparison with an ideal \ntruncated CPC of the same overall height.  These calculations assume a uniform irradiance \nover the collection angle indicated.  It can be seen that a single elliptical collector should \napproximately double the radiation power reaching the detector element while the double \ncollector should allow a further 50% increase.  An ideal CPC profile would allow a factor of \n4 increase in radiation power reaching the detector element. \n4 Device Fabrication and Testing \nSeveral sets of arrays of 16x16 elements on 500\u03bcm pitch were produced to the two \nbasic designs (pyramidal collectors and single elliptical collectors using the isotropic SF6 etch \nprocess).  Highly 111-orientated Mn-doped Pb1.1(Zr0.3Ti0.7)O3 (PM01ZT) films 700 ~ \n1000nm thick were prepared on the Pt\/Ti electrode by a chemical solution deposition method \nas has been described elsewhere [19, 20].  The properties and pyroelectric performances of \nthe films are given in Table 1, where FD is defined by \n\u03b4\u03b5\u03b5 tan' oD c\npF =  and p=pyroelectric \ncoefficient, c\u2019=volume specific heat, \u03b5=material permittivity, \u03b5o= permittivity of free space, \ntan\u03b4=material loss tangent.  Note that the dielectric properties are measured at sub-100Hz \nfrequencies, where any practical pyroelectric device will be used.  Several PZT compositions \nand processes were explored, including the use of Mn doping at levels between 0.02 and \n2mole %.   It was found that a 1% Mn doping level had a marked positive effect upon the \ndielectric and pyroelectric properties, leading to an excellent value of FD that considerably \nexceeds any value reported elsewhere for a thin film at such low frequencies.  The first \ndevices were a set using wet anisotropic etching in TMAH [16] to give pyramidal radiation \ncollectors as shown schematically in Fig 1.  Photomicrographs of these are shown in Fig. 9.  \nThe second set of arrays used DRIE employing isotropic etching in SF6, together with dry \netching of the membrane structure to fabricate thermally isolated detector structures in the \nbase of the collector.  Photomicrographs of these devices are shown in Fig 10.  The arrays \nwere tested by setting-up a demountable probe system which permitted contact to a selection \nof the array elements, which could be sequentially connected to a single output FET.  This \nwas shielded by a Ge window, through which the array was permitted to view an IR source (a \nhotplate held at 380\u00baC).  A rotating chopper was interposed between the source and the array.  \nTwo stages of collimation were used to restrict the angle over which the array elements could \nview the source.  Firstly, an aperture was placed at the chopper which restricted the angle of \nview to ca 25\u00ba.  (This was roughly equivalent to the acceptance angle corresponding to a f\/2 \nlens being used to image onto the array.)  Secondly, two sets of micro-collimator array were \nmade by using DRIE to etch sets of cylindrical holes in a 260 micron thick silicon wafer.  \nEach collimator in the first set was 125 microns in diameter, approximately the size of the \ndetector elements in the base of the collectors.  Each collimator in the second set was 410 \nmicrons in diameter.  By using the first set of collimators, clamped against the detector wafer, \nit was possible to restrict the radiation acceptance angle so that none fell on the collector side-\nwalls.  The second collimator was then used to allow the collector side-walls to come into \nplay in a well-controlled fashion.  In this way, it was possible to assess the efficacy of the \ncollector designs.  Both coated and non-coated collectors were assessed. \nThe results of these tests are summarised in Table 2.  Consider first the pyramidal \ncavity design.  Here, tests were carried out with the 410\u03bcm collimator.  An increase of 40% \nin response was seen when gold-coated sidewalls were compared with non-coated sidewalls.  \nThis is the first positive evidence that the collectors are performing as predicted.  The second \nset of tests involved comparing the responses of the detectors when looking through the \n125\u03bcm collimator arrays with the responses when looking through the 410\u03bcm collimator \narrays.  Here, it was found that the pyramidal collector performed slightly better than \nexpected, giving a factor of 7 increase in response.  The DRIE elliptical collector gave a \nresponse increase of 7 times, within experimental error of the prediction.  (In both cases, a \nfactor of 3.2 increase in response would have been expected if the collectors had been \nentirely non-functional \u2013 the increase being due to the larger collection aperture).  It has, \ntherefore, been demonstrated that the principle of the non-imaging radiation collector can be \ncombined with an array of pyroelectric elements and provide a useful increase in the power \nreaching an element.  In this case, a factor of two increase in power has been demonstrated \nfor radiation illuminating the array over a collection angle equivalent to a f2 lens.  This would \nbe expected to give an equivalent detectivity of about 4x108cmHz1\/2W-1 using the thermally-\nisolated element design employed in the final device. \nIt is clear that there is great scope for further work along the lines described here.  The \ncollectors made in these devices are non-ideal.  Their shape only approximates that of an \nideal CPC and a further factor-of-two increase in radiation power collected would be \nexpected if the ideal shape could be obtained.  Recent work using a \u201ctwo stage\u201d etch process \nhas shown some promise in this direction. In this [18], a vertical side-walled cavity is etched \nfirst and then opened-up with an isotropic etch process.  This is versatile, but requires \noptimisation to obtain the required profile.  The cavities made by dry etching are quite rough \nand it is probable that better performance could be achieved if much smoother surfaces could \nbe obtained.  Ultimately, a better approach might be to use a micro-machining process to \nfabricate a male mould and then to make the female cavities in plastic by micro-injection \nmoulding, following this with a metal plating process. \n5 Conclusions \nIn conclusion, the principle of integrating a radiation collector with a pyroelectric \ndetector array has been demonstrated successfully.  It has been shown that both pyramidal \nand hemi-elliptical collector cavities can be made in silicon substrates using wet and dry \netching respectively can be used to usefully collect the radiation falling onto a pyroelectric \narray and to concentrate this radiation onto detector elements placed at the cavity bases.  \n16x16 arrays have been made using a high-performance pyroelectric thin film material and it \nhas been demonstrated that both gave approximately a factor-of-two increase in signal. \n6 Acknowledgements \nThe financial support of EPSRC through grant number GR\/N06113\/01 is gratefully \nacknowledged.
