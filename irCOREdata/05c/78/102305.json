Despite the\ndecrease in band gap, the conduction band effective mass has\nbeen predicted to rise with increasing N content, contrary to\nthe expectation of usual k\u0095p theory.4,5 The strong band gap\nbowing and increase in effective mass have been explained\nby a band anticrossing model in which resonant localized N\nstates within the conduction band interact with the extended\nstates of the conduction band.6\u20139 The effective mass increase\nhas been determined by the plasma reflection technique and\nshown to be consistent with pressure dependent differential\nreflectivity measurements.4,5\nThis dramatic band gap bowing has also been observed\nin alloys of narrow gap semiconductors and we have previ-\nously measured both this, and the resulting suppression of\nAuger recombination in InNxSb12x using a time resolved\npump\u2013probe technique. We showed10 that for a given quasi-\nFermi level separation the Auger recombination rate is about\none third that of the equivalent band gap HgCdTe ~band gap\nbetween 10 and 15 mm!, and proposed that this is due to the\nhigher conduction band nonparabolicity.11 We here demon-\nstrate by direct measurement of cyclotron resonance ~CR! at\nhigh pulsed magnetic fields that the electron effective mass\nof InNxSb12x ~with 0,x,1%! is substantially higher than\nthat of InSb, and directly measure the band anticrossing ef-\nfect. Furthermore, we find that the increase in effective mass\nwith x value is in excellent quantitative agreement with a\na!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nb.murdin@surrey.ac.uk2560003-6951\/2002\/81(2)\/256\/3\/$19.00\nDownloaded 26 Feb 2008 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject ttight-binding calculation of the interaction coefficients.8\nThe band structure of InNxSb12x with small x can be\npredicted using a modified k\u0095p Hamiltonian previously de-\nveloped for GaNxAs12x .6,8 In this model, the energy of the\nnitrogen resonant level, EN and of the host conduction band\n~cb! edge energy, EC , both shift linearly with increasing N\ncomposition, x, while the repulsive interaction between reso-\nnant states and the cb edge increases as x1\/2. There are, in\naddition, x- and k-dependent terms for the interaction be-\ntween the nitrogen and valence bands, but these have been\nshown to be small even far from the zone center and we\nneglect them here.\nIncorporating a magnetic field in this approximation is\ntrivial, as the lack of k-dependent terms means there are no\nadditional raising and lowering operators, and hence no ad-\nditional warping terms which would couple Landau levels\nwith a different quantum number. In our case, because of the\nnarrow band gap of the host, even before the addition of the\nnitrogen, there is a strong k\u0095p interaction between the con-\nduction and valence bands, so we use the 838 Pidgeon and\nBrown ~PB! model12 as the basis:\nH5F EN1ax bAx 0 0 0bAx HCC1gx HCH HCL HCS0 HHC HHH HHL HHS0 HLC HLH HLL HLS\n0 HSC HSH HSL HSS\nG , ~1!\nwhere Hi j are the PB matrix elements between cb ~C!, light\n~L!, heavy ~H!, and spin\u2013orbit split off ~S! valence bands.\nFollowing PB, we assume kz50 and decoupling the spin-up\nand spin-down terms of the resulting 10310 Hamiltonian,\nwe have two 535 eigenproblems to solve.

The parameters a, b,\ng, and EN can be found by analyzing the results of a tight-\nbinding model.8 In the case of InNxSb12x , EG50.177 eV\n~[7 mm! at room temperature, and we calculate the nitrogen\nlevel energy, EN50.47 eV above the cb edge, a\n522.77 eV, b52.2 eV, and g50.0 eV.8,10\nAn example of the cb Landau level spectrum produced\nby this model with the aforementioned parameters, is shown\nin Fig. 1 for InSb ~i.e., with x50! and for an alloy with x\n50.8%. The first effect of increasing x is that the N-like\nband rises and the G-like cb drops in energy. The band gap is\npredicted to decrease by about 80 meV per percent N, a\nfractional change of 40%, as shown in Fig. 2. This clearly\noffers significant potential for long wavelength emission\/\ndetection from direct band gap III\u2013V materials. At the same\ntime as the band gap is reduced, the effect of mixing the\nlocalized nitrogen states with the G-like cb causes a very\nstrong anticrossing and tends to increase the effective mass.\nFIG. 1.

Calculated band gap energy for InNxSb12x alloys vs nitrogen com-\nposition x.\nDownloaded 26 Feb 2008 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tVery close to the zone center ~at energies less than a few tens\nof meV and fields below about 10 T!, the k\u0095p repulsion of\nthe valence band is stronger and the band edge mass de-\ncreases slightly, although this is only just discernable on the\nscale in Fig. 1. A few tens of meV above the cb edge, the\nnitride has a heavier mass than the binary. The only Kane\nbandstructure materials without nitrogen but with an equiva-\nlent band gap, HgxCd12xTe, have a much smaller mass than\neither the binary or the nitride.\nWe have performed pulsed field CR measurements on a\n2.4 mm thick epilayer of InNxSb12x nominally with x\n51.1%. The sample was grown by molecular-beam epitaxy\non a semi-insulating GaAs substrate and had a 0.4 mm buffer\nlayer\/virtual substrate of intrinsic InSb between the GaAs\nand the nitrided layer. The room-temperature n-type carrier\nconcentration resulting from nitrogen incorporation was\n3.8731017 cm23. The carrier mobility was of ;5500\ncm2V21s21, necessitating a high magnetic field and short\nwavelength to achieve the necessary CR observation condi-\ntion, vct@1. We have used the single turn coil technique at\nthe University of Tokyo which generates high magnetic\nfields with a very short pulse duration of 6 ms.14 The radia-\ntion sources for the high-field results were CO2 ~9.2 and 10.6\nmm! and CO ~5.5 mm! lasers.\nMagnetoabsorption results are shown in Fig. 3 at room\ntemperature for three different exciting laser wavelengths.\nThe structure observed near 10 T for 5.53 mm is the inter-\nband spin doublet from the undoped InSb buffer layer. The\nother peaks are the spin\u2013split CR of the n-type epilayer. The\ninterband structure is not observed for the nitride epilayer\ndue to the doping, which gives a Fermi level well above the\nband edge at a low field. Similarly, the CR is not observed\nfor the intrinsic InSb buffer as the total areal density of car-\nriers is two orders of magnitude less than for the nitride\nlayer.\nThe CR energies are plotted as a function of magnetic\nfield strength, together with the theoretically computed ener-\ngies for the aforementioned model in Fig. 4. The theoretical\nlines have been fitted to the data by varying only two of the\navailable parameters, x and EN . None of the InSb host pa-\nrameters were treated as adjustable, and are taken from Ref.\n13, along with the room-temperature band gap of 0.177 meV.\nUsing the InSb parameters, the two lowest left circularly\npolarized ~i.e., light hole! interband transitions are at 7.4 T\nFIG. 3.

Because of this, varying x\nand b have nearly the same effect @see Eq. ~1!#, and because\nof the uncertainty in the fraction of nitrogen atoms which\nend up substituting with Sb, we used x as a fitting parameter.\nThe calculation of Fig. 4 used x50.8%, and EN50.57 eV\nabove the cb edge.\nAt the highest photon energy, the spin-down line has\ndisappeared, or became weak and very broad ~there is possi-\nbly a vestigal feature at 130 T in Fig. 3!. This is due to the\nanticrossing with the nitrogen levels, which is reached first\nby the higher-energy spin-down transition. It should return to\nextended G-like character and reappear at higher fields. The\nspin-up line also anticrosses, at about 180 T.\nAn alternative explanation for the disappearance would\nbe that the quantum limit has been achieved, and the carriers\nhave all relaxed to the lowest spin state. We discount this as\nunlikely, since it has been shown in identical pulsed field CR\nexperiments on InAs quantum wells that both peaks of the\nspin doublet are normally seen on the up sweep, due to a\nvery slow spin relaxation time in comparison with the dura-\ntion of the field pulse.15\nFIG. 4. CR transition energy vs magnetic field.

Redistribution subject tThe effective mass of the 5.53 mm transition is 0.044, as\ncompared with 0.033 calculated for InSb at that energy. We\nnote that it is the effective mass at energies comparable with\nEg above the cb edge which is important in Auger recombi-\nnation. The heavier this mass, the slower the Auger rate, and\nthis is consistent with our earlier measurement10 of increased\nrecombination times in these materials.\nIn summary, we have performed very high-field\nmagneto-optical absorption measurements on InNxSb12x ,\nand have directly shown the influence of the nitrogen reso-\nnant states on increasing the electron effective mass.\nThe authors are grateful to EPSRC ~UK! for support and\nto E.
