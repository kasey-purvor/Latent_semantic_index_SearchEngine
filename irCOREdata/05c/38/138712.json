Introduction1\n2\nThe large body of evidence implicating spent lead gunshot in the primary lead3\npoisoning of waterfowl and the secondary lead poisoning of birds of prey (USFWS,4\n1986; Fisher et al., 2006) has lead to a rapid development of lead substitutes, especially5\nsince 1991 when the USA and Norway banned the use of lead shot for hunting waterfowl6\n(Beintema, 2001). To date, lead substitutes made from iron, tin, bismuth-tin, tungsten-7\nplastics, tungsten-bronze, tungsten-nickel-iron, tungsten-iron and other mixtures of these8\nmetals have been developed and approved for legal use in the USA and Canada (USFWS,9\n2006). The utility of tungsten in these forms of shot relates to its high density10\n(19.35g\/cm3) and the need to develop substitutes that approach the ballistic characteristics11\nof lead. The Canadian and US legal processes for regulating the composition of new12\nsubstitutes require that empirical evidence be generated from controlled toxicity tests13\nindicating that shot ingested by waterfowl do not pose a toxic threat to the birds14\n(USFWS, 1997). The need to demonstrate that a new candidate shot is non-toxic to other15\nlife forms in the environment is less stringent (Thomas and Guitart, 2003). Nations other16\nthan Canada and the USA lack any legal mechanisms to control the composition of lead17\nsubstitutes (Thomas and Guitart, 2003), whether used as gunshot or fishing weights. The18\nlegal approval of tungsten as a non-toxic component of gunshot is based mainly on avian19\nstudies conducted over at least 150 days and across two generations under conditions that20\nwould demonstrate pathologies and diverse toxic signs, were the material toxic (USFWS,21\n1997). Recently, based on studies of soil organisms, concerns have been raised about22\nthe toxicity of tungsten and certain tungsten alloys to components of the environment23\nother than waterfowl (Begley 2004; Dermatas et al., 2004; Strigul et al., 2005;24\n5Koutsospyros et al., 2006). Ogundipe et al. (2007) used these concerns as a basis for1\nquestioning the use of tungsten-based shot. Kalinich et al. (2005) implicated a tungsten2\nalloy in the generation of malignant tumours when implanted intra-muscularly in F3443\nrats. It has also been suggested that tungsten of geological origin might be involved in4\nthe cluster of childhood leukemias at Fallon, Nevada (CDC, 2003).5\n6\nIt has only been during the past decade that release of elemental tungsten to the aquatic7\nand terrestrial environment through game shooting has taken place, and independent,8\ndetailed studies of the environmental effects of tungsten are few compared to those of9\nother heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury. The purpose of this paper is to assess10\nthe risk posed by spent tungsten shot to organisms other than waterfowl and to investigate11\nwhether the putative carcinogenicity of tungsten is due to tungsten per se, or other metals12\nthat tungsten may be combined with in shot. Also, by comparing the amount of tungsten13\nthat would be released to the environment under the most extremely heavy shooting14\nconditions with levels of tungsten that Strigul et al. (2005) regarded as toxic, we can15\nbegin to assess the environmental risk posed by spent tungsten-based shot.16\n17\n2. Establishing the environmental conditions as the basis for comparison18\n19\nThe regulations applied by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1997)20\nestablished a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d for assessing the potential toxicity of a candidate non-21\ntoxic (non-lead) shot. In this, it is assumed that 69,000 shot of No. 4 size (3.07 mm22\ndiameter) will be dispersed over 1 hectare of soil to a depth of 5 cm, or over 1 hectare of23\nwater to a depth of 30.48 cm. Then, based on the percentage of tungsten (by mass) in the24\n6shot material, the Estimated Environmental Concentration (EEC) of tungsten can be1\ncalculated as the amount of tungsten in 500 m3 of soil, or 3048 m3 of water. The EEC2\nvalue assumes that all of the tungsten in the shot has been solubilized, that adsorption of3\ntungsten onto organic and inorganic fractions in both soil and water has not occurred, and4\nthat all of the tungsten is available biologically. The figure of 69,000 shot per hectare is5\nbased on known densities of spent shot in the most heavily shot-over regions of the USA.6\nIt represents a theoretical shot density meant to challenge the potential non-toxicity of7\nany lead shot substitute. Since this scenario can be applied to shooting situations world-8\nwide, it is the basis of the present comparison.9\n10\nTwo commercial tungsten-based shot types were used for the comparison. Tungsten-11\nmatrix shot comprises 95% tungsten by mass and tungsten-bronze shot comprises 51%12\ntungsten by mass. Both brands of cartridge are sold widely in North America, and they13\nrepresent the upper and lower levels of elemental tungsten in the non-toxic shot14\nformulations (Table 1). Given the mass of a single No. 4 tungsten-matrix shot as 213 mg,15\nthe calculated tungsten EEC for water is 4.44 mg\/L and, for soil, is 13.54 mg\/Kg, where16\nsoil has a mass of 2Kg\/L. The mass of 1 pellet of tungsten-bronze shot is 183.2 mg: the17\ntungsten EEC for water is 2.12 mg\/L and, for soil, 6.46 mg\/Kg.18\n19\nThe EEC for tungsten in other brands of tungsten-based shot can be calculated from20\ntheir gross composition (Table 1). Similarly, the tungsten EEC in soils of density other21\nthan 2.0 can readily be calculated, arithmetically.22\n23\n73. Comparison of EEC values with other studies reporting tungsten toxicity1\n2\nStrigul et al. (2005) reported that tungsten powders incorporated into soil at levels3\nexceeding 1% by mass induced changes in the soil community, such as death of bacteria4\nand an increase in the fungal population. The same study indicated that the degradation of5\nstarch applied to soil was inhibited completely when the soil contained more than 3%6\ntungsten by mass. This study also observed the effects of tungsten powders in soils on7\nthe survivability of earthworms, concluding that all the worms survived 14 days of8\nexposure to 10 \u2013 1,000 mg tungsten\/Kg soil.9\n10\nStudying the effects of tungsten on the survivability of soil bacteria, Strigul et al.11\n(2005) reported that, after three months, 95% of bacteria had died following exposure to12\nsoils containing 3% tungsten by mass. However, when highway soils were treated with13\ntungsten on a 1% and 0.01% mass basis, no significant toxic effects were observed at the14\n0.01% concentration (i.e. 100 mg tungsten\/Kg soil) after one year. Strigul et al. (2005)15\nalso reported that ryegrass germinated in soils containing 10% by mass tungsten died16\nafter one month. A threshold level of soil tungsten was identified as 0.1-1% by mass for17\ninhibition of ryegrass growth. The authors concluded from these results that elemental18\ntungsten in soils could have detrimental environmental effects above a threshold level of19\n1%. In studies on solubility, sorption and soil respiration of tungsten and tungsten alloys,20\nDermatas et al. (2004) reported that elemental tungsten added to soils above 3% by mass21\nadversely affected the respiration of soil microbes.22\n23\n8As previously detailed, the tungsten EEC levels for tungsten-matrix shot and tungsten-1\nbronze shot in a \u2018worst-case\u2019 scenario with the heaviest shot loading circumstances are2\n13.54 mg\/L, and 6.46 mg\/Kg soil, respectively. These two values \u2013 equivalent to3\n0.0014% and 0.0006% respectively \u2013 are far below the 1% and 3% by mass threshold4\nlevels that Strigul et al. (2005) and Dermatas et al. (2004) identified as being toxic to soil5\ncommunities.6\n7\nOgundipe et al. (2007) cited a study by Tajima (2003) to demonstrate the potential8\ntoxicity of tungsten. However, Tajima (2003) concluded that, based on the influence of9\nsoluble tungsten salts on the activity of the umuDc gene in E. coli, tungsten salts were10\nboth biologically and toxicologically inert. Tajima indicated that soluble tungsten salts11\nhave biological effects on E. coli, but did not equate these to toxicity. Sugio et al. (2001)12\ninvestigated the mechanism of the inhibition of growth of Acidithiobacillus ferooxidans13\nby sodium tungstate and observed that growth was inhibited in media where the salt14\nconcentration was 14.7mg\/L. This level is higher than the \u2018worst-case\u2019 tungsten EEC for15\nboth types of shot under consideration.16\n17\nUnder circumstances where tungsten becomes solubilized, there is a potential for18\ntungsten salts to become adsorbed onto organic and mineral components of both soil and19\nwater. Dermatas et al. (2004) reported that soil fractions readily adsorb tungstate salts in a20\nnon-reversible manner. Presumably, this would lower the soil EEC values for tungsten,21\ndepending on the degree of adsorption and affirm further the non-toxicity of spent22\ntungsten-based shot to soil organisms.23\n9It is informative to relate the \u2018worst-case\u2019 scenario tungsten EEC values to naturally-1\noccurring levels of tungsten in the environment. Senesi et al. (1988) measured the level of2\nnaturally-occurring tungsten in an array of soils and reported background levels between3\n0.2-2.4 mg\/L soil. Extrapolating from these levels, the heaviest tungsten soil loading from4\nspent shot at the most heavily shot-over sites would be, at most, five times the highest5\nbackground level. Quin and Brooks (1972a) measured tungsten in the soils around6\nagricultural lands in New Zealand, reporting levels of 1.9-21.4 mgW\/Kg soil. However,7\nin areas where the soils were heavily-mineralized, tungsten levels were much higher,8\nranging from 65-125 mgW\/Kg (Quin and Brooks, 1972b). The \u2018worst-case\u2019 tungsten9\nEECs for both brands of tungsten shot fall far below these levels. The federal10\ngovernments of Canada and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency do not have11\nstandards for tungsten in sludges or biosolids applied to soils (see USEPA, 1995).12\n13\n4. Potential toxicity of soluble tungsten in drinking water14\n15\nThe USA, Canada and the Member States of the European Union do not have potable16\nwater standards for tungsten. A number of independent studies have investigated the17\neffects of ingested soluble forms of tungsten in drinking water on different physiological18\nparameters. Rats given sodium tungstate at 200 mg\/L for 20 weeks did not exhibit19\nchanges in body weight or any notable histopathology (Luo et al., 1983). Giving rats20\ndrinking water containing 100 mg sodium tungstate\/L for three weeks produced no21\neffects on bodyweight or liver weight, nor effects on succinate-cytochrome c reductase122\nactivity (Cohen et al., 1973). Munoz et al. (2001) reported no deleterious effects on23\n1 A mitochondrial respiratory enzyme.\n10\ngrowth or on the liver and kidney of rats given drinking water containing 2000 mg1\nsodium tungstate \/L for two months. Schroeder and Mitchener (1975) reported that rats2\ngiven tungsten at 5 mg\/L in their drinking water for their entire life showed a slight3\nincrease in growth and a slight reduction in longevity.4\n5\nGiven that the \u2018worst-case\u2019 aquatic tungsten EEC for tungsten-matrix shot and6\ntungsten-bronze shot are 4.44 mg W\/L and 2.12 mgW\/L respectively, the above-cited7\nstudies on the effects on rats of drinking water containing much higher levels of sodium8\ntungstate indicate that concerns relating to the possible toxicity of animals\u2019 drinking9\nwater containing soluble tungsten derived from spent shot are unwarranted.10\n11\n5. Implicating tungsten in carcinogenicity12\n13\nWhile this review deals primarily with the fate of elemental tungsten in gunshot,14\ntungsten compounds of geological origin and other anthropogenic origins can enter the15\nhuman environment and the human food chain through potable water and other ingesta.16\nConcerns about a potential carcinogenic role of tungsten have arisen from tungsten17\ncompounds in drinking water (CDC, 2003) and the use of tungsten in ballistic heavy18\nmetal alloys (Kalnich et al., 2005) and have been used to question the presence of19\ntungsten in new types of gunshot.20\n21\n5.1. Carcinogenicity associated with tungsten in potable water22\n11\nThe deposition of gunshot in water bodies and wetlands by intense hunting pressure1\nacross years raises the possibility that tungsten could become mobilized from the shot2\nand become part of human potable water. In situations where such gunshot undergoes3\nslow disintegration on dry land, small particles of tungsten, either as metal or tungsten4\ncompounds, could reach humans and be inhaled or ingested. Kalinich (2005),5\nKoutsospyros et al. (2006), and Ogundipe et al. (2007) referred to a possible relationship6\nbetween tungsten in the environment of humans in Fallon, Nevada, USA and certain7\ntypes of leukemia in children. This occurrence of leukemia in children has been examined8\nin detail as to its possible cause(s), including (but not confined to) the presence of9\nelevated levels of soluble tungsten in the potable groundwater. Seiler et al. (2005)10\nidentified elevated levels of tungsten in ground water around Carson Desert, Nevada, and11\nattributed these levels to the natural erosion of tungsten bearing minerals in the local12\nwatershed, possibly reinforced by upwelling from deep warm waters. Sheppard et al.13\n(2006) measured both tungsten and cobalt levels in atmospheric particles from the Fallon,14\nNevada region, and suggested that they originated from a hard-metal processing plant in15\nNevada. Whatever the origin (natural and\/or anthropogenic) and form of the tungsten in16\nthe human environment, mention and examination of its potential carcinogenicity is17\nwarranted.18\n19\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that while tungsten was \u201ca20\npotentially unique exposure within Churchill County\u201d [i.e. Fallon], it was not identified21\nas the cause of the leukemia (CDC, 2003) and this Agency could not detect a statistically22\nsignificant relationship between exposure to ingested tungsten in drinking water and23\n12\nchildhood leukemia in Churchill County, Nevada (CDC, 2003). The Expert Panel on1\nChildhood Leukemia in Churchill County, Nevada (Expert Panel on Childhood2\nLeukemia, 2004) concluded that tungsten had likely been present in that environment for3\nmany years (from mining, a tungsten smelter and use of tungsten ammunition at a nearby4\nmilitary base) and could not link tungsten in the human environment to leukemia in5\nchildren. Furthermore, three major agencies, the U.S. Department of Health and Human6\nServices, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the International Agency for7\nresearch on Cancer, have not linked tungsten exposure with carcinogenic effects.8\nHowever, the U.S. National Toxicology Program has been advised to investigate further9\nall the potential effects of tungsten on animal health (ATSDR, 2005a, 2005b).10\n11\nDaughton (2005) suggested that the actual cause(s) of the leukemia remained to be12\nidentified and hypothesized that a range of other environmental agents could contribute to13\ncarcinogenicity. Rubin et al. (2007) re-evaluated the potential environmental causes of14\nthe childhood leukemia in Churchill County, paying special attention to tungsten15\nexposure. These authors could not establish, scientifically, any link between tungsten and16\nleukemia and indicated that the elevated tungsten levels in Churchill County were not17\nunique compared to adjacent regions in which exceptional incidences of leukemia did not18\noccur. However, a recent study by Sheppard et al. (2007) used dendrochemistry to19\nmonitor airborne metals in the environment around Fallon, Nevada. Cottonwood20\n(Populus sp.) trees revealed an increase in tungsten levels from the mid-1990s, and21\nincreased cobalt levels from an earlier time, but no temporal increases were seen in other22\nmetals. The authors recommended that the potential roles of tungsten and cobalt, in23\n13\ncombination, in the generation of tumours be investigated further, a recommendation1\nmade also by Sheppard et al. (2006).2\n3\n5.2. Carcinogenicity associated with ingested and muscle-embedded tungsten\u2013based shot4\n5\nTungsten-based shot can enter the body of animals and humans in several ways. They6\ncan be ingested directly as spent shot; they can enter the digestive tract when the tissues7\nof animals killed with tungsten-based ammunition are eaten, as in the case of predators8\nand humans, and the shot may enter the body from non-lethal gunfire and be carried in9\ntissues. The presence of shot in the body can have various toxicological consequences,10\nincluding acute toxicity, chronic inflammation and carcinogenicity, with different11\nphysiological circumstances determining the residency, solubility, excretion and potential12\ntoxicity of shot materials in the gut versus shot embedded in muscle2.13\n14\nIt is necessary to consider the variety of metals that may be combined with tungsten in15\ndifferent brands of commercial shot and the manner in which they are combined, since16\nthis may determine their bio-availability. Thus tungsten-bronze shot is a sintered mixture17\nof bronze powder and tungsten powder (Thomas et al., 2007), whereas tungsten-nickel-18\niron shot is a true alloy of these three metals. The physico-chemical interactions among19\nmetals in true alloys or sintered mixtures determines how quickly individual metals can20\nbe solubilized and exert their influence (Ogundipe et al., 2006).21\n22\n2 Note: Although testing of the (non)toxicity of some new types of shot by implanting them into the\nmuscles of ducks has been conducted, it is not a legal requirement of the US or Canadian regulations.\n14\nRingelman et al. (1993), Kelly et al. (1998), Mitchell et al. (2001a; 2001b; 2001c) and1\nBrewer et al. (2003) have shown that elemental tungsten, whether combined with plastics2\nor sintered or alloyed with other metals, does not pose a toxic threat to captive waterfowl3\nwhen ingested. It is upon these controlled studies that full, unconditional, approval of4\ntungsten-based shot has been given by the USA and Canada3. These studies required5\nhistopathological examination of the principal organs of mallard ducks to be examined by6\ncertified pathologists. Should any tumours have developed within the 30 or 150 day7\nperiod, legal approval would not have been given. In a separate study, tungsten-bismuth-8\ntin shot, when embedded in muscles of mallard ducks for eight weeks, did not produce9\nany adverse or toxic effects (Kraabel et al., 1996). To date, only the study by Kraabel et10\nal. (1996) has investigated the effect of embedding tungsten-based shot intra-muscularly11\nin the birds: all the other studies were performed with tungsten-based shot present in the12\ndigestive system.13\n14\nIn the study by Kalinich et al. (2005), tungsten-nickel-cobalt alloy pellets (W 91.1%:15\nNi 6.0%: Co 2.9%) implanted into the muscle of F344 rats induced potentially fatal16\nmalignant tumours, indicating that tungsten alloys are carcinogenic by this exposure17\nroute, a point raised also by Koutsospyros et al. (2006). Similar pellets made from nickel18\nalso produced tumours, but a tantalum control did not. Unfortunately, the Kalinich et al.19\n(2005) study did not contain a pure tungsten control and so it is not possible to determine20\nthe role, if any, played by tungsten itself in the generation of the tumours. The same21\ncaveat was noted by ATSDR (2005a). Kalinich et al. (2005) did suggest a possible22\n3Approval can be revoked should toxicity issues or other environmental problems arise during use of the\nnew shot.\n15\ncombined effect of all three metals and specifically alluded to possible evidence for1\nsynergism between nickel and cobalt.2\n3\nSeveral independent studies have investigated the long-term effects of pure tungsten4\ncoil implants, focusing on in vivo corrosion of the metal and any associated toxicity.5\nPeuster et al. (2003a, 2003b) implanted tungsten coil sutures in rabbit and human tissues6\nand examined their fate and possible toxicity. Peuster et al. (2003a ) concluded that while7\nthere was mobilization of tungsten from the suture coils implanted into humans, the rate8\nof mobilization was very low (29\u00b5g\/day). The results indicated no toxic effects in human9\nadult and pediatric patients despite elevated serum tungsten levels. In their 2003b study,10\nPeuster et al. implanted tungsten coils into the subclavian artery of rabbits and observed11\nthe effects four months later. The authors reported an increase in serum tungsten levels12\nfrom 0.48\u00b5g\/L before implantation to 12.4\u00b5g\/L four months after implantation. However,13\nthe dissolution of tungsten from the coils was not accompanied by any local or systemic14\ntoxicity. Corrosion of pure tungsten implants in humans and accompanying elevated15\nblood tungsten levels has also been reported by Butler et al. (2000) and Barrett et al.16\n(2000). However, both studies did not report toxic effects in patients many months after17\nimplantation. This line of research was continued by Bachthaler et al. (2004) in which18\npure tungsten implants were monitored in human patients over several years. These19\nauthors did not observe toxic effects in any patient with elevated blood tungsten levels.20\nHowever, Bachthaler et al. (2004) did caution against the use of such implants because21\nsuperior materials were available that did not undergo corrosion, and because the clinical22\nsignificance (if any) of elevated tissue tungsten levels remained to be determined.23\n16\n1\nThus there is no direct evidence that pure, elemental tungsten causes toxicity or2\ncarcinogenicity. Leggett (1997) developed a model to infer more about the distribution3\nand retention of tungsten in the human body and stated that while the data on this subject4\nare...\u201cweak and inconclusive, the occupational experiences and the available5\ntoxicological studies on laboratory animals suggest that tungsten may have a relatively6\nlow order of chemical toxicity. van der Voet et al. (2007) did not identify any specific7\nadverse effects attributable to tungsten in a review of this metal\u2019s clinical properties.8\nHowever, these authors stated, explicitly, the need to distinguish between elemental9\ntungsten and other heavy metals with which it is normally alloyed in inducing tumours,10\nand cited nickel and cobalt, specifically, as contributors to such risk. van der Voet et al.11\n(2007) reiterated the precautionary remarks of Butler et al. (2000) and Bachthaler et al.12\n(2004) about elevated levels of tungsten in human tissues and the need for more research,13\nboth on the toxic risks posed by the pure metal in the body, and the carcinogenic risks14\nposed by other metals\u2019 presence in tungsten alloys.15\n16\n5.2.1 Nickel in tungsten alloys: inflammation and carcinogenicity17\n18\nHoots et al. (2007) implanted shot made from nickel-coated steel, tungsten-polymer,19\ntungsten-iron and tungsten-nickel iron into the musculature of rats and observed the local20\nand systemic effects 26 weeks later. They found that the three tungsten-based shot types21\nproduced no neoplasms after 26 weeks. Nickel-coated steel shot underwent a22\nsignificantly greater corrosion than the other shot types and produced a marked local23\n17\ntissue inflammation three weeks after implantation, but not after 26 weeks. Severe1\ninflammatory reactions in rabbit muscle to implants of nickel-cobalt alloys were also2\nreported by Laing et al. (1967) and in rat muscle from implants of pure nickel and cobalt3\nby McNamara and Williams (1981). Uo et al. (2001) reported that nickel implants in rat4\nmuscles caused marked tissue damage at the sites of implantation and demonstrated that5\nnickel had the highest relative metal toxicity of all the metals tested. Thus there is strong6\nevidence for the inflammatory effects of implanted nickel, but not pure tungsten.7\n8\nSeveral independent reviews have established nickel and nickel compounds as9\ncarcinogenic. The National Toxicology Program (2005) found a number of studies that10\nrevealed the carcinogenic nature of nickel compounds, related to the slow release of11\nnickel ions that exert a genotoxic effect throughout the body. The review of Kasprzak et12\nal. (2003) cites evidence for the genotoxic and mutagenic activity of nickel ions,13\nespecially at higher tissue levels. Salnikov and Kasprzak (2005) indicated that a major14\nprerequisite for nickel toxicity is prolonged action at the tissue site, as might occur from15\nthe implantation of metallic nickel into muscle.16\n17\nMiller et al. (2000) showed that metallic nickel causes neoplastic transformation in18\ncultured cells. Miller et al. (2001; 2004) subsequently attempted to differentiate the19\npotential toxic effects of elemental tungsten, nickel and cobalt that are the principal20\ncomponent of military penetrators. In the 2001 in vitro study on human osteoblast cells,21\nMiller et al. measured a decrease in cell survival after five weeks exposure to tungsten,22\nnickel and cobalt powders in a dose-dependent manner. However the neoplastic23\n18\ntransformation of osteoblasts was far greater when cells were exposed to the tungsten1\nalloys. In a further experiment, Miller et al. (2004) observed dose-dependent activation of2\n13 gene promoters by tungsten, nickel, and cobalt, alone, but the effect was statistically3\nsignificant only at the highest dose levels. The genes induced are related to DNA damage4\nand the development of malignancy (Miller et al., 2004). As with the Miller et al. (2001)5\nstudy, the level of gene induction by each metal was far lower than in the tungsten-6\nnickel-cobalt alloy, indicating an apparent toxic synergy among the three metals. These7\nresults, added to those from the study of Kalinich et al. (2005) in which embedded nickel8\n(and nickel-containing) pellets produced malignant tumours in rats, indicate that9\nelemental nickel, whether alone or present in alloyed form with cobalt and tungsten, is10\ncarcinogenic.11\n12\n6. Discussion of pertinent findings13\n14\nThe assertion made by Ogundipe et al. (2007), that tungsten in the environment from15\ndischarged shot is toxic, has not been substantiated using the criteria of Strigul et al.16\n(2005) and Dermatas et al. (2004). Even where very heavy gunshot loadings from spent17\nlead shot may be expected and maximum dissolution and bioavailability of tungsten in18\nthe shot is assumed, the predicted amounts of tungsten in the soil fall far below the 1%19\nthreshold identified as toxic to soil organisms. This conclusion, based on extremely heavy20\nshot loadings by shooters, applies to commercial brands of tungsten-based shot21\ncontaining 51-95% tungsten by mass.22\n23\n19\nThe manner of soil deposition of metallic tungsten from shot and lead-free bullets1\nmade from tungsten may have an important bearing on claims of a toxic tungsten legacy.2\nThe studies of Dermatas et al. (2004) and Strigul et al. (2005) were prompted by high3\ntungsten levels in the soils at military rifle training ranges, not areas where gunshot from4\nhunting had fallen. Large numbers of soldiers fire many bullets during training, especially5\nduring rapid-fire situations. The bullets are stopped in earthen backstops and, should6\ntungsten remnants accumulate, they could readily exceed the 1% and 3% thresholds7\nidentified. Remediation of such training sites, involving the reclamation and recycling of8\ntungsten fragments, is possible because they are both readily-accessible and restricted9\ngeographically. By contrast, hunting with shotguns occurs across a far wider geographic10\narea, whether over upland or wetland sites, and so there is a greater dispersion of the non-11\ntoxic shot that leads to a far slower rate of metal accumulation at a given location.12\n13\nThe case for soluble tungsten, alone, in potable water causing childhood leukemia (as14\nin the Churchill County situation) has not been substantiated, despite considerable15\nscientific examination of this issue (Rubin et al., 2007). Dosing rats\u2019 drinking water with16\nsoluble tungsten salts under experimental conditions with amounts of tungsten far above17\nthe \u2018worst-case\u2019 aquatic EEC from shot has not led to tumour development.18\n19\nThe experimental testing in ducks of ingested tungsten-based (tungsten-iron and20\ntungsten-polymer) shot under the Tier 3 (150 days exposure across two generations)21\nprotocol (USFWS, 1997), by Mitchell et al. (2001a; 2001b; 2001c), did not report22\ncarcinogenicity, despite the solubilization of tungsten and its absorption into the23\n20\ncirculation. Tungsten-plastic shot is made from pure tungsten powder mixed with an inert1\nplastic and so relates most closely to the experimental testing of pure tungsten (as2\nopposed to shot types made from tungsten alloys). The results of testing ingested3\ntungsten-plastic shot in ducks are consistent with the results of Barrett et al. (2000),4\nButler et al. (2000), Peuster et al. (2003a; 2003b) and Bachthaler et al. (2004), in which5\npure tungsten coils were observed not to cause toxicity in both humans and rabbits. In6\nview of these results, it is suggested that tungsten-plastic shot and other tungsten-based7\nshot taken into the gut of scavenging birds and mammals, and humans who eat shot in the8\ntissues of game, will not cause adverse local or systemic effects.9\n10\nIn North America and Europe, many birds are wounded each year from non-lethal11\ngunfire from waterfowl hunters. The percentage of adult birds carrying shot in the body is12\ngiven as 29.1% and 20% for two Eider species (Somateria) in Greenland (Falk et al.,13\n2006). Hicklin and Barrow (2004) found that 25% of 1624 radiographed waterfowl of14\ndifferent species in Canada contained embedded shot. Tavecchia et al. (2001) reported15\nthat up to 29% of Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) captured in a given year in the16\nCamargue of France may contain shot embedded in the muscles. The incidence of17\nembedded shot in adult teal (Anas crecca) captured in the same locality was 7.5% for18\nfemales and 9.6% for males (Guillemain et al., 2007). The prevalence of embedded shot19\nappears to be greater for larger-bodied, and longer-lived, geese than ducks. Pink-footed20\ngeese (Anser brachyrhynchus) are hunted in Norway and Denmark and, prior to 1997,21\n25% of juvenile geese and 36% of older birds contained embedded shot in their muscles22\n(Noer et al., 2007). Forty-four percent of 45 trapped Greylag Geese (Anser anser)23\n21\nexamined by Mateo et al. (2007) in Spain carried embedded shot. Given that so many1\nmillions of waterfowl may live for years with lead shot in their body, it is important to2\ndetermine if the substitutes for lead shot may have a detrimental impact on the birds\u20193\nexistence beyond the initial wounding. From a management perspective, little gain in4\nwaterfowl survival is achieved if toxic lead shot is replaced by materials that, while non-5\ntoxic when ingested, pose risks of carcinogenicity when embedded.6\n7\nSome of the new brands of tungsten-based shot approved by the US government are8\nallowed to contain up to 40% by mass of nickel alloyed with tungsten (USFWS, 2006)9\n(Table 1). As suggested by Salnikow and Kasprzak (2005), a high-nickel-content shot,10\nslowly releasing ions from the site of shot implantation over months to years, might11\ncreate the conditions for genotoxicity and, indeed, the study of Kalinich et al. (2005) has12\nalready demonstrated the carcinogenic potency of both metallic nickel and a 6% nickel-13\ntungsten alloy implanted in rat muscle.14\n15\nIt is suggested that protocols for assessing the potential toxicity of lead shot16\nsubstitutes, such as that of the USFWS (1997), be amended to include provisions for the17\ntesting of candidate shot by intramuscular implantation to determine if prolonged18\ninflammation or tumour development occurs. Kraabel et al. (1996) investigated the19\neffects of embedding tungsten-bismuth-tin shot into the pectoral muscles of ducks after20\neight weeks (our italics), while Kalinich et al. (2005) showed that the imminent mortality21\nof rats from tumour development attributed to nickel occurred between weeks 23 and 3022\n(our italics) post-implantation. Moreover, the duration of regulatory testing for chemical23\n22\ncarcinogenicity is typically 18-24 months (our italics). Notwithstanding the likely1\ndifferences in response between birds and mammals, eight weeks may not be long2\nenough to detect possible long-term inflammation and\/or carcinogenic effects of metal3\nimplantation in birds. Certainly thirty-day testing, as required under Tier 2 conditions of4\nthe USFWS (1997) protocol, will not allow sufficient time; thus the testing of embedded5\nshot should be made part of Tier 3 conditions and the duration of embedding be made6\ncommensurate with the time required to demonstrate non-carcinogenicity of the shot7\nmaterials.8\n9\n7. Conclusions10\n11\nThe use of tungsten in lead-free shot is not associated with environmental toxicity,12\neven when such shot are present in soil and water at levels exceeding the heaviest known13\nshot burdens. The EEC tungsten levels for two brands of commercial shot containing14\n51% and 96% tungsten fall far below the 1% tungsten threshold that is associated with15\nimpacts on soil biota. Extensive medical investigation has not been able to implicate16\ntungsten in potable water as the cause of human leukemia in Nevada, USA. Tungsten is17\noften alloyed with nickel and cobalt, especially for use in military penetrators. Several18\nindependent chronic exposure studies have shown that elemental tungsten, whether19\ningested or implanted in muscle, does not produce tumours or any other pathological20\ncondition; however, the nickel present in such alloys is demonstrably carcinogenic when21\nimplanted into muscle. Many millions of waterfowl in Europe and North America carry22\nembedded shot in their body as a consequence of non-fatal shooting. The U.S. Fish and23\n23\nWildlife Service recently approved several types of shot that may contain up to 40%1\nnickel. It is appropriate for regulatory agencies to consider the inclusion of an embedded2\nshot (intramuscular implantation) treatment as a new component of the legal3\nrequirements when evaluating new \u2018non-toxic\u2019 shot candidates.4\n5\nAcknowledgements6\nThe scientific views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and may not reflect7\nthose of their institutions.
