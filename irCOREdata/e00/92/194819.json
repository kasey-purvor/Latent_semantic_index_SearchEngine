Introduction\nExtensive studies with different satellites have been performed\nduring the last decades to unveil the origin of the cosmic\nX-ray background radiation (XRB). In the 0.5\u20132 keV band,\nthe ROSAT deep surveys in the Lockman Hole (Hasinger et al.\n1998) resolved \u223c70\u221280% of the XRB into discrete sources\ndown to a flux limit of \u223c10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. The deepest\nChandra observations have now resolved \u223c90% of the soft\nXRB reaching a flux limit of \u223c2 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Moretti\net al. 2003).\nIn the hard X-ray sky, important contributions to the popu-\nlation studies were performed by the AS CA (Georgantopoulos\net al. 1997; Cagnoni et al. 1998; Boyle et al. 1998; Ueda\net al. 1998, 1999; Della Ceca et al. 1999) and BeppoS AX\n(Giommi et al. 2001) satellites. They resolved \u223c30% of the 2\u2013\n10 keV hard XRB (Ueda et al. 1998; Fiore et al. 2001) down to\nfluxes of 5 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. Chandra and XMM-Newton\nhave reached fluxes 100 times fainter, resolving \u223c50\u221270% of\nthe hard XRB (Mushotzky et al. 2000; Barger et al. 2001;\nFiore et al. 2001; Giacconi et al. 2001; Hasinger et al. 2001;\nTozzi et al. 2001; Baldi et al. 2002; Worsley et al. 2004).\nThe fraction of resolved X-ray background has recently been\nincreased to \u223c90% in the 2\u201310 keV and \u223c94% in the 0.5\u2013\n2 keV bands by Cowie et al. (2002) and Moretti et al. (2003),\nrespectively.\nOptical follow-up of the faint X-ray sources has revealed\nthat the bulk of the XRB is made up of type 1 and type 2 AGNs.\nThe results of optical identification programmes suggest that\nthe fractional contribution of type 2 AGNs is becoming increas-\ningly important towards fainter fluxes (e.g. Fiore et al. 2003).\nNow that the discrete origin of the XRB has been confirmed\nall over the X-ray energy band (0.1\u201310 keV), efforts are being\nconcentrated on the study of the source populations that make\nup the XRB. The nature and cosmic evolution of these sources\nis still controversial (Barger et al. 2002; Mainieri et al. 2002;\nFiore et al. 2003; Ueda et al. 2003).\nAt the faintest X-ray fluxes an important contribution to\nthe XRB emission is expected to come from type 2 AGN\n(Setti & Woltjer 1989; Gilli et al. 2001; Comastri et al. 1995).\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.aanda.org or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20041340\n856 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra of medium sources\nThis has been confirmed observationally (Mainieri et al. 2002).\nThe distribution of intrinsic absorption among the sources has\nonly been measured observationally for the brightest sources\nat low redshifts, but is still unknown at high redshifts. Recent\nChandra and XMM-Newton studies have revealed that the\nwidely accepted correlation between the optical obscuration\nand X-ray absorption (type 1 AGN being unabsorbed and\ntype 2 AGN being absorbed) is not always true. Several cases\nof type 1 AGN suffering from significant X-ray absorption have\nbeen found (Mittaz et al. 1999; Fiore et al. 2001; Page et al.\n2001; Schartel et al. 2001; Tozzi et al. 2001; Mainieri et al.\n2002; Brusa et al. 2003; Page et al. 2003; Carrera et al. 2004;\nPerola et al. 2004), as well as Seyfert 2 galaxies unabsorbed in\nX-rays (Pappa et al. 2001; Panessa et al. 2002; Barcons et al.\n2003).\nThe motivation for this work is to exploit the large col-\nlecting area and wide field of view (FOV) of XMM-Newton\nto perform a detailed spectral analysis of X-ray selected\nsources down to medium-faint fluxes. This study will al-\nlow us to put strong observational constraints on the aver-\nage X-ray spectral properties of the source population that\ndominates the X-ray emission at the flux level of our sur-\nvey, typically \u223c10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 0.5\u201310 keV energy\nband. Therefore we have conducted a large (total solid angle of\n\u223c3.5 deg2) and medium to deep (0.5\u201310 keV flux in the range\n\u223c10\u221215\u221210\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121) survey of sources detected with the\nXMM-Newton observatory in the 0.2\u201312 keV energy band. We\ntake advantage of an ongoing identification effort of sources\nin the fields under study, which enable us to obtain spectral\nproperties of representative samples of identified sources. This\nwork complements an earlier study of the X-ray spectral prop-\nerties of a large sample of sources at similar fluxes, but where\nthe count rates detected in the XMM-Newton standard energy\nbands (0.2\u20130.5, 0.5\u20132, 2\u20134.5, 4.5\u20137.5, 7.5\u201312 keV) were used\nto analyse the broad band X-ray spectral shape of the sources\n(Mateos et al. 2003).\nThe paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 describes the\nX-ray data and the current status of the identifications; Sect. 3\ndescribes the extraction of the X-ray spectral products; Sect. 4\ndescribes the results of the spectral fitting; Sect. 5 discusses\nthe average spectral properties of our sources; the X-ray spec-\ntral properties of sources identified as ALGs are described in\nSect. 6; Sect. 7 compares our observational results with spe-\ncific XRB synthesis models; the results of our analysis are sum-\nmarised in Sect. 8. Throughout this paper we have adopted the\ncurrently favoured concordance cosmology parameters H0 =\n70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121, \u2126m = 0.3 and \u2126\u039b = 0.7. The luminosity val-\nues that we use in the paper are the intrinsic luminosities of the\nobjects corrected for absorption. All one-parameter uncertain-\nties are computed with a delta chi-squared of 2.706, equivalent\nto 90% confidence region for a single parameter.\n2. Observations\nIn this study we use 25 observations selected from the pub-\nlic XMM-Newton data archive. They cover a total solid an-\ngle of \u223c3.5 deg2. To obtain a clean extragalactic sample\nof objects and to maximise the survey efficiency, the X-ray\nobservations were selected according to the following crite-\nria: sky positions at high galactic latitudes (|b| > 20\u25e6); ob-\nservations for which we had data from the European Photon\nImaging Camera (EPIC)-pn detector in FULL-FRAME MODE\n(i.e. the EPIC-pn full FOV covered). We avoided fields con-\ntaining bright point or extended targets where the wings of the\ntarget can reduce substantially the area of the survey covered.\nThe current analysis has been performed within the framework\nof the tasks of the XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre1.\nThe X-ray fields are listed in Table 1 together with their\nobservational details.\n2.1. X-ray data reduction\nAll the observations were processed through the XMM-Newton\npipeline processing system that uses a suite of tasks created\nspecifically for the analysis of XMM-Newton data, namely the\nScience Analysis System (Gabriel et al. 2004). The current ver-\nsion at the time of the analysis being v5.3.3. The pipeline pro-\ncess provides calibrated event files, images and exposure maps\nin five standard X-ray energy bands (0.2\u20130.5, 0.5\u20132, 2\u20134.5,\n4.5\u20137.5 and 7.5\u201312 keV) covering the energy range where the\ndata is best calibrated. The X-ray images are created with a\npixel size of 4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 4\u2032\u2032 and cover a FOV of \u223c30\u2032 diameter. The\nexposure maps give information on the spatial efficiency of\neach camera including the energy dependent mirror vignetting.\nThe pipeline products also provide source lists for each obser-\nvation and for each EPIC camera (pn, MOS1 and MOS2).\nThe source detection is run independently for each of the\nEPIC detectors, simultaneously on the five energy bands de-\nfined above. The area of the images where the sources are\nsearched for is defined by the SAS task emask, that creates\na map where CCD gaps and bad pixels\/columns are excluded.\nThe source detection process starts with the task eboxdetect\n(local mode) that performs a sliding box cell detection of\nsources with a minimum likelihood of detection of 8. This\nprovides an input list of source positions masked out by the\nSAS task esplinemap to build background maps for each de-\ntector and energy band. Eboxdetect (map mode) is run again,\nbut this time the background is taken from the maps created by\nesplinemap. This improves significantly the detection sensi-\ntivity. Finally the task emldetect performs maximum likeli-\nhood Point Spread Function (PSF)2 fits to the distribution of\ncounts of the sources detected by eboxdetect, obtaining for\neach object the total (0.2\u201312 keV) count rate and the likelihood\nof detections (total and on each energy band). For a description\nof the application of Maximum Likelihood analysis to detec-\ntion of sources see Cruddace et al. (1987).

Therefore, to opti-\nmise the sensitivity of the survey, we used the pipeline EPIC-pn\nsource lists. In the cases where we had more than one observa-\ntion for a field we used the source list of the deepest exposure.\nWe defined circular regions (with radius between 16 to\n160 arcsec), to exclude from the images the areas contami-\nnated by the emission of the targets. For the objects detected\nnear CCD gaps the uncertainties in their coordinates and flux\nmay be larger than the statistical uncertainties as given by\nthe pipeline products. In order to get rid of these sources\nwith somewhat uncertain source parameters, we have excluded\nzones near CCD gaps, widening them in size up to the radius\nthat contains 80% of the PSF on each detector point. We then\nused these masks to remove from the source list all the objects\ndetected close to CCD gaps. For each field and observation\nwe have examined the images searching for spurious sources,\nlike detections in hot pixels or bright segments not removed\nby the pipeline process. We have checked carefully detections\nclose to the tails of bright and\/or extended objects, that in most\ncases turned out to be spurious. The visual screening process\nremoved \u223c10% of the objects from the original list. The to-\ntal number of sources detected within these specifications was\n2145.\n2.3. Source detection sensitivity\nThe variety of data that we have used in our study, make it dif-\nficult to calculate the source detection sensitivity as a function\nof the X-ray flux, because in principle it depends on the expo-\nsure times of the fields and their Galactic absorbing columns,\nNH (Zamorani et al. 1988).\nThe XMM-Newton EPIC-pn detector is sensitive to X-\nray photons at energies ranging from \u223c0.2 to \u223c12 keV.\n858 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra of medium sources\nThe sensitivity is maximum between 0.5 and 4.5 keV, where\nit is almost independent of energy, i.e., objects with different\nspectral shapes are detected with similar efficiency. Outside this\nenergy interval, the sensitivity is a strong function of energy.\nBecause the band of detection of photons is wide, we do\nnot expect the use of fields with different NGalH (ranging from 1\nto 9 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122) to introduce any significant bias (e.g. detec-\ntions in the fields with the higher values of Galaxy absorption\nbiased towards hard3 spectrum sources) in the broad band spec-\ntral properties of our objects at the flux limits of our survey.\nHowever, we can see in Table 1, that the exposure times\nvary significantly from field to field. At 0.5\u201310 keV fluxes be-\nlow \u223c10\u221214 erg cm\u22121 s\u22121, where only a few fields contribute\nto the source list, we expect our survey to be biased against\nobjects with spectra peaking outside the 0.5\u20134.5 keV energy\nrange, for example highly obscured AGNs.\nTo build our source lists, the XMM-Newton source de-\ntection algorithm was run simultaneously in the five stan-\ndard XMM-Newton energy bands. Therefore we have analysed\nsources detected in at least one of these energy bands. This\nmight be important, because the sensitivity varies significantly\nfrom band to band, and hence, different source populations may\ncontribute at different flux levels.\nIn order to calculate the source detection efficiency func-\ntion, we have carried out simulations. A detailed descrip-\ntion of how we obtained this selection function is given in\nAppendix A. There is indeed a mild dependence of the selec-\ntion function on the spectral slope \u0393 at any given flux, and we\nwill correct for this effect.\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of our sources in bins of\n0.5\u201310 keV flux. The fluxes were obtained from the best fit\nmodel of each object (see Sect. 5.4). The selection of fields\nwith a range of exposure times results in a gradual reduction of\nthe sky coverage as we go to fainter fluxes, and is responsible\nfor broadening the flux distribution below \u223c10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121.\nOur sample is likely to be representative of the dominant X-ray\nsource population down to a flux of \u223c10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. For\ncomparison we have also plotted in Fig. 1 the distribution of\nflux for the sources with optical spectroscopic identifications.\nThe goal of the present paper is not to produce complete\nsource lists to build up source counts or luminosity functions\n(which will be the subject of a forthcoming paper), but rather\nto study the X-ray spectral properties of representative samples\nwithin the medium flux range, where it is known that \u223c50% of\nthe 0.5\u20132 keV (and\u223c40% of the 2\u20138 keV, see Bauer et al. 2004)\naccretion power in the Universe is produced. For this purpose,\nnone of the above possible biases in the source list has any\nsignificant impact on our results, after appropriate corrections\nare applied.\n2.4. Optical spectroscopic identifications\nThe selected fields are being followed-up in the optical band\nas part of the XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre XID\n3 We use the term \u201csoft spectra\u201d when the measured spectral photon\nindex, \u0393, is found to be \u223c2, the typical value for unabsorbed AGNs.\nWe consider a spectra to be hard if \u0393 \u2264 1.5.\nFig. 1.

The observ-\ning time was awarded by a project named AXIS4 (\u201cAn XMM-\nNewton International Survey\u201d, Barcons et al. 2002). The optical\nobservations consist of high quality multicolour imaging and\noptical spectra of the brightest sources (the optical observations\nand spectroscopic identifications will be described in detail in a\nforthcoming paper). This is an ongoing process, whose first re-\nsults were presented in Watson et al. (2001) and Barcons et al.\n(2002). The full list of identified sources will be made available\nvia the XMM-Newton Science Archive when completed down\nto a 0.5\u20134.5 keV flux of 2 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. Two identifica-\ntions in the A2690 field were from Piconcelli et al. (2002). For\nthe time being, \u223c11% (232) of the sources in our sample have\nbeen identified via optical spectroscopy. We have optical iden-\ntifications within all fields except one (MS1229), the fraction\nof identified sources per field ranging from \u223c1.4% to \u223c39%.\nThe objects were classified according to their optical emis-\nsion line properties. Sources with spectra showing strong broad\nemission lines (FWHM > 1000 km s\u22121) were classified as\nBroad Line AGNs (BLAGNs). If only narrow emission lines\nwere seen (FWHM < 1000 km s\u22121), the sources were classi-\nfied (purely in optical spectroscopic terms) as Narrow Emission\nLine Galaxies (NELGs). Objects with galaxy-like optical spec-\ntra and no apparent emission lines were classified as absorption\nline galaxies (ALGs), some of which are associated to clusters.\nTable 2 lists the number of identified sources, along with those\nwhich have good quality X-ray spectra (see below).\nOf all the identified sources, we have only analysed the\nspectra of BLAGNs, NELGs and ALGs.\nFigure 2 shows the redshift distributions of these sources.\nBLAGNs are detected up to redshifts of \u223c3, while at the flux\nlimit of our optical identifications we do not detect NELGs and\nALGs at redshifts above \u223c0.5. Similar distributions, at similar\nfluxes, have been found previously (e.g. Green et al. 2004 for\nthe ChaMP survey). In spite of the incomplete identifications,\nwe do expect the identified sources to constitute a \u201crepresenta-\ntive\u201d sample of the underlying population of sources at X-ray\nfluxes above\u223c2 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, where the identified frac-\ntion of objects is much higher (50%).\n4 http:\/\/venus.ifca.unican.es\/\u223cxray\/AXIS\/\nS.

Extraction of X-ray spectral products\nWe have cleaned the calibrated event files with the same fil-\ntering expressions that were used by the pipeline to create the\nEPIC X-ray images. This filtering removes time intervals con-\ntaminated by soft proton flares, cosmic ray tracks and spurious\nnoise events not created by X-rays. For each object in the cata-\nlogue the SAS task region was used to define the source and\nbackground extraction regions.\nThe source region shape was defined as a circle centred on\nthe source coordinates and with a typical radius of \u223c14\u221230\u2032\u2032,\ndepending on the source position within the detector. The back-\nground region was defined as an annulus centred at the source\nposition, with inner radius equal to the source extraction ra-\ndius and outer radius three times the inner radius. If there was\noverlap with nearby sources, the sizes of source and\/or back-\nground regions were reduced to eliminate the overlap. If nearby\nsources were inside the background region their extraction re-\ngions were excluded from the background region.\nSource and background spectra were then extracted with\nthe SAS task evselect. Single and double events were in-\ncluded for the pn detector and single-quadruple events for the\nMOS detectors in the energy band 0.2\u201312 keV. Further, only\nevents with the highest spectral quality (FLAG=0) were included\nfor the EPIC-pn data.\nFig. 3. Distributions of background subtracted counts (MOS+pn) for\nthe objects in our sample (solid histogram) and for the objects classi-\nfied as BLAGNs or NELGs (shaded dot-dashed histogram). The ver-\ntical line indicates one of the quality thresholds applied to the spectra.\nFor clarity, the last bin in the plots includes the spectra with more than\n500 counts.\nIn order to perform a proper spectral analysis, we created\nfor each source the redistribution matrix file (RMF) and the an-\ncillary response file (ARF), using the SAS tasks rmfgen and\narfgen respectively. To maximise the signal to noise ratio, we\nhave combined MOS1 and MOS2 source and background spec-\ntra and the corresponding response matrices. Merged source\nand background spectra were obtained by adding the individual\nspectra. Backscale values (size of the regions used to extract the\nspectra) and calibration matrices for the combined spectra were\nobtained weighting the input data with the exposure times.\nFor the fields with more than one observation, we added all\nthe MOS and pn data for each epoch but MOS and pn data were\nnot merged because of their different responses5.\nIn order to permit the \u03c72 minimisation technique in the fit-\nting process, the raw spectra were binned such that each bin\ncontained \u226510 counts (source plus background). We then im-\nposed two quality thresholds on the grouped spectra selected\nfor analysis: number of bins (MOS+pn) \u2265 5, and number of\nbackground subtracted counts (MOS+pn) \u2265 50.\nThis filtering process resulted in a final sample of\n1137 sources having X-ray spectra of sufficient quality to anal-\nyse them individually (see Table 2 for the distribution of iden-\ntified sources).\nFigure 3 shows the quality of the selected spectra as a func-\ntion of the 0.2\u201312 keV number of counts for the whole sample\nof sources (solid-line histogram) and for the objects identified\nas BLAGNs and NELGs (shaded histogram). The vertical line\nindicates the quality filter that we applied to select the spectra\nappropriate for the analysis. In Fig. 4 we present, as an ex-\nample, the X-ray spectra of some of the objects that we have\nanalysed.\n4. Spectral analysis\nThe data were fitted with the XSPEC (version 11.2) software\npackage. The spectral analysis has been carried out fitting\n5 See XMM-Newton handbook at http:\/\/xmm.vilspa.esa.es\n860 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra of medium sources\nFig. 4.

We consider a model not good enough if P(\u03c72) is less\nthan 5%.\nTo test the significance of additional input parameters the\nF-test has been applied with an adopted significance threshold\nof 95%. As is shown in Protassov et al. (2002), if the condi-\ntions to use the F-test statistic are not satisfied, the false posi-\ntive rate might differ from the value expected for the selected\nconfidence level. One of the conditions that must be satisfied, is\nthat the null values of the additional parameters, should not be\nin the boundary of the set of possible values of the parameter.\nWe are using the F-test to calculate the significance of detec-\ntion of absorption, and one of the possible values of the ab-\nsorbing column is zero. Hence, because one of the conditions\nfor using the F-test is not satisfied, we do not know whether the\nfraction of spurious detections in our data differs from the 5%\nexpected. To calculate this number, we carried out simulations\nof unabsorbed spectra, and then we calculated the number of\ncases where we detected absorption with a confidence level\nabove 95%. We have detected absorption in \u223c2% of the simu-\nlated spectra. As this fraction is not significantly different from\nthe expected value, we decided to be conservative, and hence,\nwe have continued with 5% as the number of spurious detec-\ntions, or false positive rates.\n4.1. Single power law (model A)\nWe have started the analysis fitting a single power law to the\nbackground-subtracted spectra, hereafter model A. This model\nhas two free parameters, the normalisation and the continuum\nslope \u0393. To account for the effect of the galactic neutral hy-\ndrogen absorption along the line of sight, a fixed photoelec-\ntric absorption component was included. The Galaxy H col-\numn density values for each field, NGalH , were extracted from\nthe HI map of Dickey & Lockman (1990). For the selected ac-\nceptance level, 139 (12%) objects had statistically unaccept-\nable fits with this model, the expected number for the selected\nconfidence level being 57. Within the sub-samples of identified\nsources, model A could not be accepted for 10 (7%) BLAGNs\nand 9 (31%) NELGs.\n4.2. Single power law with excess absorption\n(model B)\nSynthesis models of the XRB, based on AGN unification\nschemes (Setti & Woltjer 1989; Madau et al. 1994; Comastri\net al. 1995; Pompilio et al. 2000; Gilli et al. 2001) predict a\nlarge population of highly absorbed AGNs. Hence we expect a\nsignificant fraction of our objects to exhibit absorption in ex-\ncess of the Galactic value. An indication of absorption is to\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra of medium sources 861\nmeasure a flat spectral slope with model A. To study excess ab-\nsorption, we fitted a model with two local absorbers, one with\nthe column density fixed at the Galactic value and the other\none as a free parameter NobsH (model B). Note that this last term\nis essentially indistinguishable from an absorber with column\ndensity \u223cNobsH (1+z)2.7 (Barger et al. 2002; Longair 1992) at the\nredshift of the source, z, since absorption edges would not be\ndetected in our highly grouped, moderate signal-to-noise spec-\ntra. This model has three free parameters, the normalisation,\nthe continuum spectral slope \u0393, and the equivalent absorbing\ncolumn at z = 0, NobsH . The top panel in Fig. 5 compares the\nP(\u03c72) distributions obtained with model A with the results from\nmodel B for the whole sample of sources. We see that the num-\nber of unacceptable fits has been reduced by a factor of \u223c1.5,\nimplying the presence of intrinsically absorbed objects.\n4.3. Single power law with intrinsic absorption\n(model C)\nAs an alternative, more physical parameterisation of the ab-\nsorbing column of the BLAGN, NELG and ALG, we instead\nfitted photoelectric absorption at the redshift of the source\n(model C). The model has three free parameters, the normal-\nisation, the continuum spectral slope, \u0393, and the rest frame ab-\nsorption, NintrH . Figure 5 compares the results of the fits obtained\nwith model A and model C, for BLAGNs and NELGs. For a\ndetailed description of the spectral properties of the 7 ALGs\nanalysed, see Sect. 6. In the case of the BLAGNs, we did not\nfind a substantial improvement in the overall quality of the fits,\nsuggesting that the majority of the BLAGNs do not require in-\ntrinsic absorption in excess of the Galactic value. Therefore,\nfor the statistically unacceptable fits, more complicated models\nmight be needed to reproduce the spectra of these sources. On\nthe contrary, the observed significant improvement in the qual-\nity of the NELG spectral fits obtained with model C, suggests\nthat a large fraction of NELGs are intrinsically absorbed.\n4.4. Absorbed power law and soft excess (model D)\nThe soft excess has been shown to be a common feature of the\nX-ray spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies (Turner & Pounds 1989).\nThe physical origin of this emission is still unclear, since its de-\ntermination depends on a knowledge of the shape of the power\nlaw and the quantity of absorption. It has been interpreted as\nprimary emission from the accretion disc, gravitational energy\nreleased by viscosity in the disc, or as secondary radiation from\nthe reprocessing of hard X-rays in the surface layers of the disc.\nWe have searched for soft excess among the BLAGNs and\nNELGs. We first have fitted their spectra with a power law\nand a low energy black body component at the redshift of the\nsource, absorbed by the Galaxy. The soft excess emission, pa-\nrameterised as a black body, adds to the model two parameters,\nthe black body temperature and normalisation.\nWe have compared the \u03c72 of the fit with the values obtained\nwith model A to search for the cases where the significance\nof a \u03c72 improvement was above 95%. From the 170 sources\nanalysed (141 BLAGNs and 29 NELGs) we found evidence\nFig. 5. Comparison of the null hypothesis probability distributions,\nP(\u03c72), obtained from model A (simple power law, solid lines) and\nmodels B and C (observer frame absorbed power law and rest frame\nabsorbed power law models, dashed lines). From top to bottom: whole\nsample of sources, BLAGNs and NELGs.\nof soft excess emission in 12 sources (\u223c7%), 10 BLAGNs and\n2 NELGs.\nAs explained before, if soft excess is present in the spec-\ntra of the objects, it must be modelled properly to prevent the\ncontinuum spectral slope \u0393 and\/or the intrinsic absorption NintrH\nbeing incorrectly determined. Therefore we have analysed the\nX-ray spectra of these 12 sources in more detail. All the spectra\nhave a large enough number of bins, 35 < bins < 317, to use a\nmodel with five free parameters: a power law and a low energy\nblack body component, both absorbed by the Galaxy (NGalH ;\nfixed) and by absorption (NintrH ; free) at the redshift of the\n862 S.

The continuum shape\nAlthough we know that a large fraction of sources in our list\nare absorbed, we have started the study with the results that\nwe obtained with model A to allow comparison with spectral\nanalyses of data with low signal to noise. This model, as was\nexplained before, does not take into account the effects of ab-\nsorption or soft excesses.\nTo calculate the objects average photon index, \u3008\u0393\u3009, we have\nused the standard formula for the weighted mean,\n\u3008\u0393\u3009 =\n\u2211\nPi \u00d7 \u0393i\nwhere the weight, Pi, of each individual best fit value, \u0393i, is a\nfunction of the error obtained from the fit, \u03c3i,\nPi =\n1 \/\u03c32i\u2211 (\n1 \/\u03c32i\n) \u00b7\nTo calculate the uncertainty in \u3008\u0393\u3009 we have used the standard\ndeviation (Bevington 1992)\n\u03c32 =\n1\n(N \u2212 1)\n\u2211\nPi \u00d7 (\u0393i \u2212 \u3008\u0393\u3009)2\nthat includes the measurement errors, \u03c3i, and the dispersion of\neach \u0393i from the estimated value \u3008\u0393\u3009.\nFollowing these definitions, we find our sources to have\na continuum emission, from 0.2 to 12 keV, with an average\nslope of \u3008\u0393\u3009 = 1.86 \u00b1 0.02 (the arithmetic mean being 1.70 \u00b1\n0.02). To study the dependence of the objects average spec-\ntrum on the X-ray flux, we have calculated the values of \u3008\u0393\u3009\nin bins of 0.5\u20132 and 2\u201310 keV flux (each bin containing the\nsame number of objects). Figure 6 shows the results that we\nhave obtained. We see that the average spectrum of the sources\nbecomes harder with decreasing 0.5\u20132 keV flux, with \u3008\u0393\u3009 going\nfrom 2.01 \u00b1 0.03 at \u223c4.4 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 to 0.95 \u00b1 0.12\nat \u223c10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. This trend6 (harder sources at fainter\n0.5\u20132 keV fluxes) has been found in previous X-ray spectral\nanalyses (e.g., Vikhlinin et al. 1999; Mittaz et al. 1999; Tozzi\net al. 2001; Mainieri et al. 2002). Its origin is still not clear, al-\nthough it could be explained as a rapid increase in the intrinsic\nabsorption of the objects with decreasing flux, as it is predicted\nby some AGN synthesis models (see Gilli et al. 2001).\nIt is not possible to see the same effect using the 2\u201310 keV\nfluxes, where \u0393 seems to become softer at fainter fluxes (see\nFig. 6). It is important to note that this softening of \u0393 is not a\nreal property of our objects. It comes from using different en-\nergy bands simultaneously in the source detection. As we go to\nfainter 2\u201310 keV fluxes, it is more difficult to detect sources\nwith flat spectral slopes (hard objects) because their spectra\npeak at energies above \u223c2 keV where we know the sensitiv-\nity of the X-ray detectors decreases rapidly. Hence, the num-\nber of objects only detected in the soft band becomes more\nimportant at fainter 2\u201310 keV fluxes, specially below \u223c2 \u00d7\n10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. Note that the last bin at the faintest fluxes\n(see Fig. 6) is located at a value of \u3008\u0393\u3009 of more than 2.5. The\nobjects that contribute to this bin have spectra with very few\ncounts and therefore the values of \u0393 are poorly constrained.\nWe have studied in more detail whether the observed hard-\nening of \u0393 with decreasing soft flux could be affected by any\nbias introduced during our analysis. We first have checked that\nthe same result is obtained when only sources with more than\n150 counts (circles in Fig. 6) are used. Therefore, the sources\nwith poor spectral quality are not introducing any bias in our\nresult.\nWe expect the majority of the observations that we have\nused, not to be deep enough as to detect sources with a\n0.5\u20132 keV flux of \u223c10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the soft band. Hence,\nit could be possible that our \u3008\u0393\u3009 becomes harder with decreas-\ning flux partly due to the contribution to each bin from bright\nhard sources not detected in the soft band. This can be checked\nby repeating the plot of Fig. 6 with those sources selected in\nthe soft or hard bands (detection likelihoods above 10 on each\n6 The same dependence, i.e., hardening of \u3008\u0393\u3009 at fainter 0.5\u20132 keV\nfluxes, is observed if \u3008\u0393\u3009 is calculated with the arithmetic mean, there-\nfore the result is not an artifact of the weighted mean.\nS.

Weighted photon index versus S 0.5\u22122 keV from model A (simple\npower law) for sources with detection likelihood \u226510 in the 0.5\u20132 keV\nband (squares) and for sources with detection likelihood \u226510 in the\n2\u201310 keV band (circles). Error bars correspond to 90% confidence.\nband). The results, plotted in Fig. 7, show a very similar de-\npendence of \u0393 with flux. Only the \u3008\u0393\u3009 of the bin at the faintest\nsoft fluxes in Fig. 6, could be affected or even dominated by\nthe contribution of bright hard sources not detected in the soft\nband. It is interesting to note that the hardening of \u0393 is more im-\nportant for objects detected in the 2\u201310 keV band (see Fig. 7).\nIf absorption is producing the hardening of \u0393, this result sug-\ngests that we are seeing the same population of objects in the\nsoft and hard bands, the only difference being that the objects\ndetected in the 2\u201310 keV band are more absorbed on average.\nFinally we have used the source detection efficiency func-\ntion, W(\u0393, S) (see Appendix A), to correct our results for all the\nbiases of our study. The de-biased average values of \u0393 at each\nbin of flux were obtained weighting each individual value, \u0393i\nwith the function:\nPi =\n1 \/\n(\n\u03c32i \u00d7W (\u0393i, Si)\n)\n\u2211\n1 \/\n(\n\u03c32i \u00d7W (\u0393i, Si)\n)\nwhere the sum is calculated with all the sources falling in the\nspecified bin in the \u0393, S plane (for a detailed explanation see\nAppendix A).\nThe results are shown in Fig. 8, the left plot for the whole\nsample of sources, and the right plot for the sources detected in\nthe soft band. For comparison we have calculated the \u3008\u0393\u3009 values\nweighted with the fitting errors in the same flux bins (stars in\nthe plots). We still see the hardening of \u3008\u0393\u3009 with the 0.5\u20132 keV\nflux, so this dependence is indeed a real property of the popu-\nlation of the sources analysed.\n5.2. Excess absorption\nThe fit to the X-ray spectra with a single power law (model A)\nyields a large number of sources with statistically unacceptable\nfits. Models B and C reduce significantly the number of unac-\nceptable fits as it is shown in Fig. 5, suggesting that a substan-\ntial fraction of our sources could be X-ray absorbed, in agree-\nment with the predictions of the standard synthesis models of\nthe XRB (Comastri et al. 1995; Gilli et al. 2001).\nTable 3.

The errors are 90%.\nb F is where P(f \u2265 F) = 0.9973 (3\u03c3).\nTo search for absorbed objects we used the F-test, measur-\ning the improvement in the \u03c72 of the fits after adding absorption\nto the model. A 95% confidence cutoff is adopted for absorp-\ntion to be detected. In Table 3, we show the total number of ob-\njects of different types, the number of absorbed objects of that\ntype, and the fraction of absorbed objects of each type with its\nuncertainty and significance.\nFor a sample of N objects, of which n are absorbed, the\nBayesian posterior probability of the fraction of absorbed ob-\njects is P( f ) \u221d ( f + fspu)n(1 \u2212 f \u2212 fspu)N\u2212n (from the bino-\nmial distribution), where fspu is the fraction of spurious de-\ntections (for our sources 5%). We used the mode of P(f) to\nestimate the fraction (corrected from spurious detections) of\nabsorbed objects within each class of sources. The errors in the\nfractions were calculated integrating P(f) from the mode value\nin the two directions until we obtained 45% of the probability\n(90% errors). For every \u201cclass\u201d of sources, we measured the\nconfidence of detection of absorption integrating the P(f) dis-\ntributions from f = 1 down to the value where the integral is\nequal to 0.9973 (or 3\u03c3). These values, listed in the last col-\numn of Table 3, indicate the fraction of absorbed objects that\nwe have detected within each class of sources with a signif-\nicance of more than 3\u03c3. For example, we know with a confi-\ndence of more than 3\u03c3 that at least \u223c1% of BLAGNs and\u223c17%\nof NELGs are absorbed.\nIt appears that the fraction of absorbed objects varies sub-\nstantially among different classes of object, with the NELGs\nhaving the highest fraction. We have used the method de-\nscribed in Stevens et al. (2005) to study whether our samples\nof BLAGNs and NELGs have different fractions of absorbed\nobjects. Assuming that BLAGNs and NELGs come from the\nsame parent population, the fraction of absorbed objects is\nP( f ) \u221d\n(\nf + fspu\n)(n+m) (\n1 \u2212 f \u2212 fspu\n)(N+M\u2212n\u2212m)\nwhere M and N are the number of sources in the two samples\nand m and n the number of detections on each sample.\nThe probability of detection of i objects in the first sample\nand j in the second one is given by\nP(i, j; N,M) =\n(\nM\nj\n)(\nN\ni\n) \u222b 1\n0\nd f P( f )\n(\nf + fspu\n)(i+ j)\n\u00d7\n(\n1 \u2212 f \u2212 fspu\n)(N+M\u2212i\u2212 j)\n.\nThe fractions of absorbed objects in BLAGNs and NELGs\nwill be different if the probability of detecting \u2264m in the\nfirst sample and \u2265n in the second one is low, i.e. if\n864 S.

We find that\nP(m \u2264 16, n \u2265 13; 141, 29) = 0.000013. Therefore we see\nthat the fraction of absorbed objects in BLAGNs and NELGs\nis different with a significance of more than 3\u03c3. We cannot\ndistinguish the fraction of absorbed objects among NELGs\nand ALGs (the probability of them being different is not\nsignificant).\nFigure 9 shows the intrinsic NintrH distributions measured for\nthe absorbed BLAGNs and NELGs. BLAGNs show column\ndensities 4.5 \u00d7 1020 < NintrH < 2.3 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 while NELGs\nseem to cover a much wider range of absorption, with 1.1 \u00d7\n1021 < NintrH < 1.7 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122. However, the small number\nof objects does not allow us to find a significantly different (in\nterms of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) distribution of absorb-\ning columns between BLAGNs and NELGs.\nTo be confident that the detected intrinsic absorptions\namong identified sources were not affected by the quality of\ntheir spectra, we have plotted \u0393 versus NintrH to search for any\ncorrelation between the two spectral parameters. Such a corre-\nlation would be expected if the detections of absorption were\nspurious and linked to very large values of \u0393. The results are\nFig. 10.

The plot shows no apparent correlation be-\ntween \u0393 and NintrH .\nA Kolmogorov-Smirnov comparison between the redshift\ndistributions of unabsorbed and absorbed BLAGNs does not\nindicate a significant difference between the two. The same re-\nsult is obtained when comparing the 2\u201310 keV luminosity dis-\ntributions of absorbed and unabsorbed BLAGNs and NELGs\n(we use the 2\u201310 keV energy band because it is less affected by\nabsorption). We conclude that X-ray absorption does not occur\npreferentially at any particular redshift (in BLAGNs) or X-ray\nluminosity.\nFinally, we have tested whether the lack of optical broad\nemission lines in unabsorbed NELGs can be explained in terms\nof AGN\/host galaxy contrast (Lumsden et al. 2001; Moran\net al. 2002; Page et al. 2003; Severgnini et al. 2003). To this\nend, we have compared the 2\u201310 keV luminosity distributions\nof two sub-samples of unabsorbed BLAGNs and NELGs de-\ntected with redshifts ranging from 0.17 to 0.7, where the red-\nshift distributions of BLAGNs and NELGs overlap (see Fig. 2).\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov significance of the two distributions\nbeing different is \u223c99%.

Therefore, we have\nseen that our unabsorbed NELGs are on average significantly\nless luminous than unabsorbed BLAGNs at similar redshifts,\nand hence, our data are consistent with the explanation of non\ndetection of broad optical lines in unabsorbed NELGs as an\nAGN\/ host-galaxy contrast effect.\n5.3. Soft excess\nWe have previously shown that \u223c7% of the sources identified\nas BLAGNs or NELGs exhibit significant soft excess emis-\nsion. To measure the broad band spectral parameters of these\nsources, and in particular the underlying power law index \u0393 we\nhave used model D, as described in detail in Sect. 4.\nThe results of the fits are listed in Table 4, where for each\nsource we have included its IAU-style XMM-Newton source\nname, the optical classification, redshift, and the spectral pa-\nrameters measured with model D. We have also included the\nsoft excess contributions to the flux and luminosity in the soft\nband and the F-test results obtained from the comparison of \u03c72\nfrom model A to \u03c72 from model C and model D. We now dis-\ncuss some particular sources in detail:\nXMMU J001831.7+162924, XMMU J222823.6-051306,\nXMMU J212904.5-154448: we obtained an improvement in\nthe spectral fits with model C, but the F-test significance was\nin all cases below 95%, therefore the sources were classified\nas unabsorbed. A proper modelling of the soft excess emission\nwith model D allowed us to find significant absorption above\nthe Galactic value in all the sources.\nXMMU J221515.1-173224: we obtained an unusually\nsteep spectral slope with model A, \u0393 = 2.67+0.05\u22120.06. The qual-\nity of the fit did not improve significantly with model C. With\nmodel D we obtained a significant improvement in the fit\n(>99.99%). This model did not require absorption in excess\nof the Galactic value. The measured temperature of the soft\nexcess emission was kT = 0.05+0.03\u22120.01, below the typical values\nfound for the rest of the sources. The fitted continuum was\nstill significantly steep, with \u0393 = 2.60+0.04\u22120.11.We tried to find a\nmore typical value of \u0393 fitting the continuum slope at high en-\nergies (>2 keV) with model A. We obtained a value of \u0393 sig-\nnificantly lower, 2.06+0.37\u22120.35 and in agreement with the average\nspectral slopes observed in unabsorbed AGN. With \u0393 fixed to\nthe above value the fit did not improve with model C, but with\nmodel D we still obtained an F-test significance of >99.99%.\nThe model did not require absorption in excess of the Galactic\nvalue, therefore we believe the improvement is due entirely to\nthe soft excess component. We adopted this model as the best\nfit model for the source although the \u03c72 of the fit was slightly\nworse that the value obtained with \u0393 fully variable.\nXMMU J061730.9+705955: we found a significant col-\numn density with model C, hence the source was classified\nas absorbed. However we obtained a very steep spectral slope,\n\u0393 = 2.87+0.35\u22120.31. With model D we obtained a better fit of the data\nand more typical values for the spectral parameters, although\nmodel D did not require intrinsic absorption. We have chosen\nmodel D in preference to model C for this source.\nIt is interesting to note that for some of the sources that\nwe have analysed, we found very flat spectral slopes with\nmodel A, but they all required significant quantities of soft ex-\ncess emission. This is the case for XMMU J12226.1+752616\nand XMMU J222823.6-051306, with measured model A spec-\ntral slopes of \u0393 = 1.52+0.04\u22120.04 and \u0393 = 1.78+0.11\u22120.11 respectively.\n5.4. Results from best fit model\nTo test whether the spectral hardening observed using model A\nis due to an increase in intrinsic absorption at the faintest fluxes,\nwe compared \u0393 (from the best fit model in terms of the F-test re-\nsults) to the soft X-ray flux for each source. The best fit model\ncan be model A or model B for the unidentified sources, and\n866 S.

Using the best fit model for each object we obtained a\nvalue of \u3008\u0393\u3009 = 1.96 \u00b1 0.01 (the unweighted value was 2.08 \u00b1\n0.04). The dependence of \u3008\u0393\u3009 with the soft flux is plotted in\nFig. 11, where we see that:\n1. The average continuum of absorbed sources is significantly\nsofter than the continuum of unabsorbed sources, espe-\ncially at the faintest fluxes, with \u3008\u0393\u3009 = 2.15 \u00b1 0.04 (the\nunweighted value being 3.12 \u00b1 0.127) for the absorbed\nsources and \u3008\u0393\u3009 = 1.94 \u00b1 0.01 (the unweighted value being\n1.79 \u00b1 0.02) for the unabsorbed sources.\n2. There is no hardening of the average spectral slope for the\nabsorbed sources. The hardening of \u0393 seen in these objects\nwhen fitted with the SPL model is likely to be an effect of\nabsorption only.\n3. For the sources where absorption was not detected in terms\nof the F-test, we still observe a significant hardening of the\naverage spectral slope with the X-ray flux.\nSince the sources where absorption is detected do not exhibit\nany significant variation of the underlying spectral index with\nflux, does this hold true for the remaining sources? We first\nwanted to check whether any effect could lead to an apparent\nflattening of the spectral shape towards fainter fluxes when ab-\nsorption is included in the fitting model. To this goal, we have\ngenerated a number of fake spectra with an underlying power\nlaw \u0393 = 2 at various fluxes spanning those of our sample, and\ndifferent amounts of absorption at z = 0.\nWe have then first fitted these spectra with models A and B,\nand then we have compared the \u03c72 of the fits with the F-test. We\nfound a range of low values of NobsH where absorption was not\nsignificantly detected when model A was replaced by model B\n(F-test < 95%). In these cases, the best fit value of \u0393 (i.e., the\nvalue obtained with model A) was indeed lower than the input\none, and it can reach values in the range \u0393 \u223c 1\u20132.\n7 The unweighted mean is very high and different from the value\nthat we obtained for the weighted mean, because there are a number\nof absorbed objects for which \u0393 > 2.5 but with large errors bars.\nFig. 12. \u0393 versus S 0.5\u22122 keV for objects with flat spectrum (\u0393 positive\nerror bar <1.5). We have grouped the objects in terms of the number\nof bins in their pn spectrum.\nA second result of this exercise is, if we hold the absorption\nin the simulated spectra but vary the flux, at fainter fluxes the\ntypical values of \u0393 fitted are marginally harder than at higher\nfluxes (and then fitted values of NH tend to be lower than the\ninput ones). We believe this effect to be due to a degradation of\nthe spectral resolution of the X-ray spectrum, produced by the\nnecessary grouping in very wide bands to achieve the desired\nstatistics (10 counts\/bin). This leads, in particular, to a smooth-\ning of the model count rate function (which is the effective area\ntimes the input spectrum, convolved with the redistribution ma-\ntrix) in the whole spectral range, but in particular in the vicin-\nity of its peak at soft energies where most of the counts are\ndetected. This produces an undesired slight hardening of the\nspectrum.\nHowever, this effect is unlikely to produce the hardening of\nthe unabsorbed sources that we see. The reason is that in this\ncase we should see the lowest quality spectra (i.e., those with\nthe smaller number of bins) being more prone to this effect,\nbut this is not the case. Figure 12 shows the sources that we\ndetect in the real sample with flat spectra (best fit \u0393 error bar\nupper limit below 1.5), grouped in terms of the number of bins\nin their EPIC-pn spectra. We clearly see that the hardening is\nnot correlated with the quality of the spectra, and therefore the\nabove effect does not dominate.\nWe conclude that the hardening towards fainter fluxes is\nreal. This still leaves two options for its origin: intrinsic flat-\ntening of the power law or undetected low level absorption.\nAlthough the current data do not allow us to distinguish be-\ntween them, there is nothing inconsistent with the simplest hy-\npothesis which is that these sources are absorbed at a level\nwhich is undetectable in the current data.This is also sup-\nported by the results of Fig. 6 (right plot) where we do not\nsee hardening of \u0393 with the 2\u201310 keV flux down to \u223c2 \u00d7\n10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. If absorption is producing the hardening ef-\nfect that we see in our objects, then we do not expect to see the\nsame effect using 2\u201310 keV fluxes, because they are less af-\nfected by absorption. However, deeper observations are needed\nto assess this point for sources at fluxes similar to those of the\nsources in our sample.

Both sub-samples of sources exhibit the same depen-\ndence with the soft X-ray flux as shown in Fig. 13. We still\ndetect a clear correlation between the spectral slope and the\nsoft X-ray flux.\n5.5. Photon index intrinsic dispersion\nIn all the above analysis we have observed a clear dispersion in\nthe measured spectral slope of our objects, even within the sub-\nsamples of BLAGNs and NELGs, with the largest scatter in \u0393\nbeing observed for the NELGs. To test whether the observed\nscattering is intrinsic to the sources we have followed the pro-\ncedure described in Nandra & Pounds (1994) and Maccacaro\net al. (1988), where the distribution of source spectral indices\nis assumed to be well reproduced by a Gaussian distribution\nof mean \u3008\u0393\u3009 and dispersion \u03c3\u3008\u0393\u3009. The best estimates of \u3008\u0393\u3009\nand \u03c3\u3008\u0393\u3009 are obtained with the maximum likelihood (ML) tech-\nnique. We have calculated the distribution of the spectral slopes\nthat we obtained from the best fit model for the whole sample\nand the sub-samples of BLAGNs and NELGs. The results are\nshown in Table 5. In all the classes we measured a significant\ndispersion in spectral slopes. The large error in \u0393 obtained for\nNELGs did not allow us to differentiate the average spectral in-\ndex of NELGs from that of BLAGNs. We see that the mean\nvalues of \u0393 computed with the ML and the weighted mean\nare very different, in particular for the NELGs. The reason is\nthat with the ML method objects with untypical \u0393 (i.e. outliers)\nand not very large errors will increase the dispersion of the fit-\nted gaussian distribution rather than significantly affecting the\nmean.\nOur results do not show any trend in the underlying power\nlaw of the NELGs to be harder than that of the BLAGNs even\nTable 5.

Our data shows that the spectral differences\nbetween these two classes of sources are due mostly (if not\ntotally) to differing amounts of absorption rather than to dif-\nferences in the underlying power law spectra. Therefore many\nobjects classified as NELGs may contain active nuclei.\nFigure 14 shows the \u3008\u0393\u3009 versus \u03c3\u3008\u0393\u3009 contour diagrams for\nthe sub-samples of BLAGNs (solid lines) and NELGs (dashed\nlines), clearly showing the existence of an intrinsic dispersion\nin \u0393 with a confidence of more than 3\u03c3.\n5.6.

Error bars correspond to 90% confidence level.\nFig. 16. \u3008\u0393\u3009 versus redshift for BLAGNs. We have used the values of \u0393\nfrom the best fit model for each object (i.e. with absorption and soft\nexcess if required). Error bars correspond to 90% confidence level.\nWe have studied the redshift distribution of the mea-\nsured rest frame absorbing column densities for the absorbed\nsub-samples of BLAGNs and NELGs. The results, shown in\nFig. 17, show no evidence of evolution of NintrH with redshift.\nHowever, the ranges of the 2D parameter space that we fully\nsample with our source list are unclear.\nWe expect the minimum detected absorption to increase\nwith z. This can be easily explained in terms of absorption be-\ning redshifted towards lower energies and further decreased by\na factor (1 + z)2.7 as we move upwards in z.\nTo study if there exists a maximum detected column (only\nthe brightest sources being actually detectable when heavy ab-\nsorption is present), and if this limit depends on redshift, we\nhave carried out simulations as follows. A 3D parameter space\nwas defined with the axes being redshift, luminosity and in-\ntrinsic (rest-frame) absorption. For each parameter we have de-\nfined a grid of values covering the observational limits estab-\nlished by our sources. First, for each point in the NintrH -z plane\nwe simulate a spectrum for each BLAGN or NELG source in\nour sample, using its spectral response matrices and exposure\ntime and assuming \u0393 = 2. As explained in Sect. 3 we have\nonly analysed those spectra with more than 50 counts (back-\nground subtracted). We use this limit to calculate the required\nFig. 17. Intrinsic absorption as a function of redshift for absorbed\n(F-test significance \u226595%) BLAGNs (triangles) and NELGs (circles).\nminimum luminosity for each source to fulfil this constraint.\nLuminosities lower than this one would produce a spectrum\noutside our quality bounds.\nSecond, for a number of luminosities above this limit (still,\nfor each value of intrinsic absorbing column and z) we simu-\nlate a spectrum for every source. These spectra were analysed\nfollowing the same procedure that we used for the real spectra\ngiving a full coverage of the above 3D parameter space.\nWe then examined the fitted values of NintrH as a function of\nredshift z for a range of luminosities. The simulations confirm\nthat the minimum detection of absorption depends strongly on z\nfor the reason explained above. We also found two limits to the\nmaximum absorption detected as a function z. The first one is\nthe source detection itself: heavy absorption reduces signifi-\ncantly the flux of the source and makes detection very difficult,\nespecially at high redshifts. The second limit is the detection\nof absorption: even if the source is detected, if its luminosity\nis not high enough we will measure an absorption below the\nmaximum value established by the detection limit.\nThis strong dependence on luminosity and redshift makes it\nvery difficult to derive the real absorbing column distribution in\nterms of the fitted values. The best way we found to tackle this\nproblem is to compare our results with the predictions of spe-\ncific models for the distribution of absorbing columns, folding\nthe input values through the same effects as the real data. This\nis discussed in Sect. 7 in the framework of unified AGN models\nfor the XRB.\n6. ALGs X-ray spectra\nThe objects with galaxy-like optical spectra not showing emis-\nsion line signatures were classified as absorption line galax-\nies (ALG).\nThe inferred high X-ray luminosities obtained from the\nanalysis of their X-ray spectra strongly suggests that an AGN\nis the source of the X-ray emission in at least 5 out of the 7 ob-\njects. The peculiar properties of these objects have been ex-\nplained by a very high column density that would be obscur-\ning the AGN broad and narrow line regions. This hypothesis\nhas found observational support, because many of the ALGs\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra of medium sources 869\nstudied have been found to be X-ray obscured (Mainieri et al.\n2002; Comastri et al. 2002). However there are several exam-\nples of ALGs for which the obscuration model does not apply.\nIn these cases other possible explanations have been suggested,\ne.g. that a BL Lac could be present in the core of some ALGs\n(Brusa et al. 2003). Alternatively some objects might host an\nAGN with a non-standard accretion disk (Yuan & Narayan\n2004). A final possibility is that some ALGs may have normal\n(unabsorbed) AGNs that could be hidden if the host galaxy is\nbright enough (Severgnini et al. 2003; Page et al. 2003).\nWe now describe the X-ray spectral properties of the ALGs\nfound in our list:\nXMMU J122017.7+752216 is an optically normal galaxy\nthat looks extended in the X-ray image. Its soft X-ray emission\nis best reproduced with a thermal model with temperature kT =\n0.64+0.04\u22120.04 keV and metallicity Z = Z\n. The fit does not improve\nleaving Z as a free parameter. However, the high energy X-ray\nspectrum is best modelled with an unabsorbed power law of\nspectral slope \u0393 = 1.87+0.12\u22120.11. We cannot confirm whether the\nsource of the hard X-ray emission is an AGN due to the low\nvalue of the hard X-ray luminosity inferred from this model\n(L2\u221210 = 3.1 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121).\nThe nature of XMMU J021822.1-050612 was studied in\ndetail by Severgnini et al. (2003). They found the X-ray spec-\ntrum to be best modelled with an absorbed power law.\nThe X-ray spectra of XMMU J010320.2-064157 and\nXMMU J084211.6+710145 were best reproduced with an\nobscured (F-test values 99.7% and 95.0%) AGN with \u0393 =\n2.39+1.36\u22120.96, NH = 4.9\n+5.28\n\u22122.53 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and L2\u221210 = 2 \u00d7\n1044 erg s\u22121 for the first object, and \u0393 = 1.82+0.16\u22120.15, NH =\n9.3+8.5\u22126.8 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 and L2\u221210 = 3.88 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 for the\nsecond object.\nXMMU J214041.3-234719 has an unabsorbed X-ray spec-\ntrum with \u0393 = 2.08+0.09\u22120.08 and L2\u221210 = 6.2 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121. Hence,\nfrom its X-ray spectrum alone, we would expect this source to\nbe a BLAGN optically, rather that an ALG, according to the\nsimplest AGN unified model.\nA simple power law model can reproduce the spectra\nof XMMU J233113.6+20056 (see Fig. 18) and XMMU\nJ122312.6+75247, but the best fit spectral slopes were found\nto be well below the typical value found for unabsorbed AGNs\n(\u0393 = 0.94+0.26\u22120.27 and \u0393 = 1.36+0.30\u22120.28). In terms of the F-test none of\nthe spectra required absorption in excess of the Galactic value,\nalthough with the absorbed model we obtained more typical\nspectral slopes. The low quality of the spectra has not allowed\nus to study in more detail whether the spectra of these sources\nis intrinsically flat or absorbed.\n7. Testing population synthesis models\nThe standard population synthesis models of the XRB, based\non unification schemes for AGN, can reproduce successfully\nthe XRB with an appropriate mixture of unobscured and ob-\nscured AGN, as well as a number of observational constraints.\nThe input parameters of these models are the type 1 and type 2\nmeasured X-ray spectra and cosmological evolution, which is\nassumed to be identical. The X-ray luminosity function of ab-\nsorbed objects is still unknown, but it is assumed to be the same\nFig. 18. Top panel: MOS+pn spectrum of the absorption line galaxy\nXMMU J233113.6+20056 at z = 0.378. The X-ray spectrum was best\nfitted with a flat (\u0393 \u223c 0.944) unabsorbed power law. Bottom panel:\noptical spectrum of the source, where no obvious broad lines were\ndetected.\nas for unabsorbed objects. The ratio of absorbed to unabsorbed\nAGN comes out to be rather large in these models. A key de-\nscriptor of these models is the distribution of absorbing column\ndensities among the sources. The NintrH distribution is now ob-\nservationally known for the local Seyfert galaxies (e.g., Risaliti\net al. 1999), and in general these models assume it to be inde-\npendent of redshift and luminosity.\nThe analysis that we have conducted has allowed us to mea-\nsure the distribution of absorption in one of the largest samples\nof BLAGNs and NELGs studied up to now, and its cosmic evo-\nlution over a wide range of redshifts (see Figs. 9 and 17). In\nSect. 5.6 we reported that the measured absorption is slightly\nlower than the real one, depending on the luminosity and red-\nshift of the source. Hence, in order to compare the predictions\nof XRB models to our data, we assume an input distribution\nfor NintrH (independent of luminosity and redshift), and then fold\nit through the same detection effects as in our data.\nWe have used the NintrH distributions adopted by Comastri\net al. (1995), Gilli et al. (2001) and Pompilio et al. (2000), as in-\nput parameters to their analytical models of the XRB. We have\nsimulated spectra for each one of the BLAGNs and NELGs\n870 S.

Right: NintrH as a function of sources\u2019\nredshifts from simulations.\nincluded in our list, by fixing their redshifts, exposure times,\nposition and luminosities. The slope of the continuum was as-\nsumed to be \u0393 = 2 for all the sources. For each source we\nextracted NintrH values from the specific model distribution, un-\ntil the simulated spectrum fulfilled the quality filters that we\nused for the real spectra (binned spectra with at least 5 bins and\nsource net counts above 50). Indeed, heavily obscured sources\ndo not pass, just as happens for real sources. We fitted the spec-\ntra with model A and model C and computed F-test signifi-\ncances for absorption, using the same calibration matrices.\nFigure 19 compares the values of NintrH measured in the real\ndata and in the simulations for one of the XRB models (Gilli\net al. 2001). Obviously, the adopted distribution is not able to\nreproduce the observational results. Very similar graphs are ob-\ntained for the models of Comastri et al. (1995) and Pompilio\net al. (2000). For all three models there is a clear excess of\nsources with intrinsic absorptions NintrH \u2265 1022 cm\u22122, which\nare not present in the real data. For an F-test confidence level\nof \u226595% we detect, in our real sample, absorption in 29 sources\nout of 179. The number of absorbed sources detected in the\nsimulated data sets were 79, 67 and 71 for the Comastri et al.\n(1995), Gilli et al. (2001) and Pompilio et al. (2000) distri-\nbutions, in all cases a factor of more than 2.5 over the ob-\nserved value. This result is also evident from Fig. 19 (right\npanel), where the predicted distribution of absorbing columns\nwith the Gilli et al. 2001 model is plotted against redshift. We\nfind excess of absorbed objects all over the redshift interval\nup to redshifts of \u223c2. Discrepancies between the predictions\nfrom synthesis models and what it is obtained from observa-\ntions have been observed previously (i.e. Piconcelli et al. 2002;\nCaccianiga et al. 2004; Georgantopoulos et al. 2004; Perola\net al. 2004).\nIn the recent \u201cmodified unified scheme\u201d of Ueda et al.\n(2003) the AGN absorbing column density distribution de-\npends on luminosity (not redshift dependence). The fraction\nof absorbed AGNs (NH > 1022 cm\u22122) decreases significantly\nwith luminosity. This model will reduce the observed discrep-\nancies fundamentally at high luminosities, and therefore at high\nredshifts. However, this model predicts a significant fraction of\nobjects with NH > 1022 cm\u22122 at the typical luminosities of our\nsample that we do not detect. The Ueda et al. (2003) model,\nalthough more in line with our results, still overpredicts the\nnumber of absorbed objects (NH > 1022 cm\u22122) especially at\nlow redshifts.\nOne possible caveat is that some of these absorbed sources\nthat we do not detect in the real spectra might be hiding within\nthe unidentified sources. Our simulations indicate that \u223c40%\nshould have detectable absorption. However, even for the full\nsample of 1137 objects we only detect absorption in 10\u201320% of\nthem. Assuming that the redshift distribution of the identified\nsources does not strongly deviate from the true one (and there\nis evidence that this is the case from other surveys), then 40%\nof absorbed sources predicted by the simulations should also\nbe found in the whole sample, while only \u223c20% are seen. This\nconfirms that XRB synthesis models predict twice as many ab-\nsorbed sources at our flux levels than we actually observe.\n8. Conclusions\nWe have conducted a detailed analysis of the broad band spec-\ntral properties of a large sample of sources detected serendip-\nitously with the XMM-Newton observatory. Various spectral\nmodels have been tested to reproduce the 0.2\u201312 keV emission\nof our sources. We summarise our main conclusions as follows:\n1. Fitting the spectra of all the sources with a single power\nlaw we obtain a weighted mean of \u3008\u0393\u3009 = 1.86 \u00b1 0.02, in\nagreement with previous surveys. However, for a signifi-\ncant number of sources, the quality of their fits was very\npoor, with 7\u201312% of the sources having statistically unac-\nceptable fits (null hypothesis probability <5%).\n2. We observed the continuum average spectral slope to be-\ncome harder with decreasing 0.5\u20132 keV flux. This effect\ndoes not appear to be correlated with the quality of the\nspectral data. After correcting for all the biases that could\nbe affecting our results, we still see the same dependence,\ntherefore the hardening of \u0393 with decreasing soft flux is\nreal.\n3. Many objects in our sample exhibit absorption in excess\nof the Galactic value. In terms of the F-test (95% con-\nfidence level), excess absorption is found in 17% of\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra of medium sources 871\nsources. Significant fractions of X-ray absorbed objects\nwere found among NELGs (\u223c40%), BLAGNs (\u223c6%) and\nALGs (\u223c40%). This result clearly suggests that the rela-\ntionship between optical identification and X-ray spectral\nsignatures is still unclear and needs some revision.\n4. The distributions of absorbing columns in BLAGNs and\nNELGs do not appear significantly different within the\nlimitations of our sample, except for the overall factor\nthat NELGs are 4 times more frequently absorbed than\nBLAGNs.\n5. The typical absorption columns derived for BLAGNs\n(NH < 1022 cm\u22122) indicate that perhaps the host galaxy,\nor some sort of weak distant absorber might provide the\nabsorbing gas, without blocking too much the line of\nsight to the Broad-Line region. This point deserves further\nexploration.\n6. Using the best fit model for each object, i.e., including ab-\nsorption and soft excess when required by the data, we still\nobserve a substantial hardening of the average spectral in-\ndex towards fainter soft fluxes. The same effect was also ob-\nserved for the sub-samples of BLAGNs and NELGs. With\nthe current data quality, we cannot reject that these sources\nhave the same underlying power law (\u0393 \u223c 2) with moder-\nate absorption, nor can we reject that there is a population\nwith genuinely flatter spectral index. However when hard\nfluxes are used to study this effect there is no evidence of\na change of average spectral slope. This supports the hy-\npothesis that absorption is producing the hardening of the\naverage spectra of our sources, because hard band fluxes\nare less affected by absorption.\n7. Using a maximum likelihood fit we have detected an in-\ntrinsic dispersion of the spectral slope, even within the sub-\nsamples of BLAGNs and NELGs, with the largest scatter-\ning observed for the NELGs.\n8. We did not find a tendency of absorbed BLAGNs to occur\npreferentially at any particular redshifts. The same result is\nobtained when comparing the 2\u201310 keV luminosity distri-\nbutions of absorbed and unabsorbed BLAGNs and NELGs.\nTherefore, no evidence is found of unabsorbed BLAGNs\nand NELGs having different X-ray luminosities to the ab-\nsorbed objects.\n9. We have seen that our unabsorbed NELGs are on average\nless luminous than the unabsorbed BLAGNs and hence our\ndata are consistent with the explanation of the lack of broad\nlines in the optical spectra of unabsorbed NELGs as an\nAGN\/ host-galaxy contrast effect.\n10. A soft excess component was detected with a high signifi-\ncance in \u223c7% of BLAGNs and NELGs.\n11. For XRB synthesis models based on the AGN unified\nscheme, simulations were conducted to test the distribution\nof absorbing columns from these models on the population\nof BLAGNs and NELGs. In general, the number of sources\nwhere absorption was detected in the simulated spectra (in\nabout \u223c40% of them) was a factor of \u223c2.5 above the mea-\nsured values for all models. Regardless of the incomplete-\nness of the identifications, the XRB synthesis model pre-\ndiction of detectable absorption in 40% of the sources is at\nodds with the overall observed rate of absorbed sources in\nthe real sample.\n12. The distribution of absorbing column densities predicted\nby the synthesis models and measured through the simu-\nlations is significantly skewed towards high column den-\nsities NintrH \u223c 1022\u22121024 cm\u22122. These highly absorbed\nsources, predicted by the XRB models at our flux levels,\nare not detected in our sample of objects.\nAcknowledgements.

We know it\nwill be a function of the X-ray flux, but it is important to know\nwhether it also depends on the spectral shape of the sources.\nWe have conducted simulations to calculate the efficiency\nof detection, W(\u0393, S): for a given number of sources with spec-\ntral parameters \u0393 and S, W(\u0393, S) gives us the fraction of simu-\nlated objects that were detected, i.e., their spectra fulfilled the\nquality filters that we applied to our data, see Sect. 3). and with\nbest fit spectral parameters being the same as the input (sim-\nulated) ones. This function can be used to correct observed\nsource properties, for example the dependence of \u3008\u0393\u3009 with the\nX-ray flux, from all the effects listed above. We defined a grid\nof points in \u0393-S covering the range of values measured for our\nobjects (\u0393 from 0.5 to 3; S from 10\u221216 to 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121).\nWe have simulated the same number of spectra on each grid\npoint. For these simulations we have used the list of detected\nsources before applying the quality filters, i.e., 2145 sources\nhave been simulated for each point in the \u0393-S grid. The input\nparameters of each simulated spectrum were the exposure time,\nresponse matrices and Galactic absorption of each real source,\nand the values of \u0393 and S at each grid point. We used model A\n(see Sect. 4.1) to simulate all the spectra, therefore absorption\nis not included in the simulations. Once all the spectra were\nsimulated, we applied the same quality filters that we used for\nour real data. Our source detection efficiency, at each grid point,\nwas defined as\nW(\u0393, S) = Ndet(\u0393, S) + Ndet (\u0393\n\u2032, S\u2032)\nNsim\nwhere Nsim is the number of sources that were simulated at the\ngrid point (\u0393, S) (this number is the same for all the grid points).\n872 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra of medium sources\nFig. A.1. Dependence of the detection efficiency of sources as a func-\ntion of \u0393 at different flux levels, obtained from simulations. Some val-\nues of the efficiency function can be above 100% because the fitted\nparameters may differ from the input ones (see text for details).\nIt is important to notice that, there are two possible contribu-\ntions to the final number of sources that will appear at a given\ngrid point (\u0393, S):\n1. The number of simulated sources at the grid point (\u0393, S)\nthat, after fitting, remain at the same grid point, Ndet(\u0393, S).\n2. The number of sources simulated at different grid\npoints (\u0393\u2032, S \u2032) that were detected, and with best fit spec-\ntral parameters (\u0393, S), Ndet (\u0393\u2032, S \u2032).\nThe values of the detection efficiency as a function of \u0393 are\nplotted in Fig. A.1 for different fluxes. We observe that, at\nfluxes below \u223c10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, the efficiency of detection\ndecreases significantly from \u0393 = 0.5 to \u0393 = 2, and then, starts\nto increase up to \u0393 = 3. The rise of efficiency at high values\nof \u0393 could be due to the sharp increase in the effective areas\nof the EPIC detectors at low energies combined with the in-\ncrease in the relative contribution to the total counts at these\nenergies for the steeper spectral slopes. It is interesting to no-\ntice that, although we have shown that the detection efficiency\nincreases for \u0393 values above 2.5, we have not detected these\nsuper-soft sources in our sample, hence, they must be rare. The\nreason why the efficiency function is higher for objects with\nhard (\u0393 \u223c 0.5) spectral slopes (notice that the effective area of\nthe X-ray detectors drops rapidly at energies below \u223c1 keV) is\nthat a source with a flat spectral slope has to be much brighter\nthan one with a soft (\u0393 \u223c 2) spectral slope in order to have the\nsame 0.5\u20132 keV flux. Therefore we will receive more counts in\nthe 0.2\u201312 keV band from flatter objects, which means that it\nwill better detect them and more easily pass our spectral quality\nfilters.\nOur simulations showed that there are movements of ob-\njects in the \u0393-S plane, i.e., the fitted parameters may differ from\nthe input ones. It is necessary to study how important this effect\nis and whether there are systematic shifts (for example a ten-\ndency to detect the sources with lower values of gamma at faint\nfluxes). Hence, we have calculated for each grid point the av-\nerage values of \u0393 and S, in the same way as we did for the real\nsample, from all the sources simulated at that point that were\ndetected (no matter at which grid point they were detected).\nFig. A.2. Representation of the average movements in the \u0393-S plane\nobtained from simulations. The beginning point of each arrow indi-\ncates the input values of \u0393 and S in the simulations; the end points are\nthe observed (fitted) average values of \u0393 and S for the detected sources.\nThe results, shown in Fig. A.2, confirm the existence of shifts\nin the \u0393-S plane at the faintest fluxes: on average, the measured\n\u0393 values tend to be softer, and hence the observed 0.5\u20132 keV\nfluxes are lower. However, for fluxes \u226510\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 these\nmovements are not significant and tend to soften than harden\nspectra.\nReferences\nAkiyama, M., Ohta, K., Yamada, T., et al. 2000, AJ, 532, 700\nAkiyama, M., Ueda, Y., Ohta, K., et al. 2003, ApJS, 148, 275\nAlmaini, O., Shanks, T., Boyle, B.
