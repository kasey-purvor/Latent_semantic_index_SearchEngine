Artificial periodic irregularities (API) are pro-\nduced in the ionospheric plasma by a powerful standing\nelectromagnetic wave reflected off the F region. The re-\nsulting electron-density irregularities can scatter other\nhigh-frequency waves if the Bragg scattering condition is\nmet. Such measurements have been performed at mid-\nlatitudes for two decades and have been developed into\na useful ionospheric diagnostic technique. We report here\nthe first measurements from a high-latitude station, using\nthe EISCAT heating facility near Troms\u00f8, Norway. Both\nF-region and lower-altitude ionospheric echoes have been\nobtained, but the bulk of the data has been in the E and\nD regions with echoes extending down to 52-km altitude.\nExamples of API are shown, mainly from the D region,\ntogether with simultaneous VHF incoherent-scatter-radar\n(ISR) data. Vertical velocities derived from the rate of\nphase change during the irregularity decay are shown and\ncompared with velocities derived from the ISR. Some of\nthe API-derived velocities in the 75\u2014115-km height range\nappear consistent with vertical neutral winds as shown by\ntheir magnitudes and by evidence of gravity waves, while\nother data in the 50\u201470-km range show an unrealistically\nlarge bias. For a comparison with ISR data it has proved\ndifficult to get good quality data sets overlapping in height\nand time. The initial comparisons show some agreement,\nbut discrepancies of several metres per second do not yet\nallow us to conclude that the two techniques are measur-\ning the same quantity. The irregularity decay time-con-\nstants between about 53 and 70 km are compared with the\nresults of an advanced ion-chemistry model, and height\nprofiles of recorded signal power are compared with\nmodel estimates in the same altitude range. The calculated\namplitude shows good agreement with the data in that the\nmaximum occurs at about the same height as that of the\nmeasured amplitude. The calculated time-constant agrees\nvery well with the data below 60 km but is larger above\n60 km by a factor of up to 2 at 64 km. The comparisons\nCorrespondence to: M. T. Rietveld\nwith the model are considered to be a good basis for more\nrefined comparisons.\n1 Introduction\nA high-frequency (HF) radio wave which reflects off the\nF-region plasma sets up a standing-wave pattern which\nmay extend to quite low altitudes. If the field strength of\nthe wave is strong enough, it may change the electron\ndensity at the interference maxima by one of several differ-\nent mechanisms depending on the altitude. Above about\n130 km the ponderomotive force of the HF wave, which is\nproportional to the gradient of the time-averaged square\nmagnitude of the electric field, can redistribute the elec-\ntron density directly. Near the point of reflection of an\nO-mode wave, Langmuir waves are produced whose pon-\nderomotive force can drive the artificial periodic irregular-\nities (API) because the ponderomotive force of the\nLangmuir waves is much stronger than that of the HF\nwaves.\nBelow about 120 km the Ohmic heating of electrons\nresults in electron-density changes because of the depend-\nence of the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and the recom-\nbination rate on the electron temperature, \u201e\ne\n, and below\nabout 70 km because the electron attachment rate to\nmolecules depends on \u201e\ne\n. The resulting layers of API are\nable to influence HF waves by the mechanism of Bragg\nscatter, leading to a practical and powerful technique of\ndiagnosing the ionospheric plasma which does not depend\non total reflection like the conventional ionosonde tech-\nnique. The discovery and application of this technique\nwas made by Russian scientists in the 1970s, but there has\nbeen little work done in western facilities until recently. So\nfar all the work has been performed at mid-latitude\nstations.\nIn Sect. 2 we first review previous experimental and\ntheoretical work on API formation and decay, since much\nof this work is not generally known in western countries.\nWe then present the experimental arrangement in Sect. 3\nand the first results of F-region API echoes from auroral\nlatitudes in Sect. 4. The remainder of the paper presents E-\nand D-region results from Troms\u00f8, giving details of the\ntechnique, ionospheric conditions and typical examples.\nOne of our aims is to validate the ionospheric parameters\ndeduced from the API technique by means of comparison\nwith simultaneous incoherent-scatter-radar (ISR) data.\nVertical neutral winds are deduced from the API experi-\nment and an initial comparison is made with vertical\nwinds measured by the ISR technique. From the limited\namount of velocity data compared, although there is some\ngeneral agreement, we cannot conclude that the two tech-\nniques are measuring the same quantity.\nIt may seem surprising to readers, as it initially was to\nsome of the authors, that the HF-standing-wave pattern is\nstrong enough to affect the electron density at altitudes as\nlow as 52 km where, as will be shown later, API echoes\ncan occur. This point is discussed near the end of Sect. 5.\nTime-constants of API decay in the altitude region\n52\u201470 km are compared in Sect. 6 to the results of the\ntime-dependent Sodankyla\u00a8 ion chemistry (SIC) model,\nand are found to be in excellent agreement at altitudes\nbelow 60 km, and reasonable agreement (within a factor of\ntwo) at higher altitudes. The recorded API signal power at\nthe moment of heater switch off, as function of altitude, is\nalso compared with model estimates. The forms of the\naltitude profiles of the power are similar, with both the\nmodelled and measured power maximising near 60 km.\n2 Previous work\nIn 1975 it was discovered by Belikovich et al. (1975) that\nwhen an intense short-wave radio signal with ordinary\n(O-) mode reflected off the F region, weak (90\u2014100 dB\nweaker) backscatter could be observed simultaneously\nsomewhat lower down using a higher-frequency extraord-\ninary- (X-) mode wave. This experiment mode is what we\nwill refer to as the two-frequency experiment. The mecha-\nnism of formation of these F-region irregularities was in\nterms of the ponderomotive force as discussed in several\npapers (e.g. Belikovich et al., 1977, 1978a; Varshavskii,\n1978). Tolmacheva (1980) extended the theory to include\nthe effect of the geomagnetic field. The time-constants for\nformation and decay of these echoes as well as of superim-\nposed oscillations were tens of milliseconds and the\ndensity variation DN\/N was deduced to be 10~6. By\nmeasuring the period of API oscillation, the ion-acoustic\nfrequency, and hence the electron and ion temperatures,\ncould be estimated (Belikovich et al., 1977). Fejer et al.\n(1984) measured F-region API at the low-latitude Arecibo\nheating facility, and found the ratio of scattered to reflec-\nted power to be 10~4, or about 40 dB greater than that\nmeasured by Belikovich et al. (1977), concluding that\nanomalous absorption must have been present in the\nRussian experiments.\nEchoes from API in the E region (120\u2014170 km) were\nalso observed by Belikovich et al. (1978a), and electron\nthermal diffusion was identified as being the dominant\nmechanism of API at altitudes below about 110 km. The\nuse of API backscatter to measure electron density pro-\nfiles above the E layer was proposed by Belikovich et al.\n(1978b) and experimental results were obtained by\nBelikovich et al. (1979) showing the inter-layer valley.\nFurther results were given by Belikovich et al. (1986),\nTerina (1986, 1996), who showed the application of the\ntechnique to study the D region. Belikovich et al. (1995)\npresented further results and also discussed the accuracy\nof the measurements. Belikovich and Mareev (1987) exam-\nined the effect of finite pulse length and density gradient\non the scattered probe signal. Belikovich et al. (1993)\ncompared electron densities derived by the API technique\nwith those derived from the partial reflection technique\nand found good agreement.\nThe first detection of API from the lower D region was\nmade by Belikovich et al. (1981) using the SURA heater in\nRussia with a frequency of 5.75 MHz and an effective\nradiated power (ERP) of 20 MW. Scattering from irregu-\nlarities was observed from 55\u201470 km with characteristic\ntime-constants of 0.1\u20141 s. The formation of API in the\nlower D region was explained by Belikovich and Razin\n(1986), with the interpretation of measurements of the\ndecay times of API in the lower D region from about 55 to\n70 km being given by Belikovich and Benediktov (1986a).\nThe measured time-constants could be explained by\nelectron attachment to O\n2\n. They deduced the negative\nion-electron density ratio for different seasons based on\na simplified ion-chemistry model. Belikovich and Be-\nnediktov (1986b) concluded that temperature variations\ncaused by gravity-wave propagation cause fluctuations in\nthe measured decay times and Belikovich and Benediktov\n(1986c) explained amplitude and decay-rate variations\naround sunset and sunrise as being caused by the change\nin atomic-oxygen concentration. Vertical motions in the\nionospheric D and E regions were deduced by Belikovich\net al. (1991) from the rate of change of phase of the\nBragg-scattered API signals as they decayed and were\nthereby able to measure wave-like motions. A recent sum-\nmary of the Russian D-region studies using API is given\nby Belikovich and Goncharov (1995).\nTheoretical works have looked at various aspects of\ninterpreting echoes from API to diagnose the ionosphere.\nFor the F-region horizontal stratification, Fejer (1983)\npredicted a large decrease in group delay for weak diag-\nnostic waves just below the frequency of the powerful\nmodifying wave and an increase in delay for frequencies\nabove the modifier, which could be a new diagnostic\ntechnique for detecting the degree of density change. So\nfar this idea seems not to have been tested. Lapin and\nTamoikin (1984) showed that the curvature of the periodic\nstructure affects the probe-wave scattering only slightly if\nthe distance between the height of the probe-wave scatter-\ning and pump reflection height is small compared with\ntheir distance from the receiver. These authors also con-\ncluded, in what appears to be work closely related to that\nof Fejer (1983), that the effect of a periodic lattice on the\nwave reflected from the F region can lead to attenuation.\nLapin (1994) looked at the combined effects of ambipolar\ndiffusion and turbulence on the relaxation time of the\nscattered waves from the E and D regions. As might be\n1438 M. T. Rietveld et al.: Artificial periodic irregularities in the auroral ionosphere\nexpected, the amplitude of the scattering decreases in the\npresence of turbulence. Gershman and Ryzhov (1983)\nconsidered the effect of only turbulent mixing on the decay\nof API in the 70\u201490-km height range and give an expres-\nsion for the relaxation time in terms of the mean-square\nvelocity of turbulent motion and the scale of inhomogene-\nity. Grigor\u2019ev et al. (1990) showed that for typical gravity\nwaves the characteristic relaxation time of the scattered\nsignal is reduced to 1\u201410 s instead of the much longer\ntimes characteristic of ambipolar diffusion in the E region.\nRecently Belikovich et al. (1994) suggested a method\nwhereby the vertical profile of neutral temperature could\nbe derived from profiles of API relaxation time in the\n100\u2014120-km height region.\n3 Experimental arrangement at Troms\u00f8\nIn the F region the ponderomotive force causes electron-\ndensity depletion on a short time-scale of milliseconds.\nThis means that to detect them one has to probe the\nirregularities during their formation, which means while\nthe powerful pump or heating wave is on. Without going\nto a bistatic arrangement, where the receiver is not ad-\nversely affected by the direct ground wave from the pump,\nit is not possible to probe the irregularities using a wave\nwith the same frequency as the pump. The alternative is\nthat the probing wave must be of another frequency and\npolarisation such that the pump does not adversely affect\nthe probe-wave receiver but the wavelengths of the pro-\nbing and pump waves are equal. The required resonance\ncondition for this two-frequency arrangement, which is\nn\n1\nf\n1\n\"n\n2\nf\n2\n, where n is the refractive index and f the\nfrequency and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the heating\nand probing waves, respectively, is met over a relatively\nnarrow height range of a few km. When f\n1\ndoes not equal\nf\n2\n, this condition may still be met for opposite polarisa-\ntions.\nIn the lower ionosphere, where thermal and chemical\nrates cause the electron density to change on a much\nlonger time-scale of usually at least hundreds of milli-\nseconds, one can use the same frequency as the pump\nwave to probe the irregularities, but only after the pump\nhas switched off. In this way one can detect the API decay\nusing typical pulse repetition frequencies of 50\u2014200 Hz.\nWith this single-frequency arrangement the resonance\ncondition is met at all altitudes.\nFigure 1 shows schematically the formation of the\ndensity irregularities in the standing-wave pattern applied\nto the situation in Troms\u00f8. The EISCAT heating facility\n(Rietveld et al., 1993) is used to transmit both the pump\nwave and probing waves. Since the facility consists of 12\ntransmitters each connected to its own antenna, it is\npossible to select a subset of transmitters or two groups of\ntransmitters having different frequencies for the pumping\nand probing waves. The full power of the facility is not\nnecessary for the success of the API experiments and so\nreduced power is often used. Selecting fewer than 12\ntransmitters means that the radiated beam width increases\nin the north-south plane beyond the normal half-power\nfull width of 15\u00b0 of the lowest-frequency array (Array 2).\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram illustrating the single-frequency API ex-\nperimental arrangement at Troms\u00f8. In this arrangement Bragg\nscattering is in principle possible throughout the whole height region\nup to the F layer if the irregularities are formed and have a long\nenough decay time to be probed after the pump has been switched\noff\nThe wider beam width has the disadvantage that off-\nvertical echoes from natural irregularities will be stronger\nand the API echoes weaker. The API echoes are thought\nto occur only from the first Fresnel zone overhead.\nThe receiver for the probing wave is the dynasonde\n(Wright et al., 1990), an advanced digital HF sounder.\nReceiving antennas are 22-m-long dipoles which have\na gain of about 3 dB and are normally used during stan-\ndard ionospheric sounding with the dynasonde. The dyn-\nasonde is operated in a fixed-frequency sounding mode\n(P-mode) which was designed for partial-reflection work.\nIn this mode 30-ls pulses are transmitted and a 60-kHz\nwide filter is used in the receiver to give 4.5-km height\nresolution from the time of flight. Only in some of the\nearly experiments was a 60-ls pulse used with a 30-kHz\nfilter. The dynasonde transmitter is disconnected and the\nappropriate Heater transmitters are connected instead\nthrough a special switching arrangement. For the API\nexperiments performed to date the two receiver channels\nwere usually connected to two orthogonal, spaced an-\ntennas instead of multiplexing each receiver between three\nspaced antennas on subsequent pulses as in normal\nM. T. Rietveld et al.: Artificial periodic irregularities in the auroral ionosphere 1439\nFig. 2. Grey-scale plot showing the power backscattered by\na 4.9128-MHz probing wave with 60-ls pulses while the Heating\ntransmitter was transmitting a 5.423-MHz, X-mode wave of 5-s\nduration every 15 s. The vertical resolution is 9 km, determined by\nthe 60 ls pulse length and the 30-kHz receiving bandwidth. The\ndark band above 240 km is the saturated echo from the F layer\nsounding. All complex amplitudes in a chosen height\nrange were sampled with 12 bits every 10 ls and recorded\non disk. Subsequent analysis enabled the circularly\npolarised components to be reconstructed.\nThe ISR data we will use for comparison with the API\ndata were obtained with the GEN-11 experiment, also\nknown as CP-6, on the VHF (224-MHz) radar (Turunen,\nT., 1986). This 13-bit Barker-coded experiment yields\nauto-correlation functions of the plasma at 1.05-km range\nintervals every 10 s from 70- to 113-km range. These are\nthen integrated and analysed to give electron density,\nDoppler velocity and spectral width. We are only con-\ncerned with electron-density and velocity results here.\n4 F-region echoes\nIn February 1993 the first experiments were made at\nTroms\u00f8 to determine the feasibility of detecting Bragg\nscatter off API in the F region using the two-frequency\narrangement. The pump wave was on for 5 s every 15 s at\n5.423 MHz in the X-mode using 4 transmitters each at\n60 kW giving an ERP of about 30 MW, while the probe\nwas at 4.9128 MHz in the O-mode also from 4 transmit-\nters at 60 kW each. The probing pulse was 60 ls long in\nthese early experiments and repeated typically every\n20 ms. These attempts immediately proved successful, as\nthe range-time-intensity plot in Fig. 2 shows. For this\ninitial experiment the receiving antenna used was in fact\nthe Troms\u00f8 University partial-reflection experiment\n(PRE) antenna array designed for 2.75 MHz. It was felt\nthat this would be more sensitive than the standard long\ndipoles normally used by the dynasonde, and that this\nextra sensitivity would be necessary, although subsequent\nexperiments showed that even simple dipole antennas work\nwell. In the Russian experiments a partial-reflection facility\nwas used for the API probing (Belikovich et al., 1995).\nFor the experiment in Fig. 2, the data from 4 pulses\n(80 ms) were collected followed by a gap of 7 pulses\n(140 ms). Because the resulting periodic time resolution of\nthe data was only 0.22 s, we cannot resolve the temporal\nvariation of the echoes very well. Nevertheless, one can see\nin the first two heater pulses a broadening of the reso-\nnance region in the first few seconds. This may be indica-\ntive of the formation of irregularities in the F region and\nso this technique could prove to be of value when com-\nbined with other measurements of the heated region.\nWhen Fejer et al. (1984) performed a similar experiment at\nArecibo, they found that the ratio of the scattered API\npower to specularly reflected power \u2018\u2018was about 10~4,\nconsiderably higher than the value of about 2.5]10~9\nmentioned by Belikovich et al. (1977)\u2019\u2019. In our data the\nreflected wave was saturated most of the time, so it is\ndifficult to compare with the scattered signal. Neverthe-\nless, one can see from Fig. 2 that there is some fading of\nthe specular echoes which causes the echo to dip below\nsaturation. The strongest API echo, which is during the\nsecond heater pulse, is only about 6 dB below the\nsaturated F-layer echo. Assuming a fading depth of the\nF-layer echo to be about 30 dB, one can estimate that the\nstrongest API echo during the second heater pulse is\nabout 36 dB below the specular reflection, which is in\nrough agreement with the estimate of Fejer et al. (1984).\nWhether this is typical or not we do not know, but future\nexperiments will measure the relative amplitude more\ncarefully.\n1440 M. T. Rietveld et al.: Artificial periodic irregularities in the auroral ionosphere\nThere was another intriguing effect seen in API echoes\njust below the F layer during the early single-frequency\nexperiments which deserves closer examination. There\nwas a region of backscatter extending 10 km or more\nbelow the specular reflection height immediately after\nheater switch-off and which decayed, apparently moving\nupwards to the specular reflection level within about\n100 ms. Perhaps this was an electron-density stratification\nin the Airy pattern of the standing HF wave which\ndecayed. The large extent of more than 10 km below the\nreflection height may have been only an apparent one if\nthe reduction in group delay for frequencies just slightly\noff the pump frequency really occurs as predicted by Fejer\n(1983). Although the probing wave was at the same fre-\nquency as the pump wave, the 60-ls pulse length ensures\nthat there is significant energy within a several-kHz band-\nwidth. We intend to verify this phenomena in the near\nfuture. Apart from these preliminary F-region observa-\ntions, however, we have concentrated on the experiments\nin the lower ionosphere. The reason is that although with\nthe EISCAT facilities one has generally a very good in-\nstrument to measure F-region parameters at nearly all\ntimes, the lower D region can be diagnosed only under\nspecial conditions even with such powerful ISR systems.\n5 D and E-region echoes\n5.1 October\u2014November 1993 measurements\nIn October 1993, the first successful single-frequency ex-\nperiment for the lower ionosphere was made at Troms\u00f8.\nSince then we have repeated the experiments at irregular\nintervals. We present below some characteristics of the\nechoes, but so far we have not performed any statistical or\nsystematic seasonal studies. In November 1993 we attem-\npted to compare API results with those from incoherent-\nscatter observations of the D region on two days. For\nboth pump and diagnostic pulses we used all 12 transmit-\nters at 90 kW each giving 300 MW of ERP. The pump was\nswitched on for either 4 or 26 s (this alternated every\n5 min) followed by 4 s of 30-ls diagnostic pulses every\n10 ms.\nDuring the first attempt on 16 November 1993 there\nwere strong signals in the VHF-ISR data due to electron\nprecipitation, but as a result the D-region absorption\nappeared to be too high for the API experiment to\nwork at 4.04 MHz, at least using X-mode for the\npump and diagnostic waves, which we invariably did in\nthe early attempts. In fact ionograms made before and\nafter the API experiment showed a lack of X-mode trace\nbut a clear O-mode trace. In retrospect, changing to\nO-mode operation may have resulted in successful API\ngeneration.\nThe second attempt on 18 November 1993 resulted in\nexcellent API echoes, but the signal-to-noise ratio of D-\nregion signals in the ISR data below 80 km was very low.\nFigure 3 shows a combined grey-scale and surface plot of\nsome of the API echoes, again obtained with 4.04-MHz\nX-mode waves. One can see a clear decay of echo\nstrength with time between 77 and 120 km with varying\ntime-constant. At 94 km there appears to be a sharp\nminimum in irregularity production. Below this the time-\nconstant is either much longer than the 4 s of sampling\nwhich we used, or the irregularity decay is superimposed\non a pre-existing natural irregularity which varies little\nover the 4 s sampled. We have analysed a half-hour inter-\nval of such data to obtain the amplitude, time-constant\nand rate of change of phase of the decaying API irregulari-\nties. Figure 4 shows a series of amplitude and phase\nvariations (dots) for the data in Fig. 3 together with fitted\n(solid lines) functions. In the left column an exponential\nfunction plus constant baseline is fitted to the amplitude,\nwhile in the right column a linear fit was made to the\nphase. The time-constant of the exponential fit and appar-\nent velocity from the linear rate of change of phase are\nindicated in each fit. We show only every fourth height\nsampled because there is considerable overlap between\ngates due to oversampling. The phase fit was made only\nusing those points in the time-series where the amplitude\nhad decreased to 1\/e of its initial value for two reasons: to\nminimise the effect of noise on the fit, and to fit only those\npoints where the API echoes dominate over other echoes\nfrom spatially distributed inhomogeneities. The reduced\nchi-square values were calculated assuming random\nGaussian noise. The standard deviations of the random\nfluctuations in the data were calculated from the point-to-\npoint data differences. The data points were equally\nweighted for all these fits: other forms of weighting were\ntried but made very little difference.\nSome of the exponential fits in Fig. 4. (90\u2014102 km) show\nsystematic deviations from the data beyond random noise,\nwhich are undoubtedly indications of partial reflections\nfrom underlying natural irregularities. In particular, the high\nvalues of chi-square for both amplitude and phase at\n96 km means that the assumed curves do not represent\nthe data well and so the error bars for those fits are meaning-\nless. These other echoes off natural irregularities could well\nbe off-vertical, since the transmitting beam transmits powerful\nwaves suitable for a partial-reflection experiment out to at\nleast 12\u00b0 off-vertical in the main beam, and the receiving\nantennas used here were simple dipoles with little directiv-\nity. The API echoes, on the other hand, are thought to\ncome from the first Fresnel zone overhead. Experi-\nmentally, the direction of arrival of the echoes should be\nmeasurable with a suitable configuration of the dynasonde\nreceiving array, and this is planned for the future. Further\ndiscussion on the effects of interfering echoes is given later.\nFigure 5 shows a vector plot of the velocities derived in\nthis way for the whole half-hour interval. Positive velocity\nmeans away from the radar. Acceptance of fits was deter-\nmined by a good linear fit to the phase, as determined by\na value of reduced chi-square near one. Attempts to pro-\nduce similar plots of vertical velocity from the VHF-radar\ndata were unsuccessful and resulted mainly in plots of\nnoise. In order to extract velocities from the VHF-radar\ndata during the ionospheric conditions during this par-\nticular experiment, one would need integration times of\nthe order of tens of minutes, where any fast wave motions\nwould not be detected. In the API velocity plot, however,\nthere are clear structures in the velocity field, indicating\nsome wave activity.\nM. T.

There are clearly coherent regions of both upwards\nand downwards velocity evident. The distance between vectors cor-\nresponds to 10 m s~1\nwave activity. To show that the variation in velocity\nreally is due to wave activity, a FFT was performed\non the time-series of velocities at a particular height. For\nheights in the range from about 80 to 95 km there was\ngenerally a decrease in power from 0 to 0.005 Hz followed\nby a constant power level for higher frequencies. The\ncut-off at 0.005 Hz could correspond to the gravity-wave\nspectrum cut-off at a Brunt-Va\u00a8isa\u00a8la\u00a8 period of about\n3.5 min.\nThe three asterisks in Fig. 6 are the averaged velocities\nobtained from the VHF-ISR experiment run simulta-\nneously. Only data from successful fits to measured inco-\nherent-scatter spectra are shown. The error bars of the\nISR data are also based on a least-squares fit of a complex\nexponential function to the measured complex autocor-\nrelation functions. Effectively this means that the spectral\nshape is assumed to be Lorentzian, and the velocity is\nderived from the overall Doppler shift. Examples of other\nmeasurements of vertical velocities (including errors) us-\ning the same modulation but using the EISCAT UHF\n(933-MHz) incoherent-scatter radar are given by Hansen\nand Hoppe (1996). Also shown at the right is the average\nelectron density profile (raw density) from the VHF-radar\n1444 M. T. Rietveld et al.: Artificial periodic irregularities in the auroral ionosphere\ndata. The signal-to-noise ratio of the ISR data was too\npoor to enable good velocity estimates to be made with\nthe intrinsic 1.05-km height resolution. The autocorrela-\ntion functions from three gates were therefore averaged in\nheight and integrated for 5 min to produce these data, but\nthe error bars are still very large. The agreement between\nthe two data sets is not so good in magnitude but the sign\nof the velocities agrees (positive velocity means upwards).\nIt is difficult to reach any firm conclusion on the reliability\nof derived vertical-wind motions from the API technique\nbased on this comparison. Nevertheless, it does emphasise\nthe complementary conditions necessary for the two tech-\nniques to produce data. Velocities can be derived with\nexcellent time resolution (tens of seconds) and good height\nresolution (about 5 km) at times when ISR measurements\nare of little use.\nThe correctness of the sign of the velocities derived\nfrom the API measurements was verified independently\nby comparing the velocities derived from echoes off\na sporadic-E layer which was descending steadily between\nabout 1000 and 1030 UT during the experiment. This\nlayer was seen by both the dynasonde\/heater radar as well\nas the ISR. The velocity derived from the rate of phase\nchange was consistently negative (downwards) and of the\ncorrect order of magnitude as the average rate of descent\n(about 2 m s~1) of the layer as obtained from the time-of-\nflight measurements.\n5.2. Sources of error in velocity determination\nThe velocity we derive from the rate of change of phase\nhas a contribution from the different decay rates of the\nirregularities as a function of height within the volume\ncontributing to the Bragg-scattered signal. One can look\nat this as a shift in the effective height or centre of gravity\nof the scattering volume as the height of main contribu-\ntion to the scattering changes. To estimate quantitatively\nthis effect we have used the measured amplitudes and\ntime-constants to model the irregularity decay and calcu-\nlate the scattered signal on the ground as a sum of indi-\nvidual phasors from each plane in the Bragg-scattering\nlattice. The results are not plotted here, but it is sufficient\nto note that the maximum contribution to the velocity\nfrom this effect is about 0.1 m s~1 for the data of 15\nSeptember 1994, now shown.\n5.3. September 1994 measurements\nFurther simultaneous VHF-ISR and API measurements\nwere made on 15 September 1994. Ten transmitters of\n80 kW each, giving an ERP of about 200 MW, were used\nfor the API experiment. Because we had observed rather\nlong decay times in several previous experiments, and\nbetter to determine the natural background echo vari-\nation, we used a longer 16-s interval of probing after a 4-s\npump. On this occasion no API echoes were obtained at\nfirst using an X-mode pump and probe waves. Suspecting\nthat absorption was too high, we changed at 1216 UT to\nO-mode for both the 4.04-MHz pump and probe waves,\nwhich resulted in good API echoes. These echoes ex-\ntended below the 67-km lower sampling boundary which\nwe were using, so we decreased the starting height and\nobtained echoes from about 52 km upwards, as is shown\nin the combined surface and grey-scale plot in Fig. 7. The\nAPI signals are clearly much weaker than those in Fig. 3.\nTwo main regions of decaying echoes are seen above 96\nand below 72 km, respectively, with a narrow region of\nwhat are probably partial reflections from natural irregu-\nlarities between 86 and 95 km. Partial reflections are com-\nmonly seen at these heights and the reader is referred to\nEvans (1974), Dieminger and Schlegel (1976) and refer-\nences therein for a more extensive description of these\nechoes and the technique.\nFigure 8 shows the amplitude and phase fits to these\ndata for the first 4 s of each time-series. In general the fits\nare very good and repeatable between heater pump pulses\nwhich were 20 s apart. Although the linear fits to the phase\nare very good, the resulting vertical velocities show a bias\nof about !4 m s~1 over the whole profile, which is diffi-\ncult to explain as a neutral wind. Looking at the sub-\nsequent fits (Fig. 10), we see the bias may be smaller but is\nstill negative over the whole range. We have no explana-\ntion for this bias.\nThe signal-to-noise ratio of the ISR signals, which had\ngenerally been low since the beginning of the experiment\nat 1100 UT, suddenly increased between about 1220 and\n1250 UT as some electron precipitation occurred. Figure\n9 shows for the interval 1220\u20141230 UT mean profiles of\nthe API amplitude, time-constant and derived vertical\nvelocity, together with bars showing their standard devi-\nation. The standard deviation is not to be regarded as an\nerror bar associated with a typical measurement but\na measure of the actual variation of the quantity involved.\nThe asterisks show the vertical velocities from the VHF\nradar, this time with the intrinsic 1.05-km resolution. The\nerror bars of the VHF velocities are very small in compari-\nson to the 18 November 1993 data: they are of the order of\nthe size of the asterisk. Again illustrating the comp-\nlementarity of the conditions required for the two experi-\nments, API signals were weak and the resulting data were\nsparse. Nevertheless, there are enough values for a reaso-\nnable comparison over the limited height range from\nabout 72 to 97 km. The velocities from the two techniques\nagree with each other to within a metre per second at\nsome heights but differ by several metres per second at\nothers. A difference of a few metres per second is large for\nvertical velocities. In this comparison we believe that the\nISR velocity data are reliable because of the rather good\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and that the API-derived velocities\nabove 75 km may be in error, since the amplitudes of the\nAPI echoes were weak and perhaps influenced by partial-\nreflection echoes.\nThe solid line in the right-most panel of Fig. 9 shows\nthe raw electron density profile from the VHF-radar for\nthis interval. The VHF-radar data stop abruptly at the\nlower height limit of 70 km because of limitations in the\nstarting range of the experiment. The only easy way to get\ndata from lower altitudes is to tilt the antenna to the\nnorth. The antenna was tilted to 67\u00b0 elevation at 1235 UT,\nallowing measurements down to about 65-km altitude.\nM. T. Rietveld et al.: Artificial periodic irregularities in the auroral ionosphere 1445\nFig. 7. Grey-scale and surface plots of\nAPI echoes extending down to 52 km\non 15 September 1994. The surface\nplot shows linear amplitude. The\npump and probing HF waves were\n4.04 MHz and O-mode during these\nmeasurements. The pump had been on\nfor 4 s prior to the 0-s tick. The weaker\nechoes between 85 and 95 km are\nthought to be natural partial\nreflections\nThe dashed line shows the corresponding density profile\nfor the interval 1240 to 1250 UT, showing that conditions\nwere stable. The tilted antenna meant, however, that the\nvelocity measurements now contained a large horizontal\ncomponent of the wind which made direct comparisons\nwith API-derived vertical winds impossible. Such hori-\nzontal velocities may be of interest in future, more detailed\nstudies of the possible effect of wind shear-induced turbu-\nlence on API echoes.\nThere is a sporadic-E layer visible in the electron den-\nsity profiles at 102.5-km altitude. This was also observable\nin the API data, but was not included in the analysis of the\nAPI decays. Such a layer should be of use in calibrating\nthe height determination of the API data. The strong\nsaturated echoes of the HF wave from this layer, together\nwith the fading and variability, were such that the echo\nappeared very broad, so that accurate determinations\nwere difficult with this precision. Other independent calib-\nrations confirm that the dynasonde-derived heights pre-\nsented here are correct to within about a kilometre.\nAfter about 1300 UT the electron densities decreased,\nexcept for a brief 3-min burst of relativistic electron\n1446 M.

This brief\nevent was also seen by a nearby imaging riometer as\na localised patch of absorption. Excellent API signals\nwere obtained from 1314 UT onwards (there were no\nAPI data taken during the relativistic precipitation\nburst) with API signals covering the region 57\u201477 km, as\nwe have seen. In Fig. 10 we show the individual ampli-\ntudes, time-constants and velocities derived during the\ninterval 1326\u20141332 UT, with the bars showing the errors\nof the fitted values assuming Gaussian noise. The time-\nconstant shows relatively little variation, while the velo-\ncity shows more variation and the amplitude shows the\nmost, as one might expect, since the amplitude is depen-\ndent on so many propagation conditions. The time-con-\nstant might be expected to remain largely a property of\nthe ionospheric composition (see Sect. 6) and could be\nfairly constant over 6 min, while the velocity may be\nexpected to be more sensitive to wave activity in the\nneutral wind.\n5.4. Strength of echoes and conditions\nBelikovich and Benediktov (1986a) report the amplitude\nof the D\/E region API echoes to be 50\u201480 dB below that\nof specular reflection. In our experiments we have not\nmeasured this carefully, since, in the cases where we have\nF-region specular reflection, the echoes saturated the re-\nceiver. We have examples of API echoes at 100 km being\nabout 20 dB below the saturated F-region echo. Generally\nwe can say that the echo strength is comparable to that of\nnatural partial reflections.\nWe briefly discuss the question: Is it reasonable to\nexpect detectable irregularities to be produced by the\nHF-standing-wave pattern at such low altitudes ? Even if\nthere are no other losses, the range squared losses of the\nHF wave reflecting from about 200 km imply that the\nstanding-wave ripple is no more than about 5% in power.\nAssume an electron density at 70 km of 1]108 m~3 and\nthat the effect of the direct heater wave is to cause a\ndoubling of electron temperature at 70 km. The model\n1448 M. T. Rietveld et al.: Artificial periodic irregularities in the auroral ionosphere\nFig. 10. Profiles of amplitude, decay time-constant and vertical veloc-\nity over a 6-min interval on 15 September 1994. The bars show the\nindividual errors of the parameters of the 18 measurements within\nthis time-interval. The thick lines show the modelled amplitude and\ntime-constant from the Sodankyla\u00a8 ion-chemistry model. The fourth\npanel shows the electron density (solid line), positive-ion density\n(dotted line) and negative-ion density (dashed line) used in the model\ncalculations in Sect. 6 show that this heating effect can\ncause a 12% decrease in electron density of which only\n5% is modulated by the standing wave, which means that\nthe amplitude of the density modulation is 6]105 m~3.\nThis causes a change in the refractive index (Dn) at 4 MHz\nof 2]10~6. Gardner and Pawsey (1953) argue that it\nwould suffice to explain 70 km partial reflection echoes\n(with a typical reflection coefficient of 10~5) if there were\nan abrupt change of refractive index of only 2]10~5\nextending over the sky. An approximately equal echo\nwould be caused by a discontinuity which extended not\nover the whole sky, but over a substantial fraction of\na Fresnel zone (about 3 km in diameter). The API echoes\nare comparable in strength with partial reflections, as we\nhave seen. So the refractive index change which causes the\nAPI is about 1\/10 of that necessary to explain partial\nreflections. There are, however, tens of such layers half\na wave-length apart so as to reflect coherently (Bragg\nscatter), so that it may be reasonable to expect a total\nreflectivity about the same as that for partial reflections.\nThere are several uncertainties involved here. The reflec-\nted wave may be weaker through absorption, but the\ntemperature and resulting density change may well be\ngreater than assumed here. The electron density may be\nan order of magnitude higher as it was in the experiment\nfrom 15 September 1994, so that Dn would already be\n2]10~5. Another complicating factor is that the refrac-\ntive index perturbations are in layers about a quarter-\nwavelength thick rather than as the single abrupt layer\nassumed by Gardner and Pawsey (1953).\nIn most of the above experiments we used X-mode\nheating and probing so as to avoid the perturbations to\nthe F region known to occur with O-mode heating, such\nas the formation of electrostatic plasma waves leading to\nanomalous (non-Ohmic) heating, density striations and\nanomalous absorption of other HF waves (see Stubbe,\n1996, and references therein). X-mode also has the advant-\nage that one may still be able to form a standing-wave\npattern when ionospheric critical frequencies are so low\nthat f\no\nF\n2\nis below the lowest usable heater frequency of\n4 MHz, whereas f\nx\nF\n2\ncan be above the heater frequency.\nThere were times when no API echoes were seen, presum-\nably due to too much absorption of the HF wave. In some\nof these cases the mode was then changed to O-mode,\nsince Ohmic absorption is less for O than for X-mode. In\nmany of these cases we suddenly saw API echoes, indeed\nM. T. Rietveld et al.: Artificial periodic irregularities in the auroral ionosphere 1449\nthe first time we tried O-mode on 15 September 1994 we\nsaw echoes at the extremely low altitudes of 55 km, as\nshown in Fig. 7.\n5.5 Effects of interfering echoes\nIn the intensity plot in Fig. 7, API echoes can be seen\ndecaying above and below another relatively constant\necho covering the height range 86\u201493 km. This slowly\nvarying echo is probably a partial reflection which is not\nunusual at these altitudes. In some cases the API and the\nnatural echoes are so close that interference between them\noccurs, making the deduction of time-constant and phase\nderivative difficult. Either analysis of API signals for de-\ntermination of ionospheric parameters must be restricted\nto cases where the API-signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently\nlarge, as has been done by previous workers (Belikovich\nand Benediktov, 1986a), or advanced signal subtraction\ntechniques must be used to subtract the natural echoes.\nThe latter approach may be impractical since the time-\nconstant for the natural echo variation appears to be sim-\nilar to that for the API.\nWhen natural partial reflections are present, it is often\npossible to derive an apparent velocity from the rate of\nchange of phase, which is often constant. Such velocities\nmay, however, include non-vertical components, since the\nreflections may be off localised scattering regions within\nthe heater-illuminated beam, which is 15\u00b0 wide in the\neast-west direction or even larger in the north-south direc-\ntion when not all transmitters are used. Care needs to be\ntaken, therefore, in separating natural and artificially in-\nduced echoes when attempting to deduce vertical vel-\nocities.\nWe have the impression that API echoes do not appear\nin those height regions, usually below 95 km, where there\nare partial reflections present. This may be because the\nturbulent motions associated with the partial reflections\nprevent the weak horizontal electron-density stratification\nfrom forming to a significant extent. On the other hand,\nAPI echoes are sometimes observed with non-blanketing\nsporadic-E layers appearing within the API-echo region,\nusually at heights above about 100 km.\n6 Interpretation of decay times below 70 km\n6.1. Time-dependent solution of a detailed\nion-chemistry model\nIn the lower F region and E region, thermal effects are\ndominant and changes in the ambipolar diffusion coeffic-\nient (D ) govern the formation and decay of the irregulari-\nties. In the lower D region, however, the time-constant for\ndiffusion, q\nd\n, given by (k2D)~1, where k is the wave num-\nber, becomes large. For example, at 70 km, q\nd\n\"140 s for\n25-m spatial scales (Belikovich and Goncharov, 1995).\nAnother possible irregularity production mechanism at\nthese heights is electron recombination, which also has\na time-constant which is comparably long, given by\n(2a\n%&&\nN)~1, where N is the electron density and a\n%&&\nis the\neffective recombination rate which is electron-temper-\nature dependent. Because of dynamic changes in the iono-\nsphere it seems unlikely that the standing-wave pattern is\nstationary enough over such long time-scales to produce\nperiodic irregularities by either of these two mechanisms.\nThere is, however, a mechanism which does have a short\nenough time-constant (0.1\u20141 s) to produce API at heights\nof the lower D region, and that is electron attachment to\noxygen molecules (Tomko et al., 1980). Thus the API\ntechnique should be useful for investigations of the nega-\ntive ion chemistry.\nWe use a model scheme to answer the following ques-\ntion: What is the exact chemical response of the iono-\nsphere at D-region altitudes in a typical API experiment,\nwhere heating is on for 4 s and off for 16 s ? The electron\ntemperature can increase through HF heating by about an\norder of magnitude in the D region on time-scales from\n10 ls at 60 km to about 1 ms at 90 km (Tomko et al., 1980;\nStubbe, 1996). For simplicity, let us first assume that the\nelectron temperature is doubled in the time-scale of mil-\nliseconds or less when heating is switched on. Since the\nchemical response times are known to be much slower, we\nmay simply calculate the time behaviour in a detailed\nion-chemistry model, during one API experiment cycle, by\nstudying what happens to the equilibrium ion concentra-\ntions when electron temperature is suddenly doubled for\n4 s and then suddenly halved back to the normal value for\n16 s. In actual calculations we use a representative altitude\nprofile of electron-temperature increase due to the heat-\ning. Electron temperature is assumed to be doubled at the\naltitude of 70 km. At lower altitudes, a cubic spline\ninterpolation is used so as to give an increase in\nelectron temperature by a factor of 1.2 at the altitude of\n50 km.\nWe use a detailed D-region ion-chemistry model with\n55 ion components, of which 36 are positive and 19 are\nnegative. This model, the Sodankyla\u00a8 ion-chemistry (SIC)\nmodel, was developed as an alternative approach to those\nD-region ion-chemistry models, which combine the more\ndoubtful chemical reactions to effective parameters whose\nvalues are set against experimental data. The original\nversion of the program included a detailed chemical\nscheme, in a conceptually simple model, for equilibrium\ncalculations in the altitude range from 70 to 100 km [see\ne.g. Burns et al., (1991); Turunen et al. (1995) also includes\nsome background information on the model and its ap-\nplications]. In the present version of the model, the selec-\ntion of ions is extended to include more positive cluster\nions, a selection of simple negative cluster ions and also\nchlorine ions (for a list of ions, see Turunen et al., 1995), so\nthat the model is aimed to be representative for the alti-\ntude range from 55 to 100 km in daylight conditions. Since\nthe altitude coverage of the API data, relevant to this\ncomparison, is from 52 to 77 km, we use the same choice\nof ions in the model calculations down to 50 km, although\nimportant, higher-order negative cluster ions are known\nto exist at lower altitudes. Now we introduce time depend-\nence into the model by solving the continuity equation in\nthe form\nLN\/Lt\"C(N)N#Q(N), (1)\n1450 M. T. Rietveld et al.: Artificial periodic irregularities in the auroral ionosphere\nwhere N is a vector of unknown ion concentrations,\nC a matrix of production and loss rates due to the mutual\nreactions between ions and Q is a vector of production rates\nin primary ionisation processes and in some specific reac-\ntion types. Equilibrium may be solved from Eq. 1 by setting\nLN\/Lt\"0, and using, e.g., the Newton-Raphson method\n(for details see Turunen et al., 1995). Starting from the\nequilibrium solution of the ion concentrations, we advance\nthe concentrations in time, by taking small time-steps ac-\ncording to an implicit differencing method (see Press et al.,\n1989, p. 631). For each time-step, a set of linear equations\nhas to be solved. The neutral atmosphere is taken from the\nMSIS-90 model. Those minor constituents which are not\ncovered by MSIS-90 are taken from Shimazaki (1985). The\nprimary ionisation is considered to be caused by cosmic\nrays and solar illumination only. The right-hand panel in\nFig. 10 shows the model electron, positive-ion and nega-\ntive-ion densities. The model electron density at 70 km is\n1.4]109 m~3 which is in reasonable agreement with the\nISR measured density shown in Fig. 9.\nAs a result of the model calculation we have the time\nbehaviour of each ion concentration during the API cycle.\nThe positive ions are seen to be unaffected by the API\nheating cycle. The concentration of negative ions responds\nrapidly to the heating, so that over 4 s a decrease of 12% in\nelectron density is observed in the example case at the\naltitude of 70 km. When heating is switched off the electron\nconcentration relaxes to the equilibrium value, with a char-\nacteristic time which can be compared with the measured\nAPI signal relaxation times. The most important negative\nions, which are responsible for the rapid electron-concen-\ntration changes, appear to be O~\n2\n, CO~\n3\nand CO~\n4\n.\nThe thick solid lines in Fig. 10 are the resulting ampli-\ntude and decay time-constant calculated from the model.\nThe amplitude, which is calculated in arbitrary units and\nis simply proportional to the calculated heater-induced\nelectron-density change, shows good agreement with the\ndata, in that it has a maximum at about the same altitude\nas that of the measured amplitudes. The time-constant\nalso shows reasonable agreement with the data overall.\nThe agreement is excellent below below 60 km, but above\nthat the experimental data tends to be lower than the\nmodel values by up to a factor of two.\nTime-constants in the height range 50\u201470 km were also\nderived by Belikovich et al. (1981), Belikovich and Benedik-\ntov (1986a) (their Figs. 1\u20145), Belikovich and Benediktov\n(1986b) (their Fig. 2) and Terina (1996). These authors also\nfound that above 65 km, the observed time-constants were\nlower than expected from a simplified scheme of negative\nion chemistry. They suggested that this could be explained\nby turbulence-induced decay of the API. The experimental\nvalues they obtained for the summer months are similar to\nour September values, whereas their winter results show\nvalues lower by about a factor of 2. We shall examine the\nseasonal variation and compare them with the mid-latitude\nresults after we have collected a larger data base.\n7 Conclusions and future work\nAfter reviewing previous work from other latitudes\nwe have shown the first echoes from artificial periodic ir-\nregularities produced in the auroral ionosphere by\na powerful HF wave reflected off the F layer. Both F-\nregion and lower ionospheric echoes down to about\n52 km were obtained using simple dipole receiving an-\ntennas. The D-region echoes have been analysed to obtain\ntime-constants of their decay and vertical velocities.\nSimultaneous ISR measurements of the electron density\nand vertical velocity were made by the 224-MHz EISCAT\nradar so that the latter could be compared with velocities\nderived from the API technique. The optimum geophysi-\ncal conditions for the two techniques seem to be com-\nplementary, such that the ISR gives best results when\nthere is electron precipitation and the HF absorption is\nhigher, whereas the API technique works best when there\nis lower absorption. As a result, although there is some\nagreement between the data sets, we do not have simulta-\nneous good-quality data sets and cannot show that both\ntechniques measure the same quantity, namely vertical\nneutral wind. Time-series of API-derived velocities from\n18 November 1993 do show signatures of vertical winds, in\nthat the magnitudes are reasonable, the average value is\nnear zero, and there are signs of gravity-wave fluctuations.\nVelocity data from a 5-min time-interval and 50\u201470-km\nheight interval on 15 September 1994, however, show a bias\nof several metres per second, which is difficult to reconcile\nwith vertical winds. Obviously more work is needed in the\narea of data selection and analysis and theory of API\nformation, in order reliably to derive vertical winds.\nThe parameter obtained from the API measurements\nin the lower D region which one would expect to vary least\nis the decay time-constant. A completely independent\ncalculation of the predicted time-constant obtained from\na complex ion-chemistry model of the lower D region\nshows reasonable agreement with the measurements. This\nindicates that we have a good basis for making more\nrefined comparisons between this model and experimental\nAPI measurements as well as ISR measurements.\nWe have shown the feasibility of making API measure-\nments in the high-latitude ionosphere and that it can be\ndone with relative ease. Future experiments at Troms\u00f8 will\nbe made to examine F-region API echoes during heating\nexperiments in more detail, to determine the structuring of\nelectron density just below the reflection height.\nBetter measurements of the backscatter cross-section\nshould be made for API echoes from all heights and\ncompared with theoretical estimates to see if we really\nunderstand the formation process. The spaced antennas of\nthe dynasonde should be used to get direction information\nin order to learn more about the nature of API echoes and\nperhaps to help separate D-region API from off-vertical,\npartial-reflection echoes. Further API data should be ob-\ntained from the D and E regions, to get a larger data base,\nso that seasonal and other effects on the lower ionospheric\nchemistry and dynamics can be examined. Such data\nshould be obtained simultaneously with further ISR data,\nto provide a better comparison of the derived ionospheric\nparameters. A search should be made for causal factors to\nexplain the absence of API echoes in certain height re-\ngions. For example neutral turbulence caused by horizon-\ntal velocity shears, which may inhibit the creation of the\nscattering layers, could be inferred from the radars.\nM. T. Rietveld et al.: Artificial periodic irregularities in the auroral ionosphere 1451\nA proper partial-reflection experiment should be per-\nformed at the same time as the API experiment to provide\nfurther information on D-region electron densities, since\nthe partial-reflection technique is far more sensitive than\nthe ISR technique at these heights. This knowledge should\nbe combined with a self-consistent calculation of the heat-\ning effect, which would provide a more accurate input to\nthe ion-chemistry model than that used here.\nAcknowledgements.
