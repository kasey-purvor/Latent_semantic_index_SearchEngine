Walker1, \u2217 and F.R. Xu2\n1Department of Physics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH, United Kingdom\n2Department of Technical Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China\n(Dated: March 17, 2006)\nEnergy-surface calculations for nuclides in the neutron-rich 19074W116 region show consistently that\nthe collective rotation of a deformed oblate shape is an energetically favoured mode, especially for\nangular momenta I > 12h\u00af. By comparing the calculations with existing experimental data, it is\nconcluded that the reported t1\/2 \u223c 1 ms isomer in\n190W may be an oblate shape isomer.\nThe small number of oblate-shaped nuclei found in na-\nture, compared with the many prolate nuclei, is a sur-\nprising feature of nuclear structure, which seems to be\nrelated to the strength of the nuclear spin-orbit interac-\ntion [1]. Furthermore, with increasing angular momen-\ntum, the collective rotation of an oblate shape, about an\naxis perpendicular to its axis of symmetry, is disadvan-\ntaged relative to prolate rotation, on account of the mass\ndistribution leading to a larger moment of inertia for the\nlatter. Therefore, the prediction that there would be \u201cgi-\nant backbending\u201d in the well deformed nuclide 180Hf at\nI \u2248 26h\u00af, made by Hilton and Mang in 1979 [2], was re-\nmarkable. They performed HFB calculations to show\nthat collective oblate rotation, incorporating rotation-\naligned nucleons, could take place at a lower energy than\nprolate rotation. The transition from one shape to the\nother would represent a striking and sudden structural\nchange, quite unlike anything yet observed. Neverthe-\nless, despite experimental and theoretical advances [3\u20135],\nexperimental evidence for the oblate mode in the mass-\n180 region has been inconclusive. For example, it has not\nproved possible to reach high enough angular momentum\nin 180Hf [6], though some evidence for oblate rotation has\nbeen found in 175Hf at I \u2248 40h\u00af [5]. However, it has been\nshown, on the basis of Total Routhian Surface (TRS) cal-\nculations [3], that the angular momentum at which oblate\nrotation becomes favoured decreases with increasing neu-\ntron number. Therefore, more detailed investigation of\nneutron-rich nuclei may give the best chance of finding\nthe oblate rotational mode in this mass region. Indeed, it\ncan be argued [3] that this region is optimal on account\nof reinforcing proton and neutron shell structures, with\nboth Fermi levels being high (but not too high) in their\nrespective shells. While a similar effect occurs for neu-\ntrons in the mass-130 region [7], with associated oblate\nstates, the protons then favour prolate shapes at high\nangular momentum. The competing proton and neutron\ncontributions lead to triaxiality, which itself has interest-\ning consequences [8, 9].\nIn the present work, we investigate the neutron-rich\nmass-190 region theoretically, with particular attention\nto 190W, where a t1\/2 \u223c 1 ms isomer was found in a\n\u2217Electronic address: p.walker@surrey.ac.uk\nprojectile-fragmentation experiment [10]. Rather than\nthe then proposed prolate, high-K interpretation (where\nK is the angular momentum projection on the symmetry\naxis) we now argue that the isomer may be an oblate,\n(i13\/2)\n2 rotational-aligned state. This lays the founda-\ntion for the \u201cgiant backbending\u201d predicted by Hilton and\nMang [2].\nTRS calculations have been performed for even-even\nnuclides in the mass-190 region, including 186\u2212190Yb,\n188\u2212192Hf, 186\u2212196W, 190\u2212200Os and 192\u2212200Pt. The\nsingle-particle energies are obtained from the deformed\nWoods-Saxon potential [11], with the Lipkin-Nogami\n(LN) treatment of pairing [12]. This avoids the spuri-\nous pairing phase transition encountered in the simpler\nBCS approach. The pairing stength, G, is determined\nfirstly by the average-gap method [13] and then adjusted\nby fitting experimental odd-even mass differences [14],\nwhich gives an enhancement of about 10% in the G val-\nues for both neutrons and protons. The increased pair-\ning strengths lead to consistent moments of inertia and\nmulti-quasiparticle energies [14, 15]. The total energy of\na configuration consists of a macroscopic part which is\nobtained from the stardard liquid-drop model [16] and a\nmicroscopic part resulting from the Strutinsky shell cor-\nrection [17], \u03b4Eshell = ELN \u2212 E\u02dcStrut. Calculations are\nperformed in the lattice of quadrupole (\u03b22, \u03b3) deforma-\ntions with hexadecapole (\u03b24) variation. For a given ro-\ntational frequency, pairing is treated self-consistently by\nsolving the cranked LN equation at any given point of\nthe deformation lattice and then the equilibrium defor-\nmation is determined by minimizing the obtained TRS\n(for details, see e.g. refs [18, 19]). Quadrupole pairing\nin doubly stretched coordinate space [20] has a negligi-\nble effect on energies, but is included because it has an\nimportant influence on collective angular momenta [19].\nThe results of the present calculations of ground-state\nshapes are broadly consistent with previous work [21, 22]\nwhere it has been noted that there is a predicted transi-\ntion from prolate to oblate shapes with increasing neu-\ntron number. However, the inclusion of the axially asym-\nmetric \u03b3 degree of freedom in the present work adds con-\nsiderable clarity to the nature of the shape transition.\nFor example, in the ytterbium isotopes, the TRS calcu-\nlations predict the ground-state shape change to occur\nbetween 186Yb116 (\u03b22 = 0.205, \u03b3 = \u22121\n\u25e6) and 188Yb118\n(\u03b22 = 0.188, \u03b3 = 60\n\u25e6) with clear prolate and oblate\n2X=\u03b22cos(\u03b3+30o)\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25\nY\n=\u03b2\n2s\nin\n(\u03b3+\n30\no\n)\n\u03b3=+30o\n0o\n-30o\n-60o\nFIG. 1: TRS plots in the \u03b22, \u03b3 plane for\n190W (upper panels)\nand 192Os (lower). Rotational frequencies are h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.20 MeV\n(left) and 0.22 MeV (right).\nminima, respectively. However, the corresponding shape\nchange is less distinct for osmium isotopes, and takes\nplace between N = 118 and 120. The calculated triaxial-\nity of the platinum isotopes is in accord with other work\n[23].\nHere we focus on the angular momentum degree of free-\ndom for the N = 116 isotones 188Hf, 190W and 192Os,\nwhich all have calculated prolate ground-state shapes.\nIn each case, at low rotational frequency, h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.22\nMeV, there is a sudden transition to oblate rotation as\nthe lowest-energy collective mode. This can be associ-\nated with the rotation alignment, at oblate shape, of\na pair of i13\/2 neutrons, contributing 12 units of an-\ngular momentum. It is the same process as has been\nproposed previously [2, 3], but now, at higher neutron\nnumber, the prolate\u2212oblate change occurs at lower an-\ngular momentum. Indeed, it seems to occur at the low-\nest possible angular momentum, 12h\u00af, for the full align-\nment of an i13\/2-neutron pair. Furthermore, with in-\ncreasing rotational frequency, the oblate shape remains\nenergetically favoured, as proton alignments contribute\nto neutron alignments in building the angular momen-\ntum. TRS plots, in the critical shape-changing region\nof rotational frequency, are shown in Figure 1 for 190W\nand 192Os. In both cases, the angular momentum jumps\nby 12h\u00af, I = 4 to 16, over a small rotational-frequency\ninterval, h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.20 to 0.22 MeV, due to the rotation\nalignment of an i13\/2-neutron pair. In\n190W the associ-\nated shape change is from prolate (\u03b3 = \u22123\u25e6) to oblate\n(\u03b3 = \u221262\u25e6), while in 192Os the shape change is from\ntriaxial (\u03b3 = \u221229\u25e6) to oblate (\u03b3 = \u221262\u25e6).\nThe 190W situation is now considered in the context\nof existing experimental data [10, 24]. The t1\/2 \u223c 1\nms isomer, which feeds into the ground-state rotational\nband at Ipi = (10+), was tentatively assigned a Kpi =\n10\u2212 2-quasiparticle Nilsson configuration, \u03bd11\/2+[615]\u2297\n\u03bd9\/2\u2212[514], based on the similar energies of known\nKpi = 10\u2212 isomers in 190,192Os [25], and supported,\nat least qualitatively, by multi-quasiparticle calculations\n[10]. However, as part of the present work, configuration-\nconstrained calculations [15] have been carried out to\ncompare the excitation energies in detail. Energies and\nshape parameters are given in Table I. It is now found\nthat, while the experimental 190,192OsKpi = 10\u2212 energies\nare well reproduced by the calculations, as illustrated in\nFigure 2, there is a significant discrepancy for the cor-\nresponding state in 190W. If, in fact, there is another\nisomer at lower energy, matching the theoretical predic-\ntion for 190W, then its non-observation experimentally\nwould not be surprising. Its lower energy would lead to a\nsignificantly longer lifetime, with loss of the time correla-\ntions that are needed for association of the \u03b3-ray events\nwith the arrival of 190W ions following fragmentation re-\nactions.\nTABLE I: Calculated Kpi = 10\u2212 energies and deformation\nparameters, including experimental energies for comparison.\nEexp (keV) Ecalc (keV) \u03b22 \u03b24 \u03b3\n\u25e6\n190Os 1705 1700 0.157 \u22120.053 \u22121\n192Os 2015 1920 0.147 \u22120.053 0\n190W 2360\u00b125 1633 0.162 \u22120.057 \u22121\nWe have searched in detail, through TRS and\nconfiguration-constrained calculations, for alternative\nconfigurations which might account for the observed iso-\nmer in 190W. The only reasonable solution is to identify\nthe bandhead of the oblate rotation-aligned structure as\nthe probable explanation. The energy is approximately\ncorrect, but in these calculations the energy of the band-\nhead itself is not well defined, due to the calculations\nbeing performed in a rotational-frequency basis, rather\nthan an angular-momentum basis. Extrapolation of the\ntheoretical spin-projected energies gives an estimate of\n2250 keV for the Ipi = 12+ state, with an uncertainty\nfrom the extrapolation of about 150 keV. This compares\nwell with the experimental isomer energy of 2360\u00b125 keV\n[10, 24]. Also, inspection of comparable rotation-aligned\n(i13\/2)\n2 structures known to exist in neighbouring nu-\nclides is valuable. Figure 3 shows data for N = 116 iso-\ntones, based the recent interpretation of Levon et al. [26]\nfor 194Pt and 196Hg. It is seen that the 12+ (i13\/2)\n2 iso-\nmers in 194Pt and 196Hg are at similar energies to the iso-\nmer in 190W.

Ex-\nperimental half-lives are indicated.\nis unknown experimentally, though it is notable that, in\naddition to the 6 s, Kpi = 10\u2212 isomer, a t1\/2 \u223c 200 ns\nisomer has also been identified, feeding into the ground-\nstate band at high spin [27]. From the calculations, an\noblate Ipi = 12+ isomer is expected at about 2100 keV\nin 192Os. This stable nuclide needs further experimental\ninvestigation.\nThe implications of Figure 3 are striking. We propose\nthat the observed t1\/2 \u223c 1 ms isomer in\n190W may be an\noblate rotation-aligned state, with its long half-life deriv-\ning from the substantial shape change required for its de-\ncay to the prolate ground-state band. The much shorter\n(few ns) half-lives of the comparable isomers in 194Pt and\n196Hg can then be due to the much less dramatic shape\nchanges involved, as their ground-state bands are weakly\ndeformed and triaxial (see also ref. [28]). Note that for\nlow-energy E2 decays in Z \u2248 80 nuclei, the strong varia-\ntion of the electron conversion coefficient with \u03b3-ray en-\nergy [25] leads to little dependence of half-life on transi-\ntion energy. Hence the large half-life difference between\nthe 194Pt and 190W isomers could not be ascribed solely\nto the energies of their E2 (12+ \u2192 10+) decays, which\nare uncertain in both cases.\nConfirmation of the oblate shapes requires additional\nexperimental data. The combination of quadrupole mo-\nments, g-factors, and transition-rate hindrance factors\n[29], should be able to give firm information for both\n190W and 192Os. The isomerism is a key feature in giving\naccess to these observables. Also, according to the cal-\nculations, the rotational bands above the oblate isomers\nshould be decoupled and have high rotational alignments,\ncontrasting with the strongly coupled bands associated\nwith the alternative prolate, high-K interpretation. The\n190W structure is a candidate for a classic case of \u201cgiant\nbackbending\u201d, of the type originally described by Hilton\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\ne\nn\ne\nrg\ny \n(ke\nV)\n190W\n0+\n12+\n~1ms  9ns 5ns\n192Os 194Pt 196Hg\nFIG. 3: Comparison of experimental isomer energies and half-\nlives for N = 116 isotones.\nand Mang [2].\nIn summary, the need to understand better the exci-\ntation energy and structure of an isomer in 190W has\nled to detailed energy-surface calculations and compar-\nisons with neighbouring nuclides. It is concluded that\nthe t1\/2 \u223c 1 ms isomer in\n190W could correspond to a\npredicted oblate shape isomer.\nWe thank the EPSRC, the Royal Society, and the\nNatural Science Foundation of China, under Grant Nos.\n10525520 and 10475002, for financial support.\n[1] N.
