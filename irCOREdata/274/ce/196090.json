Turner a Ian Postlethwaite a\naDepartment of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK.\nbUniversidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Bogota, Av Carrera 30 No. 45-03, Colombia\nAbstract\nThis paper develops an anti-windup scheme for systems with rate-limited actuators. The\nmain results show how a full-order anti-windup compensator can be synthesised using an\nalgebraic Riccati equation and several free parameters. A further result then shows how the\nfree parameters may be chosen to influence, in an intuitive way, the local L2 gain of the\nsystem and the size of the region of attraction. The results are of interest due to their low\ncomputational burden and hence their applicability to systems of large state dimension.\nKey words: Anti-windup compensation; Rate-saturation; Flight control.\n1 Introduction\nMuch of the constrained input literature addresses the problem of input saturation whereby\nthe magnitude of the control vector is subjected to element-wise constraints. Not surprisingly,\nresearchers have devoted much attention to this problem due to its prevalence in most engi-\nneering applications. The magnitude saturation problem led practitioners and researchers to\ndevelop compensators which could be retrofitted [10] to existing controllers to assist the orig-\ninal controller in maintaining stability and performance during periods of saturation. These\ncompensators have become known as \u201canti-windup\u201d (AW) compensators and many synthesis\ntechniques have been proposed (some of the notable examples are [18,42,14,20,9,30,7,21,17]).\nIt is evident that at present, at least in principle, the control engineer who faces magnitude sat-\nuration problems has tools to enable him\/her to address the problem, with some of the more\nmodern AW schemes guaranteeing stability and performance.\nMagnitude limits on the control vector are not the only class of input nonlinearity which may\nbe present in an otherwise linear system. Another significant class of nonlinearity which is\nwell known to cause problems is input rate saturation. Although there are various ways of\nmodeling this phenomenon, in essence, rate saturation (or rate-limiting as it is often called)\nlimits, normally in an element-wise fashion, the rate of change of the control vector. This\ntype of nonlinearity is not as wide-spread as the saturation nonlinearity, as, for example, elec-\ntrical systems typically are less prone to suffer from this problem. Nevertheless, rate-limited\nactuators can be a significant problem in many systems, particularly those with mechanical\nactuators, and in some applications rate-limiting can have devastating consequences. Some of\nthe more notorious examples of the catastrophic effects of rate-limiting are the crashes of the\nSAAB Grippen [1] and Boeing V22 Osprey aircraft [3], and the meltdown of the Chernobyl\nnuclear power plant [35].\nRecently, some attempts at applying anti-windup (AW) schemes to the rate saturation problem\nhave been made ([2,16,37,38]). Although the development of these schemes can be regarded\nas a step towards bridging the gap between the need to provide rigorous guarantees of the\nclosed-loop system\u2019s behaviour during rate-saturation, and the need to develop techniques\nwhich are useful in practice, these schemes have tended to be lacking in intuition and have\nnot been developed enough for the practising engineer. One of main advantages of using AW\nconditioning schemes is that the linear performance (i.e. the performance when rate-saturation\ndoes not occur) is not directly restricted by the conditioning method, giving full freedom in\nthe design of the linear controller. Moreover, the AW compensation schemes advocated in [44]\nwhich we follow here, are designed independently of the linear controller and thus the same\nAW compensator can be used with multiple controllers. This can be useful in some practical\nsystems where the linear controller may change, depending on operating condition.\nThe anti-windup technique developed for systems with rate-limits in this paper is based on\nthe framework introduced in [44] and the Riccati equation synthesis method proposed in [33].\nIn order to make the method of [33] applicable to rate-limited systems we use fairly standard\nresults on sector narrowing - see [22,15,45] for example - where the deadzone nonlinearity is\ndescribed locally by a sector of reduced size, leading to a tighter bound. By combining these\nvarious results, an AW design framework which is both rigorous and intuitive is developed. In\nparticular, the AW technique proposed contains several tuning variables which can be adjusted\nin a reasonably straightforward manner in order to trade-off features important in practical\nanti-windup problems. In fact, the results in this paper were developed with the aim of imple-\nmenting anti-windup compensators on a sophisticated experimental aircraft; these results are\nreported elsewhere [34,5,6].\nThe paper is organised as follows. In the next section a discussion of linear systems subject to\nrate-limited actuators will be given. Following this, the anti-windup problem for rate-limited\nactuators will be introduced and a method for solving this based on the Riccati-based technique\nof [33] will be proposed. A simulation example then follows and the paper ends with some\nconcluding remarks.\n1.1 Notation\nNotation is mainly standard throughout the paper. The notation H(s) \u2208 RH\u221e indicates that\nthe transfer function H(s) is real, rational and is analytic in the right-half-complex plane. We\n2\nmake extensive use of the saturation function defined as\nsatu\u00af(u) :=\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nsat1,u\u00af1(u1)\n...\nsatm,u\u00afm(um)\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb and sati,u\u00afi(ui) = sign(ui) min(|ui|, u\u00afi) (1)\nThe deadzone function is also frequently used and is defined as\nDz(u) := u\u2212 sat(u) (2)\nThe paper considers mainly local anti-windup compensation which requires consideration of a\nregion of attraction. For a nonlinear system x\u02d9 = f(x) with equilibrium point x = 0, the region\nof attraction is defined as\nA =\n{\nx \u2208 Rn : lim\nt\u2192\u221e\nx(t) = 0\n}\nThe L2 norm of a vector x(t) is defined as\n\u2016x\u20162 :=\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nx(t)\u2032x(t)dt\nand the induced L2 norm (or L2 gain) of a nonlinear operator, H as\n\u2016H\u2016i,2 := sup\n06=x\u2208L2\n\u2016Hx\u20162\n\u2016x\u20162\nLater in the paper, it is convenient to work with a local L2 gain which is defined as\n\u2016H\u2016i,2,W := sup\n06=x\u2208L2\u2229W\n\u2016Hx\u20162\n\u2016x\u20162\nwhere W is some subset of the input space of H. It is clear that \u2016H\u2016i,2,W \u2264 \u2016H\u2016i,2.\n2 Linear systems with rate-limited actuators\n2.1 System modeling\nThe paper is concerned with systems which take the form shown in Figure 1 which depicts\na closed-loop system which is linear except for the rate-limit nonlinearity. The stabilisable,\n3\nPSfrag replacements\nu urr\nyK(s) G(s)\nFig. 1. Linear system with rate-limited actuators\ndetectable finite-dimensional linear time invariant (FDLTI) plant has state-space realisation\nG(s) \u223c\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\nx\u02d9 = Ax + Bur\ny = Cx + Dur\n(3)\nwhere x \u2208 Rnp is the plant\u2019s state vector, y \u2208 Rq is the vector of measured outputs and\nur \u2208 Rm is the input to the plant. The controller K(s) is also FDLTI and produces a control\nsignal u \u2208 Rm from a reference input r \u2208 Rnr and the measured output y. Disturbances have\nnot been included, although are handled with little extra effort (see [44]). The input to the plant\nand the controller output are not necessarily identical due to the rate-limit nonlinearity, \u03a6(.) :\nR\nm 7\u2192 Rm, present at the plant input. This rate-limit nonlinearity represents the restrictions on\nthe rates of the actuator and is well known to complicate stability and performance analysis of\na system.\n_\nPSfrag replacements\nu\nur\nH\nd dm = x\u02d9r\nxr = ur\u222b\nFig. 2. Rate-limit model\nUnlike the position saturation nonlinearity, rate saturation is a dynamic nonlinearity and several\nmethods have been proposed to model it ([29,27,16,38]). Following [27] and others, in the\nwork here it is useful to model the rate-limit nonlinearity as shown in Figure 2. This model\nof the rate-limiter features a (decentralised) magnitude saturation in a feedback loop with a\nset of integrators and a (decentralised) set of gains H = diag(h1, . . . , hm). The rate-constraint\nvalues, which are now interpreted as magnitude saturation constraints in Figure 2, are defined\nas d\u00afi, i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . ,m}. The system\u2019s dynamic equations are as follows\n\u03a6r(u) \u223c\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\nx\u02d9r = sat(\u2212Hxr + Hu)\nur = xr\n(4)\nThis model of a rate-limit is appealing because, when the rate-limits have not been reached\n(i.e. when the saturation block in Figure 2 acts as the identity) the model behaves as a bank\nof low pass filters with cut-off frequency 1\/hi in each channel. However, when the rate-limits\nhave been reached, the rate-limit model can be interpreted as a restricted tracking problem:\nthat is the output ur attempts to follow u but with a restricted rate.\n4\nRemark 1: The time constants 1\nhi\nmust typically be greater than the dominant frequency com-\nponents of u in order to prevent the linear dynamics of the actuator from interfering too much\nwith the nominal control system design. This is often a valid practical assumption but if not,\nsome account of these linear dynamics must be taken during nominal linear controller design.\n\u0003\n2.2 Anti-windup architecture and the equivalent system\nH_\nPSfrag replacements\nu urr\ny\nK(s) G(s)\nd \u222bdm\nK\u02dc(s) G\u02dc(s)\nFig. 3. Equivalent magnitude limited system\nWhen the behaviour of the rate-limit nonlinearity is described by equation (4), the only nonlin-\nearity present in the system depicted in Figure 1, is the saturation nonlinearity internal to the\nrate-limit. By augmenting the plant and controller as shown in Figure 3, one can translate the\nrate-limit problem into an equivalent magnitude limit problem. In Figure 3, the \u201caugmented\u201d\ncontroller and \u201caugmented\u201d plant are respectively given by\nd = H[K1 K2 \u2212 Im]\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nK\u02dc\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nr\ny\nur\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb and y\u02dc :=\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 y\nur\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0G(s)1s\nI 1\ns\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nG\u02dc(s)\ndm (5)\nA state-space representation of G\u02dc(s) is easily derived as\nG\u02dc(s) =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0G(s)1s\nI 1\ns\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb \u223c\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nA B 0\n0 0 I\nC D 0\n0 I 0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n=\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 A\u02dc B\u02dc\nC\u02dc 0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb (6)\nThe augmented plant now includes dynamics absorbed from the rate-limit model and thus has\na larger state-vector [x\u2032, x\u2032r]\n\u2032 \u2208 Rnp+m; its poles are now those of the plant G(s) plus m poles at\nthe origin. The rate-limit problem can thus be thought of as a standard magnitude limit problem\nwith the new \u201cplant\u201d, G\u02dc driven by the signal dm and the new \u201ccontroller\u201d, K\u02dc, producing the\n\u201ccontrol\u201d signal d.\n5\nK(s) G(s)\n\u0398(s)=\nr\ny\n+ -\n+\n+\nyd\ndd\n-\n+ulin dm\nylin\n~\nd\nd\nM(s)-I\nG(s)M(s)\n~ ~\n~\n~\n~\n~\nFig. 4.

Equivalent representation of Figure 4\nThe above implies that rate-saturation problems can be treated in similar ways to magnitude\nlimited problems, and indeed similar AW architectures can be used. Figure 4 shows the archi-\ntecture used in this paper; the \u201caugmented\u201d plant, G\u02dc, and controller, K\u02dc, are those introduced\nearlier and the signal y\u02dc = [y\u2032 x\u2032r]\n\u2032 \u2208 Rq+m represents the \u201caugmented\u201d measurement from\nthe plant G\u02dc. The anti\u2013windup compensator, \u0398(s), is driven by the signal d\u02dc := d\u2212dm = Dz(d),\nwhich is a signal internal to the rate-limit. The outputs from the anti-windup compensator are\nlabeled dd \u2208 Rm and yd \u2208 Rq+m which are injected at the augmented controller\u2019s input and\noutput respectively. It is important to mention that this architecture could be difficult to realise\nfor physical rate-limits but as many systems contain software rate-limits to protect the physical\nrate-limits, it would be straightforward to apply to the software limits.\n3 Anti-windup compensation\nThe diagram in Figure 4 is somewhat difficult to interpret and, aside from using the AW com-\npensator \u0398(s) to guarantee the stability of the system, the remaining design goals are unclear.\nHowever, with the anti-windup compensator parameterised as\n\u0398(s) =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 M(s)\u2212 I\nG\u02dc(s)M(s)\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb , M(s) \u2208 RH\u221e (7)\n6\nit is possible to re-draw Figure 4 as Figure 5. In this diagram, the subscripts \u201clin\u201d denotes a\nsignal which is produced from a purely linear system and the subscript \u201cd\u201d denotes a signal\nproduced by a system driven by the deadzone function, \u201cdisturbing\u201d the linear behaviour. This\ntransformation was first proposed in [43,44] (see also [20,40]) and reveals an attractive de-\ncoupling of the system into: nominal (unsaturated) linear loop, nonlinear loop and disturbance\nfilter. Two interesting features are evident from the diagram.\ni) Assuming that the nominal (unsaturated) loop is stable, then provided G\u02dc(s)M(s) \u2208 RH\u221e,\nthe nonlinear stability problem reduces to that of guaranteeing stability of the nonlinear\nloop.\nii) The deviation of the system from nominal linear performance is quantified by the \u201csize\u201d of\nsignal y\u02dcd.\nFrom the above, it follows that the anti-windup problem can be defined in terms of the non-\nlinear operator Tp : dlin 7\u2192 yd [42,31], the \u201cgain\u201d of which dictates how much the linear\nperformance degrades in the presence of (rate) saturation.\n3.1 Problem set-up\nIn the magnitude limit case, G(s) \u2261 G\u02dc(s), and therefore, providing that G(s) \u2208 RH\u221e global\nstability can be established if global stability of the nonlinear loop can be established for\ncertain M(s); it has been proven (see for example [13,33]) that global quadratic stability is\npossible if and only if the nominal linear plant is bounded real, i.e. \u2016G(s)\u2016\u221e < \u03b3 for some\npossitive scalar \u03b3. The rate-limit case is not quite as simple; even if G(s) is stable, because\nG\u02dc(s) = [G(s)\u2032\/s I\/s], it follows that G\u02dc(s) \/\u2208 RH\u221e and therefore not bounded real. This\nimplies that we must seek local stability. Additionally, the only way to ensure that the so-\ncalled disturbance filter is stable is to introduce zeros in M(s) to \u201ccancel\u201d the unstable poles\nin G\u02dc(s). One convenient way to do this is to let M(s) be part of a coprime factorisation of\nG\u02dc(s) = N(s)M(s)\u22121. In this case, a state-space realisation for our anti-windup compensator\ncan be given as\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 M(s)\u2212 I\nG\u02dc(s)M(s)\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0M(s)\u2212 I\nN(s)\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb \u223c\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nA\u02dc + B\u02dcF B\u02dc\nF 0\nC\u02dc 0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb (8)\nwhere F is a matrix chosen to ensure A\u02dc+B\u02dcF is Hurwitz and is effectively the free parameter in\nour anti-windup synthesis routine. In this case a state-space realisation of Tp, which represents\nthe mapping from our linear \u201ccontrol signal\u201d, dlin, to the perturbation to the output, y\u02dcd, can be\n7\nwritten as\nTp \u223c\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u02d9\u02dcx = (A\u02dc + B\u02dcF )x\u02dc + B\u02dcd\u02dc\ndd = Fx\u02dc\ny\u02dcd = C\u02dcx\u02dc\nd\u02dc = Dz(dlin \u2212 dd)\n(9)\nHowever, this cancelling of the unstable poles of G(s), causes problems in ensuring that the\nnonlinear loop is globally stable. To circumvent this, we drop the stipulation of global stability\nand instead seek to ensure that the system is locally exponentially stable. This also makes\npractical sense, as in most control problems we are not interested in ensuring stability for all\npossible states; rather we seek stability for a set of states around an operating point. Thus\nformally we can pose the following problem:\nProblem 1: Rate-limit Anti-windup Compensation\nThe objective of the rate-limit anti-windup problem is to design a compensator of the form\ngiven in equation (8) such that\na) When dlin \u2261 0, the operator Tp is locally exponentially stable; that is limt\u2192\u221e x\u02dc(t) = 0 for\nall x\u02dc(t) \u2208 X \u2282 A.\nb) When x\u02dc(0) \u2261 0, \u2016Tp\u2016i,2,W \u2264 \u03b3 for some \u03b3 > 0 and some set W \u0003\nAs our AW compensator in equation (8) is a function of the state-feedback gain F , the above\nproblem essentially reduces to choosing F such that Tp is locally exponentially stable and\n\u2016Tp\u2016i,2,W \u2264 \u03b3. Note further that, by the structure of our AW compensator, if d \u2208 D \u2200t \u2265 0 \u2217 ,\nthen the AW compensator will remain inactive and linear performance will be not be disturbed.\nAlso, in essence the local exponential stability assumption ensures that if dist(dlin,D) \u2208 L2\nand dlin \u2208 W , then y\u02dcd \u2208 L2, ensuring an asymptotic return to linear behaviour if saturation\noccurs - see [40] or [24] for more details.\n3.2 Local anti-windup\nThe concept we make use of to enable local results to be derived is a long-standing tool in con-\nstrained input control, perhaps first being introduced in [15] and, since then, used frequently\nin the anti-windup literature ([45,31] for example).\nThe idea is as follows. It is well known that the deadzone nonlinearity Dz(d) \u2208 Sector[0, I]\n\u2217 The hyper-cuboid D = [\u2212d\u00af1, d\u00af1]\u00d7 [\u2212d\u00af2, d\u00af2]\u00d7 . . .\u00d7 [\u2212d\u00afm, d\u00afm] divides the space of the input signal\ninto linear unconstrained region (i.e. d \u2208 D) and a saturated region (i.e. d \/\u2208 D)\n8\nfor all d \u2208 Rm. Now assume that di \u2264 do,i for some d0,i for all i, and define\nS(d0) := {d \u2208 Rm : \u2212d0 \u0016 d \u0016 d0} (10)\nwhere d0,i > d\u00afi. If this is the case for all time t > 0, it is evident that Dz(d) \u2208 Sector[0,K]\nwhere K = diag(\u000f1, \u000f2, . . . , \u000fm) and \u000fi = (do,i \u2212 d\u00afi)\/do,i. It is possible to simplify this further\nby letting \u000f = maxi \u000fi, which implies that Dz(d) \u2208 Sector[0, \u000fI] for all d \u2208 S(d0).\nTherefore by restricting our attention to d \u2208 S(d0) where d0 < \u221e , which in turn implies\n\u000f \u2208 (0, 1), the deadzone is guaranteed to inhabit a narrower sector than Sector[0, I]; that is\nd \u2208 S(d0) \u21d2 Dz(d) \u2208 Sector[0, \u000fI] (11)\nNote that for any arbitrary large d0 there always exists an \u000f \u2208 (0, 1) such that Dz(d) \u2208\nSector[0, \u000fI] (in fact, global results are recovered if d0,i = \u221e \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . ,m}, and hence\nDz(d) \u2208 Sector[0, I]). Note that by assuming Dz(d) \u2208 Sector[0, \u000fI], we are effectively re-\nstricting our attention to only a subset of possible signals d and thus results derived on this\nbasis will be necessarily local, rather than global.\n3.3 Region of attraction\nAs we are interested in deriving local results, it is desirable to estimate the region in which our\nproposed anti-windup compensation technique provides local asymptotic stability. In other\nwords, when deriving an anti-windup compensator we also seek a region of attraction (ROA)\nto accompany it, with it preferably being as large as possible. In general, computation of the\nregion of attraction for nonlinear systems is a nontrivial task and over the years many authors\n([39,8,2,12,11,23,38]) have proposed methods which can be used to estimate the region of\nattraction for a saturated system.\nQuite frequently in saturated systems analysis, an exact description of the region of attraction\nis not required and here we are content to consider a region of attraction with a crude geometry.\nIn the saturated systems literature (as in [19], [12] for example), an ellipsoidal approximation\nis typically used,\nE =\n{\nx\u02dc \u2208 Rnp+m : x\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc < c\n}\n. (12)\nThe largest such ellipsoid can be estimated (see for example [36], [41]) using a simple formula\nwhich will be given later. The salient feature of this type of representation is that it will allow a\ntransparent relationship between AW design parameters and a subset of the region of attraction,\nE \u2282 X \u2282 A to be observed. It must be mentioned that the states of interest when characterising\nthe region of guaranteed stability are the states of our AW compensator x\u02dc, as stability of our\nlinear loop is guaranteed to be global.\n9\n3.4 Anti-windup solution\nThe objective of the anti-windup compensator proposed is to find a \u0398(s) such that\n\u2022 The map Tp : dlin 7\u2192 yd is sufficiently small.\n\u2022 The nonlinear loop is locally asymptotically stable\nWe have seen that finding such a \u0398(s) can be reduced to finding an appropriate coprime fac-\ntorisation G\u02dc(s) = N(s)M(s)\u22121, and that this, in turn, reduces to finding an appropriate state\nfeedback gain F . A systematic way of computing F , based on the Riccati equation approach\nreported in [33,31] is given in the Theorem below.\nTheorem 3.1 There exists a full order anti-windup compensator \u0398 = [\u0398\u20321 \u0398\u20322]\u2032 \u2208 R(q+2m)\u00d7m,\nas stated in (8), which solves Problem 1 if there exist matrices P = P \u2032 > 0, W = diag(w1, . . . , wm) >\n0, and positive real scalars \u03b3 and \u000f such that the following Riccati equation is satisfied\nA\u02dc\u2032P + PA\u02dc + PB\u02dc(\u03b3\u22122I \u2212 2 (1\u2212\u000f)W\u22121\n\u000f2\n)B\u02dc\u2032P + C\u02dc \u2032C\u02dc = 0 (13)\nwhere the matrix Z must satisfy the following inequality:\nZ = (2W \u2212 \u03b3\u22122(\u000fW )2) > 2\u000fW > 0 (14)\nFurthermore, if equation (13) is satisfied, a suitable \u0398 is obtained by calculating the matrix F\nas\nF = \u2212\n(\n(2\u2212 \u000f)W\u22121\n\u000f2\n\u2212 \u03b3\u22122I\n)\nB\u02dc\u2032P (15)\nA subset of the region of attraction is given by the ellipsoid\nE\u00af =\n{\nx\u02dc \u2208 Rnp+m : x\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc < cmax\n}\n(16)\nwhere\ncmax = min\ni\nd\u00af2i w\n2\ni\n(1\u2212 \u000f)2( (2\u2212\u000f)\n\u000f2\n\u2212 \u03b3\u22122w2i )B\u2032iPBi\n(17)\nand wi is the ith diagonal element of W and Bi is the ith column vector of B, for some i \u2208\n{1, . . . ,m}. \u0003\u0003\nProof: A similar Theorem was briefly introduced in [31], although a slightly different proof\nwill be provided here. It is constructed in several stages as detailed below.\ni) The main inequality Consider the function\n10\nL :=\nd\ndt\nx\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc + \u2016C\u02dcx\u02dc\u20162 \u2212 \u03b32\u2016dlin\u20162 + 2d\u02dc\u2032W (\u000fd\u2212 d\u02dc) < 0 (18)\nThe final term 2d\u02dc\u2032W (\u000fd \u2212 d\u02dc) arises from the assumption that d \u2208 S(d) \u2200t \u2265 0 and hence\nthat 2d\u02dc\u2032W (\u000fd\u2212 d\u02dc) \u2265 0. Now consider two cases\n(1) Assume that x\u02dc(0) = 0 and dlin \u2208 W where\nW := {dlin \u2208 Rm : d \u2208 S(d0)} (19)\nThis implies that d \u2208 S(d0) \u2200t \u2265 0 and thus if inequality (18) holds then this implies\nd\ndt\nx\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc + \u2016C\u02dcx\u02dc\u20162 \u2212 \u03b32\u2016dlin\u20162 < 0 (20)\nIntegration with respect to time from t = 0 to t = \u221e gives\nx\u02dc(\u221e)\u2032Px\u02dc(\u221e)\u2212 x\u02dc(0)\u2032Px\u02dc(0) + \u2016y\u02dcd\u201622 \u2212 \u03b32\u2016dlin\u201622 < 0 (21)\nwhich in turn implies that \u2016y\u02dcd\u20162 \u2212 \u03b3\u2016dlin\u20162 < 0 and hence that \u2016T \u2016i,2,W < \u03b3. i.e. Condi-\ntion b) of Problem 1 is satisfied.\n(2) Next assume that dlin = 0 \u2200 t \u2265 0 and that x\u02dc(0) \u2208 E where\nE =\n{\nx\u02dc \u2208 Rnp+m : x\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc \u2264 c\n}\n(22)\nfor some c > 0. Furthermore let c be sufficiently small to ensure that d \u2208 S(d0). Then it\nfollows that 2d\u02dc\u2032W (\u000fd\u2212 d\u02dc) \u2265 0 and inequality (18) implies that\nd\ndt\nx\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc = V\u02d9 (x\u02dc) < 0 (23)\nand thus V (x\u02dc) is a Lyapunov function for the nonlinear loop in Figure 5, which ensures\nlocal asymptotic stability for all x\u02dc(0) \u2208 E . Thus the system is locally asymptotically stable\nand hence, if inequality (18) holds, Condition a) of Problem 1 is satisfied.\nThus, it remains for us to prove that satisfaction of inequality (18) is equivalent to the\nexpressions given in the Theorem.\nii) Evaluation of the main inequality. The remainder of the proof shows how we can re-write\nthe cost function L, equation (18), as the conditions given in Theorem 3.1. Evaluating equa-\ntion (18) results in an inequality containing several cross terms in d\u02dc, dlin, and x\u02dc. Using\nsimilar ideas to those proposed in [32], it is possible to address this issue and avoid LMI\nformulations.\nExpanding (18) and substituting d = dlin \u2212 dd gives\nL = x\u02dc\u2032C\u02dc \u2032C\u02dcx\u02dc\u2212 \u03b32d\u2032lindlin + \u02d9\u02dcx\n\u2032\nPx\u02dc + x\u02dc\u2032P \u02d9\u02dcx + 2d\u02dc\u2032\u000fWdlin \u2212 2d\u02dc\u2032\u000fWdd \u2212 2d\u02dc\u2032Wd\u02dc (24)\nWe now group the cross-product terms in three steps:\n(I) Cross-product terms involving dlin and d\u02dc are grouped as follows:\n\u2212\n[\n\u03b32d\u2032lindlin \u2212 2d\u02dc\u2032\u000fWdlin\n]\n= \u2212\u2016(\u03b3dlin \u2212 \u03b3\u22121W\u000fd\u02dc)\u20162 + \u03b3\u22122d\u02dc\u2032\u000f2W 2d\u02dc (25)\n11\nCombining the above with (24), a cost function containing no cross-product terms between\ndlin and d\u02dc is obtained. Using equation (9) to expand \u02d9\u02dcx and noticing that dd = Fx\u02dc:\nL = x\u02dc\u2032(C\u02dc \u2032C\u02dc + A\u02dc\u2032P + PA\u02dc + 2F \u2032B\u02dc\u2032P )x\u02dc + 2x\u02dc\u2032(PB\u02dc \u2212 \u000fF \u2032W )d\u02dc\n\u2212d\u02dc\u2032Zd\u02dc\u2212 \u2016\u03b3dlin \u2212 \u03b3\u22121W\u000fd\u02dc\u20162 (26)\nwhere Z = 2W \u2212 \u03b3\u22122\u000f2W 2\n(II) Cross-Product terms involving d\u02dc and x\u02dc are grouped as follows:\n\u2212\n[\nd\u02dc\u2032Zd\u02dc\u2212 2x\u02dc\u2032(B\u02dc\u2032P \u2212 \u000fWF )\u2032d\u02dc\n]\n=\u2212\u2016(Z 12 d\u02dc\u2212 Z\u2212 12 (B\u02dc\u2032P \u2212 \u000fWF )x\u02dc)\u20162 +\nx\u02dc\u2032(B\u02dc\u2032P \u2212 \u000fWF )\u2032Z\u22121(B\u02dc\u2032P \u2212 \u000fWF )x\u02dc (27)\nNote that Z must be positive definite in order to have a well posed problem. This condition\narises from the necessity of making the quadratic term\n\u2212\u2016(Z 12 d\u02dc\u2212 Z\u2212 12 (B\u02dc\u2032P \u2212 \u000fWF )x\u02dc)\u20162\nnegative for any pair (d\u02dc, x\u02dc). It can easily be shown that if Z < 0, this is not always\nguaranteed. By replacing this new group of terms, a new cost function is obtained. This\ncost function has no cross-product terms between d\u02dc and x\u02dc.\nL \u2264 x\u02dc\u2032(C\u02dc \u2032C\u02dc + A\u02dc\u2032P + PA\u02dc + 2F \u2032B\u02dc\u2032P + PB\u02dcZ\u22121B\u02dc\u2032P \u2212 2F \u2032W\u000fZ\u22121B\u02dc\u2032P + F \u2032W\u000fZ\u22121\u000fWF )x\u02dc (28)\n(III) Terms involving F and F \u2032F are grouped:\nF \u2032W\u000fZ\u22121\u000fWF + 2PB\u02dc(I \u2212 Z\u22121\u000fW )F = \u2016Z\u2212 12 (\u000fWF + (Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)B\u02dc\u2032P )\u20162\n\u2212PB\u02dc(Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)\u2032Z\u22121(Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)B\u02dc\u2032P (29)\nThus it follows that our cost function (18) can be written as\nL = La + Lb + Lc (30)\nwhere\nLa=x\u02dc\n\u2032(C\u02dc \u2032C\u02dc + A\u02dc\u2032P + PA\u02dc + PB\u02dcZ\u22121B\u02dc\u2032P \u2212\nPB\u02dc(Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)\u2032Z\u22121(Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)B\u02dc\u2032P )x\u02dc (31)\nLb=\u2016Z\u2212 12 (\u000fWF + (Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)B\u02dc\u2032P )x\u02dc\u20162 (32)\nLc=\u2212\u2016Z 12 d\u02dc\u2212 Z\u2212 12 (B\u02dc\u2032P \u2212 \u000fWF )x\u02dc\u20162 \u2212 \u2016\u03b3dlin \u2212 \u03b3\u22121W\u000fd\u02dc\u20162 (33)\nEquation (30) comprises three terms; the last, Lc, is a negative definite quadratic term.\nTherefore if the first two terms can be set to zero, then L(.) < 0. Setting the second term,\nLb, and noting that Z > 0, yields:\n\u000fWF + (Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)B\u02dc\u2032P = 0 (34)\n12\nUsing the expression for Z (Z = 2W \u2212 \u03b3\u22122\u000f2W 2) yields the following condition for the\ngain matrix F :\nF = \u2212\n(\n(2\u2212 \u000f)W\u22121\n\u000f2\n\u2212 \u03b3\u22122\n)\nB\u02dc\u2032P (35)\nwhere P = P \u2032 > 0 comes from solving the Ricatti equation which makes La = 0:\nA\u02dc\u2032P + PA\u02dc + C \u2032C + PB\u02dcZ\u22121B\u02dc\u2032P \u2212 PB\u02dc(Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)\u2032Z\u22121(Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)B\u02dc\u2032P = 0 (36)\n\u21d4 A\u02dc\u2032P + PA\u02dc + C \u2032C + PB\u02dc[Z\u22121 \u2212 (Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)Z\u22121(Z\u000f\u22121W\u22121 \u2212 I)]B\u02dc\u2032P = 0 (37)\n\u21d4 A\u02dc\u2032P + PA\u02dc + C \u2032C + PB\u02dc[\u2212\u000f\u22122W\u22122Z + 2\u000f\u22121W\u22121]B\u02dc\u2032P = 0 (38)\nEquation (13) is then obtained by substituting Z = 2W \u2212 \u03b3\u22122\u000f2W 2 into equation (38).\niii) Calculation of the region of attraction. In part i) it was shown that the system is locally\nasymptotically stable in a set E \u2282 X where X is a subset of the region of attraction. As\nmentioned earlier, we estimate ellipsoidal subsets of the region of attraction and in particu-\nlar are interested in calculating the largest such ellipsoid, E\u00af which has the following form\nE\u00af =\n{\nx\u02dc \u2208 Rnp+m : x\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc < cmax\n}\n. (39)\nFor the estimation of the region of attraction it is assumed that dlin = 0 and, to ensure that\nthe deadzone is within a reduced sector, that the states x\u02dc belong to the set\nX =\n{\nx\u02dc \u2208 Rnp+m : d \u2208 S(d0) \u2200t \u2265 0\n}\n\u2282 A (40)\nThus to calculate an ellipsoidal region of attraction we seek the largest set such that\nx\u02dc \u2208 E\u00af \u21d2 d \u2208 S(d0) \u2200t \u2265 0 (41)\nor equivalently we seek the largest set\nE\u00af =\n{\nx\u02dc \u2208 Rnp+m : x\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc < cmax, |d| = |Fx\u02dc| \u0016 d0\n}\n(42)\nThus if x\u02dc \u2208 E\u00af it follows that d \u2208 S(d0) and Dz(d) \u2208 Sector[0, \u000fI]; hence the system is\nlocally stable. To calculate E\u00af , we follow a method used in, for example, [36], [41]. The\nlargest ellipsoid region of attraction can be posed a maximisation problem:\nmax\nx\u02dc\nx\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc s.t. |Fx\u02dc| \u0016 d0 (43)\nwhich is equivalent to\nmax\nx\u02dc\nx\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc s.t. |Fix\u02dc| < d0,i \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} (44)\nwhere, Fi is the ith row of F . The largest such ellipsoid can then be calculated using\ncmax = min\ni\nd20,i\nFiP\u22121F \u2032i\n(45)\n13\nSubstituting for F yields\ncmax =\nd\u00af2i w\n2\ni\n(1\u2212 \u000f)2( (2\u2212\u000f)\n\u000f2\n\u2212 \u03b3\u22122w2i )B\u2032iPBi\n(46)\nwhich completes the proof. \u0003\u0003\nRemark 2: It can be seen that as \u000f gets close to unity, the size of cmax, and hence the size of E\u00af\nincreases, for fixed \u03b3 and W . Thus by making \u000f arbitrarily close to unity, the size of the region\nof attraction can be made arbitrarily large for some appropriate choice of \u03b3 and W . \u0003\n3.5 Improved tuning procedure\nThe main issue in using Theorem 3.1 for anti-windup synthesis is that the Riccati equation\n(13) is not guaranteed to be solvable for arbitrary \u03b3, \u000f and W and hence the design could be\ncomplex. However, using equation (14), which imposes the inequality constraint Z > 0, it is\npossible re-write Theorem 3.1 in a manner where a solution to the Riccati equation (13) is\nalways guaranteed.\nCorollary 1 There exists a full order anti-windup compensator \u0398 = [\u0398\u20321 \u0398\u20322]\u2032 \u2208 R(q+2m)\u00d7m\nwhich solves strongly the anti-windup problem if there exists a matrix P = P \u2032 > 0, and\npositive real scalars \u000f \u2208 (0, 1), and \u03c1 > 0 such that the following Riccati equation is satisfied\nA\u02dc\u2032P + PA\u02dc\u2212 \u03c1PB\u02dcB\u02dc\u2032P + C\u02dc \u2032C\u02dc = 0 (47)\nFurthermore, if equation (47) is satisfied, a suitable \u0398 achieving \u2016T \u2016i,2,W < \u03b3 is obtained by\ncalculating the matrix gain F as follows:\nF = \u2212(1\u2212 \u000f)\u22121\u03c1B\u02dc\u2032P (48)\nwhere \u03b3 =\n\u221a\n1\n\u03c1\n. An estimate the region of attraction is given by the ellipsoid\nE\u00af = {x\u02dc : x\u02dc\u2032Px\u02dc \u2264 cmax} where cmax = max\ni\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\nd\u00af2i\n\u03c12B\u02dc\u2032iPB\u02dci\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8fe (49)\n\u0003\nProof: The proof will show how, by re-defining certain parameters, the expressions in Theorem\n3.1 can be re-written as those in Corollary 1. As before, \u03b3 and \u000f are assumed to be positive\nscalars, and W is chosen to be W = \u03c9I, \u03c9 > 0. First note that using inequality (14), we\n14\nobtain a bound on \u03b3\u22122 as\n\u03b3\u22122I < 2\n(1\u2212 \u000f)\n\u000f2\nW\u22121 \u21d2 \u2203k \u2208 (0, 2) s.t. \u03b3\u22122 = k (1\u2212 \u000f)\n\u000f2\n\u03c9\u22121 (50)\nThe extra term k is included in order to allow us to rewrite the inequality as an equality.\nSubstituting this into equation (13) yields the Riccati equation\nA\u02dc\u2032P + PA\u02dc\u2212 PB\u02dcRB\u02dc\u2032P + C\u02dc \u2032C\u02dc = 0 (51)\nwhere R is defined as R = (2\u2212 k) (1\u2212\u000f)\n\u000f2\n\u03c9\u22121I . This allows us to replace R by R = \u03c1I where\n\u03c1 = (2\u2212 k)(1\u2212 \u000f)\n\u000f2\n\u03c9\u22121 (52)\nwhich yields Riccati equation (47) in Corollary 1. Similarly using the expressions for \u03c1 and\n\u03b3\u22122 in equation (15) allows us to write\nF = \u2212(R + W\n\u22121\n\u000f\n)B\u02dc\u2032PF = \u2212(1\u2212 \u000f)\u22121\n(\n1 +\n(k \u2212 1)\u000f\n2\u2212 k\n)\n\u03c1B\u02dc\u2032P (53)\nSimilarly, substituting this expression for F into equation (45) allows a cmax to be calculated\nas\ncmax = max\ni\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\nd\u00af2i\n\u03c12\n(\n1 + (k\u22121)\u000f\n2\u2212k\n)2\nB\u02dc\u2032iPB\u02dci\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8fe (54)\nNote that the expression for the Riccati equation is simpler than before (it is only a function of\n\u03c1) but the expression for the \u03b3 and the region of attraction are still not clear. However, note from\nequation (50), the effect of k can be offset to some extent by tuning W = \u03c9I appropriately.\nThus, if one simply fixes k = 1, it follows that the expressions for F and cmax reduce to those\ngiven in the Theorem \u0003\u0003\nRemark 3: The usefulness of Corollary 1 is in its ease of tuning: the three parameters (\u000f \u2208\n(0, 1), \u03c9 > 0 and \u03b3 > 0) of Theorem 3.1 have been replaced by just two (\u000f \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03c1 > 0).\nFurthermore, the Riccati equation in Corollary 1 is just a function of \u03c1 and is just a standard\nLQR-type Riccati equation which will always have a solution P = P \u2032 > 0 as (A\u02dc, B\u02dc, C\u02dc) are\nassumed stabilisable and detectable \u0003\nThis new formulation is appealing because the Riccati equation is purely a function of \u03c1 and\nan explicit bound on the local L2 gain is given by \u03b3. Another of the interesting features of\nthis new simplified strategy is that it allows precise mathematical conclusions to be drawn\nabout the trade-off between the local performance level and the region of attraction: it can be\n15\nobserved that equations (52) and (54) embody the trade-off between performance and region\nof attraction as they both involve \u03c1. In particular it is interesting to see how the region of\nattraction\u2019s size alters as a function of \u03c1. Note that the region of attraction could equivalently\nbe expressed as\nE\u00af =\n{\nx\u02dc \u2208 Rnp+m : x\u02dc\u2032\u03c1E(\u03c1)x\u02dc \u2264 1\n}\n, (55)\nE(\u03c1) := min\ni\n\u03c1P (\u03c1)\n\u03c1B\u02dc\u2032iPB\u02dci\nd\u00af2i\n= min\ni\n\u03c1P (\u03c1)\n\u03c1Pii(\u03c1)\nd\u00af2i\n(56)\nIt is difficult to characterise the size of this ellipsoid, but one way of doing so is by the sum of\nthe length of its semi-axes, which is equal to the trace of E\u22121(\u03c1), which can be written as\ntr[E\u22121(\u03c1)] = max\ni\nd\u00af2i tr\n{\n[\u03c1P (\u03c1)]\u22121[\u03c1Pii(\u03c1)]\n\u22121\n}\n(57)\nSo the key parameter which determines the \u201csize\u201d of the region of attraction is the matrix\n\u03c1P (\u03c1). We will establish how this varies as a function of \u03c1. First, multiply equation (47) by \u03c1\nto get\nA\u02dc\u2032P\u03c1 + \u03c1PA\u02dc\u2212 \u03c1PB\u02dcB\u02dc\u2032P\u03c1 + \u03c1C\u02dc \u2032C\u02dc = 0. (58)\nDefining Q(\u03c1) := P (\u03c1)\u03c1 > 0 we now have\nA\u02dc\u2032Q(\u03c1) + Q(\u03c1)A\u02dc\u2212Q(\u03c1)B\u02dcB\u02dc\u2032Q(\u03c1) + \u03c1C\u02dc \u2032C\u02dc = 0. (59)\nNow if (\u03c1\n1\n2 C\u02dc, A\u02dc) is detectable, it follows [28,39,16] that\ndQ(\u03c1)\nd\u03c1\n> 0, lim\n\u03c1\u21920\nQ(\u03c1) = 0. (60)\nFrom this it also follows that dQii(\u03c1)\/d\u03c1 > 0. Thus P (\u03c1)\u03c1 = Q(\u03c1) and \u03c1Pii(\u03c1) = Qii(\u03c1) are\nmonotonically increasing functions of \u03c1. Hence tr[E\u22121(\u03c1)] = maxi d\u00af2i tr[Q\n\u22121(\u03c1)Q\u22121ii (\u03c1)], is\na monotonically decreasing function of \u03c1 which implies that as \u03c1 increases, the \u201csize\u201d of the\nregion of attraction decreases. Furthermore, in the limit as \u03c1 tends to zero (\u000f \u2192 1 i.e. global\nresults), the region of attraction becomes the whole state-space.\nNote also that we can write F as\nF =\n\u22121\n1\u2212 \u000fB\u02dc\n\u2032Q(\u03c1), (61)\nand thus we can see that as \u03c1 becomes smaller, F becomes smaller (in the sense that its norm\nreduces) and as \u03c1 \u2192 0, F \u2192 0 and we recover the IMC solution; this also corresponds to\n16\n\u03b3 = \u221e. In other words, we have the \u201cworst\u201d performance for the IMC AW case (which is not\nsurprising since G\u02dc(s) is not bounded real). In conclusion we can see that\n\u03b3 \u221d 1\u221a\n\u03c1\nand |E\u00af | \u221d 1\n\u03c1\n, (62)\nmeaning that there is a clear trade-off between minimising the local L2 gain and maximising\nthe size of the region of attraction.\nRemark 4 The tuning procedure presented above states that for a given \u03c1 - and therefore for\na given performance bound and region of attraction - there exists a family of compensator\ngains, F , parametrised by \u000f \u2208 (0, 1). The parameter \u000f can be seen to play a similar role to\nthe free parameter in the low-high-gain design of [19] and one may expect some performance\nenhancement when \u000f is chosen close to unity. However, it is difficult to specify precisely what\nthis performance enhancement is. Experience suggests that when \u000f is chosen close to unity\n(i.e. F is \u201chigh gain\u201d) noticeably better time domain performance is observed when the states\nare close to the origin, but that this can worsen dramatically for states closer to the edge (but\nwithin) the ROA. When \u000f is chosen closer to zero (i.e. F is \u201clow gain\u201d), the difference between\nthe small and large signal performance of the compensators does not seem so noticeable and\nappears to allow the compensators to preserve stability for regions beyond the guaranteed\nROA.\n4 Example\nIn this section the effectiveness of the results are shown through a well known academic ex-\nample. Consider the problem of a missile auto-pilot as presented in [33,26,25], which is a third\norder two-input-two-output dynamic linear system. As required, the feedback interconnection\nof the plant and controller when no rate-limits are present is internally stable and well posed.\nHowever the \u201creal\u201d nonlinear system has actuators with rate constraints of\u00b13[deg\/s] imposed\nin both channels.\nFigure 6(a) shows the nominal linear response of the missile for a pulse r = [ 5 \u22125 ]. Notice the\ndecoupled outputs and swift but well-damped rise-times in both channels. However, it must be\nmentioned that the rate of the control signal exceeds the imposed limits and consequently the\nsystem with rate-limited actuators could exhibit a loss in performance and perhaps stability.\nFigure 6(b) confirms this and shows clearly how the system looses its decoupling and tracking\nproperties when rate-limits are introduced.\nTo limit the performance degradation during periods of rate saturation an AW compensator is\nintroduced. As mentioned earlier, for the rate saturated case, the task of choosing appropriate\nvalues of the design parameters presented in Theorem 3.1 is not as simple as in [32], but the\napproach is still intuitive. The designer\u2019s task can be simplified by using the tuning algorithm\nproposed in Section 3.5; we will concentrate on this approach.\n17\n0 5 10 15\n\u22125\n\u22124\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nTIME[s]\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\n[de\ng]\n0 5 10 15\n\u221280\n\u221260\n\u221240\n\u221220\n0\n20\n40\nTIME[s]\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\n[de\ng]\noutput signal output signal\n0 5 10 15\n\u221212\n\u221210\n\u22128\n\u22126\n\u22124\n\u22122\n0\n2\nTIME [s]\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\n0 5 10 15\n\u221220\n\u221215\n\u221210\n\u22125\n0\n5\nTIME [s]\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\ncontrol signal control signal\n(a) Nominal Response (b) Rate Saturated Response with no AW\nFig. 6. System Response\nCorollary 1 provides a simple way of characterising the performance level and stability region\nof the AW compensator. Notice that the available parameters are \u03c1 and \u000f, where \u03c1 gives a\nmeasure of nonlinear performance and \u000f defines the polyhedral set of allowed signals d, i.e.\nS(d0) = {d : \u2212d0 \u0016 d \u0016 d0}. The main goal of our design is to synthesize an AW compen-\nsator which guarantees stability in as large as set as possible while preserving performance\nas much as possible. As shown earlier, in order to achieve good performance (i.e. \u2016Tp\u2016i,2,W\nsmall), it is desirable to choose \u03c1 large; from equation (54) it can be concluded that for an en-\nlarged region of attraction \u03c1 must be small. In other words, the trade-off between performance\nand region of attraction is encapsulated in the design parameter \u03c1.\nThe main issue with the approach used in this paper is that it is local in nature: performance\nand stability guarantees are ensured only if d \u2208 S(d0). On the other hand, the conditions\npresented are only sufficient, and a system which does not guarantee d \u2208 S(d0) may still be\nstable within a large region of attraction (or perhaps the whole state space).

Rate-limited response of missile: nominal linear (solid), full-order AW \u03c1low (dash-dot), full-order\nAW \u03c1high (dash)\nthat the AW compensator can guarantee global (or semiglobal) stability, degradation of the\nclosed-loop compensated system\u2019s performance may still be present as the norm bound of the\nmap Tp no longer holds. In fact, after some analysis, it can be inferred that as the system moves\naway from the pre-established ROA, the gain \u2016Tp\u2016i,2,W increases, yielding an increase on the\nsystem\u2019s deviation from linear dynamics and hence a degradation of the prescribed nonlinear\nperformance.\nTo illustrate the design of AW compensators using Corollary 1, two compensators are de-\nsigned: \u000f = 0.9 is fixed and \u03c1 takes a values of \u03c1low = 10\u22124 and \u03c1high = 10 for the \u201clow\u201d and\n\u201chigh\u201d performance compensators respectively.\nFigure 7(a) depicts missile responses obtained with the \u03c1low and \u03c1high AW compensators re-\nspectively and a reference pulse with amplitude of \u00b15[deg]. Clearly in both cases the sys-\ntem\u2019s response is enhanced by the use of AW compensation: rate saturation levels are reduced,\n19\ntracking properties are retained and return to linear behaviour is well behaved. It is somewhat\nmore difficult to conclude which compensator delivers the best performance; for the low AW\ncompensator the second channel exhibits fast tracking performance while the first channel is\nsluggish. On balance however, one might say that the \u201chigh performance\u201d compensator does\nindeed perform better for this small input demand.\nFigure 7(b) illustrates the missile responses obtained with the two compensators when the ref-\nerence demands are increased to \u00b130[deg]. Such a large reference demand causes the system\nto depart from its guaranteed region of stability (i.e. d \/\u2208 S(d, do)) and while stability is not\nlost, performance does degrade. As the region of stability for the high performance compen-\nsator is smaller than that of the low performance compensator, it is not surprising that it\u2019s\nperformance deteriorates more. Although both compensators suffer a lack of tracking ability\nin the first channel (due to the restricted rate and short duration of the pulse demand), the low\nperformance compensator retains its tracking ability in the second channel and exhibits a re-\nduced phase-lag in the first channel. However, the high gain compensator is unable to preserve\nthis tracking performance and the second channel fails to follow that of the linear system well.\nIn conclusion, this example it appears preferable to accept a loss of small-signal performance\nin exchange for better preservation of large-signal performance.\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper has proposed an anti-windup scheme for systems with rate-limited actuators. The\nproposed synthesis algorithms have been constructed using ideas which are reasonably well\nknown in the AW literature, although the Riccati-based solution is novel and superior from a\ncomputational perspective. A key feature of the proposed AW algorithms is that they are fairly\neasy to tune and feature a parameter, \u03c1, which captures the trade-off between local performance\nand the size of a subset of the region of attraction.\nThe proposed algorithms have been demonstrated on a simple example, but their real use is\nenvisaged for complex, high order systems where LMI-based methods may have difficulty.\nThese algorithms were used for the design of the AW compensators for investigating rate-\nlimiting on the ATTAS aircraft. Details of the flight tests are reported in [4\u20136] but, broadly\nspeaking, it was found that the methods described within this paper are useful for designing\nAW compensators for complex, practical systems.\nReferences\n[1] Anon.
