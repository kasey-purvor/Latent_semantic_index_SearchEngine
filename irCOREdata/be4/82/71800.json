This paper explains why this was in fact not the case.  The paper is \ntherefore divided into two sections.  Firstly it reviews the literatures that help to explain \nfinancial geographies.  It is argued that we need to move away from investigating \nattribute properties such as financial turnover and instead examine the role of networks \nand interdependencies in producing financial geographies.  Secondly, it identifies \nLondon\u2019s dominance and Frankfurt\u2019s growth as a complementary centre through \nquantitative analysis and then explains how European networks and interdependencies \nproduce this based on insights from interviews with investment bankers and insurance \ninstitution workers in the two cities.  \n \n \nKeywords:   \n \nInternational financial centre network;   Europe;   Interviews;   Financial geographies;   \nLondon;    Frankfurt. \n3 \nIntroduction \n \nGeographers have long been asking what compels financial services to remain \nembedded within International Financial Centres (IFC\u2019s) when technology would seem to \nfacilitate de-concentration and geographical dispersion (O\u2019Brien, 1992).  Such questions \nhave been comprehensively answered (Budd 1999; Taylor et al, 2003) but the dynamics \nof the financial system mean these geographies cannot be assumed to be static.  One \nsignificant economic transformation has been the launch of Economic Monetary Union \n(EMU) and the Euro in January 1999 which raised questions about the continuation of \nestablished European financial geographies.  As an IFC London is accustomed to its \ndominant role in Europe.  This gives it not only financial supremacy built on an \nagglomeration of producer service firms (Thrift 1987) but also has effects on the city\u2019s \nbuilt environment and strategic planning (Pryke, 1994) and its business culture (Thrift, \n1994; Thrift and Leyshon, 1992).  However, The Financial Times (FT) was awash with \narticles leading up to the launch of the Euro questioning the implications of London being \noutside of EMU and the European Central Bank (ECB) locating in Frankfurt.  This was \nsaid to possibly mean \u201ca battle between London and Frankfurt\u201d (FT 7\nth\n July 1998) and a \n\u201cbitter war for supremacy\u201d (FT 10\nth\n July 1998).  Similarly, Fairlamb (1999) talked of the \n\u2018dueling markets\u2019 developing between London and Frankfurt because of EMU\u2019s \nimplications.  Moreover, although Frankfurt was seen as a small IFC because of its weak \nhistorical legacy in a decentralised urban system (Holfrerich, 1999) the city had began to \nstrive for a more international role (Keil and Ronneberger, 1994; Schamp, 1999).  Less \nthan 10 years ago then London\u2019s future as Europe\u2019s pre-eminent IFC seemed far from \nassured (see Johnston, 1996; Leyshon and Thrift, 1992).  However the reality today \ncontradicts those views with London continuing to be the dominant European IFC.  As \nHM Treasury (2003, 162) in their analysis of the impacts of the UK\u2019s position outside of \nEMU suggests, as regards attracting new business \u201c[t]he strength of the City in \ninternational wholesale financial services activity should mean that it continues to do so, \n4 \nwhether inside or outside EMU\u201d.  It therefore seems that we need to consider new ways \nof conceptualising IFC geographies in order to explain London\u2019s continued dominance.  \nThe aim of this paper then is to argue that London exists in a network of IFC\u2019s rather \nthan just as the apex of the European hierarchy as is often portrayed and that it is this \nnetwork that has sustained its pre-eminence.   \n \nThe rest of the paper is therefore divided into four sections.  In the following \nsection the paper evaluates the existing literatures on IFC\u2019s which view them as \nindependent centres with their location in a hierarchy determined by competitive attribute \nproperties.  In section two it introduces the notion of networks in order to provide a new \nconceptual framework for understanding European IFC\u2019s.  The idea of network relations \nand important spaces of flows between IFC\u2019s are discussed as a way of improving \nprevious analyses and explaining the continued dominance of London.  In section three \nboth quantitative data on financial centres and qualitative interviews with senior \npersonnel of institutions in London and Frankfurt are used to highlight the role of these \nprocesses in sustaining London\u2019s dominance and aiding Frankfurt\u2019s development as a \ncomplementary centre.  The final section provides conclusions suggesting how we may \ninterpret these findings and their significance for the way we study IFC networks in \ncontemporary globalisation.  It is proposed that instead of accepting a simple \nhierarchical view of the geography of IFC\u2019s we need a relational, networked analysis to \nunderstand London\u2019s continued dominance which is based on network \ninterdependencies providing global-local ties, connectivity and relationships with other \nIFC\u2019s.   \n \nHierarchical explanations of IFC geographies  \n \nGeographers have long had an interest in IFC\u2019s.  The work of Howard Reed (1981) \nexemplifies this in which he ranked IFC\u2019s based on their importance in the global \n5 \nfinancial system and suggested that to be an IFC required both the ability to handle and \nthe presence of a high volume of financial transactions \ni\n.  He produced a hierarchy of 80 \nIFC\u2019s in 40 countries with 5 functional divisions.  Table 1 shows the top ten IFC\u2019s \nidentified by Reed.  This work proved seminal for the study of IFC\u2019s but failed to answer \none of Reed\u2019s own questions, that being that in studies \u201cmissing are the factors required \nin the building of IFC pre-eminence\u201d (Reed, 1981, viii.)  In producing a hierarchy Reed \nsimply identified the different attributes of each centre rather than the processes which \nproduced them.   \n \n{ Insert table 1 here} \n \nReed\u2019s question has partially been answered by reference to the historical \ndimensions of IFC\u2019s growth.  For London the role of empire and the global trading links \nproduced are seen as critical with the Lloyds insurance market and its global reach \nbeing one of the most well known outcomes (Michie, 1991).  Explanations have been \nfurther advanced by Thrift (1987) who noted the importance of other producer service \nfirms in supporting IFC growth, something which is now central to agglomeration \ntheories (see Sassen, 2000).  Scholars have also highlighted three other attributes that \nexplain hierarchical geographies of IFC\u2019s. \n \nFirstly, the role of national regulatory factors as an important attribute \ndetermining an IFC\u2019s success has been noted (Pryke, 1991; Budd, 1995).  An \naccommodating regulatory environment it was argued gives certain IFC\u2019s \u201ccomparative \nadvantage over some territories\u201d (Budd, 1995, 352) with for example the de-regulation of \npension funds benefiting cities like London as new markets emerged around pension \nfund management and investment (Clark, 2001).  In recent times however many have \nbecome increasingly aware of the diminishing role such a process may have upon IFC \ngeographies (e.g. Martin, 1999) as supra-national agreements on regulation and \n6 \nfinancial standards mean the advantages of any one city have diminished (Roberts \n2002; Tickell 1999).  Budd (1999, 133) revised his argument and suggested this created \na \u2018crisis of embeddedness\u2019 as \u201c[t]he fundamental shift in the regulatory space of the \nproduction economy is being followed by a shift in the financial economy\u201d and no IFC\u2019s \nrole could be assured by national regulatory advantage alone.  \n \nSecondly, commentators have identified the \u2018imperfect\u2019 nature of capital markets \nand their informational content and how this reinforces geographies of finance (Clarke \nand O\u2019Connor, 1997; Tickell, 2000a).  Key social and cultural processes occurring in \nIFC\u2019s such as face-to-face contact facilitated by social proximity result in knowledge \nproduction critical to success (Boden, 2000; Thrift, 1994.)  In this logic IFC\u2019s provide a \nplace to access information whilst the need for it to be real time and contextualised make \nit impossible for technology to de-centralise activities with instead companies \nagglomerating in the city (Clark, 2002; Sassen, 2000).  Having the actors present in the \ncity who produce this knowledge is seen as a key attribute of a successful IFC.  \n \nThird, a functionality in these geographies has been identified in the form of what \nPorteous (1999, 106) calls \u201cinter-regional attachments\u201d whereby the pre-eminent IFC \nacts as an \u2018access point\u2019 for financial services for other cities.  As Budd (1999) noted, the \namount of trade occurring in London cannot be supported solely by the national \neconomy, but is provided from throughout Europe.  Not only is London a centre for the \nnation but also for the region of Europe.  Budd (1998) and Parr and Budd (2000) have \ndeveloped this idea using Central Place Theory and the work of Losch (1941) and \nChristaller (1933) to explain the geographies of finance we witness.  They suggest that \nLondon can be seen as a \u2018specialist\u2019 centre for global financial transaction because \n\u201c[h]igher order activities are located at central places, with intra-industry dispersion \ncorresponding to lower order activities\u201d (Budd 1998, 81) which occur in other centres.  \nHigher order centres in this model therefore have stronger attributes as an IFC.  \n7 \n \nAlthough this work highlights important attributes of successful IFC\u2019s it does not \nfully explain the processes which sustain the advantage of any one centre and say for \nexample why Frankfurt\u2019s markets have not grown and become the centre of European \nactivity.  If we follow the arguments to their logical conclusions Frankfurt should have \nbecome dominant for three reasons.  First, the de-territorialisation of financial regulation \nwould strip London of one of its competitive attributes whilst the UK\u2019s absence from EMU \ncould be seen as a regulatory factors favouring Frankfurt\u2019s growth.  Second, increased \nknowledge production should now occur in Frankfurt because of the ECB's location in \nthe city.  Third, as a result of the former factors, Frankfurt should have gained increased \nEuropean centrality in financial activities.  Cumulatively this should have placed the city \nin an upward spiral, attracting more and more financial institutions and firms and \nultimately threatening London\u2019s dominance in the European hierarchy.  This has not \nhappened.  Therefore, in order to understand London\u2019s continued dominance along with \nthe slight growth of Frankfurt it seems that we need to reconsider the way we look at \nIFC\u2019s.  Instead of viewing them in a hierarchy determined by the attribute properties of \neach centre the rest of this paper argues that they should be seen as the result of \nimportant interdependent networked geographies at the global and regional scale.  This \nprocess is more important than any \u2018territorial\u2019 attribute advantages alone as highlighted \nin hierarchy based comparative research.     \n \nNetworks, articulations and flows: Explaining the IFC network \n \nDrawing on the ideas of a range of commentators who view the effects of \ncontemporary globalisation as producing new network geographies it is possible to re-\nconceptualise the way we think about IFC\u2019s.  In this conceptualisation IFC networks exist \nas the result of an inter-meshing of global and local processes facilitated by various \nnetworks (Amin and Thrift, 1992; Allen and Pryke, 1994) producing what Sassen calls \n8 \n\u2018global networks and linked cities\u2019 (Sassen, 2002).  As Thrift long ago argued, \"there is \nno global financial structure \u2018out there\u2019, as a deus ex machina, but rather a spatially \ndistributed network of money\/social power which encompasses the globe\u2026 [The] local \nand the global intermesh, running into one another in all manner of ways.\" (Thrift, 1990, \n81, cited in Tickell, 2000b).   Friedmann\u2019s (1995) revised model of the world city system \nalso argues that it is \u2018spatial articulations\u2019 and network connections at scales from \u2018global \nfinancial articulations\u2019 (London) to \u2018multinational articulations\u2019 (Frankfurt) and national \narticulations (Amsterdam, Milan and Paris) which produce the world city system that \nexists.  In Friedmann\u2019s view it is the connections between cities which are of most \nimportant not their attribute properties.  A similar logic goes to make up Castells (2000) \n\u2018network society\u2019 in which the spaces of flows between \u2018key nodes\u2019 of the global system \nare central to financial activities and make certain locations pre-eminent.   \n \nThe development of all these logics by Jonathan Beaverstock, Peter Taylor and \ncolleagues (Beaverstock et al, 2000; Taylor, 2003) in relation to world cities and how it is \ntheir network which gives them \u2018power\u2019 in the world system further bolsters the argument \nfor such a method of analysis.  In their schema the \u2018strength\u2019 of a world city is defined by \nthe networks it has and the flows produced.  This is measured using the office network \nof transnational producer service firms and the resultant flows of capital, knowledge and \npeople into and out of the city.  In studying cities in such a way it is argued that we can \nbetter understand the interdependent network dynamics of contemporary (financial) \nglobalisation.   Based on this logic the \u2018Loughborough school\u2019 have produced a report \ninvestigating London and Frankfurt\u2019s relations as world cities which highlights increasing \nconnectivity in recent years (Beaverstock et al, 2001).  They argue that London and \nFrankfurt have developed increased network relations since the launch of the Euro as \nflows of knowledge, culture, power and governance develop as co-operation between \nfirms and authorities in the two cities increases.  What they do not explain however is \nwhy London has remained by far the pre-eminent European IFC as a result of this.  \n9 \nTaking this framework and applying it to this question provides an opportunity to \nreconsider the way we understand IFC\u2019s and explain why hierarchical based approaches \nlead many to believe London\u2019s pre-eminence was under threat.      \n \nIn a slightly different context, recent work on relational economic geographies \nhas further shed light on the need to examine relationships in the global economy and \nhow they give actors power and influence.  According to Dicken et al  (2001,94,original \nemphasis) these \u201cnetworks relationships should be understood as being both structural \nand relational\u201d as they \u201cconstitute structural power relations\u201d for those networked \ntogether and \u201care constituted by the interactions of variously powerful actors\u201d.  Only if we \nexamine the various scales at which these networks operate can we understand any \nglobally orientated activities.  The flows within these networks are critical and as Bathelt \nand Glucker (2003) note, when looked at through a geographical lens help explain \ngeographies of economic activity.  Such a mode of analysis helps reveal how all places \nare enmeshed within a wider context and need to be understood through their relations \nwith other actors, or in this case places.  By considering any place or IFC as a result of \nthe networks, flows and relations it has we can better understand and explain its role in a \nglobal system.   \n \nThe following section therefore draws on both the network and relational \ngeography literatures and argues that to understand London\u2019s continued pre-eminence \nin Europe we need to look at the role of IFC networks rather than using hierarchical \ncomparisons of territorial attributes.  It is argued that it is London\u2019s global and regional \nnetworks which have sustained its dominance whilst this is complemented by Frankfurt\u2019s \nrole as home of the ECB.  In the first section four key financial variables are quantified \nand in addition five non-financial variables which, amongst other attributes, help \nmeasure network connectivity.  Where possible and useful, change in these values \nbetween 1998 and 2001 (the most recent data available at the time of writing) is \n10 \nprovided to assess any obvious changes since the launch of the Euro \nii\n.  These values \nare then transformed to a base of 100 (where the pre-eminent centre\u2019s value is 100) in \norder to facilitate comparison between centres.   This both replicates in part Reed\u2019s \noriginal work but also advances it based on more recent insights into the importance of \nnetworks in contemporary globalisation and economic geographies.  Based on this \nanalysis, semi-structured interviews were completed in London and Frankfurt.  A sample \nof large financial organisations with a global office network was used with 12 interviews \ncompleted in all out of thirty organisations approached.  Interviews were conducted in \nperson in January 2001 and lasted between 60 and 90 minutes.  Interviewees held \nsenior positions as investment bankers or investors in insurance institutions.    For \nreasons of confidentiality the actual names of the organisations and interviewees are not \ngiven.  The aim of these interviews was to unpack these network processes which have \nsustained London\u2019s dominance but are not shown up through quantitative analysis.   \n \nRe-conceptualising the European hierarchy as a network \n \nTables 2 and 3 show the quantitative analysis of each IFC whilst tables 4 and 5 \nshow the values transformed to a base of 100.  As can be clearly seen, London remains \nfar the pre-eminent centre based on this analysis.  The value of its financial attributes \nare between 2.5 and 6 times greater than Frankfurt\u2019s whilst Frankfurt is far ahead of \nParis, which is above Amsterdam and Milan that have minimal trade and financial \nsignificance (tables 4 and 5).  Factor analysis revealed that no one variable could be \nheld responsible for the overall importance of an IFC.  The decrease in trade noted in all \ncentres between 1998 and 2001 (table 2) is attributed to the start of the current global \ndownturn and not the launch of the Euro.  This structure strongly reflects that identified \nby Reed in his original work with London remaining a truly globally orientated IFC with \nhigh levels of capital availability and trade unrivalled by any other European centre (table \n4 and 5).  However, the data also identifies the stronger growth (or least decline) of \n11 \nFrankfurt in recent years (table 2) but despite the launch of the Euro and the location of \nthe ECB in Frankfurt this has been insufficient to challenge London\u2019s dominance.  Data \nacting as proxies for network connectivity (all values in table 3 except tax burden) also \nshow significantly higher values for London than Frankfurt.   \n \nThe second part of this section then draws on interviews conducted to address \nthe specific issues raised by the launch of the Euro and to consider how network \nprocess at work may explain London\u2019s continued dominance.  It highlights the networks \nthat make London pre-eminent and also how Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Milan and Paris act \nas interdependent and complementary centres that help reproduce London\u2019s role. \n \n{ Insert tables 2,3,4 and 5 here } \n \nExplaining London\u2019s continued dominance in the network \n   \nIt became clear during interviews that London\u2019s continued dominance in the \nEuropean IFC network could be explained by its unique global-local networks.  As an \nIFC it is both part of the European network and also wider global networks.  Two \nimportant elements were highlighted by interviewees.   \n \nFirst, it became clear that a disproportionate amount of financial knowledge \nproduction occurs in the city.  For London, both the size of its financial markets and the \nagglomeration of financial firms (see table 3) ensures the existence of this process as \nworkers flow into the city from both within the UK and globally (Beaverstock and Smith, \n1996).  The launch of the Euro has done little to impact upon this.  It was argued that the \nlocation of the ECB in Frankfurt has given the city some advantages over its previous \nposition, attracting a new workforce to the city from within Germany and Europe, but this \nis a small issue compared with London\u2019s vast knowledge base driven by globally \n12 \nsourced labour.  This flow of workers into the city has continued because of the global \nimportance of the city compared to Frankfurt\u2019s relatively minor European significance.  \nAs two interviewees summed up: \n \n \n\u201cFrankfurt is not going to get global HQ\u2019s and their workforce\u2026ECB \nwatchers with their intellectual infrastructure gives a good image to the city\u2026 \n[However] look at New York and the federal reserve in Washington, its not \nthat significant, maybe 1600 people\u201d (4) \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a point where an IFC begins to develop critical mass then you get \nthings positively spinning off each other.  So we\u2019ve got an accounting \ninfrastructure, all the skills which are associated with banking and need to be \npresent for banking to be successfully conducted\u2026If other large players \ndecided the critical mass was in Frankfurt then London would have a \nproblem \u2013 but there\u2019s no sign of it yet.  Everyone wants to come to London\u201d  \n(9)  \n \n \nTwo important ideas are highlighted by the above quotes.  First, London remains magnet \nfor skilled workers.  The city attracts the elites needed to \u2018service\u2019 the financial industries \nfrom all over the world.  Second, and related to the first, London also attracts key \ntransnational businesses that Frankfurt does not making Frankfurt more of an \n'international banking centre' rather than a complete IFC with strength in all markets (see \ntable 3).  This gives London a greater relational connectivity with other cities both \nthrough flows of people via migration and business travel and flows of knowledge \nthrough virtual communications.  It is these networks which make London pre-eminent \nas the European centre of international financial knowledge whereas Frankfurt is a \ncentre of Euro knowledge, something which attracts far fewer inward and outward flows \nto the city.  Therefore, only if we understand why London remains a more important \ncentre for knowledge production (because of its local-global networks) can we begin to \nexplain the reasons for Frankfurt\u2019s limited growth.  \n \nSecond, interviewees acknowledge that the UK\u2019s absence from EMU could be \nseen as an advantageous regulatory factor for Frankfurt.  The city\u2019s centrality to the \n13 \nsystem should favour trading in the Euro, something that should attract business.  \nHowever, it was suggested that London\u2019s ability to exploit EMU to its best advantage \nthrough its regional networks has reduced any benefit this gave Frankfurt for two \nreasons.  First, London is part of and has access to the political networks of the EU and \ncan thus ensure that Euro trading regulations are moulded so to not disadvantage the \ncity.  Second, absence from EMU can be compensated for by providing trading systems \nwhich operate in the currency and are connected to Frankfurt and the ECB through \ncommunication networks allowing virtual trading.  As two interviewees specifically stated: \n \n\u201c London is a Euro centre as it has been a dollar centre since the 60\u2019s ... \nEuro, Yen and Dollar transactions all congregate in London.  Being part of \nthe European Community will facilitate doing cross-border trades and is \nhelpful to London because most regulation is laid down at the European \nlevel \u201d (6) \n \n\u201cThe hard fact is that London is a Euro centre just as it has been a Dollar \ncentre for over fifty years.  The processing systems work in Dollars \u2013 the \nsame thing is now precisely the same for the Euro.  You can pay premiums \nat Lloyds in Euro's, you can use money transfer systems to push money \ndown the wire to or from Frankfurt.  London is a Euro centre \u2013 a European \nasset not just a British asset\u201d  (12) \n \n \nThese comments clearly highlight the connectivity and relational nature of \nactivities in London.  Not only is the city connected to Europe by membership of the EU \nand the political networks this makes London part of, but also ICT based trading systems \nlink London to both Europe and other global IFC\u2019s.  Connections to the New York and \nTokyo markets are particularly important.  This is a unique position, reflecting \nFriedmann\u2019s idea that London is a global financial articulation. London provides services \nand financial fluidity unrivalled by any other IFC based on its regional European \nnetworks which allow trading in the Euro and also its global networks which allow firms \nin London to trade in other global markets and currencies.  As a result one interviewee \nargued that \u201c[t]he major players have consolidated business leading up to the launch of \nthe Euro\u201d (2) and wanted to be in London whilst another commented that \u201can IFC must \n14 \nbe a hypermarket, not a specialist retailer, with built up expertise, a financial centre in its \nentirety\u201d (8).  London\u2019s global and regional networks allow this.   Frankfurt lacks this \nglobal \u2018deep\u2019 integration which makes London so influential.  Instead, it has adopted a \nnew role as the location of the ECB which gives them a heightened significance and new \nregional networks to other European IFC\u2019s like Amsterdam, Milan and Paris. \n \nThe complementary network of European IFC\u2019s \n \nA new way of conceptualising the geographies of European finance as a network \nis therefore needed.  EMU has reorganised these networks in some ways but not \nchanged their key properties.  London\u2019s importance has been maintained because of the \nrelationships and connections it has, particularly at the global scale.  This help \nreproduces its role.  Frankfurt\u2019s growth has been based around Euro centred \ntransactions giving it a new significance beyond its role within Germany through new \nnetwork articulations.  The reorganised European network means Frankfurt has \nstrengthened relations with London whilst relations with Amsterdam, Milan and Paris are \nalso responsible for  recent growth as increasing flows of trade develop because of the \nECB\u2019s location in the city.  However, London remains pre-eminent providing truly global \nservice and connectivity which all European IFC\u2019s need to access and rely upon.  \nTherefore there is an interdependency of centres which is reproduced by the networks of \ntrade and knowledge between each city which exist in varying strengths.  London serves \na global role, Frankfurt a regional Euro based role, whilst Amsterdam, Milan and Paris \nact as domestic centres.   Most interviewees (10 out of 12) suggested such a \nphenomena was important and three specifically stated: \n \n\"There could be a kind of specialisation of different financial centres meaning \nfor example that Paris and Frankfurt are importing a lot of service from \nLondon \u2013 meaning they need the international structure London has.  Maybe \nthe idea of competition has been seen as too strong.  There is enormous \nfinancial growth in Europe and all centres can benefit.  London benefits as \n15 \nParis and Frankfurt develop their markets and there are certain services they \ncannot offer \u2013 especially in foreign exchange, in the eurobond area \u2013 that \nyou have to look to London.  There is a complementarity of centres. .  \nFrankfurt can\u2019t be a New York, but is it so bad to be a Washington or \nChicago?\u201d (1) \n \n\"The imperial thesis of London versus Frankfurt is not useful, Frankfurt can import \nuseful services from London, and in return be a key European link for the city. The \nnetwork model is already being alluded to whereby several cities each have their \nown role in European finance but remain interconnected\" (3) \n \n\u201cYou need to differentiate between the domestic financial market and the \nwider [international] financial markets.  All the evidence suggests in the \ninternational financial markets \u2013 bonds, foreign exchange \u2013  London \ncontinues to account for the largest share of activities.  Where you might get \nconsolidation of activities as a result of the Euro is in domestic financial \ntransactions and that won\u2019t necessarily mean a loss of business to London.  \nLondon is an international centre and offers largely different services \u2013 \ndealing with clients all over the world.  It almost offshore to the UK in the way \nit operates. Paris and Frankfurt want a bigger slice of the European action \nand you have to take that into account.  Having said that, there is a \ncomplementarity as regards their services.  In effect each has a role in its \nown right\u201d (9) \n \n \n \nThose working in the IFC\u2019s of London and Frankfurt are thus acutely aware \nof such a relationship developing and its implications for the functioning of \nEuropean finance.  It is interesting to note that interviewees in Frankfurt focussed \nmore upon how Frankfurt can complement London in its role as a Europe\u2019s pre-\neminent financial centre whilst those in London focussed upon how the City has a \ndominant role and this has continued.  Undoubtedly the increased connectivity and \nrelationships between London and Frankfurt in recent times have reinforced this \nbelief and negated any competitive behaviour.  The two IFC\u2019s complement one \nanother and work in a synergistic way to service the financial needs of Europe\u2019s \nbusinesses.  This can be seen in the strategy of many of the key transnational \nfinancial firms who continue to have offices in both city\u2019s but with most having their \nHQ or largest office in London.  A new form of relationship has developed in many \ncases between these offices with flows of work and personnel between London \nand Frankfurt intensifying and the \u2018London-Frankfurt commute\u2019 from City Airport to \n16 \nFrankfurt now being something common to those involved in finance.  At the same \ntime firms in Amsterdam, Milan and Paris have developed increasing relations with \nFrankfurt.  For these firms the networks and relations between cities are now \ncritical.  As a result there is a European network of IFC\u2019s rather than a hierarchy.  \nEach centre has a specific role that is reproduced by its interdependent \nrelationships with other IFC\u2019s.  However, London remains dominant in this network \nbecause of its unique global-local networks that other European IFC\u2019s are \ndependent upon.  \n \n \nConclusions: The IFC network \n \nIn this paper it has been argued that the geography of European IFC\u2019s should be \ndepicted as a relational network in contemporary globalisation.  The continued pre-\neminence of London in the European financial network can be explained when such an \napproach is used.  It has cultivated a global network that means it is a centre for global \nfinancial transactions and therefore attracts many of the key global financial institutions \nand firms.  Flows of capital, knowledge, trade, people and political influence (within both \nthe EU and wider global financial networks) result from and reinforce this role in the \nnetwork.  No other IFC in Europe has achieved this to such an extent and thus London\u2019s \ndominance of European networked financial systems.  The launch of EMU has simply \nre-organised the European network to give Frankfurt a new regional role.  The city has \nbeen growing in recent years but principally based on domestic trade and increased \nEuro based trading thanks to the location of the ECB in the city.  It cannot however \nprovide the same services as London because of its lack of global connectivity.  Adding \nan attribute to the centre in the form of the ECB has not altered this although the \nreorganisation of the European network it caused has benefited Frankfurt.  For Frankfurt, \n17 \nand other European IFC\u2019s then, London still has a vital role for truly global trading and \nfor European financial activities of global firms.   \n \nAt the same time however all of the European IFC\u2019s are complementary to one-\nanother with Frankfurt\u2019s European role complementing London\u2019s more global role.  This \nhas produced increased connectivity and flows between the two centres since the \nlaunch of the Euro.  These flows of capital, trade in each-others markets and people \nhave become increasingly important.  Amsterdam, Milan and Paris act as \u2018national\u2019 \ncentres that complement both London and Frankfurt.  In effect then London is now \nrelationally closer to Frankfurt because of the launch of the Euro whilst Amsterdam, \nMilan and Paris remain relationally more distant.  The proximity between London and \nFrankfurt has not however lead to an eroding of London\u2019s pre-eminence but has instead \nreinforced it.  Global-local networked interdependencies therefore exist between \nEuropean IFC\u2019s and produce an European network of IFC\u2019s.  Analysing the system from \nthis perspective helps explain why London has remained dominant since the launch of \nEMU. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18 \nAcknowledgements \n \nI am indebted to Jon Beaverstock\u2019s invaluable help and advice regarding the planning \nand execution of this research and his comments on previous drafts of this paper.
