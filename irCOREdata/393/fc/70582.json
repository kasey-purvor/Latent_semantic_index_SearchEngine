Hay and Mary M. Smyth \nLancaster University \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n2 \n \n \nAbstract \n \n \nA version of the Hebb repetition task was used with faces to explore the generality of the effect in \na non-verbal domain. In the baseline condition, a series of upright faces was presented and \nparticipants asked to reconstruct the original order. Performance in this condition was compared \nto another in which the same stimuli were accompanied by concurrent verbal rehearsal to \nexamine if Hebb learning is dependent on verbal processing. Baseline performance was also \ncompared to a condition in which the same faces were presented inverted. This comparison was \nused to determine the importance in Hebb learning of being able to visually distinguish between \nthe list items. The results produced classic serial position curves that were equivalent over \nconditions with Hebb repetition effects being in evidence only for upright faces and verbal \nsuppression as having no effect. These findings are interpreted a posing a challenge to current \nmodels derived from verbal domain data. \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n3 \n \n \nThe processing of serial order has been extensively investigated with a number of connectionist \nand mathematical models developed to explain how this is done in the context of short-term \nmemory (STM) (e.g. Henson, 1998; Page & Norris 1998; Burgess & Hitch; 1999; Neath & Brown, \n2006). However, the data on which these are built have been gathered almost exclusively from \nthe verbal domain. It is only recently that attempts have been made to determine the domain \ngenerality of serial order processes. In a key set of experiments Smyth, Hay, Hitch & Horton, \n(2005) used faces in a serial reconstruction task arguing that such stimuli have well-developed \nencoding processes and are highly familiar making these a more accurate visual-domain analogue \nto words than the random matrices used in many previous studies (e.g. Avons, 1998). Smyth et al  \nfound serial position curves resembling those found in the verbal domain and similar patterns of \ntransition errors. These were found even with concurrent verbal suppression indicating the \nimportant elements of serial order processing in STM may be general across modalities and are \nnot a function of verbal encoding or sub-vocal rehearsal. \n \nThe longer term learning of serial order has been less extensively studied but the \nsituation is similar in that this has been conducted almost exclusively within the verbal domain \n(e.g. Hebb, 1961; Melton, 1967; Cumming, Page & Norris, 2003). The methodology generally \nemployed is derived from that used by Hebb (1961) and requires participants to perform a verbal \nserial recall task in which one of the lists is repeated every third trial. In comparison to the non-\nrepeated trials, recall of the unannounced repeated list improves, producing what is termed the \nHebb repetition effect. Recently however, there have been attempts to explore the Hebb repetition \neffect in other domains. For example, Page, Cumming, Norris, Hitch & McNeil (2006) explored this \neffect in a series of experiments that compared performance with letters and pictures presented \nvisually. They found consistent evidence of a Hebb repetition effect across stimulus types, even \nunder conditions of verbal suppression. Similarly, Couture & Tremblay (2006) using a derivative \nof the Corsi blocks task found equivalent learning rates for visuospatial dot sequences and \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n4 \n \n \nauditory letter strings. Together, these studies challenge the accepted view of Hebb repetition \neffects as having a verbal basis.   \n \n The present study had two main aims; first to further examine the generality of the Hebb \nrepetition effect within the visual domain by using human faces as stimuli.  Unfamiliar faces are \ncomplex visual stimuli constructed from the same features yet give rise to an infinite number of \nexemplars that are difficult to verbally encode (Ellis, 1975; Smyth et al, 2005).  They require both \nlow level pattern processing and higher order encoding of the relationships for recognition \n(Murray 2004) and allow the exploration of serial order phenomenon in the absence of output \ncodes or output-based rehearsal (Smyth et al, 2005). Although the existing evidence suggest that \nunfamiliar faces are not verbally encoded we decided to employ a verbal suppression technique to \nspecifically determine any role that verbal rehearsal may have in producing the Hebb repetition \neffect with visual stimuli. \n \n The second aim was to expand on the work of Melton (1967) who explored the conditions \nunder which the Hebb repetition effect occurs. Using two distinct consonant sets of eight items, \nMelton varied the relationship between Hebb trial items and the non-repeated lists. In the similar \ncondition, both lists were constructed from the same set and in the dissimilar condition Hebb \nitems came from one list and the non-repeated items from the other. It was only in the latter \ncondition that Hebb learning was found, suggesting that item distinctiveness may be crucial in \ndetermining Hebb learning. Distinctiveness has also been shown to be a key component in \ndetermining serial position function shape in short-term visual memory tasks. Hay, Smyth, Hitch \n& Horton (2007) used unfamiliar faces in a Sternberg (1966) probe task and found that inverted \nunfamiliar faces produced the previously reported flat serial position curves with last item \nrecency (Phillips & Christie, 1977). In contrast, the same faces shown upright produced a recency \ngradient over the recently presented items. This pattern of results was predicted by the SIMPLE \nmodel (Neath & Brown, 2006), which is based on two forms of distinctiveness. One related to the \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n5 \n \n \ntemporal position of items and one reflecting the psychological distinctiveness of the items. Hay et \nal showed that under the same temporal presentation conditions, the indices of psychological \ndistinctiveness derived by the SIMPLE model for upright and inverted faces are different and that \nthis was responsible for the change in function shape. Our intention here is to use upright and \ninverted faces in a Hebb learning task to determine if changes in the distinctiveness of visual \nmaterial produced similar effects to those observed by Melton (1967) in the verbal domain. \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nFifty-four students from Lancaster University aged between 18 to 32 years and with a \nmean age of 24 years, participated in this study. These were allocated at random to one of three \nconditions.  Of the eighteen participants in the first (the baseline condition), 7 were males and 11 \nfemales, in the second (the verbal suppression condition) there were 6 males and 12 females, and \nin the third (the inverted face condition), 8 were males and 10 were females. All participants had \nnormal or corrected-to-normal vision and received payment for participating in the study.  \n \nMaterials and Apparatus \nThe stimuli consisted of 15 unfamiliar Western-European\/Caucasian faces. The faces \nwere in greyscale and standardised to a height of 100 points (approximately 1.5 inches\/4cm). The \nfaces were all male, of a similar age, with similar hair colour. The faces were selected for their \nvisual similarity and so had only small variations in hairstyle, skin tone and face shape (see \nfigure 1). The faces were allocated at random to form three sets of five faces (denoted as A, B & \nC). The face stimuli sets were rotated 180\u00b0 in order to form the unfamiliar inverted face sets. \n \n \n \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n6 \n \n \n---------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 1 here \n---------------------------------------------------------- \n \nAll faces were presented on a white background using an Apple PowerBook G4 attached to \nan Iiyama 17\u201d touch-screen display. Screen resolution was set to 1024x768 with a screen refresh \nof 75Hz. \nDesign \nThe three conditions employed the same presentation and response procedure described \nbelow. The first condition was the baseline condition in which upright faces were presented. To \ndetermine the role of verbal encoding in producing a Hebb repetition effect, the second condition \nrequired participants to view the same upright faces while engaging in concurrent verbal \nsuppression. Lastly, to investigate the role of stimulus class distinctiveness on the Hebb \nrepetition effect participants in the third condition viewed the same faces as in the baseline \nexcept that these were inverted.  \n  \nProcedure \nFor each participant, one set of faces was denoted as the Hebb learning set; the \nremaining two sets of faces were denoted as the non-Hebb learning sets. Allocation of these sets \nwas counter-balanced over participants who were presented with 18 trials. Every third trial, \nbeginning with trial 3 (i.e. on trials 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 & 18), was a trial in which the faces from the \nHebb set were repeated in the same order. Two interleaved non-Hebb learning sets appeared once \neach before each Hebb presentation (i.e. on trials 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16 & 17) with the \nnon-Hebb trial faces shown in a different random serial position on successive presentation.  \n \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n7 \n \n \nParticipants were tested individually and sat approximately 60cm from the computer \ndisplay. For each trial, a ready signal appeared just below the centre of the display for 1 second \nfollowed 1 second later by the first in the series of five faces. All faces were presented in the \ncentre of the display and each face was presented for 1 second with an inter-stimulus interval \n(ISI) of 1 second. Following the presentation of the last face in the series there was a delay of 2 \nseconds before the entire set of faces was re-presented in a circular array centred on the middle \nof the display. The location of the faces to this circular array was random for each trial. Each face \nwas positioned in one of eight fixed spatial locations equidistant from each other. \n \nThe task describe to participants was to reconstruct the order of the items presented \nusing the touch-screen display. Once an item had been chosen this was removed from the display \nso that participants were unable to amend their response. If participants were unsure of the next \nitem in the sequence, they were instructed to guess. When all items had been selected, \nparticipants received the next trial after a gap of 1 second and no feedback was supplied.  \n \nIn the baseline condition faces were presented upright with participants given no other \ninstructions. In the condition with concurrent verbal suppression, participants were required to \nrepeat the phrase \"1,2,3,4\" continuously at a rate of three words per second for the duration of \nthe experimental run. Prior to testing, participants listened to an example recording of a female \nvoice repeating this phrase. During the task, the experimenter monitored the pace of articulatory \nsuppression to ensure that a suitable rate of speech was maintained. The third condition was \nidentical in all respects to the baseline except here the faces were inverted and participants were \ninstructed to maintain an upright head posture at all times. \n \n \n \n \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n8 \n \n \nResults \n \n Each participant received two types of trial; six Hebb learning trials in which the \nsame faces appeared in the same serial position on each presentation and twelve non-Hebb \ninterleaved trials in which faces appeared in different serial positions on each trial. For each \nserial position on each trial, a participant\u2019s response was classified as correct only if the correct \nface was selected in the correct serial position. As there were two non-Hebb \u2018filler\u2019 trials, \ninterleaved between consecutive Hebb trials, the data from these trials were averaged over serial \nposition to form a single data point allowing easier comparison of Hebb and non-Hebb trials.  \n \nAs there were 3 different Hebb face sets we explored if these produced varying Hebb \nrepetition effects by using a mixed 3 x 6 x 2 x 5 ANOVA (Hebb face set x trial x type of trial x \nserial position) where Hebb face set was the between factor. This revealed no reliable differences \nbetween the sets or any interactions and so this factor was omitted from all subsequent analyses. \n \nHebb repetition effects and verbal suppression \nTo investigate whether a Hebb repetition effect is found with upright unfamiliar faces and \nto determine the impact of verbal suppression the data from the baseline condition were compared \nto that from concurrent verbal suppression condition. These were subjected to a mixed 2 x 2 x 5 x \n6 ANOVA (no suppression\/verbal suppression x Hebb\/non-Hebb trial x serial position x trial) in \nwhich type of verbal suppression was the between factor. Although the main effect of verbal \nsuppression approached reliability, F(1,34) = 3.11, MSe = 1.47, p = 0.09, no interactions involving \nthis factor were observed.  \n \nA reliable serial position effect was found, F(4,136) = 9.43, MSe = 0.10, p < 0.001, h2 = \n0.22 revealing the standard bow-shaped curve with pronounced primacy and lesser recency. No \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n9 \n \n \ninteractions involving this factor were observed indicating a consistency of effect across Hebb \nand non-Hebb trials and across verbal suppression conditions (see Figure 2). \n \n---------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 2 here \n---------------------------------------------------------- \n \nCrucially, there was a clear advantage for repeated Hebb trials compared to non-repeated trials, \nF(1,34) = 75.45, MSe = 0.27, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.69. This main effect was modified by an interaction \nbetween type of trial and trial number, F(5,170) = 2.81, MSe = 0.21, p = 0.018, h2 = 0.08. \nAdditional analyses indicated a reliable Hebb repetition effect both in the baseline condition, \nF(5,85) = 3.56, MSe = 0.16, p = 0.008, h2 = 0.17, which showed a strong linear increasing trend \nover trials, F(1,17) = 14.88, MSe = 0.12, p = 0.001, h2 = 0.47, and under conditions of verbal \nsuppression, F(5,85) = 3.36, MSe = 0.24, p = 0.008, h2 = 0.17.  Again a reliable linear increase \nover trials was found, F(1,17) = 9.83, MSe = 0.28, p = 0.006, h2 = 0.37.  \n \n To determine if the degree of repetition learning was influenced by verbal suppression, \nthe number correct on each Hebb trial for each participant in both the baseline and the verbal \nsuppression conditions was calculated. From these the gradient of the best fitting straight line \nwas computed for each participant using the least-squares method. The gradients were subjected \nto ANOVA with condition as the single between factor. This indicated no reliable difference \nbetween the slopes of the baseline and the verbal suppression conditions, F(1,34) = 0.89,  MSe = \n0.08, p > 0.05.  \n \n A similar set of analyses on the data from the non-repeating trials revealed no changes in \nperformance over trials and no evidence of reliable linear trends (see figure 3). \n \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n10 \n \n \n---------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 3 here \n---------------------------------------------------------- \n \nHebb repetition effects with upright and inverted faces \n The data from the baseline condition and the inverted face condition were subjected to a \nmixed 2 x 2 x 5 x 6 ANOVA (upright\/inverted faces x Hebb\/non-Hebb trial x serial position x \ntrial) in which face orientation was the between factor. This revealed a main effect of serial \nposition, F(4,136) = 13.24, MSe = 0.13, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.28. Standard bow-shaped curves were \nagain observed with a strong primacy effect and a lesser recency effect on the last one or two \ntrials. As before, no interactions involving this factor were observed indicating a consistency of \neffect across Hebb and non-Hebb trials irrespective of face orientation (see Figure 2). \n \n Two other main effects were observed; better reconstruction performance with upright \nthan inverted faces, F(1,34) = 23.62, MSe = 1.10, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.41, and better performance on \nrepeated Hebb trials than on non-repeated trials, F(1,34) = 10.56, MSe = 0.37, p = 0.003, h2 = \n0.24. More importantly, these factors were found to interact, F(1.34) = 14.28, MSe = 0.37, p \n=0.001, h2 = 0.30. Simple main effect analyses (SME) revealed a Hebb effect with upright faces, \nF(5,85) = 3.54, MSe = 0.06, p = 0.006, h2 = 0.17, with a reliable linear component that increased \nover trial, F(1,17) = 19.52, MSe = 0.11, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.53. In contrast no Hebb repetition effect \nwith inverted faces (see figure 3) and no evidence of any linear trend was observed. The SME \nanalyses on the non-Hebb trials indicated that no performance changes were associated with \nupright or inverted faces nor were there any reliable linear trends (see figure 3). \n \nSerial Position Effects \n In order to compare the serial position effects across the three conditions the data from \nthe non-repeating lists were compared. A 3 x 5 x 6 (baseline\/verbal suppression\/inverted face \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n11 \n \n \ncondition x serial position x trial) mixed ANOVA revealed a main effect of serial position effect, \nF(4,204) = 13.16, MSe = 0.08, p < 0.001, h2 = 0.21, but no reliable effect of condition, F(1,51) = \n2.61, MSe = 0.86, p > 0.05 and no interaction between these factors, F(8,204) = 0.48, MSe = 0.08, \np > 0.05. Together these indicate similar serial position patterns across the three conditions for \nnon-repeating lists.  \n \n A further ANOVA was conducted to determine if any serial position differences were \nassociated with repeated and non-repeated lists with inverted faces. A 2 x 5 x 6 (type of Hebb \ntrial x serial position x trial) repeated measures ANOVA indicated that there was no reliable \ndifference between repeated Hebb and non-repeated trials, F(1,17) = 1.26, MSe = 0.15, p > 0.05, or \na reliable Type of Hebb trial x serial position interaction, F(4,68) = 0.12, MSe = 0.13, p > 0.05, \nindicating that repeated inverted face lists behave similarly to non-repeated lists. \n \nDiscussion \n \n These results confirm the findings of Smyth et al (2005) in showing unfamiliar faces \nproduce serial position curves similar to those obtained within the verbal domain. In addition, \ninverted faces, which have the same visual complexity as upright faces but do not engage the \nnormal face processing system (Murray, 2004) also produce bow-shaped curves with considerable \nprimacy and reduced recency indicating that the same processes for handling serial position \nwithin the context of STM are employed. In addition, performance with inverted faces is at a \nsimilar level to that with upright faces indicating that any differences cannot be due to floor \neffects. This observation that the serial position effects in this task do not differ depending on the \nnature of the stimulus material is in contrast to Hay et al (2007). However this was a probe task \ndesigned to examine short-term visual memory and did not require any encoding or use of \nposition information. In contrast, in the current reconstruction task it is not visual memory for \nitems that is being examined \u2013 the items were presented at response - but memory for the \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n12 \n \n \nposition of items in the list. Thus, there was little expectation of visual distinctiveness playing a \nmajor role in this task in this part of the experiment. \n \n When considering the longer term learning of serial order, our results confirm that Hebb \nrepetition effects are not restricted to the verbal domain. We have added to the previous findings \nusing object pictures (Page et al, 2006) and visuospatial dot sequences (Couture & Tremblay, \n2006) in demonstrating that better memory for repeated serial lists, can also be observed in the \nvisual domain with novel faces. Importantly we have highlighted the conditions under which Hebb \neffects are observed by demonstrating that these are in evidence for upright faces but not when \nthe same faces are shown inverted. \n  \n Several verbal domain models of serial learning, based on Baddeley\u2019s (1986) working \nmemory model, suggest that visual material can be verbally encoded and rehearsed using what is \nknown as the phonological loop (e.g. Henson1998, Page & Norris, 1998). The fact that unfamiliar \nfaces are known to be difficult to verbally label (Ellis 1975) together with the observation here of \na Hebb repetition effect under conditions of concurrent verbal suppression, demonstrates that \nthis effect cannot be the result of verbal recoding and subvocal rehearsal. Further, our results \nindicate that the linear increase in performance on Hebb trials is the same irrespective of \nwhether concurrent verbal suppression is employed. This is similar to the Page et al (2006) result \nin the verbal domain with letters (Expt. 1) and extends their work with object pictures where \ntheir design did not allow a comparison between a baseline and a concurrent verbal suppression \ncondition to be made. These results are also problematic for models that suggest the Hebb effect is \ndue to other forms of rehearsal (e.g. Burgess & Hitch, 1999) or output processes (e.g. Cohen & \nJohansson, 1967) as unfamiliar faces have no direct access to an output system and do not allow \nrehearsal via any known internal analogue (Smyth et al 2005). \n \n Although there is considerable divergence among researchers as to what underpins the \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n13 \n \n \nHebb repetition effect (Couture & Tremblay, 2006), the present results together with the work of \nMelton (1967) have identified one necessary factor. That is item visual distinctiveness.  Hay et al \n(2007) have already demonstrated that inverted faces have lower function power indices in the \nfunctions produced by the SIMPLE model. These in turn, are hypothesised to reflect differences in \nitem distinctiveness (Neath & Bower, 2006). However, since distinctiveness can be a nebulous \nconcept, Hay et al (2007) attempted to specify what this meant for the upright and inverted faces \nused in their short-term visual memory task.  \n \n  They found that in a short-term visual memory (STVM) probe task using upright and \ninverted faces the latter had higher values of psychological distinctiveness calculated using the \nSIMPLE model (Neath & Brown, 2006). They suggest that this reflects the existing mechanisms \nfor encoding and storing faces within an existing multidimensional space whose dimensions have \ndeveloped to best discriminate exemplars (Valentine 1991). This is not true for inverted faces. \nThese have probably never been previously encountered and consequently have a representational \nspace that is minimally populated with dimensions that have yet to be sufficiently determined. \nBoth of these change as a result of perceptual learning which has been shown to be accompanied \nby increases in both memory and perceptual sensitivity (Palmeri, Wong & Gauthier, 2004). The \ncurrent observation of a Hebb repetition effect only with upright faces indicates that the ability to \nencode list exemplars distinctively may be crucial. This link between distinctiveness and the \nobservation of a Hebb repetition effect has also been found within the verbal domain. Melton \n(1967) reported a series of experiments using consonants where the distinctiveness of the items \nin the repeated lists and the non-repeated lists was systematically varied.  In one condition, all \nlists were constructed from the same nine consonants while in the other the repeated and the \nnon-repeated lists were constructed from different consonant sets. Only when the repeated lists \nwere distinctive from non-repeated lists was a Hebb effect observed.  \n \n In conclusion, studies in domains other than the verbal provide useful insights for those \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n14 \n \n \nmodelling the short and longer term processing of serial order. The similarities between the \nresults with verbal and visuospatial studies, suggests some common underlying processes. If so, \nthis poses difficulties for many of the existing computational models, which now appear too \ndomain specific and invoke explanatory mechanisms that do not obviously generalise to other \ndomains. \n \n  \nHebb Learning in the Visual Domain \n15 \n \n \nReferences \n \nAvons, S.
