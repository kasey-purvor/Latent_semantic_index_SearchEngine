Despite the decrease in band gap, the conduction\nband ~cb! edge effective mass has been observed to rise with\nincreasing N content,5,6 contrary to the prediction of usual\nk\"p theory. The strong band gap bowing and increase in\neffective mass arise because of a repulsive interaction be-\ntween the conduction band edge and a higher lying band of\nnitrogen resonant states.7\u20139\nThe band structure of InNxSb12x can be predicted using\na modified k\"p Hamiltonian previously developed for\nGaNxAs12x .7,8 In this model, the Hamiltonian describing the\ninteraction between the cb edge and nitrogen resonant level\nis given by\nHN ,C5S EN2ax bAxbAx EC2gx D . ~1!\nThe parameters a, b, g, and the energy of the nitrogen\nresonant level, EN , can be found by analyzing the results of\na tight binding model we have developed.9 In the case of\nInNxSb12x , the cb energy EC50.177 eV ([7 mm), and we\ncalculate EN50.647 eV, a5g50.77 eV, and b52.2 eV.\nThe band gap is therefore predicted to decrease to 110 meV\nat 1% N, a fractional change of almost 40%.

In compres-\nsively strained layer heterostructures a reduced valence band\nmass has the effect of reducing the excited carrier density\nrequired for emission @Fig. 1~b!#. This reduction in n in-\ncreases tAuger directly via Eq. ~2!.11 In addition the increase\nin m leads to a reduction in C .\nFigure 1 shows the band structure of InNxSb12x for x\n50% and 0.6%, calculated using a ten band model ~doubly\ndegenerate N level, conduction band, heavy, light, and split-\noff hole bands!. Because of the effects of N incorporation,\nthe room temperature energy gap at x50.6% has dropped to\n0.113 eV ([11 mm), but the band edge mass has only\ndropped from 0.010 to 0.008. If we set x50 and Eg\n50.113 eV ~i.e., considering an equivalent band gap, hypo-\nthetical, Kane bandstructure material!, the mass drops by\ntwice as much to 0.006. We note that the only realizable\nequivalent gap Kane material, Hg0.83Cd0.17Te, has a band\nedge mass yet smaller than 0.006. In other words the band\nedge mass is much larger than expected for a Kane material.\nThis may provide a way of reducing C at long wavelengths,\neven without strain @Fig. 1~c!#. Away from the zone center\nthere is a strong anticrossing where the band meets the N\nlevel, and the resulting increased cb nonparabolicity has a\nsimilar effect. Finally, the mixing of the localized nitrogen\nlevels into the conduction band ~again, more strongly at high\nk! suppresses the matrix element for Auger recombination.\nIn this work we show experimentally that the Auger lifetime\nis indeed enhanced over bulk Kane band structure materials,\nand thus that the N-alloy system is promising for laser appli-\ncations.\nThe samples used were undoped and grown by molecu-\nlar beam epitaxy on semi-insulating GaAs substrates. Sample\nA had a 3.25 mm InSb strain-relaxing buffer, followed by six\nrepeats of (33 nm InNxSb12x , 33 nm InSb! nominally with\nx53.5%, and 0.5 mm InSb cap. Sample B had a similar\nbuffer and cap, but a 2-mm-thick epilayer of x50.4%.\nSample C was similar to B with x50.6%.\nThe time-resolved optical measurements were performed\nusing the Dutch free electron laser ~FELIX! and are de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere.12 A strong pump pulse com-\npletely bleaches the transmission by increasing the separa-\ntion between the quasi-Fermi levels (DF) up to the pump\nphoton energy (\\vpump). The pump-induced transparency\nwas measured with a weak probe pulse delayed in time after\nthe pump. The size of the transmission change is directly\nrelated to excited carrier concentration ~and the joint density\nof states at the pump wavelength!, but it is not necessary to\nknow this dependence to measure a lifetime. The absorption\nedge of the sample was determined by measuring the wave-\nlength at which the bleaching effect at zero delay disappears\n~in effect a modulated transmission technique!. The room\ntemperature absorption edges of samples A, B, and C\nwere511, 14, and 15 mm, respectively, showing clearly how\nincorporation of N may move the band gap of III\u2013V alloys to\nlower energies than previously achieved.\nDownloaded 26 Feb 2008 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tPump-probe results are shown in Fig. 2 for sample A at\nroom temperature, a pump wavelength of 10 mm, and plotted\non a log-linear scale so that 1\/t is the slope. There is a rapid\ndecay ~steep slope! corresponding to an initial lifetime per\nexcited carrier of 300 ps. The decay rate slows with increas-\ning delay, i.e., with decreasing n , as determined by Auger\nrecombination @Eq. ~2!#. After about 200 ps n ~and, hence,\nCn2! has reduced sufficiently that the decay has become a\nsingle exponential dominated by Shockley\u2013Read\u2013Hall\n~SRH! processes. The latter process is associated with a con-\nstant lifetime ~independent of n and t!, i.e., a straight line on\nFig. 2. This lifetime, which is not an intrinsic property of the\nmaterial, is quite short, tSRH52.6 ns, due to the poor\nmorphology of the samples considered. Similar time-\ndependent lifetime results were obtained at other tempera-\ntures and with the other samples\u2014e.g., the initial lifetime for\nsample B at 10 K ~at which temperature the band gap was\n0.124 eV [10 mm! with pump photon energy 0.260 eV\n([4.9 mm) was 130 ps.\nWe concentrate in the present work on the rate of the\nAuger process at the moment in time where DF is known,\ni.e., when DF5\\vpump immediately after the pump pulse\nbleaches the system. In order to determine C it would be\nnecessary to know how the transmission varies with n , but\nthis requires detailed knowledge of the density of states, in-\ncluding quantization effects, strain, disorder, etc. We note\nthat the lifetime at the threshold quasi-Fermi level separa-\ntion is what determines the threshold current in a laser de-\nvice, and here we determine t(DF) unambiguously.\nAlso shown on Fig. 2 for comparison are the Auger de-\ncay curves for Kane band structure materials calculated using\nthe \u2018\u2018flat valence band approximation\u2019\u2019 13 ~which we have\npreviously shown gives good agreement with experiment in\nthe HgCdTe system12!. We ignore SRH for this purpose and\nradiative transitions are negligible in this temperature\/density\nregime. The solid line on the figure is for Hg12yCdyTe with\nEg50.113 eV ([11 mm), i.e., the same band gap as sample\nA, and using a starting (t50) value of DF50.124 eV\n([10 mm), i.e., the same as the pump wavelength used in\nFIG. 2.

The decay curve for HgCdTe with the\nsame density, but in this case the band gap of InSb ~7 mm!,\nis also shown, and has an initial Auger lifetime of 270 ps,\ncomparable to that of the N alloy. Finally the decay curve for\nInSb itself ~again with the same density! has an initial life-\ntime of 500 ps. We can see that the lifetime for the 11 mm\nInNxSb12x alloy is only slightly shorter than that for 7 mm\nInSb in spite of its much smaller band gap. However, it is\nalmost as long as that of the 7 mm HgCdTe alloy, and much\nlonger than that of the 11 mm HgCdTe. These numerical\nresults are not dependent on any prior knowledge of the band\nstructure of the slightly exotic nitride alloy system, its Auger\ncoefficient, or the carrier density, though our conclusion is\nthat the effects observed are a consequence of the band struc-\nture. Similar suppression over the equivalent band gap\nHgCdTe was seen for the other alloys, e.g., the HgCdTe\nequivalent of the 10 K result of sample B is 21 ps ~cf. 130 ps\nmentioned earlier!.\nIn summary, we demonstrate alloys of InNxSb12x with\ntransmission edge wavelengths out to 15 mm at room tem-\nperature. We show that for a given quasi-Fermi level sepa-\nration the Auger recombination rate is about one third that of\nequivalent band gap HgCdTe, due to the higher electron\nmass and conduction band nonparabolicity. As a result of\nthis, all other things being equal, a 10 mm wavelength laser\nbased on InNxSb12x material would have an Auger current at\nthreshold less than an equivalent HgCdTe device, highlight-Downloaded 26 Feb 2008 to 131.227.178.92.
