Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; ionosphere-\nmagnetosphere interactions; plasma convection)\n1 Introduction\nA major goal of solar-terrestrial physics is to improve the\nunderstanding of the nature of the coupled magnetosphere-\nionosphere system. This is increasingly being achieved using\nsimultaneous ground- and space-based observations which\nare becoming ever more available. On the dayside, space-\ncraft observations of impulsive magnetopause reconnection,\nor flux transfer events (FTEs), have been linked to conse-\nquent flow and auroral features in the ionosphere (e.g. Lock-\nwood et al., 1989, 1993; Elphic et al., 1990; Pinnock et al.,\nCorrespondence to: A. Grocott\n(ag27@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1993, 1995; Moen et al., 1995; Provan et al., 1998; Neudegg\net al., 1999, 2000; Milan et al., 2000). Correspondingly on\nthe nightside, magnetospheric substorms have been studied\nto great depths in terms of their large-scale ramifications on\nthe magnetic tail and nightside ionosphere (e.g. Russell and\nMcPherron, 1973; Hones, 1979; Baker et al., 1996; Lui,\n1996; Opgenoorth and Pellinen, 1998; Grocott et al., 2000,\n2002). However, substorms are not the only mechanism by\nwhich the tail contributes to magnetosphere-ionosphere cou-\npling. For example, Huang et al. (2001) reported observa-\ntions of quasi-sinusoidal nightside flow oscillations in Su-\nperDARN radar data during an extended interval of modest\nnorthward IMF, which were associated with the formation\nof large-scale clockwise flow vortices in the post-midnight\nsector. The authors associate these flows with global os-\ncillations of an essentially closed tail. Walker et al. (1998,\n2002), on the other hand, have reported the occurrence\nof latitudinally-restricted (\u223c1\u25e6 north-south) bursts of high-\nspeed (\u223c2 km s\u22121) westward flow in the pre-midnight sec-\ntor under similar interplanetary conditions (weak IMF with\nsmall clock angle). Walker et al. interpreted the bursts as be-\ning due to sporadic energy release and field dipolarisation\nin the geomagnetic tail associated with a viscously-driven\ntwin-vortex flow system. Recently, Grocott et al. (2003)\nhave found intervals of northward IMF during which fast\n(\u223c1000 m s\u22121) flow bursts lasting a few tens of minutes are\nobserved in the nightside ionosphere. These bursts were not\naccompanied by any classic substorm phenomena, such as\nauroral enhancements, particle injections or magnetic bays,\nyet were shown to be associated with field reconfiguration\nafter reconnection in the tail.\nOne further class of phenomena, which have been ob-\nserved during all phases of the substorm cycle, are narrow\nchannels of fast flow in the central plasma sheet known as\nbursty bulk flows (BBFs) (Baumjohann et al., 1990; An-\ngelopoulos at al., 1992). These azimuthally-localised flows\nin the near-Earth plasma sheet have been associated with\nnumerous counterpart signatures in the ionosphere. De la\nBeaujardie`re et al. (1994) report the occurrence of bursts\n1062 A. Grocott et al.: Ionospheric observations of a bursty bulk flow\nof equatorward-directed flow in nightside Sondrestrom radar\ndata, which take place during a \u201cquiet-time\u201d interval in which\nthe transverse components of the IMF were small and di-\nrected mainly northward. These flow bursts were initiated\nnear the nightside open-closed field line boundary, had am-\nplitudes up to several 100 m s\u22121, and recurred at \u223c1 h in-\ntervals, lasting on each occasion for a few tens of minutes.\nSimultaneous auroral data show that each flow pulse was ac-\ncompanied by an activation of the poleward-most arc system,\nin which a new east-west aligned arc formed poleward of the\nexisting boundary, and subsequently moved equatorward, to-\ngether with existing precipitation structures. This behaviour\nstrongly suggests an origin in bursts of reconnection in the\n\u201cquiet-time\u201d tail. Poleward boundary auroral intensifications\n(PBIs) and arc \u201cbifurcations\u201d have subsequently been shown\nto occur commonly under a wide variety of conditions, both\nduring \u201cquiet\u201d times, and in the growth, expansion and recov-\nery phases of substorms (Lyons et al., 1999), often leading to\nthe ejection of one or more north-south aligned auroral forms\n(called \u201cauroral streamers\u201d) towards lower latitudes (Hender-\nson et al., 1998).\nOther examples of ionospheric flow excitation in connec-\ntion with BBFs have been reported, as well as associated rel-\natively weak structured magnetic disturbances and Pi2 sig-\nnals. Sergeev et al. (1990) discussed STARE radar obser-\nvations of fast (\u223c1000 m s\u22121) equatorward flows which co-\nincided with ISEE-1 and -2 spacecraft measurements of en-\nhanced central plasma sheet earthward convection. These ob-\nservations occurred during periods of prolonged, steady con-\nvection without any apparent classic substorm activity. The\nobserved features are, therefore, interpreted as the result of\nimpulsive reconnection enhancements in the distant tail. In\nanother study, Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr (1997) interpreted pulses\nof ionospheric flow seen in the CUTLASS radars as signa-\ntures of ionospheric current vortices associated with pairs of\nfield aligned currents. Yeoman et al. (1998) went on to relate\nthese effects to transient features in Geotail field and plasma\ndata which are suggested to be produced by BBFs. More re-\ncently, Kauristie et al. (2000) have conducted a superposed\nepoch analysis of Wind satellite plasma data and ionospheric\nconjugate magnetic field observations. This study provides\nevidence for an association between transient plasma sheet\nflows and vortex-like ground magnetic field variations.\nA review of current understanding of these various related\nphenomena is given by Amm and Kauristie (2002). One ma-\njor question they pose concerns the difference between sub-\nstorm and non-substorm events, and this will be discussed\nfurther below. They also point out, however, that many of\nthe observed ionospheric effects can be shielded or greatly\nobscured during substorm expansions, by the inherent large-\nscale electrodynamics. In the present study, we investigate\nthe ionospheric counterpart of a BBF which occurred dur-\ning a substorm growth phase, thus largely circumventing any\nsuch effects. Excellent ground-based data are available for\nthe event, which occurred on 7 September 2001, allowing\nflow, geomagnetic field, and auroral phenomena to be exam-\nined. The Cluster spacecraft provide plasma and field data\nin the near-Earth plasma sheet, with conjugate ionospheric\nobservations being provided by the CUTLASS radars, the\nIMAGE and SAMNET magnetometers and the FUV auro-\nral imager on the IMAGE spacecraft (see Sect. 2 for details\nof this instrumentation). During the event, ground magnetic\nactivity was low (consistent with no substorm activity) with\nperturbations of magnitude\u223c30 nT being typically observed.\nNevertheless, significant ionospheric flow and auroral signa-\ntures were observed and these are considered below, along\nwith a discussion of potential driving mechanisms and their\nimplications for our understanding of substorm physics.\n2 Instrumentation\nAs discussed above, this study combines simultaneous mea-\nsurements from a number of sources to investigate the flow,\nmagnetic, and auroral signatures associated with a BBF\nevent on 7 September 2001. Ionospheric convection ve-\nlocities are provided primarily by the Pykkvib\u00e6r radar of\nthe Cooperative UK Twin-Located Auroral Sounding Sys-\ntem (CUTLASS). CUTLASS forms part of the Super Dual\nAuroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), an international ar-\nray of HF coherent radars spanning the auroral regions of\nboth the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (Greenwald et\nal., 1995). Data from the entire northern hemisphere Super-\nDARN network, which consisted of eight radars during the\ninterval being studied, is also used to provide a global so-\nlution to the ionospheric electric potential, and hence, the\nglobal convection pattern. This is achieved using the Map\nPotential Model (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998) which fits\nthe line-of-sight SuperDARN data to an 8th order expan-\nsion (in this case) of the electrostatic potential in spherical\nharmonics. Information from the statistical model of Ruo-\nhoniemi and Greenwald (1996), parameterised by IMF con-\nditions, is used to stabilise the solution in regions where no\nmeasurements are available. During the study interval, all\neight radars were operating in a standard mode, in which\neach radar scans through 16 beams of azimuthal separation\n3.24\u25e6, with a total scan time of 2 min. Each beam is divided\ninto 75 range gates of length 45 km, and so in each full scan\nthe radar covers 52\u25e6 in azimuth and over 3000 km in range,\nan area of over 4\u00d7106 km2.\nThe fields-of-view of the CUTLASS radar pair are illus-\ntrated in the top panel of Fig. 1, which shows a geographic\nprojection from the pole to \u223c60\u25e6 latitude and from \u221290\u25e6\nthrough to 90\u25e6 longitude. Beam 10 of the CUTLASS Ice-\nland radar is indicated by the dashed line. Also shown on the\nfigure are the locations of four magnetometers from the Inter-\nnational Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE)\narray (Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998) (JAN, BJN, NAL, and KIR), and one\nfrom the Sub-Auroral Magnetometer Network (SAMNET)\n(Yeoman et al., 1990) (HLL). The solid black curves on the\nfigure represent the footprint of the Cluster (1) spacecraft be-\ntween 22:00 and 00:00 UT, mapped into the ionosphere us-\ning the T-96 magnetic field model (Tsyganenko, 1995), with\nBZ=+2 (upper curve) andBZ=\u22125 (lower curve).

The solid black curves represent the footprint of the Cluster (1) spacecraft between 22:00 and 00:00 UT,\nmapped into the ionosphere using the T-96 magnetic field model with BZ=+2 (upper curve) and BZ=\u22125 (lower curve). The bottom two\npanels show the Cluster field lines at 22:00 UT (upper field line in both panels) and 23:00 UT in the X\u2212Y and X\u2212Z GSE planes. Indicated\nby the dashed and dot-dashed curves are a nominal magnetopause and bow shock, respectively.\ncurves give an indication of the uncertainty in the mapped lo-\ncation of the Cluster footprint given the variation in IMF ori-\nentation over the interval (see below). The bottom two panels\nof Fig. 1 show the Cluster field lines at 22:00 UT (upper field\nline in both panels) and at 23:00 UT (lower field line) in the\nX\u2212Y and X\u2212Z GSE planes. Indicated on these panels by\nthe dashed and dot-dashed curves is a nominal magnetopause\nand bow shock, respectively. At the time of the BBF event\nstudied here, the Cluster spacecraft were located at approxi-\nmately (X, Y,Z)GSE=(\u221220, 0, 0) RE (the spacecraft separa-\ntion was of the order of \u223c2000 km, discussed in more detail\nbelow). The Composition and Distribution Function Ana-\nlyzer (CODIF) sensor of the Cluster Ion Spectrometry (CIS)\ninstrument (Re`me et al., 2001) provides ion velocity data for\nthe event, and magnetic data is provided by the fluxgate mag-\nnetometer (FGM) (Balogh et al., 2001), presented here in\nGSM coordinates.\nData from two further spacecraft have been used in this\nstudy. First, the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)\nspacecraft (Stone et al., 1998), located upstream of the\nEarth at GSM coordinates (X, Y, Z)=(230,\u221237, 11) RE ,\nprovided interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) data from the\n1064 A.

This instrument viewed the\nwhole of the northern polar ionosphere during the course of\nthe interval, and provided images approximately every 2 min.\nThese consist of 5-s integrations of UV photons at a wave-\nlength of 135.6 nm.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Upstream interplanetary magnetic field observations\nFigure 2 presents data from the ACE spacecraft magne-\ntometer instrument in GSM coordinates for the interval\n22:00\u201323:00 UT on 7 September 2001. It should be noted\nthat the propagation delay of field changes from ACE to\nthe dayside ionosphere, estimated following the method of\nKhan and Cowley (1999) to be 73\u00b12 min (using a value of\nVSW\u223c367\u00b110 km s\u22121), has been used to lag the data dis-\nplayed here. The grey shaded portion of this figure repre-\nsents the interval 22:26\u201322:36 UT, corresponding to the in-\nterval of Cluster data shown in Fig. 3, discussed in the next\nsection. The vertical dashed line at 22:29 UT indicates the\ntime of a BBF event identified in the Cluster data. The top\npanel shows the BX component of the magnetic field, which\nremained relatively steady between about\u22121 and\u22123 nT dur-\ning the entire interval. The middle panel shows the BY com-\nponent, which shows a fairly sudden increase from \u223c\u2212 4 nT\nbefore the BBF to \u223c\u22122 nT after. The bottom panel shows\nthe BZ component. This dropped suddenly from \u223c+2 nT to\n\u223c\u22125 nT at\u223c22:16 UT, and then briefly increased to\u223c\u22122 nT\nat \u223c22:27 UT, before dropping back down to \u223c\u22126 nT at the\ntime of the BBF where it remained for the rest of the interval.\nIt is the change from a northward to a southward IMF orienta-\ntion that would eventually give rise to the equatorward shift\nin the mapped location of the Cluster footprint (mentioned\nabove). However, the actual change in footprint location be-\ntween 22:16 UT and the time of the BBF just 10\u201315 min later\nA.

Data are shown\nfor the Cluster 1 spacecraft (black), Cluster 3 (green) and\nCluster 4 (magenta) (the CIS instrument on Cluster 2 failed\nand so data from this spacecraft are not discussed). During\nthe interval the four spacecraft formed an inverted tetrahe-\ndron with Cluster 1, 2, and 4 in approximately the same\nX\u2212Y plane, and Cluster 3 about 2000 km lower in Z. In\nthe top panel of Fig. 3 GSM X-component velocity data\n(VX) reveal a large (\u223c600 km s\u22121) earthward flow signa-\nture during the interval 22:28\u201322:35 UT. The second panel\nshows the component of this flow which is perpendicular\nto the magnetic field (VX\u22a5). These data reveal perpendic-\nular flows of \u223c200\u2212 400 km s\u22121, which are enhanced above\nthe Baumjohann et al. (1989) average convection velocity\n(Vc(AE)<100 km s\u22121 for AE<200 nT) by a few times. It\nis this signature, and the accompanying small (\u223c10 nT) en-\nhancement in BZ (bottom panel), which are evidence of field\ndipolarisation and the earthward transport of flux and hence,\nthe occurrence of a BBF (Angelopoulos et al., 1992). Naka-\nmura et al. (2001) report a peak flux transport rate of the\norder of 2 mV m\u22121 for BBFs, which is also consistent with\nfield-perpendicular flows of this magnitude. For our pur-\nposes, these data have been used to identify the BBF and\nestimate an \u201conset\u201d time of 22:29 UT, which is indicated on\nthis and other plots by the vertical dashed line. It should\nbe noted that the earthward flow seen in VX\u22a5 is still present\nwhen Cluster 1 and 4 re-enter the central plasma sheet at\n\u223c22:33 UT (evidenced by the decrease in (negative)BX back\nto near zero (third panel)). The flows persist, albeit some-\nwhat less intensely, until \u223c22:35 UT, after which time they\ndie away.\n3.3 Ground-based and auroral observations\nThis section looks closely at the ground magnetic, iono-\nspheric flow, and auroral data during the hour surrounding\nthe identification of the BBF at Cluster.

The vertical\ndashed line and grey shaded area are as in Fig. 2, and the scale of the curves is shown on the left-hand side of the figure. The bottom curves\nshow Pi2 filtered data (20\u2013200 s) from the JAN magnetometer, and have a separate scale as indicated. Station identifier codes and their\nlocations are indicated on the right-hand side.\nareX- Y - andZ-component magnetometer data from the five\nstations indicated in Fig. 1, for the interval 22:00\u201323:00 UT.\nThe vertical dashed line and grey shaded area are as in Fig. 2,\nand the scale of the curves is shown on the left-hand side\nof the figure. The bottom curves show Pi2 filtered data\n(20\u2013200 s) from the JAN magnetometer, and have a sepa-\nrate scale as indicated. Looking first at these filtered data,\nthere is a small amplitude Pi2 pulsation nearly coincident\nwith the flow enhancement seen at Cluster. The Pi2 is most\nprominent in the X-component (amplitude \u223c8 nT), weaker\nin the Y -component and non-evident in the Z-component.\nIts \u201conset\u201d is a few minutes before Cluster observed the BBF\nproper, although there are small amplitude flows and mag-\nnetic perturbations in the Cluster data (see Fig. 3) which be-\ngin at \u223c22:27 UT, coincident with the Pi2.\nLooking at the unfiltered data, the most obvious charac-\nteristic to note is the small scale of the perturbations ob-\nserved during the BBF interval. The largest disturbance over\nthe hour of interest, seen in the Z-component by NAL, is\n\u223c60 nT, with typical values <30 nT. The JAN magnetome-\nter sees the most prominent signature during the BBF itself,\nand is also the station closest to the mapped location of the\nCluster footprint (Fig. 1). This feature at \u223c22:30 UT, which\nconsists of a double peak in the X-component and a single\npeak in the Y -component, both of amplitude \u223c10 nT, is also\nevident on a much smaller scale in the data from the other\nfour magnetometers. In the Z-component at JAN we also\nsee a \u223c30 nT increase over the \u223c10 min of the event. HLL\n(to the west of JAN) also sees a small increase, whereas the\nmore eastern stations see a decrease. It is worth noting that at\n\u223c23:20 UT a substorm onset is apparent in the magnetometer\nand auroral data (not shown). This corroborates our classi-\nfication of this event as being in a substorm growth phase,\nand is consistent with the southward turn of the IMF approx-\nimately 1 h previously.\nThe CUTLASS data is introduced in Fig. 5, which shows\nvelocity measurements from beam 10 of the Iceland East\nradar (marked as a dashed line in Fig. 1), along with\nX-component data from the HLL, JAN, and BJN magne-\ntometers. The top panel shows range-time-velocity flow data\nfrom beam 10 of the radar for the interval 22:00\u201323:00 UT.\nThe colour scale is defined on the right-hand side of the fig-\nure, with green-blue indicating flows towards the radar (pos-\nitive velocities) and yellow-red indicating flows away (neg-\native velocities). Before 22:29 UT, the radar sees relatively\nlow velocities of a few \u223c100 m s\u22121 (green and yellow). Af-\nter this time, apparently coincident with the \u201conset\u201d time\nof the BBF, the flows developed rapidly, reaching velocities\nof 500\u20131000 m s\u22121. In fact, as suggested above, the BBF\nis likely to have commenced some minutes earlier, perhaps\nnot being detected until \u223c22:29 UT, owing to the location\nof the Cluster spacecraft. Such timing issues, however, can-\nnot be resolved with the data available during this interval\nand would be better addressed during events occurring when\nthe Cluster spacecraft separation was much larger. After the\nmain flow burst, CUTLASS observed further enhancements,\nor changes in the flow, at \u223c22:43 and \u223c22:49 UT. These\nalso correspond to small (<100 km s\u22121) enhancements in the\nA.

Range-time-velocity measurements from beam 10 of the Iceland East radar (top panel), a velocity-time profile from range 20 of beam\n10 (second panel) andX-component data from the HLL, JAN, and BJN magnetometers (bottom three panels) for the interval 22:00\u201323:00 UT.\nThe vertical dashed line and grey shaded area are as in Fig. 2.\nCluster flow data (not shown), although as isolated signatures\nthey would not constitute additional BBF activity according\nto the criteria of Angelopoulos et al. (1992). Finally, note that\nthe flows observed by CUTLASS after 22:29 UT are directed\nboth away from the radar (red) and towards the radar (blue).\nThe boundary between the two indicates a flow reversal and\nis therefore potentially a proxy for the open-closed field line\nboundary. This boundary appears to move away from the\nradar (i.e. with a poleward component) up until \u223c22:36 UT,\nand then begins to return to nearer ranges. This is considered\nfurther in Sect. 4.2, below.\nThe ionospheric velocity variations discussed above are\ndepicted more quantitatively in the second panel of Fig. 5,\nwhich shows a velocity-time profile from range 20 of beam\n10. This range gate highlights the large (>1000 m s\u22121) vari-\nations and is located close to the location of the JAN mag-\nnetometer. Comparing the flow data (which has a consider-\nable east-west component) to the X-component of the HLL,\nJAN, and BJN magnetometer data (shown in the bottom three\npanels) suggests some possible correlation between the two\nthroughout the interval.\n1068 A.

Grocott et al.: Ionospheric observations of a bursty bulk flow\nIf the magnetic perturbations are due to overhead Hall cur-\nrents, then they should correlate with the flow variations ac-\ncording to 1X\u221d6HVW , where 1X is the northward com-\nponent of the magnetic perturbation, VW is the westward\ncomponent of the flow, and 6H is the height-integrated iono-\nspheric Hall conductivity. If we take values of \u223c1000 m s\u22121\nfor the flow speed, and magnetic perturbations of \u223c10 nT,\nthen the implied value of 6H is small, of the order of 0.1 S.\nThis is likely to have contributed to the relatively unperturbed\nnature of the ionospheric flow pattern, whereas regions of\nhigh conductivity (e.g. during the substorm expansion phase\nonset) can often result in flow diversion and suppression (e.g.\nYeoman et al., 2000). It may also explain their being no\ndropout of ionospheric backscatter observed by CUTLASS,\nsince regions of high conductivity are often associated with\nprecipitation-induced D-region radio absorption (Milan et\nal., 1996).\nTo better visualise the flow data, 2-D maps of the\nCUTLASS Iceland flow data (top panels) and the IMAGE\nUV auroral data (bottom panels), over the interval 22:24\u2013\n22:46 UT are presented in Fig. 6. Each map pair represents\na 2-min interval (shown at the top of each column) and ev-\nery other 2-min interval is shown (the exact time of each UV\nimage is shown above each panel). Also shown on the maps\nare flow vectors and equipotential contours derived using the\nMap Potential model as discussed in Sect. 2, the locations\nof the five magnetometers used, and the Cluster footprint lo-\ncation (indicated by the unfilled black circle). At the bot-\ntom of each column the transpolar voltage, APL statistical\nmodel (Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996), vector scale and\nIMF vector for each interval are shown. The coordinates\nemployed in the maps are Altitude Adjusted Corrected Geo-\nmagnetic (AACGM) latitude and magnetic local time (MLT),\nbased on the PACE coordinate system discussed by Baker\nand Wing (1989), with midnight at the bottom of each panel.\nIn Fig. 6a (22:24\u201322:26 UT), immediately before the on-\nset of the BBF, we see a moderate convection pattern with\na transpolar voltage of 41 kV (compared to 57 kV in the sta-\ntistical model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996). This\nis fairly typical of the interval up until this point after the\nIMF turned southward at \u223c22:16 UT (lagged time). Some\nlocalised enhancement to the flow towards the radar is evi-\ndent in the vicinity of the JAN magnetometer just poleward\nof a slight enhancement in auroral emissions. Figure 6b\n(22:28\u201322:30 UT) shows the situation at the time of BBF\n\u201conset\u201d. In the flow data a noticeable change has occurred\nwith fast (\u223c1000 m s\u22121) flows away from the radar now ap-\nparent just pre-midnight. This appears to have had the effect\nof \u201cdrawing\u201d the nightside tip of the dusk convection cell to-\nwards dawn. There is a negligible change to the transpolar\nvoltage, implying that the flow enhancements observed are\na localised reconfiguration and not an increase in the flux\nthroughput of the system. In the optical data, just equator-\nward of these fast flows is an enhanced \u201cblob\u201d of auroral\nemission peaking at an intensity of\u223c1 kR. In Fig. 6c (22:32\u2013\n22:34 UT) the pre-midnight flows have developed further\ninto an \u201cS\u201d shape with the aurora located in the velocity\nshear from east to west flows (and hence, corresponding to\nupward field-aligned current). The transpolar voltage has\nalso become noticeably enhanced to 49 kV, and the \u201cblob\u201d\nof aurora has also grown in size, expanding towards dusk. In\nFig. 6d (22:36\u201322:38 UT) the flows remain much the same.\nThe transpolar voltage has increased further still to 59 kV,\nwhile the auroral enhancements have decreased somewhat,\npeaking now at a modest \u223c700 R. Figures 6e\u2013f show these\nenhanced flows and moderate aurora to persist and remain at\na relatively constant level over the following 10 min. The en-\nhanced flows then continue for the\u223c30-min remainder of the\nsubstorm growth phase, before onset at \u223c23:20 UT as men-\ntioned above.\nIt is worth commenting on the sensitivity of the \u201cMap\nPotential\u201d transpolar voltage estimates (discussed above) to\nthe statistical flow model employed (mentioned previously in\nSect. 2). For this interval, the ratio of the number of actual\ndata points to the number of statistical data points used in the\nmodel is approximately constant, with \u223c400\u00b140 actual data\npoints, and\u223c540 statistical data points. This consistency im-\nplies that variations in the voltage estimates over the interval\nwill not be caused by variations in the influence of the sta-\ntistical model. It is possible, however, that changes in the\nvoltage may occur due to changes in which statistical model\nis being used at any one time. In this case, a quantitative anal-\nysis of the Map Potential results (discussed in more detail in\nSect. 4.2, below) shows that whilst the statistical model does\nhave some influence over the outcome, it does not dominate\nthe result over the data.\n4 Discussion\nThe importance of bursty bulk flows as a mechanism for the\nearthward transport of flux from the tail is now relatively well\naccepted. Early studies, such as that of Eastman et al. (1985),\nsuggested that the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) is\nthe primary mass transport region. In that case, the flows\nhave a large field-aligned component and are therefore not\ngenerally associated with convective transport. Baumjohann\net al. (1990) showed that the occurrence rate of high-speed\nflows in the PSBL is only about twice that of the central\nplasma sheet (CPS). Taking into account that the ion density\nin the CPS is about three times greater than in the PSBL, they\nsuggested that the CPS may in fact be the primary region for\nhigh-speed mass transport. Here, or more specifically, in the\ninner central plasma sheet (ICPS) the flows have a large field-\nperpendicular component and therefore represent cross-field\ntransport. Angelopoulos et al. (1992) studied these ICPS\nflows in detail and found that the high-speed bursts are em-\nbedded in longer, 10-min time scale enhanced velocity struc-\ntures. It is these structures which they termed \u201cbursty bulk\nflows\u201d to indicate that, in contrast to boundary layer flows,\nthey represent a bulk and usually convective flow of a single\npopulation.\nThe present study has provided simultaneous magneto-\nspheric and ionospheric observations of a BBF-type event\nA. Grocott et al.: Ionospheric observations of a bursty bulk flow 1071\nin the near-Earth ICPS. Its occurrence during relatively quiet\nbackground geomagnetic conditions has facilitated the inves-\ntigation of associated flow and magnetic signatures in the\nionosphere. The transient enhancement to the flow seen in\nthe midnight sector by the CUTLASS Iceland radar is con-\nsistent with the notion of a BBF being a burst of convective\ntransport in the tail. As mentioned above, Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr\n(1997), Yeoman et al. (1998), and Wild and Yeoman (2000)\nhave previously reported similar observations of transient\nflow features seen by CUTLASS, which they also suggested\nmay be associated with BBF activity in the tail. These fea-\ntures had radar line-of-sight velocities of \u223c500\u20131000 m s\u22121\nand spatial extents of a few \u223c100 km, comparative to the\nevent studied here. However, in these cases a significant\nazimuthal propagation was also observed, in some cases as\nlarge as 6 km s\u22121, which was not detected in the present\nstudy. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that\nthese earlier observations were made during substorm expan-\nsions and at local times displaced from midnight. Some onset\ntheories (such as that of Shiokawa et al. (1997)) require the\nbreaking and azimuthal redirection of the earthward plasma\nsheet flow, a phenomenon which has been reported by Yeo-\nman et al. (1998) and Nakamura et al. (1999). Although there\nis no direct evidence of this in the present study, uncertainties\nin mapping ionospheric observations into the tail complicate\nthe identification of conjugate signatures. A small area in the\nionosphere maps to a large region of tail, such that the main\nregion of flow excitation in the CUTLASS field-of-view may\nwell map to a location considerably earthward of the Cluster\nspacecraft. Future work will endeavour to integrate these dif-\nferent observations into a simple conceptual framework us-\ning more multi-instrument observations over more local time\nsectors and throughout the substorm cycle.\n4.1 Field-aligned current analysis\nIt was mentioned previously that the observations of Yeoman\nand Lu\u00a8hr (1997) and Wild and Yeoman (2000) were inter-\npreted as the signatures of ionospheric Hall current vortices\nassociated with field-aligned currents (FAC). In an attempt to\nvisualise the pattern of FAC during this event, the curl of the\nvelocity field (derived from the electric potential) has been\ndetermined for the interval of maximum auroral disturbance\nat 22:32 UT, using the technique described by McWilliams\net al. (2001). This is shown alongside the corresponding\nauroral map in Fig. 7, with positive vorticities (red\/yellow)\nindicating upward field-aligned current, and negative vortic-\nities (blue) downward field-aligned current. As expected, the\nregion of high intensity emission in the pre-midnight auro-\nral zone corresponds to an upward field-aligned current as-\nsociated with downward precipitating electrons. Poleward\nof this and slightly later in magnetic local time is a region\nof downward field-aligned current. These two regions must\npresumably be connected via ionospheric Pedersen currents,\nforming a current system not dissimilar to a typical substorm\ncurrent wedge. However, the apparently low Hall conductivi-\nties involved (evidenced by the small magnetic perturbations\nin the presence of large flows) suggest that there is no signif-\nicant Hall current component which would otherwise flow\nin conjunction with this Pedersen current (Cowley, 2000),\nhence, also explaining the lack of a typical substorm elec-\ntrojet signature in the magnetometer data. In this case, the\nPedersen current must therefore also be relatively small in\ncomparison to that observed in a typical substorm electrojet.\nUsing the results presented in Fig. 7, it is possible to make\na rough determination of the total amount of current flow-\ning in this BBF current \u201cwedgelet\u201d. The results imply that\nduring the interval of maximum auroral disturbance, there is\nan upward field-aligned current density of\u223c0.1\u00b5A m\u22122 S\u22121\nflowing over a relatively limited region of \u223c3\u00d7105 km2. As-\nsuming a non-substorm Pedersen conductivity of just a few\nS puts an upper limit on the amount of FAC of \u223c0.1 MA.\nA study by Akasofu and Kamide (1976) found that, for an\nauroral oval at 22\u25e6 co-latitude (as is approximately the case\nin the present study) under conditions of IMF Bz<\u22123 nT,\nthe total current in the substorm electrojet is of the order of\n1 MA, a factor of 10 greater than that suggested for the BBF.\nA likely explanation for this difference may lie in the size of\nthe auroral disturbance, usually observed to be much larger\nduring substorms, such that similar current densities will in-\nvolve much larger currents overall. Also, as discussed above,\nthe large Hall conductivities associated with substorms con-\ntribute a significant Hall component to the current in the elec-\ntrojet and thus, may play a part in enhancing the current. Ei-\nther way, this result implies that a \u201clone\u201d BBF amounts to\nonly a fraction of a substorm, with some further conditions\nbeing required to initiate a fully fledged expansion phase.\n4.2 Evidence for reconnection\nIf, although not necessarily associated with fully developed\nsubstorms, BBFs do result from intervals of tail reconnec-\ntion, then there should be measurable evidence of it. It was\nnoted with reference to Fig. 5 above, that a flow reversal\nboundary in the CUTLASS data moves poleward during the\nBBF and equatorward after it. If the flow reversal boundary\nis representative of the open-closed field line boundary, then\nthis would suggest that the BBF was accompanied by an in-\nterval of flux closure and hence, tail reconnection. This idea\nis corroborated by an analysis of the transpolar voltage be-\nlow. The fact that the BBF takes place during a substorm\ngrowth phase also then explains the apparent return to an\nequatorward motion of the boundary after the event, which\nis the expected motion during intervals of dayside loading.\nData from the CUTLASS Finland radar (not shown) were in-\nspected for further evidence of growth phase behaviour. With\nmore meridionally pointing beams than the Iceland radar, it\nis more suitable for investigating the equatorward motion of\nauroral zone scatter associated with an expanding polar cap\n(Lewis et al., 1997). There is some evidence of equatorward\nmotion in the data between the time of the BBF and the on-\nset of the substorm (\u223c22:30\u201323:20 UT), consistent with what\nwas inferred from the Iceland data. However, there is nothing\n1072 A.

IMAGE UV auroral data for the interval 22:32\u201322:34 UT in the same format as the maps in Fig. 6 (left-hand panel), and patterns\nof field-aligned currents for the same interval (right-hand panel). The field-aligned current has been estimated using the curl of the velocity\nfield (derived from the electric potential), with positive vorticities indicating upward field-aligned current, and negative vorticities downward\nfield-aligned current. Intensity and vorticity colour scales are indicated at the bottom of the figure.\nconclusive in the scatter during the BBF concerning the na-\nture of any boundary motion.\nThe main evidence for reconnection then is the enhance-\nment in the transpolar voltage which occurs at the time of the\nBBF onset. Before the BBF, as noted above, we see voltage\nvalues slightly lower than the steady-state statistical values\nof Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996). The\u223c20 kV increase\nobserved at the time of the BBF then implies an increase in\nflux throughput as a result of reconnection enhancements in\nthe tail. It is relevant to note, however, that the BBF also co-\nincides with a reorientation of the IMF to a more southward\ndirection. This might itself explain the change in voltage, if it\nresulted in an increase in the reconnection rate at the dayside.\nFurther investigation of the flow data, however, reveals that\nthe enhancement is likely to have been due to a combination\nof both. Performing the Map Potential analysis with the data\nfrom the CUTLASS radars (in which the enhanced night-\nside flows were observed) omitted results in only a \u223c10 kV\nenhancement to the transpolar voltage, likely due to the in-\ncrease in the southward component of the IMF, as suggested\nabove. Performing the analysis with all the radar data in-\ncluded, but with the IMF fixed at the initial southward level,\nalso results in a \u223c10 kV increase in the voltage. This sug-\ngests that both enhanced dayside driving and tail reconnec-\ntion are contributing to the overall voltage increase observed.\nWhen compared to typical expansion phase associated volt-\nage increases, Grocott et al. (2002), for example, reported\nabout 40 kV. This result corroborates the above suggestion\nthat whilst similar to a substorm, a BBF is a significantly\nsmaller scale phenomenon.\n4.3 Relationship to the substorm cycle\nIt was mentioned above that BBFs are often classified in\nterms of substorm and non-substorm events, although there\nremains some ambiguity as to what exactly this distinction\nimplies. As suggested by Amm and Kauristie (2002), BBFs\nwhich occur during substorm expansive phases can differ\ngreatly in their phenomenology from non-substorm events\n(compare, for example, the present study with the studies of\nYeoman and Lu\u00a8hr (1997), Yeoman et al. (1998), and Wild\nand Yeoman (2000), discussed above). However, they use\nthe term \u201cnon-substorm\u201d to classify all events which do not\noccur during a substorm expansion, irrespective of the back-\nground conditions, although they stress that this is a tentative\ndefinition. This categorisation makes no distinction between\nso-called \u201cquiet\u201d intervals, where, for example, there is no\nevidence of the substorm cycle, and intervals of magneto-\nspheric loading such as substorm growth phases. As sug-\ngested recently by Grocott et al. (2003) there also exist sup-\nposedly \u201cquiet\u201d intervals of positive IMF Bz during which\nfast flows are observed in the nightside ionosphere which\nare apparently related to reconnection in the tail and modest\nloading from the dayside, yet are not accompanied by any\ninjection or auroral signatures. Therefore, these bursts also\ndiffer phenomenologically to the BBF event discussed in this\npaper which occurred during a substorm growth phase. Nev-\nertheless, at a fundamental level they must be manifestations\nof the same physical processes: reconnection, the closing of\nopen flux and the convective transport of that flux earthward,\naway from the reconnection region.\nA. Grocott et al.: Ionospheric observations of a bursty bulk flow 1073\n5 Summary\nOn 7 September 2001 the Cluster spacecraft observed evi-\ndence of a bursty bulk flow in the near-Earth central plasma\nsheet at a distance of \u223c20RE downtail. Upstream interplan-\netary magnetic field data from the ACE spacecraft showed\nthis to be an interval of southward field, consistent with one\nof active convection in the magnetosphere. This is con-\nfirmed by CUTLASS radar observations of plasma convec-\ntion in the nightside ionosphere, in which \u223c1000 m s\u22121 flow\nperturbations are seen in conjunction with the BBF. Optical\nmeasurements show enhanced auroral emissions from the re-\ngion magnetically conjugate to the BBF, indicative of elec-\ntron precipitation, yet ground magnetic records show only\nvery small amplitude perturbations, implying very low levels\nof ionospheric Hall conductivity. An analysis of the pattern\nof field-aligned currents implied by the flow data indicates\na substorm current wedge-type system. This ipoints to the\noccurrence of localised field dipolarisation and current dis-\nruption in the tail, but on a scale not sufficient to involve\na large-scale substorm expansion. Nevertheless, this event\ndoes appear to involve tail reconnection and flux closure, as\nevidenced in the auroral and flow data. Clearly, the simplistic\nconcept of substorm cycle vs. quiet times is not sufficient to\nfully explain the variety of mechanisms by which the mag-\nnetotail responds to varying levels of dayside loading. In-\nvestigation of similarly well observed events under differing\nconditions will hopefully provide further enlightenment on\nthis ever evolving field of research.\nAcknowledgements.
