To these can be \nadded \u2018extra-linguistic\u2019 motivations, which Farrar and Jones (2002: 1) define as \n\u2018sociopolitical and economic\u2019, but under which we would include social-psychological \nfactors, especially identities and attitudes. In this article, we use data on an English vowel \nshift, collected using established social dialectological methods, to explore whether the shift \nis internally motivated by general principles of vowel change, or whether other factors, \nparticularly dialect contact, play a more decisive role in guiding the progress of the shift.  \nMilroy (2002: 4) criticises early work in social dialectology for dealing with \u2018intra-\nvarietal\u2019 variation within a rather narrowly defined speech community composed of \u2018natives\u2019, \npointing out that speakers have a wider set of repertoires than such a model would predict. \nStudies focused relatively little on the speakers\u2019 contact with members of other speech \ncommunities; indeed, in his book covering social factors in linguistic change, Labov (2001: \n20) admits as much, stating that he is not concerned with dialect contact, but with \u2018those \nchanges that emerge from within a linguistic system\u2019 \u2013 by which he clearly means not \n\u2018internal\u2019 change as conceptualised here, but social motivations generated within speech \ncommunities where dialect contact is not present. We must add that we find this position to \nbe a serious underestimation of the role of dialect contact in change, as will become clear in \nthis article. However, since the 1980s, at least in Europe, studies have increasingly \nconcentrated on dialect levelling, which can be defined as the reduction in the number of \nrealisations of linguistic units found in a defined area, usually through the loss of \ngeographically and demographically restricted, or \u2018marked\u2019, variants, and the closely related \nnotion of dialect convergence, by which two or more varieties becoming more alike through \nconvergent changes. These are both seen as the outcomes of various, mainly contact-based, \nscenarios. Studies have demonstrated the loss of highly localised varieties, concomitant with \nthe loss of close-knit, small-scale social networks. Replacing localised varieties we find \ndistinctiveness at a larger, regional level, characterised by levelled varieties (Thelander 1982; \nTrudgill 1986:  98-102; Foulkes and Docherty eds. 1999; Kerswill 1994, 2002a; Hinskens \n1996; Kerswill and Williams 2000). We return to the change from local to regional \ndistinctiveness below. In practice, situations in which dialect levelling and dialect \nconvergence take place also give rise to entirely new forms, which in the case of vowels may \nbe phonetically intermediate between the older, more marked forms: this is what was found \nin a study of the New Town of Milton Keynes (Kerswill and Williams 2000). New, \nexogenous forms arriving from elsewhere by a process of geographical diffusion may also be \nfound (see below). When we compare two varieties within an area thought to be subject to \nlevelling, we see convergence through time; this was the case with a comparison of two \nsouth-east English towns, Reading and Milton Keynes (Williams and Kerswill 1999). Not \nonly is there convergence, but the varieties can also be seen to adopt common innovations.  \nTrudgill (1986) sees dialect contact as causing levelling through the mechanism of \nshort- and long-term accommodation by speakers in a contact situation. He has expanded this \nidea by arguing that one can make predictions about a levelling outcome, especially in a \u2018new \ndialect\u2019 such as the English of New Zealand, in a mechanistic way simply with knowledge of \nthe proportions of speakers of particular dialects in the mix (Trudgill, Gordon, Lewis and \nMaclagan 2000; Trudgill 2001).  \nMore recently, there have been attempts to relate levelling (and its obverse, dialect \nmaintenance) to a greater range of social psychological motivations. Thus, moving beyond \n  4 \ncontact issues, Milroy (2002: 4) argues that language attitudes and language ideologies must \nalso be taken into account in a sociolinguistic account of variation, as well as cognitive \nconstraints on acquiring a second dialect. In this vein, Watt (2000, 2002) favours an extra-\nlinguistic (i.e. not necessarily contact-based) account and argues that, in dialect levelling, \nsocial and attitudinal factors take priority over systemic factors. His study of the Tyneside \n(Newcastle) vowel system shows phonetic variation in the vowels FACE and GOAT.1 Older, \nlocalised variants, such as !\"#$ and !%#$, are being supplanted by new variants common to a \nwider geographical area, in particular !&'$ for FACE and !('$ or a fronted variant, !)'$, for \nGOAT. Watt argues that the new variants reflect a local identity without the social stigma \nassociated with the traditional variants. Even though some speech styles still maintain the \nmarked variants to a certain degree, they are slowly disappearing from the sound system \nbecause of their social and geographical connotations. The levelled, but still clearly regional, \nvariety is then a result of this process. Kerswill (2002b, forthcoming a) confirms the view that \nthere is regional levelling through a study of the same vowels in the nearby city of Durham, \nand argues that regional identity is a factor in this levelling.  In a study of dialect maintenance \nand loss in a rural north-east Scottish community, Marshall (2001, forthcoming 2003) finds \nthat an attitudinal measure relating to orientation to the local community is a stronger \npredictor of dialect use in individuals than is a measure based on Milroy\u2019s social network \nscale (1980: 141-142). This means that contact, as encapsulated in this measure of a person\u2019s \nsocial network, is of much lesser importance than is a factor that is identity-based, in way that \nis related to Watt\u2019s account.  \nIt must be said, however, that an understanding of the balance of \u2018contact\u2019 versus \n\u2018identity\u2019 or \u2018attitudes\u2019 in explaining the diffusion of change is in its infancy. This is \nespecially true of the types of identification that lead to the levelling discussed by Watt and \nMarshall. Our best guess would be, based on Trudgill\u2019s work and Marshall\u2019s insight, that \ncontact predicts the macro-level linguistic changes over a period of time, whereas individual \nresponses are more governed by attitudinal and identity factors. \nWe turn to a question of definition and terminology. Kerswill (2002b) suggests that \nwhen the dialect levelling is observed over a relatively large geographical area such as the \nsouth-east of England, it should be referred to as regional dialect levelling. Britain (2002b: \n63) discusses a process that is probably identical with this: dialect supralocalisation (cf. \nMilroy, Milroy and Hartley 1994). This is the linguistic consequence of supralocalisation, \nwhich is a set of social developments resulting from migration (Kerswill forthcoming b), \nmobility, an expansion in the tertiary economy and labour-market flexibility, leading to larger \n\u2018functional zones\u2019 (Britain 2002b: 62). Dialect supralocalisation, or regional dialect levelling, \nis then the formation of levelled supralocal varieties, with few local differences within a \nregion, resulting from this wider social change. \nFrom the discussion thus far, it is apparent that regional dialect levelling involves:  \n \n(i)  geographical diffusion, a process which involves features spreading out from a \npopulous, economically and culturally dominant centre to the surrounding \nareas (Britain 2002a; Trudgill 1983); \n(ii)  levelling, which can now be defined more narrowly as the reduction of the \nnumber of variants following speaker accommodation through face-to-face \ninteraction \u2013 a definition focusing on the social psychological mechanism \nbehind the levelling outcome and resulting from contact. Levelling (as distinct \nfrom regional dialect levelling\/supralocalisation) is necessarily restricted to \nsmaller geographical areas, such as new towns or compact regions; \n  5 \n(iii)  Non-contact, extra-linguistic factors including identity, attitudes and ideology, \nleading to adoption of features speakers deem attractive, and the avoidance of \nfeatures which are unattractive. \n \nAs we shall argue shortly, natural principles of vowel shifting will often conflict with \nthe pressures of regional dialect levelling. The question then becomes: which wins out when \nthere is a conflict?  \n \nINTERNAL FACTORS \nLabov (1994) is perhaps the most detailed account yet published on internal, structural \nmotivations for vowel shifts. He covers shifts in a number of languages, particularly English, \nand several of these are reported by him to have taken place in British English. A more recent \nstudy focusing on systemic factors involved in vowel change has been carried out by Watson, \nMaclagan and Harrington (2000) on New Zealand English short vowels. They argue that the \nchanges are mainly due to overcrowding in the vowel space and the avoidance of \nmisperception between phonetically similar vowels. This change, they claim, began as an \ninnovation where KIT moved to a more central position and other front vowels followed on \nbehind, in a drag chain (2000: 63). As with the English Great Vowel Shift, this is seen as an \nintegrated chain shift, which does not require external explanation: no suggestions are made \nthat this shift might be due to a process involving dialect contact or levelling, or even issues \nof identity.  \nA problem for the analyst, however, is the assumption that chain-shifts are a directly \nobservable and unitary phenomenon. As Lass (1997:  38-39) points out, \u2018a chain is a second-\norder object, deduced from correspondences, not \u201cobserved\u201d\u2019. Following Lass, we can argue \nthat the chain shift idea is a metaphor for a process by which vowels move, pushing other \nvowels away, or creating gaps which are then filled. The shifts are not observed directly; they \nare deduced from the apparent-time data and are consequently theoretical constructs. Despite \nthese ontological arguments, vowels do change in a coordinated fashion. There can be little \ndoubt that functional reasons partly underlie the \u2018chain\u2019, and constitute a type of internal \nchange (Martinet 1955, discussed in McMahon 1994: 30). \nThere are, then, two possible approaches to the \u2018explanation\u2019 of a vowel shift: the idea \nof a chain shift as a \u2018natural\u2019 mechanism of phonetic change (notwithstanding the arguments \njust cited), and the idea that external and extra-linguistic factors, especially contact and \nattitudes, can override a natural shift. This article will address this issue by taking a specific \ncontext \u2013 the short vowels of the non-standard English of south-east England \u2013 and testing \nthese notions.  \n \nLABOV\u2019S PRINCIPLES OF VOWEL SHIFTING AS INTERNAL \nMOTIVATION \nLabov\u2019s Principles of Vowel Shifting (1994: 116) are an explicit framework for the \nsystematic exploration and comparison of chain shifts. A number of studies on English \nvarieties have been carried out, informed by these principles (though few, if any, non-\nanglophone studies have made reference to them). Labov combines these principles into four \nobservable \u2018patterns\u2019. He also divides English varieties into three \u2018dialects\u2019 according to their \nvowel shifting patterns (Labov 1991). We will see whether these insights are valid for our \ndata. \nLabov\u2019s three principles are as follows (1994: 116):  \n \nPRINCIPLE I \nIn chain shifts, long vowels rise \n  6 \nPRINCIPLE II \nIn chain shifts, short vowels fall \nPRINCIPLE IIA \nIn chain shifts, the nuclei of upgliding diphthongs fall \nPRINCIPLE III \nIn chain shifts, back vowels move to the front \n \nAs this study will deal with the short monophthongs, we will be dealing with Principles II \nand III. Labov divides ongoing changes into four \u2018patterns\u2019. Pattern 1 (Labov 1994: 123, 170) \ninvolves the raising of long vowels and the lowering of the onset of close long vowels to \nform rising diphthongs (e.g., [a!] and [a\"] from [u#] and [i#], respectively). Pattern 2 (1994: \n125, 177-201) is seen in the US Northern Cities Shift, and involves the fronting and raising of \nlong back vowels (including, for these purposes, the vowel of LOT) in an anti-clockwise \nmovement, and the lowering and centralisation or backing of short front vowels (Wolfram \nand Schilling-Estes 1998: 138). The change patterns most important for us, however, are \nPatterns 3 and 4. \nPattern 3 is a combination of Principles I and III and states that open vowels become \nmore close and back whilst back close and mid vowels become more front (1994: 201-208). \nLabov reports this type of shift in several varieties of English, calling it the Southern Shift. \nLabov cites the vowel system of Marie Colville, a \u2018Cockney\u2019 (vernacular London) speaker \ninterviewed in 1968, as evidence for this shifting pattern,. As we shall see, Labov\u2019s failure to \ncarry out a diachronic investigation of London vowels, either in real or apparent time, led him \nto some erroneous conclusions about the direction of any changes. Colville has a \u2018fronted\u2019 \nGOOSE vowel (following Principle III), with THOUGHT \u2018rising\u2019 to take its place. If we take \nLabov\u2019s word for the idea that Marie Colville\u2019s vowel system is a stage in a vowel shift, then \nthere is a tension at this point between Principles I and III, in that THOUGHT could be \npropelled either front or up: the latter is what happens in this case. It seems (to us) that the \nintegrity of Pattern 3 and the two principles can be preserved if we regard THOUGHT as an \nopen-mid vowel and therefore susceptible to raising. Further, Principle III predicts the \nfronting of (the onset of) GOAT and fronting of FOOT. Marie Colville, however, has a GOAT \nvowel that is not fronted, but has a mid onset, and no fronting of FOOT (Labov 1994: 169). \nGOAT fronting is, however, a pattern that can be seen in many varieties in England, having a \nfronted monophthongal (Watt and Tillotson 2001) or diphthongal (Kerswill and Williams \nforthcoming) realisation, regardless of the presence or otherwise of a vowel shift. There is no \nuniversal agreement about what is the driving force behind changes in the diphthong. \nStockwell and Minkova (1999: 90) argue that there is an intrinsic process of dissimilation \nbetween the elements of the diphthong and this is the dynamic behind the change. Wells \n(1982: 308-309) regards the movement as part of a wider process of diphthong shift. A \nfronted FOOT vowel has also been reported across several varieties in England; see e.g. \nTorgersen (1997), and below. Labov claims that the most extensive examples of fronting are \nfound in the phonology of Norwich, at least as compared to London and some US cities he \ndescribes. However, it is clear that Labov could not have noted the fronting that has been \nfound in the years since he conducted his (very limited) fieldwork in England in the 1960s. \nHe does note the fronting of GOOSE, for which there is much earlier evidence than for that of \nGOAT (Bauer 1985; Kerswill and Williams forthcoming). \nAccording to Labov (1994: 208-218), Pattern 4 is the most commonly observed \npattern in English varieties which, like those of south-east England, Australia, New Zealand \nand the American South, are said to be following the Southern Shift. It involves the \ndownward movement of the onsets of FLEECE and FACE to a more centralised position. In \naddition, short front vowels rise, apparently contradicting Principle II. This will happen when \n  7 \nthe short vowels can be regarded as peripheral, meaning that they are located at the periphery \nof the speakers\u2019 vowel space. Labov backs up the claim of peripherality by pointing to his \nfinding that the vowels of KIT, DRESS and TRAP have a higher F2 (second formant) than long \nvowels and diphthongs with a similar height (as measured by F1) (Labov 1994:  209-210). \nLabov then recasts Principles I and II in terms of tenseness\/laxness in place of length, and \nmaps this dimension onto peripherality. This leads to the following restatement of these two \nprinciples (1994: 176):  \n \nPRINCIPLE I \nIn chain shifts, tense nuclei rise along a peripheral track. \nPRINCIPLE II \nIn chain shifts, lax nuclei fall along a non-peripheral track. \n \nThe short vowels of KIT, DRESS and TRAP, now considered \u2018tense\u2019, will then rise along the \nperipheral track. A diachronic raising of these vowels is fully supported by recent \ninstrumental findings in New Zealand, where raising has been found to have occurred during \nthe 20th century, reflecting a post-settlement innovation (see Maclagan, Gordon and Lewis \n(1999), Watson, Maclagan and Harrington (2000) and Evans (1998)). As we shall see shortly, \nthere is no evidence for such raising in southern England \u2013 rather, the converse. \n  \nCOUNTEREVIDENCE FOR LABOV\u2019S VOWEL CHANGE PATTERNS: \nKIT, DRESS AND TRAP IN SOUTH-EAST ENGLAND \nCounterevidence for Pattern 4 short vowel changes is reported in a number of studies. Wells \n(1982: 305) states that, although the London monophthongs do not differ much from those \nfound in RP (Received Pronunciation), KIT may be somewhat central and TRAP may be \nslightly lowered. STRUT has a very wide distribution ranging from a fronted !*+$ to a quality \nlike that of cardinal vowel four ([a]). Closer realisations, however, of e.g. DRESS, are found in \nan environment preceding a voiced consonant. Wells (1982: 304) gives [e] as the vowel of \nDRESS, while, for Norwich, Trudgill (1999b: 127) gives [+].2 This does, at the very least, \nindicate variation within the south-east. Wells also reports lowering of DRESS in the north of \nEngland. Finally, he regards a close DRESS vowel as a feature of old fashioned speech in RP \nand Cockney (the usual label for working class Londoners and their speech) (1982: 128). \nNeither Wells nor Trudgill, then, provides any evidence of the raising of KIT, though Wells \nclaims a fairly close DRESS vowel for London, with no mention of lowering. \nTRAP may be lowered to an [a] quality in the West Country (south-west England). \nAlso, there is lengthening of !,$ in some TRAP words in the south-east area (Wells 1982: \n130). For TRAP, the current trend is towards an open monophthong [a] in England, as \nopposed to a closer quality in the US. Wells (1982: 129) even hypothesises that the \ndevelopment in England may be a reaction against the closer realisation of TRAP in Cockney. \nIn sum, there is no evidence of raising of the two highest vowels, and there is ample evidence \nof the lowering of TRAP. This seems to run counter to Labov\u2019s Pattern 4. \nBauer (1985, 1994) reports an instrumental study of the RP short vowels TRAP and \nSTRUT. There seems to be backing of TRAP (lowering of F2): \u2018the figures for \/,\/ show a \nretraction and possibly a lowering of this vowel over the century\u2019 (Bauer 1994: 117). For \nSTRUT, there seems to be little realisational change. According to Bauer, this was unexpected \nas contemporary descriptions of RP describe this as an open centralised front vowel. His data \nare not clear enough to draw any safe conclusions for this vowel (Bauer 1985). However, \nwhen both TRAP and STRUT are compared there seems to be a slight backing of both (Bauer \n1985). \n  8 \nTollfree (1999), likewise, provides no evidence of the raising of short vowels in South \nEast London English (spoken by working-class people in her sample). Indeed, she uses \ntranscriptions that suggest quite open realisations of both DRESS and TRAP amongst non-\nstandard speakers in the Greater London area. According to her, younger speakers have !+$ or \nan even more open !+-$ as their DRESS vowel \u2013 a much more open quality than Wells allows \nfor; we will see below that other authors have noted a relatively open quality for this vowel. \nTRAP has !,$ or !,'$ for all speakers \u2013 which puts it only just below DRESS, and slightly \nlower than the !+-$ reported for TRAP by Hughes and Trudgill (1996). To judge from \nTollfree\u2019s transcriptions, the DRESS and TRAP vowels seem to be occupying almost the same \nphonetic space. As we shall see shortly, for Tollfree, TRAP may also occupy the open-front \nregion. \n \nOTHER VOWELS IN SOUTH-EAST ENGLAND \nExcept for FOOT, the remaining short vowels are not closely implicated in Labov\u2019s patterns. \nSTRUT is of considerable interest, because it has been subject to variability and change over a \nlong period. As with other authors, Tollfree reports a relatively front STRUT vowel in the \nregion of !.$ or !*$; this is similar to Hughes and Trudgill\u2019s (1996) use of !,\/$ for London, \nand distinct from the [$] or [%+] which Tollfree gives for \u2018South East London Regional \nStandard\u2019. She does not specify how STRUT is kept distinct from TRAP in working class \nspeech: presumably speakers with an open TRAP vowel will have the more central of the two \nvariants she lists.  \nTrudgill (1986: 51, 1999b) reports an ongoing lowering and fronting of STRUT in East \nAnglia, the area stretching out from the north-east of London. Rural accents show a gradient \nrealisation from a back !0$ to an RP type !*$. Urban accents may have an even more fronted \nquality in the region of [a&-]. The degree of fronting is dependent on age and proximity to \nLondon. However, to judge from recent data gathered north-west of London, this process \nmay in fact have been reversed in the London area: in the New Town of Milton Keynes, \nKerswill and Williams (2000) found few London-style front realisations of STRUT. \nThe vowels of GOOSE and FOOT are covered by Pattern 3. In accord with this pattern, \nTorgersen (1997) found strong fronting of both vowels amongst the younger informants in a \nstudy of middle class south-eastern British speech. Similar results were reported for Milton \nKeynes by Kerswill and Williams (2000). More generally, they found a levelling of vowels in \nboth Milton Keynes and Reading, especially those of PRICE, MOUTH and PALM, in the \ndirection of qualities that did not have a strongly local affiliation and which were phonetically \nintermediate between local variants and those of RP (Williams and Kerswill 1999).  \nThe evidence so far presented suggests that the short front vowels in southern British English \nare lowering, not rising, as implied by Labov in his presentation of Pattern 4 (1994: 209-214). \nThere is evidence of the fronting of GOOSE, GOAT and FOOT vowels, and this supports \nPrinciple III. This is arguably a natural shift, motivated by the smaller auditory space \navailable for back vowels than for front vowels. For STRUT, however, the data are conflicting, \nas both fronting and backing have been reported. In addition, we notice that dialect levelling \nseems to be having an impact on the vowel systems. \n \nWHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR CHANGE? \nA problem we encounter when describing processes such as \u2018fronting\u2019 and \u2018raising\u2019 is that \nthese terms presuppose a diachronic process. In hypothesising that south-eastern British \nEnglish had closer realisations of KIT, DRESS and TRAP than are current now, we do in fact \nfind some support in southern-hemisphere English vowel systems. Trudgill (forthcoming) \n  9 \nargues that southern-hemisphere English has retained a conservative short vowel system with \nquite close front vowel realisations. Typically, this is noticed in DRESS and TRAP. Immigrants \nto Australia and New Zealand came mainly from the south-east of England and they would \nhave retained their close realisations of the short front vowels, preserved (with modifications) \nin those countries. Trudgill adduces evidence in support of this account from traditional \ndialects in East Anglia that have retained a close DRESS vowel. Trudgill also provides \nevidence for close realisations in the south-east by quoting Survey of English Dialects (SED) \nmaterial from around London (Orton and Tilling 1970), as well as Ellis (1889) and Wright \n(1905). Based on these vowel qualities, Trudgill argues that a chain shift involving the short \nfront vowels has taken place in the south-east. The shift is a drag chain which started with the \nlowering of TRAP. \nIndeed, descriptions of vowels in London have found variation, though the evidence \nfor the time-scale of any lowering is not clear. To remedy this, we now turn to some older \nempirical studies.  \nHurford (1967) studied phonetic variation in one East End (London) family. The \nthree-generation family members he studied were born in the period 1885 to 1953, and were \nall characterised as Cockney speakers. Hurford finds a classic London short vowel system. \nHe states that there is little variation amongst the speakers for the short vowels, even though \nhe records quite a phonetic range for many of them. KIT has mainly a realisation in the '\"( \narea, but he notes variation from ')( to '*(, as well as '+( (1967: 348). DRESS is typically in \nthe region of '*(, but some speakers have closer realisations (1967: 353) \u2013 though Beaken \n(1971: 150), working with a younger sample of speakers, argues that the lowering of the \nDRESS vowel is a feature of modern Cockney. TRAP has realisations from ',( and '*( to '-(, \nmajority realisations being '*(, '.( and '-(, indicating that the vowel is more often lowered \nthan raised. The vowel may also be retracted to '+( or '$( (1967: 362). Hurford notes that one \nof the young informants actually has closer realisations for KIT, DRESS and TRAP than the \nothers, thus contradicting Beaken\u2019s finding. It is interesting to note that the recordings were \nmade in the mid-sixties at approximately the same time as Labov\u2019s recordings in the area. It \nis tempting to posit a temporary raising of vowels amongst younger people in the London at \nthat time, though this is, perhaps, unlikely. \nFor STRUT, some of Hurford\u2019s speakers have a central '$(, though most have an open \ncentral variant '$\/( (Hurford uses the symbol [A] for this quality). Only one of the oldest \nspeakers had a front '-( (1967: 382), suggesting (it seems to us) that, at least in the capital, \nextreme STRUT fronting had been reversed by the middle of the 20th century. STRUT fronting \nprobably originated in London and spread out from there; as we shall see from our own data, \na fairly front STRUT can still be found elsewhere in the south-east. As we shall see, too, the \nreversal of STRUT fronting appears to be spreading outside London. \nFinally, for LOT and FOOT there is relatively little variation, the speakers having \nmostly '0( and '!(, respectively. However, for FOOT, variants such as '1( and '2( are \noccasionally found. It may be significant that one of the oldest informants, in fact the speaker \nwith the front '-( in STRUT, has exclusively '!( (Hurford 1967: 399); this suggests that FOOT \nfronting may have begun between the time of the oldest and youngest of Hurford\u2019s \ngenerations. \nOlder Cockney had (and to some extent still has) items belonging to different lexical sets \nfrom those used in RP and the standard written language, including \u2018git\u2019 for get, \u2018cimitery\u2019 \nfor cemetery, \u2018whan\u2019 for when and \u2018Fanchurche\u2019 for Fenchurch  (Matthews 1938: 169). \nMatthews also mentions \u2018sech\u2019 for such and \u2018jist\u2019 for just (1938: 171) . He transcribes cab as \n  10 \n'3,4( and ban as '4,5(, stating that this realisation is very close to the \u2018standard short e\u2019 \n(1938: 79). It is likely that he is referring to a lexical, not a realisational difference, since this \nwould otherwise yield a very close TRAP vowel and a phonetic overlap with DRESS \u2013 though, \nas we see below, we cannot exclude the latter possibility.  \n Beaken (1971: 192-193) writes that there may be some confusion between TRAP and \nSTRUT and that, in general, there is crowding in the vowel space of the short vowels DRESS, \nTRAP and STRUT, leading to an overlap of DRESS and TRAP in the '*( area (as Matthews \nhinted at above). Beaken argues that a feature of adult Cockney is therefore to lengthen TRAP \nin some positions.  \nSivertsen (1960: 47) has a KIT quality close to RP, between front and central and \nbetween close and mid-close. She describes DRESS as front and between mid-close and mid-\nopen, ',( (Sivertsen 1960: 53). She also gives quite a close realisation of TRAP, using the \nsymbol '*( and stating that it is slightly closer than RP (Sivertsen 1960: 59). In addition, she \nstates that some speakers indeed replace the TRAP vowel with the DRESS vowel. For the \nSTRUT vowel, she uses '%(, but describes it as a front vowel which is between open-mid and \nopen. She states that it is not very different from the RP TRAP vowel, but not as front \n(Sivertsen 1960: 83). Sivertsen is here at odds with Matthews, who wrote that the STRUT \nvowel was \u2018more central than the standard sound. It is a vowel between the standard short u \nand the standard vowel in bird, worse, etc.\u2019 (Matthews 1938: 80). If we take \u2018standard short \nu\u2019 to represent a fully back, older RP [%], then the picture Matthews gives for older Cockney \nspeakers in the 1930s is of the open-mid central vowel which is commonly cited for modern \nRP. Fronting is probably under way by the end of the 19th century (if we assume RP to be \nconservative), since Sivertsen\u2019s description suggests that it was complete in the speech of her \ninformants, who were perhaps 25 years younger than some of those Matthews was observing. \nHurford\u2019s oldest informant, of the same generation as Sivertsen\u2019s, seems to match hers with \nrespect to having a front STRUT. As we have seen, STRUT fronting seems to have been \nreversed by the time of the next generation: those who, like Labov\u2019s Marie Colville, reached \nadulthood in mid-century. We provide more evidence of this in the instrumental data we \npresent later. \nSivertsen finds LOT also having a slightly closer realisation than in RP. For FOOT, \nthere is a little more fronting. She states that the vowel is between central and back and \nbetween close and mid-close (1960: 79).  \nHodneland (1998) has systematised the SED materials for the two localities in \nLondon, Harmondsworth (Middlesex, in the west of the conurbation) and Hackney (in the \ntraditional East End). For KIT, the overwhelming number of realisations are given as '\"(, \nthough there are four occurrences of '*(, probably due to lexical incidence (Hodneland 1998: \n12). DRESS also shows very little variation, with near-categorical realisations as '*(. Of the \n388 tokens recorded (without pre-vocalic \/l\/), 43 are raised and 15 lowered (1998: 17). For \nTRAP, there is more variation. The most frequent realisation is '.(, but the materials also \nshow '.#( (lengthening before a voiced consonant, mostly nasals), and '*( and '-( (1998: 89). \nOf the latter two realisations, '*( is most frequent, occurring 59 times out of a total of 421 \ntokens. An '-( type vowel occurs 20 times. Very little variation is indicated in STRUT, LOT \nand FOOT. It is interesting to note that there are no explicit indications of a fronted STRUT \nvowel; STRUT has a near-categorical '%( realisation (1998: 27). This is surprising, given the \nobservations of Sivertsen, Hurford and others. It is likely that the fieldworker was not \nconcerned to note finer phonetic detail, and used a \u2018generic\u2019 symbol for an open-mid vowel. \n  11 \nExamining the acrolectal variety, RP, in the second half of the 20th century reveals \nthat it has seen considerable stability. Acoustic measurements of RP vowels recorded more \nthan 30 years apart have been published by Wells (1962) and Deterding (1997). Both studies \nmeasured formant values for male RP speakers. As can be seen from Figure 1, Deterding \ngenerally has more centralised realisations for all vowels, probably due to the fact that Wells \nexamined words in isolation whilst Deterding dealt with connected speech. The striking \nfeature of this figure is the almost identical relative positions of the vowels in both studies. \n \n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n0500100015002000\nF2-F1\nF1\nKIT (D)\nDRESS (D)\nTRAP (D)\nSTRUT (D)\nLOT (D)\nFOOT (D)\nKIT (W)\nDRESS (W)\nTRAP (W)\nSTRUT (W)\nLOT (W)\nFOOT (W)\n \nFigure 1 Short monophthong qualities for male RP speakers (D=Deterding, W=Wells) \n \nHarrington, Palethorpe and Watson (2000) measured F1 and F2 for the monophthongs \nin nine of the Queen\u2019s Christmas broadcasts from the 1950s to the 1980s. They find a higher \nF1 for STRUT and TRAP in the 1980s broadcasts, in line with both sets of RP measurements \nabove. In the case of TRAP, this corresponds, they argue, to the lowering trend noted for this \nvowel in RP. A decrease in F2 is found for DRESS, TRAP and STRUT, which indicate a \nbacking of these three vowels compared to the 1950s qualities. \n To summarise, the clearest evidence we find is that, in almost all the research cited, \nthere is a more back FOOT realisation than that usually found today. For the other short \nvowels, the picture is more diffuse. However, it seems as if STRUT, in the first half of the 20th \ncentury, had undergone fronting from a central to a front vowel, only to be backed again in \nthe second half. DRESS and TRAP had rather similar, even overlapping realisations, though \nboth were closer than they are now. \n \nLOCALITIES \nIn order to examine vowel changes we have chosen two towns in the east and the west of the \nsouth-east region, situated roughly the same distance from London. Ashford is in Kent about \n  12 \n50 miles south-east of London, whilst Reading lies about 40 miles west of the capital. The \nlocations are shown in Figure 2. \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Location map  \n \nA basis for hypotheses concerning differences between accents in these two areas may \nbe found in the Survey of English Dialects (Orton and Wakelin 1967; Orton and Tilling \n1970). Two Kent locations near Ashford were investigated, Warren Street and Appledore, as \nwell as two locations close to Reading, Swallowfield in Berkshire and Binfield Heath in \nOxfordshire. The speakers in the SED were elderly and rural, and by and large represent \n\u2018traditional\u2019 dialect speech (Trudgill 1999a), rather than \u2018mainstream\u2019, urban dialects.  \n \nTable 1 SED Short vowel system \n Warren Street, \nKent \nAppledore, \nKent \nSwallowfield, \nBerkshire \nBinfield Heath, \nOxfordshire \nKIT \" \" \"- \" \nFOOT % % % % \nDRESS +, +1 +, +1 + + \nTRAP + +, ,, ,1 ,, .\/ . \nSTRUT 0 0 0 0 \nLOT 6, 67 6 68, 6&\u02d3  6 \n \n \nAs Table 1 shows, for STRUT and FOOT the SED transcription used does not give any \nobvious indication of differences. For STRUT, we find !0$ used throughout, though in \nSwallowfield !2$ appears for some items, probably representing a difference in lexical \nincidence. For FOOT, !%$, or rather its kidney-shaped antecedent !\u0277$, is used throughout. \nHowever, for KIT, DRESS, TRAP and to a certain degree LOT the story is quite different. KIT \nhas a more open quality in Swallowfield compared to the two Kent locations, while DRESS \nand TRAP have more close realisations in Kent compared to the realisations west of London. \nLOT has the primary realisation '6( in all four localities, but note that the more close quality \n'6&( also is reported in Swallowfield. The east-west differences are fairly clear, and seem not \n  13 \nto have been confounded by the fact that the first three localities in the table were \ninvestigated by the same fieldworker, with a different one for the fourth. \n \nMETHOD OF ANALYSIS \nThe present study investigated all stressed short monophthongs, KIT, DRESS, TRAP, LOT \n(some speakers only), STRUT and FOOT. Both words containing the vowels in a word list read \nby the informant and words excised from continuous interview speech were selected for \nanalysis, and the cassette and minidisc recordings were then digitised at 16 bits using a \n22,050 Hz sampling rate. All vowels for which there was a clear formant structure were used \nin the analysis, and F1 and F2 were measured using the SIL Speech Analyzer package. For \neach vowel for each informant, between 15 and 40 tokens were analysed, with vowels before \n\/l\/ excluded. In total, around 3,000 vowel tokens were analysed. The formants were measured \nin the middle of the steady state vowel on the spectrogram. A control measure of these \nfrequency values was taken on the spectrum window. \nTwo age groups were selected for analysis, speakers 14-15 years of age and speakers \nin their 70s and 80s. The adolescents were sampled through schools known to have working \nclass catchment areas, the elderly through local day centres in working class districts. A \nbreakdown of the informants is shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 Informants \n Girls Women Boys Men \nAshford 4 4 4 2 \nReading 4 3 4 2 \n \nWe present the findings as traditional plots with F1 (degree of openness) on the \nvertical axis and F2-F1 (degree of fronting) on the horizontal axis (Ladefoged 1992: 197). \nOther instrumental studies of vowels by Watt and Tillotson (2001) and Fabricius (2002) have \npresented vowel plots for individual speakers. We have chosen to examine the relative \npositions of vowels in an individual\u2019s vowel space, following Milroy and Gordon (2003: 148-\n153). There are obvious disadvantages to displaying unnormalised data for several \nindividuals on the same plot, not least because any systematic differences between groups \nwill be obscured. However, by plotting aggregate values (using the median to remove the \neffect of outliers) for speakers of the same sex (thus reducing the effect of sex-related \ndifferences in vocal tract), we are still able to detect general patterns of shift.

First, \nthe back vowel of FOOT moves to the front. Second, we find lowering of the front vowels \ninvolving DRESS and TRAP. Finally, a slight backing and raising of STRUT can be observed. \nThese movements in the vowel space are shown in Figure 9, the arrows representing the \ndirection and extent of the changes.  \n \n \nFigure 9 Short vowel changes in Ashford \n \n  20 \nLOT is also included, though measurements were only made for the male informants. \nHowever, when we try to model our findings according to Labov\u2019s Patterns 3 and 4, it is not \npossible to get a positive match, apart from the fronting of FOOT. \n With the exception of the fronting of FOOT (Pattern 3), there is little similarity with \nLabov\u2019s vowel change patterns. Front vowels are lowered (not raised) and we find no \nevidence of fronting of back vowels (of STRUT, say). Our results are thus more or less similar \nto the findings reported by others (e.g. Bauer 1985; Tollfree 1999; Torgersen 1997). In terms \nof the longer-term shift we argued for in London, the older informants here appear to be in \nline with the mid-20th century cohort of Londoners, such as Labov\u2019s Marie Colville (1994: \n169), in having a somewhat lowered DRESS and TRAP, a STRUT that is central (as with \nHurford\u2019s younger speakers, who are from this cohort) and placed immediately behind TRAP \n(and not front and beneath TRAP, as for Sivertsen\u2019s informants), and the beginnings of FOOT \nfronting. The younger informants have taken these developments a step further: DRESS and \nTRAP have moved down a little further, STRUT is slightly more back, and FOOT is much more \nfront. All this, of course, contradicts Labov\u2019s claim that Marie Colville represents a stage in \nthe Pattern 4 raising of front vowels. This is especially true when we take into account the \nevidence that the short front vowels were closer in the late nineteenth century. \nWe will now move on to the results from Reading to see if these vowel shift patterns \nare found across a greater area of south-east England. \n \nSHORT VOWEL CHANGES IN READING \nFemale informants \n \n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n1100\n05001000150020002500\nF2-F1\nF1\nFOOT\nSTRUT\nTRAP\nDRESS\nKIT\nFigure 10 Mrs B, Reading \n \n  21 \nMrs B, shown in Figure 10, has TRAP as a central, often open vowel placed behind and below \nDRESS.

The change only seems to concern the FOOT vowel, \nwhich is fronted, and the STRUT vowel, which is slightly lowered and backed. \n \nSummary of the findings in Reading \nFor Reading, there does not seem to be any particular pattern to the vowel changes, by sharp \ncontrast with the situation in Ashford. Indeed, two of the vowels, FOOT and STRUT, appear to \nbe moving in opposite directions, running counter to any chain shift. No changes are \nobserved for the other short vowels. This pattern is shown in Figure 16.  \n \n \n  26 \nFigure 16 Vowel changes in Reading  \n \nTurning to the SED from Swallowfield and Binfield Heath (Table 1), we see that, in fact, \nthere has been little or no change in these vowels in the Reading area. \n \nPARALLELS ELSEWHERE \nOther studies have reported similar developments in south-east England, as we documented \nearlier. Lowering of front vowels has also been found in Canada and California (Clarke, Elms \nand Youssef 1995). Fronting of GOOSE (and often FOOT and GOAT) is found in southern \nEngland, Australia, Canada and USA, regardless of vowel system differences and any chain \nshifts (Ash 1996; Clarke et al. 1995; Torgersen 1997). Ash (1996) has shown that GOOSE \nfronting can take place without there being any structural pressure for the vowel to change its \nlocation. Fought (1999) has found that GOOSE fronting is also present in Chicano English, \nspoken by a minority group within California. \n \nEXPLANATIONS: THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF MOTIVATIONS \nThe existence of these parallels may suggest an internally motivated explanation of the vowel \nchanges, that is, a chain shift according to the principles described above. Clearly, the \nfronting of FOOT (and that of GOOSE and GOAT) are widely observed in present-day English \nthroughout the world. Given the very great differences in the sociolinguistic set-ups, as well \nas in the vowel systems, of the varieties concerned, we can safely say that there is something \n\u2018natural\u2019 about these changes, neatly encapsulated in Principle III, even though the presence \nof a chain shift seems not to be a precondition. Likewise, although it does not fit Labov\u2019s \nPattern 4, the anticlockwise chain shift we have observed in Ashford fits extremely well with \nPrinciples II and III. On the basis of the disparate evidence from previous studies, it appears \nto be common to much of south-east England. It is very much a \u2018classic\u2019 chain shift, \ninvolving all the vowels within the short vowel subsystem. It meshes with the pervasive FOOT \nfronting found in varieties outside the geographical area of the chain shift. Trudgill \n(forthcoming), looking only at the three front vowels, considers this to be a drag chain \nbeginning with TRAP. We suggest that the crowding of the vowel space, perhaps caused by \nthe lowering of TRAP, forced STRUT to move back. If this is correct, the chain shift is one \nbeginning in the middle of the chain, initiated by the lowering of TRAP. \n Where does this leave Reading? In common with other accents west of London, \nDRESS and TRAP have long been relatively open, and they remain so today. There have, \nhowever, been two changes in Reading: the fronting of FOOT and the lowering of STRUT. We \ncan, perhaps circularly, account for a structurally unmotivated fronting of FOOT as \u2018natural\u2019, \nby pointing to its very widespread distribution and referring to Principle III.  \nThe lowering of the centralised mid short vowel of STRUT is covered by Principle II; \nit is, with the same proviso about circularity, \u2018natural\u2019. Again, it is structurally unmotivated, \nsince the move does not make STRUT notably more distinct from neighbouring vowels. \nHowever, in this case, there is a very clear geographical connection. As already noted, \nTrudgill (1986: 50-52) describes a phonetically and geographically gradual diffusion, \nradiating north and east from London, of a lowered fronted STRUT in East Anglia, where in \nthe far north of the region the traditional realisation is a close-mid back [9]. We can see the \ndevelopment in Reading as parallel to that, with an incoming more peripheral, lower vowel. \nHowever, there is a difference: we do not see any sign of fronting in Reading, rather the \nopposite. The target vowel, in the Reading case, is an open back vowel. With the new \ninformation gained from the present study, and from e.g. Kerswill and Williams (2000), we \ncan see that STRUT in the London area is now being backed, a process that, we have argued, \nstarted in the middle of the 20th century. The East Anglian and Reading data fit very well: \n  27 \nboth regions are receiving open, London-type pronunciations. Part of this involved fronting, \nat least in East Anglia where the original vowels were high and back. Now, the fronting has \nbeen arrested as a result of the newer backing of the vowel in the London area, evidenced by \nour data from Ashford and by observations in Milton Keynes \u2013 both towns which have \nreceived a large influx of Londoners in the last 30 years (Kerswill and Williams 2000; \nRudiman 1994). \n All this leads us to either an external, dialect contact explanation, or else an extra-\nlinguistic explanation: the avoidance of stigmatised forms. The convergence between \nAshford and Reading suggests regional dialect levelling of precisely the form discussed \nearlier. If we look carefully at the summary vowel charts for the two towns, we see that the \napparent-time changes over the past two generations have resulted in two vowel systems \nwhich are remarkably similar. In Ashford this involved participation in the south-east English \nshort vowel chain shift, in Reading it did not. The reason for the absence of the chain shift in \nReading is, simply, that the front vowels already had the positions in the vowel space which \nwere the targets for the change farther east in London, Kent and East Anglia (represented by \nNorwich: Trudgill 1999b: 127). \nThis might lead us to suppose that Reading (and the area west of London generally) is \nthe focal point from which the change is radiating outwards. On demographic grounds, this is \nhighly unlikely. This view is supported by the fact that, where Reading did not already have \nvowels corresponding to the end-point of the chain shift, as was the case for STRUT and \nFOOT, it has simply adjusted its vowels in order to conform to the new system. In both cases, \nthe resulting changes were not part of a chain. In sum, we are dealing with geographical \ndiffusion from London, combined with a measure of levelling (resulting from face-to-face \ncontacts and accommodation) at the local level. \nClearly, \u2018natural\u2019 factors, encapsulated by principles of chain shifting such as those of \nLabov, are important motivators of phonetic change, and largely predict its direction. \nHowever, in cases, as in Reading, where dialect contact (here manifested as diffusion from a \nmetropolitan centre) actually conflicts with natural changes, the result may be independent, \nstructurally unmotivated, change. Labov states, in the context of exceptions to his principles \nand patterns (1994: 116): \u2018[W]e will ultimately accept the finding that there are no directions \nof vowel shifting that are forbidden to speakers of human language\u2019. However, he \nimmediately adds: \u2018but we will establish that some directions are taken far more often than \nothers\u2019 (ibid.). Our position is that, while the latter observation is true on a global scale, in \nindividual cases contact and extra-linguistic factors ultimately have the capacity to override \nnatural motivations.  \nThis leads us to consider an important theoretical discussion in historical linguistics, \nalready alluded to: the dialogue between a \u2018primacy of internal motivation\u2019 view and an \n\u2018interdependence of motivations\u2019 view. Lass is a strong proponent of the primacy view (cf. \nFarrar and Jones 2002: 2-3). He considers a range of (mainly phonological) changes in the \nhistory of Germanic languages, and concludes that: \u2018[\u2026] neither language-users nor their \ninternal states ought to be the main focus of attention, if our aim is to explain [\u2026] change, \nsince change itself is a built-in property of the kind of system that a human language [\u2026] \nhappens to be\u2019 (Lass 1997: 386; quoted in Farrar and Jones 2002: 2-3). He goes on to say: \n\u2018The individual\/social perspective is at best complementary to the system perspective\u2019 (Lass \n1997: 386). This, in our view, leads him into difficulties when trying to account for the \ncounter-functional preservation of highly irregular noun morphology in Modern Icelandic, \nwhile in English the same irregularities were levelled out by the Middle English period (344-\n345; 387). He states (387): \u2018Neither Icelandic retention of consonant-stem umlaut nor English \nlevelling of it require any explanation\u2019. This is because they may simply be \u2018possible \n  28 \n(neutral) states for a system\u2019, a position he reaches having exhausted functional, language-\ninternal motivations.  \nLass states that he does not exclude the social dimension, but does not regard it as \nprimary. This is an unhelpful approach, since it leads him away from what may be the most \nexplanatory approach to the phenomenon. His position entirely neglects non-internal \nmotivations for the preservation of the morphology in one language and its loss in the other. \nTrudgill (2002) discusses the conservatism of Faroese and Icelandic morphology in terms of \nlong isolation in the Middle Ages, with low population numbers and little external contact. \nThis is contrasted with the high degree of language contact in Continental Scandinavia \n(where the same simplifications occurred as in English) and in England in the Middle Ages, \nleading to imperfect second-language learning by adults and, subsequently, morphological \nsimplification. Sand\u00f8y (2003) takes this argument a step further by differentiating between \ntwo sorts of isolated, small community: the Faroese type, where it is known that most people \nlived in villages of about 150 individuals, and the Icelandic type, where the population lived \nin isolated family units of about 10 people. In Faroe, a small degree of social marking of \nlanguage could take place within villages, while communities remained very close-knit. This \nled to linguistic differentiation between, rather than within, villages, perhaps as a marker of \nlocal allegiance. In Iceland, there was neither social stratification nor, for the children, any \npeer groups, a situation which inhibited linguistic differentiation both within a family unit \nand across the country itself.  \nThis kind of detailed argumentation is typical of the \u2018interdependence\u2019 model, and has \nproved fruitful not just in historical cases, but also in the studies of contemporary societies \nreviewed earlier in this article. These studies reveal the interplay of factors, and suggest the \nprimacy (in the end) of contact\/isolation and extra-linguistic motivations. We subscribe to the \nview, expressed by Farrar and Jones (2002: 8), that we must not assume an \u2018unspoken \nhierarchy of explanatory adequacy\u2019, favouring internal factors. They go on to say that our \n\u2018naivety\u2019 in terms of the sociolinguistic part of the explanation should not lead us to look \nharder for internal explanations. We disagree with the proposition that social dialectologists \nsuffer from such naivety. We would go further and say that, now, social dialectology is able \nto provide quite detailed insights into some of these external and extra-linguistic factors, as \nwell as the relative importance of the factors in particular cases. It takes studies such as those \nreviewed, as well as the data presented in this article, to provide firm evidence for claims \nabout the social and linguistic embedding of change. This is, of course, a statement of \nLabov\u2019s position; where we differ from him is in the belief that dialect contact is not simply \nexceptional, but (along with extra-linguistic factors) is integral to the understanding of this \nembedding.  \n \n  29 \nNOTES\n                                                 \n1  These and other keywords are used mnemonically following Wells (1982). \n \n2  Trudgill has suggested that he has used this symbol for vowels closer than the \ncardinal quality (personal communication). \n \n\n  31 \nREFERENCES \n \nAsh, Sharon. 1996.
