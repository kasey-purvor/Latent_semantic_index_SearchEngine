The\neffect on the X-ray absorption coef\u00aecient of including multiple-\nelectron excitations is also determined and is found to be small, again\nin agreement with observation.\nKeywords: X-ray absorption; EXAFS; many-body theory.\n1. Introduction\nThe theory of X-ray absorption is usually described in one-electron\nterms. This theory gives very good results for the X-ray absorption\ncoef\u00aecient (Gurman, 1983). A one-electron theory also gives good\nresults for the extended X-ray absorption \u00aene structure (EXAFS),\nexcept for the amplitude. However, it is known from studies on the\nnoble gases (e.g. Bartlett et al., 1992) that 20\u00b130% of X-ray absorp-\ntion processes give rise to multiple-electron excitation. This value is\nin line with the empirical amplitude reduction factor applied in early\nEXAFS analyses. In order to describe such processes, and so obtain a\ncorrect value for the EXAFS amplitude, we need to use a many-body\ntheory. Such theories are complicated and computationally intensive.\nWe describe here a simple model which correctly gives the multiple-\nexcitation probability (and hence the EXAFS amplitude reduction\nfactor) as a function of photon energy for all atoms with very little\ncomputational effort. We also show why the X-ray absorption coef-\n\u00aecient is only very slightly altered by the inclusion of these many-\nbody effects, despite the high probability of multiple-electron exci-\ntation.\nIn EXAFS studies, multiple-electron excitation on X-ray absorp-\ntion (intrinsic losses) is not the only loss process which needs to be\nconsidered. There are also the extrinsic losses suffered by the\nphotoelectron during its passage through the material. These are\nusually described in terms of a mean-free-path factor. We do not\nconsider such losses here. Strictly, the intrinsic and extrinsic losses\ncannot be separated in this simple way, since they may interfere with\none another. This interference is signi\u00aecant at low photoelectron\nenergies (Hedin, 1989). Since it treats only the intrinsic losses, our\ntheory completely neglects these interference processes.\nWe \u00aerst consider multiple-electron excitation in the limit of high\nphoton energy, where we use the `sudden approximation' (Schiff,\n1968). We need a form for the one-electron wavefunctions of all\natomic states and use the Slater form [the single zeta functions of\nClementi & Roetti (1974), which are themselves \u00aetted to Hartree\u00b1\nFock wavefunctions]. The screening parameters which appear in\nthese wavefunctions are obtained using a modi\u00aeed form of Slater's\nrules. Thus we obtain an accurate representation of the atomic\nwavefunctions without the need for large amounts of input data. The\nresults of the sudden approximation are compared with the values of\nthe EXAFS amplitude reduction factor S 20 derived from many\nEXAFS analyses.\nWe go on to consider the energy dependence of the multiple-\nelectron excitation probability, using a development of the model\nproposed by Thomas (1984). We \u00aend that an analytic expression for\nthe energy-dependent probability can be obtained which is in good\nagreement with experimental data from rare gases. This form\nprovides an energy-dependent form for S 20 which could be used in\nEXAFS analysis to avoid the need for calculations using a complex\npotential.\nFinally, we calculate the X-ray absorption coef\u00aecient itself,\nincluding multiple-electron excitations, and show why these do not\ngreatly alter the results obtained, again in agreement with experi-\nment.\nWe therefore obtain a model description of multiple-electron\nprocesses in X-ray absorption which involves very little computing or\ninput data and which provides an accurate description of the\nobserved phenomena.\n2. The high-energy limit\n2.1. The sudden approximation\nWhen an atom absorbs an X-ray photon, a photoelectron and a\nhole in a deep core state are produced. The core-hole\/photoelectron\nsystem corresponds to a time-dependent change in potential that is, in\ngeneral, extremely complex. This more general case is considered in\nthe next section. We \u00aerst consider the limit of extremely high photon\nenergies. In this limit, the photoelectron has a very high kinetic\nenergy and leaves the atom very rapidly. The other electrons, which\nwe shall refer to as passive electrons, then relax under the in\u00afuence of\nthe core-hole potential alone. Within this approximation, the passive\nelectrons experience an abrupt change in Hamiltonian so that there is\na possibility that they too may be excited into the continuum (we\nneglect the very weak bound\u00b1bound transitions) giving rise to a\nmultiple-electron excitation. The effect of the core-hole potential on\nthese electrons can be described in terms of the sudden approxima-\ntion (Schiff, 1968).\nWe describe the wavefunction of the electrons in the atom in\nHartree form, as a single product of one-electron wavefunctions.\nWithin the sudden approximation, the boundary condition is that the\nwavefunction shall be continuous across the abrupt change in\nHamiltonian. The probability that a given passive electron is then not\nexcited is given by\nPi \u0088  ij 0i\n\n \u000b\f\f \f\f2; \u00851\u0086\nwhere the unprimed wavefunctions relate to the unperturbed atom\nand the primed wavefunctions to the atom with a core hole present.\nThe probability that no passive electrons are excited is then the\nproduct of such terms over all passive electrons. This is the prob-\nability that only one photoelectron is produced. The theory of\nEXAFS (Stern, 1988) shows that this is equal to S 20, the amplitude\nreduction factor for EXAFS. Thus we have\nS 20 \u0088\nQ\ni\n ij 0i\n\n \u000b\f\f \f\f2; \u00852\u0086\nand 1 \u00ff S 20 is equal to the probability of a multiple-electron excita-\ntion occurring. This expression for S 20 was \u00aerst obtained by Rehr et al.\n(1978). The proportion of multiple-electron events can be measured\nJ. Synchrotron Rad.

The EXAFS amplitude reduction factor for\nvery many atoms can be obtained from the many early EXAFS\nanalyses, where this parameter had to be \u00aetted to data obtained from\na standard sample with known coordination number (usually a metal\nfoil).\n2.2. Wavefunctions\nIn order to be able to calculate the multiple-electron probability\nwe need to know the form of the atomic wavefunctions. Accurate\nwavefunctions are available, derived from self-consistent Hartree\u00b1\nFock calculations (Clementi & Roetti, 1974). In order to obtain a\ngeneric form, we use wavefunctions of the Slater type, \u00aetted to these\naccurate wavefunctions. These are the single zeta functions of\nClementi & Roetti (1974). Thus we have\n \u0088 2\u0010\u0085 \u0086\nn\u00871=2\n\u00852n!\u00861=2 r\nn\u00ff1 exp \u00ff\u0010r\u0085 \u0086Ylm: \u00853\u0086\nThe quantity \u0010 which appears in these wavefunctions can be written in\nterms of a screening factor \u001b,\n\u0010 \u0088 Z \u00ff \u001b\u0085 \u0086=n; \u00854\u0086\nwhere we use atomic units, such that r is given in terms of the Bohr\nradius. The values of \u001b, obtained from the tables of Clementi & Roetti\n(1974), can be \u00aetted by a modi\u00aeed version of Slater's rules. In this way\nwe obtain a generic form for the wavefunctions of all electrons in all\natoms. Our modi\u00aecation of Slater's rules is described in Appendix A:\nthey give a good \u00aet to the tabulated zeta values and so give good\nwavefunctions for the calculation of multiple-electron excitation\nprobabilities in the high-energy limit.\nThe Slater wavefunctions give, for the probability of a given\npassive electron remaining unexcited, the expression\nPi \u0088 4\u0010\u00100\u0085 \u00862n\u00871= \u0010 \u0087 \u00100\u0085 \u00864n\u00872; \u00855\u0086\nwhere, once again, unprimed values relate to the unperturbed atom\nand primed values to the atom with a core hole present. Since the\nperturbation is due to a deep core hole, Slater's rules give\n\u001b0 \u0088 \u001b \u0087 1; \u00856\u0086\nunless the passive electron state is either below, the same as or next\nabove the core-hole state. For hard X-ray excitation, none of these\nconditions apply for passive electrons which have an appreciable\nprobability of excitation. Thus equation (6) corresponds to the\ncommonly used Z + 1 approximation for the relaxed \u00aenal states used\nwhen calculating atomic scattering factors in EXAFS.\n\u0010 is fairly large for all atomic states. Thus we can approximate the\nresult given in (5) to give\nPi \u0088 1 \u00ff\n2n\u0087 1\n4n2\u00102\n: \u00857\u0086\nSince the energy Ei of the state is approximately given by the square\nof \u0010 (in atomic units) we see that the probability of excitation of a\npassive electron falls off roughly as E\u00ff1i . Thus only weakly bound\npassive electrons are likely to be excited, as we would expect. We\nactually use the full form, equation (5), in our calculations.\nWe note that our calculation is appropriate to an isolated atom in\nthat we take the atomic states to be discrete levels. We can extend the\ncalculation to include bonding effects in the tight-binding approx-\nimation (Roy, 1999). For full bands this extended calculation gives the\nsame results as the atomic calculation, while for partially \u00aelled bands\nthe correction is always less than 10% (Roy et al., 1997). Thus we use\nthe simpler atomic calculations in our comparison with EXAFS data.\n2.3. The EXAFS amplitude reduction factor\nWe may compare our results with experiment in the form of the\nEXAFS amplitude reduction factor S 20, which is assumed to be\nenergy independent, or the high-energy limit of ion charge data in\nphotoionization.\nFirst of all we note that the amplitude reduction factor will be very\nsimilar for K and L edges of the same element, since it only differs in\nthe two cases by the excitation probability of the 1s state, which is\nvery small for X-ray photons.\nUsing the modi\u00aeed Slater's rules to obtain \u0010 and \u00100 we can easily\ncalculate P for any orbital and S 20 for any atom, using equations (2)\nand (5). The values of S 20 obtained in this way are shown in Fig. 1. The\ncalculated amplitude reduction factor has a characteristic depen-\ndence on atomic number, essentially following the ionization poten-\ntial as we argued it would following equation (7). For Z > 10, the\nregion of interest for EXAFS, it lies between 0.65 and 0.80. Our\ncalculated values for S 20 are very similar to those calculated (Roy et\nal., 1997) using the full tabulated wavefunctions of Clementi & Roetti\n(1974). Thus it appears that the Slater wavefunctions, \u00aetted to the\nsingle zeta function approximations of these wavefunctions, give a\nsuf\u00aeciently accurate form for the wavefunction.\nFig. 1 also shows values of the amplitude reduction factor obtained\nfrom many EXAFS data analyses (Roy et al., 1997) which used the\nreal X\u000b scattering potential (and hence required empirical amplitude\nfactors) in early versions of the data-analysis program EXCURV.\nAlso shown on Fig. 1 are the results obtained by Carlson (1967) using\nHartree\u00b1Fock wavefunctions and some data from ion charge\nmeasurements (Carlson et al., 1968; Holland et al., 1979; Armen et al.,\n1985; Bartlett et al., 1992). We note that our results are in fairly good\nagreement with the full calculation and essentially always agree with\nexperiment to within the experimental uncertainties. The poorest\nagreement occurs for the 3d and 4d elements: we believe this is due to\nthe lower accuracy of the single zeta form for these orbitals, which\nhave two large components in their full form (Clementi & Roetti,\nFigure 1\nHigh-energy limit of multiple-electron excitation probability. Solid line:\ncalculated values for the K edge. Dashed line: calculated values for the L3\nedge. Points: calculated values from Carlson et al. (1968). Points with error\nbars: experimental data from K-edge EXAFS \u00aets (S 20). Large points:\nexperimental data from ion charge measurements.\nelectronic reprint\n1974). There is also a problem when the hole is located in the\noutermost orbital (e.g. Ne L edge). This is due to electron correlation\nand occurs in all calculations. It is of no signi\u00aecance for X-ray studies,\nbut is rather a problem for UV photoemission.\nThus we conclude that we can successfully model the high-energy\nlimit of the multiple-electron excitation probability in a way which\nrequires little input data or computing.\n3. The energy dependence of the multiple-electron excitation\nprobability\nIn the previous section the sudden approximation was used to\ncalculate the multiple-electron excitation probability in the limit of\nextremely high photon energies. In this section we consider the\nphoton energy dependence of this probability. The core-hole\/photo-\nelectron system is considered using a spatially and temporally varying\nmodel potential and analyzed using standard time-dependent\nperturbation theory. The temporal variation of the perturbation\narises because the photoelectron takes a \u00aenite time to leave the atom,\nthis time depending on the size of the atom and the energy of the\nphotoelectron. This gives rise to an energy dependence of the exci-\ntation probability. At very high photoelectron energies, the results of\nthis calculation should tend to those found using the sudden\napproximation, and we use this to normalize our results, so avoiding\nmuch computation.\nThe problem of multiple-electron excitation in photoionization has\nbeen studied by many authors. Most of these calculations are extre-\nmely complex (e.g. Chang & Poe, 1975; Carter & Kelly, 1977) and\ncomputationally intensive. They also require much input data. Here\nwe seek a simple model which will describe the energy dependence of\nthe multiple electron probability with reasonable accuracy and with\nlittle input or computation. Such a model has been described in\noutline by Thomas (1984) and we use this as the basis of our work.\nFollowing Gadzuk & Sunjic (1975), we \u00aerst approximate the time-\nand position-dependent perturbation V(r, t) due to the core-hole\/\nphotoelectron system as a product of time-dependent and position-\ndependent parts,\nV r; t\u0085 \u0086 \u0088 V r\u0085 \u0086 f t\u0085 \u0086; \u00858\u0086\nwith a time dependence of the form\nf t\u0085 \u0086 \u0088 1 \u00ff exp \u00fft=t0\u0085 \u0086: \u00859\u0086\nt0 is a characteristic time which we write as\nt0 \u0088 R=v; \u008510\u0086\nwhere R is a characteristic distance in the atom and represents the\nsize of the orbital of the passive electron; v is the speed of the\nphotoelectron. With this form, the passive electron sees the full core-\nhole potential V(r) as t ! 1, when the photoelectron has left the\natom.\nTime-dependent perturbation theory gives the probability ampli-\ntude of a passive electron being excited from an atomic orbital |ii to a\npropagating state |ki due to the perturbation V(r, t) as\naik \u0088 ijV r\u0085 \u0086jk\n\n \u000b R1\n0\nexp i Ei \u00ff Ek\u0085 \u0086t\n\u0002 \u0003\nf t\u0085 \u0086 dt: \u008511\u0086\nUsing the form of perturbation given above we can evaluate the\nintegral if we include a convergence factor exp(\u00ff\u000et) in V(r, t). This\nconvergence factor physically represents the \u00aenite core-hole lifetime.\nWe then \u00aend a transition probability\naik\n\f\f \f\f2\u0088 i Vj jkh ij j2\nEi \u00ff Ek\u0085 \u00862 1 \u0087 t20 Ei \u00ff Ek\u0085 \u00862\n\u0002 \u0003 : \u008512\u0086\nIn order to obtain the total excitation probability we must sum\nover all \u00aenal states which are accessible, i.e. which obey energy\nconservation. Replacing the sum by an integral and introducing a\ndensity of \u00aenal states we \u00aend a total probability\nP h- !\u0085 \u0086 \u0088 A REmax\n0\nE1=2\ni Vj jkh ij j2\nEB \u0087 E\u0085 \u00862 1 \u0087 t20 EB \u0087 E\u0085 \u00862\n\u0002 \u0003 dE; \u008513\u0086\nwith E the energy of the \u00aenal state |ki and EB the (positive) binding\nenergy of the initial passive electron state |ii. Emax is given by energy\nconservation as Ep \u00ff EB, where Ep is the energy of the primary\nphotoelectron, equal to h- ! \u00ff Eedge. The factor A includes all the\nconstants.\nWe use the Slater orbitals as our initial states |ii and propagating\nspherical waves (free electron approximation) normalized to unit\namplitude as the \u00aenal states |ki. Taking the core-hole potential as a\nCoulomb potential we then \u00aend\ni Vj jkh ij j2\u0088 B= k2 \u0087 \u00102\u00ff \u0001n \u0088 B0= E\u0087 EB\u0085 \u0086n; \u008514\u0086\nwith B and B0 constants. The second form of equation (14) is obtained\nby replacing k2\/2 by the \u00aenal-state energy E (we use atomic units) and\n\u00102\/2 by the binding energy of the initial state EB .

Thus\nwe have only to evaluate the remaining integral. It is this normal-\nization to the high-energy limit which produces much of the simplicity\nof our \u00aenal result.\nEquation (16) is obtained using an atomic calculation, with the\ninitial state of the passive electron an atomic level, not a band. As we\nnoted in the previous section, full bands give the same result as\natomic levels in the high-energy limit, with partially \u00aelled bands\nchanging the result by less than 10%. The integral of (16) remains\n\u00aenite as EB goes to zero (as occurs when the passive electron lies at\nthe Fermi level) so, at worst, including bonding effects (which will\ninvolve an integral over EB) will only alter the energy dependence of\nP\u0085h- !\u0086. Such effects are expected to be small (Roy et al., 1997) and so\nwe continue to use the simpler atomic calculation.\nt0 is given by equation (10).

Thus no secondary electrons are excited until an energy\nEB above the absorption edge.\nThe integral may be evaluated analytically [by splitting it into\npartial fractions and using Gradshteyn & Ryzhik (1980); 2.216 and\n2.225], giving a result in terms of the photon energy and the binding\nenergies of the core hole and the passive electron. We therefore\nobtain a general result for the multiple-electron excitation probability\nwhich involves very little computation or input data. We can compare\nthe predictions of this model with experimental data obtained for\nrare gases: we do this below. The result also gives the energy-\ndependent EXAFS amplitude reduction factor which could be used\nin data analysis. We also note that equation (18) gives P as a function\nof two parameters, the ratio Ep \/EB, the ratio of the primary photo-\nelectron energy to the binding energy of the passive electron, and n,\nthe principal quantum number of the passive electron orbital. We can\ntherefore plot a canonical form for P as a function of these two\nvariables. This is shown in Fig. 2. We note that P has reached\nessentially its high-energy limit by a few times EB above the edge,\nrising somewhat more slowly for higher values of n. Since only the\noutermost electrons give a signi\u00aecant contribution to the total\nmultiple electron probability, this means that the EXAFS amplitude\nreduction factor will reach its full value within a few tens of eV above\nthe edge, with a slower rise for heavier atoms. The rapid rise accounts\nfor the success of simple analyses made using a constant value for the\nreduction factor.\nThe results shown in Fig. 2 depend on our value for t0, i.e. the value\nwe take for R. Values other than the one we use could be tried.\nHowever, they all give a very similar form for P. Thus if we choose R\nas the peak in the radial charge density r 2| |2, we merely replace\nn \u00ff 1 by n and so can still use Fig. 2. If we choose the expectation\nvalue hri we need to replace n \u00ff 1 by n + 1\/2. Both these models give\na slower rise in P for a given n. Comparison with experimental data\nfrom rare gases (see below) suggests that our present form gives the\nbest agreement.\n3.1. Multiple electron probabilities in rare gases\nExperimental data on the photon energy dependence of the\nmultiple-electron excitation probability is available for the rare gases.\nIn Fig. 3 we show a comparison between our results, obtained using\nequation (18), and the value of P(1) obtained as in x2, and the\nexperimental data of Armen et al. (1985) for the K edge of argon. The\nargon K edge lies at 3203 eV and we have taken the binding energy of\nthe n = 3 state (the passive electron) as 15 eV, the \u00aerst ionization\npotential of argon. This is probably a little low, since the core hole will\nlower the 3sp energy somewhat (a relaxation shift). In the energy\nrange of the data, only the 3s and 3p passive electrons can be excited.\nWe note that the sudden approximation gives a good estimate of the\nhigh-energy end of the data, as is clear from Fig. 1 also. The shape of\nthe energy variation is also well reproduced, although the rise is a\nlittle too rapid in the calculated values. The data for the K edge of\nneon (Carlson & Krause, 1965) is similarly well described (Roy,\n1999). In the case of the neon L edge (Bartlett et al., 1992) and the\nargon M edge (Holland et al., 1979) the energy dependence is accu-\nrately reproduced (Lindsay, 2000) by equation (18) but the limit\nP(1) is poorly calculated by the sudden approximation owing to\nproblems with electron correlation noted in x2.\nThe use of the experimental binding energy rather than that given\nby the screening coef\u00aecient calls for some comment. We \u00aend much\nbetter agreement with experiment, for all rare gases, using the former.\nIt appears that, although the single Slater orbital gives a good\nrepresentation of the overall wavefunction [and hence good values\nfor P(1)], it does not give accurate values for the binding energies,\n\u00102\/2 normally being considerably larger than EB . Nor does it give a\ngood representation of the energy dependence of the matrix elements\n(Roy, 1999). The use of experimental energies, which are easily\naccessible for all levels as the X-ray edge energies, appears to solve\nboth these problems.\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the K-edge EXAFS amplitude reduction factor\nS 20 = 1 \u00ff P\u0085h- !\u0086 for silicon, copper and silver, calculated using this\nmodel. The energy dependence agrees with the commonly held view\nFigure 2\nCanonical form for the energy-dependent multiple-electron probability P(Ep).\nEp is the primary photoelectron energy, Ep = h- ! \u00ff Eedge, EB the binding\nenergy, and n the principal quantum number, of the initial state of the passive\nelectron.

The model results also agree closely with\nthose calculated using the local density approximation (LDA) (Roy,\n1999; Roy & Gurman, 2001). The LDA calculation is known to give\ngood results for the EXAFS amplitude reduction factor and so we\nmay say that our model will also.\nWe may also note that the integrand of (16) gives the probability\nthat a passive electron will be excited to an energy E [the primary\nphotoelectron will then have an energy Ep \u00ff (E + EB)]. Thus the\nintegrand can be used to predict the secondary electron spectrum in\nX-ray photoemission. We (Roy, 1999) \u00aend reasonable agreement with\nthe experimental data (Carlson, 1967) for this spectrum.\n4. The X-ray absorption coef\u00aecient\nWe have noted that a one-electron calculation gives good results for\nthe X-ray absorption coef\u00aecient (Gurman, 1983). We have also noted\nthat 20\u00b130% of X-ray absorption events give rise to multiple-electron\nexcitation. We now try to show how these two points may be resolved.\nIf we take Thomas' (1984) model at face value then there is no\nproblem. In this model the photoelectron is emitted before it interacts\nwith the passive electrons, so the absorption process is described\nsolely in one-electron terms. However, this is physically untenable:\none-electron and multiple-electron processes form different channels\nfor the excitation of the atom and must be considered as separate\nprocesses.\nIf we consider separate channels, then the measured X-ray\nabsorption coef\u00aecient is a sum of one-electron and multiple-electron\nprocesses. In the latter, only the sum of the \u00aenal energies of the two\nexcited electrons is \u00aexed. We can therefore write the total absorption\ncoef\u00aecient \u0016(!) as\n\u0016 h- !\u0085 \u0086 \u0088 1 \u00ffP aik\f\f \f\f2\nh i\n\u00161 h\n- !\u0085 \u0086 \u0087 P aik\f\f \f\f2\u00161 h- !\u00ff Eik\u0085 \u0086: \u008519\u0086\nThe \u00aerst term is the one-electron channel. In the second term we have\nthe probability of exciting a passive electron to a \u00aenal state |ki\nmultiplying the absorption coef\u00aecient appropriate to a photoelectron\nof diminished \u00aenal energy, summed over all available \u00aenal states.\nEquation (19) looks physically reasonable and can also be derived\nusing a many-body theory of photon absorption.\nWe now expand the one-electron absorption coef\u00aecient which\nappears in the second term about the photon energy h- !. We then \u00aend\n\u0016 h- !\u0085 \u0086 \u0088 \u00161 h- !\u0085 \u0086 \u0087\nd\u00161\ndE h\n- !\n\f\f X aik\f\f \f\f2Eik; \u008520\u0086\nso that the absorption coef\u00aecient is equal to the one-electron value\nplus a correction term. The one-electron absorption coef\u00aecient may\nbe fairly accurately described by a power law form\n\u00161 h\n- !\u0085 \u0086 \u0088 \u00161 h- !e\u0085 \u0086 Ee=E\u0085 \u0086n; \u008521\u0086\nwith n about 3 or 4 (this is a slightly simpli\u00aeed version of the standard\nVictoreen form) and h- !e the energy of the edge. When we substitute\nthis form into equation (20) we \u00aend\n\u0016 h- !\u0085 \u0086 \u0088 \u00161 h- !\u0085 \u0086 1 \u00ff n\nP\naik\n\f\f \f\f2Eik=h- !\nh i\n: \u008522\u0086\nNow, |aik|\n2 is only large for small values of Eik: according to equations\n(12) and (13) it is effectively the slope of the plot of P(h- !). Thus the\nfactor Eik\/h- ! is very small, of the order of the ratio of the binding\nenergy of the passive electron to that of the core electron. For the\nargon K-edge data used above, this ratio is 15\/3200. Also, the sum\nrises from zero in a manner very similar to that shown by P(h- !). [The\nsum is actually given by equation (16) with the power n + 2 replaced\nby n + 1 in the denominator: Fig. 2 shows that this change has little\neffect.] We therefore expect to see very little change in the X-ray\nabsorption coef\u00aecient when multiple-electron excitations become\nenergetically allowed: just a very weak kink as is actually observed\n(e.g. Deutsch & Hart, 1986; Filipponi, 1995). Such small changes may\nbe expected, since both the one-electron and the many-body calcu-\nlations of the X-ray absorption coef\u00aecient obey the same sum rule,\nthe Thomas\u00b1Reiche\u00b1Kuhn sum rule.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have described a simple generic model for many-body effects in\nX-ray absorption. Our major purpose has been to provide a theory\nwhich gives the probability of multiple-electron excitation, and hence\nthe EXAFS amplitude reduction factor, in a form which requires\nlittle computing or input data. We achieved this by the use of Slater\norbitals, with the screening constants \u00aetted to modern wavefunction\nresults (Clementi & Roetti, 1974) and so calculated using a modi\u00aeed\nform of Slater's rules. For the energy dependence we have used a\ndevelopment of the model originally proposed by Thomas (1984)\nwhich gives an analytic result for the energy-dependent probability,\nnormalized to the high-energy limit calculated in the sudden\napproximation.\nThe results obtained using this model agree well with experimental\ndata, both for the standard EXAFS amplitude reduction factor S 20\n(which is assumed constant, so is given by the high-energy limit) and\nfor the energy-dependent probability as measured for rare gases.\nOne possible application of our results is in EXAFS data analysis.\nAt present the major data-analysis codes use complex potentials\nderived from the local density approximation (the Hedin\u00b1Lundqvist\npotential). This gives good results for the amplitude reduction in the\nenergy region of interest for EXAFS (photoelectron energies up to\nabout 1 keV), although this is largely fortuitous (Roy & Gurman,\n1999, 2001). However, use of this potential involves calculating the\nphotoelectron scattering using a complex potential. It may be more\nconvenient to calculate the EXAFS spectrum using a real potential,\nsuch as the energy-dependent Hara potential which is known to give\ngood results (Woolfson et al., 1982) with the intrinsic losses described\nby S 20 included using this model, which requires very little input data.\nThe extrinsic losses also need to be included, but this can be\nperformed in terms of the standard mean-free-path term.\nJ.

In order to avoid much input\ndata, the parameter \u0010 which appears in the formula was written in\nterms of a screening parameter \u001b [equation (4)] which was itself\ncalculated using a modi\u00aeed version of Slater's rules.\nSlater's rules in their original form were proposed in 1930 (Slater,\n1930) on the basis of \u00aetting to some of the earliest calculated wave-\nfunctions. Since that date, wavefunction calculations have been\nimproved and extended, requiring some modi\u00aecation to the rules. We\nhave kept to the spirit of the original rules, but modi\u00aeed them to give\nthe best \u00aet to the screening factors derived from the single zeta\nfunctions of Clementi & Roetti (1974).\nSlater (1930) \u00aerst divided the electrons into groups: 1s, (2s 2p),\n(3s 3p), 3d, (4s 4p) etc. The contribution of each electron to the\nscreening factor was then given by:\n(a) Nothing from any shell outside the one considered.\n(b) An amount 0.35 from each other electron in the group\nconsidered, except in the 1s group where 0.30 is used.\n(c) If the shell considered is an s, p shell, an amount 0.85 from each\nelectron with principal quantum number less by one and an amount\n1.00 from each electron still further in; but if the shell is a d or f, an\namount 1.00 from every electron inside it.\nSlater also used an effective principal quantum number n* instead\nof n in equation (3) for all n > 3.\nIn order to obtain a best \u00aet to the single zeta functions of Clementi\n& Roetti (1974), we need to modify the rules, principally by including\na small screening effect from electrons outside the shell considered:\nwithout this contribution deep shells become underscreened and\ntheir contribution to S 20 too high (Roy et al., 1997). Thus we use the\nsame grouping of levels but with the following rules:\n(a) For every electron outside the group considered, an amount 0.1\nelectron for s or p electrons, nothing for d or f electrons.\n(b) For every other electron in the group considered, 0.33 electron,\nexcept for 1s where 0.30 is used.\n(c) For electrons in groups inside that considered. Electrons with\nthe same principal quantum number as the group considered\ncontribute 0.45 if s or p; 0.1 if d or f. For electrons with a principal\nquantum number less by one than that considered: 0.9 electrons for\nevery d or f electron and an amount 1.00 \u00ff 0.2(n \u00ff 2) for every s and\np electron (n is the principal quantum number of the passive electron\nunder consideration), if the group considered is s or p; 0.55 electrons\nfor every d or f electron and 1.00 for every s or p electron, if the group\nconsidered is a d or f electron. Electrons with a principal quantum\nnumber more than one less than that of the group considered, a\ncontribution of 1.00 per electron.\nThe complex form of our rule (c) replaces Slater's effective prin-\ncipal quantum numbers and also more accurately describes the\ndifferences between s, p and d, f electrons. These three rules give a\ngood description of the screening of all electrons: three examples are\nshown in Fig. 5. For these three examples the rules may be written\nalgebraically as\n2sp : \u001b \u0088 1:0N1s \u0087 0:33 N2sp \u00ff 1\n\u00ff \u0001\u0087 0:1 N3sp \u0087 N4sp \u0087 . . .\u00ff \u0001;\n3d : \u001b \u0088 1:0 N1s \u0087 N2sp\n\u00ff \u0001\u0087 0:45N3sp \u0087 0:33 N3d \u00ff 1\u0085 \u0086;\n5sp : \u001b \u0088 1:0 N1s \u0087 N2sp \u0087 N3sp \u0087 N3d\n\u00ff \u0001\u0087 0:4N4sp\n\u0087 0:9N4d \u0087 0:33 N5sp \u00ff 1\n\u00ff \u0001\n: \u008523\u0086\nIn order to calculate the screening coef\u00aecients \u001b and \u001b0, for atoms\nwithout and with a core hole, we simply use the appropriate occu-\npancies. It is then clear from equation (23) that, as long as the core\nhole is much deeper than the passive electron, \u001b0 = \u001b + 1 as noted in\nequation (6). Since only the least-bound passive electrons contribute\nsigni\u00aecantly to S 20 [equation (7)], this is always the case for hard\nX-rays, the only case of interest for EXAFS.\nReferences\nArmen, G.
