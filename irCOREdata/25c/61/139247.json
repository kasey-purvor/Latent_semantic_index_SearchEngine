MIS Quarterly 20 (3), xxxvii.32 APPENDIX A: Business Background COMPANY 1 Company 1 is a large Swiss multinational operating in the machinery and equipment industry. The major business activities of the subsidiary include manufacturing, sales and marketing of piping systems. The study was focused on its subsidiary in the UK but interviews and sites visited also covered the HQ in Switzerland. COMPANY 2 Company 2 is a US-based multinational classified under the financial industry. The study was focused on its subsidiary in Malaysia but a telephone interview was also held with its CIO in the USA. The main activities of the subsidiary involve commercial and investment banking activities. COMPANY 3 Company 3 is a US-based multinational classified in the electronics industry. The study was focused on its subsidiary in Malaysia but interviews and site visits also covered three senior IT interviewees in its headquarters in the USA. The main business activities of the subsidiary involve assembly and testing of semiconductor components produced by other subsidiaries of the multinational. COMPANY 4 Company 4 is a large multinational based in The Netherlands. The company is classified under the chemicals industry. The study was focused on its subsidiary in Malaysia but also involved a site visit and interview with its corporate CIO in The Netherlands. The main activities of the subsidiary involve manufacturing of soap noodles using oleo-chemicals. COMPANY 5 Company 5 is a Japanese multinational and one of the largest companies classified under the electronics industry. The study was focused on one of its subsidiaries in Malaysia, which is also one of the major subsidiaries of the group. The business operations of the subsidiary involve manufacturing of videos and colour televisions. Most of the products are exported through the company\u2019s sales distributor COMPANY 6 Company 6 is a large UK-based multinational classified under the food and beverages industry. Its principal activities include manufacture and supply of foods, household care, and personal products. The study was focused on its subsidiary in Malaysia. Since the subsidiary phased out its manufacturing activities a few years ago, its main activities now involve sales and distribution of products manufactured by other sister companies. COMPANY 7 Company 7 is a large and diversified Japanese multinational classified under the apparel and textiles industry. The company started its operations in Malaysia in the early 1970s and now is made up of seven companies. The main activities of the Malaysian group include production of polyester staple fibre, polyester film, ABS resins, and electronic products but mainly finished fabric, yarn, and grey fabric. COMPANY 8 Company 8 is a large French-based multinational classified under the telecommunications industry. The study was focused on its subsidiary in Malaysia. The main business activities of the subsidiary involve distribution of telecommunications equipment and manufacturing of power supply products. COMPANY 9 Company 9 is a large US-based multinational operating in the food and beverages industry. The group carries some of the most known brands in the worldwide market. The study was focused on its subsidiary in Malaysia. The main business activities of the subsidiary are sales and marketing of global beverage products.33 APPENDIX B: Summary of IS Planning COMPANY 1 IS planning in the UK subsidiary 1 is decentralised, while in other subsidiaries it is centralised. The corporate interviewees explained that this is due to the subsidiary being the most profitable within the group. The subsidiary noted that IS planning enables them to focus on being innovative in IS\/IT. No major issues were raised by the subsidiary interviewees. The IS planning in the subsidiary follows the Organisational approach and IS\/IT is planned through informal meetings and discussions with the business managers. Both the subsidiary IT and business interviewees believe the approach they follow has been successful. COMPANY 2 IS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary is fairly centralised with directions for IS\/IT applications coming from the regional office in Singapore, business group headquarters in the UK, and corporate headquarters in the USA. To control cost and streamline processes, the main focus of IS planning is to maximise scale economies through standardisation and use of regional systems and global infrastructure. Being a small subsidiary, the subsidiary believes that their specific business needs get little priority in the central\/regional IS\/IT plan. The subsidiary felt that the Administrative approach they follow has been satisfactory. COMPANY 3 IS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary has been fairly centralised. In order to control costs, maximising scale economies is clearly the main focus of IS planning. Even though the Company is trying to shift from the Technology \u2013led approach to the Business-led approach, the current IS planning is clearly following the Administrative approach. The subsidiary interviewees are concerned about their specific business needs not adequately addressed by the global systems they were asked to adopt. Overall, the subsidiary felt that the current IS planning approach is satisfactory. COMPANY 4 IS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary is highly centralised. With the group\u2019s poor business performance and problems integrating different systems worldwide, controlling costs and streamlining business processes receive the highest attention by the new corporate CIO. The focus of IS planning is clearly to maximise scale economies and the IS planning approach is Administrative. With only one person in charge of IS\/IT in the subsidiary, many issues were raised by the subsidiary interviewees. The subsidiary felt that the current IS planning approach is less than satisfactory. COMPANY 5 IS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary is fairly centralised, with directions coming from four headquarters (for four different business units), all based in Japan. Focus of IS planning is to maximise scale economies through global systems and infrastructure. The subsidiary IT interviewee cited problems with high costs and difficulties in getting local experts for global systems, and that the systems do not meet local requirements. The subsidiary business interviewees cited the problems with the main network hub in Japan. Overall, the subsidiary interviewees rated the Administrative approach they follow as satisfactory. COMPANY 6 IS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary is fairly decentralised. Even with directives coming from the headquarters and region, particularly on infrastructure, the subsidiary is very much involved in IS\/IT planning. Many IS developments were done and initiated by the subsidiary. The systems they developed won an award from the Malaysian government. These systems are not only used by the subsidiary but also by others in the region. Issues raised by the subsidiary include high IT cost of standard hardware and some implementation problems. The subsidiary felt that the Business\u2013led approach they follow is more than satisfactory. COMPANY 7 IS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary is well decentralised. The subsidiary decides almost everything related to the business and IS\/IT matters, apart from projects exceeding RM1 million ($US 300,000). Being on its own, the focus of IS planning is initiative and innovation. No issues were raised by the subsidiary IT Manager but the subsidiary business interviewees cited their concerns about long lead-times of IT projects and some miscellaneous technical issues. The subsidiary follows the Organisational approach for IS planning and rated this approach as more than satisfactory. COMPANY 8 IS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary is highly centralised. Directions come from the corporate headquarters in France, corporate regional office in China, and IT regional office in Australia. The focus of IS planning is to maximise scale economies through standard systems and infrastructure. Many issues were raised by the subsidiary, which include systems that do not match business needs, high cost of global systems, difficult to get local support for global systems, and some technical issues with the global systems. The approach of IS planning is evidently Administrative and to the subsidiary this approach is less than satisfactory. COMPANY 9 IS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary is highly centralised with directions coming from the corporate headquarters in the USA and the corporate regional office in Thailand. The IS Specialist, the only IT staff in the subsidiary, reports to the subsidiary Financial Controller. The focus of IS planning is to maximise scale economies. Many issues were raised by the subsidiary interviewees that include lack of authority to decide on IS\/IT, difficulties in getting budget, high expectation of local users, and technical issues. The approach of IS planning is plainly Administrative and the subsidiary views the approach as less than satisfactory.","cites":null},{"id":38077233,"title":"Entrepreneurship in multinational corporations: the characteristics of subsidiary initiatives.","authors":[],"date":"1997","doi":"10.1002\/(sici)1097-0266(199703)18:3<207::aid-smj864>3.0.co;2-q","raw":"Birkinshaw, J.M., 1997.

The research was carried out through\ninterviews with the IT and business managers in subsidiaries of nine large American,\nEuropean, and Japanese multinationals. The evidence from this study reveals that, in\nthe majority of these organisations, IS planning is either centralised or moving towards\ncentralisation. The main focus of IS planning, in many of these organisations, is to\ncontrol cost and achieve scale economies. As centralisation increases IT tends to\ncontrol the planning process and, as a result IS planning becomes more tactical than\nstrategic and is dominated by IT infrastructure planning. Project implementation was\nthe main criterion used to measure IS planning success, but due to the dominant role of\nIT, the subsidiary business managers are often less satisfied with the IS planning\napproach compared with the subsidiary IT managers. The level of involvement of\nbusiness managers and their satisfaction with ISSP was related to the degree of\ndecentralisation of responsibility for IS planning.\n1. Introduction\nEven though the field of Information Systems Strategic Planning (ISSP) has attracted\nmuch research since the 1970s (Nolan, 1979; Sullivan, 1985; Galliers, 1991 and 1993;\nEarl, 1993; Segars and Grover, 1998; Doherty et al., 1999) few studies have focused on\nmultinational organisations. Ives and Jarvenpaa (1991, p.34) noted that the IS research\ncommunity \u201chas generally neglected this important area\u201d whereas Deans and Ricks\n(1993, p.16) stated that \u201cuntil very recently there was a complete void in the available\nliterature\u201d pertaining to IS\/IT in multinationals. Since 1993 a number of studies\n(Jarvenpaa and Ives, 1994; Ramarapu and Lado, 1995; Viitanen, 1995, Roche, 1996;\nKing and Sethi, 1999; Manwani and O\u2019Keefe, 2003) have considered the particular\nissues of ISSP in multinationals, but largely from the corporate perspective. Only the\nresearch by Mirchandani and Lederer (2004), has, to date, approached the subject of\nISSP explicitly from the point of view of the subsidiaries.\nThe large number of empirical studies in multinationals, which relate to domains other\nthan information systems, shows that it is increasingly important to conduct studies in\nmultinationals, as entities distinct from single-nationals. For example, it was found that\nmultinationals develop their business strategies based on either the different levels of\nglobal integration and local responsiveness faced by these organisations (Prahalad and\nDoz, 1987; Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989), or on the global co-ordination and global\nconfiguration of different multinational units (Porter, 1985).\nAlthough it can be argued that a multinational environment, from IS\/IT standpoints, is\npurely an extension of a single-national environment, previous research has found that,\nfor instance, the technical and managerial issues in relation to IS\/IT faced by these\norganisations are not all the same (Tractinsky & Jarvenpaa, 1995). Deans and Ricks\n(1991, p.73) wrote, \u201cthe evidence clearly indicates that difficulties associated with\ninternational information systems go beyond those associated with distance alone\u201d,\n3while according to Akmanligil and Palvia (2004), \u201cclassifying global system\ndevelopment projects as simply larger versions of their domestic counterparts is an\noversimplification\u201d. IT managers in single-nationals were found to put more emphasis\non the interdependency and standardisation among different units whereas IT managers\nin multinationals emphasise the independence of different units in responding to their\nlocal environments (Tractinsky and Jarvenpaa, 1995).\nPrevious studies in multinationals have mainly focused on the multinational enterprise\nas the unit of analysis (Birkinshaw, 1994). However, not all subsidiaries in a given\nmultinational enterprise behave uniformly (Harzing, 2000; Martinez and Jarillo, 1991;\nGhoshal and Nohria, 1989). Martinez and Jarillo (1991) argued that as different\nsubsidiaries play different roles within the same multinational, the headquarters would\ntreat each subsidiary differently. Therefore, the authors noted, \u201cthe relationship between\nstrategy and mechanisms of coordination must be studied at the subsidiary level\u201d\n(p.433). Increasingly, research in multinationals is focusing on the subsidiaries\n(Birkinshaw, 1994; O\u2019Donnell, 2000; Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000).\nIn addition to different political, legal, economic, social, cultural, and technological\nenvironments, the complexity and risks involved in planning for IS\/IT in multinationals\ncan also be caused by resistance from foreign subsidiaries and the disparity of available\nIT solutions across the different countries (Ives et al., 1993). The different stages of\neconomic development of the countries in which the subsidiaries operate can create\nparticular issues for both local and corporate IS\/IT planning (Palvia et al., 2002).\nThe research described in this paper focused on ISSP from the perspective of\nmultinational subsidiaries. The main objectives of the research were to examine the\ndifferent approaches to ISSP, adopted by a range of multi-nationals and to understand\nthe extent to which these approaches were perceived to be effective by the managers in\nthose subsidiaries. The research involved interviews with the IT and business managers\nof nine large American, European and Japanese multinationals. The fieldwork for eight\nof the companies was conducted at their subsidiaries in Malaysia, the other at its\nsubsidiary in the UK. In addition, managers from four corporate headquarters were\ninterviewed in the USA, Switzerland, and The Netherlands.\nThe paper is divided into seven sections. Following this introduction, section 2 covers\nthe review of the extant literature. Section 3 describes the research methodology and\nselection of companies. The evidence from cross-company analysis is summarised in\nsection 4, and section 5 discusses the research findings and the implications before\ndrawing overall conclusions from the study in section 6.\n2. Literature Review\nThe literature review covers three main areas: IS strategic planning, IS planning in\nmultinationals, and IS planning success.\n4Information Systems Strategic Planning\nAccording to Boynton and Smud (1987, p.59), Information Systems Strategic Planning\n(ISSP) refers to the \u201cactivities directed toward (1) recognizing organizational\nopportunities for using information technology, (2) determining the resource\nrequirements to exploit these opportunities, (3) and developing strategies and action\nplans for realizing these opportunities and for meeting the resource needs\u201d. An IS\nstrategic plan, according to Earl (1989), refers to the \u201clong term, directional plan which\ndecides what to do with IT\u201d (p.67) that is concerned primarily with \u201caligning IS\ndevelopment with business needs and seeking advantage from IT\u201d (p.63). As noted by\nEarl (1993, p.7), an ISSP is made up of elements such as \u201cthe underpinning philosophy,\nemphasis, and influence \u2026 procedures, techniques, user-IS interactions, special\nanalysis, and random discoveries\u201d.\nMore recent conceptualisations of ISSP include \u201csupporting and influencing the\nstrategic direction of the firm through identification of value-adding computerized\ninformation systems, integrating and coordinating various organizational technologies\nthrough development of holistic information architectures, and developing general\nstrategies for successful systems applications\u201d (Segars et al. 1998, p.306) and \u201cthinking\nstrategically and planning for the effective long-term management and optimal impact\nof information in all its forms: information systems (IS) and information technology\n(IT) \u2026\u201d (Ward and Peppard, 2002, p.118). With the increasing diffusion of Internet-\nbased applications and inter-organisational systems, IS\/IT decisions are not limited to\nthe adopting organisations but are influenced by the actions of other organizations\n(Porter, 2001; Finnegan et al., 2003). To be able to plan in an environment which is\nincreasingly influenced by the emergent nature of inter-organisational business,\norganisations need to deal with various factors such as the different priorities and power\nof external stakeholders (Finnegan et al., 2003). Galliers (1999) suggested that ISSP\nframeworks need to be extended to include not only inter-organisational systems and e-\ncommerce, but also knowledge management.\nGiven that the research was to be conducted through interviews with business managers,\nthe definition of ISSP had to be one that they could understand and relate to the visible\nrole and contribution of IS\/IT to their businesses. The first definition quoted above by\nBoynton and Zmud (1987) was found to match most closely the perceptions of\npractising business and IT managers about the deployment of and the value derived\nfrom IS\/IT in their organisations.\nAn analysis of the literature suggests how approaches to ISSP have evolved over time as\nthe role and impact of IS\/IT has been extended and become increasingly integral not\nonly to business operations but also to the development and implementation of\norganisational strategies.\nWhen IT was first adopted during the 1960s and 1970s, the main purposes of\ninvestments were in improving clerical tasks and reducing administrative costs through\nbatch processing and office automation. Given the relative expense of the technology,\nIS\/IT planning was dominated by ensuring that efficiency gains would recover the costs\nof investments in infrastructure and application software (Nolan, 1979), Hence,\n5organisations sought better ways to systematically plan their investments in IS\/IT, and\nmethods for devising IS strategic plans by extending proven techniques for planning IS\ndevelopments were adopted, such as Business Systems Planning (Zachman, 1982).\nDuring the 1980s, organisations became aware of the importance of ensuring that the\nprocesses of IS\/IT and business planning were aligned to achieve greater integration of\nIS\/IT and business strategies.(King, 1978; Selig, 1982; Henderson and Sifonis, 1988;\nHenderson and Venkatraman, 1993; Das et al., 1991) McFarlan and McKenney (1983)\nwere among the first to highlight the need to plan an IS portfolio based on its current\nand future strategic impact, while Porter and Millar (1985) showed how IS\/IT could\nshape the overall business strategy and suggested steps that organisations could follow\nto maximise the strategic benefits achievable from IT. The main emphasis of this\napproach is a two-way strategic business-IS alignment, i.e. IS\/IT shapes the business\nstrategy as well as being shaped by the business strategy (Henderson and Venkatraman,\n1993). IS planning methods which have been used to align business requirements with\nIS\/IT development include Output-driven Planning (Li & Chen, 2001) and Triple Loop\nLearning (Finnegan et al., 2003).\nMore recently however, many studies have found that these approaches are insufficient\nin ensuring that IS\/IT plans can adapt to the increasingly rapid changes in both the\nbusiness environment and capabilities of the technology (Doherty et al., 1999; Grover\nand Segars, 2005). Earl (1993) and Ciborra (1994) argued that in order for business-IS\nintegration to be effective, organisations need to employ less formal or less structured\napproaches to ISSP. Systematic, standardised, and structured ISSP approaches do not\nencourage innovation, learning or knowledge sharing and they are unable to deal with\nthe grey zones of work practices, beliefs, values, routines and cultures that are important\nin formulating the IS strategy (Cibbora, 1994). Nor can they create IS capabilities that\nenable the development of new business strategies (Peppard and Ward, 2004). Segars et\nal. (1998) advocated a \u201crational adaptation\u201d approach for ISSP combining the need to\nhave a formal structure in IT planning with the need to adapt to change and learning.\nThe approaches to ISSP described by Earl (1993) and later re-examined and modified\nby Doherty et al. (1999), that summarise these different ways in which organisations\nformulate IS strategic plans, (Systematic, Administrative, Business-led and\nOrganisation-led) were used in this research to categorise the ways in which ISSP was\nconducted in the multinational subsidiaries studied.\nIS\/IT Planning in Multinationals\nAs discussed in the introduction, there has been little empirical research studying IS\nplanning in multinationals, particularly at the subsidiary level. For example, Selig\n(1982) investigated 25 US-based multinational headquarters, Jarvenpaa and Ives (1993)\nsurveyed 109 US-based multinational headquarters, Viitanen (1995 and 1998) reported\na study of a Japanese-based multinational headquarters, and King and Sethi (1999)\nsurveyed 143 US-based and 138 non-US-based multinational headquarters. Also, the\ndimensions studied were essentially the IT configurations rather than the IS related\nstrategic choices facing multinationals. A recent study by Mirchandani and Lederer\n(2004) considered a number of factors affecting the degree of ISSP autonomy in US\n6subsidiaries of multinationals, but none of the previous multinational IS\/IT studies\nattempted to establish a link between IS\/IT related strategic choices or orientations in\ndifferent types of IS planning approaches, nor did they attempt to assess the actual or\nperceived success of the planning process.\nFinnegan and Longaigh (2002), based on a review of the literature, discussed several\noperational and environmental factors that explain the need for different approaches to\nISSP in multinationals compared with single-nationals [Table 1]. It is suggested that\nthose factors in italics are particularly important when considering ISSP from the\nperspective of the subsidiaries, since they are those that are frequently mentioned in\nother studies of multinational subsidiaries (Ghoshal and Noria, 1989; Martinez and\nJarillo, 1991; Harzing, 2000; Palvia et al., 2002).\nOperational\n\uf0b7 Numerous product lines being produced by complex processes\n\uf0b7 Dispersed or concentrated value chain activities, with subsidiaries usually\nfocusing on parts of the value chain\n\uf0b7 The agency problem of balancing multinational interests with subsidiary\ninterests\n\uf0b7 Subsidiary unaware or unwilling to follow corporate objectives\n\uf0b7 Need to minimise undesired duplication and overlap\n\uf0b7 Incongruent mindsets in relation to work and expectations\n\uf0b7 Need to have continual rapid learning throughout the corporation applied to\ndispersed activities\nEnvironmental\n\uf0b7 Increased global competition\n\uf0b7 Geographical dispersion, linguistic differences and cultural diversity, which may\nshape subsidiary managers\u2019 decisions\n\uf0b7 Various host governments, inflicting different pressures\n\uf0b7 Instability of the international financial system\n\uf0b7 The need to be locally responsive and globally competitive\n\uf0b7 The need to be responsive to shifting comparative advantage\nTable 1: The operational and environmental factors of multinationals\nIn attempting to examine ISSP in multinational subsidiaries, there is a need to\nunderstand the dimensions that influence the relationship between a subsidiary and\nother units in the multinational. Following the work of Lawrence and Lorsch (1967),\nPorter (1986), Prahalad and Doz (1987), and Bartlett and Ghoshal (1989), much\nresearch in multinational subsidiaries has examined the extent of integration or co-\nordination of global activities across subsidiaries (business interdependency) and\ndegrees of localisation, differentiation, responsiveness and the configuration of different\nsubsidiaries (business distinctiveness).\nBusiness interdependency considers how dependent or interdependent are the main\nvalue-added activities of a particular subsidiary compared with the activities of the\nheadquarters and other foreign units. Business distinctiveness considers how diverse are\n7the activities of the local units in a multinational (Dunning, 1995) or how unique (or\nsimilar) are the value-added activities of a given subsidiary compared with the activities\nof other subsidiaries of the same multinational. In previous research, both these\ndimensions have been studied in terms of organisational processes (Prahalad and Doz,\n1987), cognitive frameworks (Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989), flows of capital, products,\nand knowledge (Gupta and Govindarajan, 1991), subsidiary autonomy, (Edwards et al.,\n2002), and IS\/IT configurations (Jarvenpaa and Ives, 1993; King and Sethi, 1999;\nManwani and O\u2019Keefe, 2003).\nBased on the review of the literature, three aspects of the ISSP orientations of the\nsubsidiaries seemed significant in terms of differentiating the nature of ISSP across\nsubsidiaries with different business orientations and relationships and hence were used\nto structure the research: (1) responsibility for ISSP, (2) the focus of ISSP, and (3) the\napproach used for ISSP.\nThe responsibility for ISSP has been widely studied in the IS\/IT literature (Boynton et\nal., 1992; Brown and Magill, 1994; Hodgkinson, 1996). Prior research has generally\nfocused on the allocation of IS\/IT decision rights between the IT function and the\nbusiness units. Previous studies found that centralised IT decision-making negatively\ninfluenced the sharing of knowledge between the IT and business IT units (Ranganathan\nand Sethi, 2002) and that a combination of centralised and decentralised responsibilities\nis a better balanced approach (Hodgkinson, 1996; von Simson, 1990). In this research,\nresponsibility for IS planning refers to the centralisation (headquarters-led) or\ndecentralisation (subsidiary-led) of major IS\/IT decisions and the roles of business and\nIT managers in those decisions. Interestingly, in their multinational strategy research,\nGhoshal et al. (1994) found no relationship between decision centralisation-\ndecentralisation and the quality of subsidiary-headquarters communication but Tsai\n(2002) identified that centralisation has a significant negative impact on knowledge\nsharing in multinationals.\nIn their survey of over 100 US based subsidiaries of multinationals, Mirchandani and\nLederer (2004) tested nine hypotheses to explain the degree of ISSP autonomy\n(decentralisation) enjoyed by the subsidiaries. The only hypothesis that was supported\nby the evidence was the extent of inter-company purchasing, which reduced the ISSP\nautonomy of the subsidiaries. This is an aspect of business interdependency considered\nabove. Two other hypotheses were contradicted by the evidence \u2013 both relate to the\ndegree of business distinctiveness, which does not increase the subsidiary autonomy as\nmight be expected. The six other hypotheses were not supported by the data.\nThe focus of ISSP refers to the driving forces that motivate a multinational to carry out\nthe IS\/IT planning and that shape the overall approach taken to ISSP. In the case of\nmultinationals, examples of the motivation for ISSP include: to enable the transfer of\nIS\/IT knowledge within the multinational group (Bresman, et al., 1999), to encourage\nthe subsidiaries\u2019 initiatives (Birkinshaw, 1999), to achieve economies of scale\nthroughout the multinational corporation, and to increase the co-operation and synergy\nbetween the different business units and the corporate headquarters. These factors may\nhave not yet been empirically studied in the IS\/IT field but are frequently discussed in\nthe multinational strategy literature. Birkinshaw (1999), for example, found that\n8subsidiary initiative was increased by the existence of distinctive subsidiary capabilities\nand suppressed by decision centralisation and a low level of global co-ordination.\nThe approach to ISSP can be considered in terms of the relationship with business\nplanning, the use of the specific IS planning techniques, and the role of managerial\ncontrol and organisational co-ordination mechanisms. These factors have been studied\nbefore in single-national organisations and typologies identified, but they have not\npreviously been adopted in studies of multinationals. The four different approaches\nidentified by Doherty et al. (1999), in an extensive survey, which built on the earlier\nempirically derived classification by Earl (1993), were used in this research to describe\nthe different approaches encountered in the organisations studied. The systematic\napproach emphasises the use of planning methodologies and the production of models;\nthe administrative approach focuses on financial and resource planning and allocation;\nthe business-led approach is based on creating explicit links between ISSP and\ncorporate plans and business initiatives and the organisational approach emphasises the\nimportance of achieving a consensus on future plans through processes of socialisation\nand learning.\nIS Planning Success\nAlthough considerable research has been conducted on the topic of the success or\neffectiveness of IS\/IT implementation (DeLone and McLean, 1992; Miller and Doyle,\n1987; Srinivasan, 1985), there has been far less research undertaken to examine the\nsuccess or effectiveness of IS\/IT planning. According to Fitzgerald (1993, p.337),\n\u201cjustification for evaluating the effectiveness of ISSP is noticeably absent in the IS\nplanning literature; however, it is addressed in the corporate planning literature\u201d.\nNevertheless the literature suggests several ways in which the measurement of ISSP\nsuccess could be operationalised. King (1988) proposed that ISSP success should be\nmeasured from a multi-dimensional, multi-stakeholder perspective, using a combination\nof internal and external \u2018benchmarks\u2019, and be based on both judgmental and objective\ncriteria.\nBased on the literature, the ways of measuring planning success can be classified into\nthree broader dimensions: planning efficiency, planning enrichment, and planning\neffectiveness.\nPlanning efficiency is input or resource-oriented and refers to the efficient use and\nmanagement of resources required for the IS\/IT planning process itself and the accurate\nforecasting of future IT resource requirements (King, 1988; Raghunathan and\nRaghunathan, 1989; Segars et al., 1998).\nPlanning enrichment is process-oriented and refers to the improvement, enhancement\nand fortification of the ISSP process, enabling it to be responsive to continuous changes\nin the business and IT environments, leading to the identification of innovative uses of\nIS\/IT and strategic applications (Lederer and Sethi, 1996; Doherty, et al., 1999;\nRaghunathan and Raghunathan, 1990; Ramanujam and Venkatraman, 1987; Reich and\nBenbasat, 1996; Segars and Grover, 1998; Segars et al., 1998). To achieve ongoing\nalignment and synchronisation with the evolving business strategy, the planning process\n9needs to emphasise the involvement of users and explicitly recognise the need for\norganisational learning (Reich and Benbasat, 2000).\nPlanning effectiveness refers to the assessment of the ISSP approach in meeting the\nintended goals for both the deployment of IS\/IT and the role of the IS\/IT function in the\norganisation (Doherty, et al., 1999; Ramanujam and Venkatraman, 1987; Reich and\nBenbasat 1996; Segars and Grover, 1998). According to the literature, intended ISSP\ngoals can include systems and infrastructure capability and reliability, payback or\ncontribution from IS\/IT investments, user satisfaction, and the degree of strategic\nalignment.\n3. Methodology\nThe research was conducted using field study methods (Galliers, 1992; Finnegan and\nLongaigh, 2002) and the main instrument used for collecting the evidence was semi-\nstructured interviews. The strength of this approach is that it focuses directly on the\nresearch topic, provides perceived causal inferences (Yin, 1994), and allows the\nresearchers to probe deeply to uncover new dimensions based on respondents\u2019 personal\nexperience (Burgess, 1982). With prior consent from the interviewees, all the interviews\nwere tape recorded, the tapes were transcribed and the texts transferred to QSR NVivo\nsoftware for analysis. In addition to the interviews and documents pertaining to the\ncompanies\u2019 background, few other corroborative documents were obtained from the\ncompanies, as most interviewees were concerned about corporate confidentiality.\nStructured interview guides were used to ensure that all the important issues and\ndimensions were covered during the interviews as well as to increase consistency across\ndifferent companies and interviewees. The same interview guides were used for both the\nsubsidiaries and the corporate headquarters. However, even though some background\ninformation of the IS\/IT and business operations of the headquarters were discussed\nduring the interviews with the headquarters, the focus of the interviews was more on the\nISSP related to foreign subsidiaries in general. The corporate interviewees were also\nasked to explain if and why their responses would be different for the subsidiaries\nstudied than other subsidiaries in general. Originally it was intended to interview\nmanagers at all the headquarters, but this was not able to be achieved within the\ntimescale available for the research.\nOverall, the interviews included the following areas:\n1. Background (Personal, Business, and IS\/IT)\n2. Business Orientation (Interdependency and Distinctiveness)\n3. IS\/IT Orientation (Responsibility for IS\/IT and Strategic Focus of IS\/IT)\n4. ISSP Approach (ISSP Objectives, ISSP Process, and ISSP Success Criteria)\n5. Perceived Success of ISSP\nAccess for the first company was obtained through the researchers\u2019 personal contacts\nwith the senior management of the company. This company was initially intended to be\na pilot case, to test and refine the research instrument. However, since no major change\nwas needed to the research instrument tested in the pilot study, other than some very\n10\nminor cosmetic changes, data from this company was included as part of the main\nstudy. The methodology used in this company was exactly the same as in the other\ncompanies. For access to other companies, an initial list of potential cases was obtained\nfrom the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority (MIDA): the Malaysian\ngovernment's principal agency for the promotion and co-ordination of foreign\ninvestments in the country. These companies were chosen based on their levels of\ninterdependency and distinctiveness, from information obtained from annual reports and\ninformation on the Internet.\nAltogether, nine companies were included in the study: four European (from the UK,\nThe Netherlands, France, and Switzerland), three US and two Japanese companies.\nThree of the companies operate in the electronics industry, two in the food and\nbeverages, and one each in machinery and equipment, financial, chemicals, and apparel\nand textiles. Four of the companies have a total group turnover for 2002 between US$1\nbillion and US$10 billion, two between US$10 billion and US$50 billion, and three\nbetween US$50 billion and US$100 billion. In terms of total group numbers of\nemployees for 2002, five companies have between 4,000 and 100,000 employees, two\nbetween 100,000 and 200,000, and two between 200,000 and 300,000. Table 2 provides\nbasic information about these companies and Appendix A contains a more detailed\nsummary of the business activities of the companies and their corresponding\nsubsidiaries.\nThe criteria adopted for selecting the interviewees included their roles in ISSP, their\nknowledge about the deployment of IS\/IT in the organisation, and their willingness to\nparticipate in the research. The interviewees were selected among the managers of the\nsubsidiary business units, such as the IT Directors, Managing Directors, Financial\nControllers, and senior Operations Managers. In addition to the fieldwork performed at\nthe nine subsidiaries, managers at four corporate headquarters were also interviewed,\nnot for the purpose of data collection as this would result in bias, but to provide views\nfrom the corporate headquarters to corroborate or otherwise the data collected in the\nsubsidiaries. Whenever there were variations between the views of the subsidiaries and\nthe headquarters, the views of the subsidiaries were used in the analysis and the\ndifferent views from the corporate headquarters noted and explained along side.\nFor confidentiality reasons, information that could lead to the identity of the\ninterviewees and their companies is not disclosed in this paper. The companies are\nidentified as Companies 1, 2, 3, etc. As also shown in Table 2, the study involved 37\ninterviewees representing the Subsidiary IT Unit (SIU), Subsidiary Business Unit\n(SBU), Headquarters IT Unit (HIU), and Headquarters Business Unit (HBU).\nCompany HomeCountry\nSubsidiary\nVisited\nPrimary\nIndustry\nInterviewees\nSIU SBU HIU HBU Total\nC1 Switzerland UK Machinery &Equipment 1 1 1 2 5\n11\nC2 USA Malaysia Financial 1 2 1 - 4\nC3 USA Malaysia Electronics 1 2 3 - 6\nC4 Netherlands Malaysia Chemicals 1 2 3 - 6\nC5 Japan Malaysia Electronics 1 3 - - 4\nC6 UK Malaysia Food andBeverages 1 2 - - 3\nC7 Japan Malaysia Apparel andTextiles 1 2 - - 3\nC8 France Malaysia Electronics 1 2 - - 3\nC9 USA Malaysia Food andBeverages 1 2 - - 3\nTotal 9 18 8 2 37\nTable 2: Overview of the companies\nAnalysis was performed using thematic content analysis, to identify the dimensions or\nissues that were most frequently cited and heavily stressed by the interviewees. Weber\n(1990, p.9) defined content analysis as \u201ca research methodology that utilizes a set of\nprocedures to make valid inferences from text\u201d and Patton (1990, p.391) defined it as\n\u201cthe process of identifying, coding, and categorizing the primary patterns in the data\u201d.\nOther than content analysis, the current research also used typology (Patton, 1990) and\nthematic conceptual matrix (Miles and Huberman, 1994) to analyse the evidence.\nThe analysis was carried out using the QSR NVivo software, which is designed to aid\nresearchers in analysing qualitative evidence through the processes of indexing,\nsearching, and theorising (Richards, 1999). Words and phrases that could be attached to\na particular topic, theme, or code were retrieved, brought together, and displayed in a\ntabular format. This enabled the evidence to be analysed in a more structured way and\nanalyses to be performed, first across all the interviewees for each company and later\nacross the different companies.\nThe data gathered from each interview were summarised according to the structure of\nthe interview guide and then these summaries consolidated for each company to elicit\ninitial findings, each of which was cross-referenced to the relevant evidence from each\nof the interviews. These initial findings were compared across the cases, for each of the\nmain research topic areas (ISSP responsibility, focus, objectives, process, success etc),\nto identify and synthesise those findings which were common across three or more of\nthe companies and which were based on supporting evidence from the majority, if not\nall interviewees in each company. Both stages of the analysis were first carried out\nindependently by both researchers, followed by rigorous comparative analysis of the\nseparate findings, when differences were reconciled, in an attempt to increase reliability.\n4. The analysis of the evidence from the companies\n12\nAs shown in Table 3, the companies could be classified into four groups, initially on the\nbalance of centralisation-decentralisation of IS planning, based on the degree of the\nsubsidiaries\u2019 autonomy in deciding the overall IS\/IT strategy, IS applications, IT\ninfrastructure, and IS\/IT budget. In centralised planning, all infrastructure and\napplications planning is done by the corporate headquarters while the subsidiaries only\nimplement these decisions. In the fairly centralised situation, although the decisions\nconcerning infrastructure and applications are made by the headquarters, these are\ngenerally made after consultation with the subsidiaries; fairly decentralised means that\nmajor decisions, especially those concerning applications, are made by the subsidiaries\nafter consultation with the headquarters. In decentralised planning, all investment\ndecisions are made by the subsidiaries and the corporate headquarters act as advisors.\nCompany\nSubsidiaries\u2019 Business\nOrientation Responsibility\nfor IS\nPlanning\nFocus\nof IS\nPlanning\nIS Planning\nApproach\nPerceived Success\nInterdependency Distinctiveness SubsidiaryIT\nSubsidiary\nBusiness\nC1 Low Low Decentralised SubsidiaryInitiative Organisational Successful Successful\nC7 Low High Decentralised SubsidiaryInitiative Organisational Successful\nMore than\nsatisfactory\nC6 High Low FairlyDecentralised\nGlobal\nCo-ordination Business Successful\nMore than\nsatisfactory\nC2 High Low FairlyCentralised\nScale\nEconomies Administrative\nMore than\nsatisfactory Satisfactory\nC3 High Low FairlyCentralised\nScale\nEconomies Administrative\nMore than\nsatisfactory Satisfactory\nC5 High Low FairlyCentralised\nScale\nEconomies Administrative Satisfactory Satisfactory\nC8 High Low Centralised ScaleEconomies Administrative\nLess than\nsatisfactory\nLess than\nsatisfactory\nC9 Low Low Centralised ScaleEconomies Administrative\nLess than\nsatisfactory\nLess than\nsatisfactory\nC4 High High Centralised ScaleEconomies Administrative\nLess than\nsatisfactory\nLess than\nsatisfactory\nTable 3: Summary of cross-company analysis\nTable 3 also includes an assessment of the degrees of subsidiary interdependency and\ndistinctiveness based on the agreed views of the subsidiary interviewees. This differed\nfrom the initial impression the researchers obtained from published information. In\nreality more of the subsidiaries proved to be lower in terms of distinctiveness and higher\nin terms of interdependency, but examples of the full range of options were still evident.\nEven though in this study we examined the relationship between each subsidiary\u2019s\nbusiness orientation (interdependency and distinctiveness) and IS\/IT planning, with\nsuch a small and biased sample, the evidence would not be sufficient to draw any\nconclusions about the relationship. The details are however included in the table to\nshow that in some cases the degree of centralisation of IS\/IT planning does not follow\n\u2018logically\u2019 from either dimension of the subsidiary\u2019s business orientation. Some\ninferences that can be drawn from the relationships about the orientations and the ISSP\napproaches are discussed later in the paper.\n13\nIn each group there is a relatively consistent pattern of relationships across the IS\nplanning responsibility, focus and approaches, rather than consistency across the types\nof subsidiary. The characteristics of the groups that emerged from this study are\nsummarised in Table 4. It is also clear from the pattern across all the subsidiaries that\nthe level of subsidiary management satisfaction with the results of IS planning are\nrelated to the extent to which it is decentralised.\nGroup 1 \u2013 Companies 1 and 7\nIn Company 1 and Company 7, IS planning is decentralised. The IT units for both\nsubsidiaries report directly to the subsidiaries\u2019 Managing Directors. Both subsidiaries\nfollow the Organisational approach while IS planning focuses mainly on allowing the\nsubsidiaries to be independent and innovative in planning and implementing the IS\/IT.\nCompared with most of the other companies included in this study, IS planning in\nCompanies 1 and 7 was perceived by the subsidiaries\u2019 interviewees to be the most\nsuccessful.\nGroup 2 \u2013 Company 6\nIS planning in Company 6 is fairly decentralised. Of all the nine companies studied,\nCompany 6 is the only subsidiary that follows the Business approach. The subsidiary IT\nunit reports directly to the Senior Manager of Operations. The main focus of IS\nplanning is to improve global co-operation. IS planning in Company 6 was perceived as\nsuccessful by the subsidiary\u2019s IS Manager and more than satisfactory by the\nsubsidiary\u2019s business interviewees.\nGroup 3 \u2013 Companies 2, 3 and 5\nIS planning in all the companies in this group is fairly centralised. The IT Manager for\nCompany 2 reports directly to manager of the business\u2019s service functions, Company 3\nto the subsidiary\u2019s Managing Director, and Company 5 to the subsidiary\u2019s Financial\nController. IS planning in all the three companies follows the Administrative approach\nand the main focus of IS planning is to control costs and streamline global activities\nthrough scale economies. Even though IS planning in these subsidiaries was perceived\nby the interviewees as satisfactory, the evidence also shows that, comparatively,\ninterviewees from Company 2 were more satisfied with the current approach, followed\nby Companies 3 and 5, in turn.\nGroup 4 \u2013 Companies 4, 8 and 9\nIn Company 4, 8, and 9, IS planning is highly centralised. The IT units in these\nsubsidiaries report directly to the subsidiaries\u2019 financial controllers. IS planning in all\nthe three companies is highly centralised and strictly follows the Administrative\napproach. The main focus of IS planning in these companies is to save costs through\nscale economies. IS planning was perceived by the subsidiaries\u2019 IT and business\ninterviewees as less than satisfactory.\nTable 4: Summary of the characteristics of the four groups\nThe discussion of the findings from the analysis of the evidence from the interviews is\nconsidered below under the main literature headings that were used to inform the study:\nresponsibility, focus and approach to ISSP.\nResponsibility for ISSP\n14\na) Increasing centralisation is the main trend in all the companies\nOnly two companies, Companies 1 and 7, have highly decentralised IS planning while\nCompany 6 is fairly decentralised. This would be expected in Company 7, which is high\non distinctiveness and low on interdependency but less so in the other two, especially\nCompany 6, which is now a marketing and distribution business only, but historically it\nalso manufactured products and enjoyed greater planning independence. This still exists\nto a degree, compared with other subsidiaries of the company. Similarly, Company 1 is\nthe largest and most profitable subsidiary and has been given more freedom to make its\nown IS\/IT investments than others. All the other companies are centralised at varying\ndegrees either at the corporate headquarters or regional offices.\nIn most of the companies, the current trend is towards more centralised IS planning. For\nexample, according to the subsidiary IT manager of Company 2, \u201cI think we are going\ntowards more centralisation\u201d and to the corporate IT manager of Company 3, \u201cNow we\nhave more centralised policies. By gathering input from everybody around the world\nthen you can get a centralised policy, that\u2019s what we have been doing.\u201d Similarly, IS\nplanning in Company 1, a decentralised Swiss organisation, is also moving towards\nmore centralised IS planning. The corporate CIO of Company 1 said, \u201cIt will change. It\nhas been decentralised \u2026 It is going the other way now, centralisation\u2026 sooner or later\nthey will join us\u201d. This is happening due to the manufacturing rationalisation\nprogramme and through the implementation of standard packaged software across the\ncorporation to integrate supply chains, i.e. it is largely for business reasons rather than\nIT.\nAlso, the trend to regionalise the IS planning in some of the organisations could mean\nmore decentralisation from the headquarters point of view, but more centralisation as far\nas the subsidiaries are concerned.\nb) There is little involvement of the local business management unless the\nresponsibility is decentralised.\nThere are generally three main types of co-ordination involved in a multinational IS\nplanning process: (1) vertical co-ordination from the subsidiaries to HQ, (2) horizontal\nco-ordination across the subsidiaries, and (3) cross domain co-ordination between IT\nand the business. In the 6 companies in Groups 3 and 4, co-ordination in relation to IS\nplanning is mainly between the subsidiaries\u2019 IT and corporate IT management. There\nare a lack of mechanisms to co-ordinate the IS plan across the subsidiaries\u2019 businesses,\neven though most of them are high on business interdependence and low on\ndistinctiveness. The study has also shown that in these companies there is very little co-\nordination between the corporate business and subsidiary business with regard to IS\/IT\nor IS\/IT planning. For example, as explained by the subsidiary IT Manager of Company\n8, \u201cThe worst part is that when the global business plan is done, the business and IT\npeople who sit inside the global planning committee may be depending on the other to\ninform those who report to them functionally through the dotted line. The business\nplanner would assume that IT has already informed the local subsidiary IT what to do.\nAt the same time the global IT would assume that the business people have already told\n15\nthe local subsidiary what to do. And then at the end they will come up with a very, very\nsophisticated plan that nobody knows how to do\u201d.\nIn contrast, according to the logistics manager of Company 7, where ISSP is highly\ndecentralised, \u201cI am involved in the project for the e-Business \u2026 I am totally involved in\nthe e-business design\u201d. The situation is similar in Companies 1 and 6, where in the past\nthey have been able to choose, customise or develop software that meets local market\nplace conditions. For example, Company 1 was the first in the group to implement\ninternet-based trading and CRM systems for its UK customers, and in the process\nincrease its market share and reduce its customer acquisition costs. Company 6 has been\nvery innovative in IS\/IT developments, leading to awards and funding from the\nMalaysian government as well as adoption of the systems by other group subsidiaries in\nthe region.\nc) IS planning is dominated by IT in all but three of the companies \u2013 the more\ncentralised planning becomes the more IT dominates the process.\nOther than in the companies in Group 1 and 2, IS planning is mainly dominated by IT,\nthe supply side, rather than IS, the demand side. This finding relates closely with the\nprevious one in terms of the involvement of business managers. The focus is more on\nwhat kind of IT the corporate headquarters would offer rather than the IS the local\nbusiness really needs. The emphasis is more on how to control IT costs and reduce\nproblems due to the lack of systems integration or duplication than aligning the IS with\nthe business requirements in order to gain and sustain competitive advantage.\nThe study has shown that in all nine companies, the subsidiaries\u2019 autonomy has always\nbeen lower in terms of determining the IT architecture compared with IS applications.\nThe focus on IT in the planning was clearly evident from responses received during the\ninterviews. In fact, in almost all of the subsidiaries, particularly those with a higher\ndegree of centralisation, IS\/IT planning largely revolves around planning for the IT\ninfrastructure. According to the subsidiary IT manager of Company 2, \u201cI would not be\nable to say that there is a company-wide, strategic, long-term plan for systems, at least\nnot on the applications. But for the infrastructure, our long-term plan is to come up with\na common infrastructure platform and global products that we use, as far as possible,\nto leverage on the support.\u201d In Company 8, there was expressed concern by all\ninterviewees that the systems \u2018imposed\u2019 from the centre were not only failing to meet\nthe local business needs and but were also adding unnecessary costs to the business.\nIn contrast, according to the IS manager of Company 1, \u201cFor information systems\nplanning, I have the full responsibility of making the recommendations to the top\nmanagement of directions \u2026 my responsibility is to make sure that information systems\nare kept up to date, well maintained, to make sure that they are even able to create new\nbusiness.\u201d In Company 7 there is considerable financial discretion to invest in IS\/IT \u2013 it\nonly has to obtain corporate approval for investments over \u00a3200,000.\n16\nIn summary, the evidence from these companies shows that the location of\nresponsibility for ISSP has a significant influence on the extent to which subsidiaries\u2019\nbusiness managers become involved and this in turn affects the ability of the subsidiary\nto match its IS to the local business situation or use IT innovatively. The overall trend to\ngreater centralisation suggests that this discretion is likely to reduce in future. Given the\ndifferent levels of subsidiary management satisfaction expressed, it would be expected\nthat they will become less satisfied if this trend continues.\nFocus of ISSP\nThe literature suggests that the focus of IS planning can emphasise maximising scale\neconomies, encouraging subsidiaries\u2019 initiatives, improving global co-operation, and\ntransferring IS\/IT knowledge.\na) The focus in the majority of companies is on cost control and scale economies\nThe study has revealed that, for companies in Groups 3 and 4, the main focus or\nmotivation for IS planning is largely to control costs through scale economies. In most\ncases, the main objective of IS plans for the subsidiary IT unit is to obtain the financial\nbudget or to prioritise IT projects. Time and again the IT interviewees raised the issue of\nmaximising scale economies and reducing IT costs as the main focus of IS planning and\nIS\/IT function. For example, when asked what influences the IS planning most, the\nsubsidiary financial controller of Company 9 simply replied, \u201cMoney\u201d, and the\nsubsidiary IT manager of Company 5 replied, \u201cBudget\u201d.\nOut of the nine companies studied, six companies (Companies 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9) have\nmaximising scale economies as the main focus of IS planning, leaving only Companies\n1 and 7, which focused on subsidiary initiatives, and Company 6, on global co-\noperation. Not unexpectedly, the more decentralised subsidiaries tend to focus on\nsubsidiary initiatives while the more centralised organisations focus on scale economies.\nFor example, as commented by the corporate IT manager of company 3, \u201cManaging\ncost is a priority with us all the time. Regardless of what it is, we have to keep our costs\nunder control and drop the cost down\u201d and by the subsidiary maintenance manager of\nCompany 4, \u201cWe want to do a lot of things but are constrained on money, so there has\nto be a balance. At the end of the day we have to look at our pockets.\u201d\nIn contrast, according to the IT manager of Company 6, \u201cI estimated that the system\nwould cost me RM300000 over. I can justify it. If you put in an accountant they will be\nchucked out. But I would take a very strategic view of what I want to do, and I have a\ncompany which is going to listen to me and agree that it is a strategy and let\u2019s go and\ndo it.\u201d\nb) There is almost no focus on promoting knowledge transfer in any of the\ncompanies\nInnovation, learning, and adaptation are among the potential strategic objectives of\nmultinationals whereas shared learning across organisational components in different\nproducts, markets, or business is one of the potential sources of competitive advantage\n17\nfor these companies (Ghoshal, 1987). However, the study has indicated that IS planning\nin all of these companies has very little concern with these capabilities: for example\naccording to the subsidiary IT Director of Company 2, \u201cwith the centralization\nbasically there is no need for in-depth knowledge transfer\u201d and according to the IT\nManager of Company 5, \u201cIf you are referring to technical knowledge, it is not\nimportant\u201d.\nEven though many of the other subsidiary interviewees acknowledged the potential\nbenefits of transferring knowledge within the group, this has not been the focus of the\ncurrent IS\/IT planning. Knowledge transfer is not something that is actually planned but\nis an outcome of the planning process. According to the IT manager of Company 8, \u201cI\nwould say transfer of knowledge is very important to me but the people who implement\nthe project [the central IT] sometimes think otherwise \u2026 Of course at our end we\ndefinitely want them to transfer the knowledge because once we know everything the\ncompany [the subsidiary] doesn\u2019t have to spend so much money to engage these\npeople.\u201d\nIt would appear that greater centralisation of ISSP would facilitate knowledge transfer,\nboth across the IT staff and potentially across the businesses. However there is no\nevidence from these companies that this happens, perhaps due the very strong emphasis\non scale economies rather than strategic uses of IS\/IT.\nIn summary, the focus of ISSP seems to be determined more by the way in which IS\/IT\nis structured in the organisation and the resulting responsibility for ISSP, in terms of\ncentralisation or decentralisation, rather than by the business demand for investment in\nIS\/IT to achieve business advantages within and across subsidiaries.\nIS Planning Approaches\nAs discussed earlier, for the purposes of this research these were classified based on the\nwork of Earl (1993) and Doherty et al. (1999) into four distinct types: Administrative,\nBusiness, Organisational, and Systematic. As shown in Table 3, six subsidiaries follow\nthe Administrative approach, two the Organisational approach, and only one the\nBusiness approach.\na) Alignment between IS and business strategy is related to the balance of\ncentralisation \u2013decentralisation of IS planning\nNone of the companies uses a specific methodology to link the business strategy with\nthe IS and IT strategies. However according to a study by Chan (2002), IS\/IT and\nbusiness strategy alignment is as dependent on the \u2018informal\u2019 relationships between\nbusiness and IT managers as on formal processes and organisation structures. In\ncompanies in Groups 1 and 2 (see Table 4) business managers are involved in IS\nplanning in the subsidiary. For example, according to the managing director of\nCompany 1, \u201cThe basic strategy is using IT in the marketing way to integrate ourselves\n18\nand the customers \u2026 IT has been used in that particular aspect as a tool to make sure\nthat we can complete the business plan\u201d.\nIn contrast, in Group 3 and 4 companies, not only is there little involvement of business\nmanagers in ISSP, as discussed earlier, none of the subsidiary IT managers of\ncompanies in Groups 3 and 4 is involved in the development or formulation of the\nbusiness strategy and some of them even have no access to such plans. According to the\nproduction planning manager of Company 9, \u201cThe way that we are handling or using\nthe software planned by our corporate headquarters \u2026 we need to suit our\nrequirements with the available systems, not the other way around\u201d. Similarly managers\nin company 3 were concerned that the enforced adoption of global systems meant their\nlocal business needs were being ignored. As discussed earlier, in many of these\ncompanies, there is no mechanism that links the subsidiary and corporate business\nmanagement with regard to ISSP.\nAs would be expected the more decentralised subsidiaries tend to follow the\nOrganisational or Business approaches, which as prior research suggests should lead to\ngreater alignment. This was the case. All the more centralised subsidiaries follow the\nAdministrative approach, where ensuring adequate financial control of subsidiaries\u2019\ninvestments is the main purpose of planning in order to achieve overall economies of\nscale for the corporation. In four of the six companies following the Administrative\napproach, IT reported to the Financial Controller in the subsidiary. In three of these the\nbusiness and IT managers both described the outcome regarding ISSP as unsatisfactory.\nb) IS planning is more tactical than strategic in all the companies studied\nEven though previous surveys (Galliers et al., 1994; Brancheau et al., 1996; Watson et\nal., 1997) have indicated that IS strategic planning has been one of the most important\nissues facing practitioners, there was very little evidence the way IS planning is carried\nout in these particular companies is strategic. For example, according to the subsidiary\nfinancial controller of Company 8, \u201cWe don\u2019t have people doing either strategic\nplanning or IT planning\u201d. Also, according to the subsidiary IT Director of company 2,\n\u201cI would not be able to say that there is a strategic long term plan for systems, at least\nnot on the applications\u201d and according to the corporate VP of IT Services of Company\n3, \u201cthat is probably one of the weaknesses of our process because most of our planning\nis fairly tactical\u201d.\nThe fact that IS planning in these subsidiaries is more tactical, more short-term, and\nmore internally oriented is evident from the main responsibilities of the local IT\nmanagers and the nature of the planning they carry out at the subsidiaries. According to\nthe subsidiary IT manager of Company 8, \u201cMost of the projects are driven down from\nthe corporate head office. Basically our responsibility as the project manager is to try\nto push the project and implement it successfully in the subsidiary\u201d. Corporate\ninterviewees also noted that subsidiaries are only responsible for IT operations rather\nthan IS planning. According to the corporate CIO of Company 4, \u201cSite IT managers are\njust running the operation. There are no development activities at sites \u2026 sites are not\nautonomous, they just execute\u201d.\n19\nIn summary, for the majority of the companies studied it appears that strategic\nalignment or competitive use of IS\/IT was less important than controlling costs and the\napproach adopted emphasised this priority. However it can be also argued that the way\nthat IT is structured and organised in these organisations, places the emphasis on\nmanaging supply rather than on responding to business priorities or creating business\nadvantages from IS\/IT. This causes the more tactical planning emphasis even in\nsubsidiaries that have greater autonomy in other business planning, due to their levels of\ndistinctiveness and interdependence.\nPerceived Success of IS Planning\nThe levels of IS planning success, as perceived by the subsidiaries were classified as:\nsuccessful, more than satisfactory, satisfactory, and less than satisfactory, based on\ncriteria previously used by Caldeira and Ward (2003), derived from the earlier work of\nEarl (1993). The study found that none of the companies used any formal criteria to\nmeasure IS planning success. However, using generic criteria from the literature, the\nstudy found that IS planning is perceived by the IT management in the subsidiary as\nsuccessful by three subsidiaries, more than satisfactory by two subsidiaries, satisfactory\nby one subsidiary and less than satisfactory by three subsidiaries.\nBusiness managers in general agreed with the IT management, but where they differed,\nthey always rated the success to be lower, even in the two of the companies where ISSP\nwas relatively decentralised. For example, in Company 2, the subsidiary IT manager\nbelieved the approach of IS planning was more than satisfactory when she said, \u201cMost\nof the pre-plan things we do meet the target, we keep to it, we deliver \u201d, but according to\nthe subsidiary e-Business Manager, \u201cI guess I would say satisfactory. It could be\nimproved\u201d. Similarly, in Company 7, the subsidiary IT manager believed it was\nsuccessful but, as said by the subsidiary logistics manager, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rate it as\nsuccessful. In a way it was successful but it was not implemented within the timeframe\u201d.\nOverall both IT and business managers judged IS planning to be more successful in the\ncompanies where planning and decision making were decentralised or fairly\ndecentralised.\na) Project implementation is the main criterion used to assess IS planning success\nin all the companies\nMost of the interviewees indicated that they informally used planning effectiveness,\nsuch as successful implementation, performance of the systems, user acceptance and\nsatisfaction, meeting project deadlines, and meeting allocated budget, to measure the\nsuccess of IS planning. For example, according to the subsidiary IT manager of\nCompany 1, \u201cWe don\u2019t measure what criteria we will use to view ourselves as\nsuccessful against. We don\u2019t formally do it \u2026 In terms of the major system migrations,\nif 80% of its main business processes are functioning, then that is a reasonably\nsuccessful project.\u201d Even though several interviewees indicated that the strategic focus\nof IS planning is to improve co-operation and synergy between different global units,\ni.e. planning enrichment, this is not an important criterion for judging the success or\nfailure of the planning. Planning enrichment as a criterion was quoted by the subsidiary\nIT Manager of Company 5, \u201cAchievement \u2026 Effort, because the benefit is not so big but\n20\nyou have to put in a lot of effort to make this. So, at least you encourage some to\nchallenge the new things. Some is technically very difficult. I think they need to keep on\nchallenging the new things\u201d. This is consistent with the findings of the study by\nNewkirk et al. (2003), who noted \u201cthe failure to implement is common and the lack of\nimplementation often leaves firms very dissatisfied with their SISP [Strategic\nInformation Systems Planning] efforts\u201d (p.222).\nIn summary, it is not surprising that in those subsidiaries where business managers were\ninvolved in ISSP, they deemed it to be more successful. In the others there were\nfrequently raised concerns that the systems they had to use did not meet the local\nbusiness needs, even if they were successfully implemented. Often the high costs of the\ncorporate solutions increased this dissatisfaction, many interviewees felt they could\nimplement better systems at lower cost, given more autonomy in IS\/IT decisions. This\nseems to be a contradictory outcome of the focus in all these companies of achieving\nscale economies through centralised ISSP and strict financial control of investments.\nAppendix B summarises these aspects of IS planning in each of the companies.\n5. Discussion of the findings\nThe findings indicate that the business orientation of the subsidiary, as defined by its\ndistinctiveness and interdependency, does influence both the responsibility for and\nfocus of IS planning. However, with a sample of only nine cases, which is also not a\nbalanced sample across the four different types and in four of which the ISSP approach\nwas inconsistent with the business orientation, it is not possible to conclude that\nbusiness orientation is the most important influence on ISSP. It could be predicted from\nprevious research that four out of five subsidiaries that have a high degree of\ninterdependency but low distinctiveness (Companies 2, 3, 5, 8) follow a more\ncentralised approach of ISSP and focus on scale economies. Equally, Company 7, with\nhigh distinctiveness and low interdependency could be expected to have decentralised\nISSP. This supports earlier findings by King and Sethi (1999). The same relationship\nbetween high interdependency and low levels of subsidiary autonomy was also found in\na study of Malaysian subsidiaries by Edwards et al. (2002). However, they found that a\nhigh degree of business distinctiveness is not related to a high degree of business\nautonomy, unlike the situation in company 7.\nIn each of the four companies that do not fit the predicted pattern, this can at least in\npart be explained by reasons that are not specifically related to business or IS strategy.\nCompany 6, which also has high business interdependency and low business\ndistinctiveness, follows a fairly decentralised approach of ISSP. Unlike other\nsubsidiaries mentioned above, Company 6 had, in the past, been acknowledged for\nsuccess in developing innovative IT products and won several awards from the\ngovernment for its IT innovations. Also, Company 4, which has high interdependency\nand high distinctiveness, though predicted to follow a fairly decentralised ISSP, follows\na centralised ISSP approach. Based on the evidence gathered from the corporate\nheadquarters, it was found that the company follows a centralised ISSP approach for all\nsmall subsidiaries including Company 4, which is one of the smallest subsidiaries\n21\nwithin the group. This is also the case in Company 9, which again is one of the smaller\nsubsidiaries and, although it has low interdependency, it has no discretion concerning its\nIS applications. It has to adopt the corporate standard applications, even though these\nare expensive and add cost to the business. In Companies 4 and 9 both IT and business\nmanagers believe their information systems do not meet their business needs and are not\nsatisfactory. Conversely Company 1 is the largest, and most profitable, subsidiary in the\ncorporation outside Switzerland and hence it enjoys degrees of autonomy in ISSP, not\nshared by other subsidiaries.\nIS planning in the majority of multinationals studied was found to be focused more on\nplanning for a tactical short-term IT as a utility rather than a long-term strategic IS as a\nsource of competitive advantage. IT is viewed as a utility that is necessary in order to\nenable each individual unit to conduct its business effectively and for the whole\nenterprise to integrate the global activities efficiently. As a utility, IT is seen as a cost or\na necessary expenditure to be controlled, rather than as a strategic investment. As Lai\n(2001) wrote, \u201ctechnical issues are more important determinants of IS decisions than are\nmanagement issues \u2026 IT infrastructure, information architecture, data utilization and\ntechnology integration are significant IIM [International Information Management]\nissues at all three decision levels [operational, tactical, and strategic levels]\u201d (p.263).\nThis is reflected in six of the companies studied, where in reality there is little IS\nplanning at the subsidiary level and planning is largely dominated by the corporate IT\norganisation, which would explain the focus of planning on achieving scale economies.\nIS planning in these companies is becoming increasingly centralised with more\ndecisions made by the corporate headquarters or regional offices. Even in subsidiaries\nwhere IS planning is currently decentralised, i.e. Companies 1, 6 and 7, there is a steady\nattempt from the corporate headquarters to recentralise it. In the literature, Jarvenpaa\nand Ives (1993, p.568) wrote, \u201cdecentralised firms will tend towards more centralised IT\nwhen facing pressures for economies of scale in IT\u201d. Also, as noted by Peppard (1999),\nadvantages of the \u201cheadquarters-driven global IS\/IT\u201d structure include the ability to\nmaximise scale economies and to control standards. While this argument appears to\njustify central planning of infrastructure, it is also being used to increase the central\nplanning of applications, in spite of the expressed dissatisfaction of many of the\nsubsidiaries with the outcome. The evidence from these companies is that, although\ncentralised IS planning may increase efficiency and scale economies it reduces the\nlevels of subsidiary initiatives, as would be expected, and also knowledge transfer.\nThese it can be argued provide at least a partial explanation of why the level of\nsatisfaction with IS in the subsidiaries studied is inversely correlated with the degree of\ncentralisation.\nPrevious research has produced conflicting views about the influence of centralisation\non both the degree of subsidiary initiative and the extent of transfer of knowledge that\nresults.\nAs would be expected, the evidence revealed that the focus on subsidiary initiatives is\nlow in centralised companies and high in decentralised companies. This is consistent\nwith the findings from the studies conducted by Birkinshaw (1997) and Birkinshaw et\nal. (1998). Birkinshaw (1997) wrote that, \u201cthe importance of autonomy was underlined\n22\nby one company in which the subsidiary had achieved great success in building a viable\ninternational business, but where the parent company had then curtailed its autonomy\nbecause corporate difficulties - pursuing initiatives suddenly became a time-consuming\nand frustrating process\u201d (p.219). However, earlier, Ghoshal and Bartlett (1988) found\nthat there was no relationship between subsidiary autonomy and subsidiary innovation.\nLittle emphasis was given to enabling global transfer of knowledge (Ghoshal, 1987) in\nany of the companies studied, even in Company 6, where the focus of ISSP was on\nglobal co-ordination. In a study involving European and US companies, Ruggles (1998)\nfound that only 13% of the respondents rated the ability to transfer knowledge within\ntheir organisations as good or excellent. Ranganathan and Sethi (2002) and Tsai (2002),\nfound that a centralised IT structure negatively influenced the sharing of knowledge\nbetween the business and IT units and between the multinational headquarters and\nsubsidiaries. Quite the opposite, Gupta and Govindarajan (2000) found that knowledge\ninflows are higher in the case of \u201csubsidiaries that are integrated more tightly with the\nrest of the corporation through formal mechanisms\u201d (p.488).\n6. Summary and Conclusions\nThe objectives of this research were to examine the different approaches to ISSP,\nadopted by different types of multinational subsidiary and understand the extent to\nwhich these approaches were perceived to be effective.\nThe research shows that it is possible to distinguish different ISSP orientations in terms\nof strategic focus, responsibility and approaches to ISSP and that in many instances\nthese are primarily influenced by the business orientation. The main conclusions that\ncan be drawn from evidence gathered from the companies studied in this research are:\n1. Responsibility for ISSP is increasingly being centralised even in subsidiaries that\nhave traditionally enjoyed greater autonomy in ISSP and continue to have more\nautonomy in other areas of business planning. As responsibility is centralised, the\ninvolvement of subsidiary business managers in ISSP reduces and planning either\nfocuses on IT alone or IT management increasingly determine the IS plans. The\noutcome of this, as evident from this study, is that local business requirements are not\nbeing adequately addressed. This is the main reason why, in five of the companies, the\nsubsidiary business managers interviewed were less satisfied with the IS planning\napproach compared with their IT colleagues.\n2. The focus of ISSP in the majority of the companies studied was on controlling costs\nand achieving scale economies. Only in three companies was there agreed to be close\nalignment between business and IS\/IT strategy at the subsidiary level. In these\ncompanies, the focus was on subsidiary initiative or global co-ordination and\nresponsibility for ISSP was relatively decentralised. Subsidiary business managers were\ninvolved in the process of planning, and in these three companies ISSP was judged to be\nmore than satisfactory or successful, by both business and IT managers.\n23\n3. The approaches to ISSP are influenced more by the degree of organisational\ncentralisation of IS\/IT planning and control, rather than the needs of the subsidiary in\nterms of its distinctiveness or level of interdependency, or the opportunities for utilising\nIS\/IT to achieve an improved competitive position for the subsidiary in its environment.\n4. Given that \u2018project implementation\u2019 was the main success criteria used, in all the\ncompanies, the assessment of planning success is likely to have been significantly\ninfluenced by the success or otherwise of systems implementations. The consistency of\nthe evidence from these companies suggests that a lack of IS\/IT and business strategy\nalignment at the subsidiary level is a cause of the dissatisfaction at the implementation\nstage.\nThe findings from this research, suggest that in many multinationals, including all those\nin this study, the conceptualisation of ISSP is often defined more by the operational than\nthe environmental factors identified by Finnegan and Longaigh (2002) and shown in\nTable 1. For example, at the subsidiary level the emphasis on the need to be responsive\nand competitive within the local market is important to local management, but is often\nof secondary importance to the multinational\u2019s global business and IS\/IT priorities and\nthe corporate desire to minimise the costs associated with duplication and overlap.\nAgain, ensuring that the subsidiary is efficient in carrying out its value chain activities is\nusually seen as more important than dealing with aspects associated with geographical\ndispersion.\nThe main findings from this work are also likely to be seen as relevant and useful by\npractitioners, especially IS\/IT managers in both multinational subsidiaries and corporate\nheadquarters. They provide some explanations of the factors influencing the scope and\ndegrees of discretion that different types of subsidiary have regarding ISSP and the\nimplications for the business satisfaction with IS\/IT. In turn this may enable managers\nto change some aspects of the approach to ISSP to improve the subsidiaries\u2019 satisfaction\nwith the outcome. Some suggestions that would appear relevant to many organisations\nare:\n1. Even if centralisation yields significant corporate benefits and reduced costs, it does\nnot imply that business managers in the subsidiaries should not be actively engaged in\nIS planning, both to input their needs and to have some influence over decisions that\ncould affect their subsidiary\u2019s performance. Increasing centralisation of IS\/IT should not\nresult in subsidiaries becoming less competitive, especially when initiatives by\nsubsidiary managers to increase competitiveness are expected in other activities, such as\nmarketing or service development.\n2. Equally the adverse perceptions of IS planning by subsidiary business managers\ncould impede the implementation of global strategies. Earlier and more consistent\ninvolvement of local business and IS\/IT management in the planning of global projects\nmight increase the commitment to successful implementation in the subsidiaries.\n3. The perceived benefits of IS in the most of the subsidiaries result from operational\nimprovements, yet there seems little encouragement and few mechanisms to share IS\/IT\nknowledge across subsidiaries in most of the organisations studied. Facilitating\n24\nmanagers to learn how those benefits can be achieved from colleagues in other\nsubsidiaries might enable benefits to be replicated and also avoid costs being duplicated,\nwhich are two of the reasons often given to justify greater centralisation.\nResearch Limitations\nThe difficulty in generalising the findings has been one of the criticisms of case study\nresearch, compared with quantitative studies. According to Yin (1994), generalisation in\nthe case study research is achieved through analytical generalisation rather than\nstatistical generalisation. Analytical generalisation is context-specific. The evidence\ngathered in this research may be biased towards small subsidiaries of large\nmultinationals. However, by including the business orientation framework, which has\npreviously been used in quantitative studies in different contexts, it is possible to build\non the findings from prior work, either to support those conclusions or develop further\ninsights into aspects of multinational strategies not previously studied. By applying the\nframework to the IS\/IT domain, this research shows that although the planning of IS\/IT\nis influenced by the business orientation, it is not sufficient to explain the ISSP\norientation in many of the companies studied.\nWhile maintaining the level of rigour necessary in conducting this research, another\nimportant aim was to ensure that the outcome of this research is relevant to practice.\nRelevance implies \u201cdemonstrating a meaningfulness regarding its application to the\nsignificant problems and opportunities being faced by today's organizations and their\nmembers\u201d (Zmud, 1996, p.xxxvii). Relevance was enhanced in this research by the use\nof interviews, which gave the interviewees opportunities to describe the IS planning\nissues and approaches openly and not be restricted by structured questionnaires.\nOpportunities for Further Research\nWe attempted to examine the relationship between subsidiary business interdependency\nand distinctiveness and ISSP approach. However, since we had only nine cases and five\nof these cases were concentrated in one particular category (high business\ninterdependency and low business distinctiveness), we could not draw firm conclusions\nbased on this categorisation. More cases or samples need to be included in future\nresearch to examine this interesting relationship between business orientation and ISSP.\nThe evidence gathered from the corporate interviewees revealed that the corporate\nheadquarters do treat their subsidiaries in different ways. For example, the corporate\nCIO of Company 4 quoted that even though IS planning in its Malaysian subsidiary is\nhighly centralised, IS planning in its US subsidiary is decentralised. The reason given\nwas that the US subsidiary is the biggest subsidiary within the group. Future research\ncan examine IS planning in different multinational subsidiaries belonging to a particular\nmultinational in order to examine the effect of subsidiary size or other characteristics on\nthe IS planning approach. (It should be noted that the survey by Mirchandani and\nLederer (2004) found no correlation between subsidiary size and the subsidiaries\u2019\ndegrees of ISSP autonomy.)\n25\nEven though the issues related to different national cultures were explored during this\nresearch, none of the respondents believed them to be important. Furthermore, it was\nnot the aim of this research to focus on national cultures as almost all the subsidiaries\noperate in the same country. In a more diverse sample, culture might well emerge as an\ninfluencing factor. Also different corporate cultures could potentially affect both the\nnature of the approach to ISSP and the corporate-subsidiary management relationships,\nbut these were not studied in this research. The lack of comments on cultural issues may\nalso, in part, be explained by the predominantly operational and technical rather than\nstrategic focus of ISSP in the organisations studied. However, if future research\nconducted in subsidiaries could specifically explore this issue, it would further our\nunderstanding of the IS planning and management in multinationals, since culture has\nbeen found to affect other business domains of multinationals, such as research and\ndevelopment (Jones and Teegen, 2001), human resources performance measurement\n(Lindholm, 2000), and financial performance (Newman and Nollen, 1996).\nFinally, further studies which were able to specifically compare and contrast\norganisations where similar global IS\/IT strategies resulted in different levels of success\nboth corporately and across different subsidiaries, would confirm or otherwise the\npractical value of our suggestions, at the end of the previous section, for achieving more\neffective IS\/IT management in a multinational environment.\nReferences\nAkmanligil, M., Palvia, P.C., 2004.

The major\nbusiness activities of the subsidiary\ninclude manufacturing, sales and\nmarketing of piping systems. The study\nwas focused on its subsidiary in the UK\nbut interviews and sites visited also\ncovered the HQ in Switzerland.\nCOMPANY 2\nCompany 2 is a US-based multinational\nclassified under the financial industry.\nThe study was focused on its subsidiary\nin Malaysia but a telephone interview\nwas also held with its CIO in the USA.\nThe main activities of the subsidiary\ninvolve commercial and investment\nbanking activities.\nCOMPANY 3\nCompany 3 is a US-based multinational\nclassified in the electronics industry.\nThe study was focused on its subsidiary\nin Malaysia but interviews and site visits\nalso covered three senior IT\ninterviewees in its headquarters in the\nUSA. The main business activities of the\nsubsidiary involve assembly and testing\nof semiconductor components produced\nby other subsidiaries of the\nmultinational.\nCOMPANY 4\nCompany 4 is a large multinational\nbased in The Netherlands. The company\nis classified under the chemicals\nindustry. The study was focused on its\nsubsidiary in Malaysia but also involved\na site visit and interview with its\ncorporate CIO in The Netherlands. The\nmain activities of the subsidiary involve\nmanufacturing of soap noodles using\noleo-chemicals.\nCOMPANY 5\nCompany 5 is a Japanese multinational\nand one of the largest companies\nclassified under the electronics industry.\nThe study was focused on one of its\nsubsidiaries in Malaysia, which is also\none of the major subsidiaries of the\ngroup. The business operations of the\nsubsidiary involve manufacturing of\nvideos and colour televisions. Most of\nthe products are exported through the\ncompany\u2019s sales distributor\nCOMPANY 6\nCompany 6 is a large UK-based\nmultinational classified under the food\nand beverages industry. Its principal\nactivities include manufacture and\nsupply of foods, household care, and\npersonal products. The study was\nfocused on its subsidiary in Malaysia.\nSince the subsidiary phased out its\nmanufacturing activities a few years\nago, its main activities now involve\nsales and distribution of products\nmanufactured by other sister companies.\nCOMPANY 7\nCompany 7 is a large and diversified\nJapanese multinational classified under\nthe apparel and textiles industry. The\ncompany started its operations in\nMalaysia in the early 1970s and now is\nmade up of seven companies. The main\nactivities of the Malaysian group include\nproduction of polyester staple fibre,\npolyester film, ABS resins, and\nelectronic products but mainly finished\nfabric, yarn, and grey fabric.\nCOMPANY 8\nCompany 8 is a large French-based\nmultinational classified under the\ntelecommunications industry. The study\nwas focused on its subsidiary in\nMalaysia. The main business activities\nof the subsidiary involve distribution of\ntelecommunications equipment and\nmanufacturing of power supply\nproducts.\nCOMPANY 9\nCompany 9 is a large US-based\nmultinational operating in the food and\nbeverages industry. The group carries\nsome of the most known brands in the\nworldwide market. The study was\nfocused on its subsidiary in Malaysia.\nThe main business activities of the\nsubsidiary are sales and marketing of\nglobal beverage products.\n33\nAPPENDIX B: Summary of IS Planning\nCOMPANY 1\nIS planning in the UK subsidiary 1 is\ndecentralised, while in other subsidiaries\nit is centralised. The corporate\ninterviewees explained that this is due to\nthe subsidiary being the most profitable\nwithin the group. The subsidiary noted\nthat IS planning enables them to focus on\nbeing innovative in IS\/IT. No major\nissues were raised by the subsidiary\ninterviewees. The IS planning in the\nsubsidiary follows the Organisational\napproach and IS\/IT is planned through\ninformal meetings and discussions with\nthe business managers. Both the\nsubsidiary IT and business interviewees\nbelieve the approach they follow has\nbeen successful.\nCOMPANY 2\nIS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary\nis fairly centralised with directions for\nIS\/IT applications coming from the\nregional office in Singapore, business\ngroup headquarters in the UK, and\ncorporate headquarters in the USA. To\ncontrol cost and streamline processes,\nthe main focus of IS planning is to\nmaximise scale economies through\nstandardisation and use of regional\nsystems and global infrastructure. Being\na small subsidiary, the subsidiary\nbelieves that their specific business\nneeds get little priority in the\ncentral\/regional IS\/IT plan. The\nsubsidiary felt that the Administrative\napproach they follow has been\nsatisfactory.\nCOMPANY 3\nIS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary\nhas been fairly centralised. In order to\ncontrol costs, maximising scale\neconomies is clearly the main focus of IS\nplanning. Even though the Company is\ntrying to shift from the Technology \u2013led\napproach to the Business-led approach,\nthe current IS planning is clearly\nfollowing the Administrative approach.\nThe subsidiary interviewees are\nconcerned about their specific business\nneeds not adequately addressed by the\nglobal systems they were asked to adopt.\nOverall, the subsidiary felt that the\ncurrent IS planning approach is\nsatisfactory.\nCOMPANY 4\nIS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary\nis highly centralised. With the group\u2019s\npoor business performance and problems\nintegrating different systems worldwide,\ncontrolling costs and streamlining\nbusiness processes receive the highest\nattention by the new corporate CIO. The\nfocus of IS planning is clearly to\nmaximise scale economies and the IS\nplanning approach is Administrative.\nWith only one person in charge of IS\/IT\nin the subsidiary, many issues were\nraised by the subsidiary interviewees.\nThe subsidiary felt that the current IS\nplanning approach is less than\nsatisfactory.\nCOMPANY 5\nIS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary\nis fairly centralised, with directions\ncoming from four headquarters (for four\ndifferent business units), all based in\nJapan. Focus of IS planning is to\nmaximise scale economies through\nglobal systems and infrastructure. The\nsubsidiary IT interviewee cited problems\nwith high costs and difficulties in getting\nlocal experts for global systems, and that\nthe systems do not meet local\nrequirements. The subsidiary business\ninterviewees cited the problems with the\nmain network hub in Japan. Overall, the\nsubsidiary interviewees rated the\nAdministrative approach they follow as\nsatisfactory.\nCOMPANY 6\nIS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary\nis fairly decentralised. Even with\ndirectives coming from the headquarters\nand region, particularly on infrastructure,\nthe subsidiary is very much involved in\nIS\/IT planning. Many IS developments\nwere done and initiated by the\nsubsidiary. The systems they developed\nwon an award from the Malaysian\ngovernment. These systems are not only\nused by the subsidiary but also by others\nin the region. Issues raised by the\nsubsidiary include high IT cost of\nstandard hardware and some\nimplementation problems. The\nsubsidiary felt that the Business\u2013led\napproach they follow is more than\nsatisfactory.\nCOMPANY 7\nIS planning in the Malaysian subsidiary\nis well decentralised. The subsidiary\ndecides almost everything related to the\nbusiness and IS\/IT matters, apart from\nprojects exceeding RM1 million ($US\n300,000). Being on its own, the focus of\nIS planning is initiative and innovation.\nNo issues were raised by the subsidiary\nIT Manager but the subsidiary business\ninterviewees cited their concerns about\nlong lead-times of IT projects and some\nmiscellaneous technical issues.
