Introduction\nThe problem of escape from a locally stable attractor is ubiquitous in the natural\nsciences, and arises most notably in chemical kinetics and in transport within nonlinear\nsystems such as semiconductors. From the mathematical point of view, the presence of\nan attractor implies the existence of a corresponding basin of attraction, de:ned as the\nset of initial conditions in phase space from which the system approaches the attractor\nas time tends to in:nity. The basin boundary is the set of points representing the limits\nof at least two di;erent basins. In general, both an attractor and its basin boundary\nmay have a complex geometrical structure. One of the most challenging cases to be\nconsidered, therefore, is the problem of escape from a chaotic attractor with fractal\nbasin boundary.\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: a.silchenko@lancaster.ac.uk (A.N. Silchenko).\nA promising approach to this problem is based on its analysis for very small noise\nintensities. In this limit, a stochastic dynamical system Buctuates to remote states along\ncertain most probable deterministic paths [1,2], corresponding to rays in the WKB-like\nasymptotic solution of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation [3]. The possibility of extending\nsuch an approach to chaotic systems was established earlier [4\u20137]. However, there are\nstill no theoretical predictions about the mechanism of escape. In particular, the prob-\nlems of the uniqueness of the escape path, and of the form of the boundary conditions,\nremain unsolved. An understanding of the escape mechanism can be expected to shed\nlight on the complex dependence of the escape rate on the system parameters. Thus,\nin recent studies of escape in the presence of homoclinic tangencies, it was shown\nthat they lead to a qualitative change in the escape mechanism that has the e;ect of\ndecreasing the activation energy [8]. One can ask, what is the role of the saddle cycles\narising at the tangencies of the stable and unstable manifolds and forming a homoclinic\nstructure?\nIt was shown recently [9] that deep physical insight into this problem can be achieved\nthrough an analysis of actual Buctuational escape trajectories (see e.g. Ref. [10]). More-\nover, such an analysis can be used to solve the problem of the energy-optimal control\nof switching from a chaotic attractor [11] in the absence of noise.\nIn this paper we apply a statistical analysis of the Buctuational paths to reveal a\ngeneric mechanism by which escape occurs from a chaotic attractor with a locally\ndisconnected fractal basin boundary. As a model, we treat the two-dimensional map\noriginally introduced by Holmes [12]:\nxi+1 = yi ;\nyi+1 =\u2212bxi + ayi \u2212 y3i + \u0007i ; (1)\nwhere \u0007i is white Gaussian noise with \u3008\u0007i\u3009 = 0 and \u3008\u0007i; \u0007j\u3009 = 2D\nij. The choice of\n(1) is justi:ed by the fact that it demonstrates a generic type of locally disconnected\nfractal basin boundary (see Ref. [13]) and reproduces the more important features\nof the chaotic dynamics of the periodically driven DuKng oscillator [12]. The use\nof a discrete model brings the additional advantage of allowing us to speed up our\nnumerical calculation for the case of low noise intensity. In Section 2 we present the\nresults of numerical simulations allowing us to :nd a boundary point on the fractal\nbasin boundary. Section 3 is devoted to a study of the homoclinic structure in (1) and\nits role in the formation of escape paths. Our conclusions are given in Section 4.\n2. An accessible point as a boundary condition\nWe choose values of the control parameters b and a in (1) such that, in the purely\ndeterministic case (when D = 0), there are two co-existing chaotic attractors in phase\nspace separated by a locally disconnected fractal basin boundary (see Fig. 1(a)). We\nexcite our system (1) with weak noise and collect the trajectories that include escape\npaths from one chaotic attractor to the other (see Fig. 1(b)). The noise intensity was\nchosen in such a way that the mean escape time was essentially large; the characteristic\nrelaxation time of an invariant measure on the corresponding chaotic set was estimated\nO(a)\nxn\nyn\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nn\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nxn period-3 cycle\n(b)\nFig. 1. (a) Two co-existing chaotic attractors (black lines) in (1) at a = 2:7; b = 0:2 and their basins of\nattraction illustrated in gray and white respectively. The points of the period-3 homoclinic saddles cycle\nare labeled by black dots, and the point O corresponds to the saddle at (0; 0); (b) Some typical escape\ntrajectories collected with D = 10\u22125.\nby us as 3 \u00d7 107 iterations. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 1(b), all escape trajecto-\nries have a part corresponding to the period-3 saddle cycle, apparently implying the\npresence of a boundary point located near, or directly on, the fractal boundary. Simple\ncalculations have shown that period-3 saddle cycle does exist for the chosen parameter\nvalues and that it lies on the boundary. Moreover, its stable manifold (full black line)\nlying in the boundary detaches the open neighborhood including the chaotic attractor\nfrom the fractal basin boundary itself. One part of its unstable manifold belongs to\nthe homoclinic structure forming the fractal boundary, whereas the other part (labeled\nby the dashed black line in Fig. 1(a)) approaches the attractor. Thus, we can clas-\nsify this period-3 saddle point as an accessible boundary point. Indeed, by de:nition\ngiven in Ref. [14] a boundary point P is accessible from a given region if there is a\ncurve of :nite length connecting P to an attractor in the interior of the region, such\nthat no point of the curve lies in the boundary except for P. In our case, the part\nof unstable manifold approaching the chaotic attractor plays the role of such a curve.\nThus, in the present case, the period-3 saddle point plays the role of the boundary\ncondition.\n3. Homoclinic saddle cycles and their hierarchy\nIt is well known that the global behavior of a chaotic dynamical system is in many\nrespects determined by a homoclinic structure, i.e., by a set consisting of homoclinic\nsaddle cycles resulting at tangencies of the stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle\npoint. In our case, we observe an in:nite sequence of saddle-node bifurcations of\nperiod 3; 4; 5; 6; 7 : : : , which occur at parameter values d3\u00a1d4\u00a1d5\u00a1d6\u00a1d7 : : : and\nare caused by the sequent tangencies of the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle\npoint O at (0; 0). The homoclinic orbits appearing as the result of these bifurcations\nwere classi:ed earlier as original saddles [14]. It was also shown that their stable\nand unstable manifolds cross each other in the hierarchical sequence: the unstable\nmanifold of the period-3 saddle crosses the stable manifold of the period-4 saddle, the\nunstable manifold of the period-4 saddle crosses the stable manifold of the period-5\nsaddle, etc. (see Fig. 3(a)). Our numerical calculations have shown that these original\nsaddles play a key role in the escape through a fractal basin boundary and that their\nhierarchy de:nes the structure of the escape paths. A typical escape path obtained\nin numerical simulations is depicted in Fig. 2. As clearly seen from this :gure, a\nphase trajectory leaving the chaotic attractor penetrates into the fractal basin boundary\nthrough a small neighborhood of the period-3 saddle cycle, makes a few turns, and\nthen approaches another period-4 original saddle point. After that it moves to the basin\nof the other chaotic attractor, reaching it in the next two or three iterations. In fact, the\nheteroclinic structure formed by numerous sequent crossings of the stable and unstable\nmanifolds of original homoclinic saddles plays the role of the \u201cstaircase\u201d allowing\na trajectory to pass over the fractal basin boundary and de:ning the structure of the\nescape paths. Moreover, a hierarchical relation between original saddles can be revealed\nif we characterize them by a parameter \u0010 equal to the ratio |\u0011s(P)|=\u0011u(P) of the stable\nand unstable eigenvalues of the linearized deterministic Bow at a saddle point P [15].\nSimple calculations show that, for the original saddles with periods 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8 : : : in\n(1), the following hierarchical sequence of index \u0010 values occurs: \u00103 = 3:339; \u00104 =\n3:08; \u00105 = 2:999; \u00106 = 2:339; \u00107 = 1:958; \u00108 = 1:539. To estimate the inBuence of such\na hierarchical relation on the escape paths, the probabilities of :nding the original\nsaddle of period N in the escape trajectory were computed for di;erent values of noise\n43\n4\n43\n4\n3\nO\nx\nn\nn\ny\nFig. 2. The escape trajectory in (1) from one chaotic attractor (black lines) to the other passes through the\nperiod-3 (full black lines) and period-4 (dashed black lines) original saddle cycles. The values of the control\nparameters and noise intensity are the same as in Fig. 1.\nintensity. Initial conditions for the iteration procedure were chosen randomly within\na small neighborhood of the period-3 saddle cycle lying on the basin boundary. As\nseen from the results presented in Fig. 3(b), the probabilities of :nding a fragment of\nthe corresponding original saddle cycles in the escape trajectories are in a very good\nagreement with the hierarchical relation obtained above. In fact, the addition of noise\nreveals the hierarchy described, correcting slightly the absolute values of probability,\nbut it does not change the structure of distribution qualitatively.\n4. Conclusions\nWe have studied noise-induced escape from one chaotic attractor to another through\na fractal basin boundary. It was shown that escape occurs through a unique point on\nthe fractal boundary. The original saddles forming the homoclinic structure of system\n(1) play the key role in the formation of the escape paths, and the di;erence in\ntheir local stability de:nes the hierarchical relationship between them. Thus, we may\nclaim that complicated structure of escape trajectories, caused by the thin homo-\nclinic structure and their randomness, has in many respects a deterministic\nnature.\n34\n5\n6\n0         1 2         3 4 5 6 7 8         9 10\nT\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nP\nD = 0\nD = 1e-08\nn\n(b)\n(a)\nFig. 3.
