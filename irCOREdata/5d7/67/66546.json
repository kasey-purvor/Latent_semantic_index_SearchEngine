Introduction\n[2] The evolution of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS)\nhas been identified by many authors as a key uncertainty in\nour ability to predict future sea-level change [Church et al.,\n2001]. The vast majority (>90%) of mass lost from the ice\nsheet flows through a relatively small (\u000110) number of ice\nstreams. An understanding of the long-term behaviour of\nthese ice streams is therefore vital if we are to predict future\nsea level accurately.\n[3] PIG has the largest discharge (66 Gt yr\u00021) of all\nWAIS ice streams. Together with its Amundsen-Coast\nneighbour Thwaites Glacier, it drains \u000140% (by volume)\nof the ice sheet (see Figure 1, top). The marine termini of\nthese glaciers have been highlighted as potential sources of\nrapid retreat because of their lack of significant ice shelves\nand a bedrock topography which deepens considerably\ninland [Weertman, 1974]. Based on the mapping of hinge-\nline positions using satellite radar interferometry [Rignot,\n1998], the grounding line of PIG is known to have retreated\nbetween 1992 and 1996 at a rate of 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 km yr\u00021 with\nan implied ice thinning rate of 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 m yr\u00021. Satellite\nradar altimetry over the period 1992 to 1999 confirms this\nrate at the grounding line but shows that the thinning\nextends remarkably far (over 200 km) inland [Shepherd et\nal., 2001]. The thinning appears to be restricted to the\ndomain of the ice stream where it averages 0.75 \u00b1 0.07 m\nyr\u00021. This rate is well above the levels expected from\nrandom variations in snowfall [Wingham et al., 1998], and\nis reflected in Thwaites Glacier and the adjoining Smith\nGlacier (averaging 0.55 \u00b1 0.09 and 3.21 \u00b1 0.24 m yr\u00021,\nrespectively) [Shepherd et al., 2002]. This latter observation\nis important and points towards an external factor forcing\nthe behaviour of all three ice streams, as opposed to internal\nsurge-type variability. Repeat interferometry and sequential\nvisible imagery available for 7 periods from 1974 to 2000\nreveals two phases of acceleration in the flow of PIG (1974\nto 1987, and 1994 to 2000) separated by at least seven years\nof steady flow [Rignot et al., 2002; Joughin et al., 2003].\nThe magnitude of this acceleration (22% overall) is suffi-\ncient to explain the observed thinning on the basis of flux\nbalance calculations [Joughin et al., 2003], which implies a\nchange in the flow dynamics of the ice stream.\n[4] Although there is now a large body of observational\nevidence documenting changes in PIG on sub-decadal\ntimescales, the modelling that is needed to identify their\ncause has received relatively little attention (with the\nnotable exception of the study by Schmeltz et al. [2002]).\nThe aim of this paper is therefore to use a numerical model\nof ice flow to determine whether an oceanic trigger can\naffect the deep interior of the ice stream on the appropriate\ntimescales.\n2. Modelling\n[5] Changes in the flow of an ice stream, such as PIG,\noccur in response to changes in its force balance. We can\ntherefore use the force balance to assess various hypotheses\naccounting for the observed acceleration and thinning dis-\ncussed above. The force balance is between gravitational\ndriving stress (proportional to the product of ice thickness\nand surface slope) and the sum of resistances from lateral\ndrag (of slower flowing ice abutting the stream\u2019s margins),\nbasal drag and longitudinal stress gradients within the\nstream [van der Veen and Whillans, 1989]. The ice streams\nof the glaciologically-distinct Siple-Coast sector (Figure 1,\ntop) have a complex history of migration and stagnation\non timescales of decades to centuries, which has been\nattributed to changes in the thermodynamics and hydrology\nof their beds. Similar processes may be affecting the basal\ndrag experienced by PIG however the simultaneous\nthinning of all three Amundsen-Coast ice streams (PIG,\nThwaites and Smith Glaciers) is difficult to reconcile with\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 31, L23401, doi:10.1029\/2004GL021284, 2004\n1Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM), University of\nBristol, Bristol, UK.\n2Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM), University of\nCambridge, Cambridge, UK.\n3Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM), University\nCollege London, London, UK.\n4Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,\nPasadena, California, USA.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/04\/2004GL021284$05.00\nL23401 1 of 4\nthis mechanism [Shepherd et al., 2002]. Changes in the\nwidth of an ice stream affect the lateral drag that it\nexperiences [Whillans and van der Veen, 1997] and could\nalso therefore explain PIG\u2019s acceleration. Satellite imagery\nof the area, however, shows little change in the lateral extent\nof the ice stream.\n[6] Changes in either the driving stress or longitudinal\nstress gradients within the stream are therefore left as\npossible explanations. These changes could arise through\nthe long-term retreat of the ice sheet from its maximum\nextent near the continental shelf break some 16,000 radio-\ncarbon years before present [Lowe and Anderson, 2002].\nThis seems unlikely given that the observed rates of\nthinning would lead to complete decay within 600 years\n[Shepherd et al., 2001]. In addition, there is clearly a\ndecadal element in the flow variability of PIG [Joughin et\nal., 2003]. A hypothesis that explains many of the obser-\nvations is that PIG is responding to changes in drag in either\nits ice plain (a 10-km wide zone of low surface slopes\nassociated with the grounding line) or ice shelf. These\nchanges could be associated with iceberg calving [Rignot,\n1998] or ice shelf\/plain thinning in response to enhanced\noceanic melting [Rignot, 2002], which then generate an\ninitial perturbation near the grounding line that is then\ntransmitted \u0001200 km upstream throughout the interior\nof PIG. This mechanism could potentially explain the\nsynchronicity of the changes along the Amundsen Coast,\nand has important implications for the influence of a\nchanging ocean on the future stability of the WAIS. A\nmajor hurdle to the acceptance of this hypothesis is,\nhowever, that the time available for PIG to respond is very\nmuch shorter (tightly constrained by observations to be less\nthan 20 years [Rignot et al., 2002; Joughin et al., 2003])\nthan the timescales previously thought possible. In the\nremainder of this letter, we employ an ice-flow model to\ndetermine whether this mechanism can realistically generate\nthe observed thinning rates \u0001200 km upstream of the\ngrounding line on a decadal timescale.\n[7] To test this hypothesis, we employ a newly-developed\nhigher-order model of PIG\u2019s flow. The model consists\nof two main elements. The first is a three-dimensional\nrepresentation of the stress balance within an ice mass,\nwhich incorporates all stress components (both vertical and\nhorizontal) to first order (i.e., shear stresses are omitted from\nthe vertical stress balance, however all terms are retained in\nthe horizontal balances). It therefore avoids the key criticism\nof previous PIG modelling in that no questionable a priori\nassumptions about PIG\u2019s flow regime need to be made [e.g.,\nSchmeltz et al., 2002]. The model solves the stress balance\nin elliptical form using Glen\u2019s flow law to substitute stresses\nwith the appropriate strain rates [e.g., Pattyn, 2003]. The\nrate factor for ice deformation is held constant at a value\ndetermined by local ice temperature (assumed to vary\nlinearly from observed air temperature at the ice surface\nto pressure melting point at the bed).\n[8] The model employs realistic geometry along a\ntransect from the ice-shelf front to the ice divide (Figure 2,\ntop). Boundary conditions are zero velocity at the ice divide\nand lateral boundaries; zero stress at the upper subaerial and\nlower ice-shelf boundaries; and a force balance with the\ndisplaced ocean water at the shelf front. A viscous basal\nslip law with variable basal-drag coefficient is employed\n[MacAyeal, 1989] within the extent of PIG. Elsewhere the\nbasal boundary condition is zero velocity. Observed ice-\nsurface velocities are used to calibrate the model primarily\nby tuning the basal-drag coefficient in the seven regions\nshown in Figure 1 (top). The resultant fit is very satisfactory\n(Figure 1, bottom). The second element of the model is the\ntemporal evolution of ice thickness, which is allowed to\nvary as a consequence of the velocity fields generated by the\nstress model. This, again, is a new feature of the model\ncompared to previous PIG studies.\n[9] We employ this model in two separate applications.\nFirst, we use the three-dimensional stress-balance model\nto study the stress regime of PIG and its instantaneous\nresponse to change. Second, we employ a vertically-\nintegrated version of the stress model with temporal\nevolution of ice thickness to study the delayed response.\n3. Results: Instantaneous Response\n[10] Results from stress-balance model (Figure 2, middle)\nindicate that PIG has three distinct flow zones: the ice\nshelf and plain where all stress components are important; a\n40-km zone upstream of this in which driving stress is\nbalanced almost completely by basal drag (we refer to this\nFigure 1. (top) The PIG model transect showing locations\nof cross-sections (C1 to C6) and regions in which the basal\ndrag coefficient was calibrated (I is the ice shelf, II the ice\nplain, III the steepening, and IV to VI the trunk; basal\nvelocity was set to zero outside of these regions). The\nbackground image shows ice-surface velocity magnitudes\nderived from interferometry.

The stress regime in the trunk is similar\nto that operating in the Siple Coast ice streams implying a\nsubstrate of similarly weak, subglacial sediments. The\nsteepening, however, is characterized by very much higher\nbasal drag implying that the substrate in this area is stronger\n(either hard bedrock or over-consolidated sediment).\n[11] We now perturb the calibrated flow model in two\ngrounding-line retreat scenarios, and in a third scenario in\nwhich the basal drag coefficient in the ice plain is reduced\n(simulating the effect of the reduced bed contact consequent\non thinning and floatation). The snapshot results imply that\nthe immediate mechanical effect of these perturbations is\nfelt up to 100 km from the grounding line (Figure 2,\nbottom). This direct effect is brought about by acceleration\nas a reduction in basal\/lateral drag is transmitted via\nlongitudinal stress gradients upglacier. The changes in\nvelocity produced in these experiments are consistent\n(\u000130%) with observations. The predicted accelerations\ncannot, however, explain the observed thinning over the\nentire extent of the ice stream (up to \u0001200 km upstream\nof the grounding line) and, therefore, imply that an ocean-\nbased trigger is unlikely.\n4. Results: Delayed Response\n[12] Faced with this apparent anomaly, we now investi-\ngate the effects of the perturbed velocity field on PIG\u2019s\nthickness. We do this in a time-dependent fashion by\nallowing the calculated stress and velocity distributions to\naffect the temporal evolution of ice thickness within the\nmodel, as well as allowing changing ice-surface geometry to\naffect gravitational driving in the stress model. Results from\nthe three-dimensional model suggest that PIG experiences\nplug flow (no vertical shear) over the majority of its length\n(vertical shear accounts for a maximum of \u000117% of total\nflow at the steepening, Figure 2, top). This observation\njustifies the use (primarily for reasons of numerical effi-\nciency and stability) of a vertically-integrated stress model\n(which assumes minimal vertical shear [e.g., MacAyeal,\n1989]) in the time-dependent calculations described here.\nFurther, the vertically-integrated version of the model gen-\nerates results that are consistent with the three-dimensional\nresults for the snapshot perturbation experiments discussed\nabove.\n[13] In the context of the long response times traditionally\naccorded to ice sheets, the results are surprising because\nthey indicate that the initial anomaly can propagate far\ninland on very short, decadal timescales (Figure 3). Further\nnumerical experiments indicate that the speed of this up-\nstream propagation is a robust feature of our model and, we\nsuggest, of the real PIG system.\n[14] The transmission of a perturbation in ice thickness\nthrough an ice mass can be represented as the sum of\nsource, kinematic-wave and diffusive responses [Nye,\n1963]. Based on the observations for PIG, we estimate that\nthe equivalent response times for the kinematic-wave and\ndiffusion terms are \u0001130 and \u000120 yr, respectively (using a\nlength scale of 200 km, a downstream kinematic wave\nspeed of 1.5 km yr\u00021 and a diffusivity of 2000 km2 yr\u00021;\nFigure 2.

Plots refer to the response at PIG\u2019s centreline\nand dashed vertical line refers to the grounding line. Above\n260 km, the response is muted because this point marks the\nboundary between the fast-flowing PIG and slow-flowing\ninland ice.\nL23401 PAYNE ET AL.: THINNING OF LARGEST WEST ANTARCTIC ICE STREAM L23401\n3 of 4\nthe latter calculated using an analytical expression for ice-\nstream flow [Raymond, 1996]). The timing of the modelled\n(and observed) upstream thinning is therefore consistent\nwith a diffusive process. Our estimate of the diffusive\nresponse time is probably an underestimate because it\nincorporates kinematic effects but not the effects of longi-\ntudinal stress coupling. Acceleration in the ice plain pro-\nduces a local increase in ice surface slope via down draw,\nwhich increases driving stress and leads to an acceleration\nof ice flow upstream of the original location. This mecha-\nnism has previously been hypothesized [Bindschadler,\n1997; Joughin et al., 2003], however this is its first\ndemonstration in a numerical model.\n[15] In our numerical experiments, the initial acceleration\nis generated by a reduction in the basal drag coefficient of\nthe ice plain, however we obtain very similar results in a\nrange of experiments in which various aspects of the\nrheology and geometry of the ice shelf are perturbed. We\nhypothesize that in the real ice stream this loss of drag is a\nconsequence of reduced ice grounding in the area, itself\ncaused by the thinning occasioned by enhanced oceanic\nmelt.\n5. Discussion\n[16] The numerical experiments reported here do not lead\nto catastrophic retreat. A new equilibrium is attained after\napproximately 150 years with a total thinning of \u00018 m over\nthe majority of PIG and 16 m in the ice plain. However, it is\nimportant to note that this is the response to a single,\ninstantaneous change in the ice plain. In reality, ice-plain\nthinning (and loss of basal drag) may well continue into the\nfuture (especially if they are indeed brought about by\nincreased oceanic melt), in which case the eventual response\nof PIG would be far greater.\n[17] It should also be stressed that the simulation does not\ninclude a potential positive feedback in the ice plain, where\nthinning is associated with reduced grounding and a further\nreduction in basal drag (in the experiments the perturbed\nbasal drag coefficient is held constant after the initial\nperturbation). Our knowledge of the subglacial topography\nin this area is not yet sufficient to allow a parameterization\nof this effect. The modelled thinning of PIG is accompanied\nby thickening of its ice shelf (Figure 3). This thickening\nhas not been seen in satellite observations although its\nmagnitude is greater than the estimated error of such\nobservations [Shepherd et al., 2003]. This disparity may\nimply that recent increases in mass loss from the ice shelf by\noceanic melt are large enough to mask this thickening.\n[18] In conclusion, our results show that changes in PIG\u2019s\nice shelf and\/or ice plain can be transmitted rapidly\nupstream on decadal timescales. It therefore appears likely\nthat the observed widespread thinning in the interior regions\nof PIG is a response to recent changes in the oceanography\nof the Amundsen Sea, which we postulate caused increased\nbasal melt and thinning of PIG\u2019s ice plain. The results\nsuggest that the presence of ice streams strengthens the\ncoupling between coastal areas and the deep interior of\nWAIS.\n[19] Acknowledgments.
