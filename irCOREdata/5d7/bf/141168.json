This research is first\nknown attempt investigating the comparative effectiveness of applying the Kurtogram\nto both vibration and AE data from a defective bearing.\nKeywords: Acoustic Emission, Condition monitoring, Spectral Kurtosis, Vibration,\nKurtogram\n1. Introduction\nThe rolling element bearing is the most common part of any rotating machine and\nmonitoring its integrity is of vital importance. Vibration monitoring is the most\nwidely used method for bearing diagnosis where signals are normally processed in\ntime or frequency domains. In the time domain, typical statistical features of the\nmeasured vibration signal such as r.m.s, peak value and Kurtosis, etc, are trended over\nthe duration of the test and changes in patterns are attributed to presence of defects.\nAmong these statistical features, the value of Kurtosis was found to be most effective\nin detecting the onset of bearing failure [1] .For an undamaged bearing the Kurtosis is\ntypically 3 while greater values are normally associated with loss of integrity.\nHowever, the main drawback of using this method is that the Kurtosis begins to revert\nback to the undamaged value as the defect further develops [1, 2]. Other statistical\nfeatures such as the Kolmogorov \u2013 Smirnov statistic has been applied by several\ninvestigators [3, 4] in which they reported success in diagnosing a damaged bearing.\nFrequency domain analysis for machine fault diagnosis is well established and the\nauthors refer the readers to a review by Patil et al[2].\nThe application of Acoustic Emission (AE) in monitoring the rolling element bearings\nhas grown in popularity over the past few decades [5]. To date most of the published\nworks have studied the applicability of AE technology in detecting seeded faults\nartificially introduced on the bearing. Yoshioka[6] was among the first who studied\nthe applicability of AE in detecting naturally degraded roller bearing. However, the\nnumber of rollers employed in Yoshioka\u2019s research was limited to three which is not\nrepresentative of operational bearings. Additionally, Yoshioaka terminated the test\nonce the AE level reached to a certain predefined threshold therefore propagation of\nthe surface defect was not monitored. Later, Elforjani et al [7, 8] conducted an\nexperiment which built on Yoshioka\u2019s work. Their results showed the effectiveness of\nAE in detecting the onset of bearing failure, identifying the circumferential location of\nthe defect on the race at very early stages of degradation, and the diagnostic potential\nof the measured AE signal by enveloping and using the KS statistic. Although\nconclusive, this research was not representative of broad operation condition as the\ntest was at a slow rotational speed (72 r.p.m). The results presented in this paper aim\nto compliment the work of Elforjani [7, 8] by experimentally investigating the use of\nAE for detecting natural degradation of a bearing at a rotational speed of 1500 r.p.m.\nIn addition, the use of the Kurtogram for improving signal-to-noise ratios on AE\nwaveforms from a bearing is explored.\nThe Spectral Kurtosis (SK) as an effective signal processing method is gaining ground\nin vibration analysis. To determine the SK the signal is firstly decomposed into the\ntime-frequency domain after which the Kurtosis values are determined for each\nfrequency band [9]. The concept of SK analysis was first developed by Dwyer [10] as\na tool which was able to trace non-Gaussian features in different frequency bands\nusing the fourth order moment of the real part of the Short Time Fourier Transform\n(STFT). Dwyer only investigated the application of SK on stationary processes but\ndid not account for non-stationary vibration signatures typical of rotating machines.\nTo date the most comprehensive calculations of the SK has been developed by Antoni\n[11] as the fourth order cumulant of the spectral moment (K) :\n2\n)(\n)(\n)( 2\n2\n4\n\uf02d\uf03d\nf\nf\nf\nS\nSK\nY\nY\nY  f\u22600 (1)\nand\n\uf0f1\uf0e1\uf03d\n\uf044 n\nWnY\nftf YS ),()( (2)\n),( ftY W is estimated using the short time Fourier Transform:\neY nfjW tnWnYft \uf0702)()(),( \uf02d\n\uf0a5\n\uf0a5\uf02d\n\uf044\n\uf02d\uf0d7\uf03d\uf0e5 (3)\nWhere Y(n) is sampled version of the signal, Y(t), and W(n) is the window function\nhaving zero value outside a chosen interval. For the above calculations to be valid the\nsize of window (Nw) should smaller than the length between two repetitive impulses\nand longer than length of each impulses. In other word, the analyzed signal should be\nlocally stationary. Using the definition offered by Antoni [11], Antoni and Randall\n[12] developed the concept of the Kurtogram to detect non-guassinatiy in a signal. A\nKurtogram simply maps the STFT-based SK values as function of frequency and\nwindow size. Antoni [11, 12] suggested the use of the Kurtogram for designing a\nband-pass filter which can be applied to increase the signal\u2013to-noise ratio thereby\npreserving the impulse-like nature of signal. For this particular investigation the\nfrequency and window size (bandwidth) at which the Kurtogram is maximum was\nemployed to build a band-pass filter which was applied to measured AE and vibration\ndata. This research is first known attempt investigating the comparative effectiveness\nof applying the Kurtogram to both vibration and AE data from a defective bearing.\n2. Experimental Setup\nThe test rig used in this experiment was of the same arrangement as employed by\nElforjani et al [8], see figure 1. It consisted of a hydraulic loading device, a geared\nelectrical motor (MOTOVARIO-TypeHA52 B3-B6-B7 j20, 46-Lubricated: AGIP), a\ncoupling and a supporting structure. The bearing test rig has been designed to\nsimulate varying operating conditions for a bearing and fail this bearing in fatigue.\nThe chosen bearing for this study is an SKF single thrust ball bearing, model number\nSKF51210. This bearing was chosen as it was easily available and cost effective to\nuse. To ensure fatigue cracking initiation in the ball race being monitored the standard\ngrooved race was replaced with a flat race, model number SKF 81210TN. This\nincreased the point contact force between the ball bearings and the race resulting in\nfaster degradation of the bearing race and early initiation of sub surface fatigue\ncracks. For the purpose of this experiment the following procedure was undertaken to\ndetermine the subsurface stresses on the test bearing and thereby estimate the time, or\nnumber of cycles, prior to a surface defect on the race track. Theories employed for\nthis procedure, particularly for the flat race, included the Hertzian theory for\ndetermining surface stresses and deformations, the Thomas and Hoersh theory for\nsubsurface stress, and the Lundberg and Palmgren theory for fatigue evaluation. For\nthe grooved race the standard procedure, as described by BS 5512,1991, was\nemployed for determining dynamic load rating .Theoretically determined life was\ncalculated to be 16 t hours.The test bearing was placed between the fixed thrust\nloading shaft and the rotating disk which housed the grooved race. The flat race was\nfitted onto the loading shaft in a specifically designed housing. This housing was\nconstructed to allow for placement of AE sensors directly onto the race. The thrust\nshaft was driven by a hydraulic cylinder (Hi-Force Hydraulics-Model No: HP110-\nHand Pump-Single Speed-Working Pressure: 700 bar), which moved forward to load\nthe bearing and backwards for periodic inspections of the test bearing face. The\nrotating disk was driven by a shaft attached to a motor with an output speed of 1500\nrpm. The number of rolling elements used in this research was 14 and the ball pass\nfrequency (BPF) was calculated as 175Hz using equation 4 [1] .\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf03d \uf061cos1\n120\n1\nD\ndnNBPF (4)\nWhere,\nd=Ball diameter\nD=Pitch diameter\n\u03b1=Contact angle\nn=Shaft rotation velocity (RPM) N=Number of balls\nFigure 1 The test rig assembly\nThe AE acquisition system employed commercially available piezoelectric sensors\n(Physical Acoustic Corporation) with an operating range of 100\u2013750 kHz. All four\nAE sensors were mounted at the back of the flat race test bearing and connected to a\ndata acquisition system through a preamplifier (40 dB gain) AE waveforms were\ntaken every three minutes throughout the test duration at the sampling rate of 2 MHz.\nAn accelerometer was mounted on the flat race housing (see figure 1) and vibration\nmeasurements were acquired at a sampling rate of 10 kHz at three-minute intervals\nusing a NI-6009 USB analog to digital data acquisition card.\n3. Test procedure\nThe test rig was allowed to operate until vibration levels far exceeded typical\noperating levels at which point the test was terminated. An axial load of\napproximately 50000N was applied on the bearing throughout the test and a total of\nthree tests were performed.\nAccelerometer\nTest Bearing\nCoupling\nLoading part\nTwo tests are presented in this paper with quite distinct signal-to-noise ratios; Test 2\nwas significantly nosier for both vibration and AE measurements. This was attributed\nto the variation in test rig assembly, such as adjustments and sensor attachments\ntherefore it offered a good opportunity to asses methods for diagnosis.Such challenges\nwith AE sensor attachment and noise interference have been discussed recently [13].\nThe overall trends of Acoustic Emission and vibration levels for both tests are\npresented in figure 2. Also presented in figure 3 is the defect observed on termination\nof Test-1 clearly displaying a spall on the flat race.\nFigure 2 Overall AE and vibration r.m.s levels\nFigure 3 Defect on the outer race (naturally developed over 4hrs of\noperation)\n4. Vibration Monitoring\nThe vibration waveforms for both tests at defined time intervals are detailed in table 1\nand figure 4.Under ideal conditions it would be expected that for the particular type of\ndefect generated during the test (see figure 3) large transient vibration impulses\nspaced at defect frequency would be evident. This defect frequency is characteristic of\nthe bearing elements. However, due to the high level of operational noise, resulting in\na low signal to noise ratio, the presence of these spikes was not always visually\nevident in the captured waveforms. The frequency spectrums of the waveforms are\nalso presented in figure 5. The Ball Pass Frequency (BPF) was evident at stages \u2018E\u2019\nand \u2018F\u2019 of Test-1 whilst this defect frequency was barely present at stages \u2018E\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019\non Test- 2. In addition several harmonics of the running speed (25 Hz) was noted with\nthe third harmonic (75 Hz) dominant for both tests. In an attempt to achieve a better\nresolution in detecting the fault frequency envelope analysis was undertaken. The\nsignals were band pass filtered about a centre frequency of 1570 Hz using the least-\nsquare FIR filter of order 50 with a bandwidth of 40Hz . Selection of this centre\nfrequency was based on observation of the spectrum of the last recorded vibration\nstage where a large peak was evident at 1570 Hz for both tests, see figure 6. It is\nbelieved that this frequency (1570 Hz) is associated with one of the resonance\nfrequencies of the bearing test-rig and this frequency was excited due to the impulsive\nimpacts of the rollers over the defective race. The filtered signals were enveloped\nusing the Hilbert transform. Figure 7 presents the envelope spectrum of the filtered\nsignals with the defect frequency now clearly evident at interval \u2018F\u2019 particularly for\ntest 2. This was to be expected given the selected frequency for filtering was chosen\nfrom the spectrum at interval \u2018F\u2019. This also shows that the selection of the filtering\nfrequency is dependent on the dynamic characteristic of the bearing\/machine at the\ntime of vibration measurement as seen in figure 6 where the filtering frequency of\n1570 Hz was not dominate at the earlier test intervals.\nTable 1 Timing interval\nTest 1 Test 2\nA 40 min 40 min\nB 80 min 80 min\nC 120 min 120 min\nD 180 min 160 min\nE 220 min 200 min\nF 264 min 240 min\nFigure 4 The vibration waveform associated with different test intervals.\nFigure 5 FFT of the signals at different interval [10Hz-300Hz]\nFigure 6 Vibration frequency spectrum\nFigure 7 The envelop spectrum of the Vibration signals filtered at 1570 Hz\nAlthough performing envelop analysis in conjunction with band-pass filtering was\nsuccessful in discriminating the BPF, prior knowledge of entire frequency spectrum\nand location of dominant amplitude across the spectrum is essential for selection of\nthe most effective filter frequency. Furthermore, since the presence of random\nGaussian noise can affect the resolution of frequency spectrum, and this can vary at\nthe different stages of mechanical integrity, the estimation of the optimum filter\nfrequency can be challenging. This is very important when dealing with the intelligent\nmonitoring systems, in which automatic selection of filter frequencies can be\nsignificantly influenced by the level of signal-to-noise ratio. Indeed, the key to\nperforming an effective envelop analysis is to choose an effective band-pass filter and\nsince the rolling bearings in practice are operated under different working conditions\n(speed and load), a generic band-pass filter with fixed parameters (Centre frequency\nand Band width) will not be sensitive enough to perform a compelling diagnosis [14].\nOne such method for optimal filter selection is the spectral Kurtogram.\nIn order to improve the denoising of vibration signals the concept of Spectral\nKurtosis (SK) was employed. This involves calculating the Kurtogram for each signal\nfrom which the bandwidth and centre frequency required to design a band-pass filter\nare determined. The criterion was set such that the frequency and bandwidth (Window\nsize) at which the spectral kurtosis of the signal is maximum was employed to build a\nnew band pass filter. The determination of SK was based on the algorithm developed\nby Antoni [15, 16]. A sample Kurtogram of signals at an early stage (A) and upon the\ntermination (F) of tests are presented in figure 8. The centre frequency (Fc) at \u2018F\u2019 was\nsignificantly higher than at interval \u2018A\u2019 suggesting a change in the impulsive vibration\nnature as the defect matured.\nFigure 8 The Kurtogram for Test-1; time intervals \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019\nFrom the SK analysis the centre frequency together with bandwidth for the time\nintervals A-F were calculated and listed in table 2. In addition, the Kurtosis values\nassociated with the centre frequencies are also presented. The Window size is the\nlength of data points within that particular window within which the STFT of the\nsignal and corresponding SK values were estimated (equations 1-3). Whilst the centre\nfrequency is the frequency at which the calculated SK value, at that particular\nwindows size, is maximized. It is believed that the higher SNR is achieved at this\ncentre as it matches one of the system natural frequency [12].\nTable 2 Estimated features from Kurtogram\nTest 1 Test 2\nFc(Hz) Nw Kurt Fc(Hz) Nw Kurt\nA 1875 32 1.8 1875 32 3.4\nB 1875 32 1.7 1875 32 1.7\nC 1875 32 3.4 1875 32 1.6\nD 625 32 2.4 1875 32 1.9\nE 2812 32 3.3 2187 32 3.7\nF 3125 11 0.8 2187 32 1.9\nNw: Window size Kurt: Kurtosis Fc: Centre Frequency\nThe signals were band- pass filtered at the determined centre frequencies, which were\nbased on the extracted features from the Kurtogram, and resulting time waveforms are\npresented in figures 9-101. From the figures it was evident that filtered signals offered\na higher level of signal to noise ratio showing the capability of SK based filtering for\ndenoising. To quantify the improvements in signal-to-noise Crest factor (CF) values\nwere compared before and after filtering. The CF defined as the ratio of the peak\nvalue divided by the signal r.m.s which gives an indication of signal peak-to-average\nratio. CF is a traditional method of measuring the smoothness of a signal and\ntherefore a faulty bearing will generate a spiky signal profile resulting an increase in\nCF .\n1 The Window-based finite impulse response filter was employed for filtering. The size of window used\nto design the filter was equal to that calculated from the Kurtogram of each signal.\nFigure 11, shows the values of CF for filtered and unfiltered signals in which an\naverage increase in CF levels of approximately of 264% and 250 % were noted for\nTest-1 and Test-2 respectively after bandpass filtering.\nFigure 9 Vibration waveform for test 1 (Filtered designed based on Kurtogram)\nFigure 10 Vibration waveform for test 2 (Filter designed based on Kurtogram)\nFigure 11 CF values associated with filtered and unfiltered signals\nFigure 12 The relative increase in level Kurtosis values after Band-pass filtering\nThe Kurtosis values of the signals at intervals \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018F\u2019 prior to and after filtering are\nalso presented in figure 12 showing a 70% and 95% average rise in Kurotsis values\nas a result of band pass filtering for Test-1 and Test-2. This agrees with observation\nfrom figures 9 and 10 where the presences of spikes were more evident on the filtered\nwaveforms. The squared envelop of the signals, for both test, were calculated and the\ncorresponding frequency spectrum of the enveloped signals are also presented in\nfigure 13 in which the defect frequency is clearly marked upon the termination of both\ntest. The capability of discriminating the BPF in the corresponding envelop spectrum\nclearly indicates the effectiveness of SK in diagnosing the fault frequency. In\ncomparison to the envelop spectrum presented earlier in figure 7 it is evident that the\nlevel filtering offered by the Kurtogram had improved earlier detection of the defect\nfrequency, at interval \u2018D\u2019 which is much earlier than noted in figure 7. For Test-2 the\nSK-based filter did not offer any improvement in earlier detection of the defect\nfrequency suggesting a limitation in its denoising effectiveness.\nFigure 13 Envelope spectrum of the SK filtered signals\n5. Acoustic emission\nFrom figure 2 it was noted an initial increase in AE r.m.s levels between 0-12min for\nTest-1 and 0-30 min for Test-2. The initial raise in r.m.s values is associated with the\nrun-in stage of the bearings after which the AE activity remained constant for period\nof 18mins and 2-hrs for first and second tests respectively. For the first test, the level\nof AE r.m.s started to increase after approximately 1hr into operation suggesting the\nonset of failure. A similar observation was noted for second test after 3hrs of\ncontinuous running. Comparing the overall trend of vibration and AE r.m.s, it is\nevident that the AE is more sensitive in monitoring the progression of the defect. In\naddition, AE levels increased approximately one hour before the vibration levels\nbegan to change.This was noted in both tests, for instance in test-1 AE levels started\nto increase at 3hrs of operation whilst vibration levels increased after 4hrs at\noperation. It must be noted that these are accelerated failure tests and the difference\nin period between these techniques (AE and vibration) in identification of the defect\nwill most certainly be much longer for non-accelerated test conditions.\nThe AE signals for different intervals, as set in table 3, were chosen for further\nanalysis, see figure 14. Interestingly, for Test-1 at time period \u2018F\u2019, the AE waveform\nshowed large transient bursts spaced at one of the bearing defect frequencies. This is a\nclassical AE bearing defect phenomenon as noted by several investigators [6, 8, 17].\nHowever, for the second test, the underlying noise level obscures any apparent high\ntransient events in the waveform.\nTable 3\nTest 1 Test 2\nA 35 min 42 min\nB 70 min 87 min\nC 105 min 132 min\nD 140 min 174 min\nE 175 min 219 min\nF 210 min 267 min\nFigure 14 The AE waveform at different time intervals\nThe frequency spectrum of recorded AE signals show the AE activity is concentrated\nbetween 50- 450 kHz, see figure 15. In order to identify any modulating features, the\nenvelop spectrum of the signals were generated using the Hilbert transform. The plots\nof envelop spectrums for both tests are presented in figure 16. Results from the first\ntest show the presence of the BPF and its harmonics. Surprisingly the presence of the\ndefect frequency 175 Hz, was noted for all the timing intervals (A-F) although the\nmagnitude of the peak increased with time reaching a maximum at the termination of\nthe test . For the second test, the presence of the harmonics noted in the first test were\nnot evident though the second and forth harmonics were noted at the end of the test,\ntime interval \u2018F\u2019. The reason for inadequate clarity in discriminating of the harmonics\nand fault frequency is attributed to the presence of noise and therefore a lower signal-\nto-noise ratio than Test-1.It is worth to mention that, although the two test were quite\ndistinct in the level of SNR; but the observation of the increase on two AE trends in\nfigure 2 and also the harmonics of BPF across the envelop spectrum, upon the\ntermination of the both tests clarifies the effective measurement of AE signals.\nFigure 15 Frequency spectrum of the AE signal\nFigure 16 The AE envelop spectrum for the first and second tests\nAs with the vibration analysis, the SK analysis was undertaken for the AE waveforms.\nTable 5 shows the optimum frequency bands for time intervals \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018F\u2019. According\nto the table, the optimum centre frequencies associated with undamaged race (A-E)\nwere outside the sensor measurement range. This is because for the undamaged\nbearing the higher frequencies within the sensor measurement range are\npredominately gaussian so the maximum Kurtosis value occurs at the lower frequency\nrange, below 30 kHz to 40 kHz.\nTable 3 Optimum Bandwidth and Centre frequency for AE signal\nTest 1 Test 2\nFc (Hz) )(log2 Nw Fc (Hz) )(log2 Nw\nA 39062 7.5 31250 7\nB 31250 7 31250 7.5\nC 31250 7 65185 12.5\nD 31250 7.5 31250 7.5\nE 31250 7.5 15625 8\nF 714843 8.5 61523 10.5\nThe filtered waveforms are presented in figure 17 showing a significant improvement\nin level of SNR compared with the unfiltered signals in figure 14. This is also\nmanifested in figure 18 in which an average of approximately 242% and 95%\nincrease in CF values were noted for the filtered signals on Test-1 and Test-2\nrespectively. Furthermore, figure 19 illustrates the envelope spectrum of the filtered\nsignals based on SK analysis. The BPF and its second harmonic were present across\nthe frequency spectrum for both tests while such observations were not noted for the\nunfiltered envelope spectrum in figure 16.\nFigure 17 AE waveforms associated with filtered signals\nFigure 18 CF values associated with filtered and unfiltered signals\n.Figure 19 Envelope spectrum of the SK-based filtered signals\nHaving noted the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio particularly for Test-2, the\nauthors compared the SK to wavelet-based filter analysis. The AE signals were\ndecomposed using Debauches wavelet of order 8 (db8). The reason for choosing db8\nas a mother wavelet is firstly because of being orthogonal and secondly the shape of it\nis close to the mechanical impulse [18]. The envelop spectrum at each level of\ndecomposition (D1-9) were carefully studied and level D1 (500 kHz - 1000 kHz) was\nfound to be the most sensitive for identifying the presence of the defect. The envelop\nspectrums of the signals at D1 are presented in figure 20 in which BPF and its\nharmonics are evident upon the termination of both test.\nFigure 20 Envelop spectrum of the AE signals at D1\nThe CF values for the original filtered (SK) and decomposed (db8) signals are\npresented in figure 21. In comparison to the original values of CF, the SK filtered\nsignals showed an increase in CF of approximately 242% and 95% for Test-1 and\nTest-2 respectively. Crest factor values noted for decomposed signals (D1) were in\nthe order of 18% and 70% for Test-1 and Test-2 respectively; implying the SK offered\nthe optimum filtered characteristics for identifying impulsive effects, which are\ntypically associated with defective bearings. The waveforms together with CF values\nat interval \u2018F\u2019 for D1, the original unfiltered waveform and the filtered waveform\n(SK) are also presented in figure 22 in which the presence of impulsive AE events\nassociated with the defective bearing are most evident for the SK filtered signals.\nThere was only one instance where the wavelet based filter had a better CF than the\nSK filtered data (Test-1, interval \u2018F\u2019). This observation reinforced the benefits of\napplying the SK for defect diagnosis for varying signal-to-noise ratio.\nFigure 21 CF value attribute to different diagnostic methods\nFigure 22 Comparison between D1 and filtered signals at interval \u2018F\u2019\n6. Conclusion\nThe applicability of both Acoustic Emission and Vibration methods were studied in\nrelation to defect identification of a naturally damaged bearing. From observation it\nwas evident that AE was more sensitive in detecting incipient damage than vibration\nreinforcing other investigators [19]. Furthermore, the application of SK analysis and\nKurtogram was investigated and it showed the effectiveness in denoising the both AE\nand vibration signals. The use of the Kurtogram for AE bearing analysis is\nencouraging and its hoped future researchers explore its full potential.\nReferences\n[1] Behzad, M., AlandiHallaj, A., Bastami, A.
