These additional C stocks should be verifiable. In this work, we assess \nthe feasibility of verifying the effects of changes in land use or management practice \non soil organic carbon (SOC), by comparing minimum detectable changes in SOC \nconcentration for existing European networks suitable for soil monitoring. Among the \ntested scenarios the minimum detectable changes differed considerably amongst soil \nmonitoring networks. Considerable effort would be necessary for some member \nstates to reach acceptable levels of minimum detectable change for C sequestration \naccounting. For SOC, a time interval of about 10 years would enable the detection of \nsome simulated large changes in most European countries. In almost all cases, the \nminimum detectable change in SOC stocks remains greater than annual greenhouse \ngases emissions. Therefore, it is unlikely that soil monitoring networks could be used \nfor annual national C accounting. However, the importance of organic C in soil \nfunctions, and as an indicator of soil condition and trends, underlines the importance \nof establishing effective national soil monitoring networks. \n \n 3\n1 Introduction 20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \nWithin the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change articles 3.3 \nand 3.4 stipulate that some voluntary activities leading to an additional carbon (C) \nsequestration in soils could be accounted as C sinks in national greenhouse gas \ninventories. Such additions to accounted C stocks would have to be verifiable: their \naccounting is conditional on meeting a requirement to verify the sequestration \nclaimed. Smith (2004) reviewed possible definitions of the verifiability of C sinks and \nsources in soils and, at its most stringent, verification would entail such a large \nnumber of measurements, that the resources needed would be prohibitively \nexpensive. This is certainly true, if specific regulatory sampling and testing is done. \n \nA recent review of European soil monitoring networks (SMNs) has been carried out \nwithin the ENVASSO project - ENVironmental ASsessment of Soil for mOnitoring - \n(Kibblewhite et al. 2005). ENVASSO has been funded under the European Union\u2019s \n6th Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development and has shown \nthat, in most countries in Europe, official systems for comprehensive soil monitoring \nexist already, are planned, or are under development. In this context, soil monitoring \nis defined as \u2018continuous or repeated observation, measurement, and evaluation of \nsoil and\/or related environmental or technical data for defined purposes, according to \nprearranged schedules in space and time, using standardized methods for data \ncollection and analysis\u2019 and a soil monitoring network is defined as \u2018A spatial \narrangement of soil monitoring sites, designed to be representative of soil type, land 41 \nuse and climatic zones; the spatial arrangement maybe random or on a regular grid\u2019 \n(ENVASSO 2007). Most existing national monitoring systems have undertaken a \nsingle sampling only, and thus they remain inventories at present. Most of these \n42 \n43 \n44 \n 4\n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \nsystems have measured soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, in addition to \nother soil properties, and are geo-referenced with sufficient precision for repeat \nsampling campaigns. \n \nIn relation to climate change, or to changes in land use or cultivation practices, SOC \ncontent may increase or decrease and a major issue is to assess whether these \nchanges are detectable by soil monitoring taking, into account the uncertainties \ncaused by spatial heterogeneity, sampling methods and analytical errors. Indeed, the \nevaluation of the confidence with which changes in SOC content can be detected is \nimportant for the implementation of EC Directives, national treaties, emissions trading \nschemes, and a posteriori validation of predicted changes using modelling. The \nspatial variability of SOC content strongly influences the ability to detect changes \n(Conant& Paustian 2002a, 2002b, Conant et al. 2003). At the field scale, numerous \nstudies have addressed this issue (see for example, (2002b, Conant et al. 2003, \nConen et al. 2003, Garten & Wullscheleger 1999, Saby & Arrouays 2004, Smith \n2004). At a regional or national scale, it is necessary to assess the effect of the \nnumber of sites and of inherent soil spatial variability on the detection of a change in \nSOC (see for example Saby & Arrouays 2004 and Bellamy et al. 2005). To our \nknowledge, such an assessment has never been performed at a continental scale. \n \nThe relatively dense (5 km x 5 km) soil monitoring network of England and Wales, \nthe National Soil Inventory (NSI) described by McGrath and Loveland (1992), has \nrecently been shown to be effective for recording aggregate SOC losses from these \ncountries between 1978 and 2003 (Bellamy et al. 2005). However, the density of soil \nmonitoring sites varies considerably between European countries. In this paper, we \n 5\nassess the feasibility of verifying the effects of changes in land use or soil \nmanagement practice on SOC content, by comparing minimum detectable levels of \nchange in SOC concentrations for existing European networks suitable for soil \nmonitoring, based on the information collected during the ENVASSO project. It is \nbelieved that ENVASSO has identified most soil monitoring networks in Europe but \nsome are known to have been excluded because of data confidentiality and problems \nof national coordination (Morvan et al. 2008). \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n2.1 78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n2 Materials and methods \nTheory \nWe assume that the soil monitoring sites identified within each country will be \nrevisited on a second and subsequent occasions as this is the most efficient way of \nmonitoring change (Lark et al. 2006). This means for a monitoring network in which \neach site is visited at least twice there is a paired sample situation and the change at \neach site can be calculated. For any particular monitoring network of a variable x, n \nsites are sampled at time t0 and again at time t1. An estimate of the mean change ( d ) \nin x is  \n84 \n85 \nnxxd ti\nn\ni\nti \/)( 10 ,\n1\n,\u2211\n=\n\u2212=  (1) 86 \n87 where xi,t is the measurement at site i at time t and n is the number of sites in the \nmonitoring network. An estimate of the standard error of d  is \nn\nsd\n2\nwhere sd2 is an \nestimate of the variance of the differences (de Gruijter et al. 2006) . However, it is not \npossible to estimate this variance directly as we know very little about the variation of \nchange in SOC concentrations at European scale, as currently most soil monitoring \nnetworks within Europe are inventories. An alternative estimate of the standard error \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n 6\nof d  is n\ns 22\n, where s2 is an estimate of the variance of x on the first occasion. This \nalternative estimate requires us to assume that this variance does not change over \ntime and that the correlation between the two sampling times is small. In this paper \nthe latter assumption is investigated for SOC concentration using data from the NSI \nof England and Wales. However, this estimate of the standard error of the mean \nchange is conservative and has been calculated in the same way for all countries to \ncompare their monitoring networks. \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n \nAssuming a normal distribution for the mean change in SOC concentration (invoking \nthe Central Limit Theorem), estimates of a 100(1-\u03b1)% confidence interval for this \nmean change can be written (Barnett 2002): \nnszdDnszd \/2\/2 \u03b1\u03b1 +<<\u2212   (2) 104 \n105 \n106 \nwhere z\u03b1 is the value of the standardized normal distribution at probability \u03b1. \nThe condition for detection of a mean change y is that  \n 0\/2 >\u2212 nszy \u03b1  that is nszy \/2\u03b1>  107 \n108 and hence the minimum detectable change (MDC) is \nnszy \/2\u03b1=  (3) 109 \n110 \n111 \nWith the assumption that the SOC concentration is changing at an estimated rate of \nchange k and that this is constant over the whole time interval t, then \nnk\nszt 2\u03b1>  112 \n113 and the minimum time to detect a given rate of change k is \nnk\nszt 2\u03b1=  (4) 114 \n 7\n115 \n116 \nEquation 3 can also be used to estimate the number of sites required to detect a \ncertain level of change y i.e. \n2\n222\ny\nsz\nn \u03b1>  (5) 117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n2.2 Data 131 \n132 \n133 \n2.2.1 134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n \nIf the assumption made above is valid, (i.e. that the correlation between repeated \nsamplings is small), the variance s2 described above is the natural heterogeneity of \nSOC concentration across the landscape, as well as the variation due to the \nmeasurement of SOC concentration. It has been found that the best estimate of s2 is \na combination of the estimate of the landscape variation from previous studies \ns2landscape and the expected measurement errors (see Ramsey 1998). All these \nsources of error can be assumed to be independent so that \n2222\nlandscapesa ssss ++=   (6) \nwhere s2a is the analytical variance and s2s is the sampling variance from the \nsampling of the soil in the field. s2a + s2s can be assumed to be the within-site \nvariability. The within-site variability needs to be quantified as it can make a \nsignificant contribution to the overall variation. \nThe following sources of data were used to estimate the minimum detectable \nchanges in SOC concentration across Europe: \nSoil monitoring networks in Europe \nA metadata collection was conducted by means of a questionnaire completed by \nENVASSO partners from 25 European countries, providing information on national \nsoil monitoring networks (SMNs), their site sampling designs, the geo-reference of \nthe monitoring sites, the parameters measured at each site and the number of \n 8\nsampling campaigns (Morvan et al. 2007). Where possible, descriptive statistics \n(mean, median, standard deviation) were also collected for each parameter within \neach country, categorised by three land use classes (arable, forest, pasture) and \npeat soils. \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n2.2.2 144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n \nMetadata of within-site variation \nTo obtain estimates of the sampling variance (s2s) and the analytical variance (s2a), \nwe conducted a meta-analysis of published and some unpublished data. The \nfollowing relevant factors were included in the compilation: area of the site (ranging \nfrom 1 m2 to 20 ha), number of samples, mean values of soil parameters, indication \nof within-site variability (i.e. variance, or standard deviation, or coefficient of \nvariation). We also extracted data on analytical variability when available. Literature \nsearches were performed using the electronic database \u201cWeb of Science\u201d. Some \nunpublished data were also supplied by ENVASSO partners (mainly from France and \nSlovakia) and we excluded references to tropical soils. One hundred and twenty sites \nwere retained. The data were used to derive quantitative estimates of the mean \nvalues, variances, standard deviations and coefficients of variation for all available \nparameters. We examined the possible relationships between within-site variability \nand site area and\/or mean values. From these relationships we derived estimates of \nthe coefficient of variations for all the sites for which the area was known. \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n2.2.3 160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n \nDigital map of organic carbon in top soils across Europe \nJones et al. (2005) developed a methodology for estimating organic carbon \nconcentrations (%) in topsoils (OCTOP) across Europe. The information presented in \nmap form (Jones et al. 2004) is also available as a database which can be \n 9\ndownloaded from the EU-soils web site (http:\/\/eusoils.jrc.it) hosted by the Joint \nResearch Centre, Ispra (I). The OCTOP map and database provide policy-makers \nwith estimates of current topsoil OC concentrations when developing strategies for \nsoil protection at regional level. Although the methodology used to compile OCTOP is \nbased on pedotransfer functions, the results have been validated using SOC \nconcentrations from more than 12,000 sites in England and Wales (from the NSI), \nand Italy. Statistical analysis showed that 95% of the variation in the estimated SOC \nconcentrations, aggregated on the basis of European soil map units (SMU), was \naccounted for by the measured SOC concentration from the detailed inventories \nconducted in these countries (Jones et al. 2005). Therefore, these baseline data \nwere used to estimate national distributions of soil organic carbon (SOC). Processing \nof data was performed on harmonized spatial data layers in raster format with a \n1 km \u00d7 1 km grid spacing. Using SOC concentration values on this 1km grid, the \nvariances were calculated for each country. We set the initial SOC concentration \nvalue for each monitoring site identified in the ENVASSO project, to the topsoil OC \n(OCTOP) predicted by Jones et al. (2005) because the data from the individual sites \nwere not available for reasons of confidentiality. \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n3.1 184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n \n \n3 Results \nInvestigation into assumptions made in the methodology \nOne of the main findings of the ENVASSO survey of SMN\u2019s across Europe was that \nvery few had actually been resampled (Morvan et al. 2007, Morvan et al.). This \nmeant that it was impossible to estimate sd2 (the standard error of mean change) \ndirectly. Only the NSI for England and Wales, has been resampled for SOC \n 10\n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \nconcentration and, thus the assumption that the correlation of SOC concentrations \nbetween sampling times is small, could be examined. Table 1 shows the standard \ndeviations of the original NSI sample of SOC concentrations; the resampled SOC \nconcentrations, standardised to cover the same interval at all sites; and the \ndifference at each site. It can be seen that under arable agriculture the assumption is \nreasonable (an over-estimation of 15%), but the standard deviation is over-estimated \nby 30% for grassland and by more than 100% under forest. Since these are all over-\nestimations, the estimate of minimum detectable change will also be an over-\nestimate and, as long as the same methodology is applied across Europe, the results \nwill be comparable. \n \nThe data collected from the ENVASSO survey was comprehensive regarding the \nnumber and geographical location of monitoring sites, but few countries supplied \nsummary statistics of their data. Therefore, the variation of SOC concentrations at \nthe landscape scale had to be estimated from the digital map of topsoil OC across \nEurope. To examine the effect of using this methodology on the results, the data from \nthe few countries supplying summary statistics were used to estimate the minimum \ndetectable change (MDC) within land use classes and this was compared with the \nMDC calculated using the SOC map. Figure 1 shows the results for England & Wales \n(treated as one country), Hungary, Romania, France, Belgium, and Austria. The \nMDC is not well estimated for soils under forest in those countries with large areas of \nforest, however, the estimate using the European OCTOP map falls between those \nfor arable and grassland for all countries, except Belgium where it is slightly smaller. \nThe original assumption that there is a weak correlation between sample values led \nto estimates derived using the summary statistics for each country being over \n 11\nestimates, particularly for forest soils. The estimation of variation from OCTOP is not \naffected by extreme values because it is derived from a combination of soil, climate \nand land use data on a 1 km x 1 km grid rather than from point samples (monitoring \nsites) and as such is a more robust estimator. The MDC for the only country for \nwhich information on the variation of change was available, England & Wales, is also \nshown in Figure 1 (as E & W_res), where the MDC is estimated using the directly \nestimated variance of differences at individual sites. It is impossible to draw \nconclusions from one dataset but this result does indicate that the estimate of MDC, \nusing the estimate of variance from OCTOP, gives a reasonable estimate of MDC for \nOC concentration of soil under grassland and arable land use.  \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n3.2 225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n3.3 231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n \nWithin-site variability \nWe found a strong relationship between the within-site variability of SOC \nconcentration and the site area. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the \ncoefficients of variation of SOC concentration and the area of sites, grouped into area \nclasses. The analytical value (1) corresponds to the coefficient of variation obtained \nby re-analysing the same sample several times.  \nNational variances \nNational variances of values of topsoil SOC concentration predicted across Europe \nusing OCTOP show a marked effect of latitude (Figure 3). The northern countries \nhave very high standard deviations, which can be related to the existence of soils \nwith very high SOC concentration (peat soils) and very low SOC concentrations in \nsome intensively cropped areas. By contrast, soils in Mediterranean countries are \n 12\ngenerally characterised by lower and more uniform SOC concentrations with smaller \nstandard deviations. \n237 \n238 \n3.4 239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n3.5 257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \nNumber of monitoring sites \nFigure 4 and Table 1 show the heterogeneous distribution of the monitoring sites for \nSOC concentration for each country reported by an ENVASSO partner. Some \ncountries have relatively dense networks (e.g. England and Wales, Northern Ireland, \nAustria, Denmark, Malta), whereas in other countries soil monitoring sites are \nrelatively scarce (Spain, Italy, Greece). Some ENVASSO partners reported forest \nsites only, generally belonging to the International Co-operative Programme (ICP) on \nForest Soil Condition Survey in Europe (Vanmechelen et al. 1997), although the \ncountries represented are known to have implemented SMNs more widely than just \non forest land. For example, detailed information was not obtainable for some SMNs \nsuch as those described by Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al (2005) for Spain, and by Filippi (2005) for \nItaly, whereas information on site coordinates is also lacking for agricultural areas in \nSweden or Belgium (Van Orshoven et al. 1993). Topsoil OC concentration was \nmeasured at 33,334 monitoring sites, representing 92 % of the monitoring sites \nidentified by ENVASSO, making the topsoil OC indicator one of the most widely \navailable indicators of soil status in Europe. Only SMNs in Austria, Estonia, Finland, \nGermany and Slovenia reported that topsoil OC was not measured at all monitoring \nsites. \nMinimum detectable change \nThe minimum detectable change (MDC) using \u03b1 equal to 0.05 was highly variable \namongst SMNs (see Figure 5). As expected, the highest values of MDC for SOC \nconcentration were observed in countries having very organic soils and\/or having \n 13\nvery few sites measuring this indicator. Six countries show a MDC larger than 10 \ngC.kg\n261 \n262 \n263 \n3.6 264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n-1. The large MDC observed for both Estonia and Slovenia would be reduced if \nSOC concentrations were measured at all the existing monitoring sites. \nNumber of sites required \nThe policy process requires the number of sites, by country necessary to achieve a \ngiven MDC. We estimated the number of sites (n1) required to detect a relative \nchange of 5 % in the national mean of topsoil OC concentration, which was chosen \nbecause it is the requirement for monitoring soil in the UK (Environment Agency \n2007). Table 2 shows that n1 mainly depends on country area and on the variability of \nSOC concentrations within the country, such that a total of 57,628 sites would be \nrequired for the EU-27 countries. If we compare this estimate to the actual number of \nsites, n, where measurements of SOC concentration are undertaken currently, we \ncan deduce an estimate of the additional number of sites, n2 that would be needed in \neach country to achieve this level of detectable of change. Except for some countries \nwhere relatively dense SMNs exist already, most of the countries would have to \nmake considerable efforts to be in a position to detect a 5 % relative change in SOC \nconcentration. \n \nUsing the data available, it is possible to do the same calculation for any desired \nrelative change we might wish to detect. Table 3 shows that except for Malta, the \nnumber of sites needed to detect a 1 % relative change would exceed 20,000 in all \nnational cases, and more than 170,000 in Norway, which would be prohibitive under \ncurrent circumstances. At the European scale, the number of sites needed would be \nclose to 1,000,000. \n 14\n3.7 285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \nTime required to detect a given change \nWith the following assumptions: (i) that a variable is changing at an estimated rate of \nchange k; (ii) that this is constant over the whole time interval between samplings \nand over the whole of Europe; and (iii) if we assume a given number of sites and \u03b1 \nequal to 0.05, it is possible to calculate the time necessary to detect a given change. \nEquation 4 was used to develop an example based on a study from Bellamy et al \n(2005). This showed very large changes in SOC concentrations across England and \nWales, from 1978 to 2003. They used data from the National Soil Inventory of \nEngland and Wales obtained during two sampling campaigns, the first during the \nperiod 1978-83 (McGrath et al. 1992) and the second 1995-2003. Bellamy et al \n(2005) demonstrated that OC has been lost from soils across England and Wales at \na mean rate of 0.6% yr-1 (relative to the existing SOC concentration), over the period \n1979-2003. They also found that the relationship between rate of C loss and initial \nOC concentration was independent of land use, suggesting a link to environmental \nchange. By supposing that such a change is occurring throughout Europe, it is \npossible to calculate the time interval needed to allow detection of this change, either \nby using existing SMNs, or as described previously by simulating the existence of \nadditional sites. \n \nFor most countries with relatively dense SMNs, the time necessary to detect such a \nchange is below or close to 10 yr (Figure 6). This result supports the idea that, at \nleast for these more dense SMNs, and assuming a relatively large change in this \nparameter, a time interval of 10 yr would be efficient. The cases of Estonia and \nSlovenia give a good example of the importance of archiving samples.

These assumptions have been \ninvestigated as far as possible using the available data and it has been shown that a \nreasonable estimate of the MDC for soils under arable and grassland, in each \ncountry, can be made. They are also essential to enable estimates to be made from \nthe available data that are comparable across Europe. \n \nIt was also assumed that within-site variability is only dependant on site area and the \nmean value of SOC concentration, and that these relationships hold throughout \nEurope. This is likely to be false, as it is well known that numerous other factors may \ncontrol OC variability at site level (e.g. climate effects on soil drainage status, land-\nuse, soil type, management practices, etc.). However, using literature values for \nestimating a within-site variance should not greatly affect the results obtained, as the \nmeasured within-site variation is much smaller than the between-site national \nvariation. \n \n 16\nAlthough Bellamy et al. (2005) explored how their results for England and Wales, \nshowing a relatively rapid rate of change in SOC concentration, might be \nextrapolated to similar soils and climates, there is no quantitative evidence that such \nchanges are widespread across the soils of Europe. Our study shows the magnitude \nof change in SOC concentration that might be detectable at continental and regional \nscales. Policy makers might be interested in knowing the changes in OC stocks and \nassociated fluxes represented by this change, for example in the context of a Soil \nFramework Directive (COM 2006). An estimate of topsoil OC stocks across Europe \ncan be obtained from the database of Jones et al. (2005) and application of \npedotransfer functions of the type proposed by Adams (1973) and pedotransfer rules \nof the type defined by Van Ranst et al. (1995) to estimate bulk densities. If the \ncalculated MDC by country is added to the estimate of topsoil OC concentration and \nthe estimation of soil bulk density is repeated, the difference between these \nestimated stocks represents the magnitude of change that is detectable in the \nEuropean stocks of topsoil OC. Table 3 shows that for most of the countries, \ndetectable changes range from 1 to 10% in the base estimate of stock. These \nchanges are very similar to the projected changes (about 6%) simulated by Smith et \nal. (2007) in mineral soil C of European Russia and Ukraine\u2019s croplands and \ngrasslands over the last ten years of their simulation (2060-2069), under the \nbusiness as usual scenario. This suggests that over about 10 years most of the \nexisting SMNs could be used to verify such changes. However, it would be important \nto measure bulk density wherever possible during monitoring to allow better \nestimates of carbon stock to be made. It was found in the ENVASSO survey that bulk \ndensity was measured at less than 10% of the monitoring sites so future soil \nmonitoring programmes need to address this. Over shorter timescales, most of these \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n 17\nnetworks could only detect changes of more than the total national annual \ngreenhouse gas emissions.

Assuming this \nrate of change, its statistical assessment using the present French SMN would take \nabout 45 years.  \nConclusion  \nThe important role of carbon in soil functions and as an indicator of soil condition and \ntrends underlines the importance of effective national soil monitoring networks that \ncould contribute to developing an overall European picture of long term trends in soil \norganic carbon. Our results suggest that the minimum detectable changes in SOC \nconcentration differ considerably amongst soil monitoring networks in Europe. \nConsiderable effort would be necessary for some countries to reach acceptable \nlevels of minimum detectable changes in C concentration. A time interval of about \n10 years would enable the detection, in most European countries, of some large \nsimulated changes in topsoil OC concentration. National soil monitoring networks are \nnot suitable to detect annual changes in soil carbon stocks but would allow longer \nterm assessments. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work has been conducted under the European 6th Framework Programme of \nResearch ENVASSO Project Contract no 022713.
