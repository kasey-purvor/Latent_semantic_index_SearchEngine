These are: i) location (errors in relocating the sample site), ii)3\nsampling errors (representing the site with a sample of material) iii) subsampling error4\n(selecting material for analysis) and iv) analytical error (error in laboratory measure-5\nments). In general we cannot separate the subsampling and analytical sources of error6\n(since we always analyse a different subsample of a specimen), so in this paper we7\ncombine these two sources into subsampling plus analytical error. More information8\nis required on the relative magnitudes of location and sampling errors for the design9\nof effective resampling strategies to monitor changes in soil indicators. Recently com-10\npleted soil surveys of the UK with widely differing soils included a duplicate site and11\nsubsampling protocol to quantify ii), and the sum of iii) and iv) above. Sampling vari-12\nances are estimated from measurements on duplicate samples \u2014 two samples collected13\non a support of side length 20 m separated by a short distance (21 m). Analytical14\nand subsampling variances are estimated from analyses of two subsamples from each15\nduplicate site.16\nAfter accounting for variation caused by region, parent material class and land17\nuse, we undertook a nested analysis of data from 196 duplicate sites across three18\nregions to estimate the relative magnitude of medium-scale (between site), sampling19\nand subsampling plus analytical variance components for five topsoil indicators: total20\nmetal concentrations of copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn), soil pH and soil organic21\ncarbon (SOC) content. The variance components for each indicator diminish by about22\nan order of magnitude from medium-scale, to sampling, to analytical plus subsampling.23\nEach of the three fixed effects (parent material, land use and region) were statistically24\nsignificant for each of the five indicators. The most effective way to minimise the overall25\nuncertainty of our observations at sample sites is to reduce the sampling variance.26\n2\nIntroduction27\nSoil monitoring activity is increasing because regulatory authorities recognise the need28\nto detect whether significant changes are occuring in properties of soil \u2014 and their29\nability to fulfil soil functions \u2014 due to a variety of anthropogenic drivers. The basic30\naim of soil monitoring is to quantify changes in selected soil properties or indicators31\nover time, and to make inferences regarding these changes. When we resample the soil32\nwe want to compare the baseline and resampled data in order to estimate change.33\nWhen we compare a baseline measurement of the soil with the resampled value34\nthere are various sources of error. A sample site is the small local area for which we35\nobtain a single value of the soil property of interest. This might be a single core but36\nmore typically it is a larger area, e.g. a square of sides 20 m, and we sample this by37\ncollecting several cores which are aggregated and then subsampled to obtain material38\nfor analysis. To resample we return to the site and then repeat this procedure. There39\nare various sources of error in the estimate of change at a sample site that is given by40\nthe difference between the baseline and resample values. First, there is location error. If41\nwe have not returned exactly to the original sample site then spatial variation between42\nthe two sites actually sampled will contribute uncertainty to our estimate. Second,43\nthere is what we may call sampling error. If we repeatedly resampled a site (at the44\nsame time), by the same procedure, then our different sample averages (obtained with45\nno further sources of error due, for example, to analysis) would vary due to sampling46\nerror. The magnitude of the sampling error depends on the sampling procedure; it47\ndecreases as we increase the number of cores that are aggregated and from which we48\ntake a subsample for analysis.49\nThe variance of these notional repeat sample averages is the sample error variance.50\nIn addition to this the material that we sample is thoroughly mixed, but subsampling51\nfor analysis introduces uncertainty too (different subsamples would have different val-52\nues). We call this the subsample error, which introduces subsample error variance. We53\nknow that multiple analyses of uniform material will not return exact results and the54\n3\nvariance of such multiple determinations is the analytical variance. Although separa-55\nble in theory, the subsample and analytical variance cannot be separated in practice.56\nAnalytical variance must be estimated by repeat analyses of uniform material, but soil57\nis never entirely uniform and so the resampling and analytical variances will always be58\nconfounded.59\nTwo published studies from the UK have attempted to provide estimates of the60\nmagnitude of sampling variances at survey sites. First, the relative proportions of61\nbetween-site, local (duplicate) and analytical variances for total concentrations of 2362\nelements in topsoil from 21 sites with common soil parent materials across part of63\nnorthern England were reported by Rawlins et al. (2002). They showed that the local,64\nsampling variance differed considerably for each element. Second, a study published65\nby Defra, (the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, in England and66\nWales) where sites from the National Soil Inventory were revisited and samples collected67\nat short intervals of 10 and 50 m (Defra, 2003). Based on analyses at ten sites, the68\nauthors concluded that there were significant differences between samples taken at these69\nintervals from the original target site for some of the parameters measured, including70\nSOC, pseudo-total Pb and Zn determined by aqua regia extraction.71\nBoth these studies, particularly the latter, have sample sizes much too small72\nto make confident general statements about the importance of different sources of73\nerror in determining soil properties. However, their results, while only indicative, are74\ninteresting, and provided a motivation to study the problem more thoroughly.75\nThe sampling protocol adopted by the UK Geochemical Baseline Survey of the76\nEnvironment (G-BASE) project and the recently completed Tellus soil survey of North-77\nern Ireland includes a procedure for quantifying both sampling (short-scale) and an-78\nalytical variances at 1 in every 100 locations in its systematic, unaligned sampling79\ndesign.80\nData are available on topsoil properties (including five soil indicators) at 196 sites81\nacross three large regions of the UK, comprising a diverse range of soil, mean annual82\n4\nrainfall, parent material and land use types. In such grid-based surveys, it is inevitable83\nthat location and sampling errors will be conflated.84\nAfter accounting for variation caused by region, parent material class and land85\nuse, we have undertaken a nested analysis to determine the relative magnitude of86\nsubsampling plus analytical and sampling variance components for five, tier-one topsoil87\nindicators identified in the UK (Environment Agency, 2006). These are total metal88\nconcentrations of copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn), soil pH and soil organic89\ncarbon (SOC) content. We present the results of our findings and comment on their90\nimplications for the design and implementation of soil monitoring.91\nMethods92\nStudy region and surveys93\nThe three regions (Figure 1) comprise a diverse range of soil parent materials and soil94\ntypes; further details of the soil types in Northern Ireland are provided by Cruickshank95\n(1997), whilst the soils in the study regions of England are described in three regional96\nbulletins (Soil Survey of England and Wales, 1983a-c). The major soil types in each97\nof the three regions are summarized in Table 1. The larger proportion of peat soils in98\nNorthern Ireland compared to the two regions in England reflects the wetter environ-99\nment of the former, where average mean annual rainfall for the vast majority of the100\nregion is greater than 1 m, with a minimum of around 0.75 m.101\nFor the soil surveys, a systematic, unaligned strategy was adopted in which one102\nsample was collected from a random location in every other 1 km square of the British103\nor Irish National Grids, subject to the avoidance of roads, tracks, buildings, railways,104\nelectricity pylons, and disturbed ground. One in every 100 of these sites was randomly105\nselected and designated a duplicate sampling site at which the following sampling106\nprotocol was adopted. The dominant land use was recorded at each duplicate sampling107\nlocation.108\nAt each sampling site, including those selected for duplicate sampling, five in-109\ncremental soil samples were collected using a Dutch auger at the corners and centre110\n5\nof a square with a side of length 20 m and combined to form a composite sample of111\napproximately 0.5 kg. At each of these five points, any surface litter was removed and112\nthe soil sampled to a depth of 15 cm into the exposed soil. In the case of organic-rich113\nsoil, 5 cm of surface litter was removed and the soil samples were collected from a114\ndepth range of 5 \u2013 20 cm. This composite sample is referred to as duplicate A (DUP115\nA). At each of the duplicate sites, another composite sample was collected from one of116\nfour squares with the same support. These squares are illustrated in Figure 2. Notice117\nthat the centres of each of them are 21 m from the centre of the square for the original118\nsample. The second sample square (1 of a possible 4) was selected randomly, and the119\nsame sampling procedure adopted; this composite sample is referred to as duplicate B120\n(DUP B).121\nAll samples of soil were air-dried in a dedicated temperature controlled oven at122\n30 \u25e6C for 2\u20133 days, disaggregated and sieved to <2 mm. The samples were coned and123\nquartered and each split into two sub-samples. The two samples from the DUP A124\nsite were labelled DUP A and SUB A, whilst the samples from the DUP B site were125\nlabelled DUP B and SUB B. From each of the four sub-samples, a 50-g sub-sample126\nwas ground in an agate planetary ball mill. The total concentrations of Ni, Cu and127\nZn were determined in each sample by wavelength and energy dispersive XRFS (X-128\nRay Fluorescence Spectrometry). The samples were prepared for analysis by grinding129\n12 g of sample material and 3 g of Elvacite 2013 (n-butyl methacrylate copolymer,130\nDupont & Co.) in an agate planetary ball mill for half an hour. The mixture was then131\npressed using a 25 tonne load into pellets with a thickness of 40 mm. The coefficients132\nof variation for a soil sample standard were: Ni (0.6 %) Cu ( 1%) and Zn (0.8 %).133\nSoil pH and SOC were only determined on a subset of 114 sites (a total of 456 sam-134\nples) from two of the regions; East Anglia and Northern Ireland. Soil organic carbon135\nwas estimated in each sample using loss-on-ignition analysis by heating a sub-sample to136\n450 \u25e6C for eight hours and multiplying the mass difference by 0.58 (Broadbent, 1953).137\nThe coefficient of variation for this method for 174 replicate analyses of a sample stan-138\n6\ndard was 3.6 %. The pH of each sample was measured using a glass electrode and139\nOrion 720A meter. To 10 g of the <2 mm sample, 25 ml of 0.01 M calcium chloride140\nsolution was added, the samples were magnetically stirred for one minute and then left141\nto settle for 15 minutes. Prior to recording the pH value, the suspension was stirred.142\nDigital layers of the 1:50,000 maps of bedrock geology and superficial deposits143\nof England, part of DigiMap GB (British Geological Survey, 2006) were combined in144\na GIS to form a series of parent material polygons. The parent material code for any145\nposition on the landscape can be found by assigning the code of any superficial deposit146\npresent, or where absent, the code of the bedrock geology. We devised a simple, seven-147\nfold parent material classification for all soil parent material types. In a GIS we used148\na spatial join procedure to associate each soil sampling observation with the relevant149\ncode of the parent material polygons (see Figure 3).150\nData analysis151\nOur data are collected according to a balanced nested sample design. Within every152\nrandomly selected sample location there is a pair of Duplicates (DUP A and DUP B),153\nand from each duplicate two subsamples are taken and analysed. Differences between154\nthe subsamples (within a duplicate) are due to the sources of uncertainty that we call155\nanalytical and subsampling error. Differences between duplicates within a site are due156\nto repeating the sampling procedure with a small shift in the position of the sampled157\nsquare. In this study we assume that this represents sampling error (although it will158\nbe slightly inflated by the 21-m shift). We require an analysis to estimate the variances159\nthat these different sources of uncertainty will contribute to our values for each site.160\nThere are two kinds of sources of variation in our data. Random effects arise161\nbecause they may be regarded as random processes due to our sampling. Coning162\nand quartering is regarded as a way of randomly subsampling material, the random163\nselection of one of four possible second squares to sample at each site is a random source164\nof variation (sampling error variation), and the random selection of sites for this more165\ndetailed investigation introduces what we shall call medium-scale spatial variation \u2014166\n7\nit is variation within the land uses, parent materials and regions. The second source167\nof variation arises from fixed effects which we chose to sample, including land uses,168\nparent materials and regions. They do not enter into our sampling in a random way,169\nbut because we chose to sample them.170\nLet us consider one of our observations. It is subsample k of duplicate j at site i171\nrandomly selected from sites in landuse c, parent material b within region a. Because172\nof our random sampling we regard that observation as a random variable Za,b,c,i,j,k. We173\ncan write an expression for this variable,174\nZa,b,c,i,j,k = \u00b5a,b,c +Qi +Ri,j + Si,j,k, (1)\nwhere \u00b5 is the overall mean of the variable for landuse c within parent material b175\nwithin region a, Qi is the difference between the mean for the ith randomly located176\nsite and the mean \u00b5a,b,c, Ri,j is the difference between the mean for duplicate j within177\nsite i and the mean for site i, and Si,j,k is the difference between subsample k within178\nduplicate j and the mean for duplicate j. The last three terms in the equation (shown179\nas upper-case letters) are random variables, all of mean zero, and each with a variance.180\nWe assume that these variances are uniform for all observations, and denote them by181\n\u03c32Q, \u03c3\n2\nR and \u03c3\n2\nS. They are respectively the medium-scale spatial variance, the sampling182\nvariance and the subsampling+analytical variance that we want to estimate.183\nWe estimated the fixed effects and the variance components for each random184\neffect using residual maximum likelihood. If we denote the m variance components by185\n\u03c32l , l = 1, 2, . . . ,m then we may write a covariance matrix for the observations V given186\nby187\nV =\nm\u2211\nl=1\n\u03c32lUlU\nT\nl , (2)\nwhere Ul is a design matrix for the lth fixed effect. If we have n observations, and at188\nlevel l of the nested structure there are nk units then Ul is a n\u00d7 nk matrix, and if the189\ngth observation is in the jth unit at level l then the element in the jth column of row190\ng in Ul is 1 and all the rest in that row are zero.191\n8\nLet X denote the design matrix for the fixed effects. This can be constructed in192\nvarious ways, and since our samples are all nested in a balanced way within the fixed193\neffects categories (i.e. all values from a particular site correspond to the same land use,194\nparent material and region), the precise fixed effects model that we construct from these195\nhas no effect on our estimates of the variances. For consistency with Equation (??),196\nif there are p unique combinations the regions, parent materials and land uses, then197\nX is an n \u00d7 p matrix. If the gth observation corresponds to the jth out of these p198\ncombinations then the element in the jth column of row g in X is 1 and all the rest in199\nthat row are zero.200\nWe can now write the log residual likelihood function corresponding to our model.201\nThis is a function of our data, conditional on the specified model, but with the fixed202\neffects filtered out so that the variance component estimates do not depend on them.203\nThis reduces bias in the variance estimates (see Webster et al., 2006). The residual log204\nlikelihood is205\n`R = \u22121\n2\n(\nlnV + ln\n\u2223\u2223\u2223XTV\u22121X\u2223\u2223\u2223+ zTPz) , (3)\nwhere z is the vector of data values and P is206\nP = V\u22121 \u2212V\u22121X\n(\nXTV\u22121X\n)\u22121\nXTV\u22121. (4)\nWe estimate the variance components numerically by finding the values which, when207\nused to compute V by means of Equation (??), maximize Equation (??).208\nWe examined summary statistics of the data; the three metals and organic carbon209\ndata had skewness coefficients > 1 and so we transformed them by taking natural210\nlogarithms to stabilize their variances, as is recommended in standard texts such as211\nWebster & Oliver (2007). In practice we might subsequently need to back-transform212\nestimates to the original units. However, for our present purpose, to investigate the213\nrelative magnitudes of different sources of uncertainty, the results on appropriately-214\ntransformed data are most reliable. The pH data were not transformed. We then215\nfound the REML estimates of the variance components using the vcomponents and216\n9\nreml directives in GenStat (Payne et al., 2008). This also returns standard errors for217\nthe variance components (root mean-square errors of the estimates). It also computes218\nWald tests on the fixed effects, which allows us to test the null hypotheses that, for219\nexample, the mean values do not differ between regions, landuses or parent materials.220\nResults and their interpretation221\nSummary statistics for the five topsoil indicators are shown in Table 2 by region and222\nfor all regions combined. The median metal concentrations (Cu, Ni, and Zn) in the223\ntopsoil of Northern Ireland are larger than those of the two English regions, which224\nreflects the occurrence in Northern Ireland of soils derived from basaltic bedrock and225\nsuperficial deposits over this lithology. The soils of Northern Ireland also have larger226\nmedian SOC concentrations and lower median pH values than those of East Anglia227\ndue to a combination of factors including parent material, climate and land use.228\nThe importance of the the three fixed effects (region, parent material and land229\nuse) on the five soil indicators is highlighted in Table 3. With the exception of land230\nuse and topsoil Zn concentrations (P-value=0.056), the test statistics for our null hy-231\npotheses are all significant (P-values < 0.05 ) for each fixed effect and soil indicator.232\nThe regional effect partly reflects the variations in the two other fixed effects (parent233\nmaterial and land use), although the differing climates and elevations for the three234\nregions are also likely to exert an influence, particularly for soil organic carbon and235\npH.236\nThe variance components for the three random effects are shown in Table 4. In237\neach case the standard errors are an order of magnitude smaller than their respective238\nvariance components. The variance components for each indicator diminish by about239\nan order of magnitude from medium-scale, to sampling, to analytical plus subsampling240\nvariance. In the case of Cu, the magnitude of the variance components are somewhat241\ndifferent to this general rule. The sampling variance of Cu is only three times smaller242\nthan the medium-scale variance, whilst the analytical plus subsampling variance is243\nabout 30-times smaller than the sampling variance. However, in common with the other244\n10\nindicators, the difference between the medium-scale and analytical plus subsampling245\nvariance for Cu is around two orders of magnitude. Further work would be required to246\nexplain the larger sampling variances for Cu in relation to those of Ni and Zn.247\nDiscussion248\nResults from the duplicate sampling protocol described in this study provide the first249\ncomprehensive estimates of local, sample error variance for five topsoil indicators at250\nthe regional scale. It should be borne in mind that the sample error variances are251\nsomewhat inflated because of the shift in location of 21 metres in one of four possible252\ndirections (see Figure 2). This could be thought of as an approximation to the location253\nerror. Further work is required to determine the relative magnitudes of locational error254\nand sampling error which are needed for effective resampling strategies of soil inventory255\nsites (Lark, this volume). This would require more detailed sampling on the support of256\nthe cores that are aggregated to form the site sample to characterize spatial variability257\nover the scales of the location error.258\nOur analyses confirm that the sampling error variance is substantially more im-259\nportant than the analytical and subsampling error (Ramsey, 1998), if we resample the260\nsoil to detect change with the field procedures used in the G-BASE and Tellus surveys.261\nIf, for some reason, we needed to reduce the overall uncertainty of our observations at262\nsample sites, (e.g. to reduce the confidence intervals for estimates of change to accept-263\nable levels) then the most effective way to do this is not by improving our analyses or264\nsubsampling protocols, but by doing all that we can to reduce the sampling variance.265\nThis could be done by increasing the number of cores that are collected and bulked for266\neach site.267\nConclusion268\nOur findings show that sampling error variances for five of the eight minimum269\nsoil indicators identified for England and Wales (Environment Agency, 2006), across270\ncontrasting regions of the United Kingdom, are about an order of magnitude larger than271\nthe combined analytical and subsampling variance, and an order of magnitude smaller272\n11\nthan the variance within the regions, parent materials and land uses. This shows that273\nthe largest reductions in estimation variance for means within these groups would be274\nobtained by increasing the number of sample sites, and the next largest reductions by275\nincreasing the number of cores that are aggregated at each sample site.276\nFurther work is needed on the effects of location error, and to investigate similar277\nsources of uncertainty in other soil indicators.278\nAcknowledgements279\nThe Tellus surveys were financed in Northern Ireland by the the Department of Enter-280\nprise, Trade and Investment and the \u2019Building Sustainable Prosperity\u2019 scheme of the281\nRural Development Programme.
