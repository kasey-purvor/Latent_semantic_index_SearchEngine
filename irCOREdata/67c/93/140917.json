This paper describes the development \nand initial validation of a reliable and valid multidimensional scale to assess these \nparameters based upon a technique previously developed to evaluate aircraft handling \nqualities.  The scaling methodology developed emphasizes the interaction between the \nvehicle\u2019s dynamic behaviour and the category of vehicle (e.g. sports car, executive \nsaloon).  This three-part study describes the initial extraction and the subsequent \nverification of the scale dimensions from an analysis of the opinions of circa 500 \ndrivers, followed by an evaluation of the sensitivity and diagnosticity of the scale to \ndistinguish between the road behaviour exhibited by vehicle types.  The results \nsuggest that the scale shows both content and construct validity, being able to \ndistinguish both between broad categories of vehicle and different models of vehicle \nwithin a particular category in a consistent and meaningful manner. \n \n \n 2\n1. Introduction \n \nModern technology has given the automotive engineer many more options from \nwhich to choose when optimizing the ride\/handling qualities compromise of the \nmodern motor vehicle.  With the advent of increased computerization in road cars and \nsuspension systems that are not dependent upon traditional steel springs (e.g. by using \nfast acting pneumatic or hydraulic systems) there will be even more ways available to \nrefine their behaviour.  To a limited extent, this is already happening in many \u2018top of \nthe range\u2019 executive and sports cars where drivers are given the option to select one of \na number of pre-defined damper settings reflecting their preference for a sporting or \ncomfort-oriented ride.  More advanced systems becoming available also allow the \ndriver an element of control over the vehicle\u2019s anti-roll bars, allowing them to decide \nupon the degree of roll exhibited by the car when cornering.  However, with the \nintroduction of computer-controlled hydro-pneumatic suspensions with no springs, \nthe effective spring rates; damping characteristics (both in bump and rebound); the \nroll characteristics of the vehicle (including roll centre); and anti-dive and anti-squat \ncharacteristics will all be able to be optimized through software changes.  \nFurthermore, with the introduction of \u2018steer-by-wire\u2019 systems (should changes in the \ndesign and build regulations allow them), other characteristics of the driver-vehicle \ninterface will also be capable of being altered via simple changes to software settings, \nfor example steering gain and steering feel.  The same will apply to other parameters, \nsuch as throttle response, which may be altered to make a car feel more sporting or \nmore refined.  In short, there is a potential revolution in the none-too distant future \nconcerning the manner in which the modern road car will ride and handle.  Many of \n 3\nthe current compromises imposed by current passively-controlled mechanical systems \nwill no longer apply.   \n \nWith such flexibility becoming available concerning the dynamic behaviour of future \nvehicles, considerably more refined tools will be required to describe and evaluate the \nbehaviour of these cars.  Ideally, these descriptions should also be couched in the \nterms used by the end purchasers to describe their perceptions of their vehicle in \neveryday use.  However, such a metric is not currently available.  At present, the \ndynamic qualities of road vehicles tend to be evaluated by highly skilled test drivers \nusing either very simple unidimensional handing qualities scales (e.g. that developed \nby the Society of Automotive Engineers 1985); by the qualitative comments of these \nexperienced test drivers, typically evaluating the \u2018on-the-limit\u2019 aspects of the \nvehicle\u2019s behaviour; or by the measurement of engineering parameters related to \nparameters such as ride and handling.  The unidimensional scales utilized have been \npragmatically developed to fulfil in-company requirements rather than having been \ndeveloped to produce psychometrically robust measures of ride and handling \nqualities.  Qualitative comments from experienced test drivers are essential in refining \na vehicle\u2019s behaviour.  However, the inability to derive and quantify trends when \nusing these scales as a result of their lack of diagnosticity, and inter-rater differences \nin opinion and assessment technique when using unidimensional scales ultimately \nlimits their utility (see Field 1995, Harris 2000).   \n \nA directly analogous situation was faced by the aerospace industry several years ago \nwith the advent of \u2018fly-by-wire\u2019 (FBW) flight control systems.  These FBW systems \nallowed the control engineer more and simpler ways by which to refine the handling \n 4\nqualities of aircraft compared to conventional technology mechanical flight control \nsystems.  The rating scale most commonly used at this time was the Cooper-Harper \naircraft handling qualities rating scale (Cooper and Harper 1969).  The Cooper-Harper \nscale was a simple, unidimensional scale ranging from 1 \u2018Excellent, highly desirable\u2019 \nto 10 \u2018major deficiencies: control will be lost\u2026\u2019.  A fundamental problem with the \nuse of this scale though, was that the complexity of the aircraft\u2019s behaviour was not \nreflected in the dimensions of the scale (Payne and Harris 2000).  In addition, the \nCooper-Harper scale did not describe the interaction between the aircraft\u2019s dynamic \nqualities and the nature of the task being undertaken.  What may be desirable qualities \nin one type of manoeuvre may not be so desirable in another type of manoeuvre (see \nHarris et al. 1999, Harris 2000, Harris et al. 2000).  Similar criticisms may also be \nmade of unidimensional scales to describe the handling qualities of motor vehicles.  \nWhat may be a desirable characteristic in one type of vehicle (e.g. a more softly \nsprung, compliant ride in an executive car) may not be so desirable in another \ncategory of vehicle (e.g. a sports car).  Unidimensional scales do not take into account \nthe interaction between vehicle type, its dynamic road behaviour characteristics and \nits intended market segment.   \n \nIt has also been noted in the aviation industry that when using simple physical \nmeasurements of an aircraft\u2019s behaviour to evaluate handling qualities a misleading \nimpression may be gained (Harper and Cooper 1986).  The engineer makes \njudgements about the aircraft\u2019s handling qualities from data derived from only a small \npart of the total pilot\/vehicle system; individual parameters are analysed largely in \nisolation.  Only the pilot can observe the complete, complex dynamic behaviour of the \naircraft.  Thus, these qualities cannot be defined simply by engineering descriptions of \n 5\nan aircraft\u2019s response to a pilot\u2019s control input.  The authors concluded that it is \nessential that any description or assessment of handling qualities must include the \npilot\u2019s perceptions of the behaviour of the aircraft.  The same applies of road vehicles.  \nThe aim of vehicle performance, ride and handling evaluations is to assess if the \ndynamic qualities of the vehicle are suitable for the purpose and the market intended. \nTo this end a vehicle is mostly evaluated by the subjective judgement of experienced \nresearchers (Sano 1982).  \n \nAs alluded to earlier, handling qualities are complex and multidimensional, yet this is \nnot reflected in the scales to assess them.  In the aviation domain, Payne and Harris \n(2000) identified five dimensions of aircraft handling that proved to be stable and \ncould be easily related to the dynamic behaviour of the aircraft.  These were \nsubsequently developed into a multidimensional scale to assess aircraft handling \nqualities (the Cranfield Aircraft Handling Qualities Rating Scale \u2013 CAHQRS).  This \nscale, building upon concepts found in the NASA \u2013 TLX (National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration - Task Load Index) workload scale (Hart and Staveland 1988) \nalso took into account the interaction between the aircraft\u2019s handling qualities and the \ntask (Harris et al. 1999, Harris 2000, Harris et al. 2000).  In unidimensional scales \n(such as the Cooper-Harper scale and the vehicle handling qualities scale proposed by \nSAE) any interaction of handling qualities and the task and\/or context are \nincorporated in the testing procedure rather than being a recorded, evaluated part of \nthe measurement instrument.  \n \nTrials using the CAHQRS showed it to have far greater test-re-test reliability than the \nCooper-Harper scale.  Overall, the test re-test correlation for the full scale CAHQRS \n 6\nwas 0.95; for individual sub-scales the test re-test reliabilities ranged from 0.54 to \n0.98 (Harris et al. 2000).  In contrast the test re-test reliability for the Cooper-Harper \nscale was in the region on 0.23 (Harris et al. 2000).  This finding was in concordance \nwith the earlier work of Wilson and Riley (1989) and Field (1995) who also observed \nthat the Cooper-Harper Scale exhibited poor inter-pilot reliability and that often the \nratings provided did not tally with the opinions expressed on the pilots\u2019 comment \ncards.  Furthermore, the CAHQRS also showed much greater diagnosticity.  The \ngreater reliability of the CAHQRS was attributed to the scale\u2019s format (and hence the \nmethod by which ratings were elicited).  By using a simple, unidimensional format, \nfirstly the Cooper-Harper scale implicitly requires the rater to form mentally a \ncomposite score based on all the individual aspects of the aircraft\u2019s handling.  The \nrater is then required to weight these components, relative to one another, with regard \nto the requirements of the task being flown, before finally settling on a handling \nqualities rating.  Many implicit judgements and comparisons are required prior to \nmaking the final rating, hence there is a great deal of scope for variability in several \naspects of the process that can contribute to the lack of reliability.  The CAHQRS \nmakes this process explicit.  Importance weightings for each of the components of \naircraft handling for a particular manoeuvre are made explicitly prior to performing \nthe task.  The pilot is then required to make evaluations of five well-defined aspects of \nthe aircraft\u2019s dynamic behaviour, irrespective of how important they are for the \nmanoeuvre undertaken.  Greater reliability is obtained as a result of making more than \na single rating and also through the manner by which the various aspects of an \naircraft\u2019s handling are combined to produce a rating, which is now through a \nmechanical and explicit process.  In contrast, when using the Cooper-Harper scale the \nmanner in which the various components of the way the aircraft\u2019s behaviour are \n 7\ncombined is via subjective judgement and weighting to produce the final single score \nwhich reflects a composite of several parameters.  \n \nStanton and Young (1999a, 1999b) have criticized the development of many \nergonomics measures and methods for being neither psychometrically robust nor \nreliable.  Indeed, for many often used scales in Ergonomics, there is little (or no) \nreliability or validity data quoted (for example, see the compendium of human \nperformance measures collated by Gawron 2000).  Certainly all unidimensional \nmeasures of handling qualities can be criticised, as there is no evidence that they \nposses either construct or content validity.  Using the guidelines from other areas in \npsychology, for example personality theory or intelligence testing, the psychometric \nproperties of many measurement scales used in ergonomics fall well below the \nacceptable norms for reliability, validity and measurement properties in general (for \nexample see Anastasi 1990 or Colle and Reid 1997). \n \nFor any scale of vehicle dynamic qualities to be useful (i.e. reliable, valid, diagnostic \nand sensitive to differences in appropriate vehicle parameters) there is a fundamental \nunderlying assumption that drivers are sensitive to such aspects.  This is, however, \nevidence that this is the case.  Brindle (1984, 1986), using a subjective rating scale, \ndemonstrated that drivers were sensitive to the differences between cross-ply and \nradial tyres.  Furthermore, in a series of \u2018on the road\u2019 studies he also showed that \ndrivers modified their driving behaviour in response to these tyre characteristics.  \nMore recently Walker, Stanton and Young (2001) made similar observations showing \nthat drivers were sensitive to the dynamic characteristics of different categories of \nvehicle.  \n 8\n \nThis paper describes the development and initial validation of a multidimensional \nscale to assess road vehicle dynamic qualities.  The method is based largely on the \nused to develop the CAHQRS.  The objectives were to produce an instrument that \ndescribed the manner in which everyday car drivers assessed the qualities of their \nvehicle (i.e. taking a user-centred\/customer-focussed approach).  As Ike Iaconelli, \nFord\u2019s director of Global Test Operations observed \u2018One of the biggest problems that \nall manufacturers face is trying to replicate what happens in the real world, with real \ndrivers.  Our test drivers, for example, are skilled drivers who know how to get the \nbest from a car and they cover more mileage than most.  This of course, does not \nmake them representative of the typical Ford customer\u2026\u2019  (Testing Technology \nInternational, 1998).  The scale was required to have good content validity (i.e. its \ncomponents must encompass all the pertinent aspects of the domain to be assessed); \ngood construct reliability (i.e. the underlying constructs should be stable across \nsamples); and it should have satisfactory indications of construct validity.  Campbell \n(1960) suggested that an insight into construct validity could be gained via an \nassessment of a scale\u2019s convergent and discriminant validity.  With regard to this \nlatter aspect the scale was required to be able to distinguish between vehicle types in a \nreliable and consistent manner. \n \n \n 9\n2. Overview of methodology \n \nThe method to develop the vehicle dynamics qualities rating scale progressed in three \ndistinct phases.  Phase One was concerned with eliciting the basic dimensions of \nvehicle ride, feel, performance and handling as described by a large sample of car \ndrivers.  Phase Two essentially replicated Phase One in a further independent sample \nto ensure that the descriptions previously elicited were stable (i.e. the dimensions had \nconstruct validity).  Phase Three transformed dimensions elicited into a rating scale to \nassess the dynamic qualities of road vehicles and evaluated the scale\u2019s sensitivity and \ndiscriminant validity (i.e. its ability to discriminate between categories and types of \nvehicle in a meaningful manner).  \n \n 10\n3. Phase one   \n \n3.1 Initial elicitation of dimensions \n \nApproximately 400 adjectives to describe the dynamic qualities of passenger cars \nwere collected from road tests published in the popular motoring press (e.g. Autocar).  \nFrom these adjectives, the 52 most frequently used were identified and then paired \nwith a word of diametrically opposite meaning to form a series of bi-polar adjective \npairs.  When constructing these bi-polar pairs it was always ensured that not only \nwere the words antonyms of each other but also that there was one desirable and one \nundesirable pole.  These bi-polar adjective pairs were then presented to 50 \nparticipants.  These were recruited on an ad hoc basis but to be eligible they had to be \nin possession of a full UK driving licence.  The participants were asked to evaluate \nthe meaningfulness of these bi-polar adjective pairs to describe the performance, feel, \nride and handling qualities of a motor vehicle.    \n \nInitial qualitative analysis indicated that respondents had some difficulty in separating \nhaptic feedback (such as steering \u2018feel\u2019) from the actual performance, handling and \nride qualities of their vehicle.  As it was desired to produce a customer-centred \ndescription of a vehicle\u2019s dynamic qualities and the aim was to produce a scale with \nhigh content validity it was decided to retain these items.  For any scale with \npsychometric properties to have content validity, the items in it must evaluate all \nmajor aspects of the domain to be assessed which requires a systematic assessment of \nthat domain at the outset of the scale\u2019s development (Anastasi 1990).   \n \n 11\nAfter the initial parsing of the adjectives to identify the most applicable descriptions \nof vehicle road behaviour, the remaining 33 pairs were made into a short self-\ncompletion questionnaire.  The order that the adjectival pairs were presented on the \ninstrument was randomized.  Each item used a 1-5, tick-box rating scale to indicate, in \nthe opinion of the person completing the questionnaire, which adjective pole they \nagreed with most and to what degree.  In approximately half of the cases the desirable \npole was presented first and vice versa.  Brief demographic details of the respondent \n(age, sex and number of years that they had held a full driving licence) and details of \ntheir motor vehicle(s) were also collected. \n  \nThese questionnaires were distributed to UK motorists personally by one of the \nresearchers in the car parks at a large UK sporting event.  They were given a pack \ncontaining a covering letter about the aims and objectives of the study; instructions \nfor completing the questionnaire and a FREEPOST envelope for its return. The \nrespondents were asked them to assess the ride and handling qualities of the vehicle \nthat they used most frequently.  In total 300 questionnaires were distributed.   \n \n3.2 Analysis of responses \n \nTwo hundred and twenty-three completed survey instruments were returned, \nrepresenting a 78% response rate.  Of these 181 (81.2%) were from male drivers and \n42 (18.8%) from females.  The age range of respondents was from 17 to 65 years \n(with a mean of 35.8 and standard deviation of 10.8 years) and the mean number of \nyears of driving experience was 17.3 with a standard deviation of 10.5.  Five distinct \ncategories of vehicle were represented in the sample as a whole, including 25.0% \n 12\nsmall cars (<4.00m); 44.4% medium cars (4.01 \u2013 5.00m); 22.2% large, executive cars \n(>5.01m); 2.8% off-road (four-wheel drive) vehicles, and the remaining 5.6% were \nclassified as either sporting coupes or roadsters. \n \nPrior to analysis the data were transformed (as appropriate) so that in all cases a high \nscore represented a desirable dynamic quality of the vehicle.  The data were then \nsubject to principal components analysis (PCA) using SPSS (version 9.00).  From the \nPCA seven components were extracted accounting for 65% of the total variance in the \nsample.  Kaiser\u2019s criterion (components with an Eigenvalue in excess of unity) was \nused to determine the maximum number of components extracted.  These components \nwere subject to a Varimax rotation to produce a \u2018cleaner\u2019, more interpretable solution.  \nFor an item to be deemed to load onto one of the extracted components it was \nrequired to have a loading in excess of 0.45 (significant p<0.01 \u2013 see Hair et al. \n1998).  Items loading onto two (or more) components were excluded from the final \nsolution.  \n \nThe final, post rotation principal components solution is described in table 1 along \nwith its associated summary statistics in table 2.  As can be seen, the principal \ncomponents extracted largely distinct and recognizable descriptions of the ride, \nhandling and steering qualities of motor vehicles.   \n \nINSERT TABLES 1 AND 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe components extracted were then subject to an examination of their internal \nconsistency (reliability).  Component 1 (\u2018Steering Qualities\u2019) had a Cronbach\u2019s alpha \n 13\nof 0.91.  Component 2 (\u2018Performance\u2019) initially also had an alpha value of 0.91, \nhowever two items (\u2018Rapid\/Slow\u2019 and \u2018Exciting\/Dull\u2019) actually were detrimental to \nthe overall internal consistency of this component.  Once these were removed, the \nalpha value was elevated to 0.95.  Removal of these items also resulted in a more \ncoherent and parsimonious dimension, in terms of its constituent components.  \nAnalysis of the internal consistency of \u2018Ride Composure\u2019 (component 3) resulted in a \nCronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.80 and component 4 (\u2018Handling Qualities\u2019) had a \ncorresponding value of 0.78.  The final two dimensions (component 5 \u2018Ride Comfort\u2019 \nand component 6 \u2018Grip\u2019) had Cronbach\u2019s alpha values of 0.77 and 0.83, respectively.  \nAll the values for Cronbach\u2019s produced were well over the minimum acceptable level \nof 0.7 for scale internal reliability as suggested by Cronbach (1951) and Robinson et \nal. (1991).  As final component extracted in the initial analysis was composed of only \na single item, this dimension was not used in the following verification stage, as \nsingle item components are inherently unreliable. \n \n \n 14\n4. Phase two  \n \n4.1 Verification of dimensions  \n \nThe objective of the second phase was to cross-validate the latent structure underlying \nvehicle dynamic qualities elicited in the PCA in Phase One in an independent sample \nto assess its stability, reliability (internal consistency) and construct validity.  Only if \nthese factors were satisfactory would the items elicited in Phase One be suitable for \nforming the basis of a psychometrically robust, multidimensional vehicle dynamic \nqualities rating scale. \n \nAll the items describing each of the six dimensions that remained after the analysis of \nthe components internal consistency (see table 1) were formed into a second \nquestionnaire using an identical response format to that described previously.  The \nsame demographic and vehicle data as before were also collected.   \n \nThis second, self-completion questionnaire was distributed to 1,000 drivers, however \nin this case the categories of vehicle identified in the previous results section were \nspecifically targeted to ensure that the cross validation sample was of a similar \ncomposition to the previous sample.  Questionnaires were distributed to drivers in \npublic car parks to aid in this respect.   \n \nAs before, completed survey instruments were returned to the researchers using the \nFREEPOST envelope included in the questionnaire distribution pack.  \n \n 15\n4.2 Analysis of responses \n \nOf the 1,000 questionnaires distributed, 224 (22.4%) questionnaires were returned in \ntime for analysis, comprised of 146 (65.2%) from male drivers and 78 (34.8%) from \nfemale drivers.  The age range of respondents was from 18 to 68 years (with a mean \nof 41.7 years).  The final sample of vehicles was composed of 22.3% small cars; \n37.5% medium cars; 27.7% large cars and 12.5% sporting coupes and roadsters. \n \nPrior to analysis, the data were treated in exactly the same manner as that described at \nthe beginning of the previous results section.  The data were then subject to a \nconfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using AMOS 4.1.  A maximum likelihood method \nwas selected for factor extraction.  The hypothesized factor structure against which \nthe data in Phase Two were compared was that derived in the PCA in Phase One.   \n \nAn initial CFA was only a moderately good fit to the hypothesized structure of road \nvehicle dynamic qualities elicited in Phase One (\u03c72 minimum = 753.68; df = 362; \np<0.001: adjusted \u03c72 = 2.08: GFI \u2013 \u2018goodness of fit index\u2019 = 0.81: AGFI \u2013\u2018adjusted \ngoodness of fit index = 0.77).  However, the deletion of several items (listed in table \n3) on the basis of the computed modification indices (the likely reduction in the \noverall \u03c72 goodness-of-fit value) produced a slightly modified model of indicator \nvariables loading onto latent factors which produced a model with an extremely good \nfit to the hypothesized latent structure of vehicle behaviour (\u03c72 minimum = 150.97; \ndf=120; p<0.03: adjusted \u03c72 = 1.26: GFI \u2013 \u2018goodness of fit index\u2019 = 0.93: AGFI \u2013\n\u2018adjusted goodness of fit index = 0.90). All these values are well in excess of those \nsuggested by Hair et al. (1998) as being indicative of an acceptable CFA solution.  It \n 16\nis likely that in the initial extraction of components (described in Phase One and in \ntables 1 and 2) certain variables loading onto a component were included as a result of \ncapitalizing on chance associations within the data set rather than as a result of \nreflecting the true underlying dimensions of vehicle dynamic qualities.   As a result, \nthese variables are highly likely to be eliminated in the cross-validation phase.  It is \nalso noticeable that the majority of variables deleted were from the larger components \nin the initial PCA.  This may suggest that these components were what Cronbach \n(1951) has termed a \u2018bloated specific\u2019 (i.e. a highly specific description of a very \nnarrow underlying construct).  This was not reflected in the second administration of \nthe scale which used a slightly smaller sub-set of items (see discussion in section 3.2 \u2013 \nAnalysis of responses).  The final model also served to increase the parsimony of the \nsolution and enhance the interpretability of the factors produced.  The final factor \nstructure from the CFA is described in figure 1 and the inter-correlations between the \nlatent variables are contained in table 4.   \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 AND FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nAs it was proposed to use the items from each of the latent variables in the CFA to \nform the basis of a scale for constructing a multidimensional vehicle dynamic \nqualities rating scale, the internal consistency of these factors was again assessed to \nensure that the items were all good indicators of the same underlying construct.  The \nresults of this analysis using Cronbachs\u2019 Alpha can be found in table 5.  Once again it \ncan be seen that all the values for Cronbach\u2019s Alpha were well over the minimum \nacceptable level suggested by Cronbach (1951) and Robinson et al. (1991) of 0.70 for \ninternal consistency. \n 17\n \nINSERT TABLES 4 AND 5 ABOUT HERE \n \n4.3 Discussion of results   \n \nThe results from the CFA performed on the data from the independent, cross-\nvalidation sample suggest that the dimensions of vehicle dynamic qualities elicited are \nstable, replicable and thus have construct validity.  The manner by which the items \nwere originally selected for inclusion in the study in Phase One should also ensure \ntheir content validity.   The Cronbachs\u2019 Alpha statistics computed for each dimension \nwould also suggest that the dimensions are internally consistent (reliable).   \n \nAlthough the cross-validation of dimensions in the CFA has resulted in some high \ninter-correlations amongst the factors, this is to be expected as structural equation \nmodelling makes no attempt to produce orthogonal factors (cf. the Varimax rotation \nused in Phase One).  Inspection of the inter-correlations between the dimensions, \nhowever, does suggest that drivers can distinguish between various aspects of their \nvehicles dynamic behaviour and make separate evaluations of them.  For example, the \nmajority of the correlations involving the dimensions of Ride Comfort and \nPerformance are all relatively small (see table 4).  However, the correlations between \nSteering Qualities and both Grip and Handling Qualities are high, suggesting that \ndrivers regard these dimensions as being highly inter-related in everyday driving.    \n \nOn the basis of these results a multidimensional road vehicle dynamic qualities rating \nscale was constructed using similar concepts to those found in the NASA-TLX mental \n 18\nworkload scale (Hart and Staveland 1988) and the CAHQRS multidimensional \naircraft handling qualities rating scale (Harris et al. 2000).      \n \n 19\n5. Phase three \n \n5.1 Scale construction and data collection \n \nThere were two basic components to the construction of the rating scale, the scale \nevaluating each component of vehicle dynamic behaviour for its adequacy and a \nfurther component that rated the importance of each of these aspects with respect to \nthe role\/category of the vehicle (q.v. the weighting index of the NASA-TLX or the \ncriticality index of the CAHQRS).   \n \nThe rating aspect of the scale was constructed simply from a mean of the ratings on \nall the components making up each sub-scale (as derived from the final CFA) once \nthe items had been transformed to ensure that a high rating represented a desirable \nride or handling quality (exactly as the data were treated in Phases One and Two).  \nThe ratings aspect of the scale was presented in the exactly same manner as \npreviously described.  \n \nAfter completing the rating scales respondents were also required to rank the \nimportance of each dimension of the vehicle\u2019s dynamic qualities with respect to the \ncategory of the vehicle being rated.  The importance scale was comprised of a ranking \nfrom one (most important) to six (least important).  Short definitions of the vehicle \ndynamic qualities dimensions can be found in table 6. \n \nINSERT TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE \n \n 20\nTo test the sensitivity and predictive validity of the scale it was administered to \ndrivers of 49 \u2018superminis\u2019 (e.g. Ford Fiesta and Peugot 206); 48 small hatchbacks \n(e.g. Ford Focus and Volkswagen Golf); 33 medium-sized cars (e.g. Ford Mondeo \nand Vauxhall\/Opel Vectra); 61 small executive cars (e.g. Audi A4 and Mercedes-\nBenz C-Class) and 22 small, sporting coupes (e.g. Ford Puma and Renault Megan\u00e9 \nCoupe).  To target the drivers of the specific vehicle types required for the study, \ndrivers were approached directly in the car parks of a major UK shopping centre as \nthey were returning to their vehicles.  Within each of these sub-samples it was \nensured that there was a reasonably large sample of al least two models, including the \nclass-leading vehicle (as defined in Autocar magazine) at the time of the study.   \n \n5.2 Treatment of data and scale scoring  \n \nFor the sake of consistency and to aid interpretation, the scale score data were \nreversed so that a low score represented a desirable dynamic characteristic (i.e. scores \nwere presented in the same fashion a the Cooper-Harper scale and other scales using \nthis format, such as the Bedford Scale by Roscoe 1984 and the Haworth-Newman \nDisplay Readability Scale, see Newman and Greeley 2001).  The ranking data \nreflecting the importance of each of the dimensions for a particular category of \nvehicle was left unchanged.  \n \nSub-scale scores reflecting a vehicle\u2019s dynamic qualities were calculated from the \nproduct of the mean scale value.  For use in a diagnostic context, these scale scores \nwere then multiplied by their associated importance ranking.  Both the NASA-TLX \nworkload scale and the CAHQRS use this approach.  By taking this approach the \n 21\nsensitivity of the scale is enhanced (compared to a unidimensional scale) by \u2018gearing\u2019 \nthe scale ratings by their relative importance to the category of vehicle.  When making \ncomparisons of vehicles within a category, though, this is not necessary, as described \nin the following section.   \n \n5.3 Results of validation exercise \n \n5.3.1 Ranking of importance of the dimensions of vehicle dynamic qualities by \ncategory of vehicle    \n \nOne of the basic premises of the scale under development is that different aspects of a \nvehicle\u2019s dynamic qualities will be of differing levels of importance with respect to \nthe vehicles category (e.g. sports car or executive car).   \n \nThe rankings of the importance of each aspect of a vehicle\u2019s dynamic behaviour \nsuggest that the relative importance of each aspect is different with respect to the \ncategory of the vehicle.  For all categories of vehicle, with the exception of medium \nsized saloon cars, a within vehicle category analysis of the ranks awarded (Friedman\u2019s \nanalysis of ranks) shows significant differences with respect to the category of \ndynamic behaviour assessed (supermini; \u03c72=24.64, df=5, p<0.001: small hatchback; \n\u03c72=46.87, df=5, p<0.001: medium-sized car; \u03c72=1.57, df=5, p>0.05: small executive \ncar; \u03c72=22.97, df=5, p<0.001: and small coupes; \u03c72=13.53, df=5, p<0.02). \n \nA brief analysis of the rankings in table 7 suggests that (not surprisingly) drivers of \nsmall, sporting coupes regarded handling, steering and grip as being more important \n 22\nthan ride quality.  Conversely, drivers of executive cars emphasised ride composure \nand comfort over performance and handling qualities.  The pattern of results from \ndrivers of the smaller two categories of vehicle showed a far less clear pattern of \nrankings, although in both cases performance was placed at a premium.  The pattern \nof rankings for medium sized vehicles should be interpreted with caution, as there was \nvery little difference in the mean ranks of the categories, suggesting no clear \npreference (overall) in the dynamic qualities of these vehicles.  This may reflect the \nmulti-purpose character of these cars.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE \n \n5.3.2 Sub-scale validity and sensitivity    \n \nFor the individual sub-scales to be valid they must be able to discriminate \nmeaningfully between vehicles.  To be useful, the scales must also be sensitive.  \nScales that discriminate only between the dynamic qualities of very disparate \ncategories of vehicle (for example off-road vehicles and sports cars) are of very \nlimited utility.   \n \nTo test the sensitivity of the sub-scales, the ratings of dynamic behaviour of one or \nmore models within each category was compared to the class-leading vehicle.  For the \nsake of brevity only two such analyses are reported and discussed here.  As the \nobjective in this case was to test the sensitivity of the sub-scales within a group, sub-\nscale scores were not multiplied by the corresponding importance ranking.  These \n 23\nlatter aspects reflect the importance of that component of dynamic behaviour within a \nclass of vehicle, not between types of vehicle.   \n \nWhile it is moderately straightforward to demonstrate the sensitivity of the scales in \nthis manner, it is far more difficult to demonstrate their criterion validity as there is no \nreadily measurable parameter to compare the scale results against.  As a result, in an \nattempt to demonstrate criterion validity, the results were compared to comments \ntaken from widely-published vehicle road tests.  \n \nIn a comparison of small hatchbacks, the class-leading vehicle (car A) was compared \nagainst the best selling similar vehicle in Europe (car B).  These results are shown in \ntable 8.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe results in table 8 show that the class leading vehicle was superior to its \ncomparison vehicle in all respects, significantly so in terms of the performance and \nhandling qualities dimensions of dynamic behaviour.  The results for the steering \nqualities and ride composure dimensions are also verging on significance.  This would \nsuggest that these sub-scales are sensitive enough to differentiate between these two \nvehicles.  However, the scales must differentiate between the cars in a meaningful \nway if they are to be valid.  Of car A, What Car? magazine stated:- \n \n 24\n\u2018\u2026it\u2019s still hard to take in just how far ahead of the game What Car?\u2019s small \nhatchback of the year has taken the driving pleasure you can expect from this \nclass of car.\u2019 \n \n\u2018You notice straight away how stable and composed [car A] feels and how \nevery steering wheel movement produces an accurate response from the front \nwheels\u2019. \n \n\u2018Cornering is crisp and accurate\u2026 it rides badly pock-marked B-roads firmly \nand it\u2019s never harsh and refinement is terrific.\u2019  (What Car? online reviews, \n2001).     \n \nWhile it should be noted that these comments are taken from a motoring magazine, \nthey do suggest that the ratings on the sub-scale dimensions of steering qualities, ride \ncomposure and handling qualities appropriately reflect the dynamic behaviour of the \nvehicle in question.  There is further evidence in this respect when the corresponding \nreviews of car B are considered.  \n \n\u2018The [car B] has had some of its thunder stolen by [car A] in the past year\u2019 \n \n\u2018We have no complaints about the [car B\u2019s] overall competence but it won\u2019t \ndelight a driver in the same way as the [car A] which stamps its authority over \n[car B] on the road\u2019 \n \n 25\n\u2018The [car B] has a little too much body roll and a lack of steering feel through \nbends \u2026  It can\u2019t boast a composed ride either.\u2019 \n \n\u2018\u2026 copes with undulations and crests well but feels fidgety over potholes.\u2019 \n(What Car? online reviews, 2001).     \nThese further comments would indicate that in terms of the relative sub-scale scores \nawarded by respondents, the scales are sensitive enough to differentiate between the \ntwo vehicles in terms of their dynamic responses and also do so in a meaningful, valid \nmanner.  \n \nIn a comparison of medium sized cars, the class-leading vehicle (car C) was compared \nagainst the its leading competitor in the UK fleet and medium-sized car market (car \nD).  These results can be seen in table 9. \n \nINSERT TABLE 9 ABOUT HERE \n \nTable 9 shows that car C was rated as being superior in the areas of performance, \nsteering qualities grip and there was also a strong suggestion that it was also better \nthan car D in terms of its ride composure.  Road test comments about car C support \nthe results in table 9.   \n \n\u2018Wonderfully crisp steering feel with a strong, self-centring action.\u2019  Autocar \n(1996).  \n \n 26\n\u2018The [car C] has been a keen handler from day one and the facelift a couple of \nyears ago only served to sharpen its responses.  This ability to supply driver \nenjoyment on demand may be at the expense of ultimate ride comfort, but you \nhave to drive over some very rutted road to pick up on this.\u2019 (What Car? \nonline reviews, 2001).     \n \nReviews of car D supported the results of the sub-scale comparisons with car C, \nproviding further for the validity of the sub-scales.  For example: \n \n\u2018Comfort over distance is the [Car D\u2019s] strength, not B-road entertainment. \nHowever, it\u2019s relatively pleasing to punt along, thanks to smooth engines and \na comfortable ride.  But the [car D] is not as entertaining as a [car C or list of \nother competitors].  (Autotrader online road test reviews, 2002) \n \n\u2018Happiest and most refined on motorway; less so on twisty roads where \nhandling and ride lack poise and polish\u2026\u2019  (Parker\u2019s online car reviews, \n2002) \n \n\u2018Not a car to drive for the pleasure of it\u2026\u2019  (Parker\u2019s online car reviews, \n2002) \n \nOne of the more interesting points to note is that the ratings were collected from \nmember\u2019s of the general public about their current cars.  In many cases (although it is \nimpossible to determine how many) this is likely to be a judgement of the dynamic \nqualities of their vehicle in isolation, whereas many of the comments made by the \n 27\nmotoring press are comparative comments from road testers who have had the benefit \nof driving all the cars compared in the previous two analyses.  However, despite the \nrespondents probably not having the benefit of comparison, the scales still \ndiscriminate between the models in the manner expected, again suggesting further \nevidence of validity.  \n \n5.3.3 Multidimensional presentation of scale results \n \nIn the present application, low scores and low rankings are more desirable or more \nimportant.  As was also the case with the NASA-TLX and the CAHQRS, it was also \npossible to compute an overall scale score for the ride\/handling qualities of the \nvehicle through the weighted summation of the individual sub-scale scores, although \nit is argued that this is of limited utility as the power of the scale resides in the \ninterpretation of its component sub-scales.   \n \nPerhaps the greatest power of multidimensional scales lies in the graphical \npresentation of scores.  When presenting data in this manner, in accordance with the \npractice employed by both the NASA-TLX and the CAHQRS, scale ratings of vehicle \ndynamic qualities were plotted (individually) on the y-axis and the importance \nrankings on the x-axis.  Short histogram bars are desirable, and narrow bars indicate \nhigher levels of importance.  This approach was chosen as it emphasizes the \ninteraction between the compromises made between the various dynamic qualities and \nthe category of the vehicle.  An example of this method of depicting the results is \ngiven in figure 2, where a poorly rated sports coupe (car X) is contrasted with a highly \nrated executive saloon (car Y).  It can be seen from the width of the bars in the \n 28\ngraphical representation that the dimensions of ride comfort and ride composure are \nregarded as being the most important be drivers of executive saloons, whereas drivers \nof sporting coupes place greater emphasis on grip, steering and handling qualities.  \nThe drivers of the class-leading car Y rated all aspects of their vehicle\u2019s dynamic \nproperties superior to those of the old, poorly regarded small, sporting coupe, as \nindicated by the shorter histogram bars.  Comments from the road tests concerning the \ndynamic behaviour of car X include: \n \n\u2018\u2026it lacks the sophistication to really be pushed on. The steering is a bit too \nlight at speed, and the roadholding's not secure enough under pressure.  It's \nperfectly adequate for most, undemanding, drivers, but serious sports fans will \nbe frustrated and disappointed.\u2019  (Autotrader online road test reviews, 2002) \n \n\u2018Besides being cramped, the [car X] also serves a bumpy, noisy ride.\u2019  \n(Autotrader online road test reviews, 2002) \n \nINSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nThese comments would seem to endorse the ratings awarded by its drivers.  In \ncontrast, the comments for car Y tend to be more complimentary, yet also reflect its \ndifferent role and the ratings awarded by its drivers: \n \n\u2018\u2026 good ride and remarkable smoothness at cruising speeds.\u2019 (What Car? \nonline reviews, 2001).     \n \n 29\n\u2018High marks here - the [car Y] is a very relaxed and secure motorway cruiser, \nand has better ride quality than most in the class.\u2019  (Autotrader online road \ntest reviews, 2002) \n \n\u2018Performance - Not a strong point\u2026\u2019  (Autotrader online road test reviews, \n2002) \n \n \n 30\n6. Discussion \n \nThe scale developed to assess motor vehicle dynamic qualities was based upon \nscaling principles initially used in the NASA-TLX multidimensional workload scale \n(Hart and Staveland 1988) and the Cooper-Harper aircraft handling qualities scale \n(Cooper and Harper 1969), which where subsequently developed in the CAHQRS \n(see Harris et al. 2000).  Using the same approach as in the later case, a scale has been \ndeveloped which allows everyday drivers to assess meaningfully the dynamic \nbehaviour of their vehicles.  The aims were to produce a scale that had good content \nvalidity; good construct reliability and which was sensitive to differences between the \ndynamic behaviour of different vehicles.  Through the manner in which the scale was \ninitially developed the content validity should be assured.  The replicability of the \nunderlying factor structure (figure 1) is also indicative of good construct validity (see \nAnastasi 1990). \n \nThe establishment of criterion reliability for abstract concepts such as the assessment \nof the dynamic qualities of a motor vehicle is much harder to establish (q.v. the \nhandling qualities of an aircraft \u2013 see Harris et al. 2000).  The broad agreement of the \nscale ratings with the opinions of professional motor-magazine road testers does \nsuggest that the scale aids in producing valid ratings of the dynamic behaviour of \nmotor vehicles (see tables 8 and 9 and figure 2).  \n \nThe use of a NASA-TLX type of scale format once again shows the importance of \nbeing able to rate and display the interactive nature of scale ratings with context.  \nPreviously, in the case of the CAHQRS, this interaction was between aircraft handling \n 31\nqualities and the nature of the manoeuvre being flown.  In the present case the \ninteraction is between the category of motor vehicle and its dynamic behaviour.  The \ndifferences in the rankings of importance of the various aspects of a vehicle\u2019s \ndynamic behaviour indicate that the drivers of the five different categories of vehicle \nincluded in this study did not all want the same things of their vehicles (see table 7).  \nThis underlines the importance of taking the assessment approach suggested herein.  \nSimple ratings of dynamic qualities on each of the sub-scales are not enough.  To \ndraw conclusions simply from these assessments would overlook the complex \ninteraction with the category of the vehicle and hence the relative importance of each \naspect of its behaviour.  \n \nIt is again interesting to note that the everyday driver is sensitive to differences in the \ndynamic behaviour of road vehicles, which supports the earlier observations of \nBrindle (1984, 1986) and Walker et al. (2001).  It is not just test drivers that are \nsensitive to these aspects, which further strengthens the call to involve everyday \ndrivers in the development of motor vehicles on-the-road dynamic qualities.  There is \nmuch more scope for a user-centred approach in this area than may be initially \nthought. \n \nFurther development of the scale is planned in a series of trials in an engineering \nsimulator and in a set of test-track trials.  These trials will further evaluate the \ncriterion validity of the scale and also assess its test-re-test reliability and sensitivity.  \nHowever, the initial results would seem to suggest that there is a sound basis on which \nto continue further scale development and assessment, thereby avoiding the criticism \n 32\nof other measures in ergonomics that they do not conform to even the most basic \nstandards for psychometric measurement. \n \n \n 33\n7.
