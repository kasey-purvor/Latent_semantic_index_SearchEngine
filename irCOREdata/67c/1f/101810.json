Phys. Lett. 78, (2001) 2339\nThe possible use of amorphous carbon (a-C) and hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) based \nmaterials as cold cathodes has now been well documented. [1, 2] To date there have been \nnumerous reports of field emission (FE) at low macroscopic electric fields from a range of a-C \nand a-C:H based materials. [1, 2, 3, 4] In the case of emission from diamond-like carbon (DLC) \nfilms it has been reported that, the main barrier which controls emission may lie at the front \nfilm\/vacuum interface. [3]  By contrast, for low defect density polymeric-like carbon (PAC) a-\nC:H films the presence of a heterojunction at the a-C:H\/Si rear contact, resulting in hot electron \ntransport through the film has been proposed. [4] This model was used to explain the observed \nstrong dependence of the threshold field (Eth) with film thickness. [5] Although the different \ntypes of film possess different physical properties and emission from them has been explained by \ndifferent mechanisms, it has been observed that emission is often highly non-uniform across the \nfilm surface. [3, 4, 6] One of the major problems hindering the development thin film carbon \ncathodes is the lack of understanding of a definitive mechanism for emission at low applied \nfields, typically <20 V\/\u00b5m. [3-7] \nEmission from flat metal surfaces often requires fields in excess of 500 V\/\u00b5m [2], \nwhereas previous atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies of a-C and a-C:H films have indicated \nthat the films possess rms roughnesses of less than 1 nm [1\u20134], along with no evidence of surface \nprotrusions which can act as a source of geometric field enhancement. Two recent studies by Ilie \net al. [8] and Carey et al. [9] have proposed that it is the sp2 C cluster size and concentration that \nplay an important role in the FE process. In the study by Ilie, an optimum cluster size for \nemission of 1.5-2 nm was proposed. Carey showed that for a-C:H films deposited at different \nself biases, the FE could be explained in terms of the connectivity between sp2 clusters. In this \nletter, we first examine whether there is any dependence of Eth with thickness for DLC films and \ncompare these results to the behaviour reported [5] for PAC films. Scanning tunnelling \nmicroscope (STM) images of the DLC films, show that while the films may be atomically \nsmooth they do exhibit variations in their conductivity, which are attributed to dielectric \n 2\nAppl. Phys. Lett. 78, (2001) 2339\ninhomogeneities within the film. Due to the shape of the field lines emanating from these \ninhomogeneities, we propose that they give rise to an enhancement of the electric field which \nplays an important role in the FE properties of these films.  \nA-C:H films were deposited on the driven electrode of a Plasma Technology DP800 \ncapacitively coupled radio frequency (13.56 MHz) plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition \nsystem using n-type (1-2 \u2126 cm) (100) Si as a substrate material. During deposition feed gases of \nmethane (30 sccm) with He (75 sccm) were used. The total deposition pressure was 200 mTorr \nand the self bias on the driven electrode was altered by changing the rf power. Film thicknesses \nwere measured using ellipsometry. The FE characteristics of these films were examined using a \nsphere-to-plane geometry in which a 5 mm stainless-steel ball bearing is suspended 40 \u00b5m above \nthe surface at a high positive potential in a vacuum better than 4 x 10-6 mbar. The high voltage is \nstepped up and down four times.  Although a spherical anode is used the electric field between \nthe anode and the surface of the film can be modelled as a parallel plate. Using a sphere-to-plane \nelectrode arrangement, local areas under the anode are tested rather than sampling all sites on the \ncathode surface as in a planar diode arrangement. Each film is tested in a number of different \npositions to act as a measure of the reproducibility of the emission. In some of the samples a high \ninitial electric field is sometimes required before the onset of stable emission. This is evidence of \n\u2018conditioning\u2019 of the film and in some cases is accompanied by surface changes.  The threshold \nfield is defined as the macroscopic electric field which gives an emission current of 1 nA. STM \nmeasurements were made in ambient conditions using a Digital Instrument Nanoscope IIIa \nemploying a high resolution A scanner and using a sharpened Pt-Ir tip.  \nIn order to investigate the possible FE mechanisms present in these films, a series of \nfilms of different thickness were grown at self biases of \u201390 and \u2013265 V.  This complements the \nwork presented in an earlier paper for a series of low bias (approximately \u201310 V) PAC films. [5] \nThe variation of Eth as a function of thickness for the two DLC films, along with the data \nreported previously for the PAC films [5], is presented in Fig. 1. It is apparent that over the range \n 3\nAppl. Phys. Lett. 78, (2001) 2339\nof thicknesses examined no discernible trend of Eth with thickness is observed for the films \ndeposited at the higher biases. The average value of Eth for the films deposited at \u201390V bias is 20 \nV\/\u00b5m and 12 V\/\u00b5m for the films deposited at \u2013265 V bias.  The explanation of observed \nthickness dependence of Eth for the PAC films was based on the electrons at the back film\/Si \nhetrojunction experiencing the applied field from the front surface and being accelerated towards \nit by the large internal field at the back contact. [4, 5] Such an explanation is plausible when it is \nnoted that the defect density in these films is low, being approximately 3 x 1017 cm-3. [9]  These \ndefects have been associated with the more conductive sp2 clusters within the film. Field lines \nfrom the positively charged anode will terminate on these defects and result in localised \nscreening of the field at the defect. However, the density of defects in the PAC films is too low \nfor any global screening of the field to occur. In the case of the DLC films the defect density is 4 \nx 1018 cm-3 (\u201390 V) and  1.8 x 1020 cm-3 (\u2013265 V). [9]  In the films with the higher defect \ndensities, particularly in the film deposited at \u2013265 V, a sufficiently large surface charge density \nis present, arising from the areal defect density of  ~1015 cm-2, to effectively screen the applied \nfield to with in a short surface layer. The film deposited at \u201390 V bias is intermediate between \nthe PAC films and film deposited at \u2013265 V bias.  \nSince the defects are believed to be located near to the Fermi level of the film [9] the \nemission mechanism can be viewed as being Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunnelling into the vacuum. \nIn this way the FE is determined by the properties of the film near to the front surface. The AFM \nimages of these samples, not presented here, show that they possess an rms roughnesses of less \nthan 0.6 nm. If a FN emission process is present then it is necessary to explain the large \nenhancement factors, typically several hundred, required to lower a barrier by 4 eV. [5, 7, 10] In \norder to explain the origin of these large values of \u03b2, high resolution STM images of the DLC \nfilm grown at \u2013265 V have been performed and presented in Fig. 2. It is evident from the STM \nimages that the conductivity of the film is not uniform. There are a number of localised high \nconductivity regions of 1-2 nm in dimension surrounded by a more insulating matrix. The STM \n 4\nAppl. Phys. Lett. 78, (2001) 2339\nresults can be interpreted as resulting from a series of closely spaced localised conductive sp2 \nregions, which under the action of the applied field electrons may hop from one spatially \nlocalised cluster to another. [9]  In the continuous limit this will produce a conducting channel or \nfilament which can extend through the bulk of the film. Field enhancement due to a free standing \n\u2018protrusion\u2019 of length h and radius r can be approximated as h\/r. [11] If r is taken to be in the \nrange of 1-2 nm, obtained from the STM measurements, then for a \u03b2 value in the range of 100-\n300, say, h must be at least 100-600 nm. Such a large well defined feature having a continuous \npathway has never been observed using high resolution electron microscopy (HREM) (in either \nplan or cross section view). To date only well ordered microstructural region of about 1 nm has \nbeen observed using HREM. [12] This leads us to conclude that an alternative source of \nenhancement must be present.      \nWe propose the enhancement is due to the different dielectric and conductive properties \nof the sp2 clusters when compared with surrounding sp3 insulating matrix. Field enhancement \nnear a single conductive dielectric sphere in a insulating matrix, is well known [13] and \noriginates from the dielectric mismatch between the two materials and typically can give small \nenhancements of 1-2. Chaumet and Dufour [14] have considered the effects of the presence of \ntwo closely spaced dielectric spheres at an arbitrary orientation relative to the orientation of the \napplied field. Their calculations show that if two such conductive spheres, with the conductivity \nof gold, are placed 5 nm apart enhancements of 56 can be obtained which increases to an to over \n400 for a 1 nm. Although the conductivity of the sp2 clusters will not be as high as Au, this \nclassical electrostatic calculation shows that higher enhancement factors can be obtained by \nconsidering the effects of more than one conducting spheres near the surface. Relating this to \nnanoscale sized sp2 clusters, the emission process for DLC films can be explained as follows: the \nhigh density of defects will act as to localise and attract the field lines from the anode. In a thin \nregion near the surface of the film the inherent inhomogeneous nature present will result in \ndifferent regions (sp3 or sp2) experiencing different local fields. Additional field enhancement \n 5\nAppl. Phys. Lett. 78, (2001) 2339\nwill occur if two (or more) sp2 conductive clusters are nearby. Once the electrons are emitted \nfrom the clusters they may be replaced, via a hopping transport mechanism, by electrons from \nclusters deeper within the film. Such a description also helps explain the origin of the localised \nemission across the surface of the film which is dependant upon the local arrangement of the \nclusters near the surface.  \nBy using these results it is possible to present a unified description of the emission \nprocess from a-C:H based materials, as shown in Fig. 3, where the defect density versus optical \nTauc gap is presented. The spin density may be used as an indicator of the extent of field \npenetration and the connectivity of the sp2 clusters. [9] The use of the connectivity within closely \nspaced clusters on a three dimensional scale has recently exploited by Khan et al. which resulted \nin delocalized carriers transport in ion implanted a-C:H films. [15] The Tauc gap is a measure of \nthe type of material and size of the clusters. [3]  The low defect density PAC films possess a \nwide optical gap in which a high degree of field penetration occurs and the emission process is \none that is largely controlled by the hetrojunction at the back a-C:H\/Si interface.  The emission \nfrom high defect density DLC films is controlled by the front surface and internal enhancement \ndue to closely spaced clusters and the ability of electrons to hop from one cluster to the next. \nThis also applied to other high defect density materials such as undoped tetrahedral amorphous \ncarbon (ta-C) films.  It is interesting to note that in the studies by Zhao et al. [16] and Ilie et al.  \n[17] that no dependence of the threshold field with film thickness was observed, consistent with \nmodel proposed here.   \nThe FE properties of CNTs and carbon nanocomposite (CNC) films may also be \nexplained within the confines of Fig. 3. CNTs have been located towards the low optical gap, \nlow spin density region since these materials can be considered a rolled up graphite sheets with a \nsmall band gap. The defect density in these materials is a result of the presence of odd 5- and 7-\nfold membered rings usually found towards the end of the CNTs. The emission from these \nmaterials is largely controlled by the high geometric enhancement. The FE properties of (CNC) \n 6\nAppl. Phys. Lett. 78, (2001) 2339\nfilms, consisting of nanotubes and nanoparticles embedded in a-C matrix, have also been \nrecently studied. [18] These films would have a high band gap but, but unlike the PAC film, also \nhave a high spin density due to the highly stressed nature of the deposited films. In this type of \nfilm it has been shown that the emission has been controlled by the heterojunction between the \ngraphitic nano-particles and the a-C:N matrix as well as the high internal \u03b2 factor.  In this way \nthe FE from these materials is a combination of both the hetrojunction interface between the \nnanoparticles and the matrix as well as being controlled geometric enhancement effects.   \nIn conclusion, the FE from different types of a-C:H films have been examined. STM \nmeasurements of DLC films show variation of the conductivity across the film surface with nm \nsized conductive regions surrounded by a more insulating matrix. A model of field enhancement \nbased upon the internal dielectric inhomogenities has been developed to explain the origin of the \nFE from DLC films. Extensions of this model to other forms of carbon based emitters have been \nproposed which may be used to explain many of the experimental observations from the \ndifferent types of emitters. \n \nThis work has been sponsored by the EPSRC no.
