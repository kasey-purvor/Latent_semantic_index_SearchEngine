His international prostate \nsymptom score (IPSS) is 22\/35 and he is very unhappy about his current condition.  A \ndigital rectal exam is benign with no appreciable nodules.  Given his overall good \nhealth and degree of symptoms, you recommend a transurethral resection of the \nprostate (TURP) which you consider the most effective treatment for symptomatic \nbenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  The patent is willing to undergo surgery but asks \nabout whether he could undergo one of more \u2018modern\u2019 minimal invasive treatment \nforms that he has heard good things about.  You decide to update your knowledge by \nsearching for the current best evidence on the surgical treatment of BPH.   \n \nClinical question \n \nIn patients with BPH (population), how effective are minimally invasive treatments \n(interventions), when compared with TURP (comparator), in improving symptom \nscores after surgery (outcome)? \n \nFinding the best evidence \n \nYou decide to look for a well-designed systematic review on this topic using \nPubMed.1  Two sets of searches using the terms \u2018benign prostatic hyperplasia\u2019 and \n\u2018minimally invasive surgery\u2019 that you combine with the AND function yields 266 \ncitations (date of search: October 12, 2009).  Using the Limits tub to apply a \n\u2018systematic review\u2019 filter from \u2018Subset\/Topic\u2019 limits the search results to 18 review \narticles.  Here, you identify a systematic review entitled \u2018Minimally invasive \ntreatments for benign prostatic enlargement: systematic review of randomised \ncontrolled trials\u2019 that addresses your research question.2   \n \nIn this review, 22 trials met the review inclusion criteria.  Of these, eight trials \nreported data on symptom scores 12 months after surgery (primary outcome).  Of \nthese, three trials compared TURP with transurethral microwave treatment (TUMT), \none with transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) and four with laser coagulation.  You \nImamura 2010.doc 15\/11\/2010 EBU in Practice: Heterogeneity \n3 \n \nalso notice that the review produced a quantitative summary of results across studies \n(a meta-analysis) for each comparison.  The individual trial results and the summary \nresult are shown visually in a \u2018forest plot\u2019 figure (Figure 1).   \n \nEvaluating the methods \n \nCriteria for assessing validity of review articles have been previously described.3  You \ndecide to use the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and \nMeta-Analyses) checklist,4 and are satisfied that the methods of the systematic review \nwere strong.  Turning to the results, you now assess whether the results are similar \n(consistent) from study to study; in other words, whether there is any heterogeneity \namong studies included in the systematic review.   \n \nWhat is heterogeneity? \n \nIn interpreting the results of a meta-analysis, it is important to consider not just the \nsummary result but the degree to which the individual studies assess the same clinical \nquestion and that their results agree.  Where the included patients and application of \nthe interventions broadly similar? Are the results consistent (homogeneous) or do they \nvary so much that the summary is not reliable?  Variability in the study results beyond \nthat which could be expected by chance is called (statistical) heterogeneity.  To some \nextent, it is inevitable that the estimated effects of a specific intervention will vary \nfrom study to study since two studies are never identical in design and conduct.5  \nHowever, assessment of heterogeneity is not purely a statistical issue but also \ninvolves clinical judgement as to whether it is sensible to combine individual studies \nor not.  Such considerations should occur prior to conducting a meta-analysis. \n \nThe first step for identifying heterogeneity is to visually inspect the forest plot.  Is the \ndirection and magnitude of effect consistent across studies?  Do the confidence \nintervals for individual trials tend to overlap?  A large difference in the point \nestimates with a lack of overlap in confidence intervals would indicate the presence of \nheterogeneity. \n \nImamura 2010.doc 15\/11\/2010 EBU in Practice: Heterogeneity \n4 \n \nThe second step is to look at a statistical test of homogeneity (i.e. no \nheterogeneity).,The result of such a test is commonly shown in forest plots and it \nformally assesses whether there is evidence of heterogeneity.  A statistically \nsignificant result from this test (conventionally assessed using a p-value of 0.10 as \nopposed to 0.05 due to low sensitivity) indicates systematic variability in study results \nbeyond chance.  Another way of expressing this information is through the I2 statistic \nthat quantifies the inconsistency of study estimates. 5,6  The I2 ranges from 0% to \n100% with larger values indicating a greater proportion of variability is attributable to \nheterogeneity.  As a rough guideline, I2 values higher than 50% may indicate a \nmoderate to severe heterogeneity that requires caution.6  Such statistical approaches \nare no panacea; they are influenced by the number and size of studies included in the \nmeta-analysis and the underlying level of heterogeneity.5,7 The magnitude of \nheterogeneity (\u03c42 value) could also be considered. When heterogeneity should be \nconsidered problematic is debatable.   \n \nIn our example for the outcome of reduction in symptom scores after surgery, of the \nfour trials comparing laser coagulation with TURP, three trials have point estimates \n(mean difference) greater than 0 (suggesting TURP is better than laser coagulation), \nwhereas the other has point estimates less than 0 (suggesting laser coagulation is \nbetter; see Figure 1).  Looking at the confidence intervals for the same comparison, \nthe intervals are quite diffuse.  The p-value for the \u03c72 test is less than 0.10 signifying \nstatistical evidence of heterogeneity.  The corresponding I2 is over 80% suggesting a \nhigh level of heterogeneity.  Caution is therefore required in interpreting such results.  \nSimilarly for the comparison of  TUMT with TURP, the confidence interval of one of \nthe studies (de la Rosette) does not overlap with the other two; Again, this is reflected \nin a high I2 value of 84%. \n \nCauses of heterogeneity \n \nWe distinguish the potential sources of heterogeneity (clinical and methodological \ndifferences) from observing (statistical) heterogeneity in the results.  Variation in the \nestimated intervention effects may reflect differences in patient characteristics, the \nstudy setting, or how the interventions were implemented in the included studies \nImamura 2010.doc 15\/11\/2010 EBU in Practice: Heterogeneity \n5 \n \n(clinical heterogeneity).  Differences in findings may also result from methodological \ndifferences (methodological heterogeneity) such as failure to introduce important \nmethodological safeguards against bias such as allocation concealment and blinding.   \n \nIn our example, the review authors postulate that differences in prostate size and \nsymptom score at baseline may be important sources of heterogeneity observed when \nlooking at the results after surgery.  For laser coagulation, the authors also noted \nvariation in operative technique and treatment protocols between trials (e.g. power \nsettings, temperature and site or duration of laser application).  They noted that it was \ndifficult to assess their possible impact on intervention effects, as many trials did not \ndescribe the technologies used in sufficient details, a problem regularly encountered \nwhen conducting systematic reviews.  \n \nWhat can we do when there is heterogeneity? \n \nIn the presence of large unexplained heterogeneity investigators may choose not to \npool the study results and only report the results of the individual studies.  \nInvestigators may decide to conduct a random effects meta-analysis as was done for \nour example.  Use of a random-effects model does not remove heterogeneity but \nformally allows for a degree of variability between individual trial results (random \neffects) while still assuming overall coherence.  When there is heterogeneity, the \nconfidence intervals around the summary (overall) estimate in the random-effects \nanalysis will be wider than the corresponding one from a fixed-effect analysis.  Many \ntherefore see the random-effects approach as the more conservative (and arguably the \ndefault) option.8  However, compared to a fixed-effect meta-analysis, smaller studies \nwill be given more influence in a random-effects meta-analysis.  Particular care is \nrequired when trial size varies greatly or there are few studies.  This difference can be \nseen in Figure 2 where the random effects analysis of the same studies is conducted \nand the point estimate and the confidence interval for the summary estimate differ.  \n \nApplying the results to the care of your patient \n \nHaving applied the outlined methodology to assess the impact of heterogeneity in the \ncase study, you take a cautious approach.  Current evidence does not support \nImamura 2010.doc 15\/11\/2010 EBU in Practice: Heterogeneity \n6 \n \nminimally invasive treatments over TURP in terms of symptoms at 12 months, let \nalone does there appear to be any high quality evidence on the long-term outcomes in \nthe published literature.  Indeed, current best available evidence supports TURP over \nTUNA and tends to favour TURP over the other two minimally invasive treatments.  \nGiven this, you explain to your patient that the evidence suggests TURP to be at least \nas good as minimally invasive treatments and possibly the superior treatment of \nLUTS secondary to BPH in terms of symptom control at 12 months.  You would also \nwant to apply the same approach to the other important outcomes reported such as \npeak urine flow, the need for reoperation and possible adverse effects.   \n \nConclusion \n \nUrologists are often faced with systematic reviews of individual clinical trials with \ninconsistent results.  In this case, it is important to assess the extent and magnitude of \nheterogeneity and ask whether investigators have sufficiently explored clinical and \nmethodological sources of heterogeneity, which was the focus of a previous BJUI \narticle.9  Uncritical interpretation of meta-analysis can be misleading and misguide \nclinical practice.  The ability to recognize and interpret heterogeneity is therefore \ncritical to evidence-based practice of urology.   \n \nConflict of interest \n \nNone declared. \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nWe thank T\u00e2nia Louren\u00e7o (University of Aberdeen) for providing the original \u2018forest \nplot\u2019 figures and helpful comments.   \nImamura 2010.doc 15\/11\/2010 EBU in Practice: Heterogeneity \n7 \n \nReferences \n \n1.
