Furthermore, there are also opportunity costs to\nthese activities, and often, increased predation risk\n(Tuttle and Ryan, 1981; Burk, 1982; Hosken et al., 1994).\nIn addition to these costs, which are paid whether or not\ncopulation takes place, there are also potential costs that\nare directly related to the act of copulation itself. For\nexample, male genitalia or toxic seminal fluid can harm\nfemales (for example, Chapman et al., 1995; Crudgington\nand Siva-Jothy, 2000; Blanckenhorn et al., 2002; Wigby\nand Chapman, 2005). There may also be costs associated\nwith gamete production (Kenagy and Trombulak, 1986;\nVan Voorhies, 1992) and seminal fluid\u2014or some other\naspects of copulation\u2014can lead to downregulation of the\nimmune system (for example, Siva-Jothy et al., 1998;\nHodgson and Hosken, 2006; but see Schwarzenbach\net al., 2005).\nCosts of copulation are reasonably well documented\nfor females (for example, Thornhill and Alcock, 1983;\nArnqvist and Rowe, 2005), but there have been fewer\ninvestigations of these costs for males (Hunt et al., 2006).\nStrategic ejaculation (for example, Gage, 1991; Gage and\nBaker, 1991; Simmons et al., 1993; Martin and Hosken,\n2002; reviewed in Wedell et al., 2002) provides indirect\nevidence that copulation is costly for males, otherwise\nfacultative ejaculate adjustment would not be advanta-\ngeous. There is also more direct evidence that copulation\nis costly for males (for example, Clutton-Brock and\nLangley, 1997; Martin and Hosken, 2004). For example,\nlongevity is negatively associated with copulation\nnumber for male Saltella sphondylli (Martin and Hosken,\n2004). However, the few available estimates of cost of\ncopulation for males are typically phenotypic, and it is\nunclear whether there is a genetic basis to trade-offs\nbetween aspects of copulation and other male characters.\nThere are theoretical reasons to expect this would be\nthe case (Roff, 2002), and much of the controversy\nregarding trade-offs between reproductive investment\nand other characters is probably due to the fact that\nthese associations are often only measured at the\nphenotypic level (Reznick, 1985; Roff, 2002). Indeed,\nsome authors have gone so far as to say that without\ngenetic estimates, a bona fide trade-off cannot be shown\n(Rose and Charlesworth, 1981; Reznick, 1985; but see\nRoff, 2002).\nIn addition to the paucity of estimates of male mating\ncosts, estimates of heritability of copulatory behaviour\nare also relatively uncommon (Mu\u00a8hlha\u00a8user et al., 1996).\nBehaviour typically has a relatively large environmental\ncomponent (Mousseau and Roff, 1987), and it is also\nfrequently highly stereotypical, especially mating beha-\nviour, further suggesting there may often be little\nadditive-genetic variation for aspects of mating beha-\nviour. However, copulation duration is heritable in\nseveral taxa (for example, MacBean and Parson, 1967;\nGromko et al., 1991), including seed beetles (Savalli\nand Fox, 1998) and can be an important male fitness\ncomponent (Simmons et al., 1996).\nReceived 14 January 2009; revised 12 June 2009; accepted 18 June\n2009\nCorrespondence: Dr DJ Hosken, Centre for Ecology and Conservation,\nSchool of Biosciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Tremough,\nPenryn, TR10 9EZ, UK.\nE-mail: d.j.hosken@exeter.ac.uk\n3Current address: Department of Animal & Plant Science, University of\nSheffield, Sheffield, UK\nHeredity (2009), 1\u20136\n& 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0018-067X\/09 $32.00\nwww.nature.com\/hdy\nHere, we estimate the cost of a single copulation in the\nseed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. Previous work on\nthis species indicates that mating can be costly for both\nmales (Paukku and Kotiaho, 2005) and females (Tatar\net al., 1993; Crudgington and Siva-Jothy, 2000; Eady et al.,\n2007). Copulating females kick their mates vigorously\nduring the last third of copulation (Qi and Burkholder,\n1982; Eady, 1991). This behaviour reduces copulation\nduration and mitigates to an extent the injuries caused by\nthe spiny male genitalia (Crudgington and Siva-Jothy,\n2000; Edvardsson and Tregenza, 2005). However, there\nhas been no investigation of how, or if, variation in\ncopulation duration influences mating costs in male C.\nmaculatus. Moreover, previous estimates of male mating\ncosts are only phenotypic (Paukku and Kotiaho, 2005),\nand these may or may not reflect genetic associations\n(Lynch and Walsh, 1998). Our study of the costs of\ncopulation is conducted in a quantitative genetic frame-\nwork that allows us to estimate the genetic correlation\nbetween copulation duration and subsequent male\nlongevity, as well as the heritability of several male\nfitness components, including copulation duration. Our\nresults indicate that longevity is negatively influenced by\nthe duration of a male\u2019s first copulation, at both the\nphenotypic and genetic levels and that there is significant\nadditive-genetic variation in both characters.\nMaterials and methods\nC. maculatus is a widely distributed pest on stored\nlegumes. Its eggs are attached to beans, and the larvae\ndevelop inside the bean. The beetles used in this\nexperiment were derived from a wild-type stock popula-\ntion, originating from Niamey, Niger and maintained in\nthe University of Lincoln at a population size of\napproximately 500 individuals on ca. 2000 black-eyed\nbeans Vigna unguiculata at 27 1C (with a 16:8 h light\/dark\nphotoperiod) for hundreds of generations. Twenty\ngenerations before the experiment, the population size\nwas increased to ca. 2500 individuals (on 250 g of black-\neyed beans). Under normal culture conditions, adult\nbeetles do not feed or drink, surviving instead on\nresources accrued during the larval stage.\nApproximately 200 females from the mass culture\nwere allowed to oviposit for 6 h on ca. 3000 black-eyed\nbeans. At this density, we expect females to lay one egg\nper bean (Horng, 1997). Before emergence, randomly\nchosen beans were removed and isolated in \u2018virgin\nchambers\u2019 (48-well cell culture plates, VWR International\nLtd, Lutterworth, UK). If beans contained more than one\nemerging adult, the beetles were removed as they\nemerged, and if this occurred simultaneously, only\ngroups of emerged adults of the same sex were retained\nand used in subsequent (parental) matings. Adults\nemerging from these beans were subsequently used to\ngenerate sib-ships (full-sib\/half-sib families) used to\nestimate genetic parameters (see Statistical analyses\nbelow). Briefly, virgin males (sires) and females (dams)\n(all 24\u201348 h old) were placed in individual 40mm\ndiameter Petri dishes for 10min or until they mated. If\nmating did not occur within 10min, a new virgin female\nwas placed in the Petri dish and the previous female\ndiscarded. Dams were subsequently transferred to Petri\ndishes containing approximately 120 black-eyed beans\nand remained there for the rest of their lives. Sires were\ntransferred to eppendorf tubes and rested there for 24 h\nuntil they were placed in a new 30-mm petri dish\ntogether with a new virgin female (dam). This process\nwas repeated after another 24 h, so that all sires mated\nwith three dams over a period of 3 days. In addition, a\nsubsample of sires (n\u00bc 46) were weighed before and\nafter their first mating to estimate the size of their first\nejaculate (this measure is repeatable\u2014weights before and\nafter copulation were measured two times for a small\nbeetle sample (N\u00bc 9) and weight loss (\u00bc ejaculate size)\nwas calculated two times from these. Regression of\nmeasure one on measure two indicates a very high\nrepeatability: R2\u00bc 0.967; b\u00bc 1.08; Po0.0001), and for 60\nsires we also measured their body size (mass) and\ncopulation duration. In total, 101 males were mated to\n303 females, but after excluding females that did not lay\neggs and families with less than two male offspring, data\nwere obtained from a total of 282 full-sib families (100\nsires) and 918 sons. Subsequent sample sizes vary\nsomewhat because of lost data or failure of all sons to\nmate as required (for example).\nVirgin sons emerging from these families were isolated\nas above (from beans with only one egg attached) and\nthe date of emergence was recorded. The first three sons\nto emerge from each family were subsequently placed\nwith an unrelated virgin female (also collected from the\nsire-dam matings above) until they mated (the use of\ndaughters in these matings also enabled us to estimate\nthe heritability of copulation duration through female\noffspring). As before, matings were staged in Petri dishes\nwith 30mm diameter, but with each son mated to only\none female, and as above, a sample of sons were weighed\nbefore and after copulation to estimate ejaculate size and\nsubsequently, its heritability. We chose sons from sires in\nthe top and bottom 10% of the sire ejaculate size\ndistribution as this minimises the sample sizes required\nfor sire\u2013son (parent\u2013offspring) regression, while main-\ntaining experimental power (Hill, 1970). We thus\nobtained ejaculate size for 18 sires and 46 sons. Once\npaired, the beetles were observed continuously until they\nfinished mating. Courting males approach females from\nbehind and antennate females\u2019 backs while attempting to\nmount. Once males successfully insert their aedeagus,\nthey cease waving their antennae and lean back,\nremaining motionless (Savalli and Fox, 1998). This shift\nin posture and behaviour was scored as initiation of\nmating. The point at which sons and their mates\nphysically separated was taken as the end of copulation.\nFor each mating, we estimated copulation duration as the\ntime between copulation start and male\u2013female separa-\ntion. Sons were then placed in individual eppendorf\ntubes and checked daily until death. As we knew their\nage at mating, this allowed us to calculate the total\nlongevity of sons and their longevity after copulation.\nStatistical analyses\nCopulation duration, longevity after copulation and age\nat copulation were transformed (Log10 or Box-Cox) to\nimprove normality and residuals in all analyses were\nnormal (P40.6) and there were no associations between\npredicted and residual values. However, estimation of\nthe genetic parameters was virtually identical when\ntransformed or untransformed data were used in our\nanalyses, so estimates from the untransformed data are\nMale mating costs\nEA Brown et al\n2\nHeredity\npresented here\u2014their interpretation is easier (see Fal-\nconer, 1989). The phenotypic association between copu-\nlation duration and subsequent longevity was assessed\nusing linear regression. Analyses of genetic variation\nwere conducted on sire and dam variance components\nestimated with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (SPSS).\nSignificance of the sire estimates was tested with G-tests.\nFor ejaculate size, sire\u2013son regression (following recom-\nmendations of Hill, 1970) was employed. Sire estimates\nof heritability are our focus because dam estimates are\nconfounded by common environment and dominance\neffects (Lynch and Walsh, 1998; Roff, 2008). Coefficients\nof additive-genetic variation were also calculated, ac-\ncording to Houle (1992), because they may be a more\nappropriate measure for comparing potential responses\nto selection (Price and Schluter, 1991). These coefficients\nof additive variation were calculated using untrans-\nformed values as recommended (Houle, 1992). The\ngenetic correlation between copulation duration and\nsubsequent son\u2019s survival were estimated following\nBecker (1985), using the sums of cross products from a\nnested MANOVA (SPSS). However, the ReML heritabil-\nity estimates and s.e. were used in the calculation of rG\nrather than those derived from the MANOVA because of\nthe unbalanced (final) design (ReML is recommended for\nunbalanced designs\u2014Lynch and Walsh, 1998). Only this\ngenetic correlation was estimated as potential costs of\nreproduction were the focus of this article. We also used\nsire family means to further assess the association\nbetween copulation duration and male longevity as\nfamily level correlations also provide an estimate of\ngenetic correlations (Lynch and Walsh, 1998).\nResults\nThere was a significant negative association between\ncopulation duration and subsequent longevity in sons at\nthe phenotypic level (Figure 1). This was true whether\ncopulation duration was the only predictor in our model\n(r2\u00bc 0.04; b\u00bc\u00020.24; F1,768\u00bc 30.9; Po0.001), or if we\nincluded son\u2019s age at copulation as an additional\npredictor variable (Overall model r2\u00bc 0.17; F2,749\u00bc 77.3;\nPo0.001. Copulation duration, b\u00bc\u00020.13; t\u00bc\u00023.23;\nP\u00bc 0.001. Age at copulation, b\u00bc\u00020.04; t\u00bc\u000211.016;\nPo0.001). Therefore, at the phenotypic level it appears\nthat males that copulate for longer have reduced long-\nevity. However, with a much reduced sample size, there\nwas no phenotypic association between copulation\nduration and ejaculate size (body weight lost during\ncopulation) (F1,44\u00bc 1.1; P\u00bc 0.3), nor was there an\nassociation between male size (weight) and copulation\nduration (F1,58\u00bc 1.35; P\u00bc 0.25).\nAll traits measured were significantly heritable\n(Table 1) except for ejaculate size (h2\u00bc\u00020.026; F1,16\no0.0001; P\u00bc 0.92), and for these significant estimates,\nCVA varied from 51.2 to 117.5 (Table 1), all of which\nindicates there is significant potential for copulation\nduration, longevity and residual (after copulation) long-\nevity to evolve. Furthermore, copulation duration was\nheritable through daughters and sons, and additive\nvariation and heritabilites were comparable in both\ninstances. As with the phenotypic association, there\nwas also a negative correlation between longevity after\ncopulation and copulation duration (rG\u00bc\u00020.16\u00b10.2),\nalthough as with genetic correlations generally, the errors\non this estimate were relatively large, even with our\nsubstantial sample size. Nevertheless, the sign of this\nassociation is informative (Lynch and Walsh, 1998) and it\nindicates there is a negative genetic association between\nthese characters. This inference is supported by sire\nfamily level associations between these two traits, which\nwere also negative (b\u00bc\u00020.45; F1,97\u00bc 6.75; P\u00bc 0.01).\nDiscussion\nThe duration of males\u2019 first copulation was negatively\nassociated with their longevity at both the phenotypic\nand genetic level, and both these traits had substantial\nadditive-genetic variance. The phenotypic association\ncould be due to general male quality, with poor quality\nmales taking longer to copulate and dying quicker.\nHowever, the negative genetic correlation suggests that\nthere is a genuine trade-off between male reproductive\neffort and longevity, and genotypes that invest more in\nthe duration of their first copulation, die faster. Further-\nmore, the phenotypic association occurs when we control\nfor male age at mating, so it is not simply that older\nmales mate for longer. We also acknowledge that the s.e.\nFigure 1 The negative phenotypic association between copulation\nduration (x axis) and male longevity (in days after copulation (that\nis, controlling for age at copulation hence residual)) (y axis). Shown\nhere are the untransformed data. This relationship is also negative\nwithout controlling for male age at the time of copulation and\nremoving the copulations longer than 25min only increases the\nnegative slope.\nTable 1 Phenotypic means and genetic estimates for the traits we measured that had significant heritabilities\nTrait N Mean\u00b1s.e.

In addition, correlations at the family\nlevel approximate genetic correlations (Lynch and Walsh,\n1998), and hence the congruence between these two\nanalyses supports the notion that copulation duration\nand longevity are negatively genetically correlated. In\ntotal then, we provide evidence for a phenotypic trade-\noff, and for a genetic trade-off. The former defines the\nfitness surface and selection, the latter, together with\nsignificant trait heritability, facilitates a corresponding\nevolutionary response to any selection because the sign\nof the two associations are the same\u2014all else being equal\n(Roff, 2002). These findings are therefore consistent with\na standard assumption of life-history models\u2014invest-\nment in reproduction trades-off with longevity (Roff,\n2002)\u2014but if and how this trade-off varies across\nenvironments (for example, Czesak and Fox, 2003)\nremains to be investigated. In addition, how further\ncopulations influence this trade-off also needs to be\nassessed, but male investment is greatest in their first\ncopulation (Savalli and Fox, 1999), which is why we\nfocused on this here.\nPrevious phenotypic findings in this species suggested\nthat mating has a negative effect on male survival\n(Paukku and Kotiaho, 2005). Our findings are consistent\nwith this and additionally indicate that the duration of a\nmales first copulation, rather than ejaculate size, is linked\nto the reduction in longevity at both the phenotypic and\ngenetic level. In apparent contrast with our findings,\nprevious work also indicates that larger males could\ncopulate for longer (Paukku and Kotiaho, 2005) and live\nfor longer. However, the previously reported effect of\nsize on longevity was marginal, moderate (r\u00bc 0.16) and\ninconsistent across experiments (Paukku and Kotiaho,\n2005). As a result we did not measure size for all our\nbeetles and furthermore we were interested in the\nfundamental genetic correlations, not in how phenotypic\ntrade-offs may be mediated, whether this is via size or\nvia a combination of phenotypic traits (as seems likely).\nHowever, we found no significant association between\nmale size and copulation duration at the phenotypic\nlevel, which tentatively suggests the survival cost to\nlonger copulations is not solely mediated by male size.\nOverall, the work on C. maculatus indicates that there are\nsubstantial costs of mating for males, as reported for\nother taxa (for example, Partridge and Farquhar, 1981;\nClutton-Brock and Langley, 1997; Hunt et al., 2002;\nMartin and Hosken, 2004), and for female C. maculatus\n(Tatar et al., 1993; Messina and Fry, 2003). Part of this\nsubstantial effect of copulation duration on male long-\nevity may be due to the fact that in our population males\ndo not feed or drink as adults, but provide females with a\nsubstantial ejaculate that can be up to 10% of body mass\n(Paukku and Kotiaho, 2005). This means that males are\nlosing both energy and water in their ejaculate, as\nsuggested by the dramatic decline in ejaculate size with\nsuccessive matings (Savalli and Fox, 1999). It is unclear\nhowever, if males that copulate for longer transfer larger\nejaculates to females. The limited data we have on this\nsuggests not, and similarly, Savalli and Fox (1998) also\nfind no evidence that copulation duration is associated\nwith ejaculate size (phenotypically or genetically). How-\never, Edvardsson and Canal (2006) manipulated copula-\ntion duration experimentally showed that longer\ncopulations resulted in the transfer of heavier ejaculates.\nNonetheless, the proximate mechanism for our pheno-\ntypic result is not immediately obvious, but the associa-\ntions we detected are frequently only seen under stress\n(Roff, 2002), as here (where no water or nutrients were\nsupplied to the adults). In addition, ejaculate mass is\nonly one measure of important\/costly products that\nmales transfer to females so mass-cost associations\nare possibly simplistic. Another potential mechanistic\nexplanation for the copulation duration\u2013longevity asso-\nciation is that traits, which give males more control over\ncopulation duration are costly and result in reduced\nlongevity because of this, although this needs to be\nsubstantiated. Regardless of the mechanism however, the\nnegative genetic association between copulation dura-\ntion and longevity shows that genotypes that copulate\nfor longer in their first copulation, live shorter lives.\nWhether this association varies across environments and\npopulations remains to be established.\nGenetic trade-offs between reproductive effort and\nlongevity have been reported in a range of taxa (Gasser\net al., 2000; Zwaan et al., 1995; see Prasad and Joshi, 2003\nfor a discussion in Drosophila melanogaster). Hunt et al.,\n(2006) used artificial selection on male longevity to assess\npotential trade-offs with reproductive effort in a cricket.\nThey found that in lines selected for decreased longevity,\nmales began sexual signalling at a younger age, signalled\nmore per night and more over their shorter life-spans\nthan males from lines selected for increased longevity.\nThese results were interpreted, among other things, as\nevidence for the costliness of sexual selection. Our results\nsuggest that copulation itself can be costly, as suggested\nfor other traits like ejaculate and sperm size (Dewsbury,\n1982; Pitnick et al., 1995; Hosken, 2001). Other examples\nof genetic trade-offs have usually focused on females, but\nas with Hunt et al. (2006) and our study, published work\ntypically finds negative genetic correlations between\nreproductive effort (for example, fecundity) and long-\nevity (for example, Zwaan et al., 1995; Miyatake, 1997).\nAll the traits we measured were significantly heritable,\nexcept ejaculate size. This may have been due to the\nsmaller sample size for the ejaculate size sire\u2013son\nregression (but see Hill, 1970), although Savalli and Fox\n(1998) also found no significant sire component to\nejaculate size variation. However, they reported a\nsignificant dam estimate, but because dam additive\nvariances are contaminated with dominance and envir-\nonmental variance, it is unclear how to interpret this\nfinding. In addition, Savalli and Fox (1998) reported\ncopulation duration heritability estimates that were very\nclose to ours (0.25 and 0.35 vs 0.26 and 0.36), although\nunlike here they only found an effect via daughters not\nsons. They interpreted this as evidence for female\ndetermination of copulation duration, but our data\nsuggest this is not the case in our population and that\nmales and females determine how long copulation lasts.\nThe difference between these two studies is not surpris-\ning as the animals used have different founders (gene\nfrequencies partly determine heritabilities; Falconer,\n1989), and estimates of inheritance patterns of seed-\nbeetle ejaculate size also apparently differ across popula-\ntions (Savalli and Fox, 1998; Savalli et al., 2000).\nFurthermore, even studies replicated across labs with\nthe same animals can generate very different outcomes\nMale mating costs\nEA Brown et al\n4\nHeredity\n(Ackermann et al., 2001), consistent with theory (Fal-\nconer, 1989). However, the fact that copulation duration\nwas significantly heritable through daughters and sons\ndoes not change our interpretation of the male copula-\ntion duration\u2013longevity trade-off\u2014sons were mated to a\nrandom assortment of females and this could not\ngenerate the negative genetic association within sons or\nacross families. The heritability of copulation duration\nwas also similar to that found in other taxa. For example,\nGromko et al. (1991) also reported realised heritabilities\nof around 23% and Mu\u00a8hlha\u00a8user et al. (1996) reported a\nvalue of 0.39 in yellow dung flies. In the dung fly,\ncopulation duration is an important fitness component\nbecause it determines the quantity of rival male sperm\ndisplaced, and hence a male\u2019s paternity share (Simmons\net al., 1996). Rival sperm also appear to be displaced\nusing self-sperm in C. maculatus (Eady, 1994), so\ncopulation duration is also likely to be an important\nmale fitness component here, even if the link between\ncopulation duration, ejaculate size and paternity remains\nunclear.\nIn a review of trait heritability, Mousseau and Roff\n(1987) reported mean values for a range of characters.\nThey found that on average, behavioural traits tended to\nhave higher heritability than life-history characters, and\ninterpreted this result in terms of selection eroding\nadditive-genetic variation in characters more closely\nrelated to fitness. We find the opposite pattern here as\ncopulation duration was less heritable than either\nmeasure of longevity, and more recently Roff (2002)\nreported smaller non-significant differences between\ncharacter classes that were significantly different in the\nolder analysis. Hoffmann (1999) has argued that compar-\ning the heritabilities of behavioural to other trait classes\nis probably meaningless because low repeatabilities of\nsingle-event measures rather than a history of directional\nselection may confound comparisons. Previous work on\nC. maculatus also found a genetic component and\nmaternal effects influencing longevity, and evidence for\nan additive-genetic component to male longevity (Fox\net al., 2004), as we find here. However, the relatively high\nvalues for measures of male longevity that we report\nmay reflect longevities relatively weak association with\nfitness in our stocks with our husbandry techniques\u2014\nthere is no advantage to living an extremely long time in\nour stocks\u2014although there is clearly selection on long-\nevity as animals must survive long enough to find\na mate.\nIn conclusion, we find evidence for a trade-off between\nan aspect of male reproductive effort (the duration of a\nmale\u2019s first copulation) and longevity. Thus males may\nbe similar to females in this regard. How this varies\nacross environments and male ages remains to be\ndetermined. Nevertheless, results are generally consis-\ntent with life-history theory and indicate that copulation\nduration, like other sexual characters, is costly.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project was funded by NERC and the Leverhulme\nTrust.
