Introduction51\nAnthropogenic hydrocarbon contamination of soil is a global issue throughout the52\nindustrialised world (Macleod et al., 2001; Brassington et al., 2007). In England and53\nWales alone, 12% of all serious contamination incidents in 2007 were hydrocarbon54\nrelated (Environment Agency, 2005). Soil acts as a repository for many hydrocarbons,55\nwhich is a concern due to their adverse impact on human health and their56\nenvironmental persistence (Jones et al., 1996; Semple et al., 2001). Consequently, UK57\nlegislation has been introduced enforcing that if risk is posed to human, water or58\necological receptors, contaminated land must be remediated to a level suitable for use59\n(Paton et al., 2005). Sustainable remediation has therefore become a desirable option60\nfor the treatment of hydrocarbon-contaminated soils (Semple et al., 2001).61\n62\nPredominately, hydrocarbon soil contamination is associated with the accidental63\nspillage and leakage of refined petroleum derived products (Pollard et al., 1994).64\nConsequently, potentially toxic and persistent contaminants, such as polycyclic65\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and mid to long-chained aliphatic hydrocarbons, are66\noften dispersed ubiquitously in the environment (Wild and Jones, 1995). Polycyclic67\naromatic and heavier aliphatic hydrocarbons, which have a stable recalcitrant68\nmolecular structure, exhibit high hydrophobicity and low aqueous solubility, are not69\nreadily removed from soil through leaching and voltalisation. In addition, as these70\nhydrocarbons \u2018weather\u2019 in soil, their bioavailability, phase partitioning, toxicity and71\ndegradability change (Brassington et al., 2007).72\n73\nThe degradation of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons has been widely studied and it74\nhas been established that microbial degradation is a key removal pathway of75\n4hydrocarbons from the soil matrix (Atlas, 1981; Leahy and Colwell, 1990; Cerniglia,76\n1992; Budzinski et al., 1998; Loser et al., 1999; Bogane et al., 2003). Primarily,77\ncontaminant bioavailability plays a pivotal role in hydrocarbon degradation in soil.78\nAdditional factors that influence the degradation process included soil pH, moisture79\nand organic matter content and hydrocarbon aqueous solubility, octanol-water80\npartitioning coefficient and structure (Leahy and Colwell, 1990; Ram\u00edrez et al., 2008).81\nEffective biodegradation is dependent upon optimal biological (microbial82\nfunctionality and biomass size), chemical (bioavailability and nutrients) and physical83\n(water holding capacity) parameters.84\n85\nIt is acknowledged that with \u2018weathering\u2019, the hydrocarbon bioavailability changes.86\nThis impacts upon the relative toxicity of the hydrocarbons and their susceptibility to87\nbiodegradation, assessed for bioremediation purposes (Brassington et al., 2007;88\nRam\u00edrez, et al., 2008). Bioassays may be used to evaluate the potential of indigenous89\nsoil microbial populations to degrade representative petroleum hydrocarbons, the90\nimpact these hydrocarbons have upon microbial activity and provide information on91\nthe bioavailability of contaminants in soils (Chaineau et al., 1995; Reid et al., 2000;92\nStokes et al., 2005).Through the measurement of lag phases (time prior to93\nmineralisation reaching 5 %), and maximum rates and extents of a 14C-labelled target94\nhydrocarbon, in laboratory based mineralisation assays, biodegradation performance95\nand justifiable end points can be accurately assessed (Macleod et al., 2001).96\n97\nThe hypotheses for this study were (i) soils contaminated with high concentrations of98\nweather petroleum hydrocarbons have active indigenous microbial degrader99\npopulations able to degrade aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and (ii) the addition100\n5of nutrients and\/or hydrocarbon degraders will increase catabolic activity in these101\nsoils, and enhance hydrocarbon degradation. To address these hypotheses, the102\nfollowing aims were considered: (i) to describe the microbial degradation of 14C-103\nlabelled hexadecane, octacosane, phenanthrene and pyrene; (ii) to consider how104\ndegradation might be optimised in three genuinely hydrocarbon contaminated soils105\nfrom former petroleum refinery sites, and (iii) to investigate enhancing microbial106\nmineralisation of the target hydrocarbons by increasing microbial activity through (a)107\nnutrient amendment, (b) addition of hydrocarbon degraders and (c) combined nutrient108\nand degrader amendment.109\n110\n2. Materials and methods:111\n2.1 Materials112\nNon-labelled and 14C-labelled aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; [1-14C]113\nhexadecane-n (specific activity = 12.0 mCi mmol-1), [14, 15-14C] octacosane (specific114\nactivity = 20.5 mCi mmol-1), [9-14C] phenanthrene (specific activity = 55.7 mCi115\nmmol-1) and [4, 5, 9, 10-14C] pyrene specific activity = 48.5 mCi mmol-1), were all116\nsupplied by Sigma Aldrich Co, UK. Ultima Gold liquid scintillation cocktail was117\nobtained from Canberra Packard, UK. Merck, UK supplied the NaOH. The K2HPO4,118\nKH2PO4 and salicylic acid were obtained from Fisher Scientific, UK. BDH119\nLaboratory Supplies, UK supplied the NH4NO3. The hydrocarbon degrading inoculum120\nand Bushnell Hass was obtained from Remedios Limited, UK. Oxoid Ltd, UK121\nsupplied the plate count agar (Tryptone Glucose Yeast Agar), minimal agar and122\nRinger solution. Internal standards utilised in the TPH extractions; Nonadecane-d40,123\nTriacontane-d62, Naphthalene d8, Phenanthracene-d10, Chrysene-d12 and Perylene d12,124\nwere all purchased from Sigma Aldrich, UK.125\n6126\n2.2 Soil preparation and characterisation127\nThree different soils collected at a depth of 5 \u2013 20 cm from former oil refinery128\nfacilities were labelled A, B and C (to maintain owner anonymity). Soil A and C were129\nuntreated, whilst soil B had been previously biopiled. The soils were air-dried for 24 h130\nto enable them to be sieved through 2 mm, in order to remove stones, plant material131\nand facilitate mixing. Prior to air drying the field moisture content was determined in132\ntriplicate by oven drying at 105\u00b0C for 24 h. Soils were then stored at 4oC in the dark133\nbefore use.134\n135\nThe standard physical and chemical properties of each soil were analysed in triplicate136\n(Table 1). Following particle size analysis, determined using 40 \u00b1 0.1 g soil (dry wt)137\nas per the hydrometer method (Klute, 1986), and based upon the USDA texture138\nclassification system, soils A and B were categorised as clay and soil C as sandy clay139\nloam. The organic matter content (LOI) of each soil was measured by combustion at140\n450\u00b0C in a furnace for 24 h, according to ASTM Method D297487. Soils A and B141\nhad organic matter content of \u2264 15%, whilst soil C contained the highest amount of142\norganic matter (26.47 \u00b1 1.45 %) and organic carbon (15.39 \u00b1 0.84%; Table 1). All143\nsoils were determined to be slightly acidic with a pH range of 6.1 to 6.6, measured144\nwith a PHM 220 lab pH meter (Model 657R-00) in a 1:5 soil (dry wt) to liquid145\nsuspension, using 0.01 M calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution and then separately with146\ndeionised water.147\n148\nDetermination of the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration in the soil was149\nperformed by sequential ultrasonic solvent extraction as described by Risdon et al150\n7(2008). Total hydrocarbon petroleum (TPH), aliphatic and aromatic fractions were151\nidentified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a Perkin152\nElmer AutoSystem XL gas chromatograph coupled to a Turbomass Gold mass153\nspectrometer operated at 70 eV in positive ion mode. The column used was a Restek154\nfused silica capillary column (30 * 0.25 mm internal diameter) coated with RTX\u00ae-155\n5MS (0.25 \u00b5m film thickness). Splitless injection with a sample volume of 1\u00b5l was156\napplied. The oven temperature was increased from 60\u00b0C to 220\u00b0C at 20\u00b0C min-1 then157\nto 310\u00b0C at 6\u00baC min-1 and held at this temperature for 15 min. The mass spectrometer158\nwas operated using the full scan mode (range m\/z 50-500) for quantitative analysis of159\ntarget alkanes and PAHs. For each compound, quantification was performed by160\nintegrating the peak at specific m\/z. External multilevel calibrations were carried out161\nfor both oil fractions, quantification ranging from 0.5 to 2500 \u00b5g ml-1 and from 1 to 5162\n\u00b5g ml-1, respectively. Internal standards for the alkanes were nonadecane-d40 and163\nTriacontane-d62 and Napthalene d8, Phenanthracene-d10, Chrysene-d12 and Perylene164\nd12. For quality control, a 500 \u00b5g ml-1 diesel standard and mineral oil were analysed165\nevery 10 samples. In addition, duplicate reagent control and reference material were166\nsystematically used. The reagent control was treated in exactly the same manner as167\nthe samples but contained no soil. The reference material was an uncontaminated soil168\nof known characteristics, and was spiked with a diesel and mineral oil standard at a169\nconcentration equivalent to 16000 mg kg-1. High concentrations of TPH (\u22651.8%) were170\nmeasured in all soils (despite soil B having undergone an active remedial treatment).171\nSoil C contained the largest fraction of total aromatic hydrocarbons, and soil B172\naliphatic hydrocarbons.173\n174\n8Available ammonium and nitrogen was determined by extraction with 1 M KCl175\nsolution following the method by Stockdale and Rees (1994). Acetic acid-extractable176\nphosphorus was determined by shaking 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 g soil with 40ml of 2.5% acetic acid.177\nAll extracts were then filtered through Whatman 44 filter paper and analysed on a178\nflow injection analyzer (FIAstar). No significant levels of ammonium, nitrate and179\nphosphorus were detected in any of the three soils180\n181\nEnumeration of colony forming units (CFUs g-1 soil) for total heterotrophic and182\nhydrocarbon degrading microbes were estimated using the spread plate technique on183\nplate count agar and minimal agar supplemented with 0.1% diesel or enriched with184\nfour separate hydrocarbons (hexadecane, octacosane, phenanthrene and pyrene). Soil185\nwas extracted in a 1:10 ratio with quarter strength Ringer\u2019s solution, and then 1 ml of186\nthe extract serially diluted with Ringer\u2019s solution. The resultant solutions (0.1 ml)187\nwere then spread evenly over agar plates and incubated at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, with plate counts188\nperformed at 4, 7, 10 and 15 days. Soil B had the largest indigenous heterotrophic189\nmicrobial community, and number of diesel and PAH degraders. The greatest number190\nof aliphatic hydrocarbon degraders (hexadecane and octacosane) was in soil C (Table191\n1).192\n193\n2.3 Soil Spiking with Target Hydrocarbons194\nPrior to spiking, soils A, B and C were rehydrated with deionised water to 70% soil195\nwater holding capacity (32, 31 and 26 mg per 100 g soil dry wt, respectively).196\nSamples of each soil, (120 g wet wt) were then spiked with 12\/14C-labelled197\nhydrocarbons: hexadecane, octacosane, phenanthrene or pyrene using acetone as the198\ncarrier solvent to give a final 12C-hydrocarbon concentration of 50 mg kg-1 (dry wt)199\n9with a related 14C- activity of approximately 83 Bq g -1 soil (dry wt). Each soil-200\ncontaminant mixture was then blended following the method developed by Doick et al201\n(2003). Controls consisting of rehydrated soil (40 g wet wt) only were produced as202\nanalytical blanks.203\n204\n2.4 Mineralisation Assays205\nBiodegradation of the four 14C-labelled petroleum hydrocarbons in each of the three206\nsoils was measured (in triplicate) through the evolution of 14CO2 produced using the207\nmethod developed by this group (Semple et al., 2006). The mineralisation assay was208\nperformed in a \u2018respirometer\u2019: a modified 250 ml Schott bottle into which 10 \u00b1 0.1 g209\n(wet wt) soil along with 30 ml of mineral salts medium (MBS) was placed. Glass vials210\n(7 ml) containing 1 ml of 1 M NaOH were attached to the respirometer Teflon-lined211\nlids to trap the 14CO2 formed during the mineralisation assay.212\n213\nNon-amended respirometers were prepared as outlined above, with 10 \u00b1 0.1 g214\nhydrocarbon spiked soil (wet wt) and 30 ml of autoclaved MBS solution. To215\ninvestigate techniques to optimise the biodegradation of the target hydrocarbons,216\nrespirometers were also prepared as above but with the following treatments: nutrient217\namendment, hydrocarbon degrader amendment and combined nutrient and degrader218\namendment. The carbon content of the soils was calculated (measured TPH + 50mg219\nkg-1 12C-PAH added) to be 23.2 mg, 32mg and 20.2 mg g-1 (dry wt) soil for soils A, B220\nand C, respectively; and nutrients were added to respirometers, to give a C: N: P soil221\nratio of 100:10:1, (Leys et al., 2004). Nitrogen was given in the form of a 0.2 M222\nammonium nitrate solution (prepared using autoclaved deionised water), added to223\nrespirometers at 0.007 ml, 0.009 ml and 0.006 ml g-1 soil (wet wt), for soils A, B and224\n10\nC, respectively. Potassium was added to respirometers (0.007 ml, 0.010 ml and 0.007225\nml g-1 soil wet wt, for soils A, B and C respectively) via a 1 M potassium phosphate226\nbuffer (pH 7) prepared using anhydrous potassium orthophosphate and anhydrous227\ndipotassium orthophosphate.. The degrader amendment comprised of a commercial228\nmixed hydrocarbon degrader inoculum (identification unknown) able to utilise229\nhexadecane octacosane, phenanthrene and pyrene as a carbon source for growth. The230\ninoculum was cultured in autoclaved 3.27g l-1 Bushnell-Haas medium (prepared using231\ndeionised water, supplemented with 1000 mg l-1 salicylic acid and 1 % ethanol) at 20232\n\u00b1 1\u00b0C on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm. After 2 days incubation (stationary phase), the233\nhydrocarbon degrader inoculum was added to the respirometric flasks (0.1ml) such234\nthat numbers of cells rose to 106 cells g-1 dry wt soil. In respirometers amended with235\nnutrients and\/or degraders, MBS was added at 30 ml \u2013 amendment volume.236\n237\nRespirometers containing only rehydrated soil were also prepared as analytical blanks.238\nThe respirometers were placed on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm and incubated in the239\ndark at 20 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. At regular intervals (24 h) over an incubation period of 23 d the240\n14CO2 traps were replaced and 5ml Ultima Gold scintillation cocktail added to the241\nsampled vial. Following overnight storage to normalize the effects of chemi-242\nluminescence, the samples were counted by liquid scintillation counting LSC (Tri-243\nCarb 2250CA) and quantified using standard counting protocols and automatic244\nquench correction (Macleod and Semple, 2002).245\n246\n2.5 Statistical analysis247\nStatistical analysis of the results after blank correction was performed in SigmaStat248\nfor Windows (Version 2.03 SPSS). All graphs were presented using SigmaPlot 2000249\n11\nfor Windows (Version 6.10, SPSS). The respirometric data for the four treatments250\n(non amended, nutrient amended, inoculum amended and nutrient\/inoculum amended)251\nfor each soil were tested for significance by analysis of variance (ANOVA), using252\nTukey and\/or Student t-tests to investigate significant differences between lag phases,253\nmineralisation rates and overall mineralisation extents, between different soil254\ntreatments, where P\u22640.05.255\n256\n3. Results257\n3.1. Mineralisation of target hydrocarbons in soils.258\nHydrocarbon mineralisation in the three soils followed a standard 3-stage259\nmineralisation curve. Firstly, there was a lag phase where the indigenous microbial260\ncommunity adapted to their freshly amended hydrocarbon and mineralisation was261\nminimal (below 5%). Following this, there were increases in the rates of262\nmineralisation, as displayed by an \u2018exponential\u2019 phase; after which catabolic activity263\nreached a plateau (Figures 1-3).264\n265\nThe indigenous microbial communities in the three soils were able to mineralise each266\nof the 14C-target hydrocarbons (Figures 1-3; Tables 2-4). Rapid and extensive267\nmineralisation (\u2265 40%) and high catabolic activity was observed in each of the soils268\nspiked with 14C-phenanthrene (Figures 1-3). This initial high catabolic activity269\nresulted in significantly shorter (P \u22640.05) lag phases of 21.72 \u00b1 0.28 h in soil A, 9.03270\n\u00b1 0.68 h soil B and soil C 4.23 \u00b1 0.15 h, when compared to other 14C-hydrocarbons in271\nthe same soil. Furthermore, maximum rates of 14C-phenanthrene mineralisation were272\nstatistically quicker (P \u22640.05) in the three soils, than those of 14C-hexadaecane, 14C-273\noctacosane and 14C-pyrene (Tables 2-4). Conversely, there was no statistical274\n12\ndifference in the overall extents of mineralisation for 14C-phenanthrene between soils.275\nAlthough, differences in maximum 14C-phenanthrene mineralisation rates were276\nevident, with a significantly faster (P \u22640.05) rate of 2.37 \u00b1 0.08 % h-1 occurring in soil277\nC, in comparison to 1.11 \u00b1 0.04 % h-1 for soil A and 1.12 \u00b1 0.09 % h-1 for soil B.278\nSimilar observations were also observed for 14C-phenanthrene lag phases in each of279\nthe soils; it took less time for extents of mineralisation to reach 5% in soil C followed280\nby soil B, with soil A exhibiting the longest 14C-phenanthrene lag phase (Tables 2-4).281\nThe higher levels of phenanthrene degradation in soils B and C were also reflected by282\na significantly larger (P \u22640.05) number of phenanthrene degraders present in both283\nsoils (B, 4.1 x 105 \u00b1 1.3 x 105 CFU g-1) and (C, 4.3 x 105 \u00b1 2.9 x 105 CFU g-1),284\ncompared to soil A (1.8 x 104 \u00b1 2.9 x 103 CFU g-1).285\n286\nIn general, the ingenious microbial communities in the three soils exhibited less287\nability to mineralise 14C-pyrene, compared to other 14C-hydrocarbon amendments288\n(Figures 1-3). This reduced response to pyrene resulted in significantly higher (P289\n\u22640.05) lag phases in soils A, B and C, in comparison to other 14C-hydrocarbon lag290\nphases (Table 2-4). This response correlated with lower numbers of pyrene degraders,291\nin relation to hexadecane, octacosane and phenanthrene degraders, being present in292\nsoils A and C (Table 1). Significant differences in lag phases, maximum rates and293\noverall extents of mineralisation for 14C-pyrene were also apparent between the three294\nsoils. In soil B there were greater levels of catabolic ability with regard to the295\nmineralisation of 14C-pyrene than in soils A and C; the overall extent of 14C-pyrene296\nmineralisation was 1.72 and 1.43 times higher than in soils A and C, respectively297\n(Figures 1-3). This higher catabolic ability for pyrene also resulted in a significantly298\nfaster (P \u22640.05) maximum mineralisation rate of 0.29 \u00b1 0.01 % h-1, compared to 0.10299\n13\n\u00b1 0.00 % h-1 in soil A and 0.19 \u00b1 0.00 % h-1 in soil C. Furthermore, significantly more300\n(P \u22640.05) pyrene degraders were determined to be present in soil B, than in A and C301\n(Table 1).302\n303\nHigh levels of 14C-hexadecane mineralisation were apparent in soils A and C with304\noverall extents of mineralisation reaching 36.94 \u00b1 0.53% and 50.48 \u00b1 2.00%,305\nrespectively. Between soils, hexadecane associated catabolic activity was higher in306\nsoil C, which resulted in a significantly shorter (P \u22640.05) 14C-hexadecane lag phase307\nand significantly faster (P \u22640.05) maximum mineralisation rate than measured for308\nother soils (Tables 2-4). However, there was no significant difference (P \u22650.05)309\nbetween the number of hexadecane degraders in soils A and C(Table 1). Conversely,310\nthe microbial community in soil B demonstrated significantly lower (P \u22640.05) levels311\nof mineralisation towards this hydrocarbon, with only 20.00 \u00b1 0.66% 14C-hexadecane312\nmineralised over 23 d. This represents a decrease of 1.84 and 2.52 times on overall313\nextents of mineralisation for 14C-hexadecane in soils A and C, respectively. There was314\nalso significantly less (P \u22640.05) 14C-hexadecane mineralised in soil B in comparison315\nto the overall extents mineralised for other 14C-hydrocarbons in this soil (Figure 2,316\nTable 3). Lower levels of catabolic activity towards hexadecane in soil B further317\ncorrelated with the statistically significantly small (P \u22640.05) number of hexadecane318\nCFUs of 1.3 x 104 \u00b1 4.1 x 104 measured in this soil.319\n320\nThe indigenous microbial communities of all three soils exhibited high levels of321\ndegradation for octacosane, with rapid and extensive 14C-octacosane mineralisation322\nobserved over 23 d (Figures 1-3). In soils A and C, the microbial communities323\nexhibited greater ability to mineralise 14C-octaosane than 14C-hexadecane, 14C-324\n14\nphenanthrene and 14C-pyrene; overall extents of mineralisation for 14C-octaosane were325\nhigher than for other 14C-hydrocarbons in the same soil (Table 2 and 4). Between326\nsoils, there was lower octacosane degradative activity in soil B (45.84 \u00b1 0.68%), with327\noverall extents of mineralisation for 14C-octacosane significantly higher (P \u22640.05) at328\n54.93 \u00b1 1.30%, and 54.32 \u00b1 0.25% in soils A and C, respectively. No significant329\ndifference (P \u22650.05) in the overall extents of mineralisation was observed between330\nsoils A and C. 14C-octacosane was mineralised at a faster maximum rate of 0.91 \u00b1331\n0.01 % h-1 in soil C, compared to 0.54 \u00b1 0.04 % h-1 for soil A and 0.76 \u00b1 0.00 % h-1332\nfor soil B. Furthermore, the 14C-octacosane lag phase for soil C was significantly333\nshorter (P \u22640.05) by 122.34 h and 36.7 h compared to soils A and B, respectively334\n(Tables 2-4). This high level of octacosane degradation was also reflected by the335\npresence of a significantly larger (P \u22640.05) culturable octacosane degrader population336\ncompared to the other soils; 3.23 and 1.64 times more CFUs g-1 than in A and B,337\nrespectively (Table 1).338\n339\n3.2 Enhancement of 14C-target hydrocarbon mineralisation in soils340\nWith nutrient amendment the microbial communities in soils B and C exhibited341\ngreater ability to mineralise 14C-phenanthrene and 14C-pyrene (Figures 2 and 3). In342\ncomparison to non-amended soils (to which no N and P were added) overall extents of343\nmineralisation were significantly higher (P \u22640.05) in soil B by 13.55% and 30.52%,344\nand soil C by 40.41% and 17.33% for 14C- phenanthrene and 14C-pyrene, respectively.345\nNutrient addition also significantly enhanced (P \u22640.05) maximum rates of346\nmineralisation for 14C-pyrene in both these soils (Tables 3 and 4). For example, the347\nmaximum rate of mineralisation for 14C-pyrene was 0.26 \u00b1 0.02 % h-1, following348\nnutrient addition in soil C, and 0.19 \u00b1 0.00 % h-1 for the non-amended control.349\n15\nFurthermore, nutrient amendment to soil B resulted in the significantly highest (P350\n\u22640.05) overall extent of mineralisation for 14C-pyrene (61.32%) and the shortest lag351\nphase of 104.84 \u00b1 0.65 h. However, nutrient treatment did not result in (i) an increase352\nin maximum rates of mineralisation and (ii) decrease in lag phases for 14C-353\nphenanthrene in soils B and C (Tables 3 and 4). This treatment also had no significant354\neffect (P \u22650.05) on catabolic activity and the overall extent of mineralisation for 14C-355\nphenanthrene or 14C-pyrene in soil A (Figure 1).356\n357\nConversely, in nutrient treated soil A, overall extents of mineralisation for 14C-358\nhexadecane and 14C-octacosane were 2.19 and 1.45 times higher, respectively, than359\noverall extents measured for non-treated soils (Figure 1). This increase in catabolic360\nactivity was further reflected by a significant decrease (compared to non-amended361\nsoils) (P \u22640.05) in lag phases to (Table 2). Furthermore, with nutrient amendment362\nmaximum rates of mineralisation for 14C-hexadecane increased by 0.35 % h \u20131 in soil363\nA (Table 2). The overall extent of mineralisation for 14C-octacosane also increased by364\n\u2265 40% following nutrient amendment to 81.17 \u00b1 0.93% in soil C. This was not365\nsignificantly different to the overall extent mineralised in soil A (Figures 1 and 3). In366\nsoil B, overall extents of mineralisation for 14C-hexadecane were also significantly367\nhigher (P \u22640.05) with nutrient amendment (27.65 \u00b1 0.70%), compared to non-368\namended soil (20.00 \u00b1 0.66%), but was notably less than extents mineralised in soils369\nA and C (Figures 1-3).370\n371\nHydrocarbon degrader treatment also significantly increased (P \u22640.05) catabolic372\nability and overall extents of mineralisation for 14C-hexadecane and 14C-pyrene in all373\nsoils (Figures 1-3). This was the only treatment to increase the extent of374\n16\nmineralisation for 14C-hexadecane in soil C (Table 4). In comparison to non-amended375\nsoils, extents of mineralisation for 14C-hexadecane increased by 42% (A), 9% (B) and376\n23% (C); and by 4% (A), 26% (B) and 24% (C) for 14C-pyrene. However, this377\ntreatment did not enhance maximum rates of mineralisation for 14C-hexadecane or378\nreduce the lag phases for 14C-hexadecane in soils B and C (Tables 3 and 4).379\nConversely, increases in pyrene associated catabolic activity for all degrader -380\namended soils were reflected by faster maximum mineralisation rates and381\nsignificantly shorter (P \u22640.05) lag phases, in comparison to non-amended soils382\n(Tables 2-4). Compared to other treatments, degrader amendments also yielded the383\nmost extensive 14C-pyrene mineralisation over 23 d for soils A and C (Figures 1 and384\n3). However, in soils A and B extents of mineralisation for 14C-hexadecane were not385\nstatistically different (P \u22650.05) for degrader and nutrient treatments (Figures 1 and 2).386\n387\nWith bioaugmentation the percentage of 14C-phenanthrene mineralised in soil A388\ndecreased from 43.68 \u00b1 1.80% (non-amended soil) to 27.37 \u00b1 0.72%. This reduction389\nin catabolic activity resulted in a significant increase in 14C-phenanthrene (P \u22640.05)390\nlag phase (Table 2). When compared to non-amendment and other treatments in soil391\nA, there was also a significant decrease (P \u2264 0.05) in the maximum 14C- phenanthrene392\nmineralisation rate of \u2265 0.25 % h-1. Conversely, in soil C the overall extent of393\nmineralisation for 14C-phenanthrene was 29.35% higher following degrader treatment394\nin comparison to non-amended soil (Table 4). The overall extent of mineralisation for395\n14C-phenanthrene was also 2.55 and 1.61 times higher than measured for degrader396\ntreated soils A and B, respectively (Figures 1-3). Enhanced octacosane related397\ncatabolic activity, was also observed in soils A and C following degrader addition.398\nCompared to non-amended systems, extents of mineralisation increased from 54.93 \u00b1399\n17\n1.30% to 64.18 \u00b1 0.65% in soil A; and 54.32 \u00b1 0.25% to 84.82 \u00b1 1.31% in soil C.400\nAlthough, overall extents of mineralisation for 14C-octacosane and lag phases were401\nsimilar for nutrient and degrader treatments in soil C (Table 4). In comparison to non-402\namended soil, the overall extent and maximum rate of mineralisation for 14C-403\noctacosane significantly decreased by \u2265 10% and 0.61 % h-1 following degrader404\ntreatment in soil B (Figure 2, Table 3).405\n406\nFollowing combined nutrient + degrader treatment, an increase in catabolic activity407\nand ability to mineralise 14C-phenanthrene was observed in all soils. Significantly408\nhigher (P \u22640.05) extents of 14C-phenanthrene were mineralised in soils A, B and C, in409\ncomparison to non-amended, nutrient and degrader amended soils (Figures 1-3).410\nFurthermore, in relation to nutrient and degrader treatments, 14C-phenanthrene was411\nmineralised at significantly faster maximum rates (P \u22640.05) with shorter lag phases in412\nall soils treated with nutrient + degrader (Tables 2-4). Between soils, there was no413\nsignificant difference (P \u22650.05) in extents of mineralisation for nutrient + degrader414\ntreatments. Although, a faster rate of mineralisation for 14C-phenanthrene of 1.22 \u00b1415\n0.02 % h-1 was observed for soil C, compared to 1.22 \u00b1 0.02 % h-1 for soil A and 0.93416\n\u00b1 0.01 % h-1 for soil B. However, in respect to non-amended soils, nutrient + degrader417\namendment did not reduce lag phases or increase maximum rates of mineralisation for418\nall soils (Tables 2-4). Nutrient + degrader treatment also increased the overall extent419\nof mineralisation for 14C-pyrene to 41.10 \u00b1 0.36% in soil B and 30.90 \u00b1 0.19% in C.420\nWhen compared to nutrient and degrader treatments, extents of mineralisation were421\nsignificantly lower (P \u22640.05) in both soils for this treatment (Figures 2 and 3).422\nFurthermore, nutrient + degrader treatment was observed to have a negative effect423\nupon octacosane related catabolic activity in all soils (Figures 1-3). Compared to non-424\n18\namended soils, extent of mineralisation for 14C-octacosane was 6.59, 6.21 and 6.57425\ntimes lower in soils A, B and C, respectively (Tables 2-4). This reduction in catabolic426\nactivity was reflected by statistically significant increases (P \u22640.05) in 14C-octacosane427\nlag phases to 305.26 \u00b1 3.02 h, 273.65\u00b1 9.52 h and 338.13 \u00b1 8.79 h for soils A, B and428\nC, respectively. Nutrient + degrader treatment also did not cause increases in the rate429\nor extent of mineralisation for 14C-hexadecane in all soils (Figures 1-3). However, a430\nsignificant decrease (P \u22640.05) in 14C-hexadecane lag phases by 148 h and 4 h was431\nobserved for soils A and C, respectively, compared to non-amended soils (Tables 2-432\n4). In respect to non-amended soils, this treatment also increased the overall extent of433\nmineralisation for 14C-pyrene in soils B and C by \u2265 9% (Figures 2 and 3).434\n435\n4. Discussion436\n4.1 Catabolic activity of the indigenous microflora in soils A, B and C.437\nMany studies have documented the biological remediation of petroleum hydrocarbon438\ncontaminated sites (Trindade et al., 2005; Mancera-L\u00f3pez et al., 2008; Liu et al.,439\n2009) and it is widely acknowledged that for bioremediation strategies to be440\nsuccessfully applied, the potential for hydrocarbon biodegradation needs to be441\naccurately assessed (Head, 1998). In this present study, the microbial degradation of442\n14C-hexadecane, 14C-octacosane, 14C-phenanthrene and 14C-pyrene was assessed in443\nthree genuinely hydrocarbon contaminated soils from former refinery facilities, which444\nwere all contaminated with high concentrations of TPH (\u22651.8 % w\/w) and contained445\nonly trace concentrations of phosphorus and no ammonium or nitrate. Optimising the446\ndegradation of the 14C-target hydrocarbons through increasing microbial activity by447\nnutrient amendment (nitrogen and phosphorus addition), addition of hydrocarbon448\ndegraders and combined nutrient and degrader amendment was also investigated. The449\n19\nresults reveal that prior to treatments, the indigenous microbial communities in the450\nthree soils had the capability to degrade the representative 14C-petroleum451\nhydrocarbons, and significant microbial activity was observed in all of the452\ncontaminated soils. This is unsurprising due to the contamination histories of the soils,453\nwhich would result in extended exposure of the indigenous microbial communities to454\nselective hydrocarbons, and was further reflected by the large number of aliphatic and455\naromatic degraders in each of the soils (Table 1).456\n457\nExposure of microbial populations to hydrocarbons in contaminated environments has458\nbeen observed to result in a selective enrichment in the numbers of indigenous459\ndegrading organisms (Spain et al., 1980; Leahy and Colwell, 1990; Song et al., 1990;460\nAtlas, 1995) Furthermore, pre-exposure of microbial communities to hydrocarbons461\ncan effect degradation, with biodegradation rates influenced by contaminant462\nconcentration and prior exposure history (Spain and VanVeld, 1983; Aeolin et al.,463\n1989; Leahy and Colwell, 1990). This may be linked to hydrocarbon concentrations in464\neach of the soils. For example Grosser et al (1995) found that the mineralisation of 8465\ndifferent 14C-PAHs was faster and more extensive in genuinely hydrocarbon466\ncontaminated soils containing 8 to 15 times higher concentrations of total467\nhydrocarbons(% g-1 dry wt soil). In this current study, levels of indigenous microbial468\nactivity and mineralisation of 14C-pyrene were significantly higher (P \u22640.05) in soil B,469\nwhich contained the highest concentrations (mg kg-1) of pyrene and total TPH.470\nFurthermore, the largest diesel and pyrene degrader populations and their ratio in the471\nheterotrophic microbial community were enumerated in this soil. In contrast, more472\nextensive 14C-hexadecane and octacosane mineralisation occurred in soil C, which in473\nterms of aliphatic hydrocarbon burden contained the largest proportion of474\n20\nhexadecane\/octacosane (31.06% of total aliphatic hydrocarbon burden) in comparison475\nto soils A (26.27%) and B (21.42%), and the highest ratio of aliphatic hydrocarbon476\ndegraders to total heterotrophic microbial population numbers. Comparable findings477\nwere observed for 14C-hexadecane mineralisation in a study by Caparello and LaRock478\n(1975), who reported an increase in 14C-hexadecane mineralisation with increasing479\nhydrocarbon burden. It was concluded that hydrocarbon concentrations indicate480\ncatabolic ability of indigenous microbes and their oxidising potential towards481\nhydrocarbons (Caparello and LaRock, 1975).482\n483\nIn terms of soil physicochemical parameters, no definitive relationship was apparent484\nbetween 14C-hydrocarbon mineralisation parameters (lag phases, rates and extents of485\nmineralisation) in the control soils and soils pH, organic matter content and particle486\ncomposition. SOM is known to be predominant in orchestrating contaminant487\nsequestration, and reducing bioavailability. High levels of SOM were measured in soil488\nC, which contained \u2265 11% more soil organic matter (SOM) than soil A and B.489\nHowever, differences in hydrocarbon degradability (between soils) as a result of490\ndeclining bioavailability through contaminant sorption is suggested not to be a key491\nfactor in this study as all 14C-hydrocarbons were freshly spiked in to the soils492\n(Hatzinger and Alexander, 1997; Xing and Pignatello, 1997; Nam et al., 1998).493\nFurthermore, studies have reported that freshly added PAHs can desorb from soil494\nfaster than they are degraded (Calvillo and Alexander, 1996; Cornelissen et al., 1998).495\n496\n4.2 The role of treatments on microbial activity and implications for hydrocarbon497\nbioremediation.498\n21\nDepletion of essential nutrients can limit hydrocarbon biodegradation, especially in499\nsoils with high organic carbon contents (Breedveld and Sparrevik, 2000; Gallego et500\nal., 2001; Joo et al., 2001; Bento et al., 2005; Horel and Schiewer, 2009). For501\nexample, Horel and Schiewer (2009) demonstrated the addition of N and P releasing502\nfertilisers increased respiration (by 76% and 119%) over a 17 week period in503\ncontaminated Alaskan soil samples. In this current study, nutrient treatment in the504\nform of nitrogen and phosphorus (added to soils at a C:N:P ratio of 100:10:1)had a505\nstimulatory effect on catabolic activity, as in all soils extents of mineralisation,506\noverall, significantly increased for the target 14C-hydrocarbons. However, this507\nincrease in catabolic activity generally did not result in a decrease in 14C-hydrocarbon508\nlag phases, suggesting the added nutrients were being assimilated for microbial509\ngrowth (Bamforth and Singleton, 2005). In certain instances, the addition of nutrients510\nhad no significant effect on the overall extents of 14C-hydrocarbon mineralisation,511\nwhen compared to extents of mineralisation in non-amended soils to which no512\nnitrogen and phosphorus were added. Several studies have reported similar513\nobservations (Lehtomaki and Niemela, 1975; Seklemova et al., 2001; Chaineau et al.,514\n2005; Chaillan et al., 2006; Ram\u00edrez et al., 2008). This has been attributed to the515\nheterogeneity of soils, nutrient availability, toxicity of nutrient intermediaries and the516\npresence of nitrogen fixing bacteria (Bossert and Bartha, 1984; Mills and517\nFrankenberger, 1994; Seklemova et al., 2001; Sarkar et al., 2005). In this study there518\nwas no definitive evidence as to which of the factor\/s may have contributed to non-519\nincrease in mineralisation parameters, following nutrient addition.520\n521\nThere have been a number of findings on the use of commercially available microbial522\ninocula to remediate hydrocarbon contaminated soil, with some studies reporting523\n22\nincreased degradation and others negative or no effect on hydrocarbon degradation524\n(Jobsen et al., 1974; Goldstein et al., 1985; Capelli et al., 2001; Bento et al., 2005).525\nFor example, Bento et al (2005) investigated the effect bioaugmentation had on diesel526\ndegradation in soil samples from Long Beach and Hong Kong over a 12 week period.527\nOptimum biodegradation performance for Long Beach soil was achieved following528\nthe addition of a pre-selected microbial degrading consortium; whereas, this treatment529\nhad no significant effect on diesel degradation in the Hong Kong soils. In this current530\nstudy, bioaugmentation of the three soils with a mixed hydrocarbon degrader531\nconsortium enhanced hexadecane, phenanthrene and pyrene degradation. However,532\ndegrader treatment was deemed to be less successful than the nutrient only treatment,533\nwhich generally exhibited greater 14C-mineralisation. Furthermore, the use of both534\nnutrients and degrader inoculum as a combined soil treatment resulted in a decrease in535\nextent of mineralisation for 14C-octacosane, which reduced to \u2264 10 % in all three soils.536\nThis reduction in octacosane related catabolic activity may be the result of537\ncompetition between indigenous and introduced degrader populations in the soil538\n(Goldstein et al., 1985).539\n540\n5. Conclusion541\nThis study shows that the indigenous microbial communities in genuinely542\nhydrocarbon-contaminated soils have the potential to actively and extensively degrade543\ntarget aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, by enriching the microbial544\nactivity and number of degrading microbes in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils,545\nthrough biostimulation and bioaugmentation techniques, hydrocarbon degradation can546\nbe enhanced. However, the rate and extent of degradation will be dependent upon547\ntreatment type, contaminant structure, native hydrocarbon concentrations and548\n23\nmicrobial community. In this current study, as the indigenous microbial populations549\nof all three soils had an established and capable degrader population, the addition of550\ndegraders in this instance was not an effective solution to enhance the degradation of551\nthe 14C-contaminants in the soils. Similar observations have been noted and has been552\nsuggested the advantages of a bioaugmentation remediation approach rarely outweigh553\nthe costs involved. However, the successful bioremediation of hydrocarbon-554\ncontaminated soils is dependent upon many soil, contaminant and microbial555\nparameters and should therefore be assessed on an individual site basis.556\n557\nAcknowledgments558\nThis work was co-funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council559\n(EPSRC) and National Grid.
