The group of endotrivial modules has recently been determined for a finite group\nhaving a normal Sylow p-subgroup. In this paper, we give and compare three different presen-\ntations of a torsion-free subgroup of maximal rank of the group of endotrivial modules. Finally,\nwe illustrate the constructions in an example.\nKeywords : Endotrivial modules, finite groups, cohomology of finite groups.\n1. Introduction\nEndotrivial modules play an important role in the modular representation theory of finite groups,\nand this may explain why many group theorists have been studying them intensively, since the\nlate seventies. The classification of endotrivial modules of a finite p-group was recently achieved\nin [12]. Thereafter, in a joint work, Jon Carlson, Daniel Nakano and the author tackled the question\nof the classification of endotrivial modules for an arbitrary finite group, and they could give an\nalmost complete classification in the case of a finite group of Lie type in its defining characteristic\n(cf. [9]). The general case is still an open question, in the sense that no presentation by generators\nand relations of the group of endotrivial modules is yet known. However, the obstacles have been\novercome in the case of a finite group having a normal Sylow p-subgroup. The results are presented\nin [9, Theorem 3.4], where the authors show that in this case, the group of endotrivial modules\nis generated by the classes of the indecomposable endotrivial modules that are extended from\nthe Sylow p-subgroup. Then, by means of cohomological tools, they construct a minimal set of\ngenerators for the group of endotrivial modules.\nThe primary aim of these notes is to give an alternative construction of a torsion-free subgroup\nof maximal rank of the group of endotrivial modules of a finite group having a normal Sylow p-\nsubgroup, that does not appeal to any cohomological knowledge. The method refers to a theorem\nproven by Dade, and it is presented in Section 3, after that basic facts about endotrivial modules\nare recapitulated in Section 2. In Section 4, we review the modules and the techniques used in [8]\nand [9], and we compare with the approach presented in the previous section. Finally, in Section 5,\nwe work out thoroughly an \u201codd extraspecial\u201d example.\n2. Preliminaries\nThroughout these notes, we let k be an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic p. If\nG is a finite group, we write mod(kG) for the category of finitely generated kG-modules and\nstmod(kG) for the stable module category. That is, the objects of stmod(kG) are the same\nas those of mod(kG), and the morphisms are equivalence classes of morphisms. Namely, two\nmorphisms are equivalent if their difference factors through a projective module (cf. [7, \u00a7 5]). In\naddition, we write k for the 1-dimensional trivial kG-module, and if M is a finitely generated\nkG-module, then EndkM = Homk(M,M) denotes the kG-module that is the k-algebra of k-linear\nendomorphisms of M . Recall that, for two kG-modules M and N , there is an isomorphism of\nkG-modules Homk(M,N) \u223c=M\u2217\u2297N , where M\u2217 = Homk(M,k) is the k-linear dual of M , and the\ntensor product \u201c\u2297\u201d is the tensor product over the field k.\n1\n2 NADIA MAZZA\nDefinition 2.1. Let G be a finite group. A finitely generated kG-module M is endotrivial provided\nthat EndkM \u223c= k in stmod(kG), or equivalently, EndkM \u223c= k \u2295 (proj) in mod(kG), for some\nprojective kG-module (proj).\nWe say that two endotrivial kG-modules are equivalent if they are isomorphic in stmod(kG).\nThe set T (G) of isomorphism classes in stmod(kG) of endotrivial kG-modules is an abelian group,\ncalled the group of endotrivial modules. The composition law is defined by [M ] + [N ] = [M \u2297N ].\nIn particular, in T (G), we have 0 = [k] and \u2212[M ] = [M\u2217].\nEndotrivial kG-modules have been defined by E. Dade (cf. [13]), in 1978, for finite p-groups, as\na particular case of the capped endo-permutation kG-modules. A capped endo-permutation kG-\nmodule, for a finite p-group G, is a finitely generated kG-module whose endomorphism algebra is\na permutation module having a trivial direct summand. Modulo a suitable equivalence relation,\nthey form a finitely generated abelian group D(G), and the group T (G) identifies with a subgroup\nof D(G).\nAlso, for a subgroup H of G, the restriction map ResGH :mod(kG)\u2192mod(kH) (also denoted\nby \u201c\u00b7\u2193GH \u201d) induces a group homomorphism ResGH : T (G)\u2192 T (H).\nNon-trivial examples of endotrivial modules are the syzygies of the trivial module, whereas, in\nthe case of a finite p-group, most of the relative syzygies are capped endo-permutation modules\n(not endotrivial in general, cf. [1]). Let us recall their definitions.\nDefinition 2.2. If X is a finite G-set, then \u21261X(k) is the relative (to X) syzygy of k, that is,\nthe kernel of the augmentation map kX \u2192 k.\nIf X = G, then we define the syzygy \u2126nG(k) of k, for each n \u2208 Z, as follows. If n \u2265 1, we let\n\u2126nG(k) be the kernel of the (n\u2212 1)-st differential in a minimal projective resolution of k.\n. . .\n\u2202n+1 \/\/ Xn\n\u2202n \/\/\n\"\" \"\"F\nFF\nFF\nFF\nF Xn\u22121\n\u2202n\u22121 \/\/ . . . \u22022 \/\/ X1\n\u22021 \/\/\n\"\" \"\"E\nEE\nEE\nEE\nE X0\n\u22020 \/\/ \/\/ k\n\u2126nG(k)\n, \f\n;;vvvvvvvvv\n\u21261G(k)\n- \r\n<<yyyyyyyy\nIf n \u2264 \u22121, we let \u2126nG(k) = Homk(\u2126\u2212nG (k), k), and we set \u21260G(k) = k.\nLet G be a p-group and suppose that \u21261X(k) is a capped endo-permutation kG-module. Then\nwe let \u2126X denote its class in D(G), or T (G) in case it is endotrivial. In particular, for any finite\ngroup G, and for any integer n, the syzygies \u2126nG(k) are indecomposable endotrivial modules and\nwe have [\u2126nG(k)] = n\u2126G in T (G). We refer the reader to Section 4 in [7] for more properties of the\nsyzygies, and to Sections 2 to 5 in [4] for those of the relative syzygies.\nElementary abelian p-subgroups play an important role in the analysis of T (G). In particular,\nwe will need the following group theoretical notions for our purposes.\nDefinition 2.3. Let G be a finite group and p be a prime.\n(1) The p-rank of G is the largest integer r such that G has an elementary abelian p-subgroup\nof rank r.\n(2) We write E\u22652(G) for the poset of G-conjugacy classes of elementary abelian p-subgroups\nof G of p-rank at least 2.\nNote that the p-rank of a finite group G is the p-rank of a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Moreover, if\na Sylow p-subgroup P is normal in G, then E\u22652(G) identifies with the quotient of E\u22652(P ) by the\naction by conjugation of G.\nTHE GROUP OF ENDOTRIVIAL MODULES IN THE NORMAL CASE 3\nThe number of connected components of E\u22652(G) and the torsion-free rank of T (G) are closely\nrelated, as shown by the next two theorems. We state them here as they appear in [12] and in [9]\nrespectively. Let us point out the fact that the first result was first obtained by J. Alperin (cf. [1,\nTheorem 4]).\nLet P be a finite p-group. Assume that P has p-rank at least 2 and is not semi-dihedral. Let\nF1, . . . , Fm denote a set of representatives of the components D1, . . . , Dm of the poset E\u22652(P ).\nBy [12], we know that we can make such a choice satisfying that all Fi\u2019s have p-rank 2, all but\npossibly Fm are maximal, and Fm is normal in P . For each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m let Si be a non-central\nsubgroup of P of order p that is contained in Fi. By [12, Lemma 2.2], if Fi is maximal then\nCP (Si) = Si \u00d7 Li, where Li has normal p-rank one. That is, Li is cyclic if p is odd, and can be\neither cyclic or generalized quaternion in case p = 2.\nTheorem 2.4 ([12], Theorem 3.1). The group T (P ) of endotrivial kP -modules is torsion-free of\nrank m and it is generated by \u2126P and the classes of the modules Ni for i = 1, . . . , (m\u2212 1), where\nNi is the unique indecomposable summand with vertex P of\nM\u22972i if CP (Si)\/Si is cyclic of order \u2265 3,\nMi if p = 2 and |CP (Si)\/Si| = 2,\nM\u22974i if p = 2 and CP (Si)\/Si is generalized quaternion,\nand where Mi = \u2126\u22121P (k)\u2297 \u21261P\/Si(k). Moreover,\nResPFj Ni\n\u223c=\n{\n\u2126aiFi(k)\u2295 (proj) if i = j\nk \u2295 (proj) otherwise\nwhere\nai = \u22122p if CP (Si)\/Si is cyclic of order \u2265 3,\nai = \u22122 if p = 2 and |CP (Si)\/Si| = 2,\nai = \u22128 if p = 2 and CP (Si)\/Si is generalized quaternion.\nIn particular, if T (P ) is cyclic, then T (P ) = \u3008\u2126P \u3009.\nWe refer the reader to [10], [12] and [13] for a detailed description of the group of endotrivial\nmodules in the case that m = 1, since we will not consider that situation later.\nLet G be a finite group having a normal Sylow p-subgroup P , and let F1, . . . , Fm be as above.\nChoose representatives E1, . . . , En of the components C1, . . . , Cn of the poset E\u22652(G).\nRemark 2.5. If P has p-rank at least 3 and m \u2265 2, then, for any index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 1, the\nsubgroups Fi and Fm are not G-conjugate. Indeed, since P is normal in G, then P contains all\np-subgroups of G, and since the p-rank is at least 3, then Fm is contained in an elementary abelian\np-subgroup F of rank 3. Thus, if gF i = Fm < F , for some g \u2208 G, then Fi < F g < P . But\nthis means that Fi is not maximal in P , which implies i = m. In other words, there is only one\nconnected component of elementary abelian p-subgroups of rank at least 3, which is thus invariant\nby any automorphism of P , in particular here by G-conjugation.\nThis observation allows us, without loss of generality and only for the convenience of the no-\ntation, to choose the indexes of the Fi\u2019s so that Ei = Fi, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 and En = Fm. The\nstructure of T (G) is as follows (cf. [9]).\nTheorem 2.6. The group T (G) is finitely generated, and hence, it splits as a direct sum TT (G)\u2295\nTF (G), where TT (G) denotes the torsion subgroup and TF (G) is a torsion-free subgroup of max-\nimal rank (as Z-module).\nMoreover, T (G) is generated by the classes of the indecomposable endotrivial kG-modules whose\nrestriction to P is an indecomposable module, and TF (G) \u223c= Zn.\n4 NADIA MAZZA\nIn particular, if TT (P ) is trivial, then TT (G) is generated by the classes of the one-dimensional\nkG-modules. Also, if n = 1, then TF (G) = \u3008\u2126G\u3009.\nBesides the purpose of the classification of endotrivial kG-modules, the fact that the syzygies\nof k are indecomposable endotrivial modules has the following consequence.\nCorollary 2.7. Let P be a normal Sylow p-subgroup of a finite group G, and let (X., \u2202.) be a\nkG-projective resolution of the trivial module k. Then, (X., \u2202.) is minimal \u21d0\u21d2 (X.\u2193GP , \u2202.\u2193GP ) is\na minimal kP -projective resolution of k.\nProof. \u201c\u21d0=\u201d is obvious.\n\u201c=\u21d2\u201d A projective kG-resolution of k is minimal if and only if it is the splice of short exact\nsequences, one for each integer n \u2265 0,\n0 \/\/ \u2126n+1G (k)\nin \/\/ Xn\n\u2202n \/\/ \u2126nG(k) \/\/ 0\nBy restriction to P , we get then\n0 \/\/ \u2126n+1P (k)\u2295 (proj)\nin\u2193GP \/\/ Xn \u2193GP\n\u2202n\u2193GP \/\/ \u2126nP (k)\u2295 (proj) \/\/ 0\nBut the kG-modules \u2126nG(k) are indecomposable endotrivial and P \/ G, and so, by Theorem 2.6,\n\u2126nG(k)\u2193GP is indecomposable. Therefore the projective factors \u201c(proj)\u201d are all zero. In other words,\nfor each integer n \u2265 0, the above short exact sequence is in fact\n0 \/\/ \u2126n+1P (k)\nin\u2193GP \/\/ Xn \u2193GP\n\u2202n\u2193GP \/\/ \u2126nP (k) \/\/ 0\nHence, (X.\u2193GP , \u2202.\u2193GP ) is a minimal kP -projective resolution of k.\n\u0003\n3. Dade\u2019s result and its consequences\nThroughout this section, we assume that G is a finite group and that P is a normal Sylow\np-subgroup of G. We continue with the notation used in the previous section.\nThe only cases in which generators for the group TF (G) are not given by Theorem 2.6 are for\nTF (G) not cyclic, i.e. for n \u2265 2, according to our notation. Hence, we will assume that n \u2265 2. In\nthis case, we also have m \u2265 2, and so TT (P ) = 0, by Theorem 2.4. Moreover, this also implies\nthat the center of P is cyclic non trivial. Thus, it has a unique cyclic subgroup Z of order p,\nwhich is contained in any maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup. Furthermore, Z \/G, since Z is\ncharacteristic in P .\nA key tool to determine which endotrivial kP -modules extend to G is provided by the following\ntheorem, proven by Dade and never published (as far as we are aware of).\nTheorem 3.1 (Theorem 7.1, [14]). Let G be a finite group having a normal Sylow p-subgroup P , let\nk be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p, and let M be an endo-permutation kP -module.\nThen M extends to a kG-module if and only if M is G-stable.\nBy definition, if H is a normal subgroup of G and M is a kH-module, then we define the\nconjugate kH-module gM ofM by setting h \u00b7 gm\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nin gM\n= g(hg \u00b7m\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nin M\n) , \u2200 h \u2208 H, \u2200 m \u2208M, \u2200 g \u2208 G. We\nsay then that M is G-stable if we have an isomorphism of kH-modules M \u223c= gM, \u2200 g \u2208 G.\nEquivalently, a kH-module M is G-stable if and only if gM \u223c=M, \u2200 g \u2208 G\/H.\nSince an endotrivial module is an endo-permutation module, and since a module is endotrivial\nif and only if its restriction to a Sylow p-subgroup is, we have the following.\nTHE GROUP OF ENDOTRIVIAL MODULES IN THE NORMAL CASE 5\nCorollary 3.2. The map ResGP : T (G) \u2192 T (P ) induces an isomorphism of abelian groups\nTF (G) \u223c= TF (P )G\/P , where TF (P )G\/P is the subset of the G\/P -fixed points. That is, TF (P )G\/P\nis the subgroup of TF (P ) generated by the classes of the G-stable endotrivial kP -modules.\nProof. By Theorem 2.6, we have ker(ResGP ) = TT (G), and the image of Res\nG\nP is necessarily a\nsubgroup of T (P )G\/P . Hence, ResGP induces an injection TF (G) \u2192 TF (P )G\/P . Now, by Theo-\nrem 3.1, an endotrivial kP -module M extends to a kG-module (necessarily endotrivial) if and only\nif M is G-stable. That is, the above map is also surjective.\n\u0003\nAt this stage, determining a set of generators for TF (G) comes down to a question of linear\nalgebra. Indeed, if x \u2208 T (P ) then x is uniquely expressible as a Z-linear combination x =\nm\u2211\ni=1\nxiei,\nwhere ei = [Ni], for the module Ni defined in Theorem 2.4, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m\u2212 1, and em = \u2126P .\nLemma 3.3. For all g \u2208 G, and for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, we have gei = e\u03c3g(i), for the permutation \u03c3g,\nacting on the set {1, . . . ,m}, defined by gSj =P S\u03c3g(j), \u2200 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m\u2212 1 and \u03c3g(m) = m.\nHere, the notation \u201c =P \u201d means \u201cis P -conjugate to\u201d.\nProof. Fix an index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 1, and write S = Si and N = Ni. Let g \u2208 G and consider the\nmap \u03d5 : gk[P\/S] \u2212\u2192 k[P\/gS], defined by \u03d5(g(uS)) = gugS on a k-basis {g(uS) | uS \u2208 P\/S}\nof the permutation kP -module gk[P\/S]. Let us verify that \u03d5 is an isomorphism of kP -modules.\nIt is immediate that \u03d5 is an isomorphism of k-vector spaces, and so we only need to check that \u03d5\ncommutes with the action of P :\nv \u00b7 \u03d5(g(uS)) = v \u00b7 gugS = g(vg u)gS = \u03d5(g(vg uS)) = \u03d5(v \u00b7 g(uS)) , \u2200 u \u2208 P, \u2200 uS \u2208 P\/S, \u2200 g \u2208 G.\nIt follows that we have exact sequences forming the commutative diagram:\n0 \/\/ g \u21261P\/S(k) \/\/\n\u03d5\u2193ker(g\u03b5)\n\u000f\u000f\ngk[P\/S]\ng\u03b5 \/\/\n\u03d5\n\u000f\u000f\ngk \/\/\nId\n\u000f\u000f\n0\n0 \/\/ \u21261P\/gS(k) \/\/ k[P\/gS]\n\u03b5\u2032 \/\/ k \/\/ 0\nSince \u03d5 is an isomorphism, the left hand kP -modules g\u21261P\/S(k) and \u2126\n1\nP\/gS(k) are isomorphic.\nSimilarly, we have g\u21261P (k) \u223c= \u21261P (k) and the result follows.\n\u0003\nThis lemma has an immediate consequence.\nProposition 3.4. x =\nm\u2211\ni=1\nxiei \u2208 T (P )G \u21d0\u21d2 xi = xj whenever Si =G Sj , \u2200 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m\u2212 1.\nWe will need a group theoretical result, complementary to Lemma 2.2 in [12]. For this, let us\nfix an index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 and write S = Si, E = Ei and N = Ni. Recall that our choice of the\nEi\u2019s forces Ei = Fj for some j.\nLemma 3.5. The stabilizer of the P -conjugacy class of S is the subgroup PNG(E) of G.\nProof. By [12, Lemma 2.2], we know that CP (S) = NP (S) = S \u00d7L, where L has normal p-rank 1\nand L contains the unique central subgroup Z of P of order p. Moreover, the index of NP (S) in\nNP (E) is p. In particular, we deduce that E = S \u00d7 Z, and that NP (E)\/NP (S) acts transitively\n(by conjugation) on the p non central subgroups of order p of E.\n6 NADIA MAZZA\nSince Z \/ G, we have NG(S) \u2264 NG(E), and so PNG(S) \u2264 PNG(E).\nConversely, for g \u2208 NG(E), we have gS \u2264 gE = E. Thus, there exists v \u2208 P (actually, we\ncan take v \u2208 NP (E) \u2212 NP (S)) such that gS = vS, and so, v\u22121g \u2208 NG(S). It follows then that\ng \u2208 PNG(S), as was to be shown.\n\u0003\nSince PNG(E) is the stabilizer of the P -conjugacy class of S, Theorem 3.1 implies that N\nextends to a k[PNG(E)]-module N\u02dc , which is necessarily endotrivial.\nLet C be a set of representatives of the left cosets G\/PNG(E). Then the correspondence c 7\u2192 cN\nis a bijection from C to the G-conjugacy class of N .\nDefinition 3.6. Let H be a subgroup of G and let M be a kH-module. We define the tensor\ninduced module TenGH M as follows (cf. [15, \u00a7 5.1]). It is the k-vector space\u2297\ns\u2208[G\/H]\n(\ns\u2297M) , where [G\/H] is a set of representatives of the left cosets G\/H\nendowed with the structure of kG-module given by\ng \u00b7 \u2297s(s\u2297ms) = \u2297s(\u03c4g(s)\u2297 hsms) = \u2297s(s\u2297 h\u03c4\u22121g (s)m\u03c4\u22121g (s)) ,\nwhere gs = \u03c4g(s)hs, with hs \u2208 H and a permutation \u03c4g of [G\/H].\nProposition 3.7. The kG-module TenGPNG(E) N\u02dc is endotrivial.\nProof. It is enough to check that ResGP Ten\nG\nPNG(E) N\u02dc is endotrivial. By the tensor version of Mackey\nformula (cf. [15, Prop. 5.2.1]), and since P \/ G, we have isomorphisms of kP -modules\nResGP Ten\nG\nPNG(E) N\u02dc\n\u223c=\n\u2297\nc\u2208C\nTenPP\u2229c(PNG(E))Res\nc(PNG(E))\nP\u2229c(PNG(E))\ncN\u02dc =\n=\n\u2297\nc\u2208C\nRes\nc(PNG(E))\nP\ncN\u02dc \u223c=\n\u2297\nc\u2208C\nc\n(\nResPNG(E)P N\u02dc\n) \u223c=\u2297\nc\u2208C\ncN\nwhich is a tensor product of endotrivial kP -modules and hence is endotrivial.\n\u0003\nFor any elementary abelian p-group E of rank at least 2, we may identify the group T (E) = \u3008\u2126E\u3009\nwith Z, via n\u2126E 7\u2192 n.\nDefinition 3.8. Let H be a finite group and let E1, . . . , El be representatives of the connected\ncomponents of E\u22652(H). The product of all restriction maps ResHEi : T (H) \u2212\u2192 T (Ei), composed\nwith the isomorphism T (Ei) \u223c= Z, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, yields a well-defined homomorphism\nresE(H) : T (H) \/\/\n\u220fl\ni=1T (Ei)\n\/\/ Zl\nFor any endotrivial kH-module M , the element resE(H)([M ]) \u2208 Zl is called the type of M .\nThroughout these notes, \u03b4i,j denotes the Kronecker symbol.\nProposition 3.9. We have ker(resE(G)) = TT (G). Moreover,\nresE(G)([Ten\nG\nPNG(Ej) N\u02dcj ]) = (\u03b4i,jai)\nn\ni=1 ,\nwhere ai is the integer defined in Theorem 2.4.\nTHE GROUP OF ENDOTRIVIAL MODULES IN THE NORMAL CASE 7\nProof. The first statement has been proved in [9, Proposition 2.3], so we only need to show the\nsecond one.\nBy transitivity of the restriction and Proposition 3.7, we have\nResGEi Ten\nG\nPNG(Ej) N\u02dcj\n\u223c=\n\u2297\nc\u2208Cj\nResPEi\ncN j\nwhere Cj is a set of representatives of the left cosets G\/PNG(Ej). We may assume that 1 \u2208 Cj for\nall j. Now, for any c \u2208 Cj , the kP -module cN j is endotrivial and defined in Theorem 2.4 as the\n\u201cunique\u201d indecomposable direct summand with vertex P of a r-fold tensor product of the module\nc\n(\n\u2126\u22121P (k)\u2297 \u21261P\/Sj (k)\n) \u223c= \u2126\u22121P (k)\u2297 \u21261P\/cSj (k)\nwhere the integer r is either 1, 2 or 4. By \u201cunique\u201d, we mean unique up to isomorphism.\nEven though it is not an endotrivial module, ResPEi \u2126\n1\nP\/cSj\n(k) has a \u201cunique\u201d indecomposable\nsummand V with vertex Ei, and V is isomorphic to \u21261(P\/cSj)\u2193PEi\n(k). By Mackey formula (for\nEi-sets) we have that\n(P\/cSj) \u2193PEi \u223c=\n\u2210\nx\u2208[Ei\\P\/cSj ]\nEi\/\n(\nEi \u2229 xcSj\n)\nIf i 6= j then Ej 6=G Ei and no G-conjugate of Sj is contained in Ei, since Ei = Si \u00d7 Z and\nZ \/ G. It follows that\n(P\/cSj)\u2193PEi \u223c=\n\u2210\nx\u2208[Ei\\P\/cSj ]\nEi . Thus, V \u223c= \u21261Ei(k) if i 6= j, by [4, Lemma 3.2.7],\nand therefore cN j is trivial.\nOtherwise, we have i = j. If xcSi < Ei, for x \u2208 P , then there is y \u2208 NP (Ei)\u2212CP (Si) such that\nxcSi = ySi, since NP (Ei)\/CP (Si) acts transitively on the p non central subgroups of order p of Ei.\nIt follows that y\u22121xc \u2208 NG(Si), and so c \u2208 PNG(Si) = PNG(Ei). By the choice of representatives\nin Ci, this implies c = 1. Then, Theorem 2.4 shows that ResPEi Ni\n\u223c= \u2126aiEi \u2295 (proj).\nFinally, if i = j and c 6\u2208 PNG(Ei), then the previous argument shows that xcSi is not contained\nin Ei, for any x \u2208 P . Therefore, ResPEi cN i \u223c= k \u2295 (proj), as in the case i 6= j.\nIn conclusion, by tensoring all the pieces together, we deduce that\nResGEi Ten\nG\nPNG(Ej) N\u02dcj\n\u223c=\n\u2297\nc\u2208Cj\nResPEi\ncN j \u223c=\n{\n\u2126aiEi(k)\u2295 (proj) if i = j\nk \u2295 (proj) if i 6= j\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.10. Let G be a finite group having a normal Sylow p-subgroup P . Consider the\nsame notation as above, and write the group T (G) of endotrivial kG-modules as a direct sum\nT (G) = TT (G)\u2295 TF (G), where TT (G) is the torsion subgroup and TF (G) is torsion-free. Then,\nwe may choose the set{\n\u2126G, xi = [TenGPNG(Ei) N\u02dci] | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1\n}\nas a basis for the free Z-module TF (G).\nMoreover, we have resE(G)(\u2126G) = (1)ni=1, and resE(G)(xj) = (\u03b4i,jai)\nn\ni=1.\nProof. The kG-modules TenGPNG(Ei) N\u02dci are endotrivial and their classes are linearly independent,\nby Theorem 2.4 and the proof of Proposition 3.7. Hence they generate a torsion-free submodule\nof T (G) of rank equal to the rank of TF (G).\nMoreover, the proof of Proposition 3.7 shows that in T (P ) we have\nResGP [Ten\nG\nPNG(Ei) N\u02dci] =\n\u2211\nc\u2208Ci\n[cN i]\n8 NADIA MAZZA\nwhere Ci denotes a set of the representatives of the left cosets G\/PNG(Ei). Since {cN i | c \u2208 Ci} is\na sequence without repetition that contains all the G-conjugates of Ni, it also makes the element\u2211\nc\u2208Ci\n[cN i] of T (P ) satisfy the minimal necessary condition for being G-stable, by Proposition 3.4.\nThis proves the first statement. The second claim has been proved in Proposition 3.9.\n\u0003\n4. Alternative constructions\nThroughout this section, we let G be a finite group having a normal Sylow p-subgroup P . We\nassume n \u2265 2, and we choose the representatives E1, . . . , En and F1, . . . , Fm of the connected\ncomponents of E\u22652(G) and E\u22652(P ), respectively, such that Ei = Fi, \u2200 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121 and En = Fm,\nas before. Write also Z = \u3008z\u3009 for the unique central subgroup of P of order p. Finally, let ai be\nthe integer defined in Theorem 2.4.\nThe purpose of this section is to review the two constructions of endotrivial modules providing\nfree sets of generators for TF (G), as given in [9]. Then, we compare the modules obtained for\neach construction. We assume that the reader is familiar with the notions of cohomology of finite\ngroups and (cohomological) varieties of modules given in [7] or [15]. The notation we use in this\nsection is as follows. For an inclusion of finite groups H \u2192 K, we denote the induced restriction\nmap in cohomology H\u2217(K, k)\u2192 H\u2217(H, k) either ResKH or \u2193KH indifferently. Meanwhile, we denote\nby res\u2217K,H : VH(k)\u2192 VK(k) the induced map on the varieties.\nLet us now recall the presentation of TF (G) given in [9].\nTheorem 4.1 ([9, Theorem 3.4]). For each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 there exists an endotrivial kG-module\nUi such that\nUi \u2193GEi \u223c= \u2126aiEi \u2295 (proj) and Ui \u2193GEj \u223c= k \u2295 (proj) , \u2200 j 6= i ,\nwhere the ai\u2019s are the integers defined in Theorem 2.4.\nThe classes \u2126G, [Ui], 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1 form a free set of generators for TF (G).\nThe structure of the modules Ui is described in the proof, which uses the construction originat-\ning from [11] and quoted by the authors as the \u201cdeconstruction method\u201d. Briefly, it consists in\nanalysing the variety V = VG\/Z(\u2126\nai\nG (k)), where \u2126\nai\nG (k) is the kG\/Z-module that is the quotient\nof \u2126aiG (k) by the submodule (z \u2212 1)p\u22121\u2126aiG (k). The arguments of [8, Theorem 7.2] show that for\neach index j, the variety V decomposes as a union of varieties Vj \u222a V \u2032j such that\nVj \u2229 V \u2032j = {0} , Vj = res\u2217G\/Z,Ej\/Z(VEj\/Z(k)) and res\u2217G\/Z,El\/Z(VEl\/Z(k)) \u2286 V \u2032j , \u2200 l 6= j\nThen, by [8, Corollary 4.3], there exists an endotrivial module of the desired type, whose construc-\ntion appeals to previous results (and ultimately from a theorem of [2], applied to the Lyndon-\nHochschild-Serre spectral sequence of the group extension 1 \u2192 Z \u2192 G \u2192 G\/Z \u2192 1). Indeed, it\nturns out that each Vj is the variety of the kG\/Z-module that is the quotient Uj\/(z \u2212 1)p\u22121Uj of\nan indecomposable endotrivial kG-module Uj .\nWe now turn to the third construction. Note that it does not require P \/ G, and that, instead,\nit necessites an additional assumption on the cohomology group H\u2217(G, k).\nProposition 4.2 ([8, Corollary 4.6]). Suppose that Z is a subgroup of order p in the center of a\nSylow p-subgroup P of G. Suppose that for d > 0 the group H2d(G, k) has an element \u03b6 such that\nResGZ (\u03b6) 6= 0. Then G has an endotrivial module of type (2d\u03b4i,j)ni=1 for each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\nLet us recall how these endotrivial modules are obtained, starting from a generalization of the\ndefinition of Carlson\u2019s L\u03b6 \u2019s modules (cf. [7, \u00a7 6]).\nTHE GROUP OF ENDOTRIVIAL MODULES IN THE NORMAL CASE 9\nDefinition 4.3. Let \u03b6 \u2208 Hs(G,S) be non zero, where S is a 1-dimensional kG-module and s \u2265 1.\nLet \u03b6\u02dc \u2208 HomG(\u2126sG(k), S) represent \u03b6. We define the kG-module L\u03b6,S = ker \u03b6\u02dc.\nAmong many properties of these modules, all that we need to know for our concern is that the\nmodules L\u03b6,S are defined up to isomorphism by the class \u03b6 \u2208 Hs(G,S). In particular, for s = 2d,\nas in Proposition 4.2, we have a short exact sequence of kG-modules\n0 \/\/ L\u03b6,S \/\/ \u21262dG (k)\n\u03b6\u02dc \/\/ S \/\/ 0\nwhich does not depend on the choice of \u03b6\u02dc, and which does not involve any projective summand.\nSince \u21262dZ (k) = k, we have that \u2126\n2d\nG (k)\u2193GZ \u223c= k\u2295(proj). Thus, the assumption that \u03b6 \u2193GZ 6= 0 implies\nthat L\u03b6,S \u2193GZ is projective. By Quillen Dimension Theorem (cf. [15, Corollary 8.3.3]), it follows\nthat the variety VG(L\u03b6,S) of L\u03b6,S is disconnected, since the number n of connected components of\nE\u22652(G) is at least 2. More precisely, VG(L\u03b6,S) is a union of n subspaces V1, . . . , Vn, each Vi being\nthe variety of a kG-submodule Li of L\u03b6,S , such that L\u03b6,S decomposes as direct sum L1\u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Ln.\nNote that Vi is a line for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1. The similar reasoning applies to the group P\ninstead of G, and since \u2126G(k) \u2193GP \u223c= \u2126P (k), we conclude that L\u03b6,S \u2193GP \u223c= L\u03b6\u2193GP splits as a direct\nsum X1\u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295Xm, where m \u2265 2 is the number of connected components of E\u22652(P ). Moreover, if\nVP (L\u03b6,S \u2193GP ) = W1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222aWm, with Wi = VP (Xi), then G acts by permutation on the Wi\u2019s and\nhence on the Xi\u2019s. It follows that Li \u2193GP \u223c= \u2295g\u2208[G\/Gi] g \u00b7Xi, for the stabilizer Gi = PNG(Fi) of the\nP -conjugacy class of Fi, as in the previous section.\nFor each index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, set L\u2032i = \u2295j\u2208JiLj , where Ji = {j | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, i 6= j}.\nProposition 4.4. Each Li gives rise to an indecomposable endotrivial kG-module Mi, of type\n(2d\u03b4i,j)nj=1, built as the push-out in the following commutative diagram.\n0\n\u000f\u000f\n0\n\u000f\u000f\nL\u2032i\n\u000f\u000f\nL\u2032i\n\u000f\u000f\n0 \/\/ L\u03b6,S \/\/\n\u000f\u000f\n\u21262dG (k)\n\u03b6\u02dc \/\/\n\u000f\u000f\nS \/\/ 0\n0 \/\/ Li \/\/\n\u000f\u000f\nMi \/\/\n\u000f\u000f\nS \/\/ 0\n0 0\nProof. The proof is a paraphrase of an argument used in the demonstration of [9, Theorem 3.1],\nand goes as follows.\nLet 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n. We need to show that\nMi \u2193GEj \u223c=\n{\n\u21262dEj (k)\u2295 (proj) if i = j\nk \u2295 (proj) otherwise\nWe have Li \u2193GP = \u2295g\u2208[G\/Gi] g \u00b7Xi, with Xi \u2193PEj projective (and hence injective) if and only if\nj 6= i, i.e. Ej 6= Fi, by our choice of the representatives of the connected components of E\u22652(P ) and\nE\u22652(G). This implies that exactly one of the restrictions to Ej of the exact sequences consisting\n10 NADIA MAZZA\nin the second column or the bottom row is split, depending on whether Xj is a summand in Li \u2193GP\nor not. Namely, the restriction to Ej of the second column splits if and only if Xj | Li \u2193GP , that is,\nif and only if Xj = g \u00b7Xi, for some g \u2208 G. This happens if and only if i = j, and in this case we\nhave\nMj \u2193GEj \u2295(proj) \u223c= \u21262dP (k)\u2193PEj \u223c= \u21262dEj (k)\u2295 (proj).\nHence Mj \u2193GEj \u223c= \u21262dEj (k)\u2295 (proj).\nOtherwise, i 6= j and the restriction to Ej of the bottom row splits, since the left term is\ninjective. In this case, we have Mi \u2193GEj \u223c= k \u2295 (proj).\nThus Mi \u2193GEj is endotrivial for all 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, and the type of Mi is (2d\u03b4i,j)ni=1, as asserted.\n\u0003\nWe discuss the possible additional assumptions needed for this construction to be carried out.\nThat is, we want to give a sufficient and necessary condition on the cohomology group H2d(P, k),\nthat would detect when there exists a one-dimensional kG-module S such that H2d(G,S) contains\nan element that restrict non trivially to Z.\nLetH be a normal subgroup ofG. Then HomH(M \u2193GH , k) is a kG-module, for any kG-moduleM ,\nand since the restriction map commutes with the differentials in complexes of kG- and kH-modules,\nit induces a map of kG-modules ResGH : H\ns(G, k) \u2212\u2192 Hs(H, k) in cohomology (cf. [15, \u00a7 4.1]). In\nfact,H acts trivially on HomH(M \u2193GH , k), and so, we can consider ResGH as a map of kG\/H-modules.\nSimilarly, for G, P, Z and 2d as in Proposition 4.2, the map ResPZ : H\n2d(P, k) \u2212\u2192 H2d(Z, k) is\na map of kG\/P -modules. Since p does not divide the order of G\/P , the map ResPZ splits. Now,\nthe fact that H2d(Z, k) is one dimensional implies that, if ResPZ is non zero, then any non zero\nelement \u03b2 \u2208 H2d(Z, k) lifts to an element \u03b6 \u2208 H2d(P, k) that restricts non trivially to Z and such\nthat (g \u00b7 \u03b6)\u2193PZ = g \u00b7 \u03b6 \u2193PZ = \u00b5g\u03b2, for some |G : P |-root of unity \u00b5g \u2208 k, for any g \u2208 G.\nOn the other hand, we also have that the action of G on the 1-dimensional k-vector space\nHs(Z, k), for any integer s \u2265 0, defines a representation \u03c1 : G \u2192 Aut(Hs(Z, k)) of G. Set H for\nthe kernel of \u03c1, that is, H = {g \u2208 G | g \u00b7 \u03b6 = \u03b6 , \u2200 \u03b6 \u2208 Hs(Z, k)} is the stabilizer of Hs(Z, k) in G.\nIn particular, H is a normal subgroup of G containing P , and the quotient group G\/H is cyclic\nof order prime to p, since it is isomorphic to a finite subgroup of the group of units in k. Hence,\nHs(Z, k) is a kG\/H-module.\nLemma 4.5. Let s \u2265 0 be an integer and assume there exists \u03b6 \u2208 Hs(P, k), such that \u03b6 \u2193PZ 6= 0.\nThen TrHP \u03b6 \u2208 Hs(H, k) and we have (TrHP \u03b6)\u2193HZ 6= 0, where TrHP denotes the transfer in cohomology\n( cf. [15, \u00a7 4.2]).\nProof. Let \u03b6 \u2208 Hs(P, k), for some s \u2265 0, and assume that \u03b6 \u2193PZ 6= 0. By definition of H, we have\nResHZ Tr\nH\nP \u03b6 =\n\u2211\ng\u2208[H\/P ]\ng \u00b7 \u03b6 \u2193PZ = |H : P | \u00b7 \u03b6 \u2193PZ .\nSince |H : P | is invertible in k, we have that ResHZ TrHP \u03b6 6= 0 if \u03b6 \u2193PZ 6= 0.\n\u0003\nThis observation leads us to a sufficient and necessary condition for determining when the last\nconstruction of endotrivial modules can be applied, provided that it applies for T (P ).\nProposition 4.6. There exist a 1-dimensional kG-module S and \u03b7 \u2208 Hs(G,S) such that \u03b7\u2193GZ 6= 0\nif and only if there exists \u03b6 \u2208 Hs(P, k) such that \u03b6 \u2193PZ 6= 0.\nIn particular, for s = 2d, there exists then an indecomposable endotrivial module of type\n(2d\u03b4i,j)ni=1, for each index 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\nTHE GROUP OF ENDOTRIVIAL MODULES IN THE NORMAL CASE 11\nProof. The \u201cif \u201d part is clear.\nAssume there exists \u03b6 \u2208 Hs(P, k) such that \u03b6 \u2193PZ 6= 0, and let H be the stabilizer of Hs(Z, k)\nin G, as above. By Lemma 4.5, we have that TrHP \u03b6 \u2208 Hs(H, k) and that (TrHP \u03b6)\u2193HZ 6= 0. By the\nEckmann-Shapiro Lemma (cf. [15, Proposition 4.1.3]), we have Hs(H, k) \u223c= Hs(G, k\u2191GH). Thus, the\nimage of TrHP \u03b6 under this isomorphism is an element of H\ns(G, k\u2191GH) that restricts non trivially to\nthe subgroup Z. Now, k\u2191GH is a direct sum of 1-dimensional kG-modules, since G\/H is a cyclic\ngroup of order prime to p, as noted above, and since k is algebraically closed. Therefore, there is a\n1-dimensional direct summand S of k\u2191GH and \u03b7 \u2208 Hs(G,S) such that \u03b7\u2193GZ 6= 0, as was to be shown.\nThe last assertion is then the application of Proposition 4.2.\n\u0003\nWe end this section with the comparison of the modules obtained in each construction, and, for\nconvenience, we use the same notation. First, observe that a module TenGGi N\u02dci of Section 3 is not\nindecomposable and it has a large dimension, in general. Moreover the corresponding kP -module\nNi is the cap of a (larger, in general) endo-permutation module. That is, Ni is the unique direct\nsummand with vertex P of a capped endo-permutation kP -module. Consequently, if one wishes to\ncompute T (G) with a computer support, the generators for TF (G) provided by the TenGGi N\u02dci are\nlikely to involve time-consuming algorithms. Instead, the modules of Section 4 are indecomposable\nand their construction is likely to be more handy by an algebra software.\nIn order to compare the three presentations of TF (G), we use the injectivity of the restriction\nmap resE(G) : TF (G)\u2192\n\u220fn\ni=1 T (Ei). Then, it is the simple matter of comparing the computations\nin Theorems 3.10, 4.1, and Proposition 4.2.\nRemark 4.7. In stmod(kG), we have isomorphisms TenGGi N\u02dci\n\u223c= U\u2217i \u223c= M\u2217i , \u2200 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. In\nparticular, since Ui and Mi are indecomposable, we have Ui \u223c=Mi in mod(kG), for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nIt is remarkable, and remains yet unexplained, that the modules Ui andMi are isomorphic, since\ntheir construction is apparently different. Moreover, the modules Mi cannot be built in general,\nwhereas the modules Ui always exist.\n5. Odd extraspecial example\nLet p be an odd prime and let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of PSL3(p). That is, P is an extraspecial\np-group of order p3 and exponent p. Let G be its normalizer in PSL3(p).\nThere are p+1 conjugacy classes in P of maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of rank 2, each\nconsisting of a single maximal normal subgroup of P . Let us call these subgroups F1, . . . , Fp+1.\nChoose also non central subgroups Si < Fi, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 (p+ 1) of order p.\nBy Theorem 2.4, the group T (P ) of endotrivial modules is free abelian of rank p+1 and admits\na presentation T (P ) = \u3008\u2126P , [Ni], 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p\u3009, where [Ni] denotes the class of the indecomposable\nendotrivial summand of the kP -module\n(\n\u2126\u22121P (k) \u2297 \u21261P\/Si(k)\n)\u22972, for each index i. The elements\n[Ni], for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p+ 1, verify a non trivial relation in T (P ) (cf. also [5, \u00a7 11])\np+1\u2211\ni=1\n[Ni] = 2p \u2126P , since both have the same type, namely (2p, . . . , 2p) \u2208 Zp+1.\nLet us also point out that, for each index i, the module\n(\n\u2126\u22121P (k)\u2297 \u21261P\/Si(k)\n)\u22972 is not endotrivial\n(and hence it is decomposable). Indeed, it has dimension (p3\u22121)2(p2\u22121)2, which is not congruent\nto \u00b11( mod p3), \u2200 p > 2.\nLet us now consider T (G). By Theorem 2.6, the torsion subgroup TT (G) is generated by the\none-dimensional kG-modules, since TT (P ) is trivial. That is, TT (G) is isomorphic to the character\n12 NADIA MAZZA\ngroup of the abelian p\u2032-group G\/P \u223c= Cp\u22121 \u00d7 Cp\u22121. On the other hand, for TF (G), we note that\nthere are exactly two elementary abelian p-subgroups which are normal in G, and the p\u2212 1 others\nform a unique G-conjugacy class. Say F1, F2 \/ G, and F3 =G \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 =G Fp+1. Then, we may\nchoose Ei = Fi, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, and so we get G1 = G2 = G and G3 has index p \u2212 1 in G, where\nGi = PNG(Ei) = NG(Ei) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3. Indeed, by the Class Formula, the cardinality of the\nG-orbit of E3 is p\u2212 1, which is hence the index in G of the stabilizer PNG(E3) of the G-conjugacy\nclass of E3.\nFrom Proposition 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, we get T (P )G\/P = \u3008\u2126P , [N1], [N2]\u3009 \u223c= Z3. Note also\nthat\np+1\u2211\ni=3\n[Ni] = \u2212[N1]\u2212 [N2] \u2208 T (P )G\/P .\nTheorem 3.1 implies that the modules N1 and N2 extend to G, into indecomposable endotrivial\nmodules N\u02dc1 and N\u02dc2, respectively. Therefore, TF (G) = \u3008\u2126P , [N\u02dc1], [N\u02dc2]\u3009, by Theorem 3.10.\nBy Proposition 3.7, the module N3 extends to an indecomposable endotrivial kG3-module N\u02dc3,\nyielding then an endotrivial kG-module TenGG3 N\u02dc3. Moreover, [Ten\nG\nG3 N\u02dc3] + [N\u02dc1] + [N\u02dc2] \u2208 TT (G).\nLastly, we remark that in the presentation of TF (G) above, the underlying modules are inde-\ncomposable, which is not the case in general. But it need to be pointed out that the modules Ni\nare proper direct summands of (endo-permutation) modules of dimension (p3 \u2212 1)2(p2 \u2212 1)2, and\nthat at this point we do not know what Dim(Ni) is. The second half of this section will give us\nthe answer.\nWe turn now to the presentation of T (P ) and TF (G) described in Section 4, and for convenience,\nwe adopt the same notation. In particular, since p is odd, we have ai = 2p, for the integer ai of\nTheorem 2.4. Hence, we can apply Proposition 4.2 to find generators for T (P ). Indeed, by [3,\nTheorem 10.1] (or [16, Theorems 6 and 7]), there exists \u03b6 \u2208 H2p(P, k) such that \u03b6 \u2193PZ 6= 0. In fact,\n\u03b6 \u2208 H2p(P,Fp) and \u03b6 is obtained as the norm from any F \u2208 E\u22652(P ) to P of the inflation of a non\nzero element \u03b7 \u2208 H2(Z,Fp), and where Z is identified with a quotient of F .\nLet \u03b6\u02dc : \u21262pP (k)\u2192 k represent \u03b6 and set L\u03b6 = ker \u03b6\u02dc. Then L\u03b6 is the direct sum L1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Lp+1\nof indecomposable kP -modules. Moreover, all the modules Li have same dimension, since the\nautomorphism group Aut(P ) of P permutes transitively the subgroups F1, . . . , Fp+1 and hence\nAut(P ) also acts by permuting transitively the Li\u2019s.\nNow, the endotrivial modules Mi, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p+ 1, are obtained as the push-out\nL\u03b6 \/\/\n\u000f\u000f\n\u21262pP (k)\n\u000f\u000f\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\nLi \/\/____ Mi .\nIn addition, by [11, Corollary 4.4], we have Dim(\u21262pP (k)) = p\n3(p + 1) + 1. Therefore, we get\nDim(Li) = p3, and so Dim(Mi) = p3 + 1. Note that this is the minimal possible dimension that\nwe could expect for Mi. Indeed, it has to be greater than 1 and congruent to 1 ( mod |P |).\nLast but not least, we handle TF (G). Note that since H2p(P, k) contains an element that\nrestricts non trivially to Z, we can apply any of the two constructions presented in Section 4. We\nchoose the \u201cdeconstruction method\u201d (cf. Theorem 4.1).\nWe consider the kG\/Z-module\nU = \u21262pG (k)\n\/\n(z \u2212 1)p\u22121\u21262pG (k) .\nNote that the action of (z\u22121)p\u22121 =\u2211p\u22121i=0 zi on a kZ-moduleM annihilates any non-free summand\nof M , and sends a free module onto its socle. By a dimension argument (cf. [11, Corollary 4.4]),\nTHE GROUP OF ENDOTRIVIAL MODULES IN THE NORMAL CASE 13\nwe deduce that \u21262pG (k)\u2193GZ \u223c= k \u2295 (kZ)p\n2(p+1), and so (z \u2212 1)p\u22121\u21262pG (k) has dimension p2(p+ 1). It\nfollows that Dim(U) = p2(p+ 1)(p\u2212 1) + 1.\nIn addition, in the notation of the discussion after Theorem 4.1, the variety V = VG\/Z(U)\ndecomposes as the union V1 \u222a V2 \u222a V3 \u222aW , where W = V \u20321 \u2229 V \u20322 \u2229 V \u20323 . This is because E\u22652(G)\nconsists in three isolated vertices E1, E2, E3. Then, each Vi is the variety of the kG\/Z-module\nU\u00afi = Ui\/(z \u2212 1)p\u22121Ui, for an indecomposable endotrivial kG-module Ui satisfying\nUi \u2193GEj =\n{\n\u21262pEi(k)\u2295 (proj) if i = j\nk \u2295 (proj) if i 6= j\nSince the group Aut(G) of automorphisms of G permutes transitively E1, E2 and E3, the induced\naction on V permutes transitively V1, V2 and V3. Consequently, the modules U\u00af1, U\u00af2 and U\u00af3\nhave same dimension. Since the Ui\u2019s are endotrivial, we have Ui \u2193GZ = k \u2295 (proj). It follows that\nDim(Ui) = 1 + pDim(U\u00afi), for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, and thus the modules Ui have same dimension.\nNow, Ei = Fi, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, and E3 =G Fi , \u2200 3 \u2264 i \u2264 p + 1. That is, the G-conjugacy\nclasses of F1 and F2 coincide with their respective P -conjugacy classes. Therefore, U1 \u2193GP and\nU2 \u2193GP are isomorphic to the indecomposable endotrivial modules obtained using the techniques\nof Theorem 4.1 applied to P instead of G, and corresponding to F1 and F2 respectively. By\nRemark 4.7, we have Ui \u2193GP \u223c= Mi for i = 1, 2. Thus, Dim(Ui) = p3 + 1 and Dim(U\u00afi) = p2,\nfor i = 1, 2 and 3. Note also that the isomorphism U3 \u2193GP \u2295 (proj) \u223c= \u2297p+1i=3Mi tells us that\nDim((proj)) = (p3 + 1)p\u22121 \u2212 (p3 + 1). On the other hand, the variety W is the variety of a\nkG\/Z-module of dimension Dim(U)\u2212 3Dim(U\u00af1) = p2((p+ 1)(p\u2212 1)\u2212 3) + 1.\nWe can now answer the question concerning the dimension of the modules N\u02dc1, N\u02dc2 and TenGG3 N\u02dc3.\nIndeed, by duality and indecomposability, we have Dim(N\u02dci) = p3 + 1 for i = 1, 2, whereas\nDim(TenGG3 N\u02dc3) = (p\n3 + 1)p\u22121.\nIn particular, TenGG3 N\u02dc3 is not indecomposable, since\nDim(M3) = (p\u2212 1)p3 + 1 < (p3 + 1)p\u22121 = Dim(TenGG3 N\u02dc3), \u2200 p > 2 .\nMore precisely, we have TenGG3 N\u02dc3\n\u223c=M\u22173 \u2295 (proj), where\nDim((proj)) = Dim(TenGG3 N\u02dc3)\u2212Dim(M3) =\np\u22121\u2211\ni=2\n(\np\u2212 1\ni\n)\np3i.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank in a special way Jon Carlson for sharing his deep knowledge of\nthe topic.
