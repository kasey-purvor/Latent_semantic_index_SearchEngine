Introduction\nDevelopment of biosensors for detection of various toxic compounds in both environment and \nfood stuffs is one of the most promising areas of modern biotechnology [1\u20133]. Biosensors are \nable to provide highly-sensitive, selective, and reliable analysis of toxic molecules. Normally \nthey are characterized by simplicity of operation, low cost, and compactness. One of the \ngeneral drawbacks of biosensor analysis is the low stability of biomolecules in extreme \nenvironments and, therefore, necessity of stabilization of bioselective elements of biosensors. \nFrom this point of view, substitution of biomolecules by their synthetic counterparts \n(molecularly-imprinted polymers) is very attractive [4]. Molecularly-imprinted polymers\nPage 2 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n2\n(MIPs) are widely used as stationary phases for chromatography and solid-phase extraction \n[5-6] as well as substitutes of antibodies in immunoassays and biosensors [7-11]. \nSynthesis of enzyme mimicks able to selective cleavage of analytes of interest using the \nmethod of molecular imprinting is of great importance for biosensor technology [12-20]. To \ndate the possibilities of synthesis of molecularly-imprinted polymers able to catalytic \ncleavage of esters [21-24], p-aminophenol [25-26],  glutathione [27],  nitrophenols [28] as \nwell as catalytic hydrolysis of carbonates and carbamates [14, 29, 30] and have been \ndemonstrated. During the recent years new formats for MIPs attract significant interest. \nApplication of molecularly imprinted polymer membranes in biosensor technology is \nbecoming increasingly attractive as compared to traditional MIP particles synthesized either \nby bulk, suspension or precipitation polymerization [31-32]. \nThe aim of the present research is synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymer membranes \nmimicking natural enzyme tyrosinase, development of biosensors for phenols detection on \ntheir basis, as well as optimization of their working parameters.\nThere are a number of traditional methods of phenols\u2019 detection in the environment and food \nstuffs. Instrumental analytical methods (GC-MS [33], HPLC [34-37], capillary \nelectrophoresis [38],  capillary electrochromatography [39],  thin-layer chromatography [40, \n41] are widely used for routine detection of phenols. As the more effective alternative to the \nabove-mentioned methods, a number of highly-sensitive biosensor devices based on the \nimmobilized mushroom tyrosinase [42-44] and horseradish peroxidase [45], providing the \npossibility of phenols detection in micromolar range with detection limits for different \nphenolic compounds 1- 25 \uf06dM have been developed. However, stability of biosensors during \nprolonged storage is insufficient for wide practical application, while necessity of either \nenzyme stabilization or application of highly stable enzyme mimics is obvious [46, 47].\n2.

Synthesis of urocanic acid ethyl ester.\nEthanol was dried over CaO and distilled prior to use. HCl vapours were obtained by slow \naddition of concentrated HCl to concentrated \u041d2SO4 with further bubbling through \nconcentrated \u041d2SO4. \u041a2\u0421\u041e3 was dried before use by incineration.\nEsterification, production of urocanic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride: \n0.1 M of urocanic acid were mixed with 4M of ethanol in a reactor with a stirring rod,\nbackflow condenser, and gas-intake pipe. The mixture was saturated with HCl vapors up to \npH=1-2 during the mixing and cooling procedure. The mixture was heated up to boiling. That \nwas followed by mixing until the sediment is dissolved (typically for 3 hours).  The backflow \ncondenser was changed for a descending one and ethanol (~100 g) was slowly distilled off for\n2.5 hours until appearance of the sediment. The distillation was stopped, the reaction mixture \nwas cooled down to the room temperature. Under these conditions precipitation of urocanic \nacid ethyl ester hydrochloride occurred.   \nThe sediment was filtered, washed with ethanol, dried at room temperature. The urocanic acid \nethyl ester hydrochloride (white crystals with the melting point ~ 202-207\uf0b0\u0421) was obtained.  \nThe reactions take place according to the following schemes: \nPage 3 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3\nN\nN\nHC\nH\nCHCOOH\n+ HCl\nN\nN\nHC\nH\nCHCOOH\n+\nHCl\n_\nC2H5OH+\nH2O- N\nN\nHC\nH\nCHCOOC2H5\n+\nHCl\n_\nAfter re-crystallization from ethanol, the melting point of urocanic acid ethyl ester\nhydrochloride  comprised 205-206\uf0b0\u0421. \nIsolation of urocanic acid ethyl ester from its hydrochloride. The reactor with a stirring rod,\ndropping funnel, and gas-intake pipe was used for the synthesis. 0.1 M of urocanic ethyl ester \nhydrochloride was placed in the rector and dissolved in 50 ml distilled water. The dropping \nfunnel was filled with aqueous \u041a2\u0421\u041e3 solution and this solution was slowly added to the \nurocanic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride solution in the reactor during cooling on water bath \nunder constant stirring.

Monomer mixture for the synthesis of catalytic molecularly-imprinted polymer \nmembranes contained 0.0069 g catechol, 0.0619 g urocanic acid ethyl ester, 0.134 g \nCuCl2\u00b72H2O, 1.25 g dimethylformamide, 1.2012 g mixture of \ntri(ethyleneglycol)dimethacrylate and oligourethaneacrylate with the ratio 85\/15 % (wt), \n0.1895 g polyethyleneglycol Mw 20000, 0.1068 g azobisisobutyronitrile. Thermo-initiated \nradical polymerization was carried out at 80\uf0b0C for 12 hours between two glass slides. To \nremove template molecules, non-polymerized compounds, polyethyleneglycol, and Cu (II), \nmolecularly-imprinted polymer membranes were extracted with hot methanol in Soxlet \napparatus for 8 h. That was followed by washing with 0.03%  aqeous solution of EDTA, \ndimethylformamide and water. Blank polymeric membranes were synthesized from the same \nmonomer composition, which did not contain catechol. The polymer with the different \ngeometry of the binding site was synthesized with resorcinol as a template molecule and was \nused as a second control.\n2.4. Measurements.\nTo estimate catalytic properties of the molecularly-imprinted polymer membranes, 60 \uf06dm \nmembrane samples (d=12 mm) were fixed near the surface of the oxygen electrode (\u041c\u0415RA-\nELWRO 5972, Poland) at the distance \u2248 3 mm  using a teflon O-ring. The measurements \nPage 4 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\nwere carried out at 25\uf0b0C in a 20 ml electrochemical cell filled with 100 \u043c\u041c \u0422ris-\u041d\u0421l buffer, \n\u0440\u041d 7.0, containing 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM CuCl2 under constant stirring. The \nelectrochemical cell had no head-space (atmosphere). Dissolved in a working solution O2\n(0.23 mM) was used as a source of oxidant for the reaction. The sensor responses were \ninitiated by injections (5\u2013100 \uf06dl) of a catechol stock solution in the same buffer to the \nreaction vessel. The change in the oxygen concentration during the reaction was monitored by \nthe universal oxymeter \u041c\u0415RA-ELWRO 5221 (Poland) and oxygen electrode \u041c\u0415RA-\nELWRO 5972 (Poland). \nCatechol concentration in the analyzed samples of drinking, river, and waste waters were \ndetermined also using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC system LC-20A\n(SHIMADZU, Japan), UV-detector, \uf06c=284 nm, column SUPELCOSIL LC-18-DB 250mm, \nt=25-27\uf0b0C, mobile phase 2% acetic acid in H2O 70% : acetonitrile 30%).\n3. Results and discussion\nSynthetic tyrosinase mimics combining ability of natural enzyme to catalytic cleavage of \nphenols with the stability in extreme environments were synthesized by the method of \nmolecular imprinting. \nIt is widely known that the active site of tyrosinase is a binuclear copper center capable of \noxidizing two molecules of o-diphenol to o-quinone with concomitant reduction of molecular \noxygen to two molecules of water (Fig. 1, a) [48, 49]. Therefore, the reaction of catechol \noxidation can be monitored by the oxygen electrode due to reduction of molecular oxygen on \nits surface according to the equation presented in Fig. 1, b. This reaction assumes \nsimultaneous coordination of the two Cu(II) ions by the o-phenolic oxygens with a copper-\ncopper distance 0.36 nm (Fig. 2, a).\nSeveral attempts were made to mimic enzymes able of conversion of o-diphenols to o-\nquinones [50, 51]. However, they usually involve multi-step organo-metallic synthesis, while \nthe results obtained are quite modest. \nSince the method of molecular imprinting can be used for metal imprinting [52, 53] it is\nattractive for the synthesis of catalytic Cu-containing polymers, mimicking a tyrosinase active\nsite. Taking into account data on the structure of the tyrosinase active sites, it was assumed \nthat catechol molecule, able to coordinate two Cu(II) ions at a distance 0.36\u20130.4 nm, can be \nimprinted using urocanic acid ethyl ester, mimicking histidine residues in the natural enzyme \n(Fig. 2, b). According to the principle of molecular imprinting, catechol extraction from the \nfully-formed polymeric network would result in formation of cavities where imidazole groups \noriented for complexation with Cu(II) and catechol.\nMolecularly imprinted polymer membranes with tyrosinase activity were synthesized \naccording to the method developed by our group for the synthesis of MIP membranes with \nreceptor properties [54, 55]. This approach assumes application of additional components-\nmodifiers\/elasticators in the traditional monomer mixture for MIP synthesis normally \ncontaining template, functional monomer and a cross-linker. Addition of the flexible linear \noligomer \u2013 oligourethaneacrylate provides synthesis of highly cross-linked molecularly \nimprinted polymer in a form of thin, flexible, and mechanically stable membranes. MIP \nmembranes were synthesized by radical thermo-initiated co-polymerization of the complex \nbetween o-diphenol, Cu(II), and urocanic acid ethyl ester with \n(tri)ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, and oligourethaneacrylate. The evidences for the tyrosinase \nactivity of MIPs synthesized with the same monomer composition were demonstrated in our \nprevious work on MIP particles [56]. The ratio template\/functional monomer was also \noptimized earlier [56, 57]. Dimethylformamide used as a porogen for the membrane synthesis \nwas supposed to provide good accessibility of the catalytic sites for the interaction with the \nanalyzed molecules. However, despite of good mechanical properties, the synthesized \nmembranes were characterized with very low catalytic activity. Apparently that was \nPage 5 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nassociated with their insufficient porosity (Fig. 3, a) and, as a result, poor accessibility of the \ncatalytic sites. \nTo increase porosity of the MIP membranes, the method of molecular imprinting was \ncombined with the principle of synthesis of interpenetrating polymer networks. The \neffectiveness of such approach was earlier demonstrated [58-60].\nA number of MIP membranes with catalytic properties were synthesized according to \nthe principle of semi-interpenetrating polymer networks. The cross-linked component of the \nsemi-IPNs was represented by the highly cross-linked MIP, while the linear semi-IPN \ncomponent was represented by polyethyleneglycol Mw 20 000. As it was expected, addition \nof polyethyleneglycol Mw 20 000 resulted in formation of significantly much more porous \nstructures (Fig. 3, b).\nBlank polymeric membranes were synthesized using the same mixture of monomers, which \ndid not contain catechol. MIP membranes synthesized with resorcinol as a template molecule \nwere used as a second control.\nThe catalytic MIP membranes synthesized according to the principle of semi-IPNs \nwere used as selective elements of a portable sensor system for phenols detection. Oxygen \nelectrode modified with porous catalytic MIP membrane was used as a transducer of this \nsystem.  \nTypical calibration curve of the developed sensor system is presented in Fig. 4. It was \ndemonstrated that MIP sensor systems based on the catalytic MIP membranes with the \noptimized composition allowed one to detect phenols in the aqueous solutions with the \ndetection limit 63 \uf06dM, while linear dynamic range comprised 0.063-1 mM (Fig. 4). Blank \npolymeric membranes synthesized from the same mixture of monomers, but in the absence of \nthe template demonstrated significantly lower sensor responses after addition of catechol to \nthe analyzed sample. Similar situation was observed also for the MIP membranes synthesized \nwith the changed geometry of the catalytic site (these polymeric membranes were synthesized \nusing resorcinol as a template molecule). Their insignificant catalytic activity clearly confirms \nthe imprinting effect: changed geometry of the catalytic sites can not provide conditions for \nthe effective catalysis. Importantly, virtually no catechol oxidation is observed in the working \nsolution in the absence of MIP membranes. On the contrary, modification of the oxygen \nelectrode with the catalytic MIP membranes resulted in immediate initiation of catecol \noxidation. That is a clear evidence for tyrosinase activity of the synthesized MIP membranes. \nThis phenomenon was discussed in detail in our previous work [56], where optimization of \nthe catalytic  MIP composition based on the analytical data on MIP-based sensor development \nis given. \nWorking characteristics of the developed sensor system based on catalytic MIP membranes \nwith tyrosinase activity were also investigated and optimized. Dependencies of the sensor \nresponses on buffer concentration (Fig. 5), NaCl concentration (Fig. 6) and pH of the \nanalyzed solution (Fig. 7) were investigated.\nAs it was expected, significant changes of the sensor responses were observed in response to \nthe increase in both buffer (Fig. 5) and NaCl concentration (Fig. 6). Apparently, under these \nconditions (especially at high buffer and NaCl concentrations) an increase in the Cu(II) \nadsorbtion by the molecularly imprinted polymer membrane occurs, which results in the \nincrease in the catechol oxidation rate. Similar situation is observed in the case of application \nof the natural enzyme (mushroom tyrosinase) as a selective element of biosensors for o-\ndiphenols detection: the rate of o-diphenols oxidation is increased with the increase in ionic \nstrength of the solution [61].\nInvestigation of pH-influence of the analyzed solution on catechol oxidation rate by the \nmolecularly-imprinted polymer membranes demonstrated that the pH-dependence had a \npronounced maximum at neutral pH values (Fig. 7). Catechol oxidation in solutions with \nPage 6 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\n\u0440\u041d\u22645 is almost inhibited (Fig. 7). These results are in a good accordance with the literature \ndata [62], demonstrating that Cu(II) ions are not adsorbed on surfaces modified with amino \ngroups at acidic pHs. Therefore, formation of the complex between Cu(II) and imidazole \nmoieties is inhibited as well as the catalytic oxidation of catechol by molecularly-imprinted \npolymer membranes with tyrosinase activity.  A decrease in values of the sensor responses at \nboth acidic and alkaline pHs can be also associated with swelling of the molecularly-\nimprinted polymer membranes at these conditions. Swelling of the MIP membranes can \nchange optimal geometry of their catalytic sites necessary for the effective catalysis. Swelling \nof the polymers in both acidic and alkaline conditions can be associated with the precence of \nboth: carboxygroups of (tri)ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate and imidazole groups of urocanic \nacid ethyl ester on the surface of MIP membranes.  One can expect ionization of \ncarboxygroups at alkaline pH values. In these conditions electrostatic repulsion of the \nnegatively charged polymeric chains occurs. That would facilitate swelling of the polymers in \nthese conditions. Similar situation can be expected also in acidic pHs, where imidazole \nmoieties would be positively-charged. These estimates are in accordance with the literature\ndata on swelling of molecularly-imprinted polymers [63]. However, in acidic conditions \ncatalytic oxidation of catechol is virtually inhibited. Therefore, one can assume that influence \nof the polymer swelling in these conditions is less significant as compared to complications \noccurring during formation of the complex between Cu(II) and imidazole moiety of the \npolymer.\nTo reveal general selectivity of the developed sensor system, close structural analogues of \ncatechol (phenol, 4-nitrophenol, 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzol, 2-methoxyphenol, m- diphenol, p-\ndiphenol. bisphenol A, 1,2-naphthalenediol, and 1,4-naphthalenediol) were added to the \nelectrochemical cell. In contrast to biosensor devices based on mushroom tyrosinase able to \nrecognition of different phenolic compounds [42-44], the developed sensor system was \ncharacterized with high selectivity: it was able of effective catalytic oxidation of o-diphenols, \nwhile no sensor responses was observed in the case of their structural analogues (phenol, 4-\nnitrophenol, and 2-methoxyphenol, m- diphenol, p-diphenol. bisphenol A, 1,2-\nnaphthalenediol, and 1,4-naphthalenediol ).\nThe developed sensor system was used for detection of o-diphenol concentration in both \nmodel solutions and real samples of tape, river, and wastewaters. The samples of tape, river, \nand wastewaters spiked with 1 mM catechol were used for the investigation (Table 1). It was \nshown that the results of o-diphenol detection by the sensor method were in a good \naccordance with those obtained by traditional HPLC method (Table 1). Interestingly, 1 mM \nof catechol was added to all the analysed real samples. However, only 0.4 mM catechol was \nrevealed in the sample 1 by both sensor and HPLC methods. The sample 1 was taken from \nriver Vita (Pyrogiv, Kiev region). The very probable reason for revealing significantly smaller \ncatechol amount by both sensor and HPLC analysis is significant contamination of the real \nsamples of the river water by soil bacteria. It is widely recognized that catechol dioxygenases \nare key enzymes in the metabolism of aromatic rings by soil bacteria. The decrease in both \nthe sensor responses and HPLC data can be caused by cleavage of the major part of the added \nto the sample 1 catechol by bacterial catechol dioxygenases. However, it should be noted that \nthe results of the sensor evaluation of this particular sample are in good agreement with those \nobtained by a traditional instrumental method (HPLC), proving applicability of the developed \nsensor system for the analysis of real environmental samples. \nStability of the developed sensor systems based on catalytic molecularly-imprinted polymer \nmembranes comprised 12 months (87% of the initial catalytic activity)\nAs compared to traditional instrumental methods the developed sensor system is simple, \ncompact, and can provide inexpensive express analysis of o-diphenols in aqueous samples. As \nPage 7 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\ncompared to the existing biosensor methods of phenols detection, the MIP-membrane-based \nsensor is highly stable.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nFor the first time catalytic free-standing molecularly-imprinted polymer membranes \nmimicking enzyme tyrosinase were synthesized using the combination of the methods of \nmolecular imprinting and semi-interpenetrating polymer networks. An easy-to-use and \neffective biomimetic sensor system for express o-diphenols detection in aqueous samples was \ndeveloped on their basis. \nAKNOWLEDGEMENT\nFinancial support from National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (Program \u201cSensor systems \nfor medico-ecological and industrial purposes\u201d) is gratefully acknowledged. \nPage 8 of 18\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\nREFERENCES\n1.
