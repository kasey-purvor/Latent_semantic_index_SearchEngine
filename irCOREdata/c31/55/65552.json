Over the period 1935 to the present the status of carrageenan has been \neffected by changes in the regulatory environment that reflect new understandings \nabout carrageenan, health and health risks as well as broader trade, social and political \nchanges. This paper reviews regulatory progress from the 1930s to the present.  It \nreflects, in particular, the shifting priorities in public health and their effects on the \nregulatory status of carrageenan.  Four case studies of public controversies about \ncarrageenan safety are discussed in relation to regulatory responses and their public \nhealth significance.  It is concluded that current assessments of risk associated with \ncarrageenan have, in some contexts, failed to take into account the full spectrum of \nsafety assessments that have been carried out and the maturing of food additive \nregulations thereby allowing a myth of risk to continue. \n \nKey words: carrageenan, degraded carrageenan, health risk, poligeenan, public health, \nfood regulation \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nCarrageenan is approved and widely used as a food additive (Bixler, 1996; Shah et al., \n2003). Despite official sanction for use in food, over the last 50 years, carrageenan \nhas been subjected to intense scrutiny for potential health risks associated with human \nconsumption. Controversy and debate about carrageenan and human health have \nperiodically flared in academic literature and the media (see for example Borthakur et \nal., 2007; Chapman, 2001; Cohen et al., 2002; Marcus et al., 1969; Shah et al., 2003; \nTobacman, 1998, 2001; Tobacman et al., 2001a; Tomarelli et al., 1974).  \n \nRegulatory authorities, and independent scientific advisory committees, have \nmaintained the position that carrageenan is safe for human consumption. Carrageenan \nis approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States \n(Food and Drug Administration, 2006)  by the European Parliament and Council \n(Commission Directive, 1995), and by the Joint World Health Organization and by \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (Cohen \net al., 2002). Yet in some jurisdictions precautionary measures have been instigated \nthat place restrictions on where and how carrageenan may be used: Carrageenan is not \npermitted for use in infant formula in Europe (European Parliament and Council, \n1995) but is permitted for use in the US (Food and Drug Administration, 2004).  \n \nThe Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) of the European Commission recently \nendorsed a molecular weight distribution limit on carrageenan that is more restrictive \nthan is the case in the US (Scientific Committee on Food, 2003a). At the same time, \nthe SCF acknowledges \u201e\u201ethere is no evidence \u2026 that exposure to low molecular \nweight carrageenan from the use of food-grade carrageenan is occurring.\u201f\u201f  This \nprecautionary approach provides a rationale for adverse public and government \nresponse in Europe that is not necessarily matched elsewhere. This example illustrates \nthe regulation of carrageenan is not uniform internationally; and controversy on the \nuse of carrageenan has not been resolved to the satisfaction of all (Borthakur et al., \n2007). \n \nLegislative action in relation to food safety issues is progressive (Merrill, 1997). This \npaper reviews the history of carrageenan from the time that it began to be industrially \nmanufactured for food use in the US to the present.  While differences still exist, there \nhas been a growing move in recent years towards international harmonisation of food \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulation through the Codex Alimentarius system and the EU Commission (Garrett \net al., 1998; Livermore, 2006; Millstone et al., 2002; Veggeland et al., 2005).  \n \nFour examples are discussed in which carrageenan use in foods has been associated \nwith risks to human health:  carcinogenicity and ulceration in the 1960s; baby formula \nconcerns in the 1980s, more recently controversy surrounding the publications of Dr. \nJoanne K. Tobacman and the appearance of weak mutagen in carrageenan. \nCarrageenan as a regulated food additive in the US \n \nUntil the late 1930s, what is now recognised as carrageenan (extract) was not widely \nused as a substance added to food and the term carrageenan did not exist in \nregulations for foods.  Decoctions of the seaweed Chondrus crispus had a long history \nof safe use in herbal and pharmaceutical preparations (See for example Council of the \nPharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, 1911; Felter et al., 1898).  Decoctions were \nmade by macerating the seaweed with water or milk. The gelling properties of \nChondrus crispus had also been utilised for centuries in food products, such as the \ndessert blancmange (Stanley, 1987). In 1862 Stanford coined the term \u201ccarrageenin\u201d \nfor the extract of Chondrus crispus; the spelling was later changed to carrageenan by \nthe American Chemical Society to reflect the use of \u2013an as an affix denoting the \npresence of a polysaccharide (McHugh, 2003). \n \nDespite knowledge of the properties of carrageenan-bearing seaweed in the mid \nnineteenth century, it was almost a further century before a commercial industry \nbased on the extracting carrageenan from certain seaweeds developed. In the US in \n1937 ground Chondrus crispus was found to stabilise dairy-produced chocolate milk. \nThree years later the Chicago based dairy company, Krim-ko, established a small \nplant near Boston to manufacture a water extract of Chondrus for chocolate milk and \njunket (Chapman, 1950; Lewis et al., 1988). Algin Corp of America in Rockland, \nMaine (later to become Marine Colloids, Inc and later still FMC Biopolymer) \ncommercialized carrageenan extraction in the US in the 1950s.  About the same time \nproduction of carrageenan began in Denmark and France. \n \nChondrus crispus (carrageenin) was regulated in food regulations in the US first as a \nGRAS substance, defined as a substance generally recognised as safe following the \n1958 Miller amendment to the US Food and Drug Act of 1938 (See Table 1 for a \nchronology of regulation of carrageenan). Under the Miller amendment the FDA \ndivided substances added to food into regulated food additives and substances that \nwere GRAS either due to their history of use in food prior to the 1st January 1958 (the \nso-called grandfather clause) or on the basis of a consensus of expert opinion. The \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMiller amendment prohibited the use of any new food additives considered \ninadequately tested for safety.  \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1 Summary of US Regulation of Carrageenan \n \nYear Event Status of carrageenan Stated aims \n1906 Federal Pure Food and \nDrugs Act and Federal \nMeat Inspection Act \nExtract not yet developed. \nCarrageenan-bearing \nseaweeds little valued as \nfood in US however long \nhistory of use in Ireland \nand elsewhere. \nRegulates safety and \nquality of food.

Under the GRAS listing Chondrus extract (carrageenin) was \npermitted for use in food under section 21CFR182.7255 of the US Code of Federal \nRegulations as harmless under prescribed conditions of use. However, for Marine \nColloids Inc., the status of Chondrus extract limited production capability. The \nwording of the GRAS legislation allowed just one seaweed species from which \ncarrageenan could be derived: Chondrus crispus.  \n \nDuring the early part of the 1950s a rapid increase in demand, and limited supply of \nChondrus crispus, led industry to explore other seaweed species as a source of the \nextract that was recognised by its chemical name carrageenan (Chopin, 1998). From \nthe 1950s into the 1960s the industry was experiencing other changes: increased \nknowledge of carrageenan chemistry and improved processes for optimizing \ncarrageenan performance in foods.  Industry members became interested in how to \ndevelop the raw materials supply through the use of a broader range of seaweed \nspecies, and through increasing interest in cultivation.  In 1960 Marine Colloids Inc. \npetitioned the FDA to alter the GRAS listing and to permit carrageenan to be defined \nby its chemistry, rather than the seaweed source.  FDA did not accept the chemistry \ndefinition but agreed to expand the seaweeds from which carrageenan could be \nextracted.  To effect this change the FDA moved to list carrageenan as a regulated \nfood additive under section 21CFR172.620, with the expanded, but limited, list of \nseaweed species and to establish a few purity criteria.  Some confusion was created \nwhen Chondrus extract (carrageenin) was still listed as GRAS, and the extract of \nChondrus crispus - \u201ecarrageenan\u201f was listed as a regulated food-additive, a situation \nthat still exists.   \n \nThe 1938 Act (See Table 1) was essentially a \u201epolicing statute\u201f to ensure government \nhad the authority to address dangers associated with foods or constituents of food that \nwere considered \u201einjurious to health\u201f(Merrill, 1997). The origins of the Act can be \ntraced to concerns about food adulteration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries \n(Coveney, 2003). Following World War II significant advances in processing, \npreservation and packaging were developed that  led to an increased interest and use \n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof food processing aids (Atkins et al., 2000). The 1938 Act did not require advance \napproval for substances added to foods and processing aids could be widely adopted.  \nIn 1952 the US Congress established a special commission, chaired by Congressman \nJames Delaney, to consider the growing use of chemical processing aids in foods and \nthe implications for consumer health. The resultant Food Additives Amendment \n(1958) was based on an assumption that anything added to food was adulterated \nunless it met with prior approval of the FDA, or unless there was already a long \nhistory of safe use (Merrill, 1997). Proving safety of new additives became the \nresponsibility of manufacturers (Food and Drug Administration, 2004).  The treatment \nof carrageenan was far from unique.  Other GRAS substances came under specific \nregulations about this time (Food and Drug Administration, 1958; Merrill, 1997). \n \nThe passage of food regulations transferred more and more responsibility from the \nFederal Government as enforcer of honesty and fairness, to focus on pre-market \ncontrols. Regulation of new substances added to food provided a scientifically \nverified guarantee of safety that was not the case for GRAS category, however it also \nincreased the surveillance of potential health risks by requiring manufacturers to \nprove, using scientific evidence, (usually from animal feeding studies) that any new \nadditive was safe for human consumption.   \n \nThe development of food regulations in the US was a prelude to similar actions in \nEurope and in the FAO\/WHO Codex Alimentarius; although occurring somewhat \nlater and usually by-passing the GRAS concept. \nFour Case Studies of Public Health Controversy \nCase I:  The origin of concerns and regulatory action: Ebimar  \n \nIn the mid 1960s a UK company Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline Beecham) began to \nmarket a pharmaceutical product called Ebimar in France. It was based  on \n\u201ecarrageenin\u201f which had been found to reduce the pain associated with peptic ulcers \n(Anderson et al., 1965; Bixler, 1996; Piper et al., 1961).  It was thought that stomach \nacids, including pepsin, contributed to the formation of ulcers (Anderson et al., 1965).  \nSulphated polysaccharides occurring naturally in the gastric mucous were found to \ninhibit the formation of pepsin. \u201eCarrageenin\u201f was proposed as a cheap and natural \nalternative to other synthetic sulphates of polysaccharides that had been proposed as \ntreatment agents.  \n \nAt the doses required, the carrageenan was extremely viscous and difficult to \nconsume in quantities thought necessary to produce a positive health benefit.  It is \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwell known that the viscosity of these solutions [carrageenin] could be reduced or \ndestroyed by controlled heating with dilute mineral acid followed by purification.  \nC16, the polygalactose sulfate component of Ebimar, was the product of this \ntechnology. \n \nGiven the limited knowledge of peptic ulcer causation, there was a correspondingly \nweak understanding of how or why the product worked. In the late 1960s, Marcus and \nWatt, two researchers under contract to the developers of Ebimar, undertook research \nto establish the mechanism through which low molecular weight carrageenan worked. \nDuring animal experimentation with both hydrolysed (C16) and unhydrolysed \ncarrageenan, the latter being the type used in foods, Marcus and Watt (1969) \ndiscovered that, at very high doses, both could produce ulcerations in the cecum of the \nguinea pig, but ulcerations were more severe with the degraded form.  Furthermore, \nthe dose below which food-type carrageenan caused no further ulcers still showed \nconsiderable ulceration with C16.  Marcus and Watts went on to speculate this \nulceration as a precursor to the disease ulcerative colitis. \n \nThis is a good point to introduce some nomenclature that is common knowledge today \namong scientists and regulators, but was a source of confusion in the 1960s and \ncontinues to be one for the general public.  C16 today would be called \u201cpoligeenan\u201d a \nname provided by the US Adopted Name Council (USAN).  While carrageenan is the \nraw material for producing poligeenan, the two different polymers have different \nproperties and uses.  Poligeenan with an average molecular weight of about 20,000 \ndaltons has none of the food functions of carrageenan whose average molecular \nweight is never lower than 100,000 daltons and is usually much higher.  The only \napplication today for poligeenan is as a component of an X-ray imaging diagnostic \nproduct.  Carrageenan for food use contains a very small fraction with a molecular \nweight in the range of that of poligeenan. Any suggestion that carrageenan with a \nsmall amount of low molecular weight matter could have the same ulcerating effect of \npoligeenan assumes equivalence between the substances. \n  \nWatt and Marcus concluded that the \u201c\u2026significance of our results in relation to \nhuman ulcerative colitis is at present only speculative and must await more \ncomprehensive investigation\u201d (Marcus et al., 1969, p. 188S). In 1969, carrageenan use \nin food was already widespread and as Marcus and Watt reported, at the time of their \npublication there had been \u201eno reports of adverse effects\u201f associated with carrageenan \nusage (Marcus et al., 1969, p. 187S).  \n \nOne effect of the Marcus and Watt publication was further surveillance and concern \nabout carrageenan safety.  Under FDA guidelines it was the responsibility of industry \n10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto prove carrageenan safe. Industry members conducted further studies involving \nother animal species. In 1972, the FDA reviewed carrageenan safety in light of \nMarcus and Watt\u201fs research and all the studies that had been generated as a result of \ntheir findings (Informatics Inc., 1972) \n \nOn the basis of the Informatics report, the FDA arranged a meeting with health \nprofessionals and industry representatives to discuss a motion to modify the \nregulations for carrageenan in light of concerns about ulcerations found in the Watt \nand Marcus studies. It was agreed that the issue was of little significance to human \nhealth. Nevertheless, precautionary measures were proposed to limit the molecular \nweight to a minimum of 100,000 and to seek further animal studies to confirm this \ndecision.  Since 1969 scientific assessments of carrageenan have included short-term \nand long-term generational studies involving different dosages of degraded and non-\ndegraded forms, and various animal studies including rats, mice, rabbits, rhesus \nmonkeys, squirrel monkeys, pigs, gerbils, baboons, hamsters, ferrets, chick embryos \nand dogs (Cohen et al., 2002; Greig, 1999; JECFA, 1974, 2001), While much of the \nabove work was going on in the United States, various of the toxicology studies were \nalso carried out in Europe.   \n \nAll of the studies supported the safety of carrageenan for use in foods.  Regulatory \nauthorities saw no reason to question the safety of carrageenan as long as the average \nmolecular weight was 100,000 daltons or higher. \n \nRegulations were modified to insure that carrageenan used in foods would meet this \nlimit, and a simple water viscosity measurement was adopted for this purpose. \nAs a further precautionary measure, Europeans limited the \u201eAcceptable Daily Intake\u201f \nof 75mg\/kg body weight\/day, an amount well above any average daily intake of even \na diet high in carrageenan content (Bixler, 1994).  More recently JECFA increased the \nADI to \u201cnot specified\u201d meaning the use of carrageenan in foods allowed was for \ntechnical functionality reasons and the amount used did not have to be numerically \nspecified (JECFA, 2001).    \n \nWhile the above work should have settled the carrageenan safety for food processors, \nit did not.  In 1984 labelling of food additives using the E number system came into \neffect among members of the European Economic Community. In the UK, additives \nhad not previously been listed on food products.  E numbers on food labels revealed \nadditives to supermarket shoppers for the first time.  The E numbers were widely \ninterpreted by the public as new chemicals being added to food, rather than as existing \nadditives being declared (London Food Commission, 1988, p. 39). In May 1986 \neighty-nine MPs from across all parties signed a motion to seek a ban on all \n11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunnecessary additives in children\u201fs food. In January 1987 the Ministry of Agriculture, \nFisheries and Food (MAFF) in the UK made public a survey of public attitudes to \nfood additives. The survey revealed that one third of the British public could not see \nany justification for using additives at all (MAFF, 1987). The survey was significant \nin demonstrating the failures of policy communication about food additives, but also \nwas linked to a more general decline of public trust in food policy and regulation \n(Lang, 1999). With increasing public concern about additives, and a declining trust in \npublic institutions, government regulators in the UK were under intense public \nscrutiny. Consumer groups were particularly active in voicing concern about baby \nfoods and pre-schoolers diets (Bixler, 1996). \nCase II Infant formula and carrageenan  \n \nAs already noted above, no foodstuff attracts more attention about safety than infant \nformula used in the first 4-6 months of a human life. It is considered particularly \nimportant because it may be the sole source of nutrition for infants over an important \nperiod of their physical development. Infant formula became a key policy concern \nearly in the twentieth century along with population-based measures indicating \ndeclining rates of breastfeeding in industrialised countries, and increased scientific \nunderstanding of the importance of nutrition (Murphy, 2004; Wolf, 2003). \nCarrageenan had been used in the US since the late1950s in liquid infant formulas to \nprevent fat separation and thereby assure more uniform nutrition.  However, Marcus \nand Watt\u201fs research generated sufficient concern to warrant further investigation.   \n \nIn the FDA\u201fs1972 review of carrageenan, the use of carrageenan in liquid infant \nformula was considered, and it was decided the benefits of using carrageenan noted \nabove outweighed any risk to the infant.  Even though the terms of the 1958 Food \nAdditive Amendment did not permit any public health benefits to be taken into \naccount in determining the safe use of additives, practical considerations made it hard \nfor regulatory authorities to exclude benefits in a risk assessment. \n \nIn Europe carrageenan is not permitted as a food additive for baby formula. The ban \ncan also be traced to more general concerns about food additives that emerged in the \n1980s.  In 1992 the UK Food Advisory Committee in MAFF commissioned an \nextensive report on additives in baby milk and weaning formulas and concluded about \ncarrageenan that: \n \n\u201cAlthough there is no direct evidence of harm from carrageenan in infants and no \ntoxicologically significant effects were seen in infant baboons fed carrageenan in \n12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommercial infant formulae for 16 weeks, high levels of reassurance are needed to \npermit additives in infant formulae. The Committee could not exclude the possibility \nof absorption of carrageenan by the immature gut or the possibility that absorbed \nmaterial might affect the immune system in the infant. The Committee does not \ntherefore consider carrageenan acceptable for use in infant formulae (European \nCommission, 1992).\u201d \n \nThe decision to ban the use of carrageenan in infant formulae, because of the \u201ehigh \nlevels of assurance\u201f needed, was subsequently reaffirmed by the EC-SCF (Scientific \nCommittee on Food, 2003b). The SCF suggested that because there was insufficient \ninformation on the effect of carrageenan on the immature gut of babies, its use was \ninadvisable but they had \u201eno objection to its use to the use of carrageenan, for \ntechnological reasons, in foods for older infants, such as follow-on formulae (SCF, \n1983) and weaning foods\u201f(Scientific Committee on Food, 2003b, p. 90). \nIndustry has continued to support the benefits of using carrageenan in liquid \ninfant formula and has sought to quantify risk and unequivocally assure safety \nto infants. New information has been provided to JECFA for their 2007 review of \ncarrageenan.\n13 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCase III The \u2018Tobacman\u2019 controversy \n \nConcerns about the use of carrageenan in food were not altogether assuaged despite \nthe precautionary approaches adopted by various regulatory agencies and even though \npoligeenan, a suspected human carcinogen, is not and never has been used as a food \nadditive. Poligeenan exists today specifically for diagnostic use only.  The small \namount of low molecular weight material present naturally in carrageenan is \nconsidered of no safety consequence by regulatory authorities. This is noteworthy \nbecause from time to time, academic researchers revisit the toxicity of poligeenan in \nrelation to food grade carrageenan. The most recent and vocal researcher to enter this \narena is Dr. Joanne K. Tobacman, currently at the University of Illinois in Chicago. \n \nIn Environmental Health Perspectives (EPH, 2001), a journal on environmental \nfactors and human health, Dr. Tobacman  reviewed all scientific literature relating to \ncarrageenan safety (Tobacman (2001).  The article reviewed 45 existing animal \nstudies on poligeenan and carrageenan in relation to safety for food use. Critiques of \nthe paper note how Dr. Tobacman ascribes results for poligeenan feeding studies to \ncarrageenan and the disregard for how the method of administration to the animals \ncan effect the results (Carthew, 2002; Cohen et al., 2002).   \n \nA consequence of this confusion of two different materials is exemplified in a quote \nfrom the author\u201fs interview of Dr. Tobacman in December, 2003. \n \n\u201eI guess that underlying this issue is the consideration about how much data are \nsufficient to make a judgement about carcinogenicity? Many animal studies \ndemonstrating ulcerations and neoplasms from carrageenan (sic) exposure were \ncompleted decades ago. What evidence and how much evidence does it take to lead to \nchanges in policy and behaviour? \u201e(Tobacman, 2003, pers. Comm., 3 December). \n \nFor Tobacman, rather than proving safety, the weight of evidence from past studies \nsuggested that carrageenan in foods is a risk. As already discussed, shifts in regulatory \npolicy in the 1950s required manufactures to produce \u201edata\u201f as evidence of safety. Her \nconcern was also fuelled by a clause in the 1958 Amendment that related specifically \nto carcinogenicity \u2013 the so-called \u201eDelaney clause\u201f.  The \u201eDelaney clause\u201f was \nintroduced as an additional clause to the Food Additives Amendment in 1958 and \nmandated that:  \n \n\u201e\u2026no additive shall be deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by \nman or animal, or if it is found, after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of \n14 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe safety of food additives, to induce cancer in man or animal\u2026\u201f (Quoted in Dean, \n1989, p. 6) \n \nTobacman\u201fs opponents have continued to stress that she is mixing up the suspected \ncarcinogenicity of poligeenan with the lack of any such toxicity of carrageenan \n(Cohen et al., 2002; Weiner et al., 2007). \n \nThe application of the Delaney clause may also be evaluated in a contemporary policy \ncontext.  Merrill\u201fs (1997) review of regulatory policy demonstrates that the regulatory \nauthorities did not anticipate, at the time the amendment was drafted, that the clause \nwould be applied to a vast range of substances as subsequently occurred. \n \n\u201eIn 1958, neither advocates nor opponents of the policy, including FDA officials, \nbelieved it would have broad application, for only a handful of chemicals had then \nbeen shown to be animal carcinogens\u201f (Merrill, 1997, p. 322) \n \nKnowledge of cancer-producing substances in the 1950s was largely confined to \npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; at that time not even cigarette smoke was accepted \nas carcinogenic (Weisburger, 1994). Not surprisingly, the \u201ezero risk\u201f tolerance applied \nto \u201enew\u201f chemicals with potential carcinogenic effects  (new including regulated food \nadditives not considered GRAS) has been extremely controversial (Merrill, 1997; \nNoah, 1999; Noah et al., 1998; Vogel, 2001; Weisburger, 1994).  Some argue that \nzero risk is necessary to protect the health of the public, others that carcinogens occur \nnaturally in many foods and are of little risk (Ames et al., 1997, 1998). Noah (1999, p. \n34) suggests that the Delaney clause is used with less rigidity in food and drug law in \nthe contemporary period because its wording preceded the development of more \nsensitive testing technologies and new medical knowledge about cancer. Where there \nis \u201ereasonable certainty of no harm\u201f, the Delaney clause is no longer used. \n \nA second paper, Tobacman et al. (2001) in the journal Medical Hypotheses used an \nepidemiological technique known as a \u201etime-trend\u201f analysis to correlate the increased \nuse of carrageenan in the twentieth century with the increased incidence of breast \ncancer. The authors wrote that \u201ealthough time-trend correlations represent a weak \nform of evidence, when significant positive correlations are found, they can support \nfurther evaluation\u201f (Tobacman et al., 2001a, p. 596). \n \nA further response to the Tobacman papers came from the European Commission \nScientific Committee for Food.  A Commission report, prepared to review and \n15 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncritique Tobacman\u201fs EPH and Medical Hypotheses papers, was critical of her findings \nin relation to the Medical Hypotheses article about which it concluded that it:  \n \n\u2026did not support the hypothesis that breast cancer may be causally related to intakes \nof carrageenan and other water-soluble polymers used as food additives. The \nCommittee noted that such correlations might be found for any dietary component or \nchemical to which there has been increasing exposure during the twentieth century \n(Scientific Committee on Food, 2003a, p. 6).  \n \nFurthermore, the Commission found nothing new in Tobacman\u201fs EPH review that \nhad not already been considered by the Scientific Committee for Food in determining \nthe safety, purity criteria and ADI for carrageenan.  \n \nAlthough the report was critical of many of Tobacman\u201fs findings, there was one issue \nupon which the Committee felt further research should be undertaken \u2013 the possibility \nthat \u201enative\u201f carrageenan could create significant amounts of poligeenan either by \nprocessing techniques or by acids during digestion. Like earlier controversies over \nbaby formula the perception of risk in Europe was deemed serious enough to warrant \na response. Thus regardless of the deficiencies of Tobacman\u201fs research, or the \ndiagnostic use of poligeenan for imaging, a precautionary approach was adopted. The \nCommittee suggested \u201eif feasible, a molecular weight limit of not >5% below 50,000 \nshould be introduced into the specification to ensure that the presence of any (low \nmolecular weight) carrageenan [in food] is kept to a minimum\u201f (Scientific Committee \non Food, 2003a, p. 6).  This specification is enforced today although no appropriate, \nvalidated analytical method is available to quantify the percentage of low molecular \nweight material in carrageenan. \n \nMore recently Tobacman has published on bench top experiments on the interaction \nof carrageenan with various organ cells (Borthakur et al, 2007).  The continued focus \nof her research has been to implicate carrageenan as a carcinogen by association. \nHowever, what happens in vitro does not provide a sufficient evidence base for what \noccurs in vivo.  Even if a harmful relationship could be established in vitro, in vivo \nstudies have demonstrated that ingested carrageenan does not pass the blood \u2013 gut \nbarrier to interact with organ cells. Moreover, recent studies contradict cancer-\nproducing effects of carrageenan and indicate that k-carrageenan may, though the \nenhancement of immune systems, actually inhibit tumours (Yuan et al., 2006).  Work \nthat seeks to establish a carrageenan\/carcinogen link continues to be fuelled by \nsuspicion. \n \n16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCase IV  Semicarbazide - A new problem handled quickly \nSemicarbazide (SEM), a weak mutagen, was used for years in Europe as an indicator \nfor the presence of  the banned veterinary antibiotic, Nitrofurazone (de la Calle et al., \n2005). The association between SEM and carrageenan came to attention through a \ncircuitous route (summarized in Table 2).   \n17 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 2. Public health concerns and semicarbazide  \nPre 1950s Azodicarbonamide (ADC) developed for use in plastics in Germany \n1993 Nitrofuran drugs used in animal husbandry banned in the European Union following \nfindings of mutagenic potential \u2013 zero-tolerance rules applied \n2002 Semicarbazide (SEM), a known metabolite of nitrofurans used as marker for nitrofuran \nabuse \u2013 routine analysis begins with (more) sensitive methods  \n2003 SEM found in foods of non-animal origin including tomato sauce, egg, high levels found \nin baby food   \n2003 Denmark issues EC alert notification 2003\/201 for \u201ecarrageen derived from see weed\u201f \nfrom Canada, Chile, Indonesia and Tanzania in relation to SEM and nitrofurans \n2003 SEM linked to packaging and ADC used for PVC gaskets (extensive use in baby food) \n2003 European Food Safety Authority finds SEM has weak mutagenic activity, low risk to \nhuman health. Nevertheless concerns about high levels in baby food  \n2004 Evidence of natural occurrence supports finding that SEM not a specific marker for \nnitrofuran abuse.  \n2004 Seaweed Industry Association Philippines announces budget to study SEM in \ncarrageenan. Industry begins to assess alternate methods of bleaching\/halt to bleaching. \nJune 2005 Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in \nContact with Food concludes issue of carcinogenicity is not of concern for human health \nat the concentrations of SEM encountered in food.\u201f \n2005 ADC banned from use in plastics \n \nThe EC, EFSA and the World Health Organisation have declared that, based on levels \nreported in food, the health risk, if any, to consumers, including infants, appears to be \nvery small (European Food Safety Authority, 2003; World Health Organization, \n2007). Nevertheless, at the time the issue came to light it created concerns that \ncarrageenan could pose a risk to human health.  The carrageenan industry through its \ntrade organization, Marinalg International, was required to perform tests for SEM on \nrepresentative commercial carrageenan products and issue a response (Marinalg \nInternational, 2003).  \n \nAt the time this issue arose there was a zero tolerance limits for SEM in foods, and \nthis combined with a subsequent discovery of SEM in baby food prompted what \nHoeneick et al.(2006, p. 29) describes as \u201eviolent discussions\u201f. The discovery of SEM \nin carrageenan (Hoenicke et al., 2004) demonstrated to these researchers that it was \nnot possible to differentiate between SEM resulting from Nitrofuran abuse; SEM \noccurring naturally or by bleaching processes involved in producing semi-refined \ncarrageenan (PES).  Subsequently tests demonstrated that SEM had weak mutagenic \nactivity and posed no risk to humans in the amounts likely to be consumed \n18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Abramsson-Zetterberg et al., 2005; AFC Panel, 2005; Hoenicke et al., 2006; \nHoenicke et al., 2004). \n \nThe SEM carrageenan issue is a reminder of the constitutive power of public health \nregulation in initiating suspicions of risk. Combined with concerns about carrageenan \nassociated with dated understandings of ulcerations and cancers and potential harm to \ninfants in liquid infant formula, the SEM example demonstrates that understanding \nrisk associated with carrageenan also requires an understanding of the different \nregulatory settings and contexts in which \u201erisks\u201f emerge as public health issues. \nDespite all the concerns so far discussed, carrageenan is still regulated as safe. \nDiscussion and conclusion \n \nAfter over fifty years of safe use of carrageenan in foods, some confusion and \nuncertainty in the public view still exists.  One reason for this is that scientific \naccounts of carrageenan risk rarely demonstrate the historical, regulatory and public \nhealth contexts. Carrageenan risks are routinely taken out of context (See for example \nTobacman, 2001; Tobacman et al., 2001a; Tobacman et al., 2001b). \n \nA recent 90 day rat feeding study that was initiated to determine if a carrageenan near \nthe lower molecular weight limit set by regulators (molecular weight of 257,000 \ndaltons with <5% below 50,000 daltons with a range of 1.9% \u2013 12%, determined by \nfour different methods) would cause any toxicological responses (Weiner et al., \n2006). The study concludes that carrageenan meeting regulatory purity criteria is safe \nfor human consumption. On the basis of these findings the authors argue that the new \nmolecular weight distribution specification for carrageenan in Europe is unnecessary. \nStudies of this type may help to clear up confusion from a scientific perspective, but \nthey do not appear to resolve perceptions of safety in other contexts. \n \nAn alternative framework for assessing and communicating risk is to review issues of \nsafety in their broader use and health contexts. For example, it is rarely mentioned \nthat carrageenan was intentionally degraded to make C16 for use in a specific \npharmaceutical product for peptic ulcer that is no longer on the market.  The only use \nfor this product today is industrial in nature (X-ray imaging diagnostics).  However, \nrenaming C16 poligeenan and the product for food use carrageenan may not be \nsufficient to allay public concerns.  An extensive education program placing these \ndifferent substances in a broader public health context may help. Without context a \nconsumer could easily assume equivalence between carrageenan and poligeenan. \n \n19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is also the increased recognition of the potential value of carrageenan for \nantiviral, hypocholesterolaemic and hypoglycemic properties (Smit, 2004).  If current \nrounds of research prove successful, carrageenan will play an important part in sexual \nhealth applications, such as microbicides for HIV\/AIDs prevention and use reduce the \nrisk of cervical cancers by inhibiting the Human Papiloma Virus (Buck et al., 2006; \nFernandez-Romero et al., 2007; Population Council, 2006). This diversity of possible \nnew uses for carrageenan across different regulatory settings provides a complex \ncontext for assessing health risks and benefits, but the positive nature of these \napplications will help the public and regulators to understand the potential health \neffects of different products.  \n \nThis paper offers some insight into how various concerns within public health have \ninfluenced the risk regulatory process.  At present regulation has provided support for \nthe safe use of carrageenan in food.  However, there is also the paradox that the more \nsafety is proven, the more controversial that proof becomes.  \n  \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe author wishes to thank Dimitri Stancioff, retired senior scientist from FMC \nBiopolymer for review of the history of carrageenan production and use and certain \nregulatory matters prior to 1970. \n \nReferences \n \nAbramsson-Zetterberg L, Svensson K (2005) Semicarbazide is not genotoxic in the \nflow cytometry-based micronucleus assay in vivo.
