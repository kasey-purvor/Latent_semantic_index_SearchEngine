Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic deformation appears to be \nconcentrated in the period 202\u2013197 Ma and was coeval with eruption of the Central \nAtlantic Magmatic Province, onset of Pangaea break-up, a period of extended normal \nmagnetic polarity and a major mass extinction event, all possible expressions of a \nsuperplume event.  Mid-Cretaceous deformation occurred in two brief periods, the \nfirst from approximately 116 to 110 Ma in the west palaeo-Pacific and the second \nfrom roughly 105 to 99 Ma in the east palaeo-Pacific, with both events possibly \nrepresented in northeast Siberia.  This deformation was coeval with eruption of major \noceanic plateaus, core-complex formation and rifting of New Zealand from \nGondwana, the Cretaceous normal polarity epoch, and a major radiation of flowering \nplants and several animal groups, all linked with the mid-Cretaceous superplume \nevent.  A simple unifying mechanism is presented suggesting that large continental or \noceanic plates, when impacted by a superplume, tend to break-up\/reorganize, \nassociated with gravitational spreading away from a broad, thermally generated \ntopographic high and with a resulting short-lived pulse of plate-marginal deformation \nand terrane accretion. \n \nLong-term episodicity of geological activity, i.e. variations of intensity or style \nwith time but not necessarily to any particular periodicity, has been proposed for \nmany processes, including aspects of magmatism (Prokoph et al. 2004) and tectonism \n(Condie 1998), from the Early Archaean to the present era.  Generally the origin of \nepisodicity has been attributed to mantle thermal behaviour.  This is either as gradual \n 3\nchanges associated with the growth and fragmentation of supercontinents, the so-\ncalled Wilson Cycle, as a result of processes such as thermal shielding (Condie 2002), \nor more catastrophic, non-linear events, referred to as superplumes (Abbott & Isley \n2002; Condie 1998; Larson 1991b) or mantle avalanches (Butler & Peltier 1997; \nMachetel 2003; Solheim & Peltier 1994).  In this paper, we review the evidence for \ntiming and nature of two episodes of Mesozoic terrane accretion and deformation \n(summarized in Tables 1 and 2).  We propose that these were superplume-driven and \nwe present a unifying mechanism and conceptual model for the interaction between \nlarge plates and superplume arrival from depth, focussing on deformation on the \nGondwana\/Pangaea margin during the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and deformation \non the margin of the palaeo-Pacific basin during the mid-Cretaceous.  Both mid-\nCretaceous and Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic deformation events were temporally \nassociated with a short-term global increase in the rate of ophiolite obduction \n(Vaughan & Scarrow 2003), and were associated with major, concentrated magmatic \nepisodes (e.g., Larson 1997; Riley et al. 2004), changes in geomagnetic field \nbehaviour (Biggin & Thomas 2003), and large-scale environmental perturbation \n(Hesselbo et al. 2002; Larson & Erba 1999).  Time and timing is obviously very \nimportant, particularly when relating event chronologies determined from the \nstratigraphic record with those determined radiometrically.  For consistency, all \nchrononstratigraphic series and stage range and boundary ages are taken from the \nInternational Commission on Stratigraphy timescale published by Gradstein et al. \n(2004). \n \nThe two enigmatic orogenic events under consideration here are well-\nrepresented in rocks on the Pacific margin of Gondwana during the Mesozoic.  The \n 4\nLate Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic event is called the Peninsula Orogeny in West Antarctica \n(Miller 1983) and the Rangitata I Orogeny in New Zealand (Bradshaw et al. 1981); \nthe mid-Cretaceous event is called the Palmer Land event in the Antarctic Peninsula \nregion (Kellogg & Rowley 1989; redated by Vaughan et al. 2002b) and the Rangitata \nII Orogeny in New Zealand (Bradshaw et al. 1981).  Below we illustrate the global \nextent of deformation associated with these events.  The Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic \nevent is widely developed in accretionary complex rocks that now sit outboard of \nrocks characteristic of continental Gondwana, and has recently been tentatively \nidentified in Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the Pensacola Mountains (Curtis 2002).  The \ndeformation episode, which is found in Gondwana-margin rocks from New Zealand, \nAntarctica and South America, is particularly significant because it appears to have \nbeen active just prior to, or during, the earliest stages of Gondwana break-up.  \nSuggested causes for the mountain-building event have varied widely, from Late \nPermian to mid-Jurassic dextral transpression and terrane collision (Martin et al. \n1999), earliest Jurassic to early mid-Jurassic sinistral transpression (Scheuber & \nGonzalez 1999), thermal uplift associated with the break-up of Gondwana (Dalziel \n1982), a terrane\u2013accretionary complex collision event (Bradshaw et al. 1981), or \nepisodic accretionary complex activity (Thomson & Herve 2002).  Aptian to Albian \nmid-Cretaceous tectonism widely affected rocks around the margin of the Pacific \nbasin (Vaughan 1995) (Fig. 2), and is well-developed in all terranes of the Antarctic \nPeninsula where it is reasonably well dated to have occurred between ~107 Ma and \n~103 Ma (Vaughan et al. 2002a; Vaughan et al. 2002b). \n \nDistribution of Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic deformation in Pangaea \n \n 5\nAntarctica \n \nThe Peninsula Orogeny (Miller 1983; reassessed by Storey et al. 1987) of West \nAntarctica was recognized to be an orogenic event that post-dated the Late \nPalaeozoic, Gondwanian orogeny (Curtis 2001), affecting Late Palaeozoic and \nMesozoic accretionary complex rocks such as the LeMay Group of Alexander Island \n(AI: Fig. 1) (Burn 1984; Tranter 1987) and Trinity Peninsula Group of Graham Land \n(TP: Fig. 1) (Aitkenhead 1975; Smellie 1981).  Deformed accretionary complex rocks \nof the Western Domain (Vaughan & Storey 2000), LeMay Group in eastern \nAlexander Island are overlain by Bathonian (168\u2013165 Ma) sediments of the Fossil \nBluff Group (Doubleday et al. 1993).  Dated LeMay Group rocks range in age from \nmid-Cretaceous in the west (Holdsworth & Nell 1992) to Sinemurian (197\u2013190 Ma) \nin the east (Thomson & Tranter 1986) and possibly older (Kelly et al. 2001), but, in \nthe absence of detailed field data, deformation can only be placed at pre-Bathonian \n(~168 Ma).  Permian\u2013Triassic turbiditic rocks of the Trinity Peninsula Group show \npolyphase deformation at anchizonal and epizonal metamorphic grade (Smellie et al. \n1996) prior to deposition of the Early to Middle Jurassic non-marine Botany Bay \nGroup (Cantrill 2000).  D2 deformation, which probably corresponds to the Peninsula \nOrogeny, constitutes an episode of margin-parallel sinistral transpressional shear \n(A.P.M. Vaughan unpublished data).  Deformation and metamorphism of accretionary \ncomplex metapelites and metagreywackes in the Scotia Complex (SC: Fig. 1) of the \nSouth Orkney Islands occurred in Early Jurassic times (200\u2013176 Ma) (Trouw et al. \n1997) and these rocks are overlain by the Early to Middle Jurassic Powell Island \nconglomerate (Cantrill 2000).  In the Patuxent Range of the Pensacola Mountains, \nEast Antarctica (PM: Fig. 1), a early Jurassic phase of deformation predates the \n 6\nintrusion of 183 Ma lamprophyre dykes and involved an inferred vertical axis rotation \nof pre-existing, end-Cambrian Ross and Permo-Triassic Gondwanian orogeny \nstructures with the localized development of a spaced foliation and mesoscale folding \n(Curtis 2002). \n \nSouth America \n \nThe Duke of York flysch of the Madre de Dios accretionary complex and the \naccretionary, Chonos metamorphic complex of Patagonia (C\/M: Fig. 1) both show a \nLate Triassic-Early Jurassic metamorphic event (Thomson & Herve 2002), between \n234 and 198 Ma, affecting sediments with detrital age patterns indicating Middle \nTriassic to Early Jurassic deposition (Herv\u00e9 & Fanning 2001; Herv\u00e9 et al. 2003).  In \nthe Bolfin Complex of the north Chilean Coastal Cordillera (CC: Fig. 1), amphibolitic \ngneisses and amphibolites were deformed by ductile transpressional shear zones that \nwere active during or post-emplacement of gneiss igneous protoliths at ~200\u2013191 Ma, \nand which are cross-cut by granite emplaced at ~174 Ma (Scheuber & Gonzalez \n1999).  Across South America, multiphase reactivation of pre-existing basement fault \nsystems, such as the Gastre fault system (GF: Fig. 1) (Rapela et al. 1992), occurred \nduring plate reorganization in Triassic\u2013Jurassic times (Jacques 2003a, b). \n \nCentral and North America \n \nIn the central Oaxaca terrane of Mexico (OT: Fig. 1), post-early Permian and \npre-Middle Jurassic thrusting and folding affected sedimentary rocks (Centeno-Garcia \n& Keppie 1999), and post Norian and pre-Aalenian (203\u2013175 Ma) thrusting affected \n 7\nLate Triassic submarine fan deposits at the contact between the Guerrero and Sierra \nMadre terranes in the Mesa Central of Mexico (MC: Fig. 1) (Silva-Romo et al. 2000).  \nAn episode of Late Triassic deformation is widespread in western Nevada (Thomson \n& Herve 2002). For example, Permo-Triassic marine clastic rocks of the Diablo and \nCandelaria formations of western Nevada (WN: Fig. 1) were overthrust by ophiolitic \nmelange prior to emplacement of rhyolitic and dacitic dykes dated at 222\u2013192 Ma \n(Thomson et al. 1995).  Deformation fabrics associated with the Luning\u2013Fencemaker \nThrust Belt of north-central Nevada (NN: Fig. 1) formed between 201 Ma and 193 \nMa with deformation probably continuing to early Toarcian (Wyld et al. 2001).  The \nCache Creek Terrane of the Canadian Cordillera (CT: Fig. 1) was imbricated by \ncollision with the Quesnel terrane following eruption of basaltic lavas at ~210 Ma and \nprior to granodiorite emplacement at ~173 Ma (Harris et al. 2003; Lapierre et al. \n2003).  The Quesnel terrane in southeastern British Columbia (QT: Fig. 1) preserves \nevidence of this deformation where ~215 Ma Late Triassic diorite is deformed prior to \nintrusion by undeformed 197\u2013181 Ma diorite and unconformable deposition of Early \nJurassic sediments (Acton et al. 2002).  In the Yukon-Tanana terrane of east-Central \nAlaska (YT: Fig. 1) Late Triassic to Early Jurassic (212 to 188\u2013185 Ma) northwest-\ndirected, apparently margin- parallel contraction and imbrication resulted juxtaposed \ndeformed arc and subduction complex rocks with parautochthonous continental rocks \n(Hansen & Dusel-Bacon 1998).  Yukon-Tanana terrane deformation of this episode in \nthe Teslin tectonic zone of southern Yukon Territory (TZ: Fig. 1) is Late Triassic to \nEarly Jurassic in age (Stevens & Erdmer 1996).  In the McHugh Complex subduction \nmelange of southeast Alaska (MH: Fig. 1), blueschists record a pulse of accretion at \n~195 Ma (Kusky & Bradley 1999). \n \n 8\nEurasia \n \nIn the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic the southern Eurasian margin was \naffected by a major orogenic event, the Indosinian (Golonka 2004).  At this time \nseveral microplates were sutured to the Eurasian margin, closing the Paleotethys \nOcean (Golonka 2004).  Late Triassic strike-slip and folding affected rocks from the \nTaimyr Peninsula in northern Russia (TA: Fig. 1) (Inger et al. 1999) and extends to \nNovaya Zemlya (NO: Fig. 1) and the south Barents Sea (Torsvik & Andersen 2002).  \nLate Triassic deformation of sediments in the Gobi Basin of Mongolia (GB: Fig. 1) is \nconstrained by radiometric dating to have occurred between 209 Ma and 206 Ma \n(Johnson 2004).  Many sedimentary basins in central Asia record Late Triassic \ndeformation (Otto 1997).  Ductile shear zones in Liaoning, North China (LP: Fig. 1) \nshow top to the southeast oblique thrusting dated at ~219 Ma by the Ar\u2013Ar method \n(Zhang et al. 2002).  Chen et al. (2003) described seven Mesozoic compressional \nphases in an overall tensional, probably subduction-related regime from southeast \nChina, the earliest of which is Late Triassic in age and coincided with the climax of \ncollision between the North and South China blocks (NS: Fig. 1) (Chang 1996).  A \nsyn-kinematic granite pluton, dated at ~197 Ma by the U-Pb zircon and Rb-Sr \nmethods, times late-stage Indosinian deformation on the Songpan-Ganzi fold belt, \nSichuan, west-central China (SG: Fig. 1) (Roger et al. 2004).  Deposition in the \nflexural foredeep to this fold belt, the Longmen Shan foreland basin (LS: Fig. 1), \nspanned the time period from 227 Ma to 206 Ma (Yong et al. 2003).  High greenschist \nto amphibolite grade metamorphism occurred during Late Triassic\u2013Middle Jurassic \nterrane collision in the Fujian Province of southeast China (FP: Fig. 1) (Lu et al. \n1994); similar aged collision on the Mianlue suture zone, part of the collision zone \n 9\nbetween the North China and South China blocks, in central China is associated with \nmajor gold mineralization (NS: Fig. 1) (Vielreicher et al. 2003).  Late Triassic\u2013Early \nJurassic deformation is also weakly developed in Peninsular Malaysia, related to \ncollision of an amalgamated Sibumasu\/Indochina\/South China with North China \nalong the Qinling\u2013Dabei Suture Zone (Meng & Zhang 2000) and to closure of Permo-\nTriassic rift basins along the Song Da zone in Laos and Vietnam (SD: Fig. 1) \n(Metcalfe 2000).  The Mazar accretionary prism in the Kunlun Mountains of \nsouthwest China (KM: Fig. 1) records Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic docking between \nthe Gondwanian Karakoram-Qiangtang block and the Eurasian Kunlun block \nimmediately prior to or during emplacement of 215\u2013190 Ma arc plutons (Xiao et al. \n2002).  In the Karakorum, Carnian\u2013Norian carbonate sediments folded by Eo-\nCimmerian deformation of Late Triassic age are unconformably overlain by \nPliensbachian\u2013Toarcian red bed deposits (Gaetani 1997).  Zircon fission track cooling \nages from the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau indicate uplift related to collision \nof the Qiantang block and Kunlun blocks (KM: Fig. 1) in the period 220\u2013200 Ma, and \nthis is reflected by a corresponding period of non-deposition or erosion in the nearby \nTarim basin (Jolivet et al. 2001).  Between the Caspian Sea and the Tien Shan in \nCentral Asia, accretion of central Iran to the southern margin of Eurasia resulted in an \nintense, Late Triassic episode of deformation with development of a widespread \nunconformity (Thomas et al. 1999).  The eastern part of the Donbas foldbelt of the \nUkraine (DF: Fig. 1) records intense Late Triassic-aged (Cimmerian) deformation \nwith widespread unconformity development between Triassic and Jurassic sediments \n(Stovba & Stephenson 1999).  Blueschists in metabasite rocks along the Izmir\u2013\nAnkara suture in northern Turkey (IA: Fig. 1) record a late Triassic pulse of Palaeo-\nTethys subduction from 215 Ma to 205 Ma during the Cimmeride orogeny (Okay et \n 10\nal. 2002).  Cimmeride deformation in Turkey was complete by Sinemurian times \n(~197 Ma) (Okay et al. 2002). \n \nNew Zealand \n \nBradshaw et al. (1981) described a Late Triassic deformation episode, the \nRangitata I orogeny, which marked the accretion of the older Rakaia sub-terrane of \nthe Torlesse Terrane to a trench-slope basin suite represented by the Caples Terrane.  \nWhite mica samples from deep levels of the Otago and Marlborough schists of South \nIsland, New Zealand (NZ: Fig. 1), yielded Ar\u2013Ar method ages that give a peak age for \nOtago Schist metamorphism of 180\u2013170 Ma (Little et al. 1999).  This deformation is \ninterpreted to have resulted from collision between the Torlesse Terrane and Caples \nTerrane (Mortimer 1993), and corresponds in time to the Rangitata I orogeny \n(Bradshaw et al. 1981).  Rb\u2013Sr method isochron ages of Brook Street, Dun Mountain-\nMaitai, and Murihiku Terrane metasediments of South Island show cooling age \npatterns that indicate low-grade metamorphism in latest Triassic and earliest Jurassic \ntimes (Adams et al. 2002).  This is possibly coincident with conglomerate deposition \nfrom 200\u2013180 Ma that recorded docking between the Median Tectonic Zone and \nBrook Street terranes (Tulloch et al. 1999).  Torlesse Terrane metasediments also \nshow Late Triassic to earliest Jurassic ages (225\u2013200 Ma) of burial metamorphism for \nthe Rakaia Subterrane, with postmetamorphic uplift and cooling continuing through to \nMiddle Jurassic times (~170 Ma) (Adams & Graham 1996). \n \nOther Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic events \n \n 11\nMagmatism \n \nEruption of continental flood magmatism provinces (areas of lava in excess of \n100,000 km2) and the formation of large igneous provinces (LIP) is characteristic of \nthe Late Triassic\u2013Early Cretaceous period.  Three continental LIPs, two basaltic and \none rhyolitic, were erupted in the period ~205\u2013160 Ma (Marzoli et al. 1999; Riley & \nKnight 2001; Riley et al. 2001) with conspicuous peaks of magmatism at 200 Ma and \n183 Ma.  The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP: Fig. 1) is one of the \nlargest continental igneous provinces erupted during the Phanerozoic (Tanner et al. \n2004).  The province erupted largely from ~205 Ma to 199 Ma (Marzoli et al. 1999; \nNomade et al. 2002) with early olivine dolerites at ~209 Ma in the Nova Scotia region \n(Pe-Piper & Reynolds 2000).  The Gondwana Large Igneous Province (GLIP: Fig. 1) \n(Riley et al. 2001; Storey & Kyle 1997) includes southern African Karoo basalts, \nAntarctic Ferrar gabbro and Kirkpatrick basalts, and the silicic magmatic province of \nSouth America and the Antarctic Peninsula, which constitutes one of the largest silicic \nprovinces on Earth (Pankhurst et al. 2000).  Basaltic eruption appears to have been \nconcentrated in a brief period at around 183\u2013182 Ma (Riley & Knight 2001; Riley et \nal. 2004), with rhyolitic magmatism in three pulses over a more extended period \nbetween 188 Ma and 153 Ma (Pankhurst et al. 2000).  Extensive bimodal basalt\u2013\nrhyolite magmatism in the period 186\u2013170 Ma, hosting economically important \nprecious and base-metal mineral deposits, is also recorded from British Columbia \n(Evenchick & McNicoll 2002; MacDonald et al. 1996).  Absence of an oceanic record \nfor this period makes identification of submarine flood magmatic provinces difficult; \nhowever, at least three potential oceanic plateau candidates exist:  1) the extensive \nWrangellia Terrane of northwest North America may represent an accreted basaltic \n 12\noceanic plateau that erupted at ~227 Ma (Kerr et al. 2000); 2) the Cache Creek \nTerrane of the Canadian Cordillera may represent an accreted oceanic plateau that \nerupted at ~210 Ma (CTP: Fig. 1) (Lapierre et al. 2003), and 3) an allochthonous \ntectonic unit of mafic volcanic rocks, the Nil\u00fcfer Unit of northwest Turkey, may \nrepresent a Palaeo-Tethyan, Triassic oceanic plateau accreted to the Laurasian margin \nduring the Late Triassic (NUP: Fig. 1) (Okay et al. 2002).  In addition to extrusive \nmagmatism, major plutonic complexes of Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic age are \ncommon on the Pacific and Tethyan margins of Pangaea.  For example, in the \nAntarctic Peninsula, plutonism was active in the Late Triassic\u2013earliest Jurassic (220\u2013\n200 Ma) (Millar et al. 2002; Wever et al. 1995), and in the Middle Jurassic (170\u2013160 \nMa) (Pankhurst et al. 2000).  Within-plate granites of this age are also recorded from \nthe Ellsworth\u2013Whitmore Mountains elsewhere in West Antarctica (Storey et al. \n1988).  Plutonism in southeastern Peru, was active in the intervals 225\u2013190 Ma and \n180\u2013170 Ma (Clark et al. 1990) and in Ecuador from 227 Ma to 200 Ma (Noble et al. \n1997).  Igneous rocks of Late Triassic to Early Jurassic age (228\u2013175 Ma) are \nwidespread in the western Cordillera of North America, and have potassic or \nshoshonitic compositions unlike igneous rocks before or after (Mortimer 1986, 1987).  \nFor example, in the east-central Sierra Nevada of California an intense pulse of K-rich \nplutonism has been identified at 180\u2013165 Ma (Coleman et al. 2003) and in northwest \nNevada high-K calc-alkaline plutons intruded between ~196 Ma and ~190 Ma (Quinn \net al. 1997).  In Sichuan Province, west-central China, plutonism was active from \n~197 Ma to 153 Ma, in northwestern China plutonism at ~198 Ma is associated with \ngold mineralization (Qi et al. 2004), and in southeast China, Jurassic plutons intruded \nin the interval 175\u2013160 Ma and cover an area of 900 x 400 km (Li et al. 2003).  Late \nTriassic\u2013Early Jurassic plutonism in the range 211\u2013183 Ma is also recorded from the \n 13\nKorean Peninsula and Japan (Arakawa et al. 2000; Cluzel et al. 1991; Kamei et al. \n2000).  Late Triassic magmatism (~220 Ma) is also evident in New Guinea \n(Crowhurst et al. 2004).  In North America, peaks of kimberlite magmatism occur at \n~196 Ma and 180\u2013176 Ma (Heaman & Kjarsgaard 2000), and at ~172 Ma (Kopylova \net al. 1998), the Yakutian kimberlite field of Siberia shows peaks in emplacement \nfrom 220 Ma to 240 Ma and from 170 Ma to 150 Ma (Heaman et al. 2003), in Africa \na pulse of kimberlite emplacement is recognised from 190 Ma to 150 Ma (Heaman et \nal. 2003), and in Australia in the Northern Territories kimberlites are recorded at ~179 \nMa (Belousova et al. 2001) and in South Eastern Australia at ~170 Ma (with \nlamproite magmatism at ~187 Ma) (Foden et al. 2002). \n \nGeomagnetic field \n \nGeomagnetic field changes around the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary are small, and \nperiods of extended polarity short, compared with what is recorded for the mid-\nCretaceous period (e.g., Gallet & Hulot 1997).  The Early Jurassic is relatively poorly \nknown (Yang et al. 1996); however, a several million year period of anomalously low \nreversal rate has been observed for the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary (Gradstein et al. \n2004; Johnson et al. 1995).  Although possibly not significant for changes at the core\u2013\nmantle boundary, this is roughly an order of magnitude longer than polarity intervals \nduring the preceding period of high reversal rate (mean ~500 ky) in the Late Triassic \n(Kent & Olsen 1999). \n \nAtmosphere and oceans \n \n 14\nShort-lived periods of extreme oceanic anoxia are recorded for the Late \nTriassic\u2013Early Jurassic interval (Hesselbo et al. 2000) with anomalous activity \nextending up to the early Middle Jurassic (Hesselbo et al. 2003).  For example, the \nglobal Early Toarcian (Early Jurassic) oceanic anoxic event (OAE) occurred at ~183 \nMa (Hesselbo et al. 2000), and carbon isotope excursions occurred at the Triassic\u2013\nJurassic boundary (Hesselbo et al. 2002).  Other OAEs also occurred at the end of the \nNorian (late Triassic; ~204 Ma) (Sephton et al. 2002) and in the Pliensbachian (Early \nJurassic; 189\u2013183 Ma) (Borrego et al. 1996).  CO2 levels, and probably atmospheric \ntemperatures, were substantially elevated across the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary \n(Beerling & Berner 2002), across the Pliensbachian\u2013Toarcian boundary (Hesselbo et \nal. 2000) and in the early Middle Jurassic (174\u2013170 Ma) (Hesselbo et al. 2003).  \nExamination of carbon isotopes in wood from this time suggest huge influxes of \nisotopically light carbon into the upper oceans, biosphere and atmosphere, for which \nrapid release of methane hydrate from marine continental margin sediments has been \nimplicated (Hesselbo et al. 2000; Hesselbo et al. 2003; Hesselbo et al. 2002).  \nIndicating the scale of this event, a major enrichment is seen in \u03b413C of hydrocarbons \nin the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, one of only three such shifts seen in the Late \nProterozoic and Phanerozoic (Andrusevich et al. 1998).  Episodes of anoxia and \naccumulation of carbon-rich sediments resulted in formation of abundant oil source \nrocks, including Late Triassic\u2013Middle Jurassic coal in Siberia (Il'ina & Shurygin \n2000; Kirichkova et al. 2003; Kirichkova & Kulikova 2002; Kirichkova & Travina \n2000).  The early Toarcian was a period of sea-level rise and marine transgression \n(Schouten et al. 2000) and the Triassic\u2013Jurassic boundary has also recently been \nrecognized as a time of sea-level rise (Hesselbo et al. 2004). \n \n 15\nBiotic changes \n \nTwo major mass extinction events occurred in the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic \nperiod.  The largest, one of the \"Big Five\" Phanerozoic mass extinctions (Hallam & \nWignall 1999; Jablonski & Chaloner 1994; Newell 1967), occurred at the Triassic\u2013\nJurassic boundary (~200 Ma) (Tanner et al. 2004), and the second across the \nPliensbachian\u2013Toarcian boundary (~183 Ma) (Aberhan & Fursich 2000) possibly in \nan extended period of extinctions lasting approximately seven million years (Little & \nBenton 1995).  Eruption of large igneous provinces and extinction events have been \ncausally linked but the relationships are not straightforward (Wignall 2001).  Oceanic \nanoxia and extinction at the Pliensbachian\u2013Toarcian boundary has been linked with \neruption of the main phase of the Gondwana large igneous province (Palfy & Smith \n2000; Riley & Knight 2001; Riley et al. 2004) and the end-Triassic extinction event \nhas been linked with the eruption of Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (Guex et al. \n2004; Wignall 2001).  Other extinctions are recognized in this period, including one \nin Late Norian times affecting Monotid bivalves and most ammonoids (~204 Ma) \n(Sephton et al. 2002) and two affecting ammonites in the Early Toarcian (~180 Ma) \n(Cecca & Macchioni 2004). \n \nDistribution of mid-Cretaceous deformation around the palaeo-Pacific ocean \n \nAntarctic Peninsula \n \nMid-Cretaceous deformation affects rocks forming all three tectonostratigraphic \nterranes identified by Vaughan & Storey (2000) (AP: Fig. 2).  In the Western Domain \n 16\nterrane (Vaughan & Storey 2000), the Fossil Bluff Group (Butterworth et al. 1988; \nCrame & Howlett 1988; Macdonald & Butterworth 1990) is interpreted to be an Early \nJurassic to late Early Cretaceous fore-arc basin sequence (Doubleday & Storey 1998; \nNichols & Cantrill 2002) overlying accretionary complex rocks on Alexander Island.  \nDeposition of sediments in this basin terminated in the late Albian (~100 Ma) with \nshoaling and uplift (Doubleday et al. 1993; Nichols & Cantrill 2002; Storey et al. \n1996) during dextral transpression (Doubleday & Storey 1998).  In the Central \nDomain terrane (Vaughan & Storey 2000) in northwest Palmer Land, a major flower \nstructure, forming a sinistral transpressional transfer zone, deforms Cretaceous \ngabbro, Late Triassic granodiorite and marble tectonic breccia of unknown age \n(Vaughan et al. 1999).  Biotite cooling ages in deformed gabbro and mafic dykes \nfrom the flower structure date sinistral shear and thrusting there at ~110 Ma (Vaughan \net al. 1999).  Mid-Cretaceous deformation is most strongly developed in the Eastern \nDomain terrane (Vaughan & Storey 2000).  The Eastern Palmer Land Shear Zone \n(Vaughan & Storey 2000) is a major ductile shear zone, up to 15 km wide, formed by \ndextral transpression and east-directed orthogonal compression, with activity dated at \n~103 Ma (Vaughan et al. 2002a).  This biotite cooling age, dated by the Ar\u2013Ar \nmethod, was obtained from ductilely thrusted mid-Jurassic gabbro.  This confirmed \nearlier work from eastern Palmer Land (Meneilly 1983, 1988) that suggested that \neast-directed overthrusts cut granodiorite dated at ~113 Ma.  In the Eastern Domain \nfarther south, in Ellsworth Land, Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Laudon & \nFanning 2003) marine sediments of the Latady Formation (Laudon et al. 1983) are \nthrust and openly folded (Vaughan et al. 2002b).  The peak of deformation coincided \nwith emplacement of a granitoid dyke dated by the U\u2013Pb SHRIMP method at ~107 \nMa (Vaughan et al. 2002b).  Sedimentary sequences of the Eastern Domain also show \n 17\na paucity of sediments between late Berriasian and Barremian times (Hathway 2000), \nprior to deposition of an Aptian to Eocene megasequence.  This hiatus probably \nresulted from changes in deposition and erosion caused by mid-Cretaceous \ndeformation.  The continuation into the northern Antarctic Peninsula of the terranes \nidentified by Vaughan & Storey (2000) in Palmer Land and Ellsworth Land is not \nclear, and evidence for mid-Cretaceous deformation is more sparse; however, this \nmay be a function of more recent and more intense mapping activity in the southern \nAntarctic Peninsula.  In northern Graham Land, west-directed, ocean-vergent folding \nand thrusting deformed mid-Cretaceous basaltic lavas of the Antarctic Peninsula \nVolcanic Group, dated at ~117 Ma, and these structures were cut by granodiorite \nplutons dated at 96 Ma (Birkenmajer 1994).  In northeast Graham Land, on the \nmargin of the Larsen Basin, localized folds and faults formed during a mid-\nCretaceous episode of sinistral transpression (Del Valle & Miller 2001).  East of \nnorthern Graham Land, on James Ross Island, coarse conglomerate units were \ndeposited and rafts of extrabasinal Jurassic strata incorporated in mostly mudstone \nAptian to Albian back arc sediments of the Larsen Basin (Ineson 1985, 1989; Riding \n& Crame 2002).  Although this constitutes less direct evidence for deformation, these \nhigher-energy events suggest that the arc was uplifted and rejuvenated in the mid-\nCretaceous.  At the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, along the South America\u2013\nAntarctica plate boundary in the vicinity of Elephant Island, Grunow et al. (1992) (EI: \nFig. 2) interpreted that mid-Cretaceous transpression had overprinted earlier evidence \nfor subduction activity and Trouw et al. (2000) placed this deformation at 110\u201390 Ma.  \nEast of the Antarctic Peninsula, in the Weddell Sea, Geosat radar altimetry data reveal \nmajor changes in spreading during the Cretaceous normal polarity interval (Livermore \n& Woollett 1993). \n 18\n \nOther areas of Antarctica \n \nIn this volume, Siddoway et al. (in press) described new dyke data from Marie \nByrd Land that indicate an episode of dextral shear predated formation of extensional \ngneiss domes in the period 105\u201394 Ma and prior to the onset of New Zealand\u2013\nAntarctica rifting.  Kinematic data from farther east along the margin (Vaughan & \nStorey 2000) and interpretation of seafloor data (Sutherland & Hollis 2001) support \nmid-Cretaceous dextral shear along this segment of the Gondwana margin.  In East \nAntarctica, adjacent to the Rennick graben in the Lanterman Range of Victoria Land, \nPermo-Triassic Beacon Group sediments and Jurassic volcanic rocks are thrust and \ntightly folded (Roland & Tessensohn 1987), during an episode of sinistral \ntranspression of possible mid-Cretaceous age (Tessensohn 1994) (LR: Fig. 2), \nalthough later authors have argued for Cenozoic-aged deformation (Rossetti et al. \n2003). \n \nSouth America \n \nDalziel (1986) noted the synchroneity of the first phase of mid-Cretaceous \ndeformation (Mirano diastrophic phase, 112\u2013105 Ma; MD: Fig. 2) along the western \nmargin of South America from the Magellan Basin to the West Peruvian Trough, \npost-dating Aptian-Albian sediments and predating intrusions and sediments formed \nfrom 105\u201380 Ma.  Evidence of hiatuses in sedimentation is also widespread in \nwestern South America in mid-Aptian and Aptian\u2013Albian times (Macellari 1988).  An \nunconformity related to one of these hiatuses cuts felsic tuff, dated at ~104 Ma, in the \n 19\nAndes of central Chile (Charrier et al. 1996).  Thrusting deformed Aptian\u2013Albian \nsedimentary and ophiolitic rocks of the mid-Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Rocas \nVerdes basin in South Georgia (SG: Fig. 2) (Macdonald et al. 1987) and in southern \nPatagonia (Dalziel 1986) and is linked to closure of a back-arc basin with associated \nophiolite obduction (Dalziel 1981).  In Cordillera Darwin (Kohn et al. 1993) (CD: \nFig. 2) amphibolite facies metamorphism of Palaeozoic basement rocks is associated \nwith thrust-related deformation of upper Aptian\u2013Albian sedimentary rocks (Dott et al. \n1977) with shortening of over 430 km from 110 Ma to 90 Ma (Halpern & Rex 1972) \nin the mid-Cretaceous (Kraemer 2003).  Cunningham (1995) pointed out that this \norogeny exhumes some of the highest metamorphic grade rocks in the Andes south of \nPeru and demonstrated a transpressional component to deformation with strain \npartitioning. \n \nIn northern Chile, the Atacama fault system (AF: Fig. 2) exhibits transpressional \nmovement and uplift which deformed plutonic and volcanic rocks older than ~111 Ma \n(Thiele & Pincheira 1987) and arc activity ceased in the mid-Cretaceous in that area \n(Brown et al. 1993).  The fault system was inverted in post-Early Cretaceous times by \ncontractional deformation that also resulted in widespread thin-skin thrust \ndeformation of sediments (Grocott & Taylor 2002).  Late Albian compression folded \nLower Cretaceous submarine volcanic sequences in western Peru (Mochica \ndeformation event of M\u00e9gard 1984) (ME: Fig. 2).  Late Albian uplift and erosion of \nmid-Albian sandstones is evident in western Columbia (Barrio & Coffield 1992) \n(WC: Fig. 2), and late Early Cretaceous metamorphism and deformation of Upper \nJurassic to Lower Cretaceous arc rocks is widespread from Columbia to Mexico \n(Dickinson & Lawton 2001; Tardy et al. 1994).  White mica and amphibole Ar\u2013Ar \n 20\nmethod ages from high pressure metamorphic rocks in the Coastal Fringe\/Margarita \nbelt of northern Venezuela (part of the Caribbean\u2013South American plate boundary, \nNV: Fig. 2) suggest that transpressional deformation occurred in mid-Cretaceous \ntimes at ~96 Ma (Smith et al. 1999). \n \nCentral America and Caribbean \n \nIn Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (HI: Fig. 2), Lower \nCretaceous island-arc rocks, believed to have formed part of a southwest-facing arc in \nthe Early Cretaceous (Pindell & Barrett 1990), are truncated by a major erosional \nunconformity overlain by shallow-water, Aptian-Albian limestone (Lebron & Perfit \n1993).  Draper et al. (1996) linked this to thrust emplacement of the Hispaniola \nperidotite belt in Aptian\u2013Albian times.  In Cuba, the Antilles arc accreted basaltic \nrocks of ocean plateau affinity in the period 112\u201391 Ma (Kerr et al. 1999).   \nPhengitic micas from the southern belt of the Motagua fault zone of Guatemala (GU: \nFig. 2) yield Ar\u2013Ar method deformation ages in the range 125\u2013113 Ma, recording \nmid-Cretaceous collision of the Chortis Block with western Mexico (Harlow et al. \n2004).  Early to mid-Cretaceous uplift and erosion affects a Barremian to mid-Albian \nlimestone sequence in Honduras (Weiland et al. 1992) (HO: Fig. 2).  Dickinson & \nLawton (2001) described the accretion of an arc terrane to the Mexican margin in late \nEarly Cretaceous time.  In Mexico, greenschist facies metamorphism, linked to \ncollision of the Guerrero terrane (Tardy et al. 1994) (GT: Fig. 2) affects plutons dated \nto be between 112 and 101 Ma (Stein et al. 1994). \n \n 21\nNorth America \n \nIn southern California, ocean-vergent, southwest-directed overthrusting has \ndeformed 118 Ma, magmatic-arc granodiorite of the western Peninsular Ranges \nbatholith (PR: Fig. 2) with the formation of mylonite zones dated at 115 Ma \n(Thomson & Girty 1994). Mylonite and granodiorite are truncated by 105 Ma tonalite \n(Thomson & Girty 1994) and deformation was probably active in the period 115\u2013108 \nMa (Johnson et al. 1999).  West-directed (i.e. oceanward) compression of the western \nPeninsular Ranges batholith in southern and Baja California also predated onset of \nemplacement of the eastern Peninsula Ranges batholith at 99 Ma (Kimbrough et al. \n2001).  A peak of Franciscan melange blueschist metamorphism appears to have \noccurred at this time (Ernst 1993).  In the Sierra Nevada of California (SN: Fig. 2) a \nmajor episode of thrusting is recognized deforming Jurassic and Cretaceous plutonic \nrocks between ~110 Ma and ~92 Ma (Mahan et al. 2003).  For example, contractional \ndeformation on the Bench Canyon shear zone shows multiple phases from ~101 Ma \nwith a peak at ~95 Ma (McNulty 1995), and synkinematic sheared orthogneiss from \nthe Tiefort Mountains is dated at ~105 Ma (Schermer et al. 2001).  A major thrust \nsystem of mid-Cretaceous age is developed along much of the Coast Belt of \nnorthwestern North America (CB: Fig. 2) (Umhoefer & Miller 1996).  Regional mid-\nCretaceous deformation is recognized in British Columbia (MacDonald et al. 1996) \n(BC: Fig. 2), with, for example, ocean-vergent thrusting (Journeay & Friedman 1993) \nof upper Valanginian to middle Albian volcanic rocks. Thrusting was active from at \nleast mid-Albian times to the emplacement of synkinematic plutons dated at ~97 Ma \nand ~96 Ma and deformed an accretionary complex that formed prior to 92 Ma \n(Chardon 2003).  In Cretaceous sedimentary sequences of northwestern Canada, \n 22\nmajor, regionally extensive unconformities exist in mid-Aptian, and between Albian \nand Cenomanian, strata (Dixon 1993, 1997).  On Duke Island, in southeast Alaska, a \nmajor and widespread episode of thrusting deformed ultramafic and arc rocks \nintruded from 111 Ma to 108 Ma (Butler et al. 2001) (DI: Fig. 1). In central and \nnorthern Alaska, ductile, north-directed overthrusting was active with blueschist and \namphibolite-facies metamorphism dated at ~108 Ma.  This formed during an episode \nof overall extension and metamorphic core-complex formation in the southern Brooks \nRange (Till et al. 1993; Till & Snee 1995) and major thrusting and tectonic \ntransportation of ophiolite terranes was coeval in the northern Brooks Range (Cole et \nal. 1997). \n \nEast and Southeast Asia \n \nIn the Anadyr-Koryak region of northeast Russia (AK: Fig. 2), Albian to \nCenomanian volcanic rocks, and Barremian-Aptian and Albian clastic sequences, \nunconformably overlie folded Callovian to Hauterivian island-arc rocks and \nPalaeozoic to Hauterivian arc marginal volcano-sedimentary sequences (Filatova & \nVishnevskaya 1997; Stavsky et al. 1990).  Deformation occurred in Barremian\u2013\nAptian (~120 Ma) and Albian (~105 Ma) times (Filatova & Vishnevskaya 1997; \nStavsky et al. 1990).  In the Chukotka Peninsula of the Anadyr-Koryak region, \ncompressional deformation from 124 Ma to 117 Ma, based on Ar\u2013Ar method dating \nof polydeformed greenschist- grade phyllites and marbles, is followed by a period of \nmetamorphic core complex formation from 109 Ma to 104 Ma (Toro et al. 2003).  \nOphiolitic thrusting in the Sikhote-Alin mountain range, eastern Siberia (SA: Fig. 2), \nis dated at ~110 Ma by the Ar\u2013Ar method (Faure et al. 1995).  Ophiolitic rocks in \n 23\nnorthern Japan (NJ: Fig. 2), containing a conformable sequence of Tithonian pelagic \nsedimentary rocks and Hauterivian to post-Aptian terrigenous fore-arc sedimentary \nrocks, were underthrust and accreted with uplift and metamorphism of arc rocks from \nBarremian times (130\u2013125 Ma) to at latest the time of blueschist metamorphism dated \nat 110 Ma (Kimura 1997; Kimura et al. 1994). Some evidence for a continuation of \nmore rapid accretion is suggested by more intense metamorphism of ophiolitic units \naccreted between Aptian and Cenomanian times (Kiyokawa 1992; Ueda et al. 2000). \nSanbagawa metamorphism is estimated to have occurred between ~120 and ~110 Ma, \nwith a peak at ~116 Ma, in central Shikoku, Japan (Isozaki & Itaya 1990; Okamoto et \nal. 2004) (SH: Fig. 2).  Associated metamorphism at ~116 Ma is also recorded for the \nJapanese Median Tectonic Line in the South Kitakami and paleo-Ryoke belts in \ncentral Japan (Sakashima et al. 2003) (CJ: Fig. 2).  In the Fujian Province of southern \nChina (FP, Fig. 2), gabbroic and ultramafic rocks of a dismembered ophiolite suite \n(Wang & Lu 1998) were emplaced on Paleozoic basement rocks by ocean-vergent \nthrusting coeval with ~115 Ma gabbro and granitoid plutons (Wang 2002), and \ncompressional shear joints dated at 107 Ma (Lu et al. 1994). Fission track dating also \nsuggests that uplift had ceased by ~110 Ma (Chen et al. 2002).  Ar\u2013Ar method \ncooling ages from the Changle-Nanao ductile shear zone in the same region suggest \nrapid uplift during the period 118\u2013107 Ma (Wang & Lu 1997).  In the Qilian Shan of \nwestern China (QS: Fig. 1), apatite and zircon fission track ages indicate a multiple-\nphase history of exhumation in the period 115\u201390 Ma (George et al. 2001) and the \nBainang terrane in the Yarlung-Tsangpo suture of southern Tibet records post-late \nAptian accretion of Tethyan oceanic rocks (Ziabrev et al. 2004).  Farther west in the \nKarakoram, Tethyan margin, shallow marine sediments of Aalenian to Lower \nCretaceous age and crystalline basement rocks are incorporated in huge thrust sheets \n 24\nthat are capped by thick deposits of mid-Cretaceous conglomerate (Gaetani 1997).  \nThe Truong-Son belt, of north-central Vietnam (TS: Fig. 2), shows metamorphism \nand mylonite formation in the period 120\u201390 Ma with notable peaks at ~115 Ma and \nbetween 106 Ma and 103 Ma (Lepvrier et al. 1997).  In the western Philippines (WP: \nFig. 2), east-directed thrusting deforms Lower Cretaceous ophiolitic rocks \nunconformably overlain by a middle Eocene hemipelagic sedimentary sequence \n(Faure et al. 1989), which is possibly related to the collision of the West Philippine \nblock with the China-Indochina margin in latest Early Cretaceous times (Lapierre et \nal. 1997).  In Java, Sulawesi, and Kalimantan (JS: Fig. 2), an extensive high pressure-\nultra-high pressure metamorphic basement terrane was recrystallized and uplifted \nduring collision of a Gondwanan continental fragment with the Sundaland margin \nbetween 120 Ma and 115 Ma (Parkinson et al. 1998). \n \nAustralia \n \nIn the Surat basin of eastern Australia (SB: Fig. 2), uplifted and eroded upper \nAptian marine sedimentary rocks are unconformably overlain by early Albian, paralic \nsedimentary rocks (Harrington & Korsch 1985; O'Sullivan et al. 2000).  This is event \nalso affected basins in northeastern Australia (Laura and Carpentaria) (CA: Fig. 2) \nand Papua New Guinea (Papuan) (PB: Fig. 1) (Haig & Lynch 1993).  It is associated \nwith increased Aptian\u2013Albian tectonism in the eastern half of Australia, supported by \nfission track evidence for increased exhumation rates (Marshallsea et al. 2000) and \npalaeobathymetric evidence for non-eustatic changes in base level (Campbell & Haig \n1999; Henderson 1998).  In the New England orogeny of eastern Australia, mid-\nCretaceous deformation (WI: Fig. 2) affected voluminous (1.4 x 106 km3) volcanic \n 25\nand plutonic rocks of the Whitsunday Volcanic Province and others (WVP: Fig. 2) \ndated at between 132 Ma and 95 Ma (Bryan et al. 2000; Harrington & Korsch 1985), \nalthough the age of deformation may be more tightly constrained because magmatism \npeaked between 120 Ma and 95 Ma (Bryan et al. 1997).  Deformation is largely \nexpressed as open folds associated with major faults (O'Sullivan et al. 2000), and may \nbe associated with a major phase of extension in eastern and southeastern Australia in \nthe middle Cretaceous (O'Sullivan et al. 1996; O'Sullivan et al. 2000). \n \nNew Zealand \n \nThe tectonic situation of New Zealand is complex, with a terrane interpretation \nthat has evolved rapidly (e.g., Kear & Mortimer 2003; Leverenz & Ballance 2001; \nMortimer 2004) since early suggestions for South Island (Coombs et al. 1976) and \nNorth Island (Sporli 1978) and comprehensive definition by Bradshaw (1989).  \nDeformation of Early Cretaceous age was first recognized in New Zealand (the \nRangitata II phase of Bradshaw et al. 1981), where it was initially interpreted as a \nphase of deformation affecting convergent margin terranes.  The age of deformation is \nbased on widespread Aptian, Albian, and intra-Albian angular unconformities in \nsedimentary rocks of eastern New Zealand (Bradshaw 1989), with a mid- to late \nAlbian age of last deformation (~105 Ma, Bradshaw 1989; ~100 Ma, Laird & \nBradshaw 2004).  Since the key papers by Bradshaw et al. (1981) and Bradshaw \n(1989), much evidence has come to light for different aged metamorphic events in \ndifferent parts of New Zealand, for example, at ~116\u2013105 Ma in Fiordland (Klepeis et \nal. 2004), 100\u201385 Ma in the Wellington region (Adams & Graham 1996; Kamp \n2000), 86 Ma in the Southern Alps (Vry et al. 2004) and 71 Ma in Otago (Mortimer & \n 26\nCooper 2004).  In addition, an episode of rifting has been identified associated with \nlocal high temperature extension and magmatism, which formed the Paparoa \nmetamorphic core complex between 110 and 90 Ma (Muir et al. 1997; Spell et al. \n2000).  Metamorphic events in the Southern Alps and Otago at ~86 Ma and ~71 Ma \nare probably related to final collision of the Hikurangi Plateau and the opening of the \nTasman Sea (Mortimer & Cooper 2004; Vry et al. 2004).  These post-date \ncontractional deformation being considered here.  The older events, from Fiordland \nand the Wellington region, fall in the range of mid-Cretaceous deformation from other \nparts of the Pacific basin margin.  In the Fiordland region of southern South Island, \ncontractional deformation was coeval with magma emplacement of the Median \nBatholith from 116 Ma to 105 Ma (Klepeis et al. 2004) (SI Fig. 2).  Mid-Cretaceous \ncompression overlaps in age with formation of the hyper-extensional Paparoa \nmetamorphic core complex which was magmatically active from 110 Ma to 90 Ma \n(Muir et al. 1997); however, the earliest depositional ages from intercalated tuffs \nsuggest that the switch from compression to extension was at ~101\u2013102 Ma \n(Bradshaw et al. 1996; Muir et al. 1997) and oroclinal bending associated with mid-\nCretaceous compression had probably ended by 110 Ma (Bradshaw et al. 1996).  In \nsouthern North Island (NI Fig. 2), low temperature metamorphism of sandstones of \nthe accretionary Pahau Subdivision of the Torlesse Terrane (Adams & Graham 1996), \nand deformation, is dated by zircon fission track data to have occurred in the period \n100\u201385 Ma (Kamp 2000).  Deformation is represented, for example, by folded, Upper \nJurassic to Aptian-Albian argillic and metabasic rocks in the Wellington region, \ninterpreted to be part of a dismembered seamount (George 1993), which are cut by \n~99 Ma lamprophyre dikes. \n \n 27\nNew Zealand and expression of plate boundary forces \n \nNew Zealand is one of the best-studied areas, which has revealed that mid-\nCretaceous deformation there has a complex expression.  An examination of Cenozoic \nto Recent tectonic activity in New Zealand illustrates the kind of variation that can be \nseen along quite short stretches of an active margin.  In particular, superimposed on \nthe pre-rift (Laird & Bradshaw 2004) terrane complexity described by Bradshaw \n(1989) and Mortimer (2004) is the large-scale, ~460 km (Sutherland et al. 2000), \nCenozoic movement of the Alpine Fault (Norris et al. 1990).  The fault is a distributed \nstrike-slip transfer zone (Hall et al. 2004) between east-directed subduction to the \nsouth (Norris & Cooper 2003) and west directed subduction to the north (Delteil et al. \n2003) and illustrates that the expression of plate boundary forces is not necessarily \nstraightforward.  In this context, the plate boundary forces, changes in subduction \nrate, potential slab capture, and collision of the Hikurangi Plateau, all of which \ncombined to drive mid-Cretaceous deformation in New Zealand may have been \nexpressed in different but co-existing ways.  In South Island, we probably see the \nmost straightforward expression, where accelerated plate motion and heat flow are \nlikely to have driven magmatism and contractional deformation in the period 116\u2013105 \nMa.  In North Island, the situation was complicated by the approach of the Hikurangi \nPlateau (Vry et al. 2004) and a possible ridge\u2013trench collision (Luyendyk 1995).  \nContractional deformation appears to have stopped at about 100 Ma, followed by a \nperiod of slab roll-back and extension prior to final collision of the Hikurangi Plateau \nat ~86 Ma.  This was followed by opening of the Tasman Sea (Vry et al. 2004) and \nassociated basins (Carter 1988),  and onset of New Zealand\u2013Antarctica rifting (Laird \n& Bradshaw 2004). \n 28\n \nOther mid-Cretaceous events \n \nMagmatism \n \nEruption of submarine basalt plateaux (areas of oceanic lithosphere with \nthickness > 10 km) and the formation of basaltic large igneous provinces (LIP) is \ncharacteristic of the mid-Cretaceous period (Kerr et al. 2000). Six oceanic LIPs were \nerupted in the period 122\u201388 Ma (Coffin & Eldholm 1994; Mortimer & Parkinson \n1996) with conspicuous peaks of magmatism at 122 Ma and 90\u201388 Ma (Kerr et al. \n2000).  The Ontong-Java Plateau (OJP: Fig. 2) is the largest known in the geological \nrecord (Coffin & Eldholm 1994) and erupted in close proximity to the Manihiki \n(MAP: Fig. 20 and Hikurangi (HIP: Fig. 2) plateaus.  Fragments of an Aptian\u2013Albian \noceanic plateau that accreted to the Antilles arc (LAP: Fig. 2) in the period 112\u201391 Ma \nare preserved in Cuba (Kerr et al. 1999).  Not all plume impact sites were under \noceanic lithosphere.  The Rajmahal Traps of eastern India were erupted at ~118 Ma \nand were possibly related to emplacement of the chemically similar Kerguelen \nPlateau at the same time (Kumar et al. 2003) and the second phase of the Bunbury \nbasalts of western Australia (BUB: Fig. 2), which erupted at ~123 Ma (Courtillot & \nRenne 2003).  All three are closely spatially associated on reconstructions of \nGondwana, and pre-date rifting-off of India (Kumar et al. 2003).  New evidence \nsuggests that the Bermuda plume was responsible for 2-3 km of mid-Cretaceous uplift \nwith erosion and magmatism in the Mississippi Embayment (Cox & Van Arsdale \n2002), and Maher (2001) has identified a largely terrestrial, mid-Cretaceous high-\nArctic large igneous province, with magmatic ages currently poorly constrained in the \n 29\nrange 135\u201390 Ma.   As in the case of the Bermuda plume, the high-Arctic province is \nassociated with uplift and denudation.  For example, mid-Cretaceous apatite fission \ntrack cooling ages in Carboniferous sediments, probably associated with exhumation, \nhave been recorded in East Greenland at this time (Johnson & Gallagher 2000); a \nwidespread mid-Cretaceous unconformity is developed in the northern part of the \nmid-Norwegian margin (Lundin & Dore 1997); and an associated unconformity is \ndeveloped as far south as the Atlantic Western Approaches Trough (Ruffell 1995).  \nGranitic magmatism also shows a widespread mid-Cretaceous peak.  The Lassiter \nCoast intrusive suite of the southern Antarctic Peninsula, which covers an area of \n~500 x 100 km, shows a major peak in magmatism between about 115 and 95 Ma \n(Pankhurst & Rowley 1991).  A major peak of I-type magmatism is evident in \nThurston Island with emplacement from 125 Ma to 110 Ma (Pankhurst et al. 1993), \nand a pulse of A-type granitoid magmatism is recorded in western Marie Byrd Land \nbetween 115 Ma and 95 Ma (Siddoway et al. in press).  Bruce et al. (1991) identified \na mid-Cretaceous peak of Andean magmatism occurring between 120 Ma and 70 Ma \nand the North Patagonian Batholith shows a peak of emplacement between 120 Ma \nand 90 Ma (Pankhurst et al. 1999). This is supported by palaeomagnetic data that \nsuggests that the major part of the North Patagonian Batholith was intruded during the \nCretaceous Long Normal Interval (Beck et al. 2000).  A pulse of plutonism is seen in \ncentral Mexico from 110 Ma to 100 Ma (Stein et al. 1994).  The 800 km-long eastern \nPeninsula Ranges batholith of southern and Baja California was intruded between 99 \nMa and 92 Ma with interpreted magma flow rates comparable to those estimated for \nflood basalt eruptions (Kimbrough et al. 2001); the western Peninsular Ranges \nbatholith of Baja California shows a peak of tonalite magmatism between 115 Ma and \n103 Ma (Tate & Johnson 2000).  In California, plutonism in the east-central Sierra \n 30\nNevada batholith is concentrated in a brief period from 102 Ma to 86 Ma (Coleman et \nal. 2003); the voluminous Tuolumne intrusive suite of the Sierra Nevada batholith \nwas emplaced between ~95 Ma and ~85 Ma (Coleman et al. 2004).  A newly \nrecognized episode of cauldron subsidence with emplacement of rhyolite domes \noccurred from 107 Ma to 104 Ma in central British Columbia (MacIntyre & \nVilleneuve 2001).  Tin-associated magmatism in the Khingan-Okhotsk belt of eastern \nSiberia, extending over 400 km, occurred episodically in a short period around ~95 \nMa (Sato et al. 2002).  The adakitic, Separation Point magmatic suite and associated \northogneisses, the Karamea batholith, and the Paparoa batholith, all of the Median \nBatholith of New Zealand were emplaced in the period 120\u2013105 Ma (Mortimer et al. \n1999; Muir et al. 1998; Muir et al. 1997; Waight et al. 1998).  Kimberlite magmatism \nalso peaked in the mid-Cretaceous, with a period of increased emplacement rate in \nRussia from 105 Ma to 95 Ma, in North America from 103 Ma to 94 Ma, and in \nAfrica from 116 Ma to 70 Ma (with a brief hiatus from 100 Ma to 95 Ma) (Heaman et \nal. 2003). \n \nPost-compressional extension \n \nIn general, mid-Cretaceous compression is followed by extension or \ntranstension, usually from ~100 Ma on, and often on a spectacular scale, probably as a \nfunction of the high heat flow associated with a superplume event.  In New Zealand, \nMarie Byrd Land, and eastern Siberia metamorphic core complexes formed (Muir et \nal. 1997; Siddoway et al. 2004; Siddoway et al. in press; Toro et al. 2003).  Ductile \nextensional structures formed from 105 Ma to 94 Ma following thrusting of the \nPeninsular Ranges batholith in southern California (Thomson & Girty 1994), \n 31\ntranstensional basins formed in the Canadian Cordillera (Bassett & Kleinspehn 1996), \nand major extensional basins formed following widespread thrusting in Alaska (Till et \nal. 1993). \n \nGeomagnetic field \n \nThe Cretaceous long normal polarity interval of the geomagnetic field (e.g., \nGallet & Hulot 1997) lasted from 125\u201384 Ma and is one of the key pieces of evidence \nfor the mid-Cretaceous superplume event (Larson 1991b).  There is some \ndisagreement over the intensity of the geomagnetic field during the Cretaceous long \nnormal polarity interval, which some models suggest should have been stronger than \nnormal (Tarduno et al. 2001).  Measurements of geomagnetic field intensity are \ndifficult to make (McElhinny & Larson 2003) and complicated by post-preservational \nchanges (Doubrovine & Tarduno 2004).  Although new evidence suggests that the \ngeomagnetic poloidal field intensity was reduced just prior to (Pan et al. 2004) and \nduring (Biggin & Thomas 2003) the Cretaceous long normal interval, other authors \n(Tarduno et al. 2001, 2002) present convincing evidence that the field was up to three \ntime stronger than in the preceding Late Jurassic or following Cenozoic. \n \nAtmosphere and oceans \n \nShort-lived periods of extreme oceanic anoxia are recorded for the mid-\nCretaceous interval (Handoh & Lenton 2003; Leckie et al. 2002).  For example, the \nglobal Selli ocean anoxic event (OAE-1a) occurred between 120.5 and 119.5 Ma \n(Larson & Erba 1999), and the global Bonarelli OAE-2 occurred at the Cenomanian\u2013\n 32\nTuronian boundary (~93.5 Ma) (Pancost et al. 2004).  Other events that are more \nrestricted in distribution within Tethys occurred at 113\u2013109 Ma (OAE-1b) and ~99.5 \nMa (OAE-1d) (Leckie et al. 2002).  Maximum sea surface temperatures were 3\u20135 \ndegrees warmer than today, but with pronounced variability that possibly triggered \nOAEs (Wilson & Norris 2001).  Reef drowning is also characteristic of this period \n(Wilson et al. 1998) and the mid-Cretaceous period saw some of the highest sea levels \nin the Phanerozoic (Haq et al. 1987) with highstands in the Early Aptian (~118 Ma), \nLate Albian (~102 Ma), and Turonian (93\u201390 Ma) (Strasser et al. 2001).  Episodes of \nanoxia and accumulation of carbon-rich sediments, resulted in major accumulation of \noil source rocks (e.g., Nzoussi-Mbassani et al. 2003), including abundant coal \noffshore Nigeria (e.g., Obaje & Hamza 2000), and the mid-Cretaceous is the most \nprolific of six periods of accumulation of effective oil source rocks during the \nPhanerozoic (Andrusevich et al. 1998). \n \nBiotic changes \n \nApart from an extinction event at the Cenomanian\u2013Turonian boundary (~94 Ma) \n(Harries & Little 1999), in terms of disappearance of major groups, the Cretaceous \nlong normal polarity interval (125\u201384 Ma) is generally only associated with higher \nrates of turnover in mineralized plankton taxa (Leckie et al. 2002).  Rather than going \nextinct, faunal and floral groups experienced major radiations in this period, which \nappears to have been the peak of the so-called \"Mesozoic Marine Revolution\" (Alroy \n2004; Bambach 1999; Vermeij 1995).  The angiosperm and pollinating insect taxa \nwent through a major expansion at this time (Grimaldi 1999; Kress et al. 2001; Lupia \n1999), as did several fern groups (Nagalingum et al. 2002).  Many groups of tetrapods \n 33\nradiated into their main modern groups, including frogs, turtles, lizards, snakes, and \nbirds (Benton 1996). Among marine invertebrates, speciation was particularly marked \namong some groups of bryozoans (Jablonski et al. 1997) and a peak in bivalve \ndiversity is also recognized (Checa & Jimenez-Jimenez 2003). \n \nDiscussion and model \n \nIn this section, some key similarities between Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and \nmid-Cretaceous deformation events will be outlined and a unified conceptual model \nfor break-up of large plates will be presented. \n \nLate Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic deformation, Pangaea and Mesozoic oceans \n \nEpisodic periods of coincident continental rifting and marginal collision have \nbeen described for the Tethyan Ocean from Late Permian to Late Eocene times, with \nsignificant events in the mid-Late Triassic and end-Early Cretaceous (Kazmin 1991; \nRicou 1994).  What singles out the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic deformation is that it \noccurred at a time when Pangaea was starting to break-up, and when extension, rather \nthan compression, would have been expected to dominate plate kinematics.  The pre-\nbreak-up configuration of Pangaea only came into being in the Late Permian (Muttoni \net al. 2003) and Pangaea break-up models have the added feature of needing to \naccommodate the presence of a partially intra-supercontinent ocean, Tethys (Fig. 1), \nwith differently evolving margins in its eastern and western parts (Ricou 1994).  The \nrelationship between Triassic Palaeo-Tethys and the Pangaea-surrounding, \nPanthallasan Ocean (Fig. 2) is comparable to the relationship between the Indian and \n 34\nPacific oceans today.  In terms of plate motions, apparent polar wander paths for \nNorth America show significant changes in velocity at ~200 Ma and ~160 Ma (Beck \n& Housen 2003), the earlier of which would have coincided with Late Triassic\u2013Early \nJurassic deformation on the Pangaea margin.  Recently, it has been shown that a \nglobal pulse of ophiolite obduction events also occurred in the Late Triassic\u2013Early \nJurassic (Vaughan & Scarrow 2003) (Fig. 3), which is consistent with the widespread \nevidence for Pangaea-margin compression at this time.  Although it is not possible to \ndetermine a cause and effect relationship with Pangaea-events, formation of the \nPacific Plate, dated at 175\u2013170 Ma (Bartolini & Larson 2001; Fisk & Kelley 2002), \nfollowed a major oceanic plate reorganization at ~190 Ma (Nakanishi et al. 1992).  \nThis coincided with initial break-up of Pangaea associated with increased subduction \nrates at its outer margins (Bartolini & Larson 2001). \n \nMid-Cretaceous deformation and Cretaceous oceans \n \nMid-Cretaceous compressional deformation is not restricted to the margins of \nthe palaeo-Pacific basin (Fig. 2) and is extremely widely developed, even more \nwidely so than summarized here.  For example, the northern margins of Neo-Tethys \nin the Mediterranean region also show deformation of this age, for example in \nnorthern Spain (Monie et al. 1994), Corsica (Malavieille et al. 1998), Slovakia \n(Plasienka 2003), Hungary (Haas & Pero 2004), and Greece and Bulgaria (Zagorcev \n1994).  Although not directly associated with initiation of continental break-up, mid-\nCretaceous deformation is closely followed in several areas by episodes of high rates \nof extension, as outlined above, and in the case of New Zealand by rifting-off and \ndrifting of a continental fragment from Gondwana.  Major reorganization of the \n 35\nPacific Plate occurred at 120 Ma (Nakanishi & Winterer 1998; Sutherland & Hollis \n2001) coincident with eruption of magmas associated with the formation of the \nOntong-Java plateau among others (Kerr et al. 2000).  Apparent polar wander paths \nfor North America show significant changes in velocity at ~125 Ma and ~88\u201380 Ma \n(Beck & Housen 2003) and the period 125\u201384 Ma shows ocean crust production rates \nthat are 50% to 75 % higher than the rates before and after this period (Larson 1991b). \n \nSuperplume\u2013lithospheric plate interaction \n \nThe following features unify Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and mid-Cretaceous \ndeformation: 1) Both occurred at a time of elevated mantle heat flow, as evidenced by \nconcentrated episodes of voluminous magmatism on the continents and in the oceans; \n2) both appear to have occurred at times of anomalously low reversal rate of the \ngeomagnetic field (although this is less clear for the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic \nevent), further implicating the mantle in whatever caused them; 3) both are followed \nby periods of unusually high rates of continental extension, Pangaea\/Gondwana \nbreak-up in the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic case and extensional core complex \nformation in the mid-Cretaceous case; 4) both are associated with oceanic plate \nreorganization and major changes in plate velocity; 5) both occurred at times of \nsubstantial environmental and biotic change.  This co-occurrence of extreme global \nmagmatic, geomagnetic, environmental and biotic events points to one particular \ncausal mechanism, involving simultaneous ascent of multiple hot plumes of material \nfrom the deep mantle, a \"superplume event\" (Larson 1991b, 1992).  The global \ndistribution of hotspot magmatism, involving substantial continental and oceanic \nexpressions in Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and mid-Cretaceous times as outlined \n 36\nabove, makes more local mechanisms, such as thermal blanketing (e.g., Anderson \n1998) less likely to have been responsible.  Figure 3 illustrates some of the events \ncoeval with Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and mid-Cretaceous deformation and shows \nthe distribution of proposed superplume and geomagnetic events, major tectonism, \nophiolite obduction, sea-level variation, and biotic and environmental changes \nthrough the Phanerozoic.   \n \nThe relationship between deformation and superplume events will be discussed \nin detail below; however, it is worth touching briefly on the relationship between the \nrise of hot plumes of mantle material to shallow levels and the magmatic and \npalaeoenvironmental changes outlined above.  The relationship between magmatism \nand advection of heat to the upper mantle is the easiest to understand.  As described \nabove, flood volcanism, plutonism and kimberlite emplacement appear to be coeval in \nthe Triassic\u2013Jurassic and mid-Cretaceous periods.  For example, the widespread \ndistribution of A-type, I-type and adakitic plutonism around the Pacific basin in the \nperiod 125\u201390 Ma, coeval with oceanic LIP and kimberlite emplacement, points to \nelevated heat flow over a large area of the globe.  The situation for \npalaeoenvironmental proxy data in the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and mid-\nCretaceous period and links with high rates of volcanism is less clear, and the subject \nof much discussion (e.g., Hesselbo et al. 2002; Larson & Erba 1999).  Much current \ninterest is focussed on the possibility that small, initial magmatism-related phenomena \ncan trigger larger palaeoenvironmental changes (Beerling & Berner 2002; Tanner et \nal. 2004).  The trigger mechanisms include thermally driven elevation in crustal heat \nflow (Jahren 2002), fall in sea-level (Paull et al. 1991), CO2-driven atmospheric \nwarming (Beerling & Berner 2002; Jenkyns et al. 2001), or uplift of ocean floor \n 37\n(Jahren 2002).  These are invoked to trigger catastrophic, massive dissociation of \nmethane hydrate deposits in shallow marine settings (Jenkyns et al. 2001) or at \ncontinental high latitudes (Kidder & Worsley 2004), with consequent large rises in \natmospheric temperature, changes in ocean and atmosphere composition, and biotic \nradiations and extinctions (Jahren 2002; Retallack 2002; Tanner et al. 2004). \n \nLate Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and mid-Cretaceous deformation post-date the start \nof their respective superplume events by only a few million years, whereas ophiolite \nobduction pulses follow up to 10\u201320 million years later.  Vaughan & Scarrow (2003) \nsuggested that this delay may be a consequence of the time it takes to close a back-arc \nbasin, the commonest setting for ophiolitic source rocks, following a change in plate \nboundary forces.  The evidence for both episodes of deformation outlined above, and \nsummarized in Tables 1 and 2, suggests that deformation was concentrated in a short \ntime period, of the order of five million years.  Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic \ndeformation appears to have occurred between 202 and 197 Ma and mid-Cretaceous \ndeformation in two periods ~116\u2013110 Ma in the west palaeo-Pacific and ~ 105\u201399 Ma \nin the east palaeo-Pacific, with both events possibly represented in northeast Siberia \n(Filatova & Vishnevskaya 1997; Stavsky et al. 1990).  The geological record indicates \nan abrupt onset for superplume events and consequently there has been much \ndiscussion of a triggering mechanism, usually involving changes in mantle convection \nstate and geomagnetic field behaviour following sudden transfer of ponded cold \nsubducted material into the deep mantle (Condie 1998; Solheim & Peltier 1994; \nTackley et al. 1994).  Associated cooling at the core\u2013mantle boundary is argued to be \na possible cause of perturbations of the geomagnetic field (e.g., Muller 2002).  One of \nthe main, large-scale effects inferred for a superplume event is heating of the upper \n 38\nmantle and thermal elevation of the overlying lithosphere (Larson & Kincaid 1996) \nand developing the model proposed by Vaughan (1995) we will argue here that this is \nthe key process responsible for superplume-related deformation. \n \n\"Oceanic\" case \n \nRising mantle plumes associate with the mid-Cretaceous superplume event \nlargely impacted oceanic lithosphere.  Vaughan (1995) argued that for deformation \nassociated with the mid-Cretaceous superplume event, which we will refer to as the \n\"oceanic\" case (Fig. 4), thermal uplift and rejuvenation of ocean floor during multiple \nhot plume impact at the base of the lithosphere resulted in increased gravity sliding \nfrom a broad (~10,000 km across according to Larson (1991b)) topographic high \nwhich increased ridge push.  Figure 4a shows the pre-superplume state with a notional \nlarge ocean with single spreading ridge and a back-arc basin floored by oceanic \nlithosphere.  The subducting margins of the large ocean are in a state of mild tension, \nwhich is the common observed situation globally today (Hamilton 1994).  In Figure \n4a, this is a result of roll-back of the old and cold subducting slab at the trench.  The \nmargins of the smaller, younger back-arc basin are in mild compression because of \nridge-push forces.  The commonest model for the mechanism that triggers superplume \nevents involves accumulation of cold subducted slab material at the 670 km \ndiscontinuity or phase boundary (Machetel 2003; Tackley et al. 1994) and this \naccumulation is depicted in Figure 4a.  Figure 4b shows the onset and effects of a \nsuperplume event.  The 670 km discontinuity is inferred to be an endothermic phase \nboundary, i.e. with a negative Clapeyron slope (e.g., Mambole & Fleitout 2002), in \nother words energy is required to cross the boundary downwards which means it acts \n 39\nas a barrier to further descent of upper mantle material into the lower mantle.  Models \nfor the onset of superplume events suggest that gravitational potential energy of \naccumulating cold subducted material is eventually sufficient to overcome the \nresistance of this phase boundary (Solheim & Peltier 1994) and a mantle avalanche is \ngenerated that descends rapidly to the core\u2013mantle boundary (Fig 4b).  This has two \neffects on mantle convection: an initial broad return flow that elevates the 670 km \ndiscontinuity and the upper mantle, followed by deep-rooted mantle plumes generated \nfrom increased lateral thermal variation at the core\u2013mantle boundary (Larson & \nKincaid 1996).  This heating and elevation of the upper mantle triggers large-scale \nadiabatic decompression melting and magmatism (Larson & Kincaid 1996).  The \nadvected heat to the upper mantle has the effect of uplifting and thermally \nrejuvenating oceanic lithosphere over a broad area and, by topographically elevating \nthe ridge, increasing ridge push force.  A larger ridge push force increases the \nconvergence rate at subduction zones and thermal rejuvenation of oceanic lithosphere \nincreases the degree of coupling between the subducting and overriding plate, both of \nwhich combine to produce ocean-marginal compression.  In Figure 4b, this is \nexpressed as, for example, back-arc basin closure and arc collision or ophiolite \nobduction (Vaughan & Scarrow 2003), but is inferred to be the general cause for mid-\nCretaceous deformation and widespread terrane accretion. \n \n\"Continental\" case \n \nFigure 5 illustrates the situation for deformation associated with a superplume \nevent where rising mantle plumes impact largely beneath continental lithosphere.  \nApart from some evidence for oceanic hotspot magmatism at 227 Ma (Lapierre et al. \n 40\n2003) and 210 Ma (Kerr et al. 2000), most Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic large igneous \nprovince magmatism and inferred mantle plume impacts affected the continents.  \nDeformation associated with this putative superplume event we refer to as the \n\"continental\" case.  In the pre-superplume state, as before, subducted oceanic \nlithosphere accumulates at the 670 km discontinuity, beneath subduction zones on the \nedges of a supercontinent.  In Figure 5a the supercontinental margins are in tension \n(Hamilton 1994) as for the \"oceanic\" case.  In Figure 5b a superplume event is \ninferred to initiate by the same process as outlined above, but with the variation that \nheat advection to, and uplift of, the upper mantle occurs beneath continental \nlithosphere.  This results in adiabatic decompression melting and magmatism, as \nbefore, and generation of a broad, thermally generated topographic high.  \nGravitational sliding away from this high increases the coupling between continental \nlithosphere in the hanging wall of subduction zones and the subducting slab, and may \nresult in over-riding of oceanic lithosphere by continental lithosphere, both of which \ncombine to generate supercontinent margin deformation.  At the same time, \ngravitational sliding away from the topographic high triggers the onset of \nsupercontinental break-up.  The temporal association between the onset of break-up \nand continent marginal compression provides support for active models of \nsupercontinent break-up involving mantle plumes (Storey 1995) because passive \nmodels require plate margins to be in a state of tension.  The environment of Late \nTriassic\u2013Early Jurassic deformation is almost certainly made more complex by the \npresence of an effectively intra-continental palaeo-Tethyan ocean.  The evidence for \nhotspot magmatism in this ocean in the Late Triassic (Okay et al. 2002) raises the \npossibility that a situation akin to the mid-Cretaceous \"oceanic\" case may also have \n 41\nbeen active, subjecting Pangaea to a \"double-whammy\" from the point of view of \nsuperplume-related deformation. \n \nSummary - a unifying mechanism \n \nOceanic and continental lithospheric plates appear to behave in similar ways \nwhen impacted from beneath by multiple plumes of hot rising mantle material.  In \nterms of plate-marginal deformation in the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and mid-\nCretaceous, this can be summarized as the result of increased plate coupling at \nsubduction zones during gravitational sliding of lithosphere away from broad, \nsuperplume-generated, thermally supported topographic highs.  Evidence for Early \nJurassic (Nakanishi et al. 1992) and late Early Cretaceous (Nakanishi & Winterer \n1998; Sutherland & Hollis 2001) changes in palaeo-Pacific plate geometry, and Early \nJurassic evidence for continental break-up or mid-Cretaceous periods of anomalous \nperiods of extension, suggests that multiple plume impacts at the base of lithospheric \nplates are also likely to trigger plate reorganization.  This is expressed as formation of \nnew spreading ridges and the death of existing ones in the case of oceanic lithosphere, \nand continental break-up or high-rate extension in the case of continental lithosphere.  \nBoth can be described in terms of \"break-up\".  \"Oceanic break-up\" (Fig. 4b) is \ncomparable to continental break-up, but more subtly expressed, because breaking-up \noceanic lithosphere, i.e. forming new spreading ridges, simply creates more oceanic \nlithosphere.  Both can also be described in terms of plate reorganization: continental \nbreak-up can be viewed as plate reorganization of continental lithosphere.  However, \nthis break-up\/reorganization relationship is the fundamental point that links mid-\nCretaceous and Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic deformation and that points to a unifying \n 42\nmechanism for superplume\u2013plate interactions.  This can be summarized in the \nfollowing sentence: when lithospheric plates are impacted from beneath by multiple \nplumes of hot rising mantle material they break-up\/reorganize associated with \ngravitational spreading away from a broad, thermally generated topographic high and \nwith a resulting short-lived pulse of plate-marginal deformation.  This simple \nmechanism provides a unifying framework for continental and oceanic plate \nbehaviour during the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and mid-Cretaceous superplume \nevents, explains episodicity of terrane accretion, and provides strong supporting \nevidence for active models of supercontinent break-up. \n \nConclusions \n \nA review of evidence for deformation on the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic \nmargins of Pangea and the mid-Cretaceous margins of the palaeo-Pacific ocean, and \nexamination of the relationships between plate-marginal deformation and coeval \nprobable superplume events, results in the following conclusions: \n \n1. Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic deformation is widely developed on the margins of \nPangaea (expressed as the Indosinian orogeny in Eurasia) and appears to have \noccurred in a short period between 202 Ma and 197 Ma. \n \n2. Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic deformation was coeval with eruption of the Central \nAtlantic Magmatic Province, onset of Pangaea break-up, a longer than usual period of \nnormal magnetic polarity in the Rhaetian\u2013Hettangian and a major mass extinction \nevent, all possible expressions of a superplume event. \n 43\n \n3. Mid-Cretaceous deformation occurred in two brief periods, the first from ~116 Ma \nto ~110 Ma in the west palaeo-Pacific and the second from ~105 Ma to ~99 Ma in the \neast palaeo-Pacific, with both events possibly represented in northeast Siberia, and is \nalso developed on the northern margin of neo-Tethys. \n \n4. This deformation was coeval with eruption of major oceanic plateaus, extensional \ncore-complex formation and rifting of New Zealand from Gondwana, the Cretaceous \nnormal polarity epoch, and a major radiation of flowering plants and several animal \ngroups (pollinating insects, birds, frogs, snakes, lizards, turtles, bryozoans and \nbivalves), all linked with the mid-Cretaceous superplume event. \n \n5. Plate-marginal deformation in the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic and mid-Cretaceous \ncan be conceptually modelled as the result of increased plate coupling at subduction \nzones during gravitational sliding of lithosphere away from superplume-generated, \nthermally supported topographic highs. \n \n6. A simple unifying mechanism for superplume\u2013plate interactions, and support for \nactive models of supercontinent break-up, can be summarized thus: When large \noceanic or continental plates are impacted from beneath by multiple plumes of hot \nrising mantle material they break-up\/reorganize associated with gravitational \nspreading away from a thermally generated topographic high and with a resulting \nshort-lived pulse of plate-marginal deformation, often associated with terrane \naccretion. \n \n 44\nThis is a contribution to the British Antarctic Survey Core Project \"Superterranes in the \nPacific-margin arc\" (SPARC).
