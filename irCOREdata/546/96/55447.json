This residue is used \nto obtain a low sugary liquid when \nmixed with water, and after alcoholic \nfermentation can be either exploited as \nraw material to obtain a low quality \nvinegar or sold to alcohol factories to \nobtain ethanol. The residue can also be \nused as fertilizer due to its high \nnutrition content. The composition of \nthis solid residue varies depending on \nthe variety of grapes, but it is mainly \nconstituted by tannins, organic acids, \nreducing sugars, nitrogen compounds, \nanthocyans, wax, inorganic salts and \nlipids [1], and rest of vegetal cell walls \n(pectin, cellulose, hemicellullose and \nmainly lignine).   \nThe extraction of valuable com-\npounds from this raw material is \nperformed on several ways depending \non the target compounds to be \nextracted: anthocyans are extracted by \nusing as extractant either sulphur \ndioxide or sorbent resins [2]; seeds are \npreviously separated and smashed and \nthe oil is extracted by using hexane as \nsolvent [3]; tannins are extracted with \nhot water and then precipitated with \nNaCl;4 meanwhile simple phenolics \n(hy-droxylated and methoxylated \nbenzoic acids, cinnamic acid and \nderivatives and catechins) have been \nextracted by soaking with organic \nsolvents [5, 6]. \nWhen extraction is performed in the \nabsence of  both  light  and  air,  degra-\ndation and oxidation processes are \nsignificantly reduced in comparison \nwith other extraction techniques, and \nthe extracts obtained are richer in \nvaluable compounds. This is the main \nadvantage of using subcritical or \nsupercritical fluids and one of the \nreasons for developing extraction \nprocesses in this way.       \nSupercritical and subcritical fluid \nextraction has been proposed using \ncarbon dioxide and adding organic \nmodifiers to increase the polarity of the \nfluid for the extraction of phenolic \ncompounds [7,8], but the costs of the \nmethods at an industrial scale are high. \nThe stability of phenolic compounds \nunder subcritical conditions up to \n150\u00baC using methanol as extractant has \nbeen studied by Palma et al. [9] to \nprove the feasibility of extracting \nphenolic compounds from solid \nresidues from the winemaking process \nwith pressurised liquids. Although the \nresults were satisfactory, the use of this \nsolvent presents two main short-\ncomings: the cost of methanol and its \nhigh toxicity, which involves a \nsubsequent step for removal of the \nextractant before human use.  \nSubcritical water extraction of \nessential oils from aromatic plants is \nvery promising [10,11]. It has prompted \nthe development of an alternative to the \nconventional manual methods based on \norganic solvents. The use of super-\nheated ethanol-water mixtures has \npreviously been checked for the \nextraction of phenolic compounds from \nAnal. Bioanal. Chem., (2003) 377: 1190-1195 \n \n 3\noak wood [12,13]. The extracts \nobtained were compared with \ncommercial wood extracts with an \nexcellent agreement concerning \ncomposition, and with drastic reduction \nof both time and costs.   \nDue to the nature of the compounds \nthat can be found in solid residues \ncoming from winemaking processes, \nthe use of superheated water or \nmixtures of water and ethanol could be \nsuitable for the extraction of such com-\npounds. The aim of this work is the \nstudy of a leaching step for these \nresidues using superheated water or \neither ethanol-water mixtures on the \nlight of the individual separation of the \nextracted species by liquid or gas \nchromatography or the monitoring of \nthe whole extract by a photometric \ndetector. \n \nExperimental \n \nInstruments and apparatus \nThe laboratory-made extractor used, \nshown in Fig. 1, consists of the \nfollowing parts: a Knauer 64 high \npressure pump (Knauer, Berlin, \nGermany), used to propel the extractant \nliquid through the system; a stainless \nsteel cylindrical extraction chamber \n(150 x11 mm id, 14 ml internal \nvolume) which was closed with screws \nat both ends in order to permit its filling \nwith extractant and emptying of the \nextract. The screw caps also contained \nstainless steel filters plates (2 mm thick, \nand 6.35 mm i.d.) to ensure the wood \nchips remained in the extraction \nchamber. This chamber, together with a \nstainless steel preheater, was located in \na gas chromatograph oven (HP 5720A, \nHewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE, \nUSA) used as heating source capable to \nwork up to 400\u00baC.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Extraction system. hpp: high \npressure pump, er: extractant reservoir, ph: \npre-heater, ec: extraction cell, o: oven, c: \ncooler, v1=selection valve, v2=restriction \nvalve.  \n \nA loop made from 1-m length \nstainless-steel tubing and cooled with \nwater at room temperature was used to \ncool the extract from the oven to a \ntemperature close to 25\u00baC. A pressure \nneedle valve coupled to the outlet of the \ncooler and a selecting valve located \nbetween the high-pressure pump and \nthe oven allowed flushing of the extract \nwith N2 after extraction. \nThe liquid chromatography ana-\nlyses of the extracts were performed \nusing a modular 1100 Hewlett-Packard \nliquid chromatograph (Pittsburg, PA, \nUSA), consisting of a G1311A high \npressure quaternary pump, a G1322A \nJ. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al                                      \n \n 4 \nvacuum degasser, a 7725 Rheodyne \nhigh-pressure manual injection valve \n(HPIV) and a G1315A diode array \ndetector. The individual separation of \nthe components both from the extracts \nand standard solutions was performed \non a 250 mm x 4.6 mm id, 5 \u03bcm \nparticle, Hypersil ODS column \n(Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) \nprotected by a precolumn of the same \nmaterial.  \nThe gas chromatography analyses \nof the extracts were performed using a \nVarian 3900 gas chromatograph equip-\nped with a Chrompack capillary CP-\nWax 57 CB fused silica column (50 m \nx 0.25 mm id, 0.2 \u03bcm film thickness) \nand a flame ionisation detector (FID). \nFinally, a Saturn 2200 mass spectro-\nmeter (Varian) equipped with a \nChrompack capillary CP-Sil 8 CB fused \nsilica column (50 m x 0.25 mm i.d.) \nwas used to characterise the com-\npounds. A Cary 50 Conc spectro-\nphotometer from Varian (Mulgrave, \nAustralia), connected to a computer \nwith Cary WinUV v.2.0\u00ae (Varian) \nsoftware for data collection and \ntreatment, was also used for photo-\nmetric monitoring of the extracts. \nAll the extracts were centrifuged \nusing a Selecta (Barcelona, Spain) \nMixtasel centrifuge and filtered through \n0.45 \u03bcm Minisart filters from Sartorius \n(G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). A vacuum pump \n(Vac Elut SPS 24, Varian, P.S. \nAnalytical, England) was used for \nfiltering the HPLC solvents. Statistical \ntreatments were made using Statgraph-\nics\u2122 plus 2.1. for Windows. \n \nReagents and solutions \nEthanol 96% (v\/v) PA from Panreac \n(Barcelona, Spain) and distilled water \nwere used for preparing the water-\nehanol mixtures used as extractant, with \nethanol contents from 0 to 100%. \nVanillin and gallic, protocatechuic and \nvanillic acids used as chromatographic \nstandards were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. \nLouis, USA). 4-methyl-2-pentanol and \npicolinic acid ethyl ester used as \ninternal standards were from Merck \n(Darmstadt, Germany). Solutions of \nmethanol, acetic acid (both HPLC \ngrade and supplied by Merck) and \nultrapure water at pH 3 were used as \nmobile phases. Methanol and ultrapure \nwater at pH 7.0 were used for \nconditioning and regeneration of the \nchromatographic column. \nUltrapure water obtained from a \nMillipore (Bedfore, MA, USA) Milli-Q \nplus system was also used. The nitrogen \nused for dragging the extract from the \nextraction cell was supplied by Air-\nLiquide (Paris, France). \nSolid residues from winemaking \nprocess (SRWP) were provided by \nP\u00e9rez Barquero Winery (Montilla, \nC\u00f3rdoba) from the 2002 vintage. \n \nProcedures \n \nSubcritical extraction  \nThe sample cell in Fig. 1 was filled \nwith 1.5 g of SRWP, and two pieces of \nAlbet 235 filter paper were inserted at \nboth ends of the cell to prevent the frit \nfrom clogging. After assembling the \nextraction cell in the oven, this was \nbrought up to the working temperature \nAnal. Bioanal. Chem., (2003) 377: 1190-1195 \n \n 5\n(200\u00baC) and pressurised up to 40 atm \nwith water-ethanol solution, by main-\ntaining valve v2 closed. Once the \nsystem was pressurised, valve v1 was \nclosed and a static extraction was \ndeveloped for 60 min. After this, v1 was \nturned to the open position to allow \nnitrogen to flow through the cell by \nopening valve v2; then, collecting the \nextract in a vial at room temperature. \n \nChromatographic separation and \ndetection \nFor the optimisation study 2-\u03bcL \naliquots of the extract were injected \ninto the chromatograph in the (1:15) \nsplit mode. The flow-rate of the carrier \ngas (helium) was 1.1 mL min-1; the \ninjector and detector temperatures were \nset at 270\u00ba C; the oven temperature \nprogram was:  40\u00baC (5 min), 40\u00baC to \n200 \u00baC (4\u00baC min-1), 200\u00baC (40 min).  \nFor characterisation of the volatile \nfraction of the extract, an aliquot of 1 \n\u03bcL of extract was injected into the \nchromatograph\/mass spectrometer in \nthe splitless mode. The carrier gas \n(helium) flow-rate was 1 mL min-1; \ninjector and detector temperatures were \nset at 270 and 300\u00baC, respectively; the \noven temperature program was: 40\u00baC (5 \nmin), 40\u00baC to 200 \u00baC (6\u00baC min-1), 200\u00baC \n(20 min), 200\u00baC to 275\u00baC (10\u00baC min-1). \nFor characterisation of the poly-\nphenol fraction 20 \u03bcL of the extract was \ninjected into the liquid chromatograph. \nThe elution was performed in isocratic \nmode, a flow rate of 0,3 mL min-1, with \na mobile phase consisting of 10:90 \nmethanol\/water corrected at pH 3 by \nusing the proper amount of acetic acid. \nThe absorption wavelengths were set at \n280 and 310 nm and UV spectra in the \nrange 220-360 nm were also recorded. \nThe chromatographic peaks were \nidentified by comparing their retention \ntimes and UV spectra with those from \nthe reference compounds. \n \nResults and discussion \n \nA static approach was tested for the \nextraction of compounds from SRWP \nin order to enlarge the sample-\nextractant contact, thus favouring the \nattainment of the partition equilibrium.  \n \nOptimisation of variables \nThe variables affecting subcritical \nextraction were studied in order to \nmaximise the yield of compounds \nextracted from SRWP in a time as short \nas possible. With this aim, a \nmultivariate approach was used for \noptimising the physical variables \naffecting the extraction, and a \nunivariate approach was used for \nstudying the influence on the extraction \nof the ethanol percent in the extraction \nmixture. The amount of sample used \n(1.5 g) was that necessary to fill the \nextraction cell. The range over which \nthe variables were studied and the \noptimum values found are given in \nTable 1. \nA multivariate approach was used \nfor the optimisation of the extraction \ntime and temperature within the ranges \n10-70 min and 80-250 \u00baC, respectively. \nThe pressure was that required for \nmaintaining the extractant in liquid \nstate. As the vapour pressures of \nJ.

The \nchromatographic areas of three \noutstanding compounds characteristic \nof this kind of residues (namely, \nvanillin, gallic and acetic acids) was the \ndependent variable.\n \nTable 1.

The \nsignal increased when the time and \ntemperature were increased but with a \nhigher effect from the former. A time of  \n65 min and a temperature of 210\u00ba C \nwere selected as optimum. Tempera-\ntures higher than this were not used in \norder to avoid cleavage and oxidation \nreactions of some of the extracted \ncompounds [13,14]. \nSince the P-value in the ANOVA \ntable is lower than 0.05%, there is a \nstatistically significant relationship \nbetween the variables at a 95% \nconfidence level. The equation of the \nmodel chosen in the optimisation is: \nArea= 1658 \u2013 325 T + 160 t + 0.751 T 2 \n+ 1.4 T t \u2013 1.55 t 2, where \nT=temperature and t=time. The amount \nof ethanol in the extractant was studied \nby the univariate method in the range 0-\n100%(v\/v). It was found that maximum \nextraction of some compounds \u2212e.g. \nprotocatechuic acid\u2212 was achieved by \nincreasing the ethanol concentration, as \nexpected, but the concentration of some \nother compounds such as vanillin and \ngallic and vanillic acids decreased. \nOther compounds, such as acetic acid, \nwere not affected by changes in the \nextractant composition. This behaviour \nwas checked by both liquid chromato-\ngraphy (Fig. 2) and gas chroma-\ntography (Fig. 3). On the other hand, \nphotometric monitoring of the extract \n(Fig. 4) showed an increase of the \nabsorbance at 280 nm by increasing the \nethanol content, which can be attributed \nto increase of polyphenol contents in \nthe extract.

Figure 5 shows the HPLC \nchromatograms of two extracts obtain-\ned by using water at pH 10 (a) and 2 \n(b). As expected, low pHs favour the \nextraction of the target compounds in \ngeneral and that of polyphenols in \nparticular (Fig. 6). This was also the \nbehaviour of some of the components \nin the volatile fraction as shown by the \ngas chromatograms (Fig. 7).

From \n1.5 g of SRWP, 0.195 g of oil was \nobtained, which was constituted mainly \nby linoleic, estearic, oleic and palmitic \nacids and their esters. The aqueous \nphase was rich in polyphenols, fibre \nand proteins. Proteins and fibre \nprecipitate over a time after extraction \nand are removed by filtration. The \nvolatile fraction of the extract obtained  \n \n \n \nusing the optimum working conditions \nwas characterised by GC\/MS. As can \nbe observed in Fig. 8, the majority of \ncompounds in SRWP are volatile \nphenols and fatty acids. Scarce \ndifferences were found in the volatile \nfraction when extracts from seeds or the \noverall SRWP were subjected to \nGC\/MS. This denotes a low contri-\nbution of peels and shoots to this \nfraction. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

Table 2 shows \nthe values for the Total Polyphenols \nIndex and the peak areas from the \nHPLC chromatograms, referred to the \ninternal standard (picolinic acid ethyl \nester), from two of the most outstanding \ncompounds (namely, gallic acid and \nvanillin). The extractions were perform-\ned in three cycles using ethanol\/water \nmixtures with a 10, 30, 50% of ethanol \ncontent. The extraction percentages for \nthe two compounds ranged between 55-\n65% for the first cycle, 15-20% for the \nsecond, 5-15% for the third.  \nJ.

Subcritical extraction pres-\nents a number of advantages as \ncompared with conventional alter-\nnatives, namely: significant  saving of \norganic solvents, possibility of manipu-\nlating the composition of the extracts \nby changing the extraction parameters, \nlower toxicity, lower costs, safer \nextraction processes and a simpler \ntechnology.  \n \n \nThe results of the GC\/MS, \nHPLC\/UV detection and GC\/FID \nchromatograms from the extract have \nshown that some valuable compounds \ncan be obtained from the extracts with a \nhigh yield. The studies performed have \nshown that most of the outstanding \nvolatile and non-volatile compounds \ncan be extracted with only two \nextraction cycles in percentages ranging \nfrom 75 to 95%, which makes feasible \nindustrial exploitation.   \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe Spanish Comisi\u00f3n Interministerial \nde Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CICyT) is \nthanked for financial support (Project \nAGL2000-0321-P4-03).\n  \nBibliography \n \n(1) C.
