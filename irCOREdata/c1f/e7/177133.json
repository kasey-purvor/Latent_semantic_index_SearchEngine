Despite this lack of\nevidence, at least 80 hospitals across the UK have\nnow developed such follow-up services in an attempt\nto improve outcomes after discharge.23 Despite UK\nguidelines, the nature of these programmes varies\nmarkedly between centres, and no optimal model has\nbeen identified.23 24Given thewidespread proliferation\nof these programmes, it is crucial that their effective-\nness is established without delay. We formally tested\nthe hypothesis that nurse led follow-up programmes\nare effective at improving physical and psychological\nhealth related quality of life in the year after discharge\nfrom intensive care.\n1Department of Critical Care\nMedicine, Sunnybrook Health\nSciences Centre, Toronto\n2School of Nursing and Midwifery,\nUniversity of Dundee, Dundee\n3Health Services Research Unit,\nUniversity of Aberdeen, Aberdeen\nAB32\n4Intensive Care Unit, Royal\nBerkshire and Battle Hospital,\nReading\n5Intensive Care Unit, Aberdeen\nRoyal Infirmary, Aberdeen\n6Department of Mental Health,\nMurray Royal Hospital, Perth\n7Robertson Centre for\nBiostatistics, University of\nGlasgow, Glasgow\n8Health Economics Research Unit,\nUniversity of Aberdeen\n9Health Psychology Unit,\nUniversity of Aberdeen\n10Department of Anaesthesia and\nIntensive Care Medicine,\nNinewells Hospital and Medical\nSchool, Dundee\nCorrespondence to: B H\nCuthbertson\nbrian.cuthbertson@sunnybrook.ca\nCite this as: BMJ 2009;339:b3723\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.b3723\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 8\nMETHODS\nParticipants and treatment allocation\nPatients were recruited from three UK hospitals (two\nteaching hospitals and one district general hospital)\nfrom September 2006 until October 2007. All patients\nreceiving level 3 dependency (intensive care unit) care\nat any time during their hospital stay andwho survived\nuntil hospital discharge were eligible for inclusion in\nthe trial.24 Patients less than 18 years old, not expected\nto survive to leave hospital, unable to complete ques-\ntionnaires or attend clinics, and who did not consent to\nparticipate were excluded. Patients were approached\nin the period after discharge from intensive care\nwhen they were able to give informed consent. Before\nthe participants\u2019 randomisation, we recorded their\nbaseline measurements, quality of life (with the SF-36\n(short form 36) and EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaires),\nintensive care experience (ICE score), and mood dis-\norder (HADS (hospital anxiety and depression scale)\nscore).9 25-27 Patients were randomised to intervention\nor control in a non-blinded fashion using a compu-\nterised telephone randomisation service which incor-\nporated minimisation by age, sex, HADS score,\nseverity of disease (APACHE II (acute physiology,\nage, and chronic health evaluation) score), ICE\nscore,9 and trial centre.\nIntervention\nPatients randomised to the intervention joined a man-\nual based, self directed, physical rehabilitation pro-\ngramme developed by physiotherapists and\nintroduced by a study nurse. This started in hospital\nand continued for three months after discharge.\nPatientsmonitored their own compliance and progress\nwith the manual treatments and were formally\nreviewed at nurse led clinics at three months and nine\nmonths after discharge. The timing and format of this\nintervention was determined by the results of a survey\nof clinical practice conducted by our group, a national\nsurvey, and a national guideline,11 23 24 as well as experi-\nences of intensive care follow-up from one of the trial\ncentres. The nurses followed a set format with standar-\ndised intervention and assessment requirements. An\nintensive care consultant was immediately available\nfor support or to assess the patients for onward referral\nto other medical services and on patient request.\nClinic appointments had the following components:\nstructured case review, discussion of experiences of\nintensive care, formal assessment of requirement for\nspecialist medical referral, and screening for psycholo-\ngical morbidity relating to admission to the intensive\ncare unit (using the Davidson trauma score and\nHADS).27 28 Patients with \u201ccaseness\u201d or in whom\nthere was clinical concern were referred for review by\na mental health professional, review of current drug\ntreatment, visit to the intensive care unit if appropriate,\nand physiotherapy if appropriate, and a review letter\non the patient\u2019s progresswas sent to each patient\u2019s gen-\neral practitioner. For more details of the intervention,\nsee protocol paper.29\nAll interventions and referrals used standard NHS\npathways. The exception was for psychological ser-\nvices, for which we developed assured referral path-\nways owing to the lack of identifiable clinical\npathways for this patient group. The intervention was\nrigorously applied in each centre to avoid dependence\non the aptitude of individual nurses. Trial nurses were\ntrained together by nurses who carried out intensive\ncare follow-up to ensure standardisation.\nThe \u201cstandard care\u201d group had follow-up in accor-\ndance with standard clinical practice with no intensive\ncare follow-up after hospital discharge. They were fol-\nlowed up by their general practitioners and primary\nhospital specialty as indicated by these teams.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome measures were health related\nquality of life (HRQoL) scores at 12 months measured\nwith the SF-36 questionnaire by means of a postal sur-\nvey. Secondary outcomes included HRQoL at six\nmonths, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at\n12 months, incidence and severity of post-traumatic\nstress disorder (Davidson trauma score) and anxiety\nand depression (using HADS) at six and 12 months,\ncost effectiveness at 12months, primary and secondary\nhealthcare costs in the year after hospital discharge,\nandmortality in the 12months after discharge.

The researchers handling the outcome sur-\nveys were blinded to the intervention group.\nSample size\nPrevious studies have shown the intensive care patients\nhad a mean physical component score of the SF-36 of\n35 (SD 14) at one year after discharge from intensive\ncare.2Wepowered the study to detect a effect size of a 5\npoint increase on the SF-36 physical component score\n(about a 0.36 effect size) in the intervention group at\none year. This suggested that 123 patients per group\nwere required to complete the one year outcome mea-\nsure to detect this difference with 80% power and an \u03b1\nof 0.05. However, the analysis was planned to adjust\nfor baseline measurement and that the correlation\nbetween baseline, three month, and 12 month SF-36\nscores was 0.6 (as had been seen in other studies of\nhealth related quality of life2), implying a sample size\nreduction of 36% was feasible. A conservative reduc-\ntion of 30% in the estimated sample size could be\nachieved without a concomitant loss of power. There-\nfore, we required only 86 patients per group to com-\nplete the one year outcome measure. Assuming a 20%\nloss to follow-up27 9 and a further 20% mortality in the\nfirst year, the total number of patients needed to be\nrecruited into the study was estimated as 135 per\ngroup.\nThe primary analyses were based on the principle of\nintention to treat. The outcomes were compared\nbetween the groups using analysis of covariance,\nadjusting for minimisation factors and the baseline\nmeasurement of the outcome variable (with the excep-\ntion of theDavidson trauma score, whichwas notmea-\nsured at baseline), with two tailed P<0.05.\nDichotomous outcomes were analysed using logistic\nregression. A priori subgroup analyses of the primary\noutcome were undertaken for APACHE II severity of\nillness, APACHE II comorbidity, intensive care\nexperience (ICE score), and length of stay in intensive\ncare, using tests for treatment by subgroup interaction\n(two tailed P<0.01).Datawere analysed using SASver-\nsion 9.1 software. Sensitivity analyses were also under-\ntaken around the primary outcomemeasures using the\ntreatment received and per protocol methods. Patients\nwere considered to have received the treatment if they\nattended at least one of the two clinics. Sensitivity ana-\nlysis for loss to follow-upwas performedusingmultiple\nimputation methods. Results are presented as effect\nsizes and odds ratios where relevant with confidence\nintervals.\nEconomic analysis\nCost per participant for each arm of the trial was calcu-\nlated. We estimated use of healthcare resources per\npatient bymeans of patient questionnaires andhospital\nnote reviewover the first year.Unit costs or priceswere\nobtained using published estimates30-32 and study-spe-\ncific estimates. QALYs were calculated using the area\nunder the curve method with responses to the EQ-5D\nquestionnaire valued using UK population tariffs.25\nPatients who died were assigned a zero utility weight\nfrom their death to the end of the follow-up. QALYs\nbefore death were calculated using linear extra-\npolation. Point estimates for mean costs and mean\nQALYs were derived for treatment and standard\ngroups to obtain incremental cost per QALY gained.\nDeterministic and stochastic sensitivity analyses\n(based on bootstrapped estimates) addressed different\ntypes of uncertainties within the economic evaluation,\nsuch as the exploration of the effect of those partici-\npants with the greatest costs on the estimates of mean\ncost effectiveness.\nRESULTS\nBaseline characteristics showed that groups were well\nbalanced in respect of key prognostic variables\n(table 1).

Table 3 presents the\nresults of the sensitivity analyses for the primary out-\ncome measure (10 patients in the intervention group\ndid not attend either of the nurse led clinics and so\nwere deemed to have not had the intervention): these\nshowed a slight increase in the observed effect sizes for\nthe primary outcomes, but they remained non-signifi-\ncant. Fig 2 shows the a priori subgroup analyses.\nAt six and 12 months after discharge from intensive\ncare, similar percentages of patients in each group had\nreturned to work (at six months, 40% (16\/40) of inter-\nvention group v 37% (15\/41) of controls, odds ratio\n1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.43 to 3.12); at\n12 months, 56% (18\/32) v 55% (17\/31); odds ratio\n1.06 (0.35 to 3.21)). Likewise, similar percentages of\npatients in each group had seen their general practi-\ntioner (at 6 months, 90% (92\/102) v 89% (98\/110),\nodds ratio 1.13 (0.42 to 3.06); at 12 months, 82% (75\/\n92) v 88% (85\/97), odds ratio 0.62 (0.25 to 1.49)). There\nwere also no significant differences in satisfaction rates\nbetween groups (data not shown). There were no ser-\nious adverse events in either group.\nThe mean cost of care was \u00a37126 for the intervention\ncompared with \u00a34810 for standard care (difference\n\u00a32316 (95% credible interval \u2212\u00a3269 to \u00a34363)). The\nmean total QALY was 0.423 in the intervention group\nversus 0.426 in the control group (difference \u22120.003\n(\u22120.065 to 0.060)). The difference in cost was significant\nat the 5% level, but the difference in QALYs was not.\nBased on the bootstrapped estimates of cost effective-\nness, it is unlikely that follow-upprogrammes after inten-\nsive care are cost effective at typical threshold values for\nsociety\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY. The sensitivity\nanalysis revealed that the results of the study were not\naffected by loss to follow-up.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study is the first randomised controlled trial of a\nnurse led follow-up programme over the year after dis-\ncharge from intensive care. It achieved its target sam-\nple size, and the intervention was reliably delivered.\nThe outcomemeasures included both general and spe-\ncific measures of health related quality of life andmen-\ntal health and were appropriate to the research\nquestions asked. The intervention was not effective in\nimproving health related quality of life in the year after\ndischarge from intensive care with regard to the out-\ncome measures. The intervention also did not show\neffectiveness in any of the a priori subgroups, which\nincluded severity of illness, chronic comorbidity,\nintensive care experience, and length of stay in inten-\nsive care.\nWe believe that this study has high internal validity.\nThe study recruited from three centres, one of which\nhad an existing follow-up service and two that did not.\nThe expert centre taught the other centres in the deliv-\nery of the intervention. The patients recruited to the\ntrial are broadly representative of UK intensive care\nadmissions.1 However, those included in our study\nwere likely to have beenmore severely ill than patients\nadmitted to intensive care in other countries as our\npatients represented level 3 dependency care or the\nrequirement for support of multiorgan failure.24 This\nmay affect the external validity and generalisability of\nthe result.

Markers of this include that more than\n90% of patients had the main elements of the inter-\nvention delivered. Despite encouragement to do so,\nonly a minority of patients brought a relative with\nthem to the clinic.With the key role of relatives in deli-\nvering care, we were surprised this number was not\nhigher. Also, about a third of the patients required spe-\ncialist medical referrals and a further third psychologi-\ncal referral. These data reflect the high, and\npresumably often unmet, need for specialist care in\nthis patient group. Intensive care doctors were\ninvolved in the care of up to half of the patients at the\nclinics, mainly at the request of the nurses rather than\nof the patients, andwere involved in all specialist refer-\nrals. The vastmajority of patients were offered a visit to\nthe intensive care unit, and three quarters took up this\noffer independently of the clinic appointment. From\nthese data it is clear that the intervention was coordi-\nnated at the clinics but was delivered across the entire\nfirst year after discharge from the intensive care unit.\nLosses to the study over the first year were due to\ndeaths (11.2%), withdrawal, and loss to follow-up\n(21.7%). Suchmortality figures are in keepingwith pre-\nvious reports from similar patient cohorts.2 34 A 20%\nwithdrawal or loss to follow-up is also broadly in keep-\ning with other studies in this patient cohort.2 34 How-\never, we performed sensitivity analysis to analyse the\neffects of such losses to follow-up, which showed that\nthe results were not affected by such losses.\nTable 3 | Primary outcome of trial of a nurse led rehabilitation programme for patients discharged from intensive care.\nResults were analysed on the basis of intention to treat (adjusted for minimisation covariates*), per protocol, and the\ntreatment received\nSF-36 score at 12 months\nIntervention Standard care Effect size\n(95% CI) P valueNo of patients Mean(SD)score No of patients Mean(SD)score\nIntention to treat analysis\nPhysical component score 90 42.0 (10.6) 97 40.8 (11.9) 1.1 (\u22121.9 to 4.2) 0.46\nMental component score 90 47.1 (12.7) 97 46.8 (12.4) 0.4 (\u22123.0 to 3.7) 0.83\nPer protocol analysis\nPhysical component score 80 42.3 (10.8) 97 40.8 (11.9) 1.6 (\u22121.6 to 4.8) 0.33\nMental component score 80 48.5 (11.8) 97 46.8 (12.4) 1.7 (\u22121.7 to 5.1) 0.33\nTreatment received analysis\nPhysical component score 80 42.3 (10.8) 107 40.7 (11.7) 1.7 (\u22121.4 to 4.8) 0.27\nMental component score 80 48.5 (11.8) 107 45.8 (13.0) 2.6 (\u22120.8 to 6.0) 0.14\n*Minimisation covariates were age, sex, HADS score, APACHE II score, ICE score, and trial centre (see table 1 for definitions of abbreviations).\nTable 4 | Secondary outcome measures of trial of a nurse led rehabilitation programme for patients discharged from\nintensive care.

As above, nearly a third of these patients\nrequired psychological referral, and ready access to\nsuch care is simply not available currently in the UK.\nClearly, despite the results of this study, more needs to\nbe done to identify patients with significant morbidity\nand suitable assessment and treatment options put in\nplace.\nAs part of a sensitivity analysis, we analysed the pri-\nmary outcomes according to treatment received and\nper protocol. These analyses show a slight increase in\nthe intervention effect, but it remained non-significant.\nThis may suggest that greater penetration of the inter-\nvention contributes to an improved outcome but will\nnot on its own bring about important improvements.\nSubgroup analyses also did not yield any notable dif-\nferences between intervention and control groups.\nAkeypart of the economic evaluationwas to explore\nunder what circumstances the conclusions would alter.\nThis was undertaken using sensitivity analysis but the\nresults remained robust to different underlying\nassumptions. Furthermore, given that therewas no evi-\ndence of differences in QALYs, follow-up pro-\ngrammes could only be cost effective if they had the\nsame or lower cost than standard care. This seems\nimplausible over a 12 month follow-up period given\nthe data we have. However, for the average difference\nin cost of \u00a32316, follow-up programmeswould need to\nprovide 0.12 QALYs above standard care over a\n12 month period to have an incremental cost per\nQALY of \u00a320 000. This value is well above the upper\nlimit of the 95% credible interval obtained in the base\ncase or any of the sensitivity analyses.\nThere may be a variety of reasons why an improve-\nment in health related quality of life was not observed\nin this study. Firstly, our complex interventionpackage\nmay truly be ineffective. The intervention was devel-\noped from the experiences of an existing intensive care\nfollow-up programme with many years experience,\nwith additional regard to current UK practice in this\nfield and with detailed knowledge of the morbidity\nthat occurs in the year after discharge from intensive\ncare.2 7 9 However, although well informed, these fol-\nlow-up programmes are not strongly evidence based.\nA further reason may be that our intervention did not\naccount for important aspects of a patient\u2019s illness such\nas delirium and cognitive dysfunction and the com-\nplexity of the role of patients\u2019 relatives in their recovery\n(these aspects have emerged in the literature as impor-\ntant factors in patient recovery since our trial inter-\nvention was designed).35-37 It may be that medical\nreview is always appropriate for such complex patients\nand that a multiprofessional approach is required for\nthis group at all times.\nOur intervention differed from standard UK prac-\ntice in that we included all intensive care patients with\nlevel 3 dependency irrespective of their length of stay\nin intensive care. Many centres invite only those\npatients with longer lengths of stay to their pro-\ngrammes, believing that these patients may gain\ngreater benefit. However, our subgroup analysis did\nnot show a significant treatment effect in patients with\nlonger lengths of stay. Further, patients with short stays\nare known to have significant physical and psychologi-\ncal morbidity after admission to intensive care.\nThe timing of the interventionmayhave contributed\nto the non-significant findings (the first follow-up clinic\nwas held at threemonths after discharge), and different\nresults might have been seen if there had been more\nemphasis on early interventions occurring in hospital\nor in the immediate period after hospital. Our physical\nrehabilitation package did, however, start in hospital\nbut may have been inadequate for the needs of these\npatients. A previous study has suggested that a physical\nrehabilitation programme does improve physical out-\ncome when delivered in hospital after discharge from\nintensive care through to three months after\ndischarge.38 The knowledge of physical rehabilitation\nrequirements after critical illness has advanced since\nwe designed the intervention, with more attention\n\u201315 \u201310 \u20135 0 5 10\nAPACHE II score:\nTotal \u2264 22\nTotal > 22\nCHE score = 0\nCHE score > 0\nICE score:\nFrightening \u2264 15\nFrightening > 15\nIntensive care length of stay:\n\u2264 3 days\n> 3 days\n\u2264 5 days\n> 5 days\nSF-36 mental component score\nAPACHE II score:\nTotal \u2264 22\nTotal > 22\nCHE score = 0\nCHE score > 0\nICE score:\nFrightening \u2264 15\nFrightening > 15\nIntensive care length of stay:\n\u2264 3 days\n> 3 days\n\u2264 5 days\n> 5 days\nSF-36 physical component score\nEffect size (95% CI)\nCHE = chronic health evaluation\nICE = Intensive care evaluation\nFig 2 | A priori subgroup analyses of SF-36 scores (physical\nand mental components) adjusted for minimisation\ncovariates.\nRESEARCH\npage 6 of 8 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nbeing paid to starting rehabilitation while the patient is\nstill in the intensive care unit.39\nElements of our intervention might also have\nstrayed inadvertently into the practice for our control\npatients (that is, contamination across groups might\nhave occurred). However, the data indicate that there\nwere higher referral rates to specialist services in the\nintervention group than the control group (data not\nshown), suggesting that the management of patients\nin the intervention group was indeed different from\nthat in the control group. This gives some reassurance\nthat contamination was minimal. The intervention\neffect was also consistent across the centres, suggesting\nthere was not differential drift of the components of the\nintervention group into the control group across cen-\ntres, whichmight have been expected if contamination\nhad occurred in individual sites.\nFinally, the conduct of the study may have inadver-\ntently impaired the delivery of the intervention.\nAlthough it is often stated that the conduct of a research\nproject can improve the studied outcome through the\nHawthorne effect, itmay be that this was not the case in\nthis study.After the study, the nurseswhodelivered the\nintervention indicated that the completion of detailed\nquestionnaires at the clinic appointments (most of\nwhich were part of the clinical assessment at that time\nas well as of the outcomes assessment at the main out-\ncome points) did sometimes feel intrusive, potentially\nmaking the clinic reviews feel more like a research fol-\nlow-up session rather than a review and treatment ses-\nsion. This may have reduced the effectiveness of the\nintervention.\nStrengths and limitations of study\nStrengths of this study include it being the first multi-\ncentre randomised controlled trial of nurse led follow-\nup of patients over the year after their discharge from\nintensive care.We achieved the target sample size, and\nthe intervention was delivered with high validity. The\noutcomes usedwere robust andwell validated in a vari-\nety of clinical areas.Webelieve the studywasdelivered\nwith high internal reliability. The external validity and\ngeneralisabilitymay be reduced by the high severity of\nillness of patients treated inUK intensive care practice.\nLimitations include a comparatively small sample size\nto detect important changes in less common outcomes,\nincluding some physical and psychological outcomes.\nPatient selection may also have been too inclusive for\nthis study. We selected all patients who had required\nintensive care, but the intervention may have been of\ngreater benefit to more severely ill patients or those\nwho required longer stay in intensive care.\nFuture research\nFurther studies should attempt to identify effective\nways to select patients most likely to benefit from fol-\nlow-up after intensive care. They also need to elucidate\nmore clearly the role of delirium and cognitive dys-\nfunction on recovery and indeed on patients\u2019 ability\nto complete clinical and outcome questionnaires. A\ngreater understanding of the complexity of the role of\npatients\u2019 relatives in their recovery and rehabilitation\nafter critical illness is also required. Finally, the role of\nearly physical rehabilitation based in the intensive care\nunit itself needs to be further explored.36\nConclusions\nOur study showed no evidence that a nurse led follow-\nup programme was effective or cost effective in\nimproving patients\u2019 health related quality of life in\nthe first year after their discharge from intensive care.\nHospitals using intensive care follow-up programmes\nwith a similar model of care should review their prac-\ntice in light of our results.\nMembers of the PRaCTICaL study group were A McDonald, G McPherson,\nCR Ramsay, L Vale, C Pflanz-Sinclair, University of Aberdeen;\nJAW Wildsmith, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee; S Rose,\nBerkshire Healthcare Foundation NHS Trust, Bracknell; and B Williams,\nIntensive Care Society, London.
