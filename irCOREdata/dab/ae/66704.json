This article explores aspects of employment on the Durham Priory estates\nin the years 1494\u20131519. From a perspecti\u008ae of prices and wages, this period belongs\nat the tail end of a Golden Age for labour. Employment opportunities for the priory\nworkforce should, therefore, ha\u008ae been relati\u008aely plentiful and remunerati\u008aely\nrewarding. Howe\u008aer, as an analysis of the priory\u2019s accounts re\u008aeals, whilst wage rates\nremained stable, the waged employment offered was irregular and piecemeal for all\nbut a small, predominantly skilled elite, with the majority of the workforce enjoying\nlittle in the way of fixed employment patterns or identifiable career structures.\nDespite the abiding interest of historians in the nature of employment in\nthe late medieval and early modern periods, attention has been focused\nchiefly on changing levels of wages and standards of living.\" More\nrecently, differences in the remuneration of male and female labour have\ncome to the fore, as a result of exploring in particular the effects of the\nprolonged scarcity of labour that followed the Black Death.# In this\nperspective of prices and wages, the late fifteenth and early sixteenth\ncenturies belong at the tail end of a Golden Age for labour. Although in\nparticular contexts, such as that of York, conditions of employment were\ndeteriorating in the later fifteenth century as a result of industrial\ncompetition, and though the economy of northern England in general\nshowed little sign of economic growth through the period,$ the years\n* Department of History, University of Durham.\n357\nContinuity and Change 16 (3), 2001, 357\u2013378. # 2001 Cambridge Uni\u008aersity Press\nDOI: 10.1017}S0268416001003915 Printed in the United Kingdom\nWork and wages at Durham Priory\nand its estates, 1494\u20131519\nCHRISTINE M. NEWMAN*\nchristine m . newman\n1494\u20131519 nevertheless belong within the high-wage period inaugurated\nby the labour scarcities of the later fourteenth century. Not until prices\nstarted to rise significantly in the third and fourth decades of the sixteenth\ncentury was there any appreciable fall away from the gains made by wage-\nearners in the late Middle Ages.\nBeside the work that has been done on movements of prices and wages,\nother aspects of the late-medieval labour market are under-explored.\nWhilst various broader studies of communities have touched on the\navailability, seasonality, regularity or security of work, few projects have\nhad sufficient information to enter into detailed discussion. In recent years\nPenn and Dyer\u2019s analysis of fourteenth-century evidence relating to the\nenforcement of the Statute of Labourers, together with the studies of Poos\non wages and labour in medieval Essex and of Hassell-Smith on Norfolk\nlabourers in the latter part of the sixteenth century, have all partly\nredressed the balance.% Woodward\u2019s study of northern building labourers,\nsimilarly, is a mine of relevant analysis and information.& The subject,\nhowever, remains starved of analysis that comes close to an understanding\nof the characteristic work experience of employees, chiefly because of the\nscarcity of detailed information about workers in particular market\ncontexts.\u2019 Evidence drawn from the records of Durham Priory goes some\nway to filling this gap since it provides a wealth of detailed information\nregarding the nature of employment on the estates of a great ecclesiastical\nlandlord. This evidence permits the comparison of numerous wage series\nover the period and allows an analysis of the structure of employment\nacross a wide range of tasks. In addition, the identification in the records\nof a considerable number of named employees facilitates the exploration\nof individual working practices. This permits the investigation of a\nnumber of basic questions pertaining to the characteristics of employment\non the priory estates.\nIt has long been acknowledged that the period under consideration was\none of wage stability, with predictably stratified levels of remuneration for\ndifferent tasks. What is not so clear is the extent to which individual\nemployees remained within the bounds of this stratification. To what\nextent were employees, for instance, prepared to accept variable levels of\nremuneration in order to obtain employment? It is well known, too, that\ndifferent employment structures were used for different tasks; the\nemployment of individuals, the employment of individual artisans with\nassistants and the hiring of teams of associates were all regular types of\nemployment contract. However, there has been little discussion of the\nextent to which these forms of labour organization varied between jobs\nand to what extent individuals moved between one type of structure and\nanother. It would also be interesting to identify the extent to which\n358\nwork and wages at durham priory , 1494\u20131519\nemployees had regular expectations about their place in such structures.\nWas a man hired as a principal worker in one job prepared to act in a\nsubordinate capacity in others? These doubts are all related to the larger\nquestion whether the degree of occupational flexibility undermines the\nnotion of a career structure for priory employees. Knowledge of some of\nthese characteristics of the labour market, complementing the evidence of\nhigh wage rates, is necessary to understand just how close the Golden Age\nwas to the experiences and aspirations of wage-earners in more recent\ntimes.\nThe importance of this topic for social historians can hardly be\ndoubted. It has been shown that even wealthier villagers and local\ncraftsmen sometimes undertook waged work when the opportunity\narose.( For those with little property, meanwhile, employment was\nessential to survival, and the character of employment inevitably shaped\ntheir everyday experience. Despite the problems of evidence, a number of\nstudies have already raised some relevant questions and suggested\nhypotheses worth further examination. Historians have, for instance, long\nacknowledged the irregular and diverse nature of such work. It has been\nsuggested, too, that \u2018occupational flexibility \u2019 was often a feature of such\nemployment.) If it proves to be the case that waged employment was,\nindeed, irregular and unreliable, with dependent employees being obliged\nto turn their hands to a number of different occupations as circumstance\ndemanded, this surely must compromise any very rosy interpretation of\nthe working man\u2019s lot.\nThe records of the Cathedral Priory of Durham, upon which this study\nis based, are particularly suited to an exploration of this kind.* The\naccounts of the bursar, from which the greatest quantity of information\nis derived, are available for 22 out of 25 years during the period 1494\u20131519\n(when Thomas Castell was prior).\"! These provide an exceptional\nopportunity to examine wage rates and working practices. In addition, the\nidentification, in the accounts, of a considerable number of employees by\nname creates a rare opportunity to plot the employment record of\nindividuals from year to year. Complementary evidence, although not so\nprolific, survives in the accounts of several other obedientiaries, namely\nthe almoner (available for 15 years in this period),\"\" the hostillar (4\nyears)\"# and the commoner (4 years).\"$ Details of all recorded jobs have\nbeen entered into a database and analysed in order to investigate the\nquestions raised earlier relating to the characteristics of the employment\nmade available by the priory. The priory employed female labour so rarely\nin this period that no comparison of the wage rates or working conditions\nbetween men and women is possible. However, the accounts do allow an\nextended comparison of male wage rates across a wide range of\n359\nchristine m . newman\ndifferentials. The large number and variety of jobs included in the\ndatabase must to some extent circumvent the problem of rigidity that has\nbeen identified as the main problem with data from institutional\naccounts.\"%\nThe city of Durham resembled many a smaller market town.\"& Whilst\nit acted as a service centre for the priory and the episcopal administration,\nit also provided marketing facilities for the rural hinterland. There was no\nsignificant export industry to suffer from native or foreign competition, so\nto that extent the city was spared one of the problems most likely to affect\nurban economies adversely in the later fifteenth century. Rusticity\nencroached upon the urban settlement to the extent that agrarian concerns\nremained an important feature of urban life.\"\u2019 Because of this, townsmen\nwere sometimes employed in agricultural occupations as well as in the\nmore usual urban crafts and trades.\"( The scope of this diversity is clearly\nshown in the type of work undertaken by these individuals for the priory.\nAway from the town, the priory had jurisdiction over a considerable\nnumber of rural vills and townships, both within the county of Durham\nand beyond. Because much of the administration of demesne lands \u2019in\nhand\u2019 was centralized at the priory, there are numerous entries in the\nbursars\u2019 accounts relating to employees engaged upon agricultural tasks,\nalthough building and repair work to rural properties also accounted for\na considerable number of job entries.\nWithin the bursars\u2019 accounts, the bulk of the evidence concerning the\nemployees of the priory is found amongst the expense necessarie and the\nreparaciones sections. The expense necessarie section details a considerable\nbody of widely disparate items of expenditure, including general expenses,\npurchases of various commodities and payments for routine tasks, mostly\npertaining to general maintenance and agriculture, undertaken by a cross-\nsection of employees and officials. The reparaciones deal with specific\npayments made for repairs and improvements to property, both within the\nconfines of the priory and outside in the various vills and townships.\nInformation concerning particular jobs is more detailed in this section of\nthe accounts, since these were not matters of routine, as were those\nitemised in the expense necessarie. Information concerning the priory\u2019s lay\nofficials, some of whom also undertook waged work, is to be found in the\npensiones et stipendia section of the bursars\u2019 accounts. The accounts of the\nalmoner, hostillar and commoner, although much briefer, follow the same\nformat and provide further comparative evidence. There is much\ninformation regarding the names of employees, methods of remuneration,\nwork structures and frequency and types of employment to be drawn from\nthese various sources. From them, it has been possible to build up a\ndetailed picture not only of the nature of employment within the priory\n360\nwork and wages at durham priory , 1494\u20131519\nestates but also of the impact of the priory as an employer within the local\neconomy. Almost 2,500 separate job entries have been identified across\nthe accounts analysed, for the period 1494\u20131519, of which 2,048 provide\ndetails of named employees. The majority of these jobs \u2013 1,650 in\nall \u2013 appeared in the accounts of the bursar. Of these 1,419 involved the\nperformance of waged manual work and the remaining 231 relate to those\nemployees who received expenses for tasks undertaken during the course\nof their duties. Many of the latter, some of whom were priory officials in\nreceipt of a pension or stipend, were engaged upon supervisory or non-\nmanual administrative tasks.\nThose officials who received pensions and stipends stood at the higher\nend of the social scale. The names of the majority of them appeared in the\naccounts of the bursar. Whilst precise numbers varied from account to\naccount, the names of around 60 lay individuals usually appeared, each\nyear, in the pensiones et stipendia section of the bursars\u2019 accounts during\nthe period 1494\u20131519.\") These included the prior\u2019s steward, the clerk of\nthe prior\u2019s exchequer and a number of legal advisors, most of whom were\ndrawn from the ranks of the local or regional gentry. The highest annual\nfee was that of the clerk of the exchequer, at \u00a36 13s 4d. The steward\nreceived \u00a35 a year. Both of these posts were, characteristically, occupied\nby members of the Durham gentry. The income from them was, therefore,\nsupplementary to the recipients \u2019 principal source of livelihood, but the\nsums were both higher and more secure than most wage-earners could\nhope for over the course of a year. John Rakett was the clerk of the\nexchequer for much of the period under consideration, and he was\nsucceeded, by 1515, by Thomas Tempest, who had previously been one of\nthe prior\u2019s legal advisors.\"* Sir William Bulmer, a leading member of\nDurham gentry society, was named in the accounts as steward of the\npriory from 1509 through to his death in 1531. Two men, Richard Wren\nand his successor Peter Barnard, held the office of the bursar\u2019s \u2018exchequer\ncourier \u2019 (cursor scaccarii) during the period in question. This official,\nwhose duties included the collection of the bursar\u2019s revenues, received\nmore modest annual stipends of \u00a31 6s 8d.#! The legal representatives of the\nprior all received retainers of \u00a31 per annum. Some offices within the prior\u2019s\nhousehold, such as those of marshall, cupbearer and carver, were also held\nby members of the gentry.#\" Lower down the scale came other members\nof the prior\u2019s household, such as valets, grooms and cooks, together with\na number of estate officials and one or two local craftsmen. The stipends\nof these lower employees ranged from \u00a31 (the normal annual stipend for\nthe priory\u2019s carters) down to 3s 4d, except for the plumber who received\n\u00a32 a year.## From 1511 the pensiones et stipendia in the bursars\u2019 accounts\nwere augmented by a further section designated stipendia ex no\u008ao,\n361\nchristine m . newman\ndetailing what appeared to be fee increases for various officials, mostly\nvalets, grooms and other members of the prior\u2019s household. These apart,\nthe bulk of the pensions and stipends, particularly those of the leading\nofficials and craftsmen, remained unchanged throughout the period. At\nthe lower end of the scale these annual stipends of \u00a31 6s 8d and below were\nhardly sufficient to provide an adequate livelihood, and so must also be\nregarded as supplementary to other sources of income.#$ Even the highest\nof annual stipends paid to craftsmen, those of the plumbers, would not\nhave constituted an appropriate annual income for a skilled man, and in\nother cases they can have contributed only a minor part of the recipients\u2019\ntotal annual earnings. For carters and plumbers, as for lawyers, annual\nstipends are best regarded as retaining fees to ensure adequate service\nwhen it was required.\nSome of the additional sources of income earned by these priory\nservants can be identified. Amongst the employees who undertook the 231\nadministrative tasks identified in the bursars\u2019 accounts there were some\nwho, in addition to annual stipends, received expenses. These included the\ncursitor of the priory who annually supervised the collection of the lamb\ntithe in Northumberland and several carters who oversaw the collection of\nthe grain tithes in the various Durham vills. Some of these expenses may\ndisguise sources of income. More transparently, some officials in receipt of\nstipends, both craftsmen and estate officials, received wages as well. Their\nfavoured position within the employment hierarchy enabled them to\nundertake waged work in addition to their contractual duties, confirming\nthat their stipends did not represent a full-time contract of service, and\nthey were often among the priory\u2019s highest-paid wage-earners. This is\nmost conspicuous in the case of the plumbers Christopher More, John\nSnaw and Thomas Risley, who featured prominently amongst the bursar\u2019s\nmost regular employees over a number of years. Christopher More was\ncoming to the end of his career by the start of our period, having worked\nfor the priory since at least the early 1480s. His successor, Thomas Risley,\nwas in office by 1497 and was followed in 1505 by John Snaw, who\nappears in the accounts up to 1515. By 1519, one William Snaw,\npresumably a relative, had taken over the official role. Another beneficiary\nof regular additional work was the smith, William Randson, who was\nretained almost across the period, from 1494 to 1515.#% Several priory\nestate officials also undertook waged work. Thomas Falderley, the palliser\n(park-keeper) of Bearpark during the period in question, often received\npayments for agricultural tasks such as mowing, and general estate\nmaintenance in addition to his annual stipend of 13s 4d. Richard Consett\nand his successor George Davison, the bailiffs of Billingham during the\nperiod, both received wages for repair work and agricultural tasks in\n362\nwork and wages at durham priory , 1494\u20131519\naddition to their annual stipend of \u00a31 17s 4d (the 17s 4d being in lieu of\n3 quarters 2 bushels of wheat).#& Few employees of Durham priory, in the\nperiod under consideration, could expect to earn anything approaching a\nliving wage from the priory. Nevertheless, the availability of regular work\nfor this small elite enabled these men to figure prominently amongst the\nfew employees who were able to push their earnings above subsistence\nlevel.#\u2019\nSome apparent employees not in receipt of annual payments were,\nnevertheless, paid expenses for minor managerial responsibilities. Entries\nin this category concerned a variety of tasks. These included the\nsupervision of transporting commodities, such as wine and soap, from the\nport of Newcastle upon Tyne and the making of journeys to various\ndestinations to acquire foodstuffs such as fish and fowl. Since precise\nbreakdowns of expenditure do not appear in the accounts, it is impossible\nto judge the extent to which such men were receiving remuneration under\ncover of reimbursement of expenses, or just what their form of\nremuneration might be. Meanwhile, most priory employees were wage-\nearners, though modes of payment varied. Many tasks were simply paid\nby the job, with a breakdown of payments being given in the accounts. In\nothers, payment was made to an individual or a group of workmen in\ngrosso, presumably in accordance with some agreement based upon a\ncosting for the job as a whole and possibly inclusive of materials costs. In\n1505, for instance, John Hight and Robert Forman received together \u00a31\n4s 10d in gross of the bursar for walling and daubing gables and clay\nchimneys, together with thatching and cutting timber for a cottage in\nWolviston. In 1508, Thomas Wylly, John Hadok and William Bromidon\nwere similarly paid \u00a35 6s 8d in gross for making fosses (ditches) at\nHeworth with \u2018stakes and ricez [rushes] \u2019, together with cutting of the same\nand all carriage.#( Unfortunately, since the records do not elaborate upon\nthe procedure for the making of such agreements, it is not clear with\nwhom in the priory administration the workmen had agreed their terms.#)\nOther employees, often craftsmen, were paid piece rates. In 1500, for\ninstance, John Anderson was paid \u00a32 2s for making 13 rods of new stone\nroofing at 4s per rod. The actual job payment did not include materials\nsince Anderson received a further payment of \u00a33 13s 9d for 59 waggon\nloads of tiles at ls 3d a load.#* Other jobs were paid by weekly or daily\nrates, and only in these cases is it possible to compare rates of\nremuneration between different occupations, though the other references\nare valuable for other aspects of the analysis. Diversity of forms of\npayment was neither new nor unique to Durham.$!\nIn the bursars\u2019 accounts for the period 1494\u20131519, only 41 jobs were\npaid at a weekly rate, and most of the instances related to carpentry work.\n363\nchristine m . newman\nPayment by the day was much more common. In the bursars\u2019 accounts,\nentries relating to 370 jobs give details of daily wage rates. More evidence\ncan be found in the accounts of the almoner, the hostillar and the\ncommoner which, together, provide details of a further 143 jobs in this\ncategory. The bulk of the tasks paid by the day (300 out of the 370 in the\nbursars\u2019 accounts and almost all those in the accounts of other\nobedientiaries) involved construction and repair work upon the numerous\nproperties that were held by the obedientiaries. Masonry work, wall\nconstruction and repair, daubing and plastering, pointing, carpentry,\nglazing, plumbing, roof-tiling, thatching and general labouring tasks all\nfeatured, together with a number of allied tasks. These included the\nquarrying and transportation of stone, the gathering of ling (heather) and\ndrawing of straw for thatching purposes and the preparation of the\nwattles and spars used in wall construction. The remainder of the day\nwork pertained to agricultural tasks such as mowing, haymaking and\nploughing and to general estate maintenance, which included jobs such as\nditching, fencing repairs and the clearing out of wells, springs and mill\nponds.\nPayments for all of these tasks were generally enumerated in the\naccounts in cash terms although evidence from the bursars \u2019 rent books\nsuggests that, in the cases of a number of employees, part of their\nremuneration was paid over as allowances against rent dues owed. This\nwas an administration in which payments in kind for rents owed still\nfeatured, although an analysis of the rent book of 1495\u20131496 has shown\nthat cash transactions predominated. In 1495\u20131496 some 61 tenants, out\nof an approximate total of around 500, paid some, or part, of their rent\ndues in labour, although numbers seem to have declined as the period\nprogressed.$\" Fee payments to a number of the bursar\u2019s officials were,\nsimilarly, allocated in this fashion. However, since the majority of those\nemployees identified as tenants of the bursar appear to have paid their\nrents in cash, it seems likely that most were paid in monetary form.\nIt is clear, from the evidence shown in Table 1, that, in common with\nwages generally in this period, those of the Durham Priory employees\nremained stable during the period in question. Northern wage rates barely\naltered from the 1460s through to the 1540s.$# The Statute of Labourers\nlaid down separate lower rates of pay for those employees receiving \u2018meat\nand drink\u2019 as part of their remuneration. Occasionally some evidence of\n\u2018board and lodge\u2019 payments emerges. In the Bursar\u2019s Rent Book of\n1495\u20131496, there are a few instances of carriers being provided with\nboard, presumably at harvest time. Similarly, ale was provided at\nploughing time in the priory vill of Billingham, in south-east Durham.

In the main,\n365\nchristine m . newman\nhowever, such evidence is rare and seems to represent an unusual\narrangement. The wages stipulated in the Act of 1495 were lower than\nthose usually received by the Durham Priory employees, which again\nsuggests that provision of meat, drink and board was not, generally,\nincluded.$% This is in keeping with the findings for other northern towns.$&\nTable 1 illustrates the hierarchy of wage rates across the period under\ndiscussion as far as it can be illustrated from daily wage rates stated or\nimplied in the priory accounts. The number of job entries represents a\nlarger number of actual hirings, since each job more often than not\ninvolved several men. The top category notes activities that were paid 5d\nor 6d a day. In Durham, as elsewhere, plumbing headed the wage\nschedule.$\u2019 In most years, plumbers could command 6d for themselves\nand 4d for their famuli (a term which, in the Durham context, seems to\nhave referred to subordinates who possessed a greater degree of experience\nor skill than mere servants). In the years 1513\u20131515 the wages of the\nplumber, John Snaw, dropped to 5d, with 3d for his famuli for reasons\nwhich are not explained, but which may have had something to do with\nthe performance of Snaw himself. This dip did not, however, remove\nplumbers from the top echelon of wage-earners. Skilled masons could\nsometimes command these top rates, although few are mentioned in the\naccounts. In 1498, for instance, Robert Galon and Robert Thomson, both\ndescribed as masons, were paid 6d each, and their famuli 4d, for repairing\nthe mill warren of Shields Mill.$( Slightly lower wages were more usual\nsince major building works in the priory had been scaled down after the\nmid-fifteenth century.$) Thus the stoneworkers who appeared in the\nrecords were mostly roughmasons responsible for maintenance and\nrepairs.$* Masons were nevertheless frequently paid 5d a day. Carpenters,\nwho were paid by both weekly and daily rates, also belong in this top\ncategory. In most medieval towns they formed the largest occupational\ngroup in the building industry since their work impinged upon most\naspects of construction and repair work.%! Principal craftsmen, such as\nJohn Champnay and Robert Davison, the leading carpenters for the\nbursar and almoner, respectively, between 1495 and 1516, could expect to\nreceive 5d or 6d. Some entries make note of such variations. In 1515, for\ninstance, Thomas Middleton and Thomas Knagg, also leading employees\nof the bursar, were paid for 40 days work at 6d each and 16 days at 5d.%\"\nSince their wages fluctuated between the two figures it is likely that the\nvariation was seasonal, the lower rate being paid during the shorter\nworking days of the winter months.%# The wages of the servants or famuli\nof such men were usually 3d or 4d; the fluctuation was usually in line with\nthat of their masters\u2019 wages, and probably also reflected seasonal trends.\nA second category of crafts generally received lower rates of\n366\nwork and wages at durham priory , 1494\u20131519\nremuneration, of 4d or 4\"\n#\nd a day. A distinction was made here too\nbetween craftsmen and their famuli or servants, the latter generally\nreceiving only 3d. These lower-paid activities included rough masonry,\nwalling, pointing, plastering, daubing, and thatching, which were evidently\nregarded as semi-skilled or lower-skilled occupations. Whilst the average\ndaily rate for thatching and daubing was 4d per day, rates could on\noccasion fall to 3d. Stone-walling, which commanded 5d or 6d a day, was\nbetter paid than walling in wattle-and-daub and the making of internal\n(interclose) walls, which usually realized only 4d per day for the main\nemployees and 3d for their servants. As Table 1 shows, there was little\ndifference between the wages of these lower-paid craftsmen and those of\nservants in higher-paid work.\nIn the building and craft trades it was unusual to find labourers earning\nless than 3d per day. In general maintenance and agricultural labouring,\nhowever, wages rarely rose above this level and could go lower. Mowing\nwas exceptional ; it was paid at the top rate of 6d a day because it was so\nphysically demanding. Other routine farm work did not command more\nthan 3d. The lowest-skilled employees, however, were occasionally paid\nonly 2d. During the \u2018great frost \u2019 of 1495, for instance, 18 men were paid\nonly 2d each for a day\u2019s work helping the priory\u2019s plumber to thaw the\ngreat conduit of the monastery. Labourers hired to fill waggons with dung\nfor removal were paid the same rate. The bursar\u2019s account for 1497 noted\nthat John Scott was paid 2d a day for 13 days\u2019 ploughing at Whinneyclose,\nnear Bearpark. Ploughing rates depended upon a number of different\ncircumstances, however, and 2d a day perhaps implies an assistant\u2019s role.%$\nThough the existence of a durable wage structure is well demonstrated\nin the Durham evidence, there needed to be within it some room for\nnegotiation and in some types of work the division between \u2018skilled\u2019 and\n\u2018semi-skilled\u2019 was sometimes crossed. Towards the later part of the period\nthe average wage rates of those working in stonemasonry dropped to 4d.\nSince the records often do not make clear the precise nature of the tasks\nundertaken, it may be that rough work, repair and refurbishment, rather\nthan full-scale rebuilding, were in progress and that such work was lower-\npaid. Similarly the daily wages of carpenters, though generally a craftsman\ncould often obtain 5d, could at times drop to 4d for rougher work.\nDifferentials in pay of this kind are also found when carpenters were paid\nby the week. Regularly employed craftsmen such as John Champnay and\nRobert Thomson, who were often paid for 51 or 52 weeks of the year,\ncould expect to earn 1s 8d a week, but those lower down the scale often\nreceived only 1s 4d.%%\nIn addition to structures of pay, the priory records also illustrate the\ndifferent structures of working relationships to be met with in everyday\n367\nchristine m . newman\nTable 2\nOrganizational structure of work by job category at Durham Priory,\n1494\u20131519\nOccupational category Indi\u008aidual\nOne craftsman\nand assistant(s) Team Unknown Total\nAdministrative 57 0 175 3 235\nAgricultural 105 0 98 170 373\nBuilding & general\nrepairs 53 41 75 25 194\nCarpentry 30 17 72 0 119\nCarriage 118 1 291 17 427\nDaubing 4 7 21 0 32\nDitching 7 0 20 0 27\nGlazing 28 0 1 1 30\nMaintenance 71 1 35 55 162\nPaving 1 3 1 0 5\nPlastering 2 3 3 0 8\nPlumbing 65 27 1 0 93\nPointing 46 6 10 1 63\nQuarrying 5 3 7 0 15\nSawing 37 1 19 0 57\nSmith work 51 0 5 3 59\nStock-care and shearing 12 0 11 45 68\nTanning 22 0 0 0 22\nThatching 6 33 23 0 62\nTiling 55 5 11 1 72\nTimber-splitting 18 0 5 0 23\nWalling 21 26 59 0 106\nWattle-making, drawing\nstraw and ling 11 0 10 0 21\nWheelwright work 20 0 1 0 21\nMiscellaneous 162 0 13 10 185\nUnspecified 0 3 2 0 5\nTotal 1,007 177 969 331 2,484\n% of total 40\u20135 7\u20131 39\u20130 13\u20133 (100)\n% of jobs whose organizational\nstructure is known\n46\u20138 8\u20132 45\u20130 0 100\nemployment. In Table 2 the 2,484 jobs entries detailed in the accounts\nanalysed are broken down into occupational categories to indicate how\ntasks were organized in terms of employee numbers and skills. A\ndistinction is made between jobs for which men were paid for working\nalone, those where they were employed with subordinate assistants\n(whether servants or famuli), and those allocated to teams. Two different\n368\nwork and wages at durham priory , 1494\u20131519\nforms of teamwork are recognized in the table. In one type, characteristic\nof construction work, two or more craftsmen were employed on equal\nterms, generally with subordinates. In the other type, commonest in\nagricultural work, a contractor was employed to recruit labour for some\nheavy seasonal task.\nTable 2 suggests that solitary work was not uncommon. It accounts for\n46\u20138 per cent of the jobs whose characteristics are recorded. Plumbers,\nsmiths, wheelwrights, glaziers and tilers often worked alone, and so did\nmany employees engaged in minor repairs. In 1495, for instance, Robert\nWilkinson was paid 4s for \u2018rakyng and pynnyng\u2019 (clearing out and\nreplacing mortar in walls) in the choir of East Merrington church for 8\ndays, taking 6d a day, and in 1499 Robert Robynson received 1s 8d for\nsetting the gutter on the door of a kiln, for 4 days at 5d a day.%& Even in\nagriculture (taking \u2018agriculture \u2019 together with \u2018stock care and shearing\u2019\nfrom Table 2), 51\u20138 per cent of all jobs whose form is known were\nallocated to individuals. The employment of a single craftsman and an\nassistant or assistants was, by contrast, uncharacteristic of the sort of\nemployment offered by the priory. This type of contract is represented in\nonly 8\u20132 per cent of cases where the structure is known. It did not occur\nat all in agricultural work.\nTeamwork accounts for 39\u20130 per cent of such jobs in Table 2, which\nmay understate its importance since over half the \u2018Unknown\u2019 category of\njobs was in agriculture, where teamwork was common. Given the number\nof employees in these work teams, this was clearly the normal work\nexperience for an employee of the priory. Building and construction work\ncharacteristically needed more than one pair of hands on a job, and was\ncommonly carried out by two or more craftsmen with subordinate\nassistants.%\u2019 A lot of the need for co-operation resulted from the need to\nshift building materials ; roughmasons, for instance, needed servants and\nlabourers working alongside them in order to carry the stones and\nmortar.%( Over half of all walling jobs (of both stone and wattle-and-daub)\nwere contracted to a team. In 1495, for instance, John Robinson and\nRoland Robinson worked, together with 4 famuli, walling the mill dam\nnext to the monastery for 6 days, taking between them 1s 10d a\nday \u2013 perhaps 5d each for the principals and 3d each for the famuli.%)\nCarpenters, too, more often than not worked together in teams of two or\nmore upon specific tasks. The structure of these groups can often be\nreconstructed from pay differentials. In 1501, for example, three\ncarpenters, Thomas Kirkman, Thomas Ness and John Biddick, were paid\n1s a day between them for 78 days, working upon various repairs\nalongside the bursar\u2019s principal carpenters, John Champnay and Robert\nThomson, who were each contracted to work for 50 weeks of the year at\n369\nchristine m . newman\n1s 8d a week.%* Less-skilled building workers, such as thatchers and\ndaubers, also worked in teams. In 1500, the bursar employed John\nStevynson of Billingham and John Saunderson of Wolviston, together\nwith three famuli, in newly thatching a tenement in Hartlepool. In 1517\nGeorge Rand and John Gubion, together with two servants, daubed walls\nand chimneys in diverse tenements belonging to the commoner in\nClaypath for 8 days, taking between them 1s 4d.&! Certain types of\nagricultural work, general estate maintenance and large-scale carrying\nwork also involved teamwork, sometimes co-ordinated by the priory\ntenants in accordance with known and recurrent practices. The bursar\u2019s\naccount of 1496\u20131497, for example, records that the tenants of Westoe\nand Harton undertook the carriage of 319 waggonloads of stone from the\nquarry of Westoe to Shields.&\" The tenants of Shincliffe regularly\nundertook such large-scale carrying operations for both the priory and\nbishopric administrations. Agricultural tasks like haymaking and mowing\nsometimes mentioned one or two named employees together with various\n\u2018others \u2019, suggesting that the principal workmen recruited further labour\nof their own accord. On other occasions, a regular employee, acting in the\ncapacity of contractor for the priory, recruited casual labourers as and\nwhen necessary. This was not unusual, as research by Penn and Dyer has\nshown.&# As already noted, tithe-collectors in the various priory vills were\nusually regular officials who were paid expenses for the extra seasonal\nwork. Many entries, again, noted unnamed \u2018others \u2019 who assisted in tithe-\ncollecting; these would be professional carters or local villagers, who were\nrecruited, supervised and paid by the named officials.&$ Thomas Falderley,\nthe palliser of Bearpark, was one of these \u2018middlemen\u2019. In some job\ndescriptions, his name was mentioned in isolation and on other occasions\nhe featured with one or two other named individuals. Generally, however,\nhis name appeared together with unspecified \u2018others \u2019 or \u2018associates \u2019,\nwhose recruitment was presumably entrusted to him as the local official.&%\nAnother example is that of Richard Consett, bailiff of Billingham, who\nbetween 1494 and 1501 was paid annually for threshing the tithes of his\nvill, though he undoubtedly recruited others to undertake the work. In\n1503, following Consett\u2019s death, his widow was paid for overseeing the\nsame operation.&& Consett\u2019s successor in the office of bailiff was George\nDavison who also received payment for threshing the tithes and for other\nrepair and maintenance tasks in his locality. Given the scope and diversity\nof these tasks, Davison, like Consett before him, is likely to have\nsubcontracted the work to local tenants.&\u2019\nNot only officials and higher-placed employees were used in this way,\nhowever, for there are references to the more lowly labourers or semi-\nskilled workmen being charged by the priory with similar responsibility.\n370\nwork and wages at durham priory , 1494\u20131519\nA long-serving and regular employee, John Gubion, who worked on a\nvariety of labouring and semi-skilled tasks between 1497 and 1519, also\nacted, on occasion, as a middleman contractor. In several job entries he\nwas named as the principal employee along with unspecified \u2018associates \u2019\nin undertaking chimney repairs, gathering straw and doing road and\nbridge repairs. Presumably, Gubion, as a known and reliable servant of\nthe priory, was sufficiently well regarded to be entrusted with the task of\nhiring others.&( The example of Robert Hepton, who in 1505\u20131506 was\npaid along with diverse unnamed women for drawing straw, is probably\nanother case in point.&)\nThe career of John Gubion serves also to illustrate the piecemeal nature\nof much of the employment offered by the priory to the local populace.\nGubion\u2019s career with the priory spanned almost the entire period of this\nstudy; his first appearance in the accounts was in 1497 and he was still\nthere in 1519. Most of his work was undertaken for the bursar although,\noccasionally, the almoner and commoner also employed him.&*\nAltogether, 79 of his jobs can be identified. They included a variety of\nlabouring tasks such as hedging, ditching, molehill disposal and drawing\nstraw at 3d per day as well as the more skilled jobs of thatching, walling,\ndaubing and general repair and construction work at 4d. In some cases,\nhe even employed his own servants. Indeed Gubion\u2019s precise \u2018occupation\u2019\nis impossible to categorize since he was willing to turn his hand to\nwhatever came his way. Gubion often worked with other regular\nemployees, the majority of whose diverse careers mirrored his own. Most\nof these colleagues remained as lower-paid general labourers. They\nincluded William Crawe, James Crawe and William Greveson, all of\nwhom undertook a variety of agricultural and construction tasks for the\npriory.\u2019!\nGubion and his colleagues were uncharacteristic of the priory\u2019s\nemployees to the extent that they were employed so many times. The\npriory offered regular or frequent employment to very few.\u2019\" Even for\nmany of its most skilled workforce, employment was neither regular nor\nguaranteed, which means that most of those named in the accounts have\nno continuous work record. Out of 562 priory employees identified as\nreceiving wages or expenses, across the departments between 1494 and\n1515, only 138 had any sort of association with the priory in five or more\ndifferent years, and some of these were employed for a particular job only\nonce a year. These 138 men were, by definition, the most stable part of the\npriory workforce, yet even among this group diversity of employment was\ncommon. Table 3 shows that 11 were concerned with administrative tasks\nfor which they were usually paid expenses, whilst another 33 were\ncraftsmen associated with only a single craft. A further 19 were employed\n371\nchristine m . newman\nTable 3\nOccupations of employees of Durham Priory employed in fi\u008ae or more\ndifferent years\nNo. %\nAdministration 11 8\nCraft or trade 33 24\nMiscellaneous tasks 19 14\nCarrying 23 17\nTwo occupations 13 9\nThree or more occupations 39 28\nTotal 138 100\nupon miscellaneous tasks such as lock-mending, torch-making, knife-\nsharpening and repairing the priory\u2019s silverware, all of which were\nrequired only on an irregular basis. Another 23 were carriers, whose\nemployment was similarly infrequent. However, the remainder of these\n138 employees, over a third of the total, were paid for more than one type\nof work, often at differing levels of skill and differing wage rates.\nOf the remaining 424 employees, whose association with the priory\nspanned less than five years, it is difficult to identify any specific career\npatterns within their employment records. Those from the rural vills and\ntownships would, undoubtedly, have led largely agricultural lifestyles.\nEarnings from any employment offered by the priory would thus have\ncontributed only a limited amount towards their overall household\nincomes.\u2019# For many of the priory\u2019s casual employees who were resident\nin Durham itself, mixed household economies were probably also the\norder of the day. Evidence from the bursar\u2019s rent book of 1495\u20131496,\nprovides some evidence of the lifestyles of Durham residents. As pointed\nout above, a number of tenants met some or all of their rent obligations\nin kind. Whilst most city rents were paid in cash, some tenants did make\npayments in kind. Low-grade cloth was the most usual commodity\nrendered, indicating that cloth-making was probably a common by-\nproduct of urban households.\u2019$ One or two tenants made part payments\nin the form of small quantities of livestock, such as calves, piglets and\nchickens, again reinforcing the theory that town and country pursuits\nwere closely linked in late medieval Durham.\u2019% A few others were, as\npreviously discussed, allowed rebates for labour. James Spicer, whose\nname appeared amongst the priory\u2019s employees on two occasions in\n1495\u20131496, paid his rent of 9s, for a tenement in the Durham Bailey, in a\ncombination of cash, cloth and labour allowances. Another short-term\n372\nwork and wages at durham priory , 1494\u20131519\ncasual employee who was granted a rebate for work performed was John\nWoodmouse, who was allowed 1s 7d off his annual rent of 4s, for his\nholding in St Giles Borough.\u2019& Woodmouse undertook five jobs for the\npriory between 1494 and 1497. These were diverse and generally unskilled,\ninvolving tasks such as molehill disposal, hedge-clearing, daubing and\ngeneral labouring on a building site.\u2019\u2019 Thereafter his name disappeared\nfrom the Gilesgate rental and from the priory employment records. He\nmay well, however, have been the same John Woodmouse who later\nappeared in the records of the Durham Borough of Crossgate.\nWoodmouse\u2019s full-time occupation, as detailed in the Crossgate Borough\ncourt records of the early 1500s, was that of a tailor. He also went on to\nsit regularly as a juror in chief sessions of the borough court, suggesting\nthat he may have become a tenant of some status within his community.\u2019(\nIf this were the same man then it is interesting that the five jobs he had\nundertaken, previously, for the priory were unskilled and poorly paid,\nsuggesting that he had been prepared to undertake whatever work was\navailable in times of need, without apparent regard for career or status.\nSuch work, which must only have contributed a small amount towards his\noverall income, was surely regarded as purely supplementary. No evidence\nremains of the lifestyles of most of the priory\u2019s employees but the\nmajority, who appeared in the records only briefly, must, like Woodmouse,\nhave been motivated rather by financial concerns than those of status or\ncareer. This would explain the difficulty encountered in seeking to impose\ncareer structures upon the majority of priory employees since, for the\nmain part, such structures were never in place.\nEven the priory\u2019s highest-paid craftsmen were prepared to move around\nto some extent within the pay structure in order to acquire work, though\nthey seem never to have settled for less than 4d. Those who on occasion\nearned top wages for skilled work would at other times accept a lower rate\nof pay for a task requiring less skill. This is most apparent in masonry\nwork. William Bryan, a regular employee not only of the bursar but also\nof the almoner, hostillar and commoner, appears frequently in the\naccounts in connection with a variety of stone-working tasks.\u2019) In 1494,\nfor instance, he was employed for 16 days upon tasks that included\nmaking new steps and working upon a buttress in the priory\u2019s great barn.\nIn the following year, he undertook repairs to the common oven in\nFramwellgate, within the city of Durham, and in 1497 he was employed\nupon walling the dam of Pittington mill. He often engaged in the making\nand repair of walls. His colleague, William Watson, generally performed\nsimilar tasks.\u2019* As a rule, he occurs in the top category of wage-earners,\ntaking 5d or 6d a day. In 1505, however, Bryan and Watson individually\nundertook walling work (seemingly of wattle-and-daub) for the hostillar\n373\nchristine m . newman\nfor a daily rate of 4d, taking 3d for their famuli.(! In 1513, Bryan and\nWatson together undertook walling and gutter-making for the hostillar,\nagain working at 4d for themselves and 3d each for their three servants.\nThey could also be found undertaking work in company with employees\nsuch as John Gubion and George Skeloss, who were little more than\ngeneral labourers. In 1507, Watson and Skeloss were engaged for 30 days\nupon work which included walling, daubing and \u2018 le pargenyng\u2019 of the\nwalls at Bearpark at 4d per day.(\" The lower rates of pay recorded for\nthese men may simply represent a decline in their abilities in later life, but\nsince other masons were generally taking the same lower rates of pay in\nthe early sixteenth century this is not the most likely interpretation; it\nseems rather that the work available was less skilled.\nAs this latter example suggests, priory employees were also un-\ncommitted to particular structures of work, or to any particular position\nwithin structures. A job entry in the commoner\u2019s account of 1517 records\ndiffering pay rates for five employees working at Hett Mill. Heading the\nlist was the master carpenter, John Champnay, who probably supervised\noperations and took 6d a day. Working alongside him were three\ncraftsmen taking 5d a day and another named individual, taking 4d, who\nwas possibly an apprentice or journeyman. The three craftsmen in this\ncontract, John Barnard, Thomas Hunter and Thomas Knagg, were at\nother times employed as principal employees with subordinates below\nthem.(# Within the lower wage bands, it is possible to identify servants or\ngeneral labourers who nevertheless also contracted for construction work.\nIn 1501, for example, John Gubion, John Atkinson and William Crawe\njointly undertook a thatching job in addition to performing agricultural\ntasks such as hedge-making and foss-clearing. In the same year, Gubion\nand Crawe, working as a team, also undertook some daubing.($\nFrom the evidence it seems that the employment offered by Durham\nPriory was irregular and piecemeal for the majority of its employees. It\nalso drew men into varieties of tasks under differing conditions of pay and\norganization. Rates of pay \u2013 and to some extent working arrangements \u2013\nwere structured in accordance with different types of work, but individual\ncareers were much more unpredictable. In this respect, the priory\u2019s records\nillustrate a feature of the late medieval labour market and work experience\nthat has probably not received as much attention as it deserves. Wages, in\nreal terms, were undoubtedly higher in comparison to later sixteenth-\ncentury standards, and it is in that respect that the later fifteenth century\nand the early sixteenth may be reckoned a Golden Age of labour. Yet this\nwas not a labour market characterized for most people by fixed\nemployment, settled patterns of work or predictable career prospects.\nDurham Priory workers may have had their individual limits as to what\n374\nwork and wages at durham priory , 1494\u20131519\nthey were prepared to do, but much of the time they were taking what they\ncould get.\nacknowledgements\nResearch for this article was undertaken as part of a wider study of employment on the\nDurham Priory Estates in the period 1494\u20131519, funded by the Leverhulme Trust.

Especially towards the end of the\nperiod, however, numbers of 60 or slightly more were most usual ; see Bursar\u2019s accounts,\n1500\u20131501, 1503\u20131502, 1505\u20131506, pensiones et stipendia.\n19 Tempest subsequently became steward of the bishopric of Durham and a leading\nmember of the Council in the North after its re-establishment by Cardinal Wolsey in\n1525; see R.

For the period\nunder consideration, these amounts need to be adjusted downwards, to bring them in\nline with early-sixteenth-century price levels, before the onset of inflation. In terms of\nprices for the decade 1500\u20131509, the equivalent of the Hull and Lincoln subsistence\nrates would be 12s per annum to feed a single man and \u00a32 10s 7d to feed a family with\nfour children. Such figures do not, however, take account of other living costs such as\nrents and fuel. (These calculations are based upon the Phelps Brown and Hopkins index\nof the price of consumables, which suggests that prices increased by 84 per cent between\nthe first decade of the sixteenth century and that of 1540\u20131549; see Phelps Brown and\nHopkins, A perspecti\u008ae of wages, 29.)

By the 1530s, however,\nthe arrangement seems to have been more formal. The payments to Middleton\u2019s\nsuccessor, Thomas Hunter, were itemised in the same section of the accounts as an\nannual stipend.

(This is a printed transcript of Durham Cathedral Dean and\nChapter Muniments, Bursar\u2019s Book K.)\n29 In another entry, however, the provision of materials was accounted for in the job\npayment. In 1509 Hugh Bust, glazier (sometimes also designated \u2018Frenchman\u2019), was\npaid \u00a31 1s for new glazing containing 35\"\n#\nfeet at 4d per foot at Aycliffe, Heighington,\nBillingham, Hesledon and in the chapel of the lord prior and elsewhere, this year.

A shortage of coinage in the region seems\nthe most likely explanation for this, although local preferences for traditional modes of\nexchange may also have played some part.
