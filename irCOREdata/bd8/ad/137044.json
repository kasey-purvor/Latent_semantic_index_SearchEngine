This should help to improve current understanding and future\ninvestigations of DAEC and EAEC epidemiology.\nBackground\nEnteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive, enter-\nohaemorrhagic and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli are\ncategories of enteric E. coli that have been unequivocally\nassociated with diarrhoeal disease through human chal-\nlenge studies and\/or outbreak investigations [1]. Regard-\ning other potentially diarrhoeagenic categories of E. coli,\nthe most evidence for enterovirulence has been compiled\nfor diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC). However, the basis\nfor DAEC pathogenicity is not well understood. The cate-\ngory is heterogeneous and although some studies have\nshown an association of DAEC with diarrhoea, others\nhave not [2]. Two DAEC strains did not elicit diarrhoea\nupon human volunteer challenge and no outbreaks of\nDAEC-associated illness have been documented to date\n[3].\nPublished: 21 December 2009\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:269 doi:10.1186\/1471-2180-9-269\nReceived: 19 June 2009\nAccepted: 21 December 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/269\n\u00a9 2009 Snelling et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:269 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/269Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is another heterogeneous\ndiarrhoeagenic E. coli category. Convincing epidemiolog-\nical information from EAEC outbreaks exists, and at least\none strain was diarrhoeagenic in some human volunteers,\nhowever the category is very diverse (reviewed in refer-\nences [4] and [5]). Compared to other diarrhoeagenic E.\ncoli categories, EAEC and DAEC pathotypes were both\ndescribed relatively recently and their epidemiology, risk\nfactors and pathogenesis are still in early stages of investi-\ngation. Few epidemiological studies seek these categories\nbecause the Gold Standard test for their detection, the\nHEp-2 adherence assay, is cumbersome. This tissue cul-\nture-based test requires expensive facilities and technical\nexpertise that are not universally available.\nAn improved understanding of the importance of diar-\nrhoeagenic E. coli in human disease will depend upon reli-\nable epidemiological data and on channelling of strains\nidentified into molecular pathogenesis research. Accord-\ningly, efforts have been made to develop more widely\napplicable methods to detect EAEC and DAEC. Baudry et\nal. tested fragments from the large plasmid of EAEC strain\n17-2 and identified a 1 Kb fragment, CVD432, which was\n89% sensitive and 99% specific for EAEC strains in their\ncollection [6]. Subsequently, this probe has continued to\nshow specificity for EAEC but its sensitivity has varied\nbetween 15 and 90% in different studies [4]. Bilge et al. [7]\nused a different approach to generate a diagnostic probe\nfor DAEC. They identified, cloned and characterized the\nF1845 adhesin from DAEC strain C1845. The F1845\nadhesin belongs to the Afa\/Dr family and is encoded by a\nfive-gene cluster [2]. Bilge et al. [7] proposed part of the\ndaaC gene of the encoding operon as a marker for DAEC\nstrains. From the time of its discovery, it has been known\nthat the cloned daaC fragment probe (in plasmid\npSLM862) can only identify a subset of DAEC and that\nsome DAEC strains have other adhesins, of which many,\nbut not all, are from the Afa\/Dr family [2]. However, the\ndaaC probe is the one that has been employed most fre-\nquently in epidemiological research to date 8-13. In this\npaper, we report that the daaC cross-hybridizes with a spe-\ncific subset of EAEC strains. We sought to identify the\nmolecular basis for this cross-hybridization and to devise\nan alternate, cost-effective protocol for identifying DAEC.\nMethods\nStrains\nCross reaction of the daaC probe with EAEC was identified\nin the course of screening 509 test E. coli strains, which\nwere isolated from 130 travellers with diarrhoea (up to\nfour isolates were obtained from each specimen), who\nreturned to the UK in 2002-2003, from a total of 33 dif-\nferent countries [14]. We additionally employed 26 well-\ncharacterized archival EAEC strains and seven DAEC\nstrains for control purposes. E. coli K-12 TOP-10 (Invitro-\ngen) was used to maintain plasmids and non-pathogenic\nstrains DH5\u03b1 and MG1655 were used as non-adherent\ncontrols.\nRoutine molecular biology procedures\nStandard molecular biology procedures were employed\n[15]. DNA amplification was performed using 1 unit\nrecombinant Taq polymerase enzyme, 2 mM magnesium\nchloride, PCR buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 1 \u03bcM\noligonucleotide primer in each reaction. All PCR amplifi-\ncations began with a two-minute hot start at 94\u00b0C fol-\nlowed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94\u00b0C for 30s,\nannealing for 30s at 5\u00b0C below primer annealing temper-\nature and extending at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute for every Kb of\nDNA being amplified. PCR reactions were templated with\nboiled bacterial colonies or genomic DNA. High fidelity\nPCR for sequencing used a similar protocol but employed\nPfx polymerase and magnesium sulphate (Invitrogen).\nThe annealing temperature was lowered by 2-3\u00b0C and\nextension time was doubled for Pfx high-fidelity PCR.\nPurified PCR-amplified fragments were incubated with\nTaq polymerase and dNTPs at 72\u00b0C for 20 minutes and\nthen cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) according\nto manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids were trans-\nformed into chemically competent E. coli K-12 TOP10\ncells (Invitrogen).\nColony hybridization\nColony lifts of test and control strains cultured in Brain\nHeart Infusion medium (Oxoid, England) were prepared\nin a 96-well format on nylon membrane (Hybond-N,\nAmersham Biosciences). The membranes were denatured\nin 0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl, neutralized in 1.5 M NaCl,\n0.5 M Tris HCl and 1 mM EDTA, dried and fixed by UV\nexposure. DNA probes consisted of PCR products using\nthe primers in Table 1. The probes were labelled using the\nPCR DIG labelling mix (Roche), according to manufac-\nturer's instructions. Cloned probes were labelled using\nM13F and M13R universal primers. The vector-derived\nends of the probe were then excised with specific restric-\ntion endonucleases and the labelled probe purified. Fol-\nlowing 2 hours pre-hybridization at 42\u00b0C, the\nmembranes were hybridized with denatured probe at\n42\u00b0C, with continuous, gentle agitation in a hybridiza-\ntion solution containing 50% formamide, 5X SSC, 5%\nblocking reagent, 0.1% N-lauryl sarcosine and 0.02%\nSDS. The membranes were washed three times in 2X SSC,\n0.1% SDS and then three times in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS.\nSignal was detected using the DIG nucleic acid detection\nkit (Roche) in accordance with manufacturer's instruc-\ntions.\nHEp-2 adherence assay\nHEp-2 adherence tests were performed as described by\nVial et al. [16]. Bacteria were cultured in LB broth withoutPage 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:269 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/269shaking at 37\u00b0C overnight. HEp-2 cell monolayers were\ncultured overnight in 8-well chamber slides to 50% con-\nfluence in high glucose DMEM with foetal bovine serum,\nstreptomycin and penicillin (Invitrogen) and then\nwashed three times with PBS. 300 \u03bcL of high-glucose\nDMEM media containing 1% mannose (without foetal\nbovine serum and antibiotics) and 10 \u03bcL of bacterial cul-\nture was added to each chamber. After 3h incubation, the\nmedia was aspirated and the monolayer washed three\ntimes with PBS. The cells were fixed for 20 minutes with\n70% methanol and then stained for 20 minutes with a\n1:40 dilution of Giemsa in PBS. Adherence patterns were\nobserved using oil immersion light microscopy at 1000x\nmagnification. All bacterial isolates were tested in dupli-\ncate and replicates were read by two different individuals.\nSequence analyses\nThe EAEC 042 genome sequence was accessed from\nEscherichia coli and Shigella spp. comparative Sequencing\nGroup at the Sanger Institute, and can be accessed at http:\/\n\/www.sanger.ac.uk\/Projects\/Escherichia_Shigella\/. All\nother sequences were retrieved from GenBank. The 042\ndaaC cross-hybridizing region was identified by nucle-\notide BLAST, employing a BLOSUM62 matrix with a low\ncomplexity filter. Pair-wise alignments and computations\nof % identity were done using FASTA and multiple align-\nments were generated using CLUSTAL.\nPCR-RFLP\nWe devised a PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymor-\nphism (PCR-RFLP) test for daaD\/afaD and aafB. Using\nprimers aafBdaaDF and aafBdaaDR, which are comple-\nmentary to regions conserved between the two targets, we\namplified a 333 bp (daaD) or 339 bp (aafB) PCR product.\nRecombinant Taq polymerase enzyme and PCR buffer\nfrom NEB were employed with 1 unit of Taq polymerase,\n2 mM MgCl2 and 1 \u03bcM oligonucleotide primer in each\nreaction. We additionally repeated 48 amplifications\nTable 1: Oligonucleotides used in this study\nPrimer designation oligonucleotides Target\/application Predicted product Reference\/source\nCVD432F 5'-CTG GCG AAA GAC TGT \nATC AT-3'\nAA probe (CVD 432) 629 bp [43]\nCVD432R 5'-CAA TGT ATA GAA ATC \nCGC TGT T-3'\naapF 5'-CTT GGG TAT CAG CCT \nGAA TG-3'\naap, encoding the enteroaggregative E. coli \nplasmid-borne anti-aggregation protein, \ndispersin\n310 bp [44]\naapR 5'-AAC CCA TTC GGT TAG \nAGC AC-3'\naggAF 5'-TTA GTC TTC TAT CTA \nGGG-3'\naggA, encoding the structural subunit of \naggregative adherence fimbriae I\n450 bp [17]\naggAR 5'-AAA TTA ATT CCG GCA \nTGG-3'\naggRF 5'-CTA ATT GTA CAA TCG \nATG TA-3'\naggR, encoding the enteroaggregative E. \ncoli plasmid-borne aggregative adherence \nregulator\n457 bp [44]\naggRR 5'-AGA GTC CAT CTC TTT \nGAT AAG-3'\nM13F 5'-GGT TTT CCC AGT CAC \nGAC-3'\nVector priming sequencing primer Not applicable\nM13R 5'-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG \nACC-3'\nVector priming sequencing primer Not applicable\naafBdaaDF 5'-CCTGCGGGATGTTACT-3' aafB from EAEC and daaD from DAEC 333\/339 This study\naafBdaaDR 5'-GCCATCACATCAAAAA-3'Page 3 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:269 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/269using PCR-Supermix (Invitrogen) and obtained identical\nresults. All amplifications began with a two-minute hot\nstart at 94\u00b0C followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 94\u00b0C\nfor 30s, annealing at 41\u00b0C for 30s at and extending at\n72\u00b0C for 20s. PCR reactions were templated with boiled\nbacterial colonies or genomic DNA. Strains containing the\ndaaD or aafB gene gave a predicted 333 or 339 bp product\nrespectively. This product was digested with the restriction\nenzyme AluI. The digestion generates two predicted frag-\nments for aafB and five fragments for the more GC rich\ndaaD gene, which can be resolved on a 2% TBE agarose\ngel.\nResults\nThe daaC probe cross-hybridizes with a sub-set of EAEC\nIn the course of an aetiologic study of diarrhoea focused\non diarrhoeagenic E. coli, we observed that in addition to\nrecognizing diffusely adherent E. coli strains, the daaC\nprobe was hybridizing to colony blots of some test and\ncontrol strains that showed aggregative adherence. We\nhybridized the daaC probe with colony blots of a well-\nstudied panel of 26 EAEC strains and seven DAEC strains.\nWe found that five of these EAEC strains hybridized with\nthe daaC probe, including prototypical EAEC strain 042,\neven when conditions were of slightly greater stringency\nthan those reported in the literature [11]. All five had pre-\nviously been documented to carry the aafA gene, encoding\nthe structural subunit of the AAF\/II fimbriae [17]. As\nshown in Figure 1, hybridization was noticeably weaker\nthan to the DAEC strains, but sufficiently strong to con-\nfound strain categorization. Twenty-one strains lacking\naafA did not hybridize with the daaC probe, irrespective of\nwhether they hybridized to the probe for aggA, the struc-\ntural subunit gene for AAF\/I fimbriae (Table 2).\nFrom a second, and larger, collection of 509 test E. coli\nstrains from 130 recent travellers with diarrhoea, 48\nshowed aggregative adherence (AA), 52 diffuse adherence\n(DA), and 181 were non-adherent [14] (Table 3). Another\n228 showed some degree of adherence, ranging from very\nweak diffuse to strong but indeterminate patterns of\nadherence. These included 49 strains with a pattern that\nhad elements of both aggregative and diffuse adherence,\ntermed AA\/DA. The daaC probe hybridized with only 2\n(1.1%) of the non-adherent strains and with 60 (18.3%)\nadherent bacterial isolates. Of these, 28 were diffusely-\nadherent, nine displayed aggregative adherence, 22\nshowed AA\/DA and the remaining strain had cell-detach-\ning properties. Although the sensitivity of the daaC probe\nfor DAEC or DAEC plus AA\/DA strains combined was low\n(53.8 and 49.5% respectively), as has been previously\nacknowledged, the specificity and positive predictive\nvalue for DAEC were considerably higher (at 93.2 and\n45.2% respectively). These rates are comparable or better\nthan values for other probes for aggregative or diffusely\nadherent E. coli. However the false positives identified by\nthe daaC probe were not randomly distributed across E.\ncoli categories. The daaC probe recognized 18.8% (9 out of\n48) of aggregative adherent strains but only 1.1% of non-\nadherent strains (Table 3, p < 0.0001; Fishers exact test).\nTo verify that the hybridizing aggregative adherent strains\nwere true and typical EAEC, that is strains carrying a par-\ntially conserved plasmid referred to as pAA, we screened\nthem for EAEC virulence loci. Only one of the nine aggre-\ngative adherent daaC-positive strains hybridized with the\nCVD432 probe [6], but seven of the nine strains hybrid-\nized with at least one other EAEC probe (the pAA-borne\naggC for aggregative adherence fimbrial usher [18] or aap\nfor dispersin [19] or the chromosomal gene pic for muci-\nnase, which is also present in Shigella [20]). Only one\ndaaC-positive strain showing aggregative adherence did\nnot hybridize with one of the four EAEC probes we\nemployed. Importantly, all but one of nine aafA-positive\nEAEC strains identified among the 509 E. coli isolates\nhybridized with the daaC probe. Four of the nine daaC-\npositive EAEC strains were from the same individual and\nprobably clonal. The other five were from five separate\npatients, who were recent returnees from four different\ncountries. Overall, evidence from two independently\nderived strain sets suggests that the daaC probe recognizes\na specific subset of EAEC, that is strains that possess aafA.\nThe daaC cross-hybridizing locus in EAEC is aafC\nThe daaC probe is excised from plasmid pSLM862 with\nPstI prior to use (7). We used vector-priming M13 oligo-\nnucleotides to sequence the pSLM862 insert, which we\nhave deposited in the Genbank database (Accession\nNumber EU010379). A BLAST search of the Genbank\nnucleotide database revealed that the daaC probe was\n97% identical to draC\/afaC\/dafaC genes from other, dif-\nfuse-adherence associated operons in the Genebank data-\nbase (Accession numbers AF325672.1, X76688.1 and\nAF329316.1).\nA BLAST search of the recently completed genome of\ncross-hybridizing EAEC strain 042 at http:\/\/\nwww.sanger.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/blast\/submitblast\/\nescherichia_shigella, revealed that the most similar target\nfor the daaC probe that can be identified in the 042\ngenome in silico is the aafC gene, part of the AAF\/II-encod-\ning operon, with 294 (84%) identical nucleotides and\nonly five single nucleotide gaps over the length of the\nhomologous 344 nucleotide daaC probe region, at the\nDNA level (Figure 2). The aafC gene is located on the large\nvirulence plasmid of strain 042 and other AAF\/II-positive\nEAEC [21]. The daaC gene, on the other hand, may be\nchromosomally or plasmid located [7]. Therefore,\nalthough genuine target strains often have only one copy\nof daaC, cross hybridizing strains could potentially havePage 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2009, 9:269 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/9\/269one or more copies of the aafC gene, a factor that could\nalso contribute to the hybridization signals of aafC-posi-\ntive EAEC. Elias et al. have previously noticed that entero-\naggregative E. coli strains hybridize to the daaC probe and\nproposed that the cross-hybridizing region was within the\nAAF\/II fimbrial biogenesis cluster [21]. In this study, all\nbut one strain possessing the aafA gene from the AAF\/II\nbiogenesis cluster hybridized with the daaC probe. We\nhybridized the panel of 26 well-studied strains to a DNA\nfragment probe for the aggregative adherence fimbrial\nusher gene, aggC, which has been demonstrated by\nBernier et al. to hybridize to both aggC and aafC [18]. All\nthe aafA-positive, daaC-positive strains hybridized with\nthis probe (Table 2). In summary, we report that daaC\ncross-hybridization arises from an 84% identity between\nthe probe sequence and the EAEC aafC gene, and that this\ndegree of similarity significantly compromises diagnostic\nuse of the existing daaC probe for the detection of DAEC.\nTable 2: Hybridization of well-studied EAEC and DAEC strains to EAEC probes and daaC and results of PCR-RFLP test for daaD and \naafB.\nStrain Serotype Country of \nisolation\/\nsource\nHEp-2 \nadherence \npattern*\npAA \n(CVD 432)\naap aggA aafA daaC\nhybrid-ization \n(SLM 862)\naafB\/daaD \nRFLP\nAA 60A Mexico Aggregative + + + - - -\nAA H232-1 Peru Aggregative-\ndetaching\n+ + - - - -\nAA 17-2 O3:H2 Chile Aggregative-\ndetaching\n+ + + - - -\nAA 253-1 O3:H2 Thailand Aggregative + + + - - -\nAA 6-1 OR:H2 Thailand Aggregative + + - - - -\nBM369 O86 India Aggregative - - - - - -\nAADS65-R2 Philippines Weak localised-\naggregative\n- - - - - -\nAA 501-1 OR:H53 Thailand Aggregative - - - - - -\nAA H223-1 Peru Aggregative + + - - - -\nAA DS67-R2 Philippines Aggregative + + + - - -\nAA 042 O44:H18 Peru Aggregative + + - + + aafB\nAA 144-1 O77:NM Thailand Aggregative-\ndetaching\n+ + - - + aafB\nAA 44-1 O36:H18 Thailand Aggregative + + - - - -\nAA H145-1 Peru Aggregative + + + - - -\nAA 309-1 O130:H27 Thailand Aggregative + + + - + aafB\nH133 Peru Aggregative + - - - - -\nMH46-2 Peru Aggregative + + - - - -\nM32-1 Peru Aggregative - + - - - -\nC04 Nigeria Aggregative + + - - - -\nC08 Nigeria Aggregative + + - - - -\nAA 103-1 O148:H28 Thailand Aggregative + + - - - -\nAA 435-1 O33:H16 Thailand Aggregative + + - + + aafB\nAA 199-1 OR:H1 Thailand Aggregative + + - + + aafB\nAA H194-2 Peru Aggregative + + + - - -\nAA 278-1 O125ac:H21 Thailand Aggregative + + - - - -\nAA 239-1 OR:H21 Thailand Aggregative + - - - - -\nAA 101-1 O?:H10 Japan Aggregative - - - + + aafB\nG02a Nigeria Aggregative-\ndetaching\n- - + - - -\nD163 UK Aggregative - + - - - -\nAA H92-1 Peru Aggregative - - - - - -\nDH5\u03b1 CVD\u2020 Non-adherent - - - - - -\nMG1655 CVD\u2020 Non-adherent - - - - - -\nDAEC1 CVD\u2020 Diffuse - - - - + daaD2\nDA57-1186 CVD\u2020 Diffuse - - - - + daaD\nDA55-2186 CVD\u2020 Diffuse - - - - + daaD\nDAEC4 CVD\u2020 Diffuse - - - - + daaD\nTW6350 O157:H45 T.

Down-\nstream of the usher genes is a smaller open reading frame.\nIn the case of the EAEC aafC, the downstream gene, aafB,\nhas not been experimentally defined and may encode a\nprotein that represents the AAF\/II tip adhesin [22]. The\naafB predicted product shares 59% identity with the\nDAEC AfaD\/DaaD, a non-structural adhesin encoded by a\ngene downstream of afaC\/daaC [21]. At the DNA level,\naafB and daaD\/afaD genes also share some identity (63%\nover the most similar 444 bp region), but this is less than\nthat of the usher genes (Figure 3).\nAs shown in Figure 2, three regions of similarity between\nafaD and aafB, at the DNA level, are interspersed by two\ndissimilar regions. We devised a PCR-Restriction Frag-\nment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) test for daaD\/\nafaD and aafB using primers complementary to regions\nconserved between the two targets, and digesting the 333\/\n339 bp product with the restriction enzyme AluI. The\ndigestion generates two fragments for aafB (233 and 106\nbp) and five fragments for the more GC rich daaD gene\n(123, 106, 50, 36 and 18 bp). As shown in Figure 4, whilst\nthe smallest daaD fragments are not visible, the two pro-\nfiles are easily distinguished on a 2% agarose gel.\nIn the course of our investigations, we identified a third\nrestriction profile, initially from strain DAEC1 (Figure 4).\nWe sequenced the amplified region from this strain and\ndetermined that although the probe showed a 100% iden-\ntity with daaD over most of its sequence, there was a 60 bp\nregion with no significant homology. We refer to this\nallele as daaD2, and have deposited the sequence in Gen-\nBank (Accession Number EU010380). daaD2 lacks the\ntwo AluI sites closest to the 5' end of daaD (Figure 2),\nwhich lie within the non-conserved region, but otherwise\nis very similar to daaD. Digestion of the PCR product from\nthis allele yields 3 fragments of 104, 109 and 120 bp,\nwhich are irresolvable on a 2% gel but produce a profile\neasily distinguished from that of aafB and daaD (Figure\n4). We found that daaD was more common than daaD2 in\nour collection. Additionally, there are four sequences\nfrom strains bearing identical or nearly identical (>99%\nidentity) daaD2 alleles already deposited in GenBank\n[23], but as many as 20 sequences from an equivalent\nnumber of strains with classic daaD alleles. This does sug-\ngest that daaD may be the more common allele, but the\nepidemiological significance of the variation, if any, in\nthese alleles is unclear.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThere have been brief mentions of daaC hybridization\nwith EAEC in the literature. In some studies, the hybridi-\nzation of the daaC probe to enteroaggregative E. coli has\nbeen taken to mean that the strains in question harbour a\ndaa adhesin target as well as aggregative adherence genes\n[24]. Other workers have proposed that the hybridization\nsignal arises from cross-hybridization at a single locus\n[21,25]. Although the former situation is a possibility,\nparticularly as aggregative fimbrial genes are plasmid-\nColony blot of representative reference strains hybridized to the daaC probe from pSLM862Figure 1\nColony blot of representative reference strains \nhybridized to the daaC probe from pSLM862.

This finding has implications for our current\nunderstanding of the epidemiology of diarrhoeagenic E.\ncoli.\nUnderstanding the aetiology of diarrhoea is important,\nparticularly in high disease burden areas where risk factors\nneed to be identified and vaccine development priorities\nestablished. Most of what is known about the relative\nimportance of different diarrhoeagenic E. coli categories\ncomes from small, snapshot studies or studies of travel-\nler's diarrhoea, analogous to what Guerrant et al. [26] refer\nto as the 'eyes of the hippopotamus'. Many high-burden\ndeveloping countries lack cell culture facilities for the\nGold Standard HEp-2 assay needed to delineate some\npathotypes of diarrhoea-causing E. coli from commensals.\nNon-radioactive DNA probes and, more recently, PCR\nhave been advocated as methodology that might be used\nto detect enterovirulent E. coli in developing countries\n[27,28]. The vast majority of earlier studies that have not\nused HEp-2 adherence assays have defined DAEC as E. coli\nthat hybridize to the daaC probe.\nOf 30 Medline-indexed controlled studies that sought\nDAEC, we were able to identify only nine that have here-\ntofore demonstrated an association of DAEC with diar-\nrhoea. Gir\u00f3n et al. [29] used daaC probe hybridization\nand HEp-2 adherence and found that DAEC were associ-\nated with disease in Mayan children in Mexico. However\nthat study had a very short duration (3 weeks) and\nfocused on a small remote population (63 cases, 1300\ntotal population), and therefore there are limits to the\nextent to which the data should be extrapolated. Cegielski\net al. [30] found probe-positive, but not diffuse-adherent\nDAEC associated with chronic diarrhoea in HIV-positive\nand HIV-negative patients in another small study in Tan-\nzania. A recent Brazilian study made a similar finding:\nprobe-positive DAEC were associated with paediatric diar-\nrhoeal disease, particularly in older children [13]. A Bang-\nladeshi study reported that DAEC identified by adherence\nassay were associated with persistent but not acute diar-\nrhoea (p < 0.05)[31]. A number of other developing coun-\ntry studies published since that time, employing probe\nand adherence, adherence alone, or PCR-based detection\nhave failed to find an association between detection of\nDAEC and disease [8,10,12], 32-35.\nIn 1993, Levine et al. observed that a Chilean study,\nentirely reliant on the daaC probe, represented the\n\"strongest epidemiologic evidence so far to indicate that\nDAEC may indeed be pathogenic\"[36]. This large, con-\ntrolled cohort study identified DAEC, based on daaC\nhybridization alone, in 16.6% of cases and 11.9% of con-\ntrols (p = 0.0024). In that study, children aged 4-5 years\nhad a relative risk of 2.1 for DAEC (overall relative risk\nwas 1.4). Subsequent reports from studies using only the\nprobe support the findings of that study [13,37,38]. For\nexample, a 2005 US study found that DAEC identified by\nSLM862 probe were associated with diarrhoea (p < 0.05)\nbut DAEC identified by HEp-2 adherence were not [38].\nOverall, in the light of the limitations of the daaC probe\nwe here report, only three published studies that we\nreviewed unequivocally suggest a role for DAEC in acute\ndiarrhoeal disease. Jallat et al. [11] used HEp-2 adherence\nto identify DAEC in a French study and found these organ-\nisms to be significantly associated with disease in patients\nof all ages (p < 0.0001). In that study, only 33 of the 100\nDAEC isolates identified hybridized with the daaC probe\nand interestingly, five of these strains also hybridized with\nthe CVD432 probe for enteroaggregative E. coli and\nshowed an aggregative-diffuse pattern of adherence. Ten\ndaaC positive strains were non-adherent. A second study,\nby Gunzburg et al. [39], found that DAEC were not asso-\nciated with diarrhoea overall, and were more common in\nBLAST alignment of a diffuse adherence dafa\/daa operon (Accession number AF325672) and region 2 of the aaf\/II operon from strain 042 (Accession number AF114828)Figure 2\nBLAST alignment of a diffuse adherence dafa\/daa \noperon (Accession number AF325672) and region 2 \nof the aaf\/II operon from strain 042 (Accession \nnumber AF114828).

However, Gunz-\nburg et al. did find that in children aged 18 months to five\nyears, DAEC were recovered from 11 cases and 4 controls\n(p \u2264 0.05). Similarly, Scaletsky et al. [9] found that DAEC\nwas not associated with disease overall in a study per-\nformed in North-East Brazil but was significantly associ-\nated with diarrhoea among children in the 13-24 month\nold age group. These studies provide evidence to advocate\nthat future investigations aim to determine whether there\nis a role for DAEC in diarrhoea in some populations, par-\nticularly in children over one year of age, and that they do\nso using techniques other than the daaC probe.\nThere are important implications for the role of pathogens\nother than DAEC in disease that may come to light if the\ndaaC probe is replaced with more specific testing meth-\nods. Recent studies have demonstrated that AAF\/II-posi-\ntive EAEC are more significantly associated with diarrhoea\nthan the EAEC category as a whole 40-43. Thus any test for\nDAEC that detects potentially AAF\/II EAEC will skew the\nresults towards a stronger association of the DAEC cate-\ngory with disease, particularly if the EAEC strains in ques-\ntion are negative for the commonly used but inadequately\nsensitive EAEC CVD432 probe. Additionally, evidence\nsupporting a role in diarrhoea for less-studied E. coli cate-\ngories such as cell-detaching E. coli or cytolethal distend-\ning toxin-producing E. coli, appears to be equivalent to\nsupporting data for DAEC, if daaC-derived data is dis-\ncounted. Future investigators may want to consider these\nunder-studied categories as worthy of further study.\nThere is some suggestion that DAEC could be an impor-\ntant pathogen in weaned children but in order to correctly\ngauge the relative contributions of DAEC and other path-\nPair-wise alignment between the daaD and aafB gene regions used as a basis for a discriminatory PCR-RFLPFigure 3\nPair-wise alignment between the daaD and aafB gene regions used as a basis for a discriminatory PCR-RFLP. \nIdentities are asterixed.

Given\nthat AAF\/II-positive EAEC represent an important subset\nof that category and therefore there is considerable advan-\ntage of testing for both simultaneously, particularly as cur-\nrent PCR-based protocols typically do not screen for\nDAEC and use CVD432 as the EAEC target [28].
