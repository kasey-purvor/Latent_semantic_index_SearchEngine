Pay increases\nare higher following acquisitions of targets with high pay, but not high pay countries.

The empirical literature on\nexecutive pay documents a strong link between firm size and executive pay, and a much weaker\nlink between pay and performance (Murphy, 1999). Consequently, making a firm larger by\nacquisition could increase the compensation of an existing manager, regardless of whether the\nacquisition creates value or not.1 The empirical literature on takeovers suggests that a majority\nof takeovers neither improve profitability nor benefit acquirer shareholders (see, e.g., Hughes,\n1989). This has been the motivation for the majority of studies that make up the large empirical\nliterature on the effects of M&A activity on executive compensation.\nThis literature, shows that acquiring firms are on average rewarded with higher absolute\ncompensation following acquisition (Khorana and Zenner, 1998; Bliss and Rosen, 2001;\nAnderson et al., 2004; Grinstein and Hribar, 2004; Girma et al., 2006; and Harford and Li,\n2007). Evidence on whether these pay increases are greater than would be expected from\ninternal growth is mixed. Firth (1991), Conyon and Gregg (1994), Khorana and Zenner (1998),\nand Girma et al. (2006) find evidence in favour, whilst Avery et al. (1998), Bliss and Rosen\n(2001), Anderson et al., (2004), and Harford and Li (2007) find evidence against. Evidence on\nwhether bad acquisitions also result in pay increases is also mixed. Lambert and Larcker (1987),\nKhorana and Zenner (1998), and Girma et al. (2006) find no evidence of this, whilst Firth\n(1991), Avery et al. (1998), Bliss and Rosen (2001) and Anderson et al., (2004) find evidence in\nfavour. The evidence on how poor acquisitions affect overall director wealth (pay plus\nshareholding value) is mixed. Firth (1991) and Bliss and Rosen (2001) find that poor\nacquisitions result in an increase in total CEO wealth, whilst Lambert and Larcker (1987) find\nthat the effect on CEO wealth is negative. If pay awards following acquisition are a\nmanifestation of agency problems, then pay awards should be constrained by sound corporate\ngovernance. The evidence is, once again, mixed. Grinstein and Hribar (2004) show that CEOs\n3receive significantly larger cash bonuses when the CEO is also the chairman and when the CEO\nalso sits on the nominating committee, whilst Anderson et al. (2004), find no evidence that pay\nincreases are related to either CEO share ownership or tenure.2\nThe extant literature exhibits a variety of sampling procedures and methodologies and is\nclearly ambiguous in its findings. One significant drawback with this literature is that it focuses\non only one subset of acquisitions, those of domestic companies that are publicly listed. No\nstudy has included, or examined the difference between, acquisitions of cross-border as well as\ndomestic targets, or acquisitions of private as well as public targets. These types of acquisitions\nare quantitatively very important, accounting for a significant and increasing proportion of\ntakeover activity (Conn et al., 2005). There are also a number of reasons why pay impacts will\ndiffer across these different types of acquisitions.3\nCross-border acquisitions may result in a more complex organisation due to factors such as\ngeographic dispersion, multiple currencies, and cultural differences (see e.g., Duru and Reeb,\n2002). According to the matching theory (Rosen, 1992), multinational firms may bid up the\ncompensation of highly skilled executives because their managerial product is higher at such\nfirms. Alternatively, an increase in managerial compensation might follow the confirmation of\nthe multinational talent of the manager and putting it to the test at the newly merged entity.\nConsistent with these arguments, previous studies show that executive pay is positively related\nto international scope (Persons, 2001; Duru and Reeb, 2002; Ramcharran, 2002; and Thompson\net al., 2002).\nAnother reason that both cross-border and public acquisitions will have a more positive\nimpact on executive pay relates to the level of pay in the target company. Where the acquirer's\nlevel of pay is lower than that of the acquiree, there may be a tendency for the acquirer's pay\nlevels to gravitate towards the acquiree's levels following acquisition. Maintaining separate\nwage scales for executives could be difficult and interfere with integration of the operations of\nthe combined firms, and post-merger equality in compensation systems may be easier to achieve\nthrough pay rises than through pay cuts. As shown in Figure 1 below, important international\n4differences in compensation exist. In particular, CEO pay is significantly higher in the US than\nelsewhere (see e.g., Murphy, 1999; and Conyon and Murphy, 2000). This is of particular\nimportance in the context of our sample, since US targets account for almost half of all cross-\nborder acquisitions by UK acquirers. Murphy (1999) argues that, \u201cforeign companies acquiring\nUS subsidiaries face huge internal pay inequities, often resolved by increasing home-country\nexecutive pay\u201d (p.8).4, 5, 6 The same argument holds for acquisitions of public targets because\npublic firms tend to pay higher executive compensation than private firms (Ke et al., 1999).7\nFIGURE 1 HERE\nIn this paper, we empirically examine the impact of a comprehensive sample of 4,528\nacquisitions on the executive pay of 2,469 publicly listed UK firms over the period 1984-2001.\nIt is the analysis of this comprehensive sample, which includes foreign, domestic, public and\nprivate acquisition targets, that marks our key contribution to the literature. One concern with\nthe extant literature is the generality of the findings, given that only a minority of acquisitions\nare examined. Firstly, therefore, we provide findings on pay impacts which are robust to the\ninclusion of all acquisition types. We find that acquisitions result in significant pay increases in\nthe year following acquisition, but that the increase is transitory and offset by a similar decline\ntwo years after acquisition, possibly because the initial increase represents a one off bonus\npayment. Secondly, we distinguish pay impacts according to target nationality and\norganizational form and test the specific hypotheses described above. Such an analysis improves\nour understanding of the factors that determine pay changes around acquisition. We find no\nevidence that pay changes are affected by target nationality or organizational form. However,\ninitial cross-border acquisitions, which presumably have a marginally greater impact on\ninternational exposure than subsequent acquisitions, do result in significantly higher pay. Since\nthe previous studies above do not consider the impact of different forms of geographic\nexpansion on executive pay, this result enhances our understanding of the mechanism through\nwhich such impacts occur. We find that although pay changes are significantly higher when the\ntarget company has relatively high pay, acquisitions in high pay countries do not result in higher\n5pay. Our third contribution is to examine a key theme in the literature, namely the motivation of\nacquirers to make poor acquisitions because of executive pay considerations. In contrast to\nprevious studies, we do so for a comprehensive sample, examining whether the propensity to\nacquire depends on prior acquisition pay awards, and whether bad acquisitions result in pay\nincreases and an overall increase in CEO wealth. We find that propensity to acquire is higher\nfollowing high pay awards, and that even bad acquisitions result in pay increases, although such\nincreases are far outweighed by declines in CEO share values. Finally, we contribute to the\nliterature by examining whether weak corporate governance results in higher pay awards and\nhence whether such awards are a manifestation of agency problems. We find no evidence of this.\nThe paper proceeds as follows: Section I describes the econometric methodology and the\ndata. In Section II we present the empirical results. Section III concludes.\nI. METHODOLOGY AND DATA\nTo test for the existence of a relationship between top executive compensation and acquisitions\nwe build on a basic relationship between executive pay and the various determinants which have\nbeen identified as important in the literature on executive pay (see e.g., Girma et al., 2006). This\nbasic relationship may be written as follows:\nln Pay it = \u03b2 0 + \u03b21 ln Pay it-1 + \u03b22 ln Sales it + \u03b23 ROA it\n(1) + \u03b24 MTBV it + \u03b25 Acquisition it + f i + h t + e it\nwhere Pay it is defined as the total cash compensation (salary plus bonus) of the highest paid\ndirector in company i at time t. Pay it-1 is the lagged value of variable Pay it. The impact\ncoefficient \u03b21 gives an estimate of the degree of top pay persistence. Previous studies have\nshown that there is significant persistence in top pay (Conyon, 1997; Girma et al., 2006) and\ntherefore it needs to be controlled for. Sales it represents firm sales and is our measure of\ncompany size, which is necessary to control for since most compensation studies have found a\npositive relation between compensation and firm size. ROA it is the accounting return on assets,\ncomputed as the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to total assets. Agency theories\n6predict that firm performance will be positively correlated with compensation. MTBV it is the\nmarket to book value. Acquisition it is a set of dummy variables for the years surrounding\nacquisition. It may take time for the effects of acquisition on pay to be observable (Girma et al.,\n2006) and therefore separate acquisition variables were defined for the year following\nacquisition and then for each of the following two years to capture lagged effects. Additionally,\nto examine whether any pay effects are the result of the acquisition and not the continuation of a\npre-merger trend, acquisition variables were also defined for the two years preceding acquisition\nto capture lead effects. f i are firm specific fixed effects which are included to purge from the\nestimated equation any unobserved time invariant company factors that may contaminate the\nestimation of the pay regression. h t are year dummies employed to account for economy-wide\nshocks, and e it is an error term.\nWith regard to our measure of executive pay, we follow other UK executive pay work (see,\ne.g., Girma et al., 2006) in defining CEO compensation as the reported emoluments (salary plus\nbonus plus the cash equivalents of any perquisites but excluding pension contributions) of the\nhighest paid director. Until 1997, this was the only widely available measure of CEO pay.\nAlthough it has been possible since 1997 to identify the specific components of compensation\n(such as stock options) received by each board member, given the econometric model employed\nhere (which requires 2 years of lagged compensation) any analysis involving this more recent\ndata would be restricted to years 1999-2001 only. Hence for almost all our sample period, the\nreported pay plus bonus of the highest paid director is the only measure of compensation\navailable and subsequently the only measure employed. We expect any bias introduced by not\nexamining long term incentives to be minimal. For most of the sample period, maximum option\ngrants were tied to base salary and hence were not an independent element of salary and the\nevidence suggests that long term incentives form only a small part of executive compensation\n(Conyon and Murphy, 2000).\nThe presence of a lagged dependent variable in panel data models renders the conventional\nfixed effects estimator biased (Nickell, 1981). To avoid this problem, we adopt the first\n7difference transformation of equation (1) to eliminate the company specific fixed effects as\noriginally suggested by Anderson and Hsaio (1982) as follows:\n\u2206 ln Pay it = \u03b20 + \u03b21 \u2206 ln Pay it-1 + \u03b22 \u2206 ln Sales it + \u03b23 \u2206 ROA it\n(2) + \u03b24 \u2206 MTBV it + \u03b25 Acquisition it + f i + h t + e it\nwhere the operator \u2206 on any variable X is simply current value X minus last period value (that\nis, \u2206 X = X t \u2013 X t-1).\nTaking first differences as in equation (2) induces an MA(1) error term, and therefore\nestimation of this dynamic panel data model by least squares results in biased estimates on the\nlagged dependent variable, \u03b21 (Nickell, 1981). We employ instrumental variable techniques to\navoid such problems. The MA(1) error structure suggests that under the null of no serial\ncorrelation, valid instruments are those dated t-2 and earlier. We instrument \u2206 ln Pay it-1 with\nlags of pay in levels (ln Pay it-2), sales (ln Sales it-2), profitability (ROA it-2), MTBV (MTBV it-2),\nand year dummies.8 This approach has been used by previous empirical pay studies in the UK\n(Main et al., 1996; Conyon, 1997; and Girma et al., 2006). We estimate the model using the\nArrellano and Bond (1991) generalised method of moments (GMM) procedure as contained in\nthe econometric programme Stata. This yields valid instrumental variable estimates in the\nabsence of second-order serial correlation. The validity of the instrument set and the success of\nthe instrumentation process in purging the estimates of second order serial correlation are\nexamined using the Sargan test of instrument validity and a test for second order serial\ncorrelation, respectively.\nThe data used in this analysis is derived from two separate sources. The first source is\nDatastream, from which director compensation, sales, profitability and MTBV are derived.\nThree successive years of data are required because the regression model described in equation\n(2) requires two years of lagged data. It was therefore necessary to exclude from the Datastream\npopulation of UK public firms those firms lacking three continuous years of director\ncompensation, sales, profitability, and MTBV over the period 1982-2001. Our pay model is\nestimated from 1984 to 2001, but for 1984 observations we require data going back to 1982. Our\n8final sample consists of an unbalanced panel (i.e., differing time series observations per\ncompany) of 2,471 companies between 1984 and 2001 for which we have 19,565 firm year\nobservations. The balance of the panel is shown in Table 1 below.\nTABLE 1 HERE\nTwo secondary datasources, Thomson Financial SDC Mergers Database and the Thomson\nFinancial magazine Acquisitions Monthly, were then used to attempt to identify every\nacquisition made by the sample firms over the period January 1st 1984 to December 31st 2001.\nAcquisitions are defined as occurring when the bidder owns less than 50% of the target\u2019s voting\nshares before the takeover, and increases its ownership to at least 50% as a result of the\ntakeover. We adopt a materiality constraint that limits our sample to acquisitions in which the\ntarget\u2019s acquisition value is at least 5% of the acquiring firm\u2019s market value in the acquisition\nmonth.9\nOur final sample consists of 4,528 acquisitions, carried out by 1,408 acquirers. The balance\nof the panel for acquirers and non-acquirers is shown in Columns (3) and (4) of Table 1. The\nannual breakdown of the sample acquisitions is reported in Table 2, and is broken down\naccording to whether the target company is a UK or foreign firm, or a public or private firm. Of\nthe 4,528 acquisitions, 29 percent are acquisitions of cross-border targets. 49 percent of these are\nacquisitions of US targets, highlighting the importance of US targets in the cross-border\nacquisition activity of UK acquirers. Of the other 660 cross-border acquisitions, the vast\nmajority (76%) involve European targets. Only 17 percent of the sample acquisitions involve\npublic targets. Acquisitions of domestic public targets, the type of acquisition that previous\nstudies have focused on, account for only 13 percent of the sample.\nTABLE 2 HERE\nTable 3 below reports the absolute size of the different types of acquisitions. Total deal value\nis the total value of all transactions. Deal size is the value of the transaction. Acquirer size is the\nacquirer\u2019s market value at the start of the announcement month. Relative size is deal size\ndivided by acquirer size.10 Domestic targets tend to be smaller in absolute terms but larger in\n9relative terms than cross-border targets, whilst public targets tend to be larger in both absolute\nand relative terms than private targets.\nTABLE 3 HERE\nTable 4 below presents the summary statistics for the continuous variables (compensation,\nsales, profitability and MTBV) used in the regression analysis.\nTABLE 4 HERE\nII. EMPIRICAL RESULTS\nColumn (1) of Table 5 below reports the results of estimating equation (2). The coefficient for \u2206 \nln Pay it-1 is significantly positive, indicating that changes in pay are positively related to prior\ncompensation levels. The coefficient for \u2206 ln Sales it is significantly positive. The coefficient for\n\u2206 ROA it is insignificantly positive, whilst the coefficient for \u2206 MTBV it is insignificantly\nnegative. These results are robust and hold throughout the rest of the analysis. Diagnostics for\nthe instrument set are satisfactory. Both the Sargan p-value and the 2nd order serial correlation p-\nvalue are insignificant (p-values of 0.4609 and 0.2032 respectively). Again, these values are\nsimilar for the rest of the analysis.11\nTABLE 5 HERE\nTurning to the impact of acquisition, acquirers experience significantly positive pay changes\nin the one and two years prior to acquisition. This is consistent with the evidence of Harford and\nLi (2007), who suggest that firms with overpaid CEOs have weak governance, and it is firms\nwith weak governance who are able to undertake acquisitions. The coefficient for the acquisition\nyear (Acquisition it) is also significantly positive, but it is not significantly different from the\ncoefficients for the one and two years prior to acquisition. The coefficient for the second year\nfollowing takeover completion (Acquisition it-1) is statistically insignificant, yet the coefficient\nfor the third year following completion (Acquisition it-2) is significantly negative and of a similar\nmagnitude to the positive coefficient for the acquisition year.12 Therefore for the overall sample\nof acquisitions, there is a positive change following acquisition, yet it is no different from the\nchanges prior to acquisition and is reversed in the third year following acquisition.\n10\nWe now examine whether this conclusion depends on the size of the target company, both in\nrelation to the acquirer and in absolute terms. If size increases associated with acquisition\ngrowth are rewarded more highly than size increases associated with internal growth, then the\nlarger the acquisition size (and the relative size) the more positive the effect on pay.\nFirstly, we examine the effect of the relative size of the acquisition. Column (2) of Table 5\nshows the results of a regression which relative size is included as an explanatory variable. The\nrelative size coefficient is significantly positive in the year following completion and the\nsubsequent year. However, for the third year following completion it is significantly negative.\nAcquisition relative size therefore determines both the pay increase in the acquisition year and\nalso the subsequent decline in pay. Column (3) reports the results for a regression in which the\nacquisition dummy variables employed only include acquisitions with a relative size greater than\n20%. The pre-merger year coefficients are similar to those in Column (1) but statistically\ninsignificant. However, the coefficient for the acquisition year is significantly positive and much\nlarger than in Column (1). It is significantly different from the coefficients for the two years\nprior to acquisition. Again, the coefficient for the third year following completion is\nsignificantly negative.\nSecondly, we examine how pay changes around acquisition are related to the overall sales\nchange of the acquirer, and the acquired sales of the target. This approach is similar to that of\nGirma et al. (2006), who dissect annual sales changes into those associated with acquired sales\nand internally generated sales. Target company sales data is available for only a subset (2,238)\nof the sample acquisitions. To estimate sales for the remaining 2,290 targets for which sales is\nunavailable, we firstly estimate the median transaction value to sales multiple for the 2,238\nacquisitions, which is equal to 0.89. Secondly, for the other targets we divide their transaction\nvalue by 0.89 for the estimated sales value.13 The results are reported in Column (4) of Table 5.\nThe coefficient for acquired sales is significantly positive for the acquisition year, and\nsignificantly negative for the third year following acquisition. Since this regression already\nincludes the change in acquirer sales, size increases through acquisition are clearly rewarded\n11\nsignificantly more than size increases through internal growth,14 consistent with Girma et al.,\n(2006). Column (5) reports the results for a regression in which the acquisition dummy variables\nemployed only include acquisitions with an absolute size of sales greater than \u00a3500m. The\ncoefficient for the acquisition year is significantly positive and significantly larger than the\ncoefficients for the two years prior to acquisition, whilst the coefficient for the third year is\nsignificantly negative.\nTherefore, acquisitions beyond a certain relative and absolute size have a significantly\npositive impact in the acquisition year, even relative to the positive pre-merger trend. However,\nthe pay increase in year of acquisition appears to reverse consistently two years later. This\nsuggests that the initial increase is a transitory one. One reason could be that the increase\nrepresents an increase in bonus and not salary. This explanation would be consistent with the US\nevidence of Grinstein and Hribar (2004) who show that pay increases following mergers tend to\nbe one off bonus payments.15\nA potential selection bias exists in our regressions because acquiring firms are not chosen at\nrandom from the firm population. A specification error will exist if the omitted variables that\ndetermine whether a firm acquires another firm are correlated with those that determine the pay\nincrease. To address this we use the Heckman (1979) correction. We first run a probit regression\nfor all sample firms to model the probability that a firm will undertake an acquisition. Our\nexplanatory variables are pre-merger sales, market to book ratio, ROA, dummy variable for\nwhether the firm acquired another firm in the previous year, the announcement share return of\nthat acquisition (further described below), and year dummies. We use the probit estimates to\nconstruct the Heckman variable, which when added to equation (2), corrects for a potential\ncorrelation between the error term in the probit regression and the error term in equation (2). We\ninclude the Heckman variable for the regressions in Columns (1) and (3) of Table 5. This\nvariable is insignificantly positive and significantly positive respectively in the two regressions.\nHowever, the acquisition dummy variables are of the same magnitude and statistical significance\nas in Table 5, suggesting that our results are robust to any specification error.\n12\nDoes target nationality and organizational form have an impact on acquisition pay awards?\nIn order to examine whether a differential impact on pay exists between private and public\nacquisitions, we employ an additional set of dummy variables (Acquisition public it) which are\nset equal to one if the acquisition is public, zero otherwise. Again, we include these variables for\neach of the five years surrounding acquisition as in Table 5 above. The importance of\nacquisition size in determining pay changes was displayed above, and we subsequently control\nfor relative size in the rest of the analysis. The results are reported in Column (1) of Table 6\nbelow. The coefficients for the public acquisition dummy variable are not significant for any of\nthe years surrounding acquisition. In order to check the robustness of this finding, in Column (4)\nwe restrict all acquisitions to be greater than 20% in terms of relative size. Again, the\ncoefficients are not significant. There does not, therefore, appear to be a significant difference\nbetween private and public acquisitions in terms of executive pay impacts.\nTABLE 6 HERE\nIn order to examine whether domestic and cross-border acquisitions have differential pay\nimpacts, we employ a set of dummy variables (Acquisition cross-border it) which are set equal to\none if the acquisition is cross-border, zero if domestic. In Column (2) of Table 6, we report the\nresults of these regressions. The only coefficient that is significant (at the five percent level) is\nfor the third year following acquisition (significantly negative). The same result holds when we\nrestrict all acquisitions to be greater than 20% in terms of relative size, as shown in Column (5).\nIn Columns (3) and (6) of Table 5 we include dummy variables for both cross-border and public\nacquisitions. However, this makes no difference to our conclusions regarding the pay impact of\ncross-border versus domestic (or public versus private) acquisitions. Therefore, the only\ndifference that we find between cross-border and domestic acquisitions is that the former\nexperience a significantly greater decline in pay in the second year following acquisition.16 This\nfinding runs contrary to the hypotheses described in the Introduction, which predict that cross-\nborder deals will have more positive pay impacts than domestic acquisitions. However, these\n13\nhypotheses predict that specific types of cross-border acquisitions will have larger pay impacts\nthan others, and we therefore examine such types in more detail.\nOne may expect initial cross-border acquisitions by firms to have larger pay impacts, since\ninitial cross-border acquisitions may have a marginally greater impact on the multinational\nnature and complexity of the firm, compared to subsequent cross-border acquisitions. In order to\nexamine this, we employ a dummy variable which is equal to one if an acquisition is the first\ncross-border acquisition carried out by a acquiring company, zero otherwise. The results,\nreported in Column (1) of Table 7 below, show that the coefficient for the acquisition year is\ninsignificantly positive. In Column (4) we restrict all acquisitions to be greater than 20% in\nterms of relative size. In this case, the coefficient for the acquisition year is significantly\npositive. Other coefficients are insignificant. Therefore, for relatively large acquisitions, initial\ncross-border acquisitions result in significantly higher changes than subsequent cross-border\nacquisitions. To ensure that this is not a general bid order effect, we repeat the analysis for initial\ndomestic acquisitions, but find no similar effect.17 Since previous pay studies that examine the\nimpact of multi-nationality do not examine different forms of geographic expansion, these\nresults improve our understanding of the mechanism through which international exposure\naffects pay.\nTABLE 7 HERE\nOne of the hypotheses advanced for higher pay impacts in cross-border deals is that cross-\nborder acquisitions of targets in countries with relatively high pay will result in higher pay\nchanges. To test this, we examine the differential impact of cross-border acquisitions of US\ntargets, since the US has substantially higher pay levels than the UK and represents a significant\nproportion of the sample. We employ a dummy variable that is given the value one for US\nacquisitions, zero otherwise. The results, reported in Column (2) of Table 7, show that none of\nthe coefficients for this variable are significant. Column (5) reports results for acquisitions\nwhich are greater than 20% in terms of relative size, yet the results are the same. We therefore\n14\nfind no evidence that cross-border acquisitions of targets in high pay countries result in higher\npay changes than other cross-border acquisitions.\nWe examine the key assumption underlying this hypothesis by examining the impact of target\nexecutive pay levels on acquirer pay impacts. Target pay data is only available for UK public\ntargets (collected from Datastream) and US public target data (collected from 14A company\nfilings on the SEC Edgar Database). We collect the highest paid director\u2019s cash compensation\n(salary and bonus) for 527 UK public targets and 41 US public targets. For every deal year, we\ncreate a dummy variable which is set equal to one if the target highest director pay is higher than\nthe acquirer\u2019s highest director pay, zero otherwise. Of the 568 acquisitions with data available,\n112 have target pay greater than the acquirer pay. The results are shown in Column (3) of Table\n7. The coefficient for this dummy variable for the second year following acquisition is\nsignificantly positive, whilst coefficients for other years are statistically insignificant. Column\n(6) reports regressions for acquisitions which are greater than 20% in terms of relative size. The\nresults are again very similar. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that where the\nacquirer's level of pay is lower than that of the acquiree, there is a tendency for the acquirer's\npay to gravitate towards the acquiree's levels following acquisition\nAre CEOs really motivated to carry out (bad) acquisitions by executive pay considerations?\nIn this section, we examine whether acquisition propensity is influenced by prior acquisition pay\nawards and whether executive pay and CEO wealth increases following poor acquisitions.\nIf CEOs carry out acquisitions in order to increase pay, then it follows that those CEOs who\nhave been most highly compensated for past acquisitions may be more likely to make future\nacquisitions. We estimate a logit model in which the dependent variable is one if a firm carries\nout an acquisition in the next financial year, zero otherwise. We include sales, profitability, and\nMTBV as independent variables since previous studies show they impact positively on\nacquisition propensity (Hughes, 1989). We allow for the fact that some firms are predisposed to\nmake acquisitions by including a dummy variable set equal to one if there is an acquisition in the\ncurrent year, zero otherwise. The quality of a previous merger may affect acquisition propensity\n15\nand we therefore include current year acquisition performance, measured as the cumulative\nannouncement returns (CARs) to the acquiring firm for the 3-day period (-1, 1) around the\nannouncement date (see e.g., Girma et al., 2006), where the benchmark return is the Datastream\nequal weighted market index. If there is more than one acquisition within the year, we use the\nsum of CARs. We use two compensation measures as explanatory variables. Firstly, we estimate\nequation (2) without the acquisition variables, and use the residuals as a measure of abnormal\ncompensation (Abnormal pay). Secondly, to measure prior acquisition abnormal pay we use\nabnormal pay if there is an acquisition in the current year, zero otherwise (Abnormal pay *\nacquisition). The equation we estimate is as follows;\nAcquisition it+1 = \u03b2 0 + \u03b21 ln Sales it + \u03b22 ROA it + \u03b23 MTBV it\n(3) + \u03b24 Acquisition it + \u03b25 CAR it + \u03b26 Abnormal pay it\n+ \u03b27 Abnormal pay it * acquisition it + h it + e it\nThe results, reported in Column (1) of Table 8, show that future acquisition activity is\nsignificantly positively related to prior sales, ROA, MTBV, CAR, prior abnormal pay and\nabnormal pay associated with acquisitions. In Column (3) we rerun the regressions for\nacquisitions in which relative size is greater than 20%. In this case, the coefficient on Abnormal\npay * acquisition is not statistically significant. Therefore our results are not conclusive here.\nTABLE 8 HERE\nIn order to examine this further we use as our dependent variable not whether an acquisition\nis made in the subsequent year but the relative size of that acquisition. The results are reported in\nColumns (2) and (4) of Table 8. In this case the coefficient for Abnormal pay * acquisition is\nalways significantly positive, suggesting that acquirers who earn high abnormal pay from prior\nacquisitions are more likely to carry out relatively large future deals. This evidence overall is\nconsistent with Rosen (2004), who finds that excess pay associated with prior mergers results in\na higher likelihood of future acquisitions.\nTo examine whether acquirer CEOs are rewarded differently for good and bad acquisitions\nwe firstly employ a dummy variable that is set equal to one if the acquisition has a negative\n16\nCAR, zero otherwise.18 We include this variable for both the acquisition year and the subsequent\ntwo years to allow for lag effects. The results, reported in Column (1) of Table 9 below, show\nthat these coefficients are all statistically insignificant. The results in Column (4), for which all\nacquisitions must be greater than 20% in terms of relative size, are similar. Secondly, Columns\n(2) and (3), report the pay impacts for those acquisitions which have a negative CAR, both with\nand without controlling for relative size, respectively. In both columns there is a significantly\npositive effect on pay in the year following acquisition, and a significantly negative effect two\nyears after acquisition. Columns (5) and (6) show similar results for those acquisitions which are\ngreater than 20% in terms of relative size. These results for negative CAR acquisitions are very\nsimilar to those for the overall sample of acquisitions.19 We therefore find no difference in pay\nimpacts between good and bad acquisitions, and pay impacts are significantly positive for both\nwealth creative and wealth destructive acquisitions.20 This finding has important implications for\nthe motivations of CEOs carrying out acquisitions, since CEOs appear able to increase their pay,\neven if acquisitions destroy shareholder value.\nTABLE 9 HERE\nDespite this, CEOs may not be motivated to make poor acquisitions if there is an offsetting\nnegative effect on the value of their own shareholdings, and we therefore examine the overall\neffect on both pay and the value of shares and incentive shares. Information on shareholdings for\na subset of acquisitions (1,001 sample acquisitions between 1989 and 1998) is drawn from the\ndataset employed by Conn et al. (2007), which contains the number of shares and incentive\nshares owned by CEOs in the last financial year prior to the first acquisition in a merger series.\nA merger series is defined as one or more mergers followed by a period of at least 36 months\nwith no mergers. To estimate the impact on share value, we firstly multiply the acquirer\u2019s\nmarket value (at year beginning) by the acquisition CAR, and then multiply this by the\npercentage of shares owned. To estimate the impact on incentive share value, we multiply the\nformer value by the percentage of incentive shares owned. We therefore assume that a 1%\nincrease (decrease) in share value will increase (decrease) incentive shares by 1%. Our\n17\nestimation of the change in pay due to acquisition is Abnormal pay, as described above. To\nestimate the abnormal change in sterling (rather than logs), we multiply the inverse of Abnormal\npay by Pay t-1, and subtract Pay t-1. The impact on overall wealth is the sum of the pay change in\nthe acquisition year and the change in the value of share and incentive shares. The results for all\nacquisitions are shown in Panel A of Table 10, whilst those with a relative size of greater than\n20% are shown in Panel B.\nTABLE 10 HERE\nFor all acquisitions, the average abnormal pay increase in the year of acquisition is \u00a321,680.\nThe average impact on both CEO shareholding value and incentive share value is significantly\npositive (\u00a324,180 and \u00a311,750 respectively). However, median impacts are much smaller, and\nare much smaller in size than pay impacts. Results in Panel B are very similar. Results for both\npanels show no significant difference in pay changes between negative and positive CAR\nacquisitions. However, negative CAR acquisitions have a significantly negative effect on the\nshare and incentive share value, which is greater than the pay increase, such that the average\n(median) impact on overall CEO wealth is a statistically significant -\u00a382,590 (-\u00a38,810). In\ncontrast, positive CAR acquisitions have a significantly positive effect on overall CEO wealth,\nwith an average (median) increase of \u00a3163,020 (\u00a344,540). The difference between negative and\npositive CAR acquisitions is statistically significant. A similar pattern is shown in Panel B. Our\nresults show that CEOs on average suffer a significant decline in wealth from carrying out bad\nacquisitions.\nAre acquisition pay awards the result of weak corporate governance?\nWe examine whether the pay changes around acquisition are the result of agency problems by\nexamining whether they are larger for acquirers with weak corporate governance. We employ\nseven corporate governance measures comprising board size, proportion of non-executive\ndirectors, CEO tenure as board director, whether the CEO is also chairman, CEO share\nownership, board share ownership, and off board ownership. The first two measures, board size\nand the number of non-executive directors are collected from Datastream. Board size is\n18\navailable for the entire sample, and the number of non-executive directors is available for 14,958\nfirm year observations. The other five measures are drawn from the dataset employed by Conn\net al., (2007) described above.21\nWe test the impact of each governance variable separately on the pay changes around\nacquisition, by classifying acquirers according to whether they have weak governance as\nfollows; Board size greater than median board size (7) for all sample observations; Acquirer\nproportion of non-executives less than median (0.40) for 14,958 sample observations; Acquirer\nCEO tenure greater than median acquirer (3.93 years); Acquirer CEO also Chairman; Acquirer\nCEO ownership less than median acquirer (0.5%); Acquirer board ownership less than median\nacquirer (7.6%); Acquirer largest off board holding less than median acquirer (10.0%). We run\nseven separate regressions identical to Column (2) of Table 5, in which we include an additional\ndummy variable which is equal to the acquisition dummy variable if the acquirer has weak\ncorporate governance for the particular variable, and zero otherwise. The acquisition dummy\nvariables and relative size variables are only set equal to one and the relative size respectively, if\nthe governance data is available for the firm year observation. The results are reported in Table\n11 below. Panel A reports results for all acquisitions, whilst Panel B reports results for\nacquisitions in which relative size is greater than 20%.\nTABLE 11 HERE\nThere is little evidence that acquirers with weak corporate governance experience larger pay\nincreases around acquisition. In the year immediately following acquisition, only two of the\nseven coefficients are significantly positive. Acquirers with high CEO tenure tend to experience\nsignificantly higher increases in pay. However, this would appear to be the continuation of a\ntrend because the coefficient for this variable is also significantly positive in the two years prior\nto acquisition. Furthermore, the difference between the coefficient for the acquisition year and\nthe year prior to acquisition is not significant. The other significant coefficient is that for low\nexternal ownership. The results reported in Panel B are similar, although the coefficient for low\nexternal ownership is not significant. Pay changes around acquisition are not significantly\n19\naffected by the strength of corporate governance, and hence would not appear to be a\nmanifestation of weak corporate governance.\nIII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this study we examine the impact of a comprehensive sample of acquisitions on executive\ncompensation. It is the analysis of this comprehensive sample, which includes foreign, domestic,\npublic and private acquisition targets, that marks our key contribution to the literature. Previous\nstudies in contrast examine only acquisitions of domestic public targets, which account for less\nthan 13 percent of our sample. Ours is the first study therefore to provide evidence on\nacquisition pay impacts which are robust to the inclusion of all acquisition types. We find that\nacquisitions result in significant pay increases in the year following acquisition, but that the\nincrease is transitory and offset by a similar decline two years after acquisition, consistent with\nthe initial increase representing a one off bonus payment rather than a permanent salary increase.\nA number of reasons have been advanced as to why cross-border and public acquisitions will\nhave relatively high pay impacts. We provide the first comparison of these different types of\nacquisition. Although cross-border acquisitions increase international exposure, and such\nexposure is linked generally to higher pay, we find no evidence of higher pay increases relative\nto domestic acquisitions. However, we do find that initial cross-border acquisitions, which\npresumably have a greater impact on the firm\u2019s international exposure than subsequent ones,\nresult in higher pay changes. Therefore, cross-border acquisitions do appear to have a larger\nimpact on pay when increases in international exposure are important. We find no evidence of\ndifferences between public and private acquisitions.\nWe find that acquisitions of target firms with higher pay levels than the acquirer result in\nhigher pay changes. Since the majority of cross-border targets are from the US, which has higher\npay levels than the UK, one may expect to observe higher pay increases following US\nacquisitions, yet we find no evidence of this. Such pay disparities between acquirer and target do\n20\nnot appear frequent enough to affect average outcomes, and as such, mergers are unlikely to\nbring about convergence of UK executive pay levels to US levels as some authors have argued.\nOne of the primary considerations of the extant literature is whether motivations exist to\nmake acquisitions, even wealth destructive ones, because of executive pay considerations. Ours\nis the first study to consider these issues for a comprehensive acquisition sample. We find that\nacquirers that are paid more following acquisition are more likely to carry out future and\nrelatively large acquisitions. There is no evidence that pay changes are related to acquisition\nperformance, and bad and good acquisitions result in similar pay increases. However, in wealth\ndestroying acquisitions, the decline in CEO share value far outweighs the increase in executive\npay and therefore distorted incentives do not appear to exist, given average CEO shareholdings,\nfor acquirers to pursue wealth destroying acquisitions. Finally, we find no evidence that pay\nawards around acquisition are greater when corporate governance is weaker, and therefore no\nevidence that acquisition pay awards are a manifestation of poor corporate governance.\n21\nFIGURE 1\nINTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF CEO PAY LEVELS AND STRUCTURES\n-\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\nCountry\nC\nE\nO\npa\ny\n(U\nS$\nth\nou\nsa\nnd\ns)\nB a s ic c o m pe ns a tio n Va ria ble bo nus Lo ng-te rm inc e ntive s Othe r\nNote: Data from Towers Perrin\u2019s Worldwide Total Reward report, 1999.

The positive connection between compensation and firm size can be explained by efficiency reasons such as\nmatching theory and tournament theory (Rosen, 1992), and in the context of an acquisition because the merger\nintegration process is more complex and requires more work (Demsetz, 1995).\n2. Kroll et al. (1990), Kroll et al. (1997), and Wright et al. (2002) show that a positive relation between\ncompensation and acquisition performance only holds when corporate governance is strong.\n3. Furthermore, they have differential impacts on performance; Cross-border deals under perform domestic deals,\nwhilst public deals under perform private deals (Conn et al., 2005).\n4. Anecdotal evidence of large increases in executive compensation following cross-border acquisitions has caught\nthe attention of the media. For example, following the cross-border acquisitions of Mannesmann and AirTouch\nby Vodafone in 2000, Vodafone CEO Chris Gent was awarded a \u00a310m special bonus which was defended on\nthe grounds that Vodafone\u2019s executives were poorly paid compared with those in America, and should be\nentitled to \u201ccatch up\u201d payments (The Economist, 15th July 2000, pp. 20-21).\n5. For these reasons some authors have argued that cross-border acquisitions will be a significant factor in causing\nexecutive pay levels to converge over time towards the highest common denominator, in particular that of the\nUS (Cheffins and Thomas, 2004).\n6. Cross-border acquisitions in high pay countries may increase pay because acquirer executives gain the\nexperience necessary to compete for positions and remuneration at target country firms, or because target\ncountry firms become included as peer group firms used to determine pay levels (Cheffins and Thomas, 2004).\n7. Agency-theory models predict that if diffuse private owners find it harder than large private owners to monitor\nexecutive effort, they will need to pay more to induce optimal effort levels (Ke et al., 1999).\n8. We employed different instruments for \u2206 ln Pay it-1, including a greater number of lags of pay levels (ln Pay it-\n3 and ln Pay it-4), and the lagged pay change (\u2206 ln Pay it-2). The results were similar using these methods.\n9. Deal values in foreign currency were converted to sterling using the exchange rate at the announcement month.\n10. The variables in Tables 3 and 4, and employed in the subsequent analysis are expressed in 2001 sterling values\n(deflated using the UK Retail Price Index) and winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to remove outliers.\n11. In additional tests we employed different explanatory variables. We replaced profitability with the annual share\nreturn, and included the standard deviation of share returns as a risk measure. These variables have coefficients\nof 0.028 (p-value of 0.000) and -0.166 (p-value of 0.000) respectively. We also employed industry dummy\nvariables to control for different industry pay levels. Our key conclusions are not affected by their inclusion.\n34\n12. In additional tests, we also included dummy variables for years t-4, t-3, t+3, and t+4. The coefficients for these\nvariables were close to zero and statistically insignificant.\n13. As a robustness check, we recalculated our results using only the 2,238 acquisitions for which target sales data\nis available. The results are very similar.\n14. One concern is that acquirer sales will not reflect fully the sales of the new merged entity in the acquisition year\nbecause, under acquisition accounting, target sales are included only from the acquisition date. A significantly\npositive coefficient could therefore simply be picking up an effect of sales that will be reflected in following\nyears. To check this potential bias we employ market and book values instead, yet find very similar results.\n15. Girma et al. (2006) find that hostile acquisitions experience a negative impact two years after acquisition.\nHowever, the decline we observe can not be explained by hostile acquisitions, since the decline also holds for\nprivate acquisitions, all of which are friendly in nature.\n16. Since target size is an important determinant of pay increases, and target size is greater in public and cross-\nborder acquisitions, one would expect that public and cross-border acquisitions have a greater impact on pay\nwhen target size is not controlled for. To check this, we estimate Columns (1)-(6) of Table 6 without the\nrelative size variables. However, the results are very similar to those in Table 6.\n17. Since our sample contains multiple acquirers, we examine the relation between pay impacts and the order of an\nacquisition within a merger series. Previous studies (see e.g., Conn et al., 2007) have found that performance\nimpacts decline with acquisition order for multiple acquirers. We include the bid order as an explanatory\nvariable in Column (1) of Table 5. The coefficient has a value of 0.006 and is statistically insignificant (p-value\nof 0.177). Therefore we find no evidence that pay impacts are associated with bid order.\n18. The average CAR for the entire sample of acquisitions is 0.96 percent. 51.26 percent of the sample acquisitions\nhave a positive CAR, whilst 48.74 have a negative CAR.\n19. We also examine the relation between pay changes and the CAR itself, thus considering CAR magnitude and\nnot just its sign. The coefficient for this variable is statistically insignificant (value of 0.24, p-value of 0.79).\n20. We re-estimated the regressions in Columns (1) and (4) of Table 8, including dummy variables for public and\ncross-border acquisitions, as in Table 6. The coefficients are very similar to those in Table 6, and hence\nconclusions on the impact of public and cross-border deals are robust to controlling for acquisition\nperformance.\n21. Data is available for the year prior to acquisition for the following number of acquisitions: CEO tenure (643),\nCEO-chairman (1,231), CEO ownership (1,001), board ownership (1,230), and off board ownership (1,230).\n35\nREFERENCES\nANDERSON, C., BECHER, D.
