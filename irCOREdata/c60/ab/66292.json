Introduction\n[2] Most passive margins are segmented along strike,\ngiving rise to discrete zones characterized by constancy in\nstructural style [e.g., Francheteau and Le Pichon, 1972;\nDore\u00b4 et al., 1997; Clemson et al., 1997; Song et al., 2001].\nThis segmentation is also seen in continental rifts that are\nthe precursor to these passive margins [e.g., Rosendahl,\n1987; Morley et al., 1990]. The boundaries between margin\/\nrift segments are generally believed to exhibit a variety of\nstructural styles ranging from transfer faults [Gibbs, 1984]\nand accommodation zones [Bosworth et al., 1986] to\ntransform faults. The origins of this segmentation and\nsegment boundary zones are often attributed to the influence\nof basement structure [e.g., Davison, 1997; Clemson et al.,\n1997]. One possibility is that such segmentation reflects\nalong-strike changes in the orientation of preexisting struc-\ntures in the underlying continental basement. A corollary of\nthis model is that if such preexisting structures undergo\nreactivation then they will often be significantly oblique to\nthe direction of regional extension. This leads to the\ndevelopment of zones of oblique extension or transtension\non what would otherwise be a simple extensional margin\n[Dewey, 2002; Morley et al., 2004].\n[3] Transtension may be described as oblique extension\nwhich combines coaxial orthogonal extension and noncoax-\nial deformation zone parallel shear [Sanderson andMarchini,\n1984; Dewey, 2002]. Transtensional strain will occur when\nbulk displacement is at an oblique angle a to the deforma-\ntion zone boundary faults (Figure 1a). Pure shear coaxial\nextension (a = 90\u0001) and noncoaxial wrench simple shear\n(a = 0\u0001) represent the end-member strain states for trans-\ntension, both of which lead to plane strain (two-dimensional)\ndeformation. Transtension (0\u0001 < a < 90\u0001) on the other hand\nresults in noncoaxial three-dimensional (3-D) strain [De\nPaola et al., 2005a]. Transtensional strains are characterized\nby complex relationships between finite and infinitesimal\nstrain axes that critically depend on the angle a (Figure 1). In\nextension-dominated transtension (20\u0001 < a < 90\u0001) the axes of\ninfinitesimal (z) and finite shortening (Z) should always be\ncoincident and vertical, which is comparable to the case of\northogonal extension (a = 90\u0001) (Figures 1b) [McCoss, 1986;\nSmith andDurney, 1992;DePaola et al., 2005a]. However, at\nlow angles of divergence (a < 20\u0001), the infinitesimal axis z is\nTECTONICS, VOL. 25, TC4018, doi:10.1029\/2005TC001895, 2006\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Reactivation Research Group, Department of Earth Sciences, Uni-\nversity of Durham, Durham, UK.\n2Geospatial Research Ltd., Department of Earth Sciences, University of\nDurham, Durham, UK.\n3e-Science Research Institute, University of Durham, Durham, UK.\n4Statoil ASA, Stavanger, Norway.\n5Geological Survey of Norway, Trondheim, Norway.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0278-7407\/06\/2005TC001895$12.00\nTC4018 1 of 28\nhorizontal, with the finite axis (Z) eventually swapping\norientation with the vertical intermediate finite axis Y with\nincreasing amounts of finite strain (\u2018\u2018wrench-dominated\ntranstension\u2019\u2019; Figure 1b). It is not surprising, therefore, that\nboth field- and laboratory-based studies of deformation styles\nin oblique and transtensional settings have shown that these\nzones exhibit more complex fault patterns than those tradi-\ntionally associated with orthogonal rifting [e.g.,Withjack and\nJamison, 1986; Schreurs and Colletta, 1998; Clifton et al.,\n2000; McClay et al., 2002; Dewey, 2002; De Paola et al.,\n2005a]. Furthermore, the presence of preexisting structures\nlying at an oblique angle to imposed opening vectors may\ncommonly lead to the partitioning of oblique rifting into\ncontemporaneous domains of wrench- and extension-domi-\nnated transtension [Titus et al., 2002;Oldow, 2003;De Paola\net al., 2005b].\n[4] The Norwegian continental margin is a well docu-\nmented example of a segmented passive margin [Dore\u00b4 et\nal., 1997; Tsikalas et al., 2001; Olesen et al., 2002; Mosar,\n2003]. This segmentation is generally defined by the pres-\nence of a series of approximately NW-SE trending cross-\nmargin accommodation\/transfer zones (Figures 2a and 2b)\n[Blystad et al., 1995; Olesen et al., 1997, 2002; Brekke,\n2000; Tsikalas et al., 2001]. These transfer zones are\nbelieved to reflect major basement structures at depth\n[Stro\u00a8mberg, 1976; Mjelde et al., 2003]. This appears to be\ntrue for the largest transfer zones (e.g., Jan Mayen, Bivrost,\nSenja fracture zones), which we term here first-order\ntransfer zones. However, others are simply inferred across\nareas of changing fault trend, fault polarity or basin geom-\netry (e.g., Mosken and Jannegga transfer zones) [Tsikalas et\nal., 2001], and in many cases no attributable basement\nstructure is observed. These we term second-order transfer\nzones, and they are more comparable to accommodation\nzones and twist zones [Colletta et al., 1988; Peacock et al.,\n2000].\n[5] In this paper, we shall use integrated regional to\noutcrop-scale onshore and offshore studies to investigate\nthe variations in fault pattern and structural style across a\nzone of increasing obliquity relative to the regional exten-\nsion vector. Furthermore, we investigate the hypothesis that\nit is the orientation of individual ridge\/margin segments, and\ntheir bounding faults, relative to regional extension that\ncontrols fault complexity and the development of second-\norder transfer structures.\n[6] The Lofoten Ridge (Figure 2b) is a basement ridge\nshowing distinct lateral variations in trend, and provides a\ngood opportunity to compare fault architectures found in\ncrystalline basement onshore [Tveten and Zwaan, 1993;\nL\u00f8seth and Tveten, 1996; Olesen et al., 1997; Klein and\nSteltenpohl, 1999; Steltenpohl et al., 2004], with those\ndeveloped in sedimentary basins offshore [Mokhtari and\nPegrum, 1992; L\u00f8seth and Tveten, 1996; Tsikalas et al.,\n2001]. The Lofoten Ridge has been strongly affected by\ntectonic activity during the Late Mesozoic extension prior to\nthe separation of Norway and Greenland and, given its\ncurved geometry, is an ideal location to look for evidence of\nbasement-influenced oblique extension. The area is also an\nexcellent analogue for offshore basement fault blocks be-\nneath the Norwegian and other passive margins.\n[7] In the present study, we apply new digital mapping\nworkflows [Jones et al., 2004;Wilson et al., 2005;McCaffrey\net al., 2005] to construct a structural database for both\nonshore and offshore structures on the Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen\narchipelago (LVA; Figure 2c). All data are stored digitally in\na Geographic Information System (GIS) database that\nfacilitates the interpretation of multiple\/integrated data sets\n(e.g., seismic data, remote sensing, field mapping [Jones et\nal., 2004; Piazolo et al., 2004]). It also provides an ability to\nanalyze structures spatially across a wide range of scales.\n2. Regional Setting\n2.1. Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen Margin\n[8] Past studies have shown that the Norwegian conti-\nnental margin can be divided into a series of segments\n(M\u00f8re, V\u00f8ring, Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen, and Western Barents\nSea margins; Figure 2) [Talwani and Eldholm, 1977; Olesen\net al., 1997; Dore\u00b4 et al., 1999; Brekke, 2000; Mosar, 2003].\nThe Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen Margin segment lies between the\nFigure 1.

[2001]).\nTC4018 WILSON ET AL.: TRANSTENSION AND SEGMENTATION IN LOFOTEN\n3 of 28\nTC4018\nBivrost and Senja fracture zones (Figure 2) [Eldholm et al.,\n1979; Tsikalas et al., 2001]. Compared to its neighboring\nmargin segments, the Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen Margin has a\nrelatively narrow continental shelf and steep slope. Seismic\nand geophysical studies in this segment show a rift complex\nof margin-parallel basement ridges and shallow Mesozoic\nbasins [Mokhtari and Pegrum, 1992; L\u00f8seth and Tveten,\n1996; Olesen et al., 1997, 2002; Tsikalas et al., 2001].\nTsikalas et al. [2001] further subdivide the margin into a\nseries of intramargin segments based on changes in fault\npolarity and intensity. These intramargin segments are\nthought to be separated by transfer zones (Jannegga,\nVestera\u02dalen; Figure 2a), also identified by Olesen et al.\n[1997, 2002].\n[9] The Norwegian margin has a prolonged Paleozoic to\nCenozoic history of intermittent extension and basin forma-\ntion dating from the Devonian postorogenic (i.e., post-\nScandian) collapse of the Caledonide mountain belt [Fossen\nand Dunlap, 1998; Dore\u00b4 et al., 1999; Fossen, 2000].\nRegional extension episodes have been documented in the\nDevono-Carboniferous, Permian, through the Late Jurassic\nto Early Cretaceous, and in Late Cretaceous to Early\nCenozoic times [Blystad et al., 1995; Lundin and Dore\u00b4,\n1997; Brekke, 2000]. The last extensional event is consid-\nered to have culminated in continental breakup and massive\nigneous activity at the Paleocene-Eocene transition, \u000155Ma\n[Eldholm et al., 1989; Skogseid et al., 1992, 2000; Eide,\n2002; Ren et al., 2003].\n[10] Late Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous rifting is the domi-\nnant tectonic episode that gave rise to the prominent NE-\nSW trending faults on the margin [Blystad et al., 1995; Dore\u00b4\net al., 1999; Brekke, 2000, Tsikalas et al., 2001, Mosar,\n2003]. There are two dominant NE-SW oriented ridges on\nthe Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen Margin: the Lofoten Ridge and\nthe Utr\u00f8st Ridge (Figures 2a and 2c). Extensive synrift\nthickening of Lower Cretaceous sequences is apparent\nalong faults bordering the western flank of the Lofoten\nRidge, indicating that tectonism was active until about\nHauterivian time, \u0001130 Ma [Dore\u00b4 et al., 1999; Tsikalas et\nal., 2001].\n2.2. Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen Archipelago\n[11] The inner Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen margin is dominated\nby the Lofoten Ridge, which can be split into three sections\n(north, central, and south) showing variations in trend\n(Figure 2a). With the exception of a few small islands\n(e.g., R\u00f8st and V\u00e6r\u00f8y), the south Lofoten Ridge lies below\nsea level (Figure 2a), whereas the central and north Lofoten\nRidge make up part of the Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen archipelago\n(LVA) (Figure 2b). Collectively, the ridge marks a promi-\nnent NE-SW trending horst, bound on both sides by\ndeep sedimentary basins (Vestfjorden and Ribban basins)\n[Mokhtari and Pegrum, 1992; Blystad et al., 1995; L\u00f8seth\nand Tveten, 1996]. The archipelago is composed mainly of\nhigh-grade metamorphic Precambrian rocks [Griffin et al.,\n1978] which have undergone a multistage exhumation\nhistory [Griffin et al., 1978; Hendriks, 2003]. The exposed\nrocks are mainly migmatitic gneisses that were metamor-\nphosed to amphibolite and granulite facies, and extensively\nintruded by mangeritic and charnockitic plutons [Griffin et\nal., 1978; Corfu, 2004a]. U-Pb dating of these plutons\nsuggest that the main phase of emplacement was between\n1800 and 1790 Ma [Corfu, 2004a] and make up the bulk of\nthe rocks exposed in north Lofoten (i.e., on Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya and\nVestva\u02dag\u00f8ya) [Tveten, 1978; Corfu, 2004a]. Basement fab-\nrics within these rocks are somewhat variable, both in trend\nand intensity, along the ridge [Tveten, 1978]. Unlike other\nexposures of the Western Gneiss Region, the Caledonian\nfabrics are only weakly developed in these basement\nrocks of the LVA [Griffin et al., 1978; Tull et al., 1985;\nSteltenpohl et al., 2004]. This has been attributed to the lack\nof fluids in the dry granulite facies basement in the area\n[Bartley, 1982; Olesen et al., 1997]. Separating these\nPrecambrian basement terranes from the Caledonian nappe\nsequences to the east are a series of steeply dipping brittle-\nductile to cataclastic faults called the Vestfjorden-Vanna\nfault complex (Figure 2) [Andresen and Forslund, 1987;\nOlesen et al., 1997]. This fault zone has been attributed to\nLate Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous movements [Andresen and\nForslund, 1987], although older Permian movements have\nalso been suggested [Olesen et al., 1997; Steltenpohl et al.,\n2004].\n[12] The only onshore exposures of nonbasement rocks\ncan be found on And\u00f8ya [Dalland, 1981], where Jurassic\nand Lower Cretaceous sediments outcrop. Similar age sedi-\nments have also been documented from within fjords on\nVestera\u02dalen [e.g., Davidsen et al., 2001].\n[13] A large fault defines the western flank of the Lofoten\nRidge (the West Lofoten Border Fault, WLBF [L\u00f8seth and\nTveten, 1996]), and also forms the major bounding fault to\nthe Ribban Basin offshore (Figure 2). This basin is\nsubdivided into the Skomv\u00e6r and Havba\u02daen subbasins\n(Figure 2b) [Mokhtari and Pegrum, 1992; Olesen et al.,\n1997; Tsikalas et al., 2001]. In places, the WLBF has a\ncumulative throw to the west or NW in excess of 3 km\n[Tsikalas et al., 2001]. Traced northward, the WLBF\nchanges orientation from a NNE-SSW trend to NE-SW\/\nENE-WSW trend between Moskenes\u00f8ya and Vestva\u02dag\u00f8ya\n(Figure 2b), and this is reflected in the overall trend of the\nLofoten Ridge. This change is coincident with an apparent\nchange in fault polarity within the Ribban Basin from\ndominantly NW dipping in the south to dominantly SE\ndipping in the north [Tsikalas et al., 2001]. It also coincides\nwith a decrease in throw on the Eastern Lofoten Border\nFault (ELBF; Figure 2b) northward. These observations led\nboth Tsikalas et al. [2001] and Olesen et al. [2002] to infer a\ntransfer zone through the area (Figures 2a and 2b); however,\nthe exact trend and location are still debated.\n[14] Another major transfer zone has been inferred to run\nthrough Vestera\u02dalen [Olesen et al., 1997, 2002; Tsikalas et\nal., 2001]. However, apart from a few discrete NW-SE\ntrending strike-slip faults running across Vestera\u02dalen that\nmay be associated with this transfer structure, no major\ntransverse fault is apparent. The transfer zone is instead\ncharacterized by an apparent regional barrier to the propa-\ngation of NE-SW faults [Olesen et al., 1997]. This region\nhas been described as a \u2018\u2018twist zone\u2019\u2019 by Olesen et al. [1997,\n2002], and is comparable to the \u2018\u2018transfer zones\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018ac-\nTC4018 WILSON ET AL.: TRANSTENSION AND SEGMENTATION IN LOFOTEN\n4 of 28\nTC4018\ncommodation zones\u2019\u2019 described by Peacock et al. [2000].\nAlso spatially coincident with this inferred transfer zone on\nVestera\u02dalen is a steep magnetic gradient oriented NNW-SSE\nwith a positive anomaly to the west and a negative anomaly\nto the east. This boundary has been attributed to the\nprograde metamorphic transition from amphibolite-facies\nmigmatites in the east to granulite-facies rocks in the west\n[Griffin et al., 1978; Olesen et al., 1991]. However, Corfu\n[2004b] has proposed alternatively that this gradient marks\na major Caledonian tectonic boundary on Vestera\u02dalen.\n[15] All transfer zones that have been inferred in the\nregion (Figure 2) are based on changes in fault polarity and\nsediment thickness offshore [Tsikalas et al., 2001], and\nvariation in crustal structure onshore [L\u00f8seth and Tveten,\n1996; Olesen et al., 1997, 2002]. All follow a preferred\nNNW-SSE to NW-SE orientation, which may be linked\nto the influence of Proterozoic shear zones within base-\nment (e.g., the Bothnian-Senja Fault Zone, Figure 2b)\n[Henkel, 1991; Lundin and Dore\u00b4, 1997; Olesen et al.,\n1997; Fichler et al., 1999]. These transfers have also been\nspeculatively linked to fracture zones far offshore that\nsupposedly offset early magnetic anomalies generated dur-\ning seafloor spreading [Lister et al., 1991; Tsikalas et al.,\n2001], although the results of new aeromagnetic surveys\nnow question the existence of these oceanic fracture zones\nthat coincide with these \u2018\u2018second-order\u2019\u2019 transfers [Olesen et\nal., 2005].\n[16] Apatite fission track (AFT) data, radiometric dating\nand onshore analysis all suggest that the basement rocks of\nLofoten and Vestera\u02dalen experienced similar post-Caledonian\nhistories until the Late Paleozoic [Hames and Anderson,\n1996; Klein and Steltenpohl, 1999]. Subsequently, these\ntwo areas appear to have undergone differential vertical\nmovements [Hendriks and Andriessen, 2002]. Again seg-\nmentation is apparent, with different cooling and denudation\nhistories found throughout the archipelago. AFT analysis in\ncentral and north Lofoten and Vestera\u02dalen suggest that outer\nVestera\u02dalen (i.e., Lang\u00f8ya) was exhumed (based on cooling\nages) in Permo-Triassic times, whereas analyses in north\nLofoten (and possibly also inner Vestera\u02dalen) suggest Juras-\nsic-Cretaceous denudation ages [Hendriks and Andriessen,\n2002; Hendriks, 2003], at a time when Lang\u00f8ya was\nsubsiding and covered by sediments [Davidsen et al.,\n2001]. Central Lofoten shows evidence for cooling in\nMid-Cretaceous times [Hendriks and Andriessen, 2002].\nHendriks and Andriessen [2002] proposed that the transfer\nzones have in some way accommodated these differential\nvertical movements, although the precise mechanism to\naccount for such movements is not explained.\n3. Methods and Data Acquisition\n3.1. GIS Database\n[17] In any study where both onshore and offshore fault\ndata are examined at a range of scales it will be advanta-\ngeous to use a Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS\nis an information system used to input, store, retrieve,\nmanipulate, analyze and visualize geographically referenced\ngeospatial data [Longley et al., 2001]. In this study we\ncompiled remote sensing, fieldwork and offshore seismic\nreflection data sets in a single GIS database using the\nArcGISTM suite. All data are geospatially located in a\nconsistent coordinate system (WGS 84 UTM zone 33). This\ndigital workflow forms part of a new in-house mapping\nmethodology, Geospatial Acquisition, Visualization and\nAnalysis (GAVA) [Clegg et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2005;\nMcCaffrey et al., 2005] which integrates field- and labora-\ntory-based digital mapping methodologies and allows for\ncontinual data analysis and evaluation at every stage in the\ndata gathering process.\n3.2. Onshore (\u2018\u2018Surface\u2019\u2019) Data Set\n[18] Regional-scale structures have been mapped using\nremote sensing techniques, particularly lineament analysis,\nand the digitization of preexisting geological maps. Fault\nstructures at this scale were interpreted from Landsat\nthematic mapper (TM) data. The application of lineament\nanalysis for the interpretation of geological structures is a\nwell established method that has been widely applied in\nNorway [e.g., Gabrielsen and Ramberg, 1979; Karpuz et\nal., 1993, 1995; Gabrielsen et al., 2002]. Lineaments were\npicked from Landsat images along the LVA at a scale of\n1:100,000. Attribute data (i.e., trend; length; offset; com-\nments) were also recorded and stored in the GIS database.\nAfter interpretation, lineaments were then compared to a\ndigital terrain model (DTM) and refined using GIS analysis.\nParticular care was taken to avoid the inclusion of basement\nfabrics in the lineament database. This was confirmed by\nstudying preexisting geological maps during lineament\nanalysis, and was additionally checked during fieldwork.\n[19] Outcrop-scale structures were collected using\nsome of the new digital geological techniques outlined by\nMcCaffrey et al. [2005]. Digital methods are becoming a\ncommon means of field data acquisition [Maerten et al.,\n2001; Hodgetts et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2004; Clegg et al.,\n2005]. This is in part because the equipment and software\nrequired now meet the needs of the field geologist (e.g.,\nportability, accuracy, versatility, cost, etc. [Edmondo, 2002;\nWilson et al., 2005]), but also because it is becoming\nincreasingly recognized that having precise geospatially\nlocated field data enables efficient 3-D visualization and\nanalysis in ways that are not possible with data collected\nusing traditional paper-based notebook collection methods\n[McCaffrey et al., 2005]. Gathering outcrop data in digital\nformat (compatible with standard software used in the\nhydrocarbon industry) is a prerequisite for efficient com-\nparison between onshore and offshore data.\n[20] The equipment used for data capture during geolog-\nical fieldwork in Lofoten comprised the following: (1) a\nhand-held computer (HP Jornada PDA) equipped with\nmobile GIS Software; (2) a backpack mounted Differential\nGlobal Positioning Satellite receiver (TrimbleTM AG122);\n(3) a laser rangefinder (MDL LaserAce 300); and (4) a\ndigital camera [Wilson et al., 2005]. Field data were\nrecorded in the form of 3-D shape files (containing xyz\nposition), using ArcPadTM (version 6), a mobile GIS soft-\nware suitable for running on Windows CE devices\nTC4018 WILSON ET AL.: TRANSTENSION AND SEGMENTATION IN LOFOTEN\n5 of 28\nTC4018\n[Edmondo, 2002]. Outcrop data (e.g., fault measurements\nand lithological data) were stored in point shape files, while\nlinear features in map view (e.g., fault trace, traverse line,\netc.) were recorded as polylines. These were supplemented\nby georeferenced outcrop photos and field sketches, both in\na digital format. Structures exposed in vertical outcrops (i.e.,\nroad cuts) were recorded using a combination of digital\nphotography and 3-D outcrop data capture using a laser\nranger (recording xyz point cloud data for outcrop surfaces\nand fault traces [Xu et al., 2000]).\n[21] Field mapping was concentrated on Lofoten\u2019s north-\nernmost island, Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya (Figure 2c). This was in part\nbecause of the dramatic topography and excellent exposure\non Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya.\n3.3. Offshore (\u2018\u2018Subsurface\u2019\u2019) Data Set\n[22] During the development of our regional structural\ndatabase a number of regional offshore fault maps were\ndigitized, including Mokhtari and Pegrum [1992], Blystad\net al. [1995], L\u00f8seth and Tveten [1996], Olesen et al. [1997,\n2002], and Tsikalas et al. [2001]. However, some incon-\nsistencies were found between these data sets (i.e., trends\nof faults, fault linkage, etc.) and consequently twenty-four\n2-D seismic lines (data coverage approximately 100 km \u0002\n75 km) were studied for an area west of the Lofoten Ridge\n(see Figure 6 in section 4.2.1 for location of survey area).\n[23] Seismic interpretation was carried out using Geo-\nFrame IESXTM before exporting fault and horizon data to\nTrapTesterTM to construct a 3-D structural model of the\narea. Five prominent reflectors were mapped, and have been\ncorrelated with the intra-Mesozoic, Base Cretaceous, intra-\nLower Cretaceous, Aptian and Albian horizons mapped by\nTsikalas et al. [2001] in the Ribban Basin. Larger faults\nhave been linked with some confidence based on mapped\nvariations in fault throw, and the resulting fault polygon\nmaps have been exported to GIS for comparison with\nonshore structures, while geometries have been analyzed\nin TrapTester.\n3.4. Building 3-D Models\n[24] The 3-D models provide a powerful tool for regional-\nscale structural investigations. Simple models for the Lofo-\nten Ridge were first constructed in ArcGIS, by overlaying\nLandsat images for the LVA region onto a DTM (Digital\nTerrain Model) of the area. These models can be viewed\nfrom different vantage points, zoomed to different scales,\nand simulated \u2018\u2018fly through\u2019\u2019 animations created. This is\nparticularly useful for studying the relationship between\nstructures and topography. Bedrock maps, gravity maps\nand magnetic maps were also draped onto the DTM for\nsimilar studies. These simple models have been described as\n\u2018\u20182.5-D\u2019\u2019 representations [Longley et al., 2001; Jones et al.,\n2004] as they do not provide any direct information about\nthe subsurface geology. For a fully 3-D model (i.e., equiv-\nalent to seismic models offshore) structures must be pro-\njected into and out of the topographic surface. For this type\nof analysis, more specific 3-D modeling software is required.\nFollowing structural interpretations in GoCADTM, regional\n3-D fault models were then reimported into ArcGIS\n(ArcScene) for integration with field GIS data and offshore\nfault and horizon models.\n4. Regional Structural Analysis\n4.1. Onshore Surface Analysis\n4.1.1. Lineament Populations\n[25] Along the Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen archipelago, good\nexposures in crystalline basement and the strong topographic\nrelief permit the ground truthing of lineaments that were\nmapped using Landsat TM data. The region appears highly\nfaulted and fractured, as indicated by the dense set of\n2000 lineaments identified from the remote sensed data\n[Gabrielsen et al., 2002; this study]. These regional linea-\nment maps show the Lofoten Ridge to have two dominant\nlineament trends, NNE-SSW (020\u0001\u2013040\u0001) and ENE-WSW\n(070\u0001\u2013090\u0001) (Figure 3), with subsidiary NW-SE, NE-SW,\nand E-W trends. Central Lofoten (i.e., Flakstad\u00f8ya and\nMoskenes\u00f8ya) and outer Vestera\u02dalen both show dominant\nN-S and NNE-SSW oriented lineament suites, while an\nENE-WSW trending lineament suite can be seen in north\nLofoten (Vestva\u02dag\u00f8ya and Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya) running east toward\nOfotfjorden (Figures 3a and 3b). Other systems include a\nNW-SE trending suite on Vestera\u02dalen (Figures 3a and 3b).\n4.1.2. Lineament Domains\n[26] Using ArcGIS, lineament density maps were made\nby counting the total number and total length of lineaments\nwithin a moving 1 km2 search window. These maps\nhighlight the dominant lineament in different parts of the\nLVA. Directional analysis was also carried out using rose\ndiagram plotting tools in ArcView. Having gridded the area\ninto 10 km \u0002 10 km cells, rose diagrams were plotted for\neach cell (Figure 3c). These spatial analyses reveal that the\nLVA can be subdivided into a series of distinct lineament\ndomains: (1) central Lofoten (CLD), (2) north Lofoten\n(NLD), (3) L\u00f8digen (L\u00f8dD), (4) Hinn\u00f8ya (HinD), and\n(5) Lang\u00f8ya (LangD); Figure 3d). In all 5 domains, a\ndominant lineament trend is NNE-SSW to NE-SW, with\nsome domains also showing a second dominant trend: ENE-\nWSW in north Lofoten, and NW-SE on Hinn\u00f8ya. These\ndomains are coincident with changes in ridge trend, and\nwith previously documented variations in regional gravity\nand magnetics (Figures 4b and 4c), but also denudation ages\nand offshore fault patterns [Tsikalas et al., 2001; Hendriks\nand Andriessen, 2002; Olesen et al., 2002]. Gravity highs\nappear to be associated with domains showing a single\npreferred lineament trend (i.e., central Lofoten and Lang\u00f8ya\ndomains [see Olesen et al., 2002, Figure 10]).\n4.1.3. Detailed Lineament Studies on Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya\n[27] Figure 4 shows a more detailed view of the multi-\nmodal lineament trends seen on Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya (north Lofo-\nten). In this area 4 main lineament systems have been\nidentified: approximately N-S (system 0); NNE-SSW to\nNE-SW (system 1); ENE-WSW to E-W (system 2); and\nESE-WNW to SE-NW (system 3).\n[28] System 0 lineaments (S0, Figure 4) are represented\nby deep, wide valleys and fjords, showing characteristics of\nclassic glacial U-shaped valleys. Compared to other sys-\ntems, this system has a relatively wide spacing (roughly\nTC4018 WILSON ET AL.: TRANSTENSION AND SEGMENTATION IN LOFOTEN\n6 of 28\nTC4018\nevery 3\u20135 km), and as a result there are fewer S0 linea-\nments to be observed. However, they do form the largest\nvalleys, and also appear to separate the largest islands (i.e.,\nFlakstad\u00f8ya, Vestva\u02dag\u00f8ya, Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya). Wide N-S valleys\n(S0) often appear bend, or be offset, in a counterclockwise\/\nleft lateral sense. This later deformation may suggest that S0\nlineaments are relatively old structures.\n[29] System 1 lineaments (S1, Figure 4) are the most\ncommon lineament trend along the ridge and are character-\nized by narrow, deeply incised valleys and fjords, such as\nRaftsundet (Figure 4c). System 2 lineaments (S2, Figure 4)\nhave a similar geomorphologic style to S1, i.e., represented\nby arrow, steep sided valleys such as the famous Trollfjord\n(Figure 4d). A distinct change in trend of S2 lineaments\n(from ENE-WSW to E-W) can be seen across Austvagoya\n(Figure 4). This change appears to roughly match a change\nin the trend of the overall ridge.\n[30] A strong correlation between the change in trend of\nS2 and the frequency and orientation of S1 lineaments is\nalso apparent. The density of S1 appears higher where S2\nlineaments trend E-W, and the mean orientation of S1\nlineaments in this same zone also appear to be\n\u000110\u0001Clockwise of S1 trends farther to the southwest\n(Figure 4). Crosscutting relationships observed between\nS1 and S2 lineaments appear to be quite complex, with\ngood examples of both S2 cutting S1 and vice versa. This\nmutual crosscutting relationship is likely to suggest that\nFigure 3. Regional lineament analysis of satellite data for the LVA.

These lineaments are represented by\nboth narrow and wide valleys. Crosscutting relationships\nsuggest that S3 lineaments are the youngest system as they\nappear to truncate most other trends, although caution must\nbe taken when interpreting age relationships from linea-\nments as it is often unclear if truncations represent linea-\nment terminations or true crosscutting older by younger.\n4.1.4. Regional Onshore Structural Model\n[32] The 3-D fault models have been created for these\nlineament maps in an attempt to construct onshore models\nequivalent to those produced from offshore seismic studies.\nThis was done using structural modeling tools in GoCADTM\nby overlaying Landsat lineament interpretations (in\nvector form) over a 50 m DTM; the lineaments then take\non a 2.5-D configuration (a curved line in 3-D space). If\nthere is sufficient interaction between topography and the\nlineament trace (the considerable topographic relief of\nLofoten is perfect for this), then best fit surfaces can be\nconstructed along each lineament, thus producing a repre-\nsentative fault plane (see Figure 5). Not only does this\nmethod provide a model to help visualize the 3-D structure\nof the region, but also allows the strike and dip of these\nregional fault surfaces to be calculated. These faults can\nthen be compared to the equivalent geometries interpreted\nfrom offshore seismic data and to field data (Figure 5).\n[33] The 3-D fault models were created using this\nmethod over a 25 km \u0002 50 km area of north Lofoten\n(Figures 4 and 5). Like the rest of the NLD, lineament\norientations in this area have two distinct preferred orienta-\ntions, \u0001035\u0001\u2013215\u0001 (S1) and \u0001080\u0001\u2013260\u0001 (S2). The result-\ning 3-D model for these structures displays a rhombic fault\nblock pattern (Figure 5), while the poles to planes of these\nregional structures appear to cluster in a bimodal distribu-\ntion (Figure 5f). Because of the lineament picking method\nfavoring straighter lines (i.e., the picker is nearly always\nbiased toward drawing straighter lines, particularly across\nareas of uncertainty, such as hillslopes in shadow or less\ndistinct lineament trace), the faults may appear steeper than\nthey really are (because a straighter line equates to a steeper\nstructure), which may account for the apparent clustering\naround the vertical dip.\n4.2. Offshore Subsurface Analysis\n4.2.1. Offshore Central Lofoten and the Havba\u02daen\nSubbasin\n[34] Offshore central Lofoten is characterized by a\nsingle major NNE-SSW to NE-SW trending border fault\n(parallel to the ridge trend) bounding a large depocenter\n(the Havba\u02daen subbasin; Figures 6a and 6b). Synrift thick-\nening of Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sequences is\napparent along the West Lofoten Border Fault (WLBF) in\nthis area, while most Middle Cretaceous sediment infilling\nthe Havba\u02daen subbasin appears to be associated with thermal\nsubsidence, thickening toward the center of the basin. Intra-\nLower Cretaceous and Middle Cretaceous hanging wall\nsequences dip away from the WLBF before shallowing to\nhorizontal through a hanging wall syncline (Figure 6a).\nOverlying strata can be seen to onlap these tilted horizons\n(see profile F, Figure 6b). This geometry resembles a similar\ncompaction-related geometry discussed by Thomson and\nUnderhill [1993] for faulting in the Moray Firth. These\nstructures are interpreted to form in response to differential\ncompaction as a consequence of varying hanging wall and\nfootwall lithologies together with a buttressing effect created\nby the underlying rigid footwall. Further synrift thickening\nof Upper Cretaceous sediments appear restricted to the\ndeepest part of the basin (see profile F, Figure 6a).\n4.2.2. Offshore North Lofoten\n[35] Offshore north Lofoten shows a number of contrast-\ning structures and styles compared those observed farther\nsouth. First, the throw on the WLBF appears to decrease\nmarkedly, which has resulted in a much shallower basin in\nthis area. Furthermore, the WLBF also shows a distinct\nchange in trend in this area, bending round into a NE-SW to\nENE-WSW orientation (Figures 6b and 6d). A number of\nNNE-SSW tending, west dipping normal faults (green faults\nin Figure 6) appear to bend round and join the WLBF\n(Figures 6b and 6d). These have been interpreted as a\nsystem of en echelon faults splaying off the border fault\nas it bends round in to an ENE-WSW trend. Alternatively\nthey may represent a system of breached relays. Either way,\nthese imply a component of sinistral oblique extension\nalong the WLBF in this area. These splay faults cut Late\nJurassic and Base Cretaceous strata. Also characteristic of\nthis area are a number of major NNE-SSW trending, east\ndipping faults located farther offshore (yellow faults in\nFigure 6). These show extensive synrift thickening of\nhanging wall sequences of Late Jurassic to Mid-Cretaceous\n(Aptian) age (Figure 6a). These faults lie along strike from\nthe prominent WLBF bounding the central Lofoten segment\nand likely take up much of the extension not seen along the\nborder fault as it is traced northward.\n[36] Throws on the WLBF and associated faults are\nreduced compared to those seen farther south, and more\nfaults can also be seen cutting lower Cretaceous strata. This\nmay suggest that deformation is less focused along the\nbounding fault in north Lofoten and that strain is more\ndistributed across the basin. Further to this observation is\nthe fact that there is no significant depocenter in this\narea compared to central Lofoten and there is also signif-\nicantly less evidence for thermal subsidence and infilling\n(Figures 6a and 6b). In the northern part of this area,\nFigure 4. (a) Detailed lineament studies of north Lofoten. Lineaments are colored according to fault\/lineament system\n(S0\u2013S3).

This is likely to have occurred at the same time as\nthe sediments that covered Vestera\u02dalen were eroded away\n[Dalland, 1981; L\u00f8seth and Tveten, 1996].\n[37] A NNW-SSE trending transfer zone (Jannegga trans-\nfer zone [Tsikalas et al., 2001]) has previously been mapped\nthrough the area between these two domains. However, it\nshould be noted that no distinct structures marking the\nposition of this transfer zone can be seen in seismic data\n(see Figure 6a), and thus this zone simply marks the\ntransition between domains of differing fault polarity and\nbasin location.\n5. Field Data Analysis\n5.1. Outcrop Exposures Around Raftsundet\n[38] Field reconnaissance mapping in north Lofoten\n(Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya and Vestva\u02dag\u00f8ya) has confirmed that most\nlineaments correspond to major fault structures (Figures 4c\nand 4d). In some cases the structures themselves cannot be\ndirectly identified as they lie at the bottom of fjords or\nvegetated valleys (e.g., Raftsundet; see Figures 4c and 7a).\nHowever, the intensity of fracturing in adjacent areas of\nexposed rock is consistent with their location close to major\nfault structures. Almost all exposures in the mapping area\nwere in charnockites (orthopyroxene granite) and manger-\nites (orthopyroxene monzanite) of the Raftsund Pluton\n(colored pink in Figure 4b). These rocks exhibit a weak\nE-W trending fabric; however, in many places, basement\nfabrics were indiscernible. The freshest exposures of fault\nsurfaces were found on road cut sections and shorelines;\nhowever, because of the dramatic topography of the area,\nmany faults and fault zones can also be easily traced up\nmountainsides (Figure 7b). Fault exposures varied from\nlarge solitary faults in a relatively undeformed country\nrock (Figure 7c) to fault zones of highly fractured rock\n(Figures 7d and 7h). Fault rocks observed were generally\nsemibrittle (slickenlines) to brittle (cataclasite) (Figures 7d\nand 7e), and little evidence for fluid interaction during\ndeformation was observed (the only example of minerali-\nzation was found at a locality in the hanging wall of the\nIngelsfjorden fault, in the form of epidotic slickenfibers).\n5.2. Fault Populations\n[39] During fieldwork, 666 mesoscale (centimeter-\ndecimeter scale exposures) faults and fractures and associ-\nated slip striae have been measured at over 20 localities\nacross NE Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya. More than 60% of the faults\nmeasured exhibit good kinematic indicators, in the form\nof slickenlines and striated coatings (Figure 7e). Kinematic\nindicators such as Riedel shears were used to infer shear\ndirection and shear sense on each fault plane [Petit, 1987].\n5.2.1. Steep Brittle Faults\n[40] When plotted stereographically, three main brittle\nfault clusters are apparent (Figure 8a, left), with strike\norientations that closely match the data derived from line-\nament analysis (Figure 5f). These clusters reflect 2 distinct\nfault geometries: (1) NNE-SSW to NE-SW trending faults,\ndipping NW and SE (system 1\/S1; Figure 8b) and (2) ENE-\nWSW to E-W trending faults dipping mainly to the north\n(system 2\/S2; Figures 7b and 8c). These fault geometries are\nmatched by similar fracture\/joint trends (i.e., surfaces with\nno clear evidence for shear; Figure 8a, right). Only ENE-\nWSW and E-W trending surfaces showed plumose mark-\nings characteristic of joints (Figure 7g), and these were\nfound in the vicinity of an E-W trending lamprophyre dike\nat locality LO3 (the margins of which have been reactivated\nby sinistral strike-slip movements; Figures 9a and 10). A\nsecond lamprophyre dike trending NNE-SSW was also\nobserved at Locality LO2 (Figure 9b), in this case the dike\nwas highly deformed and reactivated by both dip-slip and\ndextral oblique-slip faults. Plots of slip striae (Figure 8a,\nmiddle) show that all fault orientations are dominated by\ndip-slip (i.e., slickenline pitch >60\u0001) or oblique-slip (pitch\n30\u0001\u201360\u0001) normal fault movements. However, a small num-\nber of strike-slip (pitch <30\u0001) movements were also ob-\nserved, and some faults also exhibit multiple slip striae.\nStrike-slip striae on system 1 (NNE-SSW oriented) faults\nindicate a dextral shear sense; while on system 2 (ENE-\nWSW oriented) faults show sinistral shear, and may repre-\nsent a conjugate pair (Figure 8d).\n[41] A spatial analysis of fault geometry and slickenline\ndata was carried out in ArcView using an interactive GIS\nstereoplot program provided by Knox-Robinson and Gardoll\n[1998]. Figure 10 shows a summary map, and associated\nstereonets, for fault populations for localities in the area of\nRaftsundet. No distinct patterns of spatial distribution are\napparent across the mapping area; however, it may be noted\nthat fault geometries at outcrop generally reflect local line-\nament trends. At a number of localities, there also appears to\nbe a strong correlation between the dominant slickenlines\norientation and the mean fault intersection (Figure 10).\n5.2.2. Low-Angle Normal Faults\n[42] A number of low-angle (<45\u0001 dip) normal faults can\nbe found in the vicinity of Raftsundet (e.g., localities LO9,\n10 and 11; Figure 10). These generally dip to the west and\nnorthwest and have a listric geometry. These faults are\ncharacterized by a deformation zone (50\u2013200 cm thick)\nof ductile (mylonitic) to semibrittle fault rocks (Figure 7f).\nSimilar structures have been described by Heier [1960] and\nL\u00f8seth and Tveten [1996] on Hinn\u00f8ya and Lang\u00f8ya to the\nFigure 5.

These faults are important as they appear to be locally\nreactivated by later brittle faults described above (Figure 7).\n5.3. Age Relationships\n[43] Both crosscutting fault relationships and overprint-\ning slickenline have been analyzed in an attempt to deter-\nmine a temporal succession of fault movements. Ayounging\ntable (Table 1) was constructed using methodology of Potts\nand Reddy, [1999] in order to determine the relative age\nrelationships of each fault set based on the field observa-\ntions (e.g., crosscutting relationships and overprinting fault\nstriae; Figure 7f). For the interpretation of age relationships\nfaults have been categorized into six distinct systems based\non orientation and slip: NNE-SSW (normal); NNE-SSW\n(strike slip); ENE-WSW (dip slip); ENE-WSW (strike slip);\nNE-SW (oblique slip); low-angle normal faults.\n[44] Only a few conclusive and consistent crosscutting\nrelationships between faults can be identified. Low-angle\nnormal faults are clearly the oldest faults observed, with\nNNE trending (S1) faults appearing to be next, followed by\nENE-WSW (S2) and NE-SW. However, the relationship\nbetween S1 and S2 faults appears far more complex with\nexamples of S1 faults crosscutting S2 faults, and vice versa,\nbeing seen within any one exposure. This mutual crosscut-\nting relationship therefore likely suggests that these fault\nsystems developed at a similar time or at least were active\nduring the same tectonic event. It should be noted that\nstrike-slip striae appear to postdate dip-slip striae on most\nNNE-SSW trending (S1) fault surfaces; however, the rela-\ntionship between dip-slip and strike-slip movements on\nS2 faults is more unclear. In many cases, multiple slicken-\nlines on a single fault surface can be attributed to fault\ninteraction rather than reactivation (see Figures 9c and 9d\nand section 5.5).\n5.4. Kinematic Analysis\n[45] Kinematic analysis was carried out using so-called\n\u2018\u2018paleostress analysis\u2019\u2019 techniques. The analysis of fault slip\ndata yields information concerning the orientation of the\nstrain tensor, and thus the calculated axes are referred to\nusing infinitesimal\/finite strain nomenclature rather than\nprinciple stresses. The aims of our study here were (1) to\ndetermine if all fault movements are compatible with a\nsingle strain field and (2) to derive a \u2018\u2018paleostress\u2019\u2019 tensor\nfrom the outcrop data that can be compared to kinematics\ninferred from regional fault patterns developed onshore and\noffshore. Kinematic inversion techniques have been exten-\nsively used by various workers for nearly 40 years (see\nAngelier [1994] and Ramsay and Lisle [2000] for an\nexhaustive review). The assumptions and methods of paleo-\nstress have been discussed in detail in many other papers\n[Etchecopar et al., 1981; Angelier, 1984, 1994; Michael,\n1984; Reches, 1987; Delvaux and Sperner, 2003] and are\nnot discussed here. It should be noted, however, that this\napproach is reasonable only in regions where there is little\nmisorientation between finite and infinitesimal strain axis\n(i.e., in areas where finite noncoaxial strain is low).\n5.4.1. Inversion Procedures\n[46] In total, 414 faults with good kinematic indicators\nwere recorded (Figure 8a), which can be used for kinematic\ninversion. My FaultTM stereonet software, produced by\nPangaea Scientific Ltd., was used for kinematic analysis.\n[47] Two separate procedures for sorting the fault data\ninto populations for inversion analysis have been applied\nduring the present study. The first (procedure 1) simply uses\nthe entire unsorted data set (i.e., all 414 fault and fault\nstriae) while the second (procedure 2) required manual\nsorting and separate analysis of the data into fault systems.\n[48] In procedure 1, after input of the raw data, data files\nwere corrected to ensure that all striae lie perfectly on their\nrespective fault planes (i.e., no angular mismatch). To do\nthis, fault striae were rotated along the common plane\ncontaining the striae and the pole of the fault plane.\nFollowing this, the bulk fault population data set was\ninverted. Those faults with high misfit angles (>40\u0001) relative\nto the inversion result were then rejected and the inversion\nrerun. This procedure was repeated until a single group of\nfaults with a homogeneous solution could be found. The\nrejected data were then rerun through the program in an\nattempt to derive multiple paleostress vectors. A similar\niterative approach has been applied by Titus et al. [2002].\nThis procedure was then repeated for various inversion\nmethods [i.e., Angelier, 1984; Michael, 1984; Reches,\n1987] to test the consistency of the results.\n[49] In procedure 2, a potential risk when analyzing a\nbulk fault population data set with uncertain age relation-\nships is that the kinematic data being analyzed represent\nmore than one phase of movement. This can result in the\nderived vectors reflecting a combination of the two or more\nphases and may not be geologically meaningful [Delvaux\nand Sperner, 2003]. Fault data were separated according to\nfault geometry (i.e., fault systems 1 and 2; Figures 8b and\n8c), and any examples of structures associated with fault\ninteraction were disregarded as this violates the basic\nassumptions of inversion methods [Nieto-Samaniego and\nFigure 6. (a) A series of interpreted seismic profiles, trending NW-SE, across the Ribban Basin. Profiles highlight\nchanges in basin geometry and fault style between central Lofoten and north Lofoten.

Figure 6b is a base Cretaceous horizon map showing a large depocenter (the Havba\u02daen\nsubbasin) offshore central Lofoten, and no basin apparent in north Lofoten. Figure 6c shows a fault model showing distinct\nchange in geometry from south to north Lofoten (red, WLBF; green, splaying faults; yellow, low-angle east dipping faults;\nblue, other minor faults). Also shown are onshore lineament domains (colored polygons) and NNW-SSE trending transfer\nzones (red planes).

As the data have already been sorted\nprior to analysis, the \u2018\u2018iterative\u2019\u2019 sorting approach, used\nduring procedure 1, was only required for the strike-slip\nfault set.\n5.4.2. Inversion Results\n[50] Bulk inversion of all fault data (procedure 1) using\nthe inversion method of Michael [1984] produced a sub-\nhorizontal maximum infinitesimal extension strain axis\n(xi \u0003 s3) of 316\/03, and subvertical minimum infinitesimal\nextension (or shortening) strain axis (zi \u0003 s1) of 170\/86, and\nthus suggests that maximum horizontal extension (Ehmax)\nwas oriented NW-SE (Figure 11a). Similarly oriented axis\nwere calculated using all other inversion methods [e.g.,\nAngelier, 1984; Reches, 1987].\n[51] Following procedure 2, three separate sets of paleo-\nstress axes can be derived, one for each fault system\nanalyzed (i.e., system 1 dip-slip, system 2 dip-slip, and all\nstrike-slip faults; Figures 8b\u20138d). Analysis of each fault\nsystem yield similarly oriented axes (of course, for strike-\nslip faults the yi and zi axes are switched; i.e., Z is\nhorizontal); although there is a 12\u0001 variation in the azimuth\nof the extensional axes (xi) (Figure 11b). These results are\nall consistent with a NW-SE maximum horizontal extension\n(Ehmax), which is roughly 60\u0001 to the trend of the north\nLofoten Ridge (i.e., in mapping area ridge trends approxi-\nmately E-W).\n5.5. Fault Interaction: Implications for Stress Inversion\n[52] In recent years, a number of studies have examined\nthe limitations of inversion methods [Pollard et al., 1993;\nCashman and Ellis, 1994; Nieto-Samaniego and Alaniz-\nAlvarez, 1997; Maerten, 2000]. Slickenlines are kinematic\nindicators (slip vectors), and when these are used to inter-\npret the regional stress field a number of assumptions have\nto be made. One of the most important assumptions is that\nthe slickenlines are produced by the general stress tensor,\nimplying that faults do not interact and that the stress field is\nnot significantly perturbed after fault slip. Pollard et al.\n[1993] discuss how interaction between preexisting planes\ncan lead to stress field perturbations of up to 40\u0001 in\norientation when the density of fault planes is high. Inter-\nacting fault movements on preexisting planes can lead to\nmultiple slickenline sets forming under a single regional\nstress field [e.g., Cashman and Ellis, 1994].\n[53] In some areas of north Lofoten there is strong\nevidence to suggest that fault interaction has played a\nsignificant role in the development of faults. As there are\nmultiple fault orientations, and the spacing between faults is\nsmall (generally <2 m) some interaction between structures\nis likely. The mean slickenline orientations at many out-\ncrops appear to coincide with the mean intersection between\nfaults (e.g., Figure 10), which is consistent with the inter-\nacting block model of Nieto-Samaniego and Alaniz-Alvarez\n[1997]. Several examples of exactly this type of fault\ninteraction have been recognized at outcrop (e.g., Figure\n9c). Another example of interaction between faults is shown\nin Figure 9d. Here we see a continuous set of slickenlines\nthat can be traced round a 90\u0001 bend, from an approximately\nN-S trending fault plane to one trending approximately E-\nW. The intersection between these planes appears well\nrounded, thus suggesting shear along these planes was\ndirectly linked. Fault movements suggest a counterclock-\nwise rotation about a subvertical axis (note fault intersection\nplunges steeply toward the NE; Figure 9d), and are consis-\ntent with NW-SE extension with potentially a component\nwrench simple shear.\n[54] Nieto-Samaniego and Alaniz-Alvarez [1997] have\nsuggested that fault systems controlled by fault block\ninteraction may not be suitable for paleostress analysis as\na number of basic assumptions of these methods are\nviolated. However, given the large number of data collected\nin the present study and the seeming consistency of the\npaleostress analysis results, we feel that in this case, a valid\nresult has been obtained. One reason for this is that using a\nGIS for data management allowed efficient, quantitative\nfiltering of all data points that do not meet certain geospatial\nor geological criteria. For example, all faults showing\noutcrop evidence for \u2018\u2018fault interaction\u2019\u2019 were removed from\nthe analysis.\n[55] Furthermore, detailed analysis of fault movements\nassociated with these examples of fault interaction indicate\nthat kinematics appear consistent with stress axis interpreted\nusing paleostress analysis described above (Figure 9).\n6. Discussion\n6.1. Structural Variations Along the Lofoten Ridges\n6.1.1. Variations Between Onshore and Offshore\nStructures\n[56] Detailed onshore lineament studies have revealed\nthat the LVA can be divided into a series of distinct\nlineament domains (Figure 3). These variations are coinci-\nFigure 7. Photographs showing regional to outcrop-scale structures seen in Lofoten.

This is likely to be due to the onshore\nand offshore study areas being located on slightly different\nparts of the ridge (i.e., offshore data is from west of\nVestva\u02dag\u00f8ya and southern Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya, where as onshore\ndata is from northern Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya) and thus slightly different\nridge trends (approximately ENE-WSW and approximately\nE-W, respectively). A further explanation may also be that\nonshore we are looking at deformation within basement\nrocks in the footwall to the border fault; while offshore it\nis deformation is within cover rocks of the hanging wall.\nHowever, onshore lineament trends on Vestva\u02dag\u00f8ya appear\nsimilar to those offshore; therefore the former explanation\nappears more likely.\n6.1.2. Regional Versus Field Measurements of\nOnshore Faults\n[58] Regional fault models derived from lineament\nanalysis for the NLD show a rhombic fault block pattern\n(Figure 5), with the poles to planes of these regional faults\nclustering in a bimodal distribution (i.e., near vertical dips;\nFigure 5f). However, field observations suggest that many\nof these regional faults have a shallower dip than those\nsuggested by our 3-D model. For example, Figure 7b shows\n3 large fault traces identified in the field which dip at \u000160\u2013\n65\u0001 north. These faults were also recognized from linea-\nments on the Landsat image and in the GoCADTM model;\nhowever, these planes appear to dip at >80\u0001. Therefore it\nwould appear that a limitation of this method of fitting best\nfit planes through lineament traces can lead to an over-\nsteepening of the fault plane by \u000110\u201315\u0001. Hence any\nregional fault dipping at >75 is likely to appear near vertical\nin this model. Consequently, we interpret the derived\nlineament data as masking a multimodal fracture distribu-\ntion which we relate to 3-D deformation, rather than 2-D\nplane strain (see below and Oertel [1965], Reches [1978],\nand Krantz [1989]).\n6.2. Oblique Extension and Transtension in\nNorth Lofoten\n6.2.1. Multimodal Faulting in North Lofoten:\nPolyphase Deformation or 3-D Strain?\n[59] Rift systems that undergo extension oblique to the\nbasin bounding faults commonly show complex multimodal\nfault patterns [e.g., Withjack and Jamison, 1986; Clifton et\nal., 2000; Dewey, 2002; De Paola et al., 2005a, 2005b]. As\nthe extension directions calculated in north Lofoten appear\nmoderately oblique to the trend of the ridge, it is likely that\nFigure 11. Kinematic inversion analysis.

All results suggest a NW-SE maximum horizontal extension (i.e., Ehmax range from\n318\u0001 to 330\u0001).\nTC4018 WILSON ET AL.: TRANSTENSION AND SEGMENTATION IN LOFOTEN\n19 of 28\nTC4018\nthis area has undergone transtensional deformation. Both\nregional and outcrop studies in north Lofoten have revealed\nan apparent multimodal fault geometry, i.e., fault patterns\ndominated by more than two distinct fault sets (Figure 8a).\nMultiple fault orientations are common in many geological\nsettings [e.g., Krantz, 1988, 1989; Nieto-Samaniego and\nAlaniz-Alvarez, 1997; Sagy et al., 2003]. Nieto-Samaniego\nand Alaniz-Alvarez [1997] proposed four main mechanisms\nto develop such multimodal fault patterns are (1) polyphase\ndeformation (i.e., two or more sets of faults, developed due\nto two or more deformation events, assuming Andersonian\nfault models); (2) reactivation of noninteracting faults\naccording to the Bott [1959] model; (3) faulting associated\nwith 3-D strain (e.g., orthorhombic faulting [Reches, 1978;\nKrantz, 1989]); and (4) interacting block model [Nieto-\nSamaniego and Alaniz-Alvarez, 1997]. As transtensional\ndeformation is a combination of extension and strike-slip\ndeformation [Sanderson and Marchini, 1984; Dewey,\n2002], fault patterns associated with 3-D strain are also\nlikely to develop [Reches, 1978; De Paola et al., 2005a].\nTherefore, during a bulk homogeneous transtensional de-\nformation, case 3 seems to be the most likely kinematic\nsolution which will govern the development of faulting\npatterns under infinitesimal strain fields. As finite strains\naccumulate, however, case 2 and particularly case 4 could\nincreasingly become important [Nieto-Samaniego and\nAlaniz-Alvarez, 1997; De Paola, 2005]. This appears to be\nthe case in north Lofoten where we see a regional set of\nmultimodal faults not dissimilar to orthorhombic patterns of\nReches [1978], with strong evidence for fault interaction in\nareas of highest fracture density (i.e., near major faults such\nas the Raftsundet Fault).\n[60] An alternative model to transtension in north Lofoten\nis that each fault system developed independently (i.e., as\nsuggested by S. G. Berge et al. (The Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen\ncontinental margin: A multiphase Mesozoic-Palaeogene\nrifted shelf as shown by offshore-onshore brittle fracture\nanalysis, submitted to Norwegian Journal of Geology, 2006,\nhereinafter referred to as Berge et al., submitted manuscript,\n2006) during slightly different regional stress. Although\nsome degree of polyphase deformation is apparent from\nobservations made in this study (i.e., multiple slikenlines\nand crosscutting relationships), mutual crosscutting relation-\nships between S1 and S2 faults suggest they are likely to be\ncontemporaneous. Thus we suggest that much of the appar-\nent polyphase deformation seen in Lofoten is the result of\nfault interaction and localized variations in stress during a\nprolonged phase of deformation. This model is also favored\nby the fact that kinematic indicators on almost all faults\ncorrespond to a similar NW-SE extension. However, with-\nout better age constraints for individual fault movements,\ndistinguishing which of these contrasting models is more\nlikely is somewhat difficult.\n6.2.2. Corrections Because of Oblique Extension\n[61] Up to this point we have been discussing NW-SE\nextension axes based on observations in north Lofoten.\nHowever, in section 6.2.1 we suggest that the fault patterns\nin is area likely developed in transtension, and that maxi-\nmum horizontal extension is oblique to the trend of the\nridge. Withjack and Jamison [1986] show that during\noblique rifting the orientation of maximum horizontal\nextension strain (Ehmax) is controlled by a, the angle\nbetween the rift trend and the direction of displacement.\nThis is defined by the relationship between the angles a and\nFigure 12. (a) Simplified box model summarizing rela-\ntionship between a and bx and the relative to the\ndeformation boundary. (b) Cartoon diagram summarizing\ncorrections due to obliquity between Ehmax and local ridge\ntrend in order to estimate true regional extension (i.e., use\nequation (1) to calculate a (angle between regional\nextension vector and trend of ridge) from bx (angle between\nEhmax and trend of ridge). (c) An a versus bx plot\ncorresponding to solution of equation (1) [from De Paola\net al., 2005a]. Points 1 and 2 correspond to a and bx angles\nfor north Lofoten Ridge segments shown in Figure 12b.\nResults suggest fault patterns developed under oblique\nWNW-ESE extension.\nTC4018 WILSON ET AL.: TRANSTENSION AND SEGMENTATION IN LOFOTEN\n20 of 28\nTC4018\nb, which correspond to the acute angles of the regional\nextension vector, and the maximum horizontal extension\nstrain (Ehmax), respectively, measured relative to the defor-\nmation zone boundary (Figure 12a) according to (shown\ngraphically in Figure 12c)\nbx \u00bc 90\u0005 \u0006 0:5 tan\u00061 cot a\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01\u00de\nwhich may be rewritten more simply as [McCoss, 1986]\n90\u0005 \u0006 bx \u00bc 1=2 90\u0005 \u0006 a\u00f0 \u00de \u00f02\u00de\nIn north Lofoten, Ehmax (330\u0001\u2013150\u0001) inferred from linea-\nment trends, and calculated from paleostress inversion,\nappears to be moderately oblique (bx \t 60\u0001) to the trend\nof the ridge (trend 090\u0001\u2013270\u0001). By applying equation (1),\nwe see that this bx angle corresponds to an a value of 30\u0001,\nand thus implies a regional extension closer to WNW-ESE\n(300\u0001; Figure 12b and Table 2).\n6.2.3. Orthogonal and Oblique Ridge Segments\n[62] Ridge segment orientations relative to the direction\nof plate motion appear to play a critical role in determining\nthe structural architecture of a particular ridge segment [see\nalso Taylor et al., 1994; Clifton and Schlische, 2003].\nOnshore, variations in the dominant lineament\/fracture\ntrends along the Lofoten Ridge can be explained using a\nmodel for oblique extension\/transtension along the LVA that\ndevelops due to the changing trend of the deforming zone\nboundary structures (i.e., border faults to the ridge) with\nrespect to the regional extension vector (Figure 13). In this\nmodel there are three distinct deformation zones. In central\nLofoten, there is a zone of orthogonal extension (a = 90\u0001)\n(zone A), passing northward into two zones of transtension\n(B and C). Zone B corresponds to an angle a of\u000145\u0001, which\nis close to the transition between extension-dominated and\nwrench-dominated transtension (shown as 20\u0001 in Figure 1,\nbut it generally ranges from 30\u0001 to 40\u0001 for most rocks,\nFigure 12c; see De Paola et al. [2005a]) while zone C lies\njust within the wrench-dominated field (horizontal z axis)\nwith an a value of 30\u0001 (Figure 13).\n[63] The model for increasingly oblique transtension\nnorthward along the Lofoten Ridge is also consistent with\noffshore structural changes. Each zone is predicted to\nexhibit different faulting patterns and degrees of vertical\nshortening. In zone A, the shortening axis is vertical\npredicting a significant amount of vertical thinning and\nrift-related subsidence. In zones B and C smaller amounts\nof vertical thinning and rift-related subsidence are predicted.\nOur observations offshore suggest that in the central Lofo-\nten domain the WLBF has a large throw, with a deep\nsedimentary basin developed in its hanging wall. Along\nstrike in the region offshore from the NLD, the fault throws\nare reduced and the basins are markedly shallower or even\nabsent.\n[64] In our model, the boundaries between each domain\nmay have started off trending roughly N-S (perhaps\ncontrolled by preexisting Permian extensional structures\n(Figure 14) [Steltenpohl et al., 2004]) and highly oblique\nto the regional extension. As extension continued these\nboundaries are likely to have rotated counterclockwise to\nlie parallel to the NNW-SSE trending transfer zones\ninferred by Tsikalas et al. [2001] (Figures 2 and 13).\n6.2.4. Comparisons With Experimental Models and\nOther Field Analogues\n[65] Experimental clay models for oblique rifting show\nthat fault orientation will change with respect to the angle\nof obliquity, a (Figure 13c and Table 2) [Withjack and\nJamison, 1986; Clifton et al., 2000]. The fracture patterns\npredicted by these models show similar trends to those\nobserved in lineament patterns for each domain along the\nLofoten Ridge (Figure 3 and 13a). Significantly, the com-\nplex multimodal fault patterns and orientation of faults\nrelative to the ridge bounding fault seen in north Lofoten\n(i.e., Austva\u02dag\u00f8ya and Vestva\u02dag\u00f8ya) resemble models for\n20\u0001\u201330\u0001 oblique divergence (Figure 13c) [Withjack and\nJamison, 1986; Clifton et al., 2000]. This model for oblique\nextension also appears valid for offshore fault patterns\nwhich show an en echelon style set of faults splaying off\nthe WLBF, and suggest a component of sinistral shear along\nthe border fault (note that this may also explain the\nsignificant decrease in throw along the WLBF in this area).\nThe kinematic inversion analysis of outcrop-scale faults\nwithin north Lofoten suggests a NW-SE extension. If we\nuse the ridge trend in this domain (approximately E-W) to\ndefine regional-scale orientation of the deformation zone\nboundary faults, then b = 60\u0001For the NLD. By applying\nequation (1), we obtain an angle a = 30\u0001, and a regional\nextension vector (RE) oriented 300\u0001 (for exact values see\nFigure 12 and Table 2). Importantly, this WNW-ESE\nTable 2.

In this example multimodal\nfault patterns are again apparent, with a combination of\nboth strike-slip and dip-slip fault kinematics [Clifton and\nSchlische, 2003]. Recent studies have shown that these faults\ndeveloped under a variable stress history, with alternating\nphases of extension-dominated and wrench-dominated\ndeformation, over short geological timescales (i.e., less\nthan 1000 years) [Kattenhorn and Clifton, 2005]. These\nFigure 13. (a) Summary map showing variations in fault patterns and structural style along the Lofoten\nRidge. A, B, C refer to deformation zones described in Table 2.

A similar explana-\ntion may be applicable for the complex crosscutting relation-\nships and overprinting of strike-slip and dip-slip slickenlines\nseen in the Lofoten as a relatively young Lamprhopyre dike\n(compared to those described by Griffin et al. [1978]) was\nseen trending parallel to (084\/82S), and reactivated by,\nsystem 2 faults (Figure 9a). A prominent set of tensile\nfractures\/joints, were also seen trending parallel to this dike\n(Figure 7e). A second more highly deformed dike was also\nseen trending parallel to S1 faults (Figure 9b). The age of\nthese dikes is unknown, but we suggest that they may have\nbeen emplaced synchronous with extensional faults and joint\nformation in these basement rocks (i.e., similar to the model\nof Kattenhorn and Clifton [2005]). However, as this model is\nbased on the observation of just two Lamprophyre dikes,\nfurther field research is required.\n[67] A further similarity between the observations made\nin this study and those described from the Reykjanes Ridge\nis the occurrence of complex fault interaction, particularly at\nthe \u2018\u2018inside corners\u2019\u2019 of fault\/ridge segments [Clifton et al.,\n2005]. As shown in Figure 9c, d a number of good\nexamples of fault interaction have been observed in this\nstudy, all of which were found at the inside (i.e., footwall)\ncorner between the intersecting Raftsundet and Ingelsfjor-\nden Faults (i.e., localities LO6, LO8, and LO9; Figure 10).\n6.3. Margin Segmentation and Evolution\n6.3.1. Ridge Development and Fault Evolution\n[68] A number of different fault\/fracture trends have been\nidentified from lineament studies (S0\u2013S3; Figures 3 and 4).\nHowever, only two of these trends are accounted for in our\nmodel for oblique extension during the Late Jurassic and\nEarly Cretaceous (i.e., S1 and S2). Age relationships\ninterpreted from apparent crosscutting relationships identi-\nfied during remote sensing and visualization of 2.5-D and\n3-D models suggested that S0 lineaments are likely to be\nolder and S3 lineaments younger, than S1\/S2 structures. We\ntherefore tentatively suggest a model for the development of\nthese structures as follows: the progressive development\nof S0 faults\/fractures during E-W extension, followed by\nS1\/S2 faults developing during WNW-ESE oblique exten-\nsion, and finally S3 strike-slip faults during NW-SE exten-\nsion (Figure 14). Consistent with observations made by\nLundin and Dore\u00b4 [1997] and Olesen et al. [1997] there is\nlikely to have been a westward shift in deformation with\ntime from the east Lofoten and the Vestafjorden-Vana fault\ncomplex during the Permian, through to offshore west\nLofoten in the Cretaceous (Figure 14). This model is similar\nto the multistage model proposed by Berge et al. (submitted\nmanuscript, 2006), the only exception being in our model\nS1 and S2 faults are active contemporaneously due to\noblique extension. This suggested evolution is consistent\nwith plate reconstructions of the Norwegian-Greenland\nmargins which show E-W extension during Permian to\nJurassic times, rotating progressively through WNW-ESE\nduring Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, to NW-SE exten-\nsion during Late Cretaceous and Paleogene, and ending\nwith NW-SE seafloor spreading in the Eocene [Dore\u00b4 et al.,\n1999; Mosar et al., 2002].\n6.3.2. Segmentation of the LVA: Transfer Zones and\nSegment Boundaries\n[69] Most maps of both the Norwegian and Lofoten-\nVesteralen margins show that they are segmented by a\nseries of NW-SE transfer zones [Lundin and Dore\u00b4, 1997;\nFigure 14. Possible model for the structural evolution of the Lofoten Ridge from Permian through to\nEocene. Main structures discussed in this study correspond to Late Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous extension.\nTC4018 WILSON ET AL.: TRANSTENSION AND SEGMENTATION IN LOFOTEN\n23 of 28\nTC4018\nOlesen et al., 1997, 2002; Brekke, 2000; Tsikalas et al.,\n2001]. This inferred segmentation of the Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen\nregion is based on changes in fault polarity and sediment\nthickness offshore, and crustal structure (derived from\npotential field data) onshore [Olesen et al., 1997, 2002;\nTsikalas et al., 2001]. Hendriks and Andriessen [2002] have\nalso shown that separate ridge segments appear to show\ndifferent denudation histories. A number of rift segments\nand transfer zones have been proposed (see Figure 2), but\nthere are disagreements concerning the exact position\nand orientation of these structures [e.g., Tsikalas et al.,\n2001; Olesen et al., 2002]. A key reason for this indecision\non the location of these structures is the fact that no\ndistinct lineaments representing these transfer zones can\nbe identified.\n[70] The Bivrost, Vestera\u02dalen and Senja transfer zones\nhave been attributed to the influence of deep seated base-\nment structures at depth [Olesen et al., 2002; Mjelde et al.,\n2003]. Known examples of such structures may include the\nBothnian-Kv\u00e6nangen and the Bothnian-Senja fault com-\nplexes (Figure 2). It is somewhat difficult, however, to link\nother transfer zones on the LVA (e.g., the Mosken, Jennegga\ntransfer zones) to such basement shear zones. Instead, these\ntransfer zone boundaries appear be zones of \u2018\u2018soft linkage\u2019\u2019\n(or accommodation zones [Peacock et al., 2000]) between\nmargin segments characterized by different basin and fault\ngeometries. Furthermore, the structure of these differing\nmargin segments appears to correspond to variations in the\ndivergence angle between the ridge (or margin) bounding\nfaults and the regional extension vector (Figure 13). Similar\nobservations have also been made along the Brazilian\nmargin of the South Atlantic [Davison, 1997] where the\nwidth of the margin may also be linked to obliquity.\n6.3.3. Origins of Oblique Ridge Segments\n[71] As our model for margin segmentation is based on\nthe influence of oblique margin segments, we must there-\nfore assess the origins of margin obliquity. Oblique exten-\nsion is generally associated with the reactivation or control\nof preexisting structures [Holdsworth et al., 1997]. No\ndistinct fabrics (e.g., shear zones, strong foliation, etc.)\nFigure 15. Possible controls on the development of\nthe obliquely trending north Lofoten Ridge segment.\n(a) Reactivation of \u2018\u2018spoon-shaped\u2019\u2019 Devonian detachment\nfaults that may have controlled the trend of the northern part\nof the Lofoten Ridge [Olesen et al., 2002]. However, only\nlocalized reactivation of Devonian low-angle faults has been\nobserved in this study. (b) Differential uplift of fault blocks\nfrom Permian to Cretaceous that may effect the development\nof fault trends in neighboring blocks (i.e., older fault blocks\nin result in outer Vestera\u02dalen Block, block 1, may have acted\nas a barrier to later faults developing during the uplift of the\nmain Lofoten Ridge, blocks 2, 3, and 4). Denudation ages\nfrom AFT studies by Hendriks [2003]. (c) A basement\nbuoyancy effect caused by the AMCG suite (anorthosite-\nmangerite-charnockite-granite) underlying much of North\nLofoten that may have led to the preferential uplift of an\noblique trending ridge block, i.e., similar to effect of granites\nunder Mid-North Sea High [Donato et al., 1983].\nTC4018 WILSON ET AL.: TRANSTENSION AND SEGMENTATION IN LOFOTEN\n24 of 28\nTC4018\nwere observed within the basement rocks studied that could\ndirectly account for the oblique trend of the north Lofoten\nRidge. A few discreet E-W trending joints and dikes were\nrecorded that appear to be reactivated by faults at outcrop;\nhowever, the age of these is unclear (i.e., they may be\nsynchronous with faulting), and they are not intense enough\nto account for the overall change in ridge trend. Figure 15\nshows three possible origins for this obliquity; however,\nresearch is required to investigate these further.\n[72] Olesen et al. [2002] proposed a model in which the\nborder faults to the north Lofoten Ridge reactivate \u2018\u2018spoon-\nshaped\u2019\u2019 Devonian detachments (Figure 15a; also see\nFigure 16 of Olesen et al. [2002]). Field observations of\nthese low-angle, Devonian, detachment structures have been\nmade in Hinn\u00f8ya [L\u00f8seth and Tveten, 1996] and northern\nAustva\u02dag\u00f8ya (this study). However, such low-angle struc-\ntures are only likely to have a limited effect on the location\nand orientation of steeply dipping Mesozoic basin bounding\nextensional structures, and therefore further structural\ninfluence is required. Geophysical studies [Sellevoll, 1983;\nOlesen et al., 1997, 2002] in central and northern Norway\nshow the Lofoten Ridge to be associated with strong\nmagnetic and gravimetric anomalies. A positive gravity\nanomaly beneath the south and central Lofoten Ridge are\nbelieved to reflect a shallow Moho discontinuity and\nuplifted high-grade rocks of intermediate density [Sellevoll,\n1983; Olesen et al., 2002]. This exhumation of rocks from\nthe deep crust has led some authors to describe Lofoten as a\n\u2018\u2018core complex\u2019\u2019 [Hames and Anderson, 1996] which may\nhave developed as far back as the Devonian.\n[73] Recent Apatite fission track (AFT) studies suggest\nthat the LVA has undergone differential block uplift in post-\nCaledonian times (Figure 15b). Hendriks and Andriessen\n[2002] document various AFT ages along the LVA indicat-\ning differential vertical movements across the area. The\noldest cooling\/denudation ages were observed on Lang\u00f8ya,\nwhich indicate uplift\/exhumation during the Permian\/Trias-\nsic. North Lofoten on the other hand shows evidence for\ncooling\/denudation from Mid-Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.\nIt is possible that the earlier exhumed Lang\u00f8ya block acted\nas a barrier to the developing WLBF, thus leading to it\ndeflecting eastward toward the already established Vestfjor-\nden-Vanna fault complex [Olesen et al., 1997]. As the\nWLBF changes in trend, strain is also accommodated by\neast dipping faults farther offshore, and to the west of the\nLangoya Block, thus leading to a Jurassic\/Cretaceous basin\nbound on three sides on Vestera\u02dalen (Figure 15b) [Dalland,\n1981; Davidsen et al., 2001].\n[74] A third model is one of basement buoyancy similar\nto the models proposed by Bott [1967] and Donato et al.\n[1983] for parts of the North Sea. The rocks of the north\nLofoten Ridge are dominated by an anorthosite-mangerite-\ncharnockite-granite (AMCG) suite of plutons (Figure 15c)\n[Griffin et al., 1978; Corfu, 2004a] dating from \u00011.8 Ga.\nThe basement rocks on south Lofoten on the other hand are\ndominantly older Archaean\/Paleoproterozoic gneisses\n[Tveten, 1978; Corfu, 2004a]. These granites typically have\na slightly lower density than the surrounding basement\nrocks, which may lead to a slight buoyancy effect of the\ngranites as they move toward equilibrium with the sur-\nrounding basement [Bott, 1967]. This basement buoyancy\neffect has been used to explain the tectonic stability and\/or\nuplift of areas underlain by granites [Bott, 1967; Donato et\nal., 1983]. In addition, it has been suggested that this\nstability is most effective during times of extension [Bott\net al., 1978]. It is possible that the AMCG suite may have\ncontrolled the trend and development of the north Lofoten\nRidge in this manner (Figure 15c). However, as these\ngranites are of Precambrian age, it is likely that they reached\nequilibrium with surrounding rocks long before the Creta-\nceous, although it is possible that this buoyancy effect may\nhave influenced the development of the Devonian detach-\nments described above [Olesen et al., 2002]. This may also\nexplain the apparent elevated nature of the Lofoten Ridge\nthrough time [Sherlock, 2001]. Although each of the models\npresented in Figure 15 are presented as mutually exclusive\nhypotheses, they may all play a role in the development of\nthe ridge and could be applicable in combination.\n7. Conclusions and Implications for Future\nExploration on the Norwegian Margin\n[75] Through an integrated onshore, offshore and regional\nto outcrop-scale fault study we present a self-consistent\nstructural model for transtension and structural segmentation\nalong the Lofoten Ridge. Segment orientations relative to\nthe direction of regional extension appear to play a critical\nrole in determining the structural architecture of each\nparticular ridge segment [see also Taylor et al., 1994; Clifton\nand Schlische, 2003].\n[76] The Lofoten-Vestera\u02dalen archipelago can be divided\ninto a series of distinct structural domains reflecting varying\nfault patterns. These domains are concurrent with changes\nin trend of the Lofoten Ridge; therefore we attribute these\nvariations in fault\/fracture pattern to changes in a (the angle\nbetween the trend of the ridge and the regional extension\nvector; Figures 1, 12, and 13). Analysis of lineament trends\nand kinematic analysis of field data (including paleostress\ninversion) suggest a maximum horizontal extension (Ehmax)\ndirection of \u0001320\u0001 to 325\u0001 in north Lofoten. This corre-\nsponds to a bx value of \u000160\u0001 and thus an a of \u000130\u0001.\nTherefore regional extension associated with this deforma-\ntion is WNW-ESE. This model for oblique extension is\nsupported by offshore variations depocenter location and\nfault geometry, with deep basins and simple faulting typical\nof areas where the ridge\/border fault is orthogonal to\nextension, and complex faulting and less subsidence in\nmore oblique settings. The changes in fault orientation,\nfault geometry and inferred extension directions for each\ndomain in the Lofoten are consistent with analogue\nstudies and experimental clay models of where the bound-\nary conditions become increasingly oblique to extension\n(Figure 12) [Withjack and Jamison, 1986; Clifton et al.,\n2000; Clifton and Schlische, 2003; Dewey, 2002].\n[77] No major basement structures (e.g., shear zones)\nhave been identified either onshore or offshore separating\nsegment domains, and are thus instead interpreted as zones\nof soft linkage or accommodation zones. Therefore previ-\nTC4018 WILSON ET AL.: TRANSTENSION AND SEGMENTATION IN LOFOTEN\n25 of 28\nTC4018\nously identified transfer zones segmenting the Lofoten\nRidge, such as the Mosken and Jennegga transfer zones\n(Figure 2) [Tsikalas et al., 2001] may thus be attributed to\nchanges in deformation style between margin segments of\ndiffering obliquity (i.e., second-order transfer zones) rather\nthan reactivation of basement structures as proposed for\nother transfer zones on the margin (e.g., Bivrost and\nVestera\u02dalen transfer zones; first-order transfer zones).\n[78] Our results highlight that zones of oblique exten-\nsion generally exhibit complex fault patterns characteristic\nof 3-D strain, and also less localized deformation com-\npared to areas of orthogonal extension. These variations in\nstructural style and depocenter location seen along the\nLofoten Ridge may have important implications when\nassessing the likelihood of hydrocarbon plays and reser-\nvoir potential along other orthogonal and oblique rift\nsegments of the Norwegian, and other, passive margins\n(e.g., Nordland Ridge, Utr\u00f8st Ridge and Gjallar Ridge\n[Mosar, 2003]). A number of recent studies of basement\nridge structures on the Norwegian margin have shown that\nridge trend relative to the regional sortening\/extension\nvector plays an important role in the complexity of basins\nand potential reservoir plays [e.g., Gernigon et al., 2003;\nRen et al., 2003; Imber et al., 2005]. Many of these\nstudies attribute these complex reservoirs to later reactiva-\ntion of rift systems [e.g., Imber et al., 2005]. Our study\nbroadly confirms this suggestion and additionally illus-\ntrates that these zones of complexity can form early in the\ndevelopment of rifted margin due to variations in initial\nrift trend that may be themselves controlled by features\noriginating in the deeper basement.\n[79] Acknowledgments.
