Scope: monograph. Level: professional physicists, researchers and PhD\nstudents.\nA deep chasm still separates the microscopic world of atoms and molecules from the famil-\niar macroscopic world that is part of everyday life. These worlds are profoundly different.\nIn the former, time is reversible and the dynamics is Hamiltonian whereas, in the latter,\nwe see dissipation, increasing entropy, and a very definite arrow of time. For equilibrium\nsystems, Boltzmann\u2019s revolutionary ideas of a century ago provide deep insight, and have\nstood the test of time. Supplemented by the quantum statistical mechanics that came\nlater, they lead to an excellent description of large-scale behaviour based on properties\nat the atomic and molecular scale. Thus equilibrium thermodynamics can be derived\nconvincingly from statistical mechanics, with only a few leaps of faith along the way. The\nonly requirement is that the number of particles should be large. For non-equilibrium and\nopen systems, however, there are few such certainties. The discovery (or rediscovery) of\ndynamical chaos added a further dimension to the problem, because the statistical fea-\ntures typically observed in systems with many degrees of freedom can also be generated\nby deterministic chaos in simple systems. So what is the connection, if any?\nThe main aim of the authors is to show that a proper understanding of statistical\nmechanics requires a combination of concepts and techniques developed for dynamical\nsystems, as well as the usual statistical ideas. The book consists of 8 chapters, falling into\n3 fairly distinct parts. Their intention was not to write a treatise on either dynamical\nsystems, or on statistical mechanics, but to try to bring these two topics together in a\nfairly self-contained and coherent kind of way.\nThe first three chapters provide an introduction to deterministic chaos and complexity.\nThey cover topics like unpredictability, chaos, probabilistic treatments, Lyapunov expo-\nnents, entropies, information theory, and coarse-graining. In Part II the authors change\ngear abruptly, embark on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics, and discuss ergodic\ntheory. But fairly quickly, dynamical ideas also creep in, including the connection between\nnon-integrability and ergodicity, the KAM theorem, and the role of chaos in statistical\nmechanics. There are interesting historical remarks about the contributions of Fermi\nand Kolmogorov. Chapters 5 and 6 take the bull by the horns and tackle the origins of\nmacroscopic irreversibility, and the role of chaos in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics\nrespectively. Coarse-graining returns at the start of Part III, in Chapter 7, where the\nauthors describe four distinct levels of description: microsccopic, describing solvent and\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 51, 186-187 (2010).\ncolloidal particles (in terms of the Hamiltonian equations of motion and the Liouville\nequation); mesoscopic I, describing only colloidal particles (stochastic equations, Kramers\nequation); mesoscopic II, describing only the positions of colloidal particles (stochastic\nequations and Smoluchowski equation); and finally the macroscopic level, describing only\nspatial distributions of colloidal particles (Fick equation). The closing chapter is devoted\nto the renormalisation group (RG) as a means of deriving \u201ceffective low-dimensional de-\nscriptions to capture large-scale and\/or long-term behaviour\u201d. Although the account is\nsuccinct, it covers RG philosophy, relationship to multiscale approaches, scaling theories,\ncritical exponents, Green\u2019s function approaches, central limit theorem, and much else.\nHave the authors succeeded in pulling together this broad sweep of physics into a single\nentity? I believe that to a large extent they have. The book is mostly written in very good\nEnglish, albeit rather Italianate: native speakers may find it hard to skim-read because\nsentences sometimes have to be re-read, in order to find where to place the emphasis. But\nthis hardly matters, as it is a high level text that requires close attention anyway and\nthere will be relatively few physicists who are familiar with all the diverse areas covered.\nIt can be recommended for senior postgraduate students and researchers interested in a\nfresh perspective on the links between microscopic and macroscopic physics. They will\nfind many useful ideas and connections and, although there are no easy answers, that a\nbroad picture does seem to be emerging.\nPeter V. E. McClintock\nLancaster University.\n"}
