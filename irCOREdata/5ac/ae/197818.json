Analysis of data\ncollected shows that network visualisation can be an important curation tool for\neducators interested in cultivating student engagement.\nKeywords: student engagement; data visualisation; social networks\nIntroduction\nDiscussion-based education is far from new. The Socratic method, in which the\neducator engaged with the student through discussion and questioning on a one to\none basis, gave rise to the viva voce1 style of assessment of knowledge. While this\ntime-honoured method is effective, it is difficult to apply to large groups of students\nas the staff-student ratio climbs ever higher, particularly in the case of younger\neducators less confident in their depth of knowledge or who have been asked to teach\noutside of their narrow area of expertise. Online discussion boards are a feature of\nmost virtual learning environments (VLEs) (Cann et al. 2006), yet they are frequently\nunderused, used to ask low-level organisational questions, or, if linked to assessment,\nused grudgingly to get the marks (e.g. Lee, Kim, and Hackney 2011). In contrast, a\nvisit to a computer user area in any university reveals rows of screens displaying the\nfamiliar Facebook livery (www.facebook.com), where access to such services is not\nbanned. Student online attention is focussed on sites that with an \u2018\u2018activity stream\u2019\u2019\narchitecture, a design that focuses and reinforces attention by returning current active\nitems to the top of the users home screen. The contrast between students\u2019\nengagement with public social network services and online education tools is stark\n(Jones, Gaffney-Rhys, and Jones 2011).\n(page number not for citation purpose)\n*Corresponding author.

In a context prior to that\ninvolving social networks, Mann went on to describe the problem of lack of\nengagement as a failure of communication (Mann 2005). However, engagement is\nmore than participation \u0001 it requires emotion and sense-making as well as activity\n(Harper and Quaye 2009). Descriptions of beliefs around student engagement are\ninteresting but cannot inform educators as to how to guide individual students.\nSocial networks are rapidly moving beyond their original purpose and are\ninevitably becoming part of the learner experience (Conole and Alevizou 2010).\nMinocha (2009) gives numerous examples of the use of social software to promote\nengagement. The promise of social software to engage distance education students is\ngreat (Lester and Perini 2010). According to social learning theory (Bandura 1977),\nindividuals\u2019 active engagement functions as an initial motive for achieving desirable\nlearning outcomes. However, most if not all of the published studies of any size\nconcentrate on the softer, social side of student engagement rather than on academic\noutcomes (Hawe and Ghali 2008; Lefever and Currant 2010; Madge et al. 2009). Yu\net al. (2010) suggest that online social networking directly influences university\nstudents\u2019 learning outcomes, and a more recent study found that time spent on\nFacebook engaged in various activities can be positively predictive, negatively\npredictive, or positively and negatively predictive of student engagement (Junco\n2012). Notably, this paper found that there is a connection between online\nengagement and engagement in offline activities.\nTo address the issue of measuring whether student engagement in a peer to peer\ndiscussion in an activity stream (\u2018\u2018Facebook-like\u2019\u2019) environment could also be used to\ninform educators how to guide individual students, we conducted research to\ndiscover if student contributions to a social network could be used to discern student\nengagement with education, and also to investigate how complex data from social\nnetwork activity can be interpreted effectively using emerging graphical tools which\ngive a far richer picture of online activity than summary statistics.\nBackground\nAll first year undergraduate students in the School of Biological Sciences at the\nUniversity of Leicester (approximately 250 students per year) take common key skills\nmodules that encompass Information Technology (IT) and numeracy skills. For two\nyears, this module has included assessed use of a portfolio of freely available Web 2.0\ntools. In 2009\/2010 the authors introduced a social network element to encourage\npeer support and discussion of scientific and technical issues relevant to the\ncurriculum. In active social networks, \u2018\u2018friends\u2019\u2019 status updates form intermittent\nvariable rewards, one of the most powerful methods of operant conditioning (Ferster\nand Skinner 1957; Zeiler 1968). We sought to derive student engagement with the\nprocess of academic reflection from these attributes. Although Facebook is pre-\neminent in commanding student attention (Long 2010), we decided not to use this\nsite in order to avoid complications arising from the overlap of social and\nprofessional online identities (Baran 2010). Instead, we chose to use the Friendfeed\nsocial network (Friendfeed.com). None of the 2009\/2010 cohort of students entering\nJ.L. Badge et al.\n2\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nCitation: Research in Learning Technology 2012; 20: 16283 - DOI: 10.3402\/rlt.v20i0\/16283\nour degree courses had an existing Friendfeed account and so all created dedicated\naccounts for their degree course. We linked Friendfeed into the institutional VLE by\na link in the navigation sidebar of VLE module sites. Since Friendfeed logins are\npersistent, whenever students clicked this link in the VLE they moved seamlessly\nbetween the VLE and the social network.\nFriendfeed has a very similar structure to Facebook, allowing users to post entries\nthat can include links or attached files. Friendfeed was purchased by Facebook in\nAugust 2009, and with the merging of technologies, Facebook increasingly resembles\nFriendfeed. The vast majority of students were already familiar with Facebook and\nneeded little if any instruction in how to use the extremely similar Friendfeed\nenvironment. Like the Twitter microblogging service (twitter.com) but unlike\nFacebook, Friendfeed allows asymmetrical following, that is, non-reciprocal\nsubscriptions. In mathematical terms, this is referred to as a directed graph.\nSubscribers can \u2018\u2018Like\u2019\u2019 entries from the people they follow, or comment on them\nin a threaded fashion. Friendfeed accounts can be private or public (controlled by a\nsingle checkbox) but all operate on a friend of a friend (FOAF) basis. All students\nwere asked to subscribe to the three staff members involved in supporting the course\nand in turn, the staff subscribed to each student. The FOAF nature of the Friendfeed\nsystem meant that all students in the extended network saw any comments that the\nstaff members made on other student entries, regardless of whether they were\nsubscribed to that student themselves. We asked students to keep their existing\nFacebook accounts for private and social content, and reserve Friendfeed for\neducation-related reflections and content, in a similar approach to that suggested by\nprevious publications (Duffy 2010; Jones et al. 2010) and informed by our own prior\nexperience. We aimed to promote the creation of a peer-supported network of\nstudents that had the potential for discussion-led learning and engagement with\ncourse material. This network would be separate from personal social networks,\ndemonstrating the principles of professional development and conduct as scientists.\nMethodology\nThe study described in this paper was approved by the University of Leicester\nCommittee for Research Ethics Concerning Human Subjects prior to commencement.\nStudents were introduced to Friendfeed at the start of the module, given guidance via\nthe institutional VLE on the rationale for sharing information in this way, and on how\nFriendfeed use would be assessed. This was reinforced in practice throughout the\nmodule by academic staff input via Friendfeed itself and in voluntary face to face help\nsessions if students chose to attend these. Essentially, our approach was one of action\nresearch, as defined by Reason and Bradbury (2000), which developed in response to\nstudent use of the Friendfeed social network throughout the module.\nStudents were informed that they would be assessed on the number of\ncontributions they made to Friendfeed averaged over the course of an academic\nterm, with a minimum expectation of four academically-relevant items per week to\nqualify for the marks allotted. Contributions could be in the form of status updates,\ncomments on others updates, or shared links, but to count for credit, external links\nmust be accompanied by a short commentary explaining how and why it is relevant\nto academic study. Academic staff gave students support and feedback by joining in\nconversations on Friendfeed, using direct (private) messages where appropriate, as\nwell as in weekly face to face support sessions. Marks were awarded for activity over\nResearch in Learning Technology\nCitation: Research in Learning Technology 2012; 20: 16283 - DOI: 10.3402\/rlt.v20i0\/16283 3\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nthe course of the whole module. At the end of the 10 week assessment period allotted\nto this course, data was extracted from the Friendfeed application programming\ninterface (API) (http:\/\/friendfeed.com\/api). We used the open-source Gephi tool\n(http:\/\/gephi.org) to visualise the network graphs and perform statistical analysis of\nthe dataset. Gephi is a powerful tool that makes it easy to analyse individual elements\nof large networks.\nAll code used for this project is open-source and available at GitHub (http:\/\/\ngithub.com\/neilfws\/Friendfeed). Data were extracted using the Friendfeed applica-\ntion programming interface (API, http:\/\/Friendfeed.com\/api\/documentation). User\ndata were retrieved, parsed and stored as comma-separated value (CSV) files, using a\nscript written in the Ruby programming language. Statistical analyses were per-\nformed using the R programming environment (R Development Core Team 2011).\nResults\nActivity\nAlthough they could easily access the account details of the entire cohort via the\nVLE, most students formed relatively small networks with a median size of 21\npeople, somewhat smaller than the typical network size on other social services such\nas Facebook (Facebook Data Team 2009) and Twitter (Goncalves, Perra, and\nVespignani 2011). However, each student network overlapped with other networks,\nand the FOAF \u2018\u2018Like\u2019\u2019 feature on Friendfeed allowed information to be freely\ntransmitted from one network to another. Unlike Facebook, Friendfeed is a directed\nnetwork that allows asymmetric relationships between subscribers, but in spite of\nthis, the distribution of subscribers was very similar to that of subscriptions (data\nnot shown).\nContributions for credit made by students included shared links pointing at\nonline tools, resources and scientific news, but also status update entries that\ncontained reflection on the learning process. Students also received credit for adding\nto existing discussion threads comments containing significant reflective content or\ncommentary. Figure 1 summarises student activity at the end of the 10 week\nassessment period. The number of substantive comments showed a greater range\nthan the number of direct entries, reflecting the distribution of students who\ncompleted the online exercise to earn the credits allotted to it and students who\nengaged deeply with this approach to networked learning. As with comments, the\nnumber of \u2018\u2018Likes\u2019\u2019 awarded across peer networks showed a considerable range. Over\n10 weeks, 134 students whose accounts we were able to analyse in detail via the\nFriendfeed API produced 5376 entries, ranging from a single word to several hundred\nwords, 8151 comments, 5232 \u2018\u2018Likes\u2019\u2019, and wrote 199853 words (an average of 1491\neach, not including private messages).\nFigure 2 shows contributions broken down by type and gender. There are clear\ngender differences for each of the four types of contribution. Statistical analysis\nconfirms that females make more significantly contributions than males (Wilcoxon\nrank sum test, pB0.05). This data is summarised in Table 1.\nStudents were assessed on the number of contributions they made to over the\ncourse of an academic term, with a minimum expectation of four academically-\nrelevant items per week to qualify for the marks allotted. Female students scored\nhigher marks than males (median mark 100 versus 75). This difference is statistically\nJ.L. Badge et al.\n4\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nCitation: Research in Learning Technology 2012; 20: 16283 - DOI: 10.3402\/rlt.v20i0\/16283\nsignificant (Wilcoxon rank sum test, pB0.001). Assessment of contributions to the\nsocial network formed only part (40%) of the overall module mark. In contrast to\nassessment of Friendfeed contributions, there was no significant overall gender\ndifference in overall module marks excluding the social network contributions\n(Wilcoxon rank sum test, p\u00020.05). This finding suggests that although female\nstudents make more online contributions than males, typical male students tend to be\nstrategically focussed on meeting assessment criteria.\nOverall, Spearman\u2019s correlation test shows a very strong and statistically\nsignificant link between marks awarded for the Friendfeed exercise and other marks\nawarded (excluding the Friendfeed mark) (r\u00020.75, pB0.001). This strongly supports\nthe argument that Friendfeed performance is an accurate proxy for student\nengagement.\nHowever, these crude summary statistics address the behaviour of the entire\ncohort and are not representative of individual students. For example, each of the\ndistributions of entries, subscriptions, comments and likes is skewed, with many\nstudents making relatively low number of contributions and a few students making\nlarge numbers. In contrast to the summary statistics, the individual who made the\nhighest number of academically-relevant comments was male (Table 1). In order to\ntry to achieve a more sophisticated individual assessment of student engagement,\nFigure 1. Boxplots of student contributions to Friendfeed.

In this study we have performed social network analysis\nthrough data visualisation, content analysis (see above), and minimal context analysis\nthrough a course questionnaire and exemplar student comments (see later). The\nFriendfeed data can be used to visualise three types of network:\n(1) Subscriptions (or \u2018\u2018following\u2019\u2019).\n(2) Comments (made and received).\n(3) Likes (affirmations which refocus attention by moved the liked item to the\ntop of the activity stream).\nIn order to investigate network relationships, we used Gephi to visualise\ninteractions in student networks. Although Gephi makes it easy to analyse the beha-\nviour of individuals and groups within large networks, for simplicity we only present\nhere a static overview of network structure here. (The live data in Gephi presents a\nmuch enhanced vision of the contributions of each individual within the network.)\nFigure 3 demonstrates the central role of staff members who act as \u2018\u2018authorities\u2019\u2019\nby subscribing to all students (in green). It also illustrates highly engaged students\nwho act as \u2018\u2018hubs\u2019\u2019, facilitating network building. These individuals subscribe to\nmany other students, hence the term \u2018\u2018hub\u2019\u2019 (equivalent to Facebook \u2018\u2018friends\u2019 or\nTwitter \u2018\u2018followers\u2019\u2019). It is important to note that although all the data in this paper\nhas been anonymised for ethical reasons, in the \u2018\u2018live\u2019\u2019 Gephi view, the identity of\neach node is revealed by popup labels when the operator hovers the mouse pointer\nover a node. Thus the identity of individual students can be instantly and easily\nrevealed amid the mass of network data.\nGephi contains several algorithmic community detection tools such as modular-\nity maximisation (Newman 2004), which shows possible divisions of a network based\non modularity \u0001 groups of nodes with dense internal connections within modules but\nonly sparse connections with different modules. Using the community detection tools\nin Gephi on this data, three communities emerge (Figure 4). These three communities\nappear to characterise three different types of student:\n(1) A very active group (shown in red in Figure 4), where a lot of the interaction\nstems from the green \u2018\u2018authority\u2019\u2019 node \u0001 that is, contacts with the staff in the\nnetwork.\n(2) A smaller group (coloured purple in Figure 4), who prefer to \u2018\u2018talk amongst\nthemselves\u2019\u2019.\n(3) A mid-sized group (coloured blue in Figure 4), who prefer to remain on the\nperiphery and interact mainly with group (2) rather than with staff.\nIn addition to network visualisations, Gephi also provides summary network\nstatistics (Table 2).\nQualitative student feedback and their use of the network\nIn addition to network analysis, an end of module questionnaire was used to elicit\nstudent feedback on the exercise. Although some negative views were expressed by a\nminority of students:\nResearch in Learning Technology\nCitation: Research in Learning Technology 2012; 20: 16283 - DOI: 10.3402\/rlt.v20i0\/16283 7\n(page number not for citation purpose)\n. Friendfeed was an annoying intrusion into what I wanted to do with my own\nlearning in biology.\n. I found Friendfeed a distraction, and prevented me from doing other work\nwhich would have been more useful.\nMost of the student feedback was positive:\n. I found Friendfeed useful and enjoyed doing it even though some weeks it\nwasn\u2019t at the top of my to do list and got a bit neglected now and then.

Friendfeed was very useful for addressing queries from students, and for open\ndiscussions between students and teachers.\n. Friendfeed is great for improving communication between staff and students.\n. Friendfeed was very effective in motivating me to discuss the topics regarding\nour lectures and questioning some of them during the Friendfeed posts. It is\nalso a good way to keep up to date with any upcoming assessments and seeing\nthe progress my other colleagues have made motivated me to catch up with\nthem and do well in the assessments. Also, it is a helpful way of getting some\nquestions asked since everyone can contribute and a one to one meeting is not\nnecessary since you can log in to Friendfeed anytime.\nFigure 4.

Initially these were practically based, such as\ndiscussions about which text books to buy and where the best prices could be\nfound. Such object-orientated discussions include academic-related news items that\nenabled students to focus their attention on current news relevant to subject courses.\nStudents separated social comments for Facebook and academic ones for\nFriendfeed with ease. A very few \u2018\u2018inappropriate\u2019\u2019 (i.e. social rather than academic)\ncomments were dealt with by discrete responses from staff and these discussions\nmoved to Facebook quickly. Later in the term, when revising for examinations,\nstudents began spontaneously to share best practice on different learning\ntechniques.\nFurther evidence justifying the approach of using social software to engage\nstudents in discussion about both science and their own learning is suggested by the\nnumber of students who continued to use the service beyond the end of the\nassessment period and indeed across university vacations, continuing to discuss\ncurrent scientific issues reported in the media. In contrast to other social services we\nhave tested which very few students continued to use post assessment (\u00031%),\napproximately 15% of students continued to use Friendfeed, posting items for\ndiscussion and commenting on academic issues. Although still a minority of the\ncohort, this still represents an increase in engagement from that seen previously with\nother tools, and engaged students have continued to use Friendfeed for over a year\nsince it was formally required.\nDiscussion\nAnalysis of the contribution of network structure to learning is an emerging topic in\neducation (Dawson 2010). The work presented here shows how the freely available\ntools we have developed and used can be applied to data mined from popular social\nnetworks to inform educational practices. This study aimed to investigate whether a\nTable 2.

The connections and interactions between students were analysed\nusing publicly-available network analysis tools. This data shows that students formed\nconnections to one another not only as subscribers but also through commenting on\neach other contributions to the network and through threaded conversations. Use of\nthis social network curation approach to student engagement has now been taken up\nby other academic disciplines within this university. This trend is likely to continue,\nand Longman and Green (2011) argue that the emerging post-print digital culture of\nknowledge creation and dissemination in higher education is even more demanding\nof effective and committed teaching than hitherto.\nWhile the numbers of students still active in the network after the compulsory\nassessment period is not high, it is an order of magnitude greater than that observed\nin other similar situations. This observation supports the view that teaching students\nto use isolated tools is not effective, as there is no narrative rationale that supports\nand engages them in increasing their understanding beyond completion of basic\nassessment tasks. \u2018\u2018Authentic assessment\u2019\u2019 in which marks are awarded for tasks\nwhich students perceive to be clearly linked to their course of study rather than\ndesigned to familiarise themselves with arbitrary technologies is also important for\nengagement. For this reason we required that student contributions to Friendfeed be\nrelevant to the degree course to count for credit rather then mere social chat. Our\ncontention, supported by the data presented here, is that object-oriented social\nnetworks such as Friendfeed (and Facebook) provide \u2018\u2018social glue\u2019\u2019 which both\nprovides rationale and encourages student engagement with scientific and academic\nissues. Although this paper investigates the use the Friendfeed social network, there is\nno reason why the conclusions drawn cannot be applied in a wider context to any\nsocial tool with similar attributes.\nA recent study suggests that teaching staff are positioned in a higher proportion\nof the higher-performing than lower-performing student networks (Dawson 2010).\nThis entirely agrees with our observations and suggests that focussing student\nattention online has a significant a role to play as do face to face interactions in the\nlecture room or laboratory. The same study also suggests that higher-performing\nstudents primarily develop connections with students of a similar academic capacity.\nThe implication is that where online communication channels are adopted, teaching\nstaff need to ensure they have adequate network connections with all students, but\nespecially to cultivate connections with and the networks of lower-performers. On\nsocial networks such as Twitter it has become accepted to use network interactions as\na proxy for engagement (e.g. Huston, Benyoucef, and Weiss 2011).\nOne of the potential risks of this project was that students would confuse\nbehaviour commonly seen in purely social online networks with a professional\nrepresentation of their online identity that enhances their reputation. Students were\nmade aware that they could control if their Friendfeed activity was public or private,\napproximately two thirds of students opted for a public account. Very few instances\nof publicly inappropriate online behaviour were observed, possibly due to the fact\nthat participating students were encouraged to separate their new, professional online\nidentities from pre-existing online social identities. Less successful were attempts to\nencourage students to engage in peer review of colleagues online activity as a\nmeans of introducing them to this central concept. Even using the private \u2018\u2018direct\nmessage\u2019\u2019 channel, students were not willing or able to produce a balanced review\nthat contained appropriate criticism or suggestions for improvement. Instead, they\nResearch in Learning Technology\nCitation: Research in Learning Technology 2012; 20: 16283 - DOI: 10.3402\/rlt.v20i0\/16283 11\n(page number not for citation purpose)\nproduced overtly complimentary commentaries even when defects were apparent.\nAlthough private, these peer reviews were not anonymous, which may have been part\nof the problem, but we suspect it is more likely that these junior scientists were\ninsufficiently confident of their own abilities so that they were unwilling to criticise\ndefects in others.\nConclusions\nThe purpose of this investigation has been to explore if social network tools such\nFriendfeed can be used to move away from teaching isolated facts to isolated students\ntowards a more collaborative approach to science education in which student peer\nnetworks leverage academic input for maximum engagement. The outcomes to date\nhave been sufficiently positive to encourage us to continue to develop a social\napproach to science education using freely available public networks to support and\nengage students. No published studies to date have looked specifically at the\neducational potential of the Friendfeed system, although recent studies have indicated\nthat specific types of Facebook use do correlate with engagement (Junco 2012). This is\nin agreement with the findings presented here and suggests that social network-\nmediated academic activity has considerable untapped educational potential.\nThe data analysed in this paper represents only a fraction of the total interactions\nbetween students and between students and teaching staff that occur, since face to\nface interactions and private backchannel interactions cannot, and ethically should\nnot, be captured and analysed. Nevertheless, network data captured via public API\u2019s\nand visualised with free open source tools provides a simple and powerful proxy for\nstudent engagement which moves beyond crude summary statistics of online\nbehaviour and promises to provide more subtle and effective ways for educators to\nmeasure and guide student engagement with academic learning.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful for funding which contributed to this work received from the University of\nLeicester Teaching Enhancement Fund and the HEA UK Centre for Biosciences.\nNote\n1.
