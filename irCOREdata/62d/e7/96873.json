is that\\ as a result\\ any initial slight\ndi}erence between the neighbours will become\nself!amplifying\\ generating a full!blown spatial pat!\ntern of inhomogeneity[ This mechanism\\ which we\nshall call lateral inhibition with feedback\\ has been\nproposed in several experimental contexts \"Goriely\net al[\\ 0880^ Heitzler + Simpson\\ 0880^ Sternberg\\\n0882# and is supported by

been\nidenti_ed as products of speci_c neurogenic genes[ In\nparticular\\ extensive genetic and biochemical studies\nhave identi_ed the product of the neurogenic gene\nNotch \"and its homologues in
