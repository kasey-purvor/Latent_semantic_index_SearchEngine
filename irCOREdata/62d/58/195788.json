Recent discussions of such bursts concerned intervals during which the IMF By component was negative. The present study concerns an interval of By-positive IMF which occurred on 20 March 2002 (01:00-12:00UT). During the interval By increased steadily from ~2 to 12nT, whilst the Bz component decreased steadily from ~10 to 0nT. There was thus a ~6-h sub-interval during which the IMF clock angle remained between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, such that moderate dayside reconnection and open flux production was maintained. It is found that flow bursts of a similar size and speed to those observed under B\u03b3 negative (~1000m s-1, spanning 2-3h of MLT in the midnight sector) also occur when By is positive. However, the direction of east-west flow is reversed, indicating that they are driven by processes in the magnetosphere which are directly related to the orientation of the IMF.

Recent discussions of such bursts concerned intervals during which the IMF By component was negative. The present study concerns an interval of By-positive IMF which occurred on 20 March 2002 (01:00-12:00UT). During the interval By increased steadily from ~2 to 12nT, whilst the Bz component decreased steadily from ~10 to 0nT. There was thus a ~6-h sub-interval during which the IMF clock angle remained between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, such that moderate dayside reconnection and open flux production was maintained.

This paper further addresses the issue of night-\nside flow bursts which occur during intervals of northward\nbut strongly BY -influenced IMF. Recent discussions of such\nbursts concerned intervals during which the IMF BY compo-\nnent was negative. The present study concerns an interval of\nBY -positive IMF which occurred on 20 March 2002 (01:00\u2013\n12:00 UT). During the interval BY increased steadily from\n\u223c2 to 12 nT, whilst the BZ component decreased steadily\nfrom \u223c10 to 0 nT. There was thus a \u223c6-h sub-interval dur-\ning which the IMF clock angle remained between 30\u25e6 and\n60\u25e6, such that moderate dayside reconnection and open flux\nproduction was maintained. It is found that flow bursts of a\nsimilar size and speed to those observed under BY negative\n(\u223c1000 m s\u22121, spanning 2\u20133 h of MLT in the midnight sec-\ntor) also occur when BY is positive. However, the direction\nof east-west flow is reversed, indicating that they are driven\nby processes in the magnetosphere which are directly related\nto the orientation of the IMF. It is suggested that they are\ncaused by a reconfiguration of an asymmetric tail resulting\nfrom prolonged dayside reconnection with a BY -dominated\nIMF. This is consistent with previous suggestions that they\nare associated with convective transport following reconnec-\ntion in the more distant tail. Analysis of ground magnetic\ndata, auroral images and geosynchronous particle data also\nshow associated features, but indicate that the flow bursts are\nnot directly associated with substorms.\nKey words. Ionosphere (plasma convection; ionosphere-\nmagnetosphere interactions) \u2013 Magnetospheric Physics\n(magnetotail)\n1 Introduction\nThe relationship between the nature of the upstream inter-\nplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the concurrent pattern\nof high-latitude ionospheric plasma convection is reasonably\nwell understood (e.g. Reiff and Burch, 1985; Cowley and\nCorrespondence to: A. Grocott\n(ag27@ion.le.ac.uk)\nLockwood, 1992). In the dayside ionosphere, this relation-\nship is relatively simple, with an immediate response of the\nionospheric plasma flow to changes in the IMF readily ob-\nservable (e.g. Clauer et al., 1984; Etemadi et al., 1988; Todd\net al., 1988; Lockwood et al., 1989, 1993; Elphic et al., 1990;\nPinnock et al., 1993, 1995; Moen et al., 1995; Provan et\nal., 1998; Milan et al., 2000). Flows in the nightside iono-\nsphere, however, are more directly controlled by magneto-\nspheric dynamics than by the instantaneous nature of the IMF\n(e.g. de la Beaujardie`re et al., 1994; Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr, 1997;\nOpgenoorth and Pellinen, 1998; Grocott et al., 2002, 2003,\n2004). Although the dynamics of the magnetosphere itself\nare largely influenced by the IMF (e.g. Dungey, 1961; Far-\nrugia et al., 1993), the magnetotail actively modulates this\ninfluence, adding an extra dimension to the complexity of\nnightside plasma flows. Substorms, for example, are known\nto influence the nature of nightside convection in a number\nof ways (Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr, 1997; Opgenoorth and Pellinen,\n1998; Grocott et al., 2002). Recent observations of flows\nduring geomagnetically \u201cquiet\u201d intervals (e.g. Huang et al.,\n2001; Walker et al., 1998, 2002; Senior et al., 2002; Grocott\net al., 2003) have further demonstrated the diversity in night-\nside convection by revealing a multitude of different flow\nphenomena associated with various conditions of the IMF.\nThe particular phenomenon discussed in detail by Senior\net al. (2002) and Grocott et al. (2003) were bursts of fast\n(\u223c1000 m s\u22121) westward auroral zone flow in the nightside\nionosphere (see, e.g. Fig. 1). These were observed during\nextended intervals of modest dayside driving associated with\na northward IMF which was dominated by a large negative\nBycomponent. No substorm activity was observed in associ-\nation with the bursts, which were interpreted as being related\nto episodic reconnection in the distant magnetotail associated\nwith the closing of open magnetic flux. The present paper\ncontinues this investigation by discussing intervals of Super-\nDARN radar observations of nightside flows during which\nthe IMF was again northward, but now with a significant pos-\nitive By component. The principal aims of this study were\nto identify firstly, whether similar bursts occur under such\nconditions and secondly, whether the direction and location\n1756 A.

The exact time interval of each map is\nindicated in the top left-hand corner, and to the left of each map the\ntotal transpolar voltage VPC , and the direction and magnitude (in\nthe Y -Z plane) of the lagged IMF are also indicated (adapted from\nGrocott et al., 2003).\nof a burst are determined by the IMF By component. Both\nare found to be the case, with eastward bursts having similar\nspeeds (and similar associated values of transpolar voltage)\nbeing observed in the midnight sector auroral zone. Obser-\nvations from a six hour interval on 20 March 2002 are dis-\ncussed here in detail (some examples from other intervals are\nalso shown), along with a theory on the origin of the bursts.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe main instrumentation employed in this study is that\nof the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)\n(Greenwald et al., 1995). Data from the nine HF radars\nwhich comprise the Northern Hemisphere component of the\nnetwork have been used to derive large-scale maps of the\nhigh-latitude convection using the \u201cMap Potential\u201d model\n(Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998). The line-of-sight veloci-\nties are mapped onto a polar grid, and used to determine\na solution for the electrostatic potential which is expressed\nin spherical harmonics up to sixth order.

These are plotted on a geomagnetic grid with the\npole at the top and dusk to the left, down to 60\u25e6.

Information from the statisti-\ncal model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996), parame-\nterised by concurrent IMF conditions, is used to stabilise the\nsolution where no data are available. A Heppner-Maynard\nboundary (Heppner and Maynard, 1987), determined from\nthe line-of-sight velocity data, is also used to constrain the\nconvection pattern at lower latitudes. The flow vectors which\nwill be shown superposed on the electric equipotentials are\nderived using the SuperDARN line-of-sight velocity mea-\nsurements with the transverse velocity component provided\nby the spherical harmonic fits.\nThe fields-of-view of those SuperDARN radars which\nspanned the nightside ionosphere at 07:00 UT (the central\ntime of the main interval studied) are shown in Fig. 2. These\nare presented in Altitude Adjusted Corrected Geomagnetic\n(AACGM) coordinates, a development of the PACE system\ndiscussed by Baker and Wing (1989). Midnight magnetic\nlocal time (MLT) is at the bottom and dusk is to the left.\nThe locations and identifier codes of a set of magnetome-\nters used are also displayed on Fig. 2. Data have been in-\nspected from magnetograms of these two arrays which move\nthrough the midnight sector during the study interval. These\nare the Canadian CANOPUS array (Grant et al., 1992) and\nthe Greenland magnetometer chain (Friis-Christensen et al.,\n1985). Data from selected stations (denoted by the red-filled\ncircles) will be presented in H , D, and Z coordinates, where\nH is local magnetic north, D is local magnetic east, and Z\nis vertically down. The locations and codes of this subset of\nstations will also be indicated on the flow maps.\nIMF conditions for each study interval were measured by\nthe MAG instrument (Smith et al., 1999) on board the ACE\nspacecraft (Stone et al., 1998). During the 20 March inter-\nval ACE was located upstream at GSM coordinates (X, Y,\nZ)=(222,\u221214,\u221215) RE (with negligible movement over the\ninterval). Solar wind data obtained by the SWEPAM instru-\nment (McComas et al., 1998) were also used to estimate the\npropagation delay of field changes from ACE to the dayside\nionosphere using the algorithm of Khan and Cowley (1999).\nA. Grocott et al.: The influence of IMF By on nightside ionospheric flow 1757\nThis was found to be 71\u00b17 min for the 20 March interval and\nhas been used to lag the ACE IMF data displayed here. Simi-\nlar delay times were found for the other intervals studied and\nhave been used to lag the relevant IMF data as appropriate.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Upstream interplanetary conditions\nFigure 3 shows the lagged ACE interplanetary magnetic field\ndata in GSM coordinates for the interval 01:00\u201312:00 UT\non 20 March 2002, during which the IMF had both positive\nBZ and BY components. The clock angle increased steadily\nfrom less than 10\u25e6 (almost purely northward) at 01:00 UT, to\n\u223c90\u25e6 (purely duskward) at 12:00 UT. This corresponds to a\ndecrease in BZ over the interval from \u223c10 nT at 01:00 UT,\nto \u223czero by 12:00 UT, and an increase in BY which became\ndominant as it climbed from\u223c2 nT at 01:00 UT to\u223c12 nT by\n12:00 UT. BX remained steady at around 6 nT and the mag-\nnitude of the IMF remained strong between 13 and 16 nT\nthroughout the interval. The vertical dashed lines delimit the\ninterval of SuperDARN data which has been studied (04:00\u2013\n10:00 UT), during which the clock angle was at intermediate\nangles of 30\u25e6 to 60\u25e6 (such that, according to, for example,\nSandholt et al. (1998a, b) a modest level of dayside reconnec-\ntion should prevail). This is some 3 h after the IMF initially\nacquired its BY and BZ positive orientation, however, such\nthat the nightside flows should not have been influenced by\nany prior magnetospheric activity which might be associated\nwith more typically \u201cactive\u201d IMF conditions.\n3.2 SuperDARN observations of ionospheric flow\nAs mentioned above, SuperDARN data for this interval have\nbeen studied between 04:00 and 10:00 UT, corresponding to\nthe interval during which the IMF clock angle was between\n30\u25e6 and 60\u25e6. This also corresponds to the interval during\nwhich the coverage of SuperDARN data was sufficient to\nreasonably dominate the fitting of the ionospheric electric\npotential in the Map Potential model and produce reliable\nconvection maps. Figure 4 shows two such maps from early\non in the interval when the data spanned the dusk, dawn and\nnightside sectors sufficiently to produce reasonably complete\npictures of the ionospheric flow. The bold numbers on the\nmaps indicate the ionospheric electric potentials (discussed\nin Sect. 2) which, for the Northern Hemisphere, are negative\nat dusk (clockwise flow) and positive at dawn (anti-clockwise\nflow). The difference between the peaks of these positive and\nnegative potentials thus gives a useful indication of the mag-\nnitude of the convection over the polar cap, referred to as the\ntranspolar voltage.\nThe two maps shown are at (a) 05:30 and (b) 06:30 UT,\nrespectively, and show the calculated transpolar voltage, the\nAPL statistical convection model used, and an icon repre-\nsenting the IMF strength and orientation in the Y-Z plane.\nThese two maps are representative of the overall nature of\nthe flow during the interval, which is dominated by a large\n \n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nB X\n \n5\n10\n15\nB Y\n \n5\n10\n15\nB Z\n \n13\n14\n15\n16\n|B T\n|\n0200 0400 0600 0800 1000 1200\nUT\n \n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nCl\noc\nk \nAn\ngl\ne\nFigure 3\nFig. 3. Upstream interplanetary observations from the ACE space-\ncraft for 01:00\u201312:00 UT on 20 March 2002, lagged by 71 min to\naccount for the propagation delay to the ionosphere. The top three\npanels show IMF data in GSM co-ordinates, and the bottom two\npanels show the field magnitude and clock angle. The clock an-\ngle is defined with respect to north, such that 0\u25e6 corresponds to a\ntransverse field purely in the+z direction (northward), \u00b190\u25e6 to\u00b1y\n(respectively) and \u00b1180\u25e6 to \u2212z (southward).\ncrescent-shaped dawn cell extending from pre-midnight to\npost-dawn. Owing to the intermediate nature of the IMF\nclock angle during this interval, one might expect to observe\nboth Dungey-cycle and lobe convection cells (Crooker et al.,\n1998; Sandholt et al., 1998a, b, 2001). However, this is not\nwell addressed by the data employed (due to lack of complete\ncoverage) and since the presence of lobe cells is not germane\nto the subject of this study, they are not considered any fur-\nther. What is clearly evidenced by the data is the continued\nexcitation of Dungey-cycle twin-cell flow. The antisunward\nflow has a westward component over the polar cap, opposite\nto that reported by Grocott et al. (2003) for negative BY , and\nis exactly that expected for Dungey-cycle flow in the pres-\nence of positive IMF BY (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 1972; Reiff and\nBurch, 1985). The flow reversal boundary was observed at a\nmagnetic latitude of between 70\u25e6 and 75\u25e6 throughout the in-\nterval, although there was no trend apparent in any variation.\nThis implies a relatively constant size of polar cap and there-\nfore an approximate balance between dayside and nightside\nreconnection over the interval. Modest velocities of a few\n\u223c100 m s\u22121 persisted throughout the interval, with an aver-\nage transpolar voltage of \u223c30 kV.\n1758 A.

Flow maps illustrating the overall nature of ionospheric convection during the main interval discussed in this paper. Two maps are\nshown, the exact time of each being indicated in the top left-hand corner. The total transpolar voltage VPC , and the direction and magnitude\n(in the Y -Z plane) of the lagged IMF are also indicated, as in Fig. 1.\nInspection of the flow maps for the entire interval reveals\nthat convection did not persist at these average levels but, as\nwas found by Grocott et al. (2003), was instead interspersed\nwith bursts of much faster flow (>1000 m s\u22121) in the mid-\nnight sector, each lasting of the order of 10 min. These\nbursts (eight of which are illustrated in Fig. 5, panels (a\u2013\nh)) recurred on a time scale of 30\u201360 min and (usually) in-\nvolved an enhancement of the transpolar voltage by about\n5\u201310 kV above the background level. The peak flows during\neach burst are shown on maps of the nightside ionosphere\nwhich are otherwise presented in the same style as those in\nFig. 4, except for the filled black circles which indicate the\nlocations of key magnetometers, data from which are dis-\ncussed below. The geometry of each burst shown in Fig. 5 is\nessentially the same, involving flows which emanate from the\npolar cap in the pre-midnight sector and then reverse in sense,\ntravelling eastwards back towards the dayside via midnight.\nWhilst therefore similar to the bursts reported by Grocott et\nal. (2003), their direction is clearly opposite, apparently de-\ntermined by the sense of IMF BY . This is further evidenced\nby Fig. 6, which shows four bursts from two additional in-\ntervals of BZ-positive, BY -positive on 30 May 2001 (panels\n(a\u2013b)) and 23 September 2002 (panels (c\u2013d)). These four\nbursts (and indeed, bursts from a number of other intervals\nstudied) are similar in nature to those from the main interval\ndiscussed here, which would therefore appear to be common\nto the prevailing interplanetary conditions.\n3.3 Ground magnetometer data\nA representative subset of the magnetometer data inspected\nfor the 20 March interval is shown in Fig. 7, corresponding\nto the magnetometers indicated in Fig. 5 and to the red-filled\ncircles in Fig. 2. The vertical dashed lines indicate the times\nof the peaks in flow burst activity shown in Fig. 5. The top\ntwo traces, from the DAW and FSM magnetometers, show\nnegligible perturbations throughout the interval. As is ev-\nident from Fig. 5, these stations were located consistently\nequatorward of the main flow enhancements which occurred.\nThe first, and most significant signature, was at \u223c04:15 UT,\ncorresponding to the onset of the first flow burst (the peak\nof which is shown in Fig. 5 at 04:38 UT). This signature\nis largest in the RAN magnetometer data, which shows a\nsubstorm-like negative bay of \u223c120 nT. This was also the\ndisturbance with the largest spatial extent during the interval,\nhaving been observed by CON and FCH.

Flow maps illustrating the flow \u201cbursts\u201d from two additional intervals are shown in the same format as Fig. 1.\nabout 06:00 UT. The most eastern of the CANOPUS stations\n(such as GIL, illustrated) also show a noticeable impulsive\nincrease in Pi2 amplitude at around 04:15 UT. This enhanced\nPi2-band activity then remained for the duration of the in-\nterval. Other magnetometers in the chain also recorded the\nPi2 activity but without observing a significant perturbation\nin the unfiltered H-component.\nIt is worth noting that images from the SIE instrument on\nboard the IMAGE spacecraft (Mende et al., 2000a, b) (not\nshown) indicate a modest brightening of the Northern Hemi-\nsphere auroral oval during the main interval but offer no ev-\nidence of substorm activity. LANL geosynchronous parti-\ncle data (Belian et al., 1992) (also not shown) provide evi-\ndence of a slight enhancement in energetic electron flux over\nthe whole interval, but not of impulsive injection signatures\nwhich would also be indicative of substorm activity.\n4 Discussion\nIt is clear, both from the observations discussed above and\nfrom the results of the previous studies mentioned in the In-\ntroduction, that the nightside ionosphere and geomagnetic\ntail during intervals of northward IMF are often anything but\nquiescent. However, with such a wealth of phenomena re-\nported and the relationships between many of them as yet\nunclarified, no overall picture has emerged of the behaviour\nof the tail and conjugate ionosphere under these conditions.\nThe data presented above clearly demonstrate that the night-\nside high-latitude ionospheric flows reported by Grocott et\nal. (2003) for northward IMF with BY -negative also occur\nduring corresponding intervals with BY -positive. The data\nalso show that the direction of the flows is governed by the\norientation of BY , implying that the tail dynamics responsi-\nble for driving them are also directly related to the nature of\nthe IMF.\n4.1 Origin of the flow bursts\nA possible mechanism by which the flow bursts are produced\nis illustrated schematically in Fig. 8, which shows a view\nlooking down on the northern polar ionosphere, with noon to\nthe top and dusk to the left. The open-closed field line bound-\nary is shown as a dashed line, with the BY -positive Dungey-\ncycle twin convection vortices shown as the solid arrowed\ncurves, black for the Northern Hemisphere and grey for the\nexpected simultaneous flow in the Southern Hemisphere. As\nthe diagram is schematic, it may not reflect the details on the\nless-well observed dayside. Nonetheless, dayside reconnec-\ntion between terrestrial field lines and the BY -positive IMF\ncreates open flux tubes which are pulled towards dawn in the\nNorthern Hemisphere and dusk in the Southern Hemisphere.\nAs these flux tubes are dragged over the polar caps they pro-\nduce an asymmetry in the tail in which the lobes are twisted\nA.

A schematic rep-\nresentation of tail field lines is given by the numbered ar-\nrowed lines in Fig. 8. 1 (1\u2019) is a newly reconnected field\nline from the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. Owing to the\nBY -asymmetry, the northern footprint of the field line is dis-\nplaced considerably westward of the southern footprint, and\nhas a much longer path in the ionosphere back to the day-\nside. As the field line untwists itself (through positions 2 and\n3) its Northern Hemisphere footprint moves faster to catch up\nwith its southern counterpart, which results in a burst of flow\nacross the midnight sector of the nightside ionosphere (thick\nblack arrowed curve). An opposite tail lobe asymmetry and\nhence opposite direction of flow burst would therefore be ex-\npected for the opposite sense of IMF BY .\n4.2 Comparison with BY -negative\nThe schematic representation of flow bursts presented above\nexplains the fundamental difference between the bursts dis-\ncussed in this paper and those reported by Grocott et\nal. (2003), in that the direction of the flow is determined by\nthe prevailing sense of IMF BY . However, there are other dif-\nferences between the two phenomena which are not so eas-\n12\n00\n18 06\nFigure 8\n1 1'\n3\n2\nFig. 8.

The open-\nclosed field line boundary is shown as a dashed line, with the BY -\npositive Dungey-cycle twin convection vortices shown as the solid\narrowed curves, black for the Northern Hemisphere and grey for the\nsimultaneous flow in the Southern Hemisphere.

Only by comparing these\nbursts to those in the BY -negative scenario does it become\nclear that this is not the case. The BY -negative bursts were\naccompanied by northward deflections in the ground mag-\nnetic field and Grocott et al. (2003) showed these to be in re-\ngions of low conductivity where the flow velocity was high.\n1762 A. Grocott et al.: The influence of IMF By on nightside ionospheric flow\nIndeed, it was also found in the present study (as discussed\nin Sect. 3.3, above) that only those magnetometers located\ninside the high speed flow region measured significant mag-\nnetic perturbations. This, along with the lack of any signif-\nicant substorm-like enhancement in auroral emissions, sug-\ngests that the magnetic signatures associated with the flow\nbursts are driven primarily by changes in the electric field,\nrather than by enhanced conductivities. During substorm ex-\npansions it is always an enhanced westward electrojet which\nis observed, irrespective of the sense of IMF BY , and this is\nusually in a region of conductivity-induced flow suppression\n(e.g. Kirkwood et al., 1988; Morelli et al., 1995; Yeoman\net al., 2000). It is likely, therefore, that the flow bursts ob-\nserved for the BY -positive case are in effect the same phe-\nnomenon as the BY -negative bursts and resemble substorms\nmore simply because they are associated with a current sys-\ntem which has the same orientation. They are, however, an\nimportant part of the \u201csubstorm\u201d story in the larger sense of\npresumably relating to impulsive tail reconnection. A more\ncomprehensive study of a larger number of both BY -positive\nand negative intervals should more fully elucidate their rela-\ntionship both to substorms and to the nature of the upstream\nIMF.\n5 Summary\nThis paper has further addressed the issue of nightside\nflow bursts which occur during intervals of northward but\nstrongly BY -influenced IMF, discussed previously by Senior\net al. (2002) and Grocott et al. (2003). The main interval\nstudied here (01:00\u201312:00 UT on 20 March 2002) is one in\nwhich the IMF had a significant positive BY component, in\ncontrast to the BY -negative intervals mentioned above. It is\nfound that flow bursts of a similar size and speed to those ob-\nserved when BY is negative (\u223c1000 m s\u22121, spanning 2\u20133 h of\nMLT) also occur when BY is positive. However, their direc-\ntion is reversed, indicating that they are driven by processes\nin the magnetosphere which are directly related to the orien-\ntation of the IMF. It is suggested that they could be caused by\na reconfiguration of an asymmetric tail, resulting from pro-\nlonged dayside reconnection with a BY -dominated IMF. This\nis consistent with previous suggestions that they are associ-\nated with convective transport following reconnection in the\ntail. Analysis of ground magnetic data, auroral images and\ngeosynchronous particle data also show associated features,\nbut indicate that the flow bursts are not directly associated\nwith substorms. Ongoing work will address the range of IMF\nclock angles over which they occur, and further elucidate the\nrelationship between the nature of the IMF and consequent\nmagnetospheric dynamics.\nAcknowledgements.
