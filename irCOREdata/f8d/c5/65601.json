The coupling metaphor has the potential to \ntransform our views on organizational development, since coupling \u2013 and the related concept \nof systems closure - can help us to conceptualise the processes involved in organizational \nchange and adaptation.  We apply the key ideas of inter-, intra- and extra-organizational \ncoupling to a case study of a French Compagnonnage, Les Compagnons du Devoir (CdD).  \nWe use the metaphor of loose and tight coupling to explain organizational stability in the case \nan antique labour organization which can trace its history back to the fifteenth century.  We \nuse these conceptual tools to illustrate how, given certain coupling mechanisms, linked with \norganizational closure, organizations can persist in an almost unchanged state, while the \nworld around them evolves. We analyse the theoretical issues using the case of the CdD at a \ntime when it was contemplating internationalization by enlarging its activities beyond France, \nand into Great Britain. \n \n                                                 \n1 The authors appreciate the helpful comments and support of the Associate Editor Professor Michael Pratt, three \nanonymous reviewers, and participants at the Academy of Management Annual Meeting 2007 on prior versions \nof this article. \n \n* I\u00c9SEG School of Management, Catholic University of Lille, France. \n** University of Durham, UK. \n \n3 \nThe paper opens with a brief literature review of the coupled system in organization theory.  \nWe draw attention to the restrictive nature of the use of a coupling metaphor to date, stressing \nthe need to understand the dynamics of coupled systems and coupling as a continuum rather \nthan as a discrete category, and looking at tight, as much as at loose couplings.  The article \nthen proceeds to a case study of the CdD in which we outline our methodology and findings.  \nWe analyse it as a highly institutionalised system displaying variable couplings, and facing \nsignificant changes in its socio-cultural environment and institutional grounding.  This \nanalytical framework permits a better understanding of the dynamic of organizational systems \nand thus of problems of change and stability in organizations. \n \nSYSTEMS COUPLING IN ORGANIZATION THEORY \n \nWe conceive of the CdD as an evolving social system.  A social system comprises elements \nand links between those elements.  These elements can be heterogeneous; that is, they have \ndifferent characteristics in terms of the resources they exchange with the overall system.  The \nlinks between the elements create interdependencies between them, and also between the \noverall system and its environment.  A social system then is one whose elements are actors \n(individuals or groups) and whose links are frequently non-tangible (information, sentiment, \ninstitutionalised practices.)  A further characteristic of a social system is that its actors try to \nmark off their activities inside the system from those outside in an attempt to reduce \nuncertainty (Luhmann, 2001).  Using the ideas of d\u2019Iribane (1994) and Kallinkos (2003) on \norganizational culture and the relation of the individual to work, we try to understand the \nrelationship between the different organizational elements that make up the CdD, and the \nrelation of the CdD with its larger socio-cultural environment.  \n \n4 \nThe idea of coupling, both between and within organizations, first gained popularity in \nresearch on educational institutions (Weick, 1976; March and Olsen, 1976) and was later \nextended to systems theory within organization studies (Orton and Weick, 1990).  However, \nthe focus in literature has so far been almost exclusively on loosely coupled systems.  Weick \n(1976) suggests a non-teleological stand in organizational analysis by pointing out that often, \nit is a pattern of couplings that produces an outcome.  Further, there is an interrelation of \ncoupling where change in, and of, a coupling impacts other couplings (Weick, 1976). .  \n \nAccording to Orton and Weick (1990), the coupling perspective encourages researchers \nsimultaneously to consider the interdependence and indeterminacy in the interaction of \norganizational elements.  In their study on couplings in the construction industry, and basing \nthemselves on Orton and Weick (1990), Dubois and Gadde (2002) note that that \u201cloose \ncoupling may occur in a number of dimensions: among individuals, among subunits, among \norganizations, between hierarchical levels, between organizations and environments, among \nideas, between activities, and between intentions and actions\u201d (p.623).  They also observe that \nit is the pattern of loose and tight couplings that define an organization\u2019s means of coping \nwith uncertainty.  In their study on organization structure from a loose coupling perspective, \nBeekun and Glick (2002) aim to understand relational patterns in an organization along the \ncategories of its elements, four key dimensions (strength, directness, consistency, \ndependence), two co-ordinating mechanism (differentiation, integration) and domain.  \n \nSpender and Grevesen (1999) consider a multinational corporation as a loosely coupled \nsystem, and they provide an interesting juxtaposition of local responsiveness and global \nintegration, with high global integration being a proxy for tight internal coupling.  In common \nwith other authors, they propose that loose coupling from the environment can help a firm \n5 \nbuffer itself from immediate and sometimes haphazard changes in that environment.  On the \nother hand loose coupling can create blockages against interventions in local decision making, \nand the diffusion of knowledge (Weick, 1976; Dubois and Gadde, 2002).  Loose coupling can \nbe considered a form of organizational slack (Staber and Sydow, 2002), an advantage in \nhypercompetitive environments. \n \nExtending The Coupling Metaphor \n \nLoose coupling is presented as an organization\u2019s way to deal with uncertainty stemming from \nunpredictability and interdependence (Beekun and Glick, 2002; Dubois and Gadde, 2002; \nWeick, 1976).  It therefore follows from this that when coupling and system closure occur in \nintense forms they can act together to seal off the organization from its environment thus \nreducing or avoiding uncertainty altogether.   \n \nLoose coupling is \u201ca situation in which elements are responsive, but retain evidence of \nseparateness and identity\u201d (Weick, 1976).  We wish to go beyond the notion of \u201csituation\u201d \nand the almost exclusive consideration of loose couplings only.  The coupling metaphor has \nmostly been used statically, to describe and analyse organizations in snapshots.  We hope to \nshow that extending the coupling metaphor to include intra- and extra-organizational \ncouplings; and variable degrees of couplings, can shed light on the organizational dynamics of \nadaptation and resistance to the environment.  We use the coupling metaphor in an extended \nway.  We propose to examine the development of an organizational system by observing both \nintra- and extra-organizational couplings; the relationship between coupling and relative \nsystem closure; and both loose and tight couplings. \n \n6 \nIn order to understand a system in a holistic way attention must be paid to links - and \ntherefore couplings - at all levels.  A useful way to identify key couplings is to use the \ndistinction between \u201cactor bonds\u201d, \u201cresource ties\u201d, and \u201cactivity links\u201d proposed by \nH\u00e5kansson and Snehota (1995), who introduce these categories as the \u201cthree substantive \nlayers of a relationship\u201d.  Activity links between partners are those of a technical, commercial, \nor administrative nature.  They can be sequential or parallel; and they create, and serve to \nmanage, interdependencies between partners.  Resource ties can be tangible or intangible; \nthey can be acquired, accessed, or combined.  They create interdependencies between \npartners, which constrain and shape opportunities for interaction.  Lastly, actor bonds refer to \npersonal relationships, both formal and informal.  They influence the individual actors\u2019 \ninterpretations of other actors\u2019 behaviour and identities, and thus how and the extent to which \nactivity links and resource ties are built and possibly formalised.   \n \nEach of these layers \u2013 a bond, tie, or link - can be characterised by the degree of coupling it \ninvolves.  For example, actor bonds can be tight (involving close cooperation and a high \ndegree of responsiveness between two or more people), or rather loose.  An example for tight \ncoupling in terms of resource ties would be a Just In Time regime.  Distinguishing between \ndifferent types of links helps us to comprehend and classify the variety of connections \nbetween organizational elements.  Later we will show a classification of these layers in the \ncase of the CdD.  \n \nCOUPLING AND SYSTEMS CLOSURE \n \nThe focus of this study is the internal and external couplings of a system, and their links with \nsystems closure.  We define \u2018systems closure\u2019 to mean the extent to which an organization is \ncoupled with its external environment.  The degree of closure of a social system affects, for \nexample, membership criteria, or the extent to which the functioning of the overall system \ndepends on the state of the environment.  Closed systems are loosely coupled with the \nenvironment; open systems display tighter coupling with the environment.  Table 1 illustrates \nsome examples of the relationship between systems closure and intra-organizational coupling \n7 \nby combining Thompson\u2019s (1967) notion of open and closed systems with Orton and Weick\u2019s \n(1990) discussion of the coupling metaphor. \n \nTAKE IN TABLE 1 \u2018EXAMPLES OF SYSTEM CLOSURE AND INTRA-\nORGANIZATIONAL COUPLING\u2019 HERE \n \nAn example of a system that is tightly coupled with its external environment (i.e. open) and at \nthe same time loosely coupled internally is a large state university with its different faculties \nand departments.  Another example is the multilateral alliances currently developing between \nairlines where autonomous but increasingly interdependent organizations establish \nfederations.  \n \nOn the other hand an army as an institution with its troops, material, staff and rules, \nconstitutes a closed and tightly coupled system.  An organizational element of an army such \nas a battalion may have within it sub-elements tightly coupled to each other in the form of \ninterdependencies between individual soldiers, and between soldiers and their equipment.  \nYet they remain an open system in that they are very dependent on, and must be responsive \nto, changes that come about from the external environment.  Another sub-organization of the \nmilitary is that of individual elite forces (e.g. paratroopers) who are dropped behind enemy \nlines and operate individually or in small groups.  They are a closed system in that their type \nof activity requires loose coupling from the environment, while they must also be able to \noperate individually and independently.  Similar features can be found with the Jesuits and \nother religious missionaries.  One aspect of closed but loosely coupled systems is that in many \ncases loose internal coupling is permissible because of systems closure.  We will show later \nhow these patterns can also be found in our case study, and how the CdD case is an example \n8 \nfor different combinations of degree of closure and degree of coupling permitting social \nsystems to face different types of change.  Going beyond the present case, Table 1 gives \nexamples of organizations that are largely successful, and suggests that this is in part so \nbecause their closure\/coupling configuration is adequate to the task at hand.  In terms of \norganizational survival, this leads to the question of responsiveness (and \/or vulnerability) to \nchange. We will discuss how different coupling\/closure configurations can be advantageous \nfor certain organizations facing different types of change.  \n \nA CASE STUDY OF A SPECIFIC SYSTEM: THE CDD \n \nIn this section, we first outline our methodology, and then proceed to present a case study of \nthe CdD as a social system, paying attention to the links which bind its elements together; and \nconnect it to the wider environment.  We draw attention to the historical development of the \nCdD, its philosophy, its objectives, life inside its Housed, and its links with the outside world.  \nWe apply H\u00e5kansson and Snehota\u2019s (1995) three-layer classification of relationships to \nanalyse the theoretical issues and to show how the case study illuminates them. \n \nBACKGROUND TO THE RESEARCH \n \nThe authors were members of the Le Conseil Scientifique de l\u2019International Journeyman \nProgramme.  The International Journeyman Programme (IJP) was a project to offer high-\nskills training in construction and engineering to young people from the north of England by \npassing them through the CdD.  The IJP was supervised by the IJP Project Steering Group \nthat represented small local businesses, Gateshead Borough Council (GBC), a local authority, \nand the Department of Trade and Industry.  Le Conseil Scientifique advised the IJP Steering \n9 \nGroup on present and future policies.  In this capacity the authors had access to the main \nparticipants in the UK and in France, including managers and trainers in factories in France, \nand the UK apprentices passing through the system.  The role adopted by the authors in the \nproject was one of academic researchers rather than participant or action researchers. \n \nInitially a study of the CdD from the perspective of systems coupling and closure was not the \nmain aim of neither Le Conseil Scientifique, or of the IJP.  Rather it was the relevance and \napplicability of the high-skill vocational and educational training (VET) in the north-east of \nEngland.  At first the IJP assumed that British youngsters could be exported and processed \nthrough the CdD system of vocational training.  Therefore the problems initially focused on \nrecruiting and selecting young British apprentices and sending them for training with the CdD \nin France.  This involved liaising with the British labour market agencies to find a suitable \npool of recruits, developing methods of selection, designing induction procedures for \nsuccessful applicants, designing a \u2018taster\u2019 placement programme of three-weeks\u2019 duration in \nwhich successful applicants could experience life in a French factory and in the CdD.  Five of \nthe British apprentices were then selected as Apprentis2, to live and work in France.   \n \nAfter two years it became apparent that the export model did not work and could not be made \nto do so.  For fuller appreciation of the reasons for the failure of this strategy see Malloch and \nRedman (2005).  At this point the IJP considered whether the CdD system could be imported \nat all into the UK.  When discussing the possible reasons for the IJP\u2019s failure, and the long-\nterm survival of the CdD in general, the authors found that they increasingly used the \ncoupling metaphor and references to systems closure in their conversations.  It was at this \n                                                 \n2 An Apprenti is a young person in the initial stage of their apprenticeship.. \n10 \npoint that the work on the present paper began, and that issues of organizational coupling and \nclosure moved centre stage.   \n \nRESEARCH STRATEGY \n \nThis study aims to gain an understanding of the dynamics of highly institutionalised social \nsystems. It accommodates research methods such as direct observation, informal \nconversations, participant observation, open-ended and semi-structured interviews, and the \nsupporting written documents.  \n \nThe research strategy employed was one of inductive theory building (see for example Martin \nand Turner, 1986; Burrell and Morgan, 1979; Daft and Buenger, 1991; Das, 1983; Eisenhardt, \n1989; Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Isabella, 1990; Locke, 2001; Pettigrew, 1990).  Data were \ncollected in parallel with the study of theoretical concepts; we tried continuously to formulate \nwhat we saw in the language of theory.  From this, the metaphors of coupling and systems \nclosure emerged as a basis for discussing the phenomenon at hand.   \n \nThe method of grounded theory building is particularly well suited to the study of a dynamic \nsystem in that:  \n \nThe naturalistically oriented data collection methods as well as the [grounded theory] \napproach\u2019s theory-building orientation permit the investigation and theoretical \ndevelopment of new substantive areas as they \u2018arrive\u2019 on the organizational scene. \n(Locke, 2001: 96). \n11 \nOur research fits the description of Lee (1999) in that it occurs in a natural setting; the data \nderive from the participants\u2019 perspective; it calls for a flexible research approach, and at times \nit runs \u201ccounter to the prevailing notions of control, reliability, and validity\u201d (p.163.)  Our \nwork is theory based in that \"a theory-based study takes phenomena apart and tells the story \nabout the intervening variables and processes that explain what is happening in the \norganization\" (Daft and Buenger, 1991).  We worked in cycles; iterating between existing \nconceptual language and what we saw: generating explanations (Lynham, 2000), continuously \nlinking and adjusting the concepts we found in the literature to the case at hand.  Possibly the \nbest description of our approach can be found in Bourgeois (1979): we first worked \ninductively from our empirical base, and, in a second step, worked deductively by extending \nexisting theory.  \n \nIn our opinion the coupling metaphor can be extended to encompass two important concepts \nand one key distinction.  The concepts are the notion of variable degrees of coupling; and the \nintroduction of a conceptual link between coupling and systems closure.  The key distinction \nis between different types of change.  We have two complementary aims.  First, to build a \nconceptual link between existing writings on social systems; we draw on Orton and Weick\u2019s \n(1990) conceptualisations of the coupling metaphor and link these to H\u00e5kansson and \nSnehota\u2019s (1995) distinction between different types of links in a relationship.  Second, we \naim to elaborate on existing theories on coupling and institutional dynamics.  These concepts \nand ideas emerged by talking about what we saw and using the concepts we found in \nliterature.  This led to an almost natural process of extending concepts and linking with \nexisting literature.  Indeed, we believe that one important function of academic writing \u2013 \ngoing much beyond hypothesis testing- is that of the elaboration of a conceptual language that \nhelps us see, and describe what we see. \n12 \n RESEARCH METHOD AND DESIGN \n \nWe held interviews with five managers of the CdD working full-time for that organization.  \nThese were two Pr\u00e9v\u00f4ts3 responsible for managing Houses; two Pr\u00e9v\u00f4ts responsible for \nmanaging the CdD\u2019s activities in the UK, and the CdD manager responsible for developing \ntheir international relations.  The last three served with us on the IJP Steering Group.  They \ngave us insights into the structure, history, functioning and traditions of the CdD necessary to \nconstruct an overall view of this unique institution.  We did not record these interviews as we \nconsidered it would inhibit the data gathering process, but we did make detailed notes.  \nFurther we were dealing with an organization which was closed, tightly coupled internally, \nand which relied upon normative controls.  This seems to us to explain why much of the \ninformation gathered through formal interviews with those connected with the CdD was \nreliable, without necessarily being valid; that is, the data they provided were consistent \nwithout necessarily being wholly comprehensive.  In the IJP data gathering did not fall neatly \ninto pre-fixed categories such as \u2018interviewing\u2019 and we gained much valuable information in \ndiscussions held with respondents day-to-day interactions e.g.in committees, meetings and \nduring site visits.  \n \nWe further held interviews with the five representatives of UK organizations on the Conseil \nScientifique.  These represented potential employers in the public and private sectors, and \nstate agencies.  They all had an interest in making the high-skill training offered by the CdD \navailable to British youngsters.  These semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed \nand coded.  We also held four interviews with trainers and mangers in French factories in \n                                                 \n3 A Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t is a Compagnon who works as a manager for the CdD. \n13 \nLille, Toulouse and Lyons who employed youngsters in training with the CdD.  Three of \nthese were not Compagnons; one was.  Again we did not record these interviews but we did \ntake detailed notes of these encounters. \n \nIn-depth interviews were held with the five UK Apprentis who were offered full-time \npermanent employment as apprentices in France and who lived and worked in the CdD for at \nleast six months.  The interviews were semi-structured and focused on the apprentices\u2019 life in \nthe Compagnonnage.  They were recorded; the tapes were transcribed and then coded for \nitems and themes of interest.  The UK apprentices were aged 18-20 and their academic \nachievements were modest.  Two came straight from full-time study, the other four had \nworked and passed through some type of training scheme in engineering, and two had worked \nfor Japanese firms.  Thus they were well placed to compare their experiences in the \nCompagnons with that on offer in the UK.  It is appreciated that these are small numbers, but \nthey do represent the all the UK apprentices.  All were interviewed on at least two occasions. \n \nDebriefings conducted by means of Nominal Group Technique (Delbecq and Van de Ven, \n1971) with three cohorts of UK youngsters who completed all or part of the initial three-week \nprogramme of life in the House whilst working in French factories.  The size of these groups \nvaried between 8-12 participants.  These sessions were recorded, transcribed and analysed for \nrelevant points.  In all 70 interviews were conducted with 60 different participants.  The \nsources of information for this research are listed on the Table below \n \nTAKE IN TABLE 2 \u2018RESEARCH DATA SOURCES AND TYPES OF DATA OBTAINED\u2019 \nHERE \n14 \n A CASE STUDY OF THE CDD \n \nThe CdD offers high-skill VET (vocational education and training) to about 8,500 young \npeople in 23 trades in engineering, construction, baking, clothing and confectionery through a \nnetwork of 50 Houses, each a residential college incorporating classrooms, workshops and \nliving accommodation.  By day the young Apprentis and Aspirants4 work in local factories, \neach evening and weekend they return to the House to study.  Each House is recognised by \nthe French authorities as being a Centre de Formation d\u2019Apprentis (CFA) or approved \ntraining centre.  Apart from its antiquity, the CdD has other interesting features, notably that it \nis one of the largest private providers of high-skill VET in Europe; and the CdD and the \nFreemasons are the only two non-religious initiation-based organizations in Europe (Gu\u00e9non, \n2004). \n \nThe CdD represents a work ethic described in d\u2019Iribarne (1994) as Montesquieu\u2019s \u201cThe \nHonour Principle\u201d.  Iribarne conducted his research on \u201cpatterns of action\u201d in large French \nbureaucracies comparing his observations on everyday French organizational life and \nworkers\u2019 attitude with factories in other countries (p.82).  The Honour Principle is a \nspecifically French phenomenon, characterised by a high degree of formal flexibility and an \nimprecise division of accountabilities and responsibilities on the one hand, and \u201cdedicated \nfulfilment of obligations that traditionally fall to the particular occupational category to which \neach individual belongs\u201d (p.85) on the other: \u201cMany expressions such as \u2018doing one\u2019s job\u2019, \n\u2018doing one\u2019s work properly\u2019, [\u2026], reflected this form of the sense of duty.\u201d (ibid.).  The \n                                                 \n4 An Aspirant is a trainee who has successfully completed the first stage (Apprenti) of his training. \n15 \nHonour Principle is thus reflecting a value- and status-based worker rationale, rather than a \npurpose-based one. \n \nAn organization\u2019s current structure partly reflects the epoch in which the industry was \nfounded (Mintzberg, 1979; Stinchcombe, 1965); therefore we need to understand the origins \nof the Compagnonnages5.  Their history is unclear but they emerged as a force in the \nseventeenth century from amongst the work organizations of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, such as the \nguilds, religious orders, and the confraternities.  The Compagnonnages borrowed from them \nall, combining their features into a rich blend of religious symbolism, rituals, ideas of honour, \nlanguage, fraternity, hierarchy, definitions of skill, and division of labour (Truant, 1994, \npp.48-72). \n \nThe Compagnon was a craftsman who worked outside of the guilds.  Although they had \nfeatures in common with contemporary work organizations, they differed in one crucial \nrespect: they refused to admit employers.  The Compagnonnages defended worker interests \nagainst rapacious employers, provided training schools, managed the network of Houses, \ndirected apprentices through the Tour of France necessary to complete their professional \ntraining, and supported needy members.  The absence of any employer participation and \ndirect contact with a \u2018product\u2019 permitted the evolution of a central strand of the CdD\u2019s \nphilosophy, which can be seen today.  We heard it many times during our dealings with the \nCdD but one of the Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t responsible for the CdD\u2019s operations in the UK stated it most \nclearly to us. \n \n                                                 \n5Compagnonnage is both a singular and collective noun.  Historically there were numerous; today only three \nexist.  To avoid confusion we use the term Compagnonnage to denote the CdD; and Compagnonnages to refer to \nthem collectively. \n16 \nThe Compagnons is not like a firm.  We do it for the idea of people growing up with \nus, of taking up the trade and keeping it alive. \u2026 The first thing you have to do as a \nfirm is to sell, to make money.  We don\u2019t have to make anything.  Every Compagnon \ngives a bit of himself. \n \nKieser (1989) argues that the evolution of modern formal organizations from the medieval \nguilds required three evolutionary steps.  The first was the separation of individual motives \nfrom individual goals.  Like today\u2019s worker co-operatives which try to make their \norganizational goals and practices match their members\u2019 needs and value systems, medieval \nwork organizations deployed normative power and elicited moral involvement from their \nmembers (Etzioni, 1961).  Modern work organizations achieve stability by replacing \nnormative power with remunerative power, and utilitarian rather than moral involvement.  \nThe workers work for the money, accepting a growing split between their personal interests \nand those of their employer for cash.  This gives the employer flexibility to accommodate the \nchanges required by a changing environment.  This was a necessary step for the emergence of \nnew organizational forms, better equipped to serve the needs of the market place.   \n \nThe Compagnonnage never adopted these new organizational forms.  In their world there \nwere no employers, the profit motive was not legitimised and they conceived of themselves \nneither as factors of production, nor as consumers.  This world-view was installed at their \nbirth and it still relevant.  As Mintzberg puts it, \u201cindustries develop because of the technical \nand economic conditions of their time.  As long as these conditions do not change for them \nthere is no reason to expect them to change their structures.\u201d (1979, p.229, our italics).  The \nCdD is a pre-modern organization with medieval roots.  A key step in ensuring that conditions \ndo not change for them is to construct their organization as a closed system.  Its sheer \n17 \nlongevity suggests that it has been remarkably successful in doing this.  Today there are about \n25,000 trainees and trainers in the three French Compagnonnages, of which the CdD is the \nlargest.  That three survive in France alone suggests that the French environment has some \nunique features which have helped to sustain them.  We will discuss this further below. \n \nTo become a Compagnon is to become a \u2018new man\u2019; to symbolise this all Compagnons adopt \nnew names as they progress through the CdD.  The three dimensions of \u2018new man\u2019 can be \ndefined as: savoir-faire, or task related skills; savoir, or theoretical knowledge; and savoir-\n\u00eatre, to know how to be (Delamare Le Diest and Winterton, 2005).  By savoir-\u00eatre we mean \nthe social skills essential to be a fully functioning and integrated member of the work group, \nfamily, firm, organization and society at large.  It is this focus on savoir-\u00eatre that is \ndistinctive.  Personal renewal and transformation are central to this process.  This is \nsymbolised by the choice of trades (m\u00e9tiers).  All work done by Compagnons involves skilled \nhand-work to change natural materials into finished products.  The production line, and \nadministrative and professional work have no place in the Compagnonnage (Hautin and \nBillier, 2000; pp.51-56).  Man, material, tools, the acquisition of skill, and personal \ndevelopment are all linked for the Compagnon.  Trist and Bamforth\u2019s (1951) study of UK \ncoal-mining using a socio-technical systems perspective illustrates how technical change \nuncouples tightly-linked meaning systems in traditional work processes.  One outcome of this \nphilosophy has been to focus the activities of the Compagnons in occupational niches \nrelatively untouched by Taylorism, massification and international competition. \n \nThe creation of the new man revolves around the notions of le m\u00e9tier and le devoir.  Le m\u00e9tier \ngives work a central life interest and a moral and social focus.  It is an activity that involves \npassing on knowledge and skills to other workers, helping other workers, preserving the \n18 \nhistory of the craft and striving for better technical standards.  One Compagnon expressed it \nin this way. \n \nWe don\u2019t talk about \u201cjobs\u201d or \u201ccareers\u201d.  To us this sort of language is offensive.  If \nyou only \u201cwork\u201d then what you are doing is a bind or something trivial.  \u2026  Go and \ntalk to someone who is unemployed and then come back and tell me that work is \ntrivial and unimportant to him.  (A Compagnon mason, quoted in Gu\u00e9dez (1994, \np.35)) \n \nLe devoir means \u201cduty\u201d, \u201cwork\u201d and \u201ccraft\u201d; for the Compagnon they are linked ideas, \ndefining both the Compagnonnage and the Compagnons as individuals, professionals and \ncitizens.  Le devoir and le m\u00e9tier were encountered many times during our meetings with \nCompagnons and non-Compagnons alike.  For many of the UK Apprentis passing through \nthe Houses and factories in France it was the most noticeable aspect of French working life.  \nThe positive attitude of the French worker was consistently rated as one of the two most \nstriking feature of French factory life by the students participating in the \u2018taster\u2019 course.  One \ncommented during a Nominal Group Feedback session: \nIt is different in France.  They are mechanical engineers and metal-workers; that\u2019s \nwhat they want to do and that\u2019s what they are.  They say \u201cI love my job, I love getting \nup in the morning\u201d; it\u2019s just like a hobby for them, they don\u2019t do it for the money.  \nIt\u2019s strange; it\u2019s weird when you first go there.  \nLe devoir was a central and shared concept of early modern French society (Truant, 1994, \np.60), it can be regarded as a powerful expression of the Honour Principle.  This is a sense of \nduty emanating from membership of a certain caste that can find expression both in the \n19 \nworkplace and in citizenship at large.  They have important consequences for definitions of \n\u201cjob\u201d, \u201ccareer\u201d, \u201cskill\u201d and \u201cmotivation\u201d.  For d\u2019Iribane (1994) the Honour Principle shows \nitself in ideals such as \u201clover of the craft\u201d, \u201cskill\u201d, and \u201cnobility of work\u201d (p.90).  d\u2019Iribane \nfinds support for this in Crozier\u2019s (1963) reporting of his interviews with employees in French \npublic sector organizations.   \n \nLife inside the House. \n \nThe CdD has three grades of member: Apprenti, Aspirant and Compagnon.  Apprentis enter at \n16 for a training that lasts up to three years.  On successful completion of their training they \ncan become an Aspirant, and undertake the Tour de France; this is a period of work, study \nand training in different parts of France or other countries, with different employers.  Thus the \nAspirant is exposed to different tools, materials, systems of work organization and customers.  \nOn the Tour the Aspirants stay in a House near their place of work.  Progression to a higher \ngrade of membership depends upon certification of competence as savoir-faire and savoir-\n\u00eatre through assessments controlled by the CdD.  Aspirants graduate to full Compagnon status \nafter which they may serve the CdD for a further three years in some administrative capacity \nas a Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t, or as a Ma\u00eetre responsible for the training of Apprentis or Aspirants.  Afterwards \nmost leave the House and live in the local community as S\u00e9dentaires, when they retire they \nare known as Anciens.  Both Anciens and S\u00e9dentaires continue to maintain their links with a \nHouse in their locality. \n \nEvery Compagnon has a responsibility to help the younger members. Young Apprentis share \nrooms with older members.  Compagnons are closely tied together by a complex and \ninterlocking set of horizontal social links.  Youngsters enter as Apprentis and work their way \n20 \nto Compagnons by passing tests of savoir, savoir-faire and savoir-\u00eatre controlled by the CdD \nthemselves.  These are the sole criteria for progression.  No credit is given to applicants \nbecause they are, for example, employers, or have undergone some other type of training.  On \ncompletion of his training the Compagnon undergoes secret initiation rites.  In these he \nsymbolically rejects his natural family, adopts his fellow Compagnons as brothers, and takes a \nCompagnanique surname.  For the duration of these rites the House is called La M\u00e9re \n(mother).  Successful completion of these rites is marked by the awarding of canes, ribbons \nand colours.  Members of the CdD were unwilling to talk to us directly about these initiation \nrites, or why they were secret, but one Compagnon interviewed by Gu\u00e9rez explained that the \nrites evoked a profound emotion of initiation and belonging, something that could only be felt \nand not talked about (1994, p.97). \n \nAn important part of le devoir was an obligation on members of the House to help each other.  \nTraining was not limited to trade skills; it also included savoir-\u00eatre.  One UK Apprenti \ndescribed dinners, semi-formal occasions accompanied by dress codes and rituals: \n \nIf you don\u2019t follow the dress code one of the Compagnons will ask you to leave and \nchange.  \u2026  They are really strict with that.  People are asked to leave dining room \nif they don\u2019t have collars they get particularly annoyed if it happens a second time.  \nThey believe that it is something they have been doing all the years; it\u2019s something \nthat they expect should be done and has to be done.  That\u2019s what you are there for \u2013 \nto be a Compagnon and to live that life and you have to respect the way of life they \nfollow.   \n \n21 \nThe Ma\u00eetre de Stage and Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t played important parts in training and their influence was \nsupported by a CdD strategy of appointing to these posts Compagnons who were only two or \nthree years older than the Apprentis.  These \u2018near-peers\u2019 presented themselves as positive \nrole-models with whom Apprentis and Aspirants could form intense personal relationships \n(Herzog and Herzog, 1998, p.6).  S\u00e9dentaires and Anciens had roles to play in the \ndevelopment of young Compagnons. Each Apprenti and Aspirant was given an Ancien or a \nS\u00e9dentaire to guide him through the trade tests necessary for adoption to higher levels of the \nCdD; the S\u00e9dentaires and Anciens sponsored their charges for adoption; and they invited \ntheir learners to their homes.  They would come to the workshops at night and weekends to \noffer help and guidance, give talks to their trade on the history of the CdD and participate in \nthe performance review of the young learners. \n \nThe Apprentis and Aspirant were bound to the CdD by economics and close supervision.  \nYoung learners had little diposable income; the resultant poverty cemented social bonds.  \nApprentis were dependent upon the financially more secure Aspirants to help fund their social \nactivities.  Direct supervision was important.  The UK Apprentis all commented on how they \nwould be asked to account for themselves if found outside a class during scheduled work \nperiods.   One commented: \n \nThere are always people on your back \u2013 but not in a bad way.  For example they will \nwant to know if you arrive late.  You can\u2019t take a night off; if you do your Ma\u00eetre de \nStage will want to know why.  They pick up on everything.  It makes you think \nbefore you decide to take a night off because you cannot be bothered going to class.  \nIt makes you think that you have to learn. \n \n22 \nThese constraints meant that for many life revolved the House: emotional bonding, close \nsupervision, financial ties, the acceptance of the House and its residents as family, the \nHouse as both a place of residence and study.  These were the links that tied the \nCompagnons to each other and which made them the Compagnonnage. \n \nThe CdD and the outside world. \n \nLinks with outside world were less developed.  All training, both managerial and technical \nwas conducted in-house, and virtually all managerial appointments were internal.  Of the four \ntrainers and workshop managers interviewed who employed Apprentis and Aspirants only one \nwas a Compagnon, but all respected the CdD for the high standard of the training.  Pascal, a \nMa\u00eetre de Stage in an engineering repair establishment in Lyon described the training as \n\u2018thorough and exhaustive\u2019, likening it to a Rolls-Royce car.  Jean-Philippe, the head of a large \nengineering sub-contractor in Toulouse who employed CdD learners said \u201cthey have a love of \nwork, a taste for it, a need to work; they never give up \u2026 they take pride in their craft and in \nbelonging to the CdD.\u201d \n \nWhile the non-Compagnons recognised the quality of the trainees, they had little idea of how \nthey were produced.  Jean-Philippe remarked that \u201cthere is a culture behind all this, but I have \nno idea how they pass it on.\u201d  Pascal confused the CdD with the Freemasons throughout his \ntalks with us.  He commented on the lack of personal contact with the CdD, remarking that he \nhad only had one meeting lasting 20 minutes with the Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t of the House which supplied his \nApprentis, a meeting which took place on his factory premises and not in the House.  \nOtherwise communications between firms and the world of the Compagnons in the House \nwere limited to the carnet de progr\u00e8s, a record of the Apprenti\u2019s completion of workplace-\n23 \nrelated training.  Non-Compagnons could also consult the Encyclopaedia, a guide to tools and \ntechniques used by the different m\u00e9tiers, written and published by the CdD \n \nDivisions between the Compagnonnage and outsiders could be seen in the language used by \nthe non-Compagnons to describe the CdD.  These included terms such as \u201cclan\u201d, \u201ccult\u201d, \n\u201cinsiders and outsiders\u201d, \u201cthe logic of belonging\u201d, and \u201cmonastic\u201d.  Frequent reference was \nmade to the \u201cesoteric practices\u201d (rites and rituals) of the Compagnons.  Non-Compagnons \nperceived themselves as being regarded by the Compagnons as \u2018profane\u2019.  One respondent \ncomplained that, \u201cthe Prev\u00f4ts never talk openly\u201d.  The situation was summed up by one of the \nUK Apprentis when we asked him to describe what being a Compagnon meant to him: \n \nYou can\u2019t really describe what the Compagnons are about to people who don\u2019t know \nabout them.  The impression even here in France is the Compagnons are some kind of \nsect. \u2013 like you are branded when you enter \u2026 that you do secret handshakes behind \nclosed doors.   \n \nThis apparent inability to manage communications with the world outside the House was of \nlittle concern to the Compagnons.  Indeed, many saw it as asset.  One Prev\u00f4t said: \n \n[t]his closure permits the long-term survival of the of the CdD.  From our closure we \ndraw our inner strength and focus our thinking.  Our time here is very private.  Even \nthe youngsters who leave us never talk in detail about their time spent amongst us. \u2026 \nand no Compagnon ever puts the fact that he is a Compagnon on his CV. \n \n24 \nACTIVITY LINKS, RESOURCE TIES AND ACTOR BONDS IN THE CDD \n \nUsing the interpretive lenses of activity links, resource ties and actor bonds we can now \nsummarise illustrate the way systems elements in the CdD are tightly or loosely coupled.  \nThese are shown on Table 3 Tight and Loose Coupling in the CdD.  This Table draws on \nmaterial previously presented. \n \nTAKE IN TABLE 3 TIGHT AND LOOSE COUPLING IN THE CDD HERE \n \nWe note three features of the loose linkages.  First, they are highly codified and explicit.  \nSecond, they are weak. Both stem from the fact that the workplace belongs to another \ninstitution, one rooted not in le devoir or le m\u00e9tier, but in the uncertain world of French \nindustry, peopled with actors who were not of the same Compagnons clan (Ouchi and Price, \n1978) who neither shared the ideology of the CdD, nor would they submit to the CdD\u2019s \nimplicit, informal controls.  These problematic linkages with the workplace legitimised two \nkey features of the CdD as a system.  First, they encouraged the use of formal and explicit \nliaison devices between the CdD and the workplace.  Second, they created a need for the other \nparts of the CdD system to be loosely coupled with the workplace; for the CdD to continue to \nmaintain its notion of le m\u00e9tier it could not afford to be too responsive to the ever-changing \nneeds of the French workplace, its owners and customers.   \n \nLastly, devices such as the carnet de progr\u00e8s serve as physical buffers between the CdD and \nthe outside world.  A case can be made for them in terms of administrative efficiency, but \norganizationally they helped to encapsulate the world of the CdD from that of the workplace. \n \n25 \nBy contrast links from the House to other parts of the CdD system were strong and implicit. \nWe can evidence this with reference to the Tour de France, and the role of the House in the \nformation of Compagnons.  The Tour de France did much more than train Aspirants; it was a \nbuttress maintaining the CdD system, and the House in particular.  The migratory status of the \nAspirant meant that they pumped knowledge around the CdD system.  Without them, Houses \nwould only hold only Apprentis and their mentors.  Aspirants were importers of new ideas, \nspreading innovations from other geographic locales.  This knowledge transfer was implicit \nand non-codified.   \n \nThe House had an important role to play in the education, development and training of \nApprentis and Aspirants.  The training embraced highly formalised, functional, skill-specific \nlearning as well as informal learning of a cross-functional nature, which came from different \ntrades living together.  The skills imparted were not merely those of the trade; the demands of \nle devoir and le m\u00e9tier imposed a much wider curriculum for the learner.  Life in the House \nembraced behaviour codes imparted by the older members to the younger ones.  Learning \nembraced savoir, savoir-faire and savoir-\u00eatre, all of which were required in equal measure to \ntrain the whole, cultured man.  The Houses, both individually and as a network, formed \ncomprehensive community of practice (Wenger, 1998) which permeated and controlled most \naspects of the learners\u2019 lives. \n \nThe Compagnon\u2019s assessment procedure links were explicit and implicit, codified and non-\ncodified.  For example, whilst the assessments of savoir and savoir-faire were relatively \nexplicit and codified, learners also had to satisfy the other members of the House that they \nwould be good Aspirants or Compagnons, a process which was very tacit and non-codified.  \nThe coupling in these links was very tight.  Further evidence can be seen in the panopticon-\n26 \nlike nature of the work and study regimes demanded of the young learners, and the financially \nhandcuffing of younger members, both to the House to their seniors. \n \nThe Houses are a separate sub-system.  Although an integral part of the CdD system they \nwere independent in the sense that individual Houses could be opened and closed without \ndamage to the rest of the system.  The loosely coupled nature of the individual House \nprovided a valuable buffer against some important environmental shifts.  One UK Apprenti \ndescribed how his employer had been taken over; the new owners had strategies of \nmassification and task simplification resulting in a reduction of the skilled work essential for \nhis personal development. He had raised the matter with his Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t and Ma\u00eetre de Stage and \nthey found him a new job in a different House. \n \nThe CdD is an identity transforming institution (Greil and Rudy, 1984) in which identities are \nremade.  The Houses are the factories in which these social operations took place.  To manage \nthis process the technical and administrative activity links within the CdD are very strong.  On \nthe other hand external activity links are all weak.  The CdD has virtually no links of \ncommercial nature with the external world.  Their focus is not on any type of commercial \nexchange relationship, be it the wage-work bargain, or the product market.  Internal resource \nties are very strong. Most of the resource flows concern knowledge.  The passing on of social \nand technical knowledge is indeed one of the institutionalised pillars of the CdD, its raison \nd\u2019\u00eatre.  On the external side, there are some resource dependencies with local companies for \nwork placements for Apprentis, or the need to raise money through the French taxe \nd\u2019apprentissage system. \n \n27 \nActor bonds in the CdD system are extremely strong; they are familial, highly \ninstitutionalised, and life-long.  The initiation rites are a key part of their formation.  In these \nthe would-be Compagnon takes a new family, accepting unrelated men as his fictive brothers \n(Truant, 1994, p.13), the CdD offers them a surrogate mother in the form of the House (\u201cla \nm\u00e9re\u201d or  \u201cla m\u00e9re maison\u201d).  By contrast actor bonds with the environment are sparse and \nsporadic, to be activated as and when needed; an example would be a Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u2019s personal \nnetwork of acquaintances with the owners of local firms. \n \nCertain aspects of this constellation of linkages, ties and bonds, both loosely and tightly \ncoupled help us understand why this organization has endured over seven centuries and why \nthe CdD cannot be simply dismissed as an eccentric anachronism of French economic history.  \nWe can consider its linkages, ties and bonds and its system of coupling as its resource base, \ncertain aspects of which have provided the CdD with a sustainable durability.  At one level \nthe purpose of the CdD is to train the skilled man, with skill being widely defined as savoir-\nfaire, savoir-\u00eatre and savoir.  It does this by means of the House, which can be seen both as a \nset of resource ties and as the locus of key activity links.  In the case of the House both of \nthese are tangible.  Yet le devoir and le m\u00e9tier are equally important to the process of training \nthe skilled man.  In fact the House without these key elements is useless, rather like a factory \nwithout power.  Le devoir and le m\u00e9tier are intangible resource ties which sustain the House.  \nAll three elements, le devoir, le m\u00e9tier and the House, form a social system whose output is \nthe skilled man.  This system is represented in Figure 1 \u2018Skill as a Social System in the CdD\u2019 \nbelow \n \nTAKE IN FIGURE 1 \u2018SKILL AS A SOCIAL SYSTEM IN THE CDD\u2019 HERE \n \n28 \nOf course le devoir and le m\u00e9tier are not only resource ties; they are also actor bonds \nenergising mutual help and transmitting of the idea of the skilled man from generation to \ngeneration.  The House is the locale in which all three \u2013 resource ties, activity links and actor \nbonds \u2013 become manifest.  This system of internal couplings is a key strategic competence \nand le devoir, le m\u00e9tier and the House are the resource and asset base which sustain it.  To \nconceive of the CdD as an organization only for training technically-competent workers is to \nfail to grasp its true significance and such a limited perception cannot fully explain its \ndurability, of why it has survived for 700 years, centuries which have witnessed huge shifts in \ntechnologies, products, markets and raw materials.  The CdD is not principally in that \nbusiness.  It makes new men rather than masons or carpenters and neither the product \nspecification, nor the competences and resources required, nor the technology necessary for \nthis task have changed over the centuries.  In part this is why it has survived \u2013 and why also \nthere may be problems in transplanting it to a different cultural soil.  \n \nINTERNATIONALIZATION : A DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE \n \nThe internationalization of the CdD provides a good lens through which many of the \nproblems of organizational adaptation can be observed.  The CdD was partially \ninternationalized with a few non-French members in its Houses; and a handful of Houses \nabroad.  From 2002 the pace of internationalization quickened.  Following the failure of the \n\u2018export\u2019 policy of the IJP, the idea emerged of establishing a network of CdD Houses in the \nUK.  It was recognised that there would be many difficulties, but all crystallised into one \nmeta-problem: would it be possible to transplant an essentially ancient French institution to \nthe UK?   \n29 \n To answer this question we must understand the CdD as a dynamic system.  Its history and \nstrong institutional roots of the CdD make it a relatively closed system.  Internationalization \nrepresents an environmental change different from past changes, and against which tight \ncoupling and relative closure alone cannot protect it.  We call this \u2018the erosion of the \ninstitutional mother soil\u2019 - the result of globalization.  We consider that in addition to relative \nclosure and tight coupling, a search for a new institutional grounding will be necessary; and \nthat possibly this grounding and legitimation for further existence can be found in institutions \nacting as a countervailing force to the powerful trend of globalisation.  \n \nWith respect to internationalization, the CdD continues to exist successfully.  The relative \nclosure of the system buffers it against environmental shifts; its longevity is due to its closure \nand not its responsiveness to environmental change.  Two seminal writings on the cultural \nembeddedness of work attitudes are those of d'Iribane (1994) and Kallinikos (2003).  They \nadvance two views on workers\u2019 attitudes toward their occupations, and whether or not there \nexists a link between occupational identity and the individual\u2019s larger sense of citizenship. \n \nD\u2019Iribarne bases his discussion of the French work ethic on a concept of honour already \ndescribed by Montesquieu (1748), one deeply entrenched in French society and which leads \nthe individual to consider himself to be honour-bound to certain behaviour according to his \n\u201cestate\u201d, or socio-professional class.  He argues there is change in what practice or action is \nconsidered to be \u201cnoble\u201d or \u201cright\u201d at a particular time, but what is permanent is the concept \nof honour as the basis for action and self-identity of the individual.   \n \n30 \nBy contrast Kallinikos (2003) juxtaposes what he considers to be mainly a characteristic of a \nhistorical socio-cultural framework, where an individual\u2019s public and private roles constituted \na harmonious whole and where a worker was \u201ca solid individual capable of constantly \nassimilating and accumulating the lessons of a long-lasting occupational journey\u201d (p.600) \nwith that in a post-modern socio-cultural context, where \u201cmodern humans are involved in \norganizations qua roles, rather than qua persons\u201d (p.595). \n \nIt is the variance in couplings between system elements, and the closure of the whole that \nbuttress the CdD in France.  Yet when the CdD moves abroad then the buttress becomes a \nmillstone tied around its institutional neck as it attempts to swim in the seas of globalization.  \nWhat makes the system integrated and coherent is a tacit meta-institution - the Honour \nPrinciple.  It could be argued that extreme tacitness can be the guarantor of survival, against \nthe odds, of an institution and of its extraordinary strength.  It is, however, immobile and \nhighly dependent on a certain external institutional context. \n \nBy establishing Houses in other countries it is possible to export organizational elements such \nas hierarchy, house rules, practices and procedures.  However, the pivotal point of the CdD is \na principle that is so deeply embedded in French culture.  It is impossible to export the \norganizational equivalent of its DNA.  To use a horticultural analogy, exporting a House can \nbe likened to grafting.  In the first generation after the establishment of a House abroad, we \ncan still expect a very strong pheno-typical resemblance to CdD institutions in France, and \neven a survival of the Honour Principle, nurtured by the French Compagnons serving in the \nHouse abroad.  Yet in the long term, the blueprint for further development \u2013 and the options \nfor mutations \u2013 will be different.  The graft will always be qualitatively different from the \ntrunk, which depends so strongly on its embeddedness in the soil of French culture.  The \n31 \nHonour Principle survives change because stakeholders accept that change can only be \ninduced on the basis of an existing commonly-held meta\u2013principle (Crozier, 1963; d'Iribane, \n1994).  Thus, in the French context, what is considered to be \u2018noble\u2019 does change over time, \nbut according to d\u2019Iribane the concept of \u201chonour as base of nobility\u201d does not. (pp.92-3). \n \nAs it was the attempt at internationalisation in the UK failed.  GBC were much attracted to the \nidea of working with the CdD, but as a UK public sector organization GBC were legally \nobliged to deal with the CdD as \u2018suppliers\u2019.  Any relationship had to be based on a legal \ncontract for economic services awarded by a process of competitive tendering.  As a first step \nin the process of establishing the CdD in the UK, GBC wanted to employ some Compagnons \non restoration projects, renovating old buildings and public monuments.  Because no firm in \nthe UK employed Compagnons in the required trades, it was hoped that the CdD would tender \ndirectly for some contracts.  However the CdD had to decline to participate in the tendering \nprocess, pointing out that they did not employ any workers, neither did they make anything.  \nIn other words their coupling with this particular segment of their external environment was \nvery weak, even non-existent.  The graft could not be even brought to the plant. \n \nTWO TYPES OF CHANGE \n \nWhile the CdD has attempted to shield itself from change, it does face two challenges in this \nregard. The first challenge is the temporal change described by d\u2019Iribarne (1994) where the \nunderlying meta-principle remains constant.  This we call \u2018induced change\u2019.  Here the \ninitiators of the change come mostly from within, and act as countervailing forces.  Examples \nabound in history, such as the French Revolution or various worker movements in the 1800s \nin Europe.  Even if they are not from within, they act in a clear relation to the system that is to \n32 \nchange.  One example could be the USA trying to induce cultural changes in Afghanistan.   \nHere \u2018change\u2019 implies the direct replacement of one thing with another. \n \nThe changes facing the CdD and other organizations are another type of change.  We call this \n\u2018change by erosion\u2019.  It is made of impulses for change emanating not just from interest \ngroups that come from within the same cultural sphere, or directly within it.  Rather it is a \nconstant bombardment of exogenously generated ideas, concepts and institutions, many of \nwhich are contradictory.  This is one of the key impacts of globalization: individuals, groups, \norganizations, societies are permanently bombarded by signals, most of which are not initially \naimed at them, but rather let loose haphazardly in an increasingly interconnected and \ninterdependent network of global information. \n \nIt is important to stress that diffuse change is not a \u2018change\u2019 in the voluntarist sense of the \nword, but rather an erosion.  Erosion means that institutions and ideas disappear without an \nintended replacement.  Instead of replacement, there are multiple choices without institutional \nguidance.  To further clarify this distinction, Table 4 compares some features of induced \nchange with those of change by erosion. These concepts were derived inductively when \nworking around Iribarne\u2019s (1994) notions of temporal (induced) change, because we found \nthat some of the forces of change acting upon the CdD \u2013 such as globalisation and the \nproliferation of fragmented institutions - cannot be explained by induced change alone.  \n \nTAKE IN TABLE 4 INDUCED CHANGE AND CHANGE BY EROSION HERE \n \nThis conceptual distinction is useful since d\u2019Iribarne\u2019s (1994) explanation for the survival of \nthe anachronistic Honour Principle can be used to explain partially the CdD\u2019s survival to date: \n33 \nThe Honour Principle is grounded, according to d\u2019Iribarne (1992:92) in the importance which \nFrench culture has traditionally given to the \u201cdistinction between what is noble and what is \ncommon\u201d.  This notion (d\u2019Iribarne also refers to it as an \u201caristocracy of talents\u201d) has persisted \nin France since medieval times, and is tied to the importance which the French tend to attach \nto standing in society, and the resulting strong status stratification (in contrast to, say, \nGermany or the Anglo-Saxon world). \n \nYet this is not an argument for its future survival.  The contemporary global phenomenon of \nmassive institutional erosion threatens the cultural soil which sustains it.  Its future lies not in \nthe mainstream of existing cultures and institutions, but possibly as part of a countervailing \nculture.  In other words, the CdD as an institution will shift from a distilled, concentrated \nexpression of a prevailing institution to being an expression of an institutional fragment, one \nof many in an institutionally fragmented world.  Its grounding and self-understanding might \ntransform its representation of French excellence to that of being a countervailing force, a \nsystem that resists the drift of the underlying meta-principle towards one of fragmentation and \nrelativism. \n \nThis drift will imply a change in the configuration of closure and coupling in the CdD.  A \nsocial system that has to buffer itself against change by erosion needs to be loosely coupled \nfrom the external environment; that is, it needs to be relatively closed.  Activity links, \nresource ties and actor bonds with the external world should be sparse, and only exist to \nsatisfy clear resource dependencies (H\u00e5kansson and Snehota, 1995).  It is here that Pfeffer and \nSalancik\u2019s (1978) discussion of resource dependencies as a \u201ctrade-off between autonomy and \nsurvival\u201d becomes very plastic.  It is also here that we can see a link between couplings that \nare external and internal: one way to maintain loose coupling with the external world is to \n34 \nmaintain tight couplings internally, especially in terms of activity links and actor bonds: these \nare the types of links that help maintain institutions, rules, shared understandings, \nconceptualisations and sense making patterns alive.  Table 5 \u2018Coupling, Closure and Types of \nChange\u2019 attempts to illustrate how these two types of change could be met by differently \ncoupled systems. \n \nTAKE IN TABLE 5 \u2018COUPLING, CLOSURE AND TYPES OF CHANGE\u2019 HERE \n \nTable 5 does not take into account couplings at different levels, or variable couplings.  \nHowever, we feel that it illustrates the variety of a system\u2019s reaction, and possible adaptation \nto, the two types of change.  It should be clear that the coupling structure of a system is highly \ncontingent on its need to respond to (or buffer from) the two types of change.  We suggest \nthat to some extent, an organization\u2019s success can be explained in terms of in how far they \nmanaged to adapt their internal and external couplings to the type of change they need to \neither resist, or adapt to, in order to survive. There is a potential for future research here. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nWe have tried to extend the discussion on the dynamics of organizations as social systems by \nproposing a conceptual framework which can help us to shed light on organisational change \nand survival. We highlight three main points.  First, it is important to extend the use of the \nloose coupling metaphor to include other types of couplings.  Second, we examine the type of \nelements that are coupled. Elements can be both tangible and institutional. We use the \ncategories of activity links, resource ties and actor bonds that were proposed by H\u00e5kansson \nand Snehota (1995).   \n35 \nAs evidenced in Table 4, the pattern that appears from matching different links to the degree \nof coupling depicts an organisation that is tightly coupled within, and loosely coupled \nwithout. This has implications for our third point, where we suggest that in examining the \ndynamic component of organisational coupling, it is important to distinguish between two \ntypes of change, which we call \u201cinduced change\u201d and \u201cerosion\u201d, respectively. We argue that \nthe CdD is currently facing change by erosion, in other words, an erosion of the institutional \nenvironment in which it has been grounded. As an organisation that is tightly coupled within, \nand loosely coupled without, the CdD has so far managed to buffer itself from the erosions of \na changing institutional environment. This has been largely possible due to its grounding in \nthe tacit meta-institution of \u201cLe Principe d\u2019Honneur\u201d, a particularly French attitude to work \nwell done. Indeed, it appears that in order to be successful, coupling configurations of an \norganisation must take into account the larger institutional and socio-cultural context. \n \nUsing the internationalisation of the CdD as an example for change, we have suggested that \nafter \u2018grafting\u2019 the cutting of an organization structure onto a different socio-cultural trunk \nrooted in a foreign soil, the graft will, at the beginning bear pheno typical resemblance to the \nparent, but in the long run the tree will develop quite differently because the institutional \n\u2018mother soil\u2019 is different.  We conclude by indicating that these phenomena of change through \nerosion are not unique to internationalization, but can also be found any type of institutional \nchange that is characteristic of a post-modern world, a world where change will come by \nincreasingly by erosion. \n \nWe hope that conceptual vocabulary used in this paper - the combination of coupling  and \norganisational closure, and the distinction between two types of change- might  help \n36 \nunderstand the adaptation and survival of organisational forms, practices and institutions to \ndifferently changing environments.  \n \nBibliography \n \nBEEKUN, R. & GLICK, W.
