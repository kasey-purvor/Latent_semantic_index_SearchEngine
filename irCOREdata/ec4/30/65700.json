This paper looks at whether this shift is substantial through an \nexamination of Cameron and William Hague\u201fs foreign policy pronouncements. Its \nparticular focus is to discuss whether the Henry Jackson Society, a group of \nacademics, parliamentarians and journalists, is exercising any influence over \nConservative Party foreign policy discussion. Finally, we consider how critics \nincluding individuals associated with the Henry Jackson Society have evaluated \nCameron and Hague\u201fs tentative interventionist convictions. It is suggested that \nthe notion that idealism in foreign policy has to be conditioned by realism is \nactually a re-working of Blair\u201fs foreign policy especially when applied to overseas \nintervention. \n \n \nWith the confirmation of Gordon Brown as the new British Prime Minister in June \n2007, we now face the prospect of an election sometime sooner than May 2010. \nWithin days of taking office, Brown has had to confront an attempted car \nbombing of Glasgow Airport by suspected Islamic militants alongside further \nBritish military losses in Afghanistan and Iraq. While journalists have noted that \nBrown\u201fs approach to security questions (especially in the immediate aftermath of \nthe Glasgow incident) and the \u201eWar on Terror\u201f is different in tone and substance \ncompared to his predecessor, the new Prime Minister has also been swift to \nreinforce the importance of the Anglo-American \u201especial relationship\u201f.1 In the \n 2 \naftermath of his first Camp David meeting with George Bush in July 2007, he \ntravelled to the United Nations in order to secure an Anglo-French resolution \nauthorising the dispatch of a substantial UN peace keeping force to Darfur. As he \nnoted:  \n \nFor today is an important decision day for Darfur - and for change. \nThe situation in Darfur is the greatest humanitarian disaster the world \nfaces today.  Over 200,000 dead, 2 million displaced and 4 million on food \naid. Following my meeting with President Bush, and I thank him for his \nleadership on Darfur, the UK and the French have now, with US support, \nagreed and tabled a UN Security Council resolution that will mandate the \ndeployment of the worlds largest peacekeeping operation to protect the \ncitizens of Darfur.  And I hope this plan - for a 19,000 African Union-UN \nforce - will be adopted later today.  Immediately we will work hard to \ndeploy this force quickly. And the plan for Darfur from now on is to \nachieve a ceasefire, including an end to aerial bombings of civilians; drive \nforward peace talks starting in Arusha Tanzania this weekend on 3rd \nAugust; and as peace is established, offer to and begin to invest in \nrecovery and reconstruction. But we must be clear if any party blocks \nprogress and the killings continue, I and others will redouble our efforts to \nimpose further sanctions.2 \n \nHis UN speech went on to explore in some detail the need for further effort to be \nexpended not merely on the situation in Sudan but also to consider yet again \nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals. On both sides of the \nAtlantic, Brown\u201fs speech drew complimentary analysis.3 \n \nFor the Conservative leadership under David Cameron, Brown\u201fs forays into \nforeign policy provide precious little comfort. There is renewed pressure on the \nLeader of the Opposition to mobilise substantive domestic and foreign policies in \n 3 \nthe light of evidence that Brown\u201fs standing in the opinion polls remains high and \neven above the symbolically significant 40% level. Worryingly for those hoping \nthat the Conservatives can  prevent a fourth electoral victory for the Labour \nParty, they are not as strong as the current government in areas where they \nhave traditionally commanded a strong lead such as defence and foreign affairs. \nIt now seems a long time ago that Labour were ridiculed and satirised for their \ndefence and security policies in the 1980s especially in the field of unilateral \nnuclear disarmament. Since September 11th 2001, the Labour government under \nBlair and now Brown have not lost ground to the Conservatives in this policy \narea, despite the unpopularity of the 2003 Iraqi invasion. \n \nWhile domestic policy changes and uncertainty have led to caricatures of \nCameron\u201fs political opportunism, his views on foreign policy have been much \nmore collaborative with Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague. The question \nposed in this paper is how the Conservative Party are developing distinct new \nareas of foreign policy debate. We consider some of the arguments and \nsuggestions put forward by senior party figures such as Cameron and Hague. \nThis has shown that the Conservative Party is at least beginning to discuss these \nideas, contrary to a Guardian leader about a year after Cameron\u201fs election which \nasked \u201cDoes the Conservative party have a foreign policy? If it does, what is it? \nNo one seems certain\u201d.4  \n \nOne specific area where there has been some shift in Conservative Party thinking \nhas been in the specific area of humanitarian or military intervention in third \nparty conflicts. The Shadow Foreign Secretary, William Hague, has been at the \nvanguard of this policy reformulation. Traditionally, the political right has been \nhesitant to intervene in such conflicts without an explicit British benefit. The \nMajor administration (1992-1997) provided one example of Conservative \ngovernment r hesitance in the midst of the Bosnian conflict. It was only when \nthe Clinton administration committed itself to find a political solution that \n 4 \nEuropean powers including the British, joined efforts to secure a settlement in \n1995. Yet since September 11th 2001 the Conservative party has not presented a \nradically different interpretation of world events to Labour, with the then \nConservative leader Michael Howard supporting the 2003 invasion of Iraq. While \nmore recently the Conservatives have broken the largely bipartisan approach of \nthe two main British parties concerning Iraq, this has been around detail, \nhindsight and political positioning rather than any fundamental ideological \ndivision. \n \nIndeed, in the only foreign policy comment in his conference speech pitching for \nthe leadership, Cameron made the following remark \n \nAnd when we talk about foreign affairs, we don't just stand up for \nGibraltar and Zimbabwe but for the people of Darfur and sub-Saharan \nAfrica who are living on less than a dollar a day and getting poorer while \nwe're getting richer.5 \n \nHague, in contrast to previous Conservative policy, but close to Blair, has \nsimilarly been forthright in championing the question of rights, notably \nsuggesting that William Wilberforce and the abolition of slavery was a first \ninstance of humanitarian intervention.6 It is this question that is the focus of this \npiece. In his Conservative Party conference speech of October 2006, Hague \npresented this new approach to third party conflicts:  \n \nA few months ago, in the refugee camps of Darfur, I met people whose \nhomes had been torched, relatives killed and families driven from their \nland. Looking into their frightened, vulnerable eyes reminded me more of \nany statistic or chart ever could, that policies is about much more than \nwhat we do here at home\u2026 In our approach to foreign policy we will \nnever forgot [sic] that there are people in Burma and Darfur who have to \n 5 \nfight for their lives, and indeed under other despotic and vile regimes such  \nas that of Zimbabwe\u2026 Foreign affairs may be our greatest of all \nchallenges for the next government of this country. And our mission in \npreparing for government is simply stated: to understand the world we \nwill be dealing with, and to do so with humility and patience\u2026Our foreign \npolicy, as David Cameron set out on September 11th [2006] will be that of \nliberal conservatives, supportive of spreading freedom and humanitarian \nintervention, but recognising the complexities of human nature and \nsceptical of grand schemes to remake the world.7   \n \nThis search for a \u201enew direction\u201f is still evolving and in a speech to Chatham \nHouse in January 2007, Hague reiterated his belief that:  \n \nAll governments find that idealism in foreign policy has to be tempered \nwith realism but it is important to remember that a world based on any \nother set of values will be without the means for the tolerance and \nacceptance of diversity which is of such critical importance in a globalized \nage.8  \n \nThe notion that idealism in foreign policy has to be conditioned by realism is \nperhaps a replaying of the Blair\u201fs foreign policy position, which attempted to \nnegotiate the tensions of political realism with moral idealism. This problem, \nespecially when combined with his highly personalised \u201especial relationship\u201f with \nthe George W. Bush , were was cruelly exposed in the \u201eYo Blair\u201f moment, when it \nwas only too apparent that Prime Ministerial influence on American foreign policy \nwas limited at best.9  In combination with Blair\u201fs reluctance to criticise the Israeli \nbombing of Lebanon in the summer of 2006, this allowed Hague in particular to \nshift Conservative Party thinking towards a nascent form of liberal neo-\nconservatism, which continues to debated within various policy commissions \nestablished in the aftermath of Cameron\u201fs leadership success. This intellectual \n 6 \ntransformation, however incomplete, continues against a backdrop of a Brown \nadministration.  \n \nIn the following sections of this paper, we exploreurther recent Conservative \nParty thinking on foreign policy. Our focus is particularly on interventionism, \nrather than Europe or relations with China or Russia. In the next section, we \nconsider the Henry Jackson Society, which has attracted a variety of signatories \nincluding senior members of the Conservative Party. Given the Society\u201fs \ndetermination to shape foreign policy debates in Britain, we pose the question as \nto whether this group of individuals and their associated manifestos have \ninfluenced ongoing Conservative Party debates about foreign policy and Britain\u201fs \nrole in the world. Thereafter we consider why British neo-conservatives have \nexpressed their support for Cameron\u201fs policy machinations and assess evolving \ndiscussions about the new foreign policy. \n \nCameron and the Henry Jackson Society \n \nIn an unguarded moment in an interview Cameron suggested that the non-\nConservative Prime Minister he most admired might well have been \nPalmerston.10 Given Palmerston\u201fs robust foreign policy, often characterized as \n\u201egun-boat diplomacy\u201f, this is revealing. More concrete indications come from a \nlook at Cameron\u201fs principal advisors. During his election campaign, three figures \nstood out: Michael Gove (Conservative MP and former leader writer for The \nTimes), Ed Vaizey (Conservative MP and member of Cameron\u201fs campaign team) \nand George Osborne. Osborne is the shadow Chancellor, who hailed the \n\u201cexcellent neoconservative case\u201d for action against Iraq11  and stressed that he is \na \u201csigned-up, card-carrying Bush fan\u201d.12 We find something similar in former \nConservative leader Michael Howard\u201fs views of the Iraq war, an even starker and \nstronger case than Blair. He would have gone to war even if he had known there \nwere no \u201eweapons of mass destruction\u201f, and even if the case for war was \u201cnot \n 7 \nclear-cut\u201d. Had it been clearly illegal he would not have launched war, but he \nnoted in May 2005 that \u201cas the attorney general himself recognised in the \nopinion that we were at last allowed to see last week, it is possible to hold \ndifferent views on the legality of questions like that. International law is not \nprecise. There is room for more than one opinion. If I had honestly held the \nopinion that it was legal to go to war, I would have taken the same action but I \nwould have told the truth about it and I would have had a plan\u201d.13 Osborne\u201fs \ndetailed foreign policy views, with the exception of obvious indications \nconcerning Europe, are as yet relatively unknown. But Vaizey and Gove are \nexplicit in their allegiances, both being signatories of the Henry Jackson Society\u201fs \n\u201cStatement of Principles\u201d. What does this society aim for? \n \nThe Henry Jackson Society is a non-profit and non-partisan organisation \nthat seeks to promote the following principles: that liberal democracy \nshould be spread across the world; that as the world\u201fs most powerful \ndemocracies, the United States and the European Union \u2013 under British \nleadership \u2013 must shape the world more actively by intervention and \nexample; that such leadership requires political will, a commitment to \nuniversal human rights and the maintenance of a strong military with \nglobal expeditionary reach; and that too few of our leaders in Britain and \nthe rest of Europe today are ready to play a role in the world that \nmatches our strength and responsibilities.14 \n \nThis, they suggest, can be understood under the heading of \u201ca principled policy \nof democratic realism\u201d. This is a telling phrase, one taken from American \nneoconservative Charles Krauthammer, yet it is one he sees as an explicitly \n\u201cAmerican Foreign Policy for a Unipolar World\u201d,15 whereas for the Henry Jackson \nSociety this is \u201ethe British Moment\u201f.16 Krauthammer suggests that the means of \ninternationalism and legalism should be \u201cin service to a larger vision: remaking \nthe international system in the image of domestic society\u201d.17 This is intended to \n 8 \n\u201ctranscend power politics, narrow national interest, and, ultimately, the nation-\nstate itself\u2026 they welcome the decline of sovereignty as the road to the new \nglobalism of a norm-driven, legally bound international system broken to the \nmode of domestic society\u201d.18 \n \nBefore we move to their \u201eStatement of Principles\u201f it is worth dwelling for a \nmoment on who Henry \u201eScoop\u201f Jackson was. Again, though they assert a British \nidentity, their namesake was a prominent US politician. Jackson was a \nDemocratic senator and failed presidential candidate in 1976 who advocated a \nforeign policy of strength and \u201emoral clarity\u201f, resisted d\u00e9tente with the Soviets \n(and was very critical of their restrictions on Jewish emigration) alongside  \nsupporting the war in Vietnam.19 He sought a progressive New Deal politics at \nhome and a strongly anti-communist policy abroad, sometimes known as Cold \nWar liberalism. In 1974, for instance, he argued that future US-Soviet relations \nshould be tied to the human rights record of the Soviets and that American \nadministrations should not be reluctant to use military and economic levers to \nchange the internal behaviour of other states including superpowers. Famously, \nJackson clashed with Henry Kissinger over d\u00e9tente and the Ford administration \nactually stopped using the term in 1975.20  \n \nThough a Democrat he was widely respected by Republicans and thus serves as \nan emblematic figure of a bi-partisan foreign policy. As some commentators have \nnoted, the roots of neoconservatism are mostly on the \u201eleft\u201f of US politics, \ndisillusioned with a perceived unwillingness to defend liberal values and confront \ntotalitarianism.21 As Murray notes, Paul Wolfowitz himself prefers the label of \n\u201cScoop Jackson Republican\u201d to neoconservative.22 Jackson\u201fs name is given to \nseveral organizations in the US, such as The Henry M. Jackson Foundation for \nthe Advancement of Military Medicine;23 the Henry M. Jackson Foundation which \nprovides research grants;24 and the Henry M. Jackson School of International \nStudies at the University of Washington.25 For the British Henry Jackson Society \n 9 \nhe was an opponent of \u201cunprincipled accommodation, which abandoned the \nwider cause of human rights and compromised security\u201d.26 \n \nThe Society\u201fs \u201eStatement of Principles\u201f, dated 11th March 2005, just under two \nyears since the invasion of Iraq, advocates a \u201crobust foreign policy\u2026 based on \nclear universal principles\u201d.27 These include \u201cthe global promotion of the rule of \nlaw, liberal democracy, civil rights, environmental responsibility and the market \neconomy\u201d. They claim that a belief in \u201cstrength and human rights\u201d, owing much \nto Jackson, \u201chastened the collapse of the Soviet dictatorship\u201d. Yet like many \nother commentators they suggest that the benefits of the victory in the Cold War \nwere squandered through complacency. The Clinton administration (1993-2001), \naccording to this view, deserves considerable opprobrium for failing  through  its \nmilitary and economic power to change the behaviour of others; Bosnia was a \nkey failure, as was policy in Yugoslavia more generally; while Kosovo and Sierra \nLeone \u201calthough imperfect, provide an appropriate model for future action\u201d. This \nfuture action need not always be through military action, as the actions and \nsuccesses of EU and NATO expansion demonstrate. Thus the Society calls \u201cfor an \nassertive and active role for Britain on the world stage\u201d,28 suggesting that \ncontrary to suggestions that Britain has attempted to punch above its weight, \ntraditionally, under realist conservatism, \u201cBritain actually punches below its \nweight\u201d.29 Tying humanitarian intervention to the project of the Bush \nadministration, they suggest that Blair\u201fs premiership, for them, was a \u201csea \nchange in foreign policy\u201d.30 Kamm suggests that \u201eneoconservative\u201f can be \u201can \naccurate description of a progressive political stance, and of Blair\u201fs foreign \npolicies in particular\u201d;31 and Murray suggests that Blair was \u201calmost perfectly \nneoconservative on foreign policy\u201d.32 As noted above, the ideals of liberal \nhumanitarian intervention espoused by the likes of Blair and Kofi Annan and the \nclaims about \u201econtingent sovereignty\u201f made by prominent neoconservatives share \na very similar logic.33 \n \n 10 \nThe Society therefore proposes a number of key principles:- \n \n1. [it] believes that modern liberal democracies set an example to which \nthe rest of the world should aspire. \n2. Supports a \u201eforward strategy\u201f to assist those countries that are not yet \nliberal and democratic to become so. This would involve the full spectrum \nof our \u201ecarrot\u201f capacities, be they diplomatic, economic, cultural or \npolitical, but also, when necessary, those \u201esticks\u201f of the military domain. \n3. Supports the maintenance of a strong military, by the United States, \nthe countries of the European Union and other democratic powers, armed \nwith expeditionary capabilities with a global reach. \n4. Supports the necessary furtherance of European military modernisation \nand integration under British leadership, preferably within NATO. \n5. Stresses the importance of unity between the world\u201fs great \ndemocracies, represented by institutions such as NATO, the European \nUnion and the OECD, amongst many others. \n6. Believes that only modern liberal democratic states are truly legitimate, \nand that any international organisation which admits undemocratic states \non an equal basis is fundamentally flawed. \n7. Gives two cheers for capitalism. There are limits to the market, which \nneeds to serve the Democratic Community and should be reconciled to \nthe environment. \n8. Accepts that we have to set priorities and that sometimes we have to \ncompromise, but insists that we should never lose sight of our \nfundamental values. This means that alliances with repressive regimes can \nonly be temporary. It also means a strong commitment to individual and \ncivil liberties in democratic states, even and especially when we are under \nattack.34 \n \n 11 \nIt continues to claim that it does \u201cnot represent any specific political party or \npersuasion, but provide a forum for those who agree with these simple guiding \nprinciples, or who wish to learn more about them\u201d. It is clear from these \nprinciples that it asserts the superiority of modern liberal democracy; and that \nboth economic and military pressures can and should be used to promote this as \nthe norm of governments across the world. The \u201ecarrot\u201f being offered may simply \nbe a less obvious \u201estick\u201f; or to put it another way economic pressure can be used \nso that carrots become sticks. It offers a critique of the UN and other \nmultinational organisations that admit states that do not fit this model of \n\u201cmodern liberal democratic\u201d states, and asserts that if the EU is to operate \nmilitarily this should be within NATO. Although this is explicitly tied to British \nleadership, operating within NATO would allow a US veto; something a purely EU \nforce would not. It attempts to offer something to the left or the green \nmovement in point 7, but merely as ways of mediating the market rather than as \nalternatives. Finally it advocates an idealism tempered by realism,35 and a nod to \nlibertarians worried about the restrictions imposed in the \u201ewar on terror\u201f. \n \nSignatories of the Statement of Principles include a range of elected figures, \njournalists, academics and practitioners. Conservative MPs include Michael \nAncram, formerly Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign & Commonwealth \nAffairs, Shadow Secretary of State for Defence and Deputy Leader of the \nConservative Party; David Willetts, Shadow Secretary of State for Education and \nSkills, along with Gove and Vaizey. Gisela Stuart, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston \nand UK representative on the EU Constitution, Greg Pope and Denis MacShane, \nformerly Minister of State for Europe, are Labour MPs who have signed up.36 \nOliver Kamm and Stephen Pollard of The Times; historian and broadcaster \nAndrew Roberts; Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6; Jamie Shea of \nNATO; David Trimble and Lord Powell of Bayswater are some of the other profile \nnames. It has used its media links to publicise its aims, particularly in a piece \nmasquerading as journalism by one of those signatories.37 Also involved are \n 12 \nsome of those actively involved in the war against and occupation of Iraq, \nnotably Colonel Tim Collins and provincial governor Mark Etherington. The \nInternational Patrons are a similarly impressive array of figures, many from the \nUS. They include James Wolsey, former director of the CIA, William Kristol of The \nWeekly Standard, Robert Kagan and Richard Perle \u2013 all key figures within US \nneoconservatism. Perle was a former aide to Jackson, and Kagan is the author of \nthe influential Paradise and Power which contrasts American and European \nattitudes to the current world order.38 Irwin Stelzer, also a prominent \nneoconservative and Rupert Murdoch\u201fs man in Britain, is a signatory too. \nRevealingly he described Cameron as \u201can empty vessel waiting to be filled\u201d.39 It \nis clear that the Henry Jackson Society is intending for its ideas on foreign policy \nto be part of the contents.40  \n \nFor those that think this far-fetched, the Project for a New American Century, \nfounded in 1997 during the Clinton \u201einterregnum\u201f both provided many of the key \nfigures of the Bush administration as well as much of its policy. Indeed it is \nstriking how much of its 1997 \u201eStatement of Principles\u201f and its 2000 manifesto \nRebuilding America\u201fs Defenses reappeared in the 2002 National Security \nStrategy.41 However, as Francis Fukuyama, has recently lamented, the \nintellectual influence of neo-conservatives did not produce a set of foreign \npolicies under the Bush administration that he would now approve of.42 As he \nnoted, the Bush administration failed to predict the backlash provoked by \nAmerican hegemonic ambitions, under-estimated opposition in Iraq, over-\nestimated its capabilities to social engineer a new Iraq and wider Middle East and \nhas failed to appreciate the developmental challenges facing weak states in \nAfrica and elsewhere.43 Indeed this disillusionment of the neo-cons has been \npronounced recently, with the likes of David Frum and Richard Perle \u2013 speech \nwriter to Bush and Pentagon advisor respectively, and authors of the manifesto \nAn End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror \u2013 breaking ranks shortly before \nthe mid-term elections in late 2006.44 \n 13 \n \nAgainst Realism and Moral Relativism \n \nOne of the affiliated academics to the Henry Jackson Society is Brendan Simms, \nReader in the History of International Relations at Cambridge and author of a \nprominent critique of British policy on Bosnia.45 Simms, who is Co-President of \nthe Society, suggests that one of its aims is to \u201cshow that actually many of the \nideas considered to be neoconservative are actually ideas that come very much \nfrom within the mainstream tradition of U.S. foreign policy\u201d.46 In this, as in his \nbook on Bosnia, he is advocating a critique of traditional British conservative \nforeign policy and its predominantly realist outlook.47 Yet like the American \nmodel they hope to appeal across the political spectrum and bring in those in the \nLabour party who, like Blair, are supporters of the turn toward intervention \u2013 \nhumanitarian or for national or global security \u2013 in US foreign policy.48 As David \nClark, a former Labour adviser to Robin Cook notes, the British left \u201ccan be \nreluctant to assert the superiority of liberal democracy, thereby laying itself open \nto the charge of moral relativism\u201d.49 This is precisely one of the charges that the \nHenry Jackson Society is quick to lay at their door; just as it is similarly critical of \nthose unwilling to actively intervene to enforce that perceived superiority. \n \nThis critique is particularly apparent in a book written by Michael Gove himself, \nunder the title of Celsius 7\/7.50 The irony of a book by a neoconservative that \nboth mirrors Michael Moore\u201fs Fahrenheit 9\/11, and converts the \u201eimperial\u201f \nmessage to a European metric is seemingly lost on him. The contrasts in other \nareas, however, are extremely stark. Like the Society more generally, Gove lists \nthe failures of 1990s foreign policy on both sides of the Atlantic: in \u201cBosnia, Iraq, \nSomalia, Northern Ireland \u2013 the West has been shown to be either weak, \ntemporizing or irresolute in the face of threats\u201d.51 Similarly he has no time for \nattempts to understand the enemy in the \u201ewar on terror\u201f: \u201cthe primary moral \n 14 \nresponsibility for acts of evil \u2013 and any attempt to qualify the word is itself a \nmoral surrender \u2013 rests with the authors of that evil\u201d.52  \n \nLike many of the US neoconservatives he constructs a strong defence of Israel, \nbut this goes beyond merely the support for their actions in \u201eresponse\u201f to threats. \nGove believes Israel was legitimate in terms of its seizing of Arab territory, and \nwants to underline that this territory was not Palestinian when Israel occupied it. \nHe continues: \u201cwhat was striking about the people who lived on that territory, \nwho were thought of as Palestinian, is the way they were treated between 1948 \nand 1967 by all of Israel\u201fs neighbours\u201d.53 This for Gove is another example where \nthe West needs to recognise the Israel, as the only liberal Western democracy in \nthe region, needs support, not criticism. For him \u201cthe space for moral clarity has \nbeen squeezed out by the dominance of moral relativism\u201d.54 Therefore, he has \nno truck with those who either lament and or condemn the state of Israel for \nignoring United Nations resolutions regarding occupation of the West Bank, \nconstructing the security fence on illegally occupied land, sanctioning \nassassination of political opponents, bombing civilians, and treating Arab Israelis \nas second class citizens. Moreover, as critics would also contend, Israel \npossesses the most sophisticated conventional armed forces in the region and is \nan established nuclear weapon state.  \n \nIn terms of the war on Iraq, Gove has no time for those that sought the UN \nroute and the backing of \u201einternational law\u201f, claiming that \u201cit is remarkable that a \ndemocratic vote in the United Kingdom should not be considered truly legitimate \nunless it has been approved by a body that is, in itself, profoundly anti-\ndemocratic and that vests veto power in nations that are serial abusers of human \nrights\u201d.55 In this he mirrors the Henry Jackson Society\u201fs critique of the UN.56 In \nterms of the conduct of this war and the one in Afghanistan, he bemoans the \nway Guant\u00e1namo Bay, daisy-cutter bombs or depleted uranium shells are \ncriticized, without the \u201ctactics of our enemies\u201d being explored.57 What Gove \n 15 \nneglects, of course, is that criticizing actions in the \u201ewar on terror\u201f does not \nnecessarily excuse or exonerate any other actions. Indeed it is precisely the \nWest\u201fs claims to moral high ground that put them in a position where their \nactions are more open to scrutiny. And in the case of Israel, it is precisely \nbecause it is a democratic state that it is subject to critical scrutiny by academics \nand campaigners even if pro-Israeli lobby groups in the United States often \naccuse critics of being anti-Semitic.58 Innocents are slaughtered on all sides, and \nto recognise this in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine and Lebanon is not to diminish \nthe suffering of those who died in the twin towers, the trains of Madrid or \nLondon, or in the buses that operate in Israel. \n \nGove reserves some of his strongest criticism for those who believe that the \nWest is imposing freedom or democracy: \n \nFurthermore, I could discuss the argument that we have no right, in the \nmajesty of our Western arrogance, to \u201eimpose\u201f democracy. As if allowing \npeople to choose their ruler, and indeed their form of government, can be \nunderstood, other than by twisting the English language out of all \nrecognition, as an \u201eimposition\u201f. I could ask on what basis life under an \narbitrary, capricious and torture-addicted tyrant is morally superior to life \nunder a ruler one can choose, and choose to remove, oneself.59  \n \nYet to object to the invasion of Iraq is not to support the violent regime of \nSaddam. Again Gove neglects the way in which democratically elected regimes \nthat do not fit the West\u201fs view of acceptable are continually targeted and seen as \nillegitimate. Democracy has to mean accepting those who oppose, not merely \nthose who will be malleable. Arafat was elected, Hamas was elected, Hezbollah \nhas electoral support too as does the current President of Iran. For Gove though, \nthis would be to surrender too much to a plurality. Values are important, but only \n 16 \nthose that are shared and these must be asserted forcefully. This is something \nthat he advocates as a response to the London bombs of 7th July 2005. \n \nMore broadly, we also need to rediscover and reproclaim faith in our \ncommon values. We need an ideological effort to move away from moral \nrelativism and towards moral clarity, as well as a commitment to build a \ntruly inclusive model of British citizenship in which divisive separatist \nidentities are challenged, and rejected.60 \n \nThus integration, and integrative, rather than separate, and therefore separatist, \nidentities are needed. Trading on the ideas of the Orientalist Bernard Lewis, as \ndo many of the neoconservatives in America, Gove is clear about this.61 \n \nThe British Moment? \n \nWhy then did Gove and others that can be characterised British neoconservatives \nopt for Cameron? For Neil Clark it is more than Stelzer\u201fs idea of him as an \u201eempty \nvessel\u201f: \n \nWhat has happened is that British neoconservatives, faced with the \nnightmarish possibility that in a straight fight between David Davis and \nKenneth Clarke the more charismatic and anti-war former chancellor \nwould prevail, sought to undermine support for the latter by reinventing \nCameron, the pro-war Thatcherite, as the voice of Tory \u201emoderation\u201f.62 \n \nThis \u201ccloak-and-dagger\u201d approach is mocked in the pages of the Henry Jackson \nSociety manifesto,63 yet it seems undeniable that in Cameron they have an ally. \nMany of his more explicit pronouncements on foreign policy make sense within \nthis context. This is especially the case in a 2005 speech given before he became \nleader. It discusses the weakness of the West in the face of threats in the 1990s \n 17 \nthat can be seen as preludes to the terrorism of 2001: Somalia, the embassy \nbombings in Africa, and the USS Cole.64 Cameron claimed that the war on Iraq \nwas justified, and signifies his opposition to a \u201cpremature withdrawal \u2013 and a \nfailure to support the Iraqi authority\u201d. Like others he claims that it was \u201cFrench \nobstruction\u201d that denied the second resolution on Iraq and tellingly titles one of \nthe sections of his speech \u201cHomeland Security\u201d.65  \n \nOn September 11th 2006, explicitly timed to mark five years of the \u201ewar on \nterror\u201f, Cameron outlined a number of differences between what he called \u201eliberal \nconservatism\u201f and \u201eneo-conservatism\u201f.66 Neo-conservatism could be characterised \nas \u201ca realistic appreciation of the scale of the threat the world faces from \nterrorism\u201d; \u201ca conviction that pre-emptive military action is not only an \nappropriate, but a necessary component of tackling the terrorist threat in the \nshort term\u201d; and \u201ca belief that in the medium and long term, the promotion of \nfreedom and democracy, including through regime change, is the best guarantee \nof our security\u201d. He suggested that the judgment of neo-conservatism had to be \nmixed, but that the clear aim from this point forward had to be \u201cdeveloping with \nAmerica a tough and effective foreign policy for the age of international terrorism \n\u2013 a policy that moves beyond neo-conservatism, retaining its strengths but \nlearning from its failures\u201d. Cameron explicitly signs up to the first of the neo-\nconservative principles; and adds that \u201cI believe that the neo-conservatives are \nright to argue that extending freedom is an essential objective of Western \nforeign policy\u201d. He also supports the idea that \u201cWestern powers should be \nprepared, in the last resort, to use military force\u201d, but suggests that what has \nbeen lacking in the last five years is \u201chumility and patience\u201d. \n \nOn the basis of these two words he wants to inject a conservative scepticism \ntoward \u201cgrand schemes to remake the world\u201d. He thus sets his \u201cliberal \nconservatism\u201d in opposition to \u201cneo-conservatism\u201d. The \u201econservatism\u201f comes not \nonly from t a scepticism  but also recognition of \u201cthe complexities of human \n 18 \nnature\u201d; yet the \u201eliberal\u201f comes because he supports \u201cthe aim of spreading \nfreedom and democracy, and support[s] humanitarian intervention\u201d. This leads \nhim to five propositions: \n \nFirst, that we should understand fully the threat we face. \nSecond, that democracy cannot quickly be imposed from outside. \nThird, that our strategy needs to go far beyond military action. \nFourth, that we need a new multilateralism to tackle the new global \nchallenges we face. \nAnd fifth, that we must strive to act with moral authority. \n \nWhile it would be glib to suggest this is merely finessing differences within neo-\nconservatism, this is certainly a debate within a dominant conception of foreign \npolicy. Yet some of these are assertions where nobody would really assert the \nopposite \u2013 especially relevant for points 1, 3, and 5 \u2013 which is, at best, banal. \nWhile there are differences from prominent US neo-conservatives on some key \naspects, perhaps particularly on the urge for multilateralism, there seems to be \nlittle here to which Blair would not agree. Indeed, on the last point Cameron is at \nmost disagreeing with Blair on the application of a principle concerning \u201cthe \ncommon values of humanity\u201d rather than the principle itself. Cameron adds: \u201cbut \nif we assume \u2013 and I think we should assume \u2013 some responsibility for extending \nthese values internationally, we must strive to do so in a way that is consistent \nand honourable. A moral mission requires moral methods\u201d. Legitimacy is thus \nkey to this \u201eliberal conservatism\u201f.67 \n \nThe Henry Jackson Society has criticised some of the points of Cameron\u201fs \nspeech, suggesting it was \u201cpartisan party politics\u201d, \u201clight on stressing the \nimportance of \u201evalues\u201f\u201d and \u201cmuddled\u201d. Most critically it accuses him of not \nhaving realised that the world changed on September 11th 2001.  \n \n 19 \nIs Mr. Cameron a post 11th September person or a pre 11th September \nperson? In other words, has he realised that our supporting of dictators \noverseas causes extremism, or is he content to carry on by supporting \ntyrannies, so long as they are our \u201efriends\u201f?68  \n \nHow far, then, should idealism be tempered by realism? Some of Cameron\u201fs \nother foreign policy ideas have also raised problems. One of these was his \ncommitment to leave the centre-right \u201cEuropean people\u201fs party\u201d coalition within \nthe European parliament, which was kicked into the long grass because of the \nproblematic nature of the alternative alliances.69 Yet we would suggest that \nthese policies are not fully formed, and demonstrate that the field is open to \nchange. From a different perspective, this is exactly how the Henry Jackson \nSociety sees it. \n \nThere are many positive points in Mr. Cameron\u201fs \u201eliberal conservatism\u201f to \nrecommend it for those who support a values-based, robust, \ninterventionist, global posture for Britain with a foreign policy that marries \nprinciples, power and interests. However, there is also a great deal of \nincoherence, generated by the evident tension between Mr. Cameron \ntalking to competing galleries.70 \n \nThe Foreign Policy of the Future \n \nThe Henry Jackson Society notes that \u201cthere is no clear trajectory for the future \nof British foreign policy\u201d.71 The Society proudly triumphs the way that it has been \n\u201cdescribed as either \u201eBlairite\u201f or \u201eNeoconservative\u201f\u201d as proof of its \u201cnon-partisan \nnature\u201d.72 Yet these positions are not nearly as far apart as such a positioning \nmight imply, and Cameron is explicit that his \u201cnew approach to foreign affairs \u2013 \nliberal conservatism\u201d is one which seeks to retain \u201cthe strengths of the neo-\nconservative approach while learning from its failures\u201d.73 Some of its affiliates \n 20 \nhave seen Ariel Sharon\u201fs breaking of Israeli politics through the Kadima party as \na similar move of uniting elements of the traditional left and right.74 Other \ncommentators have seen Bush\u201fs remaking of foreign policy as doing something \nsimilar.75 Thus the Henry Jackson Society sees themselves \u201cas a bi-partisan \ngroup of progressives and democrats\u201d eager to shape the future contours of \nBritish foreign policy .76 \n \nDespite its differences, particularly situating itself more on the left, The Euston \nManifesto is similarly a project that proclaims itself as an alliance of \u201cdemocrats \nand progressives\u201d. This too seeks to broaden its alliance \u201cbeyond the socialist \nLeft towards egalitarian liberals and others of unambiguous democratic \ncommitment\u201d.77 Though some of its signatories opposed the Iraq war, it \ngenerally advocates a strong interventionist foreign policy. This opposition within \nthe movement already speaks to the key concern. A policy of intervention \nnecessarily needs lines to be drawn and choices to be made. Yet both The \nEuston Manifesto, The Henry Jackson Society, neoconservatism and liberal \nhumanitarians seems unable to agree on the criteria by which such decisions can \nbe arrived at. Divisions in the international community led to the UN being \nbypassed in Kosovo and inaction in Rwanda. Iraq split the Security Council in the \nunderstanding of resolution 1441, and the possibility of a second resolution \nunambiguously endorsing action. Others have raised the question of why Iraq \nwas targeted when other abuses of human rights are tacitly allowed, in, for \nexample, Zimbabwe, Myanmar and China. Only recently have the tensions of \ngreat power politics been sufficiently resolved to enable an united front on the \nsituation in Sudan. \n \nBlair\u201fs foreign policy might be characterised as an idealism moderated by realism.  \nInterventions that should take place may be limited by the realm of what is \npossible. The Henry Jackson Society has a similar definition of scope, as would, \nwe suggest, Cameron and Hague. For the signatories of the Euston Manifesto, \n 21 \nhowever, \u201cthere is a duty upon the international community of intervention and \nrescue. Once a threshold of inhumanity has been crossed, there is a \n\u201eresponsibility to protect\u201d.78 The Manifesto does not, however, specify what that \n\u201ethreshold of inhumanity\u201f might look like beyond condemning murder, torture and \nslaughter \u2013 as one would expect \u2013 and whether it might in practice vary from \nplace to place. For others there is a straight-forward realism: act where it is \nclearly in the national self-interest. Blair has been clear in rejecting this equation, \nsuggesting that his policies are ones of \u201cenlightened self-interest\u201d, where in a \nglobalised world \u201cself-interest and our mutual interests are today inextricably \nwoven together\u201d.79 What is revealing is how this idealism moderated by realism \nseems to be almost the exact reverse of what Cook was initially advocating in \nLabour\u201fs foreign policy. There the call for an \u201cethical perspective\u201d was to use \nvalues as a check or balance to foreign policy, rather than putatively universal \nvalues being the end in themselves. For Gove this is the move from moral \nrelativism towards moral clarity. Yet inevitably values are a contested region, and \nthe universal model of values espoused by Bush, Blair and the British \nneoconservatives is, despite their claims, not shared by all.  \n \nAlthough he disagrees on the desirable outcome from The Henry Jackson \nSociety, David Clark has similarly called for a rethinking and realigning that can \nfollow the end of the Blair era, to \u201ctake a new direction in the fight against \nterrorism around which liberals and progressives can unite\u201d. He suggests that to \nsquander this opportunity \u201cwould be to play into the hands of those who want \nthe next era of British politics to be a conservative one\u201d.80 Looking at what that \nmight be, especially through the eyes of the Henry Jackson Society is revealing. \nCameron has, like Blair before him, stressed the assertion of values as guides to \nforeign policy in the \u201ewar on terror\u201f.81 And notably Hague has called for a respect \nfor human rights to be at the core of British foreign policy. In a speech strikingly \nreminiscent of Blair, he declares \n \n 22 \nNot only is it right to champion freedom, justice and human rights, it is \nalso in our national interests to do so. It has become increasingly clear in \nrecent years that dictators do not make good partners \u2013 politically, \ncommercially or strategically. They sow instability, reek of corruption, and \nthreaten their own people.82 \n \nThere have of course been differences, notably over Lebanon, where Hague\u201fs \nattitude was not only more in keeping with wider public opinion but was perhaps \nalso a tactic intended to exploit Labour divisions.83 As noted above, comments \nconcerning Iraq have shown a similar logic. Kenneth Adelman described the neo-\nconservative guiding principle as \u201cthe idea of a tough foreign policy on behalf of \nmorality, the idea of using our power for moral good in the world\u201d.84 Though \nAdelman suggests that this is dead for a generation because of the Iraq debacle, \nit is not difficult to see how Cameron, like Blair and Brown, would sign up to this \nprinciple.  \n \nFor Matthew Jamison of the Henry Jackson Society, Cameron has planted \u201chis \nstandard firmly in interventionist territory\u201d. Yet it suggests that he needs to be \ncautious. The ideals of his \u201eliberal conservatism\u201f are ultimately irreconcilable, \nJamison suggests, with diplomatic realism. Jamison hopes that in the last \ninstance, Cameron\u201fs \u201cinterventionist convictions will overwhelm the Realist \ncaution that would be inimical to Britain\u201fs ethical and strategic interests\u201d.85 Thus \non many things in foreign policy the new British conservatism is not so different \nfrom Blair. And that is precisely the reason we should be concerned. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe would like to thank the referees for their helpful comments on an earlier \nversion of this paper.
