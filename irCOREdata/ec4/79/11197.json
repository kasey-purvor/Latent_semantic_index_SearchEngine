The skewness of broad Type 2-like spectra has\nbeen studied using data collected by two orthogonal CW\n50-MHz radio links with co-located scattering volumes.\nGeometrical aspect angles of observations were about\n10\u00b0. One short event was considered. For this event, the\nelectron flow direction was changing periodically (peri-\nod about 9 minutes) presumably due to the passage of a\nmagnetospheric MHD wave through the ionosphere. It\nwas found that for the radar observations along the\nelectrojet flow, the skewness had the same sign as the\nmean Doppler shift with average absolute values in\nbetween 0.5\u20131.0. For observations perpendicular to the\nelectrojet flow, spectra were more symmetrical (average\nskewness was around 0) and the sign of the skewness\nwas sometimes opposite to the sign of the mean Doppler\nshift. These observations are interpreted in terms of\ncontribution from both the Farley-Buneman and gradi-\nent-drift instabilities to the resultant spectrum. Di\u0080er-\nences with radar observations at small aspect angles are\ndiscussed.\n1 Introduction\nRecent 50-MHz radar observations in the Canadian\nArctic showed that, even at very unfavourable geomet-\nrical aspect angles of more than 10\u00b0, echoes occurred at\nleast 5% of the observational time (Kustov et al., 1994;\n1995). For these large aspect echoes, as for those\nobserved at small aspect angles of several degrees, all\nknown types of spectra have been identified (Haldoupis,\n1989; Osterried, 1993).\nOf all the echoes observed, those with broad spectra\nwere longer in duration than other types of spectra,\nespecially for large magnetic disturbances of more than\n400\u2013500 nT (Osterried, 1993). These echoes varied\nslowly in time and space and persisted for several hours.\nTypically, broad spectra were observed simultaneously\nat di\u0080erent flow angles, similar to small aspect type 2\nechoes during low ambient electric field conditions,\nwhen the gradient-drift instability is the likely source of\nirregularities. This was the reason why the large aspect\nangle broad spectra were labelled type 2 (Kustov et al.,\n1994). What distinguished these echoes from classical\ntype 2 echoes was their mean Doppler shift; sometimes\nthese echoes had a mean Doppler shift in excess of the\nion-acoustic velocity.\nFor background plasma flow faster than the ion-\nacoustic velocity, the Farley-Buneman instability is\nanother source of metre-scale irregularities. At small\naspect angles, the Farley-Buneman instability can gen-\nerate narrow type 1 irregularities which results in a\nstrong power increase along the electrojet direction. At\nlarge aspect angles, however, echoes along the electrojet\n(parallel echoes) were usually not narrow type 1-like but\nbroad, type 2-like, even for electric fields as large as\n60 mV\/m (Kustov et al., 1997). The intensity of these\nbroad parallel echoes was about the same as that of\nechoes simultaneously observed perpendicular to the\nelectrojet (perpendicular echoes). The spectral width of\nthe parallel echoes was even slightly greater than that for\nthe perpendicular echoes (Kustov et al., 1995). These\nobservations suggest that the e\u0080ect of the Farley-\nBuneman turbulence at large aspect angles is sometimes\nnot as pronounced as it is at small aspect angles. One\nshould mention that narrow type 1-like echoes were also\nobserved at large aspect angles, but not as regularly as at\nsmall aspect angles (Osterried, 1993). Kustov et al.\n(1997) suggested that these narrow type 1\/type 3 echoes\noccur when radar waves experience strong ionospheric\nrefraction so that small aspect angles are achieved, as\nwas predicted by Uspensky and Williams (1988) and\nUspensky et al. (1994).\nKustov et al. (1994) and Osterried et al. (1995)\nstudied the shape of large aspect angle broad type 2\nechoes. The shape of spectra was characterized by the\nthird moment in the power spectral distribution, theCorrespondence to: A. V. Kustov\nAnn. Geophysicae 15, 760\u2013766 (1997) \u00d3 EGS \u2013 Springer-Verlag 1997\nskewness. For an asymmetric spectrum with a tail\ntowards higher (smaller) frequencies in a spectral power\ndistribution, skewness is positive (negative). It was\ndiscovered that large aspect angle and small aspect\nangle broad echoes are typically skewed di\u0080erently. At\nlarge aspect angles, spectra with a positive mean\nDoppler shift have positive skewness and spectra with\na negative mean Doppler shift have negative skewness.\nThe situation is opposite for small aspect angles; positive\nskewness occurs with negative mean Doppler shift and\nnegative skewness with positive mean Doppler shift.\nOsterried et al. (1995) hypothesized that this di\u0080er-\nence was, at least partially, due to variation in the ratio\nof the Farley-Buneman turbulence to the gradient-drift\nturbulence contributions into resultant broad spectra.\nAt small aspect angles, a broad type 2 spectrum is a\nsuperposition of scattering from weak gradient-drift\nwaves, distributed isotropically in all flow directions,\nand strong Farley-Buneman waves dominating in the\nwide cone of flow angles along the electrojet direction.\nThis explanation was given first by Greenwald et al.\n(1975) and later confirmed in several studies (e.g.,\nHaldoupis et al., 1984). At large aspect angles, accord-\ning to Osterried et al. (1995), the contribution from the\nFarley-Buneman waves to the resultant spectrum is not\nso great in power, and the Farley-Buneman spectral line\nitself is rather broad. In this case, skewness of the\nspectrum could be positive for positive mean Doppler\nshift. No other reasonable explanations for di\u0080erence in\nskewness of small and large aspect type 2 echoes have\nbeen o\u0080ered. One should mention that current theories\nof the Farley-Buneman and gradient-drift turbulence\nexplain only the small aspect angle results (see discus-\nsion in Osterried et al., 1995).\nThough Osterried et al. (1995) stated that the signs of\nskewness and mean Doppler shift were the same, there\nwere numerous spectra for which the signs of skewness\nand mean shift were actually di\u0080erent, unlike those for\nthe bulk of echoes (see their Fig. 6). Moreover, Kustov\net al. (1994) found a similarity in skewness between\nbroad type 2 spectra observed in the polar cap and the\nsmall aspect angle ones. These facts might cast a doubt\nin conclusion of Osterried et al. (1995). However, more\nrecent radar observations of Kustov et al. (1996) using\nthe SAPPHIRE-North radar showed that for observa-\ntions perpendicular to the electrojet, the spectra could be\nskewed both positively and negatively for positive mean\nDoppler shift. Only for observations along the electrojet\nis there agreement in the signs of skewness and mean\nDoppler shift. This conclusion cannot be substantiated\n(or rejected) with Osterried et al.\u2019s (1995) data; typical\nflow angles of those observations were 40\u201350 degrees for\nboth radio links and there were very few events with\nvelocities in excess of 300\u2013400 m\/s, for which the e\u0080ect\nof the Farley-Buneman turbulence could be strong.\nIn this study, data of the same auroral zone radar\nexperiment that was used by Osterried et al. (1995), are\nconsidered for one unique event, April 04, 1993. During\nthis event, strong quasi-periodic variations of the\nelectrojet flow direction occurred, so that the hypothesis\nof Osterried et al. (1995) regarding the relationship of\nskewness of type 2 spectra and the flow angle of radar\nobservations could be checked in a straightforward\nmanner.\n2 Experiment\nOn April 04, 1993 two CW 50-MHz radio links with\nnearly overlapping scattering volumes were operational\nin the Canadian Prairies as shown in Fig. 1. Transmit-\nters were located at LaCrete (Alberta) and Gillam\n(Manitoba), and the receiver was in Saskatoon (Sas-\nkatchewan). The antenna arrays for both transmitter\nsites were 8 Yagis separated by 6 m. The receiving\nantenna was polarimetric; it consisted of two sets of 12\nYagis oriented at the angles 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 with respect to\nthe horizon. The main collecting regions for both links\nwere about 50 \u00b4 50 km2 (at the 6-dB level of attenua-\ntion) in size so that there was a partial overlapping of\nthese regions.\nThe experiment was run in a mode with the reception\nof scattered signals on both 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 polarimetry\nantennae but, as was discovered later, the 135\u00b0 channel\nhad technical problems so that data from that channel\nwere not used for this study. To smooth the temporal\nvariations of signals, 10-s averaging of the spectra was\napplied. More detailed description of the radio links can\nbe found elsewhere (Kustov et al. 1995; Osterried et al.,\n1995).\n3 Observations\nOn April 4, 1993, the CANOPUS Rabbit Lake magne-\ntometer (for CANOPUS see Grant and McDiarmid,\n1992) located near the radar target regions showed that\nthe magnetic field was quite stable almost the whole\nnight except for small and smooth magnetic variations\naround local magnetic midnight. This was typical across\nFig. 1. The geometry of the experiment. Two transmitters were\nlocated at LaCrete and Gillam, two receivers at Saskatoon. Invariant\nlatitudes according to the Polar Anglo-American Conjugate Exper-\niment (PACE) coordinate system (Baker and Wing, 1989) are shown\nby dashed lines. The link bisectors are marked by thick dotted line.\nBlack triangle is the location of Rabbit Lake (RA) magnetometer site\nA. V. Kustov et al.: Flow angle dependence for the asymmetry of broad 50-MHz coherent echoes at large magnetic aspect angles 761\nthe entire world; Kp indices were between 1 and 2\n(Co\u0080ey, 1993). Figure 2 shows a standard Rabbit Lake\nmagnetogram. A very strong and sharp onset of\nmagnetic activity occurred at about 1500 UT (about\n0900 MLT). This magnetic activity started with a strong\nSC (sudden commencement) impulse at 1432 UT\nrecorded not only in Rabbit Lake but in many other\nplaces around the world, e.g. according to European\nSAMNET magnetometer records (M. Lester, private\ncommunication, 1993). About 20 minutes later, the\nmagnetic field X-component in Rabbit Lake began a\nrapid negative trend reaching magnitudes of )800 nT\nafter 1500 UT. Simultaneously strong variations in Y\nand Z components of several hundred nanoteslas were\nobserved (see, for example, in Fig. 2 variations in the Y-\ncomponent). After 1800 UT, a quick recovery of the\nmagnetic field occurred.\nThe sharp onset of magnetic variations at 1450 UT\nwas followed by strong temporal fluctuations of the\nmagnetic field at Pc5 range (period of \u0018 9 minutes\naccording to FFT analysis), see Fig. 2. These oscilla-\ntions were particularly pronounced in the Y-component\nof the magnetic field. Strong magnetic pulsations lasted\ntill about 1630 UT.\nThese strong periodic variations in the magnetic field\nwere accompanied by periodic broad type 2 echoes on\nboth the G-S and L-S radio links. Strong variations in\necho parameters were evident during the first hour of\necho onset though the echoes lasted until about 1800\nUT, as shown by the horizontal bar in the middle panel\nof Fig. 2. Clearly, echoes occurred for magnetic distur-\nbances of more than 400\u2013500 nT, in agreement with\nOsterried (1993).\nFigure 3 shows the spectral distribution of the G-S\nlink power versus time for the period 1500\u20131600 UT, for\nwhich the radar pulsations were very clear. Variations in\nthe width of the echoes can also be recognized. Similar\necho pulsations, but not as clear as these, were observed\non the L-S link.\nFigure 4 shows temporal behaviour of the power (a),\nmean Doppler velocity (b) and skewness (e) of the\nspectra for both radio links during the first hour of the\nradar auroral activity. The L-S link data are shown by a\nthick line and the G-S link data are shown by a thin line.\nPulsations in power (Fig. 4a) were more obvious for the\nG-S link where di\u0080erences between the minimum and\nmaximum power were as large as 7 dB. The echo\nintensity on both links was low with mean values of\n5\u201310 dB (note that direct comparison of the power\nbetween two links is inappropriate since radio links were\nnot properly calibrated).\nVelocity pulsations (Fig. 4b), especially for the G-S\nlink, were very clear. The magnitude of the variations\nwas about 400 m\/s for the G-S link and 300 m\/s for the\nL-S link. It is obvious that the velocity changes for the\nL-S link were roughly in phase with the velocity changes\nfor the G-S link (with some DC o\u0080set); large positive\nvalues of the G-S velocity occurred at times of minimal\nnegative velocity on the L-S link and vice versa. This\ne\u0080ect is illustrated in Fig. 4 for two specific times\nlabelled 1 and 2.\nThe observed velocity variations can be interpreted as\na result of periodic variations in the electron flow\nazimuth. Since the mean Doppler velocity of the broad\ntype 2 echoes is proportional to the cosine component of\nthe plasma flow along the radar link bisector (Kustov\net al., 1997), the electron flow azimuth can be deter-\nmined by simply merging the L-S and G-S mean\nDoppler velocities (see Nielsen and Schlegel, 1985).\nFigure 4c shows temporal variations of the electron flow\nazimuth h during the interval under consideration. Note\nthat the azimuth is measured CCW from the east (rather\nthan normally the north). Clearly, the flow azimuth\nvaried periodically between two extremes, h1 \u0088 \u00ff40\u000e\nand h2 \u0088 \u008750\u000e. The first extreme corresponds to elec-\ntron flow along the G-S radio link bisector (as at the\ntime labelled 1) while the second extreme corresponds to\nthe electron flow almost along the L-S radio link\nbisector (as at the time labelled 2).\nVariations of the electron flow direction shown in\nFig. 4c are the superposition of a background flow\ndirected eastward along the lines of constant PACE\nlatitude (the mean electron flow azimuth in Fig. 4c is\naround zero) and a periodic north-south flow. A clear\npossibility is that the periodic north-south component of\nthe flow is associated with a MHD wave which has\npropagated down the Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines into\nthe radar scattering volume (Yeoman et al., 1990). This\nsuggestion is supported by the Rabbit Lake magnet-\nometer data. In Fig. 4, the Y-component of the magnetic\nfield (which has been pass-filtered for periods between\n250 and 1000 s) is shown. Vertical bars indicate the\ntimes when the electron flow is along the G-S radio\nlink \u0085h1 \u0088 \u00ff40\u000e\u0086, which should be the times when the\nY-component has maximum negative deviations. Good\nagreement of these bars and the magnetometer trace\nminima is obvious for almost the whole period of\nobservations.\nAlso obvious from Fig. 4 is that the relationship\nbetween the power and velocity was di\u0080erent for the L-S\nFig. 2. Magnetic variations recorded at Rabbit Lake on April 4,\n1993. The horizontal bar on the middle panel indicates the times of 50-\nMHz coherent echo occurrence\n762 A. V. Kustov et al.: Flow angle dependence for the asymmetry of broad 50-MHz coherent echoes at large magnetic aspect angles\nand G-S links. For the L-S link, the power and velocity\nvaried in phase. One can see a nearly simultaneous\noccurrence of peaks in the velocity and power at 1502,\n1511, 1524 and 1531 UT (later on, the L-S echo power\npulsations disappeared). For the G-S link, the power\nand the velocity were not in phase, the velocity maxima\nwere somewhere in between the power maxima and\nminima (see times of 1501, 1509, 1521, 1529 and so on).\nComparison with riometer recordings at Rabbit Lake\nshowed that the echo power on both links correlated\nwith intensifications of absorption. This suggests that\nthe echo power was strongly influenced by conductivity\nvariations rather than electric field variations. Similar\nresults have been obtained by Yeoman et al. (1990) for\nhigher frequency radar and magnetic pulsations.\nIn Fig. 4e, the skewness versus time is plotted for\nboth links. Pulsations with a period of about 9 min are\nalso seen. Moreover, the maxima of G-S skewness\ncorrelate well with the minima of the absolute value of\nL-S skewness. The maxima of G-S skewness correspond\nto the G-S velocity maxima. Such a relationship is not\nobvious for the L-S spectra, in agreement with results of\nOsterried et al. (1995). The relationship between skew-\nness and velocity of spectra is evaluated quantitatively in\nthe next two sections.\n4 Skewness versus radial velocity\nIn Fig. 5 the relationship between signs of the mean\nDoppler shift and skewness is explored in a way similar\nto Osterried et al. (1995). First, only those measurements\nwere considered for which G-S velocities were larger (in\nabsolute value) than L-S velocities (Fig. 5a). This would\nimply that the G-S radio link bisector was closer to the\nelectrojet direction than the L-S radio-link bisector.\nSkewness of the spectra on the L-S link \u0085SL\u0086 versus\nskewness of the spectra on the G-S link \u0085SG\u0086 is presented\nFig. 3. Doppler spectra of co-\nherent echoes received on April 4,\n1993 on the Gillam-Saskatoon\n50-MHz radio link. To obtain the\nmean velocity shift and spectral\nwidth the values in Hz should be\nmultiplied by a factor 3.1\nFig. 4a\u2013e.

V. Kustov et al.: Flow angle dependence for the asymmetry of broad 50-MHz coherent echoes at large magnetic aspect angles 763\nin Fig. 5b. Clearly, SG > SL for most of the measure-\nments. Then, measurements with L-S velocities larger\nthan G-S velocities (the L-S bisector closer to the\nelectrojet direction) were considered (Fig. 5c). For these\ntimes, the cloud of points was definitively shifted\ntowards stronger skewness on the L-S link, though not\nentirely (Fig. 5d).\n5 Skewness versus flow angle\nTo describe the flow angle variation of the skewness in a\nmore quantitative manner, measurements of the skew-\nness for the G-S and L-S radio links were plotted in\nFig. 6 as a function of the electron drift azimuth h.\nFigure 6a shows the scatter plot of the G-S skewness\nversus h (points) and the statistical trend in this\ndependence (large circles). Each large circle in Fig. 6\nwas obtained by binning the skewness within 10\u00b0-bins in\nh, beginning from h \u0088 \u00ff40\u000e. In each bin, the mean value\n(circle) and the standard deviation r (vertical bar\naround each circle spans the range from \u00ffr to \u0087r\u0086\nwere calculated. From Fig. 6a, one can see that the G-S\nskewness decreases almost linearly from about \u00871:0 at\nh1 \u0088 \u00ff40\u000e (at which angle the flow is almost along this\nlink bisector) to \u0019 0 at h \u0088 \u008740\u000e (for which the flow is\nalmost perpendicular to this link bisector). In Fig. 6b,\nthe L-S skewness is plotted versus h. These data\ndemonstrate the linear increase of skewness, but one\nshould keep in mind that, for the L-S radio-link,\nh1 \u0088 \u00ff40\u000e corresponds to observations almost perpen-\ndicular to the electron flow and h \u0088 \u008740\u000e corresponds to\nobservations almost along the link bisector.\nIn Fig. 6c, the average trend in the dependence of the\nskewness versus h for the G-S radio link is presented\nsimultaneously with the trend in the absolute value of\nthe L-S skewness. Obviously, when the electron flow was\nalong the G-S radar link bisector \u0085h1 \u0088 \u00ff40\u000e\u0086, the G-S\nspectra were much more skewed while when the electron\nflow was along the L-S radio link bisector \u0085h \u0088 \u008740\u000e\u0086,\nthe L-S spectra were more skewed. Also, for observa-\ntions along the electron flow, spectra were more skewed\non the G-S radio link.\n6 Discussion and conclusions\nObservations of the asymmetry of auroral type 2 spectra\nreported in this study are in agreement with the majority\nof Osterried et al.\u2019s (1995) measurements and support\nthe conclusions of other observations performed with\nsimilar radio links but at higher latitudes (Kustov et al.,\n1994; 1996). Along the electrojet direction, the skewness\nof the spectra is positive (negative) for positive (nega-\ntive) mean Doppler shift while across the electrojet any\ncombination of velocity and skewness sign is possible. In\naddition, this work shows that spectra are more\nasymmetric for observations along the electrojet.\nOsterried et al. (1995) reviewed several ideas for\nexplanation the unusual asymmetry of large aspect angle\nbroad echoes observed along the electrojet. Their basic\nconclusion was that none of the current theories are\nFig. 5a\u2013d.

V. Kustov et al.: Flow angle dependence for the asymmetry of broad 50-MHz coherent echoes at large magnetic aspect angles\nsuccessful. The most likely reason for this di\u0081culty lies\nin the fact that the echoes considered are indeed the\nlarge aspect angle ones. At the large aspect angles,\nplasma waves can be only generated nonlinearly by\neither the Farley-Buneman or the gradient-drift insta-\nbility or both. The skewness of the resultant spectrum is\nstrongly dependent on the relative contribution from\neach of these instabilities.\nFor low electric fields and for small aspect angles,\nwhen only the gradient-drift instability is operational,\none might expect the symmetrical spectra as suggested in\nthe mode-coupling theory (e.g., Sudan, 1983). A small\nasymmetry might arise from plasma turbulence itself, as\nknown from simulations (Keskinen et al., 1979, their\nFig. 6). Another factor contributing to the measured\nasymmetry might be the e\u0080ects of altitude integration\n(Kustov and Uspensky, 1995). All these e\u0080ects cause\nnegative skewness for positive Doppler shift. It is\ndi\u0081cult to assess their importance at the large aspect\nangles relevant to the present study.\nFor stronger electric fields, the Farley-Buneman\ninstability is operational, and it also contributes to the\nresultant spectrum. One would expect that the Farley-\nBuneman turbulence contribution is more important for\nobservations along the electrojet, the direction for which\nthe instability is much easier to excite. However, since\nthe Farley-Buneman instability is excited directly only in\na relatively narrow cone of small aspect angles, its e\u0080ect\nmight not be very strong at large aspect angles. For large\naspect angles, it might be that non-linearly excited\n(secondary) Farley-Buneman waves have a wider fre-\nquency band (not resonant peak at the ion-acoustic\nvelocity as at small o\u0080-perpendicular angles) and they\nare distributed more isotropically with the flow angle. In\nthis case, the spectrum along the electrojet would be\ncomposed of a symmetrical background gradient-drift\/\nFarley-Buneman spectrum (as at any large flow angle)\nand an extra high frequency tail. More theoretical work\nis required to justify this hypothesis.\nInterpreting the asymmetry of broad large aspect\nechoes as a flow angle e\u0080ect in which the contribution\nfrom the Farley-Buneman instability is not very strong\n(as compared to the small aspect angle situation) implies\nthat asymmetry of spectra should vary as the aspect\nangle increases. This idea is under investigation using\n50-MHz SAPPHIRE-South radar data (Koehler et al.,\n1995). Preliminary analysis shows that, for some events,\nthere is an increase in spectral asymmetry with aspect\nangle. This tendency is not obvious in others. More\nwork is required to understand the reasons for di\u0080erent\ntendencies derived from the SAPPHIRE-South data. In\nclarifying this issue, one of the problems is separating\nvelocity variations due to aspect angle e\u0080ect from those\ndue to flow angle e\u0080ect. Recent observations also show\nthat, since the antenna arrays were tapered so that the\nside lobes were decreased, the spectra seem to be more\nsymmetrical than in previous observations, which sug-\ngests that side lobe e\u0080ects might be of importance.\nAcknowledgements.
