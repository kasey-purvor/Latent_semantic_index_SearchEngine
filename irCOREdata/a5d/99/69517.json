For \nexample, the rate of decompression during magma ascent may \ndictate the manner in which volatiles are released from the melt, \nultimately influencing degassing and the explosivity (e.g., Gon-\nnermann and Manga 2007). Similarly, crystallization in volcanic \nconduits and lava flows may generate excess volatile pressure, \nleading to nonlinear extrusion and endogenous dome explosions \n(e.g., Sparks 1997). Clearly, our ability to model magmatic \nprocesses depends on accurate determinations of timescales of \nprocesses such as crystallization and bubble growth. \nDirect measurement of the timing and duration of magmatic \nphase changes (e.g., crystallization) is challenging due to the \nextreme inaccessibility of magmatic environments; efforts to do \nso have been relegated to analyzing natural crystal chronometers \nin quenched rocks. Crystal-size distribution (CSD) analysis, \nfor example, has provided estimates of crystal growth rates in \nmagmatic systems (e.g., Cashman 1988). However, temporal \ninformation based on CSD interpretations may be subject to \nlarge errors, owing to the uncertainties of the underlying laws \ngoverning crystal growth, including assumptions that the growth \nrates of all crystals was the same.\nAdvances in timescale determinations have been made by \nanalyzing chemical gradients within crystals (Costa and Dungan \n2005) and glasses (Castro et al. 2005) combined with diffusion \nmodeling of the elemental distributions. Here, we build on these \nstudies by determining the crystallization timescales of small \nspherical crystal aggregates in obsidian, known as spherulites \n(Fig. 1). We present synchrotron Fourier transform infrared \nspectroscopic (SFTIR) measurements of water concentration \nprofiles around spherulites in obsidian. We then model the \nconcentration profiles by numerically solving the advection-\ndiffusion equation for a range of temperatures to yield model \ncrystallization timescales. \ngeologiCal BaCkground\nSpherulites are radiating, commonly concentrically arranged \naggregates of one or more anhydrous minerals set in a glassy \nmatrix (Fig. 1). They occur in obsidian domes, large-volume \nvitrophyric ash-flow tuffs (e.g., Smith et al. 2001), and in shal-\nlow volcanic conduits (e.g., Stasiuk et al. 1996).\nSpherulites are inferred to have nucleated and grown in \nresponse to large undercoolings (>200 \u00b0C) rapidly imposed \non the magma by its degassing and quenching (e.g., Swanson \net al. 1989). As dictated by the thermal profile of the magma \nbody (Manley 1992), spherulitic obsidian develops in spatially \nrestricted zones (e.g., Manley and Fink 1987; Stevenson et al. \n1994), comprising a transitional facies that separates the rapidly \nquenched, outermost vitrophyric rhyolite from a devitrified * E-mail: castroj@si.edu\n"}
