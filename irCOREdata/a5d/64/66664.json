In essence virtual envi-\nronments are a form of 3D user interface where tasks are directly\nperformed in a 3D spatial context [5]. Virtual environments are in-\ncreasing being used in a wide variety of application areas including\nengineering, micro- and nano-technology, aero and space engineer-\ning, ergonomics, defence, medicine and surgery, heritage, educa-\ntion and information visualisation [26].\nOne of the most commonly encountered virtual environments or\n3D interface is the modern 3D computer game. The current gener-\nation of computer games present realistic virtual worlds featuring\nuser friendly interaction and the simulation of real world phenom-\nena [27]. For many people, computer games will be their first, and\nmost frequent, experience of a 3D virtual world. This has impli-\ncations for evaluating performance in virtual environment and 3D\ninterface based applications. Prior experience of interacting with\n\u2217e-mail: shamus.smith@durham.ac.uk\nvirtual environments can have a notable increase in user\u2019s perfor-\nmance in virtual environment evaluations [9, 11]. As virtual envi-\nronment applications become more common there will be a need\nto accurately measure and accommodate participant\u2019s prior expe-\nrience in order to balance empirical studies of virtual environment\ninteraction. If experimental studies do not distinguish between ex-\nperienced and inexperienced users, there is a danger that any con-\nclusions may be over generalized [6].\nThere is anecdotal evidence that participants in virtual environ-\nment evaluations with prior computer gaming experience interact\nmore efficiently with the environments and exhibit higher perfor-\nmance than those without. This can be problematic if prior gaming\nexperience of participants can significantly skew evaluation results.\nThis paper describes a study to evaluate the validity of this hypoth-\nesis. The impact of prior gaming experience in the performance of\nnavigation tasks in a virtual environment has been investigated.\nSection 2 describes related work in the areas of 3D user interface\nevaluation, the impact of gaming experience, and navigation tasks.\nSection 3 will consider measuring gaming experience, our research\nhypotheses and three testing environments, including a 2D game,\na 3D game and a virtual environment supporting navigation tasks.\nA user study has been performed and is described in Section 4.\nResults of the study are discussed in Section 5. Our conclusions\nwill be presented in Section 6.\n2 RELATED WORK\nThere are three areas of related work relevant to the research pre-\nsented in this paper; evaluation of 3D user interfaces, particularly\nvirtual environments, the impact of gaming experience and naviga-\ntion tasks in virtual environments.\n2.1 Evaluation of 3D User Interfaces\nAs with traditional 2D human-computer interaction evaluation, the\nmain purpose of 3D user interface and virtual environment usabil-\nity evaluation is the identification of usability problems or issues,\nleading to changes in design in an iterative fashion to increase use-\nfulness and usability [5]. Evaluation also aims to increase overall\nunderstanding for developing design guidelines, and to develop per-\nformance models, which can be used to predict the performance of\na user on a particular task [5, 8, 16, 29].\nAs identified by [3], there are a number of distinctive charac-\nteristics of virtual environment evaluation. Issues involved can be\nroughly partitioned under physical environment issues, evaluator is-\nsues, user issues and evaluation type issues. For a study into how\ngaming experience effects virtual environment evaluations, user is-\nsues are particularly relevant.\n[3] and [5] have comprehensively classified evaluation methods\nfor virtual environments. These include cognitive walkthrough,\nheuristic evaluation, formative evaluation, summative evaluation,\nquestionnaires and interviews.\nDefining a set of usability metrics is vital for meaningful virtual\nenvironment evaluation. Bowman et al. [5] categorises metrics as:\n\u2022 Task performance metrics, e.g. speed, accuracy and number\nof errors.\n\u2022 System performance metrics, e.g. frame rate and latency fac-\ntors that affect the user\u2019s experience.\n\u2022 User preference metrics.\nThe latter type of metrics refers to subjective perception of the\ninterface by the user, for example ease of use and ease of learning.\nSubjective factors are commonly evaluated with questionnaires in-\ndicating user experiences of issues such as presence [30], user com-\nfort\/disorientation [24] and cybersickness [17].\n2.2 Impact of Gaming Experience\nFrey et al. [11] examined the effects of game experience on psycho-\nlogical experimenting within virtual environments. They focused\non whether training could diminish the performance differences be-\ntween users who play games, and users who do not. The study used\na questionnaire to evaluate participant prior experience and used\na commercial game engine, Quake III Arena1, to measure perfor-\nmance. Control of movement was restricted to forwards, backwards\nand turning motions via a keyboard. They found that users with-\nout prior experience profited greatly from training whilst those with\nprior experience did not. However, those with prior experience still\nperformed significantly better than those with the limited training.\nEnochsson et al. [9] investigated the influence of computer game\nexperience on the performance of virtual endoscopy. Seventeen\nmedical students performed a virtual gastroscopy. Computer game\nexperience was defined as either occasionally, daily or never. They\nfound that the students that played computer games were 11% more\nefficient than those who did not play computer games. Moreover\nthe computer game players were faster in performing the virtual\ntask. This is similar to the results of Grantcharov et al. [12] who\nfound that PC gamers made fewer errors and took less time to com-\nplete tasks in the MIST-VR medical simulator than did those with-\nout gaming experience. This indicates that computer games may\ncontribute to the development of skills that could be relevant for the\nperformance of laparoscopic surgery [12], i.e. indicating a perfor-\nmance bias by gamers.\nIn a fire evacuation simulator based on computer game technol-\nogy [25], previous gaming experience was found to be a factor in\nparticipant evacuation times. Expert gamers completed evacuation\nscenarios in less time than experienced gamers, who in turn evacu-\nated in less time than non-gamers. Gaming ability in this case was\ndefined by participant answers on a pre-session questionnaire.\nCastel et al. [7] considered the effects of action video game ex-\nperience on the efficiency of visual searches. Following the work\nof Green and Bavelier [13] - who suggested that experience with\nplaying video games may alter and improve the attentional system\n(also see [14]) - Castel et al. [7] found that video game players (i)\nhad significantly faster reaction times and (ii) were more efficient\nin searching through displays than non-video game players. Their\nfindings confirm that there are clear differences in performance be-\ntween gamers and non-gamers in visual attention tasks.\nInterestingly, Feng et al. [10] found that only the use of action\nvideo games, such as First-Person-Shooter (FPS) games, promoted\nimproved performances in spatial tasks. They note that non-action\ngames may be less likely to have beneficial effects as they require\nreduced spatial attentional capacities in players. They also found\ngender differences in improvements based on action video game\ntrials. Females showed larger improvements than males. However,\ngender differences are beyond the scope of the current work, which\nfocuses on the non-gamer\/gamer distinction, and will thus not be\nconsidered here further.\n1http:\/\/www.idsoftware.com\/games\/quake\/quake3-arena\/ [last access\n16\/10\/2008].\n2.3 Navigation Tasks in Virtual Environments\nThere are five major classes of interaction in virtual environments\nnamely navigation, selection, manipulation, system commands and\nsymbolic input [5]. Exploring how gaming experience may affect\nall classes of virtual environment interaction is outside the scope of\nthe research reported here. We have focused on navigation and in\nparticular on navigation tasks.\nNavigation is the most common task within virtual environ-\nments [21]. Darken and Peterson [8] present an overview of nav-\nigation in virtual environments. Navigation is a general label that\nconstitutes two sub activities; travel - moving from one location to\nanother - and wayfinding, \u201cthe cognitive process of defining a path\nthrough an environment, using and acquiring spatial knowledge,\naided by both natural and artificial cues\u201d [5, pg227]. There has\nbeen significant research into the interaction techniques of travel\n(see [2, 4, 18]), resulting in quantitative comparisons of travel tech-\nniques. There has also been extensive work into wayfinding aspects\nsuch as how users respond to environment cues such as landmarks,\nmaps and trails [8, 20, 23] and external navigation aids [22].\nPoor navigation support is a strong contributor to reduced usabil-\nity. Contributing issues include user disorientation [8, 24], wayfind-\ning problems [20] and interaction difficulties [16]. One way to sup-\nport navigation is the use of explicit navigation aids [23].\nBurigat and Chittaro [6] found that there were significant differ-\nence in how much inexperienced users benefit from different navi-\ngation aids compared to experienced users. They note that these dif-\nferences are strongly influenced by the virtual environment where\nnavigation takes place, for example abstract vs. geographic envi-\nronments. In their study experienced users were participants who\nhad multiple navigation sessions in virtual environments and had\ndesigned a virtual environment while inexperienced users had ba-\nsic experience of using computers but no experience in navigating\nvirtual environments, including 3D games or 3D editing programs.\nWaller [28] investigated the relations between a number of indi-\nvidual differences in spatial learning including computer attitudes\nand experience, proficiency with a virtual environment navigational\ninterface and the ability to acquire and transfer spatial knowledge\nfrom a virtual environment. He found that spatial ability and in-\nterface proficiency have the strongest effect on virtual environment\nspatial knowledge acquisition and that measures of spatial knowl-\nedge in a virtual environment maze were highly predictive of later\nperformance in a similar real-world maze.\n3 MEASURING GAMING EXPERIENCE\nThe primary goal of the work described here is to explore relations\nbetween a user\u2019s previous gaming experience, their actual gaming\nperformance and their virtual environment navigation performance.\nWe have explored three hypotheses:\n\u2022 H1 Participants will exhibit performance in virtual environ-\nment navigation tasks comparative with their performance in\ncomputer game environments. It is reasonable to assume that\nif a participant is skilled at computer games then transferable\nskills such as hand-eye coordination should aid them in a vir-\ntual environment.\n\u2022 H2 Participants with prior computer gaming experience will\nperform better in new computer game and navigation task\nenvironments. These participants should exhibit improved\nspeed, accuracy and spatial-awareness in their interactions.\nComputer games often require speed, accuracy and an aware-\nness of spatial surroundings. It is reasonable to assume that\nthis develops skills that are traversable to new computer game\nand virtual environments.\n\u2022 H3 Participants who play FPS computer games regularly will\nperform best in all criteria set out by H2 in a virtual environ-\nment.\n3.1 The Testing Environments\nIn order to support a user study (Section 4), three testing envi-\nronments were constructed (by the second author). Two com-\nputer games and one virtual environment were designed and im-\nplemented. Game1 (Section 3.1.1) was a 2D arcade style game,\nGame2 (Section 3.1.2) was a FPS action game and a test virtual\nenvironment (Section 3.1.3) was populated with a number of navi-\ngation based tasks.\nA comprehensive study of the currently available 3D tools, vir-\ntual reality toolkits and computer game development environments,\nsuitable for both virtual environments and computer games, was\ncompleted (also see [27]). In order to rapidly develop the virtual\nenvironment and the 3D game environment (Game2), the Valve2\nSource runtime engine and SDK was determined to be an appro-\npriate choice. The Source engine has an excellent set of tools for\nrapid environment development, excellent support and documen-\ntation, and a powerful set of features tailored towards first-person\nviewpoint environments [27]. By developing the virtual environ-\nment and Game2 in the same development system, factors such as\nframe-rate, latency, rendering technique and lighting model were\ncontrolled between the test virtual environment and the 3D game\nenvironment. Also mechanisms for collecting performance metrics,\nsuch as timing information, were added to the built environments.\n3.1.1 Game1 - Breakout\nGame1 was a recreation of the game Breakout (see Figure 1).\nBreakout is a simple 2D bat and ball game involving a paddle,\na ball and rows of coloured blocks. The objective is to destroy\nas many blocks as possible by bouncing the ball off the paddle\ninto the blocks. The player typically has three lives and loses a\nlife each time they fail to bat the ball. It is suitable as the 2D\ngame example because it provides a good measure of hand-eye\ncoordination and reflexes. The Microsoft XNA Framework3\n(C#.NET 2.0) was used to develop Game1. The XNA framework\nhas a number of advantages such as managed code with object\norientation and Just-In-Time compiling, and a state-of-the-art game\nframework designed to accelerate game development using C# and\nto maximise performance. Additionally the XNA framework has\nextensive documentation and support and is freely available. The\nperformance metric from Game1 will be the final game score.\n3.1.2 Game2 - Escape from Quarantine\nFPS computer games have a similar viewpoint and interface to first-\nperson desktop virtual environments. This genre has therefore been\nchosen for Game2 to restrain the interaction technique variables for\nthe user study.\nGame2 is a generic FPS game designed so that it increases lin-\nearly in difficulty as the player progresses through the game. This is\na defining characteristic of many single player FPS games. The per-\nformance metric for Game2 was the extent of progress (measured\nby sub-stage reached) through the game before the player is killed,\nor reaches the end of the level.\nThe scenario for Game2 is a coastline filled with enemies. The\nstoryline is that the coastline has been quarantined due to an alien\n2http:\/\/www.valvesoftware.com [last access 16\/10\/2008].\n3The Microsoft XNA Framework is similar to a C++ library or a\nJava repository. It provides commonly used utility classes, stream-\nlined for games. It also provides a common baseline architecture\nand structure for developing 2D and 3D games. For further infor-\nmation see http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/xna\/default.aspx [last access\n16\/10\/2008].\nFigure 1: Game1 - Breakout.\ninfestation and therefore the player must travel to safety at the end\nof the coastline, eliminating any enemies in their path. The game\ninitially provides the player with only a crowbar and a pistol with\nlimited ammunition as weapons. Additional resources are available\nas the player progresses through the environment.\nGame2 was built as a Half-Life 24 (HL2) modification using the\nSource engine. The HL2 resources provided a solid foundation\nfor a generic FPS as well as a wide range of enemies which can\nbe used to achieve a linear gradient of difficulty. Figure 2 shows\nexternal and internal locations in Game2.\n3.1.3 Navigation Task Virtual Environment\nThe navigation task virtual environment is a desktop-based virtual\nenvironment and contains a series of navigation-based tasks for\nparticipants to complete. The virtual environment was built using\nValve Software\u2019s SDK5 for the Source engine and extended Half-\nLife 2\u2019s base code using Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edi-\ntion.\nThe purpose of the virtual environment was to collect naviga-\ntion task performance metrics. It was designed as a linear series\nof rooms, each containing a task measuring a specific metric. The\nrooms were separated by mid-way rooms with instructions on the\nwalls for the next task. This layout ensures that the task metrics are\nmeasured independently and allows clear instructions to be given\nfor each task in isolated environments.\nThe virtual environment had a fixed horizon and any paths are\nsufficiently wide to minimise cybersickness. At the very minimum,\nintersecting walls have a different texture to aid navigation. The\nsubsequent sections (3.1.4-3.1.7) describe the specific tasks used to\nelicit the navigation task metrics.\n3.1.4 Task 1\nThe first task (see Figure 3) is designed to measure the participant\u2019s\nspatial perception and is based upon experiments described in [24].\nInstructions are given in a start room for the participant to navigate\nto a finish room. Immediately after completing the navigation task,\nparticipants were asked to identify a 2D plan, or birds-eye view,\nof the environment from four different paths to determine if they\nhad constructed an accurate mental model of the environment. The\n4Half-Life 2 is a FPS game which uses the Valve Source 3D engine. For\nfurther information please refer to htt p : \/\/hal f \u2212 li f e2.com\/ [last access\n16\/10\/2008].\n5The Valve SDK is a collection of source code, resources - i.e. textures\nand sounds - and tools supplied by Valve Software for developing games\nthat run on their proprietary 3D Game Engine, Source. For further infor-\nmation please refer to http:\/\/developer.valvesoftware.com\/wiki\/SDK Docs\n[last access 16\/10\/2008].\nalternatives consisted of the actual path (alternative B in Figure 3)\nand of paths both more and less complex than the actual path. This\nprovides a rudimentary metric and an indication of a participant\u2019s\nspatial perception, i.e whether an environment is perceived as more\nor less complex than it actually is [24].\nFigure 2: Game2 - Escape from Quarantine.\nFigure 3: Task 1: The simplest task required participants to walk\nalong a path and then to identify their path from four alternative layout\nillustrations to measure spatial perception.\n3.1.5 Tasks 2 and 3\nTasks 2 and 3 are designed to measure the participant\u2019s searching\nabilities for na\u0131\u00a8ve and primed searches, respectively. The resul-\ntant metrics are search times. The tasks are based on similar work\nby [4].\nBoth rooms contained an identical maze with an entrance\nand exit (see Figure 4). Participants are instructed in the first\ninstruction room to find the exit of the subsequent maze in the\nquickest possible time. Once a participant has completed the first\nmaze, they are then informed in a second instruction room that\nthe next maze is identical and that they should again find the exit\nwith speed. The virtual environment records how long it takes for\na participant to complete each task.\n3.1.6 Task 4\nThe fourth task required the participant to jump across an alarmed\nfloor using wooden boards as stepping stones (see Figure 5). The\nfloor glowed red when it was stepped on. Times were recorded\nfor the durations spent on the floor, classified as a mistake. This\nmeasured participant\u2019s advanced movement abilities.\n3.1.7 Task 5\nThe final task is designed to measure the participant\u2019s speed when\ntravelling with high accuracy. Participants are instructed in an in-\nstruction room that they must traverse a narrow path suspended be-\ntween two platforms in the fastest possible time (see Figure 6). If\nFigure 4: Task 2 and 3: The next tasks were identical mazes. Partici-\npants were asked to find the exit. These tasks measured participants\nsearch times for na\u0131\u00a8ve and primed searches, and hence travel and\nwayfinding abilities.\nFigure 5: Task 4: Jumping across an alarmed floor using wooden\nboards as stepping stones. The floor glowed red when it was stepped\non.\na participant falls off the path they are teleported back to the begin-\nning of the path. The resultant metric is the time taken to success-\nfully cross from one platform to the other.\nAs illustrated by Figure 6 the path contains at least one 180\u25e6\nturn and at least six 90\u25e6 turns. As described by [15], this provides\na fairly complicated path for traversal by unskilled participants.\nMoreover, the path is only in two dimensions to maximise the\nrange of potential scores. Finally, the participant is not allowed to\njump in this task.\nFigure 6: Task 5: The final task required participants to walk along a\ncomplicated path above a ravine as fast as possible. This measured\nparticipant speed when travelling with high accuracy requirements.\n4 USER STUDY\nA user study with eighteen users was conducted to measure the\ngaming experience measures. The participants consisted of seven\nfemales and eleven males with ages ranging between 19 and 22.\nUser study sessions were spread across 21 days and depending on\nthe skill of the participant, completion times ranged from 35 to 90\nminutes.\nThe user study sessions were carried out by the second author\nand participants were observed from behind in a quiet room\nwithout interruptions (see Figure 7). The computer specifications\nwere an AMD 64 3500+ Processor, 1GB PC 3200 Crucial Ballastix\nRAM, Nvidia GeForce 6800 GT graphics card with Samsung\nSyncMaster 710N monitor, Logitech MX518 mouse, Nvidia\nnForce Onboard Audio with Sennheiser HDR 130 headphones and\na standard keyboard.\nFigure 7: A participant in the user study.\n4.1 Procedure\nA pre-session questionnaire was completed by all participants col-\nlecting demographic data, their perceived skill level at computer\ngames, their game playing habits and general computer usage data.\nA consent form was also signed by all participants. Participants\nwere unpaid.\nEach participant had one attempt at each of the three environ-\nments, starting with Game1, followed by the navigation task virtual\nenvironment and finally Game2, the FPS game. Participants were\nprovided with written instructions, including interface control de-\ntails, for each environment.\nIn Game1, participants had one game, consisting of three lives,\ni.e. three misses of the ball. The ball was fired using the spacebar\nwhilst the paddle was controlled using a mouse.\nIn the test virtual environment, the instructions for the naviga-\ntion tasks were provided in the environment as notice boards on the\nwalls. After the final task, participants completed a questionnaire\non their satisfaction with the virtual environment interface, realism\nof the environment and engagement with the tasks.

There were four gaming metrics collected; from pre-\nsession questionnaires, (i) participants perceived skill level at com-\nputer games, (ii) the number of years of gaming experience, and\nfrom performance metrics from the two example computer games,\n(iii) the score from Game1 (Breakout) and (iv) the stage reached\nfrom Game2 (Escape from Quarantine). A summary of the mean\ndata from these four metrics is shown in Table 1.\nA Spearman Rank correlation7 was performed on these four met-\nrics and the only significant correlation was between perceived skill\nlevel and Game2 stage reached (rs = 0.905, p < 0.001). None of\nthe participants perceived themselves as expert gamers, although\nten participants perceived themselves as being above the mean level\nof the study, i.e. above 3.22.\nA history of gaming habits and in particular, preference for game\ngenre was collected from participants. Participants were asked\nwhich game genres (see Table 2) they played regularly, i.e. 2 or\nmore times a week, within the past 3 years. Feng et al. [10] clas-\nsified inexperienced players as reporting no video game playing in\nthe last 3 years or more. We are using this 3 year period as one\nmeasure to indicate gamer\/non-gamer distinction.\nAs FPS gamers typically play regularly8, a Mann-Whitney U\ntest9 was performed to determine whether playing FPS games had\na significant effect on perceived skill level (U = 1.00, p < 0.01),\nGame1 score (U = 24.00, p < 0.05) and Game2 stage reached (U =\n2.50, p < 0.01).\nAs shown by Figure 8, participants who played FPS games in\nthe past 3 years performed significantly better in both games and\n7Noted in remainder of this paper as rs.\n8Feng et al. [10] classified experienced players as playing for 4 or more\nhours per week.\n9Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test for assessing whether\ntwo samples come from the same distribution.\nFigure 8: The effect of FPS experience on the gaming metrics.\nperceived themselves as having higher skills.\n5.2 Navigation Task Performance\n5.2.1 Spatial Perception (Task 1)\nFor Task 1 (see Section 3.1.4), participants walked through an alley-\nway and were then asked to identify the path they had taken. Each\npath was assigned a score indicating the degree of path complexity\nperceived by each participant. A -1 indicated they perceived a less\ncomplex path, a 0 indicated the correct path, and 1 or 2 indicated\nmore complex path perception.\nThe only significant correlation with any of the gaming metrics\nwas with the number of years a participant had been playing games\n(rs = 0.787, p < 0.01). Interestingly, as shown by Figure 9, this\nwould suggest that participants who have played games for more\nthan 10 years tend to overcomplicate their spatial perception of an\nenvironment.\nFigure 9: Significant correlation between Task 1 score and number\nof years of gaming experience.\n5.2.2 Na\u0131\u00a8ve Search (Task 2)\nFor Task 2, participants were asked to find the exit in a maze as fast\nas possible10.\n10NB. One participant\u2019s data was removed due to an excessively large\ncompletion time.\nThe only statistically significant correlations of the gaming met-\nrics with the time of completion metric were negative correlations\nwith Game2 stage reached (rs = \u22120.550, p < 0.05) and perceived\nskill level (rs =\u22120.557, p < 0.05).\nThis suggests that only certain types of gamers are significantly\nfaster at na\u0131\u00a8ve searches, such as gamers with FPS experience in the\npast 3 years. This is supported by Figure 10 in conjunction with a\nMann-Whitney U test that shows FPS experience has a significant\neffect on the time of completion, (U = 34.5, p = 0.027). This agrees\nwith the findings of [11].\nFigure 10: The effect of FPS experience on na\u0131\u00a8ve search time (in\nseconds).\n5.2.3 Primed Search (Task 3)\nFor Task 3, participants were asked to find the exit in the same maze\nas Task 2 as quickly as possible11.\nSignificant correlations of the gaming metrics with the time of\ncompletion metric were negative correlations with Game2 stage\nreached (rs =\u22120.647, p < 0.01) and the perceived skill level (rs =\n\u22120.726, p < 0.01).\nThis also suggests that only certain types of gamers are signifi-\ncantly faster at primed searches, such as gamers with FPS experi-\nence in the past 3 years. Whilst indicated by Figure 11, this was not\nshown statistically (U = 17.0, p = 0.74). It should also be noted that\nthe gap has narrowed between participants with FPS experience and\nthose without between the na\u0131\u00a8ve and primed searches. Whilst most\nparticipants retraced their steps, several participants took a direct\npath to the exit indicating a good sense of spatial orientation. All\nthese participants had FPS experience and perceived themselves as\nhighly skilled.\nWhilst both na\u0131\u00a8ve and primed searches show negative correla-\ntions to perceived gaming ability, the correlation is more significant\nfor the primed search, \u22120.557 and \u22120.726 respectively. This sug-\ngests that users who perform well in games or perceive themselves\nto be good at games will complete both searches in shorter times\nthan others, particularly primed searches.\n5.2.4 Jumping Ability (Task 4)\nTask 4 (see Section 3.1.6) required participants to jump along a\nseries of wooden boards. Metrics were recorded for the amount of\ntime spent on the floor - classified as a mistake.\nThe amount of mistakes recorded had significant negative corre-\nlations with the perceived skill level (rs = \u22120.795, p < 0.01) and\nGame2 stage reached (rs =\u22120.749, p < 0.01).\nA low number of mistakes required skilful use of the controls to\nproduce precise movements and accurate spatial awareness. These\n11The same participant, as in Task 2, was removed due to an excessively\nlarge time of completion.\nFigure 11: The effect of FPS experience on primed search time (in\nseconds).\nare qualities are exhibited mostly by the FPS gamers as confirmed\nby a Mann-Whitney U test (U = 12.0, p = 0.012).\n5.2.5 Travel with Speed and Accuracy (Task 5)\nTask 5 required participants to navigate across a very narrow path\nsuspended above a ravine as quickly as possible. This required high\nspeed and high accuracy travelling ability by the participants.\nThe completion time had significant negative correlations with\nGame1 score (rs =\u22120.542, p < 0.05), Game2 stage reached (rs =\n\u22120.907, p < 0.01) and the perceived skill level (rs = \u22120.836, p <\n0.01).\nAs indicated by Figure 12, FPS gamers clearly completed this\ntype of task with ease compared to the other participants. This is\nconfirmed by a Mann-Whitney U test (U = 5.0, p = 0.002). It is\nlikely that this is because FPS games require highly accurate rapid\nmovements while playing, are generally played frequently, and use\na very similar interface.\nFigure 12: The effect of FPS experience on task 5 completion time\n(in seconds).\nObservations, by the second author, also identified that the per-\nformance depended greatly on the travel technique used. For ex-\nample, FPS gamers moved at a constant speed and hardly looked\ndownwards at their path, even on corners. Conversely, non-FPS\ngamers generally tapped along, looked down often, and attempted\ncorners in small steps. This could suggest that FPS gamers have\nmuch better spatial awareness and may have developed their tech-\nnique from practice. Also practice in such environments may\nhave allowed FPS gamers to develop familiarity with the key-\nboard\/mouse style interface used, leaving them to focus on the im-\nmediate task.\n5.3 Hypotheses Validity\n\u2022 H1 - Participants will exhibit performance in virtual environ-\nment tasks comparative with their performance in computer\ngame environments.\nThis hypothesis was true for Game2 and the virtual environ-\nment navigation tasks, but not for Game1 or the spatial per-\nception task. This is likely due to the fact that the interfaces\nfor the virtual environment navigation tasks and Game2 are\nvery similar in contrast to Game1 which is significantly dif-\nferent.\n\u2022 H2 - Participants with prior computer gaming experience will\nperform better in new computer game and navigation task\nenvironments. These participants should exhibit improved\nspeed, accuracy and spatial-awareness in their interactions.\nStatistical analysis has suggested that this hypothesis is cor-\nrect. This must be taken in context of the limitations of the\nenvironments built for this research. Only two games were\ntested and only five ground-based navigation tasks were con-\nsidered. This has implications for generalising the results to\nother virtual environments, which typically have diverse nav-\nigation and interaction features. It is also likely that the use\nof the same game engine for the FPS game and the navigation\ntask environments will have influenced issues such as inter-\nface interaction, e.g. for keyboard and mouse travel. How-\never, this allowed a number for environment conditions to be\nstandardised between the environments (see Section 3.1) and\nthe tasks in both environments were intentionally developed\nto be dissimilar.\n\u2022 H3 - Participants who play FPS computer games regularly\nwill perform best in all criteria set out by H2 in a virtual en-\nvironment.\nThere is strong evidence that this hypothesis is correct wher-\never H2 is valid.\n5.4 Other Issues\nThe poor correlations shown by the Game1 metric may suggest that\ngeneral hand-eye coordination is not a direct significant factor for\ngaming ability or virtual environment task performance. However,\nthis may have been caused by specific features of the Game1 im-\nplementation. In Game1 each block had a different score, meaning\nstrategy was an important factor. Those participants that were fa-\nmiliar with the game would have had an advantage over those who\nhad not played the game before.\nMetrics of speed were clearly dominated by FPS gamers. This is\nlikely the result of a number of factors. Firstly, FPS gamers practice\noften, and through repeated virtual world exposure have improved\ntheir virtual world navigation skills, particularly for travel, wayfind-\ning and spatial awareness. Secondly, observations during the user\nstudies indicated that FPS gamers were also fastest at doing all of\nthe tasks, which suggests that haste goes hand-in-hand with FPS\ngaming. This is similar to [14] who note that playing action video\ngames enhances players abilities, particularly the number of objects\nthat can be tracked over time through changes in visual short-term\nmemory skills. Also Feng et al. [10] observe that playing action\nvideo games can enhance performance on spatial tasks.\nMost importantly, FPS gamers may be more familiar with a vari-\nety of navigation controls, to the extent that the interaction is trans-\nparent, similar to invisible technology [19, pg75-77]. The technol-\nogy, or in this case the interaction mechanisms, should not intrude\nupon the work of the user. This reduced cognitive load would allow\nFPS gamers to concentrate more on their immediate task. This may\nhave also been a factor in FPS gamers applying more strategy in the\ngames, resulting in better scores and performance.\n6 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has described the effects of gaming experience on vir-\ntual environment evaluations involving navigation tasks. Perceived\ngaming skill and progress in a linear FPS game were found to be the\nmost consistent metrics. Moreover, these metrics gave the best in-\ndication of performance in example virtual environment navigation\ntasks.\nBoth perceived gaming skill and progress in a linear FPS\ngame showed strong significant relations to performance in na\u0131\u00a8ve\nsearches, primed searches, the number of mistakes when perform-\ning an advanced travel technique (jumping) and in travelling time\nrequiring high speed and accuracy.\nIt has been proposed and demonstrated that these relations are\nlargely due to the inclusion of gamers with FPS game experience.\nIt has been suggested that this is because FPS gamers generally play\nfrequently in 3D environments requiring rapid accurate movements,\nwhere they have developed better coordination, movement, spatial\nawareness and navigation abilities. Moreover, interaction with such\ninterfaces becomes familiar and transparent, leaving gamers to fo-\ncus on the immediate task.\nAs prior experience with computer games has been shown to\nhave a marked effect on participants abilities in virtual environ-\nment evaluations it is important to factor such issues into the de-\nsign and procedure of evaluation studies. However, many of the\nresults presented here are defined by a coarse grained distinction\nbetween gamers, non-gamers and FPS gamers. As gaming tech-\nnology becomes more widespread, it will be important to consider\nhow an individual\u2019s prior experiences may be best balanced against\nother participants in order to control bias in evaluation studies. A\nstep toward this will be a more fine grained approach to partici-\npant skill\/ability classification. This may require the development\nof a gamer profile including both similar metrics to those used in\nthis paper, metrics over other 3D interface tasks such as selection\nand manipulation and metrics for subjective conditions such as user\ndisorientation, cybersickness and presence. There is much exist-\ning research literature on these topics and future work will involve\nconsolidating this knowledge, in the context of computer gaming\nexperience, for a gamer profile classification framework.\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.
