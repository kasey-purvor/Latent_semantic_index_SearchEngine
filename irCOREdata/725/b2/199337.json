We develop a methodology for optimal design of financial instruments aimed to hedge some forms of\nrisk that is not traded on financial markets. The idea is to minimize the risk of the issuer under the constraint\nimposed by a buyer who enters the transaction if and only if her risk level remains below a given threshold. Both\nagents have also the opportunity to invest all their residual wealth on financial markets, but with different access\nto financial investments. The problem is reduced to a unique inf-convolution problem involving a transformation\nof the initial risk measures.\nKey words: inf-convolution, risk measure, optimal design, indifference pricing, hedging strategy\nJEL Classification: C61, D81, G13, G22\nMathematics Subject Classification (1991): Primary 60Gxx, 91B28, 91B90; Secondary 46N10\n1 Introduction\nThe past decade has seen the emergence of a range of financial instruments depending on risks traditionally\nconsidered to be within the remit of the insurance sector. Examples are weather and catastrophe claims,\ncontingent on the occurrence of certain weather or catastrophic events. The development of instruments at the\ninterface of insurance and finance raises new questions, not only about their classification but also about their\ndesign, pricing and management. The pricing issue is particularly intriguing as it questions the very logic of\nsuch contracts. Indeed, standard principles for derivatives pricing based on replication do not apply any more\nbecause of the special nature of the underlying risk. On the other hand, the question of the product design,\nunusual in finance, is raised since the logic behind these products is closer to that of an insurance policy.\nThe present paper undertakes the study of these problems in a framework where economic agents may take\npositions on two types of risk: a purely financial risk (or market risk) and a (non-financial) non-tradable risk.\nThe optimal structure of a contract depending on the non-tradable risk and its price are determined. Several\nauthors, notably El Karoui and Rouge (2000), Becherer (2001), Davis (2001) and Musiela and Zariphopoulou\n(2004), have been interested in these new products. As is usual in finance, they focus on the pricing rule of\nthe contracts. Our analysis of insurance-type derivatives is broader, addressing also their impact on \u201dclassical\u201d\ninvestments and their optimal design.\nWe assume that the two parties to the contract, the buyer and the seller, may invest on the financial market,\npossibly with different access to assets. They are assumed to optimize their investment strategies simultaneously\nwith the characterization of the non-tradable structure. Since this structure represents a new diversification\ninstrument for any investor, optimal wealth allocation becomes more complex and the question of efficient\n1L.S.E., Statistics Department, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom.

The framework of this study will be that of recent works by\nArtzner et al. (1999), Fo\u00a8llmer and Schied (2002a, 2002b) and others, who propose axiomatic approaches to the\nconstruction of convex risk measures.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents some results in an exponential utility framework, where\nboth agents have access to a financial market to reduce their risk. Section 3 presents a more general framework\ninvolving convex risk measures and their inf-convolution. In Section 4, we study the impact of both the financial\nmarket and the non-tradable risk on risk measures and give a characterization of the optimal structure, explicitly\nfor a particular family of risk measures and as a necessary and sufficient condition in the general framework.\nTwo examples are given in Section 5, about the hedging issue and the optimality in the inf-convolution problem.\nFinally, in the last section, we present some concluding remarks.\n2 The exponential utility framework\n2.1 A simplified approach: the \u201dtoy model\u201d\n2.1.1 Framework\nTwo economic agents, henceforth calledA andB, are operating in an uncertain universe modeled by a probability\nspace (\u2126,=,P). At a fixed future date T , agent A is exposed to a non-tradable risk for an amount X. In order\nto reduce her exposure, A wants to issue a financial product F and sell it to agent B against a forward price\npi at time T . We assume that X and F belong to X , the linear space of bounded functions including constant\nfunctions. Both agents are supposed to be risk-averse. We assume that they are working with the same kind of\nchoice criterion, an increasing exponential utility function U (x) = \u2212\u03b3 exp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3x\n)\n, x \u2208 R, with risk tolerance\ncoefficients \u03b3A and \u03b3B respectively.\nAgent A\u2019s objective is to choose the optimal structure (F, pi) so as to maximize the expected utility of her final\nwealth, i.e. seeking:\narg supF\u2208X ,pi EP [UA (X \u2212 (F \u2212 pi))] .\nHer constraint is that agent B should have an interest to enter into this transaction. At least, the F -structure\nshould not worsen agent B\u2019s expected utility. Agent B compares two expected utility levels, the first one\ncorresponding to the case where she simply invests her initial wealth in a bank account and the second one to\nthe situation where she enters the F -transaction. Thus, agent A is working under the constraint:\nEP [UB ((F \u2212 pi) + x)] \u2265 EP [UB (x)] ,\nwhere x is the non-risky (forward) wealth of agent B before the F -transaction.\nWith the exponential utility functions, the problem to solve is:\ninfF\u2208X ,pi EP\n[\n\u03b3A exp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3A (X \u2212 (F \u2212 pi))\n)]\nsubject to EP\n[\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3B (F \u2212 pi)\n)]\n\u2264 1 .\n(1)\nGiven the convexity of the program, the constraint is bounded at the optimum and the optimal pricing rule\npi\u2217 (F ) of the financial product F is entirely determined by the buyer as\npi\u2217 (F ) = \u2212\u03b3B lnEP\n(\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\n\u03b3B\nF\n))\n, \u2212e\u03b3B (F ) . (2)\n2\nShe determines the minimal pricing rule, ensuring the existence of the transaction. The price pi\u2217 (F ) corresponds\nto the maximal amount agent B is ready to pay to enter the F -transaction and bear the associated risk. In\nother words, pi\u2217 (F ) corresponds to the certainty equivalent of F for the utility function of agent B, or to the\nindifference pricing rule at which Agent B is indifferent, from her utility point of view, between doing the\nF -transaction and not doing it.\nRemark: i) Exponential utility functions are widely used in the finance literature. Convenient properties of\nexponential utility functions are the absence of constraint on the sign of the future considered cash flows and\ntheir relationship with change in probability measures.\nii) The notion of indifference price has been widely studied in the literature, especially when replicating a\nterminal cash flow using a utility criterion (see for instance, Hodges and Neuberger (1989) or El Karoui and\nRouge (2000)).\niii) The framework we consider is rather standard in insurance policy design (see for instance Raviv (1979)).\n2.1.2 Optimal structure\nIn the present simple framework, henceforth referred to as the \u201dtoy model\u201d, the optimal structure is given by\nthe so-called Borch\u2019s Theorem, presented below. In a quite general utility framework, Borch (1962) obtained\noptimal exchange of risk, leading in many cases to familiar linear quota-sharing of total pooled losses.\nProposition 2.1 (Borch) The optimal structure of the Program (1) is given as a proportion of the initial\nexposure X, depending only on the risk tolerance coefficients of both agents:\nF \u2217 =\n\u03b3B\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B\nX P a.s. (up to a constant) (3)\nProof:\nThe convex constrained Program (1) may be solved by introducing a Lagrangian multiplier \u03bb > 0. The function\nto be minimized is then EP\n[\n\u03b3A exp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3A (X \u2212 (F \u2212 pi))\n)\n\u2212 \u03bb\u03b3B\n(\n1\u2212 exp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3B (F \u2212 pi)\n))]\n.\nFor any scenario \u03c9, the convex function g\n(\n, F \u2212 pi\n)\n7\u2212\u2192 \u03b3A exp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3A (X (\u03c9)\u2212 g)\n)\n\u2212 \u03bb\u03b3B\n(\n1\u2212 exp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3B g\n))\nis minimum at the point g\u2217 satisfying the first order condition exp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3A (X (\u03c9)\u2212 g\u2217)\n)\n= \u03bb exp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3B g\u2217\n)\nor\nequivalently g\u2217 (\u03c9) = F \u2217 (\u03c9) \u2212 pi\u2217 (F \u2217 (\u03c9)) = \u03b3B\u03b3A+\u03b3B (X (\u03c9)\u2212 c (\u03bb)) where c (\u03bb) is given by Equation (2) for\nF \u2217 = \u03b3B\u03b3A+\u03b3BX P a.s. by c (\u03bb) = \u2212 (\u03b3A + \u03b3B) lnEP\n(\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3A+\u03b3BX\n))\n, \u03b3C e\u03b3C (X) with \u03b3C , \u03b3A + \u03b3B . \u0003\n2.1.3 Formulation in terms of certainty equivalent\nLooking at the previous results, the convex entropic functional (this name will be justified later):\n\u2200\u03a8 \u2208 X e\u03b3 (\u03a8) , \u03b3 lnEP\n[\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\n\u03b3\n\u03a8\n)]\n(4)\nplays an important role, especially in characterizing the pricing rule of the structure. It corresponds to the\nopposite of the certainty equivalent of \u03a8.\nOne of its key properties is the translation invariance as\n\u2200m \u2208 R e\u03b3 (\u03a8 +m) = e\u03b3 (\u03a8)\u2212m. (5)\n3\nUsing this functional, the Program (1) may be rewritten as\ninf\nF\u2208X ,pi\ne\u03b3A (X \u2212 (F \u2212 pi)) subject to e\u03b3B ((F \u2212 pi)) \u2264 0. (6)\nUsing the translation invariance property, we find directly the optimal pricing rule as pi\u2217 (F ) = \u2212e\u03b3B (F ).\nMoreover, it is now possible to solve the program without introducing a Lagrangian multiplier since\nEAB (X) , inf\nF\u2208X\ne\u03b3A (X \u2212 (F \u2212 pi (F ))) = inf\nF\u2208X\n(e\u03b3A (X \u2212 F ) + e\u03b3B (F )) . (7)\nGiven the optimal structure F \u2217 previously obtained in Proposition 2.1, the value functional of this program,\nEAB (X), may also be expressed in terms of e\u03b3 and the equality below can be easily obtained:\nEAB (X) = e\u03b3C (X) with \u03b3C = \u03b3A + \u03b3B . (8)\nIt is simply the opposite of the certainty equivalent of X considering a representative agent with an exponential\nutility function and a risk tolerance coefficient equal to \u03b3C .\nRemark: i) The parameter \u03b3C is simply the sum of the risk tolerance coefficients \u03b3A and \u03b3B . This means that\nthe representative agent has a risk tolerance equal to the sum of the risk tolerance of both agents. This justifies\nusing the term risk tolerance instead of risk aversion.\nii) The introduction of the functional e\u03b3 enables us to characterize and interpret very easily the value function\nof the considered program. A direct approach using Subsection 2.1.2 does not lead to such a straightforward\nresult.\n2.2 Investment and diversification in a financial market\nIn order to reduce their risk exposure, both agents may also invest in a financial market. The market plays\na hedging role for the agents. Note that we use the generic terminology \u201dfinancial markets\u201d but it may cover\na more general investment framework, including, for instance, purchase of insurance. The introduction of a\nfinancial market leads to a much more complicated problem even if results will turn out to remain very simple\nand surprisingly robust.\n2.2.1 Hedging portfolios and investment strategies\nIn this paper we do not really need to specify the characteristics of the financial investments. We simply consider\na set VT of bounded terminal gains \u03beT , at time T , resulting from self-financing investment strategies with a\nnull initial value. More precisely, the net potential gain is defined as the spread between the terminal wealth\nresulting from the adopted strategy and the capitalized initial wealth.\nThe key point is that all agents in the market agree on the initial value of these strategies, in other words, the\ninitial market value of any of these strategies is null. In particular, a possible admissible strategy is associated\nwith a derivative contract with bounded terminal payoff \u03a6 only if its forward market price at time T , qm (\u03a6), is\na transaction price for all agents in the market. Then, \u03a6\u2212 qm (\u03a6) is the bounded terminal gain at time T and\nis an element of VT . A typical example of admissible terminal gains \u03beT is then the terminal wealth associated\nwith transactions based on options. Generally, and especially when adopting a dynamic point of view, it is\nnatural to consider terminal gains associated with dynamic investment strategies. A detailed framework will be\nintroduced, when needed in Section 5.\nMoreover, in order to have coherent transaction prices, we assume that the market is arbitrage-free. In our\nframework, it can be expressed by the following condition:\n\u2203Q \u223c P \u2200\u03beT \u2208 VT EQ (\u03beT ) \u2265 0. (9)\n4\nConsidering the traded financial assets, with a terminal payoff \u03a6, such a condition is written as qm (\u03a6) =\nEQ (\u03a6). The probability measure Q may be viewed as a static version of the classical VT -martingale measures\nin a dynamic framework, even if it is not a \u201dstandard\u201d equivalent martingale measure but an equivalent sub-\nmartingale measure in the sense that all hedged positions are positive on average.\n2.2.2 Financial properties of VT and hedging strategies of both agents\nThe set VT , previously defined, has to satisfy some properties to be coherent with certain investment principles.\nThe first principle, being the \u201dminimal assumption\u201d, is the consistency with the diversification principle. In\nother words, any convex combination of admissible gains should also be an admissible gain. Hence, the set VT\nis always taken as a convex set.\nSome additional requirements may be introduced. In particular, if agents are not sensitive to the size of the\ntransactions, VT is assumed to be a cone. Such an assumption is relevant for liquid markets where it is possible\nto make a given order in any quantity. Finally, if agents are not sensitive to the direction of the transactions\n(buy\/sell), VT is a sub-vector space. This assumption is consistent with the most liquid part of the market.\nEven if there exists a unique large underlying financial market, both agents may not have the same access to it.\nIndeed, both agents may be of very different natures a priori. The set of hedging products to which they have\naccess may be different, due to differences in goals and regulatory constraint between e.g. insurance companies,\nreinsurance companies, banks, private investors... The set of admissible strategies for Agent A (resp. Agent B)\nis characterized by the associated terminal gains and is denoted by V(A)T (resp. V(B)T ). The minimal assumption\nis that both V(A)T and V(B)T are convex sets. Some additional assumptions may also be imposed following the\nprevious arguments. Note that the sets V(A)T and V(B)T may have different interpretations: both agents do not\nconsider indeed the financial investments from the same point of view. For Agent A, the problem is to hedge\nher remaining risk. In this sense, V(A)T corresponds to terminal gains associated with hedging strategies. On the\nother hand, Agent B simply wants to make some financial investments. V(B)T is then associated with investment\nstrategies. In the rest of the paper, however, we will not distinguish and refer to both types of strategies as\nhedging strategies.\n2.3 Optimization problem\n2.3.1 Optimization program\nThe impact of the financial market concerns above all agent B. Indeed, since she initially invests on financial\nmarkets, the F -transaction will be of interest to her only if it can increase her expected utility level, taking into\naccount her optimal financial investments. The investor has now a threshold on her hedging strategies. The\nissuer may also invest optimally on the financial market. Therefore, her problem is simply to maximize the\nexpected utility of her global terminal wealth. In other words, the optimization program is\nsup\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T\nEP [UA (X \u2212 (F \u2212 pi)\u2212 \u03beA)]\ns.t. sup\n\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\nEP [UB ((F \u2212 pi) + x\u2212 \u03beB)] \u2265 sup\u03beB\u2208V(B)T EP [UB (x\u2212 \u03beB)]\nor equivalently, using the convex entropic functional e\u03b3 previously defined by Equation (4)\ninfF\u2208X ,pi inf\u03beA\u2208V(A)T\ne\u03b3A (X \u2212 (F \u2212 pi)\u2212 \u03beA)\ns.t. inf\n\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ne\u03b3B ((F \u2212 pi)\u2212 \u03beB) \u2264 inf\u03beB\u2208V(B)T e\u03b3B (\u2212\u03beB) .\n(10)\n5\nAssumption: In the following, we assume that\ninf\n\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ne\u03b3B (\u2212\u03beB) > \u2212\u221e and inf\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T\ne\u03b3A (\u2212\u03beA) > \u2212\u221e.\nSuch a condition guarantees that, for any \u03a8 \u2208 X , inf\n\u03bei\u2208V(i)T\ne\u03b3i (\u03a8\u2212 \u03bei) is finite, for both i = A,B. Indeed, the\nfunctional e\u03b3 is decreasing and \u03a8 is bounded by \u2212\u2016\u03a8\u2016\u221e and \u2016\u03a8\u2016\u221e, where \u2016\u03a8\u2016\u221e = inf{c > 0 ,P(|\u03a8| > c) = 0}.\nTherefore, using the cash translation invariance property, we obtain \u2212\u2016\u03a8\u2016\u221e + e\u03b3i (\u2212\u03bei) = e\u03b3i (\u2016\u03a8\u2016\u221e \u2212 \u03bei) \u2264\ne\u03b3i (\u03a8\u2212 \u03bei) \u2264 e\u03b3i (\u2212\u2016\u03a8\u2016\u221e \u2212 \u03bei) = e\u03b3i (\u2212\u03bei) + \u2016\u03a8\u2016\u221e. Taking the infimum leads to the result.\n2.3.2 Optimal pricing rule\nThe optimal pricing rule is obtained, as previously, by binding the constraint imposed by the buyer at the\noptimum and using the cash translation invariance property of the functional e\u03b3\npi\u2217 (F ) = inf\n\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ne\u03b3B (\u2212\u03beB)\u2212 inf\n\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ne\u03b3B (F \u2212 \u03beB) . (11)\nThe previous comment ensures that the optimal price is finite for any F in X .\nThe optimal pricing rule corresponds to an indifference price since it makes the investor, agent B, indifferent\nbetween doing or not doing the F -transaction. The formulation is less direct than that of the \u201dtoy model\u201d\n(Equation (2)) as it involves optimal investments on financial markets. Note also that, as previously, the\nexponential utility makes the initial wealth x irrelevant for the pricing rule.\n2.3.3 Relationship with the \u201dtoy model\u201d\nUsing the optimal pricing rule and the translation invariance property of the functional e\u03b3 , the optimization\nProgram (10) may be rewritten as\nEmAB (X) = inf\nF\u2208X\n(\ninf\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T\ne\u03b3A (X \u2212 F \u2212 \u03beA) + inf\n\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ne\u03b3B (F \u2212 \u03beB)\n)\n. (12)\nThis optimization Program looks very similar to the previous optimization problem (7), referred to as \u201dtoy\nmodel\u201d, when no hedging strategy is available. The only difference comes from the accrued complexity\ne\u03b3A (X \u2212 F ) and e\u03b3B (F ) with inf\u03beA\u2208V(A)T e\u03b3A (X \u2212 F \u2212 \u03beA) and inf\u03beB\u2208V(B)T e\u03b3B (F \u2212 \u03beB). A first natural choice\nto solve this problem is therefore to study the functional \u03a8 7\u2212\u2192 inf\u03be\u2208VT e\u03b3 (\u03a8\u2212 \u03be). This method is not so easy\nand not so efficient as the one we choose to present here... But it was our first approach! The nature of the\nmodified functional \u03a8 7\u2212\u2192 inf\u03be\u2208VT e\u03b3 (\u03a8\u2212 \u03be) will be studied in details in the next sections, in reference to the\npricing via utility maximization in incomplete markets.\nThe following Proposition and its proof present some additional simplifications that can be made:\nProposition 2.2 The value functional of the Program (12), EmAB (X), is equal to the value functional of\ninf\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T ,\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ne\u03b3C (X \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB) with \u03b3C = \u03b3A + \u03b3B . (13)\nProof:\nThe Program (12) is a succession of three minimizations:\nEmAB (X) = inf\nF\u2208X ,\u03beA\u2208V(A)T ,\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\n(e\u03b3A (X \u2212 F \u2212 \u03beA) + e\u03b3B (F \u2212 \u03beB)) .\n6\nHence, choosing the order of minimization, we obtain\nEmAB (X) = inf\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T ,\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ninf\nF\u2208X\n(e\u03b3A (X \u2212 F \u2212 \u03beA) + e\u03b3B (F \u2212 \u03beB)) .\nUsing a translation of \u03beB and letting F\u02dc , F \u2212 \u03beB \u2208 X enables us to rewrite it as\nEmAB (X) = inf\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T ,\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ninf\nF\u02dc\u2208X\n(\ne\u03b3A\n(\nX \u2212 F\u02dc \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB\n)\n+ e\u03b3B\n(\nF\u02dc\n))\n. (14)\nThis new Program is closely related to the \u201dtoy model\u201d. The intermediate optimization program\ninf\nF\u02dc\u2208X\n(\ne\u03b3A\n(\nX \u2212 F\u02dc \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB\n)\n+ e\u03b3B\n(\nF\u02dc\n))\n= EAB (X \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB)\ncorresponds indeed to the toy model (Equation (7)) with the initial risk exposure X \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB instead of X\nand the structure F\u02dc to be determined. Hence, using the previous result on the value functional of the toy\nmodel problem (see Equation (8)), inf F\u02dc\u2208X\n(\ne\u03b3A\n(\nX \u2212 F\u02dc \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB\n)\n+ e\u03b3B\n(\nF\u02dc\n))\n= e\u03b3C (X \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB). Hence,\nas a consequence of Equation (14), the value functional of the optimization Program (12) is also given by\ninf\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T ,\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ne\u03b3C (X \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB). \u0003\n2.4 Optimal structure\nConsidering the right order of minimization, as presented in Proposition 2.2, is crucial since it reduces consid-\nerably the difficulties of solving. However, in order to solve completely the intermediate optimization problems,\nwe have to use the reverse approach, starting from the global hedging problem and then deriving the optimal\nstructure and the individual hedging problems. More precisely, the first problem to be solved is the \u201dglobal\nhedging problem\u201d, which is more or less classical:\nEmAB (X) = inf\u03beA\u2208V(A)T ,\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ne\u03b3C (X \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB) def= inf\u03be\u2208V(AB)T e\u03b3C (X \u2212 \u03be) (PAB)\nwith \u03be = \u03beA + \u03beB \u2208 V(AB)T\ndef\n= V(A)T + V(B)T .\nIts originality comes from the relative complexity of the set of admissible financial strategies we consider. To\ncharacterize the optimal structure, we first suppose that the Program (PAB) has an optimal solution \u03be\u2217 \u2208\nV(A)T +V(B)T , in other words that there exists a decomposition (not necessarily unique) of \u03be\u2217 over V(A)T and V(B)T .\nTheorem 2.3 Suppose \u03be\u2217 = \u03b7\u2217A + \u03b7\n\u2217\nB is an optimal solution of the Program (PAB) with \u03b7\u2217A \u2208 V(A)T and \u03b7\u2217B \u2208\nV(B)T . Then\nF \u2217 =\n\u03b3B\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B\nX \u2212 \u03b3B\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B\n\u03b7\u2217A +\n\u03b3A\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B\n\u03b7\u2217B\nis an optimal structure. It characterizes a Pareto-optimal exchange of risk. Moreover,\ni) \u03b7\u2217B is an optimal investment portfolio for Agent B;\n1\n\u03b3B\ne\u03b3B (F\n\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7\u2217B) =\n1\n\u03b3B\ninf\n\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ne\u03b3B (F\n\u2217 \u2212 \u03beB) = 1\n\u03b3C\ne\u03b3C (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) .\nii) \u03b7\u2217A is an optimal hedging portfolio of (X \u2212 F \u2217) for Agent A;\n1\n\u03b3A\ne\u03b3A (X \u2212 (F \u2217 + \u03b7\u2217A)) =\n1\n\u03b3A\ninf\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T\ne\u03b3A (X \u2212 (F \u2217 + \u03beA)) =\n1\n\u03b3C\ne\u03b3C (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) .\n7\nWe give here a detailed proof of this result which will be used later in Theorem 4.2 in a more general context.\nProof: To prove this theorem, we proceed in several steps:\nStep 1:\nLet us first observe that EmAB (X) = e\u03b3C (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) = inf F\u02dc\u2208X\n(\ne\u03b3A\n(\nX \u2212 F\u02dc \u2212 \u03be\u2217\n)\n+ e\u03b3B\n(\nF\u02dc\n))\ngiven Proposi-\ntion 2.2. Using the \u201dtoy model\u201d optimality result (Proposition 2.1), we obtain directly an expression for the\noptimal \u201dstructure\u201d F\u02dc \u2217 as: F\u02dc \u2217 = \u03b3B\u03b3A+\u03b3B (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) =\n\u03b3B\n\u03b3C\n(X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) and e\u03b3B\n(\nF\u02dc \u2217\n)\n= \u03b3B\u03b3C e\u03b3C (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217).\nStep 2:\nRewriting in the reverse order the arguments used in the proof of Proposition 2.2, we naturally set F \u2217 = F\u02dc \u2217+\u03b7\u2217B .\nWe then want to prove that \u03b7\u2217B is an optimal investment for agent B.\nFor the sake of simplicity in our notation, we consider GX (\u03beA, \u03beB , F ) , e\u03b3A (X \u2212 F \u2212 \u03beA) + e\u03b3B (F \u2212 \u03beB).\nGiven the optimality of \u03be\u2217 = \u03b7\u2217A + \u03b7\n\u2217\nB and F\u02dc\n\u2217 = F \u2217 \u2212 \u03b7\u2217B , we have\nEmAB (X) = G\nX (\u03b7\u2217A, \u03b7\n\u2217\nB , F\n\u2217)\n= inf\nF\u2208X ,\u03beA\u2208V(A)T ,\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\nGX (\u03beA, \u03beB , F ) \u2264 inf\n\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\nGX (\u03b7\u2217A, \u03beB , F\n\u2217) \u2264 GX (\u03b7\u2217A, \u03b7\u2217B , F \u2217) .\nThen \u03b7\u2217B is optimal for the problem e\u03b3B (F \u2212 \u03beB)\u2192 inf\u03beB\u2208V(B)T . The optimality of \u03b7\n\u2217\nA can be proved using the\nsame arguments.\nStep 3: Pareto optimality\nAssume that a structure F \u2217A improves the situation of agent A: e\u03b3A (X \u2212 F \u2217A \u2212 \u03b7\u2217A) < e\u03b3A (X \u2212 F \u2217 \u2212 \u03b7\u2217A).\nGiven the optimality of (\u03b7\u2217A, \u03b7\n\u2217\nB , F\n\u2217), we have GX (\u03b7\u2217A, \u03b7\n\u2217\nB , F\n\u2217\nA) \u2265 GX (\u03b7\u2217A, \u03b7\u2217B , F \u2217)and then e\u03b3B (F \u2217A \u2212 \u03b7\u2217B) \u2265\ne\u03b3B (F\n\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7\u2217B). Consequently, if agent A improves her situation, agent B worsens hers, and vice versa. This is\nexactly the definition of Pareto-optimality. \u0003\nQuestion of uniqueness:\n(1) Assume that \u03be\u2217 has two distinct decompositions, \u03be\u2217 = \u03b7\u2217A + \u03b7\n\u2217\nB = \u03b7\n\u2217\nA + \u03b7\n\u2217\nB , over V(A)T + V(B)T , then it\nadmits an infinity of decompositions, since any convex combination of these decompositions is also an admissible\ndecomposition due to the convexity of both sets V(A)T and V(B)T . Hence there exists an infinity of optimal\nstructures: \u03b3B\u03b3A+\u03b3B (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) + (\u03b2\u03b7\u2217B + (1\u2212 \u03b2) \u03b7\u2217B) (\u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1]).\n(2) Assume that both V(A)T and V(B)T are cones. We write \u03be\u2217 as \u03be\u2217 = \u03b7A+\u03b7B+\u03baAB where \u03baAB is an element\nof V(A)T \u2229V(B)T . Then, another possible decomposition is \u03be\u2217 = \u03b7\u03b1A+ \u03b7\u03b1B considering \u03b7\u03b1A = (1\u2212 \u03b1) \u03b7A+\u03b1\u03baAB and\n\u03b7\u03b1B = \u03b1\u03b7B + (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03baAB for any \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\nIn this case, F \u2217 = \u03b3B\u03b3A+\u03b3B (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) + \u03b7\u03b1B is an optimal structure. Choosing 1 \u2212 \u03b1 =\n\u03b3B\n\u03b3A+\u03b3B\nleads to F \u2217 =\n\u03b3B\n\u03b3A+\u03b3B\n(X \u2212 \u03b7A \u2212 \u03b7B). There is no influence of the common financial market through \u03baAB .\n(3) Assume now that both V(A)T and V(B)T are vector spaces. Considering two decompositions \u03b7\u2217A + \u03b7\u2217B and\n\u03b7\u2217A + \u03b7\n\u2217\nB of \u03be\n\u2217, we obtain \u03b7\u2217B \u2212 \u03b7\u2217B = \u2212 (\u03b7\u2217A \u2212 \u03b7\u2217A) \u2208 V(A)T \u2229 V(B)T and it is then possible to generate an infinity\nof optimal structures by simply adding elements of V(A)T \u2229 V(B)T .\n(4) Note finally that even if there is an infinity of optimal structures, the terminal wealth of agent B is\nuniquely determined for any optimal solution \u03be\u2217 of the global hedging problem and equal to \u03b3B\u03b3A+\u03b3B (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217).\nThe previous Theorem has two corollaries, corresponding to two particular situations:\nCorollary 2.4 (Non-speculative Logic) Suppose V(A)T = V(B)T and there is an optimal solution of the Pro-\ngram (PAB). Then,\nF \u2217 =\n\u03b3B\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B\nX\n8\nis an optimal structure.\nProof:\nIf V(A)T = V(B)T = VT , then \u03be\u2217 = \u03b3A\u03b3A+\u03b3B \u03be\u2217+\n\u03b3B\n\u03b3A+\u03b3B\n\u03be\u2217 is an optimal decomposition, where \u03b3A\u03b3A+\u03b3B \u03be\n\u2217 and \u03b3B\u03b3A+\u03b3B \u03be\n\u2217\nare elements of VT since VT is a convex set and 0 \u2208 VT . \u0003\nWhen both agents have the same access to the financial market, the underlying logic of the transaction is\nnon-speculative as the issuer has an interest to sell a structure if and only if she is initially exposed (or, more\nprecisely, if her initial exposure differs from that of the buyer). The underlying logic is that of insurance and\nhedging. This Corollary gives an extension of the classical Borch\u2019s Theorem to the situation where an investment\nalternative is available for the agents.\nCorollary 2.5 Suppose there is an optimal solution of the Program (PAB) which may be decomposed over V(A)T\nand V(B)T . If Agent A is not initially exposed (X \u2261 0), there is still a transaction if both agents have different\naccess to the financial market.\nWhen both agents do not have the same access to the financial market, a transaction may still take place if the\nissuer is not initially exposed. This may be an opportunity for either agent to buy some derivative products\nin the other agent\u2019s market to which she may not have direct access. The underlying logic may be in this\nsense no longer non-speculative. Both agents can exchange some financial portfolios (of their own market) in a\nway proportional to their relative risk tolerance. Their own financial market portfolio plays the same role as a\nnon-tradable asset for the other agent. The question of optimal hedging portfolios will be tackled naturally in\nthe more general framework of convex risk measures where arguments are identical. As a consequence, we leave\nit to Subsection 5.1.\nThe obtained results depend neither on the modeling of the financial investment gain processes nor on the\ndistribution of the non-financial risk. In this sense, they are extremely robust. They do however seem to be\nhighly dependent on the entropic choice criterion. Therefore, a natural question is how these results extend to\nother risk criteria. This is the topic of the following sections.\n3 Risk measures: basic properties and new developments\nAs noticed in the previous section, the right framework to work with is that of the functional e\u03b3 . This enables us\nto define an entropic risk measure with certain key properties like convexity, monotonicity and cash translation\ninvariance. In the rest of the paper, we will work on the possible extensions of these results to a more general\nframework of risk measures holding these properties. We will obtain an extraordinary robustness of the results\nin the exponential utility framework. In this section, we define and present the general framework we adopt in\nthe next sections. First, we introduce a general class of risk measures introduced by Fo\u00a8llmer and Schied (2002a)\nand (2002b) to measure the risk of both agent\u2019s exposure. Then, we generate new risk measures as solution of\nan inf-convolution problem and finally derive the main results which enable us to re-formulate in Section 4 the\noptimal structure problem into a very simple convex problem.\n3.1 Convex risk measures\n3.1.1 Definition and properties\nWe first recall the definition and some key properties of the convex risk measures introduced by Fo\u00a8llmer and\nSchied (2002a) and (2002b). As before, X denotes a linear space of bounded functions including constant\nfunctions.\n9\nDefinition 3.1 The functional\n\u03c1 : X \u2192 R ; \u03a8\u2192 \u03c1 (\u03a8)\nis a convex risk measure if, for any X and Y in X , it satisfies the following properties:\na) Convexity: \u2200\u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] \u03c1 (\u03bbX + (1\u2212 \u03bb)Y ) \u2264 \u03bb\u03c1 (X) + (1\u2212 \u03bb) \u03c1 (Y );\nb) Monotonicity: X \u2264 Y \u21d2 \u03c1 (X) \u2265 \u03c1 (Y );\nc) Translation invariance: \u2200m \u2208 R \u03c1 (X +m) = \u03c1 (X)\u2212m.\nIntuitively, \u03c1 (\u03a8) may be interpreted as the amount the agent has to hold to completely cancel the risk associated\nwith her risky position \u03a8\n\u03c1 (\u03a8 + \u03c1 (\u03a8)) = 0. (15)\nThe axiomatic approach to risk measures has been first introduced by Artzner et al. (1999). They consider\ncoherent risk measures, satisfying the previous three properties of convexity, monotonicity and translation in-\nvariance, together with an positive homogeneity property : \u2200\u03a8 \u2208 X , \u2200\u03bb \u2265 0, \u03bdH (\u03bb\u03a8) = \u03bb\u03bdH (\u03a8).\nThis simply translates the fact that the size of the transaction or exposure does not have any particular impact.\n(For more details, please refer to Fo\u00a8llmer and Schied (2002b), Remark 4.13).\nExample 3.2 A classical example of convex risk measure is the entropic risk measure e\u03b3 , defined in the previous\nsection as \u2200\u03a8 \u2208 X e\u03b3 (\u03a8) = \u03b3 lnEP\n(\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3\u03a8\n))\n.\nRemark: A risk measure \u03c1 satisfying the three axioms a), b) and c) in Definition 3.1 is finite for any \u03a8 \u2208 X\nas soon as \u03c1 (0) is finite. Indeed, any element of X is a bounded random variable. So, for any \u03a8 \u2208 X there\nexist two real numbers m and M such that m \u2264 \u03a8 \u2264M . Hence, using the monotonicity property of \u03c1, we have\n\u221e > \u03c1 (m) \u2265 \u03c1 (\u03a8) \u2265 \u03c1 (M) > \u2212\u221e provided that \u03c1 (0) is finite. This property will be useful in the following,\nespecially when generating new risk measures.\nThe duality between X and the set M1,f of all additive measures on (\u2126,F) leads to the dual representation of\nconvex risk measures as presented by Fo\u00a8llmer and Schied (2002b) (Theorem 4.12):\nTheorem 3.3 The dual characterization of the convex risk measure is given in terms of a penalty function,\n\u03b1 (Q) taking values in R \u222a {+\u221e}:\n\u2200\u03a8 \u2208 X \u03c1 (\u03a8) = sup\nQ\u2208M1,f\n{EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03b1 (Q)} . (16)\nBy duality between M1,f and X ,\n\u2200Q\u2208M1,f \u03b1 (Q) = sup\n\u03a8\u2208X\n{EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03c1 (\u03a8)} (\u2265 \u2212\u03c1 (0)) . (17)\nMoreover, the supremum is attained in M1,f and\n\u2200\u03a8 \u2208 X \u03c1 (\u03a8) = max\nQ\u2208M1,f\n{EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03b1 (Q)} .\nThis last result is important as it ensures the existence of an \u201doptimal\u201d additive measure.\nIn the following, we are especially interested in risk measures related to probability measures. We make the\nassumption of continuity from above in the sense that:\n\u03a8n \u2198 \u03a8 \u21d2 \u03c1 (\u03a8n)\u2197 \u03c1 (\u03a8) , (18)\n10\nwhich is equivalent to lower semicontinuity with respect to bounded pointwise convergence (Lemma 4.16, Fo\u00a8llmer\nand Schied (2002b)).\nThis assumption implies that the dual formulation of risk measure (Equation (16)) is satisfied for Q \u2208 M1,\nwhereM1 is the set of all probability measures on the considered space. In this case, Equation (17) concerning\nthe penalty function still holds if we replace M1,f by M1. When working with M1, the supremum is attained\nunder some conditions presented in Theorem 4.22 of Fo\u00a8llmer and Schied (2002b). In the present paper, for the\nsake of simplicity and clarity, we use the notation Q when dealing with additive measures and Q when dealing\nwith probability measures.\nExample 3.4 The dual formulation of the functional e\u03b3 justifies the name of entropic risk measure since\n\u2200\u03a8 \u2208 X , e\u03b3 (\u03a8) = \u03b3 lnEP\n(\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\n\u03b3\n\u03a8\n))\n= sup\nQ\u2208M1\n(EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03b3h (Q\/P)) ,\nwhere h (Q\/P) is the relative entropy of Q with respect to the prior probability P, defined by\nh (Q\/P) = EP\n(\ndQ\ndP\nln\ndQ\ndP\n)\nif Q\u001c P and +\u221e otherwise.\n3.1.2 Risk measure generated by a convex set\nAcceptance set and generation of convex risk measures From the definition of the convex risk measure\n\u03c1 and the duality relationship with the penalty function, it is natural to define the acceptance set A\u03c1 related to\n\u03c1 as the set of all acceptable positions carrying no positive risk:\nA\u03c1 = {\u03a8 \u2208 X , \u03c1 (\u03a8) \u2264 0} . (19)\nIt has the following properties:\n(i) A\u03c1 is a non-empty convex set and inf {m \u2208 R;m \u2208 A\u03c1} > \u2212\u221e,\n(ii) For any X \u2208 A\u03c1 and any Y \u2208 X , Y \u2265 X \u21d2 Y \u2208 A\u03c1,\n(iii) A\u03c1 has a closure property in the sense that for any X \u2208 A\u03c1 and any Y \u2208 X ,\n{\u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] , such that \u03bbX + (1\u2212 \u03bb)Y \u2208 A\u03c1} is closed in [0, 1] . (20)\nAs a direct consequence of Equation (15), the risk measure \u03c1 and the penalty function \u03b1 may be expressed in\nterms of A\u03c1 as\n\u03c1 (\u03a8) = inf {m \u2208 R;m+\u03a8 \u2208 A\u03c1} (21)\nand\n\u2200Q\u2208M1,f \u03b1 (Q) = sup\n\u03a8\u2208A\u03c1\nEQ (\u2212\u03a8) . (22)\nIt is possible to consider the relationship (21) between \u03c1 and A\u03c1 as a definition of the risk measure \u03c1 and then,\nto extend it to general convex set in order to generate particular convex risk measures.\nDefinition 3.5 Given a non-empty convex subset of X , H, we define\n\u03bdH (\u03a8) = inf {m \u2208 R; such that \u2203\u03be \u2208 H, m+\u03a8 \u2265 \u03be} .\nIf \u03bdH (0) > \u2212\u221e, \u03bdH is a convex risk measure and the related acceptance set is defined by\nAH = {\u03a8 \u2208 X ,\u2203\u03be \u2208 H, \u03a8 \u2265 \u03be} .\n11\nThe associated penalty function lH is given by\n\u2200Q\u2208M1,f lH (Q) = sup\nH\u2208H\nEQ (\u2212H) .\nWhen H is a cone, the penalty function associated with \u03bdH is the indicator function of the cone\nMH = {Q \u2208M1,f ;\u2200\u03be \u2208 H, EQ (\u03be) \u2265 0}\nin the sense of the convex analysis (see Rockafellar (1970)):\nlH (Q) = \u03b4 (Q | MH) =\n{\n0 if Q\u2208MH\n+\u221e otherwise.\nThe risk measure \u03bdH is then coherent and its dual formulation is simply given by\n\u2200\u03a8 \u2208 X \u03bdH (\u03a8) = sup\nQ\u2208MH\nEQ (\u2212\u03a8) .\nInterpretation in terms of buyer\u2019s price The risk measure generated by H can be given another interpre-\ntation. Considering any \u03be \u2208 H as a hedging strategy, \u03bdH (\u03a8) corresponds indeed to the opposite of the buyer\u2019s\nprice of \u03a8. The buyer of \u03a8 is satisfied by a strategy (x, \u03be) such that \u03a8 \u2265 x+ \u03be. For a given \u03be, the buyer always\nconsiders the worst case, corresponding to the maximal amount x such that \u03a8 \u2265 x+ \u03be:\npib (\u03a8) = sup {x \u2208 R,\u2203\u03be \u2208 H, \u03a8 \u2265 x+ \u03be} .\nConsequently, the arg sup is the maximal price the buyer is willing to pay for \u03a8 and may be seen as the\nequivalent for the buyer of the super-replicating price for the seller. Given that \u03bdH is defined by \u03bdH (\u03a8) =\ninf {m \u2208 R,\u2203\u03be \u2208 H, \u03a8+m \u2265 \u03be}, we finally obtain that the risk measure of \u03a8 is the opposite of the \u201dsuper\nbuyer\u2019s price\u201d of \u03a8:\n\u03bdH (\u03a8) = \u2212pib (\u03a8) .\nIn a very general framework of a convex risk measure \u03c1, p (\u03a8) , \u2212\u03c1 (\u03a8) may also be interpreted as a price. It\ncorresponds indeed to the (capitalized) \u201dindifference\u201d buyer\u2019s price which leaves the agent indifferent between\nbuying \u03a8 for a price p and doing nothing since \u03c1 (\u03a8\u2212 p (\u03a8)) = \u03c1 (\u03a8) + p (\u03a8) = \u03c1 (\u03a8)\u2212 \u03c1 (\u03a8) = 0.\n3.2 Inf-convolution of risk measures\n3.2.1 Main results\nFo\u00a8llmer and Schied proved that the supremum of a sequence of convex risk measures is also a convex risk\nmeasure (Proposition 4.15 in Fo\u00a8llmer and Schied (2002b)).\nThe Theorem below gives another stability property of convex risk measures and their penalty functions. The\nnotations we use are those of Rockafellar (1970).\nTheorem 3.6 Let \u03c11 and \u03c12 be two convex risk measures with penalty functions \u03b11 and \u03b12 respectively. Let\n\u03c11,2 be the inf-convolution of \u03c11 and \u03c12 defined as\n\u03a8\u2192 \u03c11,2 (\u03a8) , \u03c11\u0003\u03c12 (\u03a8) = inf\nH\u2208X\n{\u03c11 (\u03a8\u2212H) + \u03c12 (H)} ,\n12\nand assume that \u03c11,2 (0) > \u2212\u221e. Then \u03c11,2 is a convex risk measure, which is finite for all \u03a8 \u2208 X . Moreover, if\n\u03c11 is continuous from below, then \u03c11,2 is also continuous from below. The associated penalty function is given\nby\n\u2200Q\u2208M1,f \u03b11,2 (Q) = \u03b11 (Q) + \u03b12 (Q) .\nThe related acceptance set A\u03c11,2 is the \u201dpseudo-closure\u201d of A\u03c11 + A\u03c12 (in the sense of Fo\u00a8llmer and Schied\n(2002b) Proposition 4.5)\nNote that the convex risk measure \u03c11,2 may also be defined as the value functional of the program\n\u03c11,2 (\u03a8) = inf {\u03c11 (\u03a8\u2212H) ,H \u2208 A\u03c12} .\nAn immediate consequence is:\nCorollary 3.7 Let H be a convex subset of X , and let \u03c1 be a convex risk measure with penalty function \u03b1 such\nthat inf {\u03c1 (\u2212H) ,H \u2208 H} > \u2212\u221e. Then the inf-convolution of \u03c1 and \u03bdH,\n\u03c1H (\u03a8) , \u03c1\u0003\u03bdH (\u03a8) = inf {\u03c1 (\u03a8\u2212H) ,H \u2208 H} , (23)\nis a convex risk measure with penalty function \u2200Q\u2208M1,f \u03b1H (Q) = \u03b1 (Q) + lH (Q).\nIf H is a cone, then \u03c1H has the penalty function \u03b1H (Q) = \u03b1 (Q) if Q \u2208MH and +\u221e otherwise.\nProof:\nWe need only to prove the equality \u03c1H (\u03a8) = inf {\u03c1 (\u03a8\u2212H) ,H \u2208 H}. By definition, \u03c1H (\u03a8) , \u03c1\u0003\u03bdH (\u03a8) =\ninf\u03a6\n{\n\u03c1 (\u03a8\u2212 \u03a6) + \u03bdH (\u03a6)} = inf {\u03c1 (\u03a8\u2212 \u03a6) ;\u03a6 \u2208 AH}. But for any \u03a6 \u2208 AH, there exists H \u2208 H such\nthat \u03a6 \u2265 H and so \u03c1 (\u03a8\u2212 \u03a6) \u2265 \u03c1 (\u03a8\u2212H) since \u03c1 is decreasing.

The reverse inequality is immediate as H \u2282 AH. \u0003\nProof of Theorem 3.6:\ni) The monotonicity and translation invariance properties of \u03c11,2 are immediate.\nii) The convexity simply comes from the fact that, for any \u03a81, \u03a82, H1 and H2 in X and any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the\nfollowing inequalities hold as \u03c11 and \u03c12 are convex risk measures:\n\u03c11 [\u03bb\u03a81 + (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03a82 \u2212 (\u03bbH1 + (1\u2212 \u03bb)H2)] \u2264 \u03bb\u03c11 (\u03a81 \u2212H1) + (1\u2212 \u03bb) \u03c11 (\u03a82 \u2212H2)\n\u03c12 [\u03bbH1 + (1\u2212 \u03bb)H2] \u2264 \u03bb\u03c12 (H1) + (1\u2212 \u03bb) \u03c12 (H2) .\nBy adding the inequalities and taking the infimum over H1 and H2 on the left-hand side and in H1 on the\nright-hand side, we obtain:\n\u03c11\u0003\u03c12 (\u03bb\u03a81 + (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03a82) \u2264 \u03bb\u03c11\u0003\u03c12 (\u03a81) + (1\u2212 \u03bb) (\u03c11 (\u03a82 \u2212H2) + \u03c12 (H2)) .\nTaking then the infimum over H2 on the right-hand side yields the convexity inequality for \u03c11,2.\niii) The continuity from below is directly obtained upon considering an increasing sequence of (\u03a8n) \u2208 X\nconverging to \u03a8. Using the monotonicity property, we have\ninf\nn\n\u03c11\u0003\u03c12 (\u03a8n) = inf\nn\ninf\nH\n{\u03c11 (\u03a8n \u2212H) + \u03c12 (H)}\n= inf\nH\ninf\nn\n{\u03c11 (\u03a8n \u2212H) + \u03c12 (H)} = inf\nH\n{\u03c11 (\u03a8\u2212H) + \u03c12 (H)}\n= \u03c11\u0003\u03c12 (\u03a8) .\n13\niv) The assumption \u03c11,2 (0) > \u2212\u221e guarantees that \u03c11,2 (\u03a8) is finite for any \u03a8 \u2208 X , as previously mentioned.\nv) Using Equation (17), the associated penalty function of any Q\u2208M1,f is given by\n\u03b11,2 (Q) = sup\u03a8\u2208X {EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03c11,2 (\u03a8)} = sup\u03a8\u2208X {EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 infH\u2208X {\u03c11 (\u03a8\u2212H) + \u03c12 (H)}}\n= sup\u03a8\u2208X supH\u2208X {EQ (\u2212 (\u03a8\u2212H)) + EQ (\u2212H)\u2212 \u03c11 (\u03a8\u2212H)\u2212 \u03c12 (H)} .\nLetting \u03a8\u02dc , \u03a8\u2212H \u2208 X , and recalling that X is the set of all bounded random variables, we obtain\n\u03b11,2 (Q) = sup\n\u03a8\u02dc\u2208X\nsup\nH\u2208X\n(\nEQ\n(\n\u2212\u03a8\u02dc\n)\n\u2212 \u03c11\n(\n\u03a8\u02dc\n)\n+ EQ (\u2212H)\u2212 \u03c12 (H)\n)\n= sup\nH\u2208X\n[\nEQ (\u2212H)\u2212 \u03c12 (H) + sup\n\u03a8\u02dc\u2208X\n(\nEQ\n(\n\u2212\u03a8\u02dc\n)\n\u2212 \u03c11\n(\n\u03a8\u02dc\n))]\n= sup\nH\u2208X\n[EQ (\u2212H)\u2212 \u03c12 (H) + \u03b11 (Q)] ,\nif \u03b11 (Q) = +\u221e, then \u03b11,2 (Q) = +\u221e.

Both are convex sets.\nHowever, A\u03c11 +A\u03c12 does not necessarily satisfy the closure property (20). \u0003\n3.2.2 Dilatation of convex risk measures and semi-group properties\nIn this subsection, we present an example of risk measure transformation which is stable by inf-convolution and\nsatisfies a dilatation property with respect to the size of the position.\nDefinition 3.8 Let \u03c1 be a convex risk measure with penalty function \u03b1 and \u03b3 > 0 a real parameter called the\nrisk tolerance coefficient. The dilated risk measure \u03c1\u03b3 , associated with \u03c1 and \u03b3, is defined by\n\u2200\u03a8 \u2208 X \u03c1\u03b3 (\u03a8) = \u03b3\u03c1\n(\n1\n\u03b3\n\u03a8\n)\n.\nThe associated penalty function is \u2200Q\u2208M1,f \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3 (Q) = \u03b3\u03b1 (Q).\n14\nNote that the entropic functional e\u03b3 is the dilated risk measure associated with the convex risk measure e1. In\nthis entropic case, this dilatation property has been referred to as volume scaling by Becherer (2003).\nMoreover, as noticed when studying the \u201dtoy model\u201d, the inf-convolution of two entropic risk measures is again\nan entropic risk measure. The risk tolerance coefficient of the latter is simply the sum of the two risk tolerance\ncoefficients (see Equation (8)). In other words, a stability property holds for entropic risk measures for any\n(\u03b3, \u03b3\u2032), strictly positive: e\u03b3\u0003e\u03b3 = e\u03b3+\u03b3\u2032 . Such a property still holds for general dilated risk measures:\nTheorem 3.9 Let (\u03c1\u03b3 , \u03b3 > 0) be the family of \u03c1-dilated risk measures. Then, the following properties hold:\ni) For any \u03b3, \u03b3\n\u2032\n> 0, \u03c1\u03b3\u0003\u03c1\u03b3\u2032 = \u03c1\u03b3+\u03b3\u2032 ,\nii) Moreover, F \u2217 = \u03b3\n\u2032\n\u03b3+\u03b3\u2032\nX is an optimal structure for the minimization program:\n\u03c1\u03b3+\u03b3\u2032 (X) = \u03c1\u03b3\u0003\u03c1\u03b3\u2032 (X) = inf\nF\n{\u03c1\u03b3 (X \u2212 F ) + \u03c1\u03b3\u2032 (F )} = \u03c1\u03b3 (X \u2212 F \u2217) + \u03c1\u03b3\u2032 (F \u2217) .\niii) Let \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 be two convex risk measures.\nThen, for any \u03b3 > 0, \u03c1\u03b3\u0003\u03c1\u2032\u03b3 = (\u03c1\u0003\u03c1\u2032)\u03b3 .\nProof:\nBoth i) and iii) are immediate consequences of the definition and the characterization of dilated risk measures.\nii) Let us search for the optimal structure in the family {\u03b1X;\u03b1 \u2208 R}. Then,\n\u03c1\u03b3 ((1\u2212 \u03b1)X) + \u03c1\u03b3\u2032 (\u03b1X) = \u03b3\u03c1\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b1\n\u03b3\nX\n)\n+ \u03b3\n\u2032\n\u03c1\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03b3\u2032\nX\n)\n= (\u03b3 + \u03b3\u2032) .\u03c1\n(\n1\n\u03b3 + \u03b3\u2032\nX\n)\n.\nA natural candidate is then obtained for 1\u2212\u03b1\u03b3 X =\n\u03b1\n\u03b3X =\n1\n\u03b3+\u03b3\u2032X. Hence the result.\u0003\nMoreover, the following asymptotic properties hold for dilated risk measures, extending the entropic framework\n(see for instance, El Karoui-Rouge (2000) (Theorem 5.2) and Becherer (2003) (Proposition 3.2)).\nProposition 3.10 i) \u03c1 is a coherent risk measure if and only if \u03c1\u03b3 \u2261 \u03c1\nii) Suppose that \u03c1 (0) = 0. Then, \u03c1\u221e , lim\u03b3\u2192\u221e \u03c1\u03b3 is a coherent risk measure and \u03c1\u221e (\u03a8) =\nsupQ\u2208M1,f\n\u03b1(Q)=0\nEQ (\u2212\u03a8) .\niii) Moreover, \u03c10 , lim\u03b3\u21920 \u03c1\u03b3 is simply the \u201dsuper-pricing rule\u201d of \u2212\u03a8: \u03c10 (\u03a8) = supQ\u2208M1,f\n\u03b1(Q)<\u221e\nEQ (\u2212\u03a8) .\nProof:\ni) comes immediately from the definition and characterization of both coherent risk measures and dilated risk\nmeasures.\nii) Let us first observe that \u03c1\u03b3 is a decreasing function of \u03b3. This monotonicity property comes from the\ndual representation of convex risk measures together with the expression of the penalty function of dilated risk\nmeasure.\nThe risk measure corresponding to an infinite risk tolerance, \u03c1\u221e , lim\u03b3\u2192\u221e \u2193 \u03c1\u03b3 , is a coherent risk measure\nsince:\n\u03b3\u03c1\u221e\n(\n1\n\u03b3\n\u03a8\n)\n= \u03b3 lim\nc\u2192\u221e\n(\n\u03c1c\n(\n1\n\u03b3\n\u03a8\n))\n= \u03b3 lim\nc\u2192\u221e\n(\nc\u03c1\n(\n1\n\u03b3c\n\u03a8\n))\n= \u03c1\u221e (\u03a8) .\nMoreover, since\n\u2200Q \u2208M1,f \u03b1\u221e (Q) = sup\n\u03a8\n{EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03c1\u221e (\u03a8)} \u2265 sup\n\u03a8\n{EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03c1\u03b3 (\u03a8)} = \u03b1\u03b3 (Q) = \u03b3.\u03b1 (Q) ,\n15\nwe have \u03b1\u221e (Q) =\u221e if \u03b1 (Q) > 0, hence \u03c1\u221e (\u03a8) = supQ\u2208M1,f\n\u03b1(Q)=0\nEQ (\u2212\u03a8).\niii) By monotonicity, denoting by Q\u03b1 = {Q \u2208M1,f ;\u03b1 (Q) <\u221e}, we obtain:\n\u03c10 (\u03a8) = lim\u03b3\u21920 \u2191 \u03c1\u03b3 (\u03a8) = sup\u03b3 sup{Q;\u03b1(Q)<\u221e} {EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03b3\u03b1 (Q)} = supQ\u03b1 sup\u03b3 {EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03b3\u03b1 (Q)} =\nsupQ\u03b1 EQ (\u2212\u03a8). \u0003\n4 Optimal design problem\nThis Section is dedicated to our initial problem of characterizing the optimal issue written on the non-tradable\nrisk in the general framework presented above.\n4.1 Framework\nIn this section, we come back to our initial problem of optimal transaction between agent A and agent B\ndescribed in Subsection 2.1.1: At a fixed future date T , agent A is exposed towards a non-tradable risk for an\namount X. To reduce her exposure, she wants to issue a financial product F and sell it to agent B for a forward\nprice at time T denoted by pi. Both agents now assess the risk associated with their respective positions by a\nconvex risk measure, denoted by \u03c1A and \u03c1B (with penalty functions \u03b1A and \u03b1B , respectively).\nAs previously described (Subsection 2.2), both agents may reduce their risk by also investing in the financial\nmarket, choosing optimally their financial investments via, in general, two convex sets V(A)T and V(B)T .\n1. The opportunity to invest optimally in a financial market reduces the risk of both agents. To as-\nsess their respective risk exposure, they now refer to a market modified risk measure defined by\ninf\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T\n\u03c1A (\u03a8\u2212 \u03beA) , \u03c1mA (\u03a8) and inf\u03beB\u2208V(B)T \u03c1B (\u03a8\u2212 \u03beB) , \u03c1\nm\nB (\u03a8). We also make the standard as-\nsumption\n\u03c1mA (0) > \u2212\u221e and \u03c1mB (0) > \u2212\u221e. (24)\nGiven Corollary 3.7, we introduce the risk measures generated by both convex sets V(A)T and V(B)T , denoted\nrespectively by \u03bdA and \u03bdB . Then, \u03c1mA and \u03c1\nm\nB correspond to the inf-convolution between the initial risk\nmeasures and the risk measures generated by the financial markets: for i = A,B, \u03c1mi (\u03a8) = \u03c1i\u0003\u03bdi (\u03a8).\n2. Consequently, the optimization program related to the F -transaction is simply\ninf\nF\u2208X ,pi\n\u03c1mA (X \u2212 F + pi) subject to \u03c1mB (F \u2212 pi) \u2264 \u03c1mB (0) .\nAs previously, using the cash translation invariance property and binding the constraint at the optimum,\nthe pricing rule of the F -structure is fully determined by the buyer as\npi\u2217 (F ) = \u03c1mB (0)\u2212 \u03c1mB (F ) . (25)\nIt corresponds to an \u201dindifference\u201d pricing rule from the point of view of agent B\u2019s market modified risk\nmeasure.\n3. Using again the cash translation invariance property, the optimization program reduces to\ninf\nF\u2208X\n(\u03c1mA (X \u2212 F ) + \u03c1mB (F )\u2212 \u03c1mB (0)) .\n16\nWe are almost in the framework of Theorem 3.6, apart from the constant \u03c1mB (0). Noticing that the value\nfunctional obtained in this case should be translated by the constant \u2212\u03c1mB (0) in order to obtain the value\nfunction of the previous program, we consider the reduced program\nRmAB (X) = inf\nF\u2208X\n(\u03c1mA (X \u2212 F ) + \u03c1mB (F )) = \u03c1mA\u0003\u03c1mB (X) = \u03c1A\u0003\u03bdA\u0003\u03c1B\u0003\u03bdB (X) . (26)\nThe value functionalRmAB of this program, resulting from the inf-convolution of four different risk measures,\nmay be interpreted as the residual risk measure after all transactions.\n4. Using the previous Theorem 3.6 on the stability of convex risk measure, RmAB (X) is a convex risk measure\nwith the penalty function \u03b1mAB (Q) = \u03b1\nm\nA (Q) + \u03b1\nm\nB (Q) = \u03b1A (Q) + \u03b1B (Q) + l\nA (Q) + lB (Q).\nNote that the financial market plays exactly the same role as an intermediate agent imposing some\nconstraint on the considered agent. As a consequence, we end up with four different risk measures, two\nfor each agent.\n4.2 Dilated risk measures and Borch\u2019s Theorem\nOur problem is to construct optimal structures. We have already solved it completely in the entropic framework\n(assuming the solution of the hedging problem). In that case, the existence of a solution is ensured. In the\ngeneral case, it may be more of a problem. However, in the particular case when both agents have the same\ntype of risk measure, with possibly different risk tolerances, everything becomes very simple as we will see in\nthe following. Thus, we consider the situation where both agents have dilated initial risk measures, \u03c1A and \u03c1B .\nIn this sense, we may say that the framework is symmetric for both agents.\nThe residual risk measure RmAB (X) may be simplified using the commutativity property of the inf-convolution\nand the semi-group property of dilated risk measures:\nRmAB (X) = \u03c1A\u0003\u03bdA\u0003\u03c1B\u0003\u03bdB (X) = \u03c1A\u0003\u03c1B\u0003\u03bdA\u0003\u03bdB (X) , \u03c1C\u0003\u03bdA\u0003\u03bdB (X) , (27)\nwhere \u03c1C is the dilated risk measure associated with the risk tolerance coefficient \u03b3C = \u03b3A + \u03b3B .\nWe present two results depending on the access both agents have to the financial markets. The proofs will be\npresented in the next section, when some general results on optimality in inf-convolution problems are derived.\n4.2.1 Borch\u2019s Theorem\nLet us first assume that both agents have the same access to the financial market via a cone H. Given the fact\nthat the risk measure generated by H is coherent and thus invariant by dilatation, the market modified risk\nmeasures of both agents are dilated from \u03c1\u0003\u03bdH as \u03c1i\u0003\u03bdH = \u03c1i\u0003\u03bdH\u03b3i =\n(\n\u03c1\u0003\u03bdH\n)\n\u03b3i\nfor i = A,B.\nHence, using Equation (27), we have RmAB (X) =\n(\n\u03c1\u0003\u03bdH\n)\n\u03b3C\n. Using Theorem 3.9, we find again the so-called\nBorch\u2019s theorem:\nProposition 4.1 If both agents have dilated risk measures and have the same access to the financial market\nvia a cone, then an optimal structure, solution of the minimization Program (26) is given by:\nF \u2217 =\n\u03b3B\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B\nX.\n17\n4.2.2 Different access to hedging strategies\nIn a more general framework, when both agents have different access to the financial market, we may use\nthe same arguments as in the entropic framework, after some transformation. By Equation (27), RmAB (X) =\n\u03c1C\u0003\u03bdA\u0003\u03bdB (X), and using the properties of the inf-convolution,\nRmAB (X) = inf\n\u03beB\u2208V(B)T\ninf\n\u03beA\u2208V(A)T\n\u03c1C (X \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB) = inf\n\u03beA+\u03beB\u2208V(A)T +V(B)T\n\u03c1C (X \u2212 \u03beA \u2212 \u03beB) , inf\n\u03be\u2208V(A)T +V(B)T\n\u03c1C (X \u2212 \u03be) .\nThen, RmAB (X) is very similar to the residual risk measure in the entropic framework, E\nm\nAB (X), given as the\nvalue functional of the Program (PAB). As a consequence, the following result is very similar to Theorem 2.3.\nThe proof, consisting of three main steps, has been detailed in Subsection 2.1.2. It does not use the explicit\nformulation of the entropic risk measure and can be directly extended to the general framework.\nTheorem 4.2 Suppose \u03be\u2217 = \u03b7\u2217A + \u03b7\n\u2217\nB is an optimal solution of the Program inf\u03be\u2208V(A)T +V(B)T\n\u03c1C (X \u2212 \u03be) with\n\u03b7\u2217A \u2208 V(A)T and \u03b7\u2217B \u2208 V(B)T .

This extends the results obtained in the entropic framework of Section 2. The regulator has to\nimpose very different rules on agents as to generate risk measures with non-proportional penalty functions if she\nwants to increase the diversification in the market. In other words, diversification occurs when agents are very\ndifferent. Such a result supports, for instance, the intervention of reinsurance companies on financial markets\nin order to increase diversification.\n4.3 Characterization of the optimal structure in the general framework\nWe now consider the general framework where the problem is to find a structure F \u2217 optimizing the Program\n(26): RmAB (X) = infF {\u03c1mA (X \u2212 F ) + \u03c1mB (F )}. Let us first introduce two definitions of optimality and make\nprecise the dual relationship between exposure and additive measure:\nDefinition 4.3 Given a convex risk measure \u03c1 and its associated penalty function \u03b1, we say that\ni) the additive measure Q\u03a8\u03c1 is optimal for (\u03a8, \u03c1) if \u03c1 (\u03a8) = supQ\u2208M1,f {EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03b1 (Q)} = EQ\u03a8\u03c1 (\u2212\u03a8) \u2212\n\u03b1\n(\nQ\u03a8\u03c1\n)\n.\nii) The exposure \u03a8 is optimal for (Q, \u03b1) if \u03b1 (Q) = sup\u03a6\u2208X {EQ (\u2212\u03a6)\u2212 \u03c1 (\u03a6)} = EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03c1 (\u03a8),\niii) and a sequence (\u03a8n) is maximizing for (Q, \u03b1) if supn {EQ (\u2212\u03a8n)\u2212 \u03c1 (\u03a8n)} = sup\u03a6\u2208X {EQ (\u2212\u03a6)\u2212 \u03c1 (\u03a6)}.\n18\nTheorem 4.4 The necessary and sufficient condition for F \u2217 to be an optimal solution to the inf-convolution\nprogram RmAB (X) = infF {\u03c1mA (X \u2212 F ) + \u03c1mB (F )} is that there exists an optimal additive measure QXAB for\n(X,RmAB) such that F\n\u2217 is optimal for\n(\nQXAB , \u03b1\nm\nB\n)\nand X \u2212 F \u2217 is optimal for (QXAB , \u03b1mA ).\nMore generally, (Fn) is a minimizing sequence for the inf-convolution problem if and only if (Fn) is a maximizing\nsequence for\n(\nQXAB , \u03b1\nm\nB\n)\nand (X \u2212 Fn) is a maximizing sequence for\n(\nQXAB , \u03b1\nm\nA\n)\n.\nNote that everything relies upon the existence of an optimal additive measure QXAB for R\nm\nAB (X). As\nmentioned in Subsection 3.1.1, the existence of such an additive measure is guaranteed as soon as the\npenalty function is defined by (22). When working with probability measures M1, the supremum \u03c1 (\u03a8) =\nsupQ\u2208M1 {EQ (\u2212\u03a8)\u2212 \u03b1 (Q)} is attained under some topological conditions obtained by Fo\u00a8llmer and Schied\n(2002b) (Theorem 4.22 ). It may be worth noticing however that if one of the risk measures involved in the\ninf-convolution is continuous from below, then the optimal additive measure of the inf-convolution is in fact\n\u03c3-additive.\nProof:\nIn the proof, we denote by \u03a8c, the centered random variable \u03a8 with respect to the given additive measure QXAB\noptimal for (X,RmAB): \u03a8\nc = \u03a8\u2212 EQXAB (\u03a8). So, by definition,\n\u2212RmAB (Xc) = \u03b1mA\n(\nQXAB\n)\n+ \u03b1mB\n(\nQXAB\n)\n= sup\nF\u2208X\n{\u2212\u03c1mA (Xc \u2212 F c)}+ sup\nF\u2208X\n{\u2212\u03c1mB (F c)}\n\u2265 \u2212 inf\nF\u2208X\n{\u03c1mA (Xc \u2212 F c) + \u03c1mB (F c)} = \u2212RmAB (Xc) .\nIn particular, all inequalities are equalities and\nsup\nF\u2208X\n{\u2212\u03c1mA (Xc \u2212 F c)}+ sup\nF\u2208X\n{\u2212\u03c1mB (F c)} = sup\nF\u2208X\n{\u2212\u03c1mA (Xc \u2212 F c)\u2212 \u03c1mB (F c)} .\nIt follows that F \u2217 is optimal for the inf-convolution problem, or equivalently for the program on the right-\nhand side of this equality, if and only if F \u2217 is optimal for the two problems supF\u2208X {\u2212\u03c1mB (F c)} and\nsupF\u2208X {\u2212\u03c1mA (Xc \u2212 F c)}.\nMore generally, the same argument holds for any minimizing sequence for the inf-convolution problem, (Fn),\nsuch that there exists \u03b5 > 0 and\n\u2212\u03c1mA (Xc \u2212 F cn) + (\u2212\u03c1mB (F cn)) + \u03b5 \u2265 \u2212RmAB (Xc) = sup\nF\u2208X\n{\u2212\u03c1mA (Xc \u2212 F c)}+ sup\nF\u2208X\n{\u2212\u03c1mB (F c)}\nand similarly \u2212\u03c1mB (F cn) + \u03b5 \u2265 supF\u2208X {\u2212\u03c1mB (F c)}. Then, (Fn) is a maximizing sequence for the two problems\nsupF\u2208X {\u2212\u03c1mB (F c)} and supF\u2208X {\u2212\u03c1mA (Xc \u2212 F c)}. The converse is obvious. \u0003\nOptimal hedge. Let us now illustrate this theorem via the issue of hedging. Let H be a cone of bounded\nvariables. We introduce the generated coherent risk measure \u03bdH as in Definition 3.5 and its acceptance set\nAH = {\u03a8;\u2203H \u2208 H \u03a8 \u2265 H}. The penalty function of the risk measure \u03bdH is the indicator function (in the\nsense of the convex analysis) of the set MH = {Q \u2208M1,f ;\u2200H \u2208 H EQ (H) \u2265 0}.\ni) Let \u03c1 be a convex risk measure and \u03c1H its inf-convolution with \u03bdH as introduced in Corollary 3.7.\nLet Q\u2217 be an optimal additive measure for\n(\nX, \u03c1H\n)\n. Given the fact that \u03b1H (Q) is finite if and only if Q \u2208MH,\nwe immediately obtain that Q\u2217 \u2208 MH. Using Theorem 4.4, we obtain the following characterization of the\noptimal structure G\u2217 for the inf-convolution problem: G\u2217 is optimal if and only if the three following properties\nhold : G\u2217 \u2208 H, EQ\u2217 (G\u2217) = 0 and \u03b1 (Q\u2217) = supG (\u2212\u03c1 (Xc \u2212Gc)) = \u2212\u03c1 (Xc \u2212G\u2217).\nProof:\n19\nBy Theorem 4.4, G\u2217 is optimal if and only if G\u2217 \u2208 H and \u03b1 (Q\u2217) = \u2212\u03c1H (Xc) = \u2212\u03c1 (Xc \u2212G\u2217c).\nThe facts\nthat \u2200H \u2208 H, EQ\u2217 (H) \u2265 0 and \u2212\u03c1H (Xc) = supH\u2208H (\u2212\u03c1 (Xc \u2212H)) = supH\u2208H (\u2212\u03c1 (Xc \u2212Hc)\u2212 EQ\u2217 (H))\nimply that EQ\u2217 (G\u2217) = 0. \u0003\nii) When \u03c1 is the entropic risk measure with the penalty function \u03b3h (Q\/P), an optimal hedge \u03a8\u2217 satisfies the\nthree properties obtained above. More precisely: \u03a8\u2217 \u2208 H, EQ\u2217 (\u03a8\u2217) = 0 and \u03b3h (Q\u2217\/P) = \u2212e\u03b3 (Xc \u2212\u03a8\u2217).\nEquivalently, dQ\n\u2217\ndP =\n1\nk exp\u2212\n(\n\u03a8\u2217\u2212X\n\u03b3\n)\n.\nNecessarily, an optimal probability measure is equivalent to P and has a finite relative entropy with respect\nto P. We will come back to this particular question in Subsection 5.2. We will then prove that under some\nadditional assumption, this condition is also sufficient for optimality.\n5 Optimality in the inf-convolution problem: some examples\nWe now study the hedging problem through its related inf-convolution problem. We consider first a general\nframework of convex risk measure and then come back to the hedging problem in the entropic framework. This\nquestion has been widely studied in the literature under the name of \u201dhedging in incomplete markets and pricing\nvia utility maximization\u201d in some particular frameworks. Most of the studies have considered exponential utility\nfunctions. Among the numerous papers, we may quote the papers by Frittelli (2000), El Karoui-Rouge (2000),\nDelbaen et al. (2002), Kabanov-Stricker (2002) or the PhD dissertation of Becherer (2001).\n5.1 Some existence results for the hedging problem\nWe are interested here in solving the following inf-convolution problem (P):\ninf\n\u03be\u2208VT\n\u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03be) ,\nwhere VT is a convex set of bounded variables and \u03c1 is a convex risk measure, continuous from below.\nPreliminary results The existence of a solution to this problem is closely related to the following properties\nof the functional \u03c1:\n\u03be \u2192 \u03c1 (\u03be) is convex and decreasing ; if \u03ben \u2191 \u03be, \u03c1 (\u03ben) \u2193 \u03c1 (\u03be) and if \u03ben \u2193 \u03be, \u03c1 (\u03be) \u2191 \u03c1 (\u03be) (28)\nWe assume that for any elements (X,Y ) \u2208 X 2 such that for X = Y P a.s. \u03c1 (X) = \u03c1 (Y ).\nThen the properties given by Equation (28) are also true when considering almost surely convergence.\nMoreover, a key argument in the proof of the existence of a solution relies upon the following version of the\nKomlos Theorem (Komlos (1967)):\nTheorem 5.1 (Komlos) Let (\u03c6n) be a sequence in L1 (P) such that supn EP (|\u03c6n|) < +\u221e. Then there exists\na subsequence (\u03c6n\u2032) of (\u03c6n) and a function \u03c6\u2217 \u2208 L1 (P) such that for every further subsequence (\u03c6n\u2032\u2032) of (\u03c6n),\nlimN\u2192\u221e 1N\nN\u2211\nn\u2032\u2032=1\n\u03c6n\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) = \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c9) for almost every \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126.\nWe are able to present the following theorem on existence:\n20\nTheorem 5.2 Assume inf\u03be\u2208VT \u03c1 (\u03be) > \u2212\u221e.\ni) Let VT be a convex set, bounded in L\u221e (P), of bounded random variables \u03be.\nThe infimum of the hedging program\n\u03c1m (X) , inf\n\u03be\u2208VT\n\u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03be)\nis attained for a random variable \u03be\u2217 in L\u221e (P), belonging to the closure of VT with respect to the a.s. convergence.\nii) When VT = V(A)T + V(B)T with V(A)T and V(B)T convex and bounded in L\u221e (P), the infimum of the hedging\nprogram\n\u03c1m (X) , inf\n\u03b7A\u2208V(A)T ,\u03b7B\u2208V(B)T\n\u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03b7A \u2212 \u03b7B)\nis attained for \u03be\u2217 = \u03b7\u2217A + \u03b7\n\u2217\nB where \u03b7\n\u2217\nA and \u03b7\n\u2217\nB belong to the a.s. closure of V(A)T and V(B)T .\nProof:\nNote first that the proof of this theorem relies on arguments similar to those used by Kabanov and Stricker\n(2002).\ni) Let (\u03ben \u2208 VT ) be a minimizing sequence for the hedging program \u03c1m (X) , inf\u03be\u2208VT \u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03be) such that\n\u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03ben) tends to \u03c1m (X). Given the assumption that (\u03ben) is a L\u221e-bounded sequence, we can apply Theorem\n5.1. Therefore, there exists a subsequence (\u03bejk \u2208 VT ) such that the Cesaro-means, \u03be\u02dcn , 1n\nn\u2211\nk=1\n\u03bejk converges\nalmost surely to \u03be\u2217 \u2208 L\u221e (P). Note that \u03be\u02dcn belongs to VT as a convex combination of elements of VT . So \u03be\u2217\nbelongs to the a.s. closure of VT .\nSince \u03c1 is decreasing and stable by monotone convergence,\nlim\nn\nsup \u03c1\n(\nX \u2212 \u03be\u02dcn\n)\n\u2264 \u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) = \u03c1\n(\nlim\nn\n(\nX \u2212 \u03be\u02dcn\n))\n\u2264 lim\nn\ninf \u03c1\n(\nX \u2212 \u03be\u02dcn\n)\n.\nThen, \u03c1m (X) \u2264 \u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) \u2264 limn inf \u03c1\n(\n1\nn\nn\u2211\nk=1\n(X \u2212 \u03bejk)\n)\n\u2264 limn inf 1n\nn\u2211\nk=1\n\u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03bejk) by Jensen\u2019s inequality.\nFinally, given the convergence of \u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03bejk) to \u03c1m (X), \u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) = inf\u03be\u2208VT \u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03be).\nii) Suppose now that the convex space VT = V(A)T + V(B)T where V(A)T and V(B)T are bounded in L\u221e (P).\nUsing the same arguments, we can select step by step a sequence (\u03ben = \u03b7nA + \u03b7\nn\nB) converging almost surely,\na Cesaro subsequence\n(\n\u03be\u02dcn\n)\nconverging almost surely to \u03be\u2217, then two new Cesaro subsequences (\u03b7\u02dcnA) and\n(\u03b7\u02dcnB) such that (\u03b7\u02dc\nn\nA) converges almost surely to \u03b7\n\u2217\nA. This implies that\n(\n\u03b7\u02dcnB = \u03be\u02dcn \u2212 \u03b7\u02dcnA\n)\nalso converges al-\nmost surely to \u03b7\u2217B = \u03be\n\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7\u2217A. The rest of the proof relies on the same arguments as in i). Finally,\n\u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03be\u2217) , inf\n\u03b7A\u2208V(A)T ,\u03b7B\u2208V(B)T\n\u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03b7A \u2212 \u03b7B) = \u03c1 (X \u2212 \u03b7\u2217A \u2212 \u03b7\u2217B). \u0003\n5.2 Dynamic hedging in the hedging framework\nWe now consider the global hedging problem in the entropic framework when the set of admissible gains VT is\nrelated to dynamic strategies. In this case, solving directly the primal problem (P) may be difficult. It is easier\nto work with its dual formulation. We will recall some classical results of the literature, which are useful for\nour problem.\nVT as a set of dynamic financial strategies The framework we now consider is general but standard (see,\nfor instance Delbaen-Schachermayer (1994)). The basic financial assets are evaluated by their forward price at\ntime T denoted by S. The process (St; t \u2208 [0, T ]) is assumed to be a vector (P\u2212=t)-semi-martingale, locally\n21\nbounded, where (=t; t \u2208 [0, T ]) is a filtration on (\u2126,=,P) satisfying the usual conditions of right-continuity and\ncompleteness. In particular, S may be a discontinuous vector process, with bounded jumps.\nWe now introduce some convenient notation. In particular, the following sets of probability measures are im-\nportant: Pa , {Q,Q\u001c P, S is a (Q,=t) -local martingale}, Pe , {Q,Q \u223c P, S is a (Q,=t) -local martingale}\nand Pf , {Q \u2208Pa, h (Q\/P) <\u221e}. In the literature, the assumption, implying no-arbitrage, Pe \u2229 Pf 6= \u2205, is\nmade.\nThe self-financing strategies are predictable processes, \u03c6, such that their stochastic integrals with respect to S\nare well-defined and bounded from below at any time t, t \u2208 [0, T ]. Using some simplified notation, we introduce\nthe following set of admissible strategies: \u03a6M = {(\u03c6) admissible ; \u03c6.S is a (Q,=t) -martingale for all Q \u2208Pf}\nand denote the associated set of terminal gains by G\u03a6M =\n{\n\u03beT ; \u03beT =\n\u222b T\n0\n\u03c6tdSt ; (\u03c6) \u2208 \u03a6M\n}\n. The set VT we\nnow consider is defined as VT = G\u03a6M \u2229 X .\nHence, VT satisfies some key properties essential to solve completely the hedging problem. It is not however\nthe minimal set of terminal gains. Several authors have studied in detail the question of the minimal space of\nadmissible strategies and the dual formulation of the hedging problem, see in particular Delbaen et al. (2002).\nOptimal entropic probability measure and global hedging portfolio When considering a dynamic\npresentation of the financial market, we may obtain more accurate results on the optimal hedging strategy.\nBecherer (2003) proposes a clear formulation of some results of the literature in Proposition 2.2, as presented\nbelow:\nProposition 5.3 Assume that\nH1) S is a locally bounded semi-martingale.\nH2) Pe \u2229 Pf 6= \u2205.\nH3) The random variable X is bounded.\nH4) The following duality property inf\u03be\u2208VT \u03b3 lnEP\n(\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3 (\u03be +X)\n))\n= supQ\u2208Pa (EQ (\u2212X)\u2212 \u03b3.h (Q\/P))\nholds for any X \u2208 X and any \u03b3 > 0.\nThen,\ni) there exists a unique probability measure QX \u2208 Pe \u2229 Pf , such that\nsup\nQ\u2208Pf\n(EQ (\u2212X)\u2212 \u03b3 h (Q\/P)) = EQX (\u2212X)\u2212 \u03b3 h\n(\nQX\/P\n)\n.\nii) The density of QX is given by dQ\nX\ndP = c. exp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3\n(\nT\u222b\n0\n\u2329\n\u03c6Xs , dSs\n\u232a\n+X\n))\nwhere c is a normalizing constant,\nT\u222b\n0\n\u2329\n\u03c6Xs , dSs\n\u232a\n, \u03beX \u2208 VT and \u03c6X \u2208 \u03a6M .\niii) Moreover, the following duality result holds: \u03b3 lnEP\n(\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\u03b3 (\u03beX +X)\n))\n= EQX (\u2212X)\u2212 \u03b3.h\n(\nQX\/P\n)\n.\nReinterpretation in terms of previous results Proposition 5.3 can be reinterpreted in terms of the\nprevious results obtained when applying Theorem 4.4 to the question of optimal hedge (Subsection 4.3). Thus,\n\u03beX is the optimal hedge while QX is the optimal probability measure for (X, e\u03b3). Note that the properties of\nthe optimal hedge, obtained in Subsection 4.3, are also found here. In particular, EQX (\u03beX) = 0 since \u03c6X .S is a\nQX -martingale.\nDecomposition As already mentioned in Section 2, the global hedging problem to be solved is (PAB).\nIn this particular dynamic framework, it is not a restrictive assumption to consider that agent A has access to a\n22\nparticular set of financial assets SA whereas agent B has access to a set SB . We only consider financial assets,\nthat at least one of the agents has access to. In others words, the set of basic financial assets is S = SA \u222a SB .\nThese assets have a forward price process S =\n(\nSA, SB\n)\u2032\nwith obvious notations. Note that if there are some\ncommon components, they are not repeated. The program (PAB) is first solved under the assumptions of\nProposition 5.3. In particular, assumption (H4) holds for VT = V(AB)T = V(A)T + V(B)T .\nIt simply remains to decompose the vector process \u03c6X \u2208 \u03a6M into two components over the respective sets of\nassets SA and SB after having noticed that the set of admissible strategies associated with SA (resp. SB) is\nincluded in \u03a6M .\nComment on the literature Proposition 5.3 of Becherer (2003) is very close to the results of Delbaen et al.\n(2002), Kabanov-Stricker (2002) and to the pioneer papers of Frittelli (2000a) and (2000b). Also Bellini-Frittelli\n(2002), Grandits-Rheinla\u00a8nder (2002) and Schachermayer (2000) are also relevant papers to this particular ques-\ntion. Another family of papers use quadratic BSDEs to solve this problem when asset prices are continuous\nsemi-martingales. The first paper is due to El Karoui-Rouge (2000) when the strategies belong to a cone. More\nrecently, Sekine (2004) uses first order condition to state the quadratic BSDE related to the problem when\nconsidering a convex subset of Rn for the space of strategies. Mania et al. (2003), and very recently, Hu et al.\n(2003), solve the problem under BMO-assumptions.\n6 Comments\nThe framework of convex risk measures allows to set additional constraints or opportunities to economic agents\nwithout changing the characteristics of the general framework. In particular, a constraint imposed by another\nagent or the opportunity to invest on a financial market are technically equivalent as they simply lead to a\ntransformation of the agent\u2019s initial risk measure into another convex risk measure: both correspond indeed to\nthe solution of an inf-convolution problem. The penalty function of the generated risk measure is simply the\nsum of the penalty of the initial risk measure and the penalty associated with the constraint. The possibility of\ngenerating familiar risk measures opens for interesting economic interpretations. Modifications in the investment\nframework of an agent change her perception of risk and consequently generate a new risk measure. The fact\nthat it still holds the key properties of monotonicity, convexity and translation invariance is consistent with the\nnotion of risk measure itself.\nIn the optimal risk transfer problem we consider, the pricing rule of the structure is fully determined by the buyer\nas it binds her constraint at the optimum. It may be related to an indifference price, usually obtained in the\nproblems of replicating a terminal cash flow using a utility criterion. Note that the negotiation takes place here\nat two levels: not only the price is at stake but also the structure (or equivalently, in some ways, the amount).\nThis will lead to a higher probability of reaching an agreement between both agents. The optimal structure\nis explicitly derived when agents have dilated risk measures, generalizing the results obtained in the entropic\nframework. The optimal structure is always equal to a certain proportion of the issuer\u2019s initial exposure, the\nproportionality factor being constant and corresponding to the relative risk tolerance coefficient of the buyer.\nWhen both agents differ in their access to other investment opportunities either for hedging or diversification\npurposes, there is an additional term, taking into account these differences and leading both agents to more\ncomparable profiles after the transaction.\nThese results are especially interesting from a regulating point of view: standard diversification (i.e. simple\nquota sharing of the risk) will occur in exchange economies as soon as agents have dilated risk measures, or\nequivalently when they assess their respective risk exposure using the same family of risk measures and simply\ndiffer in their risk tolerance. The regulator may improve market diversification by imposing suitable and possibly\n23\ndifferent rules on agents.\nIn a general framework, when agents have different types of risk measure, an explicit derivation of the optimal\nstructure is no longer possible even if some necessary and sufficient conditions for its existence are obtained.\nThe use of dynamic programing techniques, in particular Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs)\nand non-linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), may help to study risk measures defined by their local\nspecifications as in Barrieu-El Karoui (2004). This question is an issue for further research.\nReferences\n[1] Artzner, P., Delbaen, F., Eber, J.M., Heath,D.: Coherent Measures of Risk, Mathematical Finance 9,\n203-228 (1999).\n[2] Barrieu, P.: Structuration Optimale de Produits Financiers en Marche\u00b4 Illiquide et Trois Excursions dans\nd\u2019autres Domaines des Probabilite\u00b4s, The`se de doctorat, Universite\u00b4 de Paris VI (2002).\n[3] Barrieu, P., El Karoui, N.: Structuration optimale de produits financiers et diversification en pre\u00b4sence de\nsources de risque non-ne\u00b4gociables, Comptes Rendus de l\u2019Acade\u00b4mie des Sciences, Se\u00b4rie I 336, 493-498 (2003).\n[4] Barrieu, P, El Karoui, N.: Optimal Derivatives Design under Dynamic Risk Measures, in Mathematics of\nFinance (eds: G.
