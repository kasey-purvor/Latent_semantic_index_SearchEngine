The data covers the period from 2000\nto 2003 (just after solar maximum).

L. Turnbull\n(k.turnbull1@lancaster.ac.uk)\nfrom the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind\nvia magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause. As\nsuch, substorms represent one of the fundamental modes of\nglobal energy circulation and magnetic flux transport in the\ngeospace environment (Cowley et al., 2003). Following day-\nside reconnection, magnetic flux is added to the tail lobes\ncausing the magnetic flux density in the tail to increase. This\nstored energy is eventually released in an explosive fashion\nand the magnetosphere undergoes rapid reconfiguration. The\nprocess of gradual energy storage followed by a sudden re-\nlease are usually referred to as the substorm growth and the\nexpansion phase, respectively. Substorms can occur at any-\ntime but are observed more frequently during high solar ac-\ntivity (Baumjohann et al., 1996).\nDuring the expansion phase, magnetospheric currents are\ndiverted through the Earth\u2019s ionosphere, resulting in large\ndisturbances in the magnetic field observed at the ground.\nThese rapid fluctuations in the ground magnetic field also\ninduce electric fields in the Earth\u2019s surface. Magnetic and\nelectric fields in the surface of the Earth are related by\nE\nB\n= Z (1)\nwhere Z is the impedance of the Earth. Z in a particular\narea depends on local conditions, such as conductivity and\nmagnetic permeability of the ground. The depth at which the\nmagnetic fields can penetrate the ground is also important\nas the average conductivity along this depth will affect the\nelectric field (Boteler, 1994). Therefore the geology of the\nUK and the magnetic field variations will both have an effect\non the induced electric fields in the surface.\nAs a consequence of magnetic field variations on the\nsurface of the Earth, an electromotive force is created be-\ntween earthed points of a conductor such as those in a\npower transmission network, causing geomagnetically in-\nduced currents (GIC) to flow along the network (e.g. Lehti-\nnen and Pirjola, 1985). GIC are quasi-dc when compared\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3422 K. L. Turnbull et al.: Mid latitude magnetic field during substorms\nto power transmission frequencies of 50\u201360 Hz, (Molinski,\n2002; Kappenman, 2007). GIC enter and exit a power trans-\nmission network through the earthed transformers at substa-\ntions possibly causing transformer saturation that can dam-\nage the transformer and disrupt the entire power network. In\n1989 a geomagnetic disturbance caused the Hydro-Que\u00b4bec\npower system to fail. At a cost of approximately $13 million,\nit is a perfect example of the risk posed to power networks\n(Bolduc, 2002). In 2003 large geomagnetic storms also\ncaused disruption to power networks including the Swedish\npower system where the city of Malmo experienced blackout\nfor 20 to 50 min. In 2000 a GIC of about 300 A was recorded\nin Sweden, the largest measured GIC value ever reported (as\nfar as we know) (Wik et al., 2008).\nAny type of geomagnetic disturbance may have an im-\npact on a power transmission network. The scale and size\nof the damage to a particular power transmission network\ndepend on the magnitudes of GIC in different parts of the\nsystem and on several technical matters, such as transformer\ntypes used, configuration of the network and load situation.\nLocal geological conditions also influence GIC production.\nWhen modelling GIC production in a power transmission\nnetwork there are essentially two factors to consider. First,\nthe electric field in the vicinity of the power transmission\nnetwork is calculated as though the network was absent, this\ninvolves knowledge of magnetospheric-ionospheric currents\nand of the Earth\u2019s conductivity structure. Second, this pri-\nmary field is used to calculate currents produced in the net-\nwork, so details of the power transmission network such as\nline and transformer resistances, topology and configuration\nof the network are also required (Lehtinen and Pirjola, 1985).\nAlthough the UK is located at mid latitudes and is there-\nfore not considered to be exposed to the risks posed by GIC,\npast events have proved this not to be the case. The UK\nnational grid has experienced problems as a result of GIC\nsuch as large reactive power swings and transformer fail-\nures. Although there have been no severe consequences for\ncustomers, a prolonged geomagnetic disturbance may cause\nwider disruption (Erinmez et al., 2002). The Scottish power\nsystem has also experienced similar problems with, for ex-\nample, GIC levels at monitoring sites rising to approximately\n40 A during the Halloween storm of 30 October 2003. Dur-\ning this event the surface electric field was 50 times greater\nthan quiet time levels (Thomson et al., 2005).\nOther mid latitude countries are also investigating the GIC\nrisk to their power transmission systems, including South\nAfrica which is especially at risk because of the long trans-\nmission lines involved (Ngwira et al., 2008). Failures and\ndamage of 15 transformers by internal heating, in the high\nvoltage South African main transmission system in Novem-\nber 2003 have been attributed to the production of GIC as\na result of geomagnetic disturbances (Gaunt and Coetzee,\n2007; Kappenman, 2005). Measurements of GIC at this time\nclosely resembled the results of a model of GIC production\nby geomagnetic events in the South African network (Koen,\n2002). This demonstrates the potential usefulness of a GIC\nmodel to a real power transmission network.\nSince direct measurement of the electric field at the Earth\u2019s\nsurface is not ideal over such a large area, the characteris-\ntics of the magnetic field produced by the substorm are used\ninstead. Studies of the characteristics of ground magnetic\nfield variations have tended to focus on higher latitude areas\nsuch as Fennoscandia, by looking at the time derivative of\nthe horizontal ground magnetic field, dH\/dt (Viljanen et al.,\n2001). In particular, a study by Viljanen et al. (2006) on\nthe relationship between substorms and H , using the Inter-\nnational Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE)\nnetwork concludes that the largest values of dH\/dt appear\nsoon after the expansion phase begins, although many events\nhave larger values at later times. The size of max|dH\/dt |\nincreases with increasing latitude equatorward of the auro-\nral oval, poleward of which it decreases. Furthermore, storm\ntime substorms can double the size of max|dH\/dt | at all lat-\nitudes compared to non-storm time substorms. It was also\nfound that although H is greatly influenced by the electro-\njet, dH\/dt is more susceptible to the effects of smaller scale\nionospheric features. The events looked at by Viljanen et al.\n(2006) occurred just after sunspot minimum and magnetome-\nter data were exploited to detect the substorm onset and anal-\nyse H , between magnetic latitudes 56\u25e6 N and 75\u25e6 N.\nThis study aims to characterise the magnetic field be-\nhaviour over the UK during a substorm. This is done by\nexploiting magnetometer data, including mid latitude mag-\nnetometer sites, to analyse the response of the ground mag-\nnetic field to substorms, however a method other than ground\nmagnetometry is used to identify substorm onsets. This study\nalso uses ground magnetometer measurements recorded at a\nhigher sampling rate than the Viljanen et al. (2006) study and\nuse data from a different period in the solar cycle. The results\nof this study will aid GIC modelling in the UK\u2019s power trans-\nmission network.\n2 Data and method\nSince the effect of substorms on GIC production is best\ncharacterised by analysing the variation of H sensed at the\nground, detection of substorm onset is established by an in-\ndependant method. This is achieved by using the list pro-\nduced by Frey et al. (2004) of substorm onset times and lo-\ncations determined by the IMAGE-FUV satellite. Onset time\nand location are found by studying images from the FUV im-\nager which observes aurora in ultra violet light, and looking\nfor particular behaviours (Frey et al., 2004):\n\u2013 a clear local brightening of the aurora\n\u2013 expansion of the aurora to the poleward boundary of the\nauroral oval and spreading azimuthally in local time for\nat least 20 min\nAnn.

(Geographic\nlatitudes).\n\u2013 at least 30 min had passed since the previous substorm\nonset, this is to eliminate events that did not develop\ninto full substorms\nThus the IMAGE-FUV mission produced substorm onset de-\ntails from 2000 to 2005 from all over the globe. This list of\nevents is reduced to only substorms that happen at a time and\nlocation suitable for scrutiny by the UK-Sub-Auroral Mag-\nnetometer Network (SAMNET), as it covers a range of mid\nto high latitudes including those that cover the UK. Since\nthe peak time for substorm onset to occur is at 23:00 MLT,\nthe list by Frey et al. (2004) was limited to events between\n18:00 MLT and 04:00 MLT and between latitudes of 25\u25e6 N\nand 90\u25e6 N, and longitudes of 30\u25e6 W and 60\u25e6 E. This resulted\nin a list of 553 substorm onsets that span 2000 to 2003 which\nis just after a solar cycle maximum. Figure 1 shows the loca-\ntions of SAMNET stations and substorm onsets included in\nthis study.\nThe substorm onsets are divided into those that occur dur-\ning storm time conditions (Dst<\u221240 nT, 83 subtorms) and\nnon-storm time conditions (Dst>\u221240 nT, 470 substorms),\nthe cut off value of \u221240 nT is consistent with Viljanen et al.\n(2006). The Dst used is the daily mean value of Dst for\nthe day at which the substorm occurs taken from NOAA Na-\ntional Geophysical Data Center (NGDC, 2009).\nThe time derivative of the horizontal ground magnetic field\ndH\/dt is the major contributor to GIC production (Viljanen\net al., 2006), so for each substorm onset an hour\u2019s data are\nneeded in order to investigate the effect of substorms on H .\nSAMNET data used here have a time resolution of 5 s and\nonly stations that had no interruptions during the required\none hour period are used. dH\/dt is calculated as the differ-\nence between successive readings divided by the sampling\nrate (Viljanen et al., 2001).\nThis study is in contrast to a similar study by Viljanen\net al. (2006) on the relationship between substorm character-\nistics and H which uses IMAGE to both pinpoint substorm\nonset, and analyse H .

(2006) covers CGM latitudes from\n55\u25e6 N to 75\u25e6 N which is not low enough to adequately cover\nthe UK; and sampling rate, Viljanen et al. (2006) has a 1 min\ntime resolution on its magnetic data. The substorms inves-\ntigated by Viljanen et al. (2006) occur just after a sunspot\nminimum, (1997\u20131999), whereas this study examines sub-\nstorms occurring just after solar maximum (2000\u20132003). The\ndifferences and similarities between these studies will there-\nfore improve understanding of the relationship between sub-\nstorms and variations in H at the Earth\u2019s surface.\n3 Results\nIn Fig. 2 the mean value of max|dH\/dt | of all substorms\ncalculated at each SAMNET station is shown against the\ncorrected geomagnetic (CGM) latitude of the SAMNET sta-\ntions. The plot shows that average max|dH\/dt | increases\nwith latitude for storm time and non-storm time substorm on-\nsets. It also shows that at all the stations the storm time values\nare greater (approximately double) than the non-storm time\nvalues, even at the lowest latitudes. The corresponding plot\nby Viljanen et al. (2006, Fig. 2) also shows an increase with\nlatitude up to 68\u25e6 N and the doubling of values in storm-time\nconditions.\nThe response time of the ground magnetic field to sub-\nstorm onset is an important consideration. For each event,\nthe time at which the maximum value of dH\/dt occurs, from\n20 min before onset and 1 h after, is recorded. Then for each\nSAMNET station a histogram is plotted showing how many\nmaxima occurred in each 1-min bin of the sampled data.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3421\/2009\/ Ann.

All four\npanels in Fig. 3 have a peak in the first minute after substorm\nonset and then a long tail which is as expected from such a\ncomplex process; this is also the case for the other SAMNET\nstations in this study. For some events larger dH\/dt seem to\noccur in the 20 min before onset, however these values could\nbe the result of two substorms occuring within a short time\nof each other or some other activity not associated with the\nsubstorm. Even though there are some values in the 20 min\nperiod before onset, there is still a clear peak at the time onset\napears. The northernmost station in the figure is Kilpisjarvi\nand seems to show some greater disruption than the others in\nthe later times. This could possibly be due to its proximity\nto the auroral oval. Figure 4 presents the same analysis, for\nstorm time events. These plots seem to show even more dis-\nruption, particularly at Kilpisjarvi, again this could in part be\ndue to the proximity of the auroral oval which tends to be at\nlower latitudes during storm time but also there is the effect\nof the small data sample: storm time substorms are only 15%\nof the total substorms used in this study. Even so, there is a\npeak in the first minute after substorm onset and a long tailed\ndistribution.\nThe most probable time for max|dH\/dt | to occur after\nsubstorm onset is the mode, which is calculated for each\nSAMNET station and plotted against CGM latitude for non-\nstorm time and storm time separately in Fig. 5. The non-\nstorm time modes almost all occur in less than a minute\nwhereas the storm time modes occur within 2 min. There\nalso appear to be two outliers in the storm time data, the out-\nlier at the lower latitude is a result of a small data sample for\nthat particular station, however the higher latitude outlier has\n\u221220 \u221210 0 10 20 30 40 50 600\n5\n#\n83 storm time events\n\u221220 \u221210 0 10 20 30 40 50 600\n5\n10\n#\n\u221220 \u221210 0 10 20 30 40 50 600\n5\n10\nn\nu\nm\nbe\nr o\nf e\nve\nnt\ns\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n# \n   \n \n\u221220 \u221210 0 10 20 30 40 50 600\n5\n10\noccurence time of max dH\/dt [min]\n#\nKIL\nNOR\nBOR\nHAD\nFig. 4.

When Fig. 5 is compared to Viljanen et al.\n(2006, Fig. 5), which also shows the most probable time of\nmax|dH\/dt | after onset over a range of latitudes, it can be\nseen that in storm time conditions the peak times start to in-\ncrease above 5 min at latitudes over 60\u25e6 N, in the non storm\ntime case this does not happen until latitudes above 70\u25e6 N. So\nit is possible that in Fig. 5 the storm time value at 66\u25e6 N is in-\ndicating the effect of the auroral oval on the occurrence times\nof max|dH\/dt |, however data for higher latitudes would be\nneeded to confirm this.\nAnn.

Histogram showing the standard deviation of times of occur-\nrence of max|dH\/dt | for each non-storm time event, 470 onsets.\nSubstorms are large scale events and can cause large\nmax|dH\/dt | at a range of sites, but the coincidence of the\noccurrence of max|dH\/dt | at multiple sites is significant to\nthe development of GIC in power transmission networks. It\nis therefore useful at this point to look at the standard de-\nviation of the occurrence time of max|dH\/dt | at the range\nof SAMNET stations for each event. Shown in Fig. 6 is the\nnon-storm time histogram of standard deviation of the time at\nwhich max|dH\/dt | occurs at SAMNET sites for each event.\nThere is a broad distribution with a peak around 20 min, the\nmedian is 14.4 min. Figure 7 is the same plot but for the\nstorm time onsets, again there is a broad range, with a peak\naround the 20 min mark, the median is 15.1 min.\nAs max|dH\/dt | is not usually a result of the largest H\nit is also useful to know how much of a correlation there is\nbetween the two values. So far this study has only been con-\nsidering dH\/dt and therefore it has not been necessary to\nconsider the actual value ofH . This can be significantly dif-\nferent from one site to another due to the natural background\nH and therefore H values at different sites are not directly\ncomparable. In order to compare values of H at the range of\nSAMNET sites, data for 24 h before and after each substorm\nonset time (i.e. a 48 h period) are examined and the median\nvalue taken for each event at each site. This is then subtracted\nfrom H at that site. Now data for each event at all sites can\nbe compared by using |H | (absolute median subtracted H ).\nThe largest max|dH\/dt | for each event and its correspond-\ning value of |H | (i.e. the value of |H | as max|dH\/dt | is\nachieved) are plotted against each other in Fig. 8 and 9. The\nnon-storm time events are plotted in Fig. 8 and show that\nmax|dH\/dt | does in general increase with increasing |H |,\n0 5 10 15 20 25 300\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nstandard deviation of occurrence time of max dH\/dt [min]\n#\n83 storm time substorm onsets\nmedian 15.1 min\nFig. 7. Standard deviation of time of occurrence of max|dH\/dt |\nfor each storm time event, 83 onsets.\nbut the correlation is only 0.5988. The corresponding value\nof max|dH\/dt | for a given value of |H | can vary by as much\nas \u00b18 nT\/s. The correlation for storm time events is 0.5886\nand also shows a general increase in max|dH\/dt | with |H |,\nhowever there is considerable variation.\nSince the direction of the magnetic field may be impor-\ntant to the susceptibility of a power transmission network to\nGIC, the directions of dH\/dt for max|dH\/dt | and of the\ncorresponding H must also be examined. Using the same\nvalues as in Fig. 8 and 9, the largest max|dH\/dt | vectors\nare plotted on a compass diagram enabling the magnitude\nand direction of the largest max|dH\/dt | for each event to\nbe compared. The same is also done for the corresponding\nvalue of median subtracted H . Figure 10, shows four com-\npass plots with magnetic north pointing to the top of the page\nand magnetic east to the right. The top two plots show the\nvectors of the largest |dH\/dt | for each event and the bottom\ntwo plots show the corresponding value of median subtracted\nH . Immediately obvious is the difference in the amount of\ndata available for non-storm time and storm time events. The\nplots for max|dH\/dt | in both non-storm and storm time plots\nshow that changes in the field occur in all directions with a\nrange of magnitudes up to about 20 nT\/s. The corresponding\nvalues of median subtracted H tend to mostly be directed to\nthe south, non-storm time values reach up to 750 nT. Storm\ntime values can reach over 1000 nT and about all of them\nare directed southwards. The southward polarisation of me-\ndian subtracted H is to be expected since it corresponds to a\nwestward current over SAMNET. The range of direction for\nmax|dH\/dt | suggests that it is not necessarily the westward\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3421\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3421\u20133428, 2009\n3426 K. L.

Instead, smaller scale structures in the ionosphere may\nplay an important role.\n4 Comparisons and conclusions\nThis study focuses on the time derivative of the horizontal\nground magnetic field as this is the key value when consid-\nering the generation of GIC from substorms (Viljanen et al.,\n2001). In particular the different characteristics in storm time\nand non-storm time substorms is of interest. In order to keep\nthe analysis of H separate from the detection of substorm\nonset, a list of substorm onsets produced by the IMAGE-\nFUV satellite (Frey et al., 2004) is used to find substorms\nthat occurred at a time and place suitable for SAMNET;\nconsequently all substorms occurred just after solar maxi-\nmum. The substorms are then divided into non-storm time\nand storm time substorms.\nThese are key differences to a similar study by Viljanen\net al. (2006) which was carried out using the IMAGE mag-\nnetometer network (geographic latitudes between 58\u25e6 N and\n79\u25e6 N) to detect substorm onset and analyseH between 1997\nand 1999 (just after solar cycle minimum) with a time reso-\nlution of 1 min.\nThe mean of max|dH\/dt | increases with CGM latitude\nup to 66\u25e6 N and storm time values are double non-storm time\nvalues even at low CGM latitudes of 45\u25e6 N shown in Fig. 2,\nessentially meaning that during storm time conditions lower\nCGM latitude sites experience average max|dH\/dt | levels\nsimilar to sites approximately 5\u25e6 higher during non-storm\ntimes.\n0 100 200 300 400 500 6000\n5\n10\n15\n20\nmaximum |H|, [nT]\nm\nax\nim\num\n d\nH\n\/d\nt [\nnT\n\/s]\n83 storm time substorm onsets\n \n \nFig. 9. Plot of |H | against corresponding largest max|dH\/dt | for\n83 storm time substorms . The line is the linear correlation.\nAll latitudes show a peak occurrence time of max|dH\/dt |\nin the first minute after onset for non-storm time substorms,\nwith a long distribution tail. The similar study by Viljanen\net al. (2006) shows a similar feature but the peaks occur\naround 5 min after onset. As Figs. 3 and 4 show there is some\nactivity before onset occurs but a clear peak at substorm on-\nset time. Since a main difference between these two studies\nis the higher sampling rate of the SAMNET data we have\nsynthesised 1 min SAMNET data to match that of the Vilja-\nnen et al. (2006) study and the same analysis performed. The\nresults still produce a peak in the first minute after substorm\nonset, so there is a reason for the difference in the studies\nother than data sampling rate. This study uses IMAGE-FUV\nobservation of auroral brightening to determine onset (with a\ntime resolution of \u223c2 min) while the paper by Viljanen et al.\n(2006) uses geomagnetic indices which have comparable un-\ncertainty. Studies into the timings of substorm onset indi-\ncators, e.g., Rae et al. (2009) highlight the difficulty in de-\ntermining precise onsets times. Since each method has its\nown inaccuracy and since the physics of substorm formation\nand development is still being debated, substorm onset time\nis somewhat subjective. For this study and the study by Vil-\njanen et al. (2006) it seems that the differences in pinpoint-\ning substorm onset and the time resolutions and accuracies\nof the methods used may be the cause of the discrepancy in\nmax|dH\/dt | occurrence time, and are unlikely to be a result\nof physical characteristics of mid latitude substorms.\nWhile there is some correlation between corresponding\nvalues of |H | and max|dH\/dt |, the large range (\u00b12 nT\/s\nat low |H | and up to \u00b18 nT\/s at larger |H |) suggests that a\nlarge max|dH\/dt | can be produced without an initially high\n|H |. There is little difference between the correlations for\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 3421\u20133428, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3421\/2009\/\nK. L.

The\ncorresponding values for median subtractedH are mostly di-\nrected to the south which indicates their connection to the\nwestward electrojet. The distribution of max|dH\/dt | sug-\ngests that short term changes of the field are influenced by\nother ionospheric events. These results agree with Viljanen\net al. (2006, Fig.8).\nAlthough this study uses substorms that are detected in-\ndependently of H measurements and with a higher time res-\nolution and at a different point in the sunspot cycle many\nof the results agree with the similar study by Viljanen et al.\n(2006). These similarities suggest the differences between\nthe two studies do not impact the results i.e. the basic char-\nacteristics of the ground magnetic field during substorms are\nnot affected by the difference in the stages of the solar cycle,\ndata sampling rate, method of determining onset, or loca-\ntion of study. Differences between solar cycle phase do not\nproduce differences in the results suggesting that substorm\ncharacteristics do not vary with the solar cycle. However\nthis study and that of Viljanen et al. (2006) do not cover all\nphases of a solar cycle and a future study examining sub-\nstorm characteristics through all phases over many cycles\nwill be needed to determine if there is any effect. However\nduring active phases of the solar cycle, storm time condi-\ntions that are expected to effect the ground magnetic field\nare more likely, doubling the mean max|dH\/dt | from those\nduring non-storm time conditions (as shown in Fig. 2).\nWith respect to modelling GIC production in a power\ntransmission network, the information gained in this paper\nwill be used to construct model magnetic fields with which\nto test GIC models. Of particular interest is the response\nof a power transmission network to a range of field orienta-\ntions and variations with time as well as simultaneity of large\ndH\/dt over the network. This present study will prove use-\nful in this endeavour.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3421\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3421\u20133428, 2009\n3428 K. L.
