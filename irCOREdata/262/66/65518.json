Presidents tend \nto enter office \u2013 Richard Nixon did, Bill Clinton certainly did \u2013 with a stated \ncommitment to a strong Department of State and a strong Secretary. Very often, \nhowever, this commitment breaks down. It did so very spectacularly in the case of \nPresident Nixon; but the same process has also affected other presidencies. This \narticle offers a brief review of Bill Clinton\u201fs two Secretaries of State, Warren \nChristopher (1993-97) and Madeleine Albright (1997-2001). It focuses particularly on \ntheir general orientation to the post, as well as their relationship with other foreign \npolicy principals. The article additionally considers the roles of the two Secretaries in \nthe context key transatlantic developments in the 1990s, notably concerning the \nenlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. By way of setting the stage for \nthis discussion, let us remind ourselves of the particular bureaucratic difficulties faced \nby any recent or contemporary Secretary of State. \n \n \nBEING A SUCCESSFUL SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE 1990s \n \nMany of the procedural problems of being Secretary derive from his or her lack of \nproximity to the president. The National Security Adviser is usually much closer to \nthe keeper of power in the White House, both literally and in terms of being more \nintimately tied into the president\u201fs immediate political interests and fortunes. If \nnothing succeeds like success, as far as the National Security Adviser is concerned, \nnothing propinks like propinquity. To use the terminology of a 1984 study, co-written \nby Clinton\u201fs first National Security Adviser, Anthony Lake, the Secretary of State is a \ndepartmental \u201ebaron\u201f rather than a presidential \u201ecourtier\u201f (1). By way of \ncompensation, a successful Secretary must enjoy good presidential access and trust. \nBesides the almost ontological rivalry with the National Security Adviser, the \nSecretary of State has a \u201enatural\u201f bureaucratic antagonism with the Secretary of \nDefence. The clashes between Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld during the first \nGeorge W. Bush administration were unusual in their openness and intensity; they \nreflected fundamental differences in international policy outlook. However, the \nPowell-Rumsfeld tension also drew in inherent differences of bureaucratic \nperspective. It is also not unusual for a Secretary of State to experience poor relations \nwith the White House political staff, a body, of course, even more intimately attached \nthan the NSC staff to the presidential political and electoral interest. Successful \nSecretaries of State have to negotiate these various minefields. They also have to \ncombine the job of departmental manager with that of foreign policy principal. \n \nIt is frequently observed that several of the most apparently successful and influential \nSecretaries of State, including James Baker under President George H. W. Bush, have \nactually made rather light of their departmental management responsibilities. A \n\u201estrong\u201f Secretary may actually preside over a demoralised and uncertain Department. \nA 1989 article in the Foreign Service Journal by a former director of the Foreign \nService Institute began: \u201eThe Department of State has qualities of a second-rate \norganisation: a poorly articulated mission, ill-defined goals, unhappy employees \u2026 \nand an apparent indifference to developing effective executives\u201f (2).  \n \nClinton\u201fs two Secretaries of State faced deep-seated as well as more transitory \ndifficulties in leading the Department. The State Department is regularly portrayed as \nprone to clientism. Another piece in the 1989 Foreign Service Journal recorded the \n\u201enegative stereotypes associated with the department\u201f, including the perception that \nForeign Service Officers \u201edefend the interests of foreign countries better than those of \ntheir own country\u201f (3). As James McCormick puts it, the State Department is, in \nbureaucratic terms, \u201eat once, too large and too small\u201f (4). Policy recommendations \nhave to traverse complex bureaucratic turf even before reaching the executive offices \nof the seventh floor at Foggy Bottom. Yet, as far as appropriations and the NSC \ninteragency process is concerned, the State Department is often outgunned by the \nintelligence agencies and by the Department of Commerce. \n \nSome particular features of the Clinton era should be noted. The early 1990s, of \ncourse, was the era of the \u201eKennan sweepstakes\u201f - the search for a successor to \nGeorge Kennan\u201fs Cold War doctrine of anti-communist containment (5). The race \nwas on to find a pithy and sellable purpose for American internationalism, and not \nleast for the future of Cold War alliance structures. The ending of the Cold War had \ncalled into question the prospects for existing policy and alliance architectures. Not \nonly did a successful Secretary of State have to fight the Department\u201fs bureaucratic \nand budgetary corner, he or she had to argue the case for deeply engaged international \ndiplomacy itself. A successful Secretary was required to transcend the, regularly \nbreached but traditionally helpful, conceptual distinction between a \u201ethinking\u201f NSC \nstaff and a \u201edoing\u201f State Department. \u201eThinking\u201f, devising new theoretical \nunderpinnings for US co-operative internationalism, to an unusual extent, was the job \nof Clinton\u201fs Secretaries of State. Above and beyond all this, the Secretaries had to \ncontend not only with the rise of economic foreign policy, but also \u2013 at least during \nWarren Christopher\u201fs tenure \u2013 with President Clinton\u201fs preoccupation with domestic \nissues. During the post-Cold War era (let us say, roughly 1989 to 2001), it seemed as \nif, to quote Norman Ornstein in 1994, \u201egeoeconomcs drives geopolitics, compared to \na Cold War agenda where geopolitics drove geoeconomics\u201f (6). Clinton\u201fs concern to  \nreprioritise economic foreign policy had major implications for America\u201fs chief \ndiplomatic agency. The president\u201fs early focus on domestic reform also set a less than \nauspicious context for his entire foreign policy team. Political commentator Elizabeth \nDrew offered the following distillation of instructions coming from the White House \nin 1993: \u201eKeep foreign policy from becoming a problem \u2013 keep it off the screen and \nspare Clinton from getting embroiled\u201f (7). \n \nPublic disputes between Secretary of State and National Security Council staff were \nnot a major feature of the Clinton years. Certainly, procedural foreign policy cohesion \nwas generally inferior to that prevailing under Clinton\u201fs immediate Republican \npresidential predecessor. However, the Clinton foreign policy team never exhibited \nthe disarray of the Carter (Cyrus Vance versus Zbigniew Brzezinski) era, nor indeed \nof the first administration of George W. Bush. Clinton\u201fs two National Security \nAdvisers, Tony Lake and Sandy Berger, remembered only too well how much the \nopen Vance-Brzezinski split had harmed Carter\u201fs operation. The weekly \u201epickle\u201f \n(PCL) meetings between William Perry (Defence Secretary, 1993-7), Lake and \nChristopher, were designed to head off any such damage. Yet there were still \nimportant personality clashes and bureaucratic snafus. State was severely, even \nhumiliatingly, marginalised on occasion, as during the planning for the 1994 invasion \nof Haiti. In July 1994, the Washington Post reported the \u201ebitter tension\u201f between the \nState Department and the White House political staff. White House counsellor David \nGergen was transferred to Foggy Bottom, reportedly to provide State with \u201epolitical \nreality checks in the foreign policy arena\u201f (8).  \n \nIf the early Clinton foreign policy-making context was defined to some degree by \n\u201eeconomics first\u201f and by presidential immersion in domestic agendas, the political \nframework for the later years was established by the Republican legislative election \nvictories of 1994. State, along with the entire foreign aid budget became a hunting \nground for Republican budget-cutters, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nchairman Jesse Helms. In 1995, Helms proposed to collapse the quasi-independent \nAgency for International Development (AID), the US Information Agency (USIA) \nand the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) into the State Department, \npending a \u201emajor re-examination of attitudinal, procedural and management issues \nwithin the department itself\u201f (9). Helms\u201f initial plan was vetoed by Clinton, though \nthe US Information Agency and ACDA were formally incorporated into the State \nDepartment in 1999. Though some of the reorganisation actually consolidated State\u201fs \nauthority, Clinton\u201fs Secretaries of State had to fight hard for funding against a \nbackground of legislative assault and poor departmental morale. Warren Christopher \ninformed Congress in 1996 that the US international budget had already been cut by \nhalf in real dollars since 1989. State Department employees began to display buttons \nbearing the slogan, \u201eJUST ONE PER CENT\u201f \u2013 a reminder of the actual proportion of \nfederal tax dollars devoted to non-military foreign spending. \n \nSome thirty-two US embassies and consulates closed between 1993 and 1997. Under \nWarren Christopher and Madeleine Albright, the State Department was subject to \nconstant and interminable reorganisations. In 1993, Vice-President Al Gore\u201fs \n\u201ereinventing government\u201f plan called for the integration of State\u201fs \u201epolicy, program \nand resource management processes\u201f to suit its post-Cold War role and its \n\u201eincreasingly limited\u201f resources\u201f (10). A 1996 report from former Secretary of State \nLawrence Eagleburger and former Ambassador Robert Barry resulted in a major \nexpansion in the role of undersecretaries, constituting a kind of \u201ecorporate board\u201f for \nthe Secretary (11). An internal report, State 2000, called for the radical integration of \nforeign and domestic policy, concluding: \u201eWe must learn, in fact, to see them as two \nparts of the same whole\u201f (12). \n \nThe problems of the State Department during the Clinton era \u2013 problems of direction \nand purpose, uncertainties connected to new threats and new agendas abroad, as well \nas the politics of divided government in Washington \u2013 were also the challenges facing \nClinton\u201fs foreign policy as a whole. How did Christopher and Albright measure up to \nthem, particularly in the context of transatlantic relations? \n \n \n \n \nWARREN CHRISTOPHER \n \nUnveiling a portrait of Warren Christopher in 1999, President Clinton described his \nfirst Secretary of State as America\u201fs first diplomat in over 50 years to face \u201ethe \nchallenge of defining our foreign policy without a single, overriding threat to our \nsecurity\u201f. Clinton also noted: \u201eChris has the lowest ratio of ego to accomplishment of \nany public servant I\u201fve ever worked with\u201f (13). For Madeleine Albright, Christopher \nwas \u201ea lawyer\u201fs lawyer, who emphasized preparation, precision and perseverance\u201f. \nStories circulated about his mildness, his fastidiousness and his reluctance to express \nemotion. On a stopover visit in Ireland, Christopher famously ordered a decaffeinated \nIrish coffee with no alcohol. For Albright, he was \u201ethe consummate team player\u201f (14). \nTo his critics, he was \u201eDean Rusk without the charisma\u201f. For sceptical Democrats, he \nfell short of the job requirements for Secretary in the post-Cold War era. To quote \nDavid Halberstam: \u201eChristopher, they thought, was too much the functionary, a \ncapable and highly competent bureaucrat, but probably a limited one, a man lacking \noriginality and beliefs of his own\u201f (15). \n \nChristopher had been a deputy to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in the Carter \nadministration, known particularly for his work in coordinating the human rights \npolicy at interagency level and for his role in the Iran hostage diplomacy of 1979-80 \n(16). He worked on the Clinton transition team from his base in California. Leading \ncandidates for the job of Secretary of State included Ed Muskie (for whom \nChristopher had worked following Vance\u201fs 1980 resignation), Zbigniew Brzezinski \n(National Security Adviser under Carter), and Senator Sam Nunn (Democratic \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee).. Compared to other candidates, \nChristopher was indeed a team player and this seems to have increased his \nattractiveness to Clinton. Warren Christopher formed a solid link to the previous \nDemocratic administration, but one whose relatively low profile lessened the \npossibility of old conflicts being reignited. At 67, he was a Democratic \u201egrey-head\u201f; \nseveral commentators pointed out that Christopher was precisely the same age as \nClinton\u201fs deceased father (William Jefferson Blythe) would have been. During the \ntransition Christopher was, according to Clinton, \u201ea whirlwind of activity\u201f (17). Yet \nChristopher\u201fs effectiveness was hampered not only by Clinton\u201fs own unpredictable \ninterventions, but also by his natural lack of forcefulness (18). As a prospective \nSecretary of State, Christopher had the advantage of being considerably younger than \nMuskie and personally more amenable to Clinton than Sam Nunn (19). Clinton seems, \nnevertheless, to have continued to regard Nunn as a species of Secretary-of-State-in-\nwaiting, a situation which apparently prompted Christopher to offer his resignation in \n1994. In due course, Clinton became reconciled to the Christopher style, valuing \nChristopher\u201fs reliability and dignified loyalty. According to Raymond Seitz (US \nambassador to London), Christopher stood out in the early Clinton team \u201elike an adult \nin a kindergarten\u201f (20). \n \nWarren Christopher\u201fs problems included the lack of guaranteed presidential access. \nTo some extent this was connected to the new \u201eeconomics first\u201f agenda. US Trade \nRepresentative Mickey Kantor seemed to have better access to Clinton. Christopher \nhad major difficulties both in articulating a post-Cold War vision and in asserting his \nleadership at State. To some degree this was a matter of personality and style. Seitz \nrecalled him advocating the \u201elift and strike\u201f policy in Bosnia in 1993 \u201ewith all the \nverve of a solicitor going over a conveyancing deed\u201f (21). For Sidney Blumenthal, \nChristopher had \u201ethe appearance of gravity\u201f but was \u201ewithout a vision\u201f (22). Clinton\u201fs \nfirst Secretary of State also endured some damaging diplomatic calamities which \nundermined his reputation as a safe pair of hands. The European trip of May 1993 was \nactually acutely discomforting for Christopher. His role in the Haiti decisions of 1994 \nwas minimal \u2013 a fact reflected in the omission of discussion of the invasion from his \nmemoir, Chances of a Lifetime (23). His subsequent visit to China, during which the \nauthorities took the opportunity to arrest leading dissidents, also contributed to his \nreputation for ineffectuality (24). Within State itself, Christopher had public \ndisagreements with Undersecretary Peter Tarnoff over the viability of \u201eassertive \nmultilateralism\u201f. The appointment of long-standing Clinton friend Strobe Talbott to \nlead Russia policy at State also ruffled feathers at the Department and raised \nparticular managerial difficulties for the Secretary. Clinton\u201fs shift to activism over \nBosnia in 1995-6 additionally involved the recognition of Richard Holbrooke, rather \nthan Christopher himself, as the effective leader of policy in this area. (25).  \n \nIf Warren Christopher had his share of diplomatic embarrassments, his professional \nstyle generally saw him through. Even on the wider issue of \u201evision\u201f, it can be argued \nthat Christopher has been judged rather unfairly. Following the \u201eKennan sweepstakes\u201f \nagenda largely set by Tony Lake, Christopher made numerous efforts to construct a \nnew rhetorical vision for American internationalism without the Soviet threat. He was \ncertainly not helped but his own lack of  personal forcefulness, yet others in the \nadministration scarcely fared better. It may also be argued that the \u201ethreat-less\u201f early \n1990s was not a propitious time for grand declaratory statements of internationalist \npurpose. The George H. W. Bush foreign policy team had provided a successful \nadjustment to post-Cold War conditions with little beyond the vague \u2013 and swiftly \nderided - \u201eNew World Order\u201f concept of 1990. \u201eVision\u201f can too often degenerate into \nrigidity, embarrassment and hot air. Yet to go too far along this line of argument \nwould be to underplay unduly the need of the Clinton team to produce a meaningful \nsuccessor to anti-communist containment as an integrating  formula for the new \nforeign policy. The early notion of \u201eenlargement\u201f (of markets and democracies) fitted \nthe priorities of the Clinton administration well enough. However, it achieved little \nwider credibility, and became hopelessly confused in the public consciousness with \nNATO enlargement. \n \nBeyond \u201eenlargement\u201f, the early Clinton team vision for foreign policy centred on the \nglobal environmental agenda. Frequently denigrated, especially at NSC level as \n\u201eglobaloney\u201f, global environmentalism had been given a formal ranking at State in \n1993, when Congress was persuaded to create the new post of Undersecretary for \nGlobal Affairs. The first such undersecretary was former Senator James Wirth, whose \nbrief encompassed much of what was to become the \u201enew security agenda\u201f of cross-\nborder threats of the later 1990s. Christopher is generally credited with little in the \nway of developing this agenda within State. He did have a commitment here, \nnevertheless. His concern for the environment ran back to his boyhood interests in \nNorth Dakota; he was influenced by Al Gore\u201fs environmental arguments and by the \nideas of David Kennedy, a leading environmental campaigner and president of \nStanford University. Christopher actually gave, at Stanford University in April 1996, \nwhat seems to have been the first ever speech by a Secretary of State devoted entirely \nto environmental concerns. He outlined the \u201enew threats\u201f such as \u201eterrorism, weapons \nproliferation, drug trafficking and international crime\u201f, but went on to emphasise \nparticularly \u201ethe vast new dangers posed to our national interests by damage to the \nenvironment and resulting global and regional instability\u201f (26).  \n \nChristopher\u201fs orientation to the duties of Secretary was, in Sidney Blumenthal\u201fs word, \n\u201elawyerly\u201f rather than mission-driven (27). His policy stances, especially towards the \nconflicts in the former Yugoslavia, were rooted in a caution which derived to some \ndegree, no doubt, from his character, but also from internalised \u201elessons of Vietnam\u201f. \nFor Dick Morris, Warren Christopher was insufficiently \u201epolitical\u201f (28). His \nintellectual orientation was towards incremental problem-solving rather than wider \nstrategic development. At the bureaucratic level, Christopher was not particularly \nadept at defending State Department budgets and prerogatives. Following a State \nDepartment \u201eStrategic Management Initiative\u201f in 1994, he actually set in motion the \nprocess of collapsing AID, ACDA and USIA into the State Department \u2013 a \nprogramme which was, as we have seen, taken up after 1994 by Jesse Helms. Warren \nChristopher\u201fs defence of his department against Republican budget-cutters amounted \nessentially to his often repeated assertion that the 1994 elections \u201ewere not a license to \nlose sight of our global interests or to walk away from our commitments\u201f (29). A \nState Department official writing in the Foreign Service Journal noted that the \nSecretary\u201fs strategy was \u201eto use a Masada, stand-or-die tactic, refusing to identify \nwhich parts of the foreign affairs community he is prepared to sacrifice\u201f. This had the \neffect that all parts of the budget became \u201eequally vulnerable to congressional budget \naxes\u201f (30).  Following the 1995 Republican Congressional takeover, Christopher \nfound himself damaged not only by his less than sure footed response to the new \nlegislative environment, but also increasingly  embarrassed by the super-activism of \nhis deputy Richard Holbrooke.  Christopher is usually regarded as a poor choice as \nClinton\u201fs first Secretary of State. This is a little harsh. Christopher was a useful \nanchor for the frequently wayward early Clinton foreign policy process. Nevertheless, \nin a difficult time for internationalist diplomacy, Christopher failed to achieve that \nreputation for policy effectiveness in Washington which is a precondition for success.   \n \n  \n \n \n \nMADELEINE ALBRIGHT \n \nThe flamboyance of America\u201fs first female Secretary of State contrasted sharply with \nthe style of her predecessor. Her appointment was aided by the support of Hillary \nClinton. It was also assisted by the fact that, compared to her main rival, Richard \nHolbrooke \u2013 favoured by Vice President Gore as Christopher\u201fs successor \u2013 she was \nactually less inclined to grandstanding and freelancing. There were also indications \nthat she was a Secretary of State who was broadly acceptable to the Republican \nleadership in Congress. She was confirmed by the US Senate, 99-0.  The other main \ncontender to succeed Christopher was Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. \nAlbright typically embarked on a Washington \u201ecampaign\u201f for the post. As she put it in \nher memoirs: \u201eI doubted that George Mitchell and Dick Holbrooke were sitting \ndemurely at home waiting for the phone to ring\u201f (31). The key to her strategy lay in \nthe development of a counter-network of Washington contacts and in finessing the \ngender issue. The key was to avoid any suggestion that the appointment be \u201emade a \nlitmus test of the President\u201fs commitment to womens\u201f rights\u201f. Clinton had already \nmade numerous high-profile female appointments and was unlikely to respond \npositively to any attempt to railroad him into naming the first female Secretary of \nState. The Albright camp actually urged restraint upon womens\u201f groups in connection \nwith the appointment; the idea of issuing a pro-Albright letter to female members of \nCongress was shelved (32).  \n \nAs US Representative to the United Nations during the first Clinton administration, \nAlbright had been associated with concept of  \u201eassertive multilateralism\u201f. The \nexpansiveness of this early vision was quite swiftly undercut by the more restrained \npragmatism put forward by Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff , as well as by \nClinton\u201fs own Presidential Directive 25 (33). Albright\u201fs most celebrated comments as \nSecretary of State related to the view of America as \u201eindispensable nation\u201f and to her \ndescription of her own \u201emindset\u201f as \u201eMunich not Vietnam\u201f (34). The \u201eindispensable \nnation\u201f mantra was taken up by key administration figures. Introducing his new \nSecretary of State in December 1996, Clinton made a point of using the phrase. The \n\u201eMunich not Vietnam\u201f motto was designed to fix the view of Albright as a principled \ndoer rather than a pragmatic temporiser. It fitted in, of course, with her extraordinary \nfamily history. As Strobe Talbott later put it: \u201eMore than any of the rest of us, she was \nliterally a child of the cold war: she had been eleven in 1948, when a Soviet-instigated \ncoup d\u201fetat forced her parents to gather up the family and flee their native \nCzechoslovakia\u201f (35). Brought up a Roman Catholic, Albright only discovered her \nJewish origins following her appointment to Foggy Bottom. Opposing Christopher, \nAlbright had strongly supported the invasion of Haiti in 1994. As Secretary of State \nshe was in the vanguard of the administration\u201fs activist wing in relation to Balkans \npolicy. Her own self-assessment was as a \u201epragmatic idealist\u201f \u2013 a Dean Acheson for \nthe 1990s . For Thomas Lippman, she \u201estruggled throughout her tenure to reconcile \nher proud image as a tough-talking, straight-shooting \u201cdoer\u201d with the administration\u201fs \nCandide-like belief in human improvement \u2013 that is, with its embrace of global \nmeliorism\u201f (36). \n \nAlbright certainly seems to have seen herself as a counterbalance to the \nadministration\u201fs wider tendencies both to na\u00efve \u201edo-goodery\u201f and to pragmatic wilting \nunder pressure. Here was a Secretary of State who was manifestly not short on \n\u201evision\u201f. Numerous speeches \u2013 for example, her address in Prague of July 1997, her \nHarvard commencement address of June 1997 and her Henry Stimson Center speech \nof June 1998 \u2013 outlined her expansive, interventionist and anti-appeasement views. A \nformer assistant to Zbigniew Brzezinski, Albright had, in David Halberstam\u201fs words, \n\u201eclimbed the foreign policy establishment carefully and slowly\u201f; yet, beyond her \ngeneral reputation for hawkishness, \u201eno one associated her with any particular view or \nwing\u201f of the Democratic Party (37). As UN Representative, Albright had been \nprominent in broadening the US remit in Somalia and had argued without success for \nmore activism on Bosnia. During the second administration, she wasted no \nopportunity to remind her listeners, often including the president himself, of the stated \n\u201egoal that America should remain the world\u201fs strongest force for peace, liberty, \nprosperity and security, so that we can build a future for the next generation free from \nthe worries and plagues of the past\u201f (38). Her model was Dean Acheson. \u201eThe test of \nour leadership, although far different in specifics\u201f, wrote Albright in 1998, \u201eis \nessentially the same as that confronted by Acheson\u201fs postwar generation\u201f (39). The \ntask at hand was nothing less than the creation of a post-Cold war liberal world order, \nwith American power as its fulcrum. The Clinton administration needed to match the \n\u201eleadership and creativity\u201f of the Truman\/Acheson years. In some respects the \ncontemporary challenge was easier. \u201eIn truth\u201f, Albright acknowledged, \u201eAcheson \nconfronted a chorus of critics far fiercer than mine\u201f (40). Even the Congressional \nRepublican leadership after 1994 did not attack Albright\u201fs basic loyalty in the way \ntheir predecessors had attacked Acheson\u201fs in the 1940s. In the 1990s, according to \nAlbright, the danger was as much the post-Cold War ambivalence towards \ninternationalism as political partisanship. \u201eWe invest fewer resources in defense, \ndiplomacy, and development. Since nations no longer need our protection from the \nSoviet Union, our international leverage, despite our strength, is not what it was in \nAcheson\u201fs day\u201f (41). \n \nAlbright\u201fs role as a policy advocate was seen most clearly in respect to the Balkans. \nBy the time of her arrival at the State Department, Bosnian policy had already shifted, \nand Christopher-like caution was strongly out of fashion. Indeed, her appointment \nwas itself an aspect of the Clinton administration\u201fs shift on Bosnia. Her major \nsubstantive impact was on policy towards Kosovo in 1999. Clinton himself, Defence \nSecretary William Cohen and Sandy Berger were far from sure that force would work \nin Kosovo. At a Principals\u201f meeting on June 15, Albright\u201fs case for a strong line \nagainst Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic was met by \u201e\u201dthere goes Madeleine again\u201d \nglances\u201f (42). Albright\u201fs reputation is closely bound up with what a Time magazine \ncover during the Kosovo bombing campaign dubbed \u201eMadeleine\u201fs War\u201f. Defending \nUS conduct in the approach to conflict, she later dismissed as \u201enonsense\u201f the view \nthat, at the Rambouillet conference in February 1999, \u201ewe missed signals from \nBelgrade that Milosevich was willing to sign an agreement\u201f (43).  \n \nBeyond the Balkans, Albright was a high-profile Secretary who was, in contrast to \nChristopher, relatively unconcerned about making enemies. Like Christopher, she \ntended to see State\u201fs takeover of AID, ACDA and USIA as something of a gain for \nher own department, rather than a victory for Republican budget cutters (44). Though \nunable to halt the dynamic of Republican foreign aid and foreign affairs budget \ncutting, she developed a surprisingly good relationship with Jesse Helms. In March \n1997, she was actually photographed holding Helms\u201f hand at a joint lecture in North \nCarolina. There ensued a quid pro quo wherein the administration accepted the \norganisational changes to the Agency for International Development, the US \nInformation Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, in return for \nHelms\u201f agreement to push for ratification of an international agreement which barred \nthe development of chemical weapons. (The Chemical Weapons Convention passed \nthe Senate in April 1997) (45). Albright was the highest-ever ranking US diplomat to \nvisit North Korea (October 2000). She supported and identified herself with the policy \nshifts of the second Clinton administration, including intense bombing and the \nembrace of the doctrine of \u201eregime change\u201f in Iraq (46). The second Clinton \nadministration was also increasingly willing to countenance unilateral policy options. \nIndeed the Kosovo campaign, which was waged without UN authorisation, exposed a \ndifficulty in working with the NATO allies which was to be reflected in later US \ncaution about multilateral warfare (47). Albright also played a central role in the \nvarious Middle East initiatives of 1997-8 and 2000. The villain at Camp David in \n2000 was, according to Albright, Yasser Arafat: \u201ethe Palestinians \u201ewouldn\u201ft yield a \ndime to make a dollar\u201f (48). She wrote in 2006 that Arafat \u201ecould have been the first \npresident of an internationally recognised Palestine\u201f. Instead, \u201ehe chose \u2026 the \napplause of supporters who praised him for refusing to sign away even a slice of \n\u201cArab land\u201d or acknowledge the sovereignty of Israel over the Western Wall\u201f (49). \n \nAlbright was not devoid of pragmatism; her line on Kosovo in the early part of 1999, \nfor example, was muted in face of the bureaucratic obstacles which then presented \nthemselves (50). However, as her account of the Camp David negotiations \ndemonstrates, her approach to international questions was relatively straightforward, \nswift in identifying the \u201ebad guy\u201f, and rather short on nuance. In these respects she \nwas the opposite of Christopher.  Her enemies within the administration certainly \nincluded Defence Secretary William Cohen. She also clashed on occasion with Sandy \nBerger, though she appears to have recognised that the National Security Adviser \nfrequently reflected the complex doubts, especially regarding Kosovo, of Clinton \nhimself. Later on a major critic of the interventionist foreign policy of the George W. \nBush administration (51), in some respects, she laid the foundations for it. \n \n \n \n \nCHRISTOPHER, ALBRIGHT AND NATO ENLARGEMENT \n \nThe case for enlarging NATO in the early part of the first Clinton administration was \nmade within the State Department, not by Christopher, but in a widely circulated \nmemo from Lynn Davis, Undersecretary for International Security. In August 1993, \nDavis and State Policy Planning head Sam Lewis formally put the case for \nenlargement to the Secretary of State. According to Davis and Lewis, the fudging of \nthe enlargement issue, which had taken place under the George H.W. Bush \nadministration, should not continue. Further \u201eavoidance of this issue will undermine \nNATO by reinforcing the growing perception that the Alliance is only marginally \ninvolved in addressing Europe\u201fs new security problems\u201f (52).   \n \nChristopher generally accepted the line being urged upon him by his juniors at State, \nwho were now being supported by Tony Lake at the NSC. The case against \nenlargement was presented to Christopher by some fifteen senior diplomats, who \nanchored their case in the likely reaction in Moscow. Outlining an argument that was \nto be taken up by none less than George Kennan, the diplomats asserted that \nenlargement would isolate Russia. The project of integrating Russia into western \nsecurity, economic and political networks had been an important part of the late- and \npost-Cold War dynamic, and had brought success. Extending NATO up to the \nRussian border would engender perceptions of encirclement, marginalisation and even \ngratuitous humiliation (53).  \n \nIn June 1993, Christopher was prepared, at the Athens NATO summit, to hold open \nthe prospect of enlargement though with little in the way of definite commitment. By \nearly 1994, he was defending  NATO expansion as a contribution to \u201eEuropean \nstability and to transatlantic burden-sharing\u201f (54). The push for expansion was kept \nalive by the Partnership for Peace agreement with Moscow, announced in January \n1994. Partnership for Peace, a compromise between the pro-expansion State \nDepartment (led in this policy area by Strobe Talbott) and the cautious Pentagon, \nrepresented an effort to ease Russian worries by bringing Moscow into a modulated \nconsultative role with NATO. At this stage, Clinton also announced his own \ncommitment to expansion \u2013 to a position not of \u201ewhether\u201f it would occur, but \u201ewhen\u201f. \nDuring 1994-5, the key mover of the enlargement agenda at State was Richard \nHolbrooke, who was appointed as Assistant Secretary for Europe and Canada in \nSeptember 1994. Holbrooke worked with an inter-agency bureaucratic coalition, with \nNicholas Burns and Alexander Vershbow  at the NSC.  The split with the Defence \nDepartment became apparent with the issuing of the \u201ePerry principles\u201f \u2013 Secretary \nPerry\u201fs conditions for accepting new NATO members \u2013 during 1995. While the \nPentagon demanded progress towards democratic accountability and compatibility of \narmed forces between new and old members, Christopher became an important public \nadvocate of the programme. In September 1996, with the Partnership for Peace now \nagreed with Moscow, Christopher announced that the first invitations to join the new \nNATO would be issued in 1997. It was widely assumed that these invitations would \ngo to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. As the presidential election \napproached, however, Christopher\u201fs own bureaucratic standing slipped in the \nanticipation that he would no longer be in office after January 2007. Tony Lake issued \nhis memo, \u201eNATO Enlargement Agenda Game Plan\u201f in June 1996 and on his \ndeparture from office in January 1997, handed over the policy lead to the new \nNational Security Adviser, Sandy Berger (55). \n \nPortrayed by Moscow as \u201eMadam Steel\u201f, Clinton\u201fs new Secretary of State was an \nunambiguous advocate for expansion. By this time, some of Moscow\u201fs more serious \nfears had been allayed, not only by the Partnership for Peace, but also by the \napparently mutually agreeable settlement in Bosnia. Albright\u201fs Senate confirmation \nstatement set the tone for her stance on NATO. Characteristically calling up the shade \nof Dean Acheson, she looked \u201eto do for Europe\u201fs East what NATO did 50 years ago \nfor Europe\u201fs West: to integrate new democracies, defeat old hatreds, provide \nconfidence in economic recovery and deter conflict\u201f (56).  Strobe Talbott recalled her \nsaying that she felt the case for admitting the Central European countries into NATO \n\u201ein my bones and in my genes\u201f (57). Moscow\u201fs final reconciliation to expansion \noccurred at the Helsinki summit of March 1997 alongside new cooperative \nagreements. Russian President Boris Yeltsin was prepared to accept expansion \nprovided no former Soviet states were included in the first accessions. Albright\u201fs role \nin all this was central. At Helsinki she developed working relationships with Yeltsin \nand with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov. Replying to Yeltsin\u201fs \ncomments about her Cold War Czech background, she replied (as Strobe Talbott puts \nit \u201erather sternly\u201f): \u201eA new Russia has been born and it has nothing in common with \nthe former Soviet Union, and that goes for Russian foreign policy as well\u201f (58). At the \nSintra (Portugal) NATO meeting in May 1997, she persuaded the West Europeans to \nrestrict the number of new entrants to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. \nNATO\u201fs decision was finalised in Madrid in July. Following the Madrid summit, \nAlbright gave an emotional account of the enlargement process in Prague, talking of \n\u201ethree journeys\u201f: her own journey to America, Europe\u201fs journey from war and \ncommunism, and the Czech Republic\u201fs journey to its \u201erightful place in the family of \nEuropean democracies\u201f (59). Her main priority now was to persuade the US Senate to \nratify the new arrangements. Her successful campaign emphasised NATO adaptation \nand burden-sharing, as well as the march of democracy. The campaign went hand-in-\nhand with an assault on the forces of neo-isolationism and American introversion. At \nHarvard University in June 1997, for example, she urged her country not to forget \n\u201ewhat the history of this century reminds us, that problems abroad, if left unattended, \nwill all too often come home to America\u201f (60). The new members were welcomed to \nthe Washington NATO summit in 1999. \n \nThe story of NATO enlargement under Clinton puts into sharp focus the differences \nbetween his two Secretaries of State. Christopher worked slowly, reacting to the pro-\nenlargement bureaucratic consensus as it built. His style was rational, cautious and \nsometimes dilatory. Albright was emotional, utterly committed to the cause of NATO \nexpansion, and also extremely effective, especially in dealing with NATO allies and \nwith the US Senate in the ratification debate. In the first Clinton term, as James \nGoldgeier argues, Tony Lake was the enlargement \u201econceptualizer\u201f and Richard \nHolbrooke its \u201eenforcer\u201f (61). Yet the picture had changed by 1997. Albright did not \nhave to develop new arguments, merely to run with the dynamic begun in the first \nadministration. More generally, though she articulated a forceful case for committed \nAmerican internationalism and greatly raised the profile of the State Department, she \nwas unable to secure resources for American diplomacy commensurate with the role \nof \u201eindispensable nation\u201f. The White House, rather than Foggy Bottom, remained in \ncontrol of major foreign policy initiatives.  Even at the end of the Clinton years, State \nremained a body which was struggling to come to terms with a world without the \nintegrating Soviet threat. \n \n \n  \n                            NOTES \n \n1.
