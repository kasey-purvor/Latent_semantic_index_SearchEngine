This article argues that TER is characterised by the mutual\ndysfunctionality of the political agenda and its institutional structure. The traditional narrow agenda, which has\nfocused almost exclusively on reducing non-tariff trade barriers, is a principal reason for this. This article uses the case\nof industrial and labour relations to demonstrate that greater engagement with major stakeholders and broadening\nthe political agenda are key to breaking the deadlock. The article also argues for institutional innovations that could in\nprinciple be transferred to other neglected policy areas of TER.\nIn a relative sense Transatlantic Economic Relations (TER)\nwas less explored by American and European politicians\nfor much of the 20th century as the ideological conflict\nof the cold war and shared security interests took prior-\nity. Since the Berlin Wall fell, in the wake of rapidly glob-\nalising trade and capital and more recently with the\nglobal recession, economic issues and interests have\nnaturally come to prominence and TER, with the\nEuropean Union (EU) and the United States (US) as key\nplayers, has assumed increasing importance. To date,\nhowever, the tangible results of TER are widely judged\nas disappointing.\nWhile TER is the most developed case of economic\ninterregionalism (H\u00e4nggi and Roloff, 2006) and has shown\nsignificant deficiencies, relative to the security relation-\nship, it remains largely underexplored in academic discus-\nsion and analysis. This article however is not intended to\nsurvey the existing debates of the topic or the linkages\nof TER with the wider literature on interregionalism or\ngovernance.1 It moreover seeks to place TER in its broad\neconomic, historical and political context, scrutinise\nspecific institutional and political problems associated\nwith TER and propose policy solutions.\nThis survey article argues that TER, as it currently oper-\nates, is characterised by the mutual dysfunctionality of\nthe political agenda and its institutional structure. It\nmakes the case that it is the traditional narrow politi-\ncal \u2044economic agenda, focused almost exclusively on\nreducing non-tariff trade barriers, which is culpable for\nTER weakness. Focusing on policies and institutions and\nusing the specific case of industrial and labour relations,\nthe greater engagement with major stakeholders is iden-\ntified as the key to breaking the deadlock in TER.\nIn order to achieve this broader engagement, the\narticle makes the case for institutional innovations,\nsetting out some key principles and proposing new\nmechanisms including the creation of a new secretariat\nto act as a permanent contact point and provide a vari-\nety of practical functions. The authors argue that these\ninnovations will not only help to address the problems\nin the field of industrial and labour relations but could\nin principle also be transferred to other neglected\npolicy areas of TER. The policy proposals developed in\nthis survey article would help to overcome some of the\nmost important problems of TER and significantly\nimprove its effectiveness. With the Obama administra-\ntion in Washington and a relatively new European\nCommission in place there is a window of opportunity\nto reshape TER and start working on solving its prob-\nlems by including a wider spectrum of interests and\nstakeholders.\nTransatlantic economic relations in broad\ncontext\nIn a world order that was shaped by the victors of the\nSecond World War and the new ideological conflicts that\ndeveloped in its wake, transatlantic relations have been\nGlobal Policy Volume 2 .

Common American and European security inter-\nests, organised and resourced through NATO, were prior-\nitised by politicians and academics alike throughout and\nsince the cold war. Indeed, the attention paid in more\nrecent years to the so-called \u2018Global War on Terrorism\u2019\n(GWOT) and the differences between US and European\napproaches (Daalder, 2003) has served to divert attention\nfrom other policy fields in which the EU and the US have\ncommon concerns and interests. One such policy field is\nTER, which, when compared to these other features of\nthe relationship, has been less explored by academics\nand neglected by political leaders.\nInterestingly, while the political dynamics of TER reflect\nthe domestic and international political climate, there is a\nlimited correlation to the core economics of the partner-\nship. Pollack and Shaffer have argued that there is no\nevidence that political frictions in the fields of security and\nforeign policy have had any significant impact on the vol-\nume of transatlantic trade and investment (Pollack and\nShaffer, 2006). In terms of many core indicators, the trans-\natlantic economic partnership is the biggest and arguably\nstill the most important one in the world. Comprising\nroughly 800 million people, the US and the EU accounted\nfor 57 per cent of world GDP, 33 per cent of global trade\nin goods and 42 per cent of trade of services in 2007\n(European Commission, 2008). A research report written\nfor the US Congress summarised the external economic\neffects of the transatlantic partnership with the conclusion\nthat the \u2018combined weight of these two economic super-\npowers means that how the US and EU manage their rela-\ntionship and the difficult issues involving domestic\nregulations, competition policy, and foreign investment\ncould well help determine how the rest of the world deals\nwith similar issues\u2019 (Ahearn et al., 2008, p. 3). Given a weak\nframework of global governance institutions and fre-\nquently unsuccessful World Trade Organization (WTO)\ntalks, the transatlantic relationship has the potential to\nestablish international economic rules \u2013 that could de\nfacto become global standards \u2013 using the two blocs\u2019\ncombined power as the biggest producers and consumers\nof goods and services in the world. And yet it has largely\nfailed in this task.\nIn historical context, transatlantic cooperation can be\ntraced back to the early 20th century but was first\ndragged into the political spotlight with President John F.\nKennedy\u2019s \u2018Declaration of Interdependence\u2019. In a speech in\nPhiladelphia on 4 July 1962, the president claimed \u2018that\nthe United States will be ready for a Declaration of Inter-\ndependence, [and] that [the US] will be prepared to dis-\ncuss with a united Europe the ways and means of forming\na concrete Atlantic partnership, a mutually beneficial part-\nnership between the new union now emerging in Europe\nand the old American Union founded \u2026 175 years ago\u2019\n(Kennedy, 1962). Nevertheless, the transatlantic partner-\nship up until 1990 remained motivated by the shared\nsecurity concerns of the cold war.\nTransatlantic relations in the economic field would\nhave to wait until the collapse of the Soviet Empire. And\nso it was that the \u2018Transatlantic Declaration\u2019 (TD) of 1990\nbecame the first official agreement in the new era of\ntransatlantic relations. A declaration of shared values, it\nclaimed that the US and the European Union were:\nmindful of their common heritage and of their\nclose historical, political, economic and cultural\nties \u2026 recognizing that the transatlantic solidar-\nity has been essential for the preservation of\npeace and freedom and for the development of\nfree and prosperous economies as well as for\nthe recent developments which have restored\nunity in Europe (US Government, 1990).\nSignificantly, the TD began the process of institutionalis-\ning the transatlantic partnership by establishing biannual\nand ad hoc consultations between EU and US officials\nand ministers.\nThe process of institutionalisation went along with a\nnecessary shift in transatlantic relations from security to\neconomic interests. This shift of focus made the transat-\nlantic partnership more complicated since the economic\npolicy field was far more conflict ridden than the comfort-\nable, shared security interests of the cold war. The new\nframework focused on bringing down economic barriers\nto trade but it also served to highlight the many differ-\nences in regulation and political preferences. As Barry\nEichengreen of the University of California at Berkeley\nobserved in 1998, \u2018Economic globalization in the after-\nmath of the cold war may be causing tariffs, capital con-\ntrols, and transport costs to decline, but it is also putting\nfirms in the United States and Europe into closer competi-\ntion\u2019. He concluded that \u2018policies on one side of the\nAtlantic \u2013 be they central bank decisions over the interest\nrate, congressional and parliamentary decisions about the\nbudget, or government decisions about competition and\nregulatory policy \u2013 are having strong repercussions on the\nother. The scope for conflict in such an environment is\nconsiderable\u2019 (Eichengreen, 1998, p. 1).\nBy 1995 the \u2018New Transatlantic Agenda\u2019 (NTA) repre-\nsented an evolution of the institutionalisation of the\nbilateral partnership. Signed by US President Bill Clinton,\nEU Commission President Jacques Santer and EU Council\nPresident Felipe Gonz\u00e1les, NTA was a commitment to or-\nganised cooperation in the key strategic areas of peace\nand stability, democracy and development around the\nworld, responding to global challenges, the expansion of\nworld trade and closer economic relations, and building\nbridges across the Atlantic (European Union, 1995).\nA series of institutional innovations was created which\nMaking TER Work\n107\nGlobal Policy (2011) 2:1 \u0002 2011 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\nMark Pollack described as \u2018a new and novel institutional\narchitecture linking Washington and Brussels across a\nwide range of issue-areas, representing the most system-\natic effort at genuine bilateral governance in the history\nof the transatlantic partnership\u2019 (Pollack, 2005, p. 900).\nThe NTA complemented the intergovernmental institu-\ntionalisation of the TD by creating a variety of civil soci-\nety dialogues to strengthen Atlantic bridge building and\nstructured networks of lower-level officials. After the\nNTA, the institutional structure of transatlantic relations\nlooked as follows (Pollack, 2005).\nIntergovernmental level\n\u2022 Regular summit meetings between the US president\nand a delegation of EU officials (mostly the EU Commis-\nsion President and the rotating Presidency of the Council\nof Ministers plus the High Representative for the\nCommon Foreign and Security Policy).\nTransgovernmental level\n\u2022 Transatlantic networks of lower-level US and EU offi-\ncials working on foreign policy and especially economic\nissues. These networks work largely unaffected by the\ndynamics of transatlantic high politics.\nTransnational level\n\u2022 Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) \u2013 consisting of\nEuropean and American CEOs lobbying for the liberali-\nsation of the transatlantic marketplace.\n\u2022 Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD) \u2013 network of\nEU and US consumer organisations.\n\u2022 Transatlantic Labor Dialogue (TALD) \u2013 dialogue of\ntrade unions (had only a handful of meetings but has\nnot been formally abolished).\n\u2022 Transatlantic Environmental Dialogue (TAED) \u2013 dialogue\nof environmental stakeholders (ceased to exist in 2001).\n\u2022 Transatlantic Legislator\u2019s Dialogue (TLD) \u2013 created in\n1999 as a formal response of the European Parliament\nand US Congress to the NTA commitments. Its main aim\nis to enhance the level of discourse between members\nof the European Parliament and the US Congress.\nThe institutional innovations of the NTA were politically\namended by the Transatlantic Economic Partnership\n(TEP) agreement of 1998, which clarified the agenda of\nthe transatlantic economic partnership beyond doubt\n(European Commission, 1998). The TEP effectively stated\nthat the main purpose of transatlantic economic rela-\ntions was the abolition of tariff and non-tariff barriers to\ntrade and investment (Meyer, 2008). This narrow political\nagenda was to have some serious consequences for the\neffectiveness of transatlantic institutions.\nStructural dysfunctionality\nInstitutional structures are not an end in their own right\nand exist to support a political agenda. And the narrow\npolitical agenda has been at odds with the institutional\nstructure which, at least on the transnational level,\nincluded a wider variety of stakeholders. In this situation,\nthe narrow focus on trade liberalisation and deregulation\nhas meant dysfunctionality in the TER process and struc-\nture because for many stakeholders in the institutions\nthere was nothing at stake in the agenda (or worse it\neven contradicted their interests). For example, the\nTransatlantic Labor Dialogue (TALD) folded after just a\nfew meetings because trade unions believed that there\nwas simply nothing to gain or achieve in the framework\nof a purely free-market political agenda (Compa and\nMeyer, 2010). The Transatlantic Environmental Dialogue\n(TED) suffered a similar fate and ceased to meet in 2001.\nEven the Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD), the\ntransnational dialogue with arguably the biggest interest\noverlap with the TER agenda, nearly \u2018ran aground\u2019 when\nit seemed increasingly difficult to deliver progress in the\nbusiness community\u2019s interest (Pollack, 2005).\nThere was some progress, notably in the area of\nMutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) during the\n1990s. But as Pollack and Shaffer explained, \u2018In the view\nof many participants, the \u2018\u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019\u2019 for eco-\nnomic cooperation had been picked. Governments on both\nsides now found it difficult to move beyond symbolic\nagreements and rearguard efforts at conflict resolution.\nEnhanced cooperation among regulators had not\nprevented new and bitter trade disputes from arising\u2019\n(Pollack and Shaffer, 2006, p. 63).\nIt was this ineffectiveness of TER that led to the EU\nCommission\u2019s 2004 Review of the Framework for Relations\nbetween the European Union and the United States. The\nreport highlighted further agenda-setting problems and\ncriticised the tendency of TER to become overloaded\nwith too many issues in very specific economic sectors\nwhile failing to prioritise issues of strategic importance.\nInsufficient political ownership was another problem that\nwas detected by the Commission, which argued that\nwithout renewed political commitment at the highest\nlevel, strategic agenda setting would be impossible\n(European Commission, 2004). Some of the report\u2019s rec-\nommendations were adopted in the most recent transat-\nlantic economic agreement: The Framework for Advancing\nTransatlantic Economic Integration (FATEI), adopted in\nApril 2007, bringing innovations to the political as well as\nthe institutional levels. Politically, the FATEI to a degree\nrepresented a shift of rationale, stressing the external\neffects of the transatlantic partnership and arguing that\ndeeper transatlantic economic integration \u2018will encourage\nother countries to adopt the transatlantic economic\nmodel of respect for property rights, openness to\nHenning Meyer and Stephen Barber\n108\n\u0002 2011 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Global Policy (2011) 2:1\ninvestment, transparency and predictability in regulation,\nand the value of free markets\u2019 (The White House, 2007).\nThis new awareness of the external impact of the\ntransatlantic economic partnership can be interpreted as\nsomewhat defensive in view of rising competition, espe-\ncially from China, and its significance was reflected in a\nreport of the Congressional Research Service (CRS):\n\u2018Given quite similar interests in bolstering the multilateral\ntrading system, many analysts say that both sides could\ncooperate more in addressing the rising challenge posed\nby China\u2019 (Ahearn et al., 2008, p. 33). The congressional\nresearchers made a fundamentally important point.\nIn view of rising economic challenges from other parts\nof the world, the economic interests (especially external\nones) of the EU and US are seemingly converging.\nAlthough the internal problems in the partnership\nremain, the changing external framework might well\nprove to be a driver for intensified transatlantic eco-\nnomic cooperation in the future.\nIn institutional terms, the FATEI created the most\nprominent transatlantic institution to date: the Transat-\nlantic Economic Council (TEC), which represents what\nthe 2004 European Commission report was calling for:\nnew political ownership at the highest level. Permanent\nTEC members are currently the European Commissioners\nfor External Relations and Trade as well as Internal\nMarket and Services. The US side is represented by the\nUS Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce as well as\nthe US Trade Representative. Upon invitation by the co-\nchairs of the TEC other EU Commissioners and US cabi-\nnet members may take part in TEC meetings (European\nCommission, 2007). In terms of its internal agenda, the\nTEC focuses on regulatory cooperation in addition to\ndeeper integration in the areas of intellectual property\nrights, trade, financial markets, innovation and technol-\nogy as well as investment.2 What the TEC has so far\nfailed to address, however, is the underlying reason for\nthe disappointing results of TER. With a focus on labour\nand industrial relations, the final part of this article will\ntry to make some progress in doing so and begin to\ndevelop political as well as institutional proposals to\novercome TER fundamental weakness.\nBroadening the political agenda, labour\nstandards and institutional innovation\nThe promotion of transatlantic trade and the reduction\nof barriers have been good for EU and US economic\ndevelopment and should continue. In isolation, however,\n\u2018free trade\u2019 as a political mission or simply as a slogan\nfails to reflect the complexity of this and other global\neconomic relationships. Even worse, the narrowness of\nthe political agenda has led to the partial dissolution of\nthe institutional structure and the disengagement of the\ndiverse stakeholders required for making TER work.\nFurthermore, in reality this huge trading market cannot\nbe accurately described as \u2018free\u2019. After all, countries and\nregions have always managed their trade relationships\nwith a range of tariff and non-tariff measures (most\nrecently during the recession, in the use of government\nprocurement to bolster domestic industry).\nTrade has always been \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 con-\nstrained or enabled by governments and the TEC will\nnot be able to eliminate strategic trade policies. Indeed\nsuch systematic failures as have been described might\nbe attributed to the artificial delinking of narrow trade\nissues and broader social concerns such as labour rights\nand standards as well as environmental issues. Were it to\nadopt the more sophisticated mission of managing\ntransatlantic trade relations rather than simply pursuing\nthe singular and unachievable goal of abolishing all\ntrade barriers, the TEC could make some progress in\naddressing TER dysfunctionality. Tackling this problem\nwould require an inversion of the current dynamics.\nInstead of pushing stakeholders out of the process with\nan all too narrow political agenda, the broadening of it\nwould give stakeholders new incentives to participate in\na process which would then also address issues of a\nwider political nature. In doing this, the TEC would be\nable to make progress in prioritising issues of strategic\nimportance and broaden the political ownership of TER.\nIn view of the history and performance of TER described\nabove, such an evolution of mission and broadening of\nfocus would appear to be a prerequisite if the process is\nto be reinvigorated.\nSuch a broadening of the political agenda would how-\never also require a widening of the institutional struc-\nture. This article takes the area of industrial and labour\nrelations as a case study to illustrate this need. Simply\nreinstating the Transatlantic Labor Dialogue as a regular\nmeeting between trade union representatives even in\nthe framework of a broader TER would not adequately\nrepresent industrial and labour relations issues. As Pro-\nfessor Lance Compa of the Industrial and Labor Relations\nSchool of Cornell University made clear in a recent\nreport, there are a variety of issues in transatlantic indus-\ntrial relations, including International Labour Organisa-\ntion (ILO) standards compliance, the undermining of the\nright of union representation to gain competitive advan-\ntage and the regulatory arbitrage of multinational firms\noperating in both regions, which participants would\nwant to see addressed in the TEC framework if it is to\nclaim relevance (Compa and Meyer, 2010). An institu-\ntionalised trade union dialogue alone would not be able\nto achieve this.\nTherefore, in order to integrate properly industrial and\nlabour relations issues in the TER framework, a compre-\nhensive code of conduct for firms involved in transatlan-\ntic trade needs to be developed and agreed. Such a new\ncode of conduct representing broader political concerns\nMaking TER Work\n109\nGlobal Policy (2011) 2:1 \u0002 2011 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\nneeds to be monitored by a reformed institutional struc-\nture. Essential reforms include bringing the EU Commis-\nsioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion\nas well as the US Labor Department\u2019s director of the\nInternational Labor Affairs Bureau (ILAB) and the US\nState Department\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Democracy,\nHuman Rights and Labor (DRL) into the TEC as perma-\nnent members. Furthermore, the re-establishment of the\nTALD as a coordinating institution and the provision of a\ndedicated secretariat to fulfil a variety of practical func-\ntions would also prove to be indispensable (Compa and\nMeyer, 2010).\nGiven insufficient take-up by the wider G20, TEC is a\ncentral forum for the EU and US in setting benchmarks\nfor labour and industrial standards. The establishment of\na permanent secretariat is above all targeted at opera-\ntionalising industrial and labour relations issues in the\nframework of the TEC, linking them into existing mecha-\nnisms and procedures and with political institutions such\nas Congress, the European Parliament, the European\nEconomic and Social Committee (EESC) and the ILO.\nThe specific tasks of the secretariat should include:\n\u2022 reviewing and evaluating multinational company\nmanagement\u2019s internal systems of due diligence,\ncommunication and social performance;\n\u2022 conducting an annual Labour Information Audit on\nthe state of labour rights and standards in firms\ninvolved in transatlantic trade and investment (not-\ning, for example, whether firms have been found in\nviolation of national labour laws or international\nlabour standards to which both the EU and US have\nsubscribed);\n\u2022 collaborating with the ILO to advance the Decent\nWork Agenda, finding ways for the TEC to \u2018lead by\nexample\u2019 in fostering decent work in the context of\ntransatlantic trade and investment;\n\u2022 receiving complaints, conducting investigations and\nissuing findings and recommendations on alleged vio-\nlations of the code of conduct and its principles; and\n\u2022 recommending harmonised GSP and other preferen-\ntial trade policies for developing countries\u2019 exports to\nthe US and EU to ensure that ILO core labour stan-\ndards and other international human rights norms\nare respected in those countries (Compa and Meyer,\n2010).\nIn effect, what is needed to improve the workings of TER\nis the adoption of a broader political agenda in transat-\nlantic agreements, which provides all stakeholders with\nmotivational influence, together with the legal and insti-\ntutional structure to make such a programme work. In\nthe case presented above, including industrial and\nlabour standards in agreements would not even entail\nnew commitments by either the EU or the US but\nmerely the restatement of existing commitments in a\nnew context. Such a move would however reinforce the\nvalue of those commitments, especially if accompanied\nby the introduction of monitorial institutions.\nThe key principles outlined above are not limited to\nindustrial and labour relations issues but would also\nwork in other vital policy areas that should have a place\non the TER agenda, for instance environmental concerns.\nConclusions\nIn the absence of capable global governance structures,\ninterregionalism has an important governance role to\nplay in an increasingly multipolar world. The transatlantic\nrelationship is the most advanced interregional connec-\ntion and therefore an important role model. It must not\nbe allowed to fail. The thematic and institutional widen-\ning of the relationship \u2013 above all by including social\nand environmental issues \u2013 is fundamental to preventing\nthis from happening.\nThe strategic importance of the transatlantic economic\npartnership means that its historic dysfunctionality can-\nnot be ignored. This article has sought to explain that its\ndeficiencies lie in a too narrow agenda, focused almost\nexclusively on matters of deregulation, the continued\nconcentration on which is unlikely to create the neces-\nsary political ownership to make transatlantic economic\ncooperation more effective and live up to its potential\nand responsibility. Focusing on policy and institutions,\nwith reference to labour and industrial standards, this\narticle also argued that widening the TEC\u2019s mission to\nengage key stakeholders currently excluded and\nacknowledging the social dimension now largely ignored\nwould go some way to making TER work. To support\nthis, a series of institutional innovations, including the\ncreation of a new secretariat as a permanent contact\npoint, would be a practical requirement. The underlying\nrationale of these proposals could also be replicated in\nother crucial and underrepresented policy areas of the\ntransatlantic relationship. TER is a laboratory for eco-\nnomic governance mechanisms and we think that we\nhave outlined a worthwhile experiment.\nNotes\n1.
