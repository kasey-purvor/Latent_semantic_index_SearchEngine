Such gestures\npoint toward a space of intimate self-knowledge\nthat I call a \u201ccommunity of complicity,\u201d a concept\nderived from Michael Herzfeld\u2019s outline of \u201ccultural\nintimacy.\u201d I illustrate how such communities are\nconstituted with examples involving Chinese\ngeomancy (fengshui), funerary rituals, and\ncorruption. I contrast this approach with arguments\nmade about \u201cstate involution\u201d in China.

In the past, it was celebrated as shang liang: the\nraising of the ridge pole. Where I did fieldwork in 2006\u201307 in\nZhongba village in the Enshi region of Hubei province,1 a lot of\nconstruction activity and, hence, a lot of these celebrations were\ntaking place. The roofs of new houses are no longer built of lumber but\nof bricks and concrete, so the celebration is no longer called \u201craising the\nridge pole\u201d but \u201cpouring the concrete\u201d (E. dao ban\u2019r2). But, just as in former\ntimes, relatives, neighbors, and friends are invited for the event, where they\nare supposed to eat a meal and give small gifts of cash to the homeowner.\nThe celebration for the pouring of the concrete roof of Pan Dejun\u2019s new\nhouse was set for early August 2006. Over time, I had become a regular visi-\ntor at the Pan household, whichwas just a five-minutewalk from the village\nadministration building where I was living. Pan Dong, the family\u2019s 14-year-\nold son, had informed me well before the event that I should come to the\nnewhouse on day so and so for the inauguration. At the celebration, I rarely\nsaw his father, Pan Dejun, and when I did see him, he looked rather grim\nand nervous. His arm was bandaged: He had broken it when he fell from\nthe scaffolding at the construction site. After dinner, the guests went to the\nside rooms of the house to play mahjong, and I was dragged along as well\nto sit down and play. We played until late in the night; only then did I real-\nize that the concrete for the roof would not be poured until midnight. Pan\nDejun had hired a contractor to do it, and he arrived with a team of ten\nworkers at 11 p.m. They prepared their machines and started to carry the\nconcrete in buckets on shoulder poles up onto the formwork for the second\nfloor. I found it incomprehensible that they would start this work under the\nlight of their headlamps atmidnight, themost inconvenient time one could\nthink of. When I asked Pan Dejun to explain, he told me that the workers\nAMERICAN ETHNOLOGIST, Vol. 37, No. 3, pp. 539\u2013549, ISSN 0094-0496, online\nISSN 1548-1425.

But later, his son and\nan uncle told me in passing that the time was chosen be-\ncause the geomancer they had consulted had told them\nthey should do it at exactly this hour. It is still general prac-\ntice in the village to have a geomancer determine the ex-\nact hour for starting this work, to ensure astrological conso-\nnance and future prosperity.\nThe accident in which Pan Dejun had broken his arm\nwas, in this context, extremely significant. Pan was wor-\nried that it could have been an ominous sign, and this had\nmade him evenmore anxious to take ritual precaution. The\nday after the inauguration, Pan Dong told me that the ge-\nomancer (fengshui xiansheng) and a Daoist priest (daoshi)\nhad performed several incantations and rituals in the new\nhouse, of which Pan Dong did not understand much. He\njust remembered that the Daoist priest had killed a rooster\nand then sprayed its blood around thenewhouse. PanDong\nunderstood that this was meant to protect the new house\nagainst evil influences and ghosts. He added, \u201cThe people\nhere believe quite a lot of superstitions (mixin).\u201d\nPan Dong is a very bright boy and had just started\nhigher middle school when I left Zhongba in 2007. In\nDecember 2006, I had gone with him to the New Year\nshow staged by the middle school of Bashan township.\nHe had been given the main part in a comedy sketch, of\nwhich he was very proud. The sketch that followed his was\nabout a sick oldman who believes that a healer\u2013geomancer\n(yinyang xiansheng) can cure his illness. Against the advice\nof his children, who know that the healer is really a charla-\ntan, the old man entrusts himself to the healer\u2019s treatment.\nIn the end, the old man dies from the treatment. Performed\nby teenagers, the whole piece was supposed to be comical,\nand, in fact, the audience burst into laughter throughout\nit. Its obvious intent was to mock the credulity of people\nwho hire healers and geomancers. One teacher explained\nto me that the moral was to warn children and their par-\nents against the dangers of \u201cfeudal superstition\u201d (fengjian\nmixin), ofwhich such charlatans and geomancers are prime\nrepresentatives.\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nThis article is about what it means to live a local social-\nity if a good part of this sociality is continuously devalued\nin official discourse. In it, I attempt to explain why someone\nwould admit that \u201cpeople here believe in superstition\u201d and\nwhy such statements are often uttered as asides, stealthily,\nsometimes with overtones of embarrassment, cynicism, or\nirony.\nThe differences between official and vernacular, cen-\nter and periphery, and public and private are crucially im-\nportant in any social space and, so, are not unique to con-\ntemporary rural China. I start with my impression that the\ncontradictions between official representation and vernac-\nular practice sometimes assume extreme proportions, as\nexemplified in the story of Pan Dong. What one hears in the\nnews, what one is taught in school, and what is said in gov-\nernment announcements are generally quite different from,\nand sometimes diametrically opposed to, what people say\nand do at home. This is perhaps most apparent in connec-\ntion with those things that fall in the category of \u201csupersti-\ntion,\u201d such as the rituals of Daoist priests or the activities of\nChinese popular geomancy (fengshui). Similar ambiguities\ncharacterize family celebrations such as funerals and wed-\ndings and the relationships between officials and ordinary\npeople.\nThese ambiguities appear particularly salient when\npeople are confronted with an outsider who wants to in-\nquire about just such things. Covertness, embarrassment,\ncynicism, and irony are communicative strategies that\nmake it possible for them to acknowledge both sides of\nthe contradiction, to avoid confrontation, and to maintain\ncommunication. They are ways of doing \u201cface-work,\u201d as de-\nscribed by Erving Goffman (1955): actions that help one\navoid inconsistencies between the face one presents\u2014the\npositively attributed representation of a social person\u2014and\nwhat one actually does. Doing ethnography implies learn-\ning how to do face-work, that is, learning the conventional\nways of concealing and revealing such inconsistencies. In\nmy fieldwork, this meant, for instance, my learning how\nto talk about such issues as geomancy, family celebrations,\nand corruption. Countless awkward situations produced\nby my foolish questions and clumsy behavior assisted this\nlearning process.\nYet the communicative strategies people employed to\ndeal with the ambiguities in outside representations of local\nsociality point toward something beyond the awkwardness\nof doing ethnography, something that I describe by refer-\nence to Michael Herzfeld\u2019s concept of \u201ccultural intimacy.\u201d\nHerzfeld defines \u201ccultural intimacy\u201d as \u201cthe recognition of\nthose aspects of a cultural identity that are considered a\nsource of external embarrassment but that nevertheless\nprovide insiders with their assurance of common sociality\u201d\n(2005:3).\nA \u201ccoded tension\u201d exists between official representa-\ntions, generally linked to nation and state, and vernac-\nular forms in face-to-face communities; this tension ex-\npresses itself locally in embarrassment, cynicism, or irony.\nSuch are the reactions when \u201ccultural intimacy\u201d is exposed,\nand they can both confirm the official representation and\nsatirize it. Inasmuch as these expressions are shared and\ncommon, they bind people together in intimate spaces of\nself-knowledge.\nThe distinction between official and vernacular does\nnot coincide with social or political inequality: The power-\nful as well as those without power have a sense of cultural\nintimacy. Ethnographic and anecdotal accounts show how\nsharedmetaphors of \u201cthe state\u201d and \u201cthe people\u201d are strate-\ngically used by both bureaucrats and ordinary citizens.\n540\namet\u02d91271 amet2008.cls May 13, 2010 13:34\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\nCommunities of complicity \u0002 American Ethnologist\nThese \u201cpractical essentialisms\u201d employed in social inter-\naction exemplify what Herzfeld means by \u201csocial poetics,\u201d\npeople\u2019s creative deployment of allegedly stereotypical cul-\ntural attributes to achieve specific effects.\nWith this concept, Herzfeld draws heavily on the\nstudy of rhetoric and semiotics, and so one might wonder\nwhether the social poetics based on cultural intimacy are\nnot \u201cmerely\u201d symbolic. At least one reviewer of Herzfeld\u2019s\nconstruct submits this predictable criticism: It focuses on\ncultural and symbolic representation of state and nation,\nbut \u201cis that enough? Are there no \u2018objective-correlatives\u2019? If\nthere are, how on earth do we find them?Where nation and\nstate coincide, the answermay be, \u2018in the objective power of\nthe state\u2019\u201d (Cohen 1998:8). In other words, the gap between\nofficial representations and local sociality that is character-\nistic of cultural intimacy might be a consequence of pro-\ncesses of state formation that increase the \u201cobjective power\nof the state.\u201d\nNow, power is rather difficult to measure \u201cobjectively.\u201d\nPolitical scientists have attempted to do so by focusing\non the efficiency of state power and assessing \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cbad\u201d governance. In the case of the modern Chinese state,\nvarious observers have phrased the problems of state power\nand government efficiency in terms of \u201cstate involution\u201d\n(Duara 1987; Lu\u00a8 2000;Murphy 2007; Siu 1989a, 1989b;Wang\n1991). These observers deal with different periods of state\nmaking in modern Chinese history and reach slightly dif-\nferent conclusions. But they all share a basic line of argu-\nment: Efforts toward the formation of a modern state from\nthe republican era onward have not resulted in an efficient,\nformal bureaucracy and a transparent state machine but,\nrather, have reproduced and reinforced traditional modes\nof operation and patrimonialism. Although, on the outside,\na shiny fac\u00b8ade of formal rationality is constructed, inside a\npersonalistic cancer is growing. In all of these accounts, the\nstate or society is somewhere it actually should not be. To\nargue in this vein necessitates a vantage point from which\none actually knows where each should be, and this vantage\npoint is usually a Eurocentric concept of the nation-state.\nMost of these approaches are inspired by Clifford\nGeertz\u2019s (1963) description of \u201cagricultural involution\u201d in In-\ndonesia. The concept of \u201cinvolution\u201d has also been widely\nused in the economic history of China (Elvin 1973; Huang\n1990). In her outline of an alternative history of the \u201crice\neconomies\u201d of East Asia, the historian Francesca Bray calls\nfor approaches that go beyond the \u201clanguage of failure\u201d\nimplicit in concepts such as \u201cinvolution\u201d or \u201cgrowth with-\nout development\u201d (Elvin 1973). Both notions imply either\nan attribution of essential Otherness or a negative ac-\ncount of Chinese history, measured in terms of what was\nnot achieved when compared with European history (Bray\n1994:xiv). I take as a point of caution that concepts of \u201cinvo-\nlution,\u201d when applied to the state, might lead to the analyt-\nical pitfalls of Eurocentrism and orientalism.\nIn fact, the condemnation of traditionalist and person-\nalistic ties is not only characteristic of state-involution ap-\nproaches but it is also the most common public represen-\ntation of corruption in the People\u2019s Republic. Toward the\nend of this article, I argue that the ways in which this invo-\nlutionary cancer is officially denigrated and locally recog-\nnized are just as productive of shared commonality as are\npractices related to \u201csuperstition\u201d and fengshui. Those who\nshare a sense of the same intimacies form what might be\naptly called a \u201ccommunity of complicity.\u201d\nThese communities of complicity cut across the\nboundaries of state and society. The involution approaches\nall emphasize that state and society are deeply entangled; I\ngo one step further and envision an intimate state, one that\nis \u201ca constitutive force at the heart of the social world,\u201d in\nEric Mueggler\u2019s words (2001:5). Instead of correlating this\nsense of intimacy with the \u201cobjective power of the state,\u201d\nI try to relate it to a history of state formation in everyday\nlives. My examples are stories told about fengshui, about a\nConfucian discourse of \u201cmanners and etiquette\u201d (li) at a fu-\nneral, and about putatively corrupt local officials.\nFengshui\nFengshui is the traditional Chinese practice of geomancy,\na popular cosmology that connects astrological signs and\ncosmological elements with the shape of the lived land-\nscape. Interpreting the particular fengshui of a place aims\nto take advantage of and to adjust its positive \u201cenergy.\u201dMost\nlaypeople hire an expert geomancer (fengshui xiansheng or\nyinyang xiansheng) for this work. Although the practice has\nlong been suppressed by Chinese governments as \u201cfeudal\nsuperstition\u201d (fengjian mixin), it has remained immensely\npopular, especially in the countryside. In Zhongba, as of\n2007, almost everyone who prepared to build a new house\nor a tomb consulted a geomancer, who helped to situate the\nhouse or grave according to the fengshui of its site.\nFengshui is closely linked to the fate (mingyun) of a\nfamily and a household, but sometimes it is extended and\nlinked to a lineage, a hamlet, or even an entire township.\nOne of the main aims in Chinese geomancy and divination\nis to influence and manipulate, to some extent, the cosmo-\nlogical forces at work in people\u2019s lives. The knowledge of\nfengshui can, thus, be instrumentalized by the powerful to\nimpinge on the aspirations of others. In what follows, I re-\ncount three stories about powerful representatives of the\nstate who used fengshui. These stories take place right at\nthe interface of official and vernacular discourses and ex-\nemplify the ambiguities of the state and its representatives\nin local society.\nThe first story is about the fengshui of a small val-\nley that opens into the northwestern side of the triangular\nBashan plain. Over the centuries, the stream in this valley\nhas formed a deep meandering channel between rugged\n541\namet\u02d91271 amet2008.cls May 13, 2010 13:34\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\nAmerican Ethnologist \u0002 Volume 37 Number 3 August 2010\nhills and rocks. Where one enters the valley, coming from\nthe plain, one passes the Chicken Branch hill on the left\nside. People say that, long ago, this hill was much higher,\nthat it had rocks on top, and that it provided the valley be-\nlow it with very good fengshui. TheGong family lived in sev-\neral hamlets in the valley and was said to prosper because\nof its good fengshui. Talent and ability (rencai) abounded\nin the valley, the sons of the Gong family became high of-\nficials, and the Gong family altogether was very wealthy. At\nthe time of the Qianlong emperor, the prosperity and suc-\ncess of the family aroused the envy of a mandarin in the\ncapital of the prefecture, Shinan (nowEnshi). Hence, he had\nhis henchmen demolish the rocks on top of Chicken Branch\nand dig a hole (quekou) into the summit of the hill. There-\nafter, no member of the Gong family succeeded in the im-\nperial exams, and the family declined.\nThe story of theGong familymight have been told in al-\nmost the same way in imperial China. In fact, many stories\nof this kind have been documented in southeastern China\nand Taiwan. They generally speak of the ambiguous rela-\ntionship between center and periphery, as an outside power\ndestroys the cosmological order of a locality. Yet, at the same\ntime, local levels of \u201ccivilization\u201d and ancestral wealth are\npresented in terms of the center, that is, success in the im-\nperial examinations.\nLike other stories about the distant past, the story of the\nGong family was told to me with a certain folkloristic fla-\nvor: It did not really matter how truthful this story was, and\nI could not sense that it hadmuch connection with the cur-\nrent state of the Gong family. Because such stories were sit-\nuated in the distant past, no one found them embarrassing\nin any sense.\nThe style and tone of narration change verymuchwhen\na story comes closer to the concerns of the present. An ap-\nparently true story about the same valley is somewhat simi-\nlar to the legend of the Gong family. In the past, after strong\nrainfalls, the stream in this valley often flooded the fields\nthat bordered it. During one campaign of the Cultural Revo-\nlution,3 the cadres of two production brigades had the idea\nof opening several tunnels into the area\u2019s rock formations,\nso that the stream would flow in a straight line and the\nfields would remain dry. With the help of dynamite deto-\nnations, three long tunnels were opened through the rocks,\nand the river left its old bed and flowed through them. Lo-\ncals initially opposed the tunnel project, arguing that it was\nnot worth the effort. But the most serious disadvantage, in\ntheir view, was that it would destroy the fengshui of the val-\nley.4 Yet no one ever directly admitted this to me. During\nthe spring festival period in 2006, I accompanied a family\nfrom Zhongba on a visit to relatives in the Gong family. We\nspent all afternoon in conversation, and oneman related in\nmuch detail the story of the three tunnels. Everyone agreed\nthat their excavation had been awaste ofmanpower and re-\nsources, but no one spoke about the negative influence the\nproject might have had on the fengshui of the valley. Only\none elderly uncle quietly mentioned that \u201cin the past they\nsaid that it might have destroyed the fengshui.\u201d I asked fur-\nther and got the answer that \u201cback in those days, they ob-\nviously could not have said that.\u201d Later on, the friend I was\nwith confirmed tome thatmany old people in the valley are\nconvinced that their bad luck comes from the bad fengshui\nof the valley. A minor official in his thirties, he talked about\nthese beliefs in a rather disapproving way, half condemning\nsuch \u201csuperstition,\u201d half mocking it.\nThe ambiguities of fengshui have a long history. In fact,\nlocal governments in imperial times were often suspicious\nof popular cosmologies, potential heterodoxies, and here-\nsies (Bruun 2003:ch. 2). Yet the imperial state almost never\nwent so far as to directly intervene in local practices; in-\nstead, it favored gentle guidance by \u201ccorrection\u201d and \u201cexem-\nplar\u201d (Hamilton 1989). Since the beginning of the 20th cen-\ntury, practices like fengshui have been broadly devalued by\neducated elites, but they have remained common among\nordinary people. In the Maoist era, local \u201csuperstition\u201d was\nfervently denounced and systematically attacked.\nThe legend about the malicious mandarin who de-\nstroyed the fengshui of the Gong family hamlets exempli-\nfies the common assumption that the powerful andwealthy\ntried to manipulate fengshui and the belief that they ac-\ntually must have done so rather successfully\u2014\u201cif not, how\ncould they have become powerful and wealthy in the first\nplace?\u201d This kind of circular argument sometimes assumed\nironic or even grotesque proportions: Repeatedly, older\npeasants toldme that the power and success ofMao Zedong\nand other leaders was really due to their intimate knowl-\nedge and versatile manipulation of fengshui. One famous\nstory relates that during the civil war between Nationalists\nand Communists, Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Na-\ntionalist Party, tried to find the tomb ofMao Zedong\u2019s father\nso that he could dig out the remains and demolish the tomb.\nIn this way, he could destroy the fengshui of the Mao family\nand ensure the future misfortune of Mao Zedong in partic-\nular. But when the neighbors of theMao family heard about\nthe plan, they removed the name badges from the tombs\nin the village so that Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s soldiers could not\nfind the tomb. In anger, the soldiers wildly destroyed several\ntombs in the village, a most outrageous and horrible action,\nas devastating a family tomb equals destroying the integrity\nand prosperity of a family line altogether. The fengshui sur-\nrounding the tombs of the Mao family, however, was pre-\nserved and continued to provide excellent fortune for the\nfamily. By contrast, the infamy of digging out the graves of\ninnocent families led tomisfortune for, and the eventual de-\nfeat of, Chiang and the Nationalists.\nIn recent years, fengshui has become a respected ob-\nject of study for architects, historians, and even design-\ners in mainland China. Many books and experts have tried\nto prove that fengshui is really \u201cscientific\u201d (kexue) and,\n542\namet\u02d91271 amet2008.cls May 13, 2010 13:34\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\nCommunities of complicity \u0002 American Ethnologist\ntherefore, does not contradict the scientistic worldview pro-\nmulgated by party and state. Yet, in the countryside, peo-\nple never publicly make references to fengshui and related\npractices like astrology and divination. They speak about\nthem only in private and almost always with a somewhat\nironic undertone. In the Maoist era, exposing the fengshui\npractices of others would have amounted to serious de-\nnouncement, and many people still relate to them in secre-\ntive, partly embarrassed, ways.\nAnother practice that was severely controlled and\npartly forbidden under Maoism was staging huge banquets\nfor family celebrations, in particular, weddings and funer-\nals. These events are closely linked to geomantic practices.\nAt a wedding, the bowing of a couple in front of the ances-\ntral tablets in themain roomof the bridegroom\u2019s house con-\nfirmed and reenacted the central axis of the house, which,\nideally, was adjusted to the fengshui of its surroundings. At\na funeral, the coffin was placed along this central axis, and\nthe tombwas also located according to fengshui. Everything\npeople did on these ritual occasions, from eating at the ban-\nquet tables to offering presents of goods and cash to the\nhosts, was supposed to conform to the rules of propriety\nand etiquette, which Confucian texts call \u201cli.\u201d The propriety\nof li, however, is nowadays sometimes just as embarrassing\nas fengshui.\nThe embarrassment of li\nOne of the first terms that I learned in the local dialect\nwas chijiu, pronounced \u201cqi jiu,\u201d which literally means \u201cto\neat wine,\u201d that is, to attend a banquet. More specifically, it\nmeans to attend another\u2019s family celebration, like a wed-\nding, a funeral, a housewarming party, the birth of a child,\na birthday, or a celebration for passing the entry examina-\ntions to the university or the army.Of these, themost impor-\ntant life-cycle events are weddings and funerals, called \u201cred\nand white celebrations\u201d (hongbai xishi), according to the\nsymbolic colors for happiness (red) and mourning (white).\nSuch celebrations are held at the house of the host family\nor, for families in the market town of Bashan or in the city\nof Enshi, in a restaurant. Attending a banquet implies not\nonly sharing an abundant meal but also offering the host a\npresent, which nowadays is usually cash. The family that is\n\u201chosting the wine\u201d (E. zhengjiu) has to prepare well in ad-\nvance. Generally, the day of the celebration is chosen with\nthe help of a diviner, who calculates the most propitious\ndate and hour, according to the \u201ceight characters\u201d (ba zi) of\nthe year, month, day, and hour of the births of themain par-\nticipants. Before the celebration, the host invites neighbors\nand friends to \u201chelp\u201d (bang mang) in hosting the event.\nAll these actions necessitate proper behavior and for-\nmality. The established rules (guiju) and etiquette (liyi or\nlijie) at such occasions are particular forms of li, or ritual.\nSimilar to the difficulty of defining ritual, li eludes easy\ndefinition. In contemporary Chinese, li can mean many\nthings. It is part of the expressions for politeness (limao),\netiquette and custom (liyi, lijie, or lisu), worship (libai), and\ngift (liwu). In the popular expression \u201ccourtesy demands\nreciprocity\u201d (lishang wanglai), li means also the propriety\ninherent in reciprocal relationships. Just like the practices\nof fengshui, the expressions of li are characterized by ambi-\nguities. Here I give an example related to the funeral of the\nfather of a high official.\nSun Jundong was one of themost successful officials in\nBashan township. After three years as the party secretary of\nthe township, he was elevated to vice party secretary in a\nneighboring county, the next higher rank in the hierarchy of\nparty and government. In the spring of 2007, I had the op-\nportunity to attend the funeral of his father. Two neighbors\nin Zhongba toldme that theywould play the shawm (suona)\nand drums in a funeral band and asked me if I wanted to\njoin them.\nThe home of the Sun family is in one of the most re-\nmote villages of Bashan township, about two-hours drive by\ncar into the mountains from the market of Bashan. On the\ndirt road, we saw numerous sport utility vehicles and the\nblack Audis and Volkswagens that are used by government\nofficials and businessmen. We attended the last night of the\nfuneral, and from the moment we arrived at 5 p.m. until\nlate in the evening, the popping noise of firecrackers did not\ncease for a singlemoment. According to local custom, about\nthree-dozen neighbors and relatives help prepare the food\nand host the guests at a funeral. At this funeral, however,\nthere were about one hundred helpers, who all had their\nnames listed on a beautiful painted poster on onewall of the\nhouse. On another wall, a programwas posted detailing the\nperformances and rituals for the evening, all written in fine\ncalligraphy. According to local tradition, the coffin is laid out\nin the central room of the house, which is called the \u201chall\nof filial piety\u201d (xiaotang) during the funerary period. The\nhall in this case was richly ornamented with carved bam-\nboo sticks and colored paper, various paintings, and sev-\neral huge tablets that described the life of the deceased in\npoems. All this was the work of teacher Lei, a well-known\n\u201cman of culture\u201d (wenren) and former head of the \u201coffice for\nculture\u201d in a neighboring township. He also led the perfor-\nmances and rituals in the evening, which included speeches\nin classical Chinese; amourning ceremony, duringwhich 24\nmusic bandsmarched and played; songs and couplets sung\nto all close relatives and important guests; mourning songs\nfor the deceased and his family; mourning dances around\nthe coffin; and lion dances.\nThis was by far the biggest and most lavish funeral that\nI had seen during my time in Bashan. It was also a huge\nshow of power and money. Normally at a Chinese funeral,\nthe guests give presents and money to the host, and these\ngifts are listed in a red book. People always stress the impor-\ntance of reciprocity in these exchanges: When donors host\n543\namet\u02d91271 amet2008.cls May 13, 2010 13:34\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\nAmerican Ethnologist \u0002 Volume 37 Number 3 August 2010\ntheir own future family celebrations, they expect to receive\nequivalent amounts from those to whom they have previ-\nously given. At the funeral of Sun Jundong\u2019s father, around\n70 thousand yuan was given,5 according to the red book.\nThat amount is immense compared with the conventional\nsums that ordinary farmers deal with: Ten thousand yuan is\nan above-average annual income for a family in the region,\nand it is also the average sum of money received at a wed-\nding or a funeral.\nSuch celebrations were the targets of Maoist policies\nagainst \u201cfeudal superstition\u201d throughout the revolutionary\nera, and their suppression has only slowly loosened since\nthe 1980s. Since then, there have been huge increases in\nthe sums of money and presents given at funerals and\nweddings. Intermittently, the governmentwages campaigns\nagainst the \u201cwaste\u201d of the practice of giving monetary\npresents. In the spring of 2007, for instance, the city gov-\nernment of Enshi engaged in an intensive campaign to curb\nthe \u201cwaste\u201d of money and the \u201cimmorality\u201d of such \u201cback-\nward\u201d customs. Local television programs disparaged ex-\ncessive gift giving, and all party members had to partici-\npate in education sessions about the \u201cbackwardness\u201d of this\npractice.\nMy attendance at the Sun family funeral surely pro-\nduced some uncertainties and awkwardness. On the one\nhand, I was a foreign guest, and everyone in the local gov-\nernment and most ordinary people in the surrounding vil-\nlages knew about my presence in the area and that I walked\naround the villages, observing, talking to, and asking odd\nquestions of local residents. On the other hand, I was not\ninvited to this celebration, and at some points during the\nevening it was not clear to me whether I was welcome. My\nneighbors whowere playingmusic had said that I should go\nand pay my respects to the former secretary of Bashan. But\nSun Jundong himself did not say a single word to me dur-\ning the night, even after I had given a short funeral oration\nat the invitation of the ceremonial coordinator. Some rela-\ntives of the Sun family, businessmen in Enshi and Wuhan,\nwere extremely friendly to me and told me I should film the\nevent. A cameraman among the helpers was already filming\nit. When I asked him if it would be possible for me to get a\ncopy of his film, he said that, unfortunately, it was reserved\nfor the members of the Sun family.\nClearly, Sun Jundong faced several dilemmas here. On\nthe one hand, he had to present himself as the impeccable\nleader, representative of the highmorals of the party and the\ngovernment. In this case, he had to present this image not\nonly to locals but also to a foreigner. On the other hand, he\nwas expected to live up to the demands of filial piety (xiao),\nand he and his family were expected to engage in what was\nconsidered proper (li) and virtuous (daode) behavior after\nthe death of his father. He obviously tried to do both and\nto represent his family in both respects. In addition, the fu-\nneral gave him the opportunity to receive huge amounts of\nmoney from officials trying to establish relationships of pa-\ntronage with him. After all, he was the highest official in the\ntownship and is now a powerful cadre at the county level\u2014\na most important man for all in the lower government\noffices to know. Last, but not least, the funeral was the occa-\nsion for many officials, friends, relatives, and business part-\nners to reciprocate for the gifts that he had given them in\nthe past.\nWhen the funeral went through Bashan\u2019s gossip mills,\nthe accusation that, by holding such a massive funeral, Sun\nJundongwas really engaging in \u201cfeudal\u201d and \u201ccorrupt\u201d prac-\ntices frequently came up. A week after the funeral, the topic\nwas mentioned among the officials of Zhongba village, and\nTan Tao, the then party secretary of the village, asked me\nin front of some other officials if I had gone to the funeral.\nLater, when we were having a cigarette together, Tan Tao\nasked again, \u201cHowwas it at the funeral? Don\u2019t you think that\nit was really luxurious and decadent (haochi)?\u201d Not waiting\nfor my answer, he switched into dialect and said to the vil-\nlage accountant that \u201cpeople of Sun\u2019s rank should not en-\ngage in these kind of activities.\u201dMy impressionwas that Tan\nTao could not hide some Schadenfreude about Sun having\nexposed himself to my prying presence.\nA couple of days later, I met teacher Song and had\na long conversation with him about the funeral. Teacher\nSong is retired and works now as the janitor of the pri-\nmary school. Most of the day he sits in a little lodge next to\nthe gate of the school and reads classical novels or books\nabout the heroes of the revolution. This afternoon, I told\nhim about my impressions of the funeral and also about\nmy insecurity regarding the reaction of the Sun family to\nmy presence. He said that everyone in Bashan knew that the\nSun funeral was surely the biggest one that Bashan had seen\nin its history\u2014\u201csince the beginning of the world\u201d [pangu\nkai tian yilai], he said, smiling. He was not referring to\nthe pomp that I had seen, the banquet and the musicians,\nwhich I thoughtwas themeasurement. He knewof other fu-\nnerals at which about forty bands of musicians had played,\ncompared with only 24 at Sun Jundong\u2019s house. The bands\nare only sent by the daughters and sons-in-law of the de-\nceased\u2019s family and, hence, show how many affines some-\none has. What people in Bashan were really talking about\nthese days, teacher Song said, was the amount of money\ngiven. Most of the secretaries and higher-level officials in\nBashan had given presents; and most of them surely had\nnot appeared at the funeral itself, but only those closest to\nthe family, teacher Song estimated. Accordingly,muchmore\nmoney must have been given than the roughly 70 thousand\nyuan recorded in the red book of presents. Song said that, in\nthe past, \u201cthe thunder was big and the rain was little,\u201d but\nnow \u201cthe thunder is little, and the rain is big\u201d [lei xiang xiao,\nyu lai da], meaning that now there is less noise and pomp\nbut more of the rain of money. Song confirmed that Sun\nJundong would have been worried about my coming and\n544\namet\u02d91271 amet2008.cls May 13, 2010 13:34\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\nCommunities of complicity \u0002 American Ethnologist\nwatching all that money flow, fearing that I could report it.\nAnd then he told me about several cases of officials in simi-\nlar situations who had been convicted of corruption.\nThe funeral of Sun Jundong\u2019s father illustrates that cul-\ntural intimacy is something quite different from the cultural\nresistance of the subaltern. The one who was embarrassed\nin this case was one of themost powerful local leaders. Both\nlocal villagers and government officials shared a common\ndiscourse about propriety and a common understanding\nthat one\u2019s representation to outsiders and the local practice\nof holding family celebrations stand in a tense relationship.\nWhat is crucial is how the contradictions are negotiated. In\ntheir demeanor and speech at the funeral, Sun Jundong and\nhis guests enacted local ideals of proper behavior: in this\ncase, the ritual of a funeral, which is one of the most impor-\ntant services children provide to their parents, expressing\ntheir filial piety (xiao). Hosts and guests are supposed to be-\nhave according to rules and etiquette that can be summa-\nrized under the header of Confucian \u201cpropriety\u201d (li). But in\nthe privacy of everyday talk, both villagers and fellow cadres\nwould point out how corrupt this behavior is.\nIn the conclusion to her book Gifts, Favors, and Ban-\nquets, Mayfair Mei-hui Yang (1994:317\u2013320) tells a very\nsimilar story of a rural cadre named Zhao. After the huge fu-\nnerary celebration for Zhao\u2019s father, a rival official accuses\nZhao of \u201ccorrupt and feudal\u201d activities. Zhao is arrested\nand subjected to party discipline. But the locals all support\nhim and plead his case in front of higher government\nofficials. For Yang, this is an example of ritual being \u201ca\nself-organizing Vehicle of the Minjian\u201d (1994:317). In her\ninterpretation, the minjian, or the popular realm of renqing\n(human feeling) ethics and guanxi (relationship) produc-\ntion, is an emerging independent social realm opposed to\nthe anonymous exertion of state power. Let me quote at\nlength from her interpretation of the events following the\nfuneral of Zhao\u2019s father:\nFrom the people\u2019s point of view, the funeral was not a\n\u201cbackward\u201d or \u201cfeudal\u201d institution, nor was Zhao using\nhis position to extort money and gifts from them, but\nit provided an important social occasion for repaying\ndebts owed or initiated a new round of debt relation-\nship with Zhao and his family. The local people sought\nto transform their relationship with Cadre Zhao from\nan impersonal, administrative, ruler-to-governed top-\ndown relationship into a personal renqing relationship\nof giving and repaying. It is noteworthy that, counter\nto the official policy of de-emphasizing and sometimes\nbanning rituals, the local people attach much social\nsignificance to funerary rituals and feasts. The ritual\nprovides a staging ground for the practice of renqing\nwith an official, . . . so that there is a clear association\nbetween ritual or feast and renqing, and between rit-\nual, renqing, and good government.\nZhao himself is a cadre whose attitude toward his job\nis tinged with a heavy renqing perspective and who al-\nlows himself to enter into debt relationships with the\npeople. That is why when he got in trouble with his su-\nperiors, so many people organized themselves to sup-\nport him. In this action the people were not just de-\nfending Zhao\u2019s personal integrity, but also a certain\napproach to government and the importance of ritual\nin their social life. In rural Wenzhou, minjian forces\nhave begun to organize themselves and even to prevail\nagainst the state, and these forces include the discourse\nand practice of renqing and ritual. [Yang 1994:319\u2013320]\nNote how Yang makes use of the category of \u201cthe\npeople\u201d to denote a unified body who fight for a \u201ccertain\napproach to government and the importance of ritual in\nsocial life.\u201d This approach is characterized by personalized\nrelationships of renqing and guanxi, and it is diametrically\nopposed to the impersonal administrative relationships of\nthe state. In my example, the people did not have such a\nuniform judgment of the high official who staged a huge\nfuneral. Both the popular realm (which Yang calls by its\nChinese name, \u201cminjian\u201d) and the state discourse are much\nmore fragmented. Both ordinary people and government\nofficials use elements of vernacular and state discourses.\nI also subscribe to a binary opposition, but it is not that\nbetween \u201cthe local people\u201d and \u201cthe state\u201d but that be-\ntween an official, outside representation and a vernacular,\ninside practice. At the funeral of Sun Jundong, local villagers\nand officials were partaking in both discourses: Some locals\nwere admiring the pompof the funeral, whereas otherswere\ncriticizing it and denouncing the corruption of local offi-\ncials. Similarly, officials were divided on the ways in which\nthe funeral should be interpreted; whereas many had to of-\nfer monetary presents, some were also quite cynical about\nSun, especially when talking in private.\nMost of the practices identified as \u201cConfucian propri-\nety\u201d (li) had been thoroughly condemned during theMaoist\nera. The \u201cConfucian doctrine\u201d (lijiao) was an instrument of\nlandlords and capitalists to oppress the peasants. Hence, all\nof these practices were tightly controlled until the 1980s.\nAlthough political control is much looser now, a consider-\nable propaganda effort still attempts to curb such \u201cwaste\u201d\n(puzhang langfei) linked to \u201cbackward\u201d (luohou) practices.\nThe condemnation of thiswaste ties inwell with heightened\nconcerns about cadre corruption.\nCommunities of complicity\nThe era of \u201creform and opening\u201d that started in the 1980s\nhas been characterized by growing concerns about corrup-\ntion. The corruption of local officials was a favorite topic\nof villagers in their conversations with me, second only to\nthe weather. Taxes and fees levied on private enterprises,\n545\namet\u02d91271 amet2008.cls May 13, 2010 13:34\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\nAmerican Ethnologist \u0002 Volume 37 Number 3 August 2010\nseveral government enterprises, and, recently, land expro-\npriations close to the township where a \u201cdevelopment dis-\ntrict\u201d (kaifa qu) is being built provide high revenue for the\nlocal government. Locals frequently alleged that the re-\nsponsible officials have pocketed part of this revenue.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the general agricultural tax\nand the countless fees collected from farmers had led to\nmany conflicts and, in some regions, to collective protests\n(Lu\u00a8 1997; Perry 1999). In recent years, these taxes and fees\nhave been widely reduced, and in 2003 the general agricul-\ntural tax was completely abolished. National policies have\nturned now toward paying subsidies to farmers. In Bashan,\none particular support payment is given to tea farmers\nvia the \u201cturn farmland into forest\u201d (tuigeng huanlin) pro-\ngram. Tea plantations conveniently count as \u201cproductive\nforest,\u201d so farmers who have dried out their paddy fields\nand planted tea shrubs receive a subsidy for a certain pe-\nriod. That is but one minor part of all the support pay-\nments that local governments in recognized \u201cpoor districts\u201d\n(pinkun diqu) receive from the provincial and national lev-\nels. All this is well known among local farmers, and themost\ncommon local commentary about it is that the govern-\nment hierarchy, from the central government downward,\nworks like a funnel with several sieves. At every level, offi-\ncials enrich themselves from the lump sums that the cen-\ntral government is investing, and, therefore, almost nothing\nreaches the farmers.\nConnected to this way of seeing the governmental hier-\narchy is the idea that the higher up one looks on the gov-\nernmental ladder, the better the officials are. Frequently,\nlocal villagers pointed out to me that the central govern-\nment, represented by ChairmanHu Jintao and PremierWen\nJiabao, does actually care about the peasants and promotes\ngood policies. Yet further down the government ladder, of-\nficials get increasingly worse. In many people\u2019s view, the\nworst ones are the cadres of the township level\u2014the offi-\ncials that are in closest everyday contact with ordinary peo-\nple. Everyday interactions with township officials are tied to\neconomic and social interests, whereas the relationship of\nfarmers with the central state is more symbolic and moral\nand is mediated at various levels. Guo Xiaolin (2001:436ff.)\nhas described this as a \u201cbifurcated state,\u201d in which people\nkeep placing hope and confidence in the central govern-\nment, even when local government becomes increasingly\npredatory.\nEven though people often complain about local offi-\ncials and have very pointed opinions about them, they need\nto approach them about identification cards, marriage cer-\ntificates, permits to build houses, family planning issues,\nland conflicts, and so on. When complicated issues are at\nstake, locals prefer a personal relationship and contact with\nan official. My neighbor Liu Dawei, for instance, often lec-\ntured me on the \u201cart of relationship making\u201d (guanxi xue).\nWhen he was planning to build a new house in the sum-\nmer of 2007, the village officials initially opposed his plan.\nHe then invited the vice secretary of the township govern-\nment for several meals at the best restaurant in Bashan and\noffered him several boxes of expensive cigarettes. Liu Dawei\nalso pointed out to me that he had chosen to cultivate a re-\nlationship with this secretary because he shares the same\nsurname with him, even though he is not a direct relative.\nThe village government eventually granted Liu Dawei per-\nmission to build his new house.\nContrary to such personal ties with officials, govern-\nment propaganda continuously emphasizes impartiality\nand formal equality. Concomitantly, party education pro-\ngrams focus on raising the \u201cquality\u201d (suzhi) of cadres and\ntheir behavior (Murphy 2007). At the same time, locals\nlike Liu Dawei, or the neighbors and officials offering cash\nto Sun Jundong, are clearly aware that it is important to\nhave a personal bond with officials, in which human feel-\ning (renqing) is properly expressed through gifts. From the\nperspective of some academic observers, such phenom-\nena are aspects of \u201cstate involution\u201d in contemporary China\n(Lu\u00a8 2000; Siu 1989a 1989b; Wang 1991). Lu\u00a8 Xiaobo, for in-\nstance, points out an \u201corganizational involution\u201d within the\nChinese party state. He defines this involution as\na process whereby a revolutionary party, while adopt-\ning and expanding many \u201cmodern\u201d (i.e., rational, for-\nmal, impersonal) structures, . . . fails to adapt itself to,\nand be transformed by, the routinization and bureau-\ncratization that characterize modern bureaucracy; at\nthe same time, it is unable to maintain its original dis-\ntinctive competence and identity. Its members make\nadjustments and adaptations neither through revolu-\ntionary ideologies nor modern institutions and prac-\ntices, but through reinforced and elaborated traditional\nmodes of operation. [2000:22]\nLu\u00a8 adds that such \u201cneotraditionalism\u201d produces \u201cdisil-\nlusioned, status-conscious, and undisciplined cadres, who\nin themanner of pre-revolutionary . . . local officials, put the\ninterests of more intimate secondary and primary groups\nabove those of the regime\u201d (2000:23). Rachel Murphy has\nrecently used Lu\u00a8\u2019s framework to analyze how party edu-\ncation campaigns work to maintain this \u201corganizational\ninvolution\u201d: The campaigns deflect systemic critique and,\ninstead, blame the problems of corruption on the ethical\nmisbehavior of individuals. She concludes that the \u201critu-\nalization\u201d of the education campaigns reproduces the top-\ndown party hierarchy and the personalistic networks within\nthis hierarchy (Murphy 2007).\nIt is not only academic observers who see person-\nalistic networks and informal dealings fulfilling systemic\nfunctions in a supposedly impersonal bureaucracy. Both\nvillagers and cadres are well aware that one\u2019s personal rela-\ntionswith officials are themost important and reliable ones.\nBut they do not pronounce that in public.

The embarrassed or ironic\nways in which they make such admissions indicate shared\nunderstandings of local mechanisms of power. Such local\nknowledge (e.g., of li) is transfigured into stereotypes and\nessentialisms both by ordinary people and by academics.\nYet social actors make strategic use of these essentialisms\nand sometimes reject them forthrightly.\nWhat emerges behind this symbolic struggle is an\nintimate space of common knowledge, or a \u201ccommu-\nnity of complicity.\u201d Belonging to such a community de-\npends on the skill with which a social actor can make\nuse of practical essentialisms. Only the most unskilled ac-\ntor straightforwardly and earnestly admits that \u201cwe believe\nin superstition.\u201d The moral, capable social actor, however,\nuses gestures of embarrassment, of irony, and of cynicism\nto prove his or her belonging to those who know.\nI do not mean the notion of \u201ccommunities of com-\nplicity\u201d to imply that the object of this intimate knowledge\nand complicity is a true neotraditionalism, more \u201ctrue\u201d\nthan the official representation of a rationalized political\nsystem and a modern citizenry. Indeed, the logical conse-\nquence of the involution argument is that the modern and\nrational is only a false mask, barely concealing the neo-\ntraditionalist \u201ctruth.\u201d In my argument, both the modernist\nrepresentation and traditionalist self-knowledge are true.\nCommunities of complicity are formed by those who share\nan intimate knowledge of the boundaries\u2014the faces\u2014of\nmodernism and traditionalism.\nConclusion\nI started with the apparent contradiction between official\nrepresentation and vernacular practice in the case of Pan\nDong, whose father invited a geomancer for the inaugura-\ntion of the family\u2019s new house and who laughed together\nwith his classmates about a healer\u2013geomancer at the school\nshow. This tension between the official and the vernacular\nleads to a rueful recognition of local sociality that I call, with\nHerzfeld, \u201ccultural intimacy.\u201d The stories told about feng-\nshui illustrate a certain ambiguity between peripheral local-\nity and center characteristic of both late-imperial and con-\ntemporary China. But the sense of cultural intimacy linked\nto fengshui and other superstitions was hugely intensified\nby the state formation processes of the 20th century, in par-\nticular during the Maoist era. In the embarrassment of li,\nor ritual, are the remnants of a Maoist discourse that vi-\nolently denigrated Confucianism. Cultural intimacy is not\nsomething limited to the little people or the subaltern\u2014\nit is also felt by officials, like the county secretary, Sun\nJundong. Just like ordinary villagers, the powerful also en-\ngage in social poetics, that is, in the practical and strategic\nuse of essentialisms. My examples have shown how peo-\nple used essentialisms of fengshui, of li, and of corruption.\nI have pointed out that, in fact, a knowledge of and fa-\nmiliarity with practices that others might call \u201ccorruption\u201d\nor \u201cinvolution\u201d is common among officials and villagers\nand that this shared knowledge defines communities of\ncomplicity.\nThe valuation and control of much everyday action\nis now characterized by a tension between powerful out-\nside representations, promulgated in schools and govern-\nment offices and by modern media (in particular, newspa-\npers and the Internet but also the \u201cMaoist modern\u201d of wall\nposters, scrolls, and loudspeaker announcements) and an\nintimate space of local sociality that more or less contra-\ndicts what is written and announced in those representa-\ntions. Because of this tension, local socialities are felt to be\n\u201cintimate\u201d spaces. If the lived contradictions are pointed\nout, or made visible, a local\u2019s first reaction can be an awk-\nward smile. With a fellow insider, it is just as possible to be-\ncome ironic: The existence of such lived contradictions is\nactually quite clear tomost participants and to the initiated.\nHowever, embarrassment, irony, and \u201cun-plain\u201d speech and\nexpression are not understood by everyone and so repro-\nduce the boundaries of an intimate space. Yet, sometimes,\nawkwardness and irony can turn into utter frustration. This\noccurs when the tension between outward representation\nand intimate practice becomes unbearable. What, more\nthan anything else, characterizes the attitudes and posi-\ntions toward practices like geomancy, ritual, and corrup-\ntion is a discursive uncertainty. And this is perhaps the\nbiggest difference from earlier times: I imagine that, up\nto the 1930s, it was close to impossible in the villages of\nBashan for someone to crack a joke about fengshui or about\nthe principle of li. Now these topics have to be treated\nwith irony.\nMy interpretation of spaces of intimacy produced by\nthe relationship between local sociality and the state is also\nbased on many embarrassing experiences I had in China.\nJust like any outsider trying to adapt to an unfamiliar so-\ncial environment, I often felt that I had to be careful and\ncautious to avoid awkwardness arising out of a conflict\nof perceptions. The moments of potential embarrassment\nand felt intimacy were acute\u2014at least in my experience\u2014\nwhen I broached issues related to so-called superstition,\nparticipation in family celebrations, and dealing with lo-\ncal cadres, not to mention the topics of human rights,\ndemocracy, and corruption. In all these instances, I very\nmuch felt the necessity to be sensitive and cautious in my\nactions.\nOf course, the arrival of a foreigner often leads to situ-\nations of awkwardness, embarrassment, and irony. Ethnog-\nraphy is, after all, an intrusion into the intimate spaces of\nothers, and not only of individuals but also of nation-states.\n547\namet\u02d91271 amet2008.cls May 13, 2010 13:34\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\nAmerican Ethnologist \u0002 Volume 37 Number 3 August 2010\nYet I believe that such anxieties were not merely relevant\nto my own interactions with people in Zhongba.

It creates communities\nof complicity, communities of those who share an aware-\nness of intimate spaces that are marked by embarrassment,\nirony, and cynicism at their boundaries.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.
