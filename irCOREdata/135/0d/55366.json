Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al                            \n \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nThe ageing of alcohol beverages is \ntraditionally performed using oak wood \nbarrels as the extraction of key \ncompounds from the wood produces \ndesirable changes in the composition of \nwines or spirits. Oak wood is mainly \ncomposed of three large insoluble \npolymers, cellulose, hemicellulose and \nlignin but it also contains different \ncompounds with lower molecular \nweight such as volatile and non-volatile \nacids, sugars, steroids, terpenes, volatile \nphenols, lactones, etc. [1-3], which can \nbe extracted by ethanol-water mixtures \nin very different ratios depending on \nthe alcohol content of the extractant. \nThe heating and charring operations \nmade during the manufacture of oak \nwood barrels modify the macromol-\necular structure of wood, giving place \nto a degradation of polysaccharides and \npolyphenols and to the appearance of \nnew classes of volatile substances such \nas pyrazines, furans, phenols, etc. Sev-\neral studies have demonstrated changes \nin the composition of oak when it is \ntoasted over a wood fire [4,5]. Small \namounts of hundreds of volatile \ncompounds can be found in non toasted \noak wood [6]; meanwhile relative few \nvolatile compounds including vanillin, \neugenol, and cis-and trans-\u03b2-methyl-\u03b3-\noctalactones are present in significant \namounts [2,7,8]. Other volatile com-\npounds are formed by thermal \ndegradation of the main wood polymers \nduring the toasting process but also the \namounts of the compounds found in \nuntoasted oak wood increase by the \ntoasting step. Phenol and furan \naldehydes are the most abundant \naromatic compounds identified in \ntoasted wood; however, only vanillin \ncontributes actively to aroma. A \nnumber of other volatile phenols \nresponsible for the \u201cspicy\u201d and \n\u201csmoky\u201d characteristics of toasted \nwood [5] are formed during this step. \nExtracts obtained from toasted or \nnon toasted wood, containing different \namount of these wood compounds, \nhave been traditionally used for \nmodifying the colour and flavour of \nalcohol beverages. The composition of \nthese wood extracts is under European \nLegislation [9] and must be performed \nusing exclusively alcohol and water. \nExtracts of fragrance and flavour \nsubstances obtained from plants are \nknown as pomades, concentrates, \nabsolutes, resinoids, or tinctures, \naccording to the method used for \npreparation. Industrial manufacture of \nwood extracts is performed by treating \nnatural raw material with ethanol or \nwater-ethanol mixtures, thus obtaining \na tincture [10]. Comercial wood \nextracts are obtained by recirculating \nwater\/ethanol mixtures through a bed of \nchips at ambient temperature and \npressure for 4 to 7 hours, although the \nspecific details are considered a trade \nsecret. Solvent extraction is generally \napplied for the separation of ther-\nmolabile plant compounds.  \nThe use of water under certain \nconditions (subcritical water) for the \nextraction of essential oils from aro-\nmatic plants is a recent [11,12] and\nChromatographia,  2003, Vol. 57, 363-368  \n  \n 3\nvery promising field which has \npromoted the development of an \nalternative method different from the \nconventional method used so far for \nobtaining aromatic compounds from \nwood.  \n \nExperimental \n \nInstruments and Apparatus \nThe subcritical fluid extractions were \nperformed using the following assem-\nbly: a Knauer 64 high pressure pump \n(Knauer, Berlin, Germany), used to \npropel the extractant liquid through the \nsystem. The extractor, depicted in \nFigure 1, consisted of a stainless steel \ncylindrical extraction chamber (150 x11 \nmm i.d., 14 mL internal volume) which \nwas closed with screws at both ends in \norder to permit its filling with \nextractant and emptying of the extract. \nThe screw caps also contained stainless \nsteel filters plates (2 mm in thickness \nand 6,35 mm in i.d.) to ensure that the \nwood chips remained in the extraction \nchamber. This chamber, together with a \nstainless steel preheater, was located in \na gas chromatograph oven (HP 5720A, \nHewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE) \nused as heating source and designed to \nwork up to 400 \u00baC. A loop made from \n1-m length stainless-steel tubing, and \ncooled with water at room temperature, \nwas used to cool the extract from the \noven to a temperature close to 25 \u00baC. A \npressure needle valve coupled to the \noutlet of the cooler, and a selecting \nvalve located between the high-pressure \npump and the oven allows flush the \nextract with N2 after extraction. \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Extraction System. hpp: high \npressure pump, er: extractant reservoir, ph: \npre-heater, ec: extraction cell, o: oven, c: \ncooler, v1=selection valve, v2=restriction \nvalve.   \n \nAnalysis of the extracts were \nperformed using a Varian 3900 gas \nchromatograph equipped with a \nChrompack capillary CP-Wax 57 CB \nfused silica column (50 m x 0.25 mm \nid, 0.2 \u03bcm film thickness) and a flame \nionisation detector (FID). Finally, a Sa-\nturn 2200 mass spectrometer (Varian) \nequipped with a Chrompack capillary \nCP-Sil 8 CB fused silica column (50 m \nx 0.25 mm i.d.) was used to char-\nacterise the compounds. A Cary 50 \nConc spectrophotometer from Varian \n(Mulgrave, Australia), connected to a \ncomputer with Cary WinUV v.2.0\u00ae \n(Varian) software for data collection \nand treatment, was also used for total \npolyphenol index (t.p.i.) measurements \nof the extracts.  \nJ. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al                            \n \n \n 4 \nAll the extracts were centrifuged \nusing a Selecta (Barcelona, Spain) \nMixtasel centrifuge and filtered using \n0.45 \u03bcm Minisart filters from Sartorius \n(G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). Statistical treat-\nments were made using Statgraphics\u2122 \nplus 2.1. for Windows. \n \nReagents \nWood chips of American oak were \nobtained from a barrel shop in Montilla \n(C\u00f3rdoba, Spain). Ethanol 96% (v\/v) \nPA from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain) \nand distilled water were used for \npreparing the water-alcohol extraction \nmixtures used with ethanol contents \nfrom 0 to 60%. All gases were of 95% \npurity or higher (Air Liquide, Paris, \nFrance). \n \nProcedures \n \nSubcritical Extraction   \nThe sample cell in Figure 1 was filled \nwith 1.5 g of wood chips, and two \npieces of paper Albet 235 were inserted \nat both ends of the cell to prevent frit \nfrom clogging. After assembling the \nextraction cell in the oven, this was \nbrought up to the working temperature \n(200 \u00baC) and pressurised up to 40 atm \nwith a water-alcohol mixture, maintain-\ning closed valve v2. Once the system \nwas pressurised, valve v1 was closed, \nand a static extraction was developed \nfor 60 min. After this, v1 was switched \nto the open position to allow nitrogen to \nflow through the cell by opening valve \nv2. Then, the extract was collected in a \nvial at room temperature. \n \nChromatographic Separation and \nDetection \n For the optimisation study 2-\u03bcL \naliquots of extract were injected into \nthe chromatograph in the (1:15) split \nmode. The flow-rate of the carrier gas \n(helium) was 2.2 mL min-1; the injector \nand detector temperatures were pro-\ngrammed at 270 \u00baC; the oven tem-\nperature program was:  40 \u00baC (10 min), \n40 \u00baC to 200 \u00baC (15 \u00baC min-1), 200 \u00baC \n(90 min).  \nFor characterisation of the extract, \nan aliquot of 1 \u03bcL of extract was \ninjected in the chromatograph\/mass \nspectrometer in the 1:15 split mode. \nThe carrier gas (helium) flow-rate was \n1 mL min-1; injector and detector tem-\nperatures were programmed at 270 and \n300 \u00baC, respectively; the oven tempera-\nture program was: 40 \u00baC (10 min), 40 \n\u00baC to 200 \u00baC (15 \u00baC min-1), 200 \u00baC (20 \nmin), 200 \u00baC to 275\u00baC (10 \u00baC min-1). \n \nDetermination of the Total Polyphenol \nIndex (I280) \nThe extracts were diluted with water in \nan 1:100 ratio and the absorbance was \ndirectly monitored at 280 nm. The \nvalue of the I280 was calculated by \nmultiplying the absorbance x 100. \n \nResults and Discussion \n \nA static approach was tested for the \nextraction of compounds from wood in \norder to enhance the sample-extractant \ncontact, thus favouring the attainment \nof the partition equilibrium.  \nChromatographia,  2003, Vol. 57, 363-368  \n  \n 5\nOptimisation of Variables \nThe variables affecting subcritical ex-\ntraction were studied in order to \nmaximise the yield of compounds \nextracted from wood in a time as short \nas possible. With this aim, a multivari-\nate approach was used for optimising \nthe physical variables affecting the \nextraction, and a univariate approach \nwas used for studying influence of the \nethanol percent in the extraction \nmixture. The range over which the \nvariables were studied and the optimum \nvalues found are given in Table I. \nA multivariate approach was used \nfor the optimisation of the extraction \ntime and temperature within the ranges \n10-75 min and 80-300 \u00baC, respectively, \nusing the areas or eight of the peaks \nchosen from the GC-FID chromato-\ngrams as dependent variable. The \nresults from the ANOVA studies and \nthe response surfaces for the experi-\nmental design obtained were statisti-\ncally equal in all cases. \nThe signal increased when time and \ntemperature were increased but with a \nhigher effect from the former. A time of \n60 min and a temperature of 200 \u00baC \nwere selected as optimum. Tempera-\ntures higher than 200 \u00baC caused \ndegradation of a number of the com-\npounds characteristic of the wood ex-\ntracts, as shown in the GC-FID \nchromatogram in Figure 2. The extracts \nobtained at these temperatures (Figure \n2(b)) had a strong wood burning smell \ninstead of that typical of toasted wood. \nThe characteristic structure was lost in \nthe process. These reasons made that \nthese temperatures were rejected \ndespite some of the peaks selected for \nthe optimisation study increased. Since \nthe P-value in the ANOVA table is less \nthan 0.05%, there is a statistically \nsignificant relationship between the \nvariables at 95% confidence level. The \nequation of the model for the chosen \npeak is: Area=2727 \u2013 194.6 T + 251 t + \n1.5 T2 +2,3Tt \u2013 3.8 t2, where \nT=temperature and t=time.  \n \n \nTable I.

The pressure was that \nrequired to maintain liquid the ethanol-\nwater mixture. As the vapour pressure \nof ethanol and water at the optimum \ntemperature (200 \u00baC) are 30 and 20 atm, \nrespectively, [13], a pressure of 40 atm \nwas chosen in order to guarantee the \nliquid state of the extractant in all the \nexperiments. \n \nComposition of the Extract \nThe composition of the extract obtained \nusing the optimal working conditions \nwas characterised by gas chromato-\ngraphy-mass spectrometry in Total Ion \nCount (TIC) mode, that provided the \nchromatogram shown in Figure 3(a); \nwhich was compared with that in \nFigure 3(b), which corresponds to the \ncommercial product more similar to \nthat provided by the proposed method. \nApproximately 75% of the compounds \nfound in the commercial product are \npresent in the extract obtained by the \nproposed method, and 50% of the \ncompounds present in both are those \ntypically found in the literature as \ncharacteristic of extracts from oak \nwood.  \nAlthough more than 140 com-\npounds have been found in the extract \nfrom oak wood [14-17], only approxi-\nmately 25 can be considered typical of \nthis wood. The heterogeneity is quite \ncommon because the composition \ndepends on the storage, origin, specie, \nand seasoning of the oak wood used for \nthe study. Commercial extracts are \nwidely available but the specific nature \nof the wood, its preparation, and the \nextraction procedures used to obtain \nthem is considered a trade secret. Thus, \nthese commercial extracts can only be \nused for rough comparisons. \nAs can be observed in Figure 4, by \ncomparing the chromatogram obtained \nby GC-FID from the extract provided \nby the proposed method with those \nfrom commercial products used in the \nstudy, the former shows similar \ncomposition to the latter, then the \nextract provided by the proposed \nmethod is not inconsistent with the \ncommercial products. The same conclu-\nsion is obtained through the total poly-\nphenol index (t.p.i.) as a measurement \nof the polyphenol content of the extract. \nFigure 5 shows the t.p.i. obtained for \nthe six commercial extracts analysed \nand the t.p.i. of the subcritical extracts \nobtained by using different ethanol-\nwater mixtures, compared with the \naverage value obtained for the com-\nmercial products (represented by the \ndotted line). The t.p.i. value increases \nwith growing concentrations of ethanol \nin the extractant. Thus, for a concen-\ntration of 20% (v\/v) ethanol, the t.p.i. of \nthe subcritical extract is higher than that \nobtained from the commercial average \nwith an ethanol content of 50% (v\/v), \napproximately. \n \nExhaustive Extraction \nA study of exhaustive extraction of the \nvaluable compounds in the wood \nsample was performed.

These changes are \nunfeasible with the conventional methods \n[10]. \n \nConclusion \n \nAs far as possible, the extracts obtained \nby use of subcritical water-ethanol mix-\ntures were compared with commercial \nextracts due to the impossibility of \nobtaining in the laboratory extracts \nsimilar to those commercial. The policy \nof the industry hinders it to provide the \nauthors with the detailed procedure. Only \nthe final, concentrated extract obtained in \nthe industry was supplied to the authors. \nThe extraction of wood compounds \nby use of subcritical ethanol-water \nmixtures presents a number of advantages \nas compared with conventional alter-\nnatives used in the industry, namely: \nshorter extraction times (60 min versus 4-\n7 hours required by Industrial methods); \nimportant saving of ethanol (extracts with \nonly 20% ethanol surpasses the poly-\nphenol content of commercial extracts); \nthe obtained extracts are not inconsistent \nwith the commercial ones; and the \npossibility of manipulating the com-\nposition by changing the extraction \nparameters (which allows the obtainment \nof extracts with different composition). \nThe comparison of the GC-MS chromato-\ngrams from the extract and the com-\nmercial products shows that there is a \n75% coincidence between the compounds \nfound in both.  \nChromatographia,  2003, Vol. 57, 363-368  \n  \n 11\nAcknowledgments \nThe Spanish Comisi\u00f3n Interministerial \nde Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CICyT) is \nthanked for financial support (Project \nAGL2000-0321-P4-03).  \n \nBibliography \n \n(1) Marsal, F.; Sarre, C.
