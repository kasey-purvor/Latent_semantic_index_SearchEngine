Feminist theory, for example, has long been occupied with the \nrelations between women\u201fs bodies and mirror images (de Beauvoir 1949), and images in \nart (Betterton 1987, 1996; Pollock 1987), photography (Kuhn 1995; Lury 1998), film \n(Doane 1992; Mulvey 1989; Stacey 1994), and magazines\n \n(McRobbie 1999). Recently, \nmuch feminist empirical work has focused on the relations between girls\u201f and young \nwomen\u201fs bodies and images in \u201cthe media\u201d1. This article considers some of this research, \nand its limitations, through an exploration of my own research with a small number of \nwhite teenage British girls. My aim in this article is to open up the possible ways in \nwhich the relations between girls\u201f bodies and images might be conceived. In particular, I \nargue that existing feminist empirical and theoretical work is underpinned, usually \nimplicitly and to greater and lesser extents, by an oppositional model of body\/image, \nsubject\/object. In contrast, by developing Deleuze\u201fs concepts of becoming through my \nresearch, I propose an alternative model grounded not in oppositions but in process, \nrelationality and transformation. Such a model understands bodies and images not as \nseparate and separable entities (subjects and objects for example) between which \nrelations operate, but as constituted through their relationality. I consider the ways in \nwhich bodies are known, understood and experienced through images, that is, the ways in \nwhich bodies become through their relations with images.  \n \n 3 \nMy argument here is four-fold. First, in discussing some of the existing empirical \nresearch on the relations between girls\u201f bodies and images, my concern is to explicate the \nbinary opposition of subject\/object. Second, I examine how the body\/image, \nsubject\/object model often relies on and reinforces a relation of media effect. This \u201cmedia \neffects\u201d model has been critiqued for its inability to measure \u201ceffect\u201d in any meaningful \nway (for example Gauntlett 2005) but I suggest that it also simplifies the complex \nrelations between bodies and images. Third, in drawing attention to these complex \nrelations, I argue that to separate bodies and images into a binary opposition of \nsubject\/object is unhelpful because, as feminist theoretical work on the relations between \nwomen\u201fs bodies and images has suggested, women\u201fs bodies are often both subjects and \nobjects of images and do not exist as an entity that is secure and bounded from images. \nFourth, and as indicated above perhaps most fundamentally, my argument aims to \ndemonstrate how, in working with a dichotomy of subject\/object, much feminist work \nobscures the ways in which bodies become through their relations with images. If this \npoint is taken seriously, the questions for feminist empirical and theoretical research must \nshift. In terms of the argument that I have sketched so far, feminist research must shift \nfrom understanding bodies and images as subjects and objects which exist prior to their \nrelationality. Consequently, feminist research should attend not (only) to how images \neffect bodies, that is to how pre-existent bodies are effected by pre-existent images. \nRather, if relations with images constitute bodies, a focus of feminist research should be \non how bodies are experienced through images and on how these experiences limit or \nextend the becoming of bodies.  \n \n 4 \nFeminist empirical research \nFeminist empirical work on the relations between girls\u201f and women\u201fs bodies and \nimages is wide-ranging, trans-disciplinary and concerned with images in different \ncontexts. For example, research focuses on beauty industries (Black 2004, Craig 2006), \n\u201chealth\u201d and dieting industries (Nichter 2000), magazines (Duke 2000), and mass media \nimages (Grogan and Wainwright 1996, Grogan et al 1996, Durham 1999, Goodman \n2002, Goodman and Walsh-Childers 2004). A central theme of much feminist empirical \nresearch is on the increasing homogenisation of Western cultural images of female bodies \n(as young, white, thin, attractive, healthy, heterosexual, middle-class for example), and \nwith how women feel about and respond to such images. Specific issues that feminist \nempirical work has attended to include the pressure women feel from images results in an \nincrease of young women developing eating disorders and\/or \u201cbody-hatred\u201d (Frost 2001), \nthe negotiation of women\u201fs \u201cself-image\u201d with the \u201cbody work\u201d of dieting and exercise, \ncosmetic surgery and appearance (Gimlin 2002) and the resistance of popular media \nimages by the construction of \u201calternative femininities\u201d through appearance, body \nmodification and clothing (Holland 2004).\n2\n   While it is difficult, if not impossible, to \nsummarise such a diverse field, my concern here is with the ways in which this work \ntends to map bodies and images onto a prior distinction between subjects and objects.   \nTo demonstrate my point in more detail, the focus of the discussion in this section \nis two research projects which examine different aspects of the relations between girls\u201f \nbodies and media images: Grogan and Wainwright\u201fs (1996) study of girls\u201f experiences of \nbody dissatisfaction and Duke\u201fs (2000) study of the role of culture in girls\u201f interpretations \nof the feminine ideal in teen magazines. These research studies are discussed because \n 5 \nthey are indicative of the questions and conclusions of much feminist empirical research, \nand because of the number of methodological features they have in common with each \nother and with my research\n3\n. I am interested here in the conceptual framework underlying \nthese studies and the kinds of assumptions and arguments about the relations between \nbodies and images such a framework makes possible. \n \nGrogan and Wainwright (1996) argue that girls as young as eight recognise and \ninternalise dominant cultural pressures to be thin. Their article is part of a wider \npsychological study of young women\u201fs body image and body (dis)satisfaction based on \ngroup interviews with white working and middle-class girls aged 8 and 13 from the UK.  \nSome of the questions asked in these group interviews specifically concerned models in \nmagazines and media role models (1996, p. 668) and the girls raised issues of weight and \nbody shape, exercise (and body building in particular) and food as particularly worrying \nand discussed their dissatisfaction with their own bodies.  For Grogan and Wainwright, \nthis is evidence that \u201cgirls of these ages have already internalised adult\u201fs ideals of \nslimness\u201d (1996, p. 668) and, further, that \u201cwomen from primary-school age onwards are \nsensitive to cultural pressures to conform to a limited range of acceptable body shapes\u201d \n(1996, p. 672). In identifying girl and teen magazines in particular, and drawing on \nfeminist research in this area, Grogan and Wainwright argue that images in such \nmagazines: \n \nHave powerful effects on their readers, serving to foster and maintain a \u201ccult of \nfemininity\u201d, supplying definitions of what it means to be a woman. It is a matter \n 6 \nof concern that the images presented in teen magazines present such a restricted \nrange of models for young women. If women\u201fs body image can be bolstered by \nalternative sources of information, they may be more resilient against influences \nsuch as teen magazines, because young women who grow up with a positive body \nimage are less likely to be affected by cultural messages. (Grogan and Wainwright \n1996, p. 672, references omitted). \n \nFor Grogan and Wainwright here, girls\u201f bodies need to be \u201cmore resilient against \ninfluences such as teenage magazines\u201d in order to be \u201cless likely to be affected by \ncultural messages\u201d. They suggest that \u201calternative sources of information\u201d are one way of \n\u201cbolster[ing]\u201d \u201cwomen\u201fs body image\u201d because they would feature a less \u201crestricted range \nof models for young women\u201d and would thus \u201csupply\u201d a greater range of feminine ideals. \nGrogan and Wainwright\u201fs argument here clearly relies on a separation of bodies and \nimages and a mapping of these distinct entities onto a dichotomy of subjects and objects. \nMoreover, what this separation of bodies\/subjects and images\/objects produces is a \nrelatively straightforward and linear relationship of media effects; young women\u201fs bodies \nare vulnerable to the \u201cpowerful effects\u201d of magazine images.  \n \nLeaving aside the difficulty of how such media effects can be measured, from the \nperspective of media and cultural studies Grogan and Wainwright\u201fs psychological \nposition is problematic in its silence around questions of \u201creadership\u201d and \n\u201cinterpretation\u201d. What does it mean for an 8 year old and a 13 year old white working or \nmiddle class girl to read a magazine? Do they interpret the same material differently? Are \n 7 \ntheir levels of \u201ceffectability\u201d from cultural messages different? Questions such as these \nderived from cultural studies of audiences and feminist research on gender, race and \nadolescence occupy a central place in Lisa Duke\u201fs (2000) research on girls\u201f \ninterpretations of the feminine ideal in teen magazines. Duke\u201fs research questions \nspecifically address why and how girls read magazines (are magazines satisfying the \ngirls\u201f needs and desires? Do they read fashion and beauty critically?) and the role of race \nin \u201cinfluenc[ing] the way these middle-class girls interpret teen magazines\u201f images and \ntext\u201d (2000 p. 374). Duke\u201fs article is based on a wider longitudinal study which traces \ngirls\u201f interpretations of magazines from early to late adolescence (2000, p. 375). Three \ngroups of middle-class girls participated in the research. The first group comprised of ten \nwhite girls interviewed aged 12-14 and again aged 16-18 and the second and third groups \ncomprised of sixteen African-American girls, eight of whom were aged 12-14 and eight \nof whom were aged 17-18 (2000, p. 375).  \n \nDuke\u201fs starting point is that \u201c[m]edia have been implicated in establishing \natypical standards of appearance as the social norm and encouraging girls\u201f preoccupation \nwith their looks\u201d (2000, p. 369). Adolescent girls, because they \u201cexperience significant \nphysical and developmental change\u201d are especially vulnerable to the media, and \u201cmedia \nlike teen magazines serve as guidebooks on acceptable appearance, gender roles, and \nrelationship formation [\u2026], replacing parents and augmenting or surpassing peers as \nprimary information sources\u201d (Duke 2000, p. 369). In Duke\u201fs interviews, both black and \nwhite girls discuss how magazine images are unachievable but nevertheless powerful in \n 8 \ntheir ability to \u201cput a picture in your head\u201d (2000, p. 377). However, Duke\u201fs study \nindicates that: \n \nMost African-American girls [\u2026] were uninterested in striving for or achieving \nthe ideal feminine physique, as the magazines portray it. Similarly, there was little \ninterest in makeup and grooming advice that was seen as inappropriate for Black \ngirls, due either to formulations intended for White girls, or African-American \ngirls\u201f belief that cosmetics were superfluous to being attractive. (2000, p. 382) \n \nFor Duke, whereas the white girls in her study evaluated and defined themselves by their \nappearance, the African-American girls deemed personality and character more \nsignificant (2000, p. 382).  Duke argues that the feminine ideal of beauty and slimness is \nless important to African-American girls, partly because of the exclusion of images of \nblack girls and women in magazines and partly because of African-American culture \nwhich has a  \n \nmore realistic, inclusive view of the female physical norm [\u2026] reinforced by elder \nfemale family members, who were said to view heavier girls as healthier, and by \nAfrican-American men, who prize \u201cthick\u201d or amply filled out girls as sexually \nappealing and desirable. (2000, p. 385) \n \nDuke argues here that the African-American cultural valuation and appreciation of a \n\u201cmore realistic, inclusive [\u2026] female physical norm\u201d, are directs African-American girls\u201f \n 9 \ninterest away from \u201cstriving for or achieving the ideal feminine physique\u201d depicted in \nteen magazines. However, although her argument focuses on how African-American girls \nare not as \u201ceffectable\u201d as white girls and therefore attends to more complex questions of \nreadership and interpretation than the psychological study, there remains a reliance on a \nmodel of media effects and on a separation of bodies and images into bounded and \ndifferent subjects and objects. Indeed, in some ways, Duke\u201fs argument is similar to \nGrogan and Wainwright\u201fs in that \u201calternative\u201d \u201ccultural messages\u201d will \u201ceffect\u201d bodies in \na more positive way.  \n \nFeminist theory \nFeminist theoretical work on the relations between women\u201fs bodies and film, art \nand photographic images has complicated and disrupted any clear distinction between \nsubjects and objects by arguing that such a distinction is inherently masculine. In her \nexploration of the ways in which photographs create specific ways of seeing, knowing \nand living, Celia Lury argues that subjectivity has been defined through its difference to \nobjectivity; subjects are conscious, have a continuity of memory and an ability to \nauthorise such a continuity and have a recognisable, that is unique, body (1998, pp. 7-12). \nSuch a notion of subjectivity is inherently white, masculine and class-privileged, for it \ndepends upon qualities such as rationality, autonomy and control which are not and have \nnot been equally available. Rosemary Betterton (1987) focuses on the spectatorship of art \nto demonstrate that the dichotomy between \u201cthe subject who looks\u201d and \u201cthe object \nlooked at\u201d collapses if considered from the position of women. As part of a visual culture \ncharacterised by the pervasiveness of images of the female body, Betterton argues that \nwomen are everywhere constituted as objects, that is are always, potentially, both subject \n 10 \nand object. The spatial and temporal gap between subject\/body and object\/image does not \nexist for women. This point is also made by feminist scholars of film. Laura Mulvey\u201fs \n(1989) classic \u201ccinepsychoanalytic\u201d perspective, for example, critiques conventional \nunderstandings of cinematic pleasure by demonstrating how they operate through a \nnotion of male desire where the male subject is the viewer who looks at images of \nfemales. Similarly, Mary Ann Doane (1992) contrasts masculine and feminine modes of \nlooking and, drawing on Freud\u201fs distinction between seeing and knowing, argues that, \nwhile for masculine subjects there is a gap between what he looks at and what he knows, \nfor feminine subjects this distance or gap is \u201cnegate[d]\u201d: \u201cFor the female spectator there \nis a certain over-presence of the image \u2013 she is the image\u201d (1992, p. 231).  \n \nThe problem of the \u201cover-presence\u201d of the image is explored by feminist theorists \nsuch as Susan Bordo (2003). For Bordo there is a clear link between contemporary \nWestern visual culture and the burden of weight for Western women. Bordo\u201fs concern is \nthe way in which perfected bodies become normalised through the sheer number of \nimages and their rapid and pervasive circulation: \n \nThese images are teaching us how to see. Filtered, smoothed, polished, softened, \nre-arranged. And passing. Digital creations, visual cyborgs, teaching us what to \nexpect from flesh and blood. Training our perception in what\u201fs a defect and what \nis normal (2003, p. xviii) \n \n 11 \nLike the other feminist theorists discussed above, Bordo frames her argument in terms of \nseeing and spectatorship. Drawing attention to the ubiquity, or \u201cover-presence\u201d, of \nimages of particular kinds of female bodies, Bordo argues that perceptions of \u201creal\u201d \nbodies shift to expect \u201c[f]iltered, smoothed, polished, softened, re-arranged\u201d bodies. In \nthis sense, Bordo blurs the boundaries between bodies and images by highlighting the \nlack of a spatial and temporal gap between them; bodies are \u201ccreations\u201d, \u201chybrids\u201d of \nimages. However, despite this, Bordo\u201fs argument rests upon a model of subject\/object. \nHer argument operates through a (Foucauldian) notion of subjectivity where the women \nwho look at images are subjects who look at objects. As such, the subject\/object \ndistinction is confused but not dislodged. This point is also relevant to the work of the \nfeminist theorists discussed above; while the subject\/object dichotomy is blurred the \nmodel itself remains. In the rest of this article, I want to displace the subject\/object model \nand instead conceive the relations between bodies and images through becoming.  \n \nBecoming \nThe basis of my empirical research was to understand bodies as becomings and to \nexplore the ways in which bodies become through images. In this section I outline what is \nmeant by \u201cbecoming\u201d and suggest some of the shifts involved in taking up this concept. \nFor Deleuze, becoming refers to process, inter-connectivity and relationality.\n4\n  Becoming \nis a means to \u201cget outside the dualisms\u201d that have conventionally governed Western \nthought and instead to \u201cbe-between, to pass between [\u2026] never ceasing to become\u201d \n(Deleuze and Guattari 1987, p. 277). Becoming in this sense explains the world not as \nrelatively stable and discrete forms or beings (subjects\/objects, bodies\/images) but as \n 12 \nprocesses of movement, variation and multiplicity. Becomings are transformations \u2013 not \nof forms transforming into another or different form but of constantly processual, \nconstantly transforming relations. A first consequence to note in Deleuze\u201fs shift from a \nphilosophy of being to becoming is that subjects and objects become replaced with \nbodies. In a Deleuzian sense, bodies refer not necessarily to human bodies but to a \nmultiple and diverse series of connections which assemble as a particular spatial and \ntemporal moment (Deleuze and Guattari 1987). Multiplicity and difference are key to \nDeleuze\u201fs concept of becoming and it is through the connections between multiple and \ndifferent things that bodies must be understood. For example, a Deleuzian account would \nunderstand bodies not as a bounded subject that is separate from images but rather would \nsee the connections between humans and images as constituting a body. Models which \nmap fluid and dynamic becomings on to static and closed systems of being risk ignoring \nthe ways in which bodies are constituted and, crucially, could be constituted differently. \nIt seems imperative that a feminist account of the relations between bodies and images is \nable to account for how bodies might become differently. \n \nIn highlighting how a body becomes through its inter-connections with multiple \nand diverse things, Deleuze is arguing that a body is a relational becoming, is \u201cnever \nseparable from its relations with the world\u201d (Deleuze 1992, p. 628). Bodies are processes \nwhich become through their relations and, as such, there are not relations between pre-\nexistent entities (bodies and images, subjects and objects) but rather entities are \nconstituted through their relations (Fraser et al 2005, p. 3). A body is not a human subject \nwho has relations with images, then, but rather a body is the relation between what \n 13 \nconventional philosophy has called a human subject and images. A second shift \nintroduced by a Deleuzian perspective on the relations between bodies and images is that \nit is the relations, rather than the bodies and images themselves, that are brought into \nfocus. A Deleuzian account of bodies must attend to how that body becomes through its \nrelations. This would suggest that what is at stake in such research is the ways in which \nrelations constitute bodies and images and the ways in which it is through relations that \nbodies and images become. This might mean that instead of focusing on what are \u201cgood\u201d \nand \u201cbad\u201d images, or what are dissatisfying or unhealthy bodies, research would focus on \nwhat the relations between bodies and images limit or extend. For example, what \nknowledges, understandings and experiences of bodies are produced through images? \nHow do relations constitute particular kinds of bodies and images? \n \nShifting to examine relations as extending and limiting particular becomings of \nbodies raises a third implication for feminist research on bodies and images. Deleuze \nargues that relations create certain affects: \u201ca body affects other bodies, and is affected by \nother bodies\u201d (1992, p. 625). According to this Deleuzian perspective, it is not that \nimages have negative effects on the vulnerable bodies of girls as there are no clear lines \nof division between them. Instead, the relations between bodies and images produce \nparticular affects, some of which \u2013 like \u201cfeeling bad\u201d \u2013 might be limiting to the becoming \nof bodies. This is, I would suggest, a radically different understanding of the relations \nbetween bodies and images from the model of \u201cmedia effects\u201d, not only because of how \nbodies and images are understood as in constitutive relations but also because, as I will \nargue, studying affective relations raises new questions for feminist research.  \n 14 \n \nThe becoming of bodies through images \nMethod \nMy empirical research project explored the relations between a small number of \ngirls\u201f bodies and images and argued that bodies become through their relations with \nimages. Thirteen 13 and 14 year old white girls participated in the research. They came \nfrom two schools, one in south east London and one in Oxfordshire. My contacts in both \nschools (a white male teacher in one and a white female counsellor in the other) secured \nconsent from their schools for the research to take place, explained the research to one \nyear group class in each school and asked for volunteers to participate. The girls were \ntherefore self-selecting due to their interest in the area, rather than being selected \naccording to specific criteria. As they were in the same class, the girls knew each other, \nbut had different levels of friendship. My contact with the girls occurred in their schools \nwithin the usual school day and took place over the summer term of 2003. The research \nconsisted of an initial group meeting with the girls and a series of three recorded \ninterviews.   \n \nIn the initial meeting I introduced the research project to the girls and gained \nconsent both from them and from a parent\/guardian. The first interview was a semi-\nstructured focus group in which the girls discussed their relations with images in a \ngeneral sense. I began the focus group by asking the girls to talk about their bodies in \ntheir own domestic photographs which they had brought with them. This served to \nstimulate the conversation, and proved useful in asking the girls about other images of \n 15 \ntheir bodies that might be important to them. The second interview was an individual \ninterview with each of the girls\n5\n in which I asked them to follow up, expand on or correct, \nissues which had been discussed in the focus group interview. I also asked the girls \nspecifically about how they imagined their bodies in the future, and about the relations \nbetween these future bodies and images of their present and past bodies. The third \ninterview was an image-making session in which the girls created images of their bodies \nusing an \u201carchive\u201d of magazine images, a Polaroid camera, make-up, food wrappers, craft \nmaterials, scissors, papers, pens and glues. This interview was designed to make images \nnot only the subject of the research but also part of it. The interview data discussed below \nis taken from the first and second interviews. \n     \nIn the sections above, I have indicated the way in which I understood \u201cbody\u201d in \nthe research through a Deleuzian framework. It is worth noting that \u201cimage\u201d was also \nconceived in an open sense; my focus was not specifically on \u201cmedia images\u201d but was \nconcerned with the images that were significant to the girls who participated. As \ndemonstrated at the beginning of this article, opening questions in the research included, \n\u201cwhat does image mean to you?\u201d, \u201cwhat images are most important to how you \nexperience your body?\u201d, \u201chow do you experience your body through images?\u201d While \nimages in popular media were an important image through which knowledges, \nunderstandings and experiences of their bodies were produced, the girls also discussed \nother kinds of images, for example mirror images, photographic images, glimpses in shop \nor car windows, images produced through comments from boys, from friends and from \nparents. In discussing these different kinds of images, my research attempted to attend to \n 16 \nthe relations that images are involved in and the ways in which experiences produced \nthrough one kind of image might complement or contradict experiences produced through \nother kinds of images. In the section below I discuss how experiences of bodies produced \nthrough images from teenage magazines and popular culture are understood through \nexperiences of bodies produced through the girls\u201f relations with their own photographs. \nAs outlined above, my focus here is not on the effects of photographic and popular \ncultural images on bodies, but on the ways in which the girls\u201f bodies can be understood \nas becoming through their relations with these specific kinds of image.  \n \nPhotographic images \nRC:  ok, so if a photo makes you feel bad, why does it make you feel bad? \nTa:  cos you don\u201ft like the way you look \n[\u2026] \nS:  because you just look bad, and it makes you think \u201cis that, is that what I \nactually look like?\u201d \n[\u2026]  \nA:  yeah, \u201cis that what I actually look like?\u201d \n[\u2026] \nRC:  so that\u201fs why you don\u201ft like them?  Because you think that that\u201fs what you \nactually look like? \nF:  yeah, because it\u201fs gonna show you how you actually look \n \n 17 \nIn this extract from one of the focus group interviews, Tasha, Sammy, Anna and \nFay discuss how their own photographs show them as they \u201cactually look\u201d. Photographs \nmake them, in my words, \u201cfeel bad\u201d about their bodies because photographs show a body \nthat \u201cjust look[s] bad, and it makes you think, \u201eis that what I actually look like?\u201f\u201d Such an \nunderstanding of the relations between their bodies and their own photographs suggests \nthat for the girls here, the body of the photograph is only one way in which they know, \nunderstand and experience their bodies; there are other, diverse and multiple, bodies \nwhich are not experienced as they \u201cactually look\u201d in photographs. Photographic images, \nthen, are a specific kind of image which produce particular knowledges, understandings \nand experiences of their bodies. In this section, I want to explore the experiences of \nbodies that photographs produce and examine how these experiences can be understood \nthrough movement and transformation, that is through a logic of becoming.   \n \nThe notion of \u201cactuality\u201d which the girls point to above was closely linked to their \nunderstanding of a photograph as \u201ccapturing\u201d a body as a specific spatial and temporal \nmoment. Photographs captured a body, as it actually looked, as a moment in \u201cthe past\u201d \nand through this capture knowledges of that body both in the past and in the present and \nfuture were produced. For example, in the following extract Emily, Dionne, Sammy, Fay, \nKatie and Anna discuss how their knowledges and understandings of the body captured in \na photograph are multiple and changing: \n \n 18 \nE:  yeah, well, I\u201fve got quite a few pictures of where I was a bit younger \nwhere I thought I looked really nice but I actually didn\u201ft, I looked a lot \nbigger than what I actually was and that put me down quite a lot \nRC:  so in relation to kind of how you think about and feel about your body, \nhow are photos part of that? Or are photos part of that? \nD: well, yeah, cos if you take a really bad picture you\u201fre like, you hide it, \ndon\u201ft you? Cos like \nS:  cos you don\u201ft want other people to see it \nF:  yeah to see what you actually look like \nK:  but it\u201fs funny then when you look back and like it\u201fs only even a year ago \nand you think \u201cGod I was really fat then\u201d or something and I\u201fve really \nchanged a lot \nF:  yeah I\u201fve got this picture of me playing badminton and I was like, \u201clook at \nmy belly!\u201d And you just think, oh, I don\u201ft know \nD:  what was it, a centimetre? Don\u201ft worry \nA:  or you think you like that clothes and then you look back in a photo and \nyeah \nK: oh, I don\u201ft like that now \nF:  yeah pink and purple and stuff and it\u201fs just nasty \n \nWhat emerges in this extract is that the capturing of a body in a photograph does not \nreduce or limit the knowledges of that body to that photograph. Instead, the body that is \ncaptured within a photographic image can itself be understood differently; \u201cI thought I \n 19 \nlooked really nice but actually I didn\u201ft\u201d, \u201cyou look back [\u2026] and I\u201fve really changed a \nlot\u201d, \u201cI don\u201ft like that now\u201d. The \u201cpast\u201d body, then, is not static or contained within the \nphotograph but, on the contrary, is constantly transforming; is (capable of) constantly \nbeing known, understood and experienced differently.\n6\n The \u201ccapturing\u201d of a body in a \nphotograph in this sense refers not to the depiction of a body in its entirety but to how a \nphotograph produces particular knowledges, understandings and experiences of a body, \nfor example as showing a body as it \u201cactually\u201d looks. \n \nIndeed, Tina explicitly discusses the inability of a photograph to capture a body in \nits entirety: \n \nTi:  yeah cos like in a picture you capture like [\u2026], say I did something with \nmy lips or something, like pushed them right out, it would make me look \nworse so people might think I look like that whereas normally if I just do \nthat then I can put it back and you can see it\u201fs just like that \nSome of the girls also discussed how photographs, in showing them what they \u201cactually\u201d \nlook like, are deliberately made to show only a partial image of their body.  This seemed \nespecially the case when the girls discussed what makes a \u201cnice\u201d photograph: \n \nRC:  so what makes a nice photo then? \nE:  just when you\u201fre looking nice \nF:  and when you look natural and you don\u201ft look like you\u201fre posing \nS: yeah yeah \n 20 \nD: I can\u201ft, I can\u201ft be natural, I always pose \nS: like when us two, like when your dad took a photo of us two \nF:  yeah, \nS: kind of nice but natural as well weren\u201ft we? \nF: yeah, we did her hair all nice so she was like really pleased with that \nRC:  so like, you\u201fve made an effort but you look, you don\u201ft look posed \nF: no, no you don\u201ft look false, it\u201fs just kind of snapshots of you all through \nyour life \n \nLooking \u201cnice\u201d in a photograph, according to the girls here, is achieved through looking \n\u201cnatural\u201d, where natural refers to the presentation of the body as not \u201cposed\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d.  \nLooking nice through looking natural is, in the terms I have described above, the \ncapturing of a partial image of a body where the body not looking nice is obscured or \nerased. In drawing attention to the ways in which a body escapes its capture in the girls\u201f \nown photographic images, that is to the way in which a body always exists elsewhere and \n\u201celsewhen\u201d to a photographic image, I am suggesting that bodies and images cannot be \neasily or clearly bounded into separate entities, into subjects and objects. Instead, what \nseems to be significant in the ways in which the girls explain the relations between their \nbodies and their own photographs are notions of movement, change and transformation. I \nwould suggest that to account for these notions, a model of subject\/object should be \ndisplaced and instead a logic of becoming taken seriously. Such a logic attends to the \nmultiplicity of the ways in which bodies are known, understood and experienced through \ntheir relations with images and, moreover, would take this multiplicity and diversity to be \n 21 \ncharacteristic of the relations between bodies and images. Bodies exist not separately to \n(photographic) images but rather become through these images; knowledges, \nunderstandings and experiences of bodies are not \u201ceffected\u201d by images but are produced \nthrough, or become through, these images. \n \nPopular media images \nI argued above, that the girls\u201f photographs capture their bodies as different \ntemporal and spatial moments, and can therefore, in Fay\u201fs words, function as \u201csnapshots \nof you all through your life\u201d which provide knowledges of the change and movement of \nthat body. In this section, I want to suggest that the relations between bodies and images \nof women\u201fs and girl\u201fs bodies in popular media forms such as magazines, television and \ncelebrity culture more generally can also be understood through the concept of becoming. \nAgain, I want to draw attention to how bodies exceed their \u201ccapture\u201d within a specific \nimage and exist as knowledges, understandings and experiences elsewhere and \n\u201celsewhen\u201d.   \n \nThe notion of capture which was important to the girls\u201f understandings of their \nphotographs was also important to the way in which they discussed the bodies of \u201cmedia \nimages\u201d. While the girls talked about how they often felt bad about their own bodies in \nrelation to the bodies of media images, I would suggest that this can be conceived not as \nan \u201ceffect\u201d of media images but as a concern with how the becoming of bodies is limited \nor extended in particular ways. Consider, for example, the following extract in which \nChloe discusses her relations with magazine images: \n 22 \n \nRC: so how important are like media images and things like that to you? \nC:  erm, I think they are quite important cos when you\u201fre looking through \nmagazines and stuff you\u201fre like, \u201cwell, I wanna look like that\u201d and stuff \nbut I can\u201ft cos of the things they might put themselves through in order to \nlook like it so they are important when you\u201fre looking through magazines \nwill like bare, like, tans and make-up and stuff and when you look in the \nmagazine and you think \u201cthat looks nice\u201d and you try and do it yourself \nand it never goes right but it is quite important, it\u201fs depressing in a way \nRC:  why? \nC:  cos like the things that run through your head when you\u201fre looking at them \nand you\u201fre like \u201cI wanna look like that\u201d, \u201cI wanna be her\u201d and then you \nlook at them and you just sit there and think \u201cwell I can\u201ft\u201d so it\u201fs just like \ndepressing \n \nA feminist model of media effects might argue that the kinds of images of women\u201fs \nbodies that are published in magazines make Chloe feel depressed because, as she puts is, \nshe can\u201ft look like they do. Magazines, and the media and fashion industries more \ngenerally, only show \u201cimpossible images\u201d of women\u201fs bodies and this causes women, \nand young women in particular, to feel depressed about their own bodies and to have a \nbad body image. However, to return to the notion of capture discussed above, Chloe also \npoints to the way in which the body of a media image is itself a body that has been \ncaptured as a specific spatial and temporal moment and that therefore also exists \n 23 \nelsewhere and \u201celsewhen\u201d to this image: \u201call the things that they might have put \nthemselves through in order to look like it\u201d are air-brushed out of a media image but \ncannot be completely erased.   \n \nSome of the girls openly discussed the techniques and technologies that went into \nthe capturing of a body in a media image: \n \nT:  yeah but everyone always says \u201cyeah I\u201fd like to look like that person in a \nmagazine\u201d but they\u201fve been made up, and must have so much make-up \nand stuff on to look \nF:  yeah and photos, you can have them all airbrushed so they can look \nTa:  yeah, cos if they were us, if they had just a little bit of make-up on like  \nwe do then, they\u201fd look so different \nF:  yeah when I look at them and I try when I look at them to think \u201coh they  \nmust have their insecurities like everyone else\u201d and you think they\u201fre this \nperfect image because everyone loves them don\u201ft you and you think \u201cI \nwanna be like them\u201d but they must have their own insecurities as well \n \nAccording to Tasha and Fay here, make-up and air-brushing are typically part of the \nprocess of being captured for a magazine image. However, being aware of what goes into \nthe production of bodies in media images does not in itself dispel feeling bad. One way to \nconsider the \u201cfeeling bad\u201d is through how the girls discuss not liking their bodies in their \nown photographs, and the kinds of techniques they are involved in to try to look better, \n 24 \nfor example looking nice through looking natural. Just as the girls are aware that they can \ndo things to try to make their bodies \u201cactually\u201d look nice in their own photographs, they \nare aware that the bodies of media images are also \u201cput through\u201d things to look nice. In \nthis sense, then, the bodies of their own photographs and the bodies of media images are \nunderstood in similar ways, that is the bodies of media images are not understood as \n\u201cimpossible\u201d in and of themselves. Rather, the bodies of media images are also \nunderstood as diverse and multiple, as being caught as a specific spatial and temporal \nmoment and therefore as not reducible to that image. As such, the bodies captured in \nmedia images are not fundamentally different to the bodies of the girls that are captured \nin their own photographs: \n \nD:  what makes me feel better is like when you look in magazines at like the \nrough pages where the photographers have just caught them when they\u201fve \nlike just walked out of the house to get some bread from the corner shop \nF:  and you\u201fre like \u201cha ha ha ha\u201d \nD:  yeah \nRC:  so does that make you feel better then? \nF:  yeah, but in a really bitchy way it makes you feel, \n[laughter]  \n[\u2026] \nRC:  so why do those type of things make you feel better? \nTa:  cos it makes you think they\u201fre just the same as us cos but they\u201fre made  \nup and when they\u201fre in magazines and stuff its not their true face \n 25 \nF:  and they have bad hair days too and they don\u201ft look very good, cos all you  \ngenerally see are good pictures of them whereas of yourself you see good \nand bad pictures, so when you see them not looking good \n \nIn arguing that the bodies of their own photographs and the bodies of media \nimages are irreducible to the specific images that they are captured as, I am not \nsuggesting that the possibilities of becoming through relations with photographs and \nmedia images are the equivalent. That is, I am not arguing that the girls\u201f bodies become \nin the same way through their relations with photographs and media images. However, \nneither am I suggesting that the different possibilities of becoming are because the girls\u201f \nown photographs involve the capture of their own body, and that media images involve \nthe capture of another woman\u201fs body. As the extract above indicates, the bodies of media \nimages are \u201cjust the same as us\u201d. What a feminist account of the becoming of bodies \nthrough images needs to address, then, is the specificities of becomings: what extensions \nand limitations of becoming are produced through particular relations between bodies and \nimages? \n \nThe potentialities of becoming \nIt is clear, I hope, that a focus on becoming does not ignore the way in which \nrelations between bodies and images may not be satisfying or acceptable from a feminist \nperspective. To argue that bodies become through their relations with images, rather than \nbeing effected by images, is not to overlook the ways in which the girls, in both my \nresearch and in feminist empirical research more widely, describe feeling bad or \n 26 \ndepressed.\n7\n Rather, an ontology of becoming avoids conceiving \u201cfeeling bad\u201d as an effect \nof images and does not inscribe bodies and images onto a pre-existing distinction \nbetween subjects and objects. Instead, an ontology of becoming attends to the complex \nways in which bodies and images are entwined. This \u201cconstitutive relationality\u201d can be \nunderstood in terms of affect (rather than effect), that is through the ways in which bodies \nboth affect and are affected by other bodies and, further, become through these affects \n(Deleuze 1992). Conceiving bodies and images as in constant affective relations of \nproduction and transformation means that a finishing point for a feminist analysis of the \nrelations between them cannot be an account of the \u201cnegative effects\u201d of images on \nbodies. Such an account stops at the \u201cimpossibility\u201d of images rather than exploring how \nbodies (have to) continue to become through their relations with these images. Being \nunhappy, depressed or angry with a body are still kinds of becoming; a body does not \nstop becoming because it is unhappy, depressed or angry. A feminist approach to the \nrelations between bodies and images must seek to trace the becomings that relations with \nimages produce, and to examine the ways in which bodies become through affects which \nmight be conceived as \u201cimpossible\u201d. In this sense, I am arguing that the becoming of \nbodies is \u201cactualised\u201d8 in ways that produce limiting images of those bodies. Bodies and \nimages are not separate (body\/image) but, instead, bodies become through images (body-\nimage). \n \nIn this article I have attempted to demonstrate how the relations between the girls\u201f \nbodies and their own photographic images and \u201cmedia images\u201d limit and extend the \npossibilities of becomings. I suggested that, while it is relatively straightforward to \n 27 \nconceive photographic images as producing the becoming of bodies through the \nknowledges, understandings and experiences they produce, to think of media images in \nthe same way seems a more difficult endeavour. However, conceiving media images not \nas isolated images but as always in relations with other images, including domestic \nphotographs, opens up a way of seeing how they are not in relations of effect but rather \nthemselves limit or extend the becoming of the girls\u201f bodies. Both photographic images \nand media images involve the capture of a body as a particular spatial and temporal \nmoment and produce specific possibilities of becoming; both photographic and media \nimages produce knowledges, understandings and experiences of bodies through which \nthese bodies become. In the case of the girls who participated in my research, \nphotographs and media images produce knowledges of a body as multiple, as irreducible \nto that image. The multiplicity of a body, and the ways in which that multiplicity \nbecomes through relations with images, seems to me to be a productive area for feminist \nresearch to explore.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThanks to Mariam Fraser and Celia Lury for their help with the wider research from \nwhich this article comes, and to Debra Ferreday and Imogen Tyler for their instructive \ncomments on various drafts of this article. I would also like to thank the two anonymous \nreviewers for their very helpful engagement and suggestions. \n \nNotes \n 28 \n1. To draw attention to the problem of grouping images from different mediums \u2013 \nmagazine, television, film etc \u2013 under the umbrella term \u201cthe media\u201d, I have placed it \nwithin inverted commas. I am grateful to Imogen Tyler for bringing this point to my \nattention. \n2. These references, of course, do not include more general feminist media, cultural and \nsocial research concerned with the relations between women\u201fs bodies and images which \nis not empirical. See for example, Hollows (2003) on Nigella Lawson\u201fs cultural personae \non her television cooking programmes as the negotiation of feminism and femininity, \nBarnet-Weiser and  Portwood-Stacer (2006) on post-feminism and make-over television, \nWoods and Skeggs (2004) on the re-emergence of class in reality television, Davies \n(1995) on cosmetic surgery and Holliday and Sanchez Taylor (2006) on \u201caesthetic \nsurgery\u201d.  \n3. All of the research involved group interviews with teenage girls, and all used visual \nmaterials in some way. Grogan and Wainwright used pictures of food cut out from \nmagazines to focus the girls and Duke\u201fs interviews required the girls to read and discuss a \nteen magazine of their choice. In my research, the girls brought in their own photographs \nto discuss and one interview involved them making their own images. The girls in all of \nour research projects also raised issues of weight, beauty, fashion and appearance as \nimportant experiences of the relations between their bodies and images.   \n4. Deleuze\u201fs work is characterised by the concept of becoming and it is therefore difficult \nto point to any one work which deals with becoming. See Deleuze and Guattari (1987) \nand Deleuze (1991, 1992, 2001) as examples. For readers unfamiliar with Deleuze\u201fs \nwork, see Colebrook (2002) for an eloquent and insightful introduction to Deleuze\u201fs \n 29 \nwork, including a chapter on becoming. See Buchanan and Colebrook (2000) for a \ncollection on feminist theory and Deleuze, and Grosz (1999) for a collection on becoming \nand temporality. There is little published work that I know of that takes up Deleuze\u201fs \nwork to do empirical work, see Potts 2004 as one example.  \n5. apart from one where I interviewed two girls together. \n6. I do not have the space to develop this point here, but my argument is not that the girls\u201f \nknowledges of their bodies captured in photographs changes over time but rather that \nthese changing knowledges of bodies constitute time itself.  This is an understanding of \ntime not (only) as an external linear progression but rather as an internal, intuitive \nduration.  See Bergson (1999, 2002), Deleuze (1991) on this notion of temporality, Grosz \n(1999, 2005a, 2005b) for the relations between duration and becoming and Colebrook \n(2002) for an explanation of these terms in the work of Deleuze. \n7. I make this point because one common criticism levelled at the work of Deleuze is that \nthere is no account of power or inequality and that Deleuze\u201fs concepts focus only on the \nnew and exciting aspects of transformation.  This, I would suggest, is a mis-reading: \nDeleuze\u201fs work clearly points to the ways in which change involves repetition (2001) and \nimpossibilities as well as difference and potentialities.  Feminist theorists have also been \nkeen to demonstrate how Deleuze\u201fs work can open up ways of thinking about gender, \nsexuality and embodiment \u2013 see for example Buchanan and Colebrook (2000), Grosz \n(1994, 1999, 2005a, 2005b) and Braidotti (1994, 2002).   \n8. \u201cActualisation\u201d in the sense that I use it here has a quite specific meaning. In The Fold \n(2003) Deleuze has two sets of \u201ccouplings\u201d; the \u201cvirtual-actual\u201d and the \u201cpossible-real\u201d. \nThe real is what is realised of the possible, where the possible refers to \u201can infinity of \n 30 \npossible worlds\u201d (Deleuze 2003, p. 104). The actual is what is actualised of the virtual, \nwhere the virtual refers to a finite world, a world \u201cchosen\u201d out of the infinity of possible \nworlds. The virtual is therefore a finite world, or a finite set of potentialities, through \nwhich some potentialities are actualised (as opposed to an infinite set of potentialities, \nsome of which are realised). What is actualised, then, is in some way restricted through \nthe virtual. My argument here is that a body\u201fs becoming is not the realisation of an \ninfinite set of possibilities but an actualisation of a finite set of possibilities. This is also \nwhy I argue in note 7 that understanding Deleuze\u201fs work as having no concept of \nlimitation is a mis-reading. \n \n \nReferences \nBARNET-WEISER, SARAH PORTWOOD-STACER, LAURA (2006) \u201c\u201eI Just Want to \nbe me Again!\u201f Beauty Pageants, Reality Television and Post-Feminism\u201d, Feminist \nTheory, vol 7, no. 2, pp. 255-272. \n \nBERGSON, HENRI ([1903] 1999) An Introduction to Metaphysics, translated by T.
