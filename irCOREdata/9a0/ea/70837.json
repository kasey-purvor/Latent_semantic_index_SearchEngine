Introduction\n[2] The geomagnetic community is actively engaged in\nstudies of the effect of external influences on the total\nmagnetic field of the Earth. A major aspect of this work\nis the investigation of the contribution of magnetospheric\ncurrent systems to the Earth\u2019s magnetic field; these current\nsystems are, to a large extent, driven by the solar wind. In\norder to continue to develop our understanding, an accurate\ncharacterization of the magnetic fields generated by such\nexternal electric currents is required. As a step in this\ndirection, we have used data from the Cluster spacecraft\nto investigate the accuracy of the modeled magnetospheric\ncontribution to the whole Earth system magnetic field. Such\nefforts are greatly improved by close collaboration between\nthe geomagnetic and solar-terrestrial physics communities,\nwhich can facilitate the exchange of ideas and models\nbetween the two.\n[3] The semiempirical Tsyganenko magnetic field models\nhave been widely utilized in the space physics community\nfor many years. The 2001 version (T01) [Tsyganenko,\n2002a, 2002b] is constructed by considering the mathemat-\nical form of a number of individual current systems in the\nmagnetosphere. Data from a large number of spacecraft\nhave been used to define the parameters of the model using\na least squares fit to minimize the misfit of the full vectors\nof the external magnetic field.\n[4] The approach of semiempirical optimization, together\nwith the use of a number of variable parameters to model the\nvarious current systems, contrasts with the standard method\nin geomagnetism which involves solving the inversion\nproblem for the field geometry. In geomagnetism it is usually\nassumed that a scalar potential field can be used (i.e.,\nmeasurements are taken at a distance from the source region)\nand that the magnetic field can therefore be described using a\nspherical harmonic analysis [e.g., Blakely, 1996]. In the case\nof the inverse problem, the input data used to set the surface\nboundary values for the inversion are often from ground\nobservatories and low-altitude satellites. An example of this\napproach is the Comprehensive Model version 4, CM4\n[Sabaka et al., 2004] which includes terms describing the\nionospheric and magnetospheric contributions to the overall\ngeomagnetic field. The Dst [Sugiura and Kamei, 1991] and\nF10.7 indices [Covington, 1969] are used to parameterize the\nconditions, however the model is only valid for very quiet\nconditions.\n[5] The T01 model is driven by five input parameters:\nsolar wind dynamic pressure, solar wind speed, disturbance\nstorm time index (Dst, or its high time resolution counterpart\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, A06248, doi:10.1029\/2006JA012217, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of Liverpool,\nLiverpool, U.K.\n2Space Science and Technology Department, Rutherford Appleton\nLaboratory, Chilton, U.K.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2006JA012217$09.00\nA06248 1 of 15\nSYM-H [Wanliss and Showalter, 2006]) and the interplan-\netary magnetic field (IMF) components in the YGSM and\nZGSM directions. These quantities define the various variable\ncoefficients within the model that are dependent on the\nexternal inputs. The model also requires a short time history\nof external inputs to the magnetosphere, following the\nunderstanding that the reaction of the magnetosphere\ndepends on its previous state.\n[6] In order to assess the accuracy of the T01 model, we\nhave compared the model output to magnetic field data from\nthe Cluster mission [Escoubet et al., 2001]. Orbits separated\nin time but in-phase relative to the Earth\u2019s magnetic dipole\nare compared, such that a very similar region of the\nmagnetosphere is sampled. The initial investigation focuses\non two pairs of orbits. The results from this small sample\nare shown to recur in an analysis of 2 full years of data. A\ncomparison with Cluster data provides an independent\nassessment of the accuracy of T01, since these data are\nnot included in the empirical database of the model. This\ncomparison also allows the actual behavior observed by\nCluster to be assessed in a large-scale context.\n2. Data Sources\n2.1. T01\n[7] Since the T01 model represents only the magneto-\nspheric contribution to the overall magnetic field, we have\nused the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF)\nversion 10 [Maus et al., 2005] as the Earth\u2019s internal\nmagnetic field in order to model the full magnetic field at\nthe Cluster orbit. The IGRF is now defined to spherical\nharmonic degree 13 due to the inclusion of data from low\naltitude satellites such as \u00d8rsted, CHAMP and SAC-C. This\nis a significant improvement over previous versions of the\nmodel and the accuracy of the IGRF version 10 internal\nfield is sufficient that the errors for space physics applica-\ntions are negligible. The following analysis assumes that\nboth the ionospheric and crustal contributions to the mag-\nnetic field at the altitude of the Cluster orbit are not\nsignificant.\n[8] The mathematical structure of the T01 model includes\nall the major magnetospheric current systems: ring current,\ncross-tail current, magnetopause current, field-aligned cur-\nrents, and the interplanetary magnetic field penetration.\nImportant features of the structure of these currents are\nsummarized below; for a full description the reader is referred\nto Tsyganenko [2002a, 2002b] and references therein. The\nring current includes both an axisymmetric and a partial ring\ncurrent with field-aligned closure currents. The cross-tail\ncurrent sheet, which is allowed to warp in response to the\ngeodipole tilt, has a thickness that varies both across and\nalong the tail. The location of the inner edge of this current\nsheet along the Sun-Earth line varies with changing geomag-\nnetic disturbance levels. The contribution of the magneto-\npause currents to the total magnetic field is represented using\na potential field. This magnetic field, when added to the field\nfrom internal sources, provides the required distribution\nof the net normal component at the model boundary. The\ngeneral magnetopause shape is defined by the empirical\nmodel of Shue et al. [1998] and is also allowed to be\ngeodipole tilt-dependent. The field aligned current (FAC)\nrepresentation includes both region 1 and region 2 field-\naligned currents [Iijima and Potemra, 1976] which are\nallowed to vary with interplanetary conditions such that\ntheir ionospheric footprint can move in latitude. Finally,\nthe interconnection field controlled by the interplanetary\nmagnetic field allows the model magnetosphere to assume\nopen configurations (by allowing a finite B normal to the\nmagnetopause).\n[9] The magnitude of the total T01 magnetic field within\n\u00b11 hour of Cluster perigee can reach of the order of tens of\nnano-Tesla. The majority of this is due to the ring current as,\nat perigee, Cluster is close to 4 RE radial distance. This is in\naddition to the dominant contribution from the Earth\u2019s\ninternal magnetic field of hundreds of nano-Tesla (obtained\nfrom the IGRF).\n[10] For the intervals covered in this paper, the interplan-\netary input data for the T01 model (i.e., solar wind dynamic\npressure, IMF BY and BZ) was level 2 data from the\nSWEPAM [McComas et al., 1998] and MAG [Smith et\nal., 1998] instruments on the ACE spacecraft. These data\nhave been propagated to the subsolar bowshock in a simple\nfashion using the known distance of ACE from the Earth\n(230 RE) and placing the bowshock subsolar position at\n15 RE. We have used the ambient bulk speed to calculate the\nconvection time, taking the arrival time at the magneto-\nsphere to be the same as that at the bowshock. A 1 hour time\nhistory of solar wind data was used to calculate the\nparameters g1 and g2 [Tsyganenko, 2002b]. The geomag-\nnetic activity input to T01 is provided by the SYM-H index.\n2.2. Cluster\n[11] The four identical spacecraft that form the Cluster\nconstellation [Escoubet et al., 2001] are in an elliptical, polar\norbit with a period of approximately 57 hours, a perigee of\n\u00014 RE and an apogee of \u000119.6 RE. The Cluster orbit\nprecesses such that every year all magnetic local times\n(MLT) are covered. The spacecraft are arranged in a tetrahe-\ndron, the spatial scale of which varies between 100 km and a\nfewRE. Each Cluster spacecraft has 11 experiments on board;\nhere, we have used data from the fluxgate-magnetometer\n(FGM) [Balogh et al., 2001], and the Research with Adaptive\nParticle Imaging Detectors (RAPID) experiment [Wilken et\nal., 2001]. In-flight calibrations on the FGM data routinely\ndetermine the maximum offset in the data for each spacecraft\nto within 0.1 nT. The RAPID spectrometer provides supra-\nthermal plasma distributions of electrons (Imaging Electron\nSpectrometer (IES) instrument), protons and heavier ions\n(Imaging Ion Mass Spectrometer (IIMS) instrument). The\nenergy range of the IES, data from which is used in the\npresent study, is some 40 to 450 keV.\n3. Method\n[12] We use a combination of two approaches to compare\ndifferent Cluster orbits as consistently as possible to reveal\npertinent features in the data. First, we have identified pairs\nof complete orbits for which the perigee times of which are\nseparated by an integer multiple of 24 hours, to ensure that\nthe dipole phasing is as similar as possible for each pair, i.e.,\nthe spacecraft are most likely to be going through the same\nmagnetospheric region. The smallest separation that meets\nthis criterion is 19 days (8 full orbits). Second, we have\nproduced plots with a time axis that is relative to the time of\nA06248 WOODFIELD ET AL.: CLUSTER COMPARISON TO TSYGANENKO 2001\n2 of 15\nA06248\nperigee for the selected orbits, in the style of a superposed\nepoch study.\n[13] In the following assessment of T01 performance, the\nresiduals are formed by subtracting the model values (T01\nplus IGRF) from the data (note that we have used absolute\nrather than percentage residuals). Geocentric Solar Magnetic\n(GSM) coordinates are used throughout. Cluster orbits are\nby convention numbered from perigee to perigee; for our\npurposes we have combined two half orbits to generate a set\nof data for a full orbit centered on perigee. Only data from\nthe Cluster spacecraft 1 are shown, but the analysis has been\ncarried out for all four spacecraft. We are investigating long\ntimescale features in the data so the spin-resolution FGM\ndata has been reduced to 1 min resolution (by selecting data\npoints on minute boundaries). We will analyze two orbits for\nwhich the Cluster perigee was on the dawnside and two\nwhen perigee was postnoon. This is followed by a general\ndiscussion of data from the whole of 2003 and 2004.\n4. Results\n4.1. Dawnside Perigee\n[14] Figure 1 shows two perigee passes separated by\n8 orbits. The solid line shows the Cluster spacecraft 1\ntrajectory for orbit A (4 December 2003), and the dashed\nline orbit B (23 December 2003; see Table 1 for full date\nand perigee time details). Universal time (UT) and radial\ndistance to the satellite in Earth radii (r) are marked every\n2 hours. The location of the spacecraft is superimposed on\nmagnetic field lines generated from T01 (dotted lines) using\nthe conditions: proton density = 2.0 cm\u00023, solar wind bulk\nvelocity = 400 km s\u00021, Dst = \u000210 nT, IMF BY = 0.0 nT,\nand IMF BZ = 1.0 nT. During both of the intervals shown,\nthe spacecraft moves from the afternoon sector south of the\nmagnetic equator through perigee on the dawnside to the\npremidnight sector north of the equator. Cluster 1 passed\nthrough or near the outer radiation belt or ring current near\nto perigee. During both intervals, observations from ACE\nshowed that the solar wind dynamic pressure was steady at\n\u00011.5 nPa, IMF BZ varied between \u00025 nT and +5 nT and\nIMF BYGSM varied between \u00025 nT and +3 nT.\n[15] Figure 2a shows the differential electron number\nflux for the perigee pass of orbit A taken from the RAPID-\nIES instrument on Cluster spacecraft 1. The region of high\nelectron flux observed by RAPID corresponds to the ring\ncurrent population. Approximate times of entry into and exit\nfrom the ring current have each been marked by vertical\ndashed lines, identified from the lowest IES energy channel.\nFigure 2b shows the GSM components of magnetic field\nfrom Cluster 1. There is an interesting feature in the BX\ncomponent between approximately 0100 and 0430 UT\nwhere this component is suppressed. All four Cluster space-\ncraft as well as T01 show the same feature. During this time\nCluster 1 is located in a region of field lines which have been\nswept into the southern tail lobe where the magnetic field\nwill be significantly influenced by the region 1 FAC. The\nprevailing conditions favor an enhanced region 1 current\nsystem (many hours of weak but steadily southward IMF BZ\nprior to the data shown and a sunlit southern ionosphere).\nFigure 1. Orbital plots in GSM coordinates for orbits A (solid line) and B (dashed line). The dotted\nlines are magnetic field lines traced using T01 for the conditions: proton density = 2.0 cm\u00023, solar wind\nbulk velocity = 400 km s\u00021, Dst = \u000210 nT, IMF BY = 0.0 nT, and IMF BZ = 1.0 nT.\nA06248 WOODFIELD ET AL.: CLUSTER COMPARISON TO TSYGANENKO 2001\n3 of 15\nA06248\nThe corresponding tailward enhancement in magnetic field\nwould reduce BX. An estimate can be made for the reduction\nin this component using a magnetic field value of \u0001200 to\n300 nT for the low-altitude region 1 field and then dividing\nthis by the factor (r)3\/2 [Tsyganenko, 2002a]. This yields an\nestimate of \u000110 nT to 20 nT reduction in BX which agrees\nwith that observed. The success of T01 in modeling this\nfeature indicates the benefit of including a magnetospheric\nhistory in the model.\n[16] Figures 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d show the results of our\ncalculation of the residuals dBX, dBY, dBZ, and djBj for\nboth passes (dB = BObserved \u0002 BT01+IGRF, djBj =\njBObservedj \u0002 jBT01+IGRFj) for the perigee passes of orbits\nA and B. Figure 3e shows the total magnetic field magnitude\nmeasured by Cluster 1 and Figure 3f gives the SYM-H\nindex. The x-axis shows time relative to perigee for each of\nthe two orbits. The vertical dashed lines correspond to those\nshown in Figure 2 demarking the estimated limits of the ring\ncurrent for orbit A; the vertical dotted lines correspond to the\nring current limits for orbit B (RAPID data for this interval is\nnot shown). There is a remarkable similarity between the\nresiduals from these two orbits, particularly in dBX and dBY\n(Figures 3a and 3b), even though they are separated by\naround 19 days. A prominent feature is the sharp signatures\nobserved in all three components before (\u0001\u00022 hours) and\nafter perigee (\u0001+1 hour). The location of the bipolar features\nis closely aligned with the edge of the ring current during\nboth perigee passes. The shape of the feature also stays\nremarkably similar.\n[17] Both orbits could be described as geomagnetically\nquiet with the SYM-H index greater than\u000220 nT (Figure 3f).\nSYM-H for orbit A is \u000110 nT higher than for the second\norbit. The fact that the sharp signatures are observed in a\nsimilar form in two orbits 19 days apart indicates that this is\nprobably a stable feature of the magnetosphere.\n[18] In addition to the sharp feature in the residuals there is\nalso a noticeable longer-lived, slow variation observed in\ndBX and dBY through perigee, corresponding to the space-\ncraft being in the ring current. The correlation in dBX\nbetween the two well-separated orbits is very good from\n\u00022 hours to +5 hours, and in dBY from\u00022.5 hours to perigee.\nThe same cannot be said for dBZ, particularly when the\nspacecraft are in the ring current region, and consequently the\nresidual in the field magnitude is also not consistent between\nthe two orbits. The offset between the data and the predicted\nvalue of the magnetic field within the ring current reaches a\nmaximum of approximately 10 nT.\n[19] In Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c an analysis of the model\nresults is presented for the three component magnetic fields\nin orbit A. The solid line shows the external model field\npredicted by T01 (BEM = BT01), and the dotted line is the\nCluster 1 data minus the IGRF (i.e., the observed external\nfield, BEO = BObserved \u0002 BIGRF). The dashed line shows the\nresiduals in the field components (dB = BObserved \u0002\nTable 1.

If T01 gave\na perfect representation of the external magnetic field the\nsolid line and the dotted line would be identical. The sharp\nchanges noted in the residual component fields in Figure 3\nare mostly bipolar in shape. This characteristic is signifi-\ncant: if it originates in the data, it suggests that Cluster may\nbe passing through, or close to, a tube or sheet of current,\nsuch as one would expect for an FAC. The components of\nthe observed external fields are indeed consistent with the\nspacecraft passing a sheet of current. We can further test this\nhypothesis by comparing the measured magnetic field\nmagnitude with that predicted by the models. If there is\nlittle change in magnitude during the bipolar signature, it\nwill indicate that the magnetic field change is perpendicular\nto the main field as expected from FAC. In contrast an\nincrease (decrease) in magnetic field magnitude will indi-\ncate that the magnetic field change is parallel (antiparallel)\nto the main field.\n[20] This test is made in Figure 4d, which shows the\ndifference between the magnitude of the total observed,\nand modeled, magnetic field and the magnitude of the\ninternal field, i.e., jBObservedj \u0002 jBIGRFj (dotted line) and\njBT01+IGRFj \u0002 jBIGRFj (solid line). Also shown is the\nresidual in the total magnitudes djBj = jBObservedj \u0002\njBT01+IGRFj (dashed line). jBObservedj \u0002 jBIGRFj shows very\nlittle change during the bipolar signatures and thus supports\nthe hypothesis that these are the result of an FAC. Using the\nvertical dashed lines from Figure 2 as a guide to the ring\ncurrent location the bipolar signatures in the residuals are\nlocated on the edge of the ring current. This indicates these\nfeatures are likely to be due to region 2 FAC. The residual in\nthe total magnitudes (dashed line) shows that there is a\ngeneral overestimate of the depression in the magnitude of\nthe magnetic field within the ring current region by approx-\nimately 10 nT.\n[21] Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c show that there are marked\ndeflections in the T01 predictions of the BEM in the same\nregion that BEO shows FAC signatures. However, T01 gives\na poor estimate of the field strength arising from this current\nsystem. For example at 0400 UT the T01 estimate of BX,EM\nchanges abruptly (presumably indicating the poleward edge\nof the region 2 FAC system in the model), but BX,EO shows\nFigure 3.

The clear demarcation between the FAC region\nand the ring current, shown by the change in the slope of BX\nat \u00010450 UT, is well matched in time for the model and the\nobservations. So the location of the FAC region is well\nestimated in the model for BX,EM; however, the detailed\nmorphology of the region is missing. In BY,EM, there is very\nlittle change in the model field; this does not match the\nobservations. Although the timing in BZ,EM could be said to\nbe approximately correct, the detailed changes in the\nmagnitude of that component are not well predicted. In\ncrossing the northern FAC region (\u00010715 UT), the devia-\ntions in BEO are smaller than the southern crossing, but\nBEM shows large, well-defined changes.\n[22] Figure 5 is in the same format as the previous figure\nbut shows the results from the perigee pass of orbit B. As in\nthe case of orbit A, the differences in the magnitudes in\nFigure 5d show no significant variation due to the sharp\nchanges in the individual components at the edges of the\nring current; this is consistent with the expected behavior of\nan FAC. In contrast to orbit A, the depression in the total\nfield magnitude due to the ring current is underestimated in\norbit B. As in orbit A, the signature in the BEM components\nat ring current entry is different to that predicted on exit\n(crossing into the ring current T01 predicts a much smaller\nFAC). In contrast, the FAC signatures in BEO are of\ncomparable magnitude for ring current entry and exit. T01\npredicts a weaker FAC than the observed change to BEO\nwhen going into the ring current in all three components but\noverestimates significantly the effect of the FAC on exiting\nthe ring current in BX,EO and BZ,EO (by \u000120 nT).\n4.2. Dayside, Postnoon Perigee\n[23] Figure 6 shows the perigee passes from two Cluster\norbits, in which perigee was on the dayside in the postnoon\nsector; the solid line represents orbit C (21 July 2003) and\nthe dashed line orbit D (9 August 2003; see Table 1 for\nmore details). Both these orbital paths take Cluster 1 from\nthe postmidnight sector south of the magnetic equator\nnorthward through perigee in the afternoon sector back to\nthe postmidnight sector (north of the equator). When\nperigee is on the dayside, the Cluster orbit passes close to\nthe ring current, but then often passes through one or other\nof the midaltitude cusps (see, e.g., the study by Vallat et al.\n[2005]).\nFigure 4. External magnetic field prediction, data, and residuals from orbit A, where (a, b, c) the solid\nline shows the external magnetic field predicted by T01 (BEM), the dotted line shows the observed\nexternal field (BEO) and the dashed line the difference between the two (dB). Also shown is (d) the\ndifferences between the magnitudes as indicated in the legend. The vertical dashed line shows the time of\nperigee.\nA06248 WOODFIELD ET AL.: CLUSTER COMPARISON TO TSYGANENKO 2001\n6 of 15\nA06248\n[24] Figure 7 shows the RAPID-IES data and full\nBObserved components in the same format as Figure 2, but\nfor the perigee pass orbit C. Figure 7a shows that the energy\nspectrogram of the energetic electrons is different from that\nin orbit A (and orbit B). Orbit C (and D) presents a more\nasymmetrical appearance with time which may be an indi-\ncation of a different approach of the spacecraft into the ring\ncurrent. As before, the edge of the ring current is marked\napproximately using the vertical dashed lines.\n[25] Figure 8 presents the magnetic field residuals for this\nsecond pair of orbits in the same format as Figure 3. As in\norbits A and B, the geomagnetic activity level is quiet, with\nSYM-H greater than \u000225 nT. For orbit D SYM-H is around\n10 nT greater than that from orbit C. During the 10 hour\ninterval centered on perigee for orbit C, the solar wind\ndynamic pressure was \u00010.5 nPa, IMF BY varied between\n\u00027 nT and \u00022 nT, and IMF BZ between \u00023 nT and +3 nT.\nFor the equivalent part of orbit D, the dynamic pressure was\n\u00012 nPa, IMF BYvaried between \u00026 nT and +3 nT, and IMF\nBZ between \u00023 nT and +5 nT.\n[26] The residuals for the two orbits, despite being\nseparated by \u000119 days, show very similar structure. There\nis no obvious sharp signature in the residuals corresponding\nto ring current entry for either orbit C or D (in contrast to\norbits A and B). It is possible that the absence of a bipolar\nsignature in the magnetic field residuals is related to the\ndifferent entry path of Cluster into the ring current. There is\na very clear bipolar feature in all three magnetic field\ncomponents an hour after perigee, near the time at which\nthe Cluster 1 exited the ring current. The bipolar signature\nin the spacecraft data is large enough to register in both the\nBX and BY components of the total field (Figure 7b).\n[27] An analysis of the contributions to the residuals in\nFigure 8 is given in Figures 9 and 10 for orbits C and D,\nrespectively. The bipolar feature is evident in the observed\nexternal BEO data as well as the residuals. In orbit C, the\nT01 estimate of the FAC location is close to that observed\nand the BEM components change in the same senses as the\nBEO components; however, the size of the FAC magnetic\nsignature is underestimated by about a factor of two to\nthree. In orbit D there is a very similar, large bipolar feature\nin BEO after perigee but very little indication of FAC in\nBEM. Signatures from the bipolar changes in the magnetic\nfield components do not occur in the magnitude of the total\nFigure 5.

This is consistent with the\npresence of FACs. The residuals of the total magnetic field\nin orbits C and D show that the ring current field depression\nis underestimated by T01 (as it was for orbit B).\n4.3. Full Year Analysis\n[28] The features identified in the case studies of mag-\nnetic residuals presented above are characteristic of much of\nthe 2003 and 2004 perigee data. A summary of the perigee\ndata from every orbit during 2003 and 2004 is presented in\nFigures 11 and 12, respectively; as before data are reduced\nto 1-min resolution. Figures 11a to 11d and 12a to 12d show\nthe residuals between the observed field and the modeled\nfield, dBX, dBY, dBZ, and djBj, respectively. Figures 11e\nand 12e present SYM-H and Figures 11f and 12f present\nIMF BZ. Each parameter is color coded according to its\nvalue and plotted as a function of orbit number (x-axis) and\ntime in hours relative to perigee (y-axis). The x-axis of each\nfigure covers a full year starting in January. Figure 13 shows\nthe Cluster 1 perigee locations in the GSM X-Y plane for\n2003 with the orbit numbers superimposed (compare to\norbit numbers in Table 1). This figure shows how the local\ntime of perigee precesses through the magnetosphere during\n2003; a very similar precession occurs in 2004.\n[29] Figures 11a and 11b and to a lesser extent Figure 11c\nshow that the bipolar signatures (indicated by the sharp\nchanges in color) are a common feature of the residuals. A\nclear example of this can be seen in Figure 11b, between\n+1 and +2 hours away from perigee for a number of orbits\naround 480. A comparison with similar figures showing\nthe components of BEO (not shown) indicate that these\nsharp changes are colocated with bipolar signatures in the\nobserved external field components. Figure 11b shows that\nthey are less frequent around the spring equinox when the\nCluster perigee is on the nightside. During this time there is\ninstead a more long-lived reversal in dBY, starting \u00012 hours\nbefore perigee and ending \u00012 hours after. A similar slow\nreversal is observed in dBX (Figure 11a) from approximately\norbit 475 to 500. The residuals vary from about +5 nT to\n\u00025 nT, while Cluster 1 is within the ring current region. The\ngradual trends observed are consistent with the changing\nlocation of the perigee of the orbits as the year progresses.\nFigure 8. Results from two orbits of Cluster 1 separated by \u000119 days; orbit C (solid line) and orbit D\n(dotted line). The x-axis is time relative to the perigee for each orbit, showing (a, b, c, d) residuals (data-\nmodel) of the magnetic field in GSM coordinates, (e) the magnetic field magnitude from Cluster 1 for the\ntwo orbits, and (f) the SYM-H magnetic activity index for each case. The two dashed and two dotted\nvertical lines correspond to the estimate of the ring current limits for orbits C and D, respectively.\nA06248 WOODFIELD ET AL.: CLUSTER COMPARISON TO TSYGANENKO 2001\n9 of 15\nA06248\n[30] In 2003, dBZ and djBj (Figures 11c and 11d) show a\nwell-defined trough in values spanning 1 to 2 hours around\nperigee. Since the perigee of the Cluster orbit is close to\nthe magnetic equator in 2003 (and 2004), it is reasonable\nto assume that at this time djBj will be dominated by the\nZ component of the magnetic field. The negative residual\nindicates that T01 is underestimating the field depression in\nthis region due to the ring current. In contrast to this, away\nfrom perigee the tendency is for T01 to overestimate the\nmagnitude of the total magnetic field although there are\nsome exceptions to this. For example, from \u00024 to \u00022 hours\nrelative to perigee in the first quarter of 2003 the fit of the\nmodel to the data in djBj is very good (area 1). This\ncoincides with generally positive residuals in BZ and BX.\nThere are two other areas where the residuals of the total\nfield and the Z component are close to zero. The first occurs\nat the same relative orbital time, \u00024 to \u00022 hours, but\nextends from orbit \u0001480 to 510 (area 2). The second\nextends from 4 to 6 hours after perigee for orbits \u0001400 to\n440 (area 3); this corresponds to a region of small to\npositive residuals in dBY. So we see that there are regions\nof the magnetosphere that are consistently slightly misrep-\nresented in the model, and other regions where the model\nfits the data much better.\n[31] Overall 2004 was a less geomagnetically active year\nas reflected by fewer large negative values in the plot of\nSYM-H (see Figure 12e). Nevertheless, the bipolar signa-\ntures in the residuals are still apparent, in roughly the same\nlocation as in 2003. The longer-lived reversals in the X and\nY residuals lasting some 4 hours centered on perigee are\nstill visible on this scale, but are much smaller than the\nprevious year. The trough in djBj close to perigee disap-\npears part way through 2004 to be replaced by a peak in\ndjBj of similar time extent. There is no clear indication from\neither the SYM-H index or the IMF BZ data of why this\nshould occur. The other regions (areas 1, 2, and 3) identified\nin the 2003 data where djBj was close to zero do seem to\nrecur in 2004, although at slightly different local times.\nThese last three features are all apparent in dBZ as positive\nresiduals and there are no obvious connections to the dBX\nand dBY residuals in this year.\n[32] Overall, the 2 years show some broadly similar\nfeatures in the residuals including the bipolar signatures\nidentified as FACs. Other larger\/longer-lived features are\nFigure 9.

The reason for\nthis is not yet clear.\n5. Discussion\n[33] The comparison of four case events and 2 full years\nof Cluster spacecraft 1 magnetic field data with predictions\nfrom the Tsyganenko 2001 model indicate the frequent\noccurrence of sharp features in the residual values (data\nminus model) in all three GSM magnetic field components.\nThese signatures are often bipolar in form and are observed\nagain 19 days later indicating the presence of a stable or\nrecurring current structure. The comparison also reveals\nlonger duration features in the residuals close to perigee\nthat are not necessarily consistent between pairs of in-phase\norbits but can be observed over a longer time period.\n5.1. Sharp Residual Features\n[34] Initially, we presented dawnside perigee passes from\ntwo orbits, separated by \u000119 days (sufficient to bring the\ndipole back in phase). The residuals between the Cluster\nmagnetic field data and the T01 model output revealed two\nbipolar features in all three components, one prior to perigee\nand one after. These features were repeated in almost the\nsame form in both orbits, 19 days apart. In orbits A and B,\nthe preperigee feature shape is due to the data, since the\nmodel exhibits only smooth changes (Figures 4 and 5). The\nsame figures show that the postperigee feature is heavily\ninfluenced by rapid changes in the model field but is still\nmainly in the data.\n[35] We then presented data from two dayside, postnoon\nperigee passes, which again revealed very distinct bipolar\nsignatures but this time only after perigee. Again, these\nresidual signatures are mostly due to the observed data since\nthe T01 results significantly underestimated the magnetic\nchanges in this region. The bipolar shape of the signatures\nseen in the data implies that Cluster 1 may be passing\nthrough an FAC which is not adequately reproduced by the\nmodel. In addition, the total magnetic field magnitude (and\nits residual) shows no prominent features at the time these\nbipolar signatures are observed. The constant value of the\nfield magnitude through the bipolar feature is consistent\nFigure 10. External magnetic field prediction, data and residuals from orbit D, where (a, b, c) the solid\nline shows the external magnetic field predicted by T01 (BEM), the dotted line shows the observed\nexternal field (BEO), and the dashed line the difference between the two (dB). Also shown are (d) the\ndifferences between the magnitudes as indicated in the legend. The vertical dashed line shows the time of\nperigee.\nA06248 WOODFIELD ET AL.: CLUSTER COMPARISON TO TSYGANENKO 2001\n11 of 15\nA06248\nwith the idea of electric current flowing along magnetic\nfield lines. Therefore we believe these features to be\nsignatures of FACs; their consistency over time leading\ntoward the conclusion that they are due to the large-scale\nBirkeland current system.\n[36] The addition of particle data from the same space-\ncraft facilitates an accurate determination of the magneto-\nspheric location of these bipolar signatures. The Cluster\nRAPID-IES instrument shows the enhanced energetic elec-\ntron flux of the ring current\/outer radiation belt. This places\nthe observed FACs on or near the edge of the ring current.\nThe morphology of the Birkeland current system suggested\nby Iijima and Potemra [1976] has the region 2 system\nclosing via the ring current. It is therefore possible that the\nFACs we have observed were part of the region 2 current\ncircuit. This is in agreement with Vallat et al. [2005] where\nthe authors used the four Cluster spacecraft to estimate the\ncurrent using the curlometer technique [e.g., Dunlop et al.,\n2002]. They found FAC signatures at the edge of the ring\ncurrent and associated these currents with the region 2\nsystem. A curlometer analysis has not been included here\nsince the quality is expected to be low in view of the\nspacecraft configuration in some of the relevant regions in\nthese orbits.\n[37] The T01 model takes a detailed approach to model-\ning the region 1 and 2 Birkeland currents, including the\nchange of ionospheric latitude with activity, dipole tilt-\nrelated deformation and the observed day-night asymmetry\n[Tsyganenko, 2002a]. It is a difficult task to model these\nFAC systems realistically, and any attempt to include them\nin a global model is almost certain to be a simplification as a\nmatter of necessity. In general we find that T01 models the\nlocation of the observed FAC system signatures well but the\nmagnitude and fine structure are not so well reproduced. It\nis unrealistic to expect the model to be able to accurately\nestimate the detailed structure; however, it is of prime\nconcern to obtain a realistic prediction of the magnitude\nthat the effect the FAC system has on the magnetic field. As\nthe individual events showed, the intensity of the magnetic\nfield perturbation due to the FAC system varies greatly. This\nincreases the need for accurate and large data sets to be used\nin generating a model. The results presented here demon-\nFigure 11. Plots for the whole of 2003. Each vertical strip is a section of an orbit; the x-axis is the orbit\nnumber, y-axis is time relative to perigee, and the color scale is the value of (a) dBX, (b) dBY, (c) dBZ,\n(d) djBj, (e) SYM-H, and (f) IMF BZ.\nA06248 WOODFIELD ET AL.: CLUSTER COMPARISON TO TSYGANENKO 2001\n12 of 15\nA06248\nstrate the need for empirical models of the external field to\nexploit Cluster magnetic field measurements, especially in\nthe Birkeland current region.\n[38] The time that the FACs are encountered with respect\nto perigee alters over the course of a year as the plane of the\nCluster orbit precesses through 24 hours in local time. It\nwould be expected, given the day-night asymmetry men-\ntioned above, that orbits with a dayside perigee would\nobserve any region 2 current signatures further towards the\npoles [see, e.g., Tsyganenko, 2002a, Figure 4]. This is in\nagreement with our results; the FAC signatures occur further\naway from perigee from about July to December (Figures 11\nand 12).\n5.2. Longer-Duration Features in the Residuals\n[39] In the individual events studied in sections 4.1 and\n4.2 there were offsets between the T01 model output and the\nCluster 1 data that extended around perigee while Cluster 1\nwas inside the ring current. These offsets were longer-lived\n(\u00012 hours) than those mentioned in the previous section.\nThere was a reasonable degree of consistency in dBX and\ndBY between the in-phase orbits in each case (Figures 4, 5, 9,\nand 10). The same could not be said of dBZ and djBj in the\nfirst perigee pass. The recurrence of these ring current\nresiduals persists in the 2 year long analysis. In the\ncorresponding parts of Figure 11 (orbit A, numbered 528\/\n529, and B, 536\/537, for the dawnside perigee orbits, C, 471\/\n472, and D, 479\/480, for postnoon perigee) there are positive\nfollowed by negative residuals within one orbit (or vice\nversa as applicable) which correspond to the recurring ring\ncurrent residuals. Figure 11 shows that these continue over\ngreater times than just the 19 days examined here in detail\nbut also that the morphology of the residuals changes as the\nCluster orbital path precesses in local time. These patterns in\nthe residuals indicate that there is a small but systematic\noffset in the model from the magnetic field that is measured\nby Cluster when it is inside the ring current during large\nperiods of 2003.\n[40] The T01 model achieves better results during 2004,\nproducing smaller residuals throughout the year, possibly\ndue to the overall slightly quieter magnetic conditions\n(compare Figures 11e and 12e). Since no data from 2003\nFigure 12. Plots for the whole of 2004. Each vertical strip is a section of an orbit; the x-axis is the orbit\nnumber, y-axis is time relative to perigee, and the color scale is the value of (a) dBX, (b) dBY, (c) dBZ,\n(d) djBj, (e) SYM-H, and (f) IMF BZ.\nA06248 WOODFIELD ET AL.: CLUSTER COMPARISON TO TSYGANENKO 2001\n13 of 15\nA06248\nor 2004 are included in the T01 database, perhaps the 2004\nconditions more closely resemble those included in the\ndatabase (which covers 1984 to 1999). Both 2003 and\n2004 are in the declining phase of solar cycle 23 which\npeaked in April 2000.\n[41] The other clear feature in the 2003 data is the\u00011 hour\nlong burst of negative residuals in the total magnetic field\naround perigee. This is consistent throughout the entire year\n(with a couple of brief exceptions). This trend then reverses\ndramatically approximately halfway into 2004 such that\nthere is a burst of positive residuals around perigee for the\nrest of the year. The dominant component of the total field at\nthis location is the Z direction (perigee is close to the\nmagnetic equator); dBZ also undergoes a change in the\nsecond half of 2004. What causes this sudden alteration in\nthe pattern is unclear, but it means that an improvement to\nT01 to remedy the original trough of negative residuals is\nprobably not viable, at least until the source of the change in\n2004 can be identified.\n[42] Outside of the ring current region and beyond the\nFAC signatures there are other regions that show very small\nresidual values and semi-persistent behavior as mentioned\nin section 4.3. These occur in djBj and can be matched\nprimarily to positive residual regions in dBZ (Figures 11c\nand 12c) but also in places dBX and dBY. These features last\nfor approximately three months and also appear in both\nyears of data. There is an initial indication that at least one\nof these patches (between \u00022 and \u00024 hours relative to\nperigee in 2003, for approximately orbits 390 to 420) shows\na reaction to changes in the IMF BZ. The IMF BZ changes\nsign in a periodic manner during this time; corresponding\nchanges in the sign of the residual are also observed. This is\nan interesting point and worthy of further investigation.\n6. Conclusion\n[43] An investigation of Cluster data in comparison with\nthe T01 model has been carried out. We have found\ncommonly observed offsets between the Tsyganenko 2001\nmodel and Cluster magnetic field data (of the order of 20 nT)\nwhich take the form of bipolar signatures. These can be\nobserved in a similar form 19 days later when the dipole\nphase of Cluster is most closely matched. These are found\nto be indicative of field-aligned currents, probably part of\nthe region 2 current system. The T01 model gauges the\nlocation and duration of the FAC signatures well in general\nbut our results show the magnitude of the magnetic field\nchanges is not so well predicted. Our results indicate that\nthe T01 model would benefit from the inclusion of Cluster\nmagnetic field data in the calculation of the model param-\neters. The location of these bipolar features has been\nidentified to be close to the edges of the ring current, using\nelectron energy spectrograms from the same spacecraft.\nThis is consistent with our suggestion that the bipolar\nsignatures are the result of region 2 currents. On the dayside\nthe effects are slightly more complex, being influenced by\nthe presence of the midaltitude cusp region, and are asym-\nmetrically sampled by Cluster. Nevertheless, these FAC\nobservations are also observed to follow the expected\nday-night asymmetry of the region 2 system.\n[44] Less systematic trends in the offsets between the data\nand the model have also been found when Cluster is both\nFigure 13.

However, not all\nof these are consistent from year to year, and it would\ntherefore be hard to improve upon T01 without an accurate\nindication of their physical source. Future work will there-\nfore investigate the cause of these longer-term trends along\nwith the factors controlling the magnitude of the region\n2 FAC magnetic signatures.\n[45] Acknowledgments.
