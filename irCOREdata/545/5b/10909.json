It is widely assumed that soils with a higher\nfungal biomass have lower N losses, but this relationship has never been experimentally con\ufb01rmed. With\nthe increased interest in soil-based ecosystem services and sustainable management of soils, such a rela-\ntionship would be relevant for agricultural management. Here we present a \ufb01rst attempt to test this\nrelationship experimentally. We used intact soil columns from two plots from a \ufb01eld experiment that had\nconsistent differences in fungal biomass (68\u0001 8 vs.111\u0001 9 mg C g\u00031) as a result of different fertilizer history\n(80 vs. 40 kg N ha\u00031 y\u00031 as farmyardmanure), while other soil properties were very similar.We performed\ntwo greenhouse experiments: in the main experiment the columns received either mineral fertilizer N or\nno N (control). We measured N leaching, N2O emission and denitri\ufb01cation from the columns during 4\nweeks, after which we analyzed fungal and bacterial biomass and soil N pools. In the additional 15N\nexperiment we traced added N in leachates, soil, plants and microbial biomass. We found that in the main\nexperiment, N2O emission and denitri\ufb01cation were lower in the high fungal biomass soil, irrespective of\nthe addition of fertilizer N. Higher 15N recovery in the high fungal biomass soil also indicated lower N losses\nthrough dentri\ufb01cation. In the main experiment, N leaching after fertilizer addition showed a 3-fold\nincrease compared to the control in low fungal biomass soil (11.9 \u0001 1.0 and 3.9 \u0001 1.0 kg N ha\u00031, respec-\ntively), but did not increase in high fungal biomass soil (6.4\u0001 0.9 after N addition vs. 4.5\u0001 0.8 kg N ha\u00031 in\nthe control). Thus, in the high fungal biomass soil more N was immobilized. However, the 15N experiment\ndid not con\ufb01rm these results; N leaching was higher in high fungal biomass soil, even though this soil\nshowed higher immobilization of 15N into microbial biomass. However, only 3% of total 15N was found in\nthemicrobial biomass 2weeks after themineral fertilization.Most of the recovered 15Nwas found inplants\n(approximately 25%) and soil organic matter (approximately 15%), and these amounts did not differ\nbetween the high and the low fungal biomass soil. Our main experiment con\ufb01rmed the assumption of\nlower N losses in a soil with higher fungal biomass. The additional 15N experiment showed that higher\nfungal biomass is probably not the direct cause of higher N retention, but rather the result of low nitrogen\navailability.

Introduction\nFungi and bacteria are themain organisms decomposing organic\nmatter in soils. They each support their own food chain of soil\nfauna, and soil ecosystems are often characterized by having\na fungal-dominated or a bacterial-dominated decomposition\npathway (Wardle et al., 2004a). Fungal-dominated food webs occurEcosystem Ecology, Lancaster\nLA1 4YQ, UK. Tel.: \u00fe44 1524\nries).\nAll rights reserved.in relatively undisturbed, late-successional sites with a high\norganic matter content and low resource quality (Coleman et al.,\n1983). Because of the low nutrient availability in these systems,\nfungi are associated with \u2018slow\u2019 and highly conservative nutrient\ncycling (Van der Heijden et al., 2008; Wardle et al., 2004a). There\nare a number of studies that show that shifts from fungal toward\nbacterial-dominated microbial communities are associated with\nincreased rates of nutrient cycling. For example, Bardgett et al.\n(2006) showed that the presence of the hemiparasite Rhinathus\nminor in grassland lead to a shift in the microbial community\ntoward increasing dominance of bacteria, which was associated\nwith increasing rates of N cycling in soil. Wardle et al. (2004b)\nfound that ecosystem decline was associated with increasing\nF.T. de Vries et al. \/ Soil Biology & Biochemistry 43 (2011) 997e1005998phosphorus limitation, which was paralleled by a shift in the\nmicrobial community toward fungal dominance. Also, De Vries\net al. (2006) found that a higher fungal biomass in soil was asso-\nciated with reduced N leaching in agricultural grasslands, whereas\nGordon et al. (2008) found that, after drying and rewetting, soil\nfrom unimproved grasslands with a high fungal biomass retained\nnutrients better than soil from improved, more bacterial-rich\ngrasslands. Repeated observations of decreasing fungal biomass\nwith intensi\ufb01cation of management have led to the inference that\nfungal dominance is indicative for ecosystems with low N losses\n(Bardgett and McAlister, 1999; De Vries et al., 2007; De Vries et al.,\n2006). However, although this inference is widespread in ecology,\nmost studies mentioned above are correlative. The relationship\nbetween higher fungal biomass and lower N losses has never been\ntested experimentally. With the increasing interest in soil-based\necosystem services and the sustainable management of soils, the\ndemonstration of such a relationship could have implications for\nagricultural management: promoting agricultural soils with higher\nfungal biomass would contribute to reduction of N losses, which are\nknown to cause eutrophication of ground- and surface water as\nwell as global warming and atmospheric pollution (Tilman, 1999).\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to underlie this\nassumed negative relationship between fungal biomass and N los-\nses. First, fungal-dominated food webs have been shown to have\nlower rates of gross N mineralization (H\u00f6gberg et al., 2007). Fungi\nassimilate more carbon per unit substrate decomposed than\nbacteria (Holland and Coleman,1987), although some recent papers\nquestion this idea (Six et al., 2006; Thiet et al., 2006). Carbon (C) and\nN assimilation are coupled stoichiometrically (Hessen et al., 2004),\nbut because of their higher C\/N ratio (VanVeen and Paul,1979), even\nif they are more ef\ufb01cient at assimilating C, fungi need to assimilate\nless N than bacteria. On the other hand, fungi grow on more recal-\ncitrant substrates (with higher C\/N ratios) that contribute less to N\nmineralization, and are able to use them more ef\ufb01ciently than\nbacteria (Hunt et al., 1987). Furthermore, fungi can access spatially\nseparated recalcitrant substrates and inorganic N simultaneously\nwith their extensive hyphal networks and thus immobilize readily\navailable N (Frey et al., 2003;Holland and Coleman,1987). Although,\nin general, fungal-dominated systems are assumed to have higher\nimmobilization of N than bacterial-dominated systems (Schimel\nand Bennett, 2004), experimental con\ufb01rmation is mostly lacking.\nIt has been shown, though, that microbes in extensively managed\ngrasslands, with a (presumed) larger proportion of fungi relative to\nbacteria, immobilize more N than their more intensively managed,\nbacterial-rich, counterparts (Bardgett et al., 1993, 2003). Because\nfungal hyphae are more persistent in the soil than bacterial cells\n(Amelunget al., 2002;Martin andHaider,1979; Solomon et al., 2001,\nbut see De Vries et al., 2009), N captured in fungal hyphae forms\na more stable N pool in the soil and is less easily remineralized than\nN in bacterial cells. Adding to this, because of the higher C\/N ratio of\nfungi coupled with the smaller biomass and lower turnover rates of\nfungal-feeding fauna than their bacterial-feeding counterparts,\ngrazing on fungi releases less N than grazing on bacteria (Chen and\nFerris, 2000; De Ruiter et al., 1993).\nSecond, fungi can increase aggregate formation in the soil by\nentangling soil particles with their hyphae and by excreting extra-\ncellular polysaccharides andproteins that glue together soil particles\n(Ritz and Young, 2004). Especially the abundance of arbuscular\nmycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which (almost) exclusively produce\nglomalin, has been found to be closely correlated with soil aggre-\ngation and carbon sequestration (Wilson et al., 2009). As soil\naggregation protects detritus frommicrobial degradation, increased\naggregation results in lower carbon, and thus N,mineralization rates\n(Rillig et al., 2007). On top of this, it has been suggested that in N rich\nmicro sites, mycorrhizal fungimay be the agents performing the \ufb01rststep in mineralization: the release of dissolved organic N (DON) by\ndepolymerization of organic matter (Schimel and Bennett, 2004).\nA third mechanism concerns another role of AMF. Arbuscular\nmycorrizal fungi can, in addition to their effect on aggregate\nformation, also directly affect N cycling. Although their contribution\nto decomposition is much smaller than that of decomposer fungi\n(Hodge et al., 2001), they can enhance plant uptake of inorganic and\norganic N (Hodge et al., 2001; M\u00e4der et al., 2000). This increased\nplant N uptake could hypothetically reduce leaching losses of N\n(Smith and Read, 1997). However, N addition often suppresses root\nbiomass and percentage of root colonization by AMF (Staddon et al.,\n2004) and, unlike ectomycorrhizal fungi, AMF are thought to play\naminor role inplantNuptake inN rich systems. Still, VanderHeijden\n(2010) showed that microcosms with AMF had slightly lower\nammonium leaching than microcosms without fungi, although\ndifferences were much larger and more signi\ufb01cant for phosphorus\nlosses. In addition, Tu et al. (2006) showed that AMF increased plant\nbiomass 15N of wild oat by 125% and decreased soil inorganic N by\n20%. In addition to increasing plant N uptake, AMF can also take up\nconsiderable amounts of N for their own use. However, in systems\nthat are not limited by N and P, plants reduce their belowground C\nallocation, thus reducing AMF biomass (Johnson, 2010).\nEach of these three mechanisms, or any combination, could\nunderlie the suggested negative correlation between fungal\nbiomass and N losses. However, because a high fungal biomass is\na characteristic of systems with low nutrient availability, it is not\nonly almost impossible, but also not realistic, to disentangle these\nmechanisms from the system that they are inherently linked to.\nTherefore, we used two soils fromone \ufb01eld experiment inwhichwe\nhave monitored fungal and bacterial biomass for years. Although\nthese two soils have hadwidely differing fungal biomass for years as\na result of different inputs of farmyardmanure, other soil properties\nwere very similar. To test whether fungal-dominated soils indeed\nshow lower N losses, and to explore the mechanisms involved, we\nperformed a factorial experiment in which we used these two soils\nwith two levels of fungal biomass and two levels of fertilization.\nThus, we determined N losses from soils with high and low fungal\nbiomass after addition of an equal amount of inorganic fertilizer, as\nwell as fromunfertilized controls. In addition,we did an experiment\nadding labeled N to the same soils, tracing 15N in leachates, soil,\nplants and microbial biomass.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Sampling and experimental design\nWe collected soil samples from two grasseclover plots differing\nin fungal biomass from an experimental \ufb01eld trial at Heino, the\nNetherlands (52\u0004250 north and 6\u0004150 east). The trial was established\nin 2001 and the humid sandy soil was classi\ufb01ed as a gleyey sand\nwith a semi-permeable loam horizon at 70e80 cm (for a detailed\ndescription of the\ufb01eld trial seeDeVries et al. (2006)). The difference\nin fungal biomass between the two soils resulted from a long-term\n(six year) difference in fertilization rate (40 vs. 80 kg N ha\u00031 y\u00031 as\nfarm yard manure) (De Vries et al., 2006). Both soils received\nadditional P and K fertilization as P2O5 (107 kg ha\u00031 y\u00031) and K2O\n(372 kg ha\u00031 y\u00031). Soil properties other than fungal and bacterial\nbiomass, including concentrations of mineral N, did not differ\nsigni\ufb01cantly (Table 1). Differences in fungal biomass between the\ntwo soils were up to a factor two and had been consistent for more\nthan\ufb01veyears (Fig.1); both levels of fungal biomasswerewithin the\nrange commonly found in Dutch agricultural grasslands (De Vries\net al., 2007). In an earlier (pilot) experiment, we found that after\nthe addition of NH4NO3 (equivalent to 30 kg N ha\u00031) the two soils\ndiffered in their N leaching (Fig. 2).\n0  \n0.5 \n1 \n1.5 \n2 \n2.5 \n3 \n3.5 \n4 \n1 7  16 22 29 \nDa y s  \nLow F  fe rt .  \nHi gh F  fe rt .  \nN\n-m\nin\n le\nac\nhe\nd \n(m\ng \nm\n-2\n)\nFig. 2.

Main experiment\nIn November 2007, 48 intact soil columns (12 cm diam., 30 cm\ndepth) with herbage were collected from both \ufb01elds and incubated\nin the greenhouse for 4 weeks (20 \u0004C, 16 h daylight). After clipping\nthe herbage and covering the bottom of the columns with a 1 mm\nnylon mesh, half of the columns received fertilizer as NH4NO3\nsolution (34 mg N, equivalent to 30 kg N ha\u00031). At the start of the\nexperiment, each treatment had 12 replicates. Columns were\narranged in a factorial randomized complete block design and\nplaced on top of a container to allow for the collection of leachates.\nAfter 3 and 29 days of incubation, three columns of each treatment\ncombination were harvested to determine actual denitri\ufb01cation\n(see below). All columns were watered weekly (350 ml, equivalent\nto 30 mm rainfall) with demineralized water for 4 weeks, and N\nleaching and N2O emissions were measured at regular intervals. At\nthe end of the 4-week experiment, the six remaining columns of\neach treatment were harvested destructively and analyzed for\nfungal and bacterial biomass and N pools.\n2.1.2. 15N experiment\nIn March 2008, we took an additional 12 columns (6 from each\nplot) to determine the fate of added fertilizer N.

Fungal and bacterial biomass\nMicroscopic slideswere prepared as described by Bloem andVos\n(2004). Slides for counting fungi were stained with Differential\nFluorescent Stain (DFS) solution (3.5 g L\u00031 europium chelate (Kodak\ncat no. 1305515, Eastman Fine Chemicals, Rochester NY, USA) and\n50 mg L\u00031 \ufb02uorescent brightener, C40H42N120O10S2 Na2 (FW 960.9,\nFluostain I, cat no.

Total hyphal lengthwas\ncalculated using the grid intersection method (Bloem et al., 1995).\nBiovolumewas calculated using the equation V\u00bc (p\/4)W2(L\u0003W\/3),\nwhere W \u00bc width (mm) and L \u00bc length (mm). Fungal biomass was\ncalculated assuming a mean hyphal diameter (width) of 2.5 mm and\na speci\ufb01c carbon content of 1.3\u000510\u000313 g C mm\u00033 (Bakken and Olsen,\n1983; Van Veen and Paul, 1979).\nMicroscopic slides for determination of bacterial numbers were\nprepared in the same way as slides for fungal counting, except that\nbacterial slides were stained with the \ufb02uorescent protein dye\n5-(4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl) amino\ufb02uorescein. Bacterial numbers,\ncell volumes and number of dividing cells were measured auto-\nmatically with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS\nSP2) combined with image analysis software (Leica Qwin Pro) as\ndescribed by Bloem et al.

Subsequently, the sievewasmoved in an up-\nand-downmotion 50 timeswithin 2min, afterwhich the>2000 mm\naggregates were backwashed, oven dried at 50 \u0004C until no water\nremained, and weighed. Soil and water that passed the sieve were\ntransferred onto the next sieve with a \ufb01ner mesh. This procedure\nwas repeated with a 250 mm and a 53 mm sieve to yield aggregate\nfractions of >2000 mm, 250e2000 mm, 53e250 mm, and <53 mm.\n2.4. N losses and pools\nLeachates were collected one day after irrigation and colori-\nmetrically analyzed for NO3\u0003 and NH4\u00fe. After oxidation with K2S2O8,\ntotal soluble N was analyzed and dissolved organic N (DON) was\ncalculated by subtracting the amount of inorganic N from total\nsoluble N. Total amounts of NO3\u0003, NH4\u00fe and DON leached per column\nwere calculated by multiplying concentrations with volumes of\nleachates.\nDuring the \ufb01rst week, N2O emissions were measured daily,\nwhile from the second week on, N2O emissions were measured\nthree times a week. Columns were closed with an air-tight PVC lid.\nAfter 30 min, N2O concentrations in the headspace of the columns\nwere measured with a photo-acoustic infra-red gas analyzer\n(Innova1312). The gas analyzer was equipped with \ufb01lters to mini-\nmize interference by CO2 (a soda-lime scrubbing \ufb01lter), and N2O\nconcentrations were internally corrected for measured CO2\nconcentrations and water vapor. The assumption of linear increase\nduring themeasurement period under our experimental conditions\nwas checked several times.\nActual denitri\ufb01cation at the start and at the end of the incuba-\ntion was measured by acetylene inhibition (Robertson and Tiedje,\n1987). Brie\ufb02y, intact soil columns were divided into three equal\nparts of 10 cm height, and put into air-tight containers (7.5 L) after\nwhich acetylene was added to a 5% concentration (v\/v). Twenty-\nfour and 48 h after acetylene addition, N2O concentrations in\ncontainers were measured with a photo-acoustic infra-red gas\nmonitor as described above. We calculated cumulative denitri\ufb01-\ncation as follows: we calculated N2O\/N2 ratios for each of the four\ntreatments separately, using N2O production rates and actual\ndenitri\ufb01cation rates on the same day at the start and at the end of\nthe experiment. We assumed that for each treatment, these N2O\/N2\nratios changed linearly over the course of the experiment. Thus, for\neach treatment, we interpolated these N2O\/N2 ratios, resulting in\na linear function that predicted N2O\/N2 ratios at every date we\nmeasured N2O production. We then used those ratios combined\nwith actual N2O measurements to calculate total denitri\ufb01cation at\neach sampling date, which we then used to calculate cumulative\ndenitri\ufb01cation.\nMicrobial biomass N and 15N were determined using the fumi-\ngation-extraction method (Brookes et al., 1985). Brie\ufb02y, 5 g of soil\nwas fumigated with CHCl3 for 24 h at 20 \u0004C. After removal of CHCl3,\nsoluble N was extracted from fumigated and unfumigated samples\nwith 0.5 M K2SO4 for 30 min on an orbital shaker. DON in the\nextracts was converted to NH4\u00fe and NO3\u0003 by persulfate digestion,\nand the microbial N \ufb02ush was converted to microbial biomass N\nusing a kEN factor of 0.55 (Brookes et al., 1985). In the second\nexperiment, after persulphate digestion, microbial biomass 15Nwas\ndetermined by diffusing ammonium and nitrate onto an acid\ntreated \ufb01lter wrapped in te\ufb02on tape. The sample was subsequently\nanalyzed for 15N enrichment on an isotope ratio mass spectrometer\n(ANCA-IRMS, Europa Scienti\ufb01c Integra, UK) interfaced with a CN\nsample converter at the UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility, with\natmospheric N2 as a standard (0.3663% atomic excess).\nHerbage was clipped and removed from the columns at weekly\nintervals during the 4-week incubation. Total plant herbage wasdried at 70 \u0004C, weighed, milled, and analyzed for total N and 15N\ncontent using a C\/N analyzer as described above. In the 15N\nexperiment, in addition to above ground plant material, roots were\nwashed, dried, milled and analyzed for total and 15N content.\nTotal N content in the aggregate-size fractions obtained by wet-\nsieving were also analyzed using a C\/N analyzer. Soil inorganic N\nwas extracted by 1 M KCl and measured using Skalar segmented\n\ufb02ow analysis (Breda, the Netherlands). Soil organic matter N was\ncalculated as total N minus inorganic N and microbial N.\n2.5. Statistical analysis\nAll data were checked for normality and homogeneity of vari-\nance, and log-transformed if necessary. Outliers were determined\nusing Cook\u2019s distance and deleted if there were a priori reasons to\ndo sodthis was the case for one sample from the fertilized, high\nfungal biomass treatment. Main and interaction effects of fungal\nbiomass and fertilizer addition were assessed by two-way analysis\nof variance, with the exception of N leaching and N2O \ufb02uxes, which\nwere assessed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA. All statis-\ntical tests were done using the statistical package SPSS (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL).\n3. Results\n3.1. Fungal and bacterial biomass in main experiment\nFungal biomass increased in all treatments during incubation\n(Fig. 3A). The increase was highest in the high fungal biomass soil\n(F1,19 \u00bc 56.29, P < 0.001), and was reduced by fertilization\n(F1,19\u00bc 36.93, P< 0.001). The negative effect of fertilization on fungal\ngrowth was stronger in the high fungal biomass soil than in the low\nfungal biomass soil (fungal biomass \u0005 fertilization interaction\nF1,19 \u00bc 8.81, P \u00bc 0.008), which resulted in convergence of fungal\nbiomass in the unfertilized low fungal biomass soil and the fertilized\nhigh fungal biomass soil (Fig. 3A). Contrastingly, bacterial biomass\ndecreased during incubation (Fig. 3B). Bacterial biomass did not\ndiffer signi\ufb01cantly between the low and high fungal biomass soil at\nthe start of the experiment, nor after 4 weeks of incubation. Fertil-\nization differentially affected bacterial biomass in the low and in the\nhigh fungal biomass soil (fungal biomass \u0005 fertilization interaction\nF1,19 \u00bc 4.79, P \u00bc 0.041). The change in fungal\/bacterial biomass ratio\n(F\/B ratio; data not shown) was largely driven by changes in fungal\nbiomass. The F\/B ratio was highest in the high fungal biomass\nsoil (F1,19 \u00bc 16.08, P \u00bc 0.001), was reduced by fertilization\n(F1,19\u00bc 9.17, P\u00bc 0.007), and the negative effect of fertilization on the\nF\/B ratio was greatest in the high fungal biomass soil (fungal\nbiomass \u0005 fertilization interaction F1,19 \u00bc 7.63, P \u00bc 0.012).\n3.2.

Fertilizer addition increased\nN2O emission (F1,30 \u00bc 5.60, P \u00bc 0.025) (Fig. 4A, Table 2) and deni-\ntri\ufb01cation (F1,31 \u00bc 21.56, P < 0.001, Table 2) in both soils. We found\na negative relationship between fungal biomass and N2O emission\nin the unfertilized treatments, but not in the fertilized treatments\n(Fig. 5A). Over the whole experimental period, N2O emissions were\npositively correlated to leachate NO3\u0003 concentrations (R2 \u00bc 0.147,\nP < 0.001).\nThe addition of fertilizer had a differential effect on mineral N\nleaching in the low and high fungal biomass soil (fungal\nbiomass\u0005 fertilization interaction F1,31\u00bc11.47, P\u00bc 0.002).

Leaching of 15N was 4-fold higher.\nMicrobial biomass N was 19% higher in the high fungal biomass\nsoil, while 15N immobilized in this pool was twice as high in the\nhigh fungal biomass soil. However, the amounts of 15N immobilized\nwere small relative to the amounts found in plants and soil organic\nmatter (Table 3). Thus, microbial biomass was not a major sink of\n15N. 15N recovery in microbial biomass was 2.9%, vs. 22.5 and 16.3%\nin the plants and the soil organic matter, respectively, in the high\nfungal biomass soil. In this soil, due to much lower root biomass N,\ntotal plant N was much lower (171 vs. 269 kg N ha\u00031) but the 15N\npercentage tended to be higher. The result was a lower 15N\nimmobilization in the plants in the high fungal biomass soil (6.8 vs.\n7.4 kg 15N ha\u00031). Total 15N recovery was considerably higher in the\nhigh fungal biomass soil (59 vs. 45%). This suggests that in the low\nfungal biomass soil, which showed lower N leaching, more 15N was\nlost by denitri\ufb01cation (which was not measured in the additional\nexperiment).

Discussion\nOur main experiment, and our pilot experiment, showed that N\nlosses were lower in the soil characterized by a higher fungal\nbiomass. The key \ufb01nding of the main experiment is that the addi-\ntion of inorganic N did not increase N leaching in the high fungal\nbiomass soil, whilst in the low fungal biomass soil N leaching\nincreased threefold compared to the unfertilized control (Fig. 4A).\nN2O emission and total denitri\ufb01cation were lower in the high\nfungal biomass soil irrespective of the addition of inorganic N\n(Fig. 4B). However, when we did an additional experiment using\n15N to unravel the mechanism behind these lower N losses in the\nhigh fungal biomass soil, we found contrasting results: N leaching\ntended to be higher in the high fungal biomass soil.\nIn the introduction we listed three potential mechanisms which\nmight explain the negative relationship between fungal biomass\nand N losses: fungal-dominated soils could have (1) lower gross N\nmineralization and higher immobilization of inorganic N into\nmicrobial biomass; (2) increased protection of organic matter\nbecause of increased aggregate formation, and (3) increased plant N\nuptake through arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

This leaves mechanisms (1) and (3)\nto be considered.\nSome of our observations support mechanism (1). The lower\nN2O emission (Fig. 4A) and total denitri\ufb01cation (Table 2) in the high\nfungal biomass soil, both with and without fertilizer addition,\nmight be explained by a lower NO3\u0003 availability in the high fungal\nbiomass soil due to lower gross N mineralization. This would also\nexplain lower NO3\u0003 leaching (Fig. 4B). There was a negative rela-\ntionship between fungal biomass and N2O production in the\nunfertilized treatments, which is in sharp contrast with \ufb01ndings of\nfungi dominating denitri\ufb01cation (Crenshaw et al., 2008; Laughlin\nand Stevens, 2002; McLain and Martens, 2006). However, this\nnegative relationship between fungal biomass and N2O production\nwas blurred after fertilizer addition (Fig. 5A). This shows that NO3\u0003\navailability was a larger control on N2O emissions than microbial\ncommunity composition (Cavigelli and Robertson, 2000). Although\nwe did notmeasure denitri\ufb01cation in the 15N experiment, we found\na lower recovery of 15N in the low fungal biomass soil than in the\nhigh fungal biomass soil (45 vs. 59%, respectively), which indicates\nhigher denitri\ufb01cation in the low fungal biomass soil. Recovery of\n15N was low in both low and high fungal biomass soil, indicating\nhigh N losses through denitri\ufb01cation in this experiment. A possible\nexplanation for high denitri\ufb01cation rates might be that columns\nwere collected at the end of the winter when the soil was partly\nfrozen. This resulted in high moisture content and slow water\nin\ufb01ltration rates during the two-week experiment, probably\ncreating anaerobic conditions favoring denitri\ufb01cation.\nThe addition of mineral fertilizer in the main experiment had\na differential effect on mineral N leaching in the low and high\nfungal biomass soil: in the high fungal biomass soil, fertilization did\nnot increase leaching of mineral N, whereas in the low fungal\nbiomass soil, leaching increased more than threefold (Fig. 4B). This\nsuggests that added N was either immobilized into microbial bio-\nmassdwhich was supported by the negative relationship between\nmineral N leaching and fungal biomass in the fertilized treatments\n(Fig. 5B)dor taken up by plants in the high fungal biomass soil.\nThere was no relationship between microbial biomass N and N\nleaching however, nor was microbial biomass N affected by fertil-\nization (Table 2). In the main experiment, the amount of mineral N\nadded (30 kg N ha\u00031) and the amounts of total N lost were small\ncompared to the amount of N in microbial biomass (over\n200 kg N ha\u00031). Therefore immobilization in microbial biomass was\nhard to measure. Shoot N uptake equaled 30 kg N ha\u00031 but was the\nsame in all treatments and could not explain the difference in N loss\nbetween the low and high fungal biomass soil.In contrast to both the pilot and the main experiment, lower N\nleaching was found in the low fungal biomass soil after addition of\nmineral N in the 15N experiment (Table 3). In fact, mineral N\nleached in the high fungal biomass soil was similar to that in the\nmain experiment (6 kg N ha\u00031) whereas mineral N leaching in\nthe low fungal biomass soil was lower than in the main experiment\n(2 vs. 8 kg N ha\u00031 in 2 weeks) (Fig. 4B and Table 3). Although\na 2-fold higher immobilization of 15N into microbial biomass was\nfound in the high fungal biomass soil, only 3% of total 15Nwas found\nin themicrobial biomass 2 weeks after adding N. Microbial biomass\nhas been shown to be a signi\ufb01cant short-term sink for added N,\nbut the peak of immobilization occurs within days after N addition\n(Bardgett et al., 2003; Dunn et al., 2006; and reviewed by Kaye and\nHart, 1997; Recous et al., 1990). Since wemeasured twoweeks after\nN addition, the N immobilized in microbial biomass might have\nbeen remineralized and incorporated into other soil N pools. In any\ncase, our addition experiment did not support microbial N immo-\nbilization as an important mechanism for lower N losses. Also, the\nmechanism of improved plant N uptake through AMF (mechanism\n3) is not supported by the results of the additional experiment\nbecause there was no improved plant N uptake in the high fungal\nbiomass soil. Due to the lower root biomass, even less 15N was\nrecovered in plant material in the high fungal biomass soil (6.8 vs.\n7.5 kg 15N ha\u00031). In addition, the role of AMF was probably limited\nbecause both soils received farm yard manure and additional P and\nK fertilizer.\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancies between the\nresults fromourmain andpilot experiment on the one hand, and the\n15N experiment on the other hand, might be the different experi-\nmental conditions due to different \ufb01eld sampling times (end of\nautumn in main and pilot experiment, vs. end of winter in 15N\nexperiment). Biomass of fungi and bacteria generally increases\ntoward autumn, and declines toward the end of winter (Zwart et al.,\n1994), which is supported by the lower biomass of fungi and\nbacteria in the 15N experiment. Moreover, fungal biomass has been\nshown to remain low well into spring, whereas bacterial biomass\nhas been shown to increase again in February (Bloem et al., 1994;\nZwart et al., 1994). Thus, presumably, fungi (including AMF) would\nhave been relatively more active in our main and pilot experiment\nthan in our 15N experiment, whereas bacterial activity would have\nbeenmore important in the 15N experiment. In addition, the shorter\ndurationmight have prevented fungi to growand exert an in\ufb02uence\non N cycling to the same extent as in the main experiment.\nIn the main experiment, fungal biomass increased during the\nincubation,whereasbacterial biomass decreased (Fig. 3). Apparently,\nF.T. de Vries et al. \/ Soil Biology & Biochemistry 43 (2011) 997e10051004conditions were in favor of fungi, supporting our (in the previous\nparagraph) proposed idea that fungi were relatively in\ufb02uential in\nthe main experiment. Fertilizer addition caused fungal biomass in\nthe high fungal biomass soil to converge with fungal biomass in the\nunfertilized low fungal biomass soil (Fig. 3A). So, although differ-\nences in fungal biomass between the two soils had been consistent\nfor 5 years in the \ufb01eld (Fig. 1), these differences were neutralized\nwithin 4 weeks after a modest (30 kg N ha\u00031) mineral fertilizer\naddition. Negative effects of inorganic N on fungi have been mostly\nattributed to changes in vegetation and organic matter characteris-\ntics (Bardgett et al.,1999; Donnison et al., 2000). Because of the short\ntime course of the negative effect on fungal growth of inorganic N\naddition in this experiment, our results rather suggest a direct\nnegative effect on fungal growth. It is not clear why inorganic N\nwould have such an effect on fungal growth. It has been suggested\nthat inorganic N represses enzyme activity (Fog, 1988).\nN addition increased neither plant biomass nor fungal and\nbacterial biomass, which indicates that our grassland soils were not\nN limited. Still, in the main experiment, N retention was higher in\nthe high fungal biomass soil than in the low fungal biomass soil.\nEven though the two soils did not differ in most parameters rele-\nvant for N cycling, the lower farm yard manure inputs of the high\nfungal biomass soil inevitably will have changed organic matter\nquality, reduced N availability and thus selected for a more fungal-\ndominated microbial community. This fungal-dominated microbial\ncommunity might in turn have reduced N availability further\n(Wardle et al., 2004a). In addition, physical properties might have\naffected leaching rates, although we found no differences in\naggregate-size distribution, bulk densities, and volumes leached.\nThus, we propose that the lower manure inputs of the high fungal\nbiomass soil have created a set of ecosystem properties that retain\nN better. Summarized, our results show that higher fungal biomass\nis probably not the direct cause of higher N retention, but rather an\nindication of low nitrogen availability.\nIn conclusion, we are offering a \ufb01rst attempt to answer the key\nquestion whether fungal-dominated systems have lower N losses.\nOur results con\ufb01rm that a higher fungal biomass can be considered\nas an indicator of higher nutrient retention in soils. In our grassland\nsoils the higher nitrogen retentionwas probably the result of lower\nfarm yard manure inputs (40 vs. 80 kg N ha\u00031 yr\u00031) in the past six\nyears. Interestingly, in our soils with grass-clover, above ground\nproduction was maintained, not only in our 4-week experiment\n(Table 2, plant N uptake), but also in the \ufb01eld (De Vries et al., 2006).\nThe clover in the sward may have compensated for the reduced\nfertilization; it is well documented that N \ufb01xation by legumes\ndecreases with increasing N fertilization (Carlsson and Huss-Danell,\n2003). Thus, increased nutrient retention does not necessarily\nresult in lower crop production.\nMore research is needed to understand why soils with a higher\nfungal biomass can reduce N losses. If this is a general phenomenon\nas has beenwidely assumed so far, testing the relationship between\nfungal biomass and N losses on longer timescales, and across more\npairs of soils or across a gradient of soils varying in fungal biomass\nwould be a way forward. In addition, more mechanistic studies\nusing sterilized soils reinoculated with different microbial\ncommunities might provide more insight in the mechanisms\ninvolved.\nAcknowledgments\nThanks to An Vos, Meint Veninga, Willem Menkveld, Iker del\nRio, Eduard Hummelink, Tam\u00e0s Salanki, Jaap Nelemans, Willeke\nvan Tintelen and Dorien Kool for help in the \ufb01eld and in the lab.\nNick van Eekeren kindly allowed us to sample the Aver Heino\nexperiment.We thank Richard Bardgett, Lijbert Brussaard,Wimvander Putten, and Peter de Ruiter for commenting on a previous\nversion of this manuscript, and Matthew Bowker for his refreshing\ncomments in the role of reviewer.
