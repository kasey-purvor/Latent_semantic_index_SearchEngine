Today\u2018s competitive environment \n 2\nrequires that industries try to sustain full production capabilities, while minimizing \ncapital investment. From the maintenances perspective, this involves maximizing \nequipment reliability (i.e. uptime) including prolonging the equipment\u2019s life. Wise \noperation and careful maintenance should together deliver cost-effective production \nreliability and this should be the basis for shrewd management decision-making. \nUnfortunately many industries have been slow to implement PM initiatives. For instance, \nin Nigeria:- \n\u0083 ~80 percent of maintenance costs are spent on facilities with a mean time between \nfailures of 30 days or less \n\u0083 30 to 40 percent of PM costs are spent on assets with negligible failure track-\nrecords, i.e. incorrect priorities are chosen and implemented. \n \nOverall, the goal for an organization is to increase profitability. The maintenance and \nasset-management function can increase profits in two main ways, i.e. by decreasing \nrunning costs and increasing capability. If the annual maintenance cost exceeds 5 percent \nof the asset value, the organization is probably in financial difficulties. The total \nmaintenance cost depends on the quality of the equipment, the way it is used, the \nmaintenance policy and the business strategy. The wise business owner buys equipment \nthat will subsequently need little maintenance, i.e. is highly unlikely to fail [2].  \n \nBy automatically monitoring multi-functional printers (displaying the behaviour \nparameters of the components being assessed), eMaintenance programs can continually \ntrack the performance of each component. eMaintenance can provide a customised \nsolution and implement the corresponding preventive process, which can be tailored to \nsatisfy the individual needs, by providing highly-accurate \u2018prior\u2019 information, as and \nwhen required, about the performance (i.e. degradation) of each component. With this \ninformation, maintenance costs can be reduced, and the production process become more \neffective. \n \nMaintenance \n \nThis should preserve components so that they fulfil their function(s). However continuing \noperation depends on designers of the equipment, as well as its constructors and its \noperators, i.e. not just the maintainers. \nDeveloping and executing a maintenance strategy consist of three steps: \n\u0083 formulate a plan of what needs to be done for each component.(i.e. work \nidentification); \n\u0083 acquire the resources ( skilled personnel, spares and tools) needed to executive the \nproposed procedure effectively \n\u0083 implement the strategy (i.e. acquire and deploy the systems needed to manage the \nresources effectively) [3]. \nTo increase the equipment\u2019s uptime, at least cost, is the aim. A proactive profit-focused \napproach is needed to narrow the gap between actual costs and ideal costs. Downtime \nseriously bedevils the productive capability of Nigerian industries, so reducing average \nrate of output, increasing operating costs and interfering with customer service. \nDowntime can so easily increase as a result of the ineffective implementation of just-in-\n 3\ntime (JIT) and lean total-quality management (TQM) procedures. Hence, the applications \nof total productive maintenance (TPM) and reliability-centred maintenance (RCM) as \ncompany-wide improvement processes are highly desirable. TPM requires operators and \nmaintainers to work together as a team in order to reduce waste, minimize downtime, \nenhance product-quality, and improve equipment effectiveness. \n \nRCM involves determining what must be done to ensure that any physical component \ncontinues to perform in the way that its user wants it to do [3]. Two objectives, must be \nmet:- (i) determine the maintenance requirements, and then (ii) ensure that they are met \nas cheaply as possible. RCM relies on using pertinent skills, regarding the operation and \nmaintenance of a piece of equipment, through a small multi-disciplinary team. Several \nroot-cause analysis (RCA) techniques have prompted the use of such teams to solve and \neliminate one-off, catastrophic and chronic failures. The secret of success is to ensure that \nall involved personnel are properly trained in these techniques, then to establish the \norganizational disciplines and procedures that ensure that they are used whenever an \nappropriate situation arises. It is vital that ownership of the problem is accepted by all \ninvolved. Lezlo [4] pointed out that managing people consists of more than controlling \ntheir activities: effective management requires appropriate leadership with clear vision \nand mission, and must make available the funds necessary for implementation of the \nmutually-agreed programme. The evolutions of TQM, lean management and JIT, brought \nabout TPM. Unfortunately these concepts have not been widely embraced, as yet, in \nNigeria. In order to achieve success, the basic principle of a quality-maintenance \nprogramme must permeate the entire organization. A factual numerate approach to \ndecision making, respect for other personnel, encouragement of innovation and emphasis \non continual improvement rather than focusing on blame when mistakes arise are what is \nneeded, i.e. these are signs of a learning organization. \n \nThe Maintenance Challenge \n \nBusiness leaders increasingly realise the strategic importance of the maintenance function \nfor organizations, which have significant investments in physical assets, and so is a \nnecessary expense in the operating budget. In order words, reliability has become a \ncritical issue in capital-intensive operations. \n \nUnfortunately, in many Nigerian industries, effective maintenance is usually not a high \npriority and the consequent cost of failures, as a percentage of the total cost, keeps rising. \nBusinesses today need innovation, to break the inherent moulds of perception and \nredundant patterns of behaviour [5]. Organizations should be changing from a repair-\nfocused to reliability-focused culture. Hence the set goals must provide \u201csomething in it \nfor us\u201d for all within the organization, thereby \u201cbuilding-in\u201d commitment. So the leader \nshould formulate these goals with reference to the needs of those working within the \norganization, and use the goal to shape the future of that organization [1]. Individual \nrewards must be aligned with the achievement of the company\u2019s strategic goals. These \nrewards can be both financial and non-financial: the most successful change-initiatives \nincorporate a blend of the two. The leader must create opportunities for teamwork and \norganizational learning. The challenge facing Nigerian maintenance mangers today is not \n 4\nsolely to find the appropriate methodologies to apply, but in understanding how they fit \ntogether. It also lies in making sure that the application of this approach is not regarded as \nthe latest fad or \u201cflavour of the month\u201d, but is fully adopted and internalized within the \norganisation and simply becomes \u201cthe way we do things around here\u201d. If wise leadership \nemanates from the top of the organisation, then the speed of cultural change will be much \ngreater and far wider ranging. \n \nA vision statement should describe what the organization aspires to, whereas the resulting \nmission statement should explain how the vision is to be achieved. The vision statement \nfor maintenance should be governed by current best-practice (CBP) as the benchmark. \nPM is usually based on an old-fashioned premise, namely fixed-time maintenance (FTM) \noverhaul or even replacement of components. This approach is seldom justifiable, \nbecause less than 20 percent of all components fail within the usually prescribed periods, \nand hence the relatively high costs incurred as a result of implementing PM. Thus, if \nadopted, PM activities should be primarily individual component-condition based, and \nimplemented via a more wisely-scheduled corrective maintenance procedure. \n \nBy a comparison of USA and Nigerian industries, it is concluded that more than one-third \nof all maintenance expenditures in the latter are wasted through ineffective utilization of \nmaintenance resources. \n \nPreventive Maintenance Contribution to Profitability \n \nAn important criterion for investment in a company is the financial return on its fixed \nassets (ROFA). Asset management focuses on achieving the lowest total life-cycle cost to \nproduce the required product or provide a sought-after service. The goal is to achieve a \nhigher ROFA than ones competitors in order to be the lower-cost producer of a product \nor service. The maintenance management impacts on the ROFA because maintenance \ncosts are a significant contributor to manufacturing costs. If the maintenance cost as a \npercentage of manufacturing cost fluctuates, then the effectiveness of maintenance should \nbe examined to find the cause of the variation. \n \nDowntime increases the industry\u2019s financial expenditure because of the costs of: \n\u0083 idle production\/operations personnel \n\u0083 late deliveries \n\u0083 overtime to make up for lost production in order to meet promised deliveries on \ntime \n\u0083 lost sales as a result of products not being made on time. \n \nHowever Japanese studies relating to TPM have concluded that \u201cinefficiency\u201d losses tend \nto exceed downtime losses. In Nigerian industries, most inefficiency losses are never \nmeasured and reported. Also, many chronic problems, that have a dramatic impact on \nequipment effectiveness, are never even comprehended. Only if accurate maintenance \nrecords are kept are these problems realised. Then, utilizing the maintenance data, \ncombined with pertinent financial data, a worthwhile estimate of the resulting costs can \nbe achieved. As maintenance is regarded as an expense, any maintenance saving will \n 5\ncontribute directly to the profit achieved. As the effectiveness of maintenance improves \nand downtime is reduced, there is less need for investment in standby (but otherwise) \nredundant plant. This will contribute to an overall rise in the ROFA for any organization. \n \nCost of Maintenance \n \n In the chemical industry, the world\u2019s best-performance maintenance processes annually \ncost 1.8 to 2.0 percent of the current replacement value of the plant. In poorly-managed \noperations, maintenance costs per year exceed 5 percent of asset-replacement value, i.e. a \nwastage of $30,000 yearly is typical for every M$ 1 of asset value. The effect of \ncompounding the maintenance cost, taken as $ 30,000 annually, over a twenty-year life at \nthe business average annual rate of 12 percent for the sake of calculation, then the lost \nopportunity cost would be $2,162,000 because of (i) poorly designed-or-built equipment \nand (ii) ineffective operating and maintenance practices. In the example cited, for each 1 \npercent of replacement asset value spent annually on maintenance over a 20-year period, \n$ 75,000 of every $1M of the original capital invested will not lead to any financial \nreturn. The lost-opportunity cost will then be assessed - see Table 1 [2]. \n \n Table 1: Features that should be taken into account when evaluating the lost-\nopportunity \n  \nAnnual \nmaintenance \ncost as % of \nasset \nreplacement \nvalue \nCurrent \nreplacement \nvalue of \nassertion ($) \nLength of \nasset life \n(years) \nWeighted \naverage cost of \ncapital (%)  \nAccumulated \nvalue of 20 \nyears \nmaintenance \nopportunity- \ncost at the \naverage cost of \ncapital rate \nPresent value of \ncapital. Year of \nmaintenance \nopportunity cost as a \nweighted-average \ncost of capital \nwithout inflation. \n \n \nIn recent years, some Nigerian industries have gradually shown increasing concerns \nabout (i) higher maintenance costs and (ii) maintenance productivity. Maintenance is \noften the largest single management expenditure in Nigerian plants: in many industries, it \nexceeds the annual net profit. Although strategies such as PM and PDM have produced \nsavings of up to 25 percent, some studies have suggested that more than one-third of \nmaintenance costs can be saved without decreasing uptime. Therefore, it is important for \norganisations to maximize their maintenance effectiveness and thereby their equipment \nuptime. In Nigeria, most maintenance departments showed productivities of around \n25\u219235 percent of ideal productivity. However, wiser planning and scheduling of \nmaintenance activities could significantly improve on this. The objectives should be to: \n\u0083 Increase the effectiveness\/efficiencies of plant\/equipment. \n\u0083 Boost the profit achieved  \n\u0083 Reduce maintenance and operating costs. \n\u0083 Improve availability and reliability \n\u0083 Raise the financial return on asset investment \n\u0083 Introduce an inspiring corporate culture amongst maintenance personnel  \n\u0083 Implement a continual-improvement paradigm \n 6\nThe overall aim is to maximize the value achieved by maintenance investments, i.e. profit \noptimization with maintenance excellence. \n \nScope \n \nLean manufacturing and optimal maintenance require the identification and elimination \nof waste through continual improvement. Over-maintaining of an asset squanders \nprecious resources. Nigerian industries have been conservative in setting PM intervals. \nBoth excessive frequency of maintenance or under maintenance increase downtime, and \nso reduce production output. Maintenance personnel should adopt a proactive focused-\napproach to narrow the gap between manufacturing actual costs and what could be \nachieved by reducing waste and inefficiencies. A profit-focused approach to maintenance \nhas its roots in TPM [6]. \n \nThe way maintenance is performed will influence the availability of plant as well as the \nsafety of its operation. These, in turn, will determine the profitability of the enterprise [7]. \nMaintenance usually remains one of the few business sectors via which significant \nincreases in company profits can be achieved [8]. The common problems include (i) its \nhigh cost; (ii) underutilization of plant and equipment; (iii) it being poorly valued in \nhouse and so not an exploited opportunity for competitive advantage; and (iv) too often it \nis undertaken by insufficiently skilled operatives. \n \nMaintenance in Nigeria can account for up to 40% of total production costs. The effect of \npoor maintenance can result in less production, poorer quality end-products and customer \ndissatisfaction. Part of the solution to the besetting problems in maintenance is not \ntechnical: rather a more business-based approach to maintenance is needed resulting from \na top-management commitment. In a poorly-run company, the maintenance manger can \ncontrol up to 40 percent of production costs and this has a direct effect on profitability.  \n \nA cost and cash-flow budget needs to be drawn up with normal forecasting formats, \nwhich, in conjunction with other pertinent documents, will form a maintenance business-\nplan. In this way, maintenance concern will be embodied in the management-decision \nprocess [8]. \n \nCulture \nA dictionary definition of culture is \u201cthe total of the inherent ideals, beliefs, values and \nknowledge, which constitute the shared basis for social action\u201d. Continual business \nchange is inevitable in a global economy. A successful business environment should \nreflect the way people live. Thus it is desirable, within the industry, to provide an \nenvironment and a culture which contribute to the welfare of all personnel. Considering \nstaff as individuals, rather than as a generic workforce, is seen by enlightened companies \nas a prerequisite to achieving a positive company culture. Desirable human motivations, \nattitudes and behaviour are determined by a culture based on addressing human needs. \nSuch a culture is therefore an aid to management in efforts to make their personnel \n\u201ccreators and wise doers\u201d rather than parasitic \u201cdone-fors\u201d [9]. The factors (see ISO \n9001: 2000) that significantly contribute to a high-quality culture in an industry, are:- \n 7\n\u0083 Top-management involvement \n\u0083 Customer focus \n\u0083 Wise management of human relations (HRs) \n\u0083 Providing an inspiring management and work environment  \n\u0083 Measurement, analysis and improvement of all activities \n\u0083 360o loyalty \nSuccess in business is not determined by the executives\u2019 skills alone, or by the visible \nfeatures, the strategy, the structure and the reward system of the organization. Rather \neach organization has an espirit de corps, a certain style, a character, a way of doing \nthings that influences new entrants as well as existing personnel. The pervading corporate \nculture provides the social benchmarks that inspire or fail to drive successfully the \norganization: much of what goes on in an organization is guided by the cultural quality of \nshared meaning, hidden assumptions, and unwritten rules [10]. \u201c There are no rules here, \nbut if you break one of them, you\u2019ve had it\u201d in the words of a famous manager \u2013 Giles \nAlington. \n \nOrganization culture is defined as the personality of a company! It represents a set of \ncommon perceptions such as: norms, guiding beliefs, values, customs and modes of \nbehaviour [11, 12]. Although corporate culture is usually classified under headings such \nas degree of empowerment, tasks undertaken or personnel responsible [13], it is common \nfor sub-cultures to exist within individual departments, groups or teams. Hofstede [14] \ndefined these as (i) the \u201cboss\u201d distance, (ii) uncertainty avoidance and (iii) individualism \nor collectiveness. Tenant et al [15] stated that an organization\u2019s desirable culture can be \ndeveloped through company policy and operational practices, with an appropriate \nmanagement style. The management leadership should implement measures to ensure \nthat the organisation has a more open and supportive culture to encourage relevant \nlearning, cooperation and teamwork in order to improve performance. \n \nOrganizations influence the behaviours and values of its individuals and vice-versa [16]. \nOver time, there is a tendency towards uniformity of individual behaviour within an \norganization and a corresponding tendency towards uniformity of organizations within \nthe business environment. Hence regular transfusions of \u2018new blood\u2019 are desirable \nespecially if the industry is faltering. Each organization is a society unto itself and has its \nown internal culture or social system. An organization adopts values that reflect the \nadministration in charge and the environment with which it has to cope. New personnel \nsoon become aware of the value system of the organisation, either consciously or \nunconsciously, and most guide their actions accordingly [16]. These resulting actions can \nmanifest themselves as company policy. The culture of an organization comes through \nthe development of norms and values that help it to survive given the environment in \nwhich it was created and subsequently exists. \n \nThe organisation\u2019s culture should endow individuals with rules or principles that provide \nguidance when making decisions. A learning organization needs a clearly-stated purpose, \neffective communications, training about all aspect of the business, flexible structures \nand processes that facilitate introducing innovations, creativity, and risk taking [17]. \nAccompanying this effort should be systematic problem-solving experimentation, \n 8\nlearning from past mistakes and experience, acquiring know-how from others, and \ntransferring \u2018modern\u2019 reliable information from the outside world [18]. \n \nEvolution often needs the transfer of a culture: the advantages of the learning \norganization are that it provides internally an intrinsic motivation for change [19]. Further \nenergy for achieving the desirable change can be obtained through the \u201ccreative tension\u201d \nbetween the desired vision of the future and the current reality.  \n \nLearning Organization \n \nLife-long learning is a highly worthwhile process that is found in almost every facet of \nsociety. At work, we learn to accomplish certain tasks, e.g. how to (i) make wise \ndecisions, (ii) treat other people professionally within the organization, and (iii) cope with \nrapid changes. If a company is to develop the ability of continual self-improvement, its \nmain challenge lies in ensuring that its individual members\u2019 behaviours and actions [20] \nadapt successfully to the changing circumstances. \n \nBest Practices in Maintenance Management  \n \nThese enable a company to achieve a competitive advantage over its competitors, and \ninclude: \n\u0083 PM \n\u0083 inventory and procurement \n\u0083 work flow  and control knowledge \n\u0083 CMMS \n\u0083 operational involvement \n\u0083 PDM \n\u0083 RCM \n\u0083 TPM \n\u0083 financial optimization \n\u0083 continual improvement attitude \n \nPreventive Maintenance  \n \nPM reduces the amount of reactive maintenance to a level that allows other practices in \nthe maintenance process to be cost effective. Nigerian industries need to focus more on \nthe basics of PM if they are to achieve \u201cbest-in-class\u201d status, with a ratio of more than 80 \npercent proactive maintenance to less than 20 percent reactive maintenance. \n \nPM is performed to retain the equipment in a satisfactory operational condition: it is \ndivided into time-based and condition-based maintenance. Time-based maintenance is \nperformed after fixed time intervals, whether a problem is apparent or not, in order to \navoid failure of the items during operation. Time-based maintenance incurs a large cost \nfor the user in maintaining the required level of reliability, because the majority of items \nare replaced prematurely despite still having useful lives remaining. Condition-based \nmaintenance is applicable to components which tend to deteriorate rapidly with time. \n 9\nHowever, it is usually not cost effective to monitor the condition of each component: \nsome will be relatively inaccessible for monitoring. \n \nInventory (stores) and Procurement \n \nThere should be a focus on providing the right parts at the required times without having \nlarge financial outlays on stocks lying idle for prolonged periods. \n \nWork Flows and Controls \n \nA work-order procedure should be used to initiate, track and record all maintenance \nactivities. The process will start as a request that needs approval. Once approved, the \nwork is planned, then scheduled, performed and finally recorded. All the maintenance \nactivities are tracked through the work system. At least 80 percent of all maintenance \nwork should be planned on a weekly basis: the scheduled compliance should be at least \n90 percent on a weekly basis. \n \nMaintenance management systems in most companies are so complex as to require \ncomputerizing the collection, processing, and analysis of the data. The CMMS software \nmanages the functions of PM and provides support for some excellent practices. \n \nTechnical and Personal Training \nThis should ensure that all maintenance staff (i) possess the necessary technical skills to \nunderstand and maintain the plant and equipment, (ii) are able to communicate \nintelligently with other departments within the organization about pertinent matters, and \n(iii) be able to work in teams or as a group. \n \nOperations Department Involvement \nThere should be better integration between production and maintenance operatives; \nhence, all operational personnel should receive basic maintenance training. \n \nPredictive Maintenance  \n \nThe focus should be on investigating and purchasing the technology that solves or \nmitigates chronic equipment-problems. PDM inspections should be planned and \nscheduled utilizing the same techniques that are used to schedule the PM tasks. All data \nshould be integrated into the CMMS. \n \nReliability-Centred Maintenance  \n \nRCM consists of structured processes to determine the equipment maintenance strategies \nrequired for any physical asset to ensure it continues to fulfil its intended function(s) in \npresent operating conditions. The goal of RCM is to determine what the critical \ncomponents in any process are and, based on this information, design a customized \npreventive\/predictive maintenance strategy. Another strategy is the root-cause failure \nanalysis (RCFA), which is based on failures that have occurred previously .RCFA should \n 10\nlead to corrective actions beyond the component stage into the system\u2019s deficiency or \nlatent root stage. \n \nTotal Productive Management  \n \nTPM, which focuses on people and is an integral part of TQM, defines the organization \nof maintenance work by applying the following actions [21]:  \n\u0083 Cultivate a sense of ownership in the operator by introducing autonomous \noperator maintenance, whereby the operator takes responsibility for the primary \ncare of his\/her plant. The tasks involved include routine inspection, lubrication, \nadjustments, minor repairs, as well as the cleanliness and tidiness of his\/her work \nspace. \n\u0083 Optimize the operator\u2019s skills and knowledge of his\/her plant in order to \nmaximize operating effectiveness. The operator is thus mobilized to detect any \nearly signs of deterioration, wear, maladjustment, oil leaks, errant chips or loose \nparts. He\/she should regard it as his\/her duty to propose improvement suggestions \nto eliminate losses due to a sub-optimal or breakdown performance of the plant. \n\u0083 Use cross-functional teams consisting of operators, maintainers, engineers and \nmanagers to improve personnel and equipment performance. \n\u0083 Establish a schedule of clean \u2013 up and PM to extend the plant\u2019s life span and \nmaximize its uptime. \nTop management should demonstrate their commitment to TPM by devoting sufficient \ntime and allocating adequate resources to create and sustain any necessary cultural \nchanges and to provide training for employees to achieve autonomous maintenance. \n \n \nFinancial Optimization \n \nThis statistical technique combines all of the relevant data about an asset, such as the \ncosts of downtime, maintenance, lost efficiency or poor-quality end-product. It then \nassesses the data against financially optimized decisions, such as when to take the \nequipment off-line for maintenance, whether to repair or replace an asset, and how many \ncritical spare-parts should be immediately available. Financial optimization requires \naccurate data: making the associated decisions incorrectly could have a devastating effect \non a company\u2019s competitive position. \n \nContinual Improvement \n \nContinually seeking for better methods of accomplishing a task is characterized by \ndetermining incremental as well as radical improvements to existing processes. Focusing \non existing processes differentiates continual improvement from other approaches, such \nas re-engineering, which disregards existing procedures and develops new ways for \naccomplishing the task [22].  \n \nContinual improvement as part of asset care is an ongoing evolution that includes \ncontinually looking for the \u201clittle things\u201d that can make an organisation more \n 11\ncompetitive. One of the key tools for achieving continual improvement is best-practice \nbenchmarking, which examines the maintenance process presently employed and \ncompares it with those in organisations that are world leaders in this respect, and so \nhighlight the changes necessary to improve the process. \n \nCosts and Benefits of TPM \n \nTo appreciate the benefits, which could result from the implementation of a wise \nmaintenance policy, it is important to appreciate the various costs involved. Priestly [23] \nsuggested that, on average, 25 years ago, 70% of maintenance time was spent on dealing \nwith emergencies (i.e. fire-fighting), and 15% on planned preventive maintenance. If a \npolicy of \u201cfire fighting\u201d is adopted, a high proportion of the costs are always unavoidable. \nEmergency repairs mean that high inventory levels of replacement components, \nparticularly critical parts, have to be carried all the time.  Also reactive maintenance has a \nnegative impact on the production time. The cost of downtime, if determined from \npossible sales\/production lost opportunities, can be assessed accurately. \n \nIn Nigerian industries, it appears that, too often, maintenance costing is conducted in a \ncavalier non-comprehensive manner. This is due to the disparaging management attitudes \ntowards the role of maintenance in relation to the business operation. Hence, in most \nindustries in Nigeria:  \n\u0083 there are no detailed records of maintenance costs \n\u0083 maintenance is not always considered at company executive level \n\u0083 most companies ignore the real cost of downtime in terms of lost sales, despite \nmore than 20 percent of annual sales revenue being spent on maintenance. \n \nWith good maintenance management, costs can be drastically reduced in Nigerian \nindustries: plant availability could be increased and so lead up to 30 percent increases in \nprofitability being achieved. The costs of maintenance can be represented by a curve, \nsuch as figure 1. A change of attitude toward PM from the implementation of routine \nmaintenance such as inspections, lubrication, etc. to fault diagnosis and predictive studies \nwill lead to a drastic decrease in repair costs, thereby minimizing production downtime \nand losses of sales revenue [24]. \n \nTo obtain the optimal impact achievable from a TPM programme, it is important for \nmaintenance\/production managers to calculate or obtain estimates of all the costs \ninvolved \u2013see table 2. The impact of TPM on productivity levels can only be fully \nappreciated once the various costs and their impacts have been understood and \ncalculated. TPM has a direct impact on the productivity arising as a result of manpower, \ncapacity and availability, as well as on the utilization and productivity of capital assets. It \nalso has a direct impact on the number of replacement components held in store for \nmaintenance purposes (for emergency repairs) and the amounts of raw materials in stock. \nTPM would facilitate manufacturing companies getting it right first time, and having \nsignificantly reduced inventory levels. In addition, a TPM programme, which is effective, \ncan lead to the implementation of a successful TQM philosophy and therefore enable the \n 12\ncompanies concerned to meet customer requirements first time and every time  more \noften [24]. \n \nTable 2: Considerations with respect to maintenance costs [25] \n \nType of maintenance \nprogramme \nArea for cost appraisal \nIdle capacity and penalty costs \nBuffer inventories have to be established \nLost production \nBreakdowns  \nPoor quality of end-product may ensue \nManpower idle \nDesired level of service \nNumber of machine breakdowns \nReactive maintenance \nLevel of specialization \/ number of maintenance personnel \nused. \nCost derived from PM schedule \nManpower costs (relative on total manpower hours required \nfor production) incurred \nRegularly scheduled PM  \nCost of repairs (determined by PM schedule) \nBased on total number of manpower hours required for \nproduction \nInspection and randomly \nscheduled PM \nCosts based on historical manpower-usage data \nEstablishing a depreciation schedule (fixed expense) Equipment back-up \nCosts of maintenance (variable cost) \nEquipment upgrade Costs can either be treated as an immediate expense or \namortized depending both on their magnitudes and on the \noperating lifetime of the upgraded equipment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13\n \n \nFigure1: An indication on how maintenance performance should be optimised i.e. to \nincur least maintenance cost [24] \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.

However, this culture rarely exits is Nigeria, where \nindustries tend to be reactive (i.e. fire fighting when failures arise), as well as employing \nfixed-time maintenance replacements (or overhauls of components) schedules. The latter \napproach is seldom justifiable, because less than 15% of all components usually need \nreplacement at the prescribed times commonly chosen. \n \nA recommendation for Nigerian industries is to buy highly-dependable equipment that \nshould cost relatively little to maintain. The benefits thereby gained from reliable long-\nlived plant extend well beyond just lower maintenance costs: for instance, smaller stocks \nof spare parts are needed and fewer (but probably more highly multi-skilled) operators \nand maintenance personnel required. These should be empowered and motivated to \nbecome even more competent. To this end, each industry should develop a wiser \nmaintenance culture: this would require \n\u0083 the industry becoming a knowledge-sharing and learning organisation; \n\u0083 an understanding of the unambiguous objectives of TPM and RCM processes; and \n\u0083 a comprehensive and easily accessible data-base for continual improvement, \nbenchmarking, evaluation and analysis of each system\u2019s behaviour.  \nMost large companies lose between 2 and 16% of annual turnover due to downtime. In \ngeneral, human error and laziness are the causes of at least 20% of downtime costs. This \ncan be improved significantly by only using properly trained personnel and by devising \nand using appropriate information-technology controlled processes, thereby providing \nbetter proactive servicing. \n \nReferences \n \n1.
