Introduction\n[2] Ice streams are fast-flowing, linear elements within\nice sheets that attain velocities of between 0.5\u201312 km a\u00011\nand are surrounded by slower flowing ice (<0.1 km a\u00011).\nThey are important because they are responsible for most of\nthe drainage from large ice sheets in Greenland and Ant-\narctica and thus regulate ice-sheet mass balance and contri-\nbution to sea level [Alley and Bindschadler, 2001; Rignot\nand Kanagaratnam, 2006]. The behavior of ice streams\noverlying an unconsolidated substrate in West Antarctica\nhas been shown to be related closely to conditions at the ice\nstream bed. Theoretical and observational studies have\nshown that the rapid motion of these ice streams is the\nresult of deformation of the subglacial sediment layer and\/or\nenhanced basal sliding [Alley et al., 1986; Engelhardt and\nKamb, 1998; Tulaczyk et al., 2000; Kamb, 2001; Clarke,\n2005]. Deformation of this subglacial sediment layer was\noriginally modeled using a viscous rheology and was\nbelieved to be pervasive over several meters [Blankenship\net al., 1986; Alley et al., 1987]. More recently, borehole\nmeasurements from Whillans Ice Stream have shown, for\nthat ice stream at least, that deformation occurs by Cou-\nlomb-plastic failure in thin zones of about 3 cm in thickness\n[Engelhardt and Kamb, 1998]. This contrasts with borehole\nmeasurements carried out over a longer time period from Ice\nStream D that showed bed deformation at depth and \u000280%\nof ice stream motion by sediment deformation [Kamb,\n2001]. On the basis of recent modeling it has been proposed\nthat replenishment of this weak deforming till layer and its\ntransport beneath the ice stream occurs through disturbance\nand ploughing by an irregular ice stream base [Tulaczyk et\nal., 2001].\n[3] Marine geophysical and geological investigations of\nthe Antarctic continental shelf have provided detailed in-\nformation on past ice sheet extent and dynamic behavior\nduring the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). (We use the term\nLGM here in the \u2018\u2018local\u2019\u2019 sense; i.e., to refer to the period of\nmaximum glaciation during the last glacial cycle in Antarc-\ntica.) A consistent finding of these studies has been the\nidentification, within ice sheets, of zones of former stream-\ning flow (paleo-ice streams) that extended to the shelf edge\nthrough bathymetric troughs [e.g., Pudsey et al., 1994;\nLarter and Vanneste, 1995; Shipp et al., 1999; Canals et\nal., 2000; Wellner et al., 2001; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2002,\n2005a; Anderson et al., 2002; Lowe and Anderson, 2002;\nDowdeswell et al., 2006; J. Evans et al., 2005, 2006; Heroy\nand Anderson, 2005]. In general, the main focus of these\nstudies has been reconstructing ice-sheet extent, dynamics\nand the timing of deglaciation in specific areas around the\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, F03006, doi:10.1029\/2006JF000606, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Geography, Durham University, Durham, UK.\n2Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge,\nUK.\n3Now at Department of Geography, University of Loughborough,\nLoughborough, UK.\n4British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2006JF000606$09.00\nF03006 1 of 16\nAntarctic continental margin. There have been relatively\nfew studies [Dowdeswell et al., 2004a; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al.,\n2005b; Evans et al., 2005] that have utilized these data to\ninvestigate the genesis of the sub-ice-stream till layer, and\nnone that have investigated how sediment was mobilized\nand transported beneath these ice streams. These are the\naims of the current paper.\n[4] We present marine geophysical data, supplemented by\nsediment core evidence, from four paleo-ice streams which\nextended to the edge of the continental shelf through\nbathymetric troughs during the last glacial cycle. The data\ncome from the Amundsen Sea (outer continental shelf\noffshore of Pine Island Bay), the Bellingshausen Sea\noffshore of Eltanin Bay and the Ronne Entrance, Marguerite\nBay on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, and\nRobertson Trough on the east side of the Peninsula\n(Figure 1). Geophysical evidence for streaming flow in\nthese troughs has been presented in detail in previous\npublications for each of these individual areas [O\u00b4 Cofaigh\net al., 2002, 2005a, 2005b; Dowdeswell et al., 2004a;\nJ. Evans et al., 2005, 2006] and is only summarized here.\nOur principal focus in this paper is the TOPAS subbottom\nprofiler records of shallow acoustic stratigraphy and the\nassociated sediment core records from the four ice stream\nFigure 1. Map of Antarctica showing the four study areas and place names referred to in text. The\n1000-m and 3000-m bathymetric contours are shown.\nF03006 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL.: TILL GENESIS AND TRANSPORT, ANTARCTICA\n2 of 16\nF03006\nbeds. We discuss the implications of these data for the\ncharacteristics and genesis of the sub-ice-stream till layer, as\nwell as for mechanisms of sediment mobilization and\ntransport.\n2. Methods\n[5] Geophysical data on the nature of the seafloor and\nsediments beneath it were acquired during four cruises of\nthe RRS James Clark Ross to the Antarctic continental shelf\nusing hull-mounted Kongsberg-Simrad EM120 multibeam\nswath bathymetry and Topographic Parametric Sonar\n(TOPAS) subbottom profiling systems. The EM120 system\nemits 191 beams, each with dimensions of 1\u0001 by 1\u0001,\nfrequencies in the range of 11.25\u201312.75 kHz and a maxi-\nmum port and starboard-side angle of 75 degrees. In\npractice the system is typically run with maximum port\nand starboard-side angles of 68 degrees, which, in water\ndepths of about 500 m, is equivalent to a total swath width\nof about 2.5 km. The system allows detailed mapping of the\nsea floor. Data processing involved removal of anomalous\ndata points and application of corrected sound-velocity\nprofiles generated from expendable bathythermographs\n(XBTs). Vertical and horizontal uncertainties are about 1 m\nand 5 m, respectively.\n[6] The TOPAS parametric acoustic profiler uses para-\nmetric interference between primary waves to produce a\nnarrow (5\u0001) beam with user-specified secondary frequencies\nin the range of 0.5 to 5 kHz. It is used to profile the sub-\nsea-floor at high spatial resolution. Vertical resolution is\nbetter than about 2 m. The maximum depth of penetration by\nTOPAS is variable and depends on the nature of the sedi-\nments. In general, fine-grained sediments can be imaged to\ngreater depths (>100 m penetration can be achieved) than\ncoarser grained and poorly sorted deposits (typically <40 m).\nIn this study TOPAS generally penetrated sediments to\ndepths of between 2 and about 30 m on the Antarctic\ncontinental shelf. Navigation data were acquired using\ndifferential GPS.\n[7] The geophysical data were supplemented by over\n50 cores collected using 6-m-long gravity and vibro-corers.\nThe grain size, sedimentary structures, bed contacts, geom-\netry, sorting, clast shape and texture of the sediments were\nrecorded. Shear strength measurements were performed\nevery 10 cm (or closer depending on lithological bound-\naries) using a Torvane. Ten sediment samples from selected\nunits were collected for thin section preparation and analysis\nof microstructures in order to aid interpretations of sediment\ngenesis and depositional history.\n3. Geophysical and Geological Data\n3.1. Sea Floor Morphology\n[8] In all four regions discussed in this paper, well\ndefined bathymetric troughs extend from the inner conti-\nnental shelf to the shelf edge. Typical water depths in these\ntroughs are 450\u2013700 m, although over-deepened areas can\noccur with water depths greater than 1000 m (e.g., inner\nMarguerite Bay, Pine Island Bay and Eltanin Bay). The\ntroughs are bounded by shallower banks on either side that\nare generally less than 400 m deep. Streamlined subglacial\nbedforms occur along the floors of all these troughs\n(Figure 2). In the inner shelf regions of Marguerite Bay,\nPine Island Bay and the Belgica Trough region of the\nBellingshausen Sea (Figure 1) the substrate comprises\ncrystalline bedrock and the sea floor is typically irregular\nwith a rough appearance on swath bathymetric records, and\nsediment cover is thin or absent. Bedforms on the inner to\nmidshelf generally comprise streamlined bedrock and drum-\nlins (Figure 2a). This contrasts markedly with the outer\ncontinental shelf where sedimentary strata up to 2 km thick\noccur [Larter et al., 1997; Nitsche et al., 1997]. Streamlined\nsubglacial bedforms formed in this outer shelf sedimentary\nsubstrate are much more elongate. Megascale glacial line-\nations (MSGL) [Clark, 1993] formed in sediment can reach\nup to 20 km in length and have elongation ratios of up to\n90:1 (Figures 2b\u20132e). In some cases suites of cross-cutting\nlineations can be observed (e.g., Robertson Trough). These\nstreamlined bedforms record the former presence and flow\ndirection of paleo-ice streams on the continental shelf at the\nLGM.\n3.2. Acoustic Stratigraphy\n[9] The MSGL that we image on our swath bathymetric\nrecords are formed in the upper part of an acoustically\ntransparent sediment unit (Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6) [Dowdeswell\net al., 2004a; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2005a, 2005b; J. Evans et al.,\n2005, 2006]. This unit is confined to the troughs and does\nnot extend onto the adjacent banks, indicating that it is either\nabsent there or is so thin as to be below the resolution of the\nTOPAS system (better than 2 m). The transparent unit ranges\nin thickness from 1 to 19 m. InMarguerite Bay and Robertson\nTrough the unit thickness is generally <6 m; on the outer shelf\noffshore of Pine Island Bay and on the Bellingshausen Sea\nmargin it is usually less than about 12m thick. The transparent\nunit is typically acoustically homogeneous (e.g., Figures 3a,\n3c, 4a, 4c, 4d, 5b, and 6b) and internal reflectors are only\noccasionally observed (Figures 3b and 6a). There is often an\nabrupt break between the unit and adjacent areas where it is\nabsent (Figure 3c).\n[10] The nature of the basal reflector of the transparent\nunit is variable and ranges from distinct, smooth and\ncontinuous, to irregular and undulating (Figures 3, 4, 5,\nand 6) [O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2005b; J. Evans et al., 2005,\n2006]. In Marguerite Bay the basal reflector is overwhelm-\ningly smooth, continuous and often flat on both longitudinal\nand transverse subbottom profiler lines (Figures 3a and 3b).\nIn only one location is it undulatory (Figure 3c), and this\nwas relatively minor, extending over a distance of only\nabout 4 km, out of a total of 4330 km of TOPAS acquisition.\nIn Robertson Trough and the Bellingshausen Sea, the areas\nwhere the basal reflector is smooth and continuous occur in\nclose proximity (within less than 3 km) to areas where it is\nirregular or undulating (Figures 4c, 4d, 4e, and 6a). In inner\nRobertson Trough (Figures 4a and 4b) a flat to wavy\nsubbottom reflector is present beneath, and in some cases\nappears to be truncated by, the irregular basal reflector\nof the overlying acoustically transparent unit. This indicates\nthe presence of a sedimentary unit beneath, and incised by,\nthe hummocky basal reflector of the transparent unit. It\nsuggests an erosional event before, or contemporaneous\nwith, emplacement of the latter unit.\n[11] In the outermost shelf-trough offshore of Pine Island\nBay a grooved basal reflector is widespread (Figures 5a, 5b\nF03006 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL.: TILL GENESIS AND TRANSPORT, ANTARCTICA\n3 of 16\nF03006\nFigure 2.

Note that the lines perpendicular to the shelf edge and parallel to\nthe boundaries of the swath coverage are artifacts of the swath data related to variations in the sound velocity\nstructure of the water.

In this region\nthe transparent unit is sometimes distributed across the\nflanks and crests of the grooves (Figure 5b). In contrast,\nfurther inshore, the basal reflector is mainly smooth and\nhorizontal (or gently undulating), and only locally is it\nirregular. As in the case of inner Robertson Trough, a wavy\nor inclined subbottom reflector is imaged beneath, and in\nsome cases is cut off by, the hummocky basal reflector of\nthe overlying transparent unit (Figure 5b). The unit between\nthese two reflectors is composed of transparent sediment\nthat is organized into either a layer or dome-shaped lenses\ncorresponding to subglacial bedforms associated with an\nearlier phase of ice sheet flow.\n[12] A TOPAS line running \u0002100 km along the outer\nshelf trough in Marguerite Bay to the shelf edge and cross-\ncutting the MSGL at a low angle is shown in Figure 3d. The\nacoustically transparent unit is thickest at the southern end\nFigure 3. TOPAS subbottom profiler records showing acoustic sedimentary units from outer\nMarguerite Bay.

In Marguerite Bay, shear\nstrength within the diamict is usually less than 20 kPa\n(range 0\u201340 kPa) (Figure 7 and Table 1), average porosity\nis 34% (range 29\u201340%), and the clay content ranges from\n11 to 24%. Shear strength shows internal variability of 2\u2013\n15 kPa over typical sediment thicknesses of 0.1\u20130.5 m.\nSeveral cores show an abrupt increase in shear strength\ntoward the top of the diamict (e.g., cores VC295 and\nVC302, Figure 7). In Robertson Trough, the shear strength\nof the diamict ranges from 1 to 19 kPa and porosity ranges\nfrom 40 to 59% (Figure 10 and Table 1). Here shear strength\nshows internal variability of 2\u20137 kPa over typical sediment\nthicknesses of about 0.1\u20130.3 m. The maximum sediment\nthickness over which shear strength varies \u00041 kPa in the\ndiamict is \u00020.6 m in Marguerite Bay and 0.9 m in\nRobertson Trough. We refer to this unit as the \u2018\u2018soft\ndiamict.\u2019\u2019 The soft diamict is confined to cores recovered\nfrom the bathymetric troughs and is absent from cores\nrecovered from the adjacent banks.\n[14] In core section and on x-radiographs the soft diamict\nis massive, apart from the presence of occasional subhori-\nzontal shear planes, aligned clasts and rare attenuated soft-\nsediment clasts of silty to sandy mud that occur within or\nnear the base of the facies (Figures 7, 8, and 10). Investi-\ngation of the soft diamict from Marguerite Bay shows that it\nalso contains shear planes and aligned clasts at a micromor-\nphological scale. The shear planes are closely associated\nwith circular structures (interpreted to be products of rota-\ntion), sediment banding and folding (Figure 9).\n[15] The soft diamict directly overlies a much stiffer,\nmassive matrix-supported diamict (Figures 7 and 10 and\nTable 1). In Marguerite Bay shear strengths within this\nstiffer diamict are >98 kPa, clay content ranges from 6 to\n11% and average porosity is 24% (range is 23 to 29%). This\n\u2018\u2018stiff diamict\u2019\u2019 also contains a series of micromorphological\nstructures in the form of lineaments and circular structures.\nIn Roberston Trough, the stiff diamict is characterized by\nshear strengths of 20\u201398 kPa, water content of <19% and a\nporosity of 27\u201339% (e.g., core VC326, Figure 10). This\nstiff diamict was recovered in cores from both within the\ntrough (where it underlies the soft diamict) and also from\nthe adjacent shallower banks. Shear strength profiles indi-\ncate that the upward transition from stiff to soft diamict can\nFigure 7.

Occasionally, interlayering of stiff and soft diamict\noccurs (e.g., core VC340, Figure 10). The lithologies of\nclasts within the soft diamict in Robertson Trough are\nsimilar to those in the stiff diamict on the inner middle\nshelf [Pudsey et al., 2006]. This implies that the soft diamict\nis derived from the stiff diamict. The prominent subbottom\nreflector that marks the base of the acoustically transparent\nunit on the TOPAS records coincides with the abrupt\nchanges in shear strength and porosity between the soft\nand stiff diamicts.\n[16] Core VC299 was recovered from close to the edge of\nthe trough in Marguerite Bay from an area where the soft\ndiamict is not seen on TOPAS records. However, the soft\ndiamict is present in the core, but it is separated from the\nunderlying stiff diamict by a thin (7 cm) unit of massive,\nsheared clayey mud (Figure 7). The mud indicates a period\nof subaqueous deposition after emplacement of the stiff\ndiamict, but before formation of the soft diamict. Core\nVC299 is the only core where such a stratigraphy of stiff\ndiamict\u2013sheared mud\u2013soft diamict was found.\n[17] Sediment cores were not recovered from the acous-\ntically transparent layer in the outer shelf trough offshore of\nPine Island Bay. However, core NBP9902-PC39 was recov-\nered from an area of MSGL in 495 m of water (no iceberg\nscouring present) on the middle shelf of Pine Island Bay,\nwest of Burke Island (72\u000111012.100S, 105\u000140014.200W) [see\nLowe and Anderson, 2002]. The core contained massive,\npoorly sorted diamict with low shear strengths (15\u201319 kPa),\nhigh water content, mineralogical homogeneity and uniform\nmagnetic susceptibility (Table 1). Lowe and Anderson\n[2002] interpreted the diamict as a subglacial deformation\ntill formed beneath a paleo-ice stream.\n4. Interpretation and Discussion\n4.1. Identification of Paleo-Ice Streams on the\nAntarctic Continental Shelf\n[18] Ice flow within the troughs of the four study areas of\nWest Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula is inferred to\nhave been in the form of fast-flowing paleo-ice streams.\nThis is based on the following geomorphological and\nsedimentological evidence that match criteria for the iden-\ntification of paleo-ice streams [cf. Stokes and Clark, 1999].\nThese criteria are, in turn, based on modern West Antarctic\nanalogues for ice stream setting and bed character: (1) The\nhighly elongate streamlined subglacial bedforms occur in\ncross-shelf bathymetric troughs, and such troughs are com-\nmonly associated with modern ice streams and fast-flowing\noutlet glaciers [Vaughan et al., 2003; Bennett, 2003].\nSeismic investigations of the bed beneath such ice streams\nalso show the presence of streamlined subglacial bedforms\n[King et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2005]. (2) Characteristically\nthe streamlined bedforms become progressively more elon-\ngate along the troughs from short bedrock drumlins and ice-\nmolded bedrock on the inner shelf, to highly attenuated\ndrumlins and lineations on the midshelf, to MSGL on the\nouter shelf [Wellner et al., 2001; O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2002].\nThe most elongate bedforms (MSGL with elongation ratios\nup to 90:1) are typically associated with a soft bed on the\nouter shelf. This pattern is consistent with the highest\ninferred ice stream velocities occurring over the soft bed\n[cf. Dyke and Morris, 1988; Shipp et al., 1999; Wellner et\nal., 2001]. (3) Bedform orientation indicates convergent ice\nflow into the troughs. (4) MSGL are formed in a thin,\nacoustically transparent sediment unit comprising soft,\nporous sediment, which is similar to the weak till layers\ndescribed from beneath modern West Antarctic ice streams\n[Blankenship et al., 1986; Vaughan et al., 2003; King et al.,\n2004; Smith et al., 2005]. (5) Finally, published geophysical\nand core records from the continental slopes offshore of the\ntrough mouths show evidence for slope progradation and,\nwhere cores have been recovered, matrix-rich debris flow\ndeposits similar in texture and color to the soft tills\nrecovered from the troughs [O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al., 2003,\n2005a; Dowdeswell et al., 2004b, 2006]. The debris flows\nand associated slope progradation are inferred to be a\nconsequence of downslope transfer by sediment gravity\nflow of glacigenic sediment delivered directly to the trough\nmouths by paleo-ice streams [cf. Larter and Cunningham,\n1993; Laberg and Vorren, 1995; Dowdeswell et al., 1996;\nVorren et al., 1998].\n4.2. Sub-Ice-Stream Till Layer\n4.2.1. Characteristics\n[19] In the four areas of the Antarctic continental shelf\ndiscussed above, streamlined subglacial bedforms record\nFigure 8. X-radiographs of soft diamict facies.

The sediments associated\nwith this streaming flow comprise an acoustically transpar-\nent unit. Commonly, this transparent unit is internally\nhomogeneous on TOPAS records although locally it may\ncontain discontinuous internal reflectors. The transparent\nunit is confined to the troughs and is not observed on\nTOPAS records from the adjacent banks, although we\naccept that this pattern could, in part, reflect the action of\niceberg scouring in shallow water. Sediment cores from the\nunit show that it is composed of a soft (typical shear\nstrengths of 0\u201320 kPa) massive, matrix-supported diamict\ncontaining dispersed, striated clasts in a muddy matrix.\nCharacteristically the diamict shows internal variability in\nshear strength of about 2\u201315 kPa over sediment thicknesses\nof \u00020.1\u20130.5 m, although there are zones where variation in\nshear strength is \u00041 kPa over sediment thicknesses of up to\n0.6 m in Marguerite Bay and up to 0.9 m in Robertson\nTrough. Porosities within the unit average 34% in Margue-\nrite Bay and 45% in Robertson Trough (Table 1). Structures\nwithin this soft diamict include attenuated and inclined soft\nsediment clasts, shear planes and shear zones, banding,\naligned clasts, and circular structures (indicative of clast\nrotation) (Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10). On the basis of this\nevidence, we interpret the soft diamict as a subglacial till\nand further discuss its precise genesis below.\n[20] On the TOPAS records, the base of the soft till is\nmarked by a prominent and abrupt subbottom reflector.\nVibrocores from both Robertson Trough and Marguerite\nBay penetrated through the base of this soft till layer into\nthe underlying sediment. The cores show that sediments\nbeneath this reflector also consist of massive, matrix-\nsupported diamict (Figures 7 and 10), with a range of\nstructures including shear planes, sediment banding and,\nin thin section, rotational structures and faint plasmic\nfabrics. On the basis of these data we also interpret this\nlower diamict as a till. However, the lower till unit is\nmarkedly stiffer and less porous than the overlying soft till\n(in Marguerite Bay the average porosity of this stiff till is\n24% and range is 23\u201329%; in Robertson Trough, the\naverage porosity is 31% and range is 27\u201339%). Thus the\nprominent basal reflector of the transparent unit (the soft\ntill) coincides with an abrupt downcore increase in shear\nstrength and corresponding decrease in porosity, coupled to\nlower water content.\nFigure 9.

Sedimentary logs and shear-strength (kPa) profiles of representative cores from Robertson\nTrough. The horizontal dashed lines mark the contact between the soft till and overlying deglacial\nsediments. The deglacial sediments are more texturally and structurally variable than the till, with\nincreased stratification and grading and they are also associated with a color change from grey (till) to\nbrownish gray.\nF03006 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL.: TILL GENESIS AND TRANSPORT, ANTARCTICA\n11 of 16\nF03006\n[21] In Pine Island Bay, gravity cores did not penetrate\nthrough the base of the acoustically transparent layer of soft\ntill. However, the same acoustic facies is seen on TOPAS\nrecords from both Pine Island Bay and Belgica Trough,\nnamely, a transparent sediment unit (soft till) that is under-\nlain by a prominent basal reflector. We therefore consider\nthat all four paleo-ice streams were underlain by a similar\nweak, deformable, and porous sediment substrate.\n4.2.2. Genesis\n[22] We now discuss the genesis of the soft till and the\nsignificance of the upward transition from stiff to soft till.\nWe present three hypotheses by which the soft till and this\nsequence might be explained, and we attempt to discrimi-\nnate between them to achieve a plausible explanation of till\ngenesis.\n4.2.2.1. Hypothesis 1\n[23] Till deposition occurs during separate glacier advan-\nces. In this explanation the stiff and soft tills represent\ndeposits formed during separate glacial advances. In the\ncase of Marguerite Bay, support for this interpretation is\nprovided by core VC299 (Figure 7). In this core, the stiff\nand soft tills are separated by a unit of sheared glacimarine\nmud, which indicates an interval of subaqueous deposition\nfollowing formation of the stiff till but prior to formation of\nthe soft till. It is also indirectly supported by the grounding-\nzone wedges from the midshelf (Figure 3d) which, based on\nthe MSGL extending continuously across their surface,\npredate ice-streaming and formation of the soft till.\n[24] There are two explanations for this pattern: (1) the\nstiff till records one or more extensive pre-LGM ice\nadvances across the shelf followed by deglaciation and\nglacimarine deposition. Subsequently, during the LGM, an\nice stream developed in Marguerite Bay and deposited the\nmidshelf grounding-zone wedges. The grounding-zone\nwedges were then overrun and reworked by the ice stream\nduring its advance to the shelf edge. Alternatively, (2) the\nstiff till was deposited during ice advance across the shelf at\nthe LGM. This advance extended outside of the trough and\nacross the adjacent banks. This was followed by ice-sheet\nretreat and glacimarine sedimentation, with stabilization and\ngrounding-zone wedge formation on the midshelf. Subse-\nquently an ice stream developed and overrode the grounding-\nzone wedges to form the soft till.\n[25] Core VC299 is the only core which contains a unit of\nglacimarine mud between the stiff and soft tills. The\nabsence of such mud in cores from the center of the trough\ncould reflect more pervasive sediment reworking there in\nassociation with the main zone of streaming flow. There is\nno direct evidence for multiple ice advances being respon-\nsible for till formation in Robertson Trough.\n4.2.2.2. Hypothesis 2\n[26] The upward transition from stiff to soft till reflects a\nchange in the till-forming process from lodgment to defor-\nmation. Previous work from the Antarctic continental shelf\nhas interpreted overconsolidated \u2018stiff\u2019 tills as the product of\nlodgment based primarily on their high shear strength, and\noverlying soft tills within MSGL as deformation tills [e.g.,\nWellner et al., 2001; Shipp et al., 2002]. Thus initial ice\nadvance across the shelf at the LGM could have deposited\nan overconsolidated lodgment till (the stiff till). Following\nthe LGM, streaming flow developed in the troughs and the\nstiff till was reworked and deformed into a soft till.\n[27] Such an hypothesis is consistent with some of the\nsedimentological and geotechnical evidence: in all cases the\nstiff till is massive and overconsolidated; the soft till is\nweak, very porous, and shows evidence of deformation in\nthe form of inclined shear planes, folded and deformed\nintraclasts and micromorphological evidence for subglacial\nTable 1.

Lodgment is likely in the case of larger clasts which\nwould have ploughed through the matrix [cf. Brown et al.,\n1987] until frictional drag overcame forward motion of the\nclast. However, this process would also cause deformation\nof sediment in front, and to either side, of the clast and it is\ndifficult to envisage grain by grain lodgment of the finer\nmatrix. Although direct evidence in the form of a macro-\nscopically massive structure and evidence for shear are\nconsistent with lodgment, these features are also compatible\nwith subglacial deformation, as is the presence of circular\nstructures [cf. van der Meer et al., 2003; D. J. A. Evans et\nal., 2006]. Indeed, on the basis of a similar range of\nevidence, the soft till could also be a product of both\nlodgment and deformation.\n4.2.2.3. Hypothesis 3\n[29] Upward increase in dilatancy associated with A\/B\nhorizons in a deforming till. In this explanation, pervasive\ndeformation of a dilatant A-horizon results in a porous and\nmassive till underlain by a stiffer, nondilatant till (B-horizon)\n[cf. Boulton and Hindmarsh, 1987]. There are elements of\nthe sedimentological, geotechnical and TOPAS data that are\nbroadly compatible with this interpretation, namely: the\nsimilarity of the stiff till\/soft till sequence to the two-tiered\nstructure (A\/B horizons) of tills from the forefields of\nmodern Icelandic glaciers [cf. Sharp, 1984; Boulton and\nHindmarsh, 1987]; the presence of deformation structures\nwithin both tills; and the abrupt decrease in shear strength\nand increase in porosity from the stiff to soft till.\n[30] However, we note that at a micromorphological\nscale, deformation appears to have been restricted to thin\nzones of up to few centimeters in thickness, and occurs at a\nvariety of depths within the till rather than distributed\nthroughout. Furthermore, although in some cores (e.g.,\nVC326; Figure 10) the soft till does show a general upward\ndecrease in shear strength throughout, as might be expected\nin a classic A-horizon till [cf. Boulton and Hindmarsh,\n1987], this pattern is not ubiquitous (e.g., see VC324,\nVC327, VC340; Figure 10). Indeed, the soft till frequently\ncontains internal inhomogeneities in shear strength and in\nsome cores shows an abrupt increase in shear strength\ntoward its top (VC295 and VC302; Figure 7).\n4.2.3. Interpretation\n[31] Any plausible explanation of the genesis of the soft till\nmust be compatible with the following observations: (1) the\nacoustically transparent layer in which the MSGL are formed\ncomprises a soft porous till which contains deformation\nstructures; (2) this soft till is confined to the troughs and does\nnot occur on the adjacent shallow banks; (3) the shear strength\nof the soft till is generally low but there is repeated intratill\nvariability over thicknesses of 0.1\u20130.9 m; and (4) the bottom\nof the soft till is marked by a strong reflector and this marks\nthe top of the denser and stronger \u2018\u2018stiff till.\u2019\u2019 The three\nhypotheses presented above for formation of the soft till are\nregarded as \u2018\u2018end members.\u2019\u2019 There are features of the till\nwhich are compatible with each hypothesis and on this basis\nwe interpret the soft till as having formed through a combi-\nnation of these mechanisms.\n[32] The soft till is confined to the bathymetric troughs\nand is associated with geomorphic evidence for streaming\nflow. This suggests that the till formed beneath ice streams\nflowing through the troughs and over a substrate of stiff till.\nOn the basis of the sedimentological and geotechnical data\npresented above we interpret the soft till as a \u2018hybrid\u2019 till\n[cf. Nelson et al., 2005; D. J. A. Evans et al., 2006] which\nformed by a combination of subglacial sediment deforma-\ntion and lodgment. It is probable that these processes were\npartitioned according to grain size, with ploughing and\nlodgment of larger clasts, and deformation of the surround-\ning finer-grained matrix. The till contains macroscale and\nmicroscale features indicative of brittle (shear planes) and\nductile (folding and circular structures) deformation. At a\nmicromorphological scale, deformation within the soft till\nwas localized into relatively thin zones of a few centimeters\nin thickness or along discrete planes [cf. Iverson et al.,\n1998; Scherer et al., 1998; Tulaczyk et al., 1998, 2000]. The\ndeformation structures are distributed throughout the depth\nof the soft till and are not restricted to the upper few\ncentimeters. Deformation partitioning is also supported by\nthe shear strength measurements which show frequent intra-\ntill variability on the order of 2\u201315 kPa over sediment\nthicknesses of typically 0.1\u20130.5 m, reaching a maximum\nof 0.9 m, and the presence of occasional, discontinuous\ninternal reflectors within the soft till imaged by TOPAS (e.g.,\nFigure 3). The abrupt increase in shear strength at the top of\nthe till in Marguerite Bay (Figure 7) implies a period of\nstronger ice-bed coupling toward the end of deposition of the\nsoft till, and immediately prior to ice stream retreat. Such\nbulge-shaped shear strength profiles have been documented\nfrom other paleo-ice stream tills and have been explained by\nfreezing of the ice stream to the underlying till, which results\nin till dewatering and consolidation [Christoffersen and\nTulaczyk, 2003]. Weak\/strong till interlayering is also pres-\nent in cores from Robertson Trough.\n[33] Collectively, these observations are inconsistent with\npervasive deformation throughout the thickness of the soft\ntill (>10 m). Rather they imply incremental deposition of\nthe till as a series of layers 0.1\u20130.9 m thick. Thus the\nmaximum thickness of the deforming layer at any given\ntime was 0.9 m. Such abrupt changes in shear strength\nmay reflect episodic changes in porewater pressure\/content\nduring formation of the till. These observations are also\nconsistent with recent modeling from modern fast-flowing\nglaciers and ice streams that predict alternating zones of\nstiff and weak till with depth in a deforming till sheet\n[e.g., Tulaczyk, 1999; Truffer et al., 2000].\n[34] The internal characteristics of the overconsolidated\nstiff till are also consistent with formation through a\ncombination of lodgment and deformation. Deposition of\nthe stiff till is proposed to have occurred during ice sheet\nadvance across the shelf at the LGM, possibly prior to the\ndevelopment of streaming flow in the bathymetric troughs.\nThe simplest explanation for the initiation of ice streaming\nwas a change in basal effective stress and thereby an\nincrease in basal lubrication [cf. Fischer and Clarke,\n2001; Boulton et al., 2001; Parizek et al., 2002]. During\nthis streaming flow, preexisting sediments including the stiff\ntill and, in Marguerite Bay, the grounding-zone wedges,\nF03006 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL.: TILL GENESIS AND TRANSPORT, ANTARCTICA\n13 of 16\nF03006\nwere remobilized by a combination of deformation and\nploughing, and this material was advected downflow. Such\nadvection could have been accomplished by either transport\nin a deforming traction layer of sediment, or by subglacial\nmeltwater or in a zone of debris-rich basal ice, or by some\ncombination of these mechanisms. We suggest that in this\ncase the first of these mechanisms was dominant as melt-\nwater sediments were not observed in cores or on geophys-\nical records from the outer shelves, and also on account of\nthe difficulty of accreting thick sequences of debris into\nbasal ice beneath rapidly moving, active ice streams. De-\nposition of this material as a soft till took place incremen-\ntally by a combination of lodgment and progressive\nimmobilization of these thin deforming layers, probably in\nresponse to changes in porewater content\/pressure. The\nabsence of thin zones of sorted, meltwater-derived sedi-\nments within the soft till [cf. Piotrowski and Tulaczyk, 1999;\nLarsen et al., 2004] implies that although porewater pres-\nsures were probably high during periods when ice streaming\nwas occurring, they were insufficient to achieve extensive\nbasal decoupling. Thus we explain the overall vertical\nstratigraphic sequence of stiff overconsolidated till overlain\nsharply by highly porous, weak till, through an upward\nincrease in porewater content\/pressure from the stiff to the\nsoft till.\n[35] In the case of Marguerite Bay, the explanation is\nslightly more complex. If the mud layer interpreted as\nglacimarine in origin between the tills in core VC299 is\nrepresentative of conditions in Marguerite Bay as a whole,\nthe stiff and soft tills are interpreted to be the product of\ndeposition during separate ice advances. We suggest that\ndeposition during a single glacial cycle is more likely than\nduring multiple glaciations. In this explanation the stiff till\nwas deposited by a combination of lodgment and deforma-\ntion when the ice sheet advanced across the shelf during the\nLGM. Following grounding-line retreat back to the midshelf\n(Figure 3d), an ice stream developed in the trough and\nextended to the shelf edge forming the soft till. In the case\nof Robertson Trough, no sedimentological evidence was\nobserved for ice sheet retreat and glacimarine conditions\nbetween the stiff and soft tills and they are therefore\nregarded as the product of formation during a single\nadvance.\n4.3. Subglacial Sediment Mobilization and Transport\n[36] The TOPAS data show that the reflector which marks\nthe base of the soft till layer is very distinct and abrupt, but\nthey also show that its form varies both between and within\nindividual troughs from smooth, continuous and often flat,\nto irregular and grooved. Areas characterized by a flat and\nsmooth reflector can occur within a few kilometers of areas\nwhere the reflector is highly irregular and grooved.\n[37] An irregular and grooved reflector at the base of the\nsoft till implies that sediment was mobilized and added to\nthe soft till layer through grooving of the stiff till at the ice-\nbed interface. This interpretation is also supported by the\nincision of preexisting sediments by the irregular reflector\nwhich marks the base of the soft till (Figures 4b and 5a), and\nby the distribution of soft till in the outer shelf trough\noffshore of Pine Island Bay which locally occurs across the\nflanks and peaks of some of the grooves\/ridges (Figure 5b).\nThis latter pattern is inferred to result from subglacial\nsediment mobilization and deformation, whereby sediment\nis eroded and pushed forward during the grooving process\n[J. Evans et al., 2006]. Thus a zone of deforming till is\ngenerated along the sides and the tops of the grooves and\nwould be advected downflow. Grooving could have occurred\nby several mechanisms including erosion by boulders\nentrained in the base of the ice stream [cf. Brown et al.,\n1987], larger bedrock rafts or plugs of mobile sediment, or\nirregular shaped keels generated from roughness elements\nat the ice stream base [cf. Tulaczyk et al., 2001]. The scale\nof the grooves that we observe on our TOPAS records,\nwith wavelengths up to 0.5\u20131 km and depths of greater\nthan 10 m, is difficult to reconcile with erosion by\nboulders although this mechanism could contribute to the\nproduction of grooves with smaller dimensions.\n[38] In contrast, the flat, smooth and continuous reflector\nwhich characterizes the base of the soft till in parts of\nRobertson Trough, Pine Island Bay, Belgica Trough and\nespecially Marguerite Bay, represents an abrupt transition\nfrom highly porous weak till downward into much stiffer\nand less porous sediment. The flat and smooth nature of the\nbasal reflector suggests that the top of the stiff till was\nmobilized as a subglacial traction carpet that was advected\ndownflow. The base of this traction carpet represents the\ncontact between the stiff and soft tills. Such mobilization is\nlikely to be due to changes in basal effective stress whereby\nan increase in porewater pressure at the top of the stiff till\nfacilitated its deformation and remobilization [cf. Fischer\nand Clarke, 2001; Boulton et al., 2001; D. J. A. Evans et al.,\n2006]. We also acknowledge, however, that sediment could\nhave been liberated upflow through the action of ploughing.\nOn the basis of the micromorphological and geotechnical\ndata presented above, the thickness of this mobile traction\nlayer at any one time was \u00040.9 m. Thus the thick sequence\nof soft till that characterizes the outer shelf troughs would\nhave been formed incrementally through the progressive\ndeposition of relatively thin sediment layers (\u00040.9 m).\n[39] Mobilization of the stiff till and preexisting sediment\nto form the soft till would be expected to result in the\ndownflow advection of sediment toward the ice-stream\nterminus. Evidence for such sediment advection is provided\nby three lines of evidence. Firstly, in Marguerite Bay the\nTOPAS line shown in Figure 3d indicates that the soft till\nthickens downflow from the grounding-zone wedges on the\nmidshelf to the shelf edge. These grounding-zone wedges\nwere overrun by the ice stream as indicated by MSGL\nwhich extend continuously across their surface. Downflow\nthickening of the soft till from these grounding-zone wedges\nsuggests that till formation was associated with significant\nsediment advection in a subglacial deforming layer to the\nouter shelf. Secondly, geophysical data from Pine Island\nBay, Marguerite Bay and the Bellingshausen Sea indicate\nthat the inner shelf in these regions is characterized by an\nirregular bedrock substrate with relatively little sediment.\nThis scarcity of sediment on the inner shelf contrasts with\nthe outer shelf where up to 2 km of Cenozoic sediments\noccur [Bart and Anderson, 1995; Larter et al., 1997;\nNitsche et al., 1997; Lowe and Anderson, 2002; O\u00b4 Cofaigh\net al., 2002, 2005a]. This implies subglacial erosion and\nevacuation of sediment from the inner to the outer shelf,\nprobably over successive glacial cycles [cf. Hooke and\nElverh\u00f8i, 1996]. Thirdly, diamictic sediments similar in\nF03006 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL.: TILL GENESIS AND TRANSPORT, ANTARCTICA\n14 of 16\nF03006\ntexture and color to the soft tills have been recovered in\ncores from the continental slope in front of the ice stream\ntroughs in Marguerite Bay, Belgica Trough and Robertson\nTrough [Dowdeswell et al., 2004b; Evans et al., 2005;\nHillenbrand et al., 2005], and are associated with large-\nscale slope progradation in some cases [O\u00b4 Cofaigh et al.,\n2005a]. Thus the soft till is interpreted as a product of\nreworking of the stiff till and preexisting sediment.\n[40] Collectively this implies advection of significant\nvolumes of subglacial sediment beneath the paleo-ice\nstreams and delivery of this sediment onto the continental\nslope, albeit probably over several glacial cycles. A partial\nmodern analogue for such sediment advection beneath\ncontemporary West Antarctic ice streams is presented by\nSmith et al. [2005] who used reflection seismic data from\nthe Rutford Ice Stream to show that removal and accretion\nof subglacial sediment on the order of 6\u201310 m vertical\nthickness can occur in less than a decade. Thus our data\ndemonstrate that while, on the one hand, bed deformation\nbeneath paleo-ice streams on the Antarctic continental shelf\nwas restricted to shear zones of 0.1\u20130.9 m in thickness,\nthese localized shear zones can integrate [cf. Iverson and\nIverson, 2001] to produce large-scale sediment advection.\n5. Conclusions\n[41] 1. Marine geophysical data from bathymetric troughs\non the Antarctic continental shelf provide evidence for the\nformer presence of fast-flowing ice streams during the last\nglacial cycle. Streaming flow is recorded by elongate\nsubglacial bedforms, especially megascale glacial linea-\ntions, in Marguerite Bay, Robertson Trough (Larsen-A\nregion), offshore of Pine Island Bay, and Belgica Trough\non the Bellingshausen Sea margin.\n[42] 2. TOPAS subbottom profiler data show that the\nlineations are formed in the upper part of an acoustically\ntransparent sediment layer. Sediment cores from the layer\ndemonstrate that it is a weak and porous till, the base of\nwhich is marked by a strong reflector which represents the\ntop of a denser and stronger \u2018\u2018stiff till.\u2019\u2019\n[43] 3. The soft till is characterized by a range of\nstructures indicative of subglacial shear. Shear was concen-\ntrated in zones which were typically 0.1\u20130.5 m thick\n(maximum thickness of 0.9 m). Thus deformation was not\npervasive throughout the soft till and the maximum thick-\nness of the subglacial deforming layer was \u00020.9 m.\n[44] 4. Both the stiff and soft tills are \u2018\u2018hybrid\u2019\u2019 tills that\nformed by a combination of subglacial sediment deforma-\ntion and lodgment. Initiation of streaming flow and forma-\ntion of the soft till are inferred to relate to changes in bed\nlubrication and porewater pressure\/content.\n[45] 5. The TOPAS data show that the form of the\nreflector which marks the base of the soft till layer is\nvariable within and between individual troughs and ranges\nfrom flat and continuous to irregular and grooved. These\ndata are interpreted to indicate the operation of different\nmechanisms of sediment mobilization and incorporation\ninto the soft till layer. The irregular basal reflector is\nconsistent with a grooving origin through some combina-\ntion of keels at the ice stream base and\/or boulders\/bedrock\nrafts entrained within the ice. The flat, smooth and contin-\nuous reflector is more consistent with mobilization of the\nupper part of the stiff till and\/or preexisting sediment as a\nsubglacial traction carpet.\n[46] 6. Geophysical evidence for large-scale sediment\nadvection of the soft till toward the ice stream terminus,\ncombined with sedimentological and geotechnical evidence\nfor deformation partitioning into zones 0.1\u20130.9 m thick\nwithin the soft till, implies that these localized shear zones\nintegrate and result in the downflow advection of significant\nvolumes of sediment beneath Antarctic paleo-ice streams.\n[47] Acknowledgments.
