The phenomenon is further investigated \nin the present study using two of the previous tasks; a motion\/form conjunction in which \nTMS impaired performance and a colour\/form conjunction in which performance was \nenhanced with TMS. In the earlier experiment subjects were presented with blocks of \ntrials of one task type perhaps allowing some of the observed effects to arise from \nknowing the type of stimulus to be discriminated. When blocks of trials consisted of \nrandomly mixed moving\/form and colour\/form conjunction tasks, TMS over V5 still \nimpaired target-present responses for the moving\/form conjunction, but the facilitation \nseen for colour\/form conjunction target-present responses disappeared. We suggest that \nthe competitive inhibition postulated between visual movement areas and colour areas in \nthe brain in our previous paper are subject to expectation or knowledge of forthcoming \nstimulus type.  \n \n \nKeywords: V5\/MT, TMS, visual search, expectation, competitive inhibition.\n 2\n1. Introduction \n \nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of cortical visual area MT\/V5 disrupts \nperformance on tasks that require visual motion processing [28]. This finding is \nconsistent with neuroimaging and single unit studies [9, 30, 17, 24], which provide \nevidence that activity in area V5 is related to the extent to which visual motion is a task-\nrelevant attribute. TMS over V5 also leads to an improvement in performance on tasks \nthat require processing attributes other than motion, e.g. colour and form [28]. These \nresults collectively suggest that independent processing of the various visual elements in \na scene may be limited or moderated by the extent to which other attributes are relevant \nto a task. Indeed, half a century of experimental psychology testifies to this fact [e.g. 6, 4, \n25, 19]. In this paper we show that these competitive interactions between different \nsensory elements is determined by two factors: one factor is priming \u2013 what one has just \nseen\/done has an effect on how efficiently one can see\/do in the following seconds [14, \n15, 3, 7]; the second factor is the strength of competition from other attributes. To \ndemonstrate this, we compared the effects of TMS over V5\/MT on tasks that demanded \ndetection of motion or of colour and form targets in conditions when the same kind of \nattributes appeared on every trial or when the attributes to be detected were randomised \nfrom trial to trial. The results suggest that competition between cortical areas is an \nimportant factor in visual processing and that competition is affected by knowledge or \nexpectation of forthcoming visual events. \n \n 3\n2. Method \n \n2.1 TMS equipment \nA Magstim \u2122 Model 200 was used and stimulation was applied at 70% of the \nstimulator\u2019s maximum power, with a 70mm figure of eight coil. With this configuration \nthe magnetic pulse has an estimated rise time of 0.2ms and a duration of up to 1ms (see \n[1] for details).  \n \n2.2 Subjects \nTwelve subjects (aged 21-62) volunteered to take part in this experiment. All subjects \nwere right handed, had normal or corrected to normal vision, and reported an absence of \nepilepsy in their family medical history. Local ethical committee approval was granted \nfor all procedures. \n \n2.3 Stimuli \nStimuli were presented on a 270x200mm PC monitor at a distance of 100cm from the \nobserver, whose head was stabilised with a chin rest and head strap. The screen was \ndivided into an 8 column x 6 row array of 48 virtual boxes. On any trial, the target or \ndistractors could appear randomly in any one of these boxes. Stimuli were randomly \ndisplaced by \u00b13 pixels in horizontal and\/or vertical directions. \nSubjects were required to report the presence\/absence of a target by pressing one of two \nbuttons on a button box. Speed and accuracy were stressed in the instructions to the \nsubject. The target was present on 50% of trials. On each trial the subject was presented \n 4\nwith a 500ms alerting tone accompanied by a fixation spot in the centre of the monitor, \nwhich disappeared at the end of the tone. The search array was presented for 1500ms or \nuntil the subject made a response. Inter-trial interval was 4 seconds, determined by the \nrecharging requirements of the TMS machine. \n \nStimuli were displayed against a black background. Stimulus arrays were as follows: \n \nMovement\/form conjunction (fig 1) \nTarget: downwards moving white cross (X); 1.1\u00ba line length, 0.2\u00ba line thickness, \nmoving at 2.1degrees\/second. \nDistractors:  stationary white cross (X); 1.1\u00ba line length, 0.2\u00ba line thickness. \nmoving white horizontal (\u2014);1.1\u00ba line length, 0.2\u00ba line thickness, moving \nat 2.1degrees\/second. \nEasy colour\/form conjunction (fig 1) \nTarget:  stationary green cross (X); 1.1\u00ba line length, 0.2\u00ba line thickness. \nDistractors:  stationary red cross (X); 1.1\u00ba line length, 0.2\u00ba line thickness. \n  stationary green horizontal (\u2014);1.1\u00ba line length, 0.2\u00ba line thickness. \nHard colour\/form conjunction (fig 1) \nTarget:  stationary red slash (\/); 1.1\u00ba line length, 0.2\u00ba line thickness. \nDistractors:  stationary green slash (\/); 1.1\u00ba line length, 0.2\u00ba line thickness. \n  stationary red backslash (\\);1.1\u00ba line length, 0.2\u00ba line thickness. \n-------------------------------------------Figure 1 about here--------------------------------------- \n \n 5\n 2.4 Procedure \nOne group of six subjects were set the easy colour conjunction task and the motion \nconjunction task. The other group of subjects completed the hard colour conjunction task \nand the motion conjunction task. \nIn the baseline blocked condition, 2 blocks of 60 trials were presented, one with either \ncolour\/form conjunction arrays and one with the motion\/form array. In the TMS blocked \ncondition, these blocks, now of 100 trials, were each administered with a single pulse of \nTMS at 0, 50, 100, 150 & 200ms post stimulus-onset. In the baseline mixed condition, \n120 trials were presented in which either colour\/form conjunction arrays and motion\/form \nconjunction arrays were mixed. In the TMS mixed condition, 200 trials were presented. \nSingle pulse TMS was again applied at 0, 50, 100, 150 & 200ms post stimulus-onset. The \nbaseline condition had three set sizes with 4, 8, and 16 distractors. In the TMS condition, \none set size (8 distractors) was used to match conditions in the previous report [28]. \nReaction times were normalised with respect to the baseline condition (8 distractor set-\nsize). \n \nDuring TMS, the coil was placed tangential to the surface of the skull and the centre of \nthe figure of eight coil was positioned approximately 3 to 4 cm above the mastoid inion \nline and 5 to 6cm lateral to the mid-saggital plane, in accordance with co-ordinates used \nby others [e.g. 28, 11]. Stimulation was always applied to the left hemisphere. In previous \nexperiments, left hemisphere stimulation has proved sufficient to impair perception in \n 6\nbilaterally presented moving arrays. A typical TMS session lasted between 20 and 30 \nminutes. \n \n \n \n \n 7\n3. Results \n \nThis experiment sought to probe the differential effects of TMS over V5 in colour \nconjunction tasks when the task is presented in a blocked design, or mixed in presentation \nwith a motion conjunction task (MC). \n \n---table 1 about here--- \n \nTwo colour\/form conjunction tasks of different levels of difficulty were used, the \nbaseline properties of which can be seen in Table 1. The hard colour conjunction (HCC) \ntask has a serial slope (e.g. 24.1 ms\/item in the blocked design, target-present responses) \nwhereas the easy colour conjunction (ECC) task has a parallel search function (e.g. -2.9 \nms\/item in the blocked design, target-present responses). A two factor mixed design \nANOVA (distractors x task) illustrates the difference in difficultly between these tasks \ndue to the significant interaction between distractors and task (F(4,20) = 28.404, p < 0.001). \nThe slope is marginally steeper in the motion conjunction task when in a mixed design \nwith the HCC task (Table 1). Also, motion conjunction reaction times are slower in this \ncase than when mixed with the ECC task, indicating some cost of processing when mixed \nwith the harder task even in the baseline condition (see Table 2).  \n \n---table 2 about here--- \n \n 8\nTMS reaction times were collapsed across stimulation time as stimulation time had a \nnon-differential effect on reaction time (F(4, 19) = 0.083, p = 0.986). Table 3 shows the \nTMS effect on each task, normalised with respect to baseline (no TMS) reaction times. In \nthe target-absent condition TMS has a greater effect in the MC task when these trials are \nmixed with HCC as opposed to ECC. Error rates shown in tables 2 and 3 are negligible, \naveraging less than 3%. \n \n---table 3 about here--- \n \nThe effects of TMS over V5 on each of the tasks is graphically represented in figures 2a \nand b as a %difference in reaction time with TMS with respect to baseline scores. TMS \ncauses a deficit in reaction time in the MC target-present responses (fig 2a) in blocked \nand both mixed designs. On MC target-absent responses, TMS causes a deficit in reaction \ntimes in the blocked design and when MC is mixed with HCC but has no effect when MC \nis mixed with ECC.  \n \n---figure 2 about here --- \n \nIn contrast, for target-present responses, TMS causes a facilitation of performance in the \nblocked design in both ECC and HCC. For target-absent responses, there only seems to \nbe a trend towards facilitation although variance is quite high particularly in the case of \nHCC. When ECC and HCC tasks are mixed with MC, there is little or no effect on \nreaction times with TMS over V5 in either target-present or absent responses. \n 9\n In order to statistically investigate the data fully, a 4 factor mixed ANOVA was carried \nout with an A x B x C x (D) design; i.e. design [blocked\/mixed] x task [MC\/HCC\/ECC] x \npresence of target [present\/absent] x (TMS [no TMS\/TMS] within subject factor).  \nResults of this analysis are shown in Table 4. There was no significant main effect for \nTMS which is not surprising given the different directions of TMS effects shown in \nfigure 2. However, there were significant interactions between TMS and task and TMS, \ntask and design.  A significant main effect was found for presence of target, design and \ntask. Due to a significant interaction between presence of target and task the data was \nfurther analysed separately for target-present and target absent-responses.  \n \n \n---table 4 about here--- \n \n3.1 Target- Present responses: \nA three factor mixed ANOVA with an A x B x (C) design was carried out, i.e. design x \ntask x (TMS). No main effect for TMS was found (F(1, 30) = 0.144, p>0.05) due to the \nmulti-directional TMS effects but both task (F(3, 30) = 7.861, p=0.001) and design (F(1, 30) \n= 6.353, p=0.017) had a significant effect on reaction time. There was a significant \ninteraction between TMS and task (F(3, 30) = 3.890, p = 0.018).  \nThe effect of TMS in each task must be investigated as the significant interaction \nbetween TMS and task suggests a differing main effect for TMS dependant on task. To \ninvestigate the significance of each TMS effect TMS reaction times were normalised with \n 10\nrespect to their own baselines for each subject and corrected one-sample t-tests (one-\ntailed) were carried out. This revealed that TMS had a significant effect on  MC in the \nblocked and mixed (+HCC and +ECC) conditions, and that TMS significantly facilitated \nreaction times in both colour conjunction blocked conditions, but not mixed conditions \n(see Table 5 for full results). \n \n---table 5 about here--- \n \nTo investigate the source of the interaction effect, the differential effect of TMS across \ntasks was investigated by performing a two factor ANOVA on normalised TMS effects \nbetween task and design.  Task had a significant effect on TMS effect (F(3, 28) = 17.863, p \n< 0.001) as did design (F(1, 28) = 3.890, p = 0.018). There was also a significant interaction \nbetween task and design (F(2, 28) = 4.313, p = 0.023). Post-hoc Bonferroni tests show that \nthe TMS effect in the blocked MC task is significantly different to that in the blocked \nECC (p < 0.001) and blocked HCC (p < 0.001) tasks. Interestingly, there is a significant \ndifference between the TMS effect seen in the blocked ECC and mixed ECC conditions \n(p = 0.029). The difference between blocked and mixed HCC TMS effect only just \napproaches significance (p=0.061) due to greater variance in the data. The TMS effect on \nthe blocked and two mixed conditions in the MC task are not significantly different from \neach other. \n3.2 Target-Absent responses: \nA three factor mixed ANOVA with an A x B x (C) design was carried out, i.e. design x \ntask x TMS. Again, no main effect for TMS was found (F(1, 30) = 0.139, p>0.05) but there \n 11\nwas a main effect for task (F(3, 30) = 15.156, p<0.001) and design (F(1, 30) = 5.023, p = \n0.033). There was a significant interaction between TMS and task (F(3, 30) = 3.615, p = \n0.024) and also for TMS * task * design (F(2, 30) = 6.526, p=0.004).  \nDue to the fact that task has a significant interaction with TMS a series of one-sample t-\ntests (one-tailed) were carried out to analyse the TMS effect for each task. They revealed \nthat TMS had a significant effect on MC in the blocked condition (t(4) = 5.516, p = 0.002) \nand when MC was mixed with HCC trials (t(4) = 2.511, p = 0.033) (See table 5 for full \nresults). There was no significant facilitation of reaction time with TMS in the ECC or \nHCC task. \nThe interaction effects were again investigated using normalised TMS reaction times \nwith respect to their own baselines for each subject. The differential effect of TMS over \ntasks was investigated using a two factor ANOVA (task x design). It showed a main \neffect for task (F(3,28) = 4.185, p = 0.014) and a significant interaction between task and \ndesign (F(2, 30) = 8.109, p = 0.002). Post-hoc Bonferroni  tests showed that there were \nsignificant differences between TMS effects in the blocked HCC and mixed HCC (p = \n0.017) conditions and blocked MC, mixed MC (+HCC) and HCC (p = 0.001 in both \ncases). \n \n 12\n4. Discussion \n \nThe main finding of this experiment was a difference between the effect of TMS over V5 \nwhen subjects either did or did not know the visual stimulus type to be presented on each \ntrial. When subjects were presented with a block of trials in which colour and form \nprocessing but not motion analysis was required, TMS over V5 facilitated performance. \nHowever, when subjects had no foreknowledge of the discrimination, the facilitation \ndisappeared. The second finding of the experiment was that TMS effects on motion \nsearch are robust for target-present trials irrespective of blocked or mixed trials. In target-\nabsent trials, deficits in reaction time in motion trials with TMS over V5 are only \ndemonstrated in the blocked condition and when motion trials are mixed with trials \nrequiring a serial search. \n \nAn explanation for the main finding may involve two phenomena known to involve \nextrastriate cortex - priming and attribute competition. Priming refers to the fact that \nreaction times to find a target are faster when the same target was present on the \npreceding trial. Two studies have recently shown that extrastriate areas V4 and TEO are \nimportant sites for visual object or attribute priming [2, 29]. Also, psychological studies \nsuggest that in the movement domain, area V5 occupies a similar role to these areas [20, \n13]. For our argument however, the critical point is that V4 and TEO are known to be \nimportant for colour and form priming [20] and V5 for motion priming, as we have \nrecently shown [5]. There are also several convincing accounts of competition between \nstimuli within receptive fields of areas V5 [24], V4, and IT [16, 8]. These accounts of \n 13\ncompetition are limited to single stimulus domains (motion vs. motion, colour vs. colour \netc.), but it is a small step to suggest that competition may also exist between different \nvisual attributes (and therefore between specified visual areas). This is particularly \npertinent to situations where a perceptual decision is required or the stimuli potentially \noccupy the same regions of visual space. In light of the above facts and the extensive \nanatomical connections between areas V4 and V5 [10], our results suggest the following \ninterpretation. When subjects receive magnetic stimulation over area V5, a degree of \nneural noise is introduced in the motion processing system [c.f. 26, 27]. This neural noise \nwill not only affect V5 processing but may also have consequences for processing in \nareas connected with V5. In this case we propose that V4 and V5 compete for processing \nresources to maximise the analysis of their own favoured attributes. These resources can \nbe access to other visual areas (e.g. STS or posterior parietal cortex or even back \nprojections to V1, [18]), access to blood supply or access to regions of cortex responsible \nfor generating motor responses. Adding noise to the V5 system will therefore reduce any \ncompetitive or inhibitory influence it has on V4, resulting in an increased efficiency in \nV4 processing as seen in the reaction time enhancement. The failure of TMS over V5 to \nenhance reaction time to colour and form in the mixed condition suggest that, in this task \nat least, disruption of V5 is alone insufficient to 'liberate' V4 and that V4 can only benefit \nif the type of stimulus to be presented is predicable. \n \nThere are two strong predictions from this competition-based account of our data. The \nconverse results should be obtained if TMS were applied to V4 - colour\/form processing \nshould be impaired and motion processing enhanced. Our second prediction is that the \n 14\nresponses of single-units in V4 or V5 should depend not only on competing stimuli \nwithin the receptive field but also on competing stimuli in different stimulus domains. \nThat activity in visual areas is selectively enhanced by expectation of a stimulus has been \nshown in brain imaging studies [23, 12]. \n \nThe second finding, that the effects are more robust for blocked trials, also yields to an \nexplanation based on known facts about the visual system. TMS effects on motion search \nare robust for target-present and target-absent in the blocked condition. When motion \ntrials are mixed with easy colour\/form trials, TMS deficits are seen for target present but \nnot target absent trials. It has recently been shown that V5 is important in monkeys in \nholding representations of targets defined by direction of motion [22]. When no target is \npresent or when the direction of non-targets needs to be computed it may be the case that \nother areas sensitive to direction of motion can filter distractors. There are several \nreasonable candidates for this kind of role - V3, V3A, posterior parietal cortex, even V2, \nand, if the stimuli are slow enough, V4.  \n \nHowever, using the harder conjunction-type trials, there is a deficit in reaction time for \nmotion target-absent responses. This may be due to the greater processing load required \nby the harder colour\/form conjunction task; a higher load in a competing area may be \nconsidered as higher competition against V5 and therefore yielding a greater combined \neffect of TMS over V5 and competition with it [21]. In such a case, TMS will have an \neffect on motion target-absent trials.  \n \n 15\nThe proposed explanations for these findings provide a novel way of looking at the \nfunctions of lateral connectivity within extrastriate cortex. The most common proposal is \nthat lateral connections may facilitate binding of features in space or time, but a \ncompetitive account may also provide an alternative to the temptation to look outside the \nvisual areas for explanations of stimulus processing that involves anything more complex \nthan detection or discrimination. A more complex factor could be the difference in \nmemory load for mixed trials i.e. two targets to be remembered rather than one. However \nthe direction of the deficits and enhancements would be difficult to explain in terms of \nmemory and it is unlikely that memory affects would be differential with respect to \nstimulus type since both had to be remembered. Although it is common to invoke top-\ndown inputs from prefrontal cortex or posterior parietal cortex in the explanation of \ndifferential processing it could be perhaps that much more of the battle is fought at earlier \nlevels of cortex.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis research was supported by grants from The Wellcome Trust, The Royal Society and \nthe Dr. Hadwen Trust. \n 16\nReferences \n \n[1] Ashbridge, E., Walsh, V. & Cowey, A.

The moving\/form conjunction stimulus array consists \nof a moving cross target, with stationary crosses and moving horizontal lines as distractors. The \nstationary colour\/form conjunction stimulus consists of a green stationary cross (solid lines) as \ntarget, with green horizontal lines (solid lines) and red crosses (dashed) as distractors. Target \nabsent trials are also represented. \n \nTable 1:  \nSlope and intercept data for each condition in the baseline (no TMS) condition. Note that one of \nthe colour\/form conjunction tasks was easy and performed in a parallel manner with negative or \nnegligible slopes. The motion conjunction task yields a slightly steeper slope and higher \nintercept when mixed with the harder colour conjunction task (hcc) than the easy colour \nconjunction task (ecc). \n \nTable 2: \nMean reaction times and error numbers as a function of distractor display size in the baseline \n(no TMS) condition. It can be seen here also that mixing the motion conjunction with the hard \ncolour conjunction (hcc) task yields higher reaction times than when it is mixed with an easy \ncolour conjunction (ecc) task. \n \n \nTable 3: \nNormalised reaction times and mean error number in the TMS condition. Again, results are \nshown for the motion conjunction task when it was mixed with the easy colour conjunction task \n(ecc) and the hard colour conjunction task (hcc). \n  \nFigure 2:  \nPercentage reaction time deficit in TMS trials with respect to baseline reaction times for \nblocked and mixed trials in motion\/form and colour\/form (easy and hard) conjunctions for \ntarget present responses (A) and target absent responses (B).
