In \nparticular I am interested in how students who rent accommodation in Birzeit and make \nfrequent trips to the cities and villages where they grew up experience a range of \nim\/mobilities that are heavily impacted by technologies and practices of the Israeli \nOccupation Forces that are designed to render Palestinians less mobile in the West Bank. \nAfter mapping how students understand these im\/mobilities, I explore how these \ndifferently mobile practices create Birzeit as place, how they unsettle particular notions \nof home, and the micropolitical responses they embody and engender. \n \nKeywords: Palestine, mobilities, immobilities, students. \n \nIntroduction \n  \n\u201cAll the world seems to be on the move\u201d (Sheller & Urry 2006: 207). \n \nDina\ni\n: We used to go to Nablus, forty-five minutes, do some shopping \u2026 because Nablus \nis cheaper. Now, I wouldn\u201ft go because I would have to go through Hawara \n[checkpoint]\u2026 so now we would rather stay in our area.  \n(Female villager, interview conducted on 6\nth\n April 2006, in English and Arabic). \n \nWhile all the world might seem to be moving, the extent of these movements can vary a \ngreat deal depending on the subject(s) and place(s) under scrutiny. As Barker et al \n(forthcoming) note in the introduction to this collection, age is a key component in the \nconstruction of mobilities. In this paper I want to explore how the mobility experiences of \none group of university students \u2013 a rarely researched \u201eolder\u201f group of \u201eyoung\u201f people \n 3 \n(although see Kenyon 1999, Holdsworth 2006, Chatterton 1999, Long 2006a) \u2013 are \nentangled with their identities as Palestinians and their experiences of tertiary education. I \nhope to broaden debates around students\u201f mobilities that have tended thus far to focus on \nsocial mobility rather than actual material im\/mobilities (Kenyon 1999, Holdsworth 2006, \nChatterton 1999, Long 2006a). Holdsworth (2006: 496) notes \u201egoing to university is \nrecognised as an important rite of passage for young people. Yet there is relatively little \nresearch on students\u201f experiences of HE [Higher Education] and how this relates to wider \nissues about transitions to adulthood\u201f. Hence this research may also indirectly offer an \nempirical account of one aspect of a transition from childhood to adulthood (Valentine \n2003) in a non-first world context.  \n \nThe empirical context for this research \u2013 Palestine \u2013 is crucial. Living with\/through \nrelative im\/mobility has become an important issue for all people living in the Occupied \nTerritories and, consequently, it has become an important analytical dimension for those \nwriting about these spaces (see for example Hammami 2004, 2006, Gregory 2004, Halper \n2001, Long 2006b, Weizman 2002, 2007). Certainly during my research in the village of \nBirzeit, just north of Ramallah in the centre of the West Bank, it was impossible to avoid \n(see figure 1)\nii\n. While I was interested in how students who rented accommodation in the \nvillage made these spaces more \u201ehomely\u201f, I was repeatedly told that their homes were \nelsewhere. I realized very quickly that for students renting accommodation in Birzeit, the \nexperience of university is to a great extent shaped by mobilities between Birzeit and an \nelsewhere. It also became clear that even the time students spend \u201ein\u201f Birzeit was \nsaturated with different forms of im\/mobility, ranging from the banal and quotidian to the \nmore exceptional and arrhythmic movements.  \n[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]. \n \nIn what follows I begin by defining im\/mobility as relational and differential movement, \nand then describe the politics of mobility in the West Bank as it is conceived \ngeopolitically. I then introduce the methods I employed during my fieldwork in Birzeit to \nexplore how Palestinians experience these im\/mobilities in their everyday lives. The main \nbody of the paper explores the range of relative im\/mobilities that constitute Birzeit \n 4 \nstudents\u201f daily journeys to and from the university and their regular journeys to and from \n\u201ehome\u201f, and how students understand these relative im\/mobilities. I then examine how \nthese im\/mobilities affect constructions of home and Birzeit as place, before drawing \nsome conclusions about the broader consequences of contemporary student im\/mobility \nin Palestine.  \n \nDefining im\/mobilities \n \nWhile readers of this journal are no doubt familiar with much of the recent work on \nmobilities (e.g. Hannam et al 2006) and arguments for the emergence of a mobilities \nparadigm (Sheller & Urry 2006), I want to briefly outline how I understand and use the \nterms mobility and immobility with respect to students at Birzeit University. Cresswell \n(2006: 2-4) suggests that the term mobility describes movements shot through with \nrelations of power\/knowledge (meaning). Mobilities, he argues, must be understood as \nsimultaneously corporeal practices that are experienced and representations that (re-\n)iterate meaning(s). He is quick to point out that these materials and meanings are \nconstantly in the process of intersecting and interacting, leading to dynamic and \ncontingent mobilities. Furthermore, all mobilities must be understood in relation to one \nanother (p9). Adey (2006) extends this point by unfolding the idea of \u201erelative \nimmobilities\u201f, a phrase that emphasizes not only the relational, but also the differential \nways in which mobilities interact. Summarizing a body of work on the politics of \nmobility, Adey makes the important point that these differences are politically charged. \nMobilities are contested and contest one another. Certain mobilities require other relative \nimmobilities to function and these relations are contingent. Cresswell (2006) exemplifies \nthis point well in his discussion of the Los Angeles Bus Riders Union\u201fs (BRU) struggle \nand court case against the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), after the \nMTA sought to raise bus fares, which adversely affected poor residents, while \nsimultaneously subsidizing a light rail system that predominantly benefited more affluent \nsuburban residents. \n \n 5 \nThe actions of the Bus Riders Union are remarkable in that they have enacted a \npolitics of mobility based on the recognition that different people, in different \nplaces, are differently enabled and constrained in terms of their mobility\u2026 The \nBus Riders Union insisted on a form of spatial justice, pointing out the inequities \ncreated by the production of one form of mobility at the expense of another. To \nthe activists it is not possible to think of mobility in the form of public transit \nwithout thinking about race. While some, principally white and suburban, areas of \nLos Angeles were having their modes of mobility enhanced, the vast majority of \npoor, nonwhite, urban areas, were having theirs reduced (p172). \n \nThroughout this paper I use the term im\/mobilities to continually (re-)invoke this \nemphasis on the relational and differential nature of mobilities. Foregrounding \nim\/mobilities as relational and differential movements is vital when trying to understand \nthe experiences of Birzeit students. Nearly all Palestinians living in the West Bank, \nincluding students, face serious challenges to their relative mobility when trying to travel \nthrough the West Bank\niii\n. While the Israeli Occupation has had a profound effect on \nPalestinian mobilities since 1948 (when 750 000 Palestinian refugees were exiled from \ntheir lands, see Morris 2004), the current mobilities regime in the West Bank is strongly \nlinked to the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. These agreements chopped up the \nWest Bank into Areas A (18% of the territory), B (22 % of the territory) and C (the \nremaining 60% of the territory), all divided by checkpoints, roadblocks and closures that \nare policed by the Israeli Occupation Forces (See Figure 2, also Makdisi 2008). \n[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE]. \n \nHalper (2001: n.p.) uses the term \u201eMatrix of Control\u201f to describe this state of affairs, a \nconcept that is explicitly concerned with Palestinian immobility.  \n \nThe Matrix, an intricate and an interlocking series of control mechanisms, \nresembles the Japanese game of \"Go.\" Instead of defeating your opponent as in \nchess, in \"Go\" you win by immobilizing the other side, by gaining control of key \npoints of a matrix, so that every time your opponent moves he or she encounters \n 6 \nanother obstacle. \n \nB\u201fTselem, The Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, \nstates that as of December 2007, there are 99 permanent Israeli checkpoints throughout \nthe West Bank (B\u201fTselem 2007). The United Nations Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) also lists the number of flying (\u201esurprise\u201f) \ncheckpoints, which vary from an average of 69 a week in October 2007 to 141 a week in \nMay 2007 (OCHA 2007), figures that in themselves demonstrate how arbitrary and \nunpredictable these barriers to movement are. In October 2007 there were also 387 \nobstructions (in the form of dirt piles, fences, locked gates and trenches) that closed \nroads, and Palestinian traffic was restricted from or forbidden to use twenty-four sections \nof roads in the West Bank, covering a distance of some 311 km (B\u201fTselem 2007). All of \nthese figures fluctuate according to political developments and the inclinations of the \nIsraeli Occupation Forces. The relative Palestinian immobilities that these checkpoints, \nobstacles and road closures enforce, must be seen in relation to the relative mobilities that \nthey create for Israeli settlers living illegally on Palestinian land.  \n \nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank are dormitory suburbs, reliant on roads \nconnecting them with the urban centres of Israel proper. So-called \u201ebypass\u201f roads \nwere a feature of the Oslo accord. The Israeli government was allowed (with \nspecially allocated American money) to construct a network of fast, wide security \nroads that bypass Arab towns and connect the settlements to Israel. \n \nThe bypass roads, some still in the process of paving, would become a massive \nsystem of twenty-nine highways spanning four hundred and fifty kilometres. They \nallow four hundred thousand Jews living in land occupied in 1967 to have \nfreedom of movement. About three million Palestinians are left locked into \nisolated enclaves. \n(Weizman 2002: n.p.) \n \nWhile materials and technologies such as checkpoints and the identity card system (see \n 7 \nAbu Zahra 2007) do allow for a range of mobilities, they also act as barriers, defined here \nas material socio-technical processes that render other bodies and materials (in this case \nPalestinian) less mobile (irrespective of the mobility they enable). These (relatively) \nimmobile materials are therefore of a somewhat different nature than mobile phone masts \nand coaxial cable systems (Sheller & Urry 2006: 210-1), immutable materials that are \ndesigned to facilitate greater mobility. I think it is important to foreground these barriers \nbecause while Sheller & Urry (2006) urge an approach to studying mobilities that has \ndifferential power relations at its core, there is still very little work by those who have \ncontributed to the \u201enew mobilities paradigm\u201f that actually focuses on those rendered \nrelatively immobile. In this paper I seek to redress this balance by highlighting a number \nof barriers that are material and\/or imaginative, legal and\/or socio-technical. This is not to \ndownplay the relative mobilities that these relative immobilities enable and connect to. \nRather I want to begin with relative immobilities and then move on to these more mobile \nconnections, rather than the other way around. \n \nThe differential im\/mobilities and their immersion in relations of power in Palestine, have \nalso led to the unfolding of distinct spatial politics. Weizman (2002: n.p.) uses the phrase \n\u201epolitics of verticality\u201f, to describe how three-dimensional space is crashed into six \ndimensions, three Jewish and three Arab (see also Weizman 2007, Gregory 2004). \nHowever, it is not simply a matter of three Israeli dimensions being overlaid on three \nPalestinian ones. Rather, Weizman suggests the spatiality of occupation is \u201eEscher like\u201f, \nas Palestinians and Israeli spaces pass through, around, below and above one another: \nIsraeli tunnels dive into Palestinians mountains; Palestinian dirt tracks pass beneath \nIsraeli highways. Hence roads, bridges and tunnels all becoming key processes through \nwhich Israel performs its occupation of Palestine. However, the politics of verticality is \nnot something that is simply imposed on the Palestinian population by the Israeli \nOccupation Forces without response. The Israeli checkpoints and the relative Palestinian \nimmobility that they cause have also become lightening rods for grass-roots activism. In \naddition to the statistics and monitoring produced by B\u201fTselem that I have already drawn \non (see http:\/\/www.btselem.org\/), Machsom Watch, a group of Israeli \u201eWomen for \nHuman Rights\u201f produce frequent (in some cases daily) first hand reports of the conditions \n 8 \nand relative im\/mobilities for Palestinians at the permanent checkpoints throughout the \nWest Bank and Gaza Strip (http:\/\/www.machsomwatch.org\/). Their goals are threefold: \n(i) monitor the behaviour of the Israeli military, (ii) monitor\/protect Palestinian human \nand civil rights, and (iii) bear witness in the form of reports after each observation \n(Machsom Watch 2008). The \u201eRight to Education Campaign\u201f \n(http:\/\/right2edu.birzeit.edu\/), an indigenous Palestinian organization set up within \nBirzeit University, seeks to address the difficulties Palestinian students face while trying \nto obtain tertiary education. A significant part of this campaign focuses on problems of \naccess and mobility that many students and staff currently face at both Birzeit and other \nuniversities in Palestine (see Right to Education 2007a, 2007b, 2007c).  \n \nI highlight the work of these organizations here to suggest that im\/mobilities in the West \nBank are not only enforced and contested geopolitically, but also, simultaneously, by \nnon-state actors. Due in part to the work of these activist groups, the instruments and \ntechniques used by the Israeli Occupation to render the Palestinian population less mobile \nare relatively well documented (see also Abu Zahra 2007). I want to explore the \nim\/mobilities of students because, while these instruments and techniques of occupation \ndo have a great deal of impact on people studying at Birzeit University, student mobilities \nare not simply a series of encounters with technologies of occupation (what I described \nearlier as barriers) designed to render them (relatively) less mobile. As I will discuss, \ntheir mobilities are related to a number of other mobilities, some of which are occupation \nrelated and some of which are not. In examining some of the relations of mobility that \nstudents attending Birzeit experience, I am interested not so much in the politics that \nWeizman describes, but rather something closer to what Connolly terms \u201emicropolitics\u201f, \ntechniques of the self organized and deployed collectively, which \u201eoperate below the \nthreshold of large legislative acts and executive initiatives\u201f while nevertheless setting the \n\u201econditions of possibility for these more visible actions\u201f (2002: 20-1). Through this \narticle I want to map some of these on-going micropolitical practices in order to examine \nhow the different im\/mobilities experienced by students at Birzeit University are \nunderstood, their effects on (among other things) ideas around place and home in Birzeit, \nand some of the potential spatial consequences for Palestinian population more broadly. \n 9 \n \nThe research in this paper is based on eleven months of fieldwork in Birzeit, conducted \nover the course of three visits to Palestine between 2005 and 2007. During this time I \nlived in Birzeit myself, carried out participant observation and conducted interviews with \npeople residing in village, which included students who were renting accommodation \nthere while attending Birzeit University. Due to the social context in which my research \ntook place \u2013 marked by a distinct separation of genders \u2013 the majority of my interviews \nwere with male students. However, since the social space of the university is more liberal \n(something I comment on later in the paper), I was able to interview a few female \nstudents too. The interviews, which lasted between thirty minutes and one hour, were \nconducted in English or in colloquial Arabic with the use of a translator, who translated \nall the Arabic language quotations I use in this paper. \n \nIn addition to these linguistic differences, I think it is also important to foreground the \nfact that my observations and conversations are saturated by my own relative mobility \nwithin and between Palestine and Israel (where most Palestinians are currently prohibited \nfrom traveling). However, while my subjectification in the West Bank as a non-\nPalestinian British passport holder enabled me to travel without (much) fear of being \narrested or prevented from traveling somewhere by the Israeli Occupation Forces, I \nnevertheless traveled in the same public buses and communal taxis as most Palestinians, \nwalked or rode through the same checkpoints, and consequently sat or stood in the same \nqueues and experienced many of the same delays. My research also took place \nexclusively within the village and at the university, and hence while my research \nparticipants occasionally asked me about my relative mobility, none of the mobile \nexperiences that I shared with Birzeit students were marked explicitly by our different \nrelative mobilities. This was because the journeys we made never exceeded the confines \nof the Ramallah region in which a higher degree of mobility (relative to the rest of the \nWest Bank) was possible during the time I was doing research. This lack of travel \nelsewhere is also indicative of the movement restrictions in the West Bank. \n \n 10 \nAn Im\/mobile Student Body? \n \nBirzeit University is a private institution located on the edge of Birzeit. The university is \nthe oldest in Palestine, and also demands the highest tawjihi (or high school leaving \ncertificate) score of any of Palestine\u201fs eleven universities. Beginning life as a school in \n1924, the first bachelor degrees were awarded in 1976 (Birzeit University 2007a). At \npresent the university offers a number of Masters degrees in certain subjects, but those \nwishing to do doctoral research must still study in other countries. Recently, this has \nbecome an increasingly difficult task to accomplish (Hass 2007a, 2007b). The university \nis the largest employer in the town of Birzeit, and its many trickle down effects include \ntriggering the town\u201fs currently booming student-housing market.  \n \nAt the time of writing, almost 7800 students attend the university (Birzeit University \n2007b), and it is estimated that around 500 of them rent accommodation in Birzeit. The \nmajority of these students now come from villages and cities around the West Bank. Prior \nto the Al Aqsa (second) Intifada in 2000, there were 350 students who came from the \nGaza Strip (Right to Education 2007a). However since that time students from Gaza are \nno longer permitted to travel to the West Bank, and hence there are currently less than \nfifteen students from Gaza currently attending Birzeit University, all of whom have been \nresiding \u201eillegally\u201f in the West Bank since 2000 (Right to Education 2007a, Hass 2007a, \n2007b).  \n \nStudents who come from cities and villages around the West Bank have also faced \nincreasing travel difficulties since the beginning of the Al Aqsa Intifada. The restrictions \non movement imposed by the Israeli Occupation Forces included a checkpoint built in \n2001 in the village of Surda, which lies on the main road between Ramallah and Birzeit \n(Hammami 2004, Right to Education 2007b). This delayed and sometimes prevented \nstudents and staff who lived in Ramallah, its surrounding villages and other cities and \nvillages south of the university from reaching the campus. Hammami\u201fs (2004: 26-7) \nethnography vividly describes what the Surda checkpoint was like: \n \n 11 \nCommuters would disembark from the transit vans that jammed both ends of the \nno-drive zone. Skirting rubble and concrete blocks, they would trip down the \nvalley and hold their breath as they passed Israeli soldiers, before finally trudging \nup the incline to the vans on the other side. Thousands made the walk every day. \nIn the morning, the flow of fashionably dressed students on their way to the \nuniversity crossed the flow of villagers heading into Ramallah for work and the \nservices that can only be found in a city. In the afternoon, the pattern would repeat \nin reverse. Those who got thirsty along the way could grab a drink from a roving \npeddler. Other who had forgotten groceries could stop at one of the makeshift \nstands nicknamed \u201cthe duty free\u201d. \n \nOn the worst days, trigger-happy soldiers suddenly prohibited pedestrian traffic, \nand students and villagers were stranded on the wrong side of getting to work or \nhome. More commonly, soldiers would drop in at the checkpoint for a few hours, \nto toy with the droves of walking commuters, stopping all \u2013 or a select few \u2013 for \ninterminable identity card and baggage checks. As often, they would \u201corganize\u201d \nthe drivers and peddlers by ramming their vans or stands with their jeeps. Over \nthree years at the Surda checkpoint, three Palestinians were shot to death by the \nIsraeli military, another two died in accidents among the crush of vans, at least \none man died of a heart attack as he was wheeled across on a stretcher, two babies \nwere born behind a rubble mound and untold numbers of young men were beaten \nby soldiers, often in full public view. No one has counted the numbers of injured \nat the demonstrations staged in futile attempts to clear the checkpoint away. \n \nAnother effect of the Surda checkpoint and the relative immobilities it created was to \nforce more students than usual to rent accommodation in the village of Birzeit. \n \nAnais: There was a great deal of pressure on the rental market, because lots of \npeople wanted to live there [in Birzeit] and there weren\u201ft many apartments at that \ntime. During the closures it was very difficult. There were checkpoints at Atara \nand Surda. People from everywhere were trying to live in Birzeit. From Khalil \n 12 \n[Hebron], Areeha [Jericho], Jenin, the North, even Ramallah. Even people who \nlive in Ramallah were taking lodgings in Birzeit, so you can imagine how \ncrowded it was. Even from Atara [the village right next to Birzeit]. \n(Male student, interview conducted on 13\nth\n May 2006, in Arabic). \n \nWhile the Surda checkpoint was removed in December 2003, many other checkpoints \naround the West Bank remain (Hammami 2006), including the Atara checkpoint that was \nbuilt on the northern edge of Birzeit. In September 2006, the month after I finished the \nmajority of my fieldwork, the UN OCHA (2006: 3) estimated that 2,317 Birzeit students, \nover a quarter of the university\u201fs enrollment, pass through the Atara checkpoint on a \ndaily or weekly basis (see figure 3).  \n \n[INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE]. \n \nEven students renting accommodation in Birzeit can face restrictions on movement that \naffect their journey from their residence to the campus. The University, which was closed \nby the Israeli Occupation Forces for just over four years between 8\nth\n January 1988 and \n29\nth\n April 1992 (Birzeit University 2007a), is still periodically affected by flying \ncheckpoints and\/or temporary road closures at the entrance gate, both of which happened \nwhile I was studying there in the summer of 2005. The potential of closures can also be \njust as problematic as closures themselves. Khader, a twenty-seven year old student who \nstudies business and administration doesn\u201ft like to visit the village north of Hebron where \nhe grew up because he has been issued with five summons by the Israeli Occupation \nForces, asking him to report to the Israeli security services for \u201equestioning\u201fiv. Since he \nhas not reported voluntarily for fear of incarceration, he is worried that he will be \nsummarily arrested at any minute. These summons therefore cause problems for him \nwhen he wants to move between the village of Birzeit where he rents accommodation and \nthe campus. \n \nMe: How many classes have you missed at university because of your problems? \n \n 13 \nKhader: I don\u201ft know, but sometimes I only go to university two days of the \nweek. I prefer to pick my classes in the middle of the day, between eleven and \ntwo o\u201fclock\u2026 At three o\u201fclock the Israeli patrols change\u2026 Most of the students \ngo home at that time, so they [the Israeli army] take advantage of that. \n\u2026 \nKhader: They [the Israeli army] also raid the university during final exams \nbecause they know we can\u201ft miss them. \n \nMe: Did you miss exams? \n \nKhader: Yes\u2026 I failed some of my classes and I have to make it up. \n\u2026 \nKhader: The thing I worry about is not being able to go to university. If I finish \nuniversity, then going to prison would be like a vacation. I would have peace of \nmind and wouldn\u201ft have to worry about anything. \n(Male student, interview conducted on 22\nnd\n February 2006, in Arabic). \n \nKhader\u201fs movement not only takes into account the Israeli army patrols, but also the \nIsraeli legal-security apparatus that issued the summons. His relative immobility is not \nsimply a product of physical barriers but also legal\/bureaucractic and imaginative \nbarriers. As I have suggested earlier, these barriers are important to note because while \nrelative immobilities are frequently alluded to theoretically (Hannan et al 2006, Sheller & \nUrry 2006) they are often invoked simply to play the foil to a more comprehensive \ndiscussion of relatively more mobile processes. Discussions in which relative \nimmobilities have been given more substantive empirical focus frequently revolve around \ninternational borders (see examples in Adey 2006, Cresswell 2006), which in the case of \nIsrael and Palestine would implicate the de facto border that is the Occupation wall. \nHowever, while Khader\u201fs life is undoubtedly affected by this highly visible \nborder\/barrier, his testimony suggests that more local, less visible and frequently more \nintangible (rather than material) barriers are currently of greater consequence to him. \n \n 14 \nKhader\u201fs case also draws attention to perhaps the most severe form of relative immobility \nthat can affect Palestinian students, incarceration, frequently done without charge or trial. \n349 Birzeit students have been arrested since 2003, and 87 are currently incarcerated \n(Right to Education 2007c), although this figure fluctuates frequently. The Right to \nEducation (2007c: n.p.) campaign also report that 35 detainees (of the 87) have yet to be \nfound guilty of any charge, and \u201e21 out of 40 cases represented by Birzeit University's \nlawyer\u2026 are serving time solely for their belonging to student societies or political \nparties, many of whom held positions of leadership in the Student Council at the time of \ntheir arrest\u201f. Due to the frequency with which students are arrested, the university has \ndeveloped a pastoral system specifically for such occurrences, which includes fee \nremittances and methods for completing courses once students have been released even if \nthey have missed classes.  \n \nStudents Going Home \n \nApart from the journey between the university and their accommodation, perhaps the \nmost important and in some cases most frequent movement students at Birzeit University \nmake is the journey between Birzeit and their home. While many students who grew up \nin the Ramallah area stay at home while attending university (c.f. Holdsworth 2006), my \nresearch focused on students who rented accommodation in Birzeit. In order to \nunderstand these students\u201f mobilities between their homes, their rental accommodation \nand the university, it\u201fs important to first understand how home is defined by these \nstudents. Unlike the students Kenyon (1999) interviewed in England, who imagined their \nuniversity accommodation as a transitional home between parental and future homes, \nuniversity students who were renting accommodation in Birzeit do not consider their \nlodgings to be a home space. Home is instead located in the balad (their village of \norigin), the place where they grew up and where their family lives.  \n \nJalaal: I look at home as the place I was born in, and the place that I have family \nin. It will always connect me to my brothers and sisters. When there are holidays \nor some religious occasions, we all go to that house and meet again. It gives you a \n 15 \ngood chance to remember when you were a child, when you used to work around \nthe house\u2026 It reminds me of my childhood, which was the best period of my life \ntill now.    \n(Male student, interview conducted on 19th April 2006, in English). \n \nYacob: The first thing is stability. The social moorings of your life. You feel \nrelaxed. You feel like a human being. You feel like a member of society. It\u201fs the \nplace where you live your life, where you pray, where you can experience your \nown values, culture and traditions. You think about the place where you grew up. \n(Male student, interview conducted on 22nd May 2006, in Arabic and English). \n \nThese definitions of home fit within more broadly held notions of home that I \nencountered as I talked with other members of Birzeit society, which constructed home as \na simultaneously material space (baladi, village of origin) imbued with familial and \nemotional ties. Most of the students I talked to who rented accommodation while \nstudying at Birzeit, preferred to live at home. \n \nOsama: My home in Hebron has more going for it than my lodging here. The \ndifference is that no one likes to live as a stranger. At home in Hebron, my clothes \nare cleaned for me, my food is prepared, it\u201fs very relaxing there. There\u201fs no work. \nBut here I need to wash, cook, clean. I need to do everything in the house, all the \nchores. This is the advantage of living in Hebron as opposed to living here. The \nadvantage of living here is that I\u201fm able to make more connections with people \nfrom other villages, and learn about responsibility. Living here teaches me how to \nlook after myself and be responsible for myself. \n(Male student, interview conducted on 29\nth\n April 2006, in English and Arabic). \n \nRasha: I miss my mother, especially when I\u201fm hungry\u2026 And my father when I \ndon\u201ft have money [laughs]. \nTania: She\u201fs [Rasha] a good cook, but she likes her mother\u201fs cooking more than \nher own. \n 16 \n(Female students, interview conducted on 4\nth\n May 2006, in English). \n \nThese ideas are very similar to Morris\u201f (1996: 386) understanding of home as neither \norigin nor destination, but rather being \u201ein the middle of things\u2026 a way of going \noutside\u201f, (see also Blunt & Dowling 2006). Yacob expresses a similar idea when he uses \nthe word moorings (see Urry 2003), which emphasizes how home allows the other \nmovements of his life (praying, experiencing culture, etc) to occur. This understanding of \nhome as somewhere to venture from and return to manifests itself in the desire that many \nstudents have to travel home regularly, which some are able to do. Osama, who comes \nfrom a village near Hebron, told me he visits home every three to four weeks, which is \nmore frequently that in previous years because he is bored of Birzeit and his brother now \ndrives up to Ramallah on business so he is able to catch a ride home. This allows him to \nsave a great deal of the money he would have to spend on services - communal taxis that \nnearly every student (and indeed most other Palestinians) use to travel between towns, \nvillages and checkpoints in the West Bank. Tania, from Tulkarem, and Rasha, from \nNablus, both use services to visit their families every two weeks, despite the fact that in \nTania\u201fs case the journey can last anywhere between two and six hours, depending on how \nmany barriers to movement are encountered\nv\n. \n \nTania: It varies. Sometimes five hours, four hours. In the worst case, six hours. In \nthe best case, about eighty minutes. \n(Female student, interview conducted on 4\nth\n May 2006, in English). \n \nStudents make sense of the relative immobility these barriers cause when traveling \nbetween their home and the university in two ways. The first way is through a more \ntemporal understanding. In Tania\u201fs case, her experiences of im\/mobility are related to the \ndifferent repetitions of the journey she makes every two weeks, and the different times \nthis journey takes. She understands and explains her relative immobility through \nreference to other temporal frames \u2013 such as the best case (\u201eeighty minutes\u201f) or the worst \ncase (\u201esix hours\u201f) \u2013 or what I will call an \u201eelse when\u201f. Many other students used the \n 17 \nbeginning of the Al Aqsa Intifada (in September 2000) to indicate a temporal rupture, \nseparating a time of relative mobility from a subsequent time of relative immobility. \n \nThe second way immobility is understood is spatially, as in the following example with \nJalaal, who is not able to make frequent visits home. \n \nMe: So how often do you visit Jenin then? \n \nJalaal: Once every three or four months.  \n \nMe: Do you choose to go that often, or is it, you can only go that often because of \nthe difficulties? \n \nJalaal: It\u201fs only because of the checkpoints. There are too many checkpoints on \nthe road, especially in Jenin. Also I have a lot of studying to do. Another thing is \nthat I prefer to live in this environment. The only reason I go to Jenin is just to see \nmy parents.  \n \nMe: What do you prefer about this environment? \n \nJalaal: No checkpoints! (Laughs). No checkpoints, you can go to Ramallah at \nmidnight. In Jenin, you have to be asleep by 8 [when the checkpoint closes]. \n(Male student, interview conducted on 19th April 2006, in English). \n \nHere we can note that Jalaal\u201fs account of immobility is more spatially based, as his \nexperiences of traveling from Birzeit to Ramallah provide a more mobile contrast than \nhis experiences of traveling from Birzeit to Jenin. His immobility is understood and \nexplained in relation to an elsewhere. \n \n 18 \nHowever, while experiences of immobility can be understood relative to an elsewhere \nand an \u201eelse when\u201f, in practice they are usually experienced simultaneously. In other \nwords immobility is relative to other time-spaces. \n \nMe: When you go to Jenin [from Birzeit], you have to go through Nablus, is this \nright? \n \nJalaal: Yeah, it was this way before the Intifada. It used to take one hour. When \nyou go to Nablus and then to Jenin, it will only take you one hour. But now you \nhave to go through other roads\u2026 When I began studying at Birzeit, we used to go \nthrough Jericho. We\u201fd go to Jericho, and then we\u201fd come to Ramallah. Then we \nstarted to go through Tulkarem. [See figure 4]  \n \nMe: The opposite way. \n \nJalaal: Tulkarem, and then\u2026it was so difficult. \n \nMe: Wow. So how do you get to Jenin at the moment? \n \nJalaal: Through Tulkarem, but not the ordinary roads. We have to go through the \nfields. Roads have been established in the [olive] fields.  \n (Male student, interview conducted on 19th April 2006, in English). \n \n[INSERT FIGURE 4]. \n \nJalaal\u201fs journey is slower because of both the different routes he must take, which cover \nan ever-greater distance, and the increasing time it takes to travel these routes. The fact \nthat services now cross olive groves not only illustrates the extent of the relative \nimmobility imposed by the Israeli Occupation Forces through their control of the \nPalestinian road network, but also the creative, albeit environmentally damaging ways in \nwhich Palestinians pursue their relative mobility. Jalaal\u201fs story also illuminates some of \n 19 \nthe consequences of this relative immobility. The journey to and from home has become \nfar less routine for Jalaal, both spatially and temporally, and consequently \nunpredictability itself has become routine (c.f. Adey 2006): Jalaal told me that the Israeli \nOccupation Forces are constantly on the lookout for drivers who circumvent checkpoints, \nand hence there is always the possibility that a service driver will be caught, turned back \nand heavily fined. Unpredictability can function as another barrier to movement, as it \ndoes for Dina, a Birzeit resident. \n \nDina: We used to go to Nablus, forty-five minutes, do some shopping because Nablus is \ncheaper. Now, I wouldn\u201ft go because I would have to go through Hawara, I have \nto carry a lot of stuff and then get checked by Israelis. Maybe we stay there for \none hour or two at the checkpoint and so now we would rather stay in our area. \n(Female villager, interview conducted on 6\nth\n April 2006, in English and Arabic). \n \nThe unpredictable space-times of these contorted journeys also extract an economic cost, \nand like the journey times, the cost is also unpredictable. Osama describes his journey \nfrom Birzeit to his village in Hebron: \n \nOsama: From here to Ramallah. From Ramallah to Kalandia.  \n \nMe: And you go through the checkpoint? \n \nOsama: Yes. After the checkpoints there are cars [services] to either Abu Dis or \nBethlehem. I go to\u2026 Al Khader, which is a village near Bethlehem. Then from Al \nKhader there are buses that travel to the city of Hebron. Then I\u201fll take a car \n[service] from the city to my home. [See figure 5] \n\u2026 \nMe: And that takes three hours. \n \n 20 \nOsama: If there are no flying checkpoints\nvi\n, I go through five places. If there are \ncheckpoints, I\u201fll go through eight or nine places\u2026 On the normal route, there are \nfive checkpoints.  \n \nMe: How long does it take if there are flying checkpoints? \n \nOsama: Five and a half hours. Can you imagine coming and going every week? \nDo you want to know about the cost: forty or fifty shekels\nvii\n [approx. US $10-12]. \nAnd sometimes seventy, sometimes one hundred [approx. US $25], if there are \nmany checkpoints. The Israeli Occupation plays a role in this situation.  \n(Male student, interview conducted on 29\nth\n April 2006, in English and Arabic). \n \n[INSERT FIGURE 5]. \n \nOsama\u201fs question, \u201ecan you imagine coming and going every week\u201f, is a rhetorical one, \nsince most people cope with the predictably unpredictable time-spaces of relative \nimmobility between home and university by simply making the trip far less frequently, \nlike Jalaal. However, as I mentioned earlier, Osama suggested that he now travels home \nmore often because he is bored of Birzeit. I make this point to stress that while the Israeli \nOccupation barriers heavily impact the relative immobility of students, there are also \nother (non-Occupation) factors that determine each student\u201fs movement. In practice, it is \nvery difficult to separate the different determining factors\nviii\n. \n \nAccommodating Students: Constructing Birzeit as Place \n \nSome of these differential and relational student mobilities that I have examined affect \nnot only the students who experience them, but also \u2013 economically, ecologically, \nmaterially and socially \u2013 Birzeit as place. I now want to trace how these journeys to and \nfrom the University, and to and from home also have very particular consequences for the \nvillage of Birzeit and the villagers. The most obvious way in which these relative \n 21 \nimmobilities between university and home manifest themselves in Birzeit village is \nthrough the demand for rental accommodation. Greater movement restrictions have \nled\/forced students to live closer to the university. As the earlier quote from Anais \nsuggests, the demand for lodgings has placed considerable pressure on the village, \nparticularly since the outbreak of the Al Aqsa Intifada in 2000.  \n \nThis increased demand for living space has affected a number of transformations in the \nmaterial fabric of the village. During the 1980s the university campus relocated to a new \nsite in an area known as Il Majj, on the edge of the village that borders with the \nneighbouring village of Abu Kash. Since the campus\u201f move, a number of large apartment \nbuildings have been constructed around the \u201enew\u201f campus in Il Majj. The new apartment \nbuildings in Il Majj, which house migrants working in Ramallah as well as students, are \nbeing built on land considered the most fertile in the village (due to natural water \nsprings). While this shift from a farm based to property based economy may be profitable \nfor some villagers, the loss of agricultural land is of serious concern\nix\n. The movement of \nthe campus and student accommodation within Birzeit has also led some villagers who \nown businesses in the older parts of town (near the site of the \u201eold\u201f campus) to complain \nthat students no longer visit their coffee shops, restaurants and shops because they don\u201ft \nlive near enough them.  \n \nAhmad: In the eighties and before, the university was amongst the buildings in the \nvillage. You can find prosperity in the village, cafeterias all around, people \nwalking till midnight, students [walking] till midnight\u2026 The minute they started \nmoving to the other spot, building, it killed the village. \n(Male villager, interview conducted on 12\nth\n February 2006, in English). \n \nWhile the number of students renting accommodation in Birzeit has increased, \ncomplaints like Ahmad\u201fs, that the students are now \u201emixing\u201f less with villagers than in \nthe past, are frequent. This is another consequence of students\u201f daily mobility routines. \nMost students (unlike Khader) suggested they preferred to spend as much time as \npossible at the university. Aside from lectures, the campus (as anyone who visits will \n 22 \nnotice) affords a greater range of social opportunities compared with both their lodgings \nand their balad. This is particularly true with regards to the ability to interact with \nmembers of the opposite sex, which is strictly regulated in most other social venues, but, \ndue to the nature of mixed gender classes\nx\n and the university\u201fs liberal ethosxi, tacitly \npromoted in the social space of the university. After the campus closes at 4pm, students \nrenting accommodation in Birzeit will return to the village (although this can often be \ndelayed by a trip to Ramallah), and evenings can be spent studying or relaxing in their \nlodgings. \n \nTawfiq: We were all friends and there was no time to study. It was all laughing \nand talking. Forget reading! \n(Male student, interview conducted on 8\nth\n April 2006, in English and Arabic). \n \nOsama: I mean, when friends live with each other, it\u201fs all laughter, playing chess, \ntalking\u2026 I didn\u201ft use to smoke, but after I came here I started. I\u201fm addicted. \n(Male student, interview conducted on 29\nth\n April 2006, in English and Arabic). \n \nStudents\u201f rootedness in their flats or houses can be understood as one source of villagers\u201f \ncomplaints that many students no longer frequent places such as restaurants and coffee \nshops and provide them with custom, as they reputedly did prior to the relocation of the \ncampus. However, my participant observation suggested that the relative poverty of \nstudents since the outbreak of the Al Aqsa Intifada also played a determining role. This \npoverty was accentuated during my fieldwork in 2006, after the international economic \nboycott following the election of Hamas to head the Palestinian Legislative Council \n(PLC). At this time many students (and by implication their families) weren\u201ft even able \nto afford the university tuition, leading to a heavily scaled back group of course offerings \nand the non-payment of the entire university staff\u201fs wages. During this crisis landlords in \nBirzeit also complained that rent was frequently either partially or totally unpaid, which \nbuilt on more longstanding complaints that students don\u201ft take care of the properties they \nare renting. \n \n 23 \nTarek: Before I used to rent the apartment for 180JD [Jordanian Dinars, or \napprox. US $250], regardless of how many people were in it. I had to get 180JD \nat the end of the month. But now each student has to pay for himself, like 50JD \n[approx. US $70], and he won\u201ft care about the other person who doesn\u201ft have \nmoney. He\u201fll just pay his share of the rent. So I can\u201ft work like that, because \nsome people have their rent money and others don\u201ft.  \n\u2026 \nI was thinking about building another building for students, but now, why should \nI? You even have to fix stuff after the students leave, because they wreck \neverything, so it\u201fs a bad investment. You need 15000 dollars to fix stuff after the \nstudents leave. \n(Male villager, interview conducted on 25\nth\n June 2006, in Arabic). \n \nLaila: There are girls upstairs. Girls are really tough to deal with these days too. \nThey don\u201ft clean anything. I don\u201ft know how they live like that. They are from \nJenin and Tulkaren. And before that the Beit Sahur girls - they\u201fre disgusting. \nThey didn\u201ft clean and they were dirty. It costs me more to repair the house than I \ntake in rent. \n(Female villager, interview conducted on 30\nth\n April 2006, in Arabic). \n \nOne Birzeiti complained to me that students even stole her family\u201fs patio furniture. The \nmayor of Birzeit, a former lecturer at the university who in his current office is trying to \nfind solutions to the conflict between landlords and tenants, suggests that while the \nlandlords\u201f complaints are often valid, they are often at fault too. \n \nNasser: The landlords are not that benevolent either. Sometimes they put \napartments on the market that are not suitable for habitation, kitchens are not \nproperly functioning, toilets are not properly functioning. The place is a dump and \nthey want to charge an arm and a leg for it. And the excuse of the landlords is, \nthey run away without paying, what do they expect.  \n(Male villager, interview conducted on 16\nth\n August 2006, in English). \n 24 \n \nWhile these problems may be germane to short-term renting everywhere, in Birzeit I \nargue that they can be viewed as a consequence of student im\/mobilities between their \nrental accommodation in Birzeit and home (balad). As I have suggested, rather than the \ntransitional role that university \u201edigs\u201f provide for students in Britain as they move out of \ntheir parents\u201f homes and into their own after university (Kenyon 1999), student \naccommodation in Birzeit functions more like a lodging which they stay in while \nattending university. Hence what one person (the landlord) often considers a home, is \ntreated as just a living space by other people (students). While residents of Birzeit may \nappreciate the business that students bring, in this instance the students\u201f mobility or lack \nof rootedness (Hannan et al 2006) leads to a series of tensions that literally take place \nthrough the conditions of living spaces that are rented and the (non-)payment of rent. \nThis also creates a situation in which these Birzeit University students, who otherwise \nexperience manifold relative immobilities, are also simultaneously more mobile (in their \nliving arrangements) than other village residents, and for this reason are partially out of \nplace (Cresswell 1996). Many students suggested during informal conversations that if \ntraveling through the West Bank was easier and quicker, they would live at home and \ncommute to university as was done in the past (prior to the start of the Al Aqsa Intifada in \n2000) and as students who live in the Ramallah region still do. Perhaps most importantly \nthis would keep them \u201ein place\u201f (Cresswell 1996) by keeping them in \u201etheir\u201f village. This \nunsettling effect is further compounded by a number of students who, after graduation, \nremain in Birzeit or the broader Ramallah region. \n \nSamir: I consider the whole of Palestine my home. When I was a child, my father \ntaught me that the land was very beautiful and I should love all the land. So I love \nall of Palestine, and I don\u201ft care if I live in Jerusalem, Jenin or Tulkarem. It\u201fs all \nmy home. I can learn to adapt to anything and live with anyone, and treat it like \nhome. Of course Tulkarem is my home, where I can return. It\u201fs beautiful \nmemories, where I spent my childhood and I miss it a lot. I love it a lot. If I didn\u201ft \nhave one I would be no one, but in the end I will adapt my life. \n(Male immigrant, interview conducted on 22nd August 2006, in Arabic). \n 25 \n \nWejdan: The people who are originally from Birzeit are the majority, but if you \nwant to look at Birzeit as a whole, there are now strangers who are living here \nwho call themselves Birzeitis, but they are not Birzeitis. Like maybe a student at \nthe university will get married, work in Ramallah and they\u201fll stay here. \n\u2026 \nHana: Before you were walking in the street and every second you would say hi \nto someone you knew, and you knew him pretty well. But now sometimes you see \npeople who you\u201fve never seen before. So it\u201fs a bit different you know.  \n\u2026 \nDina: You know sometimes it\u201fs hard to cope because even if they\u201fre Arabs and \nfrom Palestine but from different regions, they come from a different background, \nthey\u201fre not the same. \n(Male and female villagers, interview conducted on 6\nth\n April 2006, in English and \nArabic). \n \nThe frictions stemming from the differential mobility of students vis a vis other residents \nof Birzeit challenge a sedentary equation of home as balad. This unsettling can be traced \nin diverging meanings of baladi, to mean both my place (village of origin) and my \nnation, a linguistic marker of the movement away from village life to a large imagined \ncommunity. Students\/immigrants like Samir are able to blur the line between these two \nmeanings. However although these student-migrants are from the same nation, some \nvillagers such as Dina still script them as \u201eother\u201f as if they were transnational migrants \nfrom another nation (Ahmed et al 2003, Pratt 2004). This process of othering is built on a \nless ambiguous use of balad to mean either village of origin or nation, which maintains \nrather than deconstructs the distinction between these two spatial scales. This tension \nbetween villagers and those they construct as \u201eoutsiders\u201f is one example of the agonistic \nand antagonistic processes that continually make Birzeit as place. Massey (2005) uses the \nterm \u201ethrowntogetherness\u201f to describe the event of place and the political process it \nembodies. While Massey uses this term to talk about place ontologically, using this \nspecific phrase in the context of Palestine, where some people throw and others are \n 26 \nthrown, runs the risk of sounding studiously neutral and down playing the unequal power \nrelations that have constituted the historical and geographical trajectories that intermingle \nto create this place\nxii\n. As Kraftl & Adey (2008) note, there are a number of practices and \nprocesses, such as architecture, that determine quite forcefully what gets thrown together, \nincluding the geopolitical processes that I touched on earlier in the paper. Many people \nare moving and\/or staying Ramallah because of the closures that have affected cities like \nJenin, Tulkarem and Al Khalil (Hebron) in other parts of Palestine, forcing people to \nmove to the relatively prosperous centre where the Palestinian ministries are located, and \npeople can still do business (Taraki & Giacaman 2006). \n \nConclusion: Future Mobilities? \n \nThis paper has stressed the importance of studying relative immobilities by arguing that \nstudent mobilities in the West Bank are heavily impacted by barriers, imposed by the \nIsraeli Occupation, specifically designed to render these students (and other Palestinians) \nless mobile. These im\/mobilities also affect the village of Birzeit, through property that is \nuncared for and damaged, rents that are unpaid, and disruptions to hegemonic \nimaginations of place. The immobilities students experience are relative not just to other \npeoples\u201f mobility (e.g. Israeli settlers), but also to prior experiences of mobility (an \u201eelse \nwhen\u201f) and to experiences of mobility in other spaces (an else where). Students \nexperience the brute fact of their relative immobility through barriers that are material \n(checkpoints), legal-bureaucratic (the ID and permit system) and imaginative (e.g. \nKhader) in nature. These immobilities and barriers are constituted, albeit asymmetrically, \nthrough the ongoing practices of both state and non-state actors - including the students \nthemselves.  \n \nI also argued at the outset that the relative immobility of Palestinians moving through the \nWest Bank has become an important site of political contestation. High-level diplomatic \nnegotiations frequently include demands that the Israeli state should reduce or remove \nbarriers to movement\nxiii\n. This geopolitics of im\/mobility is intimately tied to the more \neveryday micropolitical activities. On the one hand there are the activities of human \n 27 \nrights organizations (B\u201fTselem), activist groups (Machsom Watch) and Birzeit \nUniversity\u201fs own \u201eRight to Education Campaign\u201f that monitor and discursively challenge \nmaterial occurrences of immobility. However, the performances of mobility enacted by \nstudents tend to respond more pragmatically rather than morally\/ethically to the \nrestrictions on movement. In other words, students tend to travel less, and consequently \nstay in Birzeit (and Ramallah) more. This has also contributed to a series of tensions \nbetween students and villagers (particularly landlords) due to the differing ways in which \nthey make place. These tensions are one milieu in which a micropolitics of im\/mobility \nemerges (Connolly 2002, 2005) as more sedentary notions of home (as balad) are \nagonistically challenged and in some cases redefined by students who continue to live in \nBirzeit after they have completed their tertiary education. Since Ramallah is the most \nprosperous city in the West Bank, or as one Palestinian friend put it to me the least \ndeprived, the relatively greater number of jobs encourages graduates to remain in the area \n(Taraki 2008). This influx of graduates and other work migrants is intertwined with the \nclosure of other cities throughout the West Bank, and Ramallah\u201fs development as the de \nfacto political capital of Palestine (Taraki & Giacaman 2006). The conflicts that I witness \nin Birzeit over notions of being in\/out of place, which are tied intimately to definitions of \nhome and mobility, seem to be occurring across the Ramallah region. \n \nAnother point of contact between a politics and micropolitics of im\/mobility occurs when \ngraduates use their education to make themselves relatively more mobile, and seek work \nabroad in Dubai (e.g. Jalaal and Osama) or America (e.g. Tania). By November 2006, \nfifty thousand Palestinians had applied to foreign consulates to emigrate from Palestine, a \nform of mobility described by Israeli demographer Arnon Sofer as \u201evoluntary transfer\u201f \n(Makdisi 2008: 8-10). I hope it is clear after reading this paper that Sofer\u201fs description \ncompletely ignores (among other things) the types of relative immobility that I have \ndiscussed in this paper, which actively encourage Palestinians to leave. In other words, \nthe quotidian micropolitics of mobility practiced by Palestinians - both students and \nothers - in response to the geopolitical and micropolitical practices of immobility \nenforced by the Israeli Occupation Forces, has led to more extensive migration towards \nRamallah and emigration abroad that both contest and avoid the Israeli Occupation \n 28 \nForces\u201f efforts to immobilize the Palestinian population in the West Bank or encourage \nthem to leave. This point emphasizes once again why it is vitally important to account for \nthese immobilities. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nI wish to thank all the students and residents of Birzeit who helped me with my research, \nJohn Barker and Peter Kraftl for their extremely helpful comments on various drafts of \nthis work and their hard work and patience as editors, Alice Campbell for comments, and \nthe anonymous reviewer who generously provided a very detailed and useful \ncommentary. Thanks also to Eric Leinberger for his assistance in producing the maps. \n \nNotes  \n                                                 \ni\n Pseudonyms are used for all interviewees. I have also indicated whether the interviewee \nis a student or a villager (or both), and their gender for readers unfamiliar with Arabic \nnames. \nii\n When viewing maps in this paper, it is vital to remember that these static cartographic \nrepresentations really do struggle to represent the fluid spaces of im\/mobility in the West \nBank, particularly barriers like flying checkpoints and the different routes service drivers \ntake, sometimes on a daily basis, when traveling from place to place. This is reflected in \nthe fact that the UN OCHA, which produced the base maps, update them every six \nmonths. \niii\n Palestinians also face a range of related but different problems moving outside the West \nBank, but this lies outside the scope of this paper. See Weizman 2007, Barghouti 2000. \niv\n Khader told me that such summonses are issued when someone is accused of doing \nsomething for which there is no evidence. He asserted that any accusations against him \nare not only false, but also not very serious, a claim he backed up by stating that three \nsummons were given to him in person, when he could just as easily have been arrested. \nv\n While I was only able to interview a few women, it seemed as though female students \nvisited home more frequently than their male counterparts, perhaps because of gender \nideals that locate women in the space of the house. I would also suggest from observation \nthat women are seen as less threatening by the Israeli Occupation Forces and therefore \nable to travel with less scrutiny. For instance, larger checkpoints, such as Kalandia and \nHuwara, have separate aisles for women. \nvi\n A flying checkpoint is an impermanent one, and usually consists of an army jeep \nparked in the middle of the road, with Israeli soldiers slowing down or stopping traffic. If \nknown about in advance, Palestinians may take alternate routes to avoid these \n 29 \n                                                                                                                                                 \ncheckpoints, although as Osama suggests (\u201eeight or nine places\u201f), this is usually involves \na much more circuitous journey. \nvii\n Israeli Shekels, Jordanian Dinars and US Dollars are all used as currency through out \nthe West Bank; the first two because of the Jordanian (1948-1967) and Israeli (since \n1967) occupations, and the last one because dollars are considered a much more stable \ncurrency than shekels. \nviii\n While I did not explicitly research methods of coping on the journeys themselves, I did \nnotice during trips I made through the West Bank the frequent use of mobile phones, and \na system of hand gestures between taxi drivers are used to communicate the location and \nrelative speed\/slowness of Israeli checkpoints. These forms of coping gesture at a highly \nadaptive, embodied, (and specific) knowledge economy, although more research needs to \nbe done to delineate this area (Hammami 2004). \nix\n Interview with Nasser (Mayor of Birzeit), conducted on 16\nth\n August 2006, in English. \nAgricultural land is in particularly short supply because a great deal of Israeli \ncolonization since 1948 has stolen fertile agricultural land, which has obvious \nconsequences for indigenous food provision. \nx\n Most secondary schools in Palestine are gender specific. \nxi\n See for example the University\u201fs mission statement: \u201cThe University is committed to \nexcellence and encourages creativity, experimentation, innovation, accomplishment as \nwell as team work and democratic practices anchored in pluralism, freedom of expression \nand respect for others. The University endeavors to excel in higher education, scientific \nresearch, and service to the community. Since its establishment, the University has \nremained committed to providing equal learning opportunities to qualified individuals \nand to prepare students to become good citizens active in their society and committed to \nits advancement and well-being. The University provides the appropriate environment for \nstudents to develop their personalities and realize their potentials in an open and liberal \natmosphere that stresses the Arab-Islamic heritage\u201d. (Birzeit University 2007c) \nxii\n This point ties in with my earlier observation that studies in the new mobilities \nparadigm focus to a much greater extent on the relatively mobile. \nxiii\n For instance, just as I have finished writing this paper, Tony Blair has announced the \nremoval of four roadblocks.
