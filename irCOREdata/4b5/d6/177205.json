In general practice in England expenditure\nwas \u00a3233m (\u20ac274m; US$386m) in 2007.4 Laparo-\nscopic fundoplication is now an alternative way to\ntreat GORD. In addition to potential clinical benefits\nlaparoscopic surgery should lead to the avoidance of\ncontinual medication and its associated costs. Several\nstudies have examined economic characteristics of\nlaparoscopic surgery.5-8 Of those that compared sur-\ngery with GORD medication, Bojke8 found that sur-\ngery was cost effective, and Cookson6 concluded that\nlaparoscopic surgery had similar costs tomedicalman-\nagement after eight years and was cost saving there-\nafter. Arguedas evaluated the strategies in a United\nStates setting and concluded that medical therapy\ndominated surgery using a 10 year time horizon,\nassuming a higher rate of symptom recurrence and\nre-operation after surgery than in the surgery groups\nin the UK based studies.5 None of these studies, how-\never, used estimates of health related quality of life\nderived from a randomised clinical trial comparing\nlaparoscopic fundoplication with medical manage-\nment, which is of central importance to the evaluation\nof these treatments. This paper updates the economic\nstudy by Bojke8 to incorporate one year health related\nquality of life data from the REFLUX trial.9\nThe multicentre REFLUX trial compared a strategy\nof laparoscopic surgery with one of continued medical\nmanagement for patients with reasonable symptom\ncontrol on GORD medications.9 The clinical and\npatient assessed outcomes of the trial up to one year\nafter surgery have recently been reported. Although\nthese findings showed clear benefits of surgery at this\ntime in terms of health related quality of life, decision\nmakers are also interested in the costs and cost effec-\ntiveness of the two forms of management. GORD is\nusually a chronic condition and a key issue is the extent\n1Centre for Health Economics,\nUniversity of York, Heslington, York\nYO1 5DD\n2Faculty of Economics and\nBusiness Sciences, Campus\nUniversitario de la Cartuja, 18071\nGranada, Spain\nCorrespondence to: L Bojke\nlg116@york.ac.uk\nCite this as: BMJ 2009;338:b2576\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.b2576\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 7\nto which benefits are sustained. Surgery is costly in the\nshort term, but these costs may be at least partly offset\nby reductions in lifetime use of GORD medication.\nExtrapolation of health benefits and costs are thus\nneeded to provide a meaningful estimate of cost effec-\ntiveness.\nMETHODS\nOverview\nWeused amodel comparing laparoscopic surgery and\ncontinued use of proton pump inhibitors in male\npatients aged 45 (the median age and predominant\nsex in the REFLUX trial9), and stable on anti-GORD\nmedication. Over a lifetime horizon, health benefits\nwere quantified in terms of quality adjusted life years\nand costs were assessed from the perspective of the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s NHS in 2008\/2009 prices. Future\ncosts and health benefits are discounted (adjusted to\ncurrent values) at 3.5% per year, in accord with UK\nguidelines for economic evaluation.10\nModel structure\nFigure 1 shows themodel structure. It is a discrete time\nMarkov cohort model with a cycle length of one year.\nPatients follow a strategy of either early laparoscopic\nsurgery or continuation ofmedicalmanagement (with-\nout the option of surgery after failure of medical man-\nagement).\nIn the model, surgery may \u201cfail\u201d in one of two ways.\nPatients may need revision of surgery, either to\nimprove symptom control or because of surgical com-\nplications, or theymay return to use of long termmed-\nical management because of continued symptoms.11\nThis model assumes that patients in the medical\nmanagement arm are stable on GORD medication.\nThis assumption follows the inclusion criteria for the\nREFLUX trial. As a result \u201ctreatment failure\u201d is not\ndefined as a health state in the model. Annual costs of\nmedical management are estimated using mean con-\nsumption of proton pump inhibitors during the\nREFLUX trial, incorporating any changes to dose or\nmedication, and it is assumed that the estimate of\nhealth related quality of life includes, on average,\nremission or any side effects of medication. The base\ncase assumes that, if surgical patients do not need to\nreturn to medical management or need revision of\nsurgery, the relative difference in health related quality\nof life of surgery over medical management will be\nmaintainedover their lifetime.Weused sensitivity ana-\nlyses to consider other scenarios where the treatment\neffect (the difference in health related quality of life\nbetween medical management and those who do not\nfail surgery) only lasts for one, two, or five years. In\nthese alternative scenarios, health related quality of\nlife is the same in the surgery group as in the medical\nmanagement group after the \u201ctreatment effect\u201d ends,\neven in patients who do not return to the use of proton\npump inhibitors.\nEvidence used in the model\nCosts for the first year in the model were estimated\nfrom the REFLUX trial.9 The trial collected data on\nuse of health service resources up to one year, includ-\ning inpatient days in hospital wards and high depen-\ndency units, diagnostic tests, duration in theatre,\noutpatient and general practitioner visits, re-admis-\nsions, and use of GORD medication. These resources\nwere costed using routine NHS unit costs and prices\n(table 1).\nWe calculated rates of return to medical manage-\nment and revision of surgery using data from the\nREFLUX trial and studies identified through a litera-\nture search.8 12 The average rate of return to medical\nmanagement overall was 4.9 per 100 person years\nand the average rate of revision of surgery was 0.8\nper 100 person years, although rates seemed to vary\nconsiderably between studies. As we did not find evi-\ndence that this variationwas related to length of follow-\nup, we assumed that the annual rate of surgical failure\nwas constant over time. Details of the literature\nsearches and meta-analyses are available in the Health\nTechnology Assessment monograph.12 Sensitivity\nanalyses were undertaken assuming higher and lower\nrates of failure.\nAfter the first year, all patients require an annual visit\nto their general practitioner. It was assumed that\npatients who fail surgery need an additional visit to\ntheir general practitioner and to a hospital specialist.\nNo hospital admissions or outpatient visits for\nGORD related reasons were included after one year\nfor patients with successful surgery.13\nPatients can die of other causes,14 and the model\nassumed the same age and sex specific risk of mortality\nas the UK general population. Although no deaths\nfrom surgery or revision occurred in the REFLUX\ntrial, a small additional risk of operative mortality was\nassumed, estimated by a meta-analysis (four deaths in\n4000 procedures).8\nEstimating quality adjusted life years\nThe REFLUX trial measured health status using the\ngenericEuroQolEQ-5D instrument.15 Eachof the pos-\nsible 243 health states was mapped to a preference\nbased value (or \u201cutility\u201d) where zero represents a state\nequivalent to death and one represents full health.16\nTable 1 shows the mean differences in utility between\ntreatments at one year estimated by the REFLUX\nTreatment decision\nMedical management\nRe-operateMedical management\nSurgery\nDie, any cause Die, any cause\nFig 1 | Model structure\nRESEARCH\npage 2 of 7 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\ntrial.12 No other randomised trials have compared sur-\ngery with medication using a preference based mea-\nsure of health related quality of life.\nWe assumed that the \u201cadjusted treatment received\u201d\nanalysis of the REFLUX trial12 was the most appropri-\nate measure of the effect of surgery on health related\nquality of life to use in the base case model. This\napproach identifies the efficacy of surgery in patients\nwho are most likely to comply with their clinicians\u2019\nrecommendations for treatment.17 18 We also used\nintention to treat and per protocol estimates in sensitiv-\nity analyses.\nIn the model, we use the term \u201ctreatment effect\u201d to\nrefer to the difference in health related quality of life\nbetween medical management and those who do not\nfail surgery. This value differs from the estimates calcu-\nlated in the trial, which measured the mean difference\nin health related quality of life between medical man-\nagement and surgery, whether failed or not. As those\nwho fail surgery would be expected to have lower\nhealth related quality of life than those who do not,\nthis approach estimates a lower bound for the benefits\nof surgery by the model.\nWe estimated the health related quality of life of the\n15 patients in the surgery group of the REFLUX trial\nwho required proton pump inhibitors at one year to be\n0.68 (standard error 0.048) using the EQ5D, a decrease\nof 0.04 from baseline. In view of the small sample of\npatients and short follow-up, it was assumed in the base\ncase analysis that patients who needed proton pump\ninhibitors after surgery returned to their baseline\n(pre-surgery) health related quality of life, consistent\nwith clinical opinion (Robert Heading, personal com-\nmunication, 2008) that proton pump inhibitors are just\nas effective after surgery as before, provided they are\nbeing used to treat reflux symptoms. This assumption\nwas varied in sensitivity analysis.\nTo account for the decline in health related quality of\nlife with age, the mean utility for medical management\nobserved at the end of the REFLUX trial was com-\npared with the average utility for the general popula-\ntion aged 45-5519 to calculate a proportionate\ndecrement in utility for that health state. It was\nassumed that this proportionate decrement was con-\nstant as the cohort aged (table 1).\nAnalysis\nWe did calculations using Excel. The model estimated\nmean costs and quality adjusted life years in each treat-\nment cohort. Where one treatment did not dominate\nthe other, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was\ncalculated as the ratio of the difference in expected\ncosts to the difference in expected quality adjusted\nlife years. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was\ndone by assigning probability distributions to the\nmodel inputs, rather than treating them as point\nestimates.20 This analysis calculated the overall uncer-\ntainty in the treatment decision as the proportion of\nsimulations where laparoscopic surgery is cost effec-\ntive, given threshold values for the incremental cost-\neffectiveness ratio of \u00a320 000 and \u00a330 000 per quality\nTable 1 | Health related quality of life (HRQOL) estimates and rates of events used in model\nParameter Mean (SE)* Distribution for PSA Source\nHRQOL\nHRQOL while on medical management,\nor return to medical management\n0.711 (0.018) Gamma\u2020 Baseline EQ5D of patients\nrandomised in REFLUX trial12\nAdditional HRQOL after successful laparoscopic\nsurgery compared with medical management\nAdjusted treatment received\u2021 0.068 (0.038) Normal REFLUX12\nIntention to treat\u00a7 0.047 (0.026) Normal REFLUX12\nPer protocol\u00b6 0.076 (0.028) Normal REFLUX12\nHRQOL for general male population\nAged 45-55 0.84 Kind 199919\nAged 55-65 0.78 Kind 199919\nAged 65-75 0.78 Kind 199919\nAged 75+ 0.75 Kind 199919\nRates of events\nReturn to medical management after surgery 460 events,\n9389 patient years\nGamma Meta-analysis12\nRevision of surgery 53 events,\n6720 patient years\nGamma Meta-analysis12\nOperative mortality 4 deaths, 3397 patients Beta Meta-analysis8\nSE=standard error, PSA=probabilistic sensitivity analysis.\n*Unless otherwise indicated.\n\u2021Adjusted treatment received is estimated by linear model using treatment received indicator variable as a covariable.

Total costs\nwere \u00a3370 per patient in the medical management\narm and \u00a32709 in the surgical arm, a difference of\n\u00a32339 (95% confidence interval 2147 to 2558; calcu-\nlated with bias corrected accelerated bootstrap). 21\nUnder base case assumptions, the model predicts\nthat, for example, by five years 17.7% of surgery\npatients will have returned to medical management,\n2.9% will have undergone a re-operation, and 0.1%\nwill have died during surgery. The average discounted\nlifetime cost per patient of surgerywas \u00a35026,made up\nof the initial cost of the cost of surgery (\u00a32132), repair of\nsurgery (\u00a3746), return tomedicalmanagement (\u00a31360)\nand other health care (\u00a3788). The discounted lifetime\ncost of the medical management group was \u00a33411.\nTherefore, surgery had an additional mean cost of\n\u00a31616. The mean difference in quality adjusted life\nyears was 0.61, equating to an incremental cost effec-\ntiveness ratio of \u00a32648 per quality adjusted life year\n(table 3, scenario 1). In the base case, the probability\nthat surgery is cost effective at a cost effectiveness\nthreshold of \u00a320 000 is 0.94.\nWe explored several scenarios regarding the size\nand duration of treatment effect, GORD symptoms\nof those who fail surgery and costs (table 3). Use of\nintention \u2013to treat and per protocol estimates of effect\ndid not change the conclusion that surgery is cost effec-\ntive assuming a threshold of \u00a320 000 per quality\nadjusted life year gained. The probability that surgery\nis cost effective decreases to 0.77 if patients who return\nto proton pump inhibitors have worse GORD symp-\ntoms than before surgery (scenario 7). Surgery is unli-\nkely to be cost effective if it is assumed that its benefits\n(in termsof health related quality of life relative tomed-\nical management) are notmaintained beyond one year\n(scenario 4).\nSurgerymight also not be cost effective in somemul-\ntivariate sensitivity analyses. For example, the incre-\nmental cost effectiveness ratio increases to about\n\u00a322 000 if proton pump inhibitors can be effectively\ndelivered at half the cost estimated here\u2014perhaps\ndue to greater use of lower cost drugs\u2014and there is\nno difference in health related quality of life after two\nyears (scenario 16).\nDISCUSSION\nPrincipal findings\nUnder base case assumptions, surgery is cost effective\non average with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio\nof \u00a32648 per quality adjusted life year. The probability\nof surgery being cost effective is high given a threshold\nof \u00a320 000 per quality adjusted life year and assuming\nthe treatment effect lasts for at least five years and\npatients who fail surgery do not have worse symptoms\nthan before surgery.\nThe results of this analysis are similar to those of\nBojke8 who also found surgery to be cost effective.\nThat model was constructed using baseline utility\ndata from the REFLUX trial but did not include the\ntreatment effect of surgery at one year.\nStrengths and weaknesses of this study\nWe have compared the cost effectiveness of laparo-\nscopic surgery with that of medical management\nTable 2 | Mean use of healthcare resources and costs for GORD related causes in REFLUX trial12 for patients receiving their\nrandomised treatment per protocol and followed up for one year\nUnit\ncost\n(\u00a3) Source* Unit of measure\nMedical (n=155) Surgery (n=104)\nAny use\n(%)\nMean\nuse\nMean\ncost (\u00a3) SD (\u00a3)\nAny use\n(%)\nMean\nuse\nMean\ncost (\u00a3) SD (\u00a3)\nEndoscopy 172 a Tests \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 88 0.88 151 57\npH tests 64 a Tests \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 70 0.70 45 29\nManometry 61 a Tests \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 66 0.66 40 29\nOperation time 4 a Minutes \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 100 114.5 420 137\nConsumables 825 a \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 100 1.00 825 0\nWard 264 b Days \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 100 2.34 619 354\nHigh dependency 657 b Days \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1 0.05 32 322\nTotal surgery \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 2132 475\nVisit to GP 36 c Visits 44 1.16 42 71 44 1.14 42 60\nVisit from GP 58 c Visits 1 0.01 1 6 2 0.02 1 8\nOutpatient 88 b Visits 14 0.30 27 76 43 0.54 47 64\nDay case 896 b Admit 10 0.14 127 426 42 0.47 422 572\nInpatient 1259 b Admit 3 0.03 32 200 4 0.04 48 243\nSubsequent costs \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 229 632 \u2014 \u2014 560 728\nMedication costs \u2014 d \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 141 144 \u2014 \u2014 16 52\nTotal costs \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 370 638 \u2014 \u2014 2709 941\n*Sources of unit costs used in the analysis: (a) Mean unit costs of a survey of five participating centres, 2003, updated for inflation,8 (b) mean\nhospital costs for England and Wales, 2006\/07,25 (c) Curtis et al, 2008,26 (d) British National Formulary, 200924 and REFLUX.12\nRESEARCH\npage 4 of 7 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nusing randomised data on the effect of treatment on\nhealth related quality of life.\nThe REFLUX trial was a pragmatic study and the\nresults, in terms of symptom control and health related\nquality of life, are expected to be generalisable to\npatients in the UK who are stable on GORD medica-\ntion and suitable for surgery.22 Nevertheless, because\nrates of surgical reintervention and return to medical\nmanagement in clinical practice might differ from the\ntrial or with longer follow-up,23 we have used mean\nrates from a literature review to inform this analysis.\nIn the base case we used the \u201cadjusted treatment\u201d\nreceived estimate of the treatment efficacy. Intention\nto treat and per protocol estimates were also used in\nsensitivity analyses. The intention to treat analysis is\nan unbiased estimate of effectiveness but is diluted by\nthe high proportion (38%) of patients in the REFLUX\ntrial who were randomised to surgery but did not\nreceive it.12 The most common reason given for non-\ncompliance was patient choice, which was thought to\nbe affected by long waiting times.12 Given that waiting\ntimes vary between centres and over time, the inten-\ntion to treat estimate in the REFLUX trial might not\nbe generalisable to current practice in the NHS. The\nper protocol analysis adjusting for baseline age, sex,\nbodymass index, andEQ-5D score is anothermeasure\nof the efficacy of surgery12 but using regression to\nadjust for observed baseline characteristics may not\nadequately control for selection bias. Regardless of\nwhether an adjusted treatment received, intention to\ntreat or per protocol analysis is conducted, surgery\nappears to be cost effective at the thresholds used by\nNICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical\nExcellence), if it is assumed that health related quality\nof life is maintained over the long term.\nCosts of medication were calculated using current\npack prices24 applied to the prescribing pattern\nobserved in REFLUX.12 Some evidence indicates\nthat prescribers have been switching to lower cost pro-\nton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole or omepra-\nzole following sharp reductions in their prices in recent\nyears, and consequently the current cost of medical\nmanagementmaybe lower than estimatedhere.4How-\never, surgery remains cost effective even if the annual\ncost of medication is half that in the base case, other\nconsiderations being equal. Nevertheless, in some sce-\nnarios surgery is unlikely to be cost effective, particu-\nlarly where costs of medical management are lower\nthan calculated in the base case and the health related\nquality of life benefit of surgery is not maintained over\nthe long term.\nThe duration of the treatment effect is, therefore, an\nimportant but uncertain assumption. To inform this\nquestion, follow up of REFLUX trial patients has\nTable 3 | Results of base case economic model and sensitivity analyses.

Given the results of the\ntrial so far and the assumptions made in the decision\nmodel, extending the follow up of the trial from one\nyear (scenario 4) to five years (scenario 6) would\nincrease the probability that surgery is cost effective\nat a threshold of \u00a320 000 per quality adjusted life year\nfrom 0.20 to 0.88. However, under more pessimistic\nassumptions about health related quality of life of\npatients who return to medical management, then\neven five years of follow-up would still leave consider-\nable uncertainty about the value of surgery.\nConclusions\nAlthough surgery seems likely to be cost effective in\nterms of expected (mean) costs and health effects,\nuncertainty remains about the duration of the treat-\nment effect and the severity of GORD symptoms\nafter failure of surgery. Furthermore, a number of prac-\ntical issues need to be considered before the NHS\ncould offer surgery to all patients who are currently\nstable on medical management. In particular, surgical\ncapacity and availability of trained surgeons are poten-\ntial barriers to implementation that would need to be\naddressed.\nTrial team: Aberdeen\u2014Marion Campbell, Adrian Grant, Craig Ramsay,\nSamantha Wileman; York\u2014Garry Barton (1999-2002), Laura Bojke,\nDavid Epstein, Sue Macran, Mark Sculpher.
