L. Foster\n(gavin.foster@noc.soton.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe Cenozoic is a time period characterised by a gradual\ndeterioration of global climate which culminated in bipolar\ncontinental glaciation around 3 million years ago (Fig. 1;\nMudlesee and Raymo, 2005). The near accepted paradigm\ninvokes a gradual decline in pCO2 caused by enhanced sili-\ncate weathering (Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992; Raymo et al.,\n1988) as the driver for this well-documented climate change.\nReconstructing the concentration of atmospheric CO2 be-\nyond the reach of the Quaternary ice cores is, however, a\nnotoriously difficult task. Nonetheless, there is a growing\nconsensus that pCO2 did decline over the Cenozoic, but not\nexactly sympathetically with climate as the paradigm sug-\ngests (Fig. 1). This is likely because the pCO2 records are\nnot perfect (e.g. Pagani et al., 2005) and other phenomenon\nsuch as ocean circulation, continental configuration, and sur-\nface albedo (vegetation and ice coverage) also influence cli-\nmate. For instance, it has been known for some time that the\nrise and fall of mountain ranges and the formation of moun-\ntainous plateau regions on geological timescales (e.g. the Ti-\nbetan Plateau and North American Cordillera) can directly\ninfluence global climate (e.g. Ruddiman et al., 1989). So\nmuch so that it has been suggested that a reorganisation of at-\nmospheric and oceanic circulation as a direct consequence of\nglobal Late Cenozoic mountain formation may have played\nan important part in the Late Cenozoic climatic deteriora-\ntion which led to the intensification of Northern Hemisphere\nglaciation (INHG) in the Late Pliocene (Ruddiman et al.,\n1989; Mudlesee and Raymo, 2005). The importance of to-\npography was recently highlighted by DeConto et al. (2008)\nwho showed that in climate model simulations with globally\nreduced topography (half modern topography), the threshold\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n708 G.

The atmospheric concentration of CO2 (top) during this\ntime period is reconstructed using stomatal index of fossil leaves\n(blue; Ku\u00a8rschner et al., 2008; Ku\u00a8rschner et al,. 1996), the \u03b413C of\nmarine alkenones (green; Pagani et al., 1999; Pagani et al., 2009)\nand the \u03b411B of marine planktic foraminifera (red \u2013 Pearson and\nPalmer, 2000; brown \u2013 Seki et al., 2010). The threshold pCO2\nvalue necessary for sustained glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere\nis shown as a horizontal grey band (DeConto et al., 2008). Also\nshown is a record of ice rafted debris (IRD) in the North Atlantic\n(middle; ODP Site 151-909; Winkler, 1999) and the global compi-\nlation of benthic foraminifera \u03b418O of Zachos et al. (2008; bottom).\nThe vertical grey bar shows the time period when there was sus-\ntained glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere, note the sharp decline\nin \u03b418O and increase in IRD at this time. Also shown by horizon-\ntal black bands are the timing of uplift of the NW North Ameri-\ncan Cordillera as reviewed here as well as Andean (Garizone et al.,\n2008) and SE African uplift (Sepulchre et al., 2006 and references\nthere in).\npCO2 value required to trigger the INHG was lowered from\n280 ppmv to 140\u2013210 ppmv (compare their supplementary\nFig. 3 with Fig. 3 in their main paper). These general circula-\ntion model (GCM)-ice sheet model simulations confirm early\nmodelling studies (e.g. Kutzbach et al., 1989) that first docu-\nmented the importance of global topography in determining\nclimate and the potential role surface uplift may play in trig-\ngering climate change. However the approach of DeConto\net al. (2008) is rather simplistic and it is considered very\nunlikely that topography increased globally sometime in the\nLate Cenozoic (England and Molnar, 1990). Nonetheless, in\nthe last two decades, it has come to light that a relatively large\nnumber of regions underwent uplift in the Late Miocene. For\ninstance, significant surface uplift (\u223c2000m) occurred in the\nlast 10 million years in the Andes (e.g. Garizone et al., 2008).\nSimilarly, although the Tibetan plateau is thought to have re-\nmained at the same height since its inception, it gradually ex-\ntended northwards and eastwards throughout this time period\n(Rowley and Garizone, 2007). Also, Supulchre et al. (2006;\nand references there in) document regional scale uplift in\nSouthern Africa from \u223c12 Ma.\n1.1 Climatic and atmospheric influence of the North\nAmerican Cordillera\nTopography plays a particularly crucial role in controlling\nclimate over North America. General circulation models,\nrun with a much reduced orography relative to the modern,\nhighlight that without the current north-south mountain bar-\nrier to westerly atmospheric circulation that exists along the\nwest coast of the North America (herein referred to as the\nNorth American Cordillera), the winters of NE North Amer-\nican continent would be significantly warmer and the conti-\nnental interior of the US would be much wetter than today\n(Kutzbach et al., 1989; Seager et al., 2002). Indeed, contrary\nto popular belief, the relative frigidity of the winter time cli-\nmate in NE North America has more to do with the coastal\nmountains of the North American Cordillera influencing at-\nmospheric circulation than it does with the Gulf Stream pro-\nviding warmth to maritime Europe (Seager et al., 2002). In\nthe absence of the present mountain barrier, atmospheric cir-\nculation would be more or less zonal (as it is in the Southern\nHemisphere around the Antarctic continent). However, with\nthe significant mountain barrier atmospheric Rossby waves\nare generated and the jet-stream is deflected down stream of\nthe barrier stabilising a cooler polar winter air mass over NE\nNorth America (e.g. Seager et al., 2002). Broccoli and Man-\nabe (1992, 1997) also suggested that, because the tracks of\nmajor storms responsible for much of the mid-latitudes\u2019 pre-\ncipitation are parallel to the upper tropospheric jet, in the ab-\nsence of the mountain barrier moisture transport to the con-\ntinental interior would be enhanced and, consequently, the\nprairies of the continental interior would also be much wet-\nter.\n1.2 Topographic evolution of the North American\nCordillera\nIt is now relatively well established that parts, but not all, of\nthe North American Cordillera have been areas of high eleva-\ntion since their formation in the Early Cenozoic (e.g. Wolfe\net al., 1998; Horton et al., 2004; Kent-Corson et al., 2006).\nDue to the nature of North American tectonics, continental\nmaterial has been accreting to the west coast of the North\nAmerican Continent since the Jurassic (150\u2013205 Ma), with\nthe most recent major orogenic event being the Laramide\nOrogeny that climaxed at \u223c75 Ma (Burchfiel et al., 1992).\nParts of this orogenic area subsequently experienced tectonic\ncollapse initiating in the north as early as 55 Ma (Parrish et\nal., 1988) and reaching the south (central Nevada) by 35 Ma\n(Kent-Corson et al., 2006 and references therein) forming a\nnumber of large basins separated by mountain ranges (e.g.\nClim. Past, 6, 707\u2013717, 2010 www.clim-past.net\/6\/707\/2010\/\nG. L. Foster et al.: Mountain uplift and the glaciation of North America 709\nHyndman et al., 2005). The height of the ranges prior to the\nPliocene is known in a number of places from paleobotani-\ncal analysis (e.g. Wolfe et al., 1998) and through numerous\nstudies using \u03b418O based paleoaltimetry (e.g. Kent-Corson et\nal., 2006; Horton et al., 2004). These studies have been inter-\npreted as indicating that surface uplift propagated from north\n(British Columbia) to south (Nevada) from the Eocene to\nOligocene, accompanied by the development of topographic\nhighs and magmatism associated with the delamination of\nthe mantle lithosphere (Kent-Corson et al., 2006; Horton et\nal., 2004). The prevailing view is that although some Late\nCenozoic surface uplift may have occurred (e.g. see Saha-\ngian et al., 2002), the Colorado Plateau and much of the rest\nof the North American Cordillera have been long standing\nfeatures of high elevation (>2 km) and, if anything, have be-\ncome lower since the Middle Miocene. The Basin and Range\nand the Sierra Nevada have similar histories with both ranges\nbeing extant in the Miocene and either dropping in height\nsince then (Wolfe et al., 1998; Horton et al., 2004) or, for\nthe Sierra Nevada, maintaining a similar to present altitude\n(Chamberlain and Poage, 2000).\nHowever, a growing body of evidence suggests that\nthe coastal mountain ranges of the NW North American\nCordillera (i.e. the Cascades of the northwestern US, the\nCoast Range Mountains of British Columbia (BC), St Elias\nMountains of NW BC to SE Alaksa and Coast Range of\nAlaska) did indeed start to develop in the Middle to Late\nMiocene and alpine glaciation in these ranges is thought to\nhave begun at around 7\u20139 million years ago (Denton and\nArmstrong, 1969; Clague, 1991) which is likely coincident\nwith their attainment of near-present height.\nThe data pertaining to the elevation of the NW North\nAmerican Cordillera comes in three strands that will be dis-\ncussed here in turn \u2013 (i) paleobotanical and oxygen isotope\npaleoaltimetry; (ii) geological indicators of uplift, (iii) ther-\nmochronological indicators of rock uplift. The geographic\nlocations that are relevant to this evidence are highlighted in\nFig. 2.\nPaleobotanical data on Miocene-Pliocene flora (Martin\nand Rouse, 1966; Rouse and Mathews, 1979; White et\nal., 1997) has been recovered from the lee of the Alaskan\nCoast Range, St. Elias Mountains, and Coast Mountains of\nCanada (Fig. 2). These preserve evidence of both global cli-\nmatic trends, for example general Cenozoic cooling and the\nPliocene warm interval (White et al., 1997), as well as more\nregional climatic effects indicative of increased seasonality\nand more continental \u2013 colder \u2013 drier climate since 7 Ma ago\nin the lee of Alaskan and St. Elias Ranges (White et al.,\n1997) and 11 Ma in the lee of the Canadian Coast Range\n(Martin and Rouse, 1966; Rouse and Mathews, 1979), con-\nsistent with the development of a significant rain shadow at\nthis time. This view is also supported by oxygen isotope\nanalysis. Kohn et al. (2002), using fossil herbivore teeth\nfrom the Oregon Plateau (Fig. 2), show an isotopic change\nconsistent with the development of the modern topographic\n5\n40N\n50N\n60N\n70N\n160W 150W 140W 130W 120W 110W\n1\n2\n4 4 4\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n10\n11\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\u0002\n18\nO paleoaltimetry\nPaleobotanical\nGeological\nLow-T thermochron.\nFigure 2.

Oxygen data in clay minerals in paleosols in east-\nern Washington State (Fig. 2) show a similar effect beginning\nsometime after 11 Ma consistent with the development of the\nmodern \u223c1.5 km of relief at this time (Takeuchi and Larson,\n2005). In a paleosol based reconstruction of precipitation\npatterns in Oregon (Fig. 2), also in the lee of the Cascades,\nRetallack (2004) noted a drying trend initiating shortly af-\nter \u223c15 Ma. Furthermore, to the east in Nebraska, Passey\net al. (2002) note a decline in the \u03b418O of fossil equid teeth\nindicative of drying at 13-10 Ma, and in Montana and Idaho\n(Fig. 2) Kent-Corson et al. (2006) show a near synchronous\nshift in paleosol \u03b418O also thought to be related to forma-\ntion of the Cascade Mountains. In total, a number of studies\nsupport the development of the modern topographic barrier\nand associated rain shadow in the NW of the North Ameri-\ncan continent in its near entirety sometime shortly after the\nMid- to Late Miocene (i.e. after 15\u201310 Ma).\nSedimentary and volcanic deposits of Late Cenozoic age\nalso have a bearing on this problem and support these conclu-\nsions. Miocene (7\u201314 Ma) volcanic rocks erupted in part on\nrelatively level and low-relief erosion surfaces are exposed\nboth on the central plateau in Canada as well as at significant\nelevations in the St. Elias Mountains (Campbell and Dodds,\n1978) and on the east side of the southern British Columbia\nCoast Range Mountains (Parrish, 1983; Souther and Yorath,\n1992; Fig. 2). In several places, \u223c7 Ma sheets of lava have\nbeen tilted (with local folding) up to 15\u201320\u25e6 away from the\naxial part of the mountains producing in places >2 km of\nwww.clim-past.net\/6\/707\/2010\/ Clim.

These\nlavas therefore provide a well constrained upper age limit for\nthe surface uplift in the Coast Range Mountains of British\nColumbia. Similarly, in the Washington Cascades to the\nsouth (Fig. 2), Middle Miocene (\u223c15 Ma) lavas are tilted and\nuplifted in the eastern Cascades and reach elevations near\nMount Rainer that are 1.5 km higher than similar units ex-\nposed further to the east (Swanson, 1997). In addition, in nu-\nmerous locations, sedimentary rocks of Miocene age demon-\nstrate that regional warping and uplift occurred post 15 Ma\n(e.g. Reidel et al., 1994).\nFinally, low temperature thermochronometric studies have\nbeen conducted at numerous places in the western Cordillera\nfrom 47\u25e6 N to 63\u25e6 N (as summarised in Reiners et al., 2002\nand references therein; Fig. 2). These studies constitute a\nregional scale database that indicates a significant accelera-\ntion of rock exhumation rates during the Late Miocene (Rein-\ners et al., 2002; Parrish, 1983; O\u2019Sullivan and Parrish, 1995;\nFitzgerald et al., 1995; O\u2019Sullivan and Currie, 1996; Farley\net al., 2001). On its own such information should be inter-\npreted in terms of surface uplift with caution. However, nu-\nmerous studies have demonstrated that the amount of rock\nuplift and erosion in mountainous terranes are closely cou-\npled with local relief (e.g. Montgomery and Brandon, 2002).\nThis, in combination with the evidence discussed above, sug-\ngests that the acceleration in rock uplift rate during the Late\nMiocene of the coastal mountains north of\u223c47\u25e6 N is, at least\nin part, consistent with an increase in relief and topography\nat this time.\nIn this contribution, we revisit the hypothesis of Ruddi-\nman et al. (1989) concerning the uplift of the North Amer-\nican Cordillera. These authors proposed that uplift of the\nNorth American Cordillera during the Late Miocene\/Early\nPliocene was responsible for cooling North America and trig-\ngering the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation.\nIn contrast, Seki et al. (2010) document that INHG was trig-\ngered by orbital forcing once pCO2 had crossed the required\nthreshold value of \u223c280\u2013300 ppm (Deconto et al. 2008).\nConsequently, it is unlikely that mountain uplift played a di-\nrect role in triggering sustained glaciation in the Northern\nHemisphere in the Pliocene. Instead, we ask in this contri-\nbution whether mountain uplift was a vital precondition to\nthe INHG. In other words, in the absence of the mountains\nof the North American Cordillera would Northern Hemi-\nsphere glaciation have intensified at \u223c3 Ma as pCO2 de-\nclined to 280-300 ppm? We first present a new reconstruc-\ntion of Miocene topography of this region and then present\nnew modelling results of a sensitivity test using an ocean-\natmosphere GCM (HadCM3) and offline ice sheet model\n(GLIMMER). These results highlight that the climate of the\nNorthern Hemisphere is particularly sensitive to the topog-\nraphy of western North America that presents itself to west-\nerly atmospheric circulation. We show that even a relatively\nsmall change in elevation of the North American Cordillera\nis sufficient to cool the Northern Hemisphere and influence\nice sheet coverage during cold orbital stages. If large parts\nof the North American Cordillera did uplift during the Late\nMiocene\/Early Pliocene then they may have played a vital\nrole in favouring INHG\n2 Methodology\n2.1 Simplified topographic reconstruction\nReconstructing the topographic evolution of a mountainous\nregion is a rather difficult task and reconstructions such as\nthose discussed in section 1.2 are typically contentious. Nev-\nertheless, in the absence of better reconstructions we feel\nit is reasonable to suggest that some surface uplift of the\nNorth American Cordillera as a whole may have occurred\nsince the Miocene (as suggested by Ruddiman et al., 1989).\nWe feel however that there is considerably stronger evi-\ndence (reviewed in Sect. 1.2) to suggest that the westernmost\nCordillera, north of about 45\u25e6 N, has undergone significant\nsurface uplift since the Late Miocene. In order to model\nthe influence of this uplift on climate, we have approximated\nthe Early-Middle Miocene topography of the North Ameri-\ncan Cordillera (Fig. 3). To make this reconstruction we uni-\nformly truncated the North American topography north of\n45\u25e6 N at 750 m, retaining modern surface roughness. Due to\nthe spatial resolution of the model, this is roughly equivalent\nto reducing the average height of these ranges by \u223c500 m.\nAlthough this is in keeping with the geological evidence for\npre-Pliocene surface uplift, we acknowledge such topogra-\nphy may never have existed in this simplified form. Figure 3c\nshows the topographic differences between the modern day\ntopography (at model resolution) and our approximation of\nthe Early-Middle Miocene North American Cordillera.\n2.2 GCM simulations and ice sheet models\nAll the GCM simulations described in this paper are car-\nried out using the UK Met Office ocean-atmosphere GCM\n(HadCM3, version 4.5, Gordon et al., 2000). The resolu-\ntion of the atmospheric and land components is 3.75\u25e6 in lon-\ngitude by 2.5\u25e6 in latitude, with 19 vertical levels in the at-\nmosphere. The resolution of the ocean model is 1.25\u25e6 by\n1.25\u25e6 with 20 levels in the vertical. Parameterisations include\nthe radiation scheme of Edwards & Slingo (1996), the con-\nvection scheme of Gregory et al. (1997), and the MOSES-1\nland-surface scheme, whose representation of evaporation in-\ncludes the dependence of stomatal resistance on temperature,\nvapour pressure and CO2 concentration (Cox et al., 1999).\nThe ocean model uses the Gent and McWilliams (1990) mix-\ning scheme. There is no explicit horizontal tracer diffusion\nin the model. The horizontal resolution allows the use of a\nsmaller coefficient of horizontal momentum viscosity lead-\ning to an improved simulation of ocean velocities compared\nto earlier versions of the model. The sea ice model uses a\nClim. Past, 6, 707\u2013717, 2010 www.clim-past.net\/6\/707\/2010\/\nG. L. Foster et al.: Mountain uplift and the glaciation of North America 711\nTable 1.

In simulations of the present-day climate, the\nmodel has been shown to simulate SST in good agreement\nwith modern observations without the need for flux correc-\ntions (Gregory & Mitchell, 1997). This model has previously\nbeen used in several Cenozoic modelling studies (Lunt et al.,\n2008a, b; Lunt et al., 2009); Table 1 summarises the bound-\nary conditions used here and highlights the differences be-\ntween this and these published studies.\nWe carried out two coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM sim-\nulations using HadCM3 version 4.5. We initially carried out\na pre-industrial control simulation with modern orography\n(smoothed to the model resolution of 3.75\u25e6 longitude by 2.5\u25e6\nlatitude). A further simulation, termed \u201clow-45 N\u201d, with a\nreduced topography (shown in Fig. 3b) was then carried out.\nIn all other regards this perturbed simulation had identical\nboundary conditions (prescribed pCO2, ice sheet and vegeta-\ntion) to the pre-industrial control simulation. Compared to a\nfaster model of intermediate complexity, such as CLIMBER\n(Bonelli et al., 2009), this model allows a more accurate\nrepresentation of global topography. However, the limited\nmodel spin up time of \u201clow-45N\u201d (50 years i.e.< ocean over-\nturning) means only changes in atmospheric circulation and\nthe ocean mixed layer can be examined, in a similar way to\nif we had used a slab ocean model.\nAlthough the climate model used allows a more accurate\nsimulation of climate than intermediate complexity models,\nit is computationally intensive and this precludes the full\ncoupling of an ice sheet model to the GCM. We have used\nan offline ice sheet model, following Lunt et al. (2008a),\nto examine the effect of mountain uplift on Laurentide and\nCordilleran Ice Sheet inception only. However, because these\noffline ice sheet simulations do not include crucial feedbacks\n(e.g. albedo feedback), it is important to note that the ice\nsheets simulated represent minimum configurations. There-\nfore, although the simulated ice sheets are much smaller than\nthose in fully coupled models, they can still provide infor-\nmation regarding glacial inception (e.g. Lunt et al., 2008a).\nThese limitations, in addition to the fact that we did not use\na palaeogeography explicitly appropriate for the Miocene,\nmean this study should be viewed strictly as a sensitivity\nstudy examining the effects of mountain uplift in isolation.\nThe changes we observe and apply significance to are those\nof a first order nature and, although this study does have im-\nplications for Miocene climate, it should be noted that we\nare not trying to explicitly replicate the climate of the Late\nMiocene.\nThe 3-D thermomechanical ice sheet model used in this\nwork is GLIMMER version 1.0.4. The core of the model is\nbased on the ice sheet model described by Payne (1999; see\nRutt et al., 2009 for a full description of the model). The ice\ndynamics are represented with the widely-used shallow-ice\napproximation, and a full three-dimensional thermodynamic\nmodel is used to determine the ice flow law parameter (see\nSect. 3 of Rutt et al., 2009). The model is formulated on\na 20 km Cartesian x\u2212y grid and takes as input the surface\nmass-balance and air temperature at each time step. In the\npresent work, the ice dynamics time step is one year. To\nsimulate the surface mass-balance, we use the positive de-\ngree day (PDD) approach described by Reeh (1991). The use\nof PDD mass-balance models is well-established in coupled\natmosphere-ice sheet palaeoclimate modelling studies (e.g.\nDeConto and Pollard, 2003, Lunt et al., 2008a, b; Lunt et al.,\n2009). GLIMMER includes a representation of the isostatic\nresponse of the lithosphere, which is assumed to behave\nelastically, based on the model of Lambeck and Nakiboglu\n(1980). The forcing data from HadCM3 are transformed onto\nthe ice model grid using bilinear interpolation, which ensures\nthat precipitation is conserved in the atmosphere-ice-sheet\ncoupling. In the case of the surface air temperature field,\na vertical lapse-rate correction is used to take account of\nthe difference between the high-resolution topography seen\nwithin GLIMMER, and that represented with HadCM3. The\nuse of a lapse-rate correction to better represent the local\ntemperature is established in previous work (e.g. Pollard and\nThompson, 1997). We use anomaly coupling to force the ice\nwww.clim-past.net\/6\/707\/2010\/ Clim. Past, 6, 707\u2013717, 2010\n712 G. L.

The anomaly method\nis used to partly alleviate the cold bias in the model at high\nlatitudes (Randall et al. 2007); although over North Amer-\nica the bias is relatively low (less than 2 \u25e6C). For the baseline\nclimate to which the anomalies are applied, we use a stan-\ndard temperature and precipitation climatology derived from\nERA-40 reanalysis. The GLIMMER ice sheet model uses\na single value for the lapse-rate correction which we set to a\nvalue of 7.0 K km\u22121. For the standard pre-industrial ice sheet\nsimulations, we use the bedrock topography derived from the\nstandard ETOPO5 dataset. For the \u201clow-45 N\u201d simulation,\nwe truncated mountains along the west coast to 750 m north-\nwards of \u223c45\u25e6 N, in a similar way as in the corresponding\nGCM simulation.\nBecause the timescale for equilibrium of the North Ameri-\ncan ice sheets is comparable with orbital timescales, it is im-\nportant to carry out transient ice sheet simulations which in-\nclude orbital effects. We use a time variable orbital anomaly\nrepresenting the insolation experienced during a transition\nfrom near-average orbital conditions to glacial orbital con-\nditions and back again, over half a precessional cycle, that\nis, 10 000 years. In order to do this, we carry out an addi-\ntional GCM simulation under \u201ccold-orbit\u201d forcing; that is or-\nbital conditions for 115 kyr BP, but otherwise pre-industrial\nboundary conditions. This gives us an anomaly relative to\npre-industrial which represents the maximum orbital forcing\nover the 10 000 years. Then, for the final ice sheet simula-\ntions, we use the original GCM climate (\u201cpre-industrial con-\ntrol\u201d and \u201clow-45N\u201d), superimposed with the time-varying\norbital component. More details of this approach can be\nfound in Lunt et al. (2008a).\n3 Results\nFigure 4 shows the magnitude of surface air temperature (at\n2 m), precipitation, snow accumulation, and surface albedo\nwarm and cold season anomalies for the reduced topogra-\nphy simulation. In all cases, the anomalies are for the \u201cpre-\nindustrial control\u201d minus the \u201clow-45 N\u201d simulation, there-\nfore reflecting changes associated with uplift and the es-\ntablishment of the modern orography. From these figures,\nthe local and more distant hemispheric effects of uplift are\nclearly observable. For instance, the uplifted area is colder\n(Fig. 4a, b), and to the west of the uplifted area, precipitation\nand temperature have clearly increased (Fig. 4c, d) reflecting\nthe intensification of orographic precipitation. There are also\nseveral far-field effects that warrant further discussion. The\nmost significant observation is the strong winter but rather\nweak summer cooling of the NE American continent and the\nCanadian Arctic (Fig. 4a, b); this results in a minor increase\nin sea-ice extent off Greenland, and an associated increase in\nalbedo (Fig. 4e, f). These far-field temperature lows are co-\nincident with the 500 mb height anomaly (not shown) imply-\ning that the mountain uplift led to a deepening of the Rossby\nwave trough over this region. The consequent modification\nof storm tracks is also visible on the precipitation anomaly\n(Fig. 4c, d), which shows a predominantly winter reduction\nin the penetration of storms and associated precipitation in\nthe continental interior and reduced precipitation over parts\nof Greenland and NE Canada.\nFigure 5 shows the results of the ice sheet model described\nabove, in conjunction with an additional cold-orbit GCM\nsimulation, for the control (Fig. 5a) and \u201clow-45 N\u201d simula-\ntion (Fig. 5b).

It is important to note\nthat, since the ice sheet model is not fully coupled to the\nGCM, the positive feedbacks relating to ice growth are not\nrepresented so the ice sheets shown are minima (see Lunt\net al., 2008a for further discussion). It is, however, clear\nthat, due to temperature changes associated with uplift, in the\n\u201clow-45 N\u201d simulation with reduced topography (Fig. 4a, b),\nno Cordilleran Ice Sheet forms and there is a minor reduction\nof ice on Baffin Island.\n4 Discussion and conclusions\nThe most significant results of this study are the strong\nyear round cooling in the region uplifted (Fig. 4). In\nterms of ice sheet response, with reduced mountains, the\nCordilleran Ice Sheet fails to incept entirely and the amount\nof ice on Baffin Island is slightly reduced (Fig. 5). For\nthe Cordilleran ice sheet, this change is largely caused by\nthe direct effect of elevation change, i.e. given a lapse\nrate of 7.0 K km\u22121 a \u223c500 m reduction in height would\ncause a \u223c3.5 \u25e6C warming (Fig. 4). For Baffin Island there\nare no significant climatological anomalies associated with\nthis reduction in the ice sheet, suggesting this may be an\nwww.clim-past.net\/6\/707\/2010\/ Clim. Past, 6, 707\u2013717, 2010\n714 G. L. Foster et al.: Mountain uplift and the glaciation of North America\nartefact related to interannual variability in the driving cli-\nmate (Fig. 4). Nonetheless, the modelled response of the\nCordilleran Ice sheet to uplift is large, and this may have\nhad a significant impact on the growth of ice in the Northern\nHemisphere as a whole through ice sheet-climate feedbacks\n(e.g. the albedo feedback and through atmospheric and ocean\ncirculation). Lunt et al. (2008a) examined the influence of\nCordilleran uplift on ice sheet growth on Greenland during\nthe Mid Pliocene using an offline ice sheet model similar\nto that used here. They used a pCO2 value of 400 ppmv,\nand a more extreme uplift scenario (see Table 1), and con-\ncluded that uplift was not sufficient, on its own, to signifi-\ncantly enhance Greenland glaciation when compared to the\neffect of lowering pCO2 to 280 ppmv. Nevertheless, Lunt et\nal. (2008a) did model a small increase in the ice present on\nGreenland as a result of the cooling and precipitation changes\nsimilar to those shown in Fig. 4. The initial ice-sheet pre-\nscribed in the GCM simulations used in that study was larger\nthan the one grown following uplift. Therefore, in that case\nthe results are a maximum response and imply only a small\ngrowth of the Greenland ice sheet following uplift.\nThere are also several important regional and far-field cli-\nmatic shifts evident in our GCM results that are consistent\nwith existing studies of the Miocene climate. This, there-\nfore, provides additional support for there being a period\nof Cordilleran mountain uplift in the Late Miocene. For\ninstance, perhaps the most regionally significant far-field\nanomalies are the changes in precipitation patterns and the\ndevelopment of a rainy season (decrease in summer) in the\ncontinental interior of the US (Fig. 4d). There are a num-\nber of studies that document such a climatic shift occurring\nduring the Late Miocene, for instance Retallack (1997) notes\na marked drying in fossil paleosols and an expansion of the\nAmerican Prairie in the Late Miocene. Similarly, Fox (2000),\nusing mammalian fossils, documents a drying of the North\nAmerican continent associated with an increase in season-\nality in the Late Miocene, including the development of a\nwet season. Kohn and Fremd (2008) also record a decrease\nin faunal diversity in the Western US between 12 and 7 Ma\nthought to coincide with increased aridity and seasonality.\nA puzzling aspect of Late Cenozoic climate is that despite\ngenerally low CO2 during the last 25 million years (Fig. 1),\nthe prolonged glaciation of the North America and the North-\nern Hemisphere in general did not occur until \u223c3 million\nyears ago (Ruddiman, 2010). Our simulations imply that a\nreduction in the height of the North American Cordillera in-\nfluences North American climate and likely limits the glacia-\ntion of North America. Since we do not have a fully cou-\npled GCM-ice sheet model, we cannot determine exactly\nhow these changes in topography influence the level of CO2\nrequired to allow orbital forcing to kick-start INHG. Simi-\nlarly, our choice of initial climate state and model spin up\ntime precludes a more complete discussion of Miocene cli-\nmate change. Nonetheless, given the direction of the climate\ntrends described here, we can say with confidence that the\nthreshold CO2 value required is lower when the height of the\nNorth American Cordillera is reduced. It has been suggested\nthat the intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation\noccurred in several stages over a relatively protracted pe-\nriod (Maslin et al., 1998, Mudlesee and Raymo, 2005), these\nwere: (i) early glaciation of Greenland from 3 to 3.8 Ma;\n(ii) glaciation of Eurasian Arctic and the North American\nCordillera from 2.70 to 2.74 Ma; and (iii) glaciation of Eura-\nsia and North America at \u223c2.55 Ma (e.g. Balco and Rovey,\n2010). In the absence of a Cordilleran Ice Sheet, and its as-\nsociated albedo related cooling, this sequence may be pre-\nvented from running to completion. Consequently, a lower\nNorth American Cordillera may have played a crucial role\nin preventing glaciation of North America during the Middle\nand Early Miocene, despite relatively low CO2 levels during\nthese time periods (Fig. 1). Also, it is important to note that\nuplift of the North American Cordillera did not occur in iso-\nlation; rather it seems a number of areas suffered regional\nuplift in the Late Miocene (e.g. Tibet, Andes, SW Africa).\nOther published studies suggest that uplift in these areas was\nalso associated with regional and far-field climatic change\n(e.g. Sepulchre et al., 2006; Lunt et al., in press). However,\nuntil better palaeotopographic reconstructions are available,\nthe exact role of mountain uplift in influencing Late Ceno-\nzoic climate evolution will continue to be uncertain and rel-\natively unconstrained in magnitude when compared to other\nenvironmental factors. Reconstructions of past palaeotopog-\nraphy are thus an important uncertainty in modelling climate\ndynamics in the past and this should be addressed.\nAcknowledgements.
