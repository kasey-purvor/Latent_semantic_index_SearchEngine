The relative impact of pathways associated with infection and under-\nnutrition may, however, differ across socio-economic groups: in poorer children, the impact of mucosal damage and immunostimulation could\nbe masked by nutritional constraints. This has important implications for public health interventions.\nInfant growth: Intestinal permeability: Malnutrition: Immune response: Nepal: The Gambia: Public health policy\nDespite decades of nutritional and health interventions, child-\nhood growth faltering remains a feature of the life course in\nmost developing countries(1): worldwide, 25% of children\nunder 5 years are under-weight, 31% are stunted and 11%\nare wasted(2). It is during the first 2 years of life, when\ngrowth is rapid, that children seem particularly vulnerable to\nenvironmental constraints; the World Bank(3) recently ident-\nified this period as \u2018the window of opportunity for addressing\nundernutrition\u2019. Fig. 1 specifies the two key mechanisms that\ncause growth faltering. Much attention has been paid to under-\nnutrition (pathway A), yet nutritional intervention programmes\nhave invariably produced disappointing results, failing to raise\ngrowth performance to expected levels(4,5). It is increasingly\nrecognised that although an adequate supply of nutrients is\nclearly required, this is not sufficient to ensure normal child-\nhood growth. Frequent and persistent infections (pathway B)\nresulting, for example, from increased pathogen exposure\ndue to poor hygiene, also restrict growth(6\u20138). Undernutrition\nand infection are closely inter-related and their synergistic\neffect on childhood growth has been extensively documented\n(see Calder & Jackson(9) for review).\nOne mechanism by which disease leads to energy deficit\nand growth faltering has recently been demonstrated in The\nGambia. In these studies on young children (,18 months),\nover 40% of growth faltering was explained by the presence\nof small intestinal mucosal enteropathy associated with\nchronic stimulation of both local and systemic immune and\ninflammatory systems(10,11). Lunn(11) argued that pathogenic\ndamage to the small intestine mucosa leads to (1) the loss of\ndigestive enzymes resulting in maldigestion and malabsorp-\ntion of nutrients and (2) a compromised barrier function that\nallows macromolecules and perhaps intact organisms to trans-\nlocate into the body, leading to both local and systemic\nimmune and inflammatory responses (Fig. 1, pathway B).\n*Corresponding author: Professor C.

The present\nstudy aimed to evaluate such relationships in Nepal, where\ngrowth faltering during childhood is also very common:\nalmost 50% of children under 5 years of age are moderately\nor severely stunted or underweight(2). As in The Gambia,\ngrowth retardation coexists with extremely poor household\nhygiene and sanitation(12), but differs in that there is no malaria\nat this altitude and breastfeeding continues for several years(13),\nfactors which potentially alter the associations between growth,\ngut damage and immune responses(14). Because there are\nmarked differences in growth status across rural, urban poor,\nand urban middle-class communities in Nepal(12,14\u201317), the pre-\nsent study also aimed to evaluate the relative impact of gut\ndamage and immunostimulation on growth in contrasting\nenvironments and socio-economic contexts.\nParticipants and methods\nField sites\nThe fieldwork (in 2005) coincided with a worsening of\nNepal\u2019s on-going political instability, making it impossible to\ninclude a rural cohort as originally planned. The study focused\non two urban cohorts, contrasting in socio-economic status, in\nKathmandu, the capital of Nepal. The first was recruited from\nthe four largest squatter settlements in Kathmandu (Ramhiti,\nPathibhara, two sites inBalaju). The second cohortwas recruited\nfrom lower middle-class households in a periurban area of\nthe city (Kirtipur) where the community had previously\nparticipated in maternal\u2013child health research(18).\nAge range and sampling\nTo identify the critical period of growth faltering, a baseline\ncross-sectional anthropometric assessment was conducted on\n0\u201324-month-olds (n 158). This included a total sample of\nchildren in this age range living in the four squatter sites\n(n 79) and a random sample of age-matched middle-class\nchildren (n 79) selected from municipal household lists. This\nbaseline assessment identified the main period of growth\nfaltering as occurring between 6 and 18 months (data not\nshown).\nThe follow-up study therefore focused on 3\u201318-month-old\nchildren. This allowed younger infants (3\u20136 months) to\nenter the target age range (6\u201318 months) over the course of\nstudy. All squatter children aged 3\u201318 months (n 50) in the\nfour study areas and a random sub-sample of age-matched\nmiddle-class children (n 40) were recruited for the longitudi-\nnal work, hereby achieving a representative sample of the\nsquatter and middle-class population.\nMeasures of growth, intestinal permeability, morbidity and\nblood markers of immunostimulation were taken monthly,\nover a period of 7 months. Full datasets were obtained for\nforty-eight squatter and thirty-eight middle-class children\n(n 86), after attrition of just four children (two moved out of\nthe area and two withdrew from the study).\nFig. 1. A model of two pathways leading to childhood growth faltering.\nMucosal damage and growth faltering 559\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nAnthropometry\nWeight and length were measured following standard tech-\nniques(19) using portable equipment (SECA stadiometer\n(0\u00b75 cm precision) and SECA electronic scales (0\u00b701 kg pre-\ncision); Milton Keynes Scales, Leighton Buzzard, UK).\nAll measurements were taken by the same investigator.\n(Duplicate measures for twenty children were taken to calcu-\nlate technical errors of measurement(20), which yielded very\ngood coefficients of reliability, R . 0\u00b798.)\nMucosal enteropathy\nMucosal enteropathy was assessed using the lactose:creatinine\ntest, a method similar to the lactulose:mannitol intestinal per-\nmeability test commonly used in previous studies(10,14), but\nallows for the collection of a single, untimed urine sample.\nIn measuring lactose rather than lactulose, this technique\nrelies on the assumption that in children who are regularly\nbreast-fed, the flux of lactose through the body achieves a\nsteady state(21). If the mucosa of the small intestine is normal,\nmost of the lactose will be hydrolysed by intestinal lactase and\nthe resulting monosaccharide sugars absorbed into the body;\nonly a small amount of lactose remains intact, to be excreted\nin urine. In this respect, lactose behaves like its isomer lactu-\nlose, facilitating tests of mucosal integrity in a single urine\nsample rather than the standard 5 h sample required for tests\nof intestinal permeability.\nIf the mucosal surface has been reduced (e.g. by enteropa-\nthy), less lactase enzyme will be available to digest lactose.\nAs a result, less lactose will be hydrolysed in proportion to\nthe deficiency of lactase and degree of mucosal atrophy;\nmore lactose will be recovered in the urine. If the mucosal\nbarrier function is also compromised, even more lactose will\ntranslocate into the body through gaps in the intestinal\nwalls, with urine levels rising even further. Thus increased\nexcretion of lactose in the urine indicates either mucosal atro-\nphy or increased leakiness of the mucosal barrier function, or a\nmixture of both, in the same way as the intestinal permeability\nratio obtained in a 5 h sample(21). Creatinine is also produced\nand excreted into the urine at a constant rate; in the absence of\ndietary creatine or creatinine, the amount excreted is depen-\ndent on body musculature(22). Thus, in a single sample of\nurine, the ratio of lactose to creatinine (corrected for body\nmusculature) will give a value dependent on mucosal status.\nThis ratio is closely related to the lactulose:mannitol intestinal\npermeability ratio as a measure of mucosal status(23).\nEach month, a single untimed urine sample was collected\nfrom the children, using a sterile urine collection pad\n(Uricol; Ontex Healthcare, Corby, UK), which was secured\ninside a locally purchased nappy. Mothers were encouraged to\nbreastfeed or give water to their children to encourage urination.\nThe urine pad was checked every 10min; once wet (usually\nwithin 1 h), urine was extracted using a disposable syringe.\nSamples (2ml) were preserved with bacteriostat (chlorhexidine\ndigluconate, one drop of a 2 g\/l solution) and frozen at 2208C\nuntil shipment to the UK. Urinary lactose was analysed\nby an enzymatic assay(24), and creatinine by a Jaffe technique\n(Randox Creatinine Assay Kit; Randox, Crumlin, Co.\nAntrim, UK).\nBlood proteins\nFinger-prick samples were obtained using Hemocue lancets\n(Hemocue Ltd, Dronfield, UK). One drop was used to obtain\nan on-the-spot Hb value, using a haemoglobinometer (Hemocue\nLtd). Up to four drops were collected on to Guthrie cards\n(Whatman Schleicher & Schuell, Maidstone, UK), dried and\nthen frozen with desiccant (at2208C) until shipment to the UK.\nDiscs (6mm) were punched out from the blood-spots on the\nGuthrie cards and plasma constituents eluted by 24 h incu-\nbation in 1\u00b725ml phosphosaline buffer (0\u00b701M-sodium phos-\nphate, 0\u00b75 M-sodium chloride, pH 7\u00b72) containing 1% Tween\n20(16). The eluate (approximately a 1:100 dilution of the\nwhole blood sample) was analysed for Hb, albumin, a-1-\nacid glycoprotein (AGP) and IgG. Hb was determined by a\ncyanmethaemoglobin technique (Randox Haemoglobin Assay\nKit; Randox) and albumin by a turbidimetric method using\nreagents from DakoCytomation (Ely, UK). AGP and IgG\nwere assayed by double sandwich ELISA techniques using\nantibodies from Insight Biotechnology (London, UK) and\nDakoCytomation, respectively.\nRatios between original Hb values (measured by the Hemo-\ncue) and Hb concentrations in the dried blood spots were used\nto correct concentrations of albumin, AGP and IgG for poss-\nible elution error. The correction factor was 1\u00b798, based\nupon recovery from the blood spots of 87\u00b76 (SD 0\u00b78) % and\nthe conversion factor of 2\u00b726 obtained from our previous\nblood-spot data collection in Nepal(16). It is important to\nappreciate that the plasma values reported here are only esti-\nmates and are quoted to allow comparison with measured\nplasma values in the literature. Following WHO recommended\nminimum values for children(25), anaemia was defined as less\nthan 110 g\/l.\nHousehold characteristics, childcare practices and morbidity\nsurveys\nSocio-economic and demographic data were collected from all\nparticipants using questions adapted from previous govern-\nment surveys conducted in Nepal. A composite score of\nsocio-economic status was created using data on parental\nlevels of literacy and education, home ownership, housing\ntype, access to water and sanitation facilities and ownership\nof certain valuable possessions such as radio or television.\nMothers provided morbidity reports for their child, describ-\ning all symptoms of ill-health during the 7 d prior to the field-\nwork visit. Children\u2019s faecal samples were collected each\nmonth to assess parasitic infection load; however, following\nlogistical difficulties and unavailability of competent labora-\ntory technicians in Kathmandu, faecal data had to be dis-\ncarded. Information on feeding practices was collected at the\nstart of the study. Measures of dietary intakes were beyond\nthe scope of this project, given the logistical challenges of bio-\nlogical sample collection in squatter settlements.\nEthical approval\nEthical approval was obtained from both the Nepal Health\nResearch Council (Kathmandu) and Durham University\nEthics and Data Protection Committee. All procedures were\ndemonstrated to the mothers at the start of the study and\nC. Panter-Brick et al.560\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\ninformed consent obtained. A small gift of 120Rs (\u00a31) was\ngiven at each measurement session. At the end of the study,\nmothers were offered clothing for their child and, where\nappropriate, children were provided with medical treatment.\nStatistical analyses\nGrowth status was assessed from Z-scores for height-for-age\n(HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ) and weight-for-height (WHZ),\nat each study point, using US National Center for Health\nStatistics 2000 reference data calculated with Epi Info.\nGrowth performance was evaluated from changes in height-\nand weight-for-age Z-scores (DHAZ, DWAZ, DWHZ) over\nthe period of the study. Between-subject relationships were\nassessed by regression analyses using summary data (means\nof all monthly measurements) on each child. A mucosal\ndamage index (MDI) was calculated by averaging monthly\nlactose:creatine values determined for each child over the\nperiod of study, and normalised by log transformation.\nSocio-economic and demographic differences between the\ncohorts were assessed using x2, parametric and non-parametric\ntests, with two-tailed significance levels, using the Statistical\nPackage for Social Sciences version 15 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,\nUSA). For the purposes of analyses and charts, children were\ncategorised into age bands referring to their mean age over\nthe period of study: 6\u201311\u00b79 months, n 30; 12\u201317\u00b79 months,\nn 26; 18\u201323\u00b79 months, n 29.\nResults\nSocio-economic differences\nAs expected, the two groups differed greatly in socio-econ-\nomic status, both in terms of the composite score (P,0\u00b7001)\nand each constituent item. In squatter settlements, 74% of\nfamilies owned their own homes, but did not have deeds to\nthe land(26) (Table 1). Houses were insubstantial and crowded;\nroofs were made of corrugated iron sheets and 51% featured\nno separate cooking or sleeping area. Squatters had limited\naccess to water, using public taps, which operated only a\nfew hours a day, and\/or manually-operated rower pumps.\nMost families had a toilet in their own home, although 20%\nshared access to latrines with their neighbours or else used\npublic toilets. Cheaper sources of cooking fuel such as fire-\nwood and kerosene were the most commonly used (80% of\nfamilies). Most families (90%) did not own any item from a\nlist of seven valuable possessions.\nIn the middle-class area, housing and sanitation facilities\nwere considerably better. Houses were larger and more sub-\nstantially built: 87% had a kitchen separate from the general\nliving area and 59% had concrete or cement roofs. All families\nhad access to a private toilet and over half (56%) had access\nto piped water in their own homes, the rest relying on water\nfrom public taps nearby. Of families, 60 % could afford gas or\nelectricity as cooking fuel. Ownership of valuable possessions\nwas recorded for 97% of families, with a median of two items.\nParental educational and occupational levels were also very\ndifferent (Table 1): 43% of mothers and 14% of fathers in\nsquatter areas were illiterate, compared to 3% for both mothers\nand fathers in the middle-class area. Among those who had\nattended school, squatters completed only primary-level edu-\ncation, while middle-class parents reached at least secondary\nlevel. Most squatter fathers were employed in low-paid,\nunskilled jobs (labourers, builders or drivers), in contrast to\nthe skilled occupations (mechanics, shop-keepers, teachers\nand pharmacists) in middle-class areas (data not shown).\nFeeding practices\nAll children enrolled in the study were breastfed throughout\nthe period of investigation (following the custom of\non-demand breastfeeding up until 2 or 3 years of age(13)).\nTable 1.

Complementary foods\nwere introduced at a mean age of 5 (SD 2\u00b723) months in both\ncohorts and consisted of a cereal-based porridge or small\namounts of dal bhaat (the traditional Nepali staple of rice\nand lentils). Children of this age range receive only very\nsmall amounts of meat which would contribute to urinary\ncreatinine.\nMorbidity\nMorbidity reports were collected every month; questionnaires\nwere complete for all monthly interviews for 95 and 96% of\nsquatter and middle-class children, respectively. Reported\nmorbidity was higher for the poorer children (Fig. 2): sickness\nin the previous 7 d was reported for 38% of the study period\namong squatters relative to 25% of the time among the middle\nclass. Reports of diarrhoea and fever were more frequent\namong the former, coughs and colds among the latter.\nGrowth\nThe deterioration in anthropometric status during the first 2\nyears of life is clearly illustrated in Fig. 3 (a\u2013c). Two points\nare evident from these data. Firstly, both groups experienced\nmarked faltering in height and weight. Thus middle-class chil-\ndren showed a slow, progressive deterioration in growth status\nthroughout the age range; squatter children showed a marked\ndeterioration for HAZ and WAZ at 12\u201318 months relative\nto infancy, but stabilised beyond this age. WHZ also fell\nprogressively with age in both groups. Secondly, as expected,\nmiddle-class children were taller and heavier than their squat-\nter counterparts (HAZ, P,0\u00b7001 and WAZ, P\u00bc0\u00b7009 overall\nfor all children, at end-point of study). However, statistically\nsignificant differences between groups only emerged for\nHAZ after 12 months of age (12\u201318 months, P,0\u00b701;\n18\u201324 months, P,0\u00b7026).\nGrowth performance over the 7 months of study did not\ndiffer between cohorts: DHAZ 20\u00b7064 (SD 0\u00b7013) and 0\u00b7040\n(SD 0\u00b7014) for squatter and middle class, respectively;\nDWAZ, 20\u00b7082 (SD 0\u00b7015) and 20\u00b7070 (SD 0\u00b7017) for squat-\nter and middle class, respectively.\nFig. 2.

Overall, MDI was higher in\nsquatter than in middle-class children: for all ages, geometric\nmeans were 0\u00b714 (95% CI 0\u00b712, 0\u00b716) and 0\u00b708 (95% CI 0\u00b707,\n0\u00b710), respectively (data not tabulated; P,0\u00b7001). For both\ncohorts, there was a fall in MDI values, i.e. an improvement\nin mucosal status, with increasing age (Fig. 4 (a), P,0\u00b7001).\nDifferences between groups were statistically significant at\n6\u201312 months (P\u00bc0\u00b7007) and 18\u201324 months (P\u00bc0\u00b7002), but\nnot 12\u201318 months.\nPlasma albumin andAGP concentrations (Fig. 4 (b, c)) did not\ndiffer between groups and neither changed consistently with\nage. IgG concentrations (Fig. 4 (d)), however, were higher\nin the squatter children (all ages P,0\u00b7001; and in the three\nage bands P\u00bc0\u00b701, P\u00bc0\u00b7005, P\u00bc0\u00b703, respectively). IgG\nalso increased with age in both groups (P\u00bc0\u00b7002). Hb\nconcentrations (Fig. 4 (e)) were elevated in themiddle class rela-\ntive to squatters (P\u00bc0\u00b703), increasing with age in the latter\n(P\u00bc0\u00b7007) but not the former. Hb was also negatively related\nto MDI (overall, r 2 0\u00b718; P,0\u00b7001; in middle class, r 2 0\u00b713,\nP\u00bc0\u00b703; in squatter, r 2 0\u00b716, P\u00bc0\u00b7005; data not shown).\nAssociations with growth\nRegarding growth status, higher MDI values were strongly\nassociated with lower HAZ, WAZ and WHZ (Table 2).\nWhen cohorts were analysed separately, MDI associations\nwith WAZ and WHZ remained significant (stronger in\nmiddle class for WAZ, but stronger in squatters for WHZ).\nHowever for HAZ, associations were significant only in the\nmiddle-class group.\nRegarding growth performance, DHAZ and DWAZ were\nalso significantly related to MDI (Fig. 5 (a, b)); this was not\nthe case for DWHZ (Table 2). Despite the fact that squatter\nchildren exhibit higher MDI values, relationships with\nDWAZ (b-coefficients) were weaker than those observed in\nmiddle-class children; for DHAZ, relationships did not reach\nstatistical significance. In all cases, the higher the MDI, the\npoorer the growth performance.\nPlasma IgG concentrations were negatively related to WAZ\n(P\u00bc0\u00b7034), but no relationships were observed with other\nmeasures of growth status (HAZ, WHZ), or growth perform-\nance (DHAZ, DWAZ, DWHZ), over the period of the study.\nLikewise, no significant correlations between plasma AGP\nand any of the growth variables were detected. In all but\none round of study, AGP was elevated in children for whom\nmothers reported morbidity during the 7 d preceding blood\nsampling (data not shown). In contrast, IgG concentrations\nwere not associated with reported morbidity.\nTable 2.

We report significant associations\nbetween the severity of small intestinal mucosal damage\n(as measured by lactose:creatinine, corrected for body weight)\nand growth measures in breastfed children under 2 years\nof age. A higher MDI, indicative of greater mucosal disrup-\ntion, was associated in multiple regressions with both\npoorer growth status (P,0\u00b7001 for HAZ, WAZ and WHZ)\nand poorer growth performance during the period of the\nstudy (P\u00bc0\u00b7004 for DHAZ, P,0\u00b7001 for DWAZ; Table 2).\nConsidering both cohorts together, the MDI explained 9% of\nthe deficit in height and 19% of the deficit in weight gain.\nA secondary aim was to establish the relative importance of\nthese associations across different environmental and socio-\neconomic contexts. Unexpectedly, the relative impact of MDI\non growth performance was stronger in the middle-class\ncohort, despite the fact that, in absolute terms, the squatters\nexhibited poorer growth status and more severe mucosal\ndamage. Among middle-class children, MDI accounted for\n22% of faltering in height growth (DHAZ), whereas among\nsquatters it had no significant impact. Again, among middle-\nclass children, MDI accounted for 29% of deterioration in\nweight gain (DWAZ), relative to only 14% among squatters.\nRelationships between MDI and both DHAZ and DWAZ\n(b-coefficients) were notably stronger in the middle class; this\nwas also true for the cross-sectional measures of growth status\n(HAZ and WAZ), but not for DWHZ nor for WHZ (Table 2).\nIf we consider infection as a primary cause of growth\nfaltering (Fig. 1, pathway B), such results are unexpected.\nRelative to the middle class, squatter families lived in\nmuch poorer areas, with higher levels of overcrowding, poor\nhygiene and sanitation facilities, resulting in a more patho-\ngenic environment; moreover, they were worse off in terms\nof socio-economic status, material wealth, occupation and\nliteracy. As we have shown, squatter children exhibited\npoorer growth (HAZ, P,0\u00b7001; WAZ, P\u00bc0\u00b7009), higher\nlevels of mucosal damage (P,0\u00b7001) and higher plasma\nIgG concentrations (P,0\u00b7001), a useful indicator of long-\nterm exposure to infection, relative to middle-class children.\nThey also had elevated morbidity, in particular diarrhoea\nand fevers. Thus they showed greater exposure to pathogens,\npoorer mucosal integrity and increased immunostimulation;\nyet the associations between mucosal damage and growth\nwere less pronounced than those observed for the better-off,\nmiddle-class children. Why might this be the case?\nThe present data suggest that growth amongst squatter chil-\ndren is being constrained by several powerful factors. Given\nsignificant logistic challenges in Kathmandu, we focused the\nstudy on evaluating the impact of infection on growth (path-\nway B); we did not include a quantitative evaluation of dietary\nintakes (pathway A). Our experience of the field, which\nincludes participant observation over 7 months of study,\nsuggests that dietary intake (quality and\/or quantity) is likely\nto be a greater problem in squatter settlements than in\nmiddle-class areas. Evidence of greater nutritional constraints\nin the squatter areas is shown from data on maternal BMI:\n10% of mothers were underweight (BMI , 18\u00b75 kg\/m2) in\nsquatter areas, compared to just 3% in middle-class areas.\nIt is fair to say that squatter children faced greater con-\nstraints with respect to both pathway A (undernutrition) and\npathway B (infection), compared to middle-class children.\nIt may be that pathway A placed the greatest constraint on\ngrowth, and that this masked the relative impact of MDI for\nthe squatter children. In the middle-class group, where there\nmay be fewer dietary constraints, the impact of MDI was\nmore pronounced.\nWe suspect that if one were to implement a nutritional inter-\nvention in squatter areas, it would (like in many other\ntrials(4,5)) fail to improve growth performance in any lasting\nway; alleviating the one problem (undernutrition) would\nsimply unmask the impact of a second (mucosal damage\nand infection). This would have important implications for\npublic health policy: the implementation of nutritional inter-\nventions, without addressing basic issues of hygiene, sani-\ntation and pathogen exposure, is unlikely to have much\nimpact on the growth of the poorest children.\nThe results of the present study are based on a novel index\nof mucosal integrity, the lactose:creatinine ratio, developed\nspecifically for use with breastfed children. It has a number\nof advantages over the commonly used lactulose:mannitol\nintestinal permeability test to assess small bowel mucosal\nintegrity(11,27), which requires dosing infants with the lactulo-\nse:mannitol sugar solution and a 5 h urine collection period,\ngreatly limiting its acceptability to mothers and usage in the\nfield. By contrast, the lactose:creatinine test is extremely\nnon-invasive, proceeding without dosing and requiring only\na single \u2018spot\u2019 urine sample collected onto absorbent cotton\nwool. It is less accurate than the intestinal permeability test,\ngiven that baseline assumptions (a standard intake of breast-\nmilk for children across all ages, and an insignificant supply\nof dietary creatinine) may not always be met. However, depar-\ntures from these assumptions will affect the lactose:creatinine\nratio only to a small extent, relative to the very large changes\nin lactose uptake by the small intestine. For example, the geo-\nmetric mean for lactose:creatinine (adjusted for body weight)\nin this study was 0\u00b710 (2 SD 0\u00b702\u20130\u00b756; more than a 20-fold\nrange); by contrast a large (^25%) variation in milk ingestion\nwould lead to much smaller ratio changes (^25%). Variation\nin creatinine excretion due to periods of increased catabolism\nor muscle wasting would similarly affect the ratio by rela-\ntively small amounts(23). In cases of severe wasting, it may\nbe necessary to correct for body musculature more accurately\nthan by using body weight, but as children in the present study\nwere not wasted (Fig. 3 (c)), the use of body weight does not\nintroduce a large error. While dietary creatinine would raise\nurinary creatinine concentration, it is unlikely that these\nNepali children received enough meat or meat products to\naffect the validity of the results. A field study designed specifi-\ncally to validate the lactose:creatinine test suggests it is a\nuseful index of small bowel mucosal damage, given its close\ncorrelations with lactulose:mannitol intestinal permeability\nresults(21).\nTable 3 summarises the comparison between the present\ndata from Nepal and data from The Gambia (unpublished\nresults from Campbell et al. (10)), albeit for different urban\n(Nepal)\/rural (The Gambia) groups and small sub-samples\n(restricted to age-matched children). Relative to The\nGambia, the middle class in Nepal show better height- and\nweight-for-age (P,0\u00b7001 and P,0\u00b705, respectively), lower\nMucosal damage and growth faltering 565\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nplasma IgG concentrations (P,0\u00b701) and less severe mucosal\ndamage (P,0\u00b7001). The Nepali squatter children are similar\nto the Gambians in terms of height, weight and IgG levels;\nhowever, their MDI is lower (P,0\u00b705), indicating less muco-\nsal damage, with a weaker relationship with growth. In Nepal\n(Table 2), MDI values accounted for 9 and 19% of growth\ndeficits in height and weight, respectively (for squatters, 1%\nof DHAZ and 14% of DWAZ; for middle class, 22 and\n29%, respectively). This compares to 43 and 40% of height\nand weight deficits reported in The Gambia(11).\nThe data indicate differences in the relative importance of\npathways A and B underlying growth faltering in young chil-\ndren. For Gambian infants, it may be that infection, not diet, is\nthe greatest stressor for growth, perhaps as a consequence of\ntheir early introduction of complementary foods. In Nepal,\nwhile infection is clearly a problem, it may be that undernutri-\ntion is the greater constraint on growth faltering, at least\namong squatters. The present study highlights the need for\nfurther research into the relative impact of infection and nutri-\ntion across social ecologies, at different key ages of life his-\ntory and child development.\nAcknowledgements\nThere are no conflicts of interest, either financial or contrac-\ntual.
