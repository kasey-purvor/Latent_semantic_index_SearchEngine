A critical \nexamination of two linked research literatures in relation to obesity and food choice \n \nRenewed interest in television advertising, children\u2019s food choice, and obesity \nThere has been longstanding public concern over the potentially harmful effects \nof food promotion on children. While previous food-related concerns focused on \nnutrition, dental health, dieting and anorexia, high levels of concern across the developed \nworld currently centre on the evidence of rising obesity among children (World Health \nOrganization, 2000). In the UK, the Royal College of Physicians reported that obesity has \ndoubled among 2-4 year olds between 1989 and 1998, and trebled among 6-15 year olds \nbetween 1990 and 2002 (Royal College of Physicians, 2004). Research by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention in the USA also showed that since 1980 the rate of \nobesity for young people has doubled and, in the case of teenagers, trebled: 30% of \nchildren between the ages of 6 and 19 are now estimated to be at risk of being overweight \n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004; Kaiser Foundation, 2004; Story & \nFrench, 2004). \nThe food industry is a major player in the field of advertising. Total UK \nadvertising spending per annum in the categories of food, soft drinks and chain \nrestaurants is \u00a3743 million, with \u00a3522 million spent on television advertising and \u00a332 \nmillion spent in children\u2019s airtime (Ofcom, 2004). In the USA, a total of $12 billion per \nyear is spent to reach the young audience (Kunkel, et al., 2004). Food advertising on \ntelevision is dominated by breakfast cereals, confectionary, savory snacks and soft drinks, \nwith fast-food restaurants taking up an increasing proportion of television advertising for \nfoods high in fat, sugar and salt on television (Ambler, 2004; Hastings  et al., 2003; \nYoung, 2003).  \nHastings et al. (2003) recently conducted a major review of research on food \npromotion to children  for the UK\u2019s Food Standards Agency, in response to renewed \npublic policy attention to the role of television advertising in children\u2019s food choice \n(generally defined in terms of their food knowledge, preferences and behavior). A \nparallel review of the effects of television advertising on children was undertaken in \nAmerica (Kunkel et al., 2004). Both reviews raise a familiar set of issues regarding \ntheory, methods, and findings, for the question of advertising\u2019s role in children\u2019s food \nchoice is heavily contested (Livingstone, 2005; Martin, 1997; Paliwoda & Crawford, \n2003; Story & French, 2004). Both reviews also expressed concern, however, that the \nmajority of studies on this topic were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Indeed, \nsubsequent publications tend to reprise, with few changes, the same set of empirical \nstudies. Before either drawing research conclusions or formulating policy responses, it \ntherefore seems appropriate to ask how far this research can be relied upon in today\u2019s \ncircumstances (Valkenburg, 2000). \nMany aspects of the advertising process are widely held to have changed in recent \ndecades. Children and teens represent a fast-growing market segment, and the effort and \nexpenditure devoted to targeting them has expanded considerably (Martin, 1997; Moore, \n2004; Pecheux & Derbaix, 1999; Story & French, 2004) and has become more \nsophisticated in its techniques (Kunkel et al., 2004; Moore, 2004; McNeal, 1992). On the \nother hand, children are also supposedly more sophisticated or media literate by \ncomparison with earlier generations (Martin, 1997; Pecheux & Derbaix, 1999) though \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 3 \nValkenburg (2000) questions whether evidence supports this claim. Also important are \nthe changes in child-rearing practices and family dynamics, combining to give children a \ngreater role in consumer decisions (Valkenburg, 2000). The media environment more \ngenerally has diversified, with commercial messages becoming more pervasive through \nmultiple channels and cross-media promotions (Kunkel et al., 2004; McNeal, 1992; Story \n& French, 2004). \nBut the present article is not just a plea for scholars to update the empirical \nresearch base in the face of a pressing public policy agenda. Rather, our own re-visiting \nof the literature has led us to identify a surprising but crucial gap between research on \nadvertising literacy and research on advertising\u2019s effects (Livingstone & Helsper, 2004). \nIn what follows, we first characterize the problem, focusing substantively on the domain \nof children\u2019s food choice. We then develop a way forward, drawing on the cognitive \ntheory of persuasion. The overall argument has wider implications beyond the current \nproblem of obesity and children\u2019s food choice, leading us to suggest some future \ndirections for research on children and advertising in general. \n \nThe importance of age in research on literacy \n \nWe begin with the prevailing consensus regarding advertising literacy. Media \nliteracy has been defined as \u201cthe ability to access, analyze, evaluate and create messages \nacross a variety of contexts\u201d (Christ & Potter, 1998, p. 7; see also Hobbs & Frost, 2003). \nAdvertising literacy, by extension, is understood as the skills of analyzing, evaluating and \ncreating persuasive messages across a variety of contexts and media (Young, 2003). The \nrelationship between children\u2019s age and their developing media and advertising literacy is \nwell established. Drawing on Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development (John, 1999; \nValkenburg, 2000; Young, 2003), two factors are seen as crucial: being able to \ndistinguish advertisements from programs, and being able to recognize the persuasive \nintent underlying advertising. The latter represents a more complex skill that develops \nlater (Kunkel & Wilcox, 2001).  \nReviews of the research on children, both in relation to food advertising and also \nfor advertising in general, offer a consistent account of the development of advertising \nliteracy. Piaget\u2019s preoperational stage (ages 2-7), concrete operational stage (ages 7-12) \nand formal operational stage (age 12+) have, following many studies of children\u2019s \nunderstanding of the nature of television advertising, been used to inform a \ncharacterization of the three main stages of advertising literacy (Bandyopadhyay, Kindra, \n& Sharp, 2001; Hastings  et al., 2003; Kunkel, 1990; Kunkel  et al., 2004; Oates,  et al., \n2002; Valkenburg & Cantor, 2001; Young, 2003; Young, Webley, Hetherington, & \nZeedijk, 1996). \nSummarizing this literature, it seems that before about 5 years old, children do not \nconsistently distinguish advertising from programs and so regard advertising as \nentertainment or as information about products rather than as persuasion (Blosser & \nRoberts, 1985; Buijzen & Valkenburg, 2003a, 2003b; Wartella, 1980). However, by \nabout 7 or 8 years old, children have learned to identify the persuasive intent of \nadvertising, distinguishing it from information although, as Roedder (1981) added, they \noften do not use this knowledge spontaneously and must be cued to do so (see also \nBrucks, Armstrong & Goldberg, 1988; John, 1999; Moore, 2004). Lastly, from about 12 \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 4 \nyears old, children can articulate a critical understanding of advertising and of the \nintentions of its producers (Martin, 1997; Peterson & Lewis, 1988; Peterson, Jeffrey, \nBridgwater, & Dawson, 1984), even becoming skeptical or distrustful of advertising \n(Boush, 2001; Dorr, 1986; van Evra, 1998). \n \nThe neglect of age in research on effects \n \nBetween about 7 and 11 years old, children are in a transitional phase in their \nresponses to advertising, while younger children are widely considered limited in \ncognitive terms, and so vulnerable to advertising. And herein lies the incongruity when \nwe turn to the question of advertising effects. For while age, as a proxy for \ndevelopmental stage, is central to advertising literacy research, it is rarely discussed in \nthe study of advertising effects. To take a much-cited example, Borzekowski and \nRobinson\u2019s (2001) experiment with 2 to 6 year old children found that those who had \nbeen shown a videotape with advertisements preferred the advertised food items when \ncompared with children who saw the same videotape without advertisements. Viewed \nfrom the perspective of advertising literacy research, one wonders whether such findings \nare specific to pre-school (or pre-operational) children or whether they apply across the \nage range? Did the observed effects occur because these children were too young to \nunderstand the nature and intent underlying advertising or would they be expected at any \nage? Such questions are surprisingly rarely asked. \nBy contrast with the research on literacy, in advertising effects research the \ndecision to study a particular age group is rarely justified in theoretical terms. On the \ncontrary, many studies simply announce the decision to study a particular age group (e.g. \nHitchings & Moynihan, 1998; Lewis & Hill, 1998). Or, they study an age range that \nspans several stages in terms of advertising literacy yet pay little attention to variation \nwithin the sampled age range (e.g. Ross, et al., 1984). Literature reviews further confuse \nthe issue by summarizing the accumulated findings of studies across very different age \ngroups, for example combining findings from experiments on pre-schoolers and surveys \nof teenagers with little attention to the age range encompassed (e.g. Kunkel, 1990). This \nsituation seems to go unnoticed because the approach commonly taken to reviewing the \nfield of children and advertising is first to review literacy research and then, in an \nadjacent but separate section, to review effects research, thereby positioning the two \nbodies of research side by side without directly examining their theoretical or empirical \nrelationship (e.g. Gunter & McAleer, 1997; Kaiser, 2004; Kunkel, et al., 2004; Story & \nFrench, 2004; Valkenburg, 2000; van Evra, 1998; Young, 2003). \n A possible explanation for this surprising inattention to age and literacy in \nadvertising effects research is that the theoretical framework originates with the adult \npopulation and has then been extended to the study of children. This contrasts with the \nstudy of advertising literacy where, as already noted, the theory derives from a post-\nPiagetian account of cognitive child development, extended to the domain of advertising. \nThe dominant approach to advertising effects for adults is that of consumer psychology \nand, for children, consumer socialization, both drawing on the social psychology of \npersuasion. The consumer socialization perspective (Story, Neumark-Sztainer, & French, \n2002) suggests that the factors influencing food choice operate at four distinct levels: \nIndividual (psychosocial, biological and behavioral factors); Interpersonal (family, \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 5 \nfriends and peer networks); Community (accessibility, school food policy and local \nfacilities); and Societal (mass media and advertising, social and cultura l norms, \nproduction and distribution systems and pricing policies). \nIn this approach, age is included as one among many individual differences, but \nits role in mediating the influence of each of these factors is little attended to. Indeed, \noften age is \u2018controlled for\u2019 when not the focus of the study, using statistical techniques \nto partial out the variation associated with age. Consequently, age is often neglected in \ndiscussions of the relative influence of the many factors that influence children\u2019s food \nchoice. For example, in reviewing the field, Derbaix and Bree (1997) identified a range \nof factors known to mediate the effects of advertising in children (involvement, emotion, \nmotivation, etc) but these were treated as individual difference factors that predicted \nchildren\u2019s attitude to the product or brand. The discussion did not refer to children\u2019s age \nor their stage of development in analyzing their response to persuasive messages, for \ninstead of regarding children\u2019s age as a crucial measure of cognitive developmental stage, \nthe consumer socialization approach treats children\u2019s age as an often-incidental \nindividual difference, permitting the researcher to treat studies with very different age \nsamples as equivalent. \n \nThe gap between literacy and effects research \n \nThe lack of integration between advertising literacy and advertising effects \nresearch is not simply a matter of internal consistency in the field. More important, there \nis a widespread assumption, in both academic and policy circles, that the relation between \nthe two is in fact clear and well-established. This \u2018cognitive defense\u2019 view (Kunkel et al., \n2004) asserts that, \u201cthe first defense against a commercial is a cognitive one, i.e. the \nability to understand the informative and persuasive intents\u201d (Derbaix & Bree, 1997, p. \n209). \nThis view has two key consequences. First, those whose literacy is lower are \nassumed to be more susceptible to effects. Second, an increase in media or advertising \nliteracy is assumed to reduce susceptibility to media effects. Since research has \nestablished that younger children are less media literate, they  are repeatedly assumed to \nbe especially vulnerable to the effects of advertising. Yet close examination of the \npublished reviews reveals that rarely is empirical evidence cited in support of this crucial \nclaim (e.g. Lewis & Hill, 1998; Moore & Lutz, 2000; Valkenburg, 2000; van Evra, 1995; \nYoung, 2003). One study sought a relation between literacy and effects failed to find it: \nFox (1981) found differences on cognitive measures (knowledge and understanding, \ndistinguishing programs and adverts) between 4-5 year olds and 9-10 year olds but no age \ndifference in the effect of advertising on behavior. Kunkel et al. (2004) cited just one \nstudy that found media literacy training to reduce advertising effects on product \npreferences (Feshbach et al., 1982). \nMore generally, the research base which could support the claimed linked \nbetween literacy and effects is, at best, \u201cquite mixed\u201d (John, 1999, p. 190). Kunkel et al. \n(2004) concluded their review by noting that they could find no study that examined the \nstatistical relation between children\u2019s understanding of advertising\u2019s persuasive intent \nand the impact of advertising and that, \u201cthere is little evidence that media literacy \ninterventions can effectively counteract the impact of advertising on children of any age, \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 6 \nmuch less the younger ones who are most vulnerable to its influence\u201d (p. 21). Our \nreading of the literature reviews in the field of children\u2019s food choice suggests that this \nconclusion is at least tacitly acknowledged, if only by the significant absence of explicit \ndiscussion linking literacy and effects. \nNotwithstanding the absence of empirical support, the relation between \nadvertising literacy and advertising effects is widely taken for granted. For example, \nWartella (1980, p. 25) expressed the hope that \u201cappropriate learning materials will be \ndeveloped to \u2026 help children overcome their misunderstandings of television messages. \nBy improving the skills children bring to the viewing situation we may be able to \nmoderate the impact television has on the child.\u201d Valkenburg and Cantor (2001) \nproposed that media literacy mitigates the harmful effects of advertising and television \nviewing on the child\u2019s preferences and eating patterns. Dorr brought out the assumed age \neffect when she argued that by adolescence, teenagers\u2019 greater understanding of the \npersuasive techniques of advertisers \u201ccan help children evaluate advertising claims \nsensibly and gain more control over the type and amount of influence commercials exert \non them\u201d (1986, p. 52).  \n \nAcademic research and policy debates \n \nThese and other views from the academy are used to inform policy deliberations. \nFor the assumption that the young are especially vulnerable is the basis on which rest the \nfrequent calls for restrictions or bans on advertising to children. The Committee on \nCommunications (1995) in the US and the National Family and Parenting Institute (2003) \nin the UK are just a few of the many organizations calling for a ban on food advertising \nto children, especially to those younger than eight (e.g. Kaiser 2004; Kunkel, 1990; \nKunkel et al., 2004; Story & French, 2004; Valkenburg, 2000). A second policy \nrecommendation resulting from academic research is the call for media literacy training, \nespecially for younger children, on the assumption that this will reduce the effects of \nadvertising (Committee on Communications, 1995). As Bar-on (2000, p. 291) put it, \npolicy should \u201cpromote media education as a means to help mitigate some of the \nunhealthy effects of television\u201d. \nIn developed countries especially, it seems that age offers a publicly acceptable \npolicy tool for intervening in the promotion of messages targeted at children (Samson, \n2005), both because young children are assumed to be more vulnerable and because \nadvertising to those too young to recognize persuasive intent is unfair (Kunkel, 1990; \nMartin, 1997), this latter claim resting more securely on literacy research. Combined with \nthe call for more media education, the call for regulation is the predominant way in which \ncommunication scholars have sought to influence these lively and often hotly contested \ndebates over advertising to children (Bandyopadhyay, et al., 2001; Hansen, 1997; Kunkel \n& Wilcox, 2001; Kunkel et al., 2004). Our purpose here is neither to undermine that \nattempt nor to defend the advertising industry, but rather to draw the attention of \ncommunication researchers to the empirical and theoretical weakness at the heart of their \nposition in order that it may be addressed effectively. \n \n \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 7 \nClassifying findings of advertising effects by children\u2019s age  \n \nWe have argued that age is widely agreed to be a key factor in relation to media, \nor advertising, literacy, but it is rarely if ever discussed in relation to the effects of \nadvertising. So, can we clarify whether media effects occur evenly across all age groups \nor are they, instead, greater at some ages than others, with older children especially being \nless influenced by the media? Particularly, is the assumption is warranted that younger \nchildren, being less media literate, are especially vulnerable to the influence of \nadvertising? \nAlthough theoretical considerations of advertising effects are pitched at a general \nlevel of abstraction, concerned with cognitive and social processes, empirical research on \nadvertising is, for practical reasons, concerned with specific product domains (food \nchoice, toy preferences, etc). Focusing here on children\u2019s food choices, the published \nresearch was systematically re-examined in relation to children\u2019s age. To identify the \nrange of published research, the analysis drew on the substantial and systematic review \nrecently conducted by Hastings et al. (2003). Hastings et al. employed systematic search \nprocedures to ensure as comprehensive a review as possible, beginning with the \nidentification of nearly 30,000 articles before finally producing a list of some fifty \noriginal empirical studies examining the effects of advertising on children\u2019s food choice. \nAt several stages in the systematic review process, the reliability of the selection process \nwas checked and reported. Consequently, this list of studies was considered satisfactory \nfor the present analysis. \nThe original empirical studies thus identified are classified in Table 1 according to \nthe age sampled. The age bands used follow the main distinctions established in research \non advertising literacy in order to examine the supposed link between literacy and effects. \nClassifying published studies using even such wide age bands proved problematic. It \nseems that samples are often chosen for convenience rather than on theoretical grounds, \nfor they cut across, or overlap, the developmental stages of advertising literacy, and some \narticles reported only the average age, rather than the age range, of the sample. A similar \njudgment had to be made regarding the classification of findings: studies were classified \naccording to whether they reported findings of effects, mixed or weak evidence for \neffects, or no evidence of effects. We offer Table 1, therefore, as suggestive rather than \nconclusive regarding trends in the literature. \nTable 1 suggests that most published studies found evidence of advertising\u2019s \neffects rather than otherwise. Although it can be suggested that journal publication is \nbiased towards studies that show effects, Greenwald (1975) argues that this does not \ninvalidate the conclusions drawn. Notwithstanding continued methodological debate over \nmedia effects (Hearold, 1986; Livingstone, 1996), Table 1 clearly points to the effects of \nadvertising. It is also apparent that there is a paucity of research regarding both younger \nchildren and adolescents. The age group that has been most systematically researched is \nbetween 7 and 12 years old, the transitional age group in terms of the development of \nadvertising literacy. Future research on younger and, especially, older children, would \nprovide a more balanced picture across the age range. \nMost strikingly, the balance of findings by children\u2019s age in Table 1 is \ncounterintuitive. The common-sense prediction is that younger children are more affected \nby advertising, while media-literate teenagers are supposedly the least vulnerable to \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 8 \neffects. The literature suggests a very different picture. Mixed or weak findings are more \ncommon for the youngest age group, while among 7 to 12 year olds and especially among \nteenagers, research is more likely to find evidence of advertising effects.  \nThe findings in Table 1 do not permit us to conclude that younger children are \nmore affected by advertising than are older children. Indeed, given these findings, one \nmight conclude that children younger than seven are the least influenced by advertising \nwhile those over 12 years old are most influenced. However, one might also seek an \nartefactual explanation concerned with methodological issues. Arguably, measures of \nboth advertising exposure and food choice are most difficult and unreliable for the \nyoungest group, thus explaining why findings for the youngest group are the most \ninconsistent (Donohue, Henke, & Donohue, 1980). It is also possible that the research \nmethod employed has a confounding effect, since the literature includes both experiments \nand surveys. Since surveys typically correlate a measure of advertising exposure \n(typically using the proxy measure of amount of television viewed) with a measure of \nfood choice (knowledge, preference, or behavior), the measure of exposure is imprecise \nby comparison with that used in experiments. In experiments, it may fairly be assumed, \nthough it is not always stated, that the exposure is specifically to age-appropriate or, at \nleast, child-oriented advertisements rather than to advertising in general. An artefactual \nexplanation of the counter-intuitive observation that greater effects are found for older \nthan younger children might be warranted if more surveys had been conducted with \nyounger children, the imprecise exposure variable accounting for the mixed findings. We \nexamined this possibility by reclassifying the same studies (see Table 2) and, once again, \nobtained some unexpected findings. \nTable 2 suggests that surveys are more likely to demonstrate effects than are \nexperiments, not that age-appropriate stimuli (as in most experiments) result in more \nadvertising effects. Possibly a mixture of stimuli is more effective. More plausibly, it may \nbe that the greater ecological validity of surveys reveals the effects of media exposure \nmore clearly than experiments, even though the experiments usually focus on advertising \nspecifically rather than television exposure in general, and even though experiments can \ntest causal claims (Hearold, 1986). It could also be argued that surveys measure \nlongitudinal exposure to advertising while experiments only measure short term \nexposure, this causing surveys to be more sensitive to measuring advertising effects. \nHowever, most surveys measure advertising exposure indirectly, through television \nexposure, making it is difficult to separate the effects of general media exposure and \nother confounding variables from the specific effect of advertising exposure.  The key \npoint for our present argument, however, is that the artefactual explanation is not \nsupported. \nLast, we examine the three-way relation between age sampled, method used, and \nfindings obtained, now including references for the classified studies (see Table 3). \nTable 3 adds two key points to the emerging picture. It shows that while both \nexperiments and surveys are used for children under 12, nearly all research on teenagers \nis survey based. Since surveys appear associated with clearer pro-effects findings, and in \norder to examine causal claims in relation to teenagers, it would seem imperative for \nfuture research to conduct experiments with over 12\u2019s before concluding that this age \ngroup is more consistently affected by advertising than younger children. \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 9 \nThe second point revealed by Table 3 is that it is particularly for the 2-6 year olds, \nthat experiments show the least convincing evidence for effects, while surveys are more \nlikely find effects. This led us to re-read, and seek to compare further, those experiments \nwhich do and do not result in evidence of effects. However, no new account for the \ndifferences in findings became apparent to us and nor are they compared and discussed in \nreviews of the literature. \nLeaving this as a question for future research, it would seem appropriate at this \nstage first to reject the assumption that younger children are more influenced by \nadvertising than older children and, second, since we hesitate to draw the opposite \nconclusion (namely that teenagers are more affected by advertising than young children), \nwe draw the conservative conclusion that there is evidence that children of all ages are \naffected by advertising. How then should the relation between age, literacy and effects be \ntheorized? \n \nA single or dual process of persuasion? \n \nIf children of different ages, at different stages of literacy, are all affected by \nadvertising, this must mask some underlying differences in persuasion. This leads us to \nexplore whether different processes of persuasion occur at different ages. Our starting \npoint is to note that the pattern of findings in the literature is consistent with dual process \nmodels of persuasion. The Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion (Petty & \nCacioppo, 1986), a widely-adopted socio-cognitive model, proposes two \u2018routes\u2019 to \npersuasion, each governed by different principles and affected by different factors. \nAlthough developed in the early 1980s, it remains a major framework for explaining \nadvertising effects (Agostinelli & Grube, 2002; Chang, 2002; Chebat, Charlebois, & \nGelinas-Chebat, 2001; Chebat, Vercollier, & Gelinas-Chebat, 2003; Coulter, 2005; \nCoulter & Punj, 2004; Scholten, 1996; Whittler & Spira, 2002). Yet it has rarely been \napplied to research with children or to distinguish between persuasion processes at \ndifferent stages in development, as we propose here. \nThe Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion proposes that when people pay \nattention to the content of the message, they will weigh and elaborate the arguments \noffered, being persuaded by the message only if they consider the arguments for the \nopinion or product convincing (this Petty and Cacioppo termed the \u2018central route\u2019 to \npersuasion). If, however, people remain relatively unengaged by the message content, \nthey may still be persuaded by a single characteristic of a message as the status or \ncredibility of its source (e.g. expert, celebrity) or the intensity of the message (e.g. color, \nsound, emotion), provided they find these appealing (this is termed the \u2018peripheral route\u2019 \nto persuasion). A similar model, the Heuristic-Systematic Model (Eagly & Chaiken, \n1993), states that under some conditions, people process the arguments in a persuasive \nmessage systematically and carefully, but that at other times, they take cognitive \u2018short-\ncuts\u2019, using a range of cognitive heuristics or simple decision rules in responding to the \nmessage. \nSince the central (or systematic) route to persuasion relies on the person engaging \ncognitively with the message, elaborating it by checking, interpreting, amplifying, etc., \nthis process has been found to have longer lasting effects than the peripheral (or heuristic) \nroute, which relies on more superficial or single-dimensional cues and where the \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 10 \nlikelihood of elaborating the message is much lower. In other words, for both persuasion \nprocesses to work, the person must pay attention, but the quality of the attention is \ndifferent, and therefore so are the consequences.  \nWhat conditions make the difference? Motivation and ability are crucial. \nResearch suggests that if people are motivated to attend to the message, which depends in \nturn on whether they consider it likely to be personally relevant to them, and if people \nhave the ability to engage with the message, which in this context we might reframe in \nterms of media literacy, then the central route becomes more likely. Persuasion thus \ndepends on the nature of the message (the strength of the arguments, the quality of the \ncontent, etc). If the person lacks either motivation or ability (or, is low in media literacy), \nthe quality of the arguments matters less, and persuasion will only occur if the message \nappeals through its incidental features (Chebat  et al., 2001; Scholten, 1996; Whittler & \nSpira, 2002). \nContrary to the commonsense view of advertising, these models of persuasion do \nnot assume that if a person is knowledgeable about or critical of advertising, they will not \nbe persuaded. Indeed, a skeptical approach could result in even greater persuasion, \nprovided the person is motivated and interested in the message content and provided the \narguments in the message are strong. Nor do they assume that if someone pays little \nattention, they will not be persuaded. Rather, the object of their attention and the quality \nof that attention is more important than the amount of attention. If they do not attend to \nthe arguments, more superficial features (e.g. a celebrity endorsement or an intensely \nappealing or attractive image) may catch their eye, resulting in a less enduring but still \nsignificant form of persuasion. If they attend to the arguments, those superficial features \nmay matter less. Further, if a person attends to the arguments (the central\/strategic route) \nbut the arguments are found to be weak, there is an effect but the opposite of that desired \nby the advertiser: the person develops a negative view of the product, and this negative \nperception will persist for longer than a negative impression established through the \nperipheral route. \n \nThe dual process model and the relation between age, literacy and effects  \n \nApplying this model to the domain of advertising food to children, we suggest \nthat younger children are more likely to be persuaded by the peripheral route, while \nteenagers are more likely to be persuaded by the central route. Based on research \npresented earlier, it can be hypothesized that less media literate viewers (generally \nyounger children) are more interested in such superficial or peripheral features of \nadvertising as celebrity sources, jingles, colorful, and entertaining images (Kunkel et al., \n2004; John, 1999; Bridges  et al., 2004; Dalmeny, 2003; Carruth, Skinner, Moran, & \nColetta, 2000; Valkenburg & Cantor, 2001). Indeed, research suggests that television \nwatching by children under the age of eight is focused on perceptual stimuli rather than \non semantic information in a message (Hoffner & Cantor, 1985; Hoffner, Cantor, & \nThornson, 1989). Or, as others have argued, under about six years old, children obey the \nprinciple of \u2018centration\u2019, reacting to a single prominent attribute of a product (e.g. color \nor sound) to determine whether they like it or not (Carruth, Skinner, Moran, & Coletta, \n2000; Valkenburg & Cantor, 2001). \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 11 \nOn the other hand, it can also be hypothesized that more media literate (or older \nchildren and adults) are more attentive to the creativity or informative nature of the \ncommercial or to the value of the product in their lives and are thereby more influenced \nby the quality of the arguments and claims of advertising, providing that they attend, are \nmotivated to engage with the message, and that its arguments are convincing. Writing \nabout adult audiences, Hawkins and Pingree (1987, p. 462) concurred that cognitive \neffort and attention may increase, rather than reduce, effects: \u201dSome cognitive effort \nwhile viewing may increase learning, comprehension, or the isomorphism between \ntelevision content or viewer beliefs and behaviors. In other cases, cognitive effort may \ndecrease learning from television or increase the likelihood of beliefs opposed to those \npresented on television.\u201d \nKim and Rubin (1997) also challenged the association between increased literacy \nand reduced effects by distinguishing between different kinds of attention when they \nconclude that, \u201cthe facilitative activity of selectivity, attention, and involvement served as \na catalyst to media effects, whereas the inhibitory activity of avoidance and skepticism \nserved as a deterrent\u201d (p. 120). This invites an opposition not of naivety versus critical \nawareness but of motivated attention versus skeptical distance thus combining the \ncognitive aspect of media literacy with the motivational considerations that direct \nattention and cognitive effort. More generally, as proposed by both information \nprocessing approaches and audience reception studies, work on adults commonly asserts \nthat there are several elements of a message that can have an effect (Eagly & Chaiken, \n1993; Livingstone, 1998) and that these may or may not \u2018fit\u2019 with the ways that audiences \nrespond to the message. This places a cognitive\/interpretive demand on the audience \nwhich, in turn, plays a key mediating role in processes of persuasion. Literacy and effects \nmust be, therefore, theoretically linked. \nAlthough such insights seem not to have been applied to thinking about children\u2019s \ncomprehension or media literacy, the possibility for such development is promising. In \nreframing our understanding of the cognitive development of advertising literacy, so as to \nlink it to the consumer socialization literature, John (1999) described the information \nprocessing of 3-7 year olds as \u2018limited\u2019, unidimensional, and focused on perceptual \nfeatures, while she characterizes teenagers\u2019 response to advertising (11-16 years) as \n\u2018reflective\u2019 and \u2018strategic\u2019. Although John assumed a single process of persuasion, her \naccount fits the dual process model better, with the limited stage of advertising literacy \nmapping onto peripheral processing for the youngest children and with the reflective \nstage of literacy mapping onto central route processing for teenagers. For 7 to 11 year \nolds, on whom most effects research concentrates, we also find an explanation for the \nmixed findings obtained. In this stage, children are gaining an understanding of the \npersuasive intent of advertising but they do not always use it. In literacy terms, John \n(1999) labeled them \u2018analytical\/cued\u2019, for they must be cued to use their developing \nanalytical skills. In effects terms, however, much rests on whether the experimental \nsituation does, in practice, cue these skills, a key issue not addressed in research reports. \n \nAge-targeted advertising \n \nSince research reports are often uninformative regarding the advertising strategy \nemployed in the stimulus materials to which experimental subjects are exposed (what is \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 12 \nthe target age group, do the advertisements seek to persuade through the \ncentral\/argumentative or peripheral\/attractive route?), the inconsistent body of findings \nobtained is hardly surprising. Although it is not possible retrospectively, based on reports \nof published studies, to test our proposal that different routes to persuasion are more \neffective for different age groups, this would seem to open up a promising direction for \nfuture empirical research. Too often in the literature on both literacy and effects, \n\u2018advertising\u2019 remains a generic category, neglecting the possibility that children of \ndifferent ages are targeted by different tactics, especially those that precisely take into \naccount their growing literacy\/skepticism. Future research could and should examine this \npossibility. \nThe value of different advertising strategies targeted on different age groups is not \nlost on advertisers themselves. Indeed, it must be that advertisers would not target \nteenagers (and adults) if media literacy simply undermines media effects. Arguably, an \nexamination of advertising practice reveals an at-least implicit recognition (characterized \nas \u201cencoding\/decoding problems in advertising to children\u201d; McNeal, 1992, p. 147) as \nthat persuasion works in different ways for different age groups. Typically, \nadvertisements for younger children seek to appeal through bright colors, fast pace, lively \nmusic and simple messages, often emphasizing the physical aspects of the product (Lewis \n& Hill, 1998). Advertisements for teenagers emphasize witty or stylish imagery, subtle \nmessages, and references to peer group approval. Advertisers\u2019 strategies to reach children \ndiffer from adult strategies in that they focus on new and exciting features to encourage \npurchase requests rather than on building brand loyalty (Bridges, Briesch, & Yim, 2004). \nFor younger children, this exciting feature may be incidental to the product (e.g. a give-\naway toy). For older children, it may be a celebrity endorsement of the product \n(Dalmeny, 2003). For teenagers, who behave more like adults, information in the images \nis, supposedly, more salient and they are seen as being more likely to develop brand \nloyalties (Bridges, Briesch, & Yim, 2004). \n \nRevisiting anomalies in the empirical literature \n \nThe present proposal to apply the dual process theory of persuasion to the study of \nchildren and advertising resolves some puzzles and anomalies in the literature (Kuhn, \n1962). For these are only puzzling, and so neglected, in the context of the theoretical \nconsensus that younger children are more vulnerable to advertising than older children, \nand we suggest that these contradictory findings fit rather well with a dual process theory \nof persuasion. For example, Moore and Lutz (2000) found greater (not lesser) effects of \nadvertising for children older then 11 than for younger children, noting that older children \nwere also more attentive to advertising than were 7-8 year olds and that they approached \nadvertising from a variety of different angles (entertainment, information, etc) while \nyounger children use less elaborate strategies suggestive of peripheral route processing. \nAlthough little research has examined the role of source credibility, Ross et al.\u2019s (1984; \nsee also van Evra, 1998) much-cited study found that children older than 11 were less \ninfluenced by celebrity endorsement than those aged eight to ten. The younger children \nwere more impressed by images of adult authority and more influenced by perceptual \ndistortions of the product in the advertisements, again supporting the argument that \nperipheral route processing is more typical of younger than older children. \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 13 \nA study by Chan (2001) found that perceived truthfulness in advertisements \ndeclines steadily with age (from 5 to 12) but that liking for and attention to advertising \ndoes not. Similarly, Lewis and Hill (1998) noted that as children become more cynical \ntowards advertising they continue to be influenced. Though they offer no explanation for \nthis, we have noted earlier that central route processing can result, depending on the \nquality of the arguments offered, in both increased influence and increased negative \nresponses to advertising, with the consequence that an overall assessment of responses to \nadvertising can mask differences in response to particular advertisements. \nConsistent with the suggestion that central route processing is more typical of \nteenagers, Gunter and McAleer (1997) argued that teens are more influenced by \nadvertising when they are highly motivated to attend to it (while John & Lakshmi-Ratan, \n1992, found no such effect for younger children). They also point out that, consistent \nwith the Elaboration Likelihood Model, this stronger influence of central cues in older \nchildren can express itself in a stronger, more stable opinion either in favor or against the \nproduct promoted by the message (this accounting for the puzzling mixture of observable \neffects plus skeptical responses of teenagers in advertising research). Indeed, one \nresolution of the positive correlation between adolescents\u2019 skepticism towards advertising \nand the amount of time spent viewing television (this latter in turn also being correlated \nwith effects such as obesity) (see Lewis & Hill, 1998; Mangleburg & Bristol, 1998), is \nthat for teens to be influenced, the central route (which precisely relies on their skeptical \napproach) is used over the peripheral one. \nLastly, Edens and McCormick (2000) found that adolescents continue to be \ninfluenced by advertising, despite their greater skepticism when compared with younger \nchildren, and they identify some of the factors that affect teens\u2019 responses to \nadvertisements, including conditions that encourage high or low argument-elaboration. \nSpecifically, teens in a high-elaboration processing condition recalled more details from \nthe advertisements, though many remained more sensitive to the peripheral details than to \nthe central message of the commercial. \n \nConclusion \n \nThis article has argued that the evidence on children\u2019s responses to advertising \ndoes not support the widely held belief that younger children are more influenced by \nadvertising. Rather, the evidence is consistent with the view that different processes of \npersuasion operate at different ages, precisely because literacy levels vary by age. In \nshort, we have suggested children of all ages could be, more or less equivalently, affected \nby advertising, but that the effects of advertising are dependent on advertising literacy. \nThus, our hypothesis is that, because younger children have lower media (or advertising) \nliteracy, they are more likely to be persuaded by advertising that is based on celebrities, \njingles, colorful images, and attractive physical features of a product. Older children, \nespecially teenagers, whose media literacy is greater, are more likely to be persuaded by \nadvertising strategies based on argumentation,  especially those that contain high quality \narguments and responses to counterarguments. \nIf it was ever the case that younger children were more vulnerable to advertising \nthan teenagers and adults, the huge expansion of the advertising and marketing industry \nin recent decades would seem to have led to the development of distinctive strategies to \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 14 \nappeal to, argue to, and persuade its very different audiences, with the consequence that \nacross the age range, advertising has been shown to have effects. Thus, we have \nexamined the possibility that dual process models of persuasion could be more insightful \nin understanding the responses of children of different ages than is the assumption of a \nsingle persuasion process. The evidence regarding advertising effects by age fits better \nwith a mapping of the advertising literacy of older and younger children onto the central \nand peripheral processes of persuasion respectively, than it fits the popular assumption \nthat less literacy means more effects. \nThis argument identifies some promising directions for future research in this \nfield, for we need a better understanding of the conditions under which children and \nteenagers of all ages are influenced by advertising. As noted earlier, more research on the \nyoungest and oldest age groups is needed to balance that on those in the transitional \nliteracy age group and, especially the lack of experimental research on teenagers must be \nrectified. The age groups sampled in effects research should be theory-driven, clarifying \nthe level of media literacy attained by the children and the appropriateness of this to the \npersuasive process hypothesized to mediate observed effects. In describing the nature of \nthe persuasive message in effects research, it is vital also to characterize this in terms of \npersuasion theory (whether it is age-appropriate or not, the persuasive strategies \nemployed, whether these favor central or peripheral processing, the presence of cues for \nthe application of literacy skills, the children\u2019s attention, etc.). The dual process theory \nalso suggests some new hypotheses, for example that advertising effects will last longer \nfor older children, that source credibility will be more influential with younger children, \nthat including weak versus strong arguments in the message will make more difference \nfor older children, and so forth.  \nLastly, this argument invites a reinterpretation not only of the existing body of \nresearch but also of its policy implications. It is now imperative to conduct interventions \nthat seek to increase levels of media literacy and then evaluate these in relation to the \nhypothesized reduction of effects. Hobbs and Frost (2003) show that media literacy \ntraining can stimulate critical thinking, so that after media literacy training, students were \nable to identify information that was implicit or omitted in advertising; however, such \ncritical thinking was not actually used unless directly activated by media literacy training \nor when explicitly invited of the young people. As yet, there is little evidence to suggest \nthat if media literacy is increased, media effects are necessarily reduced. Moreover, one \nmight argue that for teenagers, interventions should be less focused on media literacy and \nmore focused on directly countering the arguments of advertising (for example through \nconsumer awareness, provision of alternative food messages, and health information). \nFor younger children, the use of celebrities, cartoon favorites, and familiar characters \nfrom programs in advertising should be better researched (Giles & Maltby, 2004) and \nthen, perhaps, restricted (as in Swedish restrictions on advertising to children; Konsument \nVerket, 2004). \nReturning, then, to the present crisis over children\u2019s food choice and rising levels \nof obesity, we have tried to redirect the discussion away from the often unproductive \ndebates over research methods towards improving the theory. Research is always open to \nchallenge in terms of the details of sample, stimulus materials, the conduct of statistical \nanalyses, etc (e.g. Livingstone, 2004; Paliwoda & Crawford, 2003) but can perhaps be \nmore influential if empirical research is clearly theory-driven, internally consistent, and \nDoes advertising literacy mediate the effects of advertising on children? 15 \ncoherent. We have suggested that a more satisfactory account than is commonly given is \nalready warranted by the apparently-contradictory findings in the published literature, \nand invite researchers in the field to put a dual process model, linking age-targeted \nadvertising strategies, a developmental account of advertising literacy and distinct \ncognitive processes of persuasion, to the test. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAgostinelli, G., & Grube, J.
