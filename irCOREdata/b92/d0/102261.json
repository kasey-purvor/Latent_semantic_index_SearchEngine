A case study analysis \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nIt is acknowledged that families face a formidable burden in caring for a relative with \nserious mental illness (Cook et al., 1994; Hatfield, 1978; Hoenig & Hamilton, 1966; \nHorwitz & Reinhard, 1995; Pariante & Carpiniello, 1996;  Thompson & Doll, 1982).  \nCaring for a son or daughter with a mental illness involves unique financial, social and \nemotional burdens (Crotty & Krulys, 1986; Doll, 1976; Gubman & Tessler, 1987; Hatfield, \n1987; Maurin & Boyd, 1990; Potasznik & Nelson, 1984).  These are due mainly to the \nspecific changes in behaviour that parents experience in their son or daughter which \ninclude withdrawal, psychotic symptoms, behavioural excesses and impaired social \nperformance (Birchwood & Smith, 1987). \n \nIt has been suggested that part of the burden for parents of (adult) children with \nschizophrenia involves dealing with feelings of loss and grief (Atkinson, 1994; Chafetz & \nBarnes, 1989; Davis & Schultz, 1998; MacGregor, 1994; McElroy, 1987; Miller, 1996; \nParker, 1993; Ryan, 1993; Solomon & Draine, 1996).  This suggestion arises from the \nbelief that, with the onset of schizophrenic symptoms, parents experience a perceived loss \nof the pre-morbid version of their child, a loss of their child\u2019s potential (Davis & Schultz, \n1998; Ryan, 1993) and therefore the loss of hopes and aspirations for their child\u2019s future \n(Miller, 1996; Parker, 1993).  Conceptualising these experiences as a loss - termed by \nMiller (1996) a \u2018psychic loss\u2019 - may not be straightforward, however, due to the insidious \n 4\nand cyclical nature of the illness and periodic reappearances of the child\u2019s \u2018former self\u2019.  \nDetailed parental accounts of their responses to a son or daughter with schizophrenia are \ntherefore required to explore the validity of this conceptualisation. \n \nIf parental responses can be conceptualised in terms of loss, there may be some overlap \nbetween parental experiences and the experience of grief following a bereavement, \nalthough the continued physical presence of the son or daughter means that one experiential \ndomain does not map exactly onto the other (Solomon & Draine, 1996).  An understanding \nof the grieving process, prompted by Freud\u2019s (1917) seminal paper Mourning and \nMelancholia, led western psychotherapeutic approaches to claim that \u2018grief work\u2019 is \nessential for the resolution of grief (Davy, 1998).  The work of many authors, spanning \nmuch of the twentieth century, sought to develop this \u2018grand theory\u2019, including Bowlby \n(1969, 1973, 1980), Lindemann (1944, 1979), Parkes (1965, 1980, 1985, 1993, 1998) and \nWorden (1991, 1996).  Therapeutic approaches are said to facilitate grief work by \nconcentrating on making the loss \u2018real\u2019, to enable detachment from the deceased and \nengagement in new relationships (see Raphael & Nunn, 1988).  \n \nThroughout the 1990s, however, Margaret Stroebe and colleagues have undertaken \nliterature reviews and empirical studies which call into question the grief work hypothesis \n(e.g., Schut et al., 1997; Stroebe, 1992, 1994, 1998; Stroebe et al., 1994).  She suggests that \nthere is insufficient empirical evidence to confirm the claims of theorists who subscribe to \nthis idea.  From this body of research, she developed a new model of coping with loss \ncalled the \u2018Dual Process Model\u2019 (Stroebe, 1998).  In essence, this suggests that the \navoidance of grief work - which she termed \u2018restoration-orientation\u2019 - can be useful if \noscillation occurs between this and the \u2018real\u2019 work or working through of grief - which she \n 5\ntermed \u2018loss-orientation\u2019.  This model, however, may prove problematic if used in cases \nwhere experiences of loss are complex.  Miller (1996) acknowledged the usefulness of \nstage models in facilitating complex grief work when he took Worden\u2019s (1991) four-task \nmodel of grief and adapted the last two tasks to develop a model specifically to address the \nsense of loss to mental illness.  These tasks were transformed into \u2018accommodations to the \nloss via relationships outside that with the mentally ill relative\u2019 and \u2018accommodations to the \nloss via the relationship with the mentally ill relative\u2019 (p. 633).  Although researchers have \nempirically explored loss and grief among parents of people with schizophrenia (Atkinson, \n1994; Davis & Schultz, 1998; Miller et al., 1990; Solomon & Draine, 1996), not only has \nlittle attention been paid to the actual conceptualisation of loss but also no qualitative work \nhas been undertaken specifically in the area of \u2018psychic loss\u2019.  \n \nThe aim of the present study was to explore parental responses to having a child diagnosed \nwith schizophrenia, with the research being informed by existing models of grief.  In this \nstudy, we use the term \u2018child\u2019 and \u2018children\u2019 to refer to offspring, regardless of their age, \nalthough we are aware of the danger of such terms infantilising those to whom they refer.  \nThe study involved elaborating parents\u2019 understanding of and responses to their children\u2019s \nschizophrenia and exploring whether these responses could reasonably be interpreted and \nunderstood in terms of loss and grief.  The intention was to use the research findings to \nidentify therapeutic interventions which could help parents resolve problematic feelings \nabout their children with schizophrenia.  \n \n \nMethod \n \n 6\nParticipants \nParents of people who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia were recruited through the \nNational Schizophrenia Fellowship (NSF), an organisation which aims to help people with \nserious mental illness, their families and carers.  Local group co-ordinators in one \ngeographical area (Surrey) were provided with information about the study and were asked \nto invite members to take part.  Four parents agreed to participate. \n \nInterview Schedule \nData were collected through interviews, using a semi-structured interview schedule to elicit \ninformation relating to parents\u2019 responses to their son or daughter\u2019s condition and whether \nthey experienced their son or daughter\u2019s condition in terms of loss.  Questions were \ncarefully designed to avoid leading participants into simply complying with this \nconstruction of their experiences.  For example, the possibility that parents might construct \ntheir child\u2019s condition in various ways was presented and then parents were invited to \nreflect upon how they thought of their child\u2019s condition and of the life changes associated \nwith it.  Participants were asked to provide a history of their child\u2019s condition, including \ntheir emotional and practical reactions to this, how they coped with any negative feelings \nand what support (if any) they received from others. \n \nProcedure \nTwo participants were interviewed in their homes and two were interviewed at the \nresearchers\u2019 university base.  Interviews were conducted by the first author and lasted 55-\n80 minutes.  Before the interviews, all participants signed a consent form and completed a \ndemographic information questionnaire.  Due to the sensitive nature of  the research topic \nand the potential for the interview to cause distress for participants, interviews were \n 7\nundertaken using a basic counselling-style format, following the recommendations of Coyle \n(1998).  On completion of the interview, each participant was offered a follow-up \ncounselling session to talk through any feelings of distress.  No participant availed of this \noffer.  Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. \n  \nAnalytic Strategy \nAn idiographic approach was adopted in the analysis of the interview data, analysing each \ncase individually in order to produce detailed accounts of parental responses.  Although \nthere has been a tradition of using clinical case studies in psychology, a decline in their use \nin research occurred in the middle part of the twentieth century (Runyan, 1982).  A revival \nof interest, however, can be observed more recently in the work of writers and researchers \nsuch as Jones (1993), Josselson and Lieblich (1993), McAdams (1988) and Smith (1990, \n1991) and colleagues (Smith et al., 1995). \n \nThe data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) (Smith, \n1996; Smith et al., 1997, 1999).  This method of analysis is concerned with developing an \n\u2018insider\u2019s perspective\u2019 (Conrad, 1987) on participants\u2019 experiences and concentrates on the \nmeanings that they attach to their experiences.  It requires the detailed analysis of accounts \nof experiences offered by small samples, with the aim being to say something meaningful \nabout the cognitions and emotions which are reflected in these accounts. \n \nThe analysis involved examining the transcript of each interview in detail.  During repeated \nreadings of each transcript, notes were made of significant or interesting points related to \nthe research topic.  These notes formed the basis for emergent themes which encapsulated \nthe essence of significant points within the participant\u2019s account.  These relatively fine-\n 8\ngrained themes were then amalgamated where possible into more analytic \u2018superordinate \nthemes\u2019.  However, steps were taken to ensure that these themes remained grounded in the \nparticipant\u2019s account by checking for evidence in the transcript which would support the \nthemes.  Although each transcript was analysed on an individual basis, inevitably the \nanalysis of previous cases influenced the analysis of subsequent ones to some degree. \n \nIPA recognises that the research product necessarily represents the outcome of a dynamic \ninteraction between participants\u2019 accounts and the researchers\u2019 interpretative frameworks \n(Smith et al., 1999).  It is therefore necessary to reflect upon the researchers\u2019 interpretative \nframeworks in relation to this topic and the ways in which these frameworks may have \ninfluenced the analysis.  The interpretations of the first author (who conducted the \nfieldwork and the bulk of the analysis) will have been shaped primarily by his position as a \ncounselling psychologist in training and by his work with people with schizophrenia and \ntheir carers in clinical practice.  The second author (who helped guide the research design, \ndirected the analysis and checked interpretations) is a social psychologist who has \nconducted research in the field of bereavement which helped to inform his contribution.  It \ncould be argued that the analysis of participants\u2019 accounts within such interpretative \nframeworks \u2013 far from resulting in a research product tainted by the researchers\u2019 \nsubjectivity \u2013 produced an analysis that made constructive use of informed subjectivities.  \nAll interpretations offered by the first author were checked by the second author in the hope \nthat this would enable unwarranted, idiosyncratic interpretations to be identified and \nremoved.  In addition, all major interpretations are illustrated by quotations from the \ninterviews, thereby demonstrating the basis for these interpretations and enabling readers to \nassess their persuasiveness for themselves.  \n \n 9\nIn the quotations presented in the analysis, information within square brackets has been \nadded for clarification and ellipsis points (\u2026) indicate where words or a passage have been \nomitted from the original quotations.  All identifying information, such as names and \nlocations, have been changed to pseudonyms to protect the confidentiality of the \nparticipants. \n \nNote that on occasions, participants talked not only about their experiences but also about \nthe experiences of other family members.  Although the accuracy of this data is open to \nquestion because of its second-hand nature, it will sometimes be included in the analysis as \nit provides some indication of the extent to which the family system can be challenged by \naccommodating a person with schizophrenia.  However, readers should treat this data with \ncaution. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nCase Study One: Jean   \nJean is 54 years old and is married to the father of her three children.  They live with their \nson, Timothy (22) who was diagnosed with schizophrenia one year ago. He has displayed \nsymptoms of schizophrenia for four years during which time Jean has been his main carer.  \nHer younger daughter is at university and her other daughter is married.  \nUncertainty prior to diagnosis  \nJean described a long period of time between first observing her son\u2019s difficult behaviour \nand his diagnosis of schizophrenia.  This was described as a period of three years of not \nknowing what the cause of his behaviour was.  She explained that an earlier diagnosis \n 10\nwould have provided her with a better understanding of his behaviour and also how to react \nto his criticisms.  When incidents occurred with her son, she \u2018put it down to the behaviour \nfrom this incident [a fight Timothy was involved in] more than thinking \u201cThis is a mental \nillness.\u201d  I can honestly say it wasn\u2019t until the breakdown and he was put into hospital that \nwe ever thought he was mentally ill.\u2019  It would seem that Jean had initially interpreted this \nunusual behaviour as a manifestation of temporary destabilisation instead of the first sign of \nmental illness (Terkelsen, 1987).  Later in the interview, she explained that in retrospect \nshe began to \u2018pull the wool over my eyes\u2019 to guard herself from admitting it was mental \nillness.  She went on to explain that \u2018you are confronted with a situation in which you just \nthink the person involved has just totally gone against the family\u2026the total trauma for \nparents.\u2019. \n \nInterpreting the illness in terms of loss \nIn the early stages of the illness, Jean said that she perceived a change in her son.  She \ndescribed him as a \u2018very different son and a son, oddly enough, who had been so laid back \nand such an easy going personality.\u2019  It would seem from this that Jean felt that her son\u2019s \nformer self had receded.  She confirmed this later in the interview when, unprompted, she \nexplained that having a son with schizophrenia was like a \u2018bereavement because one felt \none had lost the person one knew\u2026almost like a living death.\u2019  Note here the use of the \ngeneral term \u2018one\u2019 instead of the more personal \u2018I\u2019: this could be interpreted as a rhetorical \ndistancing of herself from a situation which would be too painful to talk about in personal \nterms.  Such a loss has been conceptualised in the literature on carers of people with mental \nillness as a \u2018psychic loss\u2019 (Miller, 1996), in which the person lives on but the relationship \nchanges profoundly.  This was illustrated when Jean explained that \u2018his symptoms started \nto get worse, his relations with us broke down completely.\u2019  For Jean, her loss involved the \n 11\nloss of aspirations for her son, including his academic potential and his future happiness.  \nShe reported that \u2018he did actually have a good brain so it was a little frustrating to see him, \nas we perceived it, as losing all his talents.\u2019  It is possible that the family therapy which \nJean and her family were attending at the time of the interview led to her conceptualising \nher experiences in terms of loss.  She suggested that \u2018this [the conceptualisation of her \nexperiences in terms of bereavement] did come out very much\u2019 in therapy. \n \nAlthough in one of her comments (cited earlier) Jean implied that she felt her son\u2019s former \nself had been \u2018lost\u2019, elsewhere she described this former self as \u2018trapped\u2019 because on \noccasions he would \u2018laugh and carry on just like he used to\u2019.  Jean went on to explain that \n\u2018it\u2019s like a blinding glimpse of life...you think [sigh] \u201cThat\u2019s the person we used to know \nand love.\u201d\u2019  McElroy (1987) claimed that this periodic reappearance of the \u2018former self\u2019 \nserves to prolong periods of bereavement.  It would seem, however, that Jean \nconceptualises these glimpses as a sign of hope for the return of her son\u2019s pre-morbid self: \n\u2018there is a good, possibly sixty per cent of the person does return... what is different is the \nlifestyle you lead.\u2019  This perhaps indicates that although she feels that she has lost the pre-\nmorbid version of her son, she still has expectations that the majority of his former self will \nreturn and therefore perhaps in one sense the loss is \u2018unreal\u2019 or temporary to her. \n \nEmotional reactions  \nDuring the initial stages of her son\u2019s illness, prior to his diagnosis, Jean recalled feeling \n\u2018extremely distressed\u2019 due to her son\u2019s verbal abuse towards her.  She has since found that \nthis abuse was a reaction to voices that he was hearing.  She also alluded to her frustration \nover Timothy\u2019s stubbornness, suggesting that he would not see \u2018anybody else\u2019s point of \nview\u2019 and also his alienation from the family: \u2018he came down to eat, he was totally silent, \n 12\nshoved his plate to one side and you couldn\u2019t communicate with him.\u2019  It has been \nsuggested that such behaviour directed at carers may be very difficult to cope with \n(Gibbons et al., 1984; MacCarthy, 1988). \n \nFollowing her son\u2019s diagnosis, Jean reported that her initial emotion was one of shock, \ndescribing it as \u2018a bit earth shattering\u2019.  She also described a feeling of  \u2018flatness\u2019.  These \nemotions were said to have given way to feelings of guilt, which seemed to lead to self-\nblame.  Jean explained that these \u2018enormous feelings of guilt\u2019 were due to looking back and \nthinking \u2018if I hadn\u2019t had done that [argued], perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have got so stressed.\u2019  She \nreported that Timothy\u2019s father also felt guilty about how he had dealt with his son.  It \nwould appear that this guilt may have led them to blame each other: \u2018it\u2019s human nature - \nyou accuse the other person - \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t have been so strict this wouldn\u2019t have \nhappened\u201d\u2026\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been so lenient that would have happened.\u201d\u2019 Jean went on to \nexpress the view that the friction that this caused \u2018can pull relationships apart.\u2019 It has been \nsuggested in the bereavement literature that similar emotions of guilt are experienced by \nparents who have developmentally disabled children and experience grief reactions \n(Olshansky, 1962).  The expression of these emotions, Worden (1991) suggests, are a vital \npart of the second task in his reminiscence phase, that of expressing overt and latent affect.  \nSuch experiences of loss can have serious adverse consequences amongst couples (Cook & \nOltjenbruns, 1989; Kohner & Henley, 1992; Long, 1992; Schatz, 1986).    \n \nCoping with the loss \nJean reported that each family member dealt with Timothy\u2019s changing behaviour in \ndifferent ways.  Her husband was said to have \u2018distanced himself psychologically\u2019 and \nconcentrated his thoughts on work, a response often associated with fathers coping with \n 13\nloss (Doka & Martin, 1998; Forrest, 1983; Littlewood et al., 1991).  Jean explained that \nother family members also distanced themselves.  She made this easier for them by limiting \nher communication with them about Timothy.  This represents a standard strategy for \nprotecting others from an unpleasant event (Rando, 1986).  Further evidence of this came \nwhen Jean explained that she has \u2018never actually told my mother\u2026as she\u2019s 80 next year\u2026I \nfeel fundamentally she wouldn\u2019t cope.\u2019  She concluded by remarking that it is \u2018interesting \nhow you sort of protect your own circle.\u2019  It has been suggested that this may engender an \ninability to grieve appropriately for both the protector and protected (Mander, 1994).  Jean \nsaid that she gained support from her church, as a place \u2018one could go and be quiet\u2019, and \nshe found her son\u2019s community psychiatric nurse \u2018extremely helpful\u2019, as she was able to \n\u2018get a bit of a relationship going\u2019 with him.  She also expressed her distress to her younger \ndaughter who was said to have \u2018just been absolutely incredible.  I suppose with her training \n[psychology graduate] she was the best person.  She was better than my husband\u2026she must \nhave been broken hearted herself.\u2019  This quotation illustrates how important Jean found it to \ndiscuss her son with a close family member. \n \nAdjusting to the loss \nIn her adjustment to the loss of \u2018the person one knew\u2019, Jean talked about having \u2018your own \nlife as well\u2026I mean our life has become totally altered due to the situation, which one does \nwillingly because he\u2019s our son and we love him dearly, but there\u2019s got to be an element of \nus attaining our lives as well.\u2019  From this quotation it would seem that she has tried to \ncontinue to live her own life with her husband, yet despite this attempt, Jean finds it \ndifficult as illustrated in the following remark: \u2018He\u2019ll often be there in the evening on his \nown\u2026that is heartbreaking and it\u2019s even worse if we go out\u2026you feel really guilty for \ngoing out, thinking \u201cWell why should we be going out for the evening enjoying \n 14\nourselves?\u201d\u2019 This may reflect Jean\u2019s difficulty in adjusting to the new post-diagnosis \nversion of her son. \n \nCase Study Two: Amy  \nAmy is 66 years old, currently lives on her own and became a widow following her \nhusband\u2019s suicide ten years ago.  She has a daughter and two sons.  Her eldest son, Ian (34) \nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia 16 years ago after graduating from Cambridge \nUniversity.  Up until three years ago, he lived at home.  He currently lives locally in \nsupported housing and Amy sees him once a fortnight.  During the interview, Amy \nappeared reluctant to talk about her emotional responses to her son\u2019s condition and tended \nto change the subject when the topic of emotional responses was raised. \n \nResisting the diagnosis \nAlthough it would seem that Amy accepts that her son has an illness, she reported that she \ndoes not accept her son\u2019s diagnosis of schizophrenia, explaining that \u2018it\u2019s hard to accept, \nerm, even now I can\u2019t accept it fully.\u2019  She went on to suggest that she thinks it \u2018may be \nsomething like Asperger\u2019s syndrome\u2026I\u2019ve read a lot of books about it\u2026and the symptoms \nof that seem to fit his case exactly.  He\u2019s not a split personality at all.  I know he\u2019s had \nconfused thoughts but all the other symptoms are to do with Asperger\u2019s syndrome.\u2019  Here \nshe seems to justify her questioning of the diagnosis of schizophrenia firstly by invoking \nthe popular representation of schizophrenia as \u2018split personality\u2019 and distancing her son \nfrom this and secondly by constructing his symptoms as only partly overlapping with those \nof schizophrenia.  It would seem that another reason why she does not interpret her son\u2019s \nbehaviour in terms of schizophrenia and asks the question \u2018Is it possible they [the \npsychiatrists] have made the wrong diagnosis?\u2019 is because \u2018he manipulates the doctors and \n 15\npsychiatrists.\u2019  This was illustrated later when she explained that \u2018knowing how \nmanipulative he is and clever, I think he\u2019s quite capable of putting on the symptoms - not to \nstart with because I think it was a nervous breakdown.\u2019  Note the application of the non-\nspecific label \u2018nervous breakdown\u2019 to his condition.  This resistance to the diagnosis of \nschizophrenia and the search for alternative interpretations of his behaviour and condition \nare also reflected in the following quotation where Amy explained that her son \u2018used to get \nhallucinations - this was when he was very ill - over his food like a plate of food\u2026and he \nhad very, very bright lights, but I think it was [due to being] over-worked.\u2019 \n \nContinuity of the person \nAmy suggested that her son was not a different person because of his condition, remarking \nthat \u2018he\u2019s always been different and he\u2019s always caused problems in the fact of tensions and \nevery time we went on holiday as a family\u2026it was ruined.\u2019  This may suggest that Amy did \nnot perceive her son\u2019s current self as significantly different from how he was throughout \nhis childhood and therefore no loss of a pre-morbid self was believed to have occurred.  \nInstead, in her account, there appeared to be some continuity in how she represented him.  \nThis was further illustrated when Amy explained that \u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed\u2026 he\u2019s \nalways been like that\u2026 a bit difficult, erm, I feel he\u2019s the same person.\u2019  \n \nCoping with the condition \nWhen asked how she coped with her son\u2019s illness, Amy explained that \u2018I think I haven\u2019t \ncoped too badly\u2026 somehow you get the inner resources to cope with things.\u2019  This \nsuggests that she believes she has gained an inner strength to cope without help from \nothers.  This was further illustrated when she reported that \u2018I don\u2019t like to distress them [her \nother children]\u2026because my daughter has got her own little children to bring up and \n 16\nJonathan [other son] has got a nice girlfriend.  I feel it\u2019s my, I\u2019ve got to deal with it - in a \nway it\u2019s my problem.  I\u2019m the mother.\u2019  It appears that Amy has isolated herself from the \nrest of her family in terms of coping with her son, as she perceives it to be her problem. As \nwell as indicating the standard positioning of mothers as being primarily responsible for the \ncare of their children, this could also be seen as reflecting some degree of self-blame, a \nreaction perhaps evoked by the routine blaming of mothers for the occurrence of any \nproblems with their children (Caplan, 1985).   \n \nAspirations for the future \nAmy explained that she felt unsupported by her son\u2019s social worker as illustrated by the \nfollowing quotation: \u2018Well if I could talk to somebody who\u2019d listen you know, like the \nsocial worker - she doesn\u2019t really listen.\u2019  She went on to explain that she wanted them to \n\u2018support me in the move that I think, and my son thinks, that he is well enough to get some \npaid, interesting work, give it a go but they won\u2019t.  They either say it\u2019s too early - they have \nbeen saying that now for years. I mean it\u2019s 12 years since he left Cambridge... he can\u2019t be a \nsolicitor without this year course [one year law course].\u2019  It would seem from these \nquotations that the support Amy feels she needs is help in getting her son to fulfil his pre-\nmorbid potential.  This could be interpreted in one sense as Amy seeing her son\u2019s possible \nstage of remission as a full recovery from his illness and seeing the social worker as \nrepressing her future part-images of her son (Terkelsen, 1987).  It may also show how Amy \ncontinues to invest her hopes in her son\u2019s earlier life script instead of considering that these \ninvestments may be lost and that hopes may need to be reconceptualised.  It is suggested \nthat this a common feature of loss among parents within Western cultures (Braun & Berg, \n1994) and can be seen as impeding the overall acknowledgement of loss, which is the first \nstage of Worden\u2019s (1991) model.      \n 17\n \nCase Study Three: Graham  \nGraham is 76 years old and lives with his 40-year-old daughter, Rachel.  She has been \ndisplaying symptoms of schizophrenia for 20 years and was diagnosed with schizophrenia \nfive years ago.  Graham has cared for Rachel since the onset of these symptoms as well as \ncaring for his late wife who also had schizophrenia. \n \nQualified interpretation of the illness in terms of loss \nAt first, Graham explained that he did not perceive the illness-related changes in his \ndaughter as a \u2018loss\u2019: \u2018No I don\u2019t see it as losing a daughter really\u2026 no I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve lost \nher.\u2019  Further evidence of this came later in the interview when he stated with insistence \nthat \u2018If she was suddenly taken ill [or] she was taken away I might feel I\u2019ve lost a daughter \nof course but no, not at the moment, no, no, no.\u2019 It would seem, however, that although \nhere Graham states that he does not conceptualise his response to his daughter\u2019s condition \nin terms of loss, the following quotation could be interpreted as acknowledging a \u2018psychic \nloss\u2019 (Miller, 1996): \u2018She\u2019s only physically the same\u2026you know, yes, she\u2019s a daughter \nalright, she\u2019s in a bad mental state but so, I mean I\u2019ve lost a daughter in the sense that she\u2019s \nnot really intelligent and doesn\u2019t say, doesn\u2019t converse really at all, so in that respect I lost \na daughter but she\u2019s there in presence.\u2019   In this extract, Graham points to the physical \ncontinuity in his daughter over time but contrasts this with the psychological and social \ndiscontinuity that has been occasioned by her condition. Remarks later in the interview \nonce again suggested that he experienced some sense of loss when he reminisced about \nhow his daughter used to be, saying that as \u2018a young child she was delightful and very \nbeautiful and [I was] very proud of her of course, so it is very sad that she has gone this \nway.\u2019  Although Graham felt he had lost the daughter he used to know, there seemed to be \n 18\nlittle expression of sadness but rather acceptance and a feeling of lacking control over the \nsituation as illustrated in the following quotation: \u2018But there is nothing I can do about it.  \nOne has to accept these things.  Well, you know, depressing as they are\u2026 one must accept.  \nIf you don\u2019t you could make yourself ill.\u2019  This could be interpreted as a successful \nresolution of grief or as a conscious or unconscious attempt to ignore potentially \nthreatening thoughts or feelings - something that is defined as an extreme coping \nmechanism for loss, termed \u2018escape\u2019 (Bowlby, 1980; Glick et al., 1974; Lindemann, 1944; \nParkes, 1998). \n \nCoping with the illness  \nIt would appear that Graham\u2019s main method of coping with his daughter\u2019s illness revolved \naround distancing himself from it both mentally and physically.  This was illustrated when \nhe explained that \u2018for most of the time I\u2019ve been out at work.  I mean, I worked till I was 70 \nand then I took on a part time job\u2026I mean, to a certain extent out of sight and out of mind.  \nYou see, I was able to dismiss it and concentrate on my work\u2026I coped with it that way \notherwise if I\u2019d had to live with it all these years\u2026if  I\u2019d had to full time, you know, at \nhome - well, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d be in a terrible state.\u2019  This type of coping has been referred \nto as \u2018masculine grief\u2019 as such distancing from emotionally threatening situations has been \nfound to be a standard male response (Martin & Doka, 1996).  Graham went on to suggest \nthat \u2018It\u2019s only this last year, as I say, that I\u2019ve given up work that it\u2019s pressurised me more \nshall we say and concerned me more.\u2019  This quotation suggests that Graham has more \nrecently found coping with his daughter and her illness to be more difficult due to spending \nmore time with her.  This could been seen as a time when Graham can no longer avoid \nconfronting his thoughts and feelings about his daughter. \n \n 19\nSupport \nGraham rarely spoke of seeking support for himself apart from one point in the interview \nwhen he reported attending the NSF carers support group.  He explained that \u2018I thought it \nmight be helpful so, yes, I - well, I don\u2019t think I get a lot from it\u2026It was interesting to \nknow that someone had a relative that was - well, had similar problems to my daughter.  I \ndon\u2019t know that she [the other carer] said he [her son] had any destructive habits so from \nthat point of view I felt she was a little better off.\u2019  These comments could be interpreted as \nsuggesting that the most credible support for Graham would have been offered by someone \nwho was in a situation that was closely analogous to his own. Graham may see their \nexperiences as enabling them to truly understand and empathise with his situation.  On the \nother hand, his account could be interpreted as indicating a reluctance to be supported. \n \nCase Study Four: Linda  \nLinda is 69 years old and is widowed following the death of her husband 15 years ago.  She \nlives with her 29-year-old son, Liam, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia four years \nago.  He has displayed symptoms of schizophrenia for 15 years and has been cared for by \nLinda throughout his life. \n \nInterpreting the illness in terms of change and loss \nLinda reported feeling that she had lost her son through his illness, explaining it is \u2018like \nsomething in another world. You know, you think you\u2019re in another world because you \ncan\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening to you because one minute you love them and then you \nthink it\u2019s the devil himself got them.\u2019  This perhaps suggests that Linda interprets her son\u2019s \nillness in terms of it having occasioned a sudden and difficult-to-believe transformation in \nher son\u2019s self.   Later in the interview, however, she points to a continuity at some level, \n 20\nalthough at the same time implies change, saying \u2018as a kid, he\u2019s always been hard work for \nus - well, it wasn\u2019t same thing as what his schizophrenia is but he\u2019s always had them \n[behavioural problems].  There\u2019s no getting away from that - he\u2019s had that from when he \nwas a baby, you know.  When it\u2019s schizophrenia it\u2019s a totally different thing altogether.\u2019  \nHere continuity is highlighted in her son\u2019s behavioural problems but these are differentiated \nfrom schizophrenia. \n \nEmotional reactions \nThere were few occasions during the interview when Linda expressed any emotions about \nthe changes in her son and the \u2018loss\u2019 of her son to schizophrenia.  On one occasion she \nexplained that it is \u2018very sad, very sad\u2019 to think of how her son used to be compared to how \nhe is now.  Later in the interview, whilst reminiscing, Linda stated that she felt \u2018very hurt \nabout it, not knowing what it was and I feel that I - I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m to blame for it like \nthat [social worker] said I was.  How can I be blamed for giving one of my children \nschizophrenia?\u2019.  This suggests that she is upset about her son\u2019s illness yet it is difficult to \ndetermine whether these emotions were compounded by Linda\u2019s interpretation of her \ninteractions with the social worker, when she seemed to feel that she was being held \nresponsible for her son\u2019s condition.  To the extent that Linda\u2019s recollection of her \ninteraction with the social worker is accurate, this may again be seen as highlighting the \nway in which mothers tend to be routinely blamed for causing dysfunction in their children \n(Caplan, 1985) (see Jean\u2019s case for an earlier example).  \nCoping with negative feelings \nLinda reported that she deals with her sadness by going \u2018for a walk, go out in the garden \nand lose yourself.  You know no one else will listen to you.\u2019  This seems to denote a \nreliance on oneself  rather than on others perhaps because of experiences of not being \n 21\nheard.  She also explained that \u2018I think you hide them [feelings] a lot.  I think you keep \nthem in, to yourself, which makes it worse\u2026I mean you can admit to your family but you \ndon\u2019t want to go out to the world because people have got a different view about it \n[schizophrenia].\u2019  Here, Linda seems to be referring to having suppressed her emotions or \nhaving shared them only with a limited audience because of an awareness of the stigma \nattached to schizophrenia. Miller (1996) suggests that alongside the abstract nature of \n\u2018psychic loss\u2019, the stigma of the illness serves to inhibit open discussion of the loss and thus \ncauses protracted grief.  Linda concluded by remarking that \u2018You try to hide it all, you \nknow.  You think it\u2019ll go away but it\u2019s never going to go away.\u2019  It would seem from this \nthat Linda internalises her emotions in the hope that her painful feelings will disappear, yet \nshe acknowledges that this is not going to happen. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nLimitations of the study  \nThe self-selected sample for this study included those parents who were involved in carers\u2019 \ngroups of the NSF.  Therefore, the sample consists only of those parents who have sought \nthis type of support for themselves and does not include parents who are not aware of these \ngroups or to whom they are not readily available.  The sample may also exclude parents \nwho have either dealt with any issues surrounding the loss of their child to schizophrenia or \nequally, those who refuse the offer of support from carers\u2019 groups, opting to support \nthemselves or seek support from within the family.  It also does not include a same-sex \ndyad between parent and child.  Inclusion of such parents and dyads may have produced \ndifferent findings.  \n 22\n \nIt is acknowledged that the accounts offered by participants may not be isomorphic with the \nevents and experiences of which they speak. The reasons for this may include memory \ndistortions, recall biases and the impact of the context; for example, in one interview, the \nson who was being discussed was occasionally within earshot of the participant.  Despite \nthis, it should not be assumed that autobiographical memory and retrospective accounts are \nnecessarily inaccurate and unstable.  There is sufficient research evidence to suggest the \ncontrary and some writers have offered suggestions for improving accuracy, some of which \nwere employed in this study (Blane, 1996; Brewin et al., 1993; Neisser, 1994; Ross & \nConway, 1986; Rubin et al., 1986; Wagenaar, 1986). \n \nDue to the case study approach, the generalisability of this research remains limited.  What \nthis study does offer is an in-depth assessment of participants\u2019 responses and feelings to \nenable an exploration as to whether these can be conceptualised in terms of loss and grief.  \nSuch close attention to personal accounts is perhaps more important at this early stage of \nour understanding of parental responses, particularly in light of the specific changes in an \nadult child with schizophrenia that are experienced by parents.  This exploratory study is \ntherefore important to aid our understanding before extending research to a larger sample.  \n \nTheoretical implications \nThroughout the interviews, participants preferred to recount their child\u2019s behaviours and \nactions despite being asked direct questions regarding their own feelings.  This mind set, \nalluded to by Miller (1996), limited overt expression of their own emotions.  It is possible \nthat this has been brought about by a prolonged period of speaking for their son or daughter \nand attending to their child\u2019s needs whilst suppressing their own.  For three of the \n 23\nparticipants, an in-depth, individual exploration of their feelings may have been a unique \nexperience, quite different from what had been provided at NSF groups.  The other \nparticipant attended family therapy to deal with issues surrounding her son\u2019s illness.  This \nmay have served to influence her conceptualisation of her son\u2019s illness in terms of loss. \n \nWhen exploring the extent to which parents conceptualised their responses to their child \nwith schizophrenia in terms of loss and grief, it was clear that there were mixed messages.  \nWhilst two participants acknowledged a loss at least to some extent and conceptualised the \nchanges in their child in these terms, another felt that no loss had occurred, as she did not \nsee her son as being any different to how he was before the onset of his illness.  The other \nparticipant similarly did not conceptualise the changes in his daughter in terms of loss, due \nmainly to her continued physical presence, yet his further remarks could be interpreted as \nimplying an experience of loss to some extent.  The data therefore suggest that there was a \ndifference amongst participants concerning the extent to which responses to their adult \nchild with schizophrenia involved a sense of having lost the child they once knew.  Those \nwho did not conceptualise their experiences in terms of loss tended to express methods of \ncoping with the illness itself, whereas those who did acknowledge a loss spoke of coping \nwith this loss and with its associated emotions. \nIt is possible that there were factors which served to complicate participants \nconceptualising their experiences as a loss.  A delayed diagnosis, as reported by Jean, may \nhave done this as it led to her continuing to cling to aspirations for her son, the \nrelinquishment of which is a major part of the grieving process (Miller, 1996).  Another \nfactor, which could in one sense be seen as complicating the portrayal of experiences in \nterms of loss, is the lack of acceptance of the illness.  However, although acceptance of the \nillness is understood as a \u2018turning point\u2019 in accepting the child as he or she is (Yamashita & \n 24\nForsyth, 1998), it could be argued in light of critiques of diagnostic categories in mental \nhealth (Harper, 1994; Parker et al., 1995) that Amy\u2019s sceptical view of diagnosis should not \nnecessarily be deemed an \u2018unhealthy\u2019 response. \n \nAnother factor which may have served to cause differences in participants\u2019 \nconceptualisations of their experiences is their perception of their child\u2019s pre-morbid self.  \nLinda alluded to the contrast between pre-morbid behavioural problems and symptoms of \nschizophrenia in her son.  This perceived contrast may have served to aid her in \nrepresenting her experiences in terms of loss.  Amy, on the other hand, had always \nperceived her son as different to others, and so her perception of the impact of her son\u2019s \npsychotic symptoms on his former self may have been markedly reduced.  It could be \nhypothesised that this may have been a factor in her not conceptualising her experiences as \na loss.  It could be concluded from this that it is not the existence of \u2018abnormal\u2019 pre-morbid \nbehaviour that complicates representing experiences as loss but rather the parent\u2019s \nperception of the contrast.  \n \nAs acknowledged by other researchers (Miller, 1996; Parker, 1993; Solomon & Draine, \n1996) it was found that the continued presence of the child served to make the resolution of \ngrief problematic, as explained by Jean.  Such continued presence makes it difficult for \nparents to assimilate the loss, which is said to be an essential part of grief work (Marris, \n1986).  It would seem that this continued presence also played a role in Graham\u2019s initial \nunwillingness to see his experiences in terms of loss, as for him his daughter\u2019s presence \nmeant that in one way he felt that he had not lost her. \n \n 25\nIn identifying whether these responses can be accommodated within existing theories of \ngrief, attention should be firstly given to Miller\u2019s (1996) adaptation of Worden\u2019s (1991) \nstage approach to grief work.  In light of this study, it would seem that Miller\u2019s model \nprovides useful tasks to work through \u2018psychic loss\u2019.  It should be noted however that little \ncomment can be made on the latter tasks of this model (the phases that Miller actually \nadapted) from the data obtained as it would seem that there is little evidence to suggest that \nthe participants were at these stages.  Instead, evidence is presented suggesting that the \ninitial task of \u2018making the loss real\u2019 is possibly an important part of the process.  Due to the \nspecific nature of this loss the difficulty of proceeding past this stage should not be \nunderestimated, a point to which Miller perhaps paid insufficient attention.  Successful \ncompletion of this stage may bring a different prognosis of the resolution of grief and \npossibly the need for a different, less directive approach from the counselling psychologist.  \n \nRegarding the utility of applying Stroebe\u2019s (1998) model of grief to these issues within \ntherapy, the data suggest that problems may occur.  Without an acknowledgement of loss, it \ncould be argued that the parent remains in \u2018restoration-orientation\u2019 without movement to \nthe \u2018loss-orientation\u2019.  If it were deemed necessary to promote \u2018loss-orientation\u2019 (and \nwhether this is always necessary or desirable is open to question), a careful initial focus on \nconceptualising one\u2019s experiences in terms of loss would be required.  Following this, the \noscillation between the two would need to be carefully monitored throughout therapy.  \n \nThis study highlights variation in the ways in which parents conceptualise their experiences \nwith their schizophrenic child.  Other responses to having an adult child with schizophrenia \nwere also expressed.  These included the burden of their child\u2019s behaviour, coping with the \nillness and the type of preferred support.  Further research could extend this exploratory \n 26\nstudy by involving a larger sample to increase our understanding of whether responses can \nbe conceptualised in terms of loss and grief.  Furthermore, such qualitative data could be \nexamined against quantitative measures collected to assess the conceptualisation of grief.   \n \nImplications for the practice of counselling psychology \nIf this study has managed to access common parental experiences and conceptualisations to \nany extent, then counselling psychologists may have a vital role to play in providing a \nfacilitating environment for parents to explore their responses to their children with \nschizophrenia.  The initial stages of therapeutic interventions for such parents could \nrepresent opportunities for providing information about mental illness in a supportive \nenvironment.  Laford (1994) explained that \u2018when we see mental illness as loss we are at \nthe starting point of the conscious grieving process\u2019 (p.11).  If this is considered cathartic, \nthen it may be worth spending time exploring whether a conceptualisation in terms of loss \nis plausible and useful for parents.  Tentative challenges by the counselling psychologist \nconcerning how the child is perceived by the parent to be the same and how he or she is \nperceived as different may make the loss more conscious for the parent.  A premature \nprogression to deal with the process of grieving, before ensuring this vital stage is achieved, \nmay cause problems later in therapy. \nHowever, as not all parents in this study felt that they had experienced a loss, the cathartic \npossibilities of facilitating the construction of parents\u2019 feelings in terms of loss may be \nquestionable.  In some circumstances, counselling psychologists may not wish to facilitate \na construction of loss on the grounds that to do so would overwrite unproblematic parental \nsubjectivities and limit parents\u2019 conceptualisations of their experiences.  In these cases, \ncounselling psychologists could simply provide a facilitative environment in which parents \ncan express their own feelings and explore their concerns around their child\u2019s condition in \n 27\nan environment quite different from that which can be offered by health professionals \ninvolved in the care of their child. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nATKINSON, S.D.
