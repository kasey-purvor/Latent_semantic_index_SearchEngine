As the question of what drives language\nlearning behaviour has great pedagogical relevance, it is no wonder that\nstudies on the relationship of language attitude, motivation and L2 compe-\ntence are abundant (for a review see Do\u00a8rnyei, 2001). For a long time,\nmotivation researchers have sought to establish a model of language learning\nmotivation that is relevant and applicable to every situation and for every type\nof learner (e.g. Do\u00a8rnyei & Otto\u00b4, 1998; Gardner, 1985, 2001; Noels, 2001). In the\npast few years, however, a number of studies (e.g. Kormos & Csize\u00b4r, in press;\nLamb, 2004; Yashima, 2000) have pointed out that different motivational\ncharacteristics might be meaningful for students of various ages and in\n0143-4632\/08\/01 030-19 $20.00\/0 \u2013 2008 K. Csize\u00b4r & J. Kormos\nJ. OF MULTILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT Vol. 29, No. 1, 2008\n30\ndifferent geographical settings. It is not only geographical, instructional and\nage characteristics that will produce different models of language learning\nmotivation, but most likely the language being studied also influences the\nconstellation of motivational variables especially if intercultural contact is also\ntaken into consideration. In many settings, such as in most countries of the\nEuropean Union, students above the level of primary education study several\nforeign languages, one of which is usually English and the other one a\nregionally important foreign language. Students\u2019 attitude to different L2s and\ntheir motivational intensity to study these languages might, however, be\ndifferent depending on the ethnolinguistic vitality of the given language and\non the amount and quality of intercultural contact the students experience.\nInformation on the nature of motivation for different foreign languages\nstudied by the same population might provide both language teachers and\neducational policymakers with useful insights that can help increase the\nefficiency of teaching these languages.\nIn our study we investigated one of the largest groups of Hungarian language\nlearners: primary school students who studied the two most popular foreign\nlanguages in Hungary, English and German (Hala\u00b4sz & Lannert, 2004). In our\nquestionnaire survey conducted with children aged between 13 and 14, we were\ninterested in the differences of the motivation and intercultural contact\nmeasures as well as determinants of motivated behaviour between learners of\nEnglish and German. We also addressed the question how the intercultural\ncontact experiences and models of motivated behaviour of students of English\nand German differ depending on the level of motivational intensity. The com-\nparison of learners of English and German is expected to yield pedagogically\nrelevant results not only in Hungary but also for the Central European region\nwhere, despite its decreasing significance, German is still a regionally important\nlanguage (Clyne, 1998), and English is gaining an increasingly important role as\na lingua franca (James, 2000).\nIntercultural Contact and Second Language Motivation\nIntercultural contact is an important issue in second language acquisition\nfor several reasons. First of all, one of the main aims of learning second and\nforeign languages is to be able to communicate with members of other cultures\nwho do not speak one\u2019s mother tongue. In addition, interaction with speakers\nof other languages creates opportunities for developing L2 learners\u2019 language\ncompetence (see e.g. Swain\u2019s [1985] output hypothesis). The learners\u2019\nexperience of these encounters can influence both their disposition to the\ntarget language and their attitude to L2 speakers and the L2 culture.\nIntercultural contact can also be assumed to affect L2 learners\u2019 motivated\nbehaviour, that is, the energy and effort they are willing to put into L2\nlearning. Therefore, as Do\u00a8rnyei and Csize\u00b4r (2005: 2) pointed out, \u2018intercultural\ncontact is both a means and an end in L2 studies\u2019.\nContact first appeared in Cle\u00b4ment\u2019s (1980) model as a key constituent of\nmotivation. The hypothetical model was tested by Cle\u00b4ment and Kruidenier\n(1983), whose results proved that among Francophone learners of English in\nCanada frequent and pleasant contact experience led to an increased linguistic\nIntercultural Contact and Language Learning Motivation 31\nself-confidence, which, in turn, affected students\u2019 motivation in a positive way.\nThe effect of intercultural contact on self-confidence was supported in a\nnumber of further studies in a variety of contexts (Cle\u00b4ment et al., 1994; Labrie &\nCle\u00b4ment, 1986; Noels et al., 1996). Furthermore, Cle\u00b4ment et al. (2001) found that\nmore frequent positive contact not only led to more confident language use but\nalso affected the identification profiles of language learners and reduced the\nlevel of anxiety students experienced when using the language both outside\nand inside the language classroom.\nIn certain learning environments, however, direct contact with L2 speakers\nis minimal, yet the L2 community may still be well known to the learners\nthrough indirect contact with it, that is, through the learners\u2019 exposure to a\nrange of L2 cultural products and artefacts, such as films, videos, books,\nmagazines and music. In their investigation of various L2 learning orienta-\ntions, Cle\u00b4ment and Kruidenier (1983: 285) isolated a factor that tapped\nthe \u2018social\u0001cultural\u2019 dimension of L2 motivation, which covered \u2018an interest\nin the way of life and the artistic production of the target language group\u2019. The\npresence of this sociocultural dimension characterised groups living in a\nmulticultural milieu, whereas for the groups in monolingual settings, the\nfactor included other meanings such as general knowledge about the world\nand self. In a longitudinal Hungarian study Do\u00a8rnyei et al. (2006) found indirect\ncontact to be one of the main variables in their model describing motivated\nlearning behaviour, in which the relationship between self-confidence and\nattitudes toward L2 speakers\/community were mediated through cultural\ninterest.\nIn a study using a subsample of the database described in the present paper,\nwe investigated the effect of direct and indirect cross-cultural contact on the\nattitudes and motivated behaviour of 237 English-learning students who\nexperienced the highest amount of contact by means of structural equation\nmodelling (Csize\u00b4r & Kormos, submitted). Our model indicated that attitudes\nrelated to the benefits of meeting foreigners affected both integrativeness as\nwell as motivated behaviour. The results of our study also suggested that\nmilieu plays an important role in influencing the importance students attribute\nto contact with target language speakers. In our model direct contact was\nfound to play a minor role in language learning motivation; it was rather\nindirect contact and the use of foreign language media that emerged as\nimportant contact variables.\nBased on the research projects discussed above, as well as taking into\naccount Do\u00a8rnyei and Csize\u00b4r\u2019s (2005) study, we decided to operationalise the\nfollowing motivation-related variables: (1) integrativeness, as it proved to be a\nkey component in shaping primary school students\u2019 motivation to learn\nvarious foreign languages (Do\u00a8rnyei et al., 2006; Gardner, 2001); (2) instrumen-\ntality, that is pragmatic values associated with learning the language (Do\u00a8rnyei,\n2005); (3) students\u2019 milieu (Do\u00a8rnyei et al., 2006); and (4) linguistic self-\nconfidence (Cle\u00b4ment et al., 1994). The contact variables employed in this\nstudy were based on a previous Hungarian research project, which set out to\ninvestigate what types of intercultural contact situations students might\nexperience in Hungary (Kormos & Csize\u00b4r, 2007). Based on the results of\nthe interviews conducted in this study, we defined two major types of\n32 Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development\ninterpersonal contact: direct contact involving verbal interaction (either\nspoken or written) with native and non-native speakers of the target language\nand indirect contact involving encounters with members of the target\nlanguage group without verbal interaction, and encounters with L2 cultural\nartefacts through various media (TV, Internet, books, movies, magazines and\nnewspapers) (see Kormos & Csize\u00b4r, 2007, for further details). In addition, it\nemerged that the importance students attributed to contact opportunities also\nseemed to be a substantial part of their motivation (Csize\u00b4r & Kormos,\nsubmitted). In sum, in the present study we operationalised five contact\nvariables: direct spoken contact, direct written contact, indirect contact, media\nusage and the perceived importance of contact. The criterion variable of our\nstudy was one of the most important determinants of language learning\nsuccess: motivated behaviour, that is, how much effort learners invest into L2\nlearning, how persistent they see themselves as language learners and the\nenjoyment students derive from L2 learning (Do\u00a8rnyei, 2001).\nIn this paper we investigated a stratified random sample of the population\nof Hungarian primary school children in the last year of their study. The two-\nlanguage design of this study, that is, taking into account the learning of both\nEnglish and German, follows from the fact that primary school students in\nHungary learn these two foreign languages in almost equal proportion (Hala\u00b4sz\n& Lannert, 2004). English and German are also the two most commonly\nstudied foreign languages in the Central and Eastern European region\n(Eurostat, 2007). Our research questions were the following:\n(1) What are the differences in the motivational and intercultural contact\nmeasures between learners of English and German?\n(2) How do the determinants of motivated behaviour vary for students of\nEnglish and German?\n(3) How do the intercultural contact experiences of students of English and\nGerman differ depending on their level of motivational intensity?\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants of the survey were 1777 students of English and German,\nwith 58.2% studying English and 37.5% German; 4.4% of students studied both\nlanguages at the time of the data collection. Participants were all between the\nages of 13 and 14 and attended the final, eighth grade of the primary school\nsystem and studied within a homogenous curricular and organisational\nframework (i.e. the national primary school system). The sampling followed\na stratified approach, and we selected students evenly from each main region\nand type of settlement in Hungary.\nInstrument\nThe questionnaire was specifically designed for the purpose of this survey\nand consisted of 71 items. Apart from eight open-ended items at the end\nof the questionnaire inquiring about students\u2019 foreign language learning\nIntercultural Contact and Language Learning Motivation 33\nbackground, all items used a five-point rating scale. The items for this\nquestionnaire came from two sources. First, some questions were drawn from\nthe questionnaire used in the survey reported in Do\u00a8rnyei et al. (2006). Other\nquestions were designed based on the results of Kormos and Csize\u00b4r\u2019s (2007)\ninterview study, which investigated the contact experiences of the same age\ngroup using a qualitative approach. The first version of the questionnaire was\npiloted with three students from the target group using the think-aloud\ntechnique. The questionnaire was then revised and administered to 100\nstudents prior to the main study as a pilot. Based on the statistical analyses of\nthis pilot run, the questionnaire was finalised.\nThe main variable groups in the questionnaire were as follows, with the\ntotal number of items given in parenthesis:\nItems concerning the target languages (German and English):\n\u0002 Integrative motivation (3 items). Example: How much would you\nlike to become similar to the people who speak English?\n\u0002 Instrumental motivation (6 items). Example: How much do you\nthink knowing English would help your future career?\nItems concerning the direct and indirect aspect of cross-cultural contact:\n\u0002 Direct spoken contact (5 items). Example: How often do you speak\nEnglish in your neighbourhood?\n\u0002 Direct written contact (3 items). Example: How often do you write\nemails in English?\n\u0002 Indirect contact (4 items). Example: How often do you see English-\nspeaking people in your neighbourhood?\n\u0002 Media usage (5 items). Example: How much do you like the films\nmade in the USA?\nItems measuring other motivational variables:\n\u0002 Linguistic self-confidence (3 items). Example: I am sure I will be\nable to learn a foreign language well.\n\u0002 Language learning milieu (2 items). Example: People around me\ntend to think that it is a good thing to know foreign languages.\n\u0002 Perceived importance of contact (8 items). Example: I think it is\nuseful to talk to foreigners because I can get to know how they live.\n\u0002 Motivated learning behaviour (7 items). Example: I am willing to\nwork hard at learning English.\nProcedures\nThe questionnaires were filled in during class time, with a representative of\nthe university always present to provide the introduction and oversee the\nprocedure. Answering the questions took the students approximately 20\nminutes on average.\nAll the questionnaires were computer-coded and the Statistical Package for\nSocial Sciences (SPSS) 13.0 was used for analysing the data. The answers to the\n34 Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development\nquestionnaires were first submitted to factor analysis and multidimensional\nscaling. Next descriptive statistics were computed for investigating the\nsignificant differences between various learners\u2019 groups. For this purpose\nthe MANOVA procedure and t-tests were used. In order to differentiate\nbetween students with higher and lower levels of motivation, cluster analysis\nwas employed. First, hierarchical clustering was carried out on a smaller sub-\nsample of the students \u0001 in our case a 5% random subsample was selected\nfor this purpose. Based on this first step, the number of clusters and their\npositions (i.e. the initial cluster centres) were defined and subsequently non-\nhierarchical clustering was run on the whole sample by inputting the cluster\ncentres received previously. The procedure of non-hierarchical clustering was\niterated until stable cluster centres were received. We also used regression\nanalysis to investigate to what extent specific variables contribute to the\nvariance in the dependent variable of motivated behaviour.\nResults and Discussion\nThe comparative analysis of the motivational and contact scales\nIn order to identify broader dimensions underlying the attitudinal\/\nmotivational variables measured by the questionnaire, we submitted the\nitems to factor analysis (conducting separate analyses for both languages)\nusing the principle component method (see Appendix 1 for results). Based on\nthe results, we can conclude that students\u2019 motivational profile can be\ndescribed by a four-factor solution, which includes integrative motivation,\ninstrumental motivation, linguistic self-confidence and milieu as latent\ndimensions. As for intercultural contact, five dimensions could be identified:\ndirect spoken and written contact, indirect contact, foreign media usage and\nthe perceived importance of contact. Items concerning the different aspects of\nstudents\u2019 learning behaviour formed one dimension, which has been named\nmotivated learning behaviour and served as the criterion measure of the study.\nNext, the results of the factor analysis were transformed into multi-item scales,\nand the Cronbach Alpha internal consistency reliability coefficients were\ncomputed (Table 1). The mean reliability coefficient of the scales was 0.71,\nwhich was acceptable for such short scales. The scale of perceived importance\nof contact had the lowest reliability figure, which is probably due to the fact\nthat this scale included items asking students to judge a variety of influences\nof contact on their learning process.\nThe MANOVA procedure showed that both instrumental (F (2, 1730)\u0002\n128.01 pB0.001) and integrative motivation (F (2, 1730)\u0002128.01\u0002113.10 pB\n0.001) regarding the two languages varied significantly as an effect of which\nlanguage the students studied. Moreover, the repeated measures ANOVA\nprocedure conducted separately for learners of English and German revealed\nthat both students of English (F (1, 1076)\u00021468.11 pB0.001) and learners of\nGerman (F (1, 674)\u0002986.14 pB0.001) display higher levels of instrumental\nthan integrative motivation towards the language they study. In terms of\nthe language-related scales, it is not surprising that learners of the given\nlanguage score higher on both scales than students who do not learn the\nIntercultural Contact and Language Learning Motivation 35\nforeign language. It has been documented in earlier Hungarian studies\n(Do\u00a8rnyei et al., 2006) that the mere fact that students are engaged in the study\nof an L2 enhances their attitudes towards that particular language. In this\nrespect, our study confirms that the instruction of a given foreign language has\na positive effect on students\u2019 motivational orientation. The fact that the scale\nmeasuring instrumental motivation received higher endorsement from stu-\ndents than integrative motivation indicates that Hungarian students even at a\nrelatively young age are well aware of the possible pragmatic benefits the\nknowledge of a foreign language might offer in the European context. The\nresults also show that in comparison with averages on the same scale in a\nsimilar population in 1999 and 2004 (Do\u00a8rnyei et al., 2006), there is a decrease in\nthe relevance of the construct of integrativeness for young foreign language\nlearner generations in Hungary (for proposals concerning new conceptualisa-\ntions of integrativeness see Do\u00a8rnyei [2005]).\nIf we compare attitude scales for German and English, we can see that\nlearners of German scored higher on the English-related scales than on the\nTable 1 Cronbach alpha internal reliability coefficients and descriptive information\nabout the scales comparing the students of English and German\nCr. aa Learners of\nEnglish\n(n\u00011025)\nLearners of\nGerman\n(n\u0001660)\nMean sd Mean sd\nMotivational scales\nIntegrative motivation: English 0.76 3.50 0.91 3.31 0.90\nIntegrative motivation: German 0.79 2.56 0.93 3.12 0.88\nInstrumental motivation: English 0.71 4.39 0.54 4.23 0.62\nInstrumental motivation: German 0.79 3.56 0.81 3.98 0.59\nMilieu 0.63 4.36 0.70 4.28 0.73\nSelf-confidence 0.64 3.22 0.81 3.06 0.70\nContact scales\nDirect spoken contact 0.77 1.95 0.79 1.92 0.72\nDirect written contact 0.72 1.65 0.86 1.45 0.69\nIndirect contact 0.63 2.84 0.79 2.76 0.82\nForeign media usage 0.69 2.47 0.80 2.26 0.72\nPerceived importance of contact 0.53 3.24 0.86 3.15 0.87\nCriterion measure\nMotivated learning behaviour 0.74 3.08 0.97 2.90 0.96\naCr. a, Cronbach Alpha internal consistency reliability coefficient.\n36 Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development\nscales measuring the language they are learning, that is, German. In other\nwords, despite the fact that students studied German, they had more positive\nattitudes towards English than to German, whereas learners of English scored\nconsiderably lower on German-related scales than on English-related ones.\nThe positive attitudes towards English as a global language at the expense of\nGerman, a regionally highly important language in Hungary, reinforce our\nprevious results about the leading role of English in Hungary (Do\u00a8rnyei et al.,\n2006). These results are also reflected in students\u2019 scores concerning the\nenvironmental support they receive (milieu) (t\u00022.36 pB0.05), linguistic self-\nconfidence (t\u00023.97 pB0.001) and motivated learning behaviour (t\u00023.61 pB\n0.001). Learners of English were found to be willing to put more effort into\nlanguage learning, more self-confident about their use of the foreign language\nand receive more encouragement from their environment.\nConcerning the contact variables of the study, the MANOVA procedure\nindicated that the frequency of different types of contact situations varied\nsignificantly as an effect of which language the students studied (F (8, 3510)\u0002\n4.16 pB0.001). The post-hoc t-tests, the significance level of which was\nadjusted for multiple testing, revealed that both learners of English and\nGerman scored significantly higher on the perceived importance of contact\nscale than on any other contact-related scales. The results of the scales\nmeasuring different types of indirect contact all showed mean values lower\nthan the mid-point of the scale, which expressed medium-level frequency.\nStudents rarely experienced direct contact, as the mean values of both direct\nspoken and written contact were lower than 2, which indicated low frequency.\nMoreover, the descriptive statistics suggested that usage of the Internet and\nother media-related indirect contact experiences were not frequent for this age\ngroup either. Our results revealed, if assessed on a national level, that neither\ntourism, nor family and school resources provided enough opportunities for\nprimary school students to experience frequent intercultural contact.\nAs regards differences between students of English and German in terms of\nintercultural contact, out of the five scales, two showed significantly different\nresults for the two groups of learners: students of English had a higher level of\ndirect written contact (t\u00024.99 pB0.001) and media contact (t\u00025.43 pB0.001)\nthan participants who studied German. Our findings indicated that the\nlanguage of international written (and primarily electronic) communication\nfor Hungarian learners was English rather than German. Learners of English\nwere also found to have more frequent contact with the Internet, books, films\nand magazines in English than students who studied German. This is\nunderstandable as most of the web pages on the Internet are in English, and\nfilms are available in Hungary with English subtitles, and rarely with German\nones. It seems that despite the fact that German is a regionally important\nforeign language in Hungary and a large number of German tourists still visit\nthe country (Do\u00a8rnyei & Csize\u00b4r, 2005), students perceive English as more\nimportant than German in their lives.\nIn sum, English is the language which almost exclusively serves as a lingua\nfranca in our context. Due to its status as an international language and its high\nlevel of ethnolinguistic vitality, students display more positive attitudes towards\nit and are willing to study it harder than the other foreign language, German.\nIntercultural Contact and Language Learning Motivation 37\nDifferences in intercultural contact experiences among groups with\nvarious levels of motivation\nIn order to investigate the contact-related differences among students with\ndifferent motivational intensity, we submitted the motivational scales (inte-\ngrativeness, instrumentality, self-confidence and milieu) to cluster analysis.\nThe choice of cluster analysis was motivated by the fact that this procedure\ncould form learner groups based on their scores of several variables that were\nrelevant in differentiating students with different levels of motivation. As a\nresult of the cluster analysis, we were able to define three distinct groups of\nlearners for both English and German. The first group contained students with\nthe lowest level of motivation, self-confidence and environmental support.\nStudents with a medium level of motivation were put into Group 2, whereas\nthose students who were highly motivated and received a higher than average\nenvironmental support formed Group 3 (for the results of cluster analysis see\nAppendix 2). Table 2 summarises how learners of English and German of\ndifferent motivational level perceive the usefulness of intercultural contact and\nto what extent they experience direct and indirect contact.\nThe results revealed that students who were the most motivated experience\nvarious types of intercultural contact situations more often than students with\nless commitment to foreign language learning. As this type of analysis of\nvariance did not indicate the direction of a relationship, this consistent pattern\ncould be explained in two ways. The scores of motivated learners of a\nlanguage were higher than those of less motivated learners either because their\ncontact experiences resulted in an increase of their level of motivation, or\nbecause they were highly motivated they had chosen to be involved in various\ncontact situations; in which case the observed attitudinal\/motivational\ndifferences are a function of contact and not a result of it. Previous theoretical\n(Do\u00a8rnyei & Csize\u00b4r, 2005; Pettigrew, 1998) and empirical work (Csize\u00b4r &\nKormos, submitted; Kormos & Csize\u00b4r, 2007) suggests that contact experiences\nresult in attitudinal change, that is, more contact indeed leads to students\u2019\nincreased motivation, but one might also hypothesise that positive attitudinal\nand motivational dispositions towards the language might also feed into\nstudents\u2019 desire to seek out more intercultural contact opportunities.\nThe relationship between the motivational and contact scales and the\ncriterion measure\nIn our study we were also interested in what motivational and contact\nvariables predict one of the most important determinants of language learning\nsuccess: motivated learning behaviour for students of English and German. In\norder to answer this question, we submitted our data to regression analysis.\nFirst, learners of English and German were analysed separately, and then\nfurther inquiry was made into two groups of learners of English and German:\nstudents with the highest and medium level of motivation. Non-motivated\nstudents were excluded from this part of the analysis because their scores on\nmotivated learning behaviour were low, and this would threaten the validity\nof the analysis.\n38 Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development\nTable 2 Analysis of variance: Contact scales (5-point) in each cluster group: English and\nGerman\nPerceived\nimportance\nof contact\nDirect\nspoken\ncontact\nDirect\nwritten\ncontact\nIndirect\ncontact\nForeign\nmedia\ncontact\nEnglish\nStudents with the\nlowest level of\nmotivation (n\u0002219)\n2.64 1.56 1.40 2.39 2.05\nStudents with a medium\nlevel of motivation\n(n\u0002466)\n3.28 1.82 1.48 2.78 2.34\nStudents with the\nhighest level of\nmotivation (n\u0002340)\n3.57 2.39 2.05 3.20 2.90\nF 93.06 102.85 61.66 84.28 101.56\np 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001\nPost-hoc comparisona:\nScheffe\n1 1 1, 2 1 1\n2 2 3 2 2\n3 3 3 3\nGerman\nStudents with the lowest\nlevel of motivation\n(n\u0002120)\n2.60 1.63 1.44 2.43 1.98\nStudents with a medium\nlevel of motivation\n(n\u0002301)\n3.09 1.81 1.37 2.69 2.22\nStudents with the highest\nlevel of motivation\n(n\u0002239)\n3.50 2.19 1.56 3.02 2.46\nF 46.64 32.31 5.11 24.63 20.20\np 0.001 0.001 0.006 0.001 0.001\nPost-hoc comparisona:\nScheffe\n1 1 2, 1 1 1\n2 2 1, 3 2 2\n3 3 3 3\naNumbers refer to the groups.

Students\u2019 motivated learning behaviour was largely\naffected by students\u2019 linguistic self-confidence and their integrative motivation\n(see Table 3). These results partly confirm previous Hungarian studies (see\nDo\u00a8rnyei et al. [2006] on the importance of integrative motivation) but also\nindicate that personal attitudinal variables such as self-confidence play an\nimportant role in predicting motivated behaviour. Out of the five contact\nvariables, perceived importance of contact and foreign media usage con-\ntributed in a significant and substantial way to students\u2019 learning behaviour.\nThis underscores the fact that in a foreign language environment the role of\nindirect contact is more important than that of direct contact. More interest-\ningly, however, direct written contact was also entered into the equation,\nTable 3 Results of the regression analysis of the motivational and contact scales\nand motivated learning behaviour as the dependent variable for the learners of English\n(n\u00021025) and German (n\u0002660)\nVariables Final model\nB SE(B) b\nEnglish\nSelf-confidence 0.37 0.03 0.31***\nIntegrativeness 0.23 0.03 0.22***\nPerceived importance of contact 0.17 0.03 0.15***\nForeign media usage 0.15 0.03 0.12***\nMilieu 0.18 0.04 0.13***\nDirect written contact 0.10 0.04 0.06*\nR2 0.45\nF for change in R2 137.52***\nGerman\nIntegrativeness 0.26 0.04 0.24***\nSelf-confidence 0.36 0.05 0.26***\nPerceived importance of contact 0.23 0.04 0.21***\nForeign media usage 0.14 0.05 0.11***\nMilieu 0.17 0.04 0.13***\nDirect written contact 0.12 0.05 0.09**\nR2 0.43\nF for change in R2 82.73***\n*pB0.05, **pB0.01, ***pB0.001.\n40 Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development\nalthough corresponding results bordered on the level of significance. These\nfindings indicate that even though the overall frequency of contact is not high\nfor students in a foreign language environment, contact variables, especially\nindirect ones, play a significant role in predicting motivated behaviour.\nThe similarity of the models for the two languages seems to suggest that\nmodels of motivated behaviour do not vary substantially for English and\nGerman; therefore in one population in one particular setting the same\nvariables seem to be important in influencing students\u2019 effort invested in\nlanguage learning.\nIf we compare our results in the various motivational groups of the two\nlanguages, interesting differences emerge concerning the factors effecting\nstudents\u2019 motivated learning behaviour. In the case of English language\nlearners, the contact variable that differentiates the highly motivated students\nfrom participants with a lower level of motivation is foreign media usage and\nwritten direct contact (see Table 4). Foreign media usage is an important\nTable 4 Results of the regression analysis of the motivational and contact scales and\nmotivated learning behaviour as the dependent variable for the learners of English with\nthe highest level of motivation (n\u0002340) and a medium level of motivation (n\u0002466)\nVariable Final model\nB SE(B) b\nHighest level of motivation\nForeign media usage 0.17 05 0.18***\nSelf-confidence 0.48 08 0.32***\nMilieu 0.35 09 0.19***\nIntegrativeness 0.23 08 0.15***\nPerceived importance of contact 0.14 05 0.14***\nR2 0.24\nF for change in R2 20.75***\nMedium level of motivation\nSelf-confidence 0.38 0.06 0.28***\nPerceived importance of contact 0.16 0.05 0.16***\nIntegrativeness 0.27 0.07 0.19***\nMilieu 0.20 0.07 0.13**\nDirect written contact 0.15 0.05 0.13**\nR2 0.15\nF for change in R2 15.88***\n*pB0.05, **pB0.01, ***pB0.001.\nIntercultural Contact and Language Learning Motivation 41\npredictor variable of motivated learning behaviour for students with the\nhighest level of motivation, whereas direct written contact predicts the\nlearning behaviour of the participants with medium level of motivation.\nWe hypothesise that this is related to the different strategies of how students\ncommit themselves to various contact situations. Students with a higher level\nof motivation might be aware of the benefits of using various forms of media\nfor developing their language skills, and therefore might engage in reading,\nlistening to and watching foreign language cultural products. On the other\nhand, English language learners with lower levels of motivation might choose\na different form of contact and use written communication as a means of\ndeveloping their language skills. In the case of students of German, this\ndifference in the role of contact through the media and written contact does\nnot surface, probably due to the fact that German language cultural products\nare less easily and widely available for students (see Table 5). What\ndifferentiates the models of motivated behaviour for learners of German\nwith different levels of motivational intensity is the role of the students\u2019\nTable 5 Results of the regression analysis of the motivational and contact scales\nand motivated learning behaviour as the dependent variable for the learners of German\nwith the highest level of motivation (n\u0002238) and with a medium level of motivation\n(n\u0002301)\nVariable Final model\nB SE(B) b\nHighest level of motivation\nPerceived importance of contact 0.16 0.06 0.16**\nSelf-confidence 0.24 0.08 0.18**\nForeign media usage 0.17 0.06 0.16**\nIntegrativeness 0.28 0.10 0.16**\nMilieu 0.22 0.08 0.14*\nR2 0.19\nF for change in R2 10.58***\nMedium level of motivation\nSelf-confidence 0.35 0.07 0.26***\nPerceived importance of contact 0.20 0.06 0.19***\nForeign media usage 0.16 0.07 0.13*\nDirect written contact 0.16 0.08 0.12*\nR2 0.18\nF for change in R2 16.29***\n*pB0.05, **pB0.01, ***pB0.001.\n42 Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development\nmilieu. It seems likely that because the overall role of German in the world is\nperceived as less important by students, and consequently students\u2019 attitude\ntowards this language is not as positive as to English, parental support plays a\nhighly important role in sustaining children\u2019s motivated behaviour.\nConclusion\nIn this paper we reported the results of a nationwide representative survey\nconducted with Hungarian primary school children studying English and\nGerman, in which we investigated the differences in the motivational and\nintercultural contact measures as well as determinants of motivated behaviour\nbetween learners of English and German. Our results indicate that students of\nEnglish have a more positive attitude towards the native speakers of the\nlanguage they study than learners of German, and children who study English\nhave higher levels of linguistic self-confidence, invest more energy into\nlanguage learning, and receive more support from their environment than\nchildren who receive German instruction. Learners of English experience more\nfrequent direct written contact and contact through media products than\nstudents of German, but the participants in general only rarely engage in\ndirect intercultural encounters, and indirect contact is also infrequent. These\nresults suggest that English, being a language of international communication,\nInternet, pop music and electronic media, is more attractive for students in\nHungary than German, which is spoken in neighbouring countries and has\nbeen traditionally an important regional language but is perceived to have\nlower ethnolinguistic vitality. Although no other languages were involved\nin our research, it can be supposed that due to the specific role of English in\ntoday\u2019s globalised world, students of other regionally important foreign\nlanguages in Europe such as French, Italian and Spanish would also display\nsimilarly less positive attitudes and lower levels of motivational intensity than\nstudents of English. Our findings in this respect highlight the importance of\nethnolinguistic vitality and the global position of foreign languages in\ninfluencing the motivational characteristics of language learners even at a\nrelatively young age.\nIn our study we also addressed the question of how the intercultural contact\nexperiences and models of motivated behaviour of students of English and\nGerman differ. For both groups of language learners, the results indicate that\nstudents with high levels of motivational intensity engage in various types of\nintercultural contact more frequently than students who invest less energy into\nlanguage learning. As regards variations in models of motivated behaviour, it\nseems that it is motivational intensity rather than the language being studied\nthat affects what factors predict how much effort a given group of students is\nwilling to invest in language learning. For students of English with the highest\nlevel of motivation, the consumption of target language media products is an\nimportant contributing variable, whereas direct written contact was found to\ninfluence the motivated behaviour of learners with medium level of motiva-\ntion. For students of German, milieu was a predictor variable in the case\nof highly motivated students, which indicates that in order to compensate for\nthe less advantageous attitudes towards German, parental support is needed.\nIntercultural Contact and Language Learning Motivation 43\nOur research indicates that intercultural contact, even if not frequently\nexperienced, plays a far more important and complex role in language\nlearning than assumed in earlier studies of the field.\nSeveral issues emerged from our study, which are worth further\ninvestigation. As previous Hungarian results pointed to the significant role\nof schools in organising contact opportunities for students, school-related\nvariables should be considered in explaining students\u2019 level of intercultural\ncontact. Second, as at this point it is not clear how voluntarily students might\nengage in the contact situations, further research should be targeted at\ncomparing students\u2019 willingness to communicate (MacIntyre et al., 1998) to\ntheir actual contact-related variables, moreover a \u2018willingness to engage in\ndirect and indirect contact\u2019 measure might also contribute to our under-\nstanding of how students\u2019 learning behaviour is shaped by the motivational\nand contact variables.\nAcknowledgement\nThe research presented in this paper was funded by the Hungarian\nAcademy of Sciences (OTKA TO47111).\nCorrespondence\nAny correspondence should be directed to Professor Judit Kormos,\nDepartment of English Applied Linguistics, Eo\u00a8tvo\u00a8s Lora\u00b4nd University, 5\nRa\u00b4ko\u00b4czi u\u00b4t, Budapest 1088, Hungary (kormos.j@chello.hu).\nReferences\nCle\u00b4ment, R.
