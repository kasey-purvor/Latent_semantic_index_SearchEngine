An Analysis of how Flexible Working Practices\nInfluence Employees\u2019 Perceptions of Job Quality\nIntroduction\nThis paper is concerned with examining the impact of flexible working practices on\nemployee perceptions of job quality. In recent years many employers in the UK have\nintroduced a range of flexible working options for employees. The Workplace\nEmployment Relations Surveys 2004 (WERS) found a significant proportion of\nemployers (more than 70 per cent) offered some form of flexible working\narrangements to employees and that this had increased markedly since the WERS\n1998 survey (Kersley et al, 2005). This trend has been fuelled by growing concern\nover work-life balance (Bailyn et al, 2001), the desire to be seen as an \u2018employer of\nchoice\u2019 (Rau and Hyland, 2002) and in the case of the UK, legislative support for\nparents of young, or disabled children to be able to work more flexibly. At the same\ntime there has also been growing concern at the European Union (EU) level about\nquality of jobs. The generation of not only more, but better quality jobs has been\nidentified as a major objective of the EU\u2019s employment strategy, as defined at the\nLisbon summit in 2000. High quality jobs are seen as crucial to social inclusion and\nto strengthening a competitive economy and as such have been identified by the EU\nas a key future priority (European Commission, 2001). It could be argued that the\nintroduction of flexible working practices is likely to contribute to job quality, since\nthey offer employees some degree of choice over where and when they do their work,\nnormally designed to assist them achieve a better work-life balance. This paper\nexplores the relationship between flexible working practices and job quality in the UK\nin more depth.\n3Traditionally, flexibility has been seen as a characteristic of poor quality jobs (see for\nexample De Witte, 1999; Nolan et al, 2000; Purcell et al, 1999), where employers\nhave sought to achieve organisational flexibility by means of using \u2018non-standard\u2019\nworking practices, such as part-time work and temporary employment. Central to this\nview is the assumption that employees would prefer permanent and\/or full-time jobs\nwere they available. Much of this evidence, however, relates to so called flexibility of\nrather than flexibility for employees (Alis et al, 2006). Flexibility for, or employee-\nfriendly flexibility, alternatively provides employees with choice over the way in\nwhich they do their jobs. Hence, such flexible working practices would be expected\nto impact positively on an employee\u2019s perception of their job. However, few studies\nhave explicitly examined the link between the two. The more general evidence on the\noutcomes of flexible working for employees is mixed, suggesting that whilst there are\npositive outcomes, there are also some costs for employees (Cohen and Single, 2001;\nCooper and Kurland, 2002; Lee et al, 2002; Romaine, 2002). Therefore in practice\nthe relationship may not be so straightforward. The costs for employees associated\nwith working flexibly may ameliorate the impact of choice and the opportunity to\nachieve a more satisfactory work-life balance.\nBackground\nJob quality has been central to the EU\u2019s employment strategy in recent years and\nconsequently has received much attention in policy and academic debates (see for\nexample, Clark, 2005; European Commission 2001, 2002; Handel, 2005; Rubery and\nGrimshaw, 2001). However, despite this, a consensus on what constitutes job quality\nhas not fully emerged. The European Commission (2001) has identified ten\n4dimensions of job quality, including both objective and subjective elements. These\ncover intrinsic job quality; skills, life-long learning and career development; gender\nequality; health and safety at work; inclusion and access to the labour market; work\norganisation and work-life balance; flexibility and security; social dialogue and\nworker involvement; diversity and non-discrimination; and overall work performance.\nIn the academic literature authors have tended to deal with the concept of job quality\nin slightly different ways. Rubery and Grimshaw (2001) have grouped different\nfacets of job quality into three broad dimensions: those of employment relations and\nprotection; time and work autonomy; and skills and careers. Clark (2005) notes that\nthe analysis of job quality has typically focused on objective aspects such as financial\nrewards, hours of work and job security. However, he argues that the subjective\nexperience of workers is also important, and that other aspects such as job content,\nautonomy and relations at work should also be included. Handel (2005) also argues\nfor subjective measures to be taken into account and examined workers\u2019 perceptions\nof job quality along four dimensions; material rewards, intrinsic rewards (interest,\nautonomy), other working conditions (stress, workload, danger) and the quality of\nworkplace interpersonal relations.\nFlexible working has tended to be used as an umbrella-term to encompass a wide\nvariety of activities, including, for example, practices such as remote working (from\nhome, other company premises etc), reduced hours, different hours (either agreed,\nnon-standard hours, or discretion over working hours on a day-by-day basis) and\ncompressed working time where employees work their contractual hours over a fewer\nnumber of days than is normal (e.g. a 9 day fortnight). Whilst these practices\nrepresent different ways of working, the essential common theme here is the choice\n5offered to employees regarding the way in which they work. A number of other terms\nhave also been used to describe these different working patterns. Frank and Lowe\n(2003), for example, use the term \u2018alternative work arrangements\u2019 to describe\nworking patterns which offer temporal or spatial flexibility, including full time hours\nworked at times to suit the individual, compressed work weeks, and part-time and\nseasonal work. Fallon (1997) describes similar work patterns as \u2018alternative work\nschedules\u2019 and the phrase \u2018distributed work arrangements\u2019 has been used to describe\nworking in alternative locations (Belanger and Collins, 1998). Notwithstanding these\nissues of terminology, a number of researchers have attempted to examine the\noutcomes of various flexible working practices on employees. Although little explicit\nattention has been given to the relationship with job quality per se, studies have\nexamined outcomes relevant to some aspects of job quality, namely job satisfaction,\nstress and opportunities for learning and progression. These will be examined in turn.\nAt a general level it might be anticipated that access to flexible working arrangements\nwill have a positive impact on job satisfaction. Greater autonomy and control over\nthe completion of work have been found to have a positive effect on job satisfaction\n(Hyman and Summers, 2004; Igbaria and Guimaraes, 1999). In a meta-analysis\ncarried out by Baltes et al (1999), flexitime and compressed working were found\noverall to have a positive effect on job satisfaction. However, findings on the impact\nof remote working on job satisfaction have been more varied. The lack of social\ninteraction has been found in some studies to lead to feelings of isolation and to\nimpact negatively on job satisfaction (Igbaria and Guimaraes, 1999), whereas in\nothers, job satisfaction has been found to be higher for remote workers (Baruch,\n2000).\n6If flexible working offers choices to employees which help them achieve a more\nsatisfactory work-life balance, one might expect it to have the effect of reducing stress\nlevels. However, it may also be the case that flexible working creates feelings of\nstress and anxiety itself. For example, if an individual nominally works reduced\nhours, but ends up with the same workload as a full-timer, coping with this may be a\ncause of stress. Whilst stress in the workplace has been extensively studied, there is\nrelatively little empirical research which specifically links stress and flexible working.\nSome work suggests that job stress is lower amongst those who spend more time\nworking remotely (Raghuram and Wiesenfeld, 2004), but others report that remote\nworkers show more signs of mental ill health than office based workers (Mann and\nHoldsworth, 2003). Tietze and Musson (2005) found evidence of some remote\nworkers experiencing stress associated with the self organisation required of such\nwork, especially where being at home created new demands on them. Linked in part\nto stress, Baltes et al\u2019s (1999) meta-analysis showed that flexitime had a positive\neffect on absenteeism, whereas compressed working time had no effect.\nIn relation to opportunities for learning and progression, the evidence is less positive\nfor flexible workers. Cooper and Kurland (2002) found that remote workers had\nconcerns over the lack of development opportunities offered to them, including\ninformal learning and mentoring from colleagues. In terms of progression, Frank and\nLowe (2003) found that flexible workers were perceived to have lower long-term\ncareer potential, although in contrast, McCloskey and Igbaria (2003) found no direct\nor indirect effect on career prospects. A number of studies have identified the costs to\ncareer progression specifically for part-time workers (Need et al, 2005; Sigala, 2005).\n7Cohen and Single (2001) found that working reduced hours for professional staff\nmeant that they were less able to spend time on skill development and bringing in new\nbusiness - factors deemed important for career success. Similarly Edwards and\nRobinson (2004) found that nurses who worked reduced hours had reduced\nresponsibility and fewer opportunities to learn new skills. In an earlier study,\nEdwards and Robinson (1999) also found evidence of part-time police officers being\nunder-utilised and at risk of skill erosion.\nThus, in spite of an accumulating body of research, the evidence on employees\u2019\nexperiences of flexible working and how it impacts on various aspects of their\nconception of their jobs is inconclusive and somewhat ambiguous (Igbaria and\nGuimaraes, 1999). This may, at least in part, be due to the problems of definition in\nthis field referred to earlier (Baruch, 2001). Whilst flexible working practices all\ninvolve some degree of choice, it seems likely that the way in which they might\nimpact on the subjective aspects of job quality would differ. Furthermore, McCloskey\nand Igbaria (1998) note the rather mixed samples which have been used in some\nstudies, (some have included part and full-time employees, clerical and professional\nworkers together and sometimes self-employed workers have been included) and\nsuggest that this places limitations on any conclusions which can be drawn and the\nextent to which the findings can be generalised.\nFaced with this lack of clarity from existing evidence and few attempts to draw\ntogether the findings relating to different aspects of job quality, this paper attempts to\nshed some further light on the relationship between flexible working practices and\nemployee perceptions of job quality. Our concern here is to focus on a range of\n8outcomes of flexible working closely related to dimensions of job quality. First, and\nmost obviously, autonomy is central to the notion of flexibility and has been identified\nby several authors as an aspect of job quality (Clark, 2005; Rubery and Grimshaw,\n2001). Autonomy includes the ability to control one\u2019s own time and location in a way\nthat meets individual needs and is closely aligned to the ability to achieve a\nsatisfactory work-balance. Second, flexible working practices have been shown,\nalbeit with mixed results, to have an impact on other dimensions of job quality such as\njob satisfaction, levels of stress and opportunities for learning and advancement.\nAdditionally, this article will examine the impact of flexible working on aspects such\nas workload and intensity.\nSince this study was concerned with subjective aspects of job quality, it was important\nto capture the lived experiences and perceptions of flexible workers themselves.\nSignificantly, this study also included, in addition to those who have formalised\narrangements for flexible working, employees who worked flexibly on an informal\nbasis. This was seen to be important, since as Healy (2004) observes, much flexibility\nis informal. However, by the very nature of their arrangements, those who work\nflexibly on an informal basis may be difficult to identify and have not been\nspecifically included in many other studies.\nMethods\nThe research reported here forms part of a wider study designed to examine the\nimplementation of flexible working practices across a number of organisations. A\ncase study approach was chosen in order to allow observations to be evaluated in\ncontext (Robson, 1995). The research is based on an in-depth case study of one\n9organisation, which had offered a range of flexible working practices to employees\nfor several years. This meant that employees\u2019 perceptions, based on their lived\nexperiences of flexible working over time, could be examined. Data were collected\nby two main methods: a series of semi-structured interviews and a staff survey. Some\ninternal company records and documentation were also accessed.\nNineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with a cross-section of flexible\nworkers. Interviews were carried out in the workplace during working time. The\ninterview questions were designed to gain an insight into individual experiences of\nworking flexibly and how it affected their perceptions of a number of aspects of their\njobs. Interviews were audio recorded with the permission of participants and\nsubsequently transcribed. The data were analysed using thematic content analysis and\ncategorisation techniques using the nVivo software package.\n10\nThe questionnaire was web-based and a hypertext link was sent via email to all UK\nbased staff. The questionnaire asked first, a range of questions about their working\narrangements, and biographical details. Second, it examined a range of attitudes or\nfeelings towards the organisation which have been linked to discretionary behaviour\nPurcell et al, 2003). Existing measures of job satisfaction (Schneider et al, 2003),\ncareer preference and career self-management (King, 2003), stress (Rose, 2005) and\norganisational commitment (Cook and Wall, 1980) were used. Finally, flexible\nworkers were asked specifically about the effect of their working pattern on their\nwork-life balance, stress levels, participation in teamwork and the quantity and quality\nof their work.\nFindings\nThis organisation is a software company and, at the time of the research, employed\nover 2000 staff in the UK. Flexible working options had been offered to employees\nfor several years. The primary motivation for introducing a formal policy and request\nprocedure for flexible working was to improve their competitive position in the labour\nmarket. There was also a view that as a software company they should be in the\nforefront of this type of working. In this organisation flexible working was presented\nas something that was available to all employees. It was not positioned as being\nprimarily a family friendly policy, aimed at parents with caring responsibilities. In\naddition to those with caring responsibilities, respondents in this study chose to work\nflexibly for a variety of other reasons, including reducing long commute times, to\naccommodate partners\u2019 working arrangements and, especially in the case of those\nworking compressed time, as a stress antidote allowing them to perform household\nand personal business at quieter times.\n11\nThree hundred and sixty five completed questionnaires were received, representing a\nresponse rate of 17.3 per cent. Sixty eight per cent of respondents were male and 32\nper cent female. The majority were married, or living with a partner (84 per cent) and\n47.2 per cent had caring responsibilities for dependants. Just under 90 per cent of the\nrespondents identified themselves as flexible workers. Since only just over 10 per\ncent of respondents did not work flexibly, we have not broken down the survey results\nby flexible and non-flexible workers; rather we report on the survey results for\nflexible workers (n=326).\nRemote working was by far the most common form of flexible working. In practice,\nremote working arrangements were largely informal (73.9 per cent), at the discretion\nof the individual (93 per cent) and irregular (68.2 per cent), typically being one day or\nless per week (65.1 per cent). Less than a third (30.7 per cent) reported working\nremotely according to a regular pattern. Flexitime was also common with two thirds\nof respondents reporting that they exercised discretion over their start and finish\ntimes. However, only just over 25 per cent worked staggered hours (agreed, non-\nstandard working times). Reduced hours working was not common in this\norganisation, with only 5 per cent reporting that they worked part-time. The low\nincidence of reduced hours probably reflects the thinking behind the introduction of\nflexible working in this organisation \u2013 which was partially driven by a desire to help\nemployees manage long working hours, rather than to tackle long hours per se.\nInterestingly, only 18 per cent of flexible workers who responded to the survey\nindicated that they had a formal arrangement to allow them to work flexibly. The vast\n12\nmajority (82 per cent) described their flexible working arrangement as informal. This\nhigh degree of informality associated with flexible working in this organisation may,\nat least partially, be related to the low incidence of reduced hours or part-time\nworking, since this is the only form of flexible working which clearly requires a new\ncontractual arrangement. However, as indicated above, this informality was reflected\nin the control over time and place of work exercised by remote workers and those\nwho worked flexi-time. The inclusion of those without formal arrangements is\nsignificant and is a distinguishing feature of this study.\nThe survey responses painted a picture of long working hours and long commute\ntimes. Eighty per cent of flexible workers indicated that they regularly worked more\nthan five hours over their contractual hours each week. Thirty per cent of workers\nindicated that they had a commute time of between thirty minutes and one hour, with\nanother 30 per cent having commute times of between one to two hours daily. Eighty\nfive per cent of flexible workers indicated that they were married or living with a\npartner, however only 50 per cent indicated that they had caring responsibilities for\ndependants. This result shows that in this organisation at least half of all flexible\nworkers had chosen to work like this for reasons other than caring responsibilities. (It\nis of course possible that those with caring responsibilities had chosen to work\nflexibly for other reasons too.)\nControl and Autonomy\nAt a general level we found that participants had responded positively to being able to\nwork flexibly and to the increased control it gave to them over their lives. One\nrespondent who worked remotely on two days a week commented, \u201cjust that\n13\nflexibility to be able to manage your life. I think it\u2019s a huge benefit\u201d. The ability to\ncontrol and manage their own work gave employees a general sense of empowerment,\n\u201c(Flexible working) probably gives people a sense that the company is\nlooking after them and hence hopefully a sense of a better well-being. A\nsense that they feel they do have a certain degree of empowerment about\nwhere they work and when they work, within business restrictions of\ncourse.\u201d (remote worker)\nMore specifically employees highly valued the opportunity to organise their day as\nthey chose. One remote worker explained,\n\u201cI think the flexibility is not so much home versus work in terms of\nlocation. I think it\u2019s the ability to, if you like, push stuff around and\nreorganise dynamically, because if you feel that you\u2019re in control of the\neight hours of that day and you can choose where and how you are going\nto use that time, then you just get a great feeling of really feeling in charge\nof your life, as opposed to having your life run by someone else and I\nthink that\u2019s vitally important.\u201d\nTaking this flexibility further, some respondents talked about managing their entire\nday in a different way when they worked flexibly, sometimes taking time out of the\nnormal working day to go, for example, to the gym or the supermarket and then\nresume work later in the evening.\n14\nBeing able to work flexibly, particularly remotely, meant that many respondents felt\nthey had more autonomy in the way in which they carried out their work. Being able\nto have time to think and reflect was seen to be important. One remote worker\ncommented,\n\u201cIt\u2019s that thinking time. I think that when you\u2019re sitting at your desk and\nyou\u2019re just kind of sitting there for maybe ten, fifteen minutes and you\u2019re\nvery conscious that your manager\u2019s sitting right next to you watching you,\n... because you don\u2019t want to be appearing like you\u2019re not doing your\nwork, but when you\u2019ve got that time at home just to kind of sit and think\nand \u2026look at everything that\u2019s going on, you can reflect a little bit.\u201d\nIn a more general sense, employees responded positively to being treated in a more\n\u2018adult\u2019 way by their employer, who allowed them to exercise some choice over when\nand where they conducted their work and judged them on their achievements and\noutputs, rather than the time spent in the workplace. As one respondent who worked\na compressed fortnight remarked,\n\u201cI think with (company name), they treat you as adults and trust you,\nbecause you have work to do and it\u2019s your responsibility to get it done.\nAnd if it suits you better to work later, or to do it in different hours, or \u2026\nto just come in late, but work late or do something then they know that as\nlong as you deliver on your work, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\n15\nOne person, working a reduced hours contract, also expressed appreciation of the\ngeneral attitude towards flexibility,\n\u201cI would hate to do a nine to five job and to be faced forever with the\nknowledge that as soon as you come in twenty minutes late someone\u2019s\ngoing to stick their head up and go \u2018Why are you late?\u2019\u201d\nJob satisfaction\nIn relation to job satisfaction both the interview and the questionnaire data painted a\npositive picture. Overall, flexible workers in this organisation reported high levels of\njob satisfaction. The questionnaire results showed that nearly 78 per cent of flexible\nworkers were satisfied or very satisfied with overall job satisfaction. Over 84 per cent\nwere satisfied or very satisfied with both job fulfilment and with their work group. In\naddition, approximately two thirds of flexible workers were satisfied or very satisfied\nwith empowerment, work facilitation, and security.\nFrom the interview data there was considerable evidence that employees found being\nable to work flexibly had impacted positively on their levels of job satisfaction. For\nsome of those working reduced hours, this working pattern enabled them to continue\nwith a job they enjoyed. One explained,\n\u201cI have not had to lose status, I have not had to take drastic cuts in the\nlevel of work that I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s still as challenging as it was before I\nwent on maternity leave. I still get involved in, you know, fairly serious,\nhigh level business discussions and decisions and I still find the work\n16\nchallenging and enjoying, so I still want to get out of bed in the morning\nand come to work.\u201d (job share)\nOthers reported that being able to work remotely enabled them to do their jobs more\neffectively, which contributed to their levels of satisfaction. One employee remarked,\n\u201cI think when I work from home, I really get the chance to kind of take a\nstep back and really look at my clients and look at the campaigns that are\nrunning, and just maybe take ten or fifteen minutes to kind of sit there and\nthink. ... I have actually managed to focus a little bit more on the actual\ncampaigns and say \u2018Why is that campaign not working? What is\nhappening?\u201d (remote worker)\nWhilst not directly related to job quality per se, our findings show positive results in\nrelation to organisation commitment. Employees valued highly the opportunity to\nwork flexibly and many reported that being able to work in such a way engendered\npositive feelings towards the company and considerations about future employment.\nStress\nThe evidence on how flexible working impacted on stress levels was more mixed. In\nthe main respondents viewed flexible working as a means of reducing stress. The\nsurvey results showed that 59 per cent of flexible workers indicated that working\nflexibly had had a positive effect on the level of stress they experienced at work.\nHowever 9 per cent indicated that it had a negative effect on the stress levels\nexperienced, with the remaining 32 per cent reporting no effect. In the interviews\n17\nsome explanation of how flexible working influenced stress levels was provided. A\nnumber of remote workers indicated that just being away from the day-to-day\ndemands of the office reduced stress, whilst others reported that not having to\ncommute relieved stress. For example,\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit of a pressure valve isn\u2019t it? Just if you take yourself out\nof the office environment, for me personally it just kind of allows me to\nremove myself from all of those different people, different stimuli and\ndifferent demands and so on. So it\u2019s just, it clears my head a bit I think.\u201d\n(remote worker)\nSome interviewees described informal compressed working arrangements whereby\nextra time worked over a period of a month resulted in a day off in lieu. They\nhighlighted the benefits of additional \u2018personal time\u2019 outside of weekends, or the\nchance to take a break after a particularly busy period in the office,\n\u201cMostly if I take a compressed day it\u2019s just to give me my own time ... So\nit\u2019s just like, have a late start in the day, just put my feet up and watch TV,\nso it\u2019s just my own time, or maybe co-ordinate it with a delivery or\nwhatever at home type thing.\u201d\nHowever, some respondents also indicated that flexible working could itself be a\nsource of stress. One manager suggested that the actual experience of working\nreduced hours could be stressful for employees,\n18\n\u201cI would hazard a guess that most part-timers walk away with the\nemotional flexibility, a feeling that I don't have to be online or in the\noffice on this day, but I don't think they ever escape the psychological\ncommitment of having a five day-a-week job.\u201d\nFurthermore the view was expressed that for remote workers to move some types of\nwork away from the office into the home environment was undesirable and a source\nof stress,\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to associate my back room with the stresses of work. \u2026 I\nnegotiate in my job so having to have a row with somebody in your home\n- the first time I did it was, I hung up and then I thought I don\u2019t want to\nhave people talking to me like that in my own house.\u201d\nWork-life balance\nGiven the choices they had made, it is perhaps not surprising that the vast majority of\nflexible workers indicated that being able to achieve a satisfactory work-life balance\nwas important to them. Ninety five per cent of flexible workers indicated that having\na sense of balance between work commitments and home life was important. In most\ncases (80.5 per cent), flexible working had had a positive impact on their work-life\nbalance. Many interviewees described their work-life balance in positive terms. For\nexample,\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a good, high level job. I\u2019ve got the time to spend with my\nchildren.\u201d (job share)\n19\n\u201cIt's a complete harmony that I get ... I just have complete flexibility and\nwhat flexibility brings for me is freedom.\u201d (remote worker)\nInterviewees described the ways in which working flexibly allowed them to balance\ntheir work and life commitments. As one employee who worked flexitime explained,\n\u201cThe majority of times I would have dinner with my kids at home. I can\nconstruct my day in such a way that I can be home, have dinner with the\nkids; they go to bed, I carry on working.\u201d\nIn practice though, it was acknowledged by some respondents that the boundaries\nbetween work and non-work time could become blurred and that they found\nthemselves logging on to their computers and checking emails late in the evening and\nat weekends. In response to questions about how flexible working had impacted on\nthe quantity of work they did, many respondents reported that by being able to work\nremotely they were able to achieve more by being more focused and less distracted,\neffectively amounting to a quantitative intensification of work (French et al, 1984).\nThose that had reduced their hours also talked about working more intensely during\nthe time that they were at work.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m probably a bit more focused about work in the office than I\nwas as a full timer \u2026 I probably take shorter lunch breaks, I probably\ndon\u2019t eat lunch in the canteen as much as I used to.\u201d (reduced hours\nworker)\n20\nOpportunities for advancement\nEvidence regarding the impact of flexible working on individual careers and\nopportunities for future advancement was rather less positive. The interviews\nrevealed that remote workers were conscious of the significance of visibility (to senior\nmanagers) when working towards a promotion. One remote worker remarked,\n\u201cIf you are on a kind of mission to sort of build your profile within the\nbusiness and connect with all the right people, it would be difficult if\nyou\u2019re out of the office for two days a week.\u201d\nAlmost by definition, flexible workers may be less visible in organisations than those\nwho work according to a traditional pattern. In recognition of this, 64 per cent of\nflexible workers reported that, at least to some extent, they push to be involved in\nhigh profile projects.\nHowever, not all interviewees shared this view. In contrast, a remote worker\ncommented,\n\u201cI don't know that it has any impact. I mean, I guess if I'm allowed to\nwork from home and have a bit of quiet time, I'll feel like I can do better\nquality work and I work in a more planned and controlled way and I'm\nmore in charge of my own destiny. It probably enables me to be more\neffective which, in itself, might lead to career progression.\u201d\n21\nFor those working less than full time hours, a less positive picture emerged. Job\nsharing allowed partners to divide a role in such a way that they could each use their\nstrengths and make the most of opportunities to develop skills and experience.\nHowever, such roles were still perceived to be full time, so a particular opportunity\ncould effectively be closed to an individual if there was no suitably skilled partner\navailable. A reduced hours worker reported,\n\u201c(The manager) said \u2018I\u2019m very happy to have you as a part timer, but I\nneed to work out what to do about the other half of the job\u2019 and until he\ncould find somebody else who he was equally happy with to do the other\nhalf of the job, because it was effectively a job share, then it wasn\u2019t\npossible.\u201d\nAmongst those who worked reduced hours there was also a view that they were\ndisadvantaged in the performance review process and that this in turn would be likely\nto impact on opportunities for advancement,\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder to achieve the things that are seen as being of particular merit\nwhen it comes to the review process. It\u2019s much harder, I feel, to achieve a\nhigh review grade because, effectively, your impact is being measured\nagainst the impact of people who are working full time and so it is far\nmore likely that their impact will be greater. That said, it\u2019s a very\nnebulous thing.\u201d (reduced hours)\n22\nEven though some flexible workers had progressed in their careers whilst working in\nthis way, the demands of more senior roles were perceived to be inhibitors to\nadvancement. For example,\n\u201cI think there are business requirements and business needs that cannot\nmove. I think that I would lose a level of flexibility moving onto (a more\nsenior position), which I don\u2019t choose to want to do at the moment, but\nhaving said all of that, I received a promotion last year ... so I don\u2019t\nbelieve that it necessarily impacts your career in that sense.\u201d\nThe evidence that emerged regarding training opportunities and informal learning was\nalso mixed. On a reduced hours contract, the emphasis on performance and delivery\nof results could lead to a lack of training opportunities, as there was simply no time\navailable for individuals to access them. On a more positive note, there was a sense\nthat the rotation of staff\u2019s \u2018remote days\u2019 ensured that people still benefited from the\ninformal learning that takes place through everyday conversations with colleagues.\nThe sense of belonging to a team and the associated camaraderie did not seem to be\nlost.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a good amount of people in the office to strike up a\nconversation, to get learning from and you know, interact better so there\nisn\u2019t a problem team wise because we\u2019re all covered and then we don\u2019t\nmiss really important team meetings. You\u2019re not missing anything\nbecause we have to be in on those certain days so you\u2019re always getting\ninformation for everyone.\u201d (remote worker)\n23\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nIn this study we attempted to examine the outcomes of flexible working on a number\nof dimensions job quality and as a result present a more holistic perspective on the\nrelationship, than those studies which have taken a narrower approach (Cohen and\nSingle, 2001; Cooper and Kurland, 2002; Mann and Holdsworth, 2003). The\napproach adopted was designed to gain an insight into the lived experiences of\nflexible workers, in order to understand how flexible working impacts on different\naspects job quality. Furthermore, given the prevalence of informal flexible working\n(Healy, 2004), the study did not confine itself to flexible workers who had a\nformalised arrangement. The intention was to allow a more conclusive picture to\nemerge, than the sometimes conflicting results of previous studies (Baruch, 2000;\nIgaria and Guimares, 1999; Mann and Holdsworth; Raghuram and Wiesenfield,\n2004;).\nIn summary, our results show, in general, that flexible working practices had a strong,\npositive impact on employees\u2019 perceptions of job quality. However, there were some\nvariations according to different dimensions of job quality. There was strong\nevidence that control and autonomy was enhanced by the opportunity to work\nflexibly. For remote workers, in particular, autonomy was very real in this case, with\nover 90 per cent reporting that it was at their own discretion. Along similar lines,\nflexible working was reported to have a positive effect on work-life balance by more\nthan 80% of flexible workers. Although our survey data did not allow us to compare\nthe levels of job satisfaction of flexible workers with non-flexible workers, the\ninterview data demonstrates that flexible working was seen to impact positively on\n24\njob satisfaction. The results for stress and opportunities for learning and advancement\nwere however rather more mixed. Whilst the majority reported that flexible working\nreduced stress, just under a third reported no effect and 9 per cent indicated that it had\na negative effect. The interview data shows that the positive effects brought about by\nflexible working can be ameliorated by the pressures generated by certain types of\nflexible working, in particular reduced hours. The one dimension of job quality\nwhere flexible working was largely seen to have had a detrimental effect was\nopportunities for learning and advancement. Flexible workers, almost by definition,\ntend to have lower visibility in an organisation and this, together with perceived\ndisadvantage in the performance review and development process, were seen as\nimpediments.\nIn comparison to previous work, our results show a generally stronger, more positive\nrelationship between flexible working and job quality. However, these results need to\nbe seen in context and may raise some of the issues discussed earlier in relation to the\nproblems of definition. In this case study flexibly working was characterised by a\nhigh degree of informality. Our respondents reported exercising considerable\npersonal discretion over their working patterns on an on-going basis. This ability to\nexercise choice may help explain the more positive picture presented here than in\nother studies. For example, being able to choose when and how frequently to work\nremotely represents a rather different set of circumstances from working remotely on\na permanent basis, or according to a set arrangement. It is noteworthy that in our\nstudy the less positive associations tended to stem from those who worked reduced\nhours and who consequently had changed contractual arrangements, which limited the\ndegree of discretion they could exercise, at least in relation to the number of hours\n25\nworked. In this organisation, employees who worked remotely were also well-\nsupported in terms of the technology that they were provided with (laptop computers,\nInternet access, mobile phones), which meant that the experience was in many ways\nnot so dissimilar to being at the workplace. Furthermore, it may be the case that\nemployees who work in an information technology environment may be more\ndisposed towards technology-enabled working.\nThe findings reported here are based on a single case study and as a result the ability\nto generalise from them may be limited. This case study represents a situation where\nthe most common form of flexible working was remote working and where\nemployees were able to excise considerable choice. It may be that studies of\norganisations, where different forms of flexible working are more prevalent, or where\nthere is less discretion open to employees, would yield different results.\nOur initial contention was that the element of choice offered to employees over where\nand when they worked would have a positive impact on their perceptions of the\nquality of their jobs. Taking the interview and survey results together, our findings\ngenerally support this contention. However, the positive association was not evident\non all of the dimensions of job quality we examined. Flexible working was seen as\nboth alleviating and generating stress and was generally seen to have a negative\nimpact on opportunities for learning and advancement. This would suggest that the\nrelationship between flexible working and job quality is a more complex one than\noriginally contended and that certain outcomes of flexible working may mitigate the\npositive impact of an enhanced degree of choice. The results of this study, along with\nothers (Edwards and Robinson, 1999, 2004; Frank and Lowe, 2003; Need et al, 2005),\n26\nsuggest that the costs to job quality are primarily associated with the longer term, in\nrelation opportunities for individual development. As such, this represents a\nchallenge for both policy makers concerned with promoting work-life balance and\npractitioners aiming to become \u2018employers of choice\u2019.\n27\nReferences\nAlis, D., Karsten, L. and Leopold, J.
