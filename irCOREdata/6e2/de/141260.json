Results from PMA-qPCR were compared with culture isolation and\ntraditional qPCR. Under the conditions used, sample treatment with 50 \u03bcM PMA\nfollowed by 5 min of light exposure were assumed optimal resulting in an average\nreduction of 4.45 log units of the qPCR signal from heat-killed cells. When\napplied to environmental samples (including water from cooling water towers,\nhospitals, spas, hot water systems in hotels, and tap water), different degrees\nof correlations between the three methods were obtained which might be explained\nby different matrix properties, but also varying degrees of non-culturable\ncells. It was furthermore shown that PMA displayed substantially lower\ncytotoxicity with Legionella than the alternative dye ethidium monoazide (EMA)\nwhen exposing live cells to the dye followed by plate counting.

Introduction\nLegionella pneumophila is one of the main causative agents of severe atypical \npneumonias, particularly among people with impaired immune systems. Present in soils \nand natural aquatic environments, Legionella can persist as free-living microorganisms, \nas part of biofilms, or as intracellular parasites of amoebae and ciliates (Brand and \nHacker, 1996; Steinert et al., 2002).  L. pneumophila has found an appropriate ecological \nniche in several man-made aquatic environments such as potable water systems, cooling \ntowers, evaporative condensers, and wastewater systems (Colbourne et al., 1988). \nLegionnaires\u2019 disease (LD) is caused mainly by inhalation of aerosols generated from soil \nor aquatic environments contaminated with Legionella (Pascual et al., 2001). Outbreaks \nof Legionellosis occur throughout the world affecting public health as well as various \nindustrial, tourist, and social activities (Sabria and Campins, 2003). For this reason, \nsurveillance systems have been implemented in many countries. These programs have \nreduced the risk to a tolerable minimum and for example reduced the frequency with \nwhich nosocomial L. pneumophila was isolated from hospital patients with pneumonia \nfrom 16.6% to 0.1% in a six-year period in Germany (Junge-Mathys and Mathys, 1994). \nThe assessment of L. pneumophila in water samples is typically performed by \nculture isolation on selective media (European Guidelines, 2005). However, all culture-\nbased methods applied to the analysis of Legionella require long incubation times due to \nthe slow growth rate of the bacterium and do not permit the detection of viable but non-\nculturable bacteria (VBNC) that may represent a public health hazard. Moreover, it is \ndifficult to isolate Legionella in samples containing high levels of other microorganisms. \n4 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nTo overcome these limitations, nucleic acid amplification techniques and mainly PCR \nmethodologies have been described as useful tools for the detection of Legionella ssp. \nand specifically for L. pneumophila in clinical and environmental samples (Miyamoto et \nal., 1997; Y\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2007). The main advantages of these PCR methodologies are high \nspecificity, sensitivity, rapidity, low limit of detection, and the possibility of quantifying \nthe microorganism using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The application of qPCR for direct \ndetection and quantification of Legionella in environmental and clinical samples is \nrapidly increasing (Bustin et al., 2009) with a large number of different protocols \navailable (Ballard et al., 2000; Hayden et al., 2001; Herpers et al., 2003; Rantakokko-\nJalava et al., 2001; Y\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2005).  Nevertheless, although the application of all these \nmethods has greatly improved the environmental and clinical diagnostics of Legionella, \ntwo major limitations are known, including the potential presence of PCR inhibitors that \ncan result in false-negative results, and the inability of PCR to differentiate between live \nand dead cells in case that DNA serves as a molecular target. Whereas the first drawback \ncan be relatively easily solved by including internal positive controls (IPCs) in the PCR \nreaction, the latter poses a severe challenge as DNA can persist for long periods after cell \ndeath (Josephson et al., 1993). This is particularly relevant when disinfection is \nperformed and killing efficiency is monitored directly after the disinfection procedure. \nThe time between cell death and DNA detection is normally far shorter than the time \nrequired for DNA degradation. The inability of live\/dead differentiation may lead to an \noverestimation of the actual sanitary risk, and is therefore a serious limitation for \nimplementing DNA-based diagnostics in routine applications.\n5 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nThe majority of current molecular methods for viability assessment propose the \nuse of mRNA and rRNA. However, the longer half-life of rRNA species and their \nvariable retention following a variety of bacterial stress treatments make rRNA a less \nsuitable indicator of viability than mRNA (Dreier at al., 2004). The most commonly used \namplification techniques for detecting mRNA are reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), \nnucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) (Kievits et al., 1991), and reverse \ntranscriptase-strand displacement amplification (RT-SDA) (Walker et al., 1992). \nNevertheless, working with mRNA is far from trivial. Problems associated with the use \nof mRNA are mostly related to the difficulty of quantification since the number of target \nmRNA molecules does not reflect the number of cells and greatly depends on the \nmetabolic activity of the cells. Additionally, some mRNA molecules are not transcribed \nin cells in the VBNC state (Yaron et al., 2002).\nA promising approach to overcome the lack of viability information in DNA-\nbased detection methods was described by Nogva et al. 2003 introducing the viability dye \nethidium monoazide (EMA). The combination of sample treatment with EMA with \nsubsequent qPCR analysis makes use of the speed and sensitivity of molecular detection \nwhile at the same time providing viability information. The elegant method is based on \nthe addition of EMA to the sample prior analysis. Samples are incubated for some \nminutes allowing the dye to penetrate membrane-compromised cells and to intercalate \ninto the DNA of these cells. Subsequent light exposure results in fragmentation of the \nsuch modified DNA (Soejima et al., 2007) which reduces the amplifiability of the DNA \ntemplate. Despite the effectiveness of EMA to reduce PCR signals from killed cells, a \ndisadvantage consists in the fact that the compound can also enter live cells with intact \n6 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nmembranes with species-dependent differences (Nocker et al., 2006). This phenomenon \nhas been described for various microorganisms including Anoxybacillus (Rueckert et al., \n2005), Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, \nMicrococcus luteus, and Mycobacterium avium (Flekna et al., 2007; Nocker and Camper, \n2006), Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis (Kobayashi et al., 2009). \nTherefore, propidium monoazide (PMA) combined with qPCR (PMA-qPCR) has been \nproposed as an alternative method (Nocker et al., 2006). The higher selectivity for live \ncells was hypothesized to be due to the higher charge of PMA (two positive charges) \ncompared to EMA (one positive charge) making it more difficult for PMA to penetrate \nintact cell membranes. The PMA concept has in the meantime been successfully applied \nto a wide range of bacteria including Acinetobacter sp., Aeromonas culicula, Aeromonas \nsalmonicida, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacteroidales, Burkholderia cepacia, Enterobacter  \naerogenes, Enterobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli (includ. Escherichia coli O157:H7), \nKlebsiella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium avium complex subsp. avium,  \nMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Nitrosomonas europea, Pseudomonmas \naeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus (Bae \nand Wuertz, 2009; Cawthorn and Witthuhn, 2008; Kralik et al., 2010; Luo et al.,  2010; \nNocker et al., 2007a, 2007b; Pan and Breidt, 2007; Rogers et al., 2008; Wahman et al., \n2009).  Additionally, PMA-qPCR has been successfully applied to the study of viable \nfungi in air and water (Vesper et al., 2008), Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts (Brescia et \nal., 2009), and recently also to enteric viruses (Parshionikar et al., 2010) and \nbacteriophage T4 (Fittipaldi et al., 2010).\n7 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nThe aim of this study was to optimize PMA treatment for selective qPCR \ndetection of of live L. pneumophila cells in regard to PMA concentrations and light \nexposure times and to apply these parameters to different environmental water samples \nknown for sporadical Legionella occurrence. The study furthermore addresses the \ncytotoxicity of PMA on live cells in comparison with EMA. \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1. Bacterial strains and cultivation\nLegionella pneumophila NCTC 11192 (National Collection of Type Cultures, \nColindale, London, UK) was grown on Buffered Charcoal \u2013 Yeast Extract (BCYE) \ncontaining 0.1% \u03b1-ketoglutarate, adjusted to pH 6.9 with KOH, and supplemented (per \nliter) with 0.4 g L-cysteine and 0.25 g ferric pyrophosphate, 3 g glycine, 1 mg \nvancomycin, 50,000 IU polymyxin B, and 80 mg cycloheximide (all values per liter). \nInoculated plates were incubated for 4-7 days at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere \ncontaining 5% carbon dioxide. \n2.2. Sample Preparation and Analysis\nLegionella cells were typically grown to the mid-exponential growth phase and \nharvested by centrifugation (10,000 xg for 5 min.). Cell pellets were resuspended in \npeptone water, followed by serial dilution in peptone water in steps of 10-fold. Samples \ncomprised volumes of 500 \u00b5L. To kill cells, aliquots were exposed to 72\u00b0C for 15 min \nusing a standard laboratory heat block (Thermostat plus, Eppendorf) and placed \n8 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nimmediately on ice.  The absence of culturable cells was verified by spreading 50 \u00b5L \nonto BCYE-\u03b1 plates followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C as described previously.\n2.2.1. Culture isolation\nTo determine cell concentrations, one mL of the diluted samples were filtered in \ntriplicate through cellulose membranes (0.45-\u00b5m pore size and 47-mm diameter). \nMembranes were placed aseptically onto the BCYE-\u03b1 plate and incubated as previously \ndescribed. The concentrations of microorganisms in the initial bacterial suspensions were \ncalculated from the plates containing between 10 and 100 colonies, and the weighted \naverages of log-transformed counts of three replicates (ISO 8199) were expressed in CFU \nmL-1.\n2.2.2. Defined mixtures of live and dead cells\nThe effectiveness of PMA treatment was further evaluated with mixtures \ncontaining different known numbers of live and heat-killed L. pneumophila cells. \nInitial culturable cell numbers were quantified by plate counting. Cell cultures were \nsubjected to serial dilution to obtain suspensions containing 2, 3, 4, and 6 logs of cells. \nFinally, defined mixtures containing 250 \u00b5L of different concentrations of viable cells \nand 250 \u00b5L of different concentrations of killed cells were prepared.\n9 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n2.3. Natural samples\nTo study the effect of different water matrices on the different quantification \nmethods, 125 different cooling tower water samples and 40 \u2018clean water\u2019 samples were \ncollected. Sources of \u2018clean water\u2019 comprised spas, hotels, hospitals, and tap water, 10 \nsamples were taken from different sites of each source. \nSampling and transport to the laboratory was performed following the ISO 11731 \nprotocol. In the laboratory, 1 L of sample was filtered through 0.4 \u00b5m pore-size \npolycarbonate membranes (Millipore, Molsheim, France). Membranes were subsequently \nplaced in 12 mL of sterile deionized water in a screw-cap tube, and retained cells were \nreleased by vortexing for 3 min. Finally, the obtained cellular suspensions were \nconcentrated to approximately 1.5 mL using Amicon Ultra-15 filters (Millipore, \nMolsheim, France). The resulting volume was divided in three identical fractions, the first \nfraction was spread onto a BCYE-\u03b1 agar plate and the second and third fraction were \nanalyzed by qPCR and PMA-qPCR, respectively.\n2.4. PMA treatment\nPMA (Biotium, Hayward, CA) was dissolved in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) \nto obtain a stock concentration of 20 mM and stored at -20\u00b0C in the dark. A total of 1.25 \n\u03bcL of PMA solution was added to 500 \u03bcL of sample in a 1.5-mL light-transparent \nmicrocentrifuge tube (final PMA concentration of 50 \u03bcM). After 5 min incubation in the \ndark with occasional mixing, samples were exposed to light for 2 or 5 min using a 500-W \nhalogen light source (Fenopl\u00e1stica, Barcelona, Spain). The sample tubes were \nsubsequently placed horizontally on ice (to avoid excessive heating during light exposure \n10 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nand to maximize light exposure) in a distance of approximately 20 cm from the light \nsource. Occasional shaking was also performed to guarantee homogeneous light \nexposure.\n2.5. Cytotoxic effect of PMA and EMA \nEMA (Molecular probes, Inc. Oregon)  was dissolved in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide \n(DMSO) to obtain a stock concentration of 20 mM and stored at -20\u00b0C in the dark. The \nfinal concentrations of 100 \u03bcM and 200 \u03bcM were tested with a suspension of 5-log of live \nL. pneumophila NCTC11192. Different aliquots were preconditioned at 4 different \ntemperatures (4, 22, 35, and 44\u00baC) for 2 h and were equilibrated at room temperature \nbefore addition of EMA or PMA. Samples were exposed to light as described in section \n2.4.  Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspeded in new medium to get rid of \nnon-incorporated dyes.  Non-treated cells served as controls. Finally, cells were serially \ndiluted and 100 \u00b5L of the dilutions were spread onto BCYE-\u03b1 plates and incubated as \npreviously described. \n 2.6. DNA isolation and PCR\nCell pellets from 500 \u00b5L of PMA-treated and non-treated samples were \nresuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 20% Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA.), \n11 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nfollowed by three freeze-thaw cycles (-75\u00b0C for 10 min and 80\u00b0C for 10 min) to lyse cells \nand to release their genomic DNA. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at \n10,000 \u00d7 g for 1 min. \nDNA was PCR-amplified in optical microplates using a total volume of 25 \u00b5L. \nReaction mixtures contained 1\u00d7 TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied \nBiosystems, Foster City, CA), 300 nM of each L. pneumophila-specific primers dotAF \nand dotAR (amplifying a 80-bp dotA fragment), and 250 nM Taq-Man Minor Grove \nBinding (MGB) L. pneumophila-specific probe labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein \n(FAM) (Y\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2005). To detect PCR inhibitors, an internal positive control (IPC; \ndescribed previously by Y\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2005) that is amplified simultaneously with the \ntarget DNA by the same primer set, was added to each reaction. Amplification was \nperformed using an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, \nCA). The thermal profile for both designs was 2 min at 50\u00b0C (activation of UNG), 10 min \nat 95\u00b0C (activation of the AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase), followed by 40 cycles of 15 \ns at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C.\n2.7.

Optimization of the PMA protocol on pure L. pneumophila cultures\nPMA concentrations and light exposure times were optimized to discriminate live \nfrom heat-killed L. pneumophila cells in pure cultures. A L. pneumophila suspension \ncontaining 5.3\u00d7104 CFU mL-1 was divided in two identical aliquots. One of them \nrepresented the untreated control, and the other one was exposed to 72\u00b0C for 15 min. \nHeat treatment resulted in a complete loss of culturability as confirmed by plating an \naliquot on appropriate culture medium. A cell suspension of 1,000 CFU mL-1 viable L.  \npneumophila served as growth control and resulted in the expected number of colonies. \nSamples were exposed to different PMA concentrations followed by light-exposure for \neither 2 or 5 min. \nCompared to untreated controls, PMA treatment of live cells exposed to light for 2 \nmin, reduced qPCR signals by 0.3-logs, 0.4-logs, and 0.5-logs for PMA concentrations of \n5 \u00b5M, 25 \u00b5M, and 50 \u00b5M, respectively (Figure 1A). Light exposure for 5 min, on the \nother hand, resulted in qPCR signal reductions of 0.3-logs, 0.5-logs, and 0.6-logs for \nPMA concentrations of 5 \u00b5M, 25 \u00b5M, and 50 \u00b5M, respectively. In samples containing \n200 \u00b5M PMA, a signal reduction of 3-logs was obtained for both light exposure times, \nalthough this reduction was a consequence of unspecific dye-induced qPCR inhibition \n(probably due to residual PMA after DNA extraction), since amplification of the IPC of \nthe PCR reaction was completely inhibited.  \nIn case of the heat-killed cells (Figure1B), a 2 minute light exposure produced a \nsignal reduction of 1.8-logs, 3.0-logs, and 4.0-logs for PMA concentrations of 5, 25, and \n13 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n50 \u00b5M, respectively. Increasing light exposure time to 5 min resulted in substantially \nstronger signal reductions with decreases of 2.4-logs, 3.59-logs and 4.35-logs for the \nthree different PMA concentrations.  As seen for live cells, a PMA concentration of 200 \n\u00b5M resulted in unspecific inhibition as treatment did not only completely abolish the \namplification of the target gene (for both light exposure times), but also of the IPC. Taken \ntogether, treatment with a PMA concentration of 50 \u00b5M followed by 5 min of light \nexposure was considered optimal to achieve a compromise between minimal impact on \nintact cells and at the same time maximal signal reduction for compromised cells.\n3.2. Effect of PMA treatment on viable L. pneumophila\n \nTo investigate the effect of the optimized PMA treatment conditions on live L.  \npneumophila cells, we worked with exponential phase cultures where the great majority \nof cells can be expected to be viable. Cell numbers were determined from the undiluted \n\u2018stock\u2019 culture or serial 10-fold dilutions thereof using culture isolation, qPCR, and \nPMA-qPCR (Table 1). Values determined by qPCR were on average 1.7 log units higher \nthan those obtained by culture isolation. Differences between culture isolation and PMA-\nqPCR were substantially smaller with an average difference of 0.39 log units. In case that \nthe extreme outliers of 0.89 and 1.19 log units were not included in the calculation, the \naverage difference between culture and PMA-qPCR decreased to 0.27 log \nunits. Comparing data obtained from qPCR and PMA-qPCR, PMA treatment resulted in \nan average reduction of 1.3 log units of calculated Legionella cells numbers. The PMA-\n14 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\ninduced signal reduction suggested the presence of a certain proportion of membrane-\ncompromised cells in these \u2018live\u2019 cell suspensions. \n3.3. Effect of PMA treatment on heat-killed L. pneumophila cells\nTo study the effect of the PMA treatment on dead cells, exponential-phase L. \npneumophila cultures containing 5\u00d7105  CFU mL-1, were subjected to heat treatment for \n15 min at 72\u00b0C. As for untreated live cells, cell numbers were determined from undiluted \nculture or serial dilutions there of using culture isolation, qPCR, and PMA-qPCR (Table \n2). As expected, heat treatment resulted in complete loss of growth on culture plates. \nComparing qPCR and PMA-qPCR, PMA treatment reduced the Legionella PCR-\ndetermined cell numbers by an average of 4.45-logs. Taking into account the qPCR \ndetection limit of 2.82-logs, no amplification was obtained when the concentration of \ndead cells was below 5.92-logs (corresponding to 831,000 gu L-1). \n3.4. Effects of PMA on defined ratios of viable and dead L. pneumophila cells \nTo assess the efficiency of PMA treatment to limit detection to viable intact cells \nin the presence of a background of dead cells and in samples containing different cell \nconcentrations, and PCR quantification, defined mixtures containing different ratios of \nviable-culturable and heat-killed cells were subjected to PMA treatment or not, followed \nby qPCR quantification. Results are shown in Table 3. Without PMA treatment, the \nconcentration of genome copies obtained by qPCR correlated as expected with the total \n15 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nconcentrations of cells, independent of the live\/dead ratio. PMA treatment, on the other \nhand, consistently resulted in lower Ct values in the presence of dead cells with values \nbeing closer to the number of living cells than without PMA treatment. However, the \ncorrelation with culturable live cell numbers (meaning with the numbers at the top of the \ncolumns) depended on the number of dead cells present in the mixtures and the ratio \nbetween live and dead cells. The best correlation with the number of living cells was \nobtained in the first column with 6.7 log units of live cells. For lower numbers of live \ncells (meaning for the columns further to the right), the correlations tended to be better \nwith lower number of heat-killed cells whereas increasing number of dead cells tended to \nresult in higher deviation from live cell numbers. This tendency was especially obvious in \nthe presence of 4.7 and 6.7 log units of dead cells, where a strong deviation from live cell \nnumbers was obtained. Overall, the data suggest that the presence of high numbers of \ndead cells exceeded the capacity of PMA to suppress the PCR signal from those cells, \nprobably because the dye did not reach a sufficiently high concentration in the cells to \nsaturate the DNA in the region targeted by the primers.  The results from samples \ncontaining only membrane-compromised cells (last column in Table 3) suggested that the \nlimit of signal exclusion was somewhere above 4 log units of dead cells as PMA \ntreatment could suppress the signal from 4.7 logs per mL of dead cells, whereas the \npresence of 6.7 log per mL of dead cells resulted in a relatively strong qPCR signal \n(equivalent to 3 logs of cells).\n3.5. Natural samples \n16 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nTo investigate the usefulness of PMA-qPCR for the detection of viable L. \npneumophila   in environmental samples, a total of 40 water samples from \u2018clean\u2019 \nenvironments and from 125 different cooling tower samples were tested for the presence \nof Legionella using culture isolation, PMA-qPCR, conventional qPCR (Table 4). \nClean water environments included spas, hotels, hospitals, and tap water (TW) \nwith 10 samples taken for each of these environments from different sites accounting for \n40 samples in total. Of these 40 samples, 23 were negative by all three methods, 12 were \npositive by all three methods, three were positive by qPCR and PMA-qPCR, and two \nwere positive only by qPCR. Results from samples which tested positive for the presence \nof Legionella with at least one of the three methods are shown in Table 4. With the \nexception of Spa 7, PMA-qPCR resulted in lower numbers of genomic units than qPCR \nwith values being in better agreement with the Legionella numbers determined by culture \nisolation. Nevertheless the differences between PMA-qPCR and culture isolation varied \nbetween samples. In Spa 5, Spa 7, Hotel 1,  Hotel 3, Hotel 4, Hotel 5, TW 1,  TW 4, and \nTW 5, the PMA-qPCR results were more than 1 log higher than those obtained by culture \nisolation, whereas in Spa 1,  Spa 6, and Hotel 2 the differences in cell concentrations \ndetermined by the two methods were less than 1 log unit. Interestingly, two samples (Spa \n2 and Spa 3), which tested negative by culture isolation also tested negative by PMA-\nqPCR (meaning that the numbers of Legionella cells was below the limit of detection of \nthese methods, 1.48-log cfu\/L and 2.99-log cfu\/L, respectively), whereas qPCR provided \na positive value. For samples  Spa 4, TW 2  and TW 3, both qPCR and PMA-qPCR gave \npositive results, whereas determination by culture was negative or, more precisely, below \nthe limit of detection. In general, PMA-induced signal reduction in qPCR might indicate \n17 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nthe presence of membrane-compromised cells, whereas the difference between culture \nisolation and PMA-qPCR might indicate the presence of intact non-culturable cells. \n Out of the 125 cooling water tower (CT) samples, a total of 10 samples tested \npositive by at least two of the methods (Table 4). In samples CT 1, CT 3, CT 6, and CT 8 \nthe concentration of cells obtained by PMA-qPCR was higher than that obtained by \nculture isolation indicating that some of the cells in the samples might have been intact, \nbut non-culturable. In samples CT 2, CT 4, and CT 9, the Legionella concentration \nobtained by PMA-qPCR was lower than that obtained by culture isolation meaning that \nPMA-qPCR underestimated the concentration of viable cells in these samples. \n \n3.6. Cytotoxic effects of EMA and PMA on L. pneumophlila \nL. pneumophila cells were exposed to two different concentrations of PMA and EMA \n(100 \u00b5M and 200\u00b5M) after preconditioning exponential cultures at four different \ntemperatures (4, 22, 35 and 44\u00baC) for two hours. Comparisons of plate counts obtained \nafter dye exposure in relation to the counts obtained from non-dye exposed controls are \nshown in Table 5. Exposure to 100 \u00b5M PMA showed only a very modest cytotoxic \neffect, which was not greatly influenced by temperature. Slightly stronger cytotoxity was \nobserved when increasing the concentration to 200 \u00b5M, the strongest effect was seen \nwhen preconditioning the cells at 44\u00baC. Exposure to identical concentrations of EMA, on \nthe other hand, revealed a substantially stronger cytotoxic effect of this dye at the \n18 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nconcentrations studied. The cytotoxity gradually increased for both EMA concentrations \nwhen preconditioning the cells to higher temperatures.\n4. Discussion\nDespite its sensitivity and rapidity, the implementation of qPCR for the direct \ndetection and quantification of L. pneumophila in environmental samples is greatly \nhampered by the method\u2019s inability to differentiate between live and dead cells. We \nassessed in this study the use of PMA combined with qPCR as a potential alternative of \nplate counting to detect and quantify L. pneumophila cells in different water samples. In \nline with previously published protocols for other bacterial species, a first step consisted \nin testing different PMA concentrations and light exposure times for detecting L.  \npneumophila. Whereas increasing PMA concentrations from 5 to 50 \u00b5M did not affect \nthe qPCR signals from live cells, a substantial signal reduction was seen with heat-killed \ncells. A dye concentration of 200 \u00b5M, on the other hand, resulted in complete elimination \nof the signal from dead cells, but also in a signal reduction with live cells probably due to \nunspecific inhibition of PCR amplification as indicated by its impact on the internal \npositive control. Regarding light exposure time, substantially greater signal reduction \nfrom dead cells was obtained by exposing samples for 5 min compared with 2 min, \nwhereas the signal from live cells was not affected by the light exposure time. The light \nexposure time to achieve optimal efficiency of PMA treatment can be assumed to be \ndirectly correlated with the intensity of the bulb in the dye\u2019s excitation wavelength range, \naround 464 nm, and to vary between different light sources. In summary, a dye \n19 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nconcentration of 50 \u00b5M and a light exposure time of 5 min were found optimal with the \nhalogen light source used in this study.  These parameters when applied to heat-killed \ncells resulted in a qPCR signal reduction of more than 4-logs. Similar log reductions were \nreported for a variety of other gram-negative species suggesting that the method shows a \nuniform performance across bacterial species. \n At the same time, our results from different concentrations of heat-killed cells \n(Table 2) and defined mixtures of live and heat-killed cells (Table 3) showed that in \nsamples containing more than approximately 4.5 logs of membrane-compromised cells, \nthe qPCR signal was not suppressed entirely by PMA and false-positive results were \nobtained.  The presence of such high numbers of membrane-compromised cells probably \nexceed the dye\u2019s capacity as its concentration within the cells is not sufficient to modify \nall the DNA in the region targeted by the primers. In this respect the comparison with the \nalternative viability dye EMA is of interest. Chang et al. suggested in a recent study on L.  \npneumophila (Chang et al., 2010) that EMA has a higher capacity to exclude membrane-\ncompromised cells. Comparing the qPCR signal reductions caused by sample treatment \nwith the two dyes, the authors reported that 4-fold higher concentrations of PMA were \nnecessary to obtain a comparable signal reduction of 5 log units as seen with EMA. A \nmore efficient penetration of EMA into membrane-compromised cells was also observed \nby the authors of the current study in previous projects (unpublished results). Apart from \ngeneral differences in membrane permeation properties of the two molecules, this effect \nmight primarily be due to the weaker charge of EMA compared with PMA resulting in \nhigher membrane permeation. More efficient penetration, on the other hand, should result \nin higher intracellular concentrations, increased saturation of DNA, and more efficient \n20 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nsignal reduction. Assuming a final dye concentration of 50 \u00b5M, EMA might have a \nslightly higher signal reduction capacity of up to 5 log units, whereas the limit of PMA is \nrather around 4 to 4.5 log units. Applying high PMA concentrations to force a 5 log \nsignal reduction of membrane-compromised cells is unlikely to present a solution as \nsuggested by the unspecific inhibition of amplification of the IPC when treating samples \nwith 200 \u00b5M PMA as shown in Fig. 1. Considering the potentially different intrinsic \nsignal reduction limits of the dyes, other approaches will be required than increasing dye \nconcentrations. One solution for end point PCR could lie in the increase of amplicon \nlength as suggested for end point PCR (Luo et al. 2010; Nocker et al. 2010), whereas in \nqPCR the amplicon size limit has to be considered. \nOptimization of treatment with a viability dye does, however, not only depend on \nthe efficiency of the exclusion of signals from membrane-compromised cells, but also \ndepends on the efficient exclusion of the dye from live cells. In contrast to the before-\nmentioned study performed by Chang et al (2010), we found a substantially stronger \ncytotoxic effect of EMA in comparison with PMA when exposing live cells to the same \nconcentration of dyes (Table 5). The data suggests that the application of EMA to \nLegionella might suffer from the great drawback of potentially producing false-negative \nresults. This finding is in agreement with previous studies with a range of other bacterial \nspecies describing EMA\u2019s characteristic to penetrate also intact cells (Flekna et al., 2007; \nNocker et al., 2006;  Kobayashi et al., 2009; Pan and Breidt, 2007; Rueckert et al., 2005). \nAlso in a previous study by Chang et al. (2009), EMA-qPCR suggested for some \nenvironmental samples lower L. pneumophila numbers than those determined by plating. \nThe cytotoxic effect of EMA in our study was found to increase when preconditioning \n21 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nLegionella to increasingly higher temperatures before equilibrating the samples to room \ntemperature and adding the dye. This result was in close similarity to the one found for \nListeria monocytogenes by Pan and Breidt (2007) who reported a cytotoxic effect for \nEMA (increasing with the preconditioning temperature), but not for PMA. The result \nvaries from the data found for L. pneumophila preconditioned to 4, 25, and 37\u02daC by \nChang et al. (2010), who did not find a cytotoxic effect for either dye or temperature in \nfinal concentrations of 50 \u00b5M (EMA) and 200 \u00b5M (PMA). The much less pronounced \ncytotoxic effect of PMA found in this study makes us feel comfortable to largely ignore \nthe probability of PMA to produce pronounced false-negative results although in some \nenvironmental samples slightly lower values were obtained by PMA-qPCR than with \nculture (Table 4). In other words, we consider the risk of underestimating the number of \nlive cells with PMA small and considerably less than in comparison with EMA. For \nPMA, this view was supported by the good correlation between PMA-qPCR and plate \ncounting when applying PMA treatment on aliquots of live cells (Table 1). The recent \nstudies applying EMA to Legionella used low dye concentrations in the range of approx. \n6 to12 \u00b5M (Chang et al. 2010; Delgado-Viscogiosi et al. 2010), which might in part \novercome this problem. Low dye concentrations can be assumed to minimize detecting \nthe effects caused by EMA\u2019s tendency to enter live cells, whereas EMA concentrations in \nthe range of 24 to 48 \u00b5M can result in qPCR numbers lower than the ones estimated by \nplate counting (Chang et al., 2009). Future research to optimize treatment and analysis \nparameters will show whether EMA\u2019s membrane leakiness interferes with such efforts.\n \n22 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n In summary, this study demonstrated that PMA reduces the qPCR signal in \nsamples containing dead L. pneumophila with resulting cell numbers correlating \nsubstantially better with plate count data compared to qPCR without prior treatment and \nshows less cytotoxicity than EMA.  We consider the resulting lesser probability of \nunderestimating pathogen numbers an important factor in DNA-based diagnostics of L. \npneumophila. In agreement with previous studies, our data, however, suggest that this \nsignal reduction is limited to a maximum concentration of approx. 4-logs of dead cells. \nFuther investigation will be needed to reduce the PMA-qPCR signal of membrane-\ncompromised cells by one or two additional logarithms. \nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Institute for Small and Medium Industry of the \nGeneralitat Valenciana (IMPIVA) (IMIDTF\/2008\/146 and IMIDTF\/2009\/180).\n23 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\nReferences\nAnonymous, 2005.
