Student \nloans, first introduced in 1990, became the key source of financial support for full-time \nhigher education (HE) students following the 1998 Teaching and Higher Education Act. \nSimilarly, the 2004 Higher Education Act relies on student loans as the mechanism for \nrepaying, on graduation, the new variable tuition fees. So in 2006, students will take out \nloans to meet their living costs and their tuition fees.1\n \nStudent debt was a recurring theme in the lead up to the 2004 Higher Education Act, \nand during the Bill\u2019s second reading. Concern focused on the impact of student debt on \naccess to HE and the Westminster government\u2019s desire to widen participation: now \nsymbolised by their pledge to increase participation to 50 per cent of 18-30 year olds by \n2010 (DfES, 2003). This paper addresses these issues, and in particular whether \nattitudes towards debt amongst prospective university entrants are linked to their \ndecisions to enter higher education. It calls upon the findings from a survey, originally \ncommissioned by Universities UK and the Higher Education Funding Council, of school \nleavers and further education students working toward an HE entry qualification.  \n \nThis paper concentrates on the role of debt in students\u2019 HE entry decisions,  and the \nunique contribution debt and perceptions of debt may play. However, it acknowledges \nForsyth and Furlong\u2019s (2003a) observation that focusing on factors affecting whether or \nnot a student enters HE, may mask other more subtle or \u2018hidden\u2019 disadvantages \nencountered by students from low income families. In particular, it may obscure those \nfactors influencing their decisions about where and what to study. But, in policy terms, it \nis paramount that we have an understanding of what shapes prospective students\u2019 initial \naccess to HE. This is because the government\u2019s target of 50 per cent participation, \nwhich is driving many of their HE polices, is concerned primarily with getting students \nthrough the HE door, and not with which, or what, HE door they enter. \n \nBy way of introduction, the paper charts the rise of student debt, the current \ngovernment\u2019s views on student debt, and existing research on students\u2019 attitudes \ntowards debt. It highlights the absence of studies in the UK that have systematically \nsought to examine the impact of debt on initial access to university. Next, the paper \nreports on the main findings from the survey and demonstrates how debt is a deterrent \nfor would-be students from low social classes, but not for those from other classes.  \nFinally, the paper considers some implications of the findings for policy. \n \n \nStudent funding policies and rising student debt \n \nStudent loans were first introduced throughout the UK in 1990. Yet loans did not become \nthe main source of student financial support for students in England and Wales until the \n1998 Teaching and Higher Education Act, when mandatory maintenance grants for \n                                                \n1 With devolution, student funding arrangements vary within the UK. This article focuses on provision in \nEngland. The 1998 Act applies only to English and Welsh domicile students while the 2004 Act applies only \nto English domicile students. In Scotland since 2000, low-income students can receive bursaries, and \ninstead of tuition fees, students contribute to a Graduate Endowment Fund on graduation. Wales similarly \nintroduced bursaries for low-income students in 2002. At the time of writing the Scottish Executive and the \nWelsh Assembly were undecided about whether to introduce variable tuition fees. For a full exposition of the \nvarious student funding arrangements in the UK see Richards and Woodhall (forthcoming). \n 3\nstudents\u2019 living costs were abolished and replaced exclusively with loans. The Act also \nchanged the methods for repaying the loans on graduation. Repayment became more \nclosely linked to graduates\u2019 incomes while pegging the interest rates to inflation \nremained unchanged. The Act also introduced means-tested tuition fees for the first \ntime. \n \nThe 2004 Higher Education Act similarly relies on student loans as the mechanism for \nrepaying, on graduation, variable tuition fees.  All new English domicile students entering \nuniversity in 2006 will pay these fees, irrespective of their means. In addition, loans for \nliving costs will remain a central feature of student support. However, the value of these \nloans for maintenance will be reduced for those low-income students eligible for a new \nmeans-tested student grant, to be introduced initially in 2004. \n \nThe reforms of student funding since 1990 reflect broader moves in welfare policies \ntowards individualisation, a more individualised concept of public interest, and away from \ncollective provision. They have shifted the costs of going to university away from the \nstate to students, and away from students' families to students themselves. By 2002\/03, \nstudent loans and paid work were the most important sources of students\u2019 income while \nmoney from their families was far less significant (Callender and Wilkinson, 2003). In \naddition, more students were borrowing more money, from more diverse sources of \ncredit, than ever before to fund their education.  \n \nWith the phasing out of grants, more students are taking out student loans and \nborrowing larger sums of money for their living costs. Between 1995\/6 and 1998\/9 loan \ntake-up rose from 59 per cent to 71 per cent, and by 2001\/02 to 81 per cent. Between \n1995\/96 and 2002\/03, the average size of the loan more than doubled from \u00a31,252 to \n\u00a33,130 (DfES, 2004). With their growing value, student loans also form a larger share of \nstudents\u2019 total income  \u2013 nearly a half in 2002\/3 compared with under a third in 1998\/9 \nand a seventh in 1995\/6 (Callender and Wilkinson, 2003; Callender and Kemp, 2000). \n \nStudent loans make up the majority of all students' borrowings. In 2002\/03 student loans \nconstituted 85 per cent of students\u2019 outstanding debt, up from 74 per cent in 1998\/99.2 \nInevitably, with more students taking out loans and borrowing larger sums, student debt \nhas escalated. Some 92 per cent of students graduating in 2003 anticipated leaving \nuniversity with debts compared with 81 per cent in 1999 and 75 per cent in 1996. The \naverage debt of students graduating in 2003 amounted to \u00a38,666. This was two and half \ntimes more than the debts of those who graduated in 1998, and three and half times \nmore than those who graduated in 1996 (Callender and Wilkinson, 2003; Callender and \nKemp, 2000).  \n \nBut debt is unequally distributed. Students who are poor before going to university are \nmore likely to be in debt and to leave university with the largest debts, while better-off \nstudents are less likely to have debts and leave with the lowest debts. In 2003, students \nwhose parental annual income was less than \u00a320,480 owed an average of \u00a39,708, and \nhalf owed more than \u00a310,392. Students with parental incomes over \u00a330,502 owed just \n\u00a36,806. So on graduation, the poorest students were 43 per cent more in debt than the \nrichest (Callender and Wilkinson, 2003). \n                                                \n2 Thus, a lower proportion of students\u2019 total borrowings is now derived from commercial sources of credit \nand overdrafts but the average amount of money students borrow from these sources has risen threefold \nsince 1998\/99. \n 4\n \nThe government and debate on student debt \n \nConcerns about student debt did not come onto the political agenda until Labour\u2019s \nsecond term of office. The Secretary of State for Education, David Blunkett linked access \nand participation to student finances, but never engaged with the issue of student debt \n(Blunkett, 2000). By the time Estelle Morris replaced Blunkett as Secretary of State, the \npolitical climate had changed. Tony Blair on 2nd October 2001 at the Labour Party \nconference declared 'We have to find a better way to combine state funding and student \ncontributions'. Two days later, Estelle Morris, when announcing a review of student support \narrangements, talked explicitly about student debt and said:  \n \n\u2018Four years ago we took the brave and right decision to expand higher education \nby changing the way we funded student support.  However, it was clear during \nthe General election that student debt was a major issue. I recognise that for \nmany lower income families the fear of debt is a real worry and could act as a bar \nto higher education.  I want to make sure that our future reform tackles this \nproblem. Our aim is to get more children from less privileged backgrounds into \nhigher education and we hope to better achieve this by changing the combination \nof family, student and state contributions.\u2019 (DfES 2001) \n \nThe outcomes from this review were incorporated into the government\u2019s 2003 White \nPaper The Future of Higher Education (Cm 5735) and subsequently, the 2004 Higher \nEducation Act. \n \nStudent debt, especially its impact on access and participation in higher education, was \na recurring and prominent theme in the debates leading up to the 2004 Higher Education \nAct and during the Bill\u2019s second reading (Hansard, 27Jan 2004, Col 167-275). Indeed, \njust before the Bill was published, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) issued \na paper entitled \u2018Student loans and the question of debt\u2019  (DfES, 2003) aimed at allaying \nthe concerns of MPs and others.  \n \nIn this DfES paper, the government acknowledges that once tuition fees are introduced, \nstudent debt will rise to an average of \u00a315,000 by 2009\/10 (which is probably a \nconservative estimate).  However, it argues, that \u2018\u2026debt need not be a significant \ndeterrent\u2019 (DfES, 2003 p 8) because higher education is a good investment, the costs of \nborrowing through the student loan system are reasonable, and student loan \nrepayments are affordable. In other words, underpinning these policy arguments is \ncapitalisation theory which is uncontextualised, and devoid of acknowledgement of the \nopportunities and constraints affecting investment decisions and the accrual of benefits. \nMoreover, the policy rhetoric focuses exclusively on HE as a private investment for \nprivate returns rather than as a public investment for public returns. In turn, this signals \nthe onset of the decline in the public mission of HE with moves towards the \nmarketisation of HE. \n \nIn addition, the document explicitly questions the notion of debt by putting the word \u2013 \ndebt - in inverted commas, when it asks: \u2018Does student \u201cdebt\u201d deter people from \nparticipating in higher education\u2019?  \n \n \n \n 5\nThe DfES paper goes on to admit that: \n\u2018\u2026 the Government does recognise that perception of debt is an issue. This will \nneed to be addressed by ensuring that there is accurate and easily assessable \ninformation about the student support package and the loan repayment scheme. \nThere are also specific groups for whom debt is more of an issue than students \nat large: students from poorer backgrounds, lone parents and ethnic minorities \nfor example. The student support package has been designed with these groups \nin mind.\u2019 (DfES, 2003, p 9) \n \nThe paper continues that \u2018\u2026addressing issues of debt is just one way in which \nparticipation can be encouraged.\u2019 Other steps need to be taken to encourage more \nyoung people from poorer backgrounds to go to university. \u2018The real deterrents lie \nelsewhere\u2019, and are associated with their lack of attainment and aspirations, and \nambition to apply to universities \u2018\u2026that are the best match for them.\u2019 (DfES, 2003a, p 9)  \n \n \nThe research evidence \n \nWhat is the research evidence that debt or perceptions of debt may impact on the \ndecision to enter HE? There is a considerable body of research that examines the \ncomplex factors affecting young people\u2019s access to higher education. Some of these \nstudies highlight the importance of financial issues. They suggest that financial concerns \nplay a major role in the decision making process of whether or not to enter higher \neducation (Connor et al, 1999; Knowles, 2000; Connor et al, 2001; Davies and Williams \n2001; NAO 2002; Nat West, 2003; Forsyth and Furlong, 2003; Archer et al, 2003), and \nthat the \u2018overriding negative perception of going to university, for all the potential \nentrants, was its cost\u2019 (Connor et al, 2001). Costs are often understood very broadly to \ninclude not only the direct costs of attending university, but also the opportunity costs in \nterms of lost earnings while at university (Connor et al, 2001).   \n \nSimilarly, there is a consensus in this literature that prospective students from lower \nsocio-economic backgrounds are more likely than those from better\u2013off families to report \nthey are deterred by the costs of HE (Woodrow, 1998; Watt, 1999; Woodrow, 1999; \nConnor et al, 1999; Connor et al 2001; Knowles 2000; Forsyth and Furlong, 2000 and \n2003;), as are mature students in contrast to younger students (Connor et al, 1999; \nConnor et al, 2001; Ross et al, 2002). In addition, several of these studies cite fear of \ndebt and the prospects of building up large debts, particularly student loan debt, as a \ndeterrent to university entrance among qualified students, especially from low-socio-\neconomic groups (Forsyth and Furlong, 2000; Connor et al, 2001; Archer et al, 2003; \nForsyth and Furlong, 2003; Callender, 2003). \n \nThe cost of studying, however is not necessarily the main reason that potential entrants \ndecide against going to university, but just one of many reasons. Costs and financial \ndisadvantage are key barriers among a range of cultural, institutional, and dispositional \nfactors that affect individuals\u2019 decisions to participate in post-compulsory education. \nMoreover, financial hurdles manifest themselves in a range of ways, not just in relation to \ninitial access to higher education. Money matters variously affect; access, participation, \n 6\npersistence, and attainment; and consequently have different effects.3  In addition, it is \nrecognised that students exhibit a complex web of attitudes towards money and employ \na range of strategies for debt avoidance.   \n \nThis paper, however, focuses on the role of debt in students\u2019 HE entry decisions rather \nthan debt\u2019s impact on other aspects of students\u2019 behaviour and experiences because of \nenrolment rates are central to government HE policy, especially their 50 per cent \nparticipation target.  A few of the qualitative studies cited above (e.g. Forsyth and \nFurlong, 2000) explore in depth prospective students\u2019 attitudes towards debt within this \ncontext and demonstrate its significance. But, inevitably given their methodological \napproach, they are unable to quantify, in statistical terms, debt\u2019s links with enrolment. \nYet, enumerating this dynamic of debt\u2019s effect is important. When governments seek to \ndevelop evidence-based policy, as a generality, they place greater weight on quantitative \ndata compared with qualitative data. \n \nYet, most of the large-scale quantitative studies treat debt in a superficial manner. They \ntend to rely on rather simplistic questions aimed at eliciting a wide range of potential \nbarriers to HE participation so that debt is treated as just one of a variety of obstacles. \nThese studies do not measure prospective students\u2019 wide ranging attitudes towards \ndebt. Instead, they usually ask one-dimensional questions such as whether students are \nworried about debt or whether debts puts them off university. Nor do they examine \nwhether debt aversion plays a unique deterrence role, after taking into account many \nother reasons why people may opt out of going to university. \n \nA number of studies have considered current HE students\u2019 perceptions of towards debt, \nbut by definition they contribute little to the overall question about its deterrent effects on \nuniversity entry. However, they can give us some insights into students\u2019 borrowing \nbehaviour and by inference, which student groups (and potential students) may be debt \naverse.  \n \nThese studies found a consensus among existing students that debt deters others from \nentering higher education (Callender and Kemp, 2000; NUS, 1998; Hesketh, 1999), \nespecially those from poorer families and those who are non-traditional students (Marks, \n2001). A regular survey of students at one university shows that the proportion agreeing \nthat student loans may put off some from entering higher education has fluctuated over \ntime but rose dramatically following the introduction of the 1998 Teaching and Higher \nEducation Act (Shorley et al, 2001). \n \nOther studies suggest that students respond differently to debt and those with similar \nincomes but divergent characteristics may adopt different attitudes towards their financial \naffairs and debt (Hesketh, 1999; Scott et al, 2001). For instance, Hesketh\u2019s small-scale \nstudy of existing students conducted in the early 1990s, found that the majority were \nlargely confident in their money matters, particularly middle class students because they \nhad the necessary resources to survive. More importantly, they could secure additional \nfunds if required. Less confident students were predominantly working class. They had \nless money and were less confident that they could secure the resources needed \u2013 both \n                                                \n3 These issues are the focus of another paper \u2013 see Callender (forthcoming) The impact of tuition fees and \nfinancial assistance on access to HE in England in Johnstone et al Cost-sharing and accessibility with \nrespect to HE in mature economies, Kluwer \n \n 7\nbecause they were suffering from shortfalls in the assessed contribution from their \nfamilies, but also because they were reluctant to take out loans, primarily because of a \nnegative family attitude towards debt. The most anxious students were those that \nthrough financial necessity had taken out loans, but had not come to terms with the debt \nthey had incurred. \n \nThere has been a steady rise in student loan take-up, although take-up rates remain \nuneven among certain student groups. Take-up is also associated with the use of other \nforms of credit. Indeed, Scott and Lewis (2001) found that the only significant factor \npredicting students\u2019 acceptability of credit and debt was student loans. Callender and \nKemp (2000) found that students with loans were significantly more likely than those \nwithout them to have other commercial credit commitments of over \u00a3500, even after \ncontrolling for various factors. Similarly, Callender and Wilkinson (2003) showed that in \n2002\/03 72 per cent of students with loans also had other forms of commercial credit \ncompared with only 46 per cent of students without loans. Moreover, the proportion of \nstudents relying on commercial credit had risen since 1998\/99, as had the average \namount they borrowed from these sources. And like other studies on the use of credit \ncards (Pahl, 1999), there were gender differences with men being more likely to use \ncredit cards and borrowing more money. \n \nSuch changes signal a transformation in students\u2019 behaviour, and suggest changing \nattitudes towards debt. However, it is impossible to ascertain whether these trends (and \nstudents\u2019 increasing use of commercial credit), reflect broader changes in society\u2019s \nattitudes towards credit and debt, especially among young people, or result from other \nfactors such as the reform of student funding arrangements. Evidence does suggest that \nstudents are more resigned to student loans (Barclays, 2002), but their attitudes towards \nthe student loan system, and student loans in principle, are becoming more negative \n(Shorley et al, 2001).  \n \nNone of these studies, however, allow us to estimate exactly how many or what \nproportion of potential students have opted out of HE because of debt.  None of them \nsystematically examine the impact of debt on access to HE. In fact, there are no \ncomprehensive studies in the UK that do this in a methodologically robust way, \ncontrolling for demographics, a general orientation towards the benefits of going to \nuniversity, encouragement received from family and friends, and other factors.  Ideally, \nsuch a study would be longitudinal, tracking individuals over time. It would need to \ncompare those entering HE with those who do not. It also would require detailed \ninformation on their attitudes to debt, as well as data on their financial circumstances.  \n \nThe absence of suitable data sets to conduct such studies means that it is not possible \nto reach any firm conclusions about the impact of debt on prospective students\u2019 actual \nbehaviour, choices, and decision-making. However, it is possible to explore potential \nstudents\u2019 attitudes toward debt from cross-sectional studies, although few studies have \nattempted this. Yet, the relationship between attitudes towards debt, and actual debt, is \nnot clear. We cannot assume that attitudes towards debt affect borrowing behaviour. \nBoth cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1962) and self-perception theory (Bem, \n1972) suggest that if people must acquire debt, they will adjust their attitudes so that \nthey accept debt.  \n \nThe gaps in the existing research prompted this new study. It is not the ideal, \nlongitudinal study. But, unlike other pieces of empirical work, it focuses explicitly on \n 8\nprospective students, and specifically explores the relationship between their attitudes to \ndebt and their decisions about whether or not to enter HE. And significantly, unlike other \nstudies, it quantifies the probability of prospective students opting out of HE because of \ntheir attitudes to debt.  The full findings of the study are described elsewhere (Callender, \n2003). Here we concentrate in more detail on the issue of debt and access to HE. \n \nMethod \nThis survey of prospective HE students \u2013 final-year students in Further Education \nColleges (FE) and in school sixth forms, studying for qualifications that allow entry to HE \n\u2013 was conducted on a stratified random sample of schools and colleges in 2002. Data \nwere collected using in-class self-completion questionnaires, handed out to pupils by \nteachers. There were two response rates: one by institution and one by student. On the \nfirst, 101 institutions (at 101 sampling points) agreed to take part with 82 (81 per cent) \nreturning completed questionnaires. On the second, 1,954 out of 3,582 sent \nquestionnaires were returned completed, yielding a 55 per cent response rate. Final data \nwere weighted to the national profile of students by establishment type and qualification \ntaken. For more details of the methodology see Appendix I of Callender (2003).  \n \nThe sample \nThe majority of respondents fell into the following separate categories: female (59 per \ncent); under the age of 25 (94 per cent); white (81 per cent); single (91 per cent); and, \nchildless (95 per cent). Just over half (55 per cent) came from families in the top three \nsocial class while just over a quarter were from the lower three social classes. Two-thirds \nof all respondents were studying in the FE sector, which included general FE colleges \nand sixth form colleges. This left just over a quarter of all those surveyed attending state \nsecondary schools, and less than one in ten attending private schools. Of the \nqualifications being pursued, nearly half of all respondents were taking A- or A\/S-levels \nor Scottish Highers; most of the rest were studying for some type of Level 3 vocational \nqualification.  Just under two in five of those studying A-levels anticipated getting high \ngrades (BBC+). In addition, nearly three-quarters had decided to enter HE and had \nalready or intended to apply for a place. A further 12 per cent were still undecided. This \nleft 15 per cent who had decided not to enter HE. \n \nTable 1 shows considerable variation between respondents depending on the type of \neducational institution they attended. While the majority of those attending both state \nschools and in FE colleges were women, most of the pupils at independent schools were \nmen. The age distribution of school leavers in both the public and private sector was \nsimilar \u2013 all were aged under 25; nearly all were single and childless. However, a sixth of \nFE students were over 25 and around one in ten had a partner and\/or children.  \n \nINSERT TABLE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \nOne of the biggest differences between respondents at the different types of educational \ninstitution was their social class composition. Pupils at independent schools were far \nmore likely to come from families where the chief earner was in a managerial or \nprofessional occupation. Nearly two-thirds were from such families \u2013 double the \nproportion in the FE sector. In addition, nearly 90 per cent of pupils at independent \nschools came from families in the top three social classes, compared with close to 60 \nper cent attending state schools and a half studying in the FE sector. Those studying in \nthe private sector came from the wealthiest families; those in FE were from the poorest \nfamilies. \n 9\n \nRespondents\u2019 qualification, expected A-level grades and HE entry decision, all of which \nwere interlinked, were also associated with the type of educational institution they \nattended. Thus, all independent school pupils were taking A-levels, nearly three-quarters \nexpected high grades, and most had decided to go on to university. By contrast, the \nmajority of FE students were taking vocational qualifications, only a quarter were taking \nA-levels, and less than a quarter of them anticipated getting high scores. In contrast to \nindependent school pupils, just over two-thirds of FE students had decided to go to \nuniversity. \n \nMeasuring debt attitudes \nAs suggested, qualitative studies have highlighted students\u2019 complex web of attitudes \ntowards money and strategies for debt avoidance in relation to participation in general \n(e.g. Forsyth and Furlong, 2000 and 2003). However, neither these studies nor any \nquantitative studies have singled out students\u2019 attitudes towards debt per se, and \nattempted to quantify their impact on HE entry. The quantitative studies adopt simplistic \nmeasures of debt, which do not capture how students feel about debt and what it means \nto them. In our measures of debt, we try to tap deeply held beliefs about debt and money \nmanagement in general, using validated indicators.4  \n \nTwo aspects of attitudes toward debt were measured: general levels of debt aversion \nand a more specific cost\/benefit balance judgement concerning university. In order to \ngauge general debt aversion, students were asked the extent to which they agreed or \ndisagreed with three attitude statements: \u2018Owing money is basically wrong\u2019; \u2018There is no \nexcuse for borrowing money\u2019; and, \u2018You should always save up first before buying \nsomething\u2019. Exploratory factor analysis was used to calculate factor scores on these \nthree items, creating one variable that reflected students\u2019 levels of debt aversion or \ntolerance (see Table 2). \n \nINSERT TABLE TWO ABOUT HERE \n \nThe same procedure generated a second variable: the perceived balance of the costs \nand benefits of going to university (see Table 2). This was measured by asking \nrespondents to agree or disagree to four attitude statements: \u2018Borrowing money to pay \nfor a university education is a good investment\u2019;  \u2018Student loans are a good thing \nbecause they allow students to enjoy university life\u2019; \u2018Students do not worry about their \ndebts while at university because they will get well-paid jobs when they graduate\u2019; and, \n\u2018It is not worth getting in debt just so you can get a degree\u2019 (recoded). Together, these \nmeasures solicited from prospective students some kind of balance of their perceptions \nof the debts they might accrue against their attitudes towards the short-term and long-\nterm benefits of HE.  \n \nResults \n \nWas social class related to attitudes toward debt? \nThe social class measure collapsed a six-level variable \u2013 a variant of the UK\u2019s Office of \nNational Statistics\u2019 Social Economic Class schema \u2013 into three categories. Those \nassigned to the lower-income group were from a family where the main earner in the \n                                                \n4 The indicators used were derived from Davies and Lea (1995) and Lea, Webley and Bellamy (2001) who \nhave validated them. \n 10\nhousehold was in a semi-routine or routine profession, or had never worked, or was in \nlong-term unemployment. The medium class group was comprised of those where the \nchief earner was in an intermediate or lower-supervisory\/ technical occupation or was a \nsmall employer or own account worker. The upper class group contained those where \nthe main earner was in managerial or professional employment.5\n \nThere were statistically significant differences in the attitudes toward debt (both debt \naversion and the cost\/benefit balance) between social classes. Those from the lower-\nincome group were more debt averse than those in the middle and upper classes \n(p<.0005; F2,1439 =9.748). Similarly, those from the lower-income group saw a more \nnegative balance between the costs and benefit of going to university (e.g. the costs \nloomed comparatively larger than the gains) than those in the middle and upper class \ngroups (p=.003; F2,1408 =5.738).  \n \nBut it was important to control for other factors while considering such difference, thus \nidentifying the unique contribution of attitudes toward debt. Table 3 shows that the lower-\nincome group was more debt averse than the other groups, even after holding constant \nthe type of educational institution they attended (e.g. state school, Further Education \nCollege), gender, ethnicity and age.  \n \nINSERT TABLE THREE ABOUT HERE \n \nIn contrast, the class effect on the cost\/benefit balance was not statistically significant \nonce one added other explanatory variables into the regression model (not shown here \nfor reasons of space). These additional explanatory variables were educational \ninstitution, gender, ethnicity and age \u2013 as with debt aversion (Table 3). But also included \nwere four factors that represented a general orientation towards university: perceptions \nof the effect of university on the future career, the importance of going to university as a \nsocial and lifestyle experience, the degree of encouragement received from family and \nfriends, and a general sense of what university is actually like6.  \n \nWho is opting in and who is opting out? \nTable 4 shows the percentages of those from key sub-groups who have applied\/are \nintending to apply to university; who have decided not to apply; or are unsure. It is \nstriking that the vast majority of those going to an Independent school were opting in to \nHE. Other groups most likely to apply were those from the higher social class, non-\nWhite, over 21, studying for A\/AS-levels\/Scottish Highers and an Access course, and \nthose A-level students with higher expected grades.  \n \nINSERT TABLE FOUR ABOUT HERE \n \n \n                                                \n5 Of course, the social class categories should not be seen as strictly hierarchically ordered, nor should they \nbe seen as reflecting mutual exclusivity in terms of bands of income or other criteria. There may be \nsignificant overlap on many of the criteria that determine social class between individuals in each of the \ngroups \u2013 groups that John Goldthorpe prefers to call the \u2018working class\u2019, the \u2018intermediate class\u2019 and the \n\u2018salariat\u2019 (personal communication, 2004). \n6 These factors were included in this OLS regression, and not in the OLS regression for debt aversion, \nbecause the cost\/benefit balance involved some assessment of the benefits of University balanced against \nthe financial costs. It may be that the difference in this cost\/benefit balance across the social classes was \nmerely to do with differential assessments of solely the benefits of University. Controlling for these factors \nallowed one to isolate the unique contribution of perceived benefits balanced against perceived costs. \n 11\nDebt aversion, class and HE entry \nThe next step was to examine whether debt aversion and social class predicted the \ndecision to apply to university. Table 5 presents the results of two logistic regression \nmodels estimated on the entire sample. Model I included as explanatory variables: debt \naversion, socio-economic factors and educational achievement. Model II added the four \nvariables that comprised the general orientation towards university. \n \nINSERT TABLE FIVE ABOUT HERE \n \nModel I shows that both types of attitudes toward debt were important, even after \ncontrolling for educational achievement7. The exp(B) for debt aversion of 1.230 indicated \nthat for every one unit increase (meaning the respondent was getting less debt averse); \nthe odds of applying to university were multiplied by 1.230, or increased by 23%. Other \nimportant factors were: social class, ethnicity, age and whether the mother has been to \nuniversity.  \n \nBut more than this, debt aversion survived the introduction of a broader orientation \ntoward going to university (Model II). This was important. One might argue that attitudes \ntoward debt were part of a cluster of overlapping factors related to HE entry: (a) class, \n(b) educational achievement, and (c) positive attitudes to the benefits and experience of \ngoing to university, and receiving encouragement from family and friends to apply. If we \ndid not include all these in the regression model then it might be that debt attitudes \nsomehow \u2018swallowed up\u2019 the variance, or acted as a proxy for these other factors. Yet \ndebt attitudes remained statistically significant even after controlling for these other \nexplanatory variables. This substantially increased our confidence in the finding that debt \naversion was a deterrent factor, at least when testing the model on the entire sample.  \n \nModel II also showed that the cost\/benefit balance was no longer statistically significant \nonce one controlled for factors such as perceptions of the benefits of going to university, \nthe degree of encouragement received from family and friends to apply, and having a \ngood or bad sense of what university was actually like. As such, attitudes towards the \npositive aspects of university were more important in deciding to apply than the \nbalancing of benefits against financial costs.  \n \nOverall then, debt aversion had a significant impact on HE entry, looking across the full \nsample. Holding everything else constant, the most debt tolerant individual in our sample \nwas just over five times more likely to apply to university than the most debt averse \nindividual8. The cost\/benefit balance remained important until one included all the other \nexplanatory factors, upon which the effect lost its statistical significance.  \n \nWas debt aversion a greater deterrent to those from lower-income households? \n                                                \n7 This was a summary of the predicted grade data for A level and Scottish Higher students. The students \nwho were not taking A levels or Scottish Highers were given a zero in the predicted grade variable that \nwould otherwise range from 1 (1-199, less than EEE) to 8 (360+, or AAA+). Two dummy variables were also \nincluded, which indicated whether students were working towards AS levels or \u2018other qualification\u2019. Thus, we \ncan see the effect of type of qualification, comparing the effect of doing either AS levels or an \u2018other\u2019 \nqualification to being either an A level or Scottish Higher student with zero expected grades (Table 1).   \n8 The range for the debt aversion variable was 4. Multiplying the beta coefficient of 0.407 (from Model II) by \n4 and taking the exponential gave a figure of 5.09. The odds of moving from the minimum (the most debt \naverse) to the maximum (the most debt tolerant) were thus multiplied by 5, holding all other factors constant. \n 12\nSo far we have shown that, on average, debt aversion was a deterrent to applying to \nuniversity. We have also shown that those in the lower-income group were more debt \naverse than those in the middle and upper classes. However, it may be that our analysis \nof the whole sample masked variability among particular sub-groups; it may be that the \neffect of attitudes toward debt on HE access was different according to social class.  \n \nTo address this issue we introduced interaction terms into the logistic regression models, \nestimating whether class moderated the impact of attitudes towards debt on HE entry. \nTable 6 presents the parameter estimates of two logistic regression models. The lower-\nincome group was the referent category for both models. \n \nStarting with Model I, debt aversion had a statistically significant effect on HE entry \namong those in the lower-income group (see the main effect). But this was not the case \nfor those in the middle class group. There was a statistically significant interaction \nbetween debt aversion and membership of this category (the beta coefficient of -.494 \nbalancing out the .423 for the main effect). For the higher social class, the interaction \nterm was not statistically significant, although the beta coefficient of -.067 meant the \neffect was a little weaker than in the case of the lower-income group.  \n \nINSERT TABLE SIX ABOUT HERE \n \nWe then included the full set of explanatory variables into the model. Here, the effect of \ndebt aversion for the lower social class group was even stronger (Model II from Table 6). \nThe interaction term for the middle-class group remained statistically significant, while \nthe interaction term was very close to significance for the upper-class group.  \n \nOverall then, debt aversion was a factor for those from the lower income group, but not \nfor those from the middle-class. The effect was on the cusp of statistical significance for \nthe upper-class group. \n \nBut what about the more specific attitudes toward the debt: the balance of perceived \ncost against perceived benefit? Among the lower income group, the cost\/benefit balance \nwas not a statistically significant predictor in Model I or Model II (Table 6). In addition, the \ninteractions between the cost\/benefit balance and middle and higher social class \nmembership were not statistically significant; while the beta coefficients of the interaction \nterms indicated that the effect increased with a movement from the lower class to the \nmedium and (particularly) the higher class, we did not have enough evidence to say this \nwas something other than sampling variation.   \n \nTesting the models for each social class group \nWe then tested the models for each social class group individually. While this was a \nlargely exploratory approach, it was to some degree illustrative because it provided a \nsummary of the various factors that were important for each group. The parameter \nestimates are not included here for space reasons.  \n \nFor the lower-income group, the following factors were important: ethnicity, age, debt \naversion, perceptions of the effect of going to university on future earnings, receiving \nencouragement from family and friends and knowing what university is like. Educational \nachievement was statistically significant in Model II.  \n \n 13\nFor the middle-class group, the following factors were important: going to a state school, \nethnicity, age, educational achievement, perceptions of the effect of university on future \nearnings and encouragement received from family and friends.  \n \nFor the upper-class group, the following factors were important: the effect of going to \nuniversity on future earnings and encouragement received from family and friends. In \nModel I age and the cost\/benefit balance were also important. In Model II ethnicity was, \nbut age and the cost\/benefit balance were not. Nor was debt aversion \u2013 the interaction \neffect was on the cusp of statistical significance (Table 6) so one could conclude that \ndebt aversion had a very weak deterrent effect, if any, for this group. \n \nTesting the model on the A-level students \nSo far we have seen that debt aversion was an important factor only for those from \nlower-income homes, and the jury is out for the upper class (Table7). The cost\/benefit \nbalance was significant for those from the middle and upper class in simpler models but \nit did not survive the introduction of the full range of explanatory factors into the model. \nThus far, debt aversion had a deterrent factor, but there was only good evidence for this \namong those from lower-income families.  \n \nBut it was important to test the models on one more sub-group \u2013 this time the A-level \nstudents. Recall that the measure of educational achievement comprised predicted A-\nlevel grades (with those not pursuing these qualifications set at a base-level of zero). \nConsequently, full information for this important control variable was only available for \nthe A-level student group.   \n \nTable 7 shows that, among A-level students, neither debt aversion nor cost\/benefit \nbalance was statistically significant in Model II, and indeed debt aversion was not in \nModel I. In fact, testing the bivariate relationship indicated that debt aversion was not \nstatistically significant among this group. So, when considering A-level students, where \nwe could more satisfactorily control for educational achievement, debt aversion did not \nhave a deterrent effect on HE entry.  \n \nINSERT TABLE SEVEN ABOUT HERE \n \nHowever, might it be that A-level students had, on average, a different socio-economic \ncomposition to those not taking these qualifications? Put another way, were there more \nmiddle- and upper-class students in the A-level sub-sample? Recall that debt aversion \nwas only an issue for those from lower-income families. Might it be that there were \nsimply too few such individuals taking A-levels? \n \nTable 8 shows that the two groups were indeed different, in terms of social class, type of \neducational institution being attended, whether their mother had gone to university, and \nwhether they were intending to apply to university. There were only 84 A-level students \nfrom the lower-income group compared to 200 in the middle-class group and 332 in the \nupper-class group. So when we tested the model on this sub-group, we were mostly \nfocusing on individuals from the middle and upper classes. This might explain why debt \naversion was a factor for the entire sample (Table 5) but not for the A-level students \n(Table 7).  \n \nINSERT TABLE EIGHT ABOUT HERE \n \n 14\nWe also tested a simple interaction effect model containing class, debt aversion and the \ncost\/benefit balance (Table 9). Neither debt aversion nor the cost\/benefit balance was a \nstatistically significant predictor of applying to university for any class. This was \ninteresting. It was not that the introduction of educational achievement into the model \nmade the difference, now that we could mobilize this control variable more effectively. \nRather debt aversion was not a factor even at the bivariate level for this group. When we \ncould control for educational achievement most efficiently we found that it was not \nnecessary to do so: debt aversion was not an important predictor in the first place. \n \nINSERT TABLE NINE ABOUT HERE \n \nBut again we must go back to the small number of A-level students from the lower-\nincome group; there were only 84 A-level students from low-income families, with only \n11 who had decided not to apply to university. While the partial regression coefficient \nwas not statistically significant, the point estimate of 0.309 (Table 9) was close to the \neffect size when looking at the same effect for the whole sample (0.423 \u2013 see Table 6). \nStandard errors increase simply as a function of an increase in sample size; it was \npossible, even probable, that the small n was simply not large enough to adequately \ndetect an effect in the population.  \n \nWhere did that leave us? \nOn the one hand debt aversion was a factor among those from a lower-income group \nnot taking A-levels. On the other hand it seemed not be a factor among those from a \nlower-income group who were taking A-levels. Yet each had a caveat. We could not \ncontrol for educational achievement as well as we hoped for those not taking A-levels. \nFor those who were taking A-levels we had a very small sample size for people from \nlower-income families. \n \nPerhaps the wisest conclusion is that we simply cannot say whether the small sample \nsize was the reason why the effect of debt aversion among A-level students from the \nlower-income group was not statistically significant. Certainly no firm inferences should \nbe made one way or the other about whether the effect holds in the population of A-level \nstudents. Moreover, we cannot say whether the failure to control for educational \nachievement was the reason why debt aversion had found to have a deterrent effect \namong those from lower-income families among students not studying for A-levels.  \n \nHowever, the findings did point towards a deterrent effect for debt aversion among those \nfrom lower-income families not taking A-levels. We cannot say the same thing for those \nstudying for A-levels. \n \n \nDiscussion and conclusion \n \nOur findings suggest that debt aversion is a class issue. Students from poorer \nbackgrounds are more debt averse than those from other social classes.  Among those \nstudying for vocational qualifications such as NVQs, GNVQs, SVQ Level 3s and AVCEs \ndebt seems a deterrence to HE. But this is only for those from lower-income families. It is \na deterrence even after controlling for their aspirations and career\/work objectives, the \namount of encouragement they receive from their family and friends, and a whole host of \nother socio-demographic variables. As such, debt aversion cannot be subsumed within \nclass-related predispositions toward HE.  \n 15\n \nThis finding has important implications for the Westminster government\u2019s widening \nparticipation policies. Only around 45 per cent of young people with Level 3 vocational \nqualifications go on to university by the age of 21 compared with a 90 per cent entry rate \namong those with A levels (Corney, 2004). Thus there is considerable scope for \nincreasing HE participation among the former, unlike the latter. They are a pool of HE \nentrants frequently overlooked but tend to come from lower-socio economic groups than \nA level students. Therefore, focusing on vocational students, could help the government \nto achieve its target of 50 per cent participation and to widen rather than just increase \nparticipation.  \n \nMore research is needed in order to more adequately control for educational \nachievement. This study was hampered because the only data available were predicted \nA-level grades, and there was only a small number of A-level students from lower-\nincome families. We simply were not able to assess whether debt aversion had a \ndeterrent effect for those from poorer backgrounds studying for these qualifications. \n \nAnd of course, the ways people approach, make sense of and manage debt is complex \nand multifarious. Elsewhere, for example, we show that debt aversion was a factor in \nprospective students\u2019 decisions regarding their choice of university. It was an important \nfactor among low-income students for picking a university where the cost of living were \nlower; was near their home; and where the prospects of term-time employment were \ngood.  It may be that conceptualising attitudes toward debt in a different manner may \nalter the findings, but we think our study offers a valuable baseline on the top-line \naspects of debt aversion. \n \nWorking class students are more likely than their more affluent peers to leave school \nearly, and so lack the qualifications required for university entrance. Even, when they do \nremain in post-compulsory education, they are still less likely to take A Levels -the \u2018gold \nstandard\u2019 HE entry qualification - and to do well in them. Thus, attainment and ability are \nseen as the most important factors determining HE access and are central to increasing \nand widening participation (HEFCE, 2001). However, these differences in staying on \nrates and attainment, in turn, are associated with disadvantage. Hence, as Forsyth and \nFurlong (2000) have suggested, when analysing access to university, there is a need to \ndistinguish between the factors that qualify young people for higher education, and those \nthat predispose them to attend. \n \nAnd, as this study has also shown, educational ability is only part of the story. Similarly, \nraising achievement levels is only a partial answer to the access challenge. Neither are \nthe only factors influencing participation, as suggested by the government and other \ncommentators.  All the respondents in the study were in their final year working towards \nan HE qualification, either at school or at a FE College. It is unlikely, therefore, that HE \nwas a non-choice, an option that lay outside their normal social landscapes. For most, \nHE was a choice and something they had to decide upon, even if this meant refusal and \nrejection. And a key factor associated with low-income students\u2019 rejection of HE was \ndebt aversion, irrespective of their academic ability and a range of other attitudes toward \nHE. Using Forsyth and Furlong\u2019s distinction \u2013 their concerns about debt did not \npredispose them to enrol in HE. Thus, debt aversion cannot be wished away by policy \nmakers: it is not \u201cjust a trite way of saying that people do not like borrowing\u201d (Schwartz, \n2003). It is a \u2018real deterrent\u2019, and is just as real as students\u2019 attainment and aspirations. \n \n 16\nThe Westminster government also maintains that student debt need not be a deterrent \nbecause HE is a good investment while the costs of borrowing through student loans are \nreasonable, and the repayments affordable. In other words, it justifies student loans, and \nthe ensuing debt, by calling upon arguments about the social and economic returns of \nhigher education. It is assumed that students are willing to take out student loans, and to \naccumulate debts, because they know they will benefit financially and personally from \ngoing to university. In addition, it is presumed that students will be able to afford to pay \noff their loans because of their enhanced human capital. Moreover, the income \ncontingent nature of loan repayments acts as a safety net for those with low earnings \nwho are unable to meet their repayments. It is supposed that students will view student \nloans as a type of long-term investment in their future with minimal financial risks. \n \nClearly, not all the prospective students in our study were convinced by such ideas and \narguments. We have to look to other studies as to why this was the case.  Certainly, the \nsocial context within which individuals view debt and make such cost\/benefit calculations \nare very important in a socially divided society. One such context is the accumulating \nevidence suggests that with rising student debt, entering higher education is an \nincreasingly risky investment decision for low-income students.  Even when such \nstudents do take this risk, they are more likely than their more affluent peers to \nexperience financial difficulties while studying (Callender and Kemp, 2000; Unite\/Mori, \n2004), which affects their academic performance and achievement (Van Dyke et al, \nforthcoming) as well as the chances of completing their courses successfully (Yorke, \n2003; Archer et al, 2003). They also can expect higher than average debts on \ngraduation (Callender and Wilkinson, 2003) but lower than average wages (Naylor et al, \n2001). Indeed, failure, non-completion, financial hardship and high levels of debt are \ninversely related to both social class and the risks involved. The greater the risks and the \nhigher the debt, the lower the rates of return on HE \u2013 a reality totally contrary to market \ntheory. Hence, contrary to the government\u2019s stance, it could be argued that the fear of \ndebt exhibited by the low-income prospective students in our study was rational. Indeed, \nwe are now asking them to borrow more money than their parents may earn in a year. \n \nWhat next? \n \nThe challenge is to move from a model of student funding that acts as a disincentive to \nentry, to one that is neutral in effect, or acts as an incentive, especially for under-\nrepresented groups who are debt averse. To achieve this, the policies have to be \ndesigned to acknowledge the differential impact of different funding tools on diverse \nincome groups. The outcome of a particular policy approach, and the extent to which it \nhas a positive, negative, or neutral impact depends on the funding mechanism, and the \ntargeted socio-economic group. As research in the United States demonstrates, student \nloans have a negative\/disincentive impact on the enrolment of low-income groups \nbecause of concomitant student debt, but a neutral one on mid to high-income groups. \nBy contrast, grants have a positive outcome on the enrolment of low-income groups, and \na neutral outcome for mid to high-income groups. And tuition fees have a disincentive \neffect on the poor and middle-income students but no impact on high-income students \n(St John, 1990; McPherson and Shapiro, 1991 and 1998; St John and Starkey, 1995, \nHeller, 1997 and 2001). \n \nAn incentive approach to student financial support could attract prospective HE students \ncurrently excluded by the funding policies. Such policies already exist in the student \nfinancial support system for instance, in areas experiencing labour shortages such as \n 17\nteaching and those allied to medicine. The idea that student funding should be an \nincentive, lies at the heart of Educational Maintenance Allowances (EMAs), available to \n16-18 year olds. EMAs were designed specifically to change student behaviour, and to \nact as a financial incentive to improve initial access, retention, and achievement levels \nand have successfully raised participation rates in post-16 education (Ashworth et al, \n2001; Middleton et al, 2004). These policies are yet other examples where market \nprinciples come into play. But here, market incentives have been used for public \npurposes, ensuring that FE serves the public good. They are in marked contrast to the \nrhetoric of private investment and private returns. \n \nTo what extent do the provisions of the 2004 Higher Education Act meet this overall \nchallenge? Inevitably, one can only speculate about their potential impact. The new \nmeans-tested grants of up \u00a32,700 to be introduced once variable tuition fees are \ncharged, go a long way.  They are a very welcome development. Their value has \nincreased from \u00a31,000 since they were initially announced in the 2003 White Paper, \npartly because the fee remission for low-income students has been converted into an up-\nfront grant. Consequently, in future all students will have to pay fees, irrespective of their \nmeans. \n \nStudents from families with residual household incomes of \u00a315,210 will receive the full \ngrant, and those whose family income is less than \u00a333,000 will get a partial grant (DfES, \n2003). According to the government, around 30 per cent of all students will receive the \nfull grant.  However, a far smaller proportion of school leavers will receive the full \namount. Data from the Family Resources Survey shows that only 18 per cent of families \nwith a dependent child aged 16-18 have incomes below \u00a315,000 per annum. Moreover, \nyoung people receiving EMAs will not be automatically eligible for the new grant \nbecause the income thresholds for the two grants are different. A missed opportunity, \nwhich detracts from a simplified student funding system. \n \nAt the time of writing, the finer details of these grants were unavailable and any \ndiscussion of their potential impact is only conjecture. The new grants are aimed to \nensure that low-income students who opt for a university\/course charging the maximum \nfee is no worse off than they are now. So for some students, the grant will be given by \none hand and taken away by another. How much students benefit, will depend on a \nvariety of factors including their choice of university. It is impossible to tell whether the \nlevel of the new grant is high enough to overcome prospective students\u2019 fear of debt. \nEven if they receive a grant, students will still take out loans for living costs and thus \neven the poorest will incur some debt.    \n \nIn addition, some students may be eligible for bursaries on top of their grants. All \nuniversities charging the maximum tuition fee will have to give low-income students a \nminimum of \u00a3300. Over and above this minimum, universities will have considerable \nfreedom to be innovative and creative in what financial support they offer. The strength \nof bursaries is also their greatest potential weakness. They are discretionary, rather than \nan entitlement. Each university will decide who to give bursaries to, and how much to \ngive. There will be no standardised eligibility criteria, nor a standardised formula for \ncalculating their value. It is unclear what mechanisms, if any, will be introduced to ensure \nthat the aid is distributed fairly and transparently. Evidence from current discretionary \nstudent funding shows there are inconsistencies and inequities in how funds are \nallocated to students in similar circumstances with similar financial needs, but attending \ndifferent universities. While other evidence from the United States demonstrates that the \n 18\nkey beneficiaries of bursaries are middle and upper income students, not those from low-\nincome families (Heller and Marin, 2002). Inevitably, they will lead to a more complicated \nstudent funding system, which in turn, can act as a barrier to participation. Bursaries will \nbe a lottery. \n \nAs a recent article has commented: \n \n\u201cThere are a plethora of variables that universities are contending with to set the \nbursaries, at the heart of which lie two apparently incompatible imperatives: social \nresponsibility and market forces. Among the questions institutions are grappling with are: \ndo universities give lots of little bursaries or a few big ones and what effect will that have \non the market? Do you give them exclusively to the needy, or do you use them as a \nsweetener to entice students on to less popular courses? If you give only to the needy, is \nthere a danger that some courses will fold?\u201d (Curtis, 2004) \n \nThe extent to which student debt rises or falls in the future will depend largely on \nstudents\u2019 choice of university and the amount of tuition fees they have to pay. This too is \nlikely to affect the balance between the costs and benefits of HE. In our study, \nundertaken before the introduction of variable fees, the benefits of HE outweighed the \ncosts for students from middle and higher class families. Once the costs of HE rise \nsubstantially for these students, their assessment of the relative costs and benefits of HE \nmay change too. Financial considerations and concerns about debt may, in future, \ninfluence the HE decisions, choices, and behaviour of a wider range of students than \nthey do now, especially if the dominant rhetoric about HE remains market driven, and \nthere is a retreat from HE\u2019s public mission. Ultimately, more dramatic changes, outside \nthe remit of the 2004 Higher Education Act, are required to alter radically who goes to \nuniversity in England. Until that happens, universities will remain the preserve of the \nmiddle classes. \n \n 19\nReferences  \n \n \nArcher, L. Hutchings, M. and Ross, A (eds.)
