Inclusion criteria include: expected to be in\ncritical care for at least 48 hours, aged 16 years or over, patients who require parenteral nutrition\nand are expected to have at least half their daily nutritional requirements given by that route.\nPublished: 20 September 2007\nTrials 2007, 8:25 doi:10.1186\/1745-6215-8-25\nReceived: 10 July 2007\nAccepted: 20 September 2007\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/25\n\u00a9 2007 Andrews et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:25 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/25Allocation is to one of four iso-caloric, iso-nitrogenous groups: glutamine, selenium, both glutamine\n& selenium or no additional glutamine or selenium. Trial supplementation is given for up to seven\ndays on the Intensive Care Unit and subsequent wards if practicable. The primary outcomes are\nepisodes of infection in the 14 days after starting trial nutrition and mortality. Secondary outcomes\ninclude antibiotic usage, length of hospital stay, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.\nDiscussion: To date more than 285 patients have been recruited to the trial from 10 sites in\nScotland. Recruitment is due to finish in August 2008 with a further six months follow up. We\nexpect to report the results of the trial in summer 2009.\nTrial registration: This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled\nTrial Number system. ISRCTN87144826\nBackground\nIntensive care unit (ICU) and subsequent hospital mortal-\nity in the UK remains high, with figures of 15\u201320% and\n30% respectively [1]. The cost per ICU bed-day exceeds\n\u00a31,100 based on a mean from all trusts in England and\nWales [2]. In many countries, including the UK, provision\nof intensive care is inadequate to meet demand. Infections\nacquired on the ICU have been associated with a two to\nthree fold increased risk of death [3], this is associated\nwith both illness and drug related impairment of the\npatient's immune system. Multiple portals for infection\ninclude: tracheal tubes, nasogastric tubes, chest and\nabdominal drains, central venous, pulmonary arterial and\nurinary catheters, wounds, and infective loci present\nbefore admission to ICU. These infections increase mor-\ntality, morbidity, length-of-stay, antibiotic usage and costs\nof care. As a result 40\u201350% of patients on ICU are pre-\nscribed antibiotics at any one time [2]. Such concentrated\nantibiotic usage may contribute to ICU, hospital and even\ncommunity antibiotic resistance, which is a major health\ncare issue [2,4-6].\nA European point prevalence study in ICUs showed that\n66% of patients were receiving artificial nutritional sup-\nport, 42% of whom were receiving either parenteral nutri-\ntion alone (23%) or parenteral combined with enteral\nnutrition (19%). [7].\nAlthough the enteral feeding route is preferred to\nparenteral (reduced costs of administration and reduced\nrisk of infective complications from the intravenous line),\nparenteral nutrition (PN) retains an important supportive\nrole in the management of ICU patients, many of whom\ncannot be fed effectively by the enteral route because of\ngastro-intestinal dysfunction [8].\nGlutamine\nStandard amino acid formulations do not contain any of\nthe amino acid glutamine, due to pharmaceutical stability\nproblems. In the past glutamine was considered a non-\nessential amino acid therefore its omission from\nparenteral nutrition preparations was not considered to\nbe a problem, as it was thought that the body would syn-\nthesise its own. Glutamine has essential roles in acid-base\nbalance, nitrogen transport and maintaining muscle mass\nand function, and is an energy source for rapidly dividing\ncells, particularly those of the immune system and gut. As\nthe most abundant amino acid in the body, it is now rec-\nognised that glutamine synthesis and release is insuffi-\ncient to meet demands under severe metabolic stress.\nGlutamine must therefore be supplied from nutritional\nsources if levels are to be maintained. Several studies have\nshown that glutamine levels decrease markedly after\nmajor surgery and during critical illness. Decreased serum\nglutamine has been associated with immune dysfunction\nin animal models and death or infectious complications\nin septic patients. In randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\namongst patients, glutamine-supplemented PN has been\nassociated with improved nitrogen balance, higher intra-\nmuscular glutamine levels, improved mood, enhanced\nimmune cell function and no elevation of proinflamma-\ntory cytokine profile [9-14]. In animal models glutamine\nenhances intracellular glutathione (which combats free\nradical tissue damage) [15]. Such effects of glutamine sup-\nport on the stressed immune system in the patient receiv-\ning critical care could lead to 'successful inflammation', i.e.\nthe ability to combat infection, and decrease the systemic\ninflammatory response syndrome, where excessive free\nradical induced damage occurs.\nThus provision of glutamine could be of considerable\nbenefit in metabolically stressed critically ill patients.\nAlthough the proposed benefits are biologically plausible\nit is unclear whether they will be obtained in practice and\nthere is a danger that glutamine-containing PN solutions\nwill be incorporated into practice without adequate eval-\nuation, thus our evaluation is timely.\nSelenium\nSelenium is an essential trace element found in a group of\nproteins known as selenoproteins and which is present in\nonly modest amounts within standard PN solutions. Sele-Page 2 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:25 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/25nium, through glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin\nreductase is involved in anti-oxidant defences, and also\nhas anti-inflammatory properties [16,17] mediated by\ninhibition of lipid peroxidation. Selenium is also essential\nto the production of thyroid hormones [18]. It is notewor-\nthy that populations in many areas of Europe, including\nScotland, are relatively selenium deficient [17]. Given the\nwidely documented immunosuppression of critical ill-\nness, and its correlation with mortality and the purported\nroles of reactive oxygen species in sepsis, pancreatitis,\norgan dysfunction and other inflammatory conditions, it\nis biologically plausible that enhanced selenium supple-\nmentation could also be of benefit to the critically ill ICU\npatient requiring parenteral nutrition.\nIt can be seen from the above background that both\nglutamine and selenium have the potential to influence\nthe immune system, through different sites in biochemi-\ncal pathways. Thus a factorial design for the proposed RCT\nis appropriate to test the two hypotheses.\nSystematic reviews\nA systematic review of glutamine supplementation in crit-\nically ill (including following major surgery) adults [19]\nfound 14 small RCTs reporting data from 737 patients on\nmortality, infectious complications, and length of hospi-\ntal stay. When both parenteral and enteral routes of sup-\nplementation are combined, complications were lower in\nthe glutamine group (risk ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to\n0.99). There was also a trend towards a reduction in mor-\ntality (risk ratio 0.79, 95% CI .59 to 1.04) and reduced\nlength of hospital stay, especially for surgical patients.\nA more recent systematic review using random effects\nmethods of meta-analysis [20] found that parenteral\nglutamine in critical illness was associated with a relative\nrisk for mortality of 0.75 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.07) and for\ninfection of 0.71 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.05). There was how-\never, evidence of publication bias in the reporting of par-\nticipants' infections. The existing evidence is suggestive of\na positive role for glutamine supplementation but a fur-\nther large trial is required to determine whether any differ-\nences are statistically and clinically important.\nA Cochrane systematic review of selenium supplementa-\ntion in critical illness, has identified seven randomised\ncontrolled trials of sodium selenite supplementation in\ncritical illness [21]. Five trials examined the effect of addi-\ntional selenium supplementation on mortality at 28 days,\nand showed a reduction trend in those supplemented\nwith selenium (relative risk 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17,\nrandom effects model). The relative risk for mortality,\nwhenever determined, for general intensive care patients\nwas 0.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.96, random effects model).\nBased on reported information, these were poor quality\ntrials. Indeed, only one clearly reported concealment of\nallocation and a further three trials undertook intention\nto treat analysis.\nIn a systematic review of antioxidant nutrients in critical\nillness, Heyland and colleagues [22] found that selenium\nsupplementation (alone and in combination with other\nantioxidants) may be associated with reduced mortality\n(RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.08). Clearly, a larger trial to\nexamine the clinical effects of additional selenium supple-\nmentation in this patient group is required.,\nPilot Study\nThe purpose of the pilot study was to test the full protocol\nwith the aim of assessing feasibility and refining PN stock\nmanagement. It was carried out in two Scottish centres;\nAberdeen and Edinburgh. Patients enrolled to the pilot\nstudy were recruited and processed in the same manner as\nthe full trial and we plan to analyse these data in the final\ndata set.\nMethods and Design\nThe questions which this protocol will address\nThe questions which this trial will address\n\u2022 Does the inclusion of glutamine, additional selenium or\nthe two in combination, in a standard preparation of PN\nimprove the outcome for critically ill patients particularly\nin terms of participants with infections, mortality, ICU\nand acute hospital stay?\n\u2022 Is supplementation of PN with glutamine, additional\nselenium, or the two in combination cost-effective?\nTrial recruitment\nThe trial will involve people expected to be on intensive\ncare and high dependency units (levels 2 and 3 care)\nunder the care of the intensive care unit consultants for at\nleast 48 hours, aged 16 years or over, who require\nparenteral nutrition and are expected to have at least half\nof daily nutritional requirements given by that route.\nPregnant women and people whose expected stay in the\nUK is less than six months will not be considered for the\nstudy. Patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clear-\nance < 10 ml\/min and not on renal replacement therapy)\nwill also be excluded.\nIn the case of hepatic failure, metabolism by the liver is\nthe main route of elimination for many drugs and nutri-\nents, but the hepatic reserve appears to be large and liver\ndisease has to be severe before important changes occur.\nRoutine liver function tests (LFTs) are a poor guide to the\ncapacity of the liver to metabolise drugs, and it is not pos-\nsible to predict the extent to which the metabolism of a\nparticular drug or nutrient may be impaired. EnrolmentPage 3 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:25 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/25will depend on the decision of the local physician. How-\never, caution will be advised when:\n1. A 3-fold increase in LFTs above baseline for the patient\nis seen.\n2. Any derangement in liver synthetic function is noted.\nIntensive care unit staff (doctors or nurses) based in each\nclinical centre will identify potential participants. A log\nwill be kept of patients meeting the inclusion criteria,\ndescribing the reasons if they are not subsequently\nrecruited to the trial. The recruitment procedure to be fol-\nlowed is detailed in the SIGNET trial handbook (version\n4 15-03-06).\nInforming potential participants about the trial\nIf the patient is able to give consent, ICU staff (doctors or\nnurses) will describe the study, backing oral information\nwith the standard study information leaflet. If, as is more\nlikely, the patient will be unable to give consent, intensive\ncare unit staff will describe the study to relatives of the\npatient, backing oral information with the standard study\ninformation leaflet.\nConsent to participate\nOnce eligibility has been confirmed, authorised person-\nnel will ask if the potential participant is ready to decide\nwhether or not to join the trial. If so, she\/he will give the\nparticipant a consent form. After the doctor or nurse has\nchecked that the consent form is understood, the nurse or\ndoctor will invite the participant to sign the form, then\nwill add their own name and countersign it. In the case of\nrelatives giving assent, the same procedure will be fol-\nlowed using the consent form. Copies of the signed con-\nsent form and information sheet will be placed in the\nhospital notes. If the participant subsequently becomes\nable to give consent, after assent has been obtained from\nthe relative, the study will be described to the participant\nusing the information sheet and consent form.\nIf the relative is not present and cannot attend the ICU to\nsign the written assent within 24 hours of the patient\nrequiring PN, but is prepared to grant assent based on the\ninformation read out to them over the phone and subse-\nquent discussion, verbal assent will be recorded. Written\nrecord of assent at a later time will be obtained if feasible.\nIn all cases a written information sheet will be provided\nwhen they attend or a copy sent to them by post if they are\nunable to attend. Separate consent forms for verbal con-\nsent have been prepared.\nIn the unlikely event that there is no personal legal repre-\nsentative (next of kin) it is possible to recruit the patient\nto the study, provided a professional legal representative\n(or equivalent in England, Wales or Ireland) has been\nappointed by the hospital for that person.\nInformation collected at trial entry\nOnce a participant has agreed to join the trial, ICU staff\nwill record on a standard form:\n1. Identifying and contact information\n\u2022 Full name, address, telephone number\n\u2022 Date of birth, age on recruitment day, sex\n\u2022 NHS, hospital number and Community Health Index\nnumber (if available)\n\u2022 Marital status, woman's maiden name\n\u2022 Name of a 'best contact', such as a friend or relative, with\ncontact details\n\u2022 General Practitioner's contact details\n2. Descriptive information\n\u2022 Under-nourished, normal or obese, based on subjective\nclinical assessment [23]\n\u2022 Patient groups \u2013 medical, or surgical (including\ntrauma))\n\u2022 APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evalu-\nation) II score\n\u2022 SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score\n\u2022 Severe sepsis or septic shock\n\u2022 Antibiotics\/anti-infectives on recruitment\nThis information will be sent to the Trial Office.\nTrial interventions\nThe trial will use a 2 by 2 factorial design to test not only\nwhether glutamine and selenium on their own are effec-\ntive, but also whether there is extra effectiveness from the\ncombination.\nFor this reason allocation will be to one of four groups, see\ntable 1.\nAll formulated PN bags (1500 ml volume) are isonitroge-\nnous and isocaloric and have been tested for long-term\nstability by Fresenius-Kabi. Standard additions of fluid,\nelectrolytes, vitamins and minerals will be allowed\n(including standard doses of selenium). dditional nitro-\ngen and\/or energy will not however, be allowed in the PNPage 4 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:25 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/25(to retain the isonitrogenous nature of the interventions).\nSupplementation will be given for seven days only (on\nICU and subsequent wards and hospitals if practicable).\nOnce the decision is made to commence PN, it is desirable\nthat SIGNET PN is given from the start. If this is not pos-\nsible SIGNET PN should be started within 48 hours of\ncommencing PN on ITU or HDU. If SIGNET PN is discon-\ntinued for any reason, e.g. line removed, SIGNET PN can\nbe restarted within 48 hours from discontinuation and a\ntotal of 7 days of SIGNET PN may be given. Patients who\nhave been given PN outside of critical care are eligible for\nrecruitment. A patient may be recruited to the trial only if\nthe pharmacy has sufficient stock for 5 days of bags of PN\nat the start of therapy.\nThe volume of feed may be reduced for men under 60 kg\nin weight and women under 70 kg. Consultants on inten-\nsive care may opt not to enter patients into the trial if they\nperceive the patient either to be at risk of refeeding syn-\ndrome, or to require a gradually phased introduction of\nnutrition support.\nPatients entered in the trial will be monitored as is stand-\nard practice in the ICU.\nTreatment allocation\nThe existing central randomisation service (fully auto-\nmated computerised telephone randomisation) in the\nHealth Services Research Unit at the University of Aber-\ndeen will be used to randomise patients. Recruiting staff\nwill telephone the randomisation line and will be asked\nto key in details of identification and important prognos-\ntic factors (see below), when confirming eligibility and\nconsent. Consent procedures will adhere to the 2003\nMental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act. Ran-\ndom allocation to one of the four possible treatment com-\nbinations (see above) will be minimised on trial centre;\nage (<65 years or \u2265 65 years); sex; patient groups (medical\nor surgical (including trauma)); and, patient nutritional\nstatus (under-nourished, normal or obese \u2013 subjective\nclinical assessment [24]. A four digit number for that\npatient will be provided by the automated randomisation\nservice, the research nurse accessing the randomisation\nservice will then inform the centre pharmacy of this ran-\ndomisation number. The trial office, based at the Univer-\nsity of Aberdeen will have provided each pharmacy with a\nlist of these random numbers linked to one of the four\ntreatment allocations, thus maintaining the blinding of\nlocal investigators to the trial treatment. Figure 1 summa-\nrises these arrangements.\nSubsequent arrangements\nInforming key people\nFollowing formal trial entry, the Trial Office or local\nresearch nurse will also contact:\n\u2022 the consultant and ward staff caring for the patient on\ndischarge from the intensive care unit \u2013 informing them\nof participation in the trial and the possible continuation\nof trial treatment.\n\u2022 the general practitioner \u2013 informing the GP practice of\nparticipation in the trial and the (few) implications for the\npractice. This letter includes a brief description of the trial\ntogether with a request that the general practitioner noti-\nfies the Trial Office if the patient dies.\n\u2022 the 'best contact' asking for assistance to complete the\nquestionnaires (see below)\nAdditional information sought by post at three and six \nmonths after entry\nQuestionnaires will be sent to participants by post at three\nand six months post randomisation, which will contain:\ni) The SF-12 questionnaire and the EQ-5D questionnaire\nii) Contacts with health services after discharge\nA cost questionnaire will also be sent to participants by\npost at 6 months to elicit\n(i) Costs to patients and carers (travel costs, time spent\ntravelling and attending appointments, time lost from\nusual activities)\nParticipants will be sent up to two reminders by post if the\nquestionnaires are not returned to the Trial Office.\nTable 1: The trial will use a 2 by 2 factorial design to test not only whether glutamine and selenium on their own are effective, but also \nwhether there is extra effectiveness from the combination.

The Chi-squared test for heterogeneity\nwill be used to explore any apparent differential effects.\nEconomic analysis\nThe underlying aim is to keep economic data collection as\nparsimonious as possible to minimise the burden upon\ntrial participants and participating centres. Data on costs\nto the NHS including treatments, investigations and con-\nsultations will be collected as part of the economic evalu-\nation. The type of economic evaluation performed will\ndepend upon the findings [23]. Both deterministic and\nstochastic sensitivity analysis [27] will be used to explore\nthe importance of the uncertainty surrounding estimates\nof effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness\/utility. NHS\nresource use will be costed using appropriate unit costs.\nThese will be taken from published sources (e.g. drug\ncosts from the British National Formulary and GP cost\nfrom published estimates [28], manufacturers' list prices\n(e.g. consumables, equipment)) or using study-specific\nestimates. QALYs will be calculated using the EQ5D scores\n[29]. The EQ5D has been successfully used to measure\nchanges in quality of life in patients discharged from ICU\n[30].\nPower calculation\nThe primary endpoint for the trial is the proportion of\npatients acquiring infection(s) after starting trial PN. Sys-\ntematic reviews indicate that the reduction in proportion\nof patients acquiring infections in previous trials ranged\nfrom approximately 50% in the control arm to 40% in the\nintervention arm. Removing Griffiths' glutamine trial\n[31,32] \u2013 which only reported infections in a post-hoc\nanalysis \u2013 shows the effect may indeed be greater (from\n50% in the control arm to 30% in the intervention arm).\nA plausible reduction to detect would be the midpoint of\nthese two estimates (i.e. a reduction from 50% to 35%),\nhence 340 participants would be required to detect this\nsize of difference (with 80% power and 2p < 0.05) [33].\nGiven the high mortality rates in critical care patients [1],\nwe have allowed for potential loss of patients to follow-up\nover the six months (see below \u2013 this would primarily\naffect secondary outcomes such as quality of life meas-\nures). We have consequently inflated the sample size\nrequirement by approximately 20%, thus plan to recruit\n500 patients to the trial.\nBased on routine data available from the Scottish Inten-\nsive Care Society (SICS) audit database, the average length\nof ICU stay for patients receiving PN is approximately 9\n(SD 7) days. For a 2 day reduction in ICU stay to be\ndetected, with 80% power and 2p < 0.05, a trial of approx-\nimately 400 patients would be required. As we do not\nexpect any dropout from the trial prior to discharge, we\nare adequately powered to detect this level of change.\nA trial with 500 patients would allow us to detect a quarter\nof a standard deviation (0.25SD) change in hospital\nlength of stay with 80% power and 5% significance\n(assuming all data for length of stay are available).\nA trial of 340 patients would have 80% power and 5% sig-\nnificance to detect differences in Quality of Life measures\nof approximately 0.33SD (a third of a standard deviation\nchange) or 90% power to detect a 0.5SD change. Previous\nresearch in the behavioural field suggests that a 0.5SD\nchange is the level of change that should be associated\nwith a moderate change in quality of life measures\n[34,35]. As such we are well powered to detect meaningful\nchanges in quality of life measures.\nRecruitment rates\nApproximately 900 patients per annum receive PN in\nScottish Intensive Care Units (source: SICS audit data-\nbase). Assuming a conservative recruitment rate \u2013 that we\nrecruit a third of eligible patients \u2013 we expect to recruit the\n500 patients required within a two-year recruitment\nphase.\nData analysis\nAnalysis of dichotomous outcomes will be analysed using\nstatistical tests such the Chi-squared test. Continuous\nmeasures will be analysed using t-tests (with transforma-\ntion of data to Normality if appropriate), or non-paramet-\nric equivalents. A further analysis accounting for the inter-\nrelationship between deaths and length of stay will be\nundertaken, akin to that described for ventilator-free days\nby Rubenfield [26] mentioned earlier. This, for example,\nwould allow the apparently short length of stays associ-\nated with early deaths to be accounted for appropriately.\nA significance level of 2p < 0.05 will be considered as evi-\ndence of statistical significance for the primary outcomes.\nConfidence intervals will also be presented where appro-\npriate. The economic analysis will incorporate sensitivity\nanalysis, and confidence intervals will be constructed\naround stochastic cost data using techniques such as boot-\nstrapping [27].\nOrganisation\nLocal organisation\nEach collaborating centre will identify a principal investi-\ngator. The responsibilities of this person will be to:\n1. establish the trial locally (for example, by getting agree-\nment from clinical colleagues, facilitating local research\nethics committee and trust approval; identifying andPage 8 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:25 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/25appointing a local study nurse; and ensuring that all clin-\nical staff on ICU and the hospital pharmacy are aware of\nthis trial)\n2. agree to follow the trial protocol and to ensure that all\nteam members on his\/her site understand their obliga-\ntions and to conduct the trial to GCP requirements\n3. ensure that all study site personnel are adequately\ntrained and qualified to carry out their delegated respon-\nsibilities and provide support and supervision to these\npersonnel\n4. agree not to start the trial until Main REC, LREC and\nlocal management approval is given\n5. retain all documentation associated with the trial and\nall documentation sent by the Chief Investigator or Spon-\nsor of the trial\n6. report deviations from the protocol to the Chief Inves-\ntigator\n7. report any safety issues to the Chief Investigator\n8. take responsibility for clinical aspects of the trial locally\n(for example, if any particular concerns emerge)\n9. notify the Trial Office of any unexpected clinical events\nwhich might be related to trial participation\n10. report serious adverse events to the Chief Investigator\nwithin 24 hours of the Principal Investigator knowing of\nthe serious adverse events\n11. provide support and supervision for the local study\nnurse\n12. represent the centre at collaborator's meetings\nEach clinical centre may appoint a study nurse to co-ordi-\nnate the day to day aspects of the trial. The responsibilities\nof this person will be to:\n1. keep local staff informed of progress in the trial\n2. keep regular contact with the local principal investiga-\ntor, with notification of any problem or unexpected devel-\nopment\n3. maintain regular contact with the Trial Office\n4. identify potential participants and keep a log of\nwhether or not they are recruited (with reasons for non-\nparticipation)\n5. liaise with PN team\n6. check eligibility, give information about the trial, and\nseek consent\n7. randomise patients and obtain randomisation code\n8. liaise with the hospital pharmacy\n9. collect data describing participants, and send these to\nthe Trial Office\n10. liaise with consultants on other wards after patients\nhave been discharged from ICU\n11. record outcome measures on study CRFs\n12. send study CRFs to Trial Office no more than eight\nweeks after each patient has been recruited\n13. clarify the situation when the Trial Office fails to make\na contact with a local participant, getting in touch by tele-\nphone\n14. seek further clinical details when a major trial event\n(such as a hospital admission or death) is reported to the\nTrial Office, even if this occurs in another hospital\n15. provide support for participants in other ways if there\nare difficulties\n16. represent the centre at trial nurse meetings and collab-\norators meetings\nEach clinical centre will designate study pharmacist(s) to\nco-ordinate the day-to-day pharmacy aspects of the trial.\nThe responsibilities of the local pharmacists will be to:\n1. allocate treatment for the patient according to the\nassigned randomisation code using the SIGNET randomi-\nsation schedule\n2. ensure the allocation is checked by a pharmacist (other\nthan ICU pharmacist if possible)\n3. formulate the PN according to prescription, stability\ninformation and hospital SOPs\n4. label bags appropriately to ensure blinding of treatment\nallocation is maintained at ward level\n5. ensure that clinical trials pharmacists and aseptic phar-\nmacists are the only personnel on site unblinded to treat-\nment allocationPage 9 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:25 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/256. record the use of the SIGNET study PN bags and sele-\nnium if applicable on the accountability log\n7. record the use of bags after every patient has completed\ntheir SIGNET PN on the pharmacy stock control website\n8. ensure that all study site pharmacy personnel are ade-\nquately trained and qualified to carry out their delegated\nresponsibilities and provide support and supervision to\nthese personnel\n9. manage stock levels to ensure sufficient stock of both\nglutamine and non glutamine bags to provide seven days\nof SIGNET PN when patient recruited\n10. ensure that the storage conditions of the Signet Study\nPN bags are adhered to\n11. ensure that there is stability data available for all vari-\nations in the electrolyte profiles of the Signet Study PN\nbags that are used\n12. retain all documentation associated with the trial for\nexample patient worksheets, completed prescriptions,\nstudy drug accountability logs, shipping receipt, destruc-\ntion or disposal documentation, temperature control logs\nand all documentation sent by the Chief Investigator or\nSponsor of the trial\n13. report deviations from the protocol to the Principal\nInvestigator\n14. report any safety issues to the Principal Investigator\nTrial co-ordination\nThe Trial Office\nThe Trial Office is in the Centre for Healthcare Ran-\ndomised Trial (ChaRT), in the University of Aberdeen,\nwhich gives day-to-day support to all clinical centres. It is\nresponsible for collection of data (in collaboration with\nthe local study nurses), data processing and analysis. It is\nalso responsible for randomisation and unblinding, (as\nclinically necessary). The trial coordinator is based in\nEdinburgh and will supervise the day-to-day conduct of\nthe trial under the direction of the Chief Investigator and\nthe Director of CHaRT. The Trial Office will be responsible\nfor submitting annual reports to MREC, MRC, and regular\nreporting of SSARs and SUSARs to MREC and MHRA. It\nwill also produce progress reports to both the Trial Steer-\ning Committee, and unblinded interim reports to the\nData Monitoring Committee (DMC).\nThere will be four staff directly located in the central Trial\nOffice \u2013 the data manager\/secretary, the statistician, the\neconomist and the programmer. These staff members will\nbe supported by senior members of CHaRT (The Director,\nthe Senior Trial Manager and the Senior IT Manager and\nby the Director of HSRU and grantholder). The trial co-\nordinator will be based in the University of Edinburgh but\nwill be in day to day contact with the trial office and will\nbe collocated in the trial office four days a month.\nThe trial co-ordinator will take overall responsibility for the\nday to day conduct of the trial, including supervision of all\ntrial staff, visiting all centres and working with the local\nICU investigators to establish the trial, providing regular\nliaison with the research nurses, arranging all trial meet-\nings, and reporting to the project management group. The\ndata manager\/secretary will be responsible for all aspects of\ndata collection and processing, including processing of\ntrial entry data, data entry, questionnaire monitoring,\nchasing missing information, and follow-up of non-\nresponses. The programmer will establish a database man-\nagement system for efficient conduct of the trial including\nthe randomisation, timely despatch of questionnaires,\nautomatic form monitoring, data validation and cleaning.\nThe statistician will undertake all statistical tasks in the\nstudy including the formal analysis and reporting of the\ndata, progress reports to the Study Committees at study\nend, all under the supervision of the Director of HSRU\n(one of the grant holders).\nA health economist will be responsible, under the supervi-\nsion of the Senior Health Economist (one of the grant\nholders), for the development of data collection forms\n(such as the patient\/carer time and travel questionnaire)\nrequired for the economic evaluation; the unit costs of\nhealth care resources; the analysis of the economic data;\nand the preparation of the economic evaluation compo-\nnent of the final report.\nThe Operations Management Group\nThe Operation Management Group will meet weekly at\nthe Trial Office in Aberdeen, to review day to day progress\nand troubleshoot emerging issues. The Chief Investigator\nvia teleconference will routinely join them.\nThe Project Management Group\nThis consists of representatives from two of the clinical\ncentres, and representatives from the Trial Office. Observ-\ners may be invited to attend at the discretion of the Project\nManagement Group. This will meet regularly during the\ntrial \u2013 typically every 6\u20138 weeks face-to-face or via telecon-\nference.\nThe Trial Steering Committee\nA Trial Steering Committee supervises the trial. This com-\nmittee includes three independent members, together\nwith those originally granted funds to mount the trial.\nObservers from the host University (University of Edin-Page 10 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:25 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/25burgh) and Medical Research Council may also attend.\nOther members of the Project Management Group may\nattend as observers at the invitation of the Chair of the\nSteering Committee.\nData and safety monitoring\nThe Data Monitoring Committee\nA DMC will be established. This will be independent of\nthe trial organisers. During the period of recruitment to\nthe trial, interim analyses will be supplied, in strict confi-\ndence, to the DMC, together with any other analyses that\nthe committee may request. This may include analyses of\ndata from other comparable trials. In light of these inter-\nimfindings, the DMC will advise the Trial Steering Com-\nmittee if one or more of the randomised comparisons in\nthe trial has provided;\n1. proof beyond reasonable doubt that for all or some\ntypes of patients, one particular type of treatment is clearly\nindicated in terms of a net reduction in participants with\ninfection without any increased risk of death or serious\ncomplications (or clearly contraindicated because of a net\nincrease in length of stay or mortality)\n2. evidence that might reasonably be expected to influ-\nence materially the care of people who require PN feeding\nin ICU by clinicians who know the results of this and\ncomparable trials.\nThe Trial Steering Committee can then decide whether or\nnot to modify intake to the trial. Unless this happens,\nhowever, the Trial Steering Committee, project manage-\nment group, clinical collaborators, and trial office staff\n(except the study statistician who supplies the confiden-\ntial analyses) will remain blinded from the interim results.\nThe frequency of interim analyses will depend on the\njudgement of the chairman of DMC, in consultation with\nthe Trial Steering Committee.\nOther safety concerns\nThe incidence of adverse effects from the proposed dosage\nof glutamine and selenium is anticipated to be very low \u2013\nin the systematic reviews safety issues were not a concern.\nCollaborators and participants may write to the chairman\nof the Trial Steering Committee regarding any worries\nthey may have about the trial. If concerns arise about side\neffects or particular types of participants, these will be\nrelayed to the Chairman of the DMC.\nIf clinically indicated, rapid unblinding of trial materials\nwill be available through the trial office.\nThe trial will be conducted according to the MRC Good\nClinical Practice Guidelines (1998), the Data Protection\nAct 1998, and the ICH E6 GCP document.\nPublication\nThe success of the trial depends entirely on the whole-\nhearted collaboration of a large number of participants,\ntheir relatives, nurses and doctors. For this reason, chief\ncredit for the trial will be given, not to the committees or\ncentral organisers, but to all those who have wholeheart-\nedly collaborated in the trial. The trial's publication policy\nis described in detail in section 2 of the Site File and is in\naccordance with the rules of the International Committee\nof Medical Journal Editors. The results of the trial will be\nreported first to trial collaborators. The main report will\nbe drafted by the Project Management Group, and circu-\nlated to all clinical co-ordinators for comment. The final\nversion will be agreed by the Trial Steering Committee\nbefore submission for publication, on behalf of the Col-\nlaboration. In this case the authorship will be presented\nby the collective title \u2013 The SIGNET Trial Group \u2013 and the\narticle will carry a footnote of the names of the people\n(and their institutions) represented by the corporate title.\nFor any additional publications (including conference\npresentations) one or more authors may take responsibil-\nity for drafting the paper or abstract but all group mem-\nbers qualify as members; in this case, this should be\nrecognised using the byline 'Jane Doe and the Trial\nGroup.' Group authorship may also be appropriate for\npublications where one or more authors take responsibil-\nity for a group, in which case the other group members are\nnot authors but may be listed in the acknowledgement\n(the byline would read 'Jane Doe for the Trial Group'). No\nstudy or report can be published without the agreement of\nthe Project Management Group.\nOnce the main report has been published, a summary will\nbe sent to the GPs of participants involved in the trial and\nto individual participants' or relatives' who have indicated\nthey would like to receive one.\nDiscussion\nIn 2002, the Medicines Control Agency provided exemp-\ntion letters for Selenase T pro injection (sodium selenite)\nsupplied by Oxford Nutrition and for Dipeptiven sup-\nplied by Fresenius-Kabi for this trial. Prior to the imple-\nmentation of the EU Directive in 2004, the MHRA\nconfirmed that the exemptions would be rolled over to a\nClinical Trial Authorisation.\nThe development of the protocol, ethical, research and\ndevelopment approvals had to negotiate the administra-\ntive constraints of the European Directive on Clinical Tri-\nals when applied to non-commercial trials.Page 11 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:25 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/25Efficient and economical provision of parenteral nutrition\nat recruiting centres required collaboration with a phar-\nmacy holding a license to compound the investigational\nmedicinal product. We are grateful to Tayside Pharmaceu-\nticals for their continued support and provision of 2\n\"base\" bags of blinded parenteral nutrition, one with\nglutamine and one without. The two PN base bags have a\n90 day stability. Thus, transportation and stock manage-\nment are vital to the trial success and in particular, mini-\nmisation of wastage. Participating pharmacy departments\nand the central supplier have access to a custom designed\nwebsite that has information on stock inventory, its shelf\nlife and site PN usage. When this is combined with a com-\nprehensive, refrigerated delivery service and an emergency\ncontract with a national courier, PN supply has become\nmore efficient.\nAddition of selenium and electrolytes by the individual\nparticipating pharmacies allows SIGNET centres to recruit\npatients with only a 5 day stock of 2 \"base\" bags of PN.\nDebate exists as to whether the addition of selenium at\neach centre constitutes a licensable action. Notably, sele-\nnium is one of the 2 Investigational Medicinal Products\n(IMPs) for this trial. A final decision is expected from\ncompetent authority in due course.\nTrial management is divided between Edinburgh where\nthe Chief Investigator and Trial Coordinator are based\nand Aberdeen University where the trial office is based (as\ndescribed above). The University of Edinburgh is admin-\nistering the MRC Grant. SIGNET is a multicentre trial and\nthe use of teleconferencing and the willingness of the cur-\nrent TrialCo-ordinator to travel has made the arrangement\nsuccessful.\nThe EU clinical trials directive requests that each trial must\nhave an identified sponsor. NHS Lothian is the lead NHS\norganisation and the Sponsor of the SIGNET trial with col-\nlaboration from the Centre for Healthcare Randomised\nTrials (CHaRT), within the University of Aberdeen.\nIncreasing investment in trial supporting infrastructure\nhas facilitated trial monitoring and documentation for\nsite monitoring and source document verification. Phar-\nmacovigilance is managed by Aberdeen University as the\ntrial office has infrastructure and procedures in place for\nreporting Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reac-\ntions (SUSARs).\nThe study is being conducted throughout Scotland and\ninvolves patients in intensive care and high dependency\nunits. The collaboration and support of the staff in the\nCritical Care areas is essential in running this study. There\nare currently 10 sites in Scotland recruiting patients and to\ndate over 285 patients have been recruited.\nAbbreviations\nSIGNET Scottish Intensive care Glutamine or seleNium\nEvaluative Trial\nPN Parenteral Nutrition\nEN Enteral Nutrition\nEU European Union\nICU Intensive Care Unit\nCCU Critical Care Unit\nUK United Kingdom\nDept Department\nRCT Randomised Controlled Trial\nCI Confidence Interval\nRR Relative Risk\nLFTs Liver Function Tests\nNHS National Health Service\nAPACHE Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evalua-\ntion\nSOFA Sequential Organ failure Assessment\ng gram\n\u00b5g microgram\nkcal kilocalorie\nml millilitres\nKg kilogram\nSF-12 Short Form 12\nEQ-5D Euoquol 5D [29]\nISD Information and Statistics Division (Scotland)\nONS National Office of Statistics\nGP General Practitioner\nSSAR Suspected Serious Adverse ReactionPage 12 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTrials 2007, 8:25 http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/8\/1\/25SUSAR Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions\nQALYs quality adjusted life years\nSICS Scottish Intensive Care Society\nChaRT Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trial\nGCP Good clinical practise\nLREC Local research ethics committee\nREC Research ethics committee\nCRF Case report form\nSOP Standard operating procedure\nMHRA Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory\nAgency\nDMC Data monitoring committee\nTSC Trial steering committee\nMRC Medical Research Council\nCompeting interests\nPeter JD Andrews (Chief Investigator), Alison Avenell,\nClaire Battison, Marion K Campbell, Bernard L Croal,\nAnne C Milne, David Noble, John Norrie, William G\nSimpson, Luke D Vale, Jonathon Cook & Robyn de Ver-\nteuil \u2013 The authors declare that they have no competing\ninterests.\nAuthors' contributions\nDN, AA, PJDA, MC, LV, BC, WS conceived the study, par-\nticipated in its design and drafted the manuscript.
