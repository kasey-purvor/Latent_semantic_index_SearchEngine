Scholars in international relations have long known that ideas matter in matters\nof international politics, yet theories of the discipline have failed to capture their impact\neither in the making of foreign policy or the nature of the international system. Recent\nreengagement with the insights of classical realists has pointed to the possibility of a\nneoclassical realist approach that can take into account the impact of ideas. This article will\nsuggest that the study of grand strategy can enlighten the intervening ideational variables\nbetween the distribution of power in the international system and the foreign policy\nbehaviour of states, and thus constitute the key element in a neoclassical realist research\nagenda.\nIntroduction\nThe term \u2018neoclassical realism\u2019, was coined by Gideon Rose in a 1998 World\nPolitics review article, which argued that neoclassical realism\nexplicitly incorporates both external and internal variables, updating and systematizing\ncertain insights drawn from classical realist thought. Its adherents argue that the scope and\nambition of a country\u2019s foreign policy is driven first and foremost by its place in the\ninternational system and specifically by its relative material power capabilities. This is why\nthey are realist. They argue further, however, that the impact of such power capabilities on\nforeign policy is indirect and complex, because systemic pressures must be translated\nthrough intervening variables at the unit level. This is why they are neoclassical.1\n1 Gideon Rose, \u2018Neoclassical Realism and Theories of Foreign Policy\u2019, World Politics, 51:1 (1998).\nThe best current overview of neoclassical realism is Jeffrey W. Taliaferro, Steven E. Lobell, and\nNorrin M Ripsman, Neoclassical Realism, the State and Foreign Policy (Cambridge University Press,\n2009). Examples of neoclassical realist works include Thomas J.

In many cases the neo- prefix indicates a work of classical realism done again,\na revival of that particular brand of approach to diplomatic history that had been\nconsigned to a footnote in IR textbooks by the promise of a clean, predictive social\nscience offered by realism\u2019s structural progeny.\nWhat makes neoclassical realist theory \u2018new\u2019 is its ongoing attempt to\nsystematise the wide and varied insights of classical realists within parsimonious\ntheory, or to put it in reverse, to identify the appropriate intervening variables that\ncan imbue realism\u2019s structural variant with a greater explanatory richness. In this\nsense, \u2018post-structural realism\u2019 could be as apt a designation for this area of IR that\nvalues theory and seeks at least some kind of predictive capacity, while at the same\ntime recognising that the world is complex, and that events in international politics\nreflect the interaction of multifarious factors.2 The task for neoclassical realism has\nbeen to attempt to integrate the \u2018rich but scattered ideas and untested assertions of\nearly realist works\u2019 within a more systemic theoretical structure.3 Whilst \u2018there is\nno evidence, and it is hard to imagine that any might exist, that any remotely\nrespectable Realist does not understand that policy is the outcome of a complex\npolitical process,\u20194 the challenge for neoclassical realist explanations is to emphasise\nstructural factors whilst allowing for their mediation through domestic political\nprocesses, to \u2018move beyond the relatively spare world of neorealist theory and\nincorporate unit-level factors as well.\u20195 In this endeavour, neoclassical realists are\nprepared to examine questions of innenpolitik, those \u2018first and second-image\nvariables\u2019 including domestic politics, state power and processes, leaders\u2019 percep-\ntions and the impact of ideas to explain how states react to the international\nenvironment.6 In line with its realist heritage however, such variables are\nconsidered analytically subordinate to systemic factors, the limits and opportunities\nof which states cannot escape in the long run. However, to understand how states\nrespond to an attempt to shape their external environment, IR scholars need to\nanalyse how system pressures are translated through intervening unit-level vari-\nables.7\nStephen Walt complains that neoclassical realism\u2019s particular suitability (and\ntendency) towards the construction of historical narratives means that the\ndiscipline\u2019s \u2018open-minded eclecticism is also its chief limitation [. . .] where\nneorealism sacrificed precision in order to gain parsimony and generality,\nneoclassical realism has given up generality and predictive power in an attempt to\ngain descriptive accuracy and policy relevance.\u20198 It is true that to date \u2018neoclassical\n2 Brian Rathbun, \u2018A Rose by Any Other Name: Neoclassical Realism as the Logical and Necessary\nExtension of Structural Realism\u2019, Security Studies, 17:2 (2008).\n3 Randall L.

Furthermore, the range of\nintervening unit-level variables that neoclassical realists have been prepared to\nconsider have varied with the historical case in hand.9\nThis article is an attempt to establish a common intervening variable \u2013 the role\nof strategic ideas \u2013 which can describe how the structural pressures of power in the\ninternational system are translated into foreign policy outcomes by states. It\nproceeds by first establishing the scope of grand strategy, neoclassical realism\u2019s\nobject of study. It then assesses the failure of neorealism and social constructivism\nto integrate both ideational and material factors, and highlights how classical\nrealists were prepared to admit the impact of both, before introducing a positivist\nconception that shows how ideas may operate at the unit level within states. A\nneoclassical realist model of grand strategy is then proposed and the implications\nof the approach drawn out.\nGrand strategy\nIn order for a theoretical approach to be both rigorous and parsimonious, it needs\nto be clear about exactly what the insights of the approach should be applied to;\nthat is to say, what is being analysed using the tools of theory? Neoclassical\nrealism, an approach which combines elements of system, structure and domestic\npolitics, of material and ideational factors, needs to analyse international relations\nfrom a plural perspective. Like many of the key notions of International Relations,\n\u2018grand strategy\u2019 is both commonly used and instinctively understood, yet at the\nsame time the concept evades unanimous agreement as to its precise meaning.\nIndeed, it often appears that there are as many differing definitions as there are\nauthors on the subject, each incorporating for their own purposes various\nnuances.10 What follows is a brief overview of the historical progress of the\nconcept, from which we may derive some general insights about the nature of\ngrand strategy and its suitability as the object of analysis for neoclassical realism.\nStatesmen have always used certain principles to guide their actions in the\nuncertain and anarchic world of the international system, developing identities and\npostures for their nations in often violent competition with others. These strategies,\nrather than setting out day-to-day operational matters, governed the overall course\nto which those operations were directed. The early history of strategy is therefore\nconcerned solely with military campaigns, and was distinguished by Clausewitz\nfrom tactics, which \u2018is the art of using troops in battle; strategy is the art of using\nbattles to win the war\u2019.11\n9 The plethora of intervening variables addressed by neoclassical realist is detailed in Taliaferro,\nLobell, and Ripsman, Neoclassical Realism, the State and Foreign Policy, pp. 1\u201341. The authors\nargue that there is no single neoclassical realist theory of foreign policy, but rather a diversity of\nneoclassical realist theories.\n10 Dueck, Reluctant Crusaders, pp. 9\u201310.\n11 Carl von Clausewitz, Michael Eliot Howard and Peter Paret, On War (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 1976), pp. 127\u201332.\nSystemic pressures and domestic ideas 119\nYet just as international politics is not solely about waging war, strategy is not\njust the art of winning wars, but is a more complex and multilayered undertak-\ning.12 Grand strategy therefore encompasses not only military means and ends, but\nthe means and ends of politics, economics and ideology, in short all the aspects of\npower and influence at a nation\u2019s \u2013 and therefore, a statesman\u2019s \u2013 disposal.13\nFollowing Basil Liddel Hart\u2019s observation that since \u2018the object in war is a better\nstate of peace [. . .] it is essential to conduct war with constant regard to the peace\nyou desire\u2019, grand strategy required assessment and consideration of the political\ncontext both before and during conflict.14 To be successful, grand strategy\ntherefore needed to integrate \u2018the politics and armaments of the nation that resort\nto war is either rendered unnecessary or is undertaken with the maximum chance\nof victory.\u201915\nGrand strategy was therefore to involve \u2018the evolution and integration of\npolicies that should operate for decades, or even centuries\u2019 in order to balance\nmeans and ends both in peacetime and wartime. Such a broad remit for grand\nstrategy required it to take into consideration factors as diverse as managing\nnational resources; diplomacy; national morale and political culture.16\nThe crux of grand strategy lies therefore in policy, that is, in the capacity of the nation\u2019s\nleaders to bring together all of the elements, both military and non-military, for the\npreservation and enhancement of the nation\u2019s long-term (that is, in wartime and peacetime)\nbest interests.\u201917\nThe extension of the concept reflected a trend in IR more generally that\ncondemned neorealism\u2019s definition of security as too narrow and its characteris-\nation of those elements of power with which security could be achieved as too\ncapabilities-centred. Since realist thought, by focusing on the systemic level, \u2018tended\nto neglect patterns of domestic support and economic strength that might affect\nlong term commitment to a deterrent, containment, or balance of power strategy\u2019,\nthe theoretical understanding of grand strategy needed to be modified to take\naccount of those factors.18\nInevitably, some realist authors countered that if the concept was to retain its\nanalytical usefulness, it needed to focus on specific threats to the survival of the\nstate and the military means to counter them.19 Yet in the post-Cold War world\nit had become clear that both the range of threats and interests and the variety of\nstrategic tools used to meet them were far broader than such restrictive definitions.\nIndeed, realist accounts focused solely on what Posen instead described as military\n12 Paul M.

Traditional realism\u2019s narrow focus on military threats,\nhard power and systemic imperatives failed to understand the extent to which a\nstate\u2019s grand strategy represents \u2018a political-military means-ends chain, a state\u2019s\ntheory about how it can best \u201ccause\u201d security for itself.\u201920\nGrand strategy is therefore the level at which systemic and unit level factors\nconverge, where matters of national security are mediated through public diplo-\nmacy.21 When we speak of grand strategy as an analytical concept, we are speaking\nof that considered set of national policies in peace and war that both set out the\ngoals of the state in international politics and prescribe how a broad range of\nnational resources should be utilised in pursuit of those goals. The study of grand\nstrategy is therefore the study of states\u2019 attitudes to the international environment\n\u2013 of how they mobilise which elements of their power in pursuit of which causes\nin global politics. It is in this way that grand strategy may fulfil neoclassical\nrealists\u2019 requirement for a coherent analytical subject that integrates both the\nsystemic realist elements and the domestic level factors that neoclassical realists\nhave revived from classical insights. How neoclassical realism should understand\nthe role of ideas within the process of grand strategy formation is therefore the\nfocus of the next sections.\nTheorising ideas: the reductionism of neorealism and social constructivism\nNeorealist theory or structural realism attributes security competition to the\nabsence of any overarching authority in the international system. For neorealists,\ninternational politics consists of \u2018like units\u2019 \u2013 states \u2013 duplicating one another\u2019s\nactivities \u2013 their functional similarity rendering variations between states at the unit\nlevel irrelevant to explaining the international outcomes of interaction between\nthem. It is solely the nature and structure of the system within which those units\ncoexist that determines their behaviour and mediates outcomes.22 Dismissing\n\u2018ideology, form of government, peacefulness, bellicosity or whatever\u2019, what makes\ninternational relations tick is nothing more than the \u2018distribution of capabilities\u2019.23\nSuch a rigid identification of state motivation with the material national interest\ncoincided neatly with the apparently zero-sum nature of Cold War bipolarity.\nIndeed, the logic of this pure form of realism is so highly determined that it entails\nthat policy choice can only ever arise in two scenarios. First, in situations where\ncalculations of particular considerations balance equally, presenting alternatives\nwith identical impacts on the security of the state, in which case the choice is\narbitrary; and second where imperfect information creates gaps in the assessment\n20 Barry Posen, The Sources of Military Doctrine: France, Britain, and Germany between the World\nWars, Cornell Studies in Security Affairs (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1984), p. 7.\n21 Ben D. Mor, \u2018Public Diplomacy in Grand Strategy\u2019, Foreign Policy Analysis, 2:2 (2006), pp. 158\u20139.\n22 Security Dilemma\u2019 World Politics, 30:2 (1978); John J. Mearsheimer, The Tragedy of Great Power\nPolitics (New York, London: W.W. Norton, 2001).\n23 Waltz, Theory of International Politics, p. 98.\nSystemic pressures and domestic ideas 121\nof the national interest which are filled by competing sets of conjecture and\nsupposition, in which case the choice is unwelcome, being a function of ignorance\nrather than knowledge.\nRealism\u2019s approach to historical anomalies in which ideas seemed to override\nstrategic interest in decision-making was to dismiss these cases as outliers which\ncould be accounted for by their failure to account with the rational actor model.24\nHowever, this type of analysis begs the question. At what point do actors cease to\nbe non-rational, and just start being different? The danger is that rational action\nis defined as political realism, so that foreign policy that does not conform to\nrealist tenets is a priori non-rational. Realism can\u2019t explain ideological foreign\npolicy because it is not realism.\nMoreover, neorealism\u2019s attitude towards the force of ideas is condemned by\naspects of the self-image of the doctrine itself, which \u2018contains not only a\ntheoretical but also a normative element [. . .] [it] considers a rational foreign policy\nto be a good foreign policy [. . .] [it] wants the photographic picture of the political\nworld to resemble as much as possible its painted portrait.\u201925 Realism then, is both\nan explanatory theory and a normative theory. The ideas contained within realism\nnot only explain international politics, but should also inform the decision-making\nof policymakers.\nThe paradox of neorealism\u2019s treatment of ideas is that as an explanatory theory\ncannot account for the normative influence of its own doctrine on the actions of\nstates. This is the crux of Krasner\u2019s complaint that social scientists were offering\npolicy advice to decision-makers \u2018when there was nothing in their theories that\nwould [lead them to believe they could] do any good\u2019.26 If ideas are merely for\nrhetorical purposes, then why urge statesmen to adhere to the ideas of realism? If,\non the other hand, the ideas contained in realism\u2019s foreign policy prescriptions can\nshape the world so that it more perfectly resembles the theoretical image, how can\nthose ideas be dismissed as lacking the power to affect international affairs? Thus\nthe explicit expression of a normative element in realism necessarily undermines its\nexplanatory power so long as the influence of ideas is denied.\nAn alternative structural approach suffered the same difficulty in reverse. Social\nconstructivism discards the rationalist, materialist philosophical assumptions of\ninternational relations altogether to conclude that the very meaning of power and\nthe content of interests are functions of ideas.27 Although this approach has been\nuseful in establishing the importance of identities alongside interests in establishing\ndurable expectations of behaviour between states,28 the epistemological basis of the\nconstructivist approach is a form of structural idealism or \u2018idea-ism\u2019 that stands in\ndirect opposition to the core claims of realism and many of the most basic\n24 On US foreign policy\u2019s \u2018non-logical\u2019 character see Stephen D.

Wendt\u2019s claim that when IR\nscholars explain \u2018state action by reference to interests, they are actually explaining\nit by reference to a certain kind of idea\u2019 appears to deny that there are empirically\nknowable material facts per se. Similarly, if material interests are actually explained\nby ideas, it is difficult to comprehend exactly how \u201cthe true \u2018material base\u2019 can still\nhave independent effects\u2019.31 If, as constructivism contends, ideas are \u2018inextricably\ninvolved in the production of interests\u201932 it is futile to distinguish between the two.\nSo although constructivism can help us understand that identities, norms and\nrules are endogenous to system structure, in doing so the distribution of material\ncapabilities is regarded as an essentially exogenous factor. Where neorealism states\nthat ideas don\u2019t matter, constructivism tells us that material capabilities aren\u2019t\nimportant. The unavoidable conclusion is that where structural realism reduced\nideas to interests, social constructivism reduces interests to ideas. Neither can\ncapture the sense in which both ideas and interests play roles \u2013 sometimes\ncompeting, sometimes complementary \u2013 in formulating the direction of states\u2019\nforeign policy and the structure of the international system.\nClassical realism\nThat classical realism was less constrained by the epistemological rigidities that\ncharacterise neorealism and social constructivism accounts for both its explanatory\nstrengths and theoretical weaknesses. Whilst prioritising power, classical realists\nadmitted a role for ideas alongside material considerations. First and foremost a\nphilosophical position, modern variants of realist theory can trace their lineage\nfrom the writings of Thucydides through to Hobbes and Machiavelli. This\nphilosophy is pessimistic about the human condition, rejects teleological notions of\npolitical progress and regards ethics and morality as products of power. From its\nassessment of humans in the state of nature realism identifies competition for\nresources among tribal groups as the most basic feature of social organisation,\nwhich is therefore defined by the facts of power.33 Classical realists therefore build\nupon the foundations of this attitude towards human nature to derive a set of\nprinciples about the nature of international politics, to argue that \u2018politics, like\nsociety in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in human\n29 Alexander Wendt, \u2018Collective Identity Formation and the International State\u2019 American Political\nScience Review, 88:2 (1994), pp. 385.

The\nclearest statements of modern realism\u2019s attitude to human nature are Hans J. Morgenthau, Scientific\nMan Vs. Power Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1946); Kenneth Waltz, Man, the\nState, and War: A Theoretical Analysis (New York: Columbia University Press, 1959).\nSystemic pressures and domestic ideas 123\nnature.\u201934 The state in the international system is analogous to man in the state of\nnature; thus international politics is most fundamentally about power, which is\naccrued, defended and wielded only in pursuit of the national interest defined as\nnational security, the nature of which can be identified and assessed in terms of\nmaterial capabilities. The international system has no sovereign and is therefore\nanarchic, and so state action within it can be reduced to the national interest: thus\nthe security of the nation-state is the sole determinant of foreign policy.35\nClassical realist works are therefore not in any sense congested with enthusiastic\nchampioning of the ability of ideas to shape international politics. Indeed, the\noriginal title for EH Carr\u2019s Twenty Years Crisis was Utopia and Reality, and Carr\u2019s\nproject was to demolish the notion that international politics could be subjugated\nto the force of human reason.36 Yet at the same time classical realists see realism\nas a necessary corrective to the dangerous naivety of idealism, not as a replacement\nfor it; indeed classical realists cautioned statesmen to abide by the more stable\nmaxims of power because they realised that ideas and culture could have \u2018a\nprofound effect on the strategic behaviour of states.\u201937\nAt the individual level, Morgenthau identifies ideas as sources of change, since\n\u2018when people see things in a new light, they may act in a new way.\u201938 Indeed,\nMorgenthau\u2019s Aristotelian conception of human agency and his emphasis on both\nthe virtue of prudence and diplomacy suggests a more complex picture of the role\nof ideas in international politics than he is often credited with having held.39\nPolitics Among Nations offers numerous examples of states with incongruous\npolitical power and material capabilities, a gap deriving from the abilities of their\nleaders, for whom the strategies and tactics used to convert the potential attributes\npower into influence are as important as the attributes themselves.40 The role of the\nstatesmen was therefore to mitigate the more turbulent forces of anarchy through\nwise leadership, to moderate power and pursue peace. As Morgenthau writes,\ndiplomacy is the instrument of peace through accommodation:\n34 Hans J. Morgenthau, W. David Clinton, and Kenneth W. Thompson, Politics among Nations: The\nStruggle for Power and Peace (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 4.

All the other factors which determine\nnational power are, as it were, the raw material out of which the power of a nation is\nfashioned. The quality of a nation\u2019s diplomacy combines those different factors into an\nintegrated whole, gives them direction and weight, and awakens their slumbering\npotentialities by giving them the breadth of actual power. The conduct of a nation\u2019s foreign\naffairs by its diplomats is for national power in peace what military strategy and tactics are\nfor national power in war. It is the art of bringing the different elements of the national\npower to bear with the maximum effect upon those points in the international situation\nthat concern that national interest most directly.41\nEH Carr too, saw that rhetoric, \u2018the art of persuasion\u2019, has always been \u2018part of\nthe equipment of a political leader\u2019 in mobilising the minds of men alongside the\nmaterial elements of military and economic might.42 Carr therefore offers the hope\nthat not only is \u2018there is something which man ought to think and do, but that\nthere is something which he can think and do, and that his thought and action are\nneither mechanical nor meaningless.\u201943 Carr sees a role for ideas at the domestic\nlevel in the use of propaganda and the education of the nation: \u2018the state which\nprovides the education necessarily determines its content. No state will allow its\nfuture citizens to imbibe in its schools teaching subversive of the principles on\nwhich it is based.\u201944 Ideas, classical realists knew, are powerful things, and power\nover them is one of the greatest assets a state can procure for itself. Indeed, the\nbasic moral ideas that statesmen themselves hold precludes them from even\nconsidering certain means and ends, a process which could \u2018tame\u2019 the national\ninterest and moderate self-interest and conflict.45 Morgenthau therefore argues that\nbeyond the irreducible minimum of the survival of the state, statesmen would take\ninto account the cultural and moral ideas of their people to pursue goals which\ncould \u2018run the whole gamut of objectives any nation has ever pursued or might\npossibly pursue.\u201946\nCarr\u2019s analysis that the most influential ideas have been based on professedly\nuniversal principles also allows that ideas may operate at the international level,\nmoving across borders as tools or effects of foreign policy, but only successfully\nwhen backed in some way by national political power.47 In addition, Carr identifies\na \u2018general sense of obligation\u2019, a norm that operates between states, thus rendering\ntreaties and agreements useful elements of international politics.48 Similarly, both\nKissinger and Morgenthau grant a role to the generation of legitimacy, and wrote\napprovingly of the international society of the European royal families, whose\naristocratic ideals moderated competition.49 So conceptions of justice do matter in\ninternational politics, and the production of peaceful change in that arena involves\na compromise between utopian ideas of common right and realist adjustments to\n41 Morgenthau, Clinton, and Thompson, Politics among Nations, p. 152.

Michael Williams has attempted to emphasise the impact of ideas\nwithin Morgenthau\u2019s writings, with particular focus on the role of ideas in identity\nformation and the construction of the national interest.58 Similarly, Smith notes\nthat how a statesman \u2018defines the national interest depends on the values he\nespouses and the way he ranks them.\u201959 Yet Williams stretches the point when he\nregards the role of ideas in classical realist thought as \u2018crucial\u2019.60 Morgenthau\nrepeatedly argued against the \u2018sentimental illusion\u2019 that America\u2019s Cold War\n50 Carr and Cox, The Twenty Years\u2019 Crisis, pp. 199\u2013202.\n51 Hans J.

Neoclassical realism thus places the impact of ideas\nalongside the imperatives of material power in the making of foreign policy,\nrejecting the notion that either ideas or material factors are somehow \u2018most\nfundamental\u2019 and therefore deserving of analytic focus to the exclusion of the\nother.64 However, both the definitional status and conceptual implications of the\nterm \u2018idea\u2019 are, to put it mildly, the subject of some debate. To date, no single\ndefinition has emerged, nor is there agreement on the causal roles ideas play in\npolitical processes.65 Unfortunately, in much of the literature the necessity of clear\ndefinition is either ignored and the assumption of definitional transparency\nerroneously made; or the term is confusingly equated and used interchangeably\nwith, variously, \u2018belief\u2019, \u2018ideology\u2019, \u2018theory\u2019, \u2018models\u2019, \u2018schools of thought\u2019 and even\n\u2018intellectual idiosyncrasies\u2019.66 In order to integrate ideas into a neoclassical\napproach that focuses on grand strategy we need to construct a positivist approach\nthat is both clear about how it defines its terms and rigorous about the accuracy\nof their application.\nFirst, and contrary to what some have suggested, it is important that ideas and\ninterests are maintained as conceptually distinct phenomena.67 Although many\nRealism, and the Moral Construction of Power Politics\u2019 International Organization, 58: 3 (2004),\np. 634.\n61 William E.

There is no logical impediment to\nour holding ideas that directly contradict our interests, and that therefore the two\nshould remain conceptually distinct.68 Against Waltz\u2019s assertion that Neoclassical\nrealists require that interests, in contrast to ideas, are those things that we can\nknow as material facts about the world and which constitute power relations\nbetween states. They are those things that a state must secure if it is to maintain\nits place in the balance-of-power.\nThe idea that there is an independent reality directly available to state officials\nand analysts is not an uncontroversial one. It has been suggested that even the\nidentification of a state\u2019s material interests is a process that requires \u2018significant\ninterpretive labour\u2019.69 Certainly there is something to this criticism, yet even were\nthis always the case, and it is by no means clear that it is, we should not derive\nthe conclusion that material interests are unknowable, that the concept is not a\nuseful one. Instead we should seek to isolate the material from the ideational, to\nidentify how particular ideas provide context within which states\u2019 pursue their\nparamount objective of securing those things they identify as key material interests.\nThe second mistake that rationalist approaches have tended to make to date is\nthat they identify ideas with beliefs, a definition that confuses far more than it\nclarifies.70 The same authors that define ideas as \u2018beliefs held by individuals\u2019 claim\nthat \u2018ideas can have an impact even when no one genuinely believes in them.\u201971\nSuch thinking invites the criticism that for this to be the case, \u2018ideas\u2019 must be\ndistinct from the \u2018beliefs\u2019 without which they can still have impact.72 This critique\nerroneously assumes that for something to be a belief, at least someone needs to\nbelieve in it. This is transparently not the case. To say that one does not believe\nx is to say that one does believe x\u2019s negation. Yet it makes little sense to say, even\non the basis of universal disbelief, that a statement is not a belief but its negation\nis. Despite the failure of this critique however, the shared belief characterisation is\nfundamentally weakened by the fact that by defining ideas as beliefs we remove\ntheir power. A rationalist approach to ideas envisages ideas as having force\nalongside material interests, but by defining ideas as mere beliefs it becomes\ndifficult to see them as (effective) weapons in policy debates.73\nInsisting on the distinctions between ideas and interests on the one hand and\nideas and beliefs on the other does not however entail that each may not interact\n\u2018variation in policy across countries, or over time, is entirely accounted for by changes in factors\nother than ideas\u2019 with their belief that \u2018ideas and interests are not phenomenologically separate\u2019.

Ideas may fill gaps in policymakers\u2019 knowledge of\ninterests.74 Ideas can establish the framework within which interests are pursued\nand resolve uncertainty about how to pursue them. Thus, for Weber, \u2018not ideas,\nbut material and ideal interests, directly govern men\u2019s conduct. Yet very frequently\nthe \u201cworld images\u201d that have been created by ideas have, like switchmen,\ndetermined the tracks along which action has been pushed by the dynamic of\ninterest.\u201975 Similarly, Goldstein and Keohane\u2019s \u2018typology of belief\u2019 provides us with\nan indication of how individuals\u2019 worldviews and ethical ideas may prioritise\ncertain ideas over others or lead them to particular ideas.76\nPhenomenological separation of ideas, beliefs and interests allows us to isolate\nthree very specific types of ideas involved in policy formulation. The first, scientific\nideas, tell us about how the world works. Scientific ideas establish the relations\nbetween things in the international environment. Examples might include the\nstopping power of water, or the idea that liberal democracies will not go to war\nwith each other. These ideas establish the boundaries of possibility for state\nstrategies by describing and interpreting the relations of empirical realities in the\ninternational system.\nSecond, what one might call intentional ideas, are normative suggestions that\nseek to establish goals for foreign policy. These types of ideas reflect ethical\nprejudices on the part of their proponents. They articulate in the realm of foreign\npolicy what the nation should seek to do, simply because it is the right thing to\ndo. For example, a state may seek to use its foreign policy to advance the cause\nof human rights. It should be noted that this is not the same as it being in that\nstate\u2019s interests to promote human rights. Whilst intentional ideas that run counter\nto the national interest are less likely to gain support among either elites,\nbureaucracies or the national public, there is nothing inherent in the concept that\nsays that they may not \u2013 the separation of ideas and interests renders this a\ncontingent rather than logical relation. So rather than seeing, for example, financial\naid to impoverished countries in terms of powerful countries wielding economic\npower for their own ends, or alternatively as part of a process that constitutes the\nsocial identities of rich and poor countries, a neoclassical realist approach allows\nus to view aid as an intentional idea translated into policy because it is simply\nconsidered by a state\u2019s foreign policy executive as the right thing to do.\nThird are what one might call operational ideas. These may be scientific or\nnormative statements that recommend the means by which a certain end should be\npursued. As in the case of intentional ideas they may be based on ethical\njudgements, but they more often arise from the holding of a particular causal belief\nabout how which policies produce which outcomes. A neoclassical realist account\nmight therefore explain the differing approaches of states towards similar threat by\nreference to differing operational ideas as much as differing coercive capabilities.\nApart from creating a typology of what ideas are, the other question that\nneoclassical realism must address if it is to properly integrate ideas is how ideas\n74 Marks, The Formation of European Policy in Post-Franco Spain, p. 28.\n75 Max Weber, \u2018The Social Psychology of the World Religions\u2019 in H. H. Gerth and C. Wright Mills\n(eds), From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology (London: Routledge, 1948), p. 280.\n76 Goldstein and Keohane, \u2018Ideas and Foreign Policy\u2019 pp. 8\u201310.\nSystemic pressures and domestic ideas 129\nwork in the process of foreign policy to mediate structural pressures. Why are some\nideas adopted as policy where others founder? What precipitates changes in\nprevailing ideas?\nThe intervening variable: ideas within nations\nA neoclassical realist approach might usefully require that ideas are treated as\nobjects with force, that is, as elements of power. However, it should be obvious\nthat the relationship between ideas and power is rather different from the\nrelationship between, say, money and power, or military hardware and power.\nWhereas material capabilities\u2019 power is largely intrinsic and fixed, the power of an\nidea is both dependent and variable. Therefore I suggest locations at which ideas\nmay intervene at the unit level: through the specific individuals that hold them;\nthrough institutions in which they may become embedded; and through the\nbroader culture of the state.\nFundamentally the state is made up of individuals. Individuals construct\nsystems, institutions and bureaucracies; individuals lead and follow; individuals\nmake decisions. On what basis do individuals decide which ideas to hold? The first\nis the quality of the idea itself \u2013 its internal coherence, its congruence with known\nrealities. The second key to success resides in the speaker himself \u2013 his intellectual\nstatus, his eloquence of advocacy. Thus the power of an idea to persuade others\nat any one moment in history resides both in itself, and in the power of those who\nhold it. The causal effect of ideas on policies has tended to be displaced onto the\npolitical effects of individuals in IR theory, so that the persuasiveness of ideas is\nassumed rather than examined, and treated as constant.77 It is however, important\nto recognise that some ideas are \u2018better\u2019 than others, and are more likely to\nprogress into the policymaking arena, where institutional factors may then come\ninto play.\nThis is not to deny the crucial role of forces exogenous to them that push\ncertain ideas to heart of policymaking. Whilst the degree to which ideas generate\npopular support may provide them with power mediated through public opinion,\nideas can take a shortcut to policy success if they have the backing of individuals\nand institutions that themselves have power. The character of these \u2018couriers\u2019 of\nideas that may be as important, if not more so, than anything intrinsic to the idea\nitself.78 At the individual level then, neoclassical realism understands that the ideas\nheld by powerful actors within the state matter. Whilst the intrinsic power of a\nparticular idea makes its progress into such positions more likely, the ideas that\nwill impact most upon foreign policy are those held by those in decision-making\npositions in the state and those who directly advise them. Thus as Mead notes, \u2018It\n77 Albert S. Yee, \u2018The Causal Effects of Ideas on Policies\u2019 International Organization, 50:1 (1996), p.\n86.

If Theodore Roosevelt and not Woodrow Wilson had\nbeen President when World War I broke out, American and world history might\nhave taken a very different turn.\u201979\nThe second location at which ideas may impact at the unit level occurs when\nindividuals with shared ideas coalesce into groups, organisations, and common\npractices within the state to form institutions that operate in both formal and\ninformal sectors of the policymaking process. The formation of institutions reflects\nthe fact that ideas that are somehow embedded in particular structures are\npossessed of greater power. Institutions can act as couriers for ideas in three\nways.80 \u2018Epistemic communities\u2019 of experts have the policy-relevant knowledge to\nexert influence on the positions adopted by a wide range of actors. The extent of\nthe influence of such groups is dependent on their ability to occupy influential\npositions within bureaucracies from where they may consolidate their power,\nthereby institutionalising the influence of the community.81 However, their ability\nto infiltrate bureaucratic posts will depend \u2013 at least in part \u2013 on the receptiveness\nof the existing bureaucratic order to their ideas.82\nA second means by which institutions act as couriers is by the encasing of ideas\nin formal rules and procedures at the creation of the institution itself. Once they\nhave become embedded in this way, those ideas with which the institution was\nfounded can continue to influence policy even though the interests or ideas of their\ncreators may have changed. Thus, \u2018when institutions intervene, the impact of ideas\ncan be prolonged for decades or even generations.\u201983\nIn both of these ways, \u2018ideas acquire force when they find organizational means\nof expression\u2019.84 The third way in which ideas can impact is through the structural\narrangements institutions create. These structures set up road-blocks and through-\nroutes which determine the ease with which ideas can gain access to the policy\nprocess. Indeed, the structure of the institutional framework may determine the\npolitical and administrative \u2018viability\u2019 of particular ideas, that is, their ability to\nappeal to current conditions. Institutional structure therefore ensures that policy-\nmakers only have access to a limited set of ideas, whether those are percolated up\nto them or searched for by them.85 In this way, the ideas that form what some refer\nto as \u2018strategic culture\u2019 may provide a reliable guide to a state\u2019s likely reaction to\nshifts in the structure of the international system.86\nUnderlying both individuals and institutions are the ideas contained in the\nbroader cultural context within which the state is located. Ideas that are embedded\nin social norms, patterns of discourse and collective identities become accepted,\n\u2018instinctual\u2019 parts of the social world and are experienced as part of a natural\n79 Walter Russell Mead, Power, Terror, Peace, and War: America\u2019s Grand Strategy in a World at Risk,\n1st ed.

Randall Schweller has been prominent\nin identifying the constraints that domestic political processes impose on states that\ncause them to \u2018underbalance\u2019 in the face of external threats.94 Schweller\u2019s\nargument, although arguably more sophisticated, is similar to Zakaria\u2019s concept of\n\u2018state power\u2019 and Taliaferro\u2019s resource extraction model, in that they focus on the\nway in which domestic political processes affect the ability of the state to act in\ninternational politics.95 The implication of these types of account is that states with\nsimilar internal bureaucratic structures will address similar threats in similar ways.\nA theory of ideas however, whilst incorporating these insights about the character\nof domestic politics, focuses on how prevailing ideas influence the type of foreign\npolicy response to structural imperatives. It can therefore explain how similarly\nstructured states may respond in different ways to similar threats by reference to\ndiffering prevailing ideas within the state, whether that be as a result of the\nparticular individuals advocating the ideas, broader cultural preferences, national\n87 Sheri Berman, \u2018Ideas, Norms and Culture in Political Analysis\u2019 Comparative Politics, 33:2 (2001), pp.\n238\u20139.\n88 Dueck, \u2018New Perspectives\u2019 p. 215.\n89 Michael C.

The response as understood through the prism of ideas can\nthen account for both overreaction and underreaction, as well as for the pursuit of\ngoals unrelated to the notion of threat.\nA neoclassical realist model of grand strategy formation\nWe have now set out both the scope of grand strategy and the way neoclassical\nrealism should conceptualise the role of ideas in policymaking. What follows is an\nanalysis of the making of grand strategy. How does grand strategy operate? What\u2019s\ninvolved in the process of its formulation? What determines the outcome of that\nprocess? Why does it change? These questions and the answers to them may serve\nto constitute the beginnings of a defined, systematic neoclassical realist approach\nthat views states\u2019 grand strategies as its primary analysis and is able to specify the\ndomestic ideational variables that intervene between system structure and foreign\npolicy outcomes.\nGrand strategy involves a number of processes that take place within states,\n\u2018defined as the central decision-making institutions and roles [that] can be treated\nas unified actors pursuing aims understood in terms of the national interest.\u201996\nNeoclassical realists do admit that the identities and scope of those central\ndecision-making actors depends on the specific characteristics of a country\u2019s\npolitical system, but retains a \u2018top-down\u2019 conception of the state in which systemic\nforces are mediated by a national security or foreign policy executive.97 That\nexecutive may however be influenced in their thinking by the cumulative actions of\nactors as diverse as policy makers, lobbyists, citizens\u2019 groups and businesses, and\nby the process of bargaining with them.98 Thus \u2018leaders define the \u2018national\ninterests\u2019 and conduct foreign policy based on their assessment of relative power\nand other states\u2019 intentions, but always subject to domestic constraints.\u201999 By using\na plural definition of the state neoclassical realism recognises that processes within\nstates are influenced not only by exogenous systemic factors and considerations of\npower and security, but also by cultural and ideological bias, domestic political\nconsiderations and prevailing ideas.\n96 Krasner, Defending the National Interest, pp. 12\u20133. This definition can be developed by disaggre-\ngating the democratic \u2018state\u2019 into two elements, the representative (legislative) element and the\nforeign policy executive (composed of high-ranking bureaucrats and elected executive officials\ncharged with the overall conduct of foreign affairs). Strategy derives from the balance of the\nnecessary tensions between the societal pressure of the representative element which acts in the\ninterests of society, and the strategic pressures of the executive which acts in the interests for society.\nDavid A.

It will\ntherefore come into play even in the most simple pattern of balance of power; that is, when\none nation opposes another. This uncertainty is, however, immeasurably magnified when\n[the balance of power] is composed not of single units but of alliances.104\nThus uncertainty deriving from imperfect intelligence and the machinations of\nstructure, plus the sheer volume of information involved, may create an imbalance\nbetween complexity and the analytic capacity of individuals involved in strategic\nplanning.105 Such an imbalance creates a void that can only be filled by the\nscientific ideas held by decision-makers, so that \u2018the greater the ambiguity, the\ngreater the impact of preconceptions.\u2019106 Having said all that, it should be clear\nthat many features of the international system can be known with a satisfactory\ndegree of certainty, and therefore a consensus on a strategic assessment is more\nlikely to derive from clear facts than any collective cognitive bias. Still, it remains\nimportant to recognise that ideas may intervene to fill the knowledge gaps between\nthe actual strategic situation and the conclusions of a strategic assessment.107\nA consideration of the empirical facts of the balance of power is not on its own\nenough to identify a threat to a state.108 Threats come to be identified on the basis\n100 Posen, The Sources of Military Doctrine, p. 13.\n101 Dueck, Reluctant Crusaders; Layne, The Peace of Illusions; Rose, \u2019Neoclassical Realism\u2019.\n102 Steven E.

Morgenthau specified three\n\u2018typical errors of evaluation\u2019: 1) disregarding the relativity of power by regarding the power of one\nparticular nation as absolute; 2) assuming permanency of a certain factor of power when in fact most\nare subject to dynamic change; and 3) attributing to a single factor decisive importance.

More profoundly, particular scientific or intentional ideas may consider\nsome features of individual states or of the international system itself as simply\nthreatening per se, even in the absence of targeted capability or intent.110\nThe means of strategy \u2013 power and appropriateness\nThe second element in the formulation of grand strategy is the selection of means\nto address identified threats. This process involves consideration of both what\nmeans are available, which will work most effectively, and whether their use can\nbe justified. States have a choice of means with which they may pursue strategic\ngoals, and access to differing aspects of power which they can mobilise against\nthreats, from the soft power of cultural norms to the hard power of military\ncoercion.111\nActors within states may hold competing operational ideas about which means\nare most appropriate to address particular threats. For example, within militaries\nthe different forces tend to hold competing ideas about the effectiveness of their\nrespective methods. Elsewhere within the state, some actors may consider that\nparticular goals require the use of economic sanctions and military \u2018sticks\u2019, whereas\nother actors prefer to rely on the \u2018carrots\u2019 of trade and softer elements of power.\nNot only do actors hold different ideas about which means will work, there exists\na competition of ideas concerning which means are ethically acceptable. Corre-\nspondingly, actors will have different ideas about which means are appropriate,\nwhich may reflect both long-standing cultural factors and prevailing domestic\npolitical attitudes. Should condom distribution or abstinence programs form the\nbasis of aid to address HIV epidemics? Are sanctions justifiable if they hurt the\npeople as well as their despotic government?\n109 Ibid., pp. 12\u20133. Henry Nau goes further, to plausibly argue that power can only really threaten when\nnational identities diverge, and that we should can therefore usefully think of the international\nsystem in terms of a \u2018distribution of identity\u2019, alongside the distribution of power. Henry R. Nau,\nAt Home Abroad: Identity and Power in American Foreign Policy, Cornell Studies in Political\nEconomy (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2002).\n110 For example, internal instability may be seen as a threat (UN Resolution 1556 describes genocide\nin Darfur as \u2018a threat to international peace and security\u2019). Some argue that dictatorships,\nirrespective of their particular character, are necessarily threatening. Robert D. Kaplan, \u2018Old States,\nNew Threats, Washington Post (23 April 2006).\n111 Walter Russell Mead disaggregates this spectrum to isolate four tools of strategy: \u2018sharp power\u2019,\n\u2018sticky power\u2019, \u2018sweet power\u2019 and \u2018hegmonic power\u2019. See Mead, Power Terror Peace and War, pp.\n26\u201358.\nSystemic pressures and domestic ideas 135\nAuxiliary goals \u2013 strategy beyond the national interest\nOnce threats have been identified, ranked and the means to address them decided,\nthe third, tertiary element of grand strategy identifies auxiliary goals and selects the\nappropriate means to attain them. In an anarchic system with uncertainty of\nintentions, the primary purpose of the state is to ensure its own survival using the\nresources available to it. Therefore the scope of a state\u2019s auxiliary goals will be\nconstrained by the availability of resources, and so some states in the system may\nnot have auxiliary goals at all, preferring instead to engage all their available\nresources in the pursuit of security. On the other hand, some states may not have\nenough resources to provide for security and, considering the attempt fruitless, may\ntherefore instead devote the resources they have entirely towards auxiliary goals.\nStrong states have excess resources that will allow them to both guarantee their\nsecurity and pursue auxiliary international goals. Auxiliary goals may be expan-\nsionist in terms of territory or economic power; they may create interests for a state\nbased on historic or cultural ties; they may seek to further ethical concerns or\npolitical ideas; they may be directed towards \u2018global\u2019 interests. The choice of which\nauxiliary goals to pursue and with which resources to pursue them will always be\nthe result of ideational debate within the state, since systemic imperatives have\nalready been addressed in one form or another.\nIt could be countered that any free resources are illusory, as security needs\ngrow with states\u2019 disposable power. However, in order for power to be disposable\nit must by definition be a free resource. The logic of this critique is that at all times\nthe resources of a state are equal to or less than that state\u2019s security requirements,\nwhich seems empirically dubious. Rather than new threats instantaneously\nappearing to occupy resources as states expand it seems more likely that states use\n\u2018national security\u2019 rhetoric as a justification for auxiliary goals selected for those\nincreased capabilities.\nAs this section has shown, grand strategy emerges through these processes of\nempirical assessment and ideational competition within the state. Although in most\ncases the primary requirement is for security from threats, placing a systemic\nanalysis of the distribution of power at the heart of grand-strategic decision-\nmaking, grand strategy involves much more than simply the identification of, and\nresponse to, threats. At the heart of the process, strategic ideas provide\npolicymakers with guidance in conditions of uncertainty, reflecting the considerable\nautonomy and scope for creativity on the part of the state to use ideas to shape\ngrand strategy in response to external pressures.112\nThe conceptual framework of neorealism can therefore only have a constrain-\ning, rather than determining, effect on grand strategic outcomes. Conversely, the\ninsights of neoclassical realism fit well with a process of grand strategy formation\nthat is plural, constrained by systemic imperatives and yet determined by ideational\nfactors at unit level. Neoclassical realism allows us to understand the choices made\nbetween the wide range of grand-strategic options that typically remain following\nthe strategic assessment, choices that are determined by the ideas and positions of\nindividuals and groups that comprise the state.\n112 Colin Dueck, \u2018Ideas and Alternatives in American Grand Strategy, 2000\u20132004\u2019 Review of\nInternational Studies, 30 (2004), pp. 521\u201323.\n136 Nicholas Kitchen\nAccounting for grand strategic change\nNeoclassical realism therefore points us towards the processes by which grand\nstrategy comes to be made. However, it is equally important to be able to trace\nhow shifting factors affect strategic thinking, and to understand what is sufficient\nfor that to be significant, that is to say, what is required for grand strategy to\nchange? How and why does strategic adjustment take place?\nThe first question here is what constitutes \u2018change\u2019. Efforts to create typologies\nof strategy have had mixed success. Although we may recognise and contrast\n\u2018expansionist\u2019 and \u2018status quo\u2019 strategies;113 or \u2018compellent\u2019, \u2018deterrent\u2019 and\n\u2018accomodationist\u2019 strategies,114 it seems unlikely that states\u2019 grand strategies fit\nneatly into these few typologies, or that significant change in grand strategy would\nnecessarily be reflected by a move from one typology to another.\nRather than seeking to identify strategic adjustment in terms of moves from\none defined typology to another, Dueck has suggested that we measure change by\nreference to the policy instruments typically associated with strategic decision-\nmaking. Thus we should look for shifts in areas such as military deployments and\nspending; alliance commitments; foreign aid; and willingness to commit to\ndiplomatic initiatives, as well as considering the overall tone of a state\u2019s stance\ntowards its adversaries and the international system in general.115\nOf course, minor alterations of policy need not indicate strategic adjustment.\nStrategy is idealised in nature, and contingencies and compromises will impel\nminor changes in foreign policy as a state is faced with the realities of international\npolitics and picks where and when to fight its battles. Dueck therefore rightly\nidentifies that \u2018tinkering\u2019 takes place within a strategic approach without consti-\ntuting strategic adjustment. He identifies two levels of strategic adjustment \u2013\nfirst-order changes entail a \u2018massive shift in the extent of strategic commitments\u2019\nand second-order changes are \u2018less fundamental\u2019.116 Dueck rightly points us in the\ndirection of policy instruments as our variable factors, and we might look for\nrhetorical shifts to indicate whether a shift is \u2018massive\u2019 or \u2018less fundamental\u2019. So\nwhilst foreign policy tinkering will be justified by both the pre-existing ends in sight\nand the means to achieve them, strategic adjustment means a shift in the goals\nand\/or the methods of the state in international relations.\nThus we might propose that a first-order change should involve a significant\nshift in the goals of the state, that is, the identification of a new threat; a change\nin the ranking of serious threats; or the addition or removal of a significant\n113 Edward Luttwak, Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace, Rev. and enl. ed. (Cambridge, Mass.:\nBelknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2001), p. 182. The author mistakenly excludes the\npossibility of declinist grand strategies, perhaps because of an underlying assumption that strategy\nrefers to a state\u2019s purposeful interactions with others, rendering a minimally activist strategy almost\na contradiction in terms.

It may also involve, though need not involve, a shift in the means\nused to pursue those goals. By contrast, a second-order change should involve only\na significant shift in the primary means by which to pursue existing goals, that is\nto say, a shift from a focus on one form of power to another.\nIt is noted that this distinction may be over-simplistic, and that it is by no\nmeans certain that first order changes will have greater systemic impact than\nsecond order changes. A state which moves from a grand strategy of democratic\nenlargement by economic and diplomatic means to the same strategy achieved\nthrough the use of military force will clearly have a greater impact on the\ngrand-strategic reactions of others than a state that gives up an auxiliary goal that\nwas supported by little power. If one were able to specify the relation between\ndifferent elements of power in terms of their coercive impact, one could rank the\ngoals of the state in terms of the power allocated to them and so better specify the\nimpact of a grand strategic shift. But for our purposes here it is enough to\ndistinguish between shifts in goals and shifts in means.\nWhat factors can account for a grand strategic change in ends or means on the\npart of a state? The neorealist position focuses on shifts in international system,\nthat is, shifts in national security doctrine stem from shifts in the international\ndistribution of power that alter the state\u2019s relative position.117 Patterns of strategic\nadjustment are determined by structural pressures at the systemic level, and the\npressure of competition is such that states become \u2018undifferentiated\u2019 in their\nstrategic behaviour.118 However, neorealist approaches are unspecific regarding the\ncausal processes that turn systemic change into unit-level strategic shifts. Unless the\ninternational environment is especially highly constrained, that is, external threats\nto national interests and values are particularly high; it is difficult to deduce\nsecurity postures directly from the balance of material capabilities.119\nWaltz himself admits that \u2018in the absence of counterweights, a country\u2019s\ninternal impulses prevail\u2019.120 The neoclassical realist position takes that admission\nfurther, arguing that variables at the unit-level \u2013 in the ideas and perceptions of\nactors within the state \u2013 play a \u2018pivotal\u2019 role in the selection of a grand strategy.121\nThus grand strategic change can result from shifts at either the unit or the systemic\nlevel. Since the most important element in international relations remains the\nbalance of power between states, changes in the international distribution of power\nencourage strategic adjustment. At the same time, it is essential to understand the\nnature of the states in that balance of power in order to understand the structure\nof relations between them. States do not necessarily regard power as threatening;\nit is the combination of power and nature that defines enmity in the international\nenvironment. It is shifts in the level of external threat that are the most likely cause\nof strategic adjustment.122\nOf secondary importance, the introduction of intervening ideational variables\nmeans that neoclassical realism is able to account for grand strategic change in an\n117 Emily O.

These shifts may occur within the state, or in the wider\npopulous.123 Shifts in personnel, institutional power, or the popularity of particular\nideas may precipitate changes in goals or encourage reassessment of the means by\nwhich to pursue them. Such shifts may be driven from the bottom up, by electoral\nresults or by the use of bureaucratic leverage; or from the top down, in the form\nof the executive\u2019s power of patronage and final decision.\nWhither realism?\nA neoclassical realist theory that recognises ideas as the key intervening variable\nbetween the pressures of system structure and the resulting grand strategy of states\nboth has predictive capacity and the ability to provide rigorous historical\nexplanations. However, a critical tension exists in the approach: in admitting that\nideas can have genuine impact, how is that a genuinely realist approach? Indeed,\nif the ideas in question reject realism, how can a realist theory account for them:\nwould it not be better to simply say that realism tells us little about state behaviour\nin these situations?124\nWhilst it might be argued that this argument rests on an overly narrow\nunderstanding of realism that doesn\u2019t reflect its intellectual history, this is more\nthan a semantic criticism about what we call \u2018realism\u2019 and what we don\u2019t.125 There\nare essentially two critiques here: first, how does neoclassical realism account for\nand understand contra-realist ideas; and second, in what sense does the theory\nremain distinctly realist. In the first case, it should be remembered that this is a\ndescriptive theory and not a prescriptive one \u2013 it does not suggest a course of\naction on the part of states, rather it accepts that different states will react to the\ninternational environment in different ways because of the different ideas in play\nwithin the state itself. It therefore need not, and does not, deny that contra-realist\nideas exist, and that they may be in play within states.\nIn principle then, this neoclassical realist theory does not deny that a state\nmight place such at ideas at the very heart of its policymaking and so choose to\npursue a contra-realist grand strategy. However, it does contend that the likelihood\nof that strategy being either maintained or successfully implemented is exception-\nally unlikely. Because system structure is the preeminent variable, a state would\nrequire a near-monopoly of power in the international system to pursue a grand\nstrategy that went against its interests as defined by that structure. In such a\nsituation, the very structure of the system would be defined by a single unit that\nused its power in pursuit of particular contra-realist ideas. The closest potential\nexample in the Westphalian era would be the United States\u2019 institutionalisation of\n123 For example, Peter Trubowitz argues that significant American strategic adjustment coincided with\nand grew out of shifts in the underlying regional structure of political and economic power within\nthe United States.

Contra-realist ideas are likely to be confined to\nthe margins of strategy, either as poorly resourced auxiliary goals or as sops to\nlegitimise more realist means and ends, standing ready to be jettisoned when the\nsystem starts to bite.\nThe second issue is the extent to which a theory that admits to even just the\nlogical possibility of contra-realist outcomes can be considered realist. Yet the ideas\nthat might produce such outcomes are very much secondary variables in the\ntheory. Systemic and material factors remain the primary determinants of grand\nstrategy, and the realist tools of material power the preeminent modes of action in\ninternational politics. Indeed, we can identify a number of core realist principles to\nwhich this argument subscribes.\nFirst, the state is the most appropriate unit of analysis in international\nrelations. Whilst the definition of the state represented here is somewhat looser\nthan some earlier realist work, the central organising principle remains that of\nhumans arranging themselves into self-interested political groups whose primary\naim is the survival of that group. Second, the nature of the international system is\nanarchic. Even though states take the edge off anarchy through institution-\nbuilding, fundamentally their relations revolve around the competition for scarce\nresources in the absence of an external arbiter of disputes. Third, power is the\nessential tool that those states have at their disposal in that competition, and the\nmost effective types of power are material capabilities.127\nWhere the neoclassical approach departs from neorealist theories \u2013 but not\nfrom classical approaches \u2013 is that it does not posit a direct logical connection\nbetween the nature of the system and the way states will behave. Instead that\nconnection is indirect, mediated through the ideas present in grand strategy\nselection. What states identify as their security interests and goals of strategy is\ndetermined by the nature of their analysis of the structure of the system and the\npower of the ideas that are present in the policymaking process. It is because\nneoclassical realism relies on knowledge of both the material structure of the\ninternational system and the ideational situation within the state that it is equipped\nto illuminate when and why relations between states will deviate from bald\nneorealist theory; but that does not mean that its outcomes are somehow\nnon-realist, it is just that they will form richer explanations and more specific\npredictions.\n126 G.

It\nprioritises and stresses \u2018power, interests and coalition making as the central\nelements in a theory of politics\u2019 but seeks to recapture classical realists\u2019\nappreciation that we need to look within societies as well as between them, to deny\nthat states are simple, \u2018irreducible atoms whose power and interests are to be\nassessed.\u2019128 Understanding how and when ideas may intervene in the unit-level\nprocesses of grand strategy formation allows us to posit three hypothetical\nscenarios where states are likely to be more influenced by their ideas than their\ninterests in the international environment.\nFirst, states that are very powerful are the most likely to pursue ideas-based\npolicies. We see this in the tendency of great powers with a surfeit of material\ncapabilities to attempt visionary world-making. With their territorial and political\nintegrity secured, interests offer few constraints to check the progress of grand\nideas in the policymaking process, and the international system poses few\nconstraints on a state whose material power and ideational dominance largely\ndefines international structure. The question \u2018what must we do?\u2019 is replaced by\n\u2018what shall we do?\u2019 Hegemonic or imperial states therefore have power that can be\nused for objectives that are not associated with clearly definable needs, and in such\nsituations, a foreign policy based on intentional ideas is the likely course, in which\nideological goals become ends in themselves.129 As Jeffrey Legro notes, \u2018great\npower ideas matter because they guide foreign policy and are a building block of\ninternational life\u2019 and when they change they do so with \u2018earthquake-like effects\u2019\nthat make as well as unmake the prevailing international order.130 A neoclassical\nrealist theory of the role of ideas in grand strategy understands that the more\npower is centralised within the international system, the more we should expect the\ngrand strategy of the dominant states to be defined by their strategic ideas, and can\naccount for the fact that those great power strategies may change for internal as\nwell as external reasons.\nThe second scenario involves states where particular ideas are highly institu-\ntionalised or culturally embedded. In this scenario the impact of ideas is likely to\nbe strong and consistent throughout the policy process. Ideas that form a strong\ncomponent of national identity or strategic culture are likely to be almost\nunconsciously shared among ruling elites and foreign policy institutions. These\nideas filter and limit options, ruling out policies that fail to resonate with the\nnational political culture.131\nThird, in states where decision-making power is highly concentrated in one, or\na few individuals, or in a particular institution in which particular ideas are\nembedded, the rationality of numbers does not have a chance to operate, and so\n128 Jack L.

It is this that accounts for the unpredictability of dictatorial regimes.132\nFurthermore, neoclassical realism as a structural theory provides us with a\nnumber of insights about the composition of the international system. In this sense\nneoclassical realism can be viewed as a logical extension of neorealism.133 First,\nneoclassical realism should be able to recognise that most of what are described by\nrealists as system changes are actually shifts in the grand strategies of the units that\nmake up that system. The balance of the system itself is made up of, in the main,\nthe alignments of the grand strategies of states: not a balance of power by itself,\nbut a balance of power and posture, a balance of goals and the means that have\nbeen placed in pursuit of them. A purely structural realist explanation cannot offer\na comprehensive account of why a state\u2019s capabilities may decline in relation to a\nstrategic competitor.134 To do so, we must take into account both the grand-\nstrategic choices of the state, and the strength of the state, that is its ability to bring\nthose choices to bear.135\nIt follows that neoclassical realism considers the occurrence of structural change\nthat is unrelated to one or more states\u2019 grand-strategic behaviour to be very rare.\nImportant change can of course derive from long term changes in geography,\nresource availability and the availability of technology.136 But such change is\nsystemic rather than structural, in that it defines the rules by which interaction\ntakes place. Most structural change should actually be understood as a reflection\nof a grand-strategic choice by one or more states that changes the pattern of\ninteraction between them. Although neorealist theory defines a system as composed\nof structure and of interacting units, as Barry Buzan has pointed out, Waltz\u2019s\nemphatic distinction between unit-level theories and systemic theories \u2018and his\nusage of terms such as \u201csystems theory\u201d and \u201csystems level\u201d makes the term system\neffectively a synonym for structure.\u2019137 Neoclassical realism, on the other hand,\nrecognises as classical realism did before it that the international system is\ncomposed of units, their interactions, and structure. The system has structure, but\nthe system defines structure only in as much as its logic informs the interactions\nof states that constitute structure. Interaction, therefore, \u2018is crucial to the concept\nof system, for without it, the term system has no meaning\u2019.138\nSince the structure of the system creates constraints for states\u2019 grand strategies,\nthen in a very fundamental way, states\u2019 grand strategies and the international\nsystem are mutually constituted. The nature of the units and the character of their\n132 Gaddis, We Now Know, p. 291.\n133 Rathbun, \u2018A Rose by Any Other Name: Neoclassical Realism as the Logical and Necessary\nExtension of Structural Realism\u2019.\n134 William C.

Similarly, Zakiria defines state power as the government\u2019s ability to put national\nresources to the ends of its choice. Therefore, societies with weak states are unable to exploit their\nresources fully, so that only strong states can successfully pursue expansionist grand strategies.\nZakaria, From Wealth to Power, pp. 38\u20139.\n136 For example, Goldman notes that air power, nuclear weapons and the information age have all\nreduced the \u2018space\u2019 between states, effectively altering the nature of their environment.

Jones, and Richard Little, The Logic of Anarchy: Neorealism to Structural\nRealism, New Directions in World Politics (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993), p. 28.\n138 Ibid., p. 29.\n142 Nicholas Kitchen\ninteractions both create and are informed by structure. That is to say, the structure\nthat informs and constrains states\u2019 grand strategic choices is itself constituted by\nthe grand strategic choices of states.\nThus, in this vision of the international system, and true to the primacy\nneoclassical realism places on the imperatives of power, the most important states\nremain those that have the greatest resources or that hold the balance of power.\nHowever, it is not only the amount of power resources that determines structure,\nbut the purpose to which the strongest states put their resources. Thus by reviving\nclassical realism\u2019s insights about the state, neoclassical realism is better able to\nexplain first and second order changes in grand strategy that are not wholly derived\nfrom a shift in international structure.\nThe recognition of intervening ideational variables in neoclassical realism is\nparticularly important when considering their impact on the strongest states. Since\nthe interaction of states\u2019 grand strategies constitutes structure, the grand strategic\nchoices of the strongest states are crucial to an understanding of the international\nsystem at any given moment. A neoclassical realist approach is all the more\nappropriate given that the strongest states have the greatest degree of strategic\nchoice because they possess more power than is required to meet their basic\nsecurity requirements. Looking inside the strongest states to understand the\nmechanisms driving their choices of auxiliary goals is necessary to provide a proper\nunderstanding of the nature of the international system itself.\nTo date, most neoclassical realist approaches have attempted to explain\ndeviations from the expectations of structural realism with reference to the limited\nauthority of the state to conduct foreign policy.139 An approach that assesses the\nrole of ideas at the unit level in grand strategy formation explains why states\nchoose to act in ways which structural realism would not expect. Neoclassical\nrealism then has the potential to defuse a number of key areas of conflict in the\nstudy of international relations. Whilst it is a positivist theory, it does not secure\nits rationalism on a rejection of immaterial factors such as ideas, instead it attempts\nto incorporate them, giving them weight as material factors have weight, and\nunderstanding the interaction between the two within the individuals and institu-\ntions that combine them. With a focus on grand strategy, neoclassical realist\nanalysis can provide important insights about the nature of international structure\nand how processes both endogenous and exogenous to states can change it.\nFor neoclassical realists then, the international system is not the determining\nmonolith that neorealism envisioned, a vision coloured by the admittedly highly\nrestrictive bipolarity of the Cold War. Rather, neoclassical realists regard the\nstructure of the international system as providing states with information about the\ncosts and benefits of particular courses of action, but how that information is\nprocessed and weighed depends on the way states understand the world, their\npreferences, their ideas and their ethics. It is in this sense that neoclassical realism\nresuscitates the \u2018political\u2019 element of political realism, and in doing so revives the\nrole of realism in fulfilling Morgenthau\u2019s dictum that the role of political scientists\nis to \u2018speak truth to power\u2019.140\n139 Taliaferro, Lobell, and Ripsman, Neoclassical Realism, the State and Foreign Policy, p. 281.\n140 Morgenthau, Science: Servant or Master?, p. 15.\nSystemic pressures and domestic ideas 143\n"}
