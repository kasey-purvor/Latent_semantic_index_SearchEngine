INTRODUCTION \nSeveral challenges must be addressed to achieve efficient \nvideo delivery over cellular networks. Perhaps the most \nsignificant problem is the effect of time-varying, high-error, \nthroughput-limited channel conditions experienced by mobile \nusers. To keep performance at an acceptable level, a \ncommunication system is traditionally designed for an average \nor worst-case scenario. However, with worst-case design, the \nsystem is severely under-utilized when the channel is in good \nstate. For average case design, poor CIR leads to high variance \nin video quality and periods of unacceptably poor video output. \nSuch schemes do not provide acceptable quality for all users \n[I]. An alternative method for limiting the effects of time- \nvarying channel conditions is to employ power control \ntechniques [2]. However, these techniques have a tendency to \nreduce the overall system capacity due to an increase in \ninterference power to other users. \nAn alternative to the above is link adaptation. This \ninvolves the modification of modulation and coding levels in \nresponse to the instantaneous channel and interference \nconditions. Usually, for best-effort data services, link \nadaptation algorithms are designed to maximize the overall \nnetwork throughput [3]. The design of link adaptation \nalgorithms for multimedia services should optimize the \nS.N. Fabri \nNEC Technologies (UK) Ltd \nERDC, The Imperium (Level 3), Imperial Way, \nReading, Berkshire, RG2 OTD, UK. \nSimon.fabri@nectech.co.uk \ndelivery of acceptable video quality, facilitating good quality \nvideo services with minimum demand on network resources. \nAppropriate design of link adaptation algorithms has been \nshown to result in improved perceptual quality for one-to-one \nconversational services compared to non-adaptive schemes [4]. \nIn this paper, a method of applying a link adaptation technique \nto streaming (one-to-many) services is proposed. To achieve \nlink adaptation, the algorithm should ideally be able to switch \nbetween a number of source coding rates without performing \ncustom encoding for each user. One way to do this would be to \nuse scalable coding [5]. However, scalable coding tends to be \nmuch less compression efficient than a single stream, and is \ntherefore not very efficient in low bit rate channels. Therefore, \nto improve the efficiency of the link adaptation, the scheme \nproposed in this paper switches between pre-encoded streams \nstored at the server. No extra user interaction is required and \nthe link adaptation algorithm is transparent to the end user. \nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 11 gives a brief \ndescription of the enabling technologies. The proposed link \nadaptation algorithm is presented in Section 111. In Section IV, \nthe simulation set up is described. The algorithm performance \nis investigated and the performance comparisons are presented \nin Section V. Finally, Section VI contains the conclusions. \n11. EGPRS NETWORKS AND THE MPEG-4 VIDEO CODEC \nA. EGPRS System Architecture \nFig. 1 shows how the EGPRS packet-switched system \narchitecture is modified for this proposal. The most important \nservice entities for streaming are the content server and the \nstreaming client, which together with the EGPRS core network \nentities ensure correct media delivery to the user. Link quality \nand QoS profile storage is the element that must be added to \nthe system to provide link adaptation. It stores the most current \nmeasurements provided by the BSC (Base Station Controller), \nregarding the time-vruying radio link. In addition, it stores hand \nover and requested QoS parameters for each individual user. \nThis recorded information can be used by a link adaptation \nalgorithm. \nAdaptation can be performed by switching between the \ndifferent EGPRS modulation-coding schemes (see Table I). \n0-7803-8255-2\/04\/$20.00 OXO4 IEEE. 2763 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

MPEG-4Video Codec \nMPEG-4 is a video-coding standard designed for low bit- \nrate applications. It provides a number of error resilience tools, \nwhich are designed to mitigate errors when operating over \nerror-prone environments such as mobile links and IP-based \nnetworks [7]. These tools provide various properties such as \nerror isolation, error resilience, error concealment and data \nrecovely, in order to make the video codec more resilient to \nchannel degradations. \nTemporal error propagation may he limited by periodically \ninserting \u201cIntra\u201d frames. Intra frames do not make use of any \ninformation from other frames. These are normally used as \nrefresh frames to clear up errors that may have been \npropagating through the decoded video sequence. However, \nIntra frames are much larger than predictively-coded Inter \nframes, leading to large spikes in throughput, which can result \nin frame dropping by rate-limitation algorithms. The software \ndeveloped by the authors makes use of the Adaptive Intra \nRefresh (AIR) technique described in Annex E.1.5 of the \nMPEG-4 standard [7]. This forces the insertion o f a  preset \nnumber of non-predictive Intra blocks into each frame. The \nIntra blocks limit the propagation of errors through successive \nframes, similarly to Intra frames. But they also remove the \nneed for Intra frame transmission, resulting in much smoother \nthroughput. \nIll. STREAM SWITCHED LINK ADAPTATION \nThe proposed Link Adaptation Algorithm (LAA) is \ndesigned to improve video quality by varying the source rate \nand the channel-coding scheme according to measured channel \ncondition, while using a fixed number of EGPRS Time Slots \n(TS\u2019s). This means that although the source rate is allowed to \nvary, the allocated resources across the radio link do not \nchange. Throughput across the radio interface varies according \nto the modulation-coding scheme used. This section describes \nhow streams can be switched at the server, and how the link \nadaptation algorithm operates. Its design is based on the \nfollowing principles and assumptions: \nReceived video quality increases with source rate in \nan error-free environment. \nAs the CIR increases, the received video quality \napproaches a maximum limit for a given source rate \nregardless of the channel-coding scheme being used \n[I 11. \nA. Stream Switching \nThe most obvious way of providing different source rates for \neach user would be to use scalability. However, this is \ninefficient in terms of compression. An alternative is to encode \n\u201con-the-fly\u2019\u2019 for each user, which requires significant \ncomputation, and does not scale easily. The approach proposed \nhere involves the use of pre-stored streams on the server. \n0-7803-8255-21wrs20.00 IEE. 2764 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

When \nswitching is performed between streams, there is a mismatch \nbetween the encoder and decoder in terms of the reference \nframes used to predict future frames. This can potentially lead \nto drift [PI. However, the AIR technique limits the effects, and \nprevents it bccoming a detectable problem. \nB. Link Adaptation Algorithm \n6. If there are more video frames to be transmitted, \nretum to step 2. \nC .  Meamremen1 of Channel Conditions \nA link adaptation algorithm needs an accurate and recent \nestimation of the quality of the radio channel. The two main \nradio link measurements, upon which a channel estimation \nalgorithm is to rely on, are the Received Signal Strength (RSS) \nand BLock Error Rate (BLER) indicator. Since the RSS is a \nmeasure of the total received power, including the noise and \ninterference power, channel quality estimation based on RSS is \nnot very accurate. The systems that rely on the BLER \nmeasurements give reasonably accurate channel estimation, \nalthough the accuracy is limited by the error detection \nproperties of the channel-protection scheme that is used. \nA further concem is the round trip delay. If this delay is too \nhigh, the estimated channel condition based on feedback \nmeasurements is of little use. In addition to the BLER and \nRSS, our proposed algorithm uses the first order statistics of \nthe RSS profile in the prediction of channel condition. \nM x N number of buffers are allocated for each video \nsequence ill the Content is the \"Iber Of \nTime-Slots in a radio frame (8 for EGPRS) and M is the \nChannel estimation is performed by first partitioning a \nrange of possible BLER measurements into a finite number of \nintervals.

As \ncan be seen from Table II ,  for selected TS,;,  .there are M \ndifferent video source rates (corresponding to different MCS \nschemes), which can be applied.

This is because thd BLER flag is set if the \nradio block is found to be in error after channel decoding. \nTherefore, highly protective channel coding schemes such as \nMCS-I, which uses a GMSK modulation and 112 rate \nconvolutional coding, provide lower BLER than other schemes \nfor the same channel condition. This means that the BLER \nthreshold values should be dependant upon the channel-coding \nscheme used. Measured BLER is averaged over N radio blocks \nin order to reduce the effect of burst errors on the channel \nestimation. Thus, the calculated BLER to be used in the \nchannel estimation algorithm is: \nwhere BL,,l,j is the calculated block error rate. BLp,meus,j is \nthe measured block error rate in krhradio block.

Feedback Technique \nThe feedback channel is used to cany measured channel \ninformation, RSS and BLER. Measured RSS is quantized with \n8-bits uniform quantization, which provides a resolution of 0.5 \ndB. The measured BLER is represented by either zero or one. \nThe total 9 bits for each quantized sample is transmitted over \nthe mobile link using a selected modulation-coding scheme. \nThe total information rate on the feedback channel is around \n450 bitsis. This is very low compared with the forward user \ndata rate of 28 - 60 kbits\/s. \nIV. SIMULATIONS \nThe GSMiGERAN mobile radio multi-path propagation \nmodel described in [6] is used to represent the propagation \nchannel. In addition to fast fading and multi-path \ncharacteristics, shadow fading with a lognormal variance of 7 \ndB, and a propagation path loss model were considered in the \ncalculation of the CIR ratio of the channel for different \nfrequency reuse patterns and frequency hopping strategies. \nStandard (ideal) hexagonal cells and perfect sectonsation are \nassumed (i.e. no electromagnetic wave penetration to other \nsectors). The parameters used in the implementation are listed \nin Table 111. \nThe locations of mobile terminals are uniformly distributed \nwithin the cell coverage area and their direction of travel is \nrandomly chosen at initialization. A pseudo-random mobility \nmodel with semi-directed trajectories is used to simulate the \nuser mobility. The terminal\u2019s position is updated according to \nthe de-correlation length and the direction is changed at each \nposition update with probability of 0.2. \nTABLE 111.

The CIR due to \nthe path loss and the shadowing process are simulated \nseparately. The total CIR was estimated by superimposing the \nsimulated shadowing process over the calculated CIR due to \npath loss. \nExperimental results have shown that only MCS-I, MCS-2 \nand MCS-5 are useful for video, as all of the other schemes \nresult in too high error rates at the decoder to yield acceptable \nquality [4]. In addition, MCS-I has a very low bit rate, making \nit impractical to use without allocating four or more time slots. \nTherefore, switching in this paper is limited to between MCS-2 \nand MCS-5, and testing id carried out with 3 time slots. The \nswitching threshold is 22.5 dB, which has been determined \nfrom a number of simulations [4]. \nEach video frame is considered as one transport and \nnetwork layer data payload unit in the EGPRS protocol \nimplementation, as the size of each video frame is below the \nspecified maximum LLC-PDU size (1520 octets) [9] for the bit \nrates considered. \nITU test sequences \u201cSuzie\u201d and \u201cForeman\u201d are used as the \nsource signals. QCIF (176 by 144 pixels) sequences are coded \nat I O  framesjsecond. To produce longer sequences (25 \nseconds), these sequences are repeated, with even numbered \nsequences played in reverse order to guarantee a smooth \ntransition. \nThe sequences are MPEG-4 coded using all of the error \nresilience options and with AIR enabled. Sequences are \ncompressed with different non-vqing  bit rate outputs using \nthe TM5 [IO] rate control algorithm. TMS varies the \nquantization to ensure a particular target rate and does not drop \nframes. To achieve the lower bit rates, it is necessary to reduce \nthe number of non-predictive AIR macro-blocks per frame. \nThis means that while I O  AIR MB\u2019s are used for MCS-5, only \n5 are used for MCS-2. \nV. RESULTS \nFig. 2 shows a comparison of the results for fixed coding \nand for the proposed link adaptation techniques. Performances \nare shown in terms of frame Peak Signal to Noise Ratio \n(PSNR) averaged over 3000 Games. Two different \nimplementation of link adaptation algorithm is considered. The \nfirst method uses the actual CIR value of the communication \nlink in stream switching and it is called CIR LAA. Accurate \ndetermination of the CIR is difficult in a practical system, so \nthe performance of CIR LAA scheme should be seen as ideal. \nThe second method uses BLER based measurement of channel \nquality, which is a more practical measurement method for \nimplementation. This is called BLER LAA. \n2766 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 19,2010 at 15:00:23 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Simulation results for BLER based LAA. \nI t  should be noted that the CIR value on the x-axis of the \ngraphs is the average CIR of a time varying channel. The \nresults clearly show that both LAA schemes outperform both \nof the fixed schemes over almost the entire CIR range. The \nresults also show that the performance of BLER LAA is only \nslightly lower than that of the ideal CIR LAA. LAA schemes \nimprove PSNR by more than 2dB for certain channel \nconditions. In addition, the minimum required CIR for \nacceptable quality video reception is improved by at least 2 dB, \nassuming 30 dB is acceptable for Suzie and 26 dB is acceptable \nfor Foreman. Acceptable quality PSNR is different for both \nsequences because of the differing levels of compression \ndistortion visible in the two sequences. \nAnother noticeable element of the results in Fig. 2 is the similar \nperformance of MCS-2 to MCS-5 at low average CIRs. This is \ndue to the lower error recovery properties of the MCS-2 bit \nstream: each frame contains fewer AIR blocks than in the \nMCS-5 sequence. \nThe BLER LAA described here uses channel prediction \nestimates to minimize the effects of delay on the link \nadaptation performance. Tests were conducted using a variety \nof delay values to evaluate the scheme\u2019s sensitivity to delay. It \nis found that the algorithm remains beneficial in the face of \ntypical EGPRS network delays. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS \nThe technique presented in this paper provides a delay robust \nlink adaptation mechanism for sending streaming video over \nEGPRS mobile networks. The proposed scheme uses the \nAdaptive Intra Refresh (AIR) technique in MPEG-4 to allow \nswitching between two pre-encoded hit streams, designed for \nuse with two different modulation-coding schemes. This \nremoves the need for encoder-decoder interaction normally \nassociated with link adaptation. By using a prediction method \nfor future channel conditions, the technique is also robust to \n2767 \ndelay in the feedback channel. Tests were performed using \nEGPRS channel models, comparing the results of fixed \nmodulation-coding scheme scenarios to two different link \nadaptation methods. One method uses CIR for determining \nwhen to switch, while the other uses BLER. The BLER \nmethod is the most practical to implement, and performs only \nslightly worse than the case using CIR. \nREFERENCES \n[ I ]  K. Chawea, 2. Jiang, X. Qiu, and A.
