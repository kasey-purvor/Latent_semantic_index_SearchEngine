INTRODUCTION\nFowler\u2013Nordheim \u0001FN\u0002 tunneling1 is electric-field-\ninduced tunneling through a roughly triangular barrier. When\nthe barrier to emission from a material into vacuum is\n\u201cstrong,\u201d in a sense defined below, there is a low-temperature\nelectron emission regime \u0001including room temperature\u0002\nknown as \u201ccold field electron emission \u0001CFE\u0002.\u201d FN tunneling\nand CFE are processes of significant technological interest,\nespecially in connection with the prevention of vacuum\nbreakdown, the development of cold-cathode electron\nsources, and internal electron transfer processes in some\ntypes of electronic device. A more careful formulation of the\ntheory would be helpful.\nCFE is usually described by one or other of a large fam-\nily of approximate equations, called Fowler\u2013Nordheim-type\n\u0001FN-type\u0002 equations. This paper is one of several by the\npresent author2\u20135 that aim to progressively consolidate exist-\ning theoretical treatments of CFE into a more complete and\ncoherent intellectual structure. It argues that a tunneling pref-\nactor should appear both in the expression derived for the\nprobability D of tunneling through any particular defined\nbarrier, and in the FN-type equations derived by summing\ncontributions to the emission current density \u0001ECD\u0002 made by\ntunneling from all internal electronic states. Inclusion of the\nprefactor should eventually enable tunneling probabilities\nand current densities to be calculated slightly more consis-\ntently. However, more important, it helps make the theory\nphysically more complete. The need to include this prefactor\nwas briefly discussed elsewhere,5 as part of a wider discus-\nsion of correction factors. This paper presents detailed justi-\nfication.\nThe following basic notation is used. Let e denote the\nelementary positive charge, me the electron mass in free\nspace, \u00010 the electric constant, hP Planck\u2019s constant \u0001with\n\u0002P=hP \/2\u0003\u0002, and \u0004 the local work function of the emitting\nsurface. The field at the emitter surface, which determines\nthe tunneling barrier, is denoted by F and called the \u201cbarrier\nfield;\u201d the ECD is denoted by J. In CFE theory, these\npositive quantities are the negative of the like-named quan-\ntities used in conventional electrostatics. The symbols\na\u0003\u0005e3 \/8\u0003hP\u0004 and b\u0003\u0005\u00018\u0003 \/3\u0002\u00012me\u00021\/2 \/ehP\u0004 denote the first\nand second FN constants.4\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. Section II pro-\nvides theoretical background. Section III reviews barriers\nwhere the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved exactly to give\nan expression for D and shows that \u0001except for the parabolic\nbarrier\u0002 a tunneling prefactor is always present. Section IV\nre-examines Standard CFE theory in the light of this finding.\nSection V looks at the consequences of including this pref-\nactor in the derivation of FN-type equations. Section VI\nnotes other CFE contexts where a tunneling prefactor is\nneeded. Section VII provides summary and conclusions.\nII. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nA. The Sommerfeld model\nArguments here are made in the context of emission\nfrom the flat planar surface of a bulk metal represented by a\nSommerfeld-type free-electron model,6,7 as illustrated in\nFig. 1. This simplifies much detail but does not affect the\ngeneral validity of the conclusions. This model underlies\nmany past discussions of CFE theory. The direction of the\noutward normal \u0001from metal to vacuum\u0002 is termed the \u201cfor-\nwards\u201d direction.\nThe local depth of the potential-energy \u0001PE\u0002 well is de-\nnoted by \u0005. For a given electron state A, the total electron\nkinetic energy is denoted by K, and its components parallel\nand normal to the emitter surface by Kp and Kn, respectively.a\u0002Electronic mail: r.forbes@ieee.org.\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 103, 114911 \u00012008\u0002\n0021-8979\/2008\/103\u000211\u0001\/114911\/8\/$23.00 \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics103, 114911-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Param-\neters appropriate to state F, or the related barrier, are sub-\nscripted F.\nThe edge of the Sommerfeld well is aligned with the\nmetal\u2019s electrical surface.8,9 Distance z normal to the emit-\nting surface is measured outward from the electrical surface:\nthis ensures that the electrostatic PE of the emitted electron\nhas the usual limiting form \u2212eFz. In simple models, the im-\nage plane coincides with the electrical surface:9 this allows\nthe image PE to be written in the usual limiting form\n\u2212e2 \/16\u0003\u00010z.\nLet E denote the total electron energy and U the total\nelectron PE, both measured relative to the same \u0001arbitrary\u0002\nreference level. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be separated\ninto components associated with motion parallel and normal\nto the emitter surface. That for motion normal to the surface\ncan be written as\n\u0001\u0002P\n2 \/2me\u0002\u00032\u0006\/\u0003z2 + \u0001En \u2212 U\u0002\u0006 = 0, \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0006 is the electron wave function. The \u201cnormal energy\u201d\nEn \u0001sometimes called the \u201ctotal forwards energy\u201d\u0002 is the\ncomplete electron energy associated with motion normal to\nthe emitter surface and is defined by En=E\u2212Kp.\nTo simplify expressions below, we define\nM\u0001z\u0002 \u0005 U \u2212 En \u00012\u0002\nand call M\u0001z\u0002 the \u201cmotive energy\u201d for the electron. This\nname derives from the term \u201cmotive\u201d used by Herring and\nNichols10 for a similar \u0001but not exactly identical\u0002 concept.\nInside the barrier, the motive energy is a positive quantity\nequal to the negative of the electron kinetic energy in the\nforwards direction.\nThe \u201cshape\u201d of a tunneling barrier is defined by M\u0001z\u0002. In\nCFE, the simplest shape models used are the exact triangular\n\u0001ET\u0002 barrier MET\u0001z\u0002 and the Schottky\u2013Nordheim barrier11,12\nMSN\u0001z\u0002 given by\nMET\u0001z\u0002 = h \u2212 eFz , \u00013\u0002\nMSN\u0001z\u0002 = h \u2212 eFz \u2212 e2\/16\u0003\u00010z . \u00014\u0002\nB. FN tunneling from an individual state\nFor planar surfaces, the \u201ccore\u201d forms of FN-type equa-\ntion give J as a function of \u0004 and F. \u0001Nonplanar surfaces\nneed at least one additional parameter to describe surface\ncurvature.\u0002 Since neither F nor J can easily be measured\ndirectly, a complete theory also includes factors that relate J\nand F to the measured current I and voltage V, but we need\nnot consider these factors here.\nDerivation of the core form of FN-type equation has two\nmain stages. First, the contribution made to J by an electron\napproaching the barrier in a particular electronic state is\nfound. Then, these contributions are summed over all occu-\npied electronic states.\nTo define individual states, we use the model of Ref. 3,\nAppendix. The emitter electrons are taken as free electrons\nconfined\/defined within a large rectangular box, where the\nfront face of the box corresponds with the emitter surface.\n\u0001To avoid problems in the statistics of counting states, a large\nbox is needed.\u0002 Consider an electron in initial state i that has\na component of current density in the forwards direction.\nDenote this current-density component by zi when the state is\nfully occupied. When the state is partially occupied, with\noccupation probability f i, the current-density contribution is\nf izi. Denote the current density escaping from the state \u0001by\ntunneling through the surface barrier\u0002 by ji\u0001f i\u0002. When state i\nis fully occupied \u0001f i=1\u0002, then a tunneling probability \u0001or \u201ces-\ncape probability\u201d\u0002 Di is defined by\nji\u0001f i = 1\u0002 \u0005 ziDi. \u00015\u0002\nMore generally, the contribution ji made by the state to the\nECD J is\nji = f iziDi. \u00016\u0002\nIn most circumstances, it is adequate to take f i as the Fermi\u2013\nDirac distribution function.\nFor some types of emitter, such as closed \u0001capped\u0002 car-\nbon nanotubes, the assumption that the box can be taken as\nlarge is obviously problematical. Such cases need a different\napproach, partly analogous to the treatment of field\nionization,13 and are beyond the scope of this paper. \u0001Al-\nthough the conclusion is that a prefactor is present in such\ncases too\u0002.\nIn Eq. \u00016\u0002, the parameter ji is easy to define because it\nrepresents current moving away from the emitter after es-\ncape. The parameter zi needs a more careful examination. It\nis best interpreted as the current just inside the back face of\nthe box. By implication, the model assumes that the only\nscattering\/reflection process that affects the electron in state i\nis the partial reflection at the front face due to the tunneling\nFIG. 1.

It is assumed that no inelastic scattering processes\ninto or out of this state occur within the box and that there\nare no elastic reflection effects within the box as a result of\npotential-energy variations within it. Particularly for real\nemitters, both of these assumptions can be problematical.\nHowever, we need to make them at this stage of the discus-\nsion in order to focus on the physics of the barrier. These or\nsimilar assumptions have always been implicit in free-\nelectron models of FN tunneling.\nIn this initial discussion, it is also assumed that the bar-\nrier is \u201cwell behaved\u201d in the sense that tunneling probability\ndecreases smoothly as h \u0001the zero-field barrier height\u0002 in-\ncreases. This will always be the case if there are no\n\u201cresonance-type\u201d effects associated with potential structure\nwithin the barrier and no back reflection into the barrier by\nstructure beyond it. By making all these assumptions, we can\nfocus on the physics of the tunneling barrier alone.\nC. JWKB-type approximations\nIf expression \u00013\u0002 is inserted into Eq. \u00011\u0002, then the result-\ning ordinary differential equation \u0001ODE\u0002 can be solved, as\ndone by Fowler and Nordheim1 in their original 1928 paper.\nHowever, if expression \u00014\u0002 is inserted into Eq. \u00011\u0002, then it is\nimpossible in principle to solve the resulting ODE exactly in\nterms of the ordinary functions of mathematics. This conclu-\nsion seems to be a very firm result14 of continuing math-\nematical research that began nearly 200 years ago, and ap-\nplies to most realistic barrier shapes.\nIn consequence, approximate solution methods have\nbeen developed. The best known are the class of approxima-\ntions associated with names of Jeffreys,15 Kramer,16\nWentzel,17 and Brillouin18 \u0001JWKB\u0002. These build on earlier\nmathematical results, including the work by Horn19 and by\nFowler et al.20 \u0001see pp. 336\u2013339\u0002, and since the 1920s have\nbeen developed further by very many other workers \u0001for use-\nful reviews, see Refs. 13, 21, and 22\u0002.\nThe name \u201cJWKB approximation\u201d is now ambiguous\nbecause it covers several different mathematical approxima-\ntions and formulas that derive from a common historical ori-\ngin. I prefer to write \u201cJWKB-type\u201d approximations and for-\nmulas. The oldest and most basic of these, formula \u00017\u0002\nbelow, is often called the \u201cJWKB approximation\u201d \u0001or the\n\u201cWKB approximation,\u201d although the work of Jeffreys15 is\nearlier\u0002; I now call this the \u201csimple-JWKB formula.\u201d With\nthis formula, the tunneling probability D is given by\nD \u0006 exp\u0003\u2212 G\u0004 , \u00017\u0002\nwhere the so-called JWKB exponent G is defined by\nG \u0005 g\u0007 M1\/2dz . \u00018\u0002\nThe integral is taken over the range of z, where M\u0001z\u0002 is\npositive \u0001i.e., over the barrier\u0002 and g is a universal constant\n\u0001for a particle of given mass\u0002, given for an electron by\ng = 2\u00012me\u00021\/2\/\u0002P \b 10.24624 eV\u22121\/2 nm\u22121. \u00019\u0002\nSince the work of Murphy and Good23 in 1956, the simple-\nJWKB formula \u00017\u0002 has been very widely used in CFE theory.\nIn the 1960s, Fr\u00f6man and Fr\u00f6man14 \u0001FF\u0002 made a thor-\nough mathematical exploration of JWKB-type approxima-\ntions and developed a procedure for the exact evaluation of\nD. They concluded that descriptions of JWKB-type approxi-\nmations in many textbooks of theoretical physics \u0001including\nwell-recognized ones\u0002 were incomplete and unsatisfactory,\nand that some were mathematically incorrect.\nThe FF procedure leads to the result \u0003see their Eq.\n\u00019.10b\u0002\u0004\nD = 1\/\u00031 + \tF22\u0001\u2212 \u0007, + \u0007\u0002\t2eG\u0004 , \u000110\u0002\nwhere F22\u0001\u2212\u0007 , +\u0007\u0002 is a parameter that, at least in principle,\ncan be evaluated exactly by means of an algorithm involving\nrepeated integrations of a matrix of coefficients along a path\nin complex space that stays well clear of the singularities at\nthe barrier\u2019s classical turning points. They showed that their\nalgorithm converges and that \tF22\u0001\u2212\u0007 , +\u0007\u0002\u22121\t is bounded\n\u0003see their Eq. \u00016.22b\u0002\u0004.\nClearly, if a quantity pFF is defined by\npFF = \tF22\u0001\u2212 \u0007, + \u0007\u0002\t\u22122, \u000111\u0002\nthen Eq. \u000110\u0002 can be put in the form\nD = Pe\u2212G\/\u00011 + Pe\u2212G\u0002 , \u000112\u0002\nwhere P is given by pFF. We call P the \u201ctunneling prefactor,\u201d\nand Eq. \u000112\u0002 the \u201cFr\u00f6man and Fr\u00f6man \u0001FF\u0002 formula.\u201d\nAs shown in Fig. 2, expression \u000112\u0002 is a unifying for-\nmula for three other JWKB-type formulas in the literature,\nnamely, the simple-JWKB formula above, the Kemble\nformula,24,25 \u0001which was rederived later, by a slightly differ-\nent method, by Miller and Good26\u0002, and a formula stated\n\u0001without proof\u0002 by Landau and Lifschitz27 \u0001LL\u0002 \u0003see their Eq.\n\u000150.12\u0002\u0004. It also allows the reflection coefficient R \u0001for elec-\ntrons reflected by the barrier\u0002 to have the easily derived form\nR = 1 \u2212 D = 1\/\u00011 + Pe\u2212G\u0002 . \u000113\u0002\nThe three approximate formulas in Fig. 2 are obtained by\nmaking one or both of the approximations \u201ce\u2212G\b1\u201d or\n\u201cP\u21921\u201d in the FF formula. This suggests a two-way classi-\nfication of barriers as \u0001a\u0002 either \u201cweak\u201d \u0001e\u2212G\n1\u0002 or \u201cstrong\u201d\n\u0001e\u2212G\b1\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002 either ideally smooth \u0001\u201cideal\u201d\u0002 \u0001P=1\u0002 or\nnot ideally smooth \u0001\u201cnonideal\u201d\u0002 \u0001P\u00041\u0002.\nAn earlier paper5 used the terminology \u201csmooth\u201d\n\u0001P=1\u0002 or \u201csharp\u201d \u0001P\u00041\u0002: the present terminology seems\nbetter, since some nonideal barriers are relatively smooth.\nThe question arises as to how to categorize the barrier\nmodels used in CFE. The CFE regime is defined as the re-\nFIG. 2.

The original FN\ntreatment of an ET barrier generated a formula, Eq. \u000120\u0002\nbelow, that shows that it is nonideal. However, for the last 50\nyears, most CFE theory has omitted the tunneling prefactor.\nThe next section develops arguments to show that this is\nincorrect and that CFE tunneling barriers are nonideal. We\ndo this by comparing the formulas shown in Fig. 1 with\nformulas derived in the literature for barriers for which the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved exactly.\nIII. EXACTLY SOLVABLE BARRIERS\nThe barrier shapes that yield exact solutions of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation fall into two broad classes: those, such\nas the rectangular and triangular barriers, where M\u0001z\u0002 may\nhave discontinuities and dM \/dz and\/or d2M \/dz2 may have\ndiscontinuities or singularities, and those where there are no\nsuch discontinuities or singularities.

The tunneling probability for the\nsymmetrical rectangular barrier shown in Fig. 3 is usually\nwritten \u0001e.g., Ref. 27, p. 75\u0002 as\nDrb = 4k1\n2k2\n2\/\u00034k1\n2k2\n2 + \u0001k1\n2 + k2\n2\u00022 sinh2\u0001k2L\u0002\u0004 , \u000114\u0002\nwhere L is the barrier length, k1 \u0003=\u00012meKn\u00021\/2 \/\u0002P\u0004 is the\nelectron wave number in regions 1 and 3, and k2\n\u0003=\u00012meh\u00021\/2 \/\u0002P\u0004 is the decay constant in region 2. For this\nbarrier, G=2k2L=gh1\/2L, and we can rewrite Eq. \u000114\u0002 in\nterms of energies as\nDrb = 4Knh\/\u00034Knh + \u0001Kn + h\u00022 sinh2\u0001G\/2\u0002\u0004 . \u000115\u0002\nOn defining prb\u000516Knh \/ \u0001Kn+h\u00022, this can be rewritten as\nDrb = prbe\u2212G\/\u00031 + \u0001prb \u2212 2\u0002e\u2212G + e\u22122G\u0004 . \u000116\u0002\nClearly, if G is sufficiently large \u0001i.e., if the barrier is strong\u0002,\nthen we may neglect the terms in e\u2212G and e\u22122G in the de-\nnominator, yielding\nDrb \u0006 prbe\u2212G. \u000117\u0002\nET barrier.

In the present notation, the full FN\nresult, as stated at the top of p. 178 in Ref. 1, gives the\ntunneling probability as\nDFN = 4e\u2212Gh3\/2\u0001eF\u0002\u22121\/\u000b\u0003Kn1\/4\u0001h\/eF\u00021\/2\n+ h\u0001eF\u0002\u22121\/2Kn\n\u22121\/4e\u2212G\u00042 + \u00012\/g\u00022Kn\n\u22121\/2\u0003 12 \u0001eF\/h\u00021\/2\n+ h\u0001eF\u0002\u22121\/2\u0001g\/2\u0002a\u00042\f , \u000118\u0002\nwhere \t is the quantity used by FN.

In the strong-barrier limit, the formula then\nreduces to the FN formula \u000122\u0002.\nThere is a pattern in these approximation sequences. The\nexact expression derived for D depends on the barrier shape\nand on the details of the mathematics used. However, apply-\ning the strong-barrier approximation \u0001that G is \u201csufficiently\nlarge\u201d\u0002 then yields an expression of form Pe\u2212G, where P\n\u00041 and the approximated form for P depends only on bar-\nrier shape.\nFIG. 3. To illustrate the definitions of parameters associated with tunneling\nthrough a rectangular barrier.\n114911-4 Richard G. Forbes J. Appl.

The parabolic barrier\nThe opposite extreme to these \u201csharp\u201d barriers is the\nparabolic barrier Mpb\u0001x\u0002=h\u2212 12\nx2, where x is measured from\nthe barrier apex and \n is the constant curvature. For this\nbarrier, G=\u0003gh \/ \u00012\n\u00021\/2= \u0001\u0003 \/4\u0002gh1\/2L, where L is the barrier\nlength. The barrier can be described as ideally smooth be-\ncause d2M \/dx2=const. It was analyzed by Kemble,24,25 but\nan elegant proof is given by LL \u0001Ref. 27, p. 178\u0002, who, like\nFF, considered the wave-function behavior along a large\nsemicircle in a complex space. The outcome is the formula\nDpb = 1\/\u00011 + eG\u0002 = e\u2212G\/\u00011 + e\u2212G\u0002 . \u000125\u0002\nWhen G is large, this reduces to Dpb\u0006e\u2212G. For this barrier,\nthe prefactor in the FF formula \u000112\u0002 is, in some sense, physi-\ncally equal to 1.\nC. The Eckart barrier\nA significant test case is the Eckart barrier,31 for which\nthe motive energy is\nMEC\u0001x\u0002 = Aekx\/\u00011 + ekx\u0002 + Bekx\/\u00011 + ekx\u00022, \u000126\u0002\nwhere k is a constant that can be written in the form\nk=2\u0003 \/ l. The distance 2l is a measure of the length of the\nbarrier, as shown in Fig. 4. For this barrier, there are no\nsingularities or discontinuities in M\u0001x\u0002, but it is not as\nsmooth as the parabolic barrier because d2M \/dx2 varies with\nposition. It is sufficient to consider the symmetrical barrier\nobtained by putting A=0. For this symmetrical Eckart bar-\nrier, it can be shown, from his Eq. \u000117b\u0002, that\nDEC \u0006 pECe\u2212G, \u000127\u0002\nG = gl\u0001\u00051\/2 \u2212 Kn\n1\/2\u0002 , \u000128\u0002\npEC \u0006 1 \u2212 exp\u0003\u2212 glKn\n1\/2\u0004 , \u000129\u0002\nwhere \u0005 is the well depth \u0001Eckart\u2019s Vm\u0002 and Kn is the for-\nwards kinetic energy \u0001Eckart\u2019s W\u0002. Obviously, for this bar-\nrier, the prefactor is present in principle but would usually be\nvery close to unity.\nIV. RE-EXAMINATION OF STANDARD CFE THEORY\nThus, for all barriers tested here, except the parabolic\nbarrier, the expression for D reduces to the Landau and\nLifschitz1 form D\u0006Pe\u2013G\u0001P\u00041\u0002, when the strong-barrier ap-\nproximation is applied. In particular, this is the form of the\noriginal FN result. An important question is why the standard\nMurphy\u2013Good \u0001MG\u0002 treatment of CFE generates a formula\nwith P=1. The immediate reason is that the MG treatment\nstarts from the Kemble formula, which reduces to the\nsimple-JWKB formula when G becomes large. MG used the\nKemble formula because this is the stated outcome of the\nearlier analysis by Miller and Good.26\nLike the JWKB-type approximation, the Miller\u2013Good\napproximation is a quasiclassical approximation. However, it\ntakes a slightly different mathematical approach to the reso-\nlution of the difficulties associated with the classical turning\npoints at ends of the barrier. \u0001As a turning point is ap-\nproached, the quasiclassical electron wavelength becomes in-\nfinite, and the conditions for the applicability of a normal\nJWKB approach break down.\u0002 The Miller\u2013Good approach\nmakes use of auxiliary functions, which must have the same\ngeneral mathematical properties as the correct solutions but\notherwise may be chosen arbitrarily. In practice, the auxiliary\nfunctions they chose were related to the solutions of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for a parabolic bonding well.\nIn the present notation, the MG stated result \u0003their Eq.\n\u000137\u0002\u0004 is D\u00061 \/ \u00011+eG\u0002. That is, they confirm that D is ap-\nproximately given by Kemble\u2019s24 formula. Details of the fi-\nnal steps in this derivation are not given, and I am unable to\nestablish precisely what mathematical approximations were\nmade, but it is clear that this is not an exact result. This is\nconfirmed by a test conducted by Miller and Good.26 They\napplied their formula to a particular case of the Eckart po-\ntential, for which exact results can be derived. In circum-\nstances where D\u00060.4, the exact result for D is about 20%\nhigher than their formula predicts.\nIn the strong-barrier limit, their formula becomes identi-\ncal with the simple-JWKB formula D\u0006e\u2212G. From the trend\nshown in their Fig. 3, it seems clear that their formula will\nunderpredict the exact result. This means that the correct\nresult should contain a correction factor that can be inter-\npreted as a tunneling prefactor. However, the correction fac-\ntor looks to be close to unity.\nThe following suspicion also exists but is difficult to\nconfirm without extensive new analysis. Namely, their use of\nauxiliary functions that are the Schr\u00f6dinger equation solu-\ntions for the \u0001ideally smooth\u0002 parabolic barrier may have\ngenerated a result less general than originally believed.\nHistorically, what then seems to have happened is that,\nbecause the correction factor seemed close to unity, Murphy\nand Good adopted the Kemble\/Miller Good formula as a\nstarting point. MG do clearly describe it as an approximation\n\u0003see MG\u2019s discussion relating to their Eq. \u00015\u0002\u0004. However,\nFIG. 4. The Eckart potential, as described by Eq. \u000126\u0002.

THEORETICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR FN-TYPE\nEQUATIONS\nA. Effect on form of equations\nWe next look at consequences of using the LL formula,\nrather than the simple-JWKB formula, for the integration\nover internal electronic states that leads to FN-type equa-\ntions. The treatment here generalizes the Forbes3 2004 ap-\nproach and applies to a strong barrier of arbitrary but well-\nbehaved shape.\nReference 3 shows that, for emission at zero temperature\nfrom a metal-like free-electron band, this integration yields a\nFN-type equation that can be written in the general form\nJ = ZFDF = zSdF\n2DF, \u000130\u0002\nwhere zS \u0003\u00054\u0003eme \/hP\n3\n=1.618 311\f1014 A m\u22122 eV\u22122\u0004 is a\nuniversal constant7 here called the Sommerfeld electron sup-\nply density, dF and DF are, respectively, the \u201cdecay width at\nthe Fermi level\u201d and the \u201cescape probability at the Fermi\nlevel\u201d \u0001i.e., parameters for a barrier of unreduced height \u0004\u0002,\nand ZF \u0003\u0005zSdF\n2\u0004 is a quantity I call the \u201ceffective electron\nsupply.\u201d\nReference 3 also shows that when the simple-JWKB for-\nmula is applied to the ET barrier, GF, dF, and ZF are given \u0001in\nthis \u201celementary\u201d theory\u0002 by the quantities GF\nel\n, dF\nel\n, and ZF\nel\ndefined by\n\tGF\nel \u0005 Gel\th=\u0004 = b\u00043\/2\/F , \u000131a\u0002\n1\/dF\nel \u0005 \t\u0003Gel\/\u0003h\th=\u0004 = \u00013\/2\u0002b\u00041\/2\/F = \u00013\/2\u0002GF\nel\/\u0004 , \u000131b\u0002\nZF\nel \u0005 zS\u0001dF\nel\u00022 = a\u0004\u22121F2. \u000131c\u0002\nWhen the simple-JWKB formula is applied to the arbi-\ntrary well-behaved barrier, Ref. 3 shows that GF, 1 \/dF, and\nZF are obtained by multiplying the three equations above by\ncorrection factors \rF, \u000eF, and \u000eF\n\u22122\n, respectively. The precise\nform of these correction factors depends on the barrier shape.\nIn deriving these formulas, the integration over occupied\nstates requires that the escape probability D\u0001h\u0002 be expanded\nin the form\nD\u0001h\u0002 = DF exp\u0001\u2212 \u000fh\/dF\u0002 , \u000132\u0002\nwhere \u000fh=h\u2212\u0004. When the LL formula \u0001rather than the\nsimple-JWKB formula\u0002 is used, the full formal definition of\ndecay width d has to be used. As shown in the Appendix,\nwhen this full definition is applied to the LL formula for D,\nwe obtain\n1\/d \u0005 \u2212 \u0003 ln\u000bD\f\/\u0003h = \u0003G\/\u0003h \u2212 \u0003 ln\u000bP\f\/\u0003h . \u000133\u0002\nObviously, the last term can be omitted when P is approxi-\nmated as 1 \u0001or as a constant\u0002, so the simplified version of Eq.\n\u000133\u0002 has been used in previous papers.\nIt is now shown how the present treatment \u0001based on\napplying the LL formula to the arbitrary well-behaved bar-\nrier\u0002 relates to the elementary treatment \u0001based on applying\nthe simple-JWKB formula to the ET barrier\u0002. It seems best to\nhave \u000e retain its existing definition. By analogy with Ref. 3,\nif dF can be written in the form\ndF = \u0010D\n1\/2dF\nel\n, \u000134\u0002\nwhere \u0010D is a correction factor defined via Eq. \u000132\u0002, then ZF\ncan be written in the form\nZF = \u0010Da\u0004\u22121F2. \u000135\u0002\nUsing definition \u000133\u0002 and noting that for an arbitrary\nwell-behaved barrier \t\u0003Gel \/\u0003h\th=\u0004,=\u000eF \/dF\nel\n, we obtain\n1\/dF = \u000eF\/dF\nel\n\u2212 \t\u0003 ln\u000bP\f\/\u0003h\th=\u0004, \u000136\u0002\n\u0010D\n\u22121\/2\n= dF\nel\/dF = \u000eF\u00031 \u2212 \u000eF\n\u20131dF\nel \u0003 ln\u000bP\f\/\t\u0003h\th=\u0004\u0004 \u0005 \u000eF\u0010P\n\u22121\/2\n,\n\u000137\u0002\nwhere \u0010P is a correction factor defined by this equation.\nIn this new treatment, the escape probability DF is given\nby\nDF = PF exp\u0003\u2212 \rFb\u00043\/2\/F\u0004 . \u000138\u0002\nThe FN-type equation that results when the LL formula is\napplied to a strong barrier of well-behaved but arbitrary\nshape thus takes the form\nJ = \u0010Da\u0004\u22121F2PF exp\u0003\u2212 \rFb\u00043\/2\/F\u0004 . \u000139\u0002\nElsewhere,5 I have called this the \u201cgeneral \u0001zero-K\u0002 free-\nelectron FN-type equation.\u201d \u0001The designation \u201czero-K\u201d indi-\ncates that the derivation is strictly valid only at a temperature\nof 0 K; in practice, no significant error arises from applying\nzero-K formulas to emission at room temperature.\u0002\nThe analysis of FN plots is also affected. Some general\nresults for FN-type equations were given some years ago2\nand may be applied here by identifying \u0010 and \u0011 in Ref. 2\nwith \u0001\u0010P\u000eF\n\u22122PF\u0002 and \rF here. In particular, the intercept cor-\nrection factor \u0001denoted here by \u0012 rather than r \u2014see Ref. 4\u0002\nis given by\n\u0012 = \u0010DPF exp\u0003\u2212 b\u00043\/2d\rF\/dF\u0004 . \u000140\u0002\nB. Discussion\nNumerical estimates are now needed. Due to mathemati-\ncal difficulties noted earlier, accurate calculations of the pa-\nrameters PF and \u0010D for realistic barrier models cannot easily\nbe made. However, illustrative estimates can be found from\nthe FN prefactor pFN. Using expression \u000119\u0002 above to substi-\ntute for the parameter P in Eq. \u000137\u0002 and the definitions of GF\nel\nand dF\nel\n, we obtain\n\u0010P\n\u22121\/2 \u0006 1 \u2212 \u000eF\n\u22121\u00011\/3\u0002\u0001KF \u2212 \u0004\u0002\/\u0001KFGF\nel\u0002 . \u000141\u0002\nAs illustrative values, we take KF=10 eV, \u0004=5 eV, GFel\n=5, and \u000eF\u00061; these yield PF\u00061.9 and \u0010P\u00061.07.\nSimple smooth \u0001but nonideal\u0002 barrier models might pre-\ndict values of PF and \u0010P closer to unity than these values, but\n\u0001as noted below\u0002 real emitters might have values further from\nunity. On the face of things, the value of PF might sometimes\n114911-6 Richard G. Forbes J. Appl. Phys. 103, 114911 \u00022008\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nbe of practical significance, but value of \u0010P is unlikely to be.\nA factor very similar to \u0010P was disregarded by FN in their\noriginal treatment.1\nSince the derivation of a FN-type equation involves the\nintegration of D over occupied states, it seems best to use the\ncombined factor \u0010D \u0001rather than the clumsy combination\n\u0010P\u000eF\n\u22122\u0002 in FN-type equations. In the author\u2019s view, it should\nbe sufficient in most predictive calculations to put \u0010D=1.\nThe arguments here suggest that the standard \u0001MG\u0002 FN-\ntype equation should be replaced by Eq. \u000139\u0002. In practice, as\nargued elsewhere,5 one might want to generalize Eq. \u000139\u0002\nfurther by multiplying by a factor \u0010B representing band-\nstructure effects on electron densities of states and \u0001perhaps\u0002\nby a factor \u0010T representing temperature effects.\nVI. OTHER USES OF THE PREFACTOR\nIncluding the prefactor in evaluations of D, and in the\nresulting FN-type equations, also brings within the scope of\na single form of equation various effects that until now have\nbeen ignored or treated separately. These effects arise when\nwe note that, in reality, an electron moves in the whole po-\ntential structure relevant to its coherence length, and take\ninto account potential-energy variations that are more realis-\ntic than those used in the usual simple models. It is beyond\nthis paper\u2019s scope to discuss numerics, but relevant effects\ninclude the following.\n\u00011\u0002 If one takes the front surface of the \u201clarge box\u201d used in\nSec. II at the inner edge of the tunneling barrier, then the\nsharp changes in potential at the \u201cemitter surface\u201d \u0001how-\never these are represented\u0002 will give rise to reflection-\ntype effects and change the value of P. It is well estab-\nlished that electron reflection from this \u201cjoin\u201d region can\ngive rise to observable phenomena, for example, the re-\nflection factor in the Richardson equation \u0001e.g., Refs. 10\nand 32\u0002, the periodic field-dependent deviations in\nSchottky emission \u0001e.g., Refs. 10 and 33\u0002, and the\nJason34 effect in surface field ionization.\n\u00012\u0002 In more realistic models32,35 that include atomic struc-\nture, the need to match the wave function in the barrier\nto an atomic-type wave function, at the outer edge of the\natomic bonding well, will influence the value of P.\nModinos36 discussed these effects.\n\u00013\u0002 If there is a thin conducting film at the emitter surface,\nof material different from that of the underlying sub-\nstrate and of thickness less than the coherence length of\nelectrons approaching it from the substrate, then scatter-\ning or resonance-type effects may affect the value of P.\nThe existence of such effects is well established, both\ntheoretically and experimentally \u0001e.g., Ref. 37\u0002. How-\never, they have weaker experimental consequences than\none might expect, both on the total energy distribution\nand in current\/voltage characteristics, because they tend\nto be \u201csmoothed out\u201d in the integration over electronic\nstates.\n\u00014\u0002 With semiconductors \u0001and similar materials\u0002, field pen-\netration and band bending at the emitter surface may\nlead to wave-function modification that affects the value\nof P.\n\u00015\u0002 If there is a sharp structure in the barrier itself and\/or\nback reflection from structure beyond the barrier, then\nthe value of P will be affected \u0001or it may be necessary to\nuse a more complex expression for the tunneling prob-\nability D that does not reduce easily to the LL form\u0002.\nJensen28,29,38 discussed effects of this type.\nValues of P resulting from these effects can sometimes\nbe substantially different from unity. So, it seems best to\nalways use the LL formula as the physically relevant formula\nfor a strong barrier, even in circumstances where simple bar-\nrier models would suggest that P is close to unity.\nVII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has argued for the \u0001re\u0002introduction of a tun-\nneling prefactor into expressions for the escape probability\nfor FN tunneling and into FN-type equations. An approach\nbased on Fr\u00f6man and Fr\u00f6man\u2019s work suggests that barriers\ncan be classified using two characteristics: whether they are\nweak or strong and whether they are ideal or nonideal. As\nsummarized in Fig. 2, this suggests the existence of four\nrelated JWKB-type formulas, namely the FF formula and\nthree approximations, applicable to the different cases.\nFor the past 50 years, CFE theory has been developed\nmainly by means of the simple-JWKB formula \u00017\u0002 that\nstrictly applies only to the ideal parabolic barrier. This is\nmathematically incorrect, and the resulting formulas are con-\nceptually incomplete. Examination of various cases where\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved exactly confirms\nthat, in the \u201cstrong-barrier\u201d \u0001CFE\u0002 regime, approximate ex-\npressions for tunneling probability D and FN-type equations\nshould contain a tunneling prefactor. For the simple\nSchottky\u2013Nordheim barrier model, and for other relatively\nsmooth simple barrier models, P may be relatively close to\nunity. However, there is no guarantee that this is true for CFE\nfrom real emitters, where electrons move in a much more\ncomplicated potential structure, as they approach the emitter\nsurface. The discussion in Sec. VI notes physical circum-\nstances where P can be substantially different from unity. So,\nthe prefactor P should always be explicitly present in expres-\nsions for D, and the factor PF always present in FN-type\nequations.\nWhen the integration over internal states is carried out,\nthis generates a further correction factor \u0010D that takes the\nplace of the factor \u000eF\n\u22122 that appears in the standard FN-type\nequation. This factor \u0010D should in principle be present in\nFN-type equations but can be approximated to unity when\nmaking predictive calculations. The product \u0010DPF should be\npresent in expressions for the intercept correction factor \u0012.\nAt present, numerical values for P and PF are difficult to\npredict accurately, in part because the motion of the electron\nin the whole of the relevant potential structure \u0001not just the\nbarrier\u0002 needs to be taken into account. However, the pres-\nence of the factor \u0010DPF in FN-type-equation pre-\nexponentials \u0001along with a factor \u0010B caused by band-\nstructure effects\u0002 might sometimes be relevant to the\ninterpretation of apparently anomalous experimental results.\nBroadly analogous considerations about prefactors apply\nto emission theory in the higher-temperature regime where\n114911-7 Richard G.

The expansion is about the\nvalue h=\u0004, in terms of \u000fh=h\u2212\u0004. Because D decreases ap-\nproximately exponentially as h increases, one seeks an ex-\npansion in the form\nD\u0001h\u0002 = D\u0001\u0004\u0002K\u0001\u000fh\u0002 , \u0001A1\u0002\nwhere K\u0001\u000fh\u0002 is a factor that needs to be found.\nTaking natural logarithms, we have\nln\u0003D\u0001h\u0002\u0004 = ln\u0003D\u0001\u0004\u0002\u0004 + ln\u0003K\u0001\u000fh\u0002\u0004 . \u0001A2\u0002\nThis is a Taylor-type expansion of ln\u0003D\u0001h\u0002\u0004 with respect to h\nif we take\nln\u0003K\u0001\u000fh\u0002\u0004 = \t\u0001\u000f ln D \u0003 h\u0002\th=\u0004\u000fh \u0005 \u2212 \u000fh\/dF, \u0001A3\u0002\nwhere dF is defined by this equation. The quantity ln\u0003K\u0001\u000fh\u0002\u0004\nis clearly negative, so the minus sign is inserted into defini-\ntion \u0001A3\u0002 to make dF positive. If we use the LL formula for\nescape probability, then dF is the value, for a barrier of un-\nreduced height \u0004, of the quantity d given by\n1\/d = \u2212 \u0001\u000f ln D\/\u0003h\u0002 = \u0003G\/\u0003h \u2212 \u0003 ln\u000bP\f\/\u0003h . \u0001A4\u0002\nd is termed the \u201cdecay width,\u201d has the dimensions of energy,\nand in practice is measured in eV.
