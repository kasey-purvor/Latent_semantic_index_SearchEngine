Books such as Charles Reich\u2019s, \u201cThe Greening of America\u201d, \nAlvin Toffler\u2019s \u201cFuture Shock\u201d and Theodore Roszak\u2019s, \u201cThe making of a counter \nculture\u201d appeared. The message articulated was basically that the people could no \nlonger be thought of as \u201cconsumers\u201d, or some aggregate variable in the grand \nmarketing design.  Feelings such as these led to a view that capitalism presents an \nunacceptable face, promoting, as it does, an acquisitive, and materialistic society.  As \none of the more visible manifestations of such activity, marketing has been singled \nout, for surely it plays on people\u2019s weaknesses and, by insidious means, attempts to \npersuade the consumer to do things, without which their lives will be incomplete, an \nargument that involves the notion of the defenceless consumer.  This last point \ndeserves close examination, for it confuses needs with wants.  But, even worse, any \nscrupulous marketer must reject the view of defenceless consumers. \n \nNo matter what `marketing\u2019 is performed, the consumer is still sovereign as long as he \nor she is free to make choices \u2013 either choices between competing products or the \nchoice not to buy at all.  Indeed, it could be argued that by extending the range of \nchoices that the consumer has available, marketing is enhancing consumer \nsovereignty rather than eroding it.  It should be noted, too, that although promotional \nactivity may persuade an individual to buy a product or service for the first time, \npromotion is unlikely to be the persuasive factor in subsequent purchases, when the \nconsumer is acting from first-hand experience of the product. \n \nSeveral specific issues have formed the focus of the debate on the ethics of marketing.  \nThe main concerns include: \n \n\u2022 Marketing\u2019s contribution to materialism. \n\u2022 Rising consumer expectations as a result of marketing pressure. \n\u2022 The use of advertising to mislead or distort. \n \nIt is, therefore, important to consider the arguments involved in these discussions. \n \nMarketing, it has been suggested, helps to feed, and in turn feeds on, the materialistic \nand acquisitive urges of society.  Implicit in such criticism is the value judgement that \nmaterialism and acquisitiveness are in themselves undesirable.  Supporters would \nargue that marketing contributes to a general raising of the level of consumer \nexpectations.  These expectations are more than simple aspirations: they represent a  \ndesire to acquire a specific set of gratifications through the purchase of goods and \nservices.  The desire for these gratifications is fuelled by marketing\u2019s insistent \nmessages.  Further, if the individual lacks the financial resources with which to fulfil \nthese expectations, then this inevitable adds to a greater awareness of differences in \nsociety and to dissatisfaction and unrest among those in this situation. \n \nThe counter-argument here is that marketing itself does not contribute to rising \nexpectations and thus to differences in society; it merely makes people aware of, and \nbetter informed about, the differences that already exist in society.  In this respect, it \ncan be claimed that its effects are beneficial, since it supports, even hastens, pressures \nfor redistribution.  It can also be argued that materialism is not a recent phenomenon \ncorrelated with the advent of mass marketing. \n \nMuch of the criticism levelled at marketing is in fact directed at one aspect of it: \nadvertising.  Advertising practitioners themselves are fully conscious of these \ncriticisms.  These include the ideas that advertising: \n \n\u2022 Makes misleading claims about product or services \n\u2022 Uses hidden, dangerously powerful techniques of persuasion. \n\u2022 By encouraging undesirable attitudes, has adverse social effects. \n\u2022 Works through the exploitation of human inadequacy. \n \nAdvertisers themselves would point to the fact that advertising in all its forms is \nheavily controlled in most Western Societies, either by self \u2013imposed codes (such as \nthe British Code of Advertising Practice) or by legislation (such as the Trade \nDescription Acts) and that it cannot by itself achieve sustained patterns of repeat \npurchase. \n \nThe debate about the ethics of marketing also often confuses marketing institutions \nwith the people who work in them.  However, it seems a grave error to criticise \nmarketing institutions because of the practices of a small number of unethical \nmarketers.  It is clear, for example, that there are advertisers who engage in deceptive \npractise designed to mislead and possible defraud consumers.  Nevertheless, the \ninstitution of advertising can be used not only to inform consumers about potentially \nbeneficial new products, such as new energy-saving technologies, but also to promote \nnon-profit community services, such as theatres and state education.  This argument \ncan, of course, be applied to all marketing activities. \n \nClosely connected with the issue of the ethics of marketing is the issue of \nconsumerism. Ironically, consumerism is pro-marketing; it wants the marketing \napproach to business implemented in a sincere rather than cynical spirit. The cynical \nimplementation, which consumerists claim has been too widely practiced, is no better \nthan high-pressure salesmanship or misleading puffery. The sincere implementation \nof the marketing approach entails respect from each individual consumer served. \nBetter marketing has always emanated from a deep understanding of consumer \nexpectations combined with their right to be informed and protected and their right to \nquality of life. \n \nThe marketing of children\u2019s toys provides an example of customers, consumers and \ncompany objectives can all be satisfied by careful business practice. The successful \ntoy companies of today are those which inform parents that their products are not \nparticularly dangerous, not coated with lead paint, and not destroyed an hour after \nthey are first pressed into active service.  \n \nSecondly, Michael says \u201cless than one fifth of the world\u2019s population has real \ndiscretionary income\u201d. If we read Sir Paul Judge\u2019s inaugural RSA lecture (15th \nOctober 2003) we would see that there is a benign change taking place, impeded, alas \nby politicians. \u201cIf Africa, East Asia, South Africa and Latin America were allowed to \nincrease their share of world exports by 1%, the resulting gains in income could lift \n128 million people out of poverty. In Africa alone, this would generate $70 billion, \nabout five times what the continent receives in aid\u2026.. The West has extensive tariffs \non raw materials and textiles, the very items that developing countries can \nexport\u2026..The developed world pays itself about $1 billion a day in agricultural \nsubsidies, five times as much as it gives in aid. An EU cow gets a subsidy of $2 a day \nin a world where 800 million people live on less than a \u201cdollar a day\u201d. So against such \nodds, the argument about marketing pales into insignificance!!   \n \nThirdly, we are all, surely, aware of Hugh Davidson\u2019s research into the values and \nvision of 125 continuously high-performing enterprises from the USA and UK (The \nCommitted Enterprise, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2002 \u2013 70 business, 27 education, 12 \nhospitals\/police\/military, 16 arts\/charities\/religion). Companies like Shell get their just \ndeserts when they ignore the power of the consumer. \n \nLastly (and briefly), Michael says: \u201cthe postmodernists are threatening that world\u201d. \nMy view is that, postmodernism in marketing is an invention. Indeed, Stephen \nBrown\u2019s usual response to the question \u201cWhat is postmodernism?\u201d is \u201cpostmodernism \nisn\u2019t\u201d. I believe it is artificial and arbitrary. It amuses some academics and deeply \nimpresses others. \n \nHowever, this isn\u2019t the place to argue this one and in any case, I shall be given the \nopportunity to share my views on a topic of my choice in a future viewpoint.  \n \nMy conclusion? Thanks to Michael for asking some serious questions, but I believe \nsuccessful marketers and marketing institutions have already embraced these ideas.   \n"}
