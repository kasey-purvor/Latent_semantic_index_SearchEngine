There is a strong and increasing policy requirement for effective monitoring \nof soils at local, regional and national scales. However, it remains unclear which \nproperties of soils are most appropriately monitored. This is partly due to the wide range \nof goods and services that soils provide, but also their inherent chemical, physical and \nbiological complexity. Given that the biota plays such fundamental roles in the majority \nof ecosystem services provided by soils, biological properties are logical candidates as \neffective indicators, to complement other physico-chemical properties. A plethora of \nbiological methods have been suggested as indicators for monitoring soils but few are \nused in national scale monitoring or are published as international standards. A \nframework for selecting ecologically-relevant biological indicators of soil quality for \nnational-scale soil monitoring that covers the full range of ecological functions and \nservices of soil was devised. The literature was surveyed to identify 183 candidate \nbiological indicators which were then scored by experts and stakeholders against a wide \nrange of scientific and technical criteria. The framework used the scores and weightings \nto then rank, prioritise and select the indicators. This semi-objective approach using a \n\u201clogical-sieve\u201d allowed repeated iterations to take account of end-user requirements and \nexpert opinion. A ranked list of 21 indicators was produced that covered a range of \ngenotypic-, phenotypic- and functional-based indicators for different trophic groups. Four \nof these were not deemed sufficiently robust for ready deployment in a national-scale \nmonitoring scheme without further methodological development. The suite of indicators \nidentified offers the strongest potential candidates for deployment in national-scale soil \nmonitoring schemes provided standard operating procedures are defined and their \n2 \ninherent sensitivity, ability to discriminate between soil:land-use combinations, and \nprovide ecologically interpretable signals is confirmed. The power of the approach \nadopted here is that it provides a clear record and audit trail on the decision-making \nprocess, enables different priorities to be set contingent on the nature of the desired \nmonitoring, and can direct and allow the inclusion of further methods or indicators into \nthe framework. \n \nKey-words: Biological indicators, Soil health, Soil quality, Monitoring.  \n1. Introduction \nHuman societies have always been highly dependent upon healthy soils for their \nnutritional, economic and social well-being and the associated requirement for delivery of \necosystem goods and services ((Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Consequently, \nrequirements for monitoring soil quality are increasing and targeted at gathering \ninformation on soil functions, rather than soil properties per se. These functions include \nbiomass production for food and fibre, protection of our environment through interactions \nbetween soils, air and water, support of habitats and biodiversity, protection of \narchaeological remains, provision of a platform for building, and provision of raw \nmaterials (Blum 2005).  \nSuch is the acknowledged significance of these functions that they now form the basis for \nthe proposed legislative protection of soils in the emerging European Communities \nFramework Directive (Commission of the European Communities 2006a;Commission of \nthe European Communities 2006b) and have been used to identify requirements for soil \nprotection and management within the UK policy framework (SEPA 2001;Defra \n2004;Environment Agency 2004;Towers et al. 2006). These policies have to \n3 \naccommodate challenging scientific issues since soils are amongst the most complex \nsystems on the planet.  \nSoil functions represent aggregated properties and processes such as decomposition, \nnutrient cycling, water retention and release, and the regulation of populations. Whilst \nphysico-chemical properties of soils provide the fundamental context in which such \nfunctions operate, and have acknowledged utility in assessing ecological status, the \nmajority of soil processes are underpinned by the soil biota. However, a mechanistic \nunderstanding of the relationships between soil biodiversity and function, whether in \nrelation to the soil compartment or entire ecosystem, are undeniably complex and remain \nelusive (Bardgett et al. 2005;Fitter et al. 2005;Hooper et al. 2005). Whilst the definition \nof pertinent biological indicators is a challenging task, it is reasonable to propose that \nbiological indicators should be considered in any monitoring of soil quality (Francaviglia \n2008). Biological indicators, by virtue of their involving complex adaptive systems (i.e. \nthe biota) integrate multi-dimensional phenomena such as the delivery of key soil \nprocesses in ways that other indicators do not. Biodiversity is a soil attribute in itself, and \ntherefore implicit within the ecosystem approach (Doran and Zeiss 2000). Numerous \nreviews and reports have been published on soil biological indicators, with much \nemphasis on ecotoxicological perspectives, but many of these have direct relevance to \nnational-scale monitoring schemes (Buchs 2003;Gadzala-Kopciuch et al. 2004;Arias et \nal. 2005;Becaert and Deschenes 2006). Biological indicators have already been deployed \nin a number of schemes throughout Europe and elsewhere (Parris 1998;Ditzler and Tugel \n2002;Black et al. 2003;Lilburne et al. 2004;Winding et al. 2005). Although comparability \nbetween different international schemes may be desirable, from a scientific and political \nperspective, consideration is required to ensure that biological indicators chosen for \n4 \ndeployment in a nationwide monitoring framework are scientifically and technically \nappropriate. They must also be capable of addressing national soil\/environmental \nprotection policy requirements and are therefore practicable for the environment they are \nbeing applied to. \nWithin the UK, the deployment of soil biological indicators in an extensive monitoring \nscheme was first carried out in the Countryside Survey of Great Britain (Black et al. \n2003). The policy focus is now on establishing the most appropriate biological indicators \nfor nationwide monitoring from an immense number of potential indicators and \nassociated methods. These actions parallel other initiatives in the UK, Europe and North \nAmerica (e.g. (Countryside Survey 2008;ENVASSO 2008;NEON 2008;Programme 3 \n2008). However the numbers and scope of published information on potential biological \nindicators of soil quality has expanded rapidly in recent years. For example a Web of \nKnowledge based search for journal papers using a suite of keywords associated with \nbiological indicators and soils shows an essentially exponential increase in number of \npapers from the 1970\u2019s to date (totalling in excess of 17,500 by 1970-2008). The \nselection of biological indicators has thus gone beyond the reasonable scope of a \nconventional considered literature review or a standard meta-data analysis. Most reviews \nof biological indicators have a strong discipline bias, orientated for example to microbial, \ninvertebrate or ecological processes. As (Niemeijer and de Groot 2008) point out, formal \ncriteria relating to the utility of a particular indicator within the total collective set of \nindicators are rarely considered. We considered that any approach to the selection of \nbiological indicators should be objective, realistic, sufficiently flexible to accommodate \nemergent knowledge and adaptable to changing end-user or policy requirements. To \naccommodate these issues, we devised a generic framework that supported a structured \n5 \napproach to the identification of potential indicators for monitoring the status and change \nin soils, with the specific purpose of formulating a list of candidate biological indicators \nof soil quality that demonstrated most potential for application in a national-scale soil \nmonitoring programme. As such, the decision-making process was informed by the \nrequirements of the UK Soil Indicators Consortium (UKSIC 2008), a group of public \nstakeholders developing a set of soil indicators and a soil monitoring scheme for the UK, \nbut could be applied for selecting indicators in other ecological contexts.  \n \n2. Methods \n2.1. Basic approach \nIn considering a concept as broad as biological indicators of soil quality, we first had to \ndefine the boundaries of what we were attempting. Following the approach of (Doran and \nZeiss 2000), we asserted that the quality of a soil relates to the provision of an \nappropriate set of soil properties and processes necessary for effective soil function i.e. to \nprovide soils that are fit for purpose. Given this context, biological indicators can then be \nused to assess the status and change in ecological soil properties and processes within a \nphysico-chemical context.  \nAccepting we had to constrain the scope of the study, our basic approach was as follows: \n(a)  A subset of three pertinent ecological soil functions was prescribed, viz. food and \nfibre production, environmental interactions, and habitats and biodiversity \nsupport. These functions have been adopted by a wide stakeholder community \nand hence have resonance with both science and policy communities. These \nfunctions are dependant upon a range of ecological processes and properties \n6 \n(Table 1) and therefore most likely to be informed by the use of biological \nindicators of soil quality. This list of ecological processes and properties is not \ndetailed, and serves to establish what primary information would be required from \nbiological indicators to usefully inform on the individual functions.  \n(b)  A comprehensive list of potential biological indicators of soil quality pertinent to \nthe prescribed functions and ecological properties \/ processes was established by a \ntrawl and review of the peer-reviewed literature in October 2004. An indicator \nwas designated by either the ecological property or process that is assessed, and \nby the method used to measure this property or process. \n(c)  A simple database was constructed where each indicator was assigned a unique \nreference number (#) and then categorised to one of four primary categories, \ndenoted Genotypic, Phenotypic, Functional or Other, and one of eight secondary \ncategories denoted Activity, Biomarker, Biomass, Enzyme, Fauna, Nucleic acid, \nProcess or Other (Table S1). \n(d)  Each potential indicator was then assessed by a 'factor score' (F) derived from the \nfollowing three categories, each with defined scoring criteria:  \n(i)  Pertinence to the defined soil functions, denoted FSF (Table 2). \n(ii)  Applicability to the range of ecosystems under consideration, and \nability to discriminate between soils that are intrinsically different in \nrelation to the considered criteria, denoted FAD (Table 3). \n(iii)  Technical category, relevant to implementation in a national-scale soil \nmonitoring scheme, denoted FT (Table 4).  \n7 \n(e)  For each criterion within the technical category, weighting factors were \nprescribed by a process of stakeholder consultation with the scientific community \nand likely end-user public-bodies. Respondents assigned weighting factors \nranging from 0 (lowest) to 4 (highest) to each of the 13 technical criteria to reflect \ntheir views on the extent or temporal scale of any proposed application, their end-\nuser requirements and actual or perceived budgetary constraints.  \n(f)  Each potential indicator was then given an individual numerical score for each \ncriterion in all categories; an indicator was only left unscored if its relevance was \nunknown. \nThe possible range of score values within each sub-set were set according to the \nnature of the corresponding criterion or question. Certain of the categories can only \nactually have a binary response, and are phrased as such. For example, for certain \nassays - such as some in situ activity methods - soil material simply cannot be \narchived; one-stop (single punctuated) sampling in the field is either tenable or not, \nand so on. We also elected to keep the majority of the other scores to three since it \nmade the assessment procedure simpler and more rapid. Of course, more than three \nscores could be assigned to such non-binary categories, and this would increase the \neffective range (and precision) of the final score list, but we considered that given the \nnature of the categories such precision would actually be illusory, and at the expense \nof ease-of-application of the logical sieve. For the consultation phase, we provided a \npotential range of five scores, for just this purpose of expanding the final score range, \nsince here the questions are more subjective and more amenable to such an expanded \nnumber of potential scores. \n2.2. Framework to rank indicators \n8 \nIn order to structure the overall assessment according to our aims, a conceptual \nframework, termed a 'logical sieve', was devised to provide an objective and quantitative \nmeans of ranking the potential indicators. The framework was designed to be sufficiently \nflexible that it can be re-tuned according to the precise nature of the users\u2019 needs, and can \nbe updated as new knowledge is accrued. The \u2018sieving\u2019 functions are also flexible and \noperate on the principle of achieving a ranking based on grading with respect to user-\ndefined scenarios.  \nAs described above, the assessment was based on numerical scores assigned to each \nindicator with respect to the prescribed suite of criteria. Scores were assigned using the \nexpert knowledge of the authors and their local peer-groups. Three instances of scoring \nwere carried out, based upon partner organisations (i.e. Cranfield University, Centre for \nEcology and Hydrology, Macaulay Institute), where a peer group of scientists within each \norganisation independently assigned scores to each potential biological indicator \naccording to the project specification. A single score for each indicator:criterion \ncombination was then determined using the arithmetic mean score where two or three of \nthe scores were congruent between organisations; where the scores from each \norganisation were all different, the scores were debated verbally to reach a consensual \nvalue. The resultant scores were then transformed according to the following formulae: \nFSF = SFF * SEI * SHB      (1) \nwhere: \nFSF = soil function factor \nSFF = score for food fibre production  \nSEI = score for environmental interactions \n9 \nSHB = score for habitats and biodiversity \n \n \nFAD = SA * SD * FSF     (2) \nwhere: \nFAD = applicability\/discrimination factor \nSA = score for applicability \nSD = score for discrimination \n \n \nFT =  (SCi * WCi) \u2026 + \u2026 (SCn * WCn)  (3) \u2211\n=\nn\ni 1\n \nwhere: \nFT = technical factor \nSCi = score for method category i \nWCi = weighting value for technical category i \nn = number of technical categories \n \n \nFA = FAD * FT      (4) \n10 \nwhere: \nFA = aggregated factor \n \nThis structure operates such that if FSF or FAD is zero, then the indicator under \nconsideration is excluded (\u201csieved\u201d) from subsequent tiers. Similarly, if technical \nweighting is zero, this criterion is excluded from contributing to FT and FA. FT is a \nweighted sum since it contains many categories that are assigned different priorities \naccording to the needs of the end-user. In principle, FSF and FAD could be similarly \nweighted but we did not deem this necessary for the purposes of this study. FA is \nessentially a form of \u201cintegrated prioritisation\u201d that aims to accommodate all information \non an indicator. There is an implicit hierarchy in the tiers, i.e. pertinence to soil functions \ntakes top priority, since if the indicator is not pertinent it should be excluded at the outset. \nThe scoring values and aggregation functions were designed such that higher scores \nrelate to positive attributes from the user\u2019s perspective, i.e. \u201cmore appropriate\u201d or \u201cmore \neffective\u201d \nThe data and algorithms that underwrite the logical sieve were incorporated into a \ndatabase in Microsoft Excel that enabled a high degree of flexibility in terms of data \npopulation, exploring resultant scores and producing numerically ranked lists for any of \nthe individual or aggregated factor scores. \n2.3. Consultative processes \nThe overall approach was reviewed by an international peer-group of soil biologists who \nresponded to a series of questions addressing the scientific and technical categories, the \nweightings and the full list of biological indicators included in the sieve. Following the \n11 \nprimary phase of scoring, a consultative workshop was carried out with a further peer-\ngroup of soil biologists from the UK and members of the UKSIC. \n12 \n3. Results \n3.1. Scoring of potential biological indicators \nA total of 183 potential biological indicators were identified from the literature and \nassessed using the logical sieve framework. These indicators are listed alphabetically in \nTable S1 (Supplementary Material). The scoring assessment involved some 10,000 \nseparate expert decisions. This was not as onerous as would initially appear since the way \nthe sieve was structured, the assessors were able; to scan within and between aggregated \nindicators or criteria. In the first iteration, most scores were similar between the different \nscoring groups with completely dissimilar scores only occurring in 4% of the total \nindicator: criterion cases. The process ensured that, by the final iteration, all decisions \nwere agreed within the core-group (viz. the authors of this paper). The consultative \nprocesses carried out also helped in refining the final framework.  \n3.2. Technical weighting factors \nThe final weights adopted, following respondents' responses to the weighting \nconsultation, are shown in Table 5. The values reflect the relative importance of the \nindividual criteria across the entire stakeholder group. For example, the cost of hardware \ninvolved in the measurement of the indicators was generally perceived as being of little \nsignificance, whilst reproducibility of measures was generally perceived as being of \nparticular importance. There was a range in values assigned between respondents, with \nthe final values arrived at by a process of debate and attention to ultimate end-user \njudgements \u2013 for example, \u2018cost\u2019 was strongly weighted by policy-advice based \nrespondents. This was a pragmatic solution to the challenge of integrating views from a \nstakeholder consultation involving both research scientists and members of public-bodies.  \n13 \nDeployment status was considered a useful variable to potentially explore indicators \nwhich were currently available against those which might in the future be possible, and \nwas weighted zero to prevent it from contributing initially to the FT or FA scores.  \n3.3. Consolidating the ranked lists \nThe framework enables the collation of indicators to be ranked according to the scores of \nany of the categories, or the derived criteria. As would be expected, the rank order of the \nindicators varied according to which category was considered. In terms of the \noverarching aim of the application of the framework for this study, the aggregated factor \n(FA) is most pertinent. The full list of all assessed indicators ranked according to FA is \ngiven in Table S2 (Supplementary Material). This first-order output highlights a degree \nof repetitiveness in the indicators, arising from different methodological approaches for \nassessing the same ecological properties or processes. This also highlights an area of \ninconsistency in the general scientific approach to indicators with the term biological \nindicator being applied to either the methods or the individual parameter of interest, but \nrarely both. We advocate that indicators are identified by both the parameter of interest \nand the method, since scientific comparability and consistency depend on having both \npieces of information.  \nTo produce a consolidated list fit for application, the primary output needed further \nrefining. To this end, those indicators scored with deployment status of 2 (fully \ndeployable) and an FA value of greater than 100, were extracted and each indicator was \nconsidered in turn moving down the FA rank. If the indicator was unique, in terms of the \necological property or process measured in comparison to any indicators thus far \nselected, it was transferred to a consolidated list, but if it was repetitive, i.e. the biological \nproperty was already covered by a previous (higher-ranking) indicator, it was passed \n14 \nover. If there were secondary reasons why the indicator was deemed inappropriate, it was \nalso rejected from the consolidated list. This procedure was repeated until all indicators \nwith FA scores of greater than 100 had been considered, producing a consolidated list of \nthe top-ranking biological indicators with respect to an aggregate score across all soil \nfunctions, which was further aggregated according to deployment status (Table 6). The \nprocedure resulted in thirteen indicators with 'ready for deployment' status, four deemed \nlikely to be ready for deployment in the short-term, and a further four deemed not ready \nfor deployment, with notionally some years development still needed. The logical sieve \nwas further adapted to repeat the above consolidation exercise with respect to each of the \nthree soil functions considered, by weighting to one (unity) the other two soils functions \nnot being considered. These lists are given in the Tables S3-5 in Supplementary Material, \nand demonstrate that whilst there were often many indicators common to more than one \nfunction, others were more appropriate to specific functions. \n4. Discussion \n4.1. 'Logical sieve' approach \nAlthough the framework is rigorous in its structure, pragmatism is needed to achieve a \nfinal useful output. It must be stressed that the logical sieve was designed to act as a \nstructured decision-support tool to assist in formulating a ranked list of indicators, and is \nnot an unequivocal and definitive list \u2013 the issues are far too complex for such rigidity to \nbe appropriate. Genotypic, phenotypic and functional categories of indicator were all \nrepresented in the consolidated list, with genetic analyses predominating, partly reflecting \nrecent advances in molecular techniques. It was notable that only one indicator \n(ammonium-oxidiser population structure by cloning and sequencing) was discarded on \nthe basis of secondary considerations (that of throughput limitations, and that it was \n15 \neffectively included by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism- (TRFLP-) \nbased approaches which ranked adjacent in the first output). This suggests the robustness \nof the logical sieve approach in that it also matched the \u201cintuitive\u201d consensus of both the \nproject group and the consultees. Whilst there is an implicit ranking within these lists, the \nrelative positions of the different indicators should not be over-interpreted. The point is \nthat these indicators have been identified by an objective process.  \nThe logical sieve allows the agreed database to be interrogated in a number of ways, \nreflecting the priorities of different users. It provides an auditable trail of how indicators \nwere identified in terms of their respective priorities. It is also flexible and can be readily \napplied to scenarios other than those we adopted here; for example, it may be an \nindividual, group or agency requires that any samples taken must be conducive to being \narchived, and could use this property as a primary sieve criterion. The sieve inputs may \nbe updated as new techniques emerge, or by amendment as existing techniques are \nmodified and improved. This basic framework could also be widely adopted for any class \nof environmental quality analysis reliant on a number of potential indicators for example \nplant species and dynamics. \n4.2. Gap analysis \nThe robustness of the approach, and the appropriateness of the top-ranking indicators, can \nbe checked by cross-referencing each of the three key soil functions prescribed at the \noutset. This simplified process confirms a generally comprehensive coverage of \necological properties and processes, and especially when the biological indicators are \ntaken as a complete suite (Table 7). All functions, with the exception of N fixation, have \nat least one representation by an indicator, and the majority at least three. \nTolerance\/resistance to toxins and biodiversity are most represented. The latter would be \n16 \nexpected given the inherent nature of most biological indicators, and the former \ndemonstrates why biotic indicators play key roles in ecotoxicology. The added value of \nthis stage is that, if considered important, it is possible to go back to the framework and \nidentify the most appropriate indicators to fill any gaps.  \n4.3. Candidate biological indicators  \n4.3.1. Soil microbial taxa and community structure using TRFLP techniques  \nSeveral nucleic-acid methods scored highly in the final rankings since they relate directly \nto microbial diversity and function. They also have many practical advantages, in terms \nof archivability, high-throughput and potential transferability of data. In this context, \nanalysis via TRFLP was considered the most appropriate since it is currently deployable. \nThis circumstance will undoubtedly change with the advent of ever higher-resolution, \nfaster and cheaper sequencing technologies. This is why gene arrays are included in the \nfinal list but under Deployment Status 0. This notwithstanding, further work is required \nto identify the most suitable primers and optimise the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), \nrestriction and fingerprinting steps for the identified organismal groups. It is also notable \nthat the methods, including different primers, have not yet been coherently applied to a \nwide range of soil types and consequently there is no systematic understanding of \ndiscrimination potential and sensitivity to large-scale spatial and temporal variation.  \n4.3.2. Soil microbial community structure and biomass from PLFAs \nThe use of extracted lipids, in particular phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), as signature \nlipid biomarkers, has become widely used to study soil microbial communities (Zelles \n1999). The total PLFA content is indicative of the total viable biomass and individual \nPLFAs, or suites thereof, can be related to community structure as they are found \npredominantly (but not exclusively) in distinct groups (e.g. fungi, bacteria, Gram-\n17 \nnegative bacteria, actinomycetes). The main advantage of PLFA profiling is that it is a \nsemi-quantitative method, does not rely on cultivability and provides wide coverage of \nthe soil microbial community. Such biochemical phenotypic profiling is arguably \nparticularly suited to monitoring contexts since by definition it integrates the genotype \nwith the environment. It also has the virtue of not relying on a \u2018species concept\u2019 which \nconfounds soil ecology due to the prevalent extreme levels of genetic diversity, and the \nlack of simple relationships between taxonomic status and functional traits in most soil \nmicrobial communities. Although PLFA analysis has been widely used, as with most \nmethods, there has been no systematic study of the full range of soil types that might be \ncovered by a soil monitoring exercise. \n4.3.3. Soil respiration and C cycling from multiple substrate induced respiration  \nCarbon cycling is fundamental to soil function and the respiration of CO2 from soils, \narising from community-level biotic activity, is an intrinsic indicator of C cycling. \nMeasurement of this property in isolation does not provide useful discrimination, and \nhence ranked low in the logical sieve. However, assays of C mineralisation that put the \nbasal respiration rate into a wider context are considerably more powerful. The concept \nunderlying the multiple substrate-induced respiration (MSIR) approach is to characterise \nhow a soil community responds to exposure to a range of carbon substrates of differing \nchemical status (Degens and Harris 1997). Respiration determination by use of gas \nchromatograph is feasible to determine MSIR profiles but is laborious, restricting \npotential throughput of samples, and unlikely to be feasible for large-scale soil \nmonitoring. There is potential to achieve high throughput systems, for example by \napplication of the MicroRespTM system (Campbell et al. 2003), but this has yet to be \nrigorously tested across a wide range of land uses and soil types.  \n18 \n4.3.4. Biochemical processes from multi-enzyme profiling \nBiochemical reactions in soils are mediated by enzymes produced by the soil biota as part \nof their metabolic machinery. There is a plethora of enzymes that can be profiled, relating \nto virtually any defined biochemical transformation, with enzyme activity rates \ntransferable between studies.(Burns and Dick 2002). Many individual enzymes were \nconsidered in the logical sieve framework, but ranked lower than the multiple enzyme \nfluorometric approach since this assay can inform on several ecological processes within \na single assay. An increasingly wide range of fluorescently-labelled substrates are \navailable which enable sensitive measurements to be made on small samples, permitting \nhigh-throughput assay systems (Marx et al. 2001). This method is suited primarily to \nenzymes involved in C-cycling, since the majority of fluorescently labelled substrates \navailable target C-transforming enzymes. However, fluorescently labelled substrates that \nrelate to phosphatase and sulphatase are also commercially available, and others may \nenter the market over time.  \n4.3.5. Nematodes  \nNematodes are among the most abundant multi-cellular soil organisms and their potential \nas biological indicators of soil quality is already widely reported; several such indicators \nhave been proposed from nematode taxa and community structures e.g. (Mulder et al. \n2005). The most widely adopted is the Maturity Index (MI) which reflects the distribution \nof nematodes across functional groups (Bongers 1990). More amenable indicators are the \ntotal number of nematode taxa and abundance of individual functional groups. In contrast \nto the biochemically-orientated techniques for microbial characterisation, identification \nof nematodes, even to functional groups, relies on highly trained experts. Nucleic acid \n19 \ntechniques to characterise nematode community structure are emerging (Donn et al. \n2008) and have potential to reduce this reliance as well as increase throughput. \n4.3.6. Microarthropods  \nThis group, in particular acari (mites) and collembola (springtails), are amongst the most \nnumerous and widespread soil invertebrates in British soils. Both have been proposed as \nreliable biological indicators however some consideration is required to determine which \nmetrics show the greatest discrimination between soil:land use combinations and \nsensitivity to environmental pressures and drivers (Parisi et al. 2005). With both groups, \nthe enumeration from dry extraction is fairly straight-forward although higher levels of \nidentification require expert skills and reliable keys for identification.  \n4.3.7. On-site visual recording of soil fauna and flora \nThis method (as a combination of different potential indicators) scored highly as it is one \nof the few approaches that could be used with relative ease to assess the presence of key \ngroups of soil organisms that would otherwise be under-represented, namely ants, fungal \nfruiting bodies and earthworms (via casts). Truly reliable on-site recording does however \nrequire a consistent set of methodologies which have not yet been developed for the UK \nenvironment (Swift and Bignell 2001). \n4.3.8. Pitfall traps for ground-dwelling and soil invertebrates \nThere is a substantial body of literature on the use of pitfall traps to assess ground-\ndwelling and soil invertebrates and the value of these invertebrates as biological \nindicators (Eyre 2006). Pitfall traps are a well-established technique and have been \nwidely used for environmental surveillance. A disadvantage is this method requires return \n20 \nvisits to a sampling site (e.g. 2 weeks after deployment) which maybe impractical for a \nnational-scale soil monitoring scheme.  \n4.4. Microbial biomass \nThe total quantity of life belowground obviously underpins any biologically-related \nproperty of soil systems, and is of great significance in many contexts. In almost all \ncircumstances, the majority of the soil biomass is of microbial scale, and hence the \nmicrobial biomass intuitively represents a key property of soils in a monitoring context. It \nwas notable that in all instances, biomass per se did not enter the upper ranks of the sieve. \nThis was largely due to lower scores associated with the lack of discrimination that gross \nbiomass measures provide in an ecological context. They are all-encompassing (\u2018black-\nbox\u2019) measures that have an undoubted direct pertinence to pool sizes in nutrient cycling, \nprincipally carbon, but are less informative in other contexts. The same argument applies \nto basal respiration. However, this is not to assert that these properties have no validity! \nIn the broadest context, these concomitantly broad measures do have roles to play in \nmonitoring contexts, arguably providing the fundamental baseline and of greatest value \ntaken in combination with other higher-resolution measures. It is notable also that certain \nof the top-ranking indicators inherently include biomass measurements, viz. MSIR carries \na zero-substrate and glucose-induced respiration measurement, encompassing both basal \nrespiration and biomass; and PLFA can be used as a surrogate biomass measure if \nappropriate control measures are used in the assay.  \n5. Conclusions \nThe selection of a candidate suite of biological indicators is only the first stage towards \ndeployment in national-scale soil monitoring. Following the principles established by \n(Doran and Zeiss 2000), we need to establish how these indicators are sensitive to \n21 \nvariations in management, correlated with soil functions and can be used to elucidate \nspecific ecological processes. There remains considerable uncertainty over the reliability \nof these indicators over landscape spatial scales and within and between seasons for use \nacross the UK environment. Method development is required to establish standard \noperating procedures (SOPs) that would ensure reproducibility of results and resolve \npractical issues, including cost-effectiveness, for monitoring purposes. There may also be \nsurrogacy between indicators that is not yet apparent since sufficiently coherent datasets \nare not yet available. This lack of coherence in data and SOPs is a significant issue that \nthwarts attempts to integrate published data to elucidate discrimination and sensitivity \npotential for assays. Alongside these issues, effort is required to ensure that the \ninformation derived from national-scale soil monitoring will be comprehensible and \nuseful to the end-users, such as land managers and policy-makers. If this information is to \nbe used as an \u201cearly-warning\u201d, as proposed in so-called Tier 1 monitoring, then we need \nto identify the observed ranges and envelopes of acceptability for values from the \nindividual indicators in different land uses or ecosystems, and establish whether \ndeviations from these \u201cenvelopes\u201d are a sign of beneficial or detrimental changes to \necological processes or properties and the likely consequences for soil functions.  \nAcknowledgements \nThe work was funded by the UK Department of Environment, Food and Regional Affairs \n(Defra).
