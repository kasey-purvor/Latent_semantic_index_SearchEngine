Introduction\nTissue sca\ufb00olds are designed to provide temporary,\ndegradable matrices for supporting cells to grow new, func-\ntional living tissue. The materials from which such sca\ufb00olds\nare manufactured range from hard inorganic materials,\nsuch as hydroxyapatite, to highly hydrated gel-like materi-\nals, depending on the intended application. Sca\ufb00old mate-\nrials can be either synthetic or biologically derived. Whilst\nsynthetic materials can be manufactured with predictable\nand reproducible chemical, mechanical and physical char-\nacteristics, they may elicit unexpected biological responses\nwhen in contact with tissues. Hence, there is continuing\ninterest in bioderived materials such as collagen which, as\nnatural interstitial tissue components, provide a viable52\n53\n54\n1742-7061\/$ - see front matter \u0002 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf o\ndoi:10.1016\/j.actbio.2007.10.009\n* Corresponding author.

To date there is no consensus as to which are\nthe \u2018\u2018best\u2019\u2019 materials to use for a particular application,\nwhich structures provide the optimal environment for cell\ngrowth or what are the most appropriate mechanical and\nchemical properties for the cell microenvironment.\nUnderstanding the basic structure of complex tissue\nsca\ufb00olds has proved to be challenging, especially for highly\nhydrated soft materials such as gels, together with the\nquantitative determination of how these structures degrade\nwith time. The latter is key to the development for optimiz-\ning sca\ufb00old designs based on biodegradable materials.\nIndeed, many of the commonly used structural evaluation\ntools, such as X-ray micro-computer tomography [3\u20135],\nmercury porosimetry [4] and capillary \ufb02ow porometry, can-\nnot be used on gel-like materials due to their softness or\nlack of contrast.

A fea-\nsible procedure used to investigate the structure of gels is\nneutron scattering, which enables analysis under near-\nphysiological conditions and thus allows a hydrated gel\nto be examined [6,7]. However, this cannot be classed as\na routine method due to the availability of equipment\nrequired for the analysis.\nA more pragmatic approach to characterizing gels is to\nmeasure the di\ufb00usivity of molecular probes through the\nmaterial as a function of di\ufb00erent environmental condi-\ntions and time. This approach has been recently explored\nusing cyclic voltammetry and shown to be a viable non-\ninvasive method [8].\nIn this paper we have extended this study to investigate\ndi\ufb00erent sample cells for monitoring probe di\ufb00usion\nthrough sca\ufb00old materials and to explore the e\ufb00ect that\naccelerated degradation has on in vitro permeability. The\nmaterial used is a commercially available collagen-based\nmaterial used as a dermal substitute. Collagen-based matri-\nces are materials commonly used for skin, connective tissue\nand peripheral nerve tissue engineering applications [1,2].\nThese materials have an obvious physiological advantage\nover synthetic polymers, given their derivation from natu-\nral tissue. The relationship between the initial structure\nand the degradation performance over time is key to the\nsuccess of the sca\ufb00old. Understanding the kinetics of deg-\nradation in a cell-seeded sca\ufb00old is by no means intuitive\nas there are many key factors that need to be considered\nin a passive, i.e. non-mechanically stimulated, system,\nincluding the presence of extracellular matrix, changes in\nthe structure of the material, the cell density and perfusion\ncharacteristics, and the concentration of relevant enzymes.\nThis was understood in the development of collagen-based\ntissue engineering sca\ufb00olds [9]. More recently, Jarman-\nSmith et al. [10] have demonstrated that heavily cross-\nlinked porcine dermal collagen was very resistant to colla-\ngenases, but was also impenetrable to dermal \ufb01broblasts,\nand thus cellular in\ufb01ltration of such sca\ufb00olds will not\noccur. Harley et al. [11], using collagen guide chambers\nas conduits for nerve regeneration, showed that increasing\nthe cross-link density within the collagen decreased the\ndegradation rate and that nerve regeneration quality\nreached an optimum at a degradation rate which gave a\nchamber half-life of 2\u20133 weeks in vivo. Similarly, Gordon\net al. [12] suggested that chondrocytes growing in fast\ndegrading collagen sca\ufb00olds grew less well than in those\ndegrading less quickly. These authors did, however, suggest\nthat some uncoupling of sca\ufb00old degradation and tissue\nregeneration may occur.\nDegradation of collagen-based sca\ufb00olds in vivo is likely\nto be due to a number of physiochemical and biological\ne\ufb00ects. In particular, the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-\n8 (neutrophil collagenase) is likely to play a dominant role.\nVan Amerongen et al. [13] have shown that a collagen scaf-\nfold used in the experimental reconstruction of murine\nmyocardium becomes surrounded by neutrophils at about\nday 14 in vivo, and that MMP-8 co-localizes with the neu-Please cite this article in press as: Willows A et al., Assessment\ndoi:10.1016\/j.actbio.2007.10.009E\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\ntrophils, suggesting that much of the collagen degradation\nis enzymic. Exposure to ultraviolet or gamma radiation is a\ncommonly used method in medicine for sterilizing materi-\nals. Indeed, this is often the only route for sterilizing mate-\nrials that are thermally sensitive and contain signi\ufb01cant\namounts of water. This approach has a drawback in that\nradiation exposure can lead to chain scission or cross-link-\ning of polymers [14,15]. The former e\ufb00ect has been well-\ndocumented for medically relevant materials such as poly(-\nmethyl methacrylate) and polyethylene, but less well so for\nnatural materials such as collagen [16,17]. Radiation can\ninduce structural changes in materials that may impact\non their performance, i.e. mechanical properties enhanced\nthrough cross-linking or reduced by chain scission.\nVarious approaches have been used to accelerate degra-\ndation of naturally occurring polymers; Pek et al. [18]\nreported the use of enzymes such as collagenase and chon-\ndroitinase to degrade a collagen\u2013glycosaminoglycan (C-\nGAG) skin substitute. Holy et al. [19] used pH change as\na means of accelerating the rate of degradation in PLGA\n(poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) sca\ufb00olds. Their results show\nthat the rate of degradation of PLGA increased at lower\npH, although this was not quanti\ufb01ed.\nDetermination of sca\ufb00old degradation is most com-\nmonly accomplished using histological, immunocytochem-\nical or other ultrastructural methods [18,20], but this is\npoorly quanti\ufb01able, prompting the current study. In this\npaper we have used cyclic voltammetry to study changes\nin the di\ufb00usion behaviour of ferri\/ferrocyanide through\ncollagen-based sca\ufb00olds that have been subjected to di\ufb00er-\nent doses of gamma radiation followed by accelerated age-\ning at elevated temperatures or in the presence of enzymes\n(collagenase) or at di\ufb00erent pHs.2.

Cyclic voltammetry\nIn a recent study [8] we developed the use of a small mol-\necule redox couple, ferri\/ferrocyanide, as a probe for di\ufb00u-\nsion characterization. Ferri\/ferrocyanide is a classical,\nreversible molecular probe used in conventional electro-\nchemistry as a basis for characterizing di\ufb00usion reactions\nat electrode surfaces. Such measurements can be used to\ndetermine the e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient for the molecu-\nlar probe through a porous material. There are many other\nwell-documented redox systems that can be considered as a\nstandard, but the ferri\/ferrocyanide used in this investiga-\ntion [22] is readily monitored using a standard platinum\nelectrode;\nFe\u00f0CN\u00de4\u00026 () Fe\u00f0CN\u00de3\u00026 \u00fe e\u0002; E0 \u00bc \u00fe0:36 V vs NHE\n\u00f01\u00de\nHere the NHE is the normal hydrogen electrode against\nwhich all standard potentials (E0) are related. Under con-\nventional solution conditions, this redox couple has fast\nelectron transfer kinetics and is a simple single electron\nreaction without any additional side reactions, giving rise\nto well-de\ufb01ned single oxidation and reduction peaks during\ncyclic voltammetry [23]. This particular redox couple is\nespecially useful for investigating di\ufb00erent electrode sur-\nfaces as the solution response is already well characterized.\nPotassium ferrocyanide (MW = 422.41), although not\nphysiologically relevant, can be used as a molecular probe\nto assess the porous membrane permeability to microso-\nlutes, as discussed below.\nTwo experimental approaches, shown in Figs. 1 and 2,\nwere used to obtain cyclic voltammograms (CVs). In\nFig. 1 the sample, after rinsing in distilled water and soak-\ning in PBS bu\ufb00er, was placed over a platinum (Pt) working\nelectrode with a Pt wire as counter-electrode and an Ag\/\nAgCl reference both immersed in the bulk solution above\nthe membrane. The single-compartment electrochemical\ncell utilized a commercial measuring chamber, the Rank\ncell (Rank Brothers, Cambridge, UK). The sample was in\ncontact with a 12 mm2 working electrode. Samples were\nimmersed in bu\ufb00er and excess bu\ufb00er was removed before\nadding an aqueous solution of 0.1 M potassium ferrocya-\nnide (K4Fe(CN)6) in PBS at pH 7.4. A software controlled\nlAutolab II (Ecochemie, the Netherlands) potentiostat was\nused to record all voltammetric experiments with potentials\nrecorded with respect to an Ag\/AgCl electrode. Sequential\nrecordings of the CVs were made taking the time at which\nthe sample was exposed to the redox couple as time zero.\nAlternatively, a sample with a diameter of 10 mm was\nused in a two-compartment di\ufb00usion cell shown in Fig. 2.\nHere, the sample was sandwiched between two sheets of\na coarse mesh used for containing gel-like materials in size\nexclusion chromatography columns. The mesh served to\nsupport the sample and helped maintain a uniform thick-\nness. The Pt working electrode was sited in chamber B,\nwhich initially contained only PBS bu\ufb00er.

Sensitivity of cyclic voltammograms to the electrolyte\nsolution\nIn conventional electrochemical experiments the redox\ncouple is dissolved in electrolyte solution, typically potas-\nsium chloride. The presence of the electrolyte ensures that\nsolute ion mass transport due to migration is minimized\nand the e\ufb00ects of the electrode electric \ufb01eld are con\ufb01ned\nto a small distance from the surface. The supporting elec-\ntrolyte needs to be inert in the potential range of the exper-\niment and to carry the current of the electrochemical cell,\nthus minimizing any problems due to solution resistance.\nThe electrolyte concentration in the PBS bu\ufb00er (0.2 M) is\nlower than for the KCl experiments (1 M) and therefore\nthere may be a contribution to the voltammogram from\nan e\ufb00ect due to a di\ufb00erence in the solution resistance.\nFig. 3 shows CVs obtained using the Rank cell shown in\nFig. 1 in the presence of ferrocyanide in PBS and KCl,\nrespectively. The results are typical of a single electron\ntransfer process. The locations of the oxidation and reduc-\ntion peaks are the same (+0.33 V for oxidation peak and\n+0.18 V for the reduction peak) between the two solutions,\nalthough there is a small increase in solution resistance\nwhen using PBS, shown by the increased background cur-\nrent. However, the voltammogram has good shape and\ncurrent amplitude and, since the PBS system is closer to\nthe bu\ufb00er systems used elsewhere in this work, it was used\nfor all electrochemical experiments.\n3.2.

For a reversible reaction, such as\nthat for the redox couple used here, the peak potential\nshould be independent of the scan rate. The peak current\nshould also be proportional to the square root of the scan\nrate. Both sets of voltammograms show that the oxidation\nand reduction peak positions change with the scan rate, so\nthe system has deviated from its reversible characteristic at\nthis electrode surface. Given that an essentially aqueous gel\nphase is in contact with the electrode, further alteration to\nthe redox chemistry due to the gel is highly unlikely. This\nimplies that the di\ufb00erences between the CVs for control\nand gel covered electrodes are due to changes in the di\ufb00u-\nsivity of the electroactive species. Whilst both the oxidation\nand reduction peak heights increase with increasing scan\nrate, if peak height is proportional to the square root of\nthe scan rate, then a threefold increase in peak height\nwould be expected for a scan rate change from 10 to\n100 mV s\u00021. There is, in fact, a loss of this relationship,\ncon\ufb01rming the loss of ideal reversible behaviour. However,\nthe peak height for the control is also approximately twice\nthat of the C-GAG-covered electrode. This is a clear indi-\ncation that the sample retards the di\ufb00usion of ferrocyanide\nto the electrode surface. In order to avoid inconsistencies\ndue to the electrode reaction, all subsequent measurements\nwere made using a standard scan rate of 100 mV s\u00021.\n3.3. Comparison of experimental methods for determining\nCVs\nThe amplitude of the oxidation peak, ip (A), in a cyclic\nvoltammogram is proportion to the bulk concentration\nof the redox couple, C (mol cm\u00023), according to the Ran-\ndles\u2013Sevc\u02c7ik equation [24]\nip \u00bc \u00f02:686\u0003 105\u00den3=2m1=2D1=2AC at 25 \u0004C \u00f02\u00de\nwhere n is the number of electrons involved in the half reac-\ntion, D is the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient for solute migration to\nthe electrode surface (cm2 s\u00021), m is the scan rate (V s\u00021)\nand A is the area of the electrode (cm2).

In practical terms, these reactions and\nion movements during repeat scans take place within a\nboundary layer that extends some 200 nm away from the\nsurface of the working electrode. For most of the experi-\nmental arrangements described here we can therefore\nassume that the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient for the redox couple\nwill be the same as that for an aqueous solution, i.e.\n7.6 \u00b7 10\u00026 cm2 s\u00021 [23].\nFig. 5 shows the time-dependent evolution of CVs\nobtained from both the Rank cell (a) and the di\ufb00usion cell\n(b) during the \ufb01rst few minutes of exposing the C-GAG\nmembrane to the redox couple. The amplitude of the cur-\nrent is much less in the di\ufb00usion cell system than in the\nRank cell system, in fact by an order of magnitude. As\nthe working electrodes used were matched for area, this dif-\nference must be due to the dilution of the redox couple by\nthe bu\ufb00er in chamber B. A practical consequence of these\nvery weak currents is that data obtained at times below\napproximately 250 s were prone to excessive noise. The\ndilution problem could be overcome by doubling the con-\ncentration of ferrocyanide in the di\ufb00usion cell, but this\nwould complicate comparisons of the two approaches\nthrough ionic strength e\ufb00ects in both the gels and the elec-\ntrochemical reaction. Using a di\ufb00usion cell that contains\nsmaller volumes of solution would also not readily solve\nthe problem since proper sample immersion would be di\ufb03-\ncult. For this reason, the Rank cell method is more suitable\nfor measuring solute di\ufb00usion through the C-GAG mem-\nbrane, allowing lower probe solute concentrations to be\nutilized.\nThe time-dependent increase in the amplitude of the oxi-\ndation peak provides a direct route to monitoring the\nchange in concentration of the redox couple in the immedi-\nate vicinity of the working electrode in line with Eq. (2).\nFig. 6 shows a comparison of measurements obtained from\nthe Rank cell system and the di\ufb00usion cell.

Corresponding measurements made usingthe di\ufb00usion cell show an almost linear increase in inten-\nsity, although, as previously stated, the oxidative peak cur-\nrent in the di\ufb00usion cell is lower than that measured in the\nRank cell.\nAccording to the Randles\u2013Sevc\u02c7ik function, Eq. (2), any\nchanges in the peak current, ip, for a given experimental\nsystem are proportional to the concentration of the redox\ncouple, the area of the working electrode and the di\ufb00usion\ncoe\ufb03cient of oxidizable molecules in the immediate vicinity\nof the working electrode. We therefore would expect a pro-\ngressive increase in ip with time for both experimental\narrangements due to di\ufb00usion of the ferrocyanide though\nthe C-GAG samples. Whilst this is the case for the di\ufb00usion\ncell data, it appears not to be so for the Rank cell. This sug-\ngests that some change in the local environment of the\nworking electrode occurs; one likely explanation is that\nthe C-GAG may collapse over time, forming a denser bar-\nrier layer that resists solute transport.\nFig. 7 shows a schematic representation of the di\ufb00usion\nof the redox couple through the C-GAG membrane and\nactivity at the working electrode. The concentration ofPlease cite this article in press as: Willows A et al., Assessment\ndoi:10.1016\/j.actbio.2007.10.009redox couple in the PBS bu\ufb00er will increase with time\ndue to di\ufb00usion across the C-GAG membrane. This will\nbe detected by a change in the concentration of the redox\ncouple very close to the electrode surface, potentially in a\nthin electrolyte \ufb01lm between the electrode and the C-\nGAG layer. The oxidation\/reduction processes that give\nrise to the CVs occur within this narrow distance, and\ntherefore the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient of the redox couple will\nbe independent of the presence of a sample, i.e. changes\nin ip are simply proportional to changes in the concentra-\ntion of redox couple in this interfacial zone. Assuming this\nis the case, the experimental arrangement can be used as a\nmeans of gauging the \ufb02ux of ferrocyanide through the gel\nmembrane, with the external bulk solution concentration\nessentially unchanged.\nBy contrast, it is important to note that the concentra-\ntion of the electroactive species in chamber A of the di\ufb00u-\nsion cell changes signi\ufb01cantly with time, since a large\nvolume of bu\ufb00er is contained in chamber B.

A further practical con-\nsideration is that the two-compartment di\ufb00usion cell\nhas to be \ufb01lled with \ufb02uid at the same rate in each cham-\nber to avoid \ufb02ow due to pressure di\ufb00erences. Ferrocya-\nnide transfer across the membrane (Fig. 1) also reduces\nthe magnitude of the di\ufb00usion gradient between the\ntwo chambers.\nIn the single-compartment Rank cell, the sample is sited\ndirectly over the working electrode and, while this mini-\nmizes the volume of bu\ufb00er sampled, the volume of solution\ncontaining electroactive species above the sample is also\nlow (1 cm3) to minimize the pressure acting on the sample.\nThis relatively small volume of solution could easily\nbecome diluted with bu\ufb00er volume already contained\nwithin the sample and this, together with gel swelling or\ncompression, could in\ufb02uence the reproducibility and accu-\nracy of quantitative measurements based on CVs. Further-\nmore, the system may be susceptible to greater electrode\nsurface fouling, i.e. the functional area of the working elec-\ntrode may be reduced through intimate contact with the\nsample or through protein adsorption.\nExposure to radiation and storage under di\ufb00erent envi-\nronments that are designed to accelerate the rate of degra-\ndation of the C-GAG matrix can in principle produce a\nsigni\ufb01cant change in the structure of a material. Exposure\nof the native material to di\ufb00erent doses of radiation\nappears to stabilize the initial structure, though no dose-\nor temperature-correlated e\ufb00ects were seen. Exposure of\nthe material to collagenase had signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ects on the\nstructure, converting the sheet-like domains into \ufb01brous\nmeshes with a tendency to increased permeability. This\ncontrasts with the marked evidence of structural collapse\nat pH 5.

This\nincreased permeability is independent of the measurement\ntime and incubation time, suggesting that the treated\nhydrogels are much more permeable than the native\nmaterial.\nStoring irradiated samples in an acidic environment (pH\n5) or in a solution containing \ufb01brinogen has a signi\ufb01cant\ne\ufb00ect on measured CVs, reducing the oxidation peak cur-\nrent to very low levels. This behaviour might be explained\nby collapse of the sample onto the working electrode sur-\nface (pH 5 storage).5. Conclusions\nAn electrochemical redox probe allowed investigation of\nthe change in permeability of a collagen\u2013glycosaminogly-\ncan dermal equivalent matrix due to various degradation\nconditions. Collagenase-treated C-GAG samples show a\nchange in structure and increased permeability. Storing\nirradiated samples in an acidic environment (pH 5) or with\n\ufb01brinogen appears to cause a degree of collapse within the\nstructure and decreases permeability. These factors should\nbe taken into account during sterilization and storage of\nthe dermal equivalent matrix.Acknowledgements\nWe thank Jaroslaw Wasikiewicz, of Queen Mary, Uni-\nversity of London, for experimental assistance.
