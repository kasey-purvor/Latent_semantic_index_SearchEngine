Published anecdotal comments inspired by the wide array of\navatar shapes and affordances suggest instructors share a range of attitudes about their use.\nFor example, one instructor at the University of Toronto reported a disquieting inability to\nread the body language of students\u2019 avatars in his virtual classroom (Graves 2008), while\nan instructor from Harvard University perceived outrageous avatars in her classroom as\nevidence of students enjoying the opportunity to bring their own personality into discus-\nsions (Lamont 2007). These two perspectives are representative of the disparate opinions\ninstructors hold as they consider the use of IVWs in their teaching.\nFor the uninitiated, a participant new to the Second Life environment will choose the\nbody dimensions and clothing for an interactive avatar prior to attending an online class\nsession. Once oriented, it takes knowledge and in-world currency to find and purchase\nspecialised clothing and other adornments or tools. In fact, participants can purchase refine-\nments to the physical shape of their avatar choosing from potentially distracting forms such\nas gelatinous blobs or hovering stacks of discs. Clothing choices for avatars can include\nfeathers or exotic costumes and tools such as jet packs. It is even possible for a student to\narrive in a virtual classroom environment with shimmering fields of light as an adornment.\n*Email: mmcvey@emich.edu\n174  M. Hamilton McVey\nA participant new to the virtual world without resources or general expertise will have\nan avatar garbed only in the most basic of costumes and relatively free of refinements.\nExpert users of the IVW will be able to access the profiles of new participants and note an\nabsence of memberships to in-world organisations and sparse inventories of virtual objects.\nTheir lack of adornment indicates, to those experienced with Second Life, a general lack of\nknowledge and resources. Thus, the construction and maintenance of the avatar has the\npotential for becoming an identifier of knowledge, status, and even authority. Such visual\nidentifiers extend to observations of the avatars\u2019 physical negotiation around objects,\nteleportation across and between virtual environments, and even the social interactions\nbetween avatars.\nIn a teaching situation or as part of an online community of practice, an instructor may\ndisplay, through the intermediary of the avatar, an attitude of subject-matter expertise\nthrough the proper use of social conventions, choice of avatar costume or enhancements,\ndisplays of inventory, knowledge of movement and flight, control of mannerisms and\ngestures, and a detailed profile with connections to many groups. Even an absence of clum-\nsiness in movement can be indicative of an expertise with the conventions of an immersive\nvirtual world.\nIt is unclear if instructors possessing such a skill set can use these synchronous commu-\nnication skills to set the tone in a virtual teaching situation. It is also unclear whether avatar\nadornments or affordances are necessary to demonstrate the instructor\u2019s content area\nmastery.\nBackground\nForms of communication in online learning environments gather into two distinct types: real\ntime or synchronous, and delayed or asynchronous. Research favouring asynchronous\ncommunication in an online learning environment suggests that computer-mediated commu-\nnication through tools such as discussion lists or threaded discussions can benefit students\nnormally shy or reticent to speak aloud in class (Kelley and Keaten 2007). Davidson-Shivers,\nTanner, and Muilenburg (2000) compared the qualities of online synchronous and asynchro-\nnous discourse to determine whether one discussion environment produced more content-\nrelated participation than the others. They concluded that synchronous communication\nprovided a direct, immediate environment for responses; however, asynchronous communi-\ncation, examined through discussion list responses, was delayed but more focused and\npurposeful. Such a difference might result from students having more time to think about\ntheir responses in an asynchronous setting. Increased thinking time improves the depth and\nquality of responses (Tallent-Runnels et al. 2006). The reliance on synchronous communi-\ncation in Second Life and other IVWs might suggest some pedagogical inefficiency in formal\nlearning settings.\nOne of the benefits of engaging students in synchronous communication environments\nwould be what some researchers refer to as the creation of a community of practice (Wenger\n1998). Although not a new invention or construction, the concept of a community of prac-\ntice has taken some interesting turns since practitioners can interact and develop their ability\nto know and learn through electronic means. Since the mid-1980s, discussion lists and elec-\ntronic bulletin boards enabled text-based interactions, both synchronous and asynchronous\nand both with and without moderation. Researchers such as Winograd (2000) explored the\neffect of a moderator on online conferences, developing a theory that even a low degree of\nmoderation allowed a group to form a community. These communities are defined in terms\nof camaraderie, support, and warmth.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   175\nSince computer-mediated communication democratises online learning environments\n(DiMattteo 1990; Rheingold 1993), all learners have the opportunity to participate and\ncontribute. Investigation into how such communities work effectively without external\norganising or moderation has been hampered by the short-term nature of previous research\non online learning communities (Tu and Corry 2002). Primarily, studies have examined\nend-product messages where the nature of contributions is determined through a close read-\ning of the posts and a derived understanding of their authorship. Even with such limitations,\nanalysis of discourse through end-product messages has demonstrated that effective online\ncommunities include contributions ranging from descriptions and humour to articulation\nand clarification (Chapman, Ramondt, and Smiley 2005).\nIt is through these social interactions in online communities that participants display\nsubject matter expertise through writing skills that display sensitivity, compassion, and\ninspiration (McVey 2008). Without a lengthy association with an online community to\ndetermine who among members of the community has expertise, participants must find\nother ways to identify degrees of expertise. In the complex environment of the IVW, exper-\ntise can be determined through surface adornments, augmentative devices, and navigation\nskills of avatars. These reflections of expertise do not necessary convey content expertise\nbut rather communication platform expertise. Newcomers to the virtual world easily recog-\nnise these outward displays as signs of a skill set peculiar to the IVW. It is unclear whether\ninstructors who wish to teach within a virtual environment should develop their avatars to\ndisplay evidence of platform expertise.\nResearch about the interactions among participants in a text-based online community of\npractice suggest that instructors establish groups early, model and reinforce effective\ncommunication, identify potential problems, and design plans for dealing with these poten-\ntial problems (Tallent-Runnels et al. 2006). Bielman, Putney, and Strudler (2003) also\nreviewed the construction of a text-based online community and noted that learners\nincluded \u2018emoticons\u2019 such as smiley faces in online communications with one another in an\neffort to compensate for the missing visual and non-verbal communication cues.\nBenefits of engaging in synchronous communications include holding virtual office\nhours, team decision-making, brainstorming, community building, and dealing with techni-\ncal issues (Branon and Essex 2001). While synchronous discussions may be more difficult\nto implement than asynchronous discussions, noted benefits include a greater sense of\npresence and generating spontaneity (Hines and Pearl 2004).\nSynchronous instruction, such as that which occurs in IVWs, requires the simultaneous\nparticipation of students and teacher (Romiszowski and Mason 2004). As noted earlier,\nIVWs are, for the most part, synchronous with a few exceptions being signage and messages\non display. The design and architecture found in the IVW itself is a form of asynchronous\ncommunication that might serve to encourage and invite one response over another. Direc-\ntions, visual cues, pathways and colour choices are examples of decisions the architects of\ninteractive environments make which communicate important information, values, and\nattitudes to the participants. The same communication of values and attitudes can be\nencountered through the social conventions and mannerisms of avatars as part of the\ncomplex interactivity taking place inside the IVW.\nIn an IVW, participants engage in mannerisms and social conventions to convey their\nlevels of expertise either with the content or the platform, but what it is unclear is the impact\nthese conventions have, if any, on interactions between learners and instructors or facilita-\ntors. Observing the social conventions experts display that aid in reducing frustration or\nassist in enhancing communication might have implications for instructors hoping to hold\nsynchronous sessions in an IVW.\n176  M. Hamilton McVey\nMethodology\nResearch question\nWhat aspects of avatar construction or social interaction do participants new to IVWs\nassociate with experienced participants?\nSubjects in this qualitative study were graduate students taking an online elective course\nas part of an Educational Media and Technology programme at an American mid-western\nuniversity. Most were currently working as K-12 classroom teachers and were competent in\nusing technology. Despite a strong interest in technology, most had not experienced an\nimmersive virtual world before but were able to create an avatar and participate in the basic\norientation with no intervention on the part of the instructor.\nTwo groups of five students each participated in an online tour of Second Life in which\nthey were to navigate, with their instructor\u2019s avatar, to predetermined locations including\nreplicas of the Sistine Chapel, Tranquillity Base on the Moon, the Globe Theatre, and an\naquarium. As part of their experience, students were encouraged to communicate with each\nother within the virtual environment and actively share their insights with each other about\nhow these three-dimensional replicas might figure into a broader educational setting.\nThe researcher added an intervention to the tour and did not announce it in advance. In\neach of these sessions, students engaged with a guest avatar with years of expertise in navi-\ngating Second Life and experience interacting with students. One guest expert was a profes-\nsor in educational leadership and joined students in the lounge area of a virtual church.\nAnother guest expert was a docent at a virtual space flight museum. Both guest avatars\napproached the group of students and engaged them in conversation about their experiences\nwhile their facilitator stood by. The conversations lasted approximately 10 minutes and\nwere concluded by the tour leader on the pretence of needing to continue the tour.\nThese experienced users simply joined the group as part of the general tour and were not\nformally introduced as possessing expertise or experience. The guest avatars engaged\nstudent participants for approximately 10 minutes then excused themselves as the tour\ncontinued. During the tour, participants encountered random avatars in the virtual environ-\nment and could join or initiate other conversations in progress if they wished.\nAfter the two-hour tour was completed, students completed an online survey of their\nexperiences. Aside from questions about their previous experience with Second Life, the\nsurvey asked two open-response questions. One asked them to discuss anything in the IVW\nthat was a cause of frustration for them. Another question reminded them of their meeting\nwith the guest avatar and asked them to discuss what set the quest apart from other avatars\nthey may have encountered.\nThe results of the open-ended questions were summarised and categorised into\nresearcher-created typologies based on similarities between the responses. These were\ncounted and recorded. Additionally, the researcher hoped that transcripts of chat sessions\nfrom the tours would help to validate responses from the survey. Unfortunately, since some\nof the participants were using voice-enabled sessions using their own microphones, we were\nunable to keep records of any private inter-participant conversations.\nOne element of the course was for students to maintain blogs about their experiences,\nincluding those in Second Life. Comments about their interactions with the guests provided\nadditional data.\nThe responses to the survey, administered immediately after the two-hour tour, were\nseparated into semantic units and grouped by similarity. The researcher then created typol-\nogies to categorise the responses based upon terminologies found in the current literature on\nonline communities. The small number of respondents (n = 8) provided an opportunity for\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   177\na simple set of typologies which, if the study were to be replicated with a larger sample,\ncould easily be expanded upon.\nResults\nThree main groupings of responses were considered in this study: issues of familiarity with\nthe IVW, issues on communication within the IVW, and observations stemming from their\ninteractions with the guest avatars.\nFamiliarity\nThis sample of participants was unique in that none of the eight respondents had ever used\nSecond Life before. Six had not even heard about it prior to their coursework. Consequently,\nanalyses could not be made comparing degrees of experience in virtual environments.\nParticipants\u2019 self-reported degree of familiarity with the virtual environment, choosing\none descriptor from a list, described their comfort level in the environment as uncertain\n(three responses), somewhat confident (three responses), and clumsy (two responses).\nCommunication\nAll but one of the respondents commented about communication issues and voiced similar\nconcerns that their inexperience with navigation and reading the stream of Instant Messages\ncaused them to lose contact with the larger group. Specific concerns about loss of commu-\nnication with the group were the result of technical issues (three responses), navigation\nissues (three responses), inexperience with Instant Messaging (two responses), and their\ninability to search for classmates (one response).\nGuest avatars\nUsing the researcher-created set of typologies, comments about the guest avatars from both\nthe surveys and student blogs were assigned into categories for ease of analysis. These cate-\ngories were: (1) Mannerisms; (2) Interaction; (3) Appearance; and (4) Messaging.\nMannerisms\nParticipants were keenly aware of avatars with a significant knowledge of Second Life.\nThey took note of the following mannerisms: (1) asking permission to join conversations in\nprogress; (2) ease of movement, especially the ability to fly; and (3) smooth navigation\naround virtual objects such as chairs.\nInteraction\nParticipants made several comments in both the surveys and their blogs based on engaging\nthese guest avatars. Primarily, these comments could be summarised as: (1) conversations\nwith the guest avatars calmed their agitation about the virtual world; (2) guest avatars\u2019 fluid\nmovements were equated with experience and expertise; and (3) guest avatars encouraged\nparticipation in the discussion. Of greater concern to them was their own inability to make\ntheir avatar move naturally. The guest avatars made navigation appear very natural.\n178  M. Hamilton McVey\nAppearance\nParticipants made almost no reference to the customised appearances of expert avatars who\nboasted only simple adornments such as a pony tail and a clipboard. One commented in a\nblog entry about the large bat wings on a randomly encountered avatar. Avatar appearance\ndid not appear to be a significant factor in determining the expertise level of the guest\navatars. In only one case did the avatar\u2019s clothing appear to lend comfort to a new partici-\npant and that was in reference to the instructor\u2019s avatar which wore a tuxedo jacket and tie,\nchosen specifically to lend an air of authority.\nMessaging\nParticipants also noticed the behaviour of the guest avatars when engaged in Instant\nMessaging. In Second Life, one may communicate directly with a microphone but many of\nthe new participants used text in the form of Instant Messages. Several participants noted\nthat the guest avatars: (1) posted only short lines of text; (2) did not usually post complex\nthoughts in a single message; and (3) broke long messages into several short ones. This last\nactivity made it easier for new participants to read quickly and participate in the synchro-\nnous discussion. Overall, this consideration of the limitations of the medium is a character-\nistic that set guest avatars apart from the new participants and random encounters with other\navatars.\nDiscussion\nDespite the fact that none of the eight respondents had ever visited Second Life before, they\nwere enthusiastic about their experience and eager to navigate the virtual world. Their\nprimary goal for taking the tour was to consider educational applications for IVWs in a\nbroader learning environment such as a secondary school setting. One idea that emerged\nfrom this conversation was the idea of performing plays on a model of the Globe Theatre.\nThe instructor designed the objectives for this exploration to be as flexible as possible\nbecause of the variety of teaching backgrounds of the participants. What was interesting and\nnoteworthy in reviewing their comments on the survey and in their blogs was the degree of\nsimilarity in their responses.\nAlthough technical issues varied among respondents, almost to a person they noted a\nconcern about losing contact with the whole group. This loss of contact came about through\nnavigation difficulties, inexperience with some of the communication tools, and an inability\nto use search tools to find their colleagues. Students can overcome these issues with time,\nexperience, and training in the environment, but for the first time exploring these environ-\nments, separation from the group was a discomforting experience. They relied on their\nclassmates to help them to figure out the experience.\nFrom the perspective of an instructor attempting to organise a classroom in the Second\nLife environment, it appears to be a highly valuable practice to keep the group together at\nfirst. Taking close note that all of the members of the group have transported with you from\none area to another will prevent disorientation, confusion, and frustration.\nInstructors new to Second Life should be keenly aware of the way they communicate\nwith their students. This study offers several suggestions based upon the observations gath-\nered and recorded by new participants when they encounter other avatars with far more\nexperience in the virtual world. The lessons learned deal with communication, social\nconventions, and navigation.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   179\nCommunication should be in short bursts\nIt appears that short bursts of information are best in this environment. It also appears that\ninstructors should set aside sufficient time for their students to explore movement and\ncommunication in the virtual environment. Students should be encouraged to practice\nmoving their avatars, include gestures in their communications, and avoid excessive Instant\nMessaging unless answering a question. The instructor should consider the entire experi-\nence as an exercise in communication and should be keenly aware of the potential for\nfrustration on the part of the participants.\nAvatar movements should follow social conventions\nEven students new to Second Life appear to be sensitive to social aspects of communication.\nAfter a demonstration of how to make an avatar produce gestures such as a wave, students\nwere anxious to learn how to make their own avatars gesture. The ability to gesture soon\nbecame part of the communication skill set the participants used. Social conventions, such\nas approaching then standing just beyond an ongoing conversation then asking permission\nto interact with strangers, appear to be skills mastered by the experienced guests. Under-\nstanding these unspoken rules may assist students in having positive experiences in a virtual\nlearning environment, especially when they explore on their own.\nTime to explore is time well spent\nFor students new to the Second Life environment it would be wise to allow practice time to\novercome navigation issues, to ensure the varied computer systems can manage the soft-\nware, to make certain microphones work if they are being used, and to train students to write\nshorter statements when using Instant Messaging.\nConclusions\nImmersive Virtual Words certainly generate a great deal of excitement and enthusiasm on\nthe part of students and instructors alike, especially those in higher education settings.\nInstructors considering the use of such a tool should realise there is just as much potential\nfor enhanced communication with their students as there is for impeded communication.\nThe observations of graduate students new to IVWs as they interact with experts familiar\nwith conventions and navigation within virtual worlds are instructive for professors consid-\nering using such affordances for the first time. In addition to the number of steps a student\nmust take to acquire the software, create an avatar, and learn how to navigate, there is a great\ndeal of reported anxiety about the experience. Instructors would be wise to take such factors\ninto account in order to create an experience focused more on the content than the platform.\nFor the instructor new to the IVW, a lack of awareness of mannerisms and social\nconventions in the virtual environment can easily become debilitating and make even the\nmost competent instructor in a face-to-face classroom appear clumsy and awkward in front\nof virtual students. Taking time to acquire some digital adornments or a more extensive\nelectronic wardrobe would be one way to prepare for hosting a class in an immersive\nenvironment. Of even greater value would be the mastery of basic navigation and learning\na few social conventions from a colleague familiar with IVWs.\nOf course, it is always the content and quality of the message that is of the utmost value\nbut, from the perspective of an instructor, the message must always be properly framed. In\n180  M. Hamilton McVey\nthe virtual environment, this proper framing requires work from the instructor. It includes\nknowledge of navigation and movement, a collection of appropriate adornments or\ncostumes, and an awareness of mannerisms and social conventions.\nReferences\nBielman, V., L.
