This paper attempts to set out the pragmatic features of everyday \ninteraction with objects to enhance sociological understanding of design and consumption \nand illustrates the processes of material interaction with the examples of making flat-pack \nfurniture and professional work on cars. The concept of \u201epragmatics\u201f is derived from the \nwritings of Pierce and Morris and their approach to the study of signs is developed with \nreference to Barthes. Meaningful material interaction involves the subject\/object, \nperson\/thing relations of perception and gesture and these are developed from the theories \nof Merleau-Ponty and Leroi-Gourhan. The pragmatic dimensions of material interaction are \nproposed to be: intention, perception, orientation, manipulation and continuation. \n  - 3 - \nIntroduction \nThe process both of designing and consuming \u201estuff\u201f \u2013 material objects \u2013 presupposes \nmaterial interaction. To design an object is to build into it characteristics of form and function \nthat will be responded to by the consumer through material interaction. Designing involves a \nset of practices \u2013 imagining, drawing, discussing, mocking-up, prototyping, playing with \u2013 \nthat prefigure material interaction with the final product. Design is directed towards the \nmaterial interaction that the consumer will engage in, so we can imagine the consumer \ninteracting with the object more or less as the designer intended while recognising that this \ndoes not always work out. Commodity design is of course a \u201emass medium\u201f because the \ncommunication is one-to-many by dint of the design being applied to standardised products \nfrom a production line, although the individual consumer\u201fs interaction with the object is \nparticular and singular. This connection between designer and consumer could be construed \nas a one-to-one communication process between them as individuals in which the object \nacts as an intermediary or vehicle but in fact the process is cultural and shared. \nOn the floor were two cardboard boxes, three foot by two foot by three inches. The \ninvoice said it was a chest of drawers\u2026 and indeed a chest of drawers had been \nordered some weeks before from a picture in a catalogue. A chest of drawers is a box \nwith other boxes slotted into it, handles for grasping and pulling, that you can put \nstuff in. But what was in the cardboard boxes just wasn\u2019t big enough for that. \nAlthough it didn\u2019t make sense as a \u2018chest of drawers\u2019 the cardboard boxes had \nobvious openings where flaps were held down by tape and cutting through the tape \nwould allow Rachel to get at whatever was inside. And inside there were some familiar \nbits; what looked like drawer-fronts with holes for knobs. But then there were series \nof identical pieces with slots and holes and a couple of bags of bits. Some things \nwere odd; long straight pieces, one curved spar and sheets of hardboard \u2013 were they \npart of the packing? \nThe building of flat-pack furniture will provide one running example for this paper that will \nexplore what is involved in material interaction.1 Many people have had a go at making up \nflat-pack furniture, but even those who haven\u201ft will be familiar with the \u201econstruction kit\u201f idea \nand will have had at least some of the experience of unwrapping a new object and finding \nout how to fit it into their ordinary lives\u2026 and perhaps even reading the instructions. The \nsecond running example is of a professional technician working on a car to replace a timing \nbelt. Like the flat-pack furniture builder he is engaging in material interaction and the way he \ndoes it has many similarities.2 \n  - 4 - \nRoger has changed many timing belts on many different types of car\u2026 but not on this \nparticular model. And he knows that because it has twin overhead cam shafts, when \nthe old belt comes off, the valve springs will move the cam shafts out of alignment \nwith each other. There is a special tool that could hold the sprockets on the end of the \nshafts in alignment. But his garage doesn\u2019t have one that will fit this car and when he \nasks the boss, he\u2019s told to go ahead without one. Uncertain of how he is going to \ncomplete it, he proceeds with the job carefully, step by step, removing components \nfrom the top of the engine and from underneath so that he can get at the belt. Before \nhe can get access to the encased timing belt, one of the components he will remove is \nthe water pump drivebelt on the outside of the casing. \nIn both these situations the \u201econsumer\u201f3 engages in material interaction with objects that \nhave been designed to be interacted with in a particular way. The \u201edesigner\u201f4 (of the chest of \ndrawers, of the engine) has anticipated that this sort of interaction will be necessary and the \nobjects are made to respond in predictable ways. There is then human intentionality \nembedded within the objects that is released as the user interacts with them. This paper will \nexplore the parameters of the process of material interaction as it is undertaken by the \nconsumer when they take up material objects for use. In expanding on the idea of material \ninteraction \u2013 the lived relations between human beings and material objects \u2013 I will argue \nthat the process is meaningful, that the meaning of objects is understood by consumers \nthrough \u201ereading\u201f them as a set of signs that are understood through the culture and that the \nrelation is pragmatic in that the meaningfulness of objects unfolds through interaction. I will \nshortly return to why the notion of \u201epragmatics\u201f might be useful to understand how material \ninteraction proceeds and then begin to think through some of what is involved in building the \nchest of drawers and changing the timing belt.  \nHuman interaction with things \nThere is a body of work that addresses human interaction with artefacts that primarily \nemerges from trying to understand and design electronic, informational systems. Much of \nthis academic research is concerned with \u201ehuman-computer interaction\u201f (HCI) or the related \nfield of \u201ecomputer supported cooperative work\u201f (CSCW) and language is often central to \nanalysis, either because it accompanies interaction with objects or because it provides \naccounts of how things are used. Those such as Suchman and her colleagues (1983, 2000, \n2002) and the Work, Interaction and Technology Research Group (WIT) at King\u201fs College \nLondon5 (see e.g. Heath and Luff 2000; Hindmarsh and Heath 2000; Heath and Knoblauch \nand Luff 2000) have developed distinctive approaches to the analysis of the process of \n  - 5 - \nworking relationships between human beings and things such as photocopiers, prototypes, \nlegal records, medical records, and the equipment found in news production, train control \nrooms, auction rooms and so on. The methodologies developed in this sort of research \nbegin from traditions (symbolic interactionism, ethnomethodology, conversation analysis) \nthat take the process of language very seriously and see meaning as an unfolding property \nof language in use rather than simply a semantic property of the words used or even their \ngrammatical constructions. Some researchers, including a number of the studies reported in \nLuff, Hindmarsh and Heath (2000), also address interactional issues between humans and \nobjects and emphasise the situated character of the way things are made sense of (see also \nLave and Wenger, 1991; Chaiklin and Lave 1993). Many of these studies use video data to \nanalyse how people use things and make sense of them and the researchers have begun to \nmove beyond simply taking the accompanying talk as a guide to what is going on; \nincreasingly, glances and movements in relation to things are recognised as important \nindicators of how things are interacted with (Goodwin, 1994; Hindmarsh and Heath 2003; \nvom Lehn, Heath and Hindmarsh 2001; Heath and vom Lehm 2004). Recently the power of \nphenomenology as a resource for understanding how embodied relationships with objects \noperates has begun to be explored by some HCI researchers (Dourish 2004, Robertson \nnd.). These developments have begun to explore how human beings interact meaningfully \nwith objects directly, not just in the course of their interactions with other human beings. \nLarssen, Robertson and Edwards move this research approach on a stage further by \nrecognising that there is a language-like \u201edialogue\u201f between the human being and the object \nthat is part of what they call the \u201efeel dimension\u201f of technology interactions: \u201eIt is a dialogue \nwhere movement is the mode of communication\u201f (2006: 330).  \nWithin anthropology Michael Brian Schiffer (1999, 2001) argues that actions incorporating \nobjects can be understood as language-like communicative actions. He argues that animals, \nincluding humans, use their life experiences and life history to make inferences about the \nmeaning and significance of objects and materiality and do so by responding to \u201etraces\u201f \nattached or associated with the object (1999: 54). Humans use \u201ecorrelons\u201f or systems of \nassociation (Schiffer 1999: 56) to infer from objects and behaviour the meaning and \nsignificance of actions and artefacts (schemas, frames, patterns, classifications, codes, \nimages and so on) that may not be expressible in linguistic form (smells for example have \ncorrelons that we react to but find difficult to put into words). Schiffer\u201fs theory of objects as \n\u201einteractors\u201f that have communicative effect is fascinating and has many parallels with the \nposition that is being developed in this paper; the impact of culture, the non-synchronous \ncommunication of meaning via objects, the importance of bodily action. As the philosopher \nTheodore Schatzki\u201fs argues, \u201eobjects \u2026 acquire meaning within practices\u201f and contribute to \n  - 6 - \nthe constitution of sayings and doings as social practices (1996: 113). From psychology, \nactivity theory has for some time recognised the role of material things in the \u201eobject \norientation\u201f (Leont\u201fev 1979: 48) of human action and this approach has begun to be applied \nin a variety of social contexts (e.g. Engestr\u00f6m  2007). \nIn this broad research literature6 there is much that has informed the analysis of the process \nof material interaction being developed in this paper and much that deserves more detailed \ndiscussion. What is being carried forward is the need to find an analytical approach to the \nway human beings interact with objects within their culture that recognises that meaning is \nexchanged, even when there are no other humans being present to talk to and the object is \nnot simply the vehicle for ordinary language. For the study of consumption and design this is \nimportant because people communicate with objects in their culture directly, not simply via \nadvertisements, instruction manuals or labels inscribed on their surfaces (such as \u201eVolume\u201f \nprinted beneath a control on sound equipment). Consumers communicate through sight, \ntouch \u2013 and sometimes other senses \u2013 using their whole body to both make sense of and to \nmake use of the things around them. This is not achieved through instinctual behaviour or \neven simple learnt behaviour but through the complex cultural acquisition of the meanings of \nobjects that is characteristic of a particular formation of material civilization (Dant 2006). The \ncommunication process between humans and objects is \u201epragmatic\u201f in the sense that \nmeaning is contingent on the current situation that continually unfolds in the course of the \ninteraction with the object. It is particularly difficult to get access to because it is so familiar in \nordinary life that we seldom notice it unless things go wrong and because the meaning \nexchanged between a person and a thing is not directly available to an observer. We can \noften simply impute or conjecture what meanings are understood between person and thing \nbut to do so is presume what is going on without any evidence or subtlety. So I will use my \ntwo illustrative examples that through the intermediary of special objects \u2013 diagrams \u2013 show \noccasions when what things mean has become a problem. As consumers read diagrams to \nhelp them make sense of an array of objects they show that they are also \u201ereading\u201f the \nobjects themselves and that the meaning they derive from that reading is contingent on the \nactivity being undertaken. \nPragmatics \nThe term \u201epragmatics\u201f was coined by Charles Morris as one of the dimensions of semiosis, \nthe system of exchanging meaning through signs, that he developed in the 1930s. Its \nmeaning is simply put: \u201eBy \u201cpragmatics\u201d is designated the science of the relation of signs to \ntheir interpreters\u201f (Morris 1971 [1938]: 43). Morris chose the term to refer to the pragmatic \n  - 7 - \nphilosophy of Peirce, James, Dewey and Mead but he was careful to distinguish it from \n\u201epragmatism\u201f by saying that pragmatics dealt with the \u201ebiotic aspects of semiosis, that is, with \nall the psychological, biological and sociological phenomena which occur in the functioning \nof signs\u201f (ibid). This seems to leave an enormous field open for pragmatics but it is \ntraditionally distinguished from syntax (the relations of signs to one another) and semantics \n(the relations of signs to the objects to which they are applicable) as the other dimensions of \nsemiotics (Levinson 1983: 1). The study of pragmatics has become a substantive area within \nlinguistics that overlaps and incorporates a range of other disciplines, including psychology \nand sociology and which focuses on how non-linguistic features of language use contribute \nto the communication of meaning. Perhaps the most famous and most striking pragmatic \nfeature of language is the idea of indexical or deictic expressions that depend on the context \nof utterance for their meaning to be clear; these are occasions when an utterance derives its \nmeaning from some one, some thing or some time or place that are not specified within the \nutterance but is apparent from the context.7 Pragmatics has developed as a sub-field in \nlinguistics that has drawn on philosophical ideas about speech act theory and implicature as \nwell as the sociological study of conversation analysis (see e.g. Levinson, 1983; Mey 2001).   \nBut how does pragmatics, which is about the relation of signs to their interpreters, apply to \nmaterial interaction when there are apparently no signs involved because there is no \nlinguistic exchange? Schiffer might say that the consumer \u201einfers\u201f that a piece of wood from \nthe flat-pack furniture is a drawer-front from her previous experience of chests of drawers \nand their drawer-fronts. The object is then a sign for what its cultural meaning is and this is \nnecessary for interacting with it in any meaningful way. Of course young children or \nchimpanzees lacking the necessary cultural biography probably wouldn\u201ft be able to make \nsuch meaning out of the objects and would perhaps pick them up and throw them or at best \nbuild them into piles.8 There is support for this way of thinking about signs in the writing of \nPeirce (1991), the philosopher who inspired Morris to articulate his theory of signs and who \nis the originator of the idea of indexicality and what he calls \u201esemiotic\u201f. Peirce famously \ndistinguishes between \u201eobject\u201f, \u201esign\u201f and \u201einterpretant\u201f but what is important if somewhat \nconfusing is that \u201eobjects\u201f are not necessarily material objects, in the world, outside the \ninterpreter. Ideas can also be objects that are symbolised as signs which is why his definition \nof the sign is so elliptical: \u201eanything which, being determined by an object, determines an \ninterpretation to determination, through it, by the same object\u201f (Peirce 1991: 251 \u2013 italics in \noriginal). In contradistinction to the idea of a sign as an \u201eimplement of communication\u201f, Peirce \nargues that in order for a sign to have meaning in communication it must first be recognised \nas having that meaning: \u201eif we regard it as an outward object, and as addressing itself to a \n  - 8 - \nhuman mind, that mind must first apprehend it as an object in itself, and only after that \nconsider it in its significance\u201f (Peirce 1991: 255).  \nThe determination of the object as a sign is tied up with its interpretation which is, at least in \npart, determined from what the interpreter already knows. Before the consumer can think \n\u201cthat\u201fs a drawer-front!\u201d she must know what a \u201edrawer-front\u201f is and recognise its significance \nand interpret this object as one. Only once the object is interpreted as a sign of a drawer-\nfront is it possible to start searching for the sides and knobs to go with it \u2013 even if there is no \nlinguistic utterance with its own signs and indexicality. This paper is concerned with the \npragmatics of that initial and direct interpretive engagement with material artefacts that have \nmeaning because designers invested them with it. They created an object that, in turn, \nmakes reference to the material culture of chests of drawers. \nThe pragmatics of material interaction are concerned with those practices by which human \nbeings derive cultural meaning and value from things. These practices are an expression of \nthe culture and link the individual to their society. They may also be construed as a \ndiscontinuous dialogue between designer and consumer. \nFrom semiotic to semiology \nDespite Peirce, the way that semiosis is usually understood is as a sort of second order \nlanguage that operates in codes with different levels of meaning that ultimately have \nideological effect. This approach is most closely associated with Barthes\u201fs development of \n\u201esemiology\u201f as a method of cultural analysis that has its origins in linguistics. He refers to the \n\u201esystems\u201f (e.g. the garment, food, car and furniture systems) in which the meaning of \ndifferent types of objects is derived from codes made up of the syntagmatic relations with \nother objects in the system (Barthes 1973: 25-9). This is a rather different and apparently \nrestricted notion of the operation of signs compared to Peirce\u201fs semiotic and Barthes is \ncareful to distinguish the meaning he wishes to address semiologically from the function of \nthe object; what is important is how the object is read as an appearance. Here he makes this \nclear in relation to the telephone:  \n\u2026 the appearance of a telephone always has a meaning independent of \nits function: a white telephone always transmits a certain notion of \nluxury or of femininity; there are bureaucratic telephones, there are old-\nfashioned telephones which transmit the notion of a certain period \n(1925); in short, the telephone itself is susceptible of belonging to a \nsystem of objects-as-signs\u2026 (Barthes 1983: 182)9 \nThis familiar way of understanding semiology is however not all that Barthes had in mind. In \nthe Elements of Semiology (1973), he refers to the car and fashion systems as having a \nnumber of sub-systems; the car system is on the one hand to do with the form and \n  - 9 - \nspecification of the car as purchased but another mode of its \u201espeech\u201f is to do with the \nsociological features of driving and the variations in usage of the car (Barthes 1973: 29). The \ngarment system has three modes of speech; clothes as written about, clothes as \nphotographed and finally clothes as worn, in which there are rules about the association of \ntypes of clothes and the form that they take up (Barthes 1973: 27). However, when Barthes \nshortly afterwards turned to study the fashion system (1990) he focussed his attention on \nclothes as written, leaving clothes as photographed to a brief appendix and clothes as worn \nto be implied. He recognises the use of objects \u2013 cars as driven, clothes as worn \u2013 as being \nsemiological systems of meaning but he never attempted to engage in any analyses of these \nmodes of speech. If he had, he would have been analyzing what I have referred to as \nmaterial interaction and his idea of the sign would have been extended to be much more \nnearly what Peirce had in mind. \nBarthes comes closest to exploring the meaning of objects in action when he comments that \nan object which seems to be purely instrumental and \u201eeffectively serves some purpose\u2026 \nalso serves to communicate information; we might sum it up by saying that there is always a \nmeaning which overflows the object\u201fs use\u201f (1983: 182). The telephone on his desk functions \nas a sign of someone who needs to make telephone calls and his use of it is tied up with this \nmeaning; the telephone is a device for making contact with others, it is a nuisance when it \nrings, it is an expense, it is something that gets dirty and needs cleaning \u2013 especially if it is \nwhite \u2013 and it requires culturally acquired bodily skills to make it function (pressing the right \nbuttons, using menus, volume controls and so on). Children today may be adept at \u201etexting\u201f \nwith their thumbs but would they understand how to enter numbers on an \u201eold-fashioned\u201f dial \ntelephone? Although Barthes\u201fs own analyses were of the appearances of objects as pure \nsigns that could be discussed outside of the context of use, he recognised that meaning and \nuse were connected. \nPerception and Gesture \nThe pragmatics of material interaction is about the relations of material objects as signs to \ntheir interpreters but how are they established? There are accidents with objects and there \nare unintended consequences of material interactions, but I want to argue in the remainder \nof this paper that there are two modes of any intentional material interaction, perception and \ngesture, and it is through them and only them that the meaningfulness of such an interaction \ncan be realised.10 It is of course characteristic of human behaviour with objects that \naccidents and mistakes are \u201erecovered\u201f by trying to work out what happened; to give \nmeaning to the situation after the event so that future or continuing interaction can be \n  - 10 - \norganised. Instruction, whether through speech, text or demonstration, can also be used to \nbring the meanings of objects to someone\u201fs attention. \nMeaningful material interaction is achieved by a blend of perception \u2013 reading the signs of \nthe material world \u2013 and gesture \u2013 intentional action in and on that material world that \nchanges it and its meaning. I am using the term \u201eperception\u201f in the sense that Maurice \nMerleau-Ponty (1962) does and the term \u201egesture\u201f in the sense that Andr\u00e9 Leroi-Gourhan \n(1993) does.11 These two authors were writing at about the same time but with very different \ndisciplinary orientations and no systematic reference to each other\u201fs work. Merleau-Ponty \nwas a phenomenological philosopher whose interest was in understanding human existence \nthrough its lived, embodied, experience. What is perhaps most distinctive about his writing is \nthe idea that perception is linked on the one hand to memory and the operation of mind and \non the other to the motor capacity and situation of the body; perception depends on a mix of \nprevious perceptual and cultural experience together with current bodily engagement with its \nsurroundings. As Merleau-Ponty puts it cultural knowledge is \u201eknowledge that remains latent\u201f \nso that colours are not simply physical properties of the way light is reflected from certain \nsurfaces but are associated with cultural experiences, \u201elived as realities\u201f (1983: 168). \nContemporary perceptions are linked to the experiences, habits and routine practices of the \nbody (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 238). Perception and gesture are then routinely blended together \nas everyday actions are repeated in familiar surroundings in which the \u201ereading\u201f of the \nmaterial environment and the \u201egestures\u201f to engage with it don\u201ft require consciously formed \ninterpretations or intentions to act: \nMy flat is for me, not a set of closely associated images. It remains a \nfamiliar domain round about me only as long as I still have \u2018in my \nhands\u2019 or \u2018in my legs\u2019 the main distances and directions involved, and \nas long as from my body intentional threads run out towards it. \n(Merleau-Ponty 1962: 130) \nThe relationship between action and knowledge then is not separable for actions that are \nfamiliar; perception is not a single act but a \u201ewhole open series of possible experiences\u201f \n(Merleau-Ponty 1962: 212). In a series of telling metaphors Merleau-Ponty shows how \nperception and action are tied together by what he calls \u201eintentional threads\u201f; the body is \n\u201eanchored\u201f in space, it has a \u201egrip\u201f on the material environment and is \u201egeared\u201f to the objects \nit works with (1962: 250, 251, 253). As he puts it, \u201ebeing is synonymous with being situated\u201f \n(Merleau-Ponty 1962: 252) and being situated means interacting with a material \nenvironment. \nIn a different take on the relationship between perception and action, the anthropologist and \narchaeologist Andr\u00e9 Leroi-Gourhan (1993) in a series of works from the 1940s explored the \n  - 11 - \nevolutionary relationship between human beings and technology from an ethnological \nperspective. He pointed out that the bodily features that we might recognise as human \n(opposable thumbs, brain size, bi-polar vision) are shared with other primates but what \ndistinguishes the evolution of humans from apes is the capacity to use both hands \nsimultaneously while standing or even moving on two legs. It is the evolutionary emergence \nof what he calls the \u201eanthropomorph\u201f \u2013 hands completely free, erect posture, with brain skill \nfreed from the vertebral column (Leroi-Gourhan 1993: 38) \u2013 that leads to the capacity of the \nmodern human. In principle the dexterity and precision of gesture available to the human \nanimal is available to the higher apes but the difference \u201eis one of nervous apparatus alone\u201f  \n(Leroi-Gourhan 1993: 239). It is the particular form of the early humans that enabled the \ndevelopment of brain capacity which then makes available to humans a gestural complexity \nnot shared by any other animal. Leroi-Gourhan (1993) points out that the thing that makes \nhumans a distinctive sort of animal is their non-adaptation. Other animals have bodies that \nevolved for particular environments, particular ways of feeding and so on but the human \nanimal is \u201ea tortoise when we are beneath a roof, a crab when we hold out a pair of pliers, a \nhorse when we bestride a mount\u201f (Leroi-Gourhan 1993: 246). Human evolution is exterior to \nthe body; it is in the way we have built tools, machines and information systems of \nincreasing complexity that enable us to engage not only individually but collectively and \nsocially with our material environment. This evolution of a material culture, of things that do \nthings and things that remember things, outside of the human body is of course possible \nbecause human behaviour is predominantly cultural rather than instinctive. \nAlthough they approach human being from two different directions, Merleau-Ponty from the \nphenomenology of perception, Leroi-Gourhan from the ethnology of human gestural \ncapacity, they both see perception and gesture linked together in a way that is both \nembodied and cultural. When their insights are combined we can see that perception is tied \nto cultural knowledge and situated embodiedness and gesture flows from intentions that are \nrealised through bodily actions that can be extended by tools. Tools are not only extensions \nof the body\u201fs gestural capacity but are also devices that link the individual to their culture and \nprovide a resource with which to manage perception. Most of the time the two channels of \nrelations with objects \u2013 perception and gesture \u2013 are contiguous, running seamlessly \ntogether often without the need for conscious thought that distinguishes them. Once familiar \nwith the completed chest of drawers someone can approach it, open it, place folded clothes \nin the drawer, close the draw and turn away in a flow of material interaction with the object \nthat apparently requires no interpretation of it as a set of signs, and no distinction between \nperception and gesture (which isn\u201ft to say that the process lacks intentionality or that the \nmaterial objects are not read as signs). Similarly Roger will remove a nut in a steady \n  - 12 - \nsequence of perception and gesture that requires no reflection \u2013 even though he may \nchange his grip on the spanner as the nut becomes freer and he changes from spanner to \nfingers (as Ray does in another instance from this data set \u2013 see Dant 2005: 111-114). \nNow the reason for picking as running examples the consumer struggling with assembling \nflat-pack furniture and Roger changing a cam-belt without the special tool, is that, unlike \nmuch routine and habitual material interaction, both situations required pause for thought so \nthe perceptual and gestural components of the material interaction were separated \u2013 \nperception or \u201ereading\u201f of objects goes on for a period of time before gestural \u201eacting on\u201f \nobjects goes ahead. This becomes explicit because in both situations tools are used, not \nonly for gestures that work on the material objects, but also for assistance with reading the \nobjects. A classic form of such perceptual tools are instruction manuals with linguistic \ninformation, but in both these examples the \u201eknowledge\u201f devices used are diagrams \u2013 a form \nof what Peirce calls \u201eiconic signs\u201f.12  \nAfter an inspection of various pieces and some exploratory putting together of pieces \nthat looked as if they might fit, Rachel consulted the sequence of nine diagrams that \nshowed how to assemble the chest of drawers. It initially identified all the different \ncomponents \u2013 and some that at first glance had appeared to be the same, turned out, \nwhen counted and compared with the images, to be different \u2013 and showed in an \nexploded diagram what their orientation was in the final object. The diagrams showed \nsets of objects and related them with dotted lines and large arrows that indicated how \nthey would connect. The sequence of diagrams showed a series of steps; \u2018reading\u2019 \nthe diagram enabled \u2018reading\u2019 the various component objects in relation to each other \nand the gestures needed to make a chest of drawers \u2013 see Figure 1.  \nPrior to consulting the diagram, some objects worked as signs that could be related to each \nother (drawer-front, drawer knobs) but most were meaningless in terms of the chest of \ndrawers (bits of wood, screws). But when Rachel read the diagram, the images helped her to \nread the array of objects on the floor which began to make sense as signs (particular \nscrews; backs and sides, struts and beams) and their relationship to the completed object \nmeaningful. The diagrams hinted at gestures that would transform the bits materially \u2013 this \nbit would go here, that fit there (although diagrams about how to turn an Allen key were not \nnecessary). \nAs Roger disassembled engine parts he arranged them in a rough sequence around \nthe car (not according to a system but according to situation; parts from underneath \ngo in the sump tray, parts from on top go on the back of the engine compartment, \nparts from the wheel cavity go on the removed wheel or on the lift). But before \n  - 13 - \nremoving the water pump drivebelt he drew a diagram of its arrangement because he \nknew that its rubbery flexible properties meant that the way it fits around a set of \nwheels would disappear once it was separated from them. He trusted himself to be \nable to read the other objects he had removed in order to refit them onto the car but \nthe water pump drivebelt would become unreadable in its relation to other parts \u2013 see \nFigure 2. \nWhereas for Roger, most objects are immediately readable as signs of themselves (a bolt is \nrecognisable as having a screw thread and not being a nut, its size is appropriate for some \nlocations and not others), his diagram will mediate how the rubber belt relates to other \nobjects, particularly the pulleys it goes around, even when the belt is removed and reverts to \na featureless ellipse. Roger could never have read by sight what he drew because other \nthings were in the way (see Figure 3) and much of Roger\u201fs reading of the objects on the car \nwas through touch, a sort of \u201ehaptic\u201f reading of things, because of their inaccessibility. \nIn both instances, the use of the diagrams interrupts the normal flow of material interaction in \nwhich perception and gesture are simply part of a continuous process. Rachel stops working \nwith the bits on the floor in order to read the diagram which then helps her to read the \nseparate objects. Roger stops undoing car parts to draw a diagram that will help him to read \nthe objects he has separated. Analytically these the interplay between perception and \ngesture in material interaction can themselves be set out diagrammatically as in Figure 4. \nTowards the pragmatics of material interaction \nIn the absence of linguistic communication about or as part of material interaction it can be \nseen as a process in which the body of a person moves and makes contact with an object so \nthat at least the object changes in accord with an intention that is recognisable within a \ncultural practice; we might call this process \u201epurposeful action\u201f (Suchman 1987: 2). The \nmaterial world is transformed in ways that are significant in terms of both the material \nrelations of objects and their meaning. For example, a hand goes out and grasps an Allen \nkey (the chest of drawers) or a Y-spanner (the pump drivebelt tensioner) and applies it to \nanother object \u2013 a threaded bolt or nut. At the end of a sequence of material interaction, the \nside of the drawer is attached to the front or the pump drivebelt is released and separated \nfrom its pulleys. As well as the hand \/ eye coordination involved, the human has to know how \nAllen keys fit into the head of a bolt or how the spanner fits around the head of a nut. Both \ntool systems require an understanding of the operation of screw threads and how tight is \ntight in different circumstances. These are the sorts of material interactions that most of us \ntake for granted as \u201eobvious\u201f but that higher primates \u2013 including our own very young \n  - 14 - \nchildren \u2013 have great difficulty with. How any given material interaction is to be achieved has \nto be learnt within a cultural context in much the same way as language, and indeed such \npractices are learnt alongside and with the support of language.  \nThe relations between person and object(s) that produce pragmatic meaning in material \ninteraction can be summarised in the following preliminary way: \n1. Intention: Intentionality directs the engagement of perception and gesture with an \nobject. Intentions may not be consciously thought or even recognised as such, but be \nsimply part of the flow of action \u2013 as with routine practices and habits \u2013 but would in \nprinciple be recoverable after the event. \n2. Perception: The object is perceived in relation to the body via the senses (in the \nexamples used, of sight, touch and proprioception but may also include hearing, \nsmell and taste). Perception involves the interpretation of sensory information \nthrough the knowledge and experience of material culture that enables objects and \nobject arrays to be \u201eread\u201f to identify objects, their form, qualities, properties, their \ncurrent state, relation to other objects and how they would respond to gestures. \n3. Orientation: The orientation of the body to the object is part of perception; range, \ndirection, accessibility and amenability to gesture of the object or array of objects are \nread from a particular location of the body. The body may be moved to get a better \nview or prepare to act on an object as when the body is brought close enough so that \nobjects are part of the \u201emanipulatory area\u201f (see Dant 2005: 115-122).  \n4. Manipulation: A gesture begins as movement of the body brings about movement in \nthe object that transforms it in some way, usually through the hands, often via the \nintermediary object of a tool. Touch here does \u201ework\u201f in the sense of applying effort to \nbring about change in a way that doesn\u201ft happen with touch for simply reading the \nobject.13 Proprioception and the continued engagement of other senses means that \nperception continues and feeds back the effect of gesture \u2013 the tightness of a nut or \nbolt is felt through the tool and the gesture that works on it.  \n5. Continuation: A single gesture is seldom sufficient to realise an intention (pressing \nthe \u201eon\u201f button may be enough) so most gestures lead to repetitions or further \ngestures to achieve an accumulating effect in transforming the object. There is often \na continuation of gesture that may not require a fresh intention or further \ninterpretation of signs. \nThe presence of these pragmatic features produces the complexity of material interaction \nthrough which humans perceive and manipulate things in accord with their culture. It is very \n  - 15 - \ndifficult to pick up a spanner you haven\u201ft first seen and picking up a spanner without \nintending to would be meaningless and suggest an unusual mental state! Even when \nhumans react \u201eintuitively\u201f or \u201ehabitually\u201f, apparently without conscious awareness, they are \ntypically responding to perceptions with preformed sequences of gesture based on prior \nintention. There is always an asymmetry between humans and objects in material interaction \n(unlike the turn-taking reciprocity of conversation) because intentionality within the object is \nsometime in the past whereas intentionality of the human subject is focussed in the present. \nDespite the rapid increase in \u201eintelligent\u201f objects with motors, memories, sensors, \nprogrammes and communicating systems, material interaction between humans and objects \nstill follows the principle of perception and gesture. The intentionality designed into objects \nhas always had the potential to shape the actions of humans that interact with them \u2013 \nhandles \u201einvite\u201f being handled, chairs \u201einvite\u201f being sat on (Mead 1962: 186). Human \nperception \u201ereads\u201f the state of the object and gesture at least initiates the work that changes \nthe physical world \u2013 even if it is no more than touching a screen (Dant 2005: 132, Fig 6.18).  \nConclusions \nWhat this paper has argued is that material interaction involves an exchange of meaning \nbetween human beings and objects that is amenable to analysis independently of talk during \nor about the interaction. Human beings \u201eread\u201f what objects mean by engaging with them \nthrough their senses \u2013 this sort of reading does not involve a formal language that can be \nseparated from the objects, but involves perceptual engagement with objects in their current \nstate and relations with each other. The consumer reads the intentions designed into objects \nand groups of objects and acts on them with appropriate gestures to bring about her or his \npurposes. Cultural knowledge of different types and workings of objects is brought into play \nbut in order for material things to fit in with human purposes, the pragmatic meaning of \nobjects must be read as contingent on their current situation and the changes they undergo \nunder the force of human and other actions. Pragmatic analysis of material interaction \ninvolves attending to a number of subsidiary processes that I have suggested include; \nintentionality, perception, orientation, manipulation and continuation of an action. The \ncultural knowledge necessary for engaging in material interaction has to be learnt and is \nusually acquired through practices of demonstration, mimicry, instruction, advice and so on. \nAs Merleau-Ponty says, \u201eit is clear that a child who had never seen an article of clothing \nwould not know how to act with clothing\u201f (1983: 170) \u2013 children learn, as do we all, what \nobjects mean and what they are for through engaging with them in use within the culture.  \n  - 16 - \nDesigned and made objects derive their meaning from how they fit in with human intentions \nwhich were anticipated when the object was formed: \u201eTo use a human object is always more \nor less to embrace and assume for one\u201fs self the meaning of the work which produced it\u201f \n(Merleau-Ponty 1983: 170). Designers utter objects to be situated in semantic and \nsyntactical relationships with other objects that already exist within the culture and the \nconsumer realises the meaning intended in their design by taking them up in material \ninteraction. The stuff of material culture then is amenable to being read by consumers \u2013 at \nleast, by those humans experienced in the appropriate material culture \u2013 as having particular \npotentials for interaction and use and as being amenable to particular gestures, skills, habits \nand practices. The human capacity for interacting with objects \u2013 to both produce and \nconsume them \u2013 is acquired over the life-course and held in the body in the same way as \nother knowledge such as the capacity to use language.14  \nMuch like ordinary conversation, the pragmatics of material interaction with spanners and \nflat-pack furniture seems banal because we successfully achieve this sort of interaction all \nthe time with little thought \u2013 this is what Barthes calls the \u201eobstacle of the obvious\u201f (Barthes \n1983: 184). However, the part that objects play in our lives helps to make our lives culturally \nwhat they are, partly through the symbolic associations they have, but also through the sorts \ngestures, actions and practices that they entail. These practices, which seem to us to be \nmerely functional in terms of meeting needs, are sociologically significant as they locate us \nin particular cultures at particular times, and in relations with other people both near and far \n(Miller 1987, Dant 1999, Shove 2003).  \nTim Dant, 20.08.07  \n \n \n  - 17 - \nReferences: \nBarthes, Roland (1983) The Semiotic Challenge, Oxford: Basil Blackwell. \nBarthes, Roland (1973) Elements of Semiology, New York: Hill and Wang. \nBarthes, Roland (1990 [1967]) The Fashion System, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University \nof California Press. \nChaiklin, Seth & Lave, Jean (eds.)

However they occur after formal production is complete and it is the consumer who takes \nresponsibility for these activities as part of what is entailed in consumption. So the car technician is a \nservice worker doing \u201econsumption\u201f work on behalf of the owner (unless he is doing warranty work on \nbehalf of the manufacturer). Consumption involves more than simply the purchase of goods \u2013 as \nMcCracken (1990, 83-87) pointed out there are a range of \u201eritual\u201f activities that the consumer \nundertakes as part of using or using up a commodity. \n4\n I will use \u201ethe designer\u201f here while recognising that almost all design is a team process such that it \nwould be very difficult to ever identify the designer. The connection with manufacture means that \nproduction engineers are a part of the design process and design might more usefully be thought of \nas \u201edesign and manufacture\u201f. The aspect of design that is important here is the application of thought \nand planning to the process of material interaction in use. \n5\n The group is led by Christian Heath and core members include Paul Luff, Jon Hindmarsh and Dirk \nvom Lehn. \n6\n I am greatful to Jon Hindmarsh and to the three anonymous referees for the Journal of Consumer \nCulture for reading earlier drafts and reminding me of the breadth of this literature and the variety of \nits approaches. \n7\n The utterance \u201cMeet me here in a week from now with a stick about this big\u201d is a sentence in which \nthe meaning is very unclear even though it is syntactically and semantically coherent. As Levinson \nputs it: \u201eWe don\u201ft know who to meet, where or when to meet him or her, or how big a stick to bring\u201f \n(1983: 55). The utterance depends on pointing to its context of utterance to answering these \nquestions of meaning and no amount of interrogation of the semantic basis of the words or their \nsyntactical relations will provide answers. Both Suchman and the WIT group have demonstrated with \nempirical analyses how the material context of a situation is incorporated into linguistic exchange \nthrough indexicality; language use makes reference to material stuff that is necessary for it to make \nsense. \n8\n Maurice Merleau-Ponty distinguishes the child\u201fs response \u2013 which is to attempt to understand the \nmeaning of the object through its cultural milieu \u2013 from that of the monkey, which never goes beyond \na functional relationship with the object (1983: 169-175).  \n  - 24 - \n                                                                                                                                                  \n9\n Of course these meanings have changed radically since Barthes was writing (originally in 1964) \u2013 \ncoloured plastics, including creams and have become much cheaper to produce so the connotations \nof luxury and femininity have to be carried by other features of appearance and use. \n10\n Husserl says \u201eCognitive mental processes (and this belongs to their essence) have an intentio, they \nrefer to something, they are related in this or that way to an object\u201f (1973 :43). Merleau-Ponty takes \nintentionality further than being a cognitive process that is directed to something: \u201eWhat distinguishes \nintentionality from the Kantian relation to a possible object is that the unity of the world, before being \nposited by knowledge in a specific act of identification, is \u201elived\u201f as ready-made or already there\u201f \n(1962: xvii). It is through language and cultural experience that intentionality is able to be directed to \nsomething and there are \u201eseveral sorts of intention\u201f \u2013 desire, will, fear \u2013 that are not necessarily \nreducible to representation (Merleau-Ponty 1983: 172). The complexity of intentionality for Merleau-\nPonty, is nicely put when he says \u201econsciousness is a network of significative intentions which are \nsometimes clear to themselves and sometimes, on the contrary, lived rather than known\u201f (1983: 173).  \n11\n Leroi-Gourhan\u201fs use of the term gesture is not limited to bodily actions that have no purpose other \nthan to communicate meaning directly between humans. He uses the term, sometimes as \u201etechnical \ngesture\u201f, to point to the meaningfulness of actions in relation to things, especially tools, that are not \ninstinctive but acquired through culture\u201fs shaping of what the body can do, e.g. \u201eThe complex actions \nof grasping, handling and kneading which already existed at the primitive anthropological stage still \naccount for a large share of our technical gestures today.\u201f (Leroi-Gourhan 1993: 242). \n12\n \u201eNow reasoning has to make its conclusions manifest. Therefore, it must be chiefly concerned with \nforms, which are the chief objects of rational insight. Accordingly, Icons are specially requisite for \nreasoning. A Diagram is mainly an Icon, and an Icon of intelligible relations.\u201f (Peirce 252) \n13\n \u201eIt is by design that, instead of speaking of action as do most contemporary psychologists, we \nchoose the Hegelian term \u201cwork\u201d, which designates the ensemble of activities by which man \ntransforms physical and living nature\u201f (Merleau-Ponty 1983: 162).  \n14\n For example, Doug Harper (1987) describes how Willie, a local jobbing engineer, reads the signs of \nheat in the colour of the metal he is welding, and is able to fine tune his gestural response of applying \nmore or less heat, water or ice to temper and shape it for the purpose he intends. Harper calls this \n\u201ekinesthetic knowledge\u201f that is learnt as a child and built on throughout life (Harper 1987: 133). \n"}
