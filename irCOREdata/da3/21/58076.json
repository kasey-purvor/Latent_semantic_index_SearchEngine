Introduction  \nAcid deposition, originating mainly from man made emissions of SO2, NOx and NH3 \nhas had significant ecological and economic consequences, especially during the last two \ndecades of the 20th century, affecting forests, soil and freshwater ecosystems in large areas of \nEurope (Posch et al., 1997; EEA, 1998; Berge et al., 1999; Davies et al., 2004; Vuorenmaa, \n2004; B\u0142a\u015b et al., 2008; Fagerli et al., 2008). The total area affected by exceedance of \nacidifying sulphur and nitrogen on a European scale was about 20% in the mid eighties \n(Posch et al., 1997; Berge et al., 1999; Mill et al., 2003). \nIn many countries depositions and concentrations to a large extent originate from \nsources outside the countries themselves and it is necessary to assess the changes on a larger \nscale, taking into account the trans-boundary fluxes (Fowler et al., 2007). Hence the problems \nof acidification have been addressed internationally by the 1979 Geneva Convention on Long \nRange Trans-boundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and two protocols targeting sulphur emission \nreductions have been signed in Europe (Berge et al., 1999). As a result of international \npollutant abatement policy and structural changes in industrial sector, substantial reductions in \ngaseous emissions have been observed, with SO2 being reduced most significantly. Land \nbased sulphur emissions from 1970 to 2005 declined by between 90 and 70% depending on \nthe region of Europe (Fowler et al., 2007). Larger reductions were found in the area of the \nformer Soviet Union and western Europe than in central eastern Europe (Berge et al., 1999; \nMitosek et al., 2004). For oxidized and reduced nitrogen the overall European reductions from \n1980 to 2003 were between 20 and 50%. Both oxidized and reduced nitrogen emissions fell \nmore in eastern Europe than in western Europe (Fowler et al., 2005; Fagerli et al., 2008). \nAir pollution emissions of SO2 and NOx have decreased in the UK significantly during recent \ndecades due to active control measures and economic changes. There were large changes in \nthe power industry sector where coal was changed for gas and abatement facilities were \n3 \n \n \ninstalled. The deposition of sulphur and nitrogen in the UK has declined since the peak in \nemission in 1970 by 50% and 16%, respectively (NEGTAP, 2001; Fowler et al., 2005). \nEmissions of NH3 have changed little since the peak emissions in the mid 1980\u2019s, but a \ndecline of 12% relative to 1990 is expected by 2010 (EMEP, 2006). \nHere attention is focused on non-linearities in the relationship between the emission \nand deposition changes. The national reduction in deposition is clearly smaller than the \nreduction in emission and it also leads to slower reductions in critical loads exceedance in \nremote areas than may be expected (NEGTAP, 2001; Irwin et al., 2002; Fournier et al., 2004). \nNon-linearities for sulphur emission-deposition patterns in the UK can be explained by \nincreases in emissions from international shipping, changes in atmospheric oxidation rates \nand complex interactions between the different pollutants which can influence deposition \nrates (i.e. the co-deposition of NH3 and SO2 ; Fowler et al., 2007). Mayerhofer et al. (2002) \nconcluded that for regional air pollution the development of the air pollutant emissions is \nmore important than the effect of climate change on the dispersion and chemical \ntransformation of air pollutants. Fagerli and Aas (2008) investigated the role of sulphur in the \nemission-deposition relationship of oxidized and reduced nitrogen and to what extent the \nreductions of SO2 emissions have influenced the trends of the nitrogen compounds.  \nThe UK Lagrangian trajectory models such as HARM (Metcalfe et al., 2001), TRACK (Lee \net al., 2000) and FRAME (the Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutants Exchange \nmodel; Singles et al., 1998) have been developed to asses acid deposition to sensitive areas. \nThese models use a spatial emissions inventory and give deposition at grid squares throughout \nthe UK at a 5km x 5 km resolution.  \nIn this paper we consider recent trends in emissions of SO2, NOx and NH3 and \ncompare the model with measurements from the UK national monitoring network for wet \ndeposition of sulphate, nitrate and ammonium during the period 1990-2005. A longer time \n4 \n \n \nseries covering a 50 year period from 1970, the earliest year for which a detailed emissions \ninventory for the UK is available, to year 2020, based on detailed emissions projections, is \nconsidered and an assessment of the associated changes in nitrogen and sulphur deposition \nand exceedance of acid and nitrogen critical loads for acid deposition and nutrient nitrogen \ndeposition.  \n2. Data & methods \n2.1 FRAME model description \nA detailed description of the Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange \nmodel is provided by Singles et al. (1998), Fournier et al. (2005) and Dore et al. (2007). \nFRAME is a statistical atmospheric transport model that can be used to estimate the spatial \ndistribution of sulphur and nitrogen deposited to the United Kingdom. FRAME simulates the \nmain atmospheric processes (emission, diffusion, chemical transformations and deposition) \ntaking place in a column of air moving along straight-line trajectories following specified \nwind directions. The column is divided into 33 separate layers of varying thickness ranging \nfrom 1 m at the surface and increasing to 100 m at the top of the domain (ApSimon et al., \n1994). Vertical mixing is described using K-theory eddy diffusivity and solved with a finite \nvolume method (Vieno, 2005). \nThe FRAME domain covers the UK and the Republic of Ireland with a grid resolution \nof 5 km x 5 km and grid dimension of 172 x 244. Input gas and aerosol concentrations at the \nedge of the model domain are calculated with FRAME-Europe, a large scale European \nversion of FRAME-UK which runs on the EMEP grid at a 50 km resolution. Trajectories are \nadvected across the domain, with different starting angles at a 1 degree resolution, using \ndirectionally dependent wind speed and wind frequency roses. The wind speed rose employed \nin FRAME uses radiosonde data (Dore et al., 2006) but the wind frequency rose is based on \n5 \n \n \nthe Jenkinson objective classification of circulation type which has superseded the Lamb \nweather classification (Lamb, 1972; www.cru.uea.ac.uk\/cru\/data\/lwt.htm).  \nAs the air column moves along the trajectory, chemical interactions between \nammonia, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides take place. The chemical scheme applied in the \nmodel includes gas and aqueous phase reactions and is similar to that applied in the EMEP \nLagrangian model (Barret and Seland, 1995). Dry deposition is calculated by determining a \nvegetation-dependent deposition velocity (Vd) to each chemical species derived from a dry \ndeposition model (Smith et al., 2000). The following land classes are considered: forest, \ngrassland, moorland, arable, urban and water. Values of Vd are calculated for each land use \ncategory using a canopy resistance model (Singles et al., 1998). Wet deposition is determined \nwith scavenging coefficients and a constant drizzle approach. An increased washout rate is \nassumed over hill areas due to the seeder-feeder effect. It is assumed that the washout rate for \nthe orographic component of rainfall is twice that used for the non-orographic components \n(Dore et al., 1992).  \nTo take into account changes in chemical climate, the concentration ratio SO2:NH3 is \nused to calculate the canopy resistance for deposition of SO2. Long term measurements of the \ndeposition velocity of SO2 at Auchencorth Moss in Scotland and Speulder Forest in the \nNetherlands show a generally increasing trend as the acidity of the environment has declined \ndue to reductions in SO2 emissions during the last decade (Fowler et al, 2007). \n A simple linear correlation is assumed in the FRAME: \nRc = 50 * ([SO2]\/[NH3]) \nWhere [SO2] and [NH3] are the concentrations of SO2 and NH3 in air by mass respectively \nThe deposition velocity of SO2 was calculated according to the equation: \nVd(SO2) = (Ra + Rb + Rc)-1 \n6 \n \n \nRa \u2013 aerodynamic resistance, due to turbulent diffusion of material to the roughness elements \nof the surface \nRb \u2013 laminar boundary layer resistance, describes the transfer due to molecular diffusion \nthrough the quasi-laminar layer around the roughness elements \nRc \u2013 surface resistance, describes the ability of the surface itself to capture airborne material \nand is dependant on the nature of the surface \nThe decrease of the [SO2]: [NH3] ratio is responsible for the increase of the SO2 deposition \nvelocity. Due to emissions reductions, the depletion of atmospheric oxidants became less of a \ncontrolling factor in determining the rate of conversion of pre-cursor gases to sulphate and \nnitrate aerosol (which make a major contribution to wet deposition).  \n2.2 Meteorological model inputs (1990-2005) \nPrecipitation data used in the modelling is generated by interpolation of measurements \nfrom the tipping bucket rain gauges gathered at the Meteorological Office national network \non approximately 5000 stations. The data are in the form of annual rainfall fields for the UK \nand Ireland on a 5km x 5km grid. The national mean annual precipitation was 1130 mm for \nthe period 1990-2005 and ranged from 880 mm in 2003 to 1330 mm in 2000. The years 1998, \n2000 and 2002 were wet years while 1996 and 2003 were dry, relative to the mean for the \nperiod.  \nA higher precipitation amount is noticed at the western coastal and at higher altitude \nsites. However, during the wet year (2000), areas of hilly regions with precipitation above \n2000 mm year-1 are considerably larger. The substantial enhancement in rainfall with altitude \ncan be partially explained with the seeder\u2013feeder enhancement mechanism, whereby rain \nfalling from a higher level cloud (seeder cloud) layer passes through an orographically formed \n7 \n \n \n\u201ccap cloud\u201d (feeder cloud) over high terrain (Carruthers and Choularton 1983, B\u0142a\u015b et al., \n1999). As it passes through the cap cloud, the rain scavenges cloud droplets, adding to the \nrainfall amount and ion content. The concentration is enhanced since cloud droplets are much \nsmaller than rain drops and are thus far more concentrated for a given aerosol loading (e.g. \nChoularton et al. 1988, Dore et al. 1992, Inglis and Choularton 2000). \nWind direction frequency information was taken from the classification of Lamb-\nJenkinson weather types (Lamb, 1972; Hulme & Barrow, 1997). The classification consists of \ntwo parts: wind direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, N and unclassified) and circulation \ntype (cyclonic, anti-cyclonic & unclassified). In Fig. 1, three wind frequency roses are \nplotted: average for the period 1990-2005, and individual for 1996 and 2004.  \n \nFig. 1. The 1990-2005 average wind frequency rose compared to 1996 and 2004 wind frequency roses. Radial \nunits are percent per 15o direction band (%) \n \nThe years 1996 and 2004 were selected for presentation because they are \nrepresentative for low and high wind frequency from E+SE+S directions within the \nconsidered period, respectively. The average wind rose illustrates that predominant wind \n8 \n \n \ndirections are from the SW-W. The individual wind roses show a greater incidence of \neasterlies in 1996 and westerlies in 2004.  \nTo prepare the wind speed rose radiosonde data has been used.  In order to sample \ndata from different geographical locations, four stations were selected in the British Isles. The \nselection criteria for data were based upon: the existence of a complete ten year data set, \nGeographical representation of the northern, southern, western and eastern limits of the \nBritish Isles. These were: Camborne (south-west England); Hemsby (east coast of England); \nStornoway (north-west Scotland) and Valentia (on the west coast of the Republic of Ireland). \nAs suggested by Dore et al., 2006, one wind speed rose \u2013 a harmonic mean for the period has \nbeen used in the model. \n2.3 Emission inventory used in modelling \nIn order to calculate past and future deposition of sulphur and nitrogen to the UK, it is \nnecessary to generate historical and forecast emissions maps. Although some historical \nemissions maps are available (i.e. for the year 1990), much of these data are incompatible \nwith more recent emissions data as they are gridded at a coarser resolution (10 km for 1990 \nand 1 km for 2005) and are lacking in separate information on point source emissions. In \nestimating the temporal trends in deposition to the UK, it is important for input emissions data \nfor different years to be identically formatted otherwise artificial changes in modelled \ndeposition may be generated. The background and point source emissions files for the year \n2002 were taken to be the baseline year. The data for total emissions were used to scale \nemissions backwards in time and generate new emissions files for the years 1970, 1980, 1990-\n2001. Emissions from the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI, www.naei.org) \nwere used for 2003, 2004 and 2005. Future emissions for the years 2010 and 2020 were \nobtained by scaling the 2005 emissions data forward in time. The future emissions projections \nfor the UK for the years 2010 and 2020 were based on those from the Air Quality Strategy \n9 \n \n \n(Grice et al., 2005). Area emissions data were divided into eight different SNAP codes \n(Selected Nomenclature for Air Pollution). Year-dependent scaling factors were assigned to \neach SNAP emission sector. The UK NH3 emissions for the years 1970 and 1980 were set at \nthe 1990 level. Emissions from the Republic of Ireland are also included explicitly in the \nFRAME domain and these were scaled backwards in time in a similar manner to the UK \nemissions. Future emissions for the years 2010 and 2020 for the Republic of Ireland were set \nat the levels defined by the National Emissions Ceiling Directive (NECD). Emissions of SO2 \nand NOx from international shipping were also included in the domain. These were scaled \nforwards and backwards in time from the baseline year 2000 according to estimates from the \nNAEI. Globally, shipping emissions of SO2 are estimated to be increasing at a rate of between \n2.5% and 1.5% per year (Endressen et al., 2003; Corbett et al, 2003). Here we have adopted \nthe figure of 2.5%. Considerable uncertainty however remains both in the spatial distribution \nof shipping emissions and in their magnitude and regional rate of change. The emissions \n(ENTEC 2002) were gridded on the EMEP 50 km grid. Future work will focus on \nimplementation of higher resolution shipping emissions data at a 5 km resolution in the \nmodel. The relative contribution of shipping emissions within the FRAME-UK domain to \ntotal sulphur and nitrogen deposition in the UK has increased from 5% to 23% and from 11% \nto 21% respectively over the period 1990-2005. However the imposition of Annex VI of the \nMARPOL convention will restrict the sulphur content of bunker fuel to 0.1% in the North Sea \nresulting in major reductions in SO2 emissions by the year 2020. \nFuture emissions were generated assuming that shipping emissions in the UK waters \nare compliant with the IMO directive to reduce the sulphur content of bunker fuel to 0.5% in \nthe North Sea by the year 2020 as well as the gradual introduction of low NOx emitting \nengines. The contribution of shipping emissions to sulphur deposition in the UK is discussed \nin detail in Dore et al. (2007).  \n10 \n \n \n2.4 Model evaluation \nAs the aim of the paper is related with the deposition trends, the model results are \nevaluated in two ways. First, the results are compared with the available measurements. \nSecond, FRAME modelled data are compared against the CBED (Concentration Based \nEstimated Deposition; Smith et al. (2000, 2001)) wet deposition data which is generated from \nmeasurements from the national monitoring networks of gas concentrations in air and ion \nconcentrations in precipitation. CBED dry and wet deposition forms the official UK data set \nfor estimation of exceedance of critical loads for acid deposition and nitrogen deposition. \nUnfortunately, long term dry deposition is only measured directly at a very few sites in the \nUK, which means a direct model-measurement comparison of dry deposition is not feasible. \nModelled gas concentrations (SO2, NO2, NH3, HNO3) have been compared with \nmeasurements in Dore et al. (2006) and were shown to give satisfactory agreement. \nContinuous monitoring of these compounds was started in the late 1990s and forms a shorter \ndata series than that for wet deposition. In this paper we focus on comparison with \nmeasurements of wet deposition during the period 1990-2005. For this period, the wet \ndeposition network contains 32 stations, which are located away from major local sources of \ncontamination and are in rural locations. \nTwo error measures are used for the evaluation of the FRAME modelled wet \ndeposition: mean bias (MB) and mean absolute error (MAE). MB is commonly used to \ndescribe the general over or underestimation by the model, while MAE gives information on \naverage error (Chang and Hanna, 2004; Yu et al., 2006). The MB and MAE statistics are \nsupported by the correlation coefficient (R) and regression analysis between modelled and \nmeasured wet deposition, which are performed for each year of the 1990 \u2013 2005 period. \n3. Results and discussion \n11 \n \n \n Modelled wet deposition results were compared against measured values. All the \ncorrelations are statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) as well as slopes and intercept value \nfor linear regression are reasonable. The results for SO42-, give a correlation coefficient in the \nrange of 0.60 to 0.83. Similar correlation coefficients are obtained for NH4+ and NO3- but with \nbetter results for intercept values.  \n For SO42- and NO3- Mean Bias and Mean Absolute Error are higher at the beginning of \nthe analyzed period and after these values clearly go down. MB goes down from 4.16 in 1990 \nto 0.70 in 2004 for SO42-, from 1.08 to (-0.43) for NO3-, and MAE from 5.20 to 1.8, 1.62 to \n1.54, respectively. The improvement of these statistics during the second part of the period \ncan be attributed to the improvement in emissions inventory. In case of NH4+, the downward \ntrend is not clear, despite the fact that MB is the smallest for year 2005. MAE amounts to \nabout 1.80 \u2013 2.00 and MB is close to 1. \nFig. 2(a)-(c) illustrate the correlation with measurements of modelled NH4+, NO3-, \nSO42- wet deposition for 2005. For SO42- the model performs particularly well against \nmeasurements for low deposition and somewhat overestimates higher values (which usually \noccurs in hilly regions). For NO3- and NH4+  lower deposition is also represented better, with \nthe number of points above\/below 2:1 and 1:2 reference lines being lower than for higher \ndeposition values, which appears both as overestimations and underestimations.  \nOverestimation usually occurs in hilly regions and might be due to the simple \nparameterization of the seeder-feeder effects, which is currently based on the long term \nprecipitation data. For mountainous stations accurate estimates of precipitation amount are \nespecially crucial for determination of pollutant deposition. Underestimations are especially \nevident for stations situated close to coastal zone. This could be a consequence of a limitation \nof the FRAME-Europe model which is used to generate conditions at the edge of FRAME \ndomain by considering straight-line trajectories. This approach does not allow air from \n12 \n \n \nemission sources to be trapped in cyclonic conditions and so to come back to the precipitation \npart of the depression (Fournier et al., 2004). \n \nFig. 2. Correlation of modelled wet deposition with measurements from the national monitoring network for \n2005: a) SO42-, b) NO3-,c) NH4+,. Solid line is the best fit line produced by a regression analysis, dashed lines are \nfor reference: 2:1, 1:2 and 1:1 division \n \nComparison of the model with measurements shows that FRAME gives reasonable \nagreement with measurements. The second part of the validation is the country deposition \nbudget comparison. The FRAME wet deposition budgets for the UK show reductions of 132 \nGg S-SOx yr-1, 15 Gg N-NOy yr-1 and 19 Gg N-NHx yr-1 over the period 1990-2005 (Fig. 3). \n13 \n \n \nThere is a very good fit between modelled and measured lines, especially for the second part \nof the period, for which emission data are more precise. FRAME tends to constantly give \nhigher values for SOx deposition, and lower for NOy in comparison to measurements. There is \nno general rule for NHx, which can be over and underestimated in different years. The highest \ndifferences between modelled and measured data are for NOy, and the lowest for NHx. \nFig. 3. Modelled and measured UK national wet deposition budget for: S-SOx, N-NOy, N-NHx (Gg) \n \n3.1 Trends in emissions \nUK emissions of S-SO2, N-NOx and N-NH3 are presented in Fig. 4. There have been \nsignificant reductions in S-SO2 emissions since 1970, the emission in 2005 representing 89% \nreduction on the 1970 value. These have been caused by fuel switching from coal to gas, and \nthe installation of abatement equipment (flue gas desulphurisation) at power stations. \n \n14 \n \n \nMeasures to abate emissions of SO2 have proved to be highly effective. Significant reductions \nare also evident from other sources, most notably Industrial and Residential Combustion . \nThis is caused by the increased use of gas in place of coal. \nEmission projections are available for selected years to 2020, and are expected to be \ndriven by the extent to which coal is used in public electricity generation. The current \nprojection for 2010 shows that the UK is expected to achieve the ceiling of 293 Gg S-SO2 \nrequired by the European Commissions National Emissions Ceilings Directive (NECD). \nEstimates for 2020 indicate a 50% reduction on the 2005 emission total. Emission estimates \nof SO2 are considered to be relatively low in uncertainty (\u00b14%). This is because the most \nimportant datasets for making the emissions estimates (mass of fuel, and the corresponding \nsulphur content) are considered to be well characterised.  \n \nFig. 4. Trend in UK emissions of S-SO2, N-NOx, N-NH3 (Gg) \n \nThere have been significant reductions in emissions of N-NOx (as N-NO2) from a number of \nsources, the decrease from 1970 to 2005 representing a reduction of 48%. The largest \n15 \n \n \nemission reduction has been from Passenger Cars. This is due to the introduction of three-\nway-catalysts in the late 1990\u2019s and subsequently a number of increasingly stringent emission \nstandards. More recently emission standards have also been introduced for heavy duty \nvehicles. Emissions from power generation have also reduced, primarily due to the increased \nuse of gas over coal fired stations. Gas fired power stations emit less NOx, and are typically \nmore efficient. Recent years have shown a slight increase in NOx emissions from power \ngeneration. This is because coal has been used in favour of gas, driven by a more attractive \nfuel price.  \nUntil recently emission projections had indicated that the UK was on target to meet \nthe NECD of  346 Gg N-NOx. However, current emission projections for 2010 show that this \nis not the case. This change has been caused by the re-evaluation of emissions from new cars \nentering the vehicle fleet which complied with a particular emissions standard. Originally \nemission estimates were based on studies undertaken on rolling roads in the laboratory. \nHowever more recent real world testing has shown that these vehicles do not provide the \nreductions previously thought. As a result the emission estimate for 2010 was revised and \nincreased, taking it above the NECD target for 2010. Emission estimates for 2020 indicate a \n51% reduction on the 2005 UK emissions total.  \n Emissions are presented as NOx (as NO2 equivalent), and as such do not provide a true \nindication of the NO2 emissions. It is known that the NO2:NOx ratio of emissions has \nincreased in recent years for a number of reasons. The most important reasons in recent years \nthat could affect the NO2\/NOx emissions ratio have been the programme of fitting diesel \nparticulate filters (DPSs) to buses. It was reported that emission of NO2: NOx increased from \n5% without a CDPF to 15-20% (DRSTA, 2002). Another factor is the increased use of diesel \ncars. It is known that diesel vehicles tend to have a higher NO2:NOx emission ratio, \nparticularly under low engine load conditions (Carslaw, 2005; AQEG, 2004). This has meant \n16 \n \n \nthat measures taken to reduce NOx emissions have not resulted in the reduction in NO2 \nconcentrations which were anticipated. Levels of NOx from combustion sources are heavily \ndependent on a range of combustion parameters. As a result uncertainties are higher. The UK \nNOx emission totals are quoted with an uncertainty of \u00b110%.  \nEmission estimates of N-NH3 are only presented for 1990 onwards as data is incomplete prior \nto this. Emissions of NH3 are dominated by agricultural activities, and cattle manure \nmanagement in particular. There are numerous national policies in place to manage nitrogen \nemissions from the agricultural sector. However, it has proved difficult to have any significant \nimpact on NH3 emissions from this politically sensitive source sector. Whilst the reduction in \nemissions of N-NH3 observed in Fig. 4, is not as large as that for S-SO2 or N-NOx, there was \nan 18% reduction from 1990 to 2006. This has primarily been driven by a decrease in \nlivestock numbers, changes to animal diet and improvements to manure management. \nEmissions of NH3 are high in uncertainty, the UK emissions total being quoted as \u00b120%. So, \nwhilst the current best estimate for 2010 (242 Gg N-NH3) does give a total which is lower \nthan the 2010 NECD target (245 Gg N-NH3), the uncertainty range does extend above the \nceiling. \nThe FRAME model was run for the year 2005 firstly with all emissions sources, secondly \nwith European emissions removed, and thirdly with shipping emissions removed (in both the \nEuropean and UK simulations). These simulations allowed assessment of the relative \ncontribution of UK emissions, shipping emissions and European emissions to deposition of \nsulphur and nitrogen in the UK. The FRAME results have been compared with the EMEP \nsource-receptor matrices for the year 2005.  \nThese calculations showed that with FRAME 22% of sulphur deposition was attributed to \nEuropean sources and 19% to international shipping. This showed good agreement with \nEMEP figures of 25% and 19% respectively. For NOy deposition FRAME attributed 15% of \n17 \n \n \ndeposition to shipping and 27% to European sources (EMEP 18% and 40% respectively). For \nNHx, FRAME attributed 30% of deposition to European sources compared with 27% for \nEMEP. \n3.2 Recent trends in deposition of sulphur and nitrogen (1990-2005) \nOver the period 1990-2005 modelled total (wet + dry) deposition in the UK decreased \nfrom 413 to 157 Gg S-SOx yr-1. For nitrogen, annual total deposition decreased from 176 to \n148 Gg for N-NOy and from 193 to 169 Gg if reduced nitrogen is considered. These figures \naccount for 62%, 16% and 12% decreases in total deposition of SOx, NOy and NHx \nrespectively. Dry deposition declined more than wet for SOx but for NOy and NHx the \npercentage changes of wet and dry deposition were almost the same. During the early nineties \nwet deposition comprised 57%, 54%, 63% of total deposition of SOx, NOy, and NHx, \nrespectively, in 2005 the value increased by some 10% for SOx and has not changed \nsignificantly for NOy and NHx. \nFig. 5, 6, 7 show percentage change in UK average annual precipitation, national \nemissions and wet deposition of SOx, NOy, NHx normalised against a 1990 baseline. The \nresults suggest that wet deposition has decreased less quickly than emissions. Wet deposition \ndecreased between 1990 and 2005 by 55% for SOx and by about 16% for NOy and NHx, \nwhereas the reduction in emission for SOx and NOy was significantly higher (by 77%, 47%, \nrespectively) and by 18% for NHx. The changes in emission and deposition are not closely \ncorrelated. There are some years, especially for NOy and NHx, where emissions have \ndecreased but wet deposition increases. Comparing the years 1993-1997, emissions of NOy \ndecreased by about 15 to 30% relative to 1990, while wet deposition is higher on average by \n10% than in 1990. A similar situation is observed for NHx. If the two driest years (1996 and \n2003) are compared, there is a good agreement between emission and deposition for 2003 but \nnot for 1996. This can be explained by inter-annual variation of meteorology conditions. As \n18 \n \n \ndiscussed above, the period 1993-1997 was characterized by a high frequency of E-SE-S wind \ndirections (the most polluted sector). The lack of linearity in changing of emission and \ndeposition has been explained by other authors (Irwin et al., 2002; Fournier et al., 2004; Hall \net al., 2006). This was attributed to a number of factors including increases in emissions from \ninternational shipping, changing in European emission and changing rates of atmospheric \noxidation. During the years 1990-2005, when the larges changes of emission occurred, when \nUK emission of SOx, NOx, NHx decreased by 77%, 47% and 18% respectively, European \nemissions showed similar trends, with decreases of 66%, 30% and 21%, respectively. These \nchanges influence the ratio of pollutants imported to national emissions but indicate that the \nrelative contribution of imported pollutants from Europe to the UK has not been subject to \nlarge changes. \n \nFig. 5.

Long term trends in deposition and exceedances of critical loads of sulphur and \nnitrogen (1970-2020) \nThe deposition of sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen calculated by FRAME for \nthe year 1970 is illustrated in Fig. 8(a) \u2013 (f). These can be compared with deposition maps for \n20 \n \n \na future year (2020, Fig. 9 (a) \u2013 (f)). A striking change in deposition is apparent during the 50 \nyear time period. For sulphur, both dry and wet deposition in 1970 exceeded 20 kg S ha-1 yr-1 \nin much of the country. By the year 2005, dry deposition exceeds 5 kg S ha-1 yr-1 only in some \nindustrial areas of northern England and in the south-east although many areas have wet \ndeposition of sulphur in excess of 5 kg S ha-1 yr-1. By 2020, only a restricted region receives \nannual deposition in excess of 5 kg S ha-1 yr-1, corresponding to the high rainfall areas of the \nPennines and the some coastal regions which are strongly influenced by shipping emissions. \nA similar pattern is apparent for NOy deposition. Upland regions and areas influenced by \nvehicle emissions are subject to deposition (both wet and dry) in excess of 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1. \nBy 2020 the regions where deposition exceeds 5 kg N ha-1 yr-1 are restricted to a small \nnumber of coastal sites, urban regions and some upland sites. For NHx deposition, the changes \nare generally smaller during the 50 year time period due to much smaller reductions in \nemissions. \n21 \n \n \n \nFig. 8.

FRAME 2020 deposition: a) SOx dry; b) SOx wet; c) NOy dry; d) NOy wet; e) NHx dry f) NHx wet (kg S \nor N ha-1 yr-1) \n \n23 \n \n \nA description of the methods used to derive and calculate critical loads is given in Hall et al. \n(2003). The exceedances of critical loads of acidity and nutrient nitrogen across the UK were \ncalculated using the FRAME data for 1970, 2005 and 2020. The significant reduction in the \nareas with exceedance is mapped in Fig. 10 (a) and (b). The larges changes are noticed close \nto the emission sources, whereas in hilly regions there are large exceedances also in 2020. For \nacidity, the habitat areas with deposition exceeding critical loads are seen to fall significantly \nbetween 1970 and 2020 (from 94% to 22% for dwarf shrub heath). However, for nutrient \nnitrogen, the percentage area of unmanaged forest exceeded falls only marginally, from 99% \nto 95% between 1970 and 2020 (Fig. 11). This is due to the dominant role of dry deposition of \nammonia to tall vegetation. The total area of sensitive UK habitats exceeded fell from 85% to \n37% for acidity and from 73% to 49% for nutrient nitrogen. \nReductions in acid deposition and total nitrogen deposition may provide the conditions \nin which chemical and biological recovery of sensitive habitats can begin, but the timescales \nof these processes are often very long relative to the timescales for reductions in emissions. \nThe study demonstrates the increasing relative importance of ammonia emissions in \ncontributing to eutrophication and acidification. Efforts to further reduce deposition of \nsulphur and nitrogen to the natural environment must include measures to control emissions \nof ammonia.  \n \n24 \n \n \nFig. 10.

Conclusion \nAn atmospheric transport model has been applied to assess the influence of reductions \nin emissions of pollutant gases (SO2, NOx, NH3) on sulphur and nitrogen deposition in the UK \nduring a 50 year time period (1970-2020). The results of the model were compared with \nmeasurements of wet deposition (SO42-, NO3-, NH4+) from the UK national monitoring \nnetwork covering the period 1990 to 2005. Both the model and the measurements showed that \nreductions in deposition during this 15 year period were less significant than the reductions in \nemissions. For the period 1990-2005 emissions decreased by 77% for SOx, 47% for NOy and \n18% for NHx, whereas the reduction in modelled wet deposition amounted to 55%, 16% and \n12%, respectively. This was attributed partly to the effect of import of pollutants to the UK \nfrom international shipping emissions which have increased significantly during recent years. \n26 \n \n \nThe large decrease in SO2 concentrations in the UK during recent decades has resulted in an \nincrease in the oxidising capacity of the atmosphere with the result that precursor gases (SO2 \nand NOx) can be more rapidly oxidised and converted to sulphate and nitrate aerosol. These \nparticulates play an important role in the long range transport of pollutants and deposition of \nsulphur and nitrogen, particularly in high rainfall upland areas. \nAnalysis of meteorological data showed that inter-annual variation of circulation \npatterns and precipitation played a significant role in causing year to year fluctuations in \ndeposition, such that deposition could increase in years with high annual precipitation or \nenhanced circulation from the polluted south-easterly sector. Such inter-annual variation in \nmeteorology can confound attempts to detect trends in deposition through measurement. Long \nterm data series of wet deposition of approximately two decades are required to measure \ndeposition trends. One advantage with a modelling approach is that it is possible to separate \nthe influence of emissions and meteorology on deposition by running simulations either with \nfixed meteorology and inter-annual variation in emissions or with inter-annual variation in \nboth emissions and meteorology. Future application of complex Eulerian atmospheric \ntransport models using detailed meteorological drivers and sophisticated photo-oxidation \nschemes is recommended for further studies in deposition trends. \nLong term trends in deposition modelled from 1970 to 2020 show that the large \ndecrease (95%) in emissions of SO2 from the UK during this period have resulted in \nsignificant decreases (87%) in total sulphur deposition and corresponding decreases to \nexceedance of critical loads (from 85% to 37% of area) to many vegetation types. Reductions \nin nitrogen deposition are smaller during this time period, in part due to relatively small \nreductions of ammonia emissions. Whilst the area of vegetation in the UK with exceedance of \ncritical loads for deposition to acid grassland, dwarf shrub heath and bog has shown \nimprovement, exceedance of deposition to unmanaged woodland remains high. Future \n27 \n \n \nreductions in exceedance of critical loads for nitrogen deposition will require application of \nfocused policy to abate emissions of ammonia from agricultural sources. \n \nAcknowledgement: \nThis work was funded by the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \nand the Natural Environment Research Council. \n \n \nReferences: \nApSimon, H.
