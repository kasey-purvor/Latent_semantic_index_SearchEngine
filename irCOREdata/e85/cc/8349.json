We \nexamined this question based on the premise that the optical information used for anticipation \nresides in the dynamic motion structures, or modes, inherent in the observed kinematic \npatterns. In Experiment 1, we analyzed whole-body movements of tennis shots to different \ndirections and distances by means of principal component analysis. The shots differed in the \nfew modes that captured most of the variance, especially as a function of shot direction. In \nExperiments 2 and 3, skilled and less skilled tennis players were asked to anticipate the \ndirection of simulated shots on the basis of kinematic patterns in which only the constituent \ndynamic structures were manipulated. The results indicated that players predicted shot \ndirection by picking up the information contained in multiple low-dimensional dynamic \nmodes, suggesting that anticipation skill (in tennis) entails the extraction of this dynamic \ninformation from high-dimensional displays. \n \nKey Words: coordination dynamics, information, expertise, anticipation, biological motion \nperception \nRunning head: Dynamic information for anticipation \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 3\nOn the dynamic information underlying visual anticipation skill \n Biological motion patterns contain information about the agent\u2019s identity, emotion, \nand intentions. For instance, people can tell the gender of someone walking in the absence of \nobvious cues (Troje, 2002). Emotions like anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness are \nreadily gleaned from bodily movements (Dittrich, Troscianko, Lea, & Morgan, 1996). \nSimilarly, skilled tennis and squash players can accurately predict where an opponent will \nplay the ball before it is actually hit (Abernethy, 1990; Williams, Ward, Knowles, & \nSmeeton, 2002). In these latter examples, well-trained individuals (i.e., domain-specific \nexperts) are more proficient in \u2018reading\u2019 the relevant information from an unfolding action \nthan novice observers. This skill-specific feature is particularly well documented for racket \nsports (cf. Smeeton, Williams, Hodges, & Ward, 2005; Williams, Davids, & Williams, 1999). \n In racket sports such as tennis, squash, and badminton, expert players are typically \nfaster and\/or more accurate in predicting the outcome of an opponent\u2019s action (e.g., the \ndirection and\/or depth of a serve) than less skilled players (Abernethy, 1990; Abernethy & \nRussell, 1987; Williams et al., 2002). Participants are usually presented with video clips \nshowing the execution of strokes performed by an opponent. The clip is then stopped at \nparticular time points during the unfolding action and participants are invited to indicate the \noutcome of the action, such as the stroke direction and\/or depth, or the ball or shuttlecock\u2019s \nfuture landing position. To investigate the importance of certain time windows and\/or body \nparts for anticipation, researchers have used temporal and\/or spatial occlusion paradigms as \nwell as eye movement registration techniques (for reviews, see Williams & Ericsson, 2005; \nWilliams et al., 1999).  \nAbernethy and Russell (1987) examined the anticipation accuracy of novice and \nexpert players who were presented with a series of video clips of badminton strokes that were \nedited such that increasing portions of the event were visible or that different body parts of \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 4\nthe opponent were occluded. In trials in which clips of the full shot were shown, participants\u2019 \neye movements were recorded. The experts were able to use information arising earlier in the \naction than novices and anticipation performance deteriorated when the arm or arm and \nracket were occluded. Since the visual search strategies of both skill groups did not differ, the \nauthors concluded that perceptual skill is based on the ability to make full use of the available \ninformation. These results have been corroborated by other researchers, confirming that \nexperts are able to pick up and use information arising earlier in an action sequence than \nnovices (cf. Abernethy, 1990; Abernethy, Gill, Parks, & Packer, 2001; Ward, Williams, & \nBennett, 2002). Moreover, unlike novices who rely primarily on arm and racket movement, \nexperts pick up more information from proximal body regions such as the hips and shoulders \n(cf. Ward et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2002). \n Although researchers have revealed \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018where\u2019 information can be picked up \nto facilitate anticipation, the methods employed for this purpose were ill-suited to uncover \n\u2019what\u2019 information performers may use. Anticipation is only possible if one or more invariant \nfeatures exist that differentiate between competing actions, be they squash strokes or passing \nshots in tennis. Previously, researchers have suggested that dynamic features, rather than \nanatomical or physical ones, form the informational basis underlying the perception of \nbiological motion (Runeson & Frykholm, 1983; Troje, 2002; Westhoff & Troje, 2007). The \ndetailed investigation of (dis)similarities in the dynamics of different actions such as squash \nor tennis shots varying in depth and direction is therefore a prerequisite for coming to terms \nwith the perceptual basis of visual anticipation skills, an endeavor that, to the best of our \nknowledge, has not been pursued to date (but see Troje, 2002, and Haken, 2000, 2004, for \nsimilar approaches to event recognition, and pattern recognition, respectively). In the present \nresearch we identify the dynamic structures underlying the execution of distinct tennis shots \nusing the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion, also referred to as principal component analysis \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 5\n(PCA). In this context it should be noted that, while the term \u2018dynamics\u2019 is used in classical \nmechanics in reference to the causal relation between forces and the resulting motion, i.e., as \nsynonym for \u2018kinetics\u2019, we use it to refer more broadly to all time-evolving phenomena, \nincluding time-dependent motion structures (cf. Newell, Liu & Mayer-Kress, 2001; Strogatz, \n1994). After having identified the dynamic structures of interest, we examine the significance \nof these structures for visual anticipation skill in two experiments. Before introducing our \nspecific expectations with regards to the outcome of these experiments, we briefly discuss \nprevious insights into the information used for biological motion perception and anticipation \nas well as recent methodological advances in uncovering this information. \n \nThe Perception of Biological Motion \n Swedish researchers (see Johansson, 1973, 1976; Runeson, 1977\/1983, Runeson & \nFrykholm, 1981, 1983) undertook the initial attempts at pinpointing the information used in \nbiological motion perception. In a series of experiments, na\u00efve observers were shown humans \nperforming actions in point-light display (PLD) format. Points of lights were presented \ncorresponding to the location of anatomical landmarks on the body (e.g., shoulders, elbows, \nand hips) against a homogenous dark background. When viewing moving point-light images, \nobservers were able to recognize actions like walking (Johansson, 1973, 1976) or lifting a \nweight (Runeson & Frykholm, 1981, 1983), as well as an actor\u2019s gender and the intention to \nobscure the weight of a lifted object (Runeson & Frykholm, 1983).  \n PLD\u2019s have subsequently been used to examine anticipation in sport. Ward and \ncolleagues (2002) studied the ability of experienced and less experienced tennis players to \nanticipate an opponent\u2019s intentions from normal film as well as PLDs. The experienced \nplayers anticipated quicker and more accurately than the less experienced players. Although \nperformance deteriorated when participants viewed PLD\u2019s relative to film, both groups still \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 6\nperformed above chance level and the experienced participants maintained their superiority \nover less experienced counterparts (see also Abernethy et al., 2001). In a similar vein, Shim, \nCarlton, Chow, and Chae (2005) examined anticipation accuracy as a function of skill and \ndisplay type, using a live model, filmed images, and PLDs. They reported that response \naccuracy was above chance levels in all display conditions. However, a significant interaction \nbetween skill and display type indicated that the experts\u2019 response accuracy decreased when \nviewing a PLD compared to film and \u2018live model\u2019 presentation modes, whereas, surprisingly, \nthe reverse picture was observed in the novice group who improved (moderately) when \nmoving from \u2018live model\u2019 to film and then PLDs, respectively. In fact, the skill difference \nwas no longer significant under the later condition. The authors suggested that the skilled \nplayers, in contrast to the novices, were able to extract contextual information, or \u201csubtle \nvisual clues\u201d, from the \u2018live model\u2019 and film-based displays in addition to the relative motion \npresented in the PLDs, and that this surplus information was used in an additive fashion (cf. \nBruno & Cutting, 1988).  \n While the findings from these studies suggest that the temporal structure inherent in \nthe execution of tennis shots informs observers about the ball\u2019s future landing position before \nit is actually hit, they do not address the question of how information is embodied in the \nmotion patterns. This issue was tackled in the context of gender recognition by Troje (2002), \nwho used PCA to decompose male and female walking patterns into four rhythmical \ncomponents that together captured more than 98% of the variance of the original 45-\ndimensional time-series. These four components were used to classify and synthesize \u2018male\u2019 \nand \u2018female\u2019 walking patterns. Troje invited participants to judge the gender of walkers that \nwere simulated using dynamic information, motion-mediated (structural) information (e.g., \nhip-shoulder ratio) or both, and found that the dynamics of the motion was more informative \nfor gender classification than the motion-mediated structural cues. The combination of \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 7\ndynamic and structural information did not improve performance relative to dynamic \ninformation only. \n In the present paper, we used PCA to examine whole-body movements in three \n(Cartesian) directions of different passing shots in tennis. Our aims were two-fold. First, we \nwanted to identify potential differences in the dynamic structures (coordination patterns) \nunderlying the execution of different passing shots. Second, we wished to verify the \nimportance of these structures for anticipation by manipulating their availability to observers. \nIn the first, preliminary part of this paper, we present the results of the PCA on different \npassing shots in tennis, followed by a discussion culminating in specific predictions regarding \nthe dynamics that could be critical for the anticipation of these shots. In the second part of the \npaper, we present two experiments that were designed and conducted to test the predictions \nderived from the PCA. \nExperiment 1 \n The execution of a specific action varies between individuals as well as within an \nindividual across attempts (cf. Bernstein, 1967; Kelso, 1995; Scholz & Sch\u00f6ner, 1999). It \nseems reasonable to expect that in the execution of tennis shots body areas that supposedly \ncontribute relatively little to passing accuracy will exhibit a larger variability across trials \nthan the end-effector and mechanically linked areas (i.e., the shoulder-arm-racket linkage). \nSimilarly, body areas that move consistently from one shot to the next (for similar directions \nand distances) are more likely to be relevant for anticipation than those that do not. Findings \nfrom eye movement research support this line of reasoning; when attempting to anticipate \ntennis shots novices typically focus on the arm and racket, while experts additionally focus \non the more proximal shoulder and hip areas (Ward et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2002).  \n In this first, preparatory study, we used PCA to identify systematic (dis)similarities in \ncoordination patterns across different passing shots in tennis (in particular, inside out and \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 8\ncross-court shots to short and deep targets, see Figure 1). Similarities across different shots \nare expected to manifest themselves via similar eigenvector coefficients, while structural \ndissimilarities between these shots (e.g., consistent distinct hip-shoulder coordination for \nshots to different directions) can be expected to be revealed in consistent differential \neigenvector coefficients. Uncorrelated dissimilarities across shots (e.g., varying knee-ankle \ncoordination across shots to the same direction) are expected to present themselves as \nvariable eigenvector coefficients, above all in the (higher) modes accounting for only small \nportions of the variance. We used PCA to separate the structural features of passing shots \nfrom the inherent random features (cf. Daffertshofer, Lamoth, Meijer, & Beek, 2005), \nresulting in a characteristic description of the passing shots.  \n We expected the similarities in each combination of inside-out and cross-court shots \nto short and deep targets to be greater than the dissimilarities; the amount of variance \nassociated with executing any passing shot is in all likelihood considerably larger than that \nassociated with shot-specific adjustments. For example, in all these shots the torso rotates to \nsupport the arm and racket swing up to ball contact. Playing the ball to a particular place \nprobably requires relatively small adjustment of this motion. Therefore, we did not expect to \nfind shot-specific modes, but rather that a few modes would effectively describe all shots. We \nexpected that consistent differential contributions from the time-series to the modes \n(represented in the eigenvector coefficients) would differentiate shot types. Moreover, we \nexpected to find consistent differences between shot types predominantly in the racket, right \narm, shoulder, and hip linkage. Finally, we expected fewer dynamic differences in shot \ndistance than in shot direction, because variations in shot distance may well be achieved by \nmeans of a scaling of the dynamics. \nMethod \nParticipants \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 9\n Six tennis players (two male, four female) between 15 and 18 years of age (M = 18.0, \nSD = 1.1) participated. All were right-handed, played competitively at a national level (mean \nnational rating = 4.75, SD = 1.40 [1.1 and 10.2 are the highest and lowest rating within the \nLawn Tennis Association (LTA) rating system in the U.K, respectively]), and had played on \naverage 158.3 (SD = 43.2) tournament matches in the last year. Participants gave their \ninformed consent prior to taking part in all three experiments and each one was conducted in \naccordance with the ethical guidelines of the lead institution. \n-------------------------------------- \nPlease insert Figure 1 about here \n--------------------------------------- \nApparatus  \n Four different targets were constructed in the laboratory (see Figure 1) in order to \nsimulate passing shots directed to the right and left side of a tennis court (respectively called \n\u2018inside-out\u2019 (IO) and \u2018cross-court\u2019 shots (CC) in tennis terminology). The lower and upper \nparts of these targets were to simulate short (S) and deep (D) shots (i.e., near and far areas of \na tennis court, respectively). The targets, which were 0.40 m \u00d7 1.00 m (height \u00d7 width) large, \nwere placed such that the midpoints of the lower (higher) pair were 1.20 m (1.60 m) above \nground level, 2.50 m apart from each other. This set-up resulted in an accurate representation \nof a tennis court. While, in principle, shots directed to the deep (short) target may in reality \nresulted in a short (deep) shot, observation of the participants\u2019 performance as well as their \nself-reported performance evaluations suggested that this was not the case. The participants\u2019 \nstart position was a distance of 6 m from the targets, at the midpoint of, and perpendicular to, \nthe mid-line between the targets. In order to standardize ball trajectories prior to the shot, the \nball was projected towards the participant using a runway, located between the targets at a \nvertical distance of 2.50 m above the floor. \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 10\nWhole body three-dimensional displacement data were recorded at 240 Hz (spatial \naccuracy \u2264 1 mm) by means of an infrared motion capture system (Qualisys, Sweden), which \nconsisted of six cameras positioned at 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 270\u00b0, and 335\u00b0, respectively, to \nthe transverse plane of the player\u2019s start position. Spherical retroflective markers (width 15 \nmm) were placed on the left and right shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, ankle, and toe, as \nwell as on the top, bottom, left, and right side of the racket face, the ball, and two reference \npoints situated on the floor in line with the start position 3.5 m apart. The displacement data \nof the markers that were attached to the body (14) and racket (4) were used for further \nanalysis (see also Figure 4-6). In addition, a Panasonic S-VHS video recorder (model NV-\nMS5, Panasonic U.K. Ltd, United Kingdom) was placed about 3 m behind the start position \nand faced forwards so as to record the targets. \nProcedure  \n Prior to the experimental trials, each participant practiced several shots to familiarize \nher\/himself with the task environment. Each participant performed 10 forehand strokes to \neach of the four targets. At the start of a trial, the participant placed her\/himself at the start \nposition. Next, the experimenter indicated verbally the target to be aimed at (IOS, IOD, CCS, \nor CCD), after which the ball was projected towards the participant and struck using a \nconventional tennis racket after it had bounced once on the floor.  \nData Analysis  \n For each participant and condition the four trials were selected in which the target was \nhit at a distance closest to its extreme corner (i.e., the upper left [right] corner for a deep \ncross-court [inside-out] shot and the lower left [right] corner for a short cross-court [inside-\nout] shot). The number of trials we could analyze was limited to four due to the available \ncomputational capabilities; the inclusion of a fifth trial resulted in a state vector that was too \nlarge to allow for computing its covariance matrix. For each trial, the start and end-point were \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 11\ndefined as the initiation of right wrist backward movement (in the y-direction) and the \nmoment of racket-ball contact, respectively. Each trial\u2019s duration (Tt) was determined, and \neach time-series\u2019 standard deviation (TSSD) computed. The latter provided an indication of the \nscaling of the trajectory (and its higher derivates) of the time-series in question. Since we \nwere interested in the scaling features of shots in situ, we did not \u2018normalize\u2019 these standard \ndeviations with respect to shot depth. \n We examined the tennis shot executions in terms of the Karhunen\/Lo\u00e8ve expansion, \nalso referred to as PCA, which is an unbiased statistical method to identify low-dimensional \ncomponents in high-dimensional motion patterns (cf. Daffertshofer et al., 2005; Haken, \n1996). In particular, unlike the standard statistical application of PCA based on the \ncovariance matrix of scalar values which contains no information about events as they unfold \nin time, we used PCA to compute the covariance matrix across time-series, such that a time \nevolution is associated with each eigenvector (mode). In brief, the general aim of PCA is to \neffectively approximate an N-dimensional dataset with fewer dimensions M. To do so for an \narbitrary set of time-series q(t) := [q1(t), q2(t), q3(t),\u2026 qN(t)]T \u22c5 ek (where ek represents the kth \nbasis-vector for k = 1...N; t = t0\u2026T) one chooses a different set of vectors {vk} to obtain \n( ) ( )\n1\nM N\nk\nk\nk\nt t\u03be<\n=\n\u2248 \u2211q v .    (1) \nThe appropriate choice of the vectors vk is found by minimizing the least square error \n( ) ( )\n2\n10\n1\n: min\nT M N\nM k\nk\nE t t dt\nT\n\u03be<\n=\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n= \u2212 =\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\u2211\u222b\nkq v .  (2) \nThe vectors vk are assumed to be orthogonal, that is, independent. Algebraically, this \nprocedure is realized by diagonalization of the data\u2019s covariance matrix. The eigenvalues \u03bbk \nof the covariance matrix (after being rescaled such that their sum equals one) reflect the \namount of variance covered by the corresponding eigenvector vk. The N coefficients of each \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 12\ncorresponding eigenvector vk = v ki (i = 1\u2026N) reflect the degree to which each of the time-\nseries i contributed to vk, in other words, the degree to which they share a specific time \nevolution. The eigenvectors, or principal components vk are often referred to as modes (cf. \nHaken, 2000), which we will do here also. Finally, the time evolutions \u03bek(t) (generally \nreferred to as projections) of each mode vk can be obtained by the scalar product  \n\u03bek(t) = vk \u22c5  q(t).     (3) \nIn order to examine whether shots to different directions can be distinguished on the \nbasis of shot specific modes, the time-series of each trial for each participant and condition \nwere re-sampled to the mean length of all time-series, mean subtracted, normalized to unit \nvariance, and combined into an N-dimensional state vector q(t) (N = 4 [trials] \u00d7 54 [time-\nseries] = 216; t = tstart \u2026 tball contact). Each mode\u2019s projection \u03bek(t) was established (see \nequation 3), and for modes 1, 2, and 3 the covariance (normalized to the interval [-1,1]) \nbetween corresponding projections was computed. To anticipate, this analysis indicated that \nshots to different directions were not differentiated by shot specific modes (see below PCA: \nShot Comparisons across Participants). Therefore, a new N-dimensional state vector q(t) was \nconstructed, this time including all mean subtracted and normalized time-series from all \nparticipants (N = 6 [participants] \u00d7 4 [conditions] \u00d7 4 [trials] \u00d7 54 [time-series] = 5184; t = \ntstart \u2026 tball contact), which was also subjected to PCA, and the projections \u03bek(t) were computed \nnext. Recall, each eigenvector kiv (i = 1\u2026N) contains N eigenvector coefficients i \ncorresponding to different marker locations in the x-, y-, and z-direction from short and deep \ninside-out and cross-court shots. These coefficients were analyzed for modes k = 1\u20265 in \nterms of marker location, (Cartesian) direction, shot direction, and shot distance. \n The trial duration (Tt), time-series\u2019 standard deviation (TSSD), and the eigenvector \ncoefficients kiv corresponding to the marker locations in the x-, y-, and z-direction of the first \nfive modes were subjected to a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with shot direction \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 13\n(2) and shot distance (2) as within-participant factors. We refrained from subjecting the time-\nseries\u2019 standard deviation to a four-way analysis of variance with movement direction and \nmarker location as we were interested in potential effects of shot direction and shot distance. \nWhenever the sphericity assumption was violated, the degrees of freedom were adjusted \nusing the Huynh-Feldt correction and reported accordingly. Effect sizes were calculated as \npartial eta squared values (\u03b7p2). \nResults \nTrial Duration \n No significant effects were found for trial duration; mean and standard deviation \nacross trails were 1.46\u00b10.12 s.  \nTime-series\u2019 Standard Deviation (TSSD) \n There was a significant main effect for shot distance (F(1, 5) = 6.75, p < .05, \u03b7p2 = \n.57); the TSSD of the deep shots exceeded that of the short shots (mean\u00b1SD 4.94\u00b14.22 mm, \nand 4.87\u00b14.22 mm, for deep and short shots, respectively). In addition, there was a significant \neffect for shot direction (F(1, 5) = 47.98, p < .01, \u03b7p2 = .90); the TSSD was larger for the cross-\ncourt shots than for the inside-out shots (mean\u00b1SD 5.02\u00b14.38 mm versus 4.79\u00b14.05 mm). \nPCA: Shot Comparisons across Participants \n The PCA conducted on the four trials for each condition per participant revealed that \nthe first three modes captured roughly 90% of all the variance in each 216-dimensional data \nset. The corresponding eigenvalue spectra were very similar (see Figure 2). \n-------------------------------------- \nPlease insert Figure 2 about here \n--------------------------------------- \n For each shot condition, the covariance between the projections \u03bek(t) corresponding to \neach participant for the first three modes hinted at a high degree of similarity among \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 14\nparticipants for each condition. The covariance between the projections was sometimes \nnegative in some participants. In these cases, the sign of most corresponding eigenvector \ncoefficients differed, indicating that the trajectories of the majority of the corresponding time-\nseries were very similar. We therefore report the absolute value of the covariance. The mean \n(absolute value) of the covariance across participants was close to one, while the standard \ndeviations were low (see Table 1). Furthermore, the degree of similarity of the projections of \nthe different conditions was similarly high; the mean (absolute value) of the covariance \nacross participants between the projections of the different shots (i.e., IOS, IOD, CCS, and \nCCD) was close to one, while the corresponding standard deviations were close to zero (see \nTable 2). These results indicated a high degree of similarity between the shots at the level of \nthe most prominent modes. Potential differences between shot conditions should therefore \nreside in a differential contribution from the anatomical landmarks and\/or racket. \nConsequently, instead of analyzing the corresponding eigenvectors, we conducted a separate \nPCA in which the time-series of all conditions and participants were included.  \n-------------------------------------- \nPlease insert Table 1 & 2 about here \n--------------------------------------- \nPCA: All Trials \u2013 General Observations \n PCA showed that the entire data set could effectively be described by a few modes; \nthe cumulative sum of the first five eigenvalues \u03bbk represented 52.6%, 77.6%, 89.3%, 93.6%, \nand 96.2% of all the variance in the data set, respectively. The corresponding projections (i.e., \ntime evolutions, \u03bek(t); see equation 3) are shown in Figure 3.  \n-------------------------------------- \nPlease insert Figure 3 about here \n--------------------------------------- \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 15\n To determine the contribution to specific modes from the various marker locations, \nwe calculated the mean absolute value of the eigenvector coefficients v ki for k = 1\u20265 (see \nequation 1) across participants and conditions. Similarly, to address the variability of these \ncontributions, we calculated the standard deviation of the signed value of the eigenvector \ncoefficients. The results of these analyses are depicted in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The  \ndifferences in magnitude of the eigenvector coefficients were small in the 1st mode (at least \nfor the x- and y-direction) and became more pronounced in higher modes. In particular, \nanatomically localized and (Cartesian) direction-specific contributions were found in the \ndominant modes, although less so in the first. In addition, while the contribution of the \nshoulder-arm-racket linkage was substantial for the first three modes, this contribution was \nmarkedly smaller for the 4th and 5th mode. In general, the mean magnitude of the eigenvector \ncoefficients across marker locations decreased monotonically from modes 1 to 5 while their \naveraged standard deviation increased. In other words, the variance (from different marker \nlocations) within modes was distributed less homogeneously the higher the mode. \n-------------------------------------- \nPlease insert Figure 4 & 5 about here \n--------------------------------------- \nPCA: All Trials \u2013 Comparison between Shots \n In view of the large number of statistical analyses undertaken (18 Marker Locations \u00d7 \n3 Movement Directions \u00d7 5 Modes = 216 ANOVA\u2019s), we abstained from reporting all the F-, \np- and \u03b7p2-values in the text; these are reported in Appendix A1-A5. Marker locations for \nwhich a significant effect for shot direction was found are indicated for modes 1 to 5 in \nFigure 6, which only represents variations in shot direction as few significant differences in \nshot distance were observed. More specifically, significant differences in shot direction \nversus distance were found in 13 vs. 0, 11 vs. 3, 10 vs. 1, 4 vs. 3, and 12 vs. 2 analyses, for \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 16\nmodes 1 up to 5, respectively. Below, we only discuss significant differences in shot \ndirection. \n-------------------------------------- \nPlease insert Figure 6 about here \n--------------------------------------- \nAs can be seen in Figure 6, characteristic differences between shot directions (in terms of \ndynamic structures and Cartesian directions) across participants were repeatedly found in \nterms of differential eigenvector coefficients. The observed differences were predominantly, \nbut not exclusively, present in the x-direction (i.e., the medio-lateral direction). Although \nthese differences were predominantly found in the right side of the body, specifically in the \nshoulder-racket linkage, across (the first five) modes and directions, significant differences in \neigenvector coefficients occurred all over the body (and racket).  \nDiscussion \n We examined different types of tennis shots in terms of their dynamic modes using \nPCA, as well as their scaling properties (as quantified by the standard deviations of the time-\nseries). We found that five principal modes captured more than 96% of the variance in the \ndata, which was distributed unevenly across the body and racket. Furthermore, the variability \nof corresponding eigenvector coefficients was unevenly distributed across the different body \nareas (including the racket) and was larger for the higher modes. These results indicate that \ntennis shots can be given a compact description, and suggest that their execution might be \ngoverned by a low-dimensional control structure. Although this finding as such is not new \n(see Huys, Daffertshofer, & Beek, 2004; Post, Daffertshofer, & Beek, 2000), it has, as far as \nwe know, never been reported for a whole-body, complex discrete task. \n As expected, neither shot direction or shot depth was characterized by a unique \nstructure. However, clear shot-direction, and to a much lesser extent, shot-distance, \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 17\ndifferences were evident in the eigenvector coefficients of the various modes. Such \ndifferences occurred across modes all over the body (including the racket), although they \nwere most pronounced in the x-direction, particularly at the right side of the body and the \nracket (for a representation of differences in shot direction across the first three modes, see \nFigure 8) The latter observation is consistent with previous research suggesting that racket, \nracket-holding-arm, shoulders and hips are important for anticipation, albeit in a skill-\ndependent fashion (see Ward et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2002). The present results indicate \nthat the information contained in those regions is largely confined to the x-direction. In \naddition, we found shot-direction specific differences in the hips and shoulders in all \ndirections, and in anatomical locations that were not identified as potentially informative \nregions in previous studies, such as the left arm and right leg (in the y- and z-direction). The \nscaling of shot dynamics, quantified by the time-series\u2019 standard deviations, distinguished the \ninside-out shots from the cross-court shots as well as the short from the deep shots. That is, \ndifferences in shot direction were found in the shot dynamics as well as its scaling. In \ncontrast, differences in shot depth were rarely apparent in the shot dynamics as such, but its \nscaling was larger in the deep shots than in the short shots. Shot depth, at least in the present \ncontext, appears to be controlled primarily by a scaling of the dynamics and less so by \ncoordinative dynamic adjustments in shot execution. It should be noted, however, that the \ndifferential effect onto the dynamics of shot direction and distance may be due to differences \nin their respective target discrimination, even though the scaling results contradict this \nsuggestion. Following our premise that anticipation is based on dynamic information, these \nresults suggest that the direction of tennis passing shots is easier to anticipate than their depth. \n In sum, a similar low-dimensional dynamic structure captures the execution of tennis \npassing shots to distinct directions and of different depth. Differences between shots arose \nlocally (i.e., they were found in varying contributions of different body and racket locations \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 18\nto these dynamics), but mainly so for shot direction. In contrast, the scaling of the dynamics \nwas distinct for both shot directions and distances.  \nExperiment 2 \n  In Experiment 1, we found that a few modes allowed for an economical description \nof forehand tennis shots, and that subtle differences in these modes could distinguish shot \ndirection, but not shot depth. However, any description of a system in fewer dimensions than \nthe original represents by definition an approximation. Therefore, we conducted a second \nexperiment aimed at identifying the minimal dimensionality of forehand tennis shots \nallowing for undisrupted anticipation of shot direction (i.e., with an accuracy level similar to \nthat of \u2018real\u2019 shots). In other words, we sought to find the most efficient representation of the \nshots from a perceptual perspective. Moreover, we wished to examine whether anticipation \nskill interacted with the perceptually most efficient representation of the shots. To achieve \nthis aim, we simulated tennis shots that were constructed from the original data as well as \nshots that were constructed by cumulatively including five principal modes. Subsequently, \nskilled and less skilled tennis players were requested to observe the simulations and judge \nshot direction. In contrast to other researchers (e.g., Ward et al. 2002; Williams et al., 2002), \nwe examined anticipation performance only in terms of accuracy because we wanted \nparticipants to look at the entire simulation rather than allowing them to control viewing time, \nthereby eliminating a potential confound. \n We expected anticipation accuracy not to be affected when most of the variance of the \nshots was incorporated in the simulations, that is, when minimally the first three modes \n(accounting for approximately 90% of the variance) were included. Moreover, as the addition \nof more modes hardly changed the shot dynamics (they accounted for only a small amount of \nthe variance) we expected anticipation performance to improve only marginally at best, and \nonly in skilled participants as they are able to pick up and use \u2018subtle cues\u2019 (Shim et al., 2005; \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 19\nWard et al., 2002). Generally, we expected skilled participants to demonstrate superior \nperformance compared to their less skilled counterparts (cf. Shim et al., 2005; Ward et al., \n2002).  \nMethod \nParticipants \n Twelve moderately skilled participants (mean age = 34.0 years, SD = 11.6) who had \nplayed regular tennis at school, albeit at a recreational level, and who had never received \nprofessional tennis coaching and did not play in tennis tournaments, and thirteen skilled \nparticipants (mean age = 26.6 years, SD = 11.1) who all competed at a national level (mean \nLTA rating = 4.78, SD=2.67) and played on average 134 tournament games per annum \nvolunteered to participate.  \nApparatus and Stimulus Production  \n Stick-figure simulations of tennis shots were generated using Matlab (Matlab 6.5, the \nMathworks). The simulations were based on one single inside-out and cross-court shot from \ntwo participants and were saved in Audio Video Interleave (AVI) format. These shots were \nselected because the corresponding eigenvectors of the first three modes most closely \nresembled the shot-specific mean eigenvectors (as determined in Experiment 1) of those \nmodes (in terms of least mean squares). In contrast, using shot deliveries from a single player \nwould run the risk of contaminating anticipation on the \u2018original\u2019 shots by introducing player-\nspecific motion patterns, using multiple players would inevitably result in simulations with \nlarger deviations from the shot-specific mean eigenvector in terms of least mean squares. \nSimulations of shots in both directions were made from \u2018original\u2019 data (MC) and from data \ncontaining modes 1 up to 5 via cumulative addition of these modes, referred to as M1, M1-2, \nM1-3, M1-4 and M1-5, respectively. For the latter five conditions, data q(t) for the simulations \nwere generated by computing the product of the time evolutions as well as the corresponding \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 20\neigenvectors of these modes (i.e., q(t) = \u03bek(t) \u22c5 kiv , for k = 1 to 5, and i = 1\u202654; see also \nequation 1). Thus, for each condition a 54-dimensional vector q(t) was obtained that \nrepresented the dynamics corresponding to the 18 marker locations in 3 Cartesian directions. \nThe data\u2019s \u2018real-world\u2019 coordinates were then obtained by multiplying each (marker\u2019s) time-\nseries qi(t) with its corresponding marker-specific mean standard deviation (averaged across \nshot-directions) and adding its (original) mean. To clarify, the so-obtained stick figures were \nstructurally the same as that of the original shots while the dynamic differences relative to the \noriginal shots were larger the fewer modes were included. This procedure resulted in 12 \nexperimental conditions (6 Modes \u00d7 2 Players). The frame rate for the simulations was 30 \nHz. We re-sampled the corresponding time-series of the selected shots to a multiple of 30, \nwhile minimizing changes in the number of samples. Note that the time-series that were used \nfor the simulations were first normalized to unit variance and subsequently, rescaled \naccording to the corresponding mean standard deviation (across shot directions) so as to \neliminate any possible information in the simulations as regards to shot direction due to \nscaling. The stick figures were presented in black against a white background. \n The clips were imported into Adobe Premier 6.0 (Washington, US) on a notebook \ncomputer (Sony, Tokyo, Japan) with a 15-inch screen. The size of the simulated \u2018players\u2019 \nwas approximately 12 cm \u00d7 14 cm (height \u00d7 width). The trials were edited such that they \nwere preceded by a 1-s presentation of a white background with a centrally placed black dot, \nfollowed by a 1-s presentation of the white background alone. Subsequently, the simulated \nshot was presented, which lasted for approximately 1.5 seconds. After presentation, a white \nbackground was shown for 3 s during which the participants had to indicate verbally whether \nthe presentation shown entailed a shot to their left side (i.e., inside-out) or to their right side \n(i.e., cross-court). The trials were randomized and presented in four blocks of 30 trials. A \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 21\npractice test tape of 20 trials was constructed in a similar manner in which \u2018original\u2019 (MC) \ninside-out and cross-court shots were presented 10 times in a blocked fashion. \nProcedure \n Participants viewed the laptop onto which the trials were presented at a distance of \nabout 0.5 m while seated. The center of the display was approximately at eye height. \nParticipants were told that they would be shown tennis shots where the ball was played either \ninside-out or cross-court. They were told to imagine themselves being located at the center of \na tennis court at the middle of the baseline and that the to-be-anticipated shots were delivered \nfrom the same position on the opponent\u2019s side of the court. They were also told that the shots \nwere delivered by a (headless) stick figure, that the clips lasted up to the moment of ball-\nracket contact, and that no ball would be presented. Participants were notified that each trial \nwas preceded by a white screen onto which a small black dot was projected, which was \nvisible for 1 s, after which the screen would be totally white for 1 s, followed by the \nsimulation. Participants were requested to verbally indicate the direction of each shot (left or \nright) after the simulation had finished. Each simulation was presented 5 times, resulting in a \ntotal of 120 trials. Before the experiment proper, participants were shown 10 examples of \n\u2018original\u2019 shots (MC) to each direction in blocks of 5 shots. The direction of these shots was \nindicated before their presentation. The simulations were presented in blocks of 30 trials, \nfollowed by a short break. The entire experiment lasted about 20 minutes. \nData Analysis \n We determined the number of correct answers (c) for each experimental condition. In \norder to minimize the corresponding distribution\u2019s deviation from normality, we \nsubsequently transformed this number using Bartlett\u2019s modified arcsine transformation (i.e., \np\u2032 = ( ) ( ) ( )( )360 \/ 2 arcsin 3\/ 8 \/ 3 \/ 4c npi + + ) with n being the number of trials (Bartlett, \n1937, in Zar, 1996). These scores were analyzed using a mixed design ANOVA with player \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 22\nand mode as within-participant factors and skill as a between-participant factor. We used a \ncontrast analysis to follow up any significant main effect for mode (the only main effect with \nmore than two levels). We report and graph the untransformed means and standard deviations \nthat were calculated from the original data. \n \nResults \n The accuracy of anticipating the original shots was similar to that reported in previous \nstudies (approximately 75% across skill groups; see Ward et al., 2002; Williams et al. 2002), \nwhich validates our stick figure simulations. The anticipation of shots delivered by players 1 \nand 2 did not differ significantly (F(1,24) = 0.002, p = .961, \u03b7p2 < .001). There was, however, \na significant Player \u00d7 Mode interaction (F(5,120) = 8.374, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .259), which \nrevealed that the shot delivery of the \u2018original\u2019 presentation (MC) of player 1 was anticipated \nbetter than that of player 2, while the reverse was the case when the first four modes (M1-4) \nwere included in the simulation. \n As expected, a significant group effect (F(1,24) = 14.272, p < .005, \u03b7p2 = .373) was \nobserved; the skilled players anticipated more accurately than their less skilled counterparts \n(mean\u00b1SD 77.1%\u00b115.6 versus 66.6%\u00b114.2, respectively). There was also a significant effect \nfor mode (F(4.651,111.621) = 31.403, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .567; mean\u00b1SD 76.9%\u00b113.0, \n56.7%\u00b115.9, 61.0%\u00b19.4, 80.2%\u00b113.1, 78.1%\u00b19.1, and 80.6%\u00b114.9, for MC, M1, M1-2, M1-3, \nM1-4, and M1-5, respectively). Contrast analysis indicated that the presentations of shots \ncontaining mode 1 (M1) and mode 1 to 2 (M1-2) were anticipated less accurately than the \npresentations of the original shots (MC). In addition, there was a tendency for the shots \ncontaining modes 1 up to 5 (M1-5) to be anticipated more accurately than the original shots (p \n= .051). The Group \u00d7 Mode interaction just failed to reach significance (F(4.651,111.621) = \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 23\n2.240, p = .060, \u03b7p2 = .085), although only the less skilled tended to perform better when \nthree, four or five modes were included compared to the original shots (see Figure 7).  \n Visual inspection of the data suggested that when presenting only mode 1 (M1) the \nless skilled performed at chance level, in contrast to the skilled players. Therefore, we \nperformed a one-sample t-test for each group\u2013mode combination to examine whether \nperformance was significantly above chance level (i.e., 50% correct). These analyses \nconfirmed our impression that when only mode 1 was presented the less skilled performed at \nchance level; in all other cases, performance was significantly better than chance (\u03b1 = .05). \n-------------------------------------- \nPlease insert Figure 7 about here \n--------------------------------------- \nDiscussion \n We examined the ability of skilled and less skilled tennis players to anticipate \nsimulated shots whose dynamics were either unmodified (i.e., \u2018original\u2019 shots) or were \nconstructed by cumulatively including modes 1 up to 5 as a function of skill. The shots \nperformed by two players from Experiment 1 served as data for the simulations. \n As expected, anticipation was, on average, unaffected by the player factor. The \nsignificant Player \u00d7 Mode interaction, however, indicated that anticipation performance of the \noriginal shot was player dependent, which may be readily explained in terms of \nidiosyncrasies in technique. Also, anticipation of shots delivered by player 1 when including \nthe first four modes was worse than those delivered by player 2. In order to examine this \neffect, we further analyzed the eigenvectors corresponding to the fourth and fifth mode in \nterms of their least squares differences from the mean eigenvector (see also the Method \nsection). It appeared that, for mode 4, the least squares difference of the shot delivered by \nplayer 1 was larger than that of player 2, which may explain the decreased response accuracy \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 24\nin the corresponding condition. In our opinion, this small deviation did not interfere with the \nprimary aim of the experiment, which was to establish the extent to which the information \ncontent of the simulations could be reduced without affecting anticipation performance \nrelative to \u2018original\u2019 shots.  \nAs regards this objective, we found strong evidence that simulating shot deliveries \nbased on the first mode (M1) and first two modes (M1-2) negatively affected anticipation \nperformance, while simulations created by including the first three, four or five modes \n(corresponding to approximately 90% of the variance in the shot deliveries or more) had no \ndetrimental effect on performance. The implications of these results are two-fold. First, the \ninformation for judging shot direction resides in, or is condensed into, a limited number of \northogonal (i.e., independent) structures or modes, and is therefore identifiable. This finding \nindicates that a low dimensional, compact representation of tennis shots is not only optimal \nfrom a mathematical point of view but also most informative in terms of perception. Second, \nthe results of Experiment 1 indicated that across the first three modes significant dynamic \ndifferences between shot directions occurred at almost all body areas (including the racket). \nThat is, information regarding shot direction may, in principle, be gleaned from all parts of \nthe body. Furthermore, anticipation performance tended to be better, albeit only slightly, \nwhen modes 1 to 5 (M1-5) were simulated than when the original shots were presented. This \ntendency suggests that the information contained in the higher modes (as present in the \noriginal shots) may negatively impact anticipation performance relative to the apparent \ninformational optimal representation (i.e., M1-5), at least in the present context, probably \nbecause the additional variance (information) is primarily non-specific to shot direction, \nrepresenting for instance trial-to-trial variability, thus hampering rather than improving \nanticipation performance. Further research is required to examine this issue in more detail. \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 25\n In line with previous research, the skilled players were more accurate in their \nanticipation judgments than their less skilled counterparts (cf. Abernethy, 1990; Shim et al., \n2005; Williams et al., 2002). In addition, we found evidence that the skilled players, unlike \nthe less skilled participants, were able to use the information present in mode 1, and that the \nnovices tended to respond more accurately when modes 3, 4, and 5 (M1-3, M1-4, M1-5) were \npresent compared with the original shots (MC). These findings suggest that experts are able to \npick-up and use dynamic information of a lower dimension than less skilled players and that \nonly the performance of the latter deteriorates when information that is largely non-specific \nto shot direction (as available in the high-dimensional original shots) is present. The skilled \nplayers appear to have learned to perceptually identify the dynamic invariants that indicate \nshot direction to a greater degree than less skilled participants, and as such are less vulnerable \nto random variability across shot executions. Furthermore, the performance of less skilled \nplayers can be optimized by presenting them with low (i.e., three) dimensional dynamic \ninformation, a finding that may have important consequences for training perceptual skill. \nIn sum, information that facilitates the anticipation of shot direction is in large part \ndynamic and resides in a few independent structures. Skilled players are able to identify and \nuse these informational dynamics to a greater extent than less skilled participants. The ability \nto pick up low-dimensional information may render perception reliable and robust. \nExperiment 3 \n In Experiment 2 we examined whether low dimensional dynamic information allows \nfor anticipating shot direction by presenting skilled and less skilled tennis players with \nsimulated shots that we had generated by combining the most important modes identified in \nExperiment 1. We found that only three structures (modes) contained all the information \nnecessary for anticipation at a level similar to that observed for the original shots. \nUnfortunately, the methodology adopted did not allow us to identify exactly which dynamic \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 26\nstructures were used for anticipation. Moreover, increasing the number of structures for the \nsimulations increased the variance accounted for as regards shot representation. In the present \nexperiment, we attempted to pinpoint which dynamic structures allow for anticipation of shot \ndirection as a function of skill level. We generated stimuli in which only one or a \ncombination of structures contained information about shot direction while information in the \nremaining structures was eliminated. As such, the amount of variance of the shot simulations \n(i.e., representations) was kept nearly constant. In addition to a control condition, in which \nthe unmodified mean eigenvectors were used (see the Method section), we generated \nsimulations in which the eigenvectors corresponding to the following modes remained \nunmodified (i.e., contained shot directional differences): modes 1 up to 5 presented \nseparately, the combination of modes 1 and 2, modes 1 and 3, modes 2 and 3, modes 6 and 7 \nand modes 8 up to 20. The latter two conditions were included to examine if the higher \nmodes contained information that can be used at all by observers. We hypothesized that the \nmore variance a mode or combination of modes contained, the more it would allow for \nanticipation performance. Furthermore, although we did not expect any single mode to allow \nfor anticipation at the level observed for the control condition, we expected at least the first \nthree modes individually to allow for anticipation above chance level, at least for the experts: \nafter all, the results of Experiment 1 revealed that these modes contained quite some variance \nand clearly revealed shot direction specific differences in terms of the eigenvectors. We also \nexpected that, regardless of skill level, the combination of modes 1 and 3 would contain \nsufficient information to allow for undistorted anticipation performance, because in \nExperiment 2 the inclusion of modes 1 to 3 allowed for accurate performance while adding \nmode 2 to mode 1 hardly impacted performance.  \n Pilot work indicated that presenting all the conditions to participants was too \nstrenuous: the tested participants complained about fatigue and, more importantly, fading \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 27\nattention and motivation during the test (even though breaks were provided). Therefore, we \ndecided to split the experiment into two parts, A and B. \nParticipants \n Fourteen less skilled participants (mean age = 39.9 years, SD = 11.7), who had played \ntennis recreationally at school, who had never received any professional tennis coaching and \ndid not play in tennis tournaments, and fourteen skilled participants (mean age = 22.1 years, \nSD = 4.5), who had competed at a national level (mean LTA rating = 2.98, SD = 1.65) and \nplayed on average 175 games annually (SD = 43), volunteered to participate in part A. In part \nB, fourteen less skilled participants (mean age = 38.3 years, SD = 10.8), who had played \ntennis recreationally at school level, had never received any professional tennis coaching and \ndid not play in tennis tournaments, and fourteen skilled participants (mean age = 26.8 years, \nSD = 11.4), who competed at a national level (mean LTA rating = 3.40, SD = 2.18) and \nplayed on average 153 games annually (SD = 69), volunteered to participate. \nApparatus and Stimulus Production \n The simulations were generated in a manner similar to Experiment 2. However, in \ncontrast to Experiment 2, the data for the simulations were based on the mean eigenvectors as \ndetermined in Experiment 1 (i.e., for each coefficient v ki  [k = 1\u202654; i = 1\u202654], the mean \nacross participants and trials for each shot direction were computed). Differences in \neigenvector coefficients in shot distance were averaged out for each mode. For the time-series \ncorresponding to the marker locations of each participant, we calculated the mean and \nstandard deviation across shot distance and direction. These means and standard deviations \nwere used to obtain data with \u2018real\u2019 spatial properties and simultaneously eliminate the \npotential impact on anticipation of the shots\u2019 spatial properties (see Experiment 1). For the \nsimulations, means and standard deviations of two participants were selected that had the \nsmallest sum of squares between the across-participant averages of the time-series\u2019 standard \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 28\ndeviations and their own. In all the simulations, 54 modes (capturing more than 99% of the \nentire variance in the data set) were used. For each shot direction, simulations were made of \n\u2018original\u2019 shots, in which the shot differences that were present in the eigenvectors were \npreserved, and shots in which only a single mode or a combination of modes maintained shot \ndifferences (as present in the corresponding eigenvectors) while shot differences in all other \nmodes were averaged out. Specifically, in constructing the data as q(t) = \u03bek(t) \u22c5 v ki , k = 1 to 54, \nand i = 1\u202654 (see equation 1), we used v ki = v ( )kIO i  and v ( )\nk\nXC i\n for the modes in which shot \ndifferences were preserved, while shot differences were averaged out using v ki = (v ( )\nk\nIO i\n+ \nv ( )\nk\nXC i\n)\/2 (for i = 1\u202654) for the other modes (the subscript IO and XC refer to the inside-out \nand cross-court shot, respectively). The same procedure as in Experiment 2 was used to \nobtain data with \u2018real-world\u2019 coordinates and to ensure that the stick figures were structurally \nthe same as that of the original shots. The following (combination of) modes were chosen: \nmode 1 (M1), 2 (M2), 3 (M3), 4 (M4), and 5 (M5), modes 1 and 2 (M1+2), modes 1 and 3 \n(M1+3), modes 2 and 3 (M2+3), modes 6 and 7 (M6+7), and modes 8 up to 20 (M8-20). For the \nlast condition, our motivation for going up to mode 20, instead of a lower or higher mode, \nwas that in this manner the amount of variance accounted for in this condition was almost \nequal to that of the combination of modes 6 and 7 (M6+7). For instance, in condition M3, as \nalways, all 54 modes were used, but only the (shot direction-specific mean of the) \neigenvector coefficients corresponding to mode 3 were used without alteration, while the \neigenvector coefficients of the other modes (i.e., modes 1-2 and modes 4-54) were averaged \nacross shot direction and thus contained no shot differences (and as such no information that \ncould be used for anticipation). The conditions MC, M2, M5, M1+2, M1+3, and M2+3 were used \nin part A, whereas the conditions MC, M1, M3, M4, M6+7, and M8-20 were used in part B.  \n \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 29\nProcedure \n The procedure was the same as in Experiment 2. \nData Analysis \n As in Experiment 2, we determined the percentage of correct answers for each \nexperimental condition and subjected these percentages to Bartlett\u2019s modified arcsine \ntransformation (Bartlett, 1937, in Zar, 1996). These scores were analyzed using a mixed \ndesign ANOVA with player and mode as within-participant factors and skill as a between-\nparticipant factor. We used Bonferroni-corrected pair-wise comparisons to locate the \norigin(s) of a potential significant main effect for mode. We report and graph the \nuntransformed means and standard deviations calculated form the original data. \nResults  \nPart A \n We found a significant effect for player (F(1,26) = 15.652, p = .001, \u03b7p2 = .376), \nwhich indicated that the response accuracy was higher for player 1 than for player 2 \n(mean\u00b1SD 65.8%\u00b115.6 versus 60.0%\u00b116.5, for player 1 and player 2, respectively). \nUnexpectedly, no significant effect of skill was found, even though on average the skilled \nplayers (mean\u00b1SD 64.4%\u00b116.1) responded more accurately than the less skilled players \n(mean\u00b1SD 61.4%\u00b116.4). Importantly, there was a significant effect for mode (F(5,130) = \n6.208, p = .000, \u03b7p2 = .193; mean\u00b1SD 70.2%\u00b119.9, 61.8%\u00b111.2, 57.3%\u00b110.8, 60.2%\u00b113.4, \n63.9%\u00b111.7, and 64.1%\u00b113.0, for MC, M2, M5, M1+2, M1+3, and M2+3, respectively). The pair-\nwise comparisons showed that anticipation accuracy in the control condition (MC) and the \nconditions with modes 1 and 3 (M1+3) as well as with modes 2 and 3 (M2+3) did not differ \nsignificantly, and that a tendency for a lack of differences was present as regards mode 2 \n(M2). The accuracy in these three conditions differed significantly from the other conditions \n(i.e., M5 and M1+2) which, in turn, did not significantly differ from each other. Furthermore, \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 30\nanticipation accuracy in each condition (i.e., MC, M2, M5, M1+2, M1+3, and M2+3) was above \nchance level (at \u03b1 = .05).  \nPart B \n As in part A, there was a main effect for player (F(1,24) = 6.612, p = .017, \u03b7p2 = .216; \nmean\u00b1SD 65.5%\u00b117.5 versus 59.3%\u00b116.3, for player 1 and 2, respectively). The effect for \nskill did not reach significance, although the skilled group (mean\u00b1SD 63.5%\u00b117.2) responded \nmore accurately than less skilled players (mean\u00b1SD 61.4%\u00b117.1). The effect for mode was \nsignificant (F(5,120) = 7.947, p = .000, \u03b7p2 = .249; mean\u00b1SD 73.1%\u00b116.6, 57.9%\u00b110.6, \n63.1%\u00b113.3, 59.0%\u00b110.7, 59.8%\u00b112.5, and 61.3%\u00b113.2, for MC, M1, M3, M4, M6+7, and M8-\n20, respectively). The pair-wise comparisons showed that anticipation in the control condition \n(MC) differed from all other conditions (M1, M3, M4, M6+7, and M8-20), while the latter did not \ndiffer significantly from each other. The anticipation accuracy in each condition (i.e., MC, M1, \nM3, M4, M6+7, and M8-20) was above chance level (at \u03b1 = .05). \n The observation that a combination of higher modes (i.e., modes 6-7, and modes 8-\n20) allowed for response accuracy above chance level came as a surprise. Therefore, we \nfurther analyzed the eigenvectors obtained in Experiment 1 in terms of shot direction and \ndepth. We performed ANOVA\u2019s with shot direction (2) and shot distance (2) as within-\nparticipant factors for modes 6 to 10 for each marker locations (18) and direction (3; see also \nExperiment 1). Although the number of significant observations as regards shot direction \ndecreased with increasing mode, this effect did not disappear. \n In sum, the results of Experiment 3A and B indicated that all (combinations of) modes \ntested allowed for anticipation above chance level. However, anticipation accuracy did not \nsignificantly deteriorate relative to the control condition except for the linear addition of \nmode 1 and 3 (M2+3) and mode 2 and 3 (M2+3). \nDiscussion \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 31\n The aim of the present experiment was to identify the mode(s) facilitating \nanticipation. In both parts (A and B) we found an unexpected significant effect for player. \nRecall that the simulations were based on the mean eigenvectors and projections found in \nExperiment 1 and that means and standard deviations from two players were averaged across \ntrials shot direction and distance. The only differences between the simulations corresponding \nto these players were in terms of the scaling of the dynamics (i.e., the time-series standard \ndeviations). This scaling may have affected the extent to which observers were able to pick \nup and use the dynamic information contained in the displays. This find would be consistent \nwith that of Pollick, Fidopiastis, and Braden\u2019s (2001) who reported that the categorization of \ntennis stroke styles can be improved when the strokes are spatially exaggerated, at least for \nsome styles.  \nUnexpectedly, we found no significant effect of skill. However, it should be realized \nthat in the present experiment, in which shot direction differences were eliminated by \nincluding modes, the amount of shot direction specific variance relative to the entire amount \nof variance was lower than in Experiment 2, in which we displayed modes with shot direction \ndifferences present. This effect may have diminished skill differences and contributed to the \nlack of a significant skill effect. Regardless, we found that no single dynamic structure \ncontained sufficient information to allow for anticipation that was not different from the \ncontrol condition, but that the combination of modes 1 and 3 (M1+3) and modes 2 and 3 \n(M2+3) did. The information content of the combination of modes 1 and 2 (M1+2), however, \nappeared to be insufficient to facilitate effective anticipation. These results suggest that the \ninformational value of the dynamics is not \u2018simply\u2019 a matter of the amount of variance \naccounted for by the dynamics. The linear addition of directional information contained in \nmodes 1 and 3 as well as in modes 2 and 3 structures the high-dimensional motion pattern so \nas to render it sufficiently informational to allow for accurate anticipation.  \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 32\n The response accuracy was significantly above chance level in each condition. \nAlthough we had anticipated this result for the first three modes, we were somewhat \nsurprised to find it for the higher modes. The additional analysis of the eigenvectors, \nhowever, indicated that differences in shot direction were present at least up to the 10th mode. \nNotwithstanding the small amount of variance covered by the higher modes, shot specific \ndifferences in these modes can be picked up and used (at least when only these differences \nare present). It appears that, even though at the cost of accuracy, the visual system is sensitive \nand flexible in picking up the information contained in those modes when constrained in a \nspecific manner. Indications of such perceptual sensitivity and flexibility have been hinted at \nin previous research. For instance, while evidence suggests that in three-ball cascade juggling \nthe zenith of the ball trajectories is the most informative part of the trajectory to sustain \njuggling, other portions of the trajectories are sufficiently informative to enable effective \nperformance (cf. Huys & Beek, 2002; Huys et al., 2004; Van Santvoord & Beek, 1994). Also, \npeople are able to detect small differences in trajectory forms of oscillators, including \nasymmetry and symmetrical peakening or flattening - changes that may be indicative of \nbiological movement (Muchisky & Bingham, 2002). In sum, although each tested mode or \ncombination of modes allowed for anticipation above chance, only the linear combination of \ndirectional information in modes 1 and 3 as well as in modes 2 and 3 allowed for statistically \nundisturbed anticipation.  \n In Experiment 1, we showed that a few modes accounted for most of the variance \nunderlying tennis shot executions, and that the variance, its variability across shots, and the \nshot-direction specific dynamic differences were distributed heterogeneously across the body \nand racket in a mode-specific manner. Experiments 2 and 3 suggested that the information \nunderpinning anticipation of tennis shot direction resides in the first three modes. That is, we \ncan localize and quantify the perceptually relevant dynamic differences between both shot \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 33\ndirections throughout their execution. To that aim, we constructed an inside-out and cross-\ncourt shot based on the first three principal modes by computing the product of the time \nevolutions and the eigenvectors of mode 1 to 3, i.e., q(t) = \u03bek(t) \u22c5 v ki , for k = 1 to 3, and i = \n1\u202654 (see also equation 1). For each marker (18) we calculated the root mean squared \ndifference (RMS) between the inside-out and cross-court shot as a function of time according \nto ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )( )2 2 2io xc io xc io xcRMS t x t x t y t y t z t z t= \u2212 + \u2212 + \u2212  (the subscripts io and \nxc indicate the inside-out and cross-court shot, respectively) and determined its mean in five \nconsecutive time windows, each with a duration of 20% of the (normalized) shot (see Figure \n8 upper panel). Importantly, the so-obtained RMS represents a difference score in terms of \nthe structure of the trajectories, not in terms of \u2018real-world\u2019 coordinates. To further visualize \nthe results (see Figure 8, lower panel), we computed the corresponding \u2018real-world\u2019 \ncoordinates (by multiplying each marker\u2019s time-series qi(t) with its corresponding standard \ndeviation and adding its mean; see also above) and plotted \u2018snapshots\u2019 of the inside-out and \ncross-court shot at the middle of each time window. Two observations are apparent from \nFigure 8 (upper panel). First, at the beginning of the shots differences in the time evolutions \nprevail in the right lower body and the right hip and elbow. While decreasing in the middle \npart of shot execution, the dynamic shot differences start to increase at the right side of the \nbody to then spread across the entire body towards ball contact (at t = T) , although a slight \nright side dominance remains. Second, regardless of the heterogeneous distribution in space \nand time, differences in shot direction are to some degree present across the entire body and \nracket throughout the entire shot. These results are roughly in line with those of previous \nresearch involving the recording of eye movement data; expert observers typically adopt a \nproximal to distal visual scanning path (i.e., from the hips and shoulders to the arm and \nracket, respectively). At the same time, however, it appears that only a limited selection of \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 34\nareas in which shot-direction differences are present are gazed at, assuming that optical \ninformation pick-up can be equated with gaze direction (Williams et al., 1999). \n-------------------------------------- \nPlease insert Figure 8 about here \n--------------------------------------- \nGeneral Discussion \nIn the present paper we examined the dynamic structure of different tennis shots as \nwell as any shot-specific differences. We found that tennis shots could be effectively \napproximated by a few dynamic structures. Following this preliminary analysis, we examined \nwhether the information contained in these structures could be picked up and used to \nanticipate shot direction by skilled and less skilled tennis players in two experiments. We \ndiscovered that a low dimensional (three-dimensional) representation of the shots allowed for \nundisturbed anticipation, and that the information underlying anticipation performance is not \ncontained in a single dynamic structure, but in a linear combination of these three structures. \nIn the following, we discuss the theoretical implications of these results for understanding the \ncontrol of complex motor skills, the perception of biological motion, and anticipation skill. \nWe interpret the findings from the perspective of coordination dynamics, which we therefore \nbriefly address first. \nMacroscopic Structures and Information \n Coordination dynamics has its conceptual and methodological roots in Haken\u2019s \nsynergetics (Haken, 1977, 1996), which is, broadly speaking, concerned with qualitative \nchanges in complex open systems (i.e., with the spontaneous formation and hence \ncharacterization of spatial, temporal, and functional patterns around phase transitions). \nComplex open systems that are far from thermal equilibrium may organize themselves by \nforming coherent, ordered spatial and temporal patterns and\/or structures due to the weakly \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 35\nnonlinear interactions among their numerous modes. Although the occurrence of such \npatterns reflects the emergence of co-variation among modes at the microscopic level, the \nresulting macroscopic patterns may be described by a small number of so-called macroscopic \nstructures or order parameters. In other words, a high-dimensional system may be \nsummarized by a few order parameters that capture the system\u2019s state, implying a huge \nreduction of information. \nIn the study of coordinated human movement it is well established that the relative \nphase between two oscillating limbs represents, or has the characteristics of, an order \nparameter (cf., Haken, Kelso & Bunz, 1985; Kelso, 1981, 1984, 1995). Less well established, \nbut most relevant for our present purposes, is the conjecture that the visual recognition of \ndynamic patterns may proceed through the extraction of macroscopic motion structures like \nthe modes vk distilled by the Karhunen\/Lo\u00e8ve expansion, precisely because those modes \nrepresent the low-dimensional information contained in dynamic patterns (cf. Haken, 1996, \n2000, 2004). In Haken\u2019s own words, \u201cThe modes [\u2026] contain all the information needed for \nthe reconstruction of the pattern. The coefficients with the largest \u03bbj contain most of the \ninformation about the pattern vector q. [\u2026] all the discriminatory information must be carried \nby the coefficients \u03bej\u2026\u201d (Haken, 2000, p.158). In the present context the coefficients \u03bej are \ndynamic, that is, time-varying, \u03bej =\u03bek(t) (see also Haken, 2000; Haken, Kelso, Fuchs, & \nPandya, 1990). Although principal components or modes can not and should not be equated \nwith order parameters, as the latter are intrinsically linked to qualitative changes in pattern \nformation (i.e., to phase transitions), PCA and related techniques provide a convenient tool \nfor identifying and testing the presence of order parameters around phase transitions because, \nin principle, they allow one to capture the information reduction that is inherent to order \nparameters. \nThe Control of Tennis Shots \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 36\n A recurrent theme in motor control research is Bernstein\u2019s so-called degrees of \nfreedom problem (cf. Bernstein, 1967; Turvey, 1990) \u2013 the problem of how the numerous \nelements that are involved in the execution of an action are controlled. A solution to this \nproblem has been sought in terms of synergies, or coordinative structures, which, from the \nperspective of coordination dynamics, are viewed as coherent macroscopic spatio-temporal \npatterns generated under non-equilibrium constraints in open systems (Kugler, Kelso, & \nTurvey, 1980). In the present study, we found that three structures accounted for almost 90% \nof the variance, implying that the dynamic structure underlying passing shots is low \ndimensional. However, there were no indications that different shot types (in terms of \ndistance and direction) were executed in a qualitatively different manner: no single \northogonal (i.e., independent) mode was uniquely associated with a specific shot type.  \n The variability of the eigenvector coefficients was distributed unevenly across \ndifferent body areas and trials, suggesting that certain muscular-skeletal linkages are \ncontrolled to a greater extent, or at least more consistently so, than others. In addition, the \naverage covariance between the projections of the first three modes of a specific shot \ncondition was close to one (see Experiment 1), which hints at a large degree of similarity in \nthe control structure underlying tennis-shot execution across trials within participants. It \nappears that the synergies or coordinative structures governing tennis strokes are low-\ndimensional temporal organizations with a high degree of similarity in their global structure \neven though the degree to which their constituent modes are controlled across performances \nis distributed heterogeneously. \nDynamic Structures Underlying Anticipation \n In Experiments 2 and 3 we examined the extent to which observers are able to pick up \nand use the information contained in the modes identified in Experiment 1. We found that \nseveral dynamic structures are informative. Participants were able to pick up and use those \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 37\nlow-dimensional structures for anticipation, albeit that only the presentation of specific, linear \ncombinations of structures allowed for accurate performance. The high accuracy scores in \nExperiment 2 when presenting three, four or five modes, but not less, indicated that dynamic \ninformation sufficed to attain high performance levels in anticipating shot direction. In \nExperiment 3, we found that the response accuracy based on linear addition of modes 1 and 3 \n(M1+3) as well as modes 2 and 3 (M2+3), but not modes 1 and 2 (M1+2), did not differ \nsignificantly from the control condition (MC). In addition, we found that shot differences in \nthe higher modes allowed for anticipation above chance level, but only if the information in \nthe most important modes was eliminated (compare Experiments 2 and 3). In combination, \nthese results indicated that, although the representations of tennis shots needed to account for \na large portion of the variance (roughly 90%) in order to allow for accurate anticipation, not \nonly the amount of variance accounted for mattered, but also their structure as determined by \nthe specific combination of orthogonal modes.  \n Having identified the dynamic structures underlying the anticipation of shot direction, \nwhat can we say about the corresponding information? Focusing on modes 1 to 3, we found \ncorresponding variance across the entire body, little to moderate trial-to-trial variability \n(relative to that in mode 4 and higher), and consistent shot-direction differences at all \nlocations, even though the distribution of these modes was heterogeneous (see Figures 4, 5, \nand 6, respectively). These observations are reflected in the RMS shot differences \ncorresponding to the linear addition of the first three modes (see Figure 8). Associated with \neach mode is a specifically structured variance (see Figure 3) that is distributed unevenly \nacross the various body areas and racket (represented by the eigenvector coefficients). \nImportantly, in each context-specific action, the structured variance and the eigenvector \ncoefficients\u2019 distribution are two sides of the same coin; they constrain each other such that \nneither can be altered without affecting the other. \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 38\n The perceptual importance of the variance structure has been shown empirically by \nTroje (2002; see also Westhoff & Troje, 2007) and (indirectly by) Johansson (1973). Troje \nused PCA in his study of gait-mediated gender recognition. He showed that the third mode, \nwhich was oscillating at twice the frequency of the first two modes, was more important for \ngait-mediated gender recognition than the second mode, even though the latter was associated \nwith greater variance). In a similar vein, Johansson (1973) found that subtracting or adding a \ncommon motion mode did not affect the observers\u2019 recognition of walking. In our view this \nwas the case because the structures carrying the information for walking were structurally \nunaltered by these manipulations. In the present case, given that all contributing body and \nracket areas share the three perceptually-relevant time evolutions to a varying degree \nindicates that shot-direction specific invariance resides in the spatio-temporal relations that \nare defined via the linear addition of the first three modes across the corresponding areas (see \nFigure 8, upper panel). While dynamic differences are distributed unevenly in space and time, \ntheir omnipresence suggests that attempts to strictly localize the information underlying shot \ndirection anticipation are inherently arbitrary. However, this does not necessarily imply that \nobservers pick up and use the information from all possible locations. \n Overall, the present results, like those of Troje (2002; Westhoff & Troje, 2007), \nsupport the premise that the macroscopic structures that summarize a system\u2019s state are \ninformational. A few structures captured most of the tennis shot execution\u2019s variance. It \nappeared that the shot-direction specific differences inherent in the linear combination of the \nfirst three structures carried the information needed to allow for undisturbed shot-direction \nanticipation. Following Haken (2000), we conjecture that these macroscopic coordinative \nstructures are readily observable from the kinematics and constitute informational quantities \nprecisely because they capture the system\u2019s state. That is, pattern recognition is based on the \nvariable(s) that (phenomenologically) capture(s) coordination patterns.  \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 39\nPerceptual Expertise in Anticipation \n To date, most researchers have relied on spatial\/temporal occlusion methods and eye \nmovement recordings to uncover the mechanisms mediating skill differences in this type of \ntask (cf. Abernethy & Russell, 1987; Ward et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2002). The findings \nfrom this body of work suggest that expertise reveals itself in the ability to pick up and use \ninformation that is generated earlier in the unfolding action (typically generated at body areas \nproximal to the end-effector) as well as in an increased ability to pick up and make full use of \nthe available information. These results have often been (re-)phrased in terms of experts \nbeing able to pick-up \u2018subtle cues\u2019 (cf. Shim et al., 2005; Ward et al., 2002). While the \npresent results extend and refine some previous suggestions, they contradict others. Our work \nstrongly suggests that \u2018subtle cues\u2019 may readily be substituted with low-dimensional dynamic \ninformation. What distinguished the skilled from less skilled players in Experiment 2 was not \nthe ability to pick up the available information, but rather to pick up the relevant low \ndimensional (i.e., invariant) information. In fact, when available, the surplus (i.e., high-\ndimensional) information present in the optical array was not used in an additive fashion (cf. \nBruno & Cutting, 1988). While the present statistical results do not allow any firm \nconclusions, they suggest that additional (high-dimensional) information tended to lead the \nless skilled players astray. By hypothesis, the less skilled players may have not (yet) acquired \nor refined the ability to pick-up the invariance in the complex high-dimensional motion \npatterns that underwrites perceptual expertise in anticipation.  \n In the above regard, it has been suggested in the area of motor control that learning \ninvolves a reduction in the dimensionality of the dynamic structure underlying the execution \nof actions (cf. Haken, 1996; Huys et al., 2004; Mitra, Amazeen, & Turvey, 1998), although it \nshould be emphasized that the implicit assumption that a reduced dimensionality necessarily \nimplies reduced control is open to criticism (cf. Longstaff & Heath, 2003; Newell & \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 40\nVaillancourt, 2001). The present results suggest \u2013 or at least are compatible with the \nunderstanding \u2013 that becoming skilled at perceiving biological motion patterns may involve a \nreduction of information of the kind suggested in synergetics. In fact, previous research on \ntennis shot anticipation suggests that experts visually scan a significantly larger part of the \nopponent\u2019s unfolding action, referred to as a more \u2018holistic\u2019 visual search approach, than non-\nexperts (Ward et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2002). Since shot-direction specific invariance is \ndistributed across the entire body, it might be that the more \u2018holistic\u2019 search serves to pick up \nthe invariance to a fuller extent than non-experts do. In sum, the present results suggest that \nlearning to anticipate, and maybe in a broader sense, to perceive biological motion, involves \ndistinguishing the low-dimensional dynamics (i.e., invariance) in high-dimensional displays. \nConcluding Remarks \n In the present paper we showed that the execution of tennis shots is based on a low-\ndimensional dynamic structure, and that these dynamics inform observers about shot \ndirection. Coordination dynamics constitutes an appealing theoretical framework to account \nfor this finding because it views and treats pattern production and pattern recognition as two \nsides of the same coin. Theoretical interpretations aside, the present results readily instigate a \nvariety of intriguing research questions of both basic and applied significance that could be \nfruitfully addressed within the current methodological framework. For instance, could \nperceptual learning be facilitated through the use of low-dimensional displays or maybe by \ncaricaturing actions through exaggeration of the dynamics? Also, the dynamic structure is \ndefined over whole-body movements, which suggests, but does not dictate, that observers use \n\u2018globally\u2019 rather than \u2018locally\u2019 defined dynamics. The present methodology allows for a \nthorough investigation of the issue of \u2018local\u2019 versus \u2018global\u2019 perception in anticipation (cf. \nHaken, 2004; Watanabe & Kikuchi, 2006). Finally, in the present study we used PCA to \ndecompose the movement data into a smaller set, assuming implicitly a correspondence with \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 41\nthe perceptual system\u2019s functioning at some level. Although this approach worked well, there \nis no a priori reason to assume that pattern recognition should be organized linearly according \nto maximization of variance along orthogonal modes; a variety of other, linear as well as non-\nlinear, reduction methods may obtain a better correspondence. This example only highlights \nthe fact that much work remains to be done using the theoretical and methodological \nframework adopted in this paper to unravel how individuals anticipate and perceive \nbiological motion. \nDynamic information for anticipation \n 42\nReferences \nAbernethy, B.
