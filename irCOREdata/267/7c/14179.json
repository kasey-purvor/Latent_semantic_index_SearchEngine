Likely success factors highlighted the need to: create \u2018time and space\u2019 for innovation, main-\ntain effective communication and consultation at all levels of the organization, emphasize the oper-\national aspects of the strategy, establish a variety of staff development processes and recognize the\nnegotiatory processes involved in understanding the term \u2018web presence\u2019 in local teaching cultures.\nFundamentally, the paper argues that policy makers should acknowledge the correct \u2018cultural\nconfiguration\u2019 of HE institutions when seeking to manage and achieve organizational change. Thus,\nit is not just a question of establishing \u2018success factors\u2019 per se but also whether they are contextualized\nappropriately within a \u2018correct\u2019 characterization of the organizational culture.\nIntroduction\nThe recent CHEP report (Collis & van der Wende, 2002) which examined the\ncurrent and future use of learning technology in HE concluded that: \nChange is slow and not radical but HE institutions which have a clearer view on their\nmission with respect to serving different target groups (such as lifelong learners) with\nlearning technology and on their position in those markets demonstrate higher levels of use\nof learning technology.\n*Education Development Unit, Crescent House, The Crescent, University of Salford, Greater\nManchester M5 4WT, UK.

Lisewski\n          The main challenge arising from these findings is for HE institutions to develop more\nstrategic policies on how learning technology can be used for different target groups\nespecially given that as Timmis (2003, p. 1) argues: \nLearning technology is set to change the prevailing teaching paradigm as well as helping\naddress other national drivers such as widening participation, increased student numbers\nand accessibility.\nThis is not to exclaim that the call for more strategic approaches to learning technol-\nogy implementation is a relatively new phenomenon. For example, the Macfarlane\nReport (1992, p. xi) recommended a more strategic and longer term approach to the\ndevelopment of learning and teaching in an expanding HE system within which there\nshould be a \u2018vigorous programme of research and development in teaching methods\nand educational technology\u2019. In the mid-1990s, Daniel (1996) urged universities to\nadopt learning technology strategies to address the changing conception of the\n\u2018university campus\u2019 and the need to enhance curriculum accessibility, reduce costs\nand increase the flexibility of teaching and learning provision. On similar grounds, the\nDearing Report (1997, section 13.17) emphasized that existing communications and\ninformation technology (CIT) resources could only be used more effectively if \u2018insti-\ntutional managers developed and implemented a coherent and comprehensive CIT\nstrategy.\u2019\nThat said, recent studies of the uptake of new technologies in the HE sector\n(Jenkins et al., 2001; Smith, 2002; Stiles, 2002) have highlighted the lack of institu-\ntional learning technology strategies as a barrier to their more widespread adoption in\nteaching and learning practice. However, even where it has been acknowledged that\nlearning technology is moving to the centre of HE institutional teaching and learning\nstrategies, it is: \nMarginal in terms of the practices and cultural values of most academic departments. A\ncommon theme in the audit of institutions was the presence of \u2018pockets\u2019 of activity and\ninnovation, while senior managers still talked about \u2018the enthusiasts\u2019 as a small but\nprecious minority. (Timmis, 2003, p. 2)\nLearning technology implementation and managing organizational cultural \nchange\nTimmis seems to be suggesting that the gap between policy, strategy and local prac-\ntice needs to be bridged or what Clegg et al. (2003, p. 51) refer to as the \u2018need to keep\ntrack of the messiness on the ground\u2019. Within the learning technology literature, vari-\nous authors have argued that the successful implementation of learning technology\nbased teaching and learning practice will require changes in organizational culture.\nSaunders (1998, p. 175) reports that it is the organizational culture and environment\nrather than the technology that ultimately determines the learning experience as well\nas being the principal influence on the use of the technology. However, implementa-\ntion studies of learning technology within HE settings have tended to display rather\nunsophisticated perspectives on the nature of the organizational culture and how to\n Implementing a learning technology strategy\n \n177\n  achieve effective cultural change. They have usually focused on the need for some\ncombination of having a clear vision, strategic planning, technological infrastructure\ndevelopment and a strong pro-active institutional leadership (Garrison & Anderson,\n2003, p. 112). McCartan and Hare (1996) highlight the dynamic relationship\nbetween institutional culture and strategies for change led by the need for senior\nmanagement support, integrative staff development policies, responsive central\nservices and a mixture of funding arrangements. The Dearing Report (1997: section\n13.57) however, placed less emphasis on financial factors as a possible barrier to\nsuccessful implementation, in favour of the need for well-informed institutional lead-\ners to consider both a \u2018fundamental rethink of institutional priorities\u2019 and \u2018an equally\nessential change of culture\u2019. Littlejohn and Cameron (1999) and McNaught and\nKennedy (1999) focus on the importance of combining policy, culture and support\nalongside strong senior management direction in effecting strategic change involving\nthe integration of new technologies within the academic curriculum.\nBrown (2002) makes the case for \u2018re-engineering the university\u2019 in seeking to intro-\nduce more flexible learning technology based teaching and learning methods. This\nwill involve not only a technical challenge but also a culture change, although he\nacknowledges that this will be harder to achieve especially in the democratic environ-\nment of a university. Collis and Moonen (2002) give little consideration to the nature\nof HE organizational culture per se; instead they focus on what they regard as the four\nkey components of technology based flexible learning: technology, pedagogy, imple-\nmentation and institution. They assert that strategies that require the effective imple-\nmentation of learning technology in educational settings revolve around the 4-E\nModel: environment (institutional context), educational effectiveness (perceived or\nexpected), ease of use and engagement (the person\u2019s response to technology and to\nchange). The individual\u2019s likelihood of making use of learning technology innovation\nwill be a function of these four factors. Hanson (2003, p. 119) in examining the stra-\ntegic implementation of e-learning in Australian universities emphasizes the impor-\ntance of senior management support, top\u2013down budget allocation, the organization\nof central support\u2014technical and pedagogic\u2014and effective links across these and\nwith faculties and schools, staff development opportunities and reward and recogni-\ntion for teaching or involvement in e-learning. She regards the most critical factor as\nbeing the \u2018winning of hearts and minds of lecturers\u2019, who not only have to adapt their\nteaching methods but also change their conceptions of teaching in terms of generating\na culture change.\nThese learning technology implementation studies all identify the need for some\nform of organizational cultural change to occur alongside the existence of \u2018key\u2019\nsuccess parameters in driving this change but they tend to characterize university\norganizations as culturally rather simple and uniform. Theorists on change and the\nambiguity and complexity of organizational culture such as Fullan (1993, 1999,\n2003) and Alvesson (1993, 2002) suggest that organizational change may not be such\na straightforward process. Alvesson (2002, p. 171) in particular warns against the\n\u2018trivialization of managing culture\u2019 by authors who offer \u2018unitary and unique\u2019 views of\norganizational culture that can be \u2018shaped by managerial intentions\u2019.\n 178\n \nB. Lisewski\n            The University of Salford and its Learning Technology Strategy\nHannan and Silver (2000, p. 87) describe the University of Salford as an institution\n\u2018disaggregated into interlocking subcultures\u2019 within which a \u2018number of competing\ncultures wax and wane\u2019. Given an ever changing HE environment, they argue that\nteaching and learning cultural contexts are likely to be best explained by acknowledg-\ning \u2018local\u2019 complexity, conflict and confusion with regard to institutional policy devel-\nopments. The University of Salford Learning and Teaching Strategy (University of\nSalford, 2002a) is embedded within a Strategic Framework which emphasizes the\ninstitution as an \u2018enterprise university\u2019 alongside its two other core activities of teach-\ning and research.\nThe Learning Technologies Strategy (LTS) is viewed as being central to the insti-\ntution\u2019s programme delivery and learner support system. The principal aim with\nregard to integrating learning technologies within the University of Salford curricu-\nlum is to: \nEnhance the quality of, and access to, learning by supporting and developing the curricu-\nlum through the appropriate and effective use of learning technologies. (University of\nSalford, 2002b, p. 2)\nTwo objectives are identified in relation to achieving this aim, that is, to: \nEnable staff to identify where the appropriate and effective use of technology will add the\ngreatest value to the curriculum and to support staff in the application and integration of\nlearning technology;\nMaximize the institution\u2019s commitment to, investment in, and return on, the effective\napplication of learning technologies. (University of Salford, 2002b, pp. 2\u20133)\nDriven by the formulation of these two objectives, the LTS has adopted a staged top\u2013\ndown three year development plan whereby all modules within the University curric-\nulum should establish a \u2018web presence\u2019 using the Blackboard VLE by August 2005.\nPrior to the LTS, Blackboard-based curriculum innovations took the form of organic\nbottom\u2013up developments, championed by enthusiasts and supported by an informal\ncoalition of central support agencies as part of an evaluated \u2018soft money\u2019 e-learning\npilot project initiative. For example, findings from the e-learning pilot project evalu-\nation reported that in some Faculties there were: \nOne or two highly enthusiastic adopters of learning technologies, and that these individu-\nals were the most effective agents of change \u2026 major barriers are \u2018people issues\u2019, including\ncultural traditions, risk aversion, lack of knowledge and user acceptance \u2026 compounded\nby the fact that the teaching staff involved had a wide range of CIT literacy, varying atti-\ntudes to technology and differing levels of prior experience in collaborative projects.\n(Keegan, 2003, p. 6)\nIn making the transition from bottom\u2013up experimentation to a more strategic top\u2013\ndown learning technology approach, the University of Salford LTS is overseen by a\nLearning Technology Steering Group. This reports to the University\u2019s Teaching\nand Learning Development Sub-Committee which is an adjunct of the University\u2019s\nmain Teaching and Learning Committee. The LTS is facilitated by a newly formed\n Implementing a learning technology strategy\n \n179\n           Learning Technologies Centre (LTC) in collaboration with the University\u2019s Educa-\ntion Development and Academic Enterprise Units. The LTC also offers technical\nand pedagogic support for the Blackboard VLE alongside ongoing guidance for\nFaculties and Schools to identify and address learning technology priority areas in\nthe context of their annual academic and business planning requirements. Further-\nmore, the LTS is underpinned by different staff development and learning technol-\nogy support processes comprising of awareness raising, demonstrated \u2018exemplar\u2019\nprojects and Blackboard training alongside a network of Faculty based Learning\nTechnology Teaching Fellows.\nResearch approach and the emerging cultural \u2018narratives\u2019\nIn order to examine why the University of Salford has adopted a Learning Technol-\nogies Strategy and the factors which are likely to lead to its successful implementation,\nseven semi-structured interviews were conducted with people involved in the devel-\nopment and implementation of the University of Salford LTS at different levels of the\norganization. The people interviewed were: three members of the Learning Technol-\nogy Strategy Development Group, the LTC manager, a learning technologist and two\nacademics who use the Blackboard VLE in their educational practice. Each interview\nwas tape recorded and subsequently transcribed and anonymized for the purposes of\ninterpretation and analysis. This approach was underpinned by the phenomenologi-\ncal assumption that the university organization exists as a \u2018narrative\u2019 of individual\nexperiences. Therefore, people\u2019s individual experiences of the organization can be\nstudied in relation to the organization and any findings can help to explain how these\nparticipants experienced this type of organizational culture with regard to the LTS\nimplementation. Interview respondents were asked to distinguish between the exter-\nnal and internal reasons for the adoption of a LTS at the University of Salford and\nwhat factors were likely to lead to the successful implementation of the strategy. As\nthis is an \u2018insider case study\u2019 and to maintain anonymity, respondents have been iden-\ntified by capital letter rather than job title.\nExternal reasons\nTypical responses on the prevailing external conditions driving the adoption of the\nLTS were: \nCompetitors have really taken on board the use of learning technologies \u2026 we are becom-\ning uncompetitive in that what we have to offer isn\u2019t as flexible, isn\u2019t as accessible and there\nis an expectation from the students that that\u2019s what they are going to get \u2026 there is also a\nnotion that the technology is there now and so some of the drivers are the technologies\nthemselves\u2026 (Respondent D)\nThey have got to do it because other people are doing it, its become flavour of the month\n\u2026 but the university needs to and wants to address key developments and student expec-\ntations, for example, doing postgraduate courses \u2026 to be able to access components of\nthat online, for undergraduate students, there is the need for more flexibility in delivery as\n 180\n \nB. Lisewski\n           recent internal Salford research indicated that students were working more and longer\nhours but they were struggling academically\u2026 (Respondent G)\nSmith (2002, p. 1), Stiles (2002, p. 5), Hanson (2003, p. 119), Watson (2003, p.\n106) and recently published e-learning strategy documents from the DfES (2003, p.\n11) and the HEFCE (2003, p. 2) all emphasize the need for HE institutions to:\nrespond to the rising global competitive pressure of additional educational providers,\npromote the accessibility and flexibility of curriculum delivery and cater for the more\nsophisticated technology expectations of an increasingly diverse and growing student\npopulation. With regard to the isomorphic tendency of \u2018everybody else\u2019s doing it\u2019,\nJenkins et al. (2001, p. 9) report that this may have \u2018something to do with critical\nmass, i.e. as more institutions began to use these VLEs, other institutions felt that\nthey needed to invest in this area also.\u2019\nThat said, both Saunders (1998, p. 178) and Boys (2002, p. 2) emphasize that\nintroducing new technologies into HE challenges fundamentally conventional\nacademic roles, practices and organizational assumptions. Concerns were expressed\nin the interviews about how the strategic use of learning technology could impact on\nthe role of academics and their practice: \nWe should abandon our control over the curriculum at our peril, we are still academics\nwho design, define and largely deliver our own curriculum \u2026 we should not allow the tech-\nnology to make that decision for us \u2026 if an unanticipated outcome of introducing learning\ntechnology was that that changed without us having stopped to think about whether or not\nthat was a change that we wanted to happen, then we would be failing in our duties, so we\nshould have that dialogue about what the role of an academic is where technology is part\nof the context\u2026 (Respondent A)\nClegg et al. (2003, p. 47) maintain that a crucial issue for academics in HE is \u2018who\nhas control over curricula and teaching methodology?\u2019 For example, Becher and\nTrowler (2001, p. 12) present evidence from Rhoades (1997) who found that\nacademics had been \u2018professionally marginalized\u2019 in important decisions about\n\u2018whether, and how to, introduce and use\u2019 learning technology. It is alleged that this\nis more likely to occur when top\u2013down managerialist strategies are invoked to main-\nstream learning technology innovations; the inference being that managers are able\nto exert more control over the composition, design and delivery of the HE curricu-\nlum.\nInternal reasons\nThe need to maintain the momentum of the previous bottom\u2013up and localized e-\nlearning pilot project alongside a desire to develop the University of Salford\u2019s identity\nin learning technology innovation formed the centrepieces of the internal driver\nresponses for the adoption of a more centralized and top\u2013down LTS. For example: \nWe managed to bring together a whole host of people throughout the University and to\nco-ordinate them and to try and provide something, some sense of direction and what\nneeded to be achieved, the fact that we now have a learning technology strategy has to be\nas a consequence of what we tried to do\u2026 (Respondent D)\n Implementing a learning technology strategy\n \n181\n       There has been a drive from the bottom\u2013up which has caused pressure and led to\nchanges\u2026 (Respondent G)\nGiven the history, nature and culture of this institution, it would expect of itself that it\nwould have one, it has traditions of being a technologically based university, very voca-\ntional, those would appear to be part of the rationale for having such a strategy, the insti-\ntution might think that its slipping down the table, getting more and more concerned\nabout its place, and its position, about its competitiveness\u2026 (Respondent F)\nWithin the literature, learning technology innovations in HE organizations have been\ncharacterized as being part of a \u2018transformational process\u2019. Jenkins, Browne and\nArmitage (2001, p. 29) suggest that VLE implementation can be tracked as being\n\u2018part of a continuum of development\u2019 ranging from: small scale enthusiasts (individ-\nualized), to localized, to co-ordinated, to transforming, to embedded and finally to\nthe institution wide \u2018innovative\u2019 stage. Such processes are also reflected in the CHEP\nreport (Collis & van der Wende, 2002, p. 8): \nInstitutions are now transferring from a period of rich and mostly bottom\u2013up experimen-\ntation to a phase in which institution-wide use of CIT is being encouraged.\nHowever, adjusting from bottom\u2013up to more strategically placed and centralized top\u2013\ndown approaches is not without its potential pitfalls. Brown (2002, p. 241) reports\nthat although bottom\u2013up approaches may lose out to competing initiatives and prior-\nities within different parts of the university, a top\u2013down management led strategy may\nbe thwarted at middle management level where tough choices have to be made about\nthe allocation of resources in the face of competing priorities at the departmental level\nof the organization.\nLikely success factors\nInterview respondents regarded the need for: creating \u2018time and space\u2019 for innovation,\neffective communication and consultation, more emphasis on the operational aspects\nof the strategy, staff development processes, negotiation as to the meaning of \u2018web\npresence\u2019 in local contexts and recognition by managers of the correct cultural config-\nuration of the university as being the key success factors in the implementation of the\nLTS.\nThe following comments are examples of the need for room to innovate: \nIts going to be difficult for them to do given workloads and the problems with time that\nthey already have, using the VLE isn\u2019t going to solve their problems with time, its not going\nto be a means of reducing student contact\u2026 (Respondent C)\nThere is very little slack, flexibility, within the whole notion of how people develop their\nown programme, the teams that we have to develop, the whole approval systems and the\nwork they are balancing, a lot of it is set in concrete at the beginning of the year, very little\ntime given to development, you know we do not value the fact that in order to put together\nsomething that is really robust and innovative, takes time you know, its not just something\nthat you can do overnight\u2026 (Respondent D)\n 182\n \nB. Lisewski\n        Smith (2002, p. 1), Saunders (1998, p. 176), and Jenkins et al. (2001, p. 23) empha-\nsize the importance of academics being given time to develop familiarity with different\ntechnologies and produce learning materials. Steel and Hudson (2001, p. 109) report\nthat learning technology innovations must be recognised alongside other competing\nagendas and that the \u2018notion of lack of space\u2019 principally in terms of time may not be\nacknowledged by senior management. Indeed as Reynolds and Saunders (1987, p.\n207) illustrate in tracing curriculum planning formulation to changes in curriculum\npractice by using the metaphor of an \u2018implementation staircase\u2019: \u2018making a response\nto policy requirements was only one amongst many other pressing concerns\u2019 and that\n\u2018what teachers thought and did about curriculum policy involved recognizing their\nshifting and precarious scales of priority over time\u2019. Steel and Hudson (2001, p. 109)\nalso highlight the importance of effective communication at all levels of the HE orga-\nnization in undertaking curriculum innovation and development. This is not just\nabout delineating a clear vision but also how to develop and maintain a dialogue\nbetween senior management and teaching staff as to what management think is\nachievable using learning technology and what is actually achievable on the ground\nby academic practitioners. These issues were reflected in the Salford context: \nIt is all very well the strategy saying we will do x amount of things in the first year or what-\never but that\u2019s very much coming from the directors, the managers but its important to\nfind out what the academic staff think is feasible, its hard to know exactly what information\nis feeding down but my perception is that perhaps not a lot is feeding down or feeding both\nways\u2026 (Respondent B)\nA common theme in the responses was the challenge of operationalizing the strategy\nbetween the top\u2013down intentions and day to day academic practice at all levels of the\norganization: \nThe strategy is never going to include everything which may happen but a lot more could\nhave been included which would have made the strategy appear far more robust and in\nreturn would probably have gained greater support and trust from staff if they felt that all\nangles were covered\u2026 (Respondent B)\nI am not convinced that the thinking has been properly done about how to operationalize\nthe strategy and work with the Deans, the Schools and the individuals to do that, the\nmechanics haven\u2019t properly been worked out \u2026 although the teaching fellows will be a\nreally good link but in terms of operational detail there is an awful lot that needs to be done\nalongside the dissemination of that\u2026 (Respondent D)\nThe learning technology literature is awash with arguments that emphasize the\nimportance of staff development when undertaking learning technology implementa-\ntion (McCartan & Hare, 1996; Littlejohn & Cameron, 1999; McNaught & Kennedy,\n2000; Brown, 2002; Hanson, 2003; Timmis, 2003) and this was reflected in the inter-\nview responses: \nPeople have got to feel equipped to do it, you just feel that you don\u2019t have the time to do\nit and you don\u2019t need to use it enough so its that need to do it and being given the time\nand the resources and support to be able to do it and to feel that its of genuine benefit, so\nthe staff development is important\u2026 (Respondent G)\n Implementing a learning technology strategy\n \n183\n      The key challenge here is how various staff development processes are able to engage\nwith, change and improve local academic practice. The danger, however, is that the\nargument for staff development becomes a \u2018catch all\u2019 success factor; a seemingly\nquick fix solution for changing diverse work place practice and culture. Oliver and\nDempster (2003) argue that given the complexity of supporting e-learning, no single\nmodel of staff development may be able to engage all staff. For example, centralized\nmodels of learning technology staff development maybe too separated from diverse\n\u2018local practice\u2019, accredited courses require staff time allowances for immersive partic-\nipation and one to one support requires the provision of resource intensive activity.\nThe importance of \u2018bridging\u2019 organizational level and individual level \ncultural signifiers and practices\nThe University of Salford LTS makes explicit reference to establishing a \u2018web pres-\nence\u2019 via the VLE in terms of pursuing an accessible, flexible and \u2018value added\u2019 curric-\nulum. Interview respondents displayed extreme variation as to what may transpire\nfrom this in terms of academic practice: \nYou can make a strategy which says every individual shall have a web presence and the\nindividual doesn\u2019t have to do anything about it because they just have to supply the infor-\nmation, it might be something very simple\u2026 (Respondent A)\nIt could be anything from just having a bit of detail about the members of staff that are\nteaching on the module, maybe a few useful web links, some very minimal stuff it could be\na few powerpoints, or it could be a significant part of the course supported or delivered\nthrough the VLE, they are leaving it open to anybody\u2019s individual interpretation, which\ngives them more flexibility to the way that it all develops\u2026 (Respondent B)\nFor staff, it\u2019s enormously challenging for them, it\u2019s potentially threatening, frightening,\nproducing anxiety and fear\u2026 (Respondent F)\nThe term \u2018web presence\u2019 is the symbolic cultural mediator between the strategic\ngoals of the LTS and how these are translated into effective learning and teaching\npractice on the ground. On the one hand, it seemingly offers flexibility and room for\ninterpretation within different cultural contexts but on the other may produce fear,\nanxiety and increased pressure on academic staff. Knight and Trowler (2001, p. 43)\ncite Tierney (1989) who advises that university leaders need to \u2018use symbols consis-\ntent with the local culture\u2019 in seeking to change academic practice: \nRather than assume a functional view of symbols and a passive view of individuals, we need\nto reconceptualize culture as an interpretive dynamic whereby the leader\u2019s symbols may or\nmay not be interpreted the way he or she intended. The challenge is to understand how\nthese symbolic forms exist within particular cultural contexts.\nWhen undertaking learning technology strategies, policy makers need to be cogni-\nzant of the different cultural perspectives and loyalties that exist at different levels of\nthe university organization. Alvesson (1993, p. 105) in examining organizational\ncultural practice within what he refers to as the different \u2018social fields\u2019 of the university\nargues that: \n 184\n \nB. Lisewski\n      There is a discrepancy between the organizational level and the individual level which,\nhowever, through its connection with social fields, is collective in character \u2026 at the orga-\nnizational level people\u2019s values and ideals are expressed in a weak form, partly as a matter\nof compromise. Deep values and ideals are more strongly expressed in forms of work, these\nbeing largely connected with specific social fields rather than collective\/organization-\nrelated.\nSimilarly, Trowler and Turner (2002, p. 247) argue that developing a strong work-\ngroup culture may mean \u2018developing distance from, but interactive tension with, the\nwider university context\u2019. Respondents\u2019 comments on the University of Salford\nculture reflected this picture: \nIt is an individualistic culture \u2026 my favourite definition of faculty is a group of people\nunited by a common grievance on car parking \u2026 you can\u2019t understand universities and\nacademics by talking in terms of a collective \u2026 the analysis of culture at the organizational\nlevel would miss the diversity of the various perspectives that exist within and between\ndifferent parts of the university as well as the even richer diversity of actual individuals\u2026\n(Respondent A)\nI don\u2019t think that there is such a thing as a university culture, there are lots of sub-cultures\n\u2026 you perceive things from where you are and from where your immediate reference\ngroup are, it\u2019s a whole rag bag of cultures ranging from out and out rebellion and anarchy,\nthere is no concept of the university \u2026 they are quite complex, not all distinct, some people\nshare things with other sub-cultures but not others\u2026 (Respondent F)\nUniversity strategists faced with the challenges of undertaking cultural change in the\nface of learning technology initiatives need to recognize their organizations as a frag-\nmented \u2018domain of factions\u2019 or \u2018collection of groups\u2019 (Silver, 2003, p. 165) where\n\u2018conflict, uncertainty and the difficulties of response have penetrated the daily lives of\nacademic staff\u2019 and as dynamic \u2018multiple cultural configurations\u2019 (Alvesson 2002, p.\n190) where local practice and its associated meanings and symbols crucially affect\nhow strategic change proposals are understood, received and appropriated within the\nlocal workgroup cultures.\nConclusions\nThe University of Salford has adopted a LTS in response to external forces such as\ngrowing national and global HE online provision, perceived student expectations of\ne-learning availability and the need to provide more accessible and flexible learning\nand teaching opportunities. However, the challenge remains as to how this more stra-\ntegic approach will be received and translated into \u2018local\u2019 academic cultures and prac-\ntice on the \u2018ground\u2019. The University of Salford LTS is a staged top\u2013down strategy\nwhich emphasizes a \u2018web presence\u2019 vision and goal driven processes targeted at\nincreasing curriculum flexibility and accessibility. Such strategies have been charac-\nterized by Trowler, Saunders and Knight (2003, p. 7) as being \u2018technical-rational\u2019 in\nnature where well-designed interventions aim to cause organizational change.\nControl is directed from the top and mediated within seemingly tightly coupled\nsystems. In such circumstances, Knight and Trowler (2001, p.14) state that the orga-\nnization is assumed to act as a: \n Implementing a learning technology strategy\n \n185\n    Co-ordinated unit with a common understanding of objectives, at least in the ideal situa-\ntion. The assumption is that the outcomes of properly managed change processes are\npredictable.\nHowever, Weick (1976, p. 6) describes educational organizations as \u2018loosely coupled\nsystems\u2019 which are amenable to \u2018localized adaptation\u2019 without affecting the whole\norganization. Thus, the \u2018situated character of professional practice\u2019 (Trowler &\nKnight, 2002, p. 153) is likely to determine local responses to centralized top\u2013down\napproaches to the management of change.\nThere may be an inherent contradiction between the University of Salford LTS\nthat is principally technical-rational in design within an organization that is recog-\nnized both externally and internally as one which is \u2018disaggregated\u2019 in terms of its\ncultural form. There is a danger of \u2018organizational schizophrenia\u2019 in such circum-\nstances manifesting itself in a mismatch between organizational goals and achiev-\nable practice on the ground. The achievement of the University of Salford strategy\nwill require a high level of co-operation and mutual understanding between the\ndifferent central support units, and in relation to, locally based priorities and prac-\ntice within the Faculty and School structures of the University. This may produce\na \u2018contested space\u2019 where the \u2018web presence\u2019 cultural symbolism of policy\nconfronts the reality of practice on the ground. Trowler and Knight (2002, p. 158)\nsuggest, that in such circumstances, educational development professionals will\ncontribute most to policy interventions \u2018by working as consultants with depart-\nments\u2019 thereby engaging with specific work group practices\u2019. Furthermore, they\nargue: \nA university hoping to make a fundamental difference to teaching and learning quality by\nrequiring all departments to introduce new learning environments should anticipate that\nthere will be a considerable range of outcomes and recognize that learning quality might\nbetter be improved by encouraging a diversity of innovations.\nIn effect, the challenge for the University of Salford LTS remains one of imple-\nmenting a top\u2013down strategic approach within a university characterized as \u2018disag-\ngregated into interlocking sub-cultures\u2019. (Hannan & Silver, 2000, p. 87) This\nprovides a \u2018site for contestation\u2019 (Webb, 1996, p. 32) where top\u2013down strategy\nmeets bottom\u2013up culture. The CHEP report (Collis & van der Wende 2002) cited\nat the start of this paper argued that increases in learning technology use in HE\nwere slow with little underlying change in pedagogic practice. This is not surpris-\ning as Stigler and Hiebert (1998, p. 6) describe teaching as a \u2018cultural activity\u2019\nwhere such processes evolve over long periods of time \u2018in ways that are consistent\nwith the stable web of beliefs and assumptions that are part of that culture \u2026 and\nthat these beliefs serve to maintain the stability of cultural systems over time\u2019.\nBecause these teaching beliefs are cultural, then Stigler and Hiebert argue that\nthey must be understood \u2018in relation to the cultural beliefs and assumptions that\nsurround them.\u2019 With regard to learning technology implementation aimed at\nenhancing teaching and learning practice then, as Trowler (2003, p. 146) asserts,\nif innovations are to be effective there must be \u2018mutual understanding\u2019 between\n 186\n \nB. Lisewski\n                                       policy makers, implementers and practitioners. Thus, it is not just a question of\nestablishing \u2018success factors\u2019 per se but also whether they are contextualized appro-\npriately within a \u2018correct\u2019 characterization of the examined organizational culture.\nTherefore, it becomes essential for strategists to become fully aware of the \u2018cultural\nconfiguration\u2019 of their organization and the likely response of the practitioners to,\nin this particular case, strategic learning technology innovations. As Kezar and\nEckel (2002, p. 457) are keen to point out, strategic change will only be successful\nif such initiatives are \u2018culturally coherent or aligned with the culture.\u2019\nWe need to have a more disfigured view of the policy implementation process\nwithin a more realistically characterized notion of HE organizational culture. Learn-\ning technologies cannot be unproblematically applied to improve learning and teach-\ning practice. It is not just a question of putting in place the right \u2018success factors\u2019 but\nrather the need to have clear rationales which are effectively communicated through-\nout all levels of the organization in conjunction with strategies which correctly config-\nure the cultural landscape and localized teaching and learning practice of the HE\norganization.\nReferences\nAlvesson, M.
