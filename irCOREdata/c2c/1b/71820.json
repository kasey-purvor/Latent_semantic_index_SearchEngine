Such responses can occur systemically, at distant \nuninfected sites, as well as in the local, challenged leaves. A small number of core \nsignalling mechanisms are important for the responses leading to resistance against a \ngreat many plant pathogens. In particular, many resistance mechanisms are based on \neither a salicylic acid (SA)-dependent pathway (Dempsey et al. 1999) or a jasmonic acid \n(JA) and ethylene-dependent pathway (Pieterse and van Loon 1999). Salicylic acid is \nrequired for systemic acquired resistance (SAR), whilst JA and ethylene are typically \nassociated with induced systemic resistance (ISR) and certain other SA-independent \nresistance responses. Other signalling events commonly observed during plant disease \nresistance responses are ion fluxes, including the movement of protons, anions and \ncalcium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane (PM), changes in protein \nphosphorylation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Hammond-\nKosack and Jones 1996; Jabs 1997; Ebel and Mith\u00f6fer 1998; Blumwald 1998). \n \nAmongst the earliest observed signalling events in plant-pathogen interactions are ion \nfluxes and changes in PM electrical potential (Ebel and Mith\u00f6fer 1998; Blumwald et al. \n1998; Heath 2000). Most commonly, pathogen elicitors cause depolarisation of the PM \nand alkalinisation of the extracellular space. Several mechanisms could cause PM \ndepolarisation, such as inhibition of the proton pumping H+-ATPase, the activation of \nCa2+, K+ or non-selective cation channels or activation of anion efflux channels (Ward \n4 \net al. 1995). Several authors have provided evidence that elicitor-induced PM \ndepolarisation is a direct consequence of inhibition of the H+-ATPase (e.g. \nLadyzhenskaya et al. 1991; Popham et al. 1995; Simon-Plas et al. 1997). The PM H+-\nATPase generates a transmembrane electrochemical gradient via the extrusion of H+ \nions from the cell, using energy from ATP hydrolysis. Physiologically, this \nelectrochemical gradient is utilised by the plant for nutrient uptake, phloem loading, \nstomatal opening and maintenance of cellular pH (Palmgren 2001). Despite these key \nphysiological functions of the H+-ATPase, because it provides a force for ion transport \nand can regulate the activity of voltage-gated ion channels, pathogen-induced changes \nin the PM electrical potential constitute a possible signalling role for the H+-ATPase. \n \nSeveral studies have suggested a direct involvement of the H+-ATPase in plant pathogen \ndefence. Vera-Estrella et al. (1994) investigated defence responses in tomato cells \nactivated by the Cladosporium fulvum race-specific elicitor Avr5. Treatment of \nsuspension culture cells containing the corresponding Cf5 resistance gene caused a \nrapid, four-fold increase in H+-ATPase activity, membrane hyperpolarisation and \nacidification of the extracelluar medium. In contrast to this, however, elicitation of \ntransgenic Cf9 tobacco cells with the C. fulvum Avr9 elicitor results in an extracellular \nalkalinisation, consistent with H+-ATPase inhibition (Piedras et al. 1998). Interestingly, \nover-expression of a bacterial proton pump in transgenic tobacco and potato plants \ncaused an HR-like programmed cell death and increased pathogen resistance (Mittler et \nal. 1995; Abad et al. 1997, Rizhsky and Mittler 2001). More direct links between H+-\nATPase activity and pathogen defence have been made in monocotyledonous plants. A \n2.5-fold increase in H+-ATPase activity and concomitant acidification of the \n5 \nextracellular space was demonstrated in resistant pearl millet seedlings inoculated with \nthe downy mildew Sclerospora graminicola, whilst there was no change in H+-ATPase \nactivity in susceptible varieties (Madhu et al. 2001). H+-ATPase activity levels \ncorrelated strongly with the level of resistance to S. graminicola across a range of \ncultivars. In barley, activation of the H+-ATPase is associated with HR during resistance \nto powdery mildew (Zhou et al. 2000). \n \nBy manipulating the activity of the H+-ATPase in vivo using pharmacological agents, \nseveral groups have provided evidence for a role in the induction of defence responses. \nFor example, treatment of leaves with the phytotoxin fusicoccin (FC), which activates \nthe PM H+-ATPase, caused an increase in HR lesion density in incompatible barley-\npowdery mildew interactions (Zhou et al. 2000). In tomato and tobacco plants, \napplication of FC leads to increased SA biosynthesis and expression  of PR genes, and \nregulates a range of other genes associated with plant defence responses (Roberts and \nBowles 1999; Schaller and Oecking 1999; Schaller et al. 2000; Frick and Schaller \n2002). Interestingly, activation of the H+-ATPase by FC also inhibits accumulation of \nsystemic wound response proteins (SWRPs) and their transcripts (Doherty and Bowles \n1990; Schaller and Oecking 1999). Conversely, H+-ATPase inhibition by vanadate \ncauses SWRP transcript induction. Schaller and Oecking (1999) suggested that the H+-\nATPase may therefore serve as a switch between wound and pathogen defence \nsignalling. \n \nThe signalling mechanisms for FC mediated induction of PR genes and other defence \nresponses remain unknown. The accumulation of SA in FC treated tobacco plants and \n6 \nthe ability of SA to induce PR gene expression suggested one possible causal link. \nHowever, SA is apparently not required for the induction of PR genes by FC in tomato \nor tobacco plants. Schaller et al. (2000), used 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid, an \ninhibitor of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, to prevent FC-induced SA \nbiosynthesis in tomato plants, but observed no affect on PR gene expression following \nthis treatment. Consistent with this observation, FC-induced PR gene expression was \nunaffected in SA-deficient nahG transgenic tobacco plants (Schaller et al. 2000). \nTherefore, in FC treated tomato and tobacco plants, PR gene expression is SA-\nindependent. We were interested to extend this line of investigation, and report here on \nexperiments to determine whether other well-characterised pathogen-induced defence \nsignalling pathways are required for FC-mediated PR gene expression, and whether FC \npromotes resistance to pathogens. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nPlant material and bioassays \nTomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) plants used in these experiments were the wild-\ntype cultivars Moneymaker and RioGrande, the ethylene-insensitive mutant Never-ripe \nin the Pearson background (C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center), the JA-\ndeficient JL5(def1) mutant (Lightner et al. 1993) and transgenic plants containing a \nbacterial salicylate hydroxylase gene, nahG (Brading et al. 2000). All plants were \ngrown in glasshouses or controlled environment growth chambers at 25\u00b0C under a 16 h \nday light regime. Plants were used for experiments at 3-4 weeks old. Unless otherwise \nstated, FC and pharmacological agents were applied through the transpiration stream. \nPlants were excised by cutting the stem with a razor blade, just above soil level, and \n7 \nplaced in water or sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0 (SPB) containing the appropriate \nchemical for 30 minutes, with a 30 minute pre-treatment where necessary. Reagents \nwere applied at the following concentrations: 1 \u00b5M FC, 0.1 or 0.5 M gadolinium \nchloride, 5 mM EGTA and 5 mM DPI. Wounding was performed by crushing the \nleaflets with blunt forceps. After treatments, plants where transferred to water and \nreturned to the growth room. Leaf material was harvested by flash freezing in liquid \nnitrogen 24 hours, or 12 hours (for wounding treatment), later. \nFor experiments at different humidity levels, plants were either incubated in growth \nchambers set at 70% relative humidity (normal growth conditions), or in the same \nchambers but enclosed in sealed plastic boxes lined with water-saturated paper towels to \nproduce a high humidity environment. For the experiment on wilted plants, water was \nwithheld from 3-week old plants for 7 days, until plants exhibited severe wilting. At this \npoint, plants were either harvested for RNA extraction, or cut at the base and subjected \nto FC application through the transpiration stream or placed into water alone. \n  \nRNA northern gel blot  gel blot analysis. \nRNA was extracted from harvested tissue using scaled-up version of the method of \nVerwoerd et al., (1989). RNA was separated on agarose gels before the transfer onto \nMagna nylon membranes (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA). 32P-labelled probes \nwere prepared by random-primed labelling and purified on Sephadex G-50 columns \nbefore overnight hybridisation with filters in 0.25 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 and 7% \n(w\/v) SDS at 65oC. Filters were washed in 0.02 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1% \n(w\/v) SDS at 65oC. Bands were visualised by autoradiography. \n \n8 \nP. syringae inoculation of whole leaflets \nColonies of P. syringae pathovar tomato, strain T1 were cultured overnight in 50 mL of \nKing\u2019s B medium containing 50 \u00b5g\/L rifampicicin at 28oC with shaking at 250 rpm. \nCells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 mins at 1500 x g. The supernatant was \nremoved and the cell pellet resuspended in 25 mL of 10 mM of MgCl2. Cells were \ncentrifuged again and resuspended in 10 mL of 10 mM MgCl2.   Cell density was \nestimated by the optical density at 600 nm and an inoculum prepared containing 2.3 x \n107 cfu\/mL of cells in 0.05% Silwet L-77 in 10 mM MgCl2. Leaves of whole plants \nwere inoculated by dipping them into this bacterial cell suspension for 15-30 seconds. \nExcess inoculum was blotted away using paper towels. Disease symptoms were scored \nover the following six days. Mock inoculations were carried out using 0.05% Silwet L-\n77 in 10 mM MgCl2. Pre-treatments were performed by infiltrating either 10 mM \nMgCl2, 1 \u00b5M FC or 0.1 M INA into the leaf space using a plastic 1 mL syringe. \n \nReproducibility \nAll experiments involved a minimum of 3 plants per treatment and were carried out on \nat least three independent occasions. \n \n \nResults \nPR gene induction by FC is independent of SA, JA and ethylene signalling \nUsing two independent approaches \u2013 transgenic tobacco plants unable to accumulate SA \nand pharmacological inhibition of SA biosynthesis in tomato \u2013 Schaller et al. (2000), \nshowed that SA is not required for the induction of PR genes by FC. Beyond this, \n9 \nnothing is known of the mechanisms by which FC induces PR gene expression. Since \nSA, JA and ethylene are key hormones in pathogen induced defence signalling, we \ninvestigated further the roles of these hormones in FC-mediated PR gene induction in \ntomato. The JA-deficient mutant, JL5, the ethylene-insensitive mutant, Never ripe (NR), \nand a transgenic nahG tomato line that accumulates low levels of SA, were tested along \nwith wild type (WT) tomato plants for their ability to express the PR genes PR3A and \nPR3B in response to FC. PR3A and PR3B mRNA levels were measured by northern gel \nblot analysis 24 hours after treatment. Figure 1 shows that FC caused induction of both \nPR3A and PR3B genes in WT, JL5, NR and nahG plants. In the case of PR3A, \nexpression levels were similar in all lines, whereas for PR3B, expression was higher in \nthe nahG plants than in the other lines. These data suggest that neither JA, ethylene nor \nSA are essential for FC signalling in tomato, and further, that SA negatively regulates \nPR3B gene expression during the FC response.  \n \nPR gene induction by FC does not require the generation of reactive oxygen species \nSince FC-mediated PR gene induction does not appear to operate via typical \u2018late\u2019 \npathogen-induced defence signalling pathways, we decided to investigate \u2018early\u2019 \nsignalling events. ROS are key signals for several defence responses in plants, including \npathogen responses (Low and Merida, 1996; Lamb and Dixon 1997; Wojtaszek 1997). \nThe PM NADPH-dependent oxidase, which generates superoxide, is regarded a major \nsource of ROS production in many systems (Low and Merida, 1996; Lamb and Dixon \n1997; Wojtaszek 1997). Chemical inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, such as \ndiphenylene iodonium (DPI), have been show to significantly reduce defence responses \ninduced by pathogens and wounding (e.g. Alvarez et al. 1998; Orozco-C\u00e1rdenas et al. \n10 \n2001). DPI inhibits generation of other ROS besides superoxide, including H2O2 and \nnitric oxide (Bestwick et al. 1999). We therefore tested the ability of DPI to block FC \nsignalling. FC was able to induce normal levels of expression of PR3A and PR3B \nfollowing DPI pre-treatment (Fig. 2). In contrast, in plants that were wounded after the \nDPI pre-treatment, expression of the wound-inducible proteinase inhibitor II (PIN II) \ngene was significantly reduced compared to controls (Fig. 2), as reported previously \n(Orozco-C\u00e1rdenas et al. 2001). This confirms that DPI was successfully taken up \nthrough the transpiration stream and blocked the production of ROS under our \nexperimental conditions. \n \nFC induction of PR genes in the presence of inhibitors of calcium signalling \nWe next investigated whether calcium is involved in mediating FC-induced PR3A and \nPR3B expression. Ca2+ is an important second messenger involved in many biotic and \nabiotic stress responses (Knight and Knight 2001). Increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ can \nbe reduced using the non-specific calcium channel blocker gadolinium, or by using \nEGTA, an extracellular Ca2+ chelator. We pre-treated plants for 30 minutes with either \n0.1 M or 0.5 M gadolinium chloride, or 5 mM EGTA, before application of FC. Figure \n3 shows that PR3A and PR3B expression levels were very low in control plants treated \nwith inhibitors of calcium signalling or water alone, but that FC was able to induce \nexpression to high levels in the presence of Gd3+ and EGTA. \n \nFC-induced PR gene expression is not regulated by water loss \nOne of the main physiological consequences of FC treatment of plants is wilting, caused \nby H+-ATPase-driven stomatal opening. In our experiments, we often observed wilting \n11 \nof the leaves during FC treatment that was reversed on transfer to water. Some PR \ngenes such as osmotin (Grillo et al., 1995) are up-regulated by osmotic stress. We \ntherefore wanted to discount the possibility that the response we were measuring was a \ngeneral dehydration effect caused by FC. To prevent water loss from plants during FC \ntreatment, we conducted experiments in sealed containers with a water-saturated \natmosphere, and applied FC to the cut stem in our typical transpiration stream \napplication assay, or infiltrated FC directly into the leaf space using a plastic syringe. \nWhen applied through the transpiration stream, FC was ineffective in inducing gene \nexpression at high humidity compared with the response observed under normal growth \nconditions (Fig. 4A). This could mean either that water loss is a pre-requisite for gene \nexpression, or that the high humidity environment prevents uptake of FC. When FC was \ninfiltrated directly into leaves, however, gene expression was induced in plants at both \nnormal and high levels of humidity. Together, these results suggest that high humidity \nprevents transpiration (and uptake of FC) but not PR gene expression in response to \ndirectly applied FC. Hence, in this experiment, FC-induced PR gene expression is \napparently not mediated by dehydration. \n \nTo confirm this suggestion, we also tested whether PR3A was expressed in wilted \nplants and whether FC was able to act as an inductive signal in wilted plants. RNA was \nextracted from untreated, severely wilted WT tomato plants, whilst other wilted plants \nwere subjected to FC application through the transpiration stream or placed into water. \nIn both cases, plants rapidly regained turgor. The results shown in Figure 4B \ndemonstrate that PR3A is not expressed in intact, dehydrated plants, but is induced by \nFC in similarly wilted plants that are taking up water and gaining turgor. \n12 \n \nEffect of FC on a plant-pathogen interaction \nSince FC is able to promote a number of responses typical of disease resistance, \nincluding SA biosynthesis (Schaller et al. 2000), ethylene biosynthesis (Chen and Kao \n1993; Malerba et al. 1995; Malerba and Bianchetti 1996) and defence gene expression, \nwe investigated the ability of FC to increase resistance against the plant pathogenic \nbacterium Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato, the causal agent of bacterial speck \ndisease in tomato. \n \n3-4 week old WT tomato leaves were infiltrated with 1 \u00b5M FC, 10 mM MgCl2 \n(negative control) or 0.1 M INA, a molecule that induces the acquired resistance \nresponse (Vernooij et al. 1995). These plants were then either mock-inoculated or \ninoculated with a virulent, disease-causing strain of P. syringae, and symptoms \nmonitored over the following six days (Figure 5 and Table 1). In mock-inoculated \ncontrol and FC-treated leaves, no symptoms were observed (Fig 5A & B). As expected, \ninoculated INA-treated leaves showed no disease symptoms either (data not shown). In \ncontrol leaves inoculated with P. syringae, mild disease symptoms, visible as leaf \ncollapse and necrosis, occurred on day two. The severity of necrosis then increased over \nthe next four days (Table 1), with characteristic bacterial specks becoming visible after \nfive to six days (Fig. 5C). However, tomato leaves infiltrated with FC and then \ninoculated with P. syringae, exhibited extensive necrosis and leaf collapse within one \nday of treatment. Necrosis increased over the next five days (Table 1) and bacterial \nspeck occurred at greater density than in inoculated control leaves (Fig. 5D). These \nsymptoms were more rapid (Table 1) and severe (compare Fig. 5C & D) than in \n13 \ncontrols. Since virulent strains of  P. syringae can suppress PR gene expression by \nactivation of JA signalling pathways (Zhao et al., 2003), we also performed an \nexperiment in which FC treatment was carried out five days prior to inoculation with \nbacteria, to allow PR protein accumulation and establishment of any resistance before \npathogen challenge. Severe symptoms were also observed in these leaves, similar to \nconcurrent treatments (Fig 5E). \n \nContrary to expectation, FC clearly increases the speed and severity of disease \nsymptoms caused by P. syringae in tomato leaves. We formed two hypotheses to \naccount for this observation. Firstly, FC treatment might increase entry of P. syringae \ninto the leaf, since they infect the plant through the stomata, which would be expected \nto have larger apertures in FC-treated leaves. Secondly, FC stimulates ethylene \nproduction (Chen and Kao 1993; Malerba et al. 1995; Malerba and Bianchetti 1996) and \nethylene promotes necrosis during compatible interactions (Lund et al. 1998; O\u2019Donnell \net al. 2001, 2003). Hence, precocious ethylene production induced by FC might account \nfor the increased necrosis that we observed. To discriminate between these two \npossibilities, we tested the effect of FC on the interaction between P. syringae and the \nethylene insensitive NR tomato mutant. Ethylene does not appear to play a significant \nrole in stomatal behaviour in tomato (Hussain et al. 1999). In plants with no pre-\ntreatment, development of disease symptoms was similar in NR plants to that in WT \nplants (Table 1). However, unlike in WT plants, in FC-treated leaves of NR plants, there \nwas no increase in severity or rate of disease symptom formation (Table 1). Therefore, \nas NR tomato plants are insensitive to ethylene, we conclude that ethylene plays a direct \nrole in the FC-mediated increase in necrosis in P. syringae-infected WT tomato plants.  \n14 \n \n \nDiscussion \nNumerous defence-related genes are expressed following treatment of tomato plants \nwith FC. These include \u201clate\u201d defence response genes, such as the PR protein genes, \nand \u201cearly\u201d defence response genes, such as those encoding ACC oxidase, MAPKs, \nCDPKs, calmodulin and NADPH oxidase (Roberts and Bowles 1999; Frick and \nSchaller 2002). Significantly, the timing of induction of these genes by FC is consistent \nwith their patterns of induction in pathogen-induced defence responses, in that the early \nand late pathogen-induced genes maintain the same early and late transcription patterns \nin the FC response. Since the only recognised target of FC in plants is the PM H+-\nATPase, it is likely that these gene expression patterns are mediated by increased H+-\nATPase activity following FC treatment. In this regard, it is interesting to note that \nincreased  H+-ATPase activity is associated with resistance in several plant-pathogen \ninteractions (Vera-Estrella et al. 1994; Madhu et al. 2001; Zhou et al. 2000). The aims \nof this study were to investigate the mechanism of FC induced PR gene expression and \nto test whether the FC-induced defence responses provide protection against pathogen \ninfection. \n \nWe first tested whether the common defence signalling hormones SA, JA and ethylene \nare required for FC-induced PR gene expression. These hormones are involved in the \nvast majority of characterised resistance responses (Dempsey et al. 1999; Pieterse and \nvan Loon 1999). Expression of the marker genes PR3A and PR3B was not inhibited in \ntransgenic nahG plants unable to accumulate SA, in the JA-deficient mutant JL5, nor in \n15 \nthe ethylene-insensitive mutant, Never ripe. We therefore conclude that the response to \nFC is mediated by an SA, JA and ethylene-independent pathway. In agreement with the \nfindings of Schaller et al. (2000), who found increased PR2B and PR3B gene \nexpression in the presence of the SA biosynthesis inhibitor, AIP, we noted that the \nexpression of PR3B was elevated in the nahG plants compared to the other lines tested. \nThese results indicate a negative affect of SA on FC-induced expression of genes \nencoding basic PR proteins. \n \nWe also investigated the roles of two early defence response signalling components, \nROS and Ca2+. An oxidative burst that generates ROS is a common feature of many \nplant-pathogen interactions, and is linked with the initiation of several defence \nresponses (Low and Merida, 1996; Lamb and Dixon 1997; Wojtaszek 1997). Whilst \nDPI, an inhibitor of the production of various ROS (Bestwick et al. 1999), prevented \nwound-induced PIN II gene expression as predicted, no effect on FC-induced PR gene \nexpression was observed. FC signalling does not therefore require the generation of \nROS of the type commonly associated with plant defence responses. The activation of \nplasma membrane Ca2+ channels is also a common early defence response signalling \nmechanism (Ebel and Mith\u00f6fer 1998; Blumwald et al. 1998). We used both EGTA, an \nextracellular Ca2+ chelator, and Gd3+, which blocks PM Ca2+ channels, to inhibit Ca2+ \nsignalling in tomato. Both these inhibitors have been shown previously to be effectively \ntaken up and transported within intact plants (Chung and Ferl, 1999). Neither treatment \naffected the expression of PR genes in response to FC, eliminating a requirement for \nCa2+ too. Hence we have as yet been unable to identify a recognised defence signalling \npathway through which FC might act. \n16 \n \nSince FC has a major physiological impact on the plant by causing stomatal opening \nand increased water loss by transpiration, we wanted to test whether or not this stress \nresponse might be linked to the expression of PR genes. We conclusively show here that \nwater loss from the leaf is not a causal factor in the induction of defence responses by \nFC. Firstly, FC is able to act in leaves in which transpiration is prevented by \nmanipulating humidity, and second, PR genes are not expressed in severely wilted \nplants, but their transcription can be activated in wilted plants by the application of FC \nduring rehydration.  \n \nDespite the failure to identify a known pathogen response pathway that FC might act \non, several responses to FC (defence gene expression and SA and ethylene biosynthesis) \nare typical pathogen-induced responses. One explanation for our results might be that \nFC acts downstream of SA, JA and\/or ethylene in activating gene transcription and \nother responses. This is unlikely, however, given that the available evidence indicates \nthat FC specifically activates the PM H+-ATPase. This evidence includes the \nobservation that all physiological effects of FC (apart from those described above) can \nbe interpreted in terms of H+-ATPase activation (Marr\u00e8 1979), and the recent solution of \nthe 3-dimensional crystal structure of the complex between FC, the H+-ATPase and the \nactivating 14-3-3 protein (Wurtele et al. 2003). Interestingly, it has recently been found \nthat the elicitor protein NIP1 from the barley pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis, which \nalso activates the PM H+-ATPase, induces necrosis and activates expression of several \nPR genes (Fiegen and Knogge 2003; Steiner-Lange et al. 2003). Targets for FC in \nplants other than the H+-ATPase may yet exist, however. There is recent evidence to \n17 \nshow that FC can dramatically impact on Xenopus embryogenesis via a mechanism \ninvolving 14-3-3 proteins, but in the absence of homologues of plant H+-ATPases \n(Bunney et al. 2003). An alternative explanation is that FC activates an as yet \nuncharacterised defence pathway. Several pathogen resistance mechanisms that are \nindependent of SA, JA and ethylene have been reported previously. For example, in \nArabidopsis, resistance to Phytophthora porri was maintained in plants insensitive to \nethylene, JA and SA (Roetschi et al. 2001), and resistance to Peronospora parasitica \nmediated by the RPP7 resistance gene is also SA, JA and ethylene-independent \n(McDowell et al. 2000). Similarly, resistance to Phytophthora infestans is not affected \nin NR, JL5 or nahG tomato plants (Smart et al. 2003). Perhaps FC might activate a \npathway in tomato similar to that responsible for resistance to P. infestans?  \n \nWe tested the ability of FC to generate resistance to the casual agent of bacterial speck \ndisease, Pseudomonas syringae. Unexpectedly, we found no increase in resistance. It \nhas recently been shown that virulent strains of P. syringae suppress PR gene \nexpression in tomato by activating jasmonate signalling pathways with the bacterially \nproduced JA analogue, coronatine (Zhao et al., 2003). If coronatine also suppressed FC-\ninduced PR gene expression, this could explain the lack of FC-induced resistance to P. \nsyringae. However, we found that P. syringae was unable to suppress resistance induced \nby the chemical elicitor, INA, and more importantly, treatment of plants with FC prior \nto pathogen challenge, to allow accumulation of PR proteins, did not increase \nresistance. We do not, therefore, belive that coronatine-dependent suppression of PR \ngenes is a major cause of the lack of FC-induced resistance in our experiments. \n \n18 \nRather than promote resistance, FC in fact accelerates and exaggerates the development \nof disease symptoms. Since this effect was not observed in the NR mutant, we conclude \nthat the increased necrosis seen in FC-treated P. syringae-infected leaves is a \nconsequence of abnormally high levels of ethylene synthesis during the infection \nprocess. Ethylene has been shown to promote the expansion of necrotic lesions in a \nnumber of compatible plant-pathogen interactions (e.g. Lund et al. 1998; O\u2019Donnell et \nal. 2001, 2003) as well as in some incompatible interactions (Knoester et al. 2001). \nLund et al. (1998) demonstrated that foliar disease development in tomato plants can be \nseparated into two stages with regard to endogenous ethylene. The early stage involves \npathogen infection and primarily lesion formation and occurs independently of ethylene, \nwhereas the later stage requires ethylene for the expansion of necrosis surrounding \nprimary lesions. Perhaps FC-stimulated ethylene production mimics the later stage of \ndisease development, promoting early and massive leaf necrosis. It is also possible that \nthe over-production of ethylene caused by FC masks an underlying FC-induced \nresistance mechanism suggested by defence gene expression, or that a real FC-induced \nresistance response exists that is specific to pathogens other than P. syringae. \n \nThe link between increased H+-ATPase activity and defence gene expression and\/or \npathogen resistance is now well established in several systems (Roberts and Bowles \n1999; Zhou et al. 2000; Madhu et al. 2001; Frick and Schaller 2002). What is unclear, \nhowever, is whether these responses generate effective resistance against some or all \npathogens, and whether some plant species use H+-ATPase signalling as part of their \ndefence against pathogens more than others. At least in tomato, FC-induced defence \ngene expression cannot be linked with known defence signalling pathways such as the \n19 \nJA, ethylene or SA-dependent pathways, nor with the generation of ROS or Ca2+ \nsignalling. Whilst FC application can provide resistance against powdery mildew in \nbarley (Zhou et al. 2000), it remains to be seen whether activation of the H+-ATPase, by \nFC or otherwise, is sufficient to generate bona fide pathogen resistance in plants such as \ntomato. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Jonathon Jones for the gift of nahG tomato seeds, and Guy de Bruxelles for \ncritical reading of the manuscript and useful suggestions throughout  the project.
