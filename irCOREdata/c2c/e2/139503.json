In this work we report the core-shell structures of micro-composites\nof SiO2\/Ni, SiO2\/Fe3O4, and nano-composites of BaTiO3\/Fe3O4 and PZT\/Fe3O4. These\ncomposites were prepared by an aqueous chemical synthesis method and characterised by\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX)\nanalysis and Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM) before and after incorporation into the\ncore-shell structure. The composite core-shell structures were formed by the control of the\nsurface charges of particles in aqueous solutions. A specific composite (SiO2\/Ni, SiO2\/Fe3O4 and\nBaTiO3\/Fe3O4 and PZT\/Fe3O4 nano-composites) can be produced by controlling the pH and the\nmolar ratio of components. These magnetic composites can be potentially applied in wide range\nof fields such as micro-reactors, delivery vehicle systems, drug delivery systems and\nmultiferroics.\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, core-shell structural composites have also attracted interest due to their coupling\nproperties. Hybrid materials with core-shell structure are usually composed of microspheric cores\nshelled with nanoparticles. The coating of nanoparticles on the core particles can be formed either\nby direct surface reactions or by controlled precipitation of the nanoparticles on the surfaces of\nthe suspended spherical cores [1,2]. Such materials may exhibit many unique electrical,\nmagnetic, optical or mechanical properties and therefore have attracted extensive scientific and\ntechnological interests [2,3,4]. For example, some biomedical applications, such as, tagging,\nimaging, sensing and separation [5,6], require core-shell magnetic nanoparticles. The most\npromising applications for core-shell magnetic nanoparticles relate to the diagnosis and treatment\nof cancer [7,8].\n2The magnetoelectric effect between two materials, such as a ferromagnet and a ferroelectric,\nrelies upon indirect coupling, via strain [9]. Strain coupling requires intimate contact between a\nmagnetostrictive (or piezomagnetic) material and a piezoelectric (or electrostrictive) material.\nThis can be achieved in composite and core-shell structures where the interfacial area is large.\nApplications of small particles with micro- or nano-core-shell structure need to meet two basic\nrequirements: a designable coating layer on the core particles and economical synthesis. The\ncore-shell particles with inorganic coatings offer interesting prospects in fabricating a broad\nrange of materials with different properties. From economical and environmental points of view,\nan aqueous method is preferable [10]. The processing of monodispersed nanopowders has been\nsuccessfully adopted; however, the methods to obtain nanocoatings are not well developed up to\nnow. In the meantime, a wide variety of methods have been explored and developed for the\nsynthesis of well defined coated powders, such as, heterogeneous precipitation [4], sol-gel\nprocess [11], hydrothermal synthesis [12], homogeneous precipitation [13], electrochemical\nmethod [3], inverse microemulsion [14], emulsion evaporation [15], and spray drying [16].\nIn this study, we fabricated the various micro- or nano-particles using different chemical\nsynthesis methods. The core-shell nanocomposites were fabricated using the immobilization of\nprepared magnetic Ni or Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of SiO2 or ferroelectric BaTiO3 or\nPb(Zr,Ti)O3 particles by adjusting pH values in order to control their zeta potential. Moreover,\nthe structural as well as magnetic differences between the composites with different sized cores\nhave been compared.\nExperimental\nPreparation of nanoparticles. Magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a chemical\nsolution method described in [17]. The hollow silica particles were synthesized by a combination\nof sol-gel process and water-in-oil (W\/O) emulsion based on the work described in [18]. The\nfinal powder was calcined at 700 oC for 8 hrs in a furnace. Monodisperse nickel nanopowders\nwere synthesized by wet-chemical method [19]. BT and PZT nanoparticles were synthesized by\nhydrothermal synthesis described by Clark [5] and by Deng [6].\nPreparation of Ni- and Fe3O4 - coated SiO2, BT, and PZT particles. For the synthesis of core-\nshell structures the core particles, for example SiO2, BT or PZT were suspended in deionised\nwater in a volumetric flask with a concentration of 0.1g\/L. The suspension was then placed in an\nultrasonic bath for 30 min. At this point, the pH of the suspension was adjusted by adding HCl or\nKOH to the value given by the measurement of Zeta potential. Similarly, in another volumetric\nflask, Ni or Fe3O4 shell particles were suspended in deionised water and the particle concentration\nwas dependent on the coated thickness. The suspension was also placed in an ultrasonic bath for\n30 min and the pH of the suspension was adjusted as for the core solutions. Based on the\nmeasurements of Zeta potential of particle colloids in water, core and shell particles would\nproduce opposite surface charges at the certain pH regions. The core and shell particle colloids\nwith such pH values were then mixed and placed to the orbital shaker for 30 min. The\nelectrostatic force on the surfaces of the core and shell particles would make the attraction of\ndifferent charged particles to each other and thus form a core-shell structure. The core-shell\nparticles were then dried in the oven at 40 \u00baC overnight.\n3Structural and magnetic characterization. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was\nperformed on a Philips CM 20 operating at 200 kV, and scanning electron microscopy (S-FEG\nSEM) was performed on a Philips XL30. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a\nSiemens D5005 diffractometer with CuK\u03b1 radiation and a Goebel mirror. The crystallite size is\ndetermined from the X-ray line broadening using Scherrer formula given by D = 0.9 \u03bb \/ \u03b2 cos \u03b8,\nwhere D is the average crystallite size, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength used (1.5406 \u00c5), \u03b2 is the angular\nline width of half maximum intensity and \u03b8 is the Bragg\u2019s angle in degree. The pH values of\nparticles in water were measured using a Jenway 3540 pH meter. Electrophoresis measurements\nwere performed using a Malvern Zetasizer 3000. The magnetic properties of the products were\ncharacterized using a Princeton Measurements Corporation vibrating sample magnetometer\n(VSM).\nResults and discussion\nFig. 1 shows the SEM images of (a) Ni and the TEM image of (b) Fe3O4. The average size of\nSiO2, BT, PZT, Ni and Fe3O4 particles is about 15 \u03bcm, 130 nm, 1 \uf06dm, 90 ~100 nm and 10 nm,\nrespectively. SiO2, BT and Ni particles are spherical while PZT particles are more or less cubic.\nExcept for SiO2, all the particles showed a narrow particle distribution. Due to the large surface\nto volume ratio and strong magnetic attraction forces, the Ni and Fe3O4 nanoparticles tend to\nagglomerate in order to minimize the total surface energy of the system.\n4Figure 1: SEM and TEM images of particles and core-shell particles. a: Ni ; b: Fe3O4 (TEM); c:\nSiO2\/Ni; d: SiO2\/Fe3O4; e:BT\/Fe3O4; f: PZT\/Fe3O4.\nFig. 2 shows the zeta potential values of the SiO2, BT, PZT, Fe3O4 and Ni particles in water as a\nfunction of pH. Zeta potential measurement gives the information about the overall surface\ncharge of the particles and how this is affected by the changes in the environment (e.g. pH). The\nmeasured colloid suspensions were prepared without adding any surfactant. The results of the\nelectrophoresis measurements revealed that the zeta potentials of core (SiO2, BT and PZT) and\nshell (Ni and Fe3O4) particles have opposite signs in some pH regions, for example, at 4.3 <\npH < 9.0, the zeta potential for SiO2 particles was between 0 and - 40 mV while the zeta potential\nof Fe3O4 particles was between +30 and 0 mV. This allowed for the easy attachment of the Fe3O4\nparticles on the surface of SiO2 particles at this pH region, similarly, of the Ni particles on the\nsurface of SiO2 particles at 4.3 < pH < 10.7, of the Fe3O4 particles on the surface of BT and PZT\nparticles at 4.2 < pH < 9.0 and 5.1 < pH < 9.0, respectively.\nc d\nba\ne f\n5-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n0 5 10 15pH\nZe\nta\npo\nte\nnt\nia\nl(\nm\nV)\nNi\nFe3O4\nBT\nPZT\nSiO2\nFigure 2: Zeta potentials of SiO2, BaTiO3, PZT, Fe3O4 and Ni particles in water as function of\npH. Adjustment of the pH was carried out by adding standard HCl and KOH solutions.\nSEM was also employed to examine the morphology of the coated particles (Fig 1, c-f). In\ncomparison with the neat particles (Fig1, a-b), the coated particles have a rough surface. The\nferrite coating is confirmed from the change in size, shape and the presence of Fe element in the\nparticle determined from EDX (data not shown). The SiO2 particles remain spherical after they\nwere coated with Ni (Fig 1, c) or Fe3O4 (Fig 1, d). The PZT crystals with cubic shape have a\nsmooth edge after they were coated with Fe3O4 (Fig 1, f). The thickness of the shell can be\ncontrolled through the mediation of the ratio of core and shell particles and the reaction time. It is\nworth to note that the higher the shell particle concentration is, the rougher the coated surface is.\nThis is understandable because the higher concentration of shell particles leads to multi-layer\ncoating. Shell morphology is strongly dependent on the parameters, such as, pH values,\nsuspension concentration and the core-shell particle ratio.\nXRD patterns for core-shell particles (such as SiO2\/Ni, SiO2\/Fe3O4, BaTiO3\/Fe3O4 and\nPZT\/Fe3O4) have been carried out (data not shown). For the purpose of comparison, the XRD\npatterns of the core and the shell particles were also measured (data not shown). In the case of Ni\nparticles and Ni coated SiO2, three characteristic peaks for nickel (2\u03b8\uf020= 44.5\u00ba, 51.8\u00ba, and 76.4\u00ba),\ncorresponding to Miller indices (111), (200), and (222), were observed. This revealed that the\nresultant particles were pure face-centred cubic (fcc) nickel at both samples (JCPDS, No. 04-\n0850). The XRD patterns reveal that only nickel is detected. Although it is known that nickel is\neasily oxidized to oxides, some possible oxides such as NiO, Ni2O3 are not observed in the XRD\nprofiles. Because the core-shell samples have been exposed to the air and water for a long time\nduring the synthesis, the absence of nickel oxides also indicates that the current synthetic method\nfor Ni coated core-shell structure is feasible in achieving metallic Ni coated core-shell structure.\nThe calculated size values for both pure Ni and coated Ni by Scherrer formula at 2\u03b8 of 44.5\u00ba are \ngeneral approximates to that of SEM observation (Fig. 1).\n6The Fe3O4 coated particles were measured in the VSM at 300 K. Fig. 3 shows the magnetization\nversus field plots of the Fe3O4-coated particles. The magnetic curves of three samples exhibit\nferromagnetic behaviour (hysteresis can be seen in the inset of Fig. 3). All of the samples possess\na lower saturation magnetization Ms (Table 1) than bulk Fe3O4 (92 emu\/g) [20] due to the\npresence of the SiO2, BT or PZT. After normalizing the Ms values of core-shell particles to emu\nper gram of bare 10 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles (53.8 emu\/g [21,22]), the weight percentage of shell\ncan be crudely estimated (Table 1). Under the same conditions, the content of Fe3O4 coated on\nthe different surfaces is varied and this might be related to the relative size of core and shell\nparticles, their attractive force, and particle geography. The magnetic properties of Ni coated\nSiO2 particles were also measured at 300 K (data not shown) and Ms=7.8 emu\/g is 14% of the\nbulk value (55 emu\/g) [23] due to the presence of the SiO2 and e.g. surface oxidation.\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n-2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\nField (T)\nM\n(e\nm\nu\/\ng)\nBT\/Fe3O4\nSiO2\/Fe3O4\nPZT\/Fe3O4\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n-0.02 -0.01 0 0.01 0.02\nZoom\nFigure 3: Magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field for Fe3O4 coated particles at room\ntemperature.

Using a simple\nmethod, e.g. controlling the solution\u2019s pH value and thus the surface charges of core and shell\nparticles, magnetic nanoparticles of Fe3O4 and Ni were used to successfully coat the SiO2, BT\nand PZT particles in an aqueous solution. The resultant core-shell nanostructures were examined\nusing XRD, SEM, TEM and EDX. Shell thickness can be controlled through various parameters.\nThe saturation magnetizations of the Fe3O4 and Ni-coated particles were reduced by the presence\nof the non-magnetic core, which permits an estimate of the weight fractions.\nReferences\n1.
