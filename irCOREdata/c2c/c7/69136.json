Research in geography and \nmanagement studies has emphasised the different organisational strategies adopted by \nfirms as they seek to develop and maintain a competitive position within an \nincreasingly global economy.  This paper develops a new strand in this literature by \nadopting a cultural economy approach to argue that an important, yet comparatively \nneglected, aspect of the internationalization strategies of transnational professional \nservice firms is the role of certain \u201eiconic individuals\u201f and \u201ebrand leaders\u201f in \ninfluencing the practice of internationalization. Drawing on empirical research into \nthe burgeoning European executive search (headhunting) industry we identify a cadre \nof such individuals and brand leaders that act as resources other firms leverage when \ninternationalizing.  This highlights the importance of a cultural economy perspective \nin theories of internationalization of professional services and its value in moving \ndiscussions beyond purely economic analyses of competitive advantage. \n \nKeywords \nInternationalization, cultural economy, professional service firms, executive search, \n\u201eiconic individuals\u201f, \u201ebrand leaders\u201f \n 3 \n1. Introduction \n \nThe internationalization strategies of professional services have been of longstanding \ninterest to academics and policy makers (see for example Bagchi-Sen and Sen 1997; \nBryson and Daniels 2007; Bryson et al. 2004; Faulconbridge and Muzio, 2007; \nRoberts 1998; UNCTAD 2004).  Stemming from the ground breaking conceptual and \nempirical work of commentators like Dunning and Norman (1983), Enderwick (1988) \nand Marshall et al. (1988), geographical accounts of processes of internationalization \nhave become increasingly nuanced.  Work has focussed particularly on the role of \ntransnational professional service firms (PSFs) across a range of sectors including \nlegal services, management consultancy, accountancy and executive search (on which \nsee Faulconbridge 2008; Jones 2005; Beaverstock 2007 Faulconbridge et al 2008 \nrespectively).  These analyses have unpacked a range of organisational strategies and \n\u201espatial economies\u201f (Yeung 2005) adopted by transnational firms as they seek to \ndevelop and maintain their position in the global economy.   \n \nFrom a management studies perspective much research on PSFs has focused on the \nrole of organizational knowledge and human capital in the development of \ninternationalization strategies (for example, Alvesson 2004; Maister 2003; Morris and \nEmpson 1998).  Yet, in both the geographical and management studies perspectives \non PSFs, much less attention has been paid to the ways in which more cultural \ndimensions of the firm and economy such as corporate reputation, firm brand and the \ncharisma of \u201eiconic individuals\u201f, like the Saatchi brothers or Norman Foster for \nexample, are important in overcoming the difficulties associated with processes of \ninternationalization. In this paper we respond to this oversight by placing cultural \n 4 \ndimensions of firms such as corporate reputation, brands and charismatic individuals \ncentre stage in order to advance cultural economy perspectives of the \ninternationalization of PSFs. \n \nWe make this argument through an empirical focus on the executive search \n(headhunting) industry in Europe.  Our focus on headhunting is significant for three \nmain reasons.  First, from a cultural economy perspective, headhunting represents an \nimportant intermediary industry that reproduces elite labour markets (Faulconbridge \net al, in press).  However, despite the growing interest in other types of labour market \nintermediaries such as temping agencies (Ward 2004), professional associations \n(Benner 2003) and labour guilds within the \u201ecreative industries\u201f (Rantisi 2002) \ncomparatively little attention has been paid to headhunting (see for example Boyle et \nal 1996).  Second, headhunting is a comparatively \u201eyoung\u201f professional service, \nemerging out of the USA during the 1950s boom and only having a significant \nEuropean presence in the last 25 years (Faulconbridge et al 2008).  This allows us to \nexplore internationalization as an ongoing process in a way that is more difficult for \nmore \u201emature\u201f professional services such as accounting and advertising. Third, the \ncase of headhunting focuses attention on the challenges, as well as the opportunities \nassociated with internationalization.  Studying the challenges headhunting firms have \nfaced reveals a previously unseen role for corporate reputation, brands and \u201eiconic \nindividuals\u201f in internationalization processes.   \n \nWe develop our argument over four further sections.  The following section reviews \nextant understandings of the internationalization of PSFs and considers the value of \nintegrating cultural economy analyses into such accounts.  The third section locates \n 5 \nEurope\u201fs executive search industry within this literature.  Next, we explore the \ncultural economies associated with the internationalization of executive search in \nEurope, considering how iconic individuals and leading headhunting brands have \nbeen mobilised by firms in an effort to overcome the potential difficulties associated \nwith entering new geographical and sectoral markets.  Finally, we conclude by \nreflecting on the value of integrating perspectives from cultural economy into existing \ndebates surrounding the internationalization of professional services in geography and \nthe broader social sciences. \n \n2. Cultural economies of corporate reputation and internationalization \n \nIn many ways, the relative lack of attention given to the cultural facets of the \ninternationalization of PSFs is somewhat surprising since the value of carefully \nmanaging reputation and brand for corporate success is widely acknowledged in both \nacademic and practitioner circles (see for example Kellner and Lehmann, 2003; \nSchlutz et al., 2000).  Moreover, there is a growing literature examining how \ncorporate reputation and brands can be leveraged to increase shareholder value and \nmarket share (for example, Balmer and Greyser, 2003; Madden et al 2006; Pruzan, \n2001).  In order to respond to this lacuna, in this paper we engage with work on \ncultural economy to explore how corporate reputation, brands and charismatic \nindividuals are used to make new markets as PSFs internationalise.  Cultural economy \nis a diverse, inter-disciplinary field (for reviews see Amin and Thrift 2004; Du Gay \nand Pryke 2002).  At its broadest, it \n \n 6 \n\u201cserves to show [\u2026] the ways in which the \u201emaking up\u201f or \u201econstruction\u201f of \neconomic realities is undertaken and achieved; how those activities, objects \nand persons we categorize as \u201eeconomic\u201f are built up or assembled from a \nnumber of parts, many of them supplied by the disciplines of economics but \nmany drawn from other sources, including, or course, forms of ostensibly non-\neconomic cultural practice\u201d (Du Gay and Pryke 2002:5).  \n \nWithin this expansive intellectual agenda, for the purposes of this paper, work that has \nfocussed on the cultural economies of markets and market making is particularly \ninstructive.  In this respect, building on earlier work on the construction of markets \n(see Cochoy, 1998; Knorr Cetina and Bruegger 2002), research has sought to open the \nblack box of markets to reveal their reflexive qualities (Callon et al 2002) as actors \nwithin them are constantly assembling and re assembling the markets of which they \nare a part.  For example, Callon et al (2002) forward a processural approach to market \nproducts that emphasises the different kinds of knowledges (for instance marketing, \nlegal knowledge and technical specifications) used to \u201equalify\u201f or \u201esingularise\u201f \nproducts such that they can be bought and sold in market transactions. \n \nHowever, whilst Callon\u201fs work on the (re)production of markets (see also Callon \n1998) has been highly influential, it has also been criticised for neglecting the \ncomplexities and tensions involved in framing products within markets (Slater, \n2002a).  Critics argue that products are never totally qualified and disentangled from \nother relations (Lee 2006; Miller 2002).  In response, Slater (2002b) forwards an \nunderstanding of markets based around their constant stabilisation and destabilisation.  \nStabilisation refers to the strategies used to \u201eblack box\u201f products as \u201estable\u201f objects \n 7 \nsuch that markets can be \u201edelineated by virtue of their containing goods that are \nconsidered similar enough to be substitutable for each other and hence can be \nunderstood as competing with each other\u201f (Slater 2002b: 97).  Whilst stabilisation in \nsome ways echoes Callon\u201fs (1998) work on qualification, Slater (2002b) emphasises \nthe ways in which processes of stabilisation are competitive and conflictual as \ndifferent actors seek to use the stabilisation of goods to maximise their own position \nwithin the market.  Slater contends that these competitive processes can give rise to \nmarket \u201edestabilisation\u201f when market actors do not agree upon the delineation of \ngoods.   \n \nAs in Callon\u201fs (1998) work, a range of different forms of knowledge or \u201ecalculative \npractices\u201f is involved in processes of market stabilisation and destabilization.  \nHowever, in this paper, we limit our analysis to just one dimension: the role of \nreputation in efforts to stabilise executive search markets as headhunting firms \ninternationalise.  In order to develop our focus on reputation we draw on work from \nmanagement theorists (for instance, Sturdy, 1997; Clark 1993, 1995) as well as the \nsociological literature on brands (Lury 2004).  Using this literature as our starting \npoint, we identify two important dimensions of reputation for PSFs: \u201eiconic \nindividuals\u201f (particularly successful and innovative individuals in the industry); and \nbrand leaders (firms that are particularly successful). As such, we are less concerned \nwith the ways in which brands and corporate reputation are used to shape consumer \nbehaviour and more interested in the ways in which brand leaders and \u201eiconic\u201f \nindividuals are drawn on by firms within the same sector as they seek to \ninternationalise their operations and create new markets (demand) for their services. \n \n 8 \n2.1 Brands, reputation and professional services \n \nAn extensive literature has developed exploring the role of brands, image, identity and \nreputation for PSFs.  In this paper, echoing cultural economy research into framing \nand qualifying goods (as verbs) we follow recent work that emphasises the close \nrelationship between brands as object and branding as process and practice \n(Arvidsson 2006).  In particular, we understand branding as the process of giving \nmeaning to products and services (and hence increasing the producers\u201f profitability) \n(McCracken 1993).  Indeed, at one level brands, branding and the identities associated \nwith them have been shown to be vital tools for creating an identity for a product or \nservice (Keller, 1993), and in so doing help to \u201eframe\u201f and \u201estabilise\u201f the service \n(Slater 2002b). In particular brands enable a firm to distinguish its products from \nthose of competitors (Aaker and Jacobson, 2001).  At another level, brands, images \nand the reputation associated with them have been identified as tools for identity \nregulation in firms (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002).\n1\n  As K\u00e4rreman and Rylander \n(2008) show, workers often model their behaviour on the brand images and identities \nprojected by the management of the firm in publicity material. As a result the way \nmanagers manipulate the brand affects how, in PSFs, workers engage with clients.  \n \nIn the case of PSFs the important role of brand and reputation has significant \nimplications because of the difficulties often associated with \u201eframing\u201f the product \nthat they offer (something that is particularly apparent in the headhunting industry as \nwe discuss below).  As Empson and Chapman (2006) reveal, clients assess the quality \nof a PSF using their understanding of its reputation because of the intangible and \ndifficult to assess nature of the knowledge-rich services they provide (see also \n 9 \nGreenwood et al 1999). Ironically, one outcome of this reliance on reputation is the \nproduction of PSFs with strikingly similar identities and brands. As K\u00e4rreman and \nRylander (2008) reveal, an obsession with professionalism, client service and the \ndevelopment of a skilled workforce means firms often focus upon the same elements \nwhen defining their brand (see also Maister, 2002). This is significant in the argument \nwe make later. \n \nHowever, whilst this literature on brands and reputation is instructive in revealing \nhow these cultural facets are important in stabilising the products offered by PSFs and \nhence (temporarily at least) stabilising (Slater 2002b) the markets in which they \noperate, it says far less about the ways in which these strategies are used to create new \nmarkets as PSFs internationalise (see also Pike [ in press] on the broader neglect of \nthe spatialities of branding).  In order to respond to this lacuna, we turn to work at the \nintersection between management studies and economic geography and the insights \nthis can provide into the spatiality of brands and reputation and their role in \ninternationalization. \n \n2.2 Geographies of internationalization \n \nThe starting point for much of the existing geographical work on the \ninternationalization of PSFs has been Dunning and Norman\u201fs \u201eeclectic\u201f Ownership-\nLocation-Internationalization (OLI) paradigm in which it is argued that firms will \ninternationalise using international regional and branch office networks if they have \ncompetitive advantages over host firms in each of the OLI competencies.  We do not \nhave the space to review this approach in detail here (but see Dicken, 2007) and \n 10 \ninstead we focus on how this approach has been developed by geographers in ways \nthat inform our argument surrounding the role of reputation and identity in processes \nof internationalization.  Here the work of Bryson et al (2004) is particularly \nsignificant.  They have developed the OLI paradigm with specific reference to \nprofessional services and argue that ownership advantage (in their terms firm-specific \nadvantage) is based not only on the knowledge of the firm\u201fs labour force, but also on \nthe reputation of the firm. It is argued that well-known and highly regarded \nreputations (at both the level of the individuals working in the PSF and the firm as a \nwhole) are important in fostering trust-based relationships between PSFs and their \nclients (see Gl\u00fcckler 2006).  Moreover, these trust-based relationships are particularly \nimportant when PSFs are entering new geographical markets in which their services \nhave not previously been widely available.  In these instances, PSFs have to \u201eframe\u201f \ntheir services in order to educate their potential clients in the value of their services \nand hence stabilise this new geographical market (Faulconbridge et al 2008; Coe et al \n2007).   \n \nA slightly different but equally detailed analysis of the role of reputation in PSFs in a \ngeographical context has also been fostered by Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster (2003). In \ntheir study they identify three related types of reputation important to PSFs.  First, \nwhat they term \u201epublic reputation\u201f defined \u201cas the perception of a [\u2026] firm\u201fs past \nperformance\u201d (Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster 2003:279).  This form of reputation is \ntypically accorded to large firms within any given market and cannot be devolved \ndown to the reputation of any one individual within the firm.  One of the main ways in \nwhich such a reputation is (re)produced is through the media including trade journals \nthat ranks firms in any given sector (for example The Lawyer; The Banker) as well as \n 11 \nthe mainstream press. Second, Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster (2003:279) identify \n\u201eexperience-based trust\u201f.  This dimension of reputation focuses on the relationships \nthat develop between those working in PSFs and their clients.  According to their \nargument, positive experiences from previous transactions are more likely to allow the \nfostering of ongoing trust based relationships going forward and, therefore, future \ntransactions between the two actors\u201f firms. \n \nThird, Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster (2003) highlight what they term \u201enetworked \nreputation\u201f.  As they argue (2003, 280), \n \n\u201cIf a trusted party cannot provide the resources that are needed, their relations \ncan be used in order to obtain trustworthy information about parties one is not \nconnected to. [\u2026] This mechanism communicates certainty through already \nestablished networks of trusted relations and thus helps to access additional \nresources.\u201d \n \nAs such, Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster suggest that clients use some elements of \nexperience-based trust to make their decisions but also publicly available information, \nthereby overcoming some of the weaknesses of relying solely on either public \nreputation or experience based trust.   \n \nThese management and geographical analyses are instructive in the ways in which \nthey tease out the different elements of reputation for PSFs.  However, they focus \nprimarily on how a firm or individual uses its own reputation to deliver services and \nfoster client relationships.  In contrast, in this paper we develop these insights by \n 12 \nconsidering how elements of one firm or individual\u201fs reputation are used by other \nPSFs in the same sector as a legitimation strategy for their corporate practices as they \nseek to internationalise. This subtle shift in focus is highly significant. It relates to the \nfact that, as noted, above, PSFs often seek to develop very similar types of identity \nand reputation, something that ultimately means firms are not, as existing literatures \nsuggest, solely reliant on their own performance for successful internationalization. \nRather, they can, on occasions, also exploit the identity and reputation of others in \norder to stabilise the market for their service and to avoid the destabilisation \nassociated with competing brands as they enter new geographical markets. \n \n2.3 Methodology \n \nThe research drawn on in this paper is based on 41 semi-structured interviews \nconducted with research consultants working in 21 of the leading headhunting firms \noperating in Europe and the professional bodies that represent these firms.  Interviews \ntook place between June 2006 and March 2007 in Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, \nLondon and Paris, lasted approximately one hour, and all except one was recorded \nand fully transcribed.  Interviewees were drawn from a cross section of career stages \nincluding senior executives (who importantly for this paper were often the founders of \nthe firm) to mid-career partners and early career researchers.  A member of the project \nteam also attended the Association of Executive Search Consultants Annual \nResearchers Conference in London in September 2006 and participated in and \nobserved discussions about the industry that were conducted there.  This interview \nand observational data was triangulated with content analysis of secondary data \nsources such as the mainstream and specialist press (e.g. The Financial Times, The \n 13 \nEconomist) as well as trade publications, notably annual reports from The Executive \nGrapevine. \n \n3. Internationalization and Europe\u2019s headhunting industry \n \nHeadhunters position themselves as specialists in the finding and recruiting of the \nmost suitable individuals for senior managerial or board level vacancies across a \nrange of economic sectors.  Almost all of the leading thirty or so transnational \nheadhunting firms are known as \u201eretained\u201f firms (Jenn, 2005).  Their retained status is \ndetermined by their high levels of repeat business with particular clients and by their \nfee structure.  Here their fees, of usually one-third of the candidate\u201fs first year \nremuneration package (usually exceeding \u00a3100,000), are paid incrementally during \nthe search, selection and placement process (Jones, 1989).  In contrast, many of the \nsmall and medium sized headhunters (especially sole proprietors) are \u201econtingency\u201f \nfirms because they have to pitch for business in competition with others, unlike the \nretained firms, and payment (depending upon the type of search and client\u201fs payment \nbudget) is only on the successful completion of the task.  Thus, for any one search and \nselection task many contingency firms may be employed by a client to drawn up a \nlong-list of suitable candidates for short list, but only one firm will ultimately be \nselected to continue the short-list and selection process (see Finlay and Coverdill, \n2002). It is this firm which will secure final payment.\n2\n  As such, the retained firms \ndifferentiate themselves from both contingency firms and other labour market \nintermediaries such as temping agencies (on which see Ward 2004; Coe et al 2007) \nthrough their focus on elite labour search and selection that involves retained work.   \n \n 14 \nRather than focussing on the practices of headhunters per se (on which see Jenn \n2005), this paper is, however, concerned with the internationalization of the retained \nindustry in Europe from its American heartland.  Faulconbridge et al (2008) argue \nthat this process began comparatively recently when the so-called \u201ebig four firms\u201f in \nthe US began to enter European markets, typically though London from the 1960s \nonwards (Heidrick and Struggles [1968], Spencer Stuart [1961], Russell Reynolds \n[1971], Korn Ferry [1973]).  This was accompanied from the late 1960s by the \nindigenous growth of European firms, primarily from London (Alexander Hughes \n[1965], Goddard Kay Rogers [1970], Saxton Bampfylde [1986]).  Finally, \nFaulconbridge et al (2008) argue that from the 1980s we see the Europeanization of \nthe industry.  This refers not only to the increasing presence of headhunting as an \nindustry in Europe but also the ways in which the practices of headhunting itself had \nto adapt to the changing cultural and regulatory norms surrounding recruitment in \nEurope as opposed to the US (see also Britton et al 1995).  Maps 1 and 2 clearly show \nthis pattern of headhunting firm office growth in Europe between 1980 and 2005.   \n \n [Insert maps 1 and 2 around here] \n \nWhilst existing studies of the internationalization of PSFs help develop a detailed \npicture of the growth of headhunting in Europe, in this paper we focus on the \nchallenges headhunting firms faced as they sought to make new geographical \nmarkets, something that remains an issue for the industry today as it seeks to make \nnew markets in South East Asia and Eastern Europe.  Through, our analysis we \nconsider how corporate reputation and iconic individuals are used to help overcome \nthe difficulties faced as part of a process of stabilising new markets. \n 15 \n3.1 Hurdles to internationalization for headhunting firms \n \nFour potential hurdles faced by internationalising headhunting firms as they seek to \nmake new geographical headhunting markets stand out as being particularly \nsignificant.  First, unlike the professions of the law and accountancy, headhunting is \nan example of a relatively \u201eunbounded profession\u201f (Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster 2003; \nMcKenna, 2006).  This means that to practice as a headhunter, individuals do not \nneed to register with a professional body, i.e. there are no barriers to entry.  Indeed, \nmembership of the main professional body representing headhunters internationally, \nthe Association of Executive Search Consultants, is optional and operates at the level \nof headhunting firms rather than individuals.  As such, headhunting and executive \nsearch are not protected titles and theoretically any firm or individual could trade as a \nheadhunter.  This results in significant \u201eimage problems\u201f for headhunters as the \nfollowing response from one of our research participants demonstrates, \n\u201cexecutive search is not a standard profession and a lot of people are in that area \nbecause they think it is quick money and they spoil everything, they spoil the image \nof the industry, they spoil even some clients because they pay a lot of money and \ndon\u201ft get anything, so professional standards are important\u201d (Consultant 3, Frankfurt) \n \nOur research participants frequently spoke of the difficulty and importance of \npresenting a \u201eprofessional\u201f image to potential clients. This is particularly important \nwhen entering new markets where potential clients have to be educated as to the \nperceived benefits of using a headhunting service as opposed to keeping recruitment \nas an in-house business function through personnel or human resource departments.  \nAs one interviewee put it,\u201c[I went to] India and I had to sell the idea of search, had to \n 16 \nsell the idea of retainers, had to convince people that having a contingent element in \nthe fee was not a good idea\u201d. (Consultant 3, London).  \n \nThe second significant hurdle for headhunters in terms of their internationalization \nstrategies lies in the fact that the boundaries between headhunting and other \nindustries, particularly other professional services, are not always clear.  In their work \non management consultancy Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster (2003) term this the problem of \nan \u201eunbounded industry\u201f.  In part, the fuzzy boundaries of headhunting reflect the \nhistory of the sector itself.  The industry started as an internal department within \nmanagement consultancy firms in the US in the 1950s.  Individual headhunters then \nleft these firms to establish their own executive search firms.  One of the earliest and \nmost significant examples of this devolution of headhunting out of management \nconsultancy was the departure of Gardner Heidrick and John Struggles from the \nmanagement consultancy firm Booz Allen Hamilton in 1953.  More recently, \nheadhunters are increasingly offering a range of services beyond simply executive \nsearch that in many ways echo their management consultancy roots including: \ntraining seminars for potential headhunting candidates; mentoring and coaching; and \nconsultancy on important business subjectivities such as \u201eleadership\u201f and \u201etalent \nmanagement\u201f (see for example Heidrick and Struggles 2005).  As a result of this \nassociation with management consultancy, headhunters have faced the challenge of \nneeding to legitimise and differentiate their industry both from other labour market \nintermediaries and professional services more generally.  In the language of Callon et \nal (2002), therefore, headhunting is a difficult product to \u201equalify\u201f.   \n \n 17 \nThe third potential hurdle that headhunting firms face lies in the fact that the service \nthat a corporate client and candidate (the headhunted executive) receives is very \nloosely defined \u2013 what Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster (2003) term \u201eunbounded product \nstandards\u201f or what Slater (2002) would identify as a product that is hard to \u201estabilise\u201f.  \nIndeed, whilst our research did point to a number of common elements in each search \nprocess, these were only minimum service standards.  Here is not the place to go into \ndetails surrounding the specificities of the headhunting process (on which see Finlay \nand Coverdill 2002; Jenn 2005).  However, one example illustrates our point.  The \nfirst stage of a typical search involves researchers and consultants in headhunting \nfirms using their existing knowledge and contacts to draw up a list of firms where \npotentially suitable candidates might be found.  However, precisely how this is \nachieved is vary variable with some firms relying more heavily than others on \nemerging online networks such as LinkedIn.com and naymz.com whilst others \nprioritise a combination of databases and previous contacts. So one interviewee noted \nhow \u201cWe don\u201ft rely very much on databases because the researcher is assigned to \nonly one project at a time, all projects start at square one, we speak to people but you \nnever find the person from the database\u201d (Brussels 8). But another suggested that \u201cA \nsubstantial difference is when you have an integrated global database, well \nmaintained, this gives everybody access to what has been launched over the years, I \nthink that is a definite advantage\u201d (Brussels 9).  This variability in the nature of \nheadhunting as a set of practices is potentially problematic if headhunters are seeking \nto enter a new market where the industry is not widely used since different firms will \nbe educating potential corporate clients in different styles of headhunting, potentially \ncompromising the effective institutionalization and market stabilisation of executive \nsearch. \n 18 \nThe fourth and final potential hurdle to internationalization for headhunters lies in the \n\u201etransactional risk\u201f (Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster 2003) of the \u201eproduct\u201f they are offering.  \nIn common with professional services more generally, the specialised, bespoke nature \nof the service offered by headhunters means that deep, trust based relationships need \nto be fostered between headhunting firms, candidates and corporate clients. However, \nthis is particularly acute in the case of headhunting since confidentiality is critical to a \nsuccessful search.  Candidate details must not become public information since \ncandidates are not generally in the job market and will not have informed current \nemployers of their interest in another position. Moreover, corporate clients do not \nwant shortlists of potential candidates to become public knowledge, particularly to \nshareholders who may decide that the firm is hiring the \u201ewrong\u201f candidate, something \npenalised by significant share price falls in financialized economies (Froud et al \n2006).  Therefore, as one interviewee noted: \n\u201cBoth the candidate and the client must trust the process and the candidate will feel \nless doubt and hung out to dry if you don\u201ft keep them informed as you go along and \ngive them the information they need to inform their opinion. At the same time we \nhave to remember that only one guy gets the job and there will be 3,4,5 really good \ncandidates, now we have to say no thanks to them and they should feel that hey this \nwas a worthwhile process even though I didn\u201ft get the job\u201d (Brussels 5). \n \nSuch trust-based relationships are particularly difficult to cultivate from scratch when \nentering a new geographical market and represent a further potential impediment to \ninternationalization.  In what follows we consider how headhunting firms have used \niconic individuals and leading firm\u201fs reputations to try and overcome these four \npotential limitations to internationalization. \n 19 \n4. Cultural economies of internationalization amongst headhunting firms \n \n4.1 Iconic individuals\u2019 and the organization of an international headhunting \nprofession \n \nThe relative recent growth of headhunting as a professional service allows us the \nunique opportunity to consider the role of the individuals who founded the first \nheadhunting firms in the subsequent internationalization of the industry.  We term this \ncadre of founding figures within the industry \u201eiconic individuals\u201f, reflecting their \ndisproportionate impact on executive search.  Similar figures can be found in other \nprofessional services (think for example of the banks Rothschilds and Cazenoves or \nthe advertising firms Saatchi and Saatchi).  As such, it is surprising that the role of \nthese \u201eiconic individuals\u201f has been comparatively neglected within extant \ngeographical understandings of the internationalization of PSFs. \n \nIn terms of headhunting, the most significant iconic individuals revealed by our \nresearch are listed in table 2.  As this table shows, the majority of these individuals \nbegan their careers in one of the \u201ebig four\u201f firms (Heidrick and Struggles, Spencer \nStuart, Russell Reynolds and Korn Ferry), sometimes as founders.  As such, these \niconic individuals form a network of elite headhunters with strong links and rivalries \nbetween them since they have often been colleagues or worked for one another. The \nnotable exception is Egon Zehnder who had no connections with the \u201ebig four\u201f prior \nto lending his name to his own headhunting firm.  However, this uniqueness echoes \nthe broader organisational culture and business model employed by Egon Zehnder in \nwhich independence is highly valued.  \n 20 \nAt the most basic level, these individuals are important figures in the growth of \nheadhunting simply because they worked in leading firms and\/or went on to found \nfirms who have facilitated the growth of the industry.  This was widely commented on \nby our research participants,  \n\u201cThere are a few icons like Jurgen Mulder and his team who was originally a Spencer \nStuart guy, who moved in to Heidricks, he sold the firm to Heidricks because he \nrealised he was too domestic and needed an international angel, so there are quite a \nfew icons, but the business was dominated by on the one hand individuals who knew \npeople at board level, on the other hand there were a few groups like Jurgen Moulder \nwhere they had teams together\u201d (Consultant 1, Frankfurt) \n \n[Insert table 1 around here] \n \nHowever, they are also important in more subtle ways in understanding the \ninternationalization of executive search in Europe.  In particular, \u201eiconic individuals\u201f \nwere influential beyond their own firm boundaries because of how their headhunting \npractices were colonised by their admirers to address  two of the hurdles of \ninternationalization: first, the relatively \u201eunbounded\u201f nature of the executive search \nprofession; and second, the \u201eunbounded\u201f product standards\u201f (Gl\u00fcckler and \nArmbruster, 2003) that typify headhunting.  \n \nBeginning with the nature of headhunting as a profession, one of most significant \nproblems facing executive search, in common with other \u201enew\u201f professions such as \nadvertising and management consultancy, is the difficulty of using educational \nbackground as a way of regulating entry into the profession (on which see McKenna, \n 21 \n2006).  In contrast to more established professions such as law and medicine where \nonly individuals with certain educational qualifications are entitled to use the title \nsolicitor or doctor, there is currently not a requisite educational qualification for \nheadhunters.  Our research revealed that \u201eiconic individuals\u201f were cognisant from an \nearly stage of the importance of educational background in purveying a professional \npersona to clients. As a result they adopted their own de facto approach to \nprofessional closure through education by only recruiting employees from certain \neducational backgrounds that they felt would help to legitimate the service they were \noffering.  The following example was indicative in this regard and also highlights the \norigins of headhunting in the similarly unbounded \u201eprofession\u201f of management \nconsultancy: \n\u201cwhen I started I was personal assistant to Mr Russell Reynolds in New York [\u2026] he \nwanted to prove that we were or we are a consulting business like every other, \ntherefore we would hire people out of business school.\u201d (Consultant 1, Paris). \n \nImage problems associated with the unbounded nature of executive search reduce \ndemand for services in established markets such as the USA but in new and un-\nestablished markets can almost prevent demand from emerging altogether. \nOvercoming such identity issues was, therefore, especially important when sustained \ninternationalization became the norm in the industry. Because of the early \ninternational success of firms such as Heidrick and Struggles and Egon Zehnder and \nin particular because of the reputation and iconic status of the firms leaders in the \nheadhunting industry, the recruitment and education practices introduced by iconic \nindividuals became benchmarks for \u201ebest practice\u201f in international firms, something \nthat began to define the boundaries of the profession. The possibility of using \n 22 \neducation as a way of guaranteeing the quality of headhunting by restricting entry \nthus became a key tool to facilitate legitimacy and ultimately create demand in new, \nun-developed headhunting markets. Indeed, the idea of educational closure has been \ntaken up by the professional body for executive search, the Association for Executive \nSearch Consultants (AESC) in the form ongoing debates surrounding the value of \nadopting a Certified Researcher\/Associate Program that, in their own words  \n\u201chas been developed by the AESC in order to develop and improve the level of skills, \nethics and professionalism in research and to provide an objective standard in \ndetermining the quality of researchers\u201d \n(http:\/\/www.aesc.org\/article\/campus_certification [accessed 12\/06\/08]). \n \nThe second way in which \u201eiconic individuals\u201f have been important in enabling \nheadhunting PSFs to overcome the barriers to internationalization lies in their focus \non the \u201eunbounded product standards\u201f associated with the sector.  Here, iconic \nindividuals developed a particular vision of how executive searchers should be \nconducted at an early stage, hence \u201estabilising\u201f headhunting as a product, and echoing \nGl\u00fcckler and Armbruster\u201fs (2003) work on \u201eexperience based trust\u201f.  As the following \nexample demonstrates, iconic individuals worked on the assumption that headhunters \nshould develop lasting relationships with their clients, based on the success and \nquality of their previous searches: \n\u201cin 25 years I\u201fve never made a single phone call asking for business, but this is the \npure training of Mr [Russell] Reynolds who felt that in this business you don\u201ft need \nto ask for work, otherwise you are doing something wrong\u201d  (Consultant 1 Paris). \n \nAgain, such an approach became most influential as internationalization became \ncommon in the industry. As firms began to encounter the difficulties of establishing \n 23 \ndemand in new markets because of the fuzzy nature of their services, the reputation of \n\u201eiconic individuals\u201f and their work became a tool for legitimisation: \n\u201cyou speak to a secretary and you say it is Fillip Lerno from Heidrick and Struggles \ncould you please ask him to call me back, \u201ewhat it is it about?\u201f, just tell him it is Fillip \nLerno from Heidrick and Struggles, and if they don\u201ft then they are ignorant.\u201d \n(Consultant 2, Brussels) \n \nAs such, and again because of their cult-like status in the industry that led to aspiring \nheadhunters copying their idols, iconic individuals have set benchmarks for best-\npractice within headhunting that have been disseminated beyond the firms that they \nestablished and worked\/work for.  \n \n\u201eIconic individuals\u201f are, then, the originators of discourses about the importance of \npurveying both an aura of professionalism but also offering a standard of service that \ncan be the basis for ongoing trust-based relationships with clients. Such practices \noffered the opportunity to overcome the barriers to internationalisation facing \nexecutive search associated with the lack of clearly defined entry standards for the \nprofession and the lack of clear service standards by \u201equalifying\u201f (Callon et al 2002) \nthe service of headhunting. This allowed the \u201estabilising\u201f of the market for \nheadhunting as a service. The \u201eiconic individual hence became of real significance \nduring the internationalisation of executive search in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s \ndescribed above. And it is not only the activities of \u201eiconic individuals\u201f that are used \nin this way.  Certain executive search firm reputations are also important and it is to \nthese \u201ebrand leaders\u201f that we now turn. \n \n 24 \n4.2 \u2019Brand leaders\u2019 as demand creators through the enrolment of consumers  \n \nAs with other professional services, there is a clear hierarchy of headhunting firms \nwith a relatively small number of firms frequently topping league tables based around \nannual revenues, number of offices and number of consultants. League tables are \nproduced by trade publications, most notably The Executive Grapevine (see Table 1).  \nFollowing Dunning and Norman\u201fs (1983) \u201eeclectic\u201f paradigm, these leading firms use \n\u201eownership\u201f of their name as a brand to leverage as part of internationalization \nstrategies.  As the following examples demonstrate, this typically took the form of \nwhat Gl\u00fcckler and Armbruster (2003) term \u201epublic reputation\u201f with clients assuming \nestablished brand names could be trusted,  \n\u201cThat\u201fs why blue chips [companies] use blue chips right?  Heidrick and Struggles is a \nname that has been established for 53 years, we are the number 1 in search, we started \nsearch, just the power of the brand opens doors\u201d  (Consultant, Brussels 2) \n \n[Insert table 2 around here] \n \nHowever, beyond this relatively straightforward use by firms of their own corporate \nreputation, many headhunting firms do not just use their own brand to establish \nlegitimacy in the market and trust based relationships with clients, they also use the \nreputation of other \u201ebrand leading\u201f firms as a tool for describing, and benchmarking \ntheir own activities.  Aligning your firm with the identity and practices of better-\nknown competitors such as Heidrick Struggles proves your credentials as a \n\u201eprofessional\u201f and \u201etrustworthy\u201f headhunting firm, thereby helping \u201estabilize\u201f in the \nlanguage of Slater (2002b) headhunting as a product that can be bought and sold \n 25 \nwithin new geographical markets.  Two very different firms were particularly drawn \non for this type of \u201ebenchmarking\u201f by the smaller firms we interviewed.  First, Egon \nZehnder that in many ways is a unique headhunting firm.  It was founded by Egon \nZehnder in Zurich in 1964 and remains fiercely autonomous and distinctive within the \nindustry.  For example, it is the only leading transnational executive search firm not to \nbe a member of the professional association for headhunting \u2013 the AESC - and was \nformed in Europe rather than the US as is more common for the leading firms \ncurrently operating in Europe.  In terms of the ways in which other firms drew on the \npower of the Egon Zehnder brand, most commonly they focused on the fact that the \ncompany had a long and successful history within Europe and this longevity was used \nas a mark of the legitimacy of executive search and of the trustworthiness of \npractitioners (problems one and four). As one interviewee noted, \n \n\u201cYou need to be known in this business, Egon Zehnder they are known but they are \n50 years old, we are just 15 years old\u201d (Consultant, Paris 5) \n \nThe second most significant brand that headhunting firms operating in Europe used as \na benchmark against which to compare their operations was the US firm Korn Ferry \nwhich has a very different organizational culture to that found in Egon Zehnder.  Korn \nFerry was founded in 1969 in the US by Lester Korn and Richard Ferry and as such is \nmuch more typical of the types of firms that have driven the internationalization of the \nindustry into Europe in the last fifty years.  It predominately operates as a wholly \nowned firm such that its board of directors dictates the priorities and strategies for the \nmajority of its transnational offices.  Whilst Egon Zehnder prides itself on its \nestablished European history, Korn Ferry privileges what headhunters term a \n 26 \n\u201escientific\u201f approach to search.  This reflects a key debate amongst headhunters \nsurrounding the most efficacious way of conducting search with an increasing sense \nthat relying purely on personal contacts and a database of potential candidates is not \nsatisfactory.  Rather databases of potential candidates are carefully managed and \nupdated and combined with insights gained from research departments within \nheadhunting firms.  \n \nAs such, Korn Ferry\u201fs widely acknowledged leadership in headhunting search \nprocesses and practices means they echo the so-called McKinsey effect in \nmanagement consultancy (see Sturdy 1997).  Other firms increasingly benchmark \nthemselves against Korn Ferry in terms of their headhunting practices, particularly in \nterms of entering new geographical markets as this example shows,   \n\u201cWhen we go into let\u201fs say the Czech Republic [\u2026] it is not yet a sophisticated \nexecutive search market yet, the market the region is struggling to get on its feet to \nmeet European standards \u2013 they grab on any straw they can, therefore sometimes it\u201fs \na bit of a cowboy attitude.  Then in comes Korn Ferry who come in and follow very \nstrict rules and ethics so we have to educate the market\u201d (Consultant 9, London) \n \nAs such, the brand of Korn Ferry is used not only by Korn Ferry itself but also by \nother firms to signal to potential clients the expertise, service, quality and risk-\nmitigation they can expect from the executive search process (further addressing the \nissue of \u201eunbounded product standards in executive search). This simultaneously \nallows tighter definitions of precisely what headhunting is and how it differs in \nrelation to other professional services to be developed (further addressing the issue of \nthe unbounded nature of headhunting as an industry).  Interestingly, though, the fact \n 27 \nthat headhunting, like other professional services, is so intangible and therefore hard \nto describe and assess means that it is not necessarily disadvantageous for a firm to \nclaim to be like a rival in the same industry. In contrast to standard assumptions about \nbrands (e.g. Keller, 1993), and contrary to Slater\u201fs (2002b) suggestion that \ndestabilization often occurs within markets as competing products or brands erode the \nstability and coherence needed for market transactions to take place, differentiation \nwas not always important as executive search firms internationalized.  Consequently, \naligning corporate practices with those of \u201ebrand leading\u201f executive search firms was \nan important strategy in facilitating the recent growth of headhunting, particularly \ninternationally as it expanded its European activities.    \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nThis paper has adopted a cultural economy perspective, incorporating understandings \nof corporate reputation, iconic individuals and branding, to develop geographical \nexplanations of the internationalization of PSFs.  We have drawn upon literatures \nfrom the management and geographical perspectives on the \u201eharder\u201f aspects of \nunderstanding the internationalization strategy of firms (OLI paradigm for example) \nas well as the more culturally nuanced studies of professional services (e.g. Gl\u00fcckler, \n2006; K\u00e4rreman and Rylander, 2008) to present an original conceptual and empirical \nstudy of the role of reputation, iconic individuals and branding in stabilising \nheadhunting as a product (Slater 2002a; 2002b), thereby facilitating the entry of \nheadhunting PSFs into new geographical markets.   \n \n 28 \nEmpirically, our focus on the internationalization of the headhunting industry in \nEurope from the mid 1960s onwards draws attention to the ways in which the \nreputation of \u201eiconic individuals\u201f was used to organize the profession in a way that \nfacilitates internationalization. At the same time we have also shown that \u201ebrand \nleading\u201f firms were used, often by competitors, to legitimate headhunting as an \nindustry and educate new geographical markets as to the potential benefits of \nemploying a headhunter and their firm in executive searches.  These legitimating \nstrategies have been important in allowing headhunting firms to overcome the \npotential hurdles they faced in their attempts to internationalise \u2013 difficulties that were \nparticularly acute when compared to other professional services given the relatively \nrecent \u201einvention\u201f of headhunting as a standalone professional service industry.  \nHowever, important research questions remain concerning how the cultural \ntechnologies used to legitimate headhunting in Western Europe travel can be \ntranslated into very different socio-economic settings as Eastern Europe and Asia-\nPacific become important emerging markets for executive search.  Moreover, there is \nconsiderable scope to explore how such processes are played out in professional \nservices and PSFs beyond the executive search industry.  \n \nTheoretically, the arguments presented in the paper demonstrate the value of \nintegrating work in cultural economy on market making and stabilisation in order to \ndevelop understandings of the internationlization of PSFs.  Whilst a range of different \nknowledges are involved in processes of market stabilisation and destabilisation, our \nresearch has identified reputation, identity and brand as important not only at the firm-\nlevel (i.e. a firm benefits from its own brand and reputation) but also at the industry \nlevel as other firms exploit the tracks cleared by \u201efirst movers\u201f (brand leaders and \n 29 \niconic individuals) to stabilise headhunting as a product and hence enter new \ngeographical markets as part of their internationalization strategies. This \u201espillover\u201f \neffect has not been detected in previous studies but the case of executive search \nsuggests that it is an essential ingredient in the geographical expansion of PSFs.  \n \nAs well as showing how these ideas can be used to better understand \ninternationalization in professional service economies, the paper reveals how firms \ndeliberately engage in processes of market stabilisation that reinforce, promote and \ncelebrate the competitors and their brands and products instead of seeking to \nchallenge and critique them. This avoids the type of destabilisation that Slater (2002b) \ndescribes as being common in markets and allows members of the same industry to all \nbenefit from the opportunities created by a stable market. Of course, the fact that we \nstudied executive search and strategies adopted in a period when new markets were \nbeing sought rather than existing markets maintained is likely to be one explanation \nfor this apparently coherent attempt at stabilisation. This raises, therefore, interesting \nquestions about the dynamics of stabilisation and destabilisation during different \nperiods in a market\u201fs lifecycle (establishment, drive to maturity, maturity, decline and \nalso boom and bust) and the social relations between the cultural-economic practices \nof competing firms. Understanding such temporal dynamics may well help further \nenhance understandings of the ongoing internationalization of professional services as \nwell as cultural-economic theories of market making more broadly.   \n \nNotes \n \n 30 \n1 Alvesson and Willmott (2002) amongst others develop an intriguing argument about \nhow brands can be used to manage the behaviour of employees and encourage them to \ndeliver services in a way that conforms to the brand identity of the firm. This \nembodiment of the firm\u201fs brand identity by employees then, in turn, reinforces the \nbrand and customers\u201f awareness of it. Whilst relevant to the argument developed here \nin the sense that the embodiment of certain brands by employees can be part of the \nmarket stabilisation process, in this paper we choose to focus exclusively upon the \nbrands themselves and the strategic decisions made as these are developed to help \nqualify products and stabilise markets, not upon how the internal management tactics \nof executive search firms reinforces such strategies.       \n \n2 Given the highly secretive nature of the headhunting business, for both \u201eretained\u201f \nand \u201econtingency firms, it is impossible to source data on: an individual headhunter\u201fs \nremuneration package and bonus structure; the number of successful searches per \nannum\/per firm; and detail of the composition of the firm\u201fs fee income (derived from \nrepeat business and new searches).  Jenn (2005) suggests that a headhunter is usually \nexpected to complete on average 12 successful placements per annum and evidence \nform a wide range of industry-commentators (see above) indicates that all firms use \ncombinations of salaries and bonus structures to enhance performance and \nproductivity.  We have found no data available in the public domain which reveals \nbaseline salaries and bonus structures within different firms and European contexts, \nbut we can note that the by year end 2006, the combined billings of 18 leading \nworldwide firms (all retained) exceeded $2,000m (The Executive Grapevine, 2006). \n \n \n 31 \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis paper is based on work completed as part of the ESRC project RES-000-22-1498 \n\u201cThe globalization of the executive search industry in Europe\u201d.
