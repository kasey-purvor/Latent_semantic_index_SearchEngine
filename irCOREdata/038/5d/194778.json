This is the first X-ray\ndetection of a brown dwarf intermediate in age between \u224812 and \u2248320 Myr.

No emission is\ndetected from four proposed later-type Pleiades brown dwarfs, with upper limits to LX in the\nrange 2.1\u20133.8 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121 and to log (LX\/Lbol) in the range \u22123.10 to \u22122.91.\nKey words: stars: activity \u2013 stars: coronae \u2013 stars: individual: Roque 14 \u2013 stars: low-mass,\nbrown dwarfs \u2013 open clusters and associations: individual: the Pleiades \u2013 X-rays: stars.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nMagnetic activity, generating chromospheric H\u03b1 and coronal X-ray\nand radio emissions, is a ubiquitous feature of main-sequence (MS)\nlate-type stars (spectral types \u2248F5\u2013M7). Studies of these diagnostic\nemissions have found consistency in the character of magnetic ac-\ntivity throughout this range, despite the expected change in dynamo\nmechanism demanded by the absence of a radiative interior in stars\nof spectral types \u2248M3 and later. However, recent studies suggest\nthe magnetic activity of \u2018ultracool\u2019 objects, with spectral types \u2248M8\nand later, is quite different.\nThe observed persistent (\u2018non-flaring\u2019) levels of X-ray (LX\/Lbol)\nand H\u03b1 (L H\u03b1\/L bol) emission from MS late-type stars increase with\ndecreasing Rossby number, Ro = P\/\u03c4 C, where P is the rotation\nperiod and \u03c4 C is the convective turnover time, until reaching re-\nspective \u2018saturation\u2019 plateaus of L X\/L bol \u223c 10\u22123 and L H\u03b1\/L bol\n\u223c 10\u22123.5 (e.g. Delfosse et al. 1998, for M dwarfs). The fraction of\nfield stars showing persistent chromospheric emission levels close\nto saturation increases toward later spectral types, peaking around\nM6\u20137 (Gizis et al. 2000).\nHowever, around spectral type M9 persistent H\u03b1 emission levels\nbegin to plummet dramatically (Gizis et al. 2000). Among L-type\ndwarfs no rotation-activity connection is found: LH\u03b1\/Lbol contin-\nues to fall steeply toward later spectral types despite most L-dwarfs\nbeing fast rotators (Mohanty & Basri 2003). A proposed expla-\nnation is that magnetic fields diffuse with increasing efficiency in\nthe increasingly neutral atmospheres of cooler dwarfs (Meyer &\nMeyer-Hofmeister 1999; Mohanty et al. 2002), overwhelming the\n\u0001E-mail: briggs@astro.phys.ethz.ch (KRB); pye@star.le.ac.uk (JPP)\nimportance of a rotation-driven dynamo efficiency in chromospheric\nheating. Magnetic activity is still observed, however, in the forms\nof H\u03b1 flaring on some L dwarfs (e.g. Liebert et al. 2003), and flar-\ning and apparently-persistent radio emission from several ultracool\ndwarfs (Berger et al. 2001; Berger 2002).\nDetections of X-ray emission from ultracool field dwarfs are\nscarce. The M7 old-disc star VB 8 shows persistent and flaring\nX-ray emission levels of L X\/L bol \u2248 10\u22124.1 \u201310\u22122.8, similar to\nthose of active M dwarfs (Fleming et al. 1993; Schmitt, Fleming &\nGiampapa 1995; Fleming, Giampapa & Garza 2003). However, the\npersistent levels of X-ray emission from the M8 old-disc star VB 10\nand the M9 \u223c320-Myr-old brown dwarf LP 944-20 are at least an\norder of magnitude lower \u2013 L X\/L bol \u2248 10\u22125.0 (Fleming et al. 2003)\nand L X\/L bol < 10\u22125.7 (Rutledge et al. 2000), respectively \u2013 despite\nthe latter being a fast rotator (v sin i = 30 km s\u22121). Yet transient\nstrong magnetic activity is evidenced by the flaring X-ray emission,\nwith peak L X\/L bol \u2248 10\u22123.7 \u201310\u22121.0, that has been observed on both\nVB 10 (Fleming, Giampapa & Schmitt 2000) and LP 944-20, and on\nthe M9 field dwarfs LHS 2065 (Schmitt & Liefke 2002) and 1RXS\nJ115928.5\u2212524717 (Hambaryan et al. 2004). Interestingly, the tem-\nperature of the dominant X-ray-emitting plasma appears to be low,\nT \u2248 106.5 K, whether it is measured in the persistent (VB 10) or\nflaring (LP 944-20 and 1RXS J115928.5\u2212524717) emission state.\nWhile such low temperatures are typical for the persistent coronae\nof inactive stars \u2013 M dwarfs (Giampapa et al. 1996) and the Sun\n(Orlando, Peres & Reale 2000) alike \u2013 the temperatures of flaring\nplasma are significantly higher, with T > 107.0 K (Reale, Peres &\nOrlando 2001; Gu\u00a8del et al. 2004).\nAs very young substellar objects (t \u0001 5 Myr) may have pho-\ntospheres as warm as MS M5\u20136 dwarfs, an individual brown\ndwarf may experience a transition from \u2018stellar-like\u2019 to \u2018ultracool\u2019\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n674 K.

Brown dwarfs in star-forming re-\ngions are routinely observed to emit X-rays at high levels, L X\/L bol\n\u0002 10\u22123.5, arising from plasma at T \u0002 107.0 K, similar to those\nof dMe stars and higher-mass young stars (e.g. Neuha\u00a8user &\nComero\u00b4n 1998; Imanishi, Tsujimoto & Koyama 2001; Feigelson\net al. 2002; Mokler & Stelzer 2002; Preibisch & Zinnecker 2002).\nThe \u224812-Myr-old, low-mass brown dwarf TWA 5B, of ultracool\nspectral type M8.5\u20139, exhibits apparently persistent X-ray emis-\nsion at L X\/L bol \u2248 10\u22123.4, like younger brown dwarfs, but with\nT \u2248 106.5 K (Tsuboi et al. 2003), like field ultracool dwarfs and\nLP 944-20.\nAt around spectral type M8\u20139, between the ages of \u223c10 and\n\u223c300 Myr for brown dwarfs, persistent X-ray emission levels ap-\npear to fall by a factor of \u223c100 and coronal temperatures appear\nconstrained to T \u0001 106.5 K, even during flares and at high emission\nlevels. The population of brown dwarfs in the Pleiades cluster, 135\npc away (Pan, Shao & Kulkarni 2004), of age \u2248125 Myr (Stauffer,\nSchultz, & Kirkpatrick 1998) and spanning spectral types M6.5\u2013\nearly-L (Mart\u0131\u00b4n et al. 1998), is therefore crucial to understanding\nthe evolution of substellar magnetic activity and the conflict of a\nrotationally-driven magnetic dynamo against atmospheric neutral-\nity. ROSAT observations of brown dwarfs in the Pleiades detected\nno X-ray emission at the level of L X\/L bol \u0002 10\u22122.5 (Neuha\u00a8user et al.\n1999, hereafter N99; see Section 4.4).\nWe present a deeper X-ray (0.3\u20134.5 keV) observation of five\ncandidate brown dwarfs in the Pleiades (described in Section 2),\nusing the more sensitive XMM\u2013Newton observatory (Section 3).\nWe detect X-ray emission from the M7 Roque 14, investigate its\ntemporal and spectral nature, and place upper limits on the X-ray\nemission levels of the undetected brown dwarfs: Teide 1, Roque\n9, Roque 11 and Roque 12 (Section 4). We discuss the relative X-\nray and H\u03b1 emissions of these objects in the context of magnetic\nactivity on ultracool dwarfs and its evolution (Section 5) and close\nby summarizing our findings (Section 6).\n2 S A M P L E O F B ROW N DWA R F S I N T H E\nP L E I A D E S\nFive objects in our XMM\u2013Newton field have been proposed as can-\ndidate brown dwarf members of the Pleiades on the basis of optical\nand near-infrared (NIR) photometry in the IZJHK bands (Zapatero\nOsorio, Rebolo & Mart\u0131\u00b4n 1997a; Pinfield et al. 2000, 2003). Ob-\nserved and derived physical parameters are listed in Table 1. All\nexcept Roque 9 have published spectral types consistent with those\nexpected of \u2248125-Myr-old brown dwarfs. Further evidence for or\nagainst membership of the Pleiades and hence substellar status is\nsummarized below.\nTeide 1 is the on-axis target of the XMM\u2013Newton observation. Its\nstatus as a brown dwarf member of the Pleiades is well established on\nthe basis of its proper motion (Rebolo, Zapatero Osorio & Mart\u0131\u00b4n\n1995), the detection of Li in its spectrum and its radial velocity\n(Rebolo et al. 1996). It shows H\u03b1 emission with variable equivalent\nwidth, EWH\u03b1 = 3.5\u20138.6 \u00c5 (Rebolo et al. 1995, 1996). It has been\nsuspected to have a lower-mass companion from its position on a\nJK colour\u2013magnitude diagram (Pinfield et al. 2003).\nRoque 11 has an anomolous position on a JHK colour\u2013colour\ndiagram (Pinfield et al. 2003) but its radial velocity of \u22123.5 \u00b1\n7 km s\u22121 is consistent with those of other Pleiades members, and its\nNa I absorption is lower than that of field stars of the same spectral\ntype, indicating lower gravity, and hence youth (Zapatero Osorio\net al. 1997b).\nRoque 12 has a radial velocity consistent with Pleiades member-\nship (Festin 1998), low Na I absorption and is a strong H\u03b1 emitter\nwith EWH\u03b1 = 19.7 \u00c5 (Mart\u0131\u00b4n et al. 1998).\nRoque 14 has low Na I absorption and strong H\u03b1 emission with\nEWH\u03b1 = 17.0 \u00c5 (Zapatero Osorio et al. 1997b). It has been suspected\nto be a near-equal mass binary on the basis of its position in an IK\ncolour\u2013magnitude diagram (Pinfield et al. 2003) but no compara-\nbly bright companion with separation >0.1 arcsec has been found\n(Mart\u0131\u00b4n et al. 2000).\nRoque 9 has no published spectral type but we estimate a spectral\ntype of M8 as its NIR photometry is similar to those of Teide 1 and\nRoque 11.\nWe shall use the term \u2018brown dwarf\u2019 to refer to all five objects, but\nnote that the evidence in support of substellar status varies across\nthe sample, and is weak for Roque 9.\n3 O B S E RVAT I O N A N D DATA A NA LY S I S\nThe XMM\u2013Newton observation, 0094780101, was centred on Teide\n1 (J2000: \u03b1 = 03h47m18.s0, \u03b4 = +24\u25e622\u203231\u2032\u2032) and conducted on\n2000 September 1 in orbit 134. The thick optical blocking filter was\nplaced in front of all three EPIC detectors: the pn (Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001)\nwas exposed for 40.6 ks and each MOS (M1 and M2; Turner et al.\n2001) for 33.0 ks, beginning 7.5 ks later. The data were processed\nusing the SCIENCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM (SAS) v5.4.1 1 and each EPIC\nevent list was further filtered to exclude flagged \u2018bad\u2019 events, and\nuncalibrated event patterns (>12 for MOS; >4 for pn). Several\nshort intervals affected by high background were also excluded. We\nconsidered only events with PI in the range 300\u20134500 (nominally\nenergies of 0.3\u20134.5 keV, and PI is reported in units of eV or keV\nfrom this point) to reduce background contamination.\nWe extracted an image with 4 \u00d7 4 arcsec2 pixels from each detec-\ntor and performed source detection in each image. The procedure,\nusing tasks available in SAS, is described in detail in Briggs & Pye\n(in preparation). In brief, potential sources were located using a\nwavelet detection package (EWAVELET), and masked out of the pho-\nton image while it was adaptively smoothed (using ASMOOTH) to\ngenerate a model of the background. The spatial variation of vi-\ngnetting and quantum efficiency was modelled in an exposure map\n(produced using EEXPMAP). The images, background and exposure\nmaps 2 of the three EPIC instruments were also mosaicked to op-\ntimize the sensitivity of the analysis and EWAVELET was used to\nlocate potential sources in the EPIC image. In each image, at the\nposition of each EWAVELET source, a maximum likelihood fitting of\nthe position-dependent instrument point spread function (PSF) was\napplied (EMLDETECT) to parametrize each source and those with\nML > 6 were retained. EMLDETECT additionally reconstructed a\nsmooth model of the input image by adding PSFs to the background\nmap with the location, normalization and extent of the parametrized\nsources. We repeated the source detection procedure on 20 images\ngenerated from this model image using Poisson statistics, and 20\nimages generated from the source-free background map. We found\nin both cases a mean number of false detections per image of five\nwith ML > 6 and two with ML > 7.\nApproximately 130 X-ray sources were found, of which 34 were\nassociated with proposed members of the Pleiades.

The\ncorrected positions of sources associated with the Pleiades were all\nwithin 6 arcsec of the NIR positions. The probabilities of a posi-\ntional coincidence within 6 arcsec of a brown dwarf with a spurious\ndetection or a source unrelated to the Pleiades are \u224810\u22123 and \u22480.02,\nrespectively.\nML-fitting was performed in each image at the NIR position of\neach brown dwarf. The successful detection of Roque 14 is de-\nscribed further in Section 4.1, and investigations of the temporal\nand spectral nature of its emission are pursued in Sections 4.2 and\n4.3, respectively. In no other case was an ML value >1 found. Up-\nper limits to the X-ray luminosity of these objects are calculated in\nSection 4.4.\n4 R E S U LT S\n4.1 An X-ray detection of Roque 14\nRoque 14 was returned as an X-ray source by EWAVELET in the M2,\npn, and mosaicked-EPIC images. EMLDETECT determined ML values\nof 2.1, 5.9 and 7.0 (1.6, 3.0 and 3.3 \u03c3 ) in these respective images,\nconfirming the detection at ML >6 (3.0 \u03c3 ) only in the mosaicked-\nEPIC image 3 (Fig. 1a). The best-fitting X-ray source position in\nthe EPIC image was 0.8 arcsec offset from the NIR position. We\nestimated the 1\u03c3 uncertainty in the relative positions as the sum\nin quadrature of the statistical fitting uncertainty, 0.73 arcsec, an\nuncertainty in the EPIC absolute pointing of 1.0 arcsec, and an\nuncertainty in the optical position of 0.5 arcsec; thus the positional\noffset of the source is \u22480.6 \u03c3 . The total number of EPIC source\ncounts determined by EMLDETECT was 24.7 \u00b1 5.9. We calculate\nthe X-ray luminosity after consideration of the source spectrum in\nSection 4.3.\nFurther analysis of the X-ray emission from Roque 14 has been\nconducted both including and excluding periods affected by high\nbackground, and no significant improvement has been found by ex-\ncluding those periods. Therefore, to maximize the number of events\navailable, we report on the results of including the short periods of\nhigh background.\nWe extracted source events from a circle centred on the best-\nfitting source position with radius 10.75 arcsec, which encloses only\n3 ML values output by EMLDETECT have been corrected as advised in XMM\nNews 29.\nFigure 1.

M1\nand M2 event lists were combined as these instruments have near-\nidentical sensitivity, spectral response and exposure length. A total\nof 32 counts in all EPIC instruments (23 from pn and nine from the\ntwo MOS cameras) was extracted from the source region and 140 (99\npn; 41 MOS) counts from the background region. Thus we expect\n17.5 (12.4 pn; 5.1 MOS) background counts in the source region. As\nthe background region will contain \u224846 per cent of the \u224825 source\ncounts, we expect a contribution of source counts (\u22481.4) similar to\nthe 1\u03c3 uncertainty (\u22481.2) in the estimated mean background counts.\nThe probability of 32 counts or more appearing in the source region\nas a result of a Poissonian fluctuation in a mean background of 17.5\ncounts is 0.0011 (3.2 \u03c3 ), in support of the EMLDETECT detection.\nThe events extracted from the source region were used to examine\nthe temporal and spectral behaviour of Roque 14. Events were ex-\ntracted from a larger source-free region on the same CCD as Roque\n14 to make a better model of the time and energy distribution of the\nbackground.\n4.2 Transient or persistent emission?\nExamination of the arrival times of the photons in the source event\nlist suggests a concentration, particularly of lower-energy (0.3\u20131.4\nkeV) events, in the \u224810-ks interval 10\u201320 ks after the start of the\npn exposure (Fig. 2).\nWe investigated the statistical significance of this possible vari-\nability using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K\u2013S) statistic.

As our test model must ac-\ncount for the significant number of background events in the source\nextraction region, which is subject to Poissonian fluctuations about\nits expected number, we have performed Monte Carlo simulations\nto assess the confidence level of deviation from the test model as a\nfunction of K\u2013S value.\nOur test-model CDF was constructed from the arrival times of\nevents in the background extraction region and arrival times of a\nnumber of source events (such that the ratio of source-to-background\ncounts was as estimated from the observed data) chosen at uniform\nintervals in the CDF of a constant count-rate source. Sets of arrival\ntimes for pn and MOS events were constructed separately and then\nmerged before calculating the test-model CDF for all EPIC data\n(Fig. 3a).\nEach trial data set in our simulations was composed of the ob-\nserved numbers of pn (23) and MOS (9) events. The number of\nbackground events was drawn from a Poisson distribution with\nmean value as estimated from the data. Arrival times for these back-\nground events were drawn at random from the observed distribution\nfor background events. Arrival times for the remaining events were\ndrawn at random from the modelled distribution for source events.\nMOS and pn data sets were again constructed separately before\nbeing combined. For each trial data set the K\u2013S statistic was calcu-\nlated. The CDF of these K\u2013S values gives the confidence level of\ndeviation from the test model as a function of measured K\u2013S value\n(Fig. 4a).\nThe simulated distribution of K\u2013S values for a test model of\na constant source count-rate, based on 10 000 trials, is practically\nindistinguishable from the standard calculated distribution. The K\u2013S\nvalue of the observed data set for this test model is 0.110 (Fig. 3c),\nwhich corresponds to just 20 per cent confidence that the source\ncount rate is not constant. Following the same procedure, we have\nadditionally tested models in which the source emission is purely\ntransient (Fig. 3a), with the profile of fast (here, instantaneous) rise\nand exponential decay typical of flares on late-type stars, beginning\n10 ks after the start of the pn observation. For short decay time-\nFigure 3. Cumulative distribution functions of event arrival times (a and\nc) and PI values (b and d).

The K\u2013S test rules out flare models with decay time-\nscale of 3 ks or less at the 90 per cent confidence level, but permits\nthose with time-scale 4 ks or longer (Fig. 3c).\nWe therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the observed\nemission from Roque 14 was due to a flare-like outburst similar to\nthose with decay time-scales of \u223c5 ks seen from the M9 ultracool\ndwarfs LP 944-20 (Rutledge et al. 2000), LHS 2065 (Schmitt &\nLiefke 2002), and RXS J115928.5-524717 (Hambaryan et al. 2004).\n4.3 Temperature of X-ray emitting plasma\nFig. 2 suggests the excess of counts was chiefly in the low-energy\n(0.3\u20131.4 keV) band, indicative of plasma with temperature T \u0001\n107.25 K typical in coronae on late-type stars.\nWe attempted to constrain the source temperature by implement-\ning a K\u2013S test of the PI values of the observed events, as described\nabove for arrival times.

Thus, the total MOS-equivalent effective exposure time\nfor Roque 14 was 117.6 ks, its MOS-equivalent count-rate was\n2.1 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 count s\u22121, and its time-averaged X-ray lumi-\nnosity was 3.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121, with L X\/L bol \u2248 10\u22123.05.

The expected number\n4 A source detected by a previous analysis 15 arcsec from Roque 9 only in\nthe 0.8\u20131.5 keV band is not recovered in this procedure, and was in any case\nconsidered more likely to be the chance alignment of a background source\n(Briggs & Pye 2003b).\n5 For a T = 107.0 K plasma with solar abundances and N H = 2 \u00d7\n1020 cm\u22122 the 0.3\u20131.4 keV energy band enables detection at a given signal-\nto-noise ratio against the observed background spectrum for the lowest total\nof 0.3\u20134.5 keV source counts. The required number of source counts is\nonly slowly increasing with the upper energy bound up to 4.5 keV and we\ndo not find better constraint of the Roque 14 source variability or plasma\ntemperature using this stricter energy cut.\nof background counts was estimated from the value at the source\nposition in the reconstructed image generated by EMLDETECT in the\n0.3\u20131.4 keV band. This enabled us to account for stray counts from\nnearby sources, and we note that the respective backgrounds for\nTeide 1 and Roque 11 were thus 25 and 36 per cent higher than the\nvalues at those positions in the ASMOOTH background map. Upper\nlimits to the source counts at 95 per cent confidence were calculated\nusing the Bayesian method described by Kraft, Burrows & Nousek\n(1991).\nThese upper limits were corrected for the enclosed energy fraction\nat the source off-axis angle (0.40\u20130.46 for a radius of 8 arcsec;\nGhizzardi 2002) and converted to MOS-equivalent count rates by\ndividing by the value at the source position in the MOS-equivalent\nEPIC exposure map. The assumption of a 107.0 K plasma with solar\nabundances and N H = 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 gives a MOS count-to-flux\nconversion factor of 7.2 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 per (0.3\u20131.4 keV)\ncount s\u22121 and upper limits to the 0.3\u20134.5 keV X-ray luminosity in\nthe range 1.9 \u20133.4 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121, with upper limits to LX\/Lbol in\nthe range 10\u22123.10 \u201310\u22122.91 (listed in Table 2).\nTo optimize our sensitivity to the detection of X-ray emission\nfrom these brown dwarfs and to put the tightest possible constraint\non their mean X-ray luminosity, we constructed a composite image\nof all the available EPIC data in 1 \u00d7 1 arcmin2 squares centred\non the NIR positions of the four brown dwarfs (Fig. 1b). The total\nMOS-equivalent exposure time for the composite brown dwarf was\n439.3 ks. EMLDETECT detected the source \u224825 arcsec west of Roque\n11, but no source at the position of the composite brown dwarf. We\ncalculated an upper limit to the mean X-ray luminosity of the four\nbrown dwarfs of 1.1 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121 using the method described\nabove. This corresponds to a mean LX\/Lbol of 10\u22123.4. Deeper obser-\nvations or a composite analysis of a larger sample are required to\ndetermine if the mean activity level of Pleiades brown dwarfs lies\nwell below the saturated level.\nConsiderably lower 2\u03c3 (\u224895 per cent confidence) upper limits,\nto LX in the range 5.2 \u20139.5 \u00d7 1026 erg s\u22121, and to LX\/Lbol in the\nrange 10\u22123.83 \u201310\u22123.43, have been reported for these objects (except-\ning Roque 9) by N99 using a number of observations of the Pleiades\nby the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC). All\nfive brown dwarfs were included in seven separate exposures longer\nthan 1.5 ks of four different PSPC pointings in the ROSAT public\narchive; the total exposure time of each field ranged from 22.5\u2013\n39.9 ks. They were best observed in the \u2018Pleiades Centre\u2019 field, at\noff-axis angles in the range 14\u201324 arcmin. The longest of the three\nexposures of this field, 22.4 ks from a total of 35.4 ks, was not\nused in N99, probably due to a faulty aspect solution (Hodgkin,\nJameson & Steele 1995). We have recalculated 95 per cent confi-\ndence upper limits by applying the Bayesian method as described\nabove, using the broad-band (0.1\u20132.4 keV) images, background\nmaps and exposure maps of the six remaining archival exposures,\nand merging data from exposures of the same field. We used a va-\nriety of extraction radii in each field and further combined data\nfrom different fields obtained with similar enclosed energy frac-\ntion (calculated using Boese 2000, equation 9), to find the strictest\nupper limit for each brown dwarf. We were also mindful of avoid-\ning nearby X-ray sources detected by XMM\u2013Newton. Optimum en-\nclosed energy fractions ranged from 0.35\u20130.75. We converted PSPC\ncount rates to unabsorbed fluxes in the 0.1\u20132.4 keV band using a\nconversion factor of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 per count s\u22121, ap-\npropriate for a 107.0 K plasma with low absorption, as used in N99.\nFluxes in the 0.3\u20134.5 keV energy band would be 5 per cent higher.\nA distance of 135 pc was used to calculate luminosities (N99 used\n125 pc).\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 353, 673\u2013680\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n678 K.

Upper limits to LX\/Lbol were in the range\n10\u22122.4 \u201310\u22121.8. Hence, we conclude that the ROSAT observations\nwere not sufficient to detect Roque 14 at the level detected here by\nXMM\u2013Newton, and the current XMM\u2013Newton observation places\nthe strictest upper limits thus far to the X-ray emission levels of\nPleiades brown dwarfs of spectral type M7.5\u20138.\n5 D I S C U S S I O N\n5.1 X-ray emission from ultracool dwarfs\nWe have detected X-ray emission only from the M7-type Roque 14\nat L X\/L bol \u2248 10\u22123.05, and placed an upper limit to the mean emis-\nsion level from the four later-type Pleiades brown dwarfs at L X\/L bol\n< 10\u22123.4. This is consistent both with the pattern of emission from\nactive MS M stars, which scales with bolometric luminosity, and\nwith the idea that persistent X-ray emission levels fall around spec-\ntral type M8 as magnetic field dissipates more easily in cooler, more\nneutral lower atmospheres.\nWe can make some comparison of the character of the magnetic\nactivity of Roque 14 with that of other low-mass stars based on\nthe relative levels of chromospheric and coronal emission. Fleming\n(1988) has reported a mean ratio of L X\/L H\u03b1 \u2248 6.7 for a sample\nof the active, frequently-flaring, dMe stars and Reid, Hawley &\nMateo (1995) have reported a value of \u223c3 for M0\u20136 field stars out-\nside flares. Unfortunately, LH\u03b1 and LX are both typically variable\nand simultaneous measurements are scarce. Observed values and\ncalculated ratios of LX and LH\u03b1 for the H\u03b1- and X-ray-detected\ndwarfs VB 8, VB 10, LHS 2065 and LP 944-20 are listed in\nTable 3. We stress that these LX\/LH\u03b1 ratios are not calculated from\nsimultaneous measurements of LX and LH\u03b1 , but from a simple\nranking of the observed values of each. Nevertheless, a striking\nchange in non-flaring emission appears to take place between the\nM7 star VB 8, in which L X > L H\u03b1 and the M8 and M9 dwarfs\nVB 10 and LP 944-20, in which L X < L H\u03b1 (noted by Fleming\net al. 2003). This suggests that the efficiency of persistent coro-\nnal heating decays more quickly in response to the increasingly\nneutral atmosphere of ultracool dwarfs than the efficiency of chro-\nmospheric heating. Within the same sample, excluding LP 944-20,\ntransition region heating, inferred from C IV emission, appears to re-\nmain as efficient as chromospheric heating (Hawley & Johns-Krull\n2003).\nThe ratio of the single measurements of LX and LH\u03b1 from Roque\n14 is 4.0. If Roque 14\u2019s measured chromospheric and coronal emis-\nsions are interpreted as persistent, this suggests that its magnetic\nactivity is of similar character to that of VB 8 and active MS M\ndwarfs. Although we cannot exclude that Roque 14\u2019s observed X-\nray emission is solely the result of a flare with decay time-scale\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 353, 673\u2013680\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nX-ray emission from a brown dwarf in the Pleiades 679\n\u223c5 ks, like the observed high-level X-ray emission from M8 old-\ndisc star VB 10 and M9 dwarfs LP 944-20, LHS 2065 and RXS\nJ115928.5-524717, the high H\u03b1 emission level of Roque 14 sup-\nports a persistently higher level of magnetic activity than on these\ncooler dwarfs.\nRoque 14 has been suspected to be a near-equal-mass binary, but\nL X\/L H\u03b1 > 2 even if the X-ray emission is interpreted as coming\nfrom two stars. 6 An observation by the Hubble Space Telescope\nNICMOS camera does not support Roque 14\u2019s binarity, finding no\ncompanion of comparable brightness at separations >0.1 arcsec, or\n13.5 au (Mart\u0131\u00b4n et al. 2000). While interaction between two close bi-\nnary components could be influential in the X-ray production mech-\nanism, the emission is at a similar level to that produced by magnetic\nactivity on single active MS M dwarfs.\nThe observed strong H\u03b1 emission from the M7.5 Roque 12 hints\nat activity similar to that of Roque 14. In contrast, the measured\nH\u03b1 emission levels of the M8 Pleiades brown dwarfs Teide 1 and\nRoque 11 are very like that of the M8 VB 10, and we speculate that\nthe magnetic activity of these objects is already in the regime where\nL X < L H\u03b1 and their persistent X-ray emission levels are more than\nan order of magnitude lower than that of Roque 14. Deeper X-ray\nobservations are required to test this prediction.\n5.2 Evolution of X-ray emission from brown dwarfs\nVery young brown dwarfs in star-forming regions are now routinely\nobserved to emit X-rays at levels of L X\/L bol \u223c 10\u22124 \u201310\u22123 that arise\nfrom hot (T > 107 K) plasma (e.g. Imanishi et al. 2001; Feigelson\net al. 2002; Preibisch & Zinnecker 2002). A growing body of evi-\ndence indicates that young brown dwarfs experience accretion and\noutflows just like young low-mass stars (Jayawardhana, Mohanty &\nBasri 2003). Their X-ray emission is very likely to be produced by\nsimilar means to T Tauri stars. This is probably largely coronal emis-\nsion as a result of magnetic activity, as in older low-mass stars, and\nas young substellar objects may have photospheres as warm as 2900\nK (e.g. Baraffe et al. 1998), their atmospheric conditions are ripe for\nthe efficient coronal heating seen on active MS M5\u20136 stars. How-\never, H\u03b1 emission may arise predominantly from material accreting\non to the young brown dwarf, rather than from a hot chromosphere.\nX-ray emission levels appear to rise with H\u03b1 emission levels up to\nEWH\u03b1 \u2248 20 \u00c5, as would be expected for H\u03b1 emission predomi-\nnantly from a magnetically-powered chromosphere, but there is no\ndetection of X-rays from a young brown dwarf with EWH\u03b1 > 30 \u00c5\n(Tsuboi et al. 2003). This is consistent with the scenario emerg-\ning from X-ray surveys of T Tauri stars wherein samples of stars\nshowing signs of strong accretion, such as high EWH\u03b1 , appear to\nshow lower levels of X-ray emission than weakly-accreting objects\nof similar mass (e.g. Flaccomio, Micela & Sciortino 2003).\nX-ray emission has been previously detected from just two brown\ndwarfs older than 5 Myr. While any accretion is expected to have\nceased by the age of the 12-Myr-old TWA 5B, this object has a\nmuch lower mass than Roque 14, 0.014\u20130.043 M\u0006 (Neuha\u00a8user\net al. 2000), and is unlikely to be a good model for its youthful\nX-ray activity. Conversely, LP 944-20 appears to have a similar mass\nto Roque 14, 0.056 \u20130.064 M\u0006 (Tinney 1998). It has cooled to a\nspectral type of M9, so its lower atmosphere is highly neutral, which\nis probably the key reason why its persistent X-ray emission level is\n6 As LH\u03b1\/Lbol is calculated here from EWH\u03b1 , as a ratio with the continuum,\nit should be little changed whether there is one source or are two similar\nsources.\n\u223c100 times lower than those of many very young brown dwarfs and\nthe detected level from Roque 14. However, we should be wary of\nassuming that the activity levels of all coeval brown dwarfs are the\nsame, and that Roque 14 and LP 944-20 are representative of their\nrespective ages. There is a large spread in the observed LX\/Lbol\nvalues of young brown dwarfs, a significant number being unde-\ntected at upper limits <10\u22124 (e.g. Imanishi et al. 2001). Roque 14\nhas one of the highest H\u03b1 emission levels among Pleiades brown\ndwarf candidates (Zapatero Osorio et al. 1997b), while LP 944-20\nhas one of the lowest among M9 field dwarfs (Mohanty & Basri\n2003). So, while we may expect the X-ray emission level of brown\ndwarfs to decrease as they age from \u2248125 to \u2248320 Myr, as appar-\nently observed by comparing Roque 14 and LP 944-20, the effect is\nprobably exaggerated in choosing these two objects as representa-\ntive. Larger, and necessarily deeper, surveys of the X-ray emission\nof brown dwarfs in the field and in the Pleiades (and other clusters)\nare required to make further progress in understanding the evolution\nof the magnetic activity of substellar and ultracool objects.\n6 S U M M A RY\nWe have observed five candidate brown dwarfs in the Pleiades with\nXMM\u2013Newton, detecting X-ray emission from the M7 Roque 14.\nThe low number of counts and significant contribution of back-\nground counts prevent meaningful constraint of the temperature\nand exclusion of transient emission. Assuming a plasma tempera-\nture of 107.0 K and nominal absorbing column to the Pleiades of 2 \u00d7\n1020 cm\u22122, the time-averaged X-ray luminosity of L X = 3.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7\n1027 erg s\u22121, and its ratios with the bolometric (L X\/L bol \u2248 10\u22123.05)\nand H\u03b1 (L X\/L H\u03b1 \u2248 4.0) luminosities resemble those of active MS\nM dwarfs, as have been observed on the M7 old-disc star VB 8.\nWe have placed the tightest upper limits thus far on the X-ray\nemission levels of the four later-type Pleiades brown dwarfs: L X <\n2.1\u20133.8 \u00d7 1027 erg s\u22121 and L X\/L bol < 10\u22123.10 \u201310\u22122.91.\nThe XMM\u2013Newton data do not exclude the fact that Roque 14\u2019s\nobserved high level of X-ray emission is solely the result of a flare\nwith decay time-scale \u223c5 ks like the observed high-level emission\nfrom M8\u20139 field dwarfs VB 10, LP 944-20, LHS 2065 and RXS\nJ115928.5-524717, but the high H\u03b1 emission level of Roque 14 is\nsupportive of a persistently higher level of magnetic activity than on\nthese cooler dwarfs. However, the similarity of the low H\u03b1 emission\nlevels of Teide 1 and Roque 11 to that of the M8 old-disc star VB\n10 prompts us to speculate that the persistent X-ray emission levels\nof M8 brown dwarfs in the Pleiades may be low, with L X\/L bol\n\u0001 10\u22125, like those of VB 10 and the M9, \u2248320-Myr-old brown dwarf\nLP 944-20.\nDeeper X-ray observations, less contaminated by background,\nare required to confirm a persistent high level of X-ray emission\nfrom Roque 14, to assess its coronal temperature, and to probe the\ntypical X-ray emission levels of Pleiades brown dwarfs. Coordinated\nprogrammes to study X-ray, H\u03b1 and radio emission from ultracool\nand brown dwarfs of a range of ages are required to enable significant\nprogress toward understanding the mechanisms and evolution of\nmagnetic activity on these low-mass, cool objects.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nJPP acknowledges the financial support of the UK Particle Physics\nand Astronomy Research Council (PPARC).
