A large \nnumber of models have been proposed, many based on the Boussinesq assumption, which \nrelates the Reynolds stresses to the mean velocity gradient via a turbulent viscosity. \nTypically these models have been classified into zero, one and two equation models, \nreferring to the number of additional transport equations to be solved. Direct second \nmoment closure models are also available, although these tend to be computationally \nmore expensive and less robust and have consequently found less widespread application. \nThe Boussinesq based two equation models have demonstrated a good balance between \naccuracy and efficiency. In particular, the k-\u03b5 turbulence model of Launder and Spalding \n[1] has been widely adopted, where transport equations are solved for the turbulent \nkinetic energy (k), and the rate of dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy (\u03b5).  \nComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) is being increasingly employed to investigate \ninternal building flows, for heating, ventilation, and fire safety, where buoyancy effects \ndue to thermal gradients become significant. Various authors have proposed and tested \nmodifications of the standard turbulence models appropriate to buoyant flows, including \n    5\n[2,3,4,5,6,7]. Initial developments utilised the standard Boussinesq gradient diffusion \nhypothesis (SGDH) to represent buoyancy induced turbulence generation, which has \nsince been shown to be a significant component in the governing equations [2,3,4]. More \nrecently, the general gradient diffusion hypothesis (GGDH) of Daly and Harlow [8] has \nbeen investigated, as has the algebraic stress model (ASM) of Davidson [5].  \nThe effect of Richardson number, the ratio of buoyancy forces to inertial forces, is \nnot well understood in the production of turbulence, so an empirical term, the flux \nRichardson term, was introduced into the \u03b5 equation to account for this. Rodi [3] gives \nwhat is now the standard format for this term. \nHossain and Rodi [2] demonstrated that the SGDH gave significant improvement \nover the standard k-\u03b5 model without a buoyancy model, although Shabbir and Taulbee [9] \nlater found the axial heat flux to be inaccurately modelled with the SGDH.  \nRodi [3] suggested that the coefficient of the flux Richardson term should vary \nbetween 0 and 1 dependent upon the flow. Markatos et al. [6] found the flux Richardson \nterm to be insignificant in smoke simulations.  \nDavidson [5], and Yan and Holmstedt [7], found that the GGDH in conjunction with \nthe ASM gave significantly improved results.  Yan and Holmstedt [7] investigated these \nterms and found optimised values for the empirical constants when applied to a thermal \nplume. \nThe thermal plume represents an important benchmark simulation for any buoyant \nflow code as well as being a relevant flow in its own right, for example in atmospheric \nsimulations, and fire simulations. Considerable experimental work has been carried out in \nthis area, against which it is possible to validate turbulence models.  \n    6\nChen and Rodi [4] gave an extensive review of the experimental work before 1980, \nand gave recommendations of the velocity and temperature spreading rates, and also \ncentreline values. Later experiments including Papaniolaou and List [10], Shabbir and \nGeorge [11], Ramprian and Chandrasekhara [12], and Sangras et al. [13], have found \nalternative values. These works [10,11,12,13] have questioned previously accepted plume \nstatistics, complicating optimisation and selection of model components. However, the \nrelative significance of the individual terms can be clearly demonstrated. Future \noptimisation may be eased with these considerations. \n \nThis paper follows the work of Yan and Holmstedt [7] and investigates the \nmechanics of the different models for buoyancy induced turbulence generation and \ndissipation in the k-\u03b5 model.

(Eqns. \n13,5).  \niii)  The GGDH with the ASM model incorporated into the Reynolds stresses. \n(Eqns. 13,14). \nIn a numerical scheme, the last becomes recursive, and can be implemented using the \nvalues from the previous iteration. All were tested, but only the first alternative, the \nSGDH, substituted back into the GGDH gave sensible results.  \nRodi [3] found that the algebraic stress model showed no loss of accuracy when \nusing the equilibrium assumption, where the production is equal to the dissipation. i.e \n01\/)( =\u2212+ \u03b5GP . This is assumed here also. In equation 15 this is 01\/)( =\u2212+ \u03b5BP . \n    12\n \nThere is not a consistent literature on the flux Richardson term, fR . The fR  term is \nthe ratio of the rate of removal of energy by buoyancy to its production by the shear, \nPGR f \/= . [14]. An alternative definition given by Rodi [3] can be expressed as \n)\/( PGGR f += , in conjunction with the empirical constant \u03b53C  set to 0 in buoyant \nvertical shear layers and 1 in buoyant horizontal shear layers. Heindel et al. [15] let \n)\/tanh(3 VUC =\u03b5  for mixed flows (where U is the local horizontal velocity, and V is the \nlocal vertical velocity). In the present work, the definition of Rodi [3] was employed with \n\u03b53C  as a constant to be optimised. \nThe fR  term has previously been found to be insignificant in buoyant vertical shear \nflows. Markatos et al. [6] found that the G term in the k equation is far more important \nthan the coefficient of the fR   term in fire simulations, and that buoyancy has no effect on \nthe \u03b5-equation. Cox [16] references Bos et al. [17] as finding the fR  term to have little \neffect, also in fire simulations. These findings have all used the standard buoyancy \nmodified k-\u03b5 model.  \nThis paper investigates the relative significance of the P and G terms using the above \nmodels for the Reynolds stress and scalar fluxes. The following combinations of the \nabove models were tested. The acronyms are used throughout this work to refer to the \nvarious models.  \n \nORIGINAL: The P term is modelled with the Boussinesq assumption, and the G \nterm is not modelled and set to zero. The fR  term becomes zero in this case. P=PB. G=0. \n    13\nSGDH: This is the standard buoyancy modified k-\u03b5 model. The P term is modelled \nwith the Boussinesq assumption and the G term uses the standard gradient diffusion \nhypothesis. P=PB. G=GB. \nGGDH: The P term uses the Boussinesq assumption and the G term uses the general \ngradient diffusion hypothesis. P=PB. G=GG. \nASM: Davidson`s [5] algebraic stress model is applied. The G term is neglected. The \nP term is broken into the two parts; the PB (the Boussinesq part), and the PASM \n(Davidson`s algebraic stress model part). P=PB+PASM. G=0. \nASMSGDH: This is as the ASM model but the G term is modelled with the standard \ngradient diffusion hypothesis. P=PB+PASM. G=GB. \nASMGGDH: This is as the ASM model but the G term is modelled with the general \ngradient diffusion hypothesis. P=PB+PASM. G=GG. \n \nFor the ASM term, the SGDH model has been re-substituted back into the remaining \nReynolds stress terms. Only terms in the k and \u03b5 equations were modelled. The Reynolds \nstresses in the RANS equations were modelled in all cases using the Boussinesq \nassumption. \n \n \n    14\n             NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION AND SIMULATIONS \n \nThe numerical simulations were carried out using the code SOFIE (Simulation of \nFires in Enclosures), specifically developed at Cranfield for compartment fire predictions \n[18,19]. SOFIE is based upon a finite volume procedure utilising an underlying general \nnon-orthogonal coordinate system with co-located velocities, momentum smoothing and \na pressure correction algorithm. Dependent variable interpolation has a choice of \nschemes. A second order accurate TVD scheme was used in this work. \nThe planar plume was simulated in a rectangular domain of 2m base by 2.7m height, \nwith a 0.06m entrance width. For speed of calculation a mirror symmetry boundary was \nused along the centreline of the plume. A solid wall boundary was specified at the bottom \nof the domain. Static pressure boundaries were employed on the remaining boundaries, \nallowing flow into and out of the domain.  \nAt the plume source, inflow velocity was specified as 0.01m\/s with small values \n(1.0e-6) for the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rates and a temperature of 1000K. \nFlow into the calculation domain across the static pressure boundaries was specified \nwith a fixed temperature of 298.15K, turbulent intensity of 0.5%, and turbulent length \nscale of 0.01m. Flow out is evaluated to ensure local continuity at the boundary cells. \nThe computational grids were uniformly spaced across the plume entrance, and \nuniformly spaced along the remainder of the horizontal axis, with a single uniform grid \nspacing in the vertical axis. Four grid distributions were used, labelled A, B, C, D. Unless \notherwise stated grid A was used. Grid A had 4+50x50 cells where there are 4 cells \n    15\nacross the plume source and 50 cells across the rest of the base of the domain. B, in a \nsimilar manner, had 4+70x70 cells, C had 6+100x100 cells, and D had 10+200x150 cells. \n \n \n    16\n                                       PLANAR PLUMES \n \nChen and Rodi [4] presented a detailed review of experimental data up to 1980, and \nrecommended spreading rates of 0.12 measured by the velocity half-width and 0.13 for \nthe temperature spread measured by its half-width. These figures are frequently used as \nthe reference data with which to optimise models (Yan and Holmstedt [7], Hossain and \nRodi [2]). Spread rates are measured in terms of the half width where the half-width in \neach case is defined to be that distance from the centre where the value (velocity or \ntemperature here) is half of its centreline value. Values ranging from 0.08 to 0.147 for \nvelocity spread and from 0.098 to 0.14 for the temperature spread were reported by Chen \nand Rodi [4]. More recent experiments have supported these values. Ramaprian and \nChandrasekhara [12] found a velocity spread of 0.11 and temperature spread of 0.13. \nSangras et al. [13] found even lower values.  \nThe velocity centreline values can be clearly evaluated for the planar case, since the \nvelocity centreline asymptotes to a constant value away from the source. Different \nauthors give different values again. For this configuration Chen and Rodi [4] would have \ngiven a maximum velocity of 0.31m\/s, Ramprian and Chandrasekhara [12] of 0.34m\/s, \nand Rouse [20] of 0.29m\/s. \nThe cross-stream profile of any characteristic variable (such as velocity or \ntemperature) has been empirically shown to approximate a Gaussian (normal) \ndistribution. Empirical constants and terms can be altered to suit the experimental data as \nwill be shown. \n \n    17\n                                               RESULTS \n \nPreliminary solutions were obtained to quantify grid dependence, and secondly to \nconfirm that the plume spread rates were genuinely evaluated in the self-similar region. \n  \nGrid independence was demonstrated using the ASMGGDH model on four grids, as \nshown in Table 1. This shows a tendency for a very slight increase in spread rates with \ngrid refinement. The change is sufficiently small to be considered grid independent. Grid \nindependence was also shown for the SGDH model, and the other models were assumed \nto be grid independent from these. Based on these comparisons grid A was used for \nmodel evaluation in the following sections. \n \nThe self-similarity and Gaussian distributions of the characteristic profiles are shown \nin Figures 1 and 2. The overlapping curves demonstrate that the plume has adopted a self-\nsimilar profile in this region. The curves are normalised in the vertical axis to the \ncentreline velocities and in the horizontal axis with the distance to the half-centreline \nvelocity. \n \nIt is important that the spreading rate is determined in the self-similar region. Table 2 \npresents results from the models with \u03b53C , the coefficient of the flux Richardson number, \nfixed at 0.6, as recommended by Yan and Holmstedt [7], whose initial work this follows. \nThe spread rates were evaluated using the half-width, both at a vertical distance between \n1m and 2m from the source, representing the self-similar region as demonstrated \n    18\npreviously, and between the source (0m) and 2m from the source. As the results \ndemonstrate, misleading conclusions can be drawn if the inappropriately specified spread \nrate is utilised. Spread rates are evaluated in the self-similar region throughout the \nremainder of this paper. \n \nTable 3 demonstrates that the SGDH model shows no or little improvement on the \nORIGINAL model. This is because the value of the SGDH term is small as can be seen in \nFigure 3. This is contrary to results given by Hossain and Rodi [2] who show the SGDH \nto be a great improvement on the ORIGINAL model. This could be due to the method of \nevaluation of spread rates as demonstrated in Table 2. If the spread rates are measured \nfrom the source, then there is the appearance of good improvement. The effect of the \nSGDH model is for the plume to widen rapidly at the source before settling into the self-\nsimilar region, where the spread rate is not altered by the SGDH model as compared to \nthe ORIGINAL model.  \nThe fR  term, when in conjunction with the SGDH model, has previously been found \nto have little effect (Markatos et al. [6], Bos et al. [16]). This work is in agreement with \nthese findings. It makes sense that the fR  term has little effect with the SGDH model \nsince GB is almost negligible. Markatos [6] suggests removing the G term from the \n\u03b5 equation altogether. This is equivalent to letting \u03b53C  equal unity. It would still make \nlittle difference to the SGDH model, but the GGDH and ASM would be affected it as \nshown below.  \n \n    19\nIt is clear from the results shown in Table 2 that the GGDH and ASMGGDH models \ngave the most significant increases in spread rates. Conversely, the SGDH, ASM, and \nASMSGDH showed little increase on ORIGINAL (the unmodified k-\u03b5 model), indicating \nthe significance of the GGDH model assumption. \nFigure 4 shows the relative magnitude of the production terms in the k-equation for \nthe ASMGGDH model. It can be seen that the overall production is increased by about \n25%, over half of which is generated by the PASM term. The magnitude of the PASM term \nwas found to be similar in the ASM model even though there is no comparable increase \nin the spread rates. This difference is attributed to the controlling effect of the buoyancy \nproduction term in the \u03b5-equation and the fR  multiplier. \n \nThe effect of the flux Richardson term, fR , is to decrease the turbulent dissipation \nrate with increasing buoyancy, resulting in an overall increase in the net turbulence \nproduction, and hence increase the spread rate. In the ASM model the fR  term is 0 by \ndefinition (since G is not modelled), whereas in the ASMGGDH the value is \napproximately 0.15. This implies that overall, the fR  term in the \u03b5-equation has \nconsiderably more direct effect than the production terms in both the k and \u03b5 equations. \n \nThe results from the GGDH model were also significantly affected by the fR  term. \nTable 4 shows the variation of spread rates of the GGDH and the ASMGGDH models \nwith \u03b53C  varying.  \n    20\nWhen \u03b53C  is 0.7 the two models give equivalent results. The PASM term in the \nASMGGDH model can be considered to be a damping function on the fR  term in the \nGGDH model around this value. This makes sense since adding the PASM term into the \nfR  term decreases the value of the fR  term. \n \nTable 5 gives the centreline velocities for the ASMGGDH and GGDH models, again \nwith \u03b53C  varying. There is little difference between the two models and both models \npredict these values qualitatively correctly. i.e. the greater the spread rate, the less the \nvelocity, keeping the buoyancy flux constant at all distances from the source. The models \nare equivalent for the spreads and the maximum velocity with \u03b53C  = 0.7. These fit Chen \nand Rodi\u2019s [4] proposed values well. \n \nWhilst the ASMGGDH gives no advantage over the GGDH in this simulation, it \ndoes not increase the computing time by any significant margin and may offer benefits \nfor other flows. The ASM can be used in the momentum equations also, although Yan \nand Holmstedt [7] found this unstable in the simulation of buoyant fire plumes. \n \n \n    21\n                                     CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe results from the present work have confirmed that for a plane plume the SGDH \nmodel makes very little difference to the spread rates in comparison to the ORIGINAL \nmodel, although the plume does expand more rapidly in the near field of the source \nbefore the self-similar region. \nThe primary positive conclusion drawn from this work is that the GGDH and \nASMGGDH models in conjunction with the fR  term give significantly improved results \nover the ORIGINAL and also the SGDH model, and that the fR  term is a necessary \nfactor for this improvement. Furthermore, that greatest contribution to this improvement \ncan be attributed to the use of the GGDH to model the scalar fluxes in the buoyancy \nproduction term combined with the fR  term. The ASM model has a beneficial effect in \nconjunction with the GGDH and fR  but does not offer any significant improvement \nwhen used by itself. Rodi [3] recommends not using the fR  term for vertical shear flows. \nHowever, in combination with the above models it has been found to be very important, \nto the extent that without it the GGDH and ASMGGDH models would show very little \nimprovement. \nChow and Mok [21] investigated a number of buoyancy models including the \nASMGGDH model in fire simulations. They found it offered no significant improvement \nupon the SGDH model. This is in agreement with these results since they did not \nincorporate the flux Richardson number.  \n    22\nOptimal values for \u03b53C  can be given for each model depending on which \nexperimental data is used, and 0.7 is found for the GGDH and ASMGGDH using the data \nof Chen and Rodi [4]. However, using the more recent data, for example [13], then the \nORIGINAL and SGDH models give reasonably accurate results, suggesting that the use \nof the fR  term with the GGDH and ASM models is not necessary to improve the spread \nrates. Consistent experimental data is needed to truly optimise relevant coefficients. \n \n                            \n    23\n                              APPENDIX 1 \n \nDerivation of the k-equation with buoyancy terms.

The \ntime derivative, the convection and the diffusion of k. The next term is modelled by the \ndissipation rate, \u03b5. The pressure term and the triple correlation are modelled and added to \nthe regular diffusion term to make the turbulent diffusion term. The final terms are the \nproduction due to shear, P, and the production due to buoyancy, G, respectively.  \n \nUse has been made of 0\u2248\u2202\n\u2032\u2202\nj\nj\nx\nu\n. \n \n \n \n    26\n                                           REFERENCES \n1.
