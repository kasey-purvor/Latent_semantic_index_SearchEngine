Changes in \ntemperature were found to give larger sensor responses, whereas the application of filters \nled to quantitative and qualitative changes in sensor responses due to a change in mass \nflow which was also affected by the sampling method. Static sampling provided more \nstable flows across replicates. Variation was investigated for CPs and MOSFET\/MOS \ne-noses that gave different responses over time and across replicates. These\nmethodological factors cause a lack of stability and reproducibility, demonstrating the \npitfalls of e-nose technology and therefore limit their utility for discriminating between \nsamples.\nKeywords: Electronic nose, temperature effect, headspace, filter, sampling method\nManuscript\nPage 8 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n2\n1. Introduction\nFor more than 20 years, so-called electronic noses (e-noses) have been widely applied \nfor headspace- and trace gas analysis from solid-, liquid- and gaseous samples. During \nthis time, different sensing methods have been developed but the e-nose principle \nremained the same [1-5]. Generally, e-noses consist of an odour delivery system, an \narray of sensors, a data acquisition- and a data analysis unit. In all types of e-nose, the \nsensor array exploits the conversion of changes in electrical-, thermal-, mass- or optical \nproperties into an analysable signal [6]. As for human noses, sensors show an \noverlapping specificity and therefore provide a non-quantitative sensor response, a \nso-called fingerprint, rather than a specific qualitative or quantitative answer. The lack \nof specificity is due to the fact that sensors react with functional groups and structures of \nanalytes rather than specifically with the molecule itself [7, 8]. Sensor responses are \nthen analysed using multivariate data analysis techniques in order to classify or\ndiscriminate a group of samples. But data analysis methods are complicated by the fact \nthat there are multiple causes of variation \u2013biological differences between samples or\ndifferences arising from the analysis itself (methodological variation). Methodological\nvariation, including sensor drifts, may lead to unclear or contradictory results because \nthe lack of repeatability or \u201cdisturbance\u201d can be expressed as variation which may \nobscure biological variation. Hence the elimination of methodological variation is one \nof the biggest challenges associated with e-nose technology [9]. In this study, \nmethodological influences associated with headspace analysis from liquids were\ninvestigated using two typical but different types of electronic nose systems; two \nportable conducting polymer sensor based e-noses (CPs) and two non-portable \nMOSFET\/ MOS based e-noses. For each type, devices were compared. \nPage 9 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3\nTemperature is the main influencing factor in generating and analysing headspace \nfrom liquids. As predicted by Henry\u2019s law, temperature affects the vaporisation of \nmolecules. Even minor increases in temperature lead to a higher concentration of \nmolecules in the gas phase. For the same reason, it also affects relative humidity. \nVariation of e-nose responses due to these parameters has been reported by various \nauthors [10-13]. CP e-noses are particularly sensitive to humidity [14]. The electrical \nconductivity for CP e-noses is increased especially for electrophobic and nucleophilic \nsubstances [15]. Both monomer structure and inter-chain behaviour change [16] due to \nwater vapour adsorption on the sensor surface. Filters have been applied to prevent \nsensor surface damage due to moisture and, in case of infectious material, to prevent \ncontamination [17, 18].\nMemory effects were also reported for CPs, in particular with gaseous compounds \nwhich have a strong proton affinity. The interaction with monomers leads to a further \nsensitivity loss [19]. Unlike MOSFET\/ MOS e-noses, conducting polymer-based \ne-noses were also reported to be almost resistant to poisoning and to have a higher \nselectivity in comparison to semiconductors [10, 11]. Furthermore, the growth process \nfor CP e-nose polymers is variable leading to different sensor arrays and responses [11, \n20].\nRegarding sampling methods, two different types can be distinguished: static and \ndynamic. The main difference between both methods is the constant pressure in the \nsampling apparatus for static sampling while pressure varies using dynamic sampling. \nChanges in pressure change the flow rate of molecules and therefore dynamic sampling \nmay give more inconsistent results.  Since dynamic sampling requires aerating the \nsample in order to compensate the pressure difference (e.g. lab air), sample dilution \noccurs leading to less sensitive analyses and temporal variability due to a non-\nequilibrium state (variation over replicates and runs) [12, 13, 21].\nPage 10 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\nFor MOSFET and MOS sensor-based e-noses, the effect of the temperature of the \nsensors and temperature of the samples analysed strongly influence the responses [22]. \nHowever, since sensors were strongly temperature and humidity controlled these \nparameters were not included in this study. MOSFET and MOS sensors were only \nconsidered in terms of repeatability over replicates and time. \nThe purpose of this study was to examine methodological variation during sampling \nprocess which may influence sensor responses and therefore sample classification and \ndiscrimination. For two CP e-noses, the variability in sensor response due to changes in \ntemperature, flow rates and experimental setups (usage of filters, different sampling \ntechniques) was assessed. Furthermore, the repeatability of analyses (replicates, over \ntime) was investigated for CP and MOS\/MOSFET e-noses. E-noses of the same type \nwere compared and variation during the sampling process was assessed using both types \nof e-nose. \nPage 11 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1 Apparatus \nTwo types of e-nose were used: conducting polymer- (CP) and metal oxide \nsemi-conducting field effect transistor\/ metal oxide semiconductor (MOSFET\/MOS)\ne-noses.\nThe Bloodhound ST114 and the ST214 CP e-noses (both Scensive Tech. Ltd.) \ncontained 14 conducting polymer sensors. The headspace is conveyed from the \nsampling container via a sampling port to the sensor array using an internal pump. The \nsensor array is not in a temperature and flow controlled environment. The time for \nadsorption and desorption during analyses was 20 seconds and seven replicates were \nanalysed unless otherwise stated. The total time per replicate was 55 seconds.\nTwo MOSFET\/ MOS e-noses (both NST 3220 Lab Emission Analyser; Applied \nSensors, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden) were assessed. The NST lab emission analyser houses ten \nMOSFET sensors (FE101A- FE105A, and FE101B- FE105B), twelve MOS sensors \n(MO101, MO102, MO104, MO110- MO118) and a humidity sensor. The principle of \nsampling is different from that of the ST214 e-noses. Samples are analysed from 30mL \nvials sealed with a septum and a lid which are placed in a rotating carousel and which \nmaintains a constant temperature (e.g. 25\u00b0C) for sample equilibration. A double needle \npenetrates the septum and pumps headspace to the sensor panel where reversible \nadsorption processes take place at 140\u00b0C (MOSFET) and 170\u00b0C (MOS). The second \nneedle maintains atmospheric pressure in the vial.\nPage 12 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\n2.2 Sampling methods\nThe effect of two types of sampling on the sensor response was investigated. \nDynamic sampling: Using this method, a liquid sample (5 mL) was pipetted into a \n30 mL vial and directly connected to the e-nose sampling port. When the e-nose started\nsniffing the headspace, a pressure difference ( p\uf044 ) was generated which was \ncompensated for by an incoming air stream (e.g. lab air). \nStatic sampling: An inflatable Nalophan bag (KALLE, UK) was attached via a \npolypropylene tube with a Swagelok fitting (Swagelok, England) to a Luer counterpart.\nThe Luer fitting could be directly connected to the e-nose. An internal pump delivered \nthe headspace to the sensor array and the bag gradually collapsed due to the volume \nreduction. Nalophan is available in sleeves of different diameters and its length may be \nvaried according to sample volume required. The material does not emit volatiles \ndetectable by e-nose (data not shown). To compare different sampling methods, the ratio \nof the liquid sample volume and headspace air volume was calculated \n(VSAMPLE\/ VHEADSPACE). \n2.3 Assessing the effect of temperature on e-nose response\nThe Bloodhound ST214 e-nose used in this study lacks a temperature controlled \nenvironment. In order to demonstrate the effect of temperature on the e-nose, reverse \nosmosis water (ROW) and bovine serum were analysed at different temperatures.\n0.5 mL of serum and ROW were pipetted into small Nalophan bags with a volume of \n0.7 L to give the ratio of sample- to bag volume of 7E-04. The serum was obtained from \none clinically healthy bovine animal (breed \u201cHolstein\u201d) held at the FLI (Friedrich \nLoeffler Institute, Jena, Germany). Both samples were incubated for 30 minutes and \nPage 13 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nanalysed at room temperature (21\u00b0C) and in a water bath (Type JB1, Grant Instruments, \nLtd.) at 30\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C, respectively; ambient air was also analysed as a standard.\n2.4 Mass flow and filters\nMass flows using different setups\nThe Bloodhound ST214 and ST114 e-noses used in this study lack a flow controller for \nadjusting mass flow. Hence, flow stability and rates were monitored under different \nsampling configurations using a mass flow sensor (Honeywell, AMW3300V). First, a \nLuer fitting was attached to the e-nose sampling port and to the mass flow sensor \nfollowed by a 0.45 \u00b5m pore sized Sartorious Minisart filter which was attached to the \nbag or sampling container. The mass flow rates for all combinations and both CPs were \nmeasured. The bag volume for static sampling was 0.7 L and the container volume for \ndynamic sampling was 30 mL. 1 mL of ROW or 5 mL of ROW were pipetted into the \nbag and the container as a standard solution, respectively. Flow rates were measured \nduring the adsorption phase, performed in duplicate and given as averaged values.\nTemperature was kept constant at 25\u00b0C.\nMass flow stability for static sampling\nThe mass flow over eight successive replicates was monitored using static sampling. \nThe experimental setup (calibration and analysis using two ST214) was similar to that \ndescribed above with an increase in bag volume to 0.8L while the volume of a 10ppm \n2-butanol standard solution was kept constant at 1mL (ratio: 1.25E-3). Time for \nadsorption was increased to 30 seconds. \nMass flows using different types of filter \nThe impact of two different filters, a 0.45 \u00b5m pore sized Sartorious Minisart filter and a \n0.20 \u00b5m Whatman Acrodisc LC13 filter on the analysis of a 2% (v\/v) 2-butanol solution \nwas investigated. The changes to signal intensity (quantitative changes) and signal \nPage 14 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\npattern (qualitative changes) of a CP e-nose (ST214) were studied. For comparison, \nROW was also analysed either with no filter or the 0.45 \u00b5m filter. Eight replicates per \nexperimental setup were taken. The temperature was kept constant at 25\u00b0C. \nSelected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) was also used to investigate \nquantitative and qualitative changes in samples after passage through a filter. SIFT-MS \nis a real-time mass spectrometry method that provides quantitative data on compounds \npresent. Full details are given in [23]. Duplicate sample bags containing 0.5 mL of \nbovine serum and filled with 0.7 L hydrocarbon-free air were analysed with and without \na 0.20\u03bcm PVDF filter (Whatman, Acrodisc LC13). The concentrations of key marker \ncompounds such as water, acetone, methanol and ammonia were measured.\n2.5 E-nose comparison and characterisation \nConducting polymer e-nose characterisation\nVariability of the two CPs from the same production batch (both ST214 e-noses \nmanufactured under the same conditions within the same period of time) across four \ntime points over a day was assessed using bovine serum sampled statically. Small bags \n(0.8 L) were used for each time point and device. The serum sample volume was 0.9 mL \nwhich leads to a corresponding sample to headspace volume ratio of 1.2E-3.\nThe temperature was maintained at 25\u00b0C. After incubating each bag for 15 mins at 25\u00b0C \nto establish an equilibrium, the bags were subsequently analysed (7 replicates) every \ntwo hours on four occasions beginning at 10:00 to assess the following factors:\n\uf0b7 Device (describing variance caused by the e-noses)\n\uf0b7 Time point (describing variance caused across time)\n\uf0b7 Size of bag (describing differences according to bag size)\nPage 15 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\n\uf0b7 Replicates (describing differences due to repetitive sampling across one \nanalysis)\nMOSFET\/ MOS e-nose characterisation\nIn order to characterise the MOSFET\/MOS e-noses, the variation caused by different \nsample volumes and position around the carousel was investigated. Twelve vials \ncontaining six different sample volumes (50 \u00b5L, 100 \u00b5L, 150 \u00b5L 200 \u00b5L, 250 \u00b5L and \n500 \u00b5L) of bovine serum were sampled twice to test reproducibility. After 15 minutes \nequilibration samples were analysed randomly with an air flow of 60 mL per minute. \nThe adsorption time was 30 seconds. \nThe two MOS\/MOSFET e-noses were also used to investigate differences between the \ndevices and across time to compare characteristics with the CP e-noses. 200 \u00b5L of \nbovine serum was pipetted into six vials per time point (sample volume to vial volume \nratio: 6.7E-3). Three vials were analysed randomly at four different time points starting \nat 10:30 in 2h intervals. The adsorption phase time was 30 seconds. Differences caused \nby devices, over time, and replicates were investigated. \n2.6 Statistical analysis\nIn order to determine the influence of a parameter on the sensor response (divergence, \nmaximum amplitude of signal in sample analysis) univariate data analysis techniques \nwere used. Linear regression and multifactor ANOVA were performed using the \nstatistical package SPSS (version 11.5, 2002). The level of significance for these \nanalyses was P\u22640.05 and the impact of each parameter on the result was given as \nt-value. For e-nose comparison, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was performed\nusing Matlab on the raw datasets and on auto-scaled as well as mean-centred data. \nPage 16 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\nAuto-scaling scales all values of a column of the data matrix by its standard deviation \nwhich eliminates different ranges or magnitudes of data. Mean-centring eliminates \nconstant offsets by subtracting the column mean from the single values.\n3. Results\n3.1 Influence of temperature \nMultifactor ANOVA and linear regression were performed on data obtained from the \nST214 e-nose. The influence of temperature on signal traces of ROW and bovine serum\nwas investigated. \nSensors 6 and 8 revealed significant differences between ROW and bovine serum\n(Figure 1). Serum samples led to more positive values in comparison to ROW; similar \ntendencies were observed for the other sensors but were not statistically significant. \nThese sensors were also influenced by temperature, hence a combination of both \nfactors affected the sensor signals. Sensors 10 and 11 were neither influenced by the \nsubstance nor by temperature. The remaining sensors were significantly influenced by \ntemperature. An increase in temperature led to more negative values (negative t-factor) \nso to a more negative change in divergence. Figure 1 illustrates the increase in signal \nintensity with increasing temperature. Ambient air data are also shown.\n[INSERT figure 1 about here]\n3.2 Mass flow and filters\nMass flows using different setups\nPage 17 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\nThe mass flow rates under different experimental conditions were 180 and 200mL\/min \nrespectively when the Luer fitting, flow sensor and the bag fitting were attached to both \ne-noses (ST114, ST214). The flow rates for static sampling were 98% (ST114) and 97%\n(ST214) of the original mass flows rates, while for dynamic sampling, rates decreased to \n66% for both devices. For dynamic sampling, during the adsorption phase, mass flow \nvaried due to the bubbling effect. The addition of the 0.45\u00b5m filter led to a significant \ndrop in flow to 65% and 68% for ST114 and ST214 using static sampling and to 52% \nand 57% for dynamic sampling.\nMass flow stability  \nChanges in mass flow were observed testing different sampling methods and devices for \nboth CP e-noses when analysing eight replicates of a 10ppm butanol solution (ANOVA, \nP\u22640.05). Constant flow rates were found for replicates 2 to 5 for e-nose 1 (set as 100%) \nand e-nose 2 but the second e-nose had a 17% higher flow rate. For replicates 1, a minor \ndecrease in flow rates of 4% was found for both e-noses and approximately 72% of the \nheadspace volume was analysed (573 mL e-nose 1 and 576 mL for e-nose 2). Flow rates \ndecreased significantly by 15 and 13%, respectively. \nThe decrease in mass flow occurred with progressive collapse of the bag. \nMass flows using different types of filter \nComparing divergences obtained analysing the 2-butanol solution with no filter, a \n0.45\u00b5m (Sartorious) and a 0.20\u00b5m filter (Whatman), significant differences were found\nfor all sensors (ANOVA, P\u22640.001, raw data not shown). The highest sensor responses, \nexpressed as negative divergences, were seen when there was no filter (group 1, \nreplicates 1 to 8). Attaching the 0.45 \u00b5m filter, the values became less negative (group 2, \nreplicates 9 to 16); use of the 0.20 \u00b5m filter (group 3, replicates 17 to 24) led to lowest \nchanges (see figure 2).\nPage 18 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\n[INSERT figure 2 about here]\nQualitative changes in signal pattern with the use of filters were investigated by \ncomparing the results of the 2-butanol solution with those obtained analysing ROW \n(figure 3). Using no filter, both solutions could be distinguished while no discrimination \nwas found using the 0.45 \u00b5m filter. Furthermore, the biggest discrimination was found \nusing the 0.20 \u00b5m filter and the unfiltered butanol solution. Principle Component 1,\ncovering 99.67% of all variance, mainly represented changes due to filter application \nrather than differences between the solutions. \n[INSERT figure 3 about here]\nQuantitative data from SIFT-MS analyses of duplicate cattle serum headspace samples \nshowed changes in some key marker compounds. The concentration of water measured \nchanged from a mean of 5.15 % for unfiltered samples to a mean of 4.26% for filtered \n(0.20 \u00b5m Whatman filter) samples (reduction of 17%); ammonia from a mean of 771 \nparts-per-billion (ppb) for unfiltered and 547 ppb for filtered (reduction of 29%); \nmethanol from a mean of 424 ppb for unfiltered and 962 ppb filtered (increase of \n126%). Acetone remained unchanged, at a mean of 656 ppb unfiltered and 680 ppb \nunfiltered. Clearly, the addition of a filter changed the concentration of many volatile \ncompounds. \nPage 19 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\n3.3 E-nose comparison and characterisation \nConducting polymer e-nose characterisation\nSensor responses from all four time points obtained from similar CPs of the same type \nand manufacturer were analysed in Matlab using PCA. Principal Components 1 and 2 \ncovered 99.10% of all variance. A clear discrimination between both e-noses was found \nusing auto-scaled data. Without pre-treatment, data could not be interpreted.\nThe difference between the devices covered 84.03% of all variance, and 15.07% of all \nchanges were due to changed divergences over time using static sampling (see figure 4).\n[INSERT figure 4 about here]\nConsidering PCA plots, time points 1 and 3 as well as 2 and 4 were grouped together for \nCP e-nose 1. Similar results were found for e-nose 2 however, responses of time point 4 \nwere more scattered.\nSPSS analysis using linear regression and multifactor ANOVA (P\u22640.05) showed that the \ndevice, the time points and the replicates were potential factors influencing the result. \nThe factors device and time point had the biggest influence while factor replicates was \nalmost not statistically relevant, except for two sensors.\nConsidering the responses over time for each device separately, divergences changed \nthroughout the day for both e-noses (shown for one e-nose in figure 5). Sensor responses \nwere highest at time point 1, decreased at time point 2 increased and decreased again for \ntime points 3 and 4. Responses obtained at time points 1 and 3 as well as 2 and 4 were \nclosest, respectively. Results for the other e-nose showed a similar trend. This result \nconfirmed PCA findings.\nPage 20 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n14\n[INSERT figure 5 about here]\nFor almost all sensors and both devices the temporal variation appeared sinusoidal, and \nthere was a tendency for responses to decline across all time points and for both e-noses; \ndemonstrated using SPSS multifactor ANOVA (P \u22640.05)..\nMOSFET\/ MOS e-nose characterisation\nIt was found that the factor replicate had a statistically significant influence on some \nsensor responses only (P\u22640.05). A few MOSFET sensors (FE103A, 104A, 105A, 104B) \nshowed a significant difference between the first and the second reading of the same \nvial. Most of the sensors showed a similar tendency of a decrease from replicate 1 to \nreplicate 2 although these results were not significant. \nThe sample volume had no influence on the results within the volume range evaluated \n(50 to 500\u00b5L). \nAnalysing the averaged values across all time points and replicates for the two \nMOSFET\/ MOS e-noses, there was a significant difference between the two. Except for \nthe sensor FE104B, which was a MOSFET sensor, all other sensors demonstrated \nsignificantly different responses between the two devices. The first e-nose showed \nhigher responses for MOSFET and MOS sensors (see figure 6). \n[INSERT figure 6 about here]\nThe standard deviation from the base line for the first e-nose varied between 0.43 for the \nsensor MO111 (3.8% change in sensor response) and 35.22 for MO115 (16.4% change \nin sensor response). For the second e-nose, standard deviation was between 2.3 for the \nsensor MO112 and 19.0 for MO116 (54.0% change in sensor response). However, \nPage 21 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n15\nsensors with small responses varied up to 201%. The averaged standard deviation from \nthe baseline was 9.9 for the first e-nose and 7.8 for the second device.\nWith the first e-nose, most of the MOSFET-generated values showed significant \nvariation between the replicates using different vials, while samples analysed at \ndifferent time points led to almost no changes. In contrast, the MOS sensors showed \nalmost no changes between the replicates but data analysis indicated a significant \ndecline in sensor responses over time for most sensors (multifactor ANOVA, P\u22640.05). \nOnly two sensor responses increased across time (MO111, MO112). \nAnalysing the same factors for the second e-nose, it was found that while the responses \nfor all sensors were not affected by any variation in replicates, the traces of almost all \nMOS sensors were influenced by time. Generally, the responses decreased over the \ncourse of the day. In three cases the responses remained constant (MO101, MO102, \nMO104) and in another two cases the values increased across time (MO115, MO116). \nThe MOSFET sensors generally exhibited a decrease of signal intensity across time but \nthis tendency was only statistically significant in two cases (FE105A, FE103B).\n4. Discussion.\n4.1 The effect of temperature\nTemperature changes had a major effect on sensor response. Even the two sensors able \nto discriminate between ROW and serum samples were significantly influenced by \ntemperature. Changing temperature led to both qualitative and quantitative changes\nsince a higher temperature leads to a greater concentration of volatiles in the headspace, \nwhich will generate different sensor responses. Such large changes in response due to \nPage 22 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n16\ntemperature may mask the differences between samples, preventing discrimination or \nclassification using multivariate techniques. \nChanges in the physico-chemical properties of conducting polymers or their monomers \nwhen exposed to different temperatures have been described in literature. Impedance \nwas decreased with an increase in humidity and temperature [10-13]. The temperature \noptimum was found to be 25\u00b0C [7, 24].\nA temperature controller would add weight and bulk to the device. Some work has been \ncarried out to construct a flow cell for temperature- and flow controlled analysis. \nAttempts were made to optimise the positions of the sensors on a heating block and the \nincoming gas so that headspace reacted in the same way with optimised sensors [25, \n26]. With these changes in design, the most significant e-nose problems might be \nresolved to produce improved signal responses in terms of stability, reproducibility, \nresponse time and amplitude, all without losing e-nose portability.\n4.2. Mass flow and filters and stability\nResults of this study indicate that the previous assumption of an estimated mass flow \nrate of 200 ml\/min using similar CP noses is not valid since flow rates change \ndepending on sampling methods and filter usage. The ST114 had a flow rate of \n180 mL\/min and the ST214 of 200 and 235mL\/min, respectively. A drop of 75% \ncompared to the stable flow rates over replicates 2 to 5 was observed using dynamic \nsampling and the additional application of a 0.45 \u00b5m pore sized filter which was \npreviously used in other studies [27, 28]. Bubbling air through the liquid sample led to \nvariation and a decrease in pressure in the vial which was also found by others [29]. \nDilution of the headspace and a non-equilibrium state led to variation between replicates \nalso reported by others [30], while some authors obtained the best discrimination with \nPage 23 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n17\ndynamic sampling but better sensitivity using static sampling [6]. The filter was an \nadditional resistance in flow rate for CP e-noses. In contrast, static sampling provided \nstable mass flow rates and equilibrium states because of the collapse of a sealed bag. \nTherefore, static sampling can significantly improve e-nose responses by minimising \nvariation between and over replicates. In trace gas analysis (lower ppm to ppb), stability \nis crucial as even small changes may lead to non-discrimination.\nQualitative and quantitative changes in signals were found when filters were used. The \nchange was dependent on the pore size of the filters, which protect the conducting \npolymer sensing surface of the e-nose from being changed by a high extent of water \nvapour. Mass flow rates decreased with a decline in pore size. However removal of \nwater vapour will also remove other volatile compounds and leads to a change in \nheadspace composition. This was confirmed using CP e-noses combined with PCA data \nanalysis (clustering according to filter application) and analysing quantitative SIFT-MS\ndata. Since most biological samples contain water (e.g. blood\/serum, urine), filters have \nbeen widely used for protection of the sensors (0.45 \u00b5m PTFE, Whatman\/Hepavent) \n[26-29]. However, these results indicate that using a filter may not a valid approach \nsince discrimination between 2-butantol and ROW was not possible once a 0.45 \u00b5m \nfilter was introduced and 98% of all variation was due to different filter application. \nHeadspace was significantly changed. \nResults of SIFT-MS analysis showed qualitative and quantitative changes in sample \ncomposition with the addition of a filter. The claimed advantage of using a filter for \nsensor protection [21, 30] is highly questionable since sensor response patterns change \nwith the use of a filter showing changes in methanol or ammonia and therefore \ndiscrimination is made difficult.\nPage 24 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n18\n4.3 E-nose characterisation and comparison\nConducting polymer e-nose characterisation\nTemporal changes in sensor response have been reported elsewhere [12, 13]. The sine \nwave-like changes described here across the day are possibly due to semi-reversible \nchanges on the sensor surface. Since this effect was observed for both CP e-noses using \nstatic bag sampling and confirmed using multifactor ANOVA and PCA it seems to be a \nsystematic problem which is not associated with dilution of samples nor a non-\nequilibrium state. It appears to be the result of semi-reversible desorption. Certain \nmolecules might be desorbed before the software determines a new baseline (offset) for \nacquisition, meaning that in later analyses, responses cannot develop the same way since \nsome binding sites are still occupied. So the changes in comparison to the baseline are \ndifferent from the preceding analysis. Occupation of binding sites may come from water \nmolecules of ambient air interacting with dopants or where headspace molecules were \nnot desorbed properly. Purging with an inert gas such as nitrogen has been used by some \nauthors to improve desorption and repeatability [7, 31]. The reasons why responses in \nthis study were in the form of a sine wave, however, remain unclear. This may be \nevidence of memory effects which have been described by several authors [10, 19]. \nFurther analyses are necessary to elucidate the cause of this effect. A comparison of \nsensor responses of similar CP e-noses produced by the same manufacturer was not \npossible due to different flow rates (180 mL\/min to 235 ml\/min) and qualitatively \ndifferent responses, although the same substances were analysed under identical \nconditions (see section 2.5 and 3.3 CP e-nose comparison).\nPage 25 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n19\nMOSFET\/ MOS e-nose characterisation\nThe sensor response patterns obtained from two MOSFET\/ MOS e-noses were different \nwhen sampling the same headspaces. However, the variation was random and not \nsignificant; high standard deviation was found across various sample volumes (50 to \n500 \u03bcL) but not across vials in the carousel. This was also confirmed in the literature \n[32, 33]. Almost all MOSFET sensors of e-nose 1 were found to be replicate dependent \nand almost all MOS sensors varied over time. The fact that different values were \nobtained (independent to the sample volume) when vials were sampled twice contradicts \nthe findings of others that dual needle sampling was a reliable sampling method [34]. \nThe reason for this could be the simple fact that after sampling, the liquid had been \n\u201coutgassed\u201d and lost a proportion of its volatile compounds.\nSimilar to the CP e-noses, temporal changes in MOS sensors indicate an insufficient \ndesorption process; the new baseline being determined with molecules still attached to \nsensor surface resulting in a different response. \nComparison between e-nose devices\nComparing e-noses of the same type under different experimental setups, a lack of \ncomparability was a surprising and worrying observation in this study and points to\nimportant manufacturing and engineering inconsistencies. Lack of reproducibility of \nsensor responses was exacerbated by the sampling principle, which mainly affected the \nportable CP e-noses. \nDespite the fact CP e-nose and the MOSFET\/ MOS e-nose were not comparable due to \ndifferent sensing principles, there were changing sensor responses for both types of \ne-noses over time which were due to semi-reversible adsorption. Standardisation and \nimprovement of production methods towards reliable and comparable sensors is \nPage 26 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n20\nurgently required, particularly for conducting polymer devices but also for MOSFET\/ \nMOS sensors.\n5. Conclusions\n\uf0b7 Static sampling using the conducting polymer e-nose is better than dynamic \nsampling because of stable mass flow which leads to better repeatability.\n\uf0b7 Filters are not recommended as they quantitatively change the mass flow rate \nand qualitatively change the sensor pattern which may lead to non-\ndiscrimination.\n\uf0b7 Temperature and mass flow rate controlled sensor chambers could enhance the \nrepeatability of e-noses and therefore improve discrimination and classification \nusing multivariate data analyses. \n\uf0b7 Incomplete desorption from sensors affects both conducting polymers and MOS \nsensors. Longer purging with inert gases may solve this problem and lead to \nmore consistent responses over time. \n\uf0b7 Because of the sources of variation discussed in this paper, multivariate data \nanalysis techniques are only suitable for data obtained with stable e-nose \nsystems; otherwise methodological variation may mask biological differences \nbetween samples. To overcome this problem, some authors suggest an absolute \ncalibration for e-noses [3, 35] or a compensation at the data analysis level [9] but \nwe believe in improving methodology first, since the calibration or reference \npoints also shift but not necessarily in a linear or predictable way (due to \nchanges in temperature, humidity, sampling methodology and memory effects). \nImprovements in devices are advisable such as static sampling in a controlled \nambient environment, the introduction of controlled sensor chambers, and \nPage 27 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n21\nautomated purging. This should minimise methodological variation and enhance \nthe classification and discrimination of samples based on the biological variation \nwhich is present in all types of sample [36, 37]. Such improved and optimised \ne-noses may then be capable of fulfilling the considerable promise of this \ntechnology.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n(DEFRA) for funding this project and the Institute of Molecular Pathogenesis at the \n\u2018Friedrich\u2013Loeffler\u2013Institut\u2019 (FLI, Jena, Germany) for providing bovine serum samples. \nPage 28 of 32\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n22\nReferences\n[1] P.
