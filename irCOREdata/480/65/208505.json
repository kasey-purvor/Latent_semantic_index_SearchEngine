Introduction \nMany environmentalists are critical towards trade liberalisation. In their view, free trade \nis responsible for many aspects of environmental degradation and for the failure of pol-\nicy makers to adequately protect the environment. This critique cannot leave uncon-\ncerned those who both care for the environment and believe in a liberal world trading \norder. This article attempts to demonstrate that while there is indeed reason for being \nconcerned about the environmental consequences of free trade, environmental protec-\ntion and trade liberalisation need not clash with each other. It provides some suggestions \non how trade and environmental protection can be reconciled in future rounds of trade \nnegotiations. \nThe criticism of environmental activists and ecologically oriented academics towards \ntrade liberalisation can be summarised in three points (see, for example, Greenpeace \n1997, WWF et al. 1998, WWF 1999, FoE 1999a, Morris 1990, Daly 1993, Lang and \nHines 1993, McGinn 1998): \n\u2022 The liberalisation of trade is likely to exacerbate the existing high levels of environ-\nmental degradation. \n\u2022 Countries will lower their environmental standards in order to attract foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) into \u2018pollution havens\u2019 if trade liberalisation allows them to export \ntheir goods into countries with high environmental standards. \n\u2022 The dispute settlement system of the WTO favours trade interests over environmental \nprotection. \nIn this paper, I will critically assess what theory and empirical evidence can tell us with \nrespect to these important topics. \n \n \n5 \n2. Environmental degradation due to trade liberalisation \nFrom an outside perspective, it might seem at times as if economists and free trade pro-\nponents unreservedly subscribed to the view that trade liberalisation is always in har-\nmony with the environment. Such a perspective would be fundamentally wrong, how-\never. First, there is a consensus among economists that trade liberalisation might harm \nthe environment if the environment is not optimally managed. If externalities are not \ninternalised, then free trade can make the already inefficient allocation of resources even \nmore inefficient. In these circumstances, trade liberalisation can be like a fresh breeze of \nwind on a house that is already set on fire. Even the WTO (1997b, p. 1) readily admits \nthat for the benefits of trade liberalisation to be realised and \u2018for trade-induced growth to \nbe sustainable, appropriate environmental policies determined at the national level need \nto be put in place\u2019. What is more, if an economy that is liberalising its trade regime suf-\nfers from distortions to a great extent, an increase in trade can very well harm the coun-\ntry\u2019s overall welfare, not just its environmental quality (Markandya 1994, p. 10). \nSecond, there exist both theoretical economic models and empirical evidence sug-\ngesting that trade liberalisation might harm the environment even if resources are effi-\nciently allocated and the environment is optimally managed. At the most fundamental \nlevel, it is uncontested that if a country specialises in the production of pollution-\nintensive goods after an opening up towards trade, its emissions will rise and its envi-\nronment will suffer. On the other hand, the other countries will become cleaner and their \nenvironment will benefit as they can satisfy their demand for pollution-intensive goods \nvia increased imports (Rauscher 1991, p. 20f.), so that the overall amount of pollution \nneed not increase. In other models, however, a global increase in pollution follows from \ntrade liberalisation. In the two regions model of Copeland and Taylor (1994), for exam-\nple, worldwide pollution increases even though emissions in the \u2018North\u2019 decrease be-\n6 \ncause \u2018Southern\u2019 emissions increase even more. Behind this result stands the assump-\ntion \u2014 widely shared among economists \u2014 that the environment is a normal good. This \nmeans that demand for environmental protection increases with income growth. It fol-\nlows that trade liberalisation which shifts the production of pollution-intensive goods \ntowards the low-income, high-polluting South increases global pollution as the decrease \nin Northern emissions is insufficient at the margin to compensate for the increase in \nSouthern emissions.1 \nThird, the negative worldwide environmental effects of trade liberalisation described \nabove become exacerbated if one of two conditions hold: first pollution is not local, but \ntransboundary or global in nature and second, the environment is not optimally man-\naged. In the first case, incentives to internalise the environmental externality are low, the \nmost conspicuous example being greenhouse gases. In the second case, trade liberalisa-\ntion can lead to an export of the resource misallocation to other countries and thereby to \na deterioration in environmental quality. An example for this is Chichilnisky\u2019s (1994) \ninfluential two regions model in which ill defined property rights over natural resources \nin the South lead to an overproduction of environmentally intensive goods. The South \nhas a comparative advantage in the production of this good \u2014 an advantage that is only \napparent, however. Trade liberalisation \u2018makes things worse, in the sense that the over-\nuse of the resource increases as the South moves from autarky to trade\u2019 (ibid., p. 859). A \nfinal aspect of how trade liberalisation can harm the environment is via the increase in \ntransportation. OECD (1997b) estimates that international transport is bound to increase \nby four to five per cent due to the increase in trade in the wake of the Uruguay Round. \nThat trade liberalisation can lead to worldwide environmental degradation is not an \nartefact of theoretical economic models. The empirical study by Cole, Rayner and Bates \n(1998) on the environmental effects of the Uruguay Round demonstrates that global \n7 \nemissions of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, suspended particulate \nmatter and carbon dioxide are likely to have increased. Their study mirrors the finding \nfrom theoretical models that emission increases in the developing South overcompen-\nsate for possible emission decreases in the developed North. What the study demon-\nstrates as well, however, is that the monetary value of the increased environmental dam-\nage is likely to be drastically lower than the welfare gain due to the other beneficial ef-\nfects of trade liberalisation. This result echoes the theoretical finding of Anderson \n(1992, p. 29) that overall welfare is unambiguously higher with trade if environmental \npolicy is not too far from its optimum \u2018despite the fact that the environment is more pol-\nluted\u2019. \nTo sum up, both theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence show that trade liber-\nalisation can lead to a global increase in resource depletion and to a global increase in \nenvironmental pollution. These effects are more likely to occur and are more likely to be \nstronger if property rights over resources are ill defined and if the environment is not \noptimally managed. There is ample evidence that, especially in many developing, but \nalso in developed countries, environmental management is non-optimal and property \nrights over natural resources are ill defined (see, for example, World Bank 1992). As \nconcerns the so-called global commons (climate, biodiversity etc.), property rights are \npractically non-existent and open access prevails leading to excessive resource depletion \nand pollution. The first concern of environmentalists is therefore well supported by \ntheoretical models and empirical evidence: trade liberalisation can indeed exacerbate the \nexisting high levels of environmental degradation. \nThis finding does not imply that overall welfare must fall if environmental degrada-\ntion increases. Indeed, as argued above, overall welfare can well increase if environ-\nmental management and resource depletion are not too far from their optimum. Two \n8 \nimportant observations follow: First, because trade liberalisation can lead to both overall \nwelfare improvements and a deterioration of environmental quality, a fundamental clash \ncan arise between free trade proponents and environmentalists. While the former can \nrefer to the overall increase in welfare in justification for their calls for trade liberalisa-\ntion, the environmentalists are likely to refer to increased resource depletion and envi-\nronmental degradation in justification for their concern about or opposition to trade lib-\neralisation. This clash is often not clearly recognised and it is not easily ameliorated. \nSecond, the increase in environmental degradation could in principle overcompensate \nany other beneficial effect of trade liberalisation. In other words, a situation in which \nenvironmental degradation increases so much that overall welfare decreases cannot be \nruled out per se. It is largely an empirical matter and would call for a careful assessment \nof the environmental consequences of trade liberalisation. \n \n \n3. Pollution havens: Do developing countries lower their environmental standards to \nattract foreign investment? \nThe second fear that environmentalists share is that countries supposedly have an incen-\ntive to artificially lower their environmental standards in order to attract FDI from high-\nstandard countries into their so-called \u2018pollution havens\u2019. Trade liberalisation comes \ninto play in so far as a freer trade regime allows the exportation of goods into the coun-\ntries with the higher standards. From the environmentalists\u2019 perspective this is detrimen-\ntal for two reasons. First, the environment in the pollution havens deteriorates substan-\ntially. Second comes a \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on environmental regulation such that countries \nfear to raise standards because of the threat of capital outflow that higher standards \nmight induce. Worse still, capital outflows might actually put downward pressure on \n9 \nexisting environmental standards of the source countries: countries compete with each \nother in a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 with respect to environmental standards in order to attract \nor keep capital. In the words of Daly (1993, p. 26f.): \u2018...unrestricted trade imposes lower \nstandards\u2019. \nThere are two basic strands of economic theory that can give rise to results similar to \nthe ones just described. For one strand, Oates and Schwab (1988) can serve as the prime \nmodel. If capital is internationally mobile and if countries want to acquire capital in or-\nder to gain capital tax revenue, then countries have an incentive to set their environ-\nmental standards below the optimal level in order to attract migratory capital. This result \nmirrors in the field of environmental standards a more general and much older finding \nfrom the literature on international tax competition. Similarly, pollution havens can arise \nif some countries fail to internalise all environmental externalities because the environ-\nmental pollution in question is transboundary, because policy makers are biased against \nenvironmental concerns or because of political-institutional failures in low standards \ncountries (Neumayer 2000). \nFor the other strand of economic theory, Barrett (1994) is presumably the best known \nmodel. He shows that if international markets are imperfectly competitive, then coun-\ntries can have an incentive to lower their environmental standards, which allows the \nhome country\u2019s industry to expand its output and to shift some of the profits from inter-\nnational markets away from its foreign country\u2019s competitors.2 Since all countries have \nthis incentive, environmental standards are set inefficiently low worldwide. This result \nmirrors the more general and much older finding from the literature on research and \ndevelopment as well as export subsidies as a means to reap profits from international \nimperfectly competitive markets. Indeed, because lower environmental standards also \nhurt a country because of an increase in domestic pollution, they are only second best to \n10 \nsubsidies. But if R&D or export subsidies become incriminated by international trade \nagreements like the WTO, then to lower environmental standards can become the best \ninstrument available. \nThe empirical evidence does not support the hypothesis that countries lower their en-\nvironmental standards and industries migrate towards low standard countries, however. \nPractically all studies agree that apart from some specific cases there is no general de-\ntectable evidence that pollution havens are a significant phenomenon (see, for example, \nLeonard 1988; Tobey 1990; Jaffe, Peterson and Stavins 1995; OECD 1997a; Zarsky \n1999). While it is true that pollution intensity as a share of total manufacturing output \nhas increased in the developing world, whereas it has decreased in developed countries \n(see Lucas, Wheeler and Hettige 1992 and Mani and Wheeler 1997), this trend cannot \nbe attributed to pollution havens as the consumption of pollution intensive goods in the \ndeveloped world has decreased hand in hand so that the \u2018consumption\/production ratios \nfor dirty-sector products in the developing world have remained close to unity\u2019 (Mani \nand Wheeler 1997, p. 20). There are manifold reasons why transnational corporations do \nnot migrate towards countries with low environmental standards. These reasons range \nfrom the fear of liability in case of accidents, risk to a multinational corporation\u2019s repu-\ntation, consumer demands for environmentally friendly production to the costs of un-\nbundling technology and the anticipation of future more stringent environmental regula-\ntion in the host country (Neumayer 2000). \nThe reader should note two important caveats, however. The first caveat is that most \nempirical studies have so far looked at whether pollution prevention expenditures have \nprompted manufacturing industries to move to other locations with laxer environmental \nprotection standards. Much less attention has been given to an examination of whether \nnatural resource exploiting industries, from forest logging companies to open cast min-\n11 \ning, have relocated to places with less strict standards or have successfully used the \nthreat of re-location to knock down the imposition of stricter standards.3 More attention \nseems warranted here for mainly two reasons: first, natural resource and environmental \nprotection policies can lead to substantial costs for resource exploiting industries, thus \nstrengthening the incentives for re-location. For example, the costs for logging compa-\nnies are significantly different depending on whether or not they are required to use a \nforest sustainably. Second, natural resource exploitation can have tremendous environ-\nmental consequences if adequate environmental standards are not in place. For example, \nopen cast mining can lead to substantial pollution problems and disturbance of natural \neco-systems if standards for pollution containment and re-cultivation are not existent or \nare not enforced. \nThe second caveat to keep in mind is that environmental protection expenditures \nhave been relatively small so far as a share of overall costs. Up to a certain threshold, \nthese costs can increase without causing any major re-location. If these were to rise be-\nyond a certain threshold, however, cost incentives for re-location could become domi-\nnant. That is, the decision to re-locate could be non-linear in costs, which would be real-\nistic for sectors of imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale (for an eco-\nnomic model with these characteristics, see Markusen, Morey and Olewiler 1995). \n \n \n4. WTO dispute settlement: trade above the environment? \nThe third critique of the environmentalists is that trade always supersedes environmental \ninterests in the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system \u2013 as it did before in the GATT. As \nRetallack (1997) has put it: \u2018[I]n every case brought before it to date, the WTO has ruled \nin favour of corporate interest, striking down national and sub-national legislation pro-\n12 \ntecting the environment and public health at every turn.\u2019 In some sense, this is the envi-\nronmentalists\u2019 major critique against the WTO. Because, according to their perspective, \ntrade liberalisation leads to more environmental degradation, sovereign nation states \nshould at least have the right to impose stringent regulation to mitigate these environ-\nmentally detrimental effects \u2014 even if it interferes with trade interests. Indeed, because \ntrade liberalisation induces countries to lower their environmental standards to keep \nexisting or attract new capital, judged from the environmentalists\u2019 view stringent regula-\ntion is only possible if it restricts trade. It is therefore worthwhile to take a closer look at \nthe most important disputes where countries justified policies with one of the environ-\nmental exceptions in Article XX of the GATT, whereas other GATT or WTO members \nregarded those policies as violating their trade rights and therefore brought them before \na panel to decide. It is important to distinguish between measures, which aim at the pro-\ntection of the domestic environment, and measures, which aim at the protection of the \nenvironment outside a country\u2019s jurisdiction. However, it will also be important to look \nat the European Union import ban of beef from hormone treated cattle. This ban was not \njustified under one of the exceptions in Article XX of the GATT, but under human \nhealth protection provisions of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phyto-\nsanitary Measures (SPS Agreement), which forms part of the WTO system. \n \n4.1 Measures aimed at domestic environmental protection \nAs concerns trade restrictions, which aim at the protection of the domestic environment, \nthere have been four major decisions so far. All of them ended with the dispute panel (or \nthe appellate body, respectively) ruling that the trade restriction was, partially at least, in \nnon-conformity with GATT\/WTO rules. However, in every decision each dispute panel \nhas stressed that it had not decided against the protection of the domestic environment, \n13 \nbut merely against the intended or unintended effects of domestic regulation on imports \nfrom trading partners. In all cases, the panel has shown ways on how to protect the do-\nmestic environment without interfering with the trade rights of foreign countries. Let us \nhave a closer look at these dispute settlement decisions. \nIn November 1987 a panel decided on Canada\u2019s export prohibitions of unprocessed \nsalmon and herring (GATT 1987). Canada argued that these were necessary to protect \nits fish stocks that it said were under threat of depletion. The panel ruled that Canada \nhad violated its GATT obligations and demanded that Canada brings its measures into \nconformity with the GATT. It is important to note, however, that the panel did not ques-\ntion Canada\u2019s fundamental right to put policies in place that protect its fish stocks. It \nmerely ruled against Canada because it found that the export prohibitions were not \u2018pri-\nmarily aimed at the conservation of an exhaustible natural resource to be considered as \n\u201crelating to\u201c conservation with the meaning of Article XX(g)\u2019 of the GATT (ibid., para. \n4.6), which excepts measures \u2018relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural re-\nsources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic \nproduction or consumption\u2019. First, Canada did not prohibit the export of processed \nsalmon and herring, thus not generally limiting the exploitation of its fish stocks. Sec-\nond, Canada did not restrict access of its domestic producers to its unprocessed fish, \nthus effectively discriminating against foreign processors and privileging domestic ones \n(ibid., para 4.7). It is therefore most doubtful that Canada\u2019s export prohibitions of un-\nprocessed salmon and herring were only motivated by genuine concern about the protec-\ntion of these fish stocks. Because restrictions only applied to foreign producers, not to \ndomestic ones, there is some reason for suspecting that the regulation served to disguise \nprotectionist intentions. At the very least, one can say that Canada tried to protect its \nsalmon and herring stocks entirely at the expense of foreign producers. The dispute \n14 \npanel objected to this, but it did not rule against a regulation, which would protect the \nfish stocks more generally and would affect domestic and foreign producers alike. \nIn October 1990 a panel ruled against Thailand\u2019s restrictions on the importation of \nforeign cigarettes and its higher taxes on imported as opposed to domestically produced \ncigarettes (GATT 1990). Thailand had justified its policies with health protection. The \npanel ruled that because smoking constitutes a serious risk to human health \u2018measures \ndesigned to reduce the consumption of cigarettes fell within the scope of Article XX(b)\u2019 \n(ibid., para. 73), which excepts measures that are \u2018necessary to protect human, animal or \nplant life or health\u2019. The panel stated \u2018that this provision clearly allowed contracting \nparties to give priority to human health over trade liberalization\u2019 (ibid.). In order \u2018for a \nmeasure to be covered by Article XX(b) it had to be \u201cnecessary\u201c\u2019 to protect human life \nor health, however (ibid.). It went on in interpreting \u2018necessary\u2019 in the sense that \u2018there \nwere no alternative measure consistent with the General Agreement, or less inconsistent \nwith it, which Thailand could reasonably be expected to employ to achieve its health \npolicy objectives\u2019 (ibid., para. 75). The panel suggested a whole range of possible re-\nstrictions on the sale and purchase of cigarettes that Thailand might have employed \nwithout violating the rights of foreign cigarette producers. In the end, it ruled against \nThailand because its measure treated foreign cigarettes less favourably than domestic \nones without this trade discrimination being necessary to achieve its health objectives. \nIn September 1994, a panel decided on several United States measures on automo-\nbiles: a luxury tax on cars sold for over $30,000, a gas guzzler tax, which applied to \nautomobiles in general, and the so-called Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) \nregulation (GATT 1994). The panel found the two taxes to be consistent, but the CAFE \nregulation to be inconsistent with GATT regulations. This measure required the average \nfuel economy per fleet of automobiles for cars manufactured in the United States or sold \n15 \nby any importer not to exceed 27.5 miles per gallon. The panel did not find the fuel \neconomy regulation as such to be inconsistent with GATT. It merely objected against a \nprovision within the regulation, which required companies that both manufacture cars \ndomestically and import cars from abroad to exceed this fuel economy minimum sepa-\nrately for both the domestically manufactured and the imported cars. \nIn April 1996, an appellate body overruled an earlier panel report concerning US \nregulation of fuels and fuel additives (WTO 1996b). The regulation was quite compli-\ncated, but in essence required refiners to supply cleaner fuels and fuel additives relative \nto 1990 baseline standards. However, whereas US refiners were allowed to invoke their \nindividual 1990 baselines, foreign refiners in effect where faced with statutory baselines \nreflecting average 1990 US gasoline quality (ibid., pp. 4-6). The appellate body came to \nthe conclusion that the baseline establishment rules fell within the terms of Article \nXX(g), thus effectively ruling that stricter regulations on the pollution impact of fuels \nand fuel additives are in accordance with GATT (ibid., pp. 13-21). It went on analysing \nwhether it was also covered by the chapeau of Article XX which states that measures \nthat fall under one of the environmental exceptions must not be \u2018applied in a manner \nwhich would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between \ncountries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international \ntrade\u2019. It ruled that the US regulation violated this requirement stating that the US could \nhave made individual baselines available to foreign refiners as well, thus avoiding dis-\ncrimination against them (ibid., p. 25). It was not convinced by the US objection that \nindividual baselines for foreign refiners would have generated insurmountable adminis-\ntrative problems saying that the US had failed to engage in serious efforts to achieve \ncooperative agreements with the home countries of foreign refiners to reduce these \ncosts. As with the decision on Canada\u2019s export prohibition of unprocessed salmon an \n16 \nherring, the appellate body on US regulation of fuels and fuel additives clearly did not \nrule against the rights of the US to impose regulation in order to make cleaner fuels and \nfuel additives compulsory. It merely demanded that foreign and domestic suppliers of \nthese fuels and fuel additives were treated on equal terms in allowing individual 1990 \nbaseline standards. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has now agreed \nto evaluate foreign refiners on their individual baselines for minimum clean air stan-\ndards as well, in order to remove the unequal treatment and to comply with the WTO \nruling (ICTSD 1999d). \n \n4.2 Measures aimed at extra-jurisdictional environmental protection \nAs concerns trade restrictions, which aim at environmental protection outside a coun-\ntry\u2019s jurisdictions, there have been two major decisions by trade panels and appellate \nbodies, respectively. \nIn August 1991 a panel ruled on the by now famous case of US import restrictions of \ntuna that was caught with fishing technology which resulted in the incidental killing of \ndolphins in excess of the killing rate of US fishing vessels (GATT 1993). The funda-\nmental question to be decided was whether the US had the right to invoke Article XX(b) \nof the GATT to regulate production methods outside its own jurisdiction. While it was \nat pains to assure that \u2018the provisions of the General Agreement impose few constraints \non a contracting party\u2019s implementation of domestic environmental policies\u2019 (ibid., para. \n6.2), the panel was equally clear in ruling against the permissibility of extra-\njurisdictional regulation. It argued that otherwise \u2018each contracting party could unilater-\nally determine the life or health protection policies from which other contracting parties \ncould not deviate without jeopardizing their rights under the General Agreement\u2019 (ibid., \npara. 5.27). Similarly, with respect to Article XX(g) of the GATT, the panel ruled that \u2018a \n17 \ncountry can effectively control the production or consumption of an exhaustible natural \nresource only to the extent that the production or consumption is under its jurisdiction\u2019 \n(ibid., para. 5.31). \nIn the possibly most important ruling so far, an appellate body in October 1998 over-\nruled an earlier panel report concerning US import prohibition of certain shrimp and \nshrimp products (WTO 1998b). In essence, the US had prohibited the importation of \nthese products from countries that were not certified by the US as employing harvesting \nmethods which prevented the incidental killing of five species of sea turtles. The earlier \npanel had found that the US regulation would \u2018undermine the WTO multilateral trading \nsystem\u2019 and could thus not be permitted under Article XX of the GATT (WTO 1998a, \npara. 7.44 and 7.62). If this ruling had passed the appeal to the appellate body, it would \nhave confirmed the environmentalists\u2019 worst expectations that under the WTO\u2019s dispute \nsettlement trade always trumps the environment in case of conflict. The appellate body, \nhowever, fully rejected this finding noting that to maintain the multilateral trading sys-\ntem \u2018is not a right or an obligation, nor is it an interpretative rule which can be em-\nployed in the appraisal of a given measure under the chapeau of Article XX\u2019 (WTO \n1998b, para. 116). It went on saying that the term \u2018exhaustible natural resources\u2019 from \nArticle XX(g) should be interpreted not according to its meaning at the time of drafting \nthe GATT agreement more than 50 years ago, but \u2018in the light of contemporary con-\ncerns\u2019 citing the preamble of the WTO Agreement which embraces \u2018the objective of \nsustainable development\u2019 (ibid., para. 129). It should thus be interpreted as encompass-\ning not only mineral natural resources, but also living species. \nThe appellate body then went on examining whether the US import ban violated the \nchapeau of Article XX. It ruled that the ban amounted to an \u2018unjustifiable discrimination \nbetween countries where the same conditions prevail\u2019 stating that the \u2018most conspicuous \n18 \nflaw in this measure\u2019s application relates to its intended and actual coercive effect on the \nspecific policy decisions made by foreign governments (...) to adopt essentially the same \npolicy (together with an approved enforcement program) as that applied to, and enforced \non, United States domestic shrimp trawlers.\u2019 (ibid., para. 161). Further, it noted that the \nban also affected \u2018shrimp caught using methods identical to those employed in the \nUnited States (...) solely because they have been caught in waters of countries that have \nnot been certified by the United States\u2019 (ibid., para. 165). The panel further pointed out \nthat while the US had negotiated and concluded the Inter-American Convention as a \nregional international agreement for the protection of sea turtles, no serious efforts were \nundertaken to negotiate similar agreements with the appellant countries India, Pakistan, \nThailand and Malaysia. Due to this and some other aspects of the regulation, the panel \njudged that the regulation \u2018imposes a single, rigid and unbending requirement that coun-\ntries applying for certification (...) adopt a comprehensive regulatory programme that is \nessentially the same as the United States\u2019 program, without inquiring into the appropri-\nateness of that program for the conditions prevailing in the exporting countries\u2019 (ibid., \npara. 177). The appellate body also ruled that the US import ban amounted to \u2018arbitrary \ndiscrimination\u2019 as it found that the \u2018certification processes followed by the United States \n(...) appear to be singularly informal and casual\u2019 so that foreign countries could not be \ncertain that they were \u2018applied in a fair and just manner\u2019 (ibid., para. 181). \nIn sum, the appellate body ruled against the way the US imposed its own regulatory \nstandards upon foreign companies, but it did not rule against a need for protection for \nsea turtles. Indeed, the body reserved a full paragraph to emphasise this point: \n \nWe have not decided that the protection and preservation of the environment is of no sig-\nnificance to the Members of the WTO. Clearly, it is. We have not decided that the sover-\n19 \neign nations that are Members of the WTO cannot adopt effective measures to protect \nendangered species, such as sea turtles. Clearly, they can and should. And we have not \ndecided that sovereign states should not act together bilaterally, plurilaterally or multilat-\nerally, either within the WTO or in other international fora, to protect endangered species \nor to otherwise protect the environment. Clearly, they should and do. (ibid., para. 185) \n \nInterestingly, the appellate body did not refer to the panel report concerning US im-\nport restrictions of tuna in its ruling. In effect, it did not uphold the principle, enshrined \nin the earlier tuna-decision, that the US was prohibited from regulating production \nmethods for shrimp harvesting outside its own jurisdiction in order to protect sea turtles \nper se. This is the more important as the tuna panel report was never adopted by GATT \nor WTO, because Mexico, the complaining country, did not find it politically opportune \nto request adoption of the ruling by the GATT council at the time of the then still ongo-\ning negotiations for a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The appellate \nbody in the shrimp-case thus opened the theoretical possibility for extra-jurisdictional \nenvironmental regulation to be consistent with WTO rules. It seems fair to say, how-\never, that at the same time it put up so many conditions, which such a regulation would \nneed to fulfil, that in practice it would be quite difficult for extra-jurisdictional unilateral \nenvironmental regulation to pass scrutiny.4 In the shrimp-case, the US would have had \nto engage in bilateral or multilateral negotiations with shrimp harvesting countries \n(ibid., para. 166). Only if these had proven to be unsuccessful could the US have intro-\nduced unilateral measures. These unilateral measures would have needed to be designed \nsuch that differing conditions in different countries are taken into account (ibid., para. \n163-165), that all countries are granted the same \u2018phase-in\u2019 periods (ibid., para. 174), \nthat the US undertakes the same effort in transferring sea turtle save harvesting technol-\nogy to all relevant parties (ibid., para. 175), and that the certification process is transpar-\n20 \nent and allows affected countries to be heard and to appeal against non-certification \n(ibid., para. 180). \nAs an alternative to unilateral extra-jurisdictional regulation, the appellate body \nstrongly calls for multilateral environmental agreements for the protection of endan-\ngered species. In response to the appellate body report, the United States is now consid-\nering both allowing shrimp imports from non-certified countries on a shipment-by-\nshipment basis if it can be proven that the shrimps have been caught without damage to \nsea turtles and engaging in negotiations for a regional treaty to protect sea turtles similar \nto the Inter-American Convention, which would include the four complainant countries \n(ICTSD 1999b). United States environmental NGOs are unsatisfied with this response, \nhowever, and have already successfully challenged the shipment-by-shipment device \nbefore the U.S. Court of International Trade (ibid.). \n \n4.3 Trade restrictions for health reasons under the SPS Agreement \nAs concerns trade restrictions for health reasons, the major decision so far has been the \nby now famous so-called \u2018beef hormones\u2019 dispute. In January 1998 an appellate body \noverruled an earlier panel report on EC measures concerning meat and meat products \n(hormones) (WTO 1998c). The US and Canada had challenged the European Communi-\nties (EC) import ban on beef from cattle raised with growth hormones. The appellate \nbody in principle upheld the earlier panel ruling that the import ban violated provisions \nof Article 5 of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Meas-\nures (SPS Agreement), which forms part of the WTO system. As the panel did before, \nthe appellate body ruled that the EC had not provided sufficient evidence in the form of \na risk assessment to justify the import ban. In two other important aspects it overruled \nthe earlier panel decision, however. First, it overruled the panel\u2019s finding that the prima \n21 \nfacie burden of proof to demonstrate that the measures related to hormones are based on \na risk assessment rests with the party imposing an SPS measure. Instead, it ruled that the \nparty challenging the measures needs to demonstrate that they are not based on a risk \nassessment (ibid., footnote 180 and para. 253a). Second, the appellate body made clear \nthat a risk assessment need not establish a minimum quantifiable magnitude of risk and \nthat such an assessment need not be confined to quantifiable risks (ibid., para. 253j). In \nresponse to this ruling, the EC has commissioned studies aiming at providing a risk as-\nsessment for justifying its continued import ban (ICTSD 1999a, p. 10). At the time of \nwriting, it was not clear how this conflict would be resolved. It remains to be seen how \nstringent the requirements on WTO-compatible risk assessments will be in order to jus-\ntify higher food safety norms than those warranted by international standards. Article \n5.7 of the SPS Agreement enshrines the precautionary principle, which says that preven-\ntive steps can be undertaken before definite scientific evidence is established, but sub-\njects it to being provisionally and subject to a \u2018more objective assessment of risk\u2019.5 \nThere is a need for strengthening and clarifying the role of the precautionary principle in \nthe WTO system. This will be the more important as future trade disputes about geneti-\ncally modified organisms are already looming at the horizon. We will come back to this \nimportant question of the relationship between the precautionary principle and the WTO \nsystem further below in the next, concluding section. \n \n5. In way of conclusion: Some suggestions for new rounds of trade negotiations \nIf trade liberalisation can lead to increased environmental degradation, then the first \nimportant thing is to be aware of what kind of degradation is caused by what factors \nexactly. Canada, the US and the EU are now committed to a comprehensive study of the \nenvironmental and sustainable development impacts of any potential new round of trade \n22 \nnegotiations (DFAIT 1999; White House 1999; Kirkpatrick and Lee 1999). Environ-\nmental NGOs should welcome this initiative and try to impact upon the scope and de-\nsign of these and similar studies (as a first step, see WWF 1999a). Once the likely links \nbetween trade liberalisation and environmental degradation are established, the NGOs \nshould try to use their influence to bring about adequate policies that can mitigate if not \nprevent environmental degradation. They must press for a strong message to WTO \nmembers that optimal environmental management needs to be in place if trade liberali-\nsation is to be reconciled with environmental protection. As steps toward this, officials \nfrom national environmental ministries and relevant inter-governmental institutions \nshould participate at certain stages in the trade negotiations (WWF 1999b, p. 3). Also, \nregular environmental assessments of the effects of trade agreements should be agreed \nupon. \nThe likelihood of success for such a strategy is heightened if NGOs also press for \ntrade liberalisations that can actually have positive environmental effects if accompa-\nnied by adequate policies \u2014 for example, in agriculture, the energy and fisheries sector \n(see WTO 1997). NGOs could find strong support among free trade proponents for the \nremoval of obstacles in the trade of environmental goods and services and for the grad-\nual abolition of many subsidies that are both economically distorting and environmen-\ntally destructive (OECD 1998, de Moor 1999). In this respect, it is encouraging to see \nthat in the US, Friends of the Earth, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the US Public \nInterest Research Group join together in the \u2018Green Scissors Campaign\u2019 with the aim of \ncutting wasteful and environmentally harmful spending (FoE 1999b). \nThe WTO has recently become much more open towards environmental and other \nNGOs, organising regular meetings and a high level symposium, derestricting the access \nto many official documents and installing a site for NGOs on its webpage (for a sum-\n23 \nmary of these activities see WTO 1999, pp. 32-34). Environmental NGOs could press \nfor a further derestriction of, say, dispute panel submissions and for panel hearings to \ntake place in public rather than behind closed doors. They have won one battle already \nwhen, against the explicit demand of developing countries (ICTSD 1998, p. 8), the ap-\npellate body in the shrimp case ruled that panels are allowed to take into account state-\nments from NGOs, so-called amicus curiae briefs, that are not part of one party\u2019s solic-\nited submission (WTO 1998b, para. 108). The more open-minded representatives of the \ntrade community clearly regard involvement of and approval by environmental NGOs as \ndesirable which increases the chance that NGOs can strengthen their influence in future \ntrade negotiations (see, for example, Sampson 1999). Indeed, they might have to com-\npromise quite substantially and accommodate demands by NGOs, if the new round of \ntrade negotiations is to be successful. In the case of the failed negotiations on a Multilat-\neral Agreement on Investment (MAI) environmental and other NGOs have clearly dem-\nonstrated how important they can be in bringing down agreements that they fundamen-\ntally oppose (see Neumayer 1999b). \nOn the other hand, environmentalists should not, as Daly (1993, p. 26) does, press for \ntariffs that supposedly compensate for international differences in environmental regula-\ntion. As argued above in section 3, \u2018ecological dumping\u2019 and pollution havens have not \nbeen proven to be statistically significant phenomena. Pressing for environmental tariffs \nwill boost the protectionist factions in the developed world, but will completely alienate \nthe developing countries from the environmental case. If environmentalists call for envi-\nronmental tariffs, they will soon find themselves in an unholy alliance with all sorts of \nprotectionist factions, who welcome the call for tariffs for less idealistic reasons \n(DeSombre 1995).6 \n24 \nIf environmentalists are particularly concerned about the environmental record of \nmultinational corporations, then they should demand from host countries that they re-\nquire their companies investing abroad to apply the same environmental standards as in \nthe home country. However, in the end differences in environmental standards are partly \nthe consequence of differences in both the absorptive capacity of differing environments \nand, more importantly, of differing policy priorities. They need not have anything to do \nwith a deliberate attempt to attract dirty industries from developed countries. \nEnvironmental NGOs should try to gain support for their case from developing coun-\ntries, which are so far positively hostile to virtually any form of \u2018greening\u2019 of trade is-\nsues (see, for example, Shahin 1997, Lal Das 1998, and the comments by developing \ncountry delegates in a high-level WTO symposium on trade and the environment as \ndocumented in ICTSD 1999c). For them economic development and poverty alleviation \ntake clear priority over environmental protection and they fear that their development is \nburdened with environmental obligations and their market access to developed countries \nis restricted under what they regard as flimsy environmental pretexts. As Das (1993, p. \n356) has put it bluntly: \u2018There is a contemporary movement of idealists in the West \u2014 \nthe global environmentalists \u2014 who might trigger another round of imperialism in the \nname of saving spaceship Earth\u2019. Such fears might not do justice to most environmental \nNGOs, who often care about the fate of people in developing countries immensely and \nshare many of the demands of developing countries to make the world trading system \nmore favourable to them. However, the tensions are existent and environmental NGOs \nwill find it helpful to alleviate them. One way to do this is for NGOs to press for the \ndesign of environmental measures in a way that they do not represent barriers to market \naccess for developing countries. Many of these fear that they do not have adequate in-\nformation and capacity to comply with, for example, ecolabels, which mainly affect \n25 \ngoods such as textiles, leather, footwear, forestry and food products that developing \ncountries have a comparative advantage in producing and exporting (WTO 1996a). \nAs concerns the settlement of disputes, no changes to Article XX of GATT seem \nwarranted as far as measures are concerned, which aim at domestic environmental pro-\ntection. WTO members have ample leeway to formulate strong domestic environmental \npolicies in a way that the trading rights of other members are not violated. In the cases \ndecided by panels so far, measures were only found inconsistent with GATT\/WTO rules \nbecause different regulations applied to foreign producers. In each case, the regulation \ncould be easily amended to treat foreign and domestic producers alike without jeopard-\nising in any respect the objective of environmental protection. \nThings are far less clear with respect to measures, which aim at extra-jurisdictional \nenvironmental protection. While the appellate body in the shrimp case has in principle \nnot decided against the possibility of such regulation, it has also set up many hurdles, \nwhich would be difficult to get over in practice. Environmentalists are generally in fa-\nvour of unilateral regulation of production methods outside a country\u2019s own jurisdiction, \nif only as a measure of last resort (see, for example, von Moltke 1997, WWF et al. 1998, \nWWF 1999b). This is quite understandable as it would often seem to be the most direct \nway to undertake steps for the protection of endangered species abroad \u2014 with immedi-\nate impact upon those who threaten the species and so much more easier to achieve than \ntedious negotiations for an international agreement. And yet, unilateral measures aimed \nat extra-jurisdictional environmental protection might do more harm than good, even for \nthe environmentalists\u2019 case. It would represent a falling back into a world where power \ndominates rules in solving international conflicts and the stronger countries unilaterally \nprescribe the weaker ones what they have to do, which is exactly why developing coun-\ntries are unambiguous in their united opposition (see ICTSD 1999c). It would be a world \n26 \nin which every country can try to impose its particular value system on others, but only \nthe powerful ones succeed. Such actions would run counter to the spirit of cooperation \nwhich the world is so dire in need for the solving of international and global environ-\nmental problems. \nThere is a dilemma then: On the one hand, unilateral action is undesirable for the rea-\nsons mentioned above; on the other hand, multilateral action is difficult to bring about, \noften takes time and might very well be insufficient. As all real dilemmas, there is no \neasy solution. My personal view is that as long as it has not been convincingly shown \nthat attempts for multilateral environmental agreements are doomed to failure, WTO \nmembers should not have resort to unilateral measures aimed at extra-jurisdictional en-\nvironmental protection. However, WTO members should support the establishment of \nmultilateral environmental agreements then and should ensure that the WTO does not \nstand in the way of effective multilateral agreements. This is because even if unilateral \nmeasures are ruled out, trade restrictions have a clear role to play in promoting envi-\nronmental cooperation, as they can play a vital role as a self-enforcement device in in-\nternational environmental treaties and to contain free-riding (Neumayer 1999a). The \ndifference is that in these cases sanctions are authorised by multilateral agreement and \nare not unilaterally imposed on others. There needs to be clarification that trade restric-\ntions in these multilateral environmental agreements cannot be challenged under the \nWTO dispute settlement \u2014 again, a task for environmental NGOs to press for in the \nnext round of trade negotiations. So far, no country has tried to challenge the trade re-\nstrictions in the Montreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer or the Conven-\ntion on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). But there is hardly any \ndoubt that a potential for clash of rules exists, so clarification is important. \n27 \nAnother mechanism, which can help to achieve species protection (and animal wel-\nfare protection more generally), is via mandatory eco-labelling. The idea is to let con-\nsumers decide whether, to give two examples, they prefer shrimp caught with turtle safe \ndevices or fur from animals caught without leghold traps. So far, Article III of the \nGATT, which states that \u2018like products\u2019 must not be treated differently, is likely to clash \nwith eco-labelling that refers to non-product related process and production methods. \nThe same is true for ecolabels for consumer goods based on ecological life-cycle as-\nsessments. A decision needs be taken at the WTO that such ecolabels are regarded as \nconsistent with WTO rules and do not represent non-tariff or technical barriers to trade. \nYet another aspect on which clarification is important is with reference to the precau-\ntionary principle and food safety standards. Environmental NGOs should press for a \nclarification of the SPS Agreement such that it becomes clear that, in accordance with \nthe precautionary principle, countries can introduce higher than international standards \nwithout conclusive scientific evidence being available. The appellate body in the case of \nEC import ban on beef from cattle raised with growth hormones noted that \u2018the Panel \nitself did not make any definitive finding with regard to the status of the precautionary \nprinciple in international law and that the precautionary principle, at least outside the \nfield of international environmental law, still awaits authoritative formulation\u2019 (WTO \n1998c, para. 123). It should be clarified that a dispute panel should only have the right to \nrule against a measure taken under the SPS Agreement if it comes to the conclusion that \nthe scientific evidence provided is clearly inadequate to establish health risks. It should \nnot have the right to determine the level of precaution itself a WTO member country is \nallowed to apply. In a world of uncertainty and ignorance science itself cannot prescribe \nthe \u2018right\u2019 level of precaution necessary to avoid potential harm (Neumayer 1999c, \nchapter 4). Here as well as in many other cases mentioned above, environmental NGOs \n28 \nhave the important task to press for clarifications and modifications of existing WTO \nrules, which would lead to an environmentally more friendly next round of trade nego-\ntiations. After the disaster of the WTO Ministerial meeting in November 1999 in Seattle \nall negotiations are blocked for the time being. But the current stalemate will be over-\ncome sooner or later. It is then that environmental and other NGOs will face a more im-\nportant battle, which needs to be won. \n29 \nReferences \nNote: All GATT and WTO documents apart from GATT (1993) and GATT (1994) are \nonline available at http:\/\/www.wto.org \n \nAnderson, Kym (1992): The Standard Welfare Economics of Policies Affecting Trade \nand the Environment; in: Kym Anderson and Richard Blackhurst (eds.): The \nGreening of World Trade Issues, Michigan: University of Michigan Press, pp. 25-\n48 \nBarrett, Scott (1994): Strategic Environmental Policy and International Trade, Journal of \nPublic Economics 54 (3), pp. 325-338 \nChichilnisky, Graciela (1994): North-South Trade and the Global Environment, Ameri-\ncan Economic Review 84 (4), pp. 851-874 \nCole, M.A., A.J.

More comprehensive models are ambiguous with respect to whether trade \nliberalisation increases global pollution (see Copeland and Taylor 1997). \n2\n This result depends on firms competing in quantities with each other (so-called Cournot competi-\ntion). If instead they compete with each other in prices (so-called Bertrand competition), then profits from \ninternational markets can be reaped in charging higher prices. Governments have then the incentive to set \nstronger than optimal environmental standards, which allows firms to commit to higher price setting. \n3\n I am grateful to an anonymous referee for pointing my attention to this important aspect. \n4\n I am grateful to an anonymous referee for drawing my attention on this aspect. \n5\n The relevant passage reads as follows: \u2018In cases where relevant scientific evidence is insufficient, \na Member may provisionally adopt sanitary or phytosanitary measures on the basis of available pertinent \ninformation, including that from the relevant international organizations as well as from sanitary or phyto-\nsanitary measures applied by other Members. In such circumstances, Members shall seek to obtain the \nadditional information necessary for a more objective assessment of risk and review the sanitary or phyto-\nsanitary measure accordingly within a reasonable period of time.\u2019 \n6\n In this respect, VanGrasstek\u2019s (1992) empirical finding that linking trade with environmental \nissues fosters support for import restrictions in the US Congress is interesting. More research in this area \nis clearly warranted. \n"}
