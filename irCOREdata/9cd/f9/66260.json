It describes variations in the ethical vocabulary and \nform of these accounts. Analysis of practitioners\u2019 own accounts (as opposed to \n\u2018textbook\u2019 cases) draws attention to the ways they construct events, actions and \nqualities of character as ethically significant and highlights the qualitative \ndistinctiveness of ethical dilemmas, where seemingly irresolvable choices leave a \nresidue of moral loss, regret or guilt.   \n \nEthics and ethical difficulties in professional life  \n \nThe subject matter of ethics is generally regarded as being about how human beings \ntreat each other and their environment \u2013 what actions are regarded as right or wrong \nand what traits of character are good or bad. The central questions in ethics are \nnormative ones relating to: \u2018what should I\/we do?\u2019 or \u2018how should I\/we live?\u2019 \nProfessional ethics covers topics relating to how professionals should act in relation to \nservice users and others (such as how much autonomy they should have or give or \nhow to distribute their resources of time and money) and what kinds of people \nprofessionals ought to be (honest, trustworthy, reliable, compassionate). There is \nobviously a difference between how moral philosophers talk when they are doing \nethics and how we talk about ethics and ethical topics in everyday life. But the two \nare related, and in the field of professional ethics, the academic literature and practice \nguidance both draw on concepts and theories in moral philosophy and feed into their \nusage and development by moral philosophers \u2013 although this relationship is not \nunproblematic (see Banks, 2004, ch. 3).  \n \nTextbooks on professional ethics in the health and welfare field regularly include \nsections on what we term \u2018ethically difficult situations\u2019. These often take the form of \nethical problems or dilemmas presented as \u2018cases\u2019 written up by the textbook author \n 2\nand analysed through the application of explicit ethical theories, principles or \nconcepts. This is the case with one of our own textbooks and many others (see Banks, \n2001, pp. 160-185; Bond, 2000, pp. 223-236; Jones, 1994, pp. 35-119; Seedhouse & \nLovett, 1992, pp. 33-128). Such cases may be real or imagined, or a mixture of both. \nWhat is described and how it is described are necessarily subject to authorial \njudgements of the intelligibility and adequacy of such representations for the \npedagogic task at hand. In other words, even when such cases are offered as \ndescriptions of factual instances, it is impossible to separate the point of view of the \nwriter from the \u2018substantive configuration of values, meanings, discourses, or social \ncontexts assigned to a case \u2018 (Lynch and Bogen, 1996, p. 270). Cases are analysed by \nthe author, or presented for analysis by the reader, as vehicles for the identification, \ndiscussion and\/or promulgation of general principles and rules derived from ethical \ntheory. Authors often assume that such general principles can be applied by any \ninformed agent, resulting in a justified and determinate judgement about what to do in \nthis or in imaginably \u2018similar\u2019 situations. When these ethics cases are designed to be \nused in support of teaching they are often formulated as narratives which present the \nemergence of a \u2018problem\u2019 (a situation where a difficult decision has to be made) or a \n\u2018dilemma\u2019 (a choice between two equally unwelcome alternatives) relating to \nprofessional interventions in matters of human welfare. Here the story endings may be \nunfinished so that the reader is invited to bring closure through a consideration of: \n\u2018what ought the practitioner do in this and other such cases?\u2019 (Banks & Nyboe, 2003; \nChambers, 1997).  \n \nThis paper takes a different starting point, namely, a consideration of accounts given \nby social welfare professionals when asked by researchers to talk about ethical \ndilemmas and problems they have directly met in the course of their work. \nUnsurprisingly, such accounts do not exhibit the exactitude of textbook cases in their \nspecification of the nature of moral judgements and evaluations (responses to the \nquestion: \u2018what ought I to do?\u2019; or \u2018is this just, fair, good?\u2019). However, they will not \nbe treated here as colloquial \u2013 and imperfect - attempts at such exactitude, but instead \nexamined for the ways in which they exhibit details of the conceptual vocabulary of \npractitioners as moral agents, their constructions of relevant organisational contexts of \nactions, their attributions and avowals of professional and moral identity or integrity, \nand the nature of their reflections on actions, reasons, motives and emotions. It is our \n 3\nargument that attention to such mundane details are necessary elements of any \nadequate interrogation of the ethics of social welfare practice. Rather than invoking an \nironic contrast between practitioners\u2019 and philosophers\u2019 accounts of the nature of \nmoral matters, we prefer to approach practitioners\u2019 accounts as exemplifications of \nwhat is ethically relevant, demonstrable and plausible to them as they seek to describe \nand offer judgements of actions and events that they have encountered in the course of \ntheir work lives.  \n \nTheir descriptions and evaluations rely on and exemplify a stock of knowledge about \nwhat kinds of events, actions, people, institutional arrangements and motivations \nroutinely \u2013 and exceptionally \u2013 recur in the course of professional social welfare \nwork. This knowledge is derived from a number of sources, including formal training, \ninformal socialisation and the accumulation of lived experience in relevant \norganisational settings. It can be characterised best as \u2018vernacular\u2019 knowledge insofar \nas it is indigenous to its group of users. It is what Geertz (1973) calls \u2018local \nknowledge\u2019 and Garfinkel (2002) refers to as \u2018autochthonous\u2019.  This vernacular \nknowledge is part of the same setting in which participants are located, as well as \nbeing used by them to account for the setting. In this paper we try to treat this \nknowledge as an explicit topic for our descriptive inquiries into what is accountable as \nan ethical issue for social welfare practitioners. \n \nIt is important to stress that the research described here was not an ethnographic study \nof how practitioners interact with one another in the course of their everyday practice \nand the data presented are not field notes or recordings of witnessed events or \nconversations. Rather, the article examines a series of retrospective accounts of \nethically difficult situations solicited by one of the authors during the course of an \nempirical investigation. These situated accounts necessarily are versions constructed \nfor a specific occasion and recipient (the interviewer asking for reports of ethical \nproblems), and they are not presented or analysed here as unproblematic reflections of \n\u2018what really happened\u2019. Like all such retrospections, their formulation is at least partly \ndetermined by the situation of their production \u2013 in this case a research interview \nrather than an office conversation or a disciplinary hearing (Banks, 2002; Buttny, \n1993; Heritage, 1983). Nevertheless, the construction of such accounts as \nintersubjectively intelligible instances of naturally occurring ethical difficulties \n 4\nnecessarily draws on and exemplifies the stock of conventionally available and \ncollectively recognised logical and discursive resources that make up the lingua \nfranca of social welfare work.  \n \nThe interviews and approach to analysis \n \nIn the course of 32 individual interviews with practitioners working in the social \nwelfare field (social, youth and community work), interviewees were asked to give \nexamples of ethical dilemmas or problems experienced in their practice. The \ninterviews were semi-structured and centred around respondents\u2019 views on the ethical \nimplications of the changing nature of professional practice. This aspect of the \nresearch has been written up in Banks (2004). At the end of the interviews \nrespondents were also asked to describe any ethical problems or dilemmas arising in \ntheir work generally. It is these accounts that form the basis of this paper. \n \nThe interviewees were relatively experienced practitioners in social work, youth and \ncommunity work. They included team managers and senior practitioners in local \nauthority social services departments working in a variety of fields; youth and \ncommunity workers in local authorities, partnerships and voluntary sector \norganisations; and community development practitioners and managers working in \nvoluntary sector, local authority and inter-agency regeneration settings. Interviewees \nwere selected through making requests to organisations for staff willing to discuss \nissues, and through existing contacts.  \n \nThe accounts given by the interviewees varied in both their content and form. This \nwas inevitable, as we asked a fairly open-ended question, along the lines of: \u2018What \nethical dilemmas or problems do you face in your work?\u2019 We deliberately did not \ndefine \u2018ethical dilemma or problem\u2019 because this might cause people to try to ensure \nthat their account fitted the prescribed category. We referred to \u2018dilemmas or \nproblems\u2019 in order to broaden the possibilities of what people felt they could talk \nabout. If respondents then sought further clarification of what we were looking for, \nthe interviewer would widen the description even further, to help them feel they could \nconnect it with their experience. For example, in an interview with a youth worker the \ninterviewer elaborated as follows: \u2018So thinking of ethical dilemmas, ethical problems \n 5\nfor you \u2026 I mean, it\u2019s difficult to say what is an ethical issue, it doesn\u2019t really matter, \nit\u2019s something where you hesitate, or you feel it\u2019s problematic\u2019. \n \nThe interviews were transcribed and then examined using the computer assisted \nqualitative data analysis package NVivo (Bazeley & Richards, 2000; Gibbs, 2002). \nAlthough this package is very amenable to the use of a grounded theory approach to \ndata analysis (Strauss & Corbin, 1990), the kind of analysis offered here is a more \ngeneric form of preliminary qualitative analysis the aim of which is to uncover \ndiscursive themes and issues that recur within and across participants\u2019 accounts in \norder to subject them to more detailed study. Preliminary reviews of the transcripts \nfocused on the types of substantive issues that practitioners reported as ethically \ndifficult, which included issues relating to how much choice service users should \nexercise, the rationing of time and resources and maintaining professional integrity, \nfor example (see Banks and Williams, 2004 for a more detailed discussion). The \nanalysis also served to draw attention to the variations in vocabulary and concepts \nused by the practitioners to recount their ethical difficulties. This included, but was \nnot limited to, their explicit formulations of what any competent professional would \nrecognise as \u2018ethics talk\u2019 \u2013 for example, when and how they made reference to rights, \nresponsibilities or \u2018moral\u2019 qualities of character. It also became apparent that the form \nof the accounts was very varied, in particular the ways in which the tellers featured as \nmoral agents.  \n \nThis led us to differentiate the accounts according to whether they seemed to be about \nethical issues, problems or dilemmas (this is elaborated upon in the next section). It \nshould be noted that our methodology for the accomplishment of this analysis claims \nno special foundational epistemological status. Our identification and description of \ncommon themes, our explication of commonsense reasoning and our clarification of \nassertions about organisational contexts all necessarily rely on \u2018native intuition, \nvernacular categories and commonsense judgements...an immense and varied set of \ncompetences that \"we\" already have available but that are amenable to further \ninstruction and explication\u2019 (Lynch, 1993, p. 305). Others have attempted to develop \nmore formal analytical methods which aim to reduce these competences to \ngeneralised structures of reasoning and interaction (see especially Sacks, 1992), and \nthere is a small body of studies which have already applied these methods to aspects \n 6\n(including \u2018moral\u2019 aspects) of social welfare practice (for examples see: Gunnarsson, \nLinell and Nordberg, 1997; Hall, Juhila, Parton and P\u00f6s\u00f6, 2003; Jokinen, Julila and \nP\u00f6s\u00f6, 1999; Saranji and Roberts, 1999; Taylor & White, 2000; White and Stancombe, \n2003). However the analysis in this paper differs from these in its commitment to a \n\u2018deliberately underbuilt methodology\u2019 (Lynch, 1993, p. 310) to support our \ndescriptions of the understandings of ethical and organisational issues embedded in \ntranscribed accounts. Rather than attempt further to develop or apply a catalogue of \nstructural elements and rules for their combination, our concern is to preserve the \nlocal relevances of participants\u2019 accounts in and through a description of their \nconcrete details. In this short paper we merely make a start on this process. \n \nOur own descriptions were inevitably informed by our knowledge of theories and \nconcepts from the literature of moral philosophy and professional ethics. One of us \n(Banks, 2004) has previously written about theoretical approaches to ethics based on \nduty, utility, rights, the development of moral character, the importance of particular \nrelationships, care and moral sensitivity, all of which have relevance in recognising \nand analysing ethical assertions. Our analytical stance does not necessitate the \nabandonment of such prior knowledge, but only its suspension so that it is not used to \ncharacterise what participants say as instances of one or another formal theoretical \nassertions about relevant professional themes.  \n \nHow practitioners describe ethically difficult situations \n \nIn this section of the paper we will specifically consider some of the discursive \nresources used by practitioners to make ethically difficult situations accountable to the \ninterviewer. These resources comprise a set of detailed vocabularies as well as a set of \noverall forms within which these detailed vocabularies are expressed. We begin by \ndescribing some matters of detail before going on to discuss the overall forms used by \nrespondents to provide a structural narrative for their accounts.  \n \nThe use of \u2018ethics talk\u2019 \nIn some accounts given by practitioners ethical content was explicitly articulated by \ndirect reference to conventionally recognizable ethical principles or concepts such as \n 7\n\u2018rights\u2019, \u2018fairness\u2019 or \u2018respect\u2019, for example. Some practitioners very confidently \nengaged immediately in recognizable \u2018ethics talk\u2019 as soon as they were asked for an \nethical dilemma or problem, and some did not. Some respondents also gave reasons or \njustifications for their actions couched in ethical terms. Accounts can be divided into \nthose that are: \n\u2022 Articulated explicitly in \u2018ethical\u2019 language \u2013 for example, using terms generally \nassociated with \u2018ethics talk\u2019, like: \u2018fairness\u2019, \u2018rights\u2019, \u2018choice\u2019, \u2018confidentiality\u2019 or \n\u2018honesty\u2019. For instance, a regeneration manager framed his dilemma in terms of a \nchoice between some residents\u2019 wishes for a new community building and the \nlong-term sustainability of the community and area as a whole. He justified his \nactions using language that referred to recognisable community development \nvalues, such as the good of the wider community and sustainability. \n \n\u2022 Articulated without the use of specialist ethical terminology, but drawing on the \npractical intelligibility of moral standards and accountability \u2013 for example, a \nsocial worker described a situation that involved her breaking a promise and not \nrespecting a service user, but without actually using the terms \u2018promise\u2019 or \n\u2018respect\u2019. \n \nReferring to emotions  \n \nAlthough the traditional \u2018impartial, detached\u2019 model of ethics expounded by some \nmoral philosophers gives primacy to logical and reasoned argument, increasingly this \nview of ethics is being challenged as too limited and unable to do justice to our ethical \nevaluations and decision-making in everyday life (see Banks 2004, ch. 3, for a more \ndetailed discussion). Emotions, empathy, sensitivity and commitments to particular \npeople also have a significant role to play (see Nussbaum, 2001; Oakley, 1992; \nStocker with Hegeman,1996; Vetlesen, 1994). We were interested, therefore, to \nexamine what reference was made to emotions in these practitioners\u2019 accounts. \n \nIn looking at the accounts we were given of ethically difficult situations, some make \ndirect reference to the emotions of the interviewee, such as embarrassment, frustration \nor anger.  Quite often, however, mention is not made explicitly to the emotions \n 8\ninvolved. In these cases the style of some of the accounts is distanced, cool and \n\u2018rational\u2019, while others give hints at the fact that the practitioner was\/is upset, \nindignant or feels regret. Often this comes over in the tone of voice and body \nlanguage as much as the actual words used. The fact that emotions are not expressed \nin the account does not mean they were not present in the situation, just that this is \nhow the practitioner concerned chose to tell the story on this occasion.   \n \nGiving form to ethical difficulty \n \nGiven we had asked for details of ethical dilemmas or problems experienced in \npractice, we expected the accounts given to feature the interviewees as moral agents \nfacing choices. However, in some cases accounts were given of ethically difficult \nsituations that did not explicitly feature elements of choice or decision-making on the \npart of the narrator. In other cases, participants described situations in which they had \nexperienced ethical difficulties in deciding what to do, while only a small proportion \narticulated a dilemma in its narrowest sense - a choice between two equally \nunwelcome alternatives, that is not easily resolvable.  These three forms are \ncharacterized below. \n \n1.   Ethical issue - a story about situation\/type of situation that has an ethical \ndimension, but which is not articulated as a decision-making situation for the \nperson concerned.  For example, a mental health social worker talked about a case \nwhere she was sure the drugs administered to a patient had exacerbated their \nillness, but it was not framed in terms of a decision or choice for her.  \n \n2.   Ethical problem - a story about a difficult situation, where a decision had to be \nmade, but where there was no dilemma for the person making the decision \u2013 that \nis, it was clear which course of action to take. For example, a social work team \nmanager described a situation where he made a decision to respect the choice of a \nman with \u2018significant\u2019 alcohol problems to remain at home, despite the \n\u2018significant\u2019 risks to his safety and the demands of friends that he was unsafe.  \nThis practitioner felt this was clearly the only decision that could be made, even \nthough it had undesirable consequences for others.  \n \n 9\n3.   Ethical dilemma - a story of a decision-making situation involving a difficult \nchoice between two equally unwelcome alternatives and it is not clear which \nchoice will be the right one. A situation or event itself is not a dilemma, but may \nbe construed as a dilemma by certain people. For example, the manager of a six-\nyear neighbourhood regeneration programme gave an account of having to decide \nwhether to support residents in their desire for a large new community centre, or \nto encourage the scaling down of the project, with long term sustainability in \nmind. The manager had agonised over this choice and felt it was a \u2018no win\u2019 \nsituation.  \n \nSome of the \u2018ethical problem\u2019 formulations may merge into \u2018dilemma\u2019 formats. The \nmoral philosopher Philippa Foot (2002, p. 177) offers one characterization of an \nethical dilemma as a situation where there is evidence for and evidence against what \nan agent ought to do \u2013 and seen in this way it \u2018need not be such as to put anyone in his \n[sic] senses into any uncertainty as to what to do\u2019. Certainly, once a dilemma has been \nsatisfactorily resolved, then it can be reconstructed as an \u2018ethical problem\u2019. But the \ndistinction between \u2018problems\u2019 and \u2018dilemmas\u2019 is useful in that it focuses attention \nnot on the difficult situation itself, but on the agent\u2019s view of it. In resolving a \ndilemma, a choice is made, usually after much thought and agonizing, and one \nalternative is judged to be less bad\/unwelcome than the other. But because the choice \nmade still involves violating some moral requirement or principle, moral agents may \nnevertheless feel remorse or regret at the decision made or action taken. Some moral \nphilosophers identify this as the \u2018remainder\u2019 or \u2018residue\u2019 left by the dilemma (see \nWilliams, 1973, pp. 172 ff; Foot, 2002, pp. 37-58; Hursthouse, 1999, p. 44). \nAccording to Williams (1973; 1981, p. 76) resolving a dilemma (for example, \nwhether to lie to save a life) involves a moral loss or cost (for example, in deciding to \nlie) even though it may be morally justifiable.While there has been some debate about \nwhether the resolution of a dilemma inevitably involves committing a \u2018wrong action\u2019 \n(see Foot, 2002, for arguments against Williams), there is nevertheless agreement \nabout the concept of the \u2018remainder\u2019 left over after a dilemma is resolved, which may \nentail regret (although perhaps not \u2018guilt\u2019 on Foot\u2019s view).   \n \nAlthough we have talked about \u2018resolution\u2019 of dilemmas (meaning a decision is taken \nabout what to do), some philosophers argue that there are \u2018irresolvable\u2019 or \u2018tragic\u2019 \n 10\ndilemmas (Hursthouse, 1999). However, it is clear that what is meant by this is not \nthat a decision is not taken, but that the moral loss or cost (remainder) is enormous. \nThe decision of parents about whether to authorize the separation of conjoint twins \nmight be one such example, where it seems that either both children suffer or die \nwithout an operation, or one dies immediately post-operation, while the other may \nperhaps survive. This is certainly tragic, and in one sense \u2018irresolvable\u2019. But we would \nprefer to characterize it as \u2018resolvable with remainder\u2019.  \n \nAccounting for ethical difficulties: some conspicuous examples \n \nThe following extracts from transcribed interviews provide examples of the three \nforms of accounts described in the previous section. Each is followed by a short \ncommentary and the underlying differences between the three forms are considered \nalongside differences in content in the next section of the paper. Brackets ( ) in the \ntext indicate a significant pause in the speech; dots \u2026 indicate an omission made by \nthe authors. \n \nAccounting an ethical issue \n \nThis account came from a qualified local authority social worker working in a \nchildren and families team. Until recently her team covered child welfare only, but \nrecently the team responsibilities have changed so that her job also includes child \nprotection. This has resulted in child protection work taking priority over care and \nmore general preventative work with children and families. This reflects the growing \nconcern in social work and society generally with the prediction and prevention of \nchild abuse (see Parton, 1998; Parton, Thorpe & Wattam, 1997) and the increasing \nuse of procedures and assessment proformas. The \u2018register\u2019 she refers to in this \naccount is a register of children \u2018at risk\u2019 of abuse held by the social services \ndepartment.  \n \nChild on the register for a number of years, no social work involvement. \nRight? Sandra gets the case. Hadn\u2019t seen a social worker for two years. Sandra \nhad to go out and see them, very embarrassing. And it was ( ) he hadn\u2019t had ( ) \nthe stepfather hadn\u2019t actually abused the girls within the family, or there was \n 11\none girl. He had when he was 18 been babysitting a 14-year old or a 13-year \nold, and I think he touched her up. Right? Before ( ) when he was a lot \nyounger, and because he\u2019d become a Schedule 1 offender, because of \nwhatever he\u2019d done, he was a Schedule 1 offender, he met up with this girl, \nwho had a baby, child protection, conference, on the register, never saw a \nsocial worker again. Right? Two years later Sandra starts working for the \ndepartment and has to go out and make an assessment. And it was \nembarrassing. And they actually ( ) I had to work with this family for six \nmonths, who didn\u2019t want me, and who were basically saying, \u2018we\u2019ve never \nseen anybody for two years and now you turn up and you\u2019re asking all these \nquestions\u2019. \n \n[further clarification sought by interviewer and more details given by \ninterviewee \u2013 omitted from this extract] \n \n\u2026 He was a Schedule 1 offender, so we did have to look into it, which is fine, \nbut I think the department shouldn\u2019t expect us to you know, suddenly enter \ninto somebody else\u2019s life for their own procedures. \n \n\u2026 We\u2019ve got to follow our procedures with no thought as to how the family \nmight perceive the situation. \n \nSandra\u2019s account is marked by compression. She starts by giving just enough \ninformation (not in a sentence format) to sketch in the background details of what for \nher is a familiar social work scenario (an \u2018old\u2019 child protection case). It seems that she \ndoes not want to waste time going over familiar ground, but perhaps her rapid account \nof the background is also an expression of her frustration and impatience with the \nsituation in which she was placed. At the point where she gives information about the \nparticular family, some more precise details are given (ages of participants and so on) \nusing a fuller sentence structure. The account then speeds up again, using single \nwords or short phrases to describe the familiar typical social work process: \u2018child \nprotection, conference, on the register, never saw a social worker again\u2019.  This format \nseems to indicate that these are routine, predictable stages that any family in a child \nprotection case would go through.  \n 12\n This way of telling the story seems to reflect Sandra\u2019s feeling of being a cog in the \nsocial services wheel, just as much as the family is. She uses her name \u2018Sandra\u2019 to \nrefer to herself on three occasions before finally using \u2018I\u2019 when she says \u2018I had to go \nout and see\u2019 the family (she had no choice).  The use of the third person seems to \nemphasise her feeling of powerlessness, being subject to the command of a higher \nauthority, which seems to mirror the family\u2019s resentment at her involvement. She did \nnot want to be there any more than they wanted her.   \n \nThe account does not present the teller as an active moral agent able to make a choice. \nHowever, the way she tells the story is as if she feels she should have had a choice. \nShe should have been allowed to be a moral agent and be able to treat this family \naccording to her own judgement, not the department\u2019s procedures. She does not use \nmany explicitly ethical terms, but when, after telling the story, she offers her \nreflective comments on the situation, this is when it is clearly characterized as an \nethical issue. The essence of the situation for her seems to be summed up in her \ncomment that \u2018the department shouldn\u2019t expect us ..\u2019. Here the \u2018should\u2019 is a moral \n\u2018should\u2019. This is a situation that should not happen. So she is telling the story not as a \ndilemma for her as a moral agent, but as a story about what the institution she works \nfor does to her moral agency. On two occasions she uses the phrase \u2018very \nembarrassing\u2019.  This tells us a lot about why the situation was significant for her \u2013 \nembarrassment may comprise an uncomfortable emotion of being exposed or shown \nup in the eyes of others. Three points strike us particularly about this account: 1) the \nmoral agency of the teller as someone able to make a choice does not feature in the \naccount; 2) the story is given an explicit \u2018ethical\u2019 twist at the end, in the teller\u2019s \nreflective evaluation on what should not have happened; 3) emotion (in this case \nembarrassment) features almost from the beginning and could be interpreted also as \nmarking it as an account with ethical significance.  \n \nAccounting an ethical problem \n \nThe next account was given by the manager of an assessment and information team in \na local authority social services department. He had qualified as a social worker 16 \nyears ago and previously worked as a child protection social worker and in training \n 13\nfor several years. The assessment and information team is responsible for taking all \nnew referrals to the department and screening them against eligibility criteria (adult \nservices) and assessment matrices (children\u2019s services). The eligibility criteria had \nbeen relatively recently developed in this authority at the time of the interview, \nreflecting a growing preoccupation in social services generally with prioritizing and \ntargeting resources at those most \u2018in need\u2019 or \u2018at risk\u2019, according to standardized \ncriteria and matrices (see Harris, 2003; Lymbery, 2000; Parton, Thorpe & Wattam, \n1997).  \n \nIs it because you get a bit older and wiser and think \u2018oh, I\u2019ve dealt with that\u2019, \nyou know? We had a ( ) how old would he be? Mid 50s, this chap, maybe a bit \nolder, lived alone, lived at the top stairs of a flat, had a significant alcohol \nproblem, was at significant risk, was hospitalised because of complications \narising from alcohol. He just didn\u2019t want to go into any kind of detox regime, \nhe just wanted to go home, didn\u2019t want any support, thank you very much, \nwasn\u2019t prepared to consider moving, although people did a lot of work on his \nbehalf to get him a safer environment in which to live. He went home, refused \nto see anybody, you know, and the particular social worker involved with that \none is very, very anxious, as was his personal kind of network of friends. And \nyou know, insisted that we do something, and you know, well, we can\u2019t. He \ndoesn\u2019t want anything. He is rational. He\u2019s able to articulate where he wants to \nbe. \u2018We are as equally as concerned as you are about the risks\u2019, you know. \n\u2018But it\u2019s alright for you\u2019, you know. And he eventually did die. Fortunately not \nfalling down the stairs, but ( ) so I suppose it\u2019s the ( ) one of the things that we \ndo is to carry the risks and responsibilities that other people would rather \ndidn\u2019t exist I suppose really. And ( ) but also balance that with people\u2019s own \nsense of efficacy and choice. I think, as a manager of a team where we\u2019re \nfaced with that sometimes, where we know that people won\u2019t cope particularly \nwell and may indeed put themselves at significant risk of harm, you know, \nwhere we would recommend the services go in, but they choose not to, that ( ) \nI feel able to manage that \u2026\u2026\u2026 \n  \nThe team manager starts his story by explicitly reflecting on his long experience, \nwhich makes it easier to handle difficult situations. He quickly describes the situation \n 14\nin \u2018social work language\u2019, categorizing the service user as having a \u2018significant \nalcohol problem\u2019 and being \u2018at significant risk\u2019.  He does not give details to justify \nthese ascriptions, because what matters in the story is that in his professional \njudgement, and in the view of others, a significant risk was perceived.  Furthermore, \nhaving presented himself as someone with experience and wisdom, he probably \nassumes the interviewer accepts his account of the situation, as when he then says \nsimply that \u2018we can\u2019t\u2019 do anything, with the \u2018we\u2019 referring to the team as part of the \nsocial services department. He then describes the service user\u2019s preferences and \nchoices \u2013 an important consideration in social work ethics \u2013 as well as his own (team \nmanager\u2019s) judgement that the man is \u2018rational\u2019 and able to articulate where he wants \nto be. These are acceptable reasons within the social work sphere to justify not \ninterfering with someone\u2019s freely made choice, so he does not feel the need to explain \nwhy being \u2018rational\u2019 is an important consideration. Again, he would also assume the \ninterviewer was party to this \u2018social work talk\u2019 and reasoning.  \n \nHe then talks first in the voice of the team\/social services department to the concerned \nfriends: \u2018we are as equally concerned\u2019 and then replies in the voice of the friends: \n\u2018But it\u2019s alright for you\u2019. This emphasizes the reality of the situation and the debates \nthat must have taken place.  It gives a brief flavour of there being a dispute between \ntwo parties, before continuing with the very truncated factual account to inform the \ninterviewer of the ending: that the man \u2018eventually did die\u2019, although luckily not from \nan accident (with the assumption that the interviewer knows the story might be \ndifferent if the outcome had been more tragic). There is no trace of a \u2018remainder\u2019 in \nthe form of regret or guilt in this account. No doubts are expressed and the manager \npresents the case as involving no choice for him as a representative of the social \nservices department (there is no statutory or moral duty to intervene when someone is \na competent and rational adult). But he does imply (without giving the details) that \nothers were anxious and wanted things done. Perhaps had it not been for his wisdom \nand experience, the \u2018very, very anxious\u2019 social worker might have spent a lot of time \ntrying to persuade the man to accept more support.     \n \nHe moves on quickly to offer his own reflective comments on the situation, \ncategorizing it as a legitimate example of an ethically problematic situation by \nlocating it within a general category of \u2018risks and responsibilities\u2019 carried by social \n 15\nservices departments\/social workers. He is using recognizably \u2018ethical\u2019 language here, \nproceeding to talk of balancing these \u2018risks\u2019 and \u2018responsibilities\u2019 with people\u2019s own \n\u2018efficacy\u2019 and \u2018choice\u2019.  The use of the term \u2018balancing\u2019 again legitimates the account \nas an ethical problem story featuring the practitioner as someone who has to make \ndifficult moral decisions.  This extract ends with the manager commenting that he \n\u2018feels able to manage\u2019 the carrying of the risks \u2013 reinforcing his self-ascription at the \nbeginning as someone of experience and wisdom.  Particularly noteworthy in this \naccount is: 1) the clear account of moral agency (making a decision not to intervene), \nalthough with no dilemma or difficult choice expressed; 2) use of concepts with \nprofessional and ethical import (\u2018risk\u2019, \u2018rational\u2019) in the main body of the account; 3) \nthe explicit self-ascription by the social worker of certain qualities (age and wisdom); \n4) making a reflective ethical evaluation towards the end of the story, locating it in the \ncontext of the kinds of risks and responsibilities social workers carry in society. \n \nAccounting an ethical dilemma \n \nThis final extract comes from a conversation with the Director of a medium-sized \nvoluntary organisation with a community development brief. She had worked for this \nparticular organisation for one and a half years and had ten years\u2019 professional \nexperience in the voluntary sector. She was talking about people volunteering in their \nlocal communities. Her account can be placed in the context of the recent imperatives \ncoming from central government, particularly through programmes for \nneighbourhood regeneration and renewal, which require the participation of \ncommunity representatives on the various committees, boards and partnerships that \nare developing and implementing local policies (see Banks and Shenton, 2001; \nTaylor, 2002). \n \nWhen you do get communities involved, what do you do when people who are \ndownright obnoxious with the most outrageous attitudes and racist and sexist  \n(  )  become very powerful within the community? How do you control that? \nBecause there are despots out there who are leading community groups. They \nalienate the rest of the decent community, but they\u2019re the ones who are \nnegotiating with the district council. And it\u2019s horrific! Absolutely horrific! \nAnd it does worry me. Because I know government is looking increasingly to \n 16\ndevolve decision making now to a lower and lower level and do they not \nrealise who sometimes they\u2019re going to be devolving it down to?  \n \n\u2026 You\u2019re in the ridiculous situation, you\u2019re in a big meeting in the district \ncouncil, and this guy who is awful, says ( ) makes an accusation, you ask him \nto substantiate it, you challenge him and say \u2018I am sure that didn\u2019t happen\u2019 \nthen it  ( ) \u2018well, you weren\u2019t at the meeting!\u2019 and they\u2019re really aggressive. \nThey also attack the district council, and neither of us really could say \u2018you are \nwrong, you are out of order, that\u2019s not acceptable\u2019.  \n \n\u2026 Yes. There\u2019s a lot of them. Yes, I mean, I had to come back and speak to \nmy worker and said \u2018I am sure you didn\u2019t do this, I just need to check\u2019. I then \nasked her to speak to the guy at the district council, and he said, \u2018yes, I did \nknow [about the accusation] and I didn\u2019t think for a minute that he [the \ncommunity representative] was speaking the truth.\u2019  But it was a whole room \nfull of people and some people may well have believed what he was saying, \nand it doesn\u2019t do the organisation any good. It doesn\u2019t do your staff morale \nany good. And there\u2019s two people, two senior managers, who don\u2019t have any \nmechanism to control an individual that\u2019s very disruptive.  \n \n\u2026 It\u2019s just happened in an informal way that one of  ( )  actually it\u2019s the [name \nof the county council community services department], we\u2019ve been asked \n\u2018how do you find him?\u2019 and we were honest and said \u2018he\u2019s aggressive, he\u2019s \nvery challenging, he puts people down, and he\u2019s not terribly constructive\u2019 and \nthey were saying \u2018yes, we\u2019ve heard that\u2019, so we\u2019re kind of  ( ) so in an \ninformal way they\u2019re addressing that perhaps he\u2019s not working as effectively \nas he should be, so you do have an informal network, and then I should think \nthat if it becomes serious enough, I will be approached to make a formal \ncomplaint. How do you do that with a community member? You have no \ninformal network, and you have no formal means of controlling them. And \nthey\u2019re dangerous!   \n \n\u2026 I think partly why people don\u2019t do it [challenge them] is because the \nbacklash would be so huge, the amount of time it would take dealing with it, \n 17\nmopping up the mess, you do a quick calculation in your head and you just \nthink it\u2019s not worth it, but they should be challenged. But they can make life \nso difficult ( ) I don\u2019t know. It is a big dilemma, and again, I don\u2019t know how \nto address that one, but it needs to be sorted.  \n \nThis practitioner is articulating a current dilemma for her, one that she does not know \nhow to address \u2013 that is, it seems irresolvable.  She mixes discussion of a specific \nexample with the general issue of what to do in cases like this. Her language seems \nlike that of what Dingwall (1977) calls \u2018an atrocity story\u2019. She repeats the term \n\u2018horrific\u2019 twice in the first paragraph and characterises these kinds of people as not \nonly \u2018disruptive\u2019 but also \u2018aggressive\u2019 and \u2018dangerous\u2019.  She does not tell us precisely \nwhat the specific community representative to whom she is referring has said in \npublic about her worker\/her organisation, but it is clear she feels the accusation to be \nunjustified. She says in the first paragraph that this kind of situation \u2018does worry me\u2019, \nbut this is clearly an understatement. In characterising the attitudes of such people as \n\u2018outrageous\u2019 and the situation as \u2018ridiculous\u2019 she is conveying her own feelings of \noutrage and powerlessness (she has no means of controlling such people). \n \nUnlike the team manager in the previous case, this practitioner does not offer any \nreflection on the dilemma in \u2018textbook\u2019 ethical terms. She is focusing on telling her \nstory, rather than doing any work for the interviewer to show how it fits into the \n\u2018ethical dilemma\/problem\u2019 category. But the dilemma is obvious and has the feel of \n\u2018whatever you do will be wrong\u2019 about it. As she says in the last paragraph: \u2018they \nshould be challenged, but they can make life so difficult\u2019. The \u2018should\u2019 here is the \nmoral \u2018should\u2019 or \u2018ought\u2019. If we expand the dilemma it would be along the lines of: do \nyou allow community representatives to make wild accusations in an aggressive, \nobnoxious and despotic manner, which is both unfair and damaging to those accused, \nor do you challenge them and risk a huge \u2018backlash\u2019 which would be very time \nconsuming and difficult to deal with? The Director did not explicitly articulate the \nnature of the backlash, perhaps because she assumed that she and the interviewer \nshared the same understanding of the power of the simplistic rhetoric of community \nparticipation \u2013 namely, that community participation is a good. But it is implicit that \nthis backlash could be equally as damaging to the reputation of her agency as the \naccusations being made. The Director chose the first course of action (allowing the \n 18\ncommunity representative to get away with it) in the immediate context of the specific \naccusation made in a public forum, in that although she questioned the accusation, she \ndid not challenge his right to make such unsubstantiated and damaging comments in \nan aggressive manner. This \u2018solution\u2019 leaves her with a residuum not of regret, blame \nor guilt, as is often the case with dilemmas, but a sense of injustice and outrage. But \nthe dilemma is on-going for her, as she is following up the matter in different arenas \n(with the district and county councils) and pondering on how to tackle similar \nsituations in the future. Particular features of this account are: 1) it explicitly features \nthe teller as a moral agent, facing a dilemma \u2013 a choice about what to do and not \nknowing what to do; 2) it uses ascriptions of moral character (\u2018racist\u2019, \u2018sexist\u2019, \n\u2018decent\u2019, \u2018aggressive\u2019, \u2018honest\u2019) which, perhaps, serve to mark it as a story with \nethical import (as opposed talk of rights, responsibilities and so on); 3) as with the \nother accounts, this teller offers a reflective moral evaluation at the end, including \nidentifying the situation as involving a dilemma, as if to confirm to the interviewer \nthat she has given what was requested. \n \nConcluding comments  \n \nThis paper has explored a number of accounts given by social welfare practitioners \nwhen asked to describe ethical dilemmas and problems in their work. We have been \ninterested in how such accounts are constructed by practitioners and how they can be \ninterpreted by us as intelligibly \u2018ethical\u2019 in character.  \n \nOur analysis and discussion of this material has obviously drawn on a set of \ntheoretical and conceptual resources that has enabled us to identify what we regard as \nthe ethically significant components of the accounts. In particular we have used \nfamiliar concepts and distinctions found in the field of moral philosophy (relating, for \nexample, to rights, responsibilities, character and emotions). However, we were not \nlooking to see how far the accounts given by practitioners of ethical difficulties fitted \nwith the kinds of hypothetical or edited accounts (\u2018textbook cases\u2019) commonly used in \nmoral philosophy and professional ethics. Instead we wanted to discover what could \nbe learned from the direct examination of these practitioners\u2019 accounts about their \nversions of matters relating to right and wrong action, good and bad motives, valid \nreasons and compelling emotions. \n 19\n That their stories are selective, situated, complex and messy \u2013 with political, ethical, \ntechnical and practical elements intertwined \u2013 comes as no surprise. For that is what \nprofessional life is like. Professional practices and the surrounding conventions of \nthose practices provide an essential \u2018embedding network for concepts, standards and \ncriteria\u2019 (Jayyusi, 1991, p. 233). That the accounts are usually not neatly constructed \nin the format recognisable as an \u2018ethics case\u2019 (with a clear \u2018plot\u2019, an embedded ethical \ndilemma or choice and a set of reasons for action justifiable with reference to general \nethical principles) is also not surprising, since these people are social welfare \npractitioners, not moral philosophers. Their accounts instantiate the dominant \nprofessional and moral assumptions necessary to make them intelligible as concrete \ninstances of specific ethical difficulties \u2013 for example, in the second case, the \nassumption that the role of the social worker is to carry (and balance) risks and \nresponsibilities.  \n \nIt is important to recognise that it is in the course of giving such accounts of actions \nand events as constituting ethical problems or dilemmas, that subjects reflexively \nconstruct their own identities as competent ethical, professional practitioners - as the \nkinds of people who possess certain kinds of character traits and behave in certain \nkinds of ways (see Taylor and White, 2000; Williams, 2000a & b). For example, \nSandra\u2019s account of her ethical issue provides the listener with resources for \nconstruing her as a social worker of ethical sensitivity, who experiences the emotion \nof embarrassment when making unjustified interventions. In the second case, the team \nmanager presents himself as a person of experience and wisdom, able to carry the \nrisks and responsibilities that are part of what \u2018we [social workers] do\u2019, whilst the \nDirector in the last case describes herself\/her organisation as \u2018honest\u2019.  This suggests \nthat character traits (traditionally described as \u2018virtues\u2019 in the literature of moral \nphilosophy), notions of professional roles and emotional responsiveness are important \nfeatures of the accounts given by professional practitioners about ethically difficult \nsituations in practice. As Walker (2003, p. 77) comments, moral problems are \u2018nodal \npoints in progressive histories of mutual adjustment and understanding, not \u201ccases\u201d to \nbe closed by a final verdict of a highest court\u2019.  \n \n 20\nThese observations, that such instances of professional discourse serve to constitute \nthe identity of practitioners at the same time that they represent and evaluate the \nactions of others, are especially important for understanding the significance of our \narguments in this paper. Above all else we have been concerned to find a way to \nbegin an interrogation of the seemingly self evident understandings of chronic ethical \ndifficulties encountered in the course of the routine and exceptional accomplishment \nof social work practice. It is our argument that the nature of these difficulties (and \ntheir resolutions) are not best understood by validating or invalidating the descriptive \nand evaluative resources relied on by participants by comparing them with the formal \nvocabulary and grammar of moral philosophy. Instead we want to understand the way \nin which these uses arise \u2018from the meetings and interactions of everyday life\u2019 \n(Bourdieu, 1984, p. 471). An essential feature of our approach is the necessity to \nremain sensitive to the contingencies of the organisational contexts in which these \nissues arise and within which their solutions have to be accommodated. The skilled \nexplication, negotiation and resolution of these matters is the routine accomplishment \nof competent social welfare practitioners. It is hoped that the preliminary observations \nreported here based on practitioners\u2019 accounts will be followed by further work based \non more direct observations of the identification and management of ethical \ndifficulties by social welfare professionals so that the nature of these \naccomplishments may better be understood. \n \nBut are our interests relevant to practitioners themselves? In other words, can our \napproach make any positive contribution to the education, supervision, or the direct \npractice of social workers? We believe it can, insofar as it directly encourages and \nfacilitates the kind of self- and organisational- scrutiny that we might refer to as \n\u2018practising ethical reflexivity\u2019. This is a development of Taylor and White\u2019s (2000, p. \n35) concept of \u2018epistemic reflexivity\u2019, and entails subjecting our own knowledge and \nvalue claims to critical analysis.  As they have pointed out, such scrutiny, whether \ncarried out by students, supervisors or front-line practitioners, involves more than a \nsimple reflection on what has been done (or not done), how, why, and with what \neffect. Instead it encourages practitioners to turn the ethical, professional and \norganisational resources that they implicitly use for competent practice into topics for \nexplicit examination.  \n \n 21\nStudents can be encouraged to write about or speak to each other about their own \nstories of ethical difficulties and then subject these accounts to critical scrutiny along \nthe lines developed here. For example, a close examination of Sandra\u2019s account with \nher supervisor or team will raise issues of how she constructs her moral and \nprofessional identity as sensitive and caring by drawing on certain types of \nprofessional ideals and values gained during her training. Through discussion and \ndebate it may be suggested that this is at odds with other available identities of social \nworkers, for example, as rigorous investigators. A more critical understanding of the \nambiguities and complexities in such constructions of their professional role may help \npractitioners to implement and maintain a commitment to challenge some of the \ndominant assumptions that serve to humiliate and oppress service users. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe are grateful to the practitioners who gave us their accounts and to the Leverhulme \nTrust for a research fellowship that allowed Sarah Banks to collect the data. \n \nReferences \n \nBanks, S.
