For each, an \nadequate account of economic activities should explore how they are related to the \nwider social environment; how they are embedded in a wider nexus of social \ninstitutions; how the latter assist in reproducing the capitalist (or market) economy; \nand how their development is coupled to that of these and other environing \ninstitutions. There are also some important differences among these approaches, \nhowever, which enable an exploration of their respective limitations and also provide \nuseful bases for further theoretical and empirical research. Thus, after presenting \nthese three perspectives on the institutedness and embeddedness of economies, I \nconsider some basic problems in analyzing the improbable stability and \nreproducibility of the capitalist economy, paying particular attention to governance \nand meta-governance.  \n \nPolanyi on the Social Embeddedness of Substantively Instituted Economies \n \nKarl Polanyi (1886-1964) developed a distinctive approach to comparative analysis \nthat stressed the substantive institutedness and social embeddedness of economies. \nHe distinguished between a formal definition of economics as rational, economizing \nbehaviour and a substantive definition of economics as want-satisfying behaviour. \nOn this basis he then criticised the \u2018economistic fallacy\u2019 in which all economic \nconduct is seen as formally rational and economizing and the properties and \ndynamics of non-capitalist economies are thereby assimilated to those of market \neconomies (see Polanyi 1977; also Block and Somers 1984). He considered the \neconomy, in its substantive sense, as 'an instituted process of interaction between \nman and his environment, which results in a continuous supply of want-satisfying \nmaterial means' (Polanyi 1982: 33). He added that, as an instituted process, '[t]he \nhuman economy ... is embedded and enmeshed in institutions, economic and \nnoneconomic. The inclusion of the noneconomic is vital. For religion or government \nmay be as important for the structure and functioning of the economy as monetary \ninstitutions or the availability of tools and machines themselves that lighten the toil of \nlabor' (Polanyi 1982: 34). \n \nThe study of how economies are instituted should start, Polanyi suggests, from how \nthe economy acquires unity and stability, i.e., how the interdependence and \nrecurrence of its parts get secured. He focused here on basic structural principles \nthat might provide such unity and stability rather than on possible strategic or \ndiscursive sources of integration. And, given his interest in both market and non-\nmarket economies, he focused on the dominant principle of distribution of 'want-\nsatisfying material means'. Polanyi identified three such principles associated with \neconomic activities embedded in non-economic institutions: (a) reciprocity among \nsimilarly arranged or organized groupings (e.g., segmentary kinship groups); (b) \nredistribution through an allocative centre linked to a political regime; and (c) \nhouseholding based on production to satisfy the needs of a largely self-sufficient unit \nsuch as a family, settlement, or manor (Polanyi 1944: 47-53; 1977: 34-47; 1982: 35). \nThese principles of symmetry, centricity, and closure are contrasted with the anarchy \nof exchange as mediated through price-making markets in a disembedded and \npotentially self-regulating economy (1982: 35).2 In short, the capitalist market \neconomy is only one form of organizing economic activity and should not be used as \na transhistorical model for interpreting other economies. Polanyi further argued that \ntrade is not necessarily organized in terms of monetary exchange: it can also be \norganized as a gift relationship in reciprocal relationships or be administered from \nabove in redistributive systems (1982: 40-45). Symmetry, centricity, and market \nexchange can also be combined under the dominance of one principle. For example, \nreciprocity may be linked to turn-taking in work tasks (redistribution) and\/or exchange \nat set equivalencies to benefit a partner short of certain necessities (Polanyi 1982: \n37). As well as its obvious role in historical and comparative analysis, this typology \nserves other (and partly moral) purposes for Polanyi: to establish the specificity of \n 2\nthe capitalist market economy and to show that distribution and trade need not be \nsubordinated to monetary gain. \n \nPolanyi distinguished capitalist from non-capitalist economic relations in terms of \ntheir separation (or disembeddness) from non-economic institutions and their \nextension to the fictitious commodities of land, labour, and money. In pre-capitalist \neconomies, the process of production was more or less firmly embedded in a wide \nvariety of institutions such as the family, neighbourhood, community, etc. (Polanyi \n1944: 46-53; 1982: 30). Indeed it was this very embeddedness that led Polanyi to \ndistinguish forms of economic life in terms of their principles of distribution rather \nthan their relations of production. Thus he argued that, whilst it was often hard \nanalytically to disentangle production from other social activities, one could generally \nidentify the operational principles governing resource distribution.3 But the rise of \ncapitalism involved the disembedding of production and distribution from all extra-\neconomic institutions, led to the growth of an autonomous market economy that \noperated in terms of profit-maximization, and even required the adaptation of \nessentially non-economic social relations and institutions to the demands of \neconomic reproduction. Polanyi expresses this as follows: \n \n'Instead of economy being embedded in social relations, social relations are \nembedded in the economic system. The vital importance of the economic \nfactor to the existence of society precludes any other result. For once the \neconomic system is organized in separate institutions, based on specific \nmotives and conferring a special status, society must be shaped in such a \nmanner as to allow that system to function according to its own laws. This is \nthe meaning of the familiar assertion that a market economy can function \nonly in a market society' (Polanyi 1944: 57, italics added). \n \nThis statement provides an important corrective to those one-sided readings of \nPolanyi that emphasise only the disembedding of the capitalist economy from pre-\ncapitalist social arrangements and institutions. But it is also misleading because it \nseems to suggest that social relations themselves subsequently get embedded in the \neconomic system. Yet what Polanyi actually proposes is that society, in and through \nthe agency of a wide range of social forces, seeks to constrain the destructive \n 3\nanarchy of the free market by subjecting it to various forms of extra-economic \nregulation that nonetheless support and sustain capital accumulation. To the extent \nthat these extra-economic forms become interiorised within and\/or become \nstructurally coupled to the market economy they may be said to be \u2018embedded\u2019 \nwithin it. But one could equally well (and with greater clarity) argue, as does Polanyi \nhimself, that the market economy has been embedded within a market society. This \nis especially clear in his analysis of the four interconnected pillars that sustained and \nregularized the liberal regime -- the balance of power system, the international gold \nstandard, the self-regulating market, and the liberal state (Polanyi 1944: 3). How and \nwhy this occurs (and thereby produces what regulationists would term a \u2018mode of \nregulation\u2019) will be considered later (for a presentation of the hierarchy of concepts \nthat inform Polanyi\u2019s historical and comparative analyses, see Figure 1). \n \n      \n         Figure 1 about here \n \n \nIn this and other respects, Polanyi's analysis anticipated some arguments of the \nParisian regulation school. Thus, in his history of trade and markets as well as his \neconomic anthropology, he argues that societal (institutional) conditions sustain the \n(circular) interdependence of economic movements and ensure their \u2018recurrence\u2019 \n(i.e., their continued reproduction) \u2013 without which neither the unity nor stability of the \n(instituted) economic process is possible. He writes that '[t]he instituting of the \neconomic process vests that process with unity and stability; it produces a structure \nwith a definite function in society; it shifts the place of the process in society, thus \nadding significance to its history; it centers interest on values, motives and policy. \nUnity and stability, structure and function, history and policy spell out operationally \nthe content of our assertion that the human economy is an instituted process' \n(Polanyi 1982: 34). \n \n \n \nThe Regulation Approach \n 4\n Like Polanyi, regulationists reject the assumption of classical economics that there is \na clearly delimited, socially disembedded sphere of economic relations with a \ntendency toward general equilibrium.4 They emphasize that economic rationality and \ndynamics cannot be adequately analyzed \u2013 even as a first approximation -- in terms \nof exchange relations between rational economic men oriented to the price \nmechanism in perfect markets. Instead, they are concerned with the socially \nembedded, socially regularized nature of capitalist economies rather than with pure, \nself-regulating market phenomena. In this sense, the regulation approach (hereafter \nRA) regards market forces as only one (albeit critically important) factor in capitalist \nexpansion. For capitalism in its integral5 sense comprises extra-economic as well as \neconomic factors. The former include institutions, collective identities, shared visions, \ncommon rules, norms, and conventions, networks, procedures, and modes of \ncalculation. All have key roles in structuring, facilitating, and guiding (in short, \n'regulating' or, better, 'regularizing') accumulation. Thus the RA seeks to integrate the \nanalysis of political economy with that of civil society and the state to show how they \ninteract to 'normalize' the capital relation. It examines the social processes and \nstruggles that define and stabilize modes of economic calculation and norms of \neconomic conduct. Indeed, its concept of 'mode of regulation' covers the social as \nwell as economic modes of economic regulation that secure the conditions for the \notherwise improbable reproduction of a specific accumulation regime, i.e., a \nparticular dynamic configuration of production and consumption (for a general \nintroduction see Boyer 1990; for a recent encyclopaedic survey, see Boyer and \nSaillard 1995; for a recent critique, Jessop 1997a). \n \nThe RA reminds one here in certain respects of Polanyi's account of the 'double \nmovement' of capitalist development. He argued that the market economy achieved \nits apogee in the nineteenth century in a movement that effected the rise of laissez-\nfaire and the disembedding of the market from its earlier institutional context. This \nprovoked a counter-movement from society (sic) expressed in attempts to re-embed \nmarket forces in social institutions and thereby to regulate (or, since this is not \nconfined to law and the state, one might say 'to regularize') the market mechanism. \nThe RA also examines how the \u2018extensive accumulation regime\u2019 of 'liberal capitalism' \nemerged from ancien r\u00e9gime economies, shows how this entailed the disembedding \n 5\nof market forces from the old order, and notes how a \u2018competitive mode of regulation\u2019 \nand nightwatchman state had key roles in regularizing this accumulation regime.6 \nDespite these commonalities, the RA does not share Polanyi's views on the 'double \nmovement'. For it argues that liberal capitalism already had its own distinctive forms \nof social embedding and social regulation. Nonetheless its distinctive crisis-\ntendencies eventually led to structural crises of (and not just within) liberal capitalism \nand its 'competitive mode of regulation'; and, after economic, social, and political \nstruggles, a new regime emerged based on 'intensive accumulation' and a \n'monopolistic mode of regulation'. Thus, whereas Polanyi tends to depict a two-step \nmovement from unregulated to regulated capitalism, the RA describes a crisis-\nmediated movement from one regularized regime to another, each with its own \ndynamic and crisis-tendencies (for regulationist analyses of the ancien r\u00e9gime and \nliberal economies, see Boyer 1990; and Delorme and Andr\u00e9 1982). \n \nAutopoietic Systems Theories and Governance \n \nAnother approach concerned with the embedding and regularization of economic \nactivities is the systems-theoretical analysis of so-called 'autopoietic' systems in \nmodern, functionally differentiated societies. The concept of autopoiesis (or \u2018self-\nproduction\u2019) denotes a class of systems (whether natural, social, or artificial) that are \nconcerned, at least in the first instance, with their own self-reproduction. Such \nsystems are self-constituting, self-organizing, and self-reproducing. Yet they co-exist \nand co-evolve in complex ways with other systems with which they are reciprocally \ninterdependent. This paradoxical combination of operational autonomy and material \ninterdependence poses problems regarding the external steering (governing, \nguiding, managing) and\/or strategic coordination of different systems. \n \nAn autopoietic system is self-constituting in so far as it defines and defends its own \nboundary vis-\u00e0-vis its self-defined external environment. It is also self-organizing \nbecause it has its own distinctive operational codes and programmes. Hence, while \nan autopoietic system may respond to changes in its environment and even change \nits organization in so doing, it does so in terms of its own codes and programmes. \nInterestingly this idea was anticipated, in the case of the market economy, by \nPolanyi, who notes that we have 'an economic system controlled, regulated, and \n 6\ndirected by markets alone; order in the production and distribution of goods is \nentrusted to this self-regulating mechanism ... Self-regulation implies that all \nproduction is for sale on the market and that all incomes derive from such sales. \nAccordingly, there are markets for all elements of industry, not only for goods \n(always including services) but also for labor, land, and money, their prices being \ncalled respectively commodity prices, wages, rent, and interest' (Polanyi 1944: \n68,69). In addition, an autopoietic system also secures the reproduction of its own \nelements through the use of its own elements. This feature is well illustrated by the \nmarket economy. For, as Polanyi again noted, it deals with 'inputs' such as labour-\npower, land, and money as if they were commodities and subjects them to its own \nforms of economic calculation. More generally, the market economy could be seen \nas an autopoietic system to the extent that market forces define what will count as \nexchange-values, secure the exchange of the latter through market mechanisms, \nand also ensure the recurrence of market relations through the continuing circulation \nof commodities in exchange for money (cf. Luhmann 1986; Baecker 1988). \n \nAn autopoietic system always co-exists with other systems that constitute key \nelements in its environment and depends on them for essential conditions for its own \noperation. And it is always structurally coupled to its environment through complex \nprocesses of co-evolution among reciprocally interdependent systems. The co-\nevolution of different systems is also shaped by the 'lifeworld' (which Polanyi could \nbe said to analyse in terms of \u2018society\u2019) that is formed by various social relations, \nidentities, interests, and values not otherwise anchored in specific systems. In short, \ndespite its capacity for self-valorization (or self-constitution, self-organization, and \nself-reproduction), the market economy is by no means wholly self-contained. \nIndeed, labour-power itself, despite its commodification (or, as Polanyi claims, its \ntreatment as if it were a commodity), is largely reproduced outside any immediate \ncapitalist labour process.7 This provides an important source of friction or resistance \nto the logic of capital \u2013 although how the market economy responds thereto will still \ndepend primarily on its own profit-and-loss calculations.8 This explains the \nsignificance of trade unions, for example, which insert themselves into the economic \nprocess. For, even if changes in an autopoietic system\u2019s environment are reflected in \nchanges in its operation or structure, the latter will always be mediated by its own \noperating codes. \n 7\n This raises a problem regarding the steering of relations among functionally \ndifferentiated systems. For such systems are concerned in the first instance with \ntheir own self-reproduction rather than with their impact on other systems; yet they \nare also resistant to any external 'steering' based on top-down management or direct \nintervention. Autopoietic systems analysis connects here to more middle-range \nresearch on organizational and institutional governance. This includes work on \nmodes of coordination that could serve as an alternative to the anarchy (or invisible \nhand) of the market and the hierarchy of imperative coordination (e.g., the iron fist of \nthe state or bureaucratic command). These alternatives are based on 'heterarchy', \ni.e., self-organization among mutually interdependent actors. . Polanyi gives several \nexamples of such self-organization as well as of state intervention in describing how \n\u2018society\u2019 defends itself against the anarchy of the market (see below). The forms of \nheterarchy include interpersonal networking, inter-organizational negotiation, and \n'de-centred intersystemic context steering'. The last basically involves efforts to steer \n(guide) a given system by modifying the circumstances in which its operating codes \nare applied rather than through externally imposed imperative coordination. This can \nbe illustrated through the use of taxes rather than law to guide market forces (see \nGlagow and Willke 1987; Willke 1992).  \n \nRethinking Market Society  \n \nOrthodox historical materialism argues that accumulation is the dominant principle of \nsocietal organization in every capitalist social formation.9 All three approaches \npresented above offer good reasons to reject this orthodoxy. Each seems to accept \nthat capital accumulation in its pure form10 occurs where the key inputs into capitalist \nproduction take the form of (perhaps fictitious) commodities; where there is effective \ncapitalist control over labour-power in production; where the non-economic social \nand material environment is sufficiently stable to enable enterprises to orient their \nactivities to opportunities for profit; and where profits can be realized and re-invested \nin a new round of capitalist production. But none concludes from the presence of \nthese conditions that the entire society must thereby be to the market.  \n \n 8\nOn the contrary, each approach implies that the universal spread of the commodity \nform and the resulting dominance of market forces and profit-and-loss calculation \nthroughout society could prove self-destructive. This is certainly Polanyi\u2019s message. \nRegulationists likewise emphasise the necessarily social as well as economic form of \ncapitalist reproduction even during the period of liberal accumulation regimes. And \nautopoieticists claim that the smooth functioning of modern societies depends \ncritically on maintaining the operational autonomy of each and every one of its \nfunctional subsystems. In short, for all three approaches, capital accumulation \nalways and everywhere depends on a precarious and changing balance between \ncommodity relations and other forms of social organization. This dependence \ngenerates a complex, conflictual, and contradictory process involving recurrent shifts \nin the relative weight of commodification, decommodification, and recommodification \n(cf. Offe 1975). In turn this highlights the importance of analyzing how far market \nforces (and their profit-seeking logic) penetrate the social world and of examining the \nconditions the conditions for such penetration to be reproduced. \n \nThere are four interrelated ways in which market forces and profit-seeking can come \nto dominate society. First, the commodity form and the logic of exchange can be \nextended to labour, land, and money11 and then into new spheres of social life. Neo-\nliberalism, for example, (re-)commodifies political, educational, health, welfare, \nscientific, and other activities to organize them as businesses oriented to exploiting \nopportunities for profit without regard to possible extra-economic costs and benefits. \nSecond, even domains or activities that, for whatever reason, retain a primarily non-\ncommercial orientation can be subjected to a secondary economic coding. This \noccurs when choices among formally non-commercial activities are influenced by \n'profit-and-loss' or economic 'cost-benefit' calculations. This trend is reflected in \nPolanyi's argument that the novelty of nineteenth century civilization lay in its \ntendency to judge all social events from the economic viewpoint (1944: 33-34). It is \nseen today in neo-liberal encouragement to educational, health, scientific, and other \ndecision-makers to consider how their activities impact financially on the individual, \norganizational, and institutional levels and\/or on the (perceived or discursively \nconstructed) imperatives of a strong, internationally competitive economy. \n \n 9\nThird, the superior dynamism and reach of a globalizing capitalist economy may \ncause more problems substantively for other systems than they cause for it. In other \nwords, in the multilateral structural coupling of systems, other systems adjust more \nto the logic of accumulation than the capitalist economy incurs costs in adjusting to \nthem. This is implied in Polanyi\u2019s claim, quoted above, that a market economy can \nonly function in a market society. This asymmetrical interdependence among \ninstitutional orders is rooted in capital\u2019s greater capacity to escape the constraints \nand controls of other systems. This can occur through its own internal operations in \ntime (discounting, insurance, risk management, futures, etc.) or space (capital flight, \nrelocation, extra-territoriality, etc.) or through attempts to corrupt or commodity these \nsystems. Fourth, a successful hegemonic project may establish accumulation as the \ndominant principle of societalization. This can be seen in the increasing demand for \nother spheres of social life on spatial scales from the local to the continental to \naccept the 'imperatives' of 'structural' or 'systemic' competition, i.e., competition that \ngoes beyond narrow economic criteria to include wholesale restructuring of any \norganizations and institutions that might bear on competitiveness.  \n \nThese tendencies have their own particular bases and may even partly counteract \neach other. The first is rooted in the search to establish and extend the bases of a \nself-regulating market economy and to find new sources of valorization; the second \nis rooted in attempts to impose the economizing, profit-seeking logic of accumulation \non other systems that are not (or cannot be) fully integrated into the market \neconomy; the third is rooted in the evolutionary logic of structural coupling or co-\nevolution; and the fourth is rooted in struggles for hegemony and\/or in asymmetric \ninteractions between capitalism and other orders. \n \nWhere these four tendencies are mutually reinforcing the market economy can be \nconsolidated in a market society. Thus, as Polanyi puts it, the consolidation of the \nmarket mechanism 'means no less than the running of society as an adjunct to the \nmarket\u2019 (1944: 57). Such a correspondence between market economy and market \nsociety is reminiscent of Gramsci's account of the 'historical bloc', i.e., 'the necessary \nreciprocity between structure and superstructure' (Gramsci 1971: 366). The \nemergence and survival of such an historical bloc between market economy and \nmarket society is always problematic, provisional, and unstable. If the self-regulating \n 10\nmarket economy requires that 'society must be shaped in such a manner as to allow \nthat system to function according to its own laws' (Polanyi 1944: 57), then we must \nask how this alleged necessity comes to be contingently realized. Four ways in may \nhappen have just been suggested. Where they interact in a structurally coherent \nmanner, we have a 'capitalist society' or, more precisely, the dominance of capitalist \nsocietalization. \n \nApproaching capitalist societalization in these terms also provides a way to think \nabout sources of resistance to capitalist dominance or hegemony. Each of the four \ntendencies has its own limits and counter-tendencies and is associated with its own \nform(s) of resistance. First, in so far as valorization has become dominant in different \ndomains, class struggles proper can develop. These can emerge both in the \ncapitalist economy in its narrow sense \u2013 notably in the labour market and labour \nprocess that together comprise the main field of economic class struggle between \ncapital and labour but also in respect of the commodification of land and money \u2013 \nand in the many and varied extra-economic contexts that are essential to capitalist \nexploitation. In the latter regard Polanyi argues strongly not only that class interests \nare not just economic (1944: 152-4) but also that there is a general societal interest \nthat overrides particular class interests (1944: **). Indeed he even argues that the \nreaction of classes to unregulated market forces is one of the ways in which \u2018society\u2019 \nresists its destruction by the market (1944: 132, quoted below). More generally, if \ncommodification is pushed too far it will generate 'market failures' (or other \nmanifestations of economic crisis) that threaten the overall material and\/or social \nreproduction of capital.  \n \nSecond, in domains where another code or institutional logic remains primary, \nagents may resist the imposition of profitability as a secondary code. For this would \nthreaten the codes, programmes, and operational integrity of other systems as well \nas the rich variety of values, norms, vocabularies, and identities of the lifeworld. It is \ntherefore unsurprising that the representatives of other systems and social forces in \nthe lifeworld will resist attempts at commodification from diverse perspectives. It is in \nthis context that Polanyi criticizes the vulgar Marxist tendency to overemphasize \nclass struggles, notes the importance of non-class bases of resistance to the logic of \nthe market economy, and also highlights the wide range of forces that respond more \n 11\nor less spontaneously to the many threats posed to \u2018society\u2019 by the spread of market \nforces (Polanyi 1944: 132,149,152). Thus he writes:  \n \n\u2018While monetary interests are necessarily voiced solely by the persons to \nwhom they pertain, other interests have a wider constituency. They affect \nindividuals in innumerable ways as neighbors, professional persons, \nconsumers, pedestrians, commuters, sportsmen, hikers, gardeners, \npatients, mothers, or lovers \u2013 and are accordingly capable of \nrepresentation by almost any type of territorial or functional association \nsuch as churches, townships, fraternal lodges, clubs, trade unions, or, \nmost commonly, political parties based on broad principles of adherence\u2019 \n(Polanyi 1944: 154). \n \nAlthough this passage tends to prioritize resistance from the lifeworld, his reference \nto professional persons and patients hints at resistance in terms of the logic of other \nsystems too. Nor should we ignore the self-limitations due to market failures of \ndifferent kinds (e.g., the continuing limits to the commodification of information and \nknowledge) and the repercussions of the market economy on social cohesion.  \n \nRegarding the third and fourth tendencies, struggles can occur over the dominant \nprinciple of societalization. These take the form of hegemonic struggles and counter-\nstruggles over those forms of 'common sense', worldviews, etc., that posit capital \naccumulation as the desirable and\/or necessary condition for accomplishing other \nsocial goals. Given his eye for historical detail, it is unsurprising that Polanyi also \nrecognises these issues. He not only alludes to the tendency for the logic of a fully \nconstituted market economy to become irresistible (see above) but also notes the \nrole of hegemonic struggles around the entrenchment or rolling back of the \nexpansive logic of the market. Thus he suggests that the double movement  \n \n\u2018can be personified as the action of two organizing principles in society, \neach of them setting itself specific institutional aims, having the support of \ndefinite social forces and using its own distinctive methods. The one was \nthe principle of economic liberalism, aiming at the establishment of a self-\nregulating market, relying on the support of the trading classes, and using \n 12\nlargely laissez-faire and free trade as its methods; the other was the \nprinciple of social protection aiming at the conservation of man and nature \nas well as productive organization, relying on the varying support of those \nmost immediately affected by the deleterious action of the market \u2013 \nprimarily, but not exclusively, the working and the landed classes \u2013 and \nusing protective legislation, restrictive associations, and other instruments \nof intervention as its methods' (1944: 132).  \n \nThis argument can be taken further not only by noting the different economic and \npolitical programmes and ethico-political visions into which economic liberalism is \narticulated but also by considering the range of counter-hegemonic projects that can \nbe developed to resist the onward march of liberalism. For, if society\u2019s fightback is to \nmove beyond dispersed, disorganized, and mutually contradictory struggles, \nattention must be paid to the ways in which \u2018society\u2019 acquires a relative unity and \ncohesion in resisting capital\u2019s unhampered logic. For, as Polanyi argues, the reaction \nof society to the destructive impact of liberal market forces is not conducted merely \nin terms of sectional interests but in the name of the general interest of society as a \nwhole. This is where the role of specific economic, political, and social projects, of \nhegemonic visions, and of associated strategic capacities becomes crucial. Indeed, \nas Polanyi was well aware, it makes a world of difference whether this resistance is \nconducted under the dominance of fascism,12 social democracy, corporate liberalism \n\u00e0 la New Deal, or a communist regime. And he also saw a maximally decentralized \nsocialism (his preferred alternative, which would overcome the institutional \nseparation of the economic and the political) as \u2018essentially, the tendency inherent in \nan industrial civilization to transcend the self-regulating market by consciously \nsubordinating it to a democratic society\u2019 (1944: 234). \n \nThis approach to the market economy and market society provides a novel way of \ninterpreting Polanyi's analysis of the 'double movement'. In this regard we can \nusefully distinguish four key points implicit in Polanyi\u2019s analysis of this dual process. \nFirst, the double movement involved continuous expansion of the market and \nattempts to protect \u2018society\u2019 from this first movement. Second, although the \ncountermovement was essential to defend society from the annihilating effects of the \ncommodification of land and labour, \u2018in the last analysis it was incompatible with the \n 13\nself-regulation of the market, and thus with the market system itself\u2019 (Polanyi 1944: \n130). In this sense it could not be taken too far without undermining the market \neconomy. This point highlights the \u2018autopoietic\u2019 nature of the market economy, i.e., \nits resistance to outside intervention. Given the autonomization of the economy, \nsociety had to be shaped to allow that system to function according to its own laws. \nThird, this meant that the many and varied interventions of \u2018society\u2019 (most notably, \nbut by no means solely, through the state) were limited to \u2018checking the action of the \nmarket in respect to the factors of production, labor, and land\u2019 (1944: 131). Fourth, in \nother respects, the effect of the dual movement was to embed social relations within \nthe market rather than to re-embed the economy within social relations (1944: 57). \n \nThis interpretation, while consistent with Polanyi's own study of the dual movement, \noffers four theoretical advantages. First, it provides a more complex and concrete \naccount of the tendency of a market economy to extend its reach into society, \ndisembedding individuals from the wider ensemble of interpersonal relations, \norganizational affiliations, institutional and community roots, and broader societal \nframeworks within which they operate. Second, it provides a more complex and \nconcrete account of how 'society' fights back against this disembedding process. In \nparticular, as Polanyi often notes, this reaction is neither directed against market \nforces (or capitalism) as such nor is it a reaction of 'society' as such. Instead it is a \ncomplex series of reactions at many different points in social space to specific \nconflicts, crisis-tendencies, and contradictions associated with the unregulated \nextension of market forces (on this point see also the insightful commentary in \nOlofsson 1995). Third, by integrating Polanyi\u2019s conclusions with the arguments of \nautopoietic systems theory, it offers a theoretically more sophisticated analysis of the \nlimits to external intervention into the market (or capitalist) economy once this has \nreached \u2018autopoietic takeoff\u2019. This analysis also facilitates research on the structural \ncoupling of the market (or capitalist) economy with other systems (legal, political, \neducational, medical, etc.) and the lifeworld to produce a social formation dominated \nby the principles of accumulation. But, fourth, drawing on the insights of regulationist \nand autopoietic systems theories into the modalities and dynamics of governance, \nthe proposed approach can also provide new ideas not only about the manner in \nwhich social relations get embedded into the market economy but also how the latter \nmay also be re-embedded into the wider society. \n 14\n  \nRethinking Social Embeddedness \n \nAfter this detour via reflections on the market society and market economy, we return \nto social embeddedness. This is an increasingly popular but confusingly polyvalent \nconcept. The discussion above suggests it is useful to distinguish three levels of \nsocial embeddedness.13 The first level is often discussed in recent work in economic \nsociology, namely, the 'social embeddedness' of interpersonal economic relations \n(cf. Granovetter 1985). Such research focuses on the multiple networks in which \neconomic actors are embedded (or, following Callon 1998, \u2018entangled\u2019) and on their \ndifferential and changing impact on such actors\u2019 identities, interests, capacities, and \npractices. Indeed, theorists of interpersonal embeddedness tend to show what Adam \nSmith knew long ago: that economic actors tend to make strenuous efforts to re-\nentangle economic relations in a nexus of social relations as a crucial condition for \nthe stability and predictability of markets. On an individual level this is reflected in the \nrelative (dis)advantages of strong or loose ties among individuals and associated \nproblems of trust in situations of reciprocal interdependence. It is tempting to claim \nthat Polanyi\u2019s historical and\/or anthropological studies introduced this level of \nanalysis in dealing with the embedding of economic activities within a wider nexus of \nsocial relations. But this would be anachronistic as Polanyi also took pains to note \nthat such activities were not subject to the sort of economizing, profit-and-loss \ncalculation that typifies contemporary economic activities.14 At best, then, one could \nrefer to his discussion of haute finance, cooperatives, friendly societies, self-help, \netc., as mechanisms for the interpersonal embedding of market-oriented economic \naction. \n \nThe second level of embeddedness is what we might describe as the \u2018institutional \nembeddedness\u2019 of inter-organizational relations (cf. Grabher, 1993). These relations \ncan be studied in some respects with the same basic tools as interpersonal relations \nbut they also have important emergent properties that require fresh analytical tools. \nThus organization theorists and \u2018new institutionalists\u2019 have explored the difficulties \ninvolved in securing the internal cohesion and adaptability of individual organizations; \nand in rendering compatible their respective operational unities and independence \n 15\nwith their de facto material and social interdependence on other organizations. \nNegotiation has a key role here in reconciling these conflicting interests by identifying \ncommon short-term objectives and using these to promote longer-term cooperation \nin joint projects (cf. Mayntz 1993; Scharpf 1994). Studies of this form of economic \nembeddedness focus on the specificities of strategic alliances, inter-firm networks, \netc., their path-dependent character, and the mechanisms of organizational learning. \nThey also suggest that the capacity to steer inter-organizational relations often \ndepends critically on effective interpersonal networks that can stretch social relations \nover time and space by drawing on interpersonal trust. Although Polanyi did not \nexplicitly theorize this aspect of embeddedness, it is implicit in his analysis of haute \nfinance (see below). \n \nThe third level is that of the 'societal' embeddedness of functionally differentiated \ninstitutional orders in a complex, de-centred society. This is where Polanyi's work is \nmost relevant and where, pace Swedberg (1997),15 the concept of embeddedness is \ncritical to an understanding of his work. For he examined the embedding of market \nrelations in traditional societies; their disembedding to form a market economy; and \nthe latter\u2019s re-articulation with other forms of social relations to create a modern \nmarket society. If traditional societies are characterized, for Polanyi, by the \nembedding of substantive economies in the wider society, modern market \neconomies are marked both by their institutional separation (disembedding) from \ntraditional (pre-modern) institutions and by the interiorisation of extra-economic \nconstraints within the logic of market forces themselves (so that \u2018social relations are \nembedded within the economic system\u2019) as well as by external regulation.  \nSo Callon errs in claiming that Polanyi notes only \u2018the existence of an institutional \nframe constituting the (sc. external) context in which economic activities take place\u2019 \n(1998: 8). This does serious disservice to the richness of his economic anthropology \nand studies of market economies. Polanyi also discusses problems posed by re-\nembedding the market economy so that it is socially controlled rather than left to the \nanarchic logic of laissez-faire (Polanyi 1944). This third level is also one where the \nRA and autopoietic theory have much to offer and, indeed, where they may conflict \nwith Polanyi's work (cf. Luhmann 1995; Glagow and Willke, 1987). Their key \ncontribution here lies in their account of how inter-systemic heterarchy involves \nproblems of material and social interdependence among operationally autonomous \n 16\n(or closed) functional systems, each with its own codes, programmes, institutional \nlogics, and interests in self-reproduction.  \n \nThis latter set of problems was addressed by Polanyi, who argued that the material \nand social interdependencies between economics, politics, and civil society cannot \nbe coordinated simply through the market mechanism. In particular, he noted the key \nrole of haute finance in the golden age of laissez-faire \u2018as the main link between the \npolitical and the economic organization of the world in this period \u2026 a permanent \nagency of the most elastic kind \u2026 the nucleus of one of the most complex \ninstitutions the history of man has produced\u2019 (Polanyi 1944: 10,11).16 The \nimportance of interpersonal relations to the governance of inter-organizational \nrelations is taken one stage higher here through the dependence of inter-systemic \nlinkages on inter-organizational relations. For not only did haute finance rest on an \ninterpersonal network with diasporic as well as national dimensions, it also depended \non a complex web of interorganizational relations that connected the different logics \nof the economic, political, and military systems on both national and international \nlevels. Indeed one could see Polanyi as a pioneering student of \u2018international \nregimes\u2019 as well as of \u2018national modes of regulation\u2019 as governance mechanisms in \nso far as he claimed that nineteenth-century civilization rested on the balance of \npower system, the international gold standard, the self-regulating market, and the \nliberal state (Polanyi 1944: 3). The first two of these are political and economic \nregimes of international scope, the latter two are structurally coupled and co-\ndependent governance mechanisms that are more national in scope. \n \nIn this sense, Polanyi developed a pre-theoretical understanding of the inherently \nspatio-temporal nature of (dis)embedding. His analysis of the four main pillars of \nnineteenth-century civilization identified a specific spatio-temporal fix based on the \nbalance of power system, the international gold standard, the self-regulating market, \nand the liberal state. This was appropriate to the golden age of laissez-faire and, as \nPolanyi notes, crises in any one of these pillars triggered counter-movements to limit \nthe damage caused by the market mechanism (see especially 1944: 208-19). \nRadical American economists from the \u2018social structure of accumulation\u2019 school, \nwhich is one of seven parallel traditions in the RA (see Kotz et al., 1994; and Jessop \n1990), also identify four pillars that stabilized postwar Atlantic Fordism, namely, a \n 17\ncapital-labour compromise, a capital-capital accord, a worker-citizen compromise, \nand an international settlement based on \u2018embedded liberalism\u2019 (e.g., Bowles et al., \n1983; on embedded liberalism, see also Keohane 1984). More recently I have \naddressed the problems involved in finding a new and appropriate spatio-temporal fix \nfor the globalizing post-Fordist economy as it undergoes a fresh round of neo-liberal \ndisembedding (Jessop 1999). Polanyi would easily recognize the destructive \nconsequences of the newly expanded freedom of disembedded capital to \u2018flow\u2019 freely \nthrough space and time. However, capital has also its own particular productive and \nreproductive needs that can only be materialized only in specific types of spatio-\ntemporal location and, as Polanyi might have argued, this provides a new round of \nopportunities for the \u2018double movement\u2019 to operate.  \n \nThe details of these different analyses are less important here than the more general \nrecognition that a key dimension of market relations is how they are disembedded \nfrom particular locales and time horizons and re-embedded in others. This can be \nconsidered from the double viewpoint of \u2018time-space distantiation\u2019 and \u2018time-space \ncompression\u2019. The former stretches social relations over time and space so that they \ncan be controlled or coordinated over longer periods of time (including into the ever \nmore distant future) and over longer distances, greater areas, or more scales.17 Its \nrelation to embedding is complicated in so far as the stretching of social relations \ntends both to disembed them from particular local contexts and to embed them in \nspatially more extensive interpersonal or inter-organizational networks of control. \nThis is reflected in more extensive spatial divisions of labour and\/or organizational \ncoordination. Time-space compression involves the intensification of \u2018discrete\u2019 events \nin real time18 and\/or increased velocity of materiel and immaterial flows over a given \ndistance. This also has an ambiguous relation to (dis)embedding processes. For \neven hypermobile financial capital which appears to operate in a space of flows \nrather than being tied to particular locales actually needs operational bases in global \ncities (or similar urban spaces) with appropriate and distinctive kinds of material, \nimmaterial, and social infrastructures (cf. Cox 1997; Sassen 1996).  \n \nGovernance and Meta-Governance as (Re)Embedding Mechanisms \n \n 18\nThese ambiguities in the spatio-temporal embedding of capital flows reflect a broader \nset of contradictions in capitalism. For, as Polanyi emphasized, the very process of \ncommodification induced by the spread of the market mechanism generates various \ncontradictions unresolvable through that mechanism. This point can be generalized \nby referring to Marx\u2019s analysis of the principal contradictions inscribed in the most \nbasic forms of the capitalist mode of production. Thus the commodity is both an \nexchange-value and a use-value; the worker is both abstract labour and a concrete \nindividual; the wage is both a cost of production and a source of demand; money is \nboth international currency and national money; productive capital is both abstract \nvalue in motion and a concrete stock of time- and place-specific assets in the course \nof being valorized; taxation is both a deduction from revenue and a source of \ndemand; and so on. These contradictions prove more or less manageable depending \non the specific \u2018spatio-temporal fixes\u2019 and the institutionalized class compromises \nwith which they are from time to time associated. It is in disrupting past fixes and \ncompromises without providing a new structured coherence for continued capital \naccumulation that neo-liberal forms of globalization appear to be so threatening to \nmany capitalist \u2013 let alone other \u2013 interests. \n \nThis raises a series of problems concerning market failure and crises. For example, \nwhen existing embedding and governance mechanisms failed in nineteenth-century \ncapitalism, including the central role of that heterarchic governance mechanism par \nexcellence materialized in haute finance, what happened next? Polanyi argues that \nthe state stepped in. He writes that \n \n\u2018In the last resort, impaired self-regulation of the market led to political \nintervention. When the trade cycle failed to come round and restore \nemployment, when imports failed to produce exports, when bank reserve \nregulations threatened business with a panic, when foreign debtors \nrefused to pay, governments had to respond to the strain. In an \nemergency the unity of society asserted itself through the medium of \nintervention\u2019 (Polanyi 1944: 206, cf. 207-8). \n \nThus Polanyi suggested that the historical record shows that markets work in the \nshadow of hierarchy \u2013 not only in the shadow of haute finance as a peak level \n 19\nheterarchic coordination mechanism but also in the shadow of the state, which would \nalways intervene in the last resort to protect society. But Polanyi was also well \naware, of course, of the limits to intervention. It is in this context that it is worth \nrevisiting the autopoieticists\u2019 idea of \u2018de-centred context steering\u2019. \n \nHaute finance can be seen as one mechanism of such steering. No doubt those \ninvolved took account of the operating codes and rationalities of the prevailing \neconomic and political systems as well as their various substantive, social, and \nspatio-temporal interdependencies. They would also have been concerned to \npromote mutual understanding between these systems (\u2018noise reduction\u2019) as well as \nto engage in negotiation, negative coordination, and positive cooperation in shared \nprojects. But they could not master all the structural contradictions nor manage all \nthe strategic dilemmas that were entailed in laissez-faire capitalism. Sooner or later \nthe state would be forced by social pressures (the counter-movement of society) to \nintervene. But in the current stage of capitalist development, with its far greater \nentangling of scales of economic and political action resulting from the complex \ndialectic of globalization-regionalization, even these last resort powers of the \nsovereign national state have been challenged. This points to the need for new and \neven more reflexive forms of meta-governance.  \n \nMeta-governance is concerned with the collibration of governance mechanisms, i.e., \nwith the overall organization and balancing of the different forms of coordination of \ncomplex reciprocal interdependence (on the idea of collibration, see Dunsire 1996). \nIn addition to meta-governance practices within the more or less separate fields of \nanarchic market exchange, hierarchical organizations, and heterarchic self-\norganization, there is also extensive scope for meta-governance practices that steer \nthe evolving relationship among these different modes of coordination. The latter are \nconcerned to provide the ground rules for governance, ensure the compatibility of \ndifferent governance mechanisms and regimes, deploy a relative monopoly of \norganizational intelligence and information with which to shape cognitive \nexpectations, act as a 'court of appeal' for disputes arising within and over \ngovernance, serve to re-balance power differentials by strengthening weaker parties \nor systems in the interests of system integration and\/or social cohesion, etc.. Thus it \ninvolves shaping the context within which governance arrangements are forged \n 20\nrather than developing specific strategies and initiatives for them. To the extent that \nthese practices are oriented to inserting the neo-liberal globalizing market economy \ninto a new cosmopolitan market society, they would provide the basis for that \u2018co-\nexistence\u2019 in market societies for which Polanyi argued and struggled (for further \ndiscussion of meta-governance, see Jessop 1998). \n  \nSome (All Too) Brief Concluding Remarks \n \nThe preceding remarks have discussed some convergencies and complementarities \nbetween Polanyi\u2019s institutionalism, the regulation approach, and autopoietic systems \ntheory. There are also display some basic differences. Thus Polanyi was strongly \ninterested in modes of distribution in pre-capitalist as well as in capitalist \neconomies.19 In contrast, regulationists have so far been mainly interested in \ndifferent forms of capitalism and give more weight to the specifically capitalist nature \nof the production process.20 Moreover, while regulationists share Polanyi\u2019s emphasis \non the wage relation and money form as defining features of capitalism, they show \nless interest in the commodification of \u2018land\u2019 (nature).21 Above all, they propose new \nand exciting ways to think about the economic and extra-economic conditions that \nhelp to secure an always provisional and unstable capitalist order. In this regard they \nhelp us to extend and refine Polanyi\u2019s analyses. Finally, systems theorists are more \ninterested in the overall evolution of societies so that their typology of economic \nsystems and account of the latter\u2019s evolution differ from Polanyi and the \nregulationists. They see modern economic systems as comprising formally free \nactivities oriented to 'profit-and-loss' and stress the mediating role of money and \nmarket forces. They are particularly insightful regarding the problems of regulation \nthat derive from the modern economy\u2019s simultaneous independence as an \noperationally autonomous system and its complex structural interdependence with \nother functional systems. In this regard they help us to understand the roots of \nPolanyi\u2019s \u2018double movement\u2019 in the system world as well as the lifeworld. And they \nalso offer useful suggestions on how the market economy could be governed so that \nit co-exists with, rather than threatens, other institutional orders.  \n \nIt is this combination of convergences, complementarities, and differences that has \nfacilitated the double-sided critique in this article. Thus I have tried not only to \n 21\ndisclose some weaknesses in Polanyi\u2019s analysis but also to show how his work can \nbe used to improve the other two accounts of modern economies. Four main \ninnovations have been suggested. First, I have offered a more detailed analysis of \nthe various forms and levels of social embeddedness and their interconnections. \nPolanyi\u2019s analysis of haute finance is particularly illuminating here. Second, I have \ngiven a more detailed analysis of the self-organizing logic of a market economy and \nits implications for the limits of intervention. Here I have drawn both on Marx\u2019s \nanalysis of the historical conditions of the self-valorization of capital within the circuit \nof capital and on the self-avowedly anti-Marxist arguments of autopoietic systems \ntheory.22 The former provides far better insights into the structural contradictions and \nstrategic dilemmas inscribed in capitalist market relations and thus into the inherent \nlimitations of the extension of the commodity form to labour-power, land, and money. \nThe latter offers a necessary corrective to the reductionist temptation in Marxist \ntheorizing to see the logic of the capitalist market economy as somehow determinant \n\u2018in the last instance\u2019 of an entire social formation. I have argued that Polanyi\u2019s \naccount of the dual movement is located at the intersection of these two approaches.  \n \nThird, I have provided a more detailed analysis of capitalist societalization \u2013 or the \nforms of what Polanyi called the market society \u2013 and of the mechanisms through \nwhich the logic of the market economy comes to dominate and hegemonize the \nwider society and the various forms and sites of resistance thereto. This is intended \nboth as a corrective to Marxist reductionism by specifying the various economic and \nextra-economic mechanisms through which a social formation could come to be \ndominated by the logic of capital; and as a way of revealing the richness of Polanyi\u2019s \nown reflections on the dialectics of the dual movement through which a market \neconomy first develops through its disembedding from pre-capitalist institutions and \nis then (re-)embedded in a market society. \n \nFourth, I have identified how the \u2018dual movement\u2019 that structurally couples the market \neconomy with other systems and the lifeworld can be subjected \u2013 always, of course, \nwithin certain limits \u2013 to appropriate forms of governance and meta-governance. In \nthis way the primary sources of society\u2019s counter-movement, i.e., the more extreme \nmanifestations of the formal rationality of market forces, can be tamed through the \nmore reflexive, dialogical rationality of governance. I believe this is one way in which \n 22\n 23\n                                           \nwe can rethink the possibilities of co-existence between the market economy and \nmarket society \u2013 an issue of interest to Polanyi in his more ethico-political writings. \n \n \nEndnotes \n \n1 This article derives from an oral presentation at the Sixth Karl Polanyi Conference, \nMontreal, October 1996. Its written version has benefited from the comments of \nFikret Adaman, Pat Devine, Marguerite Mendell, Klaus Nielsen, Gunnar Oloffson, \nseveral conference participants, and two anonymous referees for the present journal. \n2 The first, second, and fourth of these principles provide an interesting parallel with \nthe three main principles of governance: heterarchy or horizontal self-organization, \nimperative coordination through hierarchy, and the anarchy of market exchange. \n3 The Althusserian structural Marxist approach to pre-capitalist modes of production \nmakes much the same points about the complex articulation between the economic \nand extra-economic in constituting social relations of production, even noting the \nimportance of politics (for the ancient mode) and religion (for the feudal), but it also \ntries to explain this in terms of 'economic determination in the last instance' (i.e., in \nterms how surplus labour is appropriated in different epochs). For an otherwise \nlaudatory critique of Polanyi on the latter lines, see Godelier (1988). For \nrepresentative work, see Althusser and Balibar 1977; Cutler et al., 1977; and Terray \n1972. \n4 The Parisian regulationists acknowledge Polanyi\u2019s influence alongside that of Marx, \nKeynes, and Kalecki: see R.

For a useful (and, as far as I am aware, a \nunique) comparison of Polanyi\u2019s institutionalism and the early Parisian regulationist \nwork, see L. Mj\u00f8set (1985) \u2018Regulation and the Institutionalist Tradition\u2019, in L. Mj\u00f8set \nand J.

Orthodox economics theorizes this in terms of \u2018efficient breach of law\u2019. \n9 This claim goes beyond Marx\u2019s claim: \u2018[a]ccumulate, accumulate! That is Moses \nand the prophets!\u2019 (1867: 854). This expresses the viewpoint of the individual \ncapitalist to investment and consumption rather than to the need for the overall \norganization of society to adapt to the imperatives of capital accumulation. \n10 Accumulation can occur, of course, where capitalist and non-capitalist relations co-\nexist as in the phase of primitive accumulation or slavery in the Deep South. This \nreinforces my argument that accumulation need not entail the dominance of \naccumulation as the primary principle of societalization. \n11 Polanyi, Great Transformation, pp. 68-9. \n12 Polanyi interpreted fascism as a totalitarian attempt to subordinate an entire \nsociety to the logic of the market in the interests of the proprietors and gave an \ninteresting analysis of the anti-universalist ideology of \u2018blood and race\u2019, the neo-\nfeudal economic structures, and the political matrix in which this occurred (Polanyi \n1972). For a useful discussion, based on the Polanyi archive, see Maucourant (2000: \n139-42). \n13 Oloffson offers a similar threefold analysis of Polanyi\u2019s work on embeddedness. \nHe suggests that \u2018Polanyi\u2019s concept can be defined \u2026 as a combination of three sets \nof linkages: (a) connections between economic and non-economic institutions (or \nparts of societies) on the macro-level; (b) relations between actors and institutions on \nthe levels of social relations (cf. the contribution of Granovetter); (c) a second-order \nsystematic linking of these two sets of connections (a macro-micro link)\u2019 (1995: 74). \nMy own account of the three levels rests on general reflections on implications of the \nthree theoretical approaches considered in this article (see Jessop 1997b). \n14 Swedberg (1997: 165) has argued that \u2018[w]hereas Karl Polanyi \u2026 introduced the \nnotion of embeddedness to emphasize that the economy was an organic part of \n 24\n                                                                                                                                        \nsociety in pre-capitalist times, Granovetter\u2019s point was nearly the opposite, namely to \nshow that economic actions are truly social actions in capitalist society\u2019 (165). This \nclaim is misleading because it conflates the first and second levels of embeddedness \nthat are distinguished here. \n15 Swedberg (1997: 171) claims that Polanyi used the term \u2018embeddedness\u2019 only \ntwice in a casual manner in The Great Transformation and only gave it a \u2018half-\nhearted\u2019 theoretical status in his comments on the economy as an instituted process. \nThis claim is doubly misleading: first, it mistakes words and concepts; and, second, it \nignores the critical distinction between the substantive and formal concepts of the \neconomy in Polanyi\u2019s work, which is dependent in turn on the distinction between an \nembedded economy and an institutionally separate economic system. On the first \npoint, Oloffson has shown that Polanyi uses various words to describe \nembeddedness in The Great Transformation, including \u2018submerged\u2019, \u2018enmesh\u2019, \n\u2018intertwined\u2019, \u2018absorbed in\u2019, \u2018accessories of\u2019, \u2018compatible with\u2019, \u2018embodied in\u2019, \n\u2018accessory feature of\u2019, \u2018formed part of\u2019, and \u2018subordination\u2019. He adds that \u2018[a]ll these \ndifferent expressions are either linguistic varieties of the same concept (i.e., \nembeddedness) or they take up partly different specialized meanings of the general \nconcept\u2019 (Oloffson 1995: 86). On the second point, this critical distinction is \ndeveloped most fully \u2013 and certainly not \u2018half-heartedly\u2019 \u2013 in Polanyi\u2019s posthumously \npublished synthesis of his life\u2019s work (Polanyi 1977). \n16 For a Polanyian account of the role of haute finance in contemporary capitalism, \nsee E. Helleiner (2000) \u2018Globalization and haute finance -- d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\u2019, in K. McRobbie \nand Kari Polanyi Levitt, eds, Karl Polanyi in Vienna. The Contemporary Significance \nof \u2018The Great Transformation\u2019, Montreal: Black Rose Press, **. \n17 Time-space distantiation can also anchor present action to the past through the \n'politics of memory' and\/or organizational techniques such as written records. See \nGiddens 1984. \n18 This can occur either by reducing the time it takes to produce a given \u2018event\u2019 or by \nincreasing the ability to discriminate more steps in an \u2018event\u2019, thereby enhancing \nopportunities to modify its course or outcome by intervening as the event happens. \n19 Luhmann does consider pre-capitalist economies in terms of their lack of \nfunctional differentiation from other systems and their organization in terms of \nsegmentary or centre-periphery relations (1986, 1995). And, although the RA has \n 25\n 26\n                                                                                                                                        \nshown little interest in pre-capitalist economic formations, Polanyi\u2019s account shows \nstrong similarities to that in Marx\u2019s notebooks on this important topic (Marx 1980). \n20 At best Polanyi refers to the key role of mechanization in creating the conditions for \nthe extension of the commodity form to land and labour-power. See Polanyi, Great \nTransformation, pp. 00-00. It is also worth noting that regulationists have considered \ndistribution under the rubric of the differential articulation of forms of production and \nconsumption in different accumulation regimes. In this sense distribution re-enters \nRA analyses as an effect of different linkages between production and consumption \nor as an effect of a broader institutionalised compromise that helps to sustain \n(reproduce, regularise) specific accumulation regimes. \n21 The principal exception here is Alain Lipietz, whose early work was concerned with \nland and rent and who has more recently developed a regulationist approach to \npolitical ecology. See, for example, A. Lipietz (1994) Green Hopes: the Foundations \nof Political Ecology, Cambridge: Polity. \n22 Luhmann argues that Marxism is a pre-modern theory because it assumes that \none system (in this case, the economy) can occupy the central position in society. In \ncontrast, he argues that modern society is characterized by de-centred functional \ndifferentiation rather than a hierarchical ordering of different institutional orders \n(Luhmann 1995). \nReferences \n \nAlthusser, L. and Balibar, E.
