These can be compounded when key variables are inadequately represented. Land surface temperature (LST) is critical as it forms an integral component in the surface energy budget, water stress evaluation, fuel moisture derivation, and soil moisture\u2013climate feedbacks. A reduction in the uncertainty of surface energy fluxes, and moisture quantification, is assumed to be achievable by constraining simulations of LST with observation data. This technique is known as data assimilation and involves the adjustment of the model state at observation times with measurements of a predictable uncertainty.

Introduction \n \nLand surface models are mathematical representations of the biophysical processes that \nconstitute the terrestrial biosphere. They are crucial elements of General Circulation Models \n(GCMs), since they determine the surface radiative properties and the surface to atmosphere \nfluxes of heat, water and carbon; influencing cloud cover, precipitation, and atmospheric \nchemistry. However, much variation exists in their parameterization, representation of \nbiophysical processes, and as a result of the heterogeneity of the land surface; leading to \nuncertainty in how climate change influences the terrestrial biosphere, and how the land \nsurface may evolve in the future. Improvements can be made by integrating additional data \ninto these models; a technique known as data assimilation. While field measurements can \nprovide accurate constraints to models, their limited geographical extent reduces their \neffectiveness, whereas remotely sensed data from Earth Observation (EO) satellites can \novercome this limitation thereby providing the most realistic source of data at appropriately \nfine temporal resolution over large geographical regions. \nData assimilation involves adjusting the model state with external measurements of \nestablished uncertainty at regular intervals. With the inherent uncertainty in model \npredictions, data assimilation represents a process of minimizing the errors in the model \nphysics through the updating of the model state variables at each time step when observations \nbecome available. Both the model uncertainty and the observation uncertainty play \nsignificant roles in the determination of the correction to be applied to the state variable. \nWhere the observation data values are more reliable the model estimates are adjusted to more \nclosely correspond to these observations. \nSeveral assimilation techniques exist, including the three-dimensional variational \n(3DVAR) scheme, and the Kalman Filter method and its variants. The difference between \nthese is in the evolution of the error structure, and the methodology for solving the analysis \nupdate equation. The Kalman Filter provides the optimum linear sequential assimilation \nsolution based on model and observation uncertainties [Gelb, 1974], and is designed to apply \nthis prior knowledge of the uncertainties to achieve the optimum correction to be applied to \nthe model estimation. To cope with non-linear assimilation a variant called the Extended \nKalman Filter (EKF) was developed. An alternative to this is the Ensemble Kalman Filter \n(EnKF) [Evensen, 2003], which employs a Monte Carlo approach to avoid the \ncomputationally expensive integration of the state error covariance matrix; and compared \nwith the EKF is more robust and flexible in covariance modeling [Reichle et al., 2002].  \nPrevious implementations of the EnKF have indicated this technique to be a beneficial \nsolution for updating state variables with observation measurements. For instance, Huang et \nal. [2008] reported a 1 K improvement in the estimates of soil temperature when satellite land \nsurface temperature (LST) products were assimilated at observation times. Quaife et al. \n[2008] assimilated canopy reflectance into a simple carbon pool and box model, and found \nsignificant improvements in the estimation of gross primary production. Pipunic et al. [2008] \nassimilated LST products, and both latent heat and sensible heat products. They found \npredictions of latent and sensible heat were improved under both assimilation scenarios. \nFurthermore, they found that assimilation of higher temporal source data resulted in \nimproved predictions compared with lower temporal source data. \nIn this study, we investigated the feasibility of assimilating LST into the JULES (Joint UK \nLand Environment Simulator) land-surface model, which is the community version of the UK \nMet Office\u201fs MOSES (Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme) scheme. Although simulations \nfrom land-surface models may well be reasonably representative of real values, during long \nmodeling runs considerable deviation can result [Huang et al., 2008]. Constraining these \nsimulations with observation data is therefore a desirable objective.  \n LST is the radiative skin temperature of the land. It is derived from solar radiation and \ninfluences the partitioning of energy into ground, sensible, and latent heat fluxes. Being an \nimportant component of the surface energy budget it is therefore of significant value in \nvalidating and constraining land surface models. It is influenced by various surface-\natmosphere boundary conditions, such as albedo, and precipitation [Huang et al., 2008]; and \nis more closely related to the physiological activities of leaves than air temperature [Sims et \nal., 2008]. Furthermore, differences between the air temperature and surface temperature of \ndry ground can be as much as 20\u00b0C [Byrne, 1979]. \nThe importance of LST in applications such as vegetation water stress monitoring, as a \nresult of its close relationship to vapor pressure deficit [Hashimoto et al., 2008]; and surface \nenergy balance assessment [Pinheiro et al., 2006], is well documented. Additionally, LST has \nan important role to play in the fire regime. It has been argued in previous studies [Sandholt \net al., 2002; Snyder et al., 2006] that the ratio between the Normalized Difference Vegetation \nIndex (NDVI) and LST can be expressed as a surface dryness index representing live fuel \nmoisture content (FMC), which is a critical variable in the prediction of fire occurrence and \npropagation. \nA primary use of LST data derived from EO satellites has been in the validation \/ \ncalibration of other LST data sets [Noyes et al., 2006; Trigo et al., 2008a]. However, maybe \nin recognition of the important role LST has to play in land surface modeling, much recent \nwork with satellite derived LST data has focused on this data being used as the source of \nobservations to constrain models. Numerous studies have investigated the use of LST \nobservations from satellite in model simulations. Bosilovich et al., [2007] for example, \nemployed the 3DVAR assimilation method to assimilate LST into the National Center for \nAtmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Land Model. Margulis and Entekhabi [2003] \nalso used a variational assimilation technique to optimize the water and energy budgets of a \n1-D model. As for LST validation studies, both Ge et al. [2008] and Jin et al. [1997] \ncompared land-surface model LST simulations with remote sensing observations. These \nstudies illustrated the importance of LST in the surface energy balance representation in \nbiophysical models, and argued how improvements can be made with the utilization of \nsatellite observations. A similar study involving JULES is thus a valuable objective. This \nstudy however, is the first to both attempt to validate the simulation of LST from a land \nsurface model with satellite derived LST data from multiple sources, and to assimilate the \nmost spatially and temporally appropriate product into the model using a sequential \nassimilation method, such as the EnKF. The ultimate aim of this study is to investigate the \nimpact of a better representation of LST in the land surface model both on surface energy \nfluxes and biogeochemical cycles. \nWhereas many previous assimilation studies have successfully improved the estimations \nfrom simple biosphere models, few such as the assimilation of NDVI data into the \nORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems Environment) land \nsurface model [Vivoy et al., 2001] have attempted to integrate satellite data into more \ncomplex biophysical and biogeochemical models. The current study represents a first \ninvestigation at sequential assimilation with the EnKF into the land-surface model employed \nwithin the UK Met Office\u201fs Unified Modeling System. This paper will describe this land \nsurface model and the assimilation methodology applied (section 2); and will present the \nresults of the intercomparison of the model with remote sensing products, and of the \nassimilation of the observations into the model (section 3). Potential deficiencies in the \nexisting state variable estimation will be discussed and improvements through assimilation \nwill be analyzed (section 4). \n \n2. Materials and methods \n 2.1. Model description \n \nJULES is based on the MOSES system, which was developed to calculate the surface-to-\natmosphere fluxes of heat and water when coupled to the Hadley Centre\u201fs General \nCirculation Model (GCM), and is described in detail by Cox et al. [1999]. It is a terrestrial \ngrid box model driven by meteorological data and features a fine temporal resolution to \ncharacterize the diurnal cycle, updating the state variables at intervals typically of 30 or 60 \nminutes. Additionally, it is coupled to a dynamic global vegetation model called TRIFFID \n(Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics) which \nadopts a heuristic modeling approach for determining vegetation distribution and carbon \nstorage. A feature of the model is that for the duration of the model run biophysical \nparameters remain constant. \nEach grid box is represented as a composite of nine surface \u201ctiles\u201d. These consist of five \nplant functional types (PFTs): broadleaf trees, needleleaf trees, C3 grasses, C4 grasses, and \nshrubs; and four non-vegetation types: urban, inland water, bare soil and ice. The subsurface \nof each grid box is profiled into four soil layers, with each layer homogeneous within a grid \nbox. Soil thermal characteristics are functions of soil moisture, with diffusive heat exchanges \nbetween layers. Using the mean heat and water fluxes over the time step, prognostic soil \nfields are updated from values for the previous time step [Cox et al., 1999; Smith et al., \n2006]. Dynamic vegetation structure is simulated as the density of carbon and fractional \ncover of the five PFTs, with modified Lotka-Volterra equations determining competitive \nadvantages between PFTs as described by Hughes et al. [2006]. \n Unlike single-source models, which can produce model errors in their predictions of \nsurface heat fluxes in mixed canopy \/ soil surfaces [Kustas and Norman, 1999], JULES \nexplicitly treats the energy exchanges between each tile and the overlying atmosphere; with \nthe surface energy balance equation for each tile, as defined by Cox et al. [1999], given by:  \n \nSWN + LW\u2193 - \u03c3Ts\n4\n = H + LE + G0      (1) \n \nWhere Ts is the surface temperature, \u03c3 is the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant, SWN is the net \ndownward short wave radiation derived from the surface albedo, LW\u2193 is the downward long \nwave radiation, H is the sensible heat flux, LE is the latent heat flux, and G0 is the heat flux \ninto the ground. The grid box LST is a sum of the surface temperatures of each tile multiplied \nby their respective fractional covers within the grid box. \nThe surface temperature Ts is a critical variable in the derivation of sensible heat flux H \n(equation (2)), and latent heat flux LE (equation (3)). The sensible heat flux is calculated \nusing the temperature gradient between the surface and reference height z1 above the surface: \n \nH = \n\u03c1cp ( Ts  \u2013  T1  - \ng \nz1 ) (2) ra cp \n \nWhere \u03c1 is the surface air density, cp is the specific heat capacity of the air, ra is the \naerodynamic resistance, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and T1 is the air temperature at \nreference height z1. The latent heat flux is similarly derived using the humidity gradient \nbetween the surface and atmospheric reference height z1: \n \nLE = \u03a8 \nL\u03c1 \n( qsat(Ts)  \u2013  q1 ) (3) ra \n \nWhereby LE is driven by evapotranspiration (ET), with \u03c8 being a factor determined from the \nproportions of canopy evaporation, bare soil evaporation, transpiration by vegetation, and \nsublimation from snow. L is the latent heat of vaporization of water, qsat(Ts) is the saturated \nspecific humidity at surface temperature Ts, and q1 is the specific humidity at reference height \nz1. Within the soil hydrology component of the model, total unfrozen soil moisture content M \nwithin each layer is given by equation (4), in which the surface soil moisture is incremented \naccording to equation (5): \n \nM = \u03c1w\u0394z\u0398u         (4) \n \ndM1 \n= Pf + Sm \u2013 Ys \u2013 W1 \u2013 \u03c1 (1 - fa){qsat(Ts)  \u2013  q1} { \n (1 \u2013 v) \u03b2(\u03981) \n +  \ne1 v } (5) dt ra + rss ra + rc \n \nWhere \u03c1w is the density of water, \u0394z is the depth of the soil layer, and \u0398u is the volumetric \nconcentration of unfrozen soil moisture. Pf is the throughfall precipitation, Sm is snowmelt, Ys \nis surface runoff, W1 is the diffusive water flux flowing out to the layer below, fa is the wet \ncanopy fraction of the grid box, v is the vegetated fraction of the grid box, \u03b2(\u03981) is the soil \nmoisture availability factor with volumetric soil moisture concentration \u03981 in the top soil \nlayer, e1 is the fraction of the transpiration extracted from the top soil layer; and rss and rc are \na fixed soil surface resistance and the canopy resistance respectively. For more \ncomprehensive detail regarding the soil thermodynamic and hydrology components of the \nmodel, these are described in Cox et al. [1999]. \n \n2.2. Study area \n \nFor this investigation the study region was Africa, chosen in order to assess the benefits \nof LST assimilation over a large geographical area at a fine temporal resolution. Africa has a \nstrong wet and dry seasonality, and is an important component in the global carbon cycle; yet \nthis continent remains the least studied [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007], \neven though climate scenarios for Africa remain highly uncertain [Williams et al., 2007]. \nDuring the 20\nth\n Century Africa experienced an overall warming. With warming expected to \naccelerate here in most scenarios [Hulme et al., 2001], improved quantification of the surface \nto atmosphere heat and water fluxes through data assimilation offers the prospect of \nimproving confidence in climate predictions for this region. Furthermore, the simulation of \nrealistic fire disturbance regimes with biophysical and biogeochemical models, by applying \nimproved estimations of FMC, is a prerequisite for reducing the uncertainty of the African \ncarbon cycle. Since the observation network around Africa is relatively sparse only EO data \nrepresents a feasible option for constraining model estimates. \n \n2.3. Experimental setup \n \nFor this study, JULES version 2.1 was run at an hourly time step at 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 spatial \nresolution. Meteorological input data were taken from 6-hourly National Centers for \nEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data sets [Kalnay et al., 1996]. However, \ncaution has been advocated in the use of NCEP precipitation data [Ichii et al., 2005], so \ncalibration with monthly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data \n[Kummerow et al., 1998] was therefore applied according to the method used by Sheffield et \nal. [2006] and Weber et al. [2009], in which the 6-hourly NCEP values are scaled to match \nthe monthly TRMM values as follows:  \n \nCalibrated NCEP6hr  = \nTRMMmonthly \n\u00d7  NCEP6hr (6) \nNCEPmonthly \n \nLand cover change was not considered in this experiment, since the duration of the model run \nwas too short to trigger significant vegetation-climate feedbacks as a result of changes to \nvegetation distribution. The geographical distribution of the JULES tiles was therefore \ndetermined from the seventeen International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land-\ncover classes, which are available in a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 gridded file from the International Satellite \nLand Surface Climatology (ISLSCP) Initiative II data collection, by applying the linear \nmapping algorithm of Dunderdale et al. [1999], rather than being simulated by TRIFFID. \nJULES was spun-up until the soil thermal and hydrologic properties, and the modeled carbon \ncycle, were equilibrated with the climate forcing. This equilibrium state is used as the initial \ncondition for the main run, and limits anomalous responses at the beginning of the \nsimulation. \nLST simulated by JULES was compared during March, June, September and December \n2006 with three widely used thermal satellite products: the advanced along-track scanning \nradiometer (AATSR); the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS); and the \nspinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI). The choice of four distinct months \nenabled any seasonal effects to be highlighted. For comparison, each satellite product was re-\nprojected onto a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grid for the African continent, as dictated by the resolution of the \nmodel forcing data, by averaging within each grid box all geo-referenced, cloud free pixels, \nwhere the respective quality flags were of the highest rank. \n This intercomparison experiment was carried out for two different parameterizations of \nthe model. First, a standard parameterization (denoted as model A), where soil parameters are \nderived from the global vegetation and soils data set of Wilson and Henderson-Sellers [1985]. \nSecond, a modified parameterization (denoted as model B), where soil parameters are derived \nfrom the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) II soil data set \n[Global Soil Data Task, 2000]; with soil albedo from the data set of Houldcroft et al. [2009]. \nThe assimilation experiment involved SEVIRI observations being assimilated into the most \nappropriate parameterization of JULES for a full year. This choice of EO product was made \nbased on the correspondingly fine temporal resolution of both model and satellite product. \n \n2.4. Remote sensing data \n \nSEVIRI acquires an image every 15 minutes, at a spatial resolution of between 3km and \n5km for the African continent, and is the main payload on board the Meteosat Second \nGeneration (MSG) geostationary satellites centered over the equator. A split-window \nalgorithm for channels IR10.8 and IR12.0 is used to process LST data at an accuracy of 1.5 K \n[Sobrino and Romaguera, 2004] for most simulations between nadir and 50\u00b0 viewing zenith \nangle. LST retrieval requires identification of cloudy \/ part cloudy pixels since clouds scatter \nand absorb IR radiance. The Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis \n(LandSAF), whom generate and disseminate SEVIRI data, identify clear sky pixels through \nthe application of a cloud mask which makes use of software developed by the Nowcasting \nand Very Short-Range Forecasting Satellite Application (NWC SAF; http:\/\/nwcsaf.inm.es). \nThis information is delivered in quality flags; and for this study, only pixels identified as \ncloud-free was used. A complete description of the LandSAF algorithm for LST retrievals \ncan be found in the product user manual (available at the LandSAF web site \nhttp:\/\/landsaf.meteo.pt\/). \nIn this study, we used version 4 of the global MODIS LST product MOD11A1, which is \nacquired from thermal IR sensors on board the sun-synchronous, near-polar orbiting satellite \nTerra at a spatial resolution of 1km. LST data is processed using a generalized split-window \nalgorithm for bands 31 and 32 at an accuracy better than 1.0 K [Wan et al., 2004; Wan, \n2008]. The large swath width of 2330km allows data to be acquired for the African continent \ntwice daily. A limitation of MODIS LST data is cloud-contamination. MODIS LST data is \naccompanied by quality control flags; to minimize cloud contamination only pixels with the \nhighest quality control flags were used. \nThe swath width of the AATSR sensor on board the sun-synchronous, polar orbiting \nsatellite Envisat is 512km, with global coverage every three days and a repeat orbit of 35 \ndays. Furthermore, measurements are available at two viewing angles, forward and nadir. For \nthe purpose of LST studies however, only measurements from the nadir view, data set \nATS_NR_2P, with a spatial resolution of 1km are available. The uncertainty reported by Coll \net al. [2005] for AATSR observations at nadir is less than 0.9 K. Cloud identification is \nperformed by the AATSR processor which identifies cloud affected pixels by applying a \nseries of tests to the brightness temperature. If any test indicates the presence of clouds then \nthis information is stored in the accompanying confidence flags. Full details of the LST \nretrieval algorithm can be found in the product user manual (available at the Envisat web site \nhttp:\/\/envisat.esa.int\/). \n \n2.5. LST intercomparison \n \nFor the intercomparison exercise observations over Africa were grouped as \u201cday\u201d \n(approximately 07:00 - 12:00 UTC); and \u201cnight\u201d (approximately 19:00 - 24:00 UTC) to \ncorrespond with the Terra MODIS orbital overpass times. Variability of LST over brief \ntemporal periods ensures validation of LST products is a challenging undertaking [Pinheiro \net al., 2006]. As stated in section 2.3., to account for the spatial variability satellite images \nwere resampled to a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grid to correspond with the JULES output. As for the temporal \nvariability in the different sources, intercomparison between the modeled values and the \nsatellite products was performed at individual 1\u00b0 grid boxes only at a JULES time step when \nthis corresponded both with a MODIS overpass time and with an AATSR overpass time - \nspecifically when both these satellite images were classified as cloud-free - within a \u00b110 \nminute time window; and when the closest 15-minute SEVIRI retrieval also resulted in \ncloud-free images. The monthly composites for the entire continent are an aggregation of all \nthe individual grid box comparisons carried out over the course of the month. First, the \nstandard soil parameterization of JULES (model A) was run for each of the months of March, \nJune, September, and December 2006 and compared with each of the EO products. Finally, \nthis experiment was repeated under the modified soil parameterization (model B). \n  \n2.6. Data assimilation \n \nAssimilation was carried out with the EnKF, which uses a Monte Carlo approach, and is a \nvariant of the Kalman Filter sequential assimilation method. The EnKF, first proposed by \nEvensen [1994], propagates an ensemble of states from which the state error covariance \nmatrix can be determined from the distribution of the ensemble spread. The expensive \nintegration of the state error covariance matrix is therefore avoided. In our data assimilation \nscheme, only LST is directly manipulated, where  the state vector Xt+1 representing LST in all \n2548 independent grid boxes at time t+1 is defined as: \n \nXt+1 = F (Xt, \u03b1t+1, \u03b2)       (7) \n \nWhere F is the model operator which in this case is JULES, and which operates on the state \nvariable at time t, the meteorological forcing data (air temperature, downward long-wave \nradiation, downward short-wave radiation, precipitation, specific humidity, and surface \npressure) at t+1 represented by \u03b1t+1, and the time-invariant model parameters represented by \n\u03b2.  \nStarting from time t=0, which is the initial state following model spin-up, each \nensemble member of the forecast state vector X\nf\nt+1 at time t+1 is propagated by adding \nstochastic forcing \u03b3 to equation (7) and is expressed as: \n \nX\nf\nt+1 = F (X\na\nt, \u03b1t+1, \u03b2) + \u03b3  \u03b3 ~ \u039d (0, P)    (8) \n \nWhere X\na\nt is the analysis state vector at time t. \u03b3 conforms to a Gaussian distribution with \nmean of zero and model error covariance P. In the case of the initial condition of the \nassimilation run (t=0), each ensemble member of the state vector X\na\n0 is derived by adding \nrandom noise based on our knowledge of the model error which conforms to a Gaussian \ndistribution with mean of zero and error covariance P0. The model error strongly influences \ndata assimilation performance; here model error was based on the standard deviation of the \nbias between the model simulations and in situ observations taken from a prior field \ncampaign to the site of the Skukuza Eddy Covariance Tower in the Kruger National Park, \nSouth Africa, during July and August of 2009. From this field data the mean model error was \ndefined as 3.6 K. When observations for a grid box become available each ensemble member \nof the forecast state for that grid box is then updated by applying the update equation defined \nby Evensen [2003]: \n \nX\na\n = X\nf\n + K (y \u2013 HXf + \u03b5)  \u03b5 ~ \u039d (0, R)    (9) \n \nWhere K is the Kalman gain matrix, which determines the correction to the forecast state X\nf\n \nof the grid box, and is a function of the model error covariance matrix P, and observation \nerror covariance matrix R: \n \nK = P\nf \nH\nT \n[ H P\nf \nH\nT\n + R ]\n-1\n       (10) \n \nH in equations (9) and (10) is the observation operator, which relates the model state \nvariables to the observations. The observation y is perturbed with stochastic forcing \u03b5 \nconforming to a Gaussian distribution with mean of zero and model error covariance R. For \nthe LST observations, the product uncertainty for SEVIRI measurements is used to determine \nits error range. In this case, the product uncertainty is defined as 1.5 K [Sobrino and \nRomaguera, 2004], which is comparable to the observation error of 1.6 K recorded during the \nfield campaign to the site of the Skukuza Eddy Covariance Tower during July and August of \n2009. \nEquation 10 is traditionally solved by eigenvalue decomposition, whereby the cost of \ndecomposition is a function of the ensemble size. The optimum number of ensemble \nmembers should therefore be determined for applying this method with minimal \ncomputational cost. The optimum estimate of the model state can be taken as the mean of the \nensemble members [Burgers et al., 1998; Evensen, 2003], with the variance around the mean \na reflection of the uncertainty. As indicated in equations (2) to (5), LST (Ts) is a key variable \nfor determining heat and water fluxes. The manipulations to LST carried out within our data \nassimilation scheme are propagated throughout the model structure affecting sensible and \nlatent heat fluxes, and soil moisture. \nAssimilation was carried out using JULES (model B) over the duration of 2007. The \nresultant LST Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) were compared against the MODIS LST \ndata set, since this can provide a context for an evaluation of the JULES model. Additionally, \nmodeled estimates of surface soil moisture produced by JULES, with and without the \nassimilation of LST data, were compared with a surface soil moisture (SSM) dataset derived \nat the Institute of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing at the Vienna University of \nTechnology, from radar backscattering coefficients produced from the active C-band (5.6 \nGHz) microwave scatterometer instruments on board the European Remote Sensing Satellites \n(ERS-1 and ERS-2). In our study, comparison between the model and the SSM dataset was \nperformed over an area of West Africa (15\u00b0W to 10\u00b0E longitude, 5\u00b0N to 20\u00b0N latitude) from \n1\nst\n January \u2013 31st May 2007. The SSM \u201eobservations\u201f are generated from two separate ERS \nreceiving stations (Maspalomas, and Matera) covering this region of Africa. \nA detailed description of the change detection method for SSM retrieval is given in \nWagner et al. [1999], but briefly, scatterometer estimates are used to model the incidence \nangle dependency of the radar backscattering coefficients, which are normalized to a 40\u00b0 \nreference incidence angle. The relative SSM data, which ranges from 0% to 100%, are \nderived from the normalized coefficients, which are scaled between the driest and wettest \nobservations over the long-term. Validation studies of the ERS scatterometer SSM dataset \nhave been undertaken by Wagner et al. [1999], who compared the dataset with gravimetric \nsoil moisture measurements over Ukrainian field sites; and by Ceballos et al. [2005], who \ncompared the dataset with soil moisture from a network of 20 stations in western Spain. \nThese studies recorded mean correlations of 0.41 and 0.75 respectively in the top 100cm soil \nprofile. Furthermore in their study, Ceballos et al. [2005] recorded a RMSE of 2.2% between \nthe scatterometer data and the average soil moisture. Additionally, it has been shown there is \ngood agreement between the SSM dataset and other soil moisture datasets in temperate, \ntropical and dry climates [Crow and Zhan, 2007; Pellarin et al., 2006; Wagner et al., 2003]. \nIn situ validation of the results was performed by analyzing the RMSEs of sensible (H) \nand latent heat (LE) fluxes, from both open loop modeling and following assimilation of \nLST, when compared with Eddy Covariance measurements [Papale et al., 2006]. These in \nsitu measurements were obtained for a three month period, October to December 2007, from \nfour African sites: the Skukuza flux tower (25.02\u00ba S, 31.50\u00ba E) in South Africa, situated in \nsemi-arid savanna; the Mongu flux tower (15.44\u00ba S, 23.25\u00ba E) in Zambia, located in Miombo \nwoodland; the Tchizalamou flux tower (4.29\u00ba S, 11.66\u00ba E) in the Congo, within a tropical \nsavanna; and the Demokeya flux tower (13.28\u00ba N, 30.48\u00ba E) situated in a savanna\/grassland \narea of the Sudan. \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1. LST Intercomparison \n \n Figure 1 shows both the SEVIRI daytime LST composite for the month of March 2006 \nand the difference between this nominal reference and both JULES (model A) and other \nsatellite products. Since the composites are based on temporal retrievals when all four LST \nsources intersect within \u00b110 minute tolerance windows, the image gaps are a result of \ninsufficient intersecting observations available to be able to construct a monthly composite. \nAATSR was found to be the remote sensing product with the highest mean temperatures, as \nwell as displaying the largest standard deviation. MODIS was the product with the lowest \nmean temperatures, with the viewing angle generating noticeable effects (Figure 2); as the \nviewing angle increased the bias between SEVIRI and MODIS also increased. There is a \ngeneral agreement between these findings and those of previous intercomparison studies. For \ninstance, Trigo et al. [2008a] reported SEVIRI to systematically record higher surface \ntemperatures than the MODIS product over Central Africa and the Iberian peninsula; and \nNoyes et al. [2006] found a similar tendency across ten sites in Europe and North Africa. This \nlatter study also found AATSR to generate the highest mean LST of these products. The \nsmaller range of view zenith angles for AATSR, compared with MODIS, means fewer pixels \nare affected by shadow and non-direct sunlight, resulting in a tendency to retrieve higher \ntemperatures. \nLarger MODIS viewing angles were found to correspond with the largest daytime \ndiscrepancies in agreement with Trigo et al. [2008a]; a result one can reasonably assume to \nbe a product of differential heating rates between sunlit and shadow scenes, whereas the \nSEVIRI geometry observes predominantly sunlit scenes. All three products displayed similar \ndiurnal ranges, as reported in these two aforementioned studies. In the study of the Senegal \nRiver region by Stisen et al. [2007] however, the SEVIRI diurnal range was systematically \nlarger than that of MODIS; a result that should warrant further investigation. \nLST simulated by model A is cooler than any of the satellite products (Table 1), with \nlarge negative biases occurring both during the day and the night. When each IGBP land \ncover class was analyzed, it was found that the bias was most pronounced over barren or \nsparsely vegetated grid boxes. Results from the comparison during September produced the \nmost striking differences between the modeled LST and the remote sensing products. One \npossible cause of this was an underestimation in the contribution of the bare soil tile LST to \nthe grid box aggregate. Grid box LST in JULES is a linear combination of the associated tile \nLSTs and their corresponding fractional covers. However, in a two-source model surface \ntemperature is defined as the fourth root of the aggregation of the fourth power of both soil \nand canopy LSTs multiplied by their corresponding fractional covers [Norman et al., 1995; Li \net al., 2005]. Experimentation reveals only minimal improvement if the linear grid box \naveraging in JULES is substituted with this non-linear approach; the largest adjustments \nbeing less than 0.1K, with these occurring in the savanna regions of the continent. Moreover, \nthe barren or sparsely vegetated grid boxes consist almost exclusively of single tile \ncomponents, whereby both aggregation methods produce the same LST. \nAlthough model representation of the average grid box LST could be a potential \nexplanatory factor for a proportion of the bias where multiple tile fractions exist within a grid \nbox, it was instead suspected that the prime candidate for model underestimation with respect \nto the remotely sensed LST was most likely to be the parameterization of the soil conditions. \nIn order to investigate this further an alternative parameterization was experimented with \n(model B). This encompassed the use of the 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 gridded data set of soil characteristics \nproduced by ISLSCP II project [Global Soil Data Task, 2000] from the IGBP Data and \nInformation System soil data set; and the soil albedo data set produced by the University of \nSwansea [Houldcroft et al., 2009]. Warmer signatures were obtained over much of the \ncontinent during March 2006 (Figure 3a), and resulted in a reduction in the mean monthly \n\u201cdaytime\u201d continental bias between modeled LST and SEVIRI, from -5.39 K to -5.05 K; with \nthe reduction being -8.87 K to -4.48 K for barren or sparsely vegetated grid boxes. The \ncorresponding reduction during the \u201cnight\u201d was -5.45 to -3.62 over the continent; and -7.62 to \n-5.59 over barren or sparsely vegetated grid boxes. It is the combination of the soil \ncharacteristics, such as soil moisture content and soil albedo (Figure 3b), which are \nresponsible for the reduced bias between modeled LST from model B and SEVIRI LST. This \nexperiment was repeated for June, September, and December 2006 with consistent reductions \nin bias achieved (Table 2). In spite of these reductions a residual bias still existed between \nmodel B and the SEVIRI product. In an assimilation system, such as the EnKF, a residual \nbias between the model and the observations prevents a statistically optimal analysis [Dee \nand da Silva, 1998]. The bias correction methodology of Reichle and Koster [2004] was \ntherefore employed, in which the cumulative distribution functions (cdf) of the model and \nSEVIRI data were equated (Figure 4). This is an appropriate method, since cdf matching \nreduces systematic biases between model and observations without attributing the biases to a \nsource [Drusch et al., 2005]. Here, the scaled SEVIRI LST denoted by x\u2032 was given by the \nsolution to equation 11: \n \ncdfm(x\u2032) = cdfs(x)         (11) \n \nwhere cdfm and cdfs denote the cdf\u201fs of the model LST and SEVIRI LST respectively; with x \nbeing the unscaled SEVIRI LST. \n \n3.2. Data Assimilation \n \nFollowing the bias correction, SEVIRI LST was assimilated into the model B \nparameterization of JULES for the entire year of 2007. An important step to undertake prior \nto assimilation analysis is to identify an optimum number of ensemble members. Figure 5 \nidentifies a considerable reduction in RMSE, with respect to MODIS LST, when even a small \nensemble size is used in comparison to the modeled scenario. This reduction continues as the \nnumber of ensemble members is increased, but at a decreasing rate. Since increased ensemble \nsize corresponds to an increased computational burden, the desired number of ensemble \nmembers should maximize the RMSE reduction while minimizing the computational load. \nFor the assimilation experiment an ensemble size of 100 was chosen, as any further \nreductions in RMSEs for larger ensemble sizes were minimal. \nThe time series of LST for 2007 (Figure 6) illustrates the change in JULES LST in the \ncontext of the MODIS LST. What we found was that the model predictions under the \ninfluence of data assimilation were more comparable with this alternative LST dataset than \nwere the modeled values; with a 54.5% reduction in RMSE from 2.11 K to 0.96 K. Larger \nadjustments were experienced during the middle of the year, due to larger changes during the \nhottest hours of each day for this period of the year; whereas the start and end of the year \nexperienced reductions in LST as a result of greater changes during the night but in a \ndownward direction.  \nFurthermore, a comparison was made between the soil moisture outputs of the model \nwith and without LST data assimilation, and SSM scatterometer values in the top 5cm of the \nsoil over an area of West Africa for the first five months of 2007 (Figure 7). The modeled \nvalues are clearly higher than the SSM \u201eobservations\u201f derived from the ERS scatterometer. \nFollowing assimilation, the updated model estimates are closer to the \u201eobservation\u201f values. \nThis can be quantified as a 21.6% reduction in RMSE, from 17.1vol% to 13.4vol% between \nthe model estimates and the ERS scatterometer \u201eobservations\u201f. A t-statistic of 10.4, generated \nfrom t-tests assuming equal variances on the mean RMSEs from 50 repeated open loop and \nmodel runs with LST data assimilation, indicated that these reductions in RMSE were \nsignificant at the 99% confidence level. The spatial distribution of the differences between \nthese updated model estimates following LST assimilation and the model estimates without \ndata assimilation are illustrated in figure 8. Corresponding time series for evapotranspiration \n(ET) and LE over the same geographical area for this five month period are illustrated in \nfigure 9; whereby the changes in LE are driven by changes in ET. \nDuring 2007, the values of H and LE fluxes for open loop and model runs with LST data \nassimilation were compared against in situ measurements from Skukuza, Mongu, \nTchizalamou, and Demokeya from October to December (Table 3). This was the only period \nof sufficient collection from all of these sites during this year. Reductions in RMSE were \nrecorded for both H and LE fluxes from the assimilation runs, compared with the respective \nfluxes from the standard model runs, with respect to the fluxes recorded at all four Eddy \nCovariance towers. The reduction in RMSE of H with respect to the flux recorded at \nDemokeya shows the strongest reduction of uncertainty through the LST data assimilation. \nWhen these reductions were tested on 50 repeated open loop and model runs with LST data \nassimilation using t-tests assuming equal variances, all the reductions were significant at the \n95% confidence level, with six of these being significant at the 99% confidence level. \n \n4. Discussion \n \nLST validation with ground measurements can be both time consuming, and limited in its \ngeographical extent. An intercomparison exercise between thermal products generated aboard \nEO satellites provides a more realistic alternative over large spatial and temporal scales; with \nthese products also representing the most feasible source of observation values for \nassimilating into regional and global parameterizations of land surface models, such as the \nUK Met Office\u201fs JULES model. A caveat to the intercomparsion test carried out here is that \ndue to cloud contamination, available MODIS LST products were limited. Indeed, cloud \nmasking makes any intercomparison a more challenging undertaking, as fewer pixels are \navailable for analysis. However, an improvement could be achieved with the use of the latest \nMODIS LST version (V5), which includes a refinement in the cloud screening process [Wan, \n2008]. Even so, the loss of pixels to cloud contamination is limiting, particularly for the \ncomparison with AATSR retrievals due to the longer repeat cycle. \nJULES is an evolving land surface model, whereby recent studies [Alton et al., 2007b; \nMercado et al., 2007] have made improvements to the standard implementation. \nFurthermore, recent sensitivity and validation analyses of JULES [Alton et al., 2007a; de \nRosnay et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2009] have established confidence in the biophysical \nrepresentations of ecosystem processes in tropical biomes, including those covering Africa. \nData assimilation represents the next logical step in further improving the reliability of the \nmodel and reducing uncertainties inherent in all such land surface models. \n A variable with potentially far reaching influence in land surface models is LST. In \nJULES this variable is derived from the surface energy balance. When this was compared \nwith the satellite-derived LST data, we found the model underestimated LST when compared \nwith all three satellite-derived LST datasets during the entire diurnal cycle, with larger biases \nexperienced for less vegetated surface types (Table 1). We suggest several possible \nexplanations for this discrepancy. First, there is a tendency for satellite-derived LST data to \nsystematically over-estimate in situ measurements. This occurrence was reported by Trigo et \nal. [2008a] for SEVIRI observations, with possible explanations of sensor calibration and a \nfavoring of sunlit surfaces being proposed. Second, the assumptions present in the algorithms \nfor generating high level thermal products may be inconsistent with those in the land surface \nmodel, resulting maybe in an inadequate processing of long wave emissivity in JULES, \nwhich has not been investigated here and will require further examination. Finally, the \nparameterization of thermal and hydrological soil characteristics do not appropriately \nrepresent the spatial heterogeneity of these qualities for sparsely vegetated regions. This is \npertinent since the bare soil surface temperature in JULES is quantified from the temperature \nof the upper layer in the soil profile as well as the surface energy balance equation. This final \npossibility provided motivation for the study by Houldcroft et al. [2009] to improve the \ndescription of surface albedo in land surface models. \n When this modified soil albedo data set, derived from the MODIS MCD43C1 albedo \nproduct, was employed in the model, and the standard soil parameters from the global \nvegetation and soils data set of Wilson and Henderson-Sellers [1985] were substituted for \nparameters derived from the ISLSCP II soil data set, a reduction in the biases between model \nand EO products was recorded. It is reasonable to accept this improvement with the \nrecognition that soil moisture, and surface albedo, are two of the most significant determining \nfactors in LST variability [Goward et al., 2002]. Soil moisture has a significant influence on \nthe partitioning of energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes. For instance, a wet soil surface \nis cooler and loses more latent heat, whereas a dry soil surface generally corresponds to \nhigher surface temperatures and loses more sensible heat [Smith et al., 2006]. Surface albedo, \ndetermines the amount of energy absorbed by the land surface. The modified albedo data set \ndeveloped for land surface modeling is more comparable with EO albedo products, \nparticularly over sparsely vegetated regions [Houldcroft et al., 2009]. \nProbably all land surface models, including JULES, are limited by the accuracy to which \ntheir representation of physical processes imitate the terrestrial biosphere. Optimization of \nvariable estimation, such as LST, can be achieved by assimilating observation data into the \nmodel through a mechanism like the EnKF. This technique balances the uncertainty in both \nthe model and observations, but is subject to sampling errors which are a function of the \nensemble size [Evensen, 2003]. It is therefore important to select an appropriately sized \nensemble that on the one hand minimizes the sampling errors and obtains satisfactory results, \nwhereas concurrently reducing the computational burden. \nMoreover, EnKF data assimilation over land is often based on covariance localization \nmethods, in which sampled cross-covariances between geographically disparate points are \nexplicitly set to zero. The concept here is to sub-divide the global analysis into smaller sub-\ndomains which are independently analyzed based only on local observations, with these sub-\ndomains simultaneously updated in parallel as implemented in Hamill et al. [2001] and \nHoutekamer and Mitchell [2001]. This requirement is because of the uncertainties in \nsampling cross-covariances using finite ensembles sizes, and the possibility of creating \nspurious cross-correlations. Indeed, Reichle and Koster [2003] have found covariance \nlocalization to increase the accuracy of estimations for small ensemble sizes in particular. In \nthis study analysis is sub-divided into the individual model grid cells which are independent \nof each other since no lateral fluxes exist in JULES.  \nThe reduction in RMSE with respect to MODIS LST is clearly discernable as the \nensemble size is initially increased, with further improvement experienced at a decreasing \nrate for larger ensemble sizes (Figure 5). Indeed when t-tests assuming equal variances were \nperformed on the mean RMSEs from 50 repeated runs, the reduction in RMSE remained \nstatistically significant at the 5% level even when the ensemble size was increased from 50 to \n100, but this ceased to be the case when the ensemble size was further increased to 150. The \nchosen size of 100 therefore produced acceptable results - whereby a further increase in size \nto 150 did not significantly improve the EnKF results. \nMuch of the shift in the LST as a result of assimilation occurred during the hottest parts \nof each day, particularly for regions with sparse vegetation coverage. One possibility for this \noccurrence could be that the model is simulating sub-optimal diffusion of heat between the \nland surface and the top soil layer, thereby producing large variances in the LST estimations. \nA caveat to these findings is that although the observation perturbations remain constrained \nby a fixed product uncertainty; the lower dependency on the differential heating or cooling of \nthe surface, a result of sunlit or shadow areas, during the daytime could result in observation \nerrors that are larger than the applied product uncertainty. Indeed, SEVIRI observations \nduring the daytime hours are reported to regularly fail to meet the accuracy target of the \nsatellite application facility on land surface analysis (LandSAF), who generate and \ndisseminate SEVIRI data, of 2.0 K over desert and semi-arid regions [Trigo et al., 2008b]. \nIt evident from figure 7 that a reduction in the model predictions of soil moisture over an \narea of West Africa for the period 1\nst\n January \u2013 31st May 2007 has resulted through the \nprocess of data assimilation. This corresponds to reductions in both ET and LE experienced \nfor this same spatial and temporal window (figure 9). The ET rate is controlled by stomatal \nconductance, which is affected by the quantity of photosynthetically active radiation. \nFurthermore, the positive relationship between ET and net primary productivity (NPP), as \nsuggested by Rosenzweig [1968], implies the assimilation of LST also has the potential to \ninfluence the inter-annual variability in the carbon cycle. \nAdditionally, the change in LST influences the H flux; whereby the increase in surface \nenergy is differentially partitioned into H and LE; as a result of the changes in the \ntemperature and humidity gradients respectively in the surface boundary layer. This is a \nconsequence of the proportional changes to LST experienced over the vegetated and non-\nvegetated fractions of each grid box. The result of these changes in the surface energy budget \nis that reductions in RMSEs for H and LE fluxes are observed when evaluated against in situ \nmeasurements (Table 3). Although the magnitude of the RMSE reductions when compared \nwith measurements taken during the final three months of 2007 from Skukuza, Mongu and \nTchizalamou are relatively small, a possible reason may be because of the higher vegetative \ncover during the southern African wet season; whereas a larger RMSE reduction was \nexperienced for sensible heat flux when compared for the Demokeya site. This site is located \nin more sparsely vegetated ground, and is subject to the lowest annual precipitation (320mm) \nof the four sites; in comparison to Tchizalamou (1150mm), Mongu (945mm) and Skukuza \n(547mm). Moreover, the final three months of 2007 correspond to the beginning of the dry \nseason at Demokeya. Indeed, it is likely large RMSE reductions could also be experienced at \nalternative sites located within sparsely vegetated ground. Further investigation is thus \nrequired of the JULES model to see if LE and H are accurately simulated at other African \nground stations across a range of biomes. \nIt is feasible that changes to a key variable, such as LST, could have a detrimental \nimpact upon the energy fluxes within the model. Despite the fact that reductions in RMSEs \nfor H and LE fluxes were relatively small, with respect to the Eddy Covariance \nmeasurements, the changes to these fluxes did not result in any increase in RMSE. Overall, \nwhen considering these findings, it can be argued that a benefit could be gained in updating \nthe modeled state with remotely sensed observations using an EnKF. This would be \nconsistent with findings from previous studies, such as Huang et al. [2008] and Pipunic et al. \n[2008].  \nAlthough promising in nature, these findings are based upon updating model LST by \nassimilating frequent observations from the SEVIRI sensor onboard the geostationary MSG \nsatellites. The temporal memory of JULES LST is limited to the previous 30 or 60 minute \ntime step. This may not be significant when the observations are the frequent SEVIRI \nretrievals, but can become pertinent for less frequent remote sensing observations from polar \norbiting satellites. Future research - utilizing an alternative observation operator - could \ntherefore examine updating variables in JULES with longer memory, such as soil \ntemperature, through the assimilation of remotely sensed LST products with less frequent \nretrievals, such as MODIS or AATSR. \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nThis paper has considered the importance of LST as an integral component in the \ncalculation of surface to atmosphere heat fluxes, and has investigated a technique to constrain \nthe estimations within a state-of-the-art land surface model. An intercomparison was carried \nout between the model simulated LST and various thermal remote sensing products. This \nrepresented an attractive alternative to verification with in situ measurements, which are \nsparsely located and may not easily represent a heterogeneous grid box.  Satellite-derived \nLST estimates were then assimilated into the land surface model using an EnKF filter.  \nAlthough differences exist for sparsely vegetated regions, LST simulated by JULES is \ncomparable with remotely sensed LST products. In light of the sensitivity of the LST to \nchanges in soil albedo and soil thermal and hydrologic characteristics however, further \ninvestigation into the soil parameterization of JULES merits attention. The differences \nbetween the model and satellite observations of LST can additionally be reduced through data \nassimilation. Our results indicate that data assimilation can indeed prove to be a consistent \nand reliable method of constraining the simulations of complex biophysical land surface \nmodels. Despite the ensemble size being one of the most sensitive approximations in the \nEnKF formulation, we found that satisfactory improvements can be made with relatively few \nensemble members. \nThis study represents the first step in producing an operational data assimilation scheme \nfor the JULES model; and indeed further work is also required in optimizing soil parameters, \nparticularly where LSTs are considerably underestimated, with vegetation parameterization \nalso worthy of closer investigation. Following these promising results in the experiments of \nLST assimilation, further work can be carried out both in the assimilation of LST from less \ntemporally frequent sources, such as MODIS and AATSR; and remotely sensed vegetation \nindices, such as NDVI data, thereby constraining the estimation of a surface dryness index to \nestimate live FMC; an important variable in modeling fire occurrence and propagation. \nIndeed, data assimilation offers the opportunity of integrating numerous reflectance products \ninto land surface models with the prospect of reducing the considerable uncertainties in the \nsimulation of biogeochemical fluxes. \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis work has been funded by the NERC Climate and Land Surface Systems Interactions \nCentre (CLASSIC).
