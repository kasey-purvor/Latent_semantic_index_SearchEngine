Pollutants as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are of worldwide concern, due to their \ndetrimental effects on the physiology and behaviour of wildlife. One major source of EDCs is \nsewage treatment works which serve as foraging grounds for many bird species. However, the \nrisks of consuming EDCs to wild birds at these sites have been largely overlooked. \n2. We have previously quantified contamination levels of invertebrates from within filter beds \nof sewage treatment works and the intake rates of these invertebrates by wild European \nstarlings feeding at these sites. Our work to date has shown that environmentally-relevant \nEDC exposure results in reduced immunocompetence, increased song behaviour and neural \ndevelopment in adult starlings. \n3. In the present study, we hypothesized that nestling starlings exposed to similar EDC levels \nfrom contaminated prey, from parental feeding at sewage treatment works, would show \naltered growth and physiology. \n4. Our findings show that EDC exposure results in reduced growth and immunocompetence in \nnestling birds. However, there was no effect on corticosterone or haematocrit levels. As \ngrowth rates and immunocompetence are likely to be related to survival rates, we suggest that \nthese exposure levels are likely to adversely affect recruitment into the adult population.  \n5. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the potential transfer of EDCs between \nsemiaquatic or aquatic organisms and terrestrial organisms up the food chain at sites of \nsewage treatment works, broadening the scope of potential routes of exposure. Our findings \nsuggest that birds foraging in these sites are at risk of physiological manipulation from EDCs \nand reduced body condition as a result. We advocate further work to evaluate the potential for \nEDCs from sewage treatment works to bioaccumulate and modulate the condition of wild \norganisms feeding on contaminated prey. Our results suggest that changes in management \npractices of sewage treatment works are required. We support measures to reduce EDC levels \n 3 \nin sewage treatment works and that these sites should be designed to exclude or deter wildlife \nfrom foraging on contaminated prey. The management implications of such policy \u2013 oriented \nsteps will ensure the health of wildlife foraging at sewage treatment works. \n \nKey-words: endocrine disruption, estrogens, nestlings, parental care, pollution, sewage, \nstarlings, Sturnus vulgaris, xenoestrogens  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 \nIntroduction \nIn the last 20 years there has been significant concern over a group of natural and synthetic \npollutants which act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (Colborn, Saal & Soto 1993; \nKavlock et al. 1996; Jobling et al. 1998). These chemicals alter the normal function of the \nendocrine system (Tabb & Blumberg 2006), with knock-on effects for other physiological \nfunctions (e.g. immune system; Hamed 2000). Because of their specificity for hormone \nreceptors, some EDCs can elicit physiological changes in aquatic organisms at very low \nconcentrations of only a few nanograms\/L of water (Routledge et al. 1998). The main EDC \nsources are anthropogenic, such as discharges from agricultural, municipal and industrial \nwastewaters (Dosis & Kamarianos 2007). To date most studies on the physiological effects of \nEDC exposure have focused on aquatic organisms (e.g. Sumpter, Jobling & Tyler 1996; Mills \n& Chichester 2005). \nChemicals which manipulate the endocrine system by binding to hormone receptors for a \nrange of steroid hormones have been shown to alter reproductive anatomy (Jobling et al. \n1998; Clotfelter, Bell & Levering 2004), reduce reproduction rates (Iguchi & Katsu 2008), \nresult in somatic anatomical malformation (e.g. Sower, Reed & Babbitt 2000) and change the \nbody condition of aquatic organisms (Zhong et al. 2005). However, as exposure levels of wild \norganisms to EDCs are often hard to quantify, predicting the environmentally-relevant \ndetrimental effects is often difficult, if not impossible (Denslow & Sep\u00falveda 2007) and often \na causal link between exposure to EDCs and the physiological and behavioural effects of \nendocrine disruption in some wild organisms is difficult to demonstrate (Jobling & Tyler \n2006).  \nDetrimental effects of EDCs should be even more pronounced in young animals, which \nhave lower body mass, a faster cell division rate than adults, and are in the middle of their \ndevelopmental process (see Grote et al. 2009). In addition, such effects may have long lasting \n 5 \nconsequences as these developing animals may produce markers of developmental stress \n(Buchanan et al. 2003). To date, most evidence of any effects in young terrestrial animals \ncomes from laboratory studies, for example, exposure to the estrogen 17 alpha-\nethinylestradiol during development altered reproductive physiology and behaviour in adult \nfemale Sprague-Dawley rats (Della Seta et al. 2008). Experimental effects of ecologically - \nrelevant levels of EDCs on young wildlife remain largely untested. \nWe have recently shown that invertebrates such as earthworms Eisenia fetida living \nwithin the biofilm of the sewage filter beds bioaccumulate a range of EDCs (Markman et al. \n2007). In the sewage sites sampled, E. fetida was found to contain substantially higher levels \nof 17 \u03b2 estradiol (E2), dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate and bisphenol A compared to E. \nfetida sampled in organic compost sites (Markman et al. 2007). This is of concern because the \nrich invertebrate macrofauna of the sewage treatment works attract terrestrial species from \nhigher trophic levels such as birds (Fuller & Glue 1981; Frederick & McGehee 1994) and bats \n(Park & Cristinacce 2006; Kalcounis-Rueppell et al. 2007). These terrestrial vertebrate \npredators feed on the diverse range of invertebrates, which either spend part (e.g. dipterans) or \ntheir entire lifecycle (e.g. oligochaeta) within the sewage biofilm (Learner & Chawner 1998).  \nStarlings often feed at sewage works and use earthworms (E. fetida) as their prey items \n(Feare 1984). Using contamination levels calculated from field sampling (Markman et al. \n2007), we recently tested the impact of the suite of estrogenic chemicals identified in our \nearthworm samples on the physiology and behaviour of wild caught adult European starlings \nSturnus vulgaris Linnaeus. Our results demonstrated that adult male starlings, experimentally \ndosed with the full spectrum of chemicals identified in the earthworm samples, showed \nreduced immunocompetence, but enhanced song complexity due to hypermasculinisation of \nthe brain, compared to birds in the control group (Markman et al. 2008). As starlings also \nfeed their young with invertebrates from contaminated areas such as sewage works during the \n 6 \nbreeding season (Root 1990; S. Markman unpublished data), in the present study we sought to \ntest the effects of the same chemicals on nestling development. We hypothesized that \nnestlings fed the same suite of EDCs, at an age - adjusted environmentally - relevant dose \nlevels as calculated in our previous work on adults (Markman et al. 2008), would show \nreduced physiological condition and growth compared to control birds. Specifically, we \npredicted that reduced physiological condition would be represented by a reduction in \nhaematocrit levels, immunocompetence, growth, and increased corticosterone production in \nexperimental nestlings, compared to control nestlings. Corticosterone is the principle avian \nstress hormone and elevated body levels are indicative of a physiological challenge to \nhomeostasis. Therefore, we further predicted an increase in basal levels of corticosterone as \nan indicator of chronic stress, as our manipulations sought to expose birds to an EDC dose \ntwice daily as an environmental stressor during early development (see details below). \n \nMaterials and methods \nSTUDY SITE  \nThis study was carried out in 2006 in Cambridgeshire, England, U.K.[Give latitude & \nlongitude] Starling nest boxes were identified and monitored for reproductive activity from 12 \nApril 2006, before egg laying. Breeding starlings were documented foraging up to 2 km away \nfrom their nest, even when the availability of suitable foraging habitat was low [do you mean \nlow? You would expect them to forage further away if the area round the nest was low \nquality. Please check sentence and rephrase as appropriate.] around their nest area (Feare \n1984; Bruun & Smith 2003). Therefore, all nests included in the study, were at least 5 km \naway from active sewage treatment works, reducing the risk of parents feeding on \ncontaminated prey items during the experiment. We tested the effects of EDC exposure on \nnestling development using 10 broods of starling nestlings (N = 48 nestlings). Before and \n 7 \nduring the experimental dosing, all nestlings were weighed from hatching until 15 days of \nage, which is a few days before fledging at 21 days of age, to avoid premature fledgling. \nNestlings were individually marked on their claws by different colours of nail varnish. At 14 \ndays of age, all nestlings were individually colour ringed. \n \nCHEMICAL ANALYSIS AND DOSING \nDose rates were set following the calculation of chemical contamination levels of invertebrate \nprey from 20 sewage treatment works across south-west UK in 2003\/4 (Markman et al. 2007). \nIn this study, we found that the main prey item taken by adult starlings was the earthworm E. \nfetida and it is well established that earthworms are included as a prey item of nestling \nstarlings (Feare 1984; Wright et al. 1998). Individual adult starlings took in on average 14.4 g \nday \n-1\n wet weight of invertebrates from the sewage filter beds (Markman et al. 2008). As the \ndaily food intake of invertebrates for adult starlings is approximately 30 g day \n-1\n wet weight \n(Feare 1984) during the period when they are feeding nestlings, food intake from sewage \nfilter beds represents ca \u2013 50 % of their daily food intake (Markman et al. 2008). To be \nconservative in our dosing regime of starling nestlings in the present study, we assumed that \ntheir parents brought 50 % of prey items from sewage filter beds. Doses were adjusted \naccording to daily food intake by a nestling starling. The mean daily food intake of a single \nstarling nestling between 1-5 days old is ca 25 g wet weight day\n -1\n, between day 6-10 ca 50g \nwet weight day\n -1\nand between day 11-15 ca 45g wet weight day\n -1\n (Tinbergen 1981). By \nmultiplying half of each of these food intakes by the levels of identified EDCs per gram of \ninvertebrates based on data in Markman et al. (2008), we calculated the following daily dose \nlevels to be administered to the nestlings: 1 \u2013 5 days old, 125 ng of 17 \u03b2 estradiol (E2), 75 ng \ndibutyl phthalate, 325 ng dioctyl phthalate and 50 ng bisphenol A in 10 \u00b5L of sunflower oil. \nFrom day 6 - 10, 250 ng of 17 \u03b2 estradiol (E2), 150 dibutyl phthalate, 650 ng dioctyl phthalate \nand 100 ng bisphenol A, and from day 11 - 15, 225 ng of 17 \u03b2 estradiol (E2), 135 ng dibutyl \n 8 \nphthalate, 585 ng dioctyl phthalate and 90 ng bisphenol A in 10 \u00b5L of sunflower oil. From \ndays 1-5, doses were administered by a gavage needle and from days 6-15, doses were \nadministered via oil-injected mealworm Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus. We dosed the nestlings \ntwice daily (early morning and late afternoon to mimic daily nestling feeding peaks and to aid \nabsorption in the gut), by dividing the above doses into two. Control nestlings received 10 \u00b5L \nof sunflower oil only via gavage (days 1-5) or inside a mealworm (days 6-15), in similar ways \nto the treatment nestlings. We alternated the order of daily dosing each brood to balance for \nthe time of the day effect across the different nests. Parents resumed provisioning their \nnestlings usually within a few minutes of dosing. \n \nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \nWe determined initiation of egg laying, clutch size and hatching dates through daily visits to \nnest boxes. Once the nestlings had hatched, nestlings within a nest were paired, matched for \nbody size and each member of the pair was assigned to one of two treatment groups: control \nor treatment (EDC dosed). In the case of odd number of nestlings in a given brood, we \nalternated the treatment of the odd nestling between broods. Any potential minor variation in \nnestling size\/body mass within these pairings was balanced within broods by swapping the \ntreatment for the largest nestling in each case. This design of within-nest manipulation \nallowed control for differences in parental and territorial quality between the different pairs of \nparents.  \nWe measured the nestlings at hatching and then at 5, 10 and 15 days old. These \nmeasurements included: body mass, tarsus length, and wing length (at day 15 only). On day \n11, the cell-mediated immune response of the nestlings was tested by using an injection of \nphytohaemagglutinin (PHA) into both wings webs. PHA is a plant lectin, which promotes a \nhypersensitivity reaction and has been used extensively to test avian immune function \n(Lochmiller, Vestey & Boren 1993). The thickness of both wing webs was measured (taking \n 9 \nan average of 3 measurements) at the same location on the wing before injection and 24 hours \nafter injection, using callipers (Moore & Wright\u2122; to 0.1 mm). PHA (Sigma L-8754) in \nphosphate buffered saline (PBS; 0.150\u00b5g PHA in 50 \u00b5L PBS in each wing web) was injected \ninto both wings webs of each bird (following Lochmiller, Vestey & Boren 1993; Smits, \nBortolotti & Tella 1999; Granbom, Raberg & Smith 2005). Blood samples were obtained for \nbasal corticosterone levels (samples taken within 3 minutes of nest disturbance) and \nhaematocrit levels on day 15 post-hatch. Fifty microlitres of blood were taken by \nvenepuncture in capillary tubes and spun for 5 min at 13,000 r.p.m. in a centrifuge (Jouan \nA13, VA, USA). The resultant packed cell length was measured to the nearest mm and the \npercentage of blood cells in each sample was calculated.  \nFor the determination of corticosterone levels, blood samples (100 \u00b5L) were collected in \nheparinized capillary tubes after puncture of the brachial vein with a 25 gauge needle, \ncentrifuged and the plasma stored at -20 \u00baC for later hormone assay. Corticosterone \nconcentrations were measured after extraction of 20 \u00b5l aliquots of plasma in diethyl ether, by \nradioimmunoassay (Wingfield 1994) using anti-corticosterone antiserum (code B21-42, \nEndocrine Sciences, Tarzana, CA) and [1,2,6,7-3H] - corticosterone label (Amersham, UK). \nThe extraction efficiency was 75-90%. Samples were run in one assay with 50% binding at \n123 pg per tube, and the detection limit (for 7.3 \u03bcL aliquots of extracted plasma) at 0.45 ng \nmL\n -1\n.  \n \nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS \nAll data were reduced to single parameter estimates for each nestling prior to analyses. Five \nnestlings died before day 15 (1 experimental, 4 control), so the statistical analysis was \nconducted on the basis of the 43 surviving nestlings in the following brood sizes: (i) two \nchicks (n= number of broods, n=1), (ii) three chicks (n=2), (iii) four chicks (n=2), (iv) five \nchicks (n=3) and (v) six chicks (n=2).  \n 10 \nWe used repeated measures ANOVA, with nestling age (i.e. 0 = hatching date, 5, 10 and 15 \ndays old) and treatment within nest (i.e. control nestlings versus EDC dosed nestlings) as \nwithin-subjects effects. To analyze the type of data that we had, while using these two within-\nsubjects effects in a repeated-measures ANOVA, we had to use the average value of each \ndependent variable across all the chicks of one treatment in a given brood as one datum point. \nThis meant that we had two average values of each dependent variable for each brood for a \ngiven age, one for the control nestlings and the second for the EDC dosed nestlings. In that \nway, we could perform repeated measures ANOVA using both nestling age and treatment \nwithin a nest as within-subjects effects including the interaction term between these two \nrepeated measures. We then explored the linearity of nestling age effect by using polynomial \ncontrasts. We used brood size as a between-subject effect in the above mentioned repeated \nmeasures ANOVA. Where dependent variables were recorded only once, we used repeated \nmeasures ANOVA only with treatment within nest as the repeated measure and brood size as \nbetween-subjects effects. However, as brood size effects were not significant across the \nanalysis of all the dependent variables (all P values > 0.05), we excluded brood size as a \npossible effect from all the repeated measures ANOVA models that are reported later. We used \nSPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for all our statistical analyses. \n \nResults \nAt hatching there was no significant difference between the treatment groups in nestling body \nmass (repeated measures ANOVA, F1, 8 = 0.184, P= 0.679), or tarsus length (repeated measures \nANOVA, F , = 0.0 , P= 0. ).  \nNestlings allocated to the experimental treatment group grew slower in terms of body \nmass during the experimental period, compared to control nestlings (repeated-measures \nANOVA, F1, 8 = 23.84, P = 0.001; Fig. 1). There was also a significant non-linear increasing \n 11 \neffect of age on body mass along the experimental manipulation (repeated-measures ANOVA, \nF3, 24 = 2430.68, P<0.001; cubic contrasts within repeated-measures model: F1, 8 = 110.35, \nP<0.001), and a significant interaction between treatment and age (repeated-measures ANOVA, \nF3, 24=6.60, P=0.002). This is in part because while at hatching there was a non-significant \ndifference in body mass between the two treatment groups, the mass of the nestlings in these \ngroups deviated when they grew older (Fig. 1). There was a significant effect of treatment on \nbody mass at the end of the manipulation (15 days of age): nestlings fed with EDCs were \nlighter than their control nest mates (repeated-measures ANOVA, F1, 8 = 35.56, P < 0.001).  \nThere was a significant non-linear increasing effect of age on tarsus growth (repeated-\nmeasures ANOVA, F3, 24=273.49, P<0.001; quadratic contrasts within repeated-measures \nmodel: F1, 8 = 88.69, P<0.001), no effect of treatment (repeated-measures ANOVA, F1, 8 = 2.63, \nP = 0.143) and a non-significant interaction between age and treatment (repeated measures \nANOVA, F3, 24 = 0. 73, P=0.457). Treatment did not affect wing length at the end of the \nexperiment (repeated measures ANOVA, F1, 8 = 0.21, P = 0.655).  \nNestlings in the treatment group suffered reduced immunocompetence, showing a lower \nresponse to PHA injection as compared to control nestlings (repeated measures ANOVA, F1, 8 = \n18.14, P = 0.003; Fig. 2). There was no effect of treatment (repeated measures ANOVA, F1, 8 = \n1.37, P = 0.274) on haematocrit levels. There was no effect of treatment (Repeated measures \nANOVA, F1, 8 = 0.001, P = 0.982) on basal corticosterone titre.  \n \n \nDiscussion  \nAnthropogenic change such as pollution has profound effects on avian populations (Fry 1995; \nBowerman et al. 2000). One of the most difficult effects to define is the importance of \nexposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Within aquatic environments EDCs are \n 12 \nthought to pose one of the most significant threats to the health and welfare of wildlife (Feyk \n& Giesy 1998; Jenssen 2006) through immersion in polluted water (Gross - Sorokin et al. \n2003). In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that EDCs appear to bioaccumulate in \ninvertebrates living and developing in filter beds of sewage treatment plants (Markman et al. \n2007; Park et al. 2009). We further demonstrated that adult starlings are affected by \necologically-relevant experimental doses of EDCs (Markman et al. 2008). To the best of our \nknowledge, the present study is the first to experimentally demonstrate that developing wild \nterrestrial birds are potentially at risk from the effects of environmental levels of EDCs \noriginated from sewage.  \nWe have demonstrated that artificial dosing with the suite of EDCs identified as occuring \nin the starling\u2019s prey (Markman et al. 2007) resulted in reduced growth and reduced \nimmunocompetence in nestling starlings. Reduced body mass at fledging and reduced \nimmune function are known to be negatively associated with survival rate of young birds \n(Horak et al. 1999; Christe et al. 2001; Menu, Gauthier & Reed 2005). However, Mayne et al. \n(2004) determined the relative effects of pesticides in current use and of persistent residues of \np,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), a known endocrine disrupting chemical, \non tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, and found no significant differences in body mass of \nnestlings sampled from sprayed orchards and reference sites. As opposed to body mass \ndifferences between EDC-dosed nestlings and control nestlings, treatment with EDC had no \neffect on tarsus growth or wing length. It appeared that the structural growth of the nestlings \nwas not affected; but that control nestlings were in better condition (namely higher body mass \nbut similar body size) compared to the EDC - dosed nestlings.  \nOur results are consistent with previous findings that adult male starlings, dosed \nexperimentally with the same suite of EDCs, suffered reduced cellular and humoral immune \nfunction (Markman et al. 2008). However, our previous work did not find any detrimental \n 13 \neffect of chemical dosing on body mass, although these birds had attained their adult mass \nbefore the start of the study. It seems likely therefore that mass gain during development is \nmore susceptible to the effects of endocrine disrupters than the maintenance of adult mass.  \nThere is evidence that EDCs result in immunosuppression via various general \nmechanisms such as changes in antibody production, nitric oxide synthesis, cytokine \nsynthesis, and changes to the allergic response (Chalubinski & Kowalski 2006) as well as \ncellular effects such as reduction in T cell function. In part, this is reflected by a reduced \nresponse to PHA immune challenge (Ahmed 2000), which has been found in the present \nstudy. Some EDCs, such as the herbicide triazine, have been shown to alter growth in young \nanimals such as in Japanese quail Coturnix japonica chicks; however exposure levels of these \nanimals were above ecologically relevant levels (Wilhelms et al. 2006). [see paper by Poulin \net al., above] The potential multiple mechanisms that result in these slower growth rates are \nnot fully understood.  \nOur study detected no significant treatment effect on either hematocrit or basal \ncorticosterone levels, in agreement with our previous study on adult starlings. This may be \nbecause these physiological indices were not affected within our sampling time points, or \nbecause no such effects exist. Even though basal levels of corticosterone may appear \nunaffected by our EDC treatment, a stress-induced response may possibly have shown a \ndifference in corticosterone levels. However, our main aim was to test whether EDCs cause a \nlong term chronic effect on condition, not whether they potentially can affect acute \ncorticosterone production. Previous studies have indicated that increased basal corticosterone \nlevels, peak corticosterone response and\/or response to ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic \nhormone) challenge and greater thymic lymphocyte density, cortical\/medullary ratios and \nsignificant splenic B-cell hyperplasia may result from exposure to pesticides, such as p,p'-\n 14 \nDDE, with known endocrine disruptive effects, in tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor and \nEastern bluebirds Sialia sialis (Martinovic et al. 2003; Mayne et al. 2004).  \nAs EDCs may directly or indirectly affect different physiological systems other than the \nendocrine system, such as the reproductive system, immune system, cardiovascular and \nnervous system (Vos et al. 2000; Guillette 2006; Chiu et al. 2010), our results suggest that \nwhen testing the effects of EDCs on wildlife, multiple end-points should be recorded to fully \nassess the potential effects of these chemicals. Our results do not confirm that these chemicals \nhave caused endocrine disruption within our experimentally treated birds, as the mechanisms \nunderlying the observed effects were not quantified. However, as these chemicals are all \nknown to alter endocrine function, the most parsimonious explanation is that endocrine \nmodulation is involved in the physiological changes observed as a result of EDC \nconsumption. Future work can now focus on the mechanisms underlying the functional \nresponse of the endocrine system as well as other body systems to the EDC exposure.  \nWhilst we suggest that these chemicals can have considerable effects on nestling bird \ndevelopment, our results should be interpreted with caution. Population level effects will \ndepend on the broad applicability of the EDC contamination levels and intake rates. Starlings \nmay feed on other EDC contaminated food items outside sewage treatment works such as at \nagricultural areas. Further work is needed to test the variation in EDC contaminated prey \ntypes taken from non-sewage sites. If the levels of EDCs found in this study are broadly \nrepresentative of the situation in the wild then our results may have implications at the \npopulation level. In addition, earlier work has shown that female starlings preferred the song, \nof males fed EDC contaminated prey (Markman et al. 2008). As these males were in poorer \ncondition compared to control males, it seems likely that this will negatively affect their \nparental care levels, breeding success and survival. As both nestling and adult birds suffer \nfrom harmful effects while feeding at sewage treatment works, the birds\u2019 direct physiological \n 15 \ndamage may be exacerbated by skewed mate choice preferences toward the less healthy \nindividuals within a population.  \nThe starling has shown considerable population declines in recent years in many parts of \nthe world, including the U.K (over 50% decrease in the last forty years) (Robinson, \nSiriwardena & Crick 2005). The reasons underlying this change are complex and undoubtedly \ninclude factors such as habitat fragmentation, change in farm management practices, changes \nin food resources, pesticide use and loss of nest sites (see review Cheek 2006). However, \nexposure to EDCs and their effects as found in the present study may also play an important \nrole in starling population decrease.  \nMost of the correlative evidence for the effects of EDCs {e.g. p, p\u2032-DDE and \npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)} in wild birds comes from fish-eating bird species (e.g. \nbald eagles Haliaeetus leucocephalus) that feed on contaminated fish and suffer from thyroid \ndisorders, reproductive and teratogenic effects (Bowerman et al. 2000). Varying levels of \nEDCs {e.g. PCBs, DDT and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)} found in plasma and \neggs of glaucous gulls Larus hyperboreus)from the Norwegian Arctic, were correlated with \nalterations in circulating reproductive hormones (Verreault et al. 2006) and smaller eggs and \nof varying composition (Verboven et al. 2009a). Furthermore, behavioural changes such as \nreduced nest site attendance in male glaucous gulls with increasing EDC levels in their \nplasma, suggest suboptimal thermal conditions for embryo development and possibly \nincreased egg predation risk (Verboven et al. 2009b). \nIn addition, historical studies in the USA and Europe have shown that some raptor species \nsuffered from eggshell thinning following exposure to pesticides which act as endocrine \ndisrupters such as p, p'-DDE (for reviews, see Botham et al. 1999; Dawson 2000; Giesy et al. \n2003). However, following a ban on the parent compound DDT in the USA and Europe, \neggshell thinning declined (Dawson 2000) although other pollutants may still cause this \n 16 \nphenomenon (Cheek 2006; Bouwman et al. 2008). Few studies have experimentally tested the \neffects of ecologically relevant levels of EDCs on young wild terrestrial vertebrate (e.g. \nRochester et al. 2009).  \nMany EDCs are assumed to be unstable and are not throught to bioaccumulate in the \nenvironment (Munkittrick 2001). In addition, there are relatively few routes for these \nchemicals to move from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment (Dawson 2000). We suggest \nthat more research is needed to quantify contamination levels for prey associated with sewage \nprocessing and the potential for food chain effects. Starlings are among many species that \nforage behaviour in this environment (Fuller & Glue 1978; Fuller & Glue 1980), particularly \nin the winter months when alternative food supplies may be lacking. Our results therefore \nhighlight the potential negative effects associated with allowing wildlife access to \nbioconcentrated levels of EDCs through the sewage treatment system.  \nGiven the world-wide loss of wetlands and the extended use of sewage treatment facilities \nfor water reuse and increased sanitation needs as the world population increases, the \nimportance of sewage treatment works as foraging sites of wildlife is predicted to increase \n(Murray & Hamilton, 2010). Given our results, we advocate an approach that seeks to exclude \nor deter wildlife from foraging at sewage treatment works with high levels of contamination \nby EDCs. This could be achieved through design changes to new beds to deter birds from \nwalking on the substrate. However, in recent years filter beds have become less common in \nEurope and activated sludge processing plants combined with settlement ponds are now \nfavoured. Some approaches may be cost effective and easily applied, such as the netting of \nsettlement lagoons to prevent access of aquatic birds, as for artificial fish ponds (Nemtzov & \nOlsvig-Whittaker 2003). However, minimising the exposure of aerial predators (birds and \nbats) feeding on emerging aerial insects will be more problematic and may involve the use of \ndeterrents (acoustic or visual), in combination with efforts to reduce contamination levels at \n 17 \nspecific sites. Waste water companies should monitor water levels of EDCs and other \npollutants as well as levels of bioaccumulation of these pollutants within invertebrates, in \norder to responsibly protect local wildlife communities. These measures are likely to be \ninstrumental in minimising the health risks to organisms such as wild birds and bats (Park et \nal. 2009). \nEd. \u2013 how does monitoring help to reduce the risk? It needs to be alongside with exclusion \nor deterrence measures. \n \nAcknowledgments \nWe thank Tony Turk for his technical help during this study and Jon Wright for fruitful \ndiscussions.
