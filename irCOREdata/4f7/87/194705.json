The additional cooling due to adia-\nbatic expansion can bring about condensation leading to the\nformation of nanoscale droplets. Condensation is a statistical\nprocess and therefore a variety of droplet sizes will result, a\nlog-normal distribution being the expected outcome.1 The\nmean size of the droplet, consisting of \u0005N\u0006 helium atoms, can\nbe altered by varying the reservoir gas pressure and tempera-\nture. As one would predict, an increase in temperature and\/or\na decrease in gas pressure is found to produce a decrease in\nthe average size of the helium droplets.\nThe first report of a pulsed helium droplet source ap-\npeared in 2002. In this seminal work Slipchenko et al. suc-\nceeded in producing repetitive pulses of helium droplets by\nmodifying a commercially available pulsed valve such that it\ncould operate at cryogenic temperatures.2 A comparison of\nthe performance of the pulsed source with conventional con-\ntinuous supersonic expansion sources revealed a much\nhigher helium droplet flux with the former. In addition, a\npulsed source allows the use of smaller vacuum pumps, re-\nduces the consumption of expensive high-purity helium, and\nis better suited to experiments in which the droplets are\nprobed by pulsed lasers.\nUnfortunately, in their initial study Vilesov and co-\nworkers found it difficult to control the droplet size in any\nsystematic and predictable fashion. Variation of the helium\nreservoir pressure and temperature yielded a very different\nresponse when compared with continuous droplet sources.\nSpecifically, the average droplet size that could be produced\nwas found to vary over a relatively narrow range \u00012\u20137\n\u0001104 helium atoms\u0002 and with a dependence on temperature\nand pressure which bore no relationship to the conventional\nfree jet scaling laws.3,4 Although \u0005N\u0006 generally declined as\nthe temperature was increased at fixed gas pressure, this was\nnot universal, and unusual profiles were obtained at some\nreservoir gas pressures which in some cases showed maxima\nand minima. This erratic response to source conditions limits\nthe utility of the pulsed helium droplet source since it makes\nit difficult to predict the likely size of helium droplets for a\ngiven set of source conditions. Furthermore, access to a\ngreater range of droplet sizes would be highly beneficial in\nsome experiments. For example, for laser depletion spectra\nof molecules embedded inside helium droplets the preferred\ndroplet size consists of no more than a few thousand helium\natoms.\nIn this article we will show that a simple modification of\nthe nozzle geometry allows much greater control over he-\nlium droplet sizes. With this alteration, droplet sizes can be\nvaried over a much wider range and can be controlled in a\npredictable way by adjusting the source temperature and\/or\npressure. This step forward puts pulsed helium droplet\nsources on a par with continuous sources and may open up a\nwide variety of applications.\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe overall design of our helium nanodroplet instrument\nhas been presented elsewhere5,6 and so the discussion here\nconcentrates on the nozzle and the conditions under which it\noperates. We have found that the nozzle geometry is critical\nto achieve droplet size control in a smooth and reproducible\nfashion by variation of the source gas temperature and pres-\nsure. The pulsed source consists of a commercial solenoid\npulsed valve \u0001General Valve, series 99 model\u0002 attached to a\nhomemade stainless-steel faceplate. The valve is cooled by\ncontact with a closed-cycle cryostat which is capable of\nachieving temperatures as low as 4 K. The operating mecha-\nnism of the valve uses a retractable poppet to open and close\nthe aperture. Following Slipchenko et al.,2 we employ a pop-\npet made from Kel-F, a material which is able to withstand\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nandrew.ellis@le.ac.uk\nREVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS 76, 104102 \u00012005\u0002\n0034-6748\/2005\/76\u000210\u0001\/104102\/4\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics76, 104102-1\n This article is copyrighted as indicated in the article.

A leak-\ntight seal between the walls of the valve body and the face-\nplate is achieved using an indium gasket.\nWe have experimented with a variety of nozzle shapes\nmachined into the faceplate. With a straight channel of 0.5\nmm diameter drilled through the faceplate the result was\nlittle ability to control the droplet size and a restriction to\nlarge droplets \u0001average sizes \u00025\u0001104 helium atoms\u0002. We\nnext turned to the conical nozzle design reported by\nSlipchenko et al.,2 where the converging and diverging cones\nmeet at a simple knife-edge junction. In agreement with\nSlipchenko and co-workers, we again found that the ability\nto vary the droplet size in a systematic way was limited.\nHowever, a small alteration to the conical nozzle design was\nfound to make a dramatic difference. This alteration adds a\nshort constriction carefully machined between the two cones,\nas shown in Fig. 1. This constriction, or throat, was found to\nbe critical for allowing the controlled and predictable growth\nof helium droplets as a function of helium gas pressure and\nnozzle temperature. This simple improvement was found em-\npirically, but the explanation is probably that the short throat\nallows the onset of helium condensation prior to the rapid\ncooling that takes place in the exit cone. This intermediate\nzone confines the gas for short period of time, increasing the\nrate of collisions and providing the initial small nucleation\ncenters upon which controlled growth can then subsequently\ntake place in the diverging region of the nozzle. In addition\nto improved size control, the short throat was also found to\nsubstantially increase the droplet flux relative to a conical\nnozzle with a knife-edge throat.\nThe performance of the droplet source was monitored\nusing mass spectrometry. Ions were produced using a 70 eV\npulsed electron-beam source located approximately 1 m\ndownstream of the nozzle. The firing of the electron beam\nwas controlled by using a pulse delay generator and timed to\ncoincide with the arrival of the gas pulse at the mass spec-\ntrometer source region. The resulting ions were then repelled\nby an electric field into a reflectron time-of-flight mass spec-\ntrometer for mass analysis.\nRESULTS\nFigure 2 illustrates the temporal profile of the droplet\npulse for a nominal valve opening time of 140 \u0003s. This pro-\nfile was determined by detecting He2\n+ ions ejected from the\ndroplets by electron-impact ionization. These ions come ex-\nclusively from helium droplets and are therefore characteris-\ntic signatures of droplet formation. From the delay between\nthe firing of the valve and the firing of the pulsed electron\nbeam, we estimate that the flow velocity of the droplets is in\nthe region of 400 m s\u22121, which is comparable to the beam\nspeeds seen in continuous helium droplet sources.1 Short\nvalve opening times \u0001\u0004200 \u0003s\u0002 were found to give the stron-\ngest He2\n+ signals, in agreement with the earlier findings of\nSlipchenko et al.2 The full width at half maximum of the\nobserved He2\n+ profile is much narrower than the nominal\nopening time of the valve set by the control electronics but\nthis merely reflects the mechanical response of the valve op-\nerating mechanism.\nTwo types of experiments have been performed to ex-\nplore the effect of source conditions on the droplet sizes, the\nfindings of which are described below.\nDroplet size survey using residual water vapor\nThe simplest way to deduce the size of helium droplets\nis to exploit their ability to pick up foreign atoms or mol-\necules. The probability \u0001pk\u0002 that a helium droplet will acquire\nk molecules is given by the familiar Poisson distribution\npk\u0001z\u0002 = zk exp\u0001\u2212 z\u0002\/k ! , \u00011\u0002\nwhere z=\u0005nl ,\u0005 is the cross section of the helium droplet, n\nis the number density of the added gas, and l is the distance\nover which the droplet beam travels in contact with this gas.1\nRather than add a particular gas, we surveyed the range\nof droplet sizes by exploiting traces of water vapor in our\nspectrometer. Normally a nuisance, the low levels of water\nvapor in our instrument persist for many weeks after the\nvacuum is broken and are difficult to remove without thor-\nough baking of the vacuum apparatus.

A series of peaks due to\nthe formation of hydrated hydronium clusters, H3O+\u0001H2O\u0002m,\nwhere m\u00060, are highlighted by asterisks. In the lower panel\nwe have employed a nozzle temperature and helium gas stag-\nnation pressure that yields relatively large helium droplets,\nand this is reflected in the observation of hydrated hydro-\nnium clusters extending out to fairly large sizes. In contrast\nthe lower pressure and higher temperature used to generate\nthe mass spectrum in the upper panel in Fig. 3 shows that\nmuch smaller clusters predominate.\nClearly the differences in these two spectra contain in-\nformation about the helium droplet sizes. To quantify the size\ninformation several approximations are commonly em-\nployed, two of which we specifically flag here. First, we\nignore the contribution from any variation in helium droplet\nsizes and assume that all droplets have the average size \u0005N\u0006.\nThis is a widely used approximation and has been shown to\nyield an acceptable estimate of average helium droplet sizes.1\nSecondly, we have assumed that the relative intensities of\nH3O+\u0001H2O\u0002m peaks reflect the relative abundance of the neu-\ntral cluster \u0001H2O\u0002m+2 in the helium droplets. In other words,\nwe assume that electron-impact induces the process\n\u0001H2O\u0002+m+2\u2192H3O+\u0001H2O\u0002m+OH. Previous studies using\nelectron-impact ionization have shown that this is the domi-\nnant process in the gas phase,7,8 but nevertheless the excess\nenergy after ionization could induce some additional frag-\nmentation such that the observed ion distribution becomes\nartificially skewed towards smaller clusters. In fact such\nfragmentation is known to occur to some extent even when\nwater clusters are located in helium droplets, as shown in a\nspectroscopic and mass spectrometric study of water clusters\nby Fr\u00f6chtenicht et al.9 The consequence of neglecting this\nion fragmentation in calculating the helium droplet size is\nthat the answer obtained will tend to underestimate the true\naverage size. However, we expect this discrepancy to be rela-\ntively small and in any case we will persist with this approxi-\nmation because our main aim in this section is to show the\ndegree of variation in droplet sizes as a function of T and P,\nrather than determine reliable absolute sizes. Experiments\nwith residual water vapor allowed us to carry out this survey\nof the \bP ,T\t dependence relatively quickly without any con-\ncerns over the precise and reproducible control of the added\ngas partial pressure.\nThe observed relative abundances of H3O+\u0001H2O\u0002m in\neach mass spectrum were fitted to the Poisson distribution in\nEq. \u00011\u0002 for a wide range of temperatures and pressures.

However,\nthere are sufficient data to ascertain how \u0005N\u0006 scales with\nP and T.\nFigures 4 and 5 illustrate how z varies as P and T are\nvaried. A rapid growth in droplet size is found as the tem-\nperature is lowered for a fixed helium stagnation pressure.\nSimilarly, at fixed temperature the droplet grows systemati-\nFIG. 3.

This smooth and predict-\nable response to changes in source conditions contrasts\nsharply with the earlier work on pulsed droplet sources by\nSlipchenko et al.,2 but is very much in line with the response\nseen from continuous helium droplet sources.10\nAbsolute droplet sizes\nTo provide an estimate of the absolute helium droplet\nsizes, we added a specific gas into the pickup chamber at\nknown partial pressures and monitored the mass spectrum as\na function of the pressure. Toluene was chosen for this\npurpose and two example data sets, focusing on the toluene\nmonomer cation, are shown in Fig. 6. These plots were fitted\nto a Poisson distribution and yielded droplet sizes of\n10 880\u00b140 \u0001P=14 bars, T=13.0 K\u0002 and 29 100\u00b1200 \u0001P\n=10 bars, T=10.5 K\u0002 helium atoms. Having extracted these\nabsolute droplet sizes, the toluene data can be used to cali-\nbrate the droplet sizes for the water vapor experiments and\nthis in turn makes it possible to determine helium droplet\nsizes across the full range of explored source conditions.\nHowever, we emphasize that, as for water clusters, any con-\ntributions from toluene cluster ion fragmentation have not\nbeen accounted for in the data analysis. While we do not\nexpect this effect to be large, as demonstrated in comparable\nmeasurements using benzene in a continuous helium droplet\nbeam,11 we nevertheless caution that our droplet sizes are\nlikely to be lower limits to the true mean droplet size.\nDISCUSSION\nThe size of helium droplets emanating from continuous\nsources is commonly estimated using known scaling laws,\nwhich provide an explicit relationship between the average\ndroplet size, \u0005N\u0006, and the source conditions P and T. The use\nof scaling laws to estimate helium droplet sizes is clearly far\nmore convenient than making time-consuming measure-\nments of droplet sizes each time the nozzle source conditions\nare altered. There has been much discussion about scaling\nlaws in the literature and different formulas of the type \u0005N\u0006\n\u0007P\bT\t have been proposed.3,4,10 However perhaps the most\nwidely used expression among the helium nanodroplet user-\ncommunity shows \u0005N\u0006 scaling as approximately P2T\u22125.10\nA scaling law can be extracted from the data recorded in\nthis work yielding \b=0.956\u00b10.15 and \t=\u22126.04\u00b10.33. The\nstrong dependence of droplet size on the nozzle temperature\nis similar to that found for continuous sources, but the\npressure dependence is weaker for the pulsed source. Our\ncurrent measurements have been made over the ranges\nP=8\u201320 bars and T=10\u201316 K, and are therefore strictly\nvalid only within this region of \bP ,T\t space. However, even\nover this range we find that it is possible to vary the droplet\nsize smoothly over almost two orders of magnitude. Based\non the size calibration using toluene, the helium droplets at\nthe highest nozzle temperature and lowest stagnation pres-\nsure are estimated to consist of \u00072000 helium atoms. This is\nlikely to be a lower limit of the true cluster size for reasons\nrehearsed earlier, but it nevertheless suggests that the pulsed\nnozzle described in this work can produce droplets of a size\nsmall enough to suit, for example, laser depletion spectros-\ncopy experiments. At the other extreme, the highest pressure\n\u000120 bars\u0002 and lowest temperature \u000110 K\u0002 employed, we pro-\nduce droplets with a size \u0005N\u0006\u000680 000 helium atoms. Such\nlarge helium droplets may find utility in studying large mol-\necules and extended clusters within superfluid liquid helium.\nIn this work we have shown that smooth and predictable\ncontrol of helium droplet sizes is possible with a pulsed\nnozzle by variation of gas pressure and temperature in a\nmanner that is entirely comparable with existing continuous\nhelium droplet sizes. Pulsed helium droplet sources are\ntherefore now viable alternatives to continuous sources and\nmay soon see a wide range of applications.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the UK Engi-\nneering and Physical Sciences Research Council for a grant\nin support of this work.
