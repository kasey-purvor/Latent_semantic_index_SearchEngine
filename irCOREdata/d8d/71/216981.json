Due to the \u0087exible notion of a proposition, the\nmodel of judgment aggregation can represent many realistic decision problems.\nFor example, the propositions could be the following:\na : \"We can a\u00a4ord a budget de\u0085cit.\"\na! b: \"If we can a\u00a4ord a budget de\u0085cit, then we should increase spending\non education.\"\nb: \"We should increase spending on education.\"\nThe interest in judgment aggregation was sparked by the observation that\nmajority voting on logically connected propositions does not guarantee rational\n(i.e., complete and consistent) collective judgments: the \"discursive paradox\"\n(Pettit 2001).\na a! b b\nIndividual 1 True True True\nIndividual 2 True False False\nIndividual 3 False True False\nMajority True True False\nTable 1: A discursive paradox\n1F. Dietrich, Dept. of Quant. Economics, University of Maastricht, P.O. Box 616, 6200 MD\nMaastricht, The Netherlands; C. List, Dept. of Government, London School of Economics,\nLondon WC2A 2AE, U.K. We thank Klaus Nehring and the anonymous referees for very\ndetailed and helpful comments on this paper.\n1\nIn our example, if individual judgments are as shown in Table 1, a majority\naccepts a, a majority accepts a ! b, and yet a majority rejects b. Although\njudgment aggregation has many similarities to preference aggregation in Con-\ndorcet\u0092s and Arrow\u0092s tradition, judgment aggregation generalizes preference ag-\ngregation2 and faces additional complexities.\nIn particular, a basic fact about Arrowian preference aggregation is the\nfollowing:\nIf, for a given decision problem (speci\u0085ed by the set of alternatives\nto be ranked), majority voting generates irrational collective pref-\nerences for some pro\u0085les of rational individual preferences (which\nhappens just in case there are at least three alternatives), then so\ndoes any preference aggregation function satisfying Arrow\u0092s condi-\ntions (universal domain, weak Pareto, independence of irrelevant\nalternatives, non-dictatorship).\nThus any decision problem susceptible to Condorcet\u0092s paradox is, more gener-\nally, susceptible to Arrow\u0092s theorem. No such fact holds for judgment aggrega-\ntion. Instead we \u0085nd the following:\nEven if, for a given decision problem (here speci\u0085ed by the agenda\nof propositions under consideration), majority voting generates ir-\nrational collective judgments for some pro\u0085les of rational individual\njudgments (which happens just in case the agenda has a minimal\ninconsistent subset of three or more propositions), other judgment\naggregation functions may still guarantee collective rationality while\nsatisfying the counterparts of Arrow\u0092s conditions.\nThus a decision problem susceptible to a discursive paradox need not be sus-\nceptible to the counterpart of Arrow\u0092s theorem. Like most example agendas in\nthe literature, the agenda above is susceptible to a discursive paradox but not\nto an Arrow-style impossibility. Neither the size of the agenda nor the sizes of\nits minimal inconsistent subsets alone determine whether or not an Arrow-style\nimpossibility applies. The logical interconnections between the propositions in\nthe agenda matter in more complex ways. The recent literature on judgment\naggregation has explored this complexity, which also constitutes the motivation\nfor this paper.\nList and Pettit (2002, 2004) formalized judgment aggregation and proved a\n\u0085rst impossibility theorem, strengthened by Pauly and van Hees (2006), Dietrich\n(2007) and Dietrich and List (2007a), which holds for most standard agendas,\nbut imposes a strong condition of systematicity on the aggregation function.\nSystematicity is the conjunction of an Arrow-inspired independence condition\n2As illustrated below, preference aggregation can be formally represented as a special case\nof judgment aggregation by expressing preference relations as binary ranking propositions in\npredicate logic of the form xPy (List and Pettit 2004, Dietrich and List 2007).\n2\n(requiring propositionwise aggregation) and a global neutrality condition (re-\nquiring equal treatment of all propositions). Thus the price for the theorem\u0092s\napplicability to many agendas is the strength of its systematicity condition.\nGiven this problem, several authors have proved impossibility theorems in\nwhich systematicity is weakened to independence (Pauly and van Hees 2006,\nDietrich 2006, G\u00e4rdenfors 2006, Nehring and Puppe 2008, van Hees 2007, Di-\netrich and List 2007a, Dokow and Holzman forthcoming, Mongin forthcoming).\nBut these results exclude many agendas, notably the one in the example above\nand many other standard agendas. This is not because the theorems have not\nbeen proved for these agendas, but because they do not hold for them. Indeed,\nDokow and Holzman (forthcoming), extending an earlier result by Nehring and\nPuppe (2002) in the related \"property space\" model, have identi\u0085ed the weak-\nest agenda conditions for an Arrow-style impossibility with independence (i.e.,\na result where Arrow-inspired conditions imply dictatorship); and these agenda\nconditions are still rather strong, although several oligarchy results are known\nfor weaker agenda conditions (Nehring and Puppe 2008, Dokow and Holzman\nforthcoming).3\nOnce we give up systematicity, are all serious impossibilities restricted to\nspecial agendas? Unfortunately not. We introduce a condition of unbiased\naggregation, inspired by May\u0092s (1952) neutrality condition and much weaker\nby itself than systematicity. Unbiasedness requires an equal treatment of each\nproposition and its negation, but not of any two propositions. For most agen-\ndas, every unbiased judgment aggregation function (with rational inputs and\noutputs) is dictatorial or at least e\u00a4ectively dictatorial. The lesson is that un-\nbiasedness, although in isolation considerably weaker than systematicity, turns\nout to have very similar implications as systematicity. A mathematically related\nearlier result is a theorem by Nehring and Puppe (2005) on strategy-proof social\nchoice functions that are neutral-within-issues, on which we comment later.\nOur result is of interest in light of May\u0092s classic characterization of majority\nvoting (1952), in so far as it shows that, as soon as May\u0092s binary agenda fp;:pg\n3Crucially, for an Arrow-style impossibility result with independence (where the relevant\nconditions imply dictatorship), the agenda must be totally blocked, i.e., it must be possible\nto link any two propositions by a path of \u0091conditional entailments\u0092. Under the di\u00a4erent, yet\nnot fully general condition that the agenda is truth-functional, impossibility results without\nassuming systematicity have been proved (Nehring and Puppe 2008, Dokow and Holzman\nforthcoming), although these are oligarchy results rather than dictatorship results. These\noligarchy results, in turn, may lead us to expect that a condition such as unbiasedness will\nagain generate a dictatorship result. For a review, see also List and Puppe (2009). Agendas\ndescribing standard discursive-dilemma situations, say agendas containing premise proposi-\ntions and a conclusion proposition (and their negations), are typically not totally blocked, and\nonly some of them are truth-functional, depending on the relationship between the premises\nand the conclusion. They are truth-functional, in particular, in two cases: the case in which\nthe conclusion proposition is fully determined (in its truth value) by the premise proposi-\ntions, and the case in which some premise proposition is a material conditional. (We have left\nopen whether the conditional a ! b in our leading example is a material one, i.e., logically\nequivalent to :a_ b, but arguably it is not, in which case the agenda is not truth-functional.)\n3\nis just slightly enriched by additional propositions, May\u0092s possibility turns into\nan impossibility even if May\u0092s monotonicity condition is dropped and anonymity\nis signi\u0085cantly weakened. Our result also applies to (strict) preference aggreg-\nation problems with three or more alternatives: every unbiased social welfare\nfunction with universal domain is e\u00a4ectively dictatorial. Further, our results\ncan be applied to two related aggregation problems: the belief merging problem\ndiscussed in computer science (e.g., Konieczny and Pino-Perez 2002), and the\naggregation of binary evaluations (e.g., Wilson 1975 and Dokow and Holzman\nforthcoming). Throughout this paper we adopt Dietrich\u0092s (2007) general logics\nframework, which extends the model in List and Pettit (2002, 2004).\n2 De\u0085nitions\nLet N = f1; 2; : : : ; ng be a group of individuals (n \u0015 2) required to make\ncollective judgments on logically connected propositions.\nLanguage. We consider a language, given by a non-empty set L of sentences\n(propositions) closed under negation: p 2 L implies :p 2 L, where : denotes\n\"not\". In addition to negation, the language may contain any other logical op-\nerators needed to express the decision problem, such as the classical operators ^\n(\"and\"), _ (\"or\") and! (\"if-then\"), modal operators, subjunctive conditionals,\netc. As usual in logic, every set S \u0012 L is either consistent or inconsistent (not\nboth). Our results require some regularity axioms on the consistency notion\n(valid for many logics, classical or non-classical, propositional or predicate):4\nC1 Pairs fp;:pg \u0012 L are inconsistent (self-entailment)\nC2 Subsets of consistent sets S \u0012 L are consistent (monotonicity).\nC3 ; is consistent, and each consistent set S \u0012 L has a consistent superset T\n\u0012 L containing a member of each pair p;:p 2 L (completability).\nFor example, in a propositional logic, L contains propositions such as a, b,\na ! b, a ^ b, where fa; a ! b;:bg is inconsistent, fa;:(a ^ b)g is consistent,\netc. Various realistic decision problems can be represented in our model, in-\ncluding preference aggregation problems as illustrated below. Call a set S \u0012 L\nminimal inconsistent if it is inconsistent and every proper subset T ( S is con-\nsistent. Call a proposition p 2 L contingent if fpg and f:pg are consistent, a\ncontradiction if fpg is inconsistent, and a tautology if f:pg is inconsistent.\nAgenda. The agenda is a non-empty set X \u0012 L of propositions on which\njudgments are to be made, where X is a union of pairs fp;:pg (with p not itself\n4The conditions C1-C3 can be re-expressed in terms of (equivalent) conditions on the\nentailment relation in L (the conditions L1-L3 in Dietrich 2007, who uses the labels \"I1-I3\"\nfor \"C1-C3\"). The reason is that a set S \u0012 L is consistent if and only if, for no p 2 L, S\nentails p and entails :p.\n4\na negated proposition). IfX is in\u0085nite, we require the logic to be compact : every\ninconsistent set has a \u0085nite inconsistent subset (this holds for many logics). In\nthe example above, the agenda is X = fa;:a; b;:b; a ! b;:(a ! b)g in a\npropositional logic. Notationally, double negations cancel each other out (i.e.,\n::p stands for p).5 A subagenda of the agenda X is a subset Y \u0012 X that is\nitself an agenda, i.e., non-empty and a union of pairs fp;:pg.\nJudgment sets. Each individual i\u0092s judgment set is a subset Ai \u0012 X, where\np 2 Ai means that individual i accepts proposition p. A judgment set Ai\nis rational if it is (i) consistent and (ii) complete in the sense that, for every\nproposition p 2 X, p 2 Ai or :p 2 Ai. Let U be the set of all rational judgment\nsets.6 A pro\u0085le is an n-tuple (A1; : : : ; An) of individual judgment sets.\nAggregation functions. A (judgment) aggregation function is a function F\nthat assigns to each pro\u0085le (A1; : : : ; An) in some domain a collective judgment\nset F (A1; : : : ; An) = A \u0012 X, where p 2 A means that the group accepts\nproposition p. An example is majority voting: here F (A1; :::; An) = fp 2 X :\njfi 2 N : p 2 Aigj > jfi 2 N : p =2 Aigjg for all pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An) in the\ndomain. All our results assume that the aggregation function is a function\nF : Un ! U, that is:\n\u000f F accepts as inputs all possible pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An) of rational individual\njudgment sets (\"universal domain\"), and\n\u000f F generates as outputs rational collective judgment sets (\"collective ra-\ntionality\").\nThis is a demanding rationality requirement on individuals and on the\ncollective; but it is a standard requirement.7 Call aggregation function F\nunanimity-preserving if F (A; :::; A) = A for every unanimous pro\u0085le (A; :::; A)\nin the domain of F . Call an individual i a dictator (and F dictatorial) if\nF (A1; :::; An) = Ai for all pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An) in the domain of F . For any\nsubset Y \u0012 X, call individual i a dictator on Y (and F dictatorial on Y ) if\nF (A1; :::; An) \\ Y = Ai \\ Y for all pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An) in the domain of F .\n3 Unbiasedness\nOur central condition on an aggregation function is inspired by May\u0092s (1952)\ncondition of neutrality:\n5Hereafter, when we write :p and p is already of the form :q, we mean q (rather than\n::q).\n6Some readers may prefer the notation UX for the set of rational judgment sets on the\nagenda X, but since X is assumed to be \u0085xed, there is no risk of ambiguity even without the\nsubscript.\n7Relaxations of full rationality within the logic-based model of judgment aggregation are\nconsidered, for example, in List and Pettit (2002), G\u00e4rdenfors (2006), Dietrich and List\n(2007b), and Dietrich and List (2008).\n5\nUnbiasedness. For any proposition p 2 X and pro\u0085les (A1; : : : ; An); (A\u00031; : : : ;\nA\u0003n) in the domain of F , if [for all individuals i, p 2 Ai if and only if :p 2 A\u0003i ]\nthen [p 2 F (A1; : : : ; An) if and only if :p 2 F (A\u00031; : : : ; A\u0003n)].\nUnbiasedness requires an equal treatment of each proposition p 2 X and\nits negation :p, regardless of other judgments. If we decompose an aggreg-\nation problem into multiple decisions between proposition-negation pairs, it\ncan be interpreted as the application of May\u0092s neutrality condition (1952) to\neach such pair. Unbiasedness is also related to Nehring and Puppe\u0092s (2005)\nneutrality-within-issues.8 Unbiasedness is considerably weaker than List and\nPettit\u0092s (2002) condition of systematicity, which requires an aggregation func-\ntion to be neutral between any two propositions p; q 2 X:\nSystematicity. For any propositions p; q 2 X and pro\u0085les (A1; : : : ; An);\n(A\u00031; : : : ; A\n\u0003\nn) in the domain of F , if [for all individuals i, p 2 Ai if and only\nif q 2 A\u0003i ] then [p 2 F (A1; : : : ; An) if and only if q 2 F (A\u00031; : : : ; A\u0003n)].\nWhile systematicity permits all uniform propositionwise decision methods,\nsuch as majority voting, symmetrical supermajority voting, dictatorships or in-\nverse dictatorships, unbiasedness also permits aggregation functions that apply\ndi\u00a4erent decision criteria to di\u00a4erent propositions but the same criterion to each\nproposition p 2 X and its negation :p. For example, on some pairs p;:p 2 X\none can apply majority voting, on others weighted majority voting, on yet oth-\ners majority voting within some subgroup or dictatorships or erratic decision\nmethods like inverse dictatorships, minority voting, or accepting a proposition if\nand only if it is supported by an odd number of individuals. Unbiasedness also\ndi\u00a4ers from a global neutrality condition based on a permutation \u0019 : X ! X\nof the agenda (e.g., van Hees 2007). It is by itself logically independent from\nindependence, but implies independence under universal domain and collect-\nive rationality (see Lemma 1 below). Systematicity, by contrast, implies both\nindependence and global neutrality.\n4 A \u0085rst impossibility of unbiased aggregation\nOur theorems use two weak agenda conditions. Their precise form is justi\u0085ed\nby the tighness (necessity) of the conditions in our theorems, as shown below.\nFirst, call agenda X non-separable if it cannot be partitioned into two logic-\nally independent subagendasX1 andX2, each containing at least one contingent\nproposition (where X1 and X2 are logically independent if B1 [B2 is consistent\nfor any consistent subsets B1 \u0012 X1 and B2 \u0012 X2). Informally, non-separability\nrequires that the decision problem cannot be split into two logically independ-\nent decision problems \u0096a plausible condition in practice. The agenda in our\n8A neutral-within-issues and strategy-proof social choice function induces an unbiased and\nmonotonic judgment aggregation function.\n6\nexample above and many others are non-separable. But if we extend our ex-\nample agenda by adding a new pair c;:c, where c is an atomic proposition, the\nnew agenda is separable, namely into the old agenda and the binary agenda\nfc;:cg.\nSecond, call agenda X minimally connected if it has these two properties:9\n(i) It has a minimal inconsistent subset Y of size at least three (the non-\nsimplicity condition).\n(ii) It has a minimal inconsistent subset Y such that (Y nZ) [ f:p : p 2 Zg\nis consistent for some set Z \u0012 Y of even size (the even-number negation\ncondition in Dietrich 2007 and Dietrich and List 2007a; equivalent, for\n\u0085nite X, to Dokow and Holzman\u0092s forthcoming algebraic non-a\u00a2 neness\ncondition).\nAll standard example agendas in the judgment aggregation literature are\nminimally connected, including our example agenda above (take Y = fa; a !\nb;:bg in (i) and (ii) and Z = fa;:bg) and agendas representing preference\naggregation problems with three or more alternatives (as discussed below). The\nnotorious exception is X = fa;:a; b;:b; a $ b;:(a $ b)g, where $ is taken\nto be a material biconditional (i.e., a $ b is logically equivalent to (a ^ b) _\n(:a^:b)): (ii) fails since Z does not exist. However, even this agenda becomes\nminimally connected once $ is taken to be a subjunctive biconditional, which\nis arguably more realistic (Dietrich forthcoming): take Y = fa;:b; a $ bg in\n(i) and (ii) and Z = fa; a$ bg. Also the agenda X assumed by List and Pettit\n(2002) \u0096containing distinct atomic propositions a; b and their conjunction a^ b\n\u0096is minimally connected: take Y = fa; b;:(a^b)g in (i) and (ii), and Z = fa; bg.\nTheorem 1 For (and only for) a non-separable minimally connected agenda,\nevery unbiased unanimity-preserving aggregation function F : Un ! U is dic-\ntatorial.\nIn Theorem 1, and also in Theorems 2 and 3 below, the necessity of the\nagenda conditions (the \"only for\") assumes a group of size n \u0015 3. Theorem 1\nimmediately implies the following corollary.\nCorollary 1 For any agendaX (without restriction), every unbiased unanimity-\npreserving aggregation function F : Un ! U is dictatorial on each non-separable\nminimally connected subagenda Y \u0012 X.\nBy Theorem 1, for most agendas, all unbiased aggregation functions (with\nrational inputs and outputs) are degenerate: they are dictatorial or overrule\nunanimities. Thus non-degenerate aggregation functions must favour some pro-\npositions over their negations.\nThis theorem (and part of its proof) is related to Nehring and Puppe\u0092s (2005)\nresults on strategy-proof social choice functions that are neutral-within-issues.\n9The sets Y may or may not di\u00a4er between parts (i) and (ii).\n7\nTranslated into our framework, their results imply that, under further weakened\nagenda conditions (namely dropping property (ii) of minimal connectedness),\nevery aggregation function F : Un ! U that is unbiased and monotonic (hence\nalso unanimity-preserving) is dictatorial. So our result uses weaker aggregation\nconditions but stronger agenda conditions. (This situation is somewhat similar\nto the standard cases in which independence and systematicity are required:\nthere, too, the additional agenda condition (ii) is needed to obtain a dictatorship\nresult without monotonicity. For an overview, see List and Puppe 2009.) Similar\nremarks apply also to our later theorems, which do not even require a unanimity\ncondition.\nTo show the necessity part of Theorem 1 (the \"only for\"), which holds for\ngroup size n \u0015 3, we simply specify counterexamples (\"possibilities\").\nFirst, suppose agenda X is separable, say into subagendas X1 and X2. Then\nan unbiased and unanimity-preserving but not dictatorial aggregation function\nF : Un ! U can be de\u0085ned by\nF (A1; :::; An) = F1(A1 \\X1; :::; An \\X1) [ F2(A1 \\X2; :::; An \\X2),\nwhere F1 and F2 are dictatorships for the agendas X1 and X2, respectively, with\na di\u00a4erent dictator each time.\nNext suppose X violates part (i) of minimal connectedness; so all minimal\ninconsistent sets contain at most two propositions. Then majority voting among\nany non-singleton odd subset of the individuals, for simplicity the \u0085rst three,\ngiven on the universal domain by\nF (A1; :::; An) = fp 2 X : a majority of A1; A2; A3 contains pg,\ngenerates consistent (and complete) judgment sets, hence de\u0085nes an unbiased\nunanimity-preserving aggregation function F : Un ! U that is not dictatorial.\nFinally, suppose X violates part (ii) of minimal connectedness. Then Dokow\nand Holzman\u0092s (forthcoming) parity function among the \u0085rst three individuals,\nde\u0085ned on the universal domain by\nF (A1; :::; An) = fp 2 X : an odd number of A1; A2; A3 contains pg,\ngenerates consistent (and complete) judgment sets (see Dokow and Holzman\nforthcoming; for a non-algebraic proof see Dietrich 2007). So F de\u0085nes an\nunbiased unanimity-preserving aggregation function F : Un ! U that is not\ndictatorial. Crucially, this function is non-monotonic, and, by Nehring and\nPuppe\u0092s result (2005), there cannot exist a monotonic such function, assuming\nthat all the other conditions of the theorem are met.\nThe su\u00a2 ciency proof in Theorem 1 rests on some lemmas. We begin by\nestablishing the standard property of \"independence\" or \"propositionwise ag-\ngregation\".\nIndependence. For any proposition p 2 X and pro\u0085les (A1; : : : ; An); (A\u00031; : : : ;\nA\u0003n) in the domain of F , if [for all individuals i, p 2 Ai if and only if p 2 A\u0003i ]\nthen [p 2 F (A1; : : : ; An) if and only if p 2 F (A\u00031; : : : ; A\u0003n)].\n8\nLemma 1 Every unbiased aggregation function F : Un ! U is independent.10\nProof. Let F be as speci\u0085ed. Consider any p 2 X and any pro\u0085les (A1; :::;\nAn); (A\n\u0003\n1; :::; A\n\u0003\nn) 2 Un in which the same set of individuals C \u0012 N accepts p.\nWe show that p 2 F (A1; :::; An) if and only if p 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n), as required\nby independence. By collective rationality, if p is a tautology, p is contained\nin both F (A1; :::; An) and F (A\u00031; :::; A\n\u0003\nn); if p is a contradiction, p is contained\nin neither of F (A1; :::; An) and F (A\u00031; :::; A\n\u0003\nn). Suppose p is contingent. Then\n:p is also contingent. There exists a pro\u0085le (A01; :::; A0n) 2 Un such that ex-\nactly the individuals in C accept :p. By unbiasedness, p 2 F (A1; :::; An) is\nequivalent to :p 2 F (A01; :::; A0n), which, again by unbiasedness, is equivalent to\np 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n). \u0004\nUsing Lemma 1, we can easily see why Corollary 1 follows from Theorem\n1. Let F : Un ! U be unbiased and unanimity-preserving on some agenda X\n(without restriction). Consider a non-separable minimally connected subagenda\nY \u0012 X. As F is independent (by Lemma 1), F induces a unique aggregation\nfunction F \u0003 for this subagenda: F \u0003 has universal domain relative to agenda Y\n\u0096call this UnY \u0096and is for all (A\n\u0003\n1; :::; A\n\u0003\nn) 2 UnY given by\nF \u0003(A\u00031; :::; A\n\u0003\nn) = F (A1; :::; An) \\ Y , (1)\nwhere (A1; :::; An) is a pro\u0085le in the original domainUn with Ai\\Y = A\u0003i for all\ni; by independence it does not matter which such pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) is chosen.\nThe function F \u0003 inherits from F the properties of unbiasedness, unanimity-\npreservation and collective rationality. So, by Theorem 1, F \u0003 is dictatorial.\nHence, by (1) and independence, F is dictatorial on Y , as required. \u0004\nFor the next lemma, call propositions p; q 2 X connected (in X) if they are\nconditionally dependent: there exist p\u0003 2 fp;:pg and q\u0003 2 fq;:qg such that\nfp\u0003; q\u0003g [ Y is inconsistent for some Y \u0012 X consistent with p\u0003 and with q\u0003.\nAnd call coalition C \u0012 N winning for p 2 X (under F ) if p 2 F (A1; :::; An)\nfor every pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) in the domain with fi : p 2 Aig = C. If an\naggregation function F is independent, it is uniquely determined by the family\n(Cp)p2X , where Cp is the set of coalitions winning for p 2 X. Speci\u0085cally, for all\npro\u0085les (A1; :::; An) in the domain,\nF (A1; :::; An) = fp 2 X : fi : p 2 Aig 2 Cpg.\nLemma 2 Suppose F : Un ! U is unbiased. For any p 2 X, let Cp be the set\nof coalitions winning for p. Then:\n(a) If p 2 X is contingent, Cp = C:p and C 2 Cp , NnC =2 Cp.\n(b) If p; q 2 X are connected and F is unanimity-preserving, Cp = Cq.\n10Unbiasedness does not imply independence without assuming universal domain and col-\nlective rationality.\n9\nProof. Let F : Un ! U be unbiased. By Lemma 1, F is independent.\n(a) Let p 2 X be contingent. To show Cp = C:p, consider any C \u0012 N ,\nand let us prove that C 2 Cp if and only if C 2 C:p. As p is contingent, there\nexist pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An); (A\u00031; :::; A\n\u0003\nn) 2 Un such that C = fi : p 2 Aig = fi :\n:p 2 A\u0003i g. By unbiasedness, p 2 F (A1; :::; An) if and only if :p 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n),\nwhence fi : p 2 Aig 2 Cp if and only if fi : :p 2 A\u0003i g 2 C:p, i.e., C 2 Cp if and\nonly if C 2 C:p.\nTo prove the second part of (a), let C \u0012 N again. As p is contingent,\nthere exists a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) 2 Un such that C = fi : p 2 Aig, hence\nNnC = fi : :p 2 Aig. Now C 2 Cp is equivalent to p 2 F (A1; :::; An), hence to\n:p =2 F (A1; :::; An), hence to NnC =2 C:p, hence to NnC =2 Cp, as shown above.\n(b) Suppose p; q 2 X are connected and F is unanimity-preserving. Then\nthere exist v 2 fp;:pg and w 2 fq;:qg and Y \u0012 X such that (i) each of\nfvg[Y and fwg[Y is consistent, and (ii) fv; wg[Y is inconsistent. It follows\nthat (iii) each of fv;:wg [ Y and f:v; wg [ Y is consistent. By (iii), v and w\nare contingent. So, by part (a), it is su\u00a2 cient to show that Cv = Cw. We only\nshow that Cv \u0012 Cw, as the converse inclusion is analogous. Suppose C 2 Cv.\nBy (iii) and universal domain there exists a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) 2 Un such that\nfv;:wg[Y \u0012 Ai for all i 2 C and f:v; wg[Y \u0012 Ai for all i 2 NnC. We have\nv 2 F (A1; :::; An) as Cv contains C, and Y \u0012 F (A1; :::; An) as each Cy, y 2 Y ,\ncontains N by unanimity-preservation. Because of fvg [ Y \u0012 F (A1; :::; An)\nand (ii), w =2 F (A1; :::; An). So NnC =2 Cw, and hence C 2 Cw by part (a), as\nrequired. \u0004\nWe now show that non-separability of the agenda X is equivalent to another\nstructural property. Call propositions p; q 2 X indirectly connected if there exist\np1; :::; pk 2 X with p1 = p and pk = q such that any two neighbours pt; pt+1 are\nconnected (as de\u0085ned above). And call agenda X indirectly connected if any\ntwo contingent propositions p; q 2 X are indirectly connected.\nLemma 3 An agenda is non-separable if and only if it is indirectly connected.\nProof. We may assume without loss of generality that all p 2 X are con-\ntingent, because if X also has non-contingent members then X is indirectly\nconnected if and only if the subagenda fp 2 X : p is contingentg is indirectly\nconnected, and X is non-separable if and only if fp 2 X : p is contingentg is\nnon-separable (if X has only non-contingent members, the claim is trivial).\nFirst, assume X is separable. Then there is a partition of X into logically\nindependent subagendas X1; X2. Consider any p 2 X1 and q 2 X2. We show\nthat p and q are not indirectly connected. Suppose for a contradiction that\np1; :::; pm 2 X (m \u0015 1) are such that p = p1, q = pm, and pt and pt+1 are\nconnected for any t 2 f1; :::;m \u0000 1g. As p1 2 X1 and pm 2 X2, there must\nbe a t 2 f1; :::;m \u0000 1g such that pt 2 X1 and pt+1 2 X2. As pt and pt+1\nare connected, there are p\u0003t 2 fpt;:ptg, p\u0003t+1 2 fpt+1;:pt+1g and Y \u0012 X such\nthat (i) fp\u0003t ; p\u0003t+1g [ Y is inconsistent and (ii) each of fp\u0003tg [ Y and fp\u0003t+1g [ Y\n10\nis consistent. By (ii), each of the sets B1 := (fp\u0003tg [ Y ) \\ X1 and B1 :=\n(fp\u0003t+1g [ Y ) \\ X2 is consistent. So B1 [ B2 is consistent, as X1 and X2 are\nlogically independent. But\nB1 [B2 = [(fp\u0003tg [ Y ) \\X1] [ [(fp\u0003t+1g [ Y ) \\X2]\n= [(fp\u0003t ; p\u0003t+1g [ Y ) \\X1] [ [(fp\u0003t ; p\u0003t+1g [ Y ) \\X2]\n= (fp\u0003t ; p\u0003t+1g [ Y ) \\ [X1 [X2] = fp\u0003t ; p\u0003t+1g [ Y;\nwhich is inconsistent by (ii), a contradiction.\nSecondly, let X be not indirectly connected. We show that X is separable.\nBy assumption, there exist p; q 2 X that are not indirectly connected. De\u0085ne\nX1 := fr 2 X : p and r are indirectly connectedg and X2 := XnX1. Since p is\nindirectly connected to itself (as p is contingent), p 2 X1. Further, q 2 X2. So\neach of X1 and X2 is non-empty. Moreover, each of X1 and X2 is closed under\nnegation (like X). If follows that X1 and X2 are subagendas of X.\nWe complete the proof by showing thatX1 andX2 are logically independent.\nSuppose for a contradiction that B1 \u0012 X1 and B2 \u0012 X2 are each consistent but\nthat B1 [ B2 is inconsistent. As X is \u0085nite or the logic compact, there exists\na minimal inconsistent subset B \u0012 B1 [ B2. We have neither B \u0012 B1 nor\nB \u0012 B2, since otherwise B would be consistent. So there exist r 2 B \\X1 and\ns 2 B\\X2. Propositions r and s are connected, because, putting Y := Bnfr; sg,\nfr; sg[Y = B is inconsistent, but each of frg[Y = Bnfsg and fsg[Y = Bnfrg\nis consistent by B\u0092s minimal inconsistency. This is a contradiction. \u0004\nEssentially by combining Lemma 3 with part (b) of Lemma 2, we now deduce\nsystematicity (which brings us into the terrain of known results of the literature).\nLemma 4 For a non-separable agenda X, every unbiased unanimity-preserving\naggregation function F : Un ! U is systematic.\nProof. Let X and F be as speci\u0085ed. Consider propositions p; q 2 X and\npro\u0085les (A1; : : : ; An); (A\u00031; : : : ; A\n\u0003\nn) 2 Un, such that (*) for all individuals i,\np 2 Ai , q 2 A\u0003i . We show that (**) p 2 F (A1; :::; An), q 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n). If\np and q are both contingent, then they are indirectly connected by Lemma 3,\nhence have the same set of winning coalitions by iterated applications of part (b)\nof Lemma 2; so, using (*), we obtain (**). If p or q is a tautology then, by indi-\nvidual rationality and (*), all Ai contain p and all A\u0003i contain q; so by unanimity-\npreservation (and independence) p 2 F (A1; :::; An) and q 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n), im-\nplying (**). Finally, if p or q is a contradiction then, by individual rationality\nand (*), all Ai contain :p and all A\u0003i contain :q; so by unanimity-preservation\n(and independence) :p 2 F (A1; :::; An) and :q 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n), which again\nimplies (**) (by collective rationality). \u0004\nLemma 4 together with the following known result implies the su\u00a2 ciency\npart of Theorem 1, hence completes the proof.\n11\nLemma 5 (Dietrich and List 2007a) For a minimally connected agenda, every\nsystematic unanimity-preserving aggregation function F : Un ! U is dictat-\norial.\nTo make the present argument self-contained, we sketch the proof of this\nresult. Let the agenda X and the function F be as speci\u0085ed. By systematicity,\nthere is a set C of (\"winning\") coalitions C \u0012 N such that\nF (A1; :::; An) = fp 2 X : fi : p 2 Aig 2 Cg for all (A1; :::; An) 2 Un.\nSteps (a)-(e) below show the existence of a dictator i, i.e., C = fC \u0012 N : i 2 Cg.\n(a) N 2 C, by unanimity-preservation.\n(b) C 2 C , NnC =2 C, as exactly one member of any p;:p 2 X is accepted.\n(c) [C 2 C & C \u0012 C\u0003 \u0012 N ] ) C\u0003 2 C. Suppose C 2 C & C \u0012 C\u0003 \u0012 N .\nLet Y \u0012 X be as in part (ii) of \"minimal connectedness\". For illustrative\npurposes, let Y be binary, say Y = fp; qg (see Dietrich and List 2007a for\nthe general case). Then fp; qg is inconsistent, but fp;:qg; f:p; qg; f:p;:qg are\neach consistent. Consider a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) 2 Un such that fp;:qg \u0012 Ai\nif i 2 C, f:p;:qg \u0012 Ai if i 2 C\u0003nC, and f:p; qg \u0012 Ai otherwise. As C 2 C,\np 2 F (A1; :::; An). So, by fp; qg\u0092s inconsistency, :q 2 F (A1; :::; An). Hence\nC\u0003 2 C.\n(d) C;C\u0003 2 C ) C \\ C\u0003 2 C. Let C;C\u0003 2 C. Let Y \u0012 X be as in part (i)\nof \"minimal connectedness\". Consider distinct p; q; r 2 Y . Consider a pro\u0085le\nin which each individual accepts all s 2 Y nfp; q; rg, and rejects exactly one of\np; q; r: all i 2 C \\C\u0003 reject p, all i 2 C\u0003nC reject q, and all others reject r. By\n(a), all s 2 Y nfp; q; rg are collectively accepted. As exactly all i 2 C\u0003 (2 C)\naccept r, the collective accepts r. As at least all i 2 C (2 C) accept q, the\ncollective accepts q by (c). So, as Y is inconsistent, the collective accepts :p.\nHence C \\ C\u0003 2 C.\n(e) C = fC \u0012 N : i 2 Cg for some individual (dictator) i. By (d), ~C :=\n\\C2CC 2 C. So ~C 6= ; (as ; =2 C by (a) and (b)). ~C must be singleton, say\n~C = fig: otherwise ~C could be partitioned into two non-empty coalitions C;C 0,\nwhere NnC;NnC 0 2 C by (b), hence Nn ~C=(NnC) \\ (NnC 0) 2 C by (d), and\nso ~C =2 C by (b), a contradiction. By fig 2 C and (c), fC \u0012 N : i 2 Cg \u0012 C.\nThis inclusion also implies the converse inclusion by (b). \u0004\n5 Two impossibilities without the unanimity\ncondition\nTo strengthen the impossibility of unbiased aggregation further, we now show\nthat even without requiring unanimity-preservation we still run into impossib-\nility. We prove two theorems, both of which merely assume the aggregation\nfunction F : Un ! U to be unbiased. In the \u0085rst result, we strengthen The-\norem 1\u0092s agenda condition in such a way that unanimity-preservation can be\n12\nderived ; so Theorem 1 applies and implies dictatorship. In the second result, we\nkeep Theorem 1\u0092s mild agenda condition, and show that an equally undesirable\nvariant of dictatorship follows: an \"e\u00a4ective dictatorship\".\nGiven that we now only require the aggregation function F : Un ! U to\nbe unbiased, it may seem that at least some such F can overrule at least some\nunanimous judgments. Surprisingly, for many agendas this is not the case. First\nassume the agenda X is asymmetric: there exists a consistent set A \u0012 X such\nthat f:p : p 2 Ag is inconsistent (Dietrich 2007, Dietrich and List 2007a).\nThen F cannot overrule unanimous judgments for every p 2 A: otherwise, if\nall individuals accept all p 2 A, the collective accepts all :p (with p 2 A),\na collective inconsistency. But F may still overrule unanimous judgments on\nsome p 2 XnA. To prevent any overruling of unanimity, the agenda must be\nlocally asymmetric: for every subagenda Y \u0012 X, there exists a consistent set\nA \u0012 X that becomes inconsistent by negating those propositions that are in Y\n(i.e., (AnY )[f:p : p 2 A\\Y g is inconsistent). (Local asymmetry is a stronger\ncondition than asymmetry: by taking Y = X, the former implies the latter.)\nExamples are discussed shortly.\nLemma 6 For (and only) for a locally asymmetric agenda, every unbiased ag-\ngregation function F : Un ! U is unanimity-preserving.\nProof. First suppose F : Un ! U is unbiased and not unanimity-preserving.\nThen Z := fp 2 X :N is not a winning coalition for pg is non-empty. Z is closed\nunder negation: if p 2 Z then p is contingent, and hence :p 2 Z by part (a)\nof Lemma 2. So Z is a subagenda. To show that X is not locally asymmetric,\nwe show that, for every consistent set A \u0012 X, also (AnZ) [ f:p : p 2 A \\ Zg\nis consistent. It obviously su\u00a2 ces to show this for the case that A is complete.\nSo let A \u0012 X be complete and consistent, i.e., A 2 U. By de\u0085nition of Z,\nF (A; :::; A) contains all p 2 AnZ and all :p with p 2 A \\ Z, the latter because\nby part (a) of Lemma 2 the empty coalition is winning for :p. So F (A; :::; A)\ncontains all members of the set (AnZ) [ f:p : p 2 A \\ Zg. Hence this set is\nconsistent, as required.\nConversely, suppose X is not locally asymmetric. Then there is a subagenda\nZ \u0012 X such that (*) for all consistent sets A \u0012 X, also (AnZ)[f:p : p 2 A\\Zg\nconsistent. Let i be an individual and F the aggregation function with universal\ndomain Un that makes i a dictator on XnZ and an inverse dictator on Z; that\nis, for all (A1; :::; An) 2 Un,\nF (A1; :::; An) = (AinZ) [ f:p : p 2 Ai \\ Zg.\nBy construction, F is unbiased, because i is a dictator on p if and only if i\nis a dictator on :p, and generates complete judgment sets. It also generates\nconsistent ones by (*); hence F : Un ! U. But, as required, F is not unanimity-\npreserving, because for all (A; :::; A) 2 Un we have F (A; :::; A) = (AnZ)[f:p :\np 2 A \\ Zg 6= A. \u0004\n13\nThis lemma together with Theorem 1 implies our next theorem.\nTheorem 2 For (and only for) a non-separable, minimally connected and loc-\nally asymmetric agenda, every unbiased aggregation function F : Un ! U is\ndictatorial.\nAs in the case of Theorem 1, a corollary follows (using Lemma 1):\nCorollary 2 For any agenda X (without restriction), every unbiased aggreg-\nation function F : Un ! U is dictatorial on each non-separable, minimally\nconnected and locally asymmetric subagenda Y \u0012 X.\nTheorem 2 applies to our example agenda X = fa;:a; b;:b; a ! b;:(a !\nb)g, which is locally asymmetric, as we now check by going through the sub-\nagendas Y \u0012 X. For Y = fa;:ag, let A = f:a; a ! b;:bg (as A is con-\nsistent but fa; a ! b;:bg is not). For Y = fb;:bg, let A = fa; a ! b; bg.\nIn general, for any subagenda Y , let A \u0012 X be the unique set for which\n(AnY ) [ f:p : p 2 A \\ Y g = fa; a ! b;:bg, i.e., let A be the set arising\nfrom fa; a ! b;:bg by negating all p 2 A \\ Y . The so-constructed set A is\nindeed consistent since fa; a ! b;:bg becomes consistent after negating one,\ntwo or all of its member(s), assuming here that \"!\" is a subjunctive implication\n(see Dietrich forthcoming). If, less realistically, \"!\" is a material implication\n(i.e., a! b is equivalent to :a_ b), then this way to construct A does not work\nfor all subagendas Y ,11 but other constructions work.\nBut Theorem 2 does not apply to the strict preference aggregation prob-\nlem discussed below: this agenda is not locally asymmetric, in fact not even\nasymmetric simpliciter because inverting (negating) rational strict preferences\nyields rational strict preferences. This illustrates that the strong impossibility\nof Theorem 2 (\"unbiasedness implies dictatorship\") applies to fewer agendas\nthan the impossibilities of Theorem 1 above and Theorem 3 below.\nNow we turn to our last impossibility result, which requires neither the\nunanimity condition of Theorem 1 nor the extra agenda condition of Theorem\n2.\nFor any subset Y \u0012 X, call individual i an inverse dictator on Y if\nF (A1; :::; An) \\ Y = Y nAi for all pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An) in the domain. Call indi-\nvidual i an e\u00a4ective dictator (and F e\u00a4ectively dictatorial) if there is a parti-\ntion of X into subsets X+; X\u0000 (each one possibly empty) such that individual\ni is a dictator on X+ and an inverse dictator on X\u0000; that is, F (A1; :::; An) =\n(X+ \\Ai) [ (X\u0000nAi) for all pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An) in the domain. For any subset\nY \u0012 X, call individual i an e\u00a4ective dictator on Y (and F e\u00a4ectively dictatorial\non Y ) if there is a partition of Y into subsets Y+; Y\u0000 (each one possibly empty)\n11Because fa; a ! b;:bg stays inconsistent after negating a ! b as well as one or both of\na and :b (e.g., fa;:(a! b); bg is inconsistent as the negated material implication :(a! b)\nis equivalent to a ^ :b). Under the subjunctive interpretation of \"!\", by contrast, the set\nfa; a! b;:bg becomes consistent as soon as at least one of its members is negated.\n14\nsuch that individual i is a dictator on Y+ and an inverse dictator on Y\u0000; that\nis, F (A1; :::; An) \\ Y = (Y+ \\ Ai) [ (Y\u0000nAi) for all pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An) in the\ndomain.\nTheorem 3 For (and only for) a non-separable minimally connected agenda,\nevery unbiased aggregation function F : Un ! U is e\u00a4ectively dictatorial.\nAgain, a corollary follows (using Lemma 1):\nCorollary 3 For any agenda X (without restriction), every unbiased aggreg-\nation function F : Un ! U is e\u00a4ectively dictatorial on each non-separable\nminimally connected subagenda Y \u0012 X.\nNote a further corollary. Call aggregation function F anonymous if, for any\npro\u0085les (A1; : : : ; An) and (A\u001b(1); :::; A\u001b(n)) in the domain, where \u001b : N ! N is a\npermutation, F (A1; : : : ; An) = F (A\u001b(1); : : : ; A\u001b(n)).\nCorollary 4 If the agenda has a non-separable and minimally connected sub-\nagenda (possibly the entire agenda itself), there exists no anonymous unbiased\naggregation function F : Un ! U.\nCorollary 4 signi\u0085cantly strengthens List and Pettit\u0092s (2002) theorem by\nindividually weakening the conditions generating the impossibility: namely by\nweakening systematicity to unbiasedness and weakening the agenda condition.\nWithout weakening systematicity to unbiasedness, the agenda condition in List\nand Pettit\u0092s result can be weakened further than in Corollary 4, namely to\nminimal connectedness alone (Dietrich and List 2007a).\nTheorem 3 and Corollary 4 are particularly interesting in light of May\u0092s\nclassic characterization of majority voting (1952). Translated into our termin-\nology, May\u0092s theorem (without indi\u00a4erence) states that, for any binary agenda\nX = fp;:pg, an aggregation function F : Un ! U is majority voting if and\nonly if it is anonymous, unbiased and monotonic.12 Our result shows that, if\nthe agenda is just slightly enriched beyond binariness, May\u0092s theorem collapses\ninto an impossibility result even if monotonicity is dropped and anonymity is\nweakened to the requirement that there be no e\u00a4ective dictator.\nIn Theorem 3, the necessity of the agenda conditions (the \"only for\") fol-\nlows from the aggregation functions constructed earlier to show necessity in\nTheorem 1. These aggregation functions are not only non-dictatorial but also\nnot e\u00a4ectively dictatorial.\nRegarding su\u00a2 ciency, we \u0085rst show that the aggregation function F in The-\norem 3 induces a unanimity-preserving aggregation function bF :\n12Where n is odd. An aggregation function F is monotonic if, for all individuals i and\nall pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An); (A1; :::; A\u0003i ; :::; An) in the domain di\u00a4ering only in i\u0092s judgment set, if\nF (A1; :::; An) = A\n\u0003\ni then F (A1; :::; A\n\u0003\ni ; :::; An) = A\n\u0003\ni .\n15\nLemma 7 Suppose F : Un ! U is unbiased. De\u0085ne, for each p 2 X,\nbp := \u001a p if N is a winning coalition for p;:p if N is not a winning coalition for p.\nThen:\n(a) For any p 2 X, c:p = :bp and bbp = p.\n(b) For any A \u0012 X, A is consistent if and only if fbp : p 2 Ag is consistent.\n(c) The aggregation function bF with universal domain Un de\u0085ned by\nbF (A1; :::; An) = fbp : p 2 F (A1; :::; An)g\nsatis\u0085es unbiasedness, unanimity-preservation and collective rationality.\n(d) For every p 2 X,\nCp =\n( bCp if bp = p\nfC \u0012 N : C =2 bCpg if bp = :p,\nwhere Cp (bCp) is the set of coalitions winning for p under F ( bF ).\nProof. Let F be as speci\u0085ed.\n(a) Suppose p 2 X. N is winning for p if and only if N is winning for :p; if\np is contingent this follows easily from unbiasedness (see also part (a) of Lemma\n2); if p is not contingent it holds because N is winning for every tautology and\n(vacuously) for every contradiction. As N is winning for p if and only if N\nis winning for :p, we have bp = p if and only if c:p = :p, whence c:p = :bp.\nMoreover, if bp = p then bbp = bp = p, and if bp = :p then bbp = c:p = :bp = ::p = p.\n(b) LetA \u0012 X. By (a) it is su\u00a2 cient to show one direction of the implication.\nLet A be consistent. Then there exists a set B 2 U such that A \u0012 B. For each\np 2 A, F (B; :::; B) contains bp because:\n- if N 2 Cp then bp = p 2 F (B; :::; B);\n- if N =2 Cp then p =2 F (B; :::; B), and so bp = :p 2 F (B; :::; B).\nBy fbp : p 2 Ag \u0012 F (B; :::; B); fbp : p 2 Ag is consistent.\n(c) For any (A1; :::; An) 2 Un, bF (A1; :::; An) is\n- consistent by (b) and the consistency of F (A1; :::; An);\n- complete as, for any p 2 X, if p =2 bF (A1; :::; An) then bp =2 F (A1; :::; An) by\np = bbp, hence :bp 2 F (A1; :::; An), and so bF (A1; :::; An) contains c:bp = c:p = :p.bF is unanimity-preserving: for any p 2 X and any (A1; :::; An) 2 Un with\np 2 Ai for all individuals i,\n- if p 2 F (A1; :::; An), then N is a winning coalition for p under F by\nindependence (see Lemma 1), hence bp = p, and so p 2 bF (A1; :::; An);\n- if p =2 F (A1; :::; An), then :p 2 F (A1; :::; An), hence c:p 2 bF (A1; :::; An),\nwhere c:p = :bp = ::p = p (since bp = :p).\nTo show that bF is unbiased, consider any p 2 X and (A1; :::; An); (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n)\n2 Un such that p 2 Ai if and only if :p 2 A\u0003i . Then (*) bp 2 Ai if and only if\n16\n:bp 2 A\u0003i . Now p 2 bF (A1; :::; An) is equivalent to bp 2 F (A1; :::; An), by de\u0085nition\nof bF and as p = bbp. The latter is equivalent to :bp 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n), by (*) and as\nF is unbiased. This, in turn, is equivalent to c:bp 2 bF (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n) by de\u0085nition\nof bF , i.e., to :p 2 bF (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n) as c:bp = c:p = :p by part (a).\n(d) Let p, Cp and bCp be as speci\u0085ed.\nFirst let bp = p. Then Cp = bCp, because, for any pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) 2 Un,\np 2 F (A1; :::; An) is equivalent to bp 2 bF (A1; :::; An) (using that bbp = p), i.e., to\np 2 bF (A1; :::; An).\nNow let bp = :p. To show that Cp = fC \u0012 N : C =2 bCpg, we consider any\nC \u0012 N , and prove that C 2 Cp is equivalent to C =2 bCp. By bp = :p, p is\ncontingent, and so there exists a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) 2 Un such that fi : p 2\nAig = C. Now C 2 Cp is equivalent to p 2 F (A1; :::; An), which is equivalent\nto bp 2 bF (A1; :::; An) (as in case 1), i.e., to :p 2 bF (A1; :::; An), hence to p =2bF (A1; :::; An), and so to C =2 bCp, as required. \u0004\nTo prove (the su\u00a2 ciency part of) Theorem 3, let X be non-separable and\nminimally connected, and let F : Un ! U be unbiased. Let bF and bp (for\nany p 2 X) be de\u0085ned as in Lemma 7. By part (c) of Lemma 7, bF satis\u0085es\nall conditions required in Theorem 1. So bF is dictatorial by Theorem 1, say\nwith dictator i. Hence, by part (d) of Lemma 7, i is under F a dictator on\nZ+ := fp 2 X : bp = pg and an inverse dictator on Z\u0000 := fp 2 X : bp = :pg\n(= XnZ+). So F is e\u00a4ectively dictatorial. \u0004\n6 An illustration\nTo illustrate the generality of our result, we apply Theorem 1 to the aggregation\nof (strict) preferences, represented in the judgment aggregation model. We\nconsider the agenda X = fxPy;:xPy 2 L : x; y 2 K with x 6= yg, where\n\u000f L is a predicate logic for representing preferences, with\n\u0096 a two-place predicate P (representing strict preference), and\n\u0096 a set of constants K = fx; y; z; :::g with jKj \u0015 3 (representing al-\nternatives).\n\u000f A is consistent if and only if A [ Z is consistent in the standard sense\nof predicate logic, with Z de\u0085ned as the set of rationality conditions on\nstrict preferences.13\nFor details of this construction, see Dietrich and List (2007a) (also List and\nPettit 2004). Each rational judgment set Ai \u0012 X uniquely represents a strict\n(i.e., asymmetric, transitive and connected) preference relation \u001fi\u0012 K \u0002 K,\n13Formally, Z contains (8v1)(8v2)(v1Pv2 ! :v2Pv1) (asymmetry),\n(8v1)(8v2)(8v3)((v1Pv2 ^ v2Pv3) ! v1Pv3) (transitivity), (8v1)(8v2)(: v1 = v2 !\n(v1Pv2 _ v2Pv1)) (connectedness) and, for any distinct constants x; y 2 K, :x = y\n(exclusiveness of alternatives).\n17\nwhere, for any x; y 2 K, xPy 2 Ai if and only if x \u001fi y. For example,\nif K = fx; y; zg, the preference relation x \u001fi y \u001fi z is represented by the\njudgment set Ai = fxPy; yPz; xPz;:yPx;:zPy;:zPxg.\nThe agenda X thus de\u0085ned is non-separable. It is also minimally connected\n(take Y = fxPy; yPz; zPxg in parts (i) and (ii) and Z = fxPy; yPzg, where\nx; y; z 2 K are distinct alternatives). So Theorems 1 and 3 apply (whereas\nTheorem 2 does not apply, as X is not locally asymmetric, in fact not even\nasymmetric). Let us state Theorem 3 for this agenda:\nCorollary 5 For the agenda X = fxPy;:xPy 2 L : x; y 2 K with x 6= yg,\nevery unbiased aggregation function F : Un ! U is e\u00a4ectively dictatorial.\nWhat does this mean in the language of preference aggregation? A judg-\nment aggregation function F : Un ! U uniquely represents a social welfare\nfunction with universal domain (taking strict preferences as input and output).\nUnbiasedness, applied to such a social welfare function, becomes the condi-\ntion that, for any pair of alternatives x; y 2 K and any two preference pro\u0085les\n(\u001f1; :::;\u001fn), (\u001f\u00031; :::;\u001f\u0003n) in the universal domain, if [for all individuals i, x \u001fi y\nif and only if y \u001f\u0003i x] then [x \u001f y if and only if y \u001f\u0003 x]. Corollary 5 thus\nimplies that every unbiased social welfare function with universal domain is\ne\u00a4ectively dictatorial. No unanimity (Pareto) condition is needed. Although\nthis result could also be obtained in standard social choice theory (for example,\nvia Wilson\u0092s 1972 result on social choice without the Pareto principle), the\nobservation that it is a corollary of our new result on judgment aggregation\nshould illustrate the result\u0092s generality. Interestingly, unlike Wilson\u0092s and Ar-\nrow\u0092s theorems, our result continues to hold even if the rationality conditions\non preference relations are relaxed to acyclicity alone (giving up full transitiv-\nity and connectedness). The reason is that the agenda X, as speci\u0085ed above,\nremains non-separable and minimally connected in a modi\u0085ed predicate logic\nobtained by weakening the conditions in the set Z above so as to capture acyc-\nlicity alone.14\n7 Concluding remarks\nIn judgment aggregation, we face not only a trade-o\u00a4 between di\u00a4erent con-\nditions on an aggregation function for any given agenda, as in preference ag-\ngregation, but also a trade-o\u00a4 between these conditions and the generality of\nthe agendas for which they can be met by an aggregation function. We have\nproved three impossibility results. Two of them (Theorems 1 and 3) apply to all\nstandard example agendas in the literature, including the agendas representing\npreference agggregation problems. This generality is surprising, as we do not\n14Formally, Z then contains, for any sequence of distinct constants x1; x2; :::; xk 2 K; the\nproposition (x1Px2 ^ ::: ^ xk\u00001Pxk) ! :xkPx1 (no cycle over x1; x2; :::; xk) and, for any\ndistinct constants x; y 2 K, :x = y (exclusiveness of alternatives).\n18\nimpose the requirement of systematicity, a condition often criticized as being\ntoo strong. We impose the weaker condition of unbiasedness: a May-type neut-\nrality condition applied to each proposition-negation pair, without requiring\nneutrality across pairs.\nOur results show that, for many agendas, unbiasedness leads to dictatorship,\nor at least to e\u00a4ective dictatorship. Thus the implications of unbiasedness are\nsurprisingly similar to those of systematicity, despite the fact that unbiased is\nby itself considerably weaker than systematicity. Our agenda conditions (non-\nseparability, minimal connectedness, and in Theorem 2 also local asymmetry)\nare tight: agendas that violate any of them avoid the impossibility. Theorems 2\nand 3 require no unanimity, monotonicity or other responsiveness condition,15\nunlike many related impossibility results of social choice. But we retain full\nrationality of individuals and the group. (If we give up full rationality, un-\nbiasedness does become satis\u0085able together with our other conditions, e.g., by\nsymmetrical special majority voting, as discussed in List and Pettit 2002 and\nDietrich and List 2007b, and by other oligarchic rules, e.g., G\u00e4rdenfors 2006,\nDietrich and List 2008.)\nOur results appear signi\u0085cant, as they imply that, in virtually all realistic\njudgment aggregation problems, any aggregation function with commonly ac-\ncepted properties must favour some propositions over their negations.\n8 References\nDietrich, F.
