The convergence of different media into a single networked\ndigital domain, and the rapidly expanding accessibility of such media, both driven by\nmarket forces, is tempting many HE institutions to develop an online presence. True\n'virtual universities', i.e., completely online, are still the exception and there are strong\nreasons why traditional, face-to-face, universities should resist the pressure to develop\na virtual alter ego. Nevertheless, online delivery and support of teaching and learning\noffers many potential benefits to students of such institutions, not least of which\ncould be freedom from the constraints of conventional attendance patterns.\nSince significant new resources are unlikely to be available to most UK institutions to\ndevelop online operations, existing internal resources need to be re-engineered to bring\nthem into line behind the chosen venture. Small scale, bottom-up experiments are unlikely\nto succeed in re-engineering sufficient resources to achieve lasting institution-wide change.\nRe-engineering the campus requires a culture change, which needs to be led from the top,\nthrough an unbroken chain of champions down through the organization, including the\nresource managers at middle management level. A minimum of two years needs to be\nallowed for evaluation of the impact of change. During that initial period central co-\nordination of, and support for, individual projects is essential to ensure delivery against\ntargets of time, cost and quality. Nevertheless institutional change can best be achieved by\nencouraging local ownership, which means allowing local autonomy and avoiding\npremature imposition of standards.\nChange\nHigher Education in the UK and elsewhere is under considerable pressure to change as a\nresult of:\n30\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\n\u2022 rapid growth in student numbers\n\u2022 increased variability of student intakes\n\u2022 declining resources\n\u2022 concerns about quality of graduates\n\u2022 increased pressures for public accountability\n\u2022 concerns about the relevance to industry\n\u2022 increased competition from other countries and commercial interests\n\u2022 increased availability and reduced costs of networked media (Brown, 1997;\nCunningham et al., 1998).\nThese factors are driving universities to reinvent themselves. Traditional behavioural\nmodels of education are giving way to more learner-centred, collaborative experiences\n(Hardy, 1997). Learner-centred approaches accommodate learner needs and acknowledge\nthat learners may have other calls on their time, leading to more flexible delivery and\nsupport strategies which allow learners to shift the time, place and pace of learning.\nNetwork technologies such as the Internet, email and computer-based and video-\nconferencing can assist with this process and at the same time they open up opportunities\nfor learners to seek out and utilize learning resources offered by other parties.\nCoping strategies\nComplexity in the environment can be reduced by increasing the span of control of the\norganization (Emery and Trist, 1969). Collaborative ventures such as the University of the\nHighlands and Islands in Scotland (Cornwell, 1997), or Western Governors University in\nthe USA (Romer, 1997) are examples of a trend towards mega-universities identified by\nDaniel (1997). 'Virtual' universities such as Western Governors (http:\/\/www.wgu.edu),\nCalifornia Virtual University (http:\/\/www.california.edu) and Colorado University 'CU\nOnline' (http:\/\/www.cuonline.edu) are another way of expanding the span of influence,\nwithout requiring a physical presence. However, much of so-called online education still\ndepends on video-conferencing, books, residential schools, etc. (Ebeling and Bistayi, 1997;\nPhilips and Yager, 1998).\nTen good reasons not to go virtual\n1. The costs of developing a virtual online presence are not yet fully understood but are\nconsiderable. In a climate of diminishing resources, investment capital has to be\ndiverted from existing functions.\n2. Competing organizations need to be able to respond rapidly and flexibly to new market\nrequirements and competitive threats. Yet quality learning resource materials and\nlearning support systems take longer to develop than traditional teaching.\n3. Classroom teaching can be modified much more readily than resource-based learning\nwith its longer development timescales.\n31\nStephen Brown Reinventing the university\n4. The infrastructure requirements of the virtual institution are quite different from those\nof traditional institutions and require considerable capital investment.\n5. Although there is evidence that the economics of purely online education can be made\nto work, for a traditional university to make the transition to predominantly mixed\nmode would require that institution to run both systems concurrently, with all the\nassociated costs and inevitable tensions. . . . . . . .\n6. Staff attitudes to curriculum change on this scale are often a significant barrier (Brown,\n1997).\n7. Student needs: not all learners are comfortable with independent learning, particularly\namong the traditional 18-22-year-old cohort of established universities (Hutton, 1998).\n8. Reallocation of resources could weaken the traditional side of the operation at a time\nwhen competition is increasing. \u2022: : \u2022 . \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022:\n9. It can be argued that there are no blueprints for converting an existing university to\nonline mode on an institutional scale, or at least, knowledge of how to do so has not\nyet been unequivocally demonstrated.\n10. Traditional universities have strengths that are lost in cyberspace: physical locations\nthat provide a respite from the everyday demands of home and work; facilities and\nequipment that are not readily simulated in virtual space, people with whom to\nsocialize, enjoy physical contact, chance encounters, etc.\nAn Electronic Campus\nInstead of developing a virtual presence, De Montfort University has decided to create an\nElectronic Campus, in order to: . . .\n1. Enhance flexibility of access t\u00f3 learning on campus. - ,\n2. Develop a position that can lead to collaborative ventures with other organizations.\nDuring 1997\/8 the goal has been to:\n\u2022 Develop a substantial body of HTML compliant teaching, learning and assessment\nmaterials, which can be accessed readily by students on campus and traded with other\ninstitutions.\n\u2022 Put in place appropriate learning support systems that encourage and facilitate peer\ngroup interaction and staff-student exchanges, independent of time and specific\nuniversity location.\n\u2022 Achieve a rapid return on investment of resources.\n\u2022 Re-engineer existing resources to achieve the above.\nThe Electronic Campus is employing a combination of three possible implementation\nstrategies:\n\u2022 In-house development.\n\u2022 Embedding of materials developed elsewhere.\n32\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\n\u2022 Collaboration with other organizations to jointly develop new materials.\nPump-priming funds have been made available centrally for faculties to bid against. A\nproforma guides faculty staff through a set of questions designed to encourage them to\nconsider key issues and address the selection criteria applied to proposals.\nStaff IT training courses have been restructured to provide basic technical authoring skills\nusing Microsoft Office products and more advanced Internet training on HTML\nauthoring, web site development, Internet communications and information search\ntechniques. Project teams are also offered short courses on the use of specific software\napplications used within the Electronic Campus.\nImpact\nFaculty\nApplied Sciences\nArt & Design\nBusiness & Law\nComputing & Engineering\nLearning Development\nHealth & Community Studies\nHumanities & Social Sciences\nTotal\nProjects\n6\n5\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n27\nTable I : Distribution of faculty projects\nSo far there are 27 different Electronic Campus projects, ranging across all faculties and at\nall levels including FE, undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing professional\ndevelopment. Some of the projects are complete courses, some are full modules and others\nare parts of modules. The first of these projects will start delivering to students during the\nfirst semester of 1998.\nTimescale\nFrom the initial decision to establish an Electronic Campus (June 1997) through to delivery\nof the first products (October 1998) has taken 16 months. Key milestones on the way are\noutlined below.\nJuly 1997: Establishment of a project director. Individual briefings between the project\ndirector, the Pro Vice-Chancellor with overall responsibility for the initiative and each of\nthe heads of the 14 academic schools, to explain the goals and invite project proposals.\nSeptember 1997: First proposals received. Establishment of a formal steering committee to\nformulate policy and strategy.\nDuring 1997\/8 the 14 schools were reorganized into 6 faculties and in January 1998 a\n33\nStephen Brown Reinventing the university\ncentral team was put in place to interface with the new faculties. The role of these Learning\nDevelopment Managers (LDMs) has been to help specific faculties to:\n\u2022 Develop appropriate teaching, learning and assessment strategies.\n\u2022 Develop teaching and learning proposals for internal and external funding.\n\u2022 Identify and obtain resource-based learning materials produced elsewhere.\n\u2022 Develop and implement learning support strategies and systems.\n\u2022 Identify and meet staff development needs in relation to implementation of the\nElectronic Campus.\nSuccessful project bids result in the formation of Project Teams within faculties. LDMs\nprovide ongoing assistance and a link back to the central production resources (graphic\ndesign, courseware authoring, programming, desktop publishing, audio, video and\nphotography, digitizing, print, etc.).\nBy April 1998 it was apparent that there was a need for an intermediate level of\nmanagement between the Steering Group and the LDMs. An Operational Group of senior\nmanagers with responsibilities for key functions such as libraries and IT infrastructure was\ncreated to determine implementation uses and strategies.\nIn May 1998 a Web site was launched to support and publicize the initiative in conjunction\nwith internal newsletter articles (13 to date).\nSeptember 1998: Hardware and software standards agreed.\nCosts\nIt is not easy to cost a venture such as the Electronic Campus because it is not being\ndeveloped ab initio. A lot of the costs would have been incurred anyway by the institution\nas part of its normal running costs. The following figures are an attempt to tease out some\nadditional costs directly attributable to the initiative.\nNot surprisingly the infrastructure costs are a significant element. A figure of \u00a3400 per\nstudent includes an allowance for network hardware and software installation, servers,\naccess terminals and technical support. It is assumed for the purposes of the calculation\nthat the ratio of terminals to students is 1 to 5 and that all staff have access to their own\ndesktop machine.\nThe other significant costs are for learning materials and support systems development,\nincluding the costs of bought-in software. On average, each project costs around \u00a333,000,\nsplit on a 60:40 ratio between faculties and the centre.\nA cost that is easy to overlook is the amount of time spent by senior staff determining\npolicy strategy and implementation plans. It is estimated that the Electronic Campus has\ncost approximately \u00a38,000 p.a. so far pro rata.\nProblems\nAs the number of projects under way has increased, it has been increasingly difficult to\n34\nAiT-J Volume 6 Number 3\nkeep track of progress and to maintain the level of input necessary to guarantee minimum\nstandards of quality. This highlights a trade-off to be made between embedding in local\npractice and quality control.\nInevitably there have been barriers to progress, which in some cases have resulted in\nslippage against project schedules. This experience highlights the need to retain some\nflexibility in delivery methods.\nThere are conflicting pressures for and against the early adoption of standards for hardware,\ndevelopment tools, delivery software, conferencing software, etc. Standards can reduce costs,\nstaff development needs and product development times. Offset against this is the risk of\ncommitting too early to inappropriate tools and resistance to standards by staff interested in\npursuing different avenues of development. This highlights the need to balance central co-\nordination against the need for local autonomy and to postpone making commitments to\nstandards until there is a high degree of confidence in their effectiveness and relevance.\nThere is also the potential for conflict with other organizational standards, for example,\ncomputing policies designed to maximize network integrity and data security may be at\nodds with the need for open and flexible access to learning materials, assessments and\npersonal performance records. This highlights the need to ensure close collaboration\nbetween Electronic Campus developments and relevant operational arms of the university\nat the highest possible management levels. 'Bottom up' implementations are unlikely to be\nsuccessful on an institutional scale.\nThe resource re-engineering model adopted here depends on being able to realign an\nincreasing proportion of existing resources behind the new activities. Without convincing\nevidence of the benefits to staff, students, departments and the institution as a whole, it is\nvery difficult to obtain the support required at resource manager level to sustain\ndevelopment. Evidence of this kind takes time to collect and present. This highlights the need\nfor senior management commitment over an initial development and implementation phase\nof at least two years.\nLessons learned\nMoney is not enough\nAside from the infrastructure costs, the major Electronic Campus investment has been staff\ntime, as buyout of staff from other normal duties and recruitment of additional staff.\nMoney is not enough however to ensure adequate human resources. In our experience the\nfaculty staff taking a lead in Electronic Campus have typically been heavily committed to\nother key activities as well, such as student recruitment, research, university consultancy,\nadministration, etc. It has been difficult for such people to allocate as much time to\nElectronic Campus projects as they themselves would like. Other rewards need to be put in\nplace such as recognition of the importance of teaching innovation and excellence.\nChampions at all levels\nBottom-up approaches tend to founder on the rocks of competing policies and standards\ncentral to different parts of the institution. Staff eventually move on to other things and\nbusiness returns to usual practices. On the other hand, a top-down, management-led,\napproach can be frustrated at the level of middle management where hard choices have to\n35\nStephen Brown Reinventing the university\nbe made about resource allocations in the face of strong competing pressures. In order for\ninnovation successfully to permeate the entire organization there have to be champions at\nall levels, ensuring an unbroken chain of commitment to the vision (Brown, 1997).\nFaith versus evidence\nExperiments need faith in the probability of desirable outcomes. On the other hand,\nwholesale institutional adoption of change needs convincing evidence. It takes time to\nbuild the evidence in a given organizational context and so experiments have to be given a\nreasonable period in which to prove themselves. In our experience, two years is an absolute\nminimum period for development and trialling.\nCentral co-ordination versus local autonomy\nTop-down management is essential to ensure central co-ordination at a high enough level\nwithin the organization to ensure that inter-departmental differences do not present\nimpossible barriers to innovation. Yet without a strong sense of local ownership in the\nfaculties themselves, innovation is unlikely to be pursued wholeheartedly or sustained in\nthe long term. Commitment is most likely to stem from local control over decision-making,\nso the temptation to control everything from the centre needs to be resisted.\nStandards versus flexibility\nFrom this it follows that while standards can be helpful in the early stages, they should not\nbe imposed at the expense of constraining flexibility and creativity on the part of those\nexpected to develop and implement the innovation. As the innovation gathers momentum\nand supporters, the need for greater co-ordination and agreement on standards can be\nallowed to emerge collectively.\nKeep it simple\nA university is a complex organizational form, which has evolved over hundreds of years.\nThe Electronic Campus has had to be made operational within a year. On this timescale it\nhas been important to make everything as easy as possible for the staff and students\ninvolved. The simplest, most familiar and most readily available tools have been selected to\nfacilitate this process.\nReferences\nBrown, S. (ed.)
