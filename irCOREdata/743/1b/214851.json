This consent can be\nwithdrawn at any time before the embryo transfer\nprocedure. Withdrawal of consent by one genetic parent\ncan result in the other genetic parent losing the\nopportunity to have their own genetic children. We argue\nthat offering couples only one type of consent\nagreement, as happens at present, is too restrictive. An\nalternative form of agreement, in which one genetic\nparent agrees to forego the right to future withdrawal of\nconsent, should be available alongside the current form\nof agreement. Giving couples such a choice will better\nenable them to store embryos under a consent\nagreement that is appropriate for their circumstances.\nAllowing such a choice, with robust procedures in place\nto ensure the validity of consent, is the best way to\nrespect patient autonomy.\nHuman embryos created by in-vitro fertilisation\n(IVF) can be cryopreserved in order to have the\nopportunity of using them in future fertility\ntreatment. The individual circumstances of people\nchoosing to have embryos cryopreserved vary\nconsiderably. In routine IVF treatment, it is normal\nfor several embryos to be created, while in the UK\nthe number of embryos transferred to a woman at\none time usually does not exceed two. IVF thus\ncommonly produces spare embryos that can be\nstored for use in subsequent treatment cycles.\nHowever, it is also possible for embryos to be\ncreated solely for future use, with no intention to\nproduce an immediate pregnancy. For example, if\na woman is to undergo medical treatment that risks\ndamaging her fertility, she and her partner may\nchoose to use IVF specifically to create embryos\nwith a view to their future use, after the medical\ntreatment is completed. Cryopreservation of\nembryos has historically been more successful than\ncryopreservation of unfertilised oocytes,1 and\ndespite recent progress in oocyte storage tech-\nniques2 this is generally believed to remain the case.\nIn comparison, if a man is to undergo treatment\nthat risks damaging his fertility, samples of his\nsperm can generally be stored for future use in\na process that is effective, usually non-invasive and\ninexpensive. A man with cryopreserved sperm and\na fertile female partner will generally have a higher\nchance of achieving genetic parenthood than\na woman with either cryopreserved embryos or\ncryopreserved oocytes and a fertile male partner.\nCouples who store embryos may later separate,\nleading to possible disagreements about the use of\ntheir embryos. Since 1990, UK law has stipulated\nthat embryos cannot be stored or transferred\nwithout the ongoing consent of both genetic\nparents, and consent can be withdrawn any time\nbefore the embryos are to be used.3 This rule applies\nuniversally, regardless of people\u2019s circumstances or\nwishes at the time the embryos are created. The\nlaw was tested by the case of Natallie Evans.4 5 In\n2001, Evans and her then fianc\u00e9, Howard Johnston,\nhad embryos created from their gametes and then\ncryopreserved, before she underwent urgent cancer\ntreatment that included the removal of her ovaries.\nEvans\u2019 relationship with Johnston subsequently\nended and he withdrew consent for the continued\nstorage of the embryos. Evans opposed the\ndestruction of the embryos and embarked on a legal\nbattle that ended in the Grand Chamber of the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, where she lost\nher case and, thereby, her sole remaining chance of\nhaving her own genetic children.6\nEvans\u2019 predicament sparked a lively debate about\nconsent rules,7e9 particularly in view of the\nopportunity for change afforded by the lengthy\nreview process that was eventually to lead to the\nHuman Fertilisation and Embryology Act (2008).\nFrom October 2009, if one genetic parent with-\ndraws consent to continued storage of embryos,\na 12-month cooling-off period must be observed.\nDuring this period, embryos cannot be destroyed\nunless both parties consent.10 This provision both\nallows time for counselling and discussion of the\nchanged consent (if the parties will engage), and\nremoves the technical illegality of maintaining\nembryos in storage when it is known that one\nparty has withdrawn consent, during the time that\nthe other party is being contacted and notified by\nthe fertility clinic. It does not, however, end the\nvulnerability of a woman in Evans\u2019 position to her\npartner withdrawing consent. Even if her partner\nwished to commit to a form of legal agreement that\nprecludes his subsequent withdrawal of consent,\nthe law does not allow him to do this. Evans had\nargued that this restriction of the kinds of\ncommitments that individuals might make in these\ncircumstances was a breach of their human rights.\nIf a man wished to reassure a woman that her\nembryos would always be available for her, she\nsuggested, then it was perverse to prevent him\nfrom doing so because of the \u2018primacy of consent\u2019.\nThis argument did not convince the courts, which\ndetermined that this was an area in which it was\nfor parliament to legislate and in which a generous\nmargin of appreciation was appropriate.6 11 12 In\nthis paper, we accept that this is properly a matter\nfor parliament and we set out the case for an\nalternative form of consent.\n1Clinical Sciences Research\nInstitute, Warwick Medical\nSchool, University of Warwick,\nCoventry, UK\n2Centre for Philosophy of\nNatural and Social Science,\nLondon School of Economics\nand Political Science, London,\nUK\n3Kent Law School, University of\nKent, Kent, UK\n4Clinical Sciences Research\nInstitute, Warwick Medical\nSchool, University of Warwick,\nCoventry, UK\nCorrespondence to\nDr Peter D Sozou, Centre for\nPhilosophy of Natural and Social\nScience, London School of\nEconomics and Political Science,\nHoughton Street, London WC2A\n2AE, UK;\np.sozou@lse.ac.uk\nThe three authors contributed\nequally to this paper.\nReceived 17 September 2009\nRevised 16 December 2009\nAccepted 22 December 2009\nThis paper is freely available\nonline under the BMJ Journals\nunlocked scheme, see http:\/\/\njme.bmj.com\/site\/about\/\nunlocked.xhtml\n230 J Med Ethics 2010;36:230e233. doi:10.1136\/jme.2009.033373\nLaw, ethics and medicine\n group.bmj.com on June 8, 2010 - Published by jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF\nCONSENT\nSuppose that the UK were to adopt an alternative consent law,\nspecifying that once fertilisation has occurred, the genetic\nmother has sole control over the use of the embryos. This would\nallow a woman in Evans\u2019 situation to maintain her future\npotential to be a genetic mother, as far as is medically possible,\nwithout being dependent on the continuation of the relation-\nship with her partner. There is, however, an unavoidable trade-\noff between different forms of irreversibility: although allowing\na man the option of withdrawing consent to the transfer of\nembryos by necessity involves allowing a woman in Natallie\nEvans\u2019 position to lose her chance of becoming a genetic mother,\nstating that a man cannot withdraw consent means that he is\nirreversibly committed to the possibility of genetic fatherhood\nfrom the moment of fertilisation. These considerations have\nbeen aired in the literature discussing the Evans case.4 5 7e9\nIt seems to us that there are reasonable arguments on both\nsides, with no overwhelming argument in favour of one type of\nagreement that should lead us comprehensively to reject the\nother in all circumstances. It could be argued that the type of\nagreement in which either partner can withdraw consent before\nembryo transfer is relatively more appealing when the embryos\nare created as part of routine IVF treatment and both partners\nhave future fertility prospects, whereas the type of agreement in\nwhich one partner cannot withdraw consent after fertilisation is\nrelatively more appealing in cases in which the embryos repre-\nsent the other partner \u2019s only remaining prospect of genetic\nparenthood. Not all treatment situations, however, fall neatly\ninto one or other category. For example, if a woman is towards\nthe upper age limit for producing viable eggs (typically in her\nlate 30s or early 40s), then discarding embryos produced when\nshe was younger will result in her prospects of future genetic\nparenthood being considerably reduced.\nWhen couples have a complex range of medical and social\ncircumstances, we believe that the most important consider-\nation of all in determining the appropriate form of consent\nagreement for a given couple is the preference of the two indi-\nviduals concerned.\nOUR PROPOSAL\nWe propose that, when embryos are to be created and there is\na prospect of cryopreservation of some or all of the embryos,\ncouples be offered a choice of agreement about their future use.\nOne option would be that consent can be withdrawn by either\ngenetic parent at any time up to embryo transfer, exactly as at\npresent. We propose a second, additional option in which one\ngenetic parent can agree to cede control of the embryos to the\nother. Under this option, it would be up to the genetic parentwho\nretained control to determine in future whether any of the\nembryos are transferred, subject to the prevailing regulations for\ntreatment; the other genetic parent would not have a veto over\ntheir use. Couples would agree, before fertilisation, whether they\nchoose to share control over the future use of embryos, or alter-\nnatively, one of them will have sole control. In the event of the\ngenetic father having sole control, he would be able to seek\na surrogate mother to carry the embryos to term. However, it is\nlikely that inmost agreements inwhichoneparent has sole control\nthis would be the genetic mother, as she would commonly have\nmore limited future fertility options than her partner (with\nNatallie Evans\u2019 situation representing an extreme example of this).\nThe greater invasiveness of assisted conception methods for\nwomen, in comparison with men, may also have an influence.9\nThere are precedents for allowing people a choice of the type\nof agreement in cooperative matters: under English law, for\nexample, two adults buying a property together can choose\nwhether to do so as joint tenants or as tenants in common. Our\nproposal does not remove any options currently open to people\nwishing to store embryos for future use. It simply creates an\nextra option that they may choose should they both agree to it.\nWhereas an agreement in which one genetic parent has sole\ncontrol over the future transfer of embryos might seem to\noperate to that genetic parent\u2019s advantage, in some situations it\nmay also be to the other genetic parent\u2019s benefit to be able to\nsign away his or her legal right later to withdraw consent for the\nfuture use of embryos. Suppose a woman facing the imminent\nloss of her fertility would like to have embryos created with her\npartner, but (in the light of Evans\u2019 misfortune) is unwilling to do\nso if he retains the right to withdraw consent. Then it may be in\nher partner \u2019s interest to sign an agreement in which he cedes\ncontrol of the embryos to her. The scope for a person to benefit\nfrom making a commitment can be shown in formal rational\nchoice models of strategic interactions.13\nOn the basis of the above considerations, we suggest that\nthere is a strong case in favour of allowing couples a choice over\nthe future control of stored embryos. We see two possible\nobjections on fundamental grounds of principle that could be\nmade against it and now consider each of these in turn. We also\nassess the possible practical considerations arising from our\nproposal.\nPOSSIBLE OBJECTIONS\nThe first objection concerns harm to a third partydeither the\nchild itself or society as a whole.14 It is likely that our proposal\nwould result in some instances in which a child is born when its\ngenetic parents are no longer together, when the child would not\notherwise have been born. The child welfare objection to our\nproposal would then be that, given these circumstances of\nconception, it would be better for the child not to have been\nborn. But whether or not one believes that a child\u2019s circum-\nstances are better if its genetic parents are together, it is hardly\nconvincing to claim that a child whose genetic parents separate\nbefore his or her birth has a life not worth living.\nFurthermore, research indicates that children born to single\nmothers who conceive by donor insemination perform well\nagainst socioeconomic and educational indicators.15 16 Similarly,\nchildren born from cryopreserved embryos are likely to be born\ninto households whose average socioeconomic position is higher\nthan for births in society as a whole. They would, by definition,\nbe planned pregnancies and wanted babies, and would be likely\nto enjoy high levels of welfare and be unlikely to make\na disproportionately negative contribution to society.\nIn short, then, the available empirical evidence does not\nsupport the objection that such children would experience poor\nwelfare or would cause harm to society at large. A further\nresponse might also be found in reference to current UK law and\naccepted practice in fertility treatment. The Human Fertilisation\nand Embryology Act (2008) removed the requirement that\nclinicians must consider the \u2018need for a father \u2019 for children\ncreated by fertility treatment, replacing it with consideration of\ntheir need for \u2018supportive parenting\u2019. Furthermore, many\nfertility clinics in the UK routinely and legally treat single\nwomen. It would be incongruous to ban agreements in which\none genetic parent cedes control over future embryo transfer on\nthe grounds that resulting children might be born to a parent\nwho has separated from her partner, while allowing the\nJ Med Ethics 2010;36:230e233. doi:10.1136\/jme.2009.033373 231\nLaw, ethics and medicine\n group.bmj.com on June 8, 2010 - Published by jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \ndeliberate assisted conception of children who are expected at\nthe time of fertilisation to be born into single parent families.\nThe second objection to allowing a person to cede control over\nembryos to his or her partner is that it is wrong to allow\nsomeone to sign away his or her rights to future control over\nsuch an intimate choice. The thought here would be that there\nis something so deeply significant and personal about repro-\nductive choices that the law should preserve individuals\u2019 rights\nto change their minds, even if so doing overrides their current\nwishes. In other words, it would be argued that in this situation\nit is so important to preserve a person\u2019s future autonomy that\nthey should be denied the right to make a choice that limits their\nfuture options. The extent, however, to which the law should\nconstrain a person\u2019s choices for their own good is a matter of\ndebate. There are various views about exactly when such\nrestrictions can be justified;17 18 however, it is generally held that\nsuch restrictions are more difficult to justify in circumstances in\nwhich a person is acting voluntarily and knowledgeably.\nFurthermore, as we have noted already, the mandatory preser-\nvation of one genetic parent\u2019s right to veto the future use of\nembryos is not costless; on the contrary, it results in an enforced\nvulnerability of the other genetic parent to the possible future\nloss of the option to use the embryos in fertility treatment.\nWe believe that any concerns about people acting voluntarily\nand knowledgeably would be better addressed by strengthening\nconsent procedures than by simply not allowing choice. To argue\nthat an agreement in which a person voluntarily cedes control\nover the future transfer of embryos can lead to that person being\nforced to become a genetic parent against his or her will is not\nvalid if he or she freely gave consent, having been well informed\nof the implications of the agreement. We note also that in sexual\nintercourse men regularly lose control of their genetic material at\nthe moment of ejaculation and, although there may be some\nsympathy for the idea that a man has moral interests in\na pregnancy, men have not been afforded any legal rights (either\nof veto or even consultation) in abortion decisions.\nUltimately, any decision about whether the law should fail to\nallow an agreement with the aim of protecting an individual\u2019s\nbest interests or their future autonomy is as much a matter of\nvalues as of empirical facts. We would tend to agree with\nDworkin19 that, if it is proposed that the law should deny\npeople choices for their own good, the onus must be on showing\nwhy the choice should not be allowed. We see no reasonable\nbasis for forbidding a genetic parent of embryos from signing\naway the future right to withdraw consent over their use if he or\nshe does this freely and knowledgeably.\nPRACTICALITIES\nIf a choice of agreements was introduced, one practical concern\nmight be that this will introduce additional work for fertility\nclinics. However, clinics are already required to demonstrate\nrigorous procedures for providing good quality information and\nrecording patients\u2019 decisions. Indeed, the UK Human Fertilisa-\ntion and Embryology Authority provides forms specifically for\nthe purpose of clearly documenting patient consent decisions. To\nenhance the consenting process, individual advice to each of the\npartners may be beneficial, in contrast to the focus on \u2018couple-\ncentred\u2019 treatment that prevailed before the 2008 Act. The\nrevised Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Code of\nPractice (8th edition), applicable from 1 October 2009, places\nmore emphasis on individuals than couples. Another possible\nconcern is that the consent process might take longer than at\npresent. However, it is generally regarded as good practice to\nallow couples as much time as they need to reach a comfortable\nconclusion. They would then be in a strong position to decide\nbetween themselves their preferred arrangements for the future\nuse or disposal of embryos arising from their genetic material.\nIt would of course be possible to allow a greater range of\npossible agreements. Increasing the number of types of agree-\nment recognised in law increases the chance that a couple will\nfind an agreement ideally tailored to their needs, but also\nincreases the complexity of the decision and the risk of litigation\narising from difficulties in the precise interpretation of each type\nof agreement. We believe that the limited increase in choice that\nwe are advocating will result in overall benefits that far exceed\nthe costs. Whether or not increasing people\u2019s options beyond\nthis would be beneficial overall is less clear.\nA second practical consideration concerns time limits over\nwhich an agreement about the use of embryos would apply. It\nwould be possible to stipulate that in an agreement in which one\npartner has sole control, there is no time limit over the duration\nof sole control, other than any statutory limits for embryo\nstorage. Alternatively, there could be a specific time limit within\nwhich the non-controlling partner would be able to use the\nembryos, but if he or she wished to use them outside this limit,\na new agreement or renewal of the original agreement would be\nrequired from the non-controlling partner.\nCONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO DONOR GAMETES\nWe have so far considered embryos created by two genetic\nparents who are partners. When a gamete donor is used in the\nUK, by law the donor has the same right to withdraw consent\nbefore the use of the gametes, or embryos resulting from them,\nas does a partner.10 In our opinion, a distinction can be made,\nhowever, between two different categories of gamete donors.\nThe first category is those who are anonymous to the recipients\nat the time of treatment (children created by fertility treatment\nin the UK from April 2005 using donated gametes have a statu-\ntory right to be given identifying information about the donor\nwhen they reach the age of 18 years). Withdrawal of consent by\nsuch anonymous sperm donors has occurred in the UK, with\nserious consequences for patients, including the destruction of\nembryos.20 These donors have neither financial obligations nor\nany social connection to the recipients or resulting children, yet\nthe destruction of embryos may have a devastating impact on\nthe recipients. Moreover, whereas people withdrawing consent\nbecause of the breakdown of their own relationships can at least\nidentify a cause within their own lives, patients experiencing an\nanonymous donor \u2019s withdrawal of consent are victims of what\nis to them an arbitrary event over which they have no control.\nGiven all these considerations, we believe that there may be\na case for imposing limits on the circumstances under which\nanonymous gamete donors should be allowed to withdraw\nconsent; however, this proposition needs a more detailed\nexamination than can be presented in the present article.\nThe other category of gamete donors is those who are known\nto the recipients at the time of donation. In many such cases,\nthe donor is a relative or close friend. This leads to the possibility\nof a material change in the donor \u2019s social relationship to\na recipient after embryos have been created but before they have\nbeen transferred in an IVF treatment cycle. The arguments for\ndifferent forms of consent agreement for cryopreserved embryos\nare therefore similar to those previously considered for couples\nusing their own gametes, and there is again a case for offering\na choice of consent agreements. Allowing joint control between\nthe donor and the other genetic parent is one logical option;\n232 J Med Ethics 2010;36:230e233. doi:10.1136\/jme.2009.033373\nLaw, ethics and medicine\n group.bmj.com on June 8, 2010 - Published by jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nanother is allowing the donor to cede control to the other\ngenetic parent at the time embryos are created. However,\nbecause there are potentially three interested partiesdthe donor,\nthe other genetic parent and the genetic parent\u2019s partnerdan\nadditional option could be to allow the donor to transfer his or\nher control to the other genetic parent\u2019s partner.\nFurther research into the incidence of and reasons for with-\ndrawal of consent by gamete donors,20 and its implications for\nrecipients, siblings, half-siblings, donors and their families would\nbe useful. Nevertheless, we believe that there is a case for\nconsent rules for gamete donors to be examined as part of\na general review of consent laws.\nCONCLUSION\nThe present legal framework in the UK allows only a single type\nof consent agreement for the future use of cryopreserved\nembryos. We propose allowing people a choice of agreement. We\nhave discussed the advantages of our proposal and possible\narguments against it, and concluded that our proposal better\nrecognises and protects individual autonomy than the current\nlegal framework. We also suggest that the current system\nparticularly disadvantages women, whose biological investment\nin reproduction is more substantial than that of men, and who\nare more vulnerable to the possible loss of future genetic\nparenthood as a result of withdrawal of consent by another\nparty. Whereas both men and women could choose an agree-\nment that offered the decision about the use of the embryos to\ntheir partner, and the proposal itself is gender neutral, it is likely\nthat the introduction of a choice of consent agreement would\nparticularly benefit women.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Luc Bovens, Anne Slowther\nand an anonymous referee for comments on this work.\nFunding PDS was supported by a Wellcome Trust VIP Fellowship.\nCompeting interests GMH is an external adviser to the Human Fertilisation and\nEmbryology Authority and is scientific director of the Centre for Reproductive Medicine\nat University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust.\nProvenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\nREFERENCES\n1.
