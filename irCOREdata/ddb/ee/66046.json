Change over time in level of tense arousal was \nsignificantly positively associated with changes over time in systolic blood pressure \n(SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), but not TC.  A change in hedonic tone \nwas significantly associated with a change in SBP (an increase in negative affect was \nassociated with an increase in SBP), but not in DBP or TC.  There were no sex \ndifferences in associations of mood with SBP or TC.  However, increases in tense \narousal and negative affect were significantly associated with an increase in DBP for \nwomen, but not men.   \n \nKey words: blood pressure, cholesterol, mood, stress, multilevel models, sex \ndifferences.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3\n  \nMany of the main psychosocial factors implicated in the pathogenesis of \ncardiovascular disease, such as social isolation, personality traits, job strain, clinical \nanxiety and depression (Hemingway and Marmot, 1999), are likely to act at least \npartly through their effects on affective state or mood (Feldman et al., 1999; \nKubzansky and Kawachi, 2000). It has also been suggested that known links \nbetween socioeconomic status and ill-health, including cardiovascular disease, are \nmediated partly through negative emotions (Gallo and Matthews, 1999). While it \nmay be that stressors exert additional direct physiological influences via mechanisms \nthat do not involve conscious psychological processes, the role of conscious affective \nstate has been accorded primacy in the literature.  Mood is believed to have a direct \neffect on the sympathetic adrenal medullary and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal \ncortical neuroendocrine axes, which influence both blood pressure and serum lipid \nlevels (Henry, 1982; Gallo and Matthews, 1999).  \nLongitudinal repeated measures studies provide an attractive design for \nassessing links between mood and cardiovascular risk factors.  Each individual acts \nas his or her own control, so that concerns about between-person differences in the \nreporting of affect are unnecessary.  However, little attention has been given to \ndirectly testing whether changes, or within-person variation, in affective states \npredict changes in cardiovascular risk factors, partly because of the problems \ninvolved in analyzing time-varying within-person covariation using standard \nstatistical techniques. Schwartz and Stone (1998) have shown that multilevel models \nprovide a powerful new tool to handle such analyses and some recent studies have \ntaken advantage of this analytical method.  Most of this work has investigated links \nbetween changes in momentary affective state and ambulatory blood pressure during \nthe course of a day or, at most, a few days. Such studies have shown that short-term \n 4\n  \nchanges in mood are associated with changes in blood pressure (Schwartz, Warren & \nPickering, 1994; Kamarck et al., 1998; Jacob et al., 1999). Only a few studies have \nassessed whether longer-term changes in mood are also associated with changes in \nblood pressure or serum lipids. Brondolo, Rosen, Kostis & Schwartz (1999) found no \nassociation between changes in self-reported negative affect and changes in blood \npressure in 54 mildly hypertensive men whose blood pressure was taken repeatedly \nover a period of several months. Using other statistical methods, McCann and \ncolleagues found a significant positive association between changes in perceived \nstress and total cholesterol (TC) in a 4-month study of 14 men and women (McCann, \nWarnick & Knopp, 1990). However, in a subsequent, larger study of men and \nwomen (N=173) they found no association between changes in perceived stress and \nseveral different serum lipids or blood pressure when comparing assessments made \nat times of normal versus high workload during a 2-year period (McCann et al., \n1999). Similarly, Niaura et al. (1991) reported no association between changes in \nperceived stress and serum lipid levels over several months in their three separate \nstudies of 16-40 men and women. None of these studies controlled for the effect of \nchanges in weight on blood pressure or serum lipids, despite the fact that weight is \nknown to covary over time with blood pressure (Gerber et al., 1999) and serum lipids \n(Siervogel et al., 1998), and controlling for body mass index (BMI) is standard in \ncross-sectional studies. It is likely that controlling for BMI would reduce the error \nvariance in these models, perhaps allowing a marginally significant effect of mood to \nbe detected.  \nThere has been some discussion about the relative effects of arousal versus \nnegative affect on blood pressure (Jacob et al., 1999). Arousal and hedonic tone (the \nlatter also known as valence, and referring to positive versus negative affect) are \n 5\n  \noften considered independent dimensions of mood, which together can be used to \ndefine a wide variety of affective states (Russell, 1979). Kamarck et al. (1998) found \nthat both negative affect (assessed by ratings of sad, frustrated, stressed and upset i.e. \na mixture of high and low arousal negative affect terms) and neutrally connotated \nhigh arousal (alertness versus tiredness) were associated with elevated ambulatory \nblood pressure. Gellman et al. (1990), Schwartz et al. (1994), and Jacob et al. (1999) \nall found that ambulatory blood pressure was raised when arousal of either positive \nor negative valence was reported. Thus the evidence suggests that any kind of \nemotional arousal, but perhaps not change in affect not involving arousal, results in \nan increase in blood pressure.  However, this issue is not yet resolved, and no such \ncomparisons have been conducted for serum lipids. \nThere may be gender (socially constructed) or sex (biologically determined) \ndifferences in associations between arousal, hedonic tone, blood pressure and serum \nlipids.  In particular, results of laboratory studies have often, but not always, shown \nsmaller systolic blood pressure (SBP) responses to standard stressors in women than \nin men (Stoney, Davis & Matthews, 1987). Laboratory studies have also shown \nsmaller SBP responses in premenopausal women or women taking hormone \nreplacement therapy, compared to postmenopausal women not taking hormone \nreplacement therapy (e.g. Saab, Matthews, Stoney & McDonald, 1989; del Rio et al., \n1998).  Differences in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) responses have been less \nfrequently observed. These results have been interpreted as suggesting that estrogen \nmay act to reduce systolic blood pressure responses to stressors in women compared \nto men (Stoney et al., 1987; Light, Girdler, West & Brownley, 1998; Pollard, 1999). \nHowever, it is also possible that women\u2019s affective responses to many of the \nstandard laboratory stressors differ to those of men.  Since sex differences in the \n 6\n  \ndirect effects of negative mood or arousal on blood pressure have not been assessed, \nthese laboratory studies do not necessarily test whether equal changes in mood have \nthe same consequences for blood pressure in men and women (Pollard, 2001b). \nEcological studies that have investigated sex differences in associations between \nmood and ambulatory blood pressure have failed to find differences for either SBP or \nDBP (Schwartz et al., 1994; Kamarck et al., 1998). Less research has been conducted \nwith respect to sex differences in serum lipid responses, but Stoney, Matthews, \nMcDonald & Johnson (1988) and Niaura, Stoney & Herbert (1992) suggest that men \nmay show bigger responses to stressors (again, affect per se has not been assessed) \nthan women. \nIn this paper we use multilevel models to investigate the longitudinal (within-\nperson) relationship of mood with blood pressure and TC, each assessed 4 times over \nan 18-month period in a sample of healthy local government employees. Two \nassessments took place before and two took place after a workplace reorganisation \nwhich affected all employees studied.  The present analyses, focusing on within-\nperson associations of mood with blood pressure and TC, do not rest on exposure to \na common stressor, although it is clear that the stressor enhanced negative mood, \nwith distress at its highest level at the second assessment, a time of considerable \nuncertainty about future employment prospects (Pollard, 2001a).  \nWe measured both tense arousal and hedonic tone in order to test the hypothesis \nthat only negatively connoted arousal (high scores on the tense arousal scale), and \nnot negative valence per se (as assessed by the hedonic tone scale), is related to \nblood pressure and, since similar mechanisms are invoked, TC. As noted above, \nchanges in BMI are known to predict changes in blood pressure and serum lipids and \nour analyses therefore controlled for BMI. The effect of season was also controlled \n 7\n  \nin the analyses, since the importance of seasonal changes in blood pressure and TC \nin this data-set have previously been demonstrated (Pollard, 2001a). In addition we \ntested for any sex differences in the relationships of affect to blood pressure and \ncholesterol. \n \nMethods \nParticipants \nVolunteers were sought from employees of five local councils (providers of \nlocal government services) which were being obliged by legislative changes to \nundergo large-scale reorganisation.  Together, the councils employed 25,000 full-\ntime staff.  Information about the study was distributed using posters and a staff \nnewsletter, and volunteers not suffering from cardiovascular disease or diabetes were \nrequested to return a reply slip to the researchers. In total 282 volunteers participated \nin the first assessment. At the second assessment 247 (88%) returned. Only these 247 \nwere approached to attend the last two appointments and, of these, 223 (90%) \ncompleted the third assessment, including 16 people who had taken early retirement \nor who had accepted a remuneration package in return for leaving their jobs. At the \nfinal assessment 196 (85%) of the 231 still employed by the councils were reassessed \nand those who had left council employment were not approached.  Three of those \nstill in work were prescribed beta-blocker drugs between the second and third \nassessments, one for migraine headaches and two for high blood pressure, and their \ndata from subsequent sessions are excluded from the analyses. Data were missing for \nthe mood assessments on a total of 8 occasions, reducing the number of data points \nused for the analyses predicting blood pressure to 940. Data were missing for TC on \n 8\n  \n18 occasions, due to failure to obtain blood for assessment, so that 922 data points \nwere used in the models predicting cholesterol. \nOf the 282 participants, 128 (45 %) were men and 154 (55%) were women; 281 \n(99.6%) were of European origin. The age range was 25 to 59 at the first assessment \nand the mean age was 41.2 \u00b1 8.3 years; 39 (25%) of the women reported being \npostmenopausal at this stage, of whom 23 were taking hormone replacement therapy. \nThere were 57 (20%) smokers. The highest educational achievement reported was no \nformal examinations for 23 (8%) people, GCSEs (age 16 examinations) or equivalent \nfor 86 (31%), A levels (age 18 examinations) or equivalent for 96 (34%), and a \nuniversity degree for 77 (27%).  Most participants (98%) were non-manual workers \nand most (93%) worked full-time. The relatively small group of volunteers who took \npart in the study was unlikely to be a representative sample of the employees of the \ncouncils and this is a limitation of the study.  However, the aim of the study was to \ninvestigate associations between mood and physiological outcomes at the within-\nperson level, and any biases in the sample were unlikely to be systematically related \nto individual differences in such associations.  There were no significant differences \nbetween those who completed all 4 assessments (N=184) and those who failed to \nattend at least one assessment in age, sex, or initial levels of tense arousal, hedonic \ntone, BMI, SBP, DBP or TC. \nStudy design \nThe four assessments were timed as follows: August to September 1995, \nDecember 1995 to January 1996, August to September 1996 and December 1996 to \nJanuary 1997. At each assessment participants were invited to an appointment at \ntheir workplace, during which they completed a questionnaire and were measured. \nMeasurements \n 9\n  \nMood.  Affective state during the week prior to the assessment was measured \nusing the UWIST (University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology) mood \nadjective checklist, as validated by Matthews et al. (1990) for a British population. \nParticipants were asked to describe their average feelings over the last week. Two \nscales were used; tense arousal is designed to assess the degree of negatively \nconnoted arousal, while hedonic tone is a bipolar measure of affect, independent of \nthe degree of arousal.  They are not designed to be independent scales. Tense arousal \nwas assessed by the following items: anxious, jittery, tense, nervous, calm, restful, \nrelaxed and composed, with the last four reverse-scored. Hedonic tone was assessed \nby: cheerful, contented, satisfied, happy, dissatisfied, depressed, sad and sorry, with \nthe last four reverse-scored. The response format was changed slightly to provide \nfive options from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very). The sum of all eight items was used. \nCronbach's alpha was .89 for tense arousal and .88 for hedonic tone at the first \nassessment, indicating good reliability. \nCardiovascular risk factors.  Weight was measured without shoes and heavy \nclothing. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight\/(height2), using self-\nreported height, which may slightly reduce the reliability of this measure. After \nsitting for at least two minutes, two blood pressure measurements were taken two \nminutes apart, from the left arm. An automated oscillometric meter (the UA-701, \nA&D Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan) was used and the average of the two \nmeasurements was calculated. TC level was measured using a compact analyser (the \nAccutrend GC, Boehringer Mannheim, UK), which requires one drop of blood, \nobtained by finger-prick. Measurements were taken throughout the day and are not \nfasting values. The Accutrend GC measures TC in capillary blood using reflectance \nphotometry and has been shown to provide a valid, reliable and practical alternative \n 10\n  \nto laboratory assessments of cholesterol requiring more invasive venipuncture \n(Warnick, 1994; Gottschling, Reuter, Ronquist, Steinmetz & Hattemer, 1995). \nQuality control checks were performed as recommended, at the beginning of each \nday. Participants whose values fell outside the range of the analyser (below 150 \nmg\/dl (6.5% of all measurements) or above 300 mg\/dl (2.4% of all measurements)) \nprovided further drops of blood for analysis using a Home Cholesterol Test \nmanufactured by Boots, UK.  Both types of equipment only allow the testing of TC, \nwhich is a limitation of the study.  \nStatistics \nDevelopments in multilevel mixed-model analyses since the early 1980s have \nmade possible longitudinal within-person analyses evaluating associations between \nchanges over time in independent variables (in this case mood) and changes over \ntime in dependent variables (in this case blood pressure and cholesterol) (Schwartz \nand Stone, 1998; Brondolo et al., 1999).  Heuristically, it is convenient to imagine a \ntime series in which both mood and blood pressure have been assessed many times \nfor a single individual.  We could create a scatterplot with mood (e.g., tense arousal) \non the horizontal axis and SBP on the vertical axis, ignoring the timing of the \nassessments, and fit a regression line to the points.  If a positive association were \nevident, we would then conclude that higher levels of mood are associated with \nhigher SBP for this person or, stated differently, changes in mood are positively \nassociated with changes in SBP.  With separate time series for each of many \nindividuals, often with fewer assessments per individual, we are interested in the \npooled (similar to average) within-person association of mood and SBP, but care \nmust be taken to not confound this estimate with any between-person association of \naverage mood with average SBP.  In mixed models this is handled by correct \n 11\n  \nspecification of random effects and\/or the error structure of the residuals for the \nmodel. \nMixed models also allow the simultaneous estimation of between-person effects, \naddressing average cross-sectional relations such as that of sex with blood pressure \nor cholesterol level.  For this study, we initially estimated a baseline model for each \noutcome variable that included the person-level (between-person) characteristics of \nage and sex and the time-varying (within-person) covariates of BMI and season. Sex \nand season were coded as 0\/1 dummy variables. For SBP, this equation was: \nSBPit = \u03b1 + \u03b21 Agei + \u03b22 Sexi + \u03b31 BMIit + \u03b32 Seasonit + \u03b5it \nTo test the hypothesis that changes in mood would be associated with changes in \nblood pressure (or cholesterol), we next added mood (either tense arousal or hedonic \ntone) to the equation. \nSBPit = \u03b1 + \u03b21 Agei + \u03b22 Sexi + \u03b31 BMIit + \u03b32 Seasonit + \u03b33 Moodit + \u03b5it \nLast, we tested whether the effect of mood differed for males and females by adding \na multiplicative interaction term. \nSBPit = \u03b1 + \u03b21 Agei + \u03b22 Sexi + \u03b31 BMIit + \u03b32 Seasonit + \u03b33 Moodit + \u03b34 Sexi*Moodit + \u03b5it \nWhen an interaction term was significant, an alternative specification of the \npreceding model was used to obtain separate coefficients (and standard errors) for \nthe association between mood and outcome for each sex.1 \nSBPit = \u03b1 + \u03b21 Agei + \u03b22 Sexi + \u03b31 BMIit + \u03b32 Seasonit + \u03b34k Sexi(k)*Moodit + \u03b5it  \nIn each analysis, the \u03b5it are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero \n(for t=1, 2, 3, or 4) and uncorrelated with any of the observed variables; however, the \nvariances are permitted to vary across the four assessments and person i\u2019s residuals \nare allowed\/assumed to be correlated across time with no constraints placed on these \ncorrelations; that is, r(\u03b5it, \u03b5it\u2019) need not be constant for different combinations of t and \n 12\n  \nt\u2019.  This assumption, the same as is typically used in MANOVA analyses of repeated \nmeasures data, subsumes a model in which the intercept, \u03b1, is assumed to vary from \nperson to person and is treated as a random effect.  In so doing, it also ensures that \nthe coefficients of the time-varying covariates (the \u03b3\u2019s) estimate \u201cpure\u201d within-\nperson effects, unconfounded by between-person associations (e.g., average BMI \nacross the four assessments is almost surely associated with blood pressure). As \nsuch, each \u03b3 is an estimate of the predicted change in SBP from one assessment to \nanother associated with someone\u2019s BMI or mood increasing by 1 unit between these \nsame two assessments. PROC Mixed, part of the SAS statistical package (Littell, \nMilliken, Stroup & Wolfinger, 1996), provides estimates and test statistics of \nbetween- and within-person effects for models\/equations of this type.  An advantage \nof this software is that it uses all of the available data; traditional repeated measures \nanalysis of variance software typically excludes an entire subject\u2019s data if he\/she \nfailed to complete any of the assessments. \n \nResults \nMean values of each variable at each assessment are given, separately for men \nand women, in Table 1. We expected that changes in tense arousal and hedonic tone \nwould be correlated (Matthews et al., 1990). Their pooled within-person correlation \nwas -0.73. \nEstimates of the baseline models, showing the relationships of the covariates \nwith blood pressure and TC are shown in Table 2. Age was significantly positively \nassociated with SBP, DBP and TC. Women had significantly lower SBP and DBP \nthan men, but there was no sex difference in TC. Change in BMI was significantly \n 13\n  \nand positively associated with change in SBP, DBP and TC. All three outcomes were \nalso significantly higher in the winter than in the summer. \nThe associations of tense arousal and hedonic tone with blood pressure and TC \nwere tested separately in models that controlled for age, sex, BMI and season (Table \n3). Change in tense arousal was significantly positively associated with changes in \nSBP and DBP, but not in TC. Change in hedonic tone was significantly inversely \nassociated with change in SBP, but not DBP (marginally significant) or TC. To \nillustrate the scale of these associations, we note that since the within-person \nstandard deviation of tense arousal is 6.87, someone whose tense arousal score \nincreased from one standard deviation below her mean to one standard deviation \nabove would be predicted to have her SBP increase by 1.5 mmHg (2*6.87*0.11) and \nher DBP increase by 1.1 mmHg (2*6.87*0.08). \nFor each of the three outcome measures, neither mood variable was statistically \nsignificant after controlling for the other.  Thus, we are unable to conclude that either \nmood dimension is a significantly better predictor than the other of blood pressure or \nTC.  \nTo test whether there were any sex differences in the associations of affective \nstate with blood pressure and TC, the interaction between sex and affective state was \nadded to the models shown in Table 3.  For SBP and TC the interaction effects were \nnon-significant (p>.17 in all cases). For DBP the interaction effect was significant \nfor tense arousal ( t=2.10, p=0.04 ) and approached significance for hedonic tone \n(t=1.84, p=0.07). There was a significant positive association between tense arousal \nand DBP for women (estimate=0.14, t=3.04, p=.002) but not for men (estimate= \n 14\n  \n-0.006, t=0.11, p=.91). Similarly, there was a significant inverse association between \nhedonic tone and DBP for women (estimate=-0.12, t=2.49, p=.01) but not for men \n(estimate=-.01, t=0.20, p=.84). \n \nDiscussion \nOur results show that longitudinal changes in self-reported affective state were \nassociated with changes in blood pressure, but not TC, over a period of 18 months.  \nTo our knowledge, this effect has not previously been reported for blood pressure \nover such an extended time scale. For example, McCann et al. (1999) observed no \nassociation between perceived stress and blood pressure using the same number of \nassessments as this study, over a similar time period, but it is possible that their use \nof a single item measure of affective state, and their analytical technique, which \nincluded averaging results over separate occasions, accounts for the differences in \nour findings. Both McCann et al.'s study and ours were limited by the use of casual \nreadings of blood pressure at each assessment - one in their study, and the average of \ntwo in this study.   \nWe asked participants to report their average feelings over the week prior to \neach assessment and thus suggest that, in addition to responding to momentary \nchanges in mood as assessed by ambulatory studies, blood pressure at any one \nassessment reflects a more general level of affect. However, we cannot exclude the \npossibility that the observed associations reflect only the momentary effect of current \nmood on both reported mood for the previous week and blood pressure (Stone and \nShiffman, 1992). \nWe found that tense arousal and hedonic tone had similar effects, with blood \npressure elevated in association with both types of negative affect assessed by these \n 15\n  \nscales. Thus the hypothesis that only tense arousal would affect either blood pressure \nor cholesterol was rejected.  Our analyses did not indicate an independent effect of \neither mood scale - the significant association of each mood with SBP, when tested \nseparately, is largely attributable to their shared variance. This result suggests either \nthat negative affect, which was assessed by both scales, is the primary affective \ndeterminant of blood pressure variation or, more probably, that the high correlation \nbetween the moods in this study made statistical separation of their effects difficult.  \nThe lack of association between change in mood and change in TC replicates the \nfindings of two earlier studies (Niaura et al., 1991; McCann et al., 1999). Our use of \nnon-fasting measures of total cholesterol only may have influenced our ability to \ndetect effects on lipids.  However, McCann et al's (1990) much smaller study is the \nonly ecological study to have shown a relationship between change in affective state \n(perceived stress) and change in any serum lipid.  Niaura et al. (1992) noted that \nwhere responses of separate subfractions of cholesterol to stressors have been \nobserved they have changed in the same direction. \nChange in BMI was strongly associated with changes in blood pressure \n(consistent with Gerber et al., 1999) and change in TC. We suggest that future \nstudies investigating direct effects of mood on blood pressure and serum lipids \nshould control for changes in BMI. The effect of season was also highly significant, \nwith blood pressure and TC both higher during the mid-winter assessments than \nduring the late-summer assessments. As McCann et al. (1999) have also noted, \nseasonal effects are potentially of great importance for studies involving assessments \nat different times of the calendar year and they should be considered in future \nstudies. \n 16\n  \nWe found no evidence of any sex difference in the relationship between mood \nand either SBP or TC.  However, women showed a stronger relationship between \nmood and DBP than men. Other ecological studies of blood pressure and mood have \nreported no sex difference (Schwartz et al., 1994; Kamarck et al., 1998). Thus, it \nmay be that the smaller blood pressure and lipid responses observed in women in \nresponse to stressors in experimental studies, where affective state has rarely been \nassessed, reflect different affective responses to the same laboratory stressors, \nperhaps because of differential engagement or effort (Pollard, 2001b). More work is \nrequired to clarify discrepancies between laboratory and ecological studies with \nrespect to sex differences in cardiovascular responsivity, and research is also needed \nto identify other factors which may underlie individual differences in cardiovascular \nresponses to mood (Matthews et al., 1992; Schwartz et al., 1994; Feldman et al., \n1999). \nOur results provide new evidence strengthening the suggestion that affective \nstate is likely to have a role in mediating the effects of psychosocial experience on \nblood pressure, and thus perhaps on cardiovascular disease. We suggest that future \nstudies of the effects of exposure to stressors should include assessments of the \nmediating role of mood, as recommended by Stoney et al. (1999), and also that more \nresearch is needed to clarify physiological responses to mood, particularly serum \nlipid responses.  Future studies should make use of the relatively new, more versatile \nstatistical procedures for multilevel modeling. \n \n \n \n \n 17\n  \nFootnote \n \n1 In SAS (version 8.1), the syntax for specifying the first interaction model is: \n Proc mixed noclprint covtest dfbw;  Class subj_id time sex; \n Model DV = age sex bmi season mood sex*mood \/ solution; \n Repeated time \/ type=un sub=subj_id; \nTo obtain estimates of the effect of mood for males and females separately, \ndelete the main effect of mood from the model statement (line 2): \n Model DV = age sex bmi season sex*mood \/ solution; \nNote:  the inclusion of \u2018sex\u2019 in the Class statement is optional for the first \nspecification, but required for the second. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18\n  \nReferences \n \nBrondolo, E., Rosen, R.C., Kostis, J., & Schwartz, J.E.
