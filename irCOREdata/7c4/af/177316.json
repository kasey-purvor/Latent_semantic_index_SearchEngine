Open angle glaucoma is the most\ncommon type of glaucoma. No randomised controlled trials have been conducted evaluating the effectiveness of\nglaucoma screening for reducing sight loss. It is unclear what the most appropriate intervention to be evaluated in\nany glaucoma screening trial would be. The purpose of this study was to develop the clinical components of an\nintervention for evaluation in a glaucoma (open angle) screening trial that would be feasible and acceptable in a\nUK eye-care service.\nMethods: A mixed-methods study, based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex\ninterventions, integrating qualitative (semi-structured interviews with 46 UK eye-care providers, policy makers and\nhealth service commissioners), and quantitative (economic modelling) methods. Interview data were synthesised\nand used to revise the screening interventions compared within an existing economic model.\nResults: The qualitative data indicated broad based support for a glaucoma screening trial to take place in primary\ncare, using ophthalmic trained technical assistants supported by optometry input. The precise location should be\ntailored to local circumstances. There was variability in opinion around the choice of screening test and target\npopulation. Integrating the interview findings with cost-effectiveness criteria reduced 189 potential components to\na two test intervention including either optic nerve photography or screening mode perimetry (a measure of visual\nfield sensitivity) with or without tonometry (a measure of intraocular pressure). It would be more cost-effective, and\nthus acceptable in a policy context, to target screening for open angle glaucoma to those at highest risk but for\nboth practicality and equity arguments the optimal strategy was screening a general population cohort beginning\nat age forty.\nConclusions: Interventions for screening for open angle glaucoma that would be feasible from a service delivery\nperspective were identified. Integration within an economic modelling framework explicitly highlighted the trade-\noff between cost-effectiveness, feasibility and equity. This study exemplifies the MRC recommendation to integrate\nqualitative and quantitative methods in developing complex interventions. The next step in the development\npathway should encompass the views of service users.\nBackground\nComplex interventions are widely used in the health ser-\nvice context but are well known to be difficult to develop\nand evaluate [1]. In the development phase the likely\nmechanism of action for the intervention should be\nunderstood with consideration given to implementation\nat an early stage (by consulting with key stakeholders)\nand to model the potential costs and effects of the pro-\nposed intervention. These factors can then be used to\ninform decisions such as whether a full scale trial would\nbe appropriate or not (e.g. trial would have to be unfeasi-\nbly large; interventions are not likely to be cost-effective).\nThe guidance by Craig and colleagues[1] highlights the\npotential of mixed methodologies to achieve these aims,\nin particular the role of qualitative enquiry to articulate\nthe intervention\u2019s complexity, and the use of quantitative\nCorrespondence: j.m.burr@abdn.ac.uk\nHealth Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZD,\nUK\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2011, 11:54\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/11\/54\n\u00a9 2011 The Glaucoma screening Platform Study group; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

However, there are limited reports of\nhow this augmented approach has been applied in prac-\ntice. This paper presents the first phase of the develop-\nment of a complex intervention for a potential national\nglaucoma screening trial for open angle glaucoma.\nGlaucoma is a leading cause of avoidable blindness\nworldwide [2], and second to macular degeneration is\nthe most common cause of blindness in the UK [3].\nOpen angle glaucoma is the most common form of\nglaucoma [2] and early detection and treatment is effec-\ntive at reducing progressive disease [4,5]. However, the\ncurrent UK practice of opportunistic case finding delays\nidentification of the majority of cases [6] and late detec-\ntion is a major risk factor for glaucoma blindness [7,8].\nThe two main reasons for under detection of glaucoma\nare poor uptake of community eye care services by\nmembers of the public [9-11] or missed cases by pri-\nmary eye care services[12-15]. Based on the public\nhealth importance of glaucoma, it has been considered\nas a condition that might merit a population based\nscreening programme. However, prior to initiating a\nscreening programme several criteria need to be met\nconcerning the condition, the test, the treatment and\nthe screening programme. Importantly any benefits of\nscreening must outweigh potential harms [16].\nThe UK National Screening committee (UKNSC), the\nbody that advises the NHS on screening policy, consid-\nered glaucoma against these criteria in 2006 and con-\ncluded that there was insufficient evidence to\nrecommend glaucoma screening, but that further\nresearch was required [17]. A health technology assess-\nment (HTA) review was commissioned to inform a sub-\nsequent policy review on glaucoma screening. The HTA\nreport [6] identified that no randomised controlled trials\n(RCTs) had been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness\nof glaucoma screening for reducing sight loss [18]. The\neconomic modelling showed that any general population\nscreening programme, based on age selection alone, was\nunlikely to be cost-effective (given current decision-\nmaking criteria in the UK [19]), but that \u2018targeted\u2019\nscreening of high risk groups may be. However, due to\nthe limited primary data available, further research was\nadvocated to test the model estimates and inform deci-\nsions about best practice for screening [20]. A separate\nHTA report, conducted in Finland, concluded that an\norganised screening programme for glaucoma could be\na cost-effective strategy, and, in contrast to the report\nby Burr and colleagues [6,20] that screening was more\nlikely to be cost-effective in older age groups [21]. The\ndifferences in conclusions were driven by differences in\nmodel structure and costs. Specifically, in the Finnish\nmodel the assumed gain in quality of life due to\nscreening preventing inappropriate treatment (and\nhence side effects of treatment) in the elderly was a\nmain driver for the cost-effectiveness of screening.\nPrompted by the continuing uncertainty around\nwhether to progress with a screening programme (and\nby the acknowledged public health importance of glau-\ncoma), the international ophthalmic community has\ncalled for a high quality study evaluating population\nscreening for glaucoma versus the current practice of\nopportunistic case finding [22-25]. Designing a high\nquality RCT of a screening intervention for open angle\nglaucoma presents particular challenges including:\nwhich screening test to use and who should administer\nit; where to locate the screening; which population to\ntarget; how to identify individuals in the target popula-\ntion; how to maximise attendance for screening; and\nhow potential harms and benefits of screening in the\nglaucoma context should be considered.\nThe aim of this study was to inform the development\nof a glaucoma screening intervention that would be fea-\nsible and acceptable both in terms of service delivery\nand cost-effectiveness in a UK health service context.\nWe explored opinions representing a service provider\nand policy perspective, namely eye-care providers, policy\nmakers and health service commissioners, on the most\nfeasible and acceptable components (target population,\nsite, screening tests and operator) of glaucoma screening\nstrategies. These insights provide key information to\nrefine and revise an economic model initially developed\nby Burr and colleagues[6,20].\nMethods\nWe used an integrated qualitative and quantitative\nmethods design. There are many screening tests and\ncombinations of tests, test operators and screening loca-\ntions that could be used in a glaucoma screening pro-\ngramme. Possible screening tests were identified and\nevaluated in a previous systematic review of screening\ntest performance [26]. No single test or combination of\ntests was clearly superior. Selection of an optimal test or\ntest combination therefore rests on the feasibility and\nacceptability to both users and service providers. A Del-\nphi survey, developed from the previous HTA review\nand the review of screening test performance [6,20],\nwith a sample of glaucoma experts worldwide, informed\na reduced set of potential screening tests and testing\narrangements. The findings from the Delphi study are\nbeing written up elsewhere; in brief, there was some\nagreement on the age of fifty to initiate screening in a\nprimary care setting with ophthalmic trained technical\nassistants (hereafter referred as \u2018technicians\u2019) delivering\nthe screening tests; however a wide range of screening\ntests and combinations of tests were selected with no\nagreement on what would be a suitable screening test.\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2011, 11:54\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/11\/54\nPage 2 of 10\nTo determine the feasibility and acceptability of a\nrange of possible tests and testing arrangements in a UK\nNational Health Service context we:\na) undertook semi-structured interviews with eye-\ncare providers, policy makers and health service\ncommissioners to elicit their experiences and per-\nspectives about the main properties of a potential\nintervention for a national glaucoma screening trial;\nand\nb) assessed the likely cost-effectiveness of proposed\ntest strategies.\nDetailed methods are presented below.\nElicitation of provider perspectives on a potential\nscreening intervention\nRecruitment and sampling\nThe purposive sample for this qualitative component\nwas selected to represent a wide range of health profes-\nsionals including ophthalmologists, optometrists, general\npractitioners (GPs), nurses, technicians and directors of\npublic health from across the UK (target numbers,\ntogether with numbers interviewed, are presented in\nTable 1). We liaised with Vision 2020 UK (an umbrella\norganisation focusing on visual impairment and aiming\nto facilitate greater collaboration and co-operation\nbetween organisations within the UK [27]), the relevant\nspecialist royal colleges, the UKNSC, and the National\nDiabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme to facilitate\npurposive recruitment of a wide range of expert groups\nfrom the different organisational sites across the UK.\nWhere possible, we included individuals working in\nurban and rural areas to reflect a broad range of provi-\nsion. The leads of these organisations contacted mem-\nbers by email, providing a brief summary of the project\nand inviting them for interview. From this we received a\nlist of potential participants as follows: 28 ophthalmolo-\ngists, 31 optometrists, 6 GPs, and 12 nurses, whom we\ncontacted by telephone and email to discuss the study\nin more detail, obtain informed consent and to arrange\na suitable interview time. As is common in recruitment\npractice, we also received a small number of participants\nthrough the snowballing method - in particular leading\nto contacts in the \u2018technician\u2019 group (ophthalmic photo-\ngraphers and perimetrists) and with policy makers. In\ntotal we recruited a purposive sample of 46 (Table 1).\nRespondents were given the choice of telephone inter-\nviews or face-to-face interviews (to minimise bias on the\nbasis of geographical accessibility).\nInterviews\nInterviews were conducted by three qualitative research-\ners (AG, DH, SM) and took place between January-\nOctober 2009.

In particular, we explored the reasons for the vary-\ning opinions around the choice of a screening test, and\nthe broader contextual background to interviewees\u2019 opi-\nnions, as a way of identifying external factors that might\nbe anticipated to impact on implementation. The pur-\npose of this was to optimise the design of the\nintervention.\nData handling and analysis\nInterviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and\nanonymised. Field notes were taken during the inter-\nviews and immediately afterwards. We undertook a the-\nmatic qualitative analysis in accordance with constant\ncomparative techniques derived from grounded theory\n[28]. We coded transcripts independently and jointly to\nidentify common themes. Data analysis was a continu-\nous iterative process with categorisation refined to\nreflect new themes and variations on existing themes. A\nthematic framework was developed consisting of six\nhigher order themes, and two subsidiary branches.\nTo present the data in its most accessible form and to\nassist its utilisation in the synthesis with the subsequent\nphase of the project, we presented the data in two parts.\nThe first part presented a systematic summary of opi-\nnions about preferred components of the intervention\nthe screening properties - nominated tests, locations,\ntest operators and diagnostic pathways (illustrated in\nTable 2). The second part presented an interpretative\nanalysis of the broader implementation concerns - nota-\nbly policy, institutional and organisational issues. Hand-\nling the substantial amount of data in this way\nfacilitated the synthesis and integration of data into the\neconomic model. Presenting the data in this way was, of\nnecessity, a simplification of the full accounts; however,\ncare was taken to ensure that the underlying relation-\nships and links in the data were retained.\nEconomic modelling\nOne criterion used to judge whether an intervention\nshould be taken forward to trial is whether it can poten-\ntially be cost-effective. The original economic model,\n[20], compared the cumulative costs and benefits (mea-\nsured in clinical terms and quality adjusted life years) of\ntwo screening interventions with current practice. The\nmodel did not include a detailed specification of the\nscreening tests but, due to the uncertainty regarding the\noptimal screening tests, incorporated the screening test\nperformance of hypothetical tests. The summary data\nproduced by the qualitative interviews provided new\ninformation to define further alternative screening stra-\ntegies which in turn could be compared with current\npractice and tested in the economic model. For example,\nif an interviewee mentioned two potential alternative\nsites where screening could be conducted in a trial plus\ntwo alternative set of tests, four potential alternative\nscreening strategies were thus deemed available for con-\nsideration within the economic model.\nOn the basis of the outputs from this model, the new\nscreening strategies were then ordered according to the\npotential that they would be cost-effective. The ordered\nlist of all possible trial screening strategies was reviewed\nby the multidisciplinary project management group\n(including ophthalmologists, statisticians, health econo-\nmists, health psychologists and sociologists) with a view\nto identifying the most likely candidate strategy to take\nto trial.

In\naddition, the group also considered interventions that\nposed special circumstances e.g. interventions that:\na) could be developed from the non cost-effective\nalternatives that were not already considered in the\ntable. For instance, if an interviewee mentioned a\nvery high skilled operator together with a low cost\nset of tests while another stated a low skilled opera-\ntor together with a very costly set of tests; these\ncould be redeveloped into an alternative that looked\nmore likely to be cost-effective (e.g. non-skilled\noperator together with a low cost set of tests).\nb) were possibly cost-effective but were unrealistic\n(e.g. where a non skilled operator was mentioned\ntogether with a test for which a highly skilled opera-\ntor was needed).\nc) would be useful to consider in terms of their\nacceptability to patients and the public, and included\ntests in an early stage of development but likely to\nbe candidate screening tests for evaluation in further\nresearch.\nThis study was classified as a service evaluation and\ndid not require national research ethics committee\napproval (as advised by the North of Scotland Ethics\nCommittee). We certify that all applicable institutional\nand governmental regulations concerning the ethical use\nof human volunteers were followed during this research.\nResults\nInterviews\nThe findings from the interviews identified many differ-\ning opinions on the choice of screening test (s), consis-\ntent with the prior Delphi study. The qualitative data\nprovided insights into the difficulties agreeing on the\nscreening test(s) and provided insights into how a\nscreening intervention could be tailored according to\nparticular groups who might not access eye care ser-\nvices. Of particular interest, and relevant to the potential\nimplementation of a future screening programme, was\nconcerns about professional tensions between expert\nprovider groups in eye care services, and these concerns\nwere reflected in their respective discussions about the\nfeasibility and acceptability of the component parts (test,\nsite, target population) of the intervention.\nPreferred site\nMost interviewees agreed that screening should take\nplace in a primary care setting. Some thought that capi-\ntalising on current organisation and infrastructure in\nprimary care, either in high street optometry or general\npractice, made most sense, although this was caveated\nby concerns about the business ethos of high street\noptometry, and how this may present a barrier to\nrecruiting high risk groups:\n\u2019That\u2019s (private eye care services) probably going to\ngradually increase in a way because the likes of ...\n[specific company names], all the cheap and nasty\nservices... they model and they tell their optometrists\nthat they are expected to convert 80% of the people\nthey see into a pair of glasses which means there\u2019s no\nwasting time with repeating examinations and doing\nthe things that ... they may wish to do, you know\ntime is money, you are here to flog glasses mate, get\non with it, and that\u2019s very much ... the growing Busi-\nness model\u2019. (Ophthalmologist)\nThe reality of the commercial influences defining high\nstreet optometry featured in optometrists\u2019 responses.\nCurrently there is variation among UK devolved admin-\nistrations as to remuneration procedures for \u2018high street\u2019\n(community) optometrists providing eye care services,\nwith optometrists in Scotland currently receiving con-\nsiderably more than optometrists in other areas of the\nUK:\n\u2019Currently there\u2019s no real incentive for optometrists to\ndo it, so it\u2019s not a pre-requisite to get involved in\nglaucoma management or enhanced screening. \u2019\n(Optometrist, England)\nSome interviewees identified the positive appeal that\nplacing general practitioners as key players in the pro-\ngramme represented. However, it was recognised that\nthis was mitigated in practice by general practitioners\u2019\nretreat from primary eye health, as government policy,\nand indeed the public, has increasingly identified opto-\nmetry as the primary provider site of eye services in the\ncommunity:\n\u201c...so on the one hand there\u2019s this move and I think a\nnumber of patients are getting used to it and accept-\ning it, that when they\u2019ve got an eye problem they go\nto the optician, they don\u2019t come to the GP. And it\nwould kind of seem counterintuitive if then you\u2019ve got\nthis new system aimed at eye conditions which has\ngone back in GP surgeries, do you see what I mean?\u201d\n(Practicing and academic GP)\nThe use of a mobile van was commonly endorsed as\nwas the suggestion that the diabetic retinopathy screen-\ning service could be used as a possible template for\nglaucoma screening or indeed, that glaucoma screening\ncould be piggybacked onto the existing screening for\nretinopathy.\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2011, 11:54\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/11\/54\nPage 5 of 10\nTarget population\nA minority of interviewees highlighted the need for any\nscreening programme to be directed towards the hard-\nto-reach groups, such as African and Caribbean ethnic\ngroups. However, a larger number of the interviewees\ndisagreed with this targeted approach - their own\nexperiences as practitioners left them wondering\nwhether it would be fairer to screen the whole popula-\ntion to ensure that no one with glaucoma was missed\nout. The dilemma that arose, therefore, was that what\nappeared to be the most cost-effective option [the tar-\ngeted approach] was not necessarily the fairest choice,\nin terms of access to services. Below is an example of a\nrespondent calling for a targeted approach to screening:\n\u2019We need to focus particularly our attentions on\npopulations of people from black ethnic minority\ngroups who have a higher susceptibility to certain eye\ndisease and also to people on low incomes, those folk\nare furthest from engagement with the eye care sector\u2019\n(policymaker)\nWhereas another interviewee acknowledged the lim-\nited evidence to make judgements on whom to screen\nillustrating a difference in opinion between policy\nmakers and providers:\n\u2019I think that\u2019s [universal screening at age 50] as good\nas anything because we\u2019ve got very little data about\nwhat will happen if you go out to the community\nscreening glaucoma. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s happen-\ning\u2019 (ophthalmologist)\nPreferred Test(s) and preferred operator\nInterviewees found it difficult to differentiate between\nidentifying test(s) relevant for a screening intervention\n(ie a test to initially identify those more likely to have\nglaucoma) and those for the full diagnosis of glaucoma.\nClinicians generally stressed the necessity of using three\ntests - visual field examination, measurement of intrao-\ncular pressure and imaging of the optic nerve - which\nreflects the practice of a diagnostic strategy used by\nmany of the interviewees. A number also pointed out\nthat the clinical grounds for recognition of glaucoma\nhas undergone a revision, from one based on raised\nintraocular pressure to one that includes optic neuropa-\nthy:\n\u2019\u2019Optometrists... the training has improved and....also\nthe dependence on intraocular pressure has been the\nmain criteria. That has sort of shifted more towards\nvisual fields and optic discs. I say it in that order\nbecause they still aren\u2019t very good at looking at optic\ndiscs. You know, but they do visual fields and they\nattempt to have a look at the optic disc..... and that has\nimproved the detection rate. In time I think it\u2019s\nincreased the number of false positives being referred to\nsecondary care quite dramatically....\"(Ophthalmologist)\nDiscussions about preferred tests highlighted differ-\nences in opinions between the two main clinical provi-\nder groups, ophthalmologists and optometrists. While\nclinician groups generally agreed that optometrists\nshould have a key role in the delivery of tests, the\nmajority indicated that the role of optometrists was to\n\u2018moderate\u2019 between the trained technical operators and\nthe expert ophthalmic diagnostic role.\nOverwhelmingly, and primarily out of financial consid-\neration, clinicians suggested that \u2018technicians\u2019 supported\nby optometrists trained in glaucoma detection, repre-\nsented the optimum choice of test operator. There were\nconcerns raised, however, about ensuring adequate\ntraining for both technicians and optometrists - training\ntogether with quality assurance were identified as\nresource intensive essentials in any future screening\ntrial. Unfortunately it was difficult to explore this in\nmore detail as we had difficulties recruiting \u2018technicians\u2019\nworking in ophthalmic services to the study. Of the\neight technicians we approached to take part only three\nwere willing to be interviewed. However, we did have\ninformal telephone discussions with a small number of\ntechnicians (who declined to formally participate in the\nstudy) who indicated their concerns regarding the lack\nof career structure for technicians, and the already\nintense workload that they experienced for little remu-\nneration in often poor working conditions. This they\nsaw as working against the premise that, in practice,\nthere would be adequate technicians available, and com-\nmitted to, resourcing a massive explosion of their work-\nload should a screening programme be initiated. Their\ninsights echoed those concerns expressed by the for-\nmally recruited technician group of respondents.\nA number of optometrists (especially those who had\ncombined primary and secondary care careers) raised\nconcerns about the structural factors mitigating against\nhigh-street optometrists being able to access courses on\nglaucoma detection, notably that they received no\nappropriate reimbursement for the cost of the courses\nand time out of their commercial enterprises. Addition-\nally, a number pointed to Scotland as the country in the\nUK where the interpretation of the optometrists\u2019 con-\ntract potentially provided more opportunity for specia-\nlising in glaucoma.\nSummary of the results of the interviews\nThe provider and policy perspectives regarding the con-\nfiguration of an intervention for a national glaucoma\nscreening trial indicated support for screening in pri-\nmary care, using \u2018technicians\u2019 supported by optometrists.\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2011, 11:54\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/11\/54\nPage 6 of 10\nPotential barriers to implementation were identified. In\nparticular the interview findings highlighted many of the\ncomplexities around a glaucoma screening programme\nsuch as the ethical issues of adopting a targeted\napproach to those in higher risk groups versus one of\nuniversal population provision, or on strategic and\/or\norganisational grounds (priority setting in the NHS, ade-\nquate resourcing) and the associated constraints of a\ntesting strategy. The study also flagged difficulties in\nbeing able to definitively identify preferred test(s), pre-\nferred operator, location and target population \u2018in prin-\nciple and in isolation\u2019. Rather, the choice of each of\nthese configurations was seen to be dependent on a\nrange of contextual factors. In particular, interviewees\u2019\nopinions were influenced by their experiences of the\ncurrent context of professional and organisational ten-\nsions in eye health services.\nIn summary:\n\u2022 Preferred screening site was a primary care setting\n\u2022 Preferred screening operator was a trained techni-\ncian supported by a specialist optometrist\n\u2022 Most interviewees thought that ultimately an\nophthalmic consultant must make the diagnosis of\nglaucoma\n\u2022 The preferred age to initiative screening was 50\nyears for the general population\n\u2022 Most interviewees identified the \u2018at risk\u2019 groups as\nthose with a primary family history, and those of\nAfrican and Caribbean ethnic origin. Respondents\nindicated that the age at which screening were to be\ninitiated should be under 50 for these risk groups.\n\u2022 Potential intervention should have a low false posi-\ntive rate\n\u2022 Interviewees were aware of the finite resources of\nthe NHS and the limitations this posed on service\ndevelopment, but nonetheless believed that a screen-\ning trial should occur because it could prevent peo-\nple going blind\n\u2022 The commercial culture of high street optometry\nwas seen by many respondents as a barrier to cap-\nturing at risk groups. Current professional tensions\nbetween ophthalmologists and optometrists and\nchanges in the policy and organisational determi-\nnants of eye care services that give optometrists\nincreasing professional autonomy back, influenced\nrespondents\u2019 preferred screening intervention prop-\nerties and their broader discussions.\n\u2022 Many interviewees, while advocating a screening\ntrial, wanted the current infrastructure of case detec-\ntion, referral refinement and shared care to be capi-\ntalised upon.\n\u2022 Most ophthalmologists and optometrists in clinical\npractice were adamant that the screening tests must\nbe based on current best clinical practice and that\nsimplifying this protocol for a screening context was\nnot acceptable practice\nEconomic assessment of likely cost-effectiveness\nAll the potential screening components (i.e. nominated\ntest(s), location(s), test operator(s), target population\nand diagnostic pathway(s)) put forward by the intervie-\nwees were summarised in tabular form for consideration\nin the economic model [20]. A total of 189 screening\nconfigurations were developed from interview data,\nfurther illustrating the difficulty in identifying the clini-\ncal components of a screening intervention. The multi-\ndisciplinary project management group (PMG) agreed\nthere were no additional relevant options that could be\ndeveloped from combination of components mentioned\nby different interviewees (consideration a. - see methods\nsection). From this comprehensive list, a subset was\nimmediately rejected as candidates for a screening inter-\nvention on the basis of known (from the previous\nmodel) lack of cost-effectiveness; 57 because screening\nrequired three or more tests (complex testing) or equip-\nment costing more than \u00a325 per testing based on a\ncost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a320-30,000 per Quality\nAdjusted Life Year gained and 40 on the basis that the\nscreening be undertaken by a highly trained health pro-\nfessional. The original economic modelling evaluation\nsuggested that screening for glaucoma was only likely to\nbe cost-effective if the screening is targeted at forty year\nolds with additional risk factors rather than general\npopulation screening [20]; on this basis, a further 62\nconfigurations which specified screening a general popu-\nlation would have been ruled out. However, it was\napparent from the qualitative interviews that an equity\nargument was voiced in favour of general population\nscreening and considerations should be given to screen-\ning in remote rural locations. Both cost-effectiveness\nand equity arguments are likely to be important to deci-\nsion-makers and taking into account the findings from\nthe economic model and the interviews the PMG agreed\nthat the 30 remaining configurations were realistic (con-\nsideration b. - see methods section). Seven of the\nremaining configurations considered a mobile unit as\nthe setting where screening would be conducted. We\nconsidered this a variation of a primary care setting par-\nticularly relevant for remote areas. Key features of the\nremaining 23 configurations were variations on screen-\ning location including \u2018high street\u2019 optometry or in gen-\neral medical practice. The tests were optic nerve\nphotography or perimetry (a measure of visual field sen-\nsitivity) with or without tonometry (a device to measure\nintraocular pressure), operated by paramedical staff (e.g.\nnurse, technician or self-assessment, the latter being\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2011, 11:54\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/11\/54\nPage 7 of 10\npossible for perimetry available on Personal Computers\nand self assessment tonometers.\nIntegrating the findings from the qualitative interviews\nwith the modelling thus identified the components of\nthe screening test intervention that could be implemen-\nted in a trial from a service perspective. These are gen-\neral population screening, for a cohort at age forty\n(based on findings of the qualitative interviews of the\nneed to balance feasibility and equity with cost-effective-\nness criteria) in a primary health care setting. Screening\nwould be conducted by ophthalmic trained technical\nassistants, undertaking optic nerve photography or\nscreening mode perimetry (a measure of visual field sen-\nsitivity) with or without tonometry. The precise location\nof screening a community setting would need to be tai-\nlored to local circumstances illustrated by the suggestion\nof using widely available eye care services e.g. the \u2018high\nstreet\u2019 optometrist or mobile units for remote areas.\nDiscussion\nThis study identified screening interventions that eye care\nservice providers, policy makers and health service com-\nmissioners would find feasible and acceptable to use in a\ntrial of glaucoma screening and for implementation into\npractice if screening was effective. The economic model-\nling component of this study ruled out candidate tests that\nwould be highly resource intensive and provided a short\nlist of candidate strategies that had the greatest potential\nto be cost-effective. These involved testing in a primary\ncare setting (because they are embedded in the community\nand have the infrastructure in place) delivered by techni-\ncally trained personnel using a simple testing strategy - a\nmeasure of intraocular pressure (a known risk factor for\nglaucoma) [29], and either a measure of the visual field or\nphotography of the optic nerve.\nThe screening configurations identified in this study\nmeet one of the key principles of screening - that a sim-\nple, safe and affordable test is required before a screen-\ning programme can be implemented [30,16]. There is\ntension, however, when determining the most appropri-\nate screening test, between a public health and a clinical\nperspective. The public health perspective requires that\na screening test be sufficiently precise to distinguish\nthose who probably do and do not have the disease at\nan acceptable cost, whereas the clinical view point often\ntends towards the desire for precision and reliability.\nThere are many sophisticated imaging tests for diagnos-\ning glaucoma, but these are not affordable for a public\nhealth intervention. Similarly, there are a variety of tech-\nnologies to evaluate the peripheral visual fields. From\nthe currently available tests, fundus photography or sim-\nple visual field testing combined with a measure of\nintraocular pressure meet the economic criteria. More\nprecise technologies or examinations would then be\nrequired to examine those who screen positive. Cur-\nrently, the recognition of glaucoma on fundus photogra-\nphy is a skilled task and would require manual grading\nby experienced observers. Automated grading systems\nfor retinal images have been developed for diabetic reti-\nnopathy screening [31], and have been shown to be less\ncostly and as effective as manual grading [32]. Similarly,\nthere is potential for the development of automated sys-\ntems for glaucoma recognition from retinal photographs\n[33]. The performance of photography, with and without\nautomated grading, compared with simple visual field\ntesting would need to be compared within the interven-\ntion arm in a future glaucoma screening trial or in a\nparallel companion study. Screening tests suitable for\nself-assessment are in the early stages of development,\nand should be considered as an option when the tech-\nnologies have advanced sufficiently.\nThis study is one of the first to show the formal inte-\ngration of qualitative and quantitative methodologies (as\npromoted in the MRC guidance) in the development of\na complex intervention and specifically the use of a qua-\nlitative enquiry to restructure the care pathways of an\neconomic model. The qualitative exploration enabled\nagreement to emerge for some aspects of the proposed\nintervention, whilst allowing reasons for disagreement to\nbe explored in-depth. The detailed information that\nunderpinned the lack of consensus (e.g. the disagree-\nments between the professional groupings) informs the\nimplementation planning for any of the proposed inter-\nventions, and aided interpretation of the results of the\neconomic analysis in particular highlighting that a more\nuniversal coverage of screening all individuals above a\ncertain minimum age would represent a more appropri-\nate balance between equality of access and cost-effec-\ntiveness. The economic modelling facilitated the\nreduction of a wide selection of suggested interventions\nto a shortlist representing those most likely to be cost-\neffective. The study also brought together the perspec-\ntives of a wide range of stakeholders (including ophthal-\nmologists, optometrists, GPs, nurses, technicians and\npolicy makers) who would all have input into a screen-\ning programme for glaucoma, and this breadth of per-\nspective adds to the veracity of our findings. Also, while\nprevious attempts to provide high quality evidence for\nthe case of screening for glaucoma have concentrated\non the technical and technological aspects of design,\nevaluation and assessment, our research has also consid-\nered the implications of a screening programme on the\ncomplex organisational context in which the manage-\nment of glaucoma exists.\nWhilst our project was successful in facilitating the\ndevelopment of an intervention for future testing in a\ntrial of glaucoma screening, it did have a number of lim-\nitations. In particular, recruitment proved more difficult\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2011, 11:54\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/11\/54\nPage 8 of 10\nin practice than had been hoped. Whilst ophthalmolo-\ngists and optometrists were easier to recruit, nurses,\ntechnicians and general practitioners were more diffi-\ncult. In the case of nurses and technicians, the difficulty\nappeared to be related to confidence in speaking as one\nwho is located relatively low in the clinical \u2018hierarchy\u2019,\nwhilst difficulties in recruiting general practitioners\u2019 in\nresearch is well recognised [34]. Additionally, despite\nthe use of telephone interviews, we were unable to\nrecruit as many respondents with practice experience of\nisolated and rural locations.\nThe MRC revised guidance outlines well the appropri-\nate steps for the development of a complex intervention\n[1]. Integral to its tenets is the recommendation for the\nsynthesis of qualitative and quantitative methods, as well\nas the need to consider implementation issues through\nparticipants\u2019 accounts of their perspectives and experi-\nences. The integration process, however, required signif-\nicant iteration between the disciplinary approaches to\nensure that the qualitative data could be synthesised\ninto an economic model. The specification of particular\nscreening interventions was a challenge for the qualita-\ntive researchers because this was not a standard way of\ninterpreting the data produced. Nevertheless, two com-\nplementary mechanisms to synthesising the qualitative\ndata were used - firstly to systematically sort and\ndescribe the respondents\u2019 opinions about preferred com-\nponents of the intervention (to allow direct usage in the\neconomic model) and secondly to use the richness of\nthe data provided by the qualitative data to undertake\nan interpretative analysis of the results of the economic\nmodel and around the implementation considerations in\nwhich the preferences were nested. The importance of\ninterplay between disciplines in mixed methods research\nhas been emphasised in the literature, particularly by\nO\u2019Cathain and colleagues [35].\nWe have identified screening strategies that are accep-\ntable in a service provider and policy context, but they\nmay not be acceptable to health care users. Additional\nresearch is required to elicit the beliefs of health service\nusers regarding the acceptability of these screening\ninterventions and their current use of eye care services\nto identify the most likely behaviour change interven-\ntions for maximising attendance for glaucoma testing.\nThese findings will provide additional information, in\nterms of potential uptake of any screening interventions\nand current uptake of current eye care services, to be\nintegrated into the economic model to inform the feasi-\nbility of any future glaucoma screening trial. This\nresearch is underway.\nConclusions\nThis paper has highlighted how mixed methods research\ncan inform the development of an intervention for\nscreening for open angle glaucoma. It allowed the iden-\ntification of screening interventions that could be imple-\nmented in a UK health service context. Integration\nwithin an economic modelling framework explicitly\nhighlighted the trade-off between cost-effectiveness, fea-\nsibility and equity. The next step in the intervention\ndevelopment is to seek the views of service users.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank all those who participated in the interview process.\nThis paper was developed from the first phase of a project funded by the\nMedical Research Council (project reference G0701759) Developing the\nintervention & outcome components of a proposed randomised controlled\ntrial of screening for open angle glaucoma.
