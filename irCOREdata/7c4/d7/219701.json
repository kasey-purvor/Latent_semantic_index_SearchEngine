Does it represent an ambitious \nnew theoretical framework for interdisciplinary understanding of the development of \nhuman behaviour, cultural practices and social institutions? Does the natural \nselection paradigm, in Campbell\u2019s (1974:420) words, provide \u2018the universal non-\nteleological explanation of teleological achievements\u2019? Is Darwinism \u2018the only \nadequate general causal theory of evolutionary change in complex systems with \nvaried entities\u2019, as Hodgson argues below? Or can it contribute at a less exalted level \nby generating fruitful hypotheses and insights concerning the adaptation of \nbehaviours, practices, artefacts and institutions to the ever-changing encompassing \nnatural and social environment? Here evolutionary reasoning would serve as a useful \ntool of thought. Or is the whole enterprise a return to fruitless grand narratives, \nindeed the grandest of all narratives, doomed to failure, as post-modernists would \ncontend? \n \nTo discuss these issues the Academy joined with the ESRC to promote this seminar, \nhosted at the University of Bath by the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Glynis Breakwell. It was \naddressed by four eminent scholars, three with a commitment to apply evolutionary \nthinking to social entities and practices, and one who engages critically with the \nparadigm.  \n \nProf Garry Runciman contributed, as President of the British Academy, to an earlier \nseminar on the evolution of cultural entities, the book of which provides a convenient \ntour of many central issues (Runciman 2002, Wheeler et al 2002). In the second \nvolume of his Treatise on Social Theory (1989) he proposes a reformulation of \nevolutionary sociology and develops an audacious empirical account of the evolution \nof human practices. Professor Ruth Mace works at the Centre for the Evolution of \nCultural Diversity at University College, London and is the author of The Evolution of \nCultural Diversity: A Phylogenetic Approach (2005). Professor Geoffrey Hodgson is \nan economist with a long-time interest in evolutionary thinking, his contributions \nranging from Economics and Evolution (1993) to Economics in the Shadow of Darwin \nand Marx (2006). Prof Michael Rustin\u2019s academic interests bridge sociology and \npsychoanalysis and many more topics besides. Since reviewing Runciman\u2019s book \n(Rustin 1999) he has retained a critical engagement with the evolution debate.   \n \nRunciman upholds a strict interpretation of Darwinian theory in terms of heritable \nvariation and competitive selection. He draws a distinction between the application of \nnatural selection to understanding human behaviour (the realm of evolutionary \npsychologists and others) and the application of heritable variation and competitive \nselection to understanding socio-cultural evolution. However, within this latter \ncategory he makes a further distinction between cultural selection, through such \nmechanisms as imitation and learning, and social selection where institutions, rules \nand roles are selected. A comprehensive understanding of human warfare requires \nthe contribution of all three evolutionary frameworks, he claims. \n \nMace illustrates from her research the complex interaction of the first two of \nRunciman\u2019s fields of evolutionary explanation. Cultural selection helps understand \nthe limits of males\u2019 supposedly universal genetic preferences for women of a \nparticular shape. A universal search for partners with good health can take culturally \nvariable forms. Similarly, life history evolution in conjunction with human genetics, \n 3 \nhelps understand the early onset of the menopause and the role of grandmothers in \nchild care. Distinguishing between proximate and ultimate explanations, she regards \nthe evolutionary paradigm as a fertile source of hypotheses regarding the latter.  \n \nHodgson is concerned with the third of Runciman\u2019s selection systems \u2013 the social \nselection of the practices and structures of firms and business organisation, as part \nof the relatively new field of evolutionary economics. This entails researching the \nsources of variation in these (including human inventiveness), the modes of \ninheritance (including deliberate learning) and the selection mechanisms, notably \nincluding markets of various kinds. He concludes that this Darwinian three-stage \nprocess supplies the most general framework for understanding the evolution of \nfirms, but that it always requires supplementing with auxiliary explanations. \n \nRustin accepts the relevance of all three fields of evolutionary explanation to certain \nfeatures of human behaviour, but rejects it as a general explanation. He argues a \nconnection between genetic factors and attachment theories concerning human \ninfants and Kleinian theories of potential conflicts between mothers and infants. He \nalso recognises the contribution of social selection mechanisms to understanding \nsuccess and failure in producer markets, scientific ideas and innovations in art forms; \nbut rules Darwinism out as a method for explaining states and the strategies of \npower-holders. \n \nThus these presentations reveal the great diversity of the field. As Mace stresses \nthere is a wide variety of concepts, frameworks and empirical studies which come \nunder the general evolutionary heading. Nonetheless, we can identify five features of \nthe framework on which all agree. First, Darwinism entails processes of variation, \ninheritance and selection which can be applied to socio-cultural entities. Second, it \nprovides an analysis of changes at the level of populations: individual intentions \n\u2018retreat into the background\u2019, though the role of individual inventiveness and creativity \nis recognised. Third, it is a resolutely non-teleological theory, with the implication that \nlarge-scale social reforms will always encounter unintended consequences. Fourth, it \nprovides a fertile source of hypotheses to explain socio-cultural variations and \ncommonalities. Fifth, it always encourages, and frequently requires, inter-disciplinary \nresearch \u2013 or indeed, non-disciplinary research (Bowles 2003). The Darwinian \nevolutionary paradigm promises a new route to breaking down the stranglehold of \nentrenched academic disciplines \u2013 and thus potentially contributes to the aims of the \nAcademy of Social Sciences.  \n \n \n \n \nDarwinian explanations of socio-cultural evolution \n \nGarry Runciman \n \nI feel bound to begin by voicing my surprise that the question which this \nmeeting has been invited to address should be \u2018whether the theory of natural \nselection has anything to offer present-day studies of culture and society\u2019, rather than \n\u2018how much?\u2019.  Even social scientists less favourably disposed than the present \nspeakers to a neo-Darwinian approach to the study of human behaviour are bound to \nacknowledge that a Kuhnian paradigm-shift has been under way for the past 20 \nyears or more, extending all the way from psychology to archaeology and including \nnot least evolutionary game theory, whose extensive literature should be more widely \nknown than it is among social scientists other than economists.  The central idea is \n 4 \nwhat Darwin himself called \u2018descent with modification\u2019, but is nowadays better put as \n\u2018heritable variation and competitive selection\u2019.  To the question \u2018variation and \nselection of what?\u2019, the short general answer is \u2018information affecting behaviour in the \nphenotype\u2019.  In the theory of natural selection, the information is transmitted \nbiologically from organism to organism by strings of DNA which encode the \ninstructions for making protein molecules.  But as the American psychologist Donald \nT. Campbell was perhaps the first to grasp fully, the theory of natural selection is only \none special case of a more general evolutionary theory which covers not only the \nevolution of plant and animal species and the evolution of the chemical elements \nwhich preceded it but the evolution of human cultures and societies which is \ncontinuous with it. \nI am myself a sociologist, and I have often wondered why it is that so many of \nmy fellow-sociologists are among those whom Kuhn, in his well-known book of 1963, \ncalls the \u2018die-hards\u2019 \u2013 those, that is, who simply refuse to acknowledge the paradigm \nwhich is displacing the one in which they were brought up and which they continue to \nteach their students.  There are, I think, two main reasons.  The first is that they \nassociate the current neo-Darwinian approach to the study of behaviour witih the \nlong outdated and thoroughly discredited \u2018Social Darwinism\u2019 of the late-19th and \nearly-20th century.  The second is that they are afraid that if they sign up to the neo-\nDarwinian approach they will be committing themselves to a research programme \nwhich will reduce sociology to applied biology \u2013 a fear which, although unfounded, is \nin part a reaction against some of the more exaggerated claims made on behalf of \n\u2018sociobiology\u2019, so called, during the 1970s and 1980s.  I do not know how long this \nstate of affairs will continue.  It may be that, as Kuhn explicitly envisaged, the die-\nhards have literally to die off and be succeeded by a new generation which has by \nthen consigned them to the history-books.  But for the moment, there are some within \nthe social-scientific community who take a neo-Darwinian approach as a matter of \ncourse at the same time that there are others who seem unable (or perhaps \nunwilling) to understand what neo-Darwinian theory actually says. \nIt is important, however, to draw a clear distinction between the contribution \nwhich the theory of natural selection itself can make to the explanation of human \nbehaviour and the extent to which it provides a model for theories of cultural and \nsocial selection which have both significant analogies and significant disanalogies \nwith it.  There are on the one side the behavioural ecologists (as the sociobiologists \nnow call themselves), the behaviour geneticists (who study innate within-group \ndifferences), the evolutionary psychologists (who study the naturally selected \nfeatures of the human brain which influence behaviour cross-culturally), the \ndevelopmental and cognitive psychologists (who are concerned with the interaction \nbetween innate predispositions and the environment), and the brain scientists (who \nare increasingly able to explain at the molecular level differences identified by the \nbehaviour geneticists at population level).  On the other side are the theorists of \ncultural and social selection who do not accept that the collective human behaviour-\npatterns which they study are explicable, except to a limited degree, by direct \nreference to the theory of natural selection, but who seek to explain them by \nreference to other mechanisms of heritable variation and competitive selection of \ninformation affecting phenotypic behaviour.  Ironically, it is from the theory of natural \nselection itself that there has come the conclusive refutation of the racist sociology \nwhich the Social Darwinists claimed to have derived from it.  But the neo-Darwinians \nhave been slow to recognize that \u2018sociocultural\u2019 evolution \u2013 the term used by Donald \nCampbell and many others \u2013 needs to be split in two and analyzed at the separate \nlevels of the cultural and the social. \nAt the cultural level, the heritably variable and competitively selected \ninformation affecting behaviour is transmitted from mind to mind by imitation and \nlearning: the members of difference human populations acquire and transmit to their \nchildren, pupils, and peer-groups (and sometimes, in reverse, to their parents and \n 5 \nteachers) the beliefs and attitudes which distinguish one culture or sub-culture from \nanother.  But something else goes on when it comes to behaviour at the social level \n\u2013 the level, that is, of class conflict, slavery, government, bureaucracy, law-courts, \nand so forth where people behave as they do because of information encoded in \nrule-governed practices which define the institutional roles which they occupy and \nperform.  If, for example, you are a soldier conscripted into the army of the state of \nwhich you are a citizen, your behaviour is governed by sanctions which your \nsuperiors can bring to bear whatever the genes you have inherited and whatever the \nbeliefs and attitudes you are carrying around inside your head.  You may, of course, \nrefuse to accept the rules and follow the practices which define your role even is the \nsanction is imprisonment or death.  But those rules and practices are the outcome of \na history of heritable variation and competitive selection which have made them what \nthey are independently of any individual decision or action of yours.  Only at rare \ntimes of constitutional choice are we \u2013 or some of us \u2013 in a position to design the \nroles which make the society of which we are members the kind of society that it is. \nIf there is any single feature of the neo-Darwinian paradigm which \ncategorically differentiates it from those which were on offer to sociologists when I \nwas a graduate student, it is its repudiation of teleology in any form.  Evolution \ninvolves by definition a change out of one state of the world into a new and different \none.  But it is not a change along a trajectory leading to a predetermined destination.  \nIn this, it parts company not only with Marxist theory and its presupposition of a \ndialectical process emerging out of contradictions between the forces and social \nrelations of production, but also with Weberian theory and its presupposition of an \ninexorable process of what Weber called rationalization.  It is true that Weber \ndisagreed categorically with Marx in that he saw social evolution as driven by \nautonomous ideological and political forces interacting with, but not reducible to, \neconomic forces.  But Weber, although he more than once discussed the concept of \nselection, rejected it on the mistaken grounds that it implies a circular definition of \ncompetitive success.  It does not, for reasons fully accommodated within neo-\nDarwinian theory.  But neo-Darwinian theory also rules out neo-Weberian theories of \n\u2018modernization\u2019 in which the story of social evolution is a story of the predetermined \ntriumph of ideas and institutions originating in the so-called \u2018West\u2019.  \u2018Success\u2019, \nwhether of a distinctive species, culture, or society, means no more (but no less) than \nthat the continuous process of heritable variation and competitive selection cuases \nsome of them to go extinct while others persist and generate new forms in a \ncontinuous, path-dependent but open-ended sequence. \nBehind all this, there still lurks the deeper question why the world should work \nthe way that Darwinian theory says that it does.  Some, like Archbishop Temple of \nCanterbury and former President Bill Clinton, say that it is because God chose to \ndesign the world to work this way.  But if so, those of us who are trying to explain \nwhat goes on in it have to find non-teleological explanations at the biological, cultural, \nand social levels alike.  We cannot fall back on ad hoc appeals to what Darwin\u2019s \nopponents called \u2018special provision\u2019 without closing our eyes to the results of a \ncentury of scientific discovery confirming that Darwin got it right. \nLet me take as an example of the three levels of selection the sociology of \nwarfare.  If we think of the proverbial anthropologist from Mars who comes to study \nthe behaviour of the human beings who inhabit Planet Earth, that person will not fail \nto notice the extent to which young adult males periodically confront each other in \nsystematically organized combat between groups armed with lethal weapons.  That \nlethal violence is something which is far more often done by young adult males than \nby either older males or coeval females is one of the best-attested cross-cultural \nfindings of recent decades.  But we also know that some peoples documented in the \nanthropological and historical record are much less warlike than others, even when \nthere is no significant difference in either their genetic make-up or their ecological \nenvironment.  Although courage in battle is generally admired, victories celebrated, \n 6 \nand rituals performed in commemoration of the fallen, culture \u2013 i.e. information \ntransmitted by imitation and learning \u2013 exercises an unmistakable influence on the \nreadiness of different human populations to go to war and the manner in which, and \nmethods by which, they do so.  But there is more to it than that.  We also know that \nthe men (and occasional women) who do the killing do so to very different degrees of \neffectiveness and from within very different systems of social organization.  This is a \nmatter not of individual psychology but of the information encoded in the rules which \ngovern the way in which soldiers are trained, deployed, and disciplined.  It is not just \nthat some individuals are more pugnacious than others and some cultures more \nbellicose than others, but that some societies are more successful than others in \nwaging war because of institutional differences between them.  Sociologists of \nwarfare who are interested in comparing different human populations down the ages \nand across the globe are studying patterns of collective behaviour which are the \noutcome of a process of biological and cultural and social evolution in which the \nmechanisms of variation and selection are very different at each of the three levels. \nThe final point I should like to make is that theories of natural, cultural, and \nsocial selection alike all operate at the level of populations and not of individuals.  \nThey explain why distinctive patterns of behaviour emerge and persist in the \naggregate, on average, and over time.  It is not a question of denying the reality of \nthe individual differences between members of the same species, or culture, or \nsociety, or of the separate decisions and choices which they make: Darwin himself \nwas explicit that, as he put it in The Descent of Man (1883:66), \u2018instinctive actions \u2026 \nmay be replaced by others pursued with the aid of the free will\u2019.  But in the evolution \nof species, cultures, and societies as such, the individuals recede, so to speak, from \nview.  They are seen as the carriers of the heritably variable and competitively \nselected bundles of genetic, cultural, and social information which determine their \ncollective behaviour-patterns in their different local environments.  That does not \nmake us into helpless automata.  Our genetic inheritance does not predetermine our \nindividual development in interaction with our environment; our cultural inheritance \ndoes not prevent us from modifying and reinterpreting the beliefs and attitudes \ntransmitted to us by parents and mentors; our social inheritance leaves us with ample \nscope to renegotiate the practices which define the roles which we occupy and \nperform.  That is what Darwin\u2019s \u2018descent with modification\u2019 is all about.  But it is the \nheritable variation and competitive selection of biologically and culturally and socially \ntransmitted information which has made our human world what it is. \n \n \n \nThe evolution of cultural diversity \nRuth Mace \nI want to give a brief overview of evolutionary approaches to human behaviour.  The \nfield is actually very diverse; there are several different kinds of questions and each \ncan be answered at different levels. I will try to give a whistle-stop tour of some \nexamples of these kinds of studies because I do not want you to think there is only \none way of studying the evolution of human behaviour.  It is a very complex field.   \n \nProximate and Ultimate Explanations \nI distinguish at the beginning between proximate and ultimate evolutionary \nexplanations.  When asked \u2018Is this something caused by this or caused by that?\u2019, \nthere are different ways of answering.  Proximately, one can answer it with respect to \nmechanisms, hormones, mental modules in the brain, development, or the whole \n 7 \nnature-nurture debate.  These are the \u2018how\u2019 questions \u2013 the proximate questions \u2013 \nabout what leads someone to behave in a particular way. Then there are the ultimate \nquestions, which could include the evolutionary history that led up to that point or it \ncould include the adaptive function.  In other words, what selective pressures, what \nevolutionary pressures led that behaviour to be selected?   \n \nThese questions are not mutually exclusive. In many of the arguments between \nsocial scientists and natural scientists, someone is putting forward a proximate \nexplanation, someone is putting forward an ultimate explanation, and they could both \nbe right or wrong. To give an example of a question I am interested in: Why do \npeople in modernising societies have so few children?  Proximately, we have \nacquired ideas and values that cause us to allocate our resources to other things.  \nUltimately, it is possibly because people with these ideas have had more influence at \ntransmitting these ideas.  quantity-quality trade-off and it is only children who are \nheavily invested in that are successful in a highly competitive world.  We want our \nchildren to succeed so we are investing heavily in each of them and having very few.  \nRight from the start, there is more than one possible explanation or more than one \nway of asking that question. \n \nThree schools of thought \nI want to briefly outline three main schools of thought within the contemporary \nevolutionary paradigm.   \n\uf0a7 Evolutionary psychology \n\uf0a7 Gene-culture co-evolutionary theory, sometimes referred to as cultural evolution \n\u2013 I also have interests here. \n\uf0a7 Human behavioural ecology or evolutionary ecology \u2013 the camp I most strongly \naffiliate with \n \nAccording to evolutionary ecology, natural selection is efficient.  It works on \nphenotypic strategies including behaviours, which are optimal to a species\u2019 niche. By \ncontrast evolutionary psychologists are more interested in the brain as an organ \nselected by natural selection.  Cultural evolutionists are interested in ideas, memes, \ncultural variance, whatever you want to call them, which are transmitted in different \nways from genes.  Thus the schools tend to study different kinds of things.  \nEvolutionary ecologists are trying to work out the fitness consequences of behaviour \nwhereas evolutionary psychologists are more interested in mental modules and \npsychological adaptations. Cultural evolutionists have not, on the whole, done much \nempirical work, but when they do they are interested in changes in the frequencies of \nideas.   \n \nOne area where the three schools of thought differ is in their approach to studying \nmal-adaptation.  Evolutionary ecology is basically an adaptationist paradigm, \nassuming that natural selection on cultural variation is efficient.  Evolutionary \npsychologists assume it is not very efficient because they say we evolved as hunter \ngatherers and utilise the concept of the EEA, the environmental of evolutionary \nadaptiveness.  It is as though we have a hunter gatherer brain on our shoulders and, \ntherefore, do not necessarily behave in an adaptive way in a modern environment.  \nThe third group of cultural evolutionists are also interested in mal-adaptation because \nmemes can be transmitted in a non-Mendelian way very different from genes. \nTherefore, one can get different outcomes when studying cultural evolution from \npurely genetically determined behaviour.   \n \n 8 \nEvolutionary psychology and human universals \nEvolutionary psychologists tend to be interested in human universals, for example in \nexplaining mate choice or sex differences.  Despite their emphasis on the EEA, they \ndo not normally study hunter-gatherers.  Rather ironically they are much more likely \nto be doing lab experiments on undergraduates, although, as I will show, these kinds \nof studies are now broadening out into much wider populations and getting very \ndifferent results. \n \nOne supposedly classic human universal studied by evolutionary psychologists is the \nattractiveness to men of women with different body shapes. When presented with \npictures of women with different waist-hip ratios, most men say they find the women \nwith 0.7 WHR more attractive than the women with 0.9 WHR.  Studies across \nuniversities all over the world have yielded very similar results so the conclusion was \ndrawn that this was a human universal. However, we do not know what men in EEA \nwanted.  We do not have much art from that period, but what we do have does not \nnecessarily suggest that thin women were greatly valued then. \n \nIn fact when asked, few hunter gatherer populations there are left in the world cared \nabout the waist-hip ratio.  They regarded the fattest women on the sheet as the most \nattractive, completely at odds with Western populations.  Another rather interesting \nexperiment in the Amazon studied four different populations: A was far away from \ncontact with Western media, living in the remote forest; two were further down the \nriver with C being on the coast and D being American university students. The more \nremote populations preferred the fatter women and the university students preferred \nthe thinnest women, and the ones in-between preferred the ones in-between.   \n \nA similar experiment of preferred BMI (body mass index) found the preferred BMI in \nUK populations peak at around 20, which is pretty thin, but very thin women were not \nreally preferred and fatter women were also not particularly preferred.  However in a \nZulu population in South Africa, there was a dislike for thin women but being fat was \nnot considered a disadvantage at all \u2013 similar to the Amazonian results. However, the \npreferences of South Africa Zulus who had migrated to Britain started to change \ntowards the UK preference.  Finally the children of South African parents of Zulu \norigin born in Britain expressed preferences almost indistinguishable from the native \nBritish population (Tovee et al 2006).   \n \nSo the idea that these preferences are human universals has really gone out of the \nwindow.  Evolutionary psychology is now having to engage with the idea of cultural \nevolution, and the findings of huge cultural variation. Perhaps the underlying principle \nis that people look for partners with good health but the definition of good health is \nculturally variable.  That is a question, I think, that remains to be answered. \n \nDual Inheritance \nThe second school of thought, gene-culture co-evolutionary theory, develops dual \ninheritance models of genetic and cultural inheritance and explores how this can lead \nto different patterns from simple genetic evolution (Boyd & Richerson 1985).  It tends \nto be very mathematical area of study because it is very difficult to test these things \nempirically. To give one example, this school is interested in how different \nnon-Mendelian routes of transmission affect cultural behaviour.  For example, if it is \nMendelian, genes are inherited from parents and no one else.  With cultural variation, \nthere is what Boyd and Richerson called biased transmission.  People can choose \ntheir cultural models, prestigious people for example. Imagine we have an innate \ndisposition to copy teachers, rock stars, and people who have prestige.  Maybe \npeople vary in success at attaining influential roles and this variation is affected by \ntheir beliefs.  Cultural variants that lead to success in attaining influential roles will \n 9 \ntend to spread.  Perhaps this explains things like famous climbers taking horrendous \nrisks or, going back to the waist-hip ratios, supermodels getting dangerously thin.  \nThese kinds of models can take us to things which look, on the face of it, clearly \nmal-adaptive from a classic genetic Darwinian perspective.  \n   \nOne critical difference is that it is possible to get a form of group selection to work in \na way that you cannot in genetic evolution.  Genetic selection does not work at the \nlevel of the group, but at the level of the individual or the gene. This is because even \nonly a small amount of migration between groups (a necessary condition of being the \nsame species) destroys the genetic integrity of groups and makes it hard to maintain \nvariation between groups. However in cultural traits, forces such as \u2018conformist bias\u2019 \nand \u2018altruistic punishment\u2019 can enforce group level differences ( as individuals are \nforced\/induced to change their cultural make-up in a way that they cannot do with \ntheir genetic make-up); this enables some form of cultural group selection to favour \nbehaviours that favour co-ordinated or co-operative groups as they can out-compete \nother groups.  It has been suggested such forces might underpin a diverse range of \ncomplex human social traits, from warfare to religion.  However the emprical work \nnecessary to support or reject these models is still only in its infancy. \n \nEvolutionary ecology and life history evolution \nThis third school of thought, with which I am most closely associated, tends to study  \nnatural fertility populations, including subsistence strategies, reproductive strategies, \nparental investment and life history theory.  It is often done by anthropologists such \nas myself working in more traditional populations, although is again now expanding \nits area of study to include modrenising and urban societies.  I will give two examples \nfrom life history evolution approaches. \n \nThe Grandmother Hypothesis \nCompared with our nearest relatives, the other great apes, the human life history \ndiffers in many ways.  We have a long period of time before we reproduce but once \nwe start reproducing we actually do so at a rapid rate and then females stop \nreproducing long before they die.  Compared to other animals, the reproductive part \nof the female life history has been squashed into the middle of the lifespan with long \nnon-reproductive periods both before and after.  Human females have births about \nevery three years in natural fertility populations compared the Orang-utan, with not \ndissimilar body weight (and normally birth rates scale quite well with body weight), \nwhich have offspring every eight years.  Gibbons, which are less than 25% of our \nweight, have babies every three years, so we are really churning out offspring for an \nape of our size.  \n \nThe reason we think human females can do this is a division of labour.  The female \nOrang-utan does it on her own; no one is feeding her and it is her own energy going \ninto reproduction, whereas in a human system several people are contributing to \nraising offspring.  Some anthropologists have argued that the father is the main \ncontributor and that is why we have evolved a division of labour and very strong pair \nbonds in human societies.  Others have argued that is it not the father but the \ngrandmother that is crucial.  This explanation could account for the long \npost-reproductive lifespan. We could have evolved after a certain age to stop trying \nto produce children of our own and concentrate on helping our daughter to reproduce \nand raise children. This is the grandmother hypothesis for the evolution of \nmenopause. \n \nCo-operative Breeding \nThis hypothesis suggests that we are evolved as a co-operatively breeding species, \nan interesting idea that I decided to test.  There is in the Gambia a study of \n 10 \ndemographic records of births and deaths going back to 1949 in four villages which \nhas enabled us to measure the importance of communal efforts to raise children.  \nOne way of testing which relatives really matter is to statistically analyse the effect of \na certain relative dying on the probability that a child will die.  What difference does \nyour mother, your father or your grandmother dying make to your own survival? \nSince this historical data set covered a period when about 40% of children died \nbefore the age of five, there was a lot of data to work with. \n \nTo summarise our results from this Gambian village, briefly, death of a mother \nenormously increases the risk a child under the age of two dying, although \ninterestingly not children over the age of two.  The only other people that affected \nsurvival chances were maternal grandmothers and elder sisters. Thus matrilineal \nrelatives all influenced survival, but death of fathers or other patrilineal relatives did \nnot make any difference (Mace & Sear 2005). One can then develop models to \ncalculate if these effects have been big enough to actually drive the evolution of the \nmenopause. In brief, they more or less do.  Assuming that grandmothers, by stopping \nreproduction, can actually help their daughters\u2019 children survive, and speed up their \ndaughters\u2019 reproductive rate, then it is possible that menopause can evolve as an \nadaptation (Shanley et al 2007).  Since our study, and another on the Ache in \nParaguay, a huge number of other studies have taken place.  Again, like our own, the \ndata was largely out there already but people just had not thought to look at it in this \nway until they started taking an evolutionary perspective. \n \nEnergy Balance \nIn another demographic study in Ethiopia a development agency had installed water \npumps and we were interested in the effect of such an energy saving initiative on life \nhistory.  Previously women had to walk great distances to collect water, carrying \nreally heavy pots that I could not even lift. Comparing different villages we found as \npredicted that infant mortality fell as a result of this very welcome improvement. But \nwe were also interested in the effects of the changing energy balance of women. As \nevolutionary biologists, we suspected that having more energy might speed up the \nrate at which women had babies, which is exactly what happened.  Before the taps, \n70% of women had not given birth again before within two years, but after the taps, \n50% had. This quite significant hike in fertility actually precipitated some malnutrition.  \nIf we look at height for age for children up to the age of about five, the higher birth \nrate was associated with a slight and measurable increase in malnutrition (Gibson & \nMace 2006). This side-effect is not intuitively obvious but if taking a life history \napproach enables us to explain it. \n \nConclusion \nWhy use an evolutionary approach?  It generates testable hypotheses.  I am not \narguing that any one hypothesis is true or not true.  I am saying that we have to test \nthem.  Moreover, the answers to these questions do not lie in what people think is \ngoing on; they are not about individual interpretations.  Even though I said there were \nthree schools of thought, I realise that is already out of date.  I like Sam\u2019s phrase \nabout non-disciplinary science because I realise that what started off as socio-biology \nthen grew into these other things (Evolutionary demography, which I just talked \nabout, Evolutionary economics, which Gary mentioned earlier)  Sociobiology has \ngrown up and 20 minutes is not long enough to tell you everything that is going on \nand what it gave rise to, but hopefully I have given you enough to convince you that it \nis an interesting and expanding field.  I will stop there. \n \n 11 \nDarwinism and the Social Sciences \nGeoffrey Hodgson \n \nEvolution \nSince the early 1980s I have described myself as an institutional and evolutionary \neconomist. I shall explain later how institutions and evolution are connected. \nEvolutionary economics is a wide and diverse field of enquiry. Even more broadly, \nevolutionary labels and ideas are increasingly popular in the social sciences. I wish to \nmake some points about the value of Darwinism and its importance for social \nscientists. These points go further than the recognition of the biological aspects of \nhumanity and the fact of human evolution. \n \nThe term \u2018evolution\u2019 encompasses a variety of meanings and Charles Darwin did not \nuse it very often. It was Herbert Spencer rather than Darwin who popularised the \nterm. Etymologically, the word refers literally to the unrolling of something like a \nscroll, but in the modern context it means virtually anything connected with change. I \nam quite happy using an inclusive term such as \u2018evolutionary economics\u2019 but such \nlabels do not convey more than a minimal meaning. \n \nI wish to promote a more refined meaning or type of evolution. Darwinism is one of \nseveral different evolutionary paradigms that have appeared over the centuries, and \nit is the only successful one in my view. Others rely on unexplained processes, \npresumed sequences of stages, or teleological ends. Whether the Lamarckian \ninheritance of acquired characteristics does or does not occur, Lamarckism is not a \ncomplete theory of evolution because it relies on Darwinian principles including \nselection (Dawkins, 1983; Hodgson and Knudsen, 2006a, 2006b). Darwinism is the \nonly adequate general causal theory of evolutionary change in complex systems with \nvaried entities. However, within evolutionary economics the promotion of Darwinism \nis a minority standpoint, and it has been subject to criticism and dispute. \n \nGenetics \nAs my economic historian friend Joel Mokyr remarked at a recent conference, \n\u2018Darwinism is too important to be left to the biologists\u2019. As a biologist, Darwin did a lot \nof empirical work. His papers and books contain an enormous amount of detailed \ninformation. With inspiration from economics and other disciplines, he developed his \ntheory of natural selection. Darwin also hinted at the possibility that his core set of \ntheoretical ideas have a wider relevance and usage: they apply to other evolving \nsystems. This has been subsequently recognised by a number of authors including \nThorstein Veblen (1899, 1919) and Donald T. Campbell (1964).  \n \nGeneralising Darwinism does not mean genetic or biological reductionism. The term \n\u2018gene\u2019 was introduced after Darwin\u2019s death. Darwin did not have any inkling about \nhow the inheritance mechanism worked, yet he developed a general theory of \nevolutionary change. Darwinism is the only systemic theory of evolution we have to \nhelp explain a wide variety of evolutionary phenomena. On Planet Earth of course, \ngenes are important in biological transmission. However, the core message of \nDarwinism does not depend on genes. As Richard Dawkins (1983) put it in an \ninteresting thought experiment, one can imagine another planet where there is no \nDNA. Instead there are organisms running around and reproducing by some other \nmechanism. Nevertheless, as Dawkins argued at length, Darwinian principles would \nstill apply. \n 12 \n \nCore Darwinian Principles \nLet us elaborate this argument. Darwinian theory refers to populations of entities. \nThese populations could be of biological organisms or even relatively sophisticated \nrobots. Imagine a science fiction world of robots that learn and adapt in their struggle \nto survive. To avoid degradation and overcome problems, they receive information, \nand absorb energy and matter from their environment. They can also reproduce \nthemselves. No two robots are identical (at least in terms of the information they \nhold), so some have relative advantages in some circumstances over others. Robots \ndevelop solutions to problems and environmental challenges. Problem solutions, like \nusing an umbrella to protect them from rain and rusting, can be communicated from \nrobot to robot. Some robots fail and cease functioning. \n \nWith this population there is an imperative to survive, a capacity to replicate, some \nlocal scarcity of resources and competition over those resources between these \nrobots. Obviously these principles also apply, in general terms, to biological \norganisms. The next step is to ask if they also apply to human social entities such as \nsocial institutions. \n \nOne of the central issues in economics is to understand how firms compete. \nEconomists consider what firms are, how they compete, how they survive, the \npattern of their life cycles, and so on. Do populations of firms qualify as evolving \nentities like the robots and organisms considered above? Ostensibly yes. Firms are \ndissimilar, compete with other firms, and pass on problem solutions. So we have \nsocial entities which fit the same abstract description to which Darwinian principles \napply. \n \nAfter taking this first step, we must look at the detailed ways and mechanisms \nthrough which these particular entities retain problem solutions, pass them on, \nreplicate and so on. However, as well as looking at the real world, getting our hands \ndirty and doing empirical research, we need to be clear what the Darwinian principles \nare.  \n \nVariation, Inheritance and Selection \nIt is widely appreciated that there are three basic Darwinian principles concerning \nvariation, inheritance and selection. Slightly different terms are used by different \nauthors, but that need not concern us here. \n1. Variation \nDarwinism addresses a world of variation, and it requires some explanation of how \nthat variety is created and sustained through time. With evolution at the genetic level, \nmutation and genetic recombination are the mechanisms that generate and renew \nvariety in the gene pool. The details of how variety is generated with robots, or with \nalien species on another planet, or with social entities in the human domain, will be \nvery different from the mechanisms applying to genes. But there must be some \nexplanation of how variety is maintained and generated. In the human social domain, \nwriters have considered various mechanisms, such as communication error, \nindividual curiosity and entrepreneurship as possible variety-creating processes. \n2. Inheritance \nInheritance or replication refers to how information and problem solutions are passed \non from one entity to another, and through time. There must be some detailed story \nabout how this information is acquired and how it is passed on. For example, \naddressing firm-to-firm information transmission, do firms learn from one another? Do \n 13 \nthey copy their production techniques? Do their managers go to Harvard and get \nMBAs and get their solutions from there? What are the mechanisms by which one \nfirm learns from another? What is the relative importance of diffusion over \ninnovation? What is the role of the entrepreneur? These questions have different \ndetailed answers but they are prompted by the general Darwinian framework, when \napplied to social or economic evolution. \n3. Selection \nThe third Darwinian principle is selection. For Darwin, natural selection was not the \nonly selection mechanism. He discussed sexual selection as well (Darwin 1871). \nSelection is a broad concept and it does not necessarily mean that the selection \nenvironment is given or constant. Furthermore, selection does not always lead to the \nsurvival of the fittest. Biologists have shown that selection can sometimes lead to \nmaladaptive or inefficient outcomes. There are several ways in which this can occur, \nbut they generally involve interactive feedback between individuals, or between \nindividuals and their environments. The peacock\u2019s tail is a good example. It results \nfrom an interactive processes of sexual selection, and results in outcomes that are \nhighly cumbersome for the male. \n \nInteractions that lead to inefficient outcomes are also commonplace in the social \ndomain. For example, there is a recent literature on institutional complementarities. \nThis shows how firm competition and selection is affected by other institutions, such \nas banks or state organisations. Globally less efficient firms may prosper because \nthe institutional environment favours them, rather than their globally more efficient \nrivals. \n \nBy contrast, some questionable accounts of Darwinism in economics invoke a \nnarrower and potentially apologetic argument, where the principle of selection is said \nto demonstrate that the fittest firms are the ones that actually exist. Among others, \nMilton Friedman promoted this view. Critics within economics such as Sidney Winter \nhave shown that this is not necessarily true. Selection always works in relation to a \nparticular environment. It rarely leads to the global efficiency optimum and often \ngravitates to local optima instead. Furthermore, given strong interactive effects and \nchanging environments, such local optima can be fragile and transient. \n \nSocial Evolution \nMy own work involves the refinement and application of Darwinian principles, \nparticularly in the business and institutional contexts. The idea of applying these \nprinciples to social entities goes back to Darwin himself, when he argued that his \nideas could also apply to the evolution of language (Darwin 1859:422-3;  \n1871:59-61). In 1872, the economist and political theorist Walter Bagehot produced a \nshort book that applied Darwinian principles to the evolution of political institutions. In \nthe 1890s, Veblen applied Darwinian ideas to the evolution of social and economic \ninstitutions. These earlier attempts were largely forgotten during a period when social \nscientists reacted strongly against the use of any ideas from biology. Some time after \nthe Second World War, Campbell and a few others resuscitated the idea of \ngeneralising Darwinian principles to social and other domains. \n \nWorking within a Darwinian framework, several contemporary researchers uphold \nthat information transmission can occur on multiple levels, including one or more \nsocial levels. Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson (1985) have developed a theory of \n\u2018dual inheritance\u2019 with information being transmitted both culturally and genetically. \nThis theory has been enormously successful and it is now being applied to firms and \nother social institutions. \n 14 \n \nWhat do we mean by information, and what is the carrier of information at the social \nlevel? In 1976 Richard Dawkins coined the term \u2018meme\u2019 to refer to a unit of cultural \ninformation. It is a popular term but it does not tell us very much. There is huge \nconfusion about what memes are. Are they behaviours? Are they propensities? Are \nthey bits of information or memory traces? The confusion has not abated. Unless \nmore is said about what a meme is, and how it is replicated, then the term does not \nget us very far. \n \nWe need also to get behind the notion of information, because it is problematic in \nboth the biological and social sphere. In what sense is DNA information? We need to \nconsider the kind of information transmission processes that play a key role in \nevolutionary change. \n \nA more refined and useful analogy is that of a computer program. The biologist Ernst \nMayr (1988) developed the concept of \u2018programme-based behaviour\u2019 that has \nenormous but largely unrecognised implications for the social sciences. Instead of \nunderstanding the mind as an all-purpose rational calculator, it is regarded as being \ndriven by conditional psychological mechanisms or \u2018programs\u2019. Such programs \ninclude habits or instincts. Habits, of course, are culturally dependent. Within this \nperspective is fully acknowledged humans can often modify or over-ride their \nprograms by conscious will. But our will is not independent of our evolution or our \nunderlying dispositions. \n \nAt the firm or organisational level, there are higher-level \u2018programs\u2019 corresponding to \nhabits or dispositions at the individual level. Ever since the pioneering 1982 book by \nRichard Nelson and Sidney Winter, these organisation-level programs have been \nreferred to as routines. Nelson and Winter compared routines with genes, suggesting \nthat that they were both evolutionary replicators, despite their detailed differences. \nThere is now a large empirical and theoretical literature on routines, addressing such \nissues as how they act as repositories of knowledge and how they are replicated \nfrom organisation to organisation. \n \nIf routines are replicators, then organisations and institutions are their \u2018vehicles\u2019 or \n\u2018interactors\u2019 (to use the terms of Richard Dawkins (1976) and David Hull (1988), \nrespectively). As Veblen argued over a hundred years ago, institutions are selected \nin the process of social evolution. It is here that \u2018institutional economics\u2019 and \n\u2018evolutionary economics\u2019 merge into one. \n \nAccordingly, part of the current research agenda in this area involves an interaction \nbetween the application of Darwinian principles to the evolution of social entities, on \nthe one hand, and the refinement of those principles in the light of their hugely \nwidened domain of application, on the other. The generalisation of Darwinian \nprinciples is a very lively area of research that has promoted much current discussion \nand criticism. \n \nBiological Analogies \nOne criticism is that all this is stretching biological analogies too far. In response, the \nargument is not about analogies at all. In saying that Darwinian principles apply to \nevolving social entities, it is not claimed that the mechanisms involved are similar to \nbiological mechanisms. There is nothing at the social level that remotely corresponds \nto DNA. At the level of detail, the mechanisms are generally very different. This point \nis important, but it does not undermine the project to generalise Darwinian principles \nto other spheres, including social evolution. \n \n 15 \nPhilosopher of biology David Hull (1988) has pointed out that these Darwinian \nprinciples have a general character partly because of the huge variety of \nmechanisms within biology itself. Consider the procreation of grasses. They multiply \nbasically by seeds or by underground stems or suckers. Suckers involve the \ntransmission of identical DNA, but it creates a new plant. This method of replication is \nvery different from that involving seeds and fertilisation. There are also different \nmethods of replication for single-cell and multi-cell entities, for invertebrates and \nvertebrates, and so on. Even within biology it is misconception to say Darwinian \nprinciples are narrowly focused on one type of mechanism. They are very broad \nprinciples which can accommodate a huge variety of mechanisms. \n \nAnalogy is different from generalisation. Analogy compares one particular with \nanother. By contrast, generalisation assembles a wide range of diverse particulars, \nand attempts to make meaningful and useful generalisations that apply to them all. \nDarwinism involves a special form or generalisation that combines over-arching \ngeneral principles with auxiliary explanations that apply only in specific \ncircumstances. It powerfully combines the general with the particular. \n \nConclusion \nThis research programme is still in the early stages. It is largely in a pre-empirical, \nconceptual and exploratory phase. But a great deal of progress has been made. In \nrecent years, philosophers of biology have done a lot of useful work in honing down \nthe key concepts. They have refined, for example, the concept of the replicator and \nidentified its essential features. The concept of selection has also been formalised \nand greatly clarified. To begin applying these ideas to economic or business \nphenomena, we need adequately precise general definitions of these terms. \nSubsequently, we must take in a mass of ongoing empirical research, that helps us \nfurther to understand the detailed mechanisms and processes. Hopefully in the near \nfuture we shall demonstrate the value of the over-arching Darwinian framework and \ngenerate some testable hypotheses. \n \nThis research involves multiple disciplines. First, some acquaintance with both \nbiology and the philosophy of biology is required to understand the core Darwinian \nprinciples. Second, the social scientist must use insights from psychology and \nelsewhere to understand how humans learn and replicate information. Third, \napplications of Darwinian evolutionary ideas are now found in several related \ndisciplines such as economics, politics, sociology, organisation science, \nanthropology, law, philosophy and archaeology. The social evolutionist has to gain \ninsights from the work of others in several disciplines. \n \nWe cannot predict where this line of research will lead us. Nevertheless, we have \nalready made enough progress to show that Darwinism has a great importance as a \nframework for understanding evolution in the social domain as well as the biological. \nSocial scientists should abandon their fears and misunderstandings concerning \nDarwinism and get to grips with this burgeoning research programme. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 \nA New Social Darwinism ? \n \nMichael Rustin \n \n \nBiological Darwinism \nFirst, I would like to make a distinction  between \u2018biological Darwinism\u2019 and the \ntransposition by way of analogy or metaphor  of Darwinian ideas of variation, \nreplication and selection to the social sphere.  Some  versions of \u2018biological \nDarwinism\u2019 have been very unwelcome to social scientists, who have defended, often \nas a radical social constructionism,  the idea that the \u2018social\u2019  is not determined in any \nway by biological substrates. \n \nI regard this rejection of Darwinist explanations as wrong \u2013 after all, mortality and \nreproduction are natural facts, and all individuals and societies and individuals have \nto cope with these.  Biology has a primary causal role in human affairs, mediated by \nsocial process as it must be. I also  think that some strictly Darwinian ideas, applied \nto the \u2018social\u2019 are illuminating, though I do not think of myself as a \u2018social Darwinist\u2019.   \n \nI have in mind the investigations of the development of human infants and children, \nas these have been studied by attachment theorists following the work of John \nBowlby (1972, 1973, 1988) and by psychoanalysts (of whom Bowlby was originally \none. For comparison of these two perspectives, see Fonagy 2001). Both of these \ntheoretical approaches  draw attention to the similarities between the needs of \nmammals, in particular primates, in their early nurture, and the needs of human \ninfants.  In Bowlby\u2019s terms, if human infants are deprived of a secure attachment to a \nsustaining mother figure in their first year or two of life, some of the capacities which \nthey would develop in those conditions will be damaged in their absence.  They  will \nbe likely to become more insecure, anxious,  dependent or conflictful, and will be \nmore likely to have difficulties in fulfilling the role they may later have as parents. \nImpressive empirical studies (Bretherton and Waters 1985) have validated and \nelaborated these ideas, enabling  investigations of the learned modes of attachment \nof parents, inferred from their descriptions of their own children, to predict the \nprobable modes of attachment of children, even yet unborn.  (Current political \nprogrammes directed to improving the qualities of nurture in the \u2018early years\u2019 draw on \nthese ideas and findings).  \n \nSarah Blaffer Hrdy   in her book Mother Nature (1999) has taken these \nunderstandings further, from an evolutionist point of view. She has  proposed that the \nvulnerable conditions of infants in hunter-gatherer societies have led the selection of \ncertain \u2018survival strategies\u2019 to become genetically encoded in the constitution of \nhuman infants. They are at  risk of abandonment by their mothers, and to competition \nfrom siblings, in conditions of scarcity.  Furthermore they are at risk should their \nmother find herself with a sexual partner who is not the infant\u2019s own father.  Thus, \nHrdy argues, human infants have evolved to  be highly attractive to their parents, and \nindeed to adults in general, as well as having a piercing capacity to make any \ndistress or fear they may feel known to all in their locality.     \n \nMore unexpectedly, Hrdy\u2019s evolutionary perspective, drawing on the sociobiological \nwork of Robert Trivers (2002) explains why there is an inherent ambivalence in the \nrelationship between infants and their mothers, and between infants and siblings, and \nwhy infants have reason for suspicion of   parental sexual activity which is likely to \nlead to the birth of new babies, and thus competitors. As the philosopher Jim Hopkins \n(2003) has pointed out,  Melanie Klein\u2019s description of the anxieties and inner \n 17 \nconflicts inherent  in the relationships of early infancy, so at odds with sentimental \nidealisation of the mother-infant bond, finds a new support in these conjectures.  In \nHrdy\u2019s view, even the mother and her and the baby\u2019s placenta may be competitors \nfor survival in times of scarcity, as well as later the mother and her newborn infant.  \nHrdy makes clear why it is that the abandonment of infants at extreme moments has \nbeen a rational survival strategy.  The potential for conflict between mother and \ninfant, for Oedipal anxieties concerning  father,  and possible displacement by new \nbabies,  and mothers\u2019 capacity for anxiety concerning  their capacity to sustain their \nbabies (and their need for support in doing so) are rendered more intelligible if we \nthink ourselves back to the hunter-gatherer era in which human  genetic endowments \nwere set down. \n \nThe research of Bowlbian attachment theorists, and of  psychoanalysts in the British \nobject-relations tradition who share some presuppositions with them, has developed \nwithin a particular ethical perspective, linked to a commitment to  renewed social \nintegration and community solidarity which was influential in Britain in the post-war \nperiod in which Bowlby began his work.  Evolutionist arguments about  \u2018human \nnature\u2019 have thus been deployed in support of a preferred conception of social \nrelations. This need not be an illicit procedure, so long as it is recognised that such \ndescriptions of the consequences of different kinds of social organisation (including \npatterns of child-rearing) do not replace moral judgements, by conflating fact and \nvalue, but do identify some  factual constraints on choices between feasible  ways of \nlife.  \n \nSociological Darwinism \nNow to the application of Darwinist perspectives to sociological and anthropological \nanalysis.  I agree with Geoffey Hodgson that the distinction between genotype and \nphenotype seems fundamental to making use of the Darwinian analogy for the \nunderstanding of social development, since it is so central to Darwin\u2019s own theory. \n(Roughly speaking, in nature, if you are a sparrow there is no point in learning to \nswim.)  In society, what are the equivalent limits to individuals\u2019 freedom of action, and \nhow far do Darwinian processes of variation and replication  help in understanding \nthem?  It was a major contribution of sociology and anthropology to show that there \nwere such limits, or to put this is another way, that  choices always have to \nnegotiated within a field of possibilities.  Such limits may be determined by culture \n(what it is possible to think or feel within a given milieu), by the distribution of power, \nand  by material resources, in various combinations. \u2018Men make history, but in \ncircumstances not of their own choosing,\u2019 as Marx put it. The question is how far do \nDarwinian ideas improve on the various classical sociological framings of this \nquestion, which have tended  to focus, within the traditions of the subject  (Durkheim, \nWeber, Marx and their descendants)  on one or other of these three \u2018power \ndimensions\u2019 (Giddens 1971). The question is whether  Darwinism contributes a \ndistinctive new mode of explanation, in addition to explanations by reference to \ngenetic templates (e.g. hunter-gatherer or mammalian dispositions) whose positive \nvalue I have discussed above. \n \nThe problem seems to be that the more  Darwinian accounts seek to accommodate \nthe facts of cultural transmission, and to take account of what in evolutionary debates \nis termed the \u2018inheritance of acquired characteristics\u2019, the more they  depart from the \nframing  of Darwin\u2019s own theory, in the  direction of the Lamarckian position which \nDarwin\u2019s theory of natural selection defeated.  The clarity of the Darwinian \nprogramme, which has been maintained throughout its successive stages from \nDarwin, through Mendel\u2019s idea  of  genes and chromosomes, to the biochemical and \ninformational mapping of the genome,  lies in the fact that  inheritable characteristics \n\u2013 what Geoff Hodgson refers to above as replicators, remain conceptually and in \n 18 \nreality to a large degree distinct from the processes by which they are selected. \n\u2018Variation\u2019 and \u2018selection\u2019 take place so to speak in different conceptual spaces.    \nHow far can this separation be sustained in extensions of Darwinian thinking to  the \nsocial and cultural spheres?  I would like to suggest a distinction between those \nsocial forms in which the separation between \u2018variation\u2019 and \u2018selection\u2019 is strong, and \nthose where it is weak or absent. Example of the former are producer markets in \nwhich incremental innovations are \u2018selected for\u2019 by competition, scientific activity \nwhere variations are \u2018selected\u2019 by the decisions of a larger scientific community, and \ninnovations in art forms, where once again  selection of successful variants (new \ngenres, forms, or  techniques) is independent of their production. All of these \nanalogues to Darwinian competition seem, incidentally, to be products of liberal kinds \nof social organisation.   \n \nContrast these with systems where power holders successfully control variation (in \nthe economy, in the arts, in ideas) as a primary strategy for maintaining their \ndominance.  State socialism is such an instance.  In one system, variation and \nselection are (deliberately) structured as separate processes, in the other, such \nseparation is vigorously resisted. Very different patterns of innovation, diffusion and \nselection will obtain in these different systems.  In so far as Darwinism is to be seen \nas a resource for understanding specific patterns of innovation and diffusion (as in \nthe work described above by Ruth Mace) it will have  different  applications in the two \ncases.  In the first, these may be quite close to its biological and ecological source \nfield, in the latter more remote from it. 1 \n \nOne can argue that on a larger social  scale, there will be competition between these \nsystems themselves, as in the Cold War between capitalism and communism, or \nnowadays perhaps in a struggle for dominance between more and less regulated  \nforms of capitalism.  But there seem likely to be great differences in the form of \napplication of Darwinist models at these different levels, and where the modes of \nvariation and selection are so differently configured. To call of these forms of contest \nand competition \u2018Darwinist seems to achieve an apparent universal scope at the \nexpense of explanatory precision.  \n \nIt seems an interesting fact about the Darwinist paradigm that its most precise \napplication is to forms of structured competition  which occur and are valued within a \nparticular kind of social order.  \u2018Social Darwinism\u2019 in its early nineteenth century days \nwas  mapped on to an ideology of unbridled economic individualism, which led to the \nrejection of Darwinism by many sociologists, even  to this day.  But if we see that the \napplication of Darwinist principles to social explanation now requires the \nunderstanding not only of the processes of  competition,  but also of the institutional \nand regulatory conditions necessary to sustain them, we can see the possibilities for \na Darwinism which is  more genuinely social than hitherto.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1\n The \u2018actor network\u2019 theory of Bruno Latour and his colleagues (Latour 2005)  considerably \ncomplicates the idealised model which posits a state of \u2018perfect competition\u2019  between \nscientists and their discoveries. The success and spread of  depends on the conceptual  links \nthey are able to establish in various fields, and also on the substantive alliances that scientists \nare able to achieve with for example funding sources who can sustain further research. This \nsuggests that modelling the processes of variation and selection in science (and other fields) \nis much more complex than a classical conception of \u2018separation\u2019 can capture.  Agency is \nassigned to many kinds of \u2018actant\u2019, human and non-human, in Latour\u2019s view.  There may be \nfruitful links  to be made here with Darwinian mappings.  \n 19 \n \n 20 \nReferences \nBagehot, Walter (1872) Physics and Politics, or, Thoughts on the Application of the \nPrinciples of \u2018Natural Selection\u2019 and \u2018Inheritance\u2019 to Political Society (London: \nHenry King). \nBowlby, J.
