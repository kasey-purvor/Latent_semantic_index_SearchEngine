The aim of the research was to examine the processes by which non-\nprofessionals make ethical evaluations in relation to a contested area in medical \ngenetics. We note in particular the role played in the discussions by expressions of \ninstinct; making distinctions; rational argument; reference to principles; use of \npersonal experience; analogies and examples; slippery slope arguments and meta- \nreflections. The implications for developing processes of public consultation and \ndebate are also considered.   \n \n \nKey words: lay public, ethics, genetics. \n \nThe lay public and the new genetics \nThe wide-ranging implications of contemporary developments in genetics and \nreproductive medicine have led to a number of concerns about the development of \npublic understanding of the science involved; the engagement of the lay public in \ndiscussion of the social and ethical implications of these technologies; and \nconsultation through surveys and other exercises to gauge public attitudes. \nOpportunities for public consultation are increasingly being employed by government \nbodies, academic institutions, charities and other organisations (see, for example, \nHuman Fertilization and Embryology Authority, 2003; Human Genetics Commission, \n2001; Human Genetics Commission, 2004; Wellcome Trust, 1998). At the same time \nthere is a developing critique of how such consultations, especially opinion surveys, \nare conducted and used (Davison et al, 1997; Kerr and Shakespeare, 2002, 174-7) and \na recognition of the complexity of public opinions (Irwin, 2001; Irwin and Wynne, \n1996; Miller, 2001). Some critics continue to argue against public consultation on the \ngrounds that important science and technology policies should be left to experts who \nare best qualified to decide (Lloyd, 2000). In a recently published exchange Harris \n(2005a, 2005b) was highly critical of the attention paid to public opinion in the 2003 \nHuman Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) report on prenatal sex \n 3\nselection. His concern was not only with the possible ignorance of the lay public \nabout the issues, but more fundamentally that their opinions were \u2018unsupported by \nevidence or valid arguments [and] impossible to distinguish from prejudices\u2019 (Harris, \n2005b, 291) and should therefore not have been taken seriously by the HFEA. \n \nAre Harris and others justified in their dismissal of the views of \u2018the public\u2019 collected \nduring the consultation? These critiques raise questions about whether an \u2018opinion\u2019, to \nbe taken seriously, has to be supported by factual evidence or logical argument; what \ncounts as evidence and a valid argument; and how we construct \u2018expert\u2019 and \u2018lay\u2019 \nknowledge and opinions and decide what weight to give them. While several studies \nhave concluded that there is a need to listen to and treat as valid a variety of non-\nprofessional perspectives on health and well-being (Kerr et al., 1998; Michie et al., \n1995; Richards, 1996), less attention has been paid to the actual processes the lay \npublic uses in making ethical evaluations about novel biomedical issues. This theme \nis the focus of the present paper.  \n \nThe ordinary ethics project \nThe ideas presented here are drawn from a UK Wellcome Trust-funded research \nproject exploring lay people\u2019s ethical evaluations of the new genetics and \nreproductive technologies. By \u2018lay people\u2019 we mean those not professionally involved \nin the field as clinicians, scientists or bioethicists. By \u2018ethical evaluations\u2019 we mean \nthe broad process of identifying, exploring and prioritising the ethical issues at stake, \noffering a judgement on what is regarded as right or wrong and\/or what ought or \nought not to be done, and giving reasons or justifications for these judgements. \nEthical evaluation therefore encompasses more than ethical decision-making about \nwhat to do in a particular case or in general.  An ethical evaluation may involve an \nactual decision, but it may also contribute to developing a stance towards an issue. It \ngoes beyond the mere articulation of attitudes and opinions, offering reasons or \nexplanations for holding certain views.  \n \nTo investigate the process of lay ethical evaluation we held ten discussions with \ndifferent groups of people during 2002-4 in the north east of England. As an issue for \nevaluation, we chose prenatal sex selection (PSS) using preimplantation genetic \ndiagnosis (PGD). In the UK sex selection using PGD is allowed for \u2018medical\u2019 reasons \n 4\n(to avoid having a child with a sex-related medical condition) but not for \u2018social\u2019 \nreasons (for example, for family balancing), although this is being questioned at the \ntime of writing (House of Commons Committee on Science and Technology, 2005). \nIn a number of other countries it is legal, and there are cases of British people going \nabroad for treatment (Boseley, 2003). At the time our research started, the HFEA \n(2002) was about to embark on its public consultation on sex selection. So this was a \ntopical issue.  \n \nThe participants in the groups volunteered to engage in a discussion on an unspecified \ntopic, having been approached individually or through local organisations to which \nthey belonged. A list of the groups is given in the Appendix. They covered a range of \nage, gender, class and disability perspectives.  There were no groups convened from \nspecifically religious, cultural or minority ethnic organisations or groupings. All \ngroups received a brief introduction to PGD and sex selection. To initiate and focus \nthe discussion we then used a scenario about a couple wishing to use PGD to select \nthe sex of their next child. In the majority of groups, the following starting scenario \nwas used: \n \nImagine a couple who have three daughters. They plan to have another child, \nand want to use PGD to make sure they have a son. \n \nUsing a scenario differs from simply asking: \u2018Should people be allowed to select the \nsex of their children using PGD?\u2019, which is how questions tend to be framed in public \nconsultations such as that undertaken by the HFEA. Offering a scenario, however \nsketchy, invites participants to imagine a real case, consider what other information \nthey would need to know about this particular case to make a judgement about it,  \nconsider other people\u2019s reasons and motives, and so on. It leaves an opening for a less \nabstract discussion, and allows participants to co-construct contextual features of the \nscenario that they find relevant.  \n  \nThe discussions lasted between 50 and 90 minutes. Each was facilitated by a \nresearcher who, after introducing the scenario and asking people to reflect \nindividually, invited their initial reactions. The aim was to have a fairly free-ranging \ndiscussion, with the facilitator intervening occasionally to seek clarification, to \n 5\nsummarise or to move the discussion on by offering variants of the starting scenario. \nDepending on which topics the groups had already addressed of their own accord, the \nfacilitator would ask whether it would make any difference if there were existing \nchildren of the \u2018wrong\u2019 sex in the family balancing scenario; if the parents came from \nanother culture; if they wanted to select to avoid an inherited disability instead of a \nparticular sex; or if they wanted to select for a disability. We were not asking the \ngroups to come to a consensus, but to articulate and discuss their reasons for their \ninitial opinions. At the end participants were asked to say whether they had changed \ntheir minds as a result of the discussion, and if so, what had caused the shift. The \nmajority opinion in all groups was that sex selection for family balancing was not \nacceptable - 40 out of 48 participants (83%) reported holding this view at the end of \nthe discussion groups. \n \nThe discussions were transcribed and then organised using the qualitative data \nanalysis package NVivo (Bazeley and Richards, 2000; Gibbs, 2002). Although this \npackage is often used in a grounded theory approach to data analysis (Strauss and \nCorbin, 1990), we undertook a more generic form of preliminary qualitative analysis, \nthe aim of which was to uncover discursive themes and processes recurring within \nand across the discussion groups in order to subject them to more detailed study.  \n \nSubstantive issues \nA first observation is that the substantive issues raised by our participants were \nessentially the same as those covered in the academic bioethics literature and in public \npolicy debates. Most groups covered the parental right to choice, the risk of gender \nimbalance, the potential for reinforcing gender stereotypes, whether preference for \none sex is discriminatory, and the risk of psychological damage to the child. In other \nwords, these lay discussants were collectively aware of the key issues at stake in the \nexpert debates about sex selection (see Benagiano and Bianchi, 1999; Berkowitz and \nSnyder, 1998; Ford, 2002; Henn, 2000; Human Fertilization and Embryology \nAuthority, 2002; Institute of Ideas, 2002; Pennings, 1996; Revill, 2003; Rhodes, \n2001; Savulescu, 1999; Warren, 1999). The two major omissions (safety and efficacy \nof the technique of PGD, and debate about the moral status of the embryo) may reflect \nrespectively the lack of technical familiarity, and the tendency noted by other \nresearchers for lay people to focus on concrete relationships with others rather than \n 6\ntheory (see Rapp, 2000).  The overlap with the content of professional discussion is \nnot surprising, since everyday talk and professional discourse influence and draw on \neach other. Nevertheless, it provides some evidence to counter the claim that public \nawareness of the relevant issues is inadequate. \n \nThe process of ethical evaluation \nWe were primarily interested in the evaluative processes participants used to identify \nthe issues at stake and to justify their opinions. From the analysis we identified \nseveral main components of these evaluative processes, which we discuss below. \n \nExpressing an instinct or gut feeling   \nIn all groups, the facilitator started by asking participants to share their initial \nreactions to the scenario. It was common for people to start the discussion by \nreference to their initial, instinctive feeling about it: \n \nI kind of felt very strongly, as soon as you said what kind of scenario it was - I \nsaid \u2018no\u2019 straight away. It was quite a gut reaction based on a couple of things. \n(Male social worker) \n \nI said \u2018no\u2019 [the couple should not be allowed to choose the sex of the embryo] \nand can\u2019t think of any specific reasons why; it\u2019s just a gut reaction. \n(Disability group) \n \n   \nMaking distinctions  \nTo explore why they might think PSS for social reasons was wrong, many participants \ntried first to distinguish it from selecting against disability. For example, a \npostgraduate student commented that PSS:  \n \nis more of a lifestyle choice than a medical condition that could be avoided, so \nit is a question of the level of seriousness. \n \n 7\nThe line between PGD and abortion was also probed. Groups debated whether PGD \nwas morally equivalent to abortion, and if not whether that made it ethically more \nacceptable. Here opinions differed: \n \nThere is a big difference between having the embryo outside of you [in PGD], \nor already there [inside]. That is my main concern. (Soroptimist) \n \n[PGD might be] pre-termination, yes, but it\u2019s the same principle though. \n(Soroptimist) \n \n \nRational\/logical argument  \nWe use \u2018rational argument\u2019 to mean the stepwise, logical argumentation characteristic \nof philosophy. In fact this kind of reasoned argument was rare, although there were \nsome examples. The following comes from the youth group when discussing \nenhancement and therapy:  \n \nIf you [can] help them get better, then should we help them die if they feel \npain?...if  you see someone is ill all the time, you should be able to help them \ndie? (Youth group) \n \nOccasionally, a participant would comment on logical contradictions in their own or \nothers\u2019 arguments, or show an awareness of the different elements of reasoning. For \nexample, in the following extract the participant was differentiating between the \npremise of an argument and its structure: \n \nI suppose...there is a rationality to almost everything in many respects, isn\u2019t \nthere? You know that even things that seem irrational there are perhaps some \nkind of rationality to them. I suppose it\u2019s the base on which it\u2019s built, it\u2019s the \nfoundation I think that\u2019s irrational. (Male social worker) \n \nReference to ethical principles \nDrawing on abstract ethical principles, derived from ethical theories, is a hallmark of \nprofessional ethical discourse.  Few of our lay discussants gave explicit statements of \n 8\nethical principle in support of their stance for or against PSS, and when they did so \ntended to indicate that principles might be unworkable in real life: \n \nWell, as a guiding principle, which doesn\u2019t always work, people I think should \nhave as much freedom for things which they themselves are going to be truly \naccountable as is reasonably possible. (Soroptimists) \n \nSometimes it\u2019s a clear cut thing...It is wrong to tell lies or it\u2019s wrong to steal \nand it\u2019s right not to. That\u2019s clear cut, but life isn\u2019t as clear as that. (Disability \ngroup) \n \nBut the relative lack of explicit statements of ethical principle does not necessarily \nmean that ethical principles were not used, or were unimportant to lay deliberations. \nWe discuss this in more detail in Shakespeare et al (2006), but as an example, much \nof the argument against parents choosing characteristics like gender was grounded in \nthe principle that the child\u2019s future freedom of choice should be respected. Although \nthis was only articulated as a principle in one or two discussions, our analysis \nsuggests that it was foundational to many more participants\u2019 thinking.  Thus principle-\nbased thinking was used quite extensively in the deliberations, but the principles \nthemselves were usually implicit. \n \nUse of personal experience \nBy far the most frequently used resource was personal experience, generally as a \nsource of evidence for a claim or to give a precedent for a decision. It included \nexperience of related medical areas (like IVF), analogous experiences (like adoption), \nor experiences illustrative of a single relevant feature (like being the only girl in a \nfamily of boys), and could involve the person themselves, or friends or relatives.  We \nhave numerous examples from all groups. Here is a short extract from the women\u2019s \ncommunity education group, where the participants drew extensively on their \naccounts of motherhood:  \n \nA: I wasn\u2019t bothered what I had, because it would have been love just the same \nanyway, so I wasn\u2019t bothered what it was, whether it was male or female. \n \n 9\nB: I must say my first child was my daughter and when my son was born I was \ndelighted to have one of each, so that I\u2019d have the added experience of \nbringing up one of each gender, but I also felt very nervous about bringing a \nson up because being a female myself I thought\u2026 \n \nC: Mothers usually are! \n \nIn one group of young people, a young man commented that he was against PSS, \nexplaining to the facilitator:  \n  \nYoung man: Yes, because I\u2019m the only boy out of 4 kids, and if you\u2019re the \nonly one of a certain sex it puts a bit more pressure on you, compared to the \nrest of the family.  \n \nFacilitator: So, because in this family there\u2019s three girls and one boy, and \nthat\u2019s like your family? \n \nYoung man: Yes. \n \nFacilitator: So you think that\u2019d be hard for the boy to come along? \n \nYoung man: Yes.  Especially as the youngest. \n \nPersonal experience was useful not only as an epistemological resource, but also in \njustification, since such experience carried significant moral authority. This authority \nmeant that other people\u2019s divergent opinions could be accepted on the dual grounds \nthat their experience was different, and that until one has had an experience one \ncannot credibly say what one\u2019s decisions and course of action would really be. As a \nparticipant in the women\u2019s community education group commented to another woman \nwith a disabled child:  \n \nYou\u2019re arguing though from a completely different perception to us \u2026  \nbecause you\u2019ve been there, haven\u2019t you?  \n \n 10\nAnalogies, parallels and examples \nWhere they lacked direct experience, people often used analogies and parallels.  \nAnalogies are useful for the analysis of unfamiliar ethical areas because they show \nhow a situation with a similar ethical structure has previously been tackled \u2013 who is \ntaken into account, what is morally salient, how priorities are arranged, and so on.  \nThis device has a philosophical background in the tradition of casuistry (see Jonsen \nand Toulmin, 1988). In the groups we observed, people did not search systematically \nfor a relevant parallel (as a true casuist would): rather, the parallel emerged in the \ncourse of discussion. It was then tested out to see how well it fitted the target situation \nand what its ethical implications were. \n \nThe most frequent analogy used was adoption, as a situation in which people may be \nable choose the sex of the (adopted) child, and also where the state intervenes in \nfamily life:  \n \nThere are families that make these choices now, not in terms of creating \nbeings, but adoptive families get a choice if they want male or female, able or \ndisabled, what age they want them to be, and stuff like that. (Male friendship \ngroup) \n \nNext most common were references to Nazi eugenics, indicating the consequences of \nmanipulating human characteristics: \n \nOne of the reasons we had World War Two was Hitler wanted a blue-eyed, \nblonde-haired superior race. (Disability group) \n \nSome participants were sensitive to the way they used analogies:  \n \nWell, I mean I think that\u2019s probably how I think and that\u2019s about trying to \nrelate things to things I know, particularly around things I don\u2019t know much \nabout....I suppose [adoption is] a useful analogy to think around some of those \nissues because you\u2019re dealing with things that are not hugely dissimilar in \nterms of outcome, you know where parents or potential parents are wanting to \nmake choices.  (Male social worker) \n 11\n \nParticipants also used examples from well-known historical or current events, or \nrelevant scientific or empirical research. Some historical examples were part of \npersonal reminiscences, as this member of the disability group commented in the \ncontext of discussing how social mores change: \n \nI remember when the Abortion Act came along from back streets into \nrespectable hospitals. There was still this big debate going on, yet now it\u2019s so \nmuch a part of everyday life - younger people talk about it in so matter of fact \na manner. That has evolved as well.  \n \nAccording to Ridley (1998, 60), \u2018in ethical argument there is hardly anything more \nimportant than the use of examples.\u2019 Professional ethics also often makes use of real \nor imaginary examples, to illustrate a principle or to visualise the consequences in a \n\u2018thought experiment\u2019. Classically these often involve extreme case scenarios, which \nhelp to establish the limits of the permissible or impermissible. Our participants \nsometimes did the same, asking \u2018what if?\u2019 questions or postulating hypothetical \nextremes. In discussing the case of a woman featured on a TV programme who \nwanted a girl \u2018to take shopping and dress up in girly clothes\u2019, one of the postgraduate \nprofessional students commented:  \n \nBut what if you had a girl who, not by genetics or environment or whatever, \njust turned out to be a complete tomboy...Would you be more disappointed \nbecause you had had a girl who wasn\u2019t a typical girl?  \n \nSlippery slope arguments \nRelated to these \u2018what if?\u2019 questions are slippery slope arguments. They follow from \nthe thought experiment that imagines: \u2018If we allow this, then what next?\u2019 and \nconcludes that there is nothing to stop the slide down the decision slope once the first \ndecision has been made. Some version of this occurred in every group discussion. \nSlippery slope discussions invoked the need to \u2018draw a line\u2019, and sometimes \nscepticism that drawing lines, or stopping the slide down the slope, is possible:  \n \n 12\nI suppose there is a part of me that feels if I\u2019m not black and white in my \nthinking about this and you tread into the grey areas, then where does the grey \narea stop. (Male social worker) \n \n \nMeta-reflections \nWhat we call meta-reflections are participants\u2019 comments on the nature of ethical \ndiscourse and ethical judgements, and on the process of ethical evaluation. We will \nhighlight two features.  \n \nOne was the place of emotion in ethical evaluation. A participant in the male \nfriendship group commented on the limitations of discussing PSS in purely rational or \ntechnical terms:  \n \nA: It\u2019s just using the rational part of the human, all this knowledge and \ninformation is just coming out of our rational minds. The other side isn\u2019t being \ntaken into consideration in a discussion like this at all, like, the emotional side, \nit\u2019s not really involved.   \n \nBut equally, later in the conversation another participant in the same group (C in the \nextract below) was wary of the dangers of emotional manipulation. Here, B is trying \nto work out his reasons for feeling unsure about PSS: \n \nB: \u2026. when it\u2019s a family with three daughters who want a son, my feelings \ncome up against the logic: \u2018why not\u2019? \n \nC:  People always come up with those fairly rare examples, to some extent, in \norder to choke up the old emotional response \u2026. \n \nDiscussions about the place of emotion led to considerations of objectivity and bias in \nethical judgement. A number of participants seemed sceptical that absolute objectivity \nis achievable, even if it were desirable, in real life ethical decisions: \n \n 13\nYou have to look at this body of intelligent, academic people who are \nscientists or whatever, who have made these rules [and see] that they are still \nhuman, they are still part of the culture of that country or various cultures \nwithin that country, so it\u2019s not as objective as people think. (Postgraduate \nprofessional student) \n \nA second significant meta-reflection was on the role of context in ethical judgement. \nMany of our participants took a situationist approach, in which the concrete details of \nthe situation are morally relevant to the final ethical judgement. Frequently, then, the \ninitial stages of discussion involved a kind of context assembly, guided by questions \nlike: \u2018Would it be a different scenario if all the children were under 5?\u2019; \u2018What \ncountry do they come from?\u2019 or \u2018We don\u2019t know how old they are\u2019. It seemed that \nparticipants needed to ground the issue in reality in order to go through the process of \nethical deliberation at all:   \n \nWherever you draw the line, there is going to be those real, marginal, tiny \nthings that make a difference. (Male friendship group) \n \nPeople were most likely to say this when discussing the scenario of PSS by a couple \nfrom an unfamiliar culture (for example, Asian or Middle Eastern).  A minority \neventually argued for cultural relativism, claiming that a white western group cannot \nknow what is ethically appropriate for another culture. But most other participants \nseemed more inclined to an epistemological, rather than ethical relativism, in which \nunderstanding the context within which a decision is made did not justify it, although \nit could provide mitigating factors. For example, when the older women\u2019s group \ndiscussed the killing of girl babies in India, the facilitator asked whether their \nresponse might be different if, in this culture, PSS might stop female babies being \nkilled:   \n \nFacilitator: Would you feel more sympathetic to the situation?  \n \nE: Feel sympathetic but I wouldn\u2019t do anything about it.  I\u2019d offer counselling \nto a particular family and put out a bit more information in general to see if \nyou could get it into the culture that there were other ways of dealing with this.   \n 14\n \nF: No it hasn\u2019t changed anything for me.  I\u2019d sad for them but it hasn\u2019t \nchanged anything for me. \n \nG: You can be sympathetic for all of it can\u2019t you, but you can\u2019t change the \nground rules. \n \nH: Yes. \n \n \nReasoning in lay and professional bioethical discourse \nMuch of the bioethical discussion found in literature and in policy documents displays \ncharacteristic features of Anglo-American philosophy. It uses arguments that proceed \nin a step by step logical fashion and are consistent, coherent and not self-\ncontradictory; it aims at objectivity; draws on recognisable theories (such as rights, \nutilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics) to organise the argument; uses devices such \nas examples, analogies, and statements of ethical principles or rules in the justificatory \nprocess; and generally comes to a conclusion. How do the lay participants\u2019 \ndiscussions compare? \n \nDevices and resources \nSome philosophical devices were easily recognisable in these discussions, such as the \nslippery slope argument, analogy, examples and (implicit) expressions of principle. \nThis is not unexpected: as Gibbard (1990, 4) comments, philosophical arguments \n\u2018start from the materials of common thought and speech, and refine them.\u2019 But there \nwere also some important differences. Unlike moral  philosophers writing about \nbioethics, the discussion group participants rarely made explicit statements of \nprinciple or rule, and never, as far as we could tell, worked from a conscious \ncommitment to an ethical theory to the conclusion generated by that commitment. \nFurther, the primary material for their deliberations was their own experience, rather \nthan the steps of logical argument.  \n \n 15\nReason\/rationality \nRationalist approaches to moral psychology suggest that ethical judgements are best \nreached through reasoning and rational reflection ( Kohlberg, 1969; Turiel, 1983). \nThis perspective connects \u2018ordinary\u2019 ethical judgements to the thinking of \nprofessional ethicists through the capacity for rational argumentation: the more \nrational the judgement, the more like \u2018real\u2019 ethics it is. \n \nReasoning, rationality, and the relationship between the two have increasingly \ninterested not just philosophers but also moral psychologists and cognitive scientists.  \nPerhaps the most widely accepted definition of rationality is what Stein (1996, 4) \ncalled the Standard Picture: \u2018to be rational is to reason in accordance with principles \nof reasoning that are based on rules of logic, probability theory and so on\u2019. However, \nexperimental psychology has convincingly shown that in real life, people\u2019s reasoning \nand decision making systematically break the rules of rationality (for example, \nTversky and Kahneman, 1986).  So on these empirical grounds, we would not expect \nto find our participants using purely rational reasoning. \n \nWhat we do find are forms of reasoning that lie outside this definition of rationality. A \nbroader concept of reasoning includes \u2018our ability to conduct inquiry, to solve \nproblems, to evaluate, to criticize, to deliberate about how we should act, and to reach \nan understanding of ourselves, other people, and the world\u2019 (Lakoff and Johnson \n1999, 3-4; see also Toulmin, 2001).  Using this definition we can say that participants \ndid not use purely rational resoning, but they did reason. \n \nCoherence \nSeveral authors have considered the process of everyday ethical inquiry and \ndistinguished between spontaneous moral judgements and deliberative ethical \ntheorizing (Davidson and Youniss, 1991, 1995; Colby, 2000).  Spontaneous moral \njudgements or intuitions are the instinctive or \u2018gut\u2019 reactions of our participants that \nwe elicited by asking for their first reactions to the scenario. They are enabled through \nimplicit cognitive-moral schemes of interpretation that are not conscious or rational \nbut which have been internalized through being part of particular social contexts. The \nmore reflective or deliberative process is less common, since it is normally only \nneeded when the right course of action is not obvious \u2013 for example, when a novel \n 16\nsituation presents itself, or when a person\u2019s ethical intuition is challenged. But as \nHaidt (2001) notes, both moral intuition and ethical reasoning are forms of (moral) \ncognition.  \nIn everyday contexts \u2013 and especially where the moral issue is culturally familiar \u2013 \njustification is generally not necessary. This is very unlike the process of doing \nprofessional bioethics, where justification is always necessary.  \n \nAlthough our discussions began by evoking people\u2019s instinctive or gut reaction to the \nquestion, it was also the case that they referred back to it throughout the discussion, \nchecking out the coherence of their starting intuition with the conclusions they were \ncoming to using reasoning, examples and analogies. Although we are unable to \ndiscuss this fully here, this has some parallels with the method of ethical deliberation \nknown as wide reflective equilibrium (Rawls, 1999). According to Rawls (1999, 19): \n\u2018Justification is a matter of the mutual support of many considerations, of everything \nfitting together into one coherent view\u2019, in contrast to justification by reference to a \nsingle principle or theory.  The method tries to produce coherence between considered \nmoral judgements or intuitions, moral principles, and relevant background theories; \nthe lay person\u2019s components might differ, but the process of working to and fro \nbetween them with the aim of producing an acceptable coherence appears similar. \n \nWe conclude that the lay people in our discussion groups noted the complexities of \nthe issues (often developed through turns in conversation and a process of co-\nexploration) and used a range of resources for presenting arguments. The process was \nnot as refined as that found in the moral philosophy literature, but the basic \ningredients were there.  (1) Lay people do use reasoning, although they draw on other \nforms of reasoning than propositional logic; (2) they use the normative resources \navailable to them, predominantly personal experience and examples rather than \ntheories or principles; (3) they make extensive use of analogies, examples, and \u2018what \nif?\u2019 thought experiments, and in this respect use resources familiar to philosophers; \nand (4) their deliberations adhere less consistently to a particular ethical theory or \napproach than that of philosophers, but they strive to achieve coherence between their \nintuitions, normative values and principles (even if unarticulated), and their reasoning. \n \nImplications for public engagement \n 17\nNoting the extensive use made of analogies suggests one way of facilitating public \ndiscourse may be to provide better\/different analogies. Is PSS more like adoption (the \nethically relevant feature is that it enables parents to satisfy their deepest desires about \nhaving children) or more like choosing what kind of cereal to buy (in that it involves \nthe expression of preferences)? Even formal casuistry is unable to give much \nguidance about choosing between competing analogies (Jonsen and Toulmin, 1988). \nCasuistry also recognises that no analogy can be a perfect fit in terms of salient \nfeatures, and failure to notice dis-analogies can lead to the wrong ethical conclusion.  \nUsing the parallel with adoption, for example, de-prioritises what some would \nconsider a relevant difference, that in one case (adoption) the children already exist, \nand in the other (PSS) they do not. \n \nAnother point is access to useful ethical language. Tappan has written about the role \nin moral functioning of the \u2018vernacular moral language\u2019 (Tappan, 1997, 85), and \nargues along with others (for example, Wertsch, 1989, 1991) that the verbal and \ncognitive tools available for ethical thinking reflect particular institutional, cultural \nand historical forces.  Here the ethical reasoning of individual reflection and dialogue \nwould be enhanced by careful attention to the language in which the problem is \npresented and to the ethical tools that are made available via professional and media \ndiscourses. \n \nThe issues that lay people find important, and the ways they express and develop their \nopinions and arguments, constitute an important dimension in policy decisions about \nthe use of new genetic technologies. The richness of this lay contribution is best \ncaptured not by opinion surveys, which are particularly vulnerable to the critique \noffered by Harris cited earlier, but rather by deliberative processes that take place in \ngroups \u2013 for example, focus groups, citizen\u2019s juries or Socratic dialogue. Such \ndeliberations can generate a sophisticated dialogue that goes beyond mere \nunreflecting prejudice and adds texture to often abstract and principle-based \nphilosophical debates. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n 18\nWe are grateful to the Wellcome Trust for funding this project, the participants in the \ndiscussion groups for allowing us to use their anonymised conversations and to two \nanonymous referees for helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.   \n \n \nAppendix: Details of discussion groups \n \n1.
