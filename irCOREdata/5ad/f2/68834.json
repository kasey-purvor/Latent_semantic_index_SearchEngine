N2 rotational temperature was measured with a rocket-borne instrument launched from the And\u00f8ya Rocket Range, neutral winds were measured from auroral emissions at 557.7 nm with a Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) at Skibotn and the KEOPS, and ionospheric parameters were measured with the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar at Troms\u00f8. Altitude profiles of the passive energy deposition rate and the particle heating rate were estimated using data taken with the EISCAT radar. The local temperature enhancement derived from the difference between the observed N2 rotational temperature and the MSISE-90 model neutral temperature were 70\u2013140 K at 110\u2013140 km altitude.

Introduction\n[2] Auroral energy deposition in the polar lower thermo-\nsphere enhances the neutral temperature directly through\nJoule and particle heating. An upwelling of heated air is\ndriven by a sudden rise in local temperature and thus\nvertical winds are generated by intense heating occurring\nduring geomagnetically disturbed conditions [Smith, 1998].\nLarge vertical winds in the lower and upper thermosphere\nassociated with auroral disturbances have been observed by\nground-based Fabry-Perot Interferometers (FPIs) since the\n1980s [Rees et al., 1984; Wardill and Jacka, 1986; Price\nand Jacka, 1991; Price et al., 1995; Smith and Hernandez,\n1995]. Price et al. [1995] measured vertical winds and\ntemperature with a FPI using auroral emissions from atomic\noxygen at the wavelengths of 557.7 and 630.0 nm\ncorresponding to the effective emission altitudes of the\nlower and upper thermosphere, respectively. The observa-\ntions showed that a large upwelling occurred simultaneously\nin both altitudes during geomagnetically active conditions\nand the vertical wind speeds reached 42 m s\u00021 in the lower\nthermosphere and 138 m s\u00021 in the upper thermosphere.\nWith the large vertical winds, large temperature enhance-\nments of about 200 K in the lower thermosphere were also\nobserved. However, recent FPI observations show that a\ncorrelation between the vertical winds in the lower and\nupper atmosphere does not always exist [Ishii et al., 1999,\n2001, 2004; Kosch et al., 2000] and that an apparently\ninverse relationship between the estimated temperature\nand auroral intensity is explained by the tendency of the\n557.7 nm emission to come from lower heights during bright\naurora [Ishii et al., 2001; Holmes et al., 2005]. Although\nFPIs are valuable tools for simultaneously measuring neu-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, A12306, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014392, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory, Nagoya University, Nagoya,\nJapan.\n2National Institute of Polar Research, Research Organization of\nInformation and Systems, Tokyo, Japan.\n3Department of Earth and Planetary Science, Graduate School of\nScience, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.\n4Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan Aerospace\nExploration Agency, Sagamihara, Japan.\n5Plasma and Space Science Center, National Cheng Kung University,\nTainan, Taiwan.\n6Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.\n7Atmospheric Physics Laboratory, University College London, London,\nUK.\n8Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, Finland.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2009JA014392$09.00\nA12306 1 of 13\ntral wind and temperature, it is difficult for an FPI alone\nto interpret the connection between vertical winds and\ntemperature enhancements and to identify the source of\nlarge vertical winds [Wescott et al., 2006].\n[3] In contrast to the FPI observations, only a few studies\nhave attempted vertical wind observations by incoherent\nscatter (IS) radars in the polar lower thermosphere [Kofman\net al., 1996; Oyama et al., 2005, 2008]. The greatest\nadvantage of the IS radar observation in this research issue\nis that auroral energy deposition can be estimated by the\nmeasurements of ionospheric parameters. Oyama et al.\n[2008] measured the vertical neutral wind speed in the\nlower thermosphere using the European Incoherent Scatter\n(EISCAT) UHF radar and showed that large upward winds\nexisted in excess of 30 m s\u00021 in association with an auroral\nheating event.\n[4] Modeling studies suggest that large vertical winds\ndriven by local heating in the lower thermosphere have a\nsignificant impact on the dynamical and compositional\nstates up to the upper thermosphere [Walterscheid et al.,\n1985; Walterscheid and Lyons, 1992; Sun et al., 1995;\nShinagawa et al., 2003; Shinagawa and Oyama, 2006].\nThese regional-scale models, which have the horizontal\nscale of 100\u201310,000 km, employ nonhydrostatic simula-\ntions to reproduce large vertical winds. Russell et al. [2007]\nindicated that large vertical winds can transport significant\namount of molecular nitrogen and oxygen upwards,\nsuggesting that many satellite-borne mass spectrometer\nmeasurements may overestimate the concentrations of\natomic oxygen during disturbed conditions. Since the non-\nhydrostatic effects are not included in general circulation\nmodels (GCMs), previous GCMs have not been able to\nreproduce the observed large vertical winds and may have\npotentially underestimated the upward transport of molecular\nspecies [Smith, 2000]. More recently, a global-scale non-\nhydrostatic model was developed [Deng and Ridley, 2006a]\nand the results indicated that the high-latitude Joule heating\ndrives large upward winds of the observed magnitude from\nthe lower altitude source region to higher altitudes [Deng and\nRidley, 2006b; Deng et al., 2008].\n[5] The Dynamics and Energetics of the Lower Thermo-\nsphere in Aurora (DELTA) campaign was carried out in\nDecember 2004, in order to make a coordinated observation\nof the thermospheric response against the auroral energy\ninput using a sounding rocket, FPIs, the EISCAT UHF\nradar, and other ground-based instruments such as all-sky\ncameras (ASCs) and magnetometers. Figure 1 shows a\nschematic diagram of the coordinated observation. A\nmulti-instrument investigation of temperature enhancements\nand vertical winds in the lower thermosphere was one of the\nmain objectives of the DELTA campaign. The preliminary\nresults and detailed description of each instrument have\nalready been published in ten papers as a special issue of\nEarth, Planets and Space [see the introduction paper by Abe\net al., 2006]. The vertical profile of neutral temperature in\nthe lower thermosphere was obtained by the sounding\nrocket experiment [Kurihara et al., 2006], time variations\nof neutral temperature and winds at the auroral emission\naltitudes were measured with two FPIs at Skibotn and at the\nKEOPS (Kiruna Esrange Optical Platform Site) [Griffin et\nal., 2006], and the altitude and temporal profiles of iono-\nspheric parameters and neutral winds were observed by the\nFigure 1.

Although these\nstudies have made comparisons with the observational\nresults of other instruments, a comprehensive study focused\non temperature enhancements and vertical winds in the\ncontext of auroral heating has not been reported for the\nDELTA campaign. Since it is very difficult to obtain\nan altitude profile of neutral temperature in the lower\nthermosphere, these data sets provide more unique and\nvaluable information than ever before. In the present paper,\npossible causes of temperature enhancements and vertical\nwinds observed with the rocket-borne instrument and the\nSkibotn FPI in the lower thermosphere during the DELTA\ncampaign are discussed by estimating auroral heating rates\nquantitatively using data taken with the EISCAT UHF radar.\n2. Observations\n2.1. In Situ Temperature Observation\n[6] During the DELTA campaign, a Japanese sounding\nrocket S-310-35 was launched from the And\u00f8ya Rocket\nRange (69.3\u0002N, 16.0\u0002E geographic coordinates) in Norway,\nat 00:33 UT, 13 December 2004, under geomagnetically\ndisturbed conditions when the three hourly geomagnetic Kp\nindex was 4+ for 00:00\u201303:00 UT. The And\u00f8ya Rocket\nRange is located at 67.4\u0002N, 113.4\u0002E geomagnetic coordi-\nnates and the Magnetic Local Time (MLT) is given by UT +\n2.5 hours. A total of eight scientific instruments on the\nrocket carried out successful measurements [Abe et al.,\n2006]. Rotational temperature and number density of atmo-\nspheric molecular nitrogen (N2) were observed with the N2\nTemperature of Vibration (NTV) instrument installed on the\nrocket [Kurihara et al., 2006]. The instrument used the\nElectron Beam Fluorescence (EBF) technique and consisted\nof an electron gun to excite and ionize the ambient N2 and a\nspectrometer to detect the fluorescence of the N2\n+ first\nnegative (1N) system. The N2 rotational temperature was\ndetermined by fitting a synthetic spectrum to the measured\nspectrum of the N2\n+ 1N (0, 0) band at 391.4 nm and the\nnumber density was calculated from the intensity of the\nband [Kurihara and Oyama, 2005].\n[7] The sounding rocket flew geographically northward\nfrom And\u00f8ya and reached an apogee of 140.0 km at 184 s\nfrom the launch. The N2 rotational temperature and number\ndensity measurements by the NTV were conducted at 97\u2013\n140 km altitude during the ascent of the rocket flight and\n140\u201395 km during the descent. The rotational temperature\nof N2 is expected to be equal to the neutral temperature in\nthe lower thermosphere, because the equilibrium between\nrotational and translational degrees of freedom for N2 is\nimmediately established by the high collision frequency of\nthe lower thermosphere. The relaxation time for attaining\nthe equilibrium is \u000310\u00023 s at 95 km altitude and \u000310\u00021 s at\n140 km [Kurihara et al., 2006]. Such a short relaxation time\nensures that N2 rotational temperature can be used as a\nproxy of neutral temperature even during an auroral heating\nevent in the polar lower thermosphere. However, below\n110 km, the rotational temperature measured by the NTV\nmight not be equal to the ambient neutral temperature\nbecause of the aerodynamic effects around the rocket at\nsupersonic speed. Since the measurement volume of the\nNTV was located in the vicinity of the payload, N2\nmolecules passing through the shock front could enter the\nmeasurement volume. If the travel time from the shock front\nto the measurement volume was longer than the relaxation\ntime, the measured rotational temperature could be higher\nthan the ambient atmospheric temperature. Kurihara et al.\n[2006] has demonstrated that the rotational temperature\nmeasurement was free from the aerodynamic effects above\n110 km, as expected theoretically. It should also be noted\nthat horizontal distance between the ascent and the descent\nvaried with altitude owing to the rocket trajectory. The\nhorizontal distances were 40, 33, and 22 km at 110, 120,\nand 130 km altitudes, respectively.\n[8] Figure 2a shows altitude profiles of the observed N2\nrotational temperature during the ascent and descent of the\nrocket flight. The observed rotational temperatures in the\nascent and descent agree well above 110 km. Below that\naltitude, rotational temperature measurements were affected\nby the aerodynamic effects and are not plotted here to avoid\nconfusion.\n[9] The difference between the observed N2 rotational\ntemperature and the neutral temperature predicted by the\nMass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter (MSISE-90) model\n[Hedin, 1991] is 70\u2013140 K as shown in Figure 2b. Since\nthe empirical MSIS model uses a planetary geomagnetic\nindex Ap as an input parameter, the MSIS model value\nintrinsically represents the mean state of the upper atmo-\nsphere for the global-scale geomagnetic activity. Figure 2a\nalso shows the MSIS model neutral temperature calculated\nusing the variation of three hourly geomagnetic index ap\nduring the previous 48 hours, instead of daily index Ap. The\nneutral temperature profile derived using the ap variation is\nslightly higher than that using the daily Ap but much lower\nthan the observed N2 rotational temperature.\n[10] In addition, the ion temperature observed by the\nEISCAT UHF radar about two hours before the rocket\nlaunch is shown in Figure 2a and the difference between\nthe ion temperature and the MSIS model temperature is\nplotted in Figure 2b. The ion temperature at each altitude is\naveraged temporally for 22:30\u201323:00 UT and spatially for\nfour sampling positions. As shown in the next section, the\nEISCAT UHF radar and magnetometer observations\nindicate that ionospheric condition was geomagnetically\nquiet during 22:20\u201323:20 UT. The ion temperature in the\nlower ionosphere is expected to be close to the neutral\ntemperature during such quiet conditions. The observed ion\ntemperature is higher than the MSIS model neutral temper-\nature above 110 km but lower than the observed N2\nrotational temperature.\n[11] Therefore, it is considered that the temperature\ndifference between the observed N2 rotational temperature\nand the MSIS model neutral temperature or the EISCAT\nquiet time ion temperature is a temperature enhancement\ncaused by the local heating. The validity of the N2 rotational\ntemperature measurement has already been discussed by\nKurihara et al. [2006] and the assumption of local heating\nis a subject of discussion in the present study.\n2.2. EISCAT UHF Radar Observation\n[12] The EISCAT UHF radar observations at Troms\u00f8\n(69.6\u0002N, 19.2\u0002E geographic coordinates; 67.1\u0002N, 116.4\u0002E\ngeomagnetic coordinates) in Norway were conducted on 5\nand 8\u201313 December 2004 during the DELTA campaign\n[Nozawa et al., 2006]. In most of the observations, the\nA12306 KURIHARA ET AL.: DELTA CAMPAIGN\n3 of 13\nA12306\nEISCAT UHF radar was operated in a Common Program 2\n(CP2) mode in which the line of sight of the combined\ntransmitter and receiver antenna was pointed to four con-\nsecutive directions, including one field aligned position,\nwith a dwell time of \u00031 min in each position, making a full\ncycle time of 6 min. In addition to the electron density,\nelectron temperature, and ion temperature, which are\nderived from each position, the three-dimensional ion\nvelocity vectors are derived every 6 min by combining three\nsets of line-of-sight velocities from \u000390 km to \u0003500 km\naltitude. From these ion velocity vectors, the electric field\nvectors can be derived assuming that the F region plasma\ndrifts perpendicular to the geomagnetic field are solely due\nto the electric field. The electric field E is then obtained by\nE \u00bc \u0002 v\u0004 B\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere v is the ion velocity at 282 km and B is the\ngeomagnetic field derived from the International Geomag-\nnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model.\n[13] The EISCAT UHF radar observation at Troms\u00f8\nsuggests the presence of a strong auroral heating asso-\nciated with the geomagnetic disturbance around the time\nof the rocket launch. Figure 3 summarizes the time varia-\ntion of parameters observed by the EISCAT UHF radar\nand a ground-based magnetometer at Troms\u00f8. Figure 3a\nshows the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field\n(H component) observed by the magnetometer. The H compo-\nnent immediately decreased by 200 nT in the interval of\n00:00\u201300:10 UT, about half an hour prior to the rocket\nlaunch at 00:33 UT and two hours after a sudden southward\nturning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)-Bz com-\nponent recorded by the ACE spacecraft at 22:07 UT [Abe et\nal., 2006]. Data from ground-based magnetometers in the\nIMAGE (International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic\nEffects) network suggest that the horizontal ionospheric\ncurrent was flowing westward for the time interval from\n00:00 to 03:30 UT over a meridionally wide region includ-\ning S\u00f8r\u00f8ya (70.5\u0002N, 22.2\u0002E) and Pello (66.9\u0002N, 24.1\u0002E).\nFigure 3b indicates the meridional and zonal components of\nthe electric field strength observed by the EISCAT UHF\nradar. The southward electric field at 50 mV m\u00021 lasted for\nan hour before the rocket launch. Figures 3c and 3d show\nthe height variation of the electron density and ion temper-\nature in the E region, respectively. The electron density was\nvery low from 23:40 to 00:10 UT due to evacuation of the\nionospheric electrons in association with the downward\nfield-aligned current. After 00:10 UT the electron density\nwas enhanced by the precipitation up to \u00031011 m\u00023 all over\nthe E region. The enhancement of the electron density\nraised the ionospheric conductivity. The ion temperature\nabove 120 km increased several hundred K in response to\nthe large increase in the electric field. The enhancement of\nthe electric field coupled with the enhancement of the\nionospheric conductivity enhances Joule heating in the\nlower thermosphere.\n[14] Nozawa et al. [2006] derived neutral temperature\nfrom the ion temperature observed with the EISCAT UHF\nradar at the field-aligned direction from 00:35:15 to\n00:36:00 UT, a time interval during the ascent of the rocket\nflight. The derived neutral temperature showed reasonable\nagreement with the observed rotational temperature but\nbetter agreement with the MSIS neutral temperature. The\ncause of these results is mainly attributable to variability of\nthe observed ion temperature. As shown in Figure 3d, the\nFigure 2. Altitude profiles of (a) the N2 rotational temperature observed by the NTV instrument during\nthe ascent (red) and descent (blue) of the rocket flight, compared with the neutral temperature from the\nMSISE-90 model (black) and the ion temperature observed by the EISCAT UHF radar two hours before\nthe rocket launch (green), and (b) temperature differences between the MSISE-90 model and the N2\nrotational temperature during the ascent (red), the MSISE-90 model and the N2 rotational temperature\nduring the descent (blue), and the MSISE-90 model and the EISCAT ion temperature (green). The dotted\nline indicates the MSIS-E-90 model neutral temperature using three hourly index ap variation, instead of\ndaily index Ap.\nA12306 KURIHARA ET AL.: DELTA CAMPAIGN\n4 of 13\nA12306\nobserved ion temperature was highly variable and the ion\ntemperature at 00:35:15\u201300:36:00 UT was relatively low\ncompared with the other observation periods around the\nrocket flight. For example, the ion temperature at 114 km\nvaried from 400 to 900 K during 10 minutes between 00:30\nand 00:40 UT. Such large variation of the ion temperature\ndata in this period was also shown by Griffin et al. [2006].\nAs pointed out by Nozawa et al. [2006], the considerable\nvariation in the ion temperature would be caused by\nvariation in the electric field associated with moving auroral\nstructures. Note that the electric field in Figure 3b was not\nas variable as the ion temperature because the electric field\nwas deduced from a six minute cycle of the ion velocity\nmeasurements.\n2.3. Ground-Based Optical Observations\n[15] For the DELTA campaign, the FPIs at Skibotn\n(69.3\u0002N, 20.4\u0002E) in Norway and at the KEOPS (67.8\u0002N,\n21.0\u0002E) in Sweden sampled the 557.7 nm green line\nemission and provided neutral temperatures and line-of-\nsight wind velocities [Griffin et al., 2006]. Both the FPIs\nscanned in the zenith and the four cardinal directions, the\nKEOPS FPI also scanned in the northwestward direction.\nThe Skibotn FPI used an integration time of 10 s for each\ndirection resulting in a cycle time of about 7 min 20 s and\nthe KEOPS FPI took an integration time of 30 s resulting in\na cycle time of 8 min. Since FPIs are passive optical\ninstruments, the observed neutral temperature and wind\nspeed are intensity-weighted mean values along the line of\nsight and thus approximately equal to the values at the peak\nemission altitude.\n[16] Griffin et al. [2006] found an apparent wind diver-\ngence and upward vertical winds from the green line\nobservation by the FPI at Skibotn around the time of the\nrocket launch. There was the apparent divergence in the\nline-of-sight velocities in the cardinal directions around\n00:00\u201301:00 UT, showing opposite velocities in the north-\nward and southward directions and also in the eastward and\nwestward directions. The \u2018\u2018apparent divergence\u2019\u2019 may be\ncaused by the failure of the standard assumption that the\nline-of-sight neutral wind velocity consists of only a hori-\nzontal component, or caused by the presence of cloud\nscatter. The all-sky camera shows clear skies during the\nrocket launch, thus it is likely that there was a significant\nvertical wind component distorting the FPI analysis.\n[17] Figure 4a shows vertical wind speeds measured in\nthe zenith direction of the Skibotn FPI. At Skibotn cloudy\nconditions were observed until 21:36 UT, which generally\nrender the wind observations from the FPIs based on\nDoppler shifts unreliable. Some measurements in the clear\nconditions after 21:36 UT were also slightly inaccurate\nmainly due to the low intensity of the green line emission.\nExcept for the periods of unreliable measurements before\n21:36 UT and less accurate measurements with large error\nbars, significantly upward vertical winds up to 40 m s\u00021\nwere observed around 22:00 UT and 00:00\u201301:00 UT. A\nwind speed of 40 m s\u00021 is unusually large for a vertical\nwind in the lower thermosphere and such large vertical\nwinds have been observed only under highly disturbed\nconditions even in the auroral region [see Smith, 1998,\nand references therein]. On the other hand, significantly\ndownward vertical winds in excess of 20 m s\u00021 were\nFigure 3.

The zero baselines of the\nvertical wind speed are usually determined by assuming that\nthe long term average vertical wind is zero and a systematic\nerror in excess of 10 m s\u00021 may occur in geomagnetically\ndisturbed conditions [Aruliah and Rees, 1995]. Although\nthis means that the zero vertical wind baseline used in the\nSkibotn FPI observation could suffer the same problem, the\nvertical wind observations in the 00:00\u201301:00 UT and\n22:50\u201323:30 UT periods demonstrated the most positive\nand negative wind speeds in that night, respectively [Griffin\net al., 2006]. Figure 4b shows vertical wind speeds mea-\nsured with the KEOPS FPI. At the KEOPS site clear\nconditions were observed throughout the night. Since the\nintensities of the green line emission measured in the zenith\ndirection of the KEOPS FPI were lower than those of the\nSkibotn FPI in the 22:30\u201303:00 UT period, the measure-\nment errors for the vertical wind speed were relatively large\nfor the KEOPS. The KEOPS vertical wind speeds showed\nlittle variation and were around 10 m s\u00021 downward during\nthe 00:00\u201301:00 UT period. This indicates that the large\nupward winds seen by the Skibotn FPI are very localized.\nThe localized nature of upward vertical winds is important\nbecause hydrostatic equilibrium cannot support large verti-\ncal winds over hundreds of kilometers distance, which is\nwhy the standard GCMs do not show large vertical winds.\n[18] The ground-based ASCs have observed intense\nauroral emissions for over 30 minutes around the rocket\nflight. During the flight, vortical auroral structures elongated\nin the east-west directions were propagating eastward with a\nspeed of 2\u20133 km s\u00021 over the region between 68 and 70\u0002N\n[see Kurihara et al., 2006, Figure 1]. Figure 5 shows the\ngreen line emissions observed by the ASC at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\n(69.0\u0002N, 20.9\u0002E), a site of the Magnetometers-Ionospheric\nRadars-All-sky Cameras Large Experiment (MIRACLE)\nnetwork. Kurihara et al. [2006] determined the effective\naltitude of auroral structures during the rocket flight by\ncombining two ASC images at 557.7 nm obtained from\ntwo separate stations, Kilpisja\u00a8rvi and Muonio (68.0\u0002N,\n23.5\u0002E). The resultant peak altitude of green line emission\nwas about 120 km. They found that the neutral temperature of\nabout 500 K from the FPI 557.7 nm measurements was\nconsistent with the observed N2 rotational temperature at\n120 km altitude rather than the MSIS model value at that\naltitude. This agreement also supports the validity of the\nrotational temperature measurement.\n3. Auroral Heating Rate Estimation\n[19] In order to investigate the relationship between\nauroral energy inputs, temperature enhancements, and the\nvertical winds, auroral heating rates are estimated using\ndata taken with the EISCAT observations. The Joule\nheating induced by ionospheric current J and the particle\nheating deposited by precipitating electrons have direct heat-\ning effects on the neutral atmosphere.\n[20] The Joule heating rate qJ = J \u0005 E0 can be expressed as\n[Brekke, 1997; Fujii et al., 1999]\nJ \u0005 E0 \u00bc sP E0\u00f0 \u00de2\u00bc sP E\u00fe U\u0004 B\u00f0 \u00de2; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere sP is the Pedersen conductivity, U is the neutral wind\nvelocity, and E0 is the electric field in the reference frame of\nthe neutral wind. If the electric field strength is sufficiently\nlarge and the neutral wind speed is negligibly small, the\nJoule heating rate can be approximated by the passive\nenergy deposition rate, qJ\nE = sPE\n2. The present study uses\nthe passive energy deposition rate as an indicator of the\nJoule heating rate for simplicity. The inclusion of the neutral\nwind dynamo is discussed later. The Pedersen conductivity\ncan be expressed as [Brekke and Hall, 1988; Brekke, 1997]\nsP \u00bc Nee\nB\nWenen\nWe2 \u00fe nen2\n\u00fe Winin\nWi2 \u00fe nin2\n\u0002 \u0003\n; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere Ne is the electron density, e is the electron charge, We\nand Wi are the electron and ion gyrofrequencies, respec-\ntively, and nen and nin are the electron-neutral and ion-\nFigure 4.

These parameters\nneeded for calculation of the Pedersen conductivity are\nderived from the EISCAT observation and the MSISE-90\nmodel. The Pedersen conductivity is integrated from 100 to\n300 km to derive the height-integrated passive energy\ndeposition rate, QJ\nE =\nR\nqJ\nEdh = E2\nR\nsPdh.\n[21] The particle heating rate qp can be written as [Vickrey\net al., 1982]\nqp \u00bc \u0002aeff Ne2; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere \u0002 is the energy per ion-electron pair, which is\ndeposited in the atmosphere as heat, and aeff is the effective\nrecombination coefficient. It is assumed that the ionization\nrate is equal to the recombination rate, aeffNe\n2. The effective\nrecombination coefficient (m3 s\u00021) is given as a function of\nheight h (km) above 85 km by\naeff \u00bc 2:5\u0004 10\u000212 exp \u0002 h\n51:2\n\u0002 \u0003\n; \u00f05\u00de\nbased on the various measurements [Vickrey et al., 1982].\nThe particle heating rate is calculated on the assumptions\nFigure 5.

The sounding rocket (open red circle) launched from\nAndya Rocket Range (solid red circle) was at an altitude of 120 km during the ascent of the flight. The\nsampling positions of the EISCAT UHF radar at Troms\u00f8 (blue diamonds), the Skibotn FPI (yellow\ntriangles), and the KEOPS FPI (yellow boxes) are mapped to 110 km altitude, expressing their zenith\npositions in solid symbols.\nA12306 KURIHARA ET AL.: DELTA CAMPAIGN\n7 of 13\nA12306\nthat (1) steady state conditions hold during the data\nintegration period, (2) ion transport can be ignored (h <\n160 km), (3) no source of ionization exists other than\nparticle precipitation, and (4) \u0002 = 35 eV are expended per\nion-electron pair. The height-integrated particle heating rate,\nQp =\nR\nqpdh, is integrated from 95 to 160 km.\n[22] Figures 6a and 6b illustrate the time variations of qJ\nE\nand qp, respectively, per unit volume (mW m\n\u00023) between\n100 and 150 km and Figure 6c shows the time variations of\nQJ\nE and Qp per unit area (mW m\n\u00022). Excluding the interval\nof 21:50\u201322:10 UT, QJ\nE and Qp were very small until 00:00\nUT. QJ\nE increased from 00:00 UT, 33 minutes before the\nrocket launch, because of the enhancements both in the\nelectric field strength and the electron density. Although\nthe electric field magnitudes up to 50 mV m\u00021 from 23:20\nto 00:00 UT were similar to those from 00:00 to 00:40 UT\nas shown in Figure 3b, QJ\nE from 23:20 to 00:00 UT were\nmuch smaller than those from 00:00 to 00:40 UT due to the\nlow electron density in the E region. QJ\nE was relatively\nsteady until 00:40 UT and continued intermittently for hours\nafter that. The altitude profile of qJ\nE, which depends on the\nPedersen conductivity, shows a peak around 120 km. Qp\nalso increased from 00:00 UT with the enhancement in the\nelectron density. While Qp was mostly lower than QJ\nE until\n00:30 UT, they were comparable during the rocket flight.\nThe peak altitude of qp was 115\u2013120 km around the period\nof the rocket launch and 105\u2013110 km after 01:00 UT.\nIwagami et al. [2006] estimated the characteristic energy\nof the precipitating auroral electrons during the rocket flight\nto be 4 keV, by comparing the observed peak altitude of the\ngreen line emission [Kurihara et al., 2006] with the\ncalculated green line volume emission rate for unit incident\nflux [Banks et al., 1974]. The peak altitudes of qp during the\nrocket flight are consistent with the calculated ionization\nrate for the characteristic energy of 4 keV that peaks around\n120 km [Banks et al., 1974].\n[23] Since the first presentation by Brekke and Rino\n[1978] regarding the altitude profiles of the Joule heating\nrate with the observed E region neutral winds, the influence\nof the neutral wind on the electromagnetic energy deposi-\ntion in the polar lower thermosphere has been examined in a\nnumber of studies using IS radar observations [Fujii et al.,\n1998, 1999; Thayer, 1998a, 1998b, 2000; Fujiwara et al.,\n2004]. The use of the passive energy deposition rate as an\nindicator of the Joule heating rate is valid if the neutral wind\neffect U \u0004 B is negligible compared with the electric field E\nin Equation (2). Although the E region neutral wind data\nderived by the EISCAT UHF radar is available in this\ncampaign, the data shows rapid and scattered temporal\nvariations during 21:00\u201302:00 UT and needs careful treat-\nment [Nozawa et al., 2006]. The temporal variations of the\nneutral wind is possibly caused by temporal variations of\nthe electric field, which also affected the temporal variations\nof the ion temperature as already mentioned in Section 2.2.\nMeanwhile, the FPI wind measurements show horizontal\nneutral winds less than 100 m s\u00021 [Griffin et al., 2006]. This\nhorizontal wind data, which were derived assuming no\nvertical component in the line-of-sight velocities, provide\nupper limits for horizontal wind speeds at the effective\naltitudes of the 557.7 nm emission. Assuming that jUj is\nFigure 6. Time variations of the auroral heating rates observed by the EISCAT UHF radar, showing\n(a) the passive energy deposition rate, (b) the particle heating rate, and (c) their height-integrated values.\n(d) The same as Figure 4a, but the unreliable measurements due to the cloudy conditions before 21:36 UT\nand the less accurate measurements with error bars larger than 20 m s\u00021 are represented in gray and the\nother in red.\nA12306 KURIHARA ET AL.: DELTA CAMPAIGN\n8 of 13\nA12306\n100 m s\u00021 and B is perpendicular to U, the maximum\nmagnitude of the neutral wind induced electric field jU \u0004 Bj\nis estimated to be \u00034.5 mV m\u00021. Therefore the contribution\nof the neutral wind to the Joule heating rate is less than\n\u000310% during the interval of 00:00\u201300:30 UT when the\nstrong electric field of 50 mV m\u00021 level was observed.\n[24] Another source of ambiguity in the auroral heating\nrate estimation is the neutral density. The particle heating\nrate estimation depends on the ion density and not on the\nneutral density; but the Joule heating rate and the passive\nenergy deposition rate depends on the neutral number\ndensity through nen and nin in the calculation of sP. The\ninfluence of the neutral density on the Joule and passive\nenergy deposition rates are significant below about 120 km,\nwhere nin is larger than Wi, and the Joule and passive energy\ndeposition rates are almost in inverse proportion to the\nneutral number density below 110 km. Since nin is calcu-\nlated using the neutral number density from the MSISE-90\nmodel, the derived auroral heating rate below 120 km is\nunderestimated (overestimated) if the local neutral density is\nlower (higher) than the MSISE-90 model value.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Vertical Winds\n[25] From Figure 6, it becomes clear that the positive\nvertical wind speed is associated with the estimated auroral\nheating rates. In addition, the time response of the upward\nvertical wind to the auroral heating seems to be very fast\nand at least comparable to the time interval between vertical\nwind measurements, judging from the onset of the auroral\nheating event around 22:00 and 00:00 UT and the variation\nwith timescale of less than about 15 minutes in the interval\nof 00:00\u201302:00 UT. The upward vertical winds around\n22:00 UT and during 00:00\u201302:00 UT seem to respond to\nthe increase of QJ\nE rather than that of Qp owing to a\nrelatively larger contribution of QJ\nE to the total heating rate.\n[26] In order to more clearly show a relationship between\nthe vertical wind speed and the heating rate in Figure 6, the\ndata smoothed using a three point running average during\n21:00\u201303:00 UT are shown in Figure 7. The vertical wind\ndata for the cloudy condition before 21:36 UT are not used\nfor smoothing, and the height-integrated heating rate is the\nsum of QJ\nE and Qp. There seems to be a positive relationship\nbetween the vertical wind speed and the height-integrated\nheating rate and an almost instantaneous response of the\nvertical wind speed to the height-integrated heating rate in\nthis timescale. It should be mentioned, however, that a peak\nof vertical wind speed at 00:26 UT precedes a peak of the\nheight-integrated heating rate by 30 minutes. This deviation\nis possibly attributable to horizontal difference of the\nmeasurement regions covered with the EISCAT UHF radar\nand the Skibotn FPI. While vertical wind speeds were\nmeasured in the small field of view of the Skibotn FPI,\nelectron densities and ion velocity vectors used for calcu-\nlating the heating rates were sampled in the four separated\ndirections from the EISCAT UHF radar as shown in\nFigures 1 and 5. It is suggested from the electron densities\nand ion temperatures in Figure 3 and the all-sky camera\nimages as in Figure 5 that the heating rates were not horizon-\ntally uniform in the measurement region of the EISCAT UHF\nradar during 00:00\u201301:00 UT, and that the estimated heating\nrates in this period may not be proportional to the actual\nheating rates in the measurement region of the Skibotn FPI.\nThe heating rates in the other periods are suggested to\nbe horizontally uniform in the measurement region of the\nEISCAT UHF radar because the electron densities and ion\ntemperatures are similar in the four directions.\n[27] It should be noted that the altitude at which the\nvertical wind was measured may have varied during this\ntime period. The effective altitude of the auroral green line\nemission at 00:34\u201300:37 UT was determined to be about\n120 km from the ASC observations [Kurihara et al., 2006].\nThen, the neutral temperature by the Skibotn FPI 557.7 nm\nobservation showed a sharp drop from 500 K to 400 K level\nafter 01:00 UT [Griffin et al., 2006], suggesting a decrease\nof the green line emission height down to about 110 km.\nThis result also suggests an increase of the characteristic\nenergy of precipitating auroral electrons and lowering of\nthe peak altitude of qp, and in fact, the peak altitudes of qp\nFigure 7. Time variations of the height-integrated heating rate (solid line) and vertical wind speed\n(dashed line) smoothed using a three point running average.\nA12306 KURIHARA ET AL.: DELTA CAMPAIGN\n9 of 13\nA12306\nand qJ\nE were 105\u2013110 km and 120 km, respectively, in the\ninterval of 01:30\u201301:45 UT when upward vertical winds up\nto 30 m s\u00021 were observed.\n[28] These results support the suggestion by Price and\nJacka [1991] that large upward winds of 30 m s\u00021 at\naltitudes higher than 110 km are produced by a combination\nof Joule and particle heating, while large upward winds at\nlower altitudes are the consequence of particle heating\nbelow that height. Their suggestion is based on FPI 557.7\nnm observations with a partial reflection radar observation\nfor enhanced ionization in the D region. However, they have\nnot obtained actual auroral heating rates. Oyama et al.\n[2008] compared the height-resolved vertical winds with\nthe height-integrated auroral heating rates using a tristatic\nexperiment with the EISCAT UHF radar. They found large\nupward winds in excess of 30 m s\u00021 at 109, 114, 120 km\naltitudes in association with a heating event and large\ndownward winds in excess of \u201330 m s\u00021 before and after\nthe heating event. Although their result is similar to the\npresent result in several points such as magnitudes of the\nvertical winds and auroral heating rates, they have not\ndiscussed the altitude profile of the auroral heating rates.\n[29] It should also be noted that the large downward\nwinds in excess of \u000220 m s\u00021 were observed during\n22:50\u201323:30 UT. Although large downward winds in the\nlower and upper thermosphere have often been observed at\nthe equatorward side of an auroral arc [Crickmore et al.,\n1991; Innis et al., 1997; Ishii et al., 2001], there is no\nplausible explanation for the large downward winds [Ishii et\nal., 2001]. There may be a simple explanation that upward\nwinds must be compensated by downward winds to keep\nthe atmosphere from disappearing. However, it is difficult to\nfind a counterpart to the observed downward winds because\nof the horizontal motion. In the present observation the large\ndownward winds were found in a period of very low heating\nrate as shown in Figure 6 and the altitude of the large\ndownward winds is unknown because the emission altitude\ncannot be estimated in this period. The explanation for the\nlarge downward winds is an important issue to be studied in\nthe future.\n[30] Upward vertical winds generated by the thermal\nexpansion due to heating can be estimated using the first\nlaw of thermodynamics\nw \u00bc q\nr Cp dTdz \u00fe g\n\u0004 \u0005 ; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere w is the vertical wind speed, q is the total heating\nrate, r is the neutral mass density, Cp is the specific heat at\nconstant pressure, T is the neutral temperature, and g is the\nacceleration due to gravity [Hays et al., 1973]. The values of\nr and Cp are calculated from the MSISE-90 model density\nand composition. The vertical temperature gradient dT\/dz is\n15 K km\u00021 at 120 km from the observed temperature profile\nand this value is not much different from the MSISE-90\nmodel temperature gradient of 18 K km\u00021 at 120 km. The\nderived vertical wind speed is \u00032 m s\u00021 at 120 km, when\nthe heating rate is 0.5 mWm\u00023. This result demonstrates that\nthe estimated heating rate is at least one order of magnitude\nsmaller than that required to generate the observed vertical\nwind speed by thermal expansion.\n[31] Most of the previous studies have indicated that the\nestimated heating rate is one order of magnitude smaller\nthan the required heating rate for the observed large upward\nwinds in the lower thermosphere [Wescott et al., 2006;\nOyama et al., 2008]. A highly complicated nonhydrostatic\nmodel also faced the problem of lower speed of the\nsimulated vertical wind than the observed magnitude in\nthe lower thermosphere [Shinagawa et al., 2003]. On the\nother hand, some recent models succeeded in reproducing\nlarge upward winds of the observed magnitude in the upper\natmosphere [Russell et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2008].\n[32] The present study quantified the temporal response\nof the vertical winds to the auroral heating event and the\nrelative importance of Joule and particle heating to vertical\nwinds at each altitude using the data independently\nobserved with the FPI and the EISCAT UHF radar. The\nresponse time of vertical winds to the auroral heating event\nseems to be very fast and at least comparable to the\nsampling interval of the vertical winds, 7 min 20 s. This\nresult suggests the generation mechanism of large vertical\nwinds could respond instantaneously to changes in the\nauroral heating rate. Although the observed vertical wind\nspeeds cannot be explained by the observed heating rate and\nthe thermal expansion hypothesis, the thermal expansion\nremains a potential mechanism that can respond rapidly to\nchanges in the auroral heating rate.\n4.2. Temperature Enhancements\n[33] The auroral heating event studied here gave a good\nopportunity to estimate the temperature enhancement by\nauroral heating, because the strong heating event started\nsuddenly after the long duration of low heating rates.\nFigure 8a shows the altitude profile of the average auroral\nheating rates from 00:03 to 00:33 UT. In this period, the\naveraged qJ\nE was 4\u201310 times larger than the averaged qp and\ntheir total heating rate had a peak of 0.5 mW m\u00023 at 120 km\naltitude.\n[34] The temperature increase rate can be estimated by\ndividing the heating rate by the specific heat and the mass\ndensity of the neutral atmosphere\n@T\n@t\n\u00bc q\nrCp\n: \u00f07\u00de\nThe value of r is calculated from the MSISE-90 model\ndensity. Figure 8c shows the derived temperature increase\nrates and, for the purpose of reference, Figure 8b shows the\naverage auroral heating rates per unit weight, q\/r. Although\nthe total heating rate per unit volume in Figure 8a peaks at\n120 km and decreases above that height, the temperature\nincrease rate in Figure 8c monotonically increases with\naltitude in the lower thermosphere. This is because the mass\ndensity decreases more rapidly than the heating rate, as is\nclearly seen from Figure 8b. These results seem inconsistent\nwith the uniform temperature difference of 70\u2013140 K\nbetween the observed N2 rotational temperature and the\nMSIS model neutral temperature at 110\u2013140 km altitude in\nFigure 2b. There are also significant differences between the\nobserved N2 rotational temperature and the EISCAT quiet\ntime ion temperature, particularly in 112\u2013128 km altitude\nduring the ascent. If the auroral heating event had started\nfrom 00:03 UT and lasted for 30 minutes until the rocket\nA12306 KURIHARA ET AL.: DELTA CAMPAIGN\n10 of 13\nA12306\nlaunch, temperature enhancements expected from the\nobserved temperature increase rate are calculated to be\n4 K, 47 K, 77 K, and 86 K at 110 km, 120 km, 130 km, and\n140 km, respectively. The estimated temperature enhance-\nments are within the uncertainties of the observed\ntemperature enhancements above 130 km but are much\nsmaller below 120 km.\n[35] As discussed in Section 4.1, the heating rates during\n00:00\u201301:00 UT are suggested to be horizontally nonuni-\nform within the measurement region of the EISCAT UHF\nradar. Furthermore, horizontal distances between the rocket\ntrajectory above 100 km altitude and the EISCAT UHF radar\nsite ranged from 120 to 130 km. Although there can be a\ndifference between temperature enhancements estimated\nfrom the data taken with the EISCAT UHF radar and those\ntaken with the rocket-borne instrument, a difference between\naltitude variations of the temperature enhancements can be\ncaused by a reason other than the horizontal distance.\n[36] In Section 3, the passive energy deposition rate was\nintroduced as an alternative to the Joule heating rate by\nneglecting the neutral wind effect (U \u0004 B). Since this\nassumption was validated with the neutral wind data from\nthe FPI observation, it was concluded that the passive\nenergy deposition rate is almost identical to the Joule\nheating rate for the data set analyzed in this paper. Never-\ntheless, it is important to consider the height-dependent\nneutral wind effect, u \u0004 B, where u is the neutral wind\nspeed at a specific altitude, because this term actually can\neither strengthen the Joule heating rate if u \u0004 B and E are\nparallel, or reduce the Joule heating rate if they are antipar-\nallel [Brekke et al., 1991; Brekke, 1997]. The horizontal\nwind speed estimated from the FPI observation is expected\nto correspond to the wind at a height where the green line\nemission has a peak, and the actual speed at a specific\naltitude can vary significantly. Nozawa et al. [2006] ana-\nlyzed neutral winds observed with the EISCAT UHF radar\nduring the campaign and derived semidiurnal tidal ampli-\ntudes and phases from 98 to 110 km altitudes. They found\nthat the day-to-day variability of the semidiurnal tide was\nprominent for the amplitude and its peak altitude. The\nsemidiurnal amplitude on the night of 12\u201313 December\nappeared to maximize at and below 104 km with a value of\n100\u2013120 m s\u00021, and wind speeds during 00:00\u201301:00 UT\non 13 December ranged from 0 to 200 m s\u00021. If there was a\nwind speed of 200 m s\u00021 at any altitude under an electric\nfield of 50 mV m\u00021, it could either strengthen the Joule\nheating rate by up to 40% or reduce it by up to 33%,\ndepending on the wind direction. By this means, the\nestimation of the Joule heating rate could be improved by\nobserving neutral winds in the whole altitude range.\n[37] It is notable that neutral density is one of the most\nimportant factors for the estimation of temperature increase\nrate in the lower thermosphere, especially below 120 km.\nAs already mentioned in Section 3, the Joule and passive\nenergy deposition rate below 110 km is inversely propor-\ntional to the neutral number density. Furthermore, the\ntemperature increase rate in Equation (7) is derived by\ndividing the total heating rate by the neutral mass density.\nTherefore, temperature increase rate below 110 km can be\nproportional to the inverse square of the neutral density\nwhen the Joule heating prevails over the particle heating,\nand at least, the temperature increase rate is inversely\nproportional to the neutral density at all altitudes for either\nheating process. The same is true for the vertical wind speed\nestimation because vertical wind speed in Equation (6) is\nalso derived by dividing the total heating rate by the neutral\nnumber density.\n[38] In this study, the temperature enhancement is defined\nassuming the MSIS model neutral temperature as the\nground state. On the other hand, the temperature increase\nrate is derived using theMSISmodel neutral density, which is\nlikely to be different from the ground state. Kurihara et al.\n[2006] reported that the N2 number density observed simul-\ntaneously with the rotational temperature by the rocket-borne\ninstrument is much lower than the MSIS model and changes\nwith altitude from 30% of the MSIS model N2 number\nFigure 8.

Their absolute\ndensity measurement may include systematic error caused by\nthe aerodynamic effect, which cannot be easily corrected, but\ntheir relative density measurement is highly reliable. Their\nresult suggests a relative decrease (increase) of neutral\ndensity in lower (higher) altitude. If the neutral density is\n25% of the MSIS model N2 number density at 110 km, the\nobserved temperature enhancement can be explained only by\na temperature increase rate due to the auroral heating effect.\nThis neutral density decrease is also able to explain the\nobserved large vertical wind. However, such a large decrease\nof the neutral density is unrealistic in the lower thermosphere\neven in highly disturbed conditions. Therefore, an additional\nmechanism is required to explain the observed temperature\nenhancements below 120 km.\n5. Summary and Conclusions\n[39] In this paper, temperature enhancements and upward\nvertical winds in the polar lower thermosphere associated\nwith geomagnetic disturbance during the DELTA campaign\nwere investigated. The height-resolved passive energy\ndeposition rate and particle heating rate in the lower\nthermosphere were derived from the data taken with the\nEISCAT UHF radar and compared with the N2 rotational\ntemperature observed in situ by the rocket-borne instrument\nand with the vertical wind speed observed from the auroral\ngreen line emission by the ground-based FPI.\n[40] The vertical winds seem to respond nearly instanta-\nneously to changes in the heating rates and the wind speeds\nwere associated with the height-integrated passive energy\ndeposition rate and particle heating rate. A closer relationship\nwith the passive energy deposition rate was found when the\nestimated height of vertical winds was about 120 km,\nlikewise with the particle heating rate when the estimated\nheight was about 110 km. The present study demonstrates\nthat the observed vertical wind speed cannot be explained\nby the estimated heating rate and the thermal expansion\nhypothesis. It is suggested that the generation mechanism\nof large vertical winds must be responsible for the fast\nresponse of the vertical winds to an auroral heating event.\n[41] The temperature enhancements defined by the\ndifference between the observed N2 rotational temperature\nand the MSISE-90 model value were uniformly 70\u2013140 K\nat 110\u2013140 km altitude. Neutral density is potentially\nimportant for understanding the dynamics and energetics\nin the polar lower thermosphere because equations of the\nvertical wind speed and temperature increase rate are\nfunction of the neutral density. However, the observed\ntemperature enhancements below 120 km cannot be\nexplained only by the neutral density effect.\n[42] Acknowledgments.
