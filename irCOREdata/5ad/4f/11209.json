We study the isolated substorm that occurred after\na long quiet period, which showed all of the substorm sig-\nnatures except for the first half hour of the expansion phase,\nwhich could be characterized as a pseudobreakup sequence,\nrather than a full-scale substorm onset. During the consid-\nered event, the substorm\u2019s instability leads to a current dis-\nruption, which starts at the near-Earth plasma sheet and then\npropagates tailward. Based on auroral observations, the anal-\nysis of geosynchronous plasma injections, and the plasma\nsheet observations at \u223c15 RE at the meridian of auroral sub-\nstorm development we show that (1) before and probably\nduring \u201cpseudobreakup phase\u201d, the plasma sheet stayed cold\nand dense, (2) during the pseudobreakup phase, particle in-\njections at 6.6 RE were only seen in unusually low energy\ncomponents, and (3) the electron precipitation into the iono-\nsphere was very soft. We conclude that the basic differ-\nence between pseudobreakups and \u201creal\u201d substorm activa-\ntions was found in the low energy of all manifestations. We\nsuggest that high density and low electron temperature in\nthe plasma sheet are the reasons for low energization in the\nmagnetic reconnection operated on closed field lines in the\nplasma sheet, as well as the weak field-aligned acceleration,\nas predicted by the Knight\u2019s relationship. The low Hall con-\nductivity could then be the reason for the weak ground mag-\nnetic effects observed.

The ground-based and mag-\nnetospheric signatures of these phases are:\n\u2022 Quiet auroral arcs move towards the equator during the\ngrowth phase; the auroral breakups, occurring at different\nlongitudes and latitudes, form the multiple onsets, and a\nstrong poleward expansion in a wide longitudinal sector oc-\ncurs during the poleward leap phase;\n\u2022 Sharp negative magnetic bays, and Pi2 and PiB pulsa-\ntions occur in the auroral zone during the expansive phase,\nand the disturbance shifts to higher latitudes during the pole-\nward leap;\n\u2022 In the mid-tail (15\u201320 RE), the impulsive plasma sheet\nthinning is associated with the expansive phase onset, and the\nplasma sheet expansion is associated with the poleward leap\nof the auroras;\n\u2022 During a geosynchronous orbit, energetic particle injec-\ntions and magnetic field dipolarizations are observed at the\nexpansive phase onset and during substorm activations.\nThe most spectacular auroral signature of the substorm\nis the auroral breakup which is a strong brightening of the\npre-exiting homogeneous auroral arc, which breaks into sep-\narate rays and fragments. Another class of disturbances, the\n\u201cpseudobreakups\u201d, is also frequent in the auroral zone. Aka-\nsofu (1964) used this term to distinguish those auroral arc\n688 A. G.

Today\nthis term is often used in that sense as well (e.g. Pulkkinen,\n1996). Typically, pseudobreakups are localized (McPherron,\n1991; Nakamura et al., 1994), but Koskinen et al. (1993)\npresented an example of a longitudinally extended event.\nThe question disputed is: Do pseudobreakups differ from\nthe substorm breakups in their physical mechanism? Al-\nthough the above mentioned differences between pseudo-\nbreakups and \u201creal\u201d breakups are sometimes strongly pro-\nnounced, the similarity of ground-based signatures was also\nnoted. Yahnin et al. (1984) noted that even during very lo-\ncalized auroral activations, the sensitive magnetometers were\nable to register weak Pi2 pulsations. The PiB and Pi2 pul-\nsations were found during the pseudobreakup events stud-\nied, for example, by Koskinen et al. (1993) and Aikio et al.\n(1999).\nSergeev et al. (1986) postulated that localized auroral arc\nflares with a low repetition rate are pseudobreakups (they\ndo not produce a significant magnetic effect and occur dur-\ning calm or growth phase conditions), but the flares grouped\ninto the sequence with a repetition rate of one per 1\u20133 min-\nutes form the \u201creal substorm\u201d activations. It was suggested\n(e.g. Koskinen et al., 1993, Ohtani et al., 1993) that the iono-\nsphere plays an important role, and the formation of the au-\nroral bulge and the ground magnetic effects depends on iono-\nspheric conductivity.\nThis paper is devoted to the further investigation of pseu-\ndobreakup and substorm similarities and differences. The\nstudy is based on the large set of ground-based and satel-\nlite observations, which allows one to probe the plasma sheet\npopulation in two regions (at geosynchronous orbit and mid-\ntail), as well as to estimate the characteristics of the electron\nflux precipitating into the ionosphere. In Sect. 2, we give a\ngeneral description of the observations on the ground and in\nthe magnetosphere during the pseudobreakup\/substorm event\non 16 November 1995. Sections 3 and 4 present the data in\ndetail. In Sect. 5, we discuss the obtained results, and in\nSect. 6, the summary and conclusions are given.\n2 Observations\nA very isolated substorm (it had been preceded by several\nhours of geomagnetic calmness) occurred at 22\u201324 UT on\n16 November 1995. At that time, the ground-based observa-\ntional campaign related to the Interball satellite mission was\nin progress. A general description of the geophysical situa-\ntion during this substorm has been published by Sergeev et\nal. (1996a, 1999).\nDuring this substorm, the Interball-1 satellite made\nthe measurements in the nightside magnetosphere (X =\n\u221215.0RE , Y = \u22123.7RE, Z = \u22121.8RE) in the lon-\ngitudinal sector of the intense ground-based observations\n(Fig. 1). In this study, we present observations by CORALL,\nELECTRON, DOK-2 and MIF-M experiments onboard the\nInterball-1 spacecraft. CORALL is the nearly-hemispheric\nelectrostatic analyzer which measured the ions with ener-\ngies 0.3\u201324 keV\/q (Yermolaev et al., 1997). ELECTRON\n(Sauvaud et al., 1997) is a \u201ctop-hat\u201d quadri-spherical elec-\ntron spectrometer that uses the microchannel plates to mea-\nsure the electrons with energies ranging from 0.01 to 26 keV.\nThe DOK-2 spectrometer (Lutsenko et al., 1998) measures\nthe energy spectra of electrons and ions using four telescopes\nwith solid-state silicon detectors. The energy ranges are: 20\u2013\n850 keV for ions and 25\u2013400 keV for electrons. Fluxgate\nmagnetometer MIF-M provides three component measure-\nments of the magnetic field (Klimov et al., 1997).\nFour LANL geosynchronous satellites 1990\u2013095, 1987\u2013\n097, 1991\u2013080, and 1994\u2013084 monitored the charged parti-\ncles at 19.5, 22.0, 02.6, and 04.9 MLT (the MLT is given for\n22 UT). They (except the satellite 1987\u2013097) were equipped\nwith two sets of sensors: the MPA instrument (Bame et al.,\n1993; McComas et al., 1993) measured particles from some\neV up to 40 keV, and the SOPA instrument (Belian et al.,\n1992) measured particles with energies more than 50 keV\n(unfortunately, the SOPA energetic proton data were unavail-\nable for this case at satellite 1990\u2013095). The satellite 1987\u2013\n097 carried the CPA instrument measuring the>30 keV elec-\ntrons and >80 keV protons (Higbie et al., 1978).\nThe ground network used consisted of IMAGE magne-\ntometers (Viljanen and Hakkinen, 1997), a Finnish chain of\npulsation magnetometers, four auroral TV all-sky cameras\nof Polar Geophysical Institute (PGI), which were situated\nA.

(1996a,\n1999) concluded that the growth phase of this substorm star-\nted at around 2220 UT. At that time, a SI-like disturbance\nin the ground magnetic field had been registered. Simulta-\nneously, the polar cap index (PC-index) characterizing the\nintensity of convection started to increase. Such an increase\nis usually associated with the southward turning of the in-\nterplanetary magnetic field (this could not be confirmed by\nthe IMF data because they were fragmentary for the time of\ninterest).\nThe aurora dynamics is illustrated by Fig. 2, which presents\na keogram of the auroral TV camera in Porojarvi. The quiet\nauroral arc moving to the south was registered from 2220\nUT until 2307 UT, when the first auroral activation occurred.\nBetween 2307 and 2336 UT, several auroral activations were\nseen, but they were not followed by any strong and fast pole-\nward expansion. Such an expansion took place only after\n2336\u201337 UT, when a new arc appeared poleward of the pre-\nexisting auroras and formed the WTS-like structure west-\nward of the meridian of Porojarvi.\nThe data of the scanning photometer in Kiruna (Fig. 3)\nshow the intensity of the 427.8 and 630.0 nm emissions; here\nthe altitude for the emissions 427.8 and 630.0 nm was taken\nto be 100 and 180 km, respectively. Before 2307 UT, smooth\nvariations of the luminosity were due to the southward drift\nof the quiet auroral arc. Sharp spikes accompanied the au-\nroral flares after 2307 UT. It is clear from Fig. 3 that the\naveraged I427.7\/I630.0 ratio, which depends on the hardness\nof the energetic spectrum of precipitating electrons, is less\nfor the time interval 2307\u20132336 UT than for the time after\n2336 UT. As seen from the IMAGE data (Fig. 4), before\n2307 UT, a weak westward electrojet developed over Scandi-\nnavia. Between 2307 and 2336 UT, weak fluctuations associ-\nated with the auroral activations disturbed a smooth increase\nFig. 3.

Magnetic field variations exceeding \u223c100\nnT started only after 2336 UT, simultaneously with the pole-\nward leap of the electrojet. At the same time, a magnetic bay\ndeveloped in a wide longitudinal sector, as evidenced by the\nmagnetograms from the Siberian and Iceland stations (data\nnot shown).\nAuroral activations were accompanied by several clear PiB\nbursts starting at 2307 UT (Fig. 5).

Manninen, Sodankyla\nGeophysical Observatory, private communication).\n4 Satellite data\n4.1 Interball-1\nDuring the time interval of interest, the Interball-1 spacecraft\nwas in the mid-tail in the longitudinal sector of the auroral ac-\ntivations detected from the ground. Both low-energy particle\ninstruments CORALL and ELECTRON registered a rather\ncold (Te \u2248 0.2\u20130.4 keV, Ti \u2248 1\u20132 keV) and dense (n \u2248\n1 cm\u22123) plasma sheet population (\u03b2 = Pthermal\/Pmagnetic >\n1) before the substorm. These data, along with simultane-\nous measurements onboard the Geotail spacecraft, are pub-\nlished by Sergeev et al. (1999). The plasma density and\ntemperature measured by Geotail in the central plasma sheet\nat (X = \u221222.0, Y = 2.6, Z = \u22122.7) were almost the same\nas the measured by Interball-1.\nFigure 6 shows the electron flux measured by the ELEC-\nTRON instrument along with magnetic field data obtained\nby MIF-M (here the data with time resolution of \u223c1 s were\nFig. 5. PiB pulsations registered at Kilpisjarvi: wave-form is shown\nat the top, and dynamic spectrum is shown at the bottom. Vertical\nlines mark the interval 2307\u20132336 UT.\nused). A sharp decrease in particle energy and an increase\nin the Bx-component of the magnetic field, up to some 40\nnT, had been detected around 2307 UT, which is in agree-\nment with the first auroral and PiB activations. Such be-\nhaviour of the plasma and magnetic field is expected dur-\ning the plasma sheet thinning. Energetic particle fluxes mea-\nsured by the DOK-2 instrument also dropped sharply around\n2307 UT (Fig. 7). One more severe plasma sheet depletion\n(which we also could interpret as plasma sheet thinning) oc-\ncurred at 2337 UT, when the plasma sheet disappeared at the\nInterball-1 location. During this thinning the magnetic field\nmagnitude decreased. During most of the time between 2307\nand 2337 UT, the satellite was in the outer part of the plasma\nsheet rather than in the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL).\nIn this region, characterized by \u03b2 = 0.1 \u2212 0.2 (see Fig. 8),\nno typical PSBL fast plasma flows were detected, and both\ndensity and temperature changed smoothly (data not shown).\nAround 2342 UT, a sharp increase of particle flux occurred\nsimultaneously with a strong decrease in the magnetic field,\nindicating the plasma sheet expansion. The spacecraft en-\ntered the central plasma sheet (\u03b2 > 1), where the measured\nelectrons energized up to\u223c10 times in comparison with those\ndetected before 2307 UT (Fig. 6). In Fig. 7, the \u201cstreaming\nindex\u201d which is the ratio of the energetic proton flux stream-\ning Earthward to the energetic proton flux streaming tailward\nis also presented. The strongest plasma anisotropy was found\nat 2337 UT (tailward flux dominate), and at 2342 UT, the\nfluxes sharply changed their direction to Earthward.\nBoth plasma and magnetic data with 2-minute averaging\nwere used to calculate the total (magnetic plus plasma) pres-\nsure at the Interball-1 position (Fig. 8). The square root of\nthe total pressure is proportional to the lobe magnetic field\nand the total plasma sheet current. A general increase in the\ntotal pressure after \u223c2220 UT stopped at around 2307 UT.\nA. G. Yahnin et al.: Correlated Interball\/ground-based observations of isolated substorm 691\nFig. 6.

Although the substorm-like\ninjections were absent, these data show some substorm sig-\nnatures. For instance, after the first auroral activation onset,\nthe satellites 1991\u2013080 and 1994\u2013084 in the morning sector\nobserved the \u201cDrifting Electron Hole\u201d (DEH), which is a re-\nmote signature of magnetic field dipolarization westward of\nthe satellite (Sergeev et al., 1992). The DEH at the satel-\nlite 1991\u2013080 has a very distinct dispersion that enables us\nto estimate the time of dipolarization onset to be 2309 UT\n(Fig. 10a). Tracing back (in coordinates UT-MLT) the DEHs\nseen at different locations and different energies gives us the\ntime of dipolarization to be 2308:15 UT (Fig. 10b). Both es-\ntimates are close to the first pseudobreakup onset. Figure 10b\ncan also be used to locate the eastern edge of the dipolariza-\ntion region at 2.5 MLT.\nInjection of energetic electrons has been detected at geo-\nsynchronous orbit only after 2345 UT. However, before this\ntime, the injection-like enhancements were observed in the\nlow-energy component measured by the MPA instrument\n(Figs. 11a and 11b). In the morning sector, 3\u20134 weak proton\nenhancements were seen at the 1990\u2013080 spacecraft between\n2320 and 2330 UT, in association with small energetic elec-\ntron flux depletions detected by SOPA, which could be the\ndiamagnetic effect. As for electron enhancements, the first\none was very weak and, evidently, it was a low-energy coun-\nterpart of the above-described DEH. Coexistence of such a\ndispersed low-energy injection and a high-energy depletion\nis an intrinsic feature of the DEH phenomena (Sergeev et al.,\n692 A. G.

Vertical lines mark the interval 2307\u2013\n2336 UT.\n1992). Typically, the threshold between the DEH-related in-\njections and depletions lies in the range of the SOPA instru-\nment (E > 50 keV). This and some following enhancements\nwere seen only at energies E < 10 keV.\nWestward from the substorm region, the satellites 1990\u2013\n095 and 1987\u2013097 detected very little changes in the en-\nergetic particle data (Fig. 8). But the MPA instrument on-\nboard 1990\u2013095 detected a smooth increase in the flux of the\nplasma sheet protons (Fig. 11b). Some proton injection-like\nenhancements could be discerned in MPA data after 2330\nUT; they were also accompanied by depletions in the ener-\ngetic electron fluxes.\n5 Discussion\n5.1 Pseudobreakup phase (2307\u20132336 UT)\nThe timeline of the considered event is presented in Table 1.\nThere is no doubt that the event is a substorm.

Vertical lines mark the\ninterval 2307\u20132336 UT.\nical for the growth and expansion phases of an auroral sub-\nstorm. This phase categorization agrees with the other ob-\nservations listed in Sects. 3 and 4. For example, the growth\nphase is confirmed by the increase in total pressure (tail cur-\nrent) before 2307 UT. The onset of the expansion phase is\nconsistent with the signatures of the current disruption, the\nplasma sheet thinning at a distance of \u223c15 RE , and the DEH\nobservation in the near-Earth magnetosphere, which suggests\ndipolarization. Such dipolarization in the near-Earth tail lo-\ncation, as well as the plasma sheet thinning in the mid-tail,\nare basic substorm signatures (e.g. Hones, 1979; Lui, 1991).\nPlasma sheet expansion in the mid-tail during the poleward\nexpansion (leap) of the auroras is also a well-known phe-\nnomenon (Pytte et al., 1978; Hones, 1979).\nHowever, the considered event differs from the typical sub-\nstorm. The expansion phase onset as well as a few sub-\nsequent activations were not associated with the significant\nground magnetic field variations (Fig. 5) and the fast pole-\nward propagation of the auroras (Fig. 2). The first significant\n(>100 nT) magnetic disturbance started after 2337 UT when\nthe new poleward arc appeared, thus starting the poleward\nexpansion. Thus, the initial multiple onset stage manifested\nitself as a series of pseudobreakups. We call this interval\na \u201cpseudobreakup phase\u201d in Table 1.

Some of the latest pseudobreakups spread up to\nMLT = 21 and MLT = 04, according to the low energy par-\nticle injections observed there by the geosynchronous satel-\nlites (Figs. 11a and 11b).\n5.2 Possible interpretation of the mid-tail dynamics\nThe available data do not directly support any specific mech-\nanism of a substorm. We suppose, however, that the Near-\nEarth Neutral Line (NENL) model (Hones, 1979) provides a\nframework for interpreting the mid-tail plasma sheet dynam-\nics. According to this model, a substorm starts with a recon-\nnection process in the NENL location. The reconnection pro-\nduces the Earthward and tailward plasma flows; dipolariza-\ntion occurs Earthward of the NENL, while the plasma sheet\nthinning occurs tailward of the NENL. The reconnection that\nstarts on closed field lines forms the plasmoid, which is ejec-\nted to the tail.\nThe Interball-1 spacecraft was in the longitudinal sector\nof the substorm during the onset at 2307 UT. It registered\nneither Earthward plasma flows nor magnetic field dipolar-\nization, expected in the case of the tailward source location.\nPartial plasma sheet thinning, however, was observed. We\ninterpret this as the result of a magnetic reconnection oper-\nating at X > \u221215RE within the closed plasma sheet flux\ntubes. In such a case, the satellite at the plasma sheet periph-\nery might be unable to detect the tailward moving plasmoid.\nMost probably, in our case, the reconnection region remained\nat X > \u221215RE during the pseudobreakup phase. The total\npressure slightly decreased due to the current disruption in\nthe NENL vicinity.\nThe strong activation at 2336\u201337 UT when the new arc ap-\npeared poleward has a remarkable difference. At this time,\nthe new complete plasma dropout occurred, but in contrast to\nthe previous one (at 2307 UT), the magnetic field strength at\nthe Interball-1 location decreased (Fig. 6). The total pressure\nalso sharply decreased (Fig. 8). At the same time, the first\nsignatures of the tailward anisotropy of the energetic pro-\n694 A. G.

These observations are consistent with a strong recon-\nnection on open field lines occurred close to Interball-1, but\nstill Earthward from it. Together with ground-based signa-\ntures (step-like poleward expansion of auroras via new arc\nformation), this suggests a reappearance of the active region\nfurther tailward in the magnetosphere. Then, around 2342\nUT, the active region shifted further to the tail. This is con-\nfirmed by the observed plasma sheet expansion, the dipolar-\nization of the magnetic field, and the Earthward anisotropy\nof the energetic protons. The Earthward particle burst was\nrather short; this can be explained by the flow concentration\nnear the plasma sheet boundary.\n5.3 Particle energization\nBelow we show that the pseudobreakup phase differs from\nthe following activations in the particle energy in the mid-\ntail, at the geosynchronous orbit, and in the precipitation.\nSome information on the auroral electron precipitation can\nbe obtained from ground-based photometer measurements.\nUsing the auroral electron transport model by Sergienko and\nIvanov (1993), together with the auroral \u201cred line\u201d (630.0\nnm) model by Solomon et al. (1988), the dependence of the\nemission intensity ratio I630.0\/I427.8 on the electron charac-\nteristic energy, as well as the dependence of the 427.8 nm\nemission intensity on the electron energy flux has been cal-\nculated. These results and the measurements of the \u201cred\u201d\n(630.0 nm) and \u201cblue\u201d (427.8 nm) emissions shown in Fig. 3\nwere used to estimate the parameters of the auroral electron\nflux. To avoid the errors related to the ignorance of the real\naltitude of different emissions, the calculation was done for\nthe zenith of Kiruna. The calculated parameters (character-\nistic energy and energy flux, Fig. 12, top panel) were used\nas input to make an estimate of the ionospheric conductiv-\nity variations (Fig. 12, middle panel). According to these\ncalculations, both the characteristic energy of precipitating\nelectrons and ionospheric conductivity were low during the\npseudobreakup phase, although the electron energy flux was\nstrong enough (>1 erg cm\u22122s\u22121) to produce the bright vis-\nible aurora. In contrast, all values increased rapidly after\n2337 UT. Magnetic disturbance on the ground is proportional\nto the ionospheric current and, therefore, proportional to the\nconductivity. In Fig. 12 (bottom), we present the magnetic\nvariations registered in Muonio (the IMAGE station closest\nto Kiruna) to show good correlation between the observed\nmagnetic variations and calculated conductivity.\nAlthough during the pseudobreakup phase the Interball-1\nwas in the longitudinal sector of auroral activations, it did not\nobserve any signatures of plasma energization. This might be\ndue to two reasons. First, the energization was localized, and\nthe satellite which was located in the outer plasma sheet was\nnot in a favorable position to monitor the region of energiza-\ntion. Second, the energization was weak. Indirect confirma-\ntion of the second possibility comes from the ground optical\ndata. Indeed, as discussed above, photometer data indicate\nthe increased precipitating electron energy (E > 1 keV) af-\nter 2337 UT (Fig. 12). During the interval 2337\u20132342 UT,\nthe satellite was at the plasma sheet\/tail lobe boundary, but\nwhen the satellite moved inside the expanding plasma sheet\n(dipolarization region), it measured an electron temperature\nincrease up to >1 keV. Such correlation suggests that the low\n(<1 keV) energy of precipitating electrons during the pseu-\ndobreakup phase may correspond to the low energy in the\nplasma sheet. Thus, we do not expect that during the pseu-\ndobreakup phase the electron temperature would increased\nsignificantly, in comparison to the electron temperature be-\nfore the first plasma sheet thinning (0.2\u20130.4 keV). Note that\nduring the pseudobreakup phase, the Geotail spacecraft did\nnot detect any significant changes in the plasma sheet param-\neters. This might be because the spacecraft was outside the\nsubstorm activation region (Sergeev et al., 1999).\nVery weak energization of plasma during the pseudobreak-\nup phase is also evident by particle measurements onboard\nthe LANL satellites. During strong substorms, the DEH phe-\nnomenon (drift-dispersed depletion of fluxes at high ener-\ngies) is usually observed together with the injection of elec-\nA. G.

Here, the MPA electron data are presented for 10 energy channels from 2 to 24 keV; the MPA proton data are\npresented for 8 channel from 2 to 13 keV.

The threshold energy between DEH and the\ninjections depends on the radial gradient of the background\nelectron population and on the hardness of the energy spec-\ntrum of the injected electrons (Sergeev et al., 1992). In our\ncase, the signatures of the DEH is found even in the MPA\n(low-energy) electron data (Fig. 11b) with threshold energy\nas low as 10 keV. Indeed, the SOPA instrument detects the\nDEH in all energy channels. The dispersed electron flux de-\ncrease is also seen in the higher energy channels of the MPA\ninstrument (E > 10 keV). In contrast, at energies E < 10\nkeV, one can see a weak enhancement of the electron flux\nbeginning at 2320 UT, which is in agreement with the DEH\ndispersion.\nIn the evening sector, the electron injection was also ob-\nserved at energies less than 10 keV at the late stage of the\npseudobreakup phase (Fig. 11a). The low-energy electron\nand proton enhancements seen in the MPA data in Fig. 11 are\na result of the sudden arrival of the accelerated plasma sheet\npopulation associated with the inductive electric field and\nmagnetic field dipolarization (e.g. Birn et al., 1997). Indeed,\nbefore the substorm activation, the geosynchronous space-\ncraft measured clear signatures of plasmaspheric (<10 eV)\nion refilling (data not shown), which disappeared during the\nplasma sheet particle enhancement. The near-Earth plasma\nsheet electron temperature deduced from the MPA measure-\nments was <0.5 keV during the pseudobreakup phase, and it\nincreased up to 0.7\u20131.5 keV after 2337 UT. The high-energy\n(tens keV) electron injection has been detected at geosyn-\nchronous orbit only after 2345 UT (Fig. 11b), which is in\nagreement with the mid-tail energization signatures and those\nrevealed from the ground-based optical measurements.\nHence, the observations indicate that during the pseudo-\nbreakups, the source of the precipitation (plasma sheet) re-\nmained, consisting of cold and dense plasma, and the soft\nelectron precipitation, i.e. no significant field-aligned ac-\nceleration, was observed. We suggest two ways how the\nplasma sheet parameters can influence the electron energiza-\ntion and precipitation. First is the magnetic reconnection pro-\ncess while it is operating on closed field lines of the plasma\nsheet. As discussed by Sergeev et al. (1996b), dense plasma\ndepresses both the reconnection rate and the energy gain per\nparticle, which is given as 1W \u223c B2N\u22121, where B is the\nmagnetic field in the tail lobe and N is the plasma density in\nthe inflow region. A stronger energization, as well as a faster\nreconnection rate, is expected when reconnection starts to in-\nvolve open field lines (and low-density plasma). In the re-\nconnection models of the substorm, the neutral line is associ-\nated with the poleward edge of auroral bulge (e.g. Pudovkin\net al., 1991).

The acceleration is thought to be necessary to\nsupport the field-aligned currents in the loss-cone portion of\nthe electron distribution function. According to the Knight\nrelationship (Knight, 1973; see, also, Lyons and Williams,\n1984), the field-aligned potential drop (18) required to sup-\nport the field-aligned current is proportional to T 1\/2e N\u22121e .\nTherefore, low Te and large Ne in the plasma sheet during\nthe pseudobreakup phase suggest a low 18 and a soft en-\nergy spectra of the precipitating electrons.\nThe large plasma density also secures the substantial en-\nergy flux of precipitating electrons and, therefore, bright au-\nroras while the electron energy could be low. The soft spectra\nof precipitating electrons are responsible for the low level of\nthe ionospheric conductivity and, as result, the weak iono-\nspheric current and ground magnetic disturbances. In turn,\nthe increase in the energy of precipitating electrons results\nin the increase in 6H and 6H \/6P and, consequently, the\nincrease in 6C (Cowling conductivity), which causes the en-\nhancement of the electrojet.\nTerasawa et al. (1997) and Fujimoto et al. (1998) have\nshown that cold and dense plasma populates the plasma sheet\nafter intervals of northward interplanetary magnetic field,\ni.e. quiet geomagnetic conditions. This suggests that well\nisolated substorms which occurred after long calm inter-\nvals should start with the \u201cpseudobreakup phase\u201d (auroral\nbreakups without significant magnetic disturbances on the\nground). In contrast, the substorm expansion onset which\noccurred after short quiet intervals or during disturbed con-\nditions should also have classical signatures in the magnetic\ndata, i.e. a sharp and strong magnetic bay.\n5.4 Comparison with previous observations\nOur findings are in agreement with some previous studies\nof the substorm onset. For example, Sergeev and Yahnin\n(1979b) have found that initial activations in the course of the\ntwo isolated substorms were localized; they did not exhibit\nstrong expansions and had a weak ground magnetic effect.\nUsing the data from several all-sky cameras they made a tri-\nangulation of auroras and found that the altitude of bright au-\nroras was about 140 km. This means that these auroras were\nproduced by low-energy electron precipitation. Mende and\nEather (1976) have noted that the \u201cgreen\u201d aurora breakups\nare often preceded by \u201cred\u201d subvisual breakups. This also\nsuggests that the spectra of precipitating electrons are soft at\nthe beginning and become harder during the course of the\nexpansive phase development. Rostoker (1968) concluded\nthat the large negative excursion of the H -component of the\nmagnetic field often follows the weak magnetic disturbance\n(so-called \u201ctrigger bay\u201d). He also noted that the \u201ctrigger bay\u201d\nmight be accompanied by the same magnetotail signatures as\na typical substorm onset. Nakamura et al. (1994) considered\nthe pseudobreakups as a precursor of the major substorm ex-\npansion. Aikio et al. (1999) defined pseudobreakups as ac-\ntivations with limited (<2 degree) latitudinal auroral expan-\nsion. Although this definition differs from that used in our\npaper and some of their \u201cpseudobreakups\u201d had substantial\nmagnetic effects, Aikio et al. (1999) also reported that the\nA. G.

Magnetic field\nvariations at station Muonio (bottom).\nweakest activations occurred at the beginning of the substorm\nsequence.\nMany authors suggested that pseudobreakups must be very\nlocalized (e.g. Nakamura et al., 1994; McPherron, 1991).\nOur analysis showed that some pseudobreakups could be lo-\ncalized in latitude, but broad in their longitudinal extent. The\nextended pseudobreakup event has been already described by\nKoskinen et al. (1993).\nConcerning the role of reconnection and its location, our\nresults agree with those of Petrukovich et al. (1998), who\ndetermined the location of the reconnection site during the\npseudobreakup to be rather close to the Earth (at \u223c16 RE).\nNagai et al. (1998) also reported on the reconnection event\nwhich started at X > \u221215RE during the pseudobreakup.\n6 Summary and conclusion\nWe considered the auroral event, which in many respects, re-\npeats the typical substorm development. Nevertheless, we\nfound that the onset of the expansion phase, as well as some\nsuccessive activations are, in fact, pseudobreakups, i.e. auro-\nral activations which are not followed by strong poleward ex-\npansions and significant magnetic disturbances. Summariz-\ning the similarities and differences of PBs and substorm-like\nactivations which occurred in the considered case, we note\nthat ground-based and magnetospheric signatures of PBs and\nsubstorms can be similar (auroral activation, PiB, near-Earth\ndipolarization, mid-tail plasma sheet thinning), but there were\nno energetic particle injections, with only very soft (a few\nkeV) particle flux increases at 6.6 RE . Energy spectra of the\nprecipitating electrons are softer during the pseudobreakup\nphase in comparison with those found during the \u201creal sub-\nstorm\u201d activations.\nWe may conclude that in our case, the main difference be-\ntween the pseudobreakups and \u201creal substorm\u201d activations is\na different level of particle energization in the magnetotail\nand in the auroral acceleration region. If the substorm in-\nstability (presumably reconnection) develops in the cold and\ndense plasma, one may expect weak energization. The weak\nacceleration in the auroral acceleration region (again due to\ncold and dense precipitating plasma) leads to the low iono-\nspheric conductivity caused by precipitating electrons and,\nconsequently, to the weak Hall currents and weak ground\nmagnetic effects. In this view, the role of ionospheric (Hall)\nconductivity is \u201cpassive\u201d; it controls primarily the intensity\nof the ground magnetic disturbance, but it is not the main\nfactor which terminates the magnetospheric instability.\nFurther investigation is needed to understand if the rela-\ntionship between the cold\/dense plasma sheet and pseudo-\nbreakups is regular and if the above scenario is applicable to\nother events at the beginning of well isolated (following the\nprolonged interval of quietness) substorms.\nAcknowledgements.
