However, until now it has been unclear if these effects arise from inter-\nference associated with the spatial distribution of the initial state within the molecule or are due to scattering\nof the outgoing photoelectron. In order to resolve this issue we performed synchrotron radiation excited\nvalence band photoemission measurements on multilayer (C59N)2 films. The highest occupied molecular\norbital ~HOMO! of the (C59N)2 dimer is spatially localized, while each half of the dimer remains approxi-\nmately spherical.

First observed\nin solid films of C60 ,1 these intensity modulations have been\nobserved in gas phase C60 ~Ref. 2! and C70 ,3 as well as in\nfilms of (C59N)2 ~Ref. 4! and of higher fullerenes.5 An al-\nmost antiphase oscillation in the intensity of the first two\nvalence band features of C60 was observed by Benning and\nco-workers.1 Both these states have p-orbital character and\ndiffer only in parity and angular momentum, and it was sug-\ngested that the photoelectron final state retained molecular\ncharacter in the form of parity for energies as high as 120 eV\nabove the vacuum level. Subsequent calculations6\u20139 have\nsuggested that intramolecular interference effects may be the\ndominant factor in determining the measured intensities.\nSeveral similar models have been formulated which can be\nclassified in two groups, one in which the phase difference\nacross the molecule of the photoemission initial state is\ndeemed to be important,6\u20138 the other in which scattering of\nthe final state wave function by the molecule9 determines\nintensity in a similar fashion. In both types of model a stand-\ning wavefield within the spherically symmetric \u2018\u2018shell\u2019\u2019 of a\nfullerene is created. In the initial state model this arises from\ninterference of a coherent spherically symmetric wave emit-\nted from the shell itself, while for a final state model scatter-\ning of a photoelectron from the quasi-spherically arranged\natoms of the shell produces the standing wave\u2014effectively\nphotoelectron diffraction. Consequently, in the first group of\nmodels increasing localization of the initial state wavefunc-\ntion should have a profound, and destructive, effect upon the\nintensity variation with incident photon energy. For the sec-\nond type of model localization of the initial state will have\nlittle, if any, effect on the observed oscillations in photoemis-\nsion intensity.\nAzafullerene,10 in which one carbon atom on C60 is sub-\nstituted by a nitrogen atom, offers a unique opportunity to\nprobe these effects of localization of the initial state in the\nphotoemission process. The azafullerenyl radical C59N\" can\nbe stabilized by reacting with hydrogen to form C59HN,11 by\nbonding to a semiconductor12 or a metal13 surface or by\nforming dimers. (C59N)2 is stable in solution as well as in\nthe solid phase where the dimers arrange in a monoclinic\nlattice.14 It is the dimerization in the solid phase which leads\nto the localization of the highest unoccupied molecular or-\nbital ~HOMO!.15,16\nWe explored intensity oscillations in the valence band of\nsolid (C59N)2 at the I311 undulator beamline17 at the MAX\nII storage ring at MAX-lab in Lund, Sweden which was\nequipped with a modified SX-700 monochromator and a\nhemispherical SCIENTA SES 200 analyzer. The spectra were\nrecorded at 96 K with a total (photons1electrons) energy\nresolution of 45 meV as determined from the width of the\nFermi edge of the graphite substrate, measured at 96 K after\ncleaving in air and repeated heating under ultra high vacuum\nto bright orange glow to remove contaminants. C59N was\nsynthesized and purified as described in Ref. 10. From IR\nmeasurements a C60 contamination of less than 1% was de-\nduced for this material.18 (C59N)2 multilayer films were de-\nposited in situ by sublimation from a boron nitride crucible\nonto the clean graphite ~0001! kept at room temperature.\nDeposition at this temperature favours island growth as evi-\ndenced by the fact that the graphite Fermi edge was still\nvisible when more than a nominal two monolayers of\nazafullerene were deposited. C60 multilayer films were pro-\nduced the same way but using commercially available mate-\nrial ~99.9% purity, MER Corporation! evaporated from a re-\nsistively heated Ta crucible. The pressure in the UHV\nchamber rose from 2310210 mbar to the low 1028 mbar\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 66, 193404 ~2002!\n0163-1829\/2002\/66~19!\/193404~4!\/$20.00 \u00a92002 The American Physical Society66 193404-1\nrange during fullerene deposition. The cleanliness of the\nfilms was verified using core level photoemission.\nFigure 1 shows a typical valence band photoemission\nspectrum from a film of (C59N)2 on graphite ~0001!. The\noverall shape of the spectrum is somewhat similar to that of\na C60 multilayer, with key differences associated with the\npresence of extra states from the substitutional doping with\nnitrogen, and the distortion of the monomer cages brought\nabout by both substitution and dimerization.15,16 The HOMO\nof the (C59N)2 dimer ~Fig. 1, peak A! has a high degree of\nN2p character and lies above the C2p-dominated states\nwhich would form the HOMO of pure C60 ~Fig. 1, peak B!.\nCalculations demonstrate that the (C59N)2 HOMO is spa-\ntially localized on the dimer in the region of the intermolecu-\nlar dimer bond and on the adjacent nitrogen atom,15 while\nthe HOMO-1 ~peak B! is more delocalized.\nPhotoemission spectra as a function of photon energy are\nshown in Fig. 2. A similar variation with photon energy has\nbeen observed by Jones et al.4 However, only the first 5 eV\nof the valence band was reported in that work. Consequently,\nwhen the HOMO intensity was extracted by fitting it was\nnormalized to the intensity of either peak B or C. Both peaks\nB and C undergo considerable intensity variations. Thus, the\nobserved variation in the normalized intensity of the HOMO\ndepended quite strongly upon the peak chosen for normaliza-\ntion. To eliminate these problems we have adopted a more\nrigorous normalization and fitting procedure. Spectra were\ntaken over the binding energy range 12 to 21 eV. A residual\nsignal from the graphite substrate, close to EF was used to\ncalibrate energy positions. In contrast to Ref. 4, no change in\nposition of the valence band features was found with energy.\nSpectra were normalized to the total integrated spectral in-\ntensity over the binding energy range acquired. To ensure\nthat the normalization procedure was sufficiently robust,\nspectra were also normalized to the incident photon flux and\nthe final results of the normalization and fitting procedure\nfound to be almost identical. The graphite background, nor-\nmalized to the intensity near EF was then subtracted from\nour spectra. Initial parameters for fitting were determined as\nfollows: a valence band spectrum of multilayer C60 was ob-\ntained during the same beamtime under the same conditions\nas those for (C59N)2 . A difference spectrum was then gen-\nerated for hn545 eV by subtracting the spectrum of\nmultilayer C60 the from that of (C59N)2 , Fig. 3. The differ-\nence spectrum should reflect the additional density of va-\nlence band states associated with substitution of nitrogen into\nthe fullerene cage and subsequent dimerization. Indeed, the\nresulting spectrum shows strong similarity to the N partial\ndensity of states ~N-PDOS! of Ref. 15 formed by projecting\nthe one electron states onto the nitrogen atomic functions.\nAlthough the difference spectrum contains intensity arising\nfrom the reduction in molecular symmetry and consequent\nbroadening of other states, to a first approximation the lead-\ning feature is representative of the (C59N)2 HOMO. The dif-\nference spectrum was then fitted by a combination of three\nGaussian functions ~two singlets, one doublet! consistent\nwith the theoretical N-PDOS ~Ref. 15! as shown in Fig. 3.\nFIG. 1. Valence band spectrum of (C59N)2 obtained in normal\nemission geometry at a photon energy of 35 eV. The contribution\nfrom the graphite substrate is shown by the dotted line.\nFIG. 2. Valence band spectra of (C59N)2 \/HOPG showing oscil-\nlatory behavior of photoemission intensity as a function of photon\nenergy. For a description of the normalization procedure see text.\nAll spectra were obtained in normal emission geometry.\nFIG. 3. Difference spectrum between the valence bands of C60\nand (C59N)2 obtained at a photon energy of 45 eV ~solid circles!.\nThe fit to the difference spectrum, shown as solid lines, was subse-\nquently used as the basis of fits to the (C59N)2 valence band spectra\nas a function of photon energy, as described in the text.\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 66, 193404 ~2002!\n193404-2\nThe normalized (C59N)2 spectra were then fitted with the\nsum of these functions and a pair of Gaussians obtained by\nfitting the leading features of the C60 valence band. Positions\nand intensities ~including relative intensities in the doublet!\nwere allowed to relax, but the relative positions and widths\nof the peaks generated by the difference spectrum were fixed.\nFigure 4 illustrates the high quality of typical fits resulting\nfrom this approach. It was found that extending the fit to\ninclude higher binding energy peaks did not lead to any sig-\nnificant changes in the intensities associated with the leading\nedge features. From these fits one can extract normalized\nareas associated with each of the peaks, which are plotted in\nFig. 5. It is clearly seen that the areas of the peaks corre-\nsponding to the maxima A, B, and C ~Fig. 1! display oscil-\nlatory intensity superposed on a decreasing background\nwhich arises from a reduction in the photoemission cross-\nsection of p-orbital derived states with respect to the s-orbital\nderived states which play an important role in normalization.\nAlthough some small contribution to the oscillatory intensity\nobserved in peak A may arise from overlap with peak B, the\ndifference in the variation of the intensity of these peaks with\nphoton energy is sufficient to draw the conclusion that the\nintensity of peak A varies nonmonotonically with photon en-\nergy. The presence of oscillations in the cross section of the\n(C59N)2 HOMO contradicts the assertion in Ref. 4 that no\nsuch oscillation could be detected.\nIf initial state effects are dominant in inducing the ob-\nserved intensity oscillations6\u20138 then it can be expected that\nthese would vanish if the initial state were spatially localized\nrather than distributed over the entire cage of a fullerene\nmonomer or over the complete dimer. The continued pres-\nence of intensity oscillations for the (C59N)2 HOMO, which\nis rather localized within the dimer,15,16 indicates that inter-\nference effects associated with the passage of the photoelec-\ntron out of the molecules is primarily responsible for the\nintensity oscillations. Thus we can draw the conclusion that\nit is the scattering of the outgoing photoelectron from the\nquasispherical monomer components of the (C59N)2 dimer,\nand resulting interference effects which lead to the intensity\noscillations observed as a function of photon energy for a\nnumber of fullerenes and fullerene derivatives.1\u20135,9\nThe authors would like to thank J.
