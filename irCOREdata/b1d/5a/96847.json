Introduction\nPlants exhibit great morphological plasticity in\ntheir response to the environment such as the\nnumber of neighbouring plants (i.e. population\ndensity). Plant height, for instance, increases (rela-\ntive to biomass, stem diameter and leaf area) as\npopulation density increases (e.g. Hara, 1984;\n* Corresponding author.

Such plasticity in plants was previously\nexplained by game theory (e.g. Givnish, 1982;\nIwasa et al., 1984; Givnish, 1986; Sakai, 1991).\nIncreasing experimental evidence also shows that\nsuch plastic responses of plants to com-\npetitive environments are physiologically phy-\ntochrome-mediated and can confer plants\u2019 ability\nto forage for light, and thus are adaptive (see\nreviews by Schmitt and Wulff, 1993 and Smith,\n1994).\nIn our preceding papers (Sekimura, 1993, 1995,\n1997), we quantitatively estimated the solar radia-\ntion flux captured by leaves of model plants and\ndiscussed the diversity in shoot morphology of\nherbs. In this paper, we consider the density effect\non shoot morphology of herbs through numerical\ncalculations of the flux which take account of\nboth self-shading of a model plant and \u2018alien\u2019-\nshading from neighbouring plants. Optimisation\ntheory is used to obtain optimal shoot morphol-\nogy in relation to maximal light capture under the\ntrade-offs of resource partition among leaves,\nstems and veins. The model is formulated and\nanalysed in Section 2, and the optimisation\nresults are presented in Section 3. Section 4 con-\ntains a full discussion of the significance of our\nresults.\n2. The model\n2.1. Basic assumptions in model simulations\nModel plants have a single vertical stem with\nhorizontally oriented leaves and stand at regular\nintervals along a straight line (Fig. 1).\nWe assume that the sun rises in the east and\nsets in the west after passing overhead within a\ncertain timeframe (e.g. 12 h).\nLight shading for a leaf in question comes from\nboth the upper leaf at the same phyllotactic posi-\ntion of the plant and upper leaves at the same\nposition of both its right and left neighbouring\nplants. When the distance between two neigh-\nbouring plants is very small, the leaf overlap is\ntreated in such a way as to exclude double count-\ning of light shading (see Section 2.2.2 for details).\nThe internodal length of the stem and leaf shape\nare designed to maximise\n1. the flux of solar radiation captured by leaves\nand\n2. the utilisation efficiency of resources.\nLeaf area and internodal length of a plant are\nconstrained by the trade-offs of resource partition\namong leaves, stems, and veins, so as to maximise\nthe solar radiation flux per leaf per day.\n2.2. Solar radiation flux captured by lea6es\nThe solar radiation flux per leaf per day, N, is\nevaluated by the following equation:\nN\u001e\n& t1\nt 0\nI0(S\u001cS %0) sin udt (1)\nwhere t0 and t1 are the times at which the sun rises\nand sets, respectively; I0 is the incident solar flux\nper unit leaf area per unit time. u is the elevation\nangle of the sun measured from the plant, and S\nis the surface area of a leaf in question, which is\neasily calculated if the leaf outline is given by a\nmathematical function (Eq. (A1), Appendix A).\nS %u is the shaded area on the leaf at sun elevation\nu, which is a function of time t, distance H\nbetween two neighbouring stems, internodal\nlength D of the stem between two leaves at the\nsame phyllotactic position,\nS %u\u001eS %(t,H,D) (2)\nFig. 1. Model plants with vertical stems standing at regular\nintervals on a straight line. The parameters L, D, and H are\nleaf lamina length, the internodal length of the stem between\ntwo leaves at the same phyllotactic position, and the distance\nbetween two neighbouring plants, respectively.\nT. Sekimura et al. : Ecological Modelling 128 (2000) 51\u201362 53\nFig. 2. Self-shading of light for a leaf in question from the\nupper leaf at the same phyllotactic position. u is the elevation\nangle of the sun measured from the plant. j is the distance\nbetween the stem and the tip of the shadow on the leaf. D is\nthe internodal distance of the stem between two leaves at the\nsame position.\nthe lower leaf measured from the stem, j, is given\nby\nj\u001eD: tan (u)\nwhere u is the elevation angle of the sun measured\nfrom the plant. During the time:angle interval in\nwhich the condition 05j5L (leaf lamina length)\nholds, the leaf is shaded by the upper leaf (see\nAppendix B for more details).\n2.2.2. Light shading from upper lea6es of three\nplants including both right and left neighbours\nWe consider light shading from three upper\nleaves of three plants including both its right and\nleft neighbouring plants. The shading area to be\nestimated is the area on the lower leaf of the\nmiddle plant (b) of the three plants (a), (b), (c) in\nFig. 3, which stand at regular intervals H on a\nstraight line. We have assumed the origin of x\nco-ordinates to be the stem position of the middle\nplant (b). As shown in Fig. 3, jb is the position of\nthe tip of the shadow of the upper leaf of plant (b)\nmeasured from the origin. We express the position\nof the tip of the shadow of the upper leaf of plant\n(a) on the lower leaf\u2019s plane of plant (b), by\nja\u001eH\u001bD: tan (u). jc represents the position of\nthe tip of the shadow from the upper leaf of plant\n(c) on the lower leaf\u2019s plane of plant (b):\njc\u001eH\u001bD: tan (u).\nThe shading area S %u on the lower leaf of plant\n(b) is expressed as follows:\nS %u\u001eS %0\u001bS %a\u001bS %b\u001bS %c\u001cS %ab\u001cS %0abc\u001cS %bc (3)\nwhere S %0 is the shade from the lower leaf of plant\n(a); S %a, S %b, S %c are shades from the upper leaves of\nplants (a), (b), (c), respectively; S %ab is the intersec-\ntion of shades S %a and S %b; S %0abc is the intersection\nof shades S %0, S %a, S %b, and S %c; S %bc is the intersec-\ntion of shades S %b and S %c. When overlap between\nlower leaves of neighbouring plants occurs, that\nis, when the condition HBL holds, it is reason-\nable to assume that the lower leaf of plant (a) is\nplaced on the lower leaf of the middle plant (b),\nwhereas the lower leaf of plant (c) is placed under\nthe middle one. When no overlap between leaves\noccurs, Eq. (3) can be simplified to the following\nexpression (see Appendix B for more details):\nS %u\u001eS %a\u001bS %b\u001bS %c (4)\nFig. 3. Light shading from leaves including both right and left\nneighbouring plants. Symbols as in Fig. 2.\nGenerally, S %u is not a simple mathematical\nfunction even if the leaf outline is given by a\nsimple mathematical function. We therefore con-\nsider shading on a leaf for the following cases.\n2.2.1. Light shading from an upper leaf at the\nsame phyllotactic position\nWe firstly present the basic idea of how to\ncalculate the solar radiation flux on a leaf lamina.\nSelf-shading of light for the lower leaf in question\nis assumed to come from an upper leaf at the\nsame phyllotactic position (Fig. 2). The position\nof the tip of the shadow cast by the upper leaf on\nT. Sekimura et al. : Ecological Modelling 128 (2000) 51\u20136254\n2.3. Optimisation theory\nWe consider the trade-offs of resource partition\namong leaves, stem, and veins of a plant, under\nthe following conditions:\nX\u001bY\u001bZ\u001eR (5)\nX\u001esS(L,W); Y\u001er1V1(D,r1); and Z\u001er2V2(L,r2)\n(6)\nwhere X, Y and Z are the fractions of resource R\nallocated to leaf lamina, stem, and vein, respec-\ntively. Parameters s, r1, and r2 represent actual\npartition coefficients of resource to leaf lamina,\nstem, and vein, respectively. S denotes the leaf\narea in question, which is a function of leaf\nlamina length L and width W (cf. Eq. (A2)); V1 is\nthe volume of the stem between two leaf laminae\nlocated at the same position, and is a function of\nthe internodal length D and the stem radius r1;V2\nis the volume of a main vein, and is assumed to be\na function of leaf lamina length L and radius r2 of\nthe vein. The units of sS, r1V1 and r2V2 are\ntaken to be the same as that of the resource R,\nwhatever the unit of resource is.\nWhen the amount of total resource is constant,\nthat of the resource a plant can obtain, R, is\nassumed to be a function of plant population\ndensity, being inversely correlated with density.\nWhen plants are placed at regular intervals of\ndistance H, the population density is the recipro-\ncal of H. Hence we assume that the resource R is\nproportional to the interval H. For simplicity, we\nassume that the resource, R, is constant when the\ndistance between two plants is more than twice\nthe leaf lamina length L.\n3. Results\nFor convenience, we normalise distance (H),\ninternodal length (D), and leaf lamina width (W)\nby leaf lamina length L to obtain H(\u001eH:L),\nD(\u001eD:L), and W(\u001eW:L). We also normalize\nthe resource (R) by the parameter s to give\nR(\u001eR:s).\n3.1. Flux including shading from neighbouring\nplants\nThe flux per unit leaf area per day is shown in\nFig. 4, in which both self-shading of the plant in\nFig. 4. Solar radiation flux per unit leaf area per day, in which self-shading is included in the estimation as well as shading from\nboth neighbouring plants, one on each side. Values of the flux, FLX(%), are normalised by dividing them by the flux value for a\nnon-shaded leaf. H(\u001eH:L) is the normalised distance between two neighbouring plants divided by leaf lamina length L. D(\u001eD:L)\nis the normalised internodal length of the stem of a single plant, divided by L. The optimal pathway on the surface of the flux is\nalso given. The closed circles connected by solid lines correspond to the case of leaf lamina width W\u001e0.30.\nT. Sekimura et al. : Ecological Modelling 128 (2000) 51\u201362 55\nFig. 5. Solar radiation flux per unit leaf area per day, in which only light shading from both the right and the left neighbours is\nestimated without self-shading of the plant. Values of the flux FLX(%) are normalised by dividing them by the flux value for a\nnon-shaded leaf. H(\u001eH:L) is the normalised distance between two neighbouring plants divided by leaf lamina length L. D(\u001eD:L)\nis the normalised internodal length of the stem of a single plant, divided by L.\nquestion and alien-shading from neighbouring\nplants, one on either side, are taken into account.\nIn Fig. 5, we show the flux from the neighbouring\nplants in the case of no self-shading. We nor-\nmalised the values of the flux, FLX(%), by divid-\ning them by the flux value for a non-shaded leaf.\nIt can be clearly seen that the flux, FLX(%),\ndecreases rapidly over the range 1.0\u20132.5 of the\ninternodal distance D and the range 2.0\u20133.0 for\nthe distance between two plants H. Our analysis\nshows that the decrease in flux reflects the geomet-\nrical coincidence between leaf position on the\nstem and stem positions of two neighbouring\nplants, in relation to light shading. This affects the\nchange in the flux in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, where both\nself-shading and alien-shading from both side\nplants are considered.\n3.2. Flux under the trade-offs of resource\npartition among the organs\nThe relationship between the flux FLX(%), H\nand W is shown in Fig. 6. The flux FLX(%) was\ncalculated according to optimisation theory under\nthe trade-offs of resource partition, in which self-\nshading, together with alien-shading from neigh-\nbouring plants is considered. It can be clearly seen\nfrom Fig. 6 that a rapid decrease in the flux\nFLX(%) from 60 to 0% occurs over a small range\nof the inter-plant distance around H\u001e0.5. The\nvalue H\u001e0.5 is the distance between two neigh-\nbouring plants at which two leaves at the same\nposition of both plants overlap by half. The de-\ncrease in the flux results in a corresponding in-\ncrease in the internodal length D between two\nleaves of the plant as a theoretical result of the\nassumption that the flux per leaf per day is to be\nmaximised (see Fig. 7 in the following section).\n3.3. Relationship between the optimal internodal\nlength and plant population density\nFig. 7 shows that the optimal internodal length,\nD, decreases with an increase in the distance\nbetween two neighbouring plants, H, with respect\nto the maximal light capture constrained by con-\nT.

It can be seen from Fig. 7 that\nthe internodal length D increases with leaf lamina\nwidth W when the distance H decreases to zero.\nOur predictions agree well with the experimental\nresults shown in Table 1. Sekiyama et al. (1984a)\ncarried out a field experiment with soybean (Glycine\nmax variety Tamanishiki) at a range of densities to\ninvestigate effects of plant population density on\nyield. From Table 1 of Sekiyama et al. (1984a), we\nrecalculated the distance between neighbouring\nplants and internodal lengths of the main stem at\nmaturity (125 days after sowing). We see that the\ninternodal length decreased with an increase in the\ndistance between neighbouring plants, namely, the\ninternodal length increased with plant population\ndensity (Table 1). This pattern held from about 50\ndays after sowing onwards (Sekiyama, Kuroiwa\nand Hara, unpublished data). Therefore, the theo-\nretical predictions in Fig. 7 agree well with the\nexperimental data in Table 1. Sekiyama et al.\n(1984b) repeated a similar yield-density experiment\nwith two soybean varieties (G. max variety Taman-\nishiki and G. max variety Tamahomare) in 1983.\nRecalculation from their 1983 results also showed\nthe same pattern as in Table 1. We can see the same\nrelationship between internodal length and distance\nbetween neighbouring plants also in the experimen-\ntal results with sunflower (Helianthus annuus) of\nKobayashi (1975).\nWe note that over the range of HB0.5, a rapid\nincrease in the optimal distance D can be seen,\nwhich is inversely related to the value of the flux\nin Fig. 6. It might be possible to define a critical\ndistance \u2018Hc \u2019 between two neighbouring plants, at\nwhich dramatic changes in both the flux and the\ninternodal length of the stem are expected.\nThe optimal pathway on the surface of the flux\nis given also in Fig. 4 in the two parameter (H, D)\ndomain for the case of Fig. 6 where the leaf lamina\nwidth W\u001e0.30.\n3.4. Relationship between optimal leaf length and\nplant population density\nFig. 8 shows the relationship between the optimal\nleaf length, L, and the distance between neighbour-\ning plants, H, for a range of values of leaf lamina\nwidth W. Fig. 8 corresponds to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7\nbecause both the figures were calculated simulta-\nneously with the same parameter values (i.e. leaf\nlamina width W and resource R). Fig. 8 also shows\nthat the optimal leaf length L increases with de-\ncreasing leaf lamina width W.\n4. Discussion\nWe theoretically analysed the effect of popula-\ntion density on shoot morphology of herbs in\nrelation to light capture by leaves. Using optimisa-\nT. Sekimura et al. : Ecological Modelling 128 (2000) 51\u20136258\ntion theory, we were able to obtain the optimal\nshoot morphology which gives the maximal solar\nradiation flux per leaf per day under the trade-offs\nof resource partition among leaves, stems and\nveins.\nOur model here focuses on the qualitative,\nrather than quantitative, nature of morphological\nchanges within plants. We have shown, however,\nthat this simple model can explain a variety of\nobserved phenomena. The model framework de-\nveloped in this paper can be further extended to\ninvestigate the effects of factors ignored in the\npresent model.\nFor convenience, we assumed that the model\nplant has a single vertical stem. This is not, of\ncourse, always the case in reality. Our model for\nplants with an erect stem can also be applicable to\nherbs of different growth forms such as stemless\nor prostrate species. Generally, our model predicts\nthat plants extend or equivalently invest more\nbiomass in their supporting organs to maximise\ntheir light capture as plant population density\nincreases. More specifically, while erect herbs in-\ncrease their internodal length in response to the\npresence of neighbours or simulated competition\n(i.e. reduced red:far-red ratio), prostrate species\nadjust the length of petioles and stemless herbs\nwould invest more biomass in their supporting\norgans (e.g. extended hypocotyl or petiole). These\nare supported strongly by existing experimental\nevidence (e.g. Ballare\u00b4 et al., 1988, 1990; Dale and\nCauston, 1992; Huber, 1997) and also by our\nexperimental results obtained from two Brassica\ncampestris varieties, cabbage and turnip (B. Li, J.\nSuzuki and T. Hara, unpublished data). They\ngrew the two varieties at a wide range of densities\nand performed four consecutive harvests. It was\nobserved that cabbage allocated a higher fraction\nof its biomass to its extended hypocotyl at higher\ndensities, whilst turnip increased its biomass allo-\ncation to its petioles with increasing density (Fig.\n9). The consequences of the morphological\nchanges through increasing biomass allocation to\nthe supporting organs are also to maximise their\nlight capture. It is worth whilte to note that to\nincrease the length of hypocotyl or petiole is the\nonly way for these stemless plants to maximise\ntheir light capture. We can therefore draw a gen-\neral conclusion that plants are able to find their\nways of maximising their light capture in compet-\nitive environments at high densities by increasing\neither internodal length, hypocotyl or petiole.\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, morphologi-\ncal plasticity in response to competition for light\nhas a physiological basis. Plants actually have\ninformation-acquiring systems that can detect and\n\u2018sense\u2019 the presence of neighbours by using phy-\ntochrome (Smith, 1982, 1994; Schmitt and Wulff,\n1993; Aphalo and Ballare, 1995). When popula-\ntion density increases, mutual shading inevitably\noccurs, which leads to reduced light quantity and\nred:far-red ratio (an indicator of light quality).\nPhytochrome acts to detect mutual shading\nthrough the changed quality of natural radiation,\nand to redirect development appropriately\n(Holmes and Smith, 1975; Morgan and Smith,\n1976; Smith, 1995). Plants can, through phy-\ntochrome-mediated photomorphogenesis, respond\nto both competitive (at high population density)\nand simulated-competition (through reduced red:\nfar-red ratio) environments by increasing stem\nextension (Morgan and Smith, 1976; Ballare\u00b4 et al.,\n1990; Dale and Causton, 1992), internode elonga-\ntion (Smith, 1982; Ballare\u00b4 et al., 1988; Davis and\nSimmons, 1994; Huber, 1997) and petiole length\nFig. 8. Relationship between optimal leaf length L, the dis-\ntance H between two neighbouring plants, and leaf lamina\nwidth W. This figure corresponds to Figs. 6 and 7 because\nboth the figures were calculated simultaneously with the same\nparameter values (i.e. leaf lamina width W and resource value\nR). H and W are normalised as in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.\nT. Sekimura et al. : Ecological Modelling 128 (2000) 51\u201362 59\nFig. 9. Effects of plant population density on the fraction of\ntotal biomass allocated to the extended hypocotyl of cabbage\n(A) and petiole of turnip (B) at 30 (\u000e), 60 (\t), 90 (\r) and\n120 (\n) days after emergence. The vertical bars represent\nstandard errors (from unpublished data by B. Li, J. Suzuki\nand T. Hara).\nThe plants in our model have a stem with\nhorizontally oriented leaves, while leaves of real\nplants are attached to the stem with some leaf\ndeflection angle. This assumption can be replaced\nby a more realistic assumption when we have\nsystematic and accurate experimental data with\nwhich to compare model results.\nIn this study, we focused on the shoot morphol-\nogy of a single plant. Other studies have focused\non the global:overall pattern of plant communi-\nties. For example, it was reported that protonemal\ncolonies of the moss Scopelophila cataractae show\nwave-like patterns in relation to light capture\n(Takenaka and Satake, 1991).\nPlants change their shapes considerably to\nadapt themselves to changing environments. The\nphenotypic plasticity of plants and the rigidity of\ngenes seem to generate and stabilise the diversity\nof plant forms. In order to fully understand this\ndiversity, it is necessary to consider plants from a\ncomprehensive view including ontogeny, genetics,\necology, evolution and physical conditions. Opti-\nmisation theory has been used mainly for mod-\nelling resource or ecosystem management (e.g.\nVan der Molen and Pinte\u00b4r, 1993; Stras\u02c7kraba,\n1994; Ha\u02dakanson, 1995; Tiwari et al., 1996;\nWilliams, 1996). Our paper illustrates how optimi-\nsation theory can be used for the analysis of\nplasticity in shoot morphology of plants in re-\nsponse to environmental changes, as well as the\nanalysis of diversity in morphology. Our\nmodel based on optimisation theory gives a basis\nfor the study of the effects of environmental\nchanges on plant morphology and plant commu-\nnity diversity in a local area and will be\nfurther extended to global terrestrial ecosystem\nmodels (cf. J\u00f8rgensen, 1997a,b; Mu\u00a8ller, 1997) by\nincorporating latitudinal change in the sun eleva-\ntion.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dr S. Sakai for valuable comments\non the manuscript.

Therefore, a generalisation\ncan be reached that plants can, in response to\ncanopy shade due to competition at high popula-\ntion density, increase their potential for light cap-\nture by increasing vertical growth or horizontal\nspread (depending on their growth forms). More-\nover, a suite of morphological traits conferring\nplants\u2019 ability to forage for light can also be\nexpected in plants that are well adapted to long-\nterm shaded habitats.\nT.

Shading from upper lea6es of neighbouring\nplants\nBy extending the previous case in Section B.1 and\nconsidering the shading from an upper leaf of\nanother plant at the same phyllotactic position, the\nshaded area can be calculated in a similar way. We\nconsider three plants (a), (b), (c), which stand at\nregular intervals H (from left to right) on a straight\nline (Fig. 3).
