POWER\nMathematics and Statistics Department, Lancaster University\n(Received 7 August 1995)\nAbstract\nThe Fourier binest algebra is de\fned as the intersection of the Volterra nest al-\ngebra on L2(R) with its conjugate by the Fourier transform. Despite the absence of\nnonzero \fnite rank operators this algebra is equal to the closure in the weak oper-\nator topology of the Hilbert{Schmidt bianalytic pseudo-differential operators. The\n(non-distributive) invariant subspace lattice is determined as an augmentation of the\nVolterra and analytic nests (the Fourier binest) by a continuum of nests associated\nwith the unimodular functions exp(\u2212isx2=2) for s > 0. This multinest is the reflex-\nive closure of the Fourier binest and, as a topological space with the weak operator\ntopology, it is shown to be homeomorphic to the unit disc. Using this identi\fcation\nthe unitary automorphism group of the algebra is determined as the semi-direct\nproduct R2 \u0002\u0014 R for the action \u0014t(\u0015; \u0016) = (et\u0015; e\u2212t\u0016):\nA nest algebra is an algebra of operators on a complex Hilbert space consisting\nof all the bounded operators which leave invariant each subspace in a given chain\nof subspaces of the Hilbert space. In the present paper we write Nv for the Volterra\nnest in L2(R) consisting of the subspaces L2([\u0015;1)), for \u0015 2 R, together with f0g and\nL2(R), and we refer to the associated nest algebra Av as the Volterra nest algebra on\nL2(R). To de\fne the Fourier binest algebra we also require what we refer to as the\nanalytic nest Na which consists of f0g, L2(R) and the chain of subspaces eisxH2(R),\nfor s 2 R, where H2(R) is the usual Hardy space of boundary functions for the upper\nhalf plane. The Fourier binest is the subspace lattice\nL = Nv xNa\nand the Fourier binest algebra A is the non-self-adjoint algebra of operators which\nleave invariant each subspace of L. Plainly A = Av wAa, where Aa is the nest\nalgebra for the analytic nest Na.\nFor the last 30 years, since their consideration by Ringrose, nest algebras have\nbeen studied intensely from a great many viewpoints. The monograph of Davidson\n[4] gives a survey of much of this theory. Their importance, even in \fnite-dimensions,\nlies in the fact that they provide the most fundamental class of noncommutative non-\nself-adjoint operator algebras. In the present paper, by focusing on perhaps the most\n526 A. Katavolos and S. C. Power\nnatural continuous multiplicity one example, we initiate a study of binest algebras,\nby which we mean, simply, those algebras that are the intersection of two nest alge-\nbras. As we shall see, the Fourier binest algebra is intimately involved with analytic\nfunction theory and can be characterized in terms of the Weyl relations. Further-\nmore its naturalness is expressed by its intrinsic description as the weakly closed\noperator algebra generated by the Hilbert{Schmidt bianalytic pseudo-differential\noperators.\nAmongst nest algebras the Volterra nest algebra plays a particularly distinguished\nrole. Indeed, an elementary result of Kadison and Singer [6] asserts that each contin-\nuous nest algebra of uniform multiplicity one, which is separably acting, is unitarily\nequivalent to Av. Whilst for binests there is no direct parallel to this uniqueness, the\nFourier binest algebra is nevertheless a distinguished example. In what follows we\nobtain the following three main results. The \frst is the intrinsic characterization in\nterms of pseudo-differential operators and the bianalytic Weyl algebra. The second\nresult, which depends on the \frst, determines the lattice of invariant subspaces of A\nas a topological disc with disjoint ordering from a foliation by lines of longitude. This\nin turn enables the determination of the unitary automorphism group of A as the\nsemi-direct product R2 \u0002\u0014 R for the action \u0014t(\u0015; \u0016) = (et\u0015; e\u2212t\u0016): That the unitary\nautomorphism group is an elementary Lie group is in stark contrast to the situation\nfor nest algebras themselves and is another reflection of the bianalytic nature of A.\nIt will be convenient to de\fne a pseudo-differential operator on L2(R) as an oper-\nator Op(a) such that\n(Op(a)f )(x) =\n1p\n2\u0019\nZ 1\n\u22121\na(x; y)e\u2212ixy ~f (y)dy;\nwhere ~f is the inverse Fourier transform of f 2 L2(R) and where a(x; y), the symbol\nof Op(a), is a suitable function determining Op(a) as a bounded linear operator.\n(This is not quite the usual de\fnition (cf. [3, 10]) in that the roles of F and F \u0003\nhave been exchanged.) If Op(a) is a Hilbert{Schmidt operator then the function\na(x; y) is necesssarily in L2(R2). Conversely, if a(x; y) is such a function then Op(a)\ncan be de\fned and the result is a Hilbert{Schmidt operator. It will be shown that\nthe Fourier binest algebra is the weakly closed linear span of the Hilbert{Schmidt\noperators Op(a) which are bianalytic in the sense that the symbols a(x; y) belong to\nthe subspace H2(R)\u2297H2(R) of L2(R2):\nIn the theory of nest algebras the \fnite rank operators often play a vital role. The\nFourier binest algebra on the other hand contains no \fnite rank operators, other\nthan zero. We expect that the operators above may nevertheless prove to be a useful\nsubstitute.\nAnother main tool in the study of nest algebras (and, more generally, CSL algebras)\nis the presence of selfadjoint operators and projections. By contrast, the Fourier\nbinest algebra is antisymmetric in the sense that it contains no selfadjoint operators,\nother than scalar multiples of the identity.\nThe binest algebra A is the intersection of two reflexive algebras and so is a\nreflexive algebra. That is, with the usual notation, A = Alg(Lat A). However the\nbinest L itself is not reflexive as a subspace lattice. Nevertheless we can identify\nits reflexive closure Lat(AlgL), the lattice of invariant subspaces of A. Curiously,\nas we alluded above, it turns out that Lat A, with the natural compact Hausdorff\nThe Fourier binest algebra 527\ntopology, is homeomorphic to the unit disc. As a set Lat A consists of Nv and Na,\nforming the topological boundary of Lat A, together with a continuum of nests Ns,\nindexed by a positive real parameter s, given by\nNs = f\u001esK: K 2Nag;\nwhere \u001es is the function \u001es(x) = e\u2212isx\n2=2. The order structure of Lat A is that\nof a multinest consisting of uncountably many copies of the partially ordered set\n[0; 1] with the minimal points identi\fed and the maximal points identi\fed. Thus the\nsupremum and in\fmum of proper elements of distinct nests are L2(R) and the zero\nsubspace respectively.\nWe would like to thank Donald Sarason for the succinct cocycle argument used\nin the proof of Theorem 3\u00011. The characterization there of the closed subspaces of\nL2(R) which are simply invariant for the translation and multiplication semigroups\nalso seems to be of some independent interest.\n1. Preliminaries\nWe begin by setting out some useful terminology and notation and by recalling\nsome well-known facts from the theory of Hardy spaces.\nThe Fourier{Plancherel transform is the unitary operator F on L2(R) which is the\nisometric extension of the linear operator on L2(R) w L1(R) given by\n(Ff )(x) =\n1p\n2\u0019\nZ 1\n\u22121\ne\u2212ixyf (y)dy:\nAlternatively we can view Ff as the k \u0001k2-limit of the sequence of functions given by\nintegration over the intervals [\u2212n; n]; for n = 1; 2; : : : . The Paley{Wiener theorem\nimplies that F (H2(R)) = L2([0;1)) and from this it follows that FP0F \u0003 = Q0 where\nP0 and Q0 are the orthogonal projection onto H2(R) and L2([0;1)) respectively. The\nadjoint of F is similarly de\fned, with eixy in place of e\u2212ixy. One can verify directly\nthat F 2 is the symmetry induced by the reflection x! \u2212x.\nLet M\u0015, \u0015 2 R, be the operator of multiplication by the exponential function\nei\u0015x on L2(R). Then FM\u0015F \u0003 coincides with the translation unitary D\u0015 given by\n(D\u0015f )(y) = f (y \u2212 \u0015); y 2 R. In particular we have\nNv = fD\u0015L2([0;1)): \u22121 < \u0015 < +1g x f0; L2(R)g;\nNa = fM\u0015H2(R): \u22121 < \u0015 < +1g x f0; L2(R)g:\nSince FM\u0015H2(R) = D\u0015FH2(R) = D\u0015L2([0;1)) we have FNa = Nv from which it\nfollows that FAaF \u0003 = Av. The set L = Nv xNa is a complete lattice and it is\nstraightforward to check that it has the order structure of a continuous binest.\nFor \u001e 2 L1(R), letM\u001e be the corresponding multiplication operator on L2(R), and\nwriteD\u001e for FM\u001eF \u0003. If \u0015 > 0 thenM\u0015 belongs to Aa and hence to the binest algebra\nA. Similarly, if s > 0 then Ds belongs to A. In particular if \u001e(x) and  (x) are each a\n\fnite linear combination of exponentials ei\u0016x, with \u0016 > 0, then M\u001eD is an operator\nin A. This product coincides with the bianalytic pseudo-differential operator Op(a)\nwith de\fning function a(x; y) = \u001e(x) (y). In view of the Weyl commutation relations\nM\u0015D\u0016 = ei\u0015\u0016D\u0016M\u0015; for \u0015; \u0016 in R;\n528 A. Katavolos and S. C. Power\nit follows that the linear span of these products is a complex operator algebra. This\nwe refer to as the bianalytic Weyl algebra. As is well-known, this particular subalgebra\nof A contains no compact operators. See, for example, Coburn and Douglas [2].\nMore generally, if \u001e;  2 H1(R) then M\u001e; D belong to A because A is closed in\nthe weak operator topology. If, additionally, \u001e and  are functions inH2(R)wH1(R)\nthenM\u001eD agrees with the pseudo-differential operator Op(a), and this has the form\n(Int k)F \u0003 where Int k is the Hilbert{Schmidt integral operator with kernel function\nk(x; y) with k(x; y) = a(x; y)e\u2212ixy=\np\n2\u0019 = \u001e(x) (y)e\u2212ixy=\np\n2\u0019. It follows that if a(x; y)\nbelongs to the subspace H2(R) \u2297H2(R) of L2(R2) then Op(a) is a Hilbert{Schmidt\noperator in A. In the next section we show, conversely, that all Hilbert{Schmidt\noperators in the Fourier binest algebra have this particular form.\nWe need the following well-known version of Beurling\u2019s theorem for invariant\nsubspaces of the shift which is due to Lax [7]. This may be obtained from the usual\nformulation for the disc by making use of the conformal equivalence with the upper\nhalf plane and the fact (already used in the last paragraph) that in the weak operator\ntopology the set fM\u0015: \u0015 > 0g has dense linear span in fM\u001e: \u001e 2 H1(R)g. We refer\nthe reader to Garnett [5] for the theory of inner functions.\nTheorem. Let K be a simply invariant subspace for the semigroup fM\u0015: \u0015 > 0g, so\nthat M\u0015K \u0012 K, for all \u0015 > 0, and \\\n\u0015>0\nM\u0015K = f0g:\nThen there is a unimodular function u in L1(R) such that K = uH2(R). In particular\nevery simply invariant subspace which is contained in the Hardy space H2(R) has the\nform uH2(R) for some inner function u in H1(R).\n2. Characterizations of A\nThe \frst main result of this section is the following density theorem.\nTheorem 2\u00011. The Fourier binest algebra A coincides with each of the following\nspaces.\n(i) The weak star closure of the bianalytic Weyl algebra.\n(ii) The weak star closed linear span of the products M\u001eD for \u001e;  2 H1.\n(iii) The weak star closure of the algebra of Hilbert{Schmidt bianalytic pseudo-\ndifferential operators.\nThat the weak star closures in (i) and (ii) coincide is an elementary consequence\nof the fact that the linear span of the analytic exponential functions is weak star\ndense in H1(R). Also, it is easy to see that these closures agree with the closure in\n(iii). Let B denote this closure. The proof will be completed by showing that B = A.\nThis follows immediately from the next two lemmas.\nLemma 2\u00012. Let A 2 A be a Hilbert{Schmidt operator. Then AF = Int k, where\nk 2 L2(R2) has the following properties.\n(i) For almost all y 2 R the function x! eixyk(x; y) is in H2(R).\n(ii) For almost all x 2 R the function y ! eixyk(x; y) is in H2(R).\nIn particular A = Op(a) where a 2 H2(R)\u2297H2(R).\nThe Fourier binest algebra 529\nProof. (i) There exists an element d in L2(R2), viewed as a function, such that\nA = Int d. Since A 2 Av we have A(L2([\u0015;1))) \u0012 L2([\u0015;1)) for all \u0015 2 R and so\nd(x; y) = 0 for almost all x < y. Rede\fning d on a set of two-dimensional Lebesgue\nmeasure zero, if necessary, we may assume that\nd(x; y) = 0 for all x < y: (1)\nThere exists a null set X \u0012 R such that the function y ! d(x; y) is in L2(R) for all\nx ^ X. For any \fxed x ^ X, de\fne\nkd(x; y) =\nZ 1\n\u22121\nd(x; t)e\u2212itydt: (2)\nMore precisely, kd(x; \u0001) is the k \u0001 k2 limit of the functions kn(x; \u0001) where\nkn(x; y) =\nZ n\n\u2212n\nd(x; t)e\u2212itydt =\nZ 1\n\u22121\nd(x; t)\u001fn(t)e\u2212itydt\nwhere \u001fn denotes the characteristic function of the interval [\u2212n; n]. Also,\neixykn(x; y) =\nZ 1\n\u22121\nd(x; t)\u001fn(t)ei(x\u2212t)ydt\n=\nZ 1\n\u22121\nd(x; x\u2212 s)\u001fn(x\u2212 s)eisyds\n=\nZ 1\n0\nd(x; x\u2212 s)\u001fn(x\u2212 s)eisyds\nby (1). Thus, by the Paley{Wiener theorem, the function y ! eixykn(x; y) is in\nH2(R) for all n 2 N. Since eix:kn(x; \u0001) converges to eix:kd(x; \u0001) in L2(R), it follows that\ny ! eixykd(x; y) is in H2(R) for all x ^ X.\n(ii) Let F \u0003AF = B = Int b. SinceA 2Aa we haveAM\u0015H2(R) \u0012M\u0015H2(R) for each\n\u0015 2 R. Equivalently AFL2((\u22121;\u2212\u0015]) \u0012 FL2((\u22121;\u2212\u0015]) and so F \u0003AFL2((\u22121;\u2212\u0015])\n\u0012 L2((\u22121;\u2212\u0015]). It follows that b(x; y) = 0 for almost all x > y. Rede\fning b we may\nassume that\nb(x; y) = 0 for all x > y: (3)\nAs in (i), there is a null set Y \u0012 R such that for any \fxed y ^ Y , we may de\fne\nkb(x; y) =\nZ 1\n\u22121\nb(t; y)e\u2212itxdt (4)\nin the usual sense. Then\neixykb(x; y) =\nZ 1\n\u22121\nb(t; y)eix(y\u2212t)dt\n=\nZ 1\n\u22121\nb(y \u2212 s; y)eisxds\n=\nZ 1\n0\nb(y \u2212 s; y)eisxds\nby (3). This implies, as in (i), that the function x ! eixykb(x; y) is in H2(R) for all\ny ^ Y .\n530 A. Katavolos and S. C. Power\nFinally, it follows from (2) that AF = Int kd, and from (4) that FB = Int kb. Since\nAF = FB, the kernels kd and kb must be equal almost everywhere. The existence\nof the desired function k follows routinely from this and the \fnal assertion follows\nfrom elementary functional analysis.\nLemma 2\u00013. The Hilbert{Schmidt operators in the Fourier binest algebra are dense in\nthe weak star topology.\nProof. Let hn(x) = ni=(x + ni) so that hn 2 H1(R), jhn(x)j 6 1 for all real x and\nhn(x)! 1 uniformly on compact sets. ThenMhn ! I andDhn ! I boundedly in the\nstrong operator topology from which it follows that the Hilbert{Schmidt products\nKn = MhnDhn , which are in A, tend to the identity in the strong operator topology\nas n!1. But now, if X is an operator in A then X is the strong operator topology\nlimit of the Hilbert{Schmidt operators XKn.\nRemarks. (i) Recall that ifR 2Av is of \fnite rank then the range ofR is contained\nin L2([t;1)) for some real t. Similarly, if R 2 Aa then its range is contained in\nMsH\n2(R) for some real s. By the F. and M. Riesz Theorem, the intersection of these\ntwo subspaces is trivial. It follows that the Fourier binest algebra contains no nonzero\n\fnite-rank operators.\n(ii) One can also see that the only selfadjoint operators in the binest algebra are\ntrivial ones. Indeed, if A = A\u0003 is in A, then the subspaces of the Volterra nest are\nreducing for A and so A is a multiplication operator Mf , where f is real-valued. But\nMf must also leave H2(R) invariant, hence f must be in H1(R) and so is a constant\nfunction. In other words, the binest algebra has trivial diagonal: A wA\u0003 = CI.\nThe next theorem gives abstract characterizations of the Fourier binest algebra,\nand also expresses the bianalytic character of A in a different sense.\nLet U = fU\u0015: \u0015 2 Rg be a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on a\nHilbert space H, and consider the spectral representation\nU\u0015 =\nZ\neit\u0015dPt:\nBy the spectral nest of U we will mean the complete nest N generated by fP?t : t 2 Rg.\nLoebl and Muhly have characterized the nest algebra Alg N as the set of all operators\nA 2 B(H) which are U-analytic in the sense that, if \u000b\u0015 = Ad(U\u0015) (where Ad(Z)\ndenotes the map X ! ZXZ\u0003), the function \u0015 ! trace(\u000b\u0015(A)X) is in H1(R) for all\ntrace class operators X. See theorem 4\u00012\u00013 of [8]. They also prove that every nest\nalgebra arises in this way.\nIt follows that if U1 = fU (1)\u0015 g and U2 = fU (2)\u0015 g are two such groups with spectral\nnests N1 and N2, then the algebra Alg(N1 xN2) coincides with the set of all\n(U1;U2)-bianalytic operators, that is, all A 2 B(H) such that the functions\n\u0015! trace (\u000b(1)\u0015 (A)X)\nand\n\u0016! trace (\u000b(2)\u0016 (A)X)\nare in H1(R) for all trace class operators X.\nNote that \u000b(2) acts trivially on N2: \u000b\n(2)\n\u0015 (P\n?\nt ) = P\n?\nt for all t and \u0015. We say below\nthat \u000b(2) acts transitively on some nest N1 if \u000b\n(2)\n\u0015 (N1) = N1 for all \u0015 2 R and if\nThe Fourier binest algebra 531\n\u000b(2)\u0015 (Q) \u0010 Q for all \u0015 \u0010 0 and all Q 2 N1; 0 \u0010 Q \u0010 I. In this situation (with\njust \u000b(2) and N1 given), it is shown in [1] that there exists a strongly continuous\none-parameter unitary group fU (1)\u0015 g, whose spectral nest is N1, such that the pair\nfU (1)\u0015 g; fU (2)\u0016 g satis\fes the Weyl relations U (1)\u0015 U (2)\u0016 = ei\u0015\u0016U (2)\u0016 U (1)\u0015 . Conversely, if a pair\nof unitary one-parameter groups satis\fes the Weyl relations, then each group acts\ntransitively on the spectral nest of the other. Let us call a pair (U1;U2) of strongly\ncontinuous one-parameter unitary groups satisfying the Weyl relations a Weyl pair.\nTheorem 2\u00014. For a set B of bounded operators on a Hilbert space H, the following\nare equivalent:\n(i) There exists n 2 f1; 1; 2; : : : g such that B is unitarily equivalent to A\u2297B(\u20182(n)).\n(ii) There exists a Weyl pair (U1;U2) with spectral nests N1 and N2 respectively,\nsuch that B = Alg(N1 xN2).\n(iii) There exists a Weyl pair (U1;U2) such that B consists of all (U(1);U(2))-bianalytic\noperators on H.\n(iv) There exists a Weyl pair (U1;U2) such that B is the weak star closed linear span of\nall products of the form U (1)\u0003\u0015 U\n(2)\n\u0016 A where \u0015 > 0; \u0016 > 0 and A 2 B(H) commutes\nwith both groups.\n(v) B = Alg(N1 xN2) where the nest N2 admits a transitive action by a unitary\none-parameter group whose spectral nest is N1.\nProof. Since the automorphism groups fAdU (1)\u0015 g and fAdU (2)\u0016 g commute (by the\nWeyl relations), the equivalence of (ii) and (iii) follows from the above observations.\nIf B = A\u2297B(\u20182(n)) then setting U (1)\u0015 = D\u0003\u0015\u2297 I and U (2)\u0016 = M\u0016\u2297 I, it is easy to see\nthat the spectral nest of U (1) is N1 = N(n)a = f(M\u0015H2(R))\u2297 \u20182(n) : \u22121 6 \u0015 6 +1g\nwhile that of U (2) is N2 = N(n)v = fL2([\u0016;1))\u2297 \u20182(n) : \u22121 6 \u0016 6 +1g, and clearly\nB is the intersection of the two nests algebras Alg(N1) and Alg(N2).\nIf (ii) holds, then, by the uniqueness of the Weyl relations [9], there exists n =\n1; 1; 2; : : : and a unitary W : H! L2(R)(n) = L2(R)\u2297 \u20182(n) mapping U (1)\u0015 to D\u0003\u0015 \u2297 I\nand U (2)\u0016 to M\u0016 \u2297 I. It is now clear that W will then map B = Alg(N1 xN2) to\nA\u2297B(\u20182(n)).\nIf (iv) holds, then after a unitary equivalence we may write U (1)\u0015 = D\n\u0003\n\u0015 \u2297 I and\nU (2)\u0016 = M\u0016 \u2297 I. Observing that the commutant of fD\u0003\u0015 \u2297 I;M\u0016 \u2297 I: \u0015 2 R; \u0016 2 Rg is\nCI \u2297B(\u20182(n)), we conclude that B is the weak star closed linear span of all products\nof the form (D\u0015M\u0016)\u2297T where \u0015 > 0; \u0016 > 0 and T 2 B(\u20182(n)). Thus B = A\u2297B(\u20182(n))\nby Theorem 2\u00011. The converse is easy.\nThe equivalence of (v) and (ii) follows from [1] and our earlier remarks.\n3. The invariant subspace lattice of A\nLet fM\u0015 : \u0015 > 0g and fD\u0016 : \u0016 > 0g be the multiplication and translation semi-\ngroups, as before. Let s > 0 and let K be a proper subspace of the nest Ns. Then\nK = M\u001esM\u0015H\n2(R)\nfor some real constant \u0015 (recall that \u001es(x) = e\u2212isx\n2=2). Clearly K is simply invariant\nfor the multiplication semigroup. Furthermore, for \u0016 > 0,D\u0016M\u001es = \u001es(\u0016)M\u001esM\u0016sD\u0016\n532 A. Katavolos and S. C. Power\nand so\nD\u0016K = M\u001esM\u0016sD\u0016M\u0015H\n2(R)\n= M\u001esM\u0016sM\u0015H\n2(R)\n\u0012 K\nsince \u0016s > 0, and it follows that K is also simply invariant for the translation\nsemigroup.\nThe converse is also true.\nTheorem 3\u00011. Every closed subspace K of L2(R) which is simply invariant for both\nthe multiplication and translation semigroups is necessarily of the above form for some\ns > 0 and for some real constant \u0015.\nProof. The following natural cocycle argument is due to Donald Sarason.\nAs K is simply invariant for the multiplication semigroup there is a unimodular\nfunction u such that K = uH2(R). It will be shown that u(x) = ce\u2212i(\u001a 12x2+\u001bx) for some\n\u001a > 0 and \u001b 2 R, where c is a unimodular constant.\nSince each subspace DtK, for t > 0, is also of this form, with DtK \u0012 K, it follows\nthat DtK = wtuH2(R) for some inner function wt. Thus wt divides ws, if 0 < t < s.\nMoreover, DtK = u(x \u2212 t)H2(R) and so we have u(x \u2212 t) = ctwt(x)u(x) for some\nunimodular constant ct which, by rede\fning wt, we may take to be 1. Consider now\nthe resulting cocycle identity\nws+t(x) =\nu(x\u2212 s\u2212 t)\nu(x)\n=\nu(x\u2212 s\u2212 t)\nu(x\u2212 s)\nu(x\u2212 s)\nu(x)\n= wt(x\u2212 s)ws(x):\nThis implies that for 0 < t < s the inner function wt(x\u2212 r) divides ws for 0 < r <\ns \u2212 t. Fix s and t with 0 < t < s. If wt has any zeros in the upper half-plane, then\nthose zeros and all their translates by r with 0 < r < s\u2212 t must be zeros of ws, which\nis impossible, since ws is analytic in the upper half-plane. Thus wt is a singular inner\nfunction and we can write, for some unimodular \u000b, some real \f and some singular\nmeasure \u0016,\nwt(z) = \u000bei\fz exp\n\u0012\ni\nZ\nR\nsz + 1\ns\u2212 z\n1\ns2 + 1\nd\u0016(s)\n\u0013\n(Imz > 0):\nLet \u000b0; \f0 and \u0017 be the triple associated with ws. Since wt(x\u2212 r) divides ws for all\nr in an interval it follows that the associated r-translates of \u0016 are dominated by \u0017\nand hence that \u0016 = 0.\nTo see this note \frst that (ws(z))=(wt(z \u2212 r)) = e\u2212ur where ur is analytic in the\nupper half plane and Re ur > 0: Also, calculation shows that\nRe ur(x + iy) = (\f0 \u2212 \f)y +\nZ\nR\ny\n(s\u2212 x)2 + y2 (d\u0017(s)\u2212 d\u0016(s\u2212 r)):\nSince ur is harmonic, we obtain \f0 \u2212 \f > 0 and the desired domination condition.\n(See, for example, theorem I\u00013\u00015c of [5].)\nWe now have \u0016(A\u2212 r) 6 \u0017(A) for all Borel subsets A of R and so the measure \u00160\non R de\fned by\n\u00160(A) =\nZ s\u2212t\n0\n\u0016(A\u2212 r)dr\nThe Fourier binest algebra 533\nsatis\fes \u00160(A) 6 (s\u2212 t)\u0017(A). Since \u0017 is singular and \u00160 is absolutely continuous with\nrespect to Lebesgue measure it follows that \u00160 is zero and hence so is \u0016.\nIt follows that\nwt(x) = \u000b(t)ei\f(t)x:\nwhere \u000b(t) is unimodular, \f(t) is nonnegative. Also, from the de\fnition of wt, \f is\nstrictly increasing.\nNote that \u000b(t) is measurable. This follows from the equation u(x \u2212 t)=u(x) =\n\u000b(t)ei\f(t)x. The quotient u(x \u2212 t)=u(x) is measurable in (x; t) and is continuous in\nx for each \fxed t. Thus for each x the quotient, and hence \u000b, is measurable in t.\nBy the cocycle identity we have\n\u000b(s + t)ei\f(s+t)x = \u000b(t)ei\f(t)(x\u2212s)\u000b(s)ei\f(s)x\nand so\n\u000b(s + t) = \u000b(s)\u000b(t)e\u2212i\f(t)s\nand\n\f(s + t) = \f(s) + \f(t):\nSince \f is increasing it follows that \f is continuous and hence that \f(t) = \u001at for\nsome positive constant \u001a.\nNow de\fne\n\u03b3(t) = \u000b(t)ei\u001a\n1\n2 t\n2\nThen \u03b3 is measurable and\n\u03b3(s + t) = \u03b3(s)\u03b3(t);\nwhich implies that \u03b3(t) = ei\u001bt for some real constant \u001b. Hence\n\u000b(t) = ei(\u2212\u001a\n1\n2 t\n2+\u001bt)\nand so\nwt(x) = ei(\u2212\u001a\n1\n2 t\n2+\u001bt+\u001atx) =\nu(x\u2212 t)\nu(x)\n:\nThis equation holds for some x = x0 and almost all t > 0 and so\nu(x0 \u2212 t) = u(x0)ei(\u2212\u001a 12 t2+\u001bt+\u001atx0):\nEquivalently\nu(y) = cei(\u2212\u001a\n1\n2y\n2\u2212\u001by)\nholds for almost every y < x0, for some unimodular constant c depending on x0. But\nin fact the last assertion holds for almost every x0 from which we conclude that c is\nindependent of x0 and that the equality holds almost everywhere.\nTheorem 3\u00012. The invariant projection lattice of the Fourier binest algebra is pre-\ncisely the multinest consisting of the union of the binest NvDNa with xs>0Ns and\nthis multinest is reflexive. Moreover, the supremum and in\fmum of proper elements of\ndistinct nests are L2(R) and the zero subspace respectively.\n534 A. Katavolos and S. C. Power\nProof. If a nonzero closed subspace of L2(R) is invariant for fM\u0015: \u0015 > 0g and\nfD\u0016 : \u0016 > 0g but is not simply invariant for one of these semigroups then it is\nnecessarily equal to L2(R). In view of what we have proven above it follows that the\nmultinest, M say, coincides with the bi-invariant projections, that is,\nM = LatfM\u0015; D\u0016: \u0015; \u0016 > 0g\nThis equality shows that M is a reflexive lattice. By the density of the bianalytic\nWeyl algebra given in Theorem 2\u00011(i), the bi-invariant lattice must coincide with\nLat A, and so M = Lat A.\nThe last assertion can be seen quickly from the following short argument, or from\nthe more elementary argument of Lemma 4\u00013.\nBy the previous paragraph, the supremum and in\fmum of two elements of M\nmust each belong to one of the subnests of M. It suf\fces therefore to prove that if\nN and L are proper elements of M with N \u0012 L, then they must both belong to the\nsame subnest. If one of them belongs to Nv, then the assertion follows easily from\nthe F. and M. Riesz theorem. Otherwise, by Lemma 3\u00011, N = \u001es1K1 and L = \u001es2K2\nwhere s1 and s2 are positive and K1 = M\u00151H\n2(R);K2 = M\u00152H2(R) are in Na. Since\nN \u0012 L, it follows that the function\ne\u2212i(s1\u2212s2)\n1\n2x\n2\nei(\u00151\u2212\u00152)x\nis inner, and this implies that s1 = s2. (Recall (see, for example, [5]) that a continuous\ninner function on the line has the form cei\u0016x for some non-negative \u0016 and unimodular\nconstant c.)\nReplacing the parametrization (s; \u0015), for s > 0; \u0015 2 R, with a parametrization\nindexed by (\u22121; 1) \u0002 (\u2212 12\u0019; 12\u0019), we can identify Lat A, as a set, with the closed\nunit disc D\u2212 in R2. The left and right boundary semicircles correspond to Na and\nNv respectively. The other nests correspond to lines of longitude from the maximal\nelement (0, 1) to the minimal element (0; \u22121), and the partial ordering on D\u2212 is the\ncorresponding disjoint ordering.\nAt the moment Na and Nv have no distinguished identity in this realisation,\nsince permutation of the parameter space [\u22121; 1] induces a order isomorphism of\nD\u2212. However, we see in the next section that LatA, with the topology induced by\nthe strong operator topology, is homeomorphic to D\u2212.\n4. Unitary automorphisms and the topology of Lat (A)\nConsider the one parameter unitary group fVt : t 2 Rg given by (Vtf )(x) =\net=2f (etx) for f in L2(R).

The matrix group can\nbe viewed as the semidirect product R2 \u0002\u0014 R for the action \u0014 of the additive group\nR on the additive group R2 given by\n\u0014t(\u0015; \u0016) = (et\u0015; e\u2212t\u0016):\nObserve that for all t in R we have VtNv = Nv; VtNa = Na, and also VtNs1 =\nNs2 where s2 = e\n2ts1. In particular it follows that for each element g in R2 \u0002\u0014 R\nthe automorphism \u001a(g) restricts to a unitary automorphism of the Fourier binest\nalgebra. We shall show below that the converse also holds. For this we need the fact\nthat Lat(A) is homeomorphic to the unit disc in order to identify the nests Nv\nand Na. From this it follows that a unitary automorphism either leaves these nests\ninvariant or exchanges them. In fact the latter possibility cannot occur.\nLemma 4\u00011. LetU be a unitary operator onL2(R) such that Ad(U ) is an automorphism\nof Aa and of Av. Then Ad(U ) = \u001a(g) for some g in R2 \u0002\u0014 R.\nProof. Since Ad(U ) gives an automorphism of Av, the unitary U must factor as\nU = M\u001eV , where \u001e is a unimodular function in L1(R) and V induces an order\nisomorphism of Nv. (See [4], chapter 17.) Thus V is a composition operator Cg\ngiven by (Cgf )(t) = (g0(t))\n1\n2 f (g(t)) where g: R ! R is a continuous order preserving\nbijection.\nConsider now the order isomorphism \u0012 of the multinest given by \u0012(M ) = UM .\nSince \u0012 leaves invariant Na and Nv; we have \u0012N1 = Nq for some positive number\nq. Replacing U by UVt, for suitable t, we may assume, without loss of generality,\nthat \u0012N1 = N1. In particular this means that for some real number \u0015\nM\u001eCgM\u001e1H\n2(R)) = M\u001e1M\u0015H2(R)\nand hence\nM\u001eM\u001e1\u000egCgH\n2(R) = M\u001e1M\u0015H2(R):\nOn the other hand \u0012(Na) = Na and so, for some real number \u0016; M\u001eCgH2(R) =\nM\u0016H\n2(R). It follows that the function e\u2212i(g(x)2\u2212x2)=2ei(\u0016\u2212\u0015)x must be constant, and\nhence that g(x) = x\u2212 \u0015 + \u0016 for all x. Therefore Cg = D\u0015\u2212\u0016, and hence \u001e = cei\u0016x for\nsome unimodular constant c. Thus U = M\u0016D\u0015\u2212\u0016, as required.\nLemma 4\u00012.

But L is also invariant under the multiplication semigroup. Thus, by\nLemma 3\u00011, L = M\u001esM\u0015H2(R) and \u001e has the asserted form.\nOn the other hand, by the previous lemma we have thatM\u0003\u001esFM sH\n2(R) = H2(R),\nsince s > 0, i.e. FM sH\n2(R) = M\u001esH2(R), so that\nM\u0015FM sH\n2(R) = M\u0015M\u001esH2(R)\n= FM H2(R):\nIt follows that\nFD\u2212\u0015M sH\n2(R) = FM H2(R)\nso that  (x) = b s(x + \u0015), as required.\nThe next simple lemma is useful for understanding the topology on the multinest\nwhich is induced by the strong operator topology.

Parametrise the set D\u2212nf\u0006ig as\nft cos \u001e + i sin\u001e: t 2 [\u22121; 1]; \u001e 2 (\u2212 12\u0019; 12\u0019)g:\nSetting s = (1 + t)=(1 \u2212 t) 2 [0;1] and \u0015 = tan\u001e 2 (\u22121;+1), write Ps;\u0015 for the\nprojection onto the subspace\nKs;\u0015 = D\u0015M\u001esH\n2(R) = M\u0015sM\u001esH2(R); when s 2 [1;1);\nwrite Ps;\u0015 for the projection onto the subspace\nKs;\u0015 = M\u0015M\u001esH\n2(R); when s 2 [0; 1];\nand write P1;\u0015 for the projection onto\nK1;\u0015 = L2([\u0015;1)):\nMapping i to the identity and \u2212i to the zero operator, we obtain a bijection of\nthe closed unit disc onto the multinest. It is clear that this bijection maps the left\nsemicircle f\u2212 cos \u001e + i sin\u001e : \u001e 2 [\u2212 12\u0019; 12\u0019]g onto the analytic nest Na = fK0 ; \u0015 :\n\u22121 6 \u0015 6 +1g and the right semicircle fcos\u001e + i sin\u001e: \u001e 2 [\u2212 12\u0019; 12\u0019]g onto the\nVolterra nest Nv = fK1 ; \u0015 : \u22121 6 \u0015 6 +1g. Since D\u2212 is compact, it remains to\nprove that this mapping is continuous.\nFirst, it is immediate that as s ! s0 2 [1;1) and \u0015 ! \u00150 2 R, the projections\nPs;\u0015 = D\u0015M\u001esP0;0M\n\u0003\n\u001es\nD\u0003\u0015 converge strongly to Ps0;\u00150 . The mapping is therefore con-\ntinuous at (s0; \u00150) for 1 6 s0 < 1: Similarly there is continuity if s0 2 [0; 1] and so\nthe mapping is continuous on the union of D and the left semicircle.\nNext, observe that for each real \u0015, the projections Ps;\u0015 converge strongly to P1;\u0015\nas s! +1. Indeed, for s > 1,\nFKs;\u0015 = FD\u0015M\u001esH\n2(R)\n= M\u2212\u0015FM\u001esH\n2(R))\n= M\u2212\u0015M s(H\n2(R))?\nby Lemma 4\u00012. Therefore as s ! 1 the projections FPs;\u0015F \u0003 converge strongly to\nthe projection onto M\u2212\u0015(H2(R))?. From this it follows that Ps;\u0015 converges to the\nprojection P1;\u0015 onto L2[\u0015;1).\nAs a consequence one easily sees, using the fact that Ps;\u00151 6 Ps;\u0015 6 Ps;\u00152 when\n\u00151 6 \u0015 6 \u00152, that the projections Ps;\u0015 converge weakly, hence strongly to P1;\u00150\nas s ! +1 and \u0015 ! \u00150 2 R. Indeed, given g 2 L2(R) and \u000f > 0 \frst choose\n\u00151 < \u00150 < \u00152 such that j< (P1;\u0015 \u2212 P1;\u00150 )g; g >j < \u000f whenever \u0015 2 (\u00151; \u00152). Then\nchoose s0 > 0 such that j< (Ps;\u0015i \u2212 P1;\u0015i)g; g >j < \u000f for i = 1; 2 when s > s0. It\nfollows that j< (Ps;\u0015 \u2212 P1;\u00150 )g; g>j< 2\u000f whenever \u0015 2 (\u00151; \u00152) and s > s0.\nThis proves that the map\nt cos\u001e + i cos sin\u001e ! Ps(t);\u0015(\u001e)\nis continuous on D\u2212nf\u0006ig. To prove that it is continuous at \u2212i is equivalent to\nproving that as \u001e ! \u2212 12\u0019 the projections Ps(t);\u0015(\u001e) converge to 0 uniformly in t 2\n538 A. Katavolos and S. C. Power\n[\u22121; 1]. Fix g 2 L2(R). By what has been proved so far, for each \u001e 2 (\u2212 12\u0019; 12\u0019), the\nfunction t ! f\u001e(t) =< Ps(t);\u0015(\u001e)g; g > is continuous on the compact set [\u22121; 1]. Also\nfor each \fxed t 2 [\u22121; 1], f\u001e(t) decreases monotonically to 0 as \u001e ! \u2212 12\u0019. Hence\nlim\u001e!\u2212 12\u0019 f\u001e(t) = 0 uniformly in t by Dini\u2019s theorem. The proof of continuity at i is\nsimilar.\nTheorem 4\u00016. Let \u0019 be a unitary automorphism of the Fourier binest algebra. Then\n\u0019 = \u001a(g) for a unique g 2 G.\nProof. If \u001a(g)(A) = A for all A 2A, then \u001a(g)(M\u0015) = M\u0015 and \u001a(g)(D\u0015) = D\u0015 for all\n\u0015 2 R. It easily follows from the commutation relations that g must be the identity\nof the group G. This settles uniqueness.\nNow let \u0019 = Ad(U ) determine an automorphism of A. Then the map \u0012U : K !\nU (K) is a continuous order automorphism of the partially ordered compact Haus-\ndorff space Lat A. Since Lat A is homeomorphic to the unit disc, \u0012U must map\nthe boundary Nv x Na onto itself. Since \u0012U also preserves order and maps the\nminimal and maximal elements to themselves, it follows that either \u0012U (Na) = Nv\nor \u0012U (Na) = Na. In the latter case, of necessity, \u0012U (Nv) = Nv and Lemma 4\u00011\ncompletes the proof.\nIt will be enough then to show that there is no unitary operator U with \u0012UNa =\nNv and \u0012UNv = Na.\nAssume then that U is a unitary operator which exchanges the Volterra nest and\nthe analytic nest. Then Nv = \u0012UNa = \u0012UFNv and, moreover, \u0012UF is an order pre-\nserving bijection of Nv onto itself. Consequently UF = M\u001eCg for some unitary mul-\ntiplication operator M\u001e and composition operator Cg determined by an increasing\nbijection g: R! R. But now, since \u0012F\u0003Nv = N?a our assumption that \u0012UNv = Na\nleads to\nNa = \u0012UNv = \u0012UFN?a :\nThus, for some real numbers \u00151; \u00152, with \u00152 < \u00151,\nH2(R) = M\u001eCgM\u00151H2(R)?\nand\nM1H\n2(R) = M\u001eCgM\u00152H2(R)?:\nHence, with \u0016 = \u00152 \u2212 \u00151, we have\nM1H\n2(R) = M\u001eCg(M\u0016M\u00151H2(R)?) = Mei\u0016g (M\u001eCgM\u00151H2(R)?) = Mei\u0016gH2(R):\nThus g(x) = \u0016\u22121x + c for some real constant c. However, since \u0016\u22121 is negative this\ncontradicts the fact that g is increasing.\nAcknowledgements. A.
