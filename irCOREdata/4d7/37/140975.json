Introduction\nIntegral structures can be designed and fabricated to be lighter and cheaper than the conventional me-\nchanically fastened assemblies, but they generally lack redundant structural members. Consequently, cracks\nwill propagate much faster once initiated and without the means of crack retarders or stoppers. In order to\nsatisfy the regulator\u2019s requirements and make the integral structures fail safe, crack retarders must be used\n[1\u20135]. Physical testing of all designs and strap choices is virtually impossible; hence a reliable analysis tool\nis needed.\nIn the first part of this two-part paper, a comprehensive 2D FE model is presented for calculating crack tip\nstress intensity factors (SIF) and then predicting fatigue crack growth (FCG) life of structures reinforced\nby bonded straps [6]. Some modelling techniques are available in the literature to study this problem [7\u201315],\nbut a model including all the known effects which influence the life has never been attempted before. Lena\net al. [11] have developed a methodology which deals with most of the effects. They studied double sided\nreinforced plates by using the modelling technique developed by Sun et al. [7\u201310]. Due to the symmetric\nconfiguration no secondary bending was generated, then no effect of bending on the SIF needed to be con-\nsidered and, moreover, the crack profile through the thickness is symmetric which simplifies the analysis.\nDouble sided reinforcements are not only simpler to model, but they are also more effective in retarding\ncrack propagation. However, they cannot be used to comply with other design needs such as maintaining\nthe external shape of fuselage and wings for aerodynamic reasons. Lena et al. [11] included also the effect of\nthermal residual stresses (TRS) in their analysis. The curing temperature of the adhesive was not assumed\nas described in [6] but was assessed by running different models at different trial temperatures to compute\nthe FCG lives and, by comparing the predicted FCG lives with the experimental one, the curing temperature\nof the adhesive was found. Clearly, using this procedure, any possible error encountered in computing the\nSIF and the scatter showed by the test will be absorbed in the curing temperature which was found to be\nof just 42 \u25e6C when it should have been of 100 \u25e6C as showed in [6] and confirmed by experiments in section\n3.3. Moreover, due to the lack of experimental data, the effect of the TRS was considered to increase the\nmaximum SIF instead of changing the R-ratio as it was explained in [6].\nIn contrast with previous methodologies, the modelling technique presented in part I [6] was developed to\ntake account of all main mechanisms involved in bonded strap reinforced structures, such as the beneficial\nactions of stiffening and crack bridging, the adverse effects of thermal residual stresses and adhesive disbond,\n0HB\n2\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nas well as the secondary bending and non-uniform crack profile through the thickness. The aim of this sec-\nond part of the paper is to present the modelling results against experimental tests found in the literature\n[3\u20135] for validation purpose. Firstly, the method to compute the non-uniform distribution of SIF through\nthe thickness by using 2D FE analysis is validated against 3D FE results (section 3.1). Secondly, calculated\ndisbond shape and area are compared with experimental measurements found in [3] (section 3.2). Thirdly,\nTRS are calculated by running a thermal load analysis to simulate the consequence of adhesive curing pro-\ncess and for keeping the residual stress field in the analysis models before applying external stresses in order\nto simulate the redistribution behaviour of these stresses during substrate crack propagation. Calculated\nvalues are compared with experimental measurements in [16,17] in section 3.3 for different strap materials\nand geometries. The coupling effect between the thermal and mechanical loads is analysed in section 3.4,\nwhich also shows the errors caused by the usually used superposition method. Finally predicted FCG lives\nof three different reinforced plates are compared with experimental results in [3,4] to validate the modelling\nmethodology (section 3.5).\n2. Experimental validation data\nTo validate the modelling technique described in [6], test results reported in an experimental investigation\nconducted by Irving and Figueroa-Gordon et al [3\u20135] have been used. In this work single edge notch tension\n(SENT) and middle crack tension M(T) samples of 7085\u2212T7651 aluminium alloy , 10 mm thick, were\nsubjected to fatigue loading. The material fatigue crack growth rates for 7085\u2212T7651 is shown in figure 1\nwhere the curves for R ratio of 0.1 and 0.6 were obtained by fitting the test data in [18], and curves for other\nR ratios are obtained by using the Harter T-method [19]. Test samples with bonded straps are shown in\nfigure 2. Straps in [3\u20135] were made of four different materials, which were the glass fibre reinforced polymer\n(GFRP), carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP), titanium alloy Ti-6AL-4V (Ti-6-4), and the fibre-metal\nlaminate called GLARE I 3\/2 (GLARE). These straps were bonded to the substrate using FM 94 adhesive\ncured at 120\u25e6C. Mechanical properties of the strap and substrate materials, used as input to the predictive\nmodel described in [6], are given in table 1. Strap dimensions were variable. A notation is used in this work\nto specify the strap dimensions, which is wXXdY Y tZZlSSS, where w is the strap width, d the distance\nbetween strap edge and initial crack tip, t the strap thickness, and l the strap total length. For example,\nw20d2.5t4.4l180 defines a strap of 20 mm wide, 2.5 mm from the initial crack tip, 4.4 mm thick, and 180\nmm long.\n3\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1\u22c510-8\n 1\u22c510-7\n 1\u22c510-6\n 1\u22c510-5\n1 10 100\nda\n\/d\nN\n, m\n\/c\nyc\nle\n\u2206 K, MPa \u22c5 m0.5\nR=0.1 (best-fit)\nR=0.2 (Harter T-method)\nR=0.3 (Harter T-method)\nR=0.4 (Harter T-method)\nR=0.5 (Harter T-method)\nR=0.6 (best-fit)\nFig. 1.

Stress intensity factor through-thickness distribution\nThe first step of methodology validation was to compare the through-thickness distribution of the strain\nenergy release rate (SERR) and stress intensity factor (SIF) obtained by the 2D model with those by a 3D\nFE model.\nThe SENT sample (figure 2(b)) was used for this purpose with an initial crack length of 32 mm reinforced\nby a titanium strap of dimension w20d5t2l200. The analysis was conducted at \u03c3max = 18.57 MPa.

Kroon, GTM-advanced structures.\nconsidered in this analysis in order to focus on validating the method of using 2D plate finite elements\nwith multi-point constraint (MPC) to take account of the secondary bending effect. SERR and SIF were\ncalculated for each crack length.\nFirstly, calculated SERR through-thickness distributions are shown in figure 3 for two crack lengths. The\nso-called top surface is where the strap is bonded (z = 10 mm). SERR obtained by the 2D model (noted\nas GI 2D) is in good agreement with that obtained by 3D model (GI 3D). A parabolic fitting curve is also\nplotted (GI 3D par) to show it fits perfectly with the result by the 3D model with exception at the top\nand bottom surfaces of the plate. This confirms that the SERR distribution has a parabolic shape. The\ndiscrepancy at the top and bottom faces may be explained by the crack tip stress singularity; when crack\nintersects with a free surface, the order of stress singularity differs from the inverse-square-root singularity\nof a 2D (through-thickness) crack problem described by the Westergaard stress function, thus, at the plate\nsurface a crack cannot be characterised by the SIF [21].\nThe corresponding SIF through-thickness distribution are shown in figure 4. Again 2D (KI 2D) and 3D\n(KI 3D) results are in good agreement. The 2D SIF looks like a straight line, but it is actually the square\nroot of a parabola, which is reduced closely to a line. A fitting line (KI 3D lin) is plotted to extrapolate the\n5\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n3D SIF values to the top and bottom faces of the plate; it does not fit the results as well as the parabolic\nfit does for the SERR. This is because that SIF is not strictly a straight line.\nIn figure 5 the SERR and SIF at the top (reinforced side) and bottom faces are plotted against crack length\n(a) and compared with the mean SERR and its corresponding SIF (root mean square value) obtained by\nthe 2D and 3D analyses. Good agreement is archived between 2D and 3D models for each crack length.\nTherefore the 2D model is validated in terms of the SERR and SIF through-thickness distributions by\ntaking into account of the secondary bending effect.\n 0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  1.2  1.4\nz,\n m\nm\nGI, kJ\/m\n2\nGI 2D\nGI 3D\nGI 3D par\n(a) Crack length a = 52 mm\n 0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 0  0.5  1  1.5  2  2.5  3\nz,\n m\nm\nGI, kJ\/m\n2\nGI 2D\nGI 3D\nGI 3D par\n(b) Crack length a = 92 mm\nFig. 3.

SENT sample with titanium strap w20d20t2l200.\n3.2. Progressive disbond failure\nAnother important mechanism in bonded crack retarder problem is the progressive disbond of adhesive\nthat reduces the effectiveness of the strap. This progressive disbond should be adequately modelled in order\nto achieve good prediction of FCG life. Both the SENT and M(T) specimens were used in this analysis .\nThe SENT had an initial crack length (ao) of 32 mm and was reinforced by a titanium strap of w20d5t2l200.\nApplied cyclic stress was \u03c3max = 18.57 MPa, R = 0.1. The M(T) had an initial crack length (2ao) of 22 mm\nand was reinforced by a GFRP strap of dimensions w20d2.5t4.4l180. Applied cyclic stress was \u03c3max = 60\nMPa, R = 0.1.\nPredicted final disbond shape and area are compared with the experimental measurements in [3,4]. Before\ndiscussing the comparisons, the meaning of final disbond damage needs some clarification. In the experi-\nmental test, disbond grew progressively and two failure modes were observed when substrate crack reached\nits critical length, i.e. either one side of the strap (divided by the crack growth path) debonded completely\nfrom the substrate and the experiment stopped, or the two \u201cparts\u201d of the substrate (separated by the crack)\nwere kept connected, or bridged, by the strap and the test machine kept running even the substrate had\nbroken into two pieces. In the second case, although the structure could still stand the load, the test was\nconsidered finished since the substrate had failed. During the experiment it was often difficult to decide if\nthe strap had debonded completely and, subsequently, the sample failed, or the substrate had failed before\nthe strap debonded completely on one side of the crack because the adhesive was unable to transfer all the\nload to the strap. Conventionally the final disbond area is defined as the adhesive failure area obtained at\n7\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nthe end of the test, i.e. when the reinforced plate fails due to either of the two modes. If one side of the strap\nis completely debonded, then the area on the other side is taken as final disbond damage extent. From the\nmodelling point of view, final disbond area is obtained by one of the following definitions: 1) when strap\ndebonds from substrate completely; 2) the disbond area at the critical crack length in the substrate.\nFigure 6(a) shows the comparison of calculated and measured final disbond shape for the titanium strap\nreinforced SENT sample. In the figures only the lower half of the strap is shown and the disbond and bonded\nareas are indicated. Substrate crack growth path was from the upper left corner to the right as indicated.\nPredicted and measured final disbond shape and area are in good agreement.\nDisbonds in the M(T) plate reinforced by two GFRP straps are shown in figure 6(b). The agreement between\nthe predicted and measured [3,4] disbond areas are not as good as for the SENT sample with titanium strap.\nThe actual disbond damage has two disbond fronts: one was close to the substrate crack (upper part in the\nfigure) and the other started from the bottom corner of the strap (strap end edge). The modelling work did\nnot find this second disbond front because disbond initiation is primarily driven by the passing of substrate\ncrack. However, by analysing the FE calculated stresses in the adhesive it is found that, for an un-cracked\nsubstrate, the maximum shear stress is actually developed at the strap free ends (bottom corners in figure\n6(b)) as well as the maximum peal stress which is constant on the bottom free edge of the strap. The mixed\nmode caused by the peel and shear stress is likely to cause this second disbond front on the free edges of the\nstraps, starting from the corners and growing towards the middle of the strap under joint action of shear\nand peel.\n3.3. Thermal residual stresses and their redistribution with crack growth\nThermal residual stresses (TRS) are caused by curing adhesive at elevated temperature. They influence\nFCG rate and should be considered in predictive models. TRS can be experimentally measured, but testing\nis time and money consuming. For this reason a modelling technique has been developed.\nIn this paper residual stresses in the SENT sample reinforced by straps of different dimensions and materials\nare presented to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology presented in [6]. Adhesive FM94 was cured\nat 120 \u25e6C. There are two steps in the analysis: the first is to determine the initial residual stress distribution\nafter the curing process; the second is to model a series of stress re-distribution during crack propagation.\nCalculated residual stresses are plotted along the sample\u2019s width in three different thickness positions (figure\n7).\n8\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n(a) SENT sample and Ti strap\nw20d5t2l200.\n(b) M(T) sample with GFRP strap\nw20d2.5t4.4l180.\nFig. 6. Final disbond shapes: modelling (right) vs. experimental measurements (left) [3,4]. Only half of the strap is illustrated.\nDimensions in figure 2\nFig. 7. SENT specimen and different thickness position lines along which TRS were calculated and measured.\nPredictions obtained by the 2D FE modelling technique presented in the first part of the paper [6] are\ncompared with the experimental measurements obtained by Liljedahl et al. as part of the same project\nand reported in [16,17]. The measurements of residual stress profiles in the substrate were obtained by\nusing the neutron diffraction technique, which is a well-established non-destructive method that can mea-\nsure through-thickness residual stress distributions. Experimentally measured TRS are reported in [16] for\nsamples reinforced by titanium straps and in [17] for all other strap materials. Calculated initial TRS dis-\ntribution is plotted against experiments in figure 8 for different strap materials, widths and thicknesses. For\neach strap configuration, the calculated and measured are in reasonably good agreement. Discussions for\neach strap configuration are given below.\nFigures 8(a) and 8(b) show the initial stress distribution for the titanium strap cases. Two different strap\nthickness (w20d20t2l200 and w20d20t4l200) were used. Although the cure temperature, the elastic modulus\n9\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nand coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) are all the same for the two cases, TRS produced by the thicker\n(4 mm) strap are higher. This is because that thicker strap is stiffer, consequently when the temperature\ndrops to the room temperature the strap does not contract with the substrate as much as the thinner strap\nwill do and the displacements compatibility between strap and substrate is achieved at a higher stress level\nin the substrate. It is also worth noting the stress concentration spot beneath the strap, i.e. the \u201cbump\u201d\nfeature in the graphs related to the Ti strap; the reason will be discussed in the next paragraphs.\nStrap width effect can be seen by comparing figure 8(a) with 8(d) (w20d20t2l200 vs. w100d20t2l200) and\n8(b) with 8(c) (w20d20t4l200 vs. w60d20t4l200) where TRS caused by titanium straps of different widths\nare plotted. Peak stress values for the wider straps are higher due to the higher stiffness. Therefore, the\nstiffer the strap, the higher the TRS peak values.\nStresses caused by straps of the same dimensions (w20d20t2l200) but different materials are plotted in figures\n8(a), 8(e), and 8(f), respectively for the titanium, GFRP, and CFRP straps. TRS are strongly influenced by\nmaterial\u2019s CTE and elastic modulus. Observation from these results is: the stiffer the strap and the lower the\nlongitudinal CTE, the higher the TRS. The CFRP strap produces the highest TRS (figure 8(f)), followed by\nthe titanium strap (figure 8(a)) and then the GFRP (figure 8(e)); GFRP has the lowest longitudinal elastic\nmodulus.\nNeither the CFRP nor the GFRP straps produced the distinct \u201cbump\u201d feature beneath the strap as the\ntitanium strap does 8(a). The \u201cbump\u201d is caused by the titanium alloy\u2019s isotropic property; hence the strap\ndoes not contract in the transverse direction (x-direction) at the same rate as the aluminium substrate\nduring the temperature drop, since the CTE of the titanium (8.6 \u00b5\u25e6C\u22121) is much lower than that of the\naluminium (23.6 \u00b5\u25e6C\u22121). This causes tensile residual stress also in the x-direction that due to the Poisson\u2019s\neffect will make the substrate contract in the y-direction adding extra residual stress to what caused by the\ny-direction contraction. However, since the substrate and strap have to satisfy the displacement compatibil-\nity requirement, there is an increase in \u03c3yy beneath the strap. No \u201cbump\u201d for GFRP and CFRP reinforced\ncases because the CTE in the transverse direction (\u03b122) of this two polymer composites (respectively 30 and\n21 \u00b5\u25e6C\u22121) is very close to that of the aluminium substrate (23.6 \u00b5\u25e6C\u22121); consequently, in the transverse or\nthe x-direction, these straps contract at the same rate of the aluminium substrate during the temperature\ndrop causing no further increase in the y-direction stresses.\nWhen the crack propagates, TRS will re-distribute, that will in turn influence the crack growth rate. The\nSENT sample reinforced by titanium strap (w20d20t2l200) is used to demonstrate the analysis for four\ndifferent crack lengths. Figure 9 shows the predicted TRS at two thickness positions (see figure 7) and\n10\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n-20\n 0\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140\n\u03c3\nyy\n,\n \nM\nPa\nx, mm\nStrap\nTest z=7.5mm\nFEA z=7.5mm\nTest z=5mm\nFEA z=5mm\nTest z=2.5mm\nFEA z=2.5mm\n(a) Titanium strap w20d20t2l200\n-20\n 0\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140\n\u03c3\nyy\n,\n \nM\nPa\nx, mm\nStrap\nTest z=7.5mm\nFEA z=7.5mm\nTest z=5mm\nFEA z=5mm\nTest z=2.5mm\nFEA z=2.5mm\n(b) Titanium strap w20d20t4l200\n-20\n 0\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140\n\u03c3\nyy\n,\n \nM\nPa\nx, mm\nStrap\nTest z=7.5mm\nFEA z=7.5mm\nTest z=5mm\nFEA z=5mm\nTest z=2.5mm\nFEA z=2.5mm\n(c) Titanium strap w60d20t4l200\n-20\n 0\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140\n\u03c3\nyy\n,\n \nM\nPa\nx, mm\nStrap\nTest z=7.5mm\nFEA z=7.5mm\nTest z=5mm\nFEA z=5mm\nTest z=2.5mm\nFEA z=2.5mm\n(d) Titanium strap w100d20t2l200\n-20\n 0\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140\n\u03c3\nyy\n,\n \nM\nPa\nx, mm\nStrap\nTest z=7.5mm\nFEA z=7.5mm\nTest z=5mm\nFEA z=5mm\nTest z=2.5mm\nFEA z=2.5mm\n(e) GFRP strap w20d20t2l200\n-20\n 0\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140\n\u03c3\nyy\n,\n \nM\nPa\nx, mm\nStrap\nTest z=7.5mm\nFEA z=7.5mm\nTest z=5mm\nFEA z=5mm\nTest z=2.5mm\nFEA z=2.5mm\n(f) CFRP strap w20d20t2l200\nFig. 8.

Influence of geometric nonlinearity and thermo-mechanical coupling\nIt is mentioned in the first part of this paper [6] that a dimensionless stress intensity factor (\u03b2) that is\nonly a function of the geometry does not exist for this bonded structure due to the geometric nonlinearity.\nIt will be demonstrated in this section that change in the applied load magnitude or the presence of TRS\nwill change the value of \u03b2. There are two reasons for this. First, the magnitude of secondary bending is a\nfunction of the applied load; second, the extent of disbond damage also depends on the applied load and a\ndifferent disbond area means a different geometry factor \u03b2.\nIn this study, the root mean square (RMS) value of the through-thickness SIF range, \u2206K, is determined by\nthe alternate analysis method [6] and is used for predicting FCG life. The \u03b2 factor is defined by:\n\u03b2 =\n\u2206K\n\u2206\u03c3\n\u221a\npia\n(1)\nwhere, \u2206\u03c3 is the applied stress range and a the crack length.\nIn figure 10(a) \u03b2 factor versus crack length is plotted for two SENT plates reinforced by titanium strap of\ndimension w20d20t2l200. One sample was cured at the room temperature and the other at 120 \u25e6C. Therefore,\njust the effect of the TRS can be seen in the \u03b2 solution. Initial crack length was ao = 17 mm and applied\nstress was \u03c3max = 18.57 MPa and R = 0.1, referred to as the \u201clow load\u201d case in this work. The curves can\nbe split into two parts according to the crack length. When a \u2264 50 mm, \u03b2 value is lower for the sample\ncured at elevated temperature (low load + TRS), because the TRS try to bend the plate in the opposite\ndirection to that of the secondary bending due to the applied load; this reduces the overall bending and\nconsequently the \u03b2 factor. When a \u2265 50 mm, the difference in \u03b2 solution is caused by the different disbond\narea. When there are TRS, adhesive is more stressed and the disbond damage is larger and \u03b2 is higher. It is\nknown in the literature that TRS do not influence the \u03b2 solution because the effect of TRS should be equal\nat the maximum and minimum applied stresses and consequently should not affect the SIF range, only the\neffective R ratio is changed [23,24]. This is true when there is no secondary bending involved, e.g. welded\njoints or cold worked samples. However, in this case, TRS affect the bending direction and magnitude, and\nconsequently they will influence the SIF range. Therefore, conventional \u03b2 solution by normalisation does\nnot exist.\nAnother comparison is shown in figure 10(b) where the SENT plate is subjected to the \u201chigh load\u201d (\u03c3max =\n60 MPa) and \u201clow load\u201d (\u03c3max = 18.57 MPa). Therefore the effect of the applied load on \u03b2 solution can\nbe seen. Again the curves can be split into two regions separated by crack length a = 40 mm. In the first\n13\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nregion only the effect of the load on the secondary bending can be seen because the adhesive has not yet\nstarted debonding. Higher load causes more bending, thus higher \u03b2 factor. In the second region (a > 40\nmm) adhesive is failing and higher load cause more adhesive disbond and consequently higher \u03b2 values.\nAnother important factor mentioned in [6] is that the mechanical and thermal loads must be applied at the\n 0.8\n 0.9\n 1\n 1.1\n 1.2\n 1.3\n 1.4\n 1.5\n 1.6\n 0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80\n\u03b2\na, mm\nStrap\nLow load + TRS\nLow load\n(a) Dependency of \u03b2 on thermal residual stress\n 0.8\n 0.9\n 1\n 1.1\n 1.2\n 1.3\n 1.4\n 1.5\n 1.6\n 0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80\n\u03b2\na, mm\nStrap\nHigh load + TRS\nLow load + TRS\n(b) Dependency of \u03b2 on applied load\nFig. 10.

This is due to the interaction\nbetween the mechanical and thermal loads; consequently, superposition of two separate analysis results\nmay lead to erroneous solution. In fact, each load causes bending in opposite directions; hence the overall\ndeformed shape affects the SIF and should be determined by considering both stress fields in one single\nanalysis. To demonstrate this effect the SENT sample with the titanium strap is modelled at the low stress\n(18.57 MPa). Calculated SIF values due to the mechanically applied stress (indicated by Kapp), thermal\nresidual stress (Kres), simple summation of the separate solutions (Kapp+Kres), and the total SIF obtained\nby a joint thermo-mechanical analysis (Ktot) are plotted against crack length (a) in figure 11(a). It can be\nseen that the coupling effect of the thermal and mechanical loads is not negligible. The errors (Err) caused\nby neglecting the coupling effect can be estimated as:\nErr =\nKtot \u2212 (Kapp +Kres)\n(Kapp +Kres)\n\u00d7 100 (2)\nErrors are also illustrated in figure 11(a) referring to the right axis. It is between \u221212% and +20%. The\nsame analysis was performed for the higher applied stress (60 MPa) and the results are shown in figure\n11(b). The error by superposition is slightly smaller (between \u22124% and +8%), but still not negligible. This\nis because that higher applied load means higher applied SIF, then the contribution of residual SIF to the\n14\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \ntotal SIF is relatively smaller, thus smaller error.\nThis analysis has demonstrated that due to the influence of secondary bending and adhesive disbond, the\n\u03b2 solution is also function of the applied load. Thus the SIF range must be computed case by case and a\ngeometry factor \u03b2 solution does not exist. Moreover, the coupling effect of thermal and mechanical loads\non secondary bending requires both load fields being taken into account in one FE analysis to compute the\nSIF; if the superposition method is applied, one might encounter an error of 20%.\n 0\n 10\n 20\n 30\n 40\n 50\n 0  20  40  60  80  100\n-12\n-8\n-4\n 0\n 4\n 8\n 12\n 16\n 20\nK\n, M\nPa\n m\n0.\n5\nEr\nro\nr, \n%\na, mm\nStrap\nKapp\nKres\nKapp+Kres\nKtot\nerror\n(a) Lower applied stress \u03c3app = 18.57 MPa\n 0\n 10\n 20\n 30\n 40\n 50\n 0  20  40  60  80  100\n-12\n-8\n-4\n 0\n 4\n 8\n 12\n 16\n 20\nK\n, M\nPa\n m\n0.\n5\nEr\nro\nr, \n%\na, mm\nStrap\nKapp\nKres\nKapp+Kres\nKtot\nerror\n(b) higher applied stress \u03c3app = 60 MPa\nFig. 11. Interaction of mechanical and thermal residual stresses at low and high applied loads. SENT sample with titanium\nstrap w20d20t2l200.\n3.5. FCG life prediction\nEach previously examined mechanism influences the crack growth driving force SIF, and hence the accu-\nracy in fatigue crack growth life prediction. Therefore, the ultimate validation test is to compare predicted\nFCG rate and life with test results. Following example samples were reinforced by straps made of the tita-\nnium, GLARE, and GFRP; mechanical properties used in the predictive models are given in table 1.\nThe first validation analysis was for the SENT plate reinforced by a titanium strap of dimension w20d5t2l200.\nThe initial crack length ao was 32 mm and the applied stress was \u03c3max = 18.57 MPa, R = 0.1. Predicted\nFCG rate and life are compared with the test results found in [3] in figures 12(a) and 12(b). Both root mean\nsquare (RMS) and weighted (w) value of the SIF range were used for the prediction. Good agreement is\nachieved by the weighted solution in terms of the FCG rate before the crack tip has passed the strap. After\nthat point calculated crack growth rate using the weighted SIF was slightly faster giving a conservative\nprediction of FCG life (error \u221217.1%). The RMS SIF produced a slightly lower crack growth rate at the\n15\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nbeginning and faster at the end giving a final value of number of cycle really close to the measured one\n(error +0.42%).\nThe second validation case used the M(T) plate reinforced by GLARE straps of dimension w10d8t5.4l180.\nThe initial half crack length ao was 20 mm and the applied stress was \u03c3max = 26.38 MPa, R = 0.1. The\nexperimental results are taken from [18]. Predicted FCG rate and life are showed in figures 12(c) and 12(d),\nrespectively. Again both weighted and RMS SIF values are used for the prediction. Using the weighted SIF\nsolution calculated FCG rate is in excellent agreement with the test results for crack lengths a > 30mm.\nHowever, since at the beginning the calculated FCG rate is slightly higher than the experimental mea-\nsured, the predicted life is conservative (error \u221213.5%). The RMS solution is in good agreement up to a\ncrack length of 30 mm but after that, it underestimates the FCG rate resulting error of +9.3% in the final life.\nThe last case is the M(T) plate reinforced by GFRP straps of dimension w20d2.5t4.4l180. The initial half\ncrack length ao was 11 mm and applied stress was \u03c3max = 60 MPa, R = 0.1. The experimental results can\nbe found in [4]. The results are shown in figures 12(e) and 12(f). The weighted solution is in good agreement\nwith the test until the crack approached the end of the strap and, after that, the crack growth rate is slightly\noverestimated causing an error of \u221215.5% in the final FCG life. The RMS solution produces a lower crack\ngrowth rate at the beginning and higher at the end resulting in a prediction error of 0.5%.\nA summary of the prediction and respective errors is given in table 2. Using the weighed SIF values\nproduces FCG lives that are consistently conservative. The lowest error values are obtained by the RMS SIF\nwith error range lower than 10%, but sometimes it overestimated the life. It seems that when a conservative\nsolution is needed the weighed SIF value should be used for life prediction. If an idea of the FCG life\nis wanted, using both weighed and RMS values could be a way to find the life range. From the results\npresented in figure 12 and table 2 the methodology to compute FCG life of bond strap reinforced plates can\nbe considered validated for different substrate geometries, load levels, and strap materials and geometries.\nMore validation cases can be found in [25].\n16\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 1\u22c510-8\n 1\u22c510-7\n 1\u22c510-6\n 1\u22c510-5\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140\nda\n\/d\nN\n, m\n\/c\nyc\nle\na, mm\nStrap\nTest (Ti6Al4V)\nFEM RMS (Ti6Al4V)\nFEM, w (Ti6Al4V)\n(a) FCG rate: SENT, Ti6Al4V strap w20d5t2l200\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n0 100000 200000 300000 400000 500000\na,\n m\nm\nNc\nStrap\nTest (Ti6Al4V)\nFEM RMS (Ti6Al4V)\nFEM w (Ti6Al4V)\n(b) FCG life: SENT, Ti6Al4V strap w20d5t2l200\n 1\u22c510-8\n 1\u22c510-7\n 1\u22c510-6\n 1\u22c510-5\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nda\n\/d\nN\n, m\n\/c\nyc\nle\na, mm\nStrap\nTest (GLARE)\nFEM, RMS (GLARE)\nFEM, w (GLARE)\n(c) FCG rate, M(T), GLARE strap w10d8t5.4l180\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n0 100000 200000 300000 400000 500000 600000 700000 800000\na,\n m\nm\nN, cycle\nStrap\nTest (GLARE)\nFEM, RMS (GLARE)\nFEM, w (GLARE)\n(d) FCG life, M(T), GLARE strap w10d8t5.4l180\n 1\u22c510-8\n 1\u22c510-7\n 1\u22c510-6\n 1\u22c510-5\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nda\n\/d\nN\n, m\n\/c\nyc\nle\na, mm\nStrap\nTest (GFRP)\nFEM, RMS (GFRP)\nFEM, w (GFRP)\n(e) FCG rate, M(T), GFRP strap w20d2.5t4.4l180\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000\na,\n m\nm\nN, cycle\nStrap\nTest (GFRP)\nFEM, RMS (GFRP)\nFEM, w (GFRP)\n(f) FCG life, M(T), GFRP strap w20d2.5t4.4l180\nFig. 12.

Conclusions\nThis paper has presented computational results and comparison with tests for validating the modelling\nmethodology described in the first part of the two-part paper; validation cases are presented for each iden-\ntified mechanism manifested in the bonded strap reinforced structures.\nThe SIF values calculated by the 2D FE model compares well with that obtained by a much more compu-\ntational intensive 3D model.\nProgressive adhesive failure is modelled by a quasi-static method using a mixed mode strain energy release\nrate criterion. Predicted final disbond shape and area agree with the experimental measurement.\nThermal residual stresses and their re-distribution with crack propagation are calculated for different strap\nmaterials and dimensions. Good agreement with the measured values is achieved for each strap configura-\ntion. Parameters influencing residual stresses are the elastic modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion\nof the adherends, strap size and the cure temperature.\nGeometrical nonlinearity due to the secondary bending and its dependency on applied load and disbond area\nmake it impossible to derive a non-dimensional SIF, i.e. the \u03b2 factor. Therefore, SIF needs to be computed\nfor each applied load level, and thermal and mechanical loads must be applied to the FE model simultane-\nously. For the cases presented in this paper, neglecting the thermal-mechanical coupling effect leads to an\nerror of up to 20 %.\nFinally, predicted fatigue crack growth rate and life are in reasonably good agreement with the tests.\nOne drawback of this modelling technique is the intensive computation caused by iterative calculations of\nthe SIF due to substrate crack and disbond propagation. Excessive computing time will be needed when\nthis methodology is applied to large-scale skin-stringer panels with multiple bonded straps. One possible\nsolution is to develop and implement in the FE code an empirical law of disbond growth under fatigue loads.\n18\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nAcknowledgements.
