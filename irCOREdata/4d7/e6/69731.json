Introduction \nMobile commerce refers to the use of mobile \nhandheld devices to conduct any electronic transaction \nor information interaction that leads to transfer of value \nin exchange for information, services or goods over \nwireless networks [1]. Examples of m-commerce \napplication include mobile financial services, mobile \ncontext services, on-line games, tickets and mobile \nshopping.  M-commerce enables consumers to play on-\nline games, trading stocks and get the latest sports \nresults using mobile phones.  It provides convenient, \nlocalization and personalized services to customers, \nemployees and businesses. Indeed, m-commerce \nrevolutionizes the way businesses interact with \nconsumers and with each other resulting in the creation \nof new business opportunities and the improvement of \nthe efficiency of business processes and quality of \nservices to consumers. \nIt is anticipated that the growth of m-commerce is \ndependent on the increasing confidence of wired \nInternet users to conduct transaction online. In 2004, \nthe global m-commerce market was worth $200 billion \nwith 130 million customers generating approximately \n14 billion transactions per year [2].  The convergence \nof mobile technology and the Internet has encouraged \nthe development of more sophisticated mobile phones \nwith greater capabilities, offering a range of services \nand functionalities. To date, worldwide mobile \nsubscribers are about 1.5 billion [3]. This figure is \nexpected to rise 33 percent by 2007 to two billion.  \nDue to the fact that mobile phones outnumber personal \ncomputers, m-commerce industry should take \nadvantage to offer better services to consumers. \nDespite generating billions in revenue especially in \ncountries with high levels of wireless adoption, there \nare still issues and challenges to be addressed. M-\ncommerce will become a commercial success only \nwhen the services offered are easy and convenient for \nconsumers to use. The complexity of the payment \ninfrastructure should be made invisible to avoid \nunnecessary confusion.  It is also vital to develop \nmobile payments based on existing methods and \nstandards in order to be easily accepted and adopted.   \nPerhaps, the most important factor to consider \nwhen conducting monetary transactions is security. \nMore value of a transaction, the higher security \nprotection should be. Security covers two main \nelements: channel security and content security [4]. \nChannel security is how secure the channel when \ntransaction is being conducted particularly when \npassing the sensitive information from one end to \nanother. On the other hand, content security is \nprimarily concerned with the information that has been \nreceived. According to Group Inc. it is predicted that in \n2005, 85 percent of wireless security incidents will be \nProceedings of the International Conference on Mobile Business (ICMB\u201905) \n0-7695-2367-6\/05 $20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

It describes the TrustZone architecture for \nARM devices and explains a typical mobile ticketing \nsystem.  Then, it introduces the mobile ticketing \nsystem using TrustZone technology developed for this \npaper.  Finally, it draws conclusions on the benefits of \nsuch system.    \n2. TrustZone technology \nOperating systems are by their very nature open \nand complex system and very difficult to secure. This \nmakes the devices used as part of the mobile commerce \ninfrastructure vulnerable to many forms of attack. \nTrustZone introduces security structure by providing a \nseparate secure domain to provide on-device security \nprotection to ensure data integrity. To systemize the \nimplementation of secure systems, it uses a hardware-\nenforced security domain to the core architecture and \nmemory system, in other words it isolates part of the \nchip architecture purely for secure information. It also \ndisassociates system security from complex non-secure \napplications as illustrated in Figure 1 [5]. This means \ndevices are capable of storing non-secure data and \nsensitive information separately within the secure \ndomain in the structure. This can be deployed in the \nmobile ticketing system. The later part of this paper \nwill explain how TrustZone technology can be \ndeployed in the mobile ticketing system which \nenhances the security measures in mobile commerce.  \n3. Mobile ticketing system  \n  Mobile ticketing is one of the m-commerce services \ncurrently being offered by wireless network operators. \nTo purchase a cinema ticket, for example, the user \nneeds to receive an electronic receipt as prove of \npurchase in order to get the cinema ticket. The \nproduction of such electronic receipt must satisfy a list \nof requirements: it needs to be recognized by the \ndelivery entity; it can be used as proof showing that the \nholder of the receipt has made the purchase and goods \ncan be delivered; it cannot be falsified and it cannot be \nduplicated or used twice [6]. These characteristics are \nto ensure the originality of the ticket purchased by \nuser.  However, a typical receipt system relies on the \nreliability of the merchant\u2019s system in getting the \ncorrect code and information about the wanted tickets. \nIt is lacking the on-device security protection. Once the \ntickets information is stored in the mobile phone it is \nvulnerable to attacks and information can be falsified.  \nFigure 2 illustrates a typical receipt model.    \nTherefore, there is a requirement to secure the \ninformation on the physical devices so that information \nreceived during the process is genuine and verifiable \nwithout relying solely upon the merchant.

M-ticketing with TrustZone  \nThis section defines the stages of operation for a \nnew model of mobile ticketing system to purchase a \nmovie ticket by using the TrustZone technology for on-\ndevice security protection. This solution secures \ncontent of the data stored on physical devices within \nthe mobile phone core-hardware. \n4.1 System implementation \n4.1.1 Purchasing ticket\nA user browses the internet using a mobile phone \nand selects the movie to watch and the preferred time. \nThis ticket is considered as time-based, as it is only \nvalid during the time of the movie is shown and \ntherefore a proof of purchase must be easily identified \nfor both user and cinema operator.  \n4.1.2 Payment process\nOnce the user agreed with the terms and conditions, \nthe user then makes a payment using mobile phone. \nThe process of sending the user\u2019s information is done \nbased on standard Internet security protocol Secure \nSocket Layer (SSL) which applies standard 128-bit \ndecryption over a wireless line. At this stage, the user \nsends the details to purchase the ticket to the operator\u2019s \nterminal. The user can make the payment directly to \nhis credit\/debit card or billing the amount of the ticket \npurchased on user\u2019s network provider or deduct user\u2019s \nprepaid amount. \n4.1.3 Encryption process\nUpon receiving the request of ticket(s) from the \nuser, the operator then sends an encrypted ticket \nelectronically to the user. Then, the encryption key is \nsent to the operator by the user\u2019s mobile phone.\nThe operator sends an encryption key to TrustZone \non the user\u2019s mobile phone to enable the user to open \nticket details. The operator should have a list of \n\u201ctrusted digital tickets\u201c which is processed using \nmobile phones with TrustZone technology. This \nenables the protection of on and off-chip memory and \nperipherals from software attack. Since the security \nelements of the system are designed into the core \nhardware, therefore there is no issue of ticket being \ntampered [5]. \n4.14 Ticket details and confirmation  \nBy using the encryption key stored in TrustZone, \nthe user can open and check the ticket details including \nunique ticket number, time of purchased, movie title, \nshow time and amount paid. Once the user satisfies and \nagrees with the information, the user sends \nacknowledgement to the operator. The ticket details \nwould be used as part of the encryption process so that \na new encryption key could be created by the merchant \nif required to validate a ticket. \n4.1.5 Cinema entrance using e-ticket\nThe user then passes the encrypted ticket to get \naccess to the appropriate movie entrance by connecting \ntheir mobile phone to the terminal available at the \ncounter via infrared or Bluetooth. This verifies the \nDelivery Entity Print Ticket \nTicket \ndetails \nOpen \nticket \nE-Ticket \nEncrypted key \nEncrypted key \nEncrypted ticket \nPayment process \nBrowse & buy \nMovie \nTicket \nOperator \nTrusted \ncode base \nMobile Phone Merchant \nSe\ncu\nre\n \nke\nrn\nel\n \nTicket \nBoothUser \nPlatform \nOS\nFigure 3.

The operator then \nprints out the physical ticket\/receipt to the user or \nprovides an instant access to the \u201ce-ticketer\u201d. \nThere should be no dispute of the originality of the \nticket as it is maintained encrypted within the user\u2019s \nmobile phone. The ticket details are still available and \naccessible and will enable the merchant to verify the \nencrypted ticket should they have lost the information \nfrom their system.  \nIn addition, the operator has less liability and \nresponsibility. If the operator\u2019s system fails during or \nafter the user purchased the ticket, the user has no \nproblem in entering the cinema because the proof of \nticket details are genuine as it is stored in the \nTrustZone. \n4.2 Benefits of proposed system\nWith the deployment of the TrustZone technology \nwithin a mobile phone, it is expected that the security \nof mobile commerce services will improve \nsignificantly particularly in the mobile ticketing \nsystem.  \nAt the moment, the only security that protects the \nmobile commerce transactions is solely dependent on \nthe gateway or tunnel security encryption when \ninformation is passed through from one end to another. \nBy introducing the embedded TrustZone technology \nwithin mobile phone hardware, it adds another layer of \nsecurity that gives on-device protection. This solution \nprotects sensitive data within the mobile phone to \nsecure the content of information on top of the existing \nsecurity channel in mobile commerce infrastructure.   \nData stored in TrustZone technology within a \nmobile phone is reliable and is not alterable by the user \nor anyone because the way it is secured within the \nhardware itself. Unlike many encryptions security \nsoftware in the market, TrustZone will not allow \ninformation kept in a mobile phone to be attacked by \nviruses and intruders to falsify the information. \n This mobile ticketing solution not only adds \nanother layer of security but also remains transparent \nto the end user because the data is stored in a secure \ndomain within the operating system [4]. As this \nsecurity protection happens in the background, user \nnever sees the add-on security and gives no different \nwhatsoever from user\u2019s point of view. In addition, it \nwill have no effect on the performance because the \nTrustZone works within the core hardware level.  \n5. Conclusion \nM-commerce offers a wide range of new mobile \napplications to consumers making life more convenient \nand providing easy access to information from a \nmobile phone. In order to increase the adoption of m-\ncommerce, it is vital to provide more secure \nenvironment for mobile transactions.  Therefore, this \npaper has introduced the deployment of TrustZone \ntechnology in a mobile phone that will add another \nlevel of security within the core hardware architecture.  \nThis would increase the level of confidence of the \nconsumers and benefit the wireless network providers, \napplication developers and manufacturers as they are \nable to offer better secure services to consumers. As a \nresult, more consumers are expected to engage in \nmobile commerce transactions which will contribute to \na wider adoption of mobile commerce services.  \n6.
