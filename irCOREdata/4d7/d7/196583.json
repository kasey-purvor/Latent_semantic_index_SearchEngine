Introduction\nRandom mutations, unless neutral to the phenotype,\nare much more likely to impair biological functions\nthan to improve them. This is often seen as a simple\nconsequence of a long history of natural selection,\nwhich has already fixed practically all beneficial mu-\ntations (Crow & Simmons, 1983). Another common\nfeature of mutations, especially the null ones, is their\nrecessivity. The latter results usually from basic fea-\ntures of the dynamics of metabolic pathways (Wright,\n1934; Kacser & Burns, 1981; Mayo & Bu\u00a8rger, 1997;\nBourguet, 1999). Thus, mutations tend to be del-\neterious and recessive, but do they interact with each\nother in ways that either reinforce or weaken their\nindividual effects (Kimura & Maruyama, 1966)? No\nstraightforward arguments or obvious observations\nare known to answer this question. Quantification\nof the above-mentioned three factors \u2013 selection co-\nefficients, degree of dominance, and direction and\nintensity of genetic interactions \u2013 is critical to under-\nstanding how natural selection works against the\n\u2018 load of mutations\u2019 (Muller, 1950). Genetic variation\nof mutational origin is likely to be ubiquitous, even in\npopulations well adapted to their environment. This is\nthe reason why deleterious mutations have attracted\nmuch attention and have been invoked to explain the\nevolution of several major biological phenomena.\nOne of these phenomena is diploidy.\nThe evolutionary advantage of diploidy is best evi-\ndenced by its widespread occurrence among both\nmulticellular and unicellular eukaryotes (Bell, 1982).\nIn diploid genomes, deleterious mutations can be\n\u2018masked\u2019 by non-mutated alleles. Masking ensures\nimmediate benefits for individuals but has long-term\ncosts for populations because mutations will persist\nfor a longer time (Haldane, 1937). The balance in the\nrelative length of haplo- and diplophase may be af-\nfected by several genetic and ecological factors, but the\ndegree of recessiveness of the mutated alleles is prob-\nably one of the most important (Kondrashov & Crow,\n1991; Perrot et al., 1991; Jenkins & Kirkpatrick,\n* Corresponding author. Tel : +48 12 2690944, ext. 131. Fax:\n+48 12 2690927. e-mail : korona@eko.uj.edu.pl\nGenet. Res., Camb. (2003), 82, pp. 19\u201331. With 5 figures. f 2003 Cambridge University Press 19\nDOI: 10.1017\/S001667230300630X Printed in the United Kingdom\n1995; Otto & Goldstein, 1992). Other phenomena\nwhose evolution is postulated to be explained by the\nexistence of deleterious mutations are sexual repro-\nduction and recombination. These may have evolved\nto strengthen selection against deleterious mutations,\nespecially if the mutations were frequent and their\nnegative effects reinforced by synergistic interaction\n(Feldman et al., 1980; Kondrashov, 1988; Barton,\n1995; Otto & Lenormand, 2002). In asexual organ-\nisms, mutations arise and are selected against in each\nclone independently. When populations are small,\nmutations can be fixed even in the most fit clone,\nleading to a gradual ratchet-like decrease in both the\nmaximum and average fitness (Muller, 1950). This\nprocess can develop into \u2018mutational meltdown\u2019 and,\nultimately, lead to population extinction (Gabriel\net al., 1993). The chances that the ratchet slows down\nor stops increase when mutational effects are sub-\nstantial and tend to interact synergistically (Charles-\nworth et al., 1993; Kondrashov, 1994). Among other\nintensively studied issues related to deleterious mu-\ntations are inbreeding depression (Fu & Ritland,\n1994; Dudash & Carr, 1998) and evolution of selfing\n(for a review see Charlesworth & Charlesworth,\n1998).\nIn the present paper we present an experimental\nstudy of the effects of dominance and epistasis. Sev-\neral statistical methods have been developed to\nquantify these factors (Lynch & Walsh, 1998). They\nare generally based on the analysis of variance com-\nponents. Therefore they provide only the means of\nestimated parameters and are subject to biases if as-\nsumptions of the quantitative genetics models are not\nmet. We applied a straightforward approach based\non simple genetic crosses in which we could directly\nestimate fitness of individual mutations in haploid,\nhomozygous and heterozygous loci.\nWe began with single deleterious mutations (one\nbase random substitutions) caused by ethyl methane-\nsulfonate (EMS) (Sega, 1984) obtained from a former\nstudy in which we examined a large number of diploid\nclones for the presence of a single allele generating\nvisible phenotypic effects in the haploid products of\nmeiosis (Wloch et al., 2001b). The other loci were\ngenerally isogenic and homozygous. If there were\nEMS-induced mutations other than the studied one,\ntheir phenotypic effects were not detectable under\nour assays. In the present experiments, we derived the\nwild-type and the mutated haploid clone from every\nheterozygote (except for the lethals). These hap-\nloids were then used in two types of experimental\ncrosses (Table 1). In order to test for \u2018dominance \u2019,\ncrosses were made between haploids derived from a\nsingle heterozygous mutant strain. A wild-type homo-\nzygote was obtained by crossing two wild-type hap-\nloids, a mutant homozygote by crossing two mutant\nhaploids, and a (new) heterozygote by crossing a wild-\ntype and a mutant haploid segregant. Because each\ntrio was derived from a single original heterozygous\nmutant it was possible to compare the three single-\nlocus genotypes on the same average genetic back-\nground. By this protocol, any cryptic mutations\npossibly residing on chromosomes or cytoplasmic\nelements would contribute equally to the average fit-\nness of wild-type homozygotes, mutant homozygotes\nand heterozygotes.\nIn an experiment designed to test for \u2018epistasis \u2019,\nhaploids derived from two different original hetero-\nzygous clones were mated (Table 1). In this case, two\nloci were involved and the diploids obtained were\neither wild-type homozygotes in both loci, hetero-\nzygous for mutations at one of the two loci, or het-\nerozygous for mutations at both loci. Again, the\ngenetic background was expected to be the same for\nTable 1.

Szafraniec et al. 20\nall four genotypes because it was derived in equal\nproportions from the same pair of original diploid\nclones. In yeast, mixing of genes in meiosis is efficient\ndue to segregation of 16 chromosomes and recombi-\nnation at about 100 cross-overs per meiosis (Roeder,\n1995; Borts et al., 2000; Abdullah & Borts, 2001).\nIn addition to the study of dominance and epistasis\nin diploids, we also wanted to compare fitness effects\nof mutations in haploid and heterozygous diploid\nclones. This is similar to but not the same as a\ncomparison between homozygous and heterozygous\ndiploid mutant strains. Both in haploids and in\nhomozygous mutant strains the masking effect of a\nwild-type allele is absent. However, phenotypes of,\nand challenges faced by, the two genetic phases differ\nin a number of significant aspects (Sherman, 1997;\nGalitski et al., 1999). For example, in normal cir-\ncumstances, only haploids begin growth by germi-\nnating from a spore. The germinating haploids have\nto re-start metabolism, and this challenging situation\nis more likely to uncover genetic defects (Wendland,\n2001). Finally and most importantly, comparisons\nbetween haploids and diploids were necessary to in-\nclude haplo-lethal mutations in the study. Such lethal\nmutants could not have been used in crosses such as\nthose described above (Table 1). Therefore, in order\nto estimate the effect of heterozygous lethal mu-\ntations, two samples of diploid clones were compared:\none group was known to bear single heterozygous\nlethal alleles and the other was free of them.\n2. Materials and methods\n(i) Strains\nThe initial diploid strain was essentially homozygous\nat all loci except for the mating type locus which was\nMATa\/MATa. Homozygosity was obtained by a\nseries of 10 sequential backcrosses to the same \u2018wild-\ntype\u2019 strain (Wloch et al., 2001b). The only loci\nknown not to be wild-type were three auxotrophic loci\n(ura3, leu2 and trp1) and theHO (homothalism) gene.\nThe latter was inactive, ho, which allows stable\nmaintenance of the mating type of haploid clones.\nA colony developed from a single cell was used to\ninitiate a liquid culture and grown overnight. A 1 ml\naliquot of this culture was treated with 2 ml of EMS\nfor 1 h and then washed to terminate mutagenesis. A\nlarge sample of mutagenized culture was used to in-\noculate fresh medium in which eight generations of\ngrowth were completed. From this, replicate clones\nwere obtained. Samples were diluted and spread as\nsingle cells on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone,\n2% glucose) agar surface. The resulting colonies were\nreplica-plated onto sporulation medium (1% potass-\nium acetate, 0.05% glucose, 0.1% yeast extract, re-\nquired supplements) where, after some additional\ngrowth, diploid cells underwent meiosis and devel-\noped into tetrads of haploid spores.\nA single tetrad was chosen at random from each\ncolony. The four spores were separated on a fresh\nYPD plate and grown into colonies. Most clones exhi-\nbited wild-type formation because the concentration\nof EMS was low. When a 2 : 2 segregation pattern\nfor viability or small colony size was discovered\nwithin a tetrad, the parental diploid clone was con-\nsidered to have a single mutation in a heterozygous\nlocus. Such a pattern would also be produced if two\nclones within one tetrad happened to be altered due\nto purely phenotypic and not genetic reasons. Wloch\net al. (2001b) provide extensive statistical arguments\nthat such false 2 : 2 segregations were rare, such that\nover 90% of clones identified in this manner con-\ntained a single mutation. For the purpose of the\npresent experiments, we repeated the tetrad analysis\nof the previously identified heterozygous diploids to\nconfirm that all clones used in the following crosses\ndid indeed contain a single mutation. The methods\napplied in this verification are described in the fol-\nlowing section.\n(ii) Verification of mutants\nSamples of diploid clones that had been identified by\nWloch et al. as containing single heterozygous mu-\ntations were kept at x70 xC. The present study was\ninitiated by thawing these samples and spreading to\nsingle cells on YPD plates. A single colony of every\nclone was transferred onto sporulation medium.\nThree to nine tetrads per colony were dissected on a\nfresh YPD plate. After 48 h of incubation at 30 xC,\nthe sizes of the resulting haploid colonies were as-\nsessed visually. The tetrads were grouped into five\nclasses : (i) no visible mutation pattern, which usually\nmeant that all four colonies were of normal wild-\ntype size ; (ii) two normal and two slightly smaller\nthan normal size colonies ; (iii) two normal and two\nmedium-sized colonies ; (iv) two normal and two small\ncolonies ; (v) two normal and two dead colonies. A\nmutation was considered as positively verified if the\nreplicate tetrads of a given clone showed the expected\n2 : 2 pattern, i.e. two of four colonies were smaller in a\nsimilar degree as seen by Wloch et al. (2001b).\nA subset of clones was verified more thoroughly by\nmeasuring under r40 magnification the sizes of the\nhaploid colonies obtained after tetrad dissection. This\nallowed quantitative comparison of the growth effects\nof the mutations obtained in the present study with\nthose estimated by Wloch et al. (2001b).\nThe above assays, both qualitative and quantitat-\nive, were performed in order to verify the presence\nof single mutations and to identify the necessary hap-\nloid clones. From every diploid with a verified non-\nlethal mutation in a heterozygous locus, four haploids\nDominance and epistasis in yeast 21\nwere obtained: MATa and MATa of a \u2018wild-type\u2019\nphenotype, andMATa andMATa of a \u2018mutant \u2019 one.\nThese were subsequently used as described below.\nPrecise measurements of the growth rate of all the\nresulting clones were obtained according to a uniform\nprotocol described in section (vi), \u2018Fitness assays and\ncomparisons\u2019.\n(iii) Crosses\nThe experimental crosses carried out in this study are\npresented in Table 1. For a test of dominance, crosses\ninvolved two haploids of opposite mating types that\nwere derived from one heterozygous diploid clone.\nThe locus, which is putatively mutated, is denoted by\ni. The alleles at the locus are denoted by w (wild-type)\nor m (mutant). After the appropriate matings, three\ndiploid clones were obtained: a wild-type homo-\nzygote, iw\/iw, a mutant homozygote, im\/im, and a het-\nerozygote, iw\/im. Because both the haploids to be\ncrossed and the resulting diploids had the same\nmarkers, complementation could not be used to select\nor screen for diploids. Therefore, two haploids were\nmixed, grown overnight on a YPD plate, and then\nspread to single cells on a new YPD plate. A number\nof resulting colonies were transferred onto sporu-\nlation medium and checked for sporulation, a marker\nof diploidy. Several matings, primarily those involving\ntwo mutants, did not yield diploids despite repeated\nefforts. This may mean that mating was impaired\nor that sporulation efficiency was very low. These un-\nsuccessful crosses could bias our results only if mu-\ntations affectingmating or sporulation were associated\nwith a specific effect on dominance or epistasis. There\nare no theoretical or experimental reasons to believe\nthis to be true.\nThe study of epistasis was begun by random\nmatching of two diploid clones, i and j, that were\nconfirmed to have single heterozygous mutations.\nEach clone was used only once. A pair of haploid\nclones, wild-type and mutant, obtained from the i\nheterozygote were iwjw and imjw, respectively. An\nanalogous pair from the j heterozygous diploid were\niwjw and iwjm (Table 1). In the subsequent matings,\nhaploids with the different genotypes were mated to\nobtain a homozygous wild-type iwjw\/iwjw, two single\nheterozygous mutants imjw\/iwjw and iwjm\/iwjw, and a\ndouble heterozygous mutant, imjw\/iwjm.\n(iv) Lethal mutations\nA number of clones from the collection of Wloch et al.\n(2001b) that were previously identified as hetero-\nzygous for a single lethal allele were verified using the\nprotocol described above. As a control, a similar\nnumber of diploid clones that yielded four normal-\nlooking haploids were chosen. These clones were also\nsubject to verification to ensure that they were indeed\nfree of mutations. Both the heterozygous lethals and\nthe control wild-types came from the same EMS-\ntreated culture. Therefore, any very small, and thus\ninvisible, mutational effects potentially present should\nhave been, on average, the same in both groups.\n(v) Haploids versus heterozygotes\nComparisons between haploid and heterozygous dip-\nloid clones were made by using data obtained from\ntwo studies. The data on heterozygous effects were\ncollected from the present estimates gathered in both\nthe dominance and epistasis studies. The estimates\nof haploid fitness, for both lethal and non-lethal mu-\ntations, came from our earlier experiments (Wloch\net al., 2001b). We chose the former haploid fitness\nestimates over the ones performed in the present study\nbecause the latter were most often qualitative esti-\nmates obtained simply to confirm that the expected\nphenotype was present.\n(vi) Fitness assays and comparisons\nFitness of every clone was estimated as an average\ngrowth rate of a colony initiated by a single cell and\nincubated for 48 h at 30 xC. In our previous study,\nsuch an approach was natural because the tetrads\nwere dissected to single haploid spores and placed at\nregular intervals on fresh YPD plates (Wloch et al.,\n2001b). In this experiment, the aim was to measure\ngrowth rate of diploids in conditions as similar as\npossible to that used for haploids. Single vegetative\ndiploid cells were moved with the aid of a micro-\nmanipulator and placed in fixed order on YPD agar in\n90 mm Petri dishes. To make all positions uniform,\nthe cells were laid at the same distance from the center\nof a plate on 12 evenly spaced points (Fig. 1). Samples\nof clones were put in the middle of a plate before be-\ning dispersed. The centre of the plate was sub-\nsequently removed so that the patches growing from\nthe superfluous cells could not interfere with the col-\nonies being assayed. The plates were photographed\nafter 48 h of incubation using a digital camera. The\narea of every colonywas then estimated using an image\nprocessing program. The estimate of the area was used\nto calculate colony volume. The shape of a colony was\nassumed to be hemispherical. While this is a simplifi-\ncation, the proportional volumes of colonies can be\nassessed correctly from the areas of their bases, as\nlong as they are isomorphic. Although a few colonies\nwere not isomorphic, we did not observe any large\ndeviations, such as very flat or exceedingly steep-sided\ncolonies, which might invalidate this assumption. The\ncalculated volume was then divided by 1.7r10x7 ml,\nthe approximate volume occupied by a typical dip-\nloid cell within a colony (Sherman, 1991). From the\nK. Szafraniec et al. 22\nnumber of cells, N, the number of divisions was\ncalculated as log2N and then divided by 48 h. This\nyielded an estimate of the average rate of growth\nexpressed as the number of doublings per hour.\nA single plate contained clones resulting from one\nset of crosses. In the study of the dominance of non-\nlethal mutations, an array of cells of the three geno-\ntypes (iw\/iw, im\/im, iw\/im) was repeated four times\naround a circle. This resulted in 12 colonies, unless\nsome of the cells were inviable (Fig. 1). Plates with\nmany missing colonies were redone. The average\ngrowth rate of the four (sometimes three, rarely two)\nwild-type homozygous (iw\/iw) colonies was calculated.\nSimilar calculations were performed separately for the\nhomozygous and heterozygous strains. The relative\nfitness, w, of wild-types was set to 1. The relative fit-\nness of im\/im and of iw\/im was calculated as the ratio of\naverage growth rate of a given clone to the average\ngrowth rate of iw\/iw from the same plate. In fact,\ngrowth rate is only one component of fitness, al-\nthough an important one. Through the rest of the text\nthe term \u2018fitness \u2019 will mean relative fitness or, strictly\nspeaking, relative growth rate. In general, a single\nplate constituted an experimental block, in which the\nthree clones were the compared groups, and the four\ncells were replicates.\nThis experimental design was applied to the two\nother experiments. As described above, dominance of\nthe lethal mutations was studied by comparing het-\nerozygotes, iw\/im, with diploids without any visible\nFig. 1. An example of a plate with diploid clones positioned at 12 points. The plate contains clones resulting from a\nsingle mutation-cross (see Table 1 for details). An array of three clones \u2013 wild-type homozygote (+\/+), mutant\nhomozygote (m\/m) and mutant heterozygote (+\/m) \u2013 is repeated four times clockwise around the plate.

The average growth rate of the iwiw\ncolonies was set to 1 and used to calculate the relative\nfitness of heterozygotes. In the third experiment, the\nstudy of epistasis, an array of four clones \u2013 a wild-\ntype iwjw\/iwjw, two single mutants imjw\/iwjw, iwjm\/iwjw,\nand a double mutant imjw\/iwjm \u2013 was repeated three\ntimes per plate. Two such plates were assayed per\neach pair of i and j. For the test of epistasis, two\nhigher-order averages were calculated for a single\nplate. One was the \u2018disassociation\u2019 mean, i.e. an av-\nerage relative fitness of two single heterozygotes,\nimjw\/iwjw and iwjm\/iwjw, that can be expressed as\n[(1xsi)+(1xsj)]\/2=1x(si+sj)\/2. The other was the\n\u2018association\u2019 mean, i.e. an average relative fitness of a\nwild-type, iwjw\/iwjw, and a double heterozygote, imjw\/\niwjm. The association mean can be expressed as\n[1+(1xsixsj+sirj)]\/2. It becomes equal to the dis-\nassociation mean, 1x(si+sj)\/2, if there is no effect of\ninteraction, sirj=0. The data were analysed with a\ntwo-way ANOVA where the relationship of the mu-\ntations (associated or disassociated) and the cross\n(a pair of i and j) were the major effects and the two\nplates were replicates.\n3.

The\nmean haploid relative fitness was 0.512 in the original\nassay and 0.513 in the present one. The difference\nwas statistically insignificant (t=0.019, df=146, P=\n0.985). Individual estimates were also little changed\nbetween the two assays (Fig. 2). Correlation between\nthe two measurements was high (r=0.825, n=74,\nt=12.462, P<0.001), especially considering that the\nsecond assay was done a year later, after another\nround of thawing, growth, sporulation and digestion\nof asci. The few strong deviations might result not\nfrom an experimental error or phenotypic variation\nbut from true genetic differences. The latter could\nhappen when a colony that was thought to contain\none clone with a single mutation was in fact founded\nby two or more genetically different cells. Thus it is\npossible that the original assays done by Wloch et al.\n(2001b) and the present assays involved different\nclones from such a mixed colony. Another possibility\nis that spontaneousmutations occurring during colony\ngrowth or freezing are a source of genetic polymor-\nphism. These should be rare, however, because the pre-\nsent assays involved just a few dozens of generations\nand the spontaneous mutation rate per generation\nwas estimated at 1.1r10x3 (Wloch et al., 2001b).\nThe rest of the clones used in the present ex-\nperiments were not subject to precise growth rate\nmeasurements but assigned to one of four mutant\nphenotypes (lethal, severe, moderate, slightly del-\neterious). In over 90% of comparisons it was found\nthat the re-assayed phenotype was quantitatively\nsimilar to that originally observed. Only the positively\nverified clones were used in the experiments reported\nbelow.\n(ii) Dominance of non-lethal mutations\nThe relation between homozygous and heterozygous\nfitness is shown in Fig. 3. The homozygous selection\ncoefficient, s, of a given mutation was calculated as\nthe difference in relative fitness between the wild-type,\niw\/iw, and the homozygous mutant, im\/im. An anal-\nogous difference between the wild-type and the het-\nerozygote, im\/iw, was taken as an estimate of hs, where\nh stands for the coefficient of dominance. The mean hs\nwas significantly lower than the mean s in a paired\ncomparison (hs=0.0042, s=0.0213, t=x5.182,\ndf=81, P<0.001). The mean coefficient of dominance\ncalculated as the ratio hs\/s was 0.197.\nThe average standard errors of individual estimates\nof s and hs were 0.0051 and 0.0044, respectively.\nTherefore the negative values of some individual es-\ntimates of these two parameters probably indicate the\nmeasurement errors and not genetic effects resulting\nin an increased relative fitness (Fig. 3). A similar in-\nterpretation is likely to be true for the apparent fitness\nincreases in the study of epistasis (Fig. 4) and in the\ncomparison between haploids and heterozygotes\n(Fig. 5).\n(iii) Epistasis of non-lethal mutations\nThis experiment tested the fitness effect of combining\nheterozygous mutations at two loci, im\/iw and jm\/jw.\nThe effects of the mutations on growth rate would be\nadditive if the average fitness of two clones each\nbearing one such locus (disassociation) were equal\nto the average of two other clones, one with none\nand the other with both mutations (association). Since\nthe calculations of growth rates are based on a log-\narithmic function, additivity of the growth rates is\nequivalent tomultiplicity of non-logarithmicmeasures\nof fitness. For this reason, we judge single-locus ef-\nfects multiplicative based on their additivity in terms\nof statistics. A result where the association average\nwas lower than the disassociation average would\nmean synergism. Antagonism would be indicated by\nthe opposite relationship. The results of an ANOVA\ntest are presented in Table 2. Table 2 shows that one\nof the two major effects, the particular mutations,\nexplained as much as 78% of genetic variation, while\nthe other, the type of association, did not contribute\nat all. Interaction between these two factors was\nK. Szafraniec et al. 24\nstatistically significant and explained 22% of the\ngenetic variation. This implies that some loci tended\nto interact synergistically and some antagonistically\nbut that there was no average departure from multi-\nplicative action of effects. The disassociation and\nassociation means would be distributed along a diag-\nonal line y=x if their deviation from the predicted\nvalues were random (Fig. 4). The actual principal\nmajor axis was y=0.291+0.709x. The upper and\nlower limits for 95% confidence limits of the slope\nwere 1.024 and 0.465, respectively (Sokal & Rohlf,\n1995). Thus, the upper bound barely overlaps with the\nslope of the diagonal, leaving the null hypothesis\nviable.\n(iv) Lethals, and haploids versus diploids\nThe relationship between growth effects of the same\nmutation residing in a haploid or heterozygous dip-\nloid locus is shown graphically in Fig. 5.

The heterozygous selection coefficient of\nthe lethal mutation, hs, was estimated by subtracting\nthe relative fitness of a mutant heterozygote from that\nof a wild-type homozygote (the latter also set to 1). hs\nfor the lethal mutations (and thus also their h) was\nvery low, at 0.0034.\nThe heterozygous selection coefficient was calcu-\nlated separately, but in the same way, for the non-\nlethal mutations. It was found to be hs=0.0048. (The\nfigure of 0.0048 is somewhat different from the 0.0042\nreported in section (ii), \u2018Dominance of non-lethal\nmutations\u2019, because the present estimate is based\non the heterozygous fitness estimates collected from\nboth the dominance and epistasis studies. See also\nSection 2, Materials and methods.) The heterozygous\neffects of the lethal and non-lethal mutations, 0.0048\nand 0.0034, are statistically indistinguishable (t=\n0.665, df=169, P=0.507). This suggests that the\nlethal mutations were about 8 times more successfully\n\u2018masked\u2019 than the non-lethal ones. The last con-\nclusion can be made relating the average haploid\nselection coefficient of the lethal mutations, s=1, and\nthat of the non-lethal mutations used in this com-\nparison, s=0.1214.\n4. Discussion\n(i) Dominance\nMost of the mutations studied in the present exper-\niments were strongly recessive. The average selection\ncoefficient against single heterozygous deleterious,\nand even lethal, mutations was lower than half a per\ncent. Two features of the experimental system made it\npossible to study such small effects. One was the op-\nportunity to carry out crosses in a way ensuring that\nthe genetic background was homogenized and did not\ninterfere with the small effects studied. The other was\nthe way in which growth rate was measured. Single\ncells were used to initiate growing colonies. Therefore\neven small differences in the rate of growth translated\nto (roughly) exponentially growing differences in\ncolony sizes, making the latter measurable.\n(ii) Dominance of non-lethal mutations: an overview\nThe coefficient of dominance, h, was about 0.2 or 0.3\ndepending on the method of calculation used. Thus,\nthe masking effect of a wild-type allele does not\nappear to be very strong when weakly deleterious\nmutations are considered.\n0\u00b7985 0\u00b7990 0\u00b7995\n0\u00b7995\n0\u00b7990\n0\u00b7985\n1\n1\u00b7005\n1\u00b7010\n1\u00b7005 1\u00b7010\nDisassociation\nA\nss\noc\nia\nti\non\nFig. 4. Epistasis experiment. An \u2018association\u2019 estimate was calculated as the mean relative fitness of a wild-type and a\ndouble heterozygous mutant obtained from a given cross (irj). \u2018Disassociation\u2019 is the mean fitness of the two single\nheterozygotes resulting from the same cross.\nK. Szafraniec et al. 26\nEstimates of the dominance coefficients available\nfor other organisms also suggest that small mu-\ntational effects are only moderately masked by wild-\ntype alleles. The classic estimates of Mukai (1964) and\nMukai et al. (1972) suggested that in D. melanogaster\nsmall viability effects caused by new mutations were\nonly slightly recessive, h=0.4. This somewhat un-\nexpectedly high dominance was confirmed in inde-\npendent experiments by Ohnishi (1977a, b) although\nthose results have recently been questioned. When\nGarcia-Dorado & Caballero (2000) reanalysed these\ntwo data-sets they argued that the estimate of h was\nabout twofold lower. However, the original obser-\nvation of the relatively high dominance of new mu-\ntations is supported by other work (Chavarr\u0131\u00b4as et al.,\n2001). The value of h tended to be generally lower\nand more variable, however, when traits other than\nviability were studied in Drosophila (Ferna\u00b4ndez &\nLopez-Fanjul, 1996; Houle et al., 1997). The values\ndiscussed above were obtained for spontaneous mu-\ntants. EMS mutagenesis yielded deleterious alleles\nwith dominance coefficients of 0.1\u20130.3 (Ohnishi,\n1977a, b). Among other invertebrates in which the im-\npact of spontaneous mutations on fitness was studied\nare cladocerans and round-worms. In Caenorhabditis,\nthe average dominance coefficient of mutations del-\neterious to fecundity was probably between 0.1 and\n0.5 (Vassilieva et al., 2000). The estimates cited above\nwere obtained in experiments where methods other\nthan crosses of single mutations were applied. The\nmutations were usually accumulated in long-term ex-\nperiments or sampled from extant populations. This\nwas often followed by rounds of inbreeding. The exact\nnumber of mutations involved was generally not\nknown. Nevertheless, both the reviewed studies and\nour data consistently show that alleles with small fit-\nness effects retain approximately a quarter of their\nimpact on fitness in heterozygotes.\nDominance of deleterious mutations in yeast has\npreviously been estimated. Korona (1999b) obtained\nhaploid strains that contained dozens of mutations\naccumulated during hundreds of generations of\ngrowth with an impaired DNA mismatch repair sys-\ntem. Although a mutational load was evidenced by\na considerable drop in fitness, the strains were also\nknown to have compensatory mutations that ameli-\norated some of the harmful effects. Such haploid\nclones were used in crosses with wild-type clones and\nthe coefficient of dominance was found to be h=0.08.\nThis value is lower than the present one, but it is less\nreliable because of the fact that mutations were nu-\nmerous and not always deleterious. Mable & Otto\n(2001) compared haploid and diploid yeast cultures\ntreated with EMS. The relatively large populations\nemployed in that study could result in a loss of the\nmore harmful mutations. The estimate of h=0.30 that\nthey calculated is close to that obtained in the present\nstudy for mutations with small effects. Other studies\nemploying yeast strains with numerous deleterious\nmutations suggest that the estimates of both s and hs\n0\u00b716\n0\u00b714\n0\u00b712\n0\u00b710\n0\u00b708\n0\u00b706\n0\u00b704\n0\u00b702\n0\n\u20130\u00b702\n0\u00b71 0\u00b72 0\u00b73 0\u00b74 0\u00b75 0\u00b76 0\u00b77 0\u00b78 0\u00b79\ns of haploids\nhs\n o\nf \nhe\nte\nro\nzy\ngo\nte\ns\nFig. 5.

Fitness effects are expressed as s for haploids and hs for heterozygous diploids.\nThe lethal haploid phenotypes are grouped at the right side of the graph because their s was set to 1.\nDominance and epistasis in yeast 27\nare dependent on environment. Harsh conditions tend\nto magnify the negative effects of mutations in both\nhaploids and heterozygous diploids (Korona, 1999a ;\nSzafraniec et al., 2001).\n(iii) Epistasis\nThe mean fitness of two clones each carrying a single\nmutation (disassociation) was the same as the mean\nfitness of a double wild-type and a double mutant\nclone (association). This indicates an absence of gen-\netic interaction. The mutations were in heterozygous\ncondition and, consequently, the differences in fitness\nwere slight. The most and the least fit clones differed\nby less than 2% of their relative fitness (Fig. 4). This is\nan important feature of the present experiments be-\ncause such small effects would be especially difficult to\nstudy with organisms other than yeast. Most of the\ngenetic variation was attributable to differences be-\ntween crosses, i.e. fitness was determined by a pair of\nparticular mutations irrespective of whether they were\nin association or disassociation. These two findings\nmean that the growth rate effects are additive. As\nalready mentioned in Section 3, this implies multi-\nplicative action of deleterious mutational effects be-\ncause additivity of growth rates means multiplicity of\nnon-logarithmic measures of fitness, such as the num-\nber of progeny. Only about one-fifth of the variation\nwas attributable to the genetic interaction (Table 2).\nThis interaction was generally random, that is, esti-\nmates were distributed along a diagonal (Fig. 4).\nEpistasis of neither the \u2018diminishing returns\u2019 nor \u2018 in-\ncreasing returns\u2019 type was visible. This result was ob-\ntained with a very narrow range of relative fitness and\na minimum number of interacting loci. Perhaps in-\nteraction between many loci or loci with large effects\nwould be different. However, in a large equilibrium\npopulation the differences in fitnesses would also be\nsmall. The present data offer insight into the genetic\ninteractions in individuals close to a \u2018wild-type\u2019 pheno-\ntype. They suggest that the phenotypes of these geno-\ntypes are not greatly influenced by the antagonistic or\n(with even higher certainty) the synergistic interaction\nof deleterious mutations.\nPrevious studies of the epistatic interactions of\ndeleterious mutations have most often been done with\nhaploids or homozygous diploids.Mukai (1969) found\nsynergism of spontaneous deleterious mutations in\nfruit flies, although the validity of his data has been\ndebated on several occasions (Shabalina et al., 1997;\nFry et al., 1999; Keightley & Eyre-Walker, 1999;\nFry, 2001). The authors of other studies, involving\nChlamydomonas (de Visser et al., 1997a), higher plants\n(de Visser & Hoekstra, 1998), RNA viruses (Elena,\n1999), nematodes (Peters & Keightley, 2000) and\nhaploid yeast (Wloch et al., 2001a) also detected some\nsigns of synergism although they all noted that their\nresults were equivocal. As an alternative to the studies\nof random mutations, Elena & Lenski (1997) inserted\ngenetic markers into defined positions of the E. coli\ngenome. Bohannan et al. (1999) studied interactions\nbetween mutations conferring resistance of E. coli\nclones to bacteriophages. In yet another study, de\nVisser et al. (1997b) focused on existing chromosomal\nmarkers in Aspergillus. In these studies, there were\ninteractions in both directions but no overall trend\nto synergism was seen. In a recent experiment, Yang\net al. (2001) mutagenized laboratory populations of\nfruit flies with EMS and did not detect epistasis\namong heterozygous loci. Our results, also obtained\nwith heterozygous loci, further weaken the evidence\nfor synergism as a common and prevailing type of\ninteraction among deleterious mutations.\n(iv) Lethals, and haploids versus diploids\nThe fitness effects of mutations were much more\nvisible in haploids than in diploids. This might be\nexpected when haploids are compared with hetero-\nzygotes, but not necessarily expected when haploids\nare compared with homozygous mutant diploids. For\nexample, the x-axis of the graph in Fig. 3 represents a\nsample of homozygous mutants. The mean s of the\nnon-lethal mutations in homozygous diploids, 0.0213,\nTable 2.

Szafraniec et al. 28\nis considerably and statistically significantly smaller\nthan the mean s of the very same mutations in hap-\nloids, 0.080: t=3.501, df=72, P<0.001. (The value\nreported here, s=0.080, is smaller than the 0.1214\nprovided in the last line of Section 3 because in the\npresent case only the haploid mutants that were used\nto form mutant homozygotes are considered. Some of\nthe haploids containing severe mutations could not\nmate with an isogenic haploid of opposite mating type\nalthough they could mate with a wild-type and yield\na heterozygote. See also section (iii) \u2018Crosses \u2019 in\nSection 2.) It might be premature to conclude that\ndeleterious mutations are simply about 4 times less\nharmful in diploids than in haploids. The haploid\nclones were initiated from spores and therefore their\nfitness was affected both by the duration of germi-\nnation and by the rate of subsequent growth. It usually\ntakes about 4 h to complete germination but this time\ncan vary substantially. It is likely that selective disad-\nvantage of the haploid clones was sometimes caused\nby metabolic defects that interfered with germination\nbut not, or much less, with vegetative growth. There-\nfore, the haploids and diploids would differ less in\ntheir selection coefficients if the vegetative growth\ndominated in both genetic phases and germination\nwere a rare event.\nFitness of many heterozygous mutants was practi-\ncally unaffected (Figs 3\u20135). This finding can partly\nexplain the result obtained by Zeyl et al. (2001), whose\nmutator lines of diploid yeast accumulated mutations\nfor 3000 generations and yet had a decrease in com-\npetitive ability that was undetectable in most of the\nlines. It also shows the important role of sporulation\nand mating within an ascus, which is more frequent\nthan out-crossing in wild S. cerevisiae (Mortimer et al.,\n1994). Intra-ascal mating results in homozygosity of\nmutations that would be essentially immune to natu-\nral selection in heterozygotes. Although the similarity\nof heterozygous fitness of the lethal and non-lethal\nmutations was striking in the present experiment, this\nphenomenon is probably not constrained to yeast. It\nhas already been reported for Drosophila (reviewed\nby Mukai et al., 1972; Crow & Simmons, 1983) and\nsuggested for Daphnia (Lynch et al., 1998).\nA proper study of deleterious mutations requires\nthat they are sheltered from selection before their\nselective value is estimated. Otherwise, the studied\nspectrum of mutations is different from that actually\noccurring. In this experimental system, mutagenesis\nwas followed by eight generations of growth in a mass\nculture when mutations with large heterozygous ef-\nfects would be out-competed. However, there were\nactually only approximately five generations of selec-\ntion because the peak of mutant phenotypes occurs\nat the third generation after EMS treatment (Klein\net al., 1989, 1990). Mutations with heterozygous ef-\nfects on the order of 0.10 or greater would be reduced\nin frequency by about a half after five generations of\ngrowth. There was only one such mutation among the\n174 tested (Fig. 5). Of course, there could have been\ndominant, or partially dominant, lethal or seriously\nharmful mutations that would escape our assays.\nSuch mutations would pose a problem to every ex-\nperiment, however, and it is practically impossible to\ndetermine whether they in fact happen at an appreci-\nable rate. A clear finding of the present study is that\nnew mutations are readily detectable in haploids and\nvery well masked in heterozygous diploids. It adds\nstrength to our recent estimates of the mutation rate\nand distribution of fitness effects in budding yeast\n(Wloch et al., 2001b).\nWe thank S. P. Otto for valuable comments.
