From its inception in 1965,1,2 this\nmodel of inflammation has been used to assess how drugs,3\nbioactive compounds in dentifrices4-6 and environmental\ntoxins, such as tobacco smoke,7,8 affect the development of\ninflammation. The model is designed to enable the study of\nboth the induction and resolution of inflammation, which can\nalso be assessed over a relatively short period of time (35 days)\nand in a controlled manner.\nThe model involves periodontally and systemically healthy\nvolunteers, who do not brush specified test teeth in one sextant\nof the dentition, but continue to brush the remaining control teeth\nover a 21 day period. Accidental brushing of test teeth is prevented\nby the use of a vinyl shield (mouth guard) to cover them during\ncleaning. On day 21, the accumulated plaque on all teeth is\nremoved by a trained hygienist and study participants resume\ntheir normal oral hygiene practices. Clinical assessment of plaque\naccumulation and gingival inflammation are made at baseline,\nday 7, 14, 21 on test and control teeth, following plaque ac-\ncumulation on test teeth, and normal plaque removal from\ncontrol teeth. Assessments are repeated again on day 35, following\n14 days of resolution of inflammation at test sites, and mainte-\nnance of health at control sites. When performed by trained and\ncalibrated experts, these measures show consistent increases in\nplaque-induced inflammation up to day 21 followed by a return\nto baseline, preinflammation levels at day 35.9,10 However none\nof these assessments could potentially form the basis for a\npredictor of disease as they are all measures of existing inflam-\nmation or inducers of inflammation.\n* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

This fluid flows from the crevice\nbetween the tooth and the gum and comprises both a serum\ntransdate11 and tissue exudates.3,10,12-14 During inflammation,\nthe volume and flow of this fluid increases,1 and this alone can\nbe used to demonstrate induction and\/or presence of gingivitis\nand periodontitis. However, due to its very nature, as a mixed\nserum transudate and tissue exudate, GCF carries with it\nproteins from the crevice. Thus its composition also provides\na biological and pathological fingerprint of the various physi-\nological and biochemical processes occurring within the gin-\ngival tissues. In 1980, Novaes et al.15 demonstrated that the\ntotal protein present in GCF increased with increasing severity\nof periodontitis, although this was probably due to increases\nin GCF volume. By 1985, Lamster et al.16 had measured\ndifferences in lactate dehydrogenase, beta-glucuronidase and\narylsulfatase activity in GCF collected from experimental\ngingivitis sites and demonstrated increases in these biomarkers\nover the course of the 21 day study. Since then, studies have\ntargeted particular cytokines,3,10,12-14,17,18 antibacterial peptides\nand proteins19 and many more individual proteins and\npeptides,9,20-22 revealing increases in pro-inflammatory species\nduring disease. Studies have also examined the effect of\ndiseases, such as type I diabetes mellitus,23 analysis of many\nanti-inflammatory or antimicrobial compounds, and environ-\nmental conditions, such as smoking,8 on experimental gingivitis.\nRecently, proteomics techniques have greatly increased\nunderstanding of the composition of GCF. Surface enhanced\nlaser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry\n(SELDI TOF MS) has been used to examine small proteins and\npeptides (2.5-30 kDa) from healthy volunteers and gingivitis\npatients.24 That study employed a targeted approach to inves-\ntigate neutrophil defensins. Unfractionated GCF samples were\nalso examined by matrix assisted laser desorption\/ionization\n(MALDI)-TOF MS, for neutrophil defensins.25 Similarly, Pisano\net al26 used electrospray ionization27 (ESI)-MS to examine the\nacid-soluble protein content of GCF from healthy volunteers.\nThey, too, identified the neutrophil defensins, along with\ncystatin A, statherin and serum albumin. Only in the last year\nhave tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) techniques been\nemployed in the examination of GCF. Ngo et al.28 used both\nMALDI-TOF\/TOF and ESI-MS\/MS to identify 66 proteins that\nhad been separated by gel electrophoresis from a single patient,\nwho had a history of periodontal disease but who was in the\nmaintenance phase following treatment. Proteins identified\nincluded a number of serum-derived proteins, such as albumin,\ncomplement and transferrin. Other proteins that were present\nincluded: antimicrobial proteins calgranulin A and B; amylase;\ncytatin S; and Histone H4. Bostanci et al.29 used a LC-MSE\nlabel-free quantitative technique to identify 154 proteins from\neither healthy volunteers or patients with aggressive periodon-\ntitis. Bostanci et al.29 identified a wide range of proteins\nincluding those mentioned already and a large number of\nkeratins, immunoglobulins, and other intracellular proteins.\nThey also potentially identified a number of bacterial, fungal\nand viral proteins.\nThe majority of mass spectrometry-based proteomics is\nperformed using the bottom-up30 liquid chromatography\ntandemmass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) approach. Generally,\nproteins are digested with trypsin prior to online LC separation.\nAs the peptides elute into the mass spectrometer, they are\nfragmented typically by collision induced dissociation31 (CID)\nresulting in b and y ion series.32 The MS\/MS spectra are\nsearched against protein databases by use of algorithms (e.g.,\nMascot,33 SEQUEST,34 OMSSA35) which match the data to\ntheoretical spectra from in-silico digests of proteins. Quantita-\ntive proteomics by mass spectrometry can use several methods.\nTwo of the most popular are stable isotope labeled amino acids\nin cell culture36 (SILAC) and isobaric tags for relative and\nabsolute quantitation (iTRAQ).37 In SILAC, cells are grown in\nmedia lacking essential amino acids. The media is supple-\nmented with heavy or light amino acids. The labeled and\nunlabeled peptides elute together and the intensity of the\npeptide ions can be compared. SILAC is not suitable for clinical\nsamples. A common approach for quantitation of biological\nfluids38 and tissue samples39 is postdigestion labeling with\niTRAQ40 labels. iTRAQ labels consist of a reporter ion with a\nm\/z value of between 113 and 121 and a balance mass\n(191-183 Da) such that all labeled peptides of the same\nsequence have the same nominal mass shift (\u2206304 Da). Test\nand control samples are treated with separate iTRAQ labels\npostdigestion and combined prior to MS analysis. When the\npeptide ions are fragmented with CID, the reporter ions are\ncleaved from the peptide and detected in the mass spectrom-\neter. The intensity of the reporter ions can then be quantified.\nQuantitation with iTRAQ, allows for the analysis up to eight\ndifferent treatment groups41 simultaneously. One of the dis-\nadvantages of performing CID in ion traps is the instability of\nions withm\/z values approximately 1\/3 that of the parent ion,42\nthat is, fragment ions with m\/z less than 1\/3 of the precursor\nions are not detected. iTRAQ reporter ions have m\/z 113-121\nand therefore ion trap CID of iTRAQ labeled peptides often\ndoes not result in quantification. The recent introduction of\npulsed-Q dissociation43 (PQD) has allowed for the analysis of\niTRAQ labeled samples in linear ion trap mass analysers. PQD\nexcites ions with a high amplitude Q value; Q is a resonance\nexcitation pulse. When the ions are excited, they collide with\nneutral gas molecules in a similar manner to CID. The\nactivation profile applied in PQD is different to that of CID\nmeaning that low mass ions are stable and can be detected.\nTo date, the proteomic profile of GCF during the active\ninduction and subsequent resolution of inflammation under\ncontrolled conditions using the 21 day experimental gingivitis\nmodel has not been described. Herein we describe the quan-\ntitative analysis of GCF, collected from volunteers undergoing\nexperimental gingivitis, by LC-MS\/MS using Fourier transform\nion cyclotron resonance44 (FT-ICR) MS and iTRAQ isobaric\nmass tags, to establish a profile of changes in proteins in\nhealthy young volunteers that may be used to compare to the\ninflammatory response in other subsets of the population, such\nas those predisposed to periodontitis.\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects and Collection. The experimental gingivitis model\npreviously described by Chapple et al.9 was used, and the study\nwas approved by the South Birmingham Local Research Ethical\nCommittee (LREC 2004\/074). Ten nonsmoking volunteers\n(mean age 21 years; range 19-28, 4 males and 6 females) who\nhad unremarkable medical histories, no periodontal problems\n(past or present), were not undergoing orthodontic or pros-\nthetic appliance therapy or taking medication that may have\naffected results were enrolled into the study, and informed\nconsent was obtained. A split mouth design was employed with\ntest sites being the maxillary left 4, 5, and 6 (first and second\nAcute Inflammation and Its Resolution research articles\nJournal of Proteome Research \u2022 Vol. 9, No. 9, 2010 4733\npremolars and first molar on the left-hand side of the upper\njaw) in right-handed individuals (n ) 9) and the equivalent\nteeth on the maxillary right side in left-handed individuals\n(n ) 1). Control sites were the corresponding teeth on the\ncontralateral side. Plaque accumulation was assessed using a\nmodified Quigley-Hein index45 (PI; scores 0-5) and the gingival\nindex (GI) of Lo\u00a8e46 (scores 0-3) was used to measure gingival\ninflammation. Bleeding was measured dichotomously as pres-\nence or absence following gentle probing and expressed as the\npercentage of sites that bled upon probing. All volunteers had\nno evidence of attachment loss (destruction or loss of the\nconnective tissues and bone holding the teeth within their\nsockets) when admitted to the study. A soft vinyl splint was\nconstructed to cover five teeth, with a 5 mm clearance at each\nfree surface from the marginal tissues. The splint was inserted\ngently over test teeth before brushing, to ensure against any\nmechanical or chemical cleaning. The test and control teeth\nwere given a thorough prophylaxis and oral hygiene was closely\nmonitored for 2 weeks prior to the study commencing to ensure\npristine gingival health at baseline (see Introduction and Figure\n1). GCF samples were collected from both test and control sites\non days 0 (baseline), 7, 14, and 21. On day 21, following plaque\naccumulation at test sites and after GCF sampling and record-\ning of clinical indices, volunteers were given a full mouth\nprophylaxis and recommenced brushing without using the\nsplint, in order to resolve the experimentally induced inflam-\nmation at test sites. Fourteen days later (day 35), the final set\nof GCF samples was collected and clinical indices recorded.\nGingival crevicular fluid was collected on Periopaper strips\n(Oraflow, Plainview, NY) over a period of 30 s as previously\ndescribed.9 GCF volume was measured using a precalibrated\nPeriotron 8000 (Oraflow, Plainview, NY),47 from the 3 test teeth\nand the 3 control teeth. The three test strips were then placed\ninto a cryotube (Appleton Woods, Birmingham, U.K.) contain-\ning ammonium bicarbonate (100 mM, 200 \u00b5L), sealed and\nimmediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, prior to storage at -80\n\u00b0C. This procedure was repeated for the 3 control strips, thereby\nproviding one pooled sample from test teeth and one pooled\nsample from control teeth for each volunteer. Periopaper strips,\nshowed a percentage recovery of 62 ( 5% from spiked plasma\n(1 \u00b5L) (data not shown) as analyzed by the number of proteins\nidentified.\nSample Preparation. Samples were defrosted on ice. From\neach sample within a time point and test or control site, 200\n\u00b5L of solution was removed and pooled to give rise to 10 \u00d7 1\nmL samples: 5 from test sites and 5 from control sites, covering\nall time points. The pooled samples were vacuum centrifuged\nand reduced to 200 \u00b5L. To each pooled sample dithiothreitol\n(Fisher Scientific, U.K.) (20 \u00b5L, 50 mM) was added and the\nsamples incubated at 60 \u00b0C for 40 min. The sample was\nreturned to room temperature before iodoacetamide (Fisher\nScientific, U.K.) (100 \u00b5L, 22 mM) was added and the samples\nincubated at room temperature for 25 min. To consume any\nremaining iodoacetamide, dithiothreitol (2.8 \u00b5L, 50 mM) was\nadded. The samples were digested overnight with trypsin Gold\n(500 ng, Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 \u00b0C.\nThe samples were vacuum centrifuged to dryness, resus-\npended in trifluoroacetic acid (Fisher Scientific, U.K.) (TFA,\n0.5%, 200 \u00b5L) and desalted using a Michrom desalting Mac-\nrotrap (Michrom, Auburn, CA). The trap was wetted using\nacetonitrile:water (50:50, 300 \u00b5L) and washed with TFA (0.1%,\n200 \u00b5L). The sample was loaded onto the trap and washed with\nTFA (0.1%, 200 \u00b5L) and eluted in acetonitrile\/water (70:30, 200\n\u00b5L). Samples were vacuum centrifuged to dryness. Samples\nwere resuspended in dissolution buffer (0.5 M triethylammo-\nnium bicarbonate, 30 \u00b5L). The two day 0 samples were\ncombined and half the sample was taken forward for labeling.\nThe day 7 control was omitted such that 8 samples were labeled\nin total, as follows. The iTRAQ 8-plex labels (Applied Biosys-\ntems, Foster City, CA) were resuspended in isopropanol (50 \u00b5L),\nadded to the 8 samples as below, vortexed for 1 min and\nincubated at room temperature for 2 h. The labels were applied\nin the following order (sampling time and condition, sample\nID): Day 0, 113; Day 7 test, 114; Day 14 control, 115; Day 14\ntest, 116; Day 21 control, 117; Day 21 test, 118; Day 35 control,\n119; and Day 35 test, 121.\nThe eight labeled samples were combined and vacuum\ncentrifuged dry. The pooled sample was desalted as above and\nresuspended in mobile phase A (see below, 200 \u00b5L). The sample\nwas separated using strong cation exchange high performance\nliquid chromatography (SCX-HPLC) and fractions collected.\nThe chromatography was performed on an Ettan LC (GE\nHealthcare Life Science, U.K.) with a Frac-950 fraction collec-\ntion system. The sample was separated on a polysulfethyl A\ncolumn (100 mm \u00d72.1 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size, 200 \u00c5pore size.\nPolyLC, Columbia, MD) with a javelin guard cartridge (10 mm\n\u00d7 2.1 mm, 5 \u00b5mparticle size, 200 \u00c5pore size. PolyLC, Columbia,\nMD). Mobile phase A was potassium dihydrogen orthophos-\nphate (10 mM, pH 3) dissolved in water:acetonitrile (80:20).\nMobile phase B was potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (10\nmM), potassium chloride (500 mM, pH 3) dissolved in water\/\nacetonitrile (80:20). The LC gradient ran from 0 to 80% mobile\nphase B over 73 min. Half of the sample was loaded onto the\ncolumn and eighteen fractions were collected in eppendorf\ntubes (1.5 mL). Fractions were combined to give a total of 8\nfractions (fractions 2, 18, and 19 were combined; 3, 16, and 17\ncombined; 4 and 15 combined; 5 and 14 combined; 6 and\n13 combined; 7 and 12 combined; 8 and 11 combined; 9 and\n10 combined). The combinations gave rise to a minimum\nnumber of fractions with similar peptide quantities. The eight\nFigure 1. Flowchart of study design for test sites.

The fractions were resuspended in formic acid (0.1%,\n50 \u00b5L). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate with 5 \u00b5L used\nfor mass spectrometric analysis.\nLiquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry\n(LC-MS\/MS). Online liquid chromatography was performed\nby use of a Micro AS autosampler and Surveyor MS pump\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Peptides were\nloaded onto a 75 \u00b5m (internal diameter) Integrafrit (New\nObjective, Woburn, MA) C8 resolving column (length 10 cm)\nand separated over a 40 min gradient from 0% to 40%\nacetonitrile (Baker, Holland). Peptides were eluted directly\n(\u223c350 nL\/min) via a Triversa nanospray source (Advion Bio-\nsciences, Ithaca, NY) into a 7 T LTQ FT mass spectrometer\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific), where they were subjected to data-\ndependent PQD.\nData-Dependent PQD. The mass spectrometer alternated\nbetween a full FT-MS scan (m\/z 400-2000) and subsequent\nPQD MS\/MS scans of the three most abundant ions above a\nthreshold of 1500. Survey scans were acquired in the ICR cell\nwith a resolution of 100 000 at m\/z 400. Precursor ions were\nsubjected to PQD in the linear ion trap. The width of the\nprecursor isolation window was 2 m\/z. Only multiply charged\nprecursor ions were selected for MS\/MS. PQD was performed\nwith helium gas at a normalized collision energy of 45%,\nactivation Q 0.8 and activation time 200 ms. Automated gain\ncontrol was used to accumulate sufficient precursor ions (target\nvalue 5 \u00d7 104, maximum fill time 0.2 s). Dynamic exclusion\nwas used with a repeat count of 1 and exclusion duration of\n180 s. Data acquisition was controlled by Xcalibur software\nV2.1.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).\nData Analysis. The MS\/MS spectra were searched against a\nconcatentated forward and reverse IPI human database v3.66\nsupplemented with bacterial proteins (224 902 entries) using\nthe SEQUEST algorithm in Proteome Discoverer sp 1.0 (Thermo\nFisher Scientific). Only the iTRAQ labels were specified as\nvariable modifications, with carboxyamidomethylation of cys-\nteine as a static modification. The data were searched with a\nprecursor mass error of 20 ppm and a fragment mass error of\n0.5 Da. The search results were filtered using XCorr vs charge\nstate (peptides reporting XCorr values <2 for 2+ ions, <2.25 for\n3+ ions and <2.5 for 4+ or greater ions are rejected) resulting\nin a false discovery rate of less than 1%. The database used\nwas compiled of human FASTA proteins from the IPI database\nsupplemented with bacterial families identified by Socransky48\nas being associated with periodontal health or periodontal\ndisease. These families were Porphyromonas, Bacterioides,\nTreponema, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Campylobacter, Eubac-\nterium, Streptococcus, Capnocytophaga, Eikenella, Actinobac-\ncillus, Actinomyces, Selenomonas and Aggregaterbacter.\nStatistical Analysis. Protein database searches resulted in\n10 000 protein hits across all the runs. These were filtered for\nproteins identified in at least three fractions by at least 2\npeptides and quantified at all time points. The temporal\nquantitative profiles of these proteins were analyzed using\nPolySNAP3 software.49 PolySNAP3 compares trends using a\nweighted mean of the Pearson parametric and Spearman\nnonparametric correlation coefficients employing every mea-\nsured intensity data point common to all one-dimensional\npatterns. Cluster numbers are estimated by: principal compo-\nnents analysis using transformed and nontransformedmatrices;\nmultidimensional metric scaling (MMDS); gamma statistic,\nCalinski-Harabasz statistic and C-statistic using either single\nlinkage, group averages, Ward method or complete linkage. The\nmaximum number of clusters was selected as generated by\nthese methods. Data were visualized by 3-dimensional MMDS\nplots and dendrograms.\nResults\nClinical measurements revealed that the volunteers had\ncomplied with the study criteria as shown in Figure 2, where it\ncan be seen that plaque accumulated significantly at the test\nsites but not the control sites, as assessed by the plaque index.\nAfter removal of all plaque from both test and control sites at\nday 21 microbial recolonization to baseline levels was observed\nat day 35. Clinical measurements also demonstrated that at test\nsites inflammation had been induced, as measured by the\nmodified gingival index (Figure 3) and the bleeding index\n(Figure 4). Both these indices showed significant increases at\ntest sites but not at control sites during plaque accumulation\nand returned to baseline levels, at day 35, after removal of the\ninflammatory stimulus at day 21 and resumption of manual\nbrushing (Figure 1). Similarly, GCF volume increased with\nplaque accumulation at test sites but not at control sites and\nreturned to baseline levels after removal of the inflammatory\nstimulus (Figure 5).\nUsing a meta-proteomics approach, 16 bacterial and 186\nhuman proteins were identified (Tables 1 and 2). The bacterial\nproteins showed little temporal variance across the course of\nthe experimental gingivitis, from day 0 to day 35.\nFigure 2. Plaque accumulation was assessed using a modified\nQuigley-Hein index (PI). Data were analyzed by a Kruskal-Wallis\ntest with a Dunn\u2019s post test. *** represents p < 0.001 and **\nrepresents p < 0.01 in comparison to day 0; $ represents p < 0.05\nin comparison to control site at the same time point.\nFigure 3.

These 16 proteins were then removed from subsequent\nstatistical analysis. The proteins in cluster 1 were then used to\nfilter the data from the test sites, which were normalized to\ncontrol sites. The normalized data for the 170 proteins were\nanalyzed using PolySNAP3 to identify the proteins whose\nabundances showed the greatest change with development of\nexperimental gingivitis. Five clusters were determined (Clusters\nA-E, maximum number of clusters: 6, range 2-6, median\nnumber of clusters 3, Figure 7). Clusters A and E, containing 3\nproteins each, increased to a maximum value at day 14 and\nday 21 respectively before returning to baseline levels at day\n35. Clusters C (1 protein) and D (2 proteins), both decreased\nat day 14 and then either returned to baseline at days 21 and\n35 (Cluster C) or returned to baseline at day 21 and continued\nto increased to a maximum value at day 35. Cluster B, (161\nproteins), appeared to remain constant at baseline levels and\nthroughout the course of the experimental gingivitis.\nInspection of the dendrogram from this clustering analysis\ndemonstrated that there were still many clusters within group\nB. Thus further analysis of this group was performed. The\nsecond round of clustering revealed a further 6 clusters (clusters\nB1-6, maximum number of clusters: 6, range 3-6, median\nnumber of clusters 4, Figure 7). Clusters B4 (4 proteins) and\nB5 (2 proteins) demonstrated increases across the course of\nthe experimental gingivitis peaking at days 14 and 21 respec-\ntively and remaining elevated at the peak level at day 35.\nClusters B1, B3 and B6, containing 8, 20, and 4 proteins\nrespectively, decreased during the course of the study. Cluster\nB1 showed a small decrease at day 14 and then returned to\nbaseline levels before decreasing greatly at day 35. Cluster B3\ndecreased at day 14 but returned to baseline at subsequent time\npoints. Cluster B6 decreased at day 14 and remained at this\nlevel for the rest of the experimental gingivitis. Cluster B2 (123\nproteins) did not fluctuate at this level of detail across the\ncourse of the experimental gingivitis and these proteins were\nagain taken for further clustering analysis. That analysis gave\nrise to another 6 clusters (clusters B2i-vi, maximum number\nof clusters: 6, range 3-6, median number of clusters 4, Figure\n7). At this point two observations were made: (1) the largest\ngroup (B2i) showed a slight increase at day 21, i.e., no longer\nshowed little variation across the course of the experimental\ngingivitis and (2) the variation in the ratio to day 0 for all the\nclusters was now between 0-1 unit at its maximum. Therefore,\nfurther rounds of clustering analysis were not pursued, even\nthough there were still a large number of proteins in the largest\ncluster (cluster B2i, n ) 86). Inspection of the patterns\ngenerated from this third and final clustering showed that\ncluster B2ii (1 protein) showed a peak at day 21; cluster B2iii\n(4 proteins) peaked at day 14 and then decreased at days 21\nand 35; cluster B2iv (13 proteins) showed little change over\n14 and 21 days but an increase at day 35; cluster B2v (1\nprotein) showed a decrease at day 21; and cluster B2vi (18\nproteins) showed an increase at day 14 that was sustained\nto day 21 before returning to baseline at day 35. Fold changes\nfor all proteins in Cluster 1 can be found in the supplemental\nTable 1.\nGene ontology analysis for location revealed the majority of\nproteins identified to cover the entire range of nuclear, plasma\nmembrane, cytoplasmic and extracellular compartments (Fig-\nure 8). Gene ontology analysis for function identified a wide\nrange of possibilities with the greatest numbers of proteins for\ncellular transcription, DNA binding, cytoskeletal functions, cell\nadhesion, defense against bacteria and cilia (Figure 8). Par-\nticular clusters did not preferentially fall into one of these\ncategories and the proteins functions were diverse throughout\nthe individual clusters. It should be noted that between 35 and\n40% proteins did not have gene ontology terms that could be\nused.\nDiscussion\nAcross the course of experimentally induced gingivitis, we\nidentified 16 bacterial and 186 human proteins by combining\niTRAQ and LC-MS\/MS on an FT-ICR mass spectrometer. The\nabundances of the bacterial proteins identified did not vary\ntemporally. This observation may be used as confirmation that\nthe GCF samples were not significantly contaminated with\nplaque during sampling. Furthermore, Fusobacterium species\n(Fusobacterium outer membrane proteins) were detected and\nFigure 4. Bleeding on probing was measured dichotomously as\npresence or absence following gentle probing and expressed as\npercentage of sites that bled upon probing. Data were analyzed\nby a Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn\u2019s post test. *** represents\np < 0.001 and * represents p < 0.05 in comparison to day 0; $\nrepresents p < 0.05 in comparison to control site at the same\ntime point.\nFigure 5.

As GCF comprises both a serum\ntransudate and tissue exudates, it is unsurprising to find both\nextracellular and intracellular components within samples.\nWith respect to the extracellular components, serum proteins,\nsuch as albumin, IgG3 and apolipoprotein B-100; as well as\nproteins displaying antibacterial properties, such as neutrophil\ndefensin, cystatins B and S and Annexins A1 and A3, were\nfound. The serum components (albumin and IgG3) clustered\ntogether (cluster B3) and showed a decrease at day 14 at test\nsites. At this time point, the GCF volume from test sites was\nalready significantly increased above control sites. On the other\nhand apolipoprotein B-100 falls into cluster B2vi, which follows\nthe profile of the increase in GCF volume and bleeding index\nat test sites. Apolipoprotein B-100 is the protein component\nof low density lipoprotein, which has a diameter of ap-\nproximately 26 nm. This particle is unlikely to be able to pass\nacross the permeable sulcular membrane and could potentially\nbe used as a marker of increased microulceration of the sulcular\nepithelium. Cystatins B and S and Annexins A1 and A3 were\nfound in cluster B2i, which was largely unchanged across the\ncourse of the experimental gingivitis. Cystatin B and Annexin\nA1 were found by Bostanci et al.29 only in healthy volunteers\nand not in developing inflammatory disease. That they seem\nnot to change across the course of our experiment would\nsupport the idea that they are not associated with the develop-\nment of moderate gingival inflammation. Neutophil defensin\nwas found in cluster B2iv that showed the greatest increases\nat day 35 for the test sites. This may indicate a role in\nmaintaining a healthy state upon resolution of inflammation.\nBostanci et al.29 also detected this protein at healthy sites,\nalthough the GCF volume at these sites is equivalent to day 7\nin this experimental gingivitis study, perhaps highlighting a\npotential role of neutrophil defensin in population based health\nscreening.\nIntracellular proteins identified had functions such as cellular\ntranscription, DNA binding, cytoskeletal functions, cell adhe-\nsion, and cilia proteins. Starting with cytoskeletal proteins, a\nlarge number of keratins were identified, which was expected\nfrom sampling adjacent to epithelial tissues. The oral epithe-\nlium has one of the highest turnover rates50 and this will have\ncontributed to the large number of keratins seen. The majority\nof keratins were clustered together in cluster B2i, which showed\nthe least variation across the course of the experimental\ngingivitis, perhaps indicating that the differentiation or prolif-\neration of the epithelium was not affected during the course\nof the induced inflammation, again consistent with a sulcular\nrather than a pocket lining epithelium that characterizes\nperiodontitis. However, it is acknowledged that some keratin\ncontamination could have occurred during sample handling.\nOther cytoskeletal and associated proteins, such as titin and\nactin- and microtubule- associated proteins, also fell into\ncluster B2i. These proteins could be components of desqua-\nmated epithelial cells released during the turnover of the\nepithelium. There were also several axonemal dynein proteins\ngrouped to cluster B2i. To our knowledge, these cilia-associated\nproteins have not been identified in GCF before. However, a\nnumber of studies51-53 have used histology to investigate\nchanges in the gingivae in periodontal disease. Saglie et al.53\nused scanning electron microscopy to investigate the pocket\nepithelium from patients with advanced periodontal disease.\nAt high resolution they observed individual epithelial cells,\nTable 1.

These proteins are associated\nwith chromatin and may indicate the presence of neutrophil\nextracellular traps (NETs).56 In addition to phagocytosis, neu-\ntrophils can discharge decondensed chromatin and associated\nproteins to trap and immobilize bacteria. These NETs have\nbeen shown to be present in the gingival crevice of periodontitis\npatients.57 Neutrophils are the most important leukocytes in\nthe periodontal tissues and have been implicated in periodon-\ntitis patients as being hyper-active and hyper-reactive.58,59\nFurther evidence for neutrophils may be taken from the\npresence of Plastin-2 (or L-plastin), which was also identified\nby Bostanci et al.29 Plastin-2 is an actin bundling protein that\nplays a role in signaling following Fc\u03b3 receptor stimulation in\nadherent neutrophils. Here we found Plastin-2 clusters within\ncluster B3, which demonstrated a decrease at day 14 at test\nsites, which might indicate a less adherent phenotype in\nneutrophils at this stage of the inflammatory response. Bostanci\net al.29 reported this protein in aggressive periodontitis patients\nonly, perhaps showing a further change in the behavior of\nneutrophils in diseased rather than healthy volunteers.\nIn this study, we have used PolySNAP3 clustering software\nin a multilayered analytical approach. For ease of comprehen-\nsion, an analogy may be used of examining the clusters of\nproteins in a manner similar to \u201cpeeling away the layers of an\nonion\u201d or \u201czooming in to different levels of detail in the\nclustering\u201d. The first layer isolated those proteins that did not\nmaintain a broadly steady flat baseline in the control sites\nduring the course of the experimental gingivitis. The greatest\nchange was seen with Nebulin (cluster 5); however, other\nisoforms of this protein (nebulin isoform 1 and 2) were\nclustered to cluster B2i which showed the least variation across\nthe course of the experimental gingivitis. Other proteins in\nclusters 2-4 showed decreases from baseline. Cluster analysis\nof the entire data set (not shown) always showed these\nparticular proteins as lying outside the central core (Figure 6\ncontrol cluster 3D MMDS plot), thus they may be viewed as\noutliers. Following the exclusion of these proteins the normal-\nized test data was clustered revealing the clusters that changed\nthe most across the course of the experimental gingivitis and\nthen subsequent clustering of the largest group showed the next\nlevel of changes, and so on in the third round of clustering.\nTwo groups (clusters A and E) in the first round of clustering\nand one (cluster B2vi) in the third round of clustering showed\nincreases at days 14, 21, and 14 respectively, which were similar\nto increases in the clinical parameters. Cluster A contained\ndisparate proteins involved in neuronal axons, transcription\nand protein production; cluster E contained proteins involved\nin signal transduction, actin-myosin based movement and\nsynaptic transmission; and cluster B2vi contained many pro-\nteins including actin-myosin based movement and synaptic\ntransmission again. A common theme from these clusters might\nbe the presence of neuronal and synapse associated proteins.\nThe most abundant is protein bassoon which is a constituent\nof ribbon synapses. Sterling and Matthews (2005)60 suggest that\nribbon synapses \u201coccur wherever synaptic exocytosis is evoked\nby graded depolarisation and where signalling requires a high\nrate of sustained release\u201d such as in the terminals of photo-\nreceptors and auditory and vestibular hair cells. These synapses\nuse glutamate as their primary neurotransmitter and this would\nfit with the identification of metabotropic glutamate receptors\nin cluster B2vi. Histological investigations of gingival biopsies\nwill be required to verify the presence of ribbon synapses within\nthe gingivae as their presence has not been seen before. The\nrole of their destruction during experimental gingivitis remains\nto be fully investigated, particularly with the knowledge that\nsubstance P, a neuropeptide, released from sensory neurones\nand an inducer of inflammation and pain, is increased in\nFigure 6. Cluster analysis of data set showing the workflow and clusters generated. Control sites across the course of the experimental\ngingivitis study were clustered using PolySNAP3. Group 1 showed no changes from baseline, whereas groups 2-5 differed from\nbaseline over the course of the experiment (Control clusters). Below the flow diagram are graphs representing the mean ((sem) changes\nof the proteins in each cluster, which are followed beneath by 3-dimensional metric multidimensional scaling (MMDS) plots and\ndendrograms showing the relationships of individual proteins with others in the analysis group.

Cluster analysis of data set showing the workflow and clusters generated. Proteins identified from group 1 were used for the next\nstep of the analysis using normalized test data which were clustered using PolySNAP3. Five clusters (clusters A-E) were generated (cluster\nround 1 summary), with 161 proteins identified in cluster B. The proteins in cluster B were then further analyzed by PolySNAP3 to generate\n6 clusters (clusters B1-6; cluster round 2 summary). The largest group from this analysis was group B2 (123 proteins). This group was then\nfurther analyzed using PolySNAP3 to generate 6 clusters (clusters B2i-vi, cluster round 3 summary).

However, in this study\nwe have not been able to detect any cytokines, consistent with\nBostanci et al.29 This is probably due to the cytokines being at\nlow, subattomol, concentrations.\nTo conclude, here we have shown for the first time the\nquantitative analysis of temporal changes of proteins in gingival\ncrevicular fluid, using a nonpresumptive approach. Proteins\nidentified included proteins already known to the dental\ncommunity and verification of newly identified proteins in\nother mass spectral studies. We have also identified new\nproteins that highlight structural components of the gingivae\nthat have not been seen before and that warrant further\ninvestigation.\nAcknowledgment.
