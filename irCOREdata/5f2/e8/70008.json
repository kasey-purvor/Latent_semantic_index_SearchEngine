Most of his research has been on the \nsociotechnical organisation of the clinical neurosciences, and he has published \nhistorical and ethnographic papers on neurosurgery.

He is presently working on the concept of \u2018bio-power\u2019, \nfocussing especially on the writings of Giorgio Agamben and Paul Rabinow.\nAbstract \nIn this paper, we argue that contemporary biomedicine is shaped by two, seemingly \nincommensurable, organisational logics, the \u2018regime of truth\u2019 and the \u2018regime of \nhope\u2019. We articulate their features by drawing on debates sparked by the recent \nclinical trial of a new approach to the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s Disease. We also \nargue that the \u2018self\u2019 is configured in the very same process whereby these two \norganisational logics interlock and become mutually dependent, so that the \u2018self\u2019 \nmight be said to be the effect of a \u2018parasitic\u2019 relationship between the regimes of \n\u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019. We then bring these two arguments to bear on the contrasting \nviews of the relationship between embodiment and political subjectivity articulated \nby Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben, on the one hand, and Paul Rabinow and \nNikolas Rose, on the other hand. \n \nKeywords \nNeurosciences; stem cells; self; subjectivity; biopolitics.\n  \n14 October 2008: 1 \nBETWEEN TRUTH AND HOPE: ON PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE, \nNEUROTRANSPLANTATION AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE \u2018SELF\u2019 \n \nWho is Alfred? \nWe would like to open a series of critical reflections on the contemporary, biomedical \nproduction of the \u2018self\u2019 with the following excerpt from Jonathan Franzen\u2019s novel The \nCorrections: \n \nAlfred was standing in the master bedroom wondering why the drawers of his dresser \nwere open, who had opened them, whether he had opened them himself. He couldn\u2019t help \nblaming Enid for his confusion. For witnessing it into existence. For existing, herself, as a \nperson who could have opened these drawers.  \n \n\u2018Al? What are you doing?\u2019  \n \nHe turned to the doorway where she\u2019d appeared. He began a sentence: \u2018I am \u2026\u2019 but when \nhe was taken by surprise, every sentence became an adventure in the woods; as soon as \nhe could no longer see the light of the clearing from which he\u2019d entered, he would realize \nthat the crumbs he\u2019d dropped for bearings had been eaten by birds, silent deft darting \nthings which he couldn\u2019t quite see in the darkness but which were so numerous and \nswarming in their hunger that it seemed as if they were the darkness, as if the darkness \nweren\u2019t uniform, weren\u2019t an absence of light but a teeming and corpuscular thing, and \nindeed when as a studious teenager he\u2019d encountered the word \u2018crepuscular\u2019 in McKay\u2019s \nTreasury of English Verse, the corpuscles of biology had bled into his understanding of \nthe word, so that for his entire adult life he\u2019d seen in twilight a corpuscularity, as of the \ngraininess of the high-speed film necessary for photography under conditions of low \nambient light, as of a kind of sinister decay; and hence the panic of a man betrayed deep \nin the woods whose darkness was the darkness of starlings blotting out the sunset or \nblack ants storming a dead opossum, a darkness that didn\u2019t just exist but actively \nconsumed the bearings that he\u2019d sensibly established for himself, lest he be lost; but in \nthe instant of realizing he was lost, time became marvellously slow and he discovered \nhitherto unguessed eternities in the space between one word and the next, or rather he \nbecame trapped in that space between words and could only stand and watch as time \nsped on without him, the thoughtless boyish part of him crashing on out of sight blindly \nthrough the woods while he, trapped, the grownup Al, watched in oddly impersonal \nsuspense to see if the panic-stricken little boy might, despite no longer knowing where he \n  \n14 October 2008: 2 \nwas or at what point he\u2019d entered the woods of this sentence, still manage to blunder into \nthe clearing where Enid was waiting for him, unaware of any woods - \u2018packing my \nsuitcase,\u2019 he heard himself say. This sounded right. Verb, possessive, noun. Here was a \nsuitcase in front of him, an important confirmation. He\u2019d betrayed nothing.  \n \nBut Enid had spoken again. The audiologist had said that he was mildly impaired. He \nfrowned at her, not following. \n \n\u2018It\u2019s Thursday,\u2019 she said, louder. \u2018We\u2019re not leaving until Saturday.\u2019  \n \n\u2018Saturday!\u2019 he echoed.  \n \nShe berated him then, and for a while the crepuscular birds retreated, but outside the \nwind had blown the sun out, and it was getting very cold (Franzen, 2001: 12-13). \n \nThe Corrections tells the story of the fictional Lambert family from the different \nperspectives of its five members. Alfred is suffering from Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) \nand is progressively slipping toward dementia and death; Enid is Alfred\u2019s stubborn \nand ever hopeful wife; Gary is the pragmatic, eldest son, who is told by his own wife \nto seek professional advice for his \u2018depression\u2019, if he wishes to keep his marriage \nintact; Chip is the youngest son who was fired from his post of professor in cultural \ntheory, for sexual harassment; and Denise is the emotionally confused daughter and \nchef. Alfred\u2019s rapidly deteriorating condition is the point of contention that brings \nthis seemingly dysfunctional family together. According to Gary and Enid, Alfred \nshould be convinced that, at the very least, the Axon Corporation, which has \nexploited Alfred\u2019s invention of a semi-conducting material to develop a new \ntreatment for PD, owes him inclusion in its experimental trials of this new treatment. \nDenise, however, fears that she will be forced to house her parents, if Alfred is to be \nable to participate in the trials. Finally, Chip believes that Alfred should be left alone, \nto deal with his mortality in his own way. As these four negotiate between \nthemselves, Alfred, the once youthful reader of Arthur Schopenhauer, who, like the \n  \n14 October 2008: 3 \nGerman philosopher, has always believed in the meaninglessness of the world, \nbecomes progressively detached from all these positions. For the reader, as for the \nfour other members of the Lambert family, Alfred\u2019s disengagement is both \nfrustrating and puzzling: Why is Alfred not interested in getting better? Why will he \nnot at least admit to the hopelessness of his situation?  \n \nIn this paper, we try to articulate a possible answer to the puzzle that Alfred poses. \nRecognising that, in The Corrections, PD figures both as a substantive topic and a \nmetaphorical device, our thesis is that the increasingly familiar predicament in which \nall five members of the Lambert family find themselves captures a wider tension \nstructuring knowledge and experience of the \u2018self\u2019 within the domain of \ncontemporary biomedicine. We argue firstly that biomedicine is shaped by two \nconflicting organisational logics, which, in many ways, evoke the divisions within the \nLambert family. These two organisational logics are the \u2018regime of truth\u2019 and the \n\u2018regime of hope\u2019. While undoubtedly courting confusion with the medical \u2018regimen\u2019, \nwe none the less wish to label these organisational logics as \u2018regimes\u2019 to thus \nemphasise not just the public articulation of particular political subjectivities, usually \nassociated with the word \u2018discourse\u2019, but also their embedding in usually far less \nvisible social networks and material practices (see Foucault, 1991; Thev\u00e9not, 2001). \nWe will attend to these two organisational logics by drawing on the debates recently \nsparked by the clinical trial of a new approach to the treatment of PD, examining in \nconsiderable detail conflicting opinions about the viability, desirability and outcome \nof the trial. Importantly, we do not wish to imply that the organisational logics and \nconflicts to which we attend are in any way novel to the domain of biomedicine (see, \nfor example, Marks, 1992; 2000). We do wish to note, however, that clinical trials no \nlonger are a vehicle for an impossible escape from politics, but have instead become \n  \n14 October 2008: 4 \nthe medium of political engagement within the biomedical domain (Epstein, 1996; \nsee also Dehue, 2002). Having established this opposition, we argue secondly that a \nparticular configuration of the \u2018self\u2019 is constituted in the very same historical process \nwhereby the two, largely autonomous, organisational logics eventually interlock and \nbecome mutually dependent. In other words, we address the way in which a \nparticular configuration of the \u2018self\u2019 might be said to be the historical effect of an \nincreasingly \u2018parasitic\u2019 relationship between the regimes of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019 (see \nSerres, 1982; Brown S., 2002). We will conclude by drawing on this particular \nunderstanding of the relationship between \u2018truth\u2019, \u2018hope\u2019 and the \u2018self\u2019 to answer the \nquestions that Alfred\u2019s disengagement poses for both his fictional family and that \nreader of The Corrections who is mindful of all their contemporary resonance. \n \nPutting neurotransplantation to the test \nOn the 15 March 2001, few readers of the Guardian, a leading British daily \nnewspaper, could have failed to take note of following headline and picture (see also \nDumit, 2004). \n \nFigure 1: Guardian, 15 March 2001. \n  \n14 October 2008: 5 \n \nSophie Petit-Zeman, one of the Guardian\u2019s writers, fleshed out the dramatic headline \nby writing that: \n \nEarlier this week it was announced that a trial of a new treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease \nhad, for some patients, gone horribly wrong. A group of volunteers in the US had foetal \ncells transplanted directly into their brains, in the hope that they would survive and \nproduce dopamine, the \u2018chemical messenger\u2019 missing in patients suffering from \nParkinson\u2019s. But the researchers were horrified to discover that instead of being helped by \nthe experiment, a small number of the patients got much worse. The cells appear to have \ngone into overdrive, producing too much dopamine and causing the patients to writhe \nand jerk their heads uncontrollably. Unlike many experimental procedures, scientists \nhave no way of reversing this particular treatment. The experiment has been stopped \ncompletely, prompting despair in many sufferers who hoped it offered a possibility for a \ncure (Petit-Zeman, 2001; emphasis added).  \n \nWhile, for most readers, this would have been their first encounter with the field of \nneurotransplantation and the therapeutic, intracerebral implantation of embryonic \nneuronal material, for those involved with PD, either through their research, their \ninvestment, their care of others or their personal experience, this was very important \nnews. The Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society, the leading British charity in the field, for \nexample, was quick to position itself by announcing that \u2018despite setbacks in recent \nsurgical trials\u2019, the intracerebral implantation of embryonic neuronal tissue provides \n\u2018early evidence and real hope of a breakthrough\u2019 in the treatment of PD (Parkinson\u2019s \nDisease Society, 2004). Martin Edwards, the chief executive of ReNeuron PLC, a \ncompany specialising in the development of biological products for the treatment of \nneurological disorders, was of the same opinion. Even Sir Iain Chalmers, \u2018director of \n\u2026 an international organisation that collects evidence on experimental treatments, \nand a leading expert on clinical trials\u2019 is reported to have acknowledged the ethical \nproblems raised by human experimentation, but to have none the less maintained \n  \n14 October 2008: 6 \n\u2018that he would have participated in the trial himself. In the sense that any results, \neven negative ones, are invaluable, he persists in viewing this experiment as \u2018a \ntremendous success\u201d (Petit-Zeman, 2001). Such \u2018negative\u2019 results, however, did not \nconstitute a positive outcome for all parties involved. Thus, another report on the \ntrial, this time in the New York Times, suggested that professional opinion was far \nmore divided than the Guardian\u2019s opposition of public and professional responses \nwould suggest. In this report, some researchers appeared to call for the halting of all \ntransplants of embryonic neuronal tissue and the focussing of research on more \nreliable sources of implants, such as stem cells, the undifferentiated, pluripotent cells \nthat constitute the early embryo. Others appeared instead to question the legitimacy \nof the entire enterprise, because, either way, it involved the exploitation of human \nembryonic material (see Kolata, 2001). While it is tempting to attribute this more \nstrictly professional disagreement to a peculiarly American debate over the legal \nframework for research on stems cells and associated technologies, such an \ninterpretation oversimplifies the positions taken, because a number of other actors, \nremoved from this peculiarly American context, also felt that the outcome of the trial \ncalled the future of stem cell technology into question. We suggest that, to \nunderstand the linking of the trial and the future of stem cell technology, we must \nfirst understand the conditions under which the trial was conceived and conducted.  \n \nWhile the use of L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) as a pharmaceutical \ntreatment for PD gained increasing support from the mid-1960s onward and has \ntoday become a stable component of the therapeutic repertoire, the understanding of \nunderlying mechanisms still is a matter of debate (Hornykiewicz, 2002). Moreover, it \nis widely agreed that the use of L-DOPA does not in fact provide a satisfactory \ntreatment of PD. As much as L-DOPA might increase the neuronal synthesis of \n  \n14 October 2008: 7 \ndopamine in those parts of a particular region of the brain, the substantia nigra, that \nhave not yet degenerated, it neither slows down nor arrests the more general process \nof neuronal decay.  \n \n \nFigure 2: The brain \n \nOver the same forty years, some researchers have argued that the transplantation of \nneuronal tissue and consequent modification of neurophysiological function in \nlaboratory animals suggests that implanted neurons can bypass degenerating ones \nand re-establish physiological transmission between the substantia nigra and the \nstriatum regions of the brain. As such, they have also argued that \nneurotransplantation might offer a more effective approach to the treatment of PD \nthan the use of L-DOPA (see Breeze & Wang, 1999). Since the late 1980s, there have \ntherefore been numerous \u2018open\u2019 clinical trials of the intracerebal transplantation of \nembryonic neuronal tissue. These were trials involving the statistical comparison of \npre- and post-operative clinical condition of patients who had volunteered to have \nembryonic neuronal tissue implanted in their brain. Although most of these trials \nsuggested that neurotransplantation offered a viable approach to the treatment of \n  \n14 October 2008: 8 \nPD, it remained controversial, largely for the following two reasons. The first was \nthat there were strong objections to its dependence of implants collected from \naborted foetuses, not only due to moral objections to abortion, but also due to \nconcern about the possible abusive exploitation of the human body (see Boer, 1996). \nThe second reason was that, from the perspective of health care buyers and \nproviders, in the context of an increasingly managerial approach to health care, \nneurotransplantation was not only a dangerous procedure, but also one that was \nexpensive and difficult to standardise (Blue Cross\/Blue Shield Technology \nEvaluation Center, 2001).  \n \nIn 1994, as a consequence of the above concerns, the United States National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH) took an initiative that is characteristic of post-war health \ncare politics (Marks, 1997; Timmermans & Berg, 2003). The NIH attempted to settle \nthe debate over the value of neurotransplantation for PD by sponsoring a trial that \ncould be seen as methodologically sound by both the supporters and opponents of \nthe procedure. More specifically, it decided to sponsor a \u2018double-blind, placebo \ncontrolled\u2019 trial of the intracerebral implantation of embryonic neuronal cells in 40 \npatients that were afflicted by PD. As Curt Freed, the neurosurgeon at the University \nof Colorado who was charged with the responsibility of conducting the trial, \nrecollects in the final report on the trial, \u2018transplantation of embryonic dopamine \nneurons into the brain of patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease has proved beneficial in \nopen clinical trials \u2026 [but] \u2026 whether this intervention would be more effective than \nsham surgery in a controlled trial \u2026 [was] \u2026 not known\u2019 (Freed, 2001: 710). The \npatients were therefore divided into two groups, one in which cultured cerebral \ntissue from four human embryos was implanted bilaterally, along 30 to 40 mm \nneedle tracts in the putamen region of the brain, and one which underwent \u2018sham \n  \n14 October 2008: 9 \nsurgery\u2019, in this case, the boring of cranial holes without any placement of the \nembryonic cells. The primary evaluation did not show any significant differences \nbetween the treatment and control groups: The recipients of the implants showed \nbetter outcomes in the \u2018objective measurements of PD\u2019, but some of the recipients \neventually developed dyskinesias, that is, abnormal and uncontrolled movements, \ntypically one year after surgery (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and \nStroke, 2000). As noted by Sophie Petit-Zeman, these dyskinesias were attributed to \nthe uncontrolled growth of the implanted neuronal tissue. This said, by 2000, the \nBlue Cross\/Blue Shield Technology Evaluation Center was anxious to advise health \ncare buyers on the relative merits of pharmacological and surgical approaches to PD, \npresumably because the latter was increasingly being offered to those affected by PD \nand Blue Cross\/Blue Shield was being asked to cover its considerable cost, US$ 40 \n000 (see Kolata, 2001). While the Blue Cross\/Blue Shield Technology Evaluation \nCenter expressed therefore some interest in the impending, final report on the trial, \nit undertook its own statistical review of earlier \u2018open\u2019 clinical trials and concluded \nthat the surgical approach did not in fact provide a viable alternative to \npharmacological treatment (Blue Cross\/Blue Shield Technology Evaluation Center, \n2001; see also Polgar, 2003). In other words, it seemed to the Blue Cross\/Blue Shield \nTechnology Evaluation Center that the NIH trial could not add very much to the \npicture generated by its statistical review, and, when the final results of the trial were \neventually released, what it added was not the greater clarity to which the NIH had \naspired, but still more doubt about the effectiveness of the surgical approach to PD.  \n \nImportantly, the NIH trial was not problematic simply because its results did not in \nfact settle the questions about the effectiveness of the surgical approach to PD, but \nbecause the methodological design of clinical trials was also called into question. As \n  \n14 October 2008: 10 \nRoger Albin, a neurologist at the University of Michigan, noted, \u2018the recent use of \nsham surgery in trial evaluating efficacy of intracerebral fetal tissue graft in \nParkinson\u2019s Disease has highlighted the ethical concerns associated with sham \nsurgery \u2026 [but] \u2026 appropriate clinical trial design, sometimes including sham \nsurgery, is needed to ensure that false positive trial results do not occur and \nendanger public safety\u2019 (Albin, 2002: 322). Albin was seeking to thus respond to \nthose observers who, after the release of the trial\u2019s results, raised questions about the \nethics of \u2018human experimentation\u2019, and, at the very least, called for both the \nabandonment of randomised controlled trials and a return to comparisons of pre- \nand post-operative conditions (see Dekkers & Boer, 2001). Such questioning, \nhowever, was not the exclusive prerogative of those who had always found the \nsurgical approach to PD less than convincing. It also involved those who, while \naccepting that results of the trial were disappointing, were nevertheless still \nconvinced of the value of neurotransplantation as a treatment for PD. Thus, for the \nNetwork of European Central Nervous System Transplantation and Restoration \n(NECTAR), a powerful professional association in this domain, the severest criticism \nwas that the trial always was likely to be unproductive and inconclusive because \nthose conducting it were so convinced of the merits of their approach that, just one \nyear into the trial, they offered the treatment to many patients in the control group \n(see Nikkah, 2001). The underlying commitments of this alternative position are \nperhaps best expressed by Eugene Redmond, a neurosurgeon at Yale University, who \nadmitted quite candidly that \u2018the outcome of the first randomised, double blind, \ncontrolled study challenged the idea that dopamine replacement cells can cure \nParkinson\u2019s Disease\u2019, but then asked \u2018were the earlier animal studies and clinical \nreports wrong? Should we give up on the goal?\u2019 and answered his seemingly critical \nquestions with a resounding \u2018no\u2019 (Redmond, 2002: 457; see also Storch & Schwartz, \n  \n14 October 2008: 11 \n2002). Pierre Cesaro, a key member of NECTAR, argued even more explicitly that \nthe neurosurgical approach to the treatment of PD \u2018deserves new clinical trials\u2019 \n(Cesaro, 2002: 143; emphasis added).  \n \nIn sum, while the NIH trial aimed to close the controversy over \nneurotransplantation, it in fact ended up re-initiating and re-articulating a debate \nthat has structured the field for over two decades, between those who support the \napproach and those who object to its rationale, methodology and ethics. While the \nlatter insist on the absence of any evidence for effectiveness of neurotransplantation \nand question its procedures, the former view these objections as exactly the reason to \ncontinue developing both the approach and the methodological robustness of its \ntrials. What is especially interesting about the debate over the NIH trial, however, is \nhow the two groups have harnessed the results of the trial to either promote or deter \nresearch on the therapeutic uses of stem cells. In this second debate, we can observe \nboth how proposed therapeutic uses of stem cells articulate a particular configuration \nof the \u2018self\u2019, and how this configuration brings into view a key absence in all \ndiscussions about the nature and consequences of PD.  \n  \nNeurotransplantation, stem cells and \u2018self-repair\u2019 \nAfter the publication of the results of NIH trial, in early 2001, positions and \ndiscussions over its likely impact on the future development of stem cell technology \nrippled through various arenas. Martin Edwards, the chief executive of ReNeuron \nPLC, for example, attributed the dyskinesias observed in the trial to the uncontrolled \ngrowth of the implanted neuronal tissue, suggesting that, rather than relying on \nheterogeneous embryonic material, more should be done to investigate new ways of \n  \n14 October 2008: 12 \nproducing \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 neuronal implants in the laboratory, from stem cells (see \nBoseley, 2001) . The same line of argument is evident in a running news stream in \nNature, one of the leading scientific journals in the world, in which it was suggested \nthat \u2018work with neurons grown from stem cells could offer clues \u2026 [for the \nimprovement of the neurosurgical treatment of PD] \u2026 because such lab-derived cells \nwould contain fewer impurities than fetal tissue\u2019 (Check, 2003; emphasis added. See \nalso Meek, 2001). The uncertainty about the possible outcome of this endeavour, \nwhich is embedded in the last statement, contrasts sharply with the unambiguous \nassertions on the uses of stems cells to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as PD \nthat are deployed in the wider, public debate over stem cell technology.  \n \nInterest in the neurosurgical applications of stem cell technology has grown \nextremely rapidly since the first announcement that these cells can be multiplied and \ndifferentiated in vitro (see Kirschstein & Skirboll, 2001). Such interest is motivated \nby the hope that the ability to design cells for degenerating or lost tissue might bring \nabout a cure for key diseases in advanced western societies, affecting the vascular \nand nervous systems of an increasingly elderly population (see Prins, 1998). \nSignificantly, however, some of the most visible supporters of stem cell research have \nbeen the much younger actors Christopher Reeve and Michael J. Fox. While the \nformer, up to his death in 2004, was paralysed from the neck down as a result of an \naccident that damaged his spinal chord, the latter has been diagnosed as suffering \nfrom the early effects of PD (King, 2000; Haber, 2004. See also Brown, S. E. 1996). \nLike Reeve and Fox, the latter of whom has now established his own charitable \nfoundation for the promotion of research into the treatment of PD, most supporters \nof stem cell research suggest that research on the more specific biochemical \nprocesses by which stem cells differentiate and specialise is directly related to the \n  \n14 October 2008: 13 \ndevelopment of effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. \nAlthough arguing from the contrasting point of view, opponents of stem cell research \nfocus overwhelmingly on the troubling, human sources from which stem cells are \nderived, paying little attention to, and thus corroborating, the claims about the \npossible effectiveness of stem cell technology. What both sides of the debate seem to \nignore is how the prospect of soon being able to regenerate dysfunctional cellular \ntissue in situ is informed by the experience acquired in clinical transplants of \nembryonic neuronal tissue, an experience so problematic that it arguably motivates \nthe search for the alternative sources to which Edwards and Nature speak in their \nreactions to the NIH trial (see De Francesco, 2001; Breeze & Wang, 1999).  \n \nThere is, however, another, usually unspoken, reason why stem cell technology is \nvery attractive to proponents of neurotransplantation, and this involves the threat \nthat neurotransplantation poses for the integrity of patients\u2019 personal identity.  \n \nArguably, during the 1970s, neurosurgeons viewed neurotransplantation as an \nopportunity to redefine their repertoire of neurosurgical interventions at a time when \nmany such interventions, for example, lobotomy, lobectomy and cingulotomy, were \nattracting considerable public and professional criticism. These psychosurgical \ninterventions were increasingly viewed as unethical attempts to alter patients\u2019 \npersonal identity (see Valenstein, 1986; Pressman, 1998). Thus, when Detlef Linke, \nan iconoclastic neurologist at the University of Bonn, sought to call the emerging \nfield of intracerebral neurotransplantation into question, he linked its approach to \njust these ethically disreputable interventions (Linke, 1992). Some within the \ncommunity of bioethicists, and Georg Northoff, a philosopher and clinical \npsychiatrist at the University of Magdeburg, in particular, have responded to such \n  \n14 October 2008: 14 \ncriticism by denying that neurotransplantation poses any threat to the integrity of \npatients\u2019 personal identity (Northoff, 1996. See also Boer, 1999; McCrae, 2003). \nInsisting on the empirical grounding of ethical discourse, their denial of the threat \nrests on appeals to contemporary neurobiological knowledge to question any link \nbetween the implantation of biological material in one region of the brain and effects \non another location, specifically the complex neural network that is said to sustain \n\u2018self\u2019 and \u2018identity\u2019 in human subjects. On the other hand, this bootstrapping \nmanoeuvre ignores how psychosurgery and neurotransplantation share the \ncontroversial assumption that particular aspects of \u2018personality\u2019 can be located in \nspecific regions of the brain (see Smith, 1992; Star, 1989; 1992). Furthermore, if the \ndistinctions operated by such mapping of the brain have sometimes proved \ncontroversial, attempting to maintain a categorical distinction between the \n\u2018restoration\u2019 and the \u2018alteration\u2019 of personality provides an alternative strategy for \ndifferentiation between ethically acceptable and unacceptable neurosurgical \ninterventions (see Northoff, 1996). These rhetorical strategies are particularly \nevident in Robert Breeze and Marjorie Wang\u2019s technical review of developments in \nthe field of neurotransplantation. While they acknowledge common historical origins \nand epistemic assumptions, they seek to distance neurotransplantation from the like \nof lobotomy, lobectomy and cingulotomy by associating the latter with \u2018so-called \nfunctional neurosurgery (emphasis added)\u2019, despite many of our actors\u2019 explicit \ndisciplinary identification with the very same field of \u2018functional neurosurgery\u2019. \nFurthermore, they emphasise the difference between \u2018destruction\u2019 and \u2018restoration\u2019 \nof neural tissue, despite the dependence of \u2018restoration\u2019 on the introduction of \nexogenous neural tissue such that \u2018alteration\u2019 and \u2018restoration\u2019 are in fact \nconceptually indistinguisheable (Breeze & Wang, 1999). Stem cell technology would \nseem, however, to provide a technical solution to these ethical problems. In fact, the \n  \n14 October 2008: 15 \nprospect of initiating the \u2018self-repair\u2019 of the brain with undifferentiated and \npluripotent cellular tissue would seem to offer a definitive closure of the ethical \nproblem. As a review of investments by the biotechnology industry in the field of \nneurotransplantation put it, there will have been no therapeutic intervention because \n\u2018neural stem cells [will] act as nature\u2019s own brain surgeon, psychiatrist, pharmacist, \nand therapist\u2019 (Spalding, 2000; see also Boer, 1999; Grisol\u00eda, 2002).  \n \nImportantly, the promotion of \u2018self-repair\u2019, motivated by these disparate social and \nhistorical considerations, reinforces a vision of the \u2018self\u2019 for which there are \nidentifiable neural boundaries and pathways. We suggest that such reinforcement of \nthe \u2018self\u2019 as the unrelated, yet pivotal, issue for stem cell research points towards an \noperative absence or blank presence in the debate over neurotransplantation for PD. \nWe therefore return to the debate over the NIH trial. \n \nThe \u2018regime of hope\u2019 and the \u2018regime of truth\u2019  \nFrom the description given in the sections above, it is possible to see the debate over \nthe NIH trial as evolving around two alternative positions. On the one hand, there \nare those actors who view the trial as demonstrating the worthlessness of the \nneurosurgical approach and those who cannot see any justification to continue \nsubmitting patients to expensive, hazardous treatments and ethically questionable \nresearch practices. On the other hand, there are those actors who view the trial as an \nexample of how not to conduct research, but then point to the success of the \nneurosurgical approach in animals as reason for continued investment. We suggest \nthat these two positions can be understood as deploying more general forms of \nargument, which, rhetorically, revolve around the tropes of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019. \n  \n14 October 2008: 16 \nSignificantly, the actors in the debate over the NIH trial, and even within the more \nbroadly defined field of neurotransplantation, deploy these two tropes both \nrepeatedly and in a patterned manner that articulates distinct subject positions. \nMoreover, the deployment of the two tropes can be analysed further, in terms of \ndistinct orderings and aggregations of actors. These orderings and aggregations \nconstitute the formations in, and through, which these same actors construct and \nadjust their positions in debates around the purpose and value of biomedicine. In \ndoing so, these formations generate and perform distributions, defining or \nembodying a characteristic approach to what might, does, or should, pass from \nwhom to what, under what circumstances (Law, 1994). In other words, they generate \nand perform distinctive distributions of value, power and agency around the \u2018patient\u2019 \nor \u2018sufferer\u2019 of the condition under debate (see Rose & Novas, 2000; Brown, N. 2003; \nBrown, N. & Michael, 2003).   \n \nThe \u2018regime of hope\u2019 is characterised by the view that new and better treatments are \nalways about to come, being tested, \u2018in the pipeline\u2019. More specifically, research and \ndevelopment is justified by the promise of finding miraculous cures for debilitating \ndiseases. Such promise entails endless deferrals to stabilise the identity of the \ntherapy, its constituents and effects, a deferral that can be justified in various \nmanners. In the case on hand, these tactical deferrals range from NECTAR\u2019s \nmethodological critique of the NIH trial to arguments over the appropriate nature \nand quantity of embryonic neural material that should be used for more effective \ntransplants. In fact, if the responses to the NIH trial are at all imprinted by the public \ndebates over the sources of the materials used in technologies such as the \ntransplantation of embryonic neuronal material, their traces are to be found in the \narguments over the large quantity of foetal material required for successful \n  \n14 October 2008: 17 \nimplantation and the feasibility of xenotransplantation, the transplantation of \nbiological material across species, as an alternative, more copious and less \nproblematic source of implants (Fink, 2000; Hagel & Brundin, 2001; see also \nClemmit, 1992). The following opposition of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019 perhaps best captures \nthe spirit of such deferrals: \u2018We do not know the truth: there is hope\u2019.  \n \nThe \u2018regime of truth\u2019, on the other hand, entails an investment in what is positively \nknown, rather than what can be. That is to say, it is characterised by the view that \nmost medical therapies are less effective than claimed, and this involves the constant \nreturning of new and promising approaches to their original claims, their clinical \nfailures and to their ethical downfalls. Thus, for some actors, the NIH trial \ndemonstrated what they already knew, namely that neurotransplantation was an \nineffective therapy. For others, the NIH trial was populated by a series of biological \nand methodological problems that were not compatible with the practices of \nveridicity in contemporary health care (Moreira, 2004). The Blue Cross\/Blue Shield \nTechnology Evaluation Center\u2019s conclusion about the relative merits of the surgical \nand pharmacological approaches exemplifies this view, which can be then opposed to \nthe \u2018regime of hope\u2019 by a quite different opposition of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019. These actors \nseem to be saying: \u2018We know the truth: there is no hope\u2019. It is important to recall, at \nthis point, that, although the pharmacological approach to the treatment of PD might \nbe said to be a \u2018tried and tested\u2019 one, it explicitly entails recognition that death is \ninevitable. \n \nAround these two recurrent positionings we find different aggregations of actors. The \n\u2018regime of hope\u2019 draws together new biotechnology companies such as ReNeuron \nPLC, and the investors in these companies, all of whom depend upon the promise of \n  \n14 October 2008: 18 \nthe neurosurgical approach for a return on their investment of financial capital; there \nalso are neurobiologists, who construct models of degenerative diseases, and the \nneurologists and neurosurgeons, all of whom have dedicated large part of their \ncareers and intellectual capital to the development of neurotransplantation. Finally, \nthere are charities such as the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society, whose aim is to maintain \nall possibilities of treatment open. The \u2018regime of truth\u2019 aggregates a very different \nset of groups of actors. Here we find the \u2018therapeutic reformers\u2019 in the NIH who set \nup and assessed the methodological quality of the trial (see Marks, 1997). There also \nare health care buyers and insurers, such as Blue Cross\/Blue Shield, who are not \nconvinced that the considerable costs of the neurosurgical approach are justified, all \ntoo aware of a fundamental difference between \u2018tried and tested\u2019 measures and \ndevelopments in \u2018investigational settings\u2019 (see Blue Cross\/Blue Shield, 2004). \nImportantly, there also are those pharmaceutical companies worried about the \ncompetition from new molecular approaches to the treatment of PD (see Bracco, \n2002). \n \nFinally, the \u2018regime of hope\u2019 and the \u2018regime of truth\u2019 differ in the way they imagine \nand configure the patient. In the \u2018regime of hope\u2019, actors tend to figure the patient as \nsomeone who is invested in becoming less entrapped by their physical condition; this \npatient may sometimes be desperate, but they are always waiting for new solutions to \ntheir entrapment. In the \u2018regime of truth\u2019, by contrast, patients are figured as \nconsumers of health care, concerned to compare the relative merits of \npharmacological and surgical approaches, by taking into consideration their \neffectiveness, risk of harm, and cost. In their opposing configurations of the patient, \nthe two regimes both attempt to distribute knowledge and agency between expert \n  \n14 October 2008: 19 \nand the lay public, and thus to engage, some might say to \u2018interpellate\u2019, the patient\u2019s \n\u2018self\u2019 from different perspectives (Althusser, 1994).  \n \nStrikingly, the different subjectivities enacted by the \u2018regime of truth\u2019 and the \u2018regime \nof hope\u2019 resonate with contemporary debates about embodiment and political \nsubjectivity, which we suggest are important to explore, if we are to more fully \nunderstand the predicament confronting the Lambert family.   \n \nThe \u2018politics of life\u2019 versus the \u2018politics of death\u2019 \nWhen researching the debate over the NIH trial, we progressively realized, perhaps \nunsurprisingly, that social scientists are not removed observers of the regimes of \n\u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019, but active participants in their constitution (Dehue, 2002). Those \nsocial scientists who view the neurosurgical approach as another example of \nunjustified hype surrounding contemporary biomedicine, and maintain that \nmedicine has not in fact changed the way we live since the introduction of basic \npublic health measures in the nineteenth century, can readily be associated with the \n\u2018regime of truth\u2019. For them, the truth is that we have always begun to die the day we \nwere born, and nothing has changed, biological life continuing to be norm against \nwhich politics must be judged. On the other side, we find social scientists either \ncelebrating or worrying about how science is enabling humans to go beyond their \nsupposedly fixed, biological abilities. Their argument is that we are creating the \nnorms of our own life (see Mykhalovskyi & Weir, 2004; Caplan, 2003). What is at \nstake in this opposition is intimately linked with the important contrast between the \nperspectives on embodiment and political subjectivity articulated by Michel Foucault \n  \n14 October 2008: 20 \nand Giorgio Agamben, on the one hand, and Paul Rabinow and Nikolas Rose, on the \nother.  \n \nThis link is observable when we interrogate the modes of reproduction of both \nregimes. The ultimate aim of the \u2018regime of truth\u2019 is closure, each argumentative \nmove returning to its point of origin, to the original question, to the truth of the \nmatter. As such, it rests on the representation of the state of affairs as it is now, \nenacting a regime in which the collective is organised around the norm of life, as it is \nand always has been. Agamben usefully articulates the full implications of such \norganisation by questioning the extent to which Foucault\u2019s labelling of the modern \nlink between embodiment and political subjectivity as \u2018biopolitical\u2019 is in fact a \nmisnomer. For Agamben, \u2018biopolitics\u2019, the productive deployment of the known \ngenerative powers of life to regulate and manage political existence, rests on the \nproduction of a form of being that is endowed with no potential and that is in \nsuspension between life and death, \u2018bare life\u2019 (Agamben, 1998; see also Foucault, \n1990: 150-159). The most vivid and relevant exemplification of this pivotal concept \nare the \u2018brain dead\u2019, who are biologically \u2018alive\u2019, but socially and juridico-politically \n\u2018dead\u2019 (Agamben, 1998: 160-165; see also Lock, 2002). As such, the \u2018biopolitical\u2019 is \nbetter understood as a \u2018politics of death\u2019, a \u2018thanatopolitics\u2019. The main resource for \nthe \u2018regime of hope\u2019 is instead capital, whose reproduction demands a belief in a \nfuture rather than a resignation to, or an investment in, the present. The future, \nrather than the past, is this regime\u2019s distinctive temporal orientation. Continuous \nopening of action, with no point of return, is its strategic aim. The \u2018regime of hope\u2019 \nthus enacts what Rabinow and Rose have called the \u2018politics of life\u2019, a mode of \nexistence characterised by the endless possibilities of humanity as it finally comes to \nterms with its embodiment. Again, the most vivid and relevant exemplification of this \n  \n14 October 2008: 21 \nunderstanding is the emerging figure of the \u2018neurochemical self\u2019, deeply enmeshed in \na world where the staid, historical boundaries between \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 are \neverywhere shattered (Rose, 2003. See also Rabinow, 1996; Rabinow & Rose, 2003). \n \nThese two contrasting views on embodiment and subjectivity powerfully resonate \nwith differing views of the relationship between the neurosurgical approach to PD \nand stem cell technology, particular in relation to the question of \u2018self-repair\u2019. If the \n\u2018politics of death\u2019 seems more aligned with a critique of the suspension of human life \nentailed by stem cell \u2018culture\u2019, much, as Agamben would put it, in the same way that \nconcentrations camps operated, constructing the \u2018self-repairing\u2019 body might be \nunderstood as marking the achievement of the alignment that Rabinow and Rose \nimagine, and it must necessarily be \u2018imagined\u2019, given the temporal structure of the \n\u2018regime of hope\u2019. In sum, in the debate about the character of contemporary political \nsubjectivity, the opposition of \u2018thanatopolitics\u2019 and \u2018biopolitics\u2019 beautifully \nencapsulates the struggle that contemporary biomedicine rehearses over human \nsubjectivity. \n \nQuestioning \u2018self-repair\u2019: A technical interlude \nBecause we have argued that \u2018self repair\u2019 sustains the boundary between the \u2018politics \nof life\u2019 and the \u2018politics of death\u2019, we would now like to a draw attention to two \nproblems concerning the goal of \u2018self repair\u2019, which, if we are to credit the network of \ncitations linked to the final report on the NIH trial that we generated through \nMEDLINE, on 20 February 2004, would appear to be recognised within the field of \nneurotransplantation itself. \n \n  \n14 October 2008: 22 \nThe first problem is how to best understand the loss of control over motor function. \nOne position draws on a dopaminergic understanding, whereby PD is defined as a \nmalfunction of the physiological systems controlling the production and distribution \nof dopamine. The effectiveness of the neurosurgical approach is then determined, \nfirstly, by the relative success in implanting the embryonic material, secondly, by the \nincreased uptake of dopamine, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), \nand, thirdly, by the correlation between the first two and post-operative motor \ncontrol. The latter is usually assessed by standardised tests such as the Unified \nParkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale, which measures \u2018finger dexterity, supination-\npronation, foot tapping, and \u2018stand-walk-sit\u201d (Kopyov, 1996: 327; see also Price, \n1995; Sass, 1995). \n   \nFigure 3: PET scans before (L) and after (R) implantation (see Dumit, 2003). \n \nWhile the first two criteria were initially distinguished from the third one in terms of \n\u2018therapeutic\u2019 versus \u2018clinical\u2019 effects, presumably due to doubts about the causal \nrelationship between the degeneration of the striatum region of the brain and motor \ncontrol, the distinction was gradually relaxed in the wake of increasing evidence that \n  \n14 October 2008: 23 \nsuccessful grafting led to some improvement in motor control. The relaxation was \nnever total, however, perhaps betraying continuing uncertainty about the \ndopaminergic definition of PD (see Lindvall, 1989; Peschanski, 1994; Kordower, \n1995). In fact, even before the NIH trial was closed, Ivar Mendez, Director of the \nNeural Transplantation Laboratory at Dalhousie University, and his two students, \nArun Ramachandran and Lynsey Bartlett, observed that while \u2018many transplant \nrecipients obtain clinically useful symptom relief \u2026 in all cases functional recovery is \nincomplete\u2019 (Ramachandran, Bartlett & Mendez, 2000: 243; emphasis added).  \nThis further taxonomic complication might suggest that Mendez\u2019 position is closer to \nthe definition of PD offered in the report by the Blue Cross\/Blue Shield Technology \nEvaluation Center, which includes a range of psychological symptoms whose causal \nrelationship to motor control is left open, perhaps \u2018because the degenerative nature \nof Parkinson\u2019s Disease is not restricted solely to the dopaminergic systems\u2019 (Blue \nCross\/Blue Shield Technology Evaluation Center, 2001: 1).  \n \nStrikingly, however, Mendez has recently suggested that a better way forward for the \nneurosurgical treatment of PD may be to insert dopaminergic implants not just in the \nstriatum, but also in the nigral region of the brain (Mendez, 2002; see also Hagell, \n2002). Mendez thus reasserts the importance of the dopaminergic definition of PD, \nbut also begs questions about the cerebral localisation of PD. It is important to note, \nmoreover, that this answer is not motivated by criticism such as that voiced by the \nBlue Cross\/Blue Shield Technology Evaluation Center, but is instead generated by an \naltogether different \u2018truth-making engine\u2019 best exemplified by NECTAR. This said, \nthe second problem is that, even disregarding the difficulties confronting the \ndopaminergic definition, so vocally championed by NECTAR, experimental controls \nare not easily established. As Paul Morrish, Guy Sawle and David Brooks, from the \n  \n14 October 2008: 24 \nMedical Research Council Cyclotron Unit at Hammersmith Hospital, noted while the \nNIH trial was in progress, \u2018Parkinson\u2019s Disease has a widely variable rate of \nprogression\u2019, so that linking its stage of development to changes in dopamine levels is \nan \u2018insufficiently sensitive\u2019 diagnostic tool (Morrish, Sawle & Brooks, 1995: 597; see \nalso Sawle, 1992; Remy, 1995; Rinne, 1999). Consequently, it has proved difficult to \nquantify the specific dopaminergic effects of the implants in the context of the \noverall, continuing degeneration of the striatum (Piccini, 1999). More importantly, \nhowever, the distinction between the dopaminergic effects of the implanted material \nand the degenerating striatum would seem to betray the notion that the successful \nimplantation of embryonic neuronal material is a step toward the goal of \u2018self-repair\u2019. \nIf this is simply a matter of temporal sequence, whose horizon is the disappearance \nof any difference between exogenous implants and endogenous tissue, it is worth \nnoting that Warren Olanow, at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and a leading \nfigure in the field of neurotransplantation, has disputed that the dyskinesias, the \nuncontrolled movements, observed in the treatment group in the NIH trial were due \nto an unexpected overactivity of the implanted tissue, and has argued that they may \ninstead have been due to an immune response, which could not be excluded because \nthose involved in the trial did not use any immunosuppressants (Olanow, 2003).  \n \nIn the light of these above two problems, neurotransplantation remains closer to the \nengineering of a heterologous remedy, not fundamentally different to the \npharmacological treatment for PD, championed by the Blue Cross\/Blue Shield \nTechnology Evaluation Center, than to achieving the autologous \u2018self-repair\u2019 of the \nbrain promoted by the biotechnology industry, which foresees \u2018neural stem cells \n[becoming] nature\u2019s own brain surgeon, psychiatrist, pharmacist, and therapist\u2019. \n \n  \n14 October 2008: 25 \nQuestioning \u2018self-repair\u2019: A theoretical excursus \nIf, up to this point, the regimes of \u2018hope\u2019 and \u2018truth\u2019 seemed to be two diametrically \nopposed versions of the values of biomedicine, through the notion of \u2018self-repair\u2019 and \nthe debates over its technical problems it is possible to see how these two regimes are \nin fact predicated on each other. Again, it is through the resonance between the \ndebates about PD and those about the relationship between embodiment and \npolitical subjectivity, that it is possible to understand how the interlocking of the two \nregimes is mediated through the manner in which they imagine and configure the \n\u2018self\u2019.  \n \nIn the context of advancing a \u2018politics of life\u2019, Paul Rabinow has opposed Michel \nFoucault\u2019s \u2018will to knowledge\u2019 with a \u2018will to experiment\u2019, which he characterises as \n\u2018an experimental mode of inquiry \u2026 where one confronts a problem whose answer is \nnot known in advance rather than already having answers and then seeking a \nproblem\u2019 (Rabinow, 1999: 174. See also Rabinow, 2003; Foucault, 2000). In so \ndoing, however, Rabinow overlooks how any experiment always is simultaneously \nlocated within two distinct temporal frames. On the one hand, it is orientated toward \na future event, such as the stabilisation of the neurosurgical approach to the \ntreatment of PD and the realisation of all that it promises for the future of humanity. \nSuch orientation towards the future can be said to be the distinctive temporality of \nthe \u2018regime of hope\u2019. Its strategy is maximising. Such maximising, and therefore \npotentiating, orientation, whether practical, as is the case with the exponents of \nneurotransplantation, or philosophical, as is the case for the \u2018will to experiment\u2019, \nmust be necessarily shaped by a deployment of the past and its problems, however. \nWhen expectations of the experiment are not met, as was the case in the NIH trial, \n  \n14 October 2008: 26 \nthis is not the end, but it none the less requires reflection and investment in what is \nknown to proceed beyond the present (see Cussins, 1998). In other words, to begin to \narticulate an alternative approach, it is necessary to retrace the path and reassess \nwhat is known. In the case of the \u2018will to experiment\u2019, it entails a reflection on the \nhistory of thought about the relationship between embodiment and political \nsubjectivity, from the mediaeval invention of the \u2018purgatory\u2019 to the modern concept \nof \u2018human dignity\u2019 (Rabinow, 1999). As such, the process of articulating the future \ninvolves engagement with the \u2018regime of truth\u2019, whose practices of veridicity are \ngrounded in the past and are strategically minimizing. From this perspective, the \nNIH trial represents a return to the point of departure, from which it is possible to \nelaborate new questions. In this same process, however, the \u2018regime of truth\u2019 \nconfronts the minimal answer with an expanding horizon of possible questions, \nwhose proliferation is none the less necessary to guarantee the continuity of the \n\u2018regime of truth\u2019.  \n \nIf the regimes of \u2018hope\u2019 and \u2018truth\u2019 can then be said to include each other in the very \nsame moment that actors articulate their differences, the relationship between two \nregimes is best conceived as one of \u2018mutual parasitism\u2019. As one of us has argued \nelsewhere: \n \nMutual parasitism corresponds to a looping process through which different knowledge \npractices \u2013 or regimes - progressively generate their own epistemic resources by \ntranslating each others\u2019. In appropriating each other\u2019s resources, these knowledges create \na composite. This composite, however, is never truly harmonised as it depends upon the \nasymmetries and heterogeneities these knowledges can create between them (Moreira, in \npress).  \n \n  \n14 October 2008: 27 \nIn other words, the regimes of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019 assume, if they do not in fact \nrequire, a single, determinate and common point of reference to which it is possible \nto return or from which it is possible to depart and differ from. Not only do the \nopposing regimes depend upon this agreed entity, but it also is the common \ncondition of possibility for their continuous disagreement. We suggest that such \npoint of reference is the \u2018self\u2019.  \n \nWhile any reference to the \u2018self\u2019 is notably absent from the debates over both the \ngoals and effectiveness of the neurosurgical approach, the opposing positions can be \nunderstood as either assuming a fixed \u2018self\u2019 that can possibly recover pre-existing \npotentialities, or as aspiring to re-launch a neurophysiological dynamic from which a \nnew \u2018self\u2019 can emerge. A similar interlocking opposition is evident in the way in which \nthe regimes of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019 imagine the PD patient. While one imagines a \npatient who is sometimes desperate, but always waiting and ready to test new and \npromising, but untested, solutions to their situation, the other imagines a patient \nwho is concerned to compare the positively known merits of alternative approaches \nto forestalling their demise. Strikingly, this same commonly centred opposition is \nstill more sharply evident in Agamben, Rose and Rabinow\u2019s reflections on \nembodiment and political subjectivity. For the latter two, the contemporary, \nembodied \u2018self\u2019 is to be understood as so constantly under erasure as to become \nincreasingly synonymous with \u2018life itself\u2019 (Rose, 2001). For Agamben, this equation, \nwhich he labels \u2018bare life\u2019, undoubtedly is deeply troubling, but, paradoxically, it also \nis, to use Michel Foucault\u2019s famous phrase, the key to \u2018to counter[ing] the grips of \npower\u2019 (Foucault, 1990: 157. See also Agamben, 1999a).  \n \n  \n14 October 2008: 28 \nIn sum, the composite of the regimes of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019 constitutes and maintains \nthe existence of the \u2018self\u2019, both as the ultimate truth and the greatest hope. In this \nprocess, the \u2018self\u2019 becomes unavoidable, confirmed at every turn of the debate, \nprogressively established as the only path for public engagement and the main \nobligation of the subject. In sum, the \u2018self\u2019 becomes the one and only vehicle of \nsubjectification. \n \nWho is Alfred? \nWe opened the paper by asking: Why is Alfred not interested in getting better? Why \nwill he not at least admit to the hopelessness of his situation? We seem, however, to \nhave failed to answer these questions. In fact, if anything, our argument leads to the \nview Alfred\u2019s disengagement is unintelligible. How are we to understand Alfred\u2019s \ndisengagement from both the \u2018regime of truth\u2019, which would require him to both \nrecognise the hopelessness of his situation and to make suitable arrangements in this \nlight, and the \u2018regime of hope\u2019 advanced by the Axon Corporation? How are we to \nunderstand his non-engagement with the two versions of \u2018self\u2019 proposed by the \nregimes of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019, equally represented by the other four members of the \nLambert family? How are we to account for his refusal, his very absence? In other \nwords, how are we to understand obscurity, dependent as we are upon the \njustificatory frames that actors offer to us to understand their worlds? Michel Callon \nand Vololona Rabeharisoa have recently formulated this very same question, with \nregard to Gino, a silent sufferer of muscular dystrophy (Callon & Rabeharisoa, 2004). \nConfronting such silence, they set out to argue that Gino, as a person, expresses a \nconfrontation two sets of demands. On the one hand, there are the demands of the \npublic sphere, for the visibility, articulation and debatability of his reasons for \n  \n14 October 2008: 29 \nrefusing any engagement with the world of biomedicine. On the other hand, there are \nthe demands for opacity, non-argumentation and exclusion that would seem to be \nGino\u2019s way of life. Yet, in attempting to describe and understand Gino\u2019s silence, \nCallon and Rabeharisoa cannot but endow him with a subjectivity, that is, an ability \nto position himself outside the arena of biomedical discourse and techniques. Gino\u2019s \nefforts to make his actions, and, more importantly, himself, opaque to others are, at \nleast partly, an effect of Callon and Rabeharisoa\u2019s very presence and interpellation. \nMoreover, by attempting to make Gino\u2019s desire for opacity visible, Callon and \nRabeharisoa are also working against the non-accountability Gino would appear to \ndesire most. This was perhaps inevitable. As Callon and Rabeharisoa note, the social \nand human sciences cannot but fail to multiply local ways of being, locked as they are \nin addressing public issues. At the same time, however, Callon and Rabearisoa also \ndirect our attention to the way in which, as we move towards obscurity and \nindeterminate ways of being, the ability to position and recognise oneself in action is \nprogressively lost. Such loss is beautifully expressed in Jonathan Frazen\u2019s \ndescription, in the extract given in the beginning of the paper, of Alfred\u2019s momentary \nexperience of disconnection:  \n \nIn the instant of realizing he was lost, time became marvellously slow and he discovered \nhitherto unguessed eternities in the space between one word and the next, or rather he \nbecame trapped in that space between words and could only stand and watch as time \nsped on without him (emphasis added). \n \nThrough the literary artefact that is The Corrections, and it cannot be otherwise, \nFranzen attempts to give voice to an experience of transcendence that is beyond \nwords, space and time. In this way, we are able to glimpse both the experience of dis-\nlocation and self-lessness, and its obscurity. Yet, in the very moment in which such \nglimpse is achieved, it loses its significance because what we glimpse is the emptiness \n  \n14 October 2008: 30 \nof our own sight. What is left, is a feeling for the precariousness of our own selves, \nhow we, like Albert, can \u2018slip through\u2019 the tightly fit links between our environments \nand ourselves and not find ourselves anymore. In returning to clarity and \naccountability, we realise that this slippage is beyond our control, beyond ourselves \nand beyond words. It happens to us so that we are not always, already \u2026 \n \n POSTSCRIPT: A DIALOGUE \nPaolo: Perhaps, however, more could be said about the tension between making the \nexperience visible and the obscurities it produces in the very process of \nrepresentation, because this obscurity is precisely that \u2018bare life\u2019 with which Giorgio \nAgamben is so concerned (Agamben, 1998; 1999b).  \n \nTiago: But aren\u2019t you still attempting to represent obscurity by giving it a name, and \ndescribing it as a suspension that produces the very process of representation? I am \nnot sure that is the solution to this predicament. Perhaps what Michel Callon and \nVololona Rabeharisoa address is part of a much more general ambition of western \nphilosophy to \u2018represent\u2019 and fix on \u2018what is\u2019, on ontology (Jullien, 2002). Perhaps \nour ability to represent is predicated upon our realisation that there is an \nunrepresentable, but attempting to then represent this unrepresentable seems to \nundermine the key tension between clarity\/self and obscurity\/other.  \n \nPaolo: I agree with you totally \u2026 but \u2026 why are Callon and Rabeharisoa so taken \nwith, and endebted to, Gino, if not as a figure of the limit? I cannot help but recall the \nfollowing, perceptive historical observation, from Michel Foucault\u2019s Order of Things: \n \n  \n14 October 2008: 31 \nMan and the unthought are \u2026 contemporaries. Man has not been able to describe himself \nas a configuration in an episteme without thought at the same time discovering, both in \nitself and outside itself, at its borders yet also in its very warp and woof, an element of \ndarkness, an apparently inert density in which it is embedded \u2026 (Foucault, 1970: 326; see \nalso Deleuze, 1988). \n \nI would then want to \u2018gesture\u2019 toward Agamben\u2019s and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\u2019s diagnoses of this \nsituation (Agamben, 2000; see also \u017di\u017eek, 1999). In other words, I would want to \nemphasise the historical specificity of the situation in which the \u2018he\u2019 in \u2018in the instant \nof realizing he was lost, time became marvellously slow and he discovered hitherto \nunguessed eternities in the space between one word and the next, or rather he \nbecame trapped in that space between words and could only stand and watch as time \nsped on without him\u2019 must be said to lose any valence in itself and by itself. The point \nof this \u2018gesture\u2019 is that our, dare I say poetic, evocation of something about the \nhuman that is \u2018not always, already\u2019 should be understood as willing the return of \ncritical practice to something that is not simply the inert medium of discursive \nmachinery, be it \u2018bare life\u2019 or a \u2018platform\u2019 (see Keating & Cambrosio, 2003), but as \nsomething that causes both the machinery and associated critical apparatus to stutter \nand splutter. Toward the end of his own life, Gilles Deleuze spoke of it as \u2018a life \u2026\u2019 \n(see Agamben 1999c; Palladino, 2003). \n \nTiago: <Silence> \n \nTiago and Paolo: <Wry laughter> \n  \n14 October 2008: 32 \n Bibliography \nAgamben, G.
