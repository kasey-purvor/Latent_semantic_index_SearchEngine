Introduction\nThis paper re-examines a familiar topic \u2013 the link between new firm formation and\nsubsequent employment growth. Its novelty is to pose the almost heretical question of\nwhether it is possible to have \u201cthe wrong type of entrepreneurship\u201d \u2013 defined as new\nfirm formation which leads to zero or even negative subsequent employment growth.\nThe importance of the question is reflected in the efforts of public policy makers\nthroughout the world to seek to raise new firm formation on the grounds that this will\nlead to additional employment. In principle it is clear that if a new firm is created and it\nemploys, either as an owner or as an employee, an individual who was formerly not\nemployed, then this adds to aggregate employment in the economy.\nThis paper, however, makes it clear that additional employment resulting from new firm\nformation activity is achieved only when certain key assumptions are made. The first is\nthat it is possible for policy makers to take actions which stimulate new firm formation.\nSecond, that it is the policy, and not macro economic circumstances, that cause the\nchange.\nA third and very important assumption is that it is new firm formation which causes\nincreased employment and not vice versa, since increased employment may be the\ncause rather than the consequence of higher start-up rates. This is because local demand\nis likely to be higher when employment increases, so stimulating the creation of new\nfirms. As these two mechanisms differ greatly in their policy implications, it is of vital\nimportance to disentangle the correct direction of causality.\nThe final, and key, assumption is that not only is the immediate employment impact\nquantified, but also any subsequent employment change attributable to the new firm. In\norder to address this issue we utilise the framework formulated by Fritsch and Mueller\n4(2004). They show the creation of a new firm has both immediate and longer term\nconsequences. As noted above, new firms have an easily identifiable short term direct\neffect in creating employment, but they also have two longer term consequences. The\nfirst is that new firms displace inefficient incumbents, which may lead to job losses in\nthe medium term. A second medium term consequence is that the new firms grow\nthemselves and also enhance the competitiveness of firms that remain in business1,\nacting as a threat to incumbent firms inducing improved performance from them. As\nFritsch and Mueller (2004) show, the effect of new entrants is therefore threefold: the\nfirst effect is to increase employment, the second is to lower employment and the third\nis to increase employment. The total effect upon employment can therefore be either\npositive or negative and depends upon the magnitude of the three elements.\nThis paper applies the Fritsch and Mueller (2004) approach to data for Great Britain in\norder to examine our central question of whether some entrepreneurship is \u201cbetter\u201d than\nothers. Given that those countries and\/or regions with both low rates of new firm\nformation and low employment levels are most likely to implement such policies, this\npaper asks whether the short, medium and long term job creation effects of new firm\nformation differ between areas. Specifically, do new firms started in low\nentrepreneurship areas have a weaker job creation impact than those started in high\nentrepreneurship areas?\nTo test this, the paper examines the effects of new firm formation on subsequent\nemployment change between 1981 and 2003 for Great Britain. It makes two\ndistinctions. The first is between England on the one hand and Scotland and Wales on\n1 Disney, Haskel and Hedon (2003) find that in the UK between 1980 and 1992 about half of productivity\ngain was because of internal factors \u2013 such as introducing new technology and organisational changes.\nThe remaining half was because of external factors most notably that the entrants were more productive\nthan those exiting. However amongst single plant independent firms almost all the gains were attributable\nto external factors.\n5the other. This is because the policy regime was different, particularly in Scotland,\nduring the period in question. A second distinction is made by pooling all geographical\nareas in the three countries, ranking them on the basis of new firm formation, and then\ncomparing the bottom quartile areas with the other areas.\nOur broad key finding is that, for Great Britain as a whole and England in particular, the\neffect of new firm formation on subsequent employment growth is positive. Hence new\nfirm formation led subsequently to increased employment in that country during this\nperiod. However, we do not get the same results for Scotland and Wales, nor for the\nlower quartile regions, none of which are located in East Anglia, the Midlands or the\nSouth of England. For Scotland and Wales the overall impact of new firm formation is\nconsiderably smaller compared to England. For the lower quartile regions of Great\nBritain as a whole (mainly regions in Scotland and the North East of England) the effect\nis negative, implying that the aggregate long term impact of new firm formation \u2013 and\nthe impact of policies to raise new firm formation \u2013 may be negative. Our final section\ndiscusses the possible regionally regressive implications of entrepreneurship policy.\nThe paper begins with a brief review of the original Fritsch and Mueller (2004) model,\nprimarily to provide an understanding of the circumstances under which the\nemployment consequences of entrepreneurship can be either positive, zero or negative.\nIt then turns to examine the policy context in Great Britain over the last two decades in\nwhich the emphasis upon new firm formation has fluctuated markedly. The data are set\nout in Section 5, the analysis in Section 6 with our interpretation of the implications in\nSection 7.\n2. Literature overview\n6Fritsch and Mueller\u2019s (2004) work on Germany provided both a model and a test of\ntime lags in the relationship between new firm formation and employment change.\nThey theorised that new firm formation had three effects which are shown in Figure I.\nThe first effect was a short term direct effect of employment created by the new firm.\nThe second was the displacement effect of the entrant causing existing firms to go out\nof business, hence incurring job losses. Finally, the third effect is to stimulate better\nperformance from surviving firms. This is called the induced effect.\nApplying this theory to German data Fritsch and Mueller (2004) find support for the\nthree phase model. They concluded that the peak of positive impact of new firms on\nregional economic development was reached about eight years after entry, and\ndisappeared after about a decade. Using a broadly similar approach, van Stel and Storey\n(2004) examined Great Britain for the period 1981 to 1998. Their conclusions were\nsimilar to those of Fritsch and Mueller (2004). They found the employment impact of\nnew firm formation was maximised after five years but had declined to zero by year\nnine.2\ndirect effect\ninduced effect\ndisplacement effect\nI\nIII\nII\n0\nIm\npa\nct\nof\nne\nw\nbu\nsi\nne\nss\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\non\nem\npl\noy\nm\nen\ntc\nha\nng\ne\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nLag (year)\nIm\npa\nct\nof\nne\nw\nbu\nsi\nne\nss\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\non\nem\npl\noy\nm\nen\ntc\nha\nng\ne\n2 A disadvantage of their exercises was that they restricted the Almon lag polynomial to be of second\ndegree while Fritsch and Mueller showed that a third degree polynomial may actually be more realistic.\n7Figure I: Schematic effects of new firm formation on employment change (according\nto Fritsch and Mueller, 2004)\nIn the context of the current paper, the important finding of van Stel and Storey (2004)\nis that in \u2018un-entrepreneurial areas\u2019, such as North-East England and Scotland, the\nemployment effect was not consistently positive. Figure I provides a good context for\nunderstanding these matters. Assume two regions A and B. Region A is prosperous\nand has high rates of new firm formation. Region B is the reverse. In principle, for the\nemployment consequences of new firm formation in the two regions to differ then the\ncase has to be made for some or all of the following: lower Phase I employment, higher\nPhase II and\/or lower Phase III employment.\nOur case is that the employment consequences of public policies intended to raise new\nfirm formation would be lower in the low income, low enterprise areas. Our assumption\nis that areas of low enterprise \u2013 Region B \u2013 have the documented characteristics of Tees\nValley in Northern England (Greene et al., 2004): individuals with low levels of\neducation, low levels of home ownership, low house prices, low in-migration, high\nunemployment, a high proportion of manufacturing employment, heavily concentrated\nin large plants, low levels of research and development and low proportions of business\nservice employment. Our second assumption is that public policies to raise new firm\nformation rates are implemented. We now speculate on the expected differential impact\nof these policies in Regions A and B.\nPhase I: New firms started by individuals in Region B are likely to be smaller in Phase I\nthan those in Region A. This is because such individuals have less wealth since they are\nboth less likely to own a property than those in Region A and that property is of lower\nvalue. They also have less borrowing power than those in Region A because of lower\neducational qualifications and poorer business prospects because, since most small\n8firms sell locally, market conditions are likely to be less buoyant. New firms in Region\nB are more likely to be started in sectors with low entry barriers such as personal\nservices3 where capital requirements are modest and skills and expertise are widely\navailable. The only advantage that businesses in Region B may have is in being able to\naccess public support such as finance and advice, which is less likely to be available in\nRegion A.\nPhase II: If new firms started by individuals in Region B are both financed initially\nfrom public funds and heavily concentrated in low skill personal services, then their\nshort term effect will be to displace existing providers of such services on grounds of\nprice. There will therefore be a bigger negative impact in Phase II in Region B than\nRegion A where both the firms are \u201cbetter\u201d and do not receive a temporary subsidy.\nPhase III: In this phase the employment created reflects the growth in both the new\nfirms and those whose performance has been enhanced as a result of the competition\nprovided by the entrants. Here again the case is that the employment growth of firms in\nthis phase will be lower in Region B than in Region A. This reflects the lower levels of\nentrepreneurial expertise of the owners of firms in Region B and the less buoyant\nmarket conditions in that region.\nOverall therefore Figure I shows that there are three phases of employment creation\nassociated with new firm formation and that whilst Phase I would be expected to be\npositive, the inclusion of Phase II and Phase III makes this more ambiguous. Secondly,\nwe argue that the magnitude of the employment created in each phase is different in\nprosperous compared with less prosperous regions. Thirdly, we argue that policies to\nraise new firm formation in areas with low rates could lead to zero or even negative net\n3 Examples include hairdressing, beauticians, taxi driving, deliveries, window cleaners, car repairs etc.\n9employment creation over the three phases. A brief overview of the policy context in\nGreat Britain is now provided.\n3. Policy context\nGreene et al. (2004) identify four separate SME \/ Enterprise policy periods. The first is\nthe 1970s when GB enterprise policy \u2013 defined as providing assistance and support for\nnew and small firms \u2013 hardly existed. The 1970s is therefore viewed as a \u201cpolicy off\u201d\nperiod.\nThe arrival of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1979 changed matters radically.\nShe saw enterprise creation as highly desirable in itself, but also as a direct mechanism\nfor lowering unemployment levels. The 1980s can therefore be considered as a decade\ncharacterised by support for new start-up businesses.\nThe 1990s saw a shift in this policy, away from new firms and towards providing\nsupport for existing small firms with growth potential (for reasons underlying this shift,\nsee Greene et al., 2004). For GB as a whole therefore, the mid to late 1990s sees\nconsiderably less emphasis placed by policy makers upon new firms. The 1990s can\ntherefore be viewed as a decade in which the focus was on smaller firms with growth\npotential. Finally, following the election of a Labour government in 1997, the decade of\n2000 sees a further change, with policies being focussed more specifically on seeking to\nenhance productivity and increase social inclusion. In this period, both some types of\nnew firms and some types of growing firms are supported.4\n4 These policies were formalised in Small Business Service (2004). This identified the so-called seven\npillars: building an enterprise culture, encouraging a dynamic start up market, building the capability for\nsmall business growth, improving access to finance for small businesses, encouraging more enterprise in\ndisadvantaged communities and under-represented groups, improving small businesses\u2019 experience of\ngovernment services and developing better regulation and policy\n10\nWhilst these policies were being implemented in Great Britain \u2013 and specifically in\nEngland \u2013 different policies were being adopted in Scotland in the 1990s, and Wales\nfrom 20015. At a time when English policies focussed upon growth businesses, Scottish\npolicy makers became concerned that their new firm formation was much lower than\nthat of England. To address this, Scotland launched its Business Birth Rate Policy in\n1993. This programme cost \u00a3140m over the period until 2002. Its task was to close the\ngap between new firm formation rates in Scotland and those of the rest of the UK by the\nend of the 1990s. In 2001 the policy was reviewed6 and it was concluded that it had\nfailed to reach its main target, although there had been a \u201csmall but systematic increase\nin the Scottish business birth rate\u201d. Following the review an overhaul took place, with\npolicy being less explicitly focussed on raising new firm formation. As Scotland was\nreviewing its business birth rate strategy in 2001, Wales was introducing its\nEntrepreneurial Action Plan (EAP), one component of which was to seek to raise the\nbusiness birth rate in that country.\nIn short, GB enterprise policy has changed on a number of occasions over the past two\ndecades, with the 1980s being the decade in which it was most explicitly focussed on\nraising new firm formation. However Scotland in the 1990s and Wales after 2001 both\nsought to raise aggregate formation rates at a time when England was placing less\nemphasis upon this approach.\n5 Northern Ireland is excluded from this review because, although it also had active and independent\nenterprise policies and so would have been of real interest, the data available does not cover Northern\nIreland.\n6 Fraser of Allander (2001)\n11\n4. Data sources\nThe basic data on new firm formation are shown in Figure II. It shows that over the\nperiod 1980 to 2003, new firm formation rates \u2013 measured as new VAT Registrations7\nper 10,000 inhabitants \u2013 are consistently lower in Wales and Scotland than in England.\nThe overall rate of Great Britain is very close to the England rate because England is the\nnumerically dominant country. On average about 90 percent of the VAT registration in\nGreat Britain take place in England. Wales counts for only about four percent of the\nregistrations and Scotland consequently for six percent. Figure II also shows that there\nis a similar pattern over time in England, Scotland and Wales, with new firm formation\nrates rising in all three countries at least until 1989, then falling until 1994-95 and\nsubsequently being broadly stable. Hence, although the new firm formation rates\nfluctuated over time, the distribution between the three countries is very constant over\nthe period 1980 to 2003. Finally, there is some support for policy impact at GB level\nduring the 1980s. This was the decade in which Thatcher policies focussed upon\nstimulating new firm formation, and it is also the decade in which formation rates are\nhighest in all three countries8.\nThe data on employment used is taken from the Census of Employment and, from 1995\nonwards, the Annual Employment Survey. Data are supplied by Nomis with the self-\nemployed and unpaid family workers being excluded from the data. In examining the\nlagged relationship between new firm formation and employment we need to control for\n7 All businesses, other than those in exempt sectors, above a minimum sales threshold of \u00a361,000 [April\n2006] are required to be registered for VAT. Official statistics on new businesses are based on firms\nnewly registering with Revenue and Customs. The limitation of VAT data for our purposes is partly the\nexemptions but more the nature of the sales threshold. Given that many businesses will have annual sales\nof less than \u00a361,000 there will be undercounting. But, more important in our context, this undercounting\nis likely to be regionally biased. This is because low enterprise areas are likely to have lower prices of\ninputs and sales than in more prosperous areas for the reasons outlined in Section 2. However VAT\nregistrations are the basis for official statistics and have the key advantage of being available at a\ndisaggregated level since 1980. Whilst far from ideal, they are the best currently available.\n8 Our purpose here is not to provide a review of the issues relating to new firm formation at a regional\nlevel in the UK.

Different regional and sectoral\nclassifications in the original data files meant some linking operations were performed\nto ensure uniformity for 1980\u20132003 (see Van Stel and Storey, 2004 for details). The\nagricultural sector (also including forestry and fishing) is excluded as it is\nfundamentally different from the rest of the economy having, during this period,\nexceptionally low start-up and death rates.\n13\n5. Data analysis\nThe regions in England and the regions in Scotland and Wales show the same pattern\nregarding the correlation of new firm formation over time (Figure III). There is a strong\ncorrelation in the short term between start-up rates, but this correlation weakens over\ntime. Secondly, there is a strong variation over space, with some regions having only\nfour start-ups per 1000 employees and others more than 15 new businesses per 1000\nemployees. English regions generally have higher start-up rates than those in Wales or\nScotland.\nFigure III plots the correlation of new firm formation for two time periods. The first is\nthe relationship between start-ups in t and in t-1 and the second is between t and t-5. A\ndistinction is made between England on the one hand (Figure IIIa) and Scotland and\nWales on the other (Figure IIIb).\n2\n6\n10\n14\n18\n22\n2 6 10 14 18 22\n2\n6\n10\n14\n18\n22\n2 6 10 14 18 22\nNew firm formation rate in t New firm formation rate in t\nN\new\nfir\nm\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\nra\nte\nin\nt-1\nN\new\nfir\nm\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\nra\nte\nin\nt-5\nFigure IIIa: Correlation of new firm formation rates over time in England (start-ups\nper 1,000 employees)\n14\n2\n6\n10\n14\n18\n22\n2 6 10 14 18 22\n2\n6\n10\n14\n18\n22\n2 6 10 14 18 22\nNew firm formation rate in t New firm formation rate in t\nN\new\nfir\nm\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\nra\nte\nin\nt-1\nN\new\nfir\nm\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\nra\nte\nin\nt-5\nN\new\nfir\nm\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\nra\nte\nin\nt-1\nN\new\nfir\nm\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\nra\nte\nin\nt-5\nFigure IIIb: Correlation of new firm formation rates over time in Wales and Scotland\n(start-ups per 1,000 employees)\nTable I shows the persistency of new firm formation over time at the regional level.\nThe start-up rate in period t heavily depends on the start-up rate in the previous year and\nis also significantly determined by new firm formation activity five, ten and 15 years\npreviously.

Formally modelling the time lags\nTo formally address the issue of time-lags, the first step is to estimate a model relating\nemployment change over a two year period (between t and t+2) to start-up rates in year t\nand each of the preceding eight years.\n(i) Great Britain: The results for Great Britain as a whole are shown in Table II. We\nalso include measures of population density, wages, lagged employment change9 and a\nterm to address spatial auto correlation (see e.g. Keeble et al., 1993 or Anselin, 1988).\nThe results are also illustrated graphically in Figure IV. The smoothed line obtained in\nFigure IV is drawn on the basis of the so-called restricted parameters in Table II. These\nrestrictions are necessary because the initial regression suffers from multicollinearity\ncaused by the high correlations over time of the start-up rates (see Table I). These\nproblems of multicollinearity are avoided using the Almon lag method10. Basically this\nmethod imposes restrictions on the parameters of the start-up rates in such a way that\nthe estimated coefficients of the start-up rates are a function of the lag length.\nSubstituting these restrictions back in the original equation produces a more compact\nmodel that overcomes the problems of multicollinearity.\nIt is clear from Table II, using both a fixed effects model and a Huber-White Robust\nModel, that there are three different impacts.11 The initial effect is positive in year t but\nbecomes negative in t-1 and is significantly negative in t-3. Both models show that, in\nyear t-6, effects become significantly positive. Graphically this may be seen by\n9 This variable is included to control for the reversed causality issue discussed in the introduction (see\nalso Granger, 1969).\n10 Stewart (1991, 180-182) provides a general description of the Almon method.\n11 As the fixed effects method effectively considers the effects over time only, and the purpose of our\npaper is to explicitly examine the short and long run effects over time, we mainly focus on the fixed\neffects results in our discussion. However, the Huber White results are useful for robustness test purposes.\n16\ncomparing the areas under and above the horizontal line. The area below the horizontal\nline in Figure IV can be considered as the negative employment effects of new firm\nformation. The positive effects are shown above the horizontal line \u2013 the period of up\nto year 1 and the period from year 4 to year 8. The net effects which are positive for\nGreat Britain are clearly shown in Figure IV and strong evidence that the Mueller\nFritsch model for Germany is also valid for Great Britain12.\n12 One of our anonymous referees wondered whether this was a GB effect or simply a London effect. We\nre-ran the equations and found that the exclusion of London had only a very marginal effect on the\ncoefficients and their significance.\n17\nTable II: Long-term effects of new firm formation activity on employment change:\nGreat Britain\nTwo-year regional employment change (%)\nFixed effect estimator OLS estimator (Huber White)\nun-restricted 3rd order polynomial un-restricted 3rd order polynomial\nStart-up rate (t) 0.881**\n(3.81)\n0.828 0.732**\n(4.36)\n0.678\nStart-up rate (t-1) -0.492\n(1.78)\n-0.205 -0.529**\n(2.78)\n-0.267\nStart-up rate (t-2) 0.027\n(0.10)\n-0.569 -0.083\n(0.48)\n-0.576\nStart-up rate (t-3) -0.878**\n(3.24)\n-0.468 -0.823**\n(3.73)\n-0.451\nStart-up rate (t-4) -0.206\n(0.75)\n-0.111 -0.141\n(0.54)\n-0.089\nStart-up rate (t-5) 0.508\n(1.83)\n0.297 0.499\n(1.82)\n0.308\nStart-up rate (t-6) 0.732**\n(2.66)\n0.549 0.729**\n(2.82)\n0.542\nStart-up rate (t-7) -0.026\n(0.10)\n0.440 -0.105\n(0.46)\n0.412\nStart-up rate (t-8) 0.041\n(0.22)\n-0.238 0.009\n(0.05)\n-0.281\nPopulation density 0.005\n(0.54)\n0.006\n(0.60)\n-0.001**\n(4.37)\n-0.001**\n(4.37)\nHourly wages\n(constant prices)\n1.108**\n(2.64)\n1.072**\n(2.57)\n0.546**\n(3.51)\n0.558**\n(3.74)\n2-year employ-ment\nchange (t-2)\n-0.333**\n(9.35)\n-0.326**\n(9.44)\n-0.259**\n(5.88)\n-0.257**\n(5.99)\nSpatial autocorrelation 0.590**\n(8.88)\n0.568**\n(8.54)\n0.542**\n(6.62)\n0.524**\n(6.54)\nConstant 14.257*\n(2.12)\n-13.716*\n(2.04)\n-3.700**\n(3.18)\n-3.725**\n(3.28)\nR\u00b2-adjusted 0.2946 0.2899 0.3167 0.3138\nF-Value 30.07 47.33 21.00 33.27\nLog-likelihood -2059.80 -2065.11 -2098.85 -2102.97\nObservations 767 767 767 767\n** significant at 1%-level; * significant at 5%-level.\nThe signs on the control variables imply a positive effect of hourly wages13 and spatial\nautocorrelation, and negative effects of lagged employment growth (indicating business\ncycle effects) and population density. This last variable is meant to control for regional\ncharacteristics such as housing prices, qualified labour, local demand, and knowledge.\nNote that the coefficient is not significant using the fixed effect estimator since regional\n13 This might be thought to be a counter intuitive finding since self employment theory (Parker, 2004)\nwould imply that individuals would move into self employment \u2013 business ownership \u2013 when wages fall.\nOn those grounds high wage regions might be expected to have low rates of new firm formation. Our\nview is that this is only the case ceteris paribus. Of greater significance are the other factors working in a\ncontrary direction such as access to finance and local demand.\n18\ndifferences which are time-persistent (such as population density) are already accounted\nfor in the fixed effect.14\n-0.9\n-0.6\n-0.3\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\nIm\npa\nct\nof\nne\nw\nfir\nm\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\non\nem\npl\noy\nm\nen\ntc\nha\nng\ne\nt t-1 t-2 t-3 t-4 t-5 t-6 t-7 t-8\nStart-up rate\nFigure IV: Impact of new firm formation on employment change for GB regions (fixed\neffects estimator)\n(ii) Comparing England with Wales and Scotland: Table III makes this comparison. It\nbegins by presenting the results for England, followed by those for Scotland and finally\nfor Wales. It uses an interaction dummy to indicate new firm formation rates in\nEngland compared with Scotland and Wales. The results are plotted in Figure V.\nUnsurprisingly given its size dominance, the results for England are very similar to the\nearlier results for Great Britain. Most importantly, in England, the net impact of new\nfirm formation on employment is positive. In particular, the impact of Phase III - the\ncompetitiveness phase \u2013 is larger than for Phase II \u2013 the displacement phase.\n14 When using fixed effects we realise that inclusion of a lagged dependent variable might lead to a bias in\nthe estimation results. However, comparing the coefficient for the lagged dependent of the FE regression\nwith that of the Huber White regression we see that these are very similar. Therefore we argue that this\nbias is, at the most, small. Because the effect of the lagged dependent is very significant we choose to\ninclude it in our model, despite the disadvantage mentioned.\n19\nMost importantly we find a striking difference between the results for England and\nScotland (Table III). Although the basic pattern of three phases is the same, Scotland\nshows almost no employment gain in the competitiveness phase. Instead it is\ncharacterised by a relatively larger Phase 1 and a longer negative Phase 2.15 This\nimplies that the characteristics of new firms in Scotland do differ sharply from those in\nEngland. Wales experiences a stronger crowding out effect and a lower induced effect\ncompared with England. Nevertheless, the employment effects over time in Wales are\nvery similar to the effects in England.\n15 We should be careful when interpreting the large positive Phase 1 for Scotland. Using data for the\nNetherlands, van Stel and Suddle (2007) demonstrate that there is a danger of overestimating the direct\neffect when applying the Almon method. This is due to reversed causality effects.\n20\nTable III: Long-term effects of new firm formation activity on employment change \u2013\nEngland vs. Scotland vs. Wales\nTwo-year regional employment change (%)\nFixed effects estimator OLS estimator (Huber White)\nun-restricted 3rd order polynomial un-restricted 3rd order polynomial\nEngland:\nStart-up rate (t) 0.954**\n(3.69)\n0.851 0.639**\n(3.32)\n0.600\nStart-up rate (t-1) -0.560\n(1.77)\n-0.184 -0.575**\n(2.78)\n-0.307\nStart-up rate (t-2) -0.031\n(0.10)\n-0.552 -0.192\n(1.00)\n-0.589\nStart-up rate (t-3) -0.601*\n(1.94)\n-0.456 -0.536*\n(2.36)\n-0.444\nStart-up rate (t-4) -0.308\n(0.98)\n-0.097 -0.264\n(0.97)\n-0.070\nStart-up rate (t-5) 0.357\n(1.12)\n0.322 0.364\n(1.43)\n0.336\nStart-up rate (t-6) 0.839**\n(2.59)\n0.597 0.796**\n(2.84)\n0.575\nStart-up rate (t-7) 0.358\n(1.13)\n0.529 0.291\n(1.08)\n0.449\nStart-up rate (t-8) -0.073\n(0.34)\n-0.087 -0.211\n(1.15)\n-0.239\nWales:\nStart-up rate (t) 1.270\n(1.39)\n0.966 1.556\n(1.86)\n0.928\nStart-up rate (t-1) -0.808\n(0.74)\n-0.298 -0.859\n(0.89)\n-0.199\nStart-up rate (t-2) 0.031\n(0.03)\n-0.726 -0.210\n(0.40)\n-0.605\nStart-up rate (t-3) -1.106\n(1.06)\n-0.589 -0.997\n(1.17)\n-0.513\nStart-up rate (t-4) -0.448\n(0.41)\n-0.157 0.370\n(0.79)\n-0.145\nStart-up rate (t-5) 0.781\n(0.66)\n0.299 1.117\n(1.21)\n0.276\nStart-up rate (t-6) 1.273\n(1.12)\n0.510 1.042\n(1.53)\n0.528\nStart-up rate (t-7) -1.524*\n(1.46)\n0.205 -1.804\n(1.51)\n0.388\nStart-up rate (t-8) 0.138\n(0.20)\n-0.886 0.878\n(1.35)\n-0.366\nScotland:\nStart-up rate (t) 1.503**\n(2.73)\n1.330 1.400**\n(3.38)\n1.138\nStart-up rate (t-1) 0.139\n(0.20)\n0.287 -0.045\n(0.08)\n0.228\nStart-up rate (t-2) 0.329\n(0.47)\n-0.233 0.273\n(0.49)\n-0.230\nStart-up rate (t-3) -1.836**\n(2.61)\n-0.372 -1.821**\n(3.29)\n-0.355\nStart-up rate (t-4) 0.383\n(0.55)\n-0.269 0.623\n(0.81)\n-0.265\nStart-up rate (t-5) 0.830\n(1.24)\n-0.065 0.656\n(0.76)\n-0.079\nStart-up rate (t-6) 0.044\n(0.07)\n0.101 0.107\n(0.20)\n0.086\nStart-up rate (t-7) -1.238*\n(2.06)\n0.088 -1.393*\n(2.49)\n0.111\nStart-up rate (t-8) 0.469\n(0.86)\n-0.243 0.736\n(1.85)\n-0.121\nPopulation density 0.002\n(0.17)\n0.002\n(0.22)\n-0.001**\n(3.96)\n-0.001**\n(4.06)\nHourly wages (constant\nprices)\n1.452**\n(3.37)\n1.332**\n(3.13)\n0.554**\n(3.80)\n0.553**\n(3.90)\n2-year employment\nchange (t-2)\n-0.339**\n(9.27)\n-0.345**\n(9.86)\n-0.261**\n(6.05)\n-0.272**\n(6.29)\nSpatial autocorrelation 0.533**\n(7.64)\n0.520**\n(7.57)\n0.485**\n(4.95)\n0.486**\n(5.34)\nConstant -17.332*\n(2.53)\n-16.209*\n(2.37)\n-4.202**\n(3.44)\n-4.136**\n(3.42)\nR\u00b2-adjusted 0.3065 0.3020 0.3268 0.3227\nF-Value 13.79 25.34 -- 26.17\nLog-likelihood -2043.19 -2054.08 -2083.87 -2093.94\nObservations 767 767 767 767\n** significant at 1%-level; * significant at 5%-level.\n21\nThe results point to clear differences between England and Scotland, but much smaller\ndifferences between England and Wales.

We\nargued that this is related to the differences in start-up rates, i.e. on average relatively\nhigh start-up rates in England and lower rates in Wales and Scotland (see Figure II).\n16 There are two cases. First, there are the basic (unrestricted) estimations. In terms of the LR test the log\nlikelihood value for the unrestricted model is -2043.19 and that of the restricted model (i.e. \u2018restricting\u2019\nthe effects of England, Scotland and Wales to be the same) -2059.80. The corresponding LR test statistic\nthus equals 33.22. The critical value of the chi-squared distribution with 18 degrees of freedom (there are\n18 restrictions corresponding to the 18 interaction dummies) is 28.87 at the 5% significance level. Hence\nthe null hypothesis of valid restrictions is rejected. Second, there are the restricted (3rd order polynomial)\nestimations. Here the test statistic amounts to a value of 22.06 and the critical value is 15.51 since there\nare eight restrictions corresponding to the eight additional polynomial terms for Scotland and Wales.\nAgain, the null hypothesis is rejected.\n22\nWhilst it is valid to distinguish England from Scotland and Wales since they are\ndifferent countries and they have adopted different enterprise policies at different points\nin time, all three are part of Great Britain. Of even greater significance from the\nviewpoint of this paper, it would be incorrect to simply categorise England as having\nhigh rates of new firm formation and Wales and Scotland as having low rates. If our\npurpose is to compare employment in high and low new firm formation areas then these\nhave to be more clearly specified.\nFor this purpose regions are now re-classified as low entrepreneurial if they belong to\nthe lower 25 percentile in terms of their average start-up rate. Fifteen regions are\nclassified as low entrepreneurial. Six of the 15 regions are located in England, three of\nwhich are in the North East: Former County of Cleveland, Former County of Durham,\nTyne and Wear Metropolitan County, Cumbria County, Merseyside Metropolitan\nCounty, South Yorkshire Metropolitan County. West Glamorgan in Wales and 8\nScottish regions (Central, Dumfries and Galloway, Fife, Grampian, Highland, Lothian,\nStrathclyde, and Tayside) are also classified as low entrepreneurial. Although the low\nentrepreneurial regions seem to experience a strong direct effect they are characterised\nby a large displacement effect which lasts much longer compared with the highest 75%\nof regions in terms of start-up activity in Great Britain (Table IV and Figure VI).\nFurthermore these regions have a very low inductive effect which is also much shorter\nin time. The results clearly indicate a negative net effect for low entrepreneurial areas.\nAgain, comparing log likelihood values from Tables II and IV, we can formally test\nwhether the low entrepreneurial areas differ from the other areas. The LR test statistics\nfor the two cases identified above (see note 16) are now 30.8 and 26.0. This indicates\nthat the differences are statistically significant at the 1%-level.\n23\nTable IV: Long-term effects of new firm formation activity on employment change \u2013\nlow entrepreneurial areas\nTwo-year regional employment change (%)\nFixed effects estimator OLS estimator (Huber White)\nun-restricted 3rd order polynomial un-restricted 3rd order polynomial\nControl group (>25\npercentile):\nStart-up rate (t) 0.751**\n(3.02)\n0.718 0.537**\n(2.93)\n0.540\nStart-up rate (t-1) -0.521\n(1.72)\n-0.211 -0.551**\n(2.87)\n-0.298\nStart-up rate (t-2) 0.105\n(0.35)\n-0.524 0.005\n(0.03)\n-0.547\nStart-up rate (t-3) -0.710*\n(2.36)\n-0.412 -0.665**\n(2.61)\n-0.397\nStart-up rate (t-4) -0.432\n(1.42)\n-0.066 -0.383\n(1.69)\n-0.038\nStart-up rate (t-5) 0.798**\n(2.58)\n0.321 0.799**\n(2.75)\n0.340\nStart-up rate (t-6) 0.590*\n(1.89)\n0.560 0.568*\n(1.84)\n0.547\nStart-up rate (t-7) 0.054\n(0.18)\n0.459 0.006\n(0.02)\n0.395\nStart-up rate (t-8) 0.086\n(0.41)\n-0.174 -0.086\n(0.41)\n-0.308\nLow entrepreneurial\nareas (<=25\npercentile)\nStart-up rate (t) 1.354**\n(2.72)\n1.452 1.756**\n(5.06)\n1.557\nStart-up rate (t-1) -0.117\n(0.18)\n-0.295 -0.233\n(0.39)\n-0.064\nStart-up rate (t-2) -0.429\n(0.71)\n-0.895 -0.483\n(1.12)\n-0.774\nStart-up rate (t-3) -1.856**\n(3.10)\n-0.901 -1.749**\n(4.11)\n-0.825\nStart-up rate (t-4) 0.272\n(0.46)\n-0.505 0.538\n(0.84)\n-0.472\nStart-up rate (t-5) -0.420\n(0.71)\n0.011 -0.415\n(0.84)\n0.034\nStart-up rate (t-6) 0.943\n(1.67)\n0.365 0.975\n(1.83)\n0.438\nStart-up rate (t-7) -0.436\n(0.76)\n0.275 -0.530\n(0.93)\n0.488\nStart-up rate (t-8) -0.163\n(0.37)\n-0.541 0.493\n(1.62)\n-0.068\nPopulation density 0.010\n(0.97)\n0.011\n(1.04)\n-0.001**\n(4.43)\n-0.001**\n(4.60)\nHourly wages\n(constant prices)\n1.003*\n(2.36)\n0.958*\n(2.27)\n0.566**\n(3.72)\n0.573**\n(3.90)\n2-year employment\nchange (t-2)\n-0.350**\n(9.75)\n-0.343**\n(9.93)\n-0.266**\n(6.04)\n-0.264**\n(6.23)\nSpatial autocorrelation 0.558**\n(7.96)\n0.533**\n(7.64)\n0.510**\n(5.42)\n0.496**\n(5.47)\nConstant -14.173*\n(2.13)\n-13.633*\n(2.05)\n-3.659**\n(2.92)\n-3.569**\n(2.85)\nR\u00b2-adj. adjusted 0.3135 0.3096 0.3274 0.3247\nF-Value 19.54 34.46 33.28 38.27\nLog-likelihood -2044.38 -2052.10 -2088.14 -2094.80\nObservations 767 767 767 767\n** significant at 1%-level; * significant at 5%-level.\n24\nLow entrepreneurial regions\nOther regions\n-1.2\n-0.9\n-0.6\n-0.3\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n1.2\n1.5\nIm\npa\nct\nof\nne\nw\nfir\nm\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\non\nem\npl\noy\nm\nen\ntc\nha\nng\ne\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nLag (year)\nIm\npa\nct\nof\nne\nw\nfir\nm\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn\non\nem\npl\noy\nm\nen\ntc\nha\nng\ne\nFigure VI: Impact of new firm formation on employment change in low entrepreneurial\nareas\n7. Implications\nThis paper has examined whether it is possible to have \u201cthe wrong type of\nentrepreneurship\u201d \u2013 defined as new firm formation that leads to zero or even negative\nsubsequent employment.\nIn order to address this issue our paper uses a very similar approach to that of Fritsch\nand Mueller (2004) confirming their findings that the employment impact of new firm\nformation is in three discrete phases. The first and immediate impact is in terms of job\ncreation, a second impact which is negative in terms of entrants displacing inefficient\nincumbent firms, and a third impact in terms of enhanced competitiveness. The full\neffects of this impact are felt over a decade.\nWhere the paper moves forward the work of Fritsch and Mueller is to emphasise that\nthe impact on employment of new firm formation varies spatially within Great Britain.\nIt shows both informally by presenting pictures and formally by applying statistical\ntests, that the employment impact is significantly greater in England \u2013 a country with\n25\nhigh rates of new firm formation, than it is in Wales and Scotland, which have lower\nrates of new firm formation.\nIts second striking finding is that when the low enterprise counties (which are mostly\nbut not exclusively located in the north of England and Scotland) as a group are\ncompared with the rest of GB we find that the impact of new firm formation in these\nlow enterprise areas is overall negative. This means that the \u201cwrong type of\nentrepreneurship\u201d is indeed possible since raising the rates of new firm formation \u2013\npresumably by public policy measures \u2013 would lead to reduced employment.\nThese results have serious implications for policy makers who, we have noted\nthroughout this paper, have sought to raise new firm formation rates in the expectation\nthat this would lead subsequently to employment creation.\nOur first finding is that in some locations increases in new firm formation do indeed\nlead subsequently to new employment, but in other cases they do not. Our second result\nis that the impact on employment is greatest in the prosperous areas and least in the least\nprosperous areas. This implies that national enterprise policies risk being regionally\nregressive.\nOur second result might be acceptable if it could be shown that in all areas the\nemployment impact was positive, but this is not the case. We show that, for regions in\nthe lower 25 percentile of Great Britain in terms of average start-up rate, new firm\nformation is associated with reduced employment. Eight out of nine Scottish regions in\nour data base belong to these \u2018low enterprise\u2019 regions, hence it is questionable whether\nthe expenditure of \u00a3140m of taxpayers\u2019 funds over nine years in Scotland has been\nproductive. As we outlined in Section 2, we attribute the negative effect in low\nenterprise regions to the firms in these locations being started by individuals with few\n26\nemployment options, low personal skills and poor market prospects, but incentivised by\nthe availability of public money being made available to those wishing to be\nenterprising.\nReferences\nAnselin, Luc, 1988, Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models, Dordrecht: Kluwer\nAcademic Publishers.\nAnyadike-Danes, Michael, Mark Hart and Maureen O\u2019Reilly, 2005, \u2018Watch That Space!\nThe County Hierarchy in Firm Births and Deaths in the UK, 1980-1999\u2019, Small\nBusiness Economics 25(3), 273-292.\nDisney, Richard, Jonathan Haskel and Ylva Heden, 2003, \u2018Restructuring and\nProductivity Growth in UK Manufacturing\u2019, Economic Journal 113(489), 666-694.\nFraser of Allander Institute, 2001, Promoting Business Start ups: A New Strategic\nFormula, Glasgow, UK: University of Strathclyde.\nFritsch, Michael and Pamela Mueller, 2004, \u2018The Effects of New Business Formation\non Regional Development Over Time\u2019, Regional Studies 38(8), 961-976.\nGranger, Clive, 1969, Investigating Causal Relations by Econometric Models and\nCross-Spectral Methods, Econometrica 37, 424-438.\nGreene, Francis, Kevin Mole and David Storey, 2004, \u2018Does More Mean Worse?
