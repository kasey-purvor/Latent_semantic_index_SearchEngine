Recent works show that Turing model is involved in the initial induc-\ntion of hair and feather primordia (Maini, PK, Baker, RE, Chuong, CM., 2006. The Turing model\ncomes of molecular age. Science. 314:1397-1398). Reaction diffusion mechanism converts stem\ncells from the basal homogeneous status to chemical patterns, reflecting activator and inhibitor\nactivities. How the Turing pattern is then translated to discrete cellular patterns remains unknown.\nUsing the feather model, here we show ERK activity-dependent mesenchymal cell chemotaxis\ntoward initial peaks is essential for completing pattern formation. Adding ERK inhibitors produced\na spectrum of placode patterns, ranging from broad stripes (early addition) to spots (late addition).\nStripe regions exhibit broadly Shh-positive epithelium and NCAM-positive mesenchyme, implying\na status intermediate to the basal and feather bud states. We propose that periodic patterning occurs\nin a restrictive mode; first a reaction-diffusion mechanism converts the homogeneous stem cell field\ninto patterned regions of pre-primordia. Then cells respond to FGF and other signals by moving\ntoward pre-primordia and also shape the patterning process, until large discrete dermal conden-\nsations are established. We developed a mathematical model integrating experimental data and\nsimulating this patterning process.\n932\nHuman hair follicles are direct targets for thyroid hormones: involvement in anagen pro-\nlongation, hair matrix proliferation, hair pigmentation and metabolism\nN van Beek,1 E Bodo,1 A Kromminga,2 E G\u00e1sp\u00e1r,1,4 K Meyer,1 MA Zmijewski,3 A Slominski,3\nBE Wenzel4 and R Paus1 1 Dept. of Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany, 2\nInstitute for Immunology, Clinical Pathology, Molecular Medicine, Hamburg, Germany, 3\nDept. of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN and 4\nCell and Immunobiology Laboratory, Dep. of Med. I., University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany\nBoth insufficient and excess levels of thyroid hormones (THs:T3, T4) can result in altered hair\/skin\nstructure and function (e.g. effluvium). However, it is still unclear whether THs exert any direct\neffects on human hair follicles (HFs). Studying microdissected, organ-cultured human scalp HFs,\nwe show here that T4 up-regulates the proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes, while their apop-\ntosis is downregulated by THs. The latter also prolong anagen duration in vitro possibly due to the\ndown-regulation of the key anagen inhibitory factor, TGF\u03b22. Human HFs transcribe deiodinases\nand should thus be capable of converting T4 to T3 and of inactivating T3. Immunoreactivity (IR) for\nthe thyroid hormone-responsive keratins CK6 and CK14 is significantly modulated by THs (CK6:\nenhanced, CK14: down-regulated) and significantly stimulate intrafollicular melanin synthesis.\nSince THs can stimulate erythropoietin (EPO) expression and human scalp HFs are an extrarenal\nEPO source, we also assessed whether THs increase intrafollicular EPO expression. Both erythro-\npoietin mRNA expression and immunreactivity were significantly increased by THs. Furthermore,\nTHs upregulate intraepithelial HF IR for a key respiratory chain enzyme, cytochrome- c- oxidase\nI, suggesting the possible involvement of thyroid hormones in HF metabolism. We identify further\nthyroid hormone target in the HF connective tissue sheath: thyroid hormones activate (increase\nnumber and degranulation) mast cells. Thus, human HFs are direct targets of thyroid hormone,\nwhich modulate multiple different HF functions, ranging from HF cycling to pigmentation.\n933\nReversal of epidermal aging by NF-\u03baB blockade\nAS Adler,1 TL Kawahara,1 JY Zhang,3 E Segal,2 KF Chua4 and HY Chang1 1 Program in Epithelial\nBiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 2 Computer Science, Weizmann Institute,\nRehovot, Israel, 3 Dermatology, Duke University, Durham, NC and 4 Medicine, Stanford\nUniversity, Stanford, CA\nAging is associated with subtle yet widespread alterations in gene expression, but the mechanisms\ncontrolling these alterations are not well understood. By identifying combinations of cis-regula-\ntory elements that are predictive of expression patterns in individuals of different ages, we predicted\nthat the transcription factor NF-\u03baB is a major regulator of gene expression changes associated with\naging in many human and murine tissues. Inducible genetic blockade of NF-\u03baB in the epidermis\nof chronologically aged mice substantially reverted the global gene expression program and tissue\ncharacteristics to those of young mice. We further show that a classic mouse mutant of premature\naging is due to excessive NF-\u03baB activation. These results suggest that NF-\u03baB activity is required for\nenforcing many characteristics of aging, especially in skin.\n934\nWnt modulates the differentiation status of interfollicular epidermal melanocytes arising\nfrom melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle bulge after wounding or UVB irradiation\nM Ito, J Nguyen, P Myung, L Garza, T Andl, S Millar and G Cotsarelis Dermatology, University\nof Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA\nMelanocyte stem cells residing in the hair follicle bulge area are ultimately responsible for pig-\nmentation of the hair. However, it is unknown whether bulge melanocytes contribute to pigmen-\ntation of the interfollicular epidermis. To study whether melanocyte stem cells located in the bulge\nmigrate to the interfollicular epidermis after injury or UVB irradiation, we utilized Trp2-lacZ trans-\ngenic reporter mice that express LacZ in melanocytes. We found that melanocytes originally located\nin the hair follicle bulge migrated to the infundibulum and then epidermis where they remained\nfor at least 4 months. The bulge- derived melanocytes in the epidermis were well-differentiated\nand produced melanin. Using transgenic mice (tet-O-dkk1\/K5-rtTA) in which Dkk1, a potent inhibitor\nof Wnt signaling, was over-expressed in the basal epidermis, we found that Wnt signaling regu-\nlated melanocyte stem cell differentiation during their migration to the epidermis. Dkk1 over- expres-\nsion in the epidermis during reepithelialization resulted in a dramatic down- regulation of melanocyte\ndifferentiation markers such as tyrosinase, although it did not significantly change the number of\nmelanocytes in the wound epidermis. Cessation of Dkk1 induction after reepithelialization per-\nmitted hair follicle neogenesis and the bulge-derived melanocytes then exhibited the capacity to\nregenerate the de novo pigmentary unit in the new hair follicles. These findings indicate that\nmelanocyte stem cells residing in the hair follicle bulge have the ability to give rise to durable epi-\ndermal melanocytes and that wnt signaling modulates melanocyte stem cell differentiation status.\n935\nLaminin-511 is an early epithelial message promoting dermal papilla development and func-\ntion during early hair morphogenesis\nJ Gao,1 M DeRouen,1 C Chen,1 M Nguyen,1 N Nguyen,1 H Ido,2 K Harada,2 K Sekiguchi,2\nB Morgan,3 J Miner,4 A Oro1 and P Marinkovich1 1 Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA, 2 Osaka Univ,\nOsaka, Japan, 3 Harvard Univ, Boston, MA and 4 Washington Univ, St. Louis, MO\nHair morphogenesis takes place through reciprocal epithelial and mesenchymal signaling, how-\never the mechanisms controlling signal exchange are poorly understood. Laminins are extracellu-\nlar matrix proteins that play critical roles in both adhesion and signaling. We have previously shown\nthat laminin-511 is required for hair morphogenesis and here we elucidate the underlying mech-\nanism. Although we showed that endogenous laminin-511 in hair morphogenesis was produced\nby epithelium, surprisingly we found that it was dermal papillae (DP), in the absence of laminin-\n511 (in lama5-\/- skin), which displayed several key developmental defects by E16.5 including a\nfailure to maintain expression of the key morphogen noggin. This maintenance was critical as it\ncoincided with an abrupt arrest of hair follicle downgrowth ultimately resulting in complete hair\ninvolution of lama5-\/- skin. Exogenous introduction of purified laminin-511, noggin or the down-\nstream noggin effector Sonic hedgehog (Shh), was sufficient to restore hair follicle development in\nlama5-\/- skin. Laminin-511 with a deleted heparin binding domain supported noggin production\nand hair follicle development after application to lama5-\/- skin, however laminin-511 lacking the\nintegrin binding site or wild type laminin-111 showed no hair promoting effects. Previous studies\nhave shown that Shh signaling requires microtubule based signaling organelles termed primary\ncilia. Interestingly, mutant lama5-\/- DP showed a striking decrease in primary cilia length and struc-\nture, both in vitro and in vivo. Laminin-511, but not laminin-111, restored primary cilia formation\nin lama5-\/- DP and dramatically triggered noggin expression in E16.5 mouse dermal mesenchyme\nin an Shh and PDGF dependent manner. These studies show that epithelial-derived laminin-511 is\na critical early signal which directs DP ciliary function and maintenance as a requirement for hair\nfollicle development.\n936\nCanonical Wnt signaling activity is required for Hedgehog pathway-induced epithelial bud\nand follicular hamartoma development\nSH Yang,1 V Grachtchouk,1 T Andl,2 A Wang,1 J Liu,1 L Syu,1 J Ferris,1 A Glick,3 S Millar2 and\nA Dlugosz1 1 Dermatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 2 Dermatology and Cell\nand Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA and 3 CMTC, Penn\nState University, University Park, PA\nAberrant Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a critical role in the development of several undifferenti-\nated tumors arising in skin, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and basaloid follicular hamar-\ntoma. Although these tumors are considered to be of follicular origin, the identity and location\n(follicular versus interfollicular epidermis) of tumor progenitor cells have not been firmly estab-\nlished. Superficial BCCs frequently exhibit buds of proliferating basal cells growing directly from\nthe epidermis into the underlying dermis, strongly resembling embryonic hair germs which are ini-\ntiated by canonical Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling. We investigated the potential involvement of canon-\nical Wnt signaling in epithelial bud development in early human BCCs and a mouse model of dereg-\nulated Hh signaling, driven by an activated Hh pathway effector, SMO*. Similar to embryonic hair\ngerms, human BCC buds exhibited elevated levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin, a marker\nof canonical Wnt signaling, and expressed early hair follicle lineage markers, including Sox9,\nK17, and CDP. Analogous changes were detected in BCC-like epithelial buds and follicular hamar-\ntomas arising in SMO* mice, along with expression of multiple Wnt genes, Tcf4, the Wnt target\ngene Axin2, and non-phosphorylated (active) \u03b2-catenin. Furthermore, by selectively blocking canon-\nical Wnt signaling with Dkk1, we dramatically inhibited epithelial bud and hamartoma develop-\nment in SMO* mice, despite continued, uncontrolled Hh signaling. Our findings reveal an essen-\ntial function for Wnt signaling downstream of pathologic Hh signaling in skin, help elucidate how\n\u2018follicular\u2019 tumors can arise from interfollicular epidermis, and provide a molecular explanation\nfor the morphological and biochemical similarity between BCC buds and hair germs.\nS156 Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2008), Volume 128\n"}
