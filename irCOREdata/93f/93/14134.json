They can\nbe categorized according to function (e.g. compare and contrast, problem and solu-\ntion) or form (e.g. spider map and tree diagram). Multiple representations, on the\nother hand, refer to different types of representations in terms of modality (visual,\naudio or textual) or number (more than one representation of the same type).\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore how knowledge of students\u2019 cognitive\nprocesses when using multiple organizers informs the teaching of writing. This paper\nwill present the writing process of poor writers and how graphic organizers scaffold\nthe process, before proceeding to review the use of multiple representations in learn-\ning and the methodological issues in the use of sequential graphic organizers in\nprocess writing.\n*Corresponding author.

Lee et al.\nCurrent perspectives on the use of organizers in the teaching of writing\nResearch on the writing process of poor writers shows that they do not have a sense of\npriority. Thus, they spend little time planning and begin writing although they are still\nconfused about the task (Zamel, 1983). They often lack a mental representation of what\nthey are writing as they cannot define their task well (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1986a),\nwhich leads them to practice knowledge-telling by writing whatever they could recall\nabout the topic without thinking about the structural coherence of their writing or any\nawareness of audience expectations. They do not have a sense of direction (Perl, 1979)\nwhen writing; hence, they use the trial-and-error approach to trigger further writing\n(Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1986b). They also have very inflexible plans (Richards, 1990),\nand do not possess systematic strategies to help them to generate enough content to\nwrite. Therefore they are unwilling to discard anything that might \u2018fit\u2019 into the topic.\nFinally, they tend to think that their lack of composing competence is due to their\nlimited language resources (Richards, 1990), and hence they focus on language issues.\nGraphic organizers have often been used to scaffold students\u2019 writing. Table 1\nshows how graphic organizers can help poor writers.\nDrawing graphic organizers may help students to plan their writing in the pre-\nwriting stage so that they will have a clear sense of direction when they write. Graphic\norganizers thus help students to identify what information they should look for, what\ninformation is missing and what information is redundant to their writing via visual\nrepresentation. In a tree diagram, for example, the order of the ideas can be seen\nclearly by looking at its location within the hierarchy.\nRecording notes from text and then reviewing them in an organizer reinforces learn-\ning as this allows students to access the information or input twice (once when they\nrecord the information into the graphic organizers, and the second time when they\nreview the information represented in their graphic organizers to write their essays).\nThis review also encourages students to re-examine their writing goals in the light of\ntheir task goal. Similarly, the visibility of the graphic organizers allows students to\nmanipulate the ideas in the graphic organizers. Students may be prompted to revise\nan idea that does not fit a cell in a matrix or be encouraged to look for further infor-\nmation due to highlighted gaps in their knowledge. Thus, they can get a clear sense\nof direction before writing begins.\nFlower and Hayes (1980) suggest that if students concentrate on language in the\ninitial stages of writing, this may truncate the flow of their thoughts. The use of\nTable 1. Graphic organizers to scaffold writing\nProblems in writing Benefits of using graphic organizers\nNo sense of priority Forced to fill in ideas and link them into an argument\nLack of mental representation, \nno sense of direction\nInformation is indexed by location, reviewing writing \ngoals while coding information in dual modalities\nInflexible plans Ideas are easily manipulated\nConcerned about language Focus on keywords, not sentence structure\nMethodological issues in using sequential representations 133\ngraphic organizers helps students to concentrate on meaning rather than form\n(sentences), as only keywords are used in the organizers. Students can also learn to\nwrite systematically as they translate the ideas from the organizer into their essays.\nPractice in writing with organizers may support students in developing richer proce-\ndural knowledge about writing. For example, Benton et al. (1993) found that writing\nnotes using a matrix helped students form a coherent overview of the subject, and\nstudents who wrote their essays from their notes were more organized and coherent\nin their writing. They also wrote lengthier essays.\nMultiple representations and learning\nThere are many advantages to using multiple representations. Mayer (1997) claims\nin his multimedia theory that students learn better from pictures and words rather\nthan learning from words alone. Two of the assumptions of his multimedia theory\nexplain that this is because working memory is more efficient if information is\nprocessed in dual channels as the working memory is limited in its processing capac-\nity. Additionally, he proposes, students need to be active participants in the learning\nprocess, selecting and organizing information into coherent representations. This is\nfacilitated by students having to recode information from one modality to another.\nSpiro et al.\u2019s (1992) cognitive flexibility theory also supports the use of multiple\nrepresentations to provide students with situation-sensitive knowledge that would\nprepare them for problem-solving transfer. Additionally, multiple representations\nprompt students to compare and contrast the various situations covered so that they\navoid reductive bias (premature conclusions based on prior knowledge).\nMayer (2001), however, highlights that there are competitive effects in the use of\nmultiple representations in his instructional design principles for multimedia. He\nfinds that multiple representations distract students from their focus of attention\nwhen there is too much redundant or extraneous information. For example, Mayer\nand Moreno\u2019s (1998) study found that students performed worse in the animation\n(visual), narration (audio) and on-screen text (visual) group than the animation\n(visual) and narration (audio) group. Although the information in the visual channel\nwas the same (and thus redundant) but in different forms, students still processed\nboth, which added to their cognitive load. Similarly, Moreno and Mayer (2000)\nfound that students who received the narration, background music and sounds treat-\nment fared the worst. Adding environmental sounds did not interfere with students\u2019\nunderstanding of the lightning process being narrated because the stimuli were rele-\nvant and coordinated with the narration. However, the background music interfered\nwith students\u2019 comprehension of what was being learnt because it was not relevant to\ntheir understanding.\nMayer\u2019s modality, redundancy and coherence principles are pro-active steps that\nthe teacher needs to take in structuring the task. However, they do not provide\nenough insights into the use of representations when they are generated by students\nfor sequential processes within a task in a classroom context. Ainsworth\u2019s (2006)\nconceptual framework for learning with multiple representations, however, expands\n134 C.-C. Lee et al.\non Mayer\u2019s principles, by recognizing the different functions of representations and\nthe cognitive tasks that students engage in when using them. Her framework has three\ncomponents: design, function and task.\nThe design parameters are number, form, information, sequence and translation.\nAinsworth (2006) suggests that the number of representations should be sufficient for\nthe task and not overwhelming. This is because the cognitive tasks involved in using\nthe representations are complex. In addition, students have to be familiar with the form\nof the representations to be able to select and construct them correctly. Furthermore,\nhow the representations are sequenced (concurrently or sequentially, and in what\norder) and the way the information is distributed between the representations may not\nbe clear to the students, thus leaving students confused about how to translate (coor-\ndinate and integrate information) between representations.\nShe also recommends that we should first identify the function of the representa-\ntions to see whether they are complementary, constraining or constructing when\nproviding support for processing. She explains that recognizing the functions of the\nrepresentations is important as it determines whether the representations have to be\nco-present when information is processed. If the representations have to be co-\npresent, this would involve a higher cognitive load.\nThe multiple representations complement each other when they differ in terms of\nthe processes each supports or the information contained. The constraining function\nhappens in two ways: when a familiar representation is introduced prior to an unfa-\nmiliar one so that students can learn by analogy, and by explicit illustration. Finally,\nmultiple representations have the constructing function when learners integrate infor-\nmation from the various representations introduced to construct new knowledge that\nwould be difficult to achieve with only one representation.\nAinsworth (2006) also highlights the complexity of the cognitive tasks students\nperform when using multiple representations, and thus advocates that students be\ntrained to understand, select and construct representations appropriate to the task.\nThe next section discusses how Ainsworth\u2019s model of design, function and cogni-\ntive tasks interplay with each other in the context of using multiple graphic organizers\nin process writing.\nMethodological issues in using sequential graphic organizers in writing\nProcess writing requires students to write multiple drafts based on feedback from their\npeers or teacher. The writing process could also be divided into three stages: catego-\nrizing and extracting, integrating information and drawing conclusions. Thus, for each\nstage, students are to write their drafts, comment on each others\u2019 drafts, and revise\ntheir drafts based on their peers\u2019 feedback and, finally, based on their teacher\u2019s feed-\nback. Peer feedback helps to provide students with a mental model of readers (Berg,\n1999), multiple perspectives of what is being learnt (van Boxtel et al., 2000) and\nexpand their understanding (Witbeck, 1976) so that students are clearer about any\nincongruity between their ideas and how their ideas are perceived by their audience.\nIn addition, feedback by the teacher helps to provide students with the motivation to\nMethodological issues in using sequential representations 135\nrevise in a multi-draft setting (Jacobs et al., 1998).What are the issues involved if these\ntextual drafts are replaced by \u2018organizer\u2019 drafts?\nNumber and sequence\nIn process writing, the organizers have a complementary function. Thus, the organiz-\ners are generated, commented and revised sequentially according to the purposes of\neach stage of the writing process.\nThis creates the split attention effect. To overcome this problem, Pollock et al.\n(2002) suggest that teachers should first isolate the interacting elements and then\nintroduce them simultaneously in order to lessen students\u2019 cognitive load. This is\nbecause as long as students do not have a basic schema in long-term memory, learn-\ning will be impeded because of the high cognitive load. In a class with students of\nmixed abilities in writing, the implication may mean that students should not be\nallowed to write their essays until they have their ideas represented in the organizers\ncoherently.\nSweller (2004), however, cautions that this strategy may have the expertise reversal\neffect on expert writers because if a \u2018knowledge-based central executive is already\navailable, an instruction-based version will be redundant and may interfere with addi-\ntional learning\u2019 (p. 25). Seufert\u2019s (2003) results also show that students with high prior\nknowledge do not seem to benefit from instruction using multiple representations. In\nfact, instruction interferes with their mental model construction. Mayer (1997) also\nagrees that students with high prior knowledge seem to be able to construct a mental\nmodel of the content studied just from text, without the aid of visuals.\nThus it may be better then to encourage students with high prior knowledge to use\norganizers with the constructing function, while students with low prior knowledge\nshould be introduced to organizers with constraining and complementary functions\nto support their learning.\nAn alternative would be for teachers to consider giving students the choice and flex-\nibility in the number of organizers that need to be generated, commented on and\nrevised. This means that teachers have to be selective as to which process they want\nto make compulsory for students to enjoy the benefits of process writing. It is\nsuggested that support for processing should be focused on the initial stages of writ-\ning; namely, the categorizing and extracting information process rather than the later\nstages. This is in line with Ferris\u2019s (1997) finding that students are most likely to\nrevise in the early stages of writing compared with later stages.\nForm\nSchnotz and Bannert (2003) find that inappropriate selection of representations may\nimpede students\u2019 mental model construction. Thus, training is important to enable\nstudents to understand, select and construct the organizers appropriate for the task.\nWinn (1993) states that students\u2019 knowledge of the content of the diagram lets\nstudents anticipate what to look for next and where to look for it.\n136 C.-C. Lee et al.\nGriffin et al. (1995) also agree that training is important in helping students opti-\nmize the features of the organizers. Their results show that, in the absence of explicit\ninstructions, the performance of the students is similar to rereading the text. This is\nbecause students are not able to relate the new information in the text to the existing\ninformation in the organizer (Kloster & Winne, 1989). Chmielewski and Dansereau\n(1998) further find that, with training, students are able to recall more macro-level\nideas than students not trained in the construction and use of the knowledge map.\nAinsworth (2006) and Cheng et al. (2001) further highlight that the computational\noffloading, re-representation and constraining properties of the representations\nshould all be considered, since different properties of the representations may have\ndifferent effects on students\u2019 elaboration. Students have to re-represent their ideas\nfrom one representation to another for the different stages in writing. In addition,\nstudents need to understand the relationship between the constrained and the\nconstraining representation if they are to translate between representations. The\ndifferent representations also offer different computational offloading properties, thus\ntriggering students to use different strategies when trying to understand them.\nAinsworth et al. (2002), for example, show that students use perceptual strategies\nwhen using pictorial representations but rule-based strategies when using mathemat-\nical representations.\nStark et al. (2002) suggest that elaboration training (ability to draw inferences from\nworked examples) should be given to help students improve the quality of their exam-\nple elaboration (in this context, students\u2019 revision). Their study shows that students\nwith elaboration training mostly used deep cognitive elaboration, which was also\nassociated with a tolerance for ambiguity, while students without elaboration training\nused superficial elaboration.\nInformation\nThe way information is distributed among the sequential organizers also affects\nstudents\u2019 processing. Ainsworth et al.\u2019s (2002) study found that students have diffi-\nculties translating between representations. Students in the pictorial and mathemati-\ncal condition (mixed) did not improve as compared with those given only one type of\nrepresentation. When the study was repeated, the mixed group improved as they\nlearnt to focus on the representation that contained all the relevant information and\nignore the other representation. This may mean that metacognitive instruction is\nimportant to raise students\u2019 awareness about the different purposes of each stage in\nthe writing process in the early stages of instruction. Sweller (2004) also agrees that\nexplanations should be given in the early stages. This will enable students to concen-\ntrate on generating, commenting and revising the content when using the organizers.\nTranslation\nStudents have difficulties translating between representations because of the form of\nthe representations and their processing strategies. Lowe (2003) reports that students\nMethodological issues in using sequential representations 137\nhave difficulties identifying conceptually significant information in static graphics as\nthey are not salient. Lewalter\u2019s (2003) study further shows that rehearsal strategies\n(memorizing and recapitulation) are the most frequently used strategies when\nstudents are studying static and dynamic visuals. Students very rarely use elaboration\nstrategies (building connections between new information and prior knowledge) and\ncontrol strategies (strategies to plan and regulate learning). This result is similar to\nPaulus\u2019 (1999) finding that students often engage in superficial revisions; namely,\nparaphrasing or rewording rather than meaning-level revisions.\nMayer and Sims\u2019s (1994) study also found that students with different spatial abil-\nities process information differently. Their results show that students with high spatial\nability are able to devote more cognitive resources to building referential connections\n(interacting connections) between visual and verbal representation, while students\nwith low spatial ability devote more cognitive resources to building representation\nconnections between visually presented material and its visual representation.\nThus, teachers should train students in giving peer review and revising following\nFaigley and Witte\u2019s (1981) taxonomy of revision changes in text and Stark et al.\u2019s\n(2002) coding system for elaboration behavior, so that they can see the type of\ncomments on which they have focused (Figure 1) and, on the part of the writers, the\ntype of revisions in which they have engaged (Figure 2). This is greatly facilitated by\norganizers that offer computational offloading, re-representation and constraining\nproperties which are hierarchical in nature (have a heading and sub-heading struc-\nture) as they help students see the focus of their changes.\nFigure 1.

Categorizations in parentheses refer to \ntype of comments\n138 C.-C. Lee et al.\nconsist of formal comments affecting the spelling of words. Text-base comments are\nbased on the location of the idea being commented on. If the comment concerns\na main idea, it is considered a macro comment. Addition macro comments add a\nmain idea into the organizer, while deletion macro comments delete a main idea from\nthe organizer. Substitution macro comments refer to comments where the peer\ndeletes the original main idea and substitutes another main idea in the same location.\nDistribution macro comments refer to instances where the peer may want to change\na main idea into a sub-idea of another main idea. Consolidation macro comments, on\nthe other hand, refer to instances where the peer combines two main ideas to form a\nnew main idea.\nStark et al.\u2019s (2002) coding system includes goal-operator comments and monitor-\ning elaboration. Goal-operator comments occur when students are out-of-topic or\nwhen their peers feel that the students\u2019 ideas do not meet the audience\u2019s needs and\npurpose of the writing task. Positive monitoring comments occur when the peers\naffirm that they understand what the students have written as it is presented well.\nNegative monitoring comments occur when the peers mention that they do not\nunderstand what the students are trying to present. This may be because the organiz-\ners are too brief. The same categorizations apply to micro-comments except that it is\nat the sub-idea level. Students\u2019 revisions can be similarly analyzed with the addition\nof one more category; that is, to ignore their peers\u2019 or teacher\u2019s comment at the macro\nor micro level of ideas.\nTable 2 outlines the proposed instructional approaches suitable for classes with\nstudents of different writing abilities in the order they should be introduced in the\nclassroom as gleaned from the discussion above.\nFigure 2.

Categorizations in parentheses \nrefer to type of revision made\nMethodological issues in using sequential representations 139\nImplications\nFour main implications arise from the above approaches for designers of concept\nmapping tools. Firstly, visual mapping software should have multiple-entry levels for\nusers with different writing abilities. Good writers should have the option to map the\nideas for the whole essay in one screen while poor writers should have the option to\nmap their ideas one stage at a time. A further option should be provided where\nstudents can choose to view ideas at certain hierarchies (e.g. top level and sub-idea\nlevel 1 for all the main points simultaneously to check for flow) or just focus on one\nmain idea with all its sub-ideas for further elaboration. Secondly, a small comment\nbox could be added to remind users of the purpose of each stage and how information\nis distributed among the different representations. This would help writers keep a\nmental blueprint of what they are doing and not be lost in the details. Thirdly, as\ndifferent organizers offer different computational offloading, re-representation and\nconstraining properties and students do have preferences regarding the organizers\nused (Lee, 2005), students need to be trained to select and construct appropriate\norganizers. Finally, training in peer review and example elaboration also needs to take\ninto account the \u2018inflexibility\u2019 and time taken to map ideas using software compared\nwith mapping ideas using pen and paper. In order to offset these disadvantages, it\nwould be advantageous if mapping software could provide a \u2018track changes\u2019 view that\ncould be enabled or disabled according to the students\u2019 choice. This view would label\nTable 2.

Lee et al.\nthe changes in terms of micro and macro changes; and also types of changes accord-\ning to Faigley and Witte\u2019s (1981) taxonomy of revision changes to motivate students\nto do meaning-level revisions rather than just paraphrasing ideas.\nConclusion\nThis paper has considered a specific application of Ainsworth\u2019s framework for the use\nof multiple representations in writing, by looking at how the knowledge of students\u2019\ndecisions with regards to the usage of graphic organizers generated sequentially\ninform the teaching of writing. From the literature review, we have proposed instruc-\ntional approaches for the use of multiple graphic organizers for classes with students\nof different writing abilities. Extended implications for designers of concept mapping\ntools based on these approaches have also been provided. It is hoped that these\ninsights will provide for further development of Ainsworth\u2019s framework for use in\nother contexts.\nReferences\nAinsworth, S.
