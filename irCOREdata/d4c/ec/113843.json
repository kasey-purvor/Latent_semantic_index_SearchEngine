While the term \u2018lateral\u2019 was originally encountered \nthrough de Bono (1967), its association in the research project embraces the kinds of \nthinking and making connected to elements of discovery that are tacit, experiential and \nheuristic in nature: ideation, visualization and intuition form other elements of a sphere of \npractice that are harder to contain and evidence within orthodox approaches to academic \nresearch in the Humanities. The research project\u2019s initial portrait of practice emerged \nfrom interviews with design students, designers\/tutors and young designers in Leeds and \nat the Royal College of Art, London. The second and more speculative stage of my \nresearch asks what might happen if such subject matter and such modes of practice are \nimposed on writing culture. In other words, could writing be enriched in some way by \ndesigning, thinking and making modes? Would it further reveal insights into practice \nrhythms? I therefore took the very broad practice of drawing and created a number of \n 2\nexperiments that moved from drawing responses to the themes above, to speaking and \nthen to writing activities.  \n \n \nThe research project itself interrogates the existing curriculum in proposing writing as \nsomething that can be conceived of as a by-product of drawing. The writing element in \nthe experiments may include, or move beyond, the requirement for an evaluative or \nreflective response; they may have a totally distinct, more expressive nature, or may even \nbe repressed, erased. These \u2018experiments\u2019 are so called rather than \u2018workshops\u2019 because \ntheir nature is essentially exploratory and open-ended; they are not designed to transmit a \nbody of skills, for example, or to progress through exercises. In fact, the experiments \nhave something of the spirit of CLTAD 2010 with Susan Orr\u2019s talk, \u2018Reflect on this!\u2019 \n(CLTAD 2010) in that there is a prioritizing of students\u2019 primary practice and mode of \nworking. Howard Riley\u2019s notion of the \u2018visual essay\u2019 (CLTAD 2010) has also taken up \nthis baton. Indeed, there are many echoes of the 2002\u20132006 national project,Writing \nPurposefully in Art and Design\u2019s forays here, for instance the imperative for writing to \nmatch the purpose of the student-practitioner rather than to resemble an inculcation into \nsomeone else\u2019s culture. Another element of the understanding behind the experiments is \nthat there are primary modes of thinking that are visual and that can be annexed in \nwriting perhaps. Rudolf Arnheim\u2019s book Visual Thinking (1969) emphasizes this \nelement: \n 3\n\u2018What makes language so valuable for thinking, then, cannot be thinking in words. It \nmust be the help that words lend to thinking while it operates in a more appropriate \nmedium, such as visual imagery. \nWords point to precepts \nThe visual medium is so enormously superior because it offers structural equivalents to \nall characteristics of objects, events, relations [\u2026]\u2019 \n \nTo some extent then, the experiments are concerned with what is primary and what is \nsecondary. The \u2018primary\u2019 in this project is connected with the drawing itself, visual \nexpression, with experience and with processes of practice, for example. These might \ninclude sketching out ideas \u2013 without preamble, deliberation or conscious planning. In \nother words, the powers of visualization and intuition or ideation are called upon. The \n\u2018secondary\u2019 are words, both the verbal chatting around the images and finally the writing.  \nWhile the research project is concerned with how writing is manifested after drawing and \ntalking, this brief article will focus solely on the practical details of the actual encounter \nthat formed the experiment \u2018Observation\u2019, and will offer up a few \u2018end notes\u2019 from the \nBerlin conference (CLTAD 2010). As Curtis Tappenden, the sole collaborator in this \nexperiment, illuminates, \n\u2018This is a working document from the conference and not one simply brought to it\u2019.  \n \nSetting up and first stage of the writing experiment at CLTAD 2010: Observation \nEtymology of observation\/observe: \nLate 14th century: a watching over; to attend to in practice \n 4\n16th century: watch, perceive, notice; a remark in reference to something observed\u2019. \n[http:\/\/www.etymonline.com] \n \nAs explained, each writing experiment is introduced via a main theme derived from the \nPh.D. interview data in 2008\/2009. In Berlin, the choice for the workshop was based on \nthe intimation that, as the city itself is rich in all kinds of visual, urban stimulation, the \nfocus on \u2018watching, perceiving and noticing\u2019 would be appealing. The actual workshop \nturned into a dialogue with Curtis Tappenden (CT), himself a practitioner of drawing and \ncreative writing\/performance, as well as a tutor engaged in this kind of drawing-writing \ncrossover at the University for the Creative Arts. The workshop proved to be a \nstimulating exchange of practice in terms of our respective research areas as well as the \nexperiment itself. The rest of this article, then, documents what took place through \ndrawing and discussing, and adds some simple commentaries on salient points that relate \nto the larger research project with its now large body of experiments.  \n \nObservation one: physical space \nThe allocated room was of the large, institutional lecture kind: technology facilities and \nlarge screens at one end with very long rows of identical chairs facing them. Setting up \nfor the experiment involved screening off a part of this room to provide an empty space, \nslightly denuded of the larger efficiency, and slightly protected from more formal \nlearning connotations. (In fact, for almost all the twenty research experiments, we \noccupied studio space or at least an informal space to spread out in).  \n \n 5\nObservation two: dual emotions  \nIn the experiments, I became both facilitator and participant. And, based on experience, I \nwould suggest that CT and I expressed two of the key emotions generated at the start of \nthe writing experiments. First, some apprehension at entering unknown territory, as if \nbeing asked to perform on the spot, and counterbalanced with this, a desire, almost a \ndare, to see what would happen. It should be emphasized that emotions were pervasive in \nthe experiments not just in this small regard here, but in terms of pursuing the subject \nmatter and as evident in spoken responses. The University of the Arts\u2019 \u2018Unspoken \nInteractions\u2019 (2008), edited by Noam Austerlitz, illuminates this whole area of emotions \nin art\/design\/educational practice. However, I would suggest from the experiments that \nemotions not only seem to be intrinsic \u2018rhythms of practice\u2019, but to be almost \nsynonymous with health, perhaps vigour. I think this is hinted at in the etymological \norigin of emotion \u2013 \u2018moving out\u2019, ie dynamic expression opposed to being stuck, \nstagnancy.  \n \nObservation three: richness of difference \nThe experiment revealed two distinct starting points for the drawing activity. Two \nworlds, in other words, of two individuals coming with two distinct backgrounds, \ncircumstances and two distinct experiences of Berlin. (Had there been six participants, \nthere would have been six distinct contributions, and so on). It will be shown that each \ndrawing, in revealing these differences, generated different possibilities for writing: this \nsomewhat obvious statement is included because, despite homogenizing impositions on \nthe curricula, I still see huge diversity \u2013 as revealed through the experiments.  \n 6\n Observation four: concentration sounds \nWe had at our disposal two large boards covered in brown paper and an amount of \ncharcoal and wax pastels. For around 20 minutes, CT and I turned to the boards to set \ndown observations of Berlin in that time and space; that is to say, we expressed the \nimages and thoughts that came up without pre-meditation, and without any comparison or \nchat. It was absorbing work accompanied by paper shuffling, scraping of charcoal across \nsurfaces, clattering of pastels down on a table, some pauses in between. Not only an \nabsorbing activity, but one defined by space, the sensual, the kinetic. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nFigure 1: HE\u2019s drawing experience \u2013 Layers. \n \n \n \nObservation five: the intense and messy \nHE: For me, [the drawing] looks really messy actually, but it\u2019s got a lot of things that \nhave happened to me in the last few days. It\u2019s quite intense. [\u2026] It\u2019s quite good actually \nbecause I wasn\u2019t sure what I was doing, you know, getting the ideas as you go along. \n \n 7\nAs with hands-on, tacit practices, the content of sketching had not been planned in \nadvance, but was spontaneously bringing stuff up. There is a rough equivalent in verbal \nbrainstorming for an initial generation of ideas for writings. I recognized that not \nknowing what I was doing was a strength \u2013 a bypassing of the conscious that Jane Graves \nrefers to in her description of the creative process in \u2018The Secret life of Objects\u2019 (2007). \n \nObservation six: composition of pleasures \nHE: I did the graffiti thing because I love the graffiti and it\u2019s mad \u2013 it\u2019s just totally mad, \nbut also, that\u2019s Berlin for me, it\u2019s just, that is the word. [\u2026] This bed [\u2026] is because it\u2019s \nbeen a place of serenity and great beds too \u2013 this hotel bed here is really good! Mm, so \nI\u2019ve got all these different experiences [\u2026] Drinking beer late at night [\u2026] so all of those \nthings about em, really strong impressions, really bold things, really bright things. \n \nThe intensity of breathing in the city was for me not (this time) via the greatness of Berlin \nor its sad history or the sublime, but of a very down-to-earth, ridiculous in parts, array \n(not series) of impressions and sensual experiences, and the disparate subject matter are \nunited through that experience, captured on paper and through the overriding emotion. \nThe sum of my sketch is about pleasure and celebration; about registering but not \nevaluating. Perhaps in the disjuncture away from formal prose is a space for the effusive.  \n \nFigure 2: Berlin centre. \n \nObservation seven: on words \n 8\nHE: At first, I thought the words are oppressive \u2013 I don't like the words \u2013 but actually it \nwent into German because I quite like speaking some words of German so \u2013  \n \nI relish an escape into something that is not ordered by words as I spend a lot of \nprofessional time trying to ease art and design student practitioners into academic writing \nculture. This leaning against such order is reflected not only in the nature of the \nexperiment, but in my attraction to visual practices in art and design and the challenge \ninherent in my Ph.D. question (how might designing modes impact writing?). Here, the \nGerman words are enjoyed as part of the stimulus and as a fabric of the city \u2013 the words \nare part of a sound-visual stream. \n \nObservation nine: art school tensions and metaphor \nHE: And then I\u2019ve got the art school. This is the \u2018art school\u2019, from the name of the talk \nthat I went to today, [what is an ideal art school? CLTAD 2010] and I\u2019ve got this feeling \nabout the conference you know that people are kind of getting out, moving out getting to \n\u2013 just a stretching thing although the belts \u2013 the belts are here, on the art school, so that \nwent into it. \n  \nThere is an indiscriminate working across strata of experience in the sketch that has no \nparallel in conventional academic writing in which singling out threads is preferred. \nWhile Berlin the city created a major impact, the talk on the art school reminded me of \nsome of the ideals \u2013 and research sources \u2013 I shared and how many people at the \n 9\nconference were looking for viable ways forward despite the \u2018belts\u2019 (Foucauldian?) \nconstraining the institution. \nThe sketch may also reveal inclinations to connect outside the institution. In any case, it \nhas the quality of operating as a metaphor, suggesting and evoking on a number of layers \nsimultaneously.  \n \nObservation ten: the purposes of drawing \nOn my not being trained in drawing skills, CT infers, \nCT: It\u2019s not an issue, it\u2019s about getting it out, it\u2019s almost like a primal language. \nHE: Yes, it was that thing about \u2018what\u2019s come up for me? What have I observed in the \nlast few days?\u2019 \n \nI did urge a \u2018no apology\u2019 principle for either drawing or writing in the workshops and, in \nthe main, this worked, for myself as well, shedding embarrassment. Obviously there are \nmultiple forms of drawing (drafts, models, sketches, first ideas, design diagrams, maps, \nillustrations, etc) and while many of these are now performed routinely via computers, \neveryone in the twenty workshops managed to draw in one way or another, and mostly \nappreciated this unusual space. I became most enthralled, however, with the totality of \nwhat was witnessed through the drawing effect and the degree of insight that was raised \nthrough the experiments, so CT\u2019s word \u2018primal\u2019 certainly had resonance. \n \nObservation eleven: drawing compared to writing sketches \nCT: Would you have written this in a notebook in a similar way? [\u2026] \n 10\nHE: Not at all, not at all the same. Because I don't know here \u2013 these are images \u2013 these \nare er \u2013 OK, these, most of these are words, but er, em, the colour and the line and the \nstrength of the images, I can't do that straight into words \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not the same, it's \nsomething different but I do want to write from this. \nCT: Mm, so it would be like a springboard prompt into[\u2026] [writing].  \n \nThere is an element of shooting myself in the foot in this extract. The richness, not the \n\u2018language\u2019 (the word is too restrictive), in a drawing is of a different and incomparable \ndimension to words in a string on a line on a page (something that will be dealt with in \nthe Ph.D. thesis). While the drawing would make an excellent kind of springboard for \nwriting in various contexts, the notion behind the experiments is not \u2018draw first, write \nsecond\u2019 in the sense that the drawing is merely a \u2018prompt\u2019, although that may be an \nexcellent practice. It is rather that there is a richness in the drawing that can impact \nwriting, ie when writing is seen as a by-product and not a compulsory outcome. \n \nFigure 3: CT\u2019s drawing experience \u2013 the crack, etc. \n \nObservation thirteen \nCT: I\u2019m here with my family. We\u2019ve had a number of conversations over things because \nmy daughter is twelve and my son is nine \u2013 and they ask \u2013 they are asking questions and \nmany of the answers I don't have because it\u2019s too complicated but it\u2019s forced me \u2013 I was \nreading last night about the complexities of what - we\u2019ve all been thinking a lot about it.  \n \n 11\nCT\u2019s individual drawing investigation, then, has begun from another angle altogether: a \nsubjective one this time derived from family discussions and a need to understand. It is \nthe personal motivation to find out that has led to reading around Berlin and has then \nbeen absorbed into the drawing to some extent. This archiving of Berlin, the city, has \ngone back into history, huge tensions, and inevitably into the notions of fundamental \nsplits rather than the more sensual appreciation of my own drawing.  \n \nObservation fourteen: listening to cities \nCT: I listen to cities. \nHE: Yeah, that\u2019s a good expression, actually.  \nCT: Because cities talk to you. \n \nThe mention of listening, just a brief remark about how cities talk suggests a way into \nwritings that might be polyphonic, a dialogue, a monologue and so forth. CT connects the \npolyphonic direction to the jester in Observation sixteen.  \n \nObservation fifteen: Berlin history of the crack \nCT: Mm. The \u2013 the beginning of it was a crack \u2013  \nHE: Yeah, nice. Yeah, nice. \nCT: Because you\u2019ve got two halves \u2013 you\u2019ve got east and west \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s the city first of \nall [\u2026] although bits of the conference do feed into it because the crack is obviously a \nhuge divide. I was just amazed \u2013 I was looking through the book last night and realising \nhow, em, a place that was together as republics then divided then unified then broken \n 12\nthen unified can actually really be unified. And although you\u2019ve got something going \nacross, there\u2019s still a crack in the middle. And even with the walls down, there are still \npeople trying to climb to get to somewhere here, I think. But also, I\u2019m alluding to what \nwe\u2019re doing here which is we\u2019re trying to climb with our knowledge.  \n \n \nFigure 4: Photograph of the wall, restaurant, Bundestag, Berlin. \n \nCT has documented in his drawing the crucial divide in Berlin the city. Then there is a \nparallel allusion to the \u2018academy\u2019 and the notion of climbing up \u2013 a synchronicity \nbetween our two sketches, even while CT\u2019s is an espousal of knowledge and mine a \nhastening to lose it outside the academy. There are the multiple layers again, visual \nmetaphors: whereas mine is concerned with the sensual layers, CT\u2019s is concerned with \nhistorical ones \u2013 and that very graphic crack. CT comments: \n \u2018I believe us to be vitally grounded and rooted in our histories, upon which we build, \nthen move so as to change the space upon which our two feet stand. [\u2026] This adherence \nto the historical as an underpinning base for my drawing and writings is for me a key \ndiscipline, which although it may affect my free expression, offers me the permission to \nexplore within and beyond. I like the tension of these boundaries and freedoms\u2019. \n \nWhat is interesting is how CT asserts his respect for knowledge whereas I am bound (in \nthis experiment) to expressing experience: I can imagine these two threads leading to \n 13\ndivergent written outcomes. These might be most obviously more reflective and critical \nin CT\u2019s case; more expressive and poetic in my own (this, just one possibility).  \nFurther, CT\u2019s emphasis on the more intellectual enquiry behind who we are that enters \nthe drawing is something I need to counterbalance against my own enthusiasm for the \n\u2018primary\u2019 of drawing and a strong leaning towards ideation.  \n \n \nObservation sixteen: the jester \nCT: There are a number of cross- allus- allusions going on. We \u2013 this was just in my \nmind about the juggler, the spinner, the jester, but actually, he\u2019s looking up, motivated to \nmove on \u2013 perhaps that\u2019s the optimism in the city. Spinning the plates.  \n \nCT\u2019s jester brings another dimension, potentially a narrative: a symbolic character that \nhints at another kind of myth, or non-historical force. CT therefore manages to convey a \ntension (always exciting) between two opposing forces in the city, one of the past and one \nof the present. He adds, \u2018The jester connection has found its root in what Mikhail Bakhtin \nwrote about the Carnival; that the power lay in the polyphonic voices of the participants, \nmany voices and expressions expressing diversity but with a forward purpose of mind, a \nunified gathering which expresses truth\u2019. \n \nObservation seventeen: an angel \n 14\nCT: When the taxi driver [\u2026] brought us back, and she was really proud of the fact that \nthe golden angel is over Berlin: she looks over us, she watches over us and I felt that was \noptimism. So there\u2019s kind of optimism and a little bit of negativity.  \n \nThe angel in the drawing was observed, pointed out, an actual statue, and it connected to \nthe family experience and the taxi contact, as well as representing a strong sense of an \noptimistic mood. In other words, there is a sense of condensation here, or meanings held \ntogether in one image \u2013 both real and metaphoric.  \n \nEnd notes \nThe sketches are governed by individual circumstance and experience. One is more \nsensual and layered with pleasures; the other is more narrative, illuminating a crack of \nhistory and an inherent tension. On another occasion, in distinct circumstances, the \ncontent could be worlds apart from these two. Whatever the case, such a visual record is \nrich and provides rich pickings.  \n \nSeeing drawing through such experiments is to witness its strengths in terms of ideation, \nas a trace or document, a generator of something whole; it can in addition prove a \ncompelling medium for communication, where writing becomes a fruitful (not \ncompulsory) by-product.  \n \nIronically, the practice of \u2018design time\u2019 meant no writing was produced within the \nallotted time \u2013 the title of the workshop thus becomes a misnomer. Or was this just part \n 15\nof a deferral tactic: a desire for the peculiar closet-space of solitary writing? Drawing and \nspeaking appear generally to be much more seductive and group-friendly. In fact, there \nare three texts emerging from this particular experiment: this piece for CLTAD, a poetry \npiece envisaged by Curtis Tappenden and a sound-image piece waiting for a post-thesis \nbreathing space in my own case. \n \nObservation eighteen: beyond experiment and conference \nCT: So, that was kind of it, really. \nHE: In fact, we \u2013 we\u2019ve spoken our writing.  \nCT: We have, yeah, yeah. And there\u2019s a poem in that, or there\u2019s a piece of short writing \nin it \u2013 \nHE: Maybe we can do it \u2013 maybe we can send each other something that comes up from \n\u2013 so that we have a bit of a \u2013 \nCT: It\u2019d be good. \nHE: I think so. \nTC: Good.  \n \n \nReferences \nArnheim, R.
