Thanks to \nthe broad range of perspectives presented and the quality of discussion these provoked, the stream \ndeveloped an initial critical understanding of what happens at and around the boundaries of firms in \nmarket contexts through deployment of the concepts of exchange, identity, self and otherness. Since \nwe see Marketing Theory as the natural home for such topics, the four co-convenors of the stream \napproached the Editor-in-Chief with the proposal for a Special Issue aimed at extending critical \nscholarship around these themes. This edition of the journal represents the outcome of the resulting \nCall for Papers. \n \nFrom our perspective as Guest Editors, the key consideration for inclusion in the Special Issue was \nthat authors explicitly pursued a critical analysis of managerial and\/or consumer constructions of self \nand\/or other, whether in terms of B2C or B2B exchanges. We were looking for pieces that offered \ninsights into notions of identity, variously conceived, with respect to the individual\u2019s and the \norganization\u2019s engagements with others (such as consumers, governments, other commercial \norganizations, pressure groups and so on). Furthermore, the Call for Papers invited contributors to \nconsider a range of different and interconnected forms of exchange - social, economic and material, \nand the flow of (cultural) ideas. Within this context, some of the questions we hoped to explore \nincluded: How may the role of markets, boundaries, their materiality or discourses, be considered as \nproductive of identity? How are repertoires, scripts, theories or narratives as well as material objects \nbrought to bear in the construction of \u2018the market\u2019 and the legitimization of the self as a market \nparticipant? How do participants negotiate and deploy, resist or subvert market exchanges? \nFrom the submissions received, a dozen papers fitted this brief sufficiently closely to be sent out for \nreview and, after a rigorous double-blind review process (even for those papers that had originally \nbeen presented at CMS5) we arrived at five pieces for inclusion.  In this introductory essay, we \n2 \n \noutline the contributions made by the papers that were finally selected, and discuss some of the key \noverarching themes that we see emerging from this fascinating collection of studies. To put these \ncontributions in context, we begin with a short conceptual preface regarding the call\u2019s key issues.  \n \nConceptual Preface \n \nAs observed in an editorial introduction to a previous Special Issue of this journal on market \npractices and forms (edited by Araujo, Kjellberg and Spencer, 2008), the concept of \u2018the market\u2019 has \nbeen notably under-theorized by marketing scholars. This curious state of affairs (given the \ncentrality of the notion to the field), in which scholars have taken for granted the existence of \u2018the \nmarket\u2019 as an a priori, self-generating reality, has perpetuated a situation in which there is only a \nnascent understanding of markets, and market exchanges, as social constructions. This \nconstructionist view of markets underpinned the call for papers for this Special Issue, with authors \nencouraged to explore different hues of the processes of social construction at play in (or around the \nedges of) the various social actions, discursive forms and material practices that constitute market \nexchanges. Beyond the promulgation of a constructionist view of markets and marketing, our more \nspecific goal in the production of this Special Issue is to develop a set of nuanced theoretical and \nempirical insights into the nature of boundary work which gives form to the processes of identity \nconstruction and social differentiation of a variety of actors in market exchanges. \n \nBoundary work is a central activity in the social construction of market exchanges. Michel Callon\u2019s \n(1998) The Law of Markets, a key text in the canon of a practice-based approach to social science, \nemploys notions of \u2018framing\u2019 to discuss how markets come into being \u2018through a range of practices \ninvolving different forms of expertise and material devices\u2019 (Araujo et al., 2008: 6). As noted by \nAraujo et al. (2008), Callon is critical of both the reifying and essentializing tendencies of neoclassical \neconomic views of the market as well as Granovetter\u2019s (1985) social embeddedness thesis. In terms \nof setting boundaries around market activities, framing demarcates those elements which are taken \ninto account and those which are ignored (or treated as \u2018external\u2019). For Callon, \u2018it is owing to this \nframing that the market can exist and that distinct agents and distinct goods can be brought into \nplay\u2019 (1998: 17). This constructionist perspective on markets is also held by Vickers (1995: 87) who \nclaims:  \n\u2018economic decisions and market actions are based, not on discoverable and therefore \nobjectively existing economic knowledge, but on the imagination with which individuals \ncan contemplate future possible outcomes of actions \u2026 .\u2019  \n3 \n \nIn this way, market transactions can be constructed, or performed, whereby things are transformed \ninto commodities, and agents into sellers and buyers. For instance, for a car to go from the \nproducer-seller to the customer-buyer, it has to be \u2018disentangled\u2019, such that the ties between this \ncommodity and other objects or human actors are cut, and boundaries erected around the frame. If \nthe thing remains entangled, then the recipient cannot escape from the web of relations, and the \nframing is never over (Callon, 1998). By analysing the process of \u2018marketization\u2019 as one that implies \ninvestments and actions to build particular boundaries, thereby cutting certain ties and internalising \nothers, we can avoid the risk of essentialism when we consider the market regime. As Vickers (1995: \n94) puts it: \u2018Epistemically, the individual in the marketplace is influenced by the swirl of the reality \ncomplexes that continually emerge even when the market transaction is in process\u2019. So what are \nsome of the \u2018reality complexes\u2019 that come to bear on social constructions of identity and boundaries \nduring market transactions? \n \nThe Special Issue on market practices and forms (Araujo et al., 2008) presents a number of studies \nthat illustrate this \u2018performative idiom\u2019 of the market that offers one route into these reality \ncomplexes through the prism of practice-based social science. Whilst Cochon\u2019s (2008) paper \npresents the results of an ethnographic study of shopping carts as a frame through which consumers \nmodify their shopping calculations and become part of a collective act of consumption, Finch and \nAcha studied the sale and construction of value of a second-hand oil field illustrating the \u2018different \nversions and valuations\u2019 (2008: 45) that existed during this market exchange. Simakova and \nNeyland\u2019s (2008) paper on a new product development and launch similarly illustrate the multiple \nefforts and forms of exchange that shape markets. Specifically they focus on how a range of firms, \npeople and objects interact with each other to create the radio frequency identification market, \ncrucially through narrative practices. Such narrative practices specify relations, mark boundaries, \ncreate identities and make possible social action for these particular actors. \n  \nIn terms of performing markets, the papers collected by Araujo et al. (2008) demonstrate how the \nboundary work enacted in the interactions and networks of people, objects and organizations serve \nto create the conditions of possibility not only for value creation, but also for identity construction. \nThough framed from a different theoretical perspective, there are overlaps in the insights provided \nby this collection with scholars working on the anthropology of things. Appadurai\u2019s (1986) discussion \nof Marx\u2019s commodity thesis in Volume One of Capital for instance outlines three components of the \n\u2018commodity situation\u2019 \u2013 the commodity phase, commodity candidacy and commodity context. And \nKopytoff\u2019s (1986) commoditization process thesis takes the view that objects have biographies or life \n4 \n \nhistories in which they can move in and out of a commodity state, and through which their meanings \ncan change and become subject to cultural regulation. Both Appadurai and Kopytoff take the object, \nor more specifically the commodity, as the basis for understanding how action, meaning, value and \nidentities come into being through shifting signifying and material forms. \n \nContinuing with anthropological insights on the reality complexes of market exchanges, Lien (1997) \nargues that the concept of \u2018the market\u2019 performs two functions for market participants, especially \nthose charged with marketing \u2018management\u2019: it serves as a model \u2018of\u2019 the world as it is, and as \nmodel \u2018for\u2019 appropriate action. This distinction implies a need for researchers to explore the ways in \nwhich things like \u2018markets\u2019 and \u2018consumers\u2019 come to be taken for granted as naturally occurring \nentities, existing independently of their processes of construction. The metaphors (or theories) that \nare commonly used by actors to structure propositional claims or to justify certain strategies, create \nsocial realities which may guide future action. \n \nThe distinction drawn by Lien (1997) is similar to Araujo et al.\u2019s (2008: 8) call for scholars to study \n\u2018efforts to shape markets as well as efforts to operate in markets qua structures (e.g. to promote, \nadvertise, sell) and the intended and unintended interactions between these practices\u2019. In this \nregard, Lien\u2019s key contribution is to draw attention to the role of metaphor, and specifically \nmarketers\u2019 deployment of a market metaphor, to classify, categorize and perform this object. In so \ndoing, their \u2018discursive elaboration of an imagined \u201cmarket\u201d serves, simultaneously, as a key factor \nin the reproduction of the locality itself\u2019 (Lien, 1997: 90). This suggests a need for careful analysis of \nthe performative consequences of the various theories\/metaphors in use by market actors; theories \nin which \u2018a considerable effort is devoted to elaborating cultural differences within a continuum of \nfamiliarity on the one hand and foreignness on the other\u2019 (Ibid: 11). Marketing practice thus \n\u2018communicates difference\u2019, say, between one customer segment and another, or between \u2018experts\u2019 \nand \u2018neophytes\u2019, or even between the \u2018tamed\u2019 (through marketing) and the \u2018untamed\u2019 market. In \nthis respect, Lien\u2019s ethnographic insights into the frozen food market pre-dates Kjellberg and \nHelgesson\u2019s (2006) call for empirical studies to describe and discuss the exchange, normalising and \nrepresentational practices that give life to particular markets. \n  \nMoving away from Lien\u2019s anthropological sensitivities (yet retaining the language theme), the \nanalysis of linguistic practices forms a major part of this Special Issue\u2019s exploration of identity and \nboundary construction. The discursive approaches taken by a number of the papers reflects the \nargument of Phillips and Hardy (2002: 52) that \u2018we cannot understand processes of organizing unless \n5 \n \nwe understand identity \u2013 and understand it from a discursive perspective because reified views of \nidentity do not help researchers capture the fluidity of social life\u2019. These discursive approaches offer \na further invitation to understand the reality complexes of market exchanges, and the centrality of \nboundary work to them. This perspective is important in analyzing social life in the ambiguous and \ndynamic context of marketing exchanges where actors are engaged in the construction of a \u2018tellable\u2019 \nmarketing story which \u2018narrates boundaries, relations, agency and identities\u2026\u2019 (Simakova and \nNeyland, 2008: 96). Language use by participants in marketing exchanges produces particular ways \nof understanding such trading encounters and defines appropriate patterns of social activity, thus \nforming the basis for action (Palmer and Dunford 1996). Studying how these forms of understanding \npattern the self and the environment will develop our comprehension of market actors\u2019 potential \nmodes of engagement. \n \nMore generally, our understanding of who we are is intimately connected to who we think others \nare; and a focus on identity discourse helps to direct analytic attention to how social actors \nrecursively make sense of themselves in relation to others. Through \u2018discursive positioning\u2019 (e.g. \nHopkinson, 2001), placing ourselves vis-\u00e0-vis others by drawing distinctions or by assuming \nresemblance and relatedness in everyday discourse, we talk our identities into being, producing a \nparticular notion of \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018me\u2019 by comparison to \u2018them\u2019. Identity can therefore be seen as a matter \nof locating boundaries through the discursive enactment of relationships of similarity and difference. \nClaims of \u2018sameness\u2019 or \u2018otherness\u2019 in relation to, for instance, colleagues, clients or competitors, \nserve to position organizational members within a particular social context, hence establishing, \nlegitimating and\/or challenging relationships of power and status (Ybema et al., 2009).  \nSince market actors (including managers representing producers and intermediaries, as well as \nconsumers) frequently have to position themselves across different discourses and divides before a \nheterogeneous audience, it seems likely that we will find intense \u2018boundary work\u2019 (Hernes and \nPaulsen, 2003) or \u2018identity work\u2019 \u2013 that is, \u2018the ongoing mental activity that an individual undertakes \nin constructing an understanding of self\u2019 (Alvesson, Ashcraft and Thomas, 2008: 14) \u2013 performed at \nthe notional boundaries of organizations and marketplaces. Exploring these discursive practices is \nimportant to the study of marketing since it illustrates how marketers and customers construct the \nrelationships that constitute the proximate environment of \u2018the market\u2019, while simultaneously \nsecuring their own position within (or indeed outwith) it. \n  \nRecent empirical studies of cultural intermediaries (notably Cronin, 2004, McFall, 2004 and Moor, \n2008) \u2013 those in occupations that produce symbolic and cultural goods and services that form part of \n6 \n \nwhat Bourdieu (1984) refers to as the new petite bourgeoisie --  illustrate the interplay of boundary \nwork and identity construction. For one, these studies illustrate empirically how culture and the \neconomy (as well as production and consumption) are mutually imbricated and consequently hybrid \ncategories produced through the work of cultural intermediaries; cultural objects are increasingly \nsubject to economic logic, whilst economic logic hinges upon specific cultural values and formations. \nMoreover, the value created by cultural intermediaries, as noted by Bourdieu, rests on the \nembodied capital and subjective knowledge and preferences they bring as consumers to their work \nas producers. Their cultural capital serves not only to bring a form of cultural legitimacy to a \nparticular object, it also in turn anchors their own professional status in an organization (as \nillustrated in Sender\u2019s (2008) study of sexuality as a cultural resource used to underpin the identity \nof gay marketing professionals), as well as their wider social status in respect of other class fractions.   \nThe papers in this collection, using different frames of reference and with different materials, \nattempt to consider in a multiplicity of ways the boundary work that goes into market exchanges \nand identity construction. They do so in ways that complement whilst extending the discussion of \nmarket exchange formation found in the earlier Special Issue on market practices through the \npresentation of a greater range of theoretical perspectives and a very specific conceptual focus on \nboundary work. Together, the papers offer a plural view of the nature of boundary work. This Special \nIssue confirms that market actors tend to picture their selves in terms of an ongoing \u2018conversation\u2019 \nthat takes place across a further perceived boundary; a boundary between \u2018internal\u2019 ideas, desires \nand affections and \u2018external\u2019 images and evaluations. In the next section we outline the different \nways in which the papers accomplish this. \n \nThe Papers \n \nThe first of the five papers, which is by Finch and Geiger, tackles a concept very familiar to the \nmarketing community \u2013 that of positioning. However, it does so using an analytical perspective \u2013 \nactor network theory (ANT) - only relatively recently embraced by marketing scholars. The paper \nargues that, beyond its immediate managerial use, positioning is a \u2018balancing act\u2019 that requires \nmarketers to make their products (or \u2018objects\u2019) both comparable to other objects in a market frame \n(Callon, 1998), and at the same time singular to the consumer with reference to what lies outside \nthe market frame. This balancing act is attainable because of what they term \u2018the marketing object\u2019; \nan object that carries both possibilities \u2013 and hence the boundaries of the market \u2013 in it.  Finch and \nGeiger explain that as part of their normal marketing activities marketers position market objects \nand thereby provide means for other market actors to evaluate differences and similarities. This \n7 \n \nprocess is resonant with Lien\u2019s (1997) study of the manner in which metaphors are used to \ncommunicate difference.  In this way marketers help disentangle product offerings in a market \nspace, so formatting them as \u2018market objects\u2019.  Marketers simultaneously refer to cultural and \nmaterial dimensions in the worlds of producing and consuming, thereby re-entangling these market \nobjects in worlds beyond the market and re-formatting them as \u2018marketing objects\u2019.  As a result, \npositioning can refer to many \u2018others\u2019 - producers and consumers as well as those others which are \nnecessarily poorly defined. By building on ANT perspectives with insights from the sociological and \nanthropological literatures, Finch and Geiger\u2019s paper deepens our understanding of the (object-\nrelated) positioning work carried out by marketing practitioners that takes place at the notional \nboundary of the market. Its main contribution is in the way it pluralizes boundary work using a \nparticularly novel approach, enabling us to see positioning in a manner that moves beyond the \nsimple dimensions of the perceptual maps so commonly presented in managerial texts.  \n \nNext, in the only paper in this Special Issue that focuses solely on the consumption element of \nmarketing exchange, Patterson and Schroeder address perhaps the ultimate corporeal boundary, \nthat of skin. The authors critically interrogate conceptualizations of identity within consumer culture \ntheory (CCT) by considering tattoo culture, and exploring the double-sidedness of skin, its ambiguity \nand ambivalence. In this way, they examine the relationship between identity and consumption \ndrawing upon the literature on the body and skin from sociology, cultural studies, feminism and \nconsumer research. Utilizing three skin metaphors (skin as container, projection surface, and cover \nto be modified) to frame their discussion, Patterson and Schroeder generate a series of insights into \nintercorporeality, embodiment, and body projects. They further address these issues by examining \ninterview data generated from a prior study of heavily tattooed women. Ultimately, they suggest \nthat researchers may benefit by reducing their urge to seek meaning \u2013 a behaviour they seek as \nindicative of much recent consumer research -- and valorize instead an examination of what \nconsuming bodies do. In an elegant twist on the notion of boundaries in relation to marketing \nexchange, Patterson and Schroeder use their analysis of tattooed skin to affirm that work on the \nborder truly effaces that border. This is perhaps the most fascinating insight in a paper that is full of \nsimilarly subtle observations about the nature of boundaries in marketing exchanges. The authors \nconclude by calling for further boundary work that builds on this contribution in order to engage \nwith our understanding of identity and consumption, grounded by cultural history, embodiment, and \nlived experience.  \n \n8 \n \nThe third piece in this collection, by Smith Maguire, looks at the subjective dynamics of markets by \nproblematizing a particular cadre of marketing practitioner, the cultural intermediary. It asks how \nthe affective capacities and cultural capital of these practitioners serve as the basis for value \ncreation, via the \u2018engineering\u2019 of affective opportunities and paths for consumers. The author \nexamines the liminality of cultural intermediaries through a case study of wine promoters, using the \ntheme of \u2018provenance\u2019 to provide an empirical perspective. These social actors mediate between \nproduction and consumption from a liminal position, forever oscillating twixt the boundaries of the \nvarious relations that support market exchange in the notional supply chain for wine. In other words, \ntheir liminal status affords them a view of both sides of the market equation as they operate at the \ninterfaces between and within firms, and between firms and customers, and reflexively negotiate \nbetween their roles as symbolic producers and taste-leading consumers. Smith Maguire\u2019s study \nexamines narratives that encompass both wine promoters\u2019 work in creating added-value for \nparticular wines, and their identities as reflexive producer\/consumers. In its distinctive account of \nboundary work in practice, the article contributes to emerging research on the subjectivity of market \npractitioners. This provides an enlightening view of the relationship between production and \nconsumption, but one which Smith Maguire argues has yet to be fully developed in marketing theory \nand its discussions of value co-creation and the pro-active consumer (or \u2018prosumer\u2019). It is in its \nexposition of how cultural intermediaries negotiate the \u2018inbetween\u2019 that the paper makes its most \nresonant contribution to our understanding of boundary work, especially in its focus on these \nintermediaries as prosumers (rather than end users) in the context of their reflexive identity project. \nThe author concludes that further research on such liminal occupations is necessary to grasp how \ncultural intermediaries attempt to channel consumers\u2019 freedom along prescribed routes by \naffiliating their perceived fears and aspirations with particular product qualities. \n \nFittingly then, some of the themes in Smith Maguire\u2019s work are addressed by the fourth paper here, \nthat by Parsons. This study explores the intermediate world of market participants acting as what \nthe author designates \u2018market\u2019 rather than \u2018cultural\u2019 intermediaries. In this case, the main actors \nunder scrutiny are antique dealers. The paper explores the antique world as a \u2018marketplace \ninstitution\u2019 within which particular sets of discourses circulate, and examines the intersection of \nthese discourses in dealers\u2019 constructions of self, others and the \u2018world\u2019. Parsons analyses interview \ndata to search for ways in which market exchanges in the world of antique trading offer dealers \nresources for the creation and expression of their identities. She takes a perspective of identity as \ndiscursively produced through interaction, with dealers drawing on discursive repertoires of taste \nand aesthetics, and of morality and care, to construct identities. In doing so they mobilize differing, \n9 \n \n(and typically oppositional) constructions of a variety of \u2018others\u2019: customers, other dealers, antique \nmarkets and antique objects.  Parson argues that conceiving of the world of antique dealing as a \nmarketplace institution directs attention towards the sharing and circulation of discourses within \nand between networks of dealers, traders, collectors and auction houses. Her study focuses on the \nways in which these discourses are differentially (re)created, adopted and inter-woven in dealers\u2019 \nidentity projects. Her findings add to the burgeoning number of studies of market(ing) participants \nthat draw upon discursive approaches (e.g. Ellis and Ybema, 2010; Hopkinson, 2003) by helping us to \nunderstand how discourses and identities are thoroughly embedded in the marketplace. The main \ncontributions of this paper are in showing how the sharing and circulation of discourses is key to \nboundary work; and, moreover, to relate this work to the notion of the market intermediary rather \nthan the more widely-understood idea of the cultural intermediary.  \n \nThe Special Issue concludes with a paper by Cameron, Lightfoot, Lilley and Brown which offers us a \nrather different take on market identities and boundaries from those explored in the preceding \ncontributions. In a return to some of the theoretical concerns of our first paper (by Finch and \nGeiger), the authors claim that the \u2018turn to practice\u2019 across a broad range of social science areas, \nincluding marketing (see Araujo et al., 2008) often involves a move towards \u2018post-social\u2019 or \u2018object-\ncentred\u2019 analysis. In a note of caution against going too far down this track, the authors ask: to what \nextent is it possible to think about markets and exchange without some version of the social acting \nas the basis for explanation?  In the particular context of financial markets, a \u2018postsocial\u2019 perspective \nis often premised on the idea that new technologies, in particular screen displays of complex real-\ntime financial information, have displaced \u2018the market\u2019 from the social and economic relations in \nwhich it might otherwise be assumed to be embedded. Instead, Cameron et al. argue that recent \nhistorical transformations in trading and markets are better characterized as \u2018re-spatialisations\u2019 \ninvolving perceived shifts in boundaries that are founded on the placing and mediation of market \nspatiality. They employ the notion of the \u2018xeno-economy\u2019 to show how the spatial redistributions of \nthe market has not been so much to efface sociality as set up new kinds of relations between local \ntraders and institutions, notably mediated through geographically displaced \u2018trading arcades\u2019. Their \nanalysis emphasizes the immanence of modes of sociality to markets as intrinsically and necessarily \nsocial objects. Cameron et al. conclude that practice-based approaches quite legitimately draw \nattention to the labour which underpins the constitution of markets, including financial ones. They \nargue, however, that we also need to understand the complex historical dynamic of the shifting \nspatial placings and re-placings of identities, mediated by technology, which have delivered us the \nmarkets we are now obliged to inhabit. The main contribution to boundary work of this piece is the \n10 \n \nway it looks at the virtual space and role of technology. It shows how technology mediates and \ncreates the conditions for particular and changing kinds of market-related boundary work and \nsubjectivation because it provides a different spatial order in which these processes can take place. \n \nConclusion \n \nThis edition of Marketing Theory represents the outcome of the Call for Papers which emerged from \nthe Critical Marketing stream at CMS5 and was designed to develop critical scholarship around the \ntheme of boundary work and identity construction in market exchanges. The papers comprising this \nSpecial Issue bring fresh conceptual and empirical insights into the boundary work that takes place in \nand around various forms of market exchanges. The authors address issues of how markets and \nmarketing are organized, and show how boundary work is captured through processes of self-\nidentification and differentiation. The studies presented here all bring novel approaches to bear on \nthe analysis of market exchanges. They refuse to work with a priori reified distinctions. They show, in \na variety of approaches, how market objects and participants are realized in discursive and material \nform: for instance in considering the positioning of boundary objects in terms of both market and \nmarketing activities; in illustrating how work on borders can serve to efface those very borders; in \nhighlighting the discursive prosumer identity constructions of cultural intermediaries; in exploring \nthe discursive work done by market intermediaries; and in articulating the influence of technology \non spatial notions of the market. Taken together, the papers show that boundary work in market-\nrelated contexts is a plural and complex phenomenon. \n   \nThe simple idea that markets and everything \u2018within\u2019 them are socially constructed offers a challenge \nto marketing-theoretical positions which ignore the role of discursive and linguistic practices and \nhold fast to a \u2018common sense\u2019 or pragmatic approach to the development of marketing theory. This \nSpecial Issue provides an example of the kinds of insights which are provided when the role of \ndiscourse and language is suitably acknowledged. The editors argue that further research of this kind \ninto a wide range of market contexts, actors, exchanges, objects, signs and relationships is both \ndesirable and achievable, and that critical marketing scholarship has an important role to play in the \nfurther development and enrichment of marketing theory. \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank the following people for making this Special Issue possible: the participants in the CMS \n2007 marketing stream for their enthusiasm; the paper reviewers for their constructive and prompt \nresponses; the authors for their fascinating contributions; and Pauline Maclaran for her support for \nour project.  \n  \n12 \n \nReferences \n \nAlvesson, M., Ashcraft, K.L. and Thomas, R.
