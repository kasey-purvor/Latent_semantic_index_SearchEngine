The propagation time of the light pulses is controlled\nby the pulse itself (self-induced speed control) or by injection of\na second pump pulse (external speed control). Our simulations on\nthe basis of spatially and temporally resolved QD Maxwell\u2013Bloch\nequations reveal that the excitation and relaxation dynamics in-\nduced by the propagating pulse or a pump pulse within the active\ncharge carrier system leads to a complex gain and index dynamics\nthat may either speed up or slow down the propagating light pulse.\nThe physical effects allowing for the dynamic speed control could\nbe ascribed to complex (coherent and incoherent) level dynamics\nleading to dynamic gain saturation and index dispersion. The de-\npendence of the propagation time on injection current density and\npulse energy is discussed.

INTRODUCTION\nTUNABLE pulse propagation time in optical media by con-trollable modification of the nonlinear index of refraction\nhas in recent years caused great excitement as it opens the possi-\nbility of a new class of optical components with optical memory\ncapability. First experiments by Hau et al. [1] used the technique\nof electromagnetically induced transparency to slow down light\npropagation velocity to 17 m\/s. More recently, Bigelow et al.\ndemonstrated light slowdown to 59 m\/s [2] by the technique of\ncoherent population oscillation (CPO). One advantage of CPO\ncompared to other slow-light techniques is its insensitivity to\nthe quantum mechanical coherence of the optical dipoles in the\noptical medium interacting with the signal light. Thus, the above\nmentioned result using CPO could be realized at room tempera-\nture. Very recent results demonstrating CPO in room temperature\nsemiconductor components such as a quantum well saturable ab-\nsorber [3] and a quantum-dot (QD) optical amplifier [4] suggest\nthat tunable slow light may be realized in practical components.\nA fundamental issue in slow light schemes is to achieve a\nlarge slowdown over a sufficiently large bandwidth. The very\nlarge slowdown in [2], for instance, was at the cost of a very\nManuscript received March 29, 2006; revised June 22, 2006.

This, however, was achieved\nat correspondingly larger bandwidths of 20 GHz and 2.6 THz,\nrespectively.\nIn this paper, we numerically analyse the light induced delay\nand advancement of an ultrashort optical pulse propagating in\na QD SOA corresponding to the results reported in [4]. Due\nto the specific physical properties of the active medium (e.g.,\ndiscrete energy levels, high gain, low threshold current, low\nalpha factor [5] and high-speed modulation [6]) QD based semi-\nconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) represent promising sys-\ntems for novel optoelectronic components in data storage and\ntelecommunication. The simulations are based on spatially re-\nsolved QD Maxwell\u2013Bloch equations [7] that take into account\nspatiotemporal light propagation in the waveguiding structure,\nthe spatialdependence and microscopic coupling between light\nand carriers as well as dynamic excitation and relaxation of\nthe charge carrier plasma via carrier\u2013carrier and carrier\u2013phonon\nscattering. Our numerical results provide a spatiotemporally re-\nsolved analysis of gain and index dynamics responsible for the\ndynamic shaping of the propagating light pulse. The theoretical\nresults are compared to an experimental investigation performed\nwith a pump-probe setup with heterodyne detection.\nII. EXPERIMENT AND SAMPLE DETAILS\nCross-correlation traces of a pulse propagated through a QD\nSOA and a reference pulse travelling outside the device were\nrecorded using a heterodyne detection technique [8] (Fig. 1).\nFrom the temporal profile of the characterized pulse, changes\nin the pulse propagation time and shape were recorded when\nparameters such as pulse energy and SOA bias current were\nchanged. In some of the experiments an additional pump pulse\nwas launched into the SOA at a specific time before the char-\nacterized pulse, to measure the corresponding pump-induced\nchanges in the characterized pulse.

Changing the\ndrive power of AOM 2 allowed the intensity of the character-\nized pulse to be changed by two orders of magnitude from the\nsmall signal regime to saturation without changing the relative\ntiming of the pulses. In the experiments where a pump-pulse\nwas launched into the SOA, the pump pulse energy was in the\nsaturation regime, while the characterized pulse was at a much\nlower energy and in the small-signal regime.\nThe component under investigation was a ridge-waveguide\nQD SOA of length 2 mm and width 7 m. The active layer con-\nsisted of five sheets of self-organized InAs dots grown on GaAs\nand overgrown with a 5-nm InGaAs layer [9]. Each layer had a\ndot surface density of 4 10 cm and the dot ensemble dis-\nplayed a ground state emission wavelength centered at 1260 nm\nand with an inhomogeneous linewidth of 90 nm. The ultrafast\ngain and index dynamics of this SOA was characterized exper-\nimentally and modelled theoretically with a phenomenological\nmodel in [10]. The laser source delivering the short pulses was a\nTi:sapphire oscillator, regenerative amplifier, and optical para-\nmetric amplifier in cascade. The pulses were coupled in and out\nof the waveguide by means of microscope objectives. Before\neach measurement run alignment of the microscope objectives\nwas optimized for maximum coupling to the waveguide. We find\nthe coupling loss to be about 10 dB at each facet. We also find\na day-to-day variation in the coupling loss so there is a varia-\ntion of the pulse energy coupled into the waveguide for a given\npulse energy measured in free-space before incoupling. For this\nreason, it is necessary to allow a pulse energy variation in the\norder of a factor 2 in the modelling of the experiment.\nIII. CARRIER DYNAMICS AND SPATIOTEMPORAL GAIN AND\nINDEX DYNAMICS\nOur computational modelling of pulse propagation in QD\nlasers is based on a mesoscopic theoretical description [7] (see\nappendix). The propagation of an optical light pulse (in the\nmodel realized via the boundary conditions of the light fields\nat the facets) induces highly nonequilibrium distributions in the\ncharge carrier ensemble populating the dots. The dots of our\nconsidered system have a pyramidal shape, with typical base\nlength of 14 nm leading to three electron level energies (180,\n100, and 85 meV, relative to the band edge of the conduction\nband in the wetting layer) and five hole level energies (110, 90,\n75, 70, and 55 meV, relative to the band edge of the valence band\nin the wetting layer). As an example, Fig. 2 visualizes the car-\nrier dynamics in the three electron levels (e1\u2013e3) and five hole\nlevels (h1\u2013h5) during the propagation of a resonant light pulse.\nAt the start of the calculation the injection current density has\nbeen set to . The input energy of the pulse is\nwhere is the pulse saturation energy (defined as the energy\nat which the gain has decreased by 3 dB [17]).\nDepending on the individual dipole matrix elements and level\nstructure a dynamic depletion of the level occurs. The specific\nshape of this dynamic level-hole burning thereby depends on\ninjection current density, input pulse energy and intradot scat-\ntering. In the given example, the level separation is near the\nlongitudinal optical (LO) phonon energy leading to a dynamic\nexchange of carriers on the individual levels via emission and\nFig. 2. Dynamics of level occupations in the(a) electron and (b) hole levels\ncalculated at the center of the output facet during the passage of the pulse.\nabsorption of LO phonons. In particular, the refilling of the res-\nonant dot levels from higher-energy levels (e.g., e3, h5) may\nlead to a partial recovery of the gain [18].\nThe changes in the carrier ensemble are directly correlated\nto corresponding changes in the dipole dynamics coupling the\nindividual electron and holes levels. The sum (over all electron\nhole level combinations) of these microscopic dipole densities\ncomposes the polarization entering the wave equation. Dividing\nthe real and imaginary part of the polarization by the optical\nfields leads to the complex susceptibility which directly\nrevals the index and gain dynamics via its real and imaginary\npart, respectively. This definition is in accordance with the def-\ninition of the susceptiblity via the expression that\nis typically used in phenomenological modelling (after elimina-\ntion of the polarization dynamics). We would like to point out,\nhowever, that the complex dynamics of the polarization is fully\ntaken into account in the simulations via the Bloch equations [7].\nAs a first example we will consider the absorption regime\nand analyze the dynamics of the susectibility in a dot ensemble\nwhere the carrier distribution is below the transparency level:\nFigs. 3 and 4 show the dynamics of the real (Fig. 3) and imag-\ninary part (Fig. 4) of the susceptibility at the output facet of\nthe amplifier during the passage of a light pulse.

Relative pulse shift in dependence on input pulse energy for different\ncurrents. (a) Results of the numerical modelling. (b) Experimental results.\nintradot scattering (from higher energy states) and carrier cap-\nture from the wetting layer states lead to characteristic modula-\ntions, i.e., scattering effects dominate the behaviour (leading to\nsingularities). For high input pulse energy the propagating light\npulse induces a strong level hole-burning leading to a a charac-\nteristic rise in the spatial index and gain [Figs. 5(b) and 6(b)].\nAs a consequence the carrier dynamics is not entirely relaxed\nafter the passage of the pulse and the duration of the gain and\nindex changes significantly exceeds the duration of the pulse.\nThe observed effects can be explained and summarized as\nfollows.\n1) The complex carrier dynamics that is typical for spatially\ninhomogeneous QD ensemble leads to dynamic changes in\ngain and index that do not necessarily display the typical\nresonance-like behavior but generally show a complex gain\ndynamics and distorted index dispersion. This originates\nfrom the difference in the timescales on which the physical\nprocesses take place: Ultrafast (fs.ps) carrier and carrier-\nphonon scattering processes within the dots, propagation of\nthe light pulse (ps regime) and slow re-establishment of the\nspatial inversion due to the injection current (ns regime).\n2) The observed gain and index dynamics is a consequence of\nthe dynamic space-dependent light-matter interactions that\ntake place during the propagation.\n3) The spatiotemporally varying gain and index reveal the\nreasons for changes in the propagation times: Reshaping\nof the gain (i.e., saturation) induces a shift of the pulse\ncenter leading to a propagation time that will depend on\ncurrent and power. Reshaping of the index leads to velocity\nchanges and to the generation of new frequencies within\nthe pulse shape. Both effects affect the propagation time.\nIt is this complex interplay of index dispersion and gain dy-\nnamics that is responsible for the passage time (dynamic accel-\neration and slow-down) and dynamic shaping of the propagating\nlight pulse which will be discussed in the next section.\nIV. SELF-INDUCED PROPAGATION CONTROL\nIn a next step, we systematically vary the input pulse en-\nergy and injection current and calculate the pulse shift. The re-\nsults of the simulations are summarized in Fig. 7(a) and com-\nFig. 8. Calculated and experimental pulse shapes after propagation in the QD\nSOA.

(c)\u2013(d) Experimental cross-correlation traces of the pulse\nafter propagation in the SOA with a 170 fs (FWHM) Gaussian pulse travelling\noutside the laser. Note that the experimental traces are wider than the theoretical\nones because they are convolutions of the SOA pulse and an external one.\npared to earlier reported [4] experimental results obtained with\nthe pump-probe setup Fig. 7(b). The theoretical results are in\ngood agreement with the experiment. The pulse shift is consid-\nered relative to its position in the unsaturated device and calcu-\nlated relative to the pulse duration (180 fs). Please note that a\nlogarithmic scale has been chosen for the input energy. In the\namplification regime (i.e., at injection currents larger than the\ntransparency current of 15 mA) a gradual relative pulse acceler-\nation of up to 20% (corresponding to an absolute value of 36 fs)\nis reached with increasing pulse energy. Near saturation, the\nleading edge of the propagating light pulse induces a dynamic\nlevel hole-burning in the charge carrier system leading to a re-\nduction of the gain available for the trailing part of the pulse. In\ncombination with the pulse-induced index dispersion this leads\nto a pulse acceleration, i.e., a positive pulse shift. For pulse en-\nergies significantly beyond the saturation energy the pulse shift\ndecreases. In this regime the level occupation is already entirely\ndepleted by the very front part of the pulse. In the absorption\nregime the sign of the relative pulse shift changes and relative\npulse shifts of up to 40% (corresponding to an absolute value of\n72 fs) are obtained. In this case an increase in pulse energy leads\nto a bleaching of the absorption by the rising edge of the pulse\nleading to a reduced absorption for the trailing pulse part. The\nmaximum pulse shift is larger than in the amplification regime.\nThis originates from the partial gain recovery due to intradot re-\nlaxation that is typical for QD lasers below transparency [10]. In\n[4] it was shown how salient features of the observed self-slow-\ndown or speed up can be explained with a gain saturation model.\nHere, we demonstrate (using a spatially and temporally resolved\nMaxwell\u2013Bloch approach) that it is the (spatially varying) inter-\nplay of both, coherent gain and index dynamics as well as inco-\nherent scattering that affects the propagation time and shape of\na light pulse passing a QD laser amplifier.\nV. DYNAMIC PULSE SHAPING\nThe dynamics of gain and index discussed in Section IV is not\nonly responsible for a dynamic acceleration or slow-down of the\npulse but also affects its shape.

In the amplification regime, a\ntypical temporal asymmetry can be seen near saturation, in ad-\ndition to the temporal shift of the pulse center that has already\nbeen discussed in the previous section. Similarly, the complex\ngain and index dynamics lead to corresponding changes in the\npulse shape in the absorption regime. The absolute value of the\ntemporal shift of the pulse center in both the amplification and\nthe absorption regime, is strongly influenced by the depletion\nand generation of carriers by the propagating light pulse. How-\never, an additional influence due to incoherent scattering pro-\ncesses such as, for example, intradot carrier relaxation via emis-\nsion and absorption of phonons occurs. Basically, these effects\nlead to two changes in the spatiotemporal dynamics during pulse\npropagation: First, the dynamic exchange of carriers between\ndifferent levels via emission and absorption of phonons leads to\na rather uniform depletion of all levels whereas a more selec-\ntive depletion of individual levels (with highest dipole matrix\nelements and level energies in resonance with the pulse energy)\nwould occur in a decoupled system [10]. As a consequence, sat-\nuration in a dot system with decoupled levels is already reached\nfor smaller pulse energies. Secondly, the complex scattering dy-\nnamics is\u2014via the QD Bloch equations\u2014directly related to cor-\nresponding changes in the dipole dynamics entering the wave\nequations. As a result, changes in the level occupations are di-\nrectly transferred to the light field dynamics. The coupling of\nspectral with spatiotemporal degrees of freedom realized by\nthe mutual interplay of (intradot and dot-to-wetting layer) scat-\ntering, light propagation, diffusion and spatiotemporal gain and\nindex dynamics then leads to a dynamic reshaping of the pulse.\nThis is particularly pronounced in the ultrashort time regime\nand near transparency where a comparable number of filled and\nempty states coexist leading to a strong level dynamics.\nIn order to visualize the influence of dynamic scattering pro-\ncesses we have calculated the pulse shape in the absorption\nregime at the output facet of our QD laser and\ncompared it with the pulse shape evolution in a QD laser device\nwith decoupled dot levels, i.e., where the dot levels are sepa-\nrated by more than the LO phonon energy so that emission and\nabsorption of phonons is negligible. The resulting pulse shape of\nthe decoupled system, displayed in Fig. 9(a), is characterized by\na comparatively smooth pulse envelope. In contrast, the shape of\na light pulse after the passage in the dot ensemble with coupled\nenergy levels Fig. 9(b) shows a completely different behavior:\nIn this system, the transfer of carrier scattering processes to the\npropagating light field dynamics induces a complex reshaping\nof the light pulses. This is particularly pronounced in the trailing\npart of the light pulse where a complex carrier relaxation occurs\nin response to the pulse excitation.\nVI. PUMP-PROBE PROPAGATION CONTROL\nThe dynamic shaping of gain and index distributions induced\nby a propagating light pulse directly leads to the idea of a pump-\nprobe set-up: In this configuration the injection of a high-energy\npump pulse should allow the control of the propagation time of\nFig. 9. Spatially resolved pulse shapes at the output facet (E = 0:5E ) in a\nQD laser with (a) decoupled dot levels and in a QD laser with energy levels that\ncoupled by (b) dynamic carrier-phonon relaxation processes.\nFig. 10.

Right axis: independently\nmeasured small signal gain of pulse.\nthe probe pulse. In a next step we thus consider the propagation\nof a pulse in a QD ensemble that has been modified by a pre-\nceding pump pulse. The energy of the pump pulse is near the\nsaturation energy of the amplifier, the input energy of the probe\npulse lies in the small signal regime. The duration of the two\npulses is 170 fs and their wavelength is 1273 nm. During the\npropagation in the QD medium the probe pulse interacts with a\ncarrier distribution that has been excited by the pump pulse. By\nvarying the delay between the two pulses or the injection cur-\nrent in the QD laser it should thus be possible to tune the delay\nof the probe pulse. Fig. 10 shows the calculated and measured\npump-induced delay of the probe pulse in dependence on in-\njection current for a zero delay between pump and probe pulse.\nThe theory is in good agreement with the experimentally ob-\ntained results: At 0 mA a maximum relative delay of 12% is\nobtained corresponding to an absolute delay of 20 fs. With in-\ncreasing current the delay is reduced and changes its sign. The\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 06:52 from IEEE Xplore.

Right axis: independently\nmeasured differential gain of a weak pulse following a strong pulse.\nresults can be interpreted in analogy to the results obtained for\nthe single-pulse configuration: The excited carrier system in-\nduced by the pump pulse leads to corresponding gain and index\ndistributions (see also Figs. 3\u20136). For low injection currents the\nprobe pulse interacts with almost empty dots leading to carrier\naccumulation. The resulting gain dynamics and index disper-\nsion then results in a delay of the probe pulse. With increasing\ninjection current the dots of the amplifier are significantly filled\nbefore the passage of the pulses. As a consequence, a dynamic\nlevel hole-burning arises leading to a speed up of the propa-\ngating probe pulse. For a given value of the probe energy the\ninjection current consequently can be used to tune the relative\nshift experienced by the probe pulse. A second control param-\neter is given by the pump-probe delay: After their excitation the\ncarriers relax via intradot scattering and carrier capture towards\ntheir quasi-equilibrium distributions. This relaxation dynamics\ntypically occurs on a picosecond time scale. The gain and index\ndynamics and the resulting delay experienced by the probe pulse\nconsequently depend on the time between the carrier excitation\n(induced by the pump pulse) and the passage of the probe pulse.\nFig. 11 summarizes the numerical and experimental results on\nthe dependence of the relative pulse shift on pump-probe delay.\nThe injection current has been set to zero. The measured de-\npendence of the pulse shift on the pump-probe delay is quali-\ntatively confirmed by the theoretical curve. The reason for the\nslightly faster decay seen in the simulated results is associated\nto uncertainties in some of the material parameters such as, e.g.,\ndisorder in the dot distribution. If the pump pulse is behind the\nprobe pulse the probe pulse does not experience the modifica-\ntions in the carrier system generated by the probe pulse and the\nrelative pulse delay equals zero. At zero delay between pump\nand probe pulse a maximum relative delay of 12% of the probe\npulse (corresponding to an absolute value of 34 fs) is obtained.\nWith increasing pump-probe delay the probe pulse experiences\nthe gain dynamics and index dispersion of the partially relaxed\ncarrier system leading to a characteristic decrease of the relative\npulse shift.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nWe have investigated the propagation time of ultrashort\nlight pulses in QD semiconductor optical amplifiers. A theo-\nretical analysis on the basis of spatiotemporally resolved QD\nMaxwell\u2013Bloch equations revealed a complex interplay of\ngain and index dynamics that affect the propagation time and\ndynamically shape the light pulse during its propagation. It\ncould be demonstrated that the delay of the emitted light pulse\nstrongly depends on injection current and input pulse energy.\nIn the amplification regime, an acceleration of the pulse of up\nto 20% of its duration has been obtained for sufficiently high\ninput pulse energy values whereas a significant slow down\nof 40% could be observed in absorption. The computational\nresults was in good agreement with experimental pump-probe\nmeasurements. The theoretical analysis revealed that it is the\ninterplay of both, coherent light\u2013matter coupling and inco-\nherent scattering processes such as carrier capture and intradot\ncarrier\u2014phonon interactions that affect the ultrashort carrier\ndynamics and consequently the gain and index dynamics in the\namplifier. As a result, the propagation time and, in particular,\nthe shape of a light pulse after its passage in the QD amplifier\nare determined by spatiospectral gain saturation, index dy-\nnamics and ultrafast carrier scattering. Our computational and\nexperimental results clearly indicate the potential of QD semi-\nconductor optical amplifiers for a speed control of ultrashort\nhigh-bandwidth light pulses. Such functionality can provide\nfine-tuning of pulse time position which is important in e.g.,\noptical time domain multiplexing (OTDM) systems.\nAPPENDIX\nQD MAXWELL\u2013BLOCH EQUATIONS\nThe spatially resolved QD Maxwell\u2013Bloch equations de-\nscribe the spatiotemporal light field and inter\/intralevel carrier\ndynamics in each dot of a typical QD ensemble in QD lasers.\nStarting from the quantum kinetic equations of motion of the\nsingle particle density matrices with respect to the carrier\u2013\nphonon Hamiltonian, factorizing the intraband and interlevel ma-\ntrices into single-particle density matrices and using the Markov\napproximation (i.e., assuming slowly varying distributions) one\nobtains the following equations for the dynamics of the occupa-\ntion of electrons ( , level index ) and holes ( level index ), ,\nand the dynamics of the interlevel polarizations (coupled to\nthe forward and backward propagating optical fields)\n(1)\nrepresents the rate due to nonradiative recombination and\ndenotes the dephasing rate of the interlevel dipole.

The last terms in (1) describe scattering processes\nsuch as e.g., emission and absorption of phonons (approximated\nby their quasi-equilibrium distribution) and carrier scattering to\nwetting layer that are dynamically included on a mesoscopic\nlevel. The dynamics of the carriers in the surrounding wetting\nlayer of the dots is described with a diffusion equation [7]. The\nmaterial properties of the QD ensemble (dipole matrix elements\nand energy levels) are considered via effective parameters [16].\nSpatial fluctuations in material properties (dot size, level en-\nergies, dot distribution) are taken into account via a space de-\npendent parameter set. Via the generation rate and the dipole\ndynamics at each location in the laser structure the carrier dy-\nnamics is fundamentally linked to the light field dynamics that\nis described by the wave equation\n(2)\nwhere the polarization of the active semiconductor medium,\nis the source of the optical fields. At every\ngrid point and for each time step, the physical quantities are cal-\nculated on the basis of finite difference methods (on a numerical\ngrid with regular mesh-size) using the Hopscotch [19] method\nas a general scheme. Typical grid sizes are a few microns, the\nstep for the integration in time is in the regime 0.5\u20131 fs.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank A.
