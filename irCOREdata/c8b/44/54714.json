Seventy-nine participants (9-18 years old) from 26 sports participated in 4 \nsemi-structured focus-groups investigating how coaches, parents, and peers may influence motivation. 5 \nUsing a critical-realist perspective, an inductive content-analysis indicated that specializing athletes 6 \nperceived a multitude of motivationally-relevant social cues. Coaches\u2019 and parents\u2019 influences were 7 \nrelated to their specific roles: instruction\/assessment for coaches, support-and-facilitation for parents. 8 \nPeers influenced motivation through competitive behaviors, collaborative behaviors, evaluative 9 \ncommunications, and through their social relationships. The results help to delineate different roles for 10 \nsocial agents in influencing athletes' motivation. 11 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     3 \nThe Motivational Atmosphere in Youth Sport: Coach, Parent, and Peer Influences on Motivation in 1 \nSpecializing Sport Participants 2 \nMotivation in sport is the key determinant behind every action taken and every effort exerted (or 3 \nnot) (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Understanding the dynamics of motivated behavior in sport is arguably vital. 4 \nAlthough important aspects of individuals\u2019 motivations are determined by their own beliefs, cognitions, 5 \nand values, significant influences can also be exerted by key social agents (Deci & Ryan, 2000). It is 6 \nthese social influences that form the focus of this study. Over the last 25 years, a considerable volume 7 \nof research has been generated attempting to conceptualize and measure these influences, particularly 8 \nfrom coaches (for a review see Harwood, Spray, & Keegan, 2008). In the current study, a broader focus 9 \nwas adopted, examining the wide array of potential motivational influences originating from coaches, 10 \nparents, and peers. The term motivational atmosphere was chosen to reflect this broader, more detailed 11 \ndescription.  12 \nAthletic Career Progression 13 \nBoth C\u00f4t\u00e9, Baker, and Abernethy (2003) and Wylleman, Alfermann, and Lavallee (2004) 14 \nproposed models of athletic career progression. In each case, the early career is characterized by 15 \nparticipants who are generally prompted to try a number of different sports to see if they either enjoy 16 \nthem, have some talent, or perhaps both. This period is termed the initiation\/sampling stage (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 17 \n2003; Wylleman et al., 2004). Following this period, athletes tend to focus on one or two sports in 18 \nwhich they specialize, learning the key skills, tactics, and rules. This specializing phase tends to occur 19 \nfrom around the age of 11-12 years. Athletes at this stage have three possible outcomes: they can seek 20 \nto invest and develop into elite performers, compete at a recreational level, or retire from the sport. The 21 \nnext developmental stage is termed investment \/ mastery (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003; Wylleman et al.) and can 22 \nbegin from approximately 15 years of age, depending on the sport. This stage can either be considered 23 \nto continue until retirement (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003), or it can take the performer to a state of maintenance 24 \n(Wylleman et al.). The specializing career stage is difficult to delineate with any precision, because it is 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     4 \ncharacterized by change. These changes include: a) decreasing number of sports\/activities b) a decrease 1 \nin deliberate play, being replaced with deliberate practice, and c) gradual changes in the roles of 2 \ncoaches (from \u2018helper\u2019 to \u2018specialist\u2019), parents (from direct\u2019 to \u2018indirect\u2019 involvement), and peers (from 3 \nstimulation\/co-participation towards the fulfillment of emotional needs - C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003). In contrast, 4 \nthe investment\/mastery stage is defined by a heavy and exclusive focus on deliberate practice, specialist 5 \ncoaching in a single sport, and markedly decreased parental involvement (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003). This paper 6 \naddresses the specializing stage of development.  7 \nMotivational Climate Research 8 \nWithin achievement goal theory (AGT; Nicholls, 1989), sport participants\u2019 immediate goals for 9 \nachievement are determined by the interaction of their goal orientation (a proneness in individuals 10 \ntowards adopting certain goals) with the situational goal climate (the specific situational and contextual 11 \ncircumstances in which the achievement task is defined; Ames, 1992). The dichotomous AGT approach 12 \nproposed by Nicholls defines these goals in one of two ways: performance\/ego goals emphasize 13 \nnormative evaluations and outperforming others, and mastery\/task goals emphasize effort, personal 14 \nimprovement, and task mastery. The presence of task goals has almost invariably been associated with 15 \npositive motivational outcomes, whereas the presence of ego goals is hypothesized to produce an array 16 \nof less desirable outcomes, especially when perceived competence is low, or where not accompanied 17 \nby task goals. Nevertheless, results regarding the adoption of performance\/ego goals have been 18 \nsomewhat inconsistent (for reviews, see Elliot, 1999; Harwood et al., 2008).  19 \nTheoretical and empirical research has led to the development of the TARGET acronym, 20 \noutlining the ways in which teachers and coaches can emphasize achievement goals: task, authority, 21 \nrecognition, grouping, evaluation, and timing (Ames, 1992). A task-climate would include 22 \ncollaborative tasks, democratic leadership, recognition for effort\/improvement, mixed ability 23 \ngroupings, private and individual evaluation, and sufficient time for everyone to learn. An ego-climate 24 \nwould include competitive tasks, autocratic leadership, recognition of normative ability, segregation by 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     5 \nability, normative and public evaluation, and time for only the more advanced students to complete a 1 \ntask. In most coaching environments, however, the above behaviors are likely to occur interchangeably 2 \ndepending on the circumstances. Extensive questionnaire-based research has revealed that a perceived 3 \nmastery climate correlates with positive outcomes, whereas perceptions of a performance climate either 4 \nshow no such relationships, or correlate with negative outcomes (e.g. anxiety and tension, reduced 5 \nenjoyment; see Harwood et al., 2008 for a review). Given such a compelling body of research, 6 \nrelatively consistent findings and such a parsimonious theoretical model, it may not be surprising that 7 \nAGT has dominated research for over 20 years. Nevertheless, can something as complex as the ever-8 \nchanging social milieu in which developing players participate be comprehensively represented by 9 \nsuch a parsimonious model?  10 \nStepping Beyond Motivational Climate 11 \nWithin self-determination theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2000), competence, autonomy, and 12 \nrelatedness are conceptualized to be core psychological needs. SDT denotes that the degree to which 13 \nany context, situation or relationship supports these needs would directly predict an athlete\u2019s level of 14 \nmotivation. Although AGT chiefly concerns the pursuit of competence (Roberts, 2001), Stuntz and 15 \nWeiss (2002) argued that sport is often highly public and therefore inherently linked with social 16 \nconsiderations, so that athletes\u2019 perceptions of physical competence may well be intertwined with 17 \ncertain socially-oriented motives. Allen (2003) proposed a theory of social motivation in sport that 18 \nfocuses upon an athlete\u2019s desire for social competence in achievement settings, defined in terms of the 19 \nforming of friendships, gaining social status and recognition, and the perception of belonging to a 20 \ngroup (see also Ullrich-French & Smith, 2006). Urdan and Maehr (1995) called for the reconsideration 21 \nof social goal orientations (after their initial inclusion in AGT) in describing and explaining 22 \nachievement behavior. Historically, social goals may include social welfare goals (i.e., to benefit the 23 \nlarger society), social responsibility (i.e., to be conscientious), social affiliation (i.e., to feel a sense of 24 \nbelonging), and social status goals (Urdan & Maehr, 1995; Wentzel, 1993).  25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     6 \nThe story becomes more complex when it comes to the joint consideration of these various 1 \ntheories. AGT is sometimes taken to overarch all of the above theoretical standpoints such that in 2 \nVazou, Ntoumanis, and Duda\u2019s (2005) study, themes consistent with relatedness and autonomy 3 \nconsiderations (from SDT) were deductively subsumed into the conceptualization of a task-involving 4 \nclimate. This assumption arguably overlooked the possibility that these themes might be related to both 5 \ntask- and ego-involving climates. The difference between achievement goals and social goals is also an 6 \narea of tension, with some theorists preferring to subsume social goals into the ego-goal conception 7 \n(Roberts, 2001), whereas Urdan and Maehr (1995) argued that the separate consideration of social 8 \ngoals significantly increases understanding and predictive power. Elliot (1999), however, proposed that 9 \nAGT should be limited to an exclusive focus on competence, excluding any consideration of self 10 \npresentational or social status concerns. Despite this dissonance, there is also some convergence. All of 11 \nthese theories of motivational regulation have been linked with differences in levels of self-reported 12 \nintrinsic\/extrinsic motivation (Barkoukis, Th\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani, Ntoumanis, & Nikitaras, 2007; 13 \nKavussanu & Roberts, 1996; Smith, Ullrich-French, Walker, & Hurley, 2006) and, despite the 14 \ndominance of AGT in investigating the motivational climate, research adopting other theories has 15 \nfrequently and fruitfully addressed interpersonal and social considerations, such as relationships 16 \n(Mageau & Vallerand, 2003; Ullrich-French & Smith, 2006), autonomy support (Conroy & 17 \nCoatsworth, 2007; Gurland & Grolnick, 2005; Pelletier, Fortier, Vallerand, & Br\u00ecere, 2002), peer-18 \nfriendships and group considerations (Allen, 2003; Weiss, Smith, & Theeboom, 1996), and the 19 \nemphasis of approach-or-avoidance motivation by significant others (Barkousis et al., 2007; Church, 20 \nElliot, & Gable, 2001; Elliot, 1999).  21 \nThe above points reinforce the need to investigate the motivational atmosphere without an a-22 \npriori commitment to using one-or-another model of motivation to guide analysis and\/or interpretation. 23 \nAll the theories described here, as well as their various derivations\/combinations, are arguably relevant 24 \nto the study of social and environmental motivational processes. The critical-realist approach adopted 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     7 \nin this study denotes that none of these competing theories should be given any preference, especially 1 \nprior to engagement with the subject matter: a kind of \u2018theoretical agnosticism\u2019 advocated by Henwood 2 \nand Pidgeon (2003). This absence of a guiding theory is best understood as an open mind rather than an 3 \nempty head (see also Sandelowski, 1993).  4 \nDeconstructing Motivational Climate 5 \nAs already noted, recent studies have started to examine the social and environmental influences 6 \non motivation without exclusively focusing on the AGT conception of motivational climate. These 7 \nstudies suggest researchers should incorporate a multifaceted approach to progress our understanding, 8 \neven calling for a \u2018deconstruction\u2019 of what constitutes the motivational climate (Amorose, 2007; Smith, 9 \nSmoll, & Cumming, 2007). This shift has occurred in recognition of the idea that the specific behaviors 10 \nof coaches, parents, and peers each influence athletes\u2019 motivation, and that these behaviors may have 11 \ndifferent influences between contexts, situations, and developmental levels. Keegan, Harwood, Spray, 12 \nand Lavallee (2009) identified specific aspects of coach, parent, and peer behavior that sampling 13 \n(initiation) athletes reported to be motivationally-relevant. Their data suggested that first, young 14 \nparticipants were quite aware of how these social agents affected their motivation, and second, there 15 \nwas a vast array of behaviors and interactions that were reported to be motivationally-relevant. 16 \nProminent in their findings was the idea that the influences of social agents were related to the specific 17 \nroles they fulfill (teaching, supporting, co-operating). The analysis indicated that the way coaches 18 \ninfluence motivation related most strongly to the manner in which they perform their roles of 19 \ninstruction and assessment, whereas parents\u2019 influences were most salient in terms of the way they 20 \nsupported participation and learning. Parents and coaches were reported to be influential in terms of 21 \ntheir leadership styles, affective responses, and pre-performance behaviors. Where coaches and parents 22 \nperformed different roles (e.g., coaches teaching, parents supporting), their sources of influence differed 23 \ntoo. Peers were perceived to influence motivation via competitive behaviors, collaborative behaviors, 24 \nevaluative communication, and through social relationships (Keegan et al., 2009). With specific regard 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     8 \nto specializing athletes, Vazou et al. (2005) identified a wide array of peer interactions that could be 1 \nviewed as motivationally relevant. When the findings of Vazou et al. are considered alongside other 2 \nsimilar studies (e.g., Beltman & Volet, 2007; Garcia-Bengoechea & Strean, 2007; Weiss et al., 1996), 3 \nan initial overview emerges of ways that peers reportedly influence each other\u2019s motivation, including: 4 \nemphasizing effort, emphasizing competition, collaboration, evaluative comments, conflict (and its 5 \nresolution\/absence), emotional\/moral support, and friendships\/group-membership. Likewise, recent 6 \nstudies have examined the roles of parents in more detail, identifying such behaviors as additional 7 \ncoaching\/instruction, feedback, emotional responses, autonomy support, controlling behaviors, 8 \nmaintaining focus, and social support (Gould, Lauer, Rolo, Jannes, & Pennisi, 2008; Holt, Black, 9 \nTamminen, Mandigo, & Fox, 2008; Holt, Tamminen, Black, Mandigo, & Fox, 2009), as well as the 10 \n\u2018conditionality\u2019 of support ( i.e., whether parents emphasize a return for their investment or assure the 11 \nathletes that their support is unconditional; Assor, Roth, & Deci, 2004; Gould et al., 2008). These 12 \nexploratory studies would appear to facilitate the dismantling of the socio-environmental influences on 13 \nmotivation, which was called for by Amorose (2007) and Smith et al. (2007). What is missing from this 14 \nresearch is a comprehensive and integrated description of the behaviors\/interactions that athletes 15 \nperceive to influence their motivation. Given the pivotal importance of the specializing career stage in 16 \nboth producing elite athletes and maintaining active and healthy lifestyles, this study set out to identify 17 \nthose behaviors of coaches, parents, and peers that specializing athletes perceive to be motivationally 18 \nrelevant.  19 \nMethod 20 \nParticipants 21 \nFollowing ethical clearance from a British university, 12 focus group interviews were conducted 22 \ncontaining 79 sport participants (36 females and 43 males), recruited from 26 sports with an age range 23 \nfrom 9.0 years up to 18.16 years (M = 12.93, SD = 1.82). Seventy-seven of the participants were White 24 \nEuropean, one was of Asian, and one was of African descent. The participants were recruited from two 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     9 \nlocal schools and one premiership soccer academy. In each case, the head teacher, director, or instructor 1 \nwas contacted by letter explaining the study and requesting permission to interview participants. In the 2 \ncase of the secondary schools, students were requested to take part if they played sport in their spare 3 \ntime, outside of school PE. Participants under the age of 18 (n = 78) took a parental consent form home 4 \nand, if consent was granted, they were taken out of class\/practice and interviewed nearby. Sport 5 \nexperience ranged from those with 2-3 years experience up to and including 5-6 years experience. 6 \nForty-two participants were competing in a single sport, 22 competed in two, and 15 reported 7 \ncompeting in three or more sports.  8 \nUsing C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al.\u2019s (2003) model of career development, a maximum variability theoretical 9 \nsample (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) of specializing athletes was sought with the following criteria in mind: 10 \na) career length (in main sport) over 2-3 years, b) beginning to focus on one\/two main sports outside of 11 \nschool PE, and c) training regularly (e.g., deliberate practice at least once a week during the sporting 12 \nseason). Although specializers are characteristically 11-16 years of age, this criterion was interpreted 13 \nflexibly, such that 10 year olds training 2-3 times a week at a premiership academy appeared in the 14 \nsame sample as 18 year olds playing hockey twice a week at their local club. This sample not only 15 \nreflected the changing and varied characteristics of specializing athletes, but it gave a voice to all 16 \nrelevant participants, rather than excluding those who may not have met predetermined selection 17 \ncriteria. Thirteen participants were representing their county, 18 were selected to train with a 18 \npremiership soccer academy, and three had attended trials to represent their country. The remaining 19 \nparticipants were chosen by their schools from a gifted-and-talented register; identifying pupils who 20 \nhad been recognized for their sporting achievement.  21 \nProcedure 22 \nA focus-group approach was chosen to maximize the experience within each group and also to 23 \nmeet child-protection and ethical considerations. Focus groups are proposed to be highly appropriate in 24 \nsituations where the research is aiming to generate new ideas, language, and applications, and they can 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     10 \nalso help to embolden participants to offer their opinions (Greenbaum, 1998). All interviews took place 1 \nat the school or training site and lasted 45-65 minutes. Participants took part under their own volition 2 \nwith no incentive offered by the interviewer. All interviews were conducted by the first author. A semi-3 \nstructured interview guide (taken from Keegan et al., 2009) was deployed although questions changed 4 \nas themes developed between interviews. The interview guide was piloted several months previously 5 \nand given to secondary school teachers who checked that is was developmentally appropriate. These 6 \nprocesses highlighted the importance of flexibility in asking, explaining, and following-up the 7 \nquestions to ensure all group members felt able to contribute. After a brief introduction and ice-8 \nbreaking exercise, the main questions were intended to assess the influences (positive and negative) of 9 \ncoaches, parents, and peers on motivated behaviors; including effort, persistence, task choice, focus, 10 \nand enjoyment (cf. Roberts, 2001). Sample questions included: \u201cWhat things can your 11 \n[coach\/parents\/team-mates] do, or say that influence how much you [want to play sport \/ want to try 12 \nhard in your sport \/ enjoy your sport \/ focus on learning new skills \/ help you to keep trying, even when 13 \nyou\u2019re struggling]?\u201d The interview finished with some summary questions such as: \u201cIf you could write 14 \na wish-list saying: \u2018To make me [come back every week \/ try my hardest all the time \/ really enjoy my 15 \nsport] this is how you should be\u2019: What sort of things would go on that list?\u201d and \u201cWhat things should 16 \ndefinitely be off that list?\u201d The interview proceeded differently every time in response to the 17 \ndiscussions and debates between participants. Participants were always encouraged to seek clarification 18 \nif they were unsure. The sections relating to coaches, parents, and peers were asked in a 19 \ncounterbalanced order between interviews to alleviate any effects of fatigue or boredom. Additionally, 20 \nwhen addressing the influence of coaches, participants were instructed to focus on their coaches from 21 \norganized sport and not their school teachers. 22 \nParticipants were allowed to respond freely and debates were encouraged when participants had 23 \ndifferent perspectives. If questions intended for later in the interview were discussed this variation was 24 \nalso permitted. Probes were included to explore or focus on themes and questions-of-interest that arose 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     11 \nduring or between interviews. Thus, while the interview was structured, there was flexibility in how 1 \nquestions were asked and followed up, allowing a greater depth of exploration and improved rapport. 2 \nData Analysis 3 \nThe process of data analysis started after the first interview was completed, with the interviewer 4 \nreflecting on the responses given and sharing these reflections with the co-investigators, often arriving 5 \nat new themes to explore. As a result of this process, the data gathered became increasingly focused 6 \naround emerging themes and questions. The same eight-step procedure adopted by Keegan et al. (2009) 7 \nwas implemented to prepare and analyze the data: 1) transcribe interviews verbatim (yielding 358 8 \npages of single spaced text), 2) read and re-read transcripts for familiarization (also listening to tapes), 9 \n3) divide quotes into those concerning coaches, parents, and peers, 4) perform a thorough inductive 10 \ncontent analysis, moving recursively between creating tags (\u201copen coding\u201d), creating categories 11 \n(\u201cfocused coding\u201d), and organizing categories, using constant comparison and critical reflection to 12 \nguide analysis (cf. C\u00f4t\u00e9, Salmela, Baria, & Russell, 1993) within each domain using QSR N-Vivo 13 \nversion 7 qualitative analysis software (QSR, 2006), 5) inter-rater checking of the coding in a sample of 14 \nmanuscripts (>80% agreement; cf. LeCompte & Goetz, 1982), 6) member checking via both internal 15 \n(checking understanding during focus groups and returning scripts to ensure statements had not been 16 \nmisrepresented) and external (recruiting a new group of specializing participants to assess\/discuss the 17 \nfindings) processes; 7) an iterative consensus validation process was conducted with two members of 18 \nthe research team to question codings, categorizations, and the overall organization of the data, and 8) a 19 \npeer debrief (cf. Lincoln & Guba, 1985) was conducted with the remaining researcher throughout the 20 \nanalysis as well as in review of the final analysis. Within the analysis process, all identified codes 21 \nrepresented the interpreted meanings of the athletes\u2019 responses. The processes of private reflection, 22 \nconsensus validation, and peer review were used to ensure that: a) code and category labels were 23 \nrepresented in the data and not 'forced' upon it (cf. Charmaz, 2006), and b) the theoretical agnosticism, 24 \ndescribed in the introduction, was retained because each quote\/theme\/category was compared in 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     12 \nrelation to both other data (i.e., constant comparison; Lincoln & Guba, 1985) and all of the potential 1 \ntheoretical standpoints. Existing conceptions were forced to \u201cearn\u201d their way into the analysis rather 2 \nthan \u201cguiding\u201d it (cf. Charmaz, 2006, p.68).  3 \nThe iterative and recursive coding of properties, interactions, and contexts\/situations (processes) 4 \nwas carried out until no new information about a category emerged. The analysis focused on 5 \nmotivationally-relevant sources and forms of perceived influence. The most salient outcome of the 6 \nanalysis was the perception that \u201cthe motivational atmosphere is complicated\u201d. This perception led to 7 \nan analysis prioritizing breadth over depth in an attempt to identify as many contributing variables as 8 \npossible. Space considerations prevent the full presentation of quotes and illustrations, but in an attempt 9 \nto demonstrate the transparency and authenticity of the research, numerous quotes are presented and 10 \nexplicit links are made between the interpretive account and the findings of other related studies (cf. 11 \nPawson & Tilley, 1997).  12 \nResults and Preliminary Discussion 13 \nWith a view to highlighting the potential integration of coach, parent, and peer influences, Figures 14 \n1 and 2 were constructed to highlight higher-order themes that showed strong correspondence between 15 \nsocial agents. The results list congruent themes that related to all three social agents, then themes that 16 \nshowed similarities among any two social agents, and finally, the themes that appeared unique to one 17 \nsocial agent. Where quotations are provided within the text, the participant\u2019s reference is given in the 18 \nform [GENDER-AGE-SPORTS]. To provide a full and complete representation of the findings, while 19 \nsimultaneously attempting to offer sufficient explanation, all categories and themes that emerged from 20 \nthe analysis are presented in the figures, and (where appropriate) discussed in relation to existing 21 \nresearch. These findings do not represent an attempt to generate a new theory, but rather they provide 22 \nthe fullest possible account of the motivationally-relevant indices in the \u2018motivational atmosphere\u2019, 23 \nsuch that subsequent theorizing may (eventually) be facilitated.  24 \nCoach, Parent, and Peer Commonalities 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     13 \nThe concept of feedback or evaluative communication emerged separately in all three dimensions 1 \nof the analysis (see Figure 1). Overall, both coaches and parents were reported to influence the 2 \nmotivation of athletes through either verbal feedback or behavioral reinforcement. Verbal feedback 3 \ncould vary in terms of its valence (praise-criticism) and its constructiveness. Positive feedback was 4 \ngenerally viewed as producing more adaptive forms of motivation, whereas negative feedback was 5 \nmore likely to undermine motivation, produce frustration, or even undermine the athlete's relationship 6 \nwith the feedback provider. \u201cIf you're really upset that you've done badly, and you really want to 7 \nimprove on it, and they just like point it out and make it even worse like, by shouting at you... when 8 \nyou know already\u201d [M-13-SOCCER]. In contrast, however, negative feedback was also reported as 9 \nproducing an I\u2019ll show him response, for example: \u201cIt\u2019s not very nice when they criticize you but that 10 \nmakes you like [think] \u2018I\u2019m gonna show them that I can actually do that... I\u2019ll be better\u2019\u201d [M10-SOCCER 11 \nACADEMY]. 12 \nA cluster of ideas was identified relating to Dweck\u2019s (1999) model with ability being conceived 13 \nas fixed (entity) or malleable (incremental). Constructive feedback was seen in positive terms, linking 14 \nwith an incremental conception of ability, whereas summative feedback was linked with feelings of 15 \nfrustration and undermined motivation, invoking as it did, an entity conception of ability: 16 \n[Mum]'s like 'no you weren't good enough'... But then I feel like 'well I've tried my hardest, 17 \nand I can't do any better than that'. But then if my dad was there he'd be like 'you did really 18 \nwell in them matches,\u2019 like \u2018concentrate on getting your skills right\u2019. It would make me feel a 19 \nlot better that he was like trying to help me, rather than just telling me what I'm doing wrong. 20 \n[F-12-HOCKEY] 21 \nCoaches and parents were also reported to influence motivation by using behavioral 22 \nreinforcement (rewards and punishments) in response to performances, outcomes, and effort\/attitude. 23 \nFor example: \u201cIf he like failed they just grounded him and stuff like that.... Like once he just missed out 24 \non getting selected but his mum and dad just went mental\u201d [M-12-HOCKEY\/LACROSSE]. In contrast, parents 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     14 \nwere also reported to offer 'unconditional praise', which was seen as a positive influence on motivation 1 \nand the parent-child relationship, for example: \u201cEven when it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re not gonna win they 2 \nsay \u2018Do your best, carry on. Don\u2019t give up!\u201d and then afterwards they\u2019re like \u2018Well done! You played 3 \nreally well\u2019, so you feel like you haven\u2019t done so bad\u201d [F-11-SWIM\/NETBALL\/SKI].  4 \nThe nature of feedback and evaluative communication in the peer dimension did seem 5 \nqualitatively different to the coaching and parent dimensions, because it included themes ranging from 6 \ngenuine feedback to momentary displays of frustration or joy. There were two emergent categories: 7 \n\u2018immediate reactions to mistakes\u2019 could be subdivided into \u2018anger and criticism\u2019 and \u2018encouragement 8 \nafter mistakes\u2019 (e.g., \u201cIf I duffed a shot or something, someone would just say \u2018Hard luck, still try and 9 \ndo it next time but do it better\u2019 Instead of just saying \u2018Oh that was rubbish\u2019\u201d [M-13-SOCCER]. The second 10 \nemergent category was labeled \u2018verbal commentary\u2019 and was further subdivided into \u2018praise and 11 \npositive feedback\u2019, and \u2018criticism and negative feedback\u2019. This verbal feedback was evident in both 12 \nVazou et al.\u2019s (2005) and Beltman and Volet\u2019s (2007) studies, and although it may differ qualitatively 13 \nfrom the feedback offered by coaches and parents (less formal and authoritative - hence the label 14 \n\u2018commentary\u2019), it did involve the verbal expression of evaluative information.  15 \nCoach and Parent Commonalities 16 \n Leadership style. Both coaches and parents shared themes of 'controlling style', 'autonomy 17 \nsupportive style', 'expertise', and 'relationship aspects'. Elements of these findings replicate those of 18 \nConroy and Coatsworth (2007 \u2013 regarding coaches) and Holt et al. (2008; 2009 \u2013 regarding parents), 19 \nwhile other findings offer new possible themes. Regarding both coaches and parents, autonomy support 20 \nwas generally reported as having a positive influence on motivation, whereas a controlling style was 21 \noften reported in relation to feelings of frustration, anger, undermined motivation, and even damaging 22 \nrelationships. An autonomy supportive style included showing an interest, listening wherever possible 23 \n(e.g., \u201cThey listen. Like if you've had a bad game, or you want to moan, they actually listen to you and 24 \ndon\u2019t just go 'whatever'\u201d [M-13-SOCCER]), supporting the child\u2019s desires and allowing the athlete to 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     15 \nparticipate in decisions (e.g., \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a party, don\u2019t say \u2018Oh you\u2019re not going to the party cos 1 \nyou\u2019ve got training tonight\u2019. Give them a choice\u201d [F-15-SWIMMING]); whereas controlling style included 2 \nmaking autocratic decisions, asserting control with threats\/pushing (e.g., \u201cHis dad had kept pushing 3 \nhim and pushing him and he got like too hard on him and eventually he dropped out \u2018cos he was just 4 \nfed up of it\u201d [M-13-RUGBY]), and parents trying to influence selection decisions on behalf of their child 5 \n(e.g., \u201cParents asking the manager for them to play, and saying \u2018Why aren\u2019t my kids in the team?\u2019\u201d  [M-6 \n15-RUGBY\/SOCCER\/ROWING]).  7 \nElements of social motivation were apparent in the theme \u2018relationship with athletes\u2019 (coaches 8 \nand parents). The importance of the athlete-coach and athlete-parent relationships was highlighted by 9 \nmany participants and is illustrated by quotes such as \u201cWhen my father\u2019s there... he\u2019s the most 10 \nimportant person in my life as far as I\u2019m concerned, and when he\u2019s there I always play better, I\u2019m 11 \nalways so happy when he\u2019s there\u201d[M17-RUGBY], and \u201cIf you're like inspired by your coach, you want to 12 \ndo it even more;  like do it for them\u2026 But if you've got a horrible coach, you like just don't feel like 13 \n[doing] what they're saying. [M-12-SOCCER\/CRICKET].   In addition, the expertise of both coaches and parents 14 \nseemed to play a role in the motivation of the athlete. This observation may be important because the 15 \nspecializing career stage is partially characterized by a shift towards specialist coaching (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 16 \n2003). With specific regard to the parents, 'different parenting styles\u2019 suggested that parents may have 17 \ndifferent effects on motivation, depending on their relationship with the child, experience of the sport, 18 \nor affective style (see also Holt et al., 2008).  19 \nEmotional and affective responses. These responses were separated from such themes as 20 \n\u2018feedback and evaluation\u2019 because they did not always have an evaluative component, but reflected the 21 \ntendency of the coach\/parent to be moody or easily angered. The emergent categories within this 22 \ndimension included: a) propensity for anger (e.g., [regarding coach] \u201cYou know you've got to perform 23 \nwell otherwise they're gonna like, not be very happy\u201d [M-12-BADMINTON]), b) positive affect (e.g., 24 \n[regarding coach] \u201cIt makes the situation more positive so you feel you can play your best... So it is 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     16 \nhow the coach really puts it, the body language they use as well\u201d [F-14-HOCKEY\/SOCCER]), and c) \u2018tolerance\u2019 1 \n\u2013 which was reflected by acceptance, or the absence of a negative reaction, regarding mistakes and 2 \ndefeats (e.g., \u201cWell my dad, he would never shout, he would just say \u2018you need to improve\u2026you didn\u2019t 3 \ndo this as well today\u2019, he would never shout\u201d [M-10-SOCCER-ACADEMY]). The emotional responses of 4 \ncoaches and parents (real and anticipated) appeared to be a key factor in influencing the participants\u2019 5 \nmotivation. Participants appeared to pursue positive emotional responses, appreciate tolerance, and try 6 \nto avoid producing negative responses, such as anger or sadness. The observed and anticipated 7 \nemotional responses effectively created an emotional climate around sporting involvement, separate 8 \nfrom (but inherently related to) ideas of evaluation, approval, and supportiveness. Studies by Conroy 9 \nand Coatsworth (2007), Holt et al. (2009) and Gould et al. (2008) also alluded to these factors. 10 \n Pre-performance motivating behaviors. This theme represented the behaviors undertaken in the 11 \nperiod immediately before competitive performance with the specific intention of motivating the 12 \nparticipants. Both parents and coaches were cited as being able to promote effort\/mastery (e.g., 13 \n[regarding coach] \u201cBefore the match they tell you exactly what they want you to do... ...they tell you 14 \nexactly what you need to do to be better in that position\u201d [M-13-SWIM\/SOCCER]), pressure\/avoidance 15 \nmotivation (e.g., [regarding coach] \u201cThey\u2019ll say that if you\u2019re not doing your best they\u2019ll bring you off 16 \nand replace you\u2026 \u2026But sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. It puts extra weight on your shoulders.\u201d [M-15-17 \nRUGBY\/SOCCER\/ROWING]), and confidence\/approach motivation. Coaches (but not parents) were cited as 18 \nbeing able to promote competitiveness and intra-team rivalry, as well as passion and energy (e.g., \u201cSay 19 \nwhen you\u2019ve got an important match and your coach is like revved up as well then it makes you like 20 \nwanna try\u201d [M-13-SOCCER\/CRICKET]). Certain elements of this theme have been noted in other recent papers 21 \n(see Figure 1), but overall it may represent a potentially fruitful area for future investigation.  22 \nCoach-specific Themes 23 \nInstruction and pedagogic considerations. This theme referred to the way the coach goes about 24 \nthe regular duties of coaching, such as teaching, planning and implementing drills, and making 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     17 \nselections (see Figure 2). \u2018Equal treatment and perceived fairness\u2019 was further subdivided into \u2018equal 1 \nopportunities in selection\u2019 (i.e., allowing genuine competition for places), \u2018equality in feedback\u2019 (i.e., 2 \ngiving equal time to all players and also being equally positive\/negative with all players), \u2018perceived 3 \nunfairness in selection\u2019 (i.e., always picking favorite players regardless of attendance at training or 4 \nrecent form) and \u2018differential treatment\u2019 (i.e., spending more time or being more friendly with favorite 5 \nplayers, asking a team to always pass the ball to one player). \u2018One-to-one coaching\u2019 related to the time 6 \nspent by coaches giving instruction, attention, evaluation, and feedback individually. This coaching 7 \nbehavior was construed as having a very positive influence on motivation.  8 \n \u2018Task design\u2019 related to all aspects of the drills and practices that coaches organize during their 9 \npractice sessions. Fundamentally, the nature of the tasks that the athletes are asked to undertake was 10 \nreported as having an influence on their motivation. The category was sub-divided into: a) \u2018creating 11 \ncompetitions in practice\u2019, b) \u2018variety and fun\u2019, c) \u2018tasks focusing on results\u2019 (e.g., \u201cSo you aren\u2019t really 12 \nimproving, you\u2019re just kind of looking to win the match and that\u2019s it... they all want to score goals but 13 \nwhen we\u2019re under pressure we can\u2019t tackle\u201d [M-12-SOCCER-ACADEMY], d) \u2018giving time to learn\u2019, e) \u2018tasks at 14 \noptimal level\u2019, f) \u2018repetitious drills\u2019 and g) \u2018playing without teaching\u2019 (e.g., \u201cWhen like people don\u2019t 15 \nunderstand how to play certain sports they don\u2019t teach them, they just put them in a low group... ...they 16 \n[coaches] just can\u2019t be bothered to teach.\u201d [M-12-SOCCER\/CRICK\/RUGBY]). This theme was reconcilable with 17 \nthe task criterion of Ames\u2019 TARGET, but it would also appear to expand upon it.  18 \n\u2018Selection\u2019 was subdivided into: a) \u2018competition for places\u2019, b) \u2018consistent team selection\u2019, c) 19 \n\u2018selecting on form\u2019 (e.g., \u201cTwice in a row I\u2019ve not been chosen  - because like the training before I\u2019ve 20 \nnot been playing my best\u201d [M-12-HOCKEY\/SOCCER]), d) \u2018squad rotation\u2019 and e) \u2018nobody is secure\u2019 (e.g., 21 \n\u201cWhen they get like a triallist in, you\u2019re thinking: \u2018Is he better than me in my position, am I going to get 22 \ndropped or something?\u2019\u201d [M-11-SOCCER-ACADEMY]). The theme of modeling-demonstration was discussed 23 \nsufficiently to warrant mention, because it seemed that facilitating improvement\/learning in this way 24 \nwas construed as motivational by some of the athletes: \u201cThey actually show you what you have to 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     18 \ndo, you see them doing it, and they tell you how you can do it\u2026 so it helps you. [F-11-1 \nNETBALL\/ARCHERY\/SWIM]. 2 \n\u2018Evaluation criteria\u2019 emerged as a theme relating to how athletes felt they were evaluated by their 3 \ncoach. Athletes seemed able to infer how they were being evaluated without necessarily receiving 4 \nfeedback, and this awareness was also reported to influence motivation. Coaches who generally 5 \nemphasized effort, improvement, and good skills were inferred to evaluate using these criteria. For 6 \nexample: \u201cWell, when you lose a match you might play really good football [soccer] and they won\u2019t 7 \ncriticize you at all if you were the better side\u201d [M-10-SOCCER-ACADEMY] and \u201cSay if I, our team played really 8 \nbad but we won, he would be more bothered that we played bad\u201d [M-9-SOCCER-ACADEMY]. Likewise, it was 9 \npossible for coaches to evaluate normatively, for example \u201cSometimes they even tell you like who the 10 \nbest players are, and then the best players are happy, and everyone else wants to catch up to them and 11 \ndo better than them\u201d [M-13-SOCCER]. Participants also reported being aware of when the coach was \u2018fault-12 \nfinding\/scrutinizing\u2019 \u2013 looking for problems and weaknesses:  13 \nHe was always watching me and he knows everything I do wrong... I\u2019m with him so 14 \nmany times a week, so he knows all my little things and he looks at them to try and 15 \nmake them right... it always makes me cry cos like the pressure\u2019s on me [because] he 16 \nknows I\u2019m gonna do something wrong and he picks up on it and writes it down [F-14-17 \nFENC\/ARCH\/TAE-KWON] 18 \nThe evaluation theme in this study concurs with Ames\u2019 suggestions, but equally, it is more 19 \nspecific in identifying the evaluation criteria, as set against the feedback or actions resulting 20 \nfrom these evaluations, as well as going beyond task versus ego constructs.  21 \nParent-specific Themes 22 \nParent support and facilitation. This theme referred to the supportive role carried out by parents 23 \nin transporting their children to training and competitions, purchasing equipment, and offering moral 24 \nsupport from the sidelines. The theme contained three subcategories. First, \u2018material and emotional 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     19 \nsupport\u2019 (e.g., \u201cShe drove me there like every weekend, just for these trials, and I felt like quite proud, 1 \nbecause I had a mum who cared about what I did\u201d [F-12-HOCKEY]), which  replicated findings by Garcia-2 \nBengoechea and Strean (2007) and Beltman and Volet (2007). Second, \u2018unconditional support\u2019 (e.g., 3 \n\u201cWhatever I need she\u2019ll go out there and buy me it\u2026 she doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s for or what it\u2019ll do, but 4 \nshe does it because it makes me happy\u201d [M-17-RUGBY]), which was consistent with findings from Assor et 5 \nal., (2004), Gould et al., (2008), and Pummell, Harwood, and Lavallee (2008). Third, the mere act of 6 \nwatching-spectating was identified as motivationally-relevant (e.g., \u201cSome kids, their parents can\u2019t take 7 \nthem cos they don\u2019t have the time, so they have to go with other people\u2019s parents and it doesn\u2019t really 8 \nfeel like they\u2019re supporting you\u201d [F-14-FENC\/ARCH\/TAE-KWON]).  9 \nParent play-and-teach behaviors. This higher order theme described the activities and behaviors 10 \nundertaken by parents aimed at developing or improving the athlete\u2019s competence. There were three 11 \nemergent categories within this theme. \u2018Over-involved behaviors\u2019 was further subdivided into \u2018taking the 12 \ngame home\u2019, \u2018accepting reflected glory\u2019, and \u2018embarrassing behavior during competition\u2019 and replicated 13 \nfindings by Gould et al. (2008). For example: \u201cIt's alright if they're there and being supportive, but if 14 \nthey're like shouting at you what to do or like being really over the top, then it gets really wrong\u201d [F-13-15 \nTENNIS\/SOCCER]. \u2018Instructional behaviors\u2019 were further subdivided into \u2018conflicting advice to the coach\u2019, 16 \n\u2018reinforcing coach\u2019s advice\u2019, and \u2018overloading with advice\u2019, in a manner synonymous with Gould et al. 17 \n(2008), Holt et al. (2009) and Reeves et al. (2009). \u2018Facilitating practice\u2019 was further subdivided into 18 \n\u2018garden play\u2019 and \u2018encouraging practice\u2019 \u2013 where 'garden play' was analogized with accompanying the 19 \nathlete during free or deliberate play. This category showed similarities with Garcia-Bengoechea and 20 \nStrean (2007), Babkes and Weiss (1999), and Pummell et al. (2008).  21 \nPeer-specific Themes 22 \nPeer relationships and social interactions. The theme referred not only to the quality of 23 \nrelationships, but also seemed to suggest that relationships amongst peers can be used as a commodity 24 \nto either endorse or discourage certain achievement motivations (i.e., the nature and dynamics of these 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     20 \nrelationships and the processes of their formation were commonly referred to as a mechanism by which 1 \naffect, cognitions, and goal adoptions could be influenced). There were three emergent categories: 2 \n\u2018Linking competence to social outcomes\u2019 (e.g., \u201cLike if you get on well with them and you like do a 3 \nreally poor performance they like, don\u2019t wanna be your friend any more\u201d [M-13-ROWING\/CRICKET], which 4 \nwas also identified by Allen (2003) and Vazou et al. (2005); \u2018Friendship and affiliation\u2019 (e.g., \u201cGood 5 \nrelationships... Like respect each other and like stick up for each other\u2026 make sure you all get on, cos 6 \nif you don\u2019t, like, it\u2019s not gonna go well.\u201d [M-15-SOCCER-ACADEMY]), which was also identified by Weiss et 7 \nal. (1996) and Vazou et al. (2005); and \u2018Group identity and perceived belonging\u2019: \u201cIt just makes you 8 \nwant to keep doing that, for them, for the rest of the team.... ...you\u2019ve got another ten people on the 9 \npitch with you and you want to keep doing it for them\u201d [M-13-SOCCER\/CRICKET]. This theme was also 10 \ncompatible with those reported in Weiss et al. (1996) and Vazou et al. (2005). Peer relationships and 11 \nsocial interactions appeared to be the driving force behind many of the themes observed and 12 \nconsequences reported. For example, the giving and receiving of feedback, the decision concerning 13 \nwhether to help a peer improve (or not), or to be competitive (or not), all seemed to be considered in 14 \nrelation to social outcomes (e.g., status, belonging, affiliation). This interdependence was only partially 15 \nreflected in themes such as 'linking competence with social outcomes', but the distinctions between 16 \ndiscriminatory-versus-inclusive playing style, and conflictive-versus-positive rivalries also implicate 17 \nsocial consequences for competence\/achievement-based behaviors. Although such a finding is not 18 \nunique (Skinner & Piek, 2001), it appears to be important and worthy of further investigation. 19 \nCompetition amongst peers. This theme referred to any and all behaviors relating to competition 20 \nand normative comparisons and contained many concepts that appear to replicate the findings of Weiss 21 \net al. (1996) and Vazou et al. (2005). Although several of the emergent categories could be linked to 22 \nconflict and negative outcomes, there were themes suggesting positive outcomes, and also suggesting 23 \nhow normative comparisons can be emphasized by a peer group. This higher order theme contained six 24 \nemergent categories: a) \u2018boasting\u2019 (e.g., \u201cIf somebody in the team is showing off and stuff, saying \u2018I\u2019m 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     21 \nthe best, I\u2019m better than you\u2026.\u2019 then you like want to be better than them, you want to beat them [F-13-1 \nRUNNING\/EQUEST]), b) \u2018pressurizing behaviors\u2019 (e.g., \u201cIf you've got a penalty, and you're the person taking 2 \nit, and they're putting loads of pressure on you, saying 'oh you've got to get it in', it makes you feel like, 3 \n'What if I get it wrong?\u2019\u201d. [F-13-TENNIS\/SOCCER]), c) \u2018leading by example\u2019 (e.g., \u201cI think they help you by 4 \nbeing better than you. Because that\u2019s showing you that if they can do that then you can do that as 5 \nwell\u2026 it makes you think \u2018I\u2019m going to do that too\u2019.\u201d [F-11-NETBALL\/ARCHERY\/SWIM]), d) \u2018rivalry and 6 \nconflict\u2019, e) \u2018positive rivalry\u2019 (e.g., \u201cYou try and be better than them, and they try and be better than 7 \nyou, and then it makes you be better players because you\u2019re always like under pressure, but that\u2019s 8 \ngood\u201d [M-12-SOCCER\/CRICK\/RUGBY]), and f) \u2018discriminatory decisions and behaviors\u2019 \u2013 which involve 9 \nactions such as refusing to pass the ball to an individual.  10 \n Peer collaboration and altruistic behaviors. This theme referred to all behaviors involving 11 \npeers working together or to help each other. As above, the theme \u2018peer collaboration and altruistic 12 \nbehaviors\u2019 contained many similarities with the findings of Weiss et al. (1996), Vazou et al. (2005) and 13 \nGarcia-Bengoechea, and Strean (2007). The emergent category 'emotional and moral support' referred 14 \nto behaviors where peers sought to support each other without necessarily having the aim of improving 15 \nperformance. Examples would include consoling, cheering, distracting someone from nerves, and 16 \nmaking pacts to remain friends regardless of who wins. The emergent category 'emphasizing effort' 17 \nreferred to behaviors wherein peers de-emphasized results and even performance failures and, instead, 18 \nencouraged effort and participation. Examples could include such statements as \u201cnever mind keep 19 \ntrying\u201d or remaining patient while a peer attempts to master a skill. The theme 'collaborative learning' 20 \nreferred to attempts by peers to teach each other or practice together. Within this theme, four 21 \nsubcategories emerged: a) \u2018offering help and advice\u2019 (e.g., \u201cIf you're struggling with a routine or 22 \nsomething they will stay and help you, so it's like looking out for each other\u201d[F-12-SOCCER]), b) 23 \n\u2018withholding help and advice\u2019 (negative case) (e.g., \u201cLike if you ask them for help and they just ignore 24 \nyou\u201d[M-13-RUGBY]). c) \u2018extra practice in spare time\u2019 (e.g., \u201cWe go down to the park, like after and just 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     22 \nhave a kick around\u201d [M-13-SWIM\/SOCCER]), and d) \u2018collaborative playing style\u2019 (e.g., \u201cAt our county trials.... 1 \nthis girl I knew that I was playing on the same team with, we thought like 'oh we'll play together and 2 \nget through'... ...like she would always pass to me.\u201d [F15-NETBALL\/EQUEST]).  3 \nGeneral Discussion 4 \nThis study set out to produce a detailed and integrated description of the motivationally-relevant 5 \nbehaviors of coaches, parents, and peers when supporting specializing sport performers. The focus 6 \ngroups offered pertinent and rich data facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the specific 7 \nbehaviors that social agents may display in influencing the motivation of specializing athletes. As 8 \ndiscussed already, there are encouraging similarities with existing research (which largely uses the 9 \nathletes from the specializing career stage), as well as potential avenues for new research and 10 \ntheoretical discussion throughout the findings. The coaching findings replicate and extend the 11 \nTARGET framework of Ames (1992), as well as sharing commonalities with other exploratory studies 12 \nof coach influences on athlete motivation (Conroy & Coatsworth, 2007; Garcia-Bengoechea & Strean, 13 \n2007; McCarthy & Jones, 2007; Reeves et al., 2009). The parent findings show good similarities with 14 \nboth the coaching findings and also with existing research into parenting styles and influences (e.g., 15 \nGurland & Grolnick, 2005; Gould et al., 2008; Holt et al., 2008; 2009). The peer motivational climate 16 \nsuggested many of the same considerations as Allen (2003), Vazou et al. (2005), and Weiss et al. 17 \n(1999). This observation of similar behaviors and situations in separate studies offers potential for 18 \ntheoretical convergence. 19 \nIn comparing the data from this study to Keegan et al. (2009), which used the same methodology 20 \nwith athletes at the initiation\/sampling career stage, a similar pattern of higher-order themes was 21 \napparent. This similarity suggests consistencies between the motivational influences perceived by 22 \ninitiators and specializers, which is arguably cogent for the following reasons: first, the objectives of 23 \nboth stages are comparable (e.g., maintain interest, learn and improve, recreation 'with an eye for 24 \npotential'). Second, the roles performed by coaches and parents are common. Third, the relationship 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     23 \nbetween athletes and the parent\/coach is also similar, insofar as coaches and parents remain in a 1 \nposition of authority, responsibility and high esteem during both stages. During the later 2 \ninvestment\/mastery stage, the emphasis may change to achievement and performance, athletes are 3 \nlikely to be more self-reliant (able to live alone, drive, provide for themselves) and self-aware, and the 4 \nrelationships may change to become more equal, which might lead one to expect more noticeable 5 \ndifferences in the motivational atmosphere that these athletes would report. However, the specializing 6 \nathletes in this study provided more detailed descriptions within similar themes\/categories (perhaps due 7 \nto increased eloquence and cognitive maturity in these older athletes), and also suggested a greater 8 \nemphasis on skill acquisition, achievement, and competition, which would be consistent with advances 9 \nin career-stage and an increasing focus on skill development (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003). Nevertheless, this 10 \nstudy does provide detailed and internally\/externally consistent descriptions of the behaviors by which 11 \nsocial agents can influence motivation (both immediately and over time); by encouraging continuity 12 \nbetween play and work (cf. C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003). Overall, the findings from this study appear highly 13 \ncompatible with C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al.\u2019s model and may offer additional insights for coaches and practitioners 14 \nworking with specializing athletes.  15 \nLike the Keegan et al. (2009) study, the roles performed by social agents, and the manner in 16 \nwhich these roles are fulfilled, emerged as the most parsimonious way of organizing the analysis. For 17 \nexample, all three social agents produced a theme synonymous with 'feedback', and although the 18 \ncontent of this theme was slightly different for peers, there were noticeable similarities between coach 19 \nfeedback and parent evaluative behavior. Parents and coaches showed the strongest similarities, with 20 \nleadership style, evaluative behaviors\/feedback, emotional and affective responses, and pre-21 \nperformance motivating behaviors all emerging in both dimensions and showing good consistencies. 22 \nThese similarities are most likely indicative of an overlap in the types of roles performed by parents and 23 \ncoaches, in that they may exert similar motivational influences as a result of performing functionally 24 \nanalogous tasks and roles (e.g., support, facilitation, instruction, care-giving). Nevertheless, where 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     24 \nsocial agents perform unique roles, their influences are unique too; for example, the manner in which 1 \ncoaches perform the key roles of instruction, selection, and management (collaboratively, positively, 2 \ntolerantly) can all influence athlete motivation. In contrast, the role of parents revolves heavily around 3 \nsupport and facilitation, and the manner in which this support is provided (unconditionally, positively, 4 \ncollaboratively) also appeared key. The role of peers revolves around friendship, cooperation, and the 5 \nreinforcement of rules\/values amongst the peer group. Once again, the manner in which this role is 6 \nfulfilled (narcissistically, altruistically, tolerantly) was central in determining athlete motivation. As the 7 \nathletic career progresses, these roles are likely to change (Cote et al., 2003) and in order to plan 8 \nsuccessful interventions and build understanding, these changing roles and their integral links to 9 \nmotivational influences must be appraised.  10 \nIn this paper and several others (e.g., Garcia-Bengoechea & Strean, 2007; Keegan et al., 2009), 11 \nthe emergent picture of social and environmental influences on motivation has not been a dichotomy 12 \nbetween performance-versus-mastery definitions of competence, or approach-versus-avoidance 13 \nmotivational valences. Instead, a rich plethora of motivational influences has emerged, containing 14 \ncompetence as well as social goals and autonomy goals, supported and endorsed (or undermined) by 15 \nkey social agents across a variety of contexts and situations.  16 \nAnother key finding was that individual behaviors (and broader themes) from coaches, parents, 17 \nand peers were rarely associated with a consistent motivational effect. For example, depending on the 18 \nrespondent, the source, and the context, criticism was associated with reduced motivation, 19 \nanger\/frustration, avoidance-based motivation, improvement\/mastery (or increased effort), and 20 \nthwarted autonomy. These findings suggest that the relationship between the behaviors of social agents 21 \nand their influence on motivation was moderated by a number of contextual, interpersonal and 22 \nintrapersonal factors (cf., Elliot, 1999). Thus, in a manner that replicates Keegan et al. (2009), there 23 \nappeared to be a complex interactivity between motivationally-relevant behaviors and their effect on 24 \nmotivation. To be clear, as a rule it was almost impossible to establish any direct and exclusive 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     25 \ncorrespondence between the behavior of a coach, parent, or peer and the effect on athlete motivation. 1 \nThe influence of any single motivationally-relevant behavior seemed to be moderated by other factors, 2 \nsuch as: a) the behaviors immediately preceding the event, b) co-occurring behaviors (e.g., \u201cit\u2019s not 3 \nwhat you said, it\u2019s the way (or moment, or place) you said it\u201d), c) the consistency of the behavior in 4 \nrelation to the person concerned and in comparison to others, d) the relationship between the athlete 5 \nand protagonist, and e) other contextual or environmental variables (e.g., training vs. competition or 6 \nstage-of-season). This complex picture could be viewed as a first step towards deconstruction of the 7 \nmotivational climate (or \u201catmosphere\u201d), called for in studies such as Smith et al. (2007). Elliot (1999) 8 \nalso speculated: \u201cit is also possible that some of the antecedent variables combine together to jointly 9 \nand interactively predict achievement goal adoption\u201d (p.176). The closest thing to an exception 10 \nregarding the above rule was the theme of positivity. Ideas surrounding positive feedback, positive 11 \naffect, positive pre-competition talks (pep-talks), encouragement, collaboration\/support, and fun (e.g., 12 \nin training) permeated the analysis and were consistently associated with positive effects on athlete 13 \nmotivation. Among specializing sport performers, where a key aim is to encourage athletes to view 14 \ndeliberate training as intrinsically rewarding by allowing continuity between play and work (cf., C\u00f4t\u00e9 et 15 \nal., 2003), considerations of positivity should be central, even if accompanied by a focus on technical 16 \nproficiency.  17 \nThe current findings provide evidence that all the theories of motivation reviewed in the 18 \nintroduction are relevant to the study of social and motivational influences on motivation. Not only are 19 \nthese various constructs evident, there were suggestions that they may interact, such that, for example, 20 \nrelatedness might be used to incentivize competence (cf. Wentzel, 1993), or autonomy-support might 21 \ncontribute to an improved relationship (cf. Gurland & Grolnick, 2005). It is possible that with carefully 22 \ndesigned research studies, the complex interplay between competence, relatedness, and autonomy 23 \nneeds, as indicated in this study, might begin to emerge.  24 \nRecommendations and Implications 25 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     26 \nThe critical-realist approach in the current research cautions against the influence of having a 1 \nsingle dominant paradigm\/theory guiding the exploration and analysis of the motivational atmosphere. 2 \nDuda and Whitehead (1998) expressed concerns related to the wide range of questionnaires assessing 3 \nmotivational climate purely from a dichotomous AGT perspective. Hence, the findings of this study 4 \nmay be used to inform a series of broader studies assessing the precise influence of coach, parent, and 5 \npeer behaviors. Such studies may help to determine the relative importance of each social agent, give 6 \nus the ability to establish which aspects of an intervention are the most influential in effecting 7 \nmotivational outcomes (Smith et al., 2007), and enable researchers to compare the observed behaviors 8 \nof social agents with what the athletes perceive. This work would enable practitioners and researchers 9 \nto: a) offer appropriate insights into adaptive and maladaptive contextually-relevant behaviors, b) 10 \neducate coaches and parents about the effective management of peers in their sessions, and c) work 11 \ndirectly with specializing athletes on the development of an effective peer-related atmosphere. Hence, 12 \nfrom the perspective of applied intervention research, this study encourages practitioners and 13 \nacademics to devote time to studying themes and behaviors across social agents in a manner that will 14 \nenhance the content of educational programs. In combination with other studies (e.g., Conroy & 15 \nCoatsworth, 2007; Garcia-Bengoechea & Strean, 2007; Gould et al., 2008; Holt et al., 2008; 2009; 16 \nKeegan et al., 2009; McCarthy & Jones, 2007), this research builds a picture of motivational influences 17 \nacross the developmental trajectory of athletes\u2019 careers, which should ultimately enable the design of 18 \ntraining environments that encourage enjoyment, participation, persistence, and improvement \u2013 19 \nwhether or not athletes progress to the elite level or simply maintain a recreational interest. 20 \n         Motivational Atmosphere in Specializing Athletes     27 \nReferences \nAllen, J.B.
