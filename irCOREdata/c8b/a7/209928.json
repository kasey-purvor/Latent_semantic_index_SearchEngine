Under the administrations of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (I995-2002) and especially President Lula (2003-), conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes \nhave become adopted as mainstream social policy in Brazil. This follows a marked \ntrend since the 1990s in Latin America towards the setting up of targeted safety \nnets to alleviate poverty. Lula consolidated and expanded CCTs, firstly under \nFome Zero and later Bolsa Familia, now the largest such scheme in the world. Its four \nsub-programmes (educational stipends to boost school attendance, maternal \nnutrition, food supplements and a domestic gas subsidy) benefit some 30 million of \nBrazil's poorest people, with a target of 44 million by 2006. Since 2003, spending on \nBolsa Familia has risen significantly to consume over one-third of the social assist- \nance budget for the poorest sectors and it remained a flagship olicy in the run-up \nto the presidential elections of October 2006. Although coverage of Bolsa Familia \nis impressive, however, systematic evaluation of its social and economic impacts \nis still lacking. Evidence from other CCT programmes in Latin America suggests \nthat positive results may be achieved in terms of meeting some immediate needs of \nthe poor. However, there have been many implementation problems. These include \npoor beneficiary targeting, lack of inter-ministerial coordination, inadequate \nmonitoring, clientelism, weak accountability and alleged political bias. Given the \nheightened profile of cash transfers inBrazil's social policy agenda, key questions \nneed to be asked. These concern, firstly, the extent o which Bolsa Familia does \nindeed contribute to poverty alleviation; and secondly, whether it creates greater \ndependence of the poor on government hand-outs and political patronage at the \nexpense of long-term social investment for development. \nIntroduction \nWhen President Luis Inicio Lula da Silva took office in January 2003, Fome \nZero (Zero Hunger) soon became the defining flagship policy of his \ngovernment.

Building \nupon policies already established under the administration f President \nFernando Henrique Cardoso, Fome Zero sought to expand and consolidate \nthe social safety net programme.' It also represented a heartfelt personal \ncommitment by Brazil's first working class president to address the country's \nseemingly intractable problems of poverty and severe inequality. At his \ninauguration, Lula famously pledged: 'If, by the end of my term of office, \nevery Brazilian has food to eat three times a day, I shall have fulfilled my \nmission in life.' \nBrazil's enthusiasm for constructing social safety nets has followed \na marked international trend in policy-making since the late I98os.2 The \nfree market ideology developed under the Reagan and Thatcher adminis- \ntrations, amongst others, was transferred to the developing countries \nthrough programmes of economic stabilisation and structural adjustment \nvia the IMF and World Bank. Under a varying package of measures ome- \ntimes loosely referred to as the 'Washington Consensus',3 moves towards \nmarket deregulation and increased competition would lead to the dis- \nmantling of state machinery, growing privatisation of service provision and \ncutbacks in public spending, especially in the social sectors. This process \nhelped to destroy much of the social protection infrastructure in a region \nwhere effective and universal welfare systems had been developed in \nonly five countries (Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba and Uruguay), and \nwhere the impacts of social policies have generally been regressive with \nnegative distributional consequences. Higher income groups have secured \nthe lion's share of benefits and subsidies in key sectors uch as education, \nhealth and pensions provision. On cost grounds, universalisation has \nbeen dismissed as too expensive in the context of developing countries. In \nparticular, it was argued that such generous anti-poverty solutions were \nnot affordable under conditions of economic austerity. However, even \nmore critically, the notion of universal citizenship rights has (except in \nthe case of Cuba) generally been eschewed in favour of selective social \n1 'Safety nets' is a broad label to describe short-term, targeted interventions for vulnerable \nhouseholds designed to mitigate the immediate effects of poverty and other risks, providing \nassistance in the form of cash, food, housing, subsidies, fee waivers, scholarships and \npublic works programmes. \n2 A.

These nets would \nnot only 'catch' the poor and 'protect' them from economic shocks in the \nshort term; they would also provide a 'springboard' for development, \ncreating employment and income-earning opportunities through strategies of \n'social risk management'.6 In Latin America, social safety nets have been \nenthusiastically embraced by many governments. In particular, conditional \ncash transfer (CCT) programmes are increasingly regarded as a major social \npolicy instrument ina number of countries. Since the late 1990s, apart from \nBrazil, major CCT programmes have been introduced in Mexico (Progresa, \nnow known as Oportunidades), Colombia (Familias en Accidn), Chile (Subsidio \nUnitario Familiar), Nicaragua (Red de Proteccio'n Social), Argentina (Jefes de Hogar) \nand Ecuador (Bono de Desarrollo Humano).7 \nTheir underlying principle is that human capital can be enhanced as \na development vehicle by providing money to families to persuade them to \ninvest in themselves through greater participation in education and health \nservices. The technical rationale is that, by focusing on children, long-term \nhuman capital accumulation can help break the inter-generational trans- \nmission of poverty. Through stimulating effective d mand for social services, \nit is also designed to counter the shortcomings of supply-side interventions \nsuch as schools and clinics that often do not reach the poor. This CCT \napproach, in theory at least, contrasts with traditional social assistance \n4 C. Abel and C. Lewis, 'A Diagnosis of Social Policy in Latin America in the Long Run', in \nC. Abel and C. Lewis (eds), Exclusion and Engagement: Social Policy in Latin America (London, \n2002), pp. 3-71. \n5 See G. Cornia, et al., Adjustment with a Human Face (Oxford, 1987), and T.

It aims to foster joint responsibility between families \nand the government, placing the onus on parents to spend cash wisely and \nensure attendance at schools and health clinics. Thus, it is seen as con- \nstituting a break from clientelism and, in the words of one World Bank study, \n'has been heralded as an alternative to more traditional, paternalistic \napproaches to social assistance and has helped counter criticisms of CCT \nprogrammes as handouts'.8 However, as the case of Brazil considered below \nillustrates, this is very much a matter of contention. \nYet CCT programmes are seen as offering other innovations and \nadvantages over traditional social assistance. In addition to encouraging \nhuman capital formation a d family responsibility, CCTs are reputedly easier \nto target than other social assistance programmes, using geographical and \nhousehold level criteria, including proxy-means tests to estimate household \npoverty levels. Providing cash (rather than benefits in kind, food stamps \nor vouchers) is more cost-effective and flexible, and avoids the creation \nof distorting secondary markets. Furthermore, the focus on health, education \nand nutrition fosters those synergies amongst diverse components of \nhuman capital considered essential for breaking the vicious circle of inter- \ngenerational poverty. Several countries adopting CCTs have also carried \nout evaluations that have provided empirical evidence of their effectiveness, \nfacilitating scaling-up and political-administrative continuity. \nSocial sector and social assistance spending in Brazil \nGovernment figures show that social sector spending as a whole in Brazil is \nquite high, at 16 per cent of GDP, with funding of direct costs equivalent \nto 14.1 per cent of GDP (Table i). In 2004, social security, including \npensions, accounted for 60o per cent of direct social spending in Brazil, health \nfor 13 per cent and education for just over five per cent. However, Brazil's \nsocial sector investment, while comparing reasonably well with the OECD \naverage of 25 per cent of GDP, is undermined by its high spending on \npensions. Whereas pensions in OECD countries account on average for 3 3 \nper cent of spending, this figure rises to 44 per cent in the case of Brazil, \nsurpassed only by Italy and Mexico.9 \n'Social assistance', targeted at the poorest groups, remains a relatively \nsmall proportion of the total social budget. However, it has expanded \nsteadily under the administrations of both Fernando Henrique Cardoso \n(1995-zoo2) and, especially, Lula (2003--).

By 2004, social assistance was \nbudgeted at R$16.2 billion, equivalent to 0.9 per cent of GDP and 6.5 per \ncent of the total social budget. In nominal terms, therefore, total social \nassistance spending leapt by 60 per cent under Lula from 2002-2004. \nHowever, as a proportion of the total social budget the increase was less \ndramatic, although still significant, moving from 5.6 to 6.5 per cent. \nIncreased spending for Bolsa Familia specifically has been more marked. \nAs Table I shows, spending on the four major safety net programmes, \ncomprising what has become known as Bolsa Familia, grew from 23 per \ncent of the social assistance budget (R$2.4 billion) in 2oo02 under FHC to 36 \nper cent (R$5.8 billion) under Lula in 2004. This rose to R$6.5 billion in \n2005 and will reach a predicted R$8.3 billion in 2006, or 38 per cent of \noverall social assistance.

The programme itself was inspired by Jose Graziano \nda Silva, former professor of agrarian studies at the University of Campinas \nin SIo Paulo, appointed by Lula to head the newly created Ministry of Food \nSecurity and Fight Against Hunger. Fome Zero was in practice an umbrella \nprogramme for initiatives already developed under the FHC administration. \nThese federal initiatives had in turn developed from localised projects started \nduring the I990s, replacing an earlier programme of distributing food parcels \n(cestas baisicas-PRODEA) which operated from 1993 to 2000 and was \ndesigned to provide for the needs of a family for one month.12 However, \nn Brazil, Orcamento Social. \n12 Smaller CCT projects had already been implemented at municipal level from 1995 onwards \nin Campinas, Brasilia, Blumenau, Belo Horizonte, Victoria, Salvador and Ribeirdo Preto. \nSee J. Graziano da Silva, W. Belik and M. Takagi, 'The Challenges of a Policy of Food \nSocial Policies and Poverty Alleviation under Lula 695 \nfood parcels were heavily criticised for being unashamedly used to capture \nvotes, with 30 million being distributed inthe general election year of 1998, \ntwice the normal number.13 Fome Zero thus brought ogether under one label \nseveral existing initiatives; namely, the conditional cash transfer (CCT) pro- \ngrammes of Bolsa Escola for boosting school attendance, Bolsa Alimentafdo for \nmaternal nutrition a d the PETI programme against child labour, along with \nthe Auxilio Gds cooking gas subsidy. However, it also added a new food \nentitlement scheme, the Cartao Alimentafdo, based on the use of a special \ncredit card for the purchase of selected food items. \nThe flagship within this 'flagship' programme, however, was always Bolsa \nEscola (School Grant) that provides mothers with a monthly stipend \n(currently the equivalent of US$7 per month per child) in return for their \nchildren attending school at least 85 per cent of the time. Started in the \nFederal District of Brasilia in 1995, by then governor Cristovam Buarque, as \nwell as in Campinas and Sdo Paulo, it was adopted nationally in 2001. By the \nend of 2003, the scheme had been implemented in almost all of the country's \n5,561 municipalities and had distributed almost US$5 oo million in grants to \nover five million families with 8.6 million children. According to the latest \navailable figures, Bolsa Escola accounts for around half the total spending on \nthe four major safety net programmes under Bolsa Familia.14 \nIn consolidating existing safety net programmes, however, the Lula \nadministration did introduce some major changes. Firstly, in line with \nPresident Lula's electoral promises, Fome Zero was underpinned by a clear \nand vociferous political commitment tobenefit he very poorest sectors of \nBrazilian society. Secondly, while implementation of the programme was \ndecentralised to municipal level, Graziano's ministry attempted, in some \nmeasure, to bypass local political interests o create an alternative distribution \nnetwork; for example, by substituting food stamps with credit card style \nfood cards which were in theory at least less vulnerable to incorrect use. \nHowever, as noted below, decentralisation fprogramme implementation \nhas brought its own political problems. Third, appeals were made to major \ncompanies such as Ford and Unilever, as well as to supermarket chains, for \ncontributions towards Fome Zero that would signify a new sense of corporate \nsocial responsibility and alliance between public and private sectors. Over \n00oo companies are now involved in the scheme. \nInternational donors such as the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter- \nAmerican Development Bank moved quickly to endorse the Lula govern- \nment's anti-poverty stance. After all, it testified to the new administration's \nSecurity in Brazil', in A. Cimadamore, H. Dean and J. Siqueira (eds), The Poverty ofthe State: \nreconsidering the role of the state in the struggle against global poverty (Buenos Aires, 200oo), \npp. 157-78. 13 Ibid. \n14 Brazil, Orfamento Social. \n696 Anthony Hall \nprudent social policies, belying its radical left-wing image. It also fitted in \nvery nicely with the increasingly popular view held by international financial \ninstitutions, led by the World Bank, of social policy as the construction of \nsafety nets.15 During the 1980s and 90s, the introduction ofsocial funds to \ndeal with the adverse impacts of structural adjustment had become well \nestablished.16 Subsequently, the collapse of the Soviet Union and compre- \nhensive social security schemes in the former communist countries, together \nwith the East Asia crisis, led to the introduction flarge-scale, targeted social \nprotection measures with World Bank assistance. As noted above, these \nemergency measures were now couched in the language of 'social risk \nmanagement', intended to go beyond the provision of short-term relief to \nhelp strengthen people's livelihoods and their ability to cope with shocks and \nrisks in the long-term. At the same time, the Bank set up a special Social \nProtection Unit within its Human Development network to oversee this \npolicy. In 2005,zoo social protection accounted for some 12 per cent of total \nBank lending, with US$2.5 billion invested in 45 projects.17 \nYet despite the initial enthusiasm which accompanied the inauguration of \nFome Zero in early 2003, serious problems soon became apparent. Many were \ndue to the fact that each programme operated independently of the other \nwith no overall coordination. Each had separate administrative structures, \nbeneficiary selection processes and banking contracts for payments. The \nLula government inherited a partially unified atabase, or Cadastro Unico, \nfrom the previous administration but this covered only 70 per cent of poor \nfamilies. This made effective implementation more difficult, eading to high \nimplementation costs and targeting errors.18 Problems included the adoption \nof political criteria for selecting beneficiary families, an over-centralised \nmanagement system, exclusion of some eligible poor families, duplication of \nbenefits and a lack of updated information. Even the then Minister Graziano \npublicly admitted to a targeting error under the programme of up to 30 per \ncent, which led to long delays in implementation.19 \nBolsa Familia \nBy mid-zoo3, just a few months into the Lula administration, such problems \nwere already creating disillusionment with Fome Zero, which was perceived as \nincreasingly ineffective in fulfilling its mission to fight hunger and absolute \n15 Hall and Midgley, Social Poliy for Development, Sage (London, 2004). \n16 K.

The newly labelled Bolsa Familia (Family Grant) scheme was thus \nannounced in October 2003 to integrate the actions and budgets of the four \nmain CCT programmes; namely Bolsa Escola, Bolsa Alimentafdo, Cartdo \nAlimentafdo and Auxilio Gds. Bolsa Familia is now the largest conditional cash \ntransfer programme in the world. The distinctive Fome Zero label was retained \nas a wider umbrella term to encapsulate the overall safety net programme in \nBrazil involving a diverse range of over 30 social interventions i  the areas of \nfood security, farming and other forms of support, including Bolsa Tamilia, \nalthough the label is regarded as cosmetic.20 \nThe unification of safety net programmes under Bolsa Familia involved \nsignificant changes. Under the old set-up, the components of Fome Zero were \nadministered separately: Bolsa Escola (Ministry of Education), Bolsa \nAlimentafdo (Ministry of Health), Cartdo Alimentafdo (F me Zero) and Auxilo \nGas (Ministry of Mines and Energy). Although providing benefits to roughly \nthe same target population, they were difficult to administer, each scheme \nhaving its own bureaucratic structure, data collection, fiduciary responsi- \nbilities and reporting systems. Not only was this fragmentation costly, but it \nsacrificed potential benefits in terms of synergies and complementarities at \nthe family level in schooling, health and nutrition. By contrast, integration \nhas helped reduce administrative costs, improve targeting efficiency, \nstandardise procedures and results indicators and coordinate federal with \nstate level safety net programmes. Conditionalities for education, health and \nnutrition were merged to produce greater synergy while unit transfer benefits \nwere also increased. There is a new emphasis on targeting the household unit \nrather than the individual. \nHowever, many aspects of Bolsa Familia implementation remain decen- \ntralised to municipal level. These include data collection, registration of \npotential beneficiaries under a single register (Cadastro Unico) and monitoring \nof adherence to conditionalities. Under Brazil's decentralisation law, each \nmunicipality is required to set up a social council (Conselho de Controle Social) \nfor this purpose, whose members are chosen by the mayor from public and \ncivil society sectors. \nIn January 2004, President Lula announced the integration of the Ministry \nof Food Security and Fight against Hunger with the Ministry of Social \nWelfare to form the new Ministry of Social Development and Fight against \nHunger (MDS). Graziano was replaced by Patrus Ananias as Minister of \nSocial Development. The Inter-ministerial Management Committee and \nExecutive Secretariat for Bolsa Familia, originally linked directly to the \nPresident's Office, were transferred to the new MDS in order to facilitate \nbetter integration of social programmes. \n20 \nhttp:\/\/www.fomezero.gov.br\/ \n698 Anthony Hall \nThe scheme is targeted at two groups, the 'very poor' with household \nincomes of up to R$5o (US$23 per month), and the 'poor' with household \nincomes of R$5 1-IOO (US$23.50-46) per month. The upper limit was \nincreased in April zoo6 to R$2zo (US$5 5) in order to facilitate attainment of\nthe overall target numbers. Very poor families are awarded a fixed monthly \nstipend of R$5o regardless of family size, while families earning between \nR$5 1-120 per month receive no basic payment. Both groups are eligible for \nvariable payments of R$I1 (US$7) per child of school age (6-15) to a maximum of three, or up to six years of age under Bolsa Alimentafdo. The \nmaximum benefit per household was set at R$95 (US$43). These cash grants \nare conditional upon proof of regular presence at school, children's \nvaccination, attendance at health clinics and, where relevant, participation in \nnutrition and vocational training courses. The gas subsidy provides R$I5 \nevery two months for the same social groups to purchase cooking gas \ncylinders. The Cartao Alimentafdo, or food card system, was initiated in March \n2003 for the poor, semi-arid Northeast as part of Fome Zero. It gives families \nearning up to half the minimum wage a monthly cash supplement of R$50 for food purchases. \nIn June 2004, the World Bank approved a US$57z million sector-wide \nloan (SWAP) to support Bolsa Familia. This will provide funds for cash \ntransfers (96 per cent) as well as for technical assistance to develop a unified \ndatabase, improve targeting mechanisms, develop a system for monitoring \nand evaluation, strengthen the institutions involved and the programme's \nimplementation capacity within the MDS and to develop a dissemination a d \ncommunications strategy.21 In December of the same year, the Inter- \nAmerican Development Bank (1DB) approved a loan of US$I billion for \nBolsa Familia, with the promise of up to US$z billion, depending on satis- \nfactory progress.22 These two multilateral commitments, totalling US$2.57 \nbillion, are the equivalent of one-quarter of the estimated total funding \nfor Bolsa Familia (R$24 billion) during the Lula government and provide \nan unequivocal external endorsement of the safety net\/CCT approach to \npoverty reduction in Brazil. The Bank has also been very generous in its \npublic praise for Bolsa Familia, whose instruments are seen as having an \napplicability beyond Brazil itself to other countries implementing CCT \nschemes.23 \n21 World Bank, Project Appraisal Document on a Proposed Adaptable Program Loan to the Federative \nRepublic of Brazil in Support of the First Phase of the Bolsa Familia Program (Washington DC, May \n25, 2004). \n22 cIDB approves loan of US$i billion for expansion and consolidation of social protection in \nBrazil based on the Bolsa Familia program', Press Release, 15 December (2004). 23 K.

However, results on regular attendance are mixed while the issue \nof quality of schooling provided is not usually addressed. Child health and \nnutrition has also improved in these countries as a result of CCTs, with \ngreater participation in growth monitoring and immunisation campaigns. At \nthe same time, food security has improved, with cash transfers leading to \nhigher levels of consumption and nutrition. Evaluation results how that \nover 80 per cent of CCT programme benefits in these countries reach the \npoorest 40 per cent of families.25 \nWhile this first round of evaluation results is, in general terms, encourag- \ning, evidence on the performance of Bolsa Familia has yet to be systematically \ngathered. In terms of numerical achievements, he record of Bolsa Familia has \nbeen impressive in many respects. First, the number of beneficiaries has \nmore than doubled in three years to over 30 million. This is the equivalent \nof roughly three-quarters of those living below the poverty line, who are \nconcentrated mainly in the poorest North and Northeast regions. Second, \naccording to official estimates, the average level of benefit paid per family has \nalmost tripled from R$28 (US$I 3) to R$75 (US$34) per month.26 By the end \nof 2005, some 8.7 million families had been included and this figure was \nexpected to rise by late zoo6 to 1.2 million families or 44 million people, its \neventual target population.27 \nAt the moment, based on evidence from other Latin American countries, \nsweeping assumptions are being made that safety net programmes such as \nthese can reduce inequalities, strengthen human capital and improve people's \nwell-being. Brazil's Ministry of Finance, for example, has confidently \ndeclared that, 'programmes such as Bolsa Familia re highly efficient instru- \nments in the fight against poverty.'28 Official government statements othe \npress regularly make similar claims. The reported reduction in rural poverty \nlevels in Brazil from 39.5 per cent in 2003 to 3 5.4 per cent in 2004 has been \nattributed in large measure to cash transfers such as pensions and Bolsa \n24 Rawlings, A New Approach toSocialAssistance. 25 Ibid. \n26 Brazil, Orfamento Social, p. 24. \n27 Ibid.

Questions have also been raised over \na number of key operational dimensions concerning, for example, targeting \nand selection procedures, the effectiveness of conditionalities, the role of \npolitics and clientelism, weak local institutional capacity, the participation of \ncivil society and the degree of transparency and accountability. \nAlthough there has not yet been any comprehensive impact evaluation of \nBolsa Familia, some investigations have been carried out. A longitudinal \nstudy by the Ministry of Health and the International Food Policy Research \nInstitute (IFPRI) in four northeastern municipalities, over an 18 month \nperiod from 2002-2003, concluded that the Food Grant (Bolsa Alimentadio) \ncomponent, which makes monthly cash grants to women of R$25 (US$I i) conditional upon regular health clinic attendance, had succeeded in boosting \nthe food security of mothers and children. The quantity and diversity of food \nconsumed improved, while the growth and nutritional status of children had \nprogressed compared with non-participants in the programme.\"3 A com- \nprehensive impact evaluation of Bolsa Familia is underway during 200 5-06, \nfunded by the World Bank loan mentioned above, that will no doubt shed \nlight on the consequences for school attendance, nutrition status and other \nsocial indicators.31 An ex-ante valuation of Bolsa Escola using simulation \ntechniques concluded that it would increase school enrolments amongst \npoor ten- to I 5-year olds by 60o per cent but would reduce poverty by just one \nper cent.32 An early evaluation of the PETI child labour scheme in selected \nNortheastern states showed that it reduced the probability that children \nwould work by up to 26 per cent.33 \nAlthough comprehensive impact evaluations of Bolsa Familia as a whole \nare presently lacking, some studies have been carried out of Bolsa Escola, its \nlargest component, which was introduced in various municipalities during \nthe 1990s before being extended as a national programme in 2001. One such \ninvestigation into early municipal school stipend programmes, based on 2000 \nCensus data, found that they had a positive impact on school attendance but \n29 'Queda da pobreza e maior no campo que nas metr6poles', Folha de Sdo Paulo, I January \n(zoo6). \n30 Ministry of Health, Avaliafdo Final de Impacto do Programa Bolsa-Alimentafdo (Brasilia, 2004). \nA similar study is being carried out by the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) in three \nnortheastern municipalities of Bolsa Familia impacts upon the local economy, health and \nnutrition status. \n31 This is being undertaken by Centre for Development and Regional Planning \n(CEDEPLAR) at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. \n32 F.

That is, the cash transfers provided were \ntoo small an incentive to persuade families to forgo child labour.34 More \nworryingly, research based on Brazil's national household survey (PNAD) \nfor 2003 concluded that Bolsa Escola, which is aimed at children aged from six \nto 15 years of age, is poorly targeted and does not benefit hose families \nwhose children are more likely to be persuaded to attend school by a cash \nstipend.35 The study found that, for children aged between seven and 13, the \ncash incentive ffect is negligible since they are likely to attend anyway as \nprovision is universal. Yet it is in this age group where most Bolsa Escola \nbenefits are concentrated. However, children start dropping out of school at \nage 14 and it is in the 14 to 17 age range where a cash incentive would be \nmost effective inretaining children, the study concludes. The same research \ninto Bolsa Escola found that the programme is generally well focused on \npoorer social groups, with 50 per cent of benefits reaching the two lowest \nincome deciles. Yet 18 per cent of cash transfers accrue to 1.5 million chil- \ndren in the fifth income decile and higher, suggesting the presence of some \ndistributive distortions.36 \nFurther evidence on the effectiveness of Bolsa Escola is provided by \na process evaluation of its implementation, based on field surveys carried out \nin 2004 in 261 randomly selected municipalities in four states of Northeast \nBrazil.37 Although programme impacts on targeting, educational partici- \npation and poverty alleviation will be assessed only at a later date, the study \nnevertheless provides important initial insights into the highly variable mu- \nnicipal record of implementation and some of the problems encountered. \nThe evaluation found, for example, that beneficiary screening and selection \nfor Bolsa Escola is based on a range of objective and diverse criteria set at local \nand federal levels (such as per capita family income, schooling, family size, \nages of children, health records, etc.) and that the process is on the whole \nquite transparent, with widespread discussion and dissemination of infor- \nmation. Initial confusion over the respective roles of municipal and central \ngovernment in beneficiary selection was clarified under Bolsa Familia by a \nruling which transferred responsibility for this task over to the federal \nauthorities. \n34 E.

This observation is consistent with alleged \ncases of resource misuse and corruption under Bolsa Familia documented \nregularly in the Brazilian press. Involvement of the mayor's office in ben- \neficiary registration and selection was associated with the highest levels of \nclientelism and patronage. The absence of 'social councils' comprising local \ncitizens and authority representatives, whose function is to monitor pro- \ngramme execution and induce a degree of transparency and accountability, \nwas found to increase the likelihood of such favouritism. Where they had \nbeen set up, and where they were actually working (in two-thirds of cases), \ncouncils were found to be quite effective on the whole and their impact on \nprogramme implementation was generally positive. Yet one-fifth of munici- \npalities sampled had no such council, despite the fact that it is a federal \nrequirement. It was also found that they often performed poorly, their ob- \njectivity in monitoring beneficiary selection and adherence to conditionalities \n(such as school attendance) being compromised by local connections and \naffiliation to the mayor, to whom council members were not infrequently \n38 R.

One official report by the federal auditors (Tribunal de Contas \nda Unido) strongly criticised Bolsa Tamilia for its lack of programme moni- \ntoring.41 \nA major bone of contention i  discussions over the effectiveness of CCTs \nlies in the supposedly 'conditional' nature of cash transfers. As noted earlier, \nthe theory is that benefits should be contingent upon mothers and children \nmeeting social obligations such as regular school attendance, undergoing \nhealth screening and receiving vaccinations. Not only anecdotal evidence, \nbut also systematic research, demonstrates that in practice the monitoring \nand enforcement ofsuch conditionalities s highly problematic. For example, \nschool teachers are often reluctant o report absent pupils, while social \ncouncils eem unable or unwilling to perform a policing role. In the words of \none study: \nThe federal government is unable to supervise the behaviour of poor families \nthroughout the country; local governments and municipalities are either inefficient \nor tied up with local elites, or both; and community grassroots organisations are \neasily captured by political parties and movements.42 \nImposing conditionalities s often seen not only as difficult inpractice but \nalso as paternalistic in principle, leading many to recommend its replacement \nby unconditional support.43 Only time will tell whether such obligations are \njustified in terms of inducing improvements in economic and social in- \ndicators and in building human capital. \nBeyond questions of operational effectiveness, however, lie more funda- \nmental concerns. Serious doubts have been raised, for example, about the \nability of such safety nets, even when properly implemented, to mount \na serious challenge to poverty in the context of highly unequal societies \nsuch as Brazil. Some critics allege that Bolsa Familia is an essentially \npolitically-driven strategy for holding down increases in the legal minimum \nwage which, they maintain, would actually benefit more families working \nin both formal and informal sectors, through multiplier effects. In contrast, \nbased on IPEA research findings, the government insists that selective \nincome transfers have had a more significant anti-poverty impact than wage \npolicy.44 Echoing the more universalistic wage policy approach, Senator \nEduardo Suplicy (Sio Paulo, PT) has for over a decade been fighting \n41 'Para o TCU, falta de fiscalizavdo prejudica Bolsa-Familia', 0 Estado de Sao Paulo, 30 \nSeptember (2004). \n42 S.

Although Suplicy regards Bolsa Familia \nas the first step towards uch a Citizen's Basic Income, there are clearly major \npractical and ideological differences between the safety net approach and the \nidea of a Citizen's Basic Income as a right.46 \nYet other more far-reaching criticisms of the Bolsa Familia approach to \nsocial policy concern Brazil's persistent inequality and relative deprivation, \ndespite improvements in levels of absolute poverty. With the seventh \nmost unequal income distribution i  the world, the top 20 per cent in Brazil \nearn almost 64 per cent of personal income and the bottom quintile just \n2.3 per cent.47 Although the challenges of dealing with absolute poverty and \ninequality are distinct and imply separate kinds of economic and social \npolicies, frustration is sometimes expressed over the seeming inability of \nBolsa Familia to bring about any redistribution fwealth. However, even \nstrong advocates of targeted income transfers, such as the World Bank, \nadmit that they cannot on their own overcome the poverty generated and \nsustained by entrenched inequities. Ironically, Lula himself acknowledged \nthis publicly, declaring that, 'Bolsa Familia is not our salvation, merely an \nemergency measure ... and the ideal is that in a few years time Bolsa Familia \nwill no longer be necessary.'48 \nYet the blatant politicisation of Bolsa aramilia suggests that it may retain a\nlong-term role in Brazil's social policy agenda. It is evident hat Lula and his \ngovernment came to depend heavily on the programme to strengthen pol- \nitical support and generate votes in the October zoo6 presidential elections. \n45 Suplicy, 'The Approval ...'. IPEA, Politicas Sociais:Acompanhamento eA alise, no. 8, February \n(2004). \n46 In a similar vein, human rights activists have for some time advocated the idea of \na universal child benefit in cash or kind, designed to guarantee longer-term inimum \nliving standards and have a more sustainable anti-poverty impact. This would be funded \nthrough international taxation such as a 'Tobin-style' currency transaction tax to build \nup an international investment fund for children. The ILO, for example, has a plan for \nthe elimination of child labour over 20 years at a cost of US$95 million, equivalent to \nless than ten per cent of developing country debt service payments or one-fifth of their \ndefence spending.

Support for Lula has been substan- \ntially higher amongst beneficiaries than amongst those not taking part in the \nprogramme.50 \nThe temptations are obvious. With average total monthly transfers under \nBolsa Familia of almost R$5oo00 (US$230) million per month, official figures \nshow that some municipalities rely on the programme for 40 per cent or \nmore of their overall budgets. This dependence is especially marked in \npoorer Northeastern municipalities.51 It was also claimed in zoo200 that Bolsa \nFamilia could be worth up to 22 million votes for Lula in the 2006 elections.52 \nAn estimated three-quarters of Brazil's absolute poor (eight million house- \nholds, or 16 per cent of the total) now benefit in some measure from cash \ntransfers ofone kind or another. In the Northeast, one-third of households \nreceive such transfers, rising to 44 per cent in rural areas.53 Itis therefore not \ndifficult to see how this could translate into political support for the \nPresident. Given his humble origins and unrelenting public commitment \nto poverty alleviation since his inauguration, he is very much personally \nidentified with Bolsa Familia. In pre-election speeches, as well as in general \ngovernment publicity campaigns, a concerted government effort was \nmounted, perhaps understandably, to publicise the achievements of Bolsa \nFamilia nd gain maximum political advantage.54 \n49 P.

This testifies to its continuing political \nimportance domestically and ideologically as a mark of the re-casting of \nsocial policy by multilateral organisations. As the President himself noted in a \ntelevised speech to the nation, Brazil's repayment in December 2005 of its \nUS$ 5.5 billion IMF debt, saving at least US$9oo million in interest, would \nalso release funds for social programmes.58 Despite such high-profile com- \nmitments, however, there is still a long way to go in delivering comprehen- \nsive social protection to the country's poor. Brazil's first national study of \nfood security revealed recently that of the 18 million 'food insecure' popu- \nlation only 5.3 million (29 per cent) was benefited by income transfer pro- \ngrammes.59 Yet no matter how effective Bolsa Familia might or might not \neventually prove to be in terms of alleviating absolute poverty, the govern- \nment's dependence on such safety nets as a core element of its social policy \nbegs much larger questions. \na high profile area in the elections. See 'Governo acelera gastos em publicidade in- \nstitucional,', Folha de Sdo Paulo, 19 February (2006). ss For example, the major of Te6filo Ottoni declared that she had sent letters to all ben- \neficiaries of Bolsa Familia nd the 'Electricity for All' (Lu.zpara Todos) programmes in her \nmunicipality reminding people that these were the personal initiatives of President Lula. \nThis had resulted, she declared to the press, in increased political support for the President \namongst the poor.

Analysis of \ncensus data shows that whereas in 1995 earnings from employment con- \ntributed 89 per cent of poor household incomes, by 2004 this proportion had \ndropped to 48 per cent.60 In other words, over half of the income in very \npoor households in Brazil is now derived from federal cash transfers through \nlargely non-contributory programmes including Bolsa Familia and rural pen- \nsions. Some observers have identified a growing culture of dependence \nperpetuated through such safety net mechanisms. Less kind critics have re- \nnamed Bolsa Familia\/Bolsa Escola as 'Bolsa Esmola' ('charity grant' or 'beggar's \ngrant'). There is a strong risk that the perpetuation of such a hand-out \nculture through safety net policies could lead to increased clientelism as \npoliticians consciously use and manipulate these programmes as part of \nwider political and vote-capturing strategies. This would belie the 'social risk \nmanagement' component of current safety net strategies designed to address \nlonger-term development challenges. Of course, such dependence of poorer \nclasses on federal transfers has to be seen together with the massive reliance \nof the middle classes and former public sector employees upon heavily \nsubsidised state pensions, which consumes the lion's share of Brazil's social \nbudget. \nA consequence of these political distortions in public expenditure could \nbe, however, that key areas of social infrastructure such as schools and \nhospitals are starved of resources. Arguably, it is in these social welfare \nsectors where more long-term investment is necessary to build up the \nhuman capital necessary as the basis for economic growth. Perhaps it is no \ncoincidence that, while spending per annum on education and health in \nBrazil remained constant as a proportion of GDP (0.7 and 0.2 per cent \nrespectively) between 2001 and 2004, the social assistance budget grew \nfrom 0.7 to 0.9 per cent of GDP over the same period.61 Furthermore, \nBolsa Familia's share of this growing social assistance budget itself increased \nsignificantly from 26 per cent in 200zoo to 38 per cent in 2oo00 (Table I and \nFigure i). Indeed, it is becoming larger than all other federal govern- \nment education programmes, excluding higher education.62 In a growing \nnumber of Latin American countries, CCTs are becoming a cornerstone \nof social policy and there is a danger that although they do certainly represent \na creative approach to providing social assistance, 'they constitute an \n'end-run' around the more difficult ask of reforming inefficient public \n60 'Pobres se distanciam de ricos e dependem mdos do governo', Folha de Sdo Paulo, 25 \nDecember (2005). 61 Brazil, Orfamento social. 62 S.

Indeed, the World Bank itself \nnow argues vehemently for strong interventionist policies to address mass \npoverty and inequality while promoting growth.64 In future, Brazil's federal \nCCT schemes may be more closely tied to income-generating opportunities, \nas in the World Bank's 'social risk analysis' model of social protection. This \napproach is already being tried in state-level income transfer programmes \nin Brazil and has been a feature of similar schemes in Chile, Mexico and \nNicaragua.65 At the national level in Brazil, however, strategies such as \nagrarian reform, together with concomitant cross-sector policy support, are \nessential to help rebuild and sustain rural livelihoods. In addition, poverty \nalleviation must be driven by the creation of stable and decently remunerated \nemployment opportunities in both rural and urban areas. Thus, major pov- \nerty reduction in Brazil, it is argued, can only be achieved through vigorous, \njob-creating economic growth together with redistributive policies and social \ninvestment. \nBuilding progressive social policy capable of attacking the roots of poverty \nand promoting redistributive welfare remains a major challenge to policy- \nmakers. The New Social Policy model of Latin America, with its growing \nreliance on targeting and safety nets, is seen by some as an appropriate \nvehicle for reconciling growth with equity, offering an alternative to more \nregressive, traditional, institutionalised welfare service delivery mechan- \nisms.66 Despite some promising initial evidence from conditional cash \ntransfer schemes in the region, however, it remains to be seen how well the \n63 Rawlings, A New Approach toSocialAssistance, p. i i. \n64 D. de Ferranti, et al., Inequality in Latin America.
