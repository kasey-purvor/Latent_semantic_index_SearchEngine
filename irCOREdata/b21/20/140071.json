This\npaper investigates the comparability of four common measures of acquisition performance:\ncumulative abnormal returns, managers\u2019 assessments, divestment data and expert informants\u2019\nassessments. Independently each of these measures indicated a mean acquisition success rate\nof between 44%-56%, within a sample of British cross-border acquisitions. However, with\nthe exception of a positive relationship between managers\u2019 and expert informants\u2019 subjective\nassessments, no significant correlation was found between the performance data generated by\nthe alternative metrics. In particular, ex-ante capital market reactions to an acquisition\nannouncement exhibited little relation to corporate managers\u2019 ex-post assessment. This is\nseen to reflect the information asymmetry that can exist between investors and company\nmanagement, particularly regarding implementation aspects. Overall, the results suggest that\nfuture acquisitions studies should consider employing multiple performance measures in order\nto gain a holistic view of outcome, while in the longer term opportunities remain to identify and\nrefine improved metrics.\nKey Words: Mergers; Acquisitions; International; Performance; Measurement\n2Introduction\nThe choice of performance measure has long been a difficult issue facing researchers within the\norganisational field (Dess and Robinson, 1984; Glaister and Buckley, 1998; Kirchhoff, 1977).\nFinance and associated disciplines have relied on objective performance metrics such as share\nprice movements and accounting data to assess the outcome of organisational choices. Others,\nfor example organisational behaviour and strategic management, have frequently relied on\nsubjective performance indicators, including managers\u2019 self reports. In some instances the use\nof a subjective measure has been justified by difficulties in obtaining objective data, for example\nbecause the focal unit was a constituent part of a larger organisation (Dess and Robinson, 1984).\nThe selection of appropriate performance metrics is of particular relevance in inter-disciplinary\nfields such as mergers and acquisitions, where diverse origins have led to the adoption of a\nbroad range of performance measures within contemporary research (Larsson and Finkelstein,\n1999). This is especially notable within studies that have investigated the antecedents of\nacquisition outcome (King, Dalton, Daily and Covin, 2004). Some have employed subjective\nperformance assessments obtained from managers involved in the acquisition (e.g. Brock,\n2005; Capron, 1999), or from external expert informants (e.g. Cannella and Hambrick, 1993;\nHayward, 2002). Others have relied on objective measures including the acquirer\u2019s\nstockmarket returns (e.g. Carow, Heron and Saxton, 2004; Datta and Puia, 1995), or\nprofitability gains (e.g. Hitt, Harrison, Ireland and Best, 1998). Others still have focused on\nwhether the acquired firm is subsequently divested (e.g. Bergh, 1997; Porter, 1987).\nThe widespread use of alternative performance measures means prospective acquisitions\nresearchers face a dilemma when selecting an appropriate performance variable. Indeed,\nauthors of two recent meta-analyses, concerned with identifying the antecedents of\n3acquisition outcome, caution that inconsistent use of the available performance measures may\nhave held back knowledge development (King et al., 2004; Stahl and Voigt, 2004). Further,\nsome of the conflicting conclusions within the acquisitions literature may be due, in part, to\nthe adoption of different performance metrics. For example, the contradictory findings of\nDatta and Puia (1995) and Morosini, Shane and Singh (1998) on the impact of national culture\ndistance on acquisition outcome arise from studies that employed different performance\nmeasures. The role of acquisition experience is another subject characterised by differing\nresults and the use of a variety of performance metrics (e.g. Hayward, 2002; Hitt et al., 1998).\nAgainst this background, the paper presents an empirical comparison of four alternative\nmeasures of acquisition performance. The broad proposition investigated is that there is\nconvergence between the performance data generated by the alternative metrics. The findings\ncontribute to our knowledge in three areas. First, they provide insights into the comparability\nof subjective and objective measures of acquisition performance, in particular how ex-ante\ncapital market expectations relate to managers\u2019 perceptions of ex-post acquisition outcome.\nThis is relevant to the interpretation of prior acquisitions studies that have employed different\nperformance metrics. Second, the findings provide indications as to how future researchers\nmight approach the measurement of acquisition performance. Finally, the findings add\nempirical data on the mixed absolute performance of cross-border acquisitions, an\nincreasingly important form of corporate development (UNCTAD, 2000).\nThe origins and assumptions of each of the performance measures examined are summarised in\nTable 1, together with their strengths and weaknesses, and examples of studies that have\nemployed the measure.\nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE\n4Methodology\nThe study\u2019s sample comprised 61 British acquisitions of continental European firms made\nbetween 1988 and 1990, identified from Acquisitions Monthly magazine. Inclusion in the\nsample was dependent upon meeting four criteria: the purchase was of a controlling interest\n(>50%), the bid value was at least \u00a35m1, performance data were attainable using at least three\nof the metrics listed below, and the acquisition was classified as horizontal as defined by two-\ndigit SIC codes2.\nFor each acquisition in the sample, separate performance data were gathered via the following\nfour methodologies:\nCumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) were calculated from the acquiring firm\u2019s daily share\nprice movements around the announcement date of the acquisition (day 0, identified from\nAcquisitions Monthly). Standard event study methodology using the market and risk adjusted\nmodel was employed, where the abnormal return is computed as:\nARit = Rit \u2013 (ai + bi Rmt)\nWhere,\nARit = the abnormal share price return of acquiring firm i on day t\nRit = observed share price return of acquiring firm i on day t\nai = market model constant for acquiring firm i\nbi = beta of acquiring firm i\n1 Very small acquisitions were excluded consistent with recent acquisitions studies in the finance literature\nemploying abnormal returns methodology (e.g. Sudarsanam and Mahate, 2006). The final sample ranged in bid\nvalue from \u00a35m to \u00a3530m, with a mean of \u00a358m.\n2 Horizontal acquisitions provided a reasonably homogeneous environment in which to compare the performance\nmeasures. The focus on horizontal acquisitions is consistent with much of the recent strategic management\nresearch on acquisitions (e.g. Brock, 2005; Capron, 1999; Capron and Pieste, 2002; Ellis and Lamont, 2004;\nSchoenberg, 2004).\n5Rmt = share price return on the market portfolio on day t\nCoefficients a and b were estimated over a three month period (-120 to -30 days), and were\ntaken to calculate the expected returns for each security given movements in the market\nportfolio, here the FTSE All-Share Index. Abnormal returns due to the acquisition\nannouncement were determined by subtracting the actual share returns from the expected\nreturns. These were calculated over a 21 day period spanning the bid announcement (day -10 to\n+10) to provide the CAR for each acquisition. Use of a 21 day event period follows previous\nacquisitions research (e.g. Datta and Puia, 1995; Markides and Ittner, 1994), and provides an\nevent period sufficiently long to capture market reaction, yet short enough to avoid the influence\nof information unrelated to the announcement3.\nManagers\u2019 Subjective Assessments were gathered by postal questionnaire 3 to 5 years\nfollowing acquisition completion. The respondents were current executive directors of the\nacquiring firm, who had also been serving as directors at the time of the acquisition. The\nquestionnaire instrument was adapted from Datta (1991) and comprised nine performance\ncriteria4. Respondents were asked to indicate, using five point Likert scales, the importance\nassigned to each performance criterion at the time of acquisition, and the acquisition\u2019s\nperformance relative to their expectations. A \u2018weighted performance\u2019 for each criterion was\nestablished by multiplying the performance score by the importance attributed to the criterion.\nThe scale exhibited high reliability (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha=0.86) and principal components analysis\n3 Abnormal returns using a two day event period (-1,0) were also calculated for each acquisition. The use of this\ndata in the comparative analysis yielded qualitatively similar results to those obtained with the (-10, +10) CARs.\n4 The criteria were: return on investment, return on sales, asset utilisation, earnings per share; share price; cash\nflow; tax efficiency; growth in sales revenues; purchase of undervalued assets.\n6confirmed its uni-dimensionality. A single mean \u201cmanagers\u2019 assessment\u201d performance score\nwas therefore computed for each acquisition5.\nQuestionnaire responses from more than one acquiring firm director were available for 24 of the\nacquisitions. Cognisant of the limitations of relying on the response of a single manager\n(Bowman and Ambrosini, 1997), inter-rater reliabilities were calculated using Kendall\u2019s\nCoefficient of Concordance for the 24 multiple respondent acquisitions (following Hayward,\n2002), revealing a mean Concordance Coefficient of 0.73 between respondents. The high inter-\nrater reliabilities provide reassurance that the questionnaire responses captured a valid\norganisational view of acquisition performance, rather than that of one individual.\nA potential limitation of this methodology is its reliance on managers\u2019 retrospective recall of\nthe original acquisition criteria (Miller, Cardinal and Glick, 1997). The maximum five year\nrecall period adopted here is not considered excessive. First, the respondents were directors,\nwho are credited with high intellectual capabilities and thus a strong ability to recall events\n(Huber and Power, 1985). Second, acquisitions are major organisational events, which tend\nto be recalled more accurately and completely (Huber and Power, 1985). These two points,\ncombined with the high levels of inter-rater reliabilities, provide confidence towards the\nretrospective data in the present case.\nExpert Informants\u2019 Subjective Assessments were based on financial press commentary that\nappeared between two and four years post-acquisition, following methodology established by\nDatta and Grant (1990). Financial press reports on each acquisition were retrieved using the\n5 In a separate question, respondents also provided their \u201coverall\u201d rating of the acquisition\u2019s performance. The\n\u201cmanagers\u2019 assessment\u201d score, computed from the nine item scale, exhibited very high consistency with their\n\u201coverall\u201d performance rating (r=0.92; p<0.001).\n7\u201cFACTIVA\u201d database. The performance of the acquisition implied by the press commentary\nwas rated on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good) by two independent Professors of Strategic\nManagement. The Professors level of agreement was high (r=0.82; p<0.001), and their\naggregate rating was used in subsequent analysis.\nDivestment Data captured the ownership of the acquired company at 13 years post-acquisition,\nconsistent with the timeframes employed in prior research (Kaplan and Weisbach, 1992;\nMontgomery and Wilson, 1986; Porter, 1987). It was also measured at six and nine years to\ngain insight into divestment patterns and provide greater comparability with the timeframes of\nthe other ex-post performance metrics examined in this study. For each of the years, the\nacquisition was coded 0 if it was still retained by the acquiring company, coded 1 if it was\ndivested6. Ownership of the acquired firm was tracked using databases including \u201cFAME\u201d,\n\u201cFACTIVA\u201d, and \u201cWho Owns Whom\u201d. Where no, or conflicting, information was available,\nthe acquiring company was contacted to ascertain ownership of the acquired firm, and, if\ndivested, the year of divestiture.\nResults and Discussion\nPerformance of the Acquisitions\nTable 2 summarises the performance of the acquisitions using each of the four alternative\nmetrics.\nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE\n6 Defined as the divestiture of all assets and product lines of the acquired entity (Kaplan and Weisback, 1992).\n8The mean CAR for the 21 day period around the acquisitions\u2019 announcement was -0.02% (s.d.=\n6.43%), and not statistically different from zero (t = -0.02). The acquisition announcement\nproduced positive abnormal returns for the acquirer in 50% of cases, and negative returns in\n50%. These results are in line with larger studies of UK acquisitions employing short-run\nabnormal returns methodology (Sudarsanam and Mahate, 2006).\nManagers\u2019 subjective assessments reveal that 44% are dissatisfied or highly dissatisfied with\ntheir acquisitions financial performance relative to their expectations. This echoes Rostand\u2019s\n(1994) findings where 45% of acquiring managers stated that their European cross-border\nacquisitions had not met their strategic objectives.\nExpert informants\u2019 assessments classified 44% of the acquisitions as poor or very poor\nperformers.\nFinally, 11% of acquisitions in the sample were subsequently divested within six years, rising to\n30% after nine years, and 56% after 13 years7. Examination of the complete dataset showed\nthat the average time period to divestment was nine years following completion, similar to that\nreported by Montgomery and Wilson (1986). The divestment rate of 56% after 13 years is\ncomparable to that identified in US related acquisitions (Porter, 1987).\nIn summary, the absolute performance of acquisitions in this sample is similar to that reported\nby prior studies. Interestingly, irrespective of which performance metric is employed, the\noverall success rate was in the region of the widely cited 50% (Brouthers et al., 1998). The\n7 31% of the acquiring companies were themselves acquired by year 13. In just over one third of these cases the\noriginal acquisition was divested by the new owner. These divestments are included in the overall 56%.\n9paper now turns to the comparability between the performance measures, is it the same 50%\nthat are categorised as successful in all cases?\nComparability of the Performance Measures\nStatistical comparison of the four sets of performance data were undertaken using Spearman\nrank-order correlations, following Glaister and Buckley (1998) 8. The results are summarised in\nTable 3.\nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE\nHigh levels of agreement were found between managers\u2019 subjective performance assessments\nand those of expert informants. This is perhaps unsurprising given that financial journalists\nfrequently gather their information through briefings given by the acquiring managers.\nThe divestment data exhibited no statistically significant association with either managers\u2019\nsubjective assessments or expert informants\u2019 views, regardless of the time period. The\narguments of those who view divestment as a measure of acquisition performance would lead us\nto expect a strong association between managers\u2019 assessment of performance and their\nsubsequent decision to retain or divest the business (Porter, 1987). The observed weak\ncorrelations suggest this association does not hold in practice. Indeed, inspection of the data\nrelating to divestments within the first six years, i.e. broadly coincident to the time period in\nwhich the managers\u2019 assessments were collected, revealed that 29% of these divestments related\nto acquisitions that were viewed as very successful by the managers themselves (>=4.0 on the\nLikert scale). Overall, these results support the view that rather than failure, divestment in some\n8 Pearson correlations and Chi-Square statistics were also computed and produced findings consistent with the\nSpearman-based results.\n10\ninstances signals successful restructure and profitable sale (Kaplan and Weisbach, 1992), or\nappropriate resource reconfiguration in response to environmental change (Capron et al., 2001).\nFinally, the capital market\u2019s initial assessment of an acquisition, based on CAR methodology,\nexhibited no statistically significant relationship with either the objective divestment data or the\ntwo subjective performance measures. This finding is seen to reflect the contrast between the\nex-ante nature of the CAR measure and the importance of the post-acquisition integration\nperiod, captured by the three ex-post performance measures investigated here.\nThe CAR metric is based on investors\u2019 forecasts of the future cash flow consequences of an\nacquisition announcement. The lack of correlation between this measure and those\nperformance data collected ex-post supports Larsson and Finkelstein\u2019s (1999) proposition that\ninvestors may have difficulty in accurately judging the internal implementation issues that can\naccompany an acquisition. The integration phase of an acquisition is central to its outcome\n(Ellis and Lamont, 2004), but even acquiring managers have difficulty predicting all the\nissues that will arise (Very and Schweiger, 2001). For example, longitudinal research has\nrevealed that issues of cultural compatibility are frequently formalised and rise in intensity\nonly as the implementation progresses (Kavanagh and Ashkanasy, 2006). Remote external\ninvestors therefore face considerable difficulty in forecasting internal organisational matters\nthat might arise post-acquisition. This lack of insight into the implementation phase may lead\ninvestors to consistently make erroneous estimates of the future cash flow implications of an\nacquisition announcement9.\n9 These arguments assume capital market efficiency; that all information publicly available to investors is\naccurately reflected in the share price. Evidence for market efficiency is available in the finance literature, as\nreviewed by Cuthbertson and Nitzsche (2004).\n11\nConclusion\nThis study has investigated the comparability of four measures of acquisition performance.\nIndividually each measure confirmed an average success rate for cross-border acquisitions of\napproximately 50%. However, with the exception of a positive relationship between\nmanagers\u2019 and expert informants\u2019 subjective assessments, there was no comparability\nbetween the performance data generated by the alternative metrics. These results highlight the\ndangers inherent in comparing studies that have employed different performance measures.\nThis may help to explain some of the conflicting conclusions reported in the literature\nexamining the antecedents of acquisition performance.\nLooking forward, the lack of comparability suggests that future empirical work should consider\nemploying multiple measures of acquisition performance. Acquisitions impact a range of\nstakeholders in differential ways. For example, capital market investors are frequently\nconcerned with the immediate wealth effects of an acquisition announcement (King et al.,\n2004), the bidding firm with the acquisition\u2019s long-term outcome (Hitt et al., 1998), and\nemployees with anticipated job losses and acculturative stress (Cartwright and Cooper, 1990).\nAdopting multiple performance measures would facilitate a more holistic view of acquisition\noutcome that takes account of a range of stakeholders. These comments are especially relevant\nto studies that investigate the antecedents of acquisition outcome, where the current lack of\nconsistency of performance metrics is notable (King et al., 2004; Stahl and Voigt, 2004). It\nmay be insightful for such studies to employ both ex-ante and ex-post assessments, to capture\nthe initial capital market reaction and the longer-term outcome for the acquiring firm taking into\naccount the integration experience.\n12\nRegarding ex-ante measures, announcement CARs, by definition, capture the immediate\nshareholder wealth effects and investors\u2019 expectations. However, the results reported here\nsuggest that where the longer-term outcome of the acquisition is also of interest CARs need to\nbe complemented with an appropriate ex-post performance measure. This is especially the case\nwhere the research focus is on organisational or implementation factors, due to the information\nasymmetries discussed above. Future methodological studies could investigate expert\ninformants as an alternative source of ex-ante assessments, for example experienced industry\nsector analysts who hold insights into both financial and operational implications.\nIn terms of ex-post outcome, the results confirm that divestment is unlikely to be a valid\nperformance indicator. Managers\u2019 subjective assessments may provide a suitable ex-post\nmeasure, particularly where multiple respondents are utilised for each case to improve reliability\nand establish an organisational perspective. Steps should also be taken to ensure that\nrespondents are familiar with the complete history of the acquisition. If these conditions are\nmet, managers\u2019 assessments hold the advantage of providing a direct measure of outcome as\nperceived by the acquiring firm (Brouthers et al., 1998). Expert informants\u2019 provide an\nalternative subjective metric, and the correlation with managers\u2019 data points to their utility when\nthe latter cannot be obtained (e.g. due to executive departure). Again, multiple informants\nshould be employed to raise reliability.\nThe timescale of ex-post measurement is a further consideration. Sufficient time must be\nallowed for post-acquisition integration, while, for subjective measures, avoiding memory decay\nin recalling the original acquisition objectives. A review of the 9 studies cited in Table 1 as\nemploying subjective ex-post measures, revealed average elapsed times prior to data collection\nof 3 years minimum to 5 years maximum following acquisition completion. This provides a\n13\nuseful benchmark given its consistency with managers\u2019 own 2-3 year timescale for performance\ndelivery (Norburn and Schoenberg, 1994) and recommendations on the use of retrospective\nreports (Huber and Power, 1985).\nMore fundamentally, the results suggest opportunities remain to identify and refine improved\nmeasures of acquisition performance. This includes ex-ante measures (e.g. based on expert\ninformants), but applies particularly to objective ex-post indicators. For example, some have\nargued that the realisation of acquisition synergies are best reflected in long-term accounting\nmeasures (Ravenscraft and Scherer, 1989; Hitt et al., 1998). Although no accounting metric\nwas included in this comparison, due to the cross-border sample and concerns with the\ncomparability of accounting data (Meeks and Meeks, 1981; Walton, 1992), future\nmethodological studies could usefully include accounting based measures, specifically those\nwhich overcome the established difficulties in disaggregating the performance of an\nindividual acquisition from consolidated accounts (Montgomery and Wilson, 1986; Larsson\nand Finkelstein, 1999). Similarly, novel measures of synergy realisation may provide avenues\nfor future research, for example direct quantification of post-acquisition resource redeployment.\nFuture studies might also include more diverse samples than the horizontal cross-border\nacquisitions employed here, to examine whether the comparability of metrics is influenced by\nacquisition characteristics.\nWhile this study has focused on the measurement of acquisition performance, the need to\nemploy and refine valid and reliable measures, and develop consistency within\ninterdisciplinary areas, has relevance to many organisational fields (e.g. Jones and\nDimitriatos, 2004). As such this study has provided a cautionary note regarding the\ncomparability of different performance metrics and hopes to encourage further work on the\n14\ntopic.\n15\nReferences\nBergh, D.

See\nSudarsanam and Mahate (2006; appendix) for\na useful discussion on long run abnormal\nreturns methodology).\nAssumes capital market efficiency, such that\nshare price movements in response to the\nevent accurately reflect investors\u2019 assessment\nof the future cash flow implications of the\ntransaction.\nCapital market provides a fully\nobjective assessment (Lubatkin and\nShrieves, 1986).\nNo possibility of bias from firm\nexecutives, and share prices \u201csee\nthrough\u201d accounting manipulation\n(Lubatkin and Shrieves, 1986).\nShare price movements represent the\nonly direct measure of shareholder\nvalue (Lubatkin and Shrieves, 1986).\nLimited to cases where the acquiring\nfirm is publicly quoted.\nDoes not measure realised operating\nperformance, but investors\u2019 forecast\nof the future cash flow implications\nof the acquisition (Montgomery and\nWilson, 1986).\nShare price movements may reflect\nother actions of the firm extraneous\nto the event. Particularly an issue for\nlong run CARs, whose use is\ngenerally limited to large acquisitions\n(Lubatkin and Shrieves, 1986).\nResults obtained may be subject to\ntechnical aspects of the\ncomputational procedure, including\nchoice of daily vs monthly share data\n(Lukatkin and Shrieves, 1986), the\nrelevance of the benchmark market\nindex (Gregory, 1997), and the\nappropriateness of the event period\n(Lubatkin and Shrieves, 1986).\nCapron and Pistre, 2002\nCarow et al., 2004\nDatta and Puia, 1995\nGregory, 1997\nHayward, 2002\nMarkides and Ittner,\n1994\nSudarsanam and\nMahate, 2006\nManagers\u2019\nsubjective\nassessments\nOrigins in the management literature as an\noperationalisation of a multidimensional\nperformance construct (Mahoney, 1967).\nExecutives are asked to rate the extent to\nwhich their original objectives (for the\nacquisition) have been met along a number of\nspecified dimensions.\nA separate single question asking executives\nto rate their satisfaction with the \u201coverall\u201d\nAllows a composite view of\nperformance that takes into account\ndiffering management objectives\n(Brouthers et al., 1998).\nApplicable across all types of\nacquisitions.\nManagers\u2019 perceptions define their\nreality and influence their behaviour\nMay be subject to managerial bias\n(Lubatkin and Shrieves, 1986).\nAssessment may be idiosyncratic to\nthe individual manager providing the\ninformation (Bowman and\nAmbrosini, 1997).\nDependant upon accurate\nretrospective recall of respondents\nBrock, 2005\nBrouthers et al., 1998\nCapron, 1999\nDatta, 1991\nDatta and Grant, 1990\nSchoenberg, 2004\nVery et al., 1997\n20\nperformance is also frequently employed to\nestablish convergent validity (Dess and\nRobinson, 1984).\nMost commonly used to capture the\nperspective of acquiring firm management\n(Brouthers et al., 1998); some studies have\nemployed views of acquired firm executives\n(Brock, 2005; Very et al., 1997).\nData usually gathered 3-5 years after event,\nproviding ex-post assessment.\nand attitudes (Krug and Hegarty,\n2001).\nCan be utilised where objective\nmeasures are not available (Dess and\nRobinson, 1984).\n(Miller et al., 1997).\nResults may be subject to\nrespondents\u2019 familiarity with the\noriginal objectives of acquisition\n(Datta, 1991).\nExpert\ninformants\u2019\nsubjective\nassessments\nA variant of the above, this seeks the views of\nexpert informants as to the acquisition\u2019s\nperformance, typically using direct data from\nstock market analysts (Haywood, 2002), or\nindirectly via the rating of financial press\nreports and commentary (Datta and Grant,\n1990; Datta, 1991).\nProvides external assessment that is\n\u201cindependent\u201d of both management\nand capital providers.\nCan be utilised where both managers\u2019\nown assessments and objective\nperformance measures are\nunavailable (Cannella and Hambrick,\n1993).\nMay reflect the expert informant\u2019s\nsubjective bias and may be\nimpressionistic (Cannella and\nHambrick, 1993).\nData may be subject to differences in\nthe experts understanding of the\ndefinitions or bases on which they are\nmaking performance judgements\n(Cannella and Hambrick, 1993).\nCannella and Hambrick,\n1993\nDatta, 1991\nDatta and Grant, 1990\nHayward, 2002\nDivestment Origins in the industrial organisation and\nbusiness policy literature, this measure\nidentifies whether an acquired firm has\nsubsequently been divested, with divestment\ndeemed to show managements\u2019 dissatisfaction\nwith the acquisition\u2019s performance\n(Montgomery and Wilson, 1986; Ravenscraft\nand Scherer, 1987).\n\u201cThe underlying assumption is that a company\nwill generally not divest or close down a\nsuccessful business except in a comparatively\nfew special cases\u201d (Porter, 1987: 47).\n\u201cA relatively simple way to gauge\nsuccess\u201d (Porter, 1987: 47), that does\nnot require detailed financial\ninformation.\nCoarse-grained measure. Divestment\nmay indicate strategic failure (Porter,\n1987), but equally may indicate\nprofit taking following successful\nrestructure (Kaplan and Weisbach,\n1992), or appropriate resource\nreconfiguration in response to\nenvironmental change (Capron et al.,\n2001).\nBergh, 1997\nMontgomery and\nWilson, 1986\nPorter, 1987\nRavenscraft and\nScherer, 1987\n21\nTable 2: Acquisition Performance from Alternative Measures\nMeasure Mean Standard\nDeviation\n% Successful % Unsuccessful\nAnnouncement\nCARsa\n-0.02% 6.43% 50%\n(+ve CAR)\n50%\n(-ve CAR)\nManagers\u2019\nAssessmentb\n2.99 1.03 56%\n(Neut to Hi Satis)\n44%\n(Hi Disatis to Disatis)\nExpert\nInformants\u2019\nAssessmentc\n2.74 1.01 56%\n(Neut to V.Good)\n44%\n(V.Poor to Poor)\nSubsequent\nDivestment d:\n13 years\n9 years\n6 years\n(0\/1 variable) (0\/1 variable) 44%\n70%\n89%\n56%\n30%\n11%\na.
