Among many mutants of\nthe model species Streptomyces coelicolor with pleiotropic\ndefects in both aspects, this paper focuses on a mutant\ndeleted for the bldA locus, which specifies the only tRNA\nin the genome able to efficiently translate the rare leucine\ncodon UUA [1-3]. Since the complex bldA phenotype is\nlikely to involve elements of both transcriptional and\ntranslational control, it is particularly suitable for an inte-\ngrated functional genomics approach. With the aim of dis-\ncovering consequences of bldA mutation that are not\nobvious to the naked eye, we set out to analyse the RNA\nand protein extracted from a series of liquid cultures of\nisogenic bldA+ and bldA deleted strains. This allowed us to\nfocus on the effects of bldA deletion on metabolism and\noverall cell physiology without the complication of the\nunsynchronised morphological differentiation observed\nwith surface-grown S. coelicolor cultures. Our results\nrevealed unexpected effects of bldA mutation on gene\nexpression during growth and the transition phase that\nprecedes entry into stationary phase, as well as more wide-\nranging effects on secondary metabolism than previously\nsuspected, and led to further exploration of some of the\nunderpinning mechanisms. Different, but complemen-\ntary, results were obtained with the two\n\"omic\"approaches, and we conclude that there are signif-\nicant benefits from their combined application.\nResults\nGeneral characterisation of changes in the transcriptome \nand proteome during liquid culture of strain M600 (\"wild-\ntype\") and its bldA deletion derivative\nOverall strategy\nThe genome sequence of S. coelicolor [4] had been deter-\nmined with DNA from a widely-used plasmid-free deriva-\ntive (M145) of the wild-type strain A3(2). We could not\nuse M145 for the work described here, because of the\nunexpected finding that bldA mutants cannot readily be\nconstructed in M145 (M. Tao and KFC, unpublished;\nGehring et al. [5]). Instead, we used M600, a plasmid-free\nprototrophic strain that was derived from the original\nwild-type strain A3(2) by a minimally mutated route, and\nhas been used for physiological studies [6]. It proved\nstraightforward to construct a bldA deletion in M600.\nProteomic and transcriptomic analyses were done with\ncultures grown in casaminoacid-supplemented liquid\nminimal medium (SMM) to different stages (Fig. 1).\nMaterial from each culture was divided into two parts,\nwhich were processed separately for the extraction and\ncharacterisation of protein and RNA. All transcriptome\nexperiments were done using three independent time\nseries for each strain (biological replicates), and two of\nthese replicate sets of samples were used for the proteomic\nanalysis. For transcriptome analysis, genomic DNA\nlabelled with Cy-5 dCTP was used as a common reference.\nThis strategy allows the magnitude of expression to be esti-\nmated, rather than the relative expression level that is\nobtained from 'direct comparison' cDNA vs cDNA hybrid-\nisations. This enabled us to compare the level of transcript\nfor each gene with the abundance of its corresponding\nprotein product. The approach also allows transcriptome\ndata to be compared directly with other microarray data-\nsets that use genomic DNA as the common reference.\nHowever, two important caveats emerged in the course of\nthe work: first, for several technical reasons the microarray\ndata can be relatively compressed compared with results\nfrom more gene-specific analytical procedures such as\nquantitative RT-PCR or S1 nuclease protection; and sec-\nond, M600, used as the \"wild-type\" strain here, turned out\nto have a duplication of the genes SCO0021-1004 com-\npared with the M145 DNA used as the microarray refer-\nence DNA [7]. This duplication may have had some direct\neffects on levels of mRNA and proteins corresponding to\nthe duplicated genes, or indirect effects on genes else-\nwhere in the genome, but it did not affect the validity of\nthe analysis of the effects of bldA deletion described in this\npaper.\nAlthough protein samples were taken at all the time-\npoints shown in Fig 1, the labour-intensiveness of 2-D gel\nanalysis led us to confine the proteomic experiments to\nduplicate samples for each of five time-points (samples 1,\n2, 4, 6 and 8), and to use high resolution 2-D gel separa-\ntion only in the two pI ranges into which most proteins\nfall (4.5 \u2013 5.5 and 5.5 \u2013 6.7). Among the proteins\nexcluded by this approach were integral membrane pro-\nteins and extracellular proteins (both of which have been\nanalysed separately: [8,9]), proteins of less than ca.12 kDa\nor more than ca.120 kDa, and those with a basic pI\n(including many ribosomal proteins).\nDetection of 74 differentially transcribed genes\nFor the transcriptome analysis, 5,983 genes remained for\ncomparison between the strains after filtering out genes\ndeemed to be 'non-changing' because they had log2\nexpression levels between -0.667 and 0.667 in all 16 time\npoints (eight in M600, eight in \u0394bldA). Applying different\nstatistical approaches (see Methods), 74 genes \u2013 ~1% of\nall genes \u2013 were differentially transcribed between the\nwild-type and \u0394bldA mutant at the specific thresholds\napplied (Table 1 and see Additional File 1). Since previous\nwork has focussed on genes whose expression is reducedPage 2 of 22\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2007, 8:261 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/8\/261in bldA mutants, an interesting finding was that the\nexpression of 13 of the 74 genes was significantly\nincreased in the mutant strain (p-value < 0.05 and\/or\nprobability of false prediction (pfp) < 0.1 for Welch t-test\nand\/or Rank Product analysis (see Methods) respectively).\nIn order to validate the differentially expressed gene list\nindependently, 14 of the 74 genes were also analysed by\nquantitative real time PCR (Q-RT-PCR), including\nSCO6638, one of two TTA-containing genes in the list of\n74 genes (see Table 1 for list). The expression profiles gen-\nerated by the two techniques were broadly in agreement\nwith each other, exhibiting Spearman correlation coeffi-\ncients ranging from 0.54 to 0.91 (see Additional File 2).\nUnexpected effects of bldA deletion at growth stages preceding \nstationary phase, leading to the discovery of abnormal ppGpp levels \nin the bldA mutant\nSince bldA mutants grow well, but differ from the wild-\ntype most obviously in attributes expressed after the main\ngrowth period (aerial growth and secondary metabolism\n[10]), we expected to find effects of bldA deletion mainly\non stationary phase gene expression. While one-third of\nthe 74 differentially transcribed genes conformed to this\nexpectation, the rest did not (see Additional File 1): two\ngenes were most highly expressed during exponential\ngrowth in the mutant strain (SCO3088 and the putative\nRNA helicase gene SCO5166), 20 were consistently more\nhighly expressed during all phases of growth and a further\n16, encoding elements of the translational apparatus,\nshowed a transient upshift at transition phase in the wild-\ntype but not in the mutant (Table 1, see Additional File 1\nand illustrated in Fig. 2A). The tight transition phase-\ndependent expression change of the latter genes has also\nbeen seen in other wild-type strains (V. Mersinias, G.B.\nand C.P.S., unpublished data). These observations suggest\nthat, in addition to its important role in stationary phase\nbiology, bldA may also influence transcription of certain\ngenes at earlier stages, either due to an involvement of\nbldA in at least some exponential and transition phase\nprocesses, or because of some indirect effect of the loss of\nbldA on cellular physiology. Such indirect effects could\ninclude a 'shadow' cast by effects of bldA on the formation\nof the spores used to inoculate the cultures (inoculum\npreparation is known to influence the behaviour of cul-\ntures in industrial fermentations), or some kind of stress\nresponse caused by the occupation of a proportion of\nribosomes by untranslatable UUA codon-containing RNA\n(see below). For example, two of these genes (SCO4262\nand SCO6638) contain TTA codons, and translation of\nthe transcripts detected is therefore dependent on bldA.\nThe identification of these genes as being significantly dif-\nferently expressed suggests that their transcript abun-\ndance, in addition to their translation, is in some way\nbldA-dependent. The 15 differentially expressed ribos-\nomal protein genes listed in Table 1 mostly fall within one\ncluster (SCO4701-SCO4721). Further members of this\nand other ribosomal protein gene clusters appeared in the\ntop rankings of genes down-regulated in bldA compared\nto M600 but did not meet the statistical threshold criteria\napplied here. Similar extensive alterations in patterns of\nprotein abundance were not observed in the proteome\nstudy, primarily because most of the ribosomal proteins\nhave isoelectric points that lie outside those used in the\nanalysis (see Additional File 3); but in any event the\nobserved modulations in transcription may not have\nresulted in detectable changes in abundance of stable pro-\nteins such as those making up ribosomes. However, com-\nparable changes have been documented at the proteome\nlevel in pulse-chase experiments, using a different\nmedium, by Vohradsky and Thompson [11].\nThe effects on transition-phase expression of ribosomal\nprotein-encoding genes raised the possibility that the\nchanges might be mediated via ppGpp, the stringent fac-\ntor that controls transcription of rRNA and certain ribos-\nomal protein operons in E. coli and many other bacteria,\nincluding streptomycetes [6]. Previous studies had shown\nthat ppGpp concentrations increase transiently during\ntransition phase growth of S. coelicolor in SMM medium\n[12]. Since ppGpp is synthesised when an insufficient\nsupply of aminoacyl-charged tRNAs causes translation to\nstall, it was possible that stalling of ribosomes encounter-\ning a UUA codon during translation in a bldA mutant\nGrowth of S. coelicolor M600 and M600 \u0394bldA in supple-mented minimal mediumFigure 1\nGrowth of S. coelicolor M600 and M600 \u0394bldA in supple-\nmented minimal medium.

Intracellular\nppGpp concentrations were therefore analysed by HPLC\nat four comparable timepoints leading up to transition\nphase in cultures of M600 and M600 \u0394bldA similar to\nthose used for the RNA and protein analysis. The levels in\nthe bldA mutant were consistently two- to six-fold higher\nat each timepoint in the mutant than in the parent strain\n(Fig. 2B), supporting the idea that the observed large-scale\nchanges in transition-phase transcription patterns are\nrelated to altered patterns of ppGpp synthesis. GTP levels\nwere comparable between the two strains.\nThese results raise the strong possibility that some of the\nchanges in the mRNA and protein profiles resulting from\nthe deletion of bldA may be indirect effects of changes in\nthe level of ppGpp. However, such effects are unlikely to\nbe the principal reason for the most obvious features of\nthe mutant phenotype, since the deficiencies in morpho-\nlogical development and actinorhodin synthesis can be\nsuppressed by specifically replacing TTA codons in appro-\npriate regulatory genes by alternative leucine codons\n[13,14].\nAmong 102 differentially represented protein spots (corresponding \nto 84 genes), the majority are maximally abundant in stationary \nphase in the wild-type\nIn the global proteomic analysis, about 750 spots were\nsubjected to fluorescence quantification in each pI range,\ni.e. about 1,500 in all. Of these, 336 were identified by\nmass spectrometry of tryptic digests (see Additional File 4\nfor quantitative data for these identified spots). The selec-\ntion of spots for characterisation was to some extent\nguided by obvious temporal regulation, or changes in\nabundance between the two strains. 42 of the 336 spots\nwere differentially represented between the two strains\naccording to the Mann-Whitney U-test, and 35 of these\nwere also among the 95 found to be differentially repre-\nsented by a different procedure, employed to compensate\nfor a limitation of the statistical approach (discussed\nbelow). This second procedure searched for spots whose\nnormalized volumes were changed two-fold or more\nbetween strains in both biological duplicate growth\ncurves and in at least two (of the five) corresponding time-\npoints (see Methods for further details of the analytical\nprocedures). The two groups of proteins gave a combined\ntotal of 102 differentially represented spots (about 7% of\nthe c. 1500 quantified spots: see Additional File 5, and Fig.\n3). As in the transcriptome analysis, some bldA-influenced\nprotein spots (25\/102) were more abundant in \u0394bldA\nthan the parent strain, one of these (SCO3285, encoding\na large glycine\/alanine-rich protein) being detected in\nboth analyses.\nTo assess the impact of bldA mutation on proteins\nexpressed at different growth phases in the parent strain,\nthe 336 proteins were grouped into one of six temporal\nexpression pattern classes by applying a set of simple\nmathematical rules (see Methods). A summary is shown\nin Fig. 3A (see Additional File 6 for detailed lists). We\nemphasise that the bias in spot selection means that some\nof these classes are over-represented (notably class B,\nexpression mainly late) or under-represented (such as\nclass A, expression uniform throughout growth). As indi-\ncated in Fig. 3, the great majority of the spots influenced\nby bldA showed strong up-regulation in stationary phase\nin the wild-type (class B), though four examples were\nfound of a bldA-influenced spot that was more or less con-\nstitutive, echoing the evidence from microarray analysis\nthat bldA has some effects during exponential phase (class\nA).

Fig-\nure 3C shows that when a protein spot is completely\nabsent at all timepoints in both growth curves of one\nstrain, it needs to be present in at least 3 of the 5 time-\npoints in both curves of the second strain in order to be\ncalled significantly different by that procedure. Thus, the\nlargest discrepancies between the two procedures are in\nexpression group B, where protein spots may be detected\nonly in the last two timepoints, and in the group of 10\nproteins not detected at all in M600 (Fig. 3B). In total\nthese groups account for 48 of the 59 differences between\nthe two protein lists, and indicate why it was important to\nuse both differential representation assessment proce-\ndures. The reasons for the unexpectedly small overlap\nbetween the differential expression lists obtained by pro-\nteome and transcriptome analyses are discussed below.\nbldA mutation affects some proteins post-translationally\nAn unexpected new aspect of the bldA phenotype was the\nchanges observed in post-translational modification\/\nprocessing of 11 proteins (Table 2 and see Additional File\n7). Nine of these were detected as pairs of spots with sim-\nilar apparent molecular weights but differing isoelectric\npoints, and in three of the nine cases one of the two forms\nof the protein was completely absent in the bldA mutant\n(SCO1916, SCO3073, and SCO3137). The other two of\nthe 11 proteins were detected as pairs of spots differing in\nboth molecular weight and isoelectric point (SCO5465,\nSCO2271). One of the SCO5465 spots in M600, with an\napparent molecular weight of about 40 kDa, was absent\nfrom the bldA mutant, while the other, corresponding to\nthe 23 kDa predicted from its amino acid sequence, and\npresumably unmodified, was more abundant in the\nmutant. Neither of the two SCO2271 spots coincided\nSummary of results from analysis of the proteomeFigure 3\nSummary of results from analysis of the proteome.

However, SCO2271 is expected to be processed\nand exported from the cell, and the observed position of\nthe higher molecular weight spot coincides with that pre-\ndicted for the secreted protein (pH 5.9, 45 kDa). This form\nof the protein, possibly anchored in the cell membrane by\na predicted transmembrane helix at its C-terminus, was\nmore abundant in the parent strain in the stationary phase\nsamples while the smaller of the two protein spots was\napproximately equally abundant in both strains.\nSummary of global effects of bldA mutation\nIn summary, 147 genes were identified as being affected\nby bldA deletion, 63 and 73 uniquely from transcriptom-\nics or proteomics respectively (Table 1 and see Additional\nFiles 5 and 8). Eleven genes were found in both analyses\n(their transcript and protein abundance profiles are com-\npared in Additional File 9). All 147 genes are considered\ntogether in subsequent sections dealing with the effects of\nbldA deletion on secondary metabolism and with the\ngenetic routes by which some genes are affected by the\ndeletion. We also consider some evidently meaningful\neffects of the bldA deletion that were not found by the sta-\ntistical analysis.\nMutation of bldA has little effect on primary metabolic \ngenes associated with growth, but does affect some \ngenes associated with nutritional stress, as well as \nmore secondary metabolic genes than previously \nrecognised.\nPrimary metabolism\nThe growth rate of the bldA mutant in minimal media is as\nrapid as that of the wild-type (possibly it is even faster: Fig\n1; D. W. Kim and K. J. Lee, personal communication). The\nmutant was therefore not expected to show significant\nchanges in the abundance of mRNAs or proteins involved\nin primary metabolism. In general confirmation of this,\nthe major biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, nucle-\notides and vitamins were apparently unaffected, with the\nexceptions of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis\n(SCO1496, chorismate synthase; and SCO2115, one of\ntwo aroH-like genes for the first step) and biotin biosyn-\nthesis (SCO1244, 1246); and among the central pathways\nof primary carbon metabolism (glycolysis, the pentose\nphosphate pathway, the citric acid cycle, the glyoxylate\ncycle, gluconeogenesis), the only major changes seen\ninvolved increased abundance in the bldA mutant of pro-\ntein and mRNA from one of three genes annotated as glyc-\neraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (SCO7511,\ngap2) (of the two other paralogues, SCO1947 protein was\ndetected in all samples and SCO7040 was not detected in\nany). SCO7511 is orthologous with a gap gene of Strepto-\nmyces aureofaciens that was reported to be induced at the\ntime of aerial growth on glucose-free medium [17]. In\naddition, a spot comprising a fragment of citrate synthase\n(SCO2784) was enhanced in the proteome of the mutant,\nthough the major citrate synthase spot was unaffected.\nHowever, some effects were seen on more peripheral\naspects of primary and salvage metabolism, such as might\nbe expected to be active after the main growth phase. The\nmore basic of two SCO3073 (putative urocanate\nhydratase, hutU) spots was absent from the mutant; the\nproduct of a conserved hypothetical gene apparently\ntranslationally coupled to the downstream rocD (orni-\nthine aminotransferase)-like gene was less abundant in\nthe mutant; and a putative uracil phosphoribosyltrans-\nferase (SCO4041, nucleotide salvage) was likewise less\nTable 2: Changes observed in the post-translational modification of proteins as a result of bldA mutation\nGene Function1 Alteration in protein abundance2 observed for:\nSpot 1 Spot 2\nA) Spots differ in isoelectric point (pI): spot 1 has more acidic pI than spot 2\nSCO1246 BioD (dethiobiotin synthetase) >2-fold up in \u0394bldA >2-fold down in \u0394bldA\nSCO1916 Putative transferase Absent in \u0394bldA No change\nSCO2390 FabF (3-oxoacyl- [ACP] synthase II No change >2-fold down in \u0394bldA\nSCO2618 ClpP2 (Clp-protease subunit 2) >2-fold up in \u0394bldA >2-fold down in \u0394bldA\nSCO3073 HutU (urocanate hydratase) No change Absent in \u0394bldA\nSCO3137 GalE1 (UDP-glucose 4-epimerase) Absent in \u0394bldA No change\nSCO3409 Ppa (inorganic pyrophosphatase) >2-fold up in \u0394bldA >2-fold down in \u0394bldA\nSCO4164 CysA (thiosulphate supfurtransferase) >2-fold up in \u0394bldA >2-fold down in \u0394bldA\nSCO7400 ABC transport protein >2-fold down in \u0394bldA No change\nB) Spots differ in Mwt (and pI): spot 1 has higher Mwt than spot 2\nSCO2271 Putative membrane protein >2-fold down in \u0394bldA No change\nSCO5465 Conserved hypothetical protein Absent in \u0394bldA >2-fold up in \u0394bldA\n1from ScoDB [55]\n2protein abundance profiles for all 22 protein spots are detailed in Additional File 7.Page 8 of 22\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2007, 8:261 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/8\/261abundant in the mutant. Changes in the abundance of\nboth a basic and an acidic form of SCO4164, a homo-\nlogue of thiosulphate sulphurtransferase (cysA,\nSCO3920), were seen in the mutant.\nInterestingly, multiple protein forms were associated with\nten of the 17 bldA-influenced protein spots potentially\nassociated with primary\/intermediary metabolic proc-\nesses (central carbon metabolism, amino acid biosynthe-\nsis etc), suggesting that the majority of these effects may\nbe indirect subtle changes in post-translational modifica-\ntions (see Additional File 5).\nSecondary metabolism\nStreptomycetes are very important producers of antibiot-\nics and other valuable secondary metabolites. Bentley et\nal. [4] identified 21 genes or gene clusters in the genome\nsequence of S. coelicolor that are likely to determine sec-\nondary metabolite production. In our proteomic analysis,\nthe abundance of gene products from seven of these was\nfound to be affected by bldA, one of them, a Type III\npolyketide synthase (SCO7221), being more abundant in\nthe mutant (Fig. 4 and see Additional File 10). Previously,\nonly two of these gene sets (act and red) had been found\nto be influenced by bldA. In general, proteomic analysis\nhere and in previous work [18] failed to detect some of the\nproteins specified by each cluster. In most cases this\nreflected the properties of the proteins themselves (size,\ncharge, cellular location). For reasons discussed below,\nonly two of the secondary metabolism gene sets (for Act\nand coelichelin) were among those identified as being\naffected by bldA in the transcriptome analysis (see Table\n1).\nact gene cluster (SCO5070-5092)\nThe acetate-derived blue aromatic polyketide, actinorho-\ndin, whose production is encoded by the extensively stud-\nied act genes, is absent from bldA mutants. Each of the 5\nact biosynthetic transcription units was represented by at\nleast one spot in the proteomic analysis, and each showed\nstrong dependence on growth phase and on bldA (see\nAdditional File 10). Three act genes, SCO5073, SCO5074\nand SCO5079, were also identified from the transcrip-\ntome analysis. Putting these data together with previous\nless extensive results, it appears that every act biosynthetic\noperon is likely to be regulated by actII-ORF4, the path-\nway-specific regulatory gene containing the TTA codon\npreviously shown to mediate bldA-dependence of actinor-\nhodin production [14]. Most act genes were not identified\nas significantly differentially expressed by transcriptome\nanalysis, although there is compelling evidence from pre-\nvious studies that they are very markedly bldA-dependent\n[14]. Examination of the microarray data revealed exces-\nsive variance within the data for these genes (itself proba-\nbly a consequence of noticeable variation in the timing\nand onset of pigment development between replicate\nexperiments). This may be why they failed to meet the\nstringent statistical criteria employed: relaxing the criteria\nyielded more act genes (data not shown; with Rank Prod-\nuct analysis the additional act genes had associated p-val-\nues of less than 0.05 but the pfp values were above 0.1).\nred gene cluster (SCO5877-5898)\nThe red prodiginine pigments determined by the red gene\ncluster are absent from bldA mutants except under certain\nconditions (e.g. low phosphate [19]). Only one Red bio-\nsynthetic protein, the methyl transferase RedI, was\ndetected in this study. It appeared in the later time points,\nwhen redI transcripts also became more abundant. RedI\nabundance was strongly dependent on bldA, probably\nbecause of a TTA codon in redZ [19], which encodes an\natypical response regulator believed to activate a second\nregulatory gene, redD, that in turn activates at least some\nof the red biosynthetic genes [20]. Thus, the bldA-depend-\nence of RedI may reflect either a direct dependence of redI\non RedZ, or an indirect effect via RedD. As with the act\ngenes (see above), further red genes were detected as dif-\nMutation in bldA has wide-ranging effects on secondary me b lismFigure 4\nMutation in bldA has wide-ranging effects on secondary \nmetabolism.

The oxygenase encoded by SCO3236, the only pro-\ntein detected from the CDA cluster, dramatically increased\nin abundance in the parental strain during transition\nphase before falling back during late stationary phase.\nLevels of this protein were reduced in the bldA mutant.\nDeoxysugar\/glycosyltransferase cluster (SCO0381-0401)\nThese 21 genes are arranged in what could be a single\noperon, with the largest intergenic region being 102 bp\nbetween SCO0386-0387. They include two TTA-contain-\ning genes (SCO0383 and 0399), neither of regulatory\ncharacter, and neither being represented in the proteome.\nProteomics data were collected for five proteins from this\ncluster, and four were found to be reduced in abundance\nby two-fold or more in the bldA mutant. The complete\nabsence from the bldA mutant of gene products from the\nlast two genes in the cluster, SCO0400 and 0401, suggests\nthat the TTA codons in upstream genes could exert polar-\nity effects. The reduced abundance of mRNA for the first\ntwo genes in the cluster, which are upstream of the TTA\ncodons, although not statistically significant, perhaps sug-\ngests that polarity effects on protein synthesis may result\nin destabilisation of the whole message (see also below).\nType III PKS (SCO7221)\nThe Type III polyketide synthase specified by SCO7221,\nwhich has very recently been shown to be responsible for\nthe production of a germination inhibitor, germicidin\n[22], increased slightly in abundance during growth of the\nparent strain M600, peaking in the last stationary phase\nsample, but was 5- to 10-fold overproduced in the bldA\nmutant at all time-points (see Additional File 10). QRT-\nPCR confirmed that the transcript was also more abun-\ndant in the mutant strain, especially in the later time-\npoints (data not shown).\nCoelichelin biosynthetic cluster (SCO0489-0499)\nThe non-ribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by this\ncluster produces an iron-chelating metabolite, coelichelin\n[23]. Although there are no TTA-containing genes in or\nnear the cluster, the products of SCO0498 and 0499 were\nless abundant in the bldA mutant, while the products of\nSCO0490 and 0494 were unaffected. The SCO0499 gene\nwas also identified as being significantly differentially\nexpressed from the transcriptome data. Unusually among\nthe secondary metabolism-related proteins detected in\nthis work, these gene products were readily detected\nbefore the onset of stationary phase (see Additional File\n10). The presence of regulatory DNA sequence motifs sim-\nilar to iron-dependent repressor binding sites upstream of\nseveral genes in this cluster suggests responsiveness to the\nintracellular iron concentration [24]. It is not known\nwhether the effects of bldA are independent of iron-\nresponsiveness.\nDesferrioxamines biosynthetic cluster (SCO2782-2785)\nLike the coelichelin biosynthetic cluster above, the desfer-\nrioxamines cluster encodes production of an iron\nsiderophore [25], and possesses an iron-dependent\nrepressor motif upstream of the first gene in the cluster\n(SCO2782). Two proteins from this cluster were detected\nin the proteomics data from this experiment: SCO2784\nprotein was more abundant in the bldA mutant during\nsome of the early timepoints when compared to the\nparental strain, and SCO2785 shows a slightly altered pat-\ntern of expression in the mutant strain.\nRoles of regulatory and TTA-containing genes in the \nchanged patterns of gene expression in the bldA \nmutant.\nOf the 147 TTA-containing genes in the annotated\ngenome of S. coelicolor, 19 are predicted to encode regula-\ntory proteins [26]. None of these 19 proteins was detected\nby proteomics, presumably because of low abundance in\nthe growth conditions studied. However, reduced expres-\nsion of genes known to be activated by TTA-containing\nregulatory genes provided indirect evidence for the\nabsence from the bldA mutant of the regulatory proteins\nencoded by adpA (which controls SCO0762 [8]), actII-\nORF4 (which controls the act cluster genes [27,28]), redZ\n(which controls the red cluster genes via redD [20]) and\nSCO4263 (which controls SCO4251-4253: see below). In\naddition, regulatory proteins encoded by three TTA-free\ngenes were reduced in abundance in the bldA mutant, per-\nhaps accounting for at least some of the changes in gene\nexpression in the mutant. One of the three is an ArsR-fam-\nily transcriptional regulator (SCO6808), so it was interest-\ning that a motif reminiscent of the ArsR-binding site\ndetermined in E. coli [29] (see Additional File 11, motif 3)\nprecedes a group of six differentially expressed genes.\nAnother of the three is a nickel-responsive Fur-like repres-\nsor of a putative nickel transport operon (SCO4180 [30]).\nA SCO4180 deletion mutant exhibited a higher intracellu-\nlar nickel concentration than the parent [30], so bldA may\nbe similarly affected. The third (SCO4677) showed\nhomology to sensory histidine protein kinases. SCO6362,\nencoding another such kinase, was also significantly\naltered in its pattern of transcription.\nOne of many likely operons affected by bldA is the target of a \nregulator encoded by a nearby TTA-containing gene\nOf the 147 genes identified as being bldA-influenced in\nTable 1 or Additional File 5, 87 are probably co-tran-Page 10 of 22\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2007, 8:261 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/8\/261scribed with other genes [31] in a total of 59 putative\noperons. Sixteen of these operons have more than one\nmember listed in Table 1 or Additional File 5 (equivalent\nto 42 genes), reinforcing their classification as bldA-\ndependent. Apart from those involved in secondary\nmetabolism (see above), the others include a cluster of\nfunction-unknown genes whose expression was particu-\nlarly strongly dependent on bldA at the mRNA (SCO4246,\nSCO4252-3, SCO4256 and SCO4262; Fig. 5A) and pro-\ntein levels (SCO4251-3; Fig.5B) [9]. A search of the\ngenome revealed a nearby TTA-containing gene,\nSCO4263, encoding a LuxR-family regulator. The effect of\ndeleting SCO4263 on expression of the SCO4251-4253\noperon was therefore analysed. S1 nuclease protection\nexperiments indicated that transcription of SCO4253, the\nfirst gene in the putative SCO4251-4253 operon (Fig. 5C),\nstarts 32 bp upstream of the translational start site, and is\ncompletely dependent on SCO4263 (Fig. 5D, E). As a con-\ntrol, transcription of another strongly bldA-dependent\ngene, SCO0762 [8], was unaffected in the SCO4263\nmutant. Proteomic analysis also demonstrated that the\nSCO4251-4253 proteins, readily detected in the parent\nstrain, were absent from the SCO4263 mutant (data not\nshown), confirming the bldA-dependence of these three\ngenes via the TTA-containing regulator.

The stop codon of SCO6638 overlaps the\nstart site for the downstream SCO6637 gene, whose RNA\nand protein products were also less abundant in the bldA\nmutant, indicating that the two genes are cotranscribed\nand possibly translationally coupled. Possibly, a polarity\neffect on protein synthesis resulting from stalling of trans-\nlation at the SCO6638 UUA codon upstream accounts for\nreduced SCO6637 expression, and the consequent uncou-\npling of transcription and translation may further result in\nexposure of the mRNA to RNase action, in turn reducing\nthe half-life and overall abundance of mRNA correspond-\ning to both genes.

[32]). The half-life of the UUA-\ncontaining putative polycistronic SCO0991-0995 mRNA\nmay therefore also be affected by bldA-dependent uncou-\npling of transcription and translation. We note that the\ngene next to, and diverging from, the SCO0991-0995 clus-\nter, SCO0990, and also encoding a membrane protein,\nwas also bldA-dependent.\nDiscussion\nFew of the genes found to be affected by bldA contain TTA \ncodons\nSome 147 genes were found by RNA and\/or proteome\nanalysis to be affected by bldA. Further differences are\nlikely to be found when the strains are growing on the sur-\nface of agar, conditions in which the mutant forms no\nobvious aerial mycelium or spores. Some genes (31\/147)\nshowed increased expression in the bldA mutant. Of the\n47 whose protein products were found to be less abun-\ndant in the mutant, only one (SCO6638) has a TTA\ncodon. [Only one other protein among those seen on gels\nwas specified by a gene (SCO6717) annotated as TTA-con-\ntaining, and closer examination of the SCO6717 sequence\nindicates that the TTA codon falls upstream of a likely\ntranslation start codon.] The gels examined contained\nabout 1500 different protein spots. Based on a reported\naverage of 1.2 spots per gene [18], these correspond to\nabout 1250 genes, i.e. about 16% of the genome. The\nproducts of the TTA-containing genes in the S. coelicolor\ngenome (147 in the analysis of Li et al. [26]) are therefore\nstrikingly under-represented in our analysis. Thus, the\ngrowth conditions used here (submerged growth in\ncasaminoacids-supplemented minimal medium) did not\nfavour the expression of most of these genes. This would\nbe consistent with the idea that many TTA-containing\ngenes are adapted for expression either during surface\ngrowth and differentiation, or in specialised ecological\nniches or physiological responses. A similar conclusion\nwas reached by Li et al. [26], in a study in which mutations\nin 21 TTA-containing genes of S. coelicolor were found to\ncause no obvious phenotypic changes. Since nearly all of\nthe genes that seemed to be influenced by bldA in our\nanalysis lack a TTA, these effects must have been indirect.\nThree indirect routes probably account for most of the\neffects (Table 3). First, some of the bldA-influenced genes\nare regulated by TTA-containing genes, most of which are\nexpressed at levels too low to make them amenable to the\nanalytical procedures employed. We estimate that\ndependence on such weakly-expressed TTA-containing\ngenes accounts for the bldA-dependence of at least 15\ngenes found in the transcriptome and proteome analyses.\nThe upstream sequences of the genes with differentially\nexpressed transcripts were analysed to identify over-repre-\nsented DNA motifs that may be indicative of co-regula-\ntion of genes by the same regulatory protein, and the ten\nstatistically most significant motifs are shown in Addi-\ntional File 11. None resemble binding motifs reported or\nproposed for the S. coelicolor regulators encoded by TTA-\ncontaining genes i.e. AdpA [8], ActII-ORF4 [33], RedZ\n(White and Bibb, personal communication), or previ-\nously reported consensus promoter sequences in S. coeli-\ncolor. Secondly, eight of the genes affected are probably co-\ntranscribed with TTA-containing genes, and the resulting\nUUA-containing mRNAs may have a reduced half-life\nunder conditions in which the UUA codon is not readily\ntranslated. Thirdly, bldA deletion changes the profile of\nppGpp abundance and eliminates a transient upshift in\ntranscription of ribosomal protein genes at the transition\nphase that precedes entry into stationary phase (see Fig.\n2A). This extraordinary effect may arise through a trigger-\ning of the stringent response, because of ribosomes\nencountering untranslatable UUA codons in a small pro-\nportion of mRNAs. It is likely that the changed ppGpp lev-\nels will affect the expression of some genes even before\ntransition phase, and that the disturbance of transition\nphase gene expression will have knock-on effects on gene\nexpression during stationary phase, the stage at which\nmost of the known phenotypic consequences of bldA\nmutation are manifested.\nSignificant global correlation between protein and transcript abundanceFigure 6\nSignificant global correlation between protein and transcript \nabundance.

Nevertheless, using the Spearman Rank correlation\nas detailed in the Methods, there was a weak but signifi-\ncant global correlation at the 5% level between the pro-\nteome and transcriptome values at each time-point, with\ncorrelation coefficients ranging from 0.15 to 0.34 for\nwild-type timepoints 8 and 1, respectively, and 0.13 to\n0.34 for the corresponding times in \u0394bldA (Fig. 6).

However, at least 53 of the 74 signifi-\ncantly differentially transcribed genes encode proteins\nthat are predicted to be undetected in the 2D gel proteom-\nics approach employed, because of their physical proper-\nties (basic pI, low molecular weight (<13 KDa), multiple\ntransmembrane domains or putative secretion: (see Table\n1)). Indeed, four of the genes in Table 1 that encode puta-\ntively secreted protein products (SCO0297, 0762, 1968\nand 6198) and are down-regulated in bldA, were reported\nto be less abundant in the mutant extracellular proteome\n[8]. Taking this into account, there were ten discrepancies\ninvolving failure of the proteome analysis to find genes\npicked out in the transcriptome study, and this may be\nassociated with limitations of the proteomics approach\nfor detecting proteins of low abundance. In addition, the\nhigher number of replicates and sampling points in the\ntranscriptomics study will have increased the power of\nthis analysis for determining statistically significant\nchanges. Some changes in the proteome were not picked\nup by transcriptome analysis. Many of these may reflect\neither post-translational processes of potential physiolog-\nical significance (e.g. proteins in Table 2), or differing sta-\nbilities of the mRNA and corresponding protein products\nof gene expression. Thus, there are real benefits in using a\ncombination of proteome and transcriptome analyses to\nassess global gene expression, where limitations in one\ntechnique tend to be compensated by strengths of the\nother. Because of its sensitivity and genuinely global\nnature, the transcriptome approach captures data on\nlowly expressed genes, and on secreted, membrane or\nhigh molecular weight gene products, which are all poorly\nrepresented in whole-cell proteomics data. Proteomics on\nthe other hand informs on the abundance of the end-\nproduct of gene expression, encompassing the effects of\nboth post-transcriptional and post-translational regula-\ntory mechanisms that cannot be glimpsed through tran-\nscriptomics.\nConclusion\nThe role and evolution of a bldA-based checkpoint for \nStreptomyces differentiation\nTaking into account the sum total of information now\navailable about the effects of bldA mutations, and the\noccurrence and nature of TTA-containing genes in strepto-\nmycetes, we suggest the following bldA-centred model of\nStreptomyces physiology.\nNutrient-limited conditions in most bacteria, including\nstreptomycetes, are signalled through a mechanism\ninvolving ppGpp that generally results in decreased pro-\nduction of the machinery for macromolecular synthesis,\nincluding tRNAs. In the case of streptomycetes, such con-\nditions may apply either when the environment changes,\nor in centrally located parts of the colony in which nutri-\nent demands have come to outstrip the rate at which exter-\nnal supplies can diffuse in. It is in the latter parts of the\ncolony that morphological and physiological differentia-\ntion take place. The transcription of the bldA-specified\npro-tRNA and its processing to a mature form are\nincreased in these conditions, as if bldA responds to nutri-\nent limitation in the opposite way from other transla-\ntional components. Indeed, nutritional shiftdown-\ninduced increases in ppGpp concentration that strongly\ninhibited transcription of the rrnD geneset for 16S rRNA\ndid not inhibit bldA transcription and processing [34].\nA relative increase in the level of bldA tRNA provides an\nintracellular environment suitable for the translation of\nUUA-containing mRNA. In view of our evidence suggest-\ning that such mRNAs have reduced abundance when the\ntranslation of their UUA codons is restricted, their free\ntranslation would increase the abundance of the mes-\nsages, potentially further increasing the levels of the pro-\ntein products. This enhancement may apply to individual\nstructural genes or whole operons (such as the deoxysugar\ncluster SCO0381-0401), causing rapid changes in the\nactivity of the corresponding biochemical activities and\npathways. Such pathways nearly all show some degree of\nspecies-specificity, and many of them probably confer\nadaptive benefits in very particular environmental circum-\nstances [26]. The enhancement should also apply to the\nexpression of TTA-containing regulatory genes. Some of\nthese activate pathway gene sets for antibiotic biosynthe-\nsis, and one, adpA, activates some critical aspects of mor-\nphological differentiation, at least partially by influencing\nan extracellular protease cascade [8]. Others activate\nother, often still uncharacterised, gene sets (such as the\nSCO4251-4253 operon). We presume that many of the\nprocesses showing some dependence on bldA are also sub-\nject to other regulatory influences, and that the role of\nbldA is to provide one of possibly several checkpoints that\nmust be achieved before commitment to particular physi-\nological activities, such as the onset of secondary metabo-\nlism or the activation of substrate mycelium autolysis that\nis associated with reproductive aerial growth.\nIf exposure of UUA-containing mRNA to ribosomes lim-\nited for bldA tRNA elicits ppGpp synthesis as our results\nsuggest, this could reduce the efficiency of transcription of\nany genes adapted for expression in conditions favouring\nvery rapid growth. Many bacteriophage genes have such\nadaptations. It could be imagined that the presence of\nUUA codons in highly expressed genes of Streptomyces\nphages would reduce the effective expression levels ofPage 15 of 22\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2007, 8:261 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/8\/261such genes, providing a possible selective route for the\nevolution of the bldA checkpoint.\nMethods\nStrains, growth conditions and sampling\nS. coelicolor M600 is a prototrophic, plasmid-free strain of\nS. coelicolor A3(2) [6]. In the M600 \u0394bldA strain, kindly\nprovided by M. Tao, bldA is completely replaced by an\napramycin resistance cassette. Strains were cultivated with\nvigorous agitation at 30\u00b0C in minimal medium supple-\nmented with 0.2 % casamino acids (SMM) as previously\ndescribed [35]. In summary, spores (about 1010 colony-\nforming units ml-1) were pre-germinated in 2 \u00d7 YT\nmedium [35] for 7 h at 30\u00b0C. Germlings were harvested\nby centrifugation (5 min at 4000 \u00d7 g), resuspended in\nSMM, and briefly sonicated to disperse any aggregates,\nbefore inoculation into 50 ml of SMM in 250 ml silicon-\nised flasks containing coiled stainless steel springs. Each\nflask received the equivalent of 5 \u00d7 107 colony-forming\nunits. Growth curves for producing RNA and protein\nextracts to compare M600 and M600 \u0394bldA strains were\nperformed in triplicate, with 35-ml samples being taken\nfrom cultures of each strain at eight culture ages encom-\npassing the exponential, transition and stationary phases\n(Fig. 1). Typically, 10 ml of each sample was used for RNA\nextraction and 25 ml for proteomic analysis. All samples\nfrom all three time-series were subjected to transcriptome\nanalysis, while for logistical reasons only samples 1, 2, 4,\n6 and 8 from two of the time-series were analysed using\nproteomics.\nTranscriptomics Methods\ni) Genomic DNA and RNA extraction\nM145 genomic DNA was prepared by the 'Kirby mix'\nmethod described in Kieser et al. [35], except that sarkosyl\nreplaced TPNS as the detergent. To retain RNA content\nand integrity, the mycelium from each 10 ml culture sam-\nple was treated with RNA Protect Bacteria Reagent (Qia-\ngen), following the manufacturers' recommendations,\nand then stored at -20\u00b0C. The procedure used for RNA\nextraction was as described at [36] employing RNeasy\npurification columns from Qiagen. The RNA was eluted in\na final volume of 250 \u03bcl, assessed for structural integrity\nusing a Bioanalyser system (Agilent Technologies), and\nquantified spectrophotometrically using a NanoDrop\nND-1000 instrument (Labtech). The A260\/A280 absorption\nratios of the extracted RNA were between 1.8 and 2.\nii) Nucleic acid labelling and microarray hybridization\nThe procedures for genomic DNA labelling and array\nhybridizations were as described at [36]. Briefly, for the\ncDNA synthesis and labelling, 15 \u03bcg of total RNA was\nadded to a reaction mixture containing random hexamer\nprimers (Invitrogen), Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase\n(Invitrogen) and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare), and the mix-\nture was incubated at 42\u00b0C for 2\u20134 h. For the labelling of\ngenomic DNA, ca. 3 \u03bcg DNA was labelled in a 50 \u03bcl reac-\ntion volume with Klenow enzyme and Cy5-dCTP. The\nincorporated Cy-dye-dCTP was quantified using a Nano-\ndrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. A volume equivalent\nto 45 pmol of Cy3-dCTP-labelled cDNA was pooled with\n20 pmol of Cy5-dCTP-labelled genomic DNA, dried in a\nvacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 45 \u03bcl of Pronto!\nUniversal Hybridisation Solution for long oligos and\ncDNA (Corning). For the array hybridisations of biologi-\ncal replicates 1 and 2, a salt-based hybridisation solution\nwas used instead of a formamide-based solution [37].\nThe microarrays were coated glass slides (Corning GAPS II\nfor replicates 1 and 2 and Corning UltraGAPS for replicate\n3) spotted with PCR amplicons covering ca. 92% of S. coe-\nlicolor ORFs. The array design and layouts used are\ndescribed at [36]. Different array layout and print runs\nwere used in this work: for the biological replicates 1 and\n2 the arrays contained one probe spot for each gene (array\nbatches Sc9 and Sc10) while the arrays for the third bio-\nlogical replicate contained duplicate probe spots (batch\nScp28). Microarrays were scanned using an Affymetrix\n428 dual laser scanner. The microarray spots were ana-\nlysed and quantified using BlueFuse software (Version\n3.1; BlueGnome Ltd, Cambridge), which uses statistical\nparametrical models for accurate quantification of the\nspot signal and background noise.\nProteomics Methods\ni) Preparation of protein extracts from cultures\nMycelium was harvested from 25ml samples of cultures\nby centrifugation (30 sec, 4000 \u00d7 g, room temperature)\nand immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, with a transfer\ntime from culture flask to frozen sample of 1.5 minutes.\nMycelial pellets were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Protein\nextracts, prepared as in Hesketh et al. [18], dissolved in\ndenaturing isoelectric focusing buffer UTCHAPS (7 M\nurea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w\/v) CHAPS, 50 mM DTT, 4 mM\nPefabloc SC protease inhibitor, and 40 mM tris pH9.0),\nwere stored frozen in aliquots at -80\u00b0C.\nii) 2D gel separation of proteins, spot quantification and spot \nidentification\nProtein extracts were subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis\nover the pH4.5-5.5 or pH5.5-6.7 isoelectric point ranges\nas detailed in Hesketh et al. [18]. For quantitative analysis\nof protein abundance profiles, gels were stained with\nSypro Ruby (Bio Rad) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions, and scanned using the Perkin-Elmer ProX-\nPRESS proteomic imaging system using excitation and\nemission wavelengths of 480 nm and 630 nm, respec-\ntively. To produce a quantitative analysis of protein abun-\ndance profiles, gel images were analysed using PHORETIX\n2D version 5.1 (NonLinear Dynamics): spot detection wasPage 16 of 22\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2007, 8:261 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/8\/261optimised automatically using the 'Spot Detection Wiz-\nard' and then manually edited; background subtraction\nwas performed automatically using the 'Mode of Non-\nSpot' setting; and images were then normalised to the\ntotal spot volume for each gel for quantification. Spot fil-\ntering was not used, although all spots were manually\nedited. Histograms of normalised spot volumes display-\ning changes in spot abundance during growth and\nbetween M600 and the \u0394bldA mutant were generated\nwithin the software. Protein spots of interest were excised\nfrom Sypro Ruby-stained gels using the Investigator\nProPic robot from Genomic Solutions, and identified by\ntryptic digestion and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry as\npreviously described [18]. Identification of proteins from\npeptide mass fingerprint data was performed using the\nMatrixScience 'Mascot' search engine [38], and was based\non their 'Probability Based MOWSE Score' algorithm. A\nMOWSE score of 60 or higher is significant at the 5% level\nor better, and proteins in this work typically gave scores >\n80 (frequently considerably higher). In addition, no iden-\ntification was accepted unless at least 5 peptides represent-\ning at least 20% of the protein sequence were detected in\nthe MALDI-ToF peptide mass fingerprint. Spots selected\nfor identification included not only those showing signif-\nicant differences between strains (using the non-statistical\napproach outlined below), but also some exhibiting only\ngrowth-phase dependent changes in abundance, and a\nsmaller number of landmark spots that were neither\ngrowth-phase nor strain dependent.\nPreprocessing of -omics data\nMicroarray data\nFor normalization methods the statistical computing\nenvironment R (Version 2.1.1) [39] and the package\nLimma [40] were used. Within-array global median nor-\nmalisation of log2 cDNA\/gDNA ratios was applied to the\ndata from each array in the analysis. Control and flagged\nspots were ignored. The log2 ratios were then scaled to\nhave the same median-absolute-deviation (MAD) across\narrays [40,41] of the same replicate series (I, II and III).\nOnly un-flagged data (6,457 genes) were used in differen-\ntial expression analyses and in the averaging of replicate\ndata for the transcriptome-proteome correlation analysis.\nProteomics data\nThe proteomics data were analysed using both statistical\nand mathematical approaches. For the mathematical\nmethods, normalized spot volumes as generated within\nthe Phoretix 2D software (see above) were used without\nfurther processing. For all statistical analyses, these nor-\nmalized spot volume measurements were transformed to\nthe log2 scale, with an arbitrary value of 1 being assigned\nprior to transformation to protein spots too low in abun-\ndance to be detected.\nPublic availability of -omics data\nThe transcriptome data have been deposited in the\nMIAME-compliant ArrayExpress database with accession\nnumber E-MAXD-27 [42]. Proteome data are listed in\nAdditional File 4 as an Excel file of normalised spot vol-\numes for all 336 identified spots.\nData analysis\nTranscriptomics: genes expressed differentially between strains\nThe choice of analytical method when compiling a list of\ndifferentially expressed genes between conditions is\ndependent on numerous factors [43]. For the transcrip-\ntomic data two independent methods were used: Welch t-\ntest and Rank Product analysis [44]. Whilst t-test based\napproaches are commonly used for analysing microarray\ndata it is apparent that when there is large variance\nbetween biological replicates (as is the case with Strepto-\nmyces cultures) and\/or crucial single time-point changes\n(in this analysis), the t-test has shortcomings [[43,44], this\nstudy]. Consequently, the more 'biology friendly' tech-\nnique of Rank Products [44] was also used. Comparison\nof the gene lists produced when applying the respective\nthresholds (Welch t-test p-value < 0.05, Rank Product pfp\nvalue < 0.1) revealed little overlap between them. Hence,\nto avoid biasing any interpretation of the results the lists\ngenerated by the two techniques were combined.\nWelch t-test\nThe preprocessed data were imported into Genespring 7.2\n(Agilent technologies) for further analysis and genes\ndeemed to be 'non-changing' were filtered out from the\nun-flagged transcriptome data by removing those with\nlog2 expression values between -0.667 and 0.667 in all 16\ntime points (eight in M600, eight in \u0394bldA). The remain-\ning 5,983 genes were then analysed for significant (p <\n0.05) differential expression between M600 and \u0394bldA\nusing the Welch t-test and Benjamini and Hochberg mul-\ntiple testing correction [45].\nRank Product analysis\nThe preprocessed data (6,457 genes) were imported into\nR (Version 2.1.1) [39] for analysis using the RankProd\npackage [46] with default parameters. Though the micro-\narray data produced in this study are two-colour, the use\nof a genomic reference allowed the use of the RankProd\npackage analagously to one-colour data, the values com-\npared being log2 expression ratios of sample_cDNA\/\ngDNA. Thus, to compare the bldA mutant to M600 at a\nparticular time point six expression ratios were used, three\nfrom the mutant and three from M600. Rank products\n(and associated p-values, probability of false prediction\n(pfp) values and average fold-change) for both up- and\ndown regulation were then calculated by using ranks for\neach pairwise comparison of bldA\/M600 (i.e. bldA_repA\/\nM600_repA, bldA_repA\/M600_repB, bldA_repA\/Page 17 of 22\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2007, 8:261 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/8\/261M600_repC etc). This was repeated for each time-point,\ncomparing the bldA mutant replicates with their respective\nM600 counterparts. Differentially expressed up- and\ndown-regulated genes were selected if their corresponding\npfp value was \u2264 0.1.\nProteins represented differentially between strains\nTo test statistically for proteins represented differentially\nbetween M600 and \u0394bldA the non-parametric Mann-\nWhitney U-test was applied, comparing the data based on\ntheir ranks rather than absolute values. All 336 protein\nspots were tested for significance of differences between\nstrains, with p-values being corrected by the Benjamini\nand Hochberg procedure. Differences were deemed signif-\nicant if the corrected p-value was less than 0.05. It was evi-\ndent that using these stringent criteria has the potential to\nlose interesting data, particularly spots absent in one\nstrain and developmentally regulated in the other, since\nany protein spot completely absent from one would have\nto be present in at least three of the five time-points of the\nsecond strain to be called significantly different (based on\nsimulations, see below). An additional complementary\nmathematical analysis was therefore undertaken in which\nprotein spots were considered to be differentially repre-\nsented between strains if their normalized volumes were\nchanged two-fold or more in both biological duplicate\ngrowth curves in at least two (of the five) corresponding\ntime points. The results from both approaches were ulti-\nmately combined to produce a master list of differentially\nrepresented proteins, with presence and absence of corre-\nsponding P-values indicating which protein spots were\nfound in the statistical and mathematical analyses, respec-\ntively.\nClassification of proteins according to their abundance profiles in \nM600\nNormalized spot volume measurements for strain M600\nsamples over time for all 336 identified proteins were\ngrouped into one of six abundance profile classes by\napplying the following set of simple mathematical rules.\nIf in each replicate the largest value is less than or equal to\nthe smallest value multiplied by 2, place into Group A\n(approximately equal abundance). If this is true only for\none replicate, place in Group F (approximately equal\nabundance at each timepoint in one growth series, but not\nthe other). The remainder exhibit two-fold or more\nchanges in abundance in both replicates, and are placed\ninto Group B if they reproducibly exhibit increasing abun-\ndance with time, Group C for those decreasing in abun-\ndance with time, and Group D for those with an initial\nincrease followed by a decrease. Any remaining are placed\nin Group E (changing, but no reproducible trend). Ten of\nthe 336 spots were not seen in M600 but were detected in\nthe bldA mutant, and are given a separate class.\nCorrelation between transcriptome and proteome\nSpearman Rank correlation was used to compare the tran-\nscriptome and proteome mainly because it avoids scaling\nissues. As a non-parametric method, using the ranking of\nvalues to compute correlation Spearman rank also allows\nthe use of arbitrary values representing very low abun-\ndance proteins. Thus, the Spearman rank correlation r\nbetween transcript and protein was calculated by\nwhere d is the difference between the ranks of protein and\ntranscript data in sample s and N is the number of sam-\nples.\nTo test whether the observed Spearman rank correlation\ncould be obtained by chance a t-test was calculated by\nThe resultant t-statistic was then converted to a p-value\nbased on the t-distribution. All p-values were then cor-\nrected by application of the Benjamini and Hochberg\nmultiple testing correction procedure [39,45,47] and were\nclassed as significant if p < 0.05. Correlation between tran-\nscriptome and proteome data was computed for each of\nthe 5 time-points in each strain (a vector of 310 in each\ntest) and for each gene across five time-points in M600,\nfive time-points in \u0394bldA and ten time-points across both\nM600 and \u0394bldA. Analysis was only performed on 310\nprotein spots, as the other 26 spots did not have corre-\nsponding genes that passed through the stringent filtering\napplied to the transcriptome data. Where multiple protein\nproducts were identified from a single gene the correla-\ntion was calculated using the transcriptomic data for that\ngene versus proteomic data for each individual protein\nspot (i.e. multiple spots were not averaged or summed),\nbecause of the possibility that not all spots for any one\ngene product were detected.\nIdentification of DNA motifs upstream of differentially expressed \ngenes\nInitial searches for conserved sequence motifs were con-\nducted on the genes whose transcription was shown\ndirectly by Welch t-test analysis of microarray data to be\ninfluenced by bldA. A sequence set was constructed con-\nsisting of 500 nt segments (300 nt upstream and 200 nt\ndownstream of the translational start codons) of each\ngene, in the correct transcriptional orientation (based on\nthe annotated S. coelicolor genome GenBank\n(AL645882)). The sequence set was submitted to the\nMEME (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation) server [48],\nr\nd\nN N\ng s\ns\nN\n= \u2212\n\u2212\n\u22111 6\n1\n2\n2\n,\n( )\nt\nr\nr\nN\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n1\n2\n2Page 18 of 22\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2007, 8:261 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/8\/261applying default settings except for: minimum width of\nthe motif to search for was set to 5 nts; maximum width\nto 30 nts; and maximum number of sites to find was set to\n10. From the MEME output file an IUPAC consensus\nsequence was constructed for each motif. To estimate the\ndistribution of each motif (i.e. how many genes in the\ngenome have this motif in their upstream regions) the\nMEME-derived consensus sequence was used to search the\nS. coelicolor genome sequence for hits within the upstream\nregions of all genes (as defined above) using the genome-\nscale dna-pattern tool of RSAT (Regulatory Sequence\nAnalysis Tools; [49]) with default settings except that one\nnucleotide substitution was allowed.\nConstruction of a SCO4263 deletion mutant\nA mutant SCO4263 allele, in which the entire coding\nregion was replaced by an apramycin resistance cassette,\nwas constructed by PCR-targeting essentially as described\nby Gust et al. [50]. Briefly, oligonucleotide primers (5'-)\nwith 5' ends homologous to the 5' and 3' ends adjacent to\nthe SCO4263 coding sequence, and 3' (priming) ends\ndesigned to amplify the apramycin resistance disruption\ncassette, were used in a PCR with pIJ773 as template. The\nPCR product was introduced into E. coli BW25113\/pIJ790\ncontaining cosmid StD86A [51], preinduced for \u03bbred\nfunctions by the addition of arabinose, to obtain a\nSCO4263-disrupted version of the StD86A cosmid. The\ndisrupted cosmid was introduced into E. coli ET12567\/\npUZ8002 by transformation, then transferred into S. coe-\nlicolor M600 by conjugation. Exconjugants were selected\non MS agar [35] containing apramycin, and the products\nof double crossovers identified by screening for kanamy-\ncin sensitivity. Deletions were confirmed by PCR and\nSouthern blotting.\nQuantitative real-time PCR analysis of selected differentially \nexpressed genes\nSpecific primers and probes for 14 of the 74 selected dif-\nferentially expressed genes (SCO6808, SCO7657,\nSCO4295, SCO5013, SCO3088, SCO3285, SCO3286,\nSCO5166, SCO6958, SCO6638, SCO4648, SCO4702,\nSCO4705, SCO4717) were designed using either Primer\nExpress v.2 software (Applied Biosystems) or Primer 3\nsoftware [52]. Five \u03bcg samples of each of the 16 RNA prep-\narations from replicate 3 were subjected to RNase-free\nDNase I treatment (Promega) in a 20 \u03bcl reaction volume.\nOne \u03bcg of RNA was used as template for cDNA synthesis\nwith 225 ng of random hexamers (Invitrogen) and 50\nunits of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in\n20 \u03bcl reaction volumes, and incubated for 10 min at\n25\u00b0C, 50 min at 42\u00b0C and then 15 min at 70\u00b0C. The sam-\nples were diluted 1:4 with distilled water and 5 \u03bcl was\nused in the quantitative PCR reaction with 10 pmol of for-\nward and reverse primer and 2.5 pmol of FAM\/TAMRA\ndual-labelled specific probe (Operon technologies) in 25\n\u03bcl master mix (QPCR ROX, ABgene). Parallel reactions\nwere performed in the same 96-well plate using different\ndilutions of genomic DNA in order to generate a standard\ncurve for each selected gene. The reactions were analysed\nin an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System\n(Applied Biosystems).\nS1 nuclease mapping\nRNA was isolated from exponential and transition-phase\ncultures as described by Strauch et al. [12]. For each S1\nnuclease reaction 20 \u03bcg RNA was hybridised in NaTCA\nbuffer [53] to about 0.2 pmol (approximately 105 Cer-\nenkov counts min-1) of each of the following radiola-\nbelled probes. For SCO4253, the oligonucleotide 5'-\nGACCGACGAAGGCCGCCACCGA-3', which anneals\nwithin the SCO4253 coding region, was uniquely end-\nlabelled at its 5'- end with [\u03b3-32P]-ATP using T4 polynucle-\notide kinase. This was used in the PCR together with the\nunlabelled probe 5'-GATCTGACCGATCCTCCT-\nGACACGCCGTCACCGT-3' (which anneals upstream of\nthe SCO4253 gene) and cosmid StD49 as template, to\ngenerate a 432 bp probe. PCR was performed in the pres-\nence of 7% dimethylsulphoxide using the following con-\nditions: 94\u00b0C for 4 min followed by 26 cycles of 45 s at\n94\u00b0C, 45 s at 58\u00b0C and 60 s at 72\u00b0C, then held at 72\u00b0C\nfor 5 min to finish. The probe for SCO0762 was made in\na similar way, but using 5'- AGGCGATCCTAGTCGAT-\nCAAGAAACGCCCAGTTC-3' as the unlabelled primer, 5'-\nTCTCTCCGTGCCCCACGGTCAGCA-3' as the labelled\nprimer, and cosmid StF81 [51] as template. This produced\na 365 bp uniquely end-labelled probe product. Hybridisa-\ntions were carried out at 45\u00b0C for 14 h after denaturation\nat 65\u00b0C for 15 min. S1 nuclease digestions and analyses\nof RNA-protected fragments were performed as described\npreviously [54]. High-resolution mapping of the tran-\nscription start site of SCO4235 was achieved by generat-\ning a sequencing ladder with the same labelled primer as\nwas used for the probe, using a Thermo Sequenase cycle\nsequencing kit (USB) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions.\nQuantification of ppGpp and intracellular nucleotides\nExtraction and HPLC analysis of ppGpp, ATP and GTP\nfrom S. coelicolor cultures were carried out as described by\nStrauch et al.
