According to the Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) > 220 mil-\nlion poultry have been culled since the end of\n2003 to control the spread of the virus (FAO\n2006). The World Health Organization\n(WHO) confirmed 41 human deaths from\navian influenza A (AIA) H5N1 in 2005, and\n74 people have already died in 2006, more\nthan twice the pace of the previous year\n(WHO 2006a, 2006b). The current state of\nalert provides an unprecedented opportunity\nfor the global community to devise strategies\nto decrease mortality rates in the event of pan-\ndemic influenza. An integral component of\nthese strategies is the manufacture of an effec-\ntive vaccine. However, this cannot be pro-\nduced until the emergence and identification\nof the pandemic influenza strain (McKimm-\nBreschkin et al. 2003). During the time it will\ntake to prepare a vaccine, the WHO (2006)\nrecommends Tamiflu [oseltamivir phosphate\n(OP); Figure 1] for the treatment and pre-\nvention of pandemic influenza. Tamiflu, pro-\nduced and marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche\nInc. (Nutley, NJ, USA), is a rationally\ndesigned selective inhibitor of influenza A\nand B neuraminidase (NA) (Kim et al. 1997;\nLi et al. 1998; von Itzstein et al. 1993). After\nabsorption in the gastrointestinal tract,\nTamiflu is converted to the active NA\ninhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) by\nhepatic esterases (Figure 1, Table 1). OC\nbinds tightly to the highly conserved active\nsite of the viral NA (Air and Laver 1989;\nBaker et al. 1987), thereby inhibiting the\naction of the enzyme that is needed for release\nof progeny virions from the surface of infected\ncells (Bardsley-Elliot and Noble 1999; Palese\nand Compans 1976). \nStockpiles of Tamiflu have been amassed\nby many nations worldwide to be used in the\nevent of an influenza pandemic (in millions\nof treatment courses): Belgium, 3; France,\n14; Germany, 16; Greece, 0.2; Italy, 30;\nNetherlands, 5; New Zealand, 0.84; Russia,\n150; Spain, 10; United Kingdom, 14.6; and\nUnited States, 81 (BBC 2006). The WHO\nand the United States have stockpiled an addi-\ntional 5\u20136 million courses combined for the\npurpose of \u201cblanketing\u201d regions upon confir-\nmation of an outbreak (F. Hoffman-La Roche\nLtd. 2006). The ring or blanketing prophy-\nlaxis strategy, an approach for delivering large\namounts of antiviral drugs to people within a\ndefined area surrounding a limited localized\ninfluenza outbreak, will greatly increase the\noverall use of Tamiflu in a region compared\nwith earlier strategies that aimed to treat only\nclinically infected cases (Ferguson et al.\n2006). Plans for antiviral stockpile deploy-\nment are country specific because of the vari-\nations in demographics, infrastructure, and\navailable stockpiles. However, most plans are\nstructured around WHO preparedness plans\n(WHO 2006c).\nIn the event of a human outbreak, the cur-\nrent WHO strategy (WHO 2006c) recom-\nmends that all infected individuals (> 1 year of\nage) receive a 5-day course of 750 mg Tamiflu\n(i.e., 75 mg twice per day for 5 days). This\nquantity will also be needed for a 10-day pro-\nphylaxis course (i.e., 75 mg once per day for\n10 days), which could be extended for several\nweeks until there is no further risk of exposure\nto AIA. Given the large doses of Tamiflu, it is\nhighly significant that approximately 70% of\neach oral dose is excreted renally in the active\nantiviral form, OC, with up to 20% appearing\nin the feces (50% as OP and 50% as OC;\nTable 1) (He et al. 1999). Hence, up to 80%\nof an oral dose of OP can be excreted as OC.\nNo observed oxidative metabolites of OC have\nbeen reported in humans, indicating that OC is\nresistant to cytochrome P450 mixed-function\noxidases and glucuronosyltransferase (He et al.\n1999; Sweeny et al. 2000). OC has not been\nreported to undergo appreciable mineralization\nbased on a standard Organization for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development\n(OECD) biodegradability test [European\nMedicines Agency (EMEA) 2005].

The World Health Organization has strongly recom-\nmended the use of the antiviral drug Tamiflu both to treat and prevent pandemic influenza infec-\ntion. A major concern for the long-term efficacy of this strategy is to limit the development of\nTamiflu-resistant influenza strains. However, in the event of a pandemic, hundreds of millions of\ncourses of Tamiflu, stockpiled globally, will be rapidly deployed. Given its apparent resistance\nto biodegradation and hydrophilicity, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), the active antiviral and\nmetabolite of Tamiflu, is predicted to enter receiving riverwater from sewage treatment works in\nits active form.\nOBJECTIVE: Our objective in this study was to determine the likely concentrations of OC released\ninto U.S. and U.K. river catchments using hydrologic modeling and current assumptions about the\ncourse and management of an influenza pandemic. \nDISCUSSION: We predict that high concentrations of OC (micrograms per liter) capable of inhibit-\ning influenza virus replication would be sustained for periods of several weeks, presenting an\nincreased risk for the generation of antiviral resistance and genetic exchange between influenza\nviruses in wildfowl.

OC has both\namine and carboxylate groups in the molecule\nimparting hydrophilicity, a low partition coef-\nficient (log P of 1.1), and high water solubility\n(588 mg\/mL at 25\u00b0C) (American Hospital\nFormulary Service 2006). These physico-\nchemical features of OC will minimize loss by\nsorption to sewage sludge during wastewater\ntreatment. In the absence of empirical evidence\nto the contrary, Relenza (GlaxoSmithKline,\nBrentford, Middlesex, UK), a structurally\nsimilar NA inhibitor, was used as a model for\nestimating the ecotoxicologic and environ-\nmental fate of Tamiflu. Relenza is a) not\nlikely to sorb to soil or sediment if released\ndirectly into the environment; b) not likely to\npartition to fats; c) not readily volatile;\nd) readily soluble in water; e) chemically sta-\nble in water [thus, hydrolysis is unlikely to be\na significant depletion mechanism (half-life\n> 1 year); and f ) is not readily mineralized\n(aerobic; degradation < 1% in 28 days in acti-\nvated sludge) (GlaxoSmithKline 2004).\nTo assess the potential biodegradability of\nTamiflu and OC, we used a metabolic path-\nway prediction system that recognizes the\norganic functional groups found in a com-\npound and predicts transformations based on\nmetabolic rules (Hou et al. 2004). Only one\nbiotransformation for OC was generated by\nthe program, employing an amine oxidase.\nThe general structure of OC is not radically\nchanged by this biotransformation, thus the\nOC metabolite might retain NA inhibitor\nproperties. The only published account of the\nbiodegradability of Tamiflu is within the doc-\numentation submitted by Roche to the EMEA\n(2005) in which it refers to the OECD carbon\ndioxide evolution test (Modified Sturm test)\nthat investigates the mineralization of Tamiflu\nin an aerobic slurry enriched with sewage\nsludge. At the conclusion of the 28-day assay,\n< 20% of Tamiflu had been converted to car-\nbon dioxide, demonstrating its recalcitrance\nand likely persistence in sewage treatment\nplants (EMEA 2005). The apparent resistance\nof OC to further biotransformation in the\nhuman body (He et al. 1999) and the limited\nbiodegradation reported in carbon dioxide\nevolution tests (EMEA 2005), plus its struc-\ntural similarity to the environmentally persis-\ntent NA inhibitor Relenza, strongly suggests\nthat both Tamiflu and OC will persist in\nwastewater and river water.\nWe examined catchments in the United\nKingdom and the United States to generate\nexamples of possible OC water concentra-\ntions. Catchment boundaries and the human\npopulation within the United Kingdom for\n1991 were provided by the computerized digi-\ntal terrain network (Bracken and Martin\n1989). However, from 1991 to 2004, the\npopulation of England and Wales has grown\nby 6.8%; therefore, we estimated the 2004\npopulation by scaling up. We predicted the\nnatural flow from the catchment surface area,\ndischarge point, and geographic location, as\ndescribed by Young et al. (2003). We calcu-\nlated the annual mean flow and available dilu-\ntion per capita from the mean annual rainfall\nfor 1961\u20131991 and from assumptions on\nrunoff and evaporation for that location\n(Table 2) (Holmes et al. 2002). \nPotential risks of widespread Tamiflu use\nEnvironmental Health Perspectives \u2022 VOLUME 115 | NUMBER 1 | January 2007 103\nTable 1.

These catchments were\nselected to represent the variety present within\nthe United States (Figure 2A): They represent\n19% of the land area, contain 14% of the\nhuman population, and receive waste from\n1,112 sewage treatment plants (Anderson et al.\n2004). In general, these selected American\ncatchments are larger than those in the United\nKingdom, with lower population densities,\nand thus have more available dilution per\nhead of population. The Lower Colorado\nRiver is an exception, being in an arid area\nwith very low flow. Five catchments within\nthe United Kingdom have been selected for\nthe modeling exercise, particularly focusing\non low naturalized flow (Figure 2B). \nThe concentration of OC in river water\non a given day is provided by the following\nequation:\nWOC = (\u03a3C \u00d7 D \u00d7 0.8)\/\n(F \u00d7 1,000 \u00d7 P \u00d7 0.4104), [1]\nwhere WOC is the OC concentration (nano-\nmolar) in river water; \u03a3C is the sum of active\ncourses consumed by clinically infected people\nin a U.K. or U.S. catchment within the previ-\nous 5 days (reflecting the recommended treat-\nment course of Tamiflu); D is the daily dose of\nTamiflu (150,000 \u03bcg; 0.8 is the predicted max-\nimum fraction of an oral dose of Tamiflu that\nis converted to OC and released into the waste-\nwater); F is the available dilution per person\n(cubic meters per day per person); and P is the\npopulation in the catchment. For the United\nKingdom and the United States, we used the\nclinical case incidence per day suggested by\nFerguson et al. (2006), in which they modeled\na virus with a high or moderate basic reproduc-\ntive number (R0) of either 2 or 1.7. R0 is the\naverage number of secondary infections pro-\nduced by an infected individual in a fully sus-\nceptible population (Anderson and May\n1991). We divided the number of clinically\ninfected people per day by the respective total\npopulation to yield the fraction of the popula-\ntion infected on a daily basis. This fraction was\nused to estimate daily numbers of clinically\ninfected people for each catchment. In reality,\na range of concentrations would occur across\nthe different reaches of a catchment. However,\nthe mean concentrations from which natural-\nized flow is based indicate concentrations that\ncould be expected and also allow comparisons\nto be made across different catchments.\nMultiplying the naturalized flow by 1,000 con-\nverts the units to liters of river water; to convert\nunits from micrograms of OP per liter to\nnanomolar OC requires division by 0.410.\nIn brief, the model assumes that a) all\nclinical cases were treated at the first sign of\ninfection with a full course of Tamiflu lasting\n5 days, with 100% compliance; b) Tamiflu\nwas used only by clinically infected people, as\ndetermined by Ferguson et al. (2006); c) 80%\nof the ingested Tamiflu was released as OC;\nand d) all of the OC entering the catchment\nwas flushed out in 1 day (an underestimate for\nmost of these catchments). The decision to use\nonly clinically infected people in the model\nensures a conservative estimate of OC in river-\nwater because the model omits prophylactic\nuse and personal stockpiles; the latter was\nomitted because the extent of personal stock-\npiling and the quality of drug being stockpiled\nis unknown. Depending on how the pan-\ndemic might develop, prophylaxis might\nincrease projections by > 100%. \nFigure 3 shows broad estimates (based on\nthe average flow prediction) of the concentra-\ntion of OC in river water over the time course\nof an epidemic for viruses with moderate or\nhigh transmission (R0, 1.7 or 2.0). Table 2\nprovides estimates for the number of consecu-\ntive days that OC is projected to exceed 1 nM\nand 50 nM. As highlighted in Figure 3A, OC\nconcentrations in the Lee catchment (R0 = 2.0)\nexceed 95 nM for nearly 1 week. Similarly, we\npredict that the Lower Colorado catchment\n(Figure 3A) would have river water concentra-\ntions > 90 nM for 10 days, reaching a maxi-\nmum concentration of 112 nM (R0 = 2.0;\nFigure 3B). The Colorado catchment is pre-\ndicted to contain > 50 nM OC for 62 consecu-\ntive days, notably in the lower transmission\nlevel conditions (R0 = 1.7; Figure 3D).

Although not discussed\nin any detail here, the range of OC concentra-\ntions predicted in river water may have\nuncharacterized ecotoxicologic consequences.\nBased on the structure\u2013activity relationship\ndetermined using toxTree (version 1.00;\nIdeaconsult Ltd., Sofia, Bulgaria), both\nTamiflu and OC are predicted to be \u201cclass 3\u201d\ntoxicologic hazards. ToxTree employs the\nCramer decision tree approach, relying pri-\nmarily on chemical structures to estimate toxic\nhazard to establish priorities for more in-depth\ntoxicologic testing (Cramer et al. 1978). In an\nacute toxicity study in Daphnia magna, OP\nwas classified as harmful according to the\nEuropean Union Directive 67\/548\/EEC\n(EMEA 2005). The EMEA documentation\non the ecotoxicity of Tamiflu states, \nConsidering ecotoxicological properties, use pat-\ntern, dosage and maximal estimated amounts of\noseltamivir to be placed on the market, no expo-\nsure levels of concern to the environment are to be\nexpected. (EMEA 2005)\nHowever, it is unclear whether this ecotoxico-\nlogic risk assessment for OP was intended to\napply to pandemic avian influenza conditions.\nIn summary, we raise a number of, as yet,\nunconsidered risks to the environment from\nTamiflu use during a pandemic, most notably,\nthe ecotoxicologic hazard associated with the\nrelease of a uniquely structured, biochemically\nresistant antiviral drug. The recalcitrance of\nOC to metabolism in humans, sewage treat-\nment works, and river water will enable IC50\n(concentration that causes 50% inhibition)-\nrelevant concentrations to be reached in catch-\nments, potentially influencing the generation\nof Tamiflu-resistant AIA in wildfowl.\nThe avian species most commonly infected\nwith AI are wildfowl of the order Anseriformes\n(e.g., ducks, geese, swans) (Alexander 2000).\nThe AIA virus is believed to be transmitted\nbetween waterfowl by the fecal\u2013oral route as\nthey imbibe contaminated water, although in\na recent report with one AIA strain, Normile\n(2006) demonstrated that the virus was shed\nfar more heavily in the duck pharynx than\nthrough the feces. In birds, the virus replicates\nin the lower intestinal tract (small and large\nintestine) and in the lungs. In the gut it buds\nfrom the surface of mucosal cells into the\nlumen (Webster et al. 1978). In the event of\nwidescale Tamiflu use, waterfowl would\ningest large quantities of active OC together\nwith virus in their daily water intake, ranging\nfrom 64 mL\/kg\/day in glaucous-winged gulls\n(Walter and Hughes 1978) to 200\u2013300\nmL\/kg\/day in duck species (Hughes 2003).\nBecause of the poor bioavailability of OC rela-\ntive to its prodrug, Tamiflu (Kim et al. 1997;\nLi et al. 1998), a high percentage of OC\ningested by avian species will remain in the\nintestinal tract, the primary site of viral repli-\ncation in Anseriformes. Waterfowl have been\nshown to reabsorb urine into the rectum,\nileum, and\/or ceca, amounting to as much as\n40% of a mallard duck\u2019s daily water influx,\nthereby concentrating nontransported ions\nand molecules in the lumina (Hughes et al.\n1999). Hence, the concentration of OC in the\ngut of waterfowl might be higher than that\nfound in the riverwater. The published IC50 of\nthe NA enzyme for OC varies widely depend-\ning on the assay method and AIA isolate, rang-\ning from 0.01 to 114.0 nM OC (Ferraris et al.\n2005; Hurt et al. 2004; Mendel et al. 1998;\nRoche 2004). Le et al. (2005) reported the\nIC50 for drug-resistant H5N1 virus (A\/Hanoi\/\n30408\/2005) to be 90 nM. \nThe projected concentrations of OC in\nriver water (Table 2) could therefore drive the\nselection of resistant strains of AIA in the gut\nof waterfowl. Notably, it is relatively easy to\ngenerate Tamiflu-resistant mutants because\nsingle amino acid substitutions in NA have\nconferred high-level OC resistance (Colacino\net al. 1997; de Jong et al. 2005; Le et al. 2005;\nMcKimm-Breschkin et al. 2003; Mendel and\nSidwell 1998). Furthermore, the gradual rise\nof OC to IC50 and IC90-relevant concentra-\ntions during the course of an AIA epidemic, as\npredicted here, would be more effective in\ngenerating Tamiflu-resistant mutants than\nwould a sudden spike. A similar gradual\nincrease is used to select resistant mutants in\nlaboratory experiments.\nConclusions\nWe recognize that a highly pathogenic\nhuman-to-human transmissible AIA strain is\nunlikely to be frequently transmitted between\nhumans and waterfowl (Russell and Webster\n2005). However, the possibility of promoting\nnew OC resistant AIA strains in wildfowl\nintroduces another important factor to be\nconsidered in our international AIA strategy.\nThis is particularly important given the\nmobility of migrating wildfowl. Occasional\nco-infection in wildfowl could generate new\nstrains incorporating Tamiflu-resistant NA\ngenes. This scenario is most likely to occur in\nsoutheast Asian countries where humans and\nwaterfowl frequently come into close direct or\nindirect contact, and where significant\nTamiflu deployment is envisaged. We there-\nfore recommend similar, but more detailed,\nmodeling exercises in such countries to assess\nthe potential environmental and virologic risks\nthat we have highlighted. It will also be impor-\ntant to identify the locations that provide the\ngreatest intersection between human waste-\nwater effluent and waterfowl migration\nwithin relevant countries. More detailed stud-\nies need to be conducted to identify the\nextent of biotransformation that OC might\nundergo in different environments, in addi-\ntion to assessing the susceptibility of OC to\nphotodegradation. Attention should be given\nto developing methods to minimize the\nrelease of OC into the waste stream, such as\nbiological and chemical pretreatment in toi-\nlets, which could eliminate much of the\n\u201cdownstream\u201d risk. Regulatory guidance\nmight be needed to ensure proper disposal of\nthe Tamiflu stockpiles once they expire. \nREFERENCES\nAir GM, Laver WG. 1989.
