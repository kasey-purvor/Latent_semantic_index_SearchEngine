The aim of the joint project is to\nmaintain \u2014 even increase - the number of students enrolling on such first-year\ncourses without lowering the courses' existing mathematical standards.\nA CAL tutor for matrix theory is presented in this paper, in the form of Mathematica\nNotebooks. This constitutes one of a list of specific A-level mathematics core options\nrequired by science and engineering departments. The module has been written so\nas to recognize students' errors and advise accordingly. Questions are generated\nrandomly, at run time, in order to preclude copying between users. The module\nincorporates automated performance indicators so as to impinge minimally on\nexisting staff resources. As an aid to other CAL authors considering the use of\nMathematica Notebooks, idiosyncratic difficulties encountered within Mathematica\nNotebooks are catalogued and discussed in detail\nIntroduction\nThe problem\nStudents entering science and engineering courses are frequently faced with the problem of\nweakness in their mathematical preparation for further education; this is due to a number of\nfactors, not least of which is the vast number of possible combinations of A-level mathematics\nsyllabi. Many university science and engineering departments continue to offer courses\nrequiring a 'reasonable' level of mathematical comprehension, so that students deficient in\nspecific A-level mathematics topics are often inadequately prepared for such courses.\n27\nMA. Kelmanson etal A Mathematica-based CAL tutor for scientists\nThe problem, as described, affects a number of first-year courses at universities throughout\nGreat Britain; it has, in recent years, been further exacerbated by the introduction of the\nGCSE, since the subsequent jump to A-level mathematics is often considered to be too large.\nMoreover, many engineering departments accept students with a very wide range of entry\nqualifications besides A-levels, BTEC certificates and diplomas being the most notable\nexamples. Unfortunately, the mathematical content of such syllabi is much lower than that of\nA-level. The impending reorganization of the many A-level mathematics syllabi will lead to\nan inevitable dilution in many areas - especially calculus - and will further aggravate the\nsituation currently experienced by many university science and engineering departments.\nIn later academic years, deficiencies in mathematical grounding affect almost all the\ntheoretical courses taught in science and engineering departments, which are noticeably\nreluctant to defer their inherent course material in favour of the necessary extra mathematics\nmaterial. This recalcitrance towards course postponement is wholly understandable in the light\nof the inevitable knock-on effect which would both require an increase in the overall course\nduration, and affect the course validation with professional institutions. The worst possible\nscenario would be that a serious hiatus in degree standards between British and European\nuniversities might occur.\nIn the light of the above information, there is clearly a need to establish a convenient and\nflexible mechanism for teaching this transitional mathematics material in order to bring\nfirst-year students up to the required standard. (Transitional is used here in preference to\nremedial since the latter is definitively associated with slow-learning: in the context of this\npaper, this is clearly not the case.) Finally, any such mechanism should ideally impinge only\nminimally on existing staff resources.\nThe suggested remedy\nIn late 1992, Imperial College (IC) and Leeds University (LU) were jointly successful in\nprocuring a bid, under the TLTP Initiative of the UFC (now the HEFCE), which described a\nMathematica-based system for presenting mathematics tutorials to scientists and engineers.\nThe suggested remedy for the problems described above was the production of a suite of CAL\ninteractive tutorial modules based on Maihematica and its inherent front-end, Notebooks,\nwhich allows a certain degree of control over the navigation through the tutorial material.\nMaihematica (Wolfram, 1991) was suggested since, as a sophisticated and versatile integrated\npackage incorporating programming, numeric and symbolic computation, text processing and\ngraphics, it would allow flexible production of an extremely wide range of detailed\nmathematical material. Moreover, Maihematica has in recent years enjoyed a high profile in\nnumerous teaching projects; see, for example, Brown, 1991; Gray, 1991; Burbulla, 1992; The\nCalculus Reader, 1993.\nFurther to the above, Maihematica could be launched from a variety of platforms and\noperating systems, making it portable both within and between sites, primarily for\ndevelopment, ultimately for nation-wide distribution. Finally, through the interactive medium\nof Maihematica Notebooks, it was envisaged that a certain degree of genuine interaction\nbetween student and CAL module might be achieved, allowing students to use the same\nmodule on different levels solving different problems. More detailed discussions concerning\nMaihematica are deferred until later.\n28\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nSince the project began, on 1st November 1992, all necessary module development staff -\nthree at each site - have been appointed, and all required hardware and software is in situ. In\nthe (ongoing) initial phase of the project, IC are responsible for modules in complex numbers,\ntrigonometry and vectors, while LU are producing modules in differential calculus, integral\ncalculus and first-order differential equations; both sites are producing separate modules on\nmatrices, for comparison. It is LU's matrix module which will be presented and discussed,\nfrom both pedagogical and computational points of view, in subsequent sections of this paper.\nModule design\nInteraction philosophy\nA criticism which might be made of existing CAL modules is that much of their interaction is\n'hard wired' into them, so that after a few attempts at the same module, a student might\nperhaps achieve correct responses by memorizing problems that he\/she has already tackled,\nrather than by actually understanding the principles underlying the module's material. A\nnatural extension of this is to question wherein lies the difference between such a module and\na textbook. In the light of that question, the ensuing criticism would be that a textbook would,\nin fact, rank more useful than such a CAL module, since the former is truly portable.\nTherefore, an essential feature of our approach was to ensure that our modules were somehow\nmore 'human' in their interaction with the student: this constitutes a considerable challenge\nfrom both programming and pedagogical points of view. With regard to this aspect of a\nquasi-human helpful approach, the module should further be able not only to point out errors,\nbut also to recognize, trap, correct and advise accordingly in the light of student difficulties. If\nerrors are merely indicated as either right\/wrong, our experience dictates that user-frustration\nwill ensue, at which point the module ceases to be effective.\nInteraction implementation\nOne of the authors of this paper had already written a CAL Fortran 77 course given to\nfirst-year mathematics students at Bradford University. In that course, students were initially\nshielded from the predictably confusing side-issues of compilers and loading, since these are,\nin effect, system-dependent. By the same token, the LU team decided that module users\nshould be entirely shielded from the Mathematica 'maths engine' in the present project. We\nfelt that the students should certainly not be expected to assimilate the language of\nMathematica, since it might detract from their concentrating on the issue at hand, to wit: the\ntransitional mathematical material. This was not as easy to achieve as one might think, since\nthe only (partially suitable) interactive medium available to us (on which the initial project\nproposal was based) was Notebooks, Mathematica's inherent front end. Moreover, it was\nenvisaged that the modules were to be developed for a range of platforms, but since the\nmajority of UK universities and sixth-forms are more likely to be IBM-PC based, all further\ndiscussion will be thus directed. We are also developing Mathematica software for Unix\nmachines, but these presently do not support Notebooks.\nMathematica Notebooks\nFor the purposes of subsequent discussion, it is necessary briefly to outline the\nmodule-authoring medium, Mathematica Notebooks. This is a Windows-based menu-driven\nfront end through which the user may interact with the Mathematica kernel to produce\nmathematical and graphical output. Notebooks is presently limited to the PC, NeXT and\n29\nMA. Kelmanson et al A Mathematica-based CAL tutor for scientists\nMacintosh platforms, the last of which has been used extensively for Project CALC (The\nCalculus Reader, 1993), which has been used (in the USA) to teach first-year university\ncalculus in a laboratory environment\nMathematica Notebooks constitute an integrated environment in which the user can be\nprompted to perform calculations and\/or exercises. Information appears in Notebooks in cells,\nwhich are of differing types: input, output, text, graphics, etc. Hence, from a pedagogical\npoint of view, Notebooks enjoy the property that they are able to unite demonstrative text with\nsupporting graphics. Consecutive cells pertaining to a particular area or problem may be\ngrouped, in which case only the first cell in the group is subsequently visible, the rest being\nclosed; the closed cells may be opened again by double-clicking on designated group-boxes\nwhich appear on the screen. Similarly, groups of cells may themselves be grouped and closed;\nin this way, a potentially large document, although in the Notebooks in a linear form, may be\n'condensed' so that it can be viewed rather like the contents page of a book. The user may\nthen choose a particular topic title from within the Notebooks titles by double-clicking on its\ngroup-box, which will then open and display either subtitles or text. Hence it is easy to see\nthat notes, in the form of text, constitute the most-nested level of information, with section\nbanners residing at the outermost level of cell nesting. Figures 1, 2 and 3 illustrate some of\nthe points raised so far.\nMathematics for Windows - |Ma(J\n'M Eile Edit \u00a3ell Graph fiction Style Options iVindow Help is.\nI Input\nm INTERACTIVE CBL MODULE \u2014 MATRICES\nn Mark Kelmanson Simon Maunder and Sui Cheng,\nHEFCE Tl.TP Mathematica Project.

Kelmanson et al A Mathematica-based CAL tutor for scientists\nDifficulties within Notebooks\nIn producing the Matrix module, we encountered the occasional difficulty within the\nNotebooks environment. For example, once opened, groups remain thus even though the\nmaterial contained therein may no longer be required. Thus the Notebooks become more linear\nin appearance as progress is made through the module unless the user explicitly closes the\n'finished' cells. Similarly, when the user is interacting with Mathematica via its dialogue box,\nthe autoscroll in the Notebooks main window is disabled, thus forcing users explicitly to\nsearch for the responses to their input In version 2.2 of Mathematica, there is no control over\neither the size or location of the dialogue box; this, coupled with the aforementioned loss of\nautoscroll, constitutes a non-trivial problem in terms of ease of navigation by uninitiated\nusers. Finally, the absence of mathematical text and the inability to change fonts within a cell\nproved somewhat restrictive; much effort is required to circumvent this rather artificial\nrestraint.\nMathematica's absence of hotwords or 'intuition-driven' buttons etc. enforce a certain degree\nof linearity on the style of the module. We hope that future versions of Mathematica will\naccommodate the necessary features to support a more tree-structured module design: if they\ndo not, then Toolbook may yet be employed - upon arrival of MathLink - to front-end the\ninteraction, which is a further reason supporting the shielding of students from Mathematical\nprogramming language.\nIt is important to remark that the LU team has enjoyed an excellent rapport with Wolfram\nResearch and their in-house Technical Support Group who, in the light of our findings, were\nquick to remedy anomalies in the 2.2 p* version of Mathematica. We are confident that our\naforementioned comments will also be considered seriously, and that, through interaction with\nCAL groups such as ours, Wolfram Research will undertake relevant developments in future\nversions of Mathematica.\nThe Matrix Module\nContent\nIn order to facilitate navigation through the module, it was 'naturally' split into two sections\n(see Figure 2): Basic Properties of Matrices, for complete beginners, and Matrix Algebra and\nTransformations for users possessing a basic knowledge of principles and notation. Each such\nsection was further subdivided into more detailed sections (see Figure 3). Note that the\n(horizontal) size of any group-box in Figures 1 to 9 is indicative of the amount of material\ncontained within that group. Each general title contained a combination of tutorial notes,\nsupplementary exercises and, where relevant, animated graphics. For illustrative purposes, we\nshall concentrate further on the section entitled Transformations in the Plane; a typical section\nof text is depicted in Figure 4.\nInteraction and questions\nIn the absence of hotwords and buttons in the Notebooks environment, interaction had to be\n'invited', as shown in Figure 4. This is far from ideal, as it essentially means that users must\nbe aware of how to make Mathematica recognize their input; while such information can be\nplaced in a supposedly prominent location on the screen, there is no guarantee that the user\nwill assimilate it. We would prefer to see a more intuition-based front-end for this purpose.\n32\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nMathematics lor Windows -jMaf]\nFile Edit Cell Graph Action Style Options Window Help\n\\MM\\MSMml\n[ e ] \u2014 > [ c ]\n[ 1 ] [ \u00ab ]\n[ -I ] \" > [ a J\n[ \u00ab ] [ D ]\nthen\nT - [ a c ]\n[ b d ] .\noTtie idgntity transformation\no Rotation\nfor an anticlockwise rotation of angle A about the origin.\nT - [ cos fi -s in fl ]\n[ sin A cos 0 ]\n\u2022 Animation 1\n[V; S O T J L E C U C K th*mci3\u00ab oaths r.fstlitdei.heflw) bair tots* bottats ngbtef\nCii) click Ui* mcrj!\u00ab or; U>\u00ab fitl* ' f J n * syitibol wSuch is the ssvette icon from\nTo stop ik? <\u00a3i\u00a3U4UorL cii;fc 3n*p.<rfi*r$ m '&* fifuawuon 4re4.\nRotation ot 60 dttjeees about (0,01\nFigure 4: Textual content and 'invitation' into interaction\nMathematics for Windows - |Mat]\n\u00abg Pie Edit Cell Eraph fiction Style Options fflindow Help\nTitle\n\u00bb Exercise 4\nNow activate the following exercises on matrix transformations.\nQuecfMat2D (* fill here, then piess SHIFT * RETURN \u00bb\nn Combinntion of transformations\nWe saw above that a point (x,y) could be tr '\nJr i\nKernel Input\nLet die transformation matrix which does this\nmay itself be transformed into a new point (x\nsecond transformation be called Q (which, \\\nfrom F ).

Kelmanson et at A Mathematica-based CAL tutor for scientists\nOn initiating a question, a dialogue box appears as in Figure 5. Unfortunately, the tutor's\ndialogue is restricted to only two or three lines of text; couple this with the absence of\nmathematical fonts and the wish to shield users from Mathematica's language, and it soon\nbecomes apparent that a great deal of programming effort is required to obtain seemingly\nstraightforward information.\nAs a means of discouraging the memorizing of previously-attempted examples, random\nnumbers are used in all the interactive exercises. Students are encouraged to perform\ncalculations using pen and paper and, in the later sections of the module, open-ended\nexamples are proffered (just as they might be by a lecturer!).\nIn producing this (and other) modules, we sought to achieve an approach whereby the user\nwas not merely told that their responses were 'right' or 'wrong'. In the former case, this is not\ntoo much of a problem, but in the latter, somewhat more is required if the CAL user is to gain\na true understanding of the principles involved. In this respect, Mathematica's inherent\nhigh-level functions proved invaluable in assisting us to locate various types of user-errors.\nError trapping\nWhen prompting users for input, error-trapping code had to be written in order to circumvent\nthe restrictions imposed by the pedagogically artificial Mathematica format. We stress that\nthis effort is very much justified since it is common knowledge that once an 'automated'\npackage fails to perform correctly, user-disenchantment and frustration quickly follow.\nIn order to allow the users to enter solutions in an intuitive manner - i.e. not tied to\nMathematica input-format - considerable effort was expended in ensuring that the packages\ncould recognize a large array of possible input formats. For example, our module accepts any\nof the following possible inputs for \u00ab\u00ab(-40): sin[40], sin(40), sin -40, sin-40, -sin40, - sin 40,\nSin[40], Sin(40), Sin -40, - Sin 40, Sin-40, -Sin40. To interpret all of these (perfectly\nfeasible) inputs as one and the same quantity, some sophisticated aspects of Mathematica's\nprogramming language were employed. For the reasons described above, we do not consider\nthat if an expression is mathematically correct but syntactically wrong with respect to\nMathematica, users should be penalized (and therefore disenchanted) for their input style.\nFortunately, Mathematica supports an extremely powerful programming language which\nfacilitates the implementation of interactive questions that are robust, syntactically flexible and\ncorrective in nature. In the experience of the authors of this paper, Mathematica's inherent\nlanguage is more flexible than that of similar packages (see, for example, Char, 1991).\nIn general, the user is provided with two chances to enter the correct response, which is then\nparsed using a custom-written Mathematica package, to determine whether or not it is\nessentially correct. Minor errors are highlighted but not penalized. If possible, the specific\nnature of more serious errors is identified, and appropriate corrective action is then suggested;\notherwise, more general information on the required approach is supplied. As an example,\nFigure 6 shows such a message in response to an incorrect user input.\nThis parsing and subsequent interpretation of user input is, in our view, a crucial element in\nthe philosophy of CAL. Many CAL users - including the authors of this paper - are\nfrequently impressed by (static or animated) examples involving sophisticated three-\ndimensional multi-coloured graphics (see, for example, Maeder, 1991)); to most users, these\nare the flagship of algebraic manipulators.

We believe that our\napproach goes some way towards achieving these aspects.\nAnimated graphics\nAn important feature of the Notebooks is the ability to incorporate animated graphics within\nthe same environment as mathematical output and tutorial notes; it is this feature of\nMathematica Notebooks which proved so attractive for the purposes of the present project. In\nNotebooks, an animation is obtained by grouping together a sequence of cells each of which\ncontains a PostScript image produced by Mathematica graphics functions. If the group of cells\nis then closed in the manner described above in the section headed Mathematica Notebooks,\nonly the first image in the sequence remains visible. An animation icon may then be used to\ninitiate the animation of the cells so grouped. As an example, Figures 7 and 8 show\nanimations illustrating the application of rotation matrix to a prescribed polygon: in this paper,\nthe two images are necessarily shown 'in series' whereas in the module, the polygon flips\ncyclically from one position to the other with the axes remaining fixed.\nThe matrix module contains a substantial number of animations illustrating various types of\ntransformation. Geometric interpretations, such as the general non-commutativity of matrix\nmultiplication, are ideally illustrated via this medium. From an interactive point of view, the\nuser may provide the parameters for a given transformation, thus permitting a degree of\ninvestigative experimentation; on this note, Notebooks may still be used to initiate open-ended\ninvestigations, as they constitute a powerful tool for the required analysis.\n35\nMA.

In order to ensure that student progress could be\nmonitored, an automatic performance-recording procedure was implemented. Results of the\nuser's attempts at the (or, indeed, any) module are automatically written to a file to which\nthere is only staff access. For each user, only a single entry is maintained: this is updated in a\ncumulative sense insofar as it monitors attempts at a particular question from a number of\ndifferent sessions. The user-record indicates both the percentage ratings on a given question\nand the number of attempts at a given question (this is to distinguish those users who, for\nexample, score 1\/1, from those who score 19\/20).\nIn order to implement this automated logging of performance, an alphabetically-sorted list of\nentries is maintained. Any interactive question ends with an update of the appropriate entry.\nThe update for a question may take one of two forms: amendment of existing information for\nthat particular question, or insertion of performance information for that question into the\nrelevant part of the user's entry (if that part has not previously been created). It should be\nnoted that each entry is an alphabetically sorted list comprised of sub-entries for each\nattempted question. Since there exists only a single line in the file for each user, and\nfurthermore that line consists of information for the attempted questions, the file is\nparticularly concise. This file is encrypted and its contents accessed by only the (human)\ncourse tutor, using a custom-written, simple-to-use Mathe\/natica package which (see Figure 9)\ndisplays graphically the required information.\nMaUiematica (or Windows \u2022 INewnt>-11\n\u2022a) File Edit Cell Graph Action Style Options Window Help\nHodule 1 : no. of attempts against correct entries\nDall Degas Honet Picasso Renoir\nf- , '\u2022?;\nr\nFigure 9: Tutor-viewable performance graphics\n37\nMA. Kelmanson etal A Mathematica-based CAL tutor for scientists\nEvaluation\nThis paper would be incomplete without some indication of the performance of the module 'in\nthe field'. At the end of May 1993, the module described above was tested by a group of\nsixth-formers from the Further Maths group at Harrogate Grammar School. None of the\ntesters had used Mathematica previously, and about half were familiar with Windows. Nearly\nall had used some form of PC before.\nFeedback on the module was extremely encouraging: 90-100% (of the testers) were positive\nabout the content and presentation; 60-70% liked the style and mode of feedback; 60% found\nNotebooks clear and navigable. On this last point, the navigability is a factor which, in\nessence, lies in the hands of Wolfram Research. Overall, 20% of the users still preferred a\ntext-book approach to that of CAL\nMany of the criticisms raised related to the inherent properties of the Mathematica front-end\n(briefly discussed above in the section headed Difficulties within Notebooks): position of\ndialogue box, loss of autoscrolling during interaction, absence of standard 'mathematical'\nnotation, etc. These had already been predicted as they had essentially been the subject of\ncorrespondence between Wolfram Research and the authors of this paper. It is hoped that\nfuture versions of Mathematica will accommodate features which will alleviate or eradicate\nthese particular problems.\nFuture developments\nFurther modules\nThe module described in this paper has essentially constituted a pilot investigation, the results\nof which can now be implemented in the other modules which will complete the first\ninter-site suite. As mentioned in our introduction, these are: vectors, trigonometry, complex\nnumbers, differential calculus, integral calculus and first-order differential equations. In the\nlight of current exterior interest in the joint project, both sites are at present clarifying\ncopyright arrangements with a view to distributing freely the modules so far produced (any\ninterested parties may contact any of the authors of this paper).\nAlternative front ends\nAn essential difficulty of the Notebooks style is the inherent 'linearity'. Navigation through\nNotebooks is possible via user-search rather than by 'hotwords' or buttons; in our view, this is\nsomewhat limiting. A separate, button-driven front-end, such as Toolbook, would seem more\nsuitable for driving the Mathematica maths engine, but Toolbook also suffers from limitations\nin mathematical text presentation. One can circumvent this problem using equation editors and\ngraphics packages, but that is far from ideal. In any case, not until MathLink becomes\navailable from Wolfram Research can Mathematical kernel be easily linked to an alternative\nfront end.\n38\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors of this paper wish to express their gratitude to the following people involved in\nthe project: Professors M.I.G, Bloor and J.
