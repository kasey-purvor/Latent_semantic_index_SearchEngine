Introduction\nRecent advances in jet noise reduction have considerably increased the importance of noise from the\nengine fan and the airframe as a significant contribution to the overall noise, especially during landing. Civil\nairframes often feature recesses or grooves to accommodate service hatches and other ancillary equipment.\nThe flow in these cavity-shaped recesses is unsteady and, at typical landing speeds, may features large-scale\ninstabilities. The most acoustically active airframe components in a civil aircraft are the high lift systems\nand the landing gear. Nonetheless, other components, such as fuel vents or ailerons, also contribute to the\noverall noise emissions. A cylindrical open cavity placed one metre downstream of the wing leading edge\nis herein investigated as an initial low fidelity fuel vent model of a widebody civil aircraft. The fuel vent\nlocation and design can vary among aircraft. Fuel vents are often cut in the underside wing skin or are\nlocated on the wing trailing edge. They avoid any vacuum in the fuel tank that could stop the fuel flow\nor cause the tank to implode, by letting the air in to balance the tank internal pressure. Although the\namplitude of fuel vent noise is relatively low compared to other airframe noise sources, it happens to cover\na higher frequency range, therefore it is perceived by a ground observer as louder with respect to what its\namplitude in decibel would suggest, due to the dB(A) weighting.1\nRecent advances in code parallelization and in multi-processor computational platforms allow nowa-\ndays the modelling of representative industrial geometries by conventional Computational Fluid Dynamics\n(CFD).2 Different challenges are nonetheless posed by computational aeroacoustics. A larger computational\ndomain with respect to conventional CFD is required to resolve a full wavelength of the radiated noise. A\nmore accurate, less dissipative and efficient non-reflective boundary condition needs to be applied to cor-\nrectly evaluate the amplitude of the pressure fluctuations in the near-field acoustic domain. High-order low\ndissipation and dispersion schemes have lowered the cost of aeroacoustic models to a more affordable level.\nDirect numerical simulation (DNS) of the radiating noise is limited to low Reynolds number and high\nMach number models. To resolve all the relevant scales of motion in the flow and to cover at least one\nwavelength of the radiated sound in the computational domain, the total number of necessary operations is\nof the order of the Reynolds number to the third power over the Mach number to the fourth power, for a fully\nthree dimensional simulation.3 DNS is more suitable for simpler aeroacoustic models, specifically to validate\nan aeroacoustic method that includes a turbulence closure model. Past cavity aeroacoustic investigations\nmainly focussed on rectangular enclosures, due to the savings in computer time that can be achieved by\nthe use of a Cartesian mesh. The computational resources now available enable the use of a curvilinear\nconformal mesh to tackle also a cylindrical cavity.4,5\nTo obtain a preliminary understanding of the main instability mechanism and of the overall flow pattern\nthat characterizes the cavity flow, an inviscid simulation is herein used. This simulation is expected to\ncapture the main cavity flow instability mechanism. However, this method omits to account for the inflow\nturbulent boundary layer. From the available literature,6 it is known that the momentum thickness (\u03b8) at\nthe leading edge of the cavity plays an important role in the selection of the modes and in governing the\n2 of 12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\ngrowth of the shear layer6,7, 8 spanning an open cavity.9 At the selected flow regime, the interaction of the\nshear layer with the downstream cavity edge produces pressure waves that excite the leading edge shear\nlayer, providing the feedback for self-sustained oscillations. The evolution of such unsteady pressure field\nand its interaction with the leading edge shear layer can be obtained by modelling the inflow boundary\nlayer as a vortex sheet, neglecting the inflow momentum thickness.10 Therefore the Euler model herein\nconsidered can approximately capture this feedback, responsible for the tonal component of the cavity noise.\nThough the spectrum of cavity noise typically contains broadband and tonal components, and the broadband\ncomponents are introduced by the turbulence in the shear-layer spanning the cavity opening, cavity tones\noften dominate the far-field noise spectrum. The frequencies of such tones can be approximately reproduced\nby an Euler method.\nII. Test-case geometry and inflow condition\nTwo cylindrical cavities of diameter (L) of 100 mm and depths (D) of 140 mm and 70 mm are herein\nstudied as low fidelity fuel vent models. The characteristic length and width are equal to the diameter, which\nleads to a flow with important spanwise structures.11 Upstream of the cavity, the inflow is uniform. Two\ndifferent free-stream velocities are considered in this study u\u221e = 102 m\/s and u\u221e = 80 m\/s at International\nStandard Atmospheric ground conditions. At these conditions, the resulting non-dimensional parameter that\ncharacterizes the numerical predictions are: L\/D = 0.714, L\/D = 2.5, M\u221e = 0.235, and M\u221e = 0.3.\nIII. Numerical method\nIII.A. Governing equations\nThe conservative time-dependent Euler equations are:\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nU+\u2207 \u00b7 F = 0 (1)\nTaking the time derivative of the conservation of mass and the divergence of the conservation of momen-\ntum, Lighthill12 rearranged equation (1) into an inhomogeneous wave equation where the sources of noise\nare on the right hand side:\n2\n2\nyp\n\u2032 (y, t) = \u2207y \u00b7 \u2207y \u00b7\n\u0001\n(2)\nIII.B. Discretization and integration methods\nTo compute the conservative variables U in the computational domain, an in-house solver is used. The\nflow solver is a finite volume approximate Riemann solver with a Monotone Upstream-centered Scheme for\nConservation Laws (MUSCL) interpolation.13 The latter, by Van Leer et al.,14 gives up to a third order\naccurate reconstruction of the spatial gradient in region of smooth flow. To prevent numerical oscillations\nin region of rapidly changing flow, the spatial gradients are limited by the introduction of a Total Variation\nDiminishing Scheme (TDV) by Sweby.15 The scheme is explicit and a standard multi-stage Runge-Kutta\n(RK) integration is used to time-march the flow. A second order two step RK is used in the simulation.\nIII.C. Boundary conditions\nThe computational domain is fully rinded using ghost cells, generated in the code by mirroring the first\ninterior cell about the boundary plane. Boundary flow states are imposed in the ghost cell. In the Euler\nsimulation, an inviscid wall condition, or slip condition, is imposed in the physical wall boundaries and a\nsubsonic non-reflective far-field boundary condition in the domain outer boundaries. The latter is a switching\ncondition between a subsonic inflow condition and a subsonic outflow condition, depending on the value of\nthe inner flow normal velocity component with respect to the surface boundary, according to CFD General\nNotation System standard.16\nThe inviscid wall condition corresponds to u \u00b7 n = 0 at the boundary S between the most interior cell\nand the ghost cell, where n is the inward normal to S. This is numerically achieved by imposing:\nub = uphy \u2212 2uphy \u00b7 n (3)\n3 of 12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nTo obtain a non-reflective boundary condition, a 3D extension17 of the characteristic based boundary\nconditions of Giles18 is used. To limit the non-physical reflection caused by the numerical scheme, the\nfollowing procedure is followed, depending on whether the flow is entering or exiting the computational\ndomain boundary. In the far-field, outside the computational domain, the following conditions are known:\nu\u221e, p\u221e and T\u221e. Based on these value, c\u221e, s\u221e, T0, p0 and \u03c10 are evaluated. Using Ub is possible to define\ncb and sb. An average speed of sound c = (c\u221e + cb) \/2 is then derived. Based on average speed of sound,\n\u03c1, u and p are computed using sb and ub if the flow is entering the domain, and s\u221e and u\u221e if the flow is\nexiting the domain.\nIII.D. Acoustic sources\nEquation (2) describes the problem of the non-linear propagation of the acoustic waves in the flow reference\nsystem. For many applications, an absolute reference system is more suitable for studying the radiated\nnoise from the moving sources. Following the work of Curle,19 Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings20 derived\nequation (1) in an absolute reference system including the effect of surfaces in arbitrary motion. In the\nabsolute reference system, the conservation of mass can be written as:21\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c1+\u2207x \u00b7 \u03c1u = (\u03c1\u221eu \u00b7 n) \u03b4 (f) + (\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1\u221e) (u \u00b7 n\u2212 v \u00b7 n) \u03b4 (f) (4)\nThe conservation of momentum can be written as:21\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\u03c1u) +\u2207x \u00b7 (p\n\u0000\n+ \u03c1u\u2297 u) = [(p\u2212 p\u221e)\n\u0000\n\u00b7 n] \u03b4 (f) + [(\u03c1u) (u \u00b7 n\u2212 v \u00b7 n)] \u03b4 (f) (5)\nFollowing the same procedure in section III.A, the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings acoustic analogy\n(FW-H) is obtained subtracting the divergence of equation (5) from the time derivative of equation (4):21,22\n2\n2\nxp\n\u2032 (x, t) = \u2207x \u00b7 \u2207x \u00b7 [\n\u0001\nH (f)]\n\u2212\u2207x \u00b7 {[p\n\u0000\n\u00b7 n+ \u03c1u (u \u00b7 n\u2212 v \u00b7 n)] \u03b4 (f)}+\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n{[\u03c1\u221ev \u00b7 n+ \u03c1 (u \u00b7 n\u2212 v \u00b7 n)] \u03b4 (f)} (6)\nIt is of interest to notice that no assumption has been made in equation (6) on the integration surface\nf = 0 that can be porous. Equation (6) can be integrated in retarded time using the Green function\nmethod. Farassat23 introduced the following relation to use the time resolved CFD data as input to the\nintegral formulation of FW-H:\n\u2202\n\u2202xi\n[\n\u03b4 (f)\nr\n]\nret\n= \u2212\n1\nc\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n[\nri\u03b4 (f)\nr2\n]\nret\n\u2212\nri\u03b4 (f)\nr3\n(7)\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n[Q (y, \u03c4)]ret =\n[\n1\n1\u2212Mr\n\u2202Q\n\u2202\u03c4\n]\nret\n(8)\nIn equation (8), Q (y, \u03c4) is a generic function in the source reference system y andMr = u\u00b7r\u02c6\/c is the Mach\nnumber in the observer direction.

Numerical model\nIV.A. Computational mesh\nTo model the cylindrical cavity of section II, a conformal curvilinear mesh is used. By multi-zone decom-\nposition, the flow domain has been divided into six zones, as shown in figure 1. Each zone has a similar\nnumber of cells to even out the computational load among the processors.\nY X\nZ\n4\n5\n6\n3\n1\n(a) Computational mesh\nY X\nZ4\n5\n6\n3\n2\n1\n(b) Detail of the mesh in the enclosure\nFigure 1. Computational domain details\nThe domain outside the cavity is 18.4 L x 18.4 L x 9.6 L. A large domain of the order of 20 L is used\nto resolve at least one full acoustic wavelength of the radiating sound. The selected computational domain\nvolume is the smallest that prevents the non-linear interaction of the acoustic radiation in the computational\ndomain with the potential flow at the outer domain boundaries.6 0.34 million cells are used in the L\/D = 0.71\ncavity model and 0.327 million cells in the L\/D = 2.5 model.\nFigure 2 shows the mesh skewness24 over the cavity opening. The skewness has the maximum value\nof 0.42. As the skewness is an index of the local mesh deformation, it is best minimized throughout the\ndomain. An advantage of the generated computational mesh is the modest deformation of the cells around\nthe perimeter of the cylinder.\nIV.B. Boundary conditions and starting flow condition\nThe following boundary conditions are used in the model: the physical walls are modelled as an inviscid wall,\nthe outer domain boundaries are far-field and the inter-block boundaries are connectivity. An inter-block\nboundary cell is defined as the ghost cell corresponding to physical cells of a neighbouring zone. For a\ngeneral connectivity between zone 1 and zone 2, the state in the inter-block boundary ghost cells is defined\nas Ub1 = Uphy2. The face x = 9.2 L of zone 3 is defined as an outflow condition and the face x = \u22129.2 L of\nzone 5 is defined as an inflow condition. The inflow and outflow conditions are obtained from the far-field\ncondition in section III.C by fixing the flow direction. In the far-field, two flow states (u\u221e, p\u221e, T\u221e) are used\nfor M\u221e = 0.235 and M\u221e = 0.3. These are (102.1, 0, 0)\nT m\/s, 101325 Pa, 298.15 K and (80, 0, 0)T m\/s,\n101325 Pa and 298.15 K. At the inflow, u = u\u221e and \u03c1 = \u03c1\u221e = 1.225 kg\/m\n3 and at the outflow the back\npressure p = p\u221e.\nAt the beginning of the simulation, the inflow is imposed over the full computational domain.

The interaction between the fluctuating vortex sheet predicted by the\nEuler model and the cavity trailing edge produces pressure waves.25 The frequency that characterizes these\npressure waves phase-locks the vortex sheet fluctuation, producing a self-sustained instability. The numerical\npredictions suggest that the recirculation pattern inside the enclosure is independent from the free-stream\nvelocity but it is probably related to the cavity geometry. The L\/D = 2.5 cavity flow is found to have a\ndominant instability mode at St = 0.833 at M\u221e = 0.235 and at St = 1.448 at M\u221e = 0.3. The maximum\nreversed velocity inside the enclosure is approximately u = \u221224 m\/s at M\u221e = 0.235 and u = \u221240 m\/s at\nM\u221e = 0.3. The near-field pressure fluctuation peak directivity is 135\n\u25e6 from the u\u221e direction.\n(a) Streamline and pressure iso-contour in the enclo-\nsure, L\/D = 2.5 and M\u221e = 0.235\n(b) Streamline and pressure iso-contour in the enclo-\nsure, L\/D = 2.5 and M\u221e = 0.3\nFigure 3. Symmetric recirculation from a L\/D = 2.5 shallow cavity\nV.A.2. Deep cavity\nThe L\/D = 0.71 deep cavity configuration is characterized by an asymmetric recirculation in the enclosure,\nas shown in figure 4. A similar asymmetric recirculation in a L\/D = 2 cylindrical cavity was observed\nexperimentally by Dybenko et al.5,26 The simulation suggests that the greater cavity depth may be the\ncause of the asymmetric recirculation and of the asymmetric pressure iso-contours in the cavity open end.\nThe L\/D = 0.71 cavity flow is found to have a dominant instability mode at St = 0.5295 at M\u221e = 0.235\nand at St = 0.491 at M\u221e = 0.3. The maximum reversed velocity inside the enclosure is approximately\nu = \u221250 m\/s at M\u221e = 0.235 and u = \u221263 m\/s at M\u221e = 0.3.\nV.B. Near-field Sound Pressure Level\nV.B.1. Shallow cavity\nThe near-field SPL from a shallow cavity configuration is characterized by a low amplitude pressure fluctu-\nation as shown in figure 5. SPL = 87 dB is predicted at y = (0, 0, 8L) at M\u221e = 0.3 and SPL = 86 dB\nis predicted at y = (0, 0, 8L) at M\u221e = 0.235. Comparing figure 5(a) and figure 5(b), the near-field SPL\niso-contours have a different shape, possibly due to the different Doppler effect that changes the orientation\nof the radiation peak directivity at M\u221e = 0.235 with respect to M\u221e = 0.3.\n7 of 12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nFigure 4.

The higher pressure peak, characterizing this\ninstability, could be related to the more localized interaction between the vortex sheet and the the cavity\ntrailing edge side.\nV.C. Noise sources from the computational domain\nV.C.1. Shallow cavity\nTo identify the noise sources and to locate the integration surface of the FW-H acoustic analogy, the double\ndivergence of the Lighthill stress tensor (\u2207y \u00b7 \u2207y \u00b7 T ) has been evaluated from the aerodynamic flow predic-\ntions. To differentiate Tij , the altering equation toolbox from Tecplot 360 was used. The spatial derivative is\nonly first order accurate and it does not perform well in the inter-block boundary cells, as shown in figure 7.\nIn the shallow cavity configuration, it is found that \u2207y \u00b7 \u2207y \u00b7 T iso-contours, at z = 4L plane above the\ncavity open end, coincide with those from pressure. The numerical result suggests that above this plane, the\nnon-linear interaction related to the quadrupole term distribution can be neglected and the residual source\nfield above this plane simply accounts for the Doppler effect of the free-stream. The appropriateness of\nthe integration surface location can be checked by comparing the far field noise predictions from the FW-H\nintegral to the ones obtained from an integration surface moved further away from the enclosure.\nV.C.2. Deep cavity\nIn the deep cavity configuration, where the instability is characterized by a lower St as described in V.A.2,\na good agreement between the p iso-contours and the (\u2207y \u00b7 \u2207y \u00b7 T ) iso-contours, shown in figure 8, has been\nfound at z = 8L plane above the cavity open end. The large computational domain still allows different\nintegration surfaces to be considered in the future work to compute the fuel vent contribution to the far-field\nnoise.\n9 of 12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nXY\nZ\n0\n-700\n-500\n-200\n200\n700\n700\n500\n500\n0\n-200\n-200\n0\nFigure 7. \u2207y \u00b7 \u2207y \u00b7 T N\/m\n4. z = 4L L\/D = 2.5 and M\u221e = 0.235 [m\/s]\nX\nY\nZ\n1800 Pa \/ m^2\n-2400 Pa \/ m^2\n0 Pa \/ m^2\n-2400 Pa \/ m^2\n-2400 Pa \/ m^2\n-2400 Pa \/ m^2\n-1800 Pa \/ m^21800 Pa \/ m^2\n-1800 Pa \/ m^2\n2400 Pa \/ m^2\n900 Pa \/ m^2\n900 Pa \/ m^2\n900 Pa \/ m^2\n900 Pa \/ m^2\n-900 Pa \/ m^2\n1800 Pa \/ m^2\n-900 Pa \/ m^2\nFigure 8. \u2207y \u00b7 \u2207y \u00b7 T N\/m\n4. z = 8L L\/D = 0.71 and M\u221e = 0.235\n10 of 12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nVI. Conclusion\nAn Euler numerical model of a cylindrical cavity flow has been studied by an in-house CFD code. A\nL\/D = 2.5 shallow cavity has been modelled at two different free-stream condition M\u221e = 0.235 and\nM\u221e = 0.3. At the same free-stream conditions, a L\/D = 0.71 deep cavity was also modelled. The cavities are\nbehaving as a closed cavity11 at the selected flow regimes and the geometries. The deep cavity configuration\nis characterized by an azimuthal instability, and by a recirculation at 45\u25e6 with respect to the streamwise\ndirection. Mass ejection and injection occur only on one side of the cavity in this instability. The shallow\ncavity is characterized by a symmetric recirculation and by a lower amplitude pressure fluctuation. Although\nthe pressure amplitude is lower in the shallow cavity, it happens to be at a higher frequency range. The SPL\nnear-field has been estimated by averaging 25 frames over a period of oscillation. The numerical prediction\ngives an appreciation of the radiating noise characteristic directivity in the acoustic near-field. The double\ndivergence of the Lighthill stress tensor has been valuated in the computational domain. The first order\naccurate results can be used to obtain a fist estimate for the location of the integration surface to perform\na FW-H acoustic analogy.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research project has been supported by a Marie Curie Early Stage Research Training Fellowship of\nthe European Community\u2019s Sixth Framework Programme under contract number MEST CT 2005 020301.\nReferences\n1Cambiano, M., Grottadaurea, M., and Rona, A., \u201cTowards quieter airframes,\u201d Aeronautics Days, Vienna, Austria, July\n2006.\n2Long, L., Morris, P., and Agarwal, A., \u201cA Review of Parallel Computing in Computational Aeroacoustics,\u201d Int.
