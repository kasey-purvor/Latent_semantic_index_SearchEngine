Although polysac-\ncharide conjugate vaccines have been developed and used\nsuccessfully against many of the serogroups of N. meningitidis, such\na strategy has proved ineffective against group B meningococci.\nThis serogroup now represents the majority of cases in the UK [1].\nVaccines containing Outer Membrane Vesicle preparations\n(OMVs) have been used to successfully to vaccinate against\nspecific outbreak strains of group B N. meningitidis [2,3,4], but such\npreparations do not give sufficient cross protection to justify their\nuse as universal meningococcal vaccines. Although protein\nantigens that are protective against serogroup B meningococci\nhave been identified by reverse vaccinology [5] there remains a\nneed to characterise the immune response to neisserial infection\nand to identify further vaccine candidates for use in a cross\nprotective vaccine.\nClassic studies performed in the 1960\u2019s demonstrated the\nimportance of bactericidal antibody for protection against\nmeningococcal disease, as reviewed by Pollard and Frasch [6].\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that important and pan-reactive\ndeterminants of immunity remain to be discovered. (i) In\nimmunocompetent individuals a single episode of meningococ-\ncaemia confers permanent immunity to all types of meningococci\n[6,7,8]. (ii) Carriage of commensal species such as Neisseria lactamica\nprovides immunity to meningococcal disease [6,7,8]. (iii) Inocu-\nlation of mice with attenuated mutant meningococcal strains\ninduces cross-reactive immune responses [9]. These findings\nindicate that natural exposure (to either N. meningitidis or N.\nlactamica) can provide long-term, cross-reactive protection, how-\never the identity of the antigens involved remains unknown. They\nare unlikely to be the well characterised class 1, 2 and 5 Outer\nMembrane Proteins (OMPs) since these antigens do not induce a\ncross-reactive bactericidal immune responses in immunized\nvolunteers [10].\nThe proteome of both the serogroup B strain, MC58 [11],\nand the serogroup A strain, Z4970 [12], as well as the\ncomposition of OMV preparations from both N. meningitidis\n[13,14,15,16,17] and N. lactamica [13,14,17] have been cata-\nlogued using a combination of 2D SDS-PAGE gels and mass\nspectrometry (reviewed by Wheeler et al. [18]). However, the\nproteome itself does not provide information as to which proteins\nare immunogenic. By combining proteomics with immunoblot-\nting it is possible to generate an immunoproteome that\ncatalogues those proteins that are recognized by the host\nimmune response. This immunoproteomics approach has been\napplied to a wide of range of organisms including M. tuberculosis\n[19], Streptococcus pneumonia [20], Staphylococcus epidermidis [21] and\nCandida albicans [22]. In many cases this has led to the\nidentification of novel antigens that have been demonstrated to\nbe protective in animal models [20,21,22]. We here, apply\nimmunoproteomic approaches to N. meningitidis to identify\nproteins that bind IgG from acute and convalescent meningo-\ncoccal patient\u2019s sera with the aim of further understanding the\nimmune response to neisserial infection and to potentially\nidentify new cross-protective neisserial antigens.\nResults\n2D electrophoresis and Western blots\nProteins extracted from N. meningitidis L91543 were separated by\n2D gel electrophoresis and western blotted with sera from acute\nand convalescent patients (Table 1). Up to 473 separate protein\nspots could be distinguished on the 2D gels (Fig 1).

Many proteins were recognized by several\nsera while others were specific to a single serum sample. As\nexpected, all the acute sera bound to fewer spots than their paired\nconvalescent sera. Unfortunately there was insufficient patient\ninformation to attempt to relate immunogenic profiles to patient\ndetails. No correlation to the infecting strain serotypes was\napparent, nor was there any obvious correlation to SBA titres\n(most of the acute sera had high levels of complement independent\nkilling so an SBA titre could not be obtained). Replicate western\nblots identified similar spot patterns.\nAlthough 2D gels of OMVs clearly had different protein profiles\nto gels with total protein preparations, no novel antigens were\nidentified when they were western blotted with the three mixed\nconvalescent sera (Table 2).\nIdentification of antigens\nImmunogenic proteins were excised from the gels and identified\nby mass spectrometry. Of the 88 spots that were detected on the\nwestern blots, 54 were successfully identified by mass spectrom-\netry, representing 33 different proteins (Table 2, Table S1). Many\nof the proteins were identified from more than one spot, often with\nthe same molecular weight but with differing pI values.\nPresumably, these represent isoforms of the same protein that\nretain their immunogenicity. Some of these isoforms appear to be\nimmunologically distinct from each other. For instance spots 105\nand 106, both identified as SucC were recognized by IgG in\nconvalescent sera from patient 1, however the spot adjacent to 106\nthat was also identified as SucC, but did not bind IgG (Fig 1).\nThe immunogenic proteins identified (Table 2) represent a wide\nrange of functions, including chaperones, ribosomal proteins and\nmany that are involved in central metabolism. Most of these\nproteins are predicted to be cytoplasmic and therefore are not\nexpected to be directly accessible to the immune system in intact\ncells. This was despite the presence of many of the established\nouter membrane antigenic proteins such as PorA, PorB, Opa, and\nRmpM on the 2D gels.\nCloning, Expression and Confirmation of antigens\nGenes encoding the protein antigens were PCR amplified and\ncloned into the expression vector, pET101. Eighty two percent of\nthe proteins were successfully expressed. Most of these recombi-\nnant proteins were demonstrated, by western blotting, to bind the\npatient sera with which they were originally identified (Table 3),\nconfirming that the mass spectrometry identification was correct.\nOf those tested only the putative nucleotidase NMB2015, 50S\nFigure 2. An example western blot of a 2D gel of total protein. Total N. meningitidis proteins separated by 2D gel electrophoresis using a non-\nlinear pI 4\u20137 1st dimension, western blotted, and probed with convalescent sera from patient 3. Spots that were assigned protein identities are\nindicated. Spots with no protein legend have not been identified. Longer exposures of this blot revealed more spots (Table 2).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0005940.g002\nImmunity to Meningococcus\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 June 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 6 | e5940\nribosomal protein L4 (NMB0143) and a putative phosphate acetyl\ntransferase, NMB0631, did not bind the original patient sera\nindicating that either the wrong spot was picked from the 2D gels,\nthat the protein was mis-identified or that the recombinant protein\nhas lost the epitopes that were present on the native protein.\nELISAs with recombinant proteins and cell lysates\nRecombinant proteins were used to raise sera in mice. All of the\nsera gave ELISA titers of .1:10,000 against recombinant protein\nexcept for FtsZ which had a titer of 1:80. In ELISAs with cells that\nhad been heat killed and sonicated, all of the sera except for FtsZ,\nPilT-2, Adk, AcnB and HisD recognized antigens from the\nmeningococcal cells, indicating that they were present in amounts\nand in a conformation that could be recognized by the sera raised\nagainst the recombinant protein.\nSerum Bactericidal Assays\nNone of the successfully expressed antigens identified in this\nstudy gave a positive SBA of $1:4. Control assays using OMVs\nand recombinant fHBP consistently gave titres .1:512. No killing\nwas seen in control wells lacking either active complement, sera, or\nboth.\nFlow cytometry\nThe subcellular location of antigenic proteins was investigated\nby flow cytometry. Sera raised against the meningococcal surface\nprotein, fHBP was used as a positive control (Fig 3a), while sera\nraised in mice immunised with PBS was used as a negative control.\nSeveral of the recombinant proteins raised IgG that bound to the\nsurface of whole, live cells. RplY was clearly available on the\nsurface, with a significant shift in the fluorescence of the entire\npopulation (p = 0.001) (Fig 3b). Sera raised against RmpM, CysK\nand AcnB also showed small but significant shifts in fluorescence of\nthe total population as well as a small but significant subpopulation\nof cells with relatively high levels of fluorescence (Fig 3). The\nsubpopulations with high fluorescence had similar side scatter and\nforward scatter profiles to the whole population indicating that the\ncells were intact.\nDiscussion\nOur aim in this study was to begin to characterize the\nmeningococcal immunoproteome and possibly to identify novel\nantigens that are the targets of natural cross-protective immunity.\nBy using a combination of 2D gels, western blots and proteomics,\nwe identified a set of proteins that were recognized by sera from\nboth acute and convalescent patients suffering from meningococ-\ncal septicaemia. This approach contrasts with previous studies\naimed at identifying naturally occurring immunological responses\nsuch as Litt et al. [47], in that preconceived criteria, such as in silico\npredications of protein function, were not applied.\nBoth the number and identity of the proteins identified by each\nsera varied considerable. No antigen was recognized by all the sera\nand several antigens were recognised by only a small number of\npatient serum samples. The origin of this diversity of immune\nresponse is currently unknown. It is possible it represents innate\ndifferences in immunological responsiveness to the antigens, or\nvariations in antigenic exposure in different patients due to\nvariations in treatment timings or disease severity.\nThe antigens that were identified are a diverse group of\nproteins, ranging from known outer membrane proteins such as\nRmpM, to enzymes of central metabolism and ribosomal proteins\n(Table 2). Where possible the immunogenicity of the identified\nproteins was confirmed by cloning, protein expression and by\ndemonstrating that the recombinant proteins were recognized by\npatient sera (Table 3). Many of the proteins are predicted to be\nlocated in the cytoplasm or inner membrane of the meningococcus\nand so were not considered by Litt et al. [47] in their screen of\nimmunological responses to infection. Other studies that have used\nsimilar 2D gel\/western blot approaches to identify antigens have\nbeen undertaken using a range of organisms including Helicobacter\npylori [30] Chlamydia trachomatis [25], Borrelia burgdorferi [37], and\nMycobacteria tuberculosis [19]. These have also generated lists of\nantigenic proteins that contain large numbers of proteins with a\ncytosolic function. For instance, DnaK, CysK, FumB and AtpA\nhave all been identified from Brucella abortus as immunoreactive by\nConnolly et al. [42], while TufA, DnaK and RpsA have been\nidentified as immunoreactive in Chlamydia trachomatis [25]. The\nmost obvious explanation for these immune responses is that they\nare generated during episodes of septicaemia when killed\nmeningococcal cells release their cytoplasmic contents into the\ncirculation. Such a scenario would suggest that although these\nantigens may be involved in the immune response to septicaemic\nmeningococcal disease, they are unlikely to be good vaccine\ncandidates.\nHowever, we have demonstrated that several of these\n\u2018\u2018cytoplasmic\u2019\u2019 proteins were present on the surface of neisserial\ncells and so may be involved in immune responses that are\nrelevant to live meningococcal cells. The presence of neisserial\n\u2018\u2018cytoplasmic\u2019\u2019 proteins on the surface has been reported\npreviously, for example Ferrari et al. [48] found enolase, Hsp60,\nTufA and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase on the\nneisserial surface by flow cytometry while other researchers have\nidentified RplL [23,24], DnaK [41], and LpdA2 [45] as being\nsurface exposed.

comparable to those\nfound with recognised surface antigens such as NMB1468 [49],\nNMB2132 and NMB2091 [5], although considerably lower than\nother surface antigens such as fHBP [5]. A different pattern of\nsurface localization was found for CysK and AcnB, were flow\ncytometry indicated that the proteins were surface exposed at\nrelatively high amounts but only in a subpopulation of cells.\nSimilar results were obtained in these experiments with RmpM, a\nknown outer membrane protein. Such heterogeneity in surface\nexpression has been found with several proteins in Streptococcus\npneumoniae and has been attributed to variation in capsule\nmorphology [50]. As we used a capsulated strain it is possible\nthat variations in meningococcal capsule morphology may\nsimilarly expose meningococcal antigens to recognition by the\nhost immune response in a proportion of the neisserial population.\nAlternatively, surface exposure of these proteins may be transient,\nonly occurring during specific phase of the meningococcal cell\ncycle, or be subject to phase variation.\nNone of the identified immunogenic proteins generated murine\nimmune sera with bactericidal activity. For those proteins not\nexpressed on the surface it is likely that the absence of SBA activity\nis due to lack of accessibility of antibody to the antigens. For those\nproteins with either low or transient surface expression it seems\nlikely that either the level of antigen on the surface is insufficient to\npromote bactericidal killing or, for transiently expressed proteins,\nonly a fraction of the population may be killed. Such proteins\nwould be missed by the current bactericidal assays.\nThese data represent the first proteome wide investigation of the\nnaturally induced immune response to neisserial infection with\nimplications for the understanding of the immune response to\nsepticaemic infection. The antigens identified demonstrate that\nmeningococcal patients have highly variable immune responses\nagainst a wide range of meningococcal antigens. All the sera tested\ncontain antibodies capable of binding a range of neisserial\nproteins, including many \u2018\u2018cytoplasmic\u2019\u2019 proteins, some of which\nare for the first time shown to be available to IgG on the surface of\nwhole neisserial cells. Although not sufficient to promote\ndetectable complement mediated killing, immune responses\nagainst these antigens may still be involved in the pathogenesis\nand immunity to meningococcal disease.\nMaterials and Methods\nProtein preparation\nNeisseria meningitidis L91543 was used thoughout (obtained from\nthe Manchester Public Health Laboratory, UK), this is a group\nC:2a:P1.2, and part of the ST-11, ET-37 complexes. Although\nsuch a serogroup C strain is not suited to the identification of\nvaccine antigens aimed at serogroup B Neisseria, it is applicable for\nthe identification of the cross reactive antigens which this study\naimed to discover. Protein for 2D gels was prepared from cultures\ngrown for 4 h on Columbia Agar Base supplemented with 6%\nhorse blood (CAB) at 37uC with 5% CO2. Cells were washed in\nPBS and proteins prepared using a ProteoPrepH Sample\nExtraction Kit (Sigma). Cells were resuspended in Reagent 4\nand sonicated for 10 min. The cells were centrifuged for 5 min\nand the pellet discarded, freshly prepared Tributylphosphine\n(TBP) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture incubated\nfor 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were alkylated with\niodoacetamide (IAA) for 1.5 h at room temperature. OMVs were\nprepared using sodium deoxycholate from 4 h old CAB plate\ncultures according to Fredriksen et al.

These immunogenic spots were picked and washed\ntwice for 20 min each with 50% acetonitrile (ACN), 50% 400 mM\nNH4HCO3 (ABC). Gel plugs were left in 100% ACN for 10 min\nand then air dried. The plugs were incubated in 10 mM DTT in\n50 mM ABC for 30 min at 60uC followed by 30 min at room\ntemperature in the dark with 100 mM IAA in 100 mM ABC. The\ngel plugs were again washed twice in 50% ACN, 50% 400 mM\nABC and again incubated for 10 min in 100% ACN and air dried.\nThe pellet was digested for 3 h with 50 ng trypsin (Promega) in\n5 ml 10 mM ABC.\nMass spectrometry\nProteins were identified by Matrix-assisted laser desorption\ntime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) using a Bruker\nAutoflexH machine. Matrix solutions were freshly prepared by\ndissolving a-cyano-a-hydroxycinnamic acid (a-CCA) in acetone\nto saturation and spotted onto either a stainless steel or\nAnchorChipTM target plates and allowed to dry. A 0.5 ml drop\nof trypsin digested sample was placed on the matrix and the\npeptides allowed to adsorb for 1\u20132 min before being removed\nand the samples washed with 10% formic acid. Mass spectra\nwere acquired with between 300\u20131200 laser pulses in positive\nreflective mode with an acceleration voltage of 19 kV. Samples\nwere calibrated with Peptide Calibration Standard (Bruker). The\npeptide masses were obtained from the spectra using XMASS\n5.1 (Bruker) and used to search the neisserial proteins in the\nNCBI database using MASCOT (Matrix Science) with search\ncriteria of 50 ppm error, fixed modifications of carbamidomethyl\nmodified cysteine residues, variable modifications of oxidised\nmethionines and allowing 1 missed trypsin cleavage. Protein\nidentities were considered reliable if the expected probability was\n,0.05 (details of methods are available in Document S1 and\nTable S2).\nCloning and expression\nProteins that had been identified by MALDI analysis were\ncloned and expressed using the pET101-TOPO system (Invitro-\ngen). Primers for the N and C terminals of the annotated ORFs\nfrom N. meningitidis MC58 genome (http:\/\/cmr.tigr.org) were\nused to PCR amplify products from L91543 genomic DNA\nprepared according to Bjorvatin et al. [53]. PCR reactions\ncontained 10 mM Tris pH 8.8, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM (NH4)2SO4,\n2 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM primers, 0.02 U ml\n21 Pwo (Roche) and\n0.2 mM dNTPs. Cycle conditions were 94uC for 5 min, followed\nby 35 cycles of 94uC for 30 sec, 58uC for 30 sec and 72uC for\n2 min, followed by 5 min at 72uC. Products were mixed with\npET101-TOPO vector and transformed into TOP10 cells\n(Invitrogen). The correct constructs were identified by PCR\nand restriction digests, and the plasmids transformed in BL21\ncells. The pET21b plasmid expressing factor H binding protein\n(fHBP), NMB1870 was kindly supplied by Chris Tang (Imperial\nCollege, London). Proteins were expressed by growing BL21\ntransformants to approximately OD600 0.6 and inducing with\nIPTG to 1 mM. Cells were incubated for 3 h, the cultures\ncentrifuged and the pellet lysed by resuspending in BugBusterH\n(Novagen) with 2 mg ml21 DNase and 50 mg ml21 lysozyme for\n20 min. Lysates were centrifuged and the cleared supernatant\napplied to a previously equilibrated HisSelectTM (Sigma) column.\nThe column was washed with 50 mM NaPO4, pH 8, 0.3 M\nNaCl, 5 mM imadazole and the proteins eluted with 50 mM\nNaPO4, pH 8, 0.3 M NaCl, 250 mM imadazole. Proteins were\ndialysed against 10006 volumes of PBS and quantified using a\n2D Quant kit (Amersham).\nMouse Immunizations\nRecombinant proteins were used to generate serum according\nto Giuliani et al. [5]. Briefly, female, NIH mice were immunised\nsubcutaneously on days 0, 21 and 35 with 20 mg protein each,\ninitially with Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant and subsequently with\nNMB Name Protein Confirmeda Literature\nn\/a Opa900(FAM18), not in MC58 n\/a nd Well documented OMP\naRecombinant proteins that were confirmed as binding their identifying sera are indicated (Y), those that failed to bind their identifying sera are indicated (N) and those\nthat were not determined, either because no recombinant protein was generated or because no more sera was available are indicated (nd).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0005940.t003\nTable 3. cont.\nImmunity to Meningococcus\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 June 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 6 | e5940\nFreund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant. Blood was collected on day 49 and\nthe serum frozen. Animals were housed and cared for according to\nUK Home Office codes of practice and experiments were\napproved by the University of Surrey Ethics Committee.\nELISAs\nFor ELISAs with recombinant protein, 50 ml of 2 mg ml21 was\nadded to each MaxisorpTM (Nunc) microtiter well and incubated\novernight at 4uC. For whole cell ELISAs, bacteria were grown for\nFigure 3. Flow cytometry of live N. meningitidis stained with mouse sera immunised with recombinant proteins.

Cells were heated at 56uC for 30 min, followed\nby 5 min of sonication and 50 ml added to MaxisorpTM ELISA\nwells and dried. All plates were washed three times in PBS-Tw and\nblocked for 90 min at 37uC with 50 ml PBS containing 10%\nblocking agent (Roche). A serial dilution of serum in PBS with\n10% blocking agent was added to the wells and the plates\nincubated for 2 h at 37uC. Plates were washed three times with\nPBS-Tw and anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) diluted\n1:10,000 in PBS with 10% blocking agent added. Plates were\nincubated for 1 h in the dark at 37uC and washed three times in\nPBS-Tw. Colour reagent, 3,39,5,59-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)\nwas dissolved in 0.05 M phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5 containing\n10% DMSO and added to each well, the colour was allowed to\ndevelop and the reaction stopped by adding H2SO4 to 0.4 M. The\nOD450 of each well was measured. Titres were determined as the\nlast dilution at which the OD450 was greater than 0.1 and more\nthan twice the value for the equivalent dilution containing negative\nsera (from mice immunised with PBS alone).\nSerum Bactericidal Assays\nSerum Bactericidal Assays (SBAs) were carried out according to\nBorrow and Carlone [54]. Briefly, N. meningitidis, L91543, grown\novernight on CAB were inoculated into Mueller Hinton broth to\nan OD600 0.1, and shaken at 35uC for 4 h. Cultures were diluted\nto OD600 0.1 and then diluted a further 1:5,000, 10 ml was added\nto microtiter wells containing a 10 ml of a 1:4 dilution of baby\nrabbit complement (Serotech, UK) and 20 ml of a twofold serial\ndilution of heat denatured (56uC for 30 min) sera. Plates were\nincubated for 1 h and samples plated onto CAB media. Each assay\nincluded control wells with either no sera, heat inactivated\ncomplement, or neither sera nor active complement. Positive\nwells were those containing 50% of the number of cells in the\ncontrol wells. SBA results for recombinant proteins were\ncompared to sera from mice immunised with PBS alone, OMVs\n(as a positive control for the SBA), and the known bactericidal\nantigen fHBP (assayed with N. meningitidis MC58, as a positive\ncontrol for the recombinant protein production and immunization\nprotocols)\nFlow Cytometry\nN. meningitidis for flow cytometry were grown for 4 h on CAB,\nresuspended in PBS and adjusted to an OD600 of 1. A 20 ml\nvolume of cells was centrifuged, the pellet resuspended in 10 ml\nheat denatured sera and incubated for 30 min at 37uC. The cells\nwere washed three times in 100 ml PBS-Tw and resuspended in\n100 ml 4% paraformaldehyde for 18 h at 4uC. Cells were washed\nthree time in 100 ml PBS-Tw and resuspended in 20 ml anti-mouse\nIgG conjugated to FITC (Sigma) diluted 1:50 in PBS. Cells were\nincubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, washed\nthree times in PBS-Tw and resuspended in 1 ml PBS. Fluores-\ncence was measured with a BD FACSCantoTM Flow Cytometer\nrecording 10,000 events and the data compared to samples\ncontaining either no cells, or cells stained with sera from mice\nimmunised with fHBP, OMV preparations or PBS alone. Data\nwere analysed using WinMDI, recorded events were gated with\nreference to the control samples and the population statistics\ndetermined from triplicate experiments.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Mass Spectrometry Data\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0005940.s001 (0.05 MB\nXLS)\nTable S2 MS exclusion list\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0005940.s002 (0.03 MB\nXLS)\nDocument S1 Parameters for MS data acquisition and database\nsearching\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0005940.s003 (0.03 MB\nDOC)\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Stephane Camuzeax for his assistance and\nadvice in operating the MALDI-TOF.
