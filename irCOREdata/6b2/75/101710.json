This paper defines crises and disasters before \ndiscussing the area of crisis communication management and crisis communication in the \ntourism industry.

The response was limited in part because \nof a lack of preparedness, but also due to the nature of the foot and mouth outbreak, and \nthe speed and severity of international media coverage. Action was taken in the \nemergency phase of the crisis and was reactive involving inconsistency in developing key \nmessages to stakeholders, partly due to confusion and a lack of information at the \nnational level. Recovery marketing was also limited due to the length of time of the \ndisease outbreak. This paper provides lessons for destinations and organisations are \ndiscussed which may help develop crisis communication strategies for tourism \norganisations. \n 2 \n \nKeywords: Tourism, Disaster, Crisis, Communication, United Kingdom, Foot and \nMouth \n \nDr Brent W.

A total of 2030 cases of the disease were \nidentified and a total of over 4 million animals were culled during the crisis with \nworldwide media broadcasts showing burning carcasses of culled animals. The English \nTourism Council (ETC) predicted that losses to English tourism in 2001 would be \u00a35bn, \nwhile in 2002 and 2003 reductions would total \u00a32.5bn and \u00a31bn respectively (ETC, \n2001a).  On January 15th 2002 government officials announced that the disease had \nfinally been defeated after 11 months of battling the outbreak. Despite the end of the \ndisease, the outbreak has deeply affected the farming and tourism industry and raised \nquestions concerning government policy toward the farming and tourism industry. \nQuestions have been specifically raised concerning the responsiveness and preparedness \nof the tourism industry for the FMD and the ability of tourist promotion agencies to \nreduce the negative media coverage due to slow response time. Although the outbreak \nwas not expected, Faulkner (2001) notes there are an increasing number of disasters and \ncrises which affect the tourism industry, ranging from natural to human influenced \ndisasters.  This has been made most evident since the events of September 11th 2001, \nwhich dramatically impacted upon the tourism industry illustrating the need to \nunderstand and effectively manage such incidents, with crisis communication an \nimportant part of this management.   \n \nFaulkner (2001) argues that there is a lack of research on disaster phenomena in the \ntourism industry, on the impacts of such events on both the industry and specific \n 4 \norganisations, and the responses of the tourism industry to disasters.  Yet Lee and Harrald \n(1999:184) note that crisis management, disaster recovery, and organisational continuity \nare important competencies for managers in both the public and private sector.  This \npaper aims to address these deficiencies as well as to consider FMD in the light of crisis \ncommunication, as it appears that communication is an important aspect of effectively \nand efficiently dealing with crisis situations. An examination of the management of the \nFMD and the crisis communication strategies employed may assist other destinations and \norganisations in developing crisis management and crisis communication strategies to \ndeal with unforeseen events. First a discussion of crisis management definitions and crisis \ncommunication theory takes place prior to discussion of crisis communication \nspecifically for the tourism industry. Then the paper outlines the research methods and \nresearch findings related to crisis communication and the FMD outbreak in the UK. \n \nCrisis and Disaster Definitions \nA number of authors have attempted to define a crisis to help improve their \nunderstanding of this phenomenon. Pauchant and Mitroff (1992:15) believe that a crisis is \na \u201cdisruption that physically affects a system as a whole and threatens its basic \nassumptions, its subjective sense of self, its existential core.\u201d Selbst (1978 in Faulkner \n2001:136) defines a crisis as \u201cany action or failure to act that interferes with an \norganisation\u2019s ongoing functions, the acceptable attainment of its objectives, its viability \nor survival, or that has a detrimental personal effect as perceived by the majority of its \nemployees, clients or constituents.\u201d Selbst focus on perceptions implies that if an \norganisation\u2019s publics or stakeholders perceive a crisis, a real crisis could evolve from \n 5 \nthis misconception, illustrating that perception management is a key activity in managing \ncrises.  \n \nFaulkner (2001) considers the principal distinction between what can be termed a \u2018crisis\u2019 \nand a \u2018disaster\u2019 to be the extent to which the situation is attributable to the organisation \nitself, or can be described as originating outside the organisation.  Thus, a \u2018crisis\u2019 \ndescribes a situation \u201cwhere the root cause of an event is, to some extent, self-inflicted \nthrough such problems as inept management structures and practices or a failure to adapt \nto change\u201d, while a \u201cdisaster can be defined as \u201cwhere an enterprise\u2026is confronted with \nsudden unpredictable catastrophic changes over which it has little control\u201d (Faulkner, \n2001:136).  \n \nCrisis Management and Control \nLee and Harrald (1999:184) state that \u201cnatural disasters can disrupt the supply and \ndistribution chains for even the best prepared businesses\u2026service businesses are \nincreasingly vulnerable to electrical, communication and other critical infrastructure \nfailures.\u201d  Kash and Darling (1998:179) agree, and claim that it is no longer a case \u2018if\u2019 a \nbusiness will face a crisis; it is rather a question of \u2018when\u2019, \u2018what type\u2019 and \u2018how \nprepared\u2019 the organisation is to deal with it.  Both statements illustrate that although \norganisations are able to design pre-crisis strategies to help with crisis management they \nare often unable to prevent a crisis from occurring. However, the real challenge is to \nrecognise crises in a timely fashion and implement coping strategies to limit their damage \n(Darling et al., 1996). Authors such as Burnett (1998) and Kash and Darling (1998) note \nthat decisions undertaken before a crisis occurs will enable more effective management \n 6 \nof the crisis, rather than organisations being managed by the crisis and making hasty and \nineffective decisions. Proactive planning through the use of strategic planning and issues \nmanagement will help reduce risk, time wastage, poor resource management and reduce \nthe impacts of those that do arise (Heath, 1998).   \n \nCoombs (1999) notes, all crises are different and crisis managers need to tailor responses \nto individual crises rather than try to plan for every individual situation. Heath (1998:272) \nagrees and states that \u201cno crisis has exactly the same form, the same time limitations, the \nsame demand for resources\u2026or the same temporal, social and economic threats.\u201d  In \naddition crises are indefinite, numerous, unexpected and unpredictable (Parsons, 1996; \nWilliams et al. 1998). Authors such as Kash and Darling (1998) believe that although \ncrisis management is a requirement for organisations, and although business leaders \nrecognise this, many do not undertake productive steps to address crisis situations.  \n \nOther crisis management research has focussed on the stages of crises to assist in \nunderstanding crisis phenomenon and assist in proactive and strategic management of \ncrises (see Richardson, 1994; 1995).  Fink (1986) and Roberts (1994) both developed \nslightly different models to explain the lifecycle of crises (see table 1). Faulkner (2001) \ndeveloped the first tourism specific disaster management framework and subsequently \napplied this framework to the Katherine Floods in Australia (see Faulkner & Vikulov, \n2001).   \n \n \n 7 \nAlthough understanding the nature of crises are important, understanding how to manage \ncrises are more critical. In particular, managing communication and perceptions through \na crisis communication strategy can limit the negative media coverage and manage \nperceptions both during a crisis or disaster and at the recovery\/resolution stage. Crisis \ncommunication and marketing is important to provide information to key publics and to \nhelp tourism destinations limit the impact of a crisis as well as help them recover from \nincidents by safeguarding the destination image and reputation which is of immense \nvalue to tourism destinations. The development of crisis communication and marketing \nstrategies by organisations is therefore a critical competency for tourism managers. \n \n \nCrisis Communication and Crisis Marketing \nCrisis management literature emphasises the need to have a detailed communication \nstrategy as the media can encourage the flow and the intensity of a crisis or even turn an \nincident into a crisis (Keown-McMullan, 1997). Barton (1994) believes that a strategic \ncrisis plan can help limit the damage from a crisis and allow an organisation to \nconcentrate on dealing with the crisis at hand. Marra (1998:461) notes that poor \ncommunication strategies can often make the crisis worse as a deluge of questions is \noften asked from a wide range of stakeholders including reporters, employees, \nstockholders, government officials and public residents. The initial response is important \nand table 2 illustrates five main considerations for responding to crises. \n \n 8 \nResponding quickly to demands of the media and publics is important as the media have \ndeadlines to work to and are looking for quick sources of information.  If the crisis team \ndoes not fill the void, someone else will (Coombs, 1999). Zerman (1995:25) agrees \nstating that \u201cthe mass media has the power to make a break a business.\u201d Sensationalist \nmedia coverage of the 1980 Mt St Helens disaster and the 1985 East Kootenay forest \nfires were noted as contributing to confusion during the emergency phase as the media \nwere blamed for misleading public opinion concerning the severity of the disasters. This \nalso impacted upon the long term recovery phase for the destination (see Murphey and \nBayley, 1989). However, difficulties have been noted in managing the media as it is \nunlikely that there will be a time delay between the start of any crisis and media coverage \n(Ashcroft, 1997). \n \nCrisis communication is mainly concerned with providing correct and consistent \ninformation to the public and enhancing the image of the organisation or industry sector \nfaced with a crisis. An emphasis on communication and public relations is required to \nlimit harm to an organisation in an emergency that could ultimately create irreparable \ndamage. Co-operation with the media is considered vital because the media provides \ninformation to the public (Berry, 1999), illustrating the need to keep the media briefed \nfrequently so misinformation is reduced. Regular two-way communication is the best \nway of developing a favourable relationship with publics (Coombs, 1999:134). \nConsistency of response is also noted as a key element in crisis communication. The \nability to provide a consistent message to all stakeholders will build credibility and \npreserve the image of an organisation instead of tarnishing reputations through providing \n 9 \ninconsistent messages (Coombs, 1999). Barton (1994) believes that many issues are \noverlooked by crisis managers regarding crisis communication, namely to focus on \nidentifying the audience, developing goals for communicating effectively and creating \nstrong positive messages.  \n \nMarketing and advertising is also noted as an important part of crisis communication, \nespecially during the long term recovery stage of a crisis or disaster. As Heath (1998:26) \nnotes \u201ccrisis management is as much about dealing with human perceptions about the \ncrisis as it is about physically resolving the crisis situation.\u201d  This suggests that crisis \ncommunication is an essential part of managing crises and disasters and will be an \nimportant consideration for the tourism industry. \n \nCrisis Communication in the Tourism Industry \nDespite the susceptibility of the tourism industry to external and internal crises and \ndisasters, and the importance of destination image and marketing, little research has been \nundertaken concerning crisis communication for the tourism industry. As Beeton \n(2001:422) notes: \n \ncrises occur at all levels of tourism operations with varying degrees of severity, \nfrom much publicised environmental economic and political disasters through to \ninternally generated crisis such as accidents and sudden illness. \n \n 10 \nCrises can impact negatively upon destination image, especially if it is dramatised or \ndistorted through rumours. Henderson (1999:108) states that \u201cNational Tourist \nOrganisations with their responsibility for general destination marketing, research and \ndevelopment have an important role to play in the process of travel and tourism crisis \nmanagement, representing and acting on behalf of the industry as a whole.\u201d This quote \nemphasises the importance of a national tourist organisation in responding to crises, \nimplementing crisis communication strategies and designing recovery marketing \ncampaigns. However, Henderson (1999) found that in the case of the Asian Economic \nCrisis, the Singapore Tourist Board implemented reactive strategies which took time to \nimplement reducing their effectiveness.  \n \nSo\u00f1mez et al (1999) noted the importance for marketers to have a prepared crisis \ncommunication and marketing plan, as the cost of this will be far less than the costs \nassociated with a downturn in visitor confidence and visitation due to a slow response. \nSo\u00f1mez et al. (1999) suggest several ways to improve crisis communication for tourism \ncrisis management including the preparation of a task force involving the private and \npublic sector including a PR team, recovery marketing team, information coordination \nteam and a finance and fund raising team.  \n \nThe development of Fiji\u2019s Tourism Action Group (TAG) during the military coups \nillustrates the advantages of forming such as group. Fiji\u2019s tourist industry responded \nfaster than expected because of the implementation of a task force combined with target \nmarketing to restore confidence. As So\u00f1mez et al. (1999:8) note \u201cit is imperative for \n 11 \ndestinations to augment their crisis management plans with marketing efforts, to recover \nlost tourism by rebuilding a positive image.\u201d  \n \nResearch Methods \nResearch was carried out to examine the effectiveness of the crisis communication of the \nBritish Tourist Authority at the national level and an unnamed District Council at the \nlocal level in England. This research was carried out by two separate yet linked research \nprojects that explored similar themes concerning crisis communication specifically \nassociated with the FMD in the United Kingdom.  \n \nSecondary and Primary Research Strategy \nThroughout both pieces of research, the researchers undertook thorough secondary data \nanalysis of press releases, newspaper articles, position statements and relevant marketing \ndocuments and policies related to the FMD and the organisations under study. Primary \nresearch was carried out in both pieces of research through the use of in-depth semi-\nstructured interviews to supplement the secondary data collected. All interviews were \nundertaken in January and February 2002 and the following outlines the procedures \nundertaken for each project. \n \nIn the study at the national level, tourism representatives were selected judgementally \nfrom the British Tourist Authority (BTA) and key industry sector groups that represent \nthe national interests of tourism and hospitality businesses. These representatives were \ninterviewed for between 45 minutes and an hour and a half, and a tape recorder was used \n 12 \nto record the interviews for later transcription. All were interviewed concerning the \nresponse of the British Tourist Authority to the crisis and their effectiveness in \nimplementing crisis communication strategies. Although the BTA was the focus of the \nstudy, in order to avoid bias other tourism organisations were selected on the basis of \ntheir ability to judge the effectiveness of BTA\u2019s crisis marketing and communication \nstrategy. Representatives from the various industry organisations were elite interviews at \nthe managerial or CEO level and were well informed and had a high level of expertise \nand knowledge. Something which Saunders et al. (2000) note is important in undertaking \na judgmental sample selection. Confidentiality was provided to all respondents and \ntherefore no respondents are identified in this paper. From the literature several themes \nwere investigated within the interviews and corresponded with Coombs (1999) themes \nfor responding to crises through communication. The researcher classified the data into \nemerging themes based upon Coombs (1999) classification and transcribed, read and re-\nread the transcriptions before placing comments into themes which are discussed in the \nresults below.  \n \nIn the study at the District Council level tourism representatives were selected \njudgementally from the District Council and also included 5 representatives from the \naccommodation industry, local tourism attraction and visitor group, the National Trust, \nand an individual operator. They were interviewed for between 45 minutes and an hour \nand a half while Faulkner\u2019s (2001) disaster response grid and disaster framework were \nused as a guide to the semi-structured interviews. The representative of the District \nCouncil was interviewed first and then industry representatives were interviewed. Similar \n 13 \nto the national level study the researcher tape-recorded and transcribed the interviews and \nplaced them into themes based on Faulkner\u2019s (2001) tourism disaster framework model \nand relating them to crisis communication theory and literature where applicable.  \n \nPotential Limitations and Bias \nAlthough relevant industry and government representatives were interviewed concerning \ncrisis communication strategies implemented by the BTA and the District Council, these \nrepresentatives do not represent the views of industry who do not belong to these \norganisations or who do not share their view. The BTA and the District Council avoided \nanswering some questions directly in relation to its activities. Although other \norganisations were able to examine the role of the BTA and District Council, as Alreck \nand Settle (1997) note, affinity bias may exist as some of these representatives have a \nclose working relationship with the organisations under study. Some respondents may \nhave been concerned that their comments would make their way back to these \norganisations, despite assurances of confidentiality.     \n \nInterviewer bias is possible but was reduced through the use in both instances of semi-\nstructured techniques and a set of themes developed from the literature which were used \nto structure the interview. Researchers did not make any personal opinions during the \ninterviews and used a similar tone of voice and dress throughout, which have been noted \nto minimise interviewer bias (Saunders et al., 2000).  \n \n 14 \nResults and Discussion \nDue to space constraints not all results can be presented in this paper. The following \nsection first outlines the development of a crisis response strategy, before discussing \nrespondents response time, the consistency of crisis communication strategies, access to \ninformation, and finally, the implementation of recovery marketing strategies. Where \napplicable the results are compared and contrasted with literature and theory discussed \nearlier in the paper. \n \nCrisis Response Strategy \nAt the national level tourism industry representatives believed that the BTA failed to \nreact sufficiently and effectively, as they did not appear to have a crisis management \nstrategy in place prior to the outbreak. Nevertheless, the BTA stressed that they did have \na \u201cfairly basic crisis management strategy in place\u201d although the British Hospitality \nAssociation believed that it was too little too late (Cotton, 2001). Having an established \nand formal crisis communication strategy may have reduced the response time and \ndeveloped quicker communication channels to facilitate the distribution of information \nand the reduction in inconsistent messages (discussed later). The BTA excused the \ninsufficiency by explaining that the intensity of the FMD could not be forecast. \nNevertheless, they acknowledged that the FMD has taught them \u201chow to have an even \nbetter crisis response strategy (in the future).\u201d  \n \nSimilar findings were discovered at the local level with the District Council noting that \n\u201cthere was something on file from the previous foot and mouth outbreak but not \n 15 \nmuch\u2026there was only a rumour that there was one (a disaster plan) lying around.\u201d \nAlthough they did have one regarding foot and mouth it was last examined briefly after \nthe 1967 outbreak. Furthermore, from industry representatives interviewed none had a \ncrisis plan in place for their own business before the outbreak. Perhaps more surprisingly \nthe tourism industry seemed to have learnt little from their experience at the local level. \nAccording to one representative \u201cI don\u2019t know whether people would have (a plan) in the \nfuture because I think that people felt that it has happened once and couldn\u2019t happen \nagain.\u201d Only two people expressed an interest in developing a crisis management plan in \nthe future, because crises are seen as infrequent and that little can be done to alter their \nimpacts. The only contingency considered was setting aside money and resources to deal \nwith unforeseen events. However, crisis management theory suggests that established \nplans can limit the severity of crises and disasters through proactive contingency planning \n(Kash and Darling, 1998; Heath, 1998).  \n \nResponse Time in the Emergency Phase \nBecause of a combination of a delay in identifying foot and mouth, a disbelief of the \nseverity of such a crisis and a lack of proactive planning, there was a delay in reacting to \nthe crisis by the tourism industry at both a national and local level. Both the BTA and \nindustry at the national and local level only accepted the implications of the outbreak at \nthe emergency phase and reacted only due to negative publicity. The BTA in their media \nreleases noted this in a statement issued by the head of EU Affairs in Brussels which \nstated \u201cin dealing with the Belgian media, the current tactics are more reactive than \nproactive\u201d (BTA 2001a). Although in the personal interview the BTA insisted that they \n 16 \nreacted within the first three days of the outbreak it was not until 28 March (one month \nlater) that a BTA board meeting took place to co-ordinate communications and prepare a \nrecovery plan for England. Industry representatives at the national level agreed that the \nresponse of the tourism sector generally had been slow and the power and effect of the \nmedia had been under-evaluated. However, the response of the BTA was to attempt to \nmarket and improve the image of the UK to target markets but this process was hampered \nby the ongoing outbreak and continued spread of the disease throughout the UK. \n \nAt the local level, the majority of respondents did not believe the implications of the \noutbreak until the emergency phase. According to one respondent \u201cwe knew what was \ngoing on, but we were trying not to think about it.\u201d Furthermore, another respondent \ndescribed decision making as \u201cmainly stabbing in the dark.\u201d  This slow response could be \nbecause the initial outbreaks were in other districts and there seemed to be confusion \nabout the potential impacts and what should be done about them. Little communication \nwas occurring between decision makers at the national level and the local level. A lack of \nknowledge of the disease and its implications meant that footpaths and attractions were \nclosed and the District Council sought advise over what to do as they did not want to put \ntourism businesses at risk. This decision making was further complicated by mixed \nmessages at the national level by government over whether the countryside was closed or \nactually open for business, illustrating that consistency in responding to the crisis and \ncommunicating positive messages to key audience groups was lacking. \n \n 17 \nInconsistency of Responses \nThis inconsistency of messages sent out by tourism organisations and other government \nagencies involved in handling the disease impacted upon the dissemination of facts and \nfigures concerning the disease, but more importantly confused potential tourists\u2019 and the \ntourism industry. Coombs (1999) suggests that consistency is important to avoid \nspeculation and confusion. In the case of the FMD both were evident at the national and \nlocal level. The international market confused the outbreak with the BSE disease and \nsome had the perception that it was deadly to humans. The domestic public was unsure \nwhether they should try and help rural economies by visiting such areas or whether they \ncould best help by staying home and not spreading the disease. This statement is \nsupported by market research conducted by the English Tourism Council (2001b) that \nshowed consumers were still confused in June 2001, several months after the outbreak. \nContradicting statements were being published and this was even more confusing by the \nfact that many areas were totally unaffected by the disease. The BTA representative \ninterviewed noted that there was no united approach and that different messages and \nstatements were provided by different tourism and hospitality organisations. \n \nAnother potential problem which resulted in inconsistency in messages was the \nencroaching deadline for the government to announce a general election.  The \ngovernment held a strong lead over political rivals in the polls and had made little secret \nof its desire to face a spring election.  However, the images of burning cows saturating \nnews coverage meant an early election was impossible unless the disease could be \neradicated without risking the rural vote that was heavily influenced by the farmers.  Yet, \n 18 \nthe crisis\/disaster conflict reflects the multi-sectoral nature of industry in rural areas, and \nthere was disagreement over how the emergency stage should be handled and whether \nvaccination would be a better strategy than burning animals. This debate was held during \nthe emergency phase of the outbreak which suggests that decisions may not have been \nmade with thorough consideration for their impacts. It was the policy of slaughter and \nburn that ensured a negative media coverage and images, severely damaging the tourism \nindustry. \n \nInconsistency also occurred at the local level according to respondents. The District \nCouncil felt that in hindsight a more consistent approach was required. The Council \nstated \u201cwe were all calling for consistency at the same time, but the situation was moving \nso fast that no one seemed to be able to do it. I received 145 e-mails during this period, a \nlot of these were policy documents, technical specifications and general advice that \nwould change day by day and area by area.\u201d This lack of consistency was not the fault of \nthe District Council but their inability to answer queries created an information void and \ncreated what one respondent termed a \u201cknee jerk response.\u201d The combination of \nresources between the District Council (local level) and the County Council (regional \nlevel) also caused inconsistency and contradictory advice. As the District Council \nrespondent noted, \u201cthe County Council had put notices and signposts at the local level \nwhich stated that most footpaths in the County are closed, which was not effective when \nat the local level we were trying to encourage people to come to the area.\u201d It was not until \nafter April 2001 and the immediate phase of the crisis that co-ordination between the two \nbodies led to more consistency, but by then rumour and confusion had a damaging effect. \n 19 \nOne of the major reasons for this lack of consistency according to local level respondents \nwas a lack of access to relevant information.  \n \nAccess to Information \nThe BTA felt that the media was very intense for the first three months and at times their \nreporting was hostile, sometimes neutral but rarely friendly leading to misinformation \n(BTA 2001b). The BTA set up an Immediate Action Group (IAG) consisting of internal \nBTA staff from a range of departments to help implement strategies regarding the \noutbreak. The BTA also implemented a number of other measures to provide better \naccess to information and provide consistent and positive messages which are outlined in \ntable 3. \n \nInitially access to information was difficult due to uncertainty and slow response of the \nnational government. Although the development of communication channels was created \nby the BTA as information and policy was developed, many industry operators were \nsimply unable to access some of the information due to a lack of e-mail and Internet \nfacilities. For instance, in the South East of England only 60% of Tourist Information \nCentres had e-mail facilities and prior to the outbreak only six out of ten Regional Tourist \nBoards had web sites (DCMS 2001). The web site however, was useful for providing \ninformation to potential overseas visitors. \n \nAt the local level access to information was difficult and the District Council were unsure \nwhat to do and what the risks were to local farmland. As one respondent noted the \n 20 \n\u201cattractions were seeking advice as they did not know how they were going to be \naffected\u201d and were passed to different national organisations in search of information \nwhich was described by an industry respondent as \u201cfrustrating.\u201d Sources of information \nfollowed a long chain of command from national government, regional tourist boards, \ncounty councils to the local level. At the local level consistent messages were created by \npress and media contacts as well as briefing Tourist Information Centre staff regarding \nwhat attractions and footpaths were open. However, research indicated that staff had \ndetailed information concerning attractions, but little knowledge of footpaths which \nattract a number of hikers to the local region and are a major tourist asset. \n \nRecovery Marketing Strategies \nAs noted earlier, tourism organisations, especially NTOs are in a position to assist with \nthe marketing and recovery of destination image or reputation that may have been \ndamaged through a crisis or disaster. Recovery marketing at the national level was \ncomplicated by the fact that not all regional areas were affected by the outbreak and thus \nwondered what all of the fuss was about. As mentioned above some areas actually \nimproved their situation as holiday markers changed their travel patterns from rural or \ncountryside areas to coastal resorts (Wright, 2002). Certain attractions also benefited as \nvisitors changed from outdoor activities to indoor activities such as museums and \ngalleries.  \n \nThere were no tourism resources damaged by FMD to be repaired and the blackened \nimage of the UK could not be repaired until the disease had been defeated, despite many \n 21 \nareas of the UK having never been affected by the disease.  Thus, the nature of the \ndisaster meant that there was no \u201cturning point\u201d when a town was re-opened, or a \nbuilding restored or re-built, instead areas of the country gradually tried to persuade \nvisitors that it was safe to visit, while other areas of the UK continued to suffer with new \noutbreaks of the disease.  Such a scenario led to calls from some sectors of the tourism \nindustry to proceed with advertising campaigns encouraging visitors to the countryside, \nwhile for others, such confidence-building campaigns were misplaced until the problem \nhad universally been removed.   \n \nThe English Tourism Council (ETC) was given \u00a33.8m to promote tourism to a domestic \naudience in April 2001, which was spent on specific market campaigns, coupled with \ndeveloping web sites to inform potential visitors of where was safe to visit.  The ETC \ncalculated that this financial aid generated 766,000 additional visits and produced a return \non investment of \u00a327 for each \u00a31 spent (ETC, 2001c).  In May, a further \u00a312m was given \nto the BTA for international marketing, while no further finance was available for the \nETC and the domestic market (ETC, 2001c). The BTA started planning in September \n2001 to re-brand and re-image Britain through a new \u00a35 million campaign called UK OK \nwhich was implemented in January 2002 to attract the visiting friends and relatives \nmarket. This was targeted at seven selected key markets (USA, Canada, Germany, \nFrance, Belgium, Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland). However, industry \nrepresentatives believed that it was not enough for such a large target audience. Further \nfunding for marketing of Britain overseas was secured in April 2002 with \u00a320m \ncontribution from the government, \u00a35m cash from industry and a further \u00a315m of \n 22 \ncollateral marketing by the campaign partners (BTA, 2002).  This money will be spend \non the \u2018Only in Britain: Only in 2002\u2019 campaign which is expected to attract an extra one \nmillion visitors in 2002 and generate \u00a30.5b for the national economy (BTA, 2002). \n \nAt the local level recovery was undertaken from the intermediate phase of the crisis \nonwards as the area did not have any confirmed cases of the foot and mouth disease. A \npublicity campaign was implemented to attract tourists back to the local area but \nrepresentatives felt that it was difficult to get the interest of the media who were more \ninterested in \u201cmountains of cows in Cumbria (being burned).\u201d The recovery strategy was \nalso limited by budget constraints and a reluctance to put large amounts of money \ntowards a recovery strategy when the disease was not yet defeated at the national level. \nAccording to the District Council this \u201cwould have been a waste of money.\u201d The ETC \nhelped later in the long term recovery stage by providing money for publicity campaigns \nand publicity work was conducted in conjunction with county councils. Recovery was \nquick at the local level under study, partly due to good weather and also because major \ncompetitors such as Cumbria and the South West of England were still battling the \noutbreak throughout the recovery phrase. \n \nConclusion  \nThis paper has outlined the importance of crisis management, and in particular crisis \ncommunication for tourism organisations. Tourism is highly susceptible to external crises \nand disasters, yet even after the foot and mouth outbreak few lessons appear to have been \nlearnt by some parts of the industry. At the national level a greater number of changes \n 23 \nhave been implemented and the BTA are constantly refining their crisis management \nstrategies and plans. The BTA did the best they could under the circumstances, yet the \nnature of the FMD meant that recovery marketing was considered wasteful until after the \noutbreak had been defeated and a lack of a crisis management and communication \nstrategy prior to the outbreak hampered recovery.  \n \nThe absence of a crisis communication or management strategy at the local level was \nevident and yet it appears doubtful if one will be created at all due to the perceived \nuniqueness of individual disasters and crises. Yet as Kash and Darling (1998) and Beeton \n(2001) note all organisations and tourism organisations suffer from external or internal \ncrises of varying magnitudes. In particular, this paper has noted that a lack of crisis \nmanagement strategy combined with a slow response time, inconsistent communication \nstrategies and poor access to information limited the effectiveness of crisis \ncommunication for the tourism industry. In particular, access to information was critical \nfor consumers, industry and local regions. Recovery marketing has been implemented, \nand in the case of the local level recovery was rapid as they appear to have benefited at \nthe expense of other regions. Yet, at the national level recovery marketing is still \ncontinuing and the success of which is yet to be evaluated. The FMD outbreak was \nchaotic as noted by Fink (1986). The fragmentation of the tourism industry did little to \nalleviate this confusion with decisions being made in the heat of the crisis, illustrating the \nneed planning before such incidents occur. \n \n 24 \nGreater research and understanding is required in the field of crisis communication and \ntheory to help improve the understanding of such incidents. This understanding will \nhopefully aid the development of suitable crisis communication models for managers to \nimplement which can be varied depending on the scale and type of crisis or disaster \nencountered. Faulkner\u2019s (2001) model is a useful start, however more research is needed \ninto disaster phenomena and crisis communication in the tourism industry. The cost of \ndeveloping a crisis management strategy would be far less than the cost of not having one \nand a key aspect to any crisis strategy is crisis communication. It is hoped that this paper \nhas contributed in some way to the field of crisis communication in tourism through \nevaluating the FMD outbreak in the UK. \n \nReferences \n \nAlreck, P. & Settle, B.
