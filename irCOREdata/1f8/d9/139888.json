This paper presents\npreliminary results of weld beads produced on thick X100 pipeline carbon-steel plates with an\n8 kW fiber laser. Weld bead geometry was evaluated and transition between conduction and\ndeep penetration welding modes was investigated.\n1. Introduction\nThe methods, processes and procedures for joining need to evolve at least as fast as the\nmaterials and the applications demand. Lasers are playing an important role in the joining of\nmaterials since the invention of high power solid state and gas lasers in 1964, namely, in these\nfirst years, for resistance trimming of electronic circuits till the introduction in the market of a\nreliable high performance laser in the late 70\u2019s, which allowed its application for welding of\nsheet metal parts.\nThe last decade has seen the rise of diode lasers and diode pumped solid state lasers. More\nrecently high power diode pumped fiber lasers were developed. Fiber lasers have been stated\nto be a serious alternative to solid state and carbon dioxide lasers for different materials\nprocessing applications.\nFiber lasers were arisen in the early sixties and used widely at low power levels through out\nthe 80\u2019s and the 90\u2019s as optical amplifiers. In 2000 the first 100 W fiber laser was launched.\nThe first reports on the potential of these lasers in materials processing are very recent \uf05b1\uf05d.\nThe multi-kilowatt range for materials processing with fiber laser is now possible with the\nrecent commercialization of 7 to 10 kW power lasers.\nThese new lasers have multiple advantages, namely: the high efficiency, compared to lamp or\ndiode pumped rod lasers; the compact design, which simplifies its installation; a good beam\nquality, due to the use of thin fibers, and thus small beam focus diameter; a robust setup for\n28-02-2008 2\nmobile applications. The scaling of the laser power is achieved by a modular design\ncomprising several single mode lasers. The lifetime of the pumping diodes exceeds the\nexpected lifetime of other diode pumped lasers, which leads to low costs of ownership.\nThe high power lasers can be used for deep penetration welding in a diversity of materials and\nconstructions as the low wavelength that characterizes these lasers allows its absorption by\nalmost all metals and alloys and the fiber delivery system provides the necessary flexibility on\nthe positioning of the beam. Also high speed welding of sheet metal joints can surpass the\nproductivities achieved with high power CO2 lasers.\nThe present paper presents a preliminary study of the influence of high power fiber laser\nwelding parameters on weld bead geometrical characteristics.\n2. Laser characteristics\nIn a fiber laser, the active medium is the core of the fiber doped with a rare earth. Most\ncommonly, this is a single-mode fiber laser made of silica. The pump beam is launched\nlongitudinally along the fiber length and it may be guided by either the core itself, as occurs\nfor the single-mode lasers or by an inner cladding around this core (double-clad fiber laser) as\nshown in Figure 1.\nFig. 1- Double-clad fiber laser [2]\nIn a fiber laser, a silica \u201cactive\u201d fiber doped with erbium, ytterbium, neodymium or thallium,\nis exited by a diode laser source. Two Bragg gratings, which reflect a predetermined narrow\nor broad range of wavelengths of light incident on the grating, while passing all other\nwavelengths of the light are written into the fiber generating the laser emission and resulting\nin an efficient, compact laser source with high beam quality (figure 2). The incident light in\nthe inner cladding penetrates, being catch in the core, where doping elements, causing a high\nrefraction coefficient, are present. The outer cladding is made of glass or polymeric material,\nwith low refraction coefficient, in order to prevent the signal attenuation.\n28-02-2008 3\nFig. 2 - Fiber laser pumping schematic [3]\nThe high power fiber lasers in the market are based on active fibers and a patented pumping\ntechnique that allows the utilization of broad area multimode diodes rather than diode bars. A\ndevice made from coils of ytterbium-doped multi-clad fiber with an emission wavelength of\n1.07 to 1.08 microns is used. Alternately, it may be thallium doped with a wavelength of 1.8\nto 2.0 microns or erbium doped with a wavelength of 1.54 to 1.56 microns (Figure 3). The\ndiode pumped energy is delivered to the active medium via multimode fibers that are spliced\nto the multi-clad coil. The laser cavity is created directly in the active fiber. The laser\nemission exits the fiber laser through a passive single-mode fiber, typically, with a core\ndiameter of 6 microns \uf05b3\uf05d.\nFig. 3 - Fiber laser spectral ranges. Solid areas represent current output levels and\nshaded areas represent planned output levels [3]\nThe resulting laser beam is essentially diffraction limited and, when outfitted with an integral\ncollimator, produces a beam that is extremely parallel. For example, the 100-watt single-mode\nfiber laser has a full angle divergence of 0.13 milliradians at half angle when collimated to 5\nmm diameter. A 1-kilowatt unit would be made up of 10 individual fiber lasers integrated into\na common cabinet. Although the beam is no longer single-mode, the resulting M2 of 7\u201310 is\nbetter than high-power solid-state lasers. The beam from a 6kW fiber laser can be delivered\nvia a 200 to 300 micron fiber. The ytterbium fiber laser has a wall plug efficiency of 16 to 20\npercent. Erbium and thulium fiber lasers demonstrate lower wall plug efficiency, but they are\nstill more efficient than typical YAG lasers.\n28-02-2008 4\n2.1 Beam Quality\nWhen processing materials with a high power beam laser, the ability to focus the beam is\nabsolutely critical, because good focusability means a smaller spot size and better depth of\nfield. When focusability is good, focusing optics with a longer focal length can be used,\nwhich in turn leads to a large work clearance. The focusability of a laser beam is often\nreferred to as the beam quality.\nDifferent variables are used to describe the beam quality. The beam quality of a CO2 laser is\nusually indicated by the beam propagation factor k, or the beam parameter product (BPP) for\nan Nd:YAG laser. An alternative way to gain synthetic information on the overall beam\nquality relies on the definition of the M2 factor which allows the detection of beam profile\ndeviations from the Gaussian ideal shape.\nThe beam parameter product (BPP) can be defined as follows:\nBPP = \uf061.\uf0770 (eq. 1)\nWith \uf0770 being the radius of the beam waist and \uf061, the divergence angle.\nThe beam quality (M 2) can be expressed by:\n(eq. 2)\nWhere \uf06c is the laser radiation wavelength.\nRelating the beam quality and the beam parameter product:\n(eq. 3)\nConsidering the beam propagation factor (k) in equation 4:\n(eq. 4)\nThen the beam quality can be expressed by equation 5, where:\n(eq. 5)\nThe values are mathematically related and can be compared to each other. The three variables\nare suitable for comparing lasers of the same wavelength. The beam parameter product (BPP),\nis particularly suited for comparing the laser beams focusability, since the influence of the\nwavelength on the focusing diameter is already accounted for in BPP.\nThe quantity M2 is a numerical expression of the beam quality, with 1 being a perfect\nGaussian beam and higher values indicating poorer quality. The usefulness of low-quality\nbeams, M2\u226580 is almost restricted to welding, though laser percussion drilling of holes of a\nfew hundred micrometers in diameter and a few millimetres deep in gas turbine blades\nrequires M2 of about 25 to provide a low taper and a small hole size [4]. High power fiber\nlasers present non Gaussian transverse electromagnetic modes (Fig.4) and thus high M2\nvalues.\n0\n1\nk\n\uf06c\n\uf070 \uf061\uf077\n\uf03d\n2 1M\nk\n\uf03d\n2\n0M\n\uf070\uf061\uf077\n\uf06c\n\uf03d\n2M BPP\n\uf070\n\uf06c\n\uf03d\n28-02-2008 5\nFig. 4 - Profile of a fiber laser emission [5 ]\nWavelengths also provide information about beam quality as, at shorter wavelengths, the\nmore energetic photons can be absorbed by a greater number of bound electrons and so the\nreflectivity falls and the absorption of the surface increases (fig. 5).\nFig. 5 - Absorption of a number of metals as a function of laser\nradiation wavelength \uf05b6\uf05d\nBeam divergence and focal spot size needs to be considered in all applications as these play\nan important role in the quality of the results achieved in laser welding, e.g. small beam\ndivergence and focal spot diameters lead to welds with higher penetration and smaller width\nfor a given welding speed.\n3. Fiber laser benefits\nFiber laser technology offers several benefits to the industrial user. The footprint of a 4 kW\nfiber laser unit is 0.5 m2 versus 11 m2 for a conventional lamp-pumped Nd:YAG, and there is\nno requirement for a chiller, once they are air refrigerated, being the heat dissipated by the\noverall fiber length. The dimensions of 8 kW fiber laser are 1.5 x 0.8 x 1.5 m, approximately.\nThey are essentially maintenance free during their entire lifetime because there is no need to\nreplace flash lamps or diodes. The high electrical efficiency greatly reduces operating costs.\nBetter beam quality, with very low divergence, allows the user to produce spot diameters\n28-02-2008 6\nsubstantially smaller than conventional lasers producing high fluence and\/or longer working\ndistances. A 1 kilowatt laser can be focused to 50 microns spot size with a 100 mm focal\nlength lens. An 8 kW can be focused to a spot size of 0.6 mm with a 250 mm focal length\nlens.\nThe cost for fiber laser technology up to 1 kW output power is below or comparable with\nlamp-pumped YAG lasers. The cost of a fiber laser greater than 1 kilowatt is higher.\nHowever, when all factors are accounted for these lasers, namely, floor space, chillers and\nmaintenance, they should be more cost effective than equivalent power rod-type Nd:YAG\nlasers.\nThese lasers have operated flawlessly on a multiple-shift basis, demonstrating their reliability\nand providing performance data only possible with much larger lasers. A 2 kW unit has been\nlap welding 1.2 mm thick, zinc-coated automotive steel at 5 m\/min. The quality and\nperformance is comparable to a 4 kW lamp-pumped rod type Nd:YAG laser \uf05b3\uf05d. A 2 kW fiber\nlaser, with a 300 micron final fiber diameter, cuts 4 mm-thick coated steel, at a rate of 10\nm\/min, with clean sharp edges. The maximum cutting speed attained is 16 m\/min \uf05b3\uf05d. High\nquality micro-welding is already achieved with single-mode (SM) fiber lasers for stainless\nsteels foils of 10 to 100 \u00b5m, with high speed, using an ultra-fine keyhole welding mode \uf05b7\uf05d.\nPerforation and cutting of natural stone is being performed in USA with high expectations\ngenerated by a study on the potential use of these lasers \uf05b8\uf05d. Miyamoto et al. [9] studied\nstainless steel micro-welding, in specimens from 10 to 100 \uf06dm, with a fiber laser doped with\nytterbium, with a power between 40 and 200 W and a travel speed of 1500 mm\/s, with good\nresults. In the electronic industry, micro-welding and cutting is already performed. For the\nautomobile industry, automated welding, marking and cutting are realised. Aluminium and\ntitanium welds are also performed in the aerospace industry. Marking, cutting and micro-\nwelding are undertaken in medical equipments [10]. The Bremer Institute in Germany (BIAS)\nstudied fiber laser aluminium welding with excellent results for the AA6056 alloy, with 6 mm\nthickness, a power of 6.9 kW and a velocity of 50 mm\/s [11].\n4. Experimental Procedure\nThe high power fiber laser used it was an IPG YLR-8000 equipment with a maximum output\npower of 8 kW, an emission wavelength of 1070 nm, a spot focus diameter of 0.6 mm with a\nfocal length lens of 250 mm and a beam parameter product (BPP) of 16 mm.mrad. The\nsystem comprises a feeding fiber of 200 \uf06dm core diameter and a process fiber with 300 \uf06dm.\nFigure 6 shows a 3D presentation of the beam shape and a single plan view.\nFig. 6 - Laser beam characteristics [12 ]\n28-02-2008 7\nThe experimental set up adopted is shown in figure 7. The process fiber is mounted on a\nFanuc M-710iB\/45T robot via a special device. The robot end-effector holds the laser head\nperpendicular to the workpiece and has the capability of moving in 3D work space.\nFig. 7 - Experimental set-up\nA set of experiments was designed with four levels of laser power (from 2000 to 8000 W) and\nsix levels of travel speed (from 30 to 800 cm\/min). The focal point was kept constant on the\nspecimen surface (f.p.p. = 0 mm). Argon was used as assist gas at a flow rate of 11 l\/min. All\nother processing parameters were kept constant.\nThe base material used for this study was the API X100 low carbon steel, 19 mm thick, for\npipeline applications. Chemical composition and mechanical properties are shown in Tables 1\nand 2. The experimental results were analysed on the basis of the relationships between\nprocess parameters and weld bead shape and dimensions. Melting efficiency was also\nanalyzed. The specimen\u2019s surfaces were prepared and cleaned to assure that all samples\npresented the same surface conditions with an homogeneous finishing.\nC Mn Ni Cu Mo Cr Si V Nb Ti Al\n0.025 1.98 0.48 0.46 0.43 0.42 0.2 0.07 0.05 0.015 0.006\nTable 1 \u2013 X100 steel chemical composition (wt%)\nE [GPa] \uf073c [MPa] \uf073R [MPa]\n210 735 886\nTable 2 \u2013 X100 steel mechanical properties [13]\nAfter welding, specimens were cut from transverse sections at the mid-length position of the\nwelds and the cut surfaces prepared for metallographic inspection by polishing and etching\nusing a 5% nital solution to display bead shape and microstructure. The bead shape\nmeasurements were made using an optical perfilometer with an image analysis system.\n28-02-2008 8\n5.

For higher heat inputs (from 600\nto 1000 J\/mm) the penetration increased significantly and a deep penetration mode was\nobserved [14].\nFiber Laser welding\nBead on X100 Steel Plates\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nHeat Imput [J\/mm]\nD\nep\nth\n[m\nm\n]\nFig. 9 \u2013 Penetration versus heat input for Fiber laser welding\nAnalysing the behaviour of weld beads penetration as a function of laser power and welding\nspeed represented in figures 10 and 11, respectively, it can seen that weld depth follows the\nusual trends observed in laser welding .

If the laser\nbeam is defocused and the heat input is very low, conduction mode welding is the main\nmechanism involved which results in high conduction losses, low penetration achieved and\npoor process efficiency. Typically, conduction weld beads present a semi-spherical geometry\nwith penetration lower then the bead width. If the laser beam irradiates the workpiece with\nhigh energy density (typically \uf03e106 W\/cm2) a keyhole is formed, which enables the laser\nbeam to penetrate deeply and deep penetration mode mechanism becomes predominant,\n28-02-2008 10\nincreasing welding efficiency.

Due to the lack of data available on the\nthermal behaviour of API X100 steel, the properties used where taken from a steel with the\nsame carbon equivalent (Ceq= 0.32) and a similar manganese content.\nK \uf072 cp H\n48.2 W\/mK 7.85x103 Kg\/m3 456 J\/KgK 274 052 J\/Kg\nTable 3 \u2013 X100 steel Thermal Properties [16]\nUsing equation 14, melting efficiency was computed. Figure 12 shows the relationship\nbetween welding speed parameter (vb\/\uf061) and laser power parameter (P\/hKd). When there is a\nfull melting efficiency, these parameters present the same value (y = m.x, with m=1). The\ndashed line was interpolated from the welding data obtained with fiber laser and the\ndetermined slope is about 0.66 which corresponds to an average efficiency of 66 %. A good\nmelting efficiency is attained, when compared with conventional lasers. The energy loss is\nmainly due to conduction losses, which is an important welding mode observed.\nFiber Laser Melting Efficiency\nY = 0,66 X\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\nLaser Power Parameter\n( P\/hKd )\nL\nas\ner\nSp\nee\nd\nP\nar\nam\net\ner\n(v\nb\/\na\n)\nFig. 12 \u2013 Fiber Laser Melting Efficiency\nHeat input and power density are very important parameters to attain full penetration. Several\nauthors consider power density as the main factor for the transition between conduction mode\nand keyhole welding, however, a coupled analysis is needed. In order to relate both\nparameters, beam power was divided by the interaction area, giving the power density, which\nis then divided by the travel speed, giving the energy by volume of interaction (\uf065 - specific\nenergy [J\/mm3]).\nFigure 13 shows the penetration evolution as a function of \u201c\uf065\u201d. It can be noticed a variation in\nthe slope of the dashed line. This corresponds to a transition of welding mode from\nconduction (at low energy values) to deep penetration (above 400 J\/mm3).\nIf the aspect ratio (a.r. - aspect ratio \u2013 bead depth \/ bead width) is considered (figure 14) it can\nbe stated that for low specific energies, \u201da.r.\u201d is lower than 1.5 which means that conduction\nmode was the predominant mechanism. The aspect ratio increases with \u201c\uf065\u201d and for \uf065 \uf03e 400\nJ\/mm3, deep penetration becomes the main welding mode.\n28-02-2008 12\nFrom figures 13 and 14, it can be identified the transient heat input from conduction mode to\nkeyhole welding mode. It is observed that for an heat input above 600 J\/mm and a specific\nenergy of 400 J\/mm3, deep penetration mode becomes predominant, the aspect ratio increases\nsignificantly and the weld bead exhibits a conical geometry instead of the semi-spherical\ngeometry typical for conduction welds mode.\nFiber Laser\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500\nEnergy by interaction volume [J\/mm3]\nD\nep\nth\n[m\nm\n]\nFig. 13 - Penetration as function of specific energy for fiber laser welding of X100 steel\nFiber Laser\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500\nEnergy by interaction volume [J\/mm3]\nA\nsp\nec\ntr\nat\nio\n(d\nep\nth\n\/w\nid\nth\n)\nFig. 14 - Aspect ratio (depth\/width) as function of specific energy for fiber laser\nwelding of X100 steel\n6. Conclusions\nFrom this first set of laser experiments, performed with a recently installed fiber laser of 8\nkW, it is possible to withdraw the following general conclusions:\n\uf0a7 Weld beads present a finger print format with large beads width at the top, due to focal\npoint position placed on the surface.\n\uf0a7 It is possible to identify the transient heat input from conduction mode to keyhole\nmode welding using a coupled analysis between heat input and power density.\n28-02-2008 13\n\uf0a7 A high melting efficiency was observed, when compared with conventional lasers.\nThe energy losses are mainly due to conduction mode welding, which is the main\nmechanism observed near the surface.\nFurther experimentation is being carried out using procedures derived from this first study,\nmainly optimizing the focal point position and shielding gas, in order to limit the bead width\nnear the surface and to achieve higher penetrations and productivity rates.\nReferences\n1.
