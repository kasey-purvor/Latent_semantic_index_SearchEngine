The lifetime risk of ALS is\nabout 1 in 400[1] with peak incidence in the sixth decade but the\ncauses remain largely unknown. In about 10% of cases there is a\nfamily history. Following linkage, mutations causing familial ALS\nhave been identified in the genes SOD1 [2\u20134], TARDBP[5,6], and\nFUS(TLS)[7] accounting for about 20 to 30% of cases, and ALS2\n[8\u201310], SETX[11\u201313], and VAPB[14] accounting for some\natypical, rare forms.\nAttempts to identify genetic causes for the common sporadic\nform of ALS have met with limited success. Candidate gene\nanalyses have identified NEFH deletions and insertions[15\u201317],\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8175\nand ANG mutations[18\u201322] as possible risk factors, and both have\nalso been identified in affected individuals from families with ALS.\nGenome-wide association studies have not found a single\nconsistent risk variant but ITPR2[23], DPP6[24] and\nUNC13A[25] variants have been identified in some studies, and\nKIFAP3 identified as a survival gene[26]. The numbers studied are\nstill in the low thousands and research is therefore continuing.\nCopy number variation of the SMN gene, responsible for spinal\nmuscular atrophy, has been implicated as a risk factor for sporadic\nALS[27]. Two previous studies have examined copy number\ninformation derived from genome-wide association studies of\nALS[28,29] concluding that multiple rare copy number variants\n(CNVs) may be a more important risk factor for sporadic ALS\nthan common CNVs. A study utilising data from a combined total\nof 651 ALS cases and 625 controls, genotyped on either the\nIllumina 300K or the Illumina 550K SNP chip, identified 39 loci\nthat were highlighted as containing rare ALS-specific copy\nnumber changes[28]: plausible candidate regions within this\ncategory included an ataxin gene locus and the hereditary\nhaemochromatosis locus. In the same study and a previous study\nbased on a subset of the same data (406 ALS cases and 404\ncontrols)[29], nominally significant associations between CNVs\nthat were not ALS-specific and risk of ALS were found for a total\nof 25 loci. However, none of these associations remained after\nBonferroni correction for multiple testing.\nSophisticated algorithms are available to mine SNP genotyping\ndata for CNVs[30\u201332]. However, many SNPs in CNV regions\nhave been excluded from some genome-wide genotyping plat-\nforms due to the effect of copy number variation on Hardy-\nWeinberg equilibrium and Mendelian inheritance[33]. Boundary\nuncertainty due to low resolution of the platform can lead to CNV\ncalls that arise from underlying neighbouring or nested, but\ndistinct, CNV events being clustered together across individuals as\nrepresenting the same CNV[33]. The challenge lies in accurately\ncombining calls that may not be identical across individuals but\nwhich arise as the result of the same underlying signal and\ndistinguishing calls that overlap because of boundary uncertainty.\nIn addition, it is known from the study of genomic disorders that\noverlapping or nested CNVs can give rise to distinct phenotypic\ncharacteristics [34\u201336]. Therefore, an approach which combines\nany overlapping CNV calls could lead to misclassification of CNV\nregions. In addition to sample size and genome coverage, the\nmisclassification of CNV regions could explain the thus far weak\nassociations with CNVs found for ALS.\nIn this study, CNV calls derived from Illumina HumanHap 300\nv.1.0 SNP array intensity data from an initial sample size of 730\nALS cases and 789 controls were analysed for association with\nALS. CNV calls were merged into distinct, nested and overlapping\nCNV regions for association analysis. A gene-based association\napproach was also used for comparison and to test the hypothesis\nthat multiple, rare CNVs affecting a subset of genes and pathways\nmay contribute to ALS risk. We compared our findings with those\nof previous studies.\nResults\nGenome-Wide CNV Detection: Raw CNV Calls\nFollowing the sample quality control filters, 621 cases and 675\ncontrols remained for further analysis (age and sex details of the\ncases and controls are given in Table 1). A total of 80023 unfiltered\nCNV calls were made from the data. These calls were filtered\naccording to log Bayes factor (posterior measure of confidence in\nthe call) and proximity to the centromere and CNV calls from\nindividual samples with an extreme number of CNV calls across\ntheir genome were also excluded (see Methods). To facilitate\ncomparison with published findings we did not exclude calls within\nthe telomeric band (but loci containing these calls are flagged\nwhere appropriate in subsequent sections of the results). Following\nthese filters, a total of 11321 CNV calls across 1194 samples (14 of\nwhich contained no CNVs after filtering) remained. The total\nnumber, mean numbers per individual and median sizes of each\ntype of CNV are given in Table 2. A two-tailed Mann Whitney U-\ntest was used to compare the mean number of CNVs per\nindividual and the median size of the CNVs of each type between\ncases and controls. ALS cases were found to contain significantly\nmore duplications (p = 0.0018) and significantly larger duplications\n(p,0.001) than controls.\nGenome-Wide CNV Association: By CNV Region\nCNV calls that passed the filters described above from across all\nindividuals were merged into CNV loci for association testing (see\nMethods). This region-based approach enables consideration of\nboundary estimation uncertainty and the possibility of distinct but\nnested or overlapping CNV loci. A reciprocal overlap threshold of\n.70% was used initially and a total of 2983 CNV loci (median size\n72.9 kb) across the genome were identified. Of these, 119 (median\nsize 90.6 kb) were observed to be ALS-specific (i.e. present in 2 or\nmore ALS cases but not observed in any controls) and 136 (median\nsize 79.1 kb) were observed to be control-specific (i.e. in 2 or more\ncontrol samples but not observed in any cases) (Table 3). There\nwas no significant difference between the number of ALS-specific\nCNV loci and the number of control-specific CNV loci either\noverall or by CNV type (heterozygous deletions, homozygous\ndeletions, duplications, multiallelic [loci consisting of both\nduplications and deletions]). Five loci were found to contain both\nheterozygous and homozygous deletion calls \u2013 all five of these\nCNV regions were identified only in controls and none were found\nin cases (p = 0.03). There was no significant difference between the\nsize distribution of ALS-specific or control specific heterozygous\ndeletions, homozygous deletions or duplications. The control-\nspecific multiallelic loci were found to be significantly larger\n(p = 0.028) than the ALS-specific multiallelic loci (median sizes of\nTable 1.

One hundred and thirty CNV\nloci were observed in more than 1% of samples and 24 were\nidentified in more than 5% of samples.\nOf the 2839 autosomal loci (defined from CNV calls using a\nreciprocal overlap threshold of .70%) tested for association with\nALS, 31 showing gains in copy number were associated with ALS\n(uncorrected nominal p,0.05, Table 4 and Table S1 and Table\nS2). Loci within the telomeric band are flagged and the proximity\nof each loci to the centromeres is indicated in Table 4. Only the\ntop locus on chromosome 5 was associated after Bonferroni\ncorrection for multiple testing. Of these, 26 were found at a\nfrequency of greater than 1% in the study population with 9 of\nthese having a frequency of greater than 5% (although all but one,\nthe RDH13 region, map very close to the centromere: a region\nbelieved to be prone to false positive CNV calls). Eleven of the\nthirty-three \u2018\u2018gains\u2019\u2019 loci overlapped at least one Copy Number\nPolymorphism (CNP), identified by McCarroll and colleagues[37]\nas copy number loci with a frequency of .1% in the HapMap\npopulation. Four CNV loci showing loss of copy number were\nassociated with ALS (nominal p,0.05). Only one of these \u2018\u2018loss\u2019\u2019\nloci was present at a frequency of greater than 1% and this locus\nalso overlapped a CNP. Finally, two further loci showing both\nlosses and gains in copy number across the study population were\nassociated with ALS. One of these two loci was present at a\nfrequency of greater than 1% in the study population and also\noverlapped a CNP.\nSensitivity Analyses\nFor each of the loci defined using a 70% reciprocal overlap that\nreached p,0.05, the raw CNV calls within these regions were re-\nassigned to CNV loci using different reciprocal overlaps (.0%,\n.50% or 100%). Where re-assignment resulted in more than one\nCNV locus within the region defined using 70% overlap, the locus\ngiving the highest significance was included(Table 5). The choice\nof reciprocal overlap threshold used has an effect on the order of\nsignificance of the loci with some loci reaching smaller p values if\ndifferent thresholds are used while others give a higher p value or\nare lost as nominally significant loci. Although the \u2018\u2018top\u2019\u2019 locus on\nchromosome 5 retained a very low p value for all thresholds, the\nsecond and third ranking loci gave p values of.0.01 if any overlap\n(.0%) or a .50% threshold was used. Three loci that achieved a\np value,0.05 when a 70% reciprocal overlap was used were lost if\nany of the other overlap thresholds were used to combine the raw\ncalls.\nGenome-Wide CNV Association: By Gene\nIn addition to the region-based approach described above, a\ngene-based association analysis was also undertaken to accommo-\ndate the hypothesis that multiple rare CNVs may contribute to\nALS risk by affecting one or a subset of key genes. The numbers of\nCNV calls that overlap each gene (at least 1 base pair overlap)\nwere counted and the difference between the number called in\ncases and the number called in controls per gene was tested.\nTable 2.

Twenty-eight of these genes\nwere significantly associated with ALS using a gene-based\napproach at a significance level of p,0.01. The 8 most significant\ngenes were all located within the chromosome 11 region (build 36\ncoordinates \u2013 chr11:539119-652407) which showed ALS-specific\nloss in copy number in 5 samples (this region was also found to\nshow significant association with ALS if different reciprocal\noverlap thresholds were used to merge the data into CNV regions,\nbut with gains in copy number showing association). Figure 1\nshows the raw CNV calls and how these are clustered into CNV\nregions at this locus.\nGene Set and GRAIL Analysis\nGene Set Analysis (GSA) and GRAIL analyses were carried out\non the CNV regions and ALS-specific\/control-specific CNV calls,\nrespectively, to identify any gene-sets that might contain ALS-\nassociated copy number variation. For GSA, no gene-set was\nassociated with ALS using a significance threshold of\np,5.7461024 (Bonferroni corrected). Table S3 shows all\npathways with p,0.05. Four of these nominally significant\npathways are involved in apoptosis and cell death, one in muscle\norgan development (identified using both region-based and gene-\nbased p-values) and one in central nervous system development.\nNo significantly associated genes were identified from the ALS-\nspecific CNV calls using GRAIL but five genes significantly\nassociated with the control-specific CNV calls were identified\n(Table S4).\nCandidate Regions\/Previously Detected Regions\nRegions that were previously identified to show association with\nALS were investigated in our data. ALS-specific gains and losses\nwere observed in 6 ALS cases at the GSDMD gene region\n(association p value = 0.012). This region was also previously\nidentified by Cronin and colleagues[28] as containing ALS-specific\ngains and losses. GSDMD was also found to be significantly\nassociated (p,0.01) with ALS in our gene-based approach. Of the\nother 15 genes identified to exhibit ALS \u2013specific copy number\nvariation by Cronin and colleagues[28] only four were also found\nto exhibit copy number variation in this study but in both cases\nand controls and with no significant differences between them\nusing either approach.\nA region 473.4 kb downstream of SH2D4B region on\nchromosome 10 showed association with ALS by loss of copy\nnumber in this study, using a region-based approach, with 7 ALS\ncases and 22 controls containing a loss at this locus. A significant\nassociation with ALS with losses in 9 ALS cases and 21 controls at\nthe SH2D4B locus was reported by Cronin and colleagues[28].\nThree further loci that were identified as showing significant\nassociation with ALS in this study were also identified as\nsignificantly associated with ALS by Cronin and colleagues[28]:\nthe chromosome 5 locus flanking HCN1, the chromosome 8 locus\nflanking POTE8 and the chromosome 11 locus including OR4A5\nand flanking OR4C12 (this locus was lost from our region-based\napproach upon conversion of genome coordinates to build 36, see\ntable S1). However, the direction of effect was different in this\nstudy with significant differences found between the numbers of\nALS cases and controls with gains of copy number at these loci\n(losses of copy number at these loci were reported in the previous\nstudy).\nDiscussion\nWith a sample size of 1194 (575 ALS cases and 621 controls)\nand genotypes across more than 317,000 SNPs, we set out to\ninvestigate the role of copy number variation in ALS using a\nwidely available CNV calling algorithm. We used two different\napproaches to collate and test association of the raw CNV calls\nwith ALS and compared our results with those of previous studies.\nAlthough none of the loci identified as being associated with ALS\ncontained, or were close to, any genes previously reported as\nplausible ALS candidate genes [38,39], several potential new genes\nTable 5.

The region on chromosome 16\nencompasses several genes that are reasonable candidates for ALS\nsusceptibility. These have functions in calcium signalling (CAC-\nNA1H), axonal transport, (MAPK8IP3), nerve growth factors\n(IGFALS), angiogenesis (BAIAP3), and the ubiquitin proteasome\nsystem (UBE2I, SPSB3). The CPLX1 gene on chromosome 4\nencodes a protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The\nPPP1R13B gene on chromosome 14 is an apoptosis stimulating\nprotein. Perhaps the most interesting potential ALS candidate of the\ngenes identified here is EEF1D, a eukaryotic translation elongation\nfactor 1 delta on chromosome 8, which encodes a subunit of the\nelongation factor-1 complex, responsible for the enzymatic delivery\nof aminoacyl tRNAs to the ribosome. This process has been directly\nimplicated in genetic studies of motor neuron diseases\n(GARS[40,41], YARS[42] and IARS[43] genes), and the RNA\nprocessing pathway in general is involved in amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis as evidenced by ALS-linked mutations identified in the\nSETX, FUS and TARDBP genes[5\u20137,11\u201313], and the association of\nALS with variants in the ANG[18\u201322] and ELP3[44] genes.\nAlthough we found few differences between the numbers and\nsizes of ALS-specific and control-specific regions overall, we\nidentified 5 regions that were ALS-specific and achieved\nsignificance (before multiple testing correction). Many of the genes\nin these regions were also associated when the raw CNV calls were\ntested using a gene-based approach, including EEF1D and\nPPP1R13B. Although we found the copy number variation at a\nchromosome 11 region to be ALS-specific in our sample\npopulation, CNVs at this locus in healthy individuals have been\nrecorded previously [45] and are recorded in the Database of\nGenomic Variants[46] suggesting that this region may not be\nALS-specific.\nThere was a small amount of overlap between the results from this\nstudy and those of a previous study investigating the role of CNV in\nALS risk but the majority of the findings of the previous study were\nnot replicated in our data. Cronin et al[28] found a significant\ndifference between the median size of heterozygous deletions in cases\nand controls. In this study, the median size of heterozygous deletions\nwas larger in cases compared to controls but this difference was not\nfound to be significant. When our data was filtered using an\nalternative set of filters that were closer to those implemented by\nCronin et al[28] (see Appendix S1), the size of heterozygous deletions\nwere found to be larger in cases than in controls but the difference\ndid not reach significance (p,0.05). Significant (P,0.01) differences\nbetween the mean number per individual and the median size of\nduplications were found between cases and controls using both our\noriginal filters and those similar to Cronin et al[28].\nOur primary analysis was undertaken using a region-based\napproach which aimed to reduce the impact of errors in boundary\nTable 6.

Four different reciprocal overlap thresholds were\napplied to the data to merge CNV calls into CNV regions and, of\nthe 38 loci showing association with ALS if a .70% reciprocal\noverlap was used, all but 3 regions were also associated with ALS\n(nominal P,0.05) if a different reciprocal overlap threshold was\nused (i.e. any overlap, .50% overlap and 100% overlap).\nHowever, the level of significance achieved varied for most\nregions according to the overlap threshold used; if validation were\nto be undertaken for a limited number of regions, the choice of\nsuch regions would be dependent on the choice of reciprocal\noverlap threshold used. Interestingly, many of the regions\nidentified using the region-based approach, were also represented\namongst the hits from the gene-based analysis. The potentially\ninteresting genes within the chromosome 16 region and CPLX1\nwere not significantly associated with ALS under the gene-based\napproach. However, EEF1D and PPP1R13B were significantly\nassociated with ALS using both approaches.\nNo evidence of any gene set being overrepresented amongst\nthose affected by ALS-specific copy number variation was found\nby GRAIL analysis. There were five significant genes amongst\nthose affected by control-specific copy number variation, identified\nby GRAIL analysis, including GLL1 which is involved in B cell\nbiology and has been associated with agammaglobulinemia[47].\nNo significantly associated gene-sets were identified using GSA\nalthough several involving cell death, muscle organ development\nand central nervous system development were amongst those\nshowing nominal significance (uncorrected p,0.05). If a result that\nis significant in a CNV genome-wide association study is not\nsignificant in GSA it might still be important if it perturbs a\npathway. For example, a deletion upstream of the IRGM gene\naffects the expression of IRGM but the gene itself is not believed to\nbe copy number variable [48]. In this case GSA using CNV\nassociation data would not report the IRGM-related pathways.\nPrevious studies have found limited evidence for a role of CNV\nin sporadic ALS hypothesising that multiple rare variants are more\nlikely to contribute to risk than common variants. In this study,\nalthough nine copy number variable regions found in more than\n5% of the study population showed association with ALS, seven of\nthese were found to map close to the centromeres and may be\nartefactual. In addition, the regions on chromosomes 4, 8, 14 and\n16 which are reported here as being associated with ALS and\ncontaining potential ALS candidates all lie within the telomeric\nchromosome band and so must also be treated with caution. The\ntelomeric and centromeric regions may be more prone to false\nCNV calls than other regions of the genome, in part due to the\nlower density coverage of older genotyping arrays in these regions.\nFindings based on newer generation SNP arrays (which also\ninclude non-SNP copy number variation probes) have shown\nstrong evidence of common CNVs in these regions [37] suggesting\nthat there may be true copy number variants in these regions\nalthough caution must be taken when studying these regions on\nolder platforms. The gene-based approach also reported genes\nfrom within some of the region-based approach findings, including\nthe regions on chromosomes 8 and 14 which contain potential\nALS candidate genes. The chromosome 11 region at which ALS-\nspecific copy number variation was observed was reported using\nboth approaches (with p,0.01 for each gene using gene based\napproach and p= 0.025 using region-based approach, although\nthis region also lies within 1.5 Mb of the telomere and therefore\nmust be treated with caution). Evidence of association in regions\nfor which copy number variation has previously been charac-\nterised by McCarroll and colleagues [37] suggests that a role of\ncommon copy number variation in ALS risk should not be ruled\nout. It should be noted that the HumanHap300 chip has low (or\nno) coverage of regions known to contain common copy number\nvariants and further studies involving larger sample sizes and using\ndenser SNP arrays or SNP-CNV hybrid arrays should be\nundertaken to further investigate the role of CNV in ALS and\nprovide replication of the findings presented here.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nThis study was conducted according to the principles expressed\nin the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Massachusetts General Hospital. All\npatients provided written informed consent for the collection of\nsamples and subsequent analysis.\nParticipants\nStudy participants were individuals of European ancestry\nattending the ALS Clinic of the Massachusetts General Hospital,\nBoston, MA, USA. All cases fulfilled the El Escorial criteria for\nDefinite or Probable ALS. Controls were spouses or others\nattending with the patient (all unrelated), or blood donors from the\nsame geographical region and matched for age. Patients with a\nfamily history of ALS were excluded.\nDNA was extracted from whole blood using standard methods\nafter written informed consent. Genotyping was performed with\nIllumina BeadArrays at the Broad Institute in Boston (Human-\nHap300 v.1.0).\nCNV Calling\nLog R ratios and B allele frequencies for 1519 samples,\nincluding 730 ALS cases and 789 control samples, across all\nFigure 1.

QuantiSNP [32] was\nused to screen the genotyping data for CNVs. One sample failed to\nrun due to at least 26,000 missing SNPs and was excluded. All\nremaining samples were filtered for quality using thresholds of the\nlog R Ratio (LRR) and B allele frequency (BAF) outlier rates and\nstandard deviations recommended by the program authors[32].\nSamples with LRR or BAF outlier rates of .0.05 or with log R\nratio or B allele frequency standard deviations of .0.35 or .0.1,\nrespectively, following GC correction were excluded (Figure 2).\nFollowing these sample quality control filters, 621 cases and 675\ncontrols remained. A total of 80023 unfiltered CNV calls were\nmade from the data.\nFiltering CNV Calls\nIn order to minimise the number of false positive CNV calls\nwithout compromising the sensitivity of detection of true CNVs,\nwe undertook simulations to define appropriate filtering thresholds\n(see Appendix S1 and Figure S1). QuantiSNP provides a log Bayes\nfactor (LBF) value for each CNV call, which is a posterior measure\nof confidence in the call. From the simulations, a log Bayes factor\nthreshold of 6 was chosen (figure S1). A total of 60596 calls were\nfound to have a log Bayes factor of less than 6 and were excluded.\nAlthough it was found that there was very low sensitivity for\ndetecting small CNVs, no length filters were chosen as filtering on\nlength was found to decrease the sensitivity of the method to detect\nlonger CNVs.\nAny calls that overlapped the centromeres (coordinates obtained\nfrom the relevant version of the UCSC genome browser database)\nwere excluded (625 out of 19427). As a major aim of our study was\nto enable independent comparison with previously published loci,\nwe did not exclude CNV calls which were within the telomeric\nchromosome band. Samples that were outliers in terms of the\nnumber of CNV calls across their genome were excluded along\nwith their calls (7481 out of 18802 calls and 102 samples). The\nthreshold for this was calculated using the upper quartile+1.5x(-\nIQR) [28,29].\nDefining CNV Regions\nCNV calls were clustered into CNV loci using a reciprocal\noverlap threshold (Figure 3). A threshold of .70% (pairs of CNV\ncalls being compared must each be over at least 70% of the other\nCNV) was chosen. Thresholds of .0% (i.e. any overlap), .50%\nand 100% were also tested (sensitivity anal ysis) to investigate the\neffect this has on the association testing results under the rationale\nthat combining CNV calls must also take into account the\nbiological phenomenon of nested or overlapping CNVs along with\nthe uncertainty of boundary estimation by the method used.\nFigure 2. Sample quality measures (log R ratio and B allele frequency outlier rates and standard deviations). Maximum LRR standard\ndeviation against maximum BAF standard deviation (top) and maximum LRR outlier rate against maximum BAF outlier rate (bottom). Thresholds for\nexclusion are shown in red.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0008175.g002\nCopy Number Variation in ALS\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8175\nCNV calls were first sorted by length (number of SNPs). The\nlargest CNV call was assigned the initial CNV locus identifier.\nEach subsequent CNV call was then compared to all CNV calls\npreviously assigned to a CNV locus and was in turn allocated to\nthe CNV locus for which it showed a reciprocal overlap of greater\nthan the chosen threshold with all CNV calls already allocated to\nthat locus. If it did not meet the overlap criteria for all CNV calls\ncurrently assigned to any of the previously designated CNV loci, it\nwas assigned to a new CNV locus. This allows nested CNV loci to\nbe designated and prevents CNV loci from \u2018\u2018spreading\u2019\u2019 such that\nthey contain CNV calls that do not overlap one another.\nDefining Gene Overlap for Gene-Based Association\nThe coordinates of all 11321 CNV calls that passed the filters\nabove were mapped from Build 35 to Build 36 of the human\ngenome (Batch Coordinate Conversion tool, UCSC Genome\nBioinformatics Group) in order to extract the number of calls that\noverlapped each gene (Table Browser tool, UCSC Genome\nBioinformatics group). A total of 101 unique CNV call locations,\ncomprising 1197 individual CNV calls (1167 copy number gain\ncalls, 30 copy number loss calls), were not mapped to the new\nbuild as the sequence they represented from build35 was either\npartially deleted or split across more than region in build 36.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test (1 degree of freedom) was used\nfor comparison of the number of ALS-specific and the number of\ncontrol-specific CNV loci. A two-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test was used\nto test each autosomal CNV locus for differences between cases\nand controls \u2013 losses and gains at a single locus were considered\ntogether. A two-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test was also used for gene-\nbased association testing with losses and gains considered both\nseparately and together. Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for\ncomparison of CNV size and mean number per individual\nbetween cases and controls. No multiple testing corrections were\napplied. A significance threshold of P,0.05 was used.\nPathway Analysis\nGene Set analysis. Gene Set analysis (GSA) was undertaken\nusing the GenGen package [49] which implements the Gene-Set\nEnrichment Analysis introduced by Subramanian, Tamayo et al\n[50]. Significance was estimated empirically by permutation of the\nphenotype labels (1000 permutations). All genes from Ensembl v54\n(www.ensembl.org) that were overlapped by CNV regions defined\nusing a 70% reciprocal overlap threshold (plus 20 kb upstream\nand downstream) were included in the analysis and the association\np-value from the overlapping CNV region was assigned to the\ngene. We extended the coordinates by 20 kb as per Veyrieras et al.\n(2008) who showed that approximately 95% of common SNPs\nlikely to affect gene expression reside in the proximal 20 kb to the\ntranscription start and end sites [51]. A total of 115 KEGG and\nGene Ontology level 4 gene sets containing between 20 and 200\ngenes were tested. Since many gene sets are redundant, the\neffective number of pathways was calculated using an approach\npreviously proposed to calculate the effective number of tests for\ngenotype data [52]. A total of 87 effective pathways were tested\nwith a threshold of 5.74610-4 defined by Bonferroni correction for\nsignificance.\nThis analysis was also carried out using p-values from the gene-\nbased association testing. A total of 105 pathways that included 97\neffective pathways was tested and a threshold for significance of\n5.1561024 was defined.\nGRAIL. A GRAIL analysis [53] was carried out on ALS-\nspecific (n = 119) and control-specific (n = 136) CNV calls\nFigure 3. Clustering CNV calls into CNV loci based on a\nreciprocal overlap threshold of 50%. Each coloured bar represents\none CNV call in a single individual (note: the method used here cannot\ndistinguish overlapping calls in the same individual). CNV loci are\ndefined by vertical dashed lines. CNV locus 1 shows three CNV calls that\neach share a greater than 50% reciprocal overlap with each of the other\nCNV calls at that locus. Overlapping CNV loci 2 and 3 result from three\noverlapping CNV calls, of which only two share a reciprocal overlap of\ngreater than 50%. CNV locus 4 and CNV locus 5 are an example of how\nnested CNVs can occur.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0008175.g003\nCopy Number Variation in ALS\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8175\nindependently. The seed regions (regions to be tested) were set the\nsame as the query region (in this case the CNV call coordinates)\ndue to the absence of any previously identified CNV regions\nstrongly associated with ALS. In brief, for each gene overlapped\nby a query region all other human genes are given a relatedness\nranking using a similarity measure calculated by text mining of\nPubMed abstracts. A count of all genes within all seed regions that\nhave a relatedness ranking less than a given threshold (which is\ndependent on the number of genes within the seed region) for the\ncandidate gene is then obtained and a p value for the count\ncalculated. The best scoring gene within each query region is then\nidentified using the p value corrected for multiple testing according\nto the number of candidate genes within the query region and any\ngenes that reach significance (p,0.05) are reported. The reported\ngenes are the genes with the most number of relationships to other\ngenes in independent associated regions.\nSupporting Information\nAppendix S1 Supplementary Methods: Simulations to define\nfiltering thresholds and alternative CNV call filtering strategy for\ncomparison with previous study.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0008175.s001 (0.03 MB\nDOC)\nTable S1 CNV regions showing significant association with ALS\nbut coordinates not transferable to build 36.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0008175.s002 (0.03 MB\nDOC)\nTable S2 Summary of all association results (p,0.05 using\nFishers exact test).\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0008175.s003 (0.07 MB\nDOC)\nTable S3 Pathways nominally associated with ALS (P,0.05)\nusing GSA analysis.
