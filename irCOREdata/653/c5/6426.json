ISBN: 0-7494-3397-3. Hardback, viii+271\npages, \u00a340.00.\nThe theme of this year's International Simulation\nand Gaming Yearbook - 'Transition and Change'\n- addresses the topical discourse on the\nimprovement of pedagogy by the introduction of\nactive and student-centred learning in UK\nhigher education. Although the value of\n'learning-by-doing' and experiential learning is\nwell recognized by researchers in education,\nmany subjects and university courses continue to\nemploy teaching methods (such as lectures) that\nfavour a passive reproduction of information\nrather than the fostering of student\nunderstanding. In this regard, simulations and\ngames are powerful tools that not only promote\nan active, student-centred approach to learning\nbut have the potential to help realize government\npolicies to improve the quality of teaching and\nlearning in higher education institutions in the\nUK.\nGames and simulations, in fact, are becoming a\nsteadfast methodology in certain subjects as well\nas in professional training. This eighth volume\nof a series on simulation and gaming research is\nvital proof of the persistent development and\nuse of the methodology by dedicated teachers\nand trainers. The publication consists of a\ncompilation of papers from well-known scholars\nand practitioners. Theoretical topics are amply\n76\ncomplemented with descriptions of use and\nimplementations of simulations and games in a\nvariety of international educational settings.\nContributions are grouped thematically into\nsections on 'Game Design and Development'\n(1), 'Interpersonal Relations' (2), 'Business and\nManagement' (3), 'Technology and Computing'\n(4), 'Practitioner's Notes' (5) and 'Yearbook\nInformation' (6).\nThe book's overall structure follows a sequence\nthat caters to readers who are unfamiliar with\nthe topic area. The first section with\ntheoretically orientated papers provides an\nintroduction into current research and thought\nthat places the application examples from the\nfollowing sections in context. While most\nauthors are enthusiastic about games and\nsimulations, critical pieces are also included so\nthat overall a very balanced view of the\nmethodology is provided. The article by Henry\nEllington, for example, reviews eloquently the\ncategories and key characteristics of games and\nsimulations in respect to pedagogy. Depending\non the context, games, simulations and case\nstudies can be used to develop communication,\ninterpersonal, research, analysis and cognitive\nskills. Moreover, with an increasing trend toward\ncomputer-mediated self-study, online and\ndistance learning, the need to balance student-\ncentred learning with interactive and face-to-\nface learning opportunities is stressed. While\ngames possess many strengths, such as the\npotential to integrate perspectives from different\ndisciplines and to promote deep learning, the\nAk-J Volume 9 Number 2\nauthor points also to weaknesses, such as the\norganizational challenges of accommodating\ngames in a university schedule, the difficulties for\nassessment and the potential misuse of games as\ndiversions. Further papers in this section discuss\nsimulation design, the implications of the\nemotional element in role-play and the use of\nsimulations to develop and assess policy in\nhealth care.\nReaders familiar with the field will not be\ndisappointed. Topical sections support a\nselective reading approach focusing on specific\nissues and applications. Contributions cover a\nwide spectrum ranging, for example, from a\nplayful imaginary classroom exercise on the\ndiffusion of innovation and a training workshop\nfor professionals in the catering industry to an\ninteresting simulation on interpersonal relations\nwhich is designed to help participants gain an\nunderstanding of prejudice and discrimination.\nHere, real world discrimination is 'rehearsed' in\nthe simulation through deliberate segregation\nand information-channelling. The artificially\ncreated difference in information access and level\nleads to mistrust and prejudices in the\ninteractions of the reunited group which are\ndiscussed in a structured manner at the con-\nclusion of the exercise. Much deeper under-\nstanding is achieved through this experiential\napproach than could be obtained through\ndiscussion alone.\nThe final part, 'Yearbook Information', contains\nthe most comprehensive and well-organized\nreference section on gaming and simulation\nwork of which I am aware. A bibliography of\nrecent articles categorized by major disciplines\nprovides readers easy access to additional\ninformation and research on many different\naspects of gaming and simulations. There is also\nan up-to-date list of national and international\npublications, such as books and journals as well\nas addresses of companies that design and\ndistribute games.\nThe Simulation and Gaming Research Yearbook\ndazzles with a great breadth of contributions\nfrom many fields and countries. However, depth\nand quality of individual articles vary. A number\nof essays from Section 5, entitled 'Practitioner's\nNotes', are rather sketchy and eclectic. A lengthy\ndescription of a game design competition may\nhave great entertainment value to the\ncontributor's friends and acquaintances, but it is\nlikely to be a cause for bewilderment for many\nothers. On one hand, one may argue that more\nrigorous editorship might have helped to\nalleviate quality discrepancies, but the trade-off\nwould almost certainly be less diversity in terms\nof authors and topics. This is a difficult choice to\nmake, for there is a delicate balance between\ninclusion, breadth and diversity and inconsist-\nency, lack of quality and eclecticism. On the\nother hand, a rigorous scholarly evaluation may\nbe uncalled for here. In the preface of the fourth\nGaming and Simulation Yearbook, Saunders\nasserted that reading passively about active\nlearning is somewhat a contradiction of terms.\nGames and simulations need to be experienced\nto evaluate their real quality.\nNonetheless, for lack of alternative media, the\nSimulation and Gaming Yearbook series is, so far\none of the best accounts of activities and\nresearch in the field of gaming and simulation\navailable. This edition on Transition and Change\ncomplements earlier volumes with new and\nunique contributions that re-emphasize the\nwealth of possibilities for the use of games and\nsimulations in different fields. This book, I\nbelieve, will proof useful for teachers and\neducators seeking to improve the learning\nexperience of their students as the collection of\ntheory, concepts, and practical examples\nprovides an abundance of ideas and tools for use\nin various teaching and training situations.\nAndrea Frank\nCardiff University\nDavid McConnell, Implementing Computer\nSupported Cooperative Learning, 2nd edition,\nLondon: Kogan Page, 2000. ISBN: 0-7494-\n3135-0. Hardback, 264 pages, \u00a319.99.\nIn the six years since the first edition of this\nbook was published much has changed. In 1994\nthe Web was in its infancy and much of the\neducational use of computer-mediated commu-\nnications (CMC) was of a pioneering or experi-\nmental nature. The use of CMC is not yet a\nmainstream activity but it is certainly common-\nplace. The world of text-based systems has been\nenriched by newer Web-based systems and the\nprospect of full multimedia is now much closer\nas processing power and bandwidth are\nincreasing rapidly. This book is not primarily\nabout technology; it is aimed squarely at\npractitioners who are interested in co-operative\nlearning and as such the pedagogical basis of the\nbook is much more stable than technological\nchange might imply. This book remains a\nvaluable contribution because it is about the\n77\nReviews\nimplementation of a pedagogical practice using\ntechnology rather than being simply technology-\ndriven.\nThe author describes the book as being divided\ninto three sections. Part I examines co-operative\nlearning and the technologies available for\nsupporting co-operative learning. It then goes on\nto draw comparisons between computer\nsupported co-operative learning (CSCL) and\nface-to-face environments. Part II (Chapters 5\nand 6) considers design issues and presents a\ncase study of a long-running CSCL programme.\nIn Part III (Chapters 7 and 8) the author\nconcludes the book with a review of advanced\nlearning technologies that can be applied to\nCSCL and an examination of research into\nCSCL. I have provided the indications as to\nwhich chapters fall into each section as the book\nhas no guide to the sections that the author\ndescribes.\nChapter 1 of the book introduces the idea of co-\noperative learning. This chapter is the heart of\nthe book, as it sets out the pedagogic framework\naround which the other chapters develop. It is\nupdated by the inclusion of an additional\nsection about socially orientated theories of\nlearning that have become increasingly\nsignificant in the years between the two editions\nof this book. The chapter acknowledges the\nvarious uses of the terms 'collaborative' and 'co-\noperative' within the field of CSCL.and wisely\ndecides to use co-operative as an inclusive term\nto encompass the various approaches to the\nsubject. The use of the term co-operative allows\nthe author to draw support from the wider social\ntheories of co-operation associated with Axelrod\nand Argyle.\nChapter 2 deals with technologies for CSCL and\nis one of the parts of the book most affected by\nrecent developments. The chapter outlines some\nof the currently available software systems for\nCSCL in a more fully developed section than\nthe first edition. These are divided into\nasynchronous and synchronous types, with\nthe author expressing a clear preference for\nsystems that support knowledge construction\nrather than systems with an underlying purpose\nof instructional delivery. The system reviews are\nquite comprehensive and they are informed by\nrecent research at the University of Sheffield.\nOther sections of the chapter are not so\nthoroughly updated. In particular the structure\nremains much the same as the 1994 edition,\nthough some of the technical specifications have\n78\nbeen removed, as they are now out of date. The\nproblem with this chapter is that it does not look\nclosely at current technical developments and\ntheir potential for educational applications.\nTelecommunication companies are now\nsupplying digital subscriber lines (DSL): BT for\nexample currently offers ADSL (Asymmetrical\nDSL) in some regions and has plans to make the\ntechnology available across the UK. The\ncapacity and possible uses of ADSL and DSL\nlines in general are not mentioned. Mobile Web\naccess is now available via WAP telephones, and\nthird-generation mobile technologies that will\noffer permanent connections and high data rates\nare on the horizon. Some discussion of the\naffordances of these new systems would have\nbeen welcome, as audio and video capabilities\nmay become widely available in the near future.\nChapter 3 examines tutoring and learning in\nCSCL and face-to-face environments. In\nstructure and content it remains largely the same\nas the first edition. An entirely new chapter that\nconsiders the dynamics of group work follows.\nThe focus of this chapter is aspects of gender\nand the differences observed between male and\nfemale participants in CSCL. It is based upon\nempirical research undertaken by the author in\nthe early 1990s.\nThe second section consists of two chapters,\n'Designing for CSCL' and 'CSCL in Action - A\nCase Study'. Chapter 5 is a helpful chapter\ndealing with design issues and it has\ncomprehensively updated references in the new\nedition. It also contains a short additional\nsection that develops the socially orientated\ntheories of learning introduced in Chapter 1 by\nconsidering recent developments in the study of\nlearning communities. The structure of this\nchapter and the one following remains largely\nthe same as in the first edition. Chapter 6 draws\non further empirical research by the author to\nprovide a detailed case study. The final section of\nthe book consists of two chapters, Chapter 7\n(Trends and Developments') and Chapter 8\n('Researching CSCL'). Both chapters have been\nupdated and Chapter 7 is a complete reworking\nof the equivalent chapter in the first edition.\nOverall this remains a valuable book. If you have\nnot either read or bought a copy of the first\nedition, I recommend that you do not miss the\nrevised second edition. If you have a copy of the\nfirst edition, I cannot in all honesty recommend\nthat you purchase the new edition, as it remains\nlargely the same book. You may wish to read a\nAlt-J Volume 9 Number 2\ncopy of the new edition, though the book\ncontains little new material beyond revisions and\nthe new Chapter 4 looking at Group Dynamics.\nSpecifically the revisions made in the area of\ntechnology and of advanced learning\ntechnologies are not sufficient to warrant an\nunqualified recommendation.\nChris Jones\nLancaster University\nLinda Lau, Distance Learning Technologies:\nIssues, Trends and Opportunities, Hershey PA\n(USA): Ideas Group Publishing, 2000.

Softback, ii+252 pages, $69.50\nUS.\nWith the growing attention being paid to the use\nof distance learning technology in education,\nthis book is intended to promote and enhance\nknowledge and understanding of distance learn-\ning technologies for academics and practitioners.\nA collection of papers presented in sixteen\nchapters, the book deals with a diverse range of\ndistance learning situations from a Web-based\nlearning environment for children, through\ninstruction systems for higher education to Web-\nbased training for the network marketing\nindustry. It is divided into three sections. The\nfirst concentrates on the theoretical foundations\nof distance learning. The second section\ndescribes the conceptual aspects of distance\nlearning - strategies for using distance learning\ntechnologies and elements to consider for\nsuccessful development of distance learning\nprograms. The final section presents case studies\nof practical implementation of distance learning\ntechnology.\nThe first four chapters focus on the theoretical\naspects of distance learning. Chapter One\nprovides reasonable coverage of constructivist\nlearning theories and examples of constructivist\napproaches, but recommendations for imple-\nmenting these theories in Web-based learning\nenvironments are brief and rather superficial\nand do not offer any real proposals. The second\nchapter provides sound advice but again does\nnot fully cover the area. For instance, it acknow-\nledges that text-based learning can produce\n'lurkers', but the authors fail to address the\nproblem of how to ensure discourse takes place.\nChapter Three discusses a framework for\nsummative and formative evaluation of Web-\nbased teaching in higher education. The authors\nsuggest that formative evaluation should justify\nthe use of the teaching method; while in a\nformative evaluation one should analyse the\nneeds of the student users and design an\nappropriate system to meet those needs. Chapter\nFour considers the implications of distance\ntraining programs in large businesses. It argues\nthat a change in the way training is carried out\nrequires a combined approach of strategic\nplanning, change management and project\nmanagement. This article argues that these skills\nshould be utilized to ensure the smooth\ntransition within a corporate structure to\ntechnology-based distance learning. While\nacknowledging the different focus of higher\neducation and business, the author argues that\nboth business and higher education can draw on\nthe principles of strategy, change management\nand project planning to implement distance\neducation.\nThe middle chapters of the book describe con-\nceptual aspects of distance learning technology.\nChapter Six identifies and discusses the issues\nthat need to be addressed by an institution when\nconsidering forming an alliance to provide\ndistance learning. It highlights both the\npotential benefits and pitfalls and identifies the\nneed for longitudinal research into the way such\nalliances evolve and the way they might affect\nthe mission, identity and survival of an\nindividual school. Chapter Seven presents a case\nstudy of DODEA Electronic School which was\nset up as a distance learning institution, and has\nmoved to IT-based delivery. The school uses\nLotus Notes and this chapter examines what the\nauthors regard to be the key elements of a\nsuccessful distance learning program. The nine\ncriteria appear to be a useful set of elements,\nthough some are only possible in a particular\ntype of learning environment. They may not be\nappropriate for some distance learning commu-\nnities where students are, for instance, based at\nhome. This is an enthusiastic and upbeat chapter\ndesigned to assist the instructional designer in\ndeveloping existing courses, although it does\ntend to gloss over some of the difficulties and\ndrawbacks of designing such an environment.\nOnline education from the perspective of the\ncourse developer is considered in Chapter Eight.\nIt identifies and discusses three issues the author\nconsiders essential for the successful design and\nimplementation of an online course: first,\npedagogical concerns - the instructional and\npedagogical goals of the course for the students;\nsecondly, organizational issues - the extent of\nonline delivery, type of assignment, group size,\ntypes of interaction, prerequisite skills; thirdly,\n79\nReviews\ninstitutional issues - support for staff and\ninnovative practices, credit for online courses\nand student evaluation of courses.\nTwo of the five chapters (Chapters 12 and 15) in\nthe final section highlight the potential for\ngreater isolation in online learning as opposed to\ntraditional face-to-face education. They discuss\nthe approaches they have taken to address and\navoid this problem. Chapter Twelve discusses the\nexperience of setting out specifically to create a\n'community of learning' in a programme that is\n60 per cent face-to-face and 40 per cent online\n(though students tend to spend much more time\n- u p to 80 per cent - online). Chapter Fourteen\nexamines Web-based instruction systems (WBIS)\nfrom the systems perspective, presenting critical\nissues and problems relating to WBIS. It\npresents a taxonomy for classifying current types\nof WBIS, and suggests how the taxonomy can be\nused to evaluate and select appropriate techno-\nlogies to develop WBIS. The chapter ends by\nassessing the impact of current technological\nand socio-economic trends on the future of\nWBIS. For me, this was one of the most\ninteresting and forward-looking chapters of the\nbook.\nM y main criticism of this book is that it would\nhave benefited from closer proof-reading and a\nmore narrowly defined focus. The papers might,\nhowever, be useful resource material for students\nundertaking a study of the area. There are\nexceptions to this - particularly in the final\nsection of the book - where the papers offer\ncontent of substance to the academic or\nresearcher.\nElaine Pearson\nUniversity of Teesside\nChris Morgan and Meg O'Reilly, Assessing Open\nand Distance Learners, London: Kogan Page,\n1999. ISBN: 0-7494-2878-3. Softback, x+227\npages, \u00a319.99.\nThis volume is one in the 'Open and Distance\nLearning Series' published by Kogan Page.\nAssessment is a controversial issue in any\ncontext and in open and distance learning\n(ODL) there are many additional considerations\nwhich Morgan and O'Reilly identify and\naddress.\nThe book is divided into three parts. Part A\n(Chapters 1 to 4) deals with 'Issues and themes\nin open and distance assessment', Part B\n(Chapters 5 to 11) covers 'Assessing learners in\n80\nopen and distance learning', while Part C is\ndevoted to 'Case studies'. The authors suggest\nthat readers may like to read sequentially or dip\ninto sections of interest or need. For the\npurposes of this review I read sequentially but\nthe layout of the book with its clear headings\nand subheadings, a full contents section and a\ncomprehensive index facilitates serendipitous\ndipping.\nThe first two chapters of Part A provide a\nconsideration of the positive and negative\naspects of assessment and the purposes of\nassessment in general.\nIn Chapter 3 the focus of the discussion is\nassessment in an open learning context. A\nvignette describes how one distance learner took\na strategic or pragmatic approach to her studies\nby focusing entirely on the assessment require-\nments and almost completely bypassing the\ncarefully prepared study materials. This raises\nimportant questions about how effectively study\nmaterials support assessment and are linked to\nthe objectives of the course. This is not only a\nproblem in distance learning; we are all familiar\nwith students in face-to-face contexts who\nappear to engage minimally with our carefully\nprepared sessions and whose only questions are\nabout the assessment requirements!\nThe authors engage us in interesting debate as to\nwhether or not open learning really is as open\nand student-centred as its proponents assume. In\nrelation to assessment they highlight students'\nconcerns about lack of choice or variety in\nassessment methods, minimal opportunities for\nstudent self-assessment and inscrutable marking\nschemes. There are similar issues raised by tutors\nconcerning standards and consistency, plagiar-\nism and proof of authorship and the additional\ntime that individualized learning activities\nrequire for marking. Further discussion leads to\nthe identification of the key qualities required\nfor open and distance assessments. It would be\ndifficult to argue with this list:\n\u2022 a clear rationale and consistent pedagogical\napproach;\n\u2022 explicit values, aims, criteria and standards;\n\u2022 authentic and holistic tasks;\n\u2022 a facilitative degree of structure;\n\u2022 sufficient and timely formative assessment;\n\u2022 awareness of the learning context and\nperceptions.\nAlt-J Volume 9 Number 2\nIn Chapter 4 the use of online technologies in\nopen and distance assessment is considered.\nFrom the premise that, so far, most ODL assess-\nment activities have remained rather static, the\nauthors discuss the opportunities and losses that\nonline learning and assessment present. They\nalso suggest that we need to be aware of the\npotential trap of harnessing new technologies as\na medium for presenting old assessment\nmethodologies.\nPart B ('Assessing learners in open and distance\nlearning') covers the design and communication\nof assessment tasks, marking and grading,\ncreating dialogue through assessment, time\nmanagement, the development of assessment\npolicies and evaluation. For me this is the most\nvaluable section of the book. The authors\nrequest that readers read the materials critically\nrather than considering them as recipes for\npractice; they also hope that the information\ngiven will stimulate further ideas.\nChapter 5 considers aligning assessment with\nobjectives, the selection of appropriate methods\nand the amount, length and timing of\nassessments. Readers are asked questions on the\nvalidity, reliability, authenticity and openness of\ntheir chosen methods and the chapter ends with\na useful checklist on the design of assessment\ntasks.\nIn Chapter 6 the important aspect of the\ncommunication of assessment tasks is discussed.\nThe need for clear and sufficient information is\nconsidered and the impact on students when this\nis inadequate is highlighted. There is a very\nhelpful section on the development of marking\ncriteria and suggestions for the moderation of\nnew assessment tasks before they can be used.\nChapter 7 gives straightforward and practical\nadvice on marking and grading, and giving\nfeedback. The issue of authentication is con-\nsidered and, whilst stating that most adult open\nand distance learners are highly motivated and\nwould consider cheating an anathema, it is\nsuggested that we must ensure that the processes\nwhich ensure authentication must not also under-\nmine the learning experiences of the students.\nSome helpful ideas are offered from Benson\n(1996) which suggests the following activities:\n\u2022 link assignments so that each builds on the\nformer;\n\u2022 individualize topics as far as possible with\nthe use of students' own workplaces, lives\nand values as the source of discussion;\n\u2022 use self-directed forms of learning such as\nlearning contracts;\n\u2022 use work-based mentors, supervisors or\nassessors;\n\u2022 use video- and audio-based presentations as\nan alternative to print;\n\u2022 consider oral assessments via the telephone;\n\u2022 adapt and change the assessment topics\nregularly whilst maintaining the alignment\nbetween objectives, content and teaching\nand learning activities.\nChapters 8 and 9 give sensitive consideration on\nhow to facilitate dialogue and communicate\nempathetically in an ODL environment and how\nto deal with communication breakdown. The\nconcept of learning communities is considered\nand strategies for enhancing self-management\nand time management are identified. In Chapter\n10 the link between ODL assessment policies\nand institutional policies is discussed. The\nstatement that 'policies reveal values' is\nilluminative in the context of how we value\nstudent learning and the degree to which we\nendeavour to put our students before institu-\ntional convenience. The last chapter in this\nsection gives some timely advice on the variety of\nways in which we can explore the effectiveness\nand efficiency of our assessment procedures.\nPart C presents a selection of case studies that\nillustrate a variety of assessments. These have\nbeen organized to demonstrate the categories of\nlearning outcomes developed by Nightingale et\nal. (1996), Assessing Learning in Universities:\n1. Thinking critically and making judgements.\n2. Solving problems and developing plans.\n3. Performing procedures and developing plans.\n4. Managing and developing oneself.\n5. Accessing and managing information.\n6. Demonstrating knowledge and understanding.\n7. Designing, creating, performing.\n8. Communicating.\nThe thirty-one case studies presented are drawn\nfrom a wide range of disciplines, including\neducation, nursing, business, anthropology, eco-\nnomics, philosophy, mathematics, agriculture and\npsychology. Although I found it interesting to\nread what other people were doing, I did not find\nthis section as helpful as Parts A and B. Using so\n81\nReviews\nmany case studies inevitably means that each is\ngiven only brief coverage and it was not always\neasy to get a complete picture of the issues and\nstrategies involved. Nevertheless demonstrating\nthe learning outcomes through the case studies\nwas an innovative and appropriate way to draw\nthe main themes of the book together.\nThe authors are to be commended on producing\na timely and readable book on this important\ntopic which I recommend to all involved in the\ndevelopment and management of ODL. It has\nmuch to offer to both those with experience in\nODL and those considering moving into this\narea of practice. A comprehensive reference list\nidentifies many familiar sources but also a range\nof other authors and texts that will be worth\nfollowing up.\nGillian Jordan\nUniversity of Greenwich\nO.

Pressure of student\nnumbers, competition with our neighbour\nuniversities and declining units of resource have\nmeant that we need to look closely at the\nmethods and tools of open and distance\nlearning. We have our own institution-wide\nmanaged learning environment and supplement\nthis with Web-based resources and resource-\nbased learning. Amongst other things, we are\ntrying to support part-time students in full-time\njobs and full-time students in part-time jobs and\ntrying to optimize staff- student contact by\nusing as many other media as possible to provide\nand supplement student support. So to direct\nthis book solely at academics working in open\nand distance learning is seriously to under-sell it.\nThere are lots of ideas we could all look at.\nThe coverage is thorough and very systematic,\ntaking the reader through advising, supporting,\ntutoring and retaining students from a variety of\nbackgrounds. The author's personal experience\nand topical anecdotes serve to underline the\nbook's credibility.\nOne area that might need more attention is that\nof the virtual or managed learning environments,\nsuch as WebCT, WOLF or COSE. Whilst these\nsystems may only combine existing functionality,\n82\nspecifically conferencing, email and content\ntransmission, the combination gives considerable\nsynergy and these systems are set to grow.\nAlso some other topics, towards the end of the\nbook, particularly 'Structure, Quality and Staff\nDevelopment in Student Support' and \"Theories\nof Student Support' (the latter looks at models\nof interaction from counselling psychology) are\nless satisfying.\nWhilst the brief introduction to counselling is\nuseful, it does not do the subject justice. Also\nthere is actually an increasing interest in online\ncounselling within the professional counselling\ncommunity, for example in the British\nAssociation for Counselling and Psychotherapy's\njournal Counselling. This area could be reviewed\nin subsequent editions and used to build a better\nmodel of educational guidance based on online\npsychological counselling practice.\nAs many institutions in the UK consider the\nadaptation and adoption of the techniques of\nopen and distance learning, they are faced with\nthe issue of quality. In particular they are faced\nwith making sense of the all-embracing but\nrather abstract guidelines from the QAA on\ndistance learning. The 'Structure, Quality and\nStaff Development in Student Support' chapter\ncould have spent some time looking at the wider\nimplications of 'quality' implied by bodies such\nas the QAA.\nHaving said that, I am tasked with supporting\nstaff in my school as it moves towards more\ntechnology-supported learning and this is clearly\nthe kind of book I could recommend to my\ncolleagues - systematic, comprehensive and\npractical.\nJohn Traxler\nUniversity of Wolverhampton\nLyn Pemberton and Simon Shurville (eds.), Words\non the Web: Computer-mediated Communication,\nExeter Intellect Books, 2000. ISBN: 1-871516-\n56-0. Softback, iv+124 pages, \u00a314.95.\nNew computer-mediated communication tech-\nnologies, such as video-conferencing, email and\nthe Web have provided many different ways to\ninteract with other people. The Web alone has\nspawned chat-rooms, special interest discussion\ngroups and marketing opportunities. This book\nconsiders the emergence and development of\nnovel linguistic and social conventions for using\nthese media. Some of the papers in the book\nwere specially commissioned, some were adapted\nAk-j Volume 9 Number 2\nfrom presentations at a workshop in Computer-\nmediated Communication (CMC) organized by\none of the editors (LP) at the Sociolinguistics\nSymposium in Cardiff in 1997. Others are\ndeveloped from presentations at the Writing and\nComputers Conference run by both editors in\nBrighton, also in 1997. I found some of the\npapers slightly dated, given the exponential\ngrowth of Web access and use in the public\ndomain in the last two years with the advent of\nfree Internet service providers (ISPs) and un-\nmetered Web access.\nSo, what are the objectives of this book?\nAccording to the introduction: \"The aim has\nbeen to give coverage of as wide a range of\napproaches and phenomena possible at every\nlevel of interest to students of language, from\nthe mechanics of replicating paralinguistic\nfeatures in email to the pragmatics of multi-\nlingual communication and from the grammat-\nical features of Web page anchor text to the\nnegotiation of meaning in an email discussion\non traditional song.' The approach is certainly\nwide-ranging, spanning experimental psycho-\nlinguistics, systemic linguistics, social identity\ntheory and conversation analysis.\nThe book comprises twelve chapters, which are\nsplit into two distinct sections. The first section\ncovers the issues of new language structures used\nin networked and computer-supported commu-\nnication (such as the hypertext link mechanism\nthat is discussed in Chapter 1). The second\nsection of the collection focuses on the language-\nbased behaviours of users of CMC technologies.\nJaime Henriquez in Chapter 1 analyses the\ndifferences between traditional print media and\nWeb communication. The focus of this analysis\nis via hypertext links. These links are the\nconnections between a point on one Web page\nand another. He concludes that this directional\nlinking and the palimpsest display place a\ngreater load on the reader to supply context.\nChapter 2 discusses knowledge content and\nnarrative structure in terms of conversation\ntheory. In Chapter 3, Einat Amitay tries to\nidentify emerging linguistic characteristics of\nWeb pages, concluding that consistent authoring\nchoices are being made by Web authors to\nexplain context. Chapter 4, by Helmut Gruber, is\nentitled 'Scholarly email discussion list postings:\na single new genre of academic commu-\nnication?'. Gruber analyses two lists, ETHNO\nand LINGUIST, and concludes that scholarly\nemail discussions do form a single genre, which\nis characterized by academic letter-writing as\nwell as oral communication. Chapter 5 (by\nPirkko Raudaskowski) discusses the use of\ncommunicative resources in Internet video-\nconferencing between groups of students in\nFinland and Sweden, using the CU-SeeMe\nsystem. In the final chapter of Part One, Fouser,\nInoue and Lee discuss the pragmatics of orality\nin English, Japanese and Korean computer-\nmediated communication. They analyse syn-\nchronous chat-room data and asynchronous\npublic newsgroup postings in all three languages.\nChapter 7 marks the start of Part Two of the\nbook. In this chapter Zazie Todd and Stephanie\nWalker investigate multilingualism on the Net,\nand the use of the Web for the support of\nlanguage. The following contribution by Sandra\nHarrison (Chapter 8) then describes the use of\npoliteness strategies in an email discussion group\nas a means of maintaining the virtual com-\nmunity. This paper uses Brown and Levinson's\n1987 work on politeness and concludes that the\nframework can usefully be applied to email\ndiscourse. In Chapter 9 Heather Matthews\naddresses the effects of group identity on\ndiscussions in public online forums, comparing a\ncomputer professionals' forum as a concrete\nfocus forum and a new age discussion group as a\nforum with an abstract emotional focus. Next, in\nChapter 10, Sonja Launspach zooms in to the\nnegotiation of meaning in an Internet discussion\nlist. She focuses on a single discussion to\ndemonstrate '. . . some of the difficulties that\nparticipants encounter in deriving the intended\ninterpretation for utterances in the contextual\nenvironment of Cyberspace'. In Chapter 11,\nJacqueline Taylor attempts a social psycho-\nlogical analysis of computer-mediated group\ninteraction. Finally, Luiz Perez-Gonzalez writes\non the interactional implications of computer\nmediation in emergency calls, concluding that\nelectronic data entry forms are restrictive, and\nneed a more flexible layout. However, computer-\nmediated interaction can assist in the detection\nof hoax calls.\nMy overall conclusion about Words on the Web\nis that it offers a fascinating overview of the\ndiversity of approaches to the analysis of ways\nin which language is used in computer-mediated\ncommunication. I felt that it lacks cohesion, but\nnevertheless provides an interesting introduction\nfor the language student or Web user.\nLinda Clark\nUniversity of Glasgow\n83\n"}
