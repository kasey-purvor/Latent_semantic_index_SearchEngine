Received 2001 March 1; in original form 2000 December 21\nA B S T R A C T\nWe present the first detailed hydrodynamic simulation of a superoutburst to incorporate the\nfull tidal potential of a binary system. A two-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics\ncode is used to simulate a superoutburst in a binary with the parameters of the SU UMa\nsystem Z Chamaeleontis. The simulated light curves shows all the features observed in such\nsystems. Analysis of the mass flux through the disc and the growth rate of the superhumps and\ndisc eccentricity show that the superoutburst\u2013superhump phenomenon is a direct result of\ntidal instability. No enhanced mass transfer from the secondary is required to initiate or\nsustain these phenomena. Comparisons of superoutbursts with normal outbursts are made and\nwe show that the model can be reconciled with the behaviour of U Geminorum-type dwarf\nnovae, which show no superoutbursts.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs \u2013 instabilities \u2013 methods: numerical \u2013 binaries: close \u2013\nnovae, cataclysmic variables.\n1 I N T R O D U C T I O N\nSU Ursae Majoris systems are a class of cataclysmic variable\nwhich lie below the period gap (they have Porb , 2:1 h\u00de and which\ndiffer in their outburst behaviour from dwarf novae in two distinct\nways: in addition to the normal outbursts displayed by dwarf novae\nwhich last two to three days, SU UMa systems undergo longer\nsuperoutbursts. These show a plateau of brightness extending the\noutburst to 10 days or more. Also, during a superoutburst, the light\ncurve of an SU UMa reveals superhumps \u2013 a superimposed\nvariation in brightness with a period a few percent longer than the\norbital period of the system. It has been suggested that normal and\nsuperoutbursts do not coexist independently of each other, with a\nsuperoutburst being initiated by a normal outburst. There is\nevidence for a relaxation time of ,170 d in VW Hyi (van der\nWoerd & van Paradijs 1987), with all normal outbursts triggering a\nsuperoutburst if they occur 170 d or longer after the previous\nsuperoutburst.\n1.1 Outburst mechanisms\nHistorically, two models have been proposed to explain dwarf nova\noutbursts: a varying mass-transfer rate from the secondary owing to\nits envelope being dynamically unstable (Bath 1973), or a varying\nviscosity in the accretion disc between quiescent and outburst\nstates (Hoshi 1979). It is the disc instability model that has\nprevailed as the accepted explanation, offering better compatibility\nwith modern observations and theory. An excellent review is given\nby Cannizzo (1993). We have recently used a smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) model to simulate a wide range of dwarf\nnova outburst characteristics (Truss et al. 2000).\nA complete theory of superoutbursts has been much more\nelusive. Several models have been presented, however few explain\nall the necessary properties, in particular the superhumps which\nappear without fail in every superoutburst. Models involving mass-\ntransfer instabilities (Osaki 1985), disc instabilities (Osaki 1989)\nand both (Duschl & Livio 1989) all explain some properties of a\nsuperoutburst. A brief summary of these can be found in Warner\n(1995). Simulations by Whitehurst (1988) showed that discs in\nbinaries with mass ratios q & 1=4\u20131=3 could become tidally\nunstable. Unlike stable discs which had a shape that was fixed in\nthe binary frame, these unstable discs were significantly eccentric.\nIn the inertial frame this eccentricity executed a slow prograde\nprecession. Thus in the binary frame the disc precessed\nretrogradely. Whitehurst found that the tidal stresses on the\nprecessing disc gave rise to a periodically varying light curve that\nneatly explained superhumps. The disc instability was explained in\ndetail by Lubow (1991a) in terms of an (eccentric inner) Lindblad\nresonance that occurs where orbits in the disc are 3 : 1 resonant\nwith the binary orbit. Only discs in systems with mass ratios\nq , 1=4\u20131=3 are large enough to reach the resonance. This\ntheoretical result closely matches the spread of cataclysmic\nvariables that are observed to have superhumps (Patterson 1998).\nOsaki (1989) espoused a superoutburst model which combined\nthe thermal and tidal instabilities. His model relied on the outer\ndisc radius varying significantly over the course of a superoutburst\ncycle. At the end of a superoutburst, Osaki proposed that the disc\nradius was small so that it could not access the 3 : 1 resonance.\nHence when the disc became thermally unstable, a normal dwarf\nnova outburst occurred. As a result of the outburst however, the*E-mail: mtr@star.le.ac.uk\nMon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 324, L1\u2013L5 (2001)\nq 2001 RAS\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 8, 2013\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \ndisc spread radially. With each successive normal outburst the disc\ngrew until it encountered the 3 : 1 resonance and became tidally as\nwell as thermally unstable. Osaki proposed but could not\nconclusively show, that the tidal removal of angular momentum\nwas much more efficient from an eccentric disc. Consequently,\nwhen the disc encountered the resonance it would dump a large\nfraction of its mass upon the white dwarf. A prolonged \u2018super\u2019\noutburst that left a much diminished disc resulted. Osaki\u2019s model\ncould not be carried too far as the efficiency with which tides\nremoved angular momentum from the outer disc could not be\ndetermined with certainty. Osaki, and other workers, were relying\nupon one dimensional numerical models for disc evolution in\nwhich the tidal forces had only been included approximately.\nIn this paper we report the results of a smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) simulation of a cataclysmic variable binary\nwith mass ratio q \u00bc M2=M1 \u00bc 0:15, representative of the SU UMa\nsystem Z Chamaeleontis. As the code is fully three-dimensional\n(although for the purposes of this paper the third dimension has\nbeen suppressed), tidal forces are included exactly. Thus for the\nfirst time we are able to follow the evolution of an accretion disc\nover the course of a superoutburst.\n2 N U M E R I C A L M E T H O D\n2.1 The model\nThe model and methods used in this work have already been\ndescribed in our recent paper (Truss et al. 2000), as applied to a\nsystem with the properties of SS Cygni (q\u00bc 0.6). The SPH code\ndirectly includes the tidal forces due to the secondary, and\nincorporates a simple model for the dwarf nova thermal instability.\nThe key to our calculations lies in the implementation of a\nviscosity switch. If the local surface density exceeds a defined\nvalue Smax then that region is transformed to the high-viscosity\noutburst state on a time-scale appropriate to the thermal time-scale.\nThere is a corresponding second trigger level, Smin, which causes\nthe viscosity to be switched back down to the quiescent level. In\nthis way we can simulate the limit-cycle behaviour of a dwarf nova\nwith an isothermal simulation. Viscosity switches are nothing new\nin themselves in disc simulations, but in the past they have used\ntrigger levels which are constant throughout the disc. This is an\nunrealistic situation. Cannizzo, Shafter & Wheeler (1988) have\ncalculated the format for the critical values of surface density S in a\nsteady-state disc and found an almost linear relationship with disc\nradius R (Cannizzo, Shafter & Wheeler 1988, equations 2.1 and\n2.2). Therefore, we implement a linear S\u2013R relationship for the\ndisc in steady-state.\nThere are, however, some important refinements that have been\nmade for this study which were not made previously. In Truss et al.\n(2000) we incorporated an azimuthally smoothed trigger condition,\nin which the density condition was only tested for annuli in the\ndisc. This is unsatisfactory for work on a system with a more\nextreme mass ratio because the outer regions of the disc depart\nstrongly from azimuthal symmetry in response to the tidal\nresonance. We therefore calculate our trigger condition absolutely\nlocally for every particle in the simulation. We also previously used\nan enhanced viscosity parameter \u00f0a \u00bc 0:1 in quiescence and a \u00bc\n1:0 in outburst) to improve the run-time of the code. The desire to\nexamine the growth-rate of superhumps on the correct time-scale\nhas motivated us to use more realistic viscosity parameters here at\nthe expense of simulating many outburst cycles. We use a \u00bc 0:01\nin quiescence and a \u00bc 0:1 in outburst, typical of the values in a\ndwarf nova disc (see, Shakura & Sunyaev 1973 for a discussion of\nthis viscosity parametrization). We use other physical parameters\nrelevant to observations of Z Cha \u2013 Porb \u00bc 0:075 d, _M2 \u00bc\n2 \u0004 1015 g s21 (both from Wood et al. 1986) and M1 \u00bc 0:84 M(\n(Wade & Horne 1988). The disc is built up from a mass stream and\nundergoes normal outbursts during the build-up to steady state in\nexactly the same way as our previous simulations (Truss et al.\n2000).\n3 R E S U LT S\n3.1 Light curves\nWe present light curves through the entire superoutburst. The\ncurves are constructed by summing the viscous dissipation in\ndifferent regions of the disc. In this way we are able to compare the\nresults with observed light curves in different wavebands. This\napproach differs slightly from our previous work, in which we\nattempted to reconstruct several wavebands by treating the disc as a\nblack body. Since the observed optical emission is expected to be\ndominated by the cooler outer regions of the disc and the extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) emission is dominated by the very hot inner\nFigure 1. Viscous dissipation from disc radii R . 20Rwd. This is\nrepresentative of the observed visual light curve. The scale of the\ndissipation program units is logarithmic and t \u00bc 0 represents the beginning\nof the outburst.\nFigure 2. Viscous dissipation from R , 10Rwd. There is a noticeable\nrebrightening around t \u00bc 10 d.\nL2 M. R. Truss et al.\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 324, L1\u2013L5\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 8, 2013\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nregion, we can gain a qualitative understanding of the behaviour of\nthe disc with this simplified approach. A more quantitative analysis\nshould be left to future work in which full thermodynamics is\nincorporated self-consistently. Fig. 1 shows the viscous dissipation\nfrom the outer parts of the disc \u00f0R * 20Rwd\u00de. The profile and\nduration of the outburst is in good agreement with V-band\nobservations of SU UMa systems. The initial rise to outburst is\nfairly rapid, lasting for two days, and is followed by the\ncharacteristic superoutburst plateau. Superhumps begin to appear\nprominently at t \u00bc 8 d. The decay of the superhumps in the\nsimulation is slower than observations have suggested \u2013 they\npersist (albeit with decreasing amplitude) during and just after the\ndecline from supermaximum. Buat-Me\u00b4nard, Hameury & Lasota\n(2000) included the effects of stream-impact heating in a one-\ndimensional model, and showed that this causes the functional\nform of the critical surface density to rapidly decrease at the disc\nedge. We believe that this would cause the outer disc to drain faster\nthan in our simulation and drive the edge away from the resonance\nmore quickly, suppressing the superhumps sooner. The decay from\nsupermaximum is slower than the rise, lasting for 5 d. The total\nduration of the simulated superoutburst is around 18 d. Recent\nExtreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE ) observations of OY\nCarinae, which has a similar mass ratio to Z Cha, have shown\nthat in addition to the expected delay between the optical and EUV\nrise, the EUV emission shows a rebrightening during superoutburst\nwhich is not seen in the V-band (Mauche, Mattei & Bateson 2000).\nWe are able to look for this effect in the simulation by\nconsideration of the viscous dissipation coming from the hot,\ninner part of the disc \u00f0R & 10Rwd\u00de, which is shown in Fig. 2 and the\naccretion rate onto the white dwarf (a good measure of the X-ray\nlight curve \u2013 Fig. 3). The rebrightening can clearly be seen in both\nfigures, and is caused by the arrival of additional material from the\nouter disc which has been tidally forced into the high state.\n3.2 Disc response\nIt is particularly instructive to construct a visualization of the disc\nat various times through the superoutburst cycle. Fig. 4 shows\ndissipation maps of the disc in four states. The hotspot and spiral\nstructure of the disc are clearly visible. In quiescence, the disc is\nnot in contact with the 3 : 1 resonance; consequently it is circular.\nThe innermost part of the disc remains in the high state. This is in\nagreement with our previous work on SS Cygni. The outburst\nprogresses just as for a normal outburst, but during this time the\ndisc radius increases and the edge of the disc encounters the\nresonance. We stress that this resonance is not available to systems\nwith less extreme mass ratios. The disc rapidly becomes eccentric\nand virtually the entire disc is transformed to the high viscosity\noutburst state. It is interesting to note the brightness of the hotspotFigure 3. Mass accretion rate on to the primary.\nFigure 4. Viscous dissipation from the disc. Top left: quiescence \u00f0t \u00bc 0 d\u00de; top right: rise to outburst before contact with the resonance \u00f0t \u00bc 3 d\u00de; bottom left:\nsuperoutburst \u00f0t \u00bc 13 d\u00de; bottom right: after superoutburst \u00f0t \u00bc 23 d\u00de. The colour scaling is logarithmic from 107 erg s21 cm22 to 109 erg s21 cm22. The white\ncentral portion of the disc \u00f0R , 4Rwd\u00de is not modelled in the simulation. This figure is available in colour on Synergy, the online version of the journal.\nSuperoutbursts in dwarf novae L3\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 324, L1\u2013L5\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 8, 2013\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nin the lower-left hand panel of Fig. 4. During supermaximum, we\nfind that the brightness of the hotspot varies according to the\norientation of the eccentric disc. This is not due to a varying mass\ntransfer rate from the secondary \u2013 this remains constant at all times\nduring the simulation \u2013 it is purely a result of the geometry of the\nstream impact region. The existence of such an effect in the nova-\nlike V348 Pup has been reported by Rolfe, Haswell & Patterson\n(2000). Fig. 5 shows the evolution of surface density with disc\nradius. Initially, the inner regions \u00f0R & 0:25a\u00de go into outburst\n(solid line), but it should be noted that the large reservoir of mass at\nlarger radii is very close to the upper critical threshold.\nConsequently, it is only a short time before nearly the whole disc\nis in outburst, and at supermaximum the large reservoir of mass is\nseen to move to smaller radii (dot\u2013dashed line). At the end of the\nsuperoutburst, a large fraction of the disc has been accreted (stars);\n,60 per cent, compared with,5\u201310 per cent for a normal outburst.\n3.3 Modal analysis and superhumps\nWe compare the response of the disc to the tidal field of the\nsecondary star with the analysis of Lubow (1991a). The tidal\npotential can be decomposed into a set of functions\nf\u00f0r; u; t\u00de \u00bc\nX1\nm\u00bc0\nfm\u00f0r\u00de cos\u00bdm\u00f0u2Vorbt\u00de\u0006; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere each mode m generates a sinusoidal response in the disc\nwith argument \u00f0ku2 lVorbt\u00de. The (k, l )\u00bc (1,0) mode represents the\ndisc eccentricity, which grows exponentially at a rate\nl \u00bc 2:08 \u0004 2pVorbq 2r2res\nS\u00f0rres\u00de\nMdisc\n: \u00f02\u00de\nS(r) is the surface density of the disc at radius r, Mdisc is the mass of\nthe disc and rres is the radius of the Lindblad resonance. This\nresonance couples with any existing eccentricity to launch a two-\narmed travelling spiral wave with (k, l )\u00bc (2,3). The response of\nthese two modes in our simulation is shown in Fig. 6. It is\nimmediately clear that, as Lubow predicted, the growth of\neccentricity is proportional to the strength of the (2,3) mode. For\ntimes less than t \u00bc 11 d in the simulation, the growth rate of the\n(1,0) mode was\nl \u00bc 0:0075 ^ 0:0002Vorb;\nwhich compares favourably with the analytical prediction for this\nsystem of\nl . 0:01Vorb:\nLet us turn to the superhumps themselves. The superhump period\nis, as expected from observations, slightly longer than the orbital\nperiod, and gradually decreasing as the outburst progresses. A fast\nFourier transform of the dissipation data in the range where the\neccentricity growth is a maximum \u00f09:5\u201312 d\u00de yields the period\nPsh \u00bc 1:039 ^ 0:008Porb:\nHowever, between 12 and 18.5 d, when the superhumps are fully\ndeveloped, we obtain\nPsh \u00bc 1:029 ^ 0:003Porb:\nThese results are in excellent agreement with the observations\ncollated by Warner & O\u2019Donoghue (1988), who found the\nsuperhump period to decrease according to\nPsh \u00bc \u00f01:03892 0:0007T\u00dePorb;\nwhere T is the time after the beginning of the outburst in days. Fig.\n7 shows a 15-h portion of the light curve from the same region of\nthe disc as defined in Fig. 1. We also find a strong superhump signal\nproduced from the inner part of the disc. This emission results from\nthe spiral shock wave reaching all the way down into this region,\nand the effect can be seen with striking clarity in the map of the\ndisc in Fig. 8.\n4 D I S C U S S I O N\nWe have performed the first two-dimensional simulation of a dwarf\nnova superoutburst. The method includes the full tidal potential of\nthe binary and reproduces the observed characteristics of a\nsuperoutburst with no need for enhanced mass transfer from the\nsecondary star. This leads us to conclude that the superoutburst\u2013\nsuperhump phenomenon is purely a result of the tidal instability\nworking in tandem with the thermal disc instability. Superoutbursts\nare therefore not seen in systems with less extreme mass ratios\n\u00f0q * 0:25\u00de because the tidal resonance is not available to them.\nWe feel that there is much confusion in the literature regarding\nFigure 6. Relative mode strengths. The edge of the disc encounters the 3 : 1\nresonance around t \u00bc 5 d, producing a rapid growth in the eccentric mode\n(1,0). The (2,3) mode represents a travelling spiral wave launched at the\nresonance.\nFigure 5. Surface density evolution of the disc.The plots correspond to\ntimes t \u00bc 5:0 d (solid line), t \u00bc 10:3 d (dot\u2013dashed line) and t \u00bc 18:1 d\n(stars). The straight lines are the critical surface density conditions Smax and\nSmin from the S-curve disc instability model. a is the binary separation.\nL4 M. R. Truss et al.\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 324, L1\u2013L5\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 8, 2013\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nthe terminology of \u2018wide\u2019 and \u2018narrow\u2019, \u2018inside-out\u2019 and \u2018outside-\nin\u2019 outbursts. This work coupled with our previous study of normal\noutbursts suggests the following.\n(i) An outburst may be initiated at any point in the disc and in\ngeneral the resultant heating wave will travel in both directions.\n(ii) All types of dwarf nova can exhibit both wide and narrow\noutbursts. The physical distinction between the two is simply\nwhether the heating wave propagates to the large reservoir of mass\nstored in the outer parts of the disc or not.\n(iii) The superoutburst\/superhump phenomenon is a result of the\npresence of the tidal instability, in addition to the thermal\ninstability. The tidal instability is responsible for superhumps, and\nthe duration of a superoutburst is primarily determined by the hot\nregion of the disc arising from the thermal instability. However, the\nduration will be lengthened by the enhanced mass accretion arising\nfrom the tidally heated gas, which produces the EUV rebrightening\ndiscussed in Section 3.1.\nLong-term observations of dwarf novae are still needed across a\nvariety of wavebands in order to improve our understanding of\nthese objects. EUV and X-ray observations will reveal much about\nthe physics of the boundary layer between the disc and the surface\nof the white dwarf, while eclipse mapping and Doppler\ntomography should probe the structure of the disc and the role of\nthe spiral waves. We also point out that observations of the growth\nrate of superhumps can be used to gain estimates for mass ratio,\nthrough referral to Lubow\u2019s modal analysis that we have reprised\nhere.\nIt is very important to concentrate on two and three dimensional\nsimulations in the future, as the full tidal field is inherent in these\nmodels. The next step should be to perform a 3D calculation which\nincludes fully self-consistent thermodynamics. One can envisage a\nhybrid of a 2D isothermal code such as this one with a traditional\n1D thermodynamics code. This is a mammoth task in terms of\ncomputational requirements, but all the components of such a\nmodel already exist.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nResearch in theoretical astrophysics at Leicester is supported by a\nPPARC rolling grant.
