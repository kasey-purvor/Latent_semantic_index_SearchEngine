Ground-based images of auroral optical emissions\nand cosmic radio noise absorption provide information on\nparticle precipitation which enhances ionospheric conduc-\ntances. Knowledge of this conductance field is important to\nunderstand the current systems associated with auroral fea-\ntures. Three methods of using ground-based optical and ri-\nometer data to estimate ionospheric conductances in the au-\nrora are compared to conductances derived from incoherent\nscatter radar measurements. It is shown that a method using\nthe 557.7 nm emission intensity alone gives the best results\nfor the Pedersen conductance whilst a method using both this\nintensity and cosmic noise absorption is best for the Hall con-\nductance. A method using cosmic noise absorption alone\ngives reasonable performance for the Hall conductance and\nthe Hall\/Pedersen conductance ratio, but performs poorly for\nthe Pedersen conductance. It also appears to underestimate\nthe Hall conductance significantly during times when softer\nprecipitation is present, for example in discrete auroral arcs.\nThere is some indication that the methods do not degrade no-\nticeably for angles up to \u223c20\u25e6 off magnetic zenith.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Electric fields\nand currents; Ionosphere-magnetosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nIn studies of the aurora, it is important to be able to under-\nstand the spatial structure of the electrical current systems\nwhich couple the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The cur-\nrents can be measured in situ by spacecraft, or inferred from\nground-based magnetometer measurements. However, the\nformer cannot \u201cimage\u201d the two-dimensional distribution of\ncurrents (without many spacecraft) and the latter is insensi-\ntive to the curl-free part of the current system (Amm, 1997).\nCorrespondence to: A. Senior\n(a.senior@lancaster.ac.uk)\nThe currents can be indirectly determined from Ohm\u2019s Law\nif the electric field and conductivity distributions are known.\nThe former can be obtained from ground-based coherent\nscatter radars (Greenwald et al., 1978, 1995) on global and\nmeso-scales (\u223c10\u2013100 km). The latter can be obtained on\nglobal scales by inverting spacecraft measurements of auro-\nral emissions (e.g. Aksnes et al., 2006), but these lack the\nresolution for meso-scale studies around individual auroral\narcs. In those cases, ground-based measurements of opti-\ncal emissions and cosmic radio noise absorption (CNA) give\ninformation on the precipitating electrons which create the\nionisation leading to conductivity and these can be used to\ndetermine the meso-scale conductivity distribution.\nIn this study, three different methods of determining the\nionospheric height-integrated conductivities (conductances)\nfrom optical and CNA measurements are compared. As a ref-\nerence, the conductances derived from EISCAT incoherent\nscatter radar measurements are used. All three methods were\noriginally calibrated by such measurements, but the data sets\nused here were not used in those calibrations and in that sense\nprovide an independent test. The main aim of this study is to\ninvestigate under what circumstances each method performs\nwell or poorly and consequently what might be required to\nform a better approach.\nThe study is restricted in that only measurements close to\nthe magnetic field-line direction (magnetic zenith) are con-\nsidered. Hence, ambiguities between horizontal and vertical\nstructure in single-viewpoint images of the aurora are largely\navoided. These could be a significant limitation of the meth-\nods in practice. Approaches based on tomographic inver-\nsion of multiple-viewpoint data are needed to overcome this\n(Nygre\u00b4n et al., 1996; Gustavsson, 1998; Janhunen, 2001).\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3832 A. Senior et al.: Comparison of conductance determinations\n2 The methods tested\nThe three methods under test in this study are summarised as\nfollows.\n2.1 Statistical relationships using CNA alone (S07)\nSenior et al. (2007) presented a set of statistical relationships\nbetween cosmic noise absorption and the Hall and Pedersen\nconductances and their ratio for five different sectors of MLT.\nThe relationships were derived by comparing conductances\ncalculated from EISCAT measurements with CNA measure-\nments from the nearby imaging riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi in Fin-\nland. Senior et al. (2007) fitted power-law functions to the\ndata arguing that these seemed most suited to the data in the\nabsence of any simple physical argument to support another\nform of function. The relationships had the most explain-\ning power for the Hall conductance. Hereinafter, this method\nwill be referred to as \u201cS07\u201d.\n2.2 Statistical relationship using 557.7 nm intensity alone\n(K98)\nOn the basis that the 557.7 nm column emission rate (inten-\nsity) is proportional to the flux of precipitating electrons and\nthat the Pedersen conductance is proportional to the square-\nroot of this flux, Kosch et al. (1998b) fitted the conductance\n(6P in S) to the square-root of the intensity (I in rayleighs):\n6P = 0.34+ 0.18\n\u221a\nI (1)\nThe study considered both pre- and post-magnetic midnight\ntime sectors and found no significant difference in the rela-\ntionship between these sectors. The data sets used spanned\n\u223c19.5\u201305.5 MLT with most of the data in the 21.5\u201303.5 MLT\ninterval. Interestingly, Senior et al. (2007) found that the\nconductance-CNA relationships were more-or-less constant\nduring the 19:00\u201304:00 MLT interval.\n2.3 \u201cEnergy map\u201d method (K01)\nKosch et al. (2001) combined both CNA and the 557.7 nm\ncolumn intensity to estimate the characteristic energy of elec-\ntron precipitation. Their approach was to use measurements\nto calibrate a simple physical model of the CNA and optical\nintensity in terms of the characteristic energy for assumed\nMaxwellian or exponential precipitating electron spectra.\nThe objective was to produce high spatial-resolution maps\nof characteristic energy from imaging riometer and all-sky\ncamera images, hence the description \u201cenergy map\u201d. As\nthe method gives only the energy and not the flux, only the\nHall\/Pedersen conductance ratio can be directly determined\nby this approach. Here, the method is extended to determine\nthe flux for the case of a Maxwellian spectrum.\nKosch et al. (2001) made the assumption that the\n38.2 MHz CNA (A in dB) is proportional to the square-root\nof the flux of precipitating electrons with energies exceeding\n25 keV (825): A=k825. The differential number flux \u03c6 (in\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 keV\u22121) for a Maxwellian spectrum is\n\u03c6 = 8\nE20\nE exp(\u2212E\/E0) (2)\nwhere E is the energy in keV, 8 is the integral flux in\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 and E0 is the characteristic energy in keV. The dif-\nferential flux peaks when E=E0. The flux of electrons with\nenergies exceeding 25 keV is then\n825 =\n\u222b \u221e\n25\n8\nE20\nE exp(\u2212E\/E0) dE\n= 8\n(\n1+ 25\nE0\n)\nexp\n(\n\u2212 25\nE0\n)\n(3)\nand hence\nA = k\n\u221a\n8\n(\n1+ 25\nE0\n)\nexp\n(\n\u2212 25\nE0\n)\n(4)\nwhere k is a constant to be determined.\nThe dataset used by Kosch et al. (2001) gives values of\n8 and E0 from the inversion of the EISCAT electron den-\nsity profiles and the corresponding CNA data measured by\nthe IRIS riometer (see Sect. 3.1). The fluxes used by Kosch\net al. (2001) are differential in pitch angle; to convert these\nto fluxes integral in pitch angle over the downward hemi-\nsphere as used here, the Kosch et al. (2001) fluxes are mul-\ntiplied by 2pi . Figure 1 presents the data and the least-\nsquares fit of Eq. (4). Note that, in keeping with Kosch\net al. (2001), points where the CNA was less than 0.07 dB\nhave been excluded. The relationship is reasonably linear\nwith a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8. The fit gives\nk=2.4\u00d710\u22124 dB cm s1\/2. This result appears to be reason-\nably consistent with the empirical relations quoted in Ta-\nble 1 of Hargreaves (1969) when the difference in riometer\nfrequency (30 MHz versus 38.2 MHz) and minimum energy\n(40 keV versus 25 keV) is accounted for.\nHaving established this relationship and given measure-\nments of the CNA and 557.7 nm intensity the integral flux 8\ncan be determined by first findingE0 using Eq. (18) of Kosch\net al. (2001):\nloge\nA\u221a\nI\n= 1.0\u2212 8.8\nE0\n(5)\nwhere I is the 557.7 nm intensity in kR and then solving\nEq. (4) for 8. Finally, the Hall (6H ) and Pedersen (6P )\nconductances can be estimated from 8 and E0 by applying\nthe formulae of Robinson et al. (1987):\n6P = 40E\u00af16+ E\u00af28\n1\/2\nE (6)\n6H\n6P\n= 0.45(E\u00af)0.85 (7)\nThese require the mean energy (keV) and the energy flux\n(erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 or mW m\u22122), which for the Maxwellian case,\nAnn.

The EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter\nradar is located at Ramfjordmoen, near Troms\u00f8, Norway\n(69.58\u25e6 N, 19.22\u25e6 E; Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993). In this\nstudy we use two intervals of data, one from 8\/9 March 1999\n(Case 1) and the other from 23 November 2006 (Case 2).\nThese intervals were selected due to the conjunction of avail-\nable data from the radar and the all-sky imager and riometer\nused and also because they contain significant auroral activ-\nity over several hours. In Case 1, the radar was operating\nin the Common Programme 2 mode, where the antenna is\nscanned between four different look directions with a dwell\ntime of \u223c90 s on each position, making a 6-min cycle. The\nlook directions are vertical, magnetic field-aligned (azimuth\n183.2\u25e6, elevation 77.2\u25e6), (166.5\u25e6, 62.9\u25e6) and (133.3\u25e6, 60.4\u25e6).\nThe data have been integrated over the periods when the an-\ntenna was stationary in each direction.

The field-of-view at 90 km is approximately\n200\u00d7200 km. The locations of the beams relevant for this\nstudy are shown in Fig. 2. The fundamental temporal resolu-\ntion is 1 s.\nIn Case 1, 557.7 nm intensities are taken from the Dig-\nital All-Sky Imager (DASI) at Skibotn, Norway (69.35\u25e6 N,\n20.36\u25e6 E; Kosch et al., 1998a). DASI records a 557.7 nm\nimage every 10 s with a 10 s integration time and processed\nin realtime into a 10\u00d710 km grid at an assumed height of\n100 km. In Case 2, 557.7 nm intensities are taken from the\nDigital All-Sky Imager Mk. 2 (DASI2), located at the EIS-\nCAT site at Ramfjordmoen. DASI2 uses almost the same op-\ntics as DASI, but includes a filter-wheel and an efficient back-\nilluminated CCD detector. In normal operations, a 256\u00d7256\npixel 557.7 nm image is taken every 15 s with an integration\ntime of 1 s. At 100 km altitude, the resolution is approxi-\nmately 1\u00d71 km at the zenith which is similar to the cross-\nsection of the EISCAT radar beam.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/3831\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 3831\u20133840, 2008\n3834 A. Senior et al.: Comparison of conductance determinations\n3.2 Data processing\nSince electron precipitation is geomagnetic field-aligned, it\nmakes sense to compare measurements along the same mag-\nnetic field line as closely as possible. Due to the different\ninstrument locations and look-directions, this was achieved\napproximately as follows.\nThe reference field-line was defined as the one on which\nthe EISCAT radar beam intersected an altitude of 110 km.\nThis height was chosen as intermediate between the Ped-\nersen and Hall conductance layers. The location of this\nintersection was then found in AACGM co-ordinates (for-\nmerly PACE; Baker and Wing, 1989). In this system, all\npoints on the same field line have the same latitude and lon-\ngitude. The 557.7 nm and CNA images were transformed\ninto AACGM co-ordinates assuming a typical altitude for\nthe 557.7 nm emission of 100 km (Kosch et al., 1998b) and a\ntypical altitude for the absorbing layer of 90 km (Hargreaves,\n1969). The images were then linearly interpolated to the co-\nordinates of the field-line previously defined. In fact, since\nthe geomagnetic field is inclined only about 12\u25e6 to the ver-\ntical, the horizontal alignment error in using geographic co-\nordinates instead of AACGM would only be 4 km between\nthe nominal conductance and CNA altitudes, smaller than the\nresolution of IRIS and DASI.\nMatching of the data in time was achieved by integrating\nthe camera and riometer measurements over each radar inte-\ngration period. In the case of DASI2, where the image inte-\ngration time is much less than the interval between images,\nthis means that the integration does not take place over the\ncomplete radar integration period.\nIn Case 1, the 557.7 nm intensities were scaled up by a\nfactor of 2.8. Without this scaling, the K98 method gave\nPedersen conductance estimates that agreed closely in the\nshape of the time series, but were too small in magnitude\ncompared to the radar-derived values. Additionally, the K01\nmethod underestimated the characteristic energy and hence\nthe Hall\/Pedersen conductance ratio (the individual conduc-\ntance estimates were also incorrect) compared to the radar.\nThis single scaling factor, applied to the entire Case 1 data\nset, corrected this problem. The need for this scaling is not\nfully understood, but possibly there was a calibration prob-\nlem with the DASI instrument at this time. A comparison\nof stellar intensities in an adjacent white-light imager be-\ntween Case 1 and another night with clear sky showed no\nsignificant difference, suggesting that thin cloud was not to\nblame. This discrepancy does not seem to have been found\nby Ashrafi et al. (2005) who looked at data before and af-\nter the date in question which suggests it was a temporary\nproblem. No such scaling was required in Case 2 which uses\nthe newer DASI2 instrument for which the calibration had\nrecently been determined using both stellar intensities and\nradioluminescent sources with good agreement.\nThe EISCAT plasma parameters were used to calculate\nthe Hall and Pedersen conductivities and these were height-\nintegrated over the altitude range 92\u2013200 km to give the cor-\nresponding conductances in the manner described by Senior\net al. (2007). The 557.7 nm intensities and CNA were used\nto estimate the conductances according to the three methods\nunder test.\nThere are a number of possible sources of error in the data.\nRandom error in the radar measurements contributes to ran-\ndom error in the conductances. The contribution to this from\nthe error in the electron density is easy to assess. In Case 1,\nfor the Hall conductance, 57% (96%) of points have errors\nless than 1% (5%); for the Pedersen conductance the corre-\nsponding proportions are 84% and 100% and for the conduc-\ntance ratio, 38% and 96%. In Case 2, the proportions are\n0% and 97% for the Hall conductance; 0% and 99% for the\nPedersen conductance and 0% and 95% for the ratio. The er-\nrors are sufficiently small that one-standard-error error-bars\non the plots are almost invisible, except for a few cases in\nthe conductance ratio. Here, only the error bars for the ratio\nare presented. These error estimates are all underestimates\nbecause the contribution to the error from the uncertainty in\nthe temperature measurements, which is more complicated\nto assess, is not included.\nBesides random errors, there may also be systematic er-\nrors. Firstly, as the radar beam was not always directed field-\naligned and the 557.7 nm emission and CNA do not come\nfrom thin layers at fixed heights, there are ambiguities in the\nspatial correspondence of the measurements. Secondly, tem-\nporal ambiguities can arise because the quantities measured\nby the different instruments have different response time con-\nstants to changes in the precipitating particle flux. Thirdly,\nthere can be systematic errors in the radar data analysis due\nto assumptions such as the ion composition being incorrect.\nThe latter can also affect the calculation of the conductances.\nFurthermore, as the radar coverage stops at about 92 km al-\ntitude, the Hall conductance may be underestimated as the\nHall conductance region can extend below this altitude.\n3.3 Case 1: 8\/9 March 1999\nFigure 3 shows the observations from 8\/9 March 1999\n(18:30\u201303:00). All times herein are in UT unless other-\nwise stated. The geomagnetic Kp indicies during the period\nwere 2+ (18:00 UT), 4+ (21:00 UT), 4\u2212 (00:00 UT) and 4\n(03:00 UT). Although the underlying 557.7 nm intensity and\nCNA data are not shown in the figure, the 557.7 nm intensity\npeaked at 10.3 kR at 21:16 and had a minimum of 68 R at\n21:48. The CNA peak was 3.7 dB at 22:10 and the minimum\nwas \u22120.2 dB at 18:43. Gaps in all the time series (more ev-\nident in Case 2) are due to radar transmitter outages. Since\nthe CNA and 557.7 nm intensity data were integrated over the\nactual radar data integrations, an absence of radar data leads\nto an absence of all data. Other blank spaces in the electron\ndensity plot are due to the radar analysis software failing to\nfit the plasma parameters to the measurement. Additional\nAnn.

The 557.7 nm emission shows\nsome discrete structure of a similar scale-size to the IRIS\nbeams. The electron density profiles are enhanced mainly\nin the 100\u2013150 km interval with occasional enhancements to\nhigher altitudes. Here, the S07 method estimates the conduc-\ntances and their ratio quite well, but the K01 method overes-\ntimates the Hall and particularly the Pedersen conductances.\nFinally the image at 01:53:40 was taken near the peak of\nthe first conductance enhancement in interval D. Images cov-\nering the full camera field-of-view (not shown) show that the\nbright emission is associated with an \u201comega band\u201d structure\n(Opgenoorth et al., 1983) of which successive waves cause\nthe two enhancements in interval D.

Senior et al.: Comparison of conductance determinations 3837\nIn interval A, there is a series of diminishing conduc-\ntance enhancements. The K01 method estimates these well,\nwhereas the S07 method greatly underestimates the first one,\nprogressively getting better during the interval. The image\nat 20:23:20 is close to the peak of the first enhancement.\nIt shows a mixture of discrete arc structures and more dif-\nfuse emission. The image at 20:48:05 is close to the end of\nthe interval where the conductance is diminishing. It shows\nthat the IRIS beams view a region of diffuse emission with a\nsteady gradient across the beams.\nThe image at 21:37:35 is close to the peak of the conduc-\ntance enhancement in interval B. It shows that an east-west\narc lies close to magnetic zenith, covering one beam of IRIS\nbut only grazing the other. The arc is particularly intense in\na narrow (\u223c6 km) strip on its poleward edge. This strip is\nmuch narrower than the IRIS beam dimensions. In this inter-\nval, the S07 method completely fails to estimate the large en-\nhancement in conductivity associated with this arc. The K01\nmethod performs well for the Hall conductance but overes-\ntimates the Pedersen conductance by about a factor of two.\nNeither the S07 nor the K01 methods correctly estimate the\nenhancement in the conductance ratio.\nThe image at 22:48:05 occurs near the start of interval C.\nSimilarly to the end of interval A, the IRIS beams view an\narea of diffuse emission. The electron density profile at this\ntime is similar in shape to that at the end of interval A. Here,\nthe K01 method performs well for the conductances and is\nreasonable for their ratio. The S07 method slightly underes-\ntimates the conductances and overestimates their ratio.\nAs in Case 1, the K98 method performs very well through-\nout the whole interval. Recall that in Case 2 no scaling was\napplied to the 557.7 nm intensities.\n4 Discussion\nFirstly, explanations for the discrepancies between the results\nof methods under test and the EISCAT-derived conductances\nare considered, followed by a statistical summary of the per-\nformance of the methods.\n4.1 Shape of the precipitating electron spectrum\nA common feature in both cases 1 (intervals A and D) and\n2 (interval A) is a tendency for the S07 method to underesti-\nmate the conductances and to overestimate their ratio during\nperiods when soft precipitation is present, as indicated by en-\nhanced electron densities at higher altitudes (above 150 km).\nEnhanced Pedersen and Hall conductances and CNA corre-\nspond to enhanced precipitating electron fluxes in the ap-\nproximate energy bands 2\u201310, 5\u201350 and >20 keV, respec-\ntively. There is thus considerable overlap between the bands\nenhancing the Hall conductance and CNA, but if there is\npreferential enhancement to the soft end of the spectrum, the\nHall conductance may be enhanced without further enhance-\n102 103 104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n1010\n1011\nEnergy (eV)\nFl\nux\n (m\n\u2212\n2  \ns\u2212\n1  \ne\nV\u2212\n1 )\n1999\u221203\u221208 18:53:40\n1999\u221203\u221208 22:59:15\n2006\u221211\u221223 20:23:20\n2006\u221211\u221223 20:30:30\n2006\u221211\u221223 22:43:40\nFig. 5. Precipitating electron energy spectra derived from the EIS-\nCAT electron density profiles at the times shown. Error bars on each\ncurve indicate the one standard error bound.\nment of CNA. The situation for the Pedersen conductance is\neven clearer as there is no significant overlap in energy band\nwith CNA. Therefore, enhanced soft precipitation leads to an\nunderestimate of conductances by the S07 method because\nthe CNA contains no information on the soft part of the spec-\ntrum. The Hall\/Pedersen conductance ratio is overestimated\nfor a similar reason.\nFigure 5 shows precipitating electron spectra derived from\nthe EISCAT electron density profiles using the method of\nSemeter and Kamalabadi (2005). The error estimates were\nproduced by running the inversion 40 times for each input\ndensity profile, randomly varying the densities within the er-\nror estimates provided by the radar analysis and taking the\nstandard deviation of the resulting fluxes in each energy bin.\nSystematic errors could result from the neutral atmosphere\nmodel used (MSISE-90) or the effective recombination co-\nefficient, which was taken as the empirical form of Vickrey\net al. (1982). The CNA was nearly the same at the three times\nshown for Case 2 (23 November 2006), giving the same esti-\nmate of the conductances by the S07 method, but the conduc-\ntances derived from the electron density profiles are quite dif-\nferent. The discrepancy between the two estimates becomes\nless at each successive time until they agree closely for the\nfinal case at 22:43:40. In the first case (20:23:20) the density-\nderived conductances greatly exceed the S07 estimate. The\nspectrum for this time shows a strong peak in flux at 10 keV\nwhich should lead to enhancement of both the Hall and Ped-\nersen conductances, but is too soft to greatly enhance the ab-\nsorption. Indeed, at the higher energies (>20 keV) the flux\nis much closer to that in the other two cases. The final case\n(22:43:40) shows only a small local flux maximum around\n4 keV so that the conductances are relatively less enhanced\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/3831\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 3831\u20133840, 2008\n3838 A. Senior et al.: Comparison of conductance determinations\ncompared to the CNA. The middle case (20:30:30) is inter-\nmediate both in the discrepancy between the estimates and in\nthe shape of the spectrum. There is a clear local flux maxi-\nmum around 7 keV but the high-energy tail looks rather sim-\nilar to that of the final case but with a higher flux. Note that\nas the UHF radar measurements stop at \u223c92 km altitude, the\nfull extent of the height interval and hence energy range rel-\nevant to CNA is not covered by the data.\nAs the S07 method is a statistical model, one would expect\nto find times where overestimation occurs too. Examples of\nthis are around 18:53 and 22:59 in Case 1. At these times,\nboth the S07 and K01 methods overestimate the Hall con-\nductance and Hall\/Pedersen ratio but are somewhat closer for\nthe Pedersen conductance. Electron spectra for these times\nare shown in Fig. 5 and are very similar. Overall, the fluxes\nare lower than in the examples from Case 2, but the notable\nfeature is the steeper fall off in flux above the local peak at\n\u223c5 keV. This would tend to result in less enhancement of the\nHall conductance than would be the case for the spectrum\nshapes of the Case 2 examples.\n4.2 Limited spatial resolution\nIn interval B in Case 2 (Fig. 4), an arc with an intense nar-\nrow edge passed through the radar beam revealing a strong\nenhancement of the conductances. The 557.7 nm emission\nwas strongly enhanced and the K98 method reproduced the\nPedersen conductance rather well. However, the S07 method\nfailed to reproduce the enhancement and the K01 method\ngreatly overestimated the Pedersen conductance. The com-\nmon factor between S07 and K01 is the CNA. It is clear from\nthe 557.7 nm images that the arc has a thickness which is\nsmall compared to the IRIS beams and the poleward beam\nis almost completely in a region of no emission. If the CNA\nhas a similar morphology, it is not surprising that IRIS shows\nlittle response in this case, even though the CNA could be lo-\ncally strong in the arc. The spatial scale of the CNA measure-\nment will almost integrate away the localised enhancement.\nThis underestimate of CNA is consistent with the underesti-\nmate by the S07 method.\nThe observed 557.7 nm intensity at 21:37:35 was 39 kR\nand the CNA was 0.09 dB. The radar-derived Hall conduc-\ntance was 82 S and the Pedersen conductance 30 S. The cor-\nresponding K01 estimates are 75 and 59 S, respectively. It\ncan be shown that if the CNA had been 2 dB, the K01\nmethod would estimate the conductances as 6H=81 S and\n6P=30 S, so that the Hall conductance estimate is only\nslightly reduced whereas the Pedersen conductance is greatly\nreduced and matches the radar-derived value. Hence an un-\nderestimate of CNA due to having too-large a measurement\nscale could account for the failure of the K01 method in this\ncase.\n4.3 Other issues\nIn interval B of Case 1, all three methods overestimate the\nHall and Pedersen conductances, though the S07 method es-\ntimates their ratio quite well. Pi2 pulsations observed by the\nSAMNET magnetometer array (Yeoman et al., 1990) indi-\ncate a substorm onset just prior to 21:45, the start of inter-\nval B. In the DASI images (not shown except for 22:04 in\nFig. 3), the 557.7 nm emission is strongest to the equator-\nward edge of the field-of-view. Over interval B, the more\nintense 557.7 nm emission progresses poleward, but does not\nreach the EISCAT field-of-view until after interval B. DASI\nhas a rather limited dynamic range (8 bits) and the intensifier\ngain is adjusted in realtime to compensate for this. A con-\nsequence is that when bright emission is present, the gain is\nreduced, effectively raising the noise level. It seems likely\nthat the overestimate by K98 towards the end of interval B\nis a result of this effect. Regarding the IRIS CNA mea-\nsurements, the CNA at the end of the interval was very low\n(\u223c0.1 dB) which is comparable to the error in the quiet-day\ncosmic noise power estimate (Senior et al., 2007).\nIn interval C of Case 1, the K01 method overestimates\nthe Hall and Pedersen conductances yet estimates their ra-\ntio well. The origin of this behaviour can be traced to low\nvalues of CNA which fluctuate around zero; although it is\nunphysical, CNA can be negative as a result of an inaccurate\nestimate of the quiet-day noise power. An analysis of the K01\nmethod shows that as the CNA approaches zero, so does the\nestimate of the characteristic energy. At the same time, the\nestimate of the integral number flux tends to infinity. If the\nCNA is zero or negative, the results become undefined. It is\nthe delicate balance of this behaviour as the CNA tends to\nzero which leads to the large fluctuations, particularly in the\nPedersen conductance estimate in interval C. However, since\nthe conductance ratio depends only on the characteristic en-\nergy estimate which is well-behaved even for zero CNA, the\nratio estimate is also well-behaved. The gaps in the line for\nthe K01 method correspond to those points where the CNA\nis zero or negative.\n4.4 Statistical performance of the methods\nTable 1 gives the Pearson correlation coefficients between the\nconductance parameter estimates from the EISCAT measure-\nments and from the three methods under test. It is clear that\nthe K98 method performs best for the Pedersen conductance\n(although the K01 method is only slightly worse) and that the\nK01 method performs best for the Hall conductance. For the\nHall\/Pedersen conductance ratio, the S07 method seems to\nhave an advantage over the K01 method, although in Case 1\nthis is only slight. The general good performance of the\nK01 method is probably a result of the combined use of the\n557.7 nm intensity and CNA, which allows both the energy\nand flux of the precipitation to be estimated.\nAnn.

Senior et al.: Comparison of conductance determinations 3839\nIn Case 1, the different radar look directions allow the\nvariation in the performance of the methods with look di-\nrection to be explored. A comparison of the correlation coef-\nficients for the results of the three methods with the EISCAT-\nderived conductances for each of the four radar look direc-\ntions showed that at the 95% confidence level, there was\nno significant difference between radar look directions. For\nIRIS, the four directions correspond to approximate angles of\n25\u25e6\u201352\u25e6 off magnetic zenith; for DASI the range is 2\u25e6\u201334\u25e6\nand for the radar itself, the range is 0\u25e6\u201323\u25e6. It is not possi-\nble to conclude that the performance of the methods under\ntest is relatively unaffected by angle off zenith, at least up to\nthe limits observed, because field-aligned reference measure-\nments of the conductances are not available at each location,\nbut at least the methods become no worse than the case of\na non field-aligned radar measurement. Comparing the cor-\nrelation coefficients with the results of Case 2 (Table 1) also\nsuggested that the results are no worse (in fact sometimes\nbetter) than for the case where both the radar and imager have\nfield-aligned look directions.\n4.5 Improvements to the methods\nThe S07 method performs relatively poorly compared to the\nK01 and K98 methods, but this is hardly surprising when\none quantity (CNA) is used to describe a system with more\nthan one degree of freedom (the precipitating electron spec-\ntrum). Adding a second measurement as in the K01 method\nbrings a considerable improvement. Surprisingly, the K98\nmethod, also based on a single quantity, estimates another\nsingle quantity, the Pedersen conductance, remarkably well.\nThe joint performance of the K01 and K98 methods suggests\nthat there is little room for improvement to the basic method\nwhen instrumental effects such as spatial resolution and esti-\nmation of the riometer quiet-day level are taken away.\nTemporal resolution was not investigated in this study, but\nmodern optical imagers and riometers have good temporal\nresolution, comparable to or finer than the recombination\ntime of the plasma at the altitudes of the conductance lay-\ners. Therefore the data should allow short timescale changes\nin conductance to be monitored, although the methods might\nrequire some adaptation to account for non-equilibrium ef-\nfects.\n5 Conclusions\nThe cases studied here allow the following conclusions to be\ndrawn about the three methods tested:\n1. The S07 method underestimates conductances when\nsoft precipitation is present, for example inside auroral\narcs. Overestimation is seen in some circumstances in\ndiffuse aurora, depending on the detail of the precipitat-\ning electron spectrum.\nTable 1. Pearson correlation coefficients between the conductance\nparameter estimates from EISCAT and from the three methods un-\nder test. The upper number in each case is for Case 1, the lower\nnumber is for Case 2.\nParameter K98 K01 S07\n6H 0.98 0.87\n0.97 0.63\n6P 0.96 0.90 0.71\n0.97 0.88 0.55\n6H \/6P 0.70 0.78\n0.56 0.73\n2. Despite the above, the S07 method provided the best\nestimates of the Hall\/Pedersen conductance ratio.\n3. The K01 method provided the best estimates of the Hall\nconductance.\n4. The K98 method provided the best estimates of the Ped-\nersen conductance.\n5. Insufficient spatial (and presumably temporal) resolu-\ntion in the measurements can lead to serious errors in\nthe conductance estimates.\n6. There is no evidence for a deterioration in the perfor-\nmance of the methods at least up to magnetic zenith an-\ngles of \u223c20\u25e6. This is a conservative estimate based on\nthe maximum magnetic zenith angle of the radar mea-\nsurement.\nIt is worth noting that the results show that when the esti-\nmation of \u201cbulk\u201d parameters such as the conductances are\nrequired, as opposed to height-resolved conductivities or the\nspectrum of precipitating particles, good results can be ob-\ntained using only one or two ground-based measurements.\nAcknowledgements.
