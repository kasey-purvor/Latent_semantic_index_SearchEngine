This is the true mea-\nsure of what terrorism may achieve. It is for\nParliament to decide whether to give the terrorists\nsuch a victory.1\nIntroduction\nFeeling safe does not seem to go hand in hand with\nliberty. An important balancing exercise ensues when\nsteps are taken by the state to respond to a perceived\nthreat to national security and, at the same time, ensure\nthat in acting in the interests of society to answer these\nthreats, basic civil liberties are not undermined. Con-\ncerning this delicate and fraught process, Gross and Ni\nAola\u00b4in aptly observe:\n\u2018Balancing \u2013 taking into consideration the threats,\ndangers, and risks that need to be met, the probabil-\nity of their occurrence, and the costs for society and\nits members of meeting those risks in different\nways \u2013 may be thus heavily biased, even when\napplied with the best of intentions.\u2019 (2007, p. 74)\nDevelopments since 9\/11 have resulted in the systematic\nmodification of laws by governments keen to respond to\nterrorism and which take discretionary forms of execu-\ntive powers. In the United Kingdom and the United\nStates, for example, a series of laws, pre-emptive in nat-\nure and, as such, highly problematic, have been passed\nby legislatures and challenged in the courts.2\nScholars are once again compelled to ponder the\nquestions concerning the law and its legitimacy.\nViewing these questions as integral to the rule of law\nand democracy, they are especially concerned with\nrecent government action that seemingly rejects the\nvalues of the rule of law and that simultaneously raises\ndoubts about the nature of democracy (Scheuerman,\n2006). Yet, the \u2018relationship between the rule of law\nand democracy is asymmetrical: the rule of law can\nexist without democracy, but democracy needs the\nrule of law, for otherwise democratically established\nlaws may be eviscerated at the stage of application by\nnot being followed\u2019 (Tamanaha, 2004: 37).\nDavid Dyzenhaus\u2019s work is all about assembling the\npieces of this jigsaw puzzle together. Whether writing\nabout the South African experience, or emergency provi-\nsions and the unwritten constitution, he is a meticulous\nscholar who revisits the main theories in public law as\nhe discusses key cases and critiques judicial reasoning\nrelating to emergency powers (Dyzenhaus, 1999).\nDyzenhaus is not impressed by half-hearted judicial\ncommitment to the rule of law. In this recent publi-\ncation, The Constitution of Law, he painstakingly scruti-\nnises a government\u2019s accountability when responding to\nemergencies and terrorism. Dyzenhaus is not dismissive\nof judicial responsibility in this response. He revives and\ndraws our attention to the Hobbesian notion of a judge\nwho is sensitive to dangers when the rule of law, which\n\u2018secures the fabric of civil society, is under strain\u2019 (2007, p. 12,\nmy emphasis).\n1 Lord Hoffmann, A v.

Gearty correctly identifies three critical\nparadoxes that lie at the heart of this strain, namely:\nnational security, democracy and political violence.\nOne of the reasons for the tension is the \u2018misuse of\nlanguage in our political culture\u2019 (2007, p. 111).\nTerrorism, for example, has been, and continues to be,\nan uncertain term. This ambiguity and the \u2018creative\nexploitation\u2019 of the paradoxes allow for measures to be\nadopted that are \u2018exceptional and unprecedented [. . .] to\ndefend [the nation]\u2019 (p. 119). As a civil libertarian, Gearty is\nespecially eager to maintain the \u2018emancipatory and radi-\ncal nature of civil liberties\u2019, urging us to embrace the\ndemocratic developments of the twentieth century, and\nrecall our commitment to the rule of law and human\nrights (p. 111).\nDyzenhaus is especially preoccupied with \u2018legal\nspaces\u2019 and \u2018legal controls\u2019. He identifies black holes\nwhich comprise a space absent legal controls and grey\nholes which constitute a space in which there are legal\ncontrols, but they are inadequate. Grey holes provide a\nsemblance of legality and give government a basis to\nargue that it is still governing in accordance with the\nrule of law. It is the grey holes that worry Dyzenhaus\nmost. They are, he says, black in substance and, therefore,\neven more dangerous for the rule of law than black holes.\nFor Dyzenhaus, therefore, the objective is to discover\nways out of the grey holes: \u2018ways of responding to terror\nin ways that break out of this insecurity-heightening,\ndemocracy-corroding spiral\u2019 (Loader and Walker, 2007,\np. 90). Throughout, Dyzenhaus refers to the \u2018rule-of-law\u2019\nproject, in which judges play a key role and make their\ncommitments explicit.\nTo appreciate Dyzenhaus\u2019s concerns, this essay revi-\nsits the notion of an \u2018open society\u2019, which emerged in\n1989 with the collapse of Communist political structures\nin the Eastern bloc. Immense changes in both western\nand, in particular, central and eastern Europe, revived\nquestions about the highly contested notion of the rule\nof law. Indeed, it was the abuses inherent in \u2018closed\nsocieties\u2019 or totalitarian regimes which were the founda-\ntions of the open society. This does, of course, ask us to\nbear in mind the context within which developments\ntake place. Inspiration in post-1989 Europe was taken\nfrom European and international developments, as well\nas from more established democracies. It is worthwhile to\nremind ourselves of the sources of the catalysts which\nmake the rule of law meaningful. Exploring further\nDyzenhaus\u2019s notion of the unwritten constitution, the\nessay examines the concept of the \u2018invisible constitution\u2019.\nThis notion was first introduced by the energetic and\nfar-reaching efforts of post-Communist courts, and is\none that provides useful insight into Dyzenhaus\u2019s well-\nresearched, engaging and prescient work.\nOpen society\nThe idea of an \u2018open society\u2019 is one that is strongly\nconnected to the rule of law. \u2018Open society\u2019 specifically\nrefers to liberal democracies that are tolerant and that\nadopt transparent and flexible political measures.\nPopper, writing in 1945, defined an open society as\none in which political leaders can be overthrown with-\nout the need for bloodshed (1945\/1995). Significantly,\nthe distinction between an open and closed society\nrested with the recognition of the role of responsibility\nand accountability for personal choices. Popper was\nreferring to clear violations of civil liberties and free-\ndoms that occurred in a \u2018closed society\u2019, or totalitarian\nregime. At the heart of the legal system that was imp-\nosed on Communist states was fear. \u2018Fear was the first\nprinciple buttressing Soviet-style control. A key to com-\nmunist societies\u2019 stability was the well-internalised fear\nof the party-state and its seemingly omnipresent secur-\nity forces\u2019 (\u0141os\u00b4 2002, p. 169).\nIn a closed society, liberty does not rank very high\nwhen compared to security. Laws are instrumental, far\nfrom static, and their arbitrary application ensures that\nsociety feels their reach in both public and private lives.\nSome features of the totalitarian regime support the use\nof terror for achieving the long-term goal of eliminating\nany political opposition to the state order. For the post-\nCommunist world, the agreement that human rights\nshould be protected unconditionally was accompanied\nby selected models of rule of law from more established\ndemocracies. Although later criticised for being naive,\none could find little fault with the passion, enthusiasm\nand belief in that a judiciary which boasts \u2018confidence in\nthe men and women who administer the judicial system\nthat is the true backbone of the rule of law\u2019 could be\ncreated (Scheppele, 2000).3 It is not in the scope of this\nessay to examine the complexities of judicial systems in\ntransition, suffice it to say that \u2018Communist ideas, pat-\nterns of behaviour and institutions still pervade consti-\ntutional developments\u2019 (Sajo\u00b4, 1995, p. 253). Equally,\nDyzenhaus also draws on similar experiences, namely\nthe South African one, to demonstrate that judges in\nboth open and closed societies have an obligation to\nthe rule-of-law project. The judge in an open society\n3 Even it seems, after a \u2018bad\u2019 decision. See Bush v. Gore 121 US 525, 539 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting), at the US\nSupreme Court site at www.supremecourtus.gov (28 June 2007).\nB OO K R E V I E WS390\nshould be sensitive to the project at all times, none more\nso than in times of political instability.\nFear also is, unfortunately, a dreadful feature of\nour open society. In an extreme form of insecurity,\nanxiety and vulnerability we feel impotent and help-\nless. Our helplessness hinders us from finding those\nsolutions that \u2018could allow our politics to be lifted to\nthe level where power has already settled, so enabling\nus to recapture and repossess control over forces shap-\ning our shared condition\u2019 and defining the variety of\nchoices and boundaries to our freedom (Baumann, 2006,\np. 128). This is a particular concern for civil libertarians,\nwho find that \u2018[a] tranquil state rooted in fear is not a free\nsociety\u2019 (Gearty, 2007, p. 119). Baumann notes:\n\u2018If the idea of an \u2018\u2018open society\u2019\u2019 originally stood for\nthe self-determination of a free society proud of its\nopenness, it now brings to most minds the terrify-\ning experience of heteronomous, vulnerable popu-\nlations overwhelmed by forces they neither\ncontrol nor truly understand, horrified by their\nown undefendability and obsessed with security\nof their borders and of the population inside\nthem \u2013 since it is precisely the security inside\nborders and of borders that eludes their grasp and\nseems bound to stay beyond their reach forever.\u2019\n(Baumann, 2006, pp. 96\u201397).\nIn an attempt to address our fears we naturally turn to the\nstate to maintain law and order. Accompanying the fear\nthat affects liberal democracies is the challenge that\nstates undertake new and unusual methods to disci-\npline and punish. Following 9\/11, the concern related\nto these unique measures increased, causing certain\nscholars to question political motives, and pondering\nwhether \u2018we currently allow practices that go against\ntheir original meaning\u2019 (Kateb, 2006, p. 47). In a similar\nvein, Baumann observes that the \u2018plight of \u2018stranger\u2019,\ncast and held in disturbingly underdefined \u2018grey zone\u2019\nstretching between declared enemies and trusted\nfriends, has been at all times ambivalence incarnate\u2019\n(2006, p. 126).4 However, it is equally important to\nnote that for some scholars, such as Richardson, there\nare doubts concerning \u2018a great evolutionary leap in\nSeptember 2001, that the human race suddenly produced\na new brand of evildoers\u2019 (2006, p. 13, my emphasis).\nTerrorism is not a new phenomenon; governments\nthrough time have had to create legal responses to\nviolent movements within their borders. \u2018We must\nalways remember, however, that terrorists cannot derail\nour democracy by planting a bomb in our midst. Our\ndemocracy can be derailed only if we conclude that it is\ninadequate to protect us\u2019 (p. 280).\nThe crux of the question rests with essence of the\nregime itself. The separation of powers and judicial\nreview are two mechanisms to ensure government\nresponsibility. These mechanisms have been critically\nanalysed by scholars of public law, seeking an answer\nabout the controlling national power. Tushnet (2005),\nfor example, rejects both mechanisms, while others in\nthe area painstakingly analyse key case law to reveal\njudicial commitment to the constitutive elements of\nthe legal authority, exploring the manner in which\nprecedent allows judges to rise to challenges to the\nrule of law (Scheppele, 2000; Scheuerman, 2006).\nDyzenhaus reveals a different problematic that is\nnot isolated to the United Kingdom or the Common-\nwealth. It is the claim that since 9\/11 we have moved into\na state of permanent emergency and have abandoned or\nare slowly abandoning the rule of law. As noted above,\ntension between national security interests and protect-\ning civil liberties can be identified in many states\u2019 his-\ntories at different points in time. Ironically, our open\nsociety is experiencing a crisis with the very issues that\ncomprise its beginnings. It is equally ironic that compar-\nisons are drawn with the experiences that constitute the\ninception of the open society. Paradoxically, while we\nlive in an open society, it is seemingly threatened by fear.\nAnd because the fear is not entirely tangible, it appears\neven more menacing and more demanding of a solution.\nThose living in the most developed countries are\nliving in the most secure societies which ever existed, yet\nat the same time we reveal obsessions about security-\nrelated issues, linked to anxiety and fear (Baumann,\n2006, p. 101). Polls taken after the 9\/11 and London\nterrorist attacks support this contention. \u2018True to its\nname, the paramount weapon of terrorism is sowing\nterror\u2019 (p. 107). It is asserted that we are dealing with a\ndifferent kind of terrorism, one that is \u2018new\u2019 and has a\n\u2018more ominous face [. . .] in Europe\u2019 (Baumann, 2006,\np. 108; Cowell and Bonner, 2007).5 Counter-terrorist\n4 For example, concerning the United States, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released a\nreport recently that outlines 2,467 incidents and experiences of anti-Muslim violence, discrimination and\nharassment in 2006, the highest number of civil rights cases ever recorded in the Washington-based group\u2019s\nreport. See the full report (of its kind) at www.cair.com\/pdf\/2007-Civil-Rights-Report.pdf.\n5 The recent attack on Glasgow airport has provoked remarks reported by the US and British press, referring to\nthe \u2018psychotic thought processes behind the attack\u2019, or \u2018it is clear a loose but deadly network of interlinked\noperational cells has developed\u2019 (Cowell and Bonner, 2007).\nB OO K RE V I E W S 391\nmeasures are \u2018openly and blatantly desecularized ver-\nsion[s] of the totalitarian temptations that accompa-\nnied the whole of modern history, being tested with\nparticular zeal and to most spectacular effect by the\ncommunist and fascist movements of the century that\nhas just drawn to its close\u2019 (Baumann, 2006, p. 115). As\npointed out by Gross and Ni Aola\u00b4in, \u2018[t]he rush to\nlegislate means that it is not unusual that when emer-\ngency legislation is initially adopted, no meaningful\ndebates over it take place\u2019 (2007, p. 72). All of this seems\nto paint a gloomy picture indeed, especially when we\nconsider Rosen\u2019s observation that we are not very good\nat digesting complicated information, making us more\nimpatient to make good decisions about complex\nissues (2004, p. 15). This is particularly relevant when\nwe are driven by a \u2018psychology of fear\u2019 (p. 14). Thus, in the\ncurrent context, our rush to apprehend terrorists and\nprevent future terrorist attacks has meant that our\nrespective governments have taken far-reaching steps\nthat potentially violate fundamental rights and freedoms\nand call into question the balancing exercise between\nnational security and the protection of civil liberties.\nThe future of the open society\nIn maintaining law and order, it is clear that the state\nmay decide to introduce and impose extraordinary mea-\nsures. For some, liberal democracies are always in a state\nof vulnerability to this inevitable development. Carl\nSchmitt, writing in the early twentieth century, reflected\non events in Weimar Germany (1919\u20131933), and argued\nthat traditional political and legal thought does not\naddress the problem of exception, which is composed\nof an extreme danger to the existing political and legal\norder. Schmitt\u2019s work comprises an important part of\nDyzenhaus\u2019s critique (and others working in the area) of\nlegal spaces. For Schmitt, it is not clear what measures\nshould be taken, but what is clear is that not every legal\nnorm can foresee, let alone contain, what measure might\nbe required. Schmitt found liberal-minded proponents of\nthis form of government naive (1922).\nIt is easy to forget that under the 1919 Weimar\nconstitution constitutional rights were not entrenched.\nDiscussions relating to constitutional rights occurred\nwithin a different context, led by positivists who\nstressed the idea of the \u2018people\u2019 rather than the indivi-\ndual (Fuzer, 2004, p. 135). This meant that the:\n\u2018German people\u2019s sovereignty was always present in\nthe electorate\u2019s votes in plebiscites, in parliamentary\nand presidential elections, outlining the contours\nof a parliament in which a vast legislative and\nexecutive powers were to combine and which\nonly a few \u2018\u2018checks and balances\u2019\u2019 were to counter.\u2019\n(Fuzer, 2004, p. 135)\nIn contrast, during this time, and in response\nto developments in Weimar Germany, Kelsen went\nfurther with his positivism, or the \u2018pure theory of law\u2019,\nwhere the freedom of the people, as part of the state,\nwas most important of all. The application of any\nnorms beyond legal and positive ones was out of the\nquestion. Not surprisingly, natural law interpretations\nwere rejected. As Dyzenhaus notes, \u2018the state is totally\nconstituted by law\u2019 (2007, p. 199), so when a political\nentity acts outside the law, its acts cannot be attributed\nto the state and they have no authority. Interestingly,\nSchmitt, when writing about constitutional rights, held\ntwo different positions in the course of developing his\nideas. While he expanded on the political dimension of\nconstitutions early on in his career, at the centre of his\nargument basic rights and liberties could be found.\n\u2018Restriction of the individual\u2019s freedom could only\noccur as an exception and even then it had to happen\nin an assessable manner\u2019 (Fuzer, 2004, p. 208). He would\nlater change his stance to accommodate the new poli-\ntical situation.\nEqually, it easy to overlook the fact that one of the\nmost important developments in the twentieth century\nconcerns international law and the role of the interna-\ntional community. Most constitutions have provisions\non states of emergency that also protect civil liberties\nand require constant parliamentary review of related\nexecutive decisions (Scheppele, 2004). This is not to\ndeny that questions continue to plague the purported\nlimitations of the rule of law and the reach of the law in\ncontrolling emergency powers. If we attempt to find\nsolutions at the European level, we are disappointed. In\nmost cases, the European Court of Human Rights has\nleft the question of emergency provisions to the states\nunder the margin of appreciation.6\nScheppele convincingly argues that we need to\nnote the historical and material circumstances that\nexisted in Weimar Germany, which resulted in the\nfailure of weak parliamentary democracies, not only\nin Germany, but throughout continental Europe \u2013\nwhich do not exist in the present day. If we pursue\nthis further and examine events during times of sta-\nbility, we discover that \u2018emergency powers are in fact\nmore interesting, politically more revealing and more\n6 Most cases concern Article 5 (personal liberty) of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Many examples can be found\nin UK and US experiences with emergency provisions\nduring peacetime. This alternative critique introduces\nanother perspective with which to view the legal spaces\nthat have been identified by scholars working the area.\nPrior to 9\/11 most terrorist offences were dealt with by\nUS federal criminal law; this meant that terrorist sus-\npects were handled by the institutions that formed part\nof the ordinary criminal justice system. In the United\nKingdom, the treatment of IRA suspects has been long\ncriticised along the lines of creating a separate criminal\nlaw framework to deal with the \u2018suspect community\u2019\n(Hillyard, 1995). The recognition and critique of these\ndevelopments warns against the temptation to discard\nor dismiss the \u2018rule-of-law\u2019 project.\nInvisible constitution\nAs noted above, Dyzenhaus supports the view of a judge\ntaking the role of a \u2018weather forecaster\u2019. He constructs a\nframework for this role after carefully examining cases\nfrom various common law jurisdictions to demonstrate\nthat the law provides a moral foundation for it. He\nalleges inconsistency in adhering to a strict application\nof the separation of powers or a principle of legality that\nasks parliament to \u2018confront what it is doing and accept\nthe political cost\u20197, saying that it reveals further divi-\nsions concerning the value of equality as it pertains to\ncitizens and non-citizens. We see evidence of the truth\nof his allegation in Canadian and Australian approaches\nwhich divulge equally alarming developments.8 For\nDyzenhaus, principles derived from lesser-known cases\ncan provide a precedent for future commitment to\nthe \u2018rule-of-law project\u2019, especially when judicial un-\ncertainty and weakness are identified. His analysis of\nthe Belmarsh decision9 is an excellent example of how\njudges have failed in their commitment despite hold-\ning the provisions in question unconstitutional. This\nis one of the most critically engaging chapters of\nDyzenhaus\u2019s book.\nDyzenhaus\u2019s unwavering position related to the\ncommitment of all three branches of government to\nthe rule of law resonates with developments in\nthe post-Communist world. The former Hungarian\nConstitutional Court president, Laszlo So\u00b4lyom, wrote\nthat \u2018[o]f all constitutional principles, the rule of\nlaw played a special, symbolic role: it represented the\nessence of the system change, being the watershed\nbetween the nondemocratic, nonconstitutional, socia-\nlist system and the new constitutional democracy\u2019\n(Scheppele, 2000; So\u00b4lyom and Brunner, 1999). So\u00b4lyom\nrefers to the Hungarian experience, where legal con-\ntinuity and legal certainty guided the transition (and\ncan be a blueprint for developments in the region). It\ncould be argued that for Dyzenhaus, such enthusiasm\nand commitment to the rule of law complements his\nidea of the rule-of-law project. He argues that his:\n\u2018conception of the rule of law is a rather bare\ncommon law one, enriched by the way in which\nsuch a conception has to be updated, most recently\nbecause of the central place taken by an interna-\ntional and domestic discourse of human rights in\nour thinking about law.\u2019 (2007, p.13)\nThe continental legal model that exists in post-\nCommunist states has experienced a similar inspira-\ntion. Contrary to some views, Hungarian courts have\nnot \u2018gone mad and forgotten wise counsel that the\nlaw should be stable and uncertain, that judicial\nreview should be used sparingly, that overconstitutio-\nnalisation of law may be too much of a good thing\u2019\n(Scheppele, 2000). The most novel way that this has\nemerged has taken the form of the \u2018invisible constitu-\ntion\u2019, which first arose in post-Communist Hungary.\nThis is not an idea that is necessarily rooted in positive\nlaw, rather, it refers to the constitutional framework\nthat the Hungarian Constitutional Court has devel-\noped without speaking about a \u2018system of values\u2019\n(So\u00b4lyom and Brunner, 1999, p. 5). Owing to important\nhistorical reasons, the Hungarian Constitution elimi-\nnated all ideological references. Incorporating a similar\napproach to German courts, the Hungarian Court\u2019s\npost-1989 jurisprudence, in the protection of consti-\ntutional rights, refers to the principle of legality\nand continuity of law as a \u2018revolution under the rule\nof law\u2019 (So\u00b4lyom and Brunner, 1999). In other words, it\nis this guiding principle that holds together the case\nlaw of the Court and the rule of law. The most power-\nful example of this can be found in the Court\u2019s reason-\ning in the case in which the death penalty was\n7 Lord Hoffmann in R v. Secretary for the Home Department, ex parte Simms [2000] 2 AC 115 at 131.\n8 See Suresh v.Canada [2002] 1 SCR 3 andAl-Kateb v.Godwin [2004] 208 ALR 124. The Canadian Supreme Court has\nbeen both hailed and criticised. A further reading reveals a commitment to the prohibition of torture but\nultimately an immigration policy that falls short of international standards (see Okafor and Okoronkwo, 2003).\n9 A v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] EWCA Civ 1502, [2004] QB 335, [2005] 2 WLR 87.\nB OO K RE V I E W S 393\nabolished.10 This landmark case lucidly argues that the\nhuman right to dignity is another key to the hidden\nconstitution. Despite being the source of controversy,\nperceived by the Hungarian parliament as judicial\nactivism and clear encroachment on the legislative\nand executive branches of power, the Court persevered\nin constructing a constitutional framework that offers\na reliable and timeless standard. It adopted the Italian\nConstitutional Court\u2019s notion of the \u2018living law\u2019, where\nthe Court, when reviewing the content of the norm,\nreviews the \u2018meaning and the content that can be\nattributed to it from the consistent and unitary practice\nof applying the law\u2019 (So\u00b4lyom and Brunner, 1999, p. 4).\nOverall, the constitution viewed in its entirety is the\nstarting point. In the Hungarian experience, the Court\u2019s\ncase law explains the theoretical bases of the Constitu-\ntion and of the rights included in it in order to form a\ncoherent system with its decisions. The construction of\nthe \u2018invisible constitution\u2019 provides a reliable standard\nof constitutionality beyond the Constitution, and\nanswers attempts to amend the document out of poli-\ntical interests. Such a coherent system, it is understood,\ndoes not conflict with a new document to be established\nat any point in the future. The Constitutional Court\nenjoys the freedom in this process, as long as it remains\nwithin the framework of the concept of constitutional-\nity (Scheppele, 2006).\nConcluding remarks\nUltimately, Dyzenhaus\u2019s work concerns judges, and\ntheir responsibility \u2013 constitutional duty \u2013 to uphold\nthe rule of law, especially when there are indications\nthat the government is withdrawing from the rule-of-\nlaw project. His earlier work on South Africa (in fact\nDyzenhaus went before the Truth and Reconciliation\nCommission to argue that judges were accountable for\nthe facilitation of secrecy and arbitrariness that charac-\nterised the apartheid system) challenges us with ques-\ntions found at the core of political philosophy when he\ndissects the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He\nadopts a similar approach in his recent work.\nHis commitment resonates with the creation of\nthe open society. Perhaps some lessons can be learned\nfrom revisiting the values upon which the open society\nwas created, when thinking about the current context in\nwhich law and its legitimacy are discussed. For Hungary\nand other states, \u2018there is a good deal of improvisation\nwhenever the musicians find the score unpleasant\u2019 (Sajo\u00b4,\n1995, p. 267) that should challenge more established\ndemocracies. While Dyzenhaus convincingly demon-\nstrates that responsibility need not be lost in times of\nemergency, in order effectively to answer and address\nthe challenge of terrorism, it is important not to ignore\nthe context within which the law operates, as well as\nthat within which terrorism operates. As noted above,\nterrorism will only fade when its sociopolitical roots are\ndestroyed, not by the punitive measures that are\nimposed (Baumann, 2006, p. 109). Likewise, scholars of\nterrorism, such as Crenshaw, note that the \u2018study of\nterrorism still lacks the foundation of extensive primary\ndata based on interviews and life histories of individuals\nengaged in terrorism\u2019 (2000, p. 405). Recently, this point\nhas been taken up by Campbell and Connolly, whose\nsociolegal-based research on Northern Ireland reveals\nthat the law plays a key role in the repression and\nmobilisation of violent challenges to the state and, inter-\nestingly, demonstrates how a legal challenge can exist in\na grey zone (2006). The rule-of-law project \u2013 the invisible\nconstitution \u2013 ensures that unconstitutionality does not\ngo unnoticed (Sajo\u00b4, 1995), even when meeting seemingly\ngood intentions defined by national security interests,\nrecalling principles related to a legal culture and legal\nconsciousness peculiar to our civil society. \u2018It is we the\npeople\u2019s dedication to a culture of legality that is the\nguardian of the constitution\u2019 (Dyzenhaus, 2007, p. 233).\nReferences\nBAUMANN, Zygmunt (2006) Liquid Fear.

On the\none hand, the language of rights has never been so\npopular. Civil society organisations constantly hoist\nthe banner of human rights in their campaigns, while\ninternational organisations refer relentlessly to the\ncentral importance of rights in their work. Legal\ninstruments that attempt to encapsulate and give bind-\ning force to human rights have become integral ele-\nments of most legal systems. Academics and activists\nconsistently try to expand the reach and scope of rights\napproaches: initially conceived as a narrow set of\nminimal guarantees to protect core human liberties,\nthe language of rights have now become a conceptual\nframework for articulating a vast range of normative\nclaims. Socioeconomic rights, equality rights, chil-\ndren\u2019s rights, cultural rights and other new varieties\nof \u2018rightspeak\u2019 have all emerged in recent decades,\nand have flourished across the globe. Human rights\nappear to be the progressive ideology of choice for our\ntimes.\nHowever, on the other hand, human rights face\nnew and growing political challenges, especially since\nB OO K RE V I E W S 395\nthe events of 9\/11. Many Western governments, partial\ncheerleaders for human rights during the Cold War,\nhave begun to kick against the constraints which\nhuman rights instruments impose on their freedom\nof action. Ironically, some Western governments also\nincreasingly use the language of human rights to jus-\ntify actions, such as the Iraq invasion, which rights\nactivists often bitterly oppose.1 This development\nreflects the ever-increasing salience of human rights\nideals, but also demonstrates the existence of real\nconflict and disagreement about their substance. In\naddition, some states, such as Russia, increasingly indi-\ncate a willingness to reject or repudiate the human\nrights package. Fundamentalist religious ideologies\nchallenge the universalist and Enlightenment-rooted\nassumptions underlying most contemporary accounts\nof rights. The predominance of neoliberal ideologies\nand increasing commodification of social goods since\n1989 has denied political oxygen to some of the narra-\ntives of human solidarity out of which elements of the\nhuman rights idea originally grew. In other words, just\nas the ideology of human rights attains significant new\nlevels of impact and support, it is attracting a backlash.\nNew debates have broken out as to who can speak in\nthe name of rights, and how the integrity of human\nrights ideals can be maintained in the midst of this\nuncertainty.2\nThe three books all reviewed here engage with\nthese issues in different ways. Gearty\u2019s Can Human\nRights Survive? is a collection of essays that were ori-\nginally presented as the 2005 Hamlyn Lectures. This\nvolume is an ambitious undertaking, and a consider-\nable contribution to the great tradition of Hamlyn\npapers. In the first chapter, Gearty attempts to identify\nwhat, if any, common, shared understanding can\nunderpin the idea of human rights in what he calls\nthe current \u2018crisis of authority\u2019, where foundational\nor metaphysical accounts of human values have\nlargely succumbed to withering critique. He argues\nthat a \u2018Darwinian\u2019 sense of shared human compassion\nis perhaps the only solid basis on which human rights\nideals can rest (pp. 40\u201350).3\nGearty then proceeds in the rest of the book to\nexamine how the \u2018legalisation\u2019 of rights (i.e. their con-\nversion into judicially enforceable legal norms) and the\nincorporation of the language of rights within the\ncurrent discourse of \u2018national security\u2019 pose a serious\nthreat to the emancipatory potential of the human\nrights idea. He sees human rights as beleaguered, resting\non shaky normative foundations and facing a life-threa-\ntening crisis in the form of the current \u2018War on Terror\u2019.\nThis book attempts to explore how this \u2018Esperanto of the\nvirtuous\u2019 can survive and thrive despite these threats, via\nthe re-emphasising of the emancipatory, participatory\nand ultimately compassionate roots of the idea of\nhuman rights. In general, this volume represents per-\nhaps Gearty\u2019s finest work: he returns to old and familiar\nthemes that have recurred throughout his work, such as\nthe dangers of the legalisation of rights and the rhetoric\nof counter-terrorism, but his analysis has deepened and\nbecome more nuanced.\nDembour, in Who Believes in Human Rights?, also\nengages with some of these themes, except that her\nfocus is primarily on the application of the rights norms\ncontained in the European Convention on Human Rights\n(ECHR) by the European Court of Human Rights (here-\nafter \u2018the Strasbourg court\u2019) in its case-law. Her admirably\nclear and focused introduction makes it clear that she\nshares Gearty\u2019s scepticism about the existence of any\nbasis of \u2018universal universality\u2019 on which to rest the\nnormative foundations of human rights ideas. However,\nher approach differs from that of Gearty, in that Dembour\ndoes not attempt to find any substitute basis for rights\nideology. She maintains a degree of suspicion about\nthe entire package of human rights ideals, while accept-\ning their potential usefulness as a form of rhetoric and\npersuasion. She explores some of the major \u2018classical\ncritiques\u2019 of human rights ideology and applies these\ncritiques to how rights are institutionalised and protected\nvia the case-law of the Strasbourg court. Dembour con-\ncludes that many of these critiques, including the realist,\nradical feminist, utilitarian, Marxist and \u2018particularist\u2019\/\nanti-universalist perspectives, have considerable validity\nwhen applied to the Strasbourg jurisprudence. The\nhuman rights case-law of the Court is riddled with nor-\nmative gaps, uncertainties and multiple instances where\nhuman rights law does not deliver on its emancipatory\npotential.\nDembour moves on from this conclusion to discuss\nthe normative and ethical limits of rights jurisprudence,\nand against this background she analyses human rights\nscholarship and how it defines the idea of rights and\n1 See the controversial views of Michael Ignatieff on the justifiability of extreme measures in certain circum-\nstances to combat terrorism, in Ignatieff (2004). See also Conor Gearty\u2019s attack on Ignatieff in response: Gearty\n(2005). Gearty develops this criticism of Ignatieff\u2019s views in Chapters 4 and 5 of Can Human Rights Survive?\n2 See Douzinas (2000).\n3 For a similar attempt to locate an alternative \u2018universal\u2019 basis for human rights, this time involving a\n\u2018commitment to the rights of strangers\u2019, see Langlois (2003).\nB OO K R E V I E WS396\nresponds to these limitations. For her, four \u2018schools\u2019 of\nhuman rights scholarship can be identified: the \u2018natural\u2019\nscholars, who see rights as inherent and \u2018given\u2019; \u2018delib-\nerative\u2019 scholars, who see rights as agreed norms settled\nby a process of social and political debate; \u2018protest\u2019\nscholars, who see rights as ideals to be fought for; and\n\u2018discourse\u2019 scholars, who see rights as indeterminate\nnorms that are consistently in the process of being\nformulated and discussed. In a very interesting analysis,\nDembour proceeds to examine the interrelationship\nbetween these different approaches to human rights.\nFor her, an approach based on \u2018human rights nihilism\u2019\nand linked to the \u2018discourse\u2019 school is ultimately pre-\nferential: human rights may be useful as a \u2018system of\npersuasion\u2019, but they are ultimately contested norms\nwith limited effect that are rooted in particular subjec-\ntive assumptions, and which do not rest on any firm\nnormative foundation (pp. 274\u201375).\nThe final book is less ambitious in its philosophi-\ncal ambitions than the first two, but no less interesting\nfor that. Greer in The European Convention on Human\nRights: Achievements, Problems and Prospects sets out to\nexamine the track record of the ECHR, its limits, suc-\ncesses and achievements, as well as the evolving role of\nthe Strasbourg court. He argues that the purpose of the\nConvention has changed: established at the beginning\nof the Cold War to serve as a statement of basic shared\nWestern European values in response to Communist\nauthoritarianism, it has morphed into an \u2018abstract con-\nstitutional model\u2019 for the European continent as a\nwhole, setting out a range of normative standards\nwhich public institutions across Europe must strive\nto meet.\nWhile more upbeat in his assessment of what the\nConvention has achieved than is Dembour, Greer shows\nthat the ECHR\u2019s enforcement machinery, and in particu-\nlar the Strasbourg court, has struggled to adjust to its\nchanged role. He examines how the shift to a constitu-\ntional role has impacted upon the jurisprudence and\ninterpretative approach of the Court, but also how the\ngrowing case-load has imposed intolerable burdens on\nthe functioning of the Court and has not been matched\nby adjustments to the Convention\u2019s barely adequate\nmachinery for ensuring state compliance. Greer concludes\nthis outstanding book by suggesting that this new \u2018con-\nstitutional\u2019 role for the Court is here to stay: therefore, he\nsuggests that considerable adjustments need to be made to\nthe admissibility rules, practice and procedure and func-\ntioning of the Court, as well as to the (currently very\nlimited) relationship between the Strasbourg institu-\ntions and national human rights bodies.\nGreer\u2019s concerns are therefore more specific and\nnarrower than those of Gearty and even Dembour,\nwho also concentrates upon the Strasbourg jurispru-\ndence but uses it for the purposes of her theoretical\narguments as a representative example of an institution\napplying human rights standards. However, all three\nbooks make substantial contributions to the existing\nliterature. All three are excellent pieces of human rights\nscholarship: each in their own way will constitute\nimportant points of reference for some time to come.\nThey also have the immense virtue of being well-\nwritten, clear and accessible: arguments are made with\npunch and style, with the Gearty and Dembour books\nbeing particularly readable and engaging.\nIndeed, from the perspective of a student, all three\nbooks strike the happy balance of combining rigorous\nargument with clear exposition. For academics, these\nbooks also have a welcome willingness to take contro-\nversial positions. Greer breaks ranks with much NGO\nopinion in questioning whether the right of individual\npetition to the Strasbourg court should remain open to\nall potential litigants. He suggests that this is now\nuntenable given the volume of the Court\u2019s case-load:\ninstead, the Court needs to be able to act as a constitu-\ntional court in selecting significant cases while reject-\ning others that are more appropriately dealt with\nelsewhere, a position which with I agree. Gearty reiter-\nates his oft-expressed scepticism about the legalisation\nof rights and is not afraid to highlight the very pro-\nblematic distinction between terrorism and political\nviolence. Dembour assaults sacred cows left, right\nand centre: her challenge to foundationalist accounts\nof rights, while not altogether new,4 is bracing, well-\nargued and refreshingly nuanced. She also brings\nanthropological and philosophical perspectives to bear\nin her analysis that are often overlooked in contempor-\nary human rights scholarship, including the always\ninteresting work of Guy Haarscher.5 Her book is\nalso notable for her use of personal experience and\nindividual examples to highlight the real people behind\nthe statistics of inadmissibility decisions and other\ncourt determinations.\nAs ever, there are parts of all three books that could\nhave been expanded, or better developed. I would have\nliked to see Gearty take forward the idea of human\nrights being founded on a Darwinian sense of compas-\nsion, and apply this to other contexts apart from\n4 See e.g. the discussion in Gaete (1993); see also Douzinas (2000); Baxi (2002).\n5 See e.g. Haarscher (1993); Haarscher and Fyrdman (2002).\nB OO K RE V I E W S 397\nhis usual safe terrain of the legalisation of rights and\nnational security. How, for example, could this idea\nbe applied in the context of socioeconomic rights?\nHowever, the format of the Hamlyn lectures perhaps\nprecluded this, and we may have to wait for subsequent\nworks. Dembour could perhaps have developed her\nconcept of \u2018rights nihilism\u2019 a little: does it differ very\nmuch from Rorty\u2019s pragmatic scepticism, despite its\nroots in Nietzsche\u2019s subjectivism? Much of Greer\u2019s\ntext has already seen the light of day in article form:\nthis means that some of the separate chapters are\nlargely self-contained and adhere to the framework of\ntheir progenitor articles. This means that in places\noverarching ideas are not as fully developed as perhaps\nideally they would be: for example, I would have liked\nto see more on the \u2018abstract constitutional role\u2019 the\nStrasbourg court is now playing. Greer argues that its\nfunctions increasingly mirror the constitutional review\nconducted by the US Supreme Court and German\nConstitutional Court. I tend to agree with him, but\ncan the often Delphic and case-specific findings of the\nCourt play a similar role as the more tangible norm-\nsetting role of national constitutional courts? Does\nStrasbourg ultimately have the authority and legiti-\nmacy to play such a role?\nHowever, pointing out how arguments could or\nshould have been developed further is the luxury of\nthe reviewer: all three books may not be perfectly com-\nplete, but all generate ideas, fresh insights and new\nperspectives of real value. What then can we take from\nthese useful pieces of human rights scholarship? Given\nthe simultaneous position of strength and weakness that\nhuman rights find themselves in at present, as outlined\nin the opening paragraphs of this review, do the argu-\nments made in these books stand up? Do they offer a\ncoherent account of where human rights ideas find\nthemselves now, and where they might find themselves\nin ten or twenty years\u2019 time?\nAt the time of the drafting of the Universal Decla-\nration in 1948 and the subsequent UN human rights\ntreaties of the 1960s and 1970s, human rights texts were\nthe product of a cross-cultural, cross-national dialogue:\nthey were intended to serve as a statement of agreed\nshared values that could unite a divided world in agree-\nment on certain basic minimal entitlements. For their\nframers, they perhaps were never meant to be anything\nelse. However, with the revigoration of natural law\nphilosophies in the wake of World War II, and the\nhugely influential work by Rawls, Dworkin and others\nwhich gave new and vibrant life to liberal political\nphilosophy, the human rights idea seemed to encap-\nsulate and give concrete shape to these exciting new\nnormative currents. Even philosophical perspectives\nrooted in more critical traditions, such as Habermasian\n\u2018discourse theory\u2019,6 Derridian deconstructionism and\nFoucaultian post-structuralism, have a tendency to\nreach for concepts rooted in the human rights tradition\nwhen it comes to outlining a positive agenda of pro-\ngressive change.7 Gearty exaggerates when he says that\nhuman rights have become a new \u2018secular religion\u2019:\nhowever, as I have suggested above, it has replaced\nsocialism and other ideologies as the progressive doc-\ntrine de jour. However, in an era apparently dominated\nby post-modern critique on the one hand, and a return\nto the easy certainties of total religious belief on the\nother, does the human rights idea rest on solid norma-\ntive foundations? Or is it essentially hollow in nature,\nand therefore vulnerable to its abuse, misappropriation\nand rejection?\nGearty and Dembour both share the belief that\n\u2018grand narrative\u2019 universalist theories of rights cannot\nstand up to post-modernist critique. Gearty, however,\nargues that his concept of \u2018Darwarian universalism\u2019,\nwhich is predicated upon the existence of a shared\nsense of compassion, can step into the normative gap:\nin the alternative, at least the lowest common deno-\nminator of this idea of human compassion can provide\na common point of agreement for all who wish to come\nunder the human rights umbrella. This is an attractive\nidea, and is well developed in Can Human Rights Survive?.\nHowever, can the vague and uncertain concept of com-\npassion really provide the idea of human rights with\nenough normative clarity?\nCompassion is a vague and imprecise emotion, and\nit will often be unclear what compassion for the under-\ndog actually requires. Conflicting stances on many\nissues can readily be justified by citing compassionate\nimpulses. The invasion of Iraq, the detention without\ntrail of alleged terrorists, access to abortion or the rights\nof defendants within a criminal justice system are all\nexamples: in each case, \u2018compassion\u2019 can be used as a\njustification for almost any stance that one wants to\nadopt. However, it cannot by itself give human rights\nthe hard and clear definition that is required, if the idea\nof rights is to give firm normative guidance on difficult\nand controversial questions. More is needed.\n6 The roots of much of Habermas\u2019s theoretical framework lies in the critical thought of the Frankfurt School;\nsee McCarthy (1979).\n7 See for example the indirect affirmation of certain human rights concepts in Derrida (2001). See also the\ninteresting discussion in Lindgren (2000).\nB OO K R E V I E WS398\nI would suggest that when human rights argu-\nments are deployed to push for governments to adopt\nor to avoid a particular course of action, much of their\nnormative and emotional appeal lies in their claim to\ncombine both compassion and rationality in a coherent\npackage. If one for example argues for greater respect for\nthe human rights of asylum seekers, one is arguing (a)\nfor more compassionate treatment, but also (b) for treat-\nment that is founded on a more coherent set of moral\nprinciples than that currently being inflicted. Human\nrights claims are more than emotional appeals to the\ngood nature or conscience of government: they contain\na morally rationalist component, as well as an emotive\ndimension.\nThis claim to contain a rational dimension, embo-\ndied in legal requirements such as the proportionality\ntest, gives added force to rights arguments. This rational\ncomponent is also relied upon to define what course of\naction best complies with rights standards, and to give\nprecision to human rights claims that mere appeals to\ncompassion lack. However, this appeal to rational prin-\nciples means that rights claims invariably place some\nreliance upon the very Enlightenment-rooted philoso-\nphical constructs that Gearty suggests lack authority in\nthe post-modern era. As a result, I am sceptical whether\nthe human rights edifice can be built up from Gearty\u2019s\ncompassion principle alone.\nIndeed, Dembour is sceptical about the existence of\nany objective normative foundation for rights ideology,\nhence her \u2018rights nihilism\u2019. Indeed, she is sceptical about\nthe idea of human rights in general, seeing its primary\nvalue as a useful rhetorical tool to be deployed where\nappropriate for progressive ends. She bases her scep-\nticism on her extensive critique of the case-law of the\nStrasbourg court. Dembour makes a questionable logi-\ncal jump here, moving from identifying the limits and\ngaps of the Strasbourg jurisprudence to a wider philo-\nsophical critique of the human rights idea in general.\nThe deficiencies of the Strasbourg jurisprudence may\ngive rise to questions about the usefulness of institutio-\nnalising rights via a legal framework. However, it does\nnot necessary indict the human rights idea itself, which\nis of course separable and often much more capable\nof having an emancipatory impact outside of legal\nframeworks.8 In other words, Dembour relies too\nmuch on a critique of a specific legal framework in\nmaking a wider case about human rights thinking in\ngeneral. Nevertheless, her critique of human rights ideol-\nogy has considerable force, especially since the aim of\nmuch of the human rights movement is to embed rights\nin legal structures such as the ECHR. However, if Dem-\nbour is correct in arguing that the human rights idea is\ndevoid of real objective normative force, then can it be\nsustained in the face of competing ideologies?\nDembour focuses on predominantly \u2018progressive\u2019\ncritiques of rights, but notably absent from her analysis\nare the challenges that are made against human rights\nby conservative, fundamentalist or authoritarian critics\nof rights. These perspectives are notable for their absence\nfrom most academic analysis, but in practice are often\npolitically very potent. At the heart of these critiques\nusually lies an assertion of subjective values at the\nexpense of what is usually presented as a false or hollow\ncosmopolitan universalism: the needs of a particular\nnational group, or a particular belief, or a particular\n\u2018way of life\u2019 are presented as more deserving of protec-\ntion than universal rights norms. The post-modern cri-\ntical embrace of subjectivity finds an uncomfortable\necho in these conservative assaults upon rights values.9\nIf Dembour\u2019s \u2018human rights nihilism\u2019 is the position\nto which the \u2018crisis of authority\u2019 has lead us, there may\nbe a price to be paid if the human rights project can no\nlonger be credibly seen as articulating objective norms of\nuniversal validity. Why should the \u2018discourse\u2019 of human\nrights command any more respect than the particularist\ndiscourses of nationality, religion, culture, values and\neven race? If the idea of human rights becomes just one\nmore ideology, then it may lose its \u2018aura\u2019 of normative\nsuperiority. This is perhaps why Gearty wishes to find\nsome basis for the human rights ideal in the idea of\nhuman compassion. Dembour is less concerned about\nthis prospect, welcoming greater normative scepticism\nabout rights. However, it remains to be seen whether\nthe appeal of human rights ideology can survive the\npotential loss of its \u2018aura\u2019.\nThis potential loss of \u2018aura\u2019 could also afflict the\ndelicate and somewhat precarious structure of inter-\nnational human rights institutions. Even well-established\n8 See Meckled-Garcia and Cali (2005). Dembour contributes an interesting chapter to this excellent collection.\n9 Conservative commentators have been very slow to use the rhetoric and conceptual armoury of post-\nmodernism to challenge human rights ideology, mainly because \u2018mainstream\u2019 conservative thinkers tend\nto reject many of the tenets of post-modernism, in particular in the Anglo-American sphere. However, over\nthe last decade, nationalist and hard-right commentators now increasingly use the language of value\nscepticism and some of the tropes of post-modernist thought to critique what they see as false cosmopolitan\nuniversalism. See Antonio (2000); see also the discussion of the writings of Alain De Benoist in Griffin (2000).\nFor an analysis of the relationship between post-modernism and Islamist fundamentalist thought, see\nSardar (1997).\nB OO K RE V I E W S 399\nhuman rights institutions such as the ECHR and its\nenforcement machinery remain vulnerable to political\nwinds. If the human rights ideal were to become\ntarnished, or become one more ideology amongst many,\nthe status and prestige of the Strasbourg mechanisms\nwill increasingly be exposed to new challenges. This is\nalready happening: the European Court of Human Rights\nis coming under new forms of political pressure, especially\nfrom Western European governments concerned about\nthe terrorist threat10 and from Russia\u2019s increasingly overt\nhostility to the Strasbourg institutions. In addition, the\nStrasbourg court is to an extent a victim of its own success:\nas Greer discusses, with its huge case-load, the Court is\nbuckling under the strain of living up to the expectations\nthat it has successfully generated over the last two decades.\nTaken together, these factors combine to create an increas-\ningly turbulent climate for the Court, notwithstanding its\nstatus as one of the more respected and effective human\nrights institutions in the world.\nThis should be a source of concern to those well\ndisposed towards the human rights ideal, even if only in\na qualified and provisional way. Dembour\u2019s critique of\nthe Court makes too much of the inevitable compro-\nmises, caution and judicial tentativeness that come with\nthe legalisation of rights via a judicial (or any other)\nframework. She herself notes that the European Court\nof Human Rights has been a valuable agent for progres-\nsive change. Human rights institutions will inevitably\ndisappoint, to some extent. However, they are essential\nfor infusing human rights concepts into the blood-\nstream of mainstream legal and political discourse.\nGreer\u2019s book is invaluable in discussing the ways in\nwhich the Strasbourg court has achieved some success\nin achieving this gradual transfusion over the last few\ndecades, and in exploring how this relative success can\nbe maintained and followed though. However, it may be\nthat the future of the Court may depend as much on the\nideology of human rights maintaining its current \u2018aura\u2019\nas on the institutional dynamics that Greer discusses. In\nother words, the current difficulties that the Court finds\nitself in are linked to the wider issues affecting human\nrights, a dimension that perhaps Greer underplays in his\notherwise excellent analysis.\nThe idea of human rights has reached its current\nsalience in an era of accelerating neoliberalism, post-\nmodern erosion of attempts to construct universalist\nnormative projects, and the apparent resurgence of par-\nticularist alternative ideologies. Some of the current\nappeal of human rights ideology may stem from how\nrights thinking is both linked to these trends and yet also\nis opposed to them in interesting and complex ways. The\nhuman rights idea can accommodate a wide diversity of\ndifferent philosophical viewpoints, as Dembour shows.\nIt gives expression to common human needs and bonds,\nas Gearty argues. The institutions established to protect\nrights may have the capacity to adopt and change over\ntime, as Greer illustrates. However, in the final analysis,\nhuman rights may be inextricably intertwined with the\nEnlightenment project, which may prove to be an inher-\nent strength or considerable weakness in the years\nahead.11\nReferences\nANTONIO, R.
