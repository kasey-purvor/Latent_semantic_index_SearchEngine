They will be startled to realise that the term is of course\nequally applicable to quite different equations describing Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac\nassemblies, white dwarf and neutron stars, supernov\u00e6, plasma and nuclear matter. In\nfact, the equation of state (EOS) describes any physical system by the relation between\nits thermodynamic properties e.g. pressure, volume and temperature. The EOS thus\nprovides a universal way of considering Nature under all possible conditions, just provided\nthat local thermodynamic equilibrium can be maintained. The concept is applicable even\nunder very extreme conditions, leading to interdisciplinary studies and applications in e.g.\nhigh pressure physics, geophysics, astrophysics, and plasma physics.\nStudies of the EOS should therefore be seen as of fundamental importance in physics,\nwhich is what provides the justification for reprinting Eliezer et al\u2019s interesting book. It\nis an ambitious work, seeking to cover the subject in 366 pages. After an introductory\nchapter to set the scene, the authors summarise classical thermodynamics and statisti-\ncal mechanics in just 8 pages, providing the essential basis for much that follows. The\nnext 14 chapters treat matter in all its variety, including ideal gases, vibration and ro-\ntation in molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, the Fermi-Dirac EOS (both non-\nrelativistic and relativistic), ionization and the Saha equation, the Debye Hu\u00a8ckel equation,\nthe Thomas-Fermi and related models, the Gru\u00a8neissen EOS, fluid mechanics, shock waves,\nthe EOS for thermonuclear fusion under inertial confinement, the EOS in astrophysics (ex-\ntensively, in 44 pages), and the EOS in elementary particle physics. There is a thoughtful\nForword by Edward Teller, and 8 appendices treating topics such as the density of states\nfor a particle in a box, and the derivation of Stirling\u2019s formula. A list of references is\nprovided at the end, grouped by chapter.\nThe book was originally published by Cambridge University Press in 1986 with a\nslightly different title. The present version published by World Scientific seems to be a\nstraight reprint, with the text unchanged apart from a new Preface. In the latter, the\nauthors refer to some of the many new results reported since 1986, and argue that\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 44, 275 (2003).\n\u201c...the unchanged text of the original publication... may be of even greater\nrelevance now for advanced lecturing and for important new research and\napplications.\u201d\nIt takes either courage, or laziness, to reprint a book after a gap of 16 years, without\nupdating anything. In the present case, I feel that it is the former quality that applies,\nas this is one of those books that seems almost timeless in its relevance and applicability.\nQuite possibly, it can be reprinted again in 2018 without change, or with only very minor\nones e.g. extensions of the applications and to the corresponding references.\nThe readers of the book should include all physicists who take a broad view of their\nsubject and do not confine themselves just to narrow specialisms. The EOS is one of\nthose unifying concepts that is applicable across almost all of physics, and beyond it to\nchemistry, materials science and engineering. The book is probably not recommended\nreading for many particular lecture courses but, because it provides a cross-cut through\nthe traditional packaging of the subject, it has someting useful for almost all courses and\nlevels of presentation beyond 2nd year undergraduate, not least because it provides such\na nice demonstration of the essential unity of physics.\nPeter V.E.
