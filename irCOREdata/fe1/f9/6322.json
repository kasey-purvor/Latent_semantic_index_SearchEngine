As part of this initiative, a separate publication\ncontaining the full research papers was produced alongside the book of abstracts. This was\nproduced by John Cook (London Metropolitan University, UK) and David McConnell\n(Sheffield University, UK) and is available to order from the ALT website.\nIn previous years, authors have been invited to submit papers from the conference to a\nspecial issue of ALT-J. This year, we were unsure whether authors would feel the need to\nsubmit updated papers to ALT-J when a full version had already been published. In the\nend, the number of conference papers submitted was lower than in previous years-r as a\nresult this issue contains a mixture of these and other articles. We suspect that this will be\nthe pattern for future years, too, and so have decided to suspend the annual conference\nissue of the journal. This means that ALT-J will now involve two regular issues and one\nthemed issue per year, giving authors greater flexibility and making the editorial workload\nsmoother. Authors of papers at ALT-C (from any strand) are still encouraged to submit\ntheir work to the journal, where their papers will be considered alongside our regular\nsubmissions.\nOur last themed issue was the memorial edition for David Squires. This issue opens with\nanother paper that we could not include in 10 (3) for reasons of space. Tosunoglu Blake et\nal. consider different approaches to evaluating learning technology. David Squires\nencouraged educational evaluators and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) specialists to\nlearn from each other in order to advance their joint concern of improving education;\nreassuringly, they find some evidence to suggest that there is convergence between these\napproaches.\nOur other articles address a number of important topics. Goodyear et al. examine the\nrelationship between conceptions of learning, approaches to study and participation in\n2\nALT-] Volume 11 Number I\nfour networked learning courses; the lack of evidence they find for a relationship between\nthese implies that all learners have the potential to benefit from such courses. Rowley\nconsiders ways of studying students' use of electronic information services, something\nwhich has formed a major focus for development work within the UK. This work\nrepresents an important step towards developing systematic conclusions about patterns of\nuse and impact, rather than relying solely on informative but isolated case studies. Davies\npresents a study of computer-aided peer assessment that proves it is both possible and\nbeneficial to support anonymized discussion of feedback.\nThe article selected as a discussion piece for this issue has been provided by Lisewski and\nJoyce. This piece concerns the way in which learning technology practitioners are using\nmodels (such as Gilly Salmon's five-stage e-moderating model), and argues that we need to\nbe more cautious and thoughtful in how we use these if they are to enhance our academic\nlegitimacy rather than leaving us beholden to managerial, commodifying influences on\nhigher education. This is a thought-provoking and timely article, particularly given ALT'S\naspiration to act as a professional body - it raises important questions about what it means\nfor us to have 'professional' expertise and highlights the difficult tension between drawing\non simple but uncritical 'solutions' and losing sight of practice in thoughtful but abstract\nconceptions. A response to this article is currently being written; this, together with the\nrejoinder from Lisewski and Joyce, will appear in issue 11 (2).\nMartin Oliver\nDeputy Editor\n3\n"}
