INTRODUCTION\nSoluble tablets are used as delivery agents across a wide\nspectrum of technology sectors, from agriculture to medi-\ncine. They are made by compressing powders, and they in-\nevitably contain some air voids between the particles. An\nobvious question to ask is, what happens to these air voids as\nthe tablet dissolves? We address this question quantitatively\nfor a model tablet system comprising a compressed mixture\nof insoluble polymer and soluble drug particles. We do so by\nusing x-ray computed microtomography \u0001CT\u0002 and magnetic\nresonance microimaging \u0001MRI\u0002, combined with a simple the-\noretical analysis. The x-ray CT method in particular allows\nus to noninvasively obtain the probability distribution func-\ntion of the void size in a single tablet at a number of different\ntimes throughout the dissolution process. We find that the\nvoids coarsen, i.e., grow, as the time since the tablet was\nimmersed in water increases. Our analysis is similar to that\ndeveloped for other systems that undergo coarsening, such as\nthe domains in a phase-separating mixture \u00031,2\u0004 and in the\ndroplets of a coarsening emulsion \u00033,4\u0004.\nMotivation for studying the dissolution of a soluble com-\nponent mixed as particles with an insoluble component is\nprovided by tablet use in the controlled release of drugs, in\nagricultural products such as pesticides, and in a range of\ncleaning products such as detergents. Although simple mod-\nels of these materials have been studied \u00035\u0004, the successful\ndesign of polymer matrix controlled release tablets remains\nsomething of a black art, constrained by a restricted under-\nstanding of the mechanisms of dissolution. With better ex-\nperimental data and hence understanding would come the\nability to model the behavior of current delivery systems and\nconfidently predict the behavior of future systems.\nTablets made of compressed powders contain structure\nover length scales from angstroms, the interfaces between\nparticles and the surrounding air or water, to many microme-\nters, the air voids and large particles, to millimeters, the size\nof individual tablets. This makes their behavior potentially\ncomplex and therefore hard to understand and hard to pre-\ndict. For example, the rate of dissolution of the soluble com-\nponent potentially depends on the dissolution rate at the in-\nterface between water and its crystalline particles; on its\noverall solubility and concentration-dependent diffusion con-\nstant; on any potential swelling of the insoluble matrix; as\nwell as on structure on larger length scales, for example the\nporosity, which may well evolve with time. Thus a compre-\nhensive study will require applying a range of techniques to\nprobe a number of phenomena over a range of length scales.\nHere we use x-ray computed microtomography \u00036\u0004 and mag-\nnetic resonance microimaging \u00037\u0004 to probe the larger length\nscales. Spectroscopic techniques can also be used, e.g., Fou-\nrier transform infrared \u0001FTIR\u0002 \u00038\u0004 and Raman spectroscopy\n\u00039\u0004.\nThe fact that the systems are wet, soft, and evolving with\ntime hampers direct measurement. X-ray CT and MRI have\nthe ability to provide internal images of soft materials under\nstudy and to visualize the sample in three dimensions. Both\nx-ray CT and MRI are nondestructive and noninvasive. MRI\nis firmly established as a valuable tool for analyzing liquid\ntransport in polymers and polymer dissolution. It can be used\nto follow water ingress into polymer matrices \u000310,11\u0004 the\npolymer swelling and dissolution \u000312\u0004, and the release of\nsome soluble components \u000313,14\u0004. Image contrast is strongly\nweighted by molecular motion, providing a means to visual-\nizing different components. Maps of the water distribution\nand, in appropriate cases, the dissolved component also, can\nbe obtained and used to test theoretical models. X-ray CT is\nan imaging technique that can also provide cross-sectional\nimages in different planes through a sample and has recently\nbeen advanced in the area of drug development. Sinka et al.\n\u00036\u0004 measured the material density distribution in pharmaceu-\ntical tablets noninvasively by x-ray CT. Rather than mobility,\nimage contrast is dominated by electron density. CT is there-\nfore complementary to MRI.\nIn the next section we briefly describe our material: an\ninsoluble, and also nonswelling, polymer matrix containing a\n*Corresponding author.

Section III describes\nour techniques and Sec. IV presents our results, while Sec. V\nanalyzes these in the light of competing models for coarsen-\ning. It is shown that the growth of these air voids is consis-\ntent with a stochastic model of ripening involving discrete\ncoalescence events. The final section is a conclusion.\nII. MATERIALS\nThe polymer used in this study is Eudragit RSPO \u0001De-\ngussa Pharma Polymers, Darmstadt, Germany\u0002. It is com-\nmonly used in film coating of tablets, granules, and other\nsmall particles and also in matrix formulation. It is a copoly-\nmer of acrylic and methacrylic acid ester with low content of\nquaternary ammonium groups. The ammonium groups are\npresent as salts and make the polymer permeable. Eudragit is\ngenerally considered to be nonswelling in water \u000315\u0004 al-\nthough there is some evidence that it does swell slightly in\ndigestive tract fluids \u000316,17\u0004. We find that a tablet made from\nonly Eudragit swells by \u00054% and we do not observe the air\nvoids found in the mixed Eudragit-soluble component tab-\nlets. The polymer particle size was graded 45\u2013100 \u0002m. The\nsoluble drug is diltiazem hydrochloride \u0001Spectrum Chemical\nand Laboratory Products, Gardena, California, USA\u0002, a cal-\ncium ion cellular influx inhibitor. Diltiazem hydrochloride is\na solid crystalline powder, highly soluble in water. The drug\nparticle size distribution was also graded 45\u2013100 \u0002m.\nIII. METHODS\nA. 1H imaging\nImaging experiments were carried out using a 1H\n400 MHz Chemagnetics Infinity Spectrometer \u0001Varian Lim-\nited, Oxford, UK\u0002 coupled to a Magnex 9.4 T \u000189 mm wide-\nbore\u0002 superconducting magnet \u0001Magnex Scientific, Oxon,\nUK\u0002. The spectrometer was equipped with a 1H microscopy\nprobe \u0001IBMT, Fraunhofer-Institute f\u00fcr Biomedizinische\nTechnik IBMT, St. Ingebert, Germany\u0002 and imaging gradi-\nents \u0001Resonance Research Instruments, Austin, Texas, USA\u0002.\nFor the MRI measurements reported here, tablets com-\nposed of a mixture of polymer and drug were prepared on a\npure polymer tablet base. This provided greater structural\nintegrity during the dissolution of tablets with a high drug\nfraction. To make such samples, a base layer of Eudragit\npowder was first lightly pressed in an instrumented single-\npunch tablet pressing machine \u0001IP Technical Services, Rich-\nmond, UK\u0002 equipped with 9 mm flat-faced punches. A mix-\nture of Eudragit and drug in the volume ratio 45% polymer\nto 55% drug was then added above this layer and the whole\nsample fully compressed at a pressure of 0.30 GPa. The\nmanufactured sample matrix was therefore 9 mm in diam-\neter. The height of the sample was 3.0\u00b10.2 mm. The samples\nwere placed in 9 mm internal diameter NMR tubes, sup-\nported from below on a thin polytetrafluoroethylene \u0001PTFE\u0002\ncollar. The collar enabled both sides of the tablet to be ex-\nposed to a volume of water large compared to the sample\nvolume. However, water substantially ingressed the mixed\nlayer only from above. The water was lightly doped \u00013.7\n\u000310\u22124M\u0002 with copper sulfate \u0001CuSO4, Fisher Scientific UK\nLtd, Loughborough, UK\u0002 in order to reduce the 1H nuclear\nspin-lattice relaxation time. Measurements were also per-\nformed using a phosphate buffer solution \u0001without CuSO4\u0002 to\nmodify the pH. Although these measurements took longer to\nrecord for equivalent signal-to-noise ratio, due to the in-\ncreased spin-lattice relaxation time, the results were not sub-\nstantially different from those reported here. The MR images\nwere obtained using a standard spin-echo imaging sequence\n\u000318\u0004 with an echo time of 4 ms. Coronal slices at the center\nof the tablet \u0001that is, slices containing the longitudinal sym-\nmetry axis of the sample and one diameter\u0002 with thickness of\n1 mm were imaged. The image field of view was 15\n\u000324 mm2 with an in-plane pixel resolution of 29\n\u0003188 \u0002m2 \u0001the better resolution being in the longitudinal\ndirection\u0002. The acquisition time of each image was 34 min.\nB. X-ray computed microtomography\nThe microstructure of the sample matrix was observed\nusing a bench-top third-generation cone-beam x-ray com-\nputed microtomography \u0001\u0002CT\u0002 scanner \u000319\u0004. The x-ray de-\ntector used was a Hamamatsu C7942 flat-panel complemen-\ntary metal oxide semiconductor array and the x-ray source\nused was a Hamamatsu L6731-01 microfocus x-ray tube\nwith a focal spot size of 5 \u0002m operated at a peak energy of\n55 kV and a filament current of 0.1 mA. The distance be-\ntween the source and the sample was 50 mm whereas the\ndistance between the sample and the x-ray detector was\n450 mm.\nThe measurements were conducted on samples manufac-\ntured in an identical way to those used for MRI except that\nthe polymer and drug fractions were 75% and 25%, respec-\ntively; the sample diameter and height were both 3 mm; and\nthe compression pressure was 0.14 GPa. The smaller drug\nfraction was used for two reasons. First it slowed the disso-\nlution to a rate comparable to that of image data acquisition.\nSecond, it improved the structural integrity of the tablets\nduring dissolution. The samples were exposed to distilled\nwater. 450 x-ray radiograph projections were acquired while\nrotating the sample through 360 deg. The detector digitized\nthe projection data into 512\u0003512 pixels with a pixel depth\nof 14 bits. The total scan time was 40 min, comparable to\nthat for MRI. The x-ray projections contain superimposed\nimages of the sample which were recovered into a three-\ndimensional data set using a Feldkamp cone-beam back pro-\njection routine \u000320\u0004. The magnification of the source-sample\nand sample-detector distances resulted in a voxel dimension\nof 10\u000310\u000310 \u0002m3 over a field of view of 5.12 mm in each\ndirection.\nIV. RESULTS\nA. 1H MRI imaging\nFigure 1 shows a time series of 1H MRI two-dimensional\nimages of the polymer-drug matrix sample exposed to water.\nThe images each took 34 min to acquire. The contrast results\nalmost exclusively from differences in molecular mobility of\nwater, polymer, and drug. The lighter upper and lower re-\ngions of the images are the water. The apparently fading top\nKARAKOSTA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 74, 011504 \u00012006\u0002\n011504-2\nand bottom shows where the tube extends beyond the sensi-\ntive region of the scanner defined by the sensor coil. The\ndark horizontal strip in the middle is the polymer base to the\ntablet, which is scarcely affected by the water. However,\ncareful numerical analysis of the image intensity suggests it\nrapidly takes up circa 4% water. Above this is the tablet. In\nthe first image, it is largely uninvaded by water. Again, how-\never, detailed analysis of the signal intensity in this \u0001and\nother images recorded more quickly at lower resolution\u0002\ncoupled with gravimetric analysis suggests that water rapidly\nabsorbs into the open porosity of the tablet. When drug is\npresent, this corresponds to circa 2% of the total volume, less\nthan with pure polymer. In the subsequent time series, a\nsharp, clear water diffusion front is seen to invade the tablet.\nIt is noted that the front advances as the square root of time.\nMore importantly, as far as this work is concerned, a series\nof air voids, visualized as dark spots, are seen to form and\ngrow. Curiously, these air voids develop both behind and in\nfront of the primary diffusion front. Corroborative evidence\nthat these dark spots are indeed air voids comes from the fact\nthat they display the classic artifact of a bright streak in the\ndirection of the so-called MRI \u201cread\u201d or \u201cfrequency encode\u201d\ngradient. The streaks are caused by the significant difference\nin magnetic susceptibility between the void space \u0001air\u0002 and\nthe matrix \u0001polymer-drug-water\u0002 \u000321\u0004.\nB. X-ray \u0001CT\nThe MRI results show interesting changes in the micro-\nstructure of the sample. X-ray \u0002CT was employed to probe it\non a finer length scale. The reconstructed x-ray CT data are\nessentially a set of consistent but uncalibrated gray-scale val-\nues. By separately scanning samples of pressed polymer,\npressed drug, water, and air under the same acquisition pa-\nrameters the gray-scale values can be assigned to either poly-\nmer, drug, air or water \u0001see Fig. 2\u0002. In a dry system, polymer\nand drug can be easily distinguished. In a wet system, the\nwater dramatically complicates the analysis as it has a very\nsimilar electron density and composition to the polymer. The\ngray-scale values overlap. Moreover, in mixed systems, par-\ntial filling of voxels by more than one component leads to\nintermediate gray-scale values. From the image analysis\nviewpoint, this is a serious complication which hinders quan-\ntitative analysis. Notwithstanding this, air-filled voxels are\neasily distinguished from the matrix.\nFigure 3 shows the central coronal slices extracted from a\nthree-dimensional data set of a tablet exposed to water. In\nFig. 3\u0001a\u0002, which is an image of the dry system, the tablet is\nclearly seen as the dappled region. The dark space above and\nto the sides is air space into which the water is subsequently\nplaced \u0003Figs. 3\u0001b\u0002\u20133\u0001h\u0002\u0004.

Figures 3\u0001b\u0002\u20133\u0001h\u0002 show a time series of images of\nwater ingressing into the tablet. As with the MRI results, it is\nseen that after adding water, the tablet quickly divides into\ntwo parts: that in which water has clearly invaded and the\ndrug component has been dissolved \u0001an outer region\u0002 and\nthat where it has invaded to a much less extent \u0001the inner\nregion\u0002. Ingress into the inner region results from capillary\nuptake into the open porosity of the tablet. The two regions\nare again separated by a sharp front. The former grows at the\nexpense of the latter. Again air voids are seen to form and\ngrow with time. As with MRI, the voids are seen in both the\ninner and outer regions of the tablet.\nThe air-void size distribution p\u0001V\u0002 was extracted from the\nthree-dimensional x-ray \u0002CT data. This was done using the\ngray-scale values, shown in Fig. 2, to apply a binary thresh-\nold to reveal just the air voids. Face connected pixels were\ndiscretely assigned to be part of a single void and so an\nair-void volume size distribution was determined. The void\nsize distribution is obtained for the whole tablet, notwith-\nstanding the fact that the ingressing solvent divides the tablet\ninto two regions as discussed above. A typical distribution is\nshown in Fig. 4, this example extracted from the data set at\n270 min. It is found that the void size distribution is well\ncharacterized by a log-normal size distribution\np\u0001V\u0002 =\n1\n\u00012\u0004\u00021\/2\u0005V\nexp\u0006\u2212 12\u0007 ln\u0001V\u0002 \u2212 ln\u0001V\u0002\u0005 \b2\t \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0005 is the standard deviation of ln\u0001V\u0002 centered on the\nmean value ln\u0001V\u0002. The solid black curve of Fig. 4 is a fit of\nthis function to the data.\nThe true mean air-void volume V\u00af is simply related to\nln\u0001V\u0002 by\nV\u00af = exp\u00072ln\u0001V\u0002 + \u000522 \b \u00012\u0002\nand is plotted as a function of time in Fig. 5. It is seen to\nincrease linearly with time. In order to assess the mechanism\nfor this growth, the four largest air voids, by volume, were\ndigitally extracted from the central 500\u0003500\u0003500 \u0002m3 re-\ngion of the tablet. Figure 6 shows a three-dimensional vol-\nume rendering of the four largest air voids at 180, 225, 270,\nand 315 min. The total accumulated volume of these four air\nvoids is 1.16\u0003106, 1.51\u0003106, 1.32\u0003106, and 1.10\n\u0003106 \u0002m3, respectively. Figure 6\u0001e\u0002 shows the movement of\nthe centers of mass of the four voids. The individual void\nsizes and movement are presented in Tables I and II, respec-\ntively, together with measurement errors.\nThe data of Fig. 6 and Tables I and II are noisy but it is\nnotable that over the time period there is no trend in the\nvolume of three of the voids, 1, 2, and 3, whereas for the\nvoid number 4, there is no detectable trend over the first\nthree times but between the third and fourth times, its vol-\nume decreases dramatically. This volume may be redistribut-\ning into the nearby void number 3 but our data are too noisy\nto prove or disprove this. Note that although void 4 is close\nto other voids it does not appear to be in contact with them.\nThus coalescence may not involve voids diffusing into con-\ntact, as emulsion droplets do, but instead only approaching\nclosely enough that the air can cross a narrow region of\nporous matrix between them. However, the actual mecha-\nnism of air transport is on length scales smaller than those\nwe can observe with the two techniques employed here.\nThe four chosen voids are not typical: they are among the\nlargest in the sample. They are chosen as their large size\nFIG. 4.

Attempts to repeat the exercise\nwith smaller voids encounters two problems: first the mea-\nsurement errors become larger since the void surface-to-\nvolume ratio is increased; second, the voids are more numer-\nous and move more quickly so that it is harder to\nunambiguously track the motion of specific voids given the\nframe rate of the available data.\nV. ANALYSIS AND THEORETICAL MODEL\nThe experimental results show three main features: \u00011\u0002 the\nprobability distribution function of air voids is well fitted by\na log-normal distribution function, \u00012\u0002 the mean volume in-\ncreases linearly with time, and \u00013\u0002 there is evidence the vol-\nume of a void can suddenly collapse, presumably as its vol-\nume is distributed to adjacent voids.\nWe assume that the ultimate state of our system would be\na single air void, which might escape, plus a solid matrix\nwithout voids. The process by which initially small domains,\nhere our air voids, start off small, but coarsen over time to\nbecome larger and larger has been widely studied. It occurs\nin systems undergoing phase separation, and the droplets in\nan emulsion also tend to coarsen. Thus, attempts to under-\nstand the coarsening of droplets, particles, or voids have a\nlong history. Two main mechanisms have been studied ex-\ntensively: coarsening via diffusion from small to large drop-\nlets driven by chemical potential gradients, called Ostwald\nripening, and coarsening by the diffusion of droplets into\ncontact followed by their coalescence.\nThe theory for coarsening via diffusion of molecules\ndown chemical potential gradients is well developed. It was\ninitially introduced by Lifshitz and Slyozov \u000322\u0004 and Wagner\n\u000323\u0004 \u0001LSW\u0002 and much work has been done since \u000324,25\u0004.\nHere, the smaller droplets have large surface-to-volume ra-\ntios and so the surface tension contributes a larger amount to\nthe chemical potential in these smaller droplets than in the\nlarger droplets. So there is a chemical potential gradient from\nsmall to large droplets down which molecules diffuse, thus\ncausing the large droplets to grow at the expense of the\nsmaller droplets. Dickinson et al. \u000326\u0004 studied the Ostwald\nripening kinetics in n-alkane oil-in-water emulsions stabi-\nlized by sodium caseinate to monitor the time-dependent\nchanges in the average droplet diameter and droplet size dis-\ntribution. They found a linear increase of droplet size with\ntime stored. In Ostwald ripening, the growth \u0001shrinkage\u0002 of\nthe large \u0001small\u0002 droplets is continuous and, as LSW showed,\nthe distribution of droplet sizes at late times is rather narrow\nwith a rather sharp cutoff at large sizes. Our distribution of\nvoid volumes is well fitted by a log-normal distribution\nwhich is rather different from the LSW distribution; in par-\nticular, there is no cutoff at large sizes. However, LSW do\npredict a linear growth of the mean void volume with time,\nwhich is what we observe \u0001see Fig. 5\u0002. Finally, LSW predict\nthat the four large droplets shown in Fig. 6 should grow\nsmoothly at the expense of the smaller droplets that are not\nshown, but one of the large droplets actually shrinks dramati-\ncally during one time interval. Thus we conclude that the\nLSW model although it correctly predicts \u00012\u0002, disagrees with\nour observations \u00011\u0002 and \u00013\u0002.\nThe second mechanism that causes the increase in length\nscale is particles or voids diffusing into contact and then\ncoalescing. This is believed to occur in some emulsions. The\ndroplet size distribution in emulsions has been studied and it\nis well described by a log-normal size distribution \u000327,28\u0004.\nOur experimental data do not have the resolution to deter-\nmine whether or not voids actually diffuse into contact; how-\never, any mechanism whereby the voids spend long periods\nof time with approximately constant volumes, punctuated by\nevents in which two adjacent voids combine relatively rap-\nidly to form a single void, tends to yield a log-normal-like\ndistribution. Briefly, the demonstration of this is as follows\n\u0001see also Granqvist and Buhrman \u000329\u0004\u0002.\nLet us start at t=0, with a void of volume V0. We assume\nthat it combines in some unspecified way with another void\nof comparable volume. Thus after one combination event the\nvoid has a volume 2V0. If this void also combines with a\nvoid that at this later time is again comparable in volume to\nitself then it has a volume 4V0. Therefore, after k combina-\ntion events the volume V0 is given by\nVk = 2kV0 or ln\nVk\nV0\n= k\u0001ln 2\u0002 . \u00013\u0002\nThe collisions are random events. At time t, the number of\nevents is described by a Gaussian distribution pt\u0001k\u0002 \u000330\u0004.\nThus, since the probability distribution function for ln Vk is\nGaussian the probability distribution function for Vk itself is\nlog-normal. Now, we assumed, incorrectly of course, that at\nTABLE I. Physical measurements for the four largest air voids\nin the central 500\u0003500\u0003500 \u0002m3 region of the tablet.

More sophisti-\ncated treatments that calculate the time evolution of pt\u0001k\u0002\nusing Smoluchowski-type equations have been performed by\nVillarica et al. \u000331\u0004. These calculations predicted a size dis-\ntribution of the form V\u0006 exp\u0001\u2212V \/\u0007\u0002, i.e., a power law times\nan exponential decay. A distribution of this form is often\ncalled a Schulz distribution. It is different from a log-normal\ndistribution but for \u0006\b0 it can look rather similar to a log-\nnormal distribution \u000331\u0004. We have fitted a Schulz distribution\nto our data in Fig. 4. The fit is of comparable quality to that\nobtained with a log-normal function. Our data are not suffi-\ncient to tell whether the distribution function of the void size\nis log-normal or Schulz. Note that the distribution of void\nsizes is quite sharply peaked; the ratio between the standard\ndeviation and the mean of the log-normal fit is 0.3 and this\nresults in the fit parameter \u0006=7.5.\nOur second observation was that the mean volume of a\nvoid scaled linearly with time. This is entirely consistent\nwith a reasonable model for the rate at which voids coalesce.\nPerhaps the easiest way to see this is as follows. If the rate at\nwhich voids coalesce, and hence the rate of decrease of the\nnumber of voids, n, is proportional to the square of the num-\nber density of voids we have that dn \/dt\tn2, for t the time.\nThis assumption that the rate is proportional to the square of\nthe number density of voids is perhaps the most obvious\nassumption if the process that reduces the number of voids is\na two-void process. The solution to this equation is n\t t\u22121. If\nthe number of voids is varying as t\u22121 then as the total void\nvolume is conserved the mean void volume will increase as\nt\u2014the observed behavior. However, within the Smolu-\nchowski theory \u000331\u0004 there is a relation between the depen-\ndence of the rate of collision of voids and their size and the\nrate of increase of the mean void size. In particular, our\nnarrow distributions with \u0006=7.5 only result if the rate of\ncollision of a pair of voids is a strongly decreasing function\nof void volume, which leads to a strongly sublinear depen-\ndence of the mean void volume on time. Thus, the theory of\nVillarica et al. does not describe our data quantitatively; no\nparameter values when input into the Smoluchowski theory\nwill give both the correct size distribution and time depen-\ndence.\nNow, in their calculations using a Smoluchowski-type\ntheory, Villarica et al. \u000331\u0004 did not assume that all voids at a\ngiven time have the same size \u0003as we did to obtain Eq. \u00013\u0002\u0004;\nhowever, they did assume that the rate at which two voids,\ncall them A and B, collide scales as VA\n\nVB\n\n\n, where VA and VB,\nare the volumes of voids A and B, respectively, and \n is an\nexponent. They also assumed that the coalescing objects\nwere in a spatially uniform system whose properties were not\nchanging with time. Our voids are embedded in a complex\nmatrix that is presumably changing with time as the soluble\ncomponent dissolves; thus the assumptions of spatial unifor-\nmity and time-independent collision rates may not be correct\nfor our system. We also do not know that the collision rates\nare power-law functions of volume.\nTo summarize, the conclusions of our comparison of the\ndata with the predictions of theory are as follows. Our obser-\nvation \u00012\u0002 is entirely consistent with coarsening occurring via\nair-void coalescence, although it is also consistent with Ost-\nwald ripening. Our observation \u00011\u0002, the log-normal distribu-\ntion, is also what we expect from coalescence, as is our ob-\nservation \u00013\u0002 that the volumes of four large voids seem to be\nquite static except that the volume of one suddenly de-\ncreases, seemingly as it loses volume to the adjacent void.\nWe conclude that coalescence via discrete events in which\nadjacent voids combine is consistent with all our observa-\ntions, although such coalescence events cannot be observed\nas they occur on length and time scales that are below the\nresolution of our experimental techniques. Also, the predic-\ntions of an existing theory for coalescence \u000331\u0004 do not agree\nquantitatively with our data. Further experiments and theo-\nretical calculations are needed to determine which of the as-\nsumptions made in theory are incorrect. Once we know this\nwe will have a better understanding of the coarsening dy-\nnamics.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nWe employed the complimentary techniques of magnetic\nresonance imaging and x-ray microcomputed tomography to\nimage the air voids in a polymer\u2013soluble-drug matrix ex-\nposed to a solvent \u0001water\u0002. The high spatial resolution of the\nx-ray \u0002CT system allowed us to obtain the air-void size\ndistribution as it changes over time. We observed that \u00011\u0002 the\nprobability distribution function of air voids is well fitted by\na log-normal distribution function, \u00012\u0002 the mean volume in-\ncreases linearly with time, and \u00013\u0002 there is evidence the vol-\nume of a void can suddenly collapse, presumably as its vol-\nume is distributed to adjacent voids. All these observations\nare consistent with coalescence of the air voids via rapid\ndiscrete events in which one void disappears or at least\nshrinks rapidly while a nearby void acquires its air. Observa-\ntions \u00011\u0002 and \u00013\u0002 are not compatible with the LSW mecha-\nnism of coarsening. Thus we conclude that coalescence pro-\nvides a physically reasonable description of our data. We\nnote that measuring just the time dependence of the mean\nvoid volume is not sufficient to distinguish between the LSW\nand coalescence models, as they both show this growth law.\nTherefore, an imaging technique, such as the MRI and x-ray\n\u0002CT, that enables the distribution function to be obtained is\nrequired. Our study is one of only a few in which this prob-\nability distribution function has been measured in situ and\nnondestructively.\nFuture work is required in order to more fully investigate\nthe mechanism of coarsening. A good test of understanding\nof a future model will be whether it can adequately explain\nthe observation that the voids form and coarsen in both re-\ngions: the region ahead of the front where water uptake is by\ncapillary action only and the region behind the front where\nthere is accompanying drug dissolution and therefore, pre-\nsumably, greater space for particle and void movement.\nVoids are unlikely to have a direct effect on the drug\ndissolution; motion of the air voids suggests a degree of\ninternal mobility in the tablets which might not otherwise be\npossible or noticed. Moreover, there is growing evidence that\nin porous media, vapor diffusion through pore spaces is a\nsignificant transport mechanism \u000332\u0004. It is possible that at\nleast in the early stages of water uptake, a vapor transport\nmechanism and voids could facilitate wetting of the internal\nKARAKOSTA et al.

Voids are also likely to be important to struc-\ntural integrity of the tablets.\nThe problem studied in this work is one of drug dissolu-\ntion. However, the methods developed and some of the con-\nclusions are likely to be widely applicable to water ingress\ninto compacted powders in general, for instance, solid deter-\ngent tablet dissolution and entrapped air in hydrating cement.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Malcolm Walden and Steven White-\nlock for useful discussions and help in the preparation of\nsamples.
