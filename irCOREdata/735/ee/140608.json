Introduction 25 \nEnvironmental risk assessment is an established feature of modern environmental decisions and has been used 26 \nsuccessfully to target risk management actions on the key drivers of risk across a range of anthropogenic and natural 27 \nhazards (European Environment Agency, 1998).  The basis of risk assessment (Vose, 2000) is an evaluation of the 28 \nconnectivity between the source of a hazard and an environmental receptor \u2013 something one wishes to protect.  Without 29 \na \u201cdose\u201d \u2013 an amount or duration of exposure to a harmful agent, there can be no harm at the receptor and one purpose 30 \n                                                 \n* Corresponding author: Tel: +44-1234-754101; fax: +44-751671 \nE-mail address: s.pollard@cranfield.ac.uk (S.J.T.Pollard) \n 2\nof risk assessment must, therefore, be to evaluate the likelihood and consequences of determining this harm.  Many 1 \nregulators now promote a tiered approach to risk assessment that allows for an initial screening and prioritisation of risk 2 \nprior to undertaking more detailed assessments (DETR et al., 2000).  This assists in ensuring that problems are well-3 \ndefined, that potential sources, pathways and receptors are comprehensively considered and that subsequent risk 4 \nassessment effort and resources are focussed on the key risks identified at a screening stage. 5 \nThe waste management sector applies risk assessment widely to issues such as the risks to groundwater from 6 \nlandfills (Environment Agency, 1996; Hall et al., 2003), the potential risks to human health from continuous stack 7 \nemissions (Harrop and Pollard, 1998; Eduljee, 2001) and to the potential health impacts from exposures to landfill gas 8 \n(Attenborough et al., 2002).  The development of conceptual models, site-specific exposure scenarios and application of 9 \nthe source-pathway-receptor approach (DETR et al., 2000; Environment Agency, 2000; WHO, 2000), supported by 10 \nquantitative analysis (Vose, 2000) where appropriate, is now commonplace.  Environmental risk tools are based upon 11 \nmodels that characterise pollutant pathways in open environmental systems and assume, or model, the release of the 12 \nsource of a hazard to the environment, be it through mechanisms such as liner failure, the episodic flux of emissions to 13 \nair, or diffusive flow through a landfill cap.  Modern groundwater risk assessments for landfills couple a performance 14 \nassessment of the liner system (Environment Agency, 2001; Hall et al., 2003) with a contaminant transport model to 15 \nassess potential risks to receptors such as downgradient abstraction boreholes (Figure 1).  The numerical approach to 16 \ncharacterising pathways of environmental exposure (e.g. groundwater dispersion or air diffusion) and modelling the 17 \ndistribution of contaminants in the environment, has proved powerful for the developers and operators of waste facilities 18 \nin securing environmental permits (Garrick, 2002). 19 \n 20\nFig. 1.  Basis for the combined performance and risk assessment of landfills and their potential impact on downgradient abstraction points, here by 21 \nreference to listed substances in the EC Groundwater Directive (Environment Agency, 2000). 22 \n 23 \nA shift within the sector towards waste process technologies, and the attending concerns raised about the 24 \npotential environmental harm (Dolk, 2002; Defra, 2004) that may result from routine, unmanaged or accidental releases 25 \nto the environment however, is forcing a widening of the portfolio of risk tools required (National Research Council, 26 \n2000; Environment Agency, 2000).  Furthermore, we are witnessing a more joined up approach to the assessment of 27 \nrisks from waste facilities (Environment Agency, 2004a), with a growing need to assess a larger set of causal events and 28 \nsubsequent exposures that might result in detrimental impacts - including issues of odour nuisance, exposure to trace 29 \n 3\ncomponents in landfill gas and to airborne microorganisms from biological waste treatment, losses in slope stability at 1 \nlandfills and risks from process failures in engineered systems.  This paper discusses these developments and attempts a 2 \nsynthesis of the role of risk assessment in the modern waste and resource management sector. 3 \n 4 \n1.1 Risk analysis tools 5 \nRisk assessment tools can be categorised by reference to the nature of the risk problem they are used to assess.  6 \nGenerally, risk analysts are concerned with three categories of risk problem that can be considered as part of a causal 7 \nchain of events (Pollard and Guy, 2001; Figure 2): 8 \n(i) source term risks associated with the risk of an initiating event or combination of events that deviate from normal 9 \noperating conditions and may result in a release to the environment (e.g. fire risk; the loss of flame at a pumped 10 \nlandfill gas flare unit; the catastrophic release of fire wash down from an on-site collection tank; the risk of mixing 11 \nincompatible wastes; a catastrophic landfill liner failure; inventory loss of treatment reagents or stored wastes; 12 \ninappropriate mixing of hazardous wastes during treatment; CIRIA, 1997); 13 \n(ii) pathway risks that address the likelihood of a certain exposure of an environmental receptor to a hazard following 14 \nan initial release (e.g. grounding of a plume downwind of an incinerator stack; movement of a leachate plume 15 \ntowards and abstraction point; off-site bioaerosol exposure from the turning of windrows at a composting facility; 16 \nPollard, 1999); and 17 \n(iii)  the risks of harm to receptors that might occur as a result of the exposure (e.g. adverse human or ecological health 18 \neffects as a result of exposure to toxic \/ asphyxiant gases; a toxic overload to biological wastewater treatment plant 19 \nas a result of a shock load of hazardous waste illegally disposed of to foul sewer; occupational health effects 20 \nexperienced by workers at enclosed composting facilities; needlestick injuries and their consequences to medical 21 \nwaste management operatives). 22 \nEach of these types of problem has associated with it certain categories of risk analysis tools (Figure 2) that 23 \ntend to dominate for the analysis in each case.  In part, because of the regulatory separation between health and safety 24 \nand environmental concerns, these tools have historically developed in isolation of one another with little connection 25 \nbetween the outputs of one analysis and the input requirements of another.  In the future, the integrated pollution and 26 \nprevention control will ensure that these aspects are more integrated. 27 \n 28 \nFig.2.  Basic typology of risk assessment tools and emphasis. 29 \n 4\n 1 \nRisk analysis tools are also available at a range of tiers of technical sophistication (qualitative, semi-2 \nquantitative, quantitative-deterministic, quantitative-probabilistic; DETR et al., 2000; Pollard et al., 2002) and, in 3 \ndeciding on the application of techniques, risk analysts need to consider both (i) the appropriate tool by reference to the 4 \ntype of risk problem being studied (Figure 2); and (ii) an appropriate level of sophistication selected as needs, 5 \ncomplexities, priorities and data allow (Pollard et al., 1995).  Changes occurring within the sector are likely to remove 6 \nthe historic barriers between these types of risk problem and their analysis.  New guidance for landfill operators in the 7 \nUK, for example (Environment Agency, 2004a), promotes assessing and presenting the risks for a site as a whole, rather 8 \nthan considering the significance of risks from individual hazards in isolation of one another.  This will allow operators 9 \nand regulators to focus on the priority risks to health and the environment and identify common research needs for the 10 \nimproved understanding of landfill process, for example.  Integrated pollution prevention and control is also forcing 11 \nconsideration of risk management at source (pollution prevention) as well as a comparative analysis of risks to the 12 \nmultimedia environment.  Under these developments, a broader set of risks (other than just to the aquatic and 13 \natmospheric environment) require analysis and comparison. 14 \n 15 \n2.  Developing a portfolio of risk analysis tools 16 \n2.1 Process risk analysis 17 \nIn the modern waste sector, much of the waste processing required prior to residuals management will occur in 18 \nengineered systems, with linked unit processes.  Whilst not at the scale or sophistication of the chemicals process sector, 19 \nwaste technologies adopt process engineering principles in their design and optimisation.  Here, material flows and mass 20 \nbalances are represented by process flowsheets (Figure 3) and system layout diagrams.  The performance of, and risks 21 \nfrom, unit processes can be assessed using tools such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and event tree 22 \nanalysis (ETA).  These tools, used widely in the chemical, oil, nuclear and water sectors, are increasingly applied to 23 \nwaste process flowsheets.  They offer the advantage of representing the process system in its entirety and allow 24 \nvulnerabilities to process failure to be assessed.  Though not infallible and requiring application with strict reference to 25 \noperational expertise (HSE, 2003), these tools can be used to infer the key routes of environmental exposure following a 26 \nrelease, providing the system is properly represented, and so inform the prioritisation of risk management actions, 27 \nincluding contingency planning in the future. One might reasonably imagine that some of the more common waste 28 \nmanagement facility incidents experienced in the UK (the inappropriate mixing of wastes during treatment, loss of 29 \n 5\nstored wastes to the aquatic environment) might have been avoided through the active adoption of process risk analysis 1 \nduring design, plant layout and operation. 2 \n 3 \nFig. 3.  Simplified process flowsheet for the two-step anaerobic degradation plant, Sobacken, Bor\u00e5s, Sweden for wet organic household waste (after 4 \nEcke et al., 1997).  The unit process sequence includes a mixing tank, a hydrolysis reactor, dewatering, a methanogenic filter and a nitrification tower.  5 \nThe plant started operation in 1995 with an annual capacity of ca. 9000 t of organic waste fraction.  The digestate is post-treated by composting. 6 \n 7 \nFault tree analyses select an undesired event (such as an engineering failure, a fire or an inadvertent mixing of 8 \nincompatible wastes) and trace it back to the possible system causes, which can be component failures, human error or 9 \nother factors that could lead to the undesired \u2018top\u2019 event.  The causes are related using Boolean logic relationships (i.e. 10 \nAND\/OR \u2018gates\u2019) to allow the root causes of the failure of the system to be identified and modelled (Figure 4).  Where 11 \nquality reliability data are available, quantitative FMEA allows conditional probabilities to be assigned to the various 12 \nfailure modes. 13 \n 14 \nFig. 4  Illustrative and qualitative fault-tree for release of compost liquor to groundwater at a composting plant showing AND and OR gates. 15 \n 16 \nThe nuclear sector has made long-standing and extensive use of FMEA in its performance assessments of radioactive 17 \nwaste repositories (Watts, 2001; BNFL, 2002) and some of these engineering risk tools are now being applied to 18 \nconventional hazardous waste management facilities in the US and Europe (Garrick, 2002; Shaw et al., 2002). 19 \nIn contrast, event tree analysis starts with the initiating event (e.g. the failure of a leachate treatment system, the 20 \nrelease of a cloud of hazardous gas; the overflow of an oil\/water interceptor) and sets out the onward consequences of 21 \nthe release \u2013 the environmental consequences of a process accident, for example.  As with many risk techniques, fault 22 \nand event tree analyses require process data to quantify the contributory causes and consequences and their contingent 23 \nprobabilities, though both may be used qualitatively.  Data can be difficult to source and quantification relies on expert 24 \njudgments made on the basis of performance data and long-standing operational expertise.  Event tree analysis is seeing 25 \nparticular use for quantitative microbial risk assessment (Figure 4); for example, in the assessment of pathogenic risks 26 \nfrom the disposal of sewage sludge to land on which crops may be grown for human consumption (Gale, 2001), in 27 \nassessing the pathogenic risks of composting of meat-containing catering wastes, and in assessing the potential risks to 28 \nhuman health from the disposal and onward environmental fate of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) 29 \n 6\nagents (Hirschhorn, 1999; BRS, 2001; WRc, 1998; Figure 5).  Whilst offering presentational clarity, however, the 1 \napplication of tools used conventionally for closed engineered systems to open environmental settings has its limitations, 2 \nin that a certain uniformity of structure is imposed on the fate and transport of agents within the environment.  The 3 \nconstruction of event trees for environmental exposures is open to conceptual bias in this sense and one must be 4 \nespecially cautious of quantitative tools in this regard, because mass balances treated as single \u2018legs\u2019 in an event tree 5 \nmay in reality be dispersed among several environmental compartments. 6 \n 7 \nFig. 5  Illustrative event tree for of the fate of infective doses (ID) of pathogenic agents during the proposed rendering of over thirty month scheme 8 \n(OTMS) material in a fictitious rendering plant (adapted from WRc, 1998, used with permission) 9 \n 10 \nThe requirements of the European Council (EC) Landfill Directive (1999\/31\/EC) on the progressive reduction 11 \nof biodegradable waste, the growth in waste processing and the additional requirement under integrated pollution, 12 \nprevention and control to assess the risks of accidents and their consequences for waste management installations are 13 \nlikely to encourage greater use of risk tools for assessing process failures (e.g. of leachate treatment plant, of gas 14 \ncollection and combustion systems, of emissions control equipment) and the significance of risks from combined 15 \nhazards, such as from flooding at hazardous waste storage treatment facilities.  In this regard, hazard and operability 16 \n(HAZOP) tools for assessing process safety, and hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) frameworks for 17 \nidentifying risk-critical points in multi-unit systems can also be applied to waste processing.  The latter approach, 18 \nadapted from the food technology literature and reviewed for the water sector in this volume, features in European 19 \nproposals for the management of pathogenic hazards from biosolids (Godfree, 2001) and composting practices under 20 \nproposed European legislation. 21 \n 22 \n2.2 Environmental exposures and risk 23 \nEnvironmental systems are open, complex, dynamic and heterogeneous.  Risks to and from the environment are 24 \ndetermined within a combined spatial and temporal context.  Models of the environment for its analysis (Schnoor, 1996) 25 \noften belie this reality but, in simplifying the system, offer the benefit of rational analysis within the confines of the 26 \nmodel constructed.  Using conceptual models it is possible to assess exposures within the system boundaries and 27 \npostulate the relative probabilities of exposure mediated through environmental systems.  In doing so, risk analysts aim 28 \nto identify and prioritise key routes of exposure and, where exposures are found to be unacceptable, propose 29 \n 7\nmanagement responses accordingly.  Given the complexity involved, practitioners often resort to numerical approaches 1 \nthat allow subtle distinctions between the drivers of exposure to be explored by sensitivity analyses.  Conventionally, but 2 \nby no means universally, quantitative risk assessment is reserved for exposures that are already deemed significant. 3 \nWith respect to the exposure dose, the magnitude, frequency, timing and duration of exposure are important 4 \nconcepts in determining the extent of potential harm from waste processing operations.  The presence and maintenance 5 \nof barriers (physical, engineered, biological, environmental, behavioural) to exposure can often be important in 6 \nminimising public health risks and when removed or bypassed by accident or design, can dramatically increase the 7 \nlikelihood of exposure by orders of magnitude.  Examples might include the ingress of gas into buildings through poor 8 \nservice pipe installations, poor liner welds in engineered landfill liners, an absence of security to land contaminated with 9 \nhazardous waste.  Direct pathways involve exposure to the medium in which the source resides\u2013 the direct inhalation of 10 \nhazardous vapours, for example.  Indirect pathways usually involve transport of the source between media, such as the 11 \nleaching of contaminants from a landfill site through permeable strata to a groundwater aquifer, or the carry over of 12 \npersistent compounds through the various unit processes of a poorly performing leachate treatment works.  Whilst 13 \nconcern is usually reserved for direct exposures through inhalation and ingestion routes, risks may be driven by direct or 14 \nindirect exposure to the source of the hazard. 15 \nDispersion modelling is one approach to quantifying the spatial extent of exposures to the wider environment 16 \nfrom a point or area source.  Human health and amenity risk assessments that assess the impacts of odour and particles 17 \ndownwind of landfills and other operating installations adopt such approaches (Hester and Harrison, 2002; Taha and 18 \nPollard, 2004).  Many treatment processes such as windrow composting and the bioremediation of organic wastes emit 19 \nodours, bioaerosols and\/or volatiles (Steinheider et al., 1998).  The off-site impacts of these hazards are conventionally 20 \nassessed by reference to exposure point concentrations or doses experienced by a receptor at distance from the source.  21 \nFigure 6 illustrates this type of assessment used in support of an environmental statement, where odour unit 22 \nconcentrations are specified as a percentile of total hours in the year to interpret levels of annoyance that could be 23 \nexperienced by a local population.  Risk assessments for bioaerosols, dust, and odour frequently have to account for the 24 \nsignificance of such impacts by defining permissible emission limits at source, through back-calculation, or reverse 25 \nmodelling of an exposure point concentration.  As with noise limit models, these approaches attempt to define maximum 26 \npermissible levels by accounting for the existing baseline of impacts from other nearby sources as well as the 27 \nincremental impacts from the facility in question.  Disaggregating these individual contributions is methodically 28 \ncomplex and frequently not possible. 29 \n 8\n 1 \nFig. 6.  The application of distribution models in exposure assessment for amenity risk assessment.  Map shows contours of increasing odour units (ou; 2 \nfrom outer contours, inward) of 1, 3, 5 ou\/m3, presented here as boundaries beyond which values are not exceeded for more than 2% of the time 3 \n(Shanks Waste Services, 2003; location plan reproduced from the revised 1998 Ordnance Survey 1:50 000 Landranger map No. 153 with the 4 \npermission of the Controller of Her Majesty\u2019s Stationery Office, \u00a9 Crown copyright.) 5 \n 6 \nControlling detrimental impacts from pollutants is further complicated where exposure limits are not defined but where 7 \nannoyance impacts may still be significant.  The need to assess the significance of low concentrations of pollutants in the 8 \nambient environment is especially evident where impacts on local amenity arise, because communities may assume that 9 \npresence of an odour confirms exposure to hazardous compounds.  Risk-based approaches, evident within the 10 \nforthcoming European Directive on Noise, provide a consistent policy for operators to define process design standards.  11 \nHarmonised approaches using risk tools to inform odour management plans are being established across international 12 \ncompanies (Senate et al., 2004) and promoted during policy development (Van Broeck, 2004). 13 \nModelling the environmental distribution of contaminants from waste management facilities has highlighted the 14 \nsusceptibility of environmental risk assessments to the availability and quality of data on source terms (Environment 15 \nAgency, 2004b).  Notwithstanding the widely acknowledged difficulties encountered in measuring releases from these 16 \ntypes of facility, bioaerosol, gas and vapour emissions at waste installations are frequently episodic (rather than 17 \ncontinuous) and often related to operational process cycles, diurnal and daily fluctuations in air temperature and pressure 18 \nor phase changes in contaminant behaviour (Rabl and Spadaro, 2002).  Under these circumstances, conventional 19 \ndispersion models may prove inappropriate for estimating off-site exposures (Hobbs et al., 2003; Taha and Pollard, 20 \n2004) especially over short distances and may require amendment. 21 \nWithin regulatory  risk assessment, there is a need to scrutinise the total mass balance of waste systems and 22 \naccount for total losses to the full set of environmental compartments, so that while one aspect of the impact is fully 23 \nassessed (and regulated), other pathways are not inadvertently ignored (e.g. Mills et al., 2004).  For example, the impact 24 \non groundwater of new landfills rarely assesses the other routes that contaminants might take, such as bulk flows to a 25 \ntreatment plant, volatile emissions to the atmosphere, or discharges to surface water.  The single environmental 26 \ncompartment approach historically adopted by many risk assessments has been in response to regulation of the specific 27 \nreceiving body (groundwater, surface water, air), but in future, risk assessments for waste installations under integrated 28 \npollution prevention and control will adopt a more integrated approach, that views potential impacts by reference to 29 \n 9\nmultimedia (air, water, land, biota) routes of exposure (Environment Agency, 2004a) to a range of receptors within the 1 \nenvironmental setting.  Further, with the emphasis now firmly on pollution prevention, risk assessments can be expected 2 \nto better inform preventative pollution strategies and risk management plans rather than focusing on the impacts of 3 \nreleases post-event. 4 \nUnderstanding the temporal aspects of exposure is equally important \u2013 for example, characterising the long 5 \nterm risks to the environment during the management of treatment residuals and understanding the episodic nature of 6 \nexposures, highlighted above.  The sustainable development agenda has forced a consideration of intergenerational 7 \ntimeframes within the performance assessment of the engineered landfill environment, with 30 years being frequently 8 \nconsidered as a regulatory benchmark for risks into the future.  Whilst knowledge of leachates from conventional 9 \n(largely municipal solid waste co-disposal) landfill sites in the UK is considerable, the UK has far less experience at 10 \nhand to inform the management of risks associated with leachate from post-Landfill Directive sites (Environment 11 \nAgency, 2004b).  Unlike several EU Member States, where national legislation has required alternatives to landfill for a 12 \nnumber of years, the UK has not relied heavily on incineration and mechanical and biological pre-treatment.  The 13 \nexpectation is that post-Landfill Directive sites will be characterised by significantly reduced degradable carbon loadings 14 \nand dominated by chemical rather than biological processes, but there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the 15 \ncharacterisation of environmental fate processes, emissions and long-term risks.  Adaptation of risk analysis approaches 16 \nused elsewhere in radioactive waste performance assessment however, is demonstrating that much longer management 17 \ntimescales than those considered to date are likely to be relevant (Figure 7).  When the long term fate of contaminants in 18 \nlandfill is modelled beyond the current regulatory requirement of 30 years, extended periods of operational and 19 \ninstitutional control may be required (Hall et al., 2004). 20 \n 21 \nFig.7. Estimated management period of 340 y for a non-flushing landfill accepting raw municipal solid wastes (MSW) 22 \nand meeting the water quality standard (WQS) for lead at a groundwater receptor (after Hall et al., 2004) 23 \n 24 \nHall et al. (2004) suggest that for true landfill equilibrium status, where each and every contaminant in the 25 \nlandfill environment meets a required assessment endpoint, that maximum management periods in excess of 2000 years 26 \nfor persistent contaminants in certain residues may be required.  These timescales raise important regulatory and 27 \noperational issues over operational, post-operational, post-closure and post-institutional control periods and the timing 28 \nand nature of regulatory interventions for managing risk.  Drawing on decades of international experience in the 29 \n 10\ndevelopment of safety cases for radioactive waste repositories (Nuclear Energy Authority, 1999), Yearsley and 1 \nSummerling (2002) conclude: 2 \n\u2022 The possibility of impacts arising in the far future is an inevitable consequence of the decision to concentrate 3 \nand contain waste.  The observation that any repository can be sited and designed such that significant impacts 4 \nare estimated to only occur at very long times in the future is a positive feature and measure of success of the 5 \nwaste management solution. 6 \n\u2022 No single time scale is likely to be acceptable to all audiences of a risk assessment or for all the motivations 7 \nthat underlie the use of long timescales.  Safety cases need to use different arguments, lines of evidence and 8 \ncalculations at different timescales to provide confidence. 9 \n\u2022 Common sense should be exercised in the presentation of risks over extended time periods and if results to long 10 \ntimescales are presented then the associated uncertainties and their interpretation should be explained. 11 \n\u2022 Dialogue with the wider scientific community and the public could inform the safety case and the time scales 12 \nadopted.  Whilst the public is recognised a heterogeneous group that will bring a wide range of personal values 13 \nto any dialogue process, such dialogue might lead to different emphases on the time scales adopted in safety 14 \nassessments, possibly with less emphasis on extremely long time scales (100 000 years for radioactive waste). 15 \nThese observations offer important lessons for the non-radioactive waste community as they formulate the approach to 16 \nassessing exposures in the long term and the consequences and timing of environmental harm.  The adoption of 17 \nintegrated waste management that delivers the waste hierarchy would likely address the health risks associated with 18 \nindividual waste management options (South West Public Health Observatory, 2002), through process control.  But this 19 \nalso requires the segregation and treatment of waste at co-located facilities, and risk management upstream in the 20 \nprocess cycle.  Many of the risks that arise in the latter stage of the process cycle, i.e. during waste management, are a 21 \nconsequence of actions taken at earlier stages of design, production, packaging and marketing.  Ultimately, chemical 22 \nhazards from waste residues must be managed at source through the elimination of hazardous components from the 23 \ndesign process. 24 \n 25 \n2.3 Environmental harm 26 \nFor environmental receptors, the risk of potential environmental harm following a release (accidental or 27 \nconsented) and a subsequent exposure (Figure 2) is characterised by the dose-response curve (Figure 8) - the relationship 28 \n 11\nbetween the exposure to or intake of a hazardous agent and its toxicological (or chemical, or physical) effect on the 1 \nreceptor (Dolk, 2002). 2 \n 3 \nFig. 8.  The dose-response curve determines the relationship between exposure (amount or duration) and the harm manifest at the receptor.  Dose-4 \nresponse curves have varying (i) gradients representing the potency of the hazard per unit exposure; (ii) points of departure from the x-axis, 5 \nrepresenting threshold or non-threshold behaviour (or latency where expressed in terms of exposure duration); and (iii) reversibility, representing 6 \nsystem recovery as exposure ceases. From Pollard et al 2004  7 \n 8 \nDose response curves embody both the likelihood and consequences of an effect given that an amount (dose) or duration 9 \n(time) of exposure occurs.  The potency of a hazard on individual receptors is understood by reference to the gradient of 10 \ndose-response relationship, in that for the same amount of exposure, different sources of a hazard can pose different 11 \nlevels of harm.  With respect to sensitivity, some receptors are less resilient to hazards than others.  This could be 12 \nbecause of their sensitivity to the specific hazard or because they are vulnerable by their very nature.  With respect to the 13 \nmagnitude of harm manifest following exposure, we often consider the number of receptors at risk \u2013 the population, or 14 \n\u2018stock at risk\u2019.  Consequences are generally considered to be more significant if a large population of receptors is at risk 15 \nrather than a small number.  This may not be universally applied, however, as we may attach substantial value to even a 16 \nsmall number of receptors: single representative habitats, for example. 17 \nThe requirements of the EC Seveso II (COMAH) Directive to large waste management installations and of the 18 \nEC Habitats Directive to licensed facilities act as specific drivers for broadening the emphasis of risk management to the 19 \noff-site receptor (e.g. ecosystem) components of the environment and considering the implications of ecological harm 20 \n(DETR, 1998, 1999).  Furthermore, changes to the human population profile in many countries (increased age, more 21 \nimmunosuppressed people and sensitised sub-populations) have given rise to a greater awareness of sensitive and 22 \nvulnerable sub-populations.  The emphasis for receptor-focused risk studies is on assessing the significance of potential 23 \nharm at the receptor.  This is not trivial and for ecosystems in particular, there is a wide ranging debate over the level at 24 \nwhich serious impairment to ecosystem function should be assessed (Smith et al., 2004) and, for human receptors at 25 \nwhat level (95%, 99% of the populations) protection should and can be afforded. 26 \n 27 \n3.  Integrated risk assessment for multiple receptors 28 \nThe future of risk analysis for waste management installations is likely to focus on (i) assessing an expanded set 29 \nof hazardous circumstances (slope stability, landfill gas, hazardous trace components, issues of odour, risks from unit 30 \n 12\nprocesses, combined events, such as flooding and inventory loss) from individual facilities; (ii) on aggregated risks at 1 \nintegrated, multi-process facilities; and (iii) on the integration of risks that have historically been assessed singularly by 2 \nreference to individual legislative demands (e.g. Waste Management Licensing (UK), EC Groundwater Directive, EC 3 \nHabitats Directive).  Whilst integration is to be welcomed, its implementation will raise a number of technical and 4 \npractical challenges for risk analysts, operators and regulators, including: 5 \n\u2022 a step change in the complexity and likely costs of risk work required of operators; 6 \n\u2022 the need for commensurate regulatory appraisal of risk assessments submitted in support of environmental 7 \npermits and, arguably an independent assessment function; 8 \n\u2022 increased challenges to operators and regulators over the communication of risks to multiple receptors and their 9 \nrelative importance; 10 \n\u2022 the development and application of new skills in process risk modelling and ecological risk assessment; 11 \n\u2022 new metrics for the aggregation of risks from multiple technologies and the comparison of risks between 12 \ndistinct endpoints; 13 \n\u2022 heightened awareness and likely discussion of the potential risks to human health from waste management 14 \nactivities; 15 \n\u2022 debates about the complex issues involved in comparing risks to different receptors and definitions of risk 16 \nsignificance; and 17 \n\u2022 deciding on appropriate timescales for risk assessments. 18 \n 19 \nMany of these challenges are not new, have been worked through elsewhere internationally and do not require a priori 20 \ntreatment.  However, with a more complex picture on the assessment of risk from waste management installations and 21 \nthe increased application of these tools upstream within the decision process during planning, there is a need for a \u2018route 22 \nmap\u2019 detailing the relative positioning of various tools within the broad context of environmental legislation. 23 \n 24 \n4.  Risk analysis: from strategic to project risk 25 \nFinally, risk analysis is increasingly being used beyond the site-specific project level within (i) the strategic 26 \nplanning of projects; and (ii) for the assessment of risks to and from policies, programmes and plans of work, in a 27 \nsimilar way to many environmental appraisal tools (Pollard, 2001).  This shift recognizes that decisions made at the site-28 \n 13\nspecific level often flounder because of inadequacies in strategic waste planning.  Risk assessment becomes fundamental 1 \nto all phases of the development of waste management facilities.  At the strategic \u2018macro\u2019 scale, risk assessments inform 2 \nstrategic decisions about land use planning relying on zoning and vulnerability maps.  At an \u2018intermediate\u2019 scale, risk 3 \nassessments underpin an assessment of the potential impacts associated with a facility\u2019s environmental setting, 4 \nconsidered through the development planning process.  At the project-specific (\u2018micro\u2019 scale) and in the context of 5 \nenvironmental permitting, risk assessment is used to enable the operator and regulator to identify the risk management 6 \noptions required to prevent, control, minimise and\/or mitigate the risks to the local environment, these becoming 7 \nstipulated as permit conditions.  The increased use of risk assessments at the strategic and development planning stages, 8 \nusually in support of environmental impact assessments and statements, raises issues about the interface between the 9 \nassessments submitted at these stages and, where effort is best placed for the benefit of improving overall decisions. 10 \nThe planning regime generally seeks to avoid commentary on issues that are the preserve of the environmental 11 \npermitting process although for practitioners, there is merit in developing risk assessments from the strategic to the 12 \nproject level as the site-specificities become clearer.  There is a natural progression in the detail and sophistication of 13 \nassessment as development proceeds.  In this context, the spatial dimension of risk is increasingly recognised, and as 14 \nnational, regional and sub-regional waste strategies progress towards implementation and the logistics of waste 15 \nmovements and the siting of new facilities is discussed, the spatial and temporal profile of risks from the new facilities 16 \nwill require analysis. 17 \n 18 \n5.  Conclusions 19 \n Risk-based decision making in waste management is increasingly used outside the established sectors 20 \nof landfill and hazardous wastes (Milke, 2003).  Integrated environmental regulation is leading to risk-based approaches 21 \nbeing adopted for site management and the setting of priorities for regulatory inspection (DETR, 1999; Environment 22 \nAgency, 2004c).  However, with increased emphasis on risk-based regulation, a tension exists for practitioners 23 \n(Tromans, 2004) because concurrent with this expansion is a growing call for simpler, quicker and less costly risk 24 \nassessments.  Balancing the practical value of risk-informed decisions against the resources required to complete 25 \ncomplex studies must rank among our future research priorities.  Reflecting on current practice, however, we conclude 26 \nthat: 27 \n\u2022 recent developments in the sector offer a pivotal opportunity to review the application of decision tools for 28 \nthose responsible for managing risk; 29 \n 14\n\u2022 a more diverse palette of risk tools is required for decision makers wishing to optimise risk management at 1 \nwaste facilities; 2 \n\u2022 many of these tools can be \u2018read across\u2019 from other disciplines and tailored for the waste sector\u2019s needs (Milke, 3 \n2003); 4 \n\u2022 in terms of developing an integrated suite of tools, analogues already exist in the radioactive waste community 5 \nfor the prioritisation of source-pathway-receptor linkages; 6 \n\u2022 tools for the aggregate and comparative assessment of risks from various waste management options are 7 \nrequired by decision-makers optimizing the delivery of a mix of management options co-located at single 8 \nintegrated facilities; 9 \n\u2022 comparative and integrated options appraisal tools exist for the relative evaluation of environmental, social and 10 \nfinancial risk (Pollard et al., 2004) that have direct application within the waste sector. 11 \n\u2022 integrated risk assessments addressing, and allowing the prioritisation of, the risks to a range of environmental 12 \nreceptors are likely to represent the future; 13 \n\u2022 benefits to be seized include the reduced costs of gaining environmental permits, improved regulatory and 14 \npublic confidence and the development of a sound and structured approach to managing environmental risk 15 \nwithin the sector; and 16 \n\u2022 sound and well-informed risk management is critical to securing confidence in, and establishing new 17 \ntechnologies in a rapidly developing marketplace. 18 \n 19 \n 15\nReferences 1 \nAttenborough, G.; Hall, DH.; Gregory, RG.; McGoochan, L.
