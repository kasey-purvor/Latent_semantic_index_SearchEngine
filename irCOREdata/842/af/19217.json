A partnership developed in the mid \n1990s between the UK\u2019s Birmingham Royal Ballet and the University of Birmingham, \nWesthill (now School of Education), to provide a part-time, post-experience, flexible study \nprogramme for full-time Company dancers. This is the first \u2018company customised\u2019 higher \neducation programme to dovetails studies around rehearsal, performance and touring \nschedules.

A partnership between \nBirmingham Royal Ballet (BRB) and the University of Birmingham, led to the first \ncustomised higher education opportunity for dancers in the UK\u2019s second largest ballet \ncompany. The considerable knowledge and skills gained in the training and professional \nlives of leading ballet artists would be recognised as a spring-board for entering higher \neducation on a part-time, post-experience programme. The only way in which the \naspirations of these full-time dancers to enter higher education could be met would be \nthrough 'customised' delivery, dovetailed with the schedule of the Company:  \n \nNo other large professional dance company in the world offers its members the \noption of participating in a course of study tailored to fit the demands of a \nperforming company.  \nClarke (1997:19)  \n \nAlthough there have been other examples of access opportunities for professional dancers \nto higher education programmes, for example Fordham College New York (Bristow, \n1998), access to programmes and customised provision are not the same. This paper \nfocuses on the first five years of the BRB \/ Birmingham University partnership since the \nprogramme\u2019s inception in 1997. It is a narrative by the author, that is an account informed \n 4\nby the personal experiences of being programme leader, and by primary and secondary \nsources which were: interviews with dancers (coded D1 \u2013 D12), and senior Company \nmanagers, documentation such as letters and written evaluations, and other published work \nfocusing on the programme.    \n \nNARRATIVE RESEARCH \nThe increasing popularity of narratives in social science research opens new opportunities \nfor research methods, and textual forms (Richardson, 2000, Denzin and Linclon, 2000, \nSparkes, 2002). For example, method developments encourage greater reflexivity, that is \ninterpretation of experiences, reflection on the importance of position, historical and \ncultural situation, personal investments and biases in the research. The emergence of new \ntextual forms have resulted from increased awareness of the importance of \u2018product\u2019 in \nresearch and what Denzin and Lincoln (2000) call the fifth, sixth and seventh moments of \ntwentieth century development in qualitative research: experimental, postexperimental and \nfuture moments. Sparkes (2002) calls this the \u2018shifting social science landscape of recent \nyears\u2019 resulting in increasing acceptance of diverse forms with:  \u201c\u2026 confessional tales, \nautoethnographies, poetic representations, ethnodrama and ethnographic fiction as \nalternative and legitimate ways for qualitative researchers to represent their findings\u201d \n(Sparkes 2002:3). One problem is that rates of acceptance of new ideas into the well-\nguarded ranks of academia vary and whilst Denzin and Lincoln (2000) regard them as well \nestablished in sociology and anthropology, the rate of change has not been as rapid in all \ndisciplines (Ibid:7). But, researchers have been exploring new territories, writing authors \n\u2018into\u2019 instead of \u2018out of\u2019 texts and confronting contentious issues such as representation \nand legitimization. Bochner (2001: 134 \u2013 135) captures the essence of the \u2018narrative turn\u2019: \n \n 5\n                                                          \nThe narrative turn moves from a singular, monolithic conception of social science \ntoward a pluralism that promotes multiple forms of representation and research; \naway from facts and towards meanings; away from master narratives and toward \nlocal stories; away from idolizing categorical thought and abstracted theory and \ntoward embracing the values of irony, emotionality, and activism; away from \nassuming the stance of disinterested spectator and toward assuming the posture of a \nfeeling, embodied, and vulnerable observer; away from writing essays and toward \ntelling stories.   \n \nSuch challenge to traditional research conventions has not happened without criticism. It \nlegitimises the use of \u2018I\u2019, single case studies, is not generalizeable, can be akin to \nbiography, blurs the boundaries between social science and literature and stresses the \njourney rather than analysis, explanation or theorising (Ellis and Bochner 2000). But \ncompeting discourses and growing acceptance1 is creating new spaces for researchers, \nwhich bring both opportunity and challenge. Whilst this paper does not stray too far from a \nmore traditional \u2018realist tale\u2019 (Van Maanan, 1988, Sparkes 2002), using inductive analysis \nin which perspectives of others are most visible, it does include elements of \u2018narrative of \nthe self\u2019 or  \n \n \n \n\u2018autoethnography\u2019 which recognise the lived experiences of the author.  As Ellis and  \nBochner (2000:746) suggest: \u201cLife and narrative are inextricably connected. Life both \nanticipates telling and draws meaning from it. Narrative is both about living and part of it.\u201d   \n \n 6\n                                                                                                                                                                               \n \nThe intention of using predominantly inductive analysis in this realist tale was to \nstrengthen the account of the journey through breadth of perspectives. Acknowledging the \nposition of the author as leader of the degree programme, totally immersed in its design, \nimplementation and evaluation at all stages of the journey through the last five years \nhopefully enriches the reality of the narrative. Two key factors related to the significance \nof the dancers\u2019 degree programme were identified at the launch of the course by \nBannerman (1997: 161):  \n \nThe first is to note the great changes in education which have allowed this degree \nto be developed. Higher education has grown to embrace dance as a valid and \nvaluable part of human knowledge. The second is to recognise the importance of \nthis initiative for the development of dance in Britain, in particular for the \ndevelopment of ballet as an Art form and as an activity with value as an agent of \nlearning and of personal development. \n \n \nCONTEXT \n \nThere is much political good-will currently for notions of widening participation, lifelong \nlearning and continuing professional development (CPD), including the Arts world. Ballet \ndancers often make vocational choices around the age of eleven years from which time \nmaximising performance capability denies traditional entry into further or higher \neducation. Early dance specialisation has been criticised for being: \u201ctoo narrow and \n \n1 For example through academic journals: \u2018Qualitative Inquiry\u2019, The Sociological Quarterly\u2019, International \nJournal of Qualitative Studies in Education\u2019, Journal of Contemporary Ethnography\u2019, \u2018Qualitative \nSociology\u2019, \u2018Qualitative Studies in Psychology\u2019 and Qualitative Research\u2019 cited Sparkes (2002:2). \n 7\ntechnical in focus and (tending) to ignore the wider personal development of the \nindividual\u201d (Birch 1998: 44). Then, once dancers make it into the profession, career \npatterns are \u2018high risk\u2019 in terms of stability of jobs, injury, and sustainability. Re-\nemployment opportunities within companies are limited and the majority of dancers are \nfaced with finding new beginnings in identity and life direction. (Ibid.) These moments can \nlead to feelings of exclusion, loss of sense of purpose and financial insecurity. Dancers are \nforced to leave behind the \u2018all-consuming\u2019 passion for performance that they needed to \nreach the top as dancers in the first place. Succeeding in continuing education, becoming \ninterested in learning, can help to move  \npeople through difficult life phases, since education\u2019s: \u201c\u2026 agenda of empowerment is \nimportant for everyone, at all ages and life circumstances.\u201d Carlton and Soulsby (1999:11). \nMany dancers do not have positive self-esteem or feelings of empowerment. The dance \nprofession, particularly ballet, is much criticised for traditional training methods that do \nnot empower learners (Buckroyd 2000). Dancers, then, have much to gain from new \nopportunities in education, and through them the dance world can benefit. Training for the \nballet profession demands a dedication and focus often belied by the beauty and efficiency \nof the artists\u2019 skills. 'Outsiders', those who have never experienced the rigour of the art \nform's technical and artistic demands, rarely fully appreciate the years of commitment and \nextraordinary lifestyles of these people. Dancers who are successful might consider their \ncommitment to be well rewarded in terms of an exciting career, sense of achievement, \nnational and international status and global opportunities. But, with the exception of \nbiographies produced for commercial interest, little is known about dancers\u2019 \u2018insider\u2019 life-\nexperiences or post-career opportunities. It is rare for professional dancers to enter the \nrealms of critical, reflective thinking fostered in higher education, yet this is a direction \nwhich has the greatest potential to impact on a traditionally silent world.  \n \n 8\nAs is evidenced in this paper, entry into higher education can make a difference by \nimproving dancers\u2019 life chances, through empowerment, post-performing career \nopportunities and personal development, as well as enhancing the education and arts world \nin positive ways.  \n \n \nDEVISING THE PROGRAMME \n \nThe idea began with the head of education at Birmingham Royal Ballet in the mid 1990s. \nShe saw her role as, not only to disseminate the work of the Company via the traditional \neducation and community routes, but reciprocally, to bring educational opportunities in for \nthe continuing personal, and professional, development of Company members (Hackett \n1998:4).  \n \nThe course content was negotiated between staff at the University and BRB, to utilise and \nextend the dancers' 'work-place' knowledge whilst extending them in broader intellectual \ndirections. The structure for the course was built on an existing University framework for \npart-time, post-experience study, originally devised for non-graduate teachers, the \nAdvanced Certificate in Education (one year of study), Bachelor of Philosophy (two \nyears), and Master of Arts (three years) degree framework. The rationale of the programme \nwas to enable working artists to develop and apply their considerable knowledge and \nexperience to issues beyond the professional theatre, for example in education and \ncommunity contexts. The first year was planned to focus on three modules that related to \nthe work of the education department: dance in education, dance in the community and a \nproject-led outreach dance module. In the second year the programme was designed to \nchallenge these essentially practitioner-based professionals to apply academic disciplines \n 9\nsuch as philosophy of the arts, sociology and empirical research techniques, to increasing \nknowledge and understanding of their much under-researched professional world.  \n \n \nCOHORTS \n \nTen dancers embarked on the programme in 1997. The cohort included representation from \nacross ranks in the Company from Artist to Principal dancers, five men and five women, \nfour Americans and six English dancers. Years in the profession ranged from 6 to 22 with \na wealth of transnational experience including San Francisco Ballet, Dance Theatre \nHarlem, New York and Stuttgart Ballet. Some had been with Sadlers Wells Royal Ballet \nprior to the re-location when the company became The Birmingham Royal Ballet in 1990. \nIt was a remarkable achievement of stability in an unstable world that all ten dancers \nstayed for the full three years. The second cohort started in 2000 with eleven students and \na wider \u2018international field\u2019 including dancers from Romania, Italy, Austria, Spain, \nAmerica, Australia, Poland, Scotland, England and China. The second cohort has used the \nflexibility of the degree structure more diversely. Three left early in the first year for \ndifferent personal reasons, one of them joining Rambert Dance Company. Two students \ntook the ACE qualification after the first year, one because her career was developing \nrapidly with many new opportunities, the other because he wanted to use the credit \ncertificate to join a distance learning sports programme with an American University. His \npost-performing ambitions lay outside the dance world:  \n \nI took on the programme because I was a high school drop-out and needed a \npassport into further education \u2026 my goal has been accomplished. I have found \nthis course incredibly valuable and beneficial to me \u2026   (D11) \n 10\n \nTwo other dancers are finishing at the B.Phil level this October as they both move into new \ncareers and three are continuing for their Masters year. \n \n \n REFLECTIONS ON THE PROGRAMME \n \nAs programme leader, finding a way through the demands of managing a customised \nprogramme has been challenging and rewarding. For example, it has been challenging to \nrespond to the inevitable crisis management that happens in the Arts world, to a schedule \nthat bears no resemblance to traditional academic years and to unusual student-working \npatterns that demand tutor flexibility. The degree studies are managed around the \nCompany\u2019s Birmingham based rehearsal and performance schedules as well as the regular \nnational and international touring schedules which have included Bradford, Plymouth, \nSunderland and Salford, South Africa, Hong Kong and America, since 1997.  \n \nIt has been rewarding to witness, for both cohorts, the dancers\u2019 rapid development in \nconfidence, mastery of skills such as oral presentations, assignment writing and ICT, \ndevelopment as critical and reflective thinkers and abilities to contribute in new and \nexciting ways to both their Company and the wider world. What I will remember most is \nthe privilege of coming to know and respect a group of people totally dedicated to their \ncareers with a capacity for work that seems unparalleled. \n \nFor the students, without doubt the opportunity to focus on dance in education and \ncommunity contexts changed the way in which they appreciated the value of artists \n 11\ninvolved in outreach projects and ways in which the lives of others can be enhanced \nthrough access to their art form:  \n \nI think the 'applied dance' nature of the course has given us the knowledge of how \nimportant dance is in different contexts. You (as a dancer) are aware that it exists \nbut barely where it exists and certainly not why it exists. I think understanding \noutreach work has changed for me. If someone had asked me what its purpose was \n(the Education Department at BRB) I would have said at one time - 'To develop \nfuture audiences'- it would have been as basic as that before the course, and I think \nthat would have been the opinion of a large chunk of the Company. (D8) \n \nI'd done education work for three or four years and suddenly you realise why you \nare doing it and how it came about .... And being able to write what you are \nthinking \u2013 to formalise your thoughts  ... to have opinions and to be able to speak \nthem too - and not be scared to say what you think ... because as a dancer you don't \n- you say things with your body - you are used as a piece of putty for the Company \n-just a body really - not actually free-thinking individuals \u2026 (D10)  \n \nSome of the most popular aspects of the course have been those that provided different \nframeworks and perspectives with which to view their art form, career and lifestyle. \nBeginning philosophical interrogation of important questions related to the value of the \nArts, and exploring relationships between art forms, gave dancers time and space to reflect \non more generic issues shared by the arts.  \n \nThey also enjoyed the introduction to using sociological frameworks, with a focus on \nequity issues and implications for their professional world and many went on to explore \n 12\nthese issues in their final dissertations. Research topics were wide-ranging and included: \ndisordered eating, the ageing dancer and mismatch in artistic \/ technical maturity, careers \nof dancers, political issues in \u2018democratising dance\u2019, dancers\u2019 self-esteem, and developing \na \u2018dance psychology\u2019. The high quality of work produced is testimony to the potential of \nopening higher education to mature, professional artists. In his final report as external \nexaminer for this programme over a four year period, Christopher Bannerman (2001) \ncommended the extension to knowledge that the student work, particularly the \ndissertations, represented: \n \nI know of no other analysis of dance practice which is of equal breadth and depth, \neither nationally or internationally. This has been made possible by the \ninvolvement of practitioners, who have been empowered by higher education and \nwho have now provided scholars with an unparalleled insight into the world of \ndance. \n \nThis is testimony to the Dearing agenda, perhaps most specifically to insistence that:  \n \nUK higher education must ... sustain a culture which demands disciplined thinking, \nencourages curiosity, challenges existing ideas and generates new ones.  \nBrophy, Craven and Fisher (1998: 25) \n \nOUTCOMES \n \nOutcomes are still unfolding and will continue to do so for many years as the graduate \ndancers move on with their lives. The two main channels through which the value of the \n 13\nprogramme can be evidenced at this point are through benefits and changes in the \nCompany and through benefits and changes in the lives of participating dancers.  \n \na) The Company \n \nThe innovative nature of the degree programme contributed to the Company receiving a \nBreakthrough Award from the Arts Council of England with the Regional Arts Boards in \nDecember 2000. Awards were given for \u2018energy, vision and innovation\u2019 and specifically to \nBirmingham Royal Ballet for:  \n \n\u2026 its pioneering professional development programme for dancers \u2026 The degree \nprogramme the Company has developed in partnership with the University of \nBirmingham, Westhill, provides a model for the sector as a whole. The expertise of \nthe first graduates and students on the degree programme is already feeding into the \nCompany\u2019s work.  \n   (ACE Breakthrough Awards announcement December 15th 2000) \n \nPart of the award was used to fund the setting up of an IT study room which the students \nand other Company members find very useful. The award was also used to fund research \ninto providing other CPD opportunities for Company members, whilst the remainder was \nused to provide professional development placements for MA graduates in the Education \nDepartment.  \n \nFrom the perspective of the current education director, the most important development \nwithin the Company has been a culture shift in terms of the status and value afforded to \neducation work, attributed by her, largely to the degree programme. In 1997, when the first \n 14\ncohort joined the University, freelancers delivered education projects. Most dancers and \nsenior staff were distant from the work in terms of participating, contributing and valuing \nits potential. When a structural reorganisation took place in 2000 and the position of \n\u2018education director\u2019 replaced the former \u2018head of education\u2019 (the title itself indicative of a \nshift in status), shortly before the graduation of the first cohort, the newly appointed \ndirector said: \n \nWhat the degree programme gave me, coming into the Company, was a core of \ndancers who understood what this work was about, who were already beginning to \nask \u2013 why don\u2019t we do this? \u2026 The dancers grabbed the idea and ran with it. \nWithout the degree there would not have been the dancers with the confidence and \ninterest to make it happen, that\u2019s the big difference. As they have begun to deliver \nthe education programme the feedback into the Company, at all levels, and the \nimpact on the dancers doing that work has become really apparent to the ballet \nstaff. So it becomes a cycle and they are valuing it much more \u2026 Now the staff are \nabsolutely convinced of the value and are bending over backwards (with scheduling \netc) to enable the dancers to deliver it. \n \nThe upward spiralling of the work of the education department has been enhanced by the \nraised profile and reputation of the Company in education and community contexts where \nthe more public accessibility of its professional dancers has increased demand for projects \nand links. Not only are the graduate dancers spreading an enthusiasm for education work \nthroughout the Company, they are continuing to develop their skills and expertise within \nthe Education Department team, gaining wider experience and skilling themselves for \nalternative futures post-performing careers. In addition to delivering projects they also \ncontribute ideas to planning and innovation. In 2002 four graduates led a Birmingham \n 15\nRoyal Ballet \/ Gallery 37 Chicago collaborative project called Caf\u00e9 Atlantic, based on \nDavid Bintley\u2019s \u2018Still Life\u2019 At the Penguin Caf\u00e9. This was a Company \/ community \/ \neducation project involving many participants of all ages in a live video-linked \nperformance between the twinned cities of Birmingham and Chicago. The project won a \nCity Lifelong Learning Award for value and originality in artistic \/ technological \nenterprise. These achievements illustrate ways in which the Company is maximising the \nskills of the graduates in new directions:   \n \nGone are the days when organisations thought they could rely on an \u2026 elite to \n\"lead\" whilst others merely \"followed\". They now recognise that they have to make \nthe best possible use of all available talent if they are to compete successfully in \nrapidly changing global markets. Harnessing all available brain power is vital for \neconomic survival and success.  \nCIHE Working Group (1997: 1) \n \nThe Company has extended personal and professional development opportunities for the \ngraduates. One retired from performing and gained a twelve-month placement opportunity \nin the Education Department via the Breakthrough Award. This not only extended her own \nprofessional development, contributing to her securing a prestigious post as Learning \nManager at the Royal Opera House, but also contributed much to the Company during the \nyear. A \u2018pilot post\u2019 has been created for another graduate who wanted to keep performing \nand extend his work in education, particularly in the area of young people with special \nneeds. The management agreed to a shared position that enabled him to block time to gain \nexperience in education and also to continue performing. The complexity of negotiating \nsuch a position around issues such as repertory, fitness levels and rehearsal schedules, \nwould have been \u2018\u2026 unthinkable three years ago \u2026 this is one of the most radical things \n 16\nto happen at BRB\u2019 (director of education). It has enabled him to keep performing and gain \nsome valuable education experience, particularly in project management, at his request.   \n \nb) The Dancers \n \nCharacteristically, adults return to learn with clarity of purpose and high motivation \n\u2026 Their own experience takes them in particular directions and they gain \nconfidence about their own views and values. \n (Carlton and Soulsby (1999:5)  \n \nThe dancers have articulated their own personal growth and empowerment during in-depth \ninterviews:  \n \nI think I have a very much better awareness of what is going on outside of the very \nsmall world of being in a ballet company. (D2)  \n \n... it has been a lot more work than I thought it would be but it has actually woken \nme up rather than made me exhausted. (D9)  \n \nWe've all said ... that it has changed the way we look at dance, the way we look at \nour background, -where we've come from and how it has shaped us, it is everything \n- we've never ever thought about it - it was just 'this is how it is'... like the gender \nissues - how feminists look at ballet ... things that had never occurred to me. (D2)  \n \nLearning through this degree has changed my approach to dancing and it's more \npositive now  ... I am able to work more consistently and calmly ... It has organised \n 17\nthe rest of my life. I think it's confidence and it's also (learning that) it is worth it if \nyou are getting something out of it. At the end of each assignment there was a sense \nof achievement and a sense of where to go to    ...  \nI felt more secure. Dancing isn't everything to me anymore ... if I broke my back \ntomorrow I know there are other things I could do - but before - I didn't know what \nI could do   ... it has changed me. (D9)  \n \nFor some dancers the personal development and self-esteem gained through the course is \nsufficient evidence of its value. One attributed her promotion to Principal dancer to the \nself-confidence gained through the degree programme. She has also presented at an \ninternational symposium on Dance and Medicine in Finland in 2001and published her \nresearch. Two other former Principal dancers and first cohort members have relocated and \nare building strong artist \/ community \/ education links in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  \n \nAt this point it is possible to recognise second career opportunities which have been made \npossible through the degree programme. In addition to the person gaining the position at \nthe Royal Opera House, mentioned above, another graduate was recently offered a dance \npost in a Texas University. Others are being supported in their quests to move into diverse \ndirections within and beyond the Company. The marketing department has agreed to offer \na training placement to a current student, who is about to finish her performing career, \nsubject to her successive completion of the B.Phil programme and the securing of funds. \nAnother, whose career has been stopped through injury, has a place on an intensive \nteacher-training course at the Royal Academy of Dance, a career he would not have \nconsidered if he had not worked with children on this course:  \n \n 18\nI began to understand the power of dance and its impact on people\u2019s lives, \nespecially children\u2019s \u2026 Through this study I am better prepared for the oncoming \nchange in my professional life. I believe it will help me to be a better ballet teacher \nand person\u2026\u201d (D12)  \n \nDancers have so much to offer when their performing lives are over yet many are lost since \nthey fail to recognise the potential they embody. The knowledge, skills and qualities they \ndo possess are well summarised by Deborah Bull (1998: 13): \n  \nDancers know better than anyone else what it feels like to dance, the commitment it \ntakes, how our working lives should be structured, what kind of support we need \u2026 \nWe have unparalleled self-discipline, a terrifying level of dedication and true \ninsight into the work we do and the courage it takes to do it ... \n        \nThe challenge, then, is to find ways to support each retiring dancer in finding the right \n\u2018next step\u2019 in life Entering further and higher education offers one place where there is \ntime for reflection, learning, recognition of personal worth and acquisition of new skills, a \nplace to grow.  \n  \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor a ballet company to open its doors to higher education for dancers is courageous \nbecause education changes people, brings criticism and new vision. Evidence from the first \nfive years suggests that dancers embarking on this opportunity to enter higher education \nwith the University of Birmingham have benefited in many ways and are contributing \nmuch at the interface of artists and education. With the Government identifying the \n 19\nCreative Industries, including the performing arts, as \u201cThe fastest growing sector in the \nUK, generating revenues approaching \u00a360bn and employing more than 1.4 million people\" \n(Luton, 2000), the degree graduates will continue to find ways to use their newly acquired \ncultural capital. Most will be in the position of continuing to invest their lives in the Arts \nworld to maximise the wealth of knowledge and skills accumulated.  \n  \nAs mentioned at the beginning, there is currently a political commitment, in government \nand the Arts Council, to improve Continuing Professional Development (CPD) \nopportunities for artists. Government\u2019s commitment to lifelong learning and widening \nparticipation in further and higher education can provide the door to extending and \ndeveloping more opportunities for experienced professional artists who would like to enter \nhigher education. The Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) and Department \nfor Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) produced the National Advisory Committee on \nCreative and Cultural Education (NACCCE) Report (1999: 61) that mentioned the BRB \nmodel as an exemplar: \n \nNew modes of training should be developed for artists in education which offer \nvenue-based practical training, a mixture of accreditation options and residency \nplanning. Current modes of collaboration between cultural organisations and \nHEI's (Higher Education Institutions) such as the one between the Birmingham \nRoyal Ballet and Westhill ... could be taken forward into the field of continuing \nprofessional development  ... The Birmingham Royal Ballet provides degree-\nlevel studies for dancers in the Company   ... Good practice in this area should \nbe exemplified and built on.  \n         \n 20\nWhilst the rhetorical climate is good for expanding opportunities for dancers and all artists \nin further and higher education, the reality of facing the current financial crisis and under-\nresourcing in the UK\u2019s Universities would suggest caution in optimism. Whilst the \n\u2018Specialist Schools\u2019 movement has increased opportunities for young people to study \ndance in well-resourced secondary (11 \u2013 18 years) \u2018sports\u2019 and \u2018performing arts\u2019 colleges, \ndance in higher education continues to be vulnerable, with recent cuts in courses and \nopportunities across the country. It is important, then, to end on a positive note. The \ninitiative to provide a partnership degree programme between Birmingham Royal Ballet \nand the University of Birmingham has made a positive difference: \n \nTo the Company through: \n\u2022 imaginative continued support for, and use of, graduates; \n\u2022 enhancement of the status of the education department and outreach work. \n \n \nTo the wider education and dance \/ arts world through: \n\u2022 contributing more critical thinkers to the world of professional dance; \n\u2022 stimulating breadth and depth of original research from practitioners; \n\u2022 skilling dancers to be better informed artists in education and community \ncontexts; \n\u2022 pioneering a higher education study model which has been successful. \n \nAnd to the dancers through: \n\u2022 empowering individuals; \n\u2022 broadening and deepening knowledge, skills and understanding; \n 21\n\u2022 enhancing life-chances, including qualifications for better second careers. \n \nJudging narrative discourses in terms of an academic credibility based on positivistic \ncriteria such as reliability and validity is inappropriate in the qualitative domain and is the \nsubject of ongoing debate in social science (Richardson 1993, 2000, Sparkes 1995, 1998, \n2000, 2002, Wolcott 1994). I hope that the reader will judge the integrity of this paper on \nits coherence, authenticity, intrinsic and academic professional interest.   \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nBANNERMAN, C.
