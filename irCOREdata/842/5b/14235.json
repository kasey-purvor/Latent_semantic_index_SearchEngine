Given the constraints of space, we will respond to the main comments in turn.\nWe plan to submit a more considered and elegant paper to a future edition when we have\nworked more on our model.\nAs we are aware, the use of learning technologies is untheoretical, although informed by a\nnumber of theories from a variety of disciplines. Part of our thinking was based on a desire\nto integrate some of these and work towards explanations for what we had seen going on in\nthe courses that we were involved in teaching. That this is recognized in the commentary is\nmuch appreciated.\nOur failure to describe action science in more detail was a product of pressure on space.\nBriefly, action science, was developed as 'the science of interpersonal action' and is\n'centrally concerned with the practice of intervention' (Argyris, Putnam and Smith, 1986:\n35) into frequently mismatched espoused theories and theories in use. The development of\nskill in action science relates to capacity for reflective action; not only reflection on action\nbut also reflection on reflection in action. This is achieved by making theories of action\nexplicit through the presentation and interrogation of case studies.\nThe absence of examples from the data was the product of limitations on space. Other\npapers we have written for conferences make more explicit the relationship between our\nthinking and the data (see for example Davis and Denning, 2000).\n8\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\nThe paper does little justice to the complexities of Bion's thinking about basic assumption\ngroups and work groups, but Table 1 may help. Bion's view was that groups had the\ncapacity to function in any of the three basic assumption groups or to be a work, or\nsophisticated group, but that the two types are mutually exclusive.\nBasic assumption groups\nbased on fantasy\nimpulsive\ndependent on leader\nuncritical\nrapid\ntask-avoiding\nno desire to test consequences\nno patience with enquiry\ngreat insistence on feeling\ndoes not learn from experience\nresists change\ncliche-ridden\nanonymous\nruthless\nahistoric\nvalency\nWork groups\nin touch with reality\ntask-specific\nshared leadership in service of the task\ncritical\nreflective\nhigh level of commitment to the task\nconclusions tested with reality\nquestions how to achieve goal\nseeks for knowledge\nlearns from experience\nseeks change\ndynamic\nownership of responsibility\ncollegiate and interdependent\naware of passage of time\ncooperation of individuals\nTable I: Distinguishing between basic assumption and work groups\nSituated learning was not pursued in anything like the depth it deserved and we are\nworking on another paper that makes more explicit its relationship to computer-mediated\nlearning, particularly in the context of action science. It was included, however, to\ndemonstrate that we were aware of its potential implications for groups working\ncollaboratively through personal case studies. The role of the online tutor here is of\nconsiderable importance and the paper failed to do justice to this and its relationship to the\ndevelopment of expertise.\nOur use of the word 'scaffolding' is firmly based on the work of Vygotsky and we did not\nmean to imply merely the restricted use of students building on one another's comments.\nIndeed, this relates to our thinking about the role of the online tutor that we have explored\nelsewhere (see for example Denning and Davis, 2000).\nThe title of the paper was deliberately playful, indicating the tentative nature of our\nconclusions. For us, at least, and perhaps for other readers, our thinking may inform future\nspeculation about the nature of the online learning environment.\nNeither of the authors is a psychologist but we regard some psychological literature as\nhelpful in exploring the learning environments in which we have worked. We consider\nWilfred Bion's work to be particularly important in thinking about the nature of groups\nand their impact on people's collaborative experiences. His theorizing led to the creation of\nthe Tavistock Institute and to the considerable insights that this organization has given to\nsocial interaction in both the home and the workplace.\n9\nMike Davis and Kate Denning Time to experiment a response\nOur use of the 2x2 matrix has clear limitations and we have struggled to make it work to\nour satisfaction. It did, however, enable us to characterize what we saw as some stereo-\ntypical outcomes of creating learning environments in cyberspace. This represents the\nprovisional nature of our thinking. The suggestion of spider diagrams is extremely helpful\nand we will return to this in our future paper.\nThe value of the model for us is that it helps to shape our, often muddled, reactions to the\nproblem of why some groups were successful and others less so. It is not a definitive\nstatement and some of the comments made by readers have indicated a way forward.\nReferences\nArgyris, C., Putnam, R. and Smith, D.
