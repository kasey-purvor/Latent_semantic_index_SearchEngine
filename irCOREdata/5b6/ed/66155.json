INTRODUCTION\nThe nitric-phosphoric acid \u0001NP\u0002 etch is conventionally\napplied for the surface treatment of the CdTe absorber layer\nof CdTe\/CdS solar cells, before deposition of back-contact\nmetallic layer.1\u20133 This procedure leads to the formation of a\nTe-rich layer which is believed to lower the barrier for carrier\ntransfer from CdTe into the metal and results in the forma-\ntion of a low-resistance contact, and hence also in the de-\ncrease of the cell series resistance as well as improved\nefficiency.4,5 Similar results are obtained using bromine-\nmethanol etching solutions; however, the method, although\neffective in the laboratory conditions, is difficult to apply on\nthe industrial scale due to variations in the reproducibility\nfrom this process and the corrosive nature of the solution.6\nThus NP etch is used in the industrial processes of, for ex-\nample, the ANTEC Solar Energy production line for manu-\nfacturing CdTe\/CdS cells, samples of which are used in the\npresent work.\nIt is important to note that not only positive but also\nnegative effects of nitric-phosphoric etching were reported in\nthe literature. The latter are as follows. \u0001i\u0002 NP etching\nstrongly affects the regions near grain boundaries \u0001GBs\u0002\nwhere the etching rate is significantly larger than that on top\nsurfaces of the intragrain regions.7 \u0001ii\u0002 This creates crevices\nalong the GBs, spreading from the top of the CdTe absorber\nlayer into its depth as the etching time increases.4,5 \u0001iii\u0002 At\nsufficiently long etching times such process leads to the ap-\npearance of electrical shunts in a treated cell. \u0001iv\u0002 The detri-\nmental effect on conversion efficiency of long etching times\nhas been related to these shunts.7\nSo far the studies of NP etching effects were mostly\nfocused on the analysis of microscopic images and\nphotoluminescence,5 remote beam induced current,8 conduc-\ntivity and I-V measurements,9,10 as well as light and dark\nC-V measurements.11 There has not been, however, a com-\nparative study of ac electrical properties of the both etched\nand unetched devices, and neither is there an understanding\nof the possible effects of the NP etch on the defect distribu-\ntion and energy levels. In this work we attempt such a study\napplying an admittance spectroscopy technique to a number\nof devices etched by the NP acidic mix of a standard ratio,\nand using etching time as the only variable parameter. Par-\nticular attention is also given to the measurements on un-\netched samples as this is the part which has not been covered\nin previous studies of admittance on CdTe\/CdS solar\ncells,12\u201314 and as we show, it is especially important for the\ngeneral material characterization. We also perform a com-\nparative study of the effect of etching on the device effi-\nciency versus the effect on the height of back-contact barrier.a\u0002Electronic mail: y.y.proskuryakov@durham.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 101, 014505 \u00012007\u0002\n0021-8979\/2007\/101\u00021\u0001\/014505\/8\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics101, 014505-1\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.65.

SAMPLES AND EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE\nOur studies were performed on samples manufactured\non the ANTEC Solar Energy AG production line, and hence\nhave a particular relevance to mainstream commercial appli-\ncations. The samples comprise of indium tin oxide \u0001ITO\u0002\nlayer on soda-lime glass, followed by 100 nm of CdS, and\n6\u20138 \u0001m of CdTe, where both CdS and CdTe layers were\ndeposited by close space sublimation. The structures were\nthen subjected to a standard CdCl2 activation treatment in\nvapor environment. These manufacturing stages were com-\npleted on the ANTEC Solar production line. The following\nNP etch treatment was done in our laboratory, where varied\nand well controlled etching times were applied for a series of\nsamples. The devices were completed with a 100 nm thick\ngold back contact, deposited either on a NP etched CdTe\nsurface or directly without etching. In this study the com-\nplete and optimized devices have efficiencies of about\n7%\u20138% \u0001It is known15 that an additional activation stage,\nusing wet CdCl2 treatment of these industrial cells in labora-\ntory conditions, can increase the device efficiency up to 11%.\nThis treatment, however, was not applied in this work to\nallow for a direct comparison with industrial processes.\u0002\nThe composition of the used etching solution was 70%\nphosphoric acid, 1% nitric acid, and 29% de-ionized water.\nThe following samples were studied in this work: sample I,\nunetched; sample II, etched for t=10 s; sample III, t=20 s;\nsample IV, t=30 s; sample V, t=40 s; sample VI, t=60 s;\nand sample VII, t=90 s.\nThe admittance measurements were carried out on a So-\nlartron 1260 impedance analyzer equipped with a 1296 di-\nelectric interface. The frequency range used in experiments\nwas from 50 mHz to 1 MHz, and the temperature range was\nfrom 150 to 380 K.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nA. Admittance of unetched devices\nIn Fig. 1 the admittance spectroscopy \u0001AS\u0002 data16 are\nshown for the unetched sample I taken at different tempera-\ntures. The imaginary part of admittance is represented by the\ncapacitance-frequency dependence, while the real part is\nplotted as the conductance divided by the cyclic frequency\nwith a bulk \u0001diode\u0002 contribution subtracted from it. The latter\ncontribution is determined as either dc or low-frequency\nvalue of the total conductance.17 As it is seen in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002,\nthere is a clear structure of three peaks in the conductance\nfrequency dependence at room temperature, indicating the\npresence of at least three defect energy levels in the spec-\ntrum. It is also seen that the positions of these peaks corre-\nspond to the steplike curvatures of C\u0001f\u0002, as expected from\nadmittance spectroscopy theory.16,18\nRecently a revised approach has been suggested to ad-\nmittance characteristics of a p-n junction containing deep\nlevels in the depletion region, which employed a concept of\nsingle defect capacitance and also included a rigorous evalu-\nation of displacement currents in the system.19 In particular,\nthe proposed formulation of that work suggests a simple re-\nlation between normalized conductance and capacitance for\nthe case of weak screening:\nG \u2212 Gd\n\u0002\n= \u2212 \u0003\ndC\nd ln \u0002\n= \u2212 \u0003f dC\ndf , \u00011\u0002\nwhere G is the total ac conductance of the cell, Gd is the dc\nconductance, C is the total capacitance, and \u0002=2\u0003f is the\ncyclic frequency.\nIn Ref. 19 the equation was tested on a CdTe\/CdS cell,\nshowing good agreement with experiment. Importantly, for\nthe cell studied in Ref. 19 no distinct defect levels were\ndetected in the conductance spectrum. We have applied Eq.\n\u00011\u0002 to the C\u0001\u0002\u0002 shown in Fig. 1 and have found a good\nagreement with \u0003G\u0001\u0002\u0002\u2212Gd\u0004 \/\u0002 dependence, though the best\nfit is obtained with a factor of \u0003 \/2 \u0003dashed lines in Figs.\n1\u0001a\u0002\u20131\u0001c\u0002\u0004 instead of \u0003. The latter can be due to the fact that\nthe condition of weak screening as defined by theory is not\nstrictly fulfilled in our unetched samples \u0001further discussion\nof this point is provided below\u0002.\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nAs the temperature is increased, the frequency at which\nthe individual impurity level responds to the applied ac\nmodulation changes as17\n\u0002I = 2\u00040T2 exp\u0005\u2212 Et \u2212 EVkT \u0006 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere Et is the trap energy, EV is the top of the valence band,\nand \u00040 is the temperature-independent emission parameter.\nThis dependence leads to shifting of the conductance peaks\nto higher frequencies with increasing temperature, as can be\nseen in Figs. 1\u0001b\u0002 and 1\u0001c\u0002. Thus, from the analysis of the\npeak positions at different T one can extract the trap energy\nEt corresponding to each of the observed peaks. It has to be\nmentioned here that the formalism discussed above is valid\nonly when the carrier mobility of the sample is high enough\nand the T dependence of the thermal velocity can be given by\nthe free band approximation \u0001Vth=\u0007kT \/2\u0003m*, where m* is\nthe hole effective mass\u0002.18 In practice it is impossible to de-\ntermine the mobility of the carriers in a fully completed solar\ncell, and a separate study of the films of absorber layer ma-\nterial subjected to the same treatment is necessary.20 Previous\nwork on CdTe\/CdS solar cells, however, indicates that the\nabove formalism is well applied to this system,12\u201314,21 and as\nis shown below, it also describes self-consistently the experi-\nmental data obtained in this work, suggesting that the mobil-\nity of the studied samples is reasonably high.\nExperimentally, we have observed five peaks in the con-\nductance frequency dependence of unetched samples, which\nwas measured in the temperature range of 150\u2013380 K. The\nresulting Arrhenius plots for these data are shown in Figs.\n2\u0001a\u0002 and 2\u0001b\u0002. The slope of ln\u0001\u0002 \/T2\u0002 vs 1\/T linear depen-\ndence provides the value of the trap energy Et as follows\nfrom Eq. \u00012\u0002. The energy levels extracted this way are sum-\nmarized in Table I.\nAs it is seen from the table, the comparison of these\nenergy values with those reported for CdTe previously \u0003as\nobtained by both deep-level transient spectroscopy \u0001DLTS\u0002\nand AS\u0004 shows a good agreement. We would like to empha-\nsize that the above results indicate that unetched samples are\nwell characterized by conventional admittance spectroscopy,\nderived theoretically for structures with only one p-n junc-\ntion or Schottky barrier, and despite of the well known fact\nthat unetched devices have a large back-contact barrier, giv-\ning rise to appearance of a Schottky diode near the contact.\nThe latter leads to the presence of two back-to-back diodes in\nthe equivalent circuit of the solar cell, and hence the evalu-\nation of the admittance should be adjusted for such a case.\nEmpirically, however, the methodology derived for admit-\ntance in the one diode case is still valid for the case of un-\netched devices, as evidenced by both \u0001a\u0002 clear Arrhenius\nplots \u0003strictly linear ln\u0001\u0002 \/T2\u0002 vs 1\/T dependence, Fig. 2\u0004 and\n\u0001b\u0002 a good agreement between extracted trap energy values\nwith that known in the literature values. Moreover, the ob-\ntained relation between the derivative of C\u0001\u0002\u0002 and the nor-\nmalized G\u0001\u0002\u0002, Fig. 1, further supports this conclusion.\nOne of the possible explanations as to why there is in the\nadmittance spectra a response from only one barrier related\nto p-n junction, but not from the barrier due to back contact,\ncan be obtained from the observation done in Ref. 30. It was\nnoticed for fully processed CdTe\/CdS devices that the im-\npedance spectra presented on the Nyquist plot show only one\nsemicircle in normal conditions, and can be well described\nby equivalent circuit model suggesting only one diode\/\nbarrier structure. However, at a certain dc bias applied, a\nsecond semicircle on the Nyquist plot started to become vis-\nible in the high-frequency range of the spectra, suggesting\nthe presence of a second barrier due to back contact.30 From\nthis we suppose that the ac response from the back contact\noccurs predominantly in the range of high frequencies, and is\nenhanced by dc bias, while at zero bias and in the lower\nfrequency regime, where the response from defect levels is\nstudied, the ac spectra are relatively undisturbed. A more\ndetailed experimental investigation of this problem is under\nway.\nFIG. 2. \u0003\u0001a\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002\u0004 Arrhenius plot of the normalized conductance peak\npositions for sample I \u0001unetched\u0002.

Effects of varied NP etching\nApplying NP etching for different periods of time before\ndeposition of gold back contacts allows the study of the ef-\nfect of the formation of Te-rich layer at the surface of CdTe\non electric properties as well as cell performance.4,5,7 Our AS\ndata for samples II and III etched for 10 and 20 s, and as\ntaken over the entire temperature range, show structures of\nseveral peaks in normalized conductance, which are similar\nto those in Fig. 1 for the unetched device \u0003typical traces for\nsample II are shown in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0004.\nThe situation becomes significantly different as etching\ntimes of 30 s or more are introduced. For each of these\nsamples only one peak was observed in the studied fre-\nquency range at T\u0005250 K, Figs. 3\u0001b\u0002 and 3\u0001c\u0002, although an\nadditional peak was observed for sample IV \u0001t=30 s\u0002 at low\ntemperatures, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002. Also, for\nsample V an unexpected splitting of the high temperature\npeak \u0003Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002\u0004 was observed at T\u0006200 K \u0001not shown\u0002, and\nat the same time the single conductance peak of sample VI\n\u0003also shown in Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002\u0004 has a position almost independent\nof T in the entire range. For sample VII \u0001not shown\u0002, which\nwas etched for 90 s, no peak structure was observed at all in\nthe entire temperature range. Also, a good fit of the conduc-\ntance data is obtained by Eq. \u00011\u0002 for the 10 s etched sample,\nwith the same coefficient of \u0003 \/2, Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002, as in case of the\nunetched devices. At larger etching times the observed cor-\nrespondence is no longer fulfilled as seen in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002 for t\n=30 s.\nMore information about the effect of etching can be ex-\ntracted from the Arrhenius plots. In Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002 such\nplots are given for samples II \u0001t=10 s\u0002 and III \u0001t=20 s\u0002. It is\nseen that the behavior of the peak positions is well described\nby the theoretical expression, Eq. \u00012\u0002, which is also in agree-\nment with previous studies on fully processed CdTe\/CdS\ndevices.13,21 For these samples we have observed three and\ntwo defect levels, respectively, as seen on the plots \u0003Figs.\n4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004. The levels at energies near 0.51 and 0.43 eV\ncompare well with the ones identified for unetched devices\n\u0001Table I\u0002, while the level at 0.38 eV appears only in these\ntwo etched samples. The latter level was observed previously\nFIG. 3.

In our work, where the 0.38 eV level was observed\nonly in the etched devices, it is clear that some action of the\netching introduces this level. This may be by, for example,\nunintentional impurity doping or by creation of VCd related\ndefects31 during tellurium enrichment of the near-surface re-\ngion.\nFigure 4\u0001c\u0002 shows the Arrhenius plot for sample IV \u0001t\n=30 s\u0002 and for which the behavior of the high T peak posi-\ntion is also well described by Eq. \u00012\u0002. Only one deep level at\n0.507 eV is detected, which is in agreement with previous\nresults on samples I-III, which all show the presence of a\nlevel near 0.51 eV.\nThe inset to Fig. 4\u0001c\u0002 shows a similar plot for the low T\nconductance peak of sample IV, and the observation that the\nparameter \u0002 \/T2 is almost independent of temperature signi-\nfies either a very shallow trap energy of this state or a break-\ndown of the transport characteristics at low T caused by NP\netching process. Further support for the latter can be seen\nfrom Figs. 4\u0001d\u0002 and 4\u0001e\u0002, where, firstly, only a part of the\n\u0002 \/T2 vs T\u22121 can be described by the expected dependence\nwith \u0001Et=0.107 eV\u0002 for sample V, while no part of the data\nagrees with normal behavior at all for sample VI \u0001clearly the\nsame can be said about sample VII as no conductance were\nobserved in AS spectra\u0002. Thus, a clear progressive deteriora-\ntion of the experimental ability to probe defect states by AS\nis seen with an increase of the etching time above 30 s.\nThe deterioration also correlates with the reduction in\nthe number of levels resolved, which starts with five defect\nlevels detected on unetched devices, changing to three levels\non 10 s etched, and to two and one levels on 20 and 30 s\netched samples, respectively. Also, and very importantly, one\ncan notice that mostly shallower trap levels disappear first\nfrom the energy plots, and secondly, at t=30 s only the deep\nlevel at Et=0.51 eV is observed. \u0003We find that the 0.86 eV\nlevel, observed in unetched devices but not seen in AS spec-\ntra of the etched samples, is masked in the latter case by a\nlarge low-frequency tail in G\u0001\u0002\u0002, which develops with in-\ncreasing t; see Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002.\u0004\nQualitatively such behavior can be understood from the\nanalysis of the band diagram of the CdTe\/CdS solar cell and\nits relation to the ac response as measured by admittance\nspectroscopy. In Fig. 4\u0001f\u0002 the position of defect levels in the\nband gap of CdTe absorber layer is shown by dashed lines.\nAs it is seen they cross the Fermi level at various spatial\ndistances from the CdTe\/CdS junction depending on the\nmagnitude of any particular level: deep ones cross closer to\nthe junction, while shallow levels cross further away from\nthe junction and closer to the back contact \u0001right-hand side of\nthe diagram\u0002. The ac response comes only from the states\nclose to the Fermi level, hence the defect levels detected by\nadmittance spectroscopy are well defined in both their ener-\ngetic and spatial positions.\nAs the NP etching is commenced from the surface that\nhas become the back contact, CdTe is dissolved and the layer\nis thinned. Hence the material which contributes to ac re-\nsponse is removed. The deeper the etching, the more of the\nregions where shallower levels are crossing Fermi level will\nbe gone, therefore suppressing their respective contributions\nin the admittance spectra.\nHowever, it has been reported previously that NP etching\nnot only induces formation of the Te-rich layer on the surface\nof CdTe absorber layer and thus thins off this layer but also\ncauses etching and enrichment by Te along the grain bound-\naries, deep into CdTe layer when the etching times are suf-\nficiently long.5,7 It is also important that such \u201cselective\u201d\netching of GBs occurs at much faster rates than that of intra-\ngrain regions. From this one can suggest that the etching\neffect of suppressing the ac response from shallower defects\npoints out that such response comes mostly from grain\nboundaries, and not from the intragrain regions which remain\nrelatively intact after 20\u201330 s long etch. \u0001The latter is easily\nverified by the measurements of the overall thickness of the\nfilm after etching.\u0002 Therefore, this implies, firstly, that the\ncharged defects contributing to the carrier transport are\nmostly located in the GBs and not the interior of the grains,\nand, secondly, that the etching suppresses responses from\nsuch defects.\nOne important point should be made regarding the ob-\nserved effect of disappearance of shallower levels with in-\ncreasing etching time. In principle, one could suggest a link\nbetween this effect and the change in the electric field near\nthe CdTe surface induced by a change in the back-contact\nbarrier height. The back contact is always associated with\ndownward band bending,4 but the magnitude of this is re-\nduced by increased etching time \u0003see later and Fig. 6\u0001b\u0002\u0004.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nband bending shifts both the top of the valence band and trap\nenergy levels in that region, with respect to the Fermi level.\nIn this case, to explain the observed phenomenon, the shal-\nlow trap levels Et should be shifted below the Fermi level\nEF, so that there would be no crossing of Et and EF \u0003Fig.\n4\u0001f\u0002\u0004, and hence no contribution to the ac signal from such\nstates. In reality, however, the effect of etching on the back-\ncontact electric field is opposite: as the etching is increased\nthe barrier for holes is lowered, i.e., its electric field is de-\ncreased, thus leading to shifting upwards of both EV and trap\nlevels Et with respect to the Fermi level in the region close to\nthe back contact.\nTherefore we believe that back-contact effect does not\ninfluence the observed phenomenon and suggest that the\ntransformation of the admittance spectra observed under in-\ncreasing NP etching time is a result of grain boundary modi-\nfications \u0001as grain boundaries are etched out\u0002. One of the\nmost obvious mechanisms of such modification, and as men-\ntioned above, can be a result of Te enrichment at grain\nboundaries, which would effectively cause a drop in GB re-\nsistance \u0001RGB\u0002. Moreover, the capacitive properties of grain\nboundaries are also changed in this case\u2014firstly by addi-\ntional doping \u0001segregation\u0002 inside of them and secondly by\nthe effective \u201cscreening\u201d of electrical field of the depletion\nregion inside of grain boundaries\u2014if the amount of enriched\nTe is large.\nThis interpretation is supported by the low temperature\ndata shown in Fig. 5, where the low frequency \u0001G\u2212Gd\u0002 \/\u0002\nand C measured at T=200 K are plotted for samples I, IV, V,\nand VI. Low temperature is beneficial for the study of both\nscreening and impurity effects, as the contribution from pho-\nnon activation is reduced in the transport phenomena. One\ncan see that there is a dramatic increase in conductance \u0001or\n1\/RGB\u0002 at f\u0006100 Hz as the etching time is increased from\n0 to 60 s. \u0003Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002\u0004. Such enhancement of the low-\nfrequency tail of the conductance indicates a significant in-\ncrease in the concentration of deep-level states \u0001which have\nlow response frequencies\u0002, and this is most likely to be\ncaused by the increased enrichment of Te from the free sur-\nface into the bulk of the CdTe layer as described above. \u0003As\nis seen in the inset to Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002, the maximal difference in\nnormalized conductance between unetched and 40 s etched\nsamples reaches almost three orders of magnitude.\u0004\nOn the other hand, Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002 shows that capacitance of\nthe etched samples is also dramatically affected in the low-\nfrequency range as compared to unetched sample. At f\n\u0006100 Hz the C\u0001f\u0002 dependence first becomes very noisy, and\nat f\u000610 Hz it starts rapidly decreasing, indicating a com-\nplete breakdown in the transport.\nClearly, the low-frequency capacitance behavior corre-\nlates with the observed increase in the conductance at low f ,\nindicating that the suggested mechanism of enhanced GB\nconduction can indeed take place and lead to \u201csquashing\u201d of\nthe depletion region inside of GBs, as well as to shunting of\nthe depletion region capacitance of the CdTe\/CdS junction\nof the cell. The last two effects \u0001from GB capacitance and\ncapacitance of the junction\u0002 should, in principle, contribute\nto the total capacitance simultaneously, which makes dis-\ncrimination between their respective roles difficult in this\nexperiment. This, however, can be a subject of future inves-\ntigation. Two important conclusions can be drawn from the\nabove observations: \u0001i\u0002 that the carrier transport of both\netched and unetched devices is dominated by properties of\ntheir GB regions and \u0001ii\u0002 that excessive NP etching \u0001t\n\u000530 s\u0002 significantly alters the electric properties of the cells\nand can even shunt the cells completely via highly conduc-\ntive GBs at larger etching time.\nC. Cell efficiency versus back-contact barrier height\nIn the context of the above observations for large NP\netching times it is important to assess carefully both positive\nand negative effects of etching at the intermediate periods\n\u0001t\u000630 s\u0002. For this purpose we carried out a comparative\nstudy of conversion efficiency and back-contact barrier\nheight at different etching times t \u0001Fig. 6\u0002.\nThe cell efficiencies were obtained from I-V curves mea-\nsured under 1.5AM illumination from a solar simulator,\nwhile the barrier height at the back contact was determined\nfrom temperature dependence of the series resistance of the\ncell extracted from I-V measurements in the dark at varied\ntemperatures \u0001from 100 to 300 K\u0002. The latter method is de-\nscribed in detail in Ref. 32.\nAs it is seen in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002, the efficiency \u0007 of unetched\nsamples is relatively high in most cases with respect to the\nmaximal value of about 7%. At the same time these values\nare quite narrowly distributed \u0001around 6% in this case\u0002.\nHowever, at some instances \u0001approximately three times out\nof ten\u0002 the efficiency can be quite low as indicated by two\nencircled points on this plot. We believe that such low values\nare associated with the cleanness \u0001or lack of such\u0002 of the\nFIG. 6. Dependence on the NP etching time of \u0001a\u0002 light conversion effi-\nciency and \u0001b\u0002 back-contact barrier height. NP etching reduces the large\nscatter of efficiencies seen for unetched cells and eliminates low performing\ncontacts \u0001circled points\u0002.\n014505-6 Proskuryakov et al. J. Appl.

This is confirmed by\nthe fact that as soon as NP etching is introduced the large\nrange of such scatter \u0001from 0.5% to 6%\u0002 disappears alto-\ngether. \u0001We note, however, that high efficiency values of\nabout 10%\u201311% have been obtained previously without wet\netching prior to back-contact deposition.12\u0002 The efficiency\nrises with increasing etching time, reaching maximum at t\n\b20 s, after which it gradually decreases \u0001t\u000590 s\u0002. The op-\ntimal value of the NP etching time is known to vary from one\nlaboratory to another, typically between 20 and 60 s. In our\nexperience such variation is strongly dependent on how long\nthe samples were kept in open air after their manufacture and\nbefore back contacting, i.e., on the thickness of the oxide\nlayer formed on the surface. For this work the samples were\nkept in vacuum immediately after receiving them from the\nmanufacturer, hence lower optimal etching time t. It is also\nimportant to mention that out of all the parameters defining\nthe quality of I-V curves of the etched samples, i.e., the\nconversion efficiency of the cells, it is the short circuit cur-\nrent \u0001Jsc\u0002 which is affected the most by variation of t. For\nexample, Jsc decreases by a factor of 2 or more from its\nmaximal value within the period of t\t100 s, while the fill-\ning factor \u0001FF\u0002 decreases only by about 20% and the open\ncircuit voltage \u0001Voc\u0002 remains practically unchanged. For the\ncase of the etching time t=0, the main difference between\nwell performing cells \u0001with \u0007\n6%\u0002 and those with poor\nquality \u0003as the ones encircled in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002\u0004 is mostly the dif-\nference in Voc and FF which determines the drop in effi-\nciency. According to our observations the latter takes place\nbecause of the well known \u201croll-over\u201d effect in I-V charac-\nteristics, which is attributed to poor quality of back contact.\nThe dependence of the back-contact barrier height on t is\nshown in Fig. 6\u0001b\u0002. The magnitude of the barrier drops from\n0.56 eV for unetched sample to approximately 0.47 eV in\nthe first 10 s of etching, after which it remains constant\nwithin the experimental error. It is important to point out that\nfor the plot in Fig. 6\u0001b\u0002 we have chosen the unetched device\nof the poorest quality from the set described above \u0001with the\nlight conversion efficiency of only 0.5%\u0002 which, as one\nwould expect, should have the largest value of the back-\ncontact barrier, which is indeed the case as direct measure-\nments show. Nonetheless, one can see from the plot that even\nin this worst case scenario the overall change in the barrier\nheight is only of about 20% \u0001from 0.56 to 0.47 eV\u0002. This\npoints out that although NP etching improves the cell perfor-\nmance of the cells, it does not eliminate completely the back-\ncontact barrier.\nAnother important conclusion which can be drawn from\nFig. 6 is that there is a significant difference between optimal\netching time for maximal efficiency t=20 s and the time\nwhen the back-contact barrier reaches its saturated value t\n=10 s. This implies that continual improvement in efficiency\nafter the first 10 s of etching is not related to the magnitude\nof the barrier, and hence formation of the Te-rich layer on\nCdTe surface, but rather has a different origin. We believe\nthat it is most likely caused by the relatively fast etching\nalong the grain boundaries and by the enrichment of this GB\nregions with Te, for these are the strongest modifications in\nelectrical and structural properties of the etched cells, as it\nwas discussed in the previous section \u0003see Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and\n4\u0001b\u0002\u0004. This implies, however, that Te enrichment of GBs is\nnot entirely a negative effect \u0001as in creating electrical\nshunts\u0002, but, in fact, it has a positive characteristic if the\netching times are not larger than a certain value. The nature\nof such positive characteristic could be the substantial in-\ncrease in the \u201ceffective\u201d back-contact area, with highly con-\nductive \u0001Te-filled\u0002 regions of GBs acting as extra collectors\nof the photogenerated and diffused carriers.\nIV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nFrom our results on unetched devices we can conclude,\nfirstly, that unetched devices can be well characterized by\nconventional AS, and the interference from the back-contact\nSchottky barrier can be neglected at least on an empirical\nlevel. \u0001It is important to stress, though, that this result was\nobtained on samples which were stored in vacuum prior to\nback-contact deposition, thus avoiding the formation of a\nthick oxide layer on the surface of CdTe.\u0002 Secondly, the ad-\nmittance spectra of unetched devices reveal much richer\nstructure than that of etched samples, with as many as five\ndefect levels detected. It should be pointed out that previ-\nously the maximal number of energy trap levels extracted\nfrom AS data for a single CdTe\/CdS device, as reported in\nliterature, was not more than 2. \u0001This being for fully pro-\ncessed devices, implying NP or Br\u2013MeOH etching before\nback contacting.\u0002 This suggests that it can be advantageous\nto characterize unetched devices as opposed to the etched\nones, if the purpose of the study is the characteristics of the\nconstituent materials \u0001CdTe absorber layer, etc.\u0002 Also, in this\ncase one would eliminate the additional source of traps from\nwet etching \u0003as it was shown in Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002 the ad-\nditional level at 0.38 eV was detected in etched samples\u0004.\nWe have also shown that the capacitance data and fre-\nquency dependence of conductance of the unetched sample\n\u0001Fig. 1\u0002 obey the theoretically predicted proportionality \u0003Eq.\n\u00011\u0002\u0004 and directly correlates with the results on the etched\nsamples \u0003Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0004, which additionally verifies the conclu-\nsion about applicability of the known formulation for AS to\nunetched devices. It is interesting that in both etched and\nunetched devices the coefficient of proportionality in Eq. \u00011\u0002\nturns out to be \u0003 \/2 instead of the theoretical value of \u0003. In\nthe revisited admittance spectroscopy theory19 which in-\ncludes the evaluation of displacement current, Eq. \u00011\u0002 was\nobtained for the case of weak screening. The verification\ncriterion for such a regime is by the small variation of ca-\npacitance over the entire frequency range, which, however, is\nnot fulfilled for the samples studied here where C varies by a\nfactor of 3 or more. On the other hand, it was pointed out19\nthat the validity of Eq. \u00011\u0002 should also hold beyond the weak\nscreening case, hence the observed correspondence with a\nsmaller prefactor in this work might be expected.\nThe progressive effect of NP etching with time as mea-\nsured by AS can be summarized as follows: \u00011\u0002 shallower\ntrap levels disappear first from the AS energy plots, \u00012\u0002 at t\n=30 s only the deep level at Et=0.51 eV remains resolved,\n\u00013\u0002 this can reflect the disruption of ac response due to spa-\ntially deeper etching, with the predominant effect being on\n014505-7 Proskuryakov et al.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\ngrain boundaries, \u00014\u0002 in the context of \u00013\u0002, the disruption of\nac response indicates that trap\/defect levels detected by AS\nare mostly concentrated near GBs, and \u00015\u0002 that etching off of\nthis region leads to Te enrichment as well as quenching of\nthe electric field inside of GBs. The latter effect is also found\nto be beneficial in terms of enhanced current collection and\nthus improved conversion efficiency for etching times up to\n20 s.\nFrom these observations it is also possible to suggest\nthat the positive effect observed by Te enrichment of GBs\ncan be utilized and improved using the introduction of other\nmaterials for intentional doping. Perhaps considerable im-\nprovement obtained in conversion efficiency of samples with\nback-contact containing copper bears direct relevance to\nthis,33 as Cu atoms are known to diffuse easily through CdTe\nlayer, and hence in principle they can accumulate at GBs.\n\u0001The evidence for that mechanism has been reported\nrecently.34\u0002 The improved control of such diffusion of Cu or\nother metal can potentially be utilized in rigorous grain\nboundary engineering, and perhaps even assist in overcom-\ning the time instability known for CdTe\/CdS solar cells con-\ntaining Cu.\n1H.
