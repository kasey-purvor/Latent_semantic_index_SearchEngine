Through a series of structured workshop sessions they collaborate to \nenvisage future activities related to technology design, build models of the contexts of use for \nfuture technologies, act out scenarios of use for their models, re-conceive their scenarios in \nrelation to present-day technologies, list problems with implementing the scenarios, explore \nthe gap between current and future technology and activity, and end by listing requirements \nfor future technology. The method has been used successfully with children and adults to \nexplore new technology-activity systems including interacting with digital photographs and \ninformal science learning. \n \nIntroduction \nSince the early 1980s (Sharples, 1987), through a series of major projects with industry and \nacademic partners, we have developed and refined a method, named socio-cognitive \nengineering, for human-centred design of socio-technical systems (Sharples, Jeffery, du \nBoulay, Teather, Teather, & du Boulay, 2002; Sharples, 2006).  Like participatory design and \nrelated approaches, socio-cognitive engineering draws on the knowledge of potential users \nand involves them in the design process. It extends beyond individual users to analyze the \nactivity systems of people and their collaborative interaction with technology, including their \nsocial interactions, styles and strategies of working, language and patterns of communication, \nto produce a composite picture of human knowledge and collaborative activity that informs \nsystems design and implementation. The socio-cognitive engineering framework consists of \ntwo main parts: a phase of activity analysis to interpret how people work and interact with \ntheir current tools and technologies, and a phase of systems development to design, build and \nimplement new interactive technology. Through this structured process of analysis and \ndevelopment, based on the relation between a Task Model that synthesizes the activity \nanalysis, and a Design Concept that guides software engineering, socio-cognitive engineering \nhas provided a shared method for multi-disciplinary teams to develop large systems for \nknowledge work and collaborative learning such as the MOBIlearn European mobile learning \nplatform (Bo, 2005). \n \nFrom the experience of projects such as MOBIlearn and MEDIATE (Sharples et al., 2002) we \nalso discovered limitations of the approach. One significant problem is that design methods \ngrounded in an analysis of everyday activity are not appropriate for developing radically new \nor disruptive devices that overturn current technologies (Bower & Christensen, 1995). Nor are \nthey suited to envisioning how people might learn, work or play together in a future of \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 2 \npervasive computing. It would be tempting simply to bolt a \u2018future gazing\u2019 method, such as a \nDelphi survey (Delbecq, Ven, & Gustafson, 1975) or scenario planning (Schwartz, 1997), \nonto the front of socio-cognitive engineering, but these are designed to support group decision \nmaking or assist strategy planning, not to inform systems design. Thus, we identified a need \nfor a method that can directly inform a process of human-centred systems design. To fit into \nthat process it needs to meet the following criteria: \n \na) Minimal participant training. It can be used with adults or children with no prior \ntraining in software design to enact and analyse collaborative interaction with \ntechnologies that have not yet been envisaged. \nb) Collaborative. It can involve group activities to role play the interactions between \npeople and future collaborative technology, to support the design of CSCW and CSCL \nsystems. \nc) Direct input to design. It forms part of a human-centred approach to software \nengineering, producing general requirements that can guide programmers and technology \ndesigners. \nd) Cost-effective to run. It can be carried out in any large room, with cheap and portable \nequipment, in a day workshop. \ne) Relates people and technology. It explores the relations between future activity and \nfuture technology, providing requirements for socio-technical systems, not just new \npieces of hardware. \nf) Open-ended. It does not constrain the form and scope of the new socio-technical system \nby requiring (or excluding) certain patterns of behaviour or certain use contexts. \ng) Pragmatic. It identifies those activities that meet a human need and also could \nconceivably be designed by practical present-day engineering methods. \n \nThe following section surveys current methods for participatory design and assesses them \nagainst these criteria. \n \nExisting methods \nMany participatory design methods have been developed to involve users in the technology \ndesign lifecycle, including informant design (Scaife & Rogers, 1999), contextual inquiry \n(Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), technology immersion (Druin, Bederson, Boltman, Miura, \nKnotts-Callahan, & Platt, 1999), and low-tech prototyping (Ehn & Kyng, 1991). Muller and \nKuhn (1993) classified Participatory Design techniques according to when in the design \nprocess the technique is applied (early, as in Future Workshops, or late, as in participatory \nanalysis of usability data) and whether the technique involves designers participating in the \nusers\u2019 world (e.g., ethnography), or users participating in the designers\u2019 world (e.g., PICTIVE \n\u2013 Muller, 1991).  \n \nThis paper covers only those methods that are intended for the exploratory parts of design, to \nenvisage future technologies or technology-enabled societies, such as Future Workshops \n(Kensing & Halskov-Madsen, 1991) and Strategic Visioning Workshops (Sanders, 2000). \nSimilar techniques that are intended to provoke innovation in the design of products and \nservices have been developed outside Participatory Design, such as the Lead User method \n(von Hippel, 1986), adapted focus groups, reported in Industrial Design projects (Bruseberg \n& McDonagh-Philp, 2001), and the Focus Troupe (Salvador & Sato, 1998). The following \nsubsections analyse methods within and around Participatory Design, with reference to the \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n3  \ncriteria listed in the Introduction. The discussion focuses only on those methods that are \nspecifically intended to envisage future technologies and interactions that reach beyond \ntraditional settings (such as the workplace or the classroom) and into everyday life more \ngenerally, thus leaving out some of the classic Participatory Design methods that are \nconcerned with the analysis of traditional work and learning settings (see for example Scaife \n& Rogers, 1999; Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998; Druin et al., 1999; Muller, 1991).  \n \nFocus groups to bridge Ergonomics and Industrial Design \n \nBruseberg and McDonagh-Philp (2001) document approaches from Industrial Design for \napplying focus group techniques to elicit user needs, aspirations and emotions for the \ndevelopment of successful new products. Applied in the context of small domestic kitchen \nappliances, the approach interprets the term \u2018focus group\u2019 broadly and uses it as a generic \nterm \u201cin favour of other terms such as workshop or participatory discussion\u201d (Bruseberg and \nMcDonagh-Philp op. cit., p. 439). It explores the combination of focus groups with other \ntechniques such as presentations, mood boards, product personality profiling, and sketching.  \n \nThe approach appears to be cost-effective and pragmatic. The outcomes of the focus group \nwere analysed in two stages. First, the design researcher produced tables summarising \nconcepts and their frequency of mention in the focus groups as well as rankings of purchase \npriorities, lists of ideas and comments. Then, further brainstorming among the design team \n\u201cprovided further insight into the results, clarified questions and specified product \nrequirements\u201d (Bruseberg & McDonagh-Philp, op. cit., p. 448). Thus, although the method \nclearly provides input for the design process, this input comes from the designers\u2019 \ninterpretations of the focus group sessions, not directly from the participants. The main \nlimitation is that participants in focus groups talk about the design of new technology, rather \nthan engaging in the design as participants in the process of modelling artefacts and role \nplaying the activities involved in interacting with them.  \n \nFuture Workshops and other Co-operative Design Workshop formats \n \nJungk and M\u00fcllert (1987) developed Future Workshops as a technique to enable citizen \ngroups with limited resources to have a say in the decision making processes of public \nplanning authorities. Kensing (1987) proposed its use in system development, as a means to \nenvision how IT can support future work situations. A Future Workshop includes three \nphases: the Critique phase (a structured brainstorming session that focuses on existing \nproblems related to the design task), the Fantasy phase (the participants envision a future free \nof the previously identified problems), and an Implementation phase (a group discussion on \nthe feasibility of the vision that resulted in the Fantasy phase and the development of an \naction plan for the implementation of the vision). Kensing and Halskov Mansen (1991) \nfurther suggested the integration of Future Workshops with metaphorical design, where \nmetaphors are introduced at critical points by the facilitators to broaden the perspectives of \nthe participants. \n \nArvidsson, Ihlstr\u00f6m, and Lundberg (2002) suggest complementing the Fantasy phase of the \nFuture Workshop with a Trigger phase, where possible technological solutions are \ndemonstrated to aid the participants to imagine what might be possible. Ihlstr\u00f6m, Svensson, \nand \u00c5kesson (2005) have used a combination of an adaptation of Future Workshops with \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 4 \nscenario building, mock-up construction and focus groups for the design of future everyday \nIT artefacts (namely, the e-Newspaper of the future).  \n \nSvanaes and Seland (2004) present another structure for cooperative design workshops for \ndesign projects involving mobility and computer-mediated communication. Their proposed \nworkshop structure starts with a drama and scenario building session, where participants \nengage in scenario creation and role-play after being introduced to drama techniques and \npresented with the goals of the workshop (optionally with the aid of presentations of data \nfrom the field). This is followed by mock-up design, using Post-it\u00ae notes and foam models. \n \nThese workshop formats appear to meet the criteria for minimal participant training (with the \nexception perhaps of the drama workshops, which require training participants in drama \ntechniques), collaborative group activities, cost-effectiveness (again, with the exception of \ndrama workshops which require a professional drama facilitator), pragmatism and focus on \npeople as well as technology. However, they do not meet the criteria for open-endedness and \ndirect input to design.   \n \nIn particular, they seem to start with the presentation of solution ideas (e.g., e-Ink \ntechnology), technology triggers (e.g., video clips of future use and pictures of prototypes), \ndata from the field, or identified problems in participants\u2019 own current practices. Priming the \nparticipants so early in the workshop with data from existing practices and issues may have a \nnegative impact on the advance of the workshop: \u201chow the idea of the artefact is presented \nand which triggers and materials for mock-ups are chosen, all influence participant input very \nmuch. Therefore, it is very important that these decisions are carefully considered\u201d (Ihlstr\u00f6m \net al. 2005, p. 18). Grounding the workshop from the onset in experiences and problems of the \npresent day and priming the participants with suggestions for new technology may restrict the \nideas and requirements to the technological limitations of the present, which may soon \nbecome obsolete anyway. Considering possible technological solutions before exploring what \nthe problem might be like in the future (i.e., by looking at technology first and then thinking \nabout activity around that technology), can constrain creativity and breakthrough thinking. As \nInkpen (1999) reports from experiences of designing future handheld technologies for \nchildren: \u201cwhile this activity was successful in identifying important issues for the design of \nhandheld computers, many of the children were constrained by their preconceived notions \nabout what constitutes a computer and the functionality it can provide\u201d. (Inkpen op. cit., p. \n86). \n \nFurthermore, none of the abovementioned workshop structures elicits requirements from the \nparticipants directly: it is up to the design team to interpret the process and outcomes of the \nworkshop in order to draw out user requirements rather than to obtain requirements that are \npromptly available along with the rationale behind them. \n \nGenerative Tools and Strategic Visioning Workshops \n \nSanders (2000) describes the use of tools to give people the opportunity to express their \ndreams of an ideal, future world visually and verbally in a way that can inform and inspire the \ndesign development process. What he calls \u2018generative tools\u2019 includes tools designed to elicit \nemotional responses and expressions from people, as well as tools to uncover meaning and \ncognitive understanding. These are contained in a \u2018toolkit\u2019, which \u201cusually contains a \nbackground on which to work, together with a large number of simple and ambiguous \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n5  \ncomponents that can be arranged and juxtaposed in a variety of ways\u201d (Sanders op. cit., p. 7). \nThe visual components include photographs, sketches, coloured paper cut into shapes, and \nthree-dimensional forms covered with Velcro material. These can be annotated with pens, \ncrayons or markers. \n \nStrategic Visioning Workshops  employ the toolkits to facilitate effective collaboration: \u201cthe \ntransformation that takes place when a group of people goes from a verbal exchange of ideas \nto a collective and visually expressive mode is remarkable. It is invariably positive and can \noften be quite therapeutic for the participants.\u201d (Sanders op. cit., p. 11).  \n \nThe generative tools appear to be simple, low-cost and easy to use, and participants need \nminimal instructions to start working with the tools. In the Strategic Visioning Workshop \nformat, they also facilitate collaboration effectively. The focus of the process is on people, \ntheir dreams and aspirations, and technology does not get in the way. Participants are free to \nuse the tools as they wish and produce anything they like. However, Strategic Visioning \nWorkshops as described in Sanders (op cit.) do not meet the criteria for providing direct input \nto design: the outcomes of using the generative tools are visual displays such as collages, \nwhich may be a rich source of data for a design team, but do not provide an explicit set of \nrequirements. Moreover, the workshops are not necessarily pragmatic: participants are free to \nexpress their \u2018dreams\u2019 and no attempt is made to ground those dreams in today\u2019s world. \n \nRole playing games and SPES (Situated and Participative Enactment of Scenarios) \n \nIacucci, Kuutti, and  Ranta  (2000) suggest the use of role-playing games and situated and \nparticipative enactment of scenarios (SPES) as methods that overcome three design \nchallenges: open-ended design, designing for mobility, and designing beyond the workplace. \nRole-playing games require that designers set up games to simulate contexts and events while \nparticipants role-play within the context of the game to envision services and technologies \nappropriate for the situations formed. SPES involves the designer \u2018shadowing\u2019 a user for one \nto two days, with the user carrying a mock-up device which they use to enact scenarios \ncreated on the fly, based on real-life situations that either the designer or the user considers \ninteresting.  \n \nBoth techniques are low cost, pragmatic, and do not appear to require any participant training. \nRole-playing games are collaborative, whereas SPES involves a single user at a time. The \nmain outcome of both techniques is scenarios that showcase uses of new products and \nservices. These scenarios need to be further analysed by the design team to deduce \nrequirements. Moreover, although the techniques are meant to support open-ended design, the \ndegree of openness allowed is limited: the role-playing games are \u201cflexible enough to allow a \nco-development of services and devices\u201d (Iacucci, Kuutti, &  Ranta , op.cit., p.199), however \nthese are based around familiar use contexts and activities; SPES results in realistic scenarios \nextracted from the participant\u2019s everyday practice, but again offers no flexibility to envision \nchanges in everyday practice. Therefore, although the two techniques are independent of \nspecific work tasks, they are still based on current activities and practices. \n \nThe Lead User method and Lead Users Workshop \n \nVon Hippel (1986) suggested the involvement of \u2018Lead Users\u2019 in the development of new \nproduct concepts. Lead users are those users of existing products who currently face needs \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 6 \nthat will eventually become general in the marketplace and also expect to benefit significantly \nfrom a solution to those needs. Meeting these two criteria makes Lead Users good candidates \nfor drawing the attention of designers and developers to potentially important needs that \nexisting solutions do not satisfy, and for suggesting preliminary solutions by reflecting on \nhow they presently overcome these problems. Herstatt and von Hippel (1992) conducted a \nnew product design workshop with Lead Users in the context of manufacturing pipe hangers. \nThe workshop took place over three days, and included the Lead Users identifying trends and \nproblems, specifying problem areas, and finding solutions to these problems as suggested \ndesigns. Herstatt and von Hippel (op. cit.) report that the outcomes of the Lead User \nWorkshop were designs which were valued by the manufacturer and led to successful \nproducts. The whole process, from specification of Lead User criteria to design \nrecommendations, took nine months to complete. Although the participants do not need \nspecial training to participate, the process of identifying Lead Users involves several steps \nand is not straightforward. The participants work together in small groups on the solutions \nthey come up with, with each participant required to rotate through all sub-groups to avoid \nbias. The outcome of the workshop is directly usable in design and pragmatic, as it is in \nessence a first specification of an immediately implementable solution that stems from the \nexperiences and practical problems faced by the participants. However, the whole workshop \nis highly focused on a specific piece of technology. Although it is successful in the design of \nnew replacement products, it may not be suitable for the design of radically new or disruptive \nsocio-technical systems, for which Lead Users do not yet exist. \n \nTable #1 compares the methods and techniques discussed above against the criteria we set out \nin the Introduction. As it shows, none of the reviewed techniques satisfies all the criteria. Two \nmethods (Future Workshops and Strategic Visioning Workshops) satisfy five of the seven \ncriteria, but neither were developed to provide direct input to a process of human-centred \nsystems design. \n \nTable #1.

This need arose \nin two projects \u2013 Children as Photographers (www.cap.ac.uk) and MOBIlearn \n(www.mobilearn.org) \u2013 where the objectives were to explore how people in the future may \ninteract with personal technologies and to inform the design of new technologies and their \nuses. For the Children as Photographers project, the aim was to understand how children \nmight capture and share images in the future (the first session was held in 2001 when digital \ncameras were first becoming available to the mass market, and camera phones had not been \nintroduced in Europe). For MOBIlearn, the aim was to develop and explore scenarios of use \nfor a large European mobile CSCL project. \n \nIn the FTW method, participants who are familiar with the domain of interest (but are not \ngenerally technology experts) are guided through a process of exploring and designing the \ninteractions between current and future technology, and current and future activities. These \ninteractions form a grid, as shown in Table #2. The FTW sessions address four questions: \nHow are current activities performed with the support of current technologies (Box 1 in Table \n#2)? How might these same activities be performed with new technologies in the future (Box \n2 in Table #2)? What new activities might current technologies support (Box 3 in Table #2)? \nWhat new activities could be enabled by future technologies (Box 4 in Table #2)?  \n \nEach of these interactions is valuable to systems designers. Box 1 in Table #2 explores how \npeople currently engage with technology (the starting point for the socio-cognitive \nengineering process and many other Participatory Design methods). Box 2 in Table #2 \nextrapolates these activities to new technology, to understand whether the envisaged \ntechnology is familiar or disruptive. Box 3 in Table #2 encourages the participants to explore \nnew ways to engage with current technology. Box 4 in Table #2 offers an opportunity for \n\u2018imagineering\u20191. The aim of a Future Technology Workshop is to reach an informed \nunderstanding of how people might interact with technology in the future (box 4 in Table #2) \nby exploring the possibilities represented by all four boxes.  \n \nTable #2. Interactions between activities and technology, now and in the future. \n \n CURRENT TECHNOLOGY FUTURE TECHNOLOGY \nCURRENT ACTIVITY 1. Everyday technology-mediated \nactivity \n2. Familiar activities supported by \nnew technology \nFUTURE ACTIVITY 3. New activities that current \ntechnology might support \n4. New activities with new \ntechnologies \n \n \nThis is achieved through a series of seven sessions, with a minimum of six and maximum 20 \nparticipants2, plus two or three facilitators. The sessions are called: 1) Imagineering, 2) \nModelling, 3) Role-play, 4) Retrofit, 5) Everyday, 6) Futurefit, and 7) Requirements. Each \nsession has a defined outcome, which is recorded by the facilitators who manage the session. \nThe workshop is typically carried out as a half-day event, with approximately two hours \ndedicated to the first four sessions, a one-hour break, and approximately 90 minutes for the \nremaining three sessions. An FTW toolkit is available for download, detailing the structure of \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 8 \nthe workshop, the materials necessary for each session, and instructions for carrying out each \nsession (www.ftw.org.uk). \n \nThe workshop structure was finalised through a series of pilot studies held during 2001-2 \n(Vavoula, Sharples, & Rudman, 2002). An important issue has been in which of the four \nboxes in Table #2 to start the process, and where in the future (far or near) to focus. If it starts \nwith current technology or activity, or the focus remains on the near future throughout, then \nthe process risks just extrapolating from the present and missing the opportunities for \ndesigning radically new and disruptive technology \u2013 and activity. If it starts in the future, or \nthe focus remains on the far future, it could result in fanciful activities and unworkable \ntechnology.  \n \nThe initial research took place at a children\u2019s holiday camp in February 2001. At that point, \nonly the imagineering and modelling sessions were carried out. Six boys and six girls, aged \n11 years, participated. Although they generated ideas for new technologies, they did not \npropose how these might enable new everyday activities. The combination of technology and \nactivity appeared to be necessary in order to refine the design ideas and to provide the \nchildren with the context necessary for identifying further technological requirements. As a \nresult, the method was extended with additional sessions to role play with the models and to \nrelate the models to existing technology.  \n \nA second pilot was carried out with six adults, comprising three engineers and three non-\nengineers, all students or staff of the University of Birmingham. Their design task related to \nways of \u201ccapturing and sharing visual events and experiences in the future\u201d. Among the list of \nideas they produced, was immersing people into the sights, sounds and feelings of another \nplace and\/or time. The additional workshop tasks did indeed help the participants to put the \nimaginary technologies in context. For example, a pair that had designed a robot to \u2018capture \ndistant experiences\u2019 acted out how it might visit the owner\u2019s home town, interact with their \nfriends and family, and transmit the experience back to the owner. \n \nThe pilot study raised a problem with the initial brainstorming session. Initially, the \nparticipants generated somewhat mundane suggestions that extended existing technology (\u2018A \nrecord\/diary of one\u2019s life in images\u2019; \u2018A permanent record of everything one sees over a \nlifetime, that they can review at the end\u2019). Only when the participants were asked to \u201cthink \n\u2018space age\u2019\u201d did the suggestions become more radical, for example: \u2018intelligent mechanism \nthat records everything but recalls only what is important\u2019 and \u2018teleporting into a \n\u201cphotographic\u201d reality, which also provides stimuli for other senses\u2019.  \n \nA third pilot was designed to build on the outcomes of the second. The design task related to \nways of \u201cimmersing into the sights and sounds of another place and\/or time\u201d. It was carried \nout with seven adults, three engineers and four non-engineers, and all the sessions were \ncompleted. Several ideas for \u201cimmersive\u201d activities were produced during imagineering. The \nthird pilot resulted in alternative designs and ideas, but these were no more detailed than those \nproduced in the second pilot. Furthermore, the second and third pilots produced a list of very \ngeneral, non-functional requirements rather than more detailed, functional requirements that \nwould be needed for further development of the ideas. Modifications to the FTW method \nwere made so that the participants would be asked to list requirements specifically related to \nthe models they produce, and also so that a follow-up workshop would build on a specific \nmodel from the first workshop rather than on abstract models. \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n9  \n \nAs a result of the pilot studies, we found that the most successful approach is to start with \ntechnology and activity in the far future (Box 4 in Table #2).  This frees the participants from \nthe limitations of the present and engages them in an enjoyable future-gazing session. Then \nthey follow a series of sessions to ground their ideas by exploring how they relate to current \nactivity and technology and projecting these into the near future where new but achievable \ntechnologies emerge. Bruseberg and McDonagh-Philp (2001) describe the aim of new designs \nas being \u201cto come reasonably close to the ideal, whilst not leaving the perception of the \nstereotype (standard) too far behind\u201d (p 438). The FTW process facilitates the \nconceptualisation of the ideal followed by its re-conceptualisation through critical analysis of \nthe stereotype, to arrive at new designs. \n \nThe method starts by presenting the participants with a topic to be explored, either because it \npresents opportunities for new interaction with technology (e.g., \u2018how would people capture, \nuse and share images in the future?\u2019) or is an area of research interest (e.g., \u2018informal science \nlearning\u2019). Starting with Box 4 in Table #2, it circles through 3, 1 and 2 and back to 4, \ntravelling at the same time from the far future, to the present and recent past, and then to the \nnear future. More specifically, the process starts in Box 4 in Table #2, examining new activity \nand technology in the far future. The same activity of the far future is then brought into the \npresent in Box 3 in Table #2, to examine its feasibility with current technology. Current \nactivities are then explored in Box 1 in Table #2, with reference to recent past experiences, to \nidentify limitations and problems in activities and technologies of the present day. The visions \nof Box 4 in Table #2 as well as the realities and constraints of Boxes 3 and 1 are then merged \ninto Box 2 in the near future, to examine whether and how emerging technology can support \ncurrent activity. Finally, Box 4 in Table #2 is revisited but this time it is placed in the near \nrather than the far future, ultimately to identify requirements for emerging technology to \nsupport emerging activities. Figure #1 shows the sequence and placement in time of the \ndifferent sessions of the FTW as they correspond to the four boxes in Table #2. In the \nfollowing sections we shall describe each session in detail. \n \n \n \nFigure #1.

A \nside effect of this session is also that the participants\u2019 outlook is now set to think of the future. \nTable 2 grid box: 4 \u2013 Future activity \nPlacement in time: Far future \n \nDuring the Imagineering session, the whole group of participants takes part in a brainstorming \nexercise to envisage future activities in relation to the design task at hand. Brainstorming is a \nmethod for creative idea generation from a group of people (Osborne 1963), that comprises a \nfacilitator and the idea-generating participants. The basic rules for successful brainstorming \ninclude the following: (a) avoid judgement during the idea generation, (b) quantity breeds \nquality, (c) verbalise ideas as soon and as often as they occur, and (d) combine ideas and build \non each other\u2019s ideas (Jonassen, Tessmer, & Hannum, 1999, p. 264). The generated ideas are \nnoted by the facilitator and put on public display, e.g., on a flip chart. The facilitator may \ncluster the ideas as they are produced with the aid of the participants. Often clustering comes \nnaturally, as participants pick up each other\u2019s ideas and make related suggestions. This allows \nthe main themes to be identified by the end of the session (Maguire 2001). \n \nThe Imagineering session starts with the facilitator priming the group with a question that \nconcerns the design task at hand and is worded in a way that limits the scope of the ideas to \nbe produced, but does not constrain the group to think about current technologies and \npractices. The session seeks the generation of ideas about activities rather than technologies \nof the far future.  \n \nA brainstorming session follows based on this question, where the list of ideas is recorded by \none of the facilitators on a flip-chart pad. Table #3 shows examples of priming questions from \nworkshops we have run on various design tasks. It is important that the moderator encourages \nthe participants to focus on the far future, to overcome today\u2019s technological restrictions in \ntheir thinking. Thus, in the third example in Table #3 participants were encouraged to think \nwhat they would want to be doing in 50 years time with regard to learning about collaborative \nmedia making; in the other two examples they were advised to think \u201cspace age \n \nIn the first two examples in Table #3 the moderator mentioned that the participants may \nassume they have available \u201cany kind of gadgets and props\u201d they may need, whereas in the \nthird example there was no direct mention of technology. Much of the responsibility lies with \nthe facilitator to focus the discussion on activity rather than technology, in the future rather \nthan the present (e.g., by asking \u201cwhat sort of activities would you want to do with this \ntechnology?\u201d).  \n \n \n \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n11  \nTable #3. Example of priming questions used to initiate brainstorming in Imagineering sessions. \n \nDesign project: Design future digital imaging technologies \n1st Workshop Iteration (objective: generate design ideas) \nImagine that you are far in the future; that the artefacts you use in your everyday life \nhave evolved and changed. Imagine that you have available there any kind of gadgets \nand props that you may need to help you to capture and share visual events and \nexperiences. What kind of activities do you think you would want to be able to do in \nthat situation? \nPrimary activity: to capture and share visual events and experiences \nDesign project: Design future technology to support informal science learning \n2nd Workshop Iteration (objective: refine ideas produced in first iteration of \nworkshop) \nImagine that you are far in the future; that the artefacts you use in your everyday life \nhave evolved and changed. Imagine that you have available there any kind of gadgets \nand props that you may need to help you to learn science by exploring your \nenvironment now and in the past. What kind of activities do you think you would \nwant to perform in that situation? \nTHINK SPACE AGE \nPrimary activity (explored in first workshop): to learn science \nRefined activity (outcome of first workshop): learn science by exploring your \nenvironment now and in the past \nDesign project: Design future technology to support collaborative media making \n2nd Workshop Iteration (objective: generate requirements for future collaborative \nmedia making activities and technologies) \nImagine that you are far in the future\u2026 and you want to\u2026 \nLEARN COLLABORATIVELY ABOUT MEDIA MAKING \nBut you are so far in the future that the artefacts you use in your everyday life have \nevolved and changed\u2026 As have the media that you want to learn how to make\u2026 \nWhat does media making look like? What kind of activities do you perform to learn \nabout it? \nPrimary activity: learn about collaborative media making \n \nThe purpose of the Imagineering session is to set the scene and get the participants to think in \nterms of the future, with respect not only to technology, but most importantly to the activities \nand needs that necessitate it. The session acts as a precursor to the modelling session. The \noutcome of the Imagineering session is a list of envisioned activities (usually complemented \nby early suggestions for envisioned technology) that people would like to be able to perform \nin the future. A side effect of this session is that it sets the participants to imagine the far \nfuture. \n \n \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 12 \nSession 2 \u2013 Modelling \nAt a glance: Participants create low-tech prototypes of future activity contexts \nDuration: 40-50 minutes (time required by small groups to conceptualise and create the \nprototypes) \nTechniques: Low-tech prototyping workshop \nNumber of Researchers: 2-3, depending on number of participants\u2019 sub-groups \u2013 making \ndetailed notes of the modelling exercise according to the observation sheet; one researcher \nalso runs the session (introduction, time-keeping, announcements, etc.) \nPurpose: To set the participants to imagine the far future and produce models of useful and \nmeaningful technology and activity contexts. \nOutcomes: (a) Models produced by the groups and their written descriptions \n(b) Videos of the modelling activities and presentations \n(c) The facilitators\u2019 observation notes during modelling \n(d) The facilitators\u2019 notes during the groups\u2019 presentations \nTable 2 grid box: 4 \u2013 Future activity and technology \nPlacement in time: Far future \n \nThis session continues the exploration of box 4 in Table #2, the far future. The participants \nare divided into two or three groups and are provided with a set of low-tech prototyping \nmaterials, such as Play-Doh\u00ae3, coloured pencils and paper, Post-it\u00ae notes, and sticky paper. \n(These are usually the contents one or more children\u2019s craft kits, complemented with Play-\nDoh\u00ae and standard stationery items.)  \n \nAs Buchenau and Fulton (2000) note,  \n \n\u201clow-tech solutions seem to promote the attitude that it is the design question that \nis important, not the tools and techniques that can be brought to bear\u201d (p. 431).  \n \nThe facilitator asks the groups to confer in order to select one or more of the ideas produced \nduring the first session and to build a model that will demonstrate how the relevant activities \nare performed. The groups are encouraged to choose different ideas, but this is not \ncompulsory. Asking the workshop participants to work in smaller groups has the advantage \nthat more ideas can be explored; but also gives each participant more chances to influence the \ndesigns. As with the Imagineering session, the focus during modelling stays on activities: the \ngroups are instructed to avoid producing detailed designs of technology, but rather to create \nmodels of activity contexts along with any necessary technology props. Hence, the focus is on \nfunctionality rather than detailed interface design. \n \nLow-tech prototyping has been extensively researched and used in interface design (Virzi \n1990). One of the first methods to utilise low-tech prototyping was PICTIVE (Muller 1991), \nwhich required design participants to come up with interface designs to given technology \nsolutions. End users are involved in design, however this is after the technology conception \nphase, so the method fails to support user participation in design innovation:  \n \n\u201cfor innovative technologies PICTIVE is probably not useful until the technology \nhas been developed to the point that it is ready to be applied to a practical \nproblem\u201d (Muller op. cit., p. 229).  \n \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n13  \nOther approaches engage users earlier in the design process. For example, Inkpen (1999) \ninvolved children in a participatory, low-tech prototyping session to design future handheld \ntechnologies that they would like to have. The difference between such sessions and the FTW \nmodelling session is that in the FTW the participants are briefed to shift their focus from the \ntechnology itself to what they would like to do with it: their mission is not just to design \ntechnology of the future, but to imagine their lives in the future and how technology could \nsupport it.  \n \nThe modelling sessions are video-taped for later analysis. Muller (1991) has identified a \nvaluable role for video records of modelling sessions:  \n \n\u201cThe video record \u2026 will serve as a dynamic presentation of the design, as a \nconversational rationale for that design and for the decisions underlying the \ndesign, and as a means for communicating concretely the different views of \ndifferent participants\u201d (p. 226).  \n \nHowever useful they may be, video records are burdensome to analyse: long videos are hard \nto index and labour intensive to scan. It is therefore recommended that a number of \nfacilitators (one per design group) observe the groups to make notes of the issues, debates and \nideas that are produced, together with information about who initiated them and when4. The \nvideo record then serves as a resource for the analyst for more detailed information as and \nwhen necessary. \n \nAt the end of the modelling session, the groups are asked to write short descriptions of their \nmodels, and to present them to the whole team. Summing up, their model assists the group \nmembers to articulate their design and reflect on the modelling experience. The presentations \nare video recorded while the facilitator(s) make notes for each model about the technology \nfeatures and functions. \nSession 3 \u2013 Role Play \n \nAt a glance: The participants build scenarios about the use of the models and act them out \nDuration: 30 minutes (time required to build and enact scenarios) \nTechniques: Scenario building and Role-play \nNumber of Researchers: At least 1 \nPurpose: To bring the future into the present, by getting participants to \u201cact\u201d as if future \ntechnologies were already there to support new activities, and also to have them engaged in \nthe future activities and make their conceptions of them more tangible. \nOutcomes: (a) The videos of the performed scenarios \n(b) The facilitators\u2019 notes during role-play and scenario discussion \nTable 2 grid box: 4 \u2013 Future activity and technology \nPlacement in time: Far future \n \nContinuing the exploration of box 4 in Table #2, this session asks the groups to exchange \nmodels, to plot a scenario demonstrating how the model might be used, and then to enact it. \nThe building and enacting of scenarios have been used extensively in system design. Rosson \nand Carroll (2003) present different uses of scenarios throughout the system development \nlifecycle, ranging from capturing requirements and design rationale to guiding formative and \nsummative evaluations. B\u00f8dker (1999) discusses three uses of scenarios in design concept \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 14 \ndevelopment: to investigate users\u2019 actions with a not yet existing artefact, for focused testing \nof design ideas or interface aspects, or for providing input to brainstorming about design ideas \nwhere the designers get a feeling for use (present and future) by acting out scenarios. She \nargues that  \n \n\u201cgood scenarios are not a detached description of user tasks and actions, but \nselective scripts or stories that stage user actions with a future artefact. They are \nmeans of holding on to situations, and how they may be changed because of a \ndesign. They represent the reflection over situations, problems or solutions and \nfacilitate action, such as hands-on prototypes or simulations\u201d (B\u00f8dker op. cit., p. \n8).  \n \nIacucci et al. (2002) emphasise the importance of what they term \u2018interactional creativity\u2019 in \nscenario building: scenarios developed ad-hoc through the participants\u2019 interactions and \nreactions to each others\u2019 input can evolve to address their concerns about, and perspectives of, \na given situation. \n \nDuring the FTW role-play session, the scenario building activity serves all the \nabovementioned goals. It helps the participant groups to appreciate the possibilities offered by \neach others\u2019 models and to instantiate and explore future use of the models in situations of \ntheir choice. Structured scenario-building techniques may be employed, for example the \n\u2018who-where-when-what-how-idea\u2019 cards discussed in Ihlstr\u00f6m et al. (2005). The exchange of \nmodels at this stage is important, as it allows a first attempt at exploring the appropriation of \nnew technology, as a consequence of its introduction into people\u2019s lives. Iacucci et al. (2002) \nargue that \u201cone of the aims of design is to deliver systems that can be appropriated by people \nin real life\u201d (p 175), and the phenomenon of tool appropriation has been documented in \nresearch by Waycott (2004). Furthermore, while working with someone else\u2019s design the \nparticipants can be more critical than if working on their own designs to which a certain \ndegree of \u2018emotional attachment\u2019 might exist. Finally, the models have the chance to benefit \nfrom all participants\u2019 perspectives and agendas rather than only from the sub-group of \nparticipants who designed them, allowing possible conflicts to surface and be considered. \n \nThe subsequent acting out and discussion of the scenarios allows the participants to \ncommunicate, and receive feedback on, their conceptualisations to the rest of the team. At the \nsame time, the participants are called to actively \u2018live\u2019 the situations they have envisaged, to \nhave as close to first-hand an experience of the envisioned context of use as possible. Iacucci \net al. (2002) identify three roles for performances in the design process: to explore new ideas \nthrough acting out scenarios; to communicate new concepts and designs to prospective \ncustomers for early feedback or to design teams for further concept development; and to test \ndesign ideas with prospective users who may discover problems and make suggestions for \nimprovements. The role-play in FTW serves all of these roles, with the last one made possible \nby allowing the rest of the team to comment on the scenario that is played out. \n \nThe combination of the modelling and role-play sessions resembles what Buchenau and \nFulton (2000) designate as Experience Prototyping, which they describe as representations \ndesigned to understand, explore or communicate what it might be like to engage with the \nproduct, space or system that is designed. \n \nAfter a group has role-played a scenario, the group that had originally designed the model is \nasked whether the enactment matched their initial conception of the model, what differences \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n15  \nthey can see, and any related issues. This typically short discussion aids the consolidation of \nviews and perspectives in the feedback gained. \n \nAs with the modelling session, the role-play session is documented on video and in  \nstructured notes taken by the facilitators, on specially formatted paper, covering the activities \npresented, the actors, their consequences in terms of the plot, and the outcomes in terms of the \ninvolved technology. In addition, the facilitator(s) make structured notes of the differences \nbetween the designers\u2019 and performers\u2019 conceptions of the models. \nSession 4 \u2013 Retrofit \n \nAt a glance: The participants modify the scenarios so as to make use of existing technology \nonly \nDuration: 30 minutes (time required to modify and enact scenarios) \nTechniques: Scenario building and Role-play \nNumber of Researchers: At least 1 \nPurpose: To bring the future into present everyday life, setting the participants to think how \nthe futuristic activities they have imagined so far might be adapted into their current lives. \nOutcomes: (a) The videos of the performed scenarios \n(b) The facilitators\u2019 notes during role-play  \n(c) A list of the identified technological gaps for supporting future activities \nTable 2 grid box: 3 \u2013 Future activity with current technology \nPlacement in time: Present \n \nThis session explores box 3 of the grid in Table #2 and is situated at the present time. In \nRetrofit, the groups are asked to modify their scenarios from the previous session so that any \nuse of futuristic technology is omitted and they only make use of existing technologies in \ntheir stories. This is an exercise to ground the \u2018visionary\u2019 work the participants have done in \nthe previous sessions back in reality. The participants are invited to see the relevance of the \nfuture to the present, to explore whether they can already do the future activities they have \nenvisioned without the need for new technologies, to estimate how difficult or complicated \nthat would be, and to appreciate how new technology might improve life. Scenario \nmodification and performance play the same roles as scenario building and performance in \nthe previous session. \n \nTo facilitate the participants in thinking about currently available technology, a range of \nrelevant existing technologies can be displayed together with gadget catalogues, and basic \nfunctionality can be described (for example, in the workshops for digital imaging, \ntechnologies such as digital and analogue still and video cameras were set out on a table and \nwere available for use in the scenarios5). Prototypes that have been constructed based on \nprevious workshop iterations may also be demonstrated at this stage. \n \nThe Retrofit session is documented in a similar way to the Role-play session, with the only \ndifference being that, instead of documenting the debate between model designers and \nperformers at the end of the role play, the facilitators make notes of future activities that are \nnot supported at all, or not supported adequately, by existing technology as these may be \nareas that afford the introduction of new tools. \n \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 16 \nSession 5 \u2013 Everyday \n \nAt a glance: The participants list their current activities and problems in carrying them out. \nDuration: 10-15 minutes (time required to produce a diverse list of current activities and \nrelated problems) \nTechniques: Group discussion \nNumber of Researchers: At least 1 \nPurpose: To get participants thinking about their current practices in relation to the design \ntask and how they could be improved in the future. \nOutcomes: (a) A list of current activities performed using current technology \n(b) A list of related problems \nTable 2 grid box: 1 \u2013 Current activity with current technology \nPlacement in time: Present and recent past \n \nThis session explores box 1 of the grid in Table #2 and is situated in the present and recent \npast. The participants, working as a single group, are asked to list ideas about what activities \nthey currently perform using existing technology, in relation to the design activity that was \nintroduced in session 1 (for example, to capture and share visual events). To facilitate \nthinking, the facilitator shows the group photos of current technologies (for example, pictures \nfrom a technology catalogue) and demonstrates existing gadgets relevant to the design task, as \nin the Retrofit session. The participants are then asked to think back to related activities that \nthey performed in the last few weeks. Once a list of current activities is produced, the \nparticipants are then asked to identify relevant problems and shortcomings of the existing \ntechnologies and practices. The facilitator(s) notes the current activities and problems in two \ncolumns on a flip-chart and the sheet remains on display for the remainder of the workshop. \n \nGaver, Dunne, and Pacenti (1999) proposed the use of \u2018cultural probes\u2019, which are kits of \nmaterials such as disposable cameras and diaries, as a means to inspire people to reflect on \ntheir lives in different ways. Instantiating the technique in technology design, Hutchinson et \nal. (2003) proposed the use of \u2018technology probes\u2019, which are prototypes of some piece of \n(new) technology, as a means to encourage people to reflect on their everyday practices and \nconceive of new uses and functionality for technology. The Everyday session in the FTW \nserves the purpose of reminding participants of what activities they currently perform and the \nproblems they face in operating current technology. Since this is done in the context of the \npreceding sessions where participants were envisaging new technologies and activities, the \nEveryday session serves as a probe itself, encouraging reflection on the gap between where \nthe participants currently are and where they want to go. \nSession 6 \u2013 Futurefit \n \nAt a glance: The participants modify their models to support current as well as future \nactivity, and try to \u2018sell\u2019 them to the rest of the team. \nDuration: 50-60 minutes (time required to modify models and \u2018sell\u2019 them) \nTechniques: Brainstorming, Scenario building, Performing \nNumber of Researchers: At least 1 \nPurpose: To set the participants thinking about what types of future technology will be used \nto support the activities they currently perform, as well as to obtain a list of implicit \nrequirements for technology based on the way the models are advertised. \nOutcomes: (a) List of near-future technologies to support current activities \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n17  \n(b) List of implicit requirements (what the designed models can do and what the \u2018prospective \ncustomers\u2019 appear to want them to do) \nTable 2 grid box: 2 \u2013 Current activity with future technology \nPlacement in time: Near future \n \nSession 6 explores box 2 of the grid in Table #2 and is situated in the near future. The group \nis asked to look at the current activities and problems that were produced in the previous \nsession and discuss how they think those current activities will be performed in the near \nfuture. During a brainstorming activity, the whole team produces a list of future technologies \nthat will address the problems they have with their existing practices. The facilitator records \non a flip-chart the ideas that are produced. \n \nNext, the facilitator prompts the participants to think of the envisaged solutions in relation to \nthe models they had built earlier: the groups are prompted to think about technology and \nactivity that will be achievable in the next five years, and are asked to modify their initial \nmodels to accommodate as many of the current activities identified as possible while solving \nas many related problems as possible, and still supporting the previously envisaged activities. \nThis session blends the present and the future and encourages participants to create a \u2018unified\u2019 \nvision of emerging technologies and activities. \n \nThe participant groups are then asked to devise an advert for their modified models and \npresent it for the other groups in order to convince them to \u2018buy\u2019 their product. The other \ngroups have the chance to say whether and why they would buy it or not. This selling exercise \nis documented by the facilitator, who makes notes on a flip-chart about what each group \nconsiders to be the strong points of their model (as emphasised in the advert), as well as the \nmain points made by the replies from the \u2018customers\u2019 and the \u2018designers\u2019. These notes can be \nthe basis for producing a list of implicit requirements, based on what the participants consider \nto be important features of each model. \nSession 7 \u2013 Requirements \n \nAt a glance: The participants list requirements for future technology \nDuration: 15-20 minutes (time required to examine models and scenarios and list \nrequirements) \nTechniques: Focus group discussion \nNumber of Researchers: At least 1 \nPurpose: To get participants to explicate their requirements for future technology \nOutcomes: An explicit list of requirements for future technology \nTable 2 grid box: 2 and 4 \u2013 Future and current activity with future technology \nPlacement in time: Near future \n \nThis session relates to boxes 2 and 4 of the grid in Table #2 and is concerned with \nrequirements for new technology and activity in the near future. The whole group is asked to \nproduce a set of requirements for each model, based on their experience of the previous \nsessions and their needs. Requirements are described to the participants as the set of \ninstructions they would give to an engineer who would be willing to implement the model. \nThe group is also asked to identify the two most important requirements for each model, and \nare then asked to rate individually the requirements on a scale between 1 and 5, with 5 having \nthe most importance\/appeal. \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 18 \n \nThe Requirements session is the climax of the Future Technology Workshop. Through the \npreceding sessions, the participants have imagined, modelled, and experienced activities and \ntechnologies of the future. This route has enabled them to reflect and gain insights into what \nactivities in the far future might be like in relation to the design task at hand, thus preparing \nthem to specify their requirements for emerging, or near future technology with sufficient \naccuracy. \n \nTiming and participants \n \nSmith (1998) divides the design process of new-generation products into three stages: \nExploratory Design, Concept Refinement and Analysis, and Formal Design. The Future \nTechnology Workshop targets primarily the first stage, Exploratory Design, which aims to \nidentify and conceptualise potential new high-value products and services. Thus, the best time \nto conduct an FTW is during product conception, as it offers a user-centred, structured \napproach to creativity and innovation in concept development.  \n \nThe choice of participants for an FTW depends on the purpose of the workshop. End users, \n\u2018everyday people\u2019 with no personal agendas with regard to the workshop objective, promise \nmore impartial input. Involving those whom von Hippel (1986) calls \u2018lead users\u2019, (users who \nface needs that will be general in the marketplace, but face them months or years before the \nbulk of the marketplace encounters them; and who will benefit significantly by obtaining a \nsolution to those needs) can be advantageous, as  \n \n\u201calthough the insights of lead users are as constrained to the familiar as those of \nother users, lead users are familiar with conditions which lie in the future for \nmost \u2013 and so are in a position to provide accurate data on needs related to such \nfuture conditions\u201d (p. 796).  \n \nInvolving designers as well as end users guarantees an element of feasibility in the resulting \nconcepts. For specialised areas, the involvement of experts pays off in terms of informed \nconcepts; for example, involving educational experts when the objective is to design tools for \nlearning. Different types of participant can be involved in a single workshop, maintaining \nmixed participant groups. Alternatively, iterations of the workshop with different participant \ngroups can build on previous workshop outcomes. Furthermore, \u2018re-using\u2019 participants from \nparticipant groups in future FTW iterations can be useful, as they have had time to reflect on \ntheir ideas and practices and provide more \u2018mature\u2019 input than new participants. \n \nExamples of the use of Future Technology Workshops  \n \nThe Future Technology Workshops has been successfully adopted by ourselves and others in \na variety of projects, with both children and adults. A summary of some applications of the \nmethod follows. They show its use a) with children leading to the design of an innovative \nproduct, b) with adult volunteers as part of requirements gathering for a major technology \ndesign project, c) with research academics to envision future scenarios for learning, and d) \nwith children to engage them in technology design. \n \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n19  \nFTW for \u2018capturing and sharing visual events\u2019 \n \nThe FTW was developed during the Children as Photographers project (Sharples, Davison, \nThomas, & Rudman, 2003), where we undertook a series of five workshops with children \naged 10-13 (Vavoula et al.. 2002; Vavoula, Sharples, Cross, & Baber, 2003) and adults, \nfocusing on the theme of future activities and technologies related to capturing and sharing \nvisual events and experiences.  \n \n  \n(a)                                   (b) \nFigure #2. Models produced by children (aged 10-13) who participated in FTWs for \u2018capturing and \nsharing visual events\u2019: (a) The \u2018Underwater Camera\u2019 \u2013 a camera than can be remotely controlled while \nit explores the deep sea and sends back images to its owner, (b) The Mobile MemoCam (top) \u2013 a \ncamera with autonomous movement that can remember where items of interest are and can go to \nphotograph them; and SpyGlasses (bottom) -.a miniature camera is hidden in the glasses frame, \nallowing the owner to take photographs spy-style. \n \n \nThe main concepts that the children devised during the first two workshops were those of \n\u2018spy\u2019 cameras (miniature cameras hidden on the body that can capture everyday events, or \nrelay the images to another person) and \u2018robot\u2019 cameras, where a camera is attached to \nanother person, an animal or an object such as a remote control submarine, with the images \nviewed at a distance (see Figure #2a, b). The outcomes of these workshops were \ncomplemented with an additional two workshops with adults, one on the same theme of \ncapturing and sharing visual experiences, and the other on a theme that emerged in the \nprevious workshops on \u201cgetting immersed in the sights and sounds of another place and\/or \ntime\u201d. The general requirements that resulted from all five workshops can be summarised as \nfollows: \n \n\u2022 Ability to view the world through the eyes of another person or other living being \no Ability to capture that view \no Ability to intervene in \/ control that view \n\u2022 Ability to share experience instantly \n\u2022 Ability to share not only visual experience but other modalities too (sound, touch, \nsmell, etc.) \n\u2022 Record of personal experience over a lifetime \n\u2022 Automatic, prompt availability without the need for switching on, logging in, etc. \n\u2022 Fast enough to capture the moment instantly \n\u2022 Discreet \/ secret \/ unobtrusive technology \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 20 \n\u2022 Durable, portable, reliable \n\u2022 Cheap \n \nA team at the University of Birmingham then built a \u201cSpyCam\u201d device that combined \nelements of both the spy and remote camera, based on the requirements listed above (Vavoula \net al. 2003). The prototype consisted of an inexpensive wireless mini colour camera, mounted \non a pair of sunglasses (see Figure #3a, b), which transmits a colour composite video signal to \na portable computer (a Panasonic Toughbook) that has a separate wirelessly connected \nhandheld screen. Thus, the camera and the view screen can be carried separately, each with a \nrange of about 100 metres from the base-station. We used the SpyCam in two configurations. \nIn the first, one child wore the glasses and another held the Toughbook screen. The child with \nthe screen had a continuous transmission of what the other child was seeing, and could tap the \nscreen at any time to capture a still frame (for example, a child holding the screen could see \nwhat another child saw as she was going down the zip wire at a holiday camp). The children \nwere able to communicate by voice through \u2018walkie-talkie\u2019 handheld radios. This \nconfiguration exemplified the remotely controlled camera idea. In the second configuration, a \nchild wore the glasses with the attached camera and also had a wireless remote control key-\nfob. A press of the key-fob button sent a command to the Toughbook to take a picture. This \nconfiguration exemplified the spyglasses camera idea (see Figure #3a). \n \nDifferent scenarios were tested for both configurations, with 32 children at a residential \neducation and activity centre, none of whom had participated in an FTW. We also carried out \ntests using two blindfolded treasure hunt games, designed to exploit the features of the \nSpyCam prototype. The trials revealed that the children found no difficulty in operating the \nequipment.  \n \nAll the children gave very positive responses to the question of whether they enjoyed it, for \nexample: \n  \n \u201cIt was just like, you didn't have to worry about holding it or nothing it was just, \nalways on you and easy to use, because if you wanted to take a photo just tell \nthem, just push the button\u201d (boy, age 13) \n \u201cI liked that you could see what they were seeing instead of just seeing what you \ncould... instead of just looking at them and trying to imagine what they could see\u201d \n(girl, age 11) \n \nWhat seemed to impress them the most was the ability to see what someone else was seeing \nin real time, the ability to control where someone else goes, the need to trust someone\u2019s \ninstructions on how to move and what to do, and the choice of whether to take a photograph \nor not. The new possibilities offered by the concepts that emerged from the FTW were \nenjoyable, fascinating new activities for the children who tried them. \n \nThe third and final children\u2019s workshop (fifth workshop in total) was carried out with a \ndifferent group of six children, again three boys and three girls. This workshop built on the \noutcomes of the previous ones, with the children being shown the prototypes and asked how \nthey could be altered or improved during the \u2018retrofit\u2019 and \u2018everyday\u2019 sessions. The design \ntask therefore related to \u201ccapturing visual events remotely, without being noticed\u201d. The \nchildren converged on a design that includes a camera which can attach to a variety of objects \nsuch as sunglasses and wrist watches. Our initial prototypes were therefore expanded to \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n21  \ninclude, besides the SpyCam on the sunglasses, a RoboCam employing a model car operated \nby remote control with the miniature camera mounted on top. The camera can easily be \nremoved from the glasses frame and attached to the roof of the car, which the children can \nthen operate by the remote control and receive the image from the camera on to a computer \nmonitor or on a small-screen TV. \n \n \n   \n(a)                                          (b)                                             (c) \nFigure #3.  Prototypes developed based on the ideas and requirements produced during FTWs for \n\u2018capturing and sharing visual events\u2019: (a) The \u2018SpyCam\u2019 \u2013 child wearing sunglasses with miniature \ncamera mounted on, which transmits a video signal to a Panasonic Toughbook that has a separate \nwirelessly connected handheld screen. The screen is held by another child (not shown in the photo) \nwho can see the view from this child\u2019s camera. Audio communication between the two children is \nenabled by walkie-talkies (shown in child\u2019s hand). (b) The \u2018RoboCam\u2019:  a miniature camera is \nattached to roof of a model car which can be operated by remote control (not shown). The signal from \ncamera is received on to a computer monitor, which children not co-located with the model car can \ninspect. (c) Children are gathered around the RoboCam control table, looking at the image transmitted \nfrom the roof of the model car (not shown). The model car is controlled by another child (not shown), \nwho receives requests and suggestions on how to manoeuvre the car via walkie-talkie. \n \n \nThe new prototypes were tested with the same six children who participated in the second \nworkshop, in two scenarios. The first scenario was a blindfolded treasure hunt, where one \nchild was blindfolded and wore the spyglasses and the other children instructed her to wander \naround another room and collect clues. The second scenario involved collaborative solving of \na mystery and made use of the RoboCam. Six pieces of paper containing key information \nabout the mystery were put around a room different to the one where the children were, at \nfloor level. One child navigated the RoboCam through the remote control, and the other five \nchildren watched the image sent by the RoboCam and instructed the navigator-child where to \nsend the car (see Figure #3c). \n \nThe children enjoyed both scenarios and had no trouble in operating and making use of either \nthe SpyCam or the RoboCam. As with the previous trials, shortcomings of the technology in \nterms of performance were not off-putting and the children were more interested in the live \nimage than the photographs they were able to capture. The same children then participated in \nthe final children\u2019s workshop. They were asked to go through the workshop refining the \ndesigns and expanding the ideas of the RoboCam and the SpyCam. The imagineering session \nmainly produced a list of things on which the SpyCam could be mounted: briefcases, \nwristwatches, sunglasses, dog collars, model boats and many more. \n \nIn summary, the FTW was successful in producing requirements for novel and implementable \ntechnology for children. New digital imaging devices were designed and prototyped from \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 22 \nrequirements generated by two iterations of the FTW method. Thus, the method fulfills the \ninitial aim of fitting within a process of human-centred systems development while generating \ndesigns and requirements for radically new technology.  \nFTW for \u2018training First Aid volunteers\u2019 \n \nThe FTW was adopted by the MOBIlearn project, funded by the European Commission \nInformation Society Technologies programme, for the design of mobile technology for \nlearning. One scenario in MOBIlearn was to aid the training of adult first-aid volunteers \n(Evans and Taylor 2004, Sharp, Rogers & Preece 2007). Whereas the focus in the Children as \nPhotographers project was to develop new product concepts, in MOBIlearn the objective was \nto produce general requirements for mobile support of trainee first-aiders. The participants \nwere first-aid volunteers from the Open University, UK, and the models they produced \nincluded, among others, a \u2018diagnostic machine\u2019: a kit that, when applied to the person in need, \nassesses their situation accurately and assists the first-aid worker to report the incident \nappropriately. To produce the requirements, all the FTW sessions were transcribed and the \ntranscripts were analysed by identifying current and future tools and artefacts and their use \n(Mwanza, Taylor, Sharp, & Vavoula, 2003). These were then translated into design \nrequirements and recorded in a structured format, along with MOBIlearn requirements from \nother sources (Sharp et al. 2003; Haley, Nuseibeh, Sharp, & Taylor, 2004; Taylor 2004). The \nFTW method was useful in informing the requirements gathering process for MOBIlearn, \nAlthough the \u2018diagnostic machine\u2019 concept was not developed further, requirements \ndeveloped at the workshop, such as incorporation of \u2018scanners\u2019 for capturing and storing \ninformation, were included as requirements for the MOBIlearn system. \nFTW for \u2018informal science learning in mobile settings\u2019 \n \nAs part of a project (MELISSA) within the Kaleidoscope European Network of Excellence \n(www.noe-kaleidoscope.org), we investigated informal science learning in mobile settings \n(Vavoula et al. 2005a). The participants in this FTW were ten members of the project research \nteam, plus two external experts in mobile learning.  \n \nThe FTW focused on the design of future technologies and activities related to learning in \ninformal science settings. Two main models were developed, including a model featuring \n\u2018whisperers\u2019 (agents that sit on a user\u2019s shoulder and whisper in their ear information about \ntheir social context), and one featuring \u2018zoom and time travel\u2019 (while moving around an urban \nsetting, a person has the opportunity to zoom into some part of that environment, moving \nfrom a macro to a micro view, to understand how it is constructed; and they can also \u2018travel \nback in time\u2019 to see what that environment looked like in the past). The two models were \ndeveloped further during the FTW sessions, concluding with a list of general requirements for \neach model. The requirements produced during the FTW formed the input for a force-field \nanalysis (Thomas 1985), a focus group method for the identification of \u2018helpers\u2019 and \n\u2018hinderers\u2019, i.e., factors that contribute towards or against achieving the vision specified by \nthe requirements. Later, the models produced were examined in relation to specific learning \ntheories in order to identify how they fit with each theory. \n \nWithin this project, the FTW was successfully used for a different purpose to the previous \nones, namely to envision the future of a research area. Starting with summaries of extensive \nreviews of the area, involving domain experts, and augmenting the workshop with additional \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n23  \nsessions such as the force-field analysis and the theory-fit, the result was a well-informed \nvision of requirements for informal science learning in the future (Vavoula, Lonsdale, \nMwanza, Scanlon, & Hardy, 2005b). \n \nEvidence of success \nThe case studies presented in the previous section described how the FTW was used in the \nChildren as Photographers project for concept design (Vavoula et al. 2003); in the MOBIlearn \nproject as a requirements analysis method (Sharp et al. 2007); and in the MELISSA project as \na means to conceptualise the potential of a new type of technology (i.e., mobile technology) \nin supporting learning.  \n \nThe FTW has directly informed the design of prototypes that are \u2018engineerable\u2019 in that they \ncould conceivably be realised through present-day engineering methods. Two of these \nprototypes have been implemented and tested with children, as described in the first case \nstudy. \n \nThe costs for running a FTW are minimal: any room with enough space to comfortably fit the \nparticipant groups is adequate; the materials used (craft kits) are low-cost; and the training \nrequired for the participants is limited to presenting them with a set of instructions at the start \nof each session. Although it is recommended that certain sessions are videotaped, the hand \nnotes on specially formatted paper also speed up the analysis process with the first results \nreadily available at the end of the requirements session. This enables FTW to be adopted for \ncommercial projects requiring rapid development. \n \nIn the introduction we set out requirements for a design method that is aimed at the \nconception and design of radically new or disruptive technologies: technologies that empower \nlearners, workers and other users to realise their aspirations for new, desirable activities. The \nFuture Technology Workshop meets all these requirements: \n \na) Minimal participant training. We have used the FTW in projects with adults and \nchildren with no prior training in software design. In all cases participants have been \nable to envision, enact and analyse collaborative interactions with new technologies \nafter only brief descriptions of what each workshop session involves. \nb) Collaborative. The FTW is designed to explore and design group activities for learning \nand creativity.  All the sessions are group-based and include whole-group idea \ngeneration, small-group modelling and role-play, and whole-group critique, discussion \nand requirements forming.   \nc) Direct input to design. The FTW integrates well with the socio-cognitive engineering \napproach described in the introduction to this paper. The sessions have produced \nrequirements for technology that has been successfully engineered and deployed. \nd) Cost-effective to run. The FTW has no specific requirements for the room where it \ntakes place as long as it can accommodate the required number of participants and can \noffer quiet corners for small group work. The workshop does not involve the use of \nexpensive equipment and can be run in any adequately sized meeting room. It can be \nrun in half day. \ne) Relates people and technology. The FTW starts with a focus on what participants \nwould like to be able to do in the future and the focus throughout the workshop remains \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 24 \non the socio-technical systems they envision (rather than on the technology involved) \nthrough predicting and refining contexts and situations of use.  \nf) Open-ended. The FTW starts by giving participants a very broadly defined activity \narea rather than a specific design objective. Thus, participants are free to explore and \ndefine the form and scope of the new socio-technical system in an open-ended manner. \ng) Pragmatic. Although the first three FTW sessions are placed in the far future where \nparticipants are free to envision socio-technical systems that include fanciful and \nimpracticable technologies, the following sessions ground these visions in the present \nand encourage participants to project the present and the far future into the near future \nto end up with visions that can conceivably be designed by practical present-day \nengineering methods. \n \nThe FTW enables participants to envision emerging socio-technical systems as opposed to \nnew technologies intended only to replace existing ones in established practice. It provides a \nframework for the systematic envisioning of such systems by taking participants on an \nexploration of the far future, through the present and recent past, to reflect upon their needs \nand aspirations and conceptualise what is desirable but also achievable in the near future. In \nthis sense, the FTW puts together well established design techniques in a novel way that can \ndirectly and creatively inform design. \n \nWe have systematically evaluated the participant experience through questionnaires \nadministered after each FTW, The responses show that participating in a FTW is an enjoyable \nand interesting activity. Some typical responses are shown below: \n \n \u201cWhen people are relaxed they tend to think in a more free-form way. I enjoy the \nbrainstorming that goes on, which often begins with fun and laughter, but which \nthen begins to focus and home in on some really interesting ideas\u201d \n\u201cThe need to represent the imagined situation by means of a kind of \u2018art work\u2019 \nand a short play helped to make the imagination activity more concrete and more \nlive. The fact that the play had to represent the situation imagined by another \ngroup stimulted me to pay more attention to other people visions that I would \nhave done otherwise.\u201d \n \u201cThe whole thing is very coherent - each stage leads to the next - and at the end \nit feels as though a cycle has been completed \u2026 I think it makes good use of the \nexpertise and skills of the group involved - so that the whole is more than the \nparts\u201d \n\u201cIt's a very useful method for thinking 'outside the box' but also grounds that \nthinking back in reality, theory etc.\u201d \n \nHowever, some participants also expressed concerns about the \u2018playfulness\u2019 that the \nworkshop sessions infuse:  \n \n\u201c(I liked) the distraction of the materials and the social engagement... but it did \ndistract from the 'issue(s)'\u201d \n\u201cThe fun bit can be a disadvantage because people can get carried away in \nplayfulness and fail to connect the significance of activities to the design process\u201d \n \nMuch of the responsibility to keep participants on track, albeit within a fun and enjoyable \natmosphere, lies with the moderator(s) who need to discretely and continually observe the \nPre-print  To appear in: \n Intenational Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning \n Volume 2, Issue 4, December 2007 \n25  \nparticipant groups and make interventions when a group seems distracted from their task for a \nprolonged time.  \n \nA potential limitation of the method is that the results of an FTW are based on technology in \nan imagined context. It is inevitable that the designs will be out of context, since the objective \nof an FTW is to design disruptive technology that changes or introduces new practice. \nRemoving participants from their everyday settings and exploring new contexts of use is \nnecessary if they are expected to re-conceptualise their needs and practices. Attention \ntherefore needs to be paid to the validation of FTW outcomes by, for example, combining \nFTW iterations from different participants along with focus groups, user surveys, and other \nmethods of observing user practices in everyday contexts. \n \nIn our applications of the FTW so far we have mainly used it to understand the possibilities \nfor interactions between new technologies and new types of activity in the future. It may thus \nbe argued that an implicit assumption is made that technology is a natural solution to \nproblems. In fact, this implicit assumption might lie behind all system design, otherwise \nattention would be turned to devising other kinds of solution. However, the FTW recognises \nthe need to analyse the role this technology will come to play in people\u2019s lives, by \nproblematising whether, and if so how, people\u2019s aspirations might be satisfied by technology. \n \nConclusions  \n \nThe Future Technology Workshop (FTW) offers a context in which people with knowledge or \nexperience in a specific area of technology use, explore and design the interactions between \ncurrent and future technology and activity. The FTW provides a framework for the systematic \nenvisioning of emerging socio-technical systems by taking participants on an exploration of \nthe far future, through the present and recent past, to reflect upon their needs and aspirations \nand conceptualise what is desirable but also achievable in the near future. Through a series of \nstructured workshop sessions participants collaborate to envisage future activities related to \ntechnology design, build models of use contexts of future technologies, act out scenarios of \nuse for their models, re-conceive their scenarios in relation to present-day technologies, list \nproblems with carrying out the scenarios, explore the gap between current and future \ntechnology and activity, and end by listing requirements for future technology.  \n \nThe method has been used successfully with children and adults to explore new technology-\nactivity systems including interacting with images and informal science learning. Our \nexperience with FTW shows that it is a cost-effective collaborative design method, as it \nrequires inexpensive tools and resources, and minimal participant training. While it does not \npresume fixed patterns or contexts of use, it still yields engineerable outcomes that can \ndirectly inform design. The FTW provides a framework for creativity that is focused on \nrelating people with technology, by emphasising the envisioned socio-technical systems \nrather than technology. \n \nMany well-established design methods are grounded in an analysis of current everyday \nactivity in learning and\/or work settings. These will continue to be relevant and useful for \nimproving existing practices with technology, but are not appropriate for developing radically \nnew or disruptive devices that overturn current technologies (Bower & Christensen, 1995). \nNor are they suited to envisioning how people might learn, work or play together in a future \nVavoula & Sharples \n \n    \n 26 \nof pervasive computing. The FTW provides one way for exploring and designing such \nfutures. The next steps for FTW and similar methods will be also to provide the means for \nfurther challenging those futures, by subjecting them to a cycle of refinement and reinvention. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to Chris Baber, Josie Taylor, Patrick McAndrew, Peter Lonsdale and Daisy \nMwanza for useful feedback and comments on the FTW.
