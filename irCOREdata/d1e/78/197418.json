The aftermath of this process\nmay have been seen several times over the past two decades in the form of sparsely sampled,\nslowly fading emission from distant galaxies8\u201314, but the onset of the stellar disruption event\nhas never before been observed. Here we report on observations of a bright X-ray flare from\nthe new extragalactic transient, Swift J164449.3+573451. This source increased in brightness\nin the X-ray band by a factor of at least 104 since 1990 and by a factor of at least 100 since\nearly 2010. Our optical and X-ray observations show that we have captured the onset of\nrelativistic jet activity from a supermassive black hole for the first time. A companion paper15\ncomes to similar conclusions based on radio observations. This event is likely due to the tidal\ndisruption of a star falling into a supermassive black hole, but the detailed behaviour differs\nfrom current theoretical models of tidal disruption events, showing new signatures associated\nwith the onset of the powerful jet.\nSwift J164449.3+573451 (hereafter Sw J1644+57) was discovered when it triggered the\nSwift16 Burst Alert Telescope17 (BAT) on 28 March 2011. Subsequent analysis of BAT data taken\nbefore the on-board trigger shows that the outburst was first detected on 25 March 2011 (Sup-\nplementary Figure 1). The Swift X-Ray Telescope18 (XRT) measured a source position19,20 of RA\n3\n(J2000): 16h 44m 49:92s, Dec (J2000): +57\u000e 350 00:600, with a 90% confidence error circle radius of\n1.4 arcseconds. Subsequent optical21 and radio15 observations showed that a variable radio source\nwas located at the centre of a galaxy within the XRT error circle. Optical spectroscopy21 measured\na redshift of 0.354, corresponding to a luminosity distance of 5:8\u0002 1027 cm.\nWe performed broad-band followup observations using \r-ray, X-ray, UV, optical, and near-\nIR (NIR) telescopes. The flares seen by the BAT are closely tracked with better sensitivity in the\n0.3-10 keV band by the XRT (Figure 1). The X-ray light curve is complex and highly variable, with\npeak isotropic luminosities exceeding 1048 erg s\u00001 (Figure 2), implying accretion onto a compact\nobject. The integrated isotropic X-ray power (over the 50 days following the first BAT trigger) is\n\u0018 2 \u0002 1053 erg (1\u201310 keV). We have found no statistically significant periodic or quasi-periodic\nsignals in the XRT data. Details of our observations and data analysis are given in Supplementary\nInformation section 1.\nSw J1644+57 has not been previously detected at any wavelength and is not present in any\nsky catalogs. X-ray flux upper limits from observations by ROSAT, XMM-Newton, MAXI, and Swift\nbetween 1990 and 24 March 2011 are 2\u20134 orders of magnitude lower than the peak X-ray fluxes\nmeasured by Swift (Figure 2), and the ROSAT upper limits are an order of magnitude below the\nlowest flux in the first 50 days after the first BAT trigger.\nSw J1644+57 is unlike any previously discovered extragalactic X-ray transient. Gamma-\nray bursts reach similar peak fluxes and luminosities, but fade much more rapidly and smoothly\nthan Sw J1644+57. The broad class of AGNs cover the range of luminosities that we measured\n4\nfor Sw J1644+57 (3 \u0002 1045 to 3 \u0002 1048 erg s\u00001), but no individual AGN has been observed to\nvary by more than about two orders of magnitude. Supernovae have much lower luminosities\n(Lx < 3\u0002 1041 erg s\u00001). Some Galactic transients (such as Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients) vary\nby similar amounts22, but their luminosities are 10 orders of magnitude lower than Sw J1644+57.\nThis source appears to be without precedent in its high energy properties.\nOur X-ray and NIR observations provide limits on the mass of the accreting black hole.\nThe most rapid observed variability is a 3\u001b doubling in X-ray brightness over a time scale of\n\u000etobs \u0018 100 s. This constrains the size of the black hole under the assumption that the central\nengine dominates the variability. For a Schwarzschild black hole with mass Mbh and radius rs,\nthe minimum variability time scale in its rest frame is \u000etmin \u0018 rs=c \u0018 10:0(M6) s, where M6 \u0011\n(Mbh=10\n6 M\f). At z = 0:354, this gives\nMbh \u0018 7:4\u0002 106\n\u0012\n\u000etobs\n100 s\n\u0013\nM\f : (1)\nMuch smaller masses are unlikely, as they would lead to shorter timescale variability. However,\nshort time-scale variability can also be produced in a jet with substructure, in which case this\nconstraint may underestimate the black hole mass. We obtain an independent constraint on the\nblack hole mass from theMbh \u0000 Lbulge relation, which gives an upper limit of \u0018 2\u0002 107 M\f (see\nSupplementary Information section 2.1 for details). We conclude that the black hole mass is likely\nin the range 1 < M6 < 20.\nFor a black hole of this size, the peak isotropic X-ray luminosity exceeds the Eddington lu-\nminosity, LEdd = 1:3\u00021044 M6 erg s\u00001, by several orders of magnitude. If the radiation were truly\n5\nisotropic, radiation pressure would halt accretion and the source would turn off. This contradiction\nprovides strong evidence that the radiation pattern must be highly anisotropic, with a relativistic\njet pointed towards us.\nIn addition to the X-ray observations discussed above, we obtained photometry in the uvw2,\nuvm2, uvw1, u, b, v, R, J, H, and Ks bands with the Swift UVOT, LOAO, BOAO, TNG, UKIRT,\nCFHT, and Maidanak Observatory telescopes (Supplementary Figure 5). We used our broad-band\ndata set to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at several key time periods in order to\nconstrain models of the emission mechanism (Figure 3). The SEDs show that the broad-band\nenergy spectrum is dominated by the X-ray band, which accounts for 50% of the total bolometric\nenergy output in the high\/flaring X-ray state. The optical counterpart of the transient X-ray source\nis not detected in optical or UV bands, but is detected strongly in the NIR, indicating substantial\nextinction by dust in the host galaxy. We measure an extinction of AV \u0018 4:5 (Supplementary\nInformation section 1.2.3), which corresponds to a neutral hydrogen column density of NH \u0018\n1\u00021022 cm\u00002 for the Galactic ISM gas-to-dust ratio23; this is in rough agreement with the measured\nintrinsic X-ray absorption (Supplementary Figure 11).\nThe SED constrains the possible emission mechanism. We assume that the NIR and X-ray\nphotons originate in the same emission region, an assumption that is consistent with the NIR and\nX-ray spectral slopes. The optical-to-X-ray slope then requires a magnetically-dominated, particle-\nstarved jet. Although not shown here, we interpret the radio emission15 as an external shock\nin the gas surrounding Sw J1644+57. Details of our modeling are given in the Supplementary\n6\nInformation sections 2.3 \u2013 2.7.\nThis luminous, relativistic jet is likely powered by the tidal disruption of a star, which can ex-\nplain the increase by four orders of magnitude in the X-ray flux from this supermassive black hole,\nthe slow decay in flux following the initial outbursts, and the inferred mass accretion amounting to\na substantial fraction of a solar mass (Supplementary Information section 2.2). It is not surprising\nfor such an event to produce an X-ray jet6,24. If the accretion is powered by the tidal disruption of\na star, we can estimate the jet beaming factor based on the expected statistics of tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs). The Swift BAT, with a field of view of \u0018 4\u0019=7 sr and a duty cycle of \u0018 75%, has\ndetected one such event in \u0018 6 years at a peak flux that would have been detectable to z \u0018 0:8.\nThe all-sky rate of Sw J1644+57-like events is therefore R4\u0019 \u0018 1 yr\u00001, with a 90% confidence\ninterval25 of 0:08\u0000 3:9 yr\u00001. Taking into account the volume rate of TDEs and the galaxy number\ndensity, and assuming that \u0018 10% of TDEs produce relativistic jets, we estimate that the fraction\nof TDEs with jets pointed towards us must be \u0018 10\u00003 (Supplementary Information section 2.9.1;\na similar conclusion was obtained by the companion paper15). This jet solid angle can be achieved\nby a bulk Lorentz factor of \u0000 \u0018 10\u0000 20 or a jet opening angle of \u0012j \u0018 5\u000e.\nOur observations of Sw J1644+57 provide a unique data set for studying the onset of jet\nactivity from a supermassive black hole, and are consistent with a prediction that a low-density,\nmagnetically-dominated jet might be formed during the super-Eddington phase of a tidal disruption\nevent6. However, little theoretical work has been published discussing observational signatures of\nthe onset of such a jet. Instead, tidal disruption models have concentrated on emission from the\n7\nstellar surface, the accretion disk, and the surrounding medium: an X-ray or \r-ray thermal flare is\nexpected from the surface of the star as it is crushed by the strong gravitational gradient of the black\nhole5,7, with peak luminosity of< 1044 erg s\u00001 and a duration of tens of seconds; a phase of super-\nEddington accretion of bound debris, accompanied by a wind that interacts with the surrounding\nmedium6,26, will radiate in the UV\u2013NIR6 or X-ray26 bands with luminosity . 1044 erg s\u00001; and\nat late times the bolometric luminosity from the accretion disk may undergo a steady decline that\ntraces the rate of return of post-disruption debris2,27, 28, with _M \/ (t\u0000t0)\u00005=3. Detailed multi-band\nlight curve models of emission from the accretion disk in TDEs suggest that the X-ray emission\nshould be characterized by a broad, smooth X-ray lightcurve peaking at Lx \u0018 3 \u0002 1044 erg s\u00001\nweeks to months after the stellar disruption for a 106\u0000107 M\f black hole26, in sharp contrast to our\nobservations. The dramatic differences between these model predictions and our observations are\nlikely due to the bright jet in Sw J1644+57, which dominates the much fainter emission from the\nwind and disk. Long-term monitoring of Sw J1644+57 will help to distinguish between competing\nmodels of this event, and will show whether emission from the jet follows the expected t\u00005=3 decay\nof the mass accretion rate from fallback of stellar debris.\n1.

The horizontal axis is time in\ndays since the first BAT on-board trigger on 28 March 2011. The BAT and XRT count rates\ntrack each other closely, with episodes of bright flaring (up to 200 mCrabs in the BAT) in\nthe first few days after the first BAT trigger on 28 March 2011. The source brightness then\ndropped dramatically, with an average BAT count rate of 0:0020\u0006 0:0005 counts cm\u00002 s\u00001\nbetween 2 April 2011 and 18 April 2011. Data gaps are caused by times when the source\nwas not being observed. Error bars are one standard deviation.\nFigure 2 Swift XRT light curve of Sw J1644+57 for the first 7 weeks of observa-\ntions. a) Historical 3\u001b X-ray flux upper limits from the direction of Sw J1644+57, obtained\nby sky monitors and serendipitous observations over the last 20 years. The time axis for\nthis panel is in years before the BAT on-board trigger on 28 March 2011. The horizontal\nbars on each upper limit indicate the time interval over which they were calculated, and\nare placed at the value of the 3\u001b upper limit. All flux limits are calculated for the 1\u201310 keV\nband. (The BAT upper limit measured in its native energy band is about 3 orders of mag-\nnitude lower than the peak flux measured by the BAT during the early flares). b) XRT light\ncurve in the 1\u201310 keV band. The X-ray events were summed into time bins containing\n200 counts per bin and count rates were calculated for each time bin. Time-dependent\nspectral fits were used to convert count rates to absorption-corrected fluxes in the 1\u201310\nkeV band. The right-hand axis gives the conversion to luminosity of the source, assum-\ning isotropic radiation and using H0 = 71 km s\u00001, \nm = 0:27, and \n\u0003 = 0:73. Following\n14\nnearly 3 days of intense flaring with peak fluxes over 10\u00009 erg cm\u00002 s\u00001 and isotropic lu-\nminosities of \u0018 1048 erg s\u00001, Sw J1644+57 decayed over several days to a flux of about\n5\u0002 10\u000011 erg cm\u00002 s\u00001, then rose rapidly to \u0018 2\u0002 10\u000010 erg cm\u00002 s\u00001 for about a week.\nIt has been gradually fading since. Details of the upper limits and XRT light curve are\ngiven in the Supplementary Information section 1. Vertical error bars are one standard\ndeviation. Time bin widths are smaller than the line width for the vertical error bars.\nFigure 3 The Spectral Energy Distribution of Sw J1644+57. The green data points\nare from the early bright flaring phase; cyan data points are from the low state at 4.5\ndays; black data points are from roughly 8 days after the first BAT trigger. The near-IR\n(NIR) fluxes were dereddened with AV = 4:5, and the X-ray data were corrected for ab-\nsorption by NH = 2\u0002 1022 cm\u00002. Upper limits from the Fermi LAT (2\u0002 1023 Hz) and from\nVERITAS29 (1026 Hz) are also shown. The red curve is a blazar jet model30 dominated\nby synchrotron emission, fit to the spectral energy distribution of the brightest flares. On\nthe low frequency side, the steep slope between the NIR and X-ray bands requires sup-\npression of low-energy electrons, which would otherwise overproduce the NIR flux. This\nrequires a particle-starved, magnetically-dominated jet. On the high frequency side, the\nLAT (95%) and VERITAS (99%) upper limits require that the self-Compton component (red\ndashed line) is suppressed by \r-\r pair production, which limits the bulk Lorentz factor in\nthe X-ray emitting region to be \u0000 . 20. The model includes a disk\/corona component from\nthe accretion disk (black dotted curve), but the flux is dominated at all frequencies by the\nsynchrotron component from the jet. The blue curve shows the corresponding model in\n15\nthe low X-ray flux state. The kink in the X-ray spectrum in the low and intermediate flux\nstates suggests that a possible additional component may be required; it would have to\nbe very narrow, and its origin is unclear. Further details, including model parameters and\ntwo alternative models, are presented in the Supplementary Information section 2.\n16\n\n\n\n"}
