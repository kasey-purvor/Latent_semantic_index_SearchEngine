These results, besides being of mathematical interest,\nhave made an impact on some engineering questions, notably the problem of\nconstructing good low-order models of a given linear system (see the tutorial papers\n[G2, Y3]). Because most engineering systems have several inputs and outputs, they\nare described by matrix-valued functions, and so generalizations of the results of\n[AAK] to such functions are needed. There have been many papers carrying out such\ngeneralizations, starting with [KL]. There are often significant new complications in\nthe matrix case: in particular, this is so for the question of uniqueness. Is the best\nt V. V. Peller's research was supported by an NSF grant in modern analysis.\n498 V. V. PELLER AND N. J. YOUNG\napproximation to a given matrix function G on T by an element QeH^ unique?\nHereH^y is the set of meromorphic matrix-valued functions on D, bounded on T and\nhaving at most k poles in D (a fuller definition is given below). For an affirmative\nanswer one needs a more refined criterion of optimality than the simple minimization\nof the 2v\u00b0\u00b0 norm. A natural approach is to take account of all the singular values of\nthe error function matrices G(z) \u2014 Q(z): this leads to the notion of superoptimality. In\n[PY1] we carried out a thorough investigation of superoptimal approximations for\nthe case & = 0 \u2014 that is, when G is to be approximated by a function Q bounded and\nanalytic in D (the Nehari problem). The key result is that the superoptimal\napproximant is indeed unique as long as G is expressible as the sum of a continuous\nfunction on T and a function bounded and analytic in D. Furthermore, we obtained\ndetailed structural information about the superoptimal error G \u2014 Q. Briefly this error\ncan be diagonalized by certain unitary-valued functions to give a diagonal matrix\nfunction whose diagonal entries each have constant modulus and negative winding\nnumber.\nFor applications to the problem of model reduction it is the case k > 0 which is\nimportant, and so the question naturally arises as to whether the uniqueness\nstatement remains valid when k > 0. A simple example shows that it does not, but\nS. Treil [T2] showed that uniqueness does hold subject to a simple condition on the\nHankel singular values of G. His method of proof is entirely different from that of\n[PY1]: he makes interesting and original use of matricial weighting functions, which\namounts to a kind of implicit diagonalization. His method is efficient for numerous\npurposes, but it is not clear how it can be used for the construction of the\nsuperoptimal approximant. The method of [PY1] proceeds via explicit diag-\nonalization and does yield an algorithm, as well as detailed structural information.\nIn this paper we extend our method to the case k > 0. We obtain a proof by\ndiagonalization of Treil's uniqueness result and a high level algorithm for the\nconstruction of the superoptimal approximant. We also obtain a parametrization of\nall optimal solutions of the matrix Nehari\u2014Takagi problem which is of independent\ninterest.\nThe 'continuous time' analogues of the present results (relating to the\napproximation of functions on the imaginary axis by functions meromorphic in the\nright half plane) are given in [PY2].\n1. The superoptimal Nehari\u2014Takagi problem\nThe problem of finding QeH^ which is closest to a given L00 function G on the unit\ncircle with respect to the Z\u00b0\u00b0-norm is sometimes called the Nehari-Takagi problem\n[BGR]. For matrix functions there is typically a high degree of non-uniqueness in\nthe solution, and the question arises as to whether there is a natural way of selecting\na 'very best' approximation. One idea is the superoptimal approximation, which is\neasily grasped with the aid of the following example. Let\nI t is easy to calculate with the aid of the familiar scalar theory of the Nehari\u2014Takagi\nproblem (see, for example, [AAK] or [Y, chapter 16]) that the best approximation\nSuperoptimal approximation by meromorphic functions 499\nto g with respect to the L00 norm by functions with at most a single pole in the open\nunit disc is the zero function. Now let\nThen the distance from G to H^ is 1, and this distance is attained at every element\nof the form\nwith any q e H^ of norm no greater than 1. Thus there is a whole \u00a3\u00b0\u00b0 ball of optimal\nsolutions to the present approximation problem. The most natural of these to pick\nis the one for which q = 0, and one might ask for a modification of the optimality\ncondition which would select this solution. One way to achieve this aim is to ask for\nthe Q among the optimal approximants which minimizes\ndef\ns?(G-Q) = esssups1(G-g)(2)\nsince sf(G-Q) = \\\\q\\\\x\nas long as the right-hand side is no greater than 1. This quantity is minimized\nuniquely when q = 0.\nLet us now formalize the above notions. We write Mm< n for the space of complex\nm x n matrices with the usual operator norm (the largest singular value). We denote\nby L\"\" the space of essentially bounded matrix functions on the unit circle with\nessential supremum norm (when we need to emphasize that the functions are of type\nmxnwe write Lco(Mm _\u201e)). Thus, for GeL\u00b0\u00b0(Mmn),\n\\\\G\\\\J=fmavv\\\\G(z)\\\\.\nHw (or Hco(Mm \u201e)) denotes the space of bounded analytic matrix functions in the\nopen unit disc, with supremum norm. By Fatou's theorem, Hm(Mmrn) can be\nisometrically identified with a subspace of Lco(Mm n). We denote by H^)(Mmn) or\nsimply Hfi.) the subset of Lco(ifm n) consisting of functions essentially bounded on the\nunit circle, meromorphic on the open unit disc and having at most k poles there.\nThese poles are counted as follows. A finite Blaschke\u2014Potapov product of degree k is\na function of the form\n= U\no\nz \u2014 a. 0\n0 im-A\nz \u2014 a9\nIJ1 \\\\\u2014a2z\nY 0 \/\n0 r z \u2014 a\nm \u2014 1 .\nk\ni-akz\n0\nk\n0\nuk,\nwhere m e N, \\a}\\ < 1, 1 ^  j ^ k, and U} is a constant mxm unitary matrix, 0 < j ^ k.\nWe say that GeL\u2122 of type m x n has at most k poles in the open unit disc if G is\nexpressible on T in the form\nG = O\"1^\nfor some FeHx(Mm n) and some Blaschke-Potapov product O of degree k. We\n500 V. V. PELLER AND N. J. YOUNG\ndenote by C the space of continuous matrix functions on the unit circle. The singular\nvalues of a matrix A are denoted by\nand for GeL\u2122 we write\ndef\nsf(G) = ess sup s}(G(z)),\ndef\nOf course the first term of this sequence is \\\\G\\\\X, and if G is of type m x n then at most\nthe first min(m,n) terms can be non-zero. We shall say that Q is a superoptimal\napproximation to G in \/ \/ ^ if Q is an element of Hfy at which the sequence sco((r \u2014 Q)\nattains its minimum with respect to the lexicographic ordering.\nH \u2122 + C is the space of matrix functions on the unit circle expressible in the form\nF + G with FeH^^eC. It was shown in [PY1] that if GeHx + C then there is a\nunique superoptimal approximation to G in H$); and it is natural to hope that the\nsame will be true for \/\/(\u00b0\u00a3} with positive k. I t was claimed in [Y2] that this conclusion\ndoes hold in the case of rational G, but the following example shows it is not true.\nLet\nG(z) =\n-1\nz\n0\no\"\n1\n2 -\nThen the lexicographic minimum of sx(G \u2014 Q) over\nminimum is attained for either of the Hfo functions\nis (1,0,0,...), and this\n'o o\nl\no -2 J\nQ2(z) = 0\n(or indeed for any function P\/z with P a rank one orthogonal projection on C2).\nHowever the conclusion does follow \\isk{HG) < sk_1{HG), as was shown by Treil[T2].\nWe give an alternative proof using the diagonalization method of [PY1].\nThe starting point of most studies of the Nehari-Takagi problem is the theorem of\nAdamyan, Arov and Krein which relates best\/\/(\") approximations to singular values\nand vectors of Hankel operators. Let H2(Cn) denote the Hardy space of C\"-valued\nfunctions on the circle (see [He]). Corresponding to the given G we define the Hankel\noperator\nHH2(Cn)(H2(Cm))1\nHGx = P_(Gx),\nP_:L2(Cm)-+(H2(Cm))L\nby\nwhere\nis the orthogonal projection operator. For GeH^ + C, HG is a compact operator.\nThere is a matrix version of the theorem of Adamyan, Arov and Krein (see [Tl])\nwhich tells us that\ninf \\\\G-Q\\\\x = sk{HG), (1)\nthe &th singular value or s-number of HG. The following simple fact is folklore.\nSuperoptimal approximation by meromorphic functions 501\nLEMMA 1. If GeH^ then HG has rank at most k.\nProof. We have G = <t>*F for some Blaschke-Potapov product O of degree k and\nFeH\u2122. Forareftf2)1,\nfrom which it is clear that kerH\u00a3 r> <t>*(H2)L and hence that the co-kernel of # * is\ncontained in the fc-dimensional space (H2)1 Q<t>*(H2)L. Thus R% has rank ^ k.\nLEMMA 2. Let <j>beannx 1 inner function. There exists a co-outer n x (n\u2014 1) function\n<j>c such that\ndef\nunitary-valued, and all minors on the first column of O belong to\nHere a function (peH\"3 is inner if ^ (z) is an isometry (i.e. 0(z)*0(z) is the identity)\nfor almost all zeJ. A function FeHco(Mm \u201e) is outer ifFH2(Cn) is dense in H2(Cm).\nF is co-outer if .FT, the transpose of F, is outer. A minor of <t> is the determinant of a\nsquare submatrix of <t>; if the submatrix corresponds to rows ilt...,ip and columns,\nj x , . . . ,jp where j1 = 1 then the minor is said to be on the first column of O.\nFor the proof see [PY, theorem 1-1]. At first sight the class of such <1> looks less\nnatural than the class of inner functions. However, it seems to be essential to use such\nfunctions to obtain superoptimality results in the desired generality. There are\nmoreover unexpected other benefits, notably a simplification of the diagonalization\nprocess.\nTHEOREM 1. Let GeH\u2122 + C be an mxn matrix function and let k be a non-negative\ninteger. If either k = 0 or sk(HG) < S^^HQ) then there is a unique QeH^)(Mm n) such\nthat s\u2122(G \u2014 Q) is a minimum with respect to the lexicographic ordering. For this Q the\nsingular values\nSj(G(z)-Q(z))\nare constant a.e. on the unit circle for each j ^ 0.\nProof. Consider any QeH^ which is at minimal distance from G. From (1),\ndet\nIf sk = 0 then the rank of HG is at most k and hence GeHfij.y Thus the only Q which\nminimizes \\\\G \u2014 Q\\\\m is G itself, and so the theorem holds in this case. Now\nassume slc>0. Let veH2 be a unit singular vector of HG corresponding to sk. We\nclaim that\n(G-Q)v=HGv.\nIn the case k \u2014 0 this was established in [AAK]. Consider the case k > 0. Since HQ\nhas rank at most k, by Lemma 1, it follows from the definition of singular value that\nOn the other hand,\n502 V. V. PELLER AND N. J. YOUNG\nand so \\\\HG-Q\\\\ = sk.\nWe can thus apply the following elementary observation (see [P, theorem 6-14]).\nLEMMA 3. Let T be a bounded linear operator on Hilbert space and let k be a positive\ninteger. Suppose that sk_1(T) > sk(T) and that R is an operator of rank at most k such that\n\\\\T\u2014R\\\\ = sk(T). Then every singular vector of Tcorresponding to sk(T) is a maximizing\nvector of T\u2014R and is in keri?.\nIt follows that v is a maximizing vector of HG_Q, and so\n\u00ab* = \\WG-Q\\\\ = \\\\HG-Qv\\\\ = \\\\P_(G-Q)v\\\\ < \\\\(O-Q)v\\\\ ^ \\\\G-Q\\\\J\\v\\\\ = sk.\nEquality holds throughout, and so\n\\\\P-{Q-Q)v\\\\ = \\\\(G-Q)v\\\\,\nwhence (G-Q)v = P_{G-Q)v = HG_Q v = HGv,\nand our claim is established.\nWe wish to use v to block-diagonalize G \u2014 Q.

Then\nhCl = hWX = AX + yZXeH\u2122.\nThus yZXeH\u2122, and since y is co-outer it follows that ZXeH\u2122 and so that\nNow multiply both sides of condition (ii') by the scalar inner function detcD to see\nthat it is equivalent to xT{h1\u2014h) = 0 where x = (adj <P)Tw;i. To apply Lemma 5 we\nneed an inner co-outer function y of type m x (m\u2014 1) such that [x y] is unitary-\nvalued.

Construction of superoptimal approximants\nThe question arises as to whether the above proof shows how to construct a\nsuperoptimal approximation Q to a given G.

Parametrization of solutions of a Nehari-Takagi problem\nAlthough we are primarily concerned with the superoptimal Nehari\u2014Takagi\nproblem, the calculations carried out in the proof of Theorem 1 yield a result of\ninterest for the usual 'optimal' Nehari\u2014Takagi problem.

(19)\nIndeed, K, A, O, W, a, y and G1 may be chosen as in the Algorithm above.\nProof. This is just a repetition of part of the proof of Theorem 1. We retain the\nnotation of that proof.
