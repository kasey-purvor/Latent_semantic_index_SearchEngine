These mutinies were transgressive acts that reveal much about convict journeys \ninto transportation: the limitations of colonial regulation of convict vessels, conditions on \nboard ship, and the alliances forged between convicts and crew. They also reveal the \nmulti-dimensional nature of the convict middle passage, and dispel simplistic notions of \nsingle convict identities and experiences.  \n \n 3 \nIntroduction: Indian penal settlements \nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century Indian convict ships zigzagged across the \nIndian Ocean in all directions, an important part of what has been conceptualised usefully \nelsewhere as a global system of convict migration.2 The East India Company established \nits first penal settlement for the reception of Indian convicts in Benkulu (1787-1825). The \nAndaman Islands (1793-6), Penang, otherwise known as Prince of Wales Island (1790-\n1860), Melaka and Singapore (1825-60), and the Burmese provinces of Arakan and \nTenasserim (1828-62) followed soon afterwards.3 In addition, one-time lieutenant-\ngovernor of Penang, R.T. Farquhar, lobbied successfully for convicts to be sent to the \nBritish colony Mauritius when he assumed governorship of the island in 1815.4 The \nBritish judicial authorities in the Straits Settlements (as Penang, Melaka and Singapore \nwere known after 1825) and the Burmese provinces also used the punishment of \ntransportation, and during the same period shipped a small number of offenders to \nmainland jails across India. They formed a sizeable prisoner minority in one of India\u2019s \nlargest jails, Alipur, near Calcutta, as well as in smaller district jails across the Bombay \nand Madras presidencies. Transportation emptied overcrowded mainland prisons and \nassured new Company settlements a supply of cheap labour. As I have argued elsewhere, \nthe convict workforce was vital to the development of early colonial infrastructure.5\nAs many as six transportation ships left from each of the Bengal, Bombay and \nMadras Presidencies each year, and about the same number brought convicts from the \nStraits Settlements and Burma to mainland jails. The number of convicts on board was \nwidely variable, from less than a dozen to more than 200. Given the long duration of \nthese early penal settlements, the organization of transportation across three presidencies \n \n 4 \n(and three Company departments \u2013 judicial, military and marine), compounded with the \nproblem of missing shipping records and convict returns, the total convict traffic of the \nIndian Ocean is extremely difficult to quantify. Based on a close reading of convict ship \nindents drawn up in the three presidencies, my best estimates are as follows.6 The \nCompany shipped just over 2,000 convicts to Benkulu in the period to 1825. It then \ntransported at least 300 Bengal Presidency convicts to its first abortive Andaman Islands \nsettlement. Most were from Bengal. Madras only sent convicts for a brief period (1820-\n24), and Bombay sent none at all. A relatively small number of convicts were shipped to \nMauritius \u2013 about 1,500 \u2013 from Bengal and Bombay between 1815 and 1837. In 1825 the \nremaining Benkulu convicts were transferred to Penang, which was already a penal \nsettlement. Stephen Nicholas and Peter R. Shergold have estimated that the Straits \nSettlements together received on average 200 arrivals per year from the three \npresidencies, making a grand total of 15,000 convicts.7 I think that this is probably an \nunderestimate: one contemporary report stated that Singapore alone had received 16,000 \nconvicts by 1858.8 The Bengal and Madras authorities also transported at least 5,000 and \nperhaps as many as 7,000 convicts to the Burmese Provinces after 1828. These figures do \nnot include convicts transported from Ceylon to Southeast Asia. According to Nicholas \nand Shergold they numbered approximately 1-1,500.9\nIn the eyes of many East India Company officials, the sea was central to how \nconvicts experienced the punishment of transportation, for crossing the kala pani, or \n Again based on shipping records, I \nestimate that the authorities also incarcerated between 1,000 and 2,000 Southeast Asian \ntransportation convicts in Indian mainland prisons during the course of the nineteenth \ncentury. \n 5 \nblack water, resulted in a loss of caste. Thus Indians particularly feared it. Convict \nresponses to transportation were rather more nuanced than this interpretation suggests.10 \nNevertheless, the cultural dynamics of overseas transportation remain a good starting \npoint for an article that seeks to explore some of the complexities of what we might refer \nto as the convict middle passage. I want to look at the interplay between the Company\u2019s \norganisation of convict transportation and convicts\u2019 own experiences of life on board \nship, for this potentially troublesome cargo played a formative role in how the traffic was \nregulated and played out. Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker borrow the term \n\u2018hydrarchy\u2019 to think about early-modern ships as both engines of capitalism and spaces \nof resistance.11\nI shall begin with a discussion of the regulation of convict transportation in the \nIndian Ocean during the period to 1860. By then the authorities shipped all Indian and \nsome Burmese convicts to the Andaman Islands, which had been re-established as a penal \ncolony in the wake of the uprisings that swept across India in 1857-8.\n Two centuries later, and colonial expansion and convict agency were so \nclosely intertwined that it is sometimes difficult to know where one ended and the other \nbegan. \n12 India remained \nthe destination for some convicts from Burma and all those from the Straits Settlements. I \nwill then move on to my second theme: convict unrest at sea. During the first half of the \nnineteenth century violent disorder broke out on 12 convict ships travelling to and from \nIndia and Southeast Asia, together with two carrying convicts inland to Calcutta for \ntransportation. Mutiny plots were discovered and foiled on three more. (Table 1). Those \nvessels that experienced convict insurrection were a small proportion of the total; \nnowhere near the ten per cent of Atlantic slave ship passages that Stephen D. Behrendt, \n 6 \nDavid Eltis and David Richardson have estimated ended in uprising.13 Their relative \nrarity over a comparatively short period of time makes the sort of econometric analysis \nattempted by Behrendt, Eltis and Richardson impossible. Unlike the slave trade (a system \nof private trade), however, convict transportation was regulated publicly (by the \nCompany). Unlike for many slave ships where unrest was covered up, disorder of any \nkind therefore created voluminous records in the form of extensive colonial enquiries, \nlegal proceedings and newspaper reports. In this sense, the records on convict \ntransportation share much with those on the passage of Indian indentured labourers, about \nwhom we know relatively little.14 In recent years historians have rethought the meaning \nof the slave middle passage, interpreting it as a space of creative resistance. The \nlimitations of the slave ship archive make detailed analyses problematic, however.15\nStrictly speaking, unrest on board convict ships was not \u2018mutiny\u2019, for convicts \nwere not soldiers or sailors responding to superior officers. However, contemporaries \ndescribed it as such because convicts tried or succeeded in overthrowing the captain and \ncrew whilst they were at sea.\n The \ntype of qualitative evidence produced as a result of convict revolts on the other hand \nallows us to attempt a convict-centred analysis of ship insurrection more difficult for the \nenslaved. It is also a useful means of looking at what we might conceptualise as the \nempty archival space of everyday life on board the convict ship. \n16 For this reason, I will refer to their acts as mutinies too. \nAs Cornelius J. Lammers has noted, getting to grips with mutiny is \u2018a tricky business\u2019. \nCollective actions had multiple goals that changed over time and were potentially \nredefined quite differently by the authorities at a later stage.17 Yet convict mutinies do \nshare certain features.18 I will consider why they occurred, and how convicts were able to \n 7 \ntake control of ships. I will then look at colonial responses to these dramatic events, \nshowing how congratulatory notes in the press about the firm actions of ships\u2019 crews \nmasked deeper divisions about how to deal with the issue of authority at sea.19\n \n Lastly, \nconvict mutinies provide a window on some of the intricacies of the broader social and \npolitical order during the first half of the nineteenth century. I want to unpeel some of \ntheir onion layers to suggest that convict disorder was riddled with fractures and alliances \nbased on loosely defined social affiliations. I will argue that mutinies show how blurred \nthe boundaries between the seemingly diametrically opposed spaces of colonial officers \nand Indian convicts were. I also want to demonstrate that in these worlds turned upside \ndown convict authority structures were strongly mimetic rather than entirely anti-colonial \nin nature.  \nRegulating convict transportation in the Indian Ocean \nThe regulation of Indian convict transportation during the first half of the nineteenth \ncentury can be divided into two periods. Before 1834 the East India Company had a \nmonopoly over long distance trade routes, and regularly shipped Indian convicts to \nSoutheast Asia on its Chinese fleet \u2013 the \u2018China ships\u2019. Those same ships brought \nconvicts back from Southeast Asia to mainland Indian jails. The presence of a medical \nattendant, the large number of crew and arms and the \u2018regularity of discipline\u2019 meant that \nthere were never any convict uprisings on board. During this period, if there were no \nCompany ships available, the local authorities invited tenders for the transportation of \nconvicts on private trading vessels also - ships that were permitted by the terms of the \nCompany\u2019s charter to work shorter passages in the region. After 1834, when the \n 8 \nCompany lost its monopoly, most convicts were transported on such ships and \narrangements became somewhat piecemeal and irregular. In general, this lack of \nregulation only came to light after some incident at sea.  \nAfter the convicts of the Catherine attempted to take the ship on the way to the \nStraits Settlements (1838), for instance, it emerged that there were no rules for the \nregulation of transportation.20 The Bombay Courier much regretted the \u2018blundering\u2019 of \nthe authorities in this respect.21 Rules were set shortly afterwards.22 At the same time the \nratio of crew to convicts was fixed in a way that reflected colonial suspicions about the \npotential alliances formed between fellow countrymen. Three convicts were equal to one \nEuropean sailor, and one convict equal to one native seaman, though it was said that this \nrule might be relaxed when vessels sailed clear of the coast and there were no convict \nseafarers on board.23\nThe first memorandum for ships sailing in the other direction - from the Straits \nSettlements to the Indian mainland - was only issued in 1844, after a convict uprising on \nthe Harriet Scott. The ship had been carrying convicts from Penang to Bombay. A group \nof convicts killed captain Philip Benyon; seven of them escaped. Subsequently, \ncommanders were reminded not to trust convicts, and to examine them carefully to make \nsure they had nothing with which they could cut their fetters. Their irons were to be \nchecked twice a day.\n A year later a more serious mutiny broke out on the Virginia. A \ngroup of convicts sailing from Bombay to Singapore murdered Captain Charles Whiffen, \ntook over the ship and escaped inland south of Goa. The colonial authorities accused the \nship\u2019s officers of not following the Catherine rules.  \n24 As late as 1859, however, there was still neither a fixed rations \nscale nor basic rules for medical procedures for convict ships sailing out of Southeast \n 9 \nAsia.25 David Richardson puts the incidence of slave shipboard revolts down to such \nweaknesses in ships\u2019 managerial regimes.26\nThe procedure for obtaining a ship and embarking convicts on it varied across the \npresidencies. In Bengal, the superintendent of Alipur Jail wrote to the secretary to \ngovernment in the judicial department when there were convicts awaiting transportation. \nThis letter was then sent to the superintendent of marine, who was asked to procure a \npassage for the convicts. He then found a Company vessel or put out for tender, inspected \nthe ship to make sure it was suitable, and reported back to the judicial department. The \nsuperintendent at Alipur was informed, and told to have the convicts ready at a certain \ntime. The military board was then instructed to ship provisions for the convicts, which it \ndid through the commissariat department. Finally, the military department provided a \nguard, if it was seen as necessary.\n These failings were also critical for convict \nvessels. Without exception, convict revolts took place on private trading ships; all but one \nsailing in the years following the abolition of the Company\u2019s charter. \n27 In Bombay, the superintendent of the Indian navy \nmade the arrangements through direct consultation with the session judge in charge of the \nconvict holding jail at Tannah. He was also responsible for checking that the vessels were \nseaworthy and that the convicts were properly lodged and secured. It was the master of \neach ship\u2019s responsibility to apply for a guard if he felt unsafe without one.28 In practice, \noften the government was unwilling to shoulder the additional cost of extra officers on \nboard. In July 1840, the Bombay government toyed briefly with the idea of chartering \nvessels twice a year, but rejected it on the grounds of cost. Instead it was agreed that \nhigher tenders would be accepted, in order to encourage \u2018respectable and capable ships\u2019 \nwith large crews to take convicts on board.29 Even after another mutiny on the Freak \n 10 \n(1841), when convicts under transportation from Bombay to Singapore murdered captain \nT.J. Suffield and escaped near Aceh (northern Sumatra), the master of another convict \nvessel due to sail from Madras, the Resolution, requested a guard and was turned down. \nThe authorities in the presidency decided that in future it would send convicts on troop \nships only in order to cut costs.30\nThe cost of transportation depended on the availability of ships, the length of the \nvoyage and whether rations and water were supplied. Including the cost of provisions, \ntransportation from Bengal or Madras to Benkulu cost about 60 rupees per convict; to the \nStraits between 35 and 40 rupees; and, to the slightly nearer penal settlements in Burma \naround 30 rupees a head. The expense of transportation to Mauritius was around 60 to 75 \nrupees. Shipping links from Bombay were rather erratic, and because insurance offices \nexcluded claims arising from mutiny, often those ships with room to spare were not keen \nto take convicts on board.\n This probably explains why there were never any \nmutinies on board Madras convict ships during this period.  \n31 This was reflected in the cost of transportation from the port. \nFrom the early 1800s, the authorities complained about the shortage of ships and the high \ntender rates.32 Nothing had changed 40 years later. In 1843 the governor wrote of the \n\u2018exorbitant\u2019 prices being demanded.33 The relatively long voyage to Burma or the Straits \ncost about 75 to 80 rupees per convict. The cost of transporting convicts to Mauritius \nvaried from 50 to 100 rupees a head.34\nUnlike slave ships crossing the Atlantic, or transportation vessels sailing from \nBritain to Australia during the same period, Indian ships were not specially fitted out for \nconvicts. In general, on both Company and private vessels, convicts were accommodated \n Two-thirds of the money was paid to ship owners \non departure, and the remainder upon delivery of the convict cargo.  \n 11 \nbetween decks, with their provisions in the hold. They were side-by-side with other \ncargo, goods such as bales of cotton, reels of silk, fresh dates, chests of opium, rattan \ncanes, and sacks of betel nut. The space allotted to each convict was supposed to be six \nfeet by two, which the superintendent of the Indian navy in Bombay described at the time \nas \u2018about the same\u2019 as that allotted to native sailors and troops.35 Nevertheless, as we will \nsee Bengal ships had a much smaller specification (six by half a foot). Even according to \nthis extremely limited allowance not infrequently convict ships set sail in a grossly \novercrowded state. Moreover, in what was essentially a cost-cutting measure, it was not \nusual practice to send medical attendants on board. Only in exceptional cases were \n\u2018prisons\u2019 constructed, notably when thugs were transported to the Burmese provinces \nfrom the 1830s.36 The shipment of especially dangerous offenders or previously mutinous \nconvicts also required extra precautions. The resident councillor of Penang described the \nfitting out of the Sesostris in 1844 thus: \u2018A prison was constructed on the Tween Decks, \nin a place separated by a partition from that occupied by the seamen, but overlooked by \nmeans of 2 air holes. The prisoners were divided into 3 gangs; each gang had a chain \npassing through their irons. A guard was posted over them.\u201937 A prison was constructed \non the General Wood too (Hong Kong to the Straits, 1847), but it was destroyed to make \nroom for a large cargo of sugar just before the convicts were embarked. This was to have \ndisastrous consequences. The 92 convicts on board took over the ship, killed captain \nStokoe and some of the crew and fled.38\nIn response to the Virginia mutiny, and general astonishment that existing rules \nfor the guidance of ships\u2019 officers had not been followed, in 1841 the Bombay \ngovernment laid down new regulations. This lengthy set of instructions is worth quoting \n  \n 12 \nin full, for it shows that the authorities knew all too well what was likely both to \nprecipitate and make possible an uprising, convict grievances combined with slack \nmanagement: \n \n1. The whole of the guard shall be under arms every morning from day light til 8 \no\u2019clock a.m. during which time the convicts shall be allowed to come on deck by 20 at a \ntime for one hour; the same again in the evening for one hour. \n2. The whole of the guard shall be loaded with musket grape and a particular spot \nshall be marked out on the deck beyond which the convicts shall not move. \n3. Convicts are on no account to be made servants of. \n4. Convicts are on no account to have their irons taken off except in dangerous \nillness or even of the ship being in most imminent danger. \n5. All convicts to be ironed on both legs and on any mutinous or troublesome \nconduct to be double ironed. \n6. The days the convicts are not admitted on deck to be entered in the log with the \nreasons. \n7. All punishments amongst the convicts to be noted in the log. \n8. Complaints by convicts to be written into the logbook. Sick convicts to be \nremoved to the infirmary or hospital; death or escape to be entered into the log. \n9. Food to be served out according to table. \n10. The irons of the convicts to be examined by the ship\u2019s carpenter every morning \nwhen they come out on the deck for exercise. \n11. Opportunity to be given to the convicts to bathe themselves in salt water during \ntheir morning exercise. \n12. Handcuffs and leg irons spare to be sent with each convict ship. \n13. The place where the convicts are kept shall always have the trellised hatch down, \nand a sentry or sentries on duty over this day and night; a lamp shall if possible be so \nfixed on the deck against the mast as to reflect the light down into the prison house. \n14. If a Medical Officer be on board all the prisoners shall be minutely inspected once \na week. \n15. The main tops always to be furnished with a few firearms and spare ammunition, \nwater and biscuit and the crew or guard to be directed as a last resort to retreat there.39\n \n \nThe Bombay authorities also decided to transfer control of the embarkation of convicts \nfrom the navy to the superintendent of police, on the grounds that he would know more \nabout the sort of security necessary for each batch. When the Virginia convicts were \nembarked, no mention had been made of the fact that the convicts were of \u2018a more \n 13 \ndesperate character\u2019 than usual or that two of them \u2013 Siddee Almas and Abdul Kureem - \nwere sailors. No extra precautions had been taken.40 As we will see, in later years the \nVirginia rules were not always followed. As the secretary to the government of Bombay \nput it in 1841, if they had been a subsequent catastrophe on board the Freak would never \nhave occurred.41 The result was an underlining of the need to follow regulations to the \nletter, particularly in relation to the provision of a sufficient guard.42\n \n \nOn board the convict ship \nMarcus Rediker has written of the careful organization and division of labour on \neighteenth-century ships that, in his view, were at the centre of a sphere of circulation \nthat exploited labour capital.43 Convict ships too were remarkably hierarchical places, \nand despite the regulations prohibiting the employment of convicts, some were integrated \ninto life above decks.44 In this sense, convict experiences of the middle passage could \nvary widely. Ships\u2019 commanders chose convicts of diverse regional origin, social and \neconomic background and religion to work on board, on the basis of their social origins, \nskill base and previous good behaviour. A small number of convicts were employed as \nsweepers, cooks and overseers for and of their fellow transportees. There are hints in \nconvict ship logs that they may have been employed in the loading and unloading of \nprovisions and cargo too. Convicts were frequently embarked some days before ships left \nport; occasionally a few were \u2018kept back\u2019 by captains after arrival at their destination.45 \nUndoubtedly, this was a boon to ships\u2019 officers, but it could also prove their downfall, for \nemployment on board gave convicts the freedom to move around the ship. Unlike others, \noften these working convicts were not fettered. Loongh, the cook on the Harriet Scott \n 14 \nmoved around the ship to \u2018observe and devise the insurrection\u2019.46 Those of the Freak \napparently took the opportunity to unpadlock their fellow convicts\u2019 irons.47 Given that \ntwo of the convicts - Garoo bin Deojee and Puthia Vulud Meyia Saba - were being \nretransported after their escape from the Virginia, this was a serious miscalculation.48\nOn slave ships there was a gendered dimension to shipboard resistance. \nRichardson has shown how closely enslaved women were involved in slave ship revolts \nbecause, unlike men, they were rarely shackled.\n \n49 Though Indian women were not \nfettered either and they were sometimes allowed to remain on deck,50 they made up a \nmuch smaller proportion of the total number of convicts than did female slaves \u2013 ten per \ncent at the very most.51 The mutiny ships under discussion did carry small numbers of \nwomen, but beyond the fact that female convicts were lodged separately from men,52 we \nknow very little about their experiences on board. To what extent they engaged in sexual \nrelations \u2013 voluntary or otherwise \u2013 for instance is difficult to say.53 Though there is no \ndirect evidence, it is entirely feasible that they used their relative freedom to pass on \ninformation about the movements of crew or the whereabouts of weaponry to the men. \nThe authorities were quite aware of this possibility. In 1850, 39 transportation convicts en \nroute from Allahabad to Calcutta escaped from the Kaleegunga. A committee of inquiry \nwas set up, one of its lines of questioning being the role played by the convict women on \nboard. Commander John Stout told the committee that the women could not have \nreleased the men because the guards were \u2018too careful\u2019.54\nIt was poor management more generally that provided convicts with both the \nmotive and the opportunity to revolt. In relation to the former, regulations governing the \n Evidently they had not been \ncareful enough to prevent the escape of every single convict on board. \n 15 \namount of space allowed to convicts were on occasion ignored. Overcrowding was \nsometimes a problem in quarters where even according to the usual allowance convicts \nwould have been packed in like beans in a can. Mutiny on the Freak was partly put down \nto a breach in the rules on overcrowding (six extra convicts had been embarked), and the \ngovernor of Bombay warned the superintendent of police to follow rules more strictly in \nthe future.55 More dramatically, the Catherine (1838) took 60 convicts, almost double the \nnumber it had been certified to carry. The smell below deck was so disgusting that even \ncontemporary officials found it difficult to describe. Captain Frederick Pendygrass wrote \nlater that when he went down into the convict hold it was so filthy that had the ship \ncontinued on its voyage disease would have broken out. The acting senior magistrate of \npolice in Bombay was unable to find words to describe it. Several convicts sick with \nvenereal and other diseases had been embarked, and there was no medical attendant on \nboard.56\nLike other passengers and sometimes even the crew, convicts suffered from \ndebilitating seasickness, adding to their misery and desperation. In 1827, seven convicts \nsailing from Bombay to Mauritius on the Constance refused to go below decks, stating \nthat it was hot enough to kill them and that \u2018they would not go\u2019. They took over the ship \nand forced the crew to sail back to Kannur, on the southwest coast of India.\n The convicts\u2019 response was to resolve on murdering the captain and crew and \nescape, though they were discovered and taken back to Bombay before they could carry \nout their plot.  \n57 In 1849 the \nwife of Company judge Edward Benthall, Clementina, wrote of the \u2018rolling, pitching and \njogging\u2019 of the convict ship Enterprize sailing to Moulmein. The passengers were \u2018a \nmiserable set\u2019, and apparently even the captain felt ill.58 Several of the Virginia convicts \n 16 \nspoke of their sickness on board. They claimed that illness had left them unable to \nparticipate in mutinous acts.59\nAs we have seen, it was the responsibility of each ship\u2019s owners to supply the \nconvicts\u2019 rations, and provision for this was included in the per capita shipping rate. In an \nacknowledgement of caste Hindu cultural practices regarding sea voyages, there were \nsupposed to be two types of rations: the first for convicts who cooked on board ship, and \nthe second for convicts who did not. Those who ate cooked food received the same \nrations as lascars (sailors), that is rice, dhal and fish in addition to eating and smoking \ntobacco, betel nut, salt and basic condiments - ghee, tamarind, chillies, pepper, garlic and \nonions. Those who did not cook received the same tobacco, betel, salt and condiment \nrations, together with a ration of sugar, powa and parched gram in lieu of rice, dhal and \nfish.\n We will return to the theme of death rates at sea more \ngenerally in a moment. \n60 Two bottles of wine and two bottles of limejuice were also supposed to be issued \nfor every five convicts.61 Although supplies were in theory inspected before ships \ndeparted, evidence suggests that captains sometimes skimped on them, and provisions \neither ran short during the voyage or were of questionable quality. As Rediker shows, the \ndenial of crews\u2019 customary victuals was a familiar tactic for commanders generally when \nthey wanted to economise.62 Yet short rations proved an obvious spur to mutiny. During \nthe trial of the Virginia mutineers, several of the defendants claimed that their rations \nwere less substantial than the allowance they had received in jail. Their cross-\nexamination of the witnesses (for this was a right accorded to convicts appearing in court) \nattempted to show that they were \u2018starved and ill-treated\u2019.63 The convicts on the \n 17 \nSingapore Packet, who made an ill-fated attempt to seize the ship between Bombay and \nSingapore in 1841, also held that their provisions were \u2018bad\u2019.64\nDisease sometimes broke out on board transportation vessels. Though there is \nlittle evidence of a direct link between sickness and mutiny, fears about its spread \nundoubtedly fed into convict anxieties about poor conditions more generally. At the same \ntime, investigations into shipboard sickness reveal much about caste practices amongst at \nleast some Hindu convicts. In 1853, the Margaret Skelly shipped 164 convicts from \nBengal to Singapore. Six died of dysentery on the way.\n  \n65 Mortality rates in Indian jails \nwere appalling; during the first half of the nineteenth century, they sometimes peaked at \n25 per cent.66 However, as the weakest convicts often died while awaiting embarkation \nand sick convicts were normally detained in jail, it was unusual for convicts to die on \nboard transportation ships. Aboard 215 convict vessels sailing from Bengal between 1793 \nand 1848, for instance, there were just 25 deaths.67\nThe resident councillor of Singapore, F. Church, reported that many of the \nconvicts had disembarked \u2018in a very weak state\u2019. It seems that only 30 days\u2019 provisions \nhad been shipped, but the voyage had taken 42 days. He wrote that the convicts \ncomplained that their rations and allowance of water had been very limited.\n It is not clear what proportion of these \ndeaths was from disease (only three were specifically described as such), and what \nproportion was the result of accidental drowning, suicide or escape bids. Nevertheless, \nthe number of deaths on board ship was very small, so six deaths on a single journey was \nan extraordinarily high number. The governor of the Straits Settlements, W.J. \nButterworth, ordered an immediate enquiry.  \n68 The \ncommander of the native guard, subahdar Shaik Hyder, stated that in his opinion the \n 18 \nconvicts had not been rationed properly because the water ran short. This meant that \nconvicts did not have enough to drink and that their rice could not be cooked properly.69 \nIf we read between the archival lines, there was clearly a cultural dimension to all this \ntoo. Commander Alfred Pearce wrote in response to the allegations of short rations that \nthe convicts had thrown a good deal of cooked food overboard.70 Chief mate George \nHolland reported that the convicts were \u2018too lazy to cook\u2019 and would not take their \nrations. However, on closer analysis it seems that they only refused them at the end of the \nvoyage, when the non-cooking Hindu convicts\u2019 grain had run out and been substituted \nwith rice.71 Cultural norms made it impossible for many caste Hindus to take cooked \nfood whilst at sea.72 Despite their claims that the convicts were at fault, it seems that the \nMargaret Skelly\u2019s crew was all too aware of the religious dimension to their refusal to \neat, and its potentially violent consequences. According to the convicts, the crew threw \noverboard their lotahs.73 These were brass drinking vessels that prisoners had used with \ndevastating effect in the murder of the British superintendent of Alipur jail in 1834.74 The \nBengal authorities ruled that the provisions put on board were only one third of what was \nrequired for the journey. The payment of the balance money for the journey (a third of \nthe total) was therefore withheld.75\nThe issue of violation of caste is one that emerges regularly in other places in the \nconvict ship archive. It is clear that despite the dual rations system convicts\u2019 religious \nmores were not always respected. When the Freak convicts were put on trial one of them \nstated that a convict named Ethaljagajee had \u2018beat rice and sugar with grain as he would \nnot eat what was cooked\u2019. He had apparently complained to the captain; in response the \ncaptain had threatened to reduce his allowance altogether.\n \n76 Saduck Ali of the Virginia \n 19 \nmade a very similar claim during his trial, stating that the Hindu convicts on board could \nnot eat their rice ration. He added that the Hindus on board thought: \u2018Death was \npreferable, god was above and the sea below\u2019.77 Ascribing a specifically religious motive \nto other convicts who engaged in \u2018everyday\u2019, individual acts of resistance is more \nproblematic. On occasion, convicts committed suicide or leapt overboard in a bid to \nescape. British contemporaries put such actions down to their fear of crossing the \u2018black \nwaters\u2019. \u2018Draft rules for the management of transportation convicts proceeding to \nCalcutta\u2019 noted: \u2018it should be borne in mind that men meditating an escape are likely to \nbe the quietest and best behaved and that every one of them would rather die at once than \nencounter the mysterious horrors of the \u201ckalapanee\u201d\u2019.78 Yet such actions do not create the \nsort of convict-centred evidence we see for collective events, making it difficult to \nascertain motive. More usually, captains reported such losses without explanation, or \nnoted that they had \u2018no apparent cause\u2019.79\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s, several other convict vessels which had suffered \nhigh mortality rates came under scrutiny. In 1842, nine of the 49 convicts travelling to \nSingapore on board the Palinurus perished. Again, a committee was assembled to \ninvestigate. It pointed to the light winds that had prolonged the journey, reporting that the \nhigh mortality was not surprising given the convicts\u2019 previous long confinement, \u2018state of \nmind\u2019 and \u2018the entirely new position in which they were placed.\u2019\n  \n80 When nine of the 97 \nconvicts shipped on the Imam of Muscat died either on the way to Penang or shortly after \narrival in 1850, most of dysentery, the Bombay superintendent of convicts reported that \nthey had all been healthy on embarkation, and their sickness was in part due to the \njourney itself. There was a cultural element to it too, for it seems that at least four of the \n 20 \nconvicts had refused to take any food or medicine whilst on board.81 Though the captain \nhimself admitted that water and boiled rice ran short during the voyage of the Fattay \nSalam from Bombay to Penang in 1854, he stated that the convicts had refused to receive \nmore than a day\u2019s rations of onions at once, so he had stopped issuing them altogether.82\nSimilarly high mortality rates occurred amongst convicts transported to Singapore \non the Atlanta in April 1857. Of the 131 convicts embarked, 19 died on board, one on \nlanding and two others on their way to the convict lines. Two more died within a few \ndays, and two months later 40 were still in hospital.\n \n83 The convicts told the senior \nsurgeon that they had been allowed to wash only once during the voyage, their food \nallowance had been insufficient and they suffered much from water shortages. Despite \nhaving inspected convict ships for the past 12 years, the surgeon claimed that he had \n\u2018never witnessed so much misery, disease and wretchedness as existed amongst these \nmen\u2019. They had, he said, been packed into a poorly ventilated hold without regard to their \nhealth.84 Bengal\u2019s inspector-general of prisons, F.J. Mouat, headed an enquiry, which \nfound that although the convicts had been allowed the stipulated space (six by half a \nfoot), they could not lie down: \u2018to men suffering from fever diarrhoea and dysentery it \nneeds no description to realize the terrible distress they must have endured.\u2019. In future, he \nrecommended, transportation ships should allow convicts the same space as for \nindentured labourers (six feet by three). Mouat further concluded that shipboard sickness \nhad been exacerbated by convicts having hidden their illnesses before embarkation, \nthrough fear of being forced to take purgatives. The \u2018filthy state\u2019 of the convicts was also \na factor. The commander of the vessel told Mouat that he had made all the convicts bathe \nand wash their clothes and bedding once, but that it had excited such discontent that he \n 21 \ndecided not to repeat the exercise.85\nPoor conditions were sometimes in evidence on board vessels sailing out of the \nStraits Settlements too. Five of the 80 convicts shipped from the Straits to Bombay on the \nCity of Palaces (1858) died on the way, for instance, another high death rate. Nearly all \nwere suffering from scurvy on their arrival, and 16 were so weak they could not walk \nfrom the railway station to the jail.\n This was perhaps because convicts were issued with \nonly one set of clothes, and had nothing with which to cover themselves while they dried. \n86 The assistant sessions judge wrote of their \nemaciation, sickness and suffering.87 It seems that their food and water had run short \nduring the four-month voyage (25 days from Singapore to Penang, and three months from \nPenang to Bombay), and none of them were given any bedding. Some of the convicts \ndetermined to take over the ship. Mutiny was averted when one of the convicts - Allisha \nMadrassee - informed on the rest, and the captain chained all but eight together for the \nremainder of the journey. They were forced to eat, sleep and answer the call of nature in \nthe same place where they were made to sit.88 We will return to the shady figure of the \nconvict informer below. There was a further dimension to sickness on board these \nSoutheast Asian transportation ships, for many of the convicts were opium addicts. In \n1851, six of the 39 convicts embarked on the Paragon died.89 Havildar (sergeant) \nRamnae Dhurumnae stated that the convicts had told them that they needed the drug. \nCaptain William Wood Murch reported too that several convicts had told him that their \ncomrades died for want of the stimulant.90 In future, ships carrying convicts from \nSoutheast Asia were ordered to carry a small supply of opium.91 Yet on the whole, as the \nvery fact of close investigation into this handful of ships reveals, high mortality on board \ntransportation ships sailing in both directions was exceptional.  \n 22 \nMutiny was not simply the result of convicts responding to poor conditions, but \nwas enabled by failures in securing or guarding them. When the Catherine was inspected \nprior to the convicts\u2019 embarkation in 1838, for instance, there was no survey in these \nrespects. Neither were the convicts\u2019 possessions searched.92 The Ararat (1859) convicts \nwere said to have secreted a knife on board, which they had used to cut themselves free. \nThere followed an extraordinarily violent uprising. The crew largely escaped injury, but \n35 of the 74 convicts were either shot or went overboard.93 In every case where convicts \nmanaged to take over ships it is clear that the crew had flouted the regulations on the \nmovement of convicts on board or the storing of weaponry. On occasion, not enough care \nwas taken with the passing of convicts between decks, or large numbers of convicts were \nallowed up for air at once. The senior magistrate of police in Bombay concluded that \nsuch unregulated movement was also the cause of events on the Virginia. All 34 convicts \nhad been on deck at the same time.94 The secretary to government of Bombay put the \nmutiny on the Recovery (1846) in part down to slack management in the movement of \nconvicts around the ship.95 Thirty men had rushed at captain Thomas Johnson, though \nastonishingly he had managed to beat them off and only one convict was killed.96 The \nBombay superintendent of convicts recommended that in future that no convicts should \nbe permitted on deck until any men already up there had been locked down. Only one \nconvict should be allowed on the ladder at a time.97 The European guard on board the \nArarat was said to have fallen asleep on duty, allowing the convicts to come up \nunchallenged. Indeed, he was later found stabbed, apparently whilst still asleep.98 \nSometimes weaponry was not properly locked up. Eighteen loaded muskets were stored \n 23 \nwithin arm\u2019s reach of the Kaleegunga convicts\u2019 sleeping quarters. All 39 convicts on \nboard escaped.99\nAll convicts were embarked for transportation wearing irons; those of dangerous \nor notorious offenders were heavier than usual. Sometimes convicts were even chained \nfrom the waist to the wrists and neck.\n  \n100 As I have noted elsewhere, fetters were a far \nfrom perfect penal technology because they both sustained and confounded the goals of \nprison management.101 The restriction that they placed on movement caused real \nproblems in marching and working convicts, and for this reason in practice lighter ones \nserving as little more than a visual tag of criminality were often used. It was also \naccepted practice for convicts to tie their chains up around their waists, greatly \nameliorating the restrictions on movement that fetters were supposed to cause.102 The \nsuperintendent of convicts in Bombay claimed that the disturbances on board the \nRecovery were partly the result of district prisoners being received on board wearing \nlighter than normal irons. This was necessary because they were marched \u2013 often from a \nconsiderable distance\u2013 to Tannah jail ready for embarkation. During the uprising, the \nheavier irons worn by the Tannah convicts had prevented them from getting upon deck. \nOnly the district prisoners had managed to do so. Captain Johnson wrote: \u2018their irons are \nof no use only to deceive us\u2019.103\nEven when heavy irons were worn, the fit was not always good. Those used on \nboth the Harriet Scott and the Ararat were apparently so big that convicts simply slipped \nthem off.\n \n104 Master attendant D. Ross claimed that the fetters worn by the Virginia \nconvicts gave \u2018too much freedom of their limbs\u2019.105 In addition, if shackles were even \nslightly corroded, they were easily removed.106 Once removed, irons could be turned \n 24 \nfrom an instrument of punishment to a means of resistance, for they could be tied up to \nmake \u2018a formidable weapon\u2019.107 After the death of captain Benyon on the Harriet Scott, \nthe Bombay authorities recommended that in future fetters should be made with several \nrivet holes in order to adjust them to fit the ankle.108 Even the heaviest irons were a \nrelatively unsophisticated means of securing convicts. In the case of the Kaleegunga, the \nconvicts were locked on a single chain padlocked at one end only. If one man needed to \nbe released, the whole had to be unlocked. When two men were let off to answer the call \nof nature, the remaining convicts accordingly took this chance to slip off the chains and \nattack the ship\u2019s officers.109\nIrons sometimes caused awful sores on prisoners\u2019 ankles and legs; left untreated \nthey could lead to gangrene and even death.\n \n110 Penal administrators were always \nsuspicious that convicts rubbed their irons deliberately in order to shirk labour, so they \nissued ankle leathers to protect the skin. Convicts too bound cloth around the shackles of \nthe irons. However, this meant that the fetters were hidden from view and they could file \nthem through gradually without attracting attention, as in the case of the Catherine.111 \nEven when their irons were not bound with cloth, convicts were able to cut them \nunobserved. Convict Gourmohun Soor, en route to Penang on the Ariel in 1813, for \ninstance, was able to cut his irons and jump overboard.112 Forty years later, the \nsuperintendent of Alipur jail, H. Fergusson, wrote that several convicts who had arrived \nin the jail for transportation in 1856 had almost cut through their ankle rings. The \nconvicts told him that they had used waxed silk, and stuffed the cuts with cement made \nfrom wax, chaman and dye so that they could not be seen. Fergusson added that he had \nseen the same thing in Alipur jail, and suggested a prohibition against convicts having \n 25 \ncord, thread or silk on their clothes or bedding.113 He noted that often small files, iron \nnails and emery boards were found sewed in the folds and ends of transportation \nconvicts\u2019 bedding.114\nThough poor management in a general sense gave convicts both the motive and \nthe opportunity to rebel, there is a further dimension to shipboard disorder. It took place \nmainly when convicts on board had experience at sea. I think this explains why convict \nmutinies occurred overwhelmingly on vessels sailing out of Bombay or the Straits \nSettlements, rather than Bengal or Madras. Two of the Virginia convicts, for instance, \nwere sailors by profession. They were variously described as \u2018caffrees\u2019 and \u2018sydees\u2019 \n(both words here meaning African) and before their arrest the governor of Bombay, J.R. \nCarnac, wrote that they would probably try and make for Mozambique or Arabia.\n \n115 At \nleast one of the convicts shipped on the Catherine had been a lascar.116 Moideen Ally of \nthe Chinsurah was also a seaman.117 Many of the convicts involved in the Straits \nmutinies had been convicted of piracy \u2013 as in the case of eight of the 16 convicts \ntransported on the Harriet Scott,118 and the 52 pirates embarked on the Ararat.119 The \nconvicts of the General Wood too carried 92 pirates from Hong Kong to Singapore.120 It \nwas not simply that convict seafarers were on board though, for there are hints in the \nsources that captains of vessels sometimes took them on as crew, though they were not \nsupposed to. This was an informal arrangement through which the captain gained a free \npair of hands and the convicts escaped from the privations below deck. After he was \npicked up at sea, the captain of the Lady Wallace (1840), which had been accidentally \nshipwrecked off Cape Comorin, for instance, declined to mention that he had convicts on \n 26 \nboard. When challenged to hand them over to the authorities he refused angrily, stating \nthat they were \u2018like private servants to him\u2019.121\nOf course if convicts could persuade ships\u2019 crews to assist them, skills at sea were \nnot so important, and this brings me to another point \u2013 the alliances forged between \nconvicts and crew, particularly when the former were sailors by profession.\n \n122 \nFrequently, the possibility of such collusion was a focus for post-mutiny investigations, \nwith the colonial authorities suspicious about the role played by ships\u2019 crews during \nconvict takeovers. As Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker have pointed out, crews were \ninternational and often found themselves locked up in the jails of colonial port cities. \nMoreover, working on a ship was in many ways like being in prison.123 This suggests that \ncrew might have had some sympathy for convicts. It is of course difficult to make sense \nof the material, for crews had an obvious reason for downplaying their role during \ncolonial investigations, and convicts an obvious reason for playing it up. When he was \nrecaptured, convict Siddee Almas of the Virginia claimed that some of the crew were in \nleague with the mutineers, and that they had assisted in landing them on shore.124\n \n \nConsider this exchange between gunner Jacob de Cruz, the judge and two other Virginia \nconvicts during their supreme court trial: \nQuestion by Hameer Radhoo, Prisoner: Did the Convicts throw the Captain overboard or \nthe people of the Ship. \nAnswer: We did not \u2026 \nQuestion Do [ditto]. What and how many persons took the Boats to the Land and when \nwas it. \nAnswer. The Convicts took away 3 Boats at night. \nQuestioned by the Judge. Did any of the Crew go in the Boats. \nAnswer. We lowered the Boats, but they took them on shore. No Lascars or Seamen were \nwith them. \nQuestion by Prisoner. Did you not conspire with us. \n 27 \nAnswer. Never. I have served the English since the age of 15 years \u2026 \nQuestion by Saduck Ali [convict]. Did the Crew know of this disturbance before it \nhappened. \nAnswer: No. \nQuestioned by the Judge. How do you know that. \nAnswer. If they had they would have told me.125\n \n \nIt was beyond doubt that gunner Joseph de Cruz had steered the ship to shore, and that \nthe ship\u2019s cook had provided for the convicts;126 but it was impossible to prove whether \nthey had done so willingly or under duress. The second mate of the Freak, Francis Ward, \nclaimed that the crew was \u2018very familiar with the convicts\u2019, and thought that they must \nhave known of the convicts\u2019 intentions. Once again, this could not be proved.127\nAll too often, when convicts took to arms, ship crews scrambled up the rigging or \njumped overboard to meet their fate in Davy Jones\u2019 locker. According to the report in the \nBengal Hurkaru, for instance, as soon as the convicts broke loose the crew of the Ararat \n(who were unarmed) climbed up the rigging.\n Indeed, \nit is perhaps worthy of note that no crew members were convicted alongside their convict \ncharges in any of the cases under discussion.  \n128 One kalassi (sailor) on board the Clarissa \nclaimed that most of his comrades were either shot or jumped overboard in the affray. He \nhimself with about ten others had gone up the rigging, and only came down when the \nconvicts promised to spare their lives if they would sail the ship for them. When they \nlanded on shore, the convicts took them prisoner.129 The burra tindal (head petty officer) \nalso spoke of the lascars being \u2018set to work\u2019.130 What is more conclusive is the extent of \neveryday interaction between convicts and crew. Convicts employed on board ship were \non deck most of the time; others came up for air at least once a day. This gave them \nample opportunity to converse with crew members. Those convicts who cooked on board \n 28 \nship prepared their rations with the crew. During the Virginia trial, convict Saduck Ali \neven claimed that the crew had given them marijuana to smoke, and after three days \nwithout food their \u2018heads were turned\u2019. It was this, he claimed, that had caused the \nmutiny.131\nAnother fear on the part of the colonial authorities was the ambivalence of the \nmilitary guard in preventing mutiny. The regulations on transportation itself were framed \naccording to notions of race and loyalty, and as we have seen the ratio of European or \nIndian guards to convicts was fixed accordingly. In each of these outbreaks, the requisite \nnumber of guards was on board, and so at worst colonial officials considered the Indian \nguard collusive and at best inactive in putting down uprisings. One official wrote that the \nKaleegunga incident was the inevitable result of hiring men for just three rupees a trip. \nAnother stated that he heard them say that they were not going to risk their lives for such \nwages.\n \n132 A third noted that the sentries had been extremely familiar with the convicts.133 \nOn board was a \u2018Sikh general\u2019, Narain Singh, and two of his subordinates. All three had \nbeen sentenced to transportation in the Panjab for treason.134 The guards were no doubt in \nawe of their convict charges, for they were important military commanders in their own \nright. Even after their recapture and imprisonment, they were found with files in their \npossession, which it was believed the jail guards had passed to them.135 The difference in \nstructures of command was also a factor in the inactivity of guards. When three convicts \njumped overboard the Aurora in 1800, for example, the sepoys on board did nothing. \nBecause they were not subject to his military discipline, the commander of the vessel was \nat a loss about how to deal with them.136 \n 29 \nMutiny could be a response to conditions on board ship by men with skills at sea. \nHowever, as the actions of Narain Singh show \u2013 and as we will see in our discussion of \nthe mutiny on board the Clarissa in 1854 - the desire to escape from British control was \nalso a factor and, in this sense, at least some ship mutinies drew on wider-ranging socio-\npolitical grievances.137 There is a great deal of evidence that many incidents were pre-\nplanned, often while convicts were still in prison. A paper detailing the convicts\u2019 plan \nwas found on the Catherine convicts, for instance.138 According to two of the convicts on \nboard, Sahoa Fuzul and Rama Balloo, the ringleaders were bhils named Kondajee Bapoo \nand Ram Chunder Valalloo. They had used a \u2018conjuring book\u2019 in deciding the timing of \nevents.139 This can probably be read as a reference to the witchcraft and sorcery in which \ncommonly bhils were believed to engage.140\nThere is also some evidence of divisions between Hindu and Muslim convicts in \nthis respect, though the material is difficult to interpret. Archival evidence suggests that \nevents on the Freak were the result of particular desires on the part of the Muslim \nconvicts on board, for instance. Convict informer Michael Anthony claimed that after \nkilling the chief mate, one of the convicts declared: \u2018\u201cnow all the poison all the liquor is \ncoming out.\u201d\u2019 They then threw the crew\u2019s shoes overboard, declaring them \u2018\u201cinfidels\u2019 \nthings\u201d\u2019.\n  \n141 Once rid of the ship\u2019s crew, the convicts resolved to go to Mecca (second \nmate Francis Ward\u2019s testimony is in agreement with Michael Anthony\u2019s on this point).142 \nWhen they realised they would likely be taken up at sea, they decided to go to Aceh \ninstead \u2013 according to Michael Anthony because \u2018all are Musselmen there and they \nwould be safe.\u2019 He claimed that the leader, Hadjee Hussain, asked the second mate whose \ncountry it was: \n 30 \n \n[H]e said a Mohamedan country, the inhabitants are Malay. Hadjee Hussain asked if \nthere are any English? [T]he 2nd mate said \u201cNo\u201d if the English go there they are killed \nand if an English vessel go there, all the men are killed and the ship plundered, Hadjee \nHussain asked how large is the country 2nd mate said 14 miles broad and 200 long. The \nRajah and Troops reside there, and 12 Governors in different parts, so Hadjee Hussain \nsaid \u201ctake the vessel there\u201d and the 2nd mate steered for Aceh.143\n \n \nWhat to make of this testimony? Michael Anthony \u2013 elsewhere described as Miguel \nAntonio \u2013 was described as a \u2018native Catholic\u2019 who could speak English.144 During the \nuprising he acted as an interpreter between the convicts and crew.145 He may have felt \nsome sort of cultural alignment with the Europeans on board, for he claimed that the \nconvict mutineers made threats against them all as kafirs (infidels). As Ranajit Guha has \nargued in another context, rebelliousness does sometimes have its roots in religion.146 In \nthe case of the Recovery, the convicts were said to have sworn on the Qur\u2019an to mutiny. \nBefore the ship set sail rumours reached the authorities that some Arabic vessels would \nbe waiting in the harbour to help them. When they did not appear, the captain dropped his \nguard, and it was then that the convicts rose.147\nThe convicts of the General Wood had their own dreams of freedom too, and \nattempted to sail the vessel back to China. According to lieutenant Seymour, who was in \ncharge of the guard on board, the mutinous convicts had threatened repeatedly his wife. \nThey said that had she been the wife of the deputy superintendent of police in Hong \nKong, they would have \u2018chopped her into pieces\u2019.\n Yet divisions between convicts on board \nship were not necessarily based on religion. Gender, social standing, skill base \u2013 and as \nwe will see in our analysis of the Clarissa mutiny \u2013 regional origin all played a part. \n148 A piece of \u2018Chinese writing\u2019 was \n 31 \nfound on one of the convicts. The translation of this paper speaks to their sense of \ncommon experience: \n \nIf any of us should die, the death of such person is to be made known to the survivors. \nIf any of us should succeed in procuring a boat the same is to be made known to all of us. \nNone of us are to leave the Island [Pulo Oly, to the southeast of Cambodia] until we have \nfed and lived well so as not to be recognized as convicts when we get to China. \nWhen I go to China, no one save God will know who I am. \nWe are to share alike in every thing, if we procure food we are to share alike. \nIf one of us procure[s] a boat the same is to be made known to all of us, that we may go \ntogether. \nWe all swear to assist and stand by one another to the last. \nGod only besides ourselves shall know our actions and what is in our possession.149\n \n \nSuch \u2018round robins\u2019 captured what Rediker describes as the \u2018collective logic\u2019 behind \nmutiny. They were used to organise resistance without revealing the identity of its \nringleaders.150\n \n  \nWhat shall we do with the drunken sailor? Authority at sea \nBefore turning to a detailed analysis of one mutiny - that took place on board the convict \nship Clarissa in 1854 - I would like to make some comments about the personal nature of \nauthority at sea and what Rediker has described as its often violent and arbitrary \nnature.151 \u2018Hydrarchy\u2019 might have characterised the ship as a space of resistance, but any \nhint of disorder on the part of the convicts met with an immediate and harsh response. In \n1832, for instance, the crew of a ship carrying 40 convicts from the Straits to Bombay, \nthe Fort William, heard a noise coming from the convicts\u2019 quarters. Captain James Peish \nordered them to secure the hatches, went below decks, seized the convict who seemed to \nbe the ringleader and flogged him immediately in front of all the others.152 Captain \n 32 \nThomas Johnson of the Freak summarily flogged a convict who had threatened to kill \nhim.153\nWhen the convicts of the Singapore Packet complained about their rations, they \nwere unsatisfied by captain Tingate\u2019s response, and broke out of their accommodation \nbelow deck. Though it is not exactly clear what happened next, four of them died from \nthe wounds they received. The governor of the Straits, S.G. Bonham, congratulated the \ncaptain, with the press reporting his most satisfactory \u2018bold and manly conduct\u2019.\n \n154 \nAttempted mutiny on board the Recovery was suppressed with even more brutality. \nCaptain Johnson gave all convicts on deck at the time three dozen lashes, and 20 others \n\u2018as much as they could take\u2019 - his being assured that they were at the bottom of events.155 \nThe Bengal Hurkaru later reported these actions of \u2018courage and promptitude.\u2019156\nIn at least two cases the sort of violence that seems to have characterised relations \nat sea was the catalyst if not the cause of unrest. The attempt to seize the Catherine for \nexample took place after convict Kondajee Bapoo complained about his fetters - or \nrations, depending on whether you believe captain Pendygrass or the convict who turned \ninformer, Rama Balloo. Both men agreed that the captain slapped Kondajee around the \nface, and threatened him with a flogging. Convict Rama Balloo stated that later that \nevening Kondajee resolved to murder him.\n \n157 One of the Virginia convicts, Hameer \nRhadoo, claimed that captain Whiffen had threatened to seize any man who was seasick \nand throw him overboard. Other convicts spoke of being kicked and thrown down by \nhim.158 Captain Benyon of the Harriet Scott killed one of the convicts trying to get up the \nhatch. This enraged the remainder, and they apparently \u2018cut his body in pieces\u2019. The \nremaining crew killed seven more.159 \n 33 \nConvict Rama Balloo was not unusual in giving information to the authorities. \nInforming was officially encouraged in prisons and penal settlements, and the authorities \noffered convicts rewards for turning against their fellow men. Informing was an integral \npart of colonial penal strategies, and convicts who warned the authorities of imminent \nattacks were well rewarded with release from fetters, hard labour on the roads or even \nremission of sentence. Mutiny plots sometimes came to light when convict informers \nmade their intentions known to one of the officers on board. In the case of the Recovery \n(1846), for instance, prisoner Hussa Bulla reported that he had overheard convicts \nawaiting embarkation in Bombay county jail planning to seize their ship, claiming that a \nship would accompany them out of Bombay to help them.160 It seems that Rama Balloo \nhad been involved in the Catherine plot too, and offered to give information against his \ncomrades if the captain released him from irons.161 The convict Sahoo Fazul also gave \ninformation.162 The captain of the Recovery claimed that he knew who was involved \n\u2018from information I got from other Prisoners\u2019.163 Unfortunately for Rama Balloo, his \noffence (administering intoxicating drugs with intent to rob) was described as so serious \nthat he was not recommended for release. Sahoo Fazul was.164 It was not uncommon for \nconvicts like Rama Balloo to turn informer. Juggenath Ramjee too, one of the ringleaders \nin the planned Chinsurah mutiny (1852), also told a jemadar (superior military officer) \non board what was about to take place.165 It is difficult to say what motivated them: fear \nof failure, or of the consequences? In other cases convicts gave incriminating information \nduring post-insurrection court proceedings. This was known as the admission of King\u2019s \nor Queen\u2019s evidence. Here motive is easier to read, for it led to their automatic acquittal. \nNasen, of the General Wood mutineers for instance escaped sentence in this way.166  \n 34 \nAfter an attempted mutiny on board the Ararat, sailing from the Straits \nSettlements to Bombay in 1859, captain Joachim Manuel Correya stripped all the \nsurviving convicts naked, and gave them as much of a flogging as they could stand: three \nand in some cases four dozen lashes, a substantial punishment. This included the 28 men \nwho it was obvious had taken no part in the disturbance because they had been locked in \nthe hold the whole time.167 Again the Hurkaru congratulated this man \u2018of courage and \npluck\u2019 for staving off disaster. Reported in the style of a Boy\u2019s Own Adventure, the \nnewspaper went on to note that the captain\u2019s wife had displayed extraordinary courage in \nloading and reloading her husband\u2019s pistols, passing them up to him from the cuddy.168 \nThe secretary of state for India was not so forgiving of his actions, writing that the level \nof violence used against innocent men was \u2018quite inexcusable\u2019, and that the stripping of \nthe convicts was \u2018to say the least, a very cruel measure.\u2019169 The advocate-general \nrecommended that the magistracy if not the supreme court institute legal proceedings \nagainst Correya, for a harsh and unnecessarily severe act.170 However, the senior \nmagistrate of police decided to take no action beyond recommending that he should not \ncommand transportation ships in future.171 The board agreed.172 The captain himself \nclaimed that he had removed the convicts\u2019 clothing to make sure that none had hidden \nweapons,173 but there is no doubt that the public removal of garments was also an \nemasculating punishment which, as I have noted elsewhere, was part of the armoury of \ncolonial penal practice during the first half of the nineteenth century.174 Forty years \nearlier, the commander of the Ariel, D. Jones, reported that after convict Gourmohun \nSoor escaped, he had stripped the remainder to see if any had hidden sharp implements \nwith which they might cut their irons.175  \n 35 \nGiven the stakes \u2013 and knowledge of convicts\u2019 former successes that must surely \nhave prayed on captains\u2019 minds - the violence directed against convict mutineers is \nperhaps unsurprising. Yet as we have seen, there was a fine line between what was \nacceptable and what was not, and a certain colonial ambivalence about the issue. Like the \ncaptain of the Ararat, the chief mate of the Harriet Scott John MacDuff was lucky to \nescape a jail sentence. Fourteen of the 16 convicts on board had mutinied on the way \nfrom Penang to Bombay in 1843. They killed captain Philip Benyon and for a brief time \ntook control of the ship. Seven of the convicts escaped (they were later taken back to \nPenang by another vessel), and the crew finally managed to overpower the remainder.176 \nMacDuff had drunk a considerable amount of brandy and was - according to the \ntestimony of Robert Cort, a passenger on board - staggering about. In this drunken state, \nMacDuff shot two convicts who had taken no part in the mutiny. Fearing what might \nhappen next, the passengers and crew placed him in irons.177 W.J. Butterworth, governor \nof the Straits Settlements, described MacDuff\u2019s actions as barbaric.178 He was arrested \nwhen the ship arrived back in Penang and the authorities indicted him for manslaughter, \nbut he was acquitted. Though the judge congratulated him on the verdict, the secretary to \nthe government of Bombay later wrote that he was disappointed that he had not been \nconvicted.179\nOnce they had successfully taken a ship, convict mutineers relished the \nopportunity to turn the nature of violence at sea on its head. The Virginia convicts for \nexample beat captain Whiffen\u2019s brains out, until his left eye was forced from its \nsocket.\n \n180 Those on the Harriet Scott broke captain Benyon\u2019s back, and left his head \n\u2018shockingly fractured\u2019. Second mate Thomas Jones placed his body in an empty cask, and \n 36 \npoured a keg of brandy on it in order to preserve it for burial.181 Magistrate E.H. \nLushington described what he saw on the Kaleegunga thus: \u2018The decks of both vessels \nwere dyed with blood at one end lay a man with his stomach ripped open near him was a \npool of Blood where it is said a man\u2019s head had been severed from his body\u2019.182 There \nwas something symbolic about convict violence too. After captain Whiffen\u2019s death, the \nconvict Saduck Ali cut the back of Whiffen\u2019s thighs with a sword.183 When the captain of \nthe Clarissa was put into the jolly boat, fatally wounded, there was according to one of \nthe sepoys on board \u2018a very great noise in the ship\u2019.184 Michael Anthony, a convict on the \nFreak, spoke of the attack against captain Thomas Suffield thus. The convicts had first \ntied the captain up: \u2018The 2nd Prisoner kicked the Captain when he asked for water, he had \ntied up his irons and so was able to kick the Captain \u2026 [he] kicked the Captain and said \nhe should have only two tinpots\u2019. After cutting the captain and chief mate\u2019s throats, the \nFreak convicts chained them up before throwing them overboard.185 It seems \u2013 as second \nmate Francis Ward said - that after the crew had uncovered a plot by the convicts the \ncaptain had chained all of them to the chain cable, thinking that if they caused trouble \nthey could all be thrown over board with the anchor.186 According to Michael Anthony \nduring the uprising one of the convicts said: \u2018\u201cnow this chain has been so many days on \nyour legs is now on their\u2019s [sic]\u201d\u2019.187\nA second aspect of the inversion of authority at sea was the destruction of the ship\u2019s \npapers, especially the ship\u2019s log and the roll individually identifying each convict \u2013 the \nconvict indent. The ripping up or burning of official papers \u2013 the monotonous daily \nrecord that might have damned an individual or in which each convict was carefully \nregistered and described \u2013 was a highly symbolic act, for it prevented convict bodies \n \n 37 \nfrom being matched to their criminal record. The Freak convicts apparently threw all the \n\u2018books and papers\u2019 found in the captain\u2019s cabin overboard.188 Officials going on board \nships after mutinies frequently described how their papers were strewn all around, scenes \nof disorder standing in stark contrast to the methodical order of colonial record-\nkeeping.189\nThird, after taking ships, convicts often dressed themselves in the clothes of the \ncaptain and his officers. The Freak convicts for instance adorned themselves with the \ngarb of the captain and chief mate,\n  \n190 as did those of the General Wood.191 The leaders of \nthe Virginia convicts too put on the captain\u2019s coat and hat.192 There is no evidence that \nconvicts stripped ships\u2019 officers; rather clothes were stolen from the hold. This was \npossibly meant to fool passing ships that all was in order,193 but these acts were also clear \ninversions of authority. Yet authority was not overturned altogether and convicts used \nclothing in their construction of alternative structures of command. Dress became a visual \ntoken of status and power \u2013 convict leaders usually wore the captain\u2019s coat, sash and \nsword; others took silk handkerchiefs and wore them around their necks. Finally, feasting \nat the captain\u2019s table usually followed a successful mutiny. The convicts enjoyed a sort of \ncarnivalesque atmosphere on board. The Freak convicts slaughtered four sheep and six \nfouls, and made pilaf and curry for all on board. They then turned the ship\u2019s stock of \nsugar into sherbet. According to Michael Anthony, though the Hindus and Muslims dined \nseparately there was \u2018dancing singing merry making\u2019.194 The Virginia convicts too ate at \nthe captain\u2019s table.195 In these extraordinary scenes, dressed in the garb of captain and \ncrew and feasting on their provisions, convicts must have delighted at their metaphorical \ncapsizing of the transportation ship. \n 38 \n \n\u2018The Ferringees are flying \u2013 the ship is ours\u2019: mutiny on the Clarissa \nThe mutiny on board the Clarissa in 1854 caused a sensation. In the words of the \nadvocate-general of Bengal, it was a case of \u2018great atrocity and destruction of life\u2019, and \nan example had to be made of the ringleaders.196 One hundred and thirty-three escaped \nconvicts were placed on trial in the district court of Amherst (Moulmein), each charged \nwith \u2018being an accomplice in the murder of the captain and part of the crew and guard on \nboard the Clarissa and in escaping from custody, from the said barque, and affray with \nculpable homicide\u2019. In a 13-day hearing S.R. Tickell (principal commissioner and district \nmagistrate of the Tenasserim and Martaban Provinces) convicted 29 of the convicts of \naffray with culpable homicide and four of murder, and directed that they be committed to \ntrial in the appropriate court, as his district court had no jurisdiction to try offences \ncommitted on the high seas. He wrote that not only had they attacked the captain and \ncrew with \u2018every kind of missile they could lay their hands on\u2019, but that they had caused \nthe death of many more who jumped overboard. Almost half of the crew and guard died, \n31 out of 61 souls.197\nThose convicts fit to travel (129) were returned to Bengal to face trial in \nCalcutta\u2019s supreme court (admiralty side).\n \n198 The chief judge, Sir J. Colville, stated that it \nwas the most serious case that he had ever come across.199 Company officials decided to \ntry the convicts under three heads other than piratical seizure of the vessel: thus 18 men \nwere charged with the murder of the captain, three more with the murder of the subadar \n(head) and havildar of the guard, and one with shooting a kalassi after he jumped \noverboard. The difficulty for the authorities was, of course, as in all mutiny cases that \n 39 \nreached the courts, proving that individual convicts had committed specific acts.200 In the \nconfusion that characterised outbreaks, this was not easy, particularly as the leaders of \nmutinies like these were often killed on the spot. In this respect, of all the mutiny cases \nonly Narain Singh of the Kaleegunga was singled out, meaning that despite an 11-day \ntrial the rest could only be convicted of escaping from the vessel.201 As the government \nsolicitor in Bombay put it in his legal opinion on the attempted mutiny on the Ararat, \nproceedings could not be taken against convicts for simply \u2018yelling\u2019 or \u2018being \ndisobedient\u2019.202 Sixteen of the Clarissa men died after their capture and readmission to \nAlipur jail, and most of the remainder were transported to serve their original sentence \u2013 \nas the judge put it \u2018to that place of exile and that life of slavery to which you have been \nalready condemned\u2019. These men were marked out, and the lieutenant-governor of Bengal \ndecided that they would not be allowed to earn remission of sentence through future good \nbehaviour, like other convicts in the Straits Settlements. Instead they would remain in the \nfifth class, and be kept at hard labour during the whole term of their sentence. Four of \nthem were sentenced to death.203\nThe Clarissa left Calcutta on 26 April 1854, destined for the penal settlement at \nMelaka. The pre-embarkation survey had reported that the ship could hold 155 convicts. \nThe superintendent of marine noted that the usual space allowed to each convict was six \nby half a foot and by this measure it could carry 171 men.\n  \n204 It is clear that the very \nmaximum number of convicts was squeezed on board, though whether this played a part \nin the mutiny is less certain. First officer James Squire later reported that when the \nconvicts first embarked they complained to him, the captain and the subadar of the guard \nabout the lack of room.205 Goolah, a kalassi on board, testified during the magistrate\u2019s \n 40 \nhearing that the convicts complained about the crowding and heat below decks.206 \nAccording to another member of the crew, the outbreak on the Clarissa started when one \nman complained that he did not get enough water, and struck the sepoy guard on the head \nwith his lotah.207 Third mate Charles Blaney later said that \u2018the convicts used to grumble \nabout not having enough water\u2019.208 Boor Singh, one of the convicts put it like this: \u2018In the \nship we all got cheated out of our provisions. Short measure and not enough water. All \nmen discontented and began to be alarmed at our fate.\u2019209 Indeed, it seems that one of the \nfirst things the convicts did after seizing the ship was to make a drink by mixing some \nsugar that they found in the hold with seawater.210 The uprising was planned at least a \nweek before \u2013 several convicts testified to this211 \u2013 and it was to a certain extent \nopportunistic. As on many other transportation ships, there were ten unfettered convicts \nup on deck who were employed as sweepers, and in other ship duties. Disorder broke out \nwhen they were serving water to 12 convicts who had been brought out of the hold.212\nSheikh Ramran, a sepoy guard, stated that during his five former trips with \nconvicts he had never seen arrangements such as were made on board the Clarissa. He \nclaimed that the muskets were kept on deck and the ammunition in the main hatch (at \nsome distance away), and that 12 convicts were always on deck, four without handcuffs. \nOne convict, he said, was even in charge of the captain\u2019s swords and muskets.\n \n213 In this, \nas in the rationing and fitting out of convict ships, there was often a large gap between the \nrules and practices of convict transportation. Access to arms did not however imply \nsuccessful use of them. One of the convicts stated in his defence: \u2018I am a cultivator ... I \nnever knew how to hold a musket how could I have fired one on board[?]\u2019.214 However, it \n 41 \nis evident that some of the convicts on board were well versed in the operation of \nweaponry. \nAccording to officials who appeared before magistrate Tickell, and press reports \nthat were published in July, the events were as follows. A group of convicts captured the \nship, and murdered captain Johnstone, the chief and second mates (all Englishmen) \ntogether with a number of the crew. They then ransacked the ship \u2013 destroying the log \nbook and register (the convicts\u2019 descriptive roll) \u2013 ran the ship aground and landed on the \nBurmese shore with all the arms and ammunition on board, some rope and canvas \n(presumably to make shelters) and as many provisions as they could carry. They believed \n\u2013 mistakenly as it turned out \u2013 that they had landed in territory as yet untaken by the \nBritish. Magistrate Tickell was informed and sent a party in search of the convicts, who \nwere said to be near Ye, a small town between Rangoon and Tavoy. He was afraid that if \nthe men remained at large, unrest might break out amongst the transported convicts \nalready in the provinces, who numbered about two thousand. Yet the most worrisome \naspect of the mutiny for him was the fact that these were not ordinary convicts, but \n\u2018Seikhs, Pathans, Rohillas and the like\u2019. As such, recapturing them was no simple matter. \nMeanwhile, rumours of their whereabouts abounded.215\nThe escaped convict party quickly assumed the proportions of a military \ncampaign. One of the convicts \u2013 Soor Singh \u2013 assumed charge, putting on the captain\u2019s \ncoat and boots, and the gold necklace, sword and sash belonging to the subadar of the \nguard. He armed six other convicts, who wore the military guard\u2019s \u2018caps and \naccoutrements\u2019, referring to them as \u2018his sepoys\u2019.\n  \n216 They waded from the ship to the \nbeach, where they all assembled, Soor Singh sitting before them in a chair.217 Thinking \n 42 \nthat they were in Burmese country, the convicts decided to make their way to the \u2018Burma \nRajah\u2019 and offer him their services in anti-British campaigns. I will take up the story in \nthe words of Kurrim Singh, a convict who turned informer against his shipmates, \naccording to his testimony before the district magistrate\u2019s court: \n \nThey all went into the Rajah\u2019s Cutcherry. The Rajah salaamed and gave Soor Singh a \nchair to sit on, there were several interpreters there. The Rajah asked Soor Singh where \nhe had come from and where he was going to. Soor Singh said he was a sikh from Lahore \nand had come with 175 men to help the Burma Rajah. They had some conversation and \nthe Rajah wishing, as he said, to call all the rest of Soor Singh\u2019s men, Soor Singh gave \nhim one of his party to shew [sic] where they were and the Rajah sent 25 armed Burmese \nwith him. Scarcely had the man gone out, when Soor Singh\u2019s eyes alighted on a written \npiece of paper with a Court[\u2019]s [East India Company] seal impressed on it which was \nstuck against the wall. He instantly took the alarm, jumped to his feet and rushed out of \nthe House with his 5 men.218\n \n \nIn the gunfight all six convicts \u2013 including the leader Soor Singh - were killed.219 Over \nthe next few days, most of the remaining convicts were brought in. Only a couple of \ndozen remained unaccounted for, presumed drowned, starved or mauled by wild \nanimals.220\nSo who were the Clarissa convicts? The fact that the mutineers destroyed the ship \nindent (descriptive register) is a boon, for copies of ship indents were always kept in \nCalcutta as well as being sent to the penal settlements. Most of these \u2013 including the \nClarissa roll - survive in the Bengal judicial proceedings series.\n  \n221 But there is a second \nlist too, for at the time, once they realised their copy of the list was missing, officials in \nBurma made a new list from details given by the convicts themselves.222 This provides a \nunique insight into convicts\u2019 perceptions of the crime for which they were transported, \nand gives details of former occupation not usually recorded by officials in the \n 43 \npresidencies. The first \u2013 official \u2013 list does not seem to show anything unique. Like most \nconvicts at the time, they were transported for the crimes of dacoity (gang robbery), \nmurder or the rather woolly offence of thuggee.223\nDuring the sessions court hearings, a story of huge divisions between the convicts \non board the Clarissa emerges. At least some of the convicts were motivated by a desire \nto escape beyond British control, and tried to offer themselves in service against them. \nConvict Shaik Sooiah told magistrate Tickell that Soor Singh called out: \u2018The Ferringees \n[foreigners, meant here to signify the British] are flying \u2013 the ship is ours\u2019.\n There is only one exception: \nMohomed Buksh who was convicted of \u2018wounding with intent to murder Mr RP Jenkins, \nAssistant Commissioner of Leia by striking him on the head and shoulder with an iron \nhammer\u2019. A large majority of the convicts came from Lahore and Allahabad. The second \n\u2013 convict \u2013 list does not mention \u2018thuggee\u2019, only \u2018dacoity\u2019, which perhaps tells us \nsomething about convict perceptions (or confirms the vagueness) of the offence. Neither \nis the list suggestive that any of the convicts had been soldiers, except for the informer \nKurrim Singh. The leaders of the mutiny \u2013 who almost certainly had military \nbackgrounds - were all killed, however, so they are not on the convict-generated list. The \noriginal ship indents did not record occupation. Incidentally, in the convict-generated list, \nMohomed Buksh\u2019s crime appears as \u2018murder\u2019 \u2013 an attempt on the convict himself to \npresent himself in a more flattering light, or the contraction of a clerk under pressure? \nOnly about 30 of the convicts were from Bengal, a point we will return to below. \n224 Another \nconvict who claimed he was unconcerned in the outbreak \u2013 Beejah - deposed that he told \nthem \u2018you shall be taken to the Burma Raja\u2019s and there be all free men\u2019.225 The non-Sikh \nconvicts like Beejah (who referred to themselves in a rather eclectic way as Bengalis, \n 44 \n\u2018Deswalees\u2019, or Hindustanis) all claimed that they had nothing to do with the mutiny, \nwhich they said was the work of the Sikhs and some of the Muslims. It is perhaps notable \nthat the self-appellation \u2018Bengali\u2019 crossed religious lines, for according to the descriptive \nroll about a third of the Bengali convicts were Muslims themselves. The Bengalis \nclaimed that the Sikhs were kept separate, and after the mutiny they had imprisoned the \nBengalis below deck, giving them even less water than before. The seasickness of many \nmeant that they could not have joined in, even if they had wished to.226\n \n When the ship ran \naground, the mutineers made them carry their luggage. Cassee Barah put it like this: \nNone of us Bengallees had anything to do with the outbreak we were nearly murdered \nourselves and kept confined after the outbreak till we came to the shore, where we were \nforced to land and carry the Sikhs[\u2019] burden, till they went away across the river and we \nall gave ourselves up to the first Burmese who came up.227\n \n \nThe sorts of hierarchies on board ship were a further source of divisions between \nconvicts, for there is some evidence that the Clarissa mutineers targeted those who had \nenjoyed various privileges. Convict Bunkur Doss had been appointed overseer whilst in \nAlipur jail, and he had reported several of the men for bad conduct. He told magistrate \nTickell that he had been uninvolved in the mutiny: \u2018I was up on deck every day and better \noff than the rest I had no cause to join in the tumult.\u2019 However, his position in the penal \nhierarchy made him vulnerable. \u2018I now feared for my life,\u2019 he said.228 Though it is clear \nthat the unfettered working convicts on deck were crucial to the success of the seizure of \nthe ship, first officer James Squire said that there were often fights amongst convicts \nabout their provisions.229 \n 45 \nThe convict-turned-informer, Kurrim Singh, is an interesting character, for during \nlater evidence it emerged that he had been at the centre of events. Initially, the colonial \nauthorities in Burma wanted to believe his innocence and thereby construct a plausible \nversion of events in the face of a mass of confusing and contradictory evidence. How else \nto make sense of the testimony of almost over 100 witnesses? Tickell himself wrote on \nsubmitting the papers to Calcutta: \u2018In these proceedings, I trust all irregularities and \nomissions will be leniently considered. I have no precedent to guide me \u2026 The \ndifficulties are the magnitude of the case, its complexity, incessant interruptions, and the \nfact that the matters alleged have not been investigated by the police.\u2019230 If only Tickell \nhad had the original descriptive roll in his possession, for it listed Kurrim Singh as a \n\u2018desperate character requires to be carefully watched\u2019, the only convict on board so \ndescribed.231\nDuring the trial, a number of witnesses spoke of Kurrim Singh\u2019s pivotal role \nduring the mutiny. Sheikh Kurwodeen, a sepoy guard on board, testified that he was one \nof the self-elected convict jemadars (head overseers).\n  \n232 The convict Bunkur Doss (who \nhad been an overseer in Alipur jail) stated that he was one of the worst of the convicts, \nand that his word was \u2018good for nothing\u2019.233 A third man, Chatoo, claimed that he had \nplanned the whole thing days beforehand, and had been \u2018second in command\u2019 after Soor \nSingh.234 According to reports of the trial in the Bengal Hurkaru, Kurrim Singh said that \nhe had been an artilleryman in the fifth company at Rangoon, and understood a little \nBurmese.235 Yet magistrate Tickell wrote during the Amherst sessions that the evidence \nagainst him was insufficient and motivated only by the desire for revenge on the part of \nthe other convicts. This was clearly not the case. Superintendent of Alipur jail H. \n 46 \nFergusson wrote after the trial: \u2018It is now well known that he was one of the principal \ninstigators of the lamentable tragedy \u2026 He is a cunning, clever, intriguing desperate \nscoundrel and became approver against the men he had instigated and led.\u2019 The other \nconvicts had, apparently, sworn to take their revenge and murder him. Fergusson kept \nhim away from them in prison, and recommended that he be sent to a different penal \nsettlement. It was agreed that whilst the others be shipped to Melaka, he be sent to \nSingapore, and the resident councillor there informed of who he was.236\nI mentioned above that one of the convict guards testified that the captain of the \nClarissa had made rather unusual arrangements in the keeping of the ship\u2019s weaponry, \nand had even employed one of the convicts to clean his swords and muskets. He added \nthat the subadar of the guard had complained to the captain, who told him \u2018to hold his \ntongue\u2019.\n  \n237 It turns out that \u2013 despite the explicit warning noted on the descriptive roll - \nthis man was none other than convict-turned-informer Kurrim Singh.238 I suspect that the \ncaptain had a sneaking admiration for some of his convict charges, for at least some of \nthem were military men or in the words of one of the sepoys on board \u2018fine-looking \nfellows\u2019.239\nOn a former occasion a group of convicts from Allahabad seized the Kaleegunga, \non which they were being shipped to Calcutta for transportation. Three guards were killed \nduring the uprising. The notorious \u2018Sikh general\u2019, Narain Singh, and two of his \nsubordinates were on board.\n If this was the case, it was certainly a costly mistake. \n240 During this mutiny colonial stereotypes contrasting \nmanly, loyal Europeans with weak, treacherous natives were turned on their head. The \nEuropeans on board had simply fled, one man sergeant Cunningham jumping overboard \nleaving his wife and two children behind. Captain H.M. Nation who was in charge of the \n 47 \nguard much regretted \u2018the disgrace cast on the Europeans\u2019 character\u2019 by such acts.241 \nNarain Singh, on the other hand, had behaved with impeccable manners. Mary Ann \nCunningham said that when the other convicts suggested that they kill her Narain Singh \nhad said that because she had two young children she should be spared: \u2018He then turned \nto me and said you are my mothers and fathers it is not to take your life that we are doing \nthis it is to get away with our own lives.\u2019 He also saved the life of her two children.242 \nThe sessions judge certainly sympathised with the treatment Narain Singh \u2013 \u2018a man of \ncaste and rank\u2019 - had received, locked on a single chain with ordinary prisoners. He urged \nthe court to take \u2018the hardships of his situation\u2019 into account: \u2018the ignominy of being \ntreated as a common felon chained with the lowest criminals such as Thugs, Dacoits, and \nMurderers, and with sweepers by caste, to all [of] which he was subjected must have \nbeen to him, as he himself states less supportable than death.\u2019243 Despite finding him \nguilty of murder, he recommended him to the mercy of the court. The court also ordered \nthat all the other prisoners on board should be transported to serve their original \nsentence.244 The 25 convicts were shipped to Moulmein on the Fire Queen later that \nyear.245\nInvestigations into mutinies among Straits convicts sailing to mainland India often \npointed the finger of blame at crews\u2019 inability to read the criminals in their charge. As the \nsecond mate of the Harriet Scott, Thomas Jones, put it: \u2018the crew used to say that the \n The types of assumptions ships\u2019 commanders made about such convicts of rank \ncould be fatal. Kurrim Sing, and speculatively other convicts on board the Clarissa too, \nwere configured in relation to their military rank and social standing rather than their \nconviction and prior record. The privileges as such accorded to Kurrim Singh provided \nhim with the chance to mutiny.  \n 48 \nconvicts looked too innocent to do any harm.\u2019246\n \n The secretary to government Bombay, \nW. Norris, relied on familiar racial tropes when he wrote: \nPersons unacquainted with the Malayan character, are apt to suppose from his generally \ndull and phlegmatic countenance, that the Malay is a harmless and not unwilling slave, to \nbe coerced with ease, beaten with impunity and requiring no particularly vigilant \noversight. You are of course aware that, a more dangerous error cannot be fallen into, \nespecially in the case of Malayan convicts, who are generally persons of piratical and \nwandering habits, ardently fond of liberty, impatient of a restraint, reckless of their own \nlives, and those of others, courageous, hardy, revengeful and prepared at whatever cost, \nto resent a blow and to have recourse to any violence or stratagem to recover their \nfreedom.247\n \n \nIn future, commanders of vessels from the Straits were warned not to place the slightest \nconfidence in the convicts. Malays, Norris said, prized freedom and were sensitive to \nboth good treatment and to injury or insult: \u2018a blow is rarely if ever forgiven\u2019. He noted \nfurther that Chinese convicts were \u2018active, earnest and energetic\u2019, and would use their \n\u2018cunning and connivance\u2019 to assist them.248\nThe Sikh convicts on board the Clarissa denied the Bengalis\u2019 claims that they had \nled the mutiny. Assah Singh deposed: \u2018I came all the way from Lahore to Calcutta a \nthousand coss if I had wishes to rebel outbreak from confinement could I not have done \nso more easily during that long journey on land than at sea?\u2019\n \n249 He was one of the four \nconvicts sentenced to death, and apparently \u2018sneered\u2019 throughout the supreme court trial. \nWhen the sentence was read out, the press reported that he gave a \u2018sneering \ncontemptuous laugh which made one shudder\u2019.250 Convicts were free to cross-examine \nwitnesses in court, and sometimes did so with remarkable aplomb. Others refused to \nparticipate in the whole procedure. Bela, one of the Virginia defendants, was asked to \nquestion a witness in the court. He said: \u2018I am not a prophet to know what to ask \u2026 It is \n 49 \nyour Lordship[\u2019]s business to question him here if I met him the Bazaar I would ask him.\u2019 \nOne of his fellow shipmates - Hameer Rhadoo - had a clear sense of the only way they \nwould get justice, telling the judge: \u2018God is above and your Lordships below.\u2019251\n \n \nConclusion \nIndian convict ship mutinies were dramatic and complex events that can be rendered \nhistorically meaningful in multiple ways. With Indian convict transportation regulated by \nthe East India Company, the enquiries that invariably followed violent uprisings \ngenerated a voluminous archive. This gives us a unique insight into the convict middle \npassage. It is possible to use archival records on convict mutinies to reconstruct aspects \nof everyday life on board transportation vessels. They reveal colonial limitations in \nrelation to the management, confinement and provisioning of convicts, for there was a \nwide breach between the regulations and practices of transportation. There is no doubt \nthat although on the whole transportation ships were relatively healthy, overcrowding and \noutbreaks of disease could render conditions intolerable. This meant that convicts had \nvarious experiences. Such differentiation was compounded by the integration of convicts \ninto the remarkably hierarchical arrangements on board the convict ship. The variability \nof convict experiences was also in evidence in relation to caste practices. Ships\u2019 officers \nshowed some degree of sensitivity to them; ignorance could have devastating \nconsequences. In this sense, shipboard authority and convict agency were closely \nintertwined to the point that this potentially troublesome human cargo determined \nparticular aspects of shipboard life. \n 50 \nFurther, convict mutinies are suggestive of the existence of a particular regime of \nauthority at sea, which in taking over ships convicts simultaneously mimicked and \ninverted. Among colonial officials there was considerable anxiety about how best to deal \nwith refractory convicts \u2013 to read congratulatory press reports alone masks the substance \nof contemporary debates on the issue. On occasion officials on the Indian mainland \nseverely reprimanded ships\u2019 captains for the arbitrary authority they displayed towards \nconvicts. Mutinous convicts displayed few such nerves, for they delighted in turning \nships\u2019 regimes on their head \u2013attacking officers and crew, burning records, dressing in \nofficers\u2019 clothing, feasting, dancing and singing. Yet such convicts did not abandon \nshipboard authority regimes altogether. Some convicts set up their own structures of \nleadership in which they exploited other convicts to their own ends.  \nConvict uprisings therefore not only reveal the multi-faceted nature of the middle \npassage, but perhaps most significantly in their divisions and hierarchies they dispel \nsimplistic notions of a single convict identity or experience of transportation. This has \npotentially important ramifications for readings of subaltern studies more generally, \nparticularly in relation to interpretations of other forms of coerced labour and migration. \nWho was - or rather was rendered - subaltern, both by the colonial authorities and their \nfellow men and women, and how they played out that role, moved both within and \nbeyond supposedly common identities and experiences. \n \n 51 \nTable 1.
