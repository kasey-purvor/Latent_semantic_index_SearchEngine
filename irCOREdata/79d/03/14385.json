Although I am fortunate\nenough to have been able to participate in the AccessForAll work, the views I present\nhere are my own and may or may not reflect those of my co-editors in that work.\nI shall address some of the fundamental ideas in the paper in the light of the\nAccessForAll approach.\nThe AccessForAll work contains two central ideas: \n1. That resources are matched at delivery time with functional requirements of\nlearners or users that are relevant to that immediate context.\n2. That the components that comprise a delivered resource can be assembled from\ndistributed sources.\nThese ideas work in concert to deliver an experience that can be accessed by the indi-\nvidual in that context. Neither idea on its own is sufficient, and applying each without\nserious care for the goals in their design can have interesting, possibly undesirable,\nconsequences. (There is in fact a third idea\u2014that distributed resources and adapta-\ntions have associated metadata that enable us to find them, but space precludes\naddressing that here.)\nThe first of these ideas, matching resources to context, is not completely new. It is\narguable that since all computer systems aim to be usable they all set out to achieve\n*Axelrod Research and Consultancy, 51 Paterson Close, Stocksbridge, Sheffield, UK. Email:\nAndyHeath@axelrod.plus.com\n200 A. Heath\nthis but the mechanism available is informal. Without a standard way to record pref-\nerences and requirements, each application or system will take its own best guess at\nsuch a data set and the result will be that they each will have a different data set in\nmind. The mere existence of a standard format, such as the AccessForAll Personal\nNeeds and Preferences profile, can provide a target for applications to aim for. Thus\none might argue, as I interpret that the Learning Patterns paper does, that an author\nproviding content suitable for some environment can identify a generic set of prefer-\nences that apply to that environment (such as an \u2018audio profile\u2019). That process and\nset of preferences can then guide the author\u2019s thinking.\nWhile this is progress, a number of things are missing from the argument: \n1. The existence of a generic anonymous set of preferences is not the same as the\npreferences of an individual learner. It is like a \u2018type\u2019 statement for a variable as\ncan occur in a computer program. It is not an example value. At some level it will\nhide the individual requirements of a user. Using it is like a designer of roads\nintended for cars reading the blueprints for a bicycle and then designing cycling\nfacilities: at some level he\/she will get it wrong, unless he\/she asks the cyclists who\nwill use it to participate in the design.\n2. It is not distinct from the notion of a Universally Accessible Resource, which the\npaper rightly points out is a flawed notion because it is not achievable. The world\nalready has many design patterns for accessible design. There are, for example,\nnumerous sets of guidelines, the most notable being those of the Web Accessibil-\nity Initiative Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WAI, 2005). On their own,\nthey do not guarantee an accessible result (Kelly et al., 2005); indeed, used alone\nthey present the danger that a designer will claim that they do and believe they\nhave \u2018done\u2019 accessibility. Design patterns and guidelines are useful, but more\nwork is needed to explore how they may be used in practice without being\nmisused.\nThis brings us to the second of the ideas in AccessForAll and the reasons it is essential.\nOn the one hand, we argue that accessibility for disabled persons is a field where\nexpertise is specialised, difficult to learn and rare. This is the case because of the\ncomparatively small numbers of persons obviously disabled by current environments\nand the great diversity of assistive technology. On the other hand, we argue that we\nare doing \u2018Access\u2019 for everyone, and it needs to be generic to profit from benefits of\nscale. Both of these pictures are correct in some sense, but the first is where we are\ncurrently and the second is where we are aiming to get to. Technology always\nchanges, and business drivers and the wish for technology to serve the needs of people\nin a better way ensure we stay always at the leading edge of change. Consequently, it\nis probable that these two pictures will remain the case and our path will always be to\ntry and go from the first to the second. In striving to do this, there is the danger that\nthe user\u2019s needs will be forgotten or overridden by those of the vendor, system or\ncontent supplier or organisation. Using design templates carries the danger that they\ncan be used to meet only the needs of supplier organisations and avoid meeting the\nreal needs of individuals.\nExploiting opportunities computers provide 201\nThe second AccessForAll concept is based around the view that whatever we do we\nwill get it wrong and need to put it right, but that this is OK. We hold the tenet that\nit is unreasonable to expect all authors to have specialised accessibility expertise.\nWhatever tools content authors use or systems provide, they will have faults. Just as\na Universally Accessible Resource is not something that can exist, neither can there\nbe an authoring tool that creates one. So for any interesting learning object, however\ngood it is at being accessible to all, it is probable there will be some persons for whom\nit is not accessible. Making it accessible for such a person will require adaptations.\nThe job of creating adaptations is often best done by someone with expert knowledge\nof that user\u2019s accessibility requirements and of the context. Thus the person who does\nthat may be outside the organisation that originally produced the resource. In a\nuniversity, it may be a disability service. In the world of Hollywood films, it may be\na specialised captioning service. In an AccessForAll world, where components of a\nlearning object can be assembled at or close to run time and may come from inside\nor outside the organisation where the resource was authored, the person that\nauthored the adaptation may not be the person that had the design template in mind.\nIt seems that the notion of design templates alone may require that all authors become\nAccessibility-Aware. This is not likely to happen.\nI must ask, then, what the place of Design Templates is and whether they are of any\nvalue.\nIt seems clear, as the authors describe, that they can be useful in practice. Teachers\ndo use design templates\u2014it seems they know what patterns will and will not work in\nthe classroom and use those patterns. But they know also when to throw the template\naway and respond to an individual in a different way. It seems to me that technology\nis not yet very good at providing ways to do that. Sometimes we need to just break all\nthe rules and do something different because it works.\nA full treatment of AccessForAll would discuss issues around metadata authoring\nand searching, blended learning, granularity, aggregation formats and mapping\nbetween them, the semantic web and other complex areas of work in development in\nvarious places. While there is not space for that here, it is interesting to think briefly\nabout online resources, non-online resources and matching authored resources to\ncontext. It seems to me that books are an example of the use of Design Patterns that\nhas been well explored\u2014and they work. An author can use a standard pattern to write\na book without knowing the intimate details of the context in which the book will be\nread. The paper\u2019s treatment of design patterns seems very similar. But if we stick with\nthis model we may be bending only to the wishes of those who want to sell us content\nand tools and not getting the best use out of computers. Perhaps by coping with the\ncomplexities of really matching not to general templates but to individual require-\nments, we can get more out of computers than this. In this analysis it seems to me\nthat design templates in this context represent a half-way house between the world\nwhere we say to learners \u2018here is what I think you need to access this\u2019, and a world\nwhere learners say \u2018here is what I need to access this\u2019. As such they may be a good\nstep, but more work is needed to determine how they can be used to best benefit\neveryone\u2014that is, to use them in context and with distributed adaptations.\n202 A. Heath\nI will end this response by posing some questions that might help research towards\nthe goal of using Design Templates in broad contexts that can meet individual\nrequirements: \n1. What is the value of talking about groups of learners?\n2. How can we ensure Design Templates are not misused?\n3. How can Design Templates cater for repressed demand\u2014where a user may only\nselect from what is available and not know to say \u2018I want this\u2019?\n4. How can Design Templates be used across systems and organisations in ways\nthat remain responsive to real individual requirements?\nNote\n1.
