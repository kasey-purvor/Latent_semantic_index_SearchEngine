INTRODUCTION\nBy definition, a dilute atomic gas that has undergone Bose-\nEinstein condensation [1, 2, 3] has a large number of compo-\nnent particles occupying the same mode [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\nEffects associated with such a macroscopic occupation were\nfirst observed in superfluid helium and in superconducting\nmetals [9]. The importance of interactions in such com-\nparatively dense condensed-matter systems means that the\ncondensate fraction, although important, is substantially less\nthan the non-condensate fraction. In systems composed of\nlaser and magnetically cooled and trapped dilute atomic gases\n[10, 11, 12] the situation is often very different; the atomic gas\ncan be sufficiently cold and dilute for the condensate fraction\nto be a large proportion of the total number of atoms. It is for\nthis reason that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [13, 14, 15, 16],\noriginally conceived to develop a qualitative understanding of\nprocesses in superfluid helium, has achieved the status of a\nquantitatively useful description of degenerate dilute gases of\nbosonic atoms.\nThe Gross-Pitaevskii equation is essentially a classical field\napproximation to an underlying quantum field. Notwithstand-\ning its broad utility, there are many situations where a more\naccurate description is required. Superfluid to Mott-insulator\nphase-transitions in optical lattices [17], and dimer formation\nvia controlled manipulation of magnetic fields (in order to ex-\n\u2217Present address: Lehman Brothers, 25 Bank Street, London E14 5LE, United\nKingdom\nploit Feshbach resonances) [18] are topical examples of such\nprocesses. Effectively the strength of the inter-atomic interac-\ntions becomes significant to the extent that higher-order atom-\natom correlations must be more carefully accounted for, and\nfor which the standard Gross-Pitaevskii equation is inadequate\n[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\nEven apart from such extreme situations, if the non-\ncondensate fraction becomes significant, a description going\nbeyond the Gross-Pitaevskii equation must be called upon.\nTwo important situations where this may occur are: dynamics\noccurring at a (significant) finite temperature [25], of interest\ndue to the unique possibility offered by dilute Bose-Einstein\ncondensate experiments for quantitative tests of thermal field\ntheories; and dynamics leading to dynamical instabilities in,\nand hence depletion of an initially low temperature conden-\nsate [26, 27, 28], such as may well occur in experiments\n[29, 30, 31] studying chaotic and quantum chaotic dynam-\nics in Bose-Einstein condensates [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. The\ndesire to provide a relatively simple, consistent description of\ncondensate and non-condensate dynamics motivates the work\npresented here, and a form of the approach we present was a\nkey part in work carried out [38, 39, 40], to good agreement\nwith experiment [25], in order to describe excitations at finite\ntemperature of a dilute Bose-condensed gas.\nThe first recourse when wishing to go beyond the Gross-\nPitaevskii equation [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47,\n48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57] is frequently the Bo-\ngoliubov, or Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations [41, 42, 43],\nor their number-conserving variants [44, 45, 46, 47]. Par-\nticularly motivated by the desire to explain the properties\nof Bose-condensed gases at finite temperature, a number of\n2extensions have been proposed. These include generaliza-\ntions [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64] of linear response the-\nory [65, 66], stochastic interpretations of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation [67, 68, 69, 70, 71], Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov ap-\nproaches [72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78], a variety of kinetic the-\nories [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90], and a\ncumulant-based formalism [21, 91, 92, 93].\nThe description presented here is within a number-\nconserving formalism, and builds on the works of Gardiner\n[44], and Castin and Dum [45], which are essentially equiv-\nalent to each other. Symmetry-breaking formulations, which\nautomatically violate particle number conservation, have met\nwith considerable success in describing the observed proper-\nties of Bose-Einstein condensed dilute atomic gases. Here\nsymmetry-breaking is defined as the breaking of the U(1)\nglobal phase symmetry whose Noether charge is the total par-\nticle number. Technically, however, symmetry-breaking for-\nmulations require a coherent superposition of different num-\nbers of particles. One could argue that the actual particle\nnumber is only known statistically in any real experiments,\nand should be considered an ensemble average from multi-\nple realizations of the same experiment. Even given this, it\nis difficult to see how shot-to-shot number-coherences could\nbe built up. It is therefore important to understand any dif-\nferences which might appear between number-conserving and\nsymmetry-breaking formulations.\nA significant difference that does occur, in the number-\nconserving formulation presented in this paper, is the presence\nof nonlocal terms in the equations of motion for the conden-\nsate and non-condensate fractions. These arise from defining\nthe two fractions in such a way that they must be mutually or-\nthogonal. This orthogonality is not in general fulfilled if one\ndefines the condensate fraction as being the expectation value\nof a field operator, as occurs in symmetry-breaking formula-\ntions. The nonlocal terms can have a significant effect; correct\ninclusion of these terms has been observed to be crucial in ob-\ntaining good agreement between application of the number-\nconserving formulation presented in this paper [38, 39, 40],\nand the experimental study of collective excitations in a finite-\ntemperature Bose-Einstein condensate [25].\nWe consider what is effectively an expansion in powers\nof the ratio of non-condensate to condensate particle num-\nbers, rather than inverse powers of the total number of par-\nticles [44, 45]. This means that there should be signifi-\ncantly more condensate than non-condensate particles, but\nthat the condensate fraction is not necessarily assumed to be\nnearly encompassing the entire many-body system. We ar-\ngue that a second-order treatment (in the dynamical equa-\ntions of motion) is the minimum order necessary to pro-\nvide consistent condensate and non-condensate number dy-\nnamics, with exchange of particles between the fractions,\nfor a finite total number of particles. We show that such\na second-order treatment is provided by a suitably general-\nized Gross-Pitaevskii equation, coupled to the Castin-Dum\nnumber-conserving formulation of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nequations (these are modified only by the presence of projec-\ntors necessary to maintain orthogonality between the conden-\nsate and non-condensate components) [45]. The necessary\nequations of motion can be generated from an approximate\nthird-order Hamiltonian, which effectively reduces to second\norder in the steady state.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II formally de-\nscribes the many-Boson system under consideration, and de-\ntermines a suitable fluctuation operator on which to base the\nexpansion; Section III constructs an appropriate cubic approx-\nimate Hamiltonian used to generate the desired equations of\nmotion, and justifies the approximations made; Section IV\nelucidates the equations of motion detailing both condensate\nand non-condensate dynamics, systematically to zeroth, first,\nand second order in the fluctuation operators; Section V dis-\ncusses some considerations when the system is assumed to be\nin an equilibrium state; and Section VI consists of the conclu-\nsions. There then follow two technical appendices elaborating\non points made in the main text, which are included for com-\npleteness.\nII. SYSTEM PROPERTIES\nA. Model Hamiltonian\nThe starting point of the theory is the binary interaction\nHamiltonian for a system of bosons,\n\u02c6H(t) =\n\u222b\ndr \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r)Hsp(r, t) \u02c6\u03a8(r)\n+\nU0\n2\n\u222b\ndr \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r) \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r) \u02c6\u03a8(r) \u02c6\u03a8(r).\n(1)\nThe field operators obey the standard bosonic commutation\nrelations [ \u02c6\u03a8(r), \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032)] = \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032), and\nHsp(r) = \u2212 ~\n2\n2m\n\u22072 + V(r) (2)\n(where m is the atomic mass) is the single-particle Hamilto-\nnian, containing the kinetic energy and any external potential\nenergy terms.\nFor simplicity we have assumed the binary interaction to\nbe characterized by an energy-independent contact potential,\nVbin(r \u2212 r\u2032) = U0\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032), where U0 = 4\u03c0~2as\/m and as is\nthe s-wave scattering length. This is a standard approxima-\ntion for three-dimensional, cold dilute Bose gases. As is well\nknown, however, it leads to ultra-violet divergences, which\nare removed by renormalizing various quantities appearing in\nthe subsequent development of the theory. This procedure is\nwell understood and has been discussed by a number of au-\nthors (see, for example, Refs. [57, 61, 78, 91, 94, 95, 96]). It\ncan be rigorously justified, and we give a brief outline of the\nrelevant arguments in Appendix A.\nB. Condensate and fluctuation terms\n1. Single-body density matrix\nIn the same manner as Castin and Dum [45], we follow\nPenrose and Onsager [97] in defining the condensate wave-\n3function. This is in terms of the single-body density matrix\n\u03c1(r, r\u2032, t) = \u3008 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032) \u02c6\u03a8(r)\u3009(t), (3)\nwhere \u3008. . .\u3009(t) denotes an expectation value evaluated at a\ntime t. The single-body density matrix is Hermitian, i.e.,\n\u03c1(r, r\u2032, t)\u2217 = \u03c1(r\u2032, r, t), and can be decomposed into a complete\nset of eigenfunctions with real eigenvalues. As \u03c1(r, r\u2032, t) may\nbe time-dependent, these are the instantaneous eigenfunctions\nand eigenvalues, defined by the diagonal representation of the\nsingle-body density matrix at a specific time t.\nWe assume that there is one distinct eigenfunction \u03c6(r, t),\ndefined with unit norm, which has a corresponding eigenvalue\nNc(t) significantly larger than all the other eigenvalues. Thus\u222b\ndr\u2032\u03c1(r, r\u2032, t)\u03c6(r\u2032, t) = Nc(t)\u03c6(r, t) (4)\n(time arguments are used to indicate a possible explicit time\ndependence). We are free to partition the field operator into\ncondensate and non-condensate components:\n\u02c6\u03a8(r) = a\u02c6c(t)\u03c6(r, t) + \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), (5)\nwhere a\u02c6c(t) annihilates a particle in mode \u03c6(r, t), and \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t)\nis that part of the field operator \u02c6\u03a8(r) orthogonal to \u03c6(r, t). We\nrefer to \u03c6(r, t) as the condensate mode.\n2. Comparison with symmetry-breaking\nThe conventional symmetry-breaking methodology to par-\ntition the field operator into condensate and non-condensate\ncomponents assumes a finite expectation value \u03a8(r, t) =\n\u3008 \u02c6\u03a8(r)\u3009 for the field operator, and additionally considers a fluc-\ntuation term \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r, t) around this mean value [5, 6, 7, 8].\nHence, one states:\n\u02c6\u03a8(r) = \u03a8(r, t) + \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r, t). (6)\nBy definition, a fluctuation around a mean or expectation\nvalue must itself have a mean or expectation value equal to\nzero, i.e., \u3008\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r, t)\u3009 = 0. It also follows that these fluctu-\nation operators have exactly bosonic commutation relations,\ni.e.,\n[\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r, t), \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020sb(r\u2032, t)] = [ \u02c6\u03a8(r), \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032)] = \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032). (7)\nComparing the partitioned terms arising from a symmetry-\nbreaking formulation with those arising from consideration of\nthe single-body density matrix, we get\n\u03a8(r, t) = \u3008a\u02c6c(t)\u3009\u03c6(r, t) + \u3008\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t)\u3009, (8)\n\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r, t) =[a\u02c6c(t) \u2212 \u3008a\u02c6c(t)\u3009]\u03c6(r, t)\n+ [\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) \u2212 \u3008\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t)\u3009]. (9)\nTo enable a direct comparison with symmetry-breaking, we\nhave not assumed particle-number conservation, and hence\nneither \u3008a\u02c6c(t)\u3009 nor \u3008\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t)\u3009 are automatically assumed = 0. It\nis apparent that exactly which parts of the many-body system\nare designated as condensate and non-condensate, depends\non the formulation employed. One consequence is that, un-\nlike \u03c6(r, t) and \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), the terms \u03a8(r, t) and \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r, t) aris-\ning from a symmetry-breaking formulation are not, in general,\nspatially orthogonal. As can be seen from Eq. (8) and Eq. (9),\nin general they both have contributions from both \u03c6(r, t) and\n\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t).\nFrom the Penrose-Onsager [97] formulation for partitioning\nthe field operator used in this paper, it follows that those parts\nof the many-body system designated as being condensate and\nnon-condensate must always be orthogonal. It is this require-\nment that leads to higher-order (i.e., beyond Gross-Pitaevskii)\nequations of motion necessarily including nonlocal terms, not\narising in symmetry-breaking formulations. It should be em-\nphasized that this difference does not in itself imply that one\nformulation is more correct than the other, although partition-\ning the field operator into manifestly orthogonal components\ncan be a considerable convenience.\n3. Commutation relations\nFormally, the condensate mode creation operator a\u02c6\u2020c and the\nnon-condensate field operator \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) can be defined with re-\nspect to the bosonic field operator \u02c6\u03a8(r):\na\u02c6\u2020c(t) =\n\u222b\ndr \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r)\u03c6(r), (10)\n\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) =\n\u222b\ndr\u2032Q(r, r\u2032, t) \u02c6\u03a8(r\u2032), (11)\nwhere the projector Q(r, r\u2032, t) is defined to be\nQ(r, r\u2032, t) = \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032) \u2212 \u03c6(r)\u03c6\u2217(r\u2032). (12)\nIt follows that the only non-zero commutation relations in-\nvolving a\u02c6c(t), \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), and their Hermitian conjugates are:\n[a\u02c6c(t), a\u02c6\u2020c(t)] = 1, (13)\n[\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032, t)] = Q(r, r\u2032, t). (14)\nC. Fluctuation expansion\n1. Overview\nIt is a common procedure to consider a mean value of some\nobservable quantity, and to account for the observed variance\nin the values obtained from multiple runs of some real or\nhypothetical measurement procedure with a fluctuation term\n[98]. The observable quantity is then described in terms of\nits mean or expectation value, plus a fluctuation term with (by\ndefinition) zero expectation value. If the observable is a sim-\nple one-dimensional quantity, such as the vertical position of a\nclassical point-mass, then the statistics of the measured values\ncan be represented by a simple one-dimensional distribution.\nIf the fluctuations are vanishingly small, then the distribu-\ntion of a continuous variable collapses to a \u03b4-function, but\n4otherwise the distribution will have a width, which one usu-\nally describes in terms of the second-order cumulant (the vari-\nance). The scale of the fluctuations is therefore set by the\nsquare root of the variance (the standard deviation). Con-\nversely, finite fluctuations imply a finite width, and hence a fi-\nnite variance. In the case of a Gaussian distribution, all higher-\norder moments and cumulants can be described in terms of the\ndistribution\u2019s mean and variance.\nThe symmetry-breaking methodology used to partition the\nfield operator, as described in Section II B 2, is an example of\ndescribing an operator in terms of its expectation value plus\na fluctuation term. Analogues to the variance are the second-\norder cumulants [91, 98]:\n\u3008 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r) \u02c6\u03a8(r\u2032)\u3009 \u2212 \u03a8\u2217(r, t)\u03a8(r\u2032, t) = \u3008\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020\nsb(r, t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r\u2032, t)\u3009, (15)\n\u3008 \u02c6\u03a8(r) \u02c6\u03a8(r\u2032)\u3009 \u2212 \u03a8(r, t)\u03a8(r\u2032, t) = \u3008\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r, t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r\u2032, t)\u3009, (16)\ntogether with their Hermitian conjugates. As\n\u3008\n\u222b\ndr\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020\nsb(r, t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r, t)\u3009 is the number of non-condensate\nparticles, we generally consider \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8sb(r, t) to scale as the\nsquare root of the number of non-condensate particles. Note,\nhowever, that even if all second- (and higher-) order normally\nordered cumulants equal zero, there still remain purely\nquantal fluctuation terms, due to the noncommutativity of the\nfield operators.\nIf the physically relevant matrix elements of the fluctuation\nterms can be considered to be in some sense small (for exam-\nple with respect to the square root of the number of condensate\nparticles, as considered in this paper), then one can attempt an\nexpansion of the Hamiltonian [Eq. (1)] and equations of mo-\ntion in terms of products of the fluctuation terms. Terms of\nbeyond a specified order can then be discarded as negligible,\nup to the order of interest [5, 6, 7, 8, 42].\nIn this paper, we wish to carry out a comparable program,\nbut within a number-conserving formalism [44, 45, 57]. As\nthe expectation values of all particle creation and annihila-\ntion operators are (trivially) equal to zero, we cannot define\na \u201csmall\u201d fluctuation operator by taking a field operator and\nsubtracting its (zero) expectation value. An appropriate fluc-\ntuation operator that does not trivially have zero expectation\nvalue is required. The validity of such expansions is in general\nreliant upon (at least in the homogeneous limit) (Na3s)1\/2 \u226a 1\nif T = 0, and (kbT\/NcU0)(Nca3s)1\/2 \u226a 1 if (kbT\/NcU0) \u226b 1,\nwhere N is the total particle number, T is the temperature and\nkB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant [57].\n2. Number-conserving fluctuation operators\nSubstituting Eq. (5) into Eq. (4) reveals that Nc(t) = \u3008 \u02c6Nc(t)\u3009,\nwhere \u02c6Nc(t) \u2261 a\u02c6\u2020c(t)a\u02c6c(t). The eigenvalue Nc(t) is thus the\nmean number of particles in the condensate mode. Further-\nmore,\n\u3008a\u02c6\u2020c(t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t)\u3009 = 0, (17)\ni.e., there are no simple coherences between the condensate\nand non-condensate components.\nThe product a\u02c6\u2020c(t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) has much to recommend it as a\nfluctuation operator suited to a number-conserving formal-\nism. Unlike \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), its mean value is not trivially equal to\nzero in a number-conserving approach. The desired number-\nconserving fluctuation operator should be of the same magni-\ntude as \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), however.\nCastin and Dum [45], and Gardiner [44] were thus moti-\nvated to define\n\u02c6\u039b(r, t) = 1\u221a\n\u02c6N\na\u02c6\u2020c(t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), (18)\nwhere \u02c6N =\n\u222b\ndr \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r) \u02c6\u03a8(r) is the total particle number op-\nerator. Introducing the notation Nt(t) = N \u2212 Nc(t) for the\nnon-condensate fraction, and noting that a\u02c6c(t) should scale\nas\n\u221a\nNc(t) and \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) as\n\u221a\nNt(t), it then follows that \u02c6\u039b(r, t)\nscales as\u221a\nNc(t)Nt(t)\nN\n=\n\u221a\nNt(t)\n[\n1 \u2212 Nt(t)\nN\n]\n\u2248\n\u221a\nNt(t) (19)\nfor N \u226b Nt(t). Hence, under the assumption that Nc(t) \u2248 N,\nthis operator scales satisfactorily.\nWhen considering an assembly of exactly N atoms, Eq. (17)\ndirectly implies that \u3008 \u02c6\u039b(r, t)\u3009 \u2261 0, and so \u02c6\u039b(r, t) can be con-\nsidered a simple fluctuation operator. To linear order in \u02c6\u039b(r, t)\n[45],\n[ \u02c6\u039b(r, t), \u02c6\u039b\u2020(r\u2032, t)] \u2248 [\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032, t)] = Q(r, r\u2032, t), (20)\nand\u222b\ndr \u02c6\u039b\u2020(r, t) \u02c6\u039b(r, t) \u2248\n\u222b\ndr\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r, t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) = \u02c6N \u2212 \u02c6Nc(t).\n(21)\nAgain, when considering an assembly of exactly N atoms,\nthere can be no fluctuations in the total number operator, and\nso \u02c6N \u2212 \u02c6Nc(t) can be identified with N \u2212 \u02c6Nc(t).\nWe wish to avoid making the assumption that Nc(t) \u2248 N,\ni.e., that almost all bosons are in the condensate mode, and so\nconsider a scaling proportionate to the number of condensate\natoms rather than the total number of atoms [39, 46, 47, 57].\nA possible alternative to \u02c6\u039b(r, t) [Eq. (18)] is\n\u02c6\u039bc(r, t) = 1\u221a\n\u02c6Nc(t)\na\u02c6\u2020c(t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), (22)\nfrom which the exact identities\n[ \u02c6\u039bc(r, t), \u02c6\u039b\u2020c(r\u2032, t)] = [\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032, t)] = Q(r, r\u2032, t), (23)\nand\u222b\ndr \u02c6\u039b\u2020c(r, t) \u02c6\u039bc(r, t) =\n\u222b\ndr\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r, t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) = \u02c6N \u2212 \u02c6Nc(t).\n(24)\nfollow. This strong correspondence between normal pairs of\n\u02c6\u039bc(r, t) and \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) operators appears very attractive. How-\never, the expectation value \u3008 \u02c6\u039bc(r, t)\u3009 is not guaranteed to be\nidentically equal to zero. Consequently, the operator \u02c6\u039bc(r, t)\n5cannot be treated as a simple operator-valued fluctuation. This\ncomplicates the development of a consistent expansion in\nterms of products of \u02c6\u039bc(r, t) for the determination of improved\nequations of motion.\nIn particular, the methodology introduced by Castin and\nDum [45], and employed in slightly modified form in Sec-\ntion IV of this paper, relies explicitly on \u3008d \u02c6\u039b(r, t)\/dt\u3009 \u2261\nd\u3008 \u02c6\u039b(r, t)\u3009\/dt = 0 for the development of the equations of mo-\ntion. As \u3008 \u02c6\u039bc(r, t)\u3009 is not exactly equal to zero, an equivalent\nexpression is not guaranteed to hold for \u02c6\u039bc(r, t). One could\nstill exploit the idea that \u3008 \u02c6\u039bc(r, t)\u3009 should be approximately\nequal to zero, but this would in principle require a careful ac-\ncounting of higher-order corrections to such an approxima-\ntion, for example involving Taylor expanding [ \u02c6Nc(t)]\u22121\/2 in\npowers of [ \u02c6Nc(t) \u2212 Nc(t)]\/Nc(t).\nEquation (17) tells us that a\u02c6\u2020c(t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) and any scalar mul-\ntiple thereof has expectation value exactly equal to zero. In\norder to avoid such complications as described above, we thus\nchoose to carry out an expansion in terms of\n\u02dc\u039b(r, t) = 1\u221a\nNc(t)\na\u02c6\u2020c(t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t). (25)\nThe normal \u02dc\u039b(r, t) pair is related to the normal \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t) pair\nvia\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032, t) \u02dc\u039b(r, t) =\n\u02c6Nc(t) + 1\nNc(t) \u03b4\n\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032, t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), (26)\nand the exact commutation relation is given by\n[ \u02dc\u039b(r, t), \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032, t)] =\n\u02c6Nc(t)\nNc(t) Q(r, r\n\u2032, t)\n\u2212 1\nNc(t)\u03b4\n\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032, t)\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t).\n(27)\n3. Comparison of the candidate fluctuation operators\nThe operators \u02dc\u039b(r, t) and \u02c6\u039bc(r, t), in comparison to \u02c6\u039b(r, t),\nscale more straightforwardly as\n\u221a\nNt(t). In the expansion\nused in this paper, the terms that appear in the Hamilto-\nnian and equations of motion have the form of products of\n\u02dc\u039b(r, t)\/\u221aNc(t), and\/or its Hermitian conjugate [there is an\noverall factor of Nc(t) in the Hamiltonian, and an overall factor\nof\n\u221a\nNc(t) in the equations of motion for \u02dc\u039b(r, t) and \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r, t)].\nThe fluctuations must thus be small compared to the square\nroot of the number of condensate particles. In other words, the\nsmall parameter such a fluctuation expansion is\n\u221a\nNt(t)\/Nc(t)\n[45]. At the very least, greater than N\/2 particles must there-\nfore be in the condensate mode for the truncation of higher-\norder terms to be justifiable. If U0N is kept constant, then, at\nzero temperature, Nt tends to a constant value as N \u2192 \u221e (the\nquantum depletion). Hence,\u221a\nNt(t)\nNc(t) \u2192\n\u221a\nNt(t)\nN\n\u221d 1\u221a\nN\n, (28)\nand one can consider the small parameter in an expansion in\nterms of \u02c6\u039b(r, t), \u02c6\u039b\u2020(r, t) to be 1\/\u221aN [45].\nIn Sections III and IV we will include terms of or-\nder [\u221a1\/Nc(t)]k\/2 whenever we include terms of order\n[\u221aNt(t)\/Nc(t)]k\/2 (k an integer). We are obliged to do this\nif we wish to include the limiting case described by Eq. (28)\nin the formalism, although, as the non-condensate fraction in-\ncreases, the contribution of such terms relative to terms scal-\ning as [\u221aNt(t)\/Nc(t)]k\/2 decreases.\nIn Section V B we will see that a direct consequence of Eq.\n(27) being only approximately equal to [\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032, t)]\nis that a quasiparticle formulation produces quasiparticle\ncreation and annihilation operators that are only approxi-\nmately bosonic. This is equally the case for the commutator\n[ \u02c6\u039b(r, t), \u02c6\u039b\u2020(r\u2032, t)] [Eq. (20)], but not for [ \u02c6\u039bc(r, t), \u02c6\u039b\u2020c(r\u2032, t)] =\n[\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r\u2032, t)] [Eq. (23)]. A problem that therefore\narises, not present in comparable symmetry-breaking formu-\nlations, is that the desire to have a well-defined fluctuation op-\nerator does not appear to be fully compatible with the desire\nfor this fluctuation operator to induce bosonic quasiparticle\ncommutation relations.\nOne could take the view that, as non-zero corrections to\n\u3008 \u02c6\u039bc(r, t)\u3009 would only appear at a higher order than is being\nconsidered in this paper, one could equivalently consider an\nexpansion in terms of \u02c6\u039bc(r, t) up to the order of current in-\nterest [39]. This effectively erases any difference between\n\u02c6\u039bc(r, t) and \u02dc\u039b(r, t), however, and it is more straightforward,\nespecially when determining truncations of the many-body\nHamiltonian necessary to generate the equations of motion,\nto consider an expansion in terms of \u02dc\u039b(r, t) from the outset.\nIn particular, doing this avoids the complication of having to\napproximate square-root condensate number operators to an\nappropriate order in the fluctuation operators. This appears to\ncause particular complications in deriving a correct approxi-\nmate third-order Hamiltonian compatible with the equations\nof motion calculated to the corresponding order (although not\nthe approach presented in this paper, the equations of motion\ncan be deduced directly, without first determining an approx-\nimate Hamiltonian from which they should be derived, as in\nRef. [45]). This does leave somewhat open the question of\nwhat the best approach is if one wishes to extend the theory to\ninclude higher-order terms [87, 88, 89, 90].\nWe now summarize the relative merits of \u02c6\u039b(r, t), \u02c6\u039bc(r, t),\nand \u02dc\u039b(r, t). We wish to have a non-trivial fluctuation opera-\ntor that scales like \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r, t), i.e., as \u221aNt(t). Both \u02c6\u039bc(r, t), and\n\u02dc\u039b(r, t) have this property, whereas this is only true for \u02c6\u039b(r, t)\nin the limit Nt(t)\/N \u2192 0. Of \u02c6\u039bc(r, t) and \u02dc\u039b(r, t), \u02dc\u039b(r, t) is a\nsimple fluctuation operator (expectation value exactly equal to\nzero) but corresponds to not-exactly-bosonic quasiparticle op-\nerators, whereas \u02c6\u039bc(r, t) corresponds to exactly bosonic quasi-\nparticle operators, but does not have expectation value exactly\nequal to zero and is therefore not a simple fluctuation operator.\nIn this paper we have made the decision that, for the develop-\nment of the equations of motion, it is simpler to consider an\nexpansion in terms of \u02dc\u039b(r, t). In particular, this avoids the\ndifficulty of having to approximate square-root condensate-\nnumber operators in a consistent way.\n64. Fluctuation statistics\nIn a similar way to how the first manifestation of a fluc-\ntuation about a real mean value is in the variance of its cor-\nresponding distribution, for a finite number of particles, the\npresence of fluctuation operators effectively implies non-zero\nvalues for such pair expectation values as \u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032, t) \u02dc\u039b(r, t)\u3009.\nThis is, of course, with the important caveat that, as \u02dc\u039b(r, t)\nand \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032, t) do not commute, there will always be quantum\nfluctuations even if \u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032, t) \u02dc\u039b(r, t)\u3009 = 0. With an interacting\ngas, however, this situation never occurs. Treatments produc-\ning equations of motion to linear order in such a fluctuation\nterm thus inevitably lead to inconsistent number dynamics,\ni.e., population of the non-condensate component without a\ncorresponding depletion of the condensate.\nWe thus insist a priori that equations of motion should be\ntaken to quadratic order in products of the fluctuation oper-\nators \u02dc\u039b(r, t) and \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r, t). This paper lays out a quite gen-\neral framework for the development of higher-order theories\ninvolving both the condensate and non-condensate fractions.\nHowever, we also have a very specific goal, which is to deter-\nmine a minimally complicated set of equations for the self-\nconsistent treatment of condensate and non-condensate dy-\nnamics. Bearing this in mind, a straightforward simplifica-\ntion is to enforce that all possible expectation values of prod-\nucts of the fluctuation operators \u02dc\u039b(r, t) and \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r, t) are either\nzero (for odd products of fluctuation operators), or expressible\nin products of pair expectation values. This is essentially a\nGaussian approximation, i.e., one assumes that all cumulants,\nor connected correlation functions, of order greater than two\ncan be considered negligible [91]. One can in principle extend\nthis approximation to also account for the existence of higher-\norder cumulants (and hence higher-order correlations). The\nquantitative validity of such an approximation will depend on\nthe specific dynamics under consideration.\nThis in turn implies that the the many-body Hamiltonian\n[Eq. (1)] should be approximated to cubic order in the fluctu-\nation operators [Eq. (25)]. This is the minimum order neces-\nsary to produce equations of motion to quadratic order, and it\nis not our intention in this paper to account for any terms of\nany higher-order.\nIII. CONSTRUCTION OF A THIRD-ORDER\nHAMILTONIAN\nA. Transformation of the full Hamiltonian\nUntil now, every term with an explicit time-dependence has\nbeen shown with a t argument. From now on we neglect\nthis, but it should be remembered that \u03c6(r), \u02dc\u039b(r), Nc, \u02c6Nc, and\nQ(r, r\u2032), all are in general explicitly time-dependent.\nOne can readily transform the many-body Hamiltonian of\nEq. (1), by everywhere expanding the field operators accord-\ning to Eq. (5), and then collecting terms to produce products\nof \u02dc\u039b(r). Defining \u02dcU = U0Nc, the result of carrying this out is:\n\u02c6H =Nc\n\u02c6Nc\nNc\n\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u03c6\u2217(r)Hsp(r)\u03c6(r) + (\n\u02c6Nc \u2212 1)\nNc\n\u02dcU\n2\n|\u03c6(r)|4\n]\n+\n\u221a\nNc\n\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u03c6\u2217(r)Hsp(r) \u02dc\u039b(r) + H.c.\n]\n+\n\u221a\nNc \u02dcU\n\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u03c6\u2217(r)|\u03c6(r)|2\n\u02c6Nc \u2212 1\nNc\n\u02dc\u039b(r) + H.c.\n]\n+\n\u222b\ndr \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)\n[\nNc\n\u02c6Nc\nHsp(r) +\n\u02c6Nc \u2212 1\n\u02c6Nc\n2 \u02dcU |\u03c6(r)|2\n]\n\u02dc\u039b(r)\n+\n\u02dcU\n2\n\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u03c6\u2217(r)2 \u02dc\u039b(r)2 + H.c.\n]\n+\n\u02dcU\u221a\nNc\n\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u03c6\u2217(r) \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) Nc\n\u02c6Nc\n\u02dc\u039b(r)2 + H.c.\n]\n+\n\u02dcU\nNc\n\u222b\ndr \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)2 N\n2\nc\n\u02c6Nc( \u02c6Nc \u2212 1)\n\u02dc\u039b(r)2,\n(29)\nwhere the terms are arranged in ascending order of products\nof the fluctuation operators \u02dc\u039b(r) and \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r).\nEquation (29) is an exact reformulation of Eq. (1); note,\nhowever, that \u02dc\u039b(r) cannot be straightforwardly expanded in\nterms of exactly bosonic quasiparticle operators (see Section\nV B), and formulating the many-body Hamiltonian in terms of\nbosonic quasiparticle operators can be of great utility in deter-\nmining, for example, energy spectra to high order in a consis-\ntent fashion [57]. It is relatively straightforward to determine\nan equivalent formulation to Eq. (29) in terms of \u02c6\u039bc(r) [Eq.\n(22)], although this introduces square-root number-operator\nterms\n\u221a\n\u02c6Nc, which can be awkward to deal with.\nAs, in the steady state, the highest-order Hamiltonian\nconsidered in this paper is effectively only second-order in\nthe number-conserving fluctuation operators \u02dc\u039b(r), \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) (see\nSection IV D 4), in the present context such considerations can\nlargely be avoided.\nB. Reduction to a third-order Hamiltonian\n1.

Pragmatically, this is\nequivalent to immediately abandoning the fourth-order term\nin Eq. (29), substituting Nc for \u02c6Nc in the second- and third-\norder terms, and substituting Eq.

Gaussian approximation of the fluctuation terms\nIn the present context, a Gaussian approximation means\nthat all expectation values of products of the fluctuation op-\nerators \u02dc\u039b(r), \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) are either zero (for odd products), or ex-\npressable in terms of products of pair-averages [99]. Pragmat-\nically, in the equation of motion derived for \u02dc\u039b(r), which we\ndetermine up to quadratic order in the fluctuation operators,\nall quadratic products of \u02dc\u039b(r) and \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) must be replaced by\ntheir expectation values. Doing this guarantees, for example,\nthat a consistent Gaussian approximant to the equation of mo-\ntion for the pair-average \u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032)\u3009 is deduced directly from\nd\ndt \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032)\u3009 =\n\u2329[\nd\ndt\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)\n]\n\u02dc\u039b(r\u2032)\n\u232a\n+\n\u2329\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)\n[\nd\ndt\n\u02dc\u039b(r\u2032)\n]\u232a\n,\n(33)\nwithout there being any subsequent need for expansion of ex-\npectation values of higher-order products of the fluctuation\noperators in terms of pair-averages [91].\nAn appropriate approximate Hamiltonian \u02c6H3 consistent\nwith this desired level of approximation in the equations of\nmotion, should thus be such that the commutator [ \u02dc\u039b(r), \u02c6H3]\nproduces terms contributing to the equation of motion for\n\u02dc\u039b(r) in the desired form. This means either scalar terms to\nzeroth order in the fluctuation operators, first-order operator-\nvalued terms, or scalar second-order terms in the form of pair-\naverages. From Eq. (27) and Eq. (31) it can be seen that, to\nquadratic order,\n[ \u02dc\u039b(r), \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032)] \u2248Q(r, r\u2032)\n{\n1 +\n\u222b\ndr\u2032\u2032 \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032\u2032)\u3009\nNc\n\u2212\n\u222b\ndr\u2032\u2032\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032\u2032)\nNc\n}\n\u2212\n\u02c6\u039b\u2020(r\u2032) \u02c6\u039b(r)\nNc\n,\n(34)\nand that the first corrections appear at quartic order. To a\nGaussian level of approximation, the operator products are\nconsistently replaced by expectation values. Thus,\n[ \u02dc\u039b(r), \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032)] \u2248 Q(r, r\u2032) \u2212 \u3008\n\u02c6\u039b\u2020(r\u2032) \u02c6\u039b(r)\u3009\nNc\n. (35)\nWhen considering quadratic and cubic terms in the postulated\nthird-order Hamiltonian \u02c6H3, this commutator is simplified fur-\nther to\n[ \u02dc\u039b(r), \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032)] = Q(r, r\u2032), (36)\nas otherwise cubic and quartic terms appear in the final equa-\ntion of motion.\nHence, we deduce that the cubic fluctuation operator prod-\nucts appearing in \u02c6H3 [Eq. (32)] must be expanded into sums of\nlinear operator-valued terms multiplied by pair-averages. To\nthis degree of approximation, this is accomplished by express-\ning cubic products as the sum of all possible pair-averages,\nmultiplied by the remaining fluctuation operator. This is\nequivalent to a Hartree-Fock factorization, as described, for\nexample, in Ref. [78].\nFor example\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032\u2032) \u2248\u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032)\u3009 \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032\u2032) + \u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032\u2032)\u3009 \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032)\n+ \u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032\u2032)\u3009 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r),\n(37)\nand we deduce that factorising the cubic terms appearing in\n8Eq.

As such, it is not gen-\nerally valid; careful consideration reveals this not to be a seri-\nous problem in the present specific context, however. Hartree-\nFock-Bogoliubov factorizations have also been applied in the\nfull binary interaction Hamiltonian to both cubic and quartic\nproducts of the fluctuation operators. Work by Morgan [57]\nrevealed that factorization of the cubic products omitted terms\nwhich were as large as terms of quartic origin which were re-\ntained. We, however, have already eliminated quartic fluctua-\ntion terms from consideration, and in the steady state all cubic\nterms will also be eliminated (see Section IV D 4). If exten-\nsion of the theory to include higher-order terms is desired, this\nsimplification will need to be revisited.\nIV. EQUATIONS OF MOTION\nA. General properties of the equations of motion\n1. Explicit time dependences\nIt is convenient to have expressions describing the explicit\ntime-dependence only of a\u02c6\u2020c and \u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r).\nTaking the partial time-derivative of Eq. (10), and re-\ncalling that the bosonic field operator has no explicit time-\ndependence, we deduce that\ni~\n\u2202a\u02c6\n\u2020\nc\n\u2202t\n=\n\u222b\ndr \u02c6\u03a8\u2020(r)\n[\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r)\n]\n. (39)\nSimilarly, taking the partial time-derivative of Eq. (11) pro-\nduces\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r) =\n\u222b\ndr\u2032\n[\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nQ(r, r\u2032)\n]\n\u02c6\u03a8(r\u2032). (40)\nThe condensate mode-function \u03c6(r) is defined to have unit\nnorm, which directly implies\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6\u2217(r)\n]\n\u03c6(r) = \u2212\n\u222b\ndr\u03c6\u2217(r)\n[\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r)\n]\n. (41)\nThe resulting Eq. (41) can then be substituted into Eq. (40),\nproducing\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r) = \u2212 a\u02c6c\n\u222b\ndr\u2032Q(r, r\u2032)\n[\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r\u2032)\n]\n\u2212 \u03c6(r)\n\u222b\ndr\u2032\n[\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6\u2217(r\u2032)\n]\n\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r\u2032).\n(42)\nIn Eq. (39) and Eq. (42), we have the final forms of the\ndesired expressions.\n2. Condensate number\nThe general equation of motion for the condensate number\noperator, \u02c6Nc = a\u02c6\u2020c a\u02c6c, is\ni~\nd \u02c6Nc\ndt = [\n\u02c6Nc, \u02c6H] + i~\n\u2202 \u02c6Nc\n\u2202t\n, (43)\nfrom which the dynamics of Nc = \u3008 \u02c6Nc\u3009 are deduced by taking\nthe expectation value.\nWe first consider the explicit time dependence in isola-\ntion. Substituting Eq. (39) and its Hermitian conjugate into\n\u2202 \u02c6Nc\/\u2202t = (\u2202a\u02c6\u2020c\/\u2202t)a\u02c6c + a\u02c6\u2020c(\u2202a\u02c6c\/\u2202t) produces\ni~\n\u2202 \u02c6Nc\n\u2202t\n=\n\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u02c6Nc\u03c6\u2217(r) +\n\u221a\nNc \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)\n]\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r)\n+\n\u222b\ndri~ \u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6\u2217(r)\n[\n\u02c6Nc\u03c6(r) +\n\u221a\nNc \u02dc\u039b(r)\n]\n.\n(44)\nSubstituting in Eq. (41), we simplify Eq. (44) to\ni~\n\u2202 \u02c6Nc\n\u2202t\n=\n\u221a\nNc\n\u222b\ndr \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)\n[\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r)\n]\n+\n\u221a\nNc\n\u222b\ndr\n[\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6\u2217(r)\n]\n\u02dc\u039b(r).\n(45)\nEquation (45) is entirely composed of linear fluctuation oper-\nator terms. Hence, there is no explicit time dependence to the\ncondensate number, i.e.,\ni~\n\u2202Nc\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2329\ni~\n\u2202 \u02c6Nc\n\u2202t\n\u232a\n= 0. (46)\n9Therefore, to all orders, the entire time-dependence of the\ncondensate number follows from the (implicit) commutator\nterm of Eq. (43):\ni~\ndNc\ndt = \u3008[\n\u02c6Nc, \u02c6H]\u3009. (47)\nIn principle this can be determined directly from the appropri-\nate form of the Hamiltonian \u02c6H. If one is in any case determin-\ning the time-evolution of the individual fluctuation operators\n\u02dc\u039b(r), \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r), it is generally more convenient to note from Eq.\n(31) that Nc = N \u2212\n\u222b\ndr\u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009 to quadratic order, and\ntherefore that\ni~\ndNc\ndt = \u2212\n\u222b\ndr\n\u2329\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)\n[\ni~\nd\ndt\n\u02dc\u039b(r)\n]\u232a\n\u2212\n\u222b\ndr\n\u2329[\ni~\nd\ndt\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)\n]\n\u02dc\u039b(r)\n\u232a\n,\n(48)\nto the (quadratic) order considered here.\n3. Fluctuation operator\nWe now consider the dynamics of the number-conserving\nfluctuation operator \u02dc\u039b(r) directly. In general, the Heisenberg\ntime-evolution of the fluctuation operator is given by\ni~\nd\ndt\n\u02dc\u039b(r) = [ \u02dc\u039b(r), \u02c6H] + i~ \u2202\n\u2202t\n\u02dc\u039b(r). (49)\nWe again initially consider the explicit time-dependence of\nEq. (49), which, from the definition of the fluctuation operator\ngiven by Eq. (25), yields\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u02dc\u039b(r) = \u2212 i~\u2202Nc\n\u2202t\n1\n2Nc\n\u221a\nNc\na\u02c6\u2020c\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r)\n+\n1\u221a\nNc\ni~\n\u2202a\u02c6\n\u2020\nc\n\u2202t\n\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r)\n+\n1\u221a\nNc\na\u02c6\u2020ci~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03b4 \u02c6\u03a8(r).\n(50)\nAs there is no explicit time-dependence to Nc [Eq.

In order to determine the full dynamics to the\ndesired order, we need to know the form of the appropriate\napproximate Hamiltonian. Sections IV B, IV C, and IV D de-\nduce such Hamiltonians to first, second, and third order, re-\nspectively, as well as the associated time-evolutions implied\nby them.\nB. Reduced first-order Hamiltonian\n1. Reduction to a first-order Hamiltonian\nIn principle, one can consider a zeroth-order approximation\nto the Hamiltonian of Eq. (38). This is obtained by neglecting\nall fluctuation terms, and yields a classical energy functional\nH0 = Nc\n\u222b\ndr\u03c6\u2217(r)\n[\nHsp(r) +\n\u02dcU\n2\n|\u03c6(r)|2\n]\n\u03c6(r). (53)\nThe lowest order Hamiltonian of real interest to us is linear in\nthe fluctuation operators \u02dc\u039b(r), \u02dc\u039b(r), which is when it first has\na definite operator character. Dropping all terms of second and\nthird order in the fluctuation operators from Eq. (38) leaves the\nappropriate first-order form of the Hamiltonian:\n\u02c6H1 =Nc\n\u222b\ndr\u03c6\u2217(r)\n[\nHsp(r) +\n\u02dcU\n2\n|\u03c6(r)|2\n]\n\u03c6(r)\n+\n\u221a\nNc\n\u222b\ndr\n{\n\u03c6\u2217(r)\n[\nHsp(r) + \u02dcU |\u03c6(r)|2\n]\n\u02dc\u039b(r) + H.c.\n}\n.\n(54)\n2. Deduction of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation\nAs we are using a first-order approximate Hamiltonian to\ndeduce a zeroth-order approximate equation of motion, we\ncombine Eq. (49) with the first line of Eq.

(56), and using the fact\nthat \u3008d \u02dc\u039b(r)\/dt\u3009 \u2261 d\u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009\/dt = 0, we get the time-dependent\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, in essentially the same manner as\nCastin and Dum [45], with Nc taking the place of N ( \u02dcU =\nU0Nc):\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r) =\n[\nHsp(r) + \u02dcU |\u03c6(r)|2 \u2212 \u03bb0\n]\n\u03c6(r), (57)\nwhere\n\u03bb0 =\n\u222b\ndr\u03c6\u2217(r)\n[\nHsp(r) + \u02dcU |\u03c6(r)|2 \u2212 i~ \u2202\n\u2202t\n]\n\u03c6(r). (58)\nBy norm conservation [Eq. (41)], the scalar value \u03bb0 = \u03bb\u22170,\nand is therefore always real. Substituting Eq. (57) into Eq.\n(56) then directly implies that i~d \u02dc\u039b(r)\/dt = 0, and hence\n[through Eq. (48)] that dNc\/dt = 0, i.e., to this order, there\nis no time-dependence to the non-condensate component, and\nhence no change in the number of non-condensate atoms.\nThis is to be expected, as we are considering the system\ndynamics to zeroth order in the fluctuation operators. Thus,\nto the current order, we are ignoring the fluctuation operators\naltogether in the equations of motion.\n3. Time-independent case\nAssuming \u03c6(r) to be a steady state with respect to Eq. (57)\n(generally, although not necessarily the lowest energy steady\nstate), one derives the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation\n\u03bb0\u03c6(r) =\n[\nHsp(r) + \u02dcU |\u03c6(r)|2\n]\n\u03c6(r), (59)\nwhere \u03bb0 takes the form of a nonlinear eigenvalue, which at\nthis level of approximation can be identified with the chemical\npotential. A consequence of this is that the linear terms in the\nfirst-order Hamiltonian [Eq. (56)] can be eliminated, reducing\n\u02c6H1 to the zeroth-order form given in Eq. (53).\nC. Reduced second-order Hamiltonian\n1. Reduction to a second-order Hamiltonian\nDropping all terms cubic in the fluctuation operators, \u02dc\u039b(r)\nand \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r), from Eq.

Deduction of the modified Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations\nTo determine the equation of motion for the number-\nconserving fluctuation operator \u02dc\u039b(r) to linear order, we must\ninclude the zeroth- and linear-order terms from Eq.

This is\nequivalent to the result presented by Gardiner [44] and Castin\nand Dum [45], apart from the use of Nc rather than N.\nThe presence of the projectors is due to the fact that the\ndefinition of the condensate and non-condensate components\n[Eq. (5)] explicitly guarantees their orthogonality [43]. This\nis not true with a conventional symmetry-breaking approach.\nNote, however, that if one considers a spatially homogeneous\ncondensate density, then\ni~\nd\ndt\n\u02dc\u039b(r) =\n[\nHsp(r) + 2 \u02dcU |\u03c6(r)|2 \u2212 \u03bb0\n]\n\u02dc\u039b(r) + \u02dcU\u03c62(r) \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r).\n(64)\nwhich coincides with the conventional form of the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations [41, 42].\n3. Number evolution\nSubstituting Eq. (63), together with its Hermitian conju-\ngate, into Eq. (48) yields that the condensate number evolves\nas\ni~\ndNc\ndt =\n\u02dcU\n\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u03c6\u2217(r)2\u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r)2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)2\u3009\u03c6(r)2\n]\n. (65)\nThis equation is composed of terms quadratic in the fluc-\ntuation operators, even though we have everywhere else ne-\nglected equivalent quadratic terms. One could argue that\nthese contributions should be consistently neglected as being\n\u201csmall\u201d compared to the current (linear) order of interest. In-\nconsistencies, such as the fact that when considering a non-\nsteady-state evolution the modified Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nequations [Eq. (63)] can imply unconstrained growth of the\nnon-condensate fraction without there being any correspond-\ning effect on the condensate evolution [Eq. (57)] [26, 27, 28],\nwould then be dismissed as being due to a misguided attempt\nto use a first-order theory to determine the evolution of a\nsecond-order quantity. It is useful to examine what is going\non in a little more detail, however.\nCaveats about purely quantum fluctuations aside, finite\nfluctuations generally imply finite pair averages, as discussed\nin Section II C 1 and Section II C 4. Fluctuations assert their\nexistence by having an observable effect, through pair aver-\nages (as well as possibly higher-order connected correlation\nfunctions) [98]; for example, when determining the quantum\ndepletion [7, 8]. For a fixed, finite total number of particles\nthere is, therefore, a consistency problem intrinsic to first-\norder theories in the fluctuation operators. In Section IV D it\nwill be shown that, while extending the theory to second-order\nmodifies the equation of motion for \u03c6(r), it does not change\nthe form of the equations of motion for \u02dc\u039b(r) [Eq. (63)], and\nhence Nc [Eq. (65)]. As will be described in Section IV D 5, in\nan infinite particle limit (Nc \u2192 \u221e while Nt remains finite) the\nfirst-order equations of motion of Section IV C are recovered\nfrom the second-order equations of motion. Strictly speaking,\nthis limit is required for the first-order equations of motion to\nbe meaningful.\nWhen allowing Nc (and hence N) to tend to infinity while\nrequiring Nt to remain finite, it is preferable to consider the\ntime evolutions of Nt and Nc\/N, which are both finite. Instead\nof Eq. (65), we then have\ni~\nd\ndt\n(Nc\nN\n)\n= \u02dcU\n\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u03c6\u2217(r)2 \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b(r)2\u3009\nN\n\u2212 \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)2\u3009\nN\n\u03c6(r)2\n]\n,\n(66)\nwhich tends to zero on the right-hand-side as N \u2192 \u221e, and\ni~\ndNt\ndt =\n\u02dcU\n\u222b\ndr\n[\n\u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r)2\u3009\u03c6(r)2 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217(r)2\u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r)2\u3009\n]\n, (67)\nwhich does not. Within this limit it is perfectly legitimate to\nuse Eq. (67) to determine the time-evolution of the number\nof non-condensate particles; change in Nt then corresponds to\nan infinitesimal fractional change in Nc. Conversely, Nc\/N =\n1 \u2212 Nt\/N \u2192 1, and so the time-derivative in Eq. (66) must\nlogically be zero.\nSuch a limit is not appropriate for the desired self-consistent\npropagation of condensate and non-condensate dynamics with\na fixed, finite total particle number N, for which the full\nsecond-order treatment described in Section IV D is neces-\nsary.\n12\n4. Time-independent case\nAs in Section IV B 3, we substitute the time-independent\nGross-Pitaevskii equation [Eq. (59)] into the second-order\nHamiltonian [Eq.

The equation\nof motion can then be written as:\ni~\nd\ndt\n\u02dc\u039b(r) =[ \u02dc\u039b(r), \u02c6H3] \u2212\n\u221a\nNc\n\u222b\ndr\u2032\n[\nQ(r, r\u2032) \u2212 \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009\nNc\n]\n\u00d7\n[\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r\u2032)\n]\n\u2212 \u03c6(r)\n\u222b\ndr\u2032\n[\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6\u2217(r\u2032)\n]\n\u02dc\u039b(r\u2032)\n+\n\u222b\ndr\u2032\u03c6\u2217(r\u2032)\n[\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r\u2032)\n]\n\u02dc\u039b(r).\n(70)\nTo produce a consistent second-order equation of motion, we\nmust now include the quadratic correction to the fluctuation\noperator commutator, using the full form given by Eq.

Effectively this means that\nwe use the full form of the commutator when determining the\ntime-dependence due to terms of Eq. (69) that are linear in the\nfluctuation operators.

(74)\nWe can eliminate the time-derivative on the right-hand side\nof Eq. (72) by iterative resubstitution, keeping only terms of\nup to the appropriate order. This is equivalent to substituting\nin the lower-order equation of motion for \u03c6(r), i.e., the Gross-\nPitaevskii equation [Eq. (57)]. Doing this produces\ni~\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u03c6(r) =\n{\nHsp(r) + \u02dcU\n[(\n1 \u2212 1\nNc\n)\n|\u03c6(r)|2 + 2 \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009\nNc\n]\n\u2212 \u03bb2\n}\n\u03c6(r) + \u02dcU\u03c6\u2217(r) \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b(r)2\u3009\nNc\n\u2212 \u02dcU\n\u222b\ndr\u2032|\u03c6(r\u2032)|2\n[ \u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009\nNc\n\u03c6(r\u2032) + \u03c6\u2217(r\u2032) \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b(r\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009\nNc\n]\n,\n(75)\nthe final form of the generalized Gross Pitaevskii equation\n(formally, in conjunction with its complex conjugate, to which\nit is coupled). This is essentially as was used by Morgan [39]\nto explain finite temperature effects on the excitation spec-\ntrum measured in the JILA 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate\nexperiment [100]. The anomalous average \u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r)2\u3009 must be\nappropriately renormalized to avoid ultraviolet divergences\n[57, 61, 78, 91, 94, 95, 96], as is briefly sketched in Appendix\nA.\nIn Ref. [45], Castin and Dum choose to describe the con-\ndensate mode in terms proportional to inverse powers of the\ntotal particle number, i.e., as\n\u03c6(r) = \u03c60(r) + 1\u221a\nN\n\u03c61(r) + 1N \u03c62(r) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (76)\nThe zeroth-order term \u03c60(r) is then propagated by the Gross-\nPitaevskii equation [Eq. (57), but Castin and Dum formally\nhave \u02dcU = U0Nc replaced by U0N]. The first-order term \u03c61(r)\nis equal to zero [as described in Section IV C 2, there are no\nfirst-order corrections to the time evolution of \u03c6(r)]. Equa-\ntions (95) and (96) of Ref. [45] describe the time-evolution\nof the component of \u03c62(r) orthogonal to \u03c60(r), which are cou-\npled to the motion of \u03c60(r) propagated by the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. Combining these equations appears to be equivalent\nto substituting \u03c6(r) = \u03c60(r) + \u03c62(r)\/N into Eq. (75), dropping\nterms in \u03c62(r) considered to be of too high an order, and re-\nplacing 1\/Nc with 1\/N. We have found it simpler to consider\nthe evolution of a unified \u03c6(r) directly, and the deduction of\nEq. (75) is a significant step toward the paper\u2019s main result.\nNoting that\n\u222b\ndr\u2032Q(r, r\u2032)\u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032)\u3009 = \u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009 and\nthat similarly\n\u222b\ndr\u2032Q(r, r\u2032)\u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032)\u3009 = \u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009, we\nsee that substituting Eq. (72) into Eq. (71), the equation of\nmotion for \u02dc\u039b(r), causes all terms not linear in the fluctua-\ntion operators to vanish. This is basically equivalent to the\nremoval of the zeroth-order terms when deducing the modi-\nfied Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in Section IV C 2.\nOne can again substitute Eq. (75) for i~\u2202\u03c6(r)\/\u2202t where it\nappears in what remains of Eq. (71), neglecting all higher or-\nder terms; note, however, that this is equivalent to substituting\nin the simple Gross Pitaevskii equation [Eq. (57)]. This leaves\nus with the same modified Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations\n[Eq. (63)] as determined previously, in Section IV C 2.\nThe generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation [Eq. (75)], to-\ngether with the modified Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations\n[Eq. (63)] thus describe the second-order coupled condensate\nand non-condensate dynamics, respectively. This states the\n14\nmain result of the paper.\nIt should be emphasized that the evolution predicted by the\nmodified Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations may be very differ-\nent if it is coupled to the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equa-\ntion [Eq. (75)] rather than the simple Gross-Pitaevskii equa-\ntion [Eq. (57)]. That this may constitute a more consistent\ntreatment is shown by the fact that, just as there is an action\nof the condensate normal and anomalous density terms on the\ntime-evolution of the number conserving fluctuation operators\n[Eq. (63)], there is a corresponding back action of the normal\nand anomalous pair-averages on the time-evolution of the con-\ndensate mode [Eq. (75)].\nA similar generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation can be de-\nrived within a symmetry-breaking context [78], but without\nthe integral term on the second line of Eq. (75). Before\ndiscussing the role of this term, we note that the projectors\nQ(r, r\u2032) in the modified Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations [Eq.\n(63)] can be expanded to give\ni~\nd\ndt\n\u02dc\u039b(r) =\n[\nHsp(r) + 2 \u02dcU |\u03c6(r)|2 \u2212 \u03bb0\n]\n\u02dc\u039b(r) \u2212 \u03c6(r)2 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) \u2212 \u02dcU\n\u222b\ndr\u2032|\u03c6(r\u2032)|2\n[\n\u03c6\u2217(r\u2032)\u03c6(r) \u02dc\u039b(r\u2032) + \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032)\u03c6(r\u2032)\u03c6(r)\n]\n. (77)\nThose parts of the integral terms of Eq. (75) and Eq. (77) en-\nclosed within square brackets are of almost identical form, but\nwith the roles of the condensate mode functions and the fluc-\ntuation operators exchanged. A comparably elegant simplifi-\ncation of notation afforded by use of the projectors in Eq. (63)\nis not obvious for Eq. (75). The function of the integral terms\nin Eq. (77) and Eq. (75) is equivalent, however \u2014 to ensure\nthat the orthogonality of the condensate and non-condensate\ncomponents is maintained [45]. Hence, their explicitly nonlo-\ncal form, and the consequence that both integral terms vanish\nin the limit of a spatially homogeneous condensate density.\nThe appearance of such a term at this order is necessar-\nily in conjunction with the coupling of the generalized Gross-\nPitaevskii equation [Eq. (75)] to the fluctuation operator nor-\nmal and anomalous densities. This is unlike the case in\nSection IV C, where the result of the simple time-dependent\nGross-Pitaevskii equation [Eq. (57)] feeds into the modified\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations [Eq. (63)], but the Gross-\nPitaevskii equation itself evolves in complete isolation.\n3. Number evolution\nAs the time-evolution of the number-conserving fluctua-\ntion operators, \u02dc\u039b(r) and \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r), is still given by the modified\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations [Eq. (63)], the condensate-\nnumber evolution must still be given by Eq. (65). Note, how-\never, from Eq. (74), that the number dynamics can also be cast\nas\ndNc\ndt =\n\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb\u22172\ni~\nNc. (78)\nThis has the form of a simple linear differential equation. The\n(time-dependent) rate of growth or decay of the number of\ncondensate particles is equal to the difference between the cre-\nation of pairs of condensate particles in conjunction with the\nannihilation of pairs of non-condensate particles, and the re-\nverse process.\nThe significance of this result is that the condensate-number\nevolution equation directly implied by the third-order Hamil-\ntonian contains no terms of higher than second-order in the\nnumber-conserving fluctuation operators, which is consistent\nwith the order of those fluctuation-operator terms appearing in\nthe generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. This is the lowest\nnon-trivial order at which such a consistent description is pos-\nsible for a finite number of particles [101]. One might have\nexpected higher-order fluctuation operator terms to be neces-\nsary in the non-condensate evolution for a treatment consis-\ntent with the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation [75]. This\nis not so; consistent number dynamics in fact require that there\nbe no extension to the modified Bogoliubov-De Gennes equa-\ntions [Eq. (63)].\n4. Time-independent case\nIf we assume a steady state for \u03c6(r), then the [equivalent\nto Eq. (59)] time-independent generalized Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation is given by\n\u03bb2\u03c6(r) =\n{\nHsp(r) + \u02dcU\n[(\n1 \u2212 1\nNc\n)\n|\u03c6(r)|2\n+ 2 \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009\nNc\n]}\n\u03c6(r) + \u03c6\u2217(r) \u02dcU \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b(r)2\u3009\nNc\n\u2212\n\u222b\ndr\u2032\n[ \u3008 \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009\nNc\n\u02dcU |\u03c6(r\u2032)|2\u03c6(r\u2032)\n+ \u03c6\u2217(r\u2032) \u02dcU |\u03c6(r\u2032)|2 \u3008\n\u02dc\u039b(r\u2032) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009\nNc\n]\n.\n(79)\nSubstituting this back into Eq. (69), all linear and cubic-order\nterms disappear. This is analogous to the way all linear-order\nterms disappeared in the derivation of the second-order time-\nindependent Hamiltonian, and the elimination of these terms\nleaves us with the same form of time-independent Hamilto-\nnian [Eq. (68)].\n5. Infinite-particle limit\nExamination of Eq. (75) and Eq. (77) reveals that allowing\nthe number of condensate particles to arbitrarily increase, i.e.,\n15\nNc \u2192 \u221e, causes all higher-order terms present in the gen-\neralized Gross-Pitaevskii equation to vanish, leaving the sim-\nple Gross-Pitaevskii equation [Eq. (57)], whereas the modified\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations are unchanged.\nWe thus reduce exactly to the first-order formulae gained\nusing an approximate second-order Hamiltonian [Eq. (60)].\nWhen one considers that a treatment using the modified\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations [Eq. (63)] coupled to the\nsimple Gross-Pitaevskii equation [Eq. (57)] allows for unlim-\nited growth of the non-condensate fraction without there being\nany effect on the condensate dynamics, it is clear that only in\nthe limit of an infinite number of condensate particles can the\ndynamics predicted by these equations be strictly correct.\nV. EQUILIBRIUM PROPERTIES\nA. Overview\nSection V B recaps the situations described by Gardiner\n[44] and Castin and Dum [45], which, in addition to work by\nGirardeau and Arnowitt [46, 47], sought to provide a number-\nconserving equivalent to the symmetry breaking Bogoliubov\nformalism [41, 42]. That is, considering the Hamiltonian to\nsecond order in the fluctuation terms, or equivalently, equa-\ntions of motion of up to first order in the fluctuation terms. In\nthe present context, this is equivalent to assuming the correct-\nness of Eq. (57) and Eq. (63). Having set context and notation,\nSection V C considers some of the difficulties in going beyond\nthis level of approximation.\nB. Quasiparticle formulation\n1. Two-component representation\nAs the time-evolution of the number-conserving fluctuation\noperator \u02dc\u039b(r) [Eq. (63)] causes it to couple to its Hermitian\nconjugate, it can be convenient to write the coupled time-\nevolution equations in a unified two-component form.

(87)\nNote that L(r\u2032, r) = L\u2217(r, r\u2032), i.e., L is Hermitian, and thus\nL(r, r\u2032) has some symmetry properties which J(r, r\u2032) does\nnot [45].\nInserting the projectors Q(r, r\u2032) into Eq.

Having pop-\nulated the system appropriately, one can determine the time-\nevolution of the fluctuation operators from a system initially\nat equilibrium purely through the mode functions, such that\ni~\nd\ndt\n(\nuk(r)\nvk(r)\n)\n=\n\u222b\ndr\u2032L(r, r\u2032)\n(\nuk(r\u2032)\nvk(r\u2032)\n)\n, (102)\nand the \u02dcbk, \u02dcb\u2020k are constant.\nC. Further considerations\nAs has been shown in Section IV C 4 and Section IV D 4,\n\u02c6H3 and \u02c6H2 have the same form if the system is in equilib-\nrium [Eq. (68)], meaning that Eq. (98) is an equally valid re-\nformulation of \u02c6H3 in an equilibrium context. A concern is\nthat use of the more complete formulation of the commutator\n[Eq. (35)] reveals that the quasiparticle commutation relations\nare not exactly bosonic [Eq. (94) and Eq. (95)]. If we recall\nthat, in conjunction with second-order terms, we have always\nused the simpler form of the commutator, in the context of the\npresent paper this does not seem to be a critical consideration.\nExtending this approach to a consistent higher-order formal-\nism, as is in principle desirable, will present some difficulties,\nhowever.\nWe could take slightly different operators, defined from\n\u02c6\u039bc(r), \u02c6\u039b\u2020c(r) [Eq. (22)],(\n\u02c6\u039bc(r)\n\u02c6\u039b\n\u2020\nc(r)\n)\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nk=1\n\u02c6bk\n(\nuk(r)\nvk(r)\n)\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nk=1\n\u02c6b\u2020k\n(\nv\u2217k(r)\nu\u2217k(r)\n)\n. (103)\nAs a consequence of the commutation relation described in\nEq. (23), the commutation relations of \u02c6bk and \u02c6b\u2020k are exactly\nbosonic, and therefore could potentially better describe the\nsystem in terms of a Bose-Einstein distribution. This would\nbe more in keeping with the spirit of the detailed treatment,\nmaking use of second-order perturbation theory, given in Ref.\n[57].\n17\nAs described in Section II C, \u02c6\u039bc(r) is not a simple fluctu-\nation operator. In other words, its expectation value is not\ndefined to be exactly equal to zero. The formal development\nof the equations of motion in Section IV explicitly relies on\nthe number-conserving fluctuation operator having expecta-\ntion value equal to zero. Hence, using \u02c6\u039bc(r), which has ex-\npectation value only approximately equal to zero, would mean\nthat corrections, particularly at higher order, would have to be\ncarefully calculated and accounted for. Furthermore, the idea\nthat one is looking at fluctuations about a well defined mean,\nand that the magnitude of these fluctuations is observed, in\nthe first instance, through pair expectation values, possibly to\nbe followed by a well-defined hierarchy of connected correla-\ntion functions or cumulants, is muddied. In other words, an\nimprecision in the procedure used to determine the relevant\nequations of motion is introduced at a basic level. It therefore\ndoes not seem that a demand for such precision is compatible\nwith defining perfectly bosonic quasiparticle operators.\nIt should be emphasized that this is not a comment over\nwhether it is more correct to use either \u02c6\u039bc(r) or \u02dc\u039b(r). Hav-\ning an expectation value exactly equal to zero, and inducing\nexactly bosonic quasiparticle commutation relations, are both\nhighly desirable properties for a hypothetical fluctuation oper-\nator to have. Within the formal framework used in this paper,\nfor a finite total number of particles, it seems that one has\nchoose which of these properties is the more important for the\npurpose at hand. The emphasis in this paper is on the formal\ndevelopment of the relevant equations of motion. For this, at\nleast, describing things in terms of \u02dc\u039b(r) and \u02dc\u039b\u2020(r) seems to\nbe more convenient. For other purposes, it may be more ap-\npropriate to consider a formulation closer to \u02c6\u039bc(r) and \u02c6\u039b\u2020c(r)\n[57].\nGood results have been achieved, using the equations of\nmotion developed in this paper, in describing excitations in fi-\nnite temperature Bose-Einstein condensate by Morgan [39].\nWe also note that such issues as potentially imperfectly-\nbosonic quasiparticle operators are largely avoided if the ini-\ntial system has a negligible non-condensate fraction, even if\nsubsequent dynamics (for example investigations of chaotic\ndynamics [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]) can\ncause significant depletion [26, 27, 28], hence requiring the\nkind of self-consistent treatment presented here.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a coupled system of\nequations, the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the\nmodified Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation are the necessary\nminimally complete description to imply internally consis-\ntent number dynamics for a finite total number of particles.\nIn other words, dynamics such that only particles lost from\nthe condensate fraction are assumed by the non-condensate\nfraction, and vice-versa. Elaboration of the (linear) modified\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations is neither desirable nor nec-\nessary, as this would automatically lead to inconsistent num-\nber dynamics. That an approach to second order in the fluctu-\nation operators is necessary is directly implied by elementary\nstatistical considerations; effectively that a finite fluctuation\ndirectly implies a finite variance, or its equivalent. Hence, in\nan infinite particle limit the first-order approach, consisting of\nthe simple Gross-Pitaevskii equation coupled to the modified\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations, is recovered. It is only in\nthis limit that the dynamics predicted by this system of equa-\ntions are technically consistent. A similar form of the ap-\nproach presented here has been employed [38, 39, 40] as a\nkey component of an analysis of the observed excitations in\nfinite temperature Bose-Einstein condensates, to good agree-\nment with experiment [25]. The formalism presented here\nis also suitable for the study of dynamically unstable Bose-\nEinstein condensate dynamics, where, even if the sample is\ninitially at zero temperature, it is possible for a sizable non-\ncondensate fraction to build up over time.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank K.

(75)] con-\ntains the anomalous average \u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009, which is ultra-violet\ndivergent. We give a brief summary of the reason and cure for\nthis problem [57, 61, 78, 91, 94, 95, 96].\nThe divergence arises from of the use of the contact poten-\ntial approximation. A genuinely ab initio theory would start\nby describing particle interactions using the true two-body po-\ntential. The contact \u201cpotential\u201d is rather the zero-momentum\nlimit of the two-body T-matrix describing the scattering of two\nparticles in vacuum. It is introduced at the outset [Eq. (1)]\nfor a number of reasons: partly for convenience, partly be-\ncause this is the experimentally relevant quantity, and partly\nbecause it makes sense to include as much two-body physics\nas possible before embarking on a difficult many-body calcu-\nlation. We certainly cannot treat the two-body interaction with\nperturbation theory. This is apparent from the fact that the in-\nteractions can be described by a contact potential dependent\nonly on a scattering length, whereas a perturbative treament\nwould depend on the details of the potential [102].\nHowever, this does mean that we have implicitly included\nat the outset various physical effects which must also appear in\nthe many-body treatment. To avoid double-counting we need\nto subtract off the perturbative approximation to the two-body\neffects whenever we encounter them.\nThe leading order interaction term is the nonlinear term in-\nvolving the condensate. The interaction strength U0 in this\nexpression must now be replaced by the second order approx-\nimation, i.e., the \u02dcU in \u02dcU |\u03c6(r)|2\u03c6(r) must be replaced in Eq.\n18\n(75) by \u02dcU + \u2206 \u02dcU\/Nc, where\n\u2206 \u02dcU =\n\u02dcU2\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u222b\nd3k m(~k)2 , (A1)\nand \u2206 \u02dcU\/N2c is the second order correction to the interaction\nstrength as calculated from the Lippmann-Schwinger equa-\ntion. This correction can be grouped with the term in the\ngeneralized Gross-Pitaevskii equation [Eq. (75)] involving\nthe anomalous average. This leads to a finite renormalized\nanomalous average m\u02dcR(r), defined by\nm\u02dcR(r) = \u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009 + \u2206\n\u02dcU\n\u02dcU\n\u03c6(r)2. (A2)\nIt should therefore be implicitly assumed that the anoma-\nlous average \u3008 \u02dc\u039b(r) \u02dc\u039b(r)\u3009 appearing in Eq. (75) is replaced\nby m\u02dcR(r) to produce a consistent, renormalized generalized\nGross-Pitaevskii equation.\nAPPENDIX B: SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION OF L(r, r\u2032)\nThe treatment described in this appendix echoes that of\nCastin and Dum [45], and is included for the sake of com-\npleteness.\nWe assume that (uk(r\u2032), vk(r\u2032)) is a right eigenstate of the\noperator L(r, r\u2032) defined in Eq. (85), with eigenvalue \u01ebk. This\nis equivalently stated by\u222b\ndr\u2032L(r, r\u2032)\n(\nuk(r\u2032)\nvk(r\u2032)\n)\n= \u01ebk\n(\nuk(r)\nvk(r)\n)\n. (B1)\nDecomposing this two-component equation into the top and\nbottom elements then reveals, directly,\u222b\ndr\u2032L(r, r\u2032)uk(r\u2032) +\n\u222b\ndr\u2032M(r, r\u2032)vk(r\u2032) = \u01ebkuk(r), (B2)\u222b\ndr\u2032M\u2217(r, r\u2032)uk(r\u2032) +\n\u222b\ndr\u2032L\u2217(r, r\u2032)vk(r\u2032) = \u2212\u01ebkvk(r).\n(B3)\nTaking the complex conjugates of the above equations then\nyields\u222b\ndr\u2032L\u2217(r, r\u2032)u\u2217k(r\u2032) +\n\u222b\ndr\u2032M\u2217(r, r\u2032)v\u2217k(r\u2032) = \u01eb\u2217k u\u2217k(r), (B4)\u222b\ndr\u2032M(r, r\u2032)u\u2217k(r\u2032) +\n\u222b\ndr\u2032L(r, r\u2032)v\u2217k(r\u2032) = \u2212\u01eb\u2217k v\u2217k(r).\n(B5)\nCombining Eq. (B4) and Eq. (B3) then yields a \u201cleft-hand\u201d\nform of Eq. (B1):\u222b\ndr(u\u2217k(r),\u2212v\u2217k(r))L(r, r\u2032) = \u01eb\u2217k (u\u2217k(r\u2032),\u2212v\u2217k(r\u2032)). (B6)\nWe now choose a normalization convention for the two-\ncomponent eigenstates such that\u222b\ndr[|uk(r)|2 \u2212 |vk(r)|2] = 1. (B7)\nHence, applying Eq. (B6) onto a right eigenstate, where we\ncan choose whether L(r, r\u2032) should act to the right [Eq. (B1)]\nor the left [Eq. (B6)], reveals that\n\"\ndrdr\u2032(u\u2217k(r),\u2212v\u2217k(r))L(r, r\u2032)\n(\nuk(r\u2032)\nvk(r\u2032)\n)\n= \u01ebk = \u01eb\n\u2217\nk , (B8)\ni.e., the eigenvalue \u01ebk is real.\nThus, (u\u2217k(r),\u2212v\u2217k(r)) is the corresponding left eigenstate,\nwith eigenvalue \u01ebk, to the right eigenstate appearing in Eq.\n(B1).\nFurthermore, Eq. (B4) and Eq. (B3) imply that the complex\nconjugate of a right eigenstate is also a right eigenstate:\u222b\ndr\u2032L(r, r\u2032)\n(\nv\u2217k(r\u2032)\nu\u2217k(r\u2032)\n)\n= \u2212\u01ebk\n(\nv\u2217k(r)\nu\u2217k(r)\n)\n(B9)\nNow, in an equivalently manner to the derivation of Eq. (B6),\nfrom Eq. (B2) and Eq. (B5) we deduce that\u222b\ndr(\u2212vk(r), uk(r))L(r, r\u2032) = \u2212\u01ebk(\u2212vk(r\u2032), uk(r\u2032)), (B10)\ni.e., that (\u2212vk(r), uk(r)) is the corresponding left eigenstate,\nwith eigenvalue \u2212\u01ebk, to the right eigenstate appearing in Eq.\n(B9).\nAs the eigenstates have different eigenvalues, they are or-\nthogonal, i.e.,\u222b\ndr[u\u2217k\u2032(r)uk(r) \u2212 v\u2217k\u2032(r)vk(r)] =\u03b4kk\u2032 , (B11)\u222b\ndr[uk\u2032(r)vk(r) \u2212 vk\u2032 (r)uk(r)] =0 (B12)\nWe note that setting uk(r) = \u03c6(r) and vk(r) = 0 on the one\nhand, and v\u2217k(r) = 0 and u\u2217k(r) = \u03c6\u2217(r) on the other, produces\ntwo eigenstates of eigenvalue zero.\nThe identity can thus be decomposed as\n\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032)\n(\n1 0\n0 1\n)\n=\n(\n\u03c6(r)\n0\n)\n(\u03c6\u2217(r\u2032), 0) +\n(\n0\n\u03c6\u2217(r)\n)\n(0, \u03c6(r\u2032))\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nk=1\n(\nuk(r)\nvk(r)\n)\n(u\u2217k(r\u2032),\u2212v\u2217k(r\u2032))\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nk=1\n(\nv\u2217k(r)\nu\u2217k(r)\n)\n(\u2212vk(r\u2032), uk(r\u2032)),\n(B13)\nand, similarly, L(r, r\u2032) can be expressed as\nL(r, r\u2032) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=1\n\u01ebk\n(\nuk(r)\nvk(r)\n)\n(u\u2217k(r\u2032),\u2212v\u2217k(r\u2032))\n\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nk=1\n\u01ebk\n(\nv\u2217k(r)\nu\u2217k(r)\n)\n(\u2212vk(r\u2032), uk(r\u2032)).\n(B14)\nThis is the usual form of the spectral decompositions of the\noperator L(r, r\u2032) [45]. The two-component modes involving\nthe condensate mode [which are also eigenstates of L(r, r\u2032)]\ndo not explicitly appear as they have eigenvalue zero.\n19\n[1] S. N. Bose, Z.

From the the present work, it does\nnot appear that this quartic term should be included at this level\nof approximation. In the context of Ref. [39], its effect is, in\nany case, negligible.\n[101] Trivially, the zeroth-order dynamics predicted by the first-\norder Hamiltonian described in Section IV B) can also be con-\nsidered consistent in this sense, as there is no evolution of the\nfluctuation operators \u02dc\u039b(r), and hence no change in Nc.\n[102] This becomes apparent, for example, when considering dimer\nformation by making use of a Feshbach resonance.
