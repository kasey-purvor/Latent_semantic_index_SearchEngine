ISSN 0308-518X \n \n \nLocal and regional development policies have become increasingly popular in response to the \nterritorial challenges generated by economic globalisation. The unprecedented pace of the spatial \nre-organisation of economic activity has questioned the capability of the pre-existing top-down \npolicy paradigm to deal with these new challenges (Pike et al., 2006). \u2018Bottom-up\u2019 local and \nregional development policies have been called into action in order to fill-in this operational \nvacuum. By empowering local actors and making them directly responsible for the design of their \nown collective response to the new challenges, bottom-up policies have often been regarded as an \neffective alternative to traditional approaches to development. Policy-makers needed ready-\navailable and easily-manageable tools to deal with the new global scenario and bottom-up policies \nseemed to be able to provide them with suitable answers. Bottom-up Local Economic \nDevelopment (LED) policies have been adopted in developed and (to a lesser extent) developing \ncountries with little questioning of their theoretical justifications\/foundations and little \nunderstanding of the factors conditioning their success. In other words, the traditional top-down \npolicy apparatus grounded in solid macro and micro economic theories has been complemented (or \neven replaced) by a new policy approach whose theoretical foundations remain, at best, implicit. \nLED policies have lacked a clear conceptual framework not only for the diagnosis of local \nconditions and for the identification of the most appropriate remedies, but also for the ex-post \nassessment of their impact. Academic research has tried to fill this conceptual void by looking at \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

An \ninductive approach has hence dominated the analysis of bottom-up policies, constraining not only \nthe \u2018generality\u2019 of any conclusion and policy lessons \u2013 the \u2018often-mindless groping for \u201cbest \npractice\u201d\u2019 discussed by Markusen and Schrock (2006) \u2013 but also a priori jeopardising any synergies \nwith top-down policies and their foundations grounded into \u2018general\u2019 deductive macro theories of \ndevelopment.  \n \nHowever, over the past few years, the literature on economic development policies has evolved in \nsuch a way that the distance between inductive and deductive perspectives has shrunk. On the one \nhand, the literature on local and regional development has developed sound \u2018meso-level\u2019 analytical \ntools which combine inductive and deductive perspectives on local and regional development \ndynamics. On the other, the macro-economic approach to development has made significant steps \ntowards becoming more open to inductive reasoning and, hence, to the consideration of local \nspecificities.  \n \nThis commentary aims to show how the foundations of top-down and bottom-up development \npolicies can be reconciled in a joint \u2018meso-level\u2019 conceptual framework which can serve \nsimultaneously as a deductive justification for bottom-up local and regional development policies \nand as a coordination device between different policies.  \n \nTowards an \u2018integrated\u2019 framework for top-down and bottom-up policies \nWhen looking at the literature that has inspired and guided local and regional economic \ndevelopment policies, the separation between macro and micro economic (deductive) theories, \nbehind top-down development policies, and \u2018meso-local\u2019 (inductive) concepts, informing bottom-up \ndevelopment strategies, is immediately apparent.  \n \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

ISSN 0308-518X \n \n 3 \nMicro-economic analysis has shaped top-down micro-policy options aiming to influence the \nallocation of labour and capital, while macro-economic approaches have provided the rationale for \ntop-down macro-policy options targeting aggregate regional income and expenditure. In \naccordance with the predictions of their underlying theories the aim of these policies \u2018is to induce \ncapital and labour to locate in areas which would not normally have been chosen by those making \nthe location decision\u2019 (Armstrong and Taylor 2000:234). Conversely, bottom-up policies have \naddressed \u201cthe naturally occurring sources of economic potential growing from within localities \nand regions\u201c (Pike et al. 2006:155). They target the drivers of economic performance brought to \nlight by meso-theories of innovation and growth by looking at \u2018territorial\u2019 and \u2018relational\u2019 assets \nincluding local institutions and networks (e.g. Regional Systems of Innovation), social capital, and \nlocalised tacit knowledge. As far as the empirical informative basis for the design (and evaluation) \nof these policies is concerned, top-down policies have been traditionally informed and evaluated by \nmeans of quantitative\/econometric analyses, while bottom-up policies by means of (almost \nexclusively) qualitative case-study-based evidence. The upper and lower parts of Figure 1 show \nprecisely this situation. Macro and micro economic literature provide the theoretical framework \nand quantitative analysis the informative input for top-down policies (upper part of Figure 1), \nwhile meso-level regional analysis and more qualitative studies constitute the basis for bottom-up \napproaches (lower part). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

Our tenet is that this separation is the result of the \nlack of a common theoretical and conceptual ground. There is thus a need to cross-fertilise macro-, \nmicro- and meso-level approaches to development by combining them in an \u2018integrated \nframework\u2019, which could become a powerful analytical tool for the understanding of \u2018real-world\u2019 \ninnovation and growth dynamics. This \u2018integrated approach\u2019 could provide a common conceptual \nbackground for both top-down and bottom-up policies. By conceptualising both inter-regional \nexternal processes (in the form of spillovers) and internal indigenous factors \u2013 justified in light of \neither macro linear approaches (R&D efforts) or meso-level theories (Regional Systems of \nInnovation) \u2013 we are able to account for bottom-up policies as part of an interactive and \ninterconnected geography of localities (giving rise to spillovers) and, at the same time, for top-\ndown policies, rooted in heterogeneous territories (in terms of their indigenous characteristics). \nSuch an integrated approach allows us to identify developmental factors as targets for both top \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

Quantitative results from regression analyses can thus be \nseen as stylised representations of the processes they address and the \u201cregularities\u201d they highlight, \nand while robust, they need to be complemented by an understanding of the residual (unexplained) \nheterogeneity of each individual case. As an example, the lessons of the innovation systems \napproach go precisely in this direction and lead us to consider the complexity of the relationship \nbetween innovation and growth, taking into account that the interaction among actors happens in \n\u201ceminently contextualized conditions\u201d (Cantwell and Iammarino 2003 p.11), as \u201cuntraded \ninterdependencies\u201d and informal knowledge flows (Storper, 1995).  \n \nTranslating the territorial \u2018integrated\u2019 approach into a diagnostic\/policy tool \nOnce we assume the need for an \u2018integrated\u2019 conceptual framework for both top-down and \nbottom-up policies, how can it be translated into practical policy prescriptions? Existing economic \nliterature has extensively attempted to identify practical targets for development policies, \n\u2018translating\u2019 different theories into policy-guidance frameworks. In international macro-\ndevelopment literature, the \u2018growth diagnostics\u2019 (Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco 2008; Rodrik \n2010) approach develops a \u2018practical\u2019 framework for growth-enhancing policies by adopting a \nsimilar perspective to the integrated framework presented in this commentary. This approach is \nthe result of the \u2018eclectic\u2019 cross-fertilisation of different theories of regional innovation and \ngrowth. \u2018Growth diagnostics is based on the idea that not all constraints [to economic growth and \ndevelopment] bind equally, and that a sensible and practical strategy consists of identifying the \nmost serious constraint(s) at work (p.6) (\u2026) and remove them with locally suited remedies. \nDiagnostics requires pragmatism and eclecticism, in the use of both theory and evidence. It has no \nroom for dogmatism, imported blueprints, or empirical purism\u2019 (Rodrik 2010: 7). However, \nexisting works based on the \u2018growth diagnostics\u2019 approach, even if attentive to local \ncharacteristics, are still grounded in macro theories of development, remaining silent about the \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

Conversely, in the \nplanning and regional development literature a number of works have explicitly provided (both \nqualitative and quantitative) analytical support for bottom-up local development policies. Research \non \u2018regional benchmarking\u2019 (Huggins 2009a and b) seeks \u201cto understand regional contexts and \npromote improved regional innovation and competitiveness outcomes\u201d (Huggins 2009a: 275) by \ncomparing their performance, processes, and policies in a systematic fashion. These analyses have \naccumulated an impressive stock of knowledge on various aspects of regional economies which can \nsupport the diagnosis of local economic conditions making inter-regional comparisons possible (as \nwith the integrated framework discussed in this paper). They also offer a definition of \u2018measurable\u2019 \npolicy targets. However, the capability of these exercises to support policy-making is constrained \nby the lack of a sound underlying conceptual framework justifying a particular choice of indicators \nand accounting, not only for their qualitative differences and relative importance in different \ncontexts, but also for their functional relationships. Other contributions have moved their focus \nfrom \u2018benchmarking\u2019 into the explicit search for the \u2018drivers\u2019 of \u2018regional competitiveness\u2019. Kitson \net al. (2004) critically review this literature spanning from Porter\u2019s competitive advantage \ndiamond (and subsequent variations on the theme) to the progressively more sophisticated \nacademic attempts by, for example, Budd and Hirmis (2004) or Wong (2002) and highlight the \nweaknesses which hamper their suitability to devise policy interventions. From a \u2018growth \ndiagnostic\u2019 perspective, the lack of coherence in the theoretical justification of the various drivers \nof competitiveness \u2013 Kitson et al. (2004) suggest that \u2018different theories seem to be implicit in \ndifferent drivers\u2019 (p. 996) \u2013 is not per se problematic. However, it becomes misleading \u2018whereby it \nis assumed that the same \u2018drivers\u2019 are equally important everywhere, and hence the same basic \npolicy model is applicable\u2019 (p.996), as this contradicts the growth diagnostic logic and paves the \nway to imitation of best practices that overlook the \u2018(often subtle) interdependencies that exist \nbetween the different factors contributing to a successful model\u2019 (Boschma 2004: 1011). \n \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

ISSN 0308-518X \n \n 7 \nTranslating the \u2018integrated framework\u2019 for regional and local innovation and growth discussed \nabove into a conceptual toolkit for (bottom-up and top-down) development policies represents an \nattempt to show how filling this double gap in the literature is possible (central section of Figure \n1). An \u2018integrated approach\u2019 can first bring the \u2018growth diagnostic approach\u2019 into regional and \nlocal policy-making by grounding the diagnosis in the literature focused on regional-territorial \nprocesses (central, left-hand side section of Figure 1). By cross-fertilising theories rather than \nsimply linking-up indicators (as in most of the literature on regional competitiveness), clear, \nmeasurable, theoretically-grounded targets for local and regional policies can be identified. This \nimplies grasping \u2018the logistics of the relationships between (these) different socioeconomic factors \nin the development process\u2019 (Wong 2002:1833) and producing a more accurate picture of the local \neconomy for locally suited remedies (central, right-hand side section of Figure 1). The arrows in \nFigure 1 show the convergence of all these factors in an integrated framework: a regional \u2018growth \ndiagnostics\u2019 approach allows us to use this framework as a tool for the identification of policy \ntargets and locally-suited remedies while our theory-driven \u2018regional benchmarking\u2019 enables the \ncollection of information simultaneously relevant for both top-down and bottom-up policies  \n \nA diagnostic policy tool for locally-suited economic development policies \nHow is this \u2018integrated approach\u2019 translated into policy? There are five keystones of regional and \nlocal economic development in the \u2018integrated\u2019 framework: innovative activities, socio-economic \n(social filter) conditions, geographical factors\/accessibility, international (trans-local) linkages, \nand local and regional policies. They are presented in Figure 2. These factors can be seen as key \nregional assets\/liabilities that benefit\/hamper local firms and business, and hence are major \naspects of regional competitive advantage\/disadvantage (Kitson at al. 2004). \n \n \n \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

In quantitative \nterms they work as inputs in the Knowledge Production Function for the generation of new ideas \nlater translated into economic growth. However, from a qualitative perspective, innovative \nactivities can be pursued in different contexts \u2013 as discussed in Crescenzi et al. 2007 when \ncomparing Europe and the US \u2013 with different roles being played by private firms, research \ncentres, and universities. The impact of innovative activities crucially depends upon two other \nfactors: socio economic conditions and geography. The concept of \u2018Social filter\u2019 (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, \n1999) \u2013 the structural socio-economic pre-conditions for the development of a well-functioning \nRegional System of Innovation \u2013 can be adopted as a quantitative proxy for the presence\/absence \nof innovation prone or innovation averse local institutions, making inter-regional and inter-\ntemporal comparisons and benchmarking possible. However, bottom-up, the assessment of the \n\u2018social filter\u2019 can be complemented using qualitative considerations capturing its institutional and \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

In Figure 2, the arrows show the functional links \nbetween the various components of our diagnostic framework. The social filter is assessed in \nrelation to innovation as it shapes the translation of innovative efforts into economically-viable \nknowledge and economic growth. The same reasoning applies to geography. Exposure to \nknowledge spillovers is an important predictor for the economic success of a region. Two \nmechanisms are crucial in promoting this interaction: highly localised intra-regional contacts \n(density) and inter-regional connections (accessibility) (Crescenzi 2005). But the generation of \nspillovers is also a dynamic (often qualitative) process. Changes in density are influenced by the \nqualitative features of the underlying inflows of productive factors. For example, the attraction \nand agglomeration of highly skilled individuals has different implications for local economic \nperformance when compared to the sedimentation of low-skilled individuals. Similarly, the impact \nof improvements in regional accessibility resulting from transport infrastructure investments is \nheavily influenced not only by other local characteristics (i.e. other keystones in Figure 2), but also \nby the qualitative features of specific infrastructure projects. Micro-analyses have emphasized how \ninsufficient accessibility may not only be the result of \u2018physical\u2019 barriers or lack of infrastructure, \nbut also of bottlenecks or network failures that can only be identified by means of a qualitative \nassessment of the constraints to local accessibility. Geography \u2013 as suggested by the arrows in \nFigure 2 \u2013 is directly linked to innovative activities and socio-economic conditions in shaping \ninnovation and growth performance. Accessibility to innovative spaces determines the potential \nexposure to knowledge spillovers  and facilitates their absorption (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Crescenzi \n2008).  \n \nInnovation and growth dynamics are, however, not only influenced by physical accessibility: the \nposition of each region in the \u2018global networks\u2019 structure and its exposure to knowledge flows is \nalso important for the diagnosis of local conditions. The capability of local actors to develop \norganisational, institutional, and social proximity relations with other agents determines the \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

The \u2018degree of centrality\u2019 of \neach region in these networks can be assessed in quantitative terms (e.g. by looking at patent \ncitations or FDI flows), but the design of bottom-up policies also requires a qualitative case-by-\ncase understanding of the nature of non-local links and of their supportive forces. Participation in \nglobal networks exerts an influence on all of the developmental \u2018keystones\u2019 mentioned above. \nGlobal nodes\/actors (e.g. Multinational Firms) located in the regions will benefit from and \ncontribute to the Regional System of Innovation and, more generally, to the socio-institutional \nenvironment in their search for untradeable assets (Cantwell and Iammarino 2003). Spillovers will \ntake place between local and global actors channelling \u2018global\u2019 knowledge into the local \nenvironment and \u2018pumping\u2019 the results of local innovative efforts into global knowledge pipelines \n(Bathelt et al. 2004; Coe and Bunnell 2003). Geographical accessibility is also a catalyst for the \nlocalisation of global networks given that good accessibility attracts the location of these \u2018nodes\u2019 \nby reinforcing exposure to internal localised spillovers generated by indigenous activities with the \naccessibility to extra-regional knowledge flows. \n \nFinally, any top-down or bottom-up assessment of a regional economy is incomplete without \nconsidering (pre)existing development policies which, initiated and implemented at different levels \n(from national policies to community-level initiatives), impact upon the local economy (Pike et al., \n2007). These policies can be targeted towards one or more of the \u2018keystones\u2019 of local economic \ndevelopment: policies at all levels can address \u2018systemic\u2019 social filter conditions, \nincentivize\/support R&D activities or try to increase the \u2018centrality\u2019 of the region in geographical \n(e.g. by means of improvements in transport infrastructure) or social\/organisational\/institutional \nterms (e.g. by promoting international cooperation among firms and\/or universities or by means \nof incentives for the location of Multinational Firms or other \u2018global\u2019 actors).  \n \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

ISSN 0308-518X \n \n 11 \nThe simultaneous and reciprocal interaction of these five factors (Figure 2) determines how \nregions produce innovation and grow. When these interactions are synergetic (i.e. all drivers of \nlocal economic development work in the same direction), the growth potential of the local \neconomy is maximised. Good economic performance is also possible when some factors work in \norder to compensate for the weaknesses of others.  Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Crescenzi (2008) have \nshown that innovation can be achieved even in the presence of sub-optimal R&D efforts provided \nthat social filter conditions and exposure to spillovers is sufficiently strong. Conversely, \ninnovation and growth are hampered in regions where one or more of these factors are \npersistently weak or where they tend to check each other. This happens, for example, when \nphysical accessibility is increased without a prior reinforcement of internal socio-economic \nconditions, leaving the local economy exposed to external competition without fully developing its \nindigenous potential. Good governance and well-functioning institutions allow synergies to \nprevail \u2018endogenously\u2019. However, local and regional development policies can certainly help the \nestablishment of balanced development patterns where this is not the case.  \n \nIf these five factors are analysed using quantitative methods, they may serve as targets for top-\ndown policies by allowing inter-regional comparisons (e.g. for opportunity\/cost assessment in the \nuse of available resources) and a clear pinpointing of policy targets. Conversely, when the factors \nin Figure 2 are approached using qualitative techniques, they work as diagnostic tools for local \neconomic conditions and as drivers for bottom-up policies. In this perspective the \u2018integrated \nframework\u2019 becomes a common ground for both top-down and bottom-up policy actions that \nmakes their coordination easier. Bottom-up and top-down policies are governed by different \npolitical processes and collective action dynamics involving a different balance between efficiency \nand equity issues: while top-down regional policies have been traditionally concerned with a \nmixture of aggregate efficiency and territorial equity, bottom-up approaches have been essentially \nconcerned with local efficiency. However, increasing constraints in terms of public finance have \nCrescenzi, Riccardo and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s (2011) Reconciling top-down and bottom-up development policies.

The majority of the theoretical and \nempirical literature that forms the foundations of our integrated framework has been developed \nwith reference to countries, regions, and territories in the \u2018developed\u2019 world. As a consequence the \nanswer to the question \u2018What can we learn for developing countries?\u2019 remains largely unexplored. \nEven if increasingly popular in the developing world (Nel 2001), it is in Europe and the United \nStates that local and regional development policy tools have been applied for a sufficiently long \nperiod of time and with enough quantitative and qualitative information to allow a consistent \nassessment of their effects and potential drawbacks. As a consequence, the abandonment of a \u2018best \npractice\u2019\/case study approach and developing sound conceptual framework for the analysis of \nregional and local innovation and growth dynamics, provides us with the necessary (though not \nsufficient) conceptual tools to understand what of the \u2018developed world\u2019 policy experience can be \nsuccessfully transferred into \u2018developing\u2019 and emerging economies (and under what conditions). \nThe re-design and re-conceptualisation of the framework presented here, in line with the specific \nfeatures of emerging economies, is in our agenda for future research together with the necessary \nvalidation by means of quantitative empirical analysis. We share Scott and Storper\u2019s (2003) view \nthat: \u2018as globalization and international economic integration have moved forward, older \nconceptions of the broad structure of world economic geography as comprising separate blocs \n(First, Second and Third Worlds), each with its own developmental dynamic, appear to be giving \nway to another vision.
