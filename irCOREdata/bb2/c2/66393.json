We\nhave discovered a saturating component of the magnetisation, which we attribute to previously\nunobserved interactions between magnetic excitons. These conclusions are confirmed by muon\nspin spectroscopy which indicates an ordering temperature of 50K in both the transverse\nand zero-field configurations. Low-energy muon measurements demonstrate that the magnetic\nbehaviour is independent of implantation energy and hence a property of the bulk of the\nmaterial. The magnetic exciton formation is attributed to the interaction between electrons\nbound at oxygen vacancies and neighbouring cobalt ions, and is proposed as the precursor to\nthe magneto-electronic phase separation recently observed in doped lanthanum cobaltite.\nIntroduction. \u2013 LaCoO3 is unique among the LaMO3 family (where M is a transition\nmetal element) as it undergoes a thermally driven spin state transition. This occurs because\nthe crystal-field splitting of the d-levels of the Co3+ ions is only slightly greater than Hund\u2019s\nexchange energy, leading to a situation where a small input of thermal energy can lead to the\noccupation of a higher spin state. Explicitly, a transition from a Co3+ low spin (LS) S = 0,\nt2g\n6eg\n0, state to an intermediate spin (IS) S = 1, t2g5eg1, state occurs at around 90K, al-\nthough the exact nature of the transition is still a matter of some contention [1\u20139]. However,\nthe low-temperature (T < 35K) magnetic properties of LaCoO3 are usually dominated by a\nCurie-like magnetic susceptibility, which is generally acknowledged to be related to defects.\nIn particular, this \u201cCurie tail\u201d has been ascribed to paramagnetic impurities, ferromagnetic\nregions at the surface [10], and also to the formation of high spin (S = 16) magnetic polarons\nin LaCoO3 [1]. Nagaev et al. [11] have also proposed that the paramagnetic centres responsible\nfor the Curie tail are magnetic polarons, although strictly they should be labeled \u201cmagnetic\nexcitons\u201d. In this model localized holes (electrons) bound to cobalt ions or oxygen interstitials\nc\u00a9 EDP Sciences\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.edpsciences.org\/epl or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1209\/epl\/i2004-10519-4\n678 EUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n(vacancies) induce LS to high-spin (S = 2) transitions in neighboring Co3+ ions leaving the\nremaining cobalt ions in the LS ground state. The radius of a magnetic exciton will extend\nover several unit cells, creating spin clusters of S = 10 to 15 which are dilute within the solid.\nThe creation of the spin clusters is independent of the thermally excited LS-IS transition.\nMoreover, Nagaev et al. [11] have predicted that magnetic exciton formation is the precur-\nsor for magneto-electronic phase separation at high hole (electron) densities. Such a phase\nseparation has been observed in LaCoO3 doped with divalent cations such as Sr [12, 13] and\nCa [14]. The nature of a magnetic polaron or exciton implies that it may be most easily ob-\nserved in a system displaying a diamagnetic ground state, making LaCoO3 an ideal candidate\nto study such an defect-driven magnetic state. In this letter we report the first measurements,\nto our knowledge, of the low-temperature muon-spin spectrum of LaCoO3. This technique is\nsensitive to local magnetism, and so can in principle probe localized entities such as magnetic\npolarons. We argue that the observed magnetic response from LaCoO3 is consistent with the\nformation of magnetic excitons. The existence of magnetic excitons in LaCoO3 could well be\nrelated to the formation of magnetic polarons in other families of oxide materials.\nBulk Muon Spin Rotation or Relaxation (\u00b5SR) experiments were performed at the PSI in\nSwitzerland upon the instrument Dolly. \u00b5SR is well suited to the exploration of local magnetic\ncorrelations as the spatial sensitivity of the probe decreases rapidly, giving an effective sam-\npling radius of 20 A\u02da. The energy of the incoming muons (4MeV) means a bulk implantation\ndepth of approximately 0.5mm. We have also utilised the Low Energy Muon (LEM) beamline\nat the PSI [15], enabling depth profiling (from 20 nm to 160 nm) of the muon spin relaxation.\nKnowledge of the muon stopping site is required to fully understand the relaxation of the\nmuons. We have made ab initio electronic structure calculations to obtain the position of the\nmuon at the time of its decay, using the CASTEP density functional theory code [16] to exam-\nine the electron density. A detailed discussion of CASTEP as a tool to describe muon implan-\ntation will be given elsewhere. Complementary bulk magnetic measurements were performed\nusing a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magnetometer, all measurements were performed\nwhilst warming from 2K\u2013300K in fields up to 50 kOe. Measurements have been carried out\non both polycrystalline and single-crystal samples, fabricated by a solid-state reaction [13] and\nfloating zone furnace methods, respectively. Iodometric titration measurements on the poly-\ncrystal sample reveal a formula unit of LaCoO2.98\u00b10.02, indicating a slight oxygen deficiency.\nBulk \u00b5SR measurements. \u2013 To our knowledge, \u00b5SR has not been used to observe a\npure LS (where S = 0) to IS transition, where the contribution to the muon relaxation\nis from one source: the valence electrons of the cobalt ions. Previous measurements have\nconcentrated upon Spin-Peierls [17, 18] or Spin Crossover [19, 20] materials. For the present\ncase of LaCoO3, our calculations predict that the fractional co-ordinates of the implanted\nmuon within a rhombohedral 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 unit cell is [0.405, 0.463, 0.530]. This corresponds to\na neutral position away from the atoms, meaning that any nuclear spin component will be\ndominated by the valence electron contribution from cobalt ions. Note that the muons will be\ninfluenced by the behaviour of more than one cobalt ion. Our bulk \u00b5SR measurements were\nperformed on a single-crystal sample and initially made in a 100Oe Transverse Field (TF).\nThe data were fitted over the entire temperature range using a relaxation function of the form\nGx(t) = Astf exp\n[\n\u2212 (\u03bbstf t)2\n]\ncos(2\u03c0\u03bd\u00b5t) +A\nf\ntf exp\n[\n\u2212\n(\n\u03c3ftf t\n)2]\n, (1)\nwhere Astf and A\nf\ntf are the initial asymmetries of, respectively, the oscillatory and Gaussian\ncomponents, where s and f are for slow and fast relaxing components. \u03bbstf and \u03c3\nf\ntf are the\ndepolarisation rates for the two separate decays and \u03c5\u00b5 is the muon precession frequency,\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.edpsciences.org\/epl or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1209\/epl\/i2004-10519-4\nS.

The LS-IS spin transition is clearly\nvisible. The molar susceptibility measured at 50 kOe of the single crystal is also shown for comparison.\nFig. 2 \u2013 Temperature dependence of the depolarisation (\u03bbstf ) rate of the TF data, showing clear\nevidence for a magnetic ordering at 50K in the LS state. A Gaussian (\u03c3ftf ) contribution is apparent\nbelow 90K.\nwhich is dependent upon the externally applied field; no other function was required to fit the\nTF data. The temperature dependence of the fitting parameters Astf , \u03bb\ns\ntf and \u03c3\nf\ntf are shown\nin figs. 1 and 2. Above 90K, only the first term in eq. (1) is required to fit the muon spin\nrelaxation data; below 90K, both terms in eq. (1) are required. The initial asymmetry (Astf )\nof the oscillating decay shows evidence for a strong dephasing upon reducing temperature\n(fig. 1), coincident with the LS-IS transition as demonstrated by the 50 kOe Field Cooled\n(FC) and measured, molar susceptibility also shown in fig. 1.\nThe drop in the initial asymmetry with decreasing temperature is accompanied by the\nappearance of the second Gaussian component, \u03c3ftf , of the muon spin relaxation as illustrated\nin fig. 2. This suggests that the LS-IS is observed in Aftf because a fraction of the muons are\nnow relaxing in a magnetic region of the material that only exists when the material enters\nthe LS state. Also shown in fig. 2 is the depolarisation rate \u03bbstf as a function of temperature.\nThe peak in \u03bbstf indicates magnetic ordering at 50K, below the LS-IS transition. Previous\nmeasurements have revealed that the thermal expansion coefficient increases dramatically\naround 50K [4], although the heat capacity [21] does not show a similar evolution. The change\nin expansion coefficient was interpreted as evidence for thermally induced spin transition\nwithin the Co d-levels. We believe this an unlikely cause of the observed peak in \u03bbstf as any\neffect of thermal expansion would also be observed in \u03c3ftf .\nTo clarify the origin of the observed magnetic ordering, we have also carried out Zero\nField (ZF) \u00b5SR at temperatures representative of the three different magnetic regimes of this\nmaterial; i) above the 90K spin state transition, ii) near the magnetic ordering transition at\n55K and iii) in the impurity \u201cparamagnetic tail\u201d at 35K. The raw data are shown in fig. 3\nand a clear change in the initial asymmetry is seen to take place upon reducing temperature.\nThe muon spin relaxation curves were fitted with a function of the form:\nGz(t) = Aszf exp\n[\n\u2212 (\u03bbszf t)\u03b2\n]\n+Afzf exp\n[\n\u2212\n(\n\u03c3fzf t\n)2]\n(2)\nwhich represents a superposition of Gaussian and stretched exponential relaxations.

LaCoO3 was cooled in various\nmagnetic fields until 50K and then zero-field cooled and measured in the remnant field, with saturation\noccuring at 500Oe. A clear sign of remnance in the LS region is observed. The inset shows the effect of\nmeasuring the molar susceptibilities of the sample at 50 kOe (open squares) and 10Oe (closed circles).\nrepresents the initial asymmetries of the relative relaxations, \u03c3fzf is the depolarisation rate for\nthe Gaussian relaxation and \u03bbszf represents the depolarisation for the stretched exponential,\nwhere \u03b2 is the exponent.\nWhen in the IS phase (i)), where the majority of Co3+ ions have a spin state of 1, we find\nthat the relaxation is fitted best with the first term of eq. (2), with \u03b2 = 2, i.e. a Gaussian\nrelaxation. When in the LS state (ii)) we find that the data is again best fitted with only the\nstretched exponential function, but now with \u03b2 = 0.5, indicative of a dilute spin system with\na single relaxation time \u03c4 [22]. We find a depolarization rate that tracks the TF data, with\na 50K peak at 0.52MHz. The inclusion of the extra Gaussian component in Gz(t) is only\nrelevant when the first component indicates ordering and the paramagnetic tail in the magnetic\nsusceptibility becomes dominant in the temperature region below 45K (iii)). This can clearly\nbe seen in the inset of fig. 3, where the temperature dependence of the depolarization rate of the\nmuons, \u03c3fzf (from the fast relaxation term in eq. (2)), shows a sharp increase at 45K. We have\napplied longitudinal fields up to 4900Oe at 35K and 55K, and for both temperature regions we\nfailed to fully decouple the relaxation, which is an indication of dynamic random local fields.\nWe have observed the LS-IS transition at 90K with TF \u00b5SR and have detected magnetic\nordering at 50K in TF and ZF \u00b5SR data. The observed relaxations cannot be explained by\nthermal expansion as already discussed and they are not due to muonium formation, as the TF\nmeasurements did not demonstrate the characteristic precession frequencies for paramagnetic\nmuonium. Moreover, we observed two different relaxations below 90K in both ZF and TF\ntechniques which suggest the presence of Co ions with S > 0. It is generally accepted that pure\nLaCoO3 is expected to produce an S = 0 ground state, therefore we would expect the magnetic\nfraction of the material to become more dilute below 90K. We believe that our results can only\nbe understood by considering the possibility of defect-induced magnetism within LaCoO3.\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.edpsciences.org\/epl or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1209\/epl\/i2004-10519-4\nS. R. Giblin et al.: Observation of magnetic excitons in LaCoO3 681\nBulk magnetic measurements. \u2013 We carried out d.c. magnetic susceptibility measure-\nments of single-crystal and polycrystalline LaCoO3 to investigate the defect-related mag-\nnetism within the material. Measurements made at 50 kOe reproduce earlier results reported\nin the literature [2, 4] with the LS-IS transition upon warming, along with a Curie tail. This\nis demonstrated in the inset of fig. 4 which shows the single-crystal response when Field\nCooled (FC), demonstrating the spin transition beginning around 90K along with the low-\ntemperature Curie tail. Also shown is a fit to the 50 kOe measured data as described by\nZobel et al. [4] confirming a LS-IS transition, as opposed to a LS-HS. Thus by employing\nthe same measurment protocol as others we can reproduce the published data with both our\npolycrystalline and single-crystal samples. Significantly, the published magnetic data have\nalways been taken with a large measuring field, typically 10 kOe or 50 kOe; consequently, any\nsmall-defect\u2013related features have been swamped by the bulk response to this high measuring\nfield. A much lower measuring field of 10Oe (fig. 4 inset, closed symbols) produces a dramati-\ncally different temperature-dependent susceptibility. This initial measurement shows evidence\nfor a saturating component around 50K, with the large paramagnetic Curie-like dependence\ndominating below 35K.\nFurther investigation of the saturating component has been made with a different mea-\nsurement protocol involving field-cooling the samples to 50K in various applied magnetic\nfields, then cooling from 50K to the base temperature in the remnant field, typically 0.5Oe.\nThe resulting susceptibility was recorded upon warming in the remnant field. This cooling\nprotocol was designed to saturate the interacting component as observed in the \u00b5SR, whilst\neliminating the paramagnetic tail. The results are shown in fig. 4 for cooling to 50K in\nfields of 100Oe, 250Oe, 500Oe and 1000Oe. Clearly, the sample is showing remnant and\nsaturating behaviour (with respect to both field and temperature), with no change in the\nremnant magnetisation being detected above a cooling field of 500Oe. Note that the remnant\nmagnetisation of this extra magnetic component is very small and is easily swamped by the\nparamagnetic Curie tail at modest measuring fields. No previous results have ever observed\na remnant component of the magnetisation. Indeed, isothermal magnetisation loops down\nto 10K and up to 50 kOe demonstrate that the material appears to be paramagnetic. The\nthermally induced LS-IS transition cannot directly account for the remnant behaviour [4] and\nsuggests the defect-induced magnetism to be the cause. The SQUID magnetic measurements\nwere performed upon both single and polycrystalline samples providing the same result.\nLow-energy muon results, a depth profile. \u2013 The identity of the defects dominating the\n\u00b5SR and low-field magnetic susceptibility may be the same as those responsible for the well-\nknown Curie tail, i.e. paramagnetic impurities, ferromagnetic regions in the surface or mag-\nnetic polarons\/excitons. To address this issue we decided to probe muon spin relaxation rate\nas a function of depth (20 nm to 160 nm) with the LEM beamline at PSI. The object of this\nwork was to distinguish between bulk and surface contributions to the \u00b5SR. A large polycrys-\ntalline sample was used because of the greatly reduced muon flux. We reproduced the 100Oe\nTF bulk \u00b5SR data at a depth of 50 nm, confirming the bulk behaviour. We then performed\ndepth profiles at temperatures of 20K, 50K and 130K. The results at 50K are shown in fig. 5.\nThe main figure shows the depolarisation rate at various depths, and one can clearly see that\nit remains constant (within the error bars) over the entire depth range. The constant depo-\nlarisation is a feature of all the temperatures that we investigated, implying that the surface\nbehaves in the same way as the bulk. The inset of fig. 5 shows the asymmetry for the energy\nscan at 50K. The drop around 50 nm can be partially explained by the reflection probabilities\nat low energies [23]. Given the density of our material, we expect the asymmetry to drop by\napproximately 10 percent, but we observe a drop at all temperatures of over 20 percent.

The inset shows the drop of the initial asymmetry over the same range of\nimplantation depths, due to the reflection of muons.\npossible explanation is that an increase in the reflection probability is due to some LaCoO3\nsurface-related effect although this appears to have no impact on the bulk magnetic properties\nof the material as the asymmetry drop is temperature independent. The exact nature of the\nasymmetry drop requires further investigation. Thus we have shown that muon depolarization\noccurs throughout the material and rules out ferromagnetic surface regions as the cause of\nthe low-temperature \u00b5SR and low-field magnetic susceptibility.\nDiscussion. \u2013 Oxygen non-stoichiometry is the dominant source of defects in LaCoO3\nand are likely to effect the magnetism through the formation of magnetic excitons [11]. In this\nscenario, once the Co ions start falling into their LS state below 90K an exciton can form if\nan oxygen vacancy is contained in the unit cell and the neighbouring Co ions are also in a LS\nstate. The formation of excitons appears to occur under two distinct processes. The excitons\ncan either interact, leading to magnetic remnance or just exist as high-susceptibility large-spin\nregions. Such a model would explain the two separate relaxations observed by the TF \u00b5SR\nmeasurement (fig. 2), showing an ordering as one approaches 50K (interacting excitons) and\nanother stable component indicative of paramagnetic excitons that are polarised by the exter-\nnal field. The ZF \u00b5SR experiment is able to distinguish between the two senarios due to the\ndifference in field distribution. It can be shown that [22] \u03bb = \u03c0c2\u03b3\u00b5\u3008\u2206B2\u3009\u03c4 , where \u2206B is the\nwidth of field distribution, \u03c4 the correlation time and c is the fraction of the ions in a non-zero\nspin state for a dilute system. The stretched exponential function (slow component, \u03bbszf )\ntherefore has a maximum as the field distribution peaks due to the interacting excitons. How-\never, the non-interacting (paramagnetic) species are expected to freeze out as their fluctuation\ntime becomes large with respect to the muon time window. These independent relaxations are\nindistinguishable above 50K in the ZF configuration. When performing TF measurements,\nthe non-interacting species are frozen out by the applied external field when the excitons form\nat 90K leading to the saturated \u03c3ftf . The oxygen-vacancy-induced magnetic exciton model\ncan also explain the d.c. magnetic susceptibility data. Applying the measuring protocol as\ndescribed in the text produces remnant behaviour as shown in fig. 4. Above the ordering\ntemperature (50K), a small amount of net magnetic moment remains due to the polarisation\nof the exctions. However once the surrounding ions are excited into the IS state the exciton\nwill no longer exist and the contribution to the moment will be paramagnetic in nature.\nIn summary, this letter has described the low-temperature magnetic properties of single-\ncrystal and polycrystalline LaCoO3 probed by \u00b5SR spectroscopy.

Giblin et al.: Observation of magnetic excitons in LaCoO3 683\nS = 0 to S = 1 (LS to IS) spin transition, along with a further magnetic ordering at Tc = 50K\nin the LS diamagnetic phase. Our results indicate that the low-temperature magnetic ordering\nis associated with interacting magnetic excitons, formed as a result of the presence of oxygen\nvacancies. ZF muon spin relaxation measurements indicate the presence of dynamic relax-\nations below 90K, and confirm the existence of the magnetic ordering below 50K observed\nin the TF muon measurements. The presence of this phase was confirmed by magnetization\nmeasurements. Low-energy muon relaxation measurements have also demonstrated that the\nsurface of the sample plays no significant role in the low-temperature impurity-driven mag-\nnetic properties of LaCoO3. Therefore, we have clear evidence supporting the idea of magnetic\nphase separation in lanthanum cobaltite at low temperatures, which we attribute to oxygen-\nvacancy-induced magnetic excitons and that may be the precursor of charge and magnetic\nphase separation that is observed when the material is doped with strontium or calcium.\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nThis work was partially supported by the NMI 13 European access program and SRG would\nlike thank EPSRC for financial support. \u00b5SR experimetns were performed at the Swiss Muon\nSource, PSI, Villigen, Switzerland.
