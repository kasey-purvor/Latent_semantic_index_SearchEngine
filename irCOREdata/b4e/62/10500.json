High NK cell frequencies have been detected in human neonates, which may compensate for the relative immaturity of the specific immune response.

In this study, we examined the age distribution and phenotype of NK populations in bovine peripheral blood, including neonatal animals. We found that the NK cell populations defined by the phenotypes CD3<sup>\u2212<\/sup>CD2<sup>+<\/sup> and NKp46<sup>+<\/sup> largely overlapped, so that the majority of NK cells in bovine peripheral blood were CD3\u2212CD2<sup>+<\/sup>NKp46<sup>+<\/sup>.
