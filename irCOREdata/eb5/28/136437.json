We have analysed the relationships between the severity of Alzheimer's pathology and cognitive decline in two patient groups defined by the presence or absence of depressive symptoms.

Our results indicate that depressive symptoms did not influence cognition in the early (entorhinal) stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD; where cognition was good regardless of whether or not there was evidence for depressive symptoms) or in the late (neocortical) stages (where cognition was poor regardless of whether or not there was evidence for depression).
