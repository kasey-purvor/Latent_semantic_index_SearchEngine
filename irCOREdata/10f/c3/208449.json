It may seem odd, then, that normative theory is currently in such a healthy condition, for \nthis is supposed to be precisely such an age of consensus. Liberalism has gained an \nunprecedented ascendancy over socialism, old-style egalitarianism has fallen from favour, \npoliticians jostle for the middle ground. With so many of the traditional oppositions  - left versus \nright, direct versus representative democracy, equality versus difference - called into question, \nthis hardly seems a good time for normative theory. \n In this highly instrumental age  (when all research has to be tested by its relevance to \n\u2018user-groups\u2019) one might also anticipate a reluctance among political theorists to describe what \nthey do as normative theory. The category conjures up distinctions between \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019, \ndescriptive and prescriptive; in doing so, it threatens to give too much credibility to the \nobjectivity claims of political scientists while banishing to the periphery those otherworldly \nfigures who write about equality, freedom, or justice. No one likes to think of herself as engaged \nin what John Dunn (1996, p30) has described as the \u2018emotionally self-indulgent recycling of \ncherished political pieties\u2019; and in an era much exercised by what is possible and viable, no one \nwants to be regarded as out of touch with practical concerns. Nowadays, normative theory also \nevokes images of the complacent ideologue who mistakes local preference for universal truth, \nwho bossily intervenes to tell others what is right and wrong and fails to register the great variety \n 3 \nof ethical traditions. As we become more conscious of the ethno-centricity that shapes \neveryone\u2019s values and ideals, we are less likely to relish the description.  \n And yet normative theory carries on apace, with continuing work on issues of equality, justice \nand freedom, elaborations of older traditions such as civic republicanism, and an explosion of \nnew literature on what are seen as the challenges of diversity and difference. This is not as \ncontradictory as it seems, for as theorists free themselves from some of the earlier ideological \nstand-offs, they may be able to develop innovative arguments that bridge what used to be \nregarded as opposing camps. Rawls, most famously, developed a case for economic \nredistribution that many socialists were happy to endorse (he argued that inequalities were \njustified only when they could be shown to benefit the least advantaged), but he did this from \nwithin a self-consciously liberal framework. In Real Freedom for All, Philippe Van Parijs \n(1995) builds a socialist case for paying all members of a society an unconditional basic income, \nand does this on the basis of an argument about individual freedom. In a series of essays recently \ncollected under the title Democracy and Human Rights, David Beetham (1999) argues that the \nprocess of democratic reform is not assisted by debating whether one is \u2018for\u2019 or \u2018against\u2019 liberal \ndemocracy or elaborating what one conceives to be fundamentally different conceptions of \ndemocracy. Developing an immanent rather than external critique of liberal democracy, he \nfocuses on the core principles of political equality and popular control that underpin any \nconception of democracy, and is impatient with antitheses between direct and representative, \nmajoritarian and consensual, mass and deliberative democracy that have (in his view) hampered \nprevious debate.  \n This sense of liberation from previous dichotomies is also apparent in recent recuperations of \nrepublican thought. For much of the post-war period, theorists were required to attach \n 4 \nthemselves to either a negative or positive concept of liberty. The first (presumed to be the \nliberal one) defined freedom as the opposite of coercion, as not being prevented by others from \ndoing what we want to do. The second (associated with socialism, and putatively with totalitarian \npatterns of thought) linked freedom to self-realisation, took freedom to be possible only under \nspecific social conditions, and suggested that alienated individuals might not be the best judges \nof whether they were \u2018really\u2019 free. The 1970s gloss on this pitted a liberal-individualist \nconception of freedom as the capacity to do what one chose in one\u2019s private life against a more \npublic understanding of freedom as participation in political affairs. In recent years, both these \noppositions have been redrawn.  Philip Pettit\u2019s Republicanism (1996) delivers a \u2018third way\u2019 \nthat looks more kindly on the interventionist state as necessary to secure citizens against the \ndomination of violent husbands or unscrupulous employers, but stops short of what he regards as \nthe utopianism of participatory democracy. Quentin Skinner (1998) employs the \u2018neo-roman\u2019 \ntheory of liberty to cut through the negative\/positive dichotomy, elaborating an understanding of \nindividual freedom as crucially dependent on being a free citizen in a free state. Whether these \nmoves really do establish a third alternative remains a moot point, but the intention at least is \nclear. Instead of battling on with what are perceived as arid oppositions between liberalism and \nsocialism, contemporary theorists suggest ways of identifying inadequacies in liberalism or \nliberal democracy that do not require us to junk the tradition wholesale. \n G.A.Cohen\u2019s work is, on the face of it, an exception to this trend, for Cohen continues to \nplace himself firmly on the socialist side of any liberal\/socialist divide. But Cohen, too, has \nundergone major transformation. In a fascinating introduction to Self-Ownership, Freedom and \nEquality, he reflects on his earlier disinclination to do normative philosophy. Marxism, as he \nthen construed it, was an empirical theory about the structure of society and dynamics of history; \n 5 \nwhile the kind of theorising that involved assessing the validity of judgements on equality or \njustice seemed all too obvious to take up much of his time. (\u2018I had never heard an argument \nagainst socialism for which I did not  (so I thought) already have an answer in my pocket.\u2019 \n(1995,p4)\n \n But as the historical facts that were supposed to guarantee the transition to socialism \ndeveloped a rather different trajectory, and the challenge to egalitarianism \u2013 especially from \ntheorists like Robert Nozick - posed problems he could not so readily answer, Cohen found \nhimself almost entirely engaged by normative questions. \u2018In the past, there seemed to be no need \nto argue for the desirability of an egalitarian socialist society. Now I do little else.\u2019 (p7) \nThe description suggests he has little expectation of being forced to revise his normative \npositions (the task being to answer the difficult objections and strengthen the socialist case), and \nwhile this captures the spirit of moral advocacy that has become crucial to his work, it \nunderstates significant developments in his analysis of both Marxism and egalitarianism. Cohen \nhas been far more troubled by libertarian justifications of inequality than many of his more \nliberal colleagues; and in the process of dealing with these arguments, has incorporated into his \nunderstanding of egalitarianism what were previously considered right-wing arguments about \nresponsibility and choice. Left egalitarians, in his view, should be focusing their attention on the \nunacceptable inequalities that arise out of exploitation and undeserved \u2018bad luck\u2019. They should \nbe willing to differentiate these from the \u2018acceptable\u2019 inequalities or disadvantages that arise out \nof the exercise of personal choice.  \nIn this changed landscape, there are two sets of issues I want to address. The first relates to \nthe shifting analyses of equality. Equality is not a particularly fashionable topic in contemporary \npolitics, but has by no means dropped out of the normative literature. Work on equality has, \nhowever, bifurcated in a startling way, with most of the writing on economic equality focusing \n 6 \non the principles that should regulate the distribution of goods between individuals, and most of \nthe writing on social equality addressing patterns of oppression that regulate the relationship \nbetween marginal and dominant groups. The literature on economic equality takes issue with the \ncomplacencies of market allocations, and is far more challenging in its conception of equality \nthan the post-Thatcher consensus among party politicians; but it treats inequality primarily as a \nmatter of unfair distribution between individuals, and has become preoccupied with the \ndistinction between justified and unjustified inequalities. The literature on social or cultural \nequality (sometimes referred to as \u2018the politics of difference\u2019 or \u2018the politics of recognition\u2019) has \nbeen more concerned with inequities between groups: the persistent devaluing of people by \nvirtue of their race, gender or sexuality; the failures of equal citizenship in what are now \nmulticultural and multi-ethnic societies; the assimilationist impositions that force all social \ngroups into the self-same mould. If the first literature sometimes appears astonishingly \nindifferent to the group nature of contemporary inequality, the second often mirrors this failing \nby its lack of interest in the distribution of economic resources. The two then seem to talk past \none another.  \nThe second set of issues relates to the very status of normative theory. Contemporary \ntheorists are usually well aware of what Shane O\u2019Neill (MacKenzie and O\u2019Neill,1999, p9) \ndescribes as contingency: \u2018the fact that the main social resources that we might draw on as critics \nare the chance products of time and circumstance\u2019.  The values we affirm are inevitably formed \nwithin particular social contexts, and while we may be able to establish a universally valid \njustification that detaches these from their contingent origins, we also know how easy it is to fool \nourselves into thinking we have carried this off.  This problem becomes particularly pressing in \nthe context of a self-evident cultural pluralism, when global migration combines with global \n 7 \ncommunication to expose the latent ethno-centricity of much normative thinking. While \nliberalism is one sense triumphant, it is in other ways on the defensive, and a more jaundiced \ntake on the values of the Enlightenment (eg Gray, 1995) has generated much soul-searching \nabout the values political theorists proclaim. What then of claims to moral universalism? What is \nthe status of normative theory? \nI. Equality: Individuals or Groups? \nOver the last twenty years, egalitarians have mostly followed Cohen\u2019s recommendation about \ntaking choice and responsibility more seriously, and the majority of  those writing on economic \nequality (eg Dworkin, 1981a, 1981b; Nagel ,1979, 1991; Arneson, 1997; Miller, 1990,1995) now \nwork within a framework that seeks to distinguish between the acceptable and unacceptable \ninequalities. The defining question becomes \u2018what do individuals deserve?\u2019, the presumption \nbeing that we answer this question by establishing what was chosen and what was arbitrarily \nimposed. Is it fair, we then ask, that one individual should be so much poorer than another when \nshe was born, through no fault of her own, with a physical or mental disability? Is it fair that one \nindividual should live in more reduced circumstances than another because he was born - also \nthrough no fault of his own - on the wrong side of the tracks? Is it fair that the individual who \ninherits a powerful physique, an exquisite voice, or an extraordinary capacity for computing \nshould be able to earn so much more than the individual born with no very discernible talents? Is \nit fair (to take the somewhat more structural question posed by Cohen in his 1991 work on \nincentives) that talented rich people should hold the rest of us to ransom by threatening to work \nless if tax rates rise?  \nThe questions hark back to an argument developed by Rawls (1971) about the arbitrariness \nof birth, and the moral incoherence of saying that people deserve the fruits of what came to them \n 8 \nthrough no intrinsic merit of their own. Egalitarians have always been conscious of the injustices \nassociated with social class, and the unfair consequences of family background on people\u2019s \ndevelopment through future life. The novelty in contemporary work is that egalitarians also \nquestion the injustices associated with natural talent, with ability and talent increasingly seen as \njust a matter of good luck in the natural lottery. We surely cannot say that individuals \u2018deserve\u2019 \nthose goods that come to them through their chance location in an existing social hierarchy: the \nwealth they inherited from their parents; the educational advantages they derive from access to \nprivate schooling; the political influence they achieve through mixing in the right social class. \nBut if this is so, we also cannot say they deserve those goods that come to them by virtue of their \n\u2018natural\u2019 talents: their greater capacity for intellectual labour; their unusual gift for dreaming up \nnew inventions; their greater stamina or strength. \u2018Brute-luck\u2019 hardly counts as a justification for \ninequality. Where inequality can be justified, it must be through the choices we make.  \nThe radicalism in this is self-evident: the world we live in would be profoundly different if \nthe wealth of the rich derived only from activities for which they could claim to have been \npersonally responsible, and if those disadvantaged in the natural lottery were compensated for \ntheir relative misfortune. But as the argument has evolved, it has focused attention more and \nmore on distinctions between what is deserved and undeserved, and the emphasis on individual \nresponsibility has had a number of unfortunate effects. The first is that the separation between \nlegitimate and illegitimate inequalities generates a rather punitive frame of mind, somewhat akin \nto Victorian distinctions between the deserving and undeserving poor. Contemporary egalitarians \nwill typically say that the distribution of resources should not reflect the chance differences of \nbirth, but think it entirely right and proper that the distribution should reflect the different choices \npeople make in their lives. What then of those who make bad decisions, the short termers, for \n 9 \nexample, who had the same chances as others to insure themselves against future illness or \npoverty but opted for immediate enjoyments instead? Needs do not go away just because the \nneedy made mistakes, yet the preoccupation with distinguishing deserved from undeserved \nmisfortune can anaesthetise us to what now appears  \u2018justified\u2019 suffering. Since most of the \nundeserved misfortunes will also remain in place (no one really imagines that society is going to \nimpose a 100% inheritance tax or come up with a rewards structure that will eliminate the \nadvantages accruing to ability and talent), we may then end up with the worst of both worlds: not \nmuch modification of the natural lottery, but a new toughness towards irresponsible individuals \nwho must now live with the consequences of their mistakes.  \nA second problem is that in seeking to compensate individuals for their undeserved  bad \nfortune, egalitarians inadvertently reinforce notions about some individuals being superior to \nothers. In her recent critique of luck egalitarianism, Elizabeth Anderson argues that the focus on \n\u2018brute\u2019 bad luck as one of the main injustices to be eliminated \u2018disparages the internally \ndisadvantaged and raises private disdain to the status of officially recognized truth\u2019 (Anderson, \n1999, p306). So some are born talented, others are born stupid; some are normal, others are \ndisabled; some manage fine with their natural abilities, others will depend on systems of \nredistribution to compensate for their lack of natural assets. There seems to be an assumption \nhere that individuals are fundamentally different and that some are fundamentally better (or at \nleast better equipped) than the rest, and while this could be taken just as a statement of \nunfortunate fact, it sends a disturbingly contemptuous message to what Anderson sums up as \u2018the \ndisabled, the ugly and other victims of bad luck\u2019. Though the intention is radical \u2013 that \nindividuals should not be penalised for things that were beyond their control \u2013 the effect is more \nconservative. It is assumed that much of the inequality in the current distribution of resources \n 10 \nreally does reflect differences in ability and talent, and the main challenge has been around \nquestioning whether this process is fair. \nIt is worth contrasting this to the rather different intuition that underpins Michael Walzer\u2019s \negalitarianism: what he describes as his \u2018democratic wager\u2019 that qualities and intelligences are \nroughly distributed across the population, that no-one has a monopoly of all desirable talents, and \nthat everyone has something to offer (Walzer,1993). Where Walzer and Anderson start from a \npresumption that all individuals are worthy of equal respect - and that a systematic bunching of \nprivileges around certain people must then derive from inequitable social structures - the attempt \nto differentiate the consequences of personal choice from what is just \u2018brute\u2019 bad luck too readily \naccepts that individuals really are unequally endowed by fortune. This gives far too much \ncredence to the claims standardly made by the more successful that they got where they are by \nthe exercise of superior talents. It also leaves the less successful in the category of those to be \npitied and helped.  \nThe final point is that much of the work on economic equality treats structures of \ninequality as arising from the activities and choices of autonomous individuals. Luck and choice \nappear as the two main variables dictating the distribution of resources, and even when the luck \nelement has a self-evidently group component (like the bad luck of being born black in a society \nthat favours those who are white, or the bad luck of being born to working class parents), the \nemphasis on individual responsibility tends to play this down. The literature is full of examples \ndesigned to test our perceptions of justified and unjustified inequality: do we think it fair that the \nopera singer whose voice brings pleasure to millions is entitled to the rewards of her own good \nluck? do we think it fair that the person who plays tennis all day should get less than the \nneighbour who diligently grows vegetables in her garden? do we think surfers are entitled to a \n 11 \nbasic income? The cumulative effect is to obscure those structural inequalities that cannot be \nunderstood in such individualist terms. In a world where the 300 wealthiest individuals control \nassets equivalent to those of the poorest three billion \u2013 or where top investment advisors can pick \nup bonuses of \u00a33 million each \u2013 the distribution of resources is clearly about something more \nthan either natural skills or propensity for hard work. And even at the more mundane and \nfamiliar level of inequality, the advantages that accrue to individuals almost always depend on a \nnetwork of relationships that have allowed some to benefit from the disadvantages of others. The \nwealth of the household with two or more high earners is made possible not just by the \ncombination of their individual talents and choices; it also depends on the low wages they are \nable to pay to their cleaners and nannies and gardeners. The wealth of a high-earning man is \nmade possible not just by his combination of talents and ambitions; it may also depend on the \navailability of a non-earning wife who frees him from housework and childcare. The good luck \nof one individual often depends on the bad luck of another: inequality is relational and not just \ncomparative.  \nMost egalitarians will agree that inequality is structural, but in taking up the challenge set \nby the anti-egalitarian right they have become overly preoccupied with what Anderson describes \nas \u2018the distribution of privately appropriated goods, such as income or resources, or privately \nenjoyed goods, such as welfare\u2019 (1999, p288). Where, in this, are the social structures of \noppression that are the more usual target of egalitarian political movements? Mostly in another \npart of the literature. As explorations of economic equality become more locked into a \nframework of individual comparison, the group component of inequality has migrated to a \ndifferent set of debates. In contemporary normative theory, the patterns of oppression that \nsubordinate one group to another are most commonly discussed within the framework of a \n 12 \n\u2018politics of difference\u2019 or a \u2018politics of recognition\u2019; and the paradigmatic examples are not \ninequalities of class but inequalities between  women and  men, ethnic minorities and ethnic \nmajorities. \nThe key concept in this second literature is citizenship, the key question being whether \nequality of citizenship has to be premised on all groups becoming the same. In an earlier \nframework that took class as the paradigmatic case of group inequality, difference was conceived \nas a barrier to citizen equality: something that either had to be eliminated (as when socialists \nargued that citizens would not be treated as equals so long as they were so different in their \nincome and power), or else disregarded (as when liberals argued that people should be treated as \nequals, despite any differences in income or wealth). In the debates that have subsequently \ndominated thinking on citizenship, the central concern has been how to detach equality from its \nperverse association with assimilation. How, for example, to ensure that liberal polities support \nrather than undermining the distinctive social identities that are often central to their citizens\u2019 \nsense of worth? How to ensure that women\u2019s entry into citizenship is not made conditional on \ntheir simulating \u2018masculine\u2019 activities and values? How to ensure that the citizenship of ethnic \nminority groups is not made conditional on them passing Norman Tebbit\u2019s \u2018cricket test\u2019? How to \nensure that the rights of indigenous peoples are not swept aside in phoney promises about \nincorporation into institutional arrangements favoured by victorious settlers? Those contributing \nto this work come from a variety of normative traditions (and are far more internally diverse than \nthose working on economic equality) but representative writings include Young (1990), Taylor \n(1992), Kymlicka (1995), Tully (1995), Lister (1997) and recent collections edited by Benhabib \n(1996), and Lukes and Joppke (1999). The Canadian influence is strong, reflecting a complex of \npolitical issues around multiculturalism, the status of Quebec, and the self-government demands \n 13 \nof indigenous peoples. The impact of feminism is also notable, reflecting what is by now a long \nhistory of discussion on the relationship between equality and difference. \nThe contrast between these two bodies of literature maps onto to what is widely described \nas a distinction between redistribution and recognition, though the deeper division, in my view, \nis between those who see inequality as a relationship between individuals and those who see it as \na relationship between groups. Nancy Fraser (1997) has written of a tension between a \nredistributive politics that centres on socioeconomic injustices like exploitation, poverty or \nunemployment, and a recognition politics that addresses the status injuries done to people when \nthey are subjected to stereotypical representations of their own culture or forced to subordinate \nthemselves to the self-understandings of a dominant group. Charles Taylor and Axel Honneth \n(1995) come readily to mind as major figures in the development of a politics of recognition, \nboth of them arguing that the non-recognition of one\u2019s distinctive identity is a form of oppression \nthat can profoundly injure one\u2019s sense of oneself. Nobody particularly springs to mind, however, \nas an exemplar of Fraser\u2019s politics of redistribution, for her definition already assumes a more \nstructural analysis of economic inequality - \u2018having the fruits of one\u2019s labour appropriated for the \nbenefit of others\u2019, \u2018being confined to undesirable or poorly paidwork\u2019 (Fraser, 1997, p13) \u2013 than \nis evident in current work on economic distribution. What is clear, however, is that the two \nstreams of thought now run largely in isolation from one another, so that analyses of economic \ninequality proceed untouched by any thoughts on diversity and difference while analyses of the \nconditions for equal citizenship barely engage with economic concerns. \nThis bifurcation in the literature is deeply unfortunate. Normative work on economic \nequality runs the risk of detachment from the pressing concerns of contemporary egalitarian \npolitics (which must surely include the problems of racial and sexual domination, and how to \n 14 \ndeal with the equality claims of minority ethnic and religious groups), while challenging new \nwork on what it means for different groups to participate as equals in civil society risks \nforgetting that there are economic conditions for this. One of the central themes to emerge out of \nthe literature on the politics of difference is that we have to fashion our understanding of equality \nto the plural nature of contemporary societies \u2013 seeking equality in heterogeneity, and maybe in \ndifferential rights for differently situated groups rather than making all groups the same. While \nthis rightly alerts us to the complexities of equality, it can also shift attention from the starker \ndisadvantages of income and wealth.  \n Sometimes, indeed, it seems that the critique of assimilation has generated a distrust of \nany kind of convergence, and that an entirely legitimate argument about equality being \ncompatible with difference leads into a disregard for differences that really should be removed. It \nwould clearly be absurd to suggest that divergent belief-systems should be brought together by \nhalving the difference or that cultural convergence is the only basis for cultural equality. But it is \nnot so absurd to suggest that equality between the sexes depends on ending the continuing \nsegregation between male and female occupations and roles, or that equality between rich and \npoor depends on reducing the gap.  Some differences are indeed incompatible with equality, and \nmany of the economic differences fall precisely into this camp. (For a fuller development of this \nargument, see Phillips, 1999.) One of the problems signalled by the work of Fraser and others is \nthat too exclusive an emphasis on recognition claims can mitigate the continuing urgency of \nredistribution. One of my hopes for the future is that normative theory will restore the balance \nbetween these two claims. \n \n \n 15 \n2. Pluralism and the Universality of Norms \nThe importance attached to cultural pluralism also feeds into debates about universalism and \ncultural particularism. The status of liberalism is central here. Liberalism attaches a high priority \nto the freedom of the individual, is inclined to rate the claims of the individual above the claims \nof any community, and tends be tolerant of difference, so long as the differences are conceived \nas matters of private concern. These principles are not, however, universally shared. If we take \nthe major world religions (not to mention the major secular divides) there is clearly considerable \ndisagreement on the importance of individual liberty, on what counts as a matter of private \nconscience, or when the claims of the individual can be subordinated to wider community \nconcerns. How, then, can liberals legitimately insist on \u2018their\u2019 principles as the right ones? \nLiberals often pride themselves on their tolerance and even-handedness, but there is a danger that \nthe very impartiality associated with liberalism conceals a favouritism towards the liberal point \nof view. \n Through much of the 1980s, debate on this proceeded through an opposition between \nliberal and communitarian theory, the first associated with norms that were universal but \nrelatively anodyne, the second with norms that were more substantive but linked to particular \nsocial contexts. In the paradigmatic liberal position (usually identified, though arguably \nmis-identified, with the early work of John Rawls), norms of justice were derived from a thought \nexperiment that assumed individuals to be rational creatures intent on their own self-interest. \nSelf-interest in isolation might encourage us to support policies that simply favoured our own \nkind: thus the rich would be against high taxes, while the poor would want better social \nprovision. But if we could additionally set aside what we know about our current position in \nsociety \u2013 including what we know about our desires and values and goals \u2013 we could be brought \n 16 \nto recognise the rationality of principles of justice that would be sufficiently favourable to each. \nIf we did not know, for example, whether we were going to inherit wealth and talent, whether we \nwere going to prefer opera to rock music, whether we were going to be atheists or Muslims or \nJews, we would converge on principles of tolerance and moderate redistribution that could \nsatisfy us whatever we turned out to be. \n The resulting principles would tend towards neutrality on most substantive moral issues \u2013 \nand to that extent be rather empty of content \u2013 but they would have the great advantage of being \nuniversal in scope. In the paradigmatic communitarian alternative, it makes no sense to think of \nindividuals outside their social and cultural contexts, for it is precisely those social practices and \ncultural traditions that are the source of normative value. Because of this, however, it also makes \nlittle sense to think of values as universally applicable wherever people happen to be. Instead of \npursuing principles and procedures that will be sufficiently abstract to apply to any community in \nand historical context, communitarian theorists then see values as formed through the shared \nunderstandings of particular societies and communities. This position is usually identified with \nthe work of Charles Taylor, Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Sandel and Michael Walzer, though \nagain there is a question of mis-identification, since none of these has adopted the label of \ncommunitarian theorist. Mulhall and Swift (1992) provide one of the best overviews of these \ndebates.  \n Positions on these issues have been further complicated by the impact of \npost-structuralism and post-modernism, which offers a parallel critique of moral universalism but \nusually wants nothing to do with invocations of \u2018the community\u2019; and the influence of feminism, \nwhich has developed its own objections to liberal contractarianism (eg. Pateman, 1988; Young, \n1990), but sees much communitarian theory as deeply conservative (see the argument in Frazer \n 17 \nand Lacey, 1993). Feminists have sometimes found themselves in uneasy alliance with \ncommunitarians because of a shared dissatisfaction with the individualism that characterises \nliberal thinking, and a shared distrust (though for different reasons) of universalism, which many \nfeminists have come to view as a trick of the patriarchal trade. Alternatively, some feminists \nhave aligned themselves with post-modernism, which offers a sceptical perspective on the \nmeta-narratives of modernity and the pretensions of universal thought (see essays in Nicholson \n(ed) 1990).  \n Richard Rorty's attack on foundationalist thinking (1989) has had an astonishing degree \nof success \u2013 so much so that debates staged on such topics as whether democracy needs \nfoundations tend to fizzle out when no-one is prepared to defend a strongly foundationalist \nposition. Rorty\u2019s cheerful ethno-centrism still raises hackles, but his central point about the \nemptiness of claiming that our values are grounded in either nature or reason has resonated more \nwidely, and even those most committed to the universalism of their ethical principles have \nregistered difficulties in establishing their case. The most common retort is that political \nradicalism will be diminished if people cannot appeal to some independent foundation as their \nbasis for criticising practices they find abhorrent, if they cannot establish some vantage point \noutside. This is, in my view, an incoherent objection, for even if removing what were once \nconceived as sure foundations for moral or political belief did condemn one to political \nimpotence, it is hard to see what would follow. We can hardly stake the universality of our \nprinciples on the fear of what would happen if we abandoned this claim. The case against \nfoundationalism cannot be countered by arguments of an instrumental nature, for if ever the \n'preference' for firm foundations is revealed as such (we 'need' universal principles, we 'need' a \nsecure vantage point from outside), the case collapses on itself. We cannot appeal to the \n 18 \nconsequences as the basis for returning to foundationalist thinking; the only basis for this return \nwould be the knowledge of sure foundations. \n Debates that began in an opposition between atomistic and socially embedded views of \nthe individual have become increasingly linked to issues of cultural pluralism and the limits of \nliberalism in dealing with illiberal cultures or groups. This is one of the themes taken up in the \ncollection edited by John Horton and Susan Mendus on Toleration, Identity and Difference \n(1999), which explores the implications of identity politics for the core liberal principle of \ntoleration. Liberalism has come under fire for failing to address the recognition claims of diverse \ncultural groups \u2013 for pretending to a neutrality that is in truth loaded against minority groups. \nThere has also been a reaction against this in some recent feminist literature, which restates \nliberalism as central to the concerns of sexual equality (Moller Okin, 1998; Nussbaum, 1999).  \nBut as Richard Bellamy usefully notes, setting up the issue as a tension between liberalism and \nmulticulturalism is not always helpful, for \u2018the multicultural perspective unwittingly reinforces a \nwidespread liberal prejudice that pluralist objections to liberalism derive solely from illiberal \nthrowbacks miraculously marooned in the modern world.\u2019(1999,p3) Yet those challenges to the \nliberal hegemony that have come from cultural and ethnic minorities querying the uniform \nimposition of one set of values on a diversity of identities and groups are best understood as \nclaims made in the name of equality. To that extent, they are claims made in the name of what \nare supposed to be good liberal principles \u2013 rather than claims that emanate from somewhere \noutside. \nThere have been a number of responses to the combined onslaught from communitarianism \nand post-modern anti-foundationalism, and among the most currently influential are those that \nstress the interaction of actual (no longer abstract) individuals in the formulation of principles \n 19 \nand norms. This approach detaches the defence of universalism from any lingering taint of \nfoundationalism, and while continuing to regard norms as universal rather than contextual,  \ntreats these norms as justified by reference to the conditions under which they are produced. One \nvariant of this, much influenced by Scanlon\u2019s essay on \u2018Contractualism and Utilitarianism\u2019 \n(1982), considers what principles reasonable and reasonably well-informed persons might come \nto agree on if they were operating in conditions of equal power. Rather than thinking of \nindividuals as abstracted from their social contexts, this takes it for granted that people know a \ngreat deal about themselves and others in their society. Indeed in Brian Barry\u2019s version (1994), it \nis precisely this knowledge that makes them aware of the fallibility of any \u2019truth\u2019 claims. The \npresumption of equality (all citizens being regarded as equals) then combines with scepticism \n(no-one being able to establish with certainty that his or her beliefs are the right ones) to generate \nimpartiality as the central - and in Barry\u2019s argument, most definitely universal - rule of justice. \nReasonable people will recognise that if they object to policies that favour another group or \nanother set of beliefs over their own, then others may reasonably make the same objection. To \nput this the other way round, it is only if people unreasonably believe they have a monopoly on \ntruth or that their interests matter more than those of others that they would claim the right to \nimpose their own interests or views.  \n What is notable about this is that it moves from the abstracted individual of Rawls\u2019 \noriginal position to a society of actual people. Normative principles then arise out of our \nrelationships to one another. The stronger version of this \u2013 associated with notions of \ndeliberative or communicative democracy - addresses more seriously the processes through \nwhich people engage with one another\u2019s point of view. Appeals to reasonableness alone are risky \nand potentially flawed, for there is always a question about what might have been smuggled into \n 20 \nthe notion of reasonableness, and always an issue about who decides what counts as a reasonable \nobjection. Barry\u2019s version of reasonable agreement does presume real people, but it still proceeds \nthrough private processes of  reasoned argument (we each of us argue with ourselves), and this \nleaves the more suspicious reader wondering whether Barry\u2019s notion of what is reasonable will \ncoincide with anyone\u2019s else\u2019s. In contrast to this, those working within a framework of \ndeliberative democracy (representative examples range across Manin, 1987; Cohen, 1989; \nMiller, 1993; Gutmann and Thompson, 1996, Habermas, 1996) focus attention on the dialogue \nbetween individuals and groups, arguing that the legitimacy of norms depends on the unforced \nagreement of all the relevant groups. \nIn deliberative versions of democracy, just decisions can only be arrived at through \nprocedures that are fair and transparent and allow for maximum engagement with competing \nperspectives. The intuition underpinning this is that the partiality of each perspective will emerge \nthrough its exposure to others, and that the public engagement with different experiences and \narguments \u2013 which deepen understanding of the available political choices and alert participants \nto the legitimacy of different claims \u2013 will then enable people to arrive at their principles of \njustice. Some theorists (most notably Habermas) retain a strongly 'Enlightenment' notion of the \nuniversal principles that can be arrived at under ideal conditions, while others are more cautious \nabout the permanent contestation that is implied in radical difference. In all versions, equality \nand publicity figure as the central conditions, for the deliberation that peremptorily excludes \nparticular values or arguments or perspectives cannot be expected to produce the desired results.  \n Taken as a theory about how democracies should organise themselves, deliberative \ndemocracy often looks hopelessly utopian \u2013 too far a cry from the professionalisation of \ncontemporary politics and the passivity of the modern citizenry. But taken as a theory about the \n 21 \nbasis for normative judgements, it has the undoubted merit of building pluralism and difference \ninto the very constitution of our values and norms. So where a rights-based understanding of \ndemocracy might draw up an a priori list of fundamental rights, deliberative democracy is more \nlikely to stress the importance of intercultural dialogue in the formulation of central principles. \nAnd where invocations of reasonableness might \u2018implicitly prejudice the agenda in favour of an \ninherited background of settled traditions\u2019 (Habermas,1996, p309), a deliberative understanding \nof democracy makes us more sensitive to the claims of those perceived as \u2019wild\u2019 or \u2018anarchic\u2019 or \nin some way beyond the pale. It is for this reason, mainly, that there has been such feminist \ninterest in deliberative democracy. \nIn the shift from rationality to reasonableness to substantive processes of dialogue and \ndebate, normative theorists might be said to be challenging starker oppositions between \nnormative and empirical considerations, and taking more seriously the political and institutional \nframework out of which moral norms emerge. In most versions, however, this is still just a \npromissory note. On the crucial point of equality, in particular, much of the work on deliberative \ndemocracy remains gestural. Theorists typically insist that the validity of normative judgements \ndepends on the free and equal access of all those likely to be affected by decisions, but do not \nusually bother too much about how to make sure that this occurs. Yet failing more sustained \nefforts to ensure that all voices are equally and fairly heard, deliberative models of democracy \nbecome little more than a pious attachment to informed over ill-informed decisions, or a belief in \nthe power of discussion as making possible solutions that were impossible. As such, they risk \ndeclining into little more than glorified common-sense. \n It is at this point that we can most usefully identify some differences between the British \nand American traditions. The first hint of difference is that the lingering resonance of Marxism in \n 22 \nBritish political debate means that British theorists are more pre-occupied than their North \nAmerican counterparts with economic and material equality. They have been less willing to \nendorse the shift of emphasis from problems of economic distribution to problems of cultural \nrecognition (see Graham, 1999; Baker, 1999; Phillips, 1999); and even if debates in Britain \nsometimes seem too close a replay of Canadian pre-occupations with Quebec and the rights of \naboriginal peoples or US pre-occupations with multiculturalism in the university curriculum, \nthere has also been resistance to this. \n British theorists also seem marginally more at ease with the interplay between normative \nand empirical work, and tend to regard empirical plausibility as of equal significance alongside \ntheoretical rigour. This is a self-conscious strategy both in David Beetham\u2019s work on democracy \nand in Richard Bellamy\u2019s recent book on Liberalism and Pluralism (1999).  Bellamy develops \na case for \u2018negotiated compromise\u2019 as his alternative to the liberal trimmers (who go for \nuniversalism but at the cost of restricting themselves to the least controversial issues) or the \ncommunitarian segregators (who get more substance into their normative principles but at the \ncost of restricting themselves to particular societies or cultures). In Bellamy\u2019s approach , the key \npoint about value pluralism is that it exists between particular people in particular circumstances. \nIt is when those people embark on processes of negotiation and compromise (when they get \nstuck into \u2018real\u2019 politics), that the nature of their conflicts is clarified and  - sometimes - \nresolved. This puts more flesh onto what have seemed rather high-flown images of deliberation, \nand Bellamy pursues his argument through such examples as the incorporation of the European \nConvention on Human Rights into British law, and the competing conceptions of European \ncitizenship that could underpin the development of the European Union.  \n 23 \n It would be misleading, however, to conclude that British normative theory is therefore \ncharacterised by a greater sensitivity to \u2018real-life\u2019 politics or displays a greater commitment to \neconomic equality. In normative theory, it has been more common to contrast an \nAnglo-American with a Continental European tradition, the first hugely influenced by the work \nof Rawls, the second by the critical theory tradition currently represented by Habermas or the \nvery different post-structuralism associated with Michel Foucault. (This distinction is not to be \nconfused with location, for some of the leading exponents of critical theory currently work in \nNorth America, while the ideas of French or German theorists are often refracted back to Britain \nvia the USA.) It is not easy \u2013 and is perhaps in the end pointless \u2013 to mark out a \u2018European\u2019 or \n\u2018British\u2019 tradition as distinct from developments in the USA; and the difficulties surrounding \nsuch attempts are increased by the growing interchange between these traditions. Many have \ncommented on the greater accessibility of Habermas\u2019 Between Facts and Norms. This is partly \nbecause it is more grounded in political and legal theory than his earlier more sociological work; \nbut it also reflects Habermas\u2019s increasing engagement with Anglo-American theory as \nrepresented by Rawls, Dworkin, Bruce Ackerman or Cass Sunstein.  \n The unifying point, across America and Europe alike, has been the collapse of socialism \nas a viable political project, and the impact this has had on the evolution of normative thought. \nMany of the older oppositions that characterised debate have been reformulated, previously \nunder-theorised issues have come to the fore, and new energy has been unleashed on assessments \nof the liberal tradition. Normative theory is very much alive and kicking \u2013 but I do wish it would \nkick a bit harder against persistent and growing inequality. \n 24 \nReferences \nAnderson, E.A.
