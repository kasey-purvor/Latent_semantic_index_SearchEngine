These factors\ninclude stress and psychological states; sleep, fatigue, and alertness; and health status.\nPhysical activity appears to influence all these human factors but has not previously\nbeen systematically considered as a direct or indirect risk factor for driver accidents.\nThis chapter provides an overview, within an evidence-based framework, of the impact\neach of these human factors has on driver performance and risk of at-work road traffic\naccidents and then examines how physical (in)activity may moderate and mediate these\nrelationships. Finally, we consider practical implications for work site interventions.\nThe review aims to offer an evidence base for the deployment of resources to promote\nphysical activity, manage stress, facilitate sleep, reduce fatigue, and enhance alertness\nto improve physical and psychological health among professional drivers.\nINTRODUCTION\nProfessional drivers make a significant contribution to road traffic accident statis-\ntics (8, 50) at an extraordinary human and financial cost (49a). A number of studies\nhave shown that workers who drive as part of their occupation have a higher acci-\ndent risk than does the general driving population, even when a greater exposure to\nrisk is factored out (8, 18, 77). An understanding of the antecedents of accidents, for\ndifferent kinds of organizations with different kinds of professional drivers, is es-\nsential to designing effective interventions to reduce fatalities and serious injuries.\nIndeed, both the United Kingdom and the United States have set national targets to\nreduce accident involvement [40% reduction in the United Kingdom by 2010 (16);\n0163-7525\/06\/0421-0001$20.00 2.1\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\n2.2 TAYLOR \u0001 DORN\n41% reduction in large truck fatalities from 1996 to 2008 in the United States (34)].\nEfforts to do so have focused largely on in-situ driver-assisted technologies, drug\nand alcohol testing, regulation of working conditions (e.g., length of shift), and\nadvice on prescribed and over-the-counter medication. A number of other factors,\nincluding stress and emotions, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and health status, have\nbeen independently linked to increased risk of at-work accidents. Although driver\nstress and fatigue appear to be major contributors to at-work road traffic accidents\n(11, 78), it is less clear which factors contribute to driver stress and fatigue.\nPhysical activity has been reported to effectively influence stress and psycho-\nlogical states, fatigue, sleep, and health status (17, 113), but less scholarly focus has\nbeen given to the effects on work-place safety (102). In the driving context, only\none study (105) has reported a direct connection. Drivers engaging in more than\none weekly session of exercise had 0.78 accidents per driver, whereas less-active\ndrivers had 1.05 accidents over a two-year period. This was not, however, a main\nelement of the Dutch study of long-distance bus drivers, and there were inherent\nlimitations with the methods used (e.g., measure of physical activity). In contrast,\nother studies have attempted to consider if heavy exercise causes commercial driver\naccidents (86) as a result of fatigue. Clearly there is a need both to understand the\neffects of exercise directly and indirectly on accident antecedents (e.g., stress,\nfatigue, and health status) and also to develop and examine the effectiveness of\nphysical activity interventions on risk of driver accidents.\nDefinitions\nIt is first important to define the terms physical fitness, physical activity, and\nexercise within the context of chronic and acute exercise (12).\n1. Physical fitness is a set of attributes that people have or achieve that relates\nto their ability to perform physical activity.\n2. Physical activity is any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that\nresults in energy expenditure.\n3. Exercise is planned, structured, and repetitive bodily movement purposefully\ndone to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness or\nhealth.\nBoth the chronic and acute effects of physical activity (or exercise) have been ex-\namined. Chronic exercise involves regular participation over time (e.g., 10 weeks,\nat least 3 days a week for 20 min at vigorous intensity at a level that would make\ntalking difficult, or at least 5 days a week for an accumulated 30 min at moderate\nintensity, such as a single session or three brisk 10-min walks at a level that would\nstill permit talking). Acute exercise involves a single period of exercise.\nIn the present context, chronic exercise may enhance fitness and coping re-\nsources and result in improvements in or reduce the risk of ill health. There is\nreason to suppose that acute exercise may have short-term effects that have an\nimpact on driver behavior and cognitive performance (e.g., increased alertness).\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ROAD ACCIDENTS 2.3\nPurpose\nThis review provides a framework (see Figure 1) founded on relevant literature pub-\nlished in diverse areas of scientific inquiry, which will help guide future research,\nsynthesis, and interventions. Complex links clearly exist between stress, fatigue,\nsleep, health status, and driver accident risk, but the purpose of the review is to\nFigure 1 A framework for linking chronic and acute exercise to driver stress, fatigue,\nhealth status, and performance.\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\n2.4 TAYLOR \u0001 DORN\nconsider critically the possible impact of physical (in)activity on these relation-\nships as both a moderating (individual difference in response to chronic exercise)\nand mediating [a temporary period of (in)activity] variable. Finally, we consider\nthe effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity among professional\ndrivers.\nSTRESS, PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES, AND DRIVER\nPERFORMANCE: EFFECTS OF (IN)ACTIVITY\nDriving requires sustained attention in complex dynamic tasks and detection\nof changes in the task environment to search for potential hazards. Perception\nof hazards may be affected by driver stress, especially for professional drivers\nwho often have to adhere to strict schedules and timetables (21). Driver stress\nresults from a continual interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, e.g., life\nevents and daily hassles (100) of driving moderated by a number of individual\ndifferences.\nDriver stress vulnerability relates to cognitive processes of appraisal and cop-\ning specified by transactional models of stress (76, 79). Demands may exceed\nperceived capability or resources: Stress factors (and outcomes including fatigue)\nwere associated with performance impairments primarily in underload conditions\n(78). The main intrinsic sources of professional driver stress vary according to\nthe type of vehicle being driven and the nature of the work. Among company\ncar drivers (18), heavy goods vehicle drivers (114, 117), and long-distance pub-\nlic service vehicle drivers (69, 83, 98), time pressures (particularly on congested\nroads) are a common factor, combined with long hours spent driving. In an in-\ndustry with a shortage of skilled drivers, poor health status and a consequential\nhigh absenteeism (121), and low profit margins, inevitably some employers may\nplace excessive demands on drivers. For example, in the operation of buses in\nurban areas workload has high demands with little control over ability to make\ndecisions to help cope with the demands of the job (22, 42). Driving buses can also\nbe socially isolating and involve dealing with difficult passengers. It also requires\nheightened alertness to deal with inconsiderate road users who may miscalculate\nthe operational capabilities of large vehicles and behave aggressively in response to\na slow-moving bus making frequent stops. Occupational stress can also spill over\ninto home life because of split schedules and rotating shifts. For other professional\ndriver groups, there may be different issues: For example, with emergency service\ndrivers, additional stress can arise from high-speed driving in pursuit of offend-\ners or to reach an accident scene (21). Although we may view the framework in\nFigure 1 as causal, undoubtedly there are reciprocal and interacting relationships.\nFor example, an accident history, inadequate sleep and fatigue, poor health status,\nand negative psychological states may all independently and in combination have\nan impact on how occupational events are interpreted (i.e., perceived demands)\nand on their associated perceived resources for coping.\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ROAD ACCIDENTS 2.5\nSo how does driver stress affect the health and safety of the professional driver?\nGreater traffic congestion and time pressures predicted aggression, irritability, frus-\ntration, and negative mood (53). The acute and chronic nature of daily work strain\nand driving events leads to heightened psycho-physiological responses (106, 114).\nDrivers often experience symptoms of driver stress such as worry, irritation, and\nanxiety. The cognitive interference model for adverse effects of stress has been for-\nmulated from extensive research on test anxiety. The diversion of resources away\nfrom the task resulting from interference becomes increasingly detrimental to per-\nformance as task demands increase. Attentional overload can occur when resources\nbecome inadequate for the total processing load imposed on the cognitive system.\nFor example, a high-anxiety condition during a simulated drive resulted in slower\nand less accurate identification of peripheral lights and significant performance\ndecrements in central and peripheral tasks when compared with a low-anxiety\ncondition (60). However, this model neglects a person\u2019s active attempts to cope\nwith stress-related demands through compensation and task-focused strategies.\nTherefore stress-related impairment may be a function of failure to match effort\nwith workload rather than with resource insufficiency. The driver stress inventory\n(DSI) (80) has been used to show that more severe stress reactions may disrupt\ndriver performance and reduce safety (23).\nWith repeated exposure to stressful driving contexts over the course of a journey,\nfatigue symptoms may develop (73). Although driver fatigue has been conceptu-\nalized as a consequence of circadian disruption and sleep deprivation (56) leading\nto reduced alertness and impaired performance (4), driver stress has hiterto not\nbeen linked with circadian disruption or sleep deprivation.\nDriving for a sustained period can increase fatigue and alter cardiovascular\nand neuroendocrine function (104). Ambulatory studies of professional drivers\nhave demonstrated cortical deactivation in response to continuous driving over\nmonotonous and repetitive environments (7). Therefore, arousal is important for\nmaintaining the vigilance and phasic alertness to stimuli required for safe driving.\nQuantity and quality of sleep can inevitably be affected by overstimulation of\nthe neuro-endocrine system, as a compensatory coping mechanism for dealing\nwith driver-related fatigue, and compounded by overuse of legal stimulants (e.g.,\ncaffeine products). Psycho-physiological recovery from driving shifts has recently\nbeen monitored (106) to investigate in situ responses to fatigue debt, but we know\nlittle about how drivers use different coping strategies and whether exercise can be\nused to influence chronobiological responses among drivers. However, a measure\nof need for recovery as an indicator of the level of work-related fatigue among coach\ndrivers has been used to demonstrate that this variable can predict psychosomatic\ncomplaints, sleep disorders, and occupational burnout (104).\nStress and Health Status\nStress-related disorders have been widely recognized: the Department of Health\nin the United Kingdom estimated that 80 million working days are lost annually\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\n2.6 TAYLOR \u0001 DORN\nowing to anxiety and depression at a cost of \u00a35.3 billion (\u223c$9.31 billion) (15).\nIn addition, health care expenditure for the treatment of anxiety and depression\nhas been estimated at more than \u00a31 billion (\u223c$1.76 billion). Stress has been\nlinked with cancer, coronary heart disease\/stroke, accidents, and poor mental health\n(16, 108). The mechanisms have been considered both indirect, through effects of\nstress on health behaviors such as diet (120) and smoking (61), and direct, through\nbiological changes including neuroendocrine changes and adaptations (1), devel-\nopment of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, disturbances of blood\ncoagulation, and disruption of immune responses (2, 10). Recent research has also\nfocused on psycho-physiological measures of recovery from work as an indicator\nof effective coping (104), which mediates the link between a demanding work\nenvironment and health status. Stress-induced fatigue may also increase the use of\ncaffeine, which in turn may disrupt coping and adversely affect sleep and health\nstatus.\nThe role of personality in moderating the effects of stress on driver accidents\nhas received some attention (23), but little consideration has been given to the role\nof an individual\u2019s level of physical fitness and physical activity as an individual\ndifference factor.\nChronic and Acute Exercise, Stress, and Psychological States\nChronic and acute exercise may help to reduce stress and its psychological and\nphysical responses in a number of ways (84). First, from a cognitive perspective,\nbeing more physically active may increase resilience, hardiness, physical self-\nperceptions and self-concept (see 111), and perceived energy, and reduce fatigue;\nthese attributes influence how we initially cognitively appraise events that are\nintrinsic and extrinsic to the occupation. Physical fitness, as a coping resource,\nmay also enable a more positive secondary appraisal of stressors (65). Engage-\nment in acute exercise can also provide a distraction away from rumination about\nstressors, particularly if it involves social interaction with others. Second, from\na psycho-physiological perspective, improved aerobic capacity or ability to deal\nwith a physical stressor may attenuate our physical response to a psychological\nstressor (stress reactivity). Attenuated physiological responses (e.g., heart rate,\nblood pressure, etc.) to, and more rapid recovery from, stressors may leave peo-\nple feeling less fatigued and more able to cope with events that are intrinsic and\nextrinsic to the occupation (48).\nThe past 30 years has resulted in a large volume of literature on physical activity\nand stress and anxiety, including 29 reviews (74) and 57 (40) reviews, respectively.\nRecently, an overview (109) was published of systematic qualitative (without meta-\nanalyses) reviews (articles and book chapters) and six quantitative (with meta-\nanalyses) reviews. In summary, the findings point to the following conclusions:\n1. Chronic exercise can result in lower subjective (e.g., anxiety) and objective\n(e.g., blood pressure) indicators of stress responses. When stressors are\npresented, the evidence for absolute reductions in cardiovascular response\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ROAD ACCIDENTS 2.7\nto stress is more consistent than it is for reduced reactivity (or change) to\nstressors.\n2. Single sessions of moderate intensity exercise, particularly aerobic and\nrhythmic in nature, can result in lower subjective (e.g., anxiety) and objec-\ntive (e.g., blood pressure) indicators of stress responses. This evidence has\nfocused almost exclusively on changing anxiety and arousal under normal\nrather than enhanced stressful conditions, when the effects may be even\ngreater.\n3. A single session of moderate intensity exercise may reduce physiologi-\ncal reactivity to a variety of mostly laboratory stressors (48) and enhance\nrecovery after the stressor. Further research is needed for driving-related\nstressors.\nBoth chronic and acute exercise can improve subjective tension, depression,\nand anger\/hostility (3). Very vigorous exercise may reduce coping assets (e.g.,\nlower feelings of control, self-confidence, elation, etc.) and increase coping deficits\n(e.g., easily irritated, feeling run down and drained, feeling less calm, etc.) (87). In\ncontrast, moderate intensity exercise (e.g., at a level that enables continued talking)\nmay enhance coping assets, reduce coping deficits, and provide a sense of physical\nwell-being.\nSLEEP, FATIGUE, ALERTNESS, AND DRIVER\nPERFORMANCE: EFFECTS OF (IN)ACTIVITY\nDriver fatigue has been identified as a major cause of serious accidents (14, 56, 81)\nowing to reduced driving performance efficiency. Over a quarter of long distance\nlorry drivers reported falling asleep at the wheel at some time during the previous\n12 months of driving (81). However, fatigue-related accidents are complex, and\nnumerous factors have been proposed for the causes of fatigue and low alertness\nimplicated in increased driver risk. These causes include (a) stress and task de-\nmands, (b) hours on task, (c) sleep deprivation and disorders, (d ) time of day and\ncircadian variation, and (e) effort investment and motivation.\nEarlier we considered the role of stress as a cause of fatigue, but clearly other\ncauses exist and there is a need for further conceptual clarity. Driver stress and\nfatigue are dependent on both driving-related and nondriving-related factors, often\nin different ways. Many investigators prefer to discuss the multifactorial concomi-\ntants of both driver stress and fatigue. For fatigue, there is a circadian variation in\nadrenaline excretion, noradrenaline, performance, and fatigue ratings (36). Peak\nof circadian variation for each of these variables was at a different time of day (37),\nand adrenaline excretion was not significantly correlated with performance (36).\nIn terms of stress physiology and fatigue, this suggests that driver stress and fatigue\nare conceptually distinct but related processes that both interact with chronobio-\nlogical changes.\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\n2.8 TAYLOR \u0001 DORN\nProfessional driver fatigue may result from the occupational requirement of\ndriving for long hours, with progressive withdrawal of attention from the road and\ntraffic demands particularly in familiar environments (9) involving cognitive un-\nderload rather than excessive information-processing demands. Some researchers\nbelieve that prolonged driving in monotonous conditions should be characterized\nas a demanding task that is associated with effort costs, even though working mem-\nory load and controlled information processing demands are low (115). However,\nthe contribution of time on task in the development of fatigue may be small in\ncomparison to time of day, poor sleep, and individual differences (e.g., the point at\nwhich aversion to invest effort and stop driving because of subjective fatigue symp-\ntoms begins to develop) (90). Also, prolonged driving will not necessarily cause\nserious problems if drivers can choose the speed and safety margins they prefer\nand if they can stop driving if they so desire (9, 115). Yet with strict occupational\nscheduling demands disrupting the adoption of safety margins in prolonged driv-\ning, detriments to central task components such as steering have been observed,\nalthough performance in high-priority subtasks such as hazard avoidance remained\nintact. Fatigued drivers can also maintain adequate performance and protect task\npriorities (54) through compensatory strategies such as driving slower (if organi-\nzational demands permit). The combination of being in a hurry (driver stress) and\nprolonged driving may be particularly dangerous.\nChronic and Acute Exercise, Sleep, Fatigue, Alertness,\nand Accident Risk\nThe potential role of exercise in reducing work-related fatigue (and accident risk)\nis complex, and any brief discussion is in danger of oversimplifying the interre-\nlationships. In the previous section on stress, a link between stress and psycho-\nphysiological response and sleep was suggested. Long-distance coach drivers who\ndid more than one session of exercise per week (to increase physical condition)\nreported lower scores on their need-for-recovery scale (107), but the study did not\nconsider if chronic or acute exercise facilitated psycho-physiological indicators\nof recovery or ability to sleep. In contrast, others (93) have attempted to deter-\nmine if physical exertion (e.g., cargo loading) causes fatigue and reduced driver\nalertness.\nTwo research questions of significance to driver safety research are\n1. does chronic and acute exercise result in improved quality and quantity of\nsleep? and\n2. does chronic and acute exercise result in enhanced psychological states\nsuch as vigor, alertness and activation, reduced fatigue, drowsiness, and\ndeactivation?\nThe five recent reviews highlighted in Table 1 largely draw the same conclusions\nthat chronic and acute exercise can influence quality and quantity of sleep. Also,\nsubjectively, people report that exercise is an important behavior for sleep hygiene.\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ROAD ACCIDENTS 2.9\nTA\nBL\nE\n1\nR\nev\nie\nw\npa\npe\nrs\no\nn\nef\nfe\nct\nso\nfc\nhr\non\nic\nan\nd\nac\nu\nte\nex\ner\nci\nse\no\nn\nsle\nep\n\u2217\nR\nef\ner\nen\nce\nTy\npe\no\nfp\nar\nad\nig\nm\nTy\npe\no\nfr\nev\nie\nw\nM\nai\nn\nre\nsu\nlts\n(71\n)\nA\ncu\nte\nan\nd\nch\nro\nni\nc\nM\net\na-\nan\nal\nys\nis:\nA\ncu\nte\n\u2014\n32\nst\nud\nie\ns(\n82\n8E\nSs\n);\nCh\nro\nni\nc\u2014\n12\nst\nud\nie\ns(\n27\n4E\nSs\n)\nA\ncu\nte\nex\n\u2192\npo\nsit\niv\ne\nef\nfe\nct\nso\nn\n7\nke\ny\nsle\nep\nm\nea\nsu\nre\ns\n(E\nS\n=\n0.\n14\n\u20130\n.7\n5).\nCh\nro\nni\nc\nex\ner\nci\nse\n\u2192\npo\nsit\niv\ne\nef\nfe\nct\nso\nn\n5\nke\ny\nsle\nep\nm\nea\nsu\nre\ns\n(E\nS\n=\n0.\n40\n\u20130\n.9\n4).\nEf\nfe\nct\nsg\nre\nat\ner\nfo\nrf\nem\nal\nes\n,l\nes\nsfi\nt,\no\nld\ner\n,\nan\nd\nw\nhe\nn\nex\ner\nci\nse\nis\nlo\nng\ner\n,\nae\nro\nbi\nc,\nn\no\ntl\nat\ne\nin\nev\nen\nin\ng.\n(24\n)\nA\ncu\nte\nN\nar\nra\ntiv\ne\nPo\nsit\niv\ne\nef\nfe\nct\no\nfe\nx\ner\nci\nse\nin\nA\n.\nM\n.\nan\nd\no\nfm\no\nde\nra\nte\nin\nte\nns\nity\nin\nP.\nM\n.\nSl\nee\np-\ndi\nsr\nup\ntiv\ne\nef\nfe\nct\no\nfe\nx\ner\nci\nse\nif\nhi\ngh\nin\nte\nns\nity\n,\nlo\nng\ndu\nra\ntio\nn,\no\nr\nu\nn\nac\ncu\nst\nom\ned\n.\n(92\n)\nCr\nos\ns-\nse\nct\nio\nna\nl;\nac\nu\nte\n;c\nhr\non\nic\n;b\ned\nre\nst\nM\nai\nnl\ny\nn\nar\nra\ntiv\ne\nan\nd\nal\nso\nm\net\na-\nan\nal\nys\nis\n(w\nith\nfe\nw\nde\nta\nils\n)\nCo\nns\nist\nen\ncy\nac\nro\nss\nep\nid\nem\nio\nlo\ngi\nca\nl,\nac\nu\nte\n,a\nn\nd\nch\nro\nni\nc\nst\nud\nie\nsf\nor\nlo\nw\n-m\no\nde\nra\nte\nef\nfe\nct\no\nfe\nx\ner\nci\nse\nbu\ntm\net\nho\ndo\nlo\ngi\nca\nll\nim\nita\ntio\nns\n(e.\ng.,\nlim\nite\nd\nm\nai\nnl\ny\nto\ngo\nod\nsle\nep\ner\ns).\n(12\n3)\nA\ncu\nte\nM\net\na-\nan\nal\nys\nis:\n38\nst\nud\nie\ns\n(21\n1e\nffe\nct\ns)\nM\nod\ner\nat\ne\nES\no\nn\n4\nsle\nep\nm\nea\nsu\nre\ns\n(0.\n18\n\u20130\n.52\n).E\nffe\nct\nsg\nre\nat\ner\nfo\nr\nlo\nng\ner\nex\ner\nci\nse\nan\nd\nn\no\ntl\nat\ne\nin\nth\ne\nda\ny.\nES\nlim\nite\nd\nby\nex\ncl\nus\niv\ne\nfo\ncu\nso\nn\ngo\nod\nsle\nep\ner\ns.\n(12\n2)\nCr\nos\ns-\nse\nct\nio\nna\nl,\nac\nu\nte\nan\nd\nch\nro\nni\nc\nSy\nste\nm\nat\nic\n,n\nar\nra\ntiv\ne\nPe\nop\nle\nbe\nlie\nv\ne\nth\nat\nex\ner\nci\nse\nis\nan\nim\npo\nrta\nnt\nsle\nep\n-p\nro\nm\not\nin\ng\nbe\nha\nv\nio\nr.\nIn\ndi\nv\nid\nua\nls\nw\nho\nex\ner\nci\nse\nre\ngu\nla\nrly\nha\nv\ne\na\nlo\nw\ner\nris\nk\no\nfd\nist\nur\nbe\nd\nsle\nep\n.\nCh\nro\nni\nc\nex\ner\nci\nse\nm\nay\nel\nic\nit\nim\npr\nov\nem\nen\nts\nin\nsle\nep\nin\nin\ndi\nv\nid\nua\nls\nw\nith\ndi\nstu\nrb\ned\nsle\nep\n.\nA\ncu\nte\nex\ner\nci\nse\n(pa\nrti\ncu\nlar\nly\no\nfl\non\nge\nrd\nur\nat\nio\nn)\nel\nic\nits\nm\no\nde\nst\nim\npr\nov\nem\nen\nti\nn\nsle\nep\nam\no\nn\ng\ngo\nod\nsle\nep\ner\ns.\nFi\ntn\nes\ns,\nex\ner\nci\nse\nin\nte\nns\nity\n,\no\nr\ntim\ne\no\nfd\nay\nha\nv\ne\nm\nin\nim\nal\nm\no\nde\nra\ntin\ng\nin\nflu\nen\nce\n.\n\u2217 E\nS\n=\nef\nfe\nct\nsiz\ne.\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\n2.10 TAYLOR \u0001 DORN\nThe most recent review (122) highlights the complexity of exercise and sleep\nresearch and the quest to identify moderating factors and mechanisms.\nStudies involving often unreliable, self-reported measures of physical activity\nand sleep are limited. However, in a recent relatively rigorous trial (67), investiga-\ntors reported that 16 weeks of community-based exercise consisting of 67 males\nand females between 50 and 76 years of age resulted in significant net improve-\nments per night in sleep duration (42 min) and sleep-onset latency (11.5 min).\nSeparating out the chronic and acute effects is challenging; these effects may have\nresulted from an increase in dose of daily exercise due to training. Also, the small\nsample sizes that typify the more rigorous studies do not allow full analysis for\nmoderating effects of variables such as dose of exercise (e.g., frequency, inten-\nsity, duration), timing of exercise, and initial sleep status. One of the key issues\nto address is not the acute effects of a single session of exercise in a day, which\nis what most of the literature has considered, but what the effect of total daily\nenergy expenditure on sleep is (122). This is more difficult to assess, but the use\nof accelerometers should advance the field. Those in sedentary occupations, such\nas driving, may be particularly prone to sleep disorders unless they compensate\nwith regular exercise when not driving. Also, further understanding of the mecha-\nnisms by which exercise influences sleep is needed to prescribe exercise for sleep\nenhancement (122).\nIf inadequate sleep and stress (intrinsic and extrinsic to work-related driving)\ncan result in fatigue, drowsiness, and deactivation, can chronic and acute exercise\ninfluence these psychological states? In a review of 20 studies (82) designed to\ninvestigate the effects of chronic aerobic exercise, significant increases in vigor\n[Effect Size (ES) = 0.40] and reductions in fatigue (ES = \u22120.27) were reported.\nAn extensive narrative review confirmed that less-active people report greater fa-\ntigue, and chronic exercise results in greater levels of perceived vigor and alertness\nand less fatigue (3).\nThere is a general perception that acute exercise will induce fatigue and physical\nexhaustion, which may be detrimental to driver performance, rather than increase\nactivation and alertness (see 93). As a result, individuals may seek to regulate\npsychological states (e.g., fatigue) by avoiding exercise in favor of stimulants such\nas sugar snacks and caffeine. An accumulation of inactivity would result in further\ndeconditioning and reduced energy. It is therefore critical to consider, within a\nconceptually clear framework, the actual relationship between acute exercise and\nthese psychological states (27, 28).\nLaboratory-based studies suggest that moderate- to high-intensity (vigorous)\nacute exercise can lead to increased levels of fatigue and exhaustion in the later\nparts of an exercise session, and it takes some time (depending on the length of\nexercise and an individual\u2019s fitness level) before these feelings return to normal. In\ncontrast, feelings of revitalization occur during and after low-moderate intensity\nexercise and last some time (depending on the length of exercise) (26).\nFairly rigorous field-based studies (e.g., involving pagers and other sampling\nmethods) have shown that low-moderate intensity exercise (e.g., walking) results\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ROAD ACCIDENTS 2.11\nin significantly higher levels of revitalization, with the effects lasting throughout\nthe day, hours after the exercise bout occurred (38, 39). Indeed, 10-min walks were\nassociated with increases in self-rated energy lasting for 2 h, whereas a sugar snack\ncondition was associated with significantly higher energy and reduced tiredness\nfor 1 h, followed 1 h later by increased tiredness and reduced energy (112). In\nanother study that involved walking (in both laboratory and natural settings) (25),\nthe circumplex model (99) was used to investigate the effects of exercise on valence\nand arousal. Across 4 experimental studies, the results consistently showed that\nshort (10\u201315-min) bouts of walking was associated with increased activation (and\na state of calmness and relaxation).\nA study to compare exercise and behavior typically used by drivers for mood\nregulation (i.e., sugar snacking) has been conducted (112). However, further re-\nsearch is needed to understand the effects of brief periods of moderate inten-\nsity exercise in comparison with other popular stimulants used by drivers. For\nexample, another study showed that coach drivers consumed an average of\n12 cups of caffeine per day on long-distance trips and, perhaps not surprisingly,\nalso showed signs of sleep disturbance, unwanted daytime sleepiness, and ele-\nvated stress hormones to compensate for fatigue debt (106). Exercise may com-\npare favorably with a progressive increasing use of such stimulants to reduce\nfatigue.\nOther research has used performance measures, such as reaction time, visual\ntracking, and other cognitive tasks, as indicators of fatigue and alertness. In a\nunique study involving haulage drivers (reference 34 cited in 93), investigators\nreported that after 90 min of manual lifting and moving boxes, instead of causing a\ndetrimental effect on performance as hypothesized, there was an initial invigorating\npositive effect on vigilance and response time to likely simulated crash situations.\nThe effect faded with time. Following an afternoon manual loading\/unloading\nsession, performance deteriorated discernibly but returned to baseline near the\nend of the day. This suggests that exercise may have different effects at different\ntimes of the day within a circadian cycle. The daily manual tasks (morning and\nafternoon) took place within a daily schedule of 14 h on\/10 h off (with 12 h of\ndriving), with a weekend rest\/recovery period of 58 h between successive weeks\nfollowing the study protocol. The researchers reported that following the manual\nroutine, the drivers tended to sleep longer on the first night of the weekend. The\nstudy should be replicated with more careful monitoring of exercise intensity\nby using heart rate monitors and fitness measures to determine relative physical\nworkload.\nFinally, aging research on the protective role of exercise on cognitive decline\nand impairment is rapidly gaining momentum (6, 31, 44, 75, 97). The transfer\nof evidence to the context of driving would be speculative at present, but several\nplausible mechanisms may explain how inactivity results in cognitive impairment:\nExercise may improve cerebral blood flow and neuronal growth and positively\naffect other risk factors for cognitive decline such as stress hormones, lipids, insulin\nlevels, and immune function.\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\n2.12 TAYLOR \u0001 DORN\nHEALTH STATUS AND DRIVER PERFORMANCE:\nEFFECTS OF (IN)ACTIVITY\nHealth status has an impact on the safety of drivers (46). More than 300 fatal two-\nvehicle trailer-truck accidents were investigated in one study (47). The probability\nof being principally responsible for an accident increased by a factor of 3.5 if the\ndriver had a chronic illness. One study (62) reported that drivers with cardiovascular\ndisease were twice as likely to have an accident and be at fault than were healthy\ndrivers. In other studies, diabetic heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers were more\nlikely to have an accident than were nondiabetic HGV drivers (19, 72). Chronic\nmedical conditions have also been associated with increased accident involvement\namong older drivers (52). There is no research on the effects of depression on\ndriver risk, although recent evidence suggests that depression influences cognitive\nfunctioning (i.e., attentional processes) (32).\nFurther work is needed to understand how physical and mental health statuses\ninfluence risk of driver accidents. In a cohort study of 10,525 New Zealand men and\nwomen, obese drivers were twice as likely to have an accident (120a), although in\nconsidering the public health impact of obesity, these effects have typically not been\nconsidered (e.g., 13, 116). Much has been written about sleep apnea syndrome and\ndriver safety, and a reduction in obesity, through lifestyle management (including\nphysical activity), could reduce the problem (91). Another possibility may be\nthrough pharmacological mechanisms that impair driver alertness and information\nprocessing. There is also the potential for unwanted sleepiness in drivers using\ncertain over-the-counter medicines such as antihistamines, opioid analgesics, and\nmuscarinic antagonists (55), but little is known about the effects of physical activity\non pharmokinetics (66).\nFinally, in the United Kingdom, a figure of more than 18 million days of sickness\nabsence is attributable to obesity and its consequences. The National Audit Office\n(89) has estimated that obesity-related costs are \u00a3135 million (\u223c$237 million)\nfor hypertension, \u00a3127 million (\u223c$223 million) for coronary heart disease, and\n\u00a3124 million (\u223c$218 million) for Type 2 diabetes. Diabetic employees are likely\nto use 32 days per year of sickness absence, whereas nondiabetic employees used\n17 days (103). We are not aware of any attempt to estimate the implications of\nabsenteeism (or indeed premature retirement due to ill health) on occupational\nstress (resulting from greater work demands placed on those remaining at work);\nthis probably has significant consequences for driver safety in the transport industry\nwhere there is often a shortage of skilled workers.\nChronic and Acute Exercise, Health Status, and Accident Risk\nMore than 50 years ago, it was first reported that less-active London bus drivers\nhad a higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) than did more-active bus con-\nductors (85, 94). It is now clear that regular physical activity is beneficial for many\ndimensions of health, well-being, and quality of life, with a particular concern for\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ROAD ACCIDENTS 2.13\nphysical inactivity and obesity (17, 113). Inactive and less-fit people, compared\nwith physically active and more-fit people, are almost twice as likely to die from\ncardiovascular disease (5). From a public health perspective, the greatest protec-\ntive effects are likely to be seen from an increase in physical activity among the\nleast active and least fit. Physical activity at an intensity of 4\u20136 METS (1 unit of\nmetabolic energy expenditure is equivalent to sleeping) (equivalent to brisk walk-\ning) is adequate for reducing the risk of CHD (88) and stroke (119). This can be\nachieved from an accumulation of short sessions (i.e., 3 \u00d7 10 min per day) on\nmost days of the week.\nPhysical inactivity is a major risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes\n(64). Regular walking and cycling is sufficient to reduce the risk for Type 2 dia-\nbetes (59, 119) with each increment of 500 kcal in weekly energy expenditure (e.g.,\n90 min of brisk walking) associated with a 6% decrease in the age-adjusted risk (up\nto 3500 kcal\/week\u22121). The number of hours of inactivity, such as television watch-\ning (independent of exercise), is strongly associated with risk of diabetes (58).\nThis finding places those in sedentary occupations such as driving at considerably\ngreater risk. Indeed, physical activity may be a more important contributor to Type 2\ndiabetes prevention than dietary change alone, but both are important.\nChronic low back pain (CLBP) is a major reason for absenteeism. Inactivity,\nparticularly with poor posture (96), is a major risk factor for the development of\nCLBP, and chronic exercise (involving flexibility, strengthening, endurance, and\ncore stability activities) appears to have a protective effect (118).\nIn summary, physical inactivity has become so endemic in industrialized coun-\ntries, and particularly among certain occupational groups such as professional\ndrivers (49, 70), that the overall population attributable risk for CHD in particular\n(and possible other conditions) is greater than any other lifestyle risk factor. The\ncontribution of physical inactivity on driver health status as an important risk factor\nfor accidents has not previously been considered in the literature (13).\nIMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTIONS\nIncreasing physical activity may be particularly challenging among professional\ndrivers owing to variable shift work, demanding occupational schedules and stress-\ninduced fatigue, lethargy from being sedentary, and a social culture that often rein-\nforces physical inactivity (35). Physical activity interventions, aimed at changing\npredisposing factors (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, and values), reinforcing factors (e.g.,\nattitudes of line managers, union representatives, and occupational health workers),\nand enabling factors (e.g., opportunities to cycle, leave bikes and shower at work,\nuse an exercise facility while traveling, have flexible shifts to facilitate more phys-\nical activity, and provide financial incentives for more active lifestyles) (41, 110),\ncan be effective (63). Yet there has been a conspicuous absence of interest in the\nrole of exercise in work place health and accident risk among professional drivers\n(20, 43, 101).\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\n2.14 TAYLOR \u0001 DORN\nIn a Swedish study, counseling by physicians led to significant increases in phys-\nical activity after 6 months among 69 professional drivers (29, 30). The drivers\nranked exercise first among several lifestyle changes as a way in which they could\ninfluence their own well-being (51). Both a health profile assessment (including in-\ndividualized counseling) and a health examination were associated with increases\nin aerobic fitness and physical activity and a reduction in total cholesterol and per-\nceived stress up to the 18-month follow-up. Availability of variable working hours\nwas the most common obstacle to changing a health habit. Finally, a review of 13\nstudies was conducted that involved stress prevention interventions for bus drivers\n(68). Physical activity was identified as a major component (within a multifaceted\nintervention) in only two studies, both involving bus drivers. Fitness training and\nan informational course, respectively, appeared to reduce absenteeism, but it is im-\npossible to apportion effects to any specific component of the intervention. Driver\nwellness programs are emerging for both small and large companies (33), and the\nsystematic evidence reviewed here can help underpin their scope and implemen-\ntation. Certainly, drivers have identified physical inactivity, weight, fatigue, poor\ndiet, and stress as priority concerns.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, there are several ways in which increased physical activity may\nimprove driving performance and potentially reduce accident risk. These include\neffects on the following: stress and psychological and physiological responses;\nenhanced sleep and alertness, reduced fatigue, and improved cognitive functioning;\nand enhanced psychological and physical health status. There is sufficient global\nevidence that professional drivers are less active than is the general population. To\ntest the beneficial effects of physical exercise, research is needed at four levels:\n1. Epidemiological studies are needed to identify relationships between phys-\nical activity levels and driver stress, fatigue, sleep, health status, and ac-\ncidents among specific subgroups of professional drivers (e.g., local bus\ndrivers, long-distance coach drivers, HGV drivers, company car drivers,\netc.). An economic evaluation of the potential financial implications of\nphysical (in)activity among specific professional drivers would follow.\n2. Intervention studies are needed to examine the effects of chronic exercise\non driver performance in natural and controlled settings (e.g., using driving\nsimulators), particularly for drivers who report high stress, poor sleep, and\npoor health status.\n3. Studies are needed that examine the acute effects of exercise (in different\ndoses, intensity, and duration, but particularly behaviours such as walking,\nwhich are convenient and likely to be adopted) on simulated driving per-\nformance, particularly among drivers who report high stress, poor sleep,\nand poor health status.\n13 Aug 2005 20:33 AR ANRV269-PU27-02.tex XMLPublishSM(2004\/02\/24)\nP1: OJO\/OAH\n\/OJO P2:\nGBC\/OJO\nAR REVIEWS IN ADVANCE10.1146\/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102117\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ROAD ACCIDENTS 2.15\n4. There is a need for research that examines the effectiveness of driver work\nsite interventions (to promote physical activity) to determine how best to\npromote physical activity to groups of professional drivers through multi-\nlevel interventions (at the organizational structure, work site environments,\nand individual levels).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the U.K. government\u2019s Department for Transport (Road Safety\nDivision) for their support of this work.
