For \npatients, its defects are most starkly apparent in the high suicide rate of approximately \none thousand per year among those recently in contact with mental health services \n(Appleby, 1997).  For the general public, the defects of community care are most \nvividly portrayed in the homicides committed by mentally disordered people, on \naverage, forty per year (Taylor and Gunn, 1999).  Recently, there have been major \npolicy and practice shifts, with an increasing emphasis on using coercion and \ntargeting services on those who are assessed as dangerous.   This policy has been \nheavily criticised by mental health professionals who have argued that violent patients \nform a very small sub-section and efforts would be better directed at improving care \nfor all (Eastman, 1997, Leff, 1997, Taylor and Gunn, 1999). \n \nMethodology \n \nThe study reported in this paper examined the public inquiries held after homicides \nbecause they have had a major influence on both public opinion and government \npolicy.  A few, well-publicised, inquiries were held in the 1980s but the majority have \nbeen conducted since1994 when the Department of Health decided that  \u2018in cases of \nhomicide, it will always be necessary to hold an inquiry which is independent of the \nproviders involved\u2019 (NHS Executive, 1994).  These inquiries examine the quality of \ncare the patient received to see what lessons can be learned about reducing the future \nrisk of violence.  Each looks at a particular tragedy, but the set of reports needs to be \nstudied as a whole to identify recurrent failings or lessons.   \n \n 3\nThe media attention given to these reports has helped to make violence a central issue \nin policy debates, but our study questioned to what extent the detailed findings of \nthese inquiries support the current changes in policy.  In particular, the analysis \nfocused on the findings relating to whether the homicides were deemed to have been \neither predictable or preventable and what recommendations were made on reducing \nviolence. \n \nAnalysis was made of the findings of the inquiries into homicides by mentally \ndisordered offenders in Britain. Since no official list of inquiries existed, we used \ninformation supplied by the Zito Trust who have been trying to keep a comprehensive \nrecord. The sample comprised all reports published between 1988 and 1997, a total of \n40 reports. One other report was identified but efforts to obtain a copy were \nunsuccessful. Only 5 of these reports were published before 1994 when there was a \nsharp increase because inquiries after homicides became mandatory 'to \u2018protect the \npublic and patients\u2019 ( NHS Executive, 1994).  A large number of inquiries set up since \n1994 had still failed to publish a report by 1997, hence our total sample was far lower \nthan the number of homicides by mentally disordered offenders during that period. \n \nAs recommended in the guidance from the NHS Executive (1994), all the inquiries \nexamined the following topics: \n\u2022 the care the patient was receiving at the time of the incident; \n\u2022 the suitability of that care in view of the patient\u2019s history and assessed health \nand social needs; \n\u2022 the extent to which that care corresponded with statutory obligations, relevant \nguidance  from the Department of Health, and local operational   policies; \n 4\n\u2022 the exercise of professional judgement; \n\u2022 the adequacy of the care plan and its monitoring by the key worker. \n \nThe inquiry panels varied in the balance of professionals represented, particularly \nbetween psychiatry and law. The reports also varied in length and detail and, it might \nbe argued, in quality. However, this study did not re-examine the evidence or criticise \nthe conclusions but analysed the published findings since it is these, however fallible, \nthat have been influencing policy makers. Analysis was made of the judgements about \nwhether the homicides had been predictable and\/or preventable.    Inquiries generally \nmade a clear statement about the predictability of the violence. For example \"the \ninquiry records that there was no evidence to indicate that Mr B. was a risk to persons \nother than himself \u201c (Chapman, Ashman,  Oyebode et al, 1996, p.20) or \" this relapse \nwas predictable, as was the increased risk of violence that accompanied it\u201d (Crawford, \nDevaux, Ferris et al, 1997, p.103).   \n \nMost reports also made a judgement about whether the homicide could have been \navoided. This included most of the cases where the violence could have been \npredicted but also some cases where the inquiries concluded that, although the \nviolence was unpredictable, the professionals could have predicted that the patient \nwould become ill again and that, if he or she had received a reasonable standard of \ntreatment, the homicide would have been prevented.  For instance, \"we are \nsympathetic to the fact that Kenneth Grey killing his mother could not be predicted \nbut are convinced that steps could have been taken which might have prevented it \nfrom happening\" (Mishcon, Dick, Welch et al, 1995, p.6.   Reports where the \nhomicide was not judged preventable fell into two categories: those where there was a \n 5\njudgement that they were not preventable and those where there was no clear \ncomment on the matter.  For the purpose of our analysis, where the focus was on \nthose considered preventable, these were grouped together. \n were classified as  \u2018not judged preventable\u2019. \nIn analysing predictions of risk, attention was also paid to whether the predictive \nfactors were long-standing or recent since this has relevance for case management.  \nAny risk assessment is related to a particular point in time and patients' ratings will \nvary over time.  So a patient who is classified as very dangerous at one time may, \nafter treatment or changes in his environment, be considered a much lower risk. In \nexamining the statements about the predictability of the violence in the reports, there \nwere clear differences in the patients\u2019 histories.  Some had a fluctuating history in \nwhich there had been episodes when they were considered high risk. Others had never \ncaused significant concern on this point until immediately before the homicide was \ncommitted. Some patients had never given any indication that they might be violent \neven immediately prior to the homicide. Christopher Clunis, for instance, (Ritchie, \nDick and Lingham, 1994) clearly fitted the first category, with a history of violence \nand a relapsing illness whereas Philip McFadden had never been assessed as \ndangerous in the past but displayed acute indicators of violence in the days preceding \nthe homicide (Aronson and Dyer, 1995). James Stemp, on the other hand, is an \nexample of the third category.  He, at no time, presented \u2018as someone who posed a \nsignificant risk either to himself or to others.\u2019 (Adams, Douglas, McIntegart et al, \n1997, p.20) \n \n 6\nIn our analysis, we classified a history of violence or high risk assessments as \u2018long \nterm\u2019 indicators of violence and the signs and symptoms displayed immediately prior \nto the violence as \u2018imminent\u2019 indicators.   \n \nWe used the inquiry panel\u2019s judgement of whether the patient displayed long term \nand\/or imminent indicators of violence.  This usually coincided with the judgement of \nprofessionals involved in the case but, if there were any disagreement, it was in that \ninquiries found more risk indicators.  \n \nA characteristic of risk assessments is that they involve estimating a probability - a \ndegree of risk.  Patients are not classified into two distinct categories of safe and \ndangerous.  A patient who has been extremely violent may never be classified as a \nzero risk but may be considered safe enough to be released into the community.  The \nSinclair Report (Lingham, Candy and Bray, 1996) uses the graphic image of a \u2018ladder \nof dangerousness\u2019 up and down which a patient may move.  So, when, in our analysis, \na report is classified as having concluded that the homicide was predictable, it means \nthat the inquiry panel thought that the probability of violence, at that time, was high \nenough to warrant action by professionals to try and avert it.  \n \nFindings \n  \nPredictability of homicide \n \nEleven inquiries (27.5 %) concluded that the violence could have been predicted and \ntwenty nine (72.5%) considered there had been insufficient evidence to alert \n 7\nprofessionals.  Twenty four (60 %) of the patients had a history of violence or high \nrisk factors for violence but in only eight did the inquiries consider there was evidence \nfor judging them to be high risk at the time of the homicide.  Sixteen patients who had \nlong term indicators of violence did not show any imminent signs to indicate that their \nstate of mind was changing significantly. \n \nIn three of the cases that were considered predictable, the patients had shown signs \nand symptoms indicative of risk only in the days preceding the homicide.  Until that \npoint, there had been no serious concern about their dangerousness in their history.  \nThirteen patients showed neither long-term nor imminent indicators of risk. \n \nSee figures I and II \n \n \nPreventability of the homicide \n \nTwenty-six cases (65%) were considered to have been preventable.  This included \nnine of the eleven cases deemed to have been predictable.  In the other two cases \nconsidered predictable, the high risk of violence had, in fact, been recognised.  In one \ncase (Richardson, Chiswick and Nutting, 1997), the inquiry agreed with the \nprofessionals that they had no legal power to intervene since the patient did not have a \nmental disorder that made him detainable under the Mental Health Act.  In the other \ncase (Aronson and Dyer, 1995), police were sent to the house to take the patient to \nhospital and he killed one of them.   \n \n 8\nThere was, however, a large group of seventeen cases where inquiries concluded that \nthe homicides had been preventable but this was not through better risk assessment \nbut through a better level of psychiatric care in general.  The violence itself was not \npredictable but a relapse could have been and, with a reasonable standard of care, \nshould have been predicted so that the patient would not have been in the community \nin such a disordered state at the time of the homicide.  The Norman Dunn inquiry \nreport provides a classic example of this category: \n \nTwo questions arise.  The first is \u2013 could anyone have foreseen that Norman \nwould have been so violent that he caused his mother to die? The answer, the \nInquiry is quite certain, must be no, never.  The second, however, is \u2013 could \nthis tragedy have been prevented?  The answer, the Inquiry is equally certain, \nmust be yes, most definitely. Those who were professionally responsible and \ndirectly concerned in the case of Norman in the community had not noticed \nthe deterioration observed by others.  Had they done so, there is little doubt \nthat he would have been admitted to hospital and the symptoms of his illness \ncorrected. Norman would have been spared the further deterioration that \noccurred, his symptoms would have been more easily resolved, his family \nwould have been spared the burden of coping with him in his ill state, and the \nattack on Mrs M. would never have occurred (Keating, Collins and Walmsley. \n1997, p.107.) \n \nCorrelating preventability with patient history, sixteen (66%) cases of those with \nlong-term indicators and nine (56%) of those with no long-term factors were judged \npreventable homicides.   \n 9\n \nDiscussion \n \nThese findings suggest that more homicides could be prevented by improving the \nresponse to patients who start to relapse, regardless of their assessed potential for \nviolence, than by trying to identify high risk patients and target resources on them.  \nAccording to the inquiries, improved risk assessment would have identified eleven of \nthe forty cases and the homicides could have been prevented in only nine of them.  \nSeventeen other deaths could have been prevented if professionals had responded \nmore efficiently to signs that the patients were relapsing, although they gave no clear \nsigns that their illness would include violent behaviour on this occasion.   \n \nConcern for public safety has been taking political precedence over concern for the \nwelfare of those suffering from mental disorders.  With this priority, it might seem, at \nfirst glance, plausible to argue that, at a time of limited resources, it is best to focus \nthem on those patients posing the greatest threat to the public.  But these findings \nshow (a) those showing long term signs of dangerousness are only a subsection of \nthose who are violent, (b) even those fitting this category do not always show \nimminent signs that they are about to be violent, and, (c) there are a substantial group \nof people who display none of the accepted indicators of violence before committing \nhomicide.   \n \nImproving risk assessment \n \n 10\nIt might be argued that the solution lies in improving our ability to assess risk.  This, \nhowever, is unlikely to lead to substantial increased safety for the public. The finding \nthat only 27.5% of the homicides were predictable is not surprising in the light of \nother evidence about professionals\u2019 ability to predict the rare incidents of violence. \nExisting risk assessment instruments have low accuracy.  Menzies, Webster, McMain \net al. (1994, p.25) evaluated the predictive validity of two rating scales with \ndisappointing results, leading them to conclude:  \u2018the objective of a standardised, \nreliable, generalizable set of criteria for dangerous predictions, in law and in mental \nhealth, is still an elusive and distant objective\u2019 . \n \nFurther empirical research on indicators of risk may help to improve predictive skills, \ne.g. the large-scale MacArthur Risk Assessment Study now being conducted in the \nUSA is studying the association between risk factors and violent behaviour and aims: \n\u2018to improve the validity of clinical risk assessment\u2019 (Steadman, Monahan, Appelbaum \net al, 1996)  However, improving accuracy is difficult and it is unrealistic to expect \nrisk assessments to achieve high accuracy.   \n \nEmpirical studies to improve the knowledge base face methodological difficulties, \nsummarised by Monahan: \n \nFour methodological problems have especially plagued actuarial research on \nthe assessment of the potential of the mentally disordered for violence: \ninadequacy of cues or factors chosen to forecast whether violence will occur, \ninability to determine the extent of violence within the population studied, \n 11\nlimited applicability of research designs used to validate risk factors, and \nfailure to coordinate research efforts in the field  (1996, p.7). \n \nThe MacArthur Risk Assessment Study is designed to minimise these problems but, \nwhile its findings may improve knowledge of risk factors, it is unlikely to lead to \nhighly accurate risk predictions because homicides are so rare.  The statistics of \npredicting relatively rare events, such as violence in those with mental disorders, \nmean that it is extremely difficult to achieve a predictive system with high accuracy.  \nEven a test with high sensitivity and specificity will produce a high number of false \npositives (Campbell and Machin, 1990, Munro, 1999).   \n \nEthical problems \n \nThe fallibility of risk assessments has ethical as well as clinical implications.  A false \npositive may lead to a non-violent patient being detained while a false negative may \ndeprive someone of needed help.  When professionals failed to assess Christopher \nClunis\u2019 potential for violence accurately, both he and his victim suffered an injustice, \nJonathan Zito in being killed and Christopher Clunis in not being given the care and \ntreatment he so needed.  When decisions have to be made in conditions of uncertainty, \npolicy makers have to decide on the relative importance of false positives and false \nnegatives (Hammond, 1996). \n \nThe threshold for professional intervention will vary according to the acceptability of \neach type of error.  The Taylor-Russell diagram (1939) helps to illustrate this.  The \ntwo axes measure the true degree of danger and the professional assessment of risk.  If \n 12\nrisk assessment were a perfect science, we would expect cases to fall in a straight line \nwith real and identified risk being the same (figure III).  However, since we only have \nfallible measures, cases will fall in an ellipse (figure IV); the less accurate the \ndiagnostic system, the bigger the scatter.  Having estimated the probability of \nviolence, professionals then have to make a decision about the threshold for \nintervention: how high should the risk be before they intervene?  If we draw a line to \nindicate the threshold, the rate of false positives and false negatives becomes \napparent.  A low threshold for action produces a high rate of false positives (figure V) \nwhile, conversely, a high threshold leads to a high number of false negatives (figure \nVI).   \n \nDecisions about the threshold for intervention are separate from estimations of the \nprobability of a particular outcome. The issue is clearly illustrated in the two \nstandards of proof in legal system.  \u2018Beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 is a high threshold, \nminimising the number of innocent people who will be wrongly convicted, while \u2018on \nthe balance of probabilities\u2019 is a lower threshold, reducing the number of false \nnegatives. \n \nIn mental health work, pressure from the public and politicians to avoid false \nnegatives (violence by people with mental disorders) is pushing the threshold for \naction down.  This, inevitably, has the logical consequence of increasing the number \nof false positives, patients inaccurately assessed as dangerous.  This raises ethical \nconcerns about erosion of patients\u2019 civil liberties, especially as the trend appears to be \nfor increasingly coercive measures both in the community and in hospitals. \n \n 13\nAt a practical level, lowering the threshold for intervention increases the total number \nof patients assessed as significantly high risk.  In a chronically under-funded service, \nthis has the repercussion of reducing the resources available for patients who do not \nfall into the category of being potentially violent.  Ethical concerns can then be raised \nabout those who are ill but are denied services because they are considered to pose no \ndanger to the public. \n \nBalancing welfare and safety in child care \n \nThe dangers of trying to meet the public\u2019s unrealistic expectations of professional \nskill in risk assessment and management are well illustrated by Britain\u2019s child \nprotection system (Munro, 1999).  Here, the understandable public concern to prevent \nchildren\u2019s deaths at the hands of their abusive parents led professionals to adopt a low \nthreshold for intervention in order to minimise false negatives, that is, missing \nchildren at high risk.  The low threshold led to high numbers of false positives,  \ninaccurately assessing families as dangerous.  This led to a backlash against the power \nof professionals to intervene in family life, exemplified by the public outrage at events \nin Cleveland when a large number of children were removed from home on suspicion \nof being sexually abused.  \n \nFaced with public pressure to avoid any type of error, professionals tried to maximise \ntheir accuracy by conducting extremely thorough investigations into any allegations \nof abuse.  This focus on investigations has had two highly undesirable outcomes.  It \nhas caused considerable distress and damage to the families, abusive or not, who are \nsubject to them (Farmer and Owen, 1995).  It has also absorbed so much of the \navailable resources that other parts of the child welfare system are suffering, even \n 14\nservices for the children identified by the investigations as at risk (Audit Commission, \n1994, Dept. of Health, 1995). \n \nPublic perception of risk \n \nAnother argument against the current trend in mental health services of becoming \nincreasingly concerned with assessing risk and targeting resources on those deemed to \nbe at high risk of violence is that public perception of the risk of violence from people \nwith mental disorders is greatly exaggerated.  Taylor and Gunn (1999) have analysed \nthe data on homicides between 1957 and 1995 and shown that, contrary to common \nmyth, there has been no increase in the homicide rate since the policy of community \ncare was implemented.   They also help to put the incidence of these homicides in \ncontext. Compared with about 40 homicides by the mentally ill per year, \u2018the public is \nat risk from 600-700 offences per year recorded by the police as homicide, an \nadditional 300 killings by dangerous, drunken or drugged driving or \u201caggravated \nvehicle taking\u201d (not included in the official homicide figures) and of the order of \n3500-4000 deaths per year in incidents recorded as \u201caccidents\u201d on the roads alone\u2019 \n(1999, p.10).  \n \nCoid (1996, p.965) cites evidence that rates of homicide by mentally disordered \npeople are remarkably similar in all countries, in stark contrast to overall rates of \nhomicide which vary dramatically.  He suggests that, since Britain has a relatively low \nrate of homicide, those by the mentally disordered stand out more than in other \ncountries and so receive more attention.  This certainly fits with the priority given in \nBritain to examining each case in depth, contrasting with the USA, with a \n 15\nsubstantially higher homicide rate, where the homicides by mentally disordered \nreceive little official study. \n \nMental health services have a dual commitment to maximise the welfare of patients \nand to protect the public from harm.  The policy of community care has, for most \npatients, led to improved quality of life though the level of funding has meant that \nthey have not received an optimum level of care and treatment.  Treatment in the \ncommunity rather than in isolated institutions has, however, made people with mental \ndisorders more visible to the general public.  Their behaviour can, at times, appear \nstrange and frightening.  They can actually be violent, usually to themselves but, very \noccasionally, to others.  Their victims are usually relatives or professionals known to \nthem, with only 13% being strangers (Taylor and Gunn, 1999, p.13).    \n \nAs the public inquiries show, there are serious obstacles to increasing public safety by \nimproving risk assessment and targeting services on those deemed potentially violent. \nMental health professionals have limited ability to predict rare incidents of violence.  \nHowever, they have considerable skill in diagnosing and treating mental illness. The \npublic would be better protected by having a good standard of care for all patients. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16\n \n \n \nClinical implications \n\u2022 More homicides could be prevented by good mental health care which \ndetected relapse earlier that would be averted by attempts at better risk \nassessment and management. \n\u2022 Risk assessments are fallible.  If professionals react to public pressure by \ntrying to avoid false negatives, they will lower the threshold for intervention, \nleading to an increase in false positives.  This raises ethical concerns about \npatients who are wrongly detained or treated against their will. \n\u2022 Targeting limited resources on those deemed potentially violent may lead to \nserious injustices to people who are seriously ill but pose no danger. \n \nLimitations \n\u2022 The study analyses inquiries\u2019 subjective judgements about predictability and \npreventability which may be inaccurate.  However, the findings of some of \nthese inquiries, whatever their reliability, have been very influential in policy \nformation.  Therefore , it is valuable to consider the total set to find out \nwhether the influential reports are representative. \n\u2022 The concept of \u2018preventable\u2019 used by inquiries makes implicit reference to a \nconcept of  \u2018a reasonable standard of practice\u2019 that needs to be clarified. \n\u2022 The sample of 40 comprises only those inquiries that had published by \nDecember 1997.  Many more are in progress or have been published since \nthen and their findings could usefully be studied. \n 17\nReferences \n \nAdams J, Douglas P, McIntegart J. et al.
