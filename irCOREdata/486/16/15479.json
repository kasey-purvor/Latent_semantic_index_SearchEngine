Through the process of curating the exhibition An \nArchaeology of Race (http:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/geography\/race\/) there have emerged new modes of knowing this \nlandscape through a lens of mapping race. This paper will engage with the narrative form as a tool of doing \npostcolonial history of the northern frontier defined by Hadrian\u2019s Wall. The latter section of the paper \nfocuses on the exhibition which consolidates a narrative which is situated in the nexus of material cultures, \narchaeological scholarship and critical race-geography. The aim here is to present the \u2018black\u2019 history of this \nheritage landscape situated within the political context of doing archaeologies of landscape (Witcher et al, \n2010). This approach highlights the international geographies and cultures that accumulate at this monument \nin the form of a public exhibition. \nKEYWORDS: Landscape, Race, Exhibition, Heritage, Septimius Severus, Archaeology, Narrative \n \n2 | P a g e  \n \n \nNARRATING THE POSTCOLONIAL LANDSCAPE: ARCHAEOLOGIES OF RACE AT HADRIAN\u2019S WALL \nArchaeologies of Race, Blackness and the \u2018Aethiope\u2019 \nVarious temporalities are embedded in the landscape of Hadrian\u2019s Wall, some privileged over others in both \npopular heritage and academic histories. In this paper a critical postcolonial approach is taken to the \narchaeological and geographical narratives linked to this site. These interrogations have led to dissemination \nof this re-narritivisation, in the form of a museum exhibition entitled An Archaeology of Race \n(http:\/\/dur.ac.uk\/geography\/race\/) curated by Claire Nesbitt and myself. This major exhibition was linked to \nthe AHRC funded project entitled Tales of the Frontier: postcolonial readings of Hadrian\u2019s Wall \n(htt:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/roman.centre\/hadrianswall\/), where the geographical and archaeological landscape \ncultures of this monument were interrogated using a postcolonial lens. The exhibition embodies a political \nproject of public engagement and public geographies in practice (Fuller, 2008). In summer 2009, 11,000 \nvisitors attended the exhibition and the website received over 500 hits a week. The exhibition in practice \nattends to a narrative of British landscape by embracing a postcolonial frame, which embodies heritage for all \n(DCMS, 1999). There is a politics to linking theories of anti-racism into a publicly engaged practice. As Madge \net.al (2009) argue academics whose expertise is built on postcolonial, critical race-theory or indeed radical \ncultural geography do need to extend their politics beyond the page, towards an \u2018ethics in praxis\u2019 (Raghuram et \nal 2009; Tolia-Kelly, 2009). Here, what is presented is an attempt at keeping heritage dynamic and live, a \npolitics of doing public geographies (Ward, 2006) with care (Fuller and Askins, 2007; Fuller, 2008) and \nresponsibility (Jazeel and Mcfartlane, 2010). This commitment has enabled the narrative events to which the \nmuseums, curators and scholars who have collaborated on in An archaeology of Race to be kept alive through \nthe teaching on citizenship in schools, the free web access to the exhibition panels, as well as the touring \nexhibition that continues in Durham University museums in October 2010. Each contact with folk thus \nengenders a re-imagining, re-narrating and re-membering our historical past which feeds into our present and \ninclusive landscapes narratives of nation. \n3 | P a g e  \n \nThe re-narrativisation in the exhibition includes the representing of \u2018black\u2019 history along this fortified frontier. \nThe exhibition evidences the mobilities and presence of international personnel, including the black African \npresence, situating this UNESCO world heritage site as part of an international Roman limes. Also presented \nare the movement of technologies, materials, peoples and cultures within Roman territory. \u2018black\u2019 in this \npaper refers to the political definition of black as \u2018other\u2019, non-Occidental, and in terms of history and heritage \nthe narration of those histories that are marginalised, occluded and often re-presented. The exhibition\u2019s \nnarrative addresses questions of nation and race (Crampton, 2003). Narrative here is considered here as \nalways interpretive, partial and in-process (Hayden-White, 1978). Through narrative, the exhibition, counters \ninterpretations of the landscape through an Imperial British identity in the 19th century, particularly an \nOrientalist account (Said, 1979; 1993); \u2018(T)he main battle(s) in imperialism . . . were reflected, contested, an \neven for a time decided in narrative\u2019 (1993, xiii), thus narrative becomes a tool for a political, historical and \ncultural ideologyy in the recording of landscape history. \nAn Archaeology of Race aims to address how a post colonial engagement with the material cultures, landscape \nand iconography, can unravel the layerings of narratives of \u2018strangers\u2019, \u2018others\u2019, and \u2018blackness\u2019, a project at \nthe heart of Hall\u2019s (1999) call for a renewed cultural heritage narrative of nation that challenges those \nvalorised cultural narratives that subsume the \u2018other\u2019 (Said, 1983,12), sometimes violently (Said 1983, 47). The \nintention has been to avoid the compounding of contemporary notions of \u2018race\u2019 with Greco-Roman political \nand representational culture. The politics of landscape and race are represented within the exhibition panels, \nwritten by scholars in the field. My aim has been threefold; firstly to attempt a recovery of the fact of black \npresence in an early British landscape of the north-east, thus disturbing those accepted notions of this \nlandscape being one that is homogeneous and remote both culturally and geopolitically. The figuring of \nSeptimius Severus as an African Emperor of Rome living in the North and rebuilding the Wall as part of his \nconsolidation of the northern frontier recovers a story for the public imagination, local landscape history and \ncontributes to a schedule of teaching on Roman Britain as part of the citizenship curriculum in schools. \nSeverus here is positioned as a black figure in British history. Despite the several great museums within the \nregion, both, national and international perspectives on the empire has been consolidated in a \n4 | P a g e  \n \nrepresentational field that privileges \u2018whiteness\u2019 (Dyer, 1997; Bonnett, 1997). Romaness as both Black and \nAfrican are seemingly discordant within this regime of heritage narratives. To rearticulate this multicultural \nhistory and to reclaim some ground here, citizenship, race and Roman history have been developed into a \nteaching pack for schools and scheduled on their \u2018citizenship\u2019 curriculum. These were sponsored by Durham \nCity Council\u2019s schools inspector for geography and history and written by the race equality in schools team, \n(EMTAS).  \nSecondly the postcolonial lens unravels the link between the role of archaeology as being instrumental in \nshaping narratives on the Wall as being part of a national programme of inherited and rightful Great \nBritishness, in the 19th century. The establishing the discipline of archaeology in this period, was \ncontemporary with the aligning of a culture of British Imperial greatness with the narratives of a successful \nImperial Rome (Hingley, 2000). The cultural and political process of coupling these in the national imaginary \neffectively conflate the British Imperial occidental project with that of Roman notions of citizenship and \ncivility. Overall, elisions are implied between those active geopolitical race hierarchies in the 19th century and \nRoman narratives of civic superiority. This is despite the dominant Classicist interpretation of Greco-Roman \nsocietal relations as being devoid of racial hierarchies (Snowden, 1970; 1983). Figures of blacks proliferate \nthroughout the Classical texts and material cultures, however, \u2018(T)he Greek and Roman profile of Ethiopians \nremained basically unchanged from Homer to the end of Classical literature-that image was essentially \nfavourable\u2019 (Snowden, 1983, 55). \u2018Ethiopians\u2019 in Snowden\u2019s terms designates persons of varying degrees of \nblackness, applied by Greeks and Romans to types of \u2018the Negroid race\u2019 (Snowden 1970,7). Thompson \n(1989) also attests that \u2018Roman attitudes towards Aethiopes even at their most negative, have nothing to do \nwith the familiar modern phenomenon of race and are of a kind very different from those commonly \ndescribed by social scientists by the terms \u2018racist\u2019, \u2018racial prejudice\u2019, \u2018colour prejudice\u2019 and \u2018racism\u2019. (157). \nThompson states that \u2018(T)he relevant iconography contains an element of caricature of blacks but in general \nthe representations of blacks (found mostly on small utilitarian objects like earrings and terracotta lamps) \nsuggests an absence of anti-black xenophobia and a tendency on the part of owners and users of these objects \nto take blacks for granted, at least in those localities where blacks were actually a familiar part of the social \n5 | P a g e  \n \nscene (in other localities the dominant suggestion would be a vogue for the exotic)\u2019 (1989,7). Unravelled in \nSnowden and Thompson\u2019s cultural frameworks are definable forms of race stereotyping in their discourses of \nstrangers (Ahmed, 2000), others (Said, 1979), and the exotic (Hall, 1997). Alongside these examples are several \ncritiques of Classical antiquarianism being implicated in a particular set of interpretations of artefacts through \na 19th century racialised lens (Isaac, 2004; Bernal, 1987). \nOver time the developing iconography of the Wall has come to define this as a national monument built by \nEmperor Hadrian, where the particular formation of ethnicities of Romaness undergo a whitening narrative \noccluding \u2018other\u2019 ethnic histories embedded in this landscape. Interestingly, both Hadrian and Septimius are \nmarked in terms of ethnicity and culture; Hadrian had Spanish links and held a deep love of Greek culture \nand Septimius was born an African in Libya, with all the education and training necessary to be seen to be of \nRoman (Latin) culture and citizenry (Birley, 2008). Both are celebrated Imperial civilisers in their own right. \nAs the formerly painted busts of Hadrian lose their aesthetic signifiers of identity, and the narrations of \nRoman Britain too become pale. This slow denudation of the complexity and diversity privileges certain 19th \nand 20th century cultural values as part of a new self-fashioning of Britishness. The effect of this enables \nHadrian to be ubiquitously celebrated as Roman Emperor and builder of the Wall, than the Severan legacy of \nmilitary rule and residency. \nThe role of archaeology in securing heritage and national landscape narratives, is not benign, this fact is \nexemplified in the consolidation of Israel as described by Nadia Abu El-Haj (2001), below  \n\u2018In producing the material signs of national history that became visible and were witnessed across the \ncontemporary landscape, archaeology repeatedly remade the colony into an ever expanding national terrain. It \nsubstantiated the nation in history and produced Eretz Yisrael as the national home\u2019 (2001, 280) \nThe frontier landscape of Hadrian\u2019s Wall is one where accounts of \u2018English\u2019 and \u2018British\u2019 heritage, landscape, \nand national culture are encountered in the Roman heritage tourism literature, in media images of Hadrian\u2019s \nWall, and the British Museums\u2019 own national touring exhibitions. The national landscape cultures of the \nRoman Wall garner questions of who is \u2018civil\u2019 and who is \u2018barbarian\u2019; who is savage and who is not, these are \n6 | P a g e  \n \nintrinsic to the history of Roman rule and the identities within this region; these have relied on colonial \naccounts of \u2018fixity\u2019 of identity (Bhabha, 1983) i.e. narrow accounts of \u2018Briton\u2019 and \u2018Roman\u2019. Narrations of \nnation are interwoven with systems of representations (Hall, 1997) forming historical \u2018regimes of truth\u2019 \n(Foucault, 1980, p131). The focus on race here is inevitably partial, yet remains an essential narrative, given \nthe effect on the British population when alienated from encounters with exclusive accounts of British \nhistory. Livingstone (2002, citing Gadamer) describes the moment of non-recognition thus \u2018(W)hen we \nencounter meanings not accessible or recognisable, results in a state of alienation\u2019 (2002,79; see also Hall, \n1999) The recognition of the detrimental effect of these fissures have given rise to several government \npolicies, in this area and initiatives such as Black History Month and heritage for all (Tolia-Kelly and Crang, \nforthcoming 2010). \nRomaness in narrations of the national past is often wrongly perceived to be a homogeneous culture explained \nthrough a (now contested) process of Romanisation (Haverfield, 1905). Celebrations of Roman Imperial \nstrength, and of both nation-building, and imperial civilising, are consolidated through historical and \nantiquarian accounts as well as in pictures, dioramas, re-enactments and heritage publicity. These public \nhistoriographies are distinctly bound up with the development of antiquarian societies themselves and of \narchaeological evidence becoming foundational to British history (Freeman, 1997, p45). Often when Romans \nare presented to us in the public sphere they are mediated through a particular British Imperialist ideological \nlens. However, there is contradiction between dominant accounts and other scholarship (Hingley and Unwin, \n2005) which has evidenced Romaness to be varied, challenging historical accounts and presented as competing \nhistorical accounts (Tenney 1916; Harrison, 1998; Gosden, 2006; Mattingly 1994, 1997; Millet, 1990). \nIncluded in these variations, are notions of the Roman Empire as having \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018periphery\u2019 cultures, or \neven a \u2018colour-blind\u2019 approach to cultural difference (race, religion, language and social background). These \ncolour-blind versions of Roman culture are also challenged by writers (Bernal 1987; D\u00edaz-Andreu, 2007; \nIsaac, 2004). Webster (2001) promotes a postcolonial theorisation in her account of creolisation that figures the \ncultural exchanges and expression between coloniser and colonised as being bound up in a process of \n\u2018resistant adaptation\u2019, where \u2018new ethnicities emerge to accommodate old and new\u2019 (p218). Creolisation, is \n7 | P a g e  \n \nradical in its attentiveness to the material cultures as well as those bodies outside of the lens of Roman \narchaeologists that have gone before. Webster (2001) challenges 19th century interpretations that ignore \ncultural exchange (Haverfield, 1905), as those which are figured around the elite (Hingley, 2000). \nScholarly accounts, texts and narrations of Roman society have themselves reflected the political context \nwithin which they are recorded; their histories are as significant as the history being told of. Thus the role of \nBritish Imperialism itself has shaped Roman history, as with any account of historical narration, the history \ntold is one narration of many that could be told. Despite published evidence (Allason-Jones, 1989) and \nscholarly works such as Anthony Birley\u2019s (2008 [1988]), accounts of ethnicity and migration continue buried \nin dominant narratives in the public domain. The exhibition\u2019s narrative attends to these processes of folding, \nloss and burial of accounts of mobility of peoples during Imperial rule and during colonisation, as a means to \nrecord a post-colonial race-geography of this British (UNESCO) World Heritage Site. Narrative in this regard \nis central to the presentation of history in the museum space, especially when there are contrary, complex \naccounts within academic scholarship.  \nNarrative and National History  \nTourist landscapes, archaeological sites and national identity are intrinsically co-narrated as part of national \nhistory, narrative powerfully operates beyond the economic and material site (Tuan, 1991). Contemporary \nwriters on these processes using a postcolonial approach (Harvey, 2003; 2007) have argued that the \u2018national\u2019 \nand \u2018history\u2019 often get skewed to fit a cultural reaction to a societies place in the world. For Hazbun (2008) \nreflecting on Carthagoland (a Hannibal inspired theme park) in Tunisia, argues that cultural spending is driven \nforward to claim a national identity using mythology to ensure \u2018a distinctive, territorially rooted identification \nfor the nation\u2019s external image.\u2019 (p70). The mythology here is that Hannibal has suited a current pluralistic \nagenda on national identity, which veers away from the definition of nation through \u2018Arab\u2019 or \u2018Islamic\u2019 \nidentities. In Britain too, both geography and archaeology have been at the heart of narrating national history, \nwhich includes mythologies; their disciplinary histories too have been consolidated as part of their role in this \nprocess in the 19th century in particular. Archaeology\u2019s role in narrating a national past through Roman \n8 | P a g e  \n \nmilitary landscapes has been at heart of its own formation and prominence as discipline nationally (Freeman, \n1997). The excavations of the Roman Wall by Henry Pelham, Theodore Momsen, and Francis Haverfield \npopularized the conception of Romanisation as a positive phenomenon (Hingley, 2000); \u2018Romanisation was \nthe process by which the uncivilized Briton (or European) achieved civilization\u2019 (p4) under imperial guidance. \nMomsen (cited in Mattingly, 1997, p31) argues for a Roman Empire which did not crave world dominion but \none that saw itself as a benevolent governor of the earth. This narration of a Roman past rendered this \nlandscape of civilized and barbarian as a metaphor for a notion of the greatness of Britishness abroad in its \nown colonies. Narrating the Wall as part of a British legacy re-orientated Roman culture towards a synthesis \nwith British Imperial \u2018ways of seeing\u2019 the world. \n As Daniels (1993) states the process of affirming a national landscape involves the rejection of constituencies \nof national subjects who are not culturally deemed part of a national citizenry in terms of language, origins, \ngenealogies and territorial roots and routes (Gilroy, 1991; Hall, 1999; Ahmed et al 2003; Nash, 2005). \n\u201cSince the eighteenth century painters and poets have helped narrate and depict national identity, or have \ntheir work commandeered to do so; scholars and professionals have been enlisted too: historians, map \nmakers, geographers, engineers, architects and archaeologists.\u2019 (Daniels, 1993, 5) \nHadrian\u2019s Wall, has engendered scholarship that has celebrated this site as integral to the currency of national \nlandscape.  The narration of Hadrian\u2019s Wall has shifted over time and its place in national heritage has been \nsecured through these varied landscape archaeologies (Witcher et al 2010). Narrative is therefore an important \ntool in \u2018storying our worlds into shape\u2019 (Daniels and Lorimer, 2009). In this research narrative does not sit \nbenignly in service to the material landscape or artefactual evidence, but actively shapes the encounter, \nexperience, cognition and comprehension of the landscape (Kong, 1999). Narrative is understood and \nbecomes phenomenon through a synergistic binding between representations, narrations, and the embodied \npractical experience of landscape and is orientated through often national historical framings (Said, 1990). \nCritical Narratives \n9 | P a g e  \n \nThe historical values and chronologies of the Wall have been recorded by Spartian, Bede (Gidley,1870), \nHerodian (Echols, 1961) and Camden (1806 [1586]), Skinner (1978 [1801]), Hutton (1802), and Thatcher \n(1921) these are some of the chroniclers of the Wall. There are continuous contentions over who built the \nWall over time: Hutton in 1802 reflects on the contrary historical narratives associated with the building of \nthe Wall, he states \u2018Agricola\u2019s name was lost in Hadrian\u2019s, so Severus, being superior to both, nearly eclipses \nboth, and the whole is frequently called Severus\u2019s Wall\u2019 (1802, 27). From being Severus\u2019s Wall, in the later 19th \ncentury the Wall\u2019s storying resonated with British Imperial ambitions (Bruce, 1996, 2).Contextual to this is the \nRomanticisation of heritage landscapes, what Darby (2000, 16) has termed \u2018cultural co modification of \nlandscape\u2019. It is in this period that the Hadrian\u2019s Wall Pilgrimage was begun in 1848 by John Collingwood \nBruce. Recounting his journey to fellows at the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries, his descriptions of the \nmagnificence of the Wall was met with doubt. Bruce proposed a communal journey; so began the social \njourney that was to become known as the Hadrian\u2019s Wall Pilgrimage. Birley termed it \u2018a sociable gossiping \naffair\u2019 (1961, 26), rather than to suggest a sacred journey. Bruce\u2019s speech at the beginning of the second is an \nexample of the role of this frontier landscape to evoke a sense of greatness through proximity to the \nachievements of the Roman Empire: \n\u2018The Roman Empire was an Empire of strength. As they [the pilgrims] run along the Wall they will learn, not \nonly somewhat of the character of mind of that people, but they will be stimulated to follow the example of \ntheir patience, perseverance, and their indomitable vigor... He could not help feeling that we are the \nsuccessors of the Romans. (1886, 2).  \nBoth narrative and landscape are constituted through and made meaning of in historical writing. De Certeau \n(1988) unravels the workings of historical narrative which can assist our readings of the history of the Roman \nWall. He attends to process, the inevitable contradictions in historical representations, and the limitations of \nthe writing form or an \u00e9criture (1988, p86). Narrative for de Certeau is  \n\u2018controlled by the practices from which it results; even more it is itself a social practice which establishes a \nwell-determined place for readers by redistributing the space of symbolic references any by pressing a \u2018lesson\u2019 \n10 | P a g e  \n \nupon them; it is didactic and magisterial. . . . It creates these narratives of the past which are equivalent of \ncemeteries within cities; it exorcises and confesses a presence of death amidst the living.\u2019 (1988, 88) \nIn the case of Hadrian\u2019s Wall, the contemporary historical narrative has celebrated a particular historical \nnarrative of Emperor Hadrian and a residual Romaness that belies the role of Severus and the nature of the \npresence of soldiery from across the globe based at the frontier (Breeze and Dobson, 2000). However, the \nform of historical narrative compounds these exclusions in the landscape encounter at the frontier; the visitor \nexperience is about being in the footsteps of Hadrian; see the advertisement below (The Guardian, 2008). \nINSERT Plate One: Get Closer to Rome. Head North.  \nINSERT Plate Two: The British Museum flyer for: Hadrian: Empire and Conflict. Life, Love, Legacy. 2008 \nThe representations of Hadrian above use a particular aesthetic; through the lighting and colour used, the \nEmperor is encountered as a positive being of greatness, with timeless power. Breeze (2006, 3), argues that \n\u2018Hadrian\u2019s Wall was built on the orders of Emperor Hadrian, who visited Britain in AD 122. His biographer \nstates it was to separate the Romans and the Barbarians. It certainly did that. . . . from about 160 for 250 years \nit remained the north-west frontier of the Roman empire\u2019. This empire stretched 1 500 miles south to the \nSahara desert and east to modern day Iraq. The Wall or international limes was a politically built artificial \nfrontier, to assert sovereignty, rule and governance, and to prevent breach from those \u2018others\u2019 who were not \npart of the \u2018civilized\u2019 citizenship of Rome. The whiteness of the marble compounds the narrative of Hadrian \nas closer to the culture of civilized Englishness as recognizable now.  \nNarrative is a helpful in my postcolonial critical account of the landscape history of the Roman Wall, in that it \nallows and enables a plural account in historical representation. Within archaeology authors such as Gosden \n(2004; 2006), Hingley (2000) use a postcolonial critique. Mattingly (1994) in particular is useful here as he \napproaches Roman Africa and produces a substantial thesis, based on empirical detail. The narrative form is \nof course one which enables oppositions which can be encountered, yet remain compatible. In An Archaeology \nof Race the landscape history of the Roman Wall is extended to think through the frontier as a whole. The \n11 | P a g e  \n \nhistories of which are interwoven. The frontier and the Wall are separate but are co-narrated to enable a geo-\npolitical postcolonial narration that signifies the race-geographies of the frontier, and narrated with \nresponsibility (Raghuram et al 2009). This counters the means through which the heritage narratives of this \nsite have been collapsed into a singular notion of Hadrian\u2019s military landscape in the regions heritage \nnarratives. The exhibition narrates the frontier as a lived landscape (with exhibition panels on food, drink, \nclothing, and African building techniques), using archaeological evidence to situate a postcolonial translation \nThe research by archaeologists on life, culture and identity have been privileged (Allason-Jones 2001; 2005; \nHuntley and Stallibrass 1995; Swan and Monaghan 1993; Croom 2007) alongside political critiques of \narchaeology as a colonial discipline itself (Gosden 2004; Hingley 2000) with prejudiced orientations (Isaac \n2004; Martin Bernal, 1987; Orser 2001). The aim here is not a simple erasure of all other established \nnarrations of this landscape, but a tactical re-narration informed by antiquarian and archaeological \nscholarship. \n\u2018Contraries are therefore compatible within the same text under the condition that is narrative.. . .  narrative \npreserves the possibility of a science or a philosophy (it is heuristic); but, as such, it occupies their place and \nhides their absence (de Certeau, 1988,89).  \nPostcolonial Landscape Narratives \nNon-linear narratives are a critical tool for postcolonial theorists who have challenged definitions of \nthemselves and the problematic of using the language of the colonizer, since the 1980s, to re-tell the world, \nthrough their voices, texts and reformulations of narrative (Ashcroft et al 1989; Said, 1990; Loomba,1998; \nGandhi, 1998). Scholars who seek to challenge neat colonial histories, knowledges, taxonomical framings and \nappropriations of cultural and material production, have done so through the challenging of the linear form \nof narrative (Spivak, 1988). This has been both a tool to disrupt a sense of the neatness and singularity of \nlanguage through acknowledging difference and reclaiming the power to narrate histories, cultures and shape \nnew formations within a post-colonial world. For some there is a rupture with pre-colonial self expression, \n12 | P a g e  \n \nand for others there is imposed a gap between the use of \u2018English\u2019 and the pre-colonial language (Ashcroft et \nal, 1989, 10). Postcolonial literatures thus employ strategies to \u2018subvert the imperial cultural formations\u2019 (p11).  \nThe re-presencing of black figures in national history whether through text, artifact or image, is important in \npostcolonial approaches to cultural studies, theory and history-writing. Harris (2009), on considering the \ninstitution of British cultural studies itself argues \u2018that the excision of black and brown Britons as social actors \nis not a matter of blame relating to individuals, but part of a deeply ingrained tradition of considering British \nculture while ignoring the presence of black and brown people\u2019 (Harris, 2009, p485).  \n \nIn the Empire Writes Back (Ashcroft et al, 1989), the authors argue how the oppressive act of being defined as \n\u2018other\u2019 to the \u2018occidental\u2019 and inferior to the colonial subject, was executed using the tool of language and \ntexts. Therefore, the battleground for recovering histories, cultures and subjectivities is the site of the text \nitself; in form and language. \u2018(t) he texts relationship with the historical subject is an active one. It is the text \nwhich transforms the historical subtext which it draws up into itself and this transformation constitutes what \nJameson characterizes as the \u2018symbolic act\u2019 of the narrative. So the text paradoxically, \u2018brings into being that \nvery situation to which it is also, at one and the same time, a reaction\u2019 (Jameson, 1981, 81-2; quoted in \nAshcroft et al, 1989, 172). In the arena of writing race-histories and geographies the value of narrative is \nmanifold. For Toni Morrison writing is \u2018a kind of literary archaeology\u2019 (Morrison, 1990, 302). Morrison\u2019s \nwork has a political ambition. Her project is to counter contemporary values of black history by \nacknowledging the role of scientific racism in editing the historical narratives that had gone before. \u2018David \nHume, Immanuel Kant and Thomas Jefferson, to mention only a few, had documented their conclusions that \nblacks were incapable of intelligence. . . . Hegel in 1813 had said that Africans had no \u2018history\u2019 and couldn\u2019t \nwrite in modern languages (305). Morrison also reflects on how Kant disregarded a perceptive observation by \na black man by saying, \u2018(T)he fellow was quite black from head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was \nstupid\u2019(Kant,1991,113). In archaeological terms, although we cannot recover what foundational evidence of \nblack history, we can re-narrate the absences, occlusions and rupture the uneven accounts of African history, \nsubjectivity and capacities to be valuable within archaeological scholarship and landscape histories.  \n13 | P a g e  \n \n \nChallenges to the embedded and accepted hierarchies of occident and orient have been recently interrogated \nin Shanks and Tilley\u2019s (1987) account of archaeology;  \u2018however poor its data, archaeology provides unique \naccess to the past as \u2018Other\u2019 as a means of holding in tension the universalism of the present\u2019 (cited in \nRowlands and Kristiansen 1998 , p2). Also Gosden (2004; 2006) outlines how British Imperial prejudices \nbased on racial taxonomies have been woven into archaeological scholarship, as a result, he seeks to disrupt \ntheir pervasiveness through a fundamental account of material culture. However in undertaking this non-\ntextual intervention, it must be remembered that the archive is always partial; material cultures have been \ndestroyed and occluded from the museum space and national history as a result of imperial undervaluing of \n\u2018other\u2019 cultures. Material culture has been at the interface of the violences of Imperial narratives and regimes \nof truth.  Absences thus serve to compound historical mythologies and mistruths. \nIn the case of the Roman Wall the aim here is to use the postcolonial reading of landscape and historical \nnarrative to privilege the race-geographies that are materially evidenced at the sites and in the scholarly \naccounts. What is important is the ways in which certain peoples and territories are exiled as \u2018other\u2019 within \nacademic thought, influenced by 19th century notions of taxonomy (R.J.C.Young 2007; Winlow, 2001, 2009; \nAnderson, 2007). This for example, is evidenced namely in the cultural identity proffered to those civilizations \nresident in the African continent. Rowlands and Kristiansen (1998) highlight the disciplinary assumptions that \nshaped figurations of other cultures and the emergence of \u2018Africa\u2019 conceptually, they argue that, \u2018(F)or more \nthan thirty years historians and archaeologists have worked to counteract primitivist ideas about the absence \nof change, cultural backwardness and technical failure of Africa.\u2019 and address the resulting challenge to the \nHegelian view of Africa as not being \u2018an historical continent\u2019 (Rowlands and Kritiansen, 1998, p361). These \nregimes of truth negated, denuded and misrepresented \u2018others\u2019 in archaeological and historical accounts. The \nexhibition addresses the ways in which this over-arching dominant view also conferred a loss of status and \nvisibility to Severus. Birley\u2019s profiling of The African Emperor (2008 [1988]) has not been popularized in \nheritage representations. \n \n14 | P a g e  \n \nIn earlier accounts of Severus\u2019 rule, these occlusions exist. Collingwood-Bruce (1996) argues that repair began \nof the damage done to forts throughout the North and to the Wall, where work was in progress in A.D. 205-\n208. The work was so extensive that Severus came to be described as the actual builder of the Wall,  \n\u2018and the reputation is deserved to this extent, that in many places his engineers did in fact reconstruct it from \nthe very foundations. The punitive campaign was delayed until 208. . . (I)n 209. . .he advanced against the \nCaledonians. The campaigns lasted three seasons, with more success than historians admit... Accounts of \nthese Caledonian wars are written to give an impression of failure, but it seems that their main objective was \nachieved.\u2019 (Collingwood-Bruce, 1996, 5).  \nThe effect of the occluded account of Severus\u2019 role in the national history, and the landscape itself is to \nsmooth a notion of a cultural history of Britain where Romaness folds into an Englishness and a sense of a \nnation built on a particular link to \u2018Europeaness\u2019 in terms of bodies, practices, moral landscape.  \nBruce highlights the ways in which there has been a \u2018smoothing\u2019 of narration to render Septimius as a lesser \nactor in the creation of the Wall as we see it in the 21st century; the physical presence we celebrate as the \nnorthern frontier in representation, narration and encounter is material evidence of Septimius\u2019 determination \nto consolidate the breaches from the barbarians. In Britannia under the Roman Empire, mobility from across \nthe southern and eastern empire occurred and Roman citizenship was a synthesis between cross cultural flows \nand the values of the system of governance (Rowlands and Kristiensen, 1998). The Empire as we know, was \nnot a homogeneous society, in fact scholars have argued that the strength of Romaness and its ability to \nexpand rests with its tolerance of \u2018other\u2019 cultures and its ability to civilize and urbanise these cultures in \nsynthesis. The re-presencing of a black history of Roman Britain through the panels highlighting Septimius \nSeverus, Barates, and Saturninus as well as the mobilities of personnel, technologies and other artefactual \nevidence is at the core of a postcolonial conceptualization of the northern frontier as exhibited in An \nArchaeology of Race. Also recognition of the fact that Hadrian\u2019s Wall is a small section of an international \nborderscape, enables the exhibition to include the Limes Germanicus  (Rhine to the Danube), Limes Tripolitanus \n(South Libya to Tunisia) and Limes Arabicus (running 1 500 km, from Syria to Palestine), all of which are \n15 | P a g e  \n \nprotected by UNESCO as a world limes. This account, disrupts the seemingly \u2018national\u2019 grammars of the Wall \nthrough taking, an inclusive approach to an internationalist account of Roman archaeology and landscape \nresearch. \n<INSERT MAP OF INTERNATIONAL LIMES> \nREPRESENTATION \nTo do justice to both archaeology and postcolonial theory in the curating of the exhibition, it was important \nto think what a postcolonial archaeology of Hadrian\u2019s Wall would look like. Much of the work of postcolonial \ntheorists has been to address the effect of colonial representations and discourses (Said 1990; Bhabha 1994; \nSpivak 1988). Using the narration of an exhibition to counter the shaping of this landscape\u2019s story in a \ncolonial narration was one way in which both the grammars of the dominant narration and the \u2018ordering\u2019 of \nthe museum space itself could be disrupted (Crang, 1994). One of the few accounts of where archaeology \nengages with postcolonial theory is where Gosden (2004) argues that postcolonial theory is absolutely \nrelevant to challenge the \u2018pernicious influence\u2019 (2004, 20) of 19th century colonialism on the discipline. \nAs Crang (1994) has affirmed \u2018the universalism that museums claim masks power relations\u2019 and as such their \nnarratives have often given coherence and meaning to their contents through a discourse of linear and \n\u2018known\u2019 narrative structure. In this sense An Archaeology of Race disrupts on several levels; firstly by offering a \nre-narration through a postcolonial account; secondly the very fact of being an installation by a non-museum \nactor it effectively offers different grammars and discourses which themselves shift the usual technologies of \nknowledge in the museum space; and finally the exhibition espouses an interpretation by adding a \nbiographical narrative of a landscape dominated by African Emperor Septimius Severus and the objects \nemployed in its telling. The narrative structure in this context is not an innocent tool (p39, Crang 1994), but a \nstrategic narrative. In the exhibition the new narrative as owned by the curators and contributors takes up the \npowerful role of making a differentiation between this narrative and others that have gone before in Roman \nstudies. As de Certeau states, this creation of a differentiated narrative \u2018presupposes the rupture that changes a \n16 | P a g e  \n \ntradition into a past object\u2019 (p45). This at once makes narrative empowering for the postcolonial strategy, and \nalso enables the contrariness of this new narration to sit comfortably alongside others.  \nAn Archaeology of Race embraces the complexities of postcolonial narration in practice. The exhibition is not a \nsimple narration of the subaltern story; Severus and his landscape is one where he is a violent Imperialist \noppressor. Any postcolonial reading of this landscape can only make sense in light of British Imperialism and \nits own drive to develop a narrative that underplays him and his rebuilding this lasting material monument \nthat makes legible the frontier landscape today. Situating the subaltern (in this case both a subaltern lens and \nfigure of black history-making and presence in the British landscape), is not enough. Instead of being only \nreliant on the rupture of colonial discourses and produced hierarchies (whether they are based on race, \nculture and\/or material culture) \u2018we must also think about the crucial relations between these hierarchies, \nbetween forces and discourses\u2019 (Loomba, 1998, p200). These fissures between colonial effects and \npostcolonial scholarship remain in the postcolonial oeuvre. However it is important to reflect on how we may \ncontinue to reflect on these foreshadowed tensions that are present in contemporary re-narrations and \ndisruptions. This reflection should not be a debilitating course, instead the legitimacy of institutions \n(museums, galleries, disciplinary scholarship) underpinned by colonial ideologies cannot be taken for granted, \ninstead there must be moves to critique and more importantly strive for a cultural sphere that is colour-blind \nand not determined by colonial regimes of truth, values, discourses and narrations (Rasheed Araeen, 2000, \np18, A new Beginning, Third Text).   \nPostcolonial narration in practice: Severus \nIn Hall\u2019s (1997) account of challenging a regime of representation is to contest these by reversing stereotypes. \nOne aspect of the exhibition An Archaeology of Race is to present a figure that is normally discordant with our \nnotions of rulers, kings, Emperors and colonizers: this account of the frontier landscape places a Black man \ncentre stage in a discourse of Rome, and English landscape, simultaneously. There remains however a \ncontinued problematic of self-determination versus a political imperative; race and historical context are \ncomplex in this narrative of Hadrian\u2019s Wall. For Severus did not consider himself \u2018black\u2019 other or indeed \n17 | P a g e  \n \nmarginal. He like others of his elite society held a deep rooted belief that blackness was linked with death and \nthe underworld (Snowden 1983, 92). Severus himself after successfully defending against incursions in the \nNorth West of Britain, saw an \u2018Ethiopian\u2019 soldier, the presence of a black or Aethiope enraged Severus, it is \nreported that he ordered that the Ethiopian be removed (p179, Snowden, 1970).  \nOne element of the neo-conservative challenge to the premise of the exhibition was posited by both a \nmember of English Heritage and a scholar of the Roman Wall, which was \u2018how do you know he was a \nNegroid?\u2019 There are several layers to this question that expose the complexities of race in Britain today; the \nconservatism of archaeological scholarship on race-categories and of course of the pervasive racism that hides \nbehind calls for legitimacy, evidence, and a lack of recognition of the influence of racism on scholarship itself. \nOne element of this layering is that my use of the word \u2018black\u2019 intended to mean politically \u2018other\u2019 and usually \nmisrepresented in history, was on this occasion translated as \u2018negroid\u2019. This response evidences a lack of \nawareness and engagement with critical race theory, where race is not a biological essential; it is a cultural \ncategorization (Hall 1990; Gilroy 1993; Young 2007). Even in the contemporary era of scientific reemergence \nof biologism (Gilroy, 2000), scientists struggle to separate social and biological determinants (Fullwilley, \n2008). A second layering is the assumption of a colour-blind archaeology; an assumed unrevised account of \nevidence, truth and knowledge, untouched by cultural, or political and social contexts. This account is of \ncourse flawed.  As Moralee\u2019s (2008) and others\u2019 scholarship has highlighted, far from being a singularly \ncolour-blind society, Rome and historical writings on Rome have used racial terms to highlight race \ndifference. When reflecting on Herodian\u2019s Historiae Augustae (Magie,1922), Moralee argues that Emperor \nMaximus Thrax (235-28 CE) is similarly positioned as a perpetrator of the subversion of Senate\u2019s authority by \nbeing a \u2018half-barbarian from the periphery of empire\u2019 (2008,55). Terminology such as \u2018Punic\u2019, \u2018barbarian\u2019 has \nbeen upheld as evidence of the language of differentiation between the Roman ideal and the \u2018other\u2019 savage, \nuncivilized. These referents become indexical with what is counted as Roman; a metonymical index of \nRome\u2019s status itself (Isaac, 2004 and Moralee, 2008, 535). Moralee also gives evidence of Herodian views of \nRoman fears of loss of racial purity in the form of a letter advising against racial contamination, that is \nfabricated by Herodian to lead us to conclude that \u2018only a bad emperor would have considered such \n18 | P a g e  \n \ntransgression\u2019 and that Maximus\u2019s integral cruelty was a result of his consciousness of racial inferiority (p59-\n61; Moralee, 2008): \u2018Just as becoming emperor failed to erase that \u2018barbarian element\u2019 in his father, education \nfailed to erase the racial stain on the son\u2019 (2008,63). The historical context of the various authors\u2019 accounts of \nThrax as barbarian are laid out by Moralee evidencing fears of this profile in the later narratives of 4th, 6th, and \n20th century including being linked to the political thesis in Nazi Germany of racial purity (2008,76). \nIn Birley\u2019s (2008 [1988]) account Severus, is described as \u2018Punic\u2019 often referring to him as being of Phoenician \ndecent, from ancient Carthage. These peoples and their cultures were considered predecessors of modern day \nBerbers, and their language was closely related to Hebrew (Birley, 2008 [1988], 2). Severus\u2019s \u2018hometown \nwhere he spent the first seventeen years of his life, was a very exceptional place, and the \u2018three cities\u2019 \nmarkedly different from the rest of what the Romans call \u2018Africa\u2019. . . . (p1). Tripolitania the region was a \nhybrid between the Mediterranean and the Sahara.  The ethnicity of Severus is of consequence in \ncontemporary times (Spielvogel, 2003; 2006).In contemporary society the idea of an \u2018African\u2019 head of state in \nBritain is seemingly only possible in theory.  However in 193 AD Severus was proclaimed Emperor of Rome \nand its Imperial territories. Severus was born in Lepcis Magna, which is modern day Libya; he died in York in \n211 AD. In 208 AD Severus arrived in Britain, largely to militarily consolidate the difficult frontiers of the \nnorthern territory. Under Severus, \u2018Britannia\u2019 was also split into two: Britannia Superior and Inferior, to \nsecure his power. Incursions from \u2018savage\u2019 lands at the edges of Roman rule were constant; also another now \nWorld Heritage Site, the Antonine Wall, is a modern day remnant of Rome\u2019s early ambitions to conquer the \nknown world. Severus\u2019s military cruelty earned him the nickname \u2018Punic Sulla\u2019, referring to his African origin \nand his vengefulness. Other historical texts reference his \u2018Punic\u2019 roots, \u2018swarthy complexion\u2019 and proclaim \nhim \u2018The African Emperor\u2019.  Throughout history Severus\u2019s identity has been a point of commentary, despite \nmovement from around the Empire not being unusual. Roman rule witnessed several units of soldiery which \noriginated from all over the Roman Empire, including North Africa, Eastern Europe, and the lands \nsurrounding the Mediterranean who were stationed across the Empire. In Britain, these populations lived and \ncontributed to \u2018native\u2019 life on the frontier of Hadrian\u2019s Wall and beyond, leaving material cultures that they \ninspired including coins, African cooking pottery, seeds, fabrics, gravestones, inscriptions and texts.  \n19 | P a g e  \n \nThere are complexities to Severus\u2019s status and situation as is always highlighted when using an ideological \nframe such as a postcolonial lens. Although Severus\u2019s birth and ethnicity give him a special place in modern \nhistory that has had occlusions and exclusions, it remains that he was an elite member of Roman society and a \nperpetrator of Imperial colonization and violence.  In this story however are traces of how ethnicity, \nbirthplace and cultural proximity to a Latin profile was paramount. Despite the seeming \u2018colour-blind\u2019 nature \nof the empire, Severus and others of his society worked hard to become Roman. One early aid to his success \nwas the status of Lepcis itself. In 78 Lepcis had become a municipium a chartered town with the \u2018Latin right\u2019; \nformal recognition of the Latin nature of this \u2018formerly alien community\u2019, civitas pergrina. In particular, the new \nstatus automatically conferred full Roman citizenship on those annually elected as magistrates.\u2019 (Birley \n2008,16). This shift in status followed with people changing their names from Punic to Latin, and the \nrecession in the use of Punic language and inscription (Birley, 2008, 17). At the same time as having political \ncapital and access to Rome, the Septimii had lands near Rome, and Severus himself was \u2018educated with the \nsons of the great\u2019 He completed his education by studying with \u2018the great Quitilian, first holder of an \nimperially endowed chair of rhetoric.\u2019 (Birley, 2008, 18). Throughout his time however the description \u2018Punic\u2019 \nwas a derogatory mode bolstered by the memory of the Hannibalic war. Around 100 AD Lepcis was granted \nthe rank of colonia and all its inhabitants became Roman citizens, conjoined with the cultural citizenship and \ngovernance of Rome. The contextualization of Severus\u2019s identity, in history suffers a \u2018treatment\u2019 based on the \nhistorical context in which he is written about, and the dominant ideologies of that period. In the 21st century, \nit is important to highlight to residents of the frontier in Carlisle, Cumbria, Newcastle and Durham the multi-\nethnic roots and cultures of both Emperor and personnel on the frontier, as contemporary memory-history in \nthe region has little public recognition of it. These issues are outlined in the exhibition panels entitled: \nSeptimius Severus, Roman Citizenship and Severus versus Obama. \nThe positioning of race within Roman scholarship reflects much of the contextual social politics of the day \nwithin which records are made, and thus scholars such as Isaac (2004) are keen to encourage us to situate \nscholarship on difference. Moralee (2008) argues that racial profile of Severus and others shifts in the 6th \ncentury as \u2018barbarians\u2019 become legitimate players in the Western Empire. In 19th century, hybridity in its \n20 | P a g e  \n \ncolonial sense came to be of primary concern in terms of being a threat to humanity and civilization \nthemselves. Using these critiques Moralee states that \u2018No longer is Romanisation seen as a steam roller, \nflattening locals into toga-clad mandarins\u2019, instead of being a racial category, \u2018hybrid\u2019 is the location and site of \ncultural intersections at the edges of where the colonizer flows into new territories. The cultures at the edges \nare thus creative, empowered and productive for the Imperial mission, as they enable a move away from \nnotions of Roman and Barbarian per se.  \nThe frontier as a multicultural landscape \nThe centerpiece of the exhibition, is a lenticular image (a filmed version of the bust at the BM\u2019s front \nentrance, made by Spatial Imaging) of the African Emperor, who like all others before him is pictured in white \nmarble. The discordancy between \u2018white\u2019 marble and African Roman is at play here. The centrality of the bust \nin the room is a statement about the monument of the Wall and landscape as a legacy of his rebuilding it in \nthe form we see it today. Draping each side of Severus are two lengths of bright patterned cloth, 5 meters \nlong and 2 meters in width, each from Syria and Egypt respectively which would normally be found in the \nImperial household (Croom, 2007). The aim here is to disrupt the usual grammars of the Romans as usually \nencountered at the museum; the colours and textures of the fabric, which are hung against a purple Wall \nspace, are intended to draw you into a new narration. An exclusive \u2018English\u2019 sense of heritage landscape is \nunsettled.  \n The role that Hadrian\u2019s Wall played in the securitization of the frontier extended well beyond that of \nBritannia. The northern frontier marked the Roman Empire through Europe, Asia, Arabia and Africa. This \ncommunity of borders connected up societies from the whole Empire. It was a site of mobility and of \nresidence auxiliary soldiers recruited from all over the world. As the map below shows the geographical places \nof \u2018origin\u2019 of soldiery was extensive; thus auxiliary units often took the name of the ethnic community from \nwhich the soldiers were originally recruited. They were usually posted to provinces far from their homes. \nThese included modern day states including: Switzerland, Romania, Macedonia, Germany, Eastern Europe, \n21 | P a g e  \n \nIraq, Syria, Egypt, Syria, Morocco, France, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and many others. In time these \nunits kept their \u2018ethnic\u2019 names but did also later recruit local personnel in Britain (Mann, 1983).   \nIn Thatcher\u2019s 1921, account of his walk along the Roman Wall, it is clear that he imagines the cultural legacy \nof the Roman occupation. Thatcher describes the continual intertwining of the English with an international \ncommunity of soldiery from other countries and on the continual depletion of British natives employed to \nsecure the limes elsewhere.  \n \u2018As vacancies occurred they were supplied by drafts from different countries furnishing men to the \nparticular garrison, while discharged veterans were not sent back to their native country, but were settled and \nprovided for in colonies in Britain of their own countrymen. . . . all the rank and file came from some \nconquered country or other on the continent, none of them were British . . . the Roman policy seems to have \nbeen to recruit the army from the natives of conquered countries, but always to draft them into some legion \nstationed far away from their own country . . . the Wall was garrisoned by men taken from almost every land \nknown to the civilized world except Britain itself\u2019 (Thatcher, 1921, 12) \nMany of the chroniclers traversing the Wall make comparisons between Roman and British Imperial values \nand achievements. The reverend John Skinner (1978 [1801]) is one who questions the humanity of the \nRomans toward their colonies. . . \u2018How curious is the term Barbarians, bestowed on all who were not Roman. \nIn our Indian regiments, we soften the term by calling the officers of our auxiliary, native cavalrymen or \ninfantry\u2019 (1978, 41).  \nA full account of the origins and stationing of soldiery from overseas at the Wall is outlined in the Notitia \nDignitatum; it is the best record of stationed garrison at the Wall prior to 420. This panel below is an original \nproduction for An Archaeology of Race which is based on the Notitia Dignitatum and evidences the presence of \nIraqi\u2019s, Syrians, North Africans and many others that were the first legions of migrants that were populating \nthe frontier. Early evidence has been found of garrisons from all over the Empire stationed at Hadrian\u2019s Wall \nand of their influence and exchanges with local populations (Colingwood-Bruce 1875, xiv). Roman society, in \n22 | P a g e  \n \nBritain can be argued to have been formed from a number of diasporas from across the Empire, whose \npresence translated the nature, landscape and cultural practices in Britain (Eckardt, 2009).  \n>INSERT MOBILITIES PLATE< \nIncluded in the exhibition are several panels, not able to be discussed here, showing the scale of mobilities of \nfoods, fauna and flora, technologies and cultural praxes that are transferred to Britain in the form of an \necological  and cultural portmanteau ( Tolia-Kelly, 2004a; b; c). Roth (2003) has argued that the greatest insight \ninto the transfer of cultural in the vernacular modes of society is to consider identity and power, in the \nmaterial cultures and through these the habitus  of the producer and consumer are made co-present. The \nexhibition itself aims to reflect a notion of bricolage in Roth\u2019s terms, where imbued in the aesthetics, content \nand grammars of the space are made to speak about social geographies and relations in Roman Britain that \nmay have not been made present prior (Roth, 2003,44). However, in any postcolonial account of ethnicities it \nis important not just to focus on food, fabric and cultures. Intellectual and technological exchanges are also \npresent on the frontier landscape and are incorporated in the exhibition. Cooking technologies such as North \nAfrican pottery braziers are found regularly on the Wall. These have been reconstructed in the exhibition \nalongside the pottery equipment of Ancient Britons. It is clear that native potters learned to produce African \ndesigned pottery braziers for the local market, these had built in space for burning wood under the casserole \nwhich sat above. In the same way as contemporary cooking utensils are \u2018nativised\u2019 from \u2018foreign\u2019 sources such \nas Woks and coffee machines, in Roman times these braziers were likely to be absorbed into the local culture \nbut given their fragility, no clear evidence remains.  African vaulting tubes too are found in construction of \nstructures along the Wall, which show the engineering exchanges across the Empire; Africa as a continent was \na source of innovation and design in the 2nd and 3rd century, which in turn shaped this landscape. \nConclusions \nAcademics have a responsibility towards public engagement and dialogue. An Archaeology of Race brings to the \npublic realm a set of artefacts that ground a theoretical perspective on the Roman frontier and link it to both \ncontemporary and historical issues of citizenship, race, imperialism and culture. The aesthetics, grammars and \n23 | P a g e  \n \ntexts embedded in the exhibition are formulations of a postcolonial interpretation of a national heritage \nlandscape. It incorporates a non-nationalistic orientation (Beck and Sznaider, 2006) and a transparent \nknowledge production process of narrative writing (Noxolo, 2009).The archival records and artefacts show \nthat Roman culture was not homogeneous, and that there has been a tendency to present a binary between \nRomans, aiming to civilise an uncomplicated \u2018native\u2019 population. These binaries have tended to skew \nuniversalist interpretations of the past (Fitzjohn, 2007). What An Archaeology of Race has sought to do is to \nenrich material accounts of the relations between \u2018native\u2019 and \u2018Roman\u2019 as well as reconsider the geographies \nof mobilities of peoples, technologies, goods and cultures. A postcolonial interpretation of Hadrian\u2019s Wall \nenables us to see a dynamic, multi-cultured society, and thus challenges a seemingly benign white Imperial \nRomaness; \u2018In the case of York, the Roman population may have had more diverse origins than the city has \nnow \u2018(Eckhardt, 2010). The exhibition rejects a narration of Roman Britain based purely on a Victorian \nsensibility about an Imperial Englishness that aspires to an Augustinian\/Hadrianic Roman picture rather than \na Severan one. Severus is brought forward here to celebrate Black presence. However \u2018Severus\u2019 does not \nstand as benevolent Emperor, but as a violent Imperialist, and is compared to President Obama\u2019s own \npositioning. The exhibition also enables the archaeological and classicist critique of a \u2018colour-blind\u2019 Roman \ncitizenship. Moralee (2008) and Isaac (2004) inform a new location from which to think about the \ninterpretation of the material cultures and Sherwin-Smith (1967) critiques the narrations of historians such as \nStrabo, Pliny and Tacitus who use freely caricatures of \u2018barbarians\u2019; stereotyped in terms of physique, culture \nand capability. These scholars have informed my approach on Roman mobility and identity (Dobson and \nMann1973; Gardner, 2007).  \nThe exhibition has attended to a revitalization of a postcolonial perspective on the archaeological frontier and \nartefactual remains of culture, included are evidences of \u2018syncretism\u2019 in the day-to-day (Webster, 1997). These \nare sites, practices and cultures remain as precipitates of memory, heritage and alternative archaeologies and \nlandscapes of cultural identity and fluid materialities of embodied, spiritual and biological exchanges and \ncreativities in the everyday, public life of Roman Britain.  \n24 | P a g e  \n \n \nIMAGES:  \nPlate One: INSERT PLATE ONE: Get Closer to Rome.
