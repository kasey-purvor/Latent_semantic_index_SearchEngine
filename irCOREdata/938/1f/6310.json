Softback, x + 166 pages,\n\u00a319.99.\nPeter Jarvis is Professor of Continuing\nEducation at the University of Surrey and a\ndistinguished authority in this field. In this work\nhe attempts to analyse what constitutes a 'real\nuniversity' and whether the social changes which\nhave impacted on traditional universities and the\ngrowth of other types of university represent a\ncrisis and\/or a failure to meet societal needs.\nCorporate universities have grown into a major\nbusiness because the traditional university failed\nto meet the demands of corporate business for\neducation and training. He stresses the need for\nuniversities to be true to their own identity in the\nface of such pressure.\nJarvis begins with a review of current pressures\non higher education - changes in knowledge, in\nteaching method and even the role of the\nacademic, the move from an elite to a mass\nsystem and constrained funding. This is followed\nby a review of the process of globalization and\nits impact on the nation state and universities.\nHe moves on to consider how this has affected\nknowledge and influenced the creation of the\nknowledge society and the shift from teaching to\nlearning as a model, including a swift history of\nthe growth of universities and the concept of\nknowledge on the way. Then at the heart of the\nbook is the description and contrast between\ntraditional universities and the growing legion -\nnow numbering over 1,000 - of corporate\nuniversities with budgets totalling over $52\nbillion in 1995. There are interesting reflections\non how universities have themselves moved to\nmore corporate or managerial governance,\nwithout seeing the need for proper training for\ntheir own staff.\nIn his discussion of the meaning of the term\n'university' he proposes a framework which will\nallow a comparison to be made between\ntraditional and corporate universities and indeed\nwithin either group. Although complacency is\nalways a threat, he demonstrates that in the key\nfeatures of accessibility to all groups, breadth of\ncurricula, level of award, research and finally\nservice to the community, traditional universities\noffer a richer set of deliverables than corporate\nuniversities, which do however score more highly,\non the rhetoric of their claims. But traditional\nuniversities no longer enjoy a monopoly of\nsupply and must ensure that their strengths are\nmarketed and sold. It is also the case that\nuniversities may choose to differentiate the areas\nin which they sell their teaching, with some\nconcentrating on the traditional undergraduate\nmarket and others looking at higher degrees or\ndifferent categories of learner.\nThe book claims to be thought-provoking and\nsucceeds in this. It suggests that if not actually in\ncrisis - although it often feels that way -\nuniversities are certainly at a crossroads.\nHowever, the prospect of evolution rather than\nextinction does offer hope. This relatively brief\noverview of the state and position of universities\n67\nReviews\npossesses a clarity and insight which will assist\nthose contemplating which path to follow to\ndefine the route for their own university. There is\nan excellent and substantial bibliography.\nDerek Law\nUniversity of Strathclyde\nIan Forsythe, Teaching and Learning Materials\nand the Internet, 3rd edn, London: Kogan Page,\n2001. ISBN: 0-7494-3367-1. Softback, 166\npages, \u00a319.99.\nThe growing use of the Internet for teaching and\nlearning purposes is spawning a variety of\ninstructional texts on how best to do this. This\nthird edition of Ian Forsythe's book is a case in\npoint. It usefully covers teaching and learning\nissues, especially instructional design, as well as\nthe economics of preparing material on the\nInternet. There is also an A-Z of useful terms\n(which could do with some expanding). Forsythe\nprovides a disclaimer in this regard, stating that\nthe creation of an A-Z for the Internet is diffi-\ncult as it is a changing entity. Forsythe's inten-\ntion is to allow designers of course materials\nusing the Internet 'to focus on the educational\nrequirements of a course and align this with the\noptimal use of the attributes of the technology\nand minimise the limitations imposed by the\ntechnology'.\nAlthough there are approximately sixty texts in\nthe reference section of the book, there are very\nfew refererences to them in the body of the book\nin support of the variety of assertions that\nForsythe makes about teaching, learning and the\nInternet. I would have also liked more in-depth\ndiscussion of the relevant areas.\nThe book is divided into the following chapters:\n1. General considerations for using the Internet\nas a delivery tool; 2. Getting started: the Internet\nand instructional design; 3. From learner focus\nto scenarios and consortia; 4. Getting started; 5.\nSpecific considerations; 6. Cost considerations,\neconomic benefits and budget; 7. Developing\nareas; 8. Learners and the Internet; 9.\nConclusion; 10. An A-Z on the Internet as an\neducational tool; 11. References and appendices.\nFrom the very first the writer announces his\nintent to ensure that technology is used\nappropriately. His concern is 'that hype about\nthe Internet has the potential to disguise its\nlimitations as a tool for teaching and learning'.\nThe term 'paradigm shifts' surfaces in\nabundance in Forsythe's book and may have\n68\ngreater claim than most to its employment here\nas it is a term often applied loosely and\nincorrectly since its use in Thomas Kuhn's\nseminal text, The Structure of Scientific\nRevolution. The paradigm shift explained in this\nbook is the move which technology permits away\nfrom the teacher and on to the learner: 'The new\nparadigm faces teachers with a fundamental\nchallenge to their role and will ultimately cause\nthat role to change.' This chapter emphasizes the\nimportance of needs analyses for courses\ndelivered via the Internet as well as the\nimportance of interaction between learners and\nteachers and the resource implications.\nThe second chapter builds on the earlier\ncomments on the importance of interaction. The\nsomewhat contrived and awkward Five Ts refer\nto 'time', 'technology timid', 'territoriality on\ntopics', 'training', 'truss- and infrastructure\nrequirements'. Forsythe stresses the importance\nof this analysis and planning stage, arguing that\nultimate success or failure is dependent upon it.\nWith regard to territoriality on topics, artificial\nbarriers, he says, are 'not maintainable with the\nnew technologies and the ability to access\nvarious information sources is not controlled by\nthe tyranny of teachers or curricula'. Just\nwhether the Internet signals quite such a promise\nto the promotion of interdisciplinarity remains\nto be seen.\nA concept new to this edition is that of\nscenarios, and they are explained in Chapter 3.\nForsythe feels compelled to explain instructional\nevents as 'tell, show and do' activities. He writes\nthat 'didactic, vicarious and practical genres or\nscenarios are a scheme to make rational the\nprocess of translation from course document to\nteaching and learning activities for the Internet'.\nIn concluding this chapter Forsythe emphasizes\nthe feeling that the Internet will allow\ntechnologically aware educational institutions to\namass a greater number of students than their\nless able counterparts. The danger, he warns, is\nthe growing evidence of the duplication of\ncourse offering and resultant confusion for\nstudents.\nChapter 4 is where the book begins to get to\ngrips with the main issues in the most\naccomplished and coherent way. This chapter\nreiterates in a more detailed way the earlier\nemphasis for interactivity between learner and\nthe teaching and learning materials. Instruc-\ntional attributes, sequencing, assessment\nAlt-] Volume 11 Number I\nmethods and a host of other advice on how best\nto get started are provided. They are all very\nuseful but some need further elaboration. In\ngeneral the book could do with fewer concepts\ntreated with more depth rather than the\nconverse. Nevertheless there is a coherence here\nwhich makes for interesting reading.\nIn this chapter Forsythe emphasizes the need to\nstructure the content on the basis of intended\nlearning outcomes, or objectives, as one means of\ncreating more sophisticated teaching and learning\nmaterials. Attributes such as heading, definition,\nreading, activity or revision are identifiers unique\nto elements of information which contain a single\nconcept. Forsythe believes that 'it is the develop-\nment of a set of attributes that will provide a\nmore meaningful framework for the information\n(or content) of that attribute'.\nChapter 5 deals with the costs and resources\ninvolved in setting up a course. Issues such as\nmaintenance, capital costs, copyright, cabling,\nsystems management, as well as budget con-\nsiderations and the strengths and weaknesses of\nInternet delivery, are discussed. Once again the\nfeeling is that some areas are only touched upon\nrather than dealt with in any comprehensive\nmanner. Forsythe's conclusion in this chapter is\nthat cheap solutions are best avoided.\nChapter 6 is about developing areas, with\ninformation about the current state of play on\nthese issues and their relationship to the\nInternet. Developing areas mainly comprise the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 audio\n\u2022 video\n\u2022 videoconferencing\n\u2022 virtual reality\n\u2022 access and equity issues\n\u2022 information and research tools.\nThe pros and cons of these areas are discussed\nwith concluding pages on the need for organiza-\ntions to change and become more accepting of\nthe new technology. A change that is now more\nprevalent and recognized within the corridors of\neducational institutions.\nThe concluding chapter, 'Learners and the\nInternet', concentrates on the post-compulsory\nschool-age learner and, after a discussion on\nbudget considerations for learners, briefly looks\nat:\n\u2022 small-scale pilots\n\u2022 ability\/skills you will need\n\u2022 your learning environment\n\u2022 learning and learning styles\n\u2022 your progress.\nAll too often, however, the reader is little more\nthan alerted to the complexity of some of these\nheadings.\nOverall, as an introduction, Teaching and\nLearning and the Internet is a useful text written,\nin the main, in a readable way.\nChris Foggin\nUniversity of the West of England\nA. Inglis, P. Ling and V. Joosten, Delivering\nDigitally: Managing the Transition to the\nKnowledge Media, 2nd edn, London: Kogan Page,\n2002. ISBN: 0-7494-3471-6. Softback, xiv + 272\npages, \u00a319.99.\nThe first edition of Delivering Digitally was\nreviewed in detail in Alt-J 8 (2). The concluding\nsentence from that review still seems to provide a\nfair summary of this book. 'Delivering Digitally\nprovides an insightful overview of the\nmanagerial issues involved in meeting the\nchallenges of the digital age; and, still more\nimportantly, it provides a range of practical\ninstruments to support managers engaged in\nmeeting those challenges.'\nIt is indeed a text aimed at managers in educa-\ntion rather than at classroom practitioners. It is\nabout planning for change and then managing\nthat change effectively, considering the issues\nand individuals likely to be involved at each\nstage. But at the same time it is a book of great\npracticality, it is pragmatic in tone, and the\nreader is never in any doubt that the authors\nhave substantial experience of working through\nexactly the types of situations that they discuss.\nAlthough it is claimed to have been substantially\nrewritten it retains the common-sense practical-\nity that characterized the first edition, the overall\nstructure of the text is retained and the chapter\nheadings remain essentially unchanged.\nDelivering Digitally is split into four sections,\n'Context', 'Implementation', 'Quality improve-\nment' and 'The future', although the 'Imple-\nmentation' section is by far the most substantive\nsection including eight of the book's thirteen\nchapters. Most of the chapters are self-contained\n69\nReviews\nand so there is no need to follow the text in a\nlinear fashion from cover to cover. The examples\nand illustrations used throughout the text tend\nto relate more to distance education than to a\ncampus-based model, but the contrasts between\nthe British, American and Australian ap-\nproaches are effectively presented.\nThe first chapter presents a history of the Web\nand computer-supported learning updated to\ninclude newer technologies such as DVD, and\nexplores the rate of change of technologies. It is in\nChapter 2, 'Forces driving educational change',\nthat the approach of this particular book starts to\nbecome evident. Other books describe change in\neducational systems and developing theories\nabout the nature of learning. But here the whole\ndrive for change is contextualized into broader\nsocial and economic trends and these are directly\nrelated to implications for policy-makers. The\ntables relating premises to policy implications are\nthought-provoking.\nThe heart of the book is the 'Implementation'\nsection. It starts with a comparison of the real\ncosts for resource-based and traditional-learning\nmodels, the different types of cost and the\ndifferent people involved. 'A cost or an invest-\nment?' highlights hidden costs, including the\nprotection of intellectual property rights, and\nstresses that sometimes significant investment is\nnecessary if the change proposed is to have any\nreal likelihood of success. The authors then\nmove on to explore a number of 'integrated\nelectronic learning environments' and stress the\nneed to select a VLE which matches with both\nthe teaching model and the technical\ninfrastructure of your institution. Supporting\nstaff through the change process is discussed,\nalthough this is focused on developing and\nreviewing courses and course materials and does\nnot explore staff motivation or willingness to\nembrace the changes in the first place. The next\nchapter compares the characteristics of stand-\nalone learning packages with courses which rely\non learning conversations via CMC tools. The\nneed for provision of appropriate support\nservices is stressed and the changes in libraries as\nonline journals and resources become more\nfamiliar. Chapter 10 presents a brief overview of\nthe main issues and questions to be considered in\nan evaluation. The final chapter in this section\nlooks at preparing for change, presenting it in\nthree phases - the planning, the start-up and the\nchangeover, and again stresses the need for\nappropriate evaluation to be embedded into all\nstages of this process.\n70\nThe third section consists of a single chapter\nwhich explores the characteristics of good\nlearning and teaching institutions. It presents a\nframework for quality improvement and useful\nlistings of indicators of good practice and\nprinciples of good practice.\nThe final section, again just a single chapter,\nlooks at technologies and their rates of develop-\nment. It describes ASDL and streaming and\nargues that the future lies in metadata and\ninteroperabilty standards. Along with the\nopening chapter it will inevitably suffer from a\ntendency to date quickly.\nA new addition since the first edition is a group\nof eight case studies drawn from practice in\nNorth America and Canada, which provide\ninteresting descriptive examples of successes and\nalso failed innovations. Some are familiar, some\nare new, but they strengthen a book which is\nalready strong on relating propositions to\npractice by providing further contextual\nexamples, along with further references.\nAt the end of the book, another new addition is\na list of Web links and online resources. It is\npresented as an annotated list, grouped under\nheadings such as intellectual property, online\njournals, information on standards; the authors\nare careful to make no claims as to either its\ncurrency or its completeness. As in the previous\nedition there are also a number of useful\nresources embedded into the relevant chapters\nsuch as checklists and audit tools.\nOverall, Delivering Digitally is easy to read and\nvery digestible. Information is presented in a\nvariety of styles, making frequent use of bulleted\nlists, tables and diagrams as well as plain text.\nReading it I found myself thinking that many of\nthe observations were neither new nor radical, but\nmore an embodiment of common sense, pre-\nsented in a manner that makes it easy to identify\nthe main points. This book will become as well\nthumbed as my copy of the first edition, which\nseems, incidentally, to have been 'adopted' by a\ncolleague.. Now that has to be a recommendation.\nNora Mogey,\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nLiz Brant and Tony Harvey, Choosing and Using\nMusic in Training, Aldershot: Gower, 2001.\nISBN: 0-566-08426-0. Hardback + CD-ROM,\nvi + 58 pages, \u00a339.99.\nThis pocket-size book is simple and easy to read.\nAlt-J Volume 11 Number I\nDivided into fourteen sections, it provides a\nquick guide to readers who are new to\nincorporating music into their face-to-face\ntraining. The accompanying CD contains\nseventy-five minutes of well-performed, good\nmusic.\nIn the Introduction (Section 1), the authors have\ntried to make the readers think about using\nmusic in different scenarios. The authors then\nenumerate several popular examples and\ntheories (Sections 2 and 3) to illustrate that\nmusic is known for enhancing learning. Next,\nthe four different brain waves - alpha, beta,\ntheta and delta - are introduced. According to\nthe authors and the examples they quoted,\n'brain-waves determine how effective we are at\ndoing a particular task and brain waves can be\naltered by music'.\nIn Sections 4 and 5, the authors remind the\nreaders that music could affect our positive and\nnegative emotions, and describe how our bodies\nreact to various types of music. In Section 6,\nseveral genres of music are suggested to\nincorporate in training, such as baroque, jazz\nand blues. The authors do not go into detail in\nexplaining why a certain kind of music would\nhave a certain reaction on an audience, nor in\nidentifying the elements in the music that would\ninduce alpha, beta, theta and delta brain-waves.\nThe authors' advice in choosing the appropriate\nkind of music for training is 'trust your own\nintuition'.\nIn Section 7, the authors address some factors\nthat can influence the final effect of music, such\nas speed, volume, instrumentation and the\nlisteners' familiarity with the piece of music. In\nSection 8, the authors enumerate a variety of\npurposes for using music in training, such as to\ncreate a welcoming atmosphere, to stimulate\ncreativity and to encourage reflection. The\ncharacteristics of the music and their associated\nbrain-wave types were also discussed. In Section\n9, the authors remind us not to forget the impact\nthat silence can make.\nSection 10 provides some tips on making correct\nuse of the audio equipment. For example, it is\nbetter to use a CD\/cassette-player with a high\npower output (not volume) to ensure that music\ncan fill a room without any distortion. In\nSection 11, the authors discuss legality and\nlicensing issues. For instance, when copyrighted\nmusic is used for training in public premises, at\nleast one party should have the licence to play\nmusic legally - either the premises occupier, the\nindependent trainer or the training provider.\nThis section focuses on the copyright act and the\nlicensing organizations in the UK.\nSection 12 contains frequently asked questions.\nIt contains ten thoughtful questions and ten\nwell-explained answers. For example, 'How\nshould I deal with participants' requests for\nparticular music, especially when it is\nunsuitable?', 'Are there some people who do not\nbenefit from music being played?'\nSection 13 is the conclusion and it is also a\nrecapitulation of the previous twelve sections.\nThe play-list of the CD is tabulated in section 14.\nHere the authors provide the titles, origin and\ncomposer's name for the music listed. The\nduration of each track is clearly labelled, and\neach track is categorized according to the\nintended types of atmosphere to be created, such\nas 'welcoming', 'energizing' and 'departing'.\nThe authors have included many interesting\ntopics. However, each topic is discussed only\nbriefly and without much elaboration. For\nreaders who have previously read about the\nbenefits of using music to enhance learning, it\nwould be more useful for them to check out the\nfurther reading list in the bibliography in order\nto acquire a better understanding of incorporat-\ning music in training. For readers who are\nexperimenting with this technique for the first\ntime, this book may just serve as a sweet taster.\nChoosing and Using Music in Training would be\nfurther improved if the authors could provide\nmore detailed referencing. For example, the\nauthors say: 'Research shows that responses to\nmusic are fairly universal.' However, they do not\nprovide any additional information regarding\nthe research, such as when and where the\nresearch was conducted and by whom. I also feel\nthat the authors could incorporate more of their\nfirst-hand sources about the benefits of using\nmusic in training, as they are both experienced\ntrainers in the field. Last but not least, this book\nwould be more complete if the unknown\nmusicians who performed on the twenty tracks\nand their record labels could be acknowledged.\nLouisa Yong\nUniversity of Manchester\n71\n"}
