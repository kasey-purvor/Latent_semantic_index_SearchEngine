The viral \ncommunity in coastal Norwegian waters was separated according to genome size using pulse \nfield gel electrophoresis.  Viral populations within a wide genome size range (31 to 380 kb) \nwere investigated for the presence of the psbA and psbD genes using PCR, combined with \ncloning and sequencing. The results show the presence of photosynthetic genes in viral \npopulations from all size ranges.  Thus we are able to obtain valuable information about the \nsize class to which viral particles that encode photosynthesis genes belong.  The wide \ngenomic size range detected implies that we have observed a different cyanophage profile \nthan has previously been reported. Thus, the method of phage gene detection applied here \nmay represent a truer picture of phage diversity in general or that there is a larger range of \nsize profile for viruses with psbA and psbD in higher latitudes than for the better studied \nlower latitudes.  Alternatively we may be observing a picture of diversity based on a different \nset of biases than that from either isolation-based research, or from conventional \nmetagenomic approaches.   \n \n 2\n1. Introduction 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n \nThe main prokaryotic component of the picophytoplankton in the photic zone of the world\u00b4s \noceans consist of marine unicellular cyanobacteria from the genera Synechococcus and \nProchlorococcus. Together they contribute to up to 89 % of the primary production in the \noligotrophic regions of the oceans (Li, 1995, Liu, et al., 1997, Partensky, et al., 1999). \nCyanophages are viruses that infect cyanobacteria and are, like their hosts, ubiquitous in \nmarine environments. They are found in concentrations up to 106 particles\/ml in coastal \nwaters during the summer period and are considered a significant factor in determining the \ndynamics of cyanobacterial populations (Suttle & Chan, 1993, Waterbury & Valois, 1993, \nSuttle & Chan, 1994).   \nGenes involved in photosynthesis have recently been detected in cyanophages (Mann, \n2003). These genes (psbA and psbD) codes for two proteins, D1 and D2, that form the \nreaction centre dimer of photosystem II (PSII).  DI is common to all oxygenic phototrophs \nand has a high turnover rate as a result of photo-damage (Aro, et al., 1993) .  Both psbA and \npsbD genes have been reported in cyanophages infecting Synechococcus  (Mann, 2003, \nMillard, et al., 2004, Mann, et al., 2005, Sullivan, et al., 2006),  Prochlorococcus (Lindell, et \nal., 2005, Sullivan, et al., 2005, Sullivan, et al., 2006)  and identified in BAC clones and \namplicons from environmental samples (Zeidner, et al., 2005).  Studies have shown that these \nphage-encoded photosynthetic genes are expressed in the host after infection (Lindell, et al., \n2005, Clokie, et al., 2006a). The expression of these genes may increase the fitness of the \nphage by ensuring the provision of energy for extended viral replication.  \nProchlorococcus is essentially ubiquitous between 40oN and 40oS, but is not found in \nwater where the temperature is less than 10oC (Olson, et al., 1990). This contrasts to \nSynechococcus, which is somewhat broader distributed in that it tolerates a wider range of \ntemperature. Prochlorococcus is normally about 10-fold more abundant than Synechococcus \nin the oligotrophic regions of the open oceans (Vaulot, et al., 1995), while Synechococcus \npopulations are most abundant both in coastal and colder waters (Reviewed in Partensky, et \nal., 1999). Most Synechococcus phage research has been carried out in low-latitude temperate \nand tropical waters and there is a lack of knowledge about the diversity of these phages in \nwaters of latitudes above 60o.  \nThe fact that most viral hosts have not been cultured has severely limited studies of viral \ndiversity. One characteristic of viruses, which varies over a wide range and is readily \n 3\ndetermined, is the genome size. Reported viral genomes range from a few to 1200 kb (Raoult, \net al., 2004, Cann, 2005). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is a method that provides a \nseparation over the full range of intact viral genome sizes. Lately, this approach has been used \nin several studies to explore the dynamics in the communities of dsDNA viruses in the marine \nenvironment (Wommack, et al., 1999, Steward, et al., 2000, Castberg, et al., 2001, Larsen, et \nal., 2001, Riemann & Middelboe, 2002, Jiang, et al., 2003, Ovreas, et al., 2003, Larsen, et al., \n2004, Sandaa & Larsen, 2006). These studies have shown that the viral assemblage in the \nmarine environment is distributed in a genome size range from approximately 20 to 560 kb. \nThe most dominant populations have genome sizes between 20 and 100 kb (Wommack, et al., \n1999, Steward, et al., 2000, Ovreas, et al., 2003, Larsen, et al., 2004, Sandaa & Larsen, \n2006), which is also the size range of most isolated marine bacteriophages with dsDNA \ngenomes (Ackermann & DuBow, 1987, Jiang, et al., 2003). Infections by cyanophages were \nfirst reported in 1990 (Proctor & Fuhrman, 1990, Suttle, et al., 1990)  and isolates of these \ncyanoviruses have recently been characterised and sequenced (Suttle & Chan, 1993, \nWaterbury & Valois, 1993, Wilson, et al., 1993, Chen & Lu, 2002, Mann, et al., 2005). Most \nof the Synechococcus phages are tailed phages with dsDNA genomes mostly with genomes in \nthe range 100-200 kb belonging to the family Myoviridae (Mann, 2003).   \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \nThe objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of photosynthetic genes in \nuncultured cyanophages from Norwegian costal waters.  All previous studies of \nphotosynthetic viral genes have been either on isolated viruses (Lindell, et al., 2004, Millard, \net al., 2004, Lindell, et al., 2005, Sullivan, et al., 2005, Sullivan, et al., 2006) or using whole \nviral fractions (Zeidner, et al., 2005, Sullivan, et al., 2006). The approach described here is \nunique as it allows us to investigate the presence of photosynthesis genes in non-cultured \nviruses, but where the genome size of the virus is known.  This type of information can not be \nobtained from standard metagenomic data sets.  To do this, viral PFGE bands within a wide \ngenomic size range were investigated for the presence of the photosynthetic genes, psbA and \npsbD. PCR products with amplicons of these two genes were cloned, sequenced, and \nphylogenetic analyses were performed.  \n \n 4\n2.

Sample collection \nCoastal water samples were collected at a station in Raunefjorden (60\u00b016.2\u2019N, 5\u00b012.5\u2019E), \nsouth of Bergen, Norway at nine different time points between 13th of April, to 2nd of \nNovember 2004 (Table 2). A total volume of 30 l was collected from the 2-meter depth. The \nsamples were collected using a hand pump connected to a flask. Temperature was measured \nusing a STD SAIV a\/s SD 204 with a Sea Point fluorometer (SAIV A\/S, Environmental \nSensors & Systems, Bergen, Norway).  \n \n2.2. Concentration of viral communities. \n \nNatural viral communities were concentrated from 25 l of seawater by ultrafiltration. The \nsamples were filtrated through a 0.45 \u00b5m pore-size low-protein-binding Durapore membrane \nfilters of 142 mm in diameter (Millipore) to remove zooplankton, phytoplankton and some \nbacteria. The filtered samples were then concentrated down to a final volume of around 150 to \n250 ml, using a 30 000 MW cuttoff spiral-wound Millipore ultrafiltration cartidge \n(Regenerated Cellulose, PLTK Prep\/scale TFF 1 ft2, Millipore). One hundred and forty ml of \nthis concentrate was concentrated further by ultracentifugation (Beckman L8-M with SW-28 \nrotor, Beckman GmbH, Germany) for 2 h at 25 000 rpm at 10 oC. The viral pellet was \ndissolved in 400 \u00b5l of SM buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4.7H2O, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH \n8.0), 0.005% (w\/v) glycerine). 200 \u00b5l was stored at \u201320\u00baC for quantitative Real-Time PCR \nanalysis, while 200 \u00b5l was used for PFGE analysis \n \n2.3. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) \n \nFour virioplankton agarose plugs were made from the 200 \u00b5l concentrate. The samples were \nseparated on a 1%w\/v SeaKem GTG agarose (FMC, Rockland, Maine) gel in 1 X TBE gel \nbuffer using a Bio-Rad DR-II CHEF Cell (Bio-Rad, Richmond Ca, USA) electrophoresis unit \n(Wommack, et al., 1999). From each sample point three of the plugs were used, each at a \ndifferent pulse ramp condition in order to separate the large range of viral genome sizes: i): 1-\n5 s switch time with 20 h run time for separation of small genome sizes (0-130 kb); ii) 8-30 s \nswitch time with 20 h run time for separation of medium genome sizes (130-300 kb); iii) 20-\n40 s switch time with 22 h run time for separation of large genome sizes (300-600 kb). A \n 5\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \nmolecular size standard (lambda ladder and 5 kb ladder (Bio-Rad, Richmond, California)) \nwas run on each side of the gel.  Further details of the procedure are found in (Larsen, et al., \n2001). The gels were visualized and saved as computer files using the Fujifilm imaging \nsystem, LAS-3000.  \n  \n2.4. PCRs, cloning and DNA sequencing.   \n \nPFGE bands to be investigated for the presence of photosynthetic genes were excised from \nthe gel and frozen at \u201320Co. The DNA was extracted from the gel by use of the GeneClean \nTurbo kit (BIO101) for extraction of large DNA fragments from agarose gel, following the \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions yielding approximately 10 ng\/\u00b5l of DNA (total 30 \u00b5l). The \ngenomic DNA required for sequencing and PCR were produced by the GenomiPhi DNA \namplification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions \nyielding approximately 1\u00b5g\/\u00b5l of DNA. This DNA was used in a PCR with both the primer \nsets targeting a section of the photosynthetic genes psbA and psbD (Table 1).  PCRs were \ncarried out in a total volume of 50 \u00b5l containing: sterile distilled water, PCR buffer (10 x PCR \nbuffer B, Promega, Madison, WI), dNTPs (each 200 nM), primers (each 0.5 \u03bcM), 1.5 mM \nMgCl, 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and template amplicon (1-2 ng). Amplification \nconditions using the psbA primers were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 10 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 \nsec, 64\u00b0C (-1\u00b0C per cycle) for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. There was then an extension of 2 \nmin at 72\u00b0C, followed by 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 56.5\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. \nThe final extension was at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Furthermore, the amplification conditions for the \npsbD primers were: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 \nmin, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min.  The PCR products were cloned with the TOPO \nPCR cloning kit (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) following the manufacturer\u2019s description. The \nresulting reactions were used to transform competent Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen). \nFifteen positive clones (white colonies) from each library were picked randomly and \ntransferred by streaking onto agar plates. Positive clones were confirmed by PCR using the \nM13 primers according to the protocol (Invitrogen). Positive PCR products were purified \nusing the DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (Genetix Limited, New Milton, UK).  Five \npositive PCR products from each cloning reaction were sequenced by cycle sequencing \naccording to the protocol from Perkin Elmer (Foster City, USA) using the cloning  primer \nM13f (Invitrogen) as sequencing primer.  Sequences were obtained on the ABI PRISM 3700 \nsequence analyser (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem, USA).  \n 6\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n \n2.5. Phylogenetic analysis. \nBetween two and five clones resulted in sequences of good quality and were used in the \nphylogenetic analysis. Analysis of DNA sequences was carried out by alignment to the closest \nrelative in the GenBank database using BLASTX (Altschul, et al., 1990).  Alignments were \nperformed using CLUSTALX (Thompson, et al., 1997). Sequences were initially aligned \nbased on protein sequences.  The protein alignment was then used to align the corresponding \nDNA sequences. Maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis were conducted on \nnucleotide dataset by using the test version of  PAUP* 4.0 beta10 (Swofford, 2000). Supports \nfor clades was estimated by means of bootstrap analysis, as implemented in PAUP* using \n1000 replicates.

Results and Discussion. 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \nHere we report the first study to investigate the diversity of uncultured environmental \nviruses harbouring photosynthetic genes (psbA and psbD) in samples from cold sea water.  \nThe study was performed by investigating nineteen PFGE bands in a broad size range (31-380 \nkb) from samples taken at different time periods (Fig. 1) based on information on the viral \ndiversity and cyanophage seasonal dynamics in Raunefjorden (Sandaa & Larsen, 2006). The \nbands which were chosen represented the brightest bands in each of the different size classes. \nThe viral community in Raunefjorden have shown a pronounced seasonal dynamic that \ncorrelates with changes in the abundance of possible hosts (Sandaa & Larsen, 2006). Most of \nthe bands examined in the present study were from samples collected between late September \nand early November. This is at the same time there is a bloom in the Synechococcus \npopulation in the fjord (Sandaa & Larsen, 2006). The bloom is followed by a peak in the \ncyanophage numbers, and is accompanied by a major change in the viral community structure \n(Sandaa & Larsen, 2006). The water temperature in Raunefjorden, at the sampling times was \nbetween 5,3 and 13,3\u00b0C (Table 2). Over a 10 months period, the water temperature at the \nsampling depth in Raunefjorden may vary between 5,2 to 15,4\u00b0C (Sandaa & Larsen, 2006). \nAs Prochlorococcus has not been reported in water with temperatures below 10\u00b0C (Olson, et \nal., 1990) it is reasonable to conclude that the putative uncultured cyanophages presented in \nthis study infect Synechococcus strains.  \nEleven out of 19 investigated PFGE bands in this study contained detectable \nphotosynthetic genes. The genes were detected in PFGE bands with genomic sizes from 31 to \n380 kb (Table 2). Although the size range of genomes containing psbA and psbD is larger \nthan has been described before, it may be even larger than we report, as bands smaller or \nlarger than this size range were not investigated. Eight of the PFGE bands contained both the \npsbA and psbD genes, while three of the PFGE bands had only one of the genes (Table 2). \nThe psbA and psbD genes are highly conserved (Lindell, et al., 2004, Millard, et al., 2004, \nSullivan, et al., 2006), suggesting that they encode functional proteins that may be involved in \nmaintaining host photosynthesis during infections (Clokie, et al., 2006a).  Most cultured \ncyanophages carry both the psbA and psbD genes (Lindell, et al., 2004, Millard, et al., 2004, \nSullivan, et al., 2006), however, some only contain psbA (Millard, et al., 2004, Sullivan, et \nal., 2006). Two of the PFGE bands in this study contained only the  psbA gene. However, in \ncontrast to earlier published findings, we amplified only the psbD gene from one of the PFGE \nbands (Table 2).  This is the first observation of cyanophages carrying the psbD gene, only. \nThese observations, along with the fact that psbD and psbA are very far apart from each other \n 8\nin Synechococcus genomes, implies that the genes have been acquired independently from \ntheir hosts. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n Our present knowledge on the occurrence and diversity of the photosynthetic genes in \ncyanophages is mainly based on isolated phages, belonging to two viral families, Myoviridae \nand Podoviridae (Mann, 2003, Lindell, et al., 2004, Millard, et al., 2004, Sullivan, et al., \n2005, Sullivan, et al., 2006) and from their abundance in metagenomic data sets (Zeidner, et \nal., 2005, Sullivan, et al., 2006).  Metagenomic data sets have been very valuable in raising \nour awareness of the widespread nature of phage encoded photosynthesis genes but do not \nprovide further information about the phage biology.  Although whole and partial genome \nsequencing of cultured cyanophages has revealed psbA and psbD genes in Synechococcus \nmyoviruses, none have been shown to be in any Synechococcus podoviruses (Sullivan, et al., \n2006), however it should be noted that very few Podoviridae infecting Synechococcus have \nbeen isolated or sequenced. The genome size in cultured cyanophages varies from \napproximately 48-200 kb and the trend is for myoviral genomes (normally in the size range \n100-200 kb) to be larger than podoviral genomes which normally range from 38-48 kb \n(Wichels, et al., 1998, Mann, 2003). Forty-five percent of the observed PFGE bands with \nphotosynthetic genes, had genome sizes in this range (95-200 kb), however, 55 % fell outside \nthis normal size range. Three of the populations (S9, S12 and S13) were in the genomic size \nrange 31 to 67 kb, which according to size suggests they might belong to the Podo- or \nSiphoviridae.  So far, there is no report of Synechococcus phages from Siphoviridae, and only \nfew isolates reported belonging to Podoviridae (Waterbury & Valois, 1993, Fuller, et al., \n1998, Chen & Lu, 2002, Sullivan, et al., 2005, Sullivan, et al., 2006).  On the other hand, if \nthese viral populations belong to Myoviridae, this is also interesting as it suggests that the size \nrange of this taxonomic group must be much broader that earlier reported. The other viral \npopulations (3b, 5b, and S1) were in the genomic size range of 240 to 380 kb. Although it is \nmost likely that these are from Myoviridae, they are much bigger than any reported thus far.  \nAnother plausible explanation is that these photosynthetic genes are from viral populations \ninfecting photosynthetic picoeukariotes, as viruses infecting algae do have genome sizes in \nthis size range (Sandaa, et al., 2001, Castberg, et al., 2002,Van Etten & Meints, 1999). These \npsbA and D genes, however, exhibited highest similarity to other cyanophage and \nSynechococcus sequences in GenBank, not to photosynthetic genes in picoeukariotes. We \ntherefore believe that these genes are present in cyanophages infecting Synechococcus.  It \nshould though be stressed that these observations are based on genome size alone, and that \n 9\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \nphysiological properties of the phage, e.g. viral morphology, is essential for correct definition \nof phage taxonomy. \n Phylogenetic analysis of the psbA and psbD was carried out in PAUP* using both \nmaximum parsimony and a neighbour-joining analysis (NJ).  The two methods gave \ncongruent results and those presented here are from the NJ analysis (Fig 2a and b). Most of \nthe clusters of the environmental sequences from this study lack sequences from cultured \ncyanophage or hosts, which suggests that these sequences may belong to phages that infects \nas-yet uncultured Synechococcus hosts.  This is a common observation when using culture- \nindependent approaches for investigation of environmental viruses.  The psbA sequences fell \ninto several distinct groups.  From the top of the tree and downwards, one clade of 7 psbA \nsequences  has 87% bootstrap support and consists only of environmental sequences \ndetermined in this study.  There is then an interesting group (with 76% bootstrap support) \nwhich contains both a new psbA sequences from this study, an environmental clone from the \nMonterey Bay, California (Zeidner, et al., 2003) and a known Synechococcus myophage S-\nRSM2.  Two smaller clades again contain 2 and 3 new environmental psbA sequences, \nrespectively.  The two Synechococcus strains included in this analysis form a clade with an \nenvironmental psbA sequence from the Monterey Bay, California (Zeidner, et al., 2003).  \nThere is one final large group which contains the remainder of the environmental psbA \nsequenced from Raunefjorden and which at its higher level contains 2 environmental \nsequences, one from the Red Sea (BAC9D04) and the other from the Mediterranean Sea \n(V141) (Zeidner, et al., 2005).  The sequence BAC9DO4 is from a putative podophage based \non the fact that genes upstream of it are podophage like (Zeidner & B\u00e9j\u00e0, 2004), but the phage \nhas not been isolated so the actual morphology has not been confirmed. Thirty eight percent \nof the psbA sequences from this study clustered in this large clade. If these viral populations \nare podophages, infecting Synechococcus, this is in contrasts to what has been shown using \ndifferent methods in other environments. Therefore it may be that the method of phage gene \ndetection employed here may represent a truer picture of phage diversity in general, or that \nphage diversity in high latitudes has a different profile to that from better studied lower \nlatitudes.  It may alternatively be that the method used in this study simply has a different set \nof biases than isolation-based or strict metagenomic approaches. Although the phage psbA \nsequences isolated here cluster with the sequence in BAC9D4, it should be emphasised that \nthere is significant variation at the nucleotide level, as there were a sequence differences of \napproximately 25 %.  \n 10\n The environmental psbD sequences obtained in this study fell into several distinct \ngroups (Fig 2b), showing greatest similarity to three Synechococcus myophages, syn1, syn10 \nand S-RSM2 (Millard, et al., 2004, Sullivan, et al., 2006).  It is worth mentioning that the \npsbD gene has only been detected in cyanophage isolates belonging to Myoviridae (Sullivan, \net al., 2006).  The isolate, S-RSM2 was isolated from the Gulf of Aquaba (Millard, et al., \n2004). PsbD appears to be a much better phylogenetic marker than psbA as all of these new \npsbD sequences were distinguishable from their host psbD genes, in contrast to the phage-\nencoded psbA genes that form a clade together with their host genes (Fig 2a and b). Thus, \ncompared to the phage encoded psbA genes, these new psbD genes might have had a longer \npurifying selection time resulting in a clear divergence of the viral and host psbD genes.  It \nmay alternatively be the case that there is less evolutionary constraint on psbD than psbA \ngenes and thus the phage-encoded versions can evolve more freely than phage-encoded psbA. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n Interestingly, the psbD genes from the different clones partly cluster according to their \noriginal PFGE band.  In contrast, the psbA genes did not show any such relationship.  Thus, it \nseems that the level of diversity observed in the psbD gene is less than that observed in psbA \nwhere multiple very closely related genes were recovered from a single band. This might \nimply that the genes are moving or evolving (or both) independently, with different selection \npressures that also would result in phylogenetic differences.  Indeed, it may be that a specific \nphage \u2018population\u2019 may have multiple versions of psbA.  Alternatively, differences between \nthe trees may also be attributed to the fact that each PFGE band may consist of more than one \nviral population, with a similar genome sizes and so the clone library of one viral band can \nthus contain photosynthetic genes from different, but genetically similar cyanophages. \nAlthough, some of the photosynthetic genes in this study might originate from host genes, the \nfact that all the psbD sequences from Raunefjorden displayed greatest similarity to isolated \ncyanophages, and not to their hosts, is inconsistent with this assumption, confirming the \nreliability of both the viral concentration step and the PFGE analysis. In summary the psbD \nanalysis shows a clear diversity of phage encoded photosynthetic gene, whilst the psbA \nanalysis appears to suffer from homoplasy, despite this, it is still useful as it has hinted at the \nfamily affiliation to which 8 of the newly sequenced phage populations may belong. \n Using PFGE for studies of the viral community, it is possible to detect between 105 -\n106 viral particles per ml (Wommack, et al., 1999, Steward, 2001). One important issue is the \nsize of the viral genome that will influence the sensitivity of the method. For viruses with \nlarger genome sizes, the detection limit will be lower, e.g. a viral genome of 300 kb might be \ndetected down to 105 particles per ml (Steward, 2001). In our analysis we collected 25 l of \n 11\nsample that was concentrated by a factor of approximately 100.  If we assume a detection \nlimit of 10\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n5, we need to have 103 particles per ml of one population to result in a signal on the \nPFGE gel.  \nIn order to produce sufficient DNA from the different PFGE bands, we applied a \ntechnique based on whole genome amplification, using the enzyme \u03c6 29 DNA polymerase. \nThe \u03c6 29 DNA polymerase is an enzyme which is widely used for rolling-circle amplification \nof plasmids and circular DNA templates (Dean, et al., 2002, Detter, et al., 2002). The strand-\ndisplacing enzyme has proofreading activity, is extremely sensitive, and has been shown to \namplify DNA of up to 70 kb (Blanco, et al., 1989). This polymerase has also been used for \nenvironmental whole-genome amplification of bacterial and viral communities(Abulencia, et \nal., 2006, Angly, 2006) and for a variety of genetical applications including sequencing and \nmicrosatellite marker and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of single \nindividuals (Jiang, et al., 2005). These results have demonstrated that the introduction of bias \nmay be due to the sizes of DNA templates (possibly sheared during extraction and mixing), \nrandom primer availability, and stochastic effects of amplifying from very low concentrations \nof template (Jiang, et al., 2005, Abulencia, et al., 2006). Another bias may be the differential \ncloning efficiency of amplified DNA compared to un-amplified DNA (Abulencia, et al., \n2006). Most of these biases will not be valid in our study as we used the multiple \ndisplacement amplification (MDA) approach to produce DNA that were used in a second \nPCR with specific primers. However, as our technique does apply several amplification steps, \nwe should be aware of errors in the PCR product that might place clones from the same viral \npopulation at different positions in the tree. \n  Our objective with this study was to describe the distribution and diversity of \nphotosynthetic genes in different genomic size ranges of viral populations, using a culture-\nindependent approach such as PFGE in combination with cloning and sequencing. With PFGE \nit is possible to gain information about the dominant and presumably the most active viral \npopulations in the samples, without the need for a cultureable host.  So far, most knowledge on \nphotosynthetic genes in phages is based on cultured cyanophages isolated using two \ncyanobacterial strains; Synechococcus WH7803 and Prochlorococcus Med4 as hosts.  Recent \nestimates have shown that more than 99 % of marine bacteria (potential phage hosts) are \nunculturable (Rapp\u00e9 & Giovannoni, 2003), supporting the importance of a culture- independent \napproach for studies of genetically and functional viral diversity in environmental samples. \nCompared to other culture-independent approaches, e.g. metagenome cloning (Zeidner, et al., \n2005), PFGE also provides us information about the genome size of the viruses.  Such \n 12\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \ninformation can be used to suggest the likely family that these viruses belong to. Using this \napproach we discovered a much higher diversity in viral populations with photosynthetic genes \nthan previously reported. Our results document the naturally occurring genetic diversity among \nuncultured environmental viruses in samples from cold sea water.  Furthermore, the interesting \nfindings that viral populations of different sizes harbour photosynthetic genes that were \nphylogenetically similar supports the idea of promiscuous horizontal gene transfer of gene \nmodules within a common cyanophage gene pool. Thus, it might be hypothesized that marine \ncyanophages could have played a vital role in the evolution of photosynthetic gene diversity by \nproviding an accessible pool of portable genes and facilitating the reshuffling, acquisition and \nexchange of such genetic material. \n 13\nAcknowledgement 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n \nWe are grateful to Thomas S\u00f8rlie for collecting the sea water samples and Mette Hordnes \n(UiB) for providing the water temperature data.
