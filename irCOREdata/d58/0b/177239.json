There have been few attempts to study this in community health services. The present\nstudy investigated whether community occupational therapists\u2019 behaviour predicts children\u2019s length of time (LoT)\non caseloads.\nMethods: Retrospective survey of case notes of children recently discharged from occupational therapy services.\nUsing cluster random sampling, case notes were drawn from therapy records in six NHSScotland Health Boards.\nData about therapists\u2019 behaviours of assessing, treating, reviewing and discharging, together with child\ncharacteristics, were used to construct regression models of factors related to LoT.\nResults: Twenty-six therapists [median(IQR) time in paediatrics 8(6-13) years] and 154 of their cases [mean(SD) age\n7(3) years; median(IQR) LoT 10(3-21)] were included. A multi-level model, adjusting for clustering, for therapists\u2019\nactions of communicating assessment outcomes to parents, providing treatment, and placing the child on review,\nand for a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, explained 44% of variation in LoT.\nConclusions: Occupational therapists\u2019 caseload management behaviours are associated with children\u2019s LoT on\ncaseloads. Further research is required to investigate the direction of relationships between therapists\u2019 behaviours\nand LoT; and the relationships between contextual factors, therapists\u2019 caseload management behaviours and LoT.\nFurther exploration of therapists\u2019 beliefs about caseload management could also be useful in identifying possible\nfactors contributing to variation between therapists.\nBackground\nTimely and equitable access to treatments is a high\npriority both to those using, and to those delivering,\nhealthcare services [1]. In children\u2019s services both the\nbenefits of early intervention and the possible harms\nassociated with delayed intervention have been widely\ndocumented [2-5]. Parents\u2019 dissatisfaction with services\nhas been found to be triggered by lack of access to and\navailability of care rather than clinical outcomes [6]. Yet\nlong waiting times and large caseloads are a challenge to\nchildren\u2019s therapy services internationally [7-11].\nTo date, there have been few attempts to systemati-\ncally study the determinants of waiting times in chil-\ndren\u2019s community health services [12], or community\nhealth services more broadly [13-16]. Research in hospi-\ntal-based healthcare indicates that waiting times are a\nfunction of throughput [17] (i.e. flow of patients from\nthe start to the end of a care episode), and that through-\nput is influenced by a range of factors at different levels\nof care delivery, including (i) patient charatecteristics\n* Correspondence: n.kolehmainen@abdn.ac.uk\n1Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Health Sciences\nBuilding, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nKolehmainen et al.

What is perhaps less\nobvious is that clinicians\u2019 behaviour appears to mediate\nthe effects that patient characteristics and organisational\nand systems factors have on throughput and the length\nof care episodes [18-20]. For example, clinicians could\nbe limiting efficient allocation of the resources by keep-\ning clients on caseloads for longer than clinically needed\n[15,26,27]. This is consistent with evidence indicating\nthat, even after accounting for patient and organisational\nvariables, clinicians\u2019 behaviour is a strong determinant of\nthe care provided to patients [28].\nWhilst acknowledging the considerable differences in\nsystems and contexts of service provision between hos-\npital and community health care, clinicians\u2019 behaviour\ncould be one of the key variables relevant to investigat-\ning throughput and length of care episodes in commu-\nnity health care. Specifically, evidence of behaviours\npredicting children\u2019s length of time on caseload could\nbe used to develop a behaviour change intervention to\nimprove clinicians\u2019 caseload management.\nThis study explored the extent to which therapists\u2019\ncaseload management behaviours explain variation in\nchildren\u2019s length of time (LoT) on caseloads. Specifically,\nthe focus was on children\u2019s occupational therapists in\nScotland as the caseload management problems in these\nservices are considerable [9]. Specifically, this study\ninvestigated whether, after adjusting for children\u2019s char-\nacteristics, therapists\u2019 behaviours predict children\u2019s LoT\non caseloads. The related objectives were (i) to describe\ntherapists\u2019 current caseload management behaviours\n(both sequence and frequency of the behaviours); (ii) to\nidentify the variables that explain variation in LoT; and\n(iii) to establish the magnitude of the relationships\nbetween these variables and LoT.\nMethods\nA retrospective design was used. The dependent variable\nwas clients\u2019 LoT on caseload, operationalised as time in\nmonths from first appointment to date of discharge.\nIndependent variables were child characteristics (age in\nmonths at first appointment, gender, and medical diag-\nnoses listed in Table 1) and therapists\u2019 caseload manage-\nment behaviours (listed in Table 2). The specific\ncaseload management behaviours were selected from a\nreview of occupational therapy textbooks [29,30] and\nthe authors\u2019 (NK and ED) experience of occupational\ntherapy practice. These chosen behaviours mirror those\nincluded in professional standards for occupational\ntherapists caseload management [31] (published after\nthe conduct of the present study). Services within which\nthe therapists worked were described by their size (small\nwas < 10 therapists, mid-size was 10-20 therapists, large\nwas > 20 therapists) and geographical attributes (urban,\nsub-urban, rural).\nThe study was part of a wider programme of research\nconcerning children\u2019s occupational therapists\u2019 caseload\nmanagement in the UK. It was approved by the North\nof Scotland Research Ethics Committee 1 (ref: 07\/\nS0801\/55).\nSampling\nA computer-generated random number table was used\nto sample six NHSScotland (i.e. National Health Service)\nmainland occupational therapy services from a list of\nScottish children\u2019s occupational therapy managers. The\nsampled managers were contacted and with their agree-\nment all six services were included in the project.\nOccupational therapists were randomly sampled from\neach service: 5, 9 and 13 therapists from small, mid-size\nand large services, respectively. Eligibility criteria for\ntherapists were: employed by the participating service;\nhad a clinical involvement for a minimum of two days a\nweek with children living at home; and had a minimum\nof two cases discharged within the past five months.\nTherapy assistants and technical instructors were\nexcluded as their responsibility over clients\u2019 caseload\nmanagement is limited.\nFrom each participating therapist, eight discharged\ncases were sampled using a random number table.\nWhere therapists had fewer than eight discharged cases,\nall discharged cases were included. Parents of the chil-\ndren whose case notes had been sampled were informed\nabout the study and provided an opportunity to opt out.\nThe eligibility criteria for children were that they had\nbeen previously seen by a participating occupational\ntherapist and had been discharged a maximum of five\nmonths before sampling.

The\nfirst author extracted the LoT data, child characteristics\nand therapists\u2019 behaviours by using a structured form,\nwith guidance notes for classifying data and a policy for\ncoding ambiguous data (available from the authors).\nDates (year and month) for calculating both LoT and\nchild\u2019s age were recorded as presented in case notes.\nThe presence of any of the diagnoses and the caseload\nmanagement behaviours were recorded. Diagnoses were\nrecorded as categories, as opposed to verbatim, to\nensure anonymity of the data [32].\nThe data were collected September 2007 - January\n2008; were initially manually recorded in the software\npackage Microsoft Access, and then transferred to statis-\ntical packages. The data relating to therapists\u2019 current\ngrade and number of years in professional practice were\ncollected as part of the wider research programme [33]\nand entered in Microsoft Excel.\nSample size\nDue to a lack of previous studies in the field, no data\nwere available for a formal power calculation. However,\nwe initially aimed for 15 therapists and 150 cases to\nallow estimation of each therapist behaviour univariately\nin a simple regression model (adjusting for child level\nfactors) and identify candidate behaviours that predicted\nLoT. Fifteen therapists gives an effective sample size of\n15 at the therapist level (i.e. assuming the worst case\nscenario, i.e. that there is no variation between cases\nwithin therapists, there would be 15 data points) and\nallowed for the modelling of two to three therapist\nbehaviours in a multiple regression model. Based on\nother studies with professionals [34], a response rate of\n50-60% was expected.\nData Analysis\nThe data were initially described using mean(SD) (for\nage), median(IQR, interquartile range) (for LoT), or pro-\nportions (for gender, diagnoses and the caseload man-\nagement behaviours). Multilevel (ML) linear regression\nmodels, adjusted for clustering at the level of occupa-\ntional therapist [35], were used to explore the variation\nin LoT. Variation in LoT due to child characteristics\nwere initially explored using univariate linear regression.\nSimilarly the relationships between LoT and selected\ncaseload management behaviours were explored univari-\nately. Variables significant at the p = 0.05 level were\nthen combined in a ML multiple linear regression\nmodel. Due to the positively skewed distribution of LoT\nrobust standard errors were estimated [36] to ameliorate\npotentially spuriously narrow confidence intervals and\nlow p-values [37]. Interactions between selected caseload\nmanagement behaviours were explored by entering an\ninteraction term in the final model. All estimates are\npresented with 95% confidence intervals. Descriptive\nanalyses were performed in SPSS [38] and ML model-\nling was performed in Stata [39] using xtreg and robust\ncommands.\nResults\nData of included participants at each level of the ran-\ndom cluster sampling (service, therapist, case notes) are\npresented in Table 2. Participating services included a\nrange of community occupational therapy services\nacross NHSScotland, varying both in their size and geo-\ngraphical location. The response rate for therapists\nwithin the services ranged from 33-100%. Thirty-one\ntherapists responded (62%); five of them did not meet\nthe inclusion criteria (three did not have at least two\nrecently discharged cases and two did not have a mini-\nmum of two days per week clinical involvement with\nchildren living at home) resulting in a final study popu-\nlation of 26 (52%) therapists.

The three\nmost common diagnostic groups were: cerebral palsy\n(CP) (8%); attention difficulties, Autistic Spectrum Dis-\norder, Asperger\u2019s Syndrome or Tourette\u2019s (17%); and\ndevelopmental coordination disorder, dyspraxia or gen-\neral developmental delay (DCD\/GlobalDelay) (14%).\nOver a third (33%) of the cases did not have a diagnosis.\nTwelve percent (12%) had more than one diagnosis.\nMedian LoT for all cases was 10 months (IQR = 3-\n21). Three child characteristics explained a significant\namount of variation in LoT on caseload: age (in\nmonths), diagnosis of CP, and diagnosis of DCD\/Global-\nDelay. On average, older children remained on caseloads\nfor shorter time [-0.1 months, 95% confidence interval\n(CI) -0.2 to -0.02; p = 0.02]. For example, an increase in\nage by one year was associated with a reduction of 1.2\nmonths in time on a caseload (95% CI 0.3 to 2.6, p =\n0.02). When compared to children without a diagnosis,\nchildren with DCD\/GlobalDelay were likely to remain\non caseloads for 15 months (95% CI 5 to 24; p < 0.01)\nlonger, and children with CP for 44 months (95% CI 31\nto 59; p < 0.01) longer. The total amount of variation in\nLoT explained by these three variables was 29%.\nLength of time on caseloads and therapists\u2019 behaviours\nFrom the case note data, therapists performed assess-\nment behaviours with nearly all children, after which\nsome children were provided with treatment, some were\nplaced on review, and some were discharged. Of the\nchildren who were provided with treatment or placed\non review, only a limited proportion had therapy goals\nand plans. After receiving treatment or being reviewed,\nsome children were discharged immediately, whilst\nothers moved from treatment to review or vice versa\nbefore being discharged.\nFrequencies with which therapists performed the\ninvestigated behaviours are reported in Table 3. There\nwas little variation in therapists\u2019 assessment and dischar-\nging behaviours, and only some variation in forming\ntherapy goals and plans, making these unlikely beha-\nviours to explain variation in LoT. There was consider-\nable variation in providing treatment, including some\nvariation in the number of treatment sessions provided\n[median(IQR) 7(4-12)] but limited variation in the\nTable 3 Presence of the different caseload management behaviours in the included case notes (n = 154)\nProportion of cases in which the behaviour was recorded\nAssessment:\n1.

There was considerable varia-\ntion in placing children on review, but only some varia-\ntion in evaluating progress towards therapy goals and\nreporting treatment outcomes. The relationships\nbetween LoT and ten behaviours (Table 4) were further\ninvestigated univariately. Four of these behaviours\nexplained significant variation (p < 0.05) in LoT. These\nwere: communicating assessment outcomes to parents\nin writing, providing treatment, placing the child on\nreview and circulating a discharge summary or letter to\nparents.\nLength of time on caseloads and child characteristics and\ntherapists\u2019 behaviours\nThe four behaviours identified in Table 4 were entered\nin a regression model, together with (1) age, (2) DCD\/\nGlobalDelay, and (3) CP. The model was adjusted for\nclustering within therapist. Age, DCD\/GlobalDelay and\ncirculating a discharge summary to parents no longer\nexplained a significant amount of variation. These were\nsubsequently removed from the model. The four\nremaining variables of CP, communicating assessment\noutcomes to parents in writing, providing treatment\nand placing on review explained 44% of variation in\nLoT. Communicating assessment outcomes in writing\nwas associated with reduction in LoT of 15 months\n(95% CI -29 to -1; p = 0.04). Providing treatment was\nassociated with an increase in LoT of 7 months (95%\nCI 2 to 13; p < 0.01), and placing on review was asso-\nciated with an increase of 20 months (95% CI 13 to\n26; p < 0.01). Cerebral palsy (CP) continued to be\nassociated with a considerable increase in LoT [36\nmonths (95% CI 9 to 63; p < 0.01)]. Early exploration\nof the data had suggested a possible interaction\nbetween providing treatment and placing children on\nreview, however, this was not statistically significant\n[5 months (95% CI -8 to 18; p = 0.44)].\nFurther breakdown of mean LoTs and distribution of\nthe factors related to LoT, according to individual thera-\npist and as clustered within services, is presented in Fig-\nure 1 and Table 5. In services B, D and E, mean LoTs\nfor therapists were below or at the sample average, and\nvariation in mean LoTs between therapists was small. In\nall other services, there were no observed service-level\npatterns of therapists\u2019 mean LoTs.\nIn terms of distribution of the factors related to LoT\n(Table 5), therapists treating children with CP were\nsampled from all services. There appeared to be a trend\nfor therapists in services B and E to be more consistent\nin communicating assessment findings to parents in\nwriting, providing less treatment and placing fewer chil-\ndren on review than the sample average. With the\nexception of one therapist (E3), mean LoTs for thera-\npists in services B and E were below the sample average.\nFor all other services, the frequency of performing the\nthree behaviours and LoTs appeared to vary as much\nbetween therapists as between services.\nDiscussion\nAfter controlling for child-related factors, individual\ntherapists\u2019 caseload management behaviours were asso-\nciated with variation in the length of time (LoT) that\nthe children remained on therapists\u2019 caseloads. From the\ninvestigated child characteristics, only a diagnosis of cer-\nebral palsy explained a significant proportion of varia-\ntion in LoT after adjustments for therapist effects. The\nother variables included in the final model were: com-\nmunicating assessment outcomes to parents in writing;\nproviding treatment; and placing children on review.\nThis study has four major limitations. First, diagnosis\nwas the only measure of the cases\u2019 clinical features. It is\npossible that case characteristics other than diagnosis\n(e.g. performance in selected activities [42,43]) would\nbetter capture the key clinical features that influence\ntherapists\u2019 caseload management behaviours. However,\nTable 4 Behaviours explored univariately in relation to length of time (LoT) on caseload\nBehaviour Coefficient\n(months)\np-value 95% Confidence Interval\n(months)\nCommunicated assessment outcomes to parents\/carers in writing -28 < 0.01** -49 -8\nEstablished treatment goals 4 0.37 -5 13\nEstablished methods for achieving treatment goals -5 0.13 -12 2\nProvided treatment 19 < 0.01** 11 27\nMonitored progress against treatment goals 2 0.74 -8 11\nReported (i.e. established and recorded) treatment outcomes 3 0.78 -5 12\nPlaced the child on review 27 < 0.01** 18 35\nEstablished reasons for discharge -3 0.70 -16 11\nProvided a discharge summary or letter -22 0.05 -45 0\nCirculated the summary or letter to parents\/carers -19 0.03* -36 -2\nKolehmainen et al. BMC Health Services Research 2010, 10:249\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/10\/249\nPage 5 of 9\nthere is currently no agreement about what these char-\nacteristics are and there are few standardised measures\nto assess them, leaving diagnosis as the most feasible\nand reliable variable on which to base this analysis. Sec-\nond, the study used retrospective data and it is not pos-\nsible to make conclusions about the directions of\npotential causal relationships. A further experimental\nstudy is required to establish these. Third, the generali-\nsability of the results is limited to children\u2019s senior occu-\npational therapists in NHSScotland, as the contextual\nfactors (e.g. policies, models of practice) may be differ-\nent in other locations and with other therapist popula-\ntions in a way not considered in this study. The study\ncould be replicated in other settings to further investi-\ngate the influence of organisational and system-level fac-\ntors on therapists\u2019 caseload management behaviours, and\non the relationship between the behaviours and LoT.\nFourth, the therapists sampled from each service may\nnot be fully representative of that service, and the\nresponse rate varied between services. It is therefore\npossible that in reality, there is more or less variation\nbetween therapists in specific services than is evident\nfrom these data.\nFrom the four variables identified to relate to LoT in\nthis study, therapists\u2019 behaviours may be modifiable\nwhereas a diagnosis of cerebral palsy is not. The magni-\ntude of the relationships between length of time on\ncaseload and the identified caseload management\nbehaviours suggests that, if the relationships are causal,\nchanging the behaviours could result in a change in\nLoT.\nTherapists\u2019 behaviours and length of time on caseload\nIn terms of developing hypotheses about the directions\nof the relationships identified in this study, providing\ntreatment typically takes place early in the care process\nand inevitably means that the therapist has to keep the\nchild on caseload. This suggests that the direction of\nthis relationship could be from treatment provision to\nlonger length of time on caseloads. Communicating\nassessment findings to parents also takes place early in\nthe process; however, the relationship between this and\nLoT is more difficult to theorise. This apparent rela-\ntionship could result from therapists discharging the\nchild and providing a written assessment report as a\ndischarge summary, or it could be that communicating\nassessment findings in writing is influenced by a con-\nfounding variable related to it and LoT (e.g. therapists\u2019\napproach to communicating with parents). Placing a\nchild on review typically takes place after the child has\nstayed on the caseload for some time, and thus it is\ndifficult to draw further conclusions about the direc-\ntion of this relationship. It is possible that children are\nplaced on review and subsequently remain on case-\nloads for longer, or that children are reviewed because\nthey have remained on caseloads. An experimental\nFigure 1 Boxplots of length of time. Boxplots of length of time (LoT) for therapists (n = 26) clustered within the six services (from A to F).\nKolehmainen et al.

Further\nexploration of therapists\u2019 beliefs about caseload man-\nagement could also be useful in identifying other pos-\nsible factors contributing to variation between\ntherapists.\nThe behaviours associated with LoT do not occur in\nisolation but as part of a sequence of caseload manage-\nment behaviours that may be interdependent. The pre-\nsent study identified that therapists formulate goals,\nmonitor progress towards goals and report outcomes\ninfrequently. Whilst these behaviours were not related\nto LoT in this study, it may be important to understand\nthe processes between the behaviours. For example,\ntherapy goals can be hypothesised to direct [44] thera-\npists to provide treatment efficiently, and the lack of\nthese goals could contribute to treatment provision for\nchildren who may not require treatment. Further\nexploration of the processes related to therapists\u2019 case-\nload management behaviours is required in order to\ndevelop a theoretically coherent understanding of case-\nload management.\nDiagnosis and contextual factors\nThe finding that a diagnosis of cerebral palsy explains\nLoT is unsurprising as these children can be perceived\nas having \u2018complex needs\u2019. In terms of the direction of\nany causal relationship, having cerebral palsy is likely\nto contribute to longer length of time on caseload, as\nthe opposite (i.e. time on caseload contributing to cer-\nebral palsy) is unlikely. However, the substantially long\ntimes that these children are kept on caseloads is pro-\nblematic in that there is currently scarce evidence\nabout the benefits of the occupational therapy\nTable 5 Proportion of children with cerebral palsy, therapists\u2019 caseload management behaviours, and mean LoT for\neach therapist within the six services\nService code: therapist % of cases with\ncerebral palsy (n\/N)\u03be\nCommunicated assessment\nfindings to parents in writing (%)\u00a5\nProvided treatment (%)\u00a5 Placed on\nreview (%)\u00a5\nLength of Time\non caseload\n[Median (IQR)]\u00b1\nA:1 50 (4\/8) 75 50 50 14 (2-135)\nA:2 13 (1\/8) 75 50 38 15 (8-70)\nA:3 0 (0\/8) 100 88 50 20 (12-24)\nA:4 0 (0\/3) 33 100 33 10 (2-17)\nA:5 50 (1\/2) 100 100 0 12 (6-17)\nA:6 33 (1\/3) 0 100 100 43 (42-61)\nB:1 0 (0\/8) 100 63 25 4 (1-11)\nB:2 0 (0\/8) 100 50 25 6 (4-11)\nB:3 13 (1\/8) 88 88 50 8 (4-14)\nB:4 0 (0\/3) 100 33 0 4 (3-5)\nB:5 0 (0\/6) 100 50 50 6 (3-13)\nB:6 17 (1\/6) 84 17 100 3 (2-7)\nC:1 0 (0\/8) 88 25 50 6 (1-16)\nC:2 0 (0\/6) 84 83 67 35 (21-52)\nC:3 50 (1\/2) 100 100 100 47 (7-87)\nC:4 0 (0\/5) 60 40 80 11 (5-23)\nD:1 0 (0\/8) 88 38 50 7 (1-27)\nD:2 0 (0\/8) 75 38 63 10 (2-24)\nD:3 14 (1\/7) 100 57 71 10 (1-26)\nE:1 0 (0\/5) 100 20 20 3 (1-8)\nE:2 50 (1\/2) 100 100 0 3 (1-4)\nE:3 0 (0\/8) 100 63 50 20 (3-56)\nE:4 20 (1\/5) 40 40 20 4 (1-39)\nF:1 0 (0\/8) 100 50 75 15 (7-20)\nF:2 40 (2\/5) 60 60 80 21 (21-75)\nF:3 0 (0\/6) 50 83 50 10 (4-24)\nTotal sample: 10 (15\/154) 83 57 47 10 (3-21)\n\u03be In this column, samples consisting children with cerebral palsy are highlighted bold\n\u00a5 In this column, bold is used to indicate where assessment findings were communicated more frequently in writing\/treatment was provided less frequently\/\nchildren were placed on a review less frequently than the sample average\n\u00b1 Median LoT shorter than the sample average\nKolehmainen et al.

In the broader context of\nefficient resource use, it would be important to estab-\nlish good-quality evidence about the costs and benefits\nof keeping these children on caseloads for such long\nperiods.\nDescriptive exploration of the clustering of the chil-\ndren\u2019s mean lengths of time on caseloads and therapists\u2019\nbehaviours within occupational therapy services sug-\ngested that organisational and\/or contextual factors may\nhave some influence on therapists\u2019 behaviours and the\nlengths of time on caseloads. Further exploration of the\nrelationships between the different caseload manage-\nment behaviours and the broader context within which\nthey are carried out is required.\nImplications for future research\nThis study supports the hypothesis of an association\nbetween therapists\u2019 behaviours and children\u2019s length of\ntime on caseload. If future research provides plausible\nevidence for causal relationship then there is the poten-\ntial for reducing children\u2019s length of time on caseloads\nby targeting therapists\u2019 behaviours. Future research\ncould investigate how treatment provision and placing\nchildren on review relate to other caseload management\nbehaviours, that is, what are the processes linking the\nbehaviours and children\u2019s length of time on therapists\u2019\ncaseloads. Further research is also required to investigate\nthe relationships and interactions between therapists\u2019\nbehaviours and the context (including the child, the\norganisation, etc) within which the behaviours are car-\nried out. Finally, further exploration of therapists\u2019 beliefs\nabout caseload management could also be useful in\nidentifying other possible factors contributing to varia-\ntion between therapists.\nConclusions\nOccupational therapists\u2019 caseload management beha-\nviours are associated with children\u2019s LoT on caseloads.\nFurther research is required to investigate the direction\nof relationships between therapists\u2019 behaviours and LoT;\nand the relationships between contextual factors, thera-\npists\u2019 caseload management behaviours and LoT.\nFurther exploration of therapists\u2019 beliefs about caseload\nmanagement could also be useful in identifying possible\nfactors contributing to variation between therapists.\nAcknowledgements\nAuthors would like to thank: all the therapists and parents of children who\nallowed extraction of data from the children\u2019s case notes; Professors Adrian\nGrant and Lorna McKee for advice and contribution to the overall\nprogramme of research; and Mr Dan Barnett and Ms Lara Kemp for their\nsupport in data management.
