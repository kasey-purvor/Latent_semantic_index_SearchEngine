An intriguing argument by political historians (see, e.g., Charles Tilly 1990) holds that \nstate capacity evolved historically over centuries in response to the exigencies of war. War placed \na premium on sources of taxation and created incentives for governments to invest in revenue-\nraising institutions.1\nMore recent historical links between the introduction\/development of modern income tax sys-\ntems and the onset or risk of war also provides some interesting clues. For example, Britain first \nintroduced an income tax in the budget of 1798, given the pressure on its public finances due to \nthe Napoleonic War. The United States first introduced a form of income taxation in 1861 during \nthe Civil War, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was founded on the back of this with the \nRevenue Act of 1862. Both countries significantly extended their income tax systems during the \nFirst and Second World Wars; in Britain, for example, the pay-as-you-earn method of tax col-\nlection was introduced in 1944. In Sweden, a system of relatively uniform permanent taxation \nof land and temporary taxation of wealth goes back as far as the thirteenth century. Sweden first \nintroduced a general income tax in 1861 and an expanded progressive income tax in 1903, in \nboth cases with the motive to increase military expenditures. Our analysis will suggest that the \nsignificance of war and military spending in state capacity building comes from the fact that it is \nan archetypical public good representing broadly common interests for citizens.\n1 Patrick O\u2019Brien (2005) argues that British naval hegemony over nearly three hundred years was rooted in the supe-\nrior power to raise taxes. John Brewer (1989) and Philip Hoffman and Jean-Laurent Rosenthal (1997) discuss the link \nbetween the development of taxation and political institutions, such as parliamentary democracy.\nThe Origins of State Capacity:  \nProperty Rights, Taxation, and Politics\nBy Timothy Besley and Torsten Persson*\nEconomists generally assume that the state has sufficient institutional capac-\nity to support markets and levy taxes. This paper develops a framework where \n\u201cpolicy choices\u201d in market regulation and taxation are constrained by past \ninvestments in legal and fiscal capacity. It studies the economic and political \ndeterminants of such investments, demonstrating that legal and fiscal capacity \nare typically complements. The results show that, among other things, common \ninterest public goods, such as fighting external wars, as well as political stabil-\nity and inclusive political institutions, are conducive to building state capacity. \nSome correlations in cross-country data are consistent with the theory.

The Arrow-Debreu model implicitly \nassumes a government that flawlessly enforces contracts. Studies of optimal taxation explicitly \nacknowledge informational constraints, but implicitly assume a bureaucracy able and willing to \nenforce any tax policy respecting those constraints. Positive analyses in political economics of \nhow the power to tax or regulate is chosen in a political equilibrium with collective choice makes \nthe same implicit assumption. This starting point cannot safely be taken for granted in many \nstates, neither historically nor in the developing world of today. One motivation for our paper is \nto fill that lacuna in the theoretical literature.\nAnother motivation is to provide answers to some empirical questions in development. Why \nare rich countries also high-tax countries with good enforcement of contracts and property \nrights? Why do parliamentary democracies have better property rights protection and higher \ntaxes than presidential democracies? Why is it so hard to find evidence in aggregate data that \nhigh taxation is negatively related to growth, while there seems to be good evidence that poor \nproperty rights protection is?\nIf state capacities do indeed impose effective constraints, we will be able to gauge them \nthrough current measures of taxation and market development. Figure 1 illustrates a positive \ncorrelation between measures of the power to tax and of financial development. It graphs the \nshare of government revenue raised from income taxes as a share of GDP against the average \nprivate credit to GDP ratio (both measured as a percentage in 1995; see Section IV for more on \nthe underlying data). The figure also illustrates a positive correlation between both these mea-\nsures and income per capita. (Countries below median income per capita are marked by solid \ndots and countries above median income per capita are marked with hollow dots.) Clearly, poorer \ncountries are scattered to the south west in the graph, while the richer ones cluster in the north \neast. Our theory will emphasize that nothing causal can be read into these correlation patterns. \nWhatever the explanation for these cross-country correlations, however, they are hard to square \nwith simplistic notions that having a small government is a precondition for being a rich and \ndeveloped nation; they rather suggest that higher taxation and financial development have com-\nmon underlying causes.\nIn this paper, we propose a model to better understand some of these historical, theoretical, \nand empirical issues. The contribution is to put together a number of factors in a unified frame-\nwork. Of course, we cannot build a model of everything, so we focus on two specific aspects \nof state capacity. In our framework, regulation of market supporting measures and tax rates are \nendogenous policy choices. But these are constrained by the state\u2019s \u201clegal\u201d and \u201cfiscal\u201d capac-\nity, economic institutions inherited from the past. Current policy choices also reflect political \nregimes inherited from the past. We then explore the relationships between taxes and property \nrights, redistribution versus the provision of public goods, income levels, and political regimes. \nKey to our model is to treat the state\u2019s legal and fiscal capacity as ex ante investments under \nuncertainty.2\nOne of our central findings is that investments in legal and fiscal capacity are often comple-\nments. On the analytical side, this complementarity allows us to use results from monotone \ncomparative statics, which considerably simplifies the analysis. On the substantive side, the \nanalysis provides a complete set of determinants of investments in state capacity, including \nthe importance of common interest public goods, the level of wealth, the gains from trade in \n financial markets, political stability and protection of minorities, and the distribution of eco-\nnomic and political power. Moreover, the complementarity suggests a new way of thinking about \n2 The general idea of studying dynamic investments in institutions that affect subsequent policy choices is similar in \nspirit to Roger Lagunoff (2001), and to the literature on strategic debt issue (Persson and Lars E. O. Svensson 1989).\nSEpTEmBER 20091220 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\nthe interaction between economic growth and the size of government. On the empirical side, the \n complementarity leads to the prediction that we should indeed find common determinants of \nboth types of state capacity. We find support for this idea in a preliminary look at the data.\nOur paper makes contact with several strands of literature. It is clearly related to the body of \nwork on the economic and political history of the state, mentioned above. While that literature is \nfocused primarily on the state\u2019s capacity to raise revenue, it does not emphasize\u2014as we do\u2014the \nlinks with the state\u2019s capacity to support market institutions. The same is true of the emerging \nliterature in public finance that takes seriously issues of compliance as a constraint on effective \ntaxation (for an overview see Joel B. Slemrod and Shlomo Yitzhaki 2002).\nOur paper is also related to the recent work seeking to explain the institutions that support \nfinancial markets, such as the protection of minority shareholders or private property rights (see, \nfor example, Rafael La Porta et al. 1998; Raghuram G. Rajan and Luigi Zingales 2003; Daron \nAcemoglu and Simon Johnson 2005; Marco Pagano and Paolo F. Volpin 2005). As in that work, \nour analysis treats market-supporting institutions as endogenous. But we analyze market support-\ning institutions together with taxation, which allows us to address the crucial \u201cCoase theorem\u201d \nquestion why a particular ruling group would not provide maximum efficiency of markets and \nfurther its own selfish interests through redistributive taxation.3 We also make a clear distinction \nbetween economic institutions and policy choices constrained by these institutions. This distinc-\ntion allows us to consider how economic and political factors shape economic institutions.4\nThe closest antecedent to this paper is Acemoglu (2005), which develops a model where a gov-\nernment raises taxes to spend on a mixture of transfers to the ruler and productivity-enhancing \npublic goods. Spending on public goods increases future tax revenues. Weak states where rulers \n3 Acemoglu (2006) considers the spillovers to regulatory policies of the state\u2019s capacity to tax, but treats the latter \nas exogenous.\n4 On this point, our approach is related to the theoretical and empirical work by Alex Cukierman, Sebastian Edwards \nand Guido Tabellini (1992) on how the use of seignorage depends on the efficiency of the tax system, and how the stra-\ntegic choice of the latter depends on political stability and polarization.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nS\nha\nre\n o\nf i\nnc\nom\ne \nta\nxe\ns \nin\n G\nD\nP\n0 50 100 150 200\nAbove median income Below median income\nFitted values\nFigure 1.

Also related is Acemoglu, \nDavide Ticchi, and Andrea Vindigni (2007), which studies the role of bureaucracies in creating \n(in)effective states.\nAs already mentioned, we build a simple two-period model where past investments in legal \nand fiscal capacity constrain current policy decisions. Section I formulates this model and stud-\nies equilibrium private decisions. Section II analyzes policy choices for given institutions, when \nthese choices are made by a utilitarian planner or by self-interested governments that can be \nreplaced. In Section III we analyze the optimal and equilibrium investments in legal and fiscal \ncapacity. We present comparative statics for the economic and political determinants of legal \nand fiscal capacity and spell out the implications for economic growth. Section IV presents some \nempirical evidence. Section V concludes.\nI. Model and Private Choices\nWe construct a simple intertemporal model with two main building blocks\u2014trade in a private \ncapital market and taxing\/spending by government.\nA. Basics\nTo allow for investment in as simple a way as possible, there are two periods s \u2208 {1, 2}. Markets \nare open in both periods and consumers cannot save. Preferences of private agents are linear in \nprivate consumption, as well as in government spending (see below).\nIn each period the government in power makes policy decisions on regulation, taxes, and \nspending. In period 1, the government makes investments in institutions, knowing that the world \nends in period 2. This simple framework captures the essentials of a representative time period \nwithin a fully specified dynamic model.\nTo model conflicting interests in the simplest possible way, we assume that there are two \ngroups, J \u2208 {A, B}. Group membership is due to some attribute that is observable by everybody, \nincluding the government. These groups make up shares \u03b2 A, \u03b2 B of the population. For simplicity, \nall agents within each group have the same wealth level, w J .\nB. productive Opportunities\nTo give a rationale for the capital market, we assume that individuals differ not only in publicly \nobservable group membership, but also in privately observed production opportunities. Each \nperson can engage in a project where the gross return for individual I is rI,s \u2208 {rL, rH} and rH > rL. \nWe denote the share of group J agents with high returns by \u03c3  J (the same in each time period), \nsuch that type H individuals in group J make up a share \u03b2  J\u03c3  J of the total population.\nC. Borrowing, property Rights protection, and Legal capacity\nEntrepreneurs can expand the size of projects by borrowing in a competitive capital market. \nTo prevent default, a member of group J can put up a share of her wealth w J as collateral. While \ncontracts between borrowers and lenders are upheld by the legal system, we assume that only \na share  p s J \u2264 1 of collateral is \u201ceffective,\u201d where  p s J is an index for the enforcement of property \nrights. Since lenders (and borrowers) have linear preferences,  p s J can be interpreted as the prob-\nability that a lender gains access to collateral in case of default. As collateralized investment will \nSEpTEmBER 20091222 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\nearn no less than the (gross) market return rs in period s, someone from group J can borrow only \nas much as she will be expected to repay at rs .\nWe model  p s J , J = A, B, as a policy choice by the government which is taken before private \nchoices are made. We say that property-rights protection is better for group J, when  p s J is higher, \nas this allows more borrowing for each piece of collateral. Property-rights protection can be \ndifferentiated by observable group J, but not by unobservable type I. Group-specific protection \nreflects the possibility that resources put into contract enforcement may depend on the sector or \ngeographic location of economic activity. Property rights are universal if  p s  A =  p s  B , i.e., when \neveryone in the economy has equal access to contract enforcement.\nThe choice of how well to enforce private property rights in period s is constrained to the \ninterval:  p s  J \u2208 [0, \u03c0s ], where the maximum protection level \u03c0s is determined by past investments \nin \u201clegal capacity.\u201d In concrete terms, this reflects legal infrastructure such as building court \nsystems, employing judges, and registering property. The initial stock is \u03c01 and the investment in \nperiod 1 is thus given by \u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01. Because there is no depreciation of legal capacity, we require \u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01 \u2265 0. The costs of such investments are given by L(\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01), an increasing convex func-\ntion with L(0) = L\u03c0(0) = 0. 5\nThe cost function L( \u00b7 ) could, for example, be dependent on the legal origin of a country: the \ncost of protecting property rights may be lower under common law than under civil law. Because \na higher value of \u03c0s allows for more extensive financial contracts, it allows for more credit as \na share of total output. As the ratio of private (or total) credit to GDP is often used to measure \nfinancial development empirically, we expect \u03c0s to be closely related to that measure.\nIt is important to note that, in our model, property rights refer to protection against risk of \nexpropriation by other private agents and not by the government. Government expropriation is \nruled out by assumption. As discussed in the concluding section, a more complete theory of how \nstate capacity develops would also include safeguards against public expropriation.\nD. Spending, Taxes, and fiscal capacity\nThe other current policy instrument is taxation of the net (after lending or borrowing) output \nfrom investment projects. The government can observe net output brought to the market by \na member of group J, but not whether the output has been derived from a high or low return \nproject or through lending.6 Thus, tax rates in period s can be made group specific,  t s  J , but not \nproject specific. We will say that the tax system is fair when both groups are taxed at the same \nrate:  t s  A =  t s  B . To allow for redistribution in the simplest possible way, we allow tax rates to be \nnegative.\nTaxation is constrained because any individual can earn a fraction (1 \u2212 \u03c4s ) of her returns\u2014\neither from projects or lending\u2014in an informal sector where he\/she avoids taxation. This implies \nthat the tax rates in period s must satisfy  t s  J \u2264 \u03c4s (see Appendix). As with legal capacity, these \nnontaxable fractions are determined by investments. Here, what we have in mind is the build-up \nof institutions such as an administration (like the IRS in the United States) for the collection of \nincome taxes, a system for the monitoring of tax compliance, etc.7\n5 This function, as well as an analogous function capturing the cost of investing in fiscal capacity, could be made \nproportional to income per capita in the period when investment takes place. Equally, we could allow for depreciation. \nThese extensions would complicate the algebra without affecting the substantive insights in this two-period setting.\n6 This parallels the standard informational assumption made in the optimal income tax literature. The restriction to \nlinear income taxes is not important, because in our framework, without labor-leisure or savings choices, taxes do not \ndistort private actions.\n7 An interesting possibility is that the same institutions that facilitate market transactions\u2014such as a well-functioning \naudit system\u2014also facilitate the taxation of individuals or firms. In this paper, we abstract from such \u201c administrative \nVOL. 99 NO. 4 1223BESLEy ANd pERSSON: ORIgINS Of STATE cApAcITy\nLet \u03c41 be the initial (i.e., period 1) stock of \u201cfiscal capacity\u201d (a higher \u03c4 raises the feasible tax \nrate). As legal capacity, fiscal capacity does not depreciate but can be augmented by nonnegative \ninvestment in period 1, which costs f(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41). We assume f(0) = f\u03c4(0) = 0. It is plausible to \nthink that investments in fiscal capacity are cheaper in a modern society than in a less developed \none.\nApart from the need to invest in legal and fiscal capacity and the possibility to redistribute \nacross groups, there is an additional, public-goods motive for raising taxes. Public goods have a \nlinear payoff, \u03b1s gs  , common to all individuals. We assume that \u03b1s has a distribution of possible \nrealizations, with c.d.f. H and p.d.f. h, on [0,  __ \u03b1 ] where  __ \u03b1 > 1. This shock is assumed to be i.i.d. \nover time. The realized value of \u03b1s is known when taxes  t s  J are set in period s. But when invest-\nments in fiscal capacity take place in period 1, the future value, \u03b12, is stochastic and the investing \ngovernment knows only its distribution. A first-order stochastic dominating shift in this distribu-\ntion represents greater perceived benefits of public goods, for example, due to a greater risk of \nwar in future. In this interpretation, \u03b1s represents the threat of war and gs the level of defense. \nAnother interpretation would be a broad \u201cwelfare-state program\u201d that gives benefits in common \nto both groups.\nE. capital market Equilibrium\nIndividual choices are easy to characterize (see the Appendix for a formal treatment). They \nimply horizontal demands for borrowing up to the point \u03c3 J \u03b2  J  p s  J w J by high-return members \nof group J, i.e., these individuals put up all their wealth as collateral and invest maximally. \nConversely, individuals with low returns are happy to lend at any market rate rs \u2265 rL, implying a \nhorizontal supply of lending up to the point (1 \u2212 \u03c3 J  ) \u03b2  J w J by low-return individuals in group J.\nWe assume that the maximal supply of lending exceeds the maximal demand for borrowing. \nThis will be the case if the number of high-return projects is relatively low. Then, in a competi-\ntive equilibrium, the interest rate will be rL. If we make the \u201cnatural\u201d assumption that lenders in \neach group invest the same portion, ls, of their wealth, we can write the market-clearing condi-\ntion as\n(1)  \u03c3 A \u03b2  A  p s  A w  A + \u03c3 B \u03b2 B  p s  B w B = ls[((1 \u2212 \u03c3 A)\u03b2  A w A + (1 \u2212 \u03c3 B  )\u03b2 B w B  ].\nF. Indirect Utilities\nPutting these components together yields indirect utility functions for individuals in group J \ndepending on whether they have access to a low or high return project:\n(2)   v H,s  J ( t s  J ,  p s  J , gs) = \u03b1sgs + (1 \u2212  t s  J  )(rH +  p s  J (rH \u2212 rL ))w J\nand\n(3)   v L,s  J  ( t s  J ,  p s  J , gs) = \u03b1s gs + (1 \u2212  t s  J  )rLw J.\ncomplementarities\u201d and show that legal and fiscal capacity naturally become complements even in their absence.\nSEpTEmBER 20091224 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\nG. Tax Bases and government Budget constraints\nAs a preliminary, define per capita net output in each group:\n(4)  y (  p s  J , \u03c3 J, w J  ) = [\u03c3  J(1 +  p s  J )(rH \u2212 rL ) + rL  ]w J.\nNotice that the y( \u00b7 ) function is increasing in  p s J , because more property rights protection for \ngroup J allows for more financial intermediation, which raises net output. It is also increasing in \nw J and \u03c3 J since richer individuals can afford larger projects, and surpluses are generated only \nby agents with high returns. Moreover, the gain from property rights protection, yp( p, \u03c3 J, w J ) = (rH \u2212 rL )\u03c3 Jw J, is increasing in wealth and the share of high-return agents, yp w , yp\u03c3 > 0, as \nboth make efficiency gains more important. We will occasionally use the shorthand notation \nys = \u03b2 A y(  p s  A , \u03c3 A, w A) + \u03b2B y( p s  B , \u03c3 B, w B ) to denote national income in period s.\nIn this notation, we can write (average) indirect utility for group J as\n(5)   v s  J = \u03b1sgs + (1 \u2212  t s  J ) y(  p s  J , \u03c3 J, w J  ).\nThe government budget constraints are\n(6)   \u2211 \nJ\n \n \n   t 1 \n J \u03b2 J y(  p 1 J, \u03c3 J, w J  ) = g1 + [L(\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01) + f(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41)] \nin period 1, and\n(7)   \u2211 \nJ\n \n \n t 2 \n J \u03b2 J y(  p 2 J, \u03c3 J, w J  ) = g2\nin period 2 (when there are no investments).\nH. political Regimes\nWe represent political regimes in a simple reduced-form way, allowing for self-interested gov-\nernments and political turnover. Thus, in each period, power is held by a government, which \n(over)represents group A or group B. We parameterize government preferences by the weights \nthey attach to the utility of each group. Formally, let  \u03c6 J J \u2265 \u03b2 J denote the weight that group J gives \nto itself when holding political power, and  \u03c6 J K \u2264 \u03b2K the weight group J gives to group K \u2260 J. We \nnormalize so that  \u03c6 J J +  \u03c6 J K = 1. It is most convenient to work with an \u201coverweighting\u201d parameter \u03c1 = \u03c6\/\u03b2. For ease of exposition, we deal with a symmetric case where\n  \n__ \u03c1 =    \u03c6 A \n A \n ____\u03b2  A  =  \n \u03c6 B  B  ___\u03b2  B  \u2265  __ \u03c1 =  \n \u03c6 A  B  ___\u03b2 B  =  \n \u03c6 B  A  ___\u03b2 A  .\nEach group thus attaches the same relative weight to its own group.8\nWhile quite specific, this way of modeling politics has the advantage of nesting the utilitarian \nsocial planning outcome as a special case. Specifically,  \n__ \u03c1 =  __ \u03c1 = 1 (i.e.,  \u03c6 J  J = \u03b2 J and  \u03c6 J  K = \u03b2K  ) \nrepresents the weights that would be used by a utilitarian social planner. We shall compare the \npolitically determined policies to the utilitarian benchmark as we proceed.\n8 This is more than a normalization. However, it conveniently allows us to avoid indexing  \n__ \u03c1 and  __ \u03c1 by K and J. \nVOL. 99 NO. 4 1225BESLEy ANd pERSSON: ORIgINS Of STATE cApAcITy\nWe use the binary indicator \u03b3s \u2208 {A, B} to denote the type of government in period s, and the \nparameter \u03b3 J \u2208 [0, 1] to denote the (exogenously given) probability that the policymaker is of type \nJ in each period.\nWhile it would be preferable to develop a structural model of politics\u2014something that we \nleave for future work\u2014the parameters ( __ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1) and \u03b3 J can still be given plausible institutional \ninterpretations. We will interpret a smaller difference ( __ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1) as a more representative politi-\ncal system, such as a more democratic regime.9 Moreover, among democracies it is common to \nargue (see Section III below) that parliamentary rather than presidential systems of government, \nand proportional rather than majoritarian systems of elections, generate more consensual politi-\ncal outcomes. Such consensus can be thought of as a smaller gap ( __ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1) between the welfare \nweights of the groups in and out of power. We will think of greater political stability, whatever the \nrepresentativeness of the system, as a higher value of \u03b3  J when group J holds power in period 1.\nI. Timing\nIn each period, s, the economy starts out with some given fiscal and legal capacity, {\u03c0s , \u03c4s}.

Policy Choices\nWe first study the choice of taxes, property-rights enforcement, and public spending in each \nperiod. Given the (linear) structure of our model, these choices can be studied separately from \nthe investment decisions in period 1.\nLet group J be in power and group K be out of power in period s.

Benchmark Utilitarian Optimum\nTo provide a benchmark for the analysis, we begin with the special case  \n__ \u03c1 =  __ \u03c1 = 1, i.e., where \nthe policy choices are made by a utilitarian social planner in period s. This will be interesting in \npart to see what aspects of normative analysis are also features of politically determined policy.10 \nOur results for this case are summarized in:\nPROPOSITION 1: In the utilitarian case  \n__ \u03c1 =  __ \u03c1 = 1), policy is as follows:\n (i) for s \u2208 {1, 2} and any \u03b3s \u2208 {A, B}, \u03b1s \u2208 [0,  __ \u03b1 ], equilibrium property rights always fully \nutilize all legal capacity\n  p s \n J =  p s K = \u03c0s.\n (ii) If \u03b1s \u2265 1, then taxable capacity on both groups is fully utilized,\n  t s \n J =  t s K = \u03c4s,\n  and public goods are provided as\n g1 = \u03c41 y1 \u2212 L(\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01) \u2212 f(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41) and g2 = \u03c42 y2.\n (iii) If \u03b1s < 1, for all J, K \u2208 {A, B}, gs = 0, for s \u2208 {1, 2} and  t 2  J =  t 2  K = 0 with  t 1  J =  t 1  K =  \u02c6    t1, \nwhere\n  \u02c6    t1 y1 = L(\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01) + f(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41).\nThe result in part (i) that legal capacity is fully utilized rests on the straightforward observa-\ntion that the indirect utility function in (8) is increasing in both  p s J and  p s K . Intuitively, better \nproperty-rights enforcement raises the availability of public and\/or private goods, for any given \ntax vector ( t s  A ,  t s  B ). That legal capacity is always fully utilized ex post is essentially an applica-\ntion, in this context, of the famous Peter A. Diamond and James A. Mirrlees (1971) production \nefficiency result.\nOptimal taxation cum public goods provision depends on the realization of \u03b1s. Part (ii) shows \nthat when \u03b1s \u2265 1, individuals in both groups are taxed up to available fiscal capacity, and tax \nrevenue is used solely to finance public goods, except that the period 1 government also needs to \npay for investments in state capacity (which implies less public goods provision). To prove this \nresult, notice that when  \n__ \u03c1 =  __ \u03c1 = 1 a change in the tax rates of groups J and K to finance higher \nspending on public goods, by the government budget constraint, change the objective (8) by \n10 Acemoglu, Michael Golosov, and Aleh Tysvinski (2008) pursue the same kind of issues in a different context.\nVOL. 99 NO. 4 1227BESLEy ANd pERSSON: ORIgINS Of STATE cApAcITy\n(\u03b1s \u2212 1)\u03b2  J y(  p s  J , \u03c3 J, w J  ) d t s  J and (\u03b1s \u2212 1)\u03b2 K y(  p s K , \u03c3 K, w J ) d t s K , respectively. Since the derivatives \nare constant, a corner solution is optimal. Intuitively, in a \u201cwar-time\u201d economy the social value \nof public goods (\u03b1s) is higher than the social value of private goods (1).\nWhen the social value of public goods is lower than that of private goods, no public goods are \nprovided by reversal of the same argument. Further, part (iii) prescribes zero tax rates in period \n2 while, in period 1, taxes are levied solely to fund investments in state capacity. The government \nbudget constraint shows that a decrease in  t s \n J financed by an increase in  t s \n K affects the objective \n(8) by [ A(\u03b2 J y(  p s  J , \u03c3 J, w J ) (\u03b2 K y( p s  K , \u03c3 K, w K ))\/(\u03b2 J y(  p s  J , \u03c3 J, w J  ))B \u2212 \u03b2 K y(  p s  K , \u03c3 K, w K  )]d t s  K = 0. \nIntuitively, since the two groups have the same constant marginal utility of income (namely 1), \na utilitarian planner gains nothing from redistributing across groups, Without loss of generality, \nwe can assume that both groups face the same tax rate.\nWe now turn to optimal policy when policy choices are politically determined. For this case, \nwe have the following:\nPROPOSITION 2: With political control  \n__ \u03c1 > 1 >  _ \u03c1, policy is as follows:\n (i) for s \u2208 {1, 2} and any \u03b3s \u2208 {A, B}, \u03b1s \u2208 [0,  __ \u03b1 ], equilibrium property rights always fully \nutilize all legal capacity\n  p s \n J =  p s  K = \u03c0s.\n (ii) If \u03b1s \u2265  __ \u03c1 , then taxable capacity on both groups is fully utilized,\n  t s \n J =  t s  K = \u03c4s,\n  and public goods are provided as\n g1 = \u03c41y1 \u2212 L(\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01) + f(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41) and g2 = \u03c42y2 .\n (iii) If \u03b1s <  __ \u03c1 , for all J, K \u2208 {A, B}, public goods provision is set equal to zero, i.e., gs = 0 for \ns \u2208 {0, 1}, the first-period tax on the ruling group is\n  t 1 \n J =   [L(\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01) + f(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41)] \u2212 \u03c41\u03b2 K y(\u03c01, \u03c3 K, w K  )      __________________________________\u03b2 J y(\u03c01, \u03c3 J, w J ) ,\n  and the second-period tax on the ruling group is\n  t 2 \n J = \u2212  \u03c42 \u03b2 K y(\u03c02, \u03c3 K, w K  )  _____________\u03b2 J y(\u03c02, \u03c3 J, w J  )  .\nBy part (i) a politically motivated government chooses the same property-rights protection as a \nutilitarian planner. The logic is similar: choosing less than full property-rights protection would \nmean throwing away resources that could be taxed to provide public goods or redistributive \ntransfers (see below).11 As will be clear in Section IV, however, the efficient use of legal capacity \n11 Besley and Persson (2007, sect. 5.3) develops an example when the production-efficiency result fails to hold. It \nextends the basic framework studied here with a labor market, which generates untaxed quasi-rents. If political insti-\ntutions are noninclusive and fiscal capacity is low, the government representing group J may then have incentive to \nexclude group K from the full utilization of available legal capacity, so as to preserve high rents due to a supply of cheap \nSEpTEmBER 20091228 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\nin each period certainly does not imply that every society will have high levels of property-rights \nprotection, as these depend directly on investments in legal capacity.\nPart (ii) is a close cousin of the result in Proposition 1 (ii) and the formal argument uses \nthe same steps. The important difference is that a government representing group J compares \nthe value of public goods with the value of transfers to its own group, which are worth  \n__ \u03c1 > 1. \nAs a result of this, public goods are provided in fewer states of the world (or no states at all, \nif  \n__ \u03c1 <  __ \u03b1).\nIn the redistributive states of the world, \u03b1s <  __ \u03c1 , the difference with the utilitarian benchmark \nis more stark.12 To derive this result in part (iii) formally, substitute the government budget con-\nstraints into the objective (8) and take the derivative with respect to each tax rate. Because the \nresulting derivatives are constant, it is optimal to choose the corner solutions described in part \n(iii). The result makes intuitive sense. As the ruling group overvalues its own welfare and $1 \nworth of public goods is less valuable than $1 of private income when \u03b1s <  __ \u03c1 , it finds it optimal \nto provide no public goods and set a maximal tax on the nonruling group to finance a transfer \nto itself. In period 1, this transfer is smaller to the extent that public revenues are set aside for \nfinancing improvements in state capacity. Note that fiscal capacity is less than fully utilized in \nthis case.13\nTogether, Propositions 1 and 2 reveal exactly how political control with  \n__ \u03c1 >  __ \u03c1 distorts policy \noutcomes, compared to a utilitarian outcome. Political control implies a taxation distortion: in \nredistributive states of the world, one group always pays maximal taxes to fund redistribution, \nwhereas the utilitarian criterion does not favor such redistribution. It also implies a public goods \ndistortion: common-interest states of the world are too few, as public goods are not provided, \neven though they are socially valuable by the utilitarian criterion, if \u03b1s \u2265 1. From an ex ante per-\nspective, public goods are not provided with probability H( __ \u03c1) compared to H(1) in the utilitarian \ncase. The size of the public goods distortion depends on the inclusiveness of political institutions. \nIf  \n__ \u03c1 is very large, or public goods not very valuable (war is unlikely) so the distribution of \u03b1 \nis skewed to the left, we will observe mainly a redistributive rather than a common interest \nstate.\nIII. Investments in State Capacity\nHaving established the structure of optimal policy, the next task is to study investments in \nlegal and fiscal capacity in period 1.\nA. Optimal Investment decisions\nTo characterize these investments, we need some preliminaries and notation. Assume that \ngroup J holds power in period 1. At this point, the governing group faces uncertainty over the \nperiod 2 realization of \u03b1 as well as government identity. Drawing on the results in Propositions \nlabor for group J\u2019s investment projects. But when fiscal capacity is above a certain level, the incentive to boost quasi-\nrents goes away. This is a further application of Diamond and Mirrlees's (1971) insights: when powers to tax are suf-\nficient, it is always optimal for the ruling group to maximize national income and use the tax system to redistribute it.\n12 One clean, although somewhat unrealistic, feature of the model is a dramatic change in policy even if  \n__ \u03c1 is only \nslightly below one. A model with some curvature in the utility function would yield a more continuous deviation from \nthe utilitarian benchmark.\n13 We are assuming that fiscal capacity does not affect the size of the income transfer that can be made to group J \n(other than through its effects on the maximal taxes that can be raised from group K ).\nVOL. 99 NO. 4 1229BESLEy ANd pERSSON: ORIgINS Of STATE cApAcITy\n1\u20132 and going through some algebra, the Appendix shows that we can write the expected payoff \nto group J as a function of the two forms of state capacity:\n(9)  W J(\u03c42, \u03c02) = (1 \u2212 \u03c42 )[  __ \u03c1 \u03b2  J y(\u03c02, \u03c3 J, w J  ) +  __ \u03c1\u03b2 K y(\u03c02, \u03c3 K, w K )]\n + \u03c42 {([1 \u2212 H( __ \u03c1)] E(\u03b12 | \u03b12 \u2265  __ \u03c1)\n + H( __ \u03c1)[\u03b3  J  __ \u03c1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b3  J  )  __ \u03c1])[\u03b2 J y(\u03c02, \u03c3 J, w J  ) + \u03b2 K y(\u03c02, \u03c3 K, w K  )]} .\nWe can then state the optimal investment decision in state capacity as the maximization of\n W  J(\u03c42, \u03c02) \u2212 \u03bb(\u03b11)[L(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41) + f(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41)] ,\nwhere \u03bb(\u03b11) = max  {\u03b11,  __ \u03c1 } is the realized (marginal) cost of public funds in period 1. To help \ncharacterize the solution, we define two more parameters. The first is the net expected (marginal) \nvalue of public funds in period 2 for group J:\n(10)  \u03bb 2  J = [1 \u2212 H( __ \u03c1)]E(\u03b12 | \u03b12 \u2265  __ \u03c1) + H( __ \u03c1)[(\u03b3 J \u2212 \u03c9 J  )( __ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1)] ,\nwhere \u03c9 J = \u03c3 J w  J\u03b2  J\/\u03a9, \u03c9K = \u03c3 K  w K\u03b2  K\/\u03a9 are the shares of the two groups in total pledge-\nable wealth held by agents with high-return projects, \u03a9 = [\u03c3 A  w A\u03b2  A + \u03c3 B  w B\u03b2 B   ], and where we \nhave used the adding-up constraints \u03b3  J + \u03b3  K = 1 and \u03c9 J + \u03c9 K = 1. Note that \u03c9  J and \u03c9K reflect \neach group\u2019s economic power, in terms of investment opportunities. The first term in  \u03bb 2 J reflects \nthe expected value of public goods in common interest-states of the world, whereas the second \nreflects the expected value of transfers to J less expected taxes paid by J in redistributive states \nof the world. We also define the net expected (marginal) value of private funds to high-return \ngroup J agents in period as\n(11) \u03c1J =  __ \u03c1 + \u03c9 J( __ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1) .\nThis is an average of  \n__ \u03c1 and  __ \u03c1 with weights reflecting the share of the wealth of the high-return \ninvestment agents in group J.\nAssuming that there exists sufficient inherited fiscal capacity to fund investments at the desired \nlevel, the first-order conditions for investing in state capacity can be written as\n(12)  (\u03c1J + \u03c42  \u03bb 2 J)(rH \u2212 rL ) \u03a9 \u22dc \u03bb(\u03b11)L\u03c0(\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01)\n c.s. \u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01 \u2265 0\nand\n(13)  \u03bb 2 J [(1 + \u03c02)(rH \u2212 rL ) \u03a9 + rL(\u03b2 Jw  J + \u03b2K  w K)] \u22dc \u03bb(\u03b11)f\u03c4(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41)\n c.s. \u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41 \u2265 0 .\nConditions (12) and (13) summarize all the forces that shape investment in state capacity.\nSEpTEmBER 20091230 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\nBefore exploring in detail the implications of (12) and (13) for observable outcomes, we state \na basic result:\nPROPOSITION 3: \n (i) In the utilitarian case ( __ \u03c1 =  __ \u03c1 = 1), there is always investment in both types of state \ncapacity.\n (ii) With political control ( __ \u03c1 > 1 >  __ \u03c1), a necessary and sufficient condition for both groups \nto invest in both types of state capacity is\n  \u03bb 2 J > 0, for J = A, B.\n  If this condition does not hold, then at most one group invests in fiscal capacity.\nClearly, if  \u03bb 2 J > 0, the left-hand sides of both (12) and (13) are positive and group J values \nimprovements in both kinds of state capacity. In the utilitarian case, this is always the case:  \u03bb 2 J\ndefined in (10) has a positive first term because public goods are always provided in some states \n(because  __ \u03b1 > 1), while the second term in (10) is zero because a utilitarian decision maker has \nno intrinsic demand for redistribution.\nWith political control, the sign of  \u03bb 2 J is no longer certain. But we can find alternative sufficient \nconditions for positive investments. One is that public goods are valuable enough, so the first \nterm in  \u03bb 2 J is large enough to outweigh any negative second term due to expected redistribution \naway from group J. Another is that political stability is high enough, so that \u03b3 J \u2212 \u03c9  J > 0 making \nthe second term always positive, guaranteeing expected redistributive benefits in addition to any \nbenefits from public goods. More generally, if economic power and political power are broadly \nin line with one another, i.e., \u03b3  J \u2248 \u03c9 J, then we are likely to have  \u03bb 2 J > 0.\nHowever, there are parameter values for which neither group has any incentive to invest in fis-\ncal capacity. Assume that the political regime is very unrepresentative, such that  \n__ \u03c1 >  __ \u03b1 > 1 and \npublic goods are not provided in any state of the world. If the political regime is also very unsta-\nble such that \u03b3 J < \u03c9 J, J = A, B, both groups fear to be expropriated often enough that  \u03bb 2 J < 0. \nThen, none of them invests at all in fiscal capacity, although one or both may still invest in legal \ncapacity. In this case, the political outcome leads to underinvestment in the state compared to the \nutilitarian benchmark. In welfare terms, the state is investing too little in fiscal capacity and then \nusing that capacity for redistribution rather than public goods provision.\nIf  \u03bb 2 J > 0 holds for both groups J \u2208 {A, B}, the left-hand side of (12) is increasing in \u03c42 and \nthe left-hand side of (13) is increasing in \u03c02. Then, investments in legal and fiscal capacity are \ncomplements. As a result, the demand for fiscal capacity\u2014to finance redistribution or public \ngoods\u2014is greater when the economy is more productive, as a given increment of taxation raises \nmore revenues due to a larger tax base. Equally, having larger fiscal capacity gives an extra boost \nto the demand for legal capacity to support markets, because it gives additional public funds that \ncan be used productively. This complementarity is of genuine economic interest and corresponds \nto a situation in which common interests in state development are important.\nTherefore, from now on we focus on the case where  \u03bb 2 J > 0 for both groups. This will be true \nas long as there are sufficient common interests, i.e., the probability that \u03b12 is greater than  __ \u03c1 is \nlarge enough.\nFinally, note that if  \u03bb 2 J > 0, we may have overinvestment as well as underinvestment in state \ncapacity relative to the utilitarian benchmark. From (12) and (13) and supermodularity\u2014see \nbelow\u2014a sufficient condition for overinvestment is that both  \u03bb 2 J and \u03c1 J are increasing in  __ \u03c1 \nVOL. 99 NO. 4 1231BESLEy ANd pERSSON: ORIgINS Of STATE cApAcITy\n evaluated at  \n__ \u03c1 = 1. Taking the derivatives of  \u03bb 2 J and \u03c1J and imposing the constraint \u03b2 J __ \u03c1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2 J) __ \u03c1 = 1, we obtain the following two conditions: \u2202  \u03bb 2 J\/\u2202  __ \u03c1 = H(1)(\u03b3 J \u2212 \u03c9 J  ) \u2212 h(1)(1 \u2212 \u03b2 J  ) > 0 and \u2202\u03c1J\/\u2202  __ \u03c1 = (\u03c9 J \u2212 \u03b2 J )\/(1 \u2212 \u03b2 J  ) > 0. Roughly speaking, overinvestment emerges with \ngroup J in power when the expected gains from redistribution to the group are large enough to \noutweigh the expected losses from less public goods provision (the condition on \u2202 \u03bb 2 J\/\u2202  __ \u03c1) and, \nat the same time, the group\u2019s share in productive wealth is no smaller than its population share \n(the condition on \u2202\u03c1J\/\u2202  __ \u03c1).\nB. determinants of State capacity\nWhat does the model say about the various determinants of investment in state capacity? In a \nfirst step, we prove a set of results (in Propositions 4\u20137) that hold under general  conditions and \nregardless of which group is in power. This is because, with complementarity between invest-\nments, the payoff functions are supermodular and we can exploit results on monotone compara-\ntive statics: any factor that raises the value of the left-hand side of both (12) or (13) will raise \ninvestments in both forms of state capacity.14 More formally, suppose that we write an objective \nfunction in \u201creduced form\u201d as f (\u03c42, \u03c02; m) for relevant \u201cparameters\u201d m, and suppose that f ( \u00b7 ) is \nsupermodular in (\u03c42, \u03c02). Then (\u03c42, \u03c02) is monotonically increasing in m if \u22022  f ( \u00b7 )\/\u2202\u03c42\u2202m \u2265 0 \nand \u22022f ( \u00b7 )\/\u2202\u03c02\u2202m \u2265 0. This is exactly the condition that a change in a certain parameter raises \nthe left-hand side of both (12) and (13).\nIn a second step (Proposition 8), we derive more specific results on how the distribution of \neconomic power (wealth) affects institution building. This requires some additional regularity \nconditions.\nWe start with findings about wealth and the gains from trade:\nPROPOSITION 4: countries with higher wealth, as measured by \u03a9, optimally choose larger \nstate capacity of both kinds. Larger gains from trade in markets, as measured by higher \u03c3 A,\u03c3 B, \nor (rH \u2212 rL ), also raise investment in both fiscal and legal capacity.\nThis proposition says that richer countries will choose to have greater state capacity. Indeed, \nthe marginal benefit to investing in fiscal capacity is given by the size of national income; the \nterm (1 + \u03c02)(rH \u2212 rL )\u03a9 + rL(\u03b2 J w J + \u03b2 K  w K ) in (13) is equal to y2. And, the marginal benefit \nof investing in legal capacity is proportional to the marginal benefit of better property rights, the \nterm (rH \u2212 rL )\u03a9 in (12). Note that Proposition 4 applies, even if higher wealth or better trading \nopportunities accrue exclusively to the group that is not in power. This is because taxes finance \npublic goods and this creates a common interest in investing even if  __ \u03c1 = 0.\nThe results in Proposition 4 are consistent with the observation in Figure 1 that taxation and \nfinancial development are positively correlated with income both across and within countries. \nHowever, the causation runs from income to markets rather than the other way round.\nThe results are also consistent with the argument by Rajan and Zingales (2003) that finan-\ncial development is positively correlated with openness to international trade, because the latter \nexpands the returns to reallocating capital. These authors present historical evidence that finan-\ncial development and openness have co-varied, both being high in the period before World War I, \nlow in the interwar period and immediately after World War II, and then higher again in the last \n14 See Theorems 5 and 6 in Paul Milgrom and Chris Shannon (1994). This result is originally due to Topkis\u2014and \nhas been generalized in Milgrom and Shannon (1994) Theorem 4. \nSEpTEmBER 20091232 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\n30\u201340 years.15 We return to the relationship between financial development and income (growth) \nin Section IIIC below.\nWe next explore how demand for public goods affects the incentive to invest.\nPROPOSITION 5: A higher expected demand for public goods, a first-order stochastically dom-\ninating shift in a, raises  \u03bb 2  J and thereby investment in state capacity. Investments in fiscal and \nlegal capacity are decreasing in \u03bb(\u03b11).\nThe first result can be used to makes sense of Tilly\u2019s hypothesis on the historical importance \nof war in building fiscal capacity in Europe, with an auxiliary prediction for legal capacity. \nThe proposition is also consistent with the argument by development scholars, such as Jeffrey \nI. Herbst (1990) and Robert H. Bates (2001), that one reason for the weak states in Africa is the \npaucity of external conflict. However, the result applies more widely to any public goods that \nare national in character, such as broad-based health care programs or building a welfare state. \nIf the demand for such public goods or services is expected to be high, there is a large incentive \nto invest in state capacity, as these are common-interest investments. But such investments have \nto be financed. This effect is represented in the parameter \u03bb(\u03b11). When the period 1 demand for \npublic goods is great, public funds are at a premium and investments are lower. The greatest \nincentive to invest arises when \u03bb(\u03b11) =  __ \u03c1 , i.e., when period 1 taxes are used for redistribution.\nThe next result concerns the impact of political turnover.\nPROPOSITION 6: greater political stability, represented by an increase in \u03b3  J, increases  \u03bb 2  J and \nthereby investment in state capacity.\nTo see this, observe that\n  \n\u2202  \u03bb 2  J  ____\u2202\u03b3 J  = H( \n__ \u03c1)(  __ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1) \u2265 0,\ni.e., a higher probability of group J remaining in power (lower turnover) raises the group\u2019s \nexpected value of public funds in the future. Intuitively, the risk is smaller that the investing \ngroup J will see group K use the state for redistributive purposes against group J\u2019s interest in the \nfuture. This effect is also lower if  \n__ \u03c1 \u2212  _ \u03c1 is close to zero. As mentioned before, we can interpret \nthis gap between the weights the political process places on the ruling group and the nonruling \ngroup as a less representative political system offering less minority protection.\nThe model thus suggests that an interesting \u201cinteraction\u201d term should be found in the data\u2014\nwe should observe more developed economic institutions in politically stable countries, and this \npositive effect should be particularly large in less representative political systems with little pro-\ntection of minorities. We know of no systematic empirical evidence on this issue.16\nHowever, a good illustrative historical case study for how political stability can shape invest-\nment in state capacity in a nondemocratic political system comes from England after the Glorious \nRevolution in 1688. This led to the political dominance of the Whigs in Parliament between \n15 Rajan and Zingales\u2019s informal theory emphasizes the rent-protection incentives of incumbents, which do not \nappear in our basic model. A similar point arises in Besley and Persson (2007, sect. 5.3).\n16 Alberto Alesina, Reza Baqir, and William Easterly (1999) have emphasized how ethnically divided communi-\nties spend less on public goods. If we were to interpret  \n__ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1 as a measure of ethnic divisions, their finding would \nbe predicted by our model, the probability of no public-goods provision is given by H( __ \u03c1). But our model would have \nthe additional prediction that such divisions interact with political instability to curtail investments in legal and fiscal \ncapacity. \nVOL. 99 NO. 4 1233BESLEy ANd pERSSON: ORIgINS Of STATE cApAcITy\n1715 and 1759 (see David Stasavage 2007, table 1). Peter Mathias and O\u2019Brien (1976) calculate \nthat taxes as a share of GDP rose from 16 percent to 20 percent over this period. Moreover, the \nadministrative institutions put in place during the same period meant that, after 1713, excises \nand indirect taxes levied on domestically produced goods and services accounted for more than \nthree quarters of tax revenues (O\u2019Brien 2005). The considerable investment in state capacity by \nthis dominant elite, culminating in the introduction of an income tax, underpinned the fiscal \nsuperiority of the British over the French during the Napoleonic wars and assisted Britain to \nraise public debt credibly to fight those wars. In the years 1803 to 1812, the British government \nhad accumulated sufficient fiscal capacity to raise taxes equal to a remarkable 36 percent of GDP \n(Mathias and O\u2019Brien 1976).\nIn addition to this interaction effect, we are interested in the direct effect of the representative-\nness of political regimes. To get at this, consider the effect of rasing  \n__ \u03c1 , subject to the constraint \n\u03b2 J   __ \u03c1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2 J  )  __ \u03c1 = 1. In general, this effect is quite complicated, interacting with the distribu-\ntion of political power as represented by \u03b3 J and economic power as represented by \u03c9 J. We can \nneutralize these effects by supposing that \u03b2 J = \u03c9 J = \u03b3 J. While the assumption \u03b3 J = \u03b2 J says that \npolitical power is allocated (probabilistically) in proportion to population size, \u03b2 J = \u03c9 J implies \nthat \u03c3 J w  J is the same in both groups, i.e., they have the same opportunities to invest. We then \nhave:\nPROPOSITION 7: If \u03b2 J \u2248 \u03c9 J \u2248 \u03b3  J, a more representative political system, in the sense of a \nlower  \n__ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1, raises investment in both fiscal and legal capacity.\nTo see this, observe that with \u03b2 J = \u03c9 J = \u03b3  J and the constraint \u03b2 J  __ \u03c1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2 J )  __ \u03c1 = 1, \nthen \u03c1J = 1 and the second term in the expression for  \u03bb 2  J in (10) is zero, so  \u03bb 2  J=  \u222b __ \u03c1  __ \u03b1   \u03b12 dH(\u03b1), which is independent of J. The effect of an increase in  __ \u03c1 on \u03c1J is therefore zero, \nwhile the effect on  \u03bb 2  J is\n  \n\u2202  \u03bb 2  J ____\u2202  __ \u03c1   = \u2212 h( \n__ \u03c1)  __ \u03c1 < 0.\nSo the marginal return to both fiscal and legal capacity increases for lower  \n__ \u03c1 . By continuity, the \nresult holds for small differences between \u03b2 J, \u03c9 J, and \u03b3 J.\nIntuitively, more representativeness and minority protection lowers the value of redistribution, \nand therefore public goods are supplied more often. As the state becomes more about common \ninterests, the value of fiscal capacity increases and, by complementarity, so does the value of \nlegal capacity. To see why this result requires the condition \u03b2 J \u2248 \u03c9 J \u2248 \u03b3 J, suppose, for example, \nthat the ruling group has \u03b3  J > \u03c9 J. Then, a less representative political system can increase the \nvalue of future revenue  \u03bb 2  J since that group\u2019s political power (in an expected sense) is greater than \nits cost of taxation (proportional to \u03c9 J  ).\nA long tradition in political science (for example, Arend Lijphart 1999)  considers proportional \nelectoral systems more consensual than majoritarian systems, while Persson, Gerard Roland, and \nTabellini (2000) argue that parliamentary democracies are more representative than presidential \ndemocracies. In these interpretations, Proposition 7 predicts that we should see more investment \nin legal and fiscal capacity in such democracies, which appears consistent with the findings in \nPersson and Tabellini (2004) that parliamentary and proportional democracies have much higher \ngovernment spending. The comparative static in Proposition 7 also captures the idea that states \nwith greater checks and balances are likely to have more state capacity. This parallels the argu-\nment of Kenneth A. Schultz and Barry Weingast (2003), who suggest that greater checks and \nbalances in British political arrangements facilitated revenue raising. Thomas J. Sargent and \nSEpTEmBER 20091234 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\nFrancois R. Velde (1995) argue that France\u2019s desire to constrain the king\u2019s revenues resulting \nin an underdeveloped fiscal system played a central role in the economic events leading to the \nFrench Revolution.\nFinally, we would like to say something specific about the distribution of economic power \nand investments in state capacity. To do this, we simplify the model \u03c3  A = \u03c3  B. We then look at \nthe effect of a higher share of wealth in the hands of group J, i.e., an increase in \u03c9 J holding total \nwealth ( \u03b2 J w J + \u03b2 K w K ) fixed. With a few additional regulatory conditions, we obtain:\nPROPOSITION 8: Under Assumption 1 ( see the Appendix), greater economic power of the rul-\ning group, i.e., a higher value of \u03c9 J, increases investment in legal capacity and reduces invest-\nment in fiscal capacity.\nPROOF:\nSee the Appendix.\nThe argument is straightforward. An increase in \u03c9 J raises \u03c1 J but reduces  \u03bb 2  J, which\u2014in turn\u2014\nraises the marginal return to legal capacity but reduces the marginal return to fiscal capacity. \nAssumption 1 essentially guarantees that the direct effects on the marginal returns to fiscal and \nlegal capacity are not offset by indirect effects operating through the complementarity. The com-\nparative statics then go in the expected direction, i.e., according to the change in the marginal \nbenefits of the two types of state capacity.\nProposition 8 speaks to the wealth distribution between the groups in and out of power. It sug-\ngests that, ceteris paribus, a more unequal income distribution raises investments in legal capac-\nity and cuts investments in fiscal capacity if the rich have a hold on political power, whereas the \neffects go the other way if the poor have political power. Because the effect of \u03c9 J on \u03c1 J is larger \nthe higher is  \n__ \u03c1 , this effect should be most pronounced in autocracies. In other words, the model \npredicts the protection of property rights to improve (deteriorate) and taxation to fall (rise) as \nincome inequality becomes more pronounced in autocracies ruled by rich elites (poor masses).\nTogether, Propositions 4\u20138 give a fairly complete understanding of the forces that shape the \nincentives to invest in state capacity.\nC. Implications for Economic growth\nThe simple structure of the model makes it easy to state the implications for economic growth, \ndefined as the proportional increase in national income from period 1 to period 2. Using the ear-\nlier definition of per capita income and the results in Proposition 1, a little algebra establishes\n  \ny2 \u2212 y1 ______\ny1\n   =    (\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01)(rH \u2212 rL ) \u03a9   __________________________ \n (1 + \u03c01)(rH \u2212 rL ) \u03a9 + rL  \u2211 J    \u03b2 J w J  .\nEvidently, the growth rate is directly proportional to the investments in legal capacity. Since \nthere is no private accumulation, higher growth comes about solely by better allocative efficiency \nfacilitating gains from trade\u2014achieving higher TFP. Thus, there are strong reasons to see a posi-\ntive correlation between improvements of market-supporting economic institutions and income \ngrowth.\nLegal capacity in our model is closely related to financial development: the amount of private \ncredit is proportional to \u03c0. As noted in Section IC, many empirical studies have measured finan-\ncial development precisely in this way and found it to be positively correlated with growth of \nVOL. 99 NO. 4 1235BESLEy ANd pERSSON: ORIgINS Of STATE cApAcITy\nGDP per capita. According to our model, financial deepening can indeed cause growth. But the \nrelationship can easily go the other way. As we have seen in Proposition 4, higher income gener-\nally raises the incentives to invest in legal capacity leading to financial deepening.\nIn terms of fiscal institutions, taxation, and growth, the complementarity between fiscal and \nlegal capacity delivers clear-cut results. If greater legal capacity is driven by any of the determi-\nnants emphasized in Propositions 4\u20137, we expect it go hand in hand with higher fiscal capacity. \nVariation in these forces would lead us to observe a positive correlation between higher taxes \nand faster growth. On the other hand, higher legal capacity driven by a more unequal income \ndistribution, as in Proposition 8, could induce a negative correlation between fiscal capacity \nand growth. Finally, in the case when  \u03bb 2  J < 0 (so that there is no investment in fiscal capacity), \nlegal capacity and national income are still positively correlated, while there is zero correlation \nbetween taxation and growth.\nThese theoretical findings are interesting in relation to some of the empirical findings in the \nmacro literature on growth and development. Many researchers have found a positive correla-\ntion between measures of financial development, or property-rights protection, and economic \ngrowth (see for example, Robert G. King and Ross Levine 1993, Robert E. Hall and Charles \nI. Jones 1999, and a number of subsequent papers). The discussion above cautions us that such \ncorrelations may indeed reflect a two-way relationship. On the other hand, those expecting to \nfind a negative relation between taxes and growth have basically come up empty-handed (see, \nfor example, the overview in Roland B\u00e9nabou 1996). Simple though it is, our model suggest a \npossible reason for these findings.\nOur results are obtained in the absence of private capital accumulation. Besley and Persson \n(2007,  sect. VD) extends the same framework to include private investments. In that setting, \nbuilding fiscal capacity has an additional \u201cstandard\u201d disincentive effect on growth because a \nhigher value of \u03c42 increases future expected taxes and lowers the marginal expected return to \ninvesting, thereby reducing capital accumulation. However, building legal capacity now has an \nadditional positive effect on growth, because it raises the (gross) returns on private investment \nwhich stimulates private accumulation. As long as the complementarity between fiscal and \nlegal capacity holds, the increases in both kinds of state capacity expand together with private \nincomes.\nIV. A Look at the Data\nOur model predicts that fiscal systems and market-supporting legal institutions (particularly \nthose fostering financial development) are jointly endogenous to a common set of economic, \npolitical, and social variables. In this section, we take a preliminary look at data on measures \nof financial development, contract enforcement, and tax structure. We explore some conditional \ncorrelations between these outcome variables and the determinants suggested by our model, but \ndo not make any claims of capturing causal relations.\nA. Independent Variables\nAs common determinants of the state capacity outcomes, we include three sets of indepen-\ndent variables. We hypothesize that the historical incidence of war serves as a proxy for the \npast demand for common public goods, g. Then, the model has the nontrivial implication that \nthis proxy should be correlated with both forms of state capacity today. We use data from the \nCorrelates of War database to create a measure of how large a share of the years between 1816, or \nSEpTEmBER 20091236 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\nthe year of independence (if later), and 1975 that a country was involved in an external military \nconflict.17\nWe also include some measures of political institutions. The theory predicts that the inclu-\nsiveness of political institutions is one of the key factors shaping investments in state capacity. \nAs in the case of war, we should thus consider the incidence of inclusive institutions in the past. \nAccordingly, we measure the share of years from 1800 (or independence) to 1975 that a country \nwas democratic (as defined by a strictly positive value of the polity2 variable in the Polity IV \ndataset).18 Given the discussion in Section III of differences across democratic institutions, we \nalso measure the share of years the country was a parliamentary democracy.\nFurther, our specification for each outcome variable includes a set of indicators for legal ori-\ngins, as in many recent studies of institutions following La Porta et al. (1998). As mentioned \nabove, our model suggests a theoretical role for legal origins via the cost function L( \u00b7 ). If some \nlegal origins affect the ease with which contracting can be done, we would expect this to affect \ninvestments in legal capacity. Perhaps less trivially, we would also expect the same legal origins \nto affect investments in tax systems in the same direction through the basic complementarity \nbetween the two forms of state capacity.\nFinally, we do not include income, income per capita, or other measures of development \namong the independent variables. According to our model, independent shocks to income can \ncertainly affect investments in both forms of state capacity. But the analysis also clearly shows \nthat state capacity helps determine income. Disentangling this two-way relation requires a more \nsophisticated empirical strategy than the one pursued here.\nB. Legal capacity\nTable 1 considers legal capacity, measured by financial development and contract enforce-\nment, as the dependent variable. The first column reports results for a common measure of finan-\ncial development in the literature beginning with King and Levine (1993), namely the private \ncredit to GDP ratio.19 We take the average of this variable over all years from 1975 onward. As \nall other outcome variables in Tables 1 and 2, this measure is scaled to lie between zero and one, \nwith higher values indicating a greater level of state capacity. An increase in the proportion of \nyears up to 1975 that a country has been in an external conflict is strongly positively correlated \nwith this measure of financial development. Democracy does not seem to matter in a signifi-\ncant way. Interestingly, German and Scandinavian legal origins are positively correlated with \nprivate credit, but English and Socialist legal origin are not (French legal origin is the excluded \ncategory).20\nColumn 2 looks at the country\u2019s rank in terms of access to credit, using the indicators from \nthe World Bank\u2019s doing Business Web site.21 Again, our incidence-of-war variable is positively \n17 http:\/\/www.correlatesofwar.org\/. Specifically, we say that a country is at war in a specific year if either (or both) \nof the binary (0,1) variables interstatewar or extrastatewar\u2014which both refer to external conflicts\u2014is equal to unity. \nThe mean of the resulting variable is 0.03 with a standard deviation of 0.73. The results in Tables 1 and 2 are robust to \nusing different lags for this variable, including the average years of war up to 1900. The results also hold up if we use a \ndummy variable denoting whether a state has been involved in any external conflict before 1975, which guards against \nthe influence of such outliers as France and Britain.\n18 http:\/\/www.cidcm.umd.edu\/polity\/.\n19 We thank Giovanni Favara for providing these data.\n20 Some of these correlations, in particular that between wars and state capacity, are weaker if we look only at \nwithin-region variation, i.e., by including a full set of regional dummies (for eight regions) in the regressions. Thus, it \nappears that the different war histories of Western Europe and regions like Africa drive this correlation (cf. the remarks \nin connection with Proposition 5).\n21 http:\/\/www.doingbusiness.org. The overall ranking is put together from four subcomponents: (i) a Legal Rights \nIndex, which measures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws facilitate lending, (ii) a Credit Information \nVOL. 99 NO. 4 1237BESLEy ANd pERSSON: ORIgINS Of STATE cApAcITy\n correlated with legal capacity. Parliamentary democracy is also significantly correlated with \nhigher legal capacity according to this measure (the sum of the two democracy variables is \nsignificantly different from zero). As in column 1, German and Scandinavian legal origin are \npositively correlated with the outcome. Column 3 uses another variable from the doing Business \nindicators, the country\u2019s rank in terms of investor protection.22 The findings here are somewhat \ndifferent in that war experience does not seem to matter while being a parliamentary democracy \ndoes. In addition, it is English, as opposed to German or Scandinavian, legal origin that is cor-\nrelated with investor protection.\nFinally, we use a perceptions index of government antidiversion policies from the International \nCountry Risk Guide (ICRG), which itself is the sum of five different indexes, including contract \nenforcement and the rule of law. This index has been extensively used in the macro develop-\nment literature (for example, Hall and Jones 1999; Acemoglu, Johnson, and James A. Robinson \n2001), as a measure of the protection of property rights. We take the average of this index from \nthe early 1980s to the late 1990s. Even though the source of this variable is quite different from \nthe others, it tells the same basic story in terms of war experience, parliamentary democracy, \nand German and Scandinavian legal origins. To summarize, the patterns in the data are largely \nIndex, which measures rules affecting the scope, access, and quality of credit information, (iii) public credit registry \ncoverage, and (iv) private credit bureau coverage. See Simeon Djankov, Caralee McLeish, and Andrei Shelifer (2007) \nfor further details.\n22 http:\/\/www.doingbusiness.org\/. This ranking is assembled from four underlying indexes: (i) transparency of trans-\nactions (Extent of Disclosure Index), (ii) liability for self-dealing (Extent of Director Liability Index), (iii) sharehold-\ners\u2019 ability to sue officers and directors for misconduct (Ease of Shareholder Suit Index), and (iv) strength of Investor \nProtection Index (the average of the three index).

This aspect of state capacity is more \ndifficult to measure in terms of observable outcomes, since the model predicts that fiscal  capacity \nis not always fully utilized. What matters are the past investments that make it possible to raise \ntaxes. Governments in countries with little fiscal capacity tend to use border taxes, such as tar-\niffs, as the basis of their tax systems. They also tend to require less institutionalized structures of \ncompliance compared to income taxation.\nIn column 1 of Table 2, we use one minus the share of revenue from trade taxes as a first mea-\nsure of fiscal capacity. This measure is based on IMF data and is expressed as an average from \n1975 onward.24 As predicted by the model, countries with a history of war are less reliant on \n23 These findings are also consistent with wars directly stimulating financial systems through public debt issue. Of \ncourse, this is not inconsistent with our general argument and ideas. Indeed, a public debt channel would reinforce \nthe general complementarities that we have identified. However, it is another channel for war to have an impact on \nfinancial development. That being said, introducing more public debt would not necessarily lead to better private con-\ntract enforcement and more private credit (in theory) except as an unintended consequence of public sector financial \ndevelopment.\n24 We thank Mick Keen for making the data on the structure of taxation used in Thomas Baunsgaard and Michael \nKeen (2005) available to us.

German and Scandinavian legal origins are also correlated with greater fiscal capac-\nity measured in this way. In column 2, we add indirect taxation and find similar results.\nIn column 3, we measure high fiscal capacity by an extensive income tax system, using the \nincome tax to GDP ratio as our outcome measure. Again, we find past wars and German and \nScandinavian legal origin to correlate positively with high fiscal capacity. In addition, past par-\nliamentary democracy is now correlated with fiscal capacity. Column 4 looks at overall taxes \nraised as a share of GDP, a \u201ccatch-all\u201d measure of fiscal capacity. This outcome shows a similar \npattern of correlations as the share of income taxes in GDP.\nD. Summary\nPutting the results in Tables 1 and 2 together, the historical incidence of war, the historical \nincidence of parliamentary democracy, and German and Scandinavian legal origins are remark-\nably stable predictors of both legal and fiscal capacity. The correlations we have uncovered are in \nline with the predictions of our model, where both forms of state capacity have common origins \nin political institutions, the need to finance common interest public goods, and factors that shape \nthe cost of investments. With the caveat made earlier, we also note that regressions of the same \nkind as those reported in Tables 1 and 2, but with income per capita as the dependent variable, \nproduce very similar patterns of sign and significance.\nEven though the preliminary evidence is encouraging, much remains to be done before we can \nclaim to have identified causal effects in line with the predictions of the theory. There are many \ncaveats. For example, in looking at the data over long time periods, there may be a survivorship bias \ntoward countries that appear in the data today. Related to this, one could also worry about whether \nthere is reverse causation between state capacity and war. In future work, it may be fruitful to \nexploit evidence from the time-series experience of countries that have built legal and fiscal capac-\nity to yield more convincing evidence, even if the set of countries with available data is limited.\nV. Concluding Comments\nThe historical experience of today\u2019s rich nations indicates that creation of state capacity to \ncollect taxes and enforce contracts is a key aspect of development. Equally, the current experi-\nence of today\u2019s poor nations indicates that state capacity cannot be taken for granted. We analyze \ninvestments in state capacity as purposeful decisions reflecting circumstance and institutional \nstructure. Our theoretical analysis highlights the factors that shape these decisions and points \nto a basic complementarity between fiscal and legal capacity. The analysis brings together ideas \nfrom economic history, finance, development economics, and political economics. A first inspec-\ntion of the data suggests that the common determinants proposed by our theory do indeed cor-\nrelate in the predicted way with various measures of legal capacity and fiscal capacity.\nWhile we take a first step in modeling the forces that shape state capacity, further theoretical \nwork is needed too. Studying the two-way relation between state capacity and development in \nthe data should rely on theoretical predictions from a full-fledged dynamic model. A dynamic \nmultiperiod model would also permit the study of some issues bypassed here, such as deprecia-\ntion of state capacity, time- or income-dependent costs of capacity, and short-run versus long-run \ndeterminants of accumulation. For example, we expect the complementarity between fiscal and \nlegal capacity to lead to long-run overaccumulation of both types of capacity.25\n25 Besley and Persson (2007, sect. 5.1) find such an overaccumulation result when they study a quasi\u2013steady state \nof a repeated model like the one in this paper, in which none of the groups has a further incentive to accumulate any \nform of state capacity.\nSEpTEmBER 20091240 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\nSince the model uncovers clear links from political institutions to state capacity, it would be \ninteresting to explore endogenous political change\u2014especially the emergence of democracy\u2014in \nour framework. Despite its broad scope, the paper deals only with one aspect of property rights, \nthe market supporting role of property rights emphasized by, e.g., Hernando de Soto (2000). \nOther parallel issues concern the development of property rights against predation by the state, \nas emphasized, for example, by Douglass C. North (1990). A more complete theory of state \ndevelopment would deal with both aspects of property rights and would understand the emer-\ngence of constraints on state capacity being abused.\nExternal conflict is certainly an important source of common-interest public goods, but it is \nunsatisfying to treat every external conflict as exogenous. Ideally, endogeneity of conflict should \nbe explored in a model of multiple interdependent governments, who all have the option of invest-\ning in state capacity. In line with recent work in the democratic peace literature, such as Bruce \nBueno de Mesquita et al. (1999), details of domestic institutions might then help determine the \npropensity to engage in foreign conflict.\nGiven the central role of common interests in state building in our model, it is also inter-\nesting to think of ways to make these interests endogenous. Many nations emphasize a sense \nof belonging that creates common interests, and foster them explicitly through education \nand public programs. It would be interesting to introduce this as purposive behavior in the \nmodel.\nRedistribution also plays an important role in our analysis. Internal conflicts such as civil wars \nreflect an extreme form of domestic redistributive conflict. Unlike external war, anticipated civil \nwars will therefore have detrimental effects on the incentive to build state capacity\u2014see Besley \nand Persson (2008) who take the incidence of civil war as given. More generally, we expect \nbuilding state capacity and the patterns of civil war and economic development to be jointly \ndetermined by initial historical conditions and basic economic and political factors. This is also \nan important topic for further research.\nEven in the rudimentary form developed here, we believe that our analysis offers a new per-\nspective on the institutional underpinnings of development. In particular, the state capacities that \nwe analyze typically evolve quite slowly. This may help to explain why historical patterns of \nprosperity are so highly persistent.\nAppendix\nA. private Optimal choices\nA member of group J can borrow in period s only by putting up a share,  c s \n J \u2264 1, of her wealth \nw J as collateral . Denoting the amount borrowed by  b s \nJ , incentive compatibility implies (see \nfurther below):\n(14)   b s  J \u2264  p s  J  c s  J w J.\nIn addition to the notation in the text, let ls denote the amount of lending provided by an indi-\nvidual, ks the amount invested in a project, and ns the amount withheld from taxation in the \ninformal sector; and let ds \u2208 {0, 1} be a binary indicator for default on any amount borrowed. \nSince preferences are linear in private consumption (net income), we can write the utility of an \nindividual in group J and period s as\n  v s \n J = \u03b1sgs + (1 \u2212  t s  J )(rI    k s  J \u2212 rs    b s J + rs   l s  J ) + ( t s  J \u2212 \u03c4s ) n s  J + rs( b s  J \u2212  p s  J  c s  J w J )  d s  J .\nVOL. 99 NO. 4 1241BESLEy ANd pERSSON: ORIgINS Of STATE cApAcITy\nThe second term on the right-hand side is the net after-tax return from projects cum capital mar-\nkets transactions; the third is the return to concealing income from tax in the informal sector; \nand the fourth is the net gain from defaulting on borrowing.\nConsider an individual choosing ( k s  J ,  b s  J ,  n s  J ,  c s  J ,  d s  J ,  l s  J ) \u2265 0, in period s subject to the wealth \nconstraint,  k s \n J +  l s  J \u2264 w J +  b s  J , the collateral constraint,  c s  J \u2264 1, and the tax avoidance constraint, \nn s \n J \u2264w J. It is immediate that any individual with an investment opportunity would find it optimal \nto borrow and invest a large amount, and then default on his debt, i.e., set  d s \n J = 1, as long as  b s  J >  p s  J  c s  J w J. This formally motivates the upper bound on borrowing in (14). Moreover, as long \nas taxes exceed the critical level  t s \n J > \u03c4s , it is optimal to set  n s  J = w J, i.e., put all projects in the \ninformal sector. This formally motivates the upper bound on the tax rate.\nImposing the no-tax-arbitrage and no-default constraints, the optimal choices for individu-\nals with different rates of return are simple to characterize. High-return individuals for whom \nrI \u2265 rs find it optimal to put up all their wealth as collateral,  c s  J = 1, invest a maximum amount \n k s \n J = (1 +  p s  J ) w J, and borrow  p s  J w J to enjoy the surplus of their project . Individuals with low \nreturns are happy to lend at any market rate rs \u2265 rL that makes up for their opportunity cost of \nforegone return. Putting this logic together yields equations (2) and (3) in the text.\nB. derivation of the Investment Objective\nExploiting Propositions 1\u20133, we can define in a straightforward way the payoffs to each group \ndepending on whether it has control over policy in period 2. If group J controls policy, its utility \nis\n(15)   w J  J (\u03b12, \u03c42, \u03c02 ) =  __ \u03c1\u03b2 J y(\u03c02, \u03c3 J, w J  ) +  __ \u03c1\u03b2 K y(\u03c02, \u03c3 K, w K ) + \n u \u03c42[(\u03b12 \u2212  __ \u03c1)\u03b2 J y(\u03c02, \u03c3 J, w J ) + (\u03b12 \u2212  __ \u03c1)\u03b2 K y(\u03c02, \u03c3 K, w K )] if \u03b12 \u2265  __ \u03c1\n \u03c42( __ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1)\u03b2 K y(\u03c02, \u03c3 K, w K ) if \u03b12 <  __ \u03c1 .\nSince this expression is increasing in both \u03c42 and \u03c02, the ruling group prefers access to greater \ntaxable and legal capacity, other things equal. The corresponding payoff to group J when the other \ngroup K controls policy, calculated by applying group J\u2019s own welfare weights, is as follows:\n(16)  w K   J (\u03b12, \u03c42, \u03c02) =  __ \u03c1 \u03b2 J y(\u03c02, \u03c3 J, w J  ) +  __ \u03c1\u03b2 K y(\u03c0s, \u03c3 K, w K ) + \n e \u03c42[(\u03b12 \u2212  __ \u03c1)\u03b2 J y(\u03c0s, \u03c3 J, w J ) + (\u03b12 \u2212  __ \u03c1)\u03b2 K y(\u03c0s, \u03c3 K, w K )] if \u03b12 \u2265  __ \u03c1\n \u03c42( __ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1)\u03b2 J y(\u03c0s, \u03c3 K, w K ) if \u03b12 <  __ \u03c1 .\nThese two expressions highlight a latent conflict of interest. When \u03b12 \u2265  __ \u03c1 , no such conflict \nexists and the groups in power and out of power both want better state fiscal and legal capacity. \nWhen \u03b12 <  __ \u03c1 , instead, the group out of power is worse off when \u03c42 is higher (cf. the negative \nterm ( __ \u03c1 \u2212  __ \u03c1) in the last term of (16)), because taxes are used to redistribute income away from \nthe nonruling group toward the ruling group. While there is an obvious conflict of interest over \nfiscal capacity in this case, both groups continue to value improvements in legal capacity.\nLet\u2019s assume that group J holds power in period 1. Define the expected payoff to this group \nwith economic institutions (\u03c42, \u03c02):\n W J(\u03c42, \u03c02) = \u03b3 J E { w J  J (\u03b12, \u03c42, \u03c02)} + (1 \u2212 \u03b3 J ) E { w K  J (\u03b12, \u03c42, \u03c02)} .\nSEpTEmBER 20091242 THE AmERIcAN EcONOmIc REVIEW\nUsing (15) and (16), it is straightforward to derive expected utility (over the realization of \u03b1) as \na function of \u03c42, \u03c02 to group J:\n W J(\u03c42, \u03c02 ) = (1 \u2212 \u03c42 )[  __ \u03c1 \u03b2 J y(\u03c02, \u03c3 J, w J ) +  __ \u03c1\u03b2 K y(\u03c02, \u03c3 K, w K )]\n [1 \u2212 H( __ \u03c1)] E(\u03b12 | \u03b12 \u2265  __ \u03c1) +\n + \u03c42 e H( __ \u03c1)[\u03b3 J   __ \u03c1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b3 J )  __ \u03c1] [ \u03b2 J y(\u03c02, \u03c3 J, w J ) + \u03b2K y(\u03c02, \u03c3 K, w K )] f .\nPROOF OF PROPOSITION 8:\nLet \u03c3 A = \u03c3 B = \u03c3 and state:\nASSUMPTION 1: for all interior solutions for (\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41) and (\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c01),\n  \nf\u03c4\u03c4 ___\nf\u03c4\n  >  H( \n__ \u03c1) _________  \n1 \u2212 \u03c42 H( __ \u03c1) and  \nL\u03c0\u03c0 ___\nL\u03c0\n   >   (rH \u2212 rL )\u03c3  \u03bb 2 \n J (1 \u2212 \u03c42H( __ \u03c1))    _______________________________    [(1 + \u03c02)(rH \u2212 rL )\u03c3 + rL ](\u03c1J + \u03c42  \u03bb 2  J  )H( __ \u03c1)   ,\nwhich will hold provided f\u03c4\u03c4  \/f\u03c4 and L\u03c0\u03c0  \/L\u03c0 are large enough.
