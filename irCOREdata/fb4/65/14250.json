The English\nand Welsh Further Education Funding Councils have contributed around \u00a32m to what\nbecame a \u00a35m five-year programme. The continuing emphasis of QUILT has been on the\n'learning' in information and learning technology.\nThis is a positioning paper; the QUILT programme provides a formative case study\nexample of funding targeted at all types of college staff. The paper illustrates the\ntraining and development methods used in the QUILT programme, analysing the\nprogramme's success during its first two full years of operation, and linking the\nsuccessful design of QUILT to other initiatives in the sector.\nThe QUILT model has influenced the form of the National Learning Network (NLN),\nas described elsewhere in this edition.

The NLN evaluation has a dedicated Website\n(http: \/\/www.shu.ac.uk\/n\/n) which is a useful and developing resource for those interested\nin the efficiency and effectiveness of learning technology. A version of this paper (with\nmore detailed statistics) is available there.\n67\nKevin Donovan and Daniel Atwere QUILT: a case study in the impact of a staff development programme\nIntroduction\nThe QUILT programme was designed and delivered on the basis of a major FE sector\nsurvey of 15,000 college staff and a series of consultation events during 1996. The survey\nresults were included in FEDA's submission for funding for the QUILT programme to the\nFEFC. The events, to which a senior manager and the member of staff responsible for IT\nin every sector college were invited, took place in every English region and in Wales. These-\nestablished training and other needs, the extent of technological readiness in colleges, and\npreferred training methods. QUILT was launched in Wales in 1996 and in England during\nthe following year. Its design has been adjusted to account for a follow-up survey in 1998\nand an impact study in 1999. Both of these (like the original survey report) were\nunpublished FEDA documents; data from them was used in internal reports to the FEFC\nand its Information and Learning Technology Committee (FEILTC). Other evidence for\nchange was provided by (for example) comments from delegates at events and from\nmembers of the FEILTC. Subsequent initiatives also accounted for adjustments to the\nprogramme to avoid duplication and to maximize synergy.\nThe QUILT programme in practice\nThe submission from FEDA approved by the Funding Councils covered seventeen\nactivities. These included training sessions, involving day and residential events ranging\nfrom ILT awareness to use of the Internet, the use of ILT in specific programme areas and\nWeb design. The events were attended by senior managers, tutors, technical and support\nstaff, some of whom were targeted with information on specific events. College governors\n(crucial for effective strategic development) have not attended in large numbers and a\nmultiple media training pack designed for them will be available soon. As colleges have run\nmore in-house training to match greater IT investment, the emphasis has been on specialist\nevents (eg Web and intranet design and ILT in programme areas).\nThe programme also offered consultancy on IT issues on a subsidized basis. Although this\ninitially did not meet with great demand, the recent requirement for colleges to produce\nconsidered ILT strategies in order to secure any NLN benefits has produced a number of\nrequests. Alongside this, the programme has offered publications (all referenced on the\nFEDA Website) in a range of media, including one FE CD containing resources and ideas\nfor ILT use, with free Internet access. Print publications have also been very popular. The\nILT Planning Handbook is out of print, but the others are still available including a Web\ndesign manual, which has sold in large numbers. Some of the publications (such as those\non ILT learning styles) are accompanied by free Internet-based resources such as\nPowerpoint slide sets. Information services supported the programme (originally a\nQUILTlink co-ordinator), answered sector queries by email and telephone and offered a\nplanning material exchange; this has been replaced by Web-based services.\nPerhaps the major achievement of the programme has been in supporting college-based\naction projects. Groups of colleges have received small amounts of money on a matched\nbasis to undertake developments in a range of ILT areas, such as key skills, intranet\ndevelopment and online tutoring. The project topics have reflected the move towards\ngreater use of distance and online methods, and the success of UK colleges in related staff\ntraining. The projects absorb one-third of the QUILT budget, which is returned directly to\n68\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\ncolleges for staff release. The report Websites and other material developed as part of the\nQUILT programme show the rich project outcomes, some of which are described below.\nQUILT quickly became part of the fabric of the further education sector, with excellent\ndemand for its activities. During a full year of the programme, fifty-five QUILT events\ninvolving 1,200 staff (including governors, principals, senior managers, curriculum staff\nand business support staff) were delivered, mainly in sector colleges. The first thirty-eight\nWelsh and English QUILT college-based action projects were completed, reported on the\nWebsite and disseminated via events and publications; a further twenty-four projects\n(mainly consortia) were started, developing staff in a range of ILT applications. A total of\n350 colleges and 2,000 senior managers were registered members of the QUILTlink\ninformation service, and received newsletters and remote support.\nAll colleges received QUILT event prospectuses and copies of QUILT newsletters. Over\n3,000 copies of the first QUILT publications were sold; all were translated into Welsh and\nmade available on the Website. Hundreds of hours of learning material provided by FENC\n(the Further Education National Consortium) covering a range of programme areas were\ntranslated into Welsh (and made accessible via the Internet) and the first QUILT CD was\nproduced.\nIn other work by FEDA staff, research on IT key skills and on learning with IT was\ncompleted and published. There was also an investigation into the IT-related accreditation\nroutes followed by college staff. Further research initiated an analysis of IT solutions for\nstudent tracking and tutorial support - vital issues in the promotion of 'lifelong learning'.\nCase studies on the efficiency and effectiveness of ILT were produced in nine colleges and\npublished on the Web, as one of FEDA's contributions to the Further Education Resources\nfor Learning (FERL) programme. These studies, which will be published on CD soon, are\nreferred to below. In an associated development the first two winners of the FEDA-\nsponsored Association of Colleges Beacon Award for the best college ILT staff\ndevelopment have exemplified strong senior management support and the involvement of\nstaff right across colleges.\nWhat has QUILT achieved?\nQUILT has been well received by the'FE sector. In many ways it has entered professional\nconsciousness with (for example) some colleges using the term 'QUILT' as a synonym for all\nIT activity or producing 'QUILT' newsletters. The programme has also received favourable\npress mention and references have appeared in ministerial and other official speeches.\nRespondents to the 1998 survey (an internal FEDA document, as noted above) expressed\nstrong satisfaction with all categories of QUILT activity. During 1999, the programme was\nrefocused. For example, a forthcoming CD, video and print material will help college\ngovernors with the crucial task of strategic planning for IT. Events have been concentrated\non higher-level activities such as Web skills and the development of standards for ILT\nmaterials. Some events are now located in an adult education college with residential\nfacilities. A large number of laptop computers were acquired for transport to and use in\ncolleges where most events take place. The outcomes of the development projects have\nbeen consolidated and disseminated, and reports of all completed projects are available via\nthe Website.\n69\nKevin Donovan and Daniel Atwere QUILT: a case study in the impact of a staff development programme\nQUILT in Wales illustrates a number of interesting aspects of ILT development, apart\nfrom the fact that the small number of colleges has allowed all to participate in events and\nprojects. Here, from the outset, all colleges benefited from access to JANET. The planning\nfor a 'digital college' in Wales has also involved elements from the QUILT programme. All\ncolleges have received free membership of NILTA as a result of FEDA intervention. The\nWales QUILT manager negotiated with FENC the provision of hours of learning material\nwhich has been translated into Welsh and made available via the Internet. An annual prize\nis offered for the best Welsh college Website.\nThe impact of QUILT by 1999 and in 2000\nAn impact study in 1999 (an internal FEDA document, unpublished to date) was based on\nsurveys of college staff who had used QUILT services and of those who had participated\nin QUILT projects. The extracts below concentrate on QUILT activities linked to events\nand college projects - at a time when QUILT was less than two years old in England and\nunder three in Wales. The study shows, for example, a growth in attendance at ILT events\nby respondents (less than 1 per cent in 1996; nearly 75 per cent in the last full year).\nIn responses about what they had gained from attending events, the most positive reactions\nincluded the following quotations:\n\u2022 Learning about new technologies and how they could be used further to enable and\nempower students in particular.\n\u2022 Case studies offering practical ideas, which can be applied to our own circumstances.\n\u2022 Enabled me to see the way forward in my own college.\n\u2022 The idea that we could do the same at our college.\n\u2022 The positive attitude and enthusiasm of the speakers.\n\u2022 Looking to the future, examining changing roles and advice on overcoming problems,\napathy and even hostility relating to ILT.\nThe most negative reactions (and an indication of the needs that the NLN would match)\nwere:\n\u2022 Not having time to examine and experiment with different technology as much as I\nwould have liked.\n\u2022 Difficulties of technical issues in relation to implementing ILT.\n\u2022 The feeling that my own limited resources would not be able to afford anything like the\nequipment on offer.\n\u2022 Not having definitive goals for progress - everything is changing so rapidly.\nClearly, however, many staff have been encouraged to use technology by exposure through\nthe programme. One survey question revealed major increases in the use of specific\napplications before and following attendance at QUILT events. Use of CD-ROMs was up\nby almost 70 per cent, Internet use was up by almost 30 per cent, email by 40 per cent, and\nPowerpoint by over 30 per cent. There was little change in the use of video conferencing.\n70\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\nPerhaps the most fundamental responses were those indicating changes in college ILT\/ICT\nstrategies following attendance at a QUILT event. The following are some examples of\nanswers to the related question:\n\u2022 It has evolved and we are now pro-actively pursuing ILT.\n\u2022 IT is now being used as a learning resource rather than just an administrative\/MIS tool.\n\u2022 We are no longer planning to write our own learning packages on CD-ROM. The\ncourse I went on backed up this decision.\n\u2022 We updated our ILT strategy with the assistance of a QUILT consultant.\n\u2022 Visits to QUILT events gave us an insight into possibilities for inclusion.\n\u2022 The college is much more aware of new technology and the need to improve its market\nreach. We are now setting up centres outside the college.\n\u2022 There has been an increased emphasis on ILT staff development needs and increasing\nawareness of the need for whole-college approaches.\nThe responses indicate the scale of ILT development already taking place in colleges and it\ncan be seen that in some colleges ILT strategies are clearly set within development planning\ncycles.\nIn terms of the actual skills developed from QUILT events, although there was still some way\nto go, all respondents agreed that the following had been enhanced to a considerable degree:\n\u2022 confidence in using a computer;\n\u2022 efficiency in using a computer;\n\u2022 understanding computer jargon;\n\u2022 applying IT day to day;\n\u2022 embedding ILT in programmes;\n\u2022 developing in-house materials;\n\u2022 facilitating and assessing learning;\n\u2022 ' improving flexibility of learning;\n\u2022 giving access to a variety of learning resources;\n\u2022 dissemination of information.\nWhen it came to limitations after attending events, the following are examples of responses\ngiven:\n\u2022 time to put new ideas into practice;\n\u2022 lack of, and availability of, resources;\n\u2022 lack of self-confidence and up-to-date knowledge in applying the technology in a\nclassroom setting;\n71\nKevin Donovan and Daniel Atwere QUILT: a case study in the impact of a staff development programme\n\u2022 access to equipment;\n\u2022 access to the technology is limited in my work area but has improved this year with a\nstaff ILT room. However without further training I do not have the confidence to\ndevelop in-house materials.\nAnswers about what further training staff needed included the following:\n\u2022 teaching with ILT as well as more awareness of practice in FE\/HE;\n\u2022 training about the 'why' as much as the 'how' to create and adapt materials;\n\u2022 increasing awareness of new developments in assistive technologies and equipment;\n\u2022 not one specific area, but a constant sharing of new ideas is useful;\n\u2022 more networking, contacts needed with other colleges;\n\u2022 in an area, such as technology, things are changing and developing so quickly that it\nseems necessary to hold events more regularly in order to stay up to date;\n\u2022 more visits to individual colleges would be useful - 'QUILT days'.\nIt will be noted that most, if not all, of these suggestions have been incorporated in, for\nexample, FERL (seminars in ILT 'Beacon' colleges) and the NLN.\nThe impact study also focused on QUILT-funded projects and their impact within the\nrelevant institutions. It should be noted here that over the three years, for example, most of\nthe English projects have been based on consortia rather than single colleges. Responses in\nthe first year of projects such as, 'This is the best staff development these colleagues have\never experienced', gave the team confidence to continue giving priority to this activity.\nOne question in the survey asked the respondents to comment on the status of their project\nafter completion. There are more favourable comments than there is space to reproduce\nthem but one single quotation gives an adequate flavour:\nThe project is continuing very well across the colleges who took part in the collaborative\nactivity. We have developed the QUILT theme and included the project in our\ndevelopment strategy. This project won a 1998-9 Beacon Award for ILT developments -\nmost definitely an extension of the original QUILT bid.\nA visit to the project reports on the Web - and to the work represented there by other sites\n- provides a rich source of information. At least two of the original projects have had\nmajor growth and impact. LeTTOL (Learning to Teach OnLine, at http:llwww.sheffcol\naaukllettoll) has grown beyond its original consortium of South Yorkshire colleges to\nreach students in many countries. Over 400 people (teachers, lecturers, trainers, materials\ndevelopers, and academic or technical managers, from the private and public sectors) have\ncompleted LeTTOL to date. It won the 1999 Becta Beacon Award for ILT to support\neffective learning. The scheme equips participants to teach learners online, support\nlearners using email and conferencing, manage online learning provision, employ the\nInternet as a resource for teaching and learning, and apply appropriate learning methods\nin the design of online learning materials. The majority of course activities, tutor support,\npeer interaction and assessment, take place online. The programme is accredited by the\n72\nALT-] Volume 8 Number 3\nUK's National Open College Network. Surrey Net (http:llwww.surreynet.org.uk\/) has\nspread its reach beyond colleges to schools and other public and private sector\norganizations. It is described as the 'intranet for the Surrey education community' and\nprovides information, advice communication, materials and discussion forums for users.\nThe first report of the NLN evaluation team included five example projects reflecting\nsuccessful outcomes from QUILT projects and colleges investigated by FEDA as part of\nresearch for FERL. What follows are very brief extracts, included to give a flavour of\nachievements. All these projects have been catalysts within the individual colleges and\nconsortia and the actual change has generally been greater than originally anticipated in\nterms of funding and meeting objectives of participation, retention and achievement.\nCity of Bristol College, in partnership with the College of Care and Early Education and\nBristol City Council Community Education Service, completed a QUILT project\nconcerned with the delivery of learning programmes through online learning. None of the\norganizations had previously used online learning to any significant extent. The partners\nfound that the reaction to the course was very positive with all college staff benefiting from\nboth the content and the experience of being an online student. The QUILT project\nhighlighted that, in order for a tutor to be effective in supporting online learning,\nstructured training must be provided.\nWigan and Leigh College, Liverpool Community College and Knowsley Community\nCollege looked at the use of video conferencing to enhance curriculum delivery. They\naimed to raise awareness of how video conferencing can be used in teaching and learning,\nto provide staff development in all three institutions, to share curriculum expertise via\nvideo conferencing and to explore the potential use of video conferencing for non-\ntraditional groups of students. The project team found video conferencing to be effective,\nin terms of time-saving, communicating at a distance and successfully sharing information,\nbut difficult from a social perspective and because of the great amount of preparation\nrequired. The team agreed that it was a better communication method than\nteleconferencing.\nAskham Bryan College, specializing in land-based vocational education for both HE and\nFE, used FERL funding to discover the practical uses for ILT in applied plant sciences.\nThe project was needed due to the widespread restructuring of college staffing and\ncurriculum. This was resulting in fewer teaching staff, but also more courses with flexible\ndelivery modes, shorter contact hours and longer self-study periods. The college also\nwanted to achieve economies of scale whilst maintaining quality. For example it was found\nthat the use of ILT encouraged students and tutors to interact both on and off campus.\nStudents who were unable to get to college could enjoy participation. There was initial\nstudent hostility but the systems have been effective in supporting students with learning\ndisabilities; one severely dyslexic student used 'talking diagrams' to great effect. Additional\nflexibility allows tutors to respond more easily to specific student needs, whether that need\nis the notes from a missed lecture or specialized learning support.\nSE Essex college completed a project looking at the problem of establishing what was\ncalled a fully interactive learning network. The college identified a number of limitations in\ntheir current arrangements for student management systems. A college-wide intranet, the\nproposed solution, must enable tutors to develop academic work such as course plans,\n73\nKevin Donovan and Daniel Atwere QUILT: a case study in the impact of a staff development programme\nassignments and other materials on the administration network and to be placed securely\non the academic network. It should also allow academic progress to be monitored so that\nelectronic course plans can direct individuals to relevant assignments and suitable course\nmaterials. Email allows contact between tutors and students particularly to send\nassignments and assessments securely. It also provides another route of communication\nand allows simple updating of student records directly into the database so that staff and\nindividual students can access it. The college has set itself a number of long- and short-\nterm goals including the introduction of interactive course plans, and the ability for\nstudents to email assignments to tutors. Most importantly the college expects to see\nreductions in costs through more effective deployment of teacher and teaching support\nroles.\nThe TROJAN project is a partnership among all nineteen West Yorkshire colleges. It\nsought to maximize the impact of new technology on small and medium-sized enterprises\n(SMEs) in the sub-region. Through collaboration the colleges were able to acquire cost-\neffective connectivity and good Internet access. The network was implemented quickly and\nhas proved an efficient and fast solution to connectivity requirements. Another successful\npart of the project was the development of staff training in relation to both technical and\ncurriculum issues, where staff have shared materials, venues and solutions. The project\nproduced a series of outcomes, such as an assignment framework and common\nquestionnaire, which have been used extensively outside the college. The project fostered a\n'champions' scheme.\nThe influence of QUILT was cited in the decision to devote part of the NLN funding to\ninnovative ICT projects. The first round produced around 170 quality bids, from which 12\nwere chosen to begin operation in colleges in the summer of 2000. Details will be found on\nthe planned NLN Website (http:\/\/www.nln.acuk). The project descriptions indicate in part\nhow far the FE sector has moved since QUILT set a base line just four years ago. The\nprojects have a range of aims covering support for more flexible learning, the management\nof such flexibility, and the application of a number of emerging technologies in the context\nof a radically changing lifelong learning environment.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion and summary, what do we know about ILT staff development on the basis of\nthe QUILT experience and its menu of activities? A successful programme must relate to\nthe overall mission of an organization and, to do this, it should include all staff and be part\nof a coherent approach, which embraces policy, strategy and operation. Within this wider\napproach small-scale action projects produce results: staff are motivated by involvement\nand outcomes often exceed what might be expected from small investment. Training and\nconsultancy can come in many guises (relevant events, peer support and so on), but they\nbreed enthusiasm if this is harnessed and given continued resources over time. Similarly\ninformation and inspiration can come in a variety of media but must be linked to practical\napplications: staff constantly seek ways to make their work more interesting and\nproductive and the experience of the QUILT programme is that exposure to new ideas can\nbe infectious.\n74\n"}
