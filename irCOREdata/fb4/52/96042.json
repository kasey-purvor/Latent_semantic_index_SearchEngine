Although such an analysis is plausible, it also offers a depoliticised vision of the \ncontemporary Central American panorama of violence. Basing itself principally on the example of \nNicaragua, the country in the region that is historically perhaps most paradigmatically associated with \nviolence, this paper offers an alternative interpretation of the changes that the regional landscape of \nviolence has undergone. It suggests that these are better understood as a movement from \u2018peasant wars of \nthe twentieth century\u2019 (Wolf, 1969) to \u2018urban wars of the twenty-first century\u2019 (Beall, 2006), thereby \nhighlighting how present-day urban violence can in fact in many ways be seen as representing a \nstructural continuation of past political conflicts, albeit in new spatial contexts. At the same time, \nhowever, there are certain key differences between past and present violence, as a result of which \ncontemporary conflict has intensified. This is most visible in relation to the changing forms of urban \nspatial organisation in Central American cities, the heavy-handed \u2018Mano Dura\u2019 response to gangs by \ngovernments, and the dystopian evolutionary trajectory of gangs. Taken together, these processes point to \na critical shift in the balance of power between rich and poor in the region, as the new \u2018urban wars of the \ntwenty-first century\u2019 are increasingly giving way to more circumscribed \u2018slum wars\u2019 that effectively signal \nthe defeat of the poor, and concomitantly the end of the utopian dreams of revolution that the region is \nhistorically associated with. \n \n \nAny city, however small, is in fact divided into two, \none the city of the poor, the other of the rich; these \nare at war with one another; and in either there are \nmany smaller divisions, and you would be \naltogether beside the mark if you treated them all as \na single State. \n- Plato, The Republic, Book IV. \n \nIntroduction \n \nIt has become increasingly commonplace to observe that the political economy of \nviolence in Central America has undergone a critical change during the past two decades, moving \nfrom ideologically-charged conflicts over the nature of the political system towards more prosaic \n\u2018post-conflict\u2019 forms of brutality such as delinquency and crime. This transformation is often \npithily characterised as a shift from \u2018political\u2019 violence to \u2018social\u2019 violence (see for example \n                                                 \n1 Senior Research Fellow, Brooks World Poverty Institute, University of Manchester, and Visiting Senior Fellow, \nCrisis States Research Centre, London School of Economics. Email: dennis.rodgers@manchester.ac.uk. A very \npreliminary draft of this paper was presented to the UK Development Studies Association (DSA) Urban Policy Study \nGroup meeting held at the London School of Economics on 15 May 2006, and a more developed version at the \nInstitute of Social Studies (ISS) \u201cCities of Extremes\u201d Lustrum conference held in The Hague on 15-16 October 2007. \nI am grateful to participants at both forums, as well as to Jo Beall, Sean Fox, and Development and Change \nanonymous reviewers for their thoroughly constructive comments and critiques. \n 2\nKoonings and Kruijt, 1999, 2004; Moser and McIlwaine, 2004; Pearce, 1998), and is frequently \nlinked to a broader Latin American \u2018crisis of governance\u2019, whereby the end of the Cold War, \neconomic liberalisation, incomplete democratisation, and intensifying globalisation have \nundermined the political authority of states and their ability to command a monopoly over the use \nof violence, reducing their roles as primary institutional channels for conflict, and making them \nless attractive \u2018spoils of war\u2019 (see for example, de Rivero, 2001; Friedman, 2003; Galeano, 1998; \nM\u00e9ndez et al., 1999). \u2018Non-political\u2019 forms of brutality are perceived to have emerged from the \nshadows of weakened states, so to speak, something that is widely considered most evidently \nreflected in the ubiquitous proliferation of gangs throughout the Central American region over the \npast twenty years (see Hagedorn, 2008). While this kind of \u2018governance\u2019 analysis makes a certain \namount of sense, it also implicitly assumes that violence in \u2018post-conflict\u2019 Central America is \neffectively \u2018post-political\u2019. This article seeks to problematise this assumption by suggesting an \nalternative lens through which to interpret the changes that the regional panorama of conflict has \nundergone during the past two decades. In particular, it suggests that focusing on the fact that \npresent forms of brutality are now overwhelmingly urban, contrarily to the past, provides us with \na critical insight into the continuing political dynamics of violence in the isthmus.  \nBasing itself principally on the example of Nicaragua, the Central American country that \nis historically perhaps most paradigmatically associated with violence, the article begins by \ntracing the geographical movement of conflict from country to city over the past three decades, \nbefore then drawing general parallels with the rest of Central America, describing in particular \nthe origin and nature of the contemporary predominant form of urban violence, namely the youth \ngangs known as pandillas and maras. This particular rural to urban trajectory is then theoretically \ncharacterised as a movement from \u2018peasant wars of the twentieth century\u2019 (Wolf, 1969) to \u2018urban \nwars of the twenty-first century\u2019 (Beall, 2006), thereby highlighting how although past and \npresent forms of brutality might at first glance seem very different, contemporary urban violence \ncan in fact in many ways be seen as a structural continuation \u2013 albeit in a new spatial context \u2013 of \nthe political conflicts of the past. At the same time, however, there are certain key differences \nbetween past and present regimes of brutality, as a result of which conflict has intensified in the \ncontemporary period. This is most visible in relation to three processes: the changing forms of \nurban spatial organisation in Central American cities, the heavy-handed \u2018Mano Dura\u2019 response to \ngangs by governments, and the dystopian evolutionary trajectory of gangs. These all point to a \ncritical shift in the balance of power between rich and poor in Central America, as the new \u2018urban \nwars of the twenty-first century\u2019 increasingly give way to more circumscribed \u2018slum wars\u2019 that \neffectively signal the defeat of the poor, and concomitantly the end of the utopian dreams of \nrevolution that the region is historically associated with. \n \nConflict, country, and city in Nicaragua and Central America \n \n Nicaragua has long been associated with violence (Torres Peres, 1997), but is probably \nmost famous for its Sandinista revolution, which overthrew the Somoza dynastic dictatorship in \n1979, after almost two decades of guerrilla struggle. Although the vanguard Frente Sandinista de \nLiberaci\u00f3n Nacional (Sandinista National Liberation Front \u2013 FSLN) combined both rural and \nurban tactics during its insurgency, it was primarily founded on a rural guerrilla strategy, inspired \nby the Cuban revolution and the Nicaraguan military leader Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino\u2019s historical \nstruggle against the US occupation of Nicaragua during the 1920s and 1930s. Such a rural bent to \nthe revolutionary struggle is by no means surprising. As Timothy Wickham-Crowley (1992) has \nsuggested, revolutions occur as a result of propitious social conditions, and in Nicaragua these \n 3\nwere clearly chiefly precipitated by rural factors. Broadly speaking, the revolutionary insurrection \nmirrored the rise of agro-export capitalism in Nicaragua, which led to \u2018the erosion of traditional \nagrarian society over a single generation [and] created the conditions for broad masses of the \n\u2026population to accept the revolutionary call and imbue it with the capacity to challenge the \nexisting order\u2019 (Vilas, 1995: 18). The Nicaraguan peasantry naturally became the backbone of the \nrevolutionary movement, and following the February 1978 uprising and subsequent crushing of \nthe indigenous village of Monimb\u00f3 \u2013 \u2018the spark that set Nicaragua alight\u2019, as the folk singer \nCarlos Mej\u00eda Godoy put it \u2013 began to join the FSLN\u2019s army en masse. Even if urban uprisings \nalso became important as the insurrection progressed, its fundamentally rural character is clear \nfrom the fact that the insurgency is reckoned to have triumphed on 19 July 1979, the day that the \nFSLN\u2019s troops marched into Managua from the countryside, rather than 17 July, when dictator \nAnastasio Somoza Debayle was actually toppled. \nAlthough the Sandinista regime unquestionably introduced less alienating forms of \neconomic organisation and property tenure in rural areas, clearly addressing some of the concerns \nof the Nicaraguan peasantry that had led to revolution in the first place, these reforms were often \nclumsily executed, particularly in the early years of the revolution (see Walker, 1997). Timothy \nBrown (2001) and David Stoll (2005) have suggested as a result that the conflict that broke out in \nNicaragua in the early 1980s \u2013 widely known as the Contra2 war \u2013 therefore included a \nsignificant element of indigenous peasant resistance to revolutionary change (see also Kalyvas, \n2004). Even if there are significant grounds on which to doubt the extent to which this \ncharacterization of the Contra war is accurate, it is certainly the case that it was principally a rural \nconflict. Indeed, although the Contra guerrillas had a devastating effect on the Nicaraguan \neconomy, destroying and disrupting communication and economic infrastructure, terrorizing and \ndemoralizing the population (see Harrisson et al., 1988; Torres Rivas, 1991), they were never in a \nposition to directly affect major urban centres, and all their military actions were confined to the \ncountryside, to the extent that Rose Spalding (1999) consequently labels the Contra war a \u2018low-\nintensity war\u2019 as a result. \n The end of the Contra war and the subsequent change of regime in 1990 marked the \nbeginning of a definite shift in the geography of conflict in Nicaragua, however, the logic of \nwhich was well summarized by Eduardo Galeano (1998: 314) when he remarked that \u2018while the \nstreets of Nicaragua\u2019s cities were peaceful during the years of formal conflict, once peace was \ndeclared, the country\u2019s streets became scenes of war\u2019. Although the first years of the post-\nrevolutionary era were marked by the presence in the countryside of several organized bands of \ndemobilized Contra guerrillas (\u2018recontras\u2019) and ex-Sandinista military personnel (\u2018recompas\u2019)3 \u2013 \nas well as occasionally mixed groups of both (\u2018revueltos\u2019)4 \u2013 pressing putative land claims or \nengaging in banditry, their modus operandi was significantly different to that of the warfare of \nthe 1980s. This was well illustrated in July 1993 when a 150-strong group of recompas occupied \nthe northern city of Estel\u00ed \u2013 Nicaragua\u2019s seventh largest \u2013 for several weeks, reportedly looting \nsome US$4 million from banks and shops before regular army troops drove them out at the cost \nof numerous casualties, including many civilians. In contrast to the war years, then, not only did \nurban areas become theatres of violence, but engagements also significantly involved non-\ncombatants, which had not been the case in the past, as the fact that less than 15 percent of \n31,000 casualties during the civil war of the 1980s were civilians shows well (Walker, 2003: 56).  \n                                                 \n2 From the Spanish word \u2018contrarevoluci\u00f3n\u2019 (\u2018counter-revolution\u2019). \n3 From the word \u2018compa\u2019, an abbreviation of \u2018compa\u00f1ero\u2019 (\u2018comrade\u2019). \n4 From the expression \u2018huevos revueltos\u2019, or \u2018scrambled eggs\u2019. \n 4\nBy the mid 1990s rearmed groups had declined to effective insignificance, and the most \nevident exemplification of this change in the geography of violence is clearly the dramatic \nexplosion in urban crime and delinquency that occurred in post-revolutionary Nicaragua. \nAccording to official Nicaraguan Police statistics, crime levels rose steadily by an annual average \nof 10 percent during the 1990s, compared to just 2 percent during the 1980s, with the absolute \nnumber of crimes almost quadrupling between 1990 and 2004. Crimes against persons \u2013 \nincluding homicides, rapes and assaults \u2013 in particular rose by over 460 percent.5 While the \noverall trend of increasing urban crime is undoubtedly accurate, official statistics are highly \nproblematic. As William Godnick et al. (2002: 26) note, \u2018given the anecdotal information on \nviolence as portrayed in the Nicaraguan press and the general perception of violence in \nNicaraguan society, these figures are suspiciously low\u2019. The national homicide rate \u2013 the \naccepted international benchmark for measuring violence \u2013 is particularly problematic, standing \nat an average of 15 deaths per 100,000 persons between 1990 and 2003 compared to almost three \ntimes that many in Honduras and over six times that in Guatemala and El Salvador (Moser and \nWinton, 2002: 47), suggesting that underreporting is a serious problem in Nicaragua.6\nCertainly, crime victimisation surveys suggest that levels of violence are extremely high. \nFor example, a 1997 survey reported that one in six Nicaraguans claimed to have been the victim \nof a criminal attack at least once in the previous four months, a proportion that rose to one in four \nin the capital city Managua,7 where 40 percent of all crime occurs (Granera Sacasa and Cuarezma \nTer\u00e1n, 1997: 32). Similarly, a 1999 survey found that urban crime was considered the principal \nproblem affecting the country by a margin of over 30 percent (PNUD, 2000: 130). The high \nlevels of urban crime were also very visible more qualitatively during the ethnographic fieldwork \nI carried out in the poor Managua neighbourhood barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez,8 and were starkly \nreflected in the social practices and discourses of local inhabitants. In 1996, for example, there \nwas a manifest fear of leaving one\u2019s home, with people going out as little as possible, and \nrestricting themselves to a few fixed routes and destinations. By 2002, even the shelter of home \nseemed precarious as houses were barricaded in an almost fort-like manner with high walls, iron \nbars, and barbed wire. An informant called Adilia dramatically described the situation as \u2018living \nin a state of siege\u2019, a depiction that takes on added significance when one considers that she lived \nthrough several \u2018real\u2019 military sieges during the revolutionary insurrection in 1978-9. \n                                                 \n5 Calculated on the basis of Serbin and Ferreyra (2000: 185-7), and data from http:\/\/www.policia.gob.ni\/. \n6 There are several potential reasons for this. The most important is clearly the inefficiency and weakness of \nNicaraguan state institutions. Since the change of regime in 1990, a slow process of de-politicisation and reductions \nin both size and budget \u2013 partly related to IMF and World Bank-imposed budget-cutting \u2013 have severely affected the \noperational capacity of the Police, which has only limited patrolling capacities in urban areas, and is completely \nabsent in 21 percent of the country\u2019s 146 municipalities (Cajina, 2000: 174). Furthermore, the Pan-American Health \nOrganisation (1998: 384) has estimated that over 50 percent of all mortalities in Nicaragua in 1995 were not \nregistered due to deficient record-keeping by hospitals and morgues. It should also be noted that both Presidents \nArnoldo Alem\u00e1n (1997-2001) and Enrique Bola\u00f1os (2002-06) made fighting crime a key element of their \nprogrammes of government and \u2018preferred\u2019 positive \u2013 i.e. low \u2013 crime statistics. Having said this, Nicaragua is \nclearly not as violent as El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras. \u2018Guesstimating\u2019 on the basis of qualitative studies, on \na rough scale of 1 to 100, if the most violent country, El Salvador, were ranked 100 in terms of gang violence, \nHonduras is likely to rank around 90, Guatemala around 70, Nicaragua around 50, and Costa Rica around 10. It \nshould be noted that the distribution of violence within these countries varies greatly, however, even if the \noverwhelming majority of gang violence occurs in urban areas, including in particular the capital cities. \n7 La Tribuna, 2 May 1997, page 4. \n8 This name is a pseudonym, as are all the names of informants mentioned in this article. \n 5\n According to the 1999 crime victimisation survey mentioned above, over 50 percent of \nrespondents identified youth gangs, or pandillas, as the most likely perpetrators of crime in post-\nrevolutionary Nicaragua (Cajina, 2000: 177). At one level, this is not surprising. Ever since the \nseminal gang studies carried out in the 1920s and 1930s by researchers associated with the \nChicago School of Sociology (see for example, Thrasher, 1927; Shaw and McKay, 1942; Whyte, \n1943), youth gangs have clearly emerged as paradigmatic forms of urban violence in societies all \nover the world. At the same time, their emergence as significantly violent social forms in \ncontemporary Nicaragua is clearly a specific hallmark of the post-revolutionary period. Until the \n1990s, Nicaraguan gangs \u2013 which can be traced back to the 1940s \u2013 were by all accounts small-\nscale and relatively innocuous youth aggregations. Their numbers however increased massively \nfrom 1990 onwards \u2013 partly due to the Contra and Sandinista Popular Army demobilisation of \nyouthful combatants \u2013 and they rapidly became a ubiquitous feature of the streets of Nicaraguan \ncities, which they roamed robbing, beating, and frequently killing. At their most basic, these \ncontemporary gangs consisted of variably sized groups of generally male youths between 7 and \n22 years old, that emerged in poor neighbourhoods and slums, and engaged in illicit and violent \nbehaviour \u2013 although not all their activities were illicit or violent \u2013 including petty crime and \ndelinquency, as well as semi-ritualised forms of gang warfare that obeyed a particular territorial \ndynamic (see Rodgers, 1997, 2000, 2006a, 2007b, 2007c).9\nSuch gangs have come to be found in all of the larger Nicaraguan urban centres including \nChinandega, Estel\u00ed, Granada, Le\u00f3n, Masaya, and Matagalpa, for example, but are most prominent \nin Managua, the capital city. By 1999, the Nicaraguan Police estimated that there were 110 gangs \nin the latter, incorporating 8,500 youths, double the number in 1996, and five times that in 1990 \n(Polic\u00eda Nacional de Nicaragua, 2001), although these statistics undoubtedly err on the low side. \nEven if not all acts of urban brutality in Nicaragua are perpetrated by these gangs, it is clear that \nthey have largely come to symbolically epitomize urban violence in the Nicaraguan collective \nconsciousness. For example, whenever my informants in barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez talked to \nme of crime, of violence, or of fear, in both 1996-97 and 2002-03, the word \u2018pandilla\u2019 never \nfailed to materialize in their discourses, often in the form of an expressive and despairing \nexclamation along the lines of: \u2018\u00a1Ay, estas pandillas, me matan, Dennis, me matan!\u2019 (\u2018Oh, these \ngangs, they kill me, Dennis, they kill me!\u2019). Similarly, the admonition \u2018cuidado las pandillas\u2019 \n(\u2018watch out for the gangs\u2019) became a familiar refrain, punctuating all comings and goings from \nthe household I lived in, to the extent that it almost had the equivalent verbal value of a more \ninnocuous \u2018hasta luego\u2019 (\u2018see you later\u2019). During the year that I spent living in barrio Luis Fanor \nHern\u00e1ndez in 1996-7, I tallied nine gang violence-related deaths, equivalent to a homicide rate of \n360 deaths per 100,000 persons, for example, which compares highly unfavourably with the \naverage annual civilian death rate of 124 persons per 100,000 due to warfare during the 1980s \n(calculated on the basis of Walker, 2003: 56).10\nSimilar movements from rural to urban violence can also be observed in other Central \nAmerican countries, which all display a general shift evolution in the geography of their violence \nfrom the country to the city over the past thirty years or so. The 1980-1992 civil war in El \nSalvador was widely characterised as a peasant rebellion (Wood, 2003), for example, while the \nrural character of the much longer war (1960-1996) in Guatemala is even more obvious due to its \nintimate association with issues of indigeneity (L\u00f6fving, 2002). But although indigenous \n                                                 \n9 See also Rocha (2000a, 2000b, 2003, 2005, 2007a, 2007b), and Rocha and Rodgers (2008). \n10 Obviously, this comparison must be taken with a pinch of salt, considering that my sample size is a single urban \nneighbourhood, well-known moreover for its high levels of violence. \n 6\nstruggles \u2013 particularly over natural resources \u2013 do persist up to a point in rural Guatemala, the \noverwhelming majority of contemporary violence in both countries is now urban in nature (see \nUNODC, 2007). This is well epitomised \u2013 perhaps even more so than in Nicaragua \u2013 by the \nemergence of the notorious mara youth gang phenomenon.11 Contrarily to the home-grown \nNicaraguan pandillas, the maras are phenomena that have transnational roots linked to US \nimmigration policy. Their origins can be traced to the 18th Street gang in Los Angeles, a gang \nfounded by Mexican immigrants in the Rampart section of the city in the 1960s, but which \nrapidly began to accept Hispanics indiscriminately, and grew massively during the late 1970s and \nearly 1980s particularly as a result of the influx of Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees \n(UNODC, 2007: 59; Bruneau and Boraz, 2006). \nBy the mid 1980s, the 18th Street gang it was one of Los Angeles\u2019 most important gangs. \nIn the late 1980s, however, it found itself confronted by a rival \u2013 possibly splinter \u2013 gang founded \nby a second wave of Salvadoran refugees, known as the \u2018Mara Salvatrucha\u2019.12 The two groups \nfought each other regularly, and were heavily involved in the violence and looting that \naccompanied the 1992 Rodney King riots, which led the State of California to implement strict \nanti-gang laws, and prosecutors began to charge young gang members as adults instead of \nminors, sending hundreds to jail for felonies and other serious crimes. This was followed in 1996 \nby the US Congress\u2019 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which \nprovided for non-US citizens sentenced to a year or more in prison to be repatriated to their \ncountries of origin, and for foreign-born American felons to be stripped of their citizenship and \nexpelled once they served their prison terms. As a result, in the eight years between 1998 and \n2005 the US deported almost 46,000 convicts to Central America, in addition to 160,000 illegal \nimmigrants caught without the requisite permit. Three countries \u2013 El Salvador, Guatemala, and \nHonduras \u2013 received over 90 percent of the deportations from the US (USAID, 2006: 18-19). \nMany of these deportees were members of the 18th Street and Salvatrucha gangs who had arrived \nin the United States as toddlers but had never secured legal residency or citizenship, and had \njoined the gang as a way to feel included in a receiving country that frequently actively impeded \ntheir integration. \nFollowing their exclusion from the US and arrival in countries of origin that they barely \nknew, they perhaps not surprisingly reproduced the structures and behaviour patterns that had \nprovided them with support and security in the US. Deportees rapidly began to found local \n\u2018clikas\u2019, or chapters, of their gang in their communities of origin, which in turn rapidly began to \nattract local youth and supplanted the existing local pandillas. Contrarily to sensationalistic media \nprojections, although each clika explicitly affiliates itself with either the Mara Dieciocho (as the \n18th Street gang is known in Central America) or the Mara Salvatrucha, and while clikas from \ndifferent neighbourhoods affiliated with the same mara will often join together to fight other \ngroupings claiming allegiance to the opposing mara, the umbrella gangs are not real federal \nstructures, and much less transnational ones. Neither the Dieciocho nor the Salvatrucha gangs in \n                                                 \n11 The origins of the word \u2018mara\u2019 are unclear. It has been widely suggested that it is derived from the word \n\u2018marabunta\u2019, a term used to describe a particularly vicious species of ants in certain South American countries. The \nfact that these do not include El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras makes it an unlikely proposition, although \nconsidering the US origins of the maras, it might be that the term derives from the classic US horror film \u2018The Naked \nJungle\u2019 (1954), in which an army of marabunta ants devastate a plantation in Brazil despite the best efforts of \nCharlton Heston, which was remade for television and widely shown in the early 1980s. This is purely speculative, \nalthough it is interesting to note that this putative link with cinema was also mentioned in the first study of gangs \never carried out in Central America (Levenson et al., 1988). \n12 A combination of \u2018Salvadore\u00f1o\u2019 and \u2018trucha\u2019, meaning \u2018quick-thinking\u2019 or \u2018shrewd\u2019 in Salvadoran slang. \n 7\nCentral America answer to a single chain of command, and their umbrella nature is more \nsymbolic of a particular historical relationship than demonstrative of any real unity, be it of \nleadership or action. Indeed, in many ways, the federated nature of the maras is more of an \nimagined social morphology, based on the fact that the steady flows of deportees from the US \nshare a common language and reference points. Certainly, there is little evidence of any \ncooperation between maras in El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, and even less with the \noriginal putative \u2018mother gangs\u2019 in Los Angeles. Rather, the ties that exist are more akin to a \nsense of identity, founded organically on individuals\u2019 common experience of gangsterism in the \nUS, deportation, and stigmatisation in Central America.13\nThis imaginary aspect of their transnationalism notwithstanding, maras are a very real \nphenomenon, and have spread throughout urban El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Official \nPolice statistics suggest that there are at least some 70,000 pandilla and mara members operating \nin Central America, although the estimates of NGOs and academics suggest that the number \ncould be as high as 200,000 (UNODC, 2007: 60). Even the lower figure would however mean \nthat there are a greater number of gang members than military personnel in Central America, \nhowever, as Nicaragua and Honduras have armies of about 12,000 soldiers each, El Salvador \n13,000 soldiers, and Guatemala 27,000 (see Millett and Perez, 2005: 59). These gangs clearly \ncontribute a significant share of the violence afflicting the cities of these countries. Reliable \ninformation is extremely scanty, however, with official statistics in particular especially \nproblematic due to chronic underreporting, deficient data collection, and issues of political \ninterference (see Huhn, Oettler and Peetz, 2006: 8-13). Nevertheless, Mo Hume (2007b) notes \nthat maras in El Salvador are thought to commit between 30 and 50 percent of all murders that \noccur in the country \u2013 which is reputed to be among the most violent in the world \u2013 while Ailsa \nWinton (2004: 85) notes that in Guatemala the ubiquity of gangs is such that \u2018there seems little \nneed for the perceived severity of the problem to be verified by actual data\u2019. Certainly, in many \ninstances levels of violence are currently higher in Central America than during the previous \ndecades of open warfare (see Call, 2000; Londo\u00f1o et al., 2000; UNODC, 2007). The annual \nnumber of violent homicides in contemporary Guatemala regularly exceeds the yearly tally of \nwar-related deaths that the country suffered during the height of the civil war in the 1980s (Moser \nand Winton, 2002: 33), for example, while the economic cost of crime in El Salvador was \nestimated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to be US$1.7 billion in 2003, \nor in other words equivalent to 11.5 percent of GDP, significantly higher than the country\u2019s \nestimated average annual loss of 3.3 percent of GDP due to war during the period 1981-5 \n(Ahrend, 1999: 7). \n                                                 \n13 These are crucial factors that explain why Nicaragua does not have maras. Not only does Nicaragua have a very \nlow deportation rate from the US \u2013 less than 3 percent of all Central American deportees are Nicaraguan \u2013 but \nfurthermore, Nicaraguans who have emigrated to the United States have mainly settled in Miami \u2013 according to US \nCensus data, only 12 percent have settled in Los Angeles, where they account for just 4 percent of Central Americans \nin the city, while in Miami they represent 47 percent \u2013 where contrarily to the more syncretic gangs of LA, the gang \nscene is dominated by highly exclusive African-American and Cuban-American gangs which do not let Nicaraguans \njoin them (Rocha, 2006). This is also explains why Nicaraguan pandillas are not as violent as maras, and by \nextension why El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are more violent than Nicaragua. The transnational \ntransposition of US gang culture in the Northern three Central American countries is has had much more brutal \nresults, most likely because it is less embedded within a local institutional context than traditional Central American \npandilla culture, and therefore less rule-bound and constrained. At the same time, however, it is important to note \nthat the mara phenomenon is not simply a foreign problem imported by deportees, but has also evolved and grown in \nresponse to domestic factors and conditions following its transposition. \n 8\nTo this extent, as Jenny Pearce (1998: 589) presciently pointed out, while \u2018the idea that \nthe region\u2019s conflicts have been \u201cresolved\u201d may be true at the formal level of peace accords \nbetween armies and insurgents, this is less so at the real level of people\u2019s everyday lives\u2019. Even if \nin contrast to the numerous sensationalist accounts linking Central American gangs to high-\nprofile criminality such as migrant trafficking, kidnapping, and international arms smuggling, it \nis clear from the various qualitative studies that exist that both pandillas and maras are mainly \ninvolved in small-scale, localised crime and delinquency such as petty theft and muggings,14 the \nextent to which such \u2018prosaic\u2019 brutality is prevalent in Central America has clearly given rise to \nwhat Kees Koonings and Dirk Kruijt (1999) very aptly describe as \u2018societies of fear\u2019, imbued \nwith a terror that is comparable to that of the war years of the past. Indeed, this is a point that was \nmade very forcefully to me by Pablo Alvarez, an inhabitant of the poor Managua neighbourhood \nbarrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez whom I interviewed in March 1997: \n \n\u2018I\u2019ve fought in all the wars of the last twenty years here in Nicaragua, \nagainst Somoza\u2019s dictatorship, against the Contras, and I tell you, war is a \nterrible thing. You see so much horror, so much death, you become like \nnumb, almost as if you were dead yourself\u2026 War changes you, it changes \neverybody \u2013 your family, your friends, your neighbours, everybody\u2026 \nEven the whole country change\u2026 \u201cNever again\u201d, that\u2019s what everybody \nsays, \u201cnever again, the war is over in Nicaragua, we're at peace now\u201d\u2026 \nThat\u2019s what they say, but have you seen how we live? Look at what\u2019s \nhappening in this country, all this delinquency, all this crime\u2026 People are \nscared, everybody lives barricaded in their homes because it's so \ndangerous\u2026 You can get killed for almost anything \u2013 money, jewellery, \nyour watch, but also your clothes, your shoes, or even for just looking at \nsomebody the wrong way\u2026 It\u2019s like this everywhere, in all the poor \nneighbourhoods\u2026 I tell you, this isn\u2019t peace, its war; we\u2019re living in the \nmiddle of a war again\u2026 The only difference with the past is that this war \nis no longer happening in the mountains [the countryside], but right here, \nin the city.\u2019 \n \nFrom \u2018peasant wars\u2019 to \u2018urban wars\u2019 \n \nThe rural nature of the Central American civil wars and revolutions of the 1970s and \n1980s was by no means exceptional. The starting point of Eric Wolf\u2019s (1969) classic exploration \nof the great popular revolutions of the 20th century is what he termed the \u2018peasant question\u2019, by \nwhich he meant \u2018the enduring presence of large, agriculturally based populations within societies \n                                                 \n14 Maras in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are however increasingly reported to be involved in the extortion \nof protection money from local businesses and the racketeering of buses and taxis as they go through the territories \nthey control (UNODC, 20007: 64), and there have admittedly been some high profile kidnapping cases associated \nwith maras, not least one involving the son of Salvadoran President Ricardo Maduro which ended with his murder. \nGenerally, though, \u2018gangs are \u2026considered to be distinct from organized criminal organizations because they \ntypically lack the hierarchical leadership structure, capital, and manpower required to run a sophisticated criminal \nenterprise. Gangs are generally more horizontally organized, with lots of small subgroups and no central leadership \nsetting strategy and enforcing discipline. Although some gangs are involved in the street-level distribution of drugs, \nfew gangs or gang members are involved in higher-level criminal drug distribution enterprises run by drug cartels, \nsyndicates, or other sophisticated criminal organizations\u2019 (Ribando, 2007: 1-2). \n 9\nthat were confronting the challenge of change and modernization posed by the new century\u2019 \n(Wolf, 1999 [1969]: ix). Although the details differ in each of the six cases he outlined, Wolf \n(1999 [1969]: 276-9) argued that the world-wide diffusion of \u2018North Atlantic capitalism\u2019 was \nleading to processes of peasant alienation due to the general commoditisation of land, which \nmeant that \u2018where previously market behaviour had been subsidiary to the existential problems of \nsubsistence, now existence and its problems became subsidiary to marketing behaviour\u2019. This \nwas accompanied by an increasing monopolization of agricultural resources by the owners of \nlarge estates, and a concomitant decrease of land holdings held by the peasantry. From this \nperspective, \u2018the peasant rebellions of the twentieth century [were not] \u2026simple responses to \nlocal problems \u2026but \u2026parochial reactions to major social dislocations, set in motion by \noverwhelming societal change. The spread of the market [tore] men up by their roots, and [shook] \nthem loose from the social relationship into which they were born\u2019 (Wolf, 1999 [1969]: 295). \nSuch an interpretation fits the historical experience of revolutionary violence in Central \nAmerica very well, but is clearly less applicable to describing post-revolutionary brutality if seen \nas a form of warfare. Even if certain continuities can be traced between past peasant rebellions \nand present urban gang violence \u2013 Nicaraguan pandillas for example have a definite elements of \nmilitarisation to them linked to the civil war (see Rodgers, 2006a), while mareros in El Salvador \nhave been reported as justifying their violence in terms clearly derived from the revolutionary \ndiscourse of the 1980s (Hume, 2007a) \u2013 Wolf\u2019s analysis doesn\u2019t really provide us with elements \nto understand the movement from the country to the city that the regional economy of violence \nhas experienced. One obvious alternative explanation for this shift, though, is simply the very \nnature of the changes that have occurred in regional demography and spatial morphology. \nUrbanization in Nicaragua has proceeded apace during the past two decades, for example, with \nthe country now the most urbanized in Central America as the urban population has grown by \nover 54 percent since 1990 compared to just 29 percent in rural areas,15 and urban settings have \nof course long been associated with violence. As Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies (2001 [1887]), Georg \nSimmel (1950 [1905]), and Louis Wirth (1938), for example, have all classically suggested, \nsocial relations in cities are weaker than in the countryside, with socially atomized urban dwellers \ntherefore being both more prone to violence and to being violent. Such a line of thought can be \nsaid to go a long way towards explaining the changed geography of Nicaraguan violence, and \naccords well with the discourse describing the transformation of the Central American political \neconomy of violence as a movement from political to social violence, insofar as the latter is often \ntypically depicted as a form of impersonal, anomic violence, which are also terms frequently \napplied to both urban and gang violence. \nAt the same time, however, as Henri Lefebvre (2003 [1970]) famously contended in his \nclassic book The Urban Revolution, the urban context not just as a geographical space, but also a \nspecific political realm. Indeed, Eric Hobsbawm (2005: 1) points out that \u2018whatever else a city \nmight be, it is at the same time a place inhabited by a concentration of poor people and, in most \ncases, the locus of political power which affects their lives\u2019, and it is when the existence of \ndisjuncture between the two that generally leads to the emergence of urban violence, and not the \nfact that cities are putatively inherently alienating spaces. In other words, urban violence and \nconflict are a function of the economic and political relations that exist within a city rather than \nanything to do with the intrinsic nature of cities. This is something that Jo Beall (2006) also \nimplicitly highlights in a recent article on cities, terrorism, and development, where she suggests \n                                                 \n15 Calculated on the basis of data from PNUD (2000) and the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edsticas y Censos \n(Nicaraguan National Statistics and Census Institute \u2013 INEC) website: http:\/\/www.inec.gob.ni\/.  \n 10\nthat \u2018Eric Wolf\u2019s (1969) Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century are increasingly giving way to \nwhat we might call urban wars of the twenty-first century\u2019 (2006: 110). By establishing such a \ngenealogy, Beall draws attention to the critical fact that just as Wolf\u2019s analysis of the \u2018peasant \nwars of the twentieth century\u2019 was underpinned by a \u2018peasant question\u2019, there is likely to be an \nanalogous \u2018urban question\u2019 underlying the new \u2018urban wars of the twenty-first century\u2019 such as \nthe ones that have emerged in post-conflict Central America. \nIn this respect, even if this \u2018urban question\u2019 has come to the fore partly because of natural \ndemographic processes, it can also be linked to a very definite socio-economic process that Mike \nDavis (2004, 2006) describes very well in his recent work on the global proliferation of urban \nslums. Contrary to conventional explanations of the world-wide growth of slums in terms of \nincreasing rural-urban migration connected to rapid economic expansion in cities due to \nintensifying globalisation, Davis contends that these new slums in fact house \u2013 so to speak \u2013 \nthose who increasingly find themselves expelled from the formal economy. Rather than being the \n\u2018engines of growth\u2019 that they are widely considered to be, cities in the South are rapidly \nbecoming \u2018dumping grounds\u2019 for those who are excluded from globalising and increasingly \ntechnological and informational production processes, with slums emerging as \u2018a fully franchised \nsolution to the problem of warehousing the twenty-first century\u2019s surplus humanity\u2019 (Davis, \n2004: 28). Davis maintains that these slums are consequently \u2018volcanoes waiting to erupt\u2019, and \nspeculates that their explosion might lead to the emergence of \u2018some new, unexpected historical \nsubject\u2019 bearing a \u2018global emancipatory project\u2019. The similarities with Wolf\u2019s conception of \npeasant rebels as revolutionaries are evident, and Davis\u2019 analysis can therefore be said to provide \na plausible \u2018urban question\u2019 to underpin Beall\u2019s \u2018urban wars of the twenty-first\u2019. \nIt is also an analysis that fits the evolution of Central American societies very well, \ninsofar as their economies have undergone profound changes during the past two decades as a \nresult of both regional and global transformations. Agricultural and manufacturing sectors, \nparticularly those geared towards domestic markets, have declined dramatically in importance, \nand economic activity has become based on more regionally- or internationally-oriented \nprocesses of production and accumulation, such as (liberalised) export-oriented manufacturing or \nfinancial services, neither of which are very labour intensive (see Robinson, 1998, 2003; S\u00e1nchez \nAncochea, 2007). Certainly, this new economic model is particularly obvious in the case of \nNicaragua, which saw the contribution of traditional agricultural and mineral productive activities \nto its export base decline from 76% to 35% between 1990 and 2005, while non-traditional \nactivities including in particular financial services, export-processing, and tourism all \nsignificantly increased their share during the same period (S\u00e1nchez Ancochea, 2007: 226). The \ncountry is furthermore clearly controlled by a small, elite oligarchy that looks to Miami and the \nUS in terms of economic, cultural, and residential interests \u2013 on this question see Mayorga \n(2007), Rocha (2002), and Rodgers (2006b, 2008) \u2013 and which tends to have little to do with the \nextremely impoverished mass of the population, a situation that bears obvious similarities to the \nones described by Wolf in his Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century. \nAt the same time, however, Wolf\u2019s thinking was predicated on a class-based analysis, \nwith peasant rebellions being ultimately seen as struggles over the means and relations of \nagrarian production. Although Davis (2004: 27) labels 21st century slum dwellers a \u2018vast informal \nproletariat\u2019, his overall characterization of the contemporary slum phenomenon rather \nundermines this categorization insofar as it postulates the unprecedented growth of slums as \nbeing the result of the disconnection of a large swathe of the economically active population from \nthe means of urban production, which is obviously the basis upon which class is constituted. In \nother words, if the \u2018urban wars of the 21st century\u2019 are to be seen as corresponding to a new form \n 11\nof class-based conflict, they must be about class, \u2018but not as we know it\u2019.16 Davis (2004: 28-30) \nrecognises this to a certain extent, questioning whether \u2018an informal proletariat possess[es] that \nmost potent of Marxist talismans: \u201chistorical agency\u201d?\u2019. He ultimately argues that slum dwellers \nlack the potential to constitute a meaningful \u2018class in itself\u2019, and much less a potentially activist \n\u2018class for itself\u2019, but that they nevertheless bear \u2018radical chains\u2019 in \u2018the Marxist sense of having \nlittle or no vested interest in the preservation of the existing mode of production\u2019 since they \u2018have \nbeen largely dispossessed of fungible labour-power\u2019. He suggests that forms of \u2018populist Islam \nand Pentecostal Christianity\u2019 constitute potential expressions of this political radicalism, even \ngoing so far as to suggest that they occupy \u2018a social space analogous to that of early twentieth-\ncentury socialism and anarchism\u2019. \nAlthough Pentecostal Christianity has made significant in-roads in Nicaragua \u2013 and \nCentral America more generally \u2013 during the past few decades (Hallum, 1996), it has had little in \nthe way of any visible impact in terms of large-scale collective mobilization among urban slum \ndwellers, as is well exemplified by the fact that its proliferation has not translated into electoral \nvotes for Pentecostal political parties (see Coleman and Stuart, 1997: 183).17 An obvious \nalternative vehicle for political radicalism is the supposedly \u2018prosaic\u2019 criminal violence \nchronically affecting contemporary Central American cities. As Franz Fanon (1990: 54) famously \nobserved in relation to the colonial struggle,  \n \n\u2018the gangster who holds up the police set on to track him down for days \non end, or who dies in single combat after having killed four or five \npolicemen, or who commits suicide in order not to give away his \naccomplices \u2013 these types light the way for the people, form the \nblueprints for action and become heroes\u2019.  \n \nSuch a vision would make the current urban brutality in Central America a continuation rather \nthan a break with the revolutionary rural violence of the past, and constitute gangs as a vanguard \nform of violence. At first glance this might seem implausible; gangs can clearly be construed as \ncorresponding to the \u2018ruthless Darwinian competition\u2019 that Davis (2004: 28) identifies as a \npossible dystopian option for excluded slum dwellers, whereby \u2018poor people compete for the \nsame informal scraps, ensur[ing] self-consuming communal violence as the highest form of urban \ninvolution\u2019, rather than any form of revolutionary class action. At the same time, however, Davis\u2019 \n\u2018informal proletariat\u2019 would not actually mobilise against oppression and exploitation as such, \nbut against exclusion, insofar as they constitute a superfluous \u2013 rather than a reserve \u2013 army of \nlabour in the new \u2018de-labourised\u2019 economy (see Rifkin, 1996). Contrarily to the rebellious \npeasantry that Wolf described, who were struggling over their position within a production \nprocess that they were a necessary part of, the struggle of today\u2019s slum dwellers is not so much \nover their role within the system as their non-position within it.18\n                                                 \n16 With apologies to Mr. Spock (of Star Trek). \n17 Populist Islam is obviously not a factor in Central America. \n18 Wolf\u2019s \u2018peasant wars of the twentieth century\u2019 were thus generally articulated around attempts to achieve more \nequitable distributions of the means of production that did not necessarily challenge the system as a whole. Certainly, \nthe difficulties the Nicaraguan revolutionary regime encountered attempting to collectivize the countryside\u2019s newly \ntenured peasantry following its land redistribution programme of the early 1980s is a testament to the fact that \npeasants rebels rarely seek to challenge the underlying basis of an existing social order, but rather seek to achieve a \ncertain uniform self-sufficiency. Hence Karl Marx\u2019s famous comment in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis \n 12\nSeen from this perspective, gangs much more plausibly constitute a potential vanguard \nform of social mobilisation of the new \u2018informal proletariat\u2019, certainly in Nicaragua where they \nwere localised forms of resistance against social exclusion during the 1990s. Although pandillas \nin Nicaragua unquestionably had extremely deleterious effects, anarchically transforming large \nswathes of cities into quasi-war zones, there was a clear difference in the social experience of \ngang violence depending on one\u2019s sociological standpoint. From a more localised perspective, \npandillas emerged as socially constitutive institutions in slums and poor neighbourhoods. Gang \nwarfare, for example, was clearly a constitutive process for pandilleros, playing a key role in the \nconstruction of the individual gang member\u2019s self-identity and contributing to the constitution of \nthe gang-group. But it was also about a broader form of social structuration that related to the \nlocal neighbourhood community. Gang wars followed set patterns: the first battle typically \ninvolved fighting with fists and stones, but each new battle involved an escalation of weaponry, \nfirst to sticks and stones, then to knives and broken bottles, and eventually to mortars, guns, and \nAK-47s. Although the rate of escalation varied, its sequence never did \u2013 i.e. gangs did not begin \ntheir wars immediately with firearms. The fixed nature of gang warfare constituted a mechanism \nfor restraining both the intensity and scope of violence \u2013 escalation is a process in which each \nstage calls for the application of greater but definite force of action, meaning that it is always \nunder actors\u2019 control \u2013 and also provided local neighbourhood inhabitants with an \u2018early warning \nsystem\u2019 that offered a means of circumscribing the \u2018all-pervading unpredictability\u2019 of violence \n(Arendt, 1969: 5).  \nThe negative consequences that gang wars could have for local populations were mainly \nindirect. The threat stemmed from other pandillas, whom the local gang engaged with in a \nprescribed manner. In a wider context of chronic violence and insecurity, this was very much \nrecognized as something positive by local neighbourhood populations, even if it was not always \neffective. As an informant in barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez called Don Sergio put it,  \n \n\u2018the pandilla looks after the neighbourhood and screws others; it protects \nus and allows us to feel a little bit safer, to live our lives a little bit more \neasily... Without them, things would be much worse for us.\u2019  \n \nIn many ways, however, gangs were not just the functional purveyors of a certain sense of \nsecurity, but also provided their local neighbourhood communities with a medium for enacting an \notherwise absent form of collective identity. There existed a strong sense of local association and \nempathy with pandillas in Nicaragua during the 1990s, thus constituting them as the principal \nanchor point for a notion of community in a wider context of extreme social exclusion. \nAdmittedly, this was limited, but as Charles Taylor (2002: 106) has underlined, the primary \nmeasure of any collective order is not its magnitude, but rather the degree to which it affects \u2018the \nways in which people imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others, how \nthings go on between them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally met, and the \ndeeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations\u2019 (for further details, see \nRodgers, 2006a, 2007b). \nIn other words, then, gangs, at least in their initially moment of emergence, institutionally \norganized and regulated local collective life in the slums and poor neighbourhoods of Nicaraguan \ncities, providing micro-regimes of order as well as communal forms of belonging to definite, \n                                                                                                                                                              \nNapoleon (2004 [1852]: 239) that the peasantry \u2018is formed by the simple addition of homologous magnitudes, much \nas potatoes in a sack form a sack of potatoes\u2019. \n 13\nalbeit bounded, collective entities, in a wider context of chronic insecurity and exclusion. The \nevidence regarding maras in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras is sketchier, but research has \nunderlined these as being similarly associated with processes of local solidarity and vigilante \nprotection, at least initially (see ERIC, IDESO, IDIES, IUDOP, 2001, 2004; Santacruz Giralt and \nConcha Eastman, 2001).19 To this extent, gangs in Central America can plausibly be said to have \ncorresponded during the 1990s to vanguard forms of \u2018insurgent citizenship\u2019 (Holston, 1999: 158), \nattempting to violently construct new spaces for \u2018possible alternative futures\u2019 within a context of \nwider urban exclusion. This makes them conceptually comparable to the peasant movements \nstudied by Wolf, insofar as the reasons for the emergence of such a form of \u2018insurgent \ncitizenship\u2019 are to be found in the broader structural processes, just as those of the revolutionary \npeasant movements were grounded in wider processes of traumatic social change due to \nprocesses of economic modernization. A critical difference between the peasantry described by \nWolf and Davis\u2019 new urban \u2018informal proletariat\u2019, however, is that the former mattered to the \nagrarian elite that exploited them, insofar as they were the source of their economic power \nthrough labour exploitation. The new \u2018informal proletariat\u2019 has no such value to the \ncontemporary transnational ruling elites in Central America, and this has led to an intensification \nof conflict in the region, and a concomitant transformation in the nature of the gangs. \n \nThe intensification of conflict in contemporary Central America \n \nAlthough the maras and pandillas that have come to prominence in the post-conflict \nCentral American settings are undoubtedly an important source of contemporary regional \nbrutality, there has also been a significant escalation in violence during the past decade as a result \nof other processes. One of these is directly associable with the new urban nature of the regional \npanorama of violence, namely the widespread purposeful processes of spatial segregation that \nhave occurred in Central American cities \u2013 and Latin America more generally (see Caldeira, \n2000; Jones and Ward, 2004) \u2013 as a result of the proliferation of gated communities, closed \ncondominiums, and the neglect of public spaces. Nowhere is this more apparent than in \nManagua, where spatial segregation has amounted to a veritable \u2018disembedding\u2019 of the city (see \nRodgers, 2004). Instead of the classic gated community model of \u2018splintering urbanism\u2019 (Graham \nand Marvin, 2001) that has emerged in Guatemala or El Salvador, for example, Managua was \ntransformed between 1997 and 2002 through the constitution of a \u2018fortified network\u2019 by means of \nthe selective and purposeful construction of high speed roads connecting the spaces of the elite \nwithin the city: their homes, offices, clubs, bars, restaurants, shopping malls, and, of course, the \ninternational airport with its direct flights to Miami. The poor are excluded from these locations \nby private security, but also from the connecting roads, which are cruised at breakneck speeds by \nexpensive 4x4 cars, and have no traffic lights but only roundabouts, meaning that those in cars \navoid having to stop \u2013 and risk being carjacked \u2013 but those on foot risk their lives whenever they \ntry to cross a road. In other words, a whole \u2018layer\u2019 of the city\u2019s urban fabric was \u2018ripped out\u2019 of \nthe metropolis for the exclusive use of the elite, thereby profoundly altering the cityscape and the \nrelations between social groups within it. \nI have characterised this process as a \u2018revolt of the elites\u2019 \u2013 to use Christopher Lasch\u2019s \n(1995) famous expression \u2013 insofar as most of the urban transformation undergone by Managua \n                                                 \n19 Although it should be noted that most of this research has also highlighted that maras are generally much more \nambiguous social phenomena than pandillas, and are more frequently violent and predatory against their local \ncommunities. \n 14\nwas sponsored either by unregulated private initiative or else directly by the elite-captured \nNicaraguan state, partly in response to the utopian attempts of the Sandinista revolution to foster \nmore egalitarian forms of social organisation (see Rodgers, 2004, 2008). This \u2018revolt\u2019 has been \nfurthermore supported by new forms of urban governance that involve regular Police patrolling in \nrich areas of the city and on the new roads, on the one hand, and unpredictably and violently \npatrolling slums and poor neighbourhoods on the other, in order to precipitate localised \nconditions of terror and symbolically demonstrate the arbitrary power of the elite-captured state \n(see Rodgers, 2006b). The socio-spatial separation of Nicaraguan society into a small, \ntransnational elite living in the disembedded Managua, and those living in the slums and poor \nneighbourhoods that overwhelmingly make up the rest of the country, is thus enforced by means \nof both changing the built environment and the differentiated territorial regulation of the city. The \nnet result has been that urban violence is now mainly restricted to the city\u2019s slums and poor \nneighbourhoods,20 to the extent that the government actually promotes Nicaragua as \u2018the safest \ncountry in Latin America\u2019,21 as the richer urban areas \u2013 those that belong to the \u2018disembedded\u2019 \nManagua \u2013 as well as tourist destinations such as Granada or San Juan del Sur are now safe and \nvisibly free of violence. \nBut while this twin process of \u2018disembedding\u2019 and changed urban governance may have \nmade 21st century Managua a safe \u2013 indeed, almost idyllic \u2013 place of residence for the rich (see \nBabb, 2004), from the broader perspective of the city as a whole, it can be construed as a violent \nact of \u2018urbicide\u2019, to use the term that Stephen Graham (2003: 63) \u2013 following Marshall Berman \n(1996) \u2013 applies to \u2018the deliberate wrecking or killing of the city\u2019. Although in the wake of the \nglobal terrorist acts of 9\/11, 11\/3, and 7\/7, the concept of urbicide has been mainly used in \nrelation to acts of terrorist violence, it was originally coined to describe \u2018a deliberate attempt to \ndeprive people of the benefits of urban life\u2019 through processes of \u2018pernicious urban planning, \nevictions, involuntary relocation and the deliberate destruction of urban infrastructures for \npolitical purposes\u2019 (Beall, 2006: 111), all of which have been features of the urban reorganisation \nof Managua during the past decade. Such an analytical framework bears thinking about because, \nas Martin Shaw (2004) has pointed out, urbicide is a process that can be associated with \ngenocide. Although genocide is defined in a restricted manner in the 1948 Convention on the \nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as relating to any act \u2018committed with \nintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\u2019,22 it can \nnevertheless plausibly be used to refer to the destruction of any bounded social group, and is thus \nconceivably applicable to the elite-led process of urban disembedding in Managua that is not only \nreinforcing the economic exclusion of the city\u2019s poor, but in fact actively contributing to their \nextinction from a Davisian perspective, insofar as those living in the city\u2019s slums and poor \nneighbourhoods are excluded from the means of production and reproduction, and left to survive \nas best they can by viciously fighting each other over \u2018informal scraps\u2019 (Davis, 2004: 28).  \nObviously, any case for genocide would have to be made on the basis of negligence by \nthe elites of their responsibilities that come by virtue of being embedded in a collective urban \nspace constituted through a plurality of people (see Harvey, 2003), rather than any explicit \ncampaign of intentional mass extermination against the poor, but the principle remains. At the \n                                                 \n20 Indeed, a recent United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report has noted that the overwhelming majority of the \nviolence in contemporary Central American more generally is clearly poor on poor brutality (see UNODC, 2007). \n21 See for example President Bola\u00f1os\u2019 speech to the 29th Caribbean Basin Initiative Conference, 5 December 2005, \nhttp:\/\/www.presidencia.gob.ni\/presidencia\/files_index\/presidente\/Discursos\/2005\/Diciembre\/29%20NA%20CONFE\nRENCIA%20MIAMI,%20DE%20LA%20CUENCA%20DEL%20CARIBE%20CCAA-06dic.htm. \n22 See http:\/\/www.ohchr.org\/english\/law\/genocide.htm. \n 15\nsame time, however, when viewed from the standpoint that gangs potentially constitute a \nvanguard of the poor in the new \u2018urban wars of the twenty-first century\u2019, it is by no means \nevident that such a campaign is not happening, as a veritable regional \u2018war on gangs\u2019 has been \nwaged by Central American governments during the past 5 years. The opening salvo of this \ncampaign was El Salvador\u2019s adoption of a \u2018Mano Dura\u2019 (\u2018Iron Fist\u2019) policy promulgated by the \nSalvadoran President Ricardo Maduro in July 2003, which advocated the immediate \nimprisonment of gang member simply for having gang-related tattoos or flashing gang signs in \npublic, something that became punishable with 2 to 5 years in hail, and applicable to gang \nmembers from the age of 12 onwards. Between July 2003 and August 2004, 20,000 pandilleros \nwere arrested, although 95 percent were eventually released without charge when the Mano Dura \nlaw was declared unconstitutional by the Salvadoran Supreme Court for violating the United \nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). A new \u2018Mano Super Dura\u2019 package of \nanti-gang reforms was rapidly pushed through, which respected the provisions of the UNCRC but \nstiffened the penalties for gang membership to up to 5 years in prison for ordinary gang \nmembers, and 9 years for gang leaders (Aguilar, 2006). Although under the new law the Police \nneeds to have some proof of active delinquent behaviour in order to arrest an individual, El \nSalvador\u2019s carceral population has doubled over the past five years, from 6,000 to 12,000 \nprisoners, 40 percent of which are gang members (Hume, 2007b). \n Honduras implemented a comparable policy called \u2018Cero Tolerancia\u2019 (\u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019) \nalmost simultaneously in August 2003, which was also partly inspired by Rudy Giuliani\u2019s \n(in)famous eponymous policy in New York. Among the measures that this package promoted \nwas the reform of the penal code and the adoption of legislation that established a maximum 12-\nyear prison sentence for gang membership, a penalty which was later stiffened to 30 years, as \nwell as provisions for better collaboration between the Police and the Honduran army in urban \npatrolling. Guatemala likewise adopted its \u2018Plan Escoba\u2019 (\u2018Operation Broomsweep\u2019) in January \n2004, which although not as draconian as the Salvadoran Mano Dura and the Honduran Cero \nTolerancia still contained new provisions allowing minors to be treated as adults, and the \ndeployment of four thousand reserve army troops in troubled neighbourhoods in Guatemala City. \nNicaragua similarly regularly implemented a range of anti-gang initiatives from 1999 onwards, \nalthough these were of a significantly \u2018softer\u2019 nature, partly because of the less violent nature of \nthe pandillas compared to the maras.23 Although these crackdowns have been very popular with \nthe general public in all the Central American countries, they have also been vigorously opposed \nby human rights groups who are concerned with the potential abuse of gang suspects. More \nominously, organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have \npresented evidence \u2013 corroborated by the US State Department in 2005 \u2013 of the existence of \nparamilitary death squads in Honduras and El Salvador that are deliberately targeting gang \nmembers, and often youth more generally, moreover in collusion with state authorities (see Faux, \n2006). \n At a more regional level, Central American states have also begun to engage in \nunprecedented forms of cooperation in order to deal with gangs, which a September 2003 \nregional summit of heads of state declared to be \u2018a destabilising menace, more immediate than \nany conventional war or guerrilla\u2019. In January 2004, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and \n                                                 \n23 At the same time, it is important to note that although the Nicaraguan Police has gained a reputation for focusing \non \u2018preventative\u2019 rather than \u2018repressive\u2019 anti-gang policies, the evidence of its practices on the ground tends to belie \nthis (see Rocha, 2007c), even if overall the response to gangs has not been as violent as in other Central American \ncountries, partly because of the less violent nature of the pandillas compared to the maras. \n 16\nNicaragua agreed to lift legal barriers to the cross-country prosecution of gang members, \nwhatever their nationality, while in March 2005, Presidents Tony Saca of El Salvador and Oscar \nBerger of Guatemala agreed to set up a joint security force to patrol gang activity along their \ncommon border. The Central American states have also sought to involve the US, which was \ninitially resistant to participate in anti-gang initiatives until June 2004, when the Honduran \nminister of Security, Oscar Alvarez, rather ludicrously claimed that a suspected Saudi member of \nAl Qaeda, Yafar Al-Taya, had arrived in Salvador in order to meet with gang leaders. Although \nclearly a completely unfounded assertion, by December 2004, the FBI had created a special task \nforce focusing on Central American gangs, and in February 2005 announced the creation of a \nliaison office in San Salvador to coordinate regional information-sharing and anti-gang efforts. \nFollowing a new (and no less ludicrous) claim by Oscar Alvarez to have thwarted a Colombian \nFARC-mara plot to kill President Ricardo Maduro in April 2005, the region\u2019s military leaders \nformally called on the US Southern Command for assistance in the creation of a multinational \nforce to tackle organized crime and youth gangs, although this has yet to be implemented. \n While it has been widely reported that the different anti-gang initiatives seemed to \ninitially reduce crime quite significantly, there evidence suggests that this was a temporary state \nof affairs, if ever true. There are increasing numbers of report that the widespread repression of \ngangs is leading to their becoming more organized and more violent (Aguilar and Miranda, 2006: \n42). This is something that was well illustrated by the tit-for-tat violence that certain maras \nengaged in with the Honduran government following the implementation of Mano Dura. On 30 \nAugust 2003, one month after the promulgation of the new anti-gang legislation, gang members \nattacked a bus in the Northern city of San Pedro Sula in broad daylight, killing 14, and leaving 18 \nwounded, as well as a note to President Ricardo Maduro ordering him to withdraw the law. The \nfollowing month, in the town of Puerto Cortes, a young woman\u2019s head was found in a plastic bad \nwith a note addressed to President Maduro saying that this was a response to the extrajudicial \nassassination of a gang member by the Police. Over the course of the following year, more than \n10 decapitated corpses were left in various cities with messages from gang members to the \nHonduras president, each time in response to a putative extrajudicial killing, and on 23 December \n2004, in Chamalecon, gang members again attacked a bus and killed 28, once again leaving a \nmessage claiming revenge for the May 2004 death of 105 gang members in a prison following a \nsuspect fire. Similarly gruesome events have been reported in El Salvador and Guatemala. \nAt the same time, however, the \u2018war on gang\u2019 has also reportedly led to maras becoming \nless conspicuous. Gang members in El Salvador have begun to use less obvious signs and \nsymbols, for example, including in particular getting rid of tattoos and no longer keep their hair \nin the short-trimmed rapado style, in order to avoid being picked up by the Police, and they have \nalso become more mobile, and the emigration of maras into Southern Mexico is also widely \nattributed to the repression (Aguilar and Miranda, 2006: 49). This retreat can be interpreted as \nreflecting the fact that the maras are losing ground vis-\u00e0-vis the dominant authority of Central \nAmerican states, but at the same time, it is also increasingly reported that maras are \nprofessionalizing and becoming more involved with organised crime (see Aguilar, 2006). Despite \nthe well-known association between increased violence and organised crime (see van Schendel \nand Abraham, 2005), this evolution suggests that gangs are losing the fight against exclusion as \nvanguard representatives of the urban poor, however, as by the evolutionary trajectory of \nNicaraguan pandillas between the mid 1990s and the early 2000s dramatically highlights. From \nsocially embedded institutions that displayed solidarity with their local communities, these \nbecame intensely predatory and parochial. Rather than protecting and federating local \nneighbourhood inhabitants, gangs now acted exclusively to ensure the proper functioning of local \n 17\ndrug economies in the interests of their members and associated local dealers \u2013 who were more \noften than not ex-gang members \u2013 through the imposition of localised regimes of terror based on \nfear, threats, and widespread acts of arbitrary violence (Rodgers, 2006a, 2007a, 2007b). \nThis particular evolution was clearly linked to the increasing difficulties of life in poor \nurban Nicaraguan slums, where the extreme poverty and lack of economic opportunities resulting \nfrom the ever-increasing socio-spatial exclusion and the country\u2019s new economic order made the \ngang\u2019s previous ethos of social solidarity with the local neighbourhood community unsustainable. \nAs a gang member in barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez called Kalia put it:  \n \n\u2018What the fuck do you do when you don\u2019t have any food and there\u2019s no \nwork? You have to find some other way to look out for yourself, that\u2019s \nwhat! That\u2019s where the drugs come in, it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s \nworthwhile doing here in the barrio. It\u2019s good money, but there isn\u2019t \nenough for everybody, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to try to help everybody, \nbecause that way nobody gets enough. You can\u2019t eat people\u2019s love and \ngratitude, you know, so you have to first make sure that you have \nsomething, and then perhaps give a bit to your family and friends, if \nthere\u2019s anything left, but nobody else. That\u2019s why the pandilla doesn\u2019t try \nto do things for the barrio anymore, because it doesn\u2019t work. People are \ntreacherous, so you have to be careful and look out for yourself.\u2019 \n \nFrom the perspective of most local neighbourhood inhabitants, this changed ethos meant that \ntheir situation worsened dramatically, as many individuals living in barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez \ntold me during visits in 2002 and 2003. The gang effectively became the vehicle for the \nemergence of a localised and limited \u2018narco-bourgeoisie\u2019 that sought to protect its \u2018primitive \naccumulation\u2019 through the imposition of a generalised regime of terror over those who did not \nbenefit (Rodgers, 2007a).  \nAt the same time, however during a field trip in 2007, it became evident that the gang had \nagain changed substantially, and was no longer embedded within the neighbourhood context in \nthe same way the pandilla had been in both 1996-97 and even 2002-03. The new locally \ndominant group was now made up of young men from several different neighbourhoods whose \ncommon point was their involvement in drug trafficking. The group displayed a clear leadership \nstructure, as well as a high degree of professionalism that had not been the case of the previous \nbarrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez gang avatars. To this extent, it was actually closer to being an \norganised crime group than a gang, something that was well reflected in the widespread use in the \nneighbourhood of the term \u2018cartelito\u2019 (\u2018little cartel\u2019) to describe it.24 Seen in the light of this \nparticular evolutionary trajectory, Central American gangs can be said to be increasingly \nfulfilling Davis\u2019 (2004: 28) dystopian prediction that \u2018ruthless Darwinian competition\u2019 and \u2018self-\nconsuming communal violence\u2019 will emerge in excluded slums and poor neighbourhoods if their \nimpoverished inhabitants were unable to challenge their marginalisation. When considered in \nrelation to the idea that contemporary Central American violence can be characterised as \u2018urban \nwars of the twenty-first century\u2019 that are the successor conflicts of Wolf\u2019s \u2018peasant wars of the \n                                                 \n24 The rise of a more professional criminal organisation can be said to have left no sociological \u2018space\u2019 for a violent \nyouth gang that might have hindered or challenged their activities. Although there were delinquent youth in the \nbarrio who might have formed a more \u2018classic\u2019 pandilla, these tended to only congregate in groups of one or two, and \nengaged in petty criminality mainly on a sporadic basis in order to sustain their regularly drinking and drug habits. \n 18\ntwentieth century\u2019, this implies that the Central American poor have in fact lost the war, and are \nnow embroiled in forms of internecine civil conflict that can perhaps most accurately be termed \n\u2018slum wars of the twenty-first century\u2019, insofar as they remain contained within the slums and \ndon\u2019t spill much into other areas of cities. \n \nConclusion \n \nThis paper has explored the implications of an alternative interpretation of the changed \nlandscape of violence in contemporary Central America. This has been widely portrayed in terms \nof an evolution in the regional political economy of brutality, namely from political to social \nviolence. I have proposed instead that these changes might be better visualized from the \nperspective of the geographical transition from the country to the city. I characterized this as a \nmovement from \u2018peasant wars of the twentieth century\u2019 (Wolf, 1969) to \u2018urban wars of the \ntwenty-first century\u2019 (Beall, 2006), and explored the way in which various social, economic, \npolitical, and spatial processes shaping contemporary Central America in turn shape the nature of \nconflict in the form of a contemporary \u2018urban question\u2019, analogous to Wolf\u2019s original \u2018peasant \nquestion\u2019. Even if new forms of urban brutality in contemporary Central America seem markedly \ndifferent to the revolutionary rural violence of the past that aimed at changing unequal economic \nsystems, their underlying structural dynamics as resistance to exclusion suggest that they can in \nfact be seen as a continuation of previous forms of (class) conflict in a new setting. I then \nexamined how the new \u2018urban wars of the twenty-first century\u2019 have involved an intensification \nof violence, illustrating this in relation to processes of socio-spatial segregation affecting \ncontemporary Central American cities, the \u2018war on gangs\u2019 being waged by Central American \nstates, as well as a partly concomitant \u2018involutionary\u2019 evolutionary trajectory of the gangs that \ncan be conceived as constituting the vanguard of the impoverished masses in their struggle \nagainst a dominating and excluding transnational elite class (see Robinson, 2003). \nThese factors have combined to promote an increasingly poor-on-poor manifestation of \nviolence in Central America, which when considered in relation to the notion that contemporary \nCentral American brutality can be characterised as \u2018urban wars of the twenty-first century\u2019, \nwould seem to imply that the Central American slum-dwellers have in fact lost the war, with \nmost of the region\u2019s current violence best characterised as a form of internecine civil conflict for \nsurvival between the poor inhabitants of what Davis calls the \u2018planet of slums\u2019. These can \ntherefore most accurately be termed \u2018slum wars of the twenty-first century\u2019, insofar as they tend \nto be geographically restricted to such areas. The obvious question such an analysis raises is \nwhere do we go from here, and in this respect, I have little in the way of an answer to offer, and \neven less of an optimistic one. If anything, the dystopian evolution of gangs in Central America \ntowards more predatory and individualistic social forms has to be literally seen as a terrible \nharbinger of things to come for the region, insofar as youth \u2018have a stronger instinct for survival \nthan adults[,] \u2026no doubt \u2026because [they] adapt better and faster to exceptional circumstances\u2019, \nas the Lebanese film-maker Ziad Doueiri (1998) \u2013 maker of the extremely powerful film West \nBeyrouth (1998) \u2013 has pointed out. Seen in this light, what the defeat of gangs as the vanguard of \nthe urban poor in the post-conflict Central American \u2018urban wars of the twenty-first century\u2019 \nultimately arguably signifies is not only the end of the revolutionary dreams historically \nassociated with the region, but also the practical consolidation of the so-called \u2018era of neo-\nliberalism\u2019. \n \n 19\nReferences \n \nAguilar, J.
