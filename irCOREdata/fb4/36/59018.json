The proposed combination of \nexperimentation and modelling across ecophysiological and hydrological approaches proved \nto be useful to account for the behaviour of a given basin, so that it can be applied to compare \nHES provision for different regions or management alternatives. \n \n1 Introduction \nThe ability of ecosystems to infiltrate rainfall, sustain aquifers, and avoid erosion is a key \ndeterminant for the provision of hydrological environmental services (HES), especially in the \nhumid tropics where surface fluxes can be very high (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, \n2005). Woody plants and in particular agroforestry (AF) systems associating shade trees and \nperennial crops with deep root systems are assumed to enhance these HES in comparison to \ntraditional intensive cropping systems (Ataroff and Monasterio 1997; Vaast et al., 2005; Siles \net al., 2010), but it is crucial to verify and quantify this hypothesis. Costa Rica is renowned as \na promoter of HES by charging water users for the HES they receive from land owners (e.g. \nforest conservation), focusing on water quality (Pagiola, 2008). Hydropower producers, \ngenerating 78% of the total electricity consumption in Costa Rica during 2008 (ICE, 2009), \nare major HES payers. Coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world \n 2\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nemploying 100 million people (Vega and Rosenquist, 2001). In Costa Rica, coffee accounted \nfor 15% of the agricultural exports in 2008 and covered 2% of the territory (SEPSA, 2009). \nAs coffee plantations are present in the main basins used for hydroelectric generation in Costa \nRica, the eventual trade-offs of the payment of HES from hydropower producers to coffee \nfarmers become evident. Negotiation for these payments is facilitated between providers and \npurchasers when the service, or the impact of a given practice on the provision of the service, \nare clearly evaluated. However, links between land use, tree cover and hydrology in Costa \nRica have not been thoroughly investigated by quantitative research (Anderson et al., 2006). \nThere is a need of both, experimentation at the basin scale in order to evaluate the main \nhydrological processes, and of integrated modelling to understand the behaviour of all water \ncompartments, including hidden ones (e.g. the aquifer). \nThe partitioning of the water balance (WB) is a pre-requisite to evaluate HES such as \ninfiltration, aquifer regulation capacity, erosion control and contaminants retention in coffee \nAF systems. Comprehensive WB studies at basin scale, including closure verification by \nindependent methods, have been carried out in the developed world and for other land covers, \nlike those reported by Roberts and Harding (1996), Dawes et al. (1997), Ceballos and \nSchnabel (1998), Wilson et al. (2001) and Maeda et al. (2006). Some experimental basins are \nlocated in the tropics, like those in Brazil, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe and Panam\u00e1 (Fujieda et al., \n1997; Genereux et al., 2005; Charlier et al., 2008; Kinner et al., 2004), but no coffee AF \nbasins have been equipped so far. Some reports are available for coffee AF systems but at the \nplot level and for some particular fluxes such as throughfall and stemflow (Siles et al., in \nrev.), tree and coffee transpiration (van Kanten and Vaast, 2006; Dauzat et al., 2001), surface \nrunoff (Harmand et al, 2007), energy balance and latent heat flux (Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 1994). To \nour knowledge, there is no comprehensive study of the water balance partitioning of coffee \nAF systems at the basin level, including the behaviour of the aquifer. \nTruly balanced combinations of hydrological and ecophysiological experiments and models \nremain scarce, although they intrinsically carry a more realistic and comprehensive \nrepresentation of plant, soil and aquifer components at plot and basin scales. Most \nhydrological studies at basin scale use flumes for monitoring the streamflow and simply \nestimate evapotranspiration (ET), which prevents a true verification of the water balance \nclosure or the estimation of deep percolation. \n 3\nAs in the tropics we assumed that ET, including the re-evaporation of intercepted water (RIn), \nis an important component of the water balance, even for precipitations around 3000 mm \nyear-1, we decided to measure it directly by eddy-covariance (Baldocchi and Meyers, 1998; \nWilson et al. 2001; Roupsard et al., 2006), choosing a 0.9 km2 micro-basin embedded in a \nvery homogeneous coffee AF plantation. As an additional advantage, the eddy-covariance \nmethod can be validated itself by closing the energy balance (Falge et al., 2001). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nLumped, conceptual rainfall-streamflow models have been used in hydrology since the 1960s \n(e.g. Crawford and Linsley, 1966; Cormary and Guilbot, 1969; Duan et al., 1992; Bergstr\u00f6m, \n1995; Donigan et al., 1995; Havn\u00f8 et al., 1995; Chahinian et al., 2005). These models \nconsider the basin as an undivided entity, and use lumped values of input variables and \nparameters. For the most part (for a review, see Fleming, 1975; Singh, 1995), they have a \nconceptual structure based on the interaction between storage compartments, representing the \ndifferent processes with mathematical functions to describe the fluxes between the \ncompartments. Most hydrological models simplify the ET component based on potential ET \nroutines (FAO, 1998) or using very empirical, non-validated models for actual ET. However, \nimproper parameterization of the crop coefficient may severely affect the parameterization of \nhydrological resistances and fluxes. In constrast, ecophysiological models may operate \nefficiently at plot level but miss the partitioning between lateral subsurface runoff and vertical \ndrainage, and the dynamics of water in aquifers and rivers. This is a major limitation for the \nassessment of HES, which is mainly desired at the basin scale. \nIn the present study we attempted to couple two lumped models into a new and original \napproach, chosen to be scalable and parsimonious: a basin reservoir model similar to the \nCREC model (Cormary and Guilbot, 1969) and employing the Diskin and Nazimov (1995) \nproduction function as proposed by Moussa et al. (2007a, 2007b), and the SVAT model \nproposed by Granier et al. (1999). While the basin model was considered appropriate for its \nsimplicity and capacity to support new routines, the SVAT model was chosen for its \nparsimony (three parameters in its basic formulation), its robustness (uses simple soil and \nstand data in order to produce model runs for many years, avoiding hydraulic parameters that \nare difficult to measure and scale up), its ability to quantify drought intensity and duration in \nforest stands, and for its successful past validation in various forest stands and climatic \nconditions, including tropical basins (Ruiz et al., 2010).  \n 4\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \nThis paper aims to explain and model the hydrological behaviour of a coffee AF micro-basin \nin Costa Rica, assessing its infiltration capacity on andisols. The methodology consists of \nexperimentation to assess the main water fluxes and modelling to reproduce the behaviour of \nthe basin. First, we present the study site and the experimental design. Second, we develop a \nnew lumped hydrological model with balanced ecophysiological\/hydrological modules (that \nwe called Hydro-SVAT model). This model was tailored to the main hydrological processes \nthat we recorded (streamflow, evapotranspiration, water content in the non-saturated zone and \nwater table level) and that are described in the subsequent sections. Third, we propose a \nmulti-variable calibration\/validation strategy for the Hydro-SVAT model so we calibrate \nusing the streamflow and validate using the remaining three variables. Fourth, we make an \nuncertainty analysis to produce a confidence interval around our modelled streamflow values, \nand a sensitivity analysis to assess from which parameters this uncertainty might come. \nFinally, we discuss the main findings concerning the water balance in our experimental basin. \n \n2 The study site \n2.1 Location, climate and soil \nThe area of interest is located in Reventaz\u00f3n river basin, in the Central-Caribbean region of \nCosta Rica (Fig. 1a,b). It lies on the slope of the Turrialba volcano (central volcanic mountain \nrange of the country) and drains to the Caribbean Sea. The Aquiares coffee farm is one of the \nlargest in Costa Rica (6.6 km2), \u201cRainforest AllianceTM\u201d certified, 15 km from CATIE \n(Centro Agron\u00f3mico Tropical de Investigaci\u00f3n y Ense\u00f1anza). Within the Aquiares farm, we \nselected the Mej\u00edas creek micro-basin (Fig. 1c) for the \u201cCoffee-Flux\u201d experiment. The basin \nis placed between the coordinates -83\u00ba44\u201939\u201d and -83\u00ba43\u201935\u201d (West longitude), and between \n9\u00ba56\u20198\u201d and 9\u00ba56\u201935\u201d (North latitude) and is homogeneously planted with coffee (Coffea \narabica L., var Caturra) on bare soil, shaded by free-growing tall Erythrina poeppigiana \ntrees. The initial planting density for coffee was 6,300 plants ha-1, with a current age >30 \nyears, 20% canopy openness and 2.5 m canopy height. It is intensively managed and \nselectively pruned (20% per year, around March). Shade trees have a density of 12.8 trees ha-\n1, with 12.3% canopy cover and 20 m canopy height. The experimental basin has an area of \n0.9 km2, an elevation range from 1,020 up to 1,280 m.a.s.l. and a mean slope of 20%. \n 5\nPermanent streams extend along 5.6 km, implying a drainage density of 6.2 km km-2. The \naverage slope of the main stream is 11%. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nAccording to the classification by Mora-Chinchilla (2000), the experimental basin is located \nalong a 1.3 km wide strip of volcanic avalanche deposits, characterized by chaotic deposits of \nblocks immersed in a matrix of medium-to-coarse sand, which is the product of the collapse \nof the south-eastern slope of Turrialba volcano\u2019s ancient crater. The general classification \ngiven by the geological map of Costa Rica (MINAE-RECOPE, 1991) describes the general \nstratigraphy as shallow intrusive volcanic rocks, and the particular region as proximal facies \nof modern volcanic rocks (Quaternary), with presence of lava flows, agglomerates, lahars and \nashes. Soils belong to the order of andisols according to the USDA soil taxonomy, which are \nsoils developing from volcanic ejecta, under weathering and mineral transformation \nprocesses, very stable, with high organic matter content and biological activity and very large \ninfiltration capacities. \nAccording to K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification (Peel et al. 2007), the climate is tropical humid \nwith no dry season and strongly influenced by the climatic conditions in the Caribbean \nhillside. The mean annual rainfall in the study region for the period 1973-2009 was estimated \nas 3014 mm at the Aquiares farm station (Fig. 2). At the experimental basin the rainfall in \n2009 (3208 mm) was close to the annual mean, but showed a monthly deviation of \u00b1100 mm \naround the historical regime. Mean monthly net radiation ranged in 2009 from  5.7 to 13.0 MJ \nm-2 d-1, air temperature from 17.0 to 20.8 \u00b0C, relative humidity from 83 to 91 %, windspeed at \n2 m high from 0.4 to 1.6 m s-1 and potential evapotranspiration (FAO, 1998) from 1.7 to 3.8 \nmm d-1. \n2.2 Experimental setup \nThe \u201cCoffee-Flux\u201d experimental basin and instrument layout was designed to trace the main \nwater balance components employing spatially representative methods (Fig. 1c). It is part of \nthe FLUXNET network for the monitoring of greenhouse gases of terrestrial ecosystems. The \nhydrological measurements were recorded from December 2008 up to February 2010. \nRainfall and climate: rainfall was monitored at 3 m above ground in the middle of  3 transects \nof the basin, using three lab-intercalibrated ARG100 tipping-bucket (R.M. Young, MI, USA) \nconnected to CR800 dataloggers (Campbell Scientific, Shepshed, UK), and integrated every \n10 min. Other climate variables were logged on top of the eddy-flux tower with a CR1000, \n 6\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nevery 30 s, integrated half-hourly and using: Net radiation: NR-Lite (Kipp & Zonen, Delft, \nThe Netherlands); PPFD: Sunshine sensor BF3 (Delta-T devices Ltd, U.K.); temperature and \nhumidity: HMP45C in URS1 shelter (Campbell Scientific); wind-speed and direction: 03001 \nWind Sentry (R.M. Young, MI, USA). The theoretical evapotranspiration from a wet grass \nplaced under local climate conditions, ET0, was computed in accordance with FAO (1998). \nStreamflow: a long-throated steel flume (length: 3.9 m; width: 2.8 m; height: 1.2 m) was \nhome-built to measure the streamflow at the outlet of the experimental basin, to record up to 3 \nm3 s-1, the maximum estimated discharge for the study period from an intensity-duration-\nfrequency analysis. The flume was equipped with a PDCR-1830 pressure transducer \n(Campbell Scientific) to record water head at gauge point (30 s, 10 minutes integration), while \nthe rating curve was calculated considering the geometric and hydraulic properties of the \nflume using Winflume software (Wahl et al., 2000). A validation of the rating curve was \nmade successfully using the salt dilution method as well as a pygmy current meter. \nSoil water content: a frequency-domain-reflectometry portable probe (FDR Diviner2000, \nSentek Pty Ltd) was used to survey 20 access tubes distributed in the three study transects to \nprovide the mean volumetric soil water in the basin. The sensor measures at 10 cm intervals, \nreaching a total depth of 1.6 m. A measurement campaign through the 20 sites was carried out \nevery week. The sensors were calibrated by digging sampling pits in the vicinity of six test \ntubes, to obtain the actual volumetric soil water content from gravimetric content and dry bulk \ndensity. \nEvapotranspiration: the actual evapotranspiration from the soil, coffee plants and shade trees \nwas measured at reference height (26 m) on the eddy-covariance tower, similarly to Roupsard \net al. (2006). 3D wind components and temperature were measured with a WindMaster sonic \nanemometer (Gill Instruments, Lymington, UK) at 20 Hz. H2O fluctuations were measured \nwith a Li-7500 open path (LiCor, Lincoln, NE, USA). Raw data were collected and pre-\nprocessed by \u201cTourbillon\u201d software (INRA-EPHYSE, Bordeaux, France) for a time-\nintegration period of 300 s, then post-processed using EdiRe software (University of \nEdinburgh, UK) into half-hourly values and quality checked. A validation was made by direct \ncomparison of the measured net radiation Rn with the sum of sensible heat flux (H) and latent \nheat flux (\u03bbE): at daily time step, this yielded H+\u03bbE=0.92 Rn (R2 = 0.93) which was \nconsidered sufficiently accurate to assume that advection effects on \u03bbE could be neglected \nhere. Due to lighting and sensor breakdown, 45 days of data were lost between July and \n 7\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nAugust 2009. To gap-fill the missing period we used the Penman-Monteith model, whose \ncanopy conductance was adjusted using measured values. \nLeaf Area Index (LAI): the coffee light transmittance was measured monthly in diffuse light \nconditions, for five rings at different zenital angles (LAI2000, Li-COR Corvallis, USA), along \nthree 50 m-long transects through the flux tower plot, similarly to Roupsard et al. (2008). \nEffective coffee LAI, obtained from this light transmittance, was converted into actual LAI \naccording to Nilson (1971), using a ratio of effective to actual LAI that was estimated from a \ndedicated calibration. The actual coffee LAI was measured directly on a small plot by \ncounting total leaf number of 25 coffee plants, measuring leaf length and width every 20 \nleaves and using empirical relationships between leaf length and width and leaf area (LI-\n3100C, Li-COR) (R2 > 0.95). On the same small plot, the effective LAI was measured with \nLAI2000. The ratio of effective to actual LAI was then calculated on this small plot (1.75) and \nwas considered to be constant with time and space in the micro-basin, allowing the estimation \nof the actual LAI on the three LAI2000 transects. The LAI for shade trees was estimated using \ntheir crown cover projection (on average 12.3% over the whole basin) observed on a very \nhigh resolution panchromatic satellite image (WorldView image, February 2008, 0.5 m \nresolution). As we did not have measurements of LAI for shade trees, we considered this LAI \nin the order of magnitude of coffee LAI on a crown-projected basis, and therefore we \nmultiplied the actual coffee LAI measured on transects by 1.123, to estimate the ecosystem \nLAI (tree and coffee). In order to monitor the time-course of ecosystem LAI at the basin scale, \nwe combined these ground measurements with time series of remotely-sensed images. We \nused time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Moderate \nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data products MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 \n(16-Day composite data, 250m resolution). NDVI is known to be correlated with the green \nLAI if it is low, for most ecosystems (Rouse et al., 1974). Twenty-three MODIS pixels \ncovering the experimental basin were selected, and their NDVI time series were downloaded. \nWe filtered the raw NDVI time series according to quality criterion given in the MODIS \nproducts, and we adjusted a smooth spline function on it as in Marsden et al. (2010). Then, a \nlinear regression between the smoothed NDVI of the pixel including the flux tower and \nground values of actual ecosystem LAI was calibrated (R2 = 0.69). This regression was used \non other pixels of the basin, and averaged to have the annual time-course of actual LAI. \n 8\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nWater table level: four piezometric wells measuring up to 4 m depth were built in the three \nmain transects of study. They were equipped with pressure transducers (Mini-Divers, \nSchlumberger Water Services) that measure and record the water table level every 30 \nminutes. \nPeriod of measurement, data gaps and gap-filling: the recording information is given in Table \n1 for the five hydrologic variables. The frequency of measurement varies, but is finally \ncalculated at the 30 minutes time step (except for soil water content that is a non-continuous \nmeasurement). When gaps are present in the measurements, a gap filling method was applied. \n \n3 Hydro-SVAT lumped model \nWe designed a lumped, five-reservoir-layer model to predict the water balance (WB) \npartitioning (stocks and fluxes) at the scale of the whole basin. It is based on the water \nbalance models developed by Moussa et al. (2007a, 2007b) and Granier et al. (1999), and \nbuilt to reproduce the main hydrological processes measured at the experimental basin, which \nwill be presented in Sect. 4. The model of Moussa et al. (2007a, 2007b) works at the basin \nscale and simulates the ecosystem evapotranspiration rather roughly, while the one of Granier \net al. (1999) works at the plot scale and totally ignores the lateral water fluxes through the soil \nand the role of the basin aquifers. The main novelties of the Hydro-SVAT model with respect \nto the model structure of Moussa et al. (2007a, 2007b) are the inclusion of a land cover \nreservoir to separate the intercepted rainfall from the combined throughfall\/stemflow \ncomponent, and the partition of non-saturated soil into two reservoirs, one with and one \nwithout roots of plants and trees. The first of these innovations intends to take into account \nthe non-negligible interception loss in coffee AF systems, as reported by Jim\u00e9nez (1986), \nHarmand et al. (2007) and Siles (2007). The second innovative addition to the model is to \nbetter represent the water dynamics in the non-saturated soil, given that only its upper layer \nwill lose humidity by root extraction. The water balance model of Granier et al. (1999) is \nincorporated in this superficial reservoir but in a simplified form, so that both, the root \ndistribution and the soil porosity, are homogeneous through the vertical, non-saturated profile. \nHence, the water content in this reservoir is the variable linking our two parent models. \nThe modelling hypotheses governing the model architecture were: a) the interception loss \ncomponent is not negligible in the WB and is a function of rainfall intensity, b) infiltration is a \nfunction of the soil water content in the non-saturated reservoirs, c) evapotranspiration is a \n 9\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \nsignificant component in the WB and is best described using a SVAT model that couples \nevapotranspiration to root water extraction from the soil, d) the aquifer has a higher discharge \nrate above a threshold level, and e) there is a net water outflow from the system as deep \npercolation. \nThe model was implemented using Matlab\u00ae V. R2007a (The MathWorks Inc., USA). \n3.1 Model structure \nThe model structure is presented in Fig. 3. The next three sections will describe the model \nstructure according to its three major routines and five layers. The first layer is called \u201cland \ncover reservoir\u201d and separates the total rainfall into an intercepted loss and a joint \nthroughfall\/stemflow component. The second layer or \u201csurface reservoir\u201d regulates the \nsurface runoff. The infiltration process from the second layer is controlled by the joint water \ncontent at the third and fourth layers, called \u201cnon-saturated root reservoir\u201d and \u201cnon-saturated \nnon-root reservoir\u201d, respectively. The evapotranspiration flux is calculated at the \u201cnon-\nsaturated root reservoir\u201d, while both non-saturated layers control the drainage, the percolation \nand the non-saturated runoff processes. The fifth and last layer is the \u201caquifer reservoir\u201d, \nwhich determines the baseflow and the deep percolation. Finally, we will explain the sum of \nthe total runoff and baseflow components and the routing procedure to generate the modelled \nstreamflow. Let A(t), B(t), C(t), D(t) and E(t) [L] be the water levels at time t in the five \nreservoirs A, B, C, D and E, respectively (or land cover reservoir, surface reservoir, non \nsaturated root reservoir, non-saturated no-root reservoir and aquifer reservoir). Let AX, BX, CX, \nDX and EX [L] be the water levels corresponding to the maximum holding capacities for the \nfive reservoirs. \n3.1.1 Infiltration and actual evapotranspiration \na. Infiltration \nThe infiltration process i [LT-1] occurs from the second layer (surface reservoir) to the third \none (non-saturated root reservoir), and eventually to the fourth one (non-saturated non-root \nreservoir) when i fills the third one. The infiltration capacity fi(t) [LT-1] is a state variable that \ndepends on the joint water level in these non-saturated reservoirs, given by the conceptual \nstate variable CD(t) = C(t) + D(t) [L]. Similarly, we define CDX = CX + DX [L] and CDF = CF \n+ DF [L] as the conceptual joint water levels for maximum and field holding capacities, \n 10\nrespectively, in the two coupled non-saturated soil reservoirs. Then, fi(t) is calculated as (see \nFig. \n1 \n2 4a): \nIf  then ( ) FCDtCD < ( ) ( ) ( ) 100 \u2212\u2212+= Fci CDtCDffftf     (1) 3 \n4 If  then        (2) ( ) FCDtCD \u2265 ( ) ci ftf =\nwhere f0 [LT-1] is the maximum infiltration capacity ( cff \u03b1=0 ) and fc [LT-1] is the \ninfiltration rate at field capacity. The infiltration i both modifies and depends on , which \nis the water availability in the second reservoir before i is extracted, according to: \n5 \n6 \n7 \n( )tB\u2032\nIf  then  and ( ) ( )tfttB i<\u0394\u2032 \u22121 ( ) 1\u2212\u0394\u2032= ttBi ( ) 0=tB     (3) 8 \nIf  then  and ( ) ( )tfttB i\u2265\u0394\u2032 \u22121 ( )tfi i= ( ) ( ) ( ) ttftBtB i \u0394\u2212\u2032=    (4) 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \nThe infiltration module calculates the infiltration i as output variable, using the state variables \nB(t), C(t), D(t) and fi(t). Six parameters (CX, DX, CF, DF, fc and \u03b1) are demanded. \nb. Evapotranspiration \nThe evapotranspiration component ET [LT-1] acts directly on the third layer (non-saturated \nroot reservoir) and is the sum of Eu [LT-1] the understory and soil evaporation, and of T [LT-1] \nthe transpirational water uptake by roots. \nTEET u +=           (5) \nAccording to Shuttleworth and Wallace (1985), the fraction of total evapotranspiration \noriginating from the plants is close to 100% of the total evapo-transpiration of the ecosystem \nwhen LAI >3 an when the soil is not saturated at its surface, which was always the case in our \nstudy. We thus assumed for simplicity that Eu, the evaporation from the soil, was nil. \nTranspiration T is obtained by solving T from the lightly modified ratio: r = T ET0-1 \n[dimensionless] proposed by Granier et al. (1999). We substituted the original Penman \npotential evapotranspiration PET in that ratio by the Penman-Monteith potential \nevapotranspiration ET0 [LT-1] (FAO, 1998). While ET0 was calculated at each time step \u0394t, \nwe estimated r as a function of the relative extractable water REW(t) [dimensionless], a state \nvariable given by Granier et al. (1999) as: \n( ) ( ) 1\u2212= FCtCtREW          (6) \n 11\nThe REW(t) is linked to the soil water content according to: 1 \n( ) ( )\nrf\nrttREW \u03b8\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u2212=          (7) 2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \nwith \u03b8(t): volumetric soil water content [L3L-3] at time t \u03b8r: residual soil water content [L3L-3] \nand \u03b8f: soil water content at field capacity [L3L-3]. \nThe parameter REWc [dimensionless] is the critical REW(t) below which the transpiration of \nthe system begins to decrease. Figure 4b shows an example of some r curves as a function of \nREW(t). Each curve can be defined only by REWc and the rmLAI, a maximum value for the \nratio r that depends on the LAI of the system as: \nmXLAI rLAILAIrm\n1\u2212=         (8) \nwhere LAIX is the maximum measured LAI during the modelling period and rm is a parameter \nindicating the maximum ratio T ET0-1 that can be found in this system. Then: \nIf  then ( ) cREWtREW < ( ) 1\u2212= cLAI REWtREWrmr     (9) 12 \n13 If  then        (10) ( ) cREWtREW \u2265 LAIrmr =\nFinally, we find the transpiration as 0ETrT = . The total modelled evapotranspiration \nincluding the interception loss, can be calculated as:\n14 \nInum RTEETR ++= , with RIn [LT-1] \nbeing the intercepted\/evaporated rainfall loss that will be explained in the next section. Hence, \nETRm can be directly compared to the evapotranspiration that we measured at the flux tower. \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nThis module provides the evapotranspiration ET as a function of the state variable C(t), two \ninput variables (LAI and ET0) and three parameters (CX, REWc and rm). \n3.1.2 Water balance in the model reservoirs \na. Land cover reservoir \nThe first layer of the model, denoted \u201cland cover reservoir\u201d, represents the soil cover in the \nbasin and controls the partition of the total incident rainfall R [LT-1] in intercepted (then \nevaporated) rainfall loss RIn [LT-1] and the combined troughfall\/stemflow RTS [LT-1]. A simple \nwater balance of this reservoir is established to calculate a proxy ( )tA\u2032  [L] of the final water \nlevel A(t) for each time step t, by adding the incident rainfall R and subtracting the Penman \npotential evapotranspiration PET [LT-1] from the existing land cover humidity level\n25 \n26 \n( )1\u2212tA : 27 \n 12\n( ) ( ) PETRtAtA \u2212+\u2212=\u2032 1         (11) 1 \n2 \n3 \nWe calculated the water level A(t) in this reservoir as well as RTS and RIn by differentiating \nthree cases: \nIf  ( ) 0\u2264\u2032 tA then  ( ) 0=tA and ( ) RtARIn +\u2212= 1 and 0=TSR  (12) \nIf  ( ) XAtA <\u2032<0 then  ( ) ( )tAtA \u2032= and PETRIn =  and 0=TSR  (13) \nIf  ( ) XAtA \u2265\u2032 then  ( ) XAtA = and PETRIn =  and ( ) XTS AtAR \u2212\u2032=  (14) \nThe land cover module calculates at each time t the water level A(t) as a state variable, \ndemanding two input variables (R and PET) and one parameter (AX). It yields the partition of \nR into RIn and RTS. \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \nb. Surface reservoir \nThe second layer is called \u201csurface reservoir\u201d and acts as a sheet top soil with a given \nroughness and surface runoff delaying properties. The water balance in this surface reservoir \nfor a given interval \u0394t is: \n( ) ( ) iQQRtBtB BBTS \u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212= 211        (15) \nwhere RTS [LT-1] is the combined throughfall\/stemflow component from the previous layer \nand QB1 and QB2 [LT-1] are the non-immediate and immediate surface runoffs calculated as: \n( )tBkQ BB =1           (16) \nwhere kB [T-1] is a discharge parameter, and: \nIf  then ( ) XBtB \u2264 02 =BQ         (17) 16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nIf  then       (18) ( ) XBtB > ( )[ ] 12 \u2212\u0394\u2212= tBtBQ XB\nIf QB2 > 0 then the water level B(t) is reset to BX. The infiltration i [LT-1] is a function of the \ncoupled water content in the third and the fourth layers and is the last component to be \nevaluated in the surface reservoir. \nThis surface reservoir module calculates the water level B(t) as a state variable and demands \none input variable (RTS), and two parameters for the reservoir (BX and kB). It produces three \noutput variables: i, QB1 and QB2. The two latter variables constitute the surface runoff in the \nbasin (Fig. 4c). \n 13\nc. Non-saturated root reservoir 1 \n2 \n3 \nThe \u201cnon-saturated root reservoir\u201d is the third layer of the model and it represents a soil layer \nwith presence of root systems from trees and plants. The water balance here is: \n( ) ( ) CQddETitCtC \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212= 211       (19) 4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n]\nwhere C(t) [L] is the state variable of the water level at a given time t, i is the infiltration from \nthe second layer, ET [LT-1] is the evapotranspiration, d1 and d2 [LT-1] are the non-immediate \nand  immediate drainages to the fourth layer, respectively and QC [LT-1] is the non-saturated \nrunoff from the root reservoir. \nThere will be immediate drainage d2 if at anytime the RTS component fills the reservoir above \nCX. Then  goes to the fourth layer and C(t) is reset to CX. Both non-\nimmediate drainage d1 and non-saturated runoff QC occur whenever C(t) is higher than the \nfield capacity threshold CF [L] according to: \n( )[ ] 12 \u2212\u0394\u2212= tCtCd X\n( )[ CF kCtC \u2212=\u03c1          (20) 13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \nwhere \u03c1 [LT-1] is the total outflow capacity in this reservoir and kC [T-1] a discharge \nparameter. The partition of \u03c1 in d1 and QC depends on a parameter \u03b2 [dimensionless], with 0 < \n\u03b2 < 1. Then: \n( ) \u03c1\u03b2\u2212= 11d  and \u03c1\u03b2=CQ        (21) 17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nThe root soil module calculates the water level C(t) as state variable using two input variables \n(i and ET) and four parameters (CX, CF, kC and \u03b2). It provides three outputs (d1, d2 and QC). \nd. Non-saturated non-root reservoir \nThe fourth layer of the model is denoted \u201cnon-saturated non-root reservoir\u201d and represents a \nsoil layer with total absence of root systems and hence, of root water extraction. The water \nbalance here is given by: \n( ) ( ) 21211 ggQddtDtD D \u2212\u2212\u2212++\u2212=       (22) \nwhere D(t) [L] is the state variable of the water level at a given time t, d1 and d2 [LT-1] are the \nnon-immediate and immediate drainages from the third layer, respectively; QD [LT-1] is the \nnon-saturated runoff from the non-root reservoir and g2 and g1 [LT-1] are the immediate and  \nnon-immediate percolation to the fifth model layer, respectively. \n 14\nImmediate percolation g2 will be produced if at anytime the drainage (d2 and\/or d1) fills the \nreservoir above DX. Then  moves to the aquifer reservoir and D(t) is \nreset to DX. Both non-immediate percolation g1 and non-saturated runoff QD occur whenever \nD(t) is higher than the field capacity threshold DF [L]: \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n]\n( )[ ] 12 \u2212\u0394\u2212= tDtDg X\n( )[ DF kDtD \u2212=\u03b7          (23) 5 \n6 \n7 \nwhere \u03b7 [LT-1] is the total outflow capacity of this reservoir and kD [T-1] a discharge \nparameter. The partition of \u03b7 in g1 and QD depends on the parameter \u03b2 [dimensionless]. Then: \n( )\u03b7\u03b2\u2212= 11g  and \u03b7\u03b2=DQ        (24) 8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \nThe non-root soil module calculates the water level D(t) as state variable using two input \nvariables (d1 and d2) and four parameters (DX, DF, kD and \u03b2). It provides three outputs (g1, g2 \nand QD). \ne. Aquifer reservoir \nA fifth layer called \u201caquifer reservoir\u201d represents the groundwater system and controls \nbaseflow and deep percolation. The reservoir is composed by a shallow aquifer that acts \nwhenever the water level in the reservoir is higher than EX, and by a deep aquifer with a \npermanent contribution. The water balance here is: \n( ) ( ) DPQQggtEtE EE \u2212\u2212\u2212++\u2212= 21211       (25) 17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \nwhere E(t) [L] is the state variable of the water level at a given time t, g1 and g2 [LT-1] are \nrespectively the non-immediate and immediate percolation from the fourth layer, QE1 and QE2 \n[LT-1] are the baseflow from deep and shallow aquifers respectively (Fig. 4d), and DP [LT-1] \nis the deep percolation. \nIf then ( ) XEtE \u2264 ( )tEkQ EE 11 =  and 02 =EQ      (26) 22 \nIf then ( ) XEtE > XEE EkQ 11 =  and ( )[ ]XEE EtEkQ \u2212= 22     (27) 23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n( )tEkDP E3=           (28) \nwhere kE1, kE2, and kE3 are discharge parameters controlling deep\/shallow aquifers and deep \npercolation, respectively. \nThis module calculates the water level E(t) as state variable using two input variables (g2 and \ng1) and four parameters (EX, kE1, kE2 and kE3), to provide three outputs (QE1, QE2 and DP). \n 15\n3.1.3 Total runoff, baseflow and streamflow 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nThe components of surface runoff, non-saturated runoff and baseflow are added to obtain the \ntotal runoff QT [LT-1]: \nQT = QB + QC + QD + QE        (29) \nAs explained in Moussa and Chahinian (2009) the streamflow Q [LT-1] at the outlet of the \nbasin is obtained by the routing of QT using a transfer function (to take into account the water \ntravel time). The Hayami (1951) kernel function (an approximation of the diffusive wave \nequation) is developed to obtain a unit hydrograph linear model for this purpose. That is: \n( ) ( ) ( )\u222b \u2212= t T dtHQtQ\n0\n\u03c4\u03c4\u03c4         (30) \nH(t) is the Hayami kernel function, equal to: \n( ) ( )\u222b\u221e\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212\n=\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\n0\n23\n2\n2\n1\n1and dttH\nt\nezwtH\nt\nw\nw\ntz\nF\nF\n\u03c0      (31) 11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwhere w [T] is a time parameter that represents the centre of gravity of the unit hydrograph (or \nthe travel time) and zF [dimensionless] a form parameter. Q in [LT-1] units can be transformed \nto volume units [L3T-1] multiplying it by the basin area [L2]. \n3.2 Model parameterization, calibration and validation \nSummarizing, this Hydro-SVAT model uses four input variables: rainfall R, Penman-\nMonteith ET0, Penman PET and leaf area index LAI to generate five main output variables: \ninterception RIn, infiltration i, evapotranspiration ET, discharge components Q = QB + QC + \nQD + QE (from surface, non-saturated and aquifer reservoirs, respectively) and deep \npercolation DP. \nFive state variables are calculated for every time step, the water levels in the five reservoirs: \nA(t), B(t), C(t), D(t) and E(t). C(t) and D(t) are summed to calculate CD(t) an equivalent water \ncontent for the non-saturated reservoirs, producing a coupled discharge QCD. \nIn our experimental basin we applied the model for a one-year period (2009), a time step \n\u0394t=30 minutes (1800 s) and a basin area equal to 0.886 km2.  \n 16\nThis model contains 20 parameters that are used to calculate infiltration (CX, DX, CF, DF, fc \nand \u03b1), evapotranspiration (REWc and rm), the exchange between reservoirs (AX, BX, kB, kC, kD, \n\u03b2, EX, kE1, kE2 and kE3) and the basin transfer function (w and zF). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \nFour out of these 20 parameters (CX, DX, CF, DF) were estimated using field data. For \ninstance, two excavation experiments down to 3.5 m showed that very few roots were present \nbelow 1.5 m, where the andisol layer turns into a more clayey, compact and stony deposit. \nThen, the depth of the non-saturated root soil layer was fixed at CH = 1.6 m (for simplicity, \nequal to the length of our FDR probe tubes). The depth of the non-root layer was estimated in \nDH = 1.0 m. Following the relationships ( ) HrsX CC \u03b8\u03b8 \u2212=  and ( ) HrsX DD \u03b8\u03b8 \u2212= , the levels \nfor maximum water holding capacities in the non-saturated reservoirs can be calculated, as \nwell as the levels for field capacities, using the equations \n9 \n10 \n( ) HrfF CC \u03b8\u03b8 \u2212=  and 11 \n( ) HrfF DD \u03b8\u03b8 \u2212= . The volumetric soil water contents \u03b8 were estimated as \u03b8r=0.37: the \nresidual water content equal to the minimum \u03b8 observed in the basin during the study period; \n\u03b8s =0.63: the \u03b8 at saturation for a typical andisol, according to Hodnett and Tomasella (2002); \nand \u03b8f =0.43: the \u03b8 at field capacity equal to the average van Genuchten value for a matric \npotential = -10 kPa (Hodnett and Tomasella, 2002). \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nThree parameters were taken from literature reviews and expert criteria (AX, REWc and rm). \nWe set the surface reservoir maximum storage capacity AX for our coffee AF system equal to \n4\u00d710-4 m using data from Siles et al. (in rev.). The two parameters of the evapotranspiration \nroutine were taken as: REWc=0.4 from Granier et al. (1999) and rm=0.8 from field \nmeasurements of T ET0-1 (data not shown). \nOne parameter (BX) was obtained at the end of the optimization process in order to fit the \nmaximum observed streamflow peak (this parameter is very sensitive as it acts directly on the \nhighest peaks). Two other parameters (w and zF) were separately estimated by a trial and error \nprocedure, given the low sensitivity of the model to their variation. \nThe remaining 10 empirical parameters (fc, \u03b1, kB, kC, kD, \u03b2, EX, kE1, kE2 and kE3) were \nsimultaneously optimized. For this purpose we used the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm \nincluded in Matlab on 17520 semi-hourly time steps (one year). Convergence was reached \nwithin 1000 runs and the stabilization of all parameter values by the end of the iteration \nprocess was checked. A two-step calibration procedure was applied: a) selection of an initial \nvalue for each parameter, falling within the respective range (fourth column, Table 2), and b) \n 17\nsimultaneous estimation of parameter values that maximize an objective function (sixth \ncolumn, \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nTable 2), in this case the Nash and Sutcliffe (1970) efficiency coefficient. \nConsidering that we have only one year of measurements at hand, the presence of seasonality \nin the data makes inadequate the use of partial validation methods (such as split-sample or \nbootstrapping), so we calibrated the model using only the streamflow Q, and then validated it \nusing the remaining three measured variables: evapotranspiration ETR, water content in the \nnon-saturated zone \u03b8 and water table level z. For ETR we grouped the measured and modelled \nvalues (given in the same units) at the daily time scale, which is the original time scale in \nGranier\u2019s model, and then we excluded the gap-filled values. To calculate the modelled \u03b8 \nfrom the water level in the root reservoir C(t) we used the relation \n, while the observed values were obtained as the average of the 20 \nFDR point-measurements throughout the basin. To validate z we proposed an effective \nporosity of the aquifer nA= 0.39, to be able to directly link piezometric measurements z with \nthe modelled water level in our aquifer reservoir E(t), according to z=E(t)\/nA. \n( ) ( ) rrsXCtC \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 +\u2212= \u22121\nFinally, we performed an analysis of model residuals: zero expectancy, normality, \nhomoscedasticity and standardized residuals. \n3.3 Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis \nIn order to investigate the uncertainty in model predictions we performed a Monte-Carlo \napproach on a restricted subset of parameter combinations, as suggested by Helton (1999). \nFor each of the 10 parameters a range was created with a deviation of \u00b130% around the \noptimum value found in the calibration process, following the \u201cone-at-a-time\u201d method \ndescribed by Hamby (1995). Then, we assumed a uniform distribution, using the Latin \nHypercube function of Simlab 2.2 (http:\/\/simlab.jrc.ec.europa.eu) in order to produce a \nsample from a joint probability distribution, ten times the number of parameters as \nrecommended, i.e. 100 parameter combinations. These combinations were introduced into the \ncalibrated Matlab program and we retrieved 100 output results of streamflow for each of the \n17520 semi-hourly time steps. Instead of generating 17520 empirical confidence intervals \nusing the respective frequency distributions, we preferred to build confidence intervals around \nthe modelled streamflow at each time step, by assuming a given probability distribution and \nestimating its parameters. First we proposed the normal distribution and checked 1% of the \ntime steps (175 distributions), most of which corresponded to recession phases: 146 out of \n 18\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \nthese 175 distributions (83%) presented a large asymptotic-significance value (>0.05) in a \nKolmogorov-Smirnov test so they resembled normal distributions. However, after sampling \nanother set of 1% time steps in the highest streamflow values (peaks), only 43% of them were \nnormally distributed. Therefore we could not assume normality for our data set and we used \nChebyshev's inequality to calculate more generic and conservative 95% and 99% confidence \nintervals. \nThe sensitivity analysis (SA) was also carried out using Simlab to determine which of the \ninput variables contributed significantly to this modelling uncertainty. Two separate \nassessments were produced. First, a summary (through the time) index for model performance \nwas studied: the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient NS, being assessed by four sensitivity indexes: \nPearson, Spearman, standardized regression and standardized rank regression coefficients \n(Hamby, 1994, 1995). Then, a second approach of sensitivity analysis was tested to try to \nfollow the behaviour of the Spearman coefficient for each of the 10 parameters included in the \nSA through all time steps, as in Helton (1999). \nThe sensitivity indexes are calculated departing from the joint probability sample matrix xij of \nsize m\u00d7n, where m is the sample size and n the number of independent variables (here our 10 \nparameters) to study. The Monte Carlo evaluation of xij in the model will produce the result \nvector yi, configuring the matrix system [yi : xij]. Then, the Pearson product moment \ncorrelation (PEAR) for a given parameter j is the linear correlation coefficient between the \nvariables xij and yi across the m samples. To account for non-linear relationships that can be \nhidden by indicators like PEAR, a simple rank transformation is applied, replacing the \noriginal x-y series with their corresponding ranks R(x) and R(y). Then, the Spearman \ncoefficient (SPEA) is obtained by calculating the correlation on the transformed data, as \nSPEA(x, y) = PEAR[R(x), R(y)]. The standardized regression coefficients (SRC) are the result \nof a linear regression analysis performed on [yi : xij] but previously standardizing all the \nvariables. This is useful to evaluate the effect of the independent variables on the dependent \none, without regarding their units of measurement, and can be computed by standard \nstatistical methods. Finally, the standardized rank regression coefficients are obtained as \nSRRC(x, y) = SRC[R(x), R(y)]. \n \n 19\n4 Results 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nIn the 0.9 km2 micro-basin of Mej\u00edas creek, within the Cafetalera Aquiares AF coffee farm, \nwe obtained one full year (2009) of comprehensive experimental results of streamflow, \nevapotranspiration, soil water content and piezometry that we used to calibrate and validate \nthe Hydro-SVAT model. First we present the hydrological behaviour of the basin, then the \necophysiological behaviour, and finally the water balance. \n4.1 Hydrological behaviour of the basin \nThe time series of streamflow Q and rainfall R are given at a semi-hourly time-step in Fig. 5a \nfor 2009. Rainfall (Fig. 2) was quite evenly distributed (no marked dry spell), although the \nperiod from January to June clearly received less rain (later named the \u2018drier season\u2019, in \nopposition to the \u2018wetter season\u2019). From the total R (3208 mm), the measured Q at the outlet \nwas 2048 mm, yielding an annual streamflow coefficient of 0.64.  The Q hydrograph (Fig. 5a) \ndisplays a continuous baseflow with episodes of groundwater recharge after rainfall events, \nfollowed by marked recessions controlled by the baseflow. Q peaks reached an annual \nmaximum of 0.84 m3 s-1, i.e. 25 % of the nominal capacity of the flume, indicating that the \nsize chosen for the flume was adequate. It can be observed that similar rainfall events resulted \nin much higher Q peaks during the wetter season. The lower Q peaks in response to rainfall \nevents during the drier season could thus be interpreted as the consequence of higher \ninfiltration rates when belowground was less saturated. Soil water content in the 0 - 1.6 m \nlayer (Fig. 5d) remained above 37% all-year round and rose up to a maximum of 47% during \nthe transition between the drier and the wetter season. In order to understand the large \nbaseflow shaping the hydrograph of Q, four piezometers were installed in early June 2009 \n(Fig. 5e) and showed the existence of a permanent aquifer at levels varying between 0.7 and \n3.2 m deep, according to their respective distance to water channels. Their behaviour was \nextremely variable, as expected, from responsive (piezos #1 and #3) to conservative \nbehaviours (piezos #2 and #4). The continuous baseflow observed by the flume originated \nmainly from an important aquifer, covering a large (although undefined) area within the \nbasin. \n 20\n4.2 Ecophysiological behaviour of the basin 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nThe ecosystem LAI index (Fig. 5b) changed seasonally quite severely from 2.8 (in March), as \na result of coffee pruning during the drier season and leaf shedding by E. poeppigiana, coffee \nflowering and new leafing just after the beginning of the wetter season, to a maximum of 4.8 \n(in September), then coffee leaf shedding during the main coffee-berry harvest (in October). \nThe actual evapotranspiration (ETR) obtained by eddy-covariance (Fig. 5c) accounted for the \nsum of coffee and shade-tree transpiration, understory evaporation (mainly bare soil), and \nrainfall interception loss. The total ETR in 2009 accounted for 818 mm (25% of R), \nfluctuating daily according to atmospheric demand and seasonally according to LAI and \ncanopy conductance. It remained always below 4.5 mm d-1 and, in average, around 60% of \nreference ET0, i.e. clearly invalidating the use of ET0 as a reliable indicator of ETR in coffee \nsystem hydrological models. The crop coefficient (the ETR ET0-1 ratio) was clearly lower \nduring the drier season, as a consequence mainly of a lower LAI. We did not observe a period \nduring which the relative extractable water (REW) of the soil drop below the critical value \n(REWc) of 0.4, confirming that the coffee plants probably encountered no seasonal water \nstress. \n4.3 Water balance partitioning and closure \nFigure 6 shows the water balance partition and closure for 2009, as obtained by the water \nflows measured by independent experimental methods, rainfall (R), streamflow (Q), and \nevapotranspiration (ETR) (including the rainfall interception loss). It was observed on \ncumulative values that the sum of Q+ETR was 11% lower than annual R. However, Q+ETR \nmatched or exceeded R once at the end of April, just after three episodes of lower rainfall, \nwhich confirmed the occurrence of an important storage in the basin, namely the soil and \naquifer reservoirs, creating a seasonal hysteresis between R and Q. On an annual basis, \nmeasured Q represented 64% of R and measured ETR amounted 25%. The remaining 11% \nwas attributed to deep percolation. \nFigure 7a shows the result of the streamflow modelling for the year 2009, after calibrating the \n10 parameters from Table 2. The model yielded a NS coefficient of 0.80 and R2 = 0.85 for n = \n17520 semi-hourly time-steps. Baseflow and peakflow events appeared to be satisfactorily \nrepresented for the whole time series. The modelled partitioning of streamflow into surface \nrunoff, non-saturated runoff and baseflow (before routing) is presented in Fig. 7b. It indicated \n 21\na prominent contribution of baseflow, as already inferred from visual inspection of the Q time \nseries. Hillslope surface runoff was a minor part of Q. The water stored in the 4 lowest \nreservoirs of the model is shown in Figs \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n7c to 7f. The water level at the surface reservoir was \nrarely greater than zero, indicating rare events of surface storage (with runoff capacity) \nbeyond the time step (30 minutes). The non-saturated reservoirs showed rather stable \nbehaviours. Finally, the aquifer reservoir displayed the largest magnitude of variation, \nfluctuating seasonally by a factor of almost 3. \n \n5 Discussion \nIn the next sections we first discuss the validation, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the \nmodel, then the main hydrological processes that we observed, and finally we examine the \nhydrological services in our coffee AF basin. \n5.1 Validation, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for the Hydro-SVAT model \n5.1.1 Model validation \nModel validation was done by direct comparison of model output variables with three field \nmeasurements: actual evapotranspiration ETR, soil water content \u03b8 and aquifer water level z. \nFor ETR, the determination coefficient between the daily sum of observed and modelled ETR \nwas R2=0.79 (Fig. 8a). Concerning \u03b8, the observed and modelled time series appeared to be \nconsistent, although not very precise in the driest season (Fig. 8b), reaching a rather low R2 = \n0.49. However, considering that this global \u03b8 was obtained as the arithmetic average of only \n20 observations for the whole basin, the uncertainty of these measured values is high. The \nlarge amount of rocks hindering the tubes might also affect the FDR readings. Finally, we \nobtained a fair approximation for the behaviour of the aquifer (Fig. 8c), with R2=0.90. The \nuse of the two piezometers that displayed the highest stability (i.e. probably representing a \nlarger volume of aquifer) out of the four installed piezometers was crucial at this step. We \nconsidered to be recording two different processes, the typical gradual aquifer response \n(piezos #2 and #4 in Fig. 1c) and the local quick-varying shallow-water accumulations (piezos \n#1 and #3 in Fig. 1c), which might be associated with rapid changes in soil water contents at \nsmaller and less representative aquifer units. Though the representativeness of these few \npiezometers of the behaviour of the main basin-aquifer could be questioned, the very high \n 22\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nsimilarity that we found between the modelled values and the average measurements from \npiezometers #2 and #4 (located in two opposite ends of the basin), supported the idea of a \ncorrect performance of both, the method for monitoring the aquifer and the corresponding \nmodel routine based on a linear reservoir. \nConcerning the precision of our model, the NS = 0.80 seems to be fair for a semi-hourly time-\nstep model, considering the detail with which the hydrological processes need to be described. \nSome studies that have evaluated hydrological models using this coefficient for different time \nscales have shown the decline in NS values as the modelling time step is shortened. For \ninstance, at calibration stages, Notter et al. (2007) achieved maximum NS values from 0.8 to \n0.69 for decadal to daily time steps (basin area = 87 km2), while Bormann (2006) obtained \n0.8, 0.9, 0.85 and 0.73 for annual, monthly, weekly and daily time steps, respectively (basin \narea = 63 km2). Garc\u00eda et al. (2008) reached NS coefficients of 0.93, 0.91 and 0.61 for \nquarterly, monthly and daily evaluations in a 162 km2 basin. \nTo study possible systematic errors in the Hydro-SVAT model, we examined the distribution \nof residuals between measured and modelled streamflows (since this was the optimized \nvariable). A t-test indicated that the average of our residuals (equal to 3\u00d710-4 m3 s-1) is \nsignificantly different from zero for a confidence level CL=95% but not for a CL=99% \n(p=0.02). Hence our model slightly underestimates the streamflow by 0.5% on average. At \nour short time step it is common to find autocorrelations in residuals, so that we found \nsignificant partial autocorrelations up to the eight time lag. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test \nrevealed that the distribution of residuals is not normal (which is not desirable). Studying \nresiduals as functions of time, rainfall R, streamflow Q, soil water content \u03b8 and water table \nlevel z (data not shown), we did not find any trends, but noticeable changes in their variability \nmake clear that the homoscedasticity condition was not properly fulfilled. However, it is \naccepted that these ordinary least squares assumptions are often not satisfied (Xu and Singh, \n1998).  \n5.1.2 Uncertainty analysis \nIf we accept that the model reproduces efficiently the actual streamflow at the outlet of the \nexperimental basin, the uncertainty in the modelled values needs to be known. A Monte-Carlo \n(MC) uncertainty analysis was produced as detailed in Sect. 3.3 to yield the 95% and 99% \nconfidence limits (CL) around the modelled streamflow (the 99% CL are presented in Fig. 9, \n 23\nalong with measured streamflow). Though the modelled series was always close to the \nobserved one, only 20% of the measured values fell within the 95% CL produced by our \nmodel, while 43% of them fell within the 99% CL. The ranges of the 95% confidence \nintervals (CI) along each of the time steps varied from 5% to 57% of the MC mean value, \nwhile for the 99% CI the ranges were from 11% up to 128% of the mean. From these analyses \nit is possible to state that the model is efficient (high NS coefficient) and precise (small \nconfidence intervals, Fig. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n9) modelling streamflow values, but is not highly accurate given the \nlow percentages of observed values falling within the 95% and 99% confidence intervals. \n5.1.3 Sensitivity analysis \nThe sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the responsiveness of the model \npredictions to variations in our main parameters. The first assessment consisted in testing the \nstatistical significance of the relationships between each of our 10 calibration parameters and \nthe NS coefficient, using four dimensionless sensitivity indexes: Pearson (PEAR), Spearman \n(SPEA), standardized regression and standardized rank regression coefficients (SRC and \nSRRC, respectively). Table 3 presents the results of these tests revealing that, with the \nexception of the shallow-aquifer threshold EX, none of the parameters seemed to significantly \ninfluence the global model efficiency. However, these results may be misleading given the \nenormously variable conditions under which the model works through time. Therefore, in a \nsecond approach we selected the Spearman test (a simple rank transformation index that can \nidentify non linear relationships) to assess the influence of each of these 10 parameters on Q, \nat each time step. Figure 10 presents the results, displaying the dimensionless Spearman index \nin the vertical axis and the time in the horizontal axis. A positive Spearman index reveals a \nproportional influence of the parameter on the model result, while negative values indicate \ninverse proportionality. Figure 10a shows the time series for all the parameters, revealing an \nalternation in their influence on Q over time and model state. The two black horizontal lines \nrepresent the 95% confidence limits above (or below) which the correlation is significantly \ndifferent from zero. In Figs. 10b to 10k the significant values are plotted as black points in \ncontrast to non-significant in grey, for each parameter separately. Figure 10h suggests that the \nparameter EX is again one of the most influential, because it is permanently displaying high \npositive or negative correlations, together with the discharge coefficient (DC) for the deep-\naquifer kE1, which has a proportional influence on model outputs (Fig. 10j). These two \nparameters reach the highest Spearman indexes during sustained periods (not only during \n 24\nevents) and are clearly relevant during long recessions, when the modelled water table level z \nis around or below EX. The DC for the surface reservoir kB is noticeably influencing model \noutputs but only during rainstorm events (Fig. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n10c), while the DC for the deep percolation kE3 \n(Fig. 10k) is significant during recessions. The vertical\/lateral split coefficient \u03b2 (Fig. 10b) \nreaches high Spearman values when the non-saturated reservoirs are being recharged, in the \nfirst stages of recessions when the humidity is above field capacity (directly proportional \neffect), or else during the driest part of the recessions (inversely proportional effect). The DC \nfor the root reservoir kC is significant when its humidity is higher than field capacity (Fig. \n10f), while the DC for the shallow aquifer kE2 (Fig. 10i) has proportional influence when z if \nabove EX or negative in the lowest part of the recessions. Finally, the infiltration rate at field \ncapacity (fc), the coefficient for maximum infiltration rate (\u03b1) and the DC for non-root \nreservoir (kD) seem to have no relevant effects on the Q modelling (Figs. 10d, 10e and 10g, \nrespectively). \n5.2 Hydrological processes in the experimental basin \nThe main hydrological processes and components observed using this measuring\/modelling \napproach are presented in the following four sub-sections. \n5.2.1 Interception, throughfall, stemflow and surface runoff \nA review of water balance (WB) partitioning in comparable situations is proposed in Table 4 \n(interception loss, evapotranspiration, surface\/non-saturated runoff, baseflow, change in soil \nwater content and deep percolation). In our basin, the adjusted interception loss (RIn) equalled \n4% of input rainfall (R). This value is the same as found by Imbach et al. (1989) in a WB \nexperiment under similar coffee and E. poeppigiana land cover, but is lower than other \nreports obtained by direct measurements at plot scale in Costa Rica: Jim\u00e9nez (1986) found \n16% under the same AF system; Harmand et al. (2007) found 15% for coffee and Eucalyptus \ndeglupta (but this RIn could be lower because stemflow was not separately measured); Siles \n(2007) found 11-15% under coffee and Inga densiflora. Interception loss can be greatly \naffected by the local LAI of both layers, the specific architecture of the coffee and trees and \nthe rainfall regime. \nFrom the throughfall\/stemflow component in our model (equal to 96% of R), 5% of R came \nout of the basin as surface runoff QB. This value is not far from other reports at plot scale, like \nthose by \u00c1vila et al. (2004): 1-9% (coffee and E. deglupta); Harmand et al. (2007): 2% and \n 25\nSiles (2007): 3-6% (coffee and I. densiflora). At basin scale, Fujieda et al. (1997) measured \n5% on a 0.56 km2 basin under a three layer forest in Brazil, Lesack (1993) modelled 3% in a \nrain-forest basin in Brazil (area: 0.23 km2), Kinner et al. (2004) modelled 4% in a Panamanian \ntropical-forest basin (0.10 km2) and Charlier et al. (2008) modelled 10% in a banana-\nplantation basin in Guadeloupe (0.18 km2). A major source of surface runoff and discrepancy \nbetween plot and basin scale studies could be the presence of roads. In our experimental basin \nthe total length of roads is 10 km and it represents 4.5% of the basin area. Then, assuming a \nnil infiltration, runoff on roads and ditches could represent up to 67% of the total surface \nrunoff. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n5.2.2 Infiltration and drainage \nThe non-intercepted and non-runoff fraction of incident rainfall was infiltrated (i = 91% of R). \nThis large i\/R ratio and a QB\/i ratio close to 5% give indication of very high infiltration and \ndrainage capacities, which are typical of andic-type volcanic soils (Poulenard et al. 2001, \nCattan et al., 2006) and are further enhanced for perennial crops in the absence of tillage and \nin presence of substantial macroporosity (Dorel et al., 2000). This was pointed out by \npreliminary measurements carried out in our experimental basin with a Cornell infiltrometer \n(Ogden et al., 1997) that steady state infiltrability values were as high as 4.7\u00d710-5 m s-1 (168 \nmm h-1) (Kinoshita, pers. comm.). Recent experiments found hydraulic conductivity values as \nhigh as 3.4\u00d710-5 m s-1 (122 mm h-1) and 2.1\u00d710-5 m s-1 (75 mm h-1) for andisols in Costa Rica \n(Cannavo et al., in prep.) and Guadeloupe (Charlier et al., 2008), respectively. From our \ninfiltration capacity (that was modelled as a function of soil water content in the non-saturated \nreservoirs), we calculated the infiltration\/rainfall (i\/R) and the runoff\/infiltration (QB\/i) ratios \nat the storm-event scale, analyzing 78 events with cumulative rain higher than 10 mm. No \nsignificant changes were found in any of these two ratios as a function of time (or season), \nand only slight reductions were detected for increasing storm cumulative rainfall or soil water \ncontent. This fact, added to the permanently high i\/R ratios for each individual event (65-\n98%), are explained by the constantly high infiltration capacity of andisols and the stable \nbehaviour of soil water content throughout the year. We therefore observed very efficient soil \nand aquifer recharge mechanisms (Fig. 7d to 7f). According to Dorel et al. (2000) the soil \nproperties of non-tilled perennial crops in andisols are mainly determined by wetting-drying \ncycles and by biological activity in the soil. Those are relatively stable factors in our \n 26\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nexperimental basin, given the absence of a well-defined dry season on this side of the country \n(Caribbean influence), and the permanently high organic matter content in these soils. \n5.2.3 Evaporation and transpiration \nTranspiration of coffee plants and trees T accounts for 21% of R (obtained from modelling). \nSimilar values for transpiration (23%) were reported by van Kanten and Vaast (2006) in \nvarious coffee AF systems, while Siles (2007) measured higher values ranging from 28 to \n34% (Table 4). In other experimental plots in Costa Rica, estimations of T ranged from 42 and \n53% (Imbach et al., 1989 and Jim\u00e9nez, 1986 respectively). T can be highly dependent on local \nET0, on the effect of drought on stomatal closure, and on LAI. For a better site comparison, we \ncomputed a simple \u201cnormalized transpiration\u201d index NT = T (ET0 LAI)-1 in Table 4 and found \nthat our value (0.16) is very close to the respective ratio in the study of Siles (2007). As \nmentioned earlier, we measured the actual evapotranspiration (ETR=T+Eu+RIn) in our \nexperimental basin by the eddy-covariance method and it represented 25% of R. This is the \nsmallest value reported in comparison to the other studies on coffee AF systems (Table 4). \nThe closest value (38%) was measured by Harmand et al. (2007), but it is about 1.5 times our \nETR, while a maximum of 69% was reported by Jim\u00e9nez (1986). It must be stressed that our \nstudy is the only one that brings independent validation of ETR through energy balance \nclosure, whereas many plot studies might carry errors due to the calibration of sapflow, the \nmodel of Eu or the sampling of RIn. At the basin scale, many authors modelled ETR values \naround 30% and 40% in tropical experimental basins (Lesack, 1993; Fujieda et al, 1997; \nGenereux et al., 2005; Charlier et al., 2008). \n5.2.4 Drainage and streamflow \nAnother component of interest at plot scale is drainage (vertical flow beyond root reservoir), \nwhich we modelled as 61% of R and seems, on average, slightly higher than the values \nreported in the literature (Table 4). The modelled deep percolation (or subsurface outflow \ndownstream the basin outlet) was 11%, much lower than the 42% reported by Charlier et al. \n(2008), but similar to the 6% encountered by Kinner et al. (2004). As deep percolation is \ncalculated from water balance closure, its accuracy is enhanced when Q and ETR are precisely \nmeasured. \nThe first or the second highest WB basin output is usually streamflow Q, which in our \nexperimental basin was recorded as 64% of R and modelled as 62%. It seems to be very close \n 27\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nto similar measurements in the tropics (Table 4). The baseflow from the aquifer accounted for \n63% of total Q, while surface runoff was only 8% and non-saturated runoff 29%. \n5.3 The coffee agroforestry basin and hydrological services \nModelling the hydrological behaviour of this experimental, coffee AF basin gave some \ninsights on the provision of HES by this system. This is particularly relevant in the Costa \nRican context where HES payments have already been implemented as national \nenvironmental protection policies (Pagiola, 2008). Two main services related to water quality \ncan be recognized, both linked to the observed high infiltration i (91% of R) and low surface \nrunoff QB (5% of R). \nAt first, the low QB in the basin is closely associated to low surface displacement of fertilizers, \npesticides and sediments (Cattan et al., 2006, 2009; Leonard and Andrieux, 1998, Bruijnzeel, \n2004). We found very constant QB\/i ratios through the time, or under different rainfall \nintensities, which may come from the expected stability in soil hydraulic properties (e.g. high \ninfiltration capacity) and the absence of either a marked dry season that controls soil \ndesiccation (Park and Cameron, 2008; Dorel et al., 2000) or mechanized agricultural practices \nlike tillage affecting soil compaction, surface roughness, continuity of pores, macroporosity, \nsoil cover and organic matter content (Le Bissonnais et al., 2005; Chahinian et al., 2006). \nHowever, the high drainage capacity of these andisols might be a disadvantage in terms of \npercolation and groundwater contamination by agrochemicals (Cattan et al., 2007; Saison et \nal., 2008) given our model estimates for groundwater recharge of around 52% of R. In \naddition, the modelled surface runoff for the experimental basin includes possible discharges \nfrom unpaved roads and ditches, which needs to be controlled to avoid excessive water, \nsediment and contaminant flux concentrations. \nA second HES might be the streamflow regulation function provided by this AF basin through \naquifer recharge\/discharge mechanisms. With a measured evapotranspiration close to 25% of \nR (which is presumably much lower than the equivalent for forests), soil and aquifer water \ndepletion seems unlikely under the observed hydrogeological and climatic conditions, \nfavouring water availability during dry seasons (Robinson et al., 2003; Bruijnzeel, 2004). On \nthe other hand, during intense rainfalls and tropical storms the aquifer is efficiently recharged, \nas we have observed in our piezometric measurements. The result is a homogeneous seasonal \ndistribution of streamflow, with a high rainfall recuperation fraction of 64% (Q\/R). \n 28\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n \n6 Conclusions \nThis paper gives some insights on the assessment of HES by studying the hydrological \nprocesses in a particular micro-basin. The water balance partition is proposed as a baseline for \nanalyses and negotiations leading to the payment of HES, for which measuring and modelling \napproaches are complementary. The understanding of water dynamics gave clear insights on \nthe main services provided by the studied ecosystem, as well as some potential vulnerabilities. \nThe general behaviour of the coffee AF basin (1 km2) on andisols can be summarized by the \nfact that 91% of R was infiltrated through the highly permeable andisol, 64% of R was \nmeasured as streamflow, 25% of R was measured as evapotranspiration, no major seasonal \nwater stock variation in the soil and a high contribution of the aquifer to the streamflow as \nbaseflow (Fig. 7b). These are characteristics of a system prone to generate important HES at \nbasin scale, which is a result infrequently reported for coffee systems. \nWe proposed an original modelling approach coupling a hydrological and a SVAT model, \ncalibrated using the streamflow at outlet of the basin but validated by independent and direct \nmeasurements of evapotranspiration, soil water content and water table level. These \ncomprehensive measurements also allowed supporting the hypothesis of having an 11% of R \nas deep percolation. \nWe presented a standard uncertainty analysis and developed a simple method to built generic \nconfidence intervals around our modelled streamflow values, as well as a sensitivity analysis \nto investigate the source of such uncertainty. The first parameterization of the model is \nconsidered adequate, though model simplification could be attempted centred on the two less \nsensitive parameters. Special attention needs to be given to direct measurement of a \nrepresentative field capacity and the associated probability distribution function. \nThe conceptual nature of our Hydro-SVAT model allows a wide time\/space domain of \napplication, conditional only on knowledge of some general properties of the basin of interest \nand on the acquisition of basic hydrological data. Different environments can be configured in \nterms of climate, land cover, soils and hydrogeology, and further applications under different \nconditions are desired to test the generality of the model. Complementary studies like \nhillslope and channel surface runoff, basin water losses through roads, temporal variation in \n 29\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \nsoil and ecophysiological properties and ground water dynamics and composition are \nexpected. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was funded by the Centre de Coop\u00e9ration Internationale en Recherche \nAgronomique pour le D\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD, France), the European project CAFNET \n(EuropAid\/121998\/C\/G) and the Cafetalera Aquiares farm (http:\/\/www.cafeaquiares.com). \nWe gratefully thank the Cafetalera Aquiares coffee farm for allowing us to install the \nexperimental basin and for providing us research facilities.
