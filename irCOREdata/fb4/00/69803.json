The 3-D adverts are contained within a novel\nvisual code design which allows the system to be\ndeployed without the requirement for additional\nnetwork infrastructure making it both practical and\naffordable for advertisers.\n1. Introduction\nAugmented Reality (AR) describes technologies that\nenable users to see and interact with virtual computer\ngenerated content which is superimposed on the real\n(physical) world. It enhances users\u2019 perceptions of the\nworld by mixing a view of it with virtual elements\nrelevant to their context [1]. In other words, AR\nintroduces a bridge between the real world and the\nvirtual one allowing content that exists only virtually to\nbe contextually associated with real places or objects for\nsimple and efficient access.\nAR is a well established academic research topic but\nhas yet to make an impact on the general public as it\noften requires highly specialized tools and equipment.\nTraditionally, the overlaid virtual objects are viewed\nthrough wearable head mounted displays (HMD),\nprocessed by portable computing units, and interfaced\nwith via mice, tracker-balls, digital gloves [2], stylus\npens, buttons, or specially designed visual code markers\n[3].\nWith the rapid development of mobile phone\ncapabilities and their feature sets, AR applications have\nbecome achievable on a larger scale [4,5,6]. In fact\nmany current mobile phones integrate all the required\nlab equipment for AR onto one device, albeit in a less\ncomplex form. For example, most have full-colour LCD\ndisplays and integrated cameras, representing the HMD;\nincreasingly powerful processors, replacing the portable\ncomputing units; and an array of possible input\nmechanisms, though generally limited to ITU keypad\nand joy-pad which are more restrictive than the\npreviously defined options.\nAs the number of worldwide mobile phone\nsubscribers has surpassed the two billion milestone (and\nrapidly approaching three billion), advertisers have the\nmouth watering possibility of accessing nearly one third\nof the estimated world population [7]. A previous\nresearch [7] has highlighted possible strategies for\nadvertisers to reach this audience and how they might\ndeploy successful mobile advertising campaigns and the\npossible limitations they may face. Further, we have\npreviously presented \u201c3D M-Ads\u201d in [8] which is the\nfirst system capable of delivering intuitive 3-D\nadvertising onto mobile phones. In this paper we extend\nthis approach by introducing another collaborative,\ncontext and privacy aware system that will open AR as a\nviable option for mobile advertising. It is an opt-in,\nclient-server advertising service with virtual objects\nsuperimposed onto views of the real world through the\nscreen of mobile phones.\nIn this paper we will concentrate on the mobile\nclient side of the system which is a camera-based mobile\nphone application targeting the Symbian OS platform. It\nis designed to locate and read specially designed\ncoloured tags which will allow us to display 3D\nadvertising content on top of the captured camera\nframes. In section 2 we describe the operation of the\napplication and how customers are able to interact with\nit. Sections 3, 4 and 5 present the solutions to the main\nquestions related to the system design:\n\u2022 What are the design requirements for the tag?\n\u2022 How does the mobile phone decode such a tag?\n\u2022 And, how is the superimposed content being\nrendered on screen?\nIn section 6 we identify some possible difficulties\nthat could face the system. Then we propose two\ndistribution mechanisms alongside the application\u2019s\npotential future development and usability in section 7\nbefore we draw our overall conclusions in section 8.\n2. The AR approach to mobile ads\nAR systems have been prototyped mainly in fields\nsuch as education [9], entertainment [10],\ncommunication [11] and remote control [12,13].

Restrictions apply.\nbusiness-oriented applications have rarely been pursued\ndue to the commercial difficulties and cost of supplying\nAR systems in sufficient numbers to the public.\nHowever, with the current generation of mobile phones\nexisting in such large numbers and becoming the most\ncarried items along with keys and money AR ads have\nbecome a viable business opportunity This project\npresents an AR system for interactive, entertaining and\ninformative advertising on mobile phones where\ncustomers involve with 3D-oriented experience in a\nmixture between the real and virtual worlds.\n2.1. Application rationale\nThe general public wear their mobile phones\neverywhere. They get exposed to casual adverting also\neverywhere: billboards, TVs, busses, newspapers etc\u2026\nInstead of limiting this experience to the quick-sight,\nflip-over and likely forget operation the proposed system\nwould allow individuals to actively interact and\ncommunicate with a new media form that embeds\nadvertisements within its content using the\ncommunication devices they are already familiar with\nand carry in their pockets all the time.\nWherever traditional ads may be found, we believe\nthe specially designed tags developed for this project,\nshown in Figure 1, can replace or augment them for a\ngreater visual experience, more subliminal effect and\nbetter satisfying results. The interaction process is\nsimple and easy-to-use for all age categories. The user\nwill only \u2018target\u2019 the tag with his\/her camera phone\nrunning the associated AR software, termed ARMAD\n(Augmented Reality Mobile Advertisements), which\nwill then automatically download and ultimately\nsuperimpose 3-D model(s)\/information on the location\nof the tag on screen. The downloaded content could be,\nbut not restricted to, one of the following:\n1. A 3-D model representing the product or the\nbrand being advertised enabling better viewing,\nawareness and affection\n2. Interactive textual information directing users to\nlocation-based services and\/or offers\n3. Visual links to events\u2019 and\/or promotions\u2019\nmobile web sites\n4. Location-based nodes for product-awareness\ngames\n5. Guiding avatars used for shopping centres\/malls\nproviding offers and promotions in addition to\ninformation about sales and directions\nFigure 1. Tag before augmentation\n2.2. The interaction process\nIn order to view and manipulate 3-D models on\nscreen the user simply has to rotate around the tag, if it\nis fixed, or rotate the tag, if it is mobile. The\nproducts\/info in the content of the ad will then be\nviewable from all angles as in Figures 2. Users can also\nzoom in\/out of the model by moving their phones closer\nto or further away from the tag, but keeping it within\nthe boundary of the screen, Figure 3.\nFigure 2. Normal and rotated views of the augmented\nmodel (desktop computer)\nFigure 3. Zooming in and out\nIt is possible for the user to select one model if many\nare displayed on screen by simply moving the phone so\nthat s\/he points the crosshair in the centre of screen,\nwhich can be viewed and hidden, to the top of the\ndesired model and then presses the selection button.\nSixth International Conference on the Management of Mobile Business (ICMB 2007)\n0-7695-2803-1\/07 $25.00  \u00a9 2007\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\nIf available, \u2018floating\u2019 text will be displayed on\nscreen to enable the user to retrieve further details of the\nproduct\/promotion, or to download it for future use.\nThis is achieved in the same manner as for selecting a\nmodel by using the crosshairs to select the augmented\ntext.\nThe user is able to delete or save instantly the\ndownloaded model for future retrieval. Currently the\ndownload process is limited to Bluetooth. Ultimately an\nover-the-air protocol via GPRS (General Packet Radio\nService) will be implemented to provide greater\nflexibility. Other technologies such as Wi-Fi and Wi-\nMAX would be addressed once sufficient amount of\nmobile phones supporting these technologies is widely\navailable in the market. Having a wider span of\naccessibility is the turning point for ARMAD to be a\nsuccessful mass advertising channel.\n3. Tag design\nThe target tag used to view AR ads with ARMAD is\ncomposed of four regions as shown in Figure 4 which\nare:\n1. a coloured area in the centre\n2. a black border surrounding the coloured area\n3. a code area as a boundary of the centre\n4. and 4 black corners of the code area\nThe coloured area is composed of four right-angle-\ntriangles: two red, whose tips are facing each other, one\nwhite to the right and one blue to the left. These\ntriangles are used to find the centre point of the tag,\nwhich is the point where their tips meet, and to\ndetermine its orientation. The centre point is used later\nto find the corners of the tag with the help of the black\nborder. The black border region is used to find the\ncorners of the coloured area first then will help in\ndetermining the corners of the tag as a whole. The next\nsection will describe the details of the detection.\nThe code area contains the data associated with each\ntag depicted in bits. It is composed of black and white\nblocks with four black bits reserved for tag corners. The\nblocks represent binary data and are capable of\nrepresenting 682 word options.\nSpecific sections of the code sequence can be\nreserved for such things as tag ID or the URL\/Bluetooth\naddress where the model may be obtained from. The rest\nof the code area is left for customized usage. Coded data\ndistribution is flexible according to requirements, with\nslight modification to application code.\nThe overall dimension of the tag is 11cm by 11cm\nfor height and width divided as follows:\n1. 5cm of both width and height for the coloured\narea\n2. 1cm width and 1cm height for each bit block\n(black or white)\n3. 1cm thickness for the black border of the\ncoloured area (its total dimension is 7cm by 7cm\nwith the coloured area inside)\nThe relatively large size of the tag is useful for\noutdoor placements of ads which will facilitate detection\nand viewing from far distances, and would allow more\nthan one user to have access to in the placement\nproximity. However, it is not practical when applied to\nprint media like magazines and newspapers, or even\ndigital media like PC monitors. Work will be conducted\nto optimize the dimensions of the tags for such space-\nlimited mediums depending on potential customer\nrequirements.\n4. Tag detection process\nThe detection process of the tag starts with the\ncoloured triangles. Once ARMAD is launched, the\ncamera on the phone starts capturing continuous frames\nand the application starts analyzing each frame\nindividually to find a potential tag. The detection\nprocess is applied through the following six steps by\nusing optimized image processing techniques for\ncoloured-target detection.\n4.1. Filtering frames\nBefore initiating any detection process there are two\nfilters applied on every video frame captured by the\ncamera in order to optimize tags detection process. First\nevery pixel in a frame is compared to a colour threshold\nto classify it in one of the five colour buckets: blue, red,\nwhite black and yellow. The first four will be used\nliterally: for instance whatever is \u2018redish\u2019 in the\ncaptured frame will be placed in the red bucket. The\nyellow colour on the other hand will replace whatever is\nnot red, blue, white or black in a frame.\nThe second filter is applied to fix the yellowed pixels\non edges in the initial image where anti-aliasing is\napplied. As the colours used in this effect most of the\ntime do not blend to any of the four buckets they are\nyellowed. Usually these edges are on the lines that\nseparate adjacent triangles in the colour area. Having\nyellow pixels in that critical region will affect the\ndetection process by falsifying true targets.\nFigure 4.

Finding tag centre point and orientation\nThe centre of a tag is identified, as long as it lies\nwithin the captured frame, by finding the pixel where\nred pixels are above and below it, a blue pixel is to its\nleft and a white one is to its right with an appropriate\nthreshold (4 pixels used here). The threshold is\nnecessary to facilitate centre detection even when\nblurring occurs while moving the phone relatively fast.\nThe positions of the coloured pixels surrounding the\ncentre point represent the triangles of the coloured area\nand they are relative to the orientation of the tag in\nregards to the phone. The previously mentioned red-red-\nwhite-blue sequence of colours is applicable when the\ntag is upright (rotated 0\u00b0). This will change according to\nits rotation degree. For example, if the tag is rotated 90\u00b0\nclock wise (CW), the detection of colours will take a\ndifferent sequence: white above, blue below and red left\nand right. Table 1 below shows all possible orientations\nwith their specific triangles colour sequences to use\nwhen detecting tags.\nTable 1: Colour sequences for different rotations\nAngle of rotation (CW) Triangle colours (above,\nbelow, right, left)\n315\u00b0 < \u012c\u0003\u0094 45\u00b0 Red, red, white, blue\n45\u00b0 < \u012c\u0003\u0094 135\u00b0 White, blue, red, red\n135\u00b0 < \u012c\u0003\u0094 225\u00b0 Red, red, blue, white\n225\u00b0 < \u012c\u0003\u0094 315\u00b0 Blue, white, red, red\n4.3. Finding corners of the coloured area\nThe logic used to find corners traverses the tag\nvertically upwards and downwards from the centre\npoint. Once it encounters an edge pixel where black\ncolour is above it and red is below it, in case of moving\nupwards, or black below and red above, in case of\nmoving downwards, the traversal is stopped and the\nlocation of that pixel is stored. The next step is to move\nright and left from that pixel until the end points of that\nedge, which represent the coloured area corners, are\nreached.\nIn case the tag is rotated finding the two end points\nof the edge will need to perform one additional step. A\nzigzag movement is taken from the centre point to get\nas close as possible to the end points required.\n4.4. Estimating tag corners\nOnce the corners of the coloured area are identified\nfinding the tag corners becomes a matter of\nmathematical replacement. In the design specifications\nabove it was stated that the coloured area has a width\nand height of 5cm each. Given that the code area has a\ndepth of 2cm and the black border has a depth of 1cm\nthe position of the code corner can be calculated as a\n58  factor of the distance between two diagonal colour\narea corners. For instance, the tag corner c1 can be\napproximated using the following equation from the\ncoloured area diagonal corners a1 and a3:\n)),(3),(1(),(3),(1\n5\n8\nyxayxayxayxc \u2212+=\n4.5. Determining the starting point for reading\nHaving had the orientation classified and the tag\ncorners located enable the application to start reading its\nembedded data. Reading always starts from the upper-\nleft corner of the tag. The system will be able to find\nthis point even if the tag is rotated or skewed since the\nsoftware has already flagged each coloured area corner\nwith its appropriate position in step 2: upper-left, upper-\nright, lower-left and lower-right.\n4.6. Extracting the code\nThe last step in detecting a tag performs reading the\ncode data in a similar fashion to approximating the tag\ncorners in step 4. Each tag edge is traversed between its\ntwo end points, i.e. tag corners, with one eleventh of its\nlength, as each bit block has 1cm width and 1cm height.\nThe one-eleventh ratio is applied vertically and\nhorizontally while scanning the code from top to bottom\nand from left to right. The tag is scanned line by line\nand each block\u2019s colour is retrieved to construct the data\nembedded in it.\n5. Rendering the tag content\nThe first initial step of detecting a tag in a camera\nframe is accomplished and next comes the process of\nrendering the content embedded in it onto the mobile\nphone screen. This is achieved by using the graphics\nlibrary OpenGL ES which is a cut-down version of\ndesktop OpenGL tailored to meet the limited\ncapabilities and resources on embedded systems (ES)\n[14].\nThe main concept applied here is to find 3 points on\nscreen, 2-D surface, and try to reverse-project them to\ntheir 3-D position in the 3-D world of OpenGL ES.\nOnce those 3-D points are calculated, it will be possible\nto find a transformation method that would render the\n3-D object of the ad in its appropriate perspective\nrelative to the surface the tag is placed on. The three\npoints we use for this purpose are the centre point of the\ntag, the lower-right corner and the lower-left corner.\n6. Possible difficulties\nThere are two main streams of difficulties that may\nface ARMAD: technical and social difficulties. As the\ntag design contains colours and the detection process\ndepends solely on them, it is essential to have tags well\nilluminated with white light. This is a technical issue\nwhich having failed to comply with may cause the\nSixth International Conference on the Management of Mobile Business (ICMB 2007)\n0-7695-2803-1\/07 $25.00  \u00a9 2007\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

This is a limitation of using colours in\nthe design but it comes as a trade-off to excessive\nprocessing, heavy power consumption and jittering view\nframes that other well-known AR techniques may\ngenerate when applied on mobile phones [3].\nThe unavailability of OpenGL ES on many mobile\nphones is another technical issue that may deprecate the\nusability of ARMAD. It limits at the mean time the use\nof the application to a small but considerable portion of\nthe mobile phones population, 100 million phones [15].\nHowever, with the massive industry interest in OpenGL\nES standard this is expected to be overcome or almost\nresolved in the future. A potential solution could be\nporting the application to J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition)\nwhich is a cross-platform common to most phones\nwhich suffers from reduced accuracy and performance.\nThe other category of difficulties that may be\nencountered is related to the social response to the\nsystem. Many mobile phone users are not necessarily\nwell-educated about the security and privacy issues in\nthe mobile medium and often take a conservative view\nin regards to the technology. This could have a negative\nimpact on any mobile service not only ARMAD. The\nsystem could be considered as a spam or a virus by\nusers. They might feel worried of using the system\nfearing that their personal details could be stolen or\ncompromised.\nAdd to this the concern of costs and the delivery\nmechanisms to use. With over-the-air delivery of ad\ncontent via GPRS users may be charged according to the\namount of bytes downloaded\/uploaded whilst in the\nretrieval process. This is expected to be overcome in the\nfuture when mobile operators provide flat-rate tariffs for\nwireless Internet access [16] like T-Mobile\u2019s \u2018Web &\nWalk\u2019 first-of-kind service in the UK [17] and NTT\nDoCoMo\u2019s wide range of such plan in Japan [18].\nAnother social issue relates to people getting board\nof intrusive and redundant services or ads which repel\ntheir future interaction with them. Generally, people\nenjoy experiences that when contemplate in they find\nthemselves learning or inferring something about the\nobject being represented or advertised [19]. ARMAD\naddresses this concern as it mixes adverts with rich\nmedia, 3D graphics, and new forms of interaction. It\nprovides, as a result, advertisers with an unprecedented\nopportunity to offer messages that include information\nin a supporting knowledge environment, and\nentertainment in an enjoyable format [19]. The 3D\ncontents in the ads define a virtual, psychological\nexperience that consumers undergo while interacting\nwith 3D products in computer-mediated environment\n[19].\nNevertheless, most newly introduced technological\nservices or products were considered complex and hard\nto co-op with when first put in the market (e.g.\nmicrowaves). Complexity often has negative effect on\nany product [19]. This issue applies in the advertising\nspectrum where complexity may arise from new,\ninnovative advertising services, such as ARMAD,\nbecoming more interactive and more user-interfaced.\nHowever, researchers have found that more involvement\nand more interactivity provide greater user learning\nexperience [20] and open up potentials for new dialog\nforms between marketers and consumers [21].\nAs the public gets more exposed to mobile services\nin the future opt-in advertising systems such as\nARMAD, or even opt-out, systems would become\nfamiliar to them.\n7. Usability and potential benefits\nAdvertisers are expected to spend $11 billion on\nmobile advertising by 2011 according to a recent report\nby the telecom division of Informa group [22]. However,\nmobile advertising is unlikely to be successful unless it\noffers something new and interesting for the customer.\nThe message or content should be relevant, contextual,\npermission-based, targeted, personalized, and user\nfriendly. Also, the content of the ad must be attractive\nand interactive which are the core of imaginative\nmessage design aimed at stimulating consumers\u2019\nresponses such as attention and attitude towards the ad\nor the brand, as well as behavioural activity in the\nmarket place [19]. These responses are mental imagery\nprocesses by which sensory information is represented\nin memory very like picturing and very unlike\ndescribing. With the advent of new media possibilities\non the mobile phones such as 3D graphics a new\ndimension of media-specific marketing messages can be\ncreated to stimuli this mental process by which\ncustomers translate messages into mental images that in\nturn stimulate purchase intentions [19].\nAdvertisers must realize that people seeking mobile\nservices generally have only short periods of time to\naccess such content, say while waiting for a doctor\nappointment or for a bus. That is an opportunity for\nadvertisers to communicate with these potential\ncustomers. The real communication is made only by\nmeans of attractive media-richness that are the sole of\nconveying the spontaneous, intensive perception of\nreality depicting a vivifying freshness of impressions\nreconstructed as real pictures in the mind\u2019s eye [19].\nThus, advertisers must make the most out of this little\nyet crucial time by providing something compelling,\nexciting, engaging and imaginative to attract users\u2019\nattention and provoke their acquisition or willingness to\ninteract with the ad. The experimental poser of vivid\nadverts lies in their presentation of intellectual and\nemotional complex in an instant of time [19].\nSeveral mobile advertising models and applications\nhave been introduced and tried so far in the mobile\nmarket by different companies and\/or organizations.\nMost of these models are just an inheritance from the\nInternet industry: banners have started to appear on\nmobile web pages, ad-links are being hosted on wireless\nSixth International Conference on the Management of Mobile Business (ICMB 2007)\n0-7695-2803-1\/07 $25.00  \u00a9 2007\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\nInternet searches, video clips are now pre- or post-\nbuffered with commercials, and even SMS messages\n(Short Message Service) are being sent to customers\nrandomly like email spams. Exact expectations of how\nsuccessful and efficient each medium is are still unclear.\nBut what can be said for sure is that SMS-based ads are\ncurrently the most prolific [23].\nAll of these models may already be familiar to users\nwho might already have negative impression towards\nthem from their experiences with the Internet, which\nbecame as a result arguably less-effective [24]. If they\nsee any Internet-like ad they associate it to the negative\nimpressions (schemas) related to Internet ads like\ninterfering, annoying, unwanted, etc\u2026 Studies showed\nthat individuals have media schemas and when these\nschemas do not match a given situation negative\nreaction can result. Individuals apply these schemas\nregardless of the context, for example applying the\nevaluation of Internet on Mobile phones here. The\nfindings also showed that stimuli made to resemble one\nmedium (e.g. Internet) will not perform as well when\nplaced in a different medium (e.g. mobile phones) [24].\nDifferent mediums have different features that are\nunique to them; each is organized differently, requires\nvarious levels of control, and contains distinctive\namount and kinds of content or information [25]. This\nmay affect the forward-stepping of adverts into wireless\ndevices and mobile phones which are considered the\nmost personal media channel of all. Anything intrusive,\ndull and irrelevant may damage the whole medium\nleading to a poor user experience.\nFor this specific reason original ideas that would\nalter users\u2019 perceptions must emerge if mobile\nadvertising is to proliferate. Merely porting usual and\nknown media forms may not be appropriate for mobile\nplatforms [24]. We believe that with the noticeable\nadvances in the proximity- and location-sensitiveness of\nmobile technologies alongside the expansion of wireless\nservices, well-established and directed location-based\nservices (LBS) could be the winning solution for the\nfuture of mobile business.\n7.1. ARMAD: A location-based service\nLBS provides information and services at the\nlocation most relevant to people\u2019s time, activity,\ninterests, proximity and context. ARMAD is such a\nlocation-based service which introduces a direct two-\ntier, measurable interaction process between potential\ncustomers and businesses, wrapped up with exciting and\nattractive 3D visual effects.\nARMAD differs from most other LBS solutions in\nthat it is not a push-message service. It is totally an opt-\nin solution where a customer has full control over it.\nHigher active control will produce more satisfaction for\npeople who are generally motivated to see themselves in\ncontrol of the events and situations in their lives [26].\nUsers operate ARMAD by personally dragging their\nphones to see what the tag in front of them is hiding in\nits context. It is similar to opening a present box\nexpecting something pleasant. When in action, the user\nviews 3-D models of products, animations presenting a\nproduct\/brand, human-like avatars giving commercial\ninformation, or ad-linked texts which s\/he has never\nexperienced before. This engaging and exciting content\nmay unconsciously tighten the user\u2019s relationship with\nthe brand or product being displayed on screen, or at\nleast may influence his\/her awareness. This is served for\nby with 3-D graphics and augmented content in\nARMAD. Both provide unique virtual experience that\nbrings into the customer-brand relation more\neffectiveness through the psychological states of\npresence and belonging to the proximity of the ad,\ninvolvement with its brand\/product advertised, and\nentertainment offered [20]. Studies suggest that there is\na constant connection within any medium between the\nhuman mind, the technology and the environment that\nserves to immerse users resulting in augmented\nlearning, altered behaviour, and a perceived sense of\ncontrol [27]. ARMAD addresses this by mixing users\u2019\nexperience with the physical environment and the\ncutting-edge technology.\nThe application of ARMAD can be applied in wide\narenas such as shopping centres, malls, public parks and\neven museums. In such places people are most likely\nfree and under no time pressure. This gives an\nadvantage to capture their attention and encourage them\nto interact with this entertaining ad medium, at least to\nadd more fun to their time, via the formation of the\nvirtual experience from 3D advertising [27].\n7.2. ARMAD usability scenarios\nThe method here is based on reflecting advertisers\u2019\nmessage on their customers\u2019 unconsciousness. The\nconcept is to show or deliver messages of products more\ninteractively and uniquely in such a way that is original\nand unknown to competitors via the medium perfectly\nunderstood and mostly adopted by the new generation.\nAverage revenue per person (ARPU) is not the main\nissue for success here. Rather, ARMAD is more of a\nmarketing-mix vector rather than a standalone\nmarketing method.\nViewing 3D objects on the surrounding environment\non people\u2019s mobile phones will be a lucrative and more\ninformative approach to subliminally deliver the\nqualities of products or services without forcing them on\ncustomers. They will be driven by curiosity to interact\nwith the unusual virtual scenes shown on their phones.\nBuilding on some work in psychology, many researchers\nhave suggested that in certain antecedent conditions\nconsumers may feel a heightened degree of intrinsic\nmotivation, intense concentration and enjoyment while\nengaging in technology interactions. This experience\ncould lead to many positive outcomes positive attitudes,\nSixth International Conference on the Management of Mobile Business (ICMB 2007)\n0-7695-2803-1\/07 $25.00  \u00a9 2007\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

With\nARMAD users will be twinkled with the superimposed\ncontent on the environment around them and the new\nway of engagement with brands and products, which\nwill add fun to their experiments. This indirect tapping\non emotions and the sense of absurdity offered are what\nmake customers recall ads and may drive immediate\nbehavioural action with respect to the product [24].\nIn this sense ARMAD complies with the\nrequirements stated above of entailing something\noverwhelming, informative and novel to the advertising\nexperience customers pass through which stimulates\ncuriosity [24]. For them it will be amusing, new, eye-\ncatchy and fun, while for advertisers it will be\ndistinguishing, distributable, manageable, and widely\nprofitable.\n7.3. Distribution models\nHaving discussed the technology behind ARMAD\nand shed some light on how it is meant to operate to\nmake the most effect, we propose here two models of\nhow to distribute the application among the public.\n7.3.1. Packaged with operator-branded mobile\nphones: many operators ship mobile phones branded\nwith their logos and special content and\/or applications.\nHaving ARMAD shipped with such packages can open\nthe door for wider spectrum of cooperation between\noperators and the different poles in the mobile business\ncompetition. It would drive more revenue to partners\nand would make the application locally standardized if\nnot globally. A good example of this is the QR barcode\nreader provided by the Japanese operator NTT\nDoCoMo. Almost all phones by the operator are shipped\nwith the capability to reading such codes and any one\ncan create customized codes with the publicly available\nutilities provided by NTT DoCoMo [28].\n7.3.2. Location-based: another option of distribution\ncould be using a back-end system that would send\nARMAD manually or automatically to client phones.\nUsers may request the download of the application over\nthe air by typing special short-code number(s),\nadvertised in the appropriate locations, where they\nwould view and interact with visual ads. Or, they may\nrequest downloading it from a server in the proximity\nvia Bluetooth, or other wireless technologies once\nimplemented.\nIn order to have the application sent automatically to\nphones a dedicated back-end server and central database\nare needed to track the IDs of phones that have\npreviously downloaded the application. If a phone in the\nproximity is discovered and found not to be registered in\nthe database it will receive a message recommending\nthe download.  However, this method can be costy and\nmay be disturbing to customers. It would also contradict\nwhat has been discussed earlier about user-privacy. It\nmay in addition require a nationwide management\nwhich in tern costs time and money.\n8. Conclusion\nMobile ads by being personal, creative and intimate\ncould solve some of the frustration advertisers have with\ncustomers ignoring other traditional advertising\nformats. However, this interactive medium unlike others\nhas a complex and sophisticated infrastructure for\nmanagement, delivery and optimization of\nadvertisements. Also, its personal nature is both a plus\nand a minus. It involves creating exciting chances to\ntalk directly to customers via highly tailored messages.\nOn the other hand it could be intrusive and irrelevant\nand would be discarder by customers causing the\nmedium to be alienated and destroyed. We believe that\ninteractive and entertaining LBS systems will have the\ngreatest impact of all mobile marketing techniques on\ncustomers\u2019 experiences and businesses\u2019 logistic\nmarketing mixes and although this project is in the\nearly stage of evolution it highlights the potential of the\nfield..\n9.
