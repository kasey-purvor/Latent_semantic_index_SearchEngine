We begin by describing the wavelet \nproperties that are most important for image \ncompression. In particular, we present a method to \nconstruct bi-orthogonal wavelets and their Finite \u20acmpulse \nResponse (FIR) filter banks.

Using our hyttrid \nalgorithm, the data \nwas maintained w i b  a \nPeak Signal-to-PWse Ratio (PSNR) of approximahly \n26dB while achieving a compression ratio of 150:l. \nNTRODUCTION \nDue to the vast mount  of digital images associated with \nsatellite remote sensing, image compression has became a \nkey technology for &e transmission and storage of satellite \nimages. In the past ten years, the spatial and \nresolutions of satetlite remote sensing have \nsignificantly. The wed  for more efficient data c \nthe remote sensing community. \nnumerous applications in speech and image \nprocessing. But the blocking effects of VQ have restricted the \napplication of VQ codes in satellite image compression. \nThe tppic of \u201cwavelet analysis\u201d has recently atmsted \nmuch attention from both mathematicians and engineers. \nWavelet theory has found applications in areas such as image \nanalysis, communication systems, biomedical imaging, radar, \n~ \nand control systems. However, many literatures associated \nwith wavelets require that the reader has a good knowledge in \nboth functional analysis and group representation theory. The \napplication of bi-orthogonal wavelets to construct linear \nphase FIR filter pairs is presented in this paper. Using these \nFIR filters, the satellite image is first transformed into the \ntime-frequency domain. A combination of VQ and ADPCM \nalgorithms is then used to achieve very low bit-rate \ncompression. image reconstruction is performed using the \ninverse wavelet transform. As VQ performs image coding in \ndifferent sub-bands, blocking efforts in satellite images are \nalso minimized. \nCONSTRUCTION O F  BI-ORTHOGONAL WAVELET \nBASIS AND ITS FIR FILTER BANK \nWavelet transform is a new 2-D time-frequency signal \nanalysis method. Haar described the first wavelet basis back \nin 1910. In the 1980s, many researchers [\u2018I performed \npioneering work into wavelets, particularly in multi- \nresolution and fast wavelet transforms resulting in numerous \nsignal processing applications. \nThe frame of multi-resolution analysis is to generate a \nclosed subspaces (V,,,} and (W,} in theL2(R) space. The \nfunctions @,?(t) are the regular orthogonal basis of the \nsubspace (V,} and wavelets ~ , , , , ~ ( t )  are used to construct the \nsubspace (W,}, and m E Z .  They have the following \nproperties: \nThere exists two sequences ( p k }  and {qk}  E l2  such that \nVm-\u2019-wm vm+l = vm + Wvi \n#(x> = c P k 4 ( 2 x  - k )  \ndx) = c q k # ( 2 x  - k ,  \nk \nk \nNormally, we call the unique sequence ( P , ~ }  that relates \n@ ( x )  with the functions 4(2x - k), k E 2 \u201ctwo-scale \nfunction\u201d, its Z-transform is H ( z ) .  For an orthogonal \nwavelet transform, H ( z )  satisfies \n1 H ( z )  l 2  + 1 H ( - z )  1 2 =  1 , where I z )= 1 . \n0-7803-5207-6199\/$1 2051 \nAlthough orthogonal analysis is very good in signal \nprocessing, The basis of orthogonal wavelet transform is \ngenerally neither compact nor continuous. That is, it is not \neasy to design linear FIR filters based on orthogonal \nwavelets. In order to apply a wavelet transform in image \nprocessing requires linear phase FIR filters. In this paper, bi- \northogonal wavelets are considered. Bi-orthogonal wavelets \nmean that two multi-resolution analyses {V,} ,{Wm} and \n{y,} , {E,} satisfy the following condition: \nV\/#LE, , Fm1wm \nThis means that their Z-transforms satisijJ21 : \n&I2  P\u201d \nFn 456164 \n1 H ( z )  11 g ( z )  I + 1 H(- t )  11 2(-z) 1 = 1, where I z )= 1 . \nJzf4 0 0 0 \n16&\/64 -&I8 -3&\/64 3 f i l 1 2 8 \u2018  \nDuring the design of a wavelet filter, several important \npoints must be taken into consideration. Among them are: \nlength of the filter, computational complexity and efficiency, \nsimplicity in implementation, smoothness and symmetry of \nthe basic wavelet, and the order of approximation. \nIn our approach, we design bi-orthogonal wavelet filters \nwith B-splines. B-splines are multi-resolution scaling \nfunctions and the support is compact. In general, B-splines \ncould generate a multi-resolution basis of L2 (R) , and \nconsequent1 the B-splines would satisfy the two-scale \nrelationship &: \nN \nn=O \n(where N ,  ( t )  is a B-spline function) \nIts Fourier transform is: \nGrn (2w) = H(w).  rj\u201d, (U) \nTherefore, for m-2, p2g  could be obtained using the \ninverse Fourier transform: \nP2,o = f i  f 4 , p2,l = &f 2 , p2,2 = \nAfter we get the H(w)  , E(@) can be obtained using: \nH(w) * 2(-w)  = \nSubstituting N=3, R(w) = 0=0 and H(w) , \nE(-@) = (yTp 1 + c o s 0  + 32 1-cosw + (,)\u2019I 1-cosw \nThen, the wavelet transform FIR filter pairs c& be \nobtained as shown in Tablel: (m=2, m\u2019=4). Fig1 shows \nI H(w)  I versus w .  Similarly, other FIR filter pairs can be \nobtained from Tables 2. All these filter banks have the \nfollowing important characteristics: \n0 \nHigh efficiency. \nLinearphase. \n0 Exact reconstruction of signal. \nThey satisfy the bi-wavelet analysis conditions. \nTheir bases are compact support and continuous. \nThese characteristics are very useful in transforming an \nimage to time-frequency domain. Now, let us employ them \ninto satellite image compression. \nTablel: Bi-orthogonal Wavelet FIR Filter Pair ( m=2, m \u2019 4 )  \nn 0 I 41 I + 2  I + 3  I +4 I \nTablel: Bi-orthogonal Wavelet FIR Filter Pair ( m=2, m\u2019=2) \nn 0 1 2 3 4 \n0 \nSATELLITE IMAGE COMPRESSION \nThe objective of digital image compression is to minimize \nthe number of bits required to represent an image, while \nmaintaining acceptable image quality. \nThe statistics of an image will change after a wavelet \ntransformation. Applying a low-pass wavelet filter several \ntimes would result in the coarse components becoming highly \ncorrelated and ideally suited for ADPCM. However, the pixel \nvalues associated with the detail components of the image \nwould suffer from random reduction of magnitude. \nTherefore, another method is needed to compress these high \nfrequency components. \nVector Quantization is a good method to compress images \nto very low bit rates. The blocking effects of a VQ decoded \nimage, however, limits the application of VQ coding in \nimages, especially in satellite image compression. There are \ntwo methods to improve the overall image quality with VQ \ncoding: one is to optimize the quality of the designed \ncodebooks; the other is to improve the data statistics for \nvector quantization. \nSatellite images have typically different statistical \nparameters; it is almost impossible to get common codebooks \nto satisfy all of them. DCT and FFT are two methods that can \nbe used to convert images from the spatial domain to the \nfrequency domain to improve their statistical characteristics, \nbut both of them could not keep any spatial information \n(unless sub-block is used, but it will cause the blocking \neffect). \n2052 \nWavelet image analysis offers the opportunity followed by a VQ coding for the detail components. A \ncompression ratio of 15O:l is used and Fig2 shows the \nreconstructed image with PSNR = 25.88dB. \ncompress the images at different scales and subbands.
