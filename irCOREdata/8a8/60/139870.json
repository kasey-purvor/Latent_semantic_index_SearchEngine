Introduction \nStructural impact or fracture events are associated with the generation of acoustic stress \nwaves, typically in a frequency range between 100 kHz and a few MHz. Acoustic-emission \n(AE) detection has been established as one of the main non-destructive testing techniques for \nmonitoring structural health and integrity [1-4]. For airframe and large civil structures in \nparticular, the monitoring of impacts and damage using the AE detection method is important \nfor safety and cost reduction [1, 4]. Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) strain sensors have \nconsiderable advantages over conventional piezoelectric sensors, such as immunity to \nelectromagnetic interference, ease of installation and multiplexing capability. Different \ntechniques employing FBGs to detect AE have been demonstrated [2-7]. A minimum \ndetectable dynamic strain in the order of 10 nanostrain has been demonstrated for sensors \nusing passive FBGs [3, 4]. Higher strain sensitivity at a few 100 Hz was obtained using a pi-\nphase shifted FBG which was interrogated with a tuneable laser [7]. The maximum \nmeasurable AE frequency using this technique is limited by the frequency scanning speed of \nthe tuneable laser.  \n \nAE detection using fibre grating lasers offers not only the advantages associated with FBG \nsensors, but also the potential to measure AE signals with much higher sensitivities than FBG \nsensors [8-12]. The linewidth of fibre lasers is typically a few tens of kHz, corresponding to a \ncoherence length of the order of tens of km. In this sensor configuration, the AE signals \n3    05\/01\/2007    4:47 PM \nperturb the laser cavity thus modulating the lasing frequency which can be measured using a \npath length imbalanced readout Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Since the laser linewidth \nis narrow, a long path length can be used and high AE sensitivity can be realised. For \nexample, an axial strain sensitivity of 10-14 \/\u221aHz at 7 kHz using a single mode distributed \nBragg reflector (DBR) Er3+-doped fibre laser has been reported [8]. Distributed feedback \n(DFB) fibre grating lasers provide more robust single frequency operation without mode-\nhopping [13], and are expected to offer better performance for AE sensing. The high acoustic \nsensitivity also provides the possibility of using DFB fibre lasers as compact optical fibre \nhydrophones in sonar applications [10-12]. \n \nWe have observed that the output power of a DFB fibre laser is sensitive to ultrasonic waves \nthat impinge on the laser cavity, in particular when the vibration frequencies are close to the \nrelaxation oscillation frequency of the laser [14]. A weak AE signal either initiates a \nrelaxation oscillation of the laser, or modulates the laser output power with the same \nfrequency as the AE signal. Therefore, the ultrasonic waves can be detected by directly \nmonitoring the laser output power.  \n \nIn this paper we report the development of AE sensors based on Yb3+\/Er3+-codoped DFB \n(YbEr-DFB) fibre grating lasers. The response of the fibre laser to ultrasonic Lamb waves \ngenerated in a 3-mm thick aluminium plate has been investigated. Two sensor configurations \nhave been investigated. (1), a path length imbalanced readout Mach-Zehnder interferometer \nwas used to measure the laser frequency shift induced by ultrasonic vibration. (2), the \ndetection of ultrasonic waves by directly monitoring the laser output power.  \n \n2. YbEr-DFB fibre grating laser  \nFigure 1 shows a schematic of the YbEr-DFB fibre laser deployed for AE detection. The laser \nhead was a phase-shifted FBG written into an Yb3+\/Er3+-codoped fibre (Koheras, C15). The \nlength of the grating was 5 cm, and was recoated with polyimide to a diameter of 155 \u00b5m. \nStandard telecommunication fibre was spliced to one or both sides of the doped fibre, \napproximately 5 mm from the grating ends. A 977 nm fibre pigtailed solid state pump laser \nwas coupled into the Yb3+\/Er3+-codoped fibre through a 980\/1550 nm fibre wavelength \ndivision multiplexer (WDM). Two YbEr-DFB fibre lasers were investigated, operating at \nwavelengths of 1549.7 (YbEr-DFB-1) and 1548.0 (YbEr-DFB-2) nm. The laser output was \n4    05\/01\/2007    4:47 PM \nseparated from the pump light through the WDM and was measured after a polarisation-\ninsensitive optical fibre isolator FI-1. \n \nPart of the fibre containing the phase-shifted FBG must be placed on a heat sink to dissipate \nthe heat from the self-heating due to pump laser absorption. The laser output was monitored \nusing a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer with 80 MHz resolution. The laser was observed \nto lase on two orthogonally polarised modes, separated by approximately 1.49 GHz. When the \nfibre of the first laser YbEr-DFB-1 was twisted by approximately 180o over the 10 cm long \nfibre section containing the phase-shifted FBG, the laser operated in a single polarisation \nmode [15]. Using the delayed self-heterodyne method [16] with a 2 km fibre delay line, the \nlinewidth of the laser was measured to be 100 kHz, limited by the measurement resolution.  \n \nSingle polarisation mode operation was also achieved by separating part of laser YbEr-DFB-2 \nfrom the heat sink and not twisting the fibre. A possible reason for this is that the non-uniform \ndistribution of temperature along the fibre made the lasing conditions more favourable for one \nof the orthogonally polarised modes than the other. It is beyond the scope of this paper to \ndiscuss the laser mechanisms in more detail.      \n \nThe measured laser output powers and relative intensity noise spectra are shown in Figure 2.  \nThe noise spectra recorded using a RF spectrum analyser with a bandwidth of 3 kHz for \ndifferent pump powers are shown in Figure 2(a). The background noise spectrum of the \nphotoreceiver (Pp=0) was recorded when the pump laser was turned off. The laser relaxation \noscillation frequency increases as the pump power increases. In Figure 2 (b), the peak \nfrequency of relaxation oscillation and laser power output from the isolator FI-1 are plotted \nagainst pump power for the two lasers. The threshold pump power was less than 10 mW. The \nsingle frequency laser power was greater than 0.5 mW and 1.0 mW respectively for the two \nlasers for 20 mW of pump power, demonstrating that YbEr-DFB fibre lasers are more \nefficient than DFB fibre lasers using Er3+-doped fibre. Such a high power signal source is an \nadvantage for constructing the sensor system for high frequency measurement as the \nphotoreceiver amplifier can be optimised for high frequency without the requirement for high \ngain.  \n \n3. AE sensing experiment  \n5    05\/01\/2007    4:47 PM \nFigure 3 shows the configuration of the AE sensing experiment using an YbEr-DFB fibre \nlaser. An YbEr-DFB laser was placed on an aluminium plate, that was 3 mm thick and with \nlateral dimensions of 50x50 cm2.  \n \n3.1. Generation of ultrasonic lamb waves in an aluminium plate \nUltrasonic waves were generated by a piezoelectric pressure transducer (PA-g) (Physical \nAcoustics, model: WD), which was driven directly by a synthesized function generator \nwithout using an RF amplifier. The vibration was coupled to the aluminium plate using a \nperspex wedge with the wedge angle approximately equal to the critical angle for the interface \nbetween perspex and aluminium (\u03b8= 25o), so that shear waves propagation is dominant in the \naluminium plate [17]. In general the ultrasonic waves generated interact in a complex manner \nwith the laser sensor. To simplify interpretation of the signals, the vibration frequency was \nkept below 500 kHz, so that the frequency-thickness product is smaller than 1.5 MHz\u00b7mm and \nthe ultrasonic wave in the aluminium plate could be approximately treated as a zero order \nmode Lamb wave, i.e. antisymmetric mode A0 and symmetric mode S0 [17]. \n \n3.2. Coupling of vibration from the aluminium plate to the laser \nWhen the ultrasonic vibration was generated in the aluminium plate, the laser frequency shift \nand power change results from the vibration-induced perturbations in the laser cavity. In our \npreliminary experiments [14], the entire length of YbEr-DFB laser was placed on an \naluminium plate using two pieces of 5 mm wide tape. However, the laser also responds when \nonly part of the laser is exposed to the ultrasonic vibration. This allows high spatial resolution \nsensing. As shown in Figure 1, a layer of lens tissue was used as the AE isolation layer. The 3 \nmm long sensing element of the DFB laser was covered by a layer of lens tissue and held on \nthe plate using a piece of tape. Vacuum grease was used to improve the coupling between the \nfibre and the aluminium plate surface.  \n \n3.3. Measurement of Lamb wave induced laser frequency shift  \nThe laser output was divided into two using a 50:50 fibre coupler after the fibre isolator FI-1. \nA path length imbalanced readout MZI was used to measure the laser frequency shift induced \nby ultrasonic vibration. The optical path difference (OPD) of the MZI was 125 m. An acousto-\noptic modulator (AOM) was connected in one of the MZI arms to introduce a frequency shift \nof 34.98 MHz and enable heterodyne signal processing. A polarization controller was used to \n6    05\/01\/2007    4:47 PM \nensure that the polarization states in the two arms were matched. The two outputs from the \nMZI were detected using a balanced photoreceiver, and then processed by either a 100MHz 8-\nbit digitising card and computer, or a digital oscilloscope \/ RF spectrum analyzer. The use of a \nbalanced photoreceiver minimises the laser power modulation signal when the two outputs of \nthe MZI are approximately equal. The laser output from the second port of fibre coupler C1 \nwas simultaneously monitored using a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. \n \nA second piezoelectric pressure transducer (PA-s) positioned 10 mm from the centre of the \nYbEr-DFB laser was used to detect the Lamb waves, providing an independent measurement \nfor the Lamb waves at the approximate location of the DFB laser. The output signal from PA-\ns was amplified by a pre-amplifier (A1), then by the amplifier (A2). PA-s and PA-g were the \nsame type of pressure transducers. Vacuum grease was used to improve the coupling between \nthe piezoelectric transducers and the aluminium plate surface. \n \nFigure 4 shows the phase spectrum of the fibre laser recorded from the output of MZI using a \nspectrum analyser. The first peak at frequency f0=34.98 MHz resulted from the AOM. The \nlower peak at (f0 + 320) kHz corresponds to the laser noise. The peak at (f0 + 470) kHz \nappeared when the vibration at 470 kHz was generated in the aluminium plate.         \n \nIn order to estimate the laser sensitivity to the Lamb waves, it is appropriate to assume that the \nout-of-plane displacement was dominant on the surface for the test signal at 470 kHz. This \napproximation was made since the amplitude ratio of the out-of plane displacement to the in-\nplane displacement of the A0 mode on the surface of a 3 mm thick aluminium plate was \napproximately 1.5, and the ratio of the out-of plane displacement of the A0 mode to the in-\nplane displacement of the S0 mode was approximately 6 [17]. In addition, since the fibre was \nnot bonded to the plate, the coupling coefficient for in-plane-displacement between the fibre \nand the plate must be lower than that for out-of-plane displacement.  \n \nThe out-of plane displacement on the plate surface associated with the test ultrasonic wave \npropagating in the aluminium plate was approximately 3x10-11 m, based on measurements \nusing a single point laser Doppler vibrometer (Polytec, OFV-3001\/303\/OVD-02). The \nminimum detectable velocity was 0.5 \u00b5m\/s, corresponding to a displacement of 2x10-13 m at \n7    05\/01\/2007    4:47 PM \n470 kHz. The minimum detectable out-of plane displacement measured using fibre laser was \n1.5x10-13 m, corresponding to a resolution of 3x10-15 m\/\u221aHz.  \n \n3.4. Measurement of Lamb wave induced laser power modulation \nThe laser output power was found to respond directly to the ultrasonic Lamb waves. Figure 5 \nshows the response of the YbEr-DFB laser and PA-s sensor to the ultrasonic waves generated \nby the piezoelectric transducer, PA-g. The voltage applied to PA-g was a sine wave at 250 \nkHz (Figure 3(a)). The output from PA-s and from the YbEr-DFB-2 laser are shown in Figure \n5 (b) and (c) respectively. The output power of the laser is modulated at the same frequency as \nthat of the ultrasonic wave.  The laser power variation possibly results from the vibration \ninduced perturbation of the value of the phase shift constant of the DFB laser. Quantifying this \nresult with the underlying physics is the subject of further research. \n \n3.4.1. Effects of pump power \nThe vibration induced laser power modulation was observed to be strongly frequency \ndependent. Since the vibration amplitude of the transducer, the vibration coupling loss from \nthe transducer to the aluminium plate and the properties of Lamb waves in the plate depend \nstrongly on frequency, it is complex to measure the vibration amplitude coupled to the laser as \na function of frequency. The operation state of the YbEr-DFB laser itself has a strong effect \non its response to ultrasonic waves. Since the laser relaxation oscillation frequency increases \nas the pump power increases, the laser sensitivity will be different for the same test vibration \nsignal if the pump power is varied. Therefore, the laser output power was measured for \ndifferent pump powers at the same ultrasonic frequency.  \n \nWhen an ultrasonic wave at 340 kHz was generated in the plate, the relative intensity noise \nspectrum of YbEr-DFB-2 was measured for different pump powers using an RF spectrum \nanalyser. The voltage amplitude applied to the transducer PA-g was 5 V. Figure 6 shows the \nmeasured spectrum for a pump power of 23 mW. The peak frequency of relaxation oscillation, \nfr, was 476 kHz. The peak at 340 kHz results from the laser response to the test ultrasonic \nwave. The signal to noise ratio (S\/N) at the test frequency was 27 dB, which can be used as \nthe characteristic sensitivity of the laser to the ultrasonic wave. In figure 7, the measured S\/N \nat 340 kHz is plotted against peak relaxation oscillation frequency, fr, which increased with \npump power. The S\/N increased as fr increased. With such laser sensitivity dependency on \n8    05\/01\/2007    4:47 PM \npump power, the laser sensor can be tuned to optimise the measurement of vibrations in a \nspecified frequency range.       \n \n3.4.2. Laser response to a tone burst  \nThe DFB fibre laser can be used to monitor the transient AE signals on the surface of the \naluminium plate. Figure 8 shows the response to a 5-cycle sine tone burst at 250 kHz. PA-g \nwas 18 cm away from the centre of the DFB sensing section.  \n \nThe group velocities of A0 and S0 modes at 250 kHz in an aluminium plate are 3.0 km\/s and \n5.3 km\/s respectively [17]. The approximate 51 \u00b5s delay before either PA-s or the fibre laser \nresponds to the tone burst corresponds to the time taken for the A0 mode to propagate to the \nsensors. The size and shape of the sensing area for each sensor type are very different. The \noptical fibre has a cylindrical shape and therefore very little is in direct contact with the \nsurface of the plate and has an interaction area at least two orders of magnitude less than the \npiezoelectric sensor (approximately 1mm2 compared to 250mm2). It is therefore probable that \nalthough the response of the two sensor types will be similar in form they will differ in detail. \nFrom these results it appears that the laser sensor has comparable sensitivity to the \npiezoelectric device, but when normalised for sensing area the fibre laser has much higher \nsensitivity. This issue will be the subject of future investigation. \n \n3.4.3.  Low energy impact detection \nThe laser response to impacts generated by dropping a steel ball is shown in Figure 9. The ball \nof 4.7 mm diameter and 0.43 g in weight was dropped from a height of 7 cm above the \nhorizontal aluminium plate, corresponding to an initial impact energy of 0.3 mJ. The impact \nlocation on the plate was 15 cm from the centre of the YbEr-DFB-1 fibre laser on an \naluminium plate of 13 x 50 x 0.3 cm3. The subsequent bursts of laser power shown in Figure 9 \nresulted from the bouncing of the ball on the plate. The impacts occurring after the ball has \nbounced were weaker than the initial one, indicated by the smaller amplitude and shorter \nduration of the bursts of the laser power. Such a high sensitivity to impact could have \napplications in composite structures where the AE attenuation is very high. \n \n4.  Conclusions \n9    05\/01\/2007    4:47 PM \nYbEr-DFB fibre lasers have been used to detect ultrasonic Lamb waves generated in an \naluminium plate. The vibration frequency was kept below 500 kHz, so that the ultrasonic \nwave in the 3 mm thick aluminium plate could be approximately treated as a zero order mode \nLamb wave. \n \nA path length imbalanced readout Mach-Zehnder interferometer was used to measure the laser \nfrequency shift induced by ultrasonic vibration. The use of a balanced photoreceiver \nminimises the effects of laser power modulation. The out-of-plane displacement resolution \nwas 3 x10-15 m\/\u221aHz for a continuous ultrasonic wave at a frequency of 470 kHz.  \n \nWe have demonstrated that the output power of an YbEr-DFB fibre laser can be modulated by \nthe ultrasonic waves generated in an aluminium plate, which has been exploited to develop an \nalternative method for AE sensing. By directly monitoring the laser power, the sensor system \nconfiguration has been considerably simplified. Since the laser sensitivity to the vibration \ndepends on the pump power, the laser sensor can be tuned to suite the measurement of \nvibrations at a specified frequency range. This simplified configuration is useful for transient \nAE signals. The detection of low energy impacts has been demonstrated, indicating the \npotential for applications in composite structures where the AE attenuation is high.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \n(EPSRC), UK and the Royal Society, UK.
