Fundamental to any description of axonemal beating is an understanding of the significance of the central pair microtubules and the degree to which central pair rotation has a role. However, for the majority of organisms, it is unclear whether the central pair actually rotates. Using an extra-axonemal structure as a fixed reference, we analysed the orientation of the central pair in African trypanosomes and other kinetoplastid protozoa. A geometric correction allowed the superposition of data from many cross-sections, demonstrating that the axis of the central pair is invariant and that there is no central pair rotation in these organisms.

Although\na variety of microtubule arrangements exist in motile flagella,\nthe canonical axoneme \u2013 the structure most widespread and\nalmost certainly ancestral to all others (Cavalier-Smith, 2002;\nCavalier-Smith and Chao, 2003) \u2013 consists of nine microtubule\ndoublets symmetrically arranged in a circle around a central\npair (CP) of singlet microtubules (the so-called 9+2\narrangement). This structure is anchored at the proximal end\nby a basal body containing triplet microtubules in a 9+0\narrangement. Dynein arms are attached to the A-tubule of each\ndoublet such that their motor head domains are in close\nproximity to the B-tubule of the neighbouring doublet\n(Gibbons and Gibbons, 1973; Gibbons and Rowe, 1965).\nActivation of the dynein motors causes a sliding force between\nadjacent doublets (Sale and Satir, 1977). Because the\nmicrotubules are constrained at the basal body and along their\nlength, this force is translated into an axonemal bend. This is\nthe fundamental force of axonemal motion.\nFrom even such a basic description of axonemal action, one\ncan recognise the need for three kinds of regulation of dynein\nactivation to create a productive axonemal beat. (1)\nAsymmetric activation: given the symmetry of the outer\ndoublets, the dynein arms on one side must be active while\nthose on the other are quiescent to generate a productive bend.\n(2) Co-operative activation: a bend of any significant length\nrequires the simultaneous (in)activation of many dynein\nmolecules along that stretch of axoneme. (3) Dynamic\nactivation: the propagation of a bend along the axoneme\nrequires that dyneins in a particular axonemal region be\ncoherently switched between active and inactive states.\nOne model for the regulation of dynein activation is based\non evidence that indicates a core role for the CP microtubules.\nIn this model, signal from an asymmetric CP apparatus\n(consisting of the two singlet microtubules C1 and C2, and\nassociated structures such as the CP bridge and CP projections)\nis transduced through the radial spokes, to a doublet-associated\nregulatory complex, which modifies dynein activity through\nthe action of dynein-associated protein kinases and\nphosphatases (Porter and Sale, 2000; Smith and Yang, 2004).\nIn support of this model, asymmetric contacts between radial\nspokes and CP projections have been seen in molluscan gill\ncilia (Warner and Satir, 1974), suggesting that radial spokes\nmight detach and reattach to the CP projections during\nmicrotubule sliding. In Chlamydomonas, CP mutants are\nparalysed yet retain the ability to undergo microtubule sliding;\ntheir defect is therefore not in the force-generating mechanism\nbut in a control system that regulates force generation\n(reviewed by Smith and Lefebvre, 1997).\nThe CP signal transduction model is particularly significant\nin the context of CP rotation. It has been postulated that\nrotation of an asymmetric CP could, through interactions\nbetween one set of CP projections and radial spokes, regulate\nProductive beating of eukaryotic flagella and cilia requires\na strict regulation of axonemal dynein activation.\nFundamental to any description of axonemal beating is\nan understanding of the significance of the central pair\nmicrotubules and the degree to which central pair rotation\nhas a role. However, for the majority of organisms, it is\nunclear whether the central pair actually rotates. Using an\nextra-axonemal structure as a fixed reference, we analysed\nthe orientation of the central pair in African trypanosomes\nand other kinetoplastid protozoa.

By contrast, associations made by the opposing CP\nmicrotubule would ensure that dyneins on the opposite side of\nthe axoneme were inactive. The CP would then act as a\ndistributor of regulatory signals around the axoneme.\nCP rotation during beating of flagella and cilia has been\ndemonstrated by thin-section electron microscopy in\nChlamydomonas and Paramecium. Longitudinal sectioning\nthrough Chlamydomonas flagella that were fixed during active\nswimming revealed the orientation of the CP microtubules as\nbeing parallel to the bend plane within the principal bend, then\ngradually twisting through 180\u00b0 until once again being parallel\nto the bend plane within the reverse bend (Mitchell, 2003). In\nfact, the CP assumes a natural left-handed helix when separated\nfrom the rest of the axoneme by detergent (Goodenough and\nHeuser, 1985) and protease treatments (Hosokawa and Miki-\nNoumura, 1987). It thus seems reasonable to accept that the\nCP is also helical inside the native axoneme, and that rotation\nof the helix through successive waves allows the CP to reorient\nsuch that one of the two CP microtubules is always at the\noutside of the bend. However, this CP rotation is independent\nof both dynein activation (as it also occurs in curved, quiescent\nflagella) and also spoke head association (as it occurs during\nbend propagation in spoke head mutants) (Mitchell and\nNakatsugawa, 2004). Hence, CP orientation is a passive\nresponse to bend formation in Chlamydomonas.\nCP orientation in Paramecium cilia is also parallel to the plane\nof bending, and it rotates 360\u00b0 during each beat cycle in forward\nand backward swimming (Omoto and Kung, 1979; Omoto and\nKung, 1980). Serial thin sections also revealed the CP left-\nhanded twist along the Paramecium axoneme. In contrast to\nChlamydomonas quiescent flagella, paralysed paramecia do not\nshow CP rotation (Omoto and Kung, 1980). Therefore, rather\nthan being a passive process, rotation of the CP in Paramecium\nmight be an active one, initiated or constantly driven by a\nmechanism other than bending, with the orientation of the CP\ndetermining the pattern of active sliding around the axoneme\n(Omoto and Kung, 1980). It is worth noting that both\nChlamydomonas and Paramecium rotate their CP tubules\nclockwise when viewed from the base of the flagellum.\nHowever, CP rotation is not ubiquitous in axonemal beating.\nIn both ctenophore comb plate cilia and echinoderm sperm\nJournal of Cell Science 119 (12)\nflagella, the CP apparatus has a fixed orientation relative to the\nposition of active sliding (Sale, 1986; Tamm and Tamm, 1981).\nFor most organisms, it is not yet clear if the CP rotates. This\nis largely a result of the difficulties in ultra-structural analyses\nof imposing an absolute frame of reference onto the ninefold\nsymmetric doublets of the axoneme, making it problematic to\nperceive a change in the axis of the CP relative to the doublets.\nThis situation is considerably eased in kinetoplastid protozoa\nowing to the presence in the flagellum of a characteristic extra-\naxonemal structure \u2013 the paraflagellar rod (PFR). Here, we use\nthis structure as an external reference to address the orientation\nof the CP in the flagella of several kinetoplastid species. We\nshow that there is no CP rotation and use a simple geometric\ncorrection technique to produce an accurate estimate of the\nangle of the CP axis in Trypanosoma brucei from a large\nnumber of axonemal cross-sections. We also present a first\nexamination of the causes of this constraint using RNA\ninterference (RNAi) to deplete particular flagellar and basal\nbody proteins specifically.\nResults\nFixed CP orientation in T. brucei\nIn Kinetoplastida, the PFR runs alongside the axoneme for\nmost of its length (Fuge, 1969; Gull, 1999). Importantly, the\nPFR is fixed relative to the axoneme, being permanently\nconnected to a set of four outer doublets (Gull, 1999). The PFR\ntherefore acts as a reference, allowing unambiguous\nidentification of CP orientation to an external axis within the\nflagellum.\nTo determine the CP orientation in the kinetoplastid flagella,\nwe analysed 40 randomly selected thin-section transmission\nelectron micrographs showing cross-sections of axonemes\nfrom motile procyclic-form T. brucei. Most micrographs\nshowing near \u2018transverse\u2019 sections through an axoneme cannot\nbe directly superimposed because there is inevitably a slight\n(and often a substantial) discrepancy between the angle of the\nsection and the true transverse plane. The result is an apparent\ndeformation of the axoneme (Fig. 1A). To compensate for\naxonemal cross-sections not being true perpendicular sections,\nwe used a mathematical transformation that moves the data\ninto the transverse plane (Fig. 1B; detailed in Materials and\nMethods). Fig. 1C shows how this transformation can be used\nFig. 1. (A) An elliptical section\nis formed if a perfect cylinder\nwith longitudinal axis z\u0004, is cut\nat an angle \u0005 to the x\u0004y\u0004 plane.\n(B) The ellipse can be\ntransposed onto the x\u0004y\u0004 plane\nby a transformation, T\u0005, to\ngenerate a true transverse\nsection.

The circularity of\nthe transformed dataset can be demonstrated by ninefold\nrotation of the corrected image, showing superposition of the\ndoublets of the axoneme (Fig. 1D).\nWe should note that this ellipse-correction procedure would\nalso erroneously \u2018correct\u2019 any symmetric deformation of the\naxoneme in a true transverse section caused by bending forces.\nHowever, since the transformation is applied only once, it\ncannot correct for both a symmetric deformation and a\nglancing section. Since there is very little eccentricity in the\ntransformed dataset (Fig. 1C), whereas the original cross-\nsections were often highly elliptical (eccentricities up to 0.8;\ni.e. the ellipse long axis is nearly twice that of the short axis),\nit is unlikely that deformation of the axoneme as a result of\nbeating is large in these micrographs when compared with\neccentricity as a result of sectional plane. Bending waves can\nbe clearly seen in the fixed flagella when interrogated by light\nmicroscopy (data not shown).\nFollowing transformation of the data from the micrographs,\nthe positions of all of the microtubules are extremely constant\nfrom axoneme to axoneme (Fig. 2A) and fall on the points\npredicted on the basis of perfect ninefold symmetry. Using the\nPFR as an external reference to define the doublet number (by\nbeing attached to doublets 4-7), the axis of the CP also has a\nvery constant orientation at 92.7\u00b10.5\u00b0 (mean \u00b1 s.e.m.) to the\naxis defined by the centre of the axoneme and doublet 1 (Fig.\n2A,B). Thus, the orientation of the CP does not vary with\nrespect to the nine outer doublets. Since this dataset comprises\ncross-sections through axonemes of many different cells and at\ndifferent positions along the cell, this provides strong evidence\nfor a fixed, specific orientation for the CP in T. brucei,\nprecluding CP rotation in this species. We therefore propose\nthat the mechanism by which the CP might rotate with respect\nto the outer nine doublet microtubules in some species does not\noperate in trypanosomes.\nFixed CP orientation in other Trypanosomatidae\nIn T. brucei, the single flagellum is physically attached to the\ncell body along most of its length through the flagellum\nattachment zone, a precise system of membrane connections,\nfilaments and specialised microtubules (Gull, 1999). However,\nthe trypanosomatids in general can display attached, partially\nattached and free flagella, all of which possess the external\nreference of the PFR. We next asked whether the fixed\norientation of the CP in the axonemes of T. brucei was specific\nto this species, or indeed life-cycle stage, or if it was common\nto other species and cell types.\nThe same geometric correction demonstrated in Fig. 1 for\nprocyclic-form T. brucei axonemes was performed on\nbloodstream-form T. brucei cells. These two life-cycle stages\nmove very differently from one another, yet the CP of each was\nfound to be fixed in the same orientation (Fig. 3A,B). The same\nis also true for axonemes of epimastigote-form T. cruzi semi-\nattached flagella (Fig. 3C), as well as Leishmania major,\nHerpetomonas megaseliae and Crithidia fasciculata free\nflagella (Fig. 3D-F). Once more, the position of the CP was\ninvariant and had the same orientation as that seen in T. brucei.\nThe most recent common ancestor of the above kinetoplastid\nspecies existed ~250 million years ago (Douzery et al., 2004)\nand, in the light of these data, most probably had a CP in a\nfixed orientation. Moreover, in spite of many differences in cell\nmorphology, it appears that all of the extant progeny from this\ncommon ancestor have maintained the machinery that\nconstrains the CP of microtubules.\nRelease of CP constraint in mutants\nWe next asked what factors were controlling the fixed CP\norientation seen in trypanosomes. We used double-stranded\nRNAi to deplete particular flagellar and basal body proteins to\ngain insight into the mechanism determining CP orientation in\nT. brucei. The first of these was \u0003-tubulin \u2013 a protein associated\nwith basal bodies.

The number, N, indicates the number of independent micrographs combined in the diagram. (B) Radial\ndistribution of the doublets and the CP microtubules in transverse sections of axonemes from the wild-type trypanosomes. Since the CP are\nindistinguishable on the electron micrographs, their distribution can be anywhere in the range 0-180\u00b0, whereas the distribution of the doublets is\n0-360\u00b0.\nJo\nur\nn\na\nl o\nf C\nel\nl S\ncie\nnc\ne\n2408\nencoding \u0003-tubulin results in loss of the C-tubule of the basal\nbody microtubules (Dutcher and Trabuco, 1998; Fromherz et\nal., 2003). In Paramecium, silencing of the gene encoding \u0003-\ntubulin similarly results in loss of the C-tubule, but additionally\nloss of B- and even A-tubules was observed (Garreau de\nLoubresse et al., 2001). Since the radial symmetry of the\naxoneme is born from the ninefold symmetry of the basal body,\nwith the nine doublets of the axoneme extending from the A\nand B tubules of the triplet basal body, there is a prediction that\ndisruption of the basal body configuration will be transferred\nalong the axoneme.\nWe generated a T. brucei cell line for the inducible\nknockdown of \u0003-tubulin by RNAi. Prior to induction of \u0003-\ntubulin RNAi, trypanosomes were morphologically normal,\nand showed normal growth and motility. Induction of \u0003-tubulin\nRNAi resulted in a reduction in growth rate after 48 hours (Fig.\n4A). Several characteristic phenotypes were noted in\ntrypanosome populations following induction of \u0003-tubulin\nRNAi that varied in severity as a function of time post-\ninduction (see below). The earliest phenotypic effect\nwe observed, at >24 hours post-induction, was the loss of\nflagellar motility in trypanosomes that otherwise appeared\nmorphologically normal (Fig. 4B). To confirm the efficacy of\n\u0003-tubulin RNAi, we raised a monoclonal antibody, LAZ1,\nagainst T. brucei \u0003-tubulin (see Materials and Methods) and\nused it to monitor the levels of \u0003-tubulin protein post-induction.\nImmunoblotting confirmed that, following induction of RNAi,\nlevels of \u0003-tubulin were progressively reduced such that, by 48\nhours post-induction, \u0003-tubulin protein is barely detectable\n(Fig. 4C). By contrast, levels of \u0006-tubulin \u2013 which acts as both\nloading and specificity control in these RNAi experiments \u2013\nwere unaffected during the time course of the experiment (Fig.\n4C).\nInduction of RNAi in these cells did not initially block\nflagellar construction but resulted in the production of aberrant\nbasal bodies subtending immotile flagella. Basal body structure\nwas reduced to combinations of triplet, doublet and singlet\nmicrotubules (Fig. 4D), showing that the trypanosome basal\nbody is fundamentally dependent upon \u0003-tubulin function.\nDistal from the basal bodies, ultra-structural analysis of flagella\nrevealed disruption of the 9+2 arrangement by loss of outer\ndoublets (Fig. 4F,G). At later time-points post-induction (>96\nhours), more-severe defects were observed (with several\ndoublets missing from the axoneme); however, at 48 hours\npost-induction, the majority of disrupted axonemes had lost\nonly one doublet and in some instances only the B-tubule of a\nsingle doublet was absent. Interestingly, there was a significant\npreference for the disappearance of outer doublets 8 and 9 (\u00072\ntest, P<0.001). Despite this loss of outer doublets, no loss of\nthe CP occurred, indicating that CP nucleation is unimpaired\nin these cells.\nSome axonemes in the induced \u0003-tubulin RNAi cell line\ndisplay the canonical 9+2 arrangement. These most probably\nrepresent axonemes constructed before \u0003-tubulin levels had\ndropped below a crucial level and, accordingly, their\nabundance decreases with increasing time post-induction (data\nnot shown). In these axonemes, as for the non-induced cells,\nthe CP was orientated as seen for wild-type T. brucei (Fig. 4E).\nHowever, loss of one outer doublet microtubule, or even just\nthe B-tubule of a doublet, results in a total loss of correct CP\norientation with the CP now being orientated apparently\nrandomly around the central axis of the axoneme (Fig. 4F,G\nand Fig. 5D).\nAnother member of the tubulin family is \u0002-tubulin, also seen\nat the basal body and centriole region in a wide range of\neukaryotes (Nigg, 2004). More precisely, \u0002-tubulin localises to\nthe basal plate in Chlamydomonas, where it plays a role in CP\nnucleation (Silflow et al., 1999). We have previously reported\nthe effects of \u0002-tubulin depletion in T. brucei \u2013 induction of \u0002-\ntubulin RNAi produces immotile flagella that lack the CP\n(McKean et al., 2003). However, early in \u0002-tubulin RNAi\ninduction, there are a small number of cells (~9%) in which\nonly one of the two CP microtubules is lost. We analysed these\naxonemes with respect to orientation of the remaining\nmicrotubule and found that, in these 9+1 axonemes, the single\ncentral microtubule had a random distribution (Fig. 5A).\nHence, although \u0002-tubulin RNAi does not affect the integrity\nof the nine outer doublets, the radial symmetry of the 9+1\narrangement is not sufficient for constraining the CP position.\nInterestingly, the remaining, mis-orientated central\nmicrotubule is found at the same distance from the centre of\nthe axoneme, as it would be had its partner still been present,\nand does not collapse inwards. This argues against a model in\nwhich the CP push against the radial spokes to create a force\nthat is transduced out to the doublets.\nUnlike the basal body proteins \u0002- and \u0003-tubulin, the T. brucei\nParkin co-regulated gene products TbPACRG A and TbPACRG\nB are related proteins that appear to have a role in doublet\nmorphogenesis and locate along the length of the flagellum\n(Dawe et al., 2005). Depletion of both homologues\nsimultaneously (although not separately) by RNAi in T. brucei\ncauses flagellar paralysis and leads to premature termination of\nJournal of Cell Science 119 (12)\nFig. 3.

These\nmicrographs had the section angle corrected by the transformation T\u0005\nto become true transverse section, and they show the CP\nmicrotubules always aligned with respect to the doublets 3 and 8.\nThis orientation does not vary in either attached or partially attached\nflagella (trypanosomes), or free flagella (Leishmania, Herpetomonas,\nCrithidia).

The resulting disrupted axonemes look\nsuperficially like \u0003-tubulin mutants but the defects are more\nsevere and, importantly, do not originate in the basal body. Fig.\n5B shows the orientation of the CP in axonemes with variable\nnumbers of outer doublets (X+2) resulting from PACRG\nablation. Disruption of the axoneme again produced a\nperturbation of CP orientation. However, despite producing a\nmore severe axonemal disruption than that of \u0003-tubulin RNAi,\n55% of the X+2 axonemes analysed maintained the CP in a\nfixed, wild-type orientation.

The data\npresented here show a fixed CP orientation throughout the\nlength of the axonemes in several trypanosomatid species and\ndo not, therefore, support the hypothesis of CP rotation in\nKinetoplastida. However, one must always be mindful in such\nultra-structural studies of the possibility of fixation artefacts.\nThree lines of reasoning lead us to conclude that the fixed angle\nof the CP in our analysis reflects the true orientation of the CP\nduring flagellar beating: (1) In this report, cells were fixed in\naldehyde-based solutions believed to preserve the metachrony\nof the cilia on the Paramecium surface, as well as to preserve\nwaveforms during forward and reverse swimming of\nChlamydomonas. We reason that these reagents used to\nestablish CP orientation in the latter two organisms were\nappropriate fixatives for our analysis in trypanosomes. Our\nconclusion of a fixed CP orientation is also compatible with\ndata presented in previous studies on trypanosomes that\ninvolved other fixation techniques, such as high-pressure\nfreezing and freeze substitution (Wiese et al., 2003), as well as\ndetergent extraction followed by chemical fixation (Maga et al.,\n1999). (2) If the CP were falling back to a low-energy\nconfiguration within the axoneme, it might be expected that the\nprecise orientation would be influenced by the degree of local\nstrain as a result of bending. However, the axis of the CP is\nexceptionally well defined in our analysis despite being based\non a number of samples from random points along flagella \u2013\npresumably possessing different torsional strains. (3) The fixed\norientation of the CP in T. brucei can be disrupted by RNAi\nagainst specific gene products. This suggests that, were the CP\nof wild-type cells to rotate, our analysis would detect the\nrotation. However, although our and similar chemical-fixation\ntechniques are fast enough to preserve both CP orientation and\na normal-looking bending wave, it is noteworthy that they are\nprobably not sufficiently rapid to capture an instantaneous\n\u2018snap-shot\u2019 of the transitory positions of every axonemal\nstructure. For example, we cannot detect in our corrected\naxonemes any variation in the doublet positions caused by\nactivated dyneins pulling doublets closer together \u2013 a central\ntenet to the geometric clutch hypothesis (see Lindemann,\n2004). Such deformations, being asymmetric with respect to\naxonemal cross-sections, would not be affected by the ellipse\ncorrection approach presented here.\nRelative to an unmoving external reference, an invariable CP\norientation can only be achieved if the CP is fixed along its\nlength. However, if the CP is not seen in a constant position,\nthere are three possible explanations \u2013 one of which involves\nan unmoving CP, whereas the other two require CP movement.\nFirst, the CP orientation might be invariant (i.e. unmoving)\nJournal of Cell Science 119 (12)\n20\nD\n20\u03b4-tubulin PACRG\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n0 40 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360\nAngle (degrees)\nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n0 40 80 120 160 200 240 280 320 360\nAngle (degrees)doublets central pair\nPACRG\nB\nN=36\nX+2\nN=18\n9+2\n\u03b3-tubulin\nA\nN=18\n9+1\nPFR2\nC\nN=15\n9+2\nFig. 5.

(D) Radial distribution of\nthe doublets and the CP microtubules in transverse sections of axonemes from the induced \u0003-tubulin and PACRG RNAi trypanosomes.\nJo\nur\nn\na\nl o\nf C\nel\nl S\ncie\nnc\ne\n2411No CP rotation in trypanosomes\nalong the length of an individual axoneme, but variant between\naxonemes as a result of differences in the initial orientation of\nCPs at their origins. Second, the CP might be fixed at its basal\nend, but twist around its longitudinal axis during flagellar\nbeating. Since the basal end is unmoving, this model requires\na reverse twist of the CP during the recovery stroke to avoid\nsuper-coiling of the CP. The net CP movement is thus an\noscillation. Last, the CP might be movable at the base and also\nalong its length \u2013 allowing the CP to rotate relative to an\nunmoving external reference during the beat.\nHere, we report that CP orientation is fixed within\nkinetoplastid flagella and hence the CP does not move during\nflagellar beating. We used RNAi to investigate how CP\norientation is defined and whether it can be freed from\nconstraint. The fact that the CP is fixed in free Leishmania\nflagella suggests that CP orientation is independent of flagellar\nattachment to the trypanosomatid cell body. This is\nstrengthened by our analysis of the T. cruzi epimastigote\nflagellum, which is only associated with the cell body in its\nproximal segments. Yet again, the fixed CP orientation is\nmaintained throughout the attached and free segments of this\nflagellum.\nThe RNAi mutants described here all result in forms of\nflagellar paralysis. However, the orientation of the CP is not\nbeing entrained by flagellar beating. This can be demonstrated\nby the previously described RNAi against PFR2, which also\nresults in immotility in T. brucei (Bastin et al., 1998), but a\ncareful examination of axonemal cross-sections reveals that the\nCP remains fixed. Since CP orientation is independent of\nflagellar attachment and also beating, it must be defined by\ninteractions occurring solely within the flagellum. Such\ndefinition might occur by either: (1) determination of CP\norientation at its origin at the basal plate, which is then\npassively inherited distally along the flagellum; or (2) physical\nconstraint of CP orientation by proteins existing along the\nlength of the axoneme. Our data suggest that the former is an\nabsolute requirement for correct CP orientation; mis-\norientation of the CP can be prevented only when a native basal\nbody configuration is present in the cell, and CP mis-\norientation does not seem able to be corrected even when the\nultra-structure of the outer doublets appears normal (see \u0002-\ntubulin RNAi). However, there does seem to be a partial\ndependence on constraint by the axoneme because, in cells\ncontaining normal basal bodies but with severely disrupted\naxonemal configurations, correct CP orientation is sometimes\nlost. Hence, the mechanism by which the kinetoplastid CP is\nconstrained \u2013 when it is free to move in species such as\nChlamydomonas and Paramecium \u2013 acts predominantly at the\nbirth of the CP at the distal-end of the basal body, but is also\nto a lesser degree constrained by physical contacts made by the\nCP along the length of the flagellum. Although we cannot\nentirely rule out movement of the CP in trypanosome RNAi\nmutants, the removal of the CP constraint in trypanosomes\nmost probably does not result in CP rotation or oscillation, but\nin a mis-orientation that is invariant within an individual\naxoneme. This can be seen in the fact that all the RNAi mutants\ndescribed are paralysed, and hence cannot be moving the CP\nin response to flagellar beating. Whether or not the CP in such\naxonemes would move in response to an externally enforced\nbeat remains to be seen.\nThe functional reasons for CP rotation in some but not all\naxonemes have yet to be fully understood. Bray suggested that\nthe CP rotates whenever a ciliary beat is three dimensional \u2013\ni.e. when the effective and recovery strokes occur in different\nplanes (Bray, 1992). Paramecium supports this condition since\nit performs non-planar, asymmetrical waves \u2013 during forward\nor reverse swimming, the cilia beat presents a planar power\nstroke and a three-dimensional recovery stroke (Omoto and\nKung, 1979). However, Chlamydomonas performs planar\nwaves whether swimming forwards (asymmetrical) or\nbackwards (symmetrical) (Bessen et al., 1980). In addition,\nChlamydomonas flagella are able to propagate planar\nasymmetrical and symmetrical waveforms despite the lack of\nCP (Frey et al., 1997; Wakabayashi et al., 1997). Another\nproposal is that cilia and flagella of organisms that rely on rapid\nchanges in waveform, beat frequency and effective stroke\norientation require variable CP position, whereas an\nunchanging orientation is supposed to be a derived\nsimplification in organelles that have a permanent bend plane,\nsuch as ctenophore comb plate cilia and many metazoan\nspermatozoa (Mitchell, 2004). However, this hypothesis also\nappears incomplete since trypanosomes \u2013 here shown to have\na fixed CP orientation \u2013 present complex waveforms. The main\nwaveform is a planar, symmetrical wave run from the distal tip\nto its base (Holwill, 1965a; Holwill, 1965b), but trypanosomes\ncan also re-orientate themselves by reversing their flagellar\nwave (Sugrue et al., 1988), which becomes asymmetrical and\nruns from base to tip (Holwill and McGregor, 1976).\nSwimming reversal has also been reported in Chlamydomonas\n(Bessen et al., 1980) and Paramecium (Naitoh and Kaneko,\n1973), although the mode is distinct in each case (Holwill and\nMcGregor, 1976). The trypanosome flagellum is not only a\ndynamic motility organelle, but has also evolved to perform\nother biological processes, such as participating in cell division\n(Moreira-Leite et al., 2001) and moving the parasite through\nchallenging environments during its cell cycle in the vertebrate\nand invertebrate host. In the invertebrate host, the flagellum is\nan organelle for attachment to the host epithelia (Vickerman,\n1973; Vickerman and Tetley, 1990), which ensures\ntransmission to vertebrates. Whether the trypanosome\nswimming behaviour is not complex enough to require\nmovable CP orientation to differentially regulate specific\ndynein arms is not yet clear. However, it seems reasonable to\nsuggest that the swimming changes trypanosomes have to deal\nwith might well be precisely regulated but by means other than\na variable CP orientation.\nThis report has brought further insights into the relationship\nof functional constraints and axoneme integrity in eukaryotic\nflagella. This raises interesting questions about the molecular\nmechanisms of such phenomena and one wonders whether\ndifferences between axonemes capable of CP rotation versus\naxonemes bearing fixed CPs could be reflected in flagellar\ncomposition. In this regard, flagellar proteome comparisons\nhold much promise.\nMaterials and Methods\nCell lines\nProcyclic Trypanosoma brucei 427 strain cells were maintained in SDM 79 medium\nsupplemented with 10% v\/v foetal calf serum (FCS) at 28\u00b0C; bloodstream-form 427\nstrain cells were maintained in HMI9 medium supplemented with 15% v\/v FCS at\n37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. RNA interference (RNAi) mutant cell lines were generated from\nthe T. brucei 29-13 cell line, which is a derivative of the procyclic 427 strain\ncontaining transgenes encoding T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor\nJo\nur\nn\na\nl o\nf C\nel\nl S\ncie\nnc\ne\n2412\nproteins. 29-13 cells were maintained as for 427 strain procyclic cells. Stable,\ninducible RNAi mutants for the genes encoding PFR2, \u0002-tubulin and PACRG\n(double knockdown of A and B isoforms) have been described previously (Bastin\net al., 1998; Dawe et al., 2005; McKean et al., 2003). To generate cell lines in which\nRNAi against the gene encoding \u0003-tubulin could be induced, a 500 bp fragment of\nthe T. brucei \u0003-tubulin open reading frame was amplified from genomic DNA using\nthe primers 5\u0004-CTCGAGAAGCTTCGCGAGAGTGCGGATGCTGT-3\u0004 and 5\u0004-\nACTTCTCGAGAGCACTTCCCGC-3\u0004 (restriction enzyme recognition sequence\nunderlined). This amplicon was digested with HindIII and XhoI restriction\nendonucleases and ligated into the vector pZJM (Wang et al., 2000). 20 \tg of this\nconstruct was used to stably transform 2\b107 actively dividing 29-13 cells in cold\nZPFM buffer (Bellofatto and Cross, 1989) by electroporation twice at 4.25 kV cm\u20131,\nwith three pulses of 100 microseconds separated by 200 milliseconds (Electro\nSquare Porator; BTX). Post-electroporation, cells were allowed to recover for 16\nhours, after which time stable transformants were selected by the addition of\n2.5 \tg ml\u20131 phleomycin, 15 \tg ml\u20131 G418 and 50 \tg ml\u20131 hygromycin; and\nsubsequently cloned by limiting dilution. Prior to induction, RNAi mutants were\nleft in medium devoid of drug for 24 hours, then diluted to 5\b105 cells ml\u20131, and\ninduced by the addition of 1 \tg ml\u20131 tetracycline. Cultures were diluted back to a\ndensity of 5\b105 cells ml\u20131 every 24 hours, and fresh tetracycline was added to the\nculture medium.\nPromastigote-form Leishmania major Friedlin VI strain cells were cultured at\n28\u00b0C in Medium 199 with Earle\u2019s Salt and L-glutamine supplemented with 40 mM\nHEPES, 10% v\/v FCS and 5 \tg ml\u20131 haemin. Promastigote-form Herpetomonas\nmegaseliae and choanomastigote-form Crithidia fasciculata cells were cultured in\nBrain and Hearth Infusion medium supplemented with 5% v\/v FCS.

This amplicon was ligated\ninto the TA cloning site of pGEMT-Easy (Promega), released by NdeI and BamHI\ndigestion, and ligated into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET15b (Novagen).\nRecombinant \u0003-tubulin was expressed in FB810 (a RecA derivative of BL21)\n(McKean et al., 2001) and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography followed by\npreparative SDS-PAGE. BALB\/c mice were immunised with purified recombinant\n\u0003-tubulin and hybridomas produced as described previously (Woods et al., 1989).\nProtein sample preparation and western blotting\nFor protein depletion analysis, \u0003-tubulin RNAi mutant cells (2\b108) were harvested\nat various time-points after the addition of tetracycline, washed in PBS (150 mM\nNaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors, and\nresuspended in boiling Laemmli sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and immersion transfer\nto nitrocellulose membrane were performed using standard techniques described\nelsewhere (Sambrook and Russell, 2001). For immunoblotting, membranes were\nblocked with 3% w\/v skimmed milk in TTBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl,\n0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5), labelled with either anti-\u0003-tubulin monoclonal antibody,\nor anti-\u0006-tubulin monoclonal antibody KMX (Birkett et al., 1985), developed with\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Sigma)\nand detected by the ECL detection system (Amersham).\nSample preparation for electron microscopy\nT. brucei, T. cruzi, L. major, H. megaseliae and C. fasciculata samples for thin-\nsection transmission electron microscopy were prepared by fixing cells in culture\nwith 4% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells\nwere post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH\n7 for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C, washed several times in double-distilled water, stained en bloc\nwith 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 16 hours at 4\u00b0C, dehydrated through acetone\nand embedded in epoxy resin.\nGeometric correction of electron micrographs\nTo correct for variations in the angle of sectioning in micrographs collected in this\nstudy, the following mathematical correction was applied. Considering the axoneme\nas a cylinder, any cross-section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (the z\u0004 axis)\nwill depict a perfect circle. However, any \u2018glancing\u2019 section, which is not exactly\n90\u00b0 to the z\u0004 axis, will show an ellipse whose eccentricity increases as the angle\nbetween the section and a true perpendicular section (\u0005) increases (see Fig. 1).\nHence, an ellipse in the observed xy plane \u2013 formed by taking a section at an angle\n(90-\u0005)\u00b0 to the true longitudinal axis z\u0004 \u2013 can be superimposed onto the true\ntransverse plane, x\u0004y\u0004, by the transformation:\n\u239b\u239c\u239d\n\u239e\u239f\u23a0\nx cos \u0005\ny\n,\n\u239b\u239c\u239d\n\u239e\u239f\u23a0\nx\u0004\ny\u0004\n=\nwhere the maximum diameter of the ellipse lies along the x axis. The result is a\nreacquisition of a circular transverse section.\nFrom our \u2018transverse\u2019 sections, the positions of the centre of each A tubule of the\naxonemal outer doublet microtubules and the centre of each of the CP microtubules\nwere mapped by hand using the software NIH Image as an interface. The position\nof each microtubule in the observed xy plane was thus defined by a point (xi, yi).\nThe origin was defined by the mean xi and yi values for the nine doublets and an\nestimate of \u0005 was made from the eccentricity of the doublet positions:\nwhere d is the distance of a point from the origin, i.e.:\ndi2 = (xi\u2013x)2 + (yi\u2013y)2 .\nThe axes were then rotated so that the doublet with the maximum di value lay along\nthe positive x axis. Microtubule positions were superimposed onto the true\ntransverse plane x\u0004y\u0004 by the transformation:\nEach transformed point (x\u0004i, y\u0004i) has a distance d\u0004i from the origin and makes an\nangle \ni to the y\u0004 axis. The x\u0004y\u0004 axes were rotated such that the mean of the\ndifferences of each \ni from its expected value [2\u000b(n\u20131)\/9, where n is the doublet\nnumber] was zero. Finally, the microtubule positions were normalised against the\nmean d\u0004 value for the doublets.\nFor most axonemes, minimum and maximum doublet distances provide a good\nestimate of ellipse angle and eccentricity (see Fig. 2A). However, in situations such\nas the PACRG mutant cell lines, where there is gross disruption of the outer\ndoublets, this measurement is no longer sufficient. For these axonemes, it is\nnecessary to use information from all remaining doublets, such as fitting the data\npoints to an ellipse. We used the free software LSM (http:\/\/www.prz.rzeszow.pl\/\n~janand\/) to perform non-linear least-squares fitting of the data. All other\ncalculations follow as above.\nThe above ellipse corrections are obviously just as applicable to images as they\nare to individual data points (see Fig. 1C). In this case, we used parameters estimated\nfrom non-linear least-squares fitting as above and the software NIH Image\n(http:\/\/rsb.info.nih.gov\/nih-image\/) with custom macros (available from the authors\nof this article on request).\nWe thank J.
