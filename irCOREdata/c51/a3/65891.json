Materials showing CMR often\nexhibit magnetoelectronic phase separation.1\u20133 Magnetoelec-\ntronic heterogeneity exists where ferromagnetic \u0001FM\u0002 metal-\nlic clusters are distinct from non-FM insulating regions.4 Re-\ncently there has been considerable interest in La1\u2212xSrxCoO3\n\u0001LSCO\u0002 which clearly exhibits magnetoelectronic inhomoge-\nneity as verified by such diverse techniques as electron\nmicroscopy,5 nuclear magnetic resonance,6 and small angle\nneutron scattering.7 The parent compound LaCoO3 is of in-\nterest due to its thermally activated spin state transition from\na low spin \u0001LS\u0002 S=0 state, t2g6eg\n0\n, to an intermediate spin\n\u0001IS\u0002 S=1 state, t2g5eg\n1\n. This occurs because of a direct com-\npetition between Hund\u2019s exchange energy and the crystal\nfield splitting of the d levels.8,9 Our recent work has con-\nfirmed the theoretical prediction10 of magnetic exciton for-\nmation in bulk LaCoO3\u2212\u0003 due to the presence of oxygen\nvacancies.11 An exciton is a region of Co ions not in the LS\nground state, created by a local polarization of Co ions\naround the oxygen vacancy.10 This is a similar concept to a\nmagnetic polaron where a hole or electron ferromagnetically\npolarizes the surrounding antiferromagnetic lattice; an exci-\nton is different as the surrounding magnetic ions are initially\nin a LS, S=0 state. This may be the precursor of magneto-\nelectronic phase separation that is observed upon doping,\ni.e., these excitons are directly analogous to the ferromag-\nnetic clusters formed at high x and as such may behave in a\nsimilar manner. There is evidence to suggest that the excitons\ncan form in both the LS and IS state, leading to the possibil-\nity of interactions between the exciton and the undoped\nLaCoO3 matrix. Magnetic phase separation is ubiquitous in\ncomplex oxides, with formation of FM clusters and a non-\nmagnetic background being common. Many details of the\nFM cluster behavior have been identified \u0001e.g., field induced\ngrowth, temperature dependence etc.\u0002, and high x composi-\ntions have recently shown behavior suggesting field induced\nexchange anisotropy.12 Although the thermally induced spin\nstate has been observed in lightly doped LSCO \u0001x\u00040.08\u0002\n\u0001Refs. 13 and 14\u0002 interactions between the matrix and the Sr\nclusters have not been identified.\nIn this paper we present muon spectroscopy and magnetic\nsusceptibility data which provide insight into the develop-\nment of the magnetic phase separation occurring in LSCO\nfrom x=0 to 0.20. We demonstrate that in LaCoO3\u2212\u0003 the\nmagnetic excitons are interacting directly with the undoped\nCo3+ matrix surrounding the excitons as it undergoes a LS-IS\ntransition. The interaction is field dependent indicating that it\nis frustrated on a local level. The result is further comple-\nmented by comparative measurements on LSCO. The com-\nposition x=0.03 is of significance as this is in the dilute\ncluster limit. The majority of the material \u201cexists\u201d as the\nundoped LaCoO3 matrix. Any competing interactions be-\ntween the hole rich regions and the background material are\nhighlighted and the results are comparable to the investiga-\ntions into LaCoO3\u2212\u0003. We suggest that the FM clusters, pro-\nduced when hole doping with Sr ions, interact locally with\nthe non-FM undoped Co3+ \u201cmatrix\u201d surrounding the clusters.\nThis mechanism influences the magnetic and electrical prop-\nerties of LSCO. Such a local interaction demonstrated here\nmay be applicable to other oxide materials exhibiting mag-\nnetic phase separation.\nBulk muon spin rotation and relaxation \u0001\u0005SR\u0002 experi-\nments were performed at the PSI in Switzerland on the in-\nstrument Dolly. \u0005SR is well suited to the exploration of local\nmagnetic correlations, with a sampling radius of \u000320 \u00c5.\nComplementary bulk magnetic measurements were per-\nformed while warming from 2 to 300 K in fields up to 5 T\nusing a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magnetometer.\nMeasurements have been performed upon a single crystal\nLaCoO3\u2212\u0003 sample, grown by the floating zone furnace tech-\nnique, which was used in our previous investigation.11 Poly-\ncrystalline samples of LSCO were prepared using a standard\nsolid state reaction;15 all samples were found to be single\nphase using x-ray diffraction.\n\u0005SR measurements were performed on LaCoO3\u2212\u0003 in the\nzero field \u0001ZF\u0002 and transverse field \u0001TF\u0002 configurations. The\nTF measurements can be fitted over the entire temperature\nrange using a relaxation function of the form,\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 104411 \u00012006\u0002\n1098-0121\/2006\/74\u000110\u0002\/104411\u00015\u0002 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society104411-1\nGx\u0001t\u0002 = Atf\ns exp\u0001\u2212 \u0004\u0006tf\ns t\u00052\u0002cos\u00012\u0007\b\u0005t\u0002 + Atf\nf exp\u0001\u2212 \u0004\ttf\nf t\u00052\u0002 + Abg,\n\u00011\u0002\nwhere Atf\ns\n, Atf\nf\n, and Abg are the initial asymmetries of, respec-\ntively, the oscillatory, Gaussian, and background compo-\nnents, and s and f denote slow and fast relaxing components.\nThe parameters \u0006tf\ns and \ttf\nf are the depolarization rates for the\ntwo separate decays and \b\u0005 is the muon precession fre-\nquency. No other function was required to fit the TF data.\nAbove 90 K, only the first term in Eq. \u00011\u0002 was required to fit\nthe data, however at lower temperatures the second term be-\ngins to dephase the oscillatory component. The total asym-\nmetry over the temperature range investigated remains con-\nstant indicating that the additional relaxation below 90 K is a\nresult of paramagnetic species \u0001this process is discussed in\ndepth in Ref. 11\u0002. These results were attributed11 to the spin\nstate transition and magnetic exciton formation, which is a\ndirect result of the IS-LS thermal excitation. An exciton can\nonly form if Co3+ ions close to the oxygen vacancy are ini-\ntially in the LS state.10 Investigations into the LS-IS transi-\ntion region by Zobel et al.9 revealed that the rate of Co3+ ions\nundergoing the spin transition as a function of temperature is\nmaximized at about 50 K. Therefore, the requirement of the\nexistence of LS Co3+ ions for the exciton formation also\nsuggests that the density of excitons changes rapidly with\ntemperature at 50 K. Below this temperature the majority of\nthe undoped Co3+ ion matrix is in a LS state and the number\nof magnetic excitons would be expected to reach its maxi-\nmum value, while at temperatures well above the LS-IS tran-\nsition the number of excitons will be very small. The second\nterm in Eq. \u00011\u0002 was attributed to the depolarization of muons\nby noninteracting magnetic excitons which were created\nupon reducing temperature. The first term of Eq. \u00011\u0002 was\nassociated with magnetic excitons which were created within\na predominately IS Co3+ environment, and thus it is the tem-\nperature dependence of \u0006tf\ns that is of interest when consider-\ning possible \u201cexciton-non-FM Co3+ matrix\u201d interactions.\nThe inset of Fig. 1 shows the temperature dependence of\n\u0006tf\ns for both ZF and TF measurements \u0001the ZF relaxation\nabove 50 K is a simple Gaussian decay11\u0002. Longitudinal field\n\u0005SR has shown that this relaxation arises from dynamical,\nfluctuating random local fields.11 From Fig. 1 it is clear that\nthe depolarization rates peak at 50 K for all fields, but no\ncorresponding bulk magnetic transition can be observed by\nstandard magnetic susceptibility measurements. This can be\ninterpreted as evidence that the exciton becomes the domi-\nnant magnetic species as the IS Co3+ ions fall into the LS\nstate and that there are no long range magnetic interactions\nbetween the magnetic excitons.9,10 Figure 1 demonstrates\nthat the field dependent depolarization follows a simple\nArrhenius thermal activation law of the form \u0006\n=\u00060 expEA\/kbT above 50 K for all measured fields. Moreover,\nthe activation energy decreases with increasing magnetic\nfield while the pre-exponential factor \u00060 increases linearly\nwith field. The high temperature tails of the depolarization\nrates do not scale with magnetic field, contrary to what might\nbe expected of paramagnetic IS Co3+ ions,7 which should\nhave a field distribution independent of applied field.18\nAbove 50 K it is likely that any exciton that is formed\nwill be surrounded by undoped IS Co3+ matrix, leading to a\npossible interaction between excitons and the surrounding\nmatrix. A Curie-Weiss fit to the magnetic susceptibility data\nfor 100 K\u0004T\u0004500 K results in a \n value of about\n\u2212200 K,16 suggesting a strong AF interaction between neigh-\nboring IS Co3+ ions. Such an interaction between Co3+ ions\nin the exciton and ions in the surrounding IS matrix could\nlead to magnetic frustration at a local level. This implies that\nthe muon depolarization rate is effected by the excitons. The\nexcitons will be easily polarized with respect to the field,11\nbut the IS Co3+ ions surrounding the excitons will be at-\ntempting to align themselves in accordance with local AF\ncoupling. The magnetic interaction between the excitons and\nthe surrounding matrix may then be field dependent, leading\nto an increase in \u00060, the field distribution, and a decrease in\nactivation energy, as the excitons and matrix align with the\nexternal field.\nThis interpretation of the data is based upon the field de-\npendent measurement of the depolarization rate from Fig. 1,\nhowever, the Arrhenius fit was performed over a small tem-\nperature range and could provide a valid reason for the dif-\nference in extracted components. Conversely, our previous\nwork11 has already shown that it is possible to induce mag-\nnetic remanence in the LS temperature region. Specifically, if\nthe sample is field cooled \u0001FC\u0002 to 50 K and then the field is\nremoved there is a previously unseen remnant component of\nthe magnetization, that scales with the strength of the cooling\nfield. This cannot be due only to the excitons as no magnetic\nanisotropy is expected of them.10 Therefore, the remnant mo-\nment \u0001\u0005\u0002 at 50 K can be viewed as a consequence of the\nexciton interacting with its local environment to create a lo-\ncal anisotropy.\nThe field cooling dependent \u0005 can be expressed in terms\nof the activation energy \u0004Ea\u0001B\u0002\u0005 obtained from field depen-\ndent \u0005SR measurements, in the form, \u0005\u000bexp\u0004Ea\u0001B\u0002 \/kBT\u0005.\nFigure 2 shows the inverse field dependence of the natural\nlogarithm of the remnant moment at 50 K, suggesting that\nthe remnant moment is indeed a consequence of the IS ma-\ntrix interacting with some excitons. The interaction is field\ndependent as determined by \u0005SR measurements.

Specifically, the clusters contain Co4+ ions\nand a metal insulator transition \u0001MIT\u0002 is observed when the\nclusters percolate \u0001x\u00060.17\u0002.7,17 The possibility of the un-\ndoped LaCoO3 matrix contributing to the magnetic proper-\nties is generally neglected.14 Also, no spin glass behavior is\nobserved when x\u00040.06.7,17 However, \u0005SR is sensitive to the\nlocal magnetic environment. TF measurements \u000110 m T\u0002 on\nthe x=0.03 sample were performed, and the data can be fit-\nted with Eq. \u00011\u0002 over the entire temperature range, with the\nsecond component becoming apparent below 50 K. Figure 3\nshows the temperature dependence of the initial asymmetry\nof the oscillatory component \u0001Atf\ns \u0002 compared to the derivative\nof the FC magnetic susceptibility with respect to tempera-\nture. This derivative highlights any subtle change in the mag-\nnetic response of the sample. There is a clear dephasing of\nthe muons coincident with a change in d\r \/dT below 50 K. A\nsimilar response was observed in LaCoO3 as the system un-\nderwent the LS-IS transition and was inferred to be due to\nthe increased density of magnetic excitons dephasing the\nmuons.11 In the x=0.03 sample the situation is somewhat\ndifferent as the doping occurs due to the presence of Sr ions.\nThe drop in Atf\ns is coincident with the second Gaussian com-\nponent being required to fit the data. No change in Abg is\nseen over the entire temperature range. The inset shows the\ntemperature dependent inverse magnetic susceptibility as a\nfunction of applied field. The data cooled and measured in\n5 T, 10 m T and 1 m T clearly superimpose above 225 K,\nand produces a \n value of 3\u00b14 K demonstrating that the\nmaterial has essentially a \u0001noninteracting\u0002 paramagnetic tem-\nperature dependence. However, below 225 K the data no\nlonger overlap. The experiments performed were FC, sug-\ngesting that the orientation of the local anisotropy field is\nstrongly field dependent, highlighting the role of competing\nmagnetic interactions. One simple origin of this behavior\nstems from the local AF interactions in the undoped LaCoO3\nmatrix. If these \u201crandom\u201d interactions are enveloping the\nhole-rich clusters, a field dependent magnetic alignment that\nresults from the interplay between frustrated interactions can\nbe envisaged, where the Co3+ HS ions in the cluster \u0001induced\nby the Co4+ ions\u0002 are analogous to the magnetic excitons\npresent in LaCoO3. Note the FM intracluster interaction\n\u0001Co4+-Co3+\u0002 will be different to the AF interactions observed\nin the magnetic excitons in LaCoO3.\nIf the local ordering of the AF LaCoO3 matrix is interact-\ning with the hole-rich clusters as interpreted from the inset of\nFig. 3 then the field distribution will be sensitive to this\nordering. Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of \u0006tf\ns\nand clearly demonstrates that at about 25 K there is an ap-\nparent magnetic transition. No such observation has been\nmade before, and we suggest that here the clusters become\ndominant. This directly implies that above 25 K the clusters\nmust have been interacting with the undoped LaCoO3 matrix\nwhich is undergoing a thermally induced spin transition.

The\nvalue of Ea is \u000625 K and, for a spin glass,19 this makes little\nsense as the fitting range to obtain this energy is \u000e26 K \u0001also\nno glassy behavior21 is observed\u0002. Because Ea is less than\nthe fitted temperature range there may be more than one\nactivated process involved in the depolarization of the\nmuons. This can easily be envisaged when considering two\ncompeting activation energies E1 and E2 \u0001representing the\ncompeting magnetic interactions when a magnetic field is\napplied\u0002, of the form, A exp\u0001E2 \/kBT\u0002 \/B exp\u0001E1 \/kBT\u0002\n=C exp\u0004\u0001E2\u2212E1\u0002 \/kBT\u0005 where A, B, and C are constants. The\nactivation energy of LaCoO3 when applying a TF field of\n10 m T has already been calculated to be 131 K \u0001Fig. 1\u0002, and\nthis field dependent activation energy was related to the cou-\npling between the magnetic excitons and LaCoO3 matrix.\nConsidering the x=0.03 sample, it is feasible to acknowledge\nthe presence of undoped LaCoO3 regions interacting with the\ninduced HS Co3+ ions which form part of the hole-rich clus-\nters; the similarity of the two systems suggests that E2 \/kB\ncan be assigned a value of 131 K. Assuming the resulting\nactivation calculated in Fig. 4 is 25 K \u0001from the Co4+-Co3+\ncluster interaction\u0002, E1 \/kB takes a value just over 110 K. In\nthis temperature regime a shoulder in \u0006tf\ns is observed in Fig.\n4. This suggests that the muons appear to be sensitive to the\nundoped local LaCoO3 and to the exchange between ther-\nmally activated Co ions surrounding the hole-rich clusters, a\nLS-IS transition in x=0.03 is being observed. Note the tran-\nsition is not observed in bulk measurements because its con-\ntribution to the total magnetic susceptibility is several orders\nof magnitude smaller than even a 1% contribution from FM\nSr rich clusters.11\nWe have performed complementary zero field \u0005SR mea-\nsurements on LSCO samples around the MIT, concentrating\non the x=0.15 and 0.20 samples which support the interpre-\ntation of cluster-matrix interactions presented in this work.\nSpecifically no muon precession frequency was observed in\nx=0.20 \u0001the FM region\u0002, in agreement with previous work\non a x=0.30 sample20 and the known spin glass behavior\nwas not observed with muon spectroscopy21 in the x=0.15\nsample.

The behavior of the relaxation in the x\n=0.20 sample is not what is expected for a true FM ordering\nof the bulk, suggesting that the hole-rich clusters are under-\ngoing local interactions. Figure 5\u0001a\u0002 shows the temperature\ndependence of the A for both x=0.15 and 0.20 compared\ndirectly to the FC dc magnetic data of the samples. The\ngradual dephasing in the x=0.15 sample is seen to clearly\noccur, beginning at 220 K. The drop in the initial asymmetry\nclearly tracks the increase in magnetic susceptibility suggest-\ning that, below 220 K, the muons are being dephased by\nlocal perturbations that induce local magnetic order; this be-\nhavior has been previously attributed to the matrix interact-\ning with the excitons or clusters for the case of x=0 and\n0.03, respectively. The muon data shown in Fig. 5 can be\ninterpreted with this model also assuming matrix-cluster in-\nteractions. Above the percolation limit the muons still\ndephase indicating that the matrix still contributes to the\nmagnetism even though there is contact between clusters.\nThe local matrix interactions moderate the cluster ordering,\nwhich explains why all the samples investigated dephase be-\nlow 220 K, and a similar drop in the asymmetry is observed\nfor the x=0.30 composition.20\nFigure 5\u0001b\u0002 also directly compares the temperature depen-\ndence of the depolarization rates \u0001\u0006\u0002 for the x=0.15 and 0.20\nsamples. The depolarization rate at the respective transitions\nare the same for both samples within the error bars, giving a\nclear indication that the field distribution of the muons does\nnot alter through the percolative metal insulator transition.\nThis is an important result as it indicates that the muons are\nsampling the hole-rich clusters \u0001implied from the observed\ntransition temperatures\u0002, and that the interaction between the\nclusters does not change through the MIT. Therefore it ap-\npears that the muons are detecting the known magnetic phase\nseparation, however the matrix is moderating the magnetic\nresponse upon a local level. Both peaks are extremely broad\nwith the x=0.15 sample showing an increase in \u0006 below\n220 K; however, as noted above, this relaxation is not acti-\nvated or representative of a spin glass transition.21 This indi-\ncates the importance of the undoped LaCoO3 matrix interact-\ning with the clusters even in the high doping regime.\nIn summary we have clearly demonstrated evidence for\nexchange between the HS exciton and the undoped Co3+ ion\nmatrix in LaCoO3\u2212\u0003. Moreover in the phase separated mate-\nrial LSCO we have observed the IS-LS transition of the un-\ndoped LaCoO3 matrix at low x. The presence of an undoped\nLaCoO3 matrix clearly has a profound effect upon the prop-\nerties of the magnetic clusters present in the x=0.03 sample,\nwhich appear to be weakly exchange coupled on a local\nlevel. Our results also demonstrate the importance of the\nLaCoO3 matrix for compositions close to the percolative\nMIT. This observation of local exchange interactions be-\ntween FM regions and non-FM regions could be applicable\nto CMR materials.\nFIG. 5. \u0001a\u0002 Temperature dependent comparison of the suscepti-\nbility \u0001squares\u0002 and initial asymmetry \u0001triangles\u0002 of the x=0.15\n\u0001filled\u0002 and 0.20 \u0001hollow\u0002 samples. \u0001b\u0002 The temperature dependence\nof the depolarization rates \u0001\u0006\u0002 for the two samples.\nGIBLIN et al.
