Two routes \nare taken, which the author tries to interlink without seeking a hard and fast \njuncture. The first is a study of what children are doing when they talk into a toy \ntelephone, with reference to a transcript taken from empirical research. \nKnowledge of the essential structure of telephone discourse is displayed, as are \nemotional motivations behind the construction of pretence talk. The second is \nthe notion of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 as coined by Piaget and developed, within his \nsociocultural perspective to language acquisition, by Vygotsky. The author \nargues that dominant contemporary presentations of Vygotsky\u2019s notion of \n\u2018egocentric speech\u2019 tend to stress the self-regulatory or planning function at the \nexpense of its role in expression of the imagination. The two discussions come \ntogether in the suggestion that the deployment of the imagination in \nreassembling sociocultural knowledge for the creation of pretence play, \nsometimes expressed in private speech, can be a significant factor in the exercise \nof discourse competencies for young children. \nIntroduction \nOne December day, Katie, 3 years and 11 months old, walked into a child-sized \ntelephone box situated in the nursery that she attended each weekday \nmorning. It was near the end of a period of free-choice activities. But the time \nhad come to clear up, prior to the well-organised routine of having a snack, \nJULIA GILLEN  \n172 \nvisiting the cloakroom and the other whole-group activities which curtailed \nthe morning at pre-school. \nAs a language development researcher spending 9 months in the nursery \ngathering data on children\u2019s interactions with toy telephones, I was later able \nto play back the video recording of what Katie said. It was not particularly \nremarkable in having any single unusual feature; but, as ethnomethodologists \nsuch as Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson (1974) have demonstrated, unravelling \nsmall pieces of discourse that at first sight seem relatively mundane can be \nhighly rewarding in discovery of their underlying complexity of organisation. \nKatie\u2019s Pretence Telephone Call \nThe time is given in minutes and seconds, followed by Katie\u2019s speech and (in \nitalics) Katie\u2019s action. \n \n0.00 dials \n0.01 picks up receiver \n0.02 Mummy, I\u2019m tidying up now and I want to play. Goodbye. \n0.07 almost hangs up; then lifts receiver \n0.08 dials (for approx. 2 seconds) \n0.10 Hello \n0.11 dials (for approx. 4 seconds) \n0.16 Hello yeh bye. Mummy\u2019s poorly bye \n0.19 hangs up \n \nIn looking at the data collected for my research on children\u2019s pretence and \nactual dialogic telephone talk I became interested in considering some aspects \nof it in the light of Vygotsky\u2019s (1987b) notion of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019. I shall be \nlooking at this idea in detail, but initially adumbrate the notion. It is important \nto explain that Vygotsky was here working with a term coined by Piaget \n(1959). Therefore, although he disagreed that \u2018egocentricity\u2019 was a \ncharacteristic of the phenomenon, he continued to use the phrase (and so shall \nI), while carefully maintaining suspicious quotation marks around it. Many \nlater writers on \u2018egocentric speech\u2019, whether working from Piaget\u2019s theories or \nendeavouring to take into account Vygotsky\u2019s, find that the phenomenon is \nsomething of a broad term: talking apparently to oneself but very probably in \nthe presence of other(s). Piaget (1959) immediately divided this phenomenon \ninto three categories, as discussed later. Study of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 has been \nfound useful by many researchers of children\u2019s language development (see \nDiaz & Berk, 1992 for a review). In particular, Berk, as reported in her 1992 \noverview of many years\u2019 research in the USA, has studied the talk of children \nat school talking to themselves while accomplishing tasks. In this context, she \nrelabelled \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 as \u2018private speech\u2019. The age range studied is \nfrom 4 to 10 years, and Berk\u2019s particular emphasis is speech-accompanying \nactivities that present a cognitive challenge. Shields\u2019s (1979) British study was \nof the natural language of nursery school children playing and showed that \nVYGOTSKY\u2019S \u2018EGOCENTRIC SPEECH\u2019  \n173 \nany cognitive challenges arise spontaneously and are presented by\/to the self \nrather than being initiated by the teacher and\/or researcher. In addition, the \npresence of peers is often significant. These differences receive further \nattention later in the article. \nIt is important to state that in this article my aim is not to reach an \noverall explanation of data in terms of either Piaget\u2019s or Vygotsky\u2019s notion of \n\u2018egocentric speech\u2019, however modified. Neither am I trying to achieve a \ndefinitive resolution of the notion of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 through appeal to \ndata. Rather, as Berk and Shields have attempted in their very different ways, I \nbring my reading of data of young children\u2019s talk that is not obviously directed \nto another person, that has been collected in a particular context (in my case in \nplay with telephones), and place this with an exploration of Vygotsky\u2019s \ntheories concerned with \u2018egocentric speech\u2019. I do this in the hope of enhancing \nour overall understanding of children\u2019s discourse development. \nStudy Design \nBefore discussing further \u2018egocentric speech\u2019, I explain part of the rationale \nbehind the study in which Katie\u2019s call was produced. How children learn to \ntalk on the telephone has been a rarely investigated area, in contrast to how \nthey manage other arenas of communicative competence such as talking to \ncaregivers or becoming literate. Yet, the telephone does offer a site of \nparticular interest. It is ubiquitous in modern life and children are partially \naware of its function from infancy (Bretherton, 1984). The telephone offers a \nparticular challenge to the young child who has invariably developed language \nin face-to-face situations, where both non-verbal cues and a shared \nenvironment can facilitate the communicative process, along with the \ndeployment of linguistic resources. Research into young children learning to \ntalk on the telephone concentrates almost entirely upon dialogues between \nyoung children and adults obtained under artificial conditions (Holmes, 1981; \nVeach, 1981; Bordeaux & Willbrand, 1987; Warren & Tate, 1992; Cameron & \nLee, 1997; Cameron, et al, 1997). \nA stimulating and relatively holistic approach to the issue of the \nacquisition of telephone discourse was provided by Mininni (1985). Although \nvery small scale and limited in coverage, this study was inspirational to me in \nits joint focus upon children\u2019s naturalistically obtained telephone conversations \nand their earlier or overlapping spontaneous pretence play with toy, or actual, \nyet unconnected phones. Mininni\u2019s suggestion that children displayed very \ncompetent, albeit one-sided, \u2018participations\u2019 in telephone discourse in pretence \nmode before they were able to converse with equally fluent use of linguistic \nresources in dialogue, led me to study telephone talk as emerging in pretence \nplay and evolving in actual telephone dialogue. Pretence play has a central role \nin many accounts of child development (Kohlberg & Fein, 1987). Especially \nrelevant to my study have been Vygotsky\u2019s (1967) notion of pretence play as a \nsphere where children aspire to and even practise skills they are not yet \nJULIA GILLEN  \n174 \nallowed to demonstrate in the arena of adult social life, children\u2019s creativity in \nthe construction of roles and narratives (Garvey, 1977), and the consequent \ndevelopment of sociolinguistic competencies (Andersen, 1990). \nData were collected from spontaneous play with telephones during \nsessions of pretence play by 3 and 4 year-old children in a nursery attached to a \nschool in Lancashire. I also spent considerable time observing, and sometimes \nparticipating in, other activities in the nursery. I recorded and later transcribed \nthe telephone talk of 19 children in the \u2018afternoon group\u2019, who were at the \nnursery throughout the three phases of the study from November 1995 to June \n1996. In the first phase, an unobtrusive small video camera was mounted in a \nchild-size replica of a typical British pavement telephone box with a telephone \ninstalled in it. The activity of the children in and around the telephone was \nrecorded. \nHeeding Bronfenbrenner\u2019s (1979) criticisms of overly artificial designs for \nstudies of child development, I claim a considerable degree of \u2018ecological \nvalidity\u2019 for the study. Although the study was not naturalistic in that the \nresearcher contrived the situation, it was in the nature of opportunity offered \nto the children within which they could choose whether or not, and how to \nparticipate. Following the example of such research into young children\u2019s \ndevelopment of new communicative competencies, as described by Robinson \net al (1981), it was felt necessary that the children\u2019s parents and teachers \nconsidered the opportunity potentially beneficial. The research design was \nconstructed with regard to fitting in to the classroom routine and facilities, to \nthe \u2018human sense\u2019 that was made of it by the children (Donaldson, 1987) and \nto allow sensitive, long-term observation of the children in their own worlds \n(see Corsaro, 1985; Hammersley, 1994). It permitted micro-genetic \nobservation of the activity of children acting with peers and\/or adults that was \na feature of Vygotsky\u2019s (1962, 1987a) work, but was underpinned with the \ncareful discourse analysis of contemporary developmental sociolinguistic \nstudies of pretence play (e.g. Andersen, 1990). \nThe Notion of \u2018Egocentric Speech\u2019 \nPiaget\u2019s proposal of the notion of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 (1959) is well known. He \nsuggested that much of the talk young children utter, which is apparently not \ndirected to another as with adult conversation, is \u2018egocentric\u2019 in character: \n[The child] does not bother to know to whom he is speaking nor whether he is \nbeing listened to. He talks either for himself or for the pleasure of associating \nanyone who happens to be there with the activity of the moment. This talk is ego-\ncentric, partly because the child speaks only about himself, but chiefly because he \ndoes not attempt to place himself at the point of view of his hearer. (Piaget, 1959, \np. 9) \nHe distinguished three categories of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019: repetition or \necholalia, collective monologue, and monologue or \u2018soliloquy\u2019. Research in \nVYGOTSKY\u2019S \u2018EGOCENTRIC SPEECH\u2019  \n175 \nthe 1970s reviewed by Shields (1979) effectively reclassified the first category as \nsocial play, and Shields herself convincingly argued from her own data that \n\u2018collective monologue\u2019 is essentially social: for example, a manifestation of the \nchild learning to cope with the social problem of entering a new type of group \ndynamics such as peer play in a nursery setting. This leaves the kind of \n\u2018egocentric speech\u2019 that Piaget (1959) described as follows: \u2018The child talks to \nhimself as though he were thinking aloud. He does not address anyone\u2019 (p. 9). \nIt might be asserted that this can have nothing to do with (pretence) talking on \nthe telephone, a deliberate fantasy activity in which children delight in \naddressing an imaginary interlocutor. However, I contend that if the \nVygotskian view of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 is taken on board, then the activity of \n\u2018pretence talking on the telephone\u2019 takes on a new significance. \nFollowers of Vygotsky have grasped an essential difference between \nPiaget\u2019s and Vygotsky\u2019s conception of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019, founded upon the \nradical contrast in their depictions of the young child (see, for example, Berk, \n1994; Wertsch & Stone, 1985). For Vygotsky, the genesis of the higher \npsychological functions including language is in social activity. Language is \nused to and in the presence of the child. Processes of communication including \nlanguage are rooted in social interactions. Gradually their meanings are \ninternalised and comprehended linguistically as the child strives actively to \nmake more precisely known her or his concerns and intentions within present \nsocial relations. \u2018Egocentric speech\u2019 develops from an undifferentiated social \nspeech as the child moves toward the later-achieved differentiation of inner \nspeech (verbalised thought) and external, communicative speech function \n(Vygotsky, 1987b, pp. 74, 113). At the age of 3, therefore, there is little \ndifference between \u2018egocentric\u2019 and communicative speech, whereas by age 7, \nthe former is adopting many of the structural characteristics of inner speech \nand thus is easily perceived by observers as very different from directed \nconversational speech (Vygotsky, 1987b, p. 261). For Piaget, \u2018egocentric \nspeech\u2019 atrophied as the child developed into a social being, while for \nVygotsky it \u2018went underground\u2019 and evolved into inner speech (Wertsch & \nStone, 1985, p. 172). Vygotsky himself suggested that it is as absurd to imagine \nthat \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 dies out, as it is to imagine that the ability to count \nvanishes when the child no longer uses fingers or utters numbers aloud \n(Vygotsky, 1987b, p. 261). \nVygotsky\u2019s own series of experimental investigations (as described in \nVygotsky 1962, 1987a; Vygotsky & Luria, 1930) remain particularly persuasive \ndemonstrations of the social nature of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019. He measured \nyoung children\u2019s output of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 while engaged in activities in \nchanging conditions. He agreed with Piaget (1959, p. 9) that children have a \ncertain \u2018illusion of understanding\u2019, that is, with reference to the present \n\u2018audience\u2019, but showed how important this was to the motivation behind \n\u2018egocentric speech\u2019. When the \u2018audience\u2019 was interfered with, for example by \nbeing composed of children the subjects knew to be deaf or not speaking their \nlanguage, or when vocalisations were drowned out by an orchestra recruited \nJULIA GILLEN  \n176 \nto play on the other side of a screen (!), or simply if a subject child is left alone, \nthen the production of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 fell sharply. Thus, Vygotsky\u2019s \nemphasis on the social characteristic of all language in use has received \nconsiderable empirical support. \nVygotsky\u2019s notion of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 is founded in a conception of \nthe acquisition of language as essentially sociocultural, in contrast to the \nChomskian\/nativist emphasis on an innate language capacity unfurled \nthrough maturation with exposure to a specific language (see, for example, \nPinker, 1994). However, beyond its place within a sociocultural account of \nlanguage development, further refinement of the notion of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 \nhas happened in a very particular and, I contend, ultimately somewhat \nmisleading way. Part of Vygotsky\u2019s account has been seized upon in an \nunbalanced way and another part left behind. \nThe function of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 that is now taken by those who are \napplying and even developing Vygotskian ideas, as principal, dominant or even \nessentially sole, is that of a self-regulatory or planning function. I give two \nexamples taken from often-cited Vygotskian research programmes. \nIn a passage in which Wertsch & Stone (1985) interpret Vygotsky\u2019s \nnotion of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019, they seemingly have room for no other aspect of \nfunction: \nVygotsky argued that the reason for the appearance of this intermediate speech \nform is that this new self-regulative function of speech is still not completely \ndifferentiated from earlier social functions. The failure to appreciate the existence \nof this new speech function leads the child temporarily to continue using overt, \nself-regulative speech and to produce such speech in potentially communicative \nsettings. (p. 172) \nWertsch\u2019s (1985) application of Vygotsky\u2019s theories to the study of adult\u2013child \ndialogues is renowned. It is interesting to note that although studies of adult\u2013\nchild dyads frequently cite his work, Vygotsky himself \u2018never discussed these \nsituations and instead focused more upon culture as providing tools for \nthinking\u2019 (Van der Veer & Valsiner, 1994, p. 6). In the chapter co-written with \nStone cited earlier, Wertsch presents an excellent demonstration of how \nmother\u2013child problem-solving dialogue of directed speech becomes \ninternalised into the child planning for herself or himself through the \nintermediate stage of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019. \nThis is the \u2018private speech\u2019 that Berk and her fellow contributors to the \n1992 volume Private Speech: from social interaction to self-regulation, studied. As is \nclear in the title and discussed within the book, Diaz & Berk consider their \nnotion of private speech as self-regulatory to be synonymous with Vygotsky\u2019s \n\u2018egocentric speech\u2019. In studies spanning more than a decade, Berk (1992, 1994) \nfocused on the link between talking to oneself and learning, stressing the idea \nthat self-regulatory or planning speech can be a useful accompaniment to a \ndifficult task, a resource even for adults. Berk (1992, 1994) addressed such \nquestions as: do slow learners use more or less \u2018private speech\u2019 than quick \nVYGOTSKY\u2019S \u2018EGOCENTRIC SPEECH\u2019  \n177 \nlearners; do some cultural groups tend to use it more or less than others; and \nshould we respond to any such difference with intervention? These are \nworthwhile areas of enquiry. \nMy intention is to focus on Berk\u2019s notion of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 as a \nreflection of Vygotsky\u2019s, as it is a relationship that Berk claims. Berk (1994) says \nthat \u2018self-guidance is the central function of private speech\u2019 (p. 62) and cites \nVygotsky for her argument that \u2018private speech facilitates self-regulation\u2019 (p. \n63). Her evidence occasionally includes other, quite different roles that private \nspeech can play including \u2018fantasy play\u2019 and \u2018emotional release\u2019, but it is as an \naccompaniment to action, a form of self-direction that she and Wertsch & \nStone (1985) consider to be of prime importance. What a surprise, then, to find \nthat Vygotsky (1987b) actually wrote of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019: \u2018It is not an \naccompaniment of the child\u2019s activity\u2019 (p. 259). What is the explanation for the \napparent contradiction here? \nIt is true that in their writings Vygotsky and indeed Piaget stressed the \naspect of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 that is self-regulatory and indeed some kind of a \ncommentary on action. This led to an emphasis by followers (including early \ntranslators of Vygotsky) on this function. However, I suggest that this aspect \nreceived particular attention because of the comparative novelty of the \nsuggestion. This was the era when both men were drawing on each other\u2019s \nwork with mutual respect and it is useful to remember the long shadow cast \nover all serious students of child psychology by Freud. In relation to Piaget, \nthis influence is emphasised by Kohlberg & Fein (1987, p. 393) and in relation \nto Vygotsky, received its clearest acknowledgement in his short piece written \nwith Luria (Vygotsky & Luria), made available in 1994. The internal life of the \nchild in imagination and the significance of unconscious impulses were greatly \nappreciated by the 1930s (as in the present day, considered necessarily \ninaccessible to precise, quantifiable research methodologies). Reading \nVygotsky\u2019s extensive writings on \u2018egocentric speech\u2019, I find a more well-\nrounded account than in the selective presentations of Berk (1992, 1994) and \nWertsch & Stone (1985), who have tended to regard the ideas of Piaget and \nVygotsky as requiring less justification in their discussions of \u2018egocentric \nspeech\u2019. In many passages, Vygotsky passes quickly over an acceptance of the \nimaginative, expressive nature of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 in order to present the \ncomparatively newly recognised aspect of a sometimes present self-regulatory \nfunction: \nEgocentric speech may, in fact, function as a component of realistic thinking. \nEgocentric speech may be fused not with the logic of dream or fantasy but with the \nlogic of rational, goal-directed action and thinking. (Vygotsky, 1987b, p. 73) \nThis second type of \u2018logic\u2019 received most attention by Vygotsky as previously \nhaving been overlooked. Later commentators follow his line of emphasis, \nidentified in passages such as: \nAlongside the purely expressive function of egocentric speech, its tendency to \nsimply accompany the child\u2019s activity, this process becomes thinking in the true \nJULIA GILLEN  \n178 \nsense of the term. It assumes the function of a planning operation or the function \nof resolving a problem that arises in behaviour. (Vygotsky, 1987b, p. 114) \nTherefore, attention to \u2018the logic of dream and fantasy\u2019, and \u2018the purely \nexpressive function\u2019 of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 came to be overlooked. Much of \nVygotsky\u2019s writing on \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 emphasises the role of \u2018egocentric \nspeech\u2019 in accompanying cognitively challenging activities. Moreover, this \npath has been developed so fruitfully by Berk, as discussed earlier. \nHowever, Vygotsky\u2019s (1987b) clearest summary passage paints a more \nholistic picture of the role of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019: \nthe function of egocentric speech is closely related to the function of inner speech. It \nis not an accompaniment of the child\u2019s activity. It is an independent melody or \nfunction that facilitates intellectual orientation, conscious awareness, the \novercoming of difficulties and impediments, and imagination and thinking. It is \nspeech for oneself (a speech function that intimately serves the child\u2019s thinking). \nThe genetic fate of egocentric speech is much different from that depicted by \nPiaget. Egocentric speech develops along not a falling but a rising curve. Its \ndevelopment is not an involution but a true evolution ... Our hypothesis suggests \nthat egocentric speech is speech that is internal in its mental function and external \nin its structure. It is fated to develop into inner speech. (pp. 259\u2013260) \nPretence Telephone Talk \nA return to the data is surely overdue. Before any analysis of the content of \nwhat Katie says, I need to consider whether the phenomenon of pretence play \nwith a telephone in the context of a discussion can be seen as \u2018egocentric \nspeech\u2019. If Vygotsky\u2019s analysis is accepted, then the data are of a highly \nrelevant nature. \nIf a young child picks up a telephone and plays with it, then it is not \nnecessary to speak into it. As one might expect from Vygotsky\u2019s emphasis on \nthe sociocultural nature of language acquisition, children have been observed \nvocalising \u2018correctly\u2019 (i.e. making sounds only when holding the telephone up \nnear the head, directing noise in the area of the mouthpiece) from as young as \n14 months old. I have a video recording of such a child, Laura (Gillen, 1997a), \nplaying in this way with a telephone for the duration of over 1 minute. Later, \nwhen children clearly understand the communicative function of a connected \ntelephone and differentiate their own toy from which no voice will ever \nemerge, they choose to couch their pretence talk in the framework of \ntelephone discourse. The data from this study revealed knowledge of the \nanatomy of telephone calls drawn upon in pretence and dialogic constructions \n(Gillen, 1998). The most necessary elements of telephone discourse: openings, \nclosings and signs of turn-taking, (Schegloff & Sacks, 1973; Schegloff, 1979; \nHopper, 1992) appear early and continue to structure later talk until and long \nafter it becomes as complicated as Katie\u2019s. \nVYGOTSKY\u2019S \u2018EGOCENTRIC SPEECH\u2019  \n179 \nKatie\u2019s pretence telephone call is rare amongst data collected in this \nstudy in that it does not begin with \u2018hello\u2019 or \u2018hiya\u2019. As with most such calls, \nfurther examination does reveal recognition of the need for an opening in \nmore than one way. For Katie\u2019s opening \u2018Mummy\u2019 has something in the \nnature of the vocative about it, the address that can begin a speech directed to \nanother (as particularly clearly evidenced in Latin with its use of the vocative \ninflection). After she has made a contentful statement, Katie brings the call to a \nclose with \u2018goodbye\u2019 and prepares to replace the receiver. As was the case for a \nnumber of children in other pretence calls, preparing to replace the receiver \nseemed to trigger a self-correction; a realization that the rapid delivery of the \nstrongly motivated \u2018message\u2019 caused an omission of the proper preliminaries. \nThe use of the \u2018vocative\u2019 is now felt to have been not quite an adequate \nopening. Accordingly, Katie started again, lifting the receiver and dialling \n(again a virtually ubiquitous precursor to a pretence call). \nThis time she says \u2018Hello\u2019, dials again and makes what I came to regard \nas the canonical short pretence call: beginning with \u2018Hello\u2019, ending in \u2018bye\u2019, \nwith merely monosyllabic phatic acknowledgements or signs of turn-taking in \nbetween (I borrow the notion of a canonical call from Hopper\u2019s 1992 \ninductively derived work on canonical constituents of adults\u2019 telephone calls). \nIn a sense, her mission of making a pretence telephone call is now complete. \nOn many occasions, pretence calls of this nature and structure seemingly \nsatisfied the children\u2019s impulses. However, on this occasion, something else \ncame to the front of her internal life that required final expression. I am not \ngoing to be so literal minded as to assert that Katie\u2019s mother was necessarily ill \nat that time and that Katie was expressing her real anxiety. It seems to be that \npretending to talk to her mother has brought the figure of her mother firmly \ninto her imagination and she ended expressing a thought about her. Mothers \nwere very frequently the characterisations evoked as imaginary interlocutors \nand this occurred almost automatically, even if the call contained only the \nbasic structural elements identified earlier. \nHere I think it very possible that Katie\u2019s original motivation to express \nherself came from her recognition of the fact that \u2018tidy up time\u2019 had come, the \nprecursor of activities connected with getting ready to go home, while she felt \nsomewhat frustrated in the curtailment of her play activities. The pretence \ntelephone offered a stimulus to her to express this idea \u2013 and emotion \u2013 \nverbally: a kind of encouraging force or even amplifier (and literally so) of \n\u2018egocentric speech\u2019. \nSociocultural knowledge of the structure of telephone calls is brought \ninto the structuring of expression in pretence telephone calls. The socially \nconventional routines of telephone discourse, the dialogic skills of turn-taking \nand addressing, even responding to the other, and not least the imaginative \nand emotional evocations and activities belonging to the realm of pretence \nplay become the resources that children draw upon when constructing \ntelephone talk. Katie\u2019s \u2018call\u2019 is perhaps two or more attempts at making a call, \neach with its opening, closing and some appropriate mid-part. Her pauses, the \nJULIA GILLEN  \n180 \nconstruction of her turns, are at least as significant an achievement as the \nsemantic content of her utterances, in interactional terms. Children re-create \nthe communicative routines they link to recognised contexts, often pushing \nthe boundaries of their pre-existing linguistic abilities as they do so (Bloom, \n1993; Gillen, 1997a). The act of the 14 month-old Laura in lifting the telephone \nreceiver and vocalising into it, a sound that will soon become \u2018hello\u2019, is a \nmanifestation of children actively making use of resources given substance and \nform by the culture around them. \nConclusions \nWhether it is fair to judge pretence calls as exemplars of \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 or \nnot does not finally matter too much. I have made a case that pretence \ntelephone calls may be regarded in this light. Talking on a telephone that the \nchild knows will bring about no actual response is a kind of performance for \noneself. Thus, explanations of pretence calls as manifestations of \u2018egocentric \nspeech\u2019 can make use of Vygotsky\u2019s account of the social genesis of speech. \nAnalysis of children\u2019s talk to themselves, while allowing them to \nmaintain control over that world, has the potential to illuminate their route to \ncommunicative competence in a holistic way. This \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 \ninvolves more than either the acquisition of particular routines or the \novercoming of cognitive challenges, important as these are. \u2018Egocentric \nspeech\u2019 is constituted by the expression of the child\u2019s imagination in an \nenvironment that is profoundly coloured by subjective perceptions and \nrelationships, and given potential forms through culturally derived \ninterpretations. \nThe reader might prefer a weaker case, in which I succeed in drawing \nsome links between the manifestations of pretence play that I studied and \n\u2018egocentric speech\u2019. In this event, I can draw attention to something of a \npossible bridge in the work of Shields (1979), who studied \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 \nas it arose in the course of spontaneous play among pre-schooler children. She \ncharacterised imaginative monologues (i.e. Piaget\u2019s category of \u2018monologue\u2019 \n[soliloquy]; see earlier), as follows: \nThe monologues seems [sic] to be typical examples of elaborated play in which \nthe experiences of reality are brought in to structure the current activity. \nThis process may take place in play interaction, or it may be exhibited as in these \nmonologues entirely under the control of the child. (Shields, 1979, p. 265; my \nemphasis) \nThese words are an apposite description of what I found in the children\u2019s \ntelephone calls, across both the pretence and dialogic conditions. How socially \noriented any utterance might be deemed was a far more complex issue than \nsimply whether or not the telephone was connected to another person. Katie \nalmost automatically addressed her mother in her pretence call. This then \nbrought that figure into the foreground of subject matter, demanding some \nVYGOTSKY\u2019S \u2018EGOCENTRIC SPEECH\u2019  \n181 \nkind of expression. Shields\u2019s formulation brings out the interaction between \nthe \u2018pretence\u2019 and the \u2018real\u2019 world as they are brought together in the unified \n(in another sense) existence of the child and suggests how speech routines of \nculturally defined discourses, here telephone discourse, are used as essential \nlinguistic resources. For these are the structuring experiences of reality, as they \nappear in language. \nPretence calls, as \u2018egocentric speech\u2019, may occur in the presence of \nadults. However, neither are they elicited nor under adults\u2019 control. They \nbelong to the child, and sometimes, to the world of pretence play they inhabit \nwith peers. Having regard to children\u2019s private speech hardly fits the current \nemphasis in the United Kingdom pre-school system upon children\u2019s output, \nupon their successfully achieved communications, with adults above all. \nIt is often believed that Vygotsky\u2019s work did not reach the West until the \n1960s, and is essentially \u2018true\u2019 in that attention slowly started to build after the \ninitial publication of an English translation of Thought and Language in 1962. It \nhas generally been overlooked that in 1929 Vygotsky sent a report on his \ninvestigations into \u2018egocentric speech\u2019 to the Ninth International Congress of \nPsychology at New Haven, concluding: \u2018We thus consider egocentric speech \nas one of the most important processes having a specific function in the \nevolution of the cultural behavior of the child\u2019 (Vygotsky & Luria, 1930, p. \n465). \nNote \nAn earlier version of this article was presented to the British Educational \nResearch Association annual conference in Belfast, August 1998.
