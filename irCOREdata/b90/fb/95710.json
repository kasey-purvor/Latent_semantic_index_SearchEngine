Cross-national \nvariation in the level of (re)distributive transfers has generated significant research (e.g. Alesina, \nGlaeser, Sacerdote, 2001; Bawn and Rosenbluth, 2006; Iversen and Soskice, 2006; Lizzeri and \nPersico, 2001; Milesi-Ferreti, Rostagno and Perotti, 2001; Persson and Tabellini, 1999, 2000, \n2003). Variation in transfer form has received relatively less scholarly attention.  \nDistributive transfers provide particularistic benefits to select groups (Collie, 1988). In \npractice, these groups may be more or less select. Broadly targeted transfers provide benefits to \nlarge groups of individuals who share general attributes. Examples of broad transfers include \nunemployment benefits made available to all persons regardless of their occupation or previous \nindustry of employment and pensions available to all persons of a certain age (Verdier, 1995). In \ncontrast, narrowly targeted transfers provide benefits only to very select segments of the \nelectorate. For example, industry-specific subsidies benefit only those voters whose assets (land, \nlabor, or capital) are employed in the privileged industry. Although distributive transfers take \nmany forms, they can generally be characterized as being either broad or narrow.  \nGovernments\u2019 portfolios of distributive policies typically include both broad and narrow \ntransfers. However, it is frequently the case that one type of transfer tends to be privileged over \nthe other. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s portfolio of distributive policies during the late \n1960s and early 1970s consisted primarily of narrow transfers. During this period, politicians \nimplemented policies whose explicit objectives were to provide select benefits to narrow groups, \nsuch as individual industries and firms (Sharp and Shepherd, 1987). In contrast, Germany\u2019s \nportfolio of distributive policies consisted almost exclusively of broad transfers during this \n \n \nStrategic targeting 2 \n \nperiod. Transfers were generally made available to all industries in the manufacturing sector \nrather than a select few (Shepherd and Duchene, 1983). In fact, German governments routinely \nrefused to provide transfers to individual firms or industries during this period (Schatz and \nWolter, 1987). Instead, politicians focused on building a comprehensive framework of broadly \ntargeted distributive transfers, called the Soziale Marktwirtschaft (Sharp and Shepherd, 1987).  \n Cross-national differences in transfer form persist today despite increased economic \nintegration and restrictions on certain types of transfers embodied in international agreements \nlike the World Trade Organization and the European Union. How can the variation in the form of \ndistributive transfers across countries be explained?  \nThe form of distributive transfers in a given country is influenced by both domestic \ninstitutions and domestic interests. Two sets of interests are of critical importance for transfer \nform: the economic interests of voters and the political interests of office holders and office \nseekers. Politicians prefer the transfer type with the greatest electoral benefits. The electoral \nbenefits politicians gain from providing either broad or narrow transfers depend critically on \nvoters\u2019 preferences over transfer form and the country\u2019s electoral rules. Voters prefer the transfer \ntype that maximizes their income. The electoral rules shape the nature of electoral competition \nand identify those voters whose preferences matter the most for politicians\u2019 reelection chances. \nTaken together, electoral institutions and domestic interests shape the form of distributive \ntransfers.  \nExamining the joint effect of domestic interests and institutions on the form distributive \ntransfers makes several important contributions to our understanding of the politics of \n(re)distribution. First, it provides a new empirical test of an important hypothesis proposed in the \nliterature, namely that electoral rules affect the form of distributive transfers. Although this \n \n \nStrategic targeting 3 \n \nhypothesis has received considerable scholarly attention to date, it has been subjected to few \nempirical tests because of the difficulty of measuring transfer form. Second, this research \nintroduces domestic interests to existing institutional explanations of transfer form. Domestic \ninterests have been frequently overlooked in studies of the cross-national variance in transfer \nform (e.g. Lizzeri and Persico, 2001; Persson and Tabellini, 1999). Ignoring domestic interests \nmay be relatively innocuous if politicians elected via different rules are equally responsive to \nvoters\u2019 demands for various types of distributive transfers. If politicians elected via a particular \nset of rules are more responsive to voters\u2019 preferences over transfer form, overlooking voter \ndemand may lead to inaccurate conclusions about the causal mechanism linking electoral rules to \ntransfer form and inaccurate predictions of the effect of electoral rules. In short, taking \ninstitutions and interests together provides a more complete and accurate understanding of the \nprovision of different types of transfers by electorally minded parties and politicians. \nExisting explanations \n A large and sophisticated literature points to the importance of electoral institutions for \ntransfer form (e.g. Lizzeri and Persico, 2001; Milesi-Ferreti, Rostagno and Perotti, 2001; Persson \nand Tabellini, 1999, 2000, 2003). In these studies, politicians (and parties) are generally assumed \nto be office-seeking. To maximize their chances of reelection, politicians work to target \ndistributive transfers to those voters most critical to their reelection chances. The identity of \nthese voters is determined by the country\u2019s electoral rules. For example, the voters most critical \nto a politician\u2019s reelection chances in a plurality-rule, single-member district system are those in \nthe politician\u2019s geographically-defined electoral district. Under plurality electoral rules, \npoliticians are assumed to need 50 percent plus one of the votes to win reelection. To secure this \noutcome, politicians\u2019 optimal strategy is to provide transfers targeted to only those voters in their \n \n \nStrategic targeting 4 \n \nelectoral districts (Persson and Tabellini, 1999, 2000, 2003). This is also true for parties \ncompeting in two-party plurality rule systems with single-member districts.  \nMajoritarian electoral rules tend to be closely associated with single-member electoral \ndistricts. This empirical regularity provides further incentives for electorally minded politicians \n(and parties) in majoritarian systems to provide narrow transfers. Single member districts tend to \nbe smaller than multimember districts (Powell and Vanberg, 2000). The influence of narrow, \nparticularistic groups is greater in smaller districts (Alt and Gilligan, 1994; Magee, Brock and \nYoung, 1989; Mansfield and Busch, 1995; Rogowski, 1997). McGillivray (2004: 28) provides \nthe following illustrative example: An industry with 100 employees represents 10 percent of the \nelectorate in a district with 1,000 voters. The same industry represents only 0.1 percent of the \nelectorate in a district of 100,000 voters. In the larger district, refusing to provide targeted \nbenefits to the industry is unlikely to affect the politician\u2019s reelection chances because the \nindustry is only 0.1 percent of the representative\u2019s electorate. As a result, the smaller electoral \ndistricts (both in terms of seats and size) typically found in majoritarian systems provide \npoliticians with additional electoral incentives to target benefits to narrow segments of the \nelectorate. \nIn proportional systems, politicians and parties are believed to have fewer electoral \nincentives to supply narrow transfers (Lizzeri and Persico, 2001; Persson and Tabellini, 2003; \nRogowski, 1987, 1997). Parties competing under proportional electoral rules do not win elections \ndistrict by district. As such, no single district is critical to the electoral success of a party \n(McGillivray, 2004). Instead, parties work to maximize their aggregate vote share because this \ndetermines the number of legislative seats the party will control. By targeting transfers to a broad \nsegment of the electorate, parties are able to \u201cbuy\u201d the electoral support of a wide range of voters \n \n \nStrategic targeting 5 \n \ndispersed across electoral districts. This is precisely the type of electoral support that is most \nbeneficial to parties competing in multi-member districts under proportional rule. \nTo illustrate this, consider the following example. If a country has an unemployment rate \nof 10 percent, a party could potentially secure 10 percent of the national vote share by promising \nincreased unemployment benefits. However, such a transfer might buy 3 percent of the vote \nshare in one district and 30 percent in another, depending on the pattern of unemployment. This \ncross-district disparity does not matter to parties competing in proportional (PR) systems. \nHowever, for parties in two-party, plurality systems it is wasteful to buy votes this way. They \nwill massively overbuy in some districts obtaining much more than the necessary 50 percent plus \none votes needed to win under plurality electoral rules.   \nIn sum, existing research on the form of distributive transfers focuses primarily on the \nimportance of electoral rules. The general expectation derived from much of this research is that \nmajoritarian systems will have more narrow transfers than PR systems. Although empirical tests \nof this expectation are limited because of the dearth of cross-nationally comparable measures of \ntransfer form, the evidence that does exist is mixed. For example, Persson and Tabellini (2003) \nfind that PR systems spend relatively more on broad transfers, measured by government \nspending on social security and welfare spending as a percentage of GDP. In contrast, Rogowski \nand Kayser (2002), and Rogowski, Chang, and Kayser (2005) find evidence to suggest that PR \nsystems provide relatively more narrow transfers. They find that proportional electoral systems \nare associated with higher levels of consumer prices. Higher consumer prices may reflect narrow \ntransfers delivered to particular groups, such as individual industries (Bawn and Rosenbluth \n2006, 262).  \n \n \nStrategic targeting 6 \n \nSimple two-country comparisons are also ambiguous. For example, the United Kingdom \nand Belgium both targeted approximately 50 percent of their manufacturing transfers to \nindividual industries during the 1990s, according to the Commission of the European \nCommunities\u2019 Survey on State Aid (2002), despite the fact that they have dissimilar electoral \ninstitutions. Furthermore, the amount spent on narrow transfers relative to broad has changed \nover time in the United Kingdom although the country\u2019s electoral rules have remained constant \n(Commission of the European Communities\u2019 Survey on State Aid, 2002). The pattern of \ndistributive transfers across countries and over time suggests that electoral institutions alone \ncannot fully explain the observed variation in transfer form. Domestic interests must also be \ntaken into consideration.  \nArgument \nDomestic interests and electoral institutions shape the form of distributive transfers. \nPoliticians interested in maximizing their chances of (re)election work to provide the type of \ntransfer with the greatest electoral benefits. The electoral benefits of different types of transfers \nare jointly determined by the country\u2019s electoral rules and voters\u2019 preferences over transfer form. \nVoters prefer the type of transfer that maximizes their income. The type of transfer that \nmaximizes voters\u2019 income depends critically on their mobility. Voters that find it prohibitively \ncostly to move to a new group prefer transfers that target benefits only to their current group. The \noptimal transfer for \u2018immobile\u2019 voters would provide benefits to their group up to the point \nwhere marginal benefit equals the group\u2019s share of marginal cost and no benefits at all to any \nother group (Bawn and Rosenbluth, 2006: 253). Voters able to move freely between groups are \nrelatively less interested in narrowly targeted transfers.  In short, voters\u2019 preferences over \n \n \nStrategic targeting 7 \n \ntransfer form depend critically on their mobility and more precisely the mobility of their income \nearning assets.  \nMobility, particularly with respect to factors of production such as land, labor, and \ncapital, plays a critical role in theories of trade politics (e.g. Hiscox, 2002; Jones, 1971: \nO\u2019Rourke and Sinnott, 2001; Rogowski, 1989; Stolper and Samuelson, 1941). Indeed, factor \nmobility is regarded as crucial for understanding the political-economic origins of a wide range \nof trade and industrial policies, since the economic interests of asset owners are shaped by their \nability to shift assets between uses (Grossman and Levinsohn, 1989). Factor mobility reflects the \ncosts of moving assets, such as land, labor or capital, between uses in the domestic economy. \nThese costs are often referred to as adjustment costs. I focus here on the adjustment costs facing \nworkers because in most countries, the median voter earns the majority of their income from \nlabor rather than land or capital assets (Kono, 2007; Mayer, 1984).i The costs of adjustment \nfacing workers include the search costs involved in finding a new job, the costs of re-training, the \npotential obsolescence of their skills, and the loss of rents specific to their current job.  \nWorkers\u2019 preferences over transfer form vary systematically with the adjustment costs \nthey face (Alt et al., 1996; Verdier, 1995; Zahariadis, 2001). Workers facing high adjustment \ncosts prefer narrowly targeted transfers. The current and future incomes of workers stuck in their \ncurrent industry because of prohibitively high adjustment costs are tied directly to the profits of \nthe industry (or firm) in which they currently work. If the fortunes of that industry decline, \nworkers unable to leave because of high adjustment costs receive lower rates of return. Given \nthis, workers facing high adjustment costs are particularly concerned with protecting the returns \nin the industry in which they are currently employed.   \n \n \nStrategic targeting 8 \n \nAlthough both broad and narrow transfers could, in theory, serve to insulate industry \nreturns from market pressures, narrow transfers are preferred to broad transfers because they \nmaximize the incomes of immobile (specific) workers. The rents generated by narrow transfers \nare shared among fewer people than those from broad transfers. As such, the per-person benefits \nof narrow transfers are greater than the per-person benefits of broad transfers (Alt and Gilligan, \n1994: 182). Furthermore, these benefits tend not to be arbitrated away by new entrants because \nof the high barriers to entry that exist in industries characterized by specific workers (Frieden, \n1991). Workers employed in other industries need to invest resources to obtain the skills required \nto enter the privileged industry. If the rents are high enough, workers may be willing to make \nsuch an investment. However, acquiring such skills takes time. In the short term, the skills \nrequired for employment in industries characterized by specific labor prevents workers from \nrushing into the industry to take advantage of industry-specific rents.  \nNarrowly targeted transfers are less beneficial to mobile workers. Narrow transfers, such \nas industry-specific subsidies and\/or trade protections, benefit only those workers currently \nemployed in the privileged industry. If workers move out of that industry to take a new job, they \nloose the benefits of the narrow transfer, which instead becomes a pure tax. Given this, the \nexpected benefits of narrow transfers are discounted by voters that are able to move out of a \ngiven industry with relative ease.ii Mobile workers prefer broad programs that allocate benefits \nto large segments of the labor market without reference to industry or occupation. Such programs \nallow workers to continue to enjoy the benefits even after moving to a new industry.  \nThe preferences of individual workers\u2019 over transfer form vary with the adjustment costs \nthey face. Does this individual-level variation produce systematic variation across countries? \nThere are several reasons to expect so. First, workers in a given country face a set of common \n \n \nStrategic targeting 9 \n \nadjustment costs. These common costs stem from country-specific characteristics, such as the \nlevel of industrialization and the regulatory barriers to occupational and geographic relocation \nimposed by federal and local governments (Edin and Zetterberg, 1992; Fung and Staiger, 1996; \nHiscox and Burgoon, 2000; Krueger and Summers, 1987; Parsons, 1972). For example, early \nstages of industrialization often bring major innovations in transportation that lower the cost of \nlabor movement and diminish the importance of geography to the economy (Hiscox, 2002). This \nis evident even in small countries such as Belgium where the extension of the rail network in the \nlate 1800s dramatically increased labor movement between regions and sectors (Huberman, \n2004). Technological innovations in methods of production also have important implications for \ncountry-specific adjustment costs. The introduction of labor-saving technology and production \nline technology increases the ease with which workers can shift between manufacturing \nindustries (Sokoloff, 1986). These technological innovations also increase the demand for \nunskilled workers thereby lowering the costs of moving into the industrial sector from other \nsectors of the economy, like agriculture. Later stages of industrialization, often characterized by \nmoves from assembly-line to continuous-process technology and dramatic technological \nadvances in robotics, required more skilled workers thereby increasing the costs of adjustment \n(Hiscox, 2002).iii  \nSome portion of the total adjustment costs facing any given worker is common to all \nworkers in that country, regardless of their individual characteristics. It is these common \nadjustment costs vary cross-nationally and can explain in part the incentives for politicians to \nprovide one type of distributive transfer rather than another. Politicians are more willing to \nsupply a particular type of transfer where there is greater voter demand for it.  \n \n \nStrategic targeting 10 \n \nLike Bailey (2001), Broz (2005), and others, I assume that voters need not organize for \ntheir economic interests to shape policy outcomes. This is because rival politicians have \nincentives to activate latent interests if elected representatives pay too little attention to them \n(Arnold, 1992; Bailey, 2001; Denzau and Munger, 1986). Rational legislators forestall such \nattacks by serving these voters preemptively. As a result, voters need not mobilize, organize or \nunionize for their economic interests to shape the form of distributive transfers.iv Politicians \ncalculate the distributional effects of different transfer types on the voting constituencies within \ntheir districts. They then work to provide the type of transfers that reflect these interests, even in \nthe absence of direct voter influence, organization or lobbying. \nHowever, voters\u2019 economic interests are only one factor that determines the electoral \nbenefits of providing narrowly targeted transfers. Electoral institutions also matter. The primary \ncausal mechanism linking electoral rules and transfer form in previous research is electoral \ncompetition, as discussed above. There is, however, another causal mechanism through which \nelectoral institutions may influence transfer form that has gone largely unnoticed due to the lack \nof attention to voters\u2019 interests, namely responsiveness. Politicians elected via different rules \nmay vary in their responsiveness to voters\u2019 preferences. For example, Powell and Vanberg \n(2000) argue that politicians in PR systems are more responsive to voters\u2019 preferences than \nvoters in majoritarian systems. They demonstrate that a closer correspondence exists between the \nmedian voter\u2019s preferences and those of the median legislator in PR systems (Powell and \nVanberg, 2000). One explanation for this may be that the position of the median voter is more \nclosely represented by a party in multi-party PR systems, as demonstrated by Cox (1990). If \npoliticians in PR systems are more responsive to voters\u2019 preferences, increased demand for \n \n \nStrategic targeting 11 \n \nnarrow transfers should result in relatively larger increases in the number of narrow transfers in \nPR systems, as compared to majoritarian systems.  \nIn addition to being more responsive, politicians in PR systems may also be better able to \nprovide narrow transfers in response to surges in voter demand for these types of transfers. One \nreason for this may be that PR systems tend to have more veto players than majoritarian systems \n(Cox and McCubbins, 2001). If each veto player is interested in passing a narrow transfer for a \ndifferent constituency, the chances of success for any given demand may be quite high as each \nplayer promises support for others\u2019 narrow transfers in return for support for their own (Cox and \nMcCubbins, 2001). The higher frequency of multi-party coalitions in PR systems may also \nincrease the ability of politicians to respond to surges in demand for narrow transfers. Previous \nresearch demonstrates that multi-party coalitions behave differently than single-party coalitions, \neven when the same interests are represented (Bawn and Rosenbluth, 2006). While single-party \ngovernments are held accountable for all of their policy decisions (Cox, 1990), parties in a multi-\nparty coalition governments are less accountable given the difficulty of assigning blame to any \nsingle party in a coalition government. Multi-party governments are likely able to provide many \nmore narrow transfers than single-party governments because although the costs of providing \nmany narrow transfers may be detrimental to the country as a whole, each party in a coalition \ngovernment can shirk responsibility for these costs.v  \nBecause politicians elected via proportional rules tend to be relatively more responsive to \nvoters\u2019 preferences and may be better able to supply narrow transfers, I expect increased voter \ndemand for narrow transfers to have a relatively larger effect on the number of narrow transfers \nin PR countries, holding all else constant. As voter demand for narrow transfers grows, the \nnumber of narrow transfers should increase in both PR and majoritarian countries. However, the \n \n \nStrategic targeting 12 \n \nincrease should be relatively larger in PR countries, all else equal. I test this expectation using \ntwo new measures of narrow transfers discussed in the following section.  \nEmpirical measures \nEmpirical research on transfer form has been limited due to the dearth of cross-nationally \ncomparable measures. Generating comparable measures of transfer form is difficult given the \nmyriad of distributive policies including subsidies, regulations, taxes, and trade policies. An ideal \nmeasure of narrow transfers would estimate the total amount of all such transfers provided by \nany type of policy. However, such a measure has proven virtually impossible to construct (Bawn \nand Rosenbluth, 2006; Duchene and Shepherd, 1987; McGillivray, 2004; Meny and Wright, \n1986). In an attempt to overcome this limitation, Rogowski and Kayser (2002) use national price \nlevels to estimate aggregate economic distortions caused by distributive policies. Similarly, \nMcGillivray (2004) uses industry stock prices in an attempt to measure industry protection. One \nadvantage of these measures is that they arguably capture the different types of targeted \ntransfers. However, these measures also capture many other factors that have nothing to do with \n(re)distribution or transfer form , such as transportation costs and market size (McGillivray, \n2004; Rodrigez and Rodrik, 2000). \nMeasuring only one kind of narrow transfer has proven no easier. For example, cross-\nnational comparisons of industry subsidies are believed to be suspect even where the bases seem \nto relate to the same categories of expenditures (Duchene and Shepherd, 1987). Furthermore, \ngovernment expenditures on subsidies generally do not convey the focused impact of selective \nmeasures, which is the concept of interest here.  \nGiven these difficulties, it is no surprise then that existing measures of narrow transfers \nare rather rudimentary. Milesi-Ferretti et al. (2002), for example, estimate government spending \n \n \nStrategic targeting 13 \n \non narrowly targeted transfers using the sum of social security payments and other transfers to \nfamilies, plus subsidies to firms. Persson and Tabellini (2003) operationalize targeted transfers as \ngovernment spending on pensions and unemployment insurance payments. Both measures have \nserious drawbacks. The first conflates more narrowly targeted transfers with broader transfers. \nThe second closely approximates the operational definition of broad (rather than narrow) \ntransfers used here. The limitations of these and other existing measures illustrate the difficulty \nof estimating the frequency and generosity of narrowly targeted transfers in a cross-nationally \ncomparable manner.vi    \nIn an attempt to overcome these measurement limitations, I use two novel measures of \nnarrow transfers made possible by international monitoring of domestic transfers. International \nagreements, like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the World Trade Organization, \nand the European Union limit the ways in which national governments can target distribution. \nFor example, rules negotiated as part of the GATT\/WTO restrict the provision of narrow \ntransfers to select segments of a country\u2019s economy. As early as the Tokyo Round of 1979, the \nuse of narrowly targeted subsidies by national governments was restricted by Articles VI, XVI \nand XXIII.  Since then, international restrictions on narrow domestic transfers have been \nsignificantly strengthened, clarified, and expanded. For example, The WTO Agreement on \nSubsidies and Countervailing Measures (Articles 1 through 9) explicitly bans government \nsubsidies targeted exclusively to individual industries or firms in the manufacturing sector.  \nDespite these restrictions, some governments choose to provide narrow transfers in \nviolation of their international treaty obligations.vii The provision of illegal narrow transfers is \nmonitored by international producers. Narrow transfers provided to a single industry in one \ncountry increase the competitiveness of that industry\u2019s products on the international market. \n \n \nStrategic targeting 14 \n \nProducers facing this increased competition will sound a \u201cfire alarm\u201d in their respective country \n(McCubbins and Schwartz, 1984) lobbying their home government to take action at the \ninternational level. Such action can take one of two forms. First, extra duties (i.e. countervailing \nduties) can be imposed against illegally subsidized products. Second, formal complaints can be \nfiled with the GATT\/WTO Dispute Settlement Body. Complaints may seek both the withdrawal \nof the illegal narrow transfer and compensation for its adverse effects. \nCountervailing duties (CVDs) and complaints filed over narrow transfers are used here to \nestimate the relative frequency of narrowly targeted transfers in defendant countries.viii \nArguably, countries facing more CVDs and complaints have more narrow transfers. Of course, \nthere are many factors which influence the circumstances under which countries choose to \nimpose CVDs or file complaints (Allee, 2005; Reinhardt, 2000). Given this, it is unlikely that \nevery instance of narrow transfers is captured by these measures. However, there is no reason to \nbelieve that this cuts in favor of the argument made here. In fact, the non-random noise contained \nin these measures of narrow transfers likely makes it more difficult to find support for my \nargument. \nAlthough the vast majority of all complaints filed with the GATT\/WTO have at issue a \nnarrowly targeted transfer (80 percent during the period from 1980-1994; 66 percent during \n1995-2003), I systematically code and exclude complaints filed over other issues to increase the \nvalidity of this measure. Details on the coding criteria and exclusion decisions are reported in \nAppendix A.  \nMeasuring voters\u2019 preferences over transfer form is equally difficult. Voters facing high \nadjustment costs prefer narrow transfers, as argued above. To estimate the common adjustment \ncosts facing workers in a given country, I measure the dispersion in wages across industries by \n \n \nStrategic targeting 15 \n \ncalculating the coefficient of variation for wage rates across manufacturing industries.ix Data are \nfrom Freeman and Oostendorp\u2019s Occupational Wages around the World (OWW) Database. \nThese data benefit from an improved version of Freeman and Oostendorp\u2019s (2002) \nstandardization procedure, which includes country-specific data correction factors.x  \nThe dispersion in wages across industries (inter-industry wage differentials) is a \ncommonly used and widely accepted measure of labor specificity (e.g. Dickens and Katz, 1987; \nEdin and Zetterberg, 1992; Gibbons and Katz, 1992; Hiscox, 2002; Katz and Summers, 1989; \nKrueger and Summers, 1987). This measure is favored because it closely approximates the \ntheoretical concept of interest (the elasticity of substitution), which is not itself directly \nobservable (Hiscox, 2002). The assumption is that when adjustment costs are low, wage \ndifferentials should be arbitraged away by the movement of workers between industries. \nWorkers have incentives to move between industries in order to maximize their income. They do \nso only when the costs of adjustment are not prohibitively high. The movement of workers \nbetween industries (or even just the potential for it) should equalize returns to similar types of \nworkers across industries.xi High inter-industry wage differentials are therefore taken as evidence \nof high adjustment costs.  \nAlthough inter-industry wage differentials are widely used to estimate labor specificity, \nthere are reasons to exercise caution when using this measure. Most fundamentally, some part of \ninter-industry wage differentials may reflect heterogeneity in labor skill levels rather than actual \nadjustment costs. To minimize this possibility, I calculate wage differentials using only those \nindustries employing workers with similar skill levels. Specifically, I calculate the coefficient of \nvariation for wage rates across the 15 manufacturing industries characterized by Wood (1994) as \nbeing average or low skill industries. Doing so maximizes my sample size and minimizes sample \n \n \nStrategic targeting 16 \n \nselection bias. It also reduces the heterogeneity of workers\u2019 skills thereby minimizing the effect \nof skill variation on inter-industry wage differentials. Eliminating high-skill industries may have \nthe unintended consequence of excluding those workers facing the highest adjustment costs (if \nskills are positively correlated with adjustment costs). Excluding high-skill industries likely \nmakes it more difficult to find evidence in support of my argument because those workers with \nthe greatest interest in narrow transfers are missing from the sample.xii \nEmpirical model \n Two sets of models are estimated using different dependent variables. The first, \nComplaints, measures the total number of complaints filed with the GATT\/WTO against a \ncountry alleging the provision of a narrow transfer in a given year. The second, CVDs, measures \nthe total number of countervailing duties imposed against a given country in a given year. Given \nthe discrete non-negative properties of both variables, it is appropriate to use an event count \nprocedure to model the process. Here, I use the negative binominal model because both count \nvariables are overdispersed.xiii The negative binomial model allows for overdispersion and \nincludes parameters for unobserved variance in the number of disputes across countries (King, \n1989; Long, 1997).  \nOne might argue that the zero inflated negative binomial model is more appropriate for \nthis analysis given the excessive number of zeroes in both count variables.xiv However, the large \nnumber of zeros may be the result of unobserved heterogeneity (Cameron and Trivedi, 1998; \nLong, 1997). Unobserved heterogeneity can cause both overdispersion and an increase in the \nproportion of zeros. The negative binominal model can account for the ovedispersion and the \nexcess zeros in the raw data. The negative binominal model responds to the under prediction of \nzeros in the Poisson regression model by increasing the conditional variance without changing \n \n \nStrategic targeting 17 \n \nthe conditional mean (Long, 1997). In contrast, zero modified count models change the mean \nstructure to explicitly model the production of zero counts. This is done by assuming that zeros \ncan be generated by a different process than positive counts. However, the theory advanced here \ndoes not suggest that the zeros are generated by a different process. Given this, it is difficult to \njustify theoretically the use of the zero inflated negative binomial model. I do, however, test to \nsee if estimating a zero-inflated negative binominal model would produce dramatically different \nresults.xv No significant bias appears to be introduced by estimating the more theoretically sound \nnegative binominal model rather than the zero-inflated model. \nThe base sample is an unbalanced panel with yearly observations from 1980 to 2003. \nThese data are used in a pooled time-series cross-section analysis with country-years as \nobservations. Countries are included only during those years in which they are GATT\/WTO \nmembers and only high-functioning democracies are included in the sample.xvi This allows for \ncorrect estimates of the effect of electoral rules and minimizes the cross-national variance in the \ncosts of non-compliance with GATT\/WTO restrictions on narrowly targeted transfers \n(Mansfield, Milner and Rosendorff, 2002). All reported models are estimated using robust \nstandard errors clustered by country. These standard errors adjust for the fact that observations \nfor each country are unlikely to be independent. The failure to account for clustering may \nunderstate the standard errors on the estimated coefficients for the country-level variables \n(Moulton, 1990). All models include a lagged dependent variable to take account of serial \ncorrelation.xvii  \nThe base model includes several important control variables.xviii Previous research \nsuggests that some complaints are filed in retaliation for previous complaints (Busch and \nReinhardt, 2002). To account for this, a dichotomous variable labeled Plaintiff indicates those \n \n \nStrategic targeting 18 \n \ncountry-years in which a complaint or CVD was filed by the country. The WTO regime differs \nfrom the GATT regime in several important ways. Therefore, an indicator variable, WTO (coded \none for years during the WTO regime and zero otherwise) is included in all estimated models.  \nCountries with majoritarian electoral rules tend to have relatively larger economies. It \nmay be possible to find a spurious positive correlation between majoritarian electoral rules and \nillegal narrow transfers if large countries are less concerned with the international costs of non-\ncompliance. In order to correctly estimate the effect of majoritarian electoral rules on targeted \ntransfers and minimize the cross-national variance in the costs of non-compliance, the log of \nGDP is included to control for a country\u2019s size.  \nSeveral additional economic variables are also included.xix Exports, calculated as the \namount of goods and services exported as a percent of GDP (logged), is included because \ninternational scrutiny of a country\u2019s domestic transfers increases as a country\u2019s exports increase. \nGDP per capita is included because developed countries have historically used the GATT\/WTO \ndispute settlement procedures more often than less-developed countries. Also, the costs of non-\ncompliance may vary systematically with economic development making it important to control \nfor development.  \nThe yearly rate of economic growth (Growth) is included because slower economic \ngrowth may spur demands for narrow transfers in an attempt to insulate the rates of return in a \nparticular industry from market pressures. Economic growth may also capture indirectly the \neffect of various economic shocks. To test for this, I include separately two different measures of \nexternal shocks to traded sectors of the economy: import growth and terms of trade. One might \nexpect greater demand for narrow transfers in countries facing increased import competition or \ndeteriorating terms of trade.xx Additionally, violating international restrictions during times of \n \n \nStrategic targeting 19 \n \nadverse economic conditions may not entail the same reputation costs as doing so under normal \neconomic conditions (Drazen, 1997).  \nAlthough these control variables are not unrelated, standard tests show acceptable levels \nof multicolinearity.xxi Their inclusion in a single model does not introduce undue bias. The \nresults are reported in Table 1 and described below. \n[Table 1 about here] \nResults \nAdjustment costs, measured by inter-industry wage differentials, are positively associated \nwith narrow transfers, as expected. Increased adjustment costs increase the expected number of \nnarrow transfers in both majoritarian and PR systems. However, the increase is relatively larger \nin PR systems as demonstrated in Table 2, which reports the percentage increase in the expected \nnumber of narrow transfers.xxii As adjustment costs increase from the 10th percentile to the 25th \npercentile, the expected number of Complaints increases by 17 percent in majoritarian countries \nin a given year and 100 percent in PR countries. Although politicians in both systems are \nresponsive to increased demand for narrow transfers (spurred by higher adjustment costs), \npoliticians in PR systems are relatively more responsive. The difference in responsiveness across \nthe two systems is even greater at higher levels of labor specificity. As adjustment costs increase \nfrom the 75th to the 90th percentile, the expected number of Complaints increases by 60 percent \nin majoritarian systems in a given year; the increase is greater than 900 percent in PR systems. \nAlthough politicians elected via majoritarian rules are not deaf to increased voter demand for \nnarrow transfers, politicians in PR systems appear to be far more responsive, all else equal.   \n[Table 2 about here] \n \n \n \nStrategic targeting 20 \n \nGiven this, it may be possible that under certain circumstances PR systems will provide \nmore narrow transfers than majoritarian systems. When voter demand for narrow transfers is \nvery high, for example, one might expect to see more narrow transfers in PR countries. I find \nsome evidence of this in Table 3, which reports the expected number of narrow transfers in PR \nand majoritarian countries across various levels of labor specificity.xxiii When adjustment costs \nare quite high (90th percentile), there are more narrow transfers in PR countries than majoritarian \ncountries, all else equal.xxiv This is arguably because politicians in PR systems are more \nresponsive to surges in voter demand for narrow transfers and better able to supply narrow \ntransfers than politicians in majoritarian systems.  \n[Table 3 about here] \nIn general, however, majoritarian systems tend to be more prone to narrow transfers than \nPR systems. Moving from a PR system to a majoritarian system increases the expected number \nof narrow transfers (Complaints) by 288 percent in a given year, holding all else constant.xxv  \nWhen adjustment costs fall below the 90th percentile, the expected number of narrow transfers is \ngreater in majoritarian systems. This finding is consistent with arguments by Persson and \nTabellini (1999, 2000, 2003), Lizzeri and Persico (2001) and others and points to the potential \nindependent effect of electoral rules on transfer form. The incentives to provide narrow transfers \nappear to exist in majoritarian countries even when there is little voter demand for such transfers. \nFor example, when adjustment costs fall in the 10th percentile, majoritarian systems continue to \nprovide more narrow transfers than PR systems. This is arguably because the voters critical to a \npolitician\u2019s (and a party\u2019s) electoral success in majoritarian systems are concentrated in select, \ngeographically-defined electoral districts. Electorally minded politicians competing for office in \n \n \nStrategic targeting 21 \n \nthese systems have incentives to provide narrow transfers to these voters in the hope that they \nwill reward them with their electoral support.  \nAlthough electoral rules play an important role in shaping the form of distributive \ntransfers, they are only one determinant. Voters\u2019 demands also matter. Greater voter demand for \nnarrowly targeted transfers increases the number of narrow transfers in any given country. \nHowever, the increase is relatively larger in PR countries. Although majoritarian systems are \ngenerally more prone to narrow transfers, PR systems are more responsive to surges in demand \nfor narrow transfers. This finding is remarkably robust; introducing other possible variables of \ninterest such as the relative strength of industry unions or external shocks does not change the \nkey findings.xxvi Furthermore, I find similar results using an alternative measure of voter demand \nfor narrow transfers, namely the rate of labor movement.xxvii These results are also strikingly \nsimilar across the two measures of narrow transfers, although only statistically significant at \nconventional levels when narrow transfers are measured using Complaints. The similarities \nbetween the models estimated using Complaints and CVDs are rather surprising given the large \nsubstantive differences between the processes and politics surrounding countervailing duties and \nGATT\/WTO complaints. Future research using new measures of narrowly targeted transfers is \nneeded to confirm the generalizability of these results. Given the difficultly of measuring \nnarrowly targeted transfers in a cross-nationally comparable manner, these findings represent an \nimportant first step to understanding the interactive effect of electoral institutions and domestic \ninterests on the form of distributive transfers.  \nConclusion \nVirtually every government provides distributive transfers for electoral purposes. \nHowever, the level and form of such transfers vary dramatically across countries. In some \n \n \nStrategic targeting 22 \n \ncountries, distributive transfers tend to target benefits to broadly defined groups of voters. In \nothers, the benefits of distributive transfers often go exclusively to narrow select groups. What \nexplains the cross-national variation in transfer form? The answer proposed here points to the \nimportance of domestic politics. Together, electoral institutions and domestic economic interests \nshape the form of distributive transfers and explain, in part, the variation in transfer form across \ncountries.  \nPoliticians seeking to maximize their (re)election chances work to provide the type of \ntransfer with the greatest electoral benefits. The electoral benefits of different types of transfers \nare determined in part by the country\u2019s electoral rules. Narrow transfers provide relatively \ngreater benefits to politicians in majoritarian systems because of the nature of electoral \ncompetition in these systems. However, electorally minded politicians in both systems respond to \nvoters\u2019 preferences over transfer form. Voters\u2019 preferences over the form of distributive transfers \nare determined by the costs of moving their primary income earning asset (most often labor) \nbetween uses in the domestic economy. As the costs of adjustment increase, voter demand for \nnarrow transfers grows. As demand grows, the number of narrow transfers increases in both PR \nand majoritarian systems. However, the rate of increase is relatively greater in PR systems \nsuggesting that politicians elected via proportional rules are relatively more responsive to voter \ndemand.  \nThis finding suggests a possible resolution to the debate over which electoral system is \nmost prone to narrow transfers and may help to explain previous mixed results. Although \nPersson and Tabellini (2003) find that PR systems spend relatively more on broad transfers, \nRogowski and Kayser (2002), and Rogowski, Chang, and Kayser (2003) find evidence to suggest \nthat PR systems provide relatively more narrow transfers. The argument made here suggests that \n \n \nStrategic targeting 23 \n \nboth outcomes are possible depending on voters\u2019 preferences over transfer form. In general, \nmajoritarian systems tend to provided more narrow transfers than PR systems. However, PR \nsystems are more responsive to surges in voter demand for narrow transfers. When voter demand \nfor narrow transfers is high, PR systems may provide more narrow transfers than majoritarian \nsystems because they are relatively more responsive to voter demand and better able to supply \nnarrow transfers.  \nIn Rogowski\u2019s studies, the countries in question are all economically developed. In fact, \nRogowski\u2019s analyses include only OECD countries while Persson and Tabellini examine as \nmany as 80 countries with various levels of economic development. The difference in samples \nhas important implications for voter\u2019s preferences over transfer form. In developed economies, \nthe adjustment costs facing workers tend to be quite high (Hiscox, 2002). As a result, voter \ndemand for narrow transfers is likely high in Rogowski\u2019s sample of countries. When voter \ndemand for narrow transfers is high, we might reasonably expect to see more narrow transfers in \nPR countries because of the closer correspondence between the interests of the voters and the \nlegislators in PR systems and because politicians in PR systems may be better able to supply \nnarrow transfers in response to voter demand. In short, Rogowski et al.\u2019s findings are fully \nconsistent with the argument made here \u2013 an argument which may help to resolve the debate \nover which electoral system is most prone to narrow transfers and further our understanding of \nthe politics of (re)distribution.  \n \n \nStrategic targeting 24 \n \nReferences \n \nAlesina, A., Glaeser E., & Sacerdote, B.

I \nsystematically identify and exclude those complaints that were not filed in response to alleged \nillegal narrow transfers including: (1) complaints over broad transfers and\/or policies that affect \na wide range of goods, producers, or industries. So for example, the 1982 dispute between the \nUnited States and the European Community over the value added tax (VAT) threshold is \nexcluded; (2) complaints related to the enforcement of intellectual property rights; (3) complaints \nfiled against the European Community\/European Union unless it is quite clear which EC\/EU \nmember country the complaint is primarily in response to; (4) complaints related to anti-dumping \nmeasures. Anti-dumping measures are imposed by governments in response to a foreign firm\u2019s \npolicy rather than a foreign government\u2019s policy; (5) complaints that are explicitly political in \nnature. So, for example, the 1985 complaint filed by Nicaragua against the US in response to the \ntrade embargo imposed by the Reagan Administration is excluded; (6) complaints related to non-\nmanufacturing transfers in order to ensure consistency with the countervailing duties measure \nand the measure of inter-industry wage differentials. Complaints over countervailing duties are \nincluded only after carefully examining the GATT\/WTO Panel Reports to correctly identify the \ncountry initially accused of having the illegal narrow transfer. Complaints filed by multiple \ncountries over a single illegal narrow transfer are counted against the defendant country only \nonce. A research assistant independently coded the universe of GATT\/WTO complaints using \nthe same criteria. The percentage agreement between the two coders was 99%. \n \n \n \nStrategic targeting 37 \n \n \nNotes \n                                                 \ni Focusing on the adjustment costs facing labor has several other advantages. First, labor is \nrelatively immobile across national borders (Rodrik, 2000). This allows us to ignore the \npossibility that the preferences of internationally immobile workers differ from those of \ninternationally mobile workers (Hiscox, 2004). Second, the adjustment costs facing labor have \nreceived significant scholarly attention and consensus exists as to how to estimate these costs.    \nii It is important to note that this argument is different from, but wholly consistent with, Estevez-\nAbe, Iversen, and Soskice (2001) who argue that broad transfers induce workers to invest in \nspecific skills. Once workers have these specific skills they then demand narrow transfers.  \niii Institutional complementarities may reinforce cross-national variation in adjustment costs. In \ncountries with high adjustment costs, institutions develop that make use of the industry-specific \nskills available in the labor market (Hall and Soskice, 2001). \niv Unions may help to increase the probability that the demands of certain groups of voters are \ntranslated into policy outcomes. With respect to transfer form, the role of unions would likely \ndepend on the characteristics of unions\u2019 members. Industry unions are more likely to push for \nnarrow transfers than nationally centralized unions representing workers from different \nindustries. Unfortunately, due to data limitations it is not possible to test this expectation for the \nentire sample of countries under investigation here.  \nv Some argue that aggregate government spending is higher with multi-party coalition \ngovernment because of this dynamic (e.g. Bawn and Rosenbluth, 2006; Persson, Roland and \nTabellini, 2003). Given this, it may be the case that PR systems spend more than majoritarian \nsystems on both narrow and broad transfers.  \n \n \nStrategic targeting 38 \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nvi Additional attempts to measure narrow transfers include civilian spending (Swank, 1988) and \noverall government expenditures as a percentage of GDP (Bawn and Rosenbluth, 2006). Neither \nmeasure closely approximates the concept of interest here. \nvii They may do so because of the domestic electoral benefits.  \nviii Data are from the Allee (2005); Hudec (1993); Reinhardt (1996); and the WTO (2005).  \nix I also employ a second measure of adjustment costs as a robustness test. This measure, \nestimates the rate of labor movement across manufacturing industries and into and out of the \nmanufacturing sector (Seddon and Wacziarg, 2001). Using this alternative measure, I find \nstrikingly similar results. Higher adjustment costs increase the number of narrow transfers in any \ngiven country; the increase is relatively larger in PR countries. These results are available from \nthe author upon request. \nx See Oostendorp (2005) for more details. \nxi This is a simple application of the \u201claw of one price.\u201d \nxii To test for this possibility, I re-estimate all models using a measure of inter-industry wage \ndifferentials calculated for all manufacturing industries, regardless of skill-type. I find similar \nresults to those found using only average\/low skill industries. These are available upon request.  \nxiii The mean of CVD is equal to 0.12; the standard deviation is 0.42. The mean value of \nComplaints is 0.17; the standard deviation is 0.55. Although the unconditional variance is greater \nthan the unconditional mean for both count variables, the dispersion parameter, alpha, is equal to \nzero in several of the estimated models. When alpha is equal to zero, the negative binominal \ndistribution is equivalent to a Poisson distribution.  \nxiv 88 percent of the sample country-years have no Complaints and 91 percent have no CVDs. \nxv I use a country\u2019s exports to predict zero counts.  \n \n \nStrategic targeting 39 \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nxvi Only countries with a Polity score greater than 5 are included in the sample. Data are from \nMarshall and Jaggers (2003).  \nxvii Although including the lagged dependent variable is arguably \u2018most correct\u2019, I re-estimated \nall models without the lagged dependent variable to see what, if any, temporal dynamics may \nhave been obscured by the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable. The coefficients on the \nkey variables of interest are virtually unchanged. This is likely because most of the variation in \nthe key variables of interest (Majoritarian and Adjustment Costs) is cross-sectional. For example, \nno country in my sample changes their electoral rules during the period under study. \nxviii All control variables are lagged one year to take into account the delay between the \nimplementation of an illegal narrow transfer and the international reaction. I experimented with \ndifferent lag structures and did not find any significant difference for the key variables of interest \n(Majoritarian and Adjustment Costs), arguably because these variables tend to be relatively time \ninvariant making the specific lag structure less important.   \nxix Data on all economic variables come from the World Development Indicators (2005).  \nxx Neither measure is a robust predictor of narrow transfers. For this reason and space \nconstraints, models that include Import Growth and Terms of Trade are not reported here but are \navailable from the author upon request. Importantly, the estimated coefficient on the key \nvariables of interest did not change significantly when these measures were included.  \nxxi The variance inflation factor (VIF) is less than 4 for all variables included in the models, as \nrecommended by Huber et al. (1993). \nxxii Estimated via CLARIFY using Models 3 and 3.1 from Table 1 (King, Tomz and Wittenberg, \n2000; Tomz, Wittenberg and King, 2001). All control variables are held constant at their median \n \n \nStrategic targeting 40 \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nvalues. The interaction term along with both constitutive terms (L.Majoritarian and L.Adjustment \ncosts) were modified for each simulation.  \nxxiii In every case, the expected number of narrow transfers is quite small. This is because the \nmodal number of transfers in any given country-year is zero. However, this does not mean that \nthe substantive effect of voter preferences and electoral institutions is small. It simply \ndemonstrates that the likelihood of seeing a Complaint or CVD in any given year in any given \ncountry is relatively low. \nxxiv This difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels.  \nxxv This effect is estimated via Clarify using Model 2 from Table 1. All other variables are held \nconstant at their median value. This effect is statistically significant at the 0.1 level in a two-\ntailed test.  \nxxvi Although these results are not reported here, they are available from the author upon request. \nThe relative strength of industry unions is measured for developed countries using data from \nGolden, Lange, and Wallerstein (2006). Specifically, I calculate the ratio of unaffiliated union \nmembership to confederal union membership. I measure external shocks using the percentage \nchange in imports and the net barter terms of trade (WDI, 2007). These variables are not \nstatistically significant at conventional levels.  \nxxvii Specifically, I use Wacziarg and Wallack (2004)\u2019s EM2 measure that calculates the overall \nmanufacturing employment loss or gain as the percentage change in total manufacturing \nemployment for the past two years. Higher rates of labor movement are taken as indicators of \nlower adjustment costs. These results are available from the author upon request.  \n \n \n"}
