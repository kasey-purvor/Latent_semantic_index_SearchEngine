Ionosphere (Active experiments; Plasma waves\nand instabilities; Instruments and techniques)\n1 Introduction\nHigh-power ground-based HF radio transmitters (heaters)\nhave played an important role, over the past few decades, in\nthe investigation of nonlinear wave interactions in space plas-\nmas. From the earliest experiments at Platteville, Colorado\n(Minkoff et al., 1974) and at Arecibo, Puerto Rico (Gor-\ndon and Carlson, 1974) it became clear that large amplitude\nCorrespondence to: T. R. Robinson\n(txr@ion.le.ac.uk)\nelectromagnetic waves from heaters could excite a variety of\nplasma instabilities which caused the amplification of small-\nscale electrostatic plasma modes in the ionosphere that were\nthen detectable as enhanced radar backscatter. Two broadly\ndistinguishable types of artificially enhanced scatter are ob-\nserved during the interaction of an ordinary mode (O-mode)\nheater wave with the ionosphere. The first involves scatter\nfrom small-scale field-aligned plasma density irregularities\n(striations) which requires the diagnostic radar beam to be di-\nrected orthogonal to the geomagnetic field. The striations are\nthought to be generated by a thermal parametric instability\nat the upper-hybrid resonance (UHR) height, although they\nextend for several tens of kilometres along the geomagnetic\nfield (Robinson, 1989). The heater-induced scatter is very\naspect-sensitive (Minkoff et al., 1974) and usually very much\nstronger than similarly aspect-sensitive scatter of natural ori-\ngin (Dhillon et al., 2002). It is easily detected by conven-\ntional coherent backscatter radars. Many such observations\nof striations artificially stimulated by the EISCAT heater at\nTroms\u00f8 by the CUTLASS (Co-operative UK Twin Located\nAuroral Sounding System) radars have been reported (Robin-\nson et al., 1997; Bond et al., 1997; Yeoman et al., 1997).\nThe second type of artificial scatter involves low frequency\nwaves (either ion-acoustic or alternatively purely-growing\nmode) and high-frequency electron-acoustic waves which are\nthought to be driven unstable by the ponderomotive force\n(Fejer, 1979). These waves are excited near the reflection\nheight of the O-mode heater wave. The scatter from these\nwaves is less aspect sensitive than that from field-aligned\nstriations and is typically observed by incoherent scatter\nradars with steerable beams, over a range of beam directions\nfrom that parallel to the geomagnetic field direction up to\na few tens degrees away from it. Although, during heat-\ning experiments, the amplitudes of these waves are consid-\nerably enhanced above naturally occurring levels, the result-\ning backscatter is generally weaker than that of the aspect-\nsensitive scatter from field-aligned striations. Non aspect-\nsensitive artificial scatter has been extensively studied us-\ning both the UHF and VHF incoherent backscatter radars at\n292 T. R. Robinson et al.: SPEAR-induced artificial backscatter from CUTLASS and EISCAT Svalbard radars\nTroms\u00f8 in conjunction with the EISCAT heater (Isham et al.,\n1990; Kohl et al., 1993; Rietveld et al., 2000).\nIt is known that there is a strong relationship between\nthe evolution of the aspect-sensitive and non aspect-sensitive\nbackscatter described above. In particular, the so-called\n\u201covershoot\u201d phenomenon (Robinson, 1989) regularly seen\nin non aspect-sensitive scatter is thought to be due to the\nanomalous absorption (Robinson, 2002) of heater wave\npower at the UHR due to the relatively slow development\nof striations there. This quenches the more rapidly devel-\noping non aspect-sensitive scatter at the heater reflection\nheight, which is typically a few kilometres above the UHR.\nFurthermore, Dhillon and Robinson (2005) have found ev-\nidence that the striations may act as waveguides for the\nsmaller wavelength plasma waves involved in non aspect-\nsensitive backscattering and thus affect their propagation and\nbackscattering properties.\nIn spite of this physical link, there have been rather few\npublished examples simultaneous observations of the two\ntypes of scatter, in comparison to the wealth of observa-\ntions of one type or the other. Until recently, the only site\nwhere these two types of observation could be carried out\nroutinely has been at Troms\u00f8, where both coherent and in-\ncoherent scatter access to the heated volume is available.\nHowever, in April 2004 a new high-power HF facility be-\ngan operations on the island of Spitzbergen in the Svalbard\narchipelago. This new SPEAR (Space Plasma Exploration\nby Active Radar) facility, designed and built by the Univer-\nsity of Leicester, in the UK, is intended to serve a number of\nscientific purposes. Its main role will be to carry out active\nspace plasma experiments in the polar ionosphere and mag-\nnetosphere by exciting striations that can be used as targets\nfor coherent scatter radar observation of otherwise unobserv-\nable dynamical processes (Yeoman et al., 1997), by stimulat-\ning Alfve\u00b4n wave resonances in the magnetosphere (Robinson\net al., 2000; Wright et al., 2000) and, in addition, it will also\nbe able to function as a radar, by itself receiving backscatter\nfrom the ionosphere (low-power mode), in a manner similar\nto the CUTLASS radars, and possibly also from the magne-\ntosphere (high-power mode).\nThe experiments reported below were mainly designed to\ntest the capabilities of the SPEAR high-power HF beam and\nin particular to study the excitation of field-aligned striations.\nThe SPEAR site is both geographically further north than\nthat of the Troms\u00f8 heater and also has a higher dip angle.\nIt is known that the three important directions in the geom-\netry of heating experiments are determined by the normal\nto the ionospheric layers (which is close to the local verti-\ncal direction), the dip angle and the heater beam direction.\nThe SPEAR geometry differs in several respects from that at\nTroms\u00f8. For example, the SPEAR beam half-power half-\nwidth of around 10.5\u25e6 in the magnetic meridian is larger\nthan the local dip angle (around 8.5\u25e6) and for both vertical\npointing and field-aligned pointing the beam will contain the\nspitze angle, whereas at Troms\u00f8 the beam is narrower and\nthe dip angle is 12\u25e6. Rietveld et al. (2003) have demonstrated\nthat this geometry has a significant influence on the response\nof the ionosphere to HF heating. Moreover, the EISCAT\nSvalbard radar operates at a frequency of 500 MHz, which is\nintermediate between the 224 MHz VHF and 930 MHz UHF\nEISCAT radars at Troms\u00f8. It is known that Landau damp-\ning, which is highly wavelength dependent, plays an impor-\ntant role in determining the spectral content of non aspect-\nsensitive scatter during heating. Furthermore, SPEAR is lo-\ncated in the polar cap, while Troms\u00f8 is regarded as usually\nbeing within the auroral zone. The state of the ionosphere in\nthe polar cap is much less well-known and generally differ-\nent from that further south, over Troms\u00f8. It is thus important\nto compare and contrast the results of heating with SPEAR\nand with the Troms\u00f8 facility, not only for practical opera-\ntional considerations, but also to shed new light on heating\nphenomena, which are still not well understood and which\nare amenable to study through varying the geometry of the\nheating experiment.\nThe present paper is intended to serve several purposes.\nFirst to provide a description of the new SPEAR facility, then\nto report the results of new experiments which demonstrate\nSPEAR\u2019s capabilities in generating enhanced backscatter\nphenomena and also to discuss these results, albeit briefly,\nin the light of what has been previously observed, partic-\nularly at the Troms\u00f8 heating facility. The paper is set out\nas follows. The new SPEAR facility is described in Sect. 2\nand the arrangement of the experiment in relation to the di-\nagnostics involved, i.e. the CUTLASS and ESR radars, is\ndescribed in Sect. 3. The results of the first SPEAR obser-\nvations of enhanced ESR backscatter and enhanced CUT-\nLASS backscatter from two campaigns run in April\/May and\nSeptember\/October, 2004 are reported in Sect. 4. The new\nresults are discussed in Sect. 5.\n2 The SPEAR system\nSPEAR (Space Plasma Exploration by Active Radar) is a\nnew high-power radar system located at Lat. 78.15\u25e6 N, Long.\n16.05\u25e6 E, in the vicinity of Longyearbyen (Spitzbergen) and\nis designed to carry out a range of space plasma investi-\ngations of the polar ionosphere and magnetosphere. The\nSPEAR site is located adjacent to the EISCAT Svalbard\nRadar (ESR) at an altitude of 420 m above sea-level, on a\nplateau on Mine 7 mountain some 10 km from Longyearbyen\n(see Fig. 1).\nThe SPEAR antenna system (Fig. 2). comprises a 6\u00d74\narray of full-wave, crossed-dipoles, 16 m above the ground,\nwith an antenna spacing of 48.4 m, allowing the transmission\nof both linear and circularly polarised signals. The individ-\nual dipoles are rhombically broadened to allow operation be-\ntween 4 and 6 MHz. The site is large enough to accommodate\na planned extension of the system up to a 6\u00d76 array.\nThe resulting beam has a quasi-elliptical cross-section,\nwith an average half-power width of 21\u25e6 along its major axis\n(parallel to the array north direction, shown in Fig. 2) and 14\u25e6\nalong its minor axis. This results in an overall antenna gain\nof 21 dB. Individual phase-control provides beam-steering\nT. R.

A view of part of the SPEAR antenna array on mine 7 moun-\ntain, with the ESR dishes in the background.\nwithin \u00b130\u25e6 from zenith, at any azimuth, without signif-\nicantly altering the antenna gain or introducing significant\nside-lobe signals. The beam may thus be pointed in direc-\ntions which include vertical and field-aligned. Beam-steering\nto angles further from the zenith may be achieved but in\nthis case significant side-lobes are introduced into the field-\npattern. A block diagram of the whole system, which inter-\nfaces to the antennas, is illustrated in Fig. 3.\nSPEAR is a distributed transmitting and receiving system\nconsisting of individual 4-kW solid-state transmitters con-\nnected to the antenna array. Each transmitter consists of a\nsingle driver-stage and 4 individual 1-kW modules, the out-\nputs of which are combined and fed to the antenna. In the\n4\u00d76 configuration 48 such transmitters are required. These\nare made up of 192 power-amplifier modules, 48 driver-\nstages and a total of 240 power-supply units. Each transmit-\nter contains an embedded controller and an individual Direct\nDigital Synthesiser (DDS) which provides a transmit signal\nand the IF for the receiver front-end. Eight transmitters are\nhoused in a half-sized shipping container which feeds a 2\u00d72\nsub-array. The entire SPEAR system is housed in 6 such\ncontainers. All of the transmitters were built in the Radio and\nSpace Plasma group\u2019s workshops in Leicester, by the group\u2019s\ntechnical staff.\nThe control system is housed in a further shipping con-\ntainer located on the edge of the antenna array and feeds\ncommon clock signals and network signals to the transmit\ncontainers via optical connections. Receiver IF signals are\nsummed in the transmitter containers and passed via copper\ncables to the control cabin where they are summed and fed to\na single-channel receiver, the data from which is processed\nby the receiver data-logger. Control of the entire system\nis achieved by passing instructions to the distributed-system\ncontrollers within the transmitter containers. The control sig-\nnal also implements safety features which prevent transmis-\nsion in the presence of aircraft.\nFig 2\nFig. 2. Schematic of the SPEAR antenna array with transmitter\ncontainers and dipoles. The (blue) shaded area shows the planned\nextension. The orientation of the array is indicated by the arrows.\nThe transmitter containers pose a serious design constraint\nin that they must be both insulated and heated to allow oper-\nation with low external temperatures that are frequently be-\nlow\u221230\u25e6C, but that must also be capable of dissipating some\n30 kW of waste heat during full-power CW operation. This\nproblem is compounded by the need to prevent the ingress\nof snow which places serious constraints on forced air cool-\ning systems. Closed circuit cooling (air conditioning) is not\nappropriate due to cost considerations, high maintenance re-\nquirements and reliability concerns. Each transmitter con-\ntainer includes several heaters and cooling fans connected by\nH-section ducting which are controlled by a container en-\nvironmental controller which monitors internal and external\ntemperatures to provide autonomous control of the heating\nand cooling. With the additional DDS control computer that\nis necessary to program the 8 DDS modules in each transmit-\nter container, each transmitter container consists of a 10-node\ncomputer system.\nThe first 5 transmitter containers were completed during\nthe autumn of 2002 and shipped along with the 4 control con-\ntainers to Longyearbyen. These containers were transported\nto the SPEAR site and moved into position during the spring\nof 2003. At the same time the antenna system was shipped\ndirectly from the manufacturers to the site. The final trans-\nmitter container was retained at Leicester to permit software\ndevelopment and completion and testing of the phasing sys-\ntem. This delay meant that the antenna array was incomplete\nfor the first operational tests in April\/May 2004, although\nsome successful scientific results were obtained (see Sect. 4\nbelow). The 6\u00d74 array was complete in time for the second\ncampaign in September\/October 2004.\n3 Experimental arrangements\nThe primary aim of the first year of operations of SPEAR was\nto establish the capability of the high-power beam to gener-\nate artificial striations, in line with SPEAR\u2019s central scientific\nraison d\u2019etre. The SPEAR site is within the fields of view of\nboth the CUTLASS radars in Finland (Hankasalmi) and Ice-\nland (Thykkvib\u00e6r), (Fig. 4), which were operated throughout\n294 T. R.

The ESR UHF radar was also oper-\nated, initially as a secondary diagnostic to provide informa-\ntion about the local background ionosphere. As it turned out,\nit was the ESR which provided the first evidence of SPEAR-\ninduced nonlinear effects in the ionosphere. A co-located\nionosonde was also available to provide real time informa-\ntion about the maximum ionospheric plasma frequency. This\nenabled the experimenters to choose appropriate SPEAR op-\nerating frequencies.\nDuring the April\/May campaign only 35 transmitters were\ninitially available due to the incompleteness of the system,\nas indicated above. These were operated at a mean power\nof 3 kW and thus provided a total of 105 kW with an esti-\nmated antenna gain of 20 dB. The effective radiated power\nin this case was just over 10 MW. However, quite soon af-\nter the beginning of the first campaign technical difficulties\nwere encountered which resulted in the loss of transmitters.\nFor the second campaign, the complete 6\u00d74 array was avail-\nable, i.e. 48 transmitters, which produced an antenna gain of\n21 dB. However, in view of the transmitter problems from\nthe first campaign, it was decided to run at 2 kW per trans-\nmitter in the second campaign, which meant an ERP of just\nover 15 MW. With the experience gained from the first few\ncampaigns, the transmitters will ultimately each be able to\nachieve 4 kW, which will result in an ERP of 30 MW.\n3.1 CUTLASS operations\nThe current stereo CUTLASS radar is an HF coherent\nbackscatter radar system located at Hankasalmi, Finland and\nThykkvib\u00e6r, Iceland (Lester et al., 2004), capable of near\nsimultaneous operation on two separate frequencies. The\nradars form part of the SuperDARN array (Greenwald et\nal., 1995). CUTLASS is ideally situated for making obser-\nvations of the SPEAR-modified ionosphere over the ESR,\nsince the SPEAR site is located well within the fields of\nview of both the CUTLASS Finland (Fig. 5a) and CUT-\nLASS Iceland (Fig. 5b) radars. Both radars reach the iono-\nsphere above SPEAR via a 1.5-hop HF propagation path, as\nshown schematically in Fig. 5c. Normal operations for both\nradars involve a 16-beam scan over ranges 180\u20133555 km,\nT. R.

In the experiments presented here\nthe CUTLASS radars ran in a high temporal and spatial reso-\nlution mode, with both radars running a reduced scan of 3\u20135\nbeams centred over SPEAR (beams 6 and 9 for Thykkvib\u00e6r\nand Hankasalmi respectively), with an integration time of 1 s.\nChannel-A of each of the radars provides high spatial resolu-\ntion, with a field-of-view restricted to 75 range-gates of size\n15 km covering ranges of 1485\u20132610 km, while Channel-B\nprovides data over the complete propagation path from the\nHF radars to SPEAR at a resolution of 45 km, over distances\nof 180\u20133555 km. Both Channels-A and -B of each radar ad-\nditionally perform a small frequency sweep, with the scans\ncycling through approximately three HF frequencies which\nare appropriate to allow propagation to Svalbard over a 1.5-\nhop path. Frequencies of 11\u201313 MHz were chosen for the\nexperiments presented here. Thus the combination of the\nintegration-time, scan-pattern and frequency-sweep provided\na time-resolution of between 9 and 15 s in this arrangement.\n3.2 ESR operations\nThe first ESR\/SPEAR observations were carried out using\nthe 32 m (steerable) and 42 m (fixed) dishes of the EISCAT\nSvalbard Radar. These were co-aligned in the magnetic field\ndirection (azimuth 181\u25e6, elevation 81.6\u25e6), and used to record\nion-line and plasma-line data respectively. The ESR experi-\nment used in these observations employed the steffe modu-\nlation scheme, which uses two 16-bit alternating codes. One\nof these codes has a baud-length of 32\u00b5s (total pulse-length\n512\u00b5s), while the other has a baud-length of 96\u00b5s (total\npulse length 1536\u00b5s). The former code is sampled with a\nfractionality of 2, and the latter code is sampled with a frac-\ntionality of 6. This means that both codes are sampled at\nintervals of 16\u00b5s, so that each can give a range resolution\nof 2.4 km, though the data from adjacent height gates are not\nindependent at this range resolution.\nThe alternating code with 16\u00b5s baud-length yields fully\ndecoded data between ranges of 105 and 216 km, while the\ncode with 96\u00b5s baud gives fully decoded data between 259\nand 924 km. In the interval from 216 to 259 km, spectra are\nderived from the alternating code with 96\u00b5s baud, which,\nwhile not fully decoded, nonetheless provides acceptable\ndata for most monitoring purposes. The ion-line spectra pre-\nsented in this paper are shown at range resolutions of 4.8 km\nfor the 16\u00b5s baud code, and 14.4 km for the 96\u00b5s baud\ncode. At this range-resolution, each fully-decoded spectrum\nis independent of its neighbours. The frequency-resolutions\nfor the ion-line spectra from the two alternating codes are\n0.992 kHz and 0.880 kHz.\nThe plasma-line data were recorded using a separate re-\nceiver chain to that used in processing the ion-line signal.\nPlasma-line detection is done using the power returned dur-\ning a brief interval of reception from the longer of the two\n296 T.

During this period SPEAR was transmit-\nting X-mode from 12:00\u201312:04 UT, O-mode from 12:04\u201312:08 UT\nand was off from 12:08\u201312:12 UT.\nphase-coded pulses as it traverses the ionosphere, without\ndecoding the return to enhance range resolution. As a re-\nsult, the data are not resolved in range, but only in fre-\nquency. The plasma-line data thus constitute two time-series\nof frequency-spectra, in overlapping bands of 3.2 to 4.8 MHz\nand 4.5 to 6.1 MHz (offset from the transmitted frequency),\nsummed over all ranges from 150 to 600 km. Within each\nband, the plasma-line power is divided into 128 frequency-\nbins of width 13 kHz. The plasma-line power in most of these\nbins is generally small, except in regions where the gradi-\nent of the electron density profile becomes shallow (i.e. lit-\ntle change in electron density with increasing height). In\nthis case, plasma-line contributions from a range of alti-\ntudes add together to create enhanced power at that partic-\nular plasma frequency. This method is sometimes referred to\nas the \u201cspectral plasma-line\u201d technique, described more fully\nby Showen (1979).\n4 Experimental results\n4.1 Results from the campaign of April\/May 2004\nThe first attempts to observe SPEAR-induced nonlinear ef-\nfects in the ionosphere above Spitzbergen commenced at\n12:00 UT on 27 April 2004. SPEAR was operated at\n4.9 MHz in the following sequence: 4 min on in X-mode,\n4 min on in O-mode, followed by 4 min off. The ERP dur-\ning on periods in the first 12-min sequence was estimated\nat 10 MW. The SPEAR beam was directed along the geo-\nmagnetic field, as was the ESR radar. An ionogram taken at\n11:55 UT (Fig. 6) indicated a maximum plasma frequency\nof around 5.5 MHz, so the heating was over-dense. The up-\nshifted and downshifted plasma-line intensity spectra data\nfrom the ESR for the period from 12:00\u201312:12 UT, corre-\nsponding to the first 12-min sequence are illustrated in the\ntwo panels in Fig. 7.

ESR ion-line data for 12:00\u201312:12 UT, 27 April 2004. The upper panels correspond to the height range 129\u2013757 km with a resolution\nof 14 km and the lower to 105\u2013210 km with a resolution of 5 km. The first column corresponds to SPEAR X-mode (12:00\u201312:04 UT), the\nsecond to O-mode (12:04\u201312:08 UT) and the third to off (12:08\u201312:12 UT).\nresolution of 13 kHz) from the ESR transmitted frequency\n(500.3 MHz) during the O-mode heating between 12:04\u2013\n12:08 UT. A pair of continuous weakly-enhanced natural\nlines (upshifted and downshifted) with a frequency varying\nbetween about\u00b15.6\u20135.7 MHz is also visible in the ESR data.\nThese correspond to the F-region maxima in the ionospheric\nplasma frequency which are consistent with the ionogram\ndata in Fig. 6. These natural lines are visible due to the limb\neffect caused by the lower density gradients at the peak of\nthe ionospheric plasma density.\nThe corresponding ESR ion-line data are displayed in\nFig. 8. Here the data have been averaged over 4 min, corre-\nsponding to the three 4-min periods in the 12-min sequence\ndescribed above. However in contrast to the plasma-line\ndata, height information is included for the ion-line spectra.\nThe six panels in Fig. 8 are arranged as follows. Each col-\numn includes the two overlapping height ranges described\nin Sect. 3.2. The altitude values along the vertical axes of\nthe plots are the lower edge of the range bins. So whereas\nthe 200-km curve in the upper panel represents the range\n200\u2013214 km, the 200-km curve in the lower panel corre-\nsponds to 200\u2013205 km. Time increases along the rows from\nleft to right. Clearly the X-mode (first column) and the\noff-period (last column) are virtually indistinguishable, in-\ndicating no effect of the SPEAR beam during X-mode heat-\ning. The height variation of the spectral shapes during these\ntwo periods is typical of the transition from single-humped\nspectra from the collisional E-region to double-humped in\nthe F-region. However, equally clear is the strong modifi-\ncation of the ion spectrum for the period of O-mode heat-\ning (middle column), at a height close to 200 km (upper\npanel), which corresponds to the SPEAR-ionosphere interac-\ntion height, close to where the plasma frequency is 4.9 MHz,\nin this instance. The reason why there is no enhancement in\nthe corresponding 200-km curve in the lower panel (middle\ncolumn) is probably due to the interaction layer being very\nnarrow in altitude (Djuth et al., 1994) and, in this instance,\nits lying close to the upper edge of the range bin in the up-\nper panel, i.e. just below 214 km.

Significant\nenhancements in all these features are present throughout\nthe SPEAR O-mode operation (12:04\u201312:08 UT) although\nthe amplitudes vary considerably from dump to dump. The\nplasma-lines are enhanced by a factor of around ten, on av-\nerage, over the natural background levels (seen during the\noff-period from 12:08\u201312:12 UT), but there are peaks of up\nto about a hundred times background. Also, there is a high\ndegree of correlation in all five elements of the spectrum, as\nwell as a high degree of symmetry between the upshifted and\ndownshifted elements.\nA more detailed comparison between the average O-mode\nand the average off results for the ion spectra from the pe-\nriod above is displayed in Fig. 10. This shows that the pair\nof upshifted and downshifted ion-acoustic lines have been\nenhanced by a factor of two, whereas the centre frequency\nhas been enhanced by more than three times. It is also\nclear that the separation of the two ion-lines has not been\naffected by SPEAR, which probably means that there has\nbeen no significant electron temperature change during the\n\u2019heating\u2019 process. The results in Figs. 7 to 10 are consis-\ntent with the excitation of both the parametric decay insta-\nbility (Fejer, 1979) and the purely-growing mode instability\n(Fejer and Leer, 1972) by three-wave interactions that also\nexcite electron-acoustic (plasma) waves close to \u00b14.9 MHz.\nStrictly, the parametric decay instability excites plasma-lines\nwhich are shifted from those excited by the purely-growing\ninstability by around half the ion spectral-width, i.e., by a few\nkHz. However the plasma-line spectral resolution of 13 kHz,\navailable in the present experiments, is insufficient to resolve\nthis separation.\nAlthough further transmissions of the same 12-min se-\nquences were subsequently attempted during the course of\nthe 27 April and the next two days, similar results to those\nseen during 12:00\u201312:12 UT on 27 April were seen only\nspasmodically. This was partly due to deteriorating iono-\nspheric conditions but also due to technical difficulties which\nled to a slowly reducing number of operating transmitters.\nAVERAGED ESR ION LINE SPECTRA FROM 27\/04\/2004\nHeater-on, 1307-1308 UT (solid), and heater-off, 1308-1309 UT (dashed), at 215 km altitude\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30\nFrequency (kHz)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\nFig 11\nFig. 11. As for Fig. 10, but at 5.2 MHz for 13:07\u201313:09 UT, 27\nApril 2004.\nThere was however a short burst of enhanced spectral power\nobserved for a few data dumps between 13:08 and 13:09 UT\non 27 April while SPEAR was operating at 5.2 MHz. The av-\nerage ion spectra from the 4 min of O-mode heating and the\n4 min of off are illustrated in Fig. 11. The results are similar\nto those in Fig. 10, but the enhancements are even greater.\nThe final point to make about the results from the first\ncampaign is that no SPEAR-induced CUTLASS backscat-\nter was seen at all. The reasons for this negative result are\nnot entirely clear. It is possible that the beam produced by\nthe incomplete SPEAR antenna array had an adverse effect\non the production of striations, although, the positive results\nfrom the ESR show that there were no such adverse effects\non the instabilities responsible for field-parallel scatter. An-\nother possibility is that adverse propagation conditions from\nthe CUTLASS radar sites to Svalbard were responsible for\nthe lack of coherent scatter, although this is not at all obvious\nfrom the ionogram information taken at the time.\n4.2 Results from the campaign of September\/October 2004\nIn contrast to the first SPEAR campaign, for the second cam-\npaign the SPEAR 6\u00d74 antenna-array was complete. This\nallowed slightly higher powers (15 MW ERP) to be used.\nApart from a slightly different choice of SPEAR operating\nfrequency, the only other differences in the way the experi-\nments were conducted was that for the second campaign an\n8-min heater sequence of 4-min on in O-mode and 4-min\noff was chosen. In many respects the results of ESR observa-\ntions from the second campaign mirrored those of the first. A\nparticularly strong example of the excitation of plasma-lines\nand ion spectral modification is illustrated in Fig. 12 (only\nthe upshifted plasma-line is illustrated and the altitude of\nthe strongly enhanced averaged ion-line spectrum was close\nto 200 km) for the period from 12:46\u201312:54 UT on 1 Oc-\ntober 2004. Here SPEAR was operated at 4.45 MHz in an\nionosphere with a maximum plasma frequency of 5.5 MHz.\nThe amplitudes of five spectral elements of ESR scatter are\nshown in Fig. 13 for the period 12:46\u201312:54 on 1 October\n300 T.

CUTLASS Finland radar range time amplitude plot showing the first observation of SPEAR induced scatter, 13:15\u201313:45 UT, 28\nSeptember 2004.\nThe long ranges involved, and the over-the-horizon propa-\ngation path, mean that the time-of-flight information is not\nsufficient to obtain the exact ground range of the backscatter\nover SPEAR. The fact that the CUTLASS signal can only\nreach SPEAR by reflection from both the sea surface and\nthe ionosphere (see Fig. 5) also adds to the uncertainty. De-\nspite these complications, the group-propagation range was\nfound to be approximately 230 km longer than that predicted\nby straight line propagation from CUTLASS Finland to an\naltitude 200 km directly above SPEAR. The continuous scat-\nter in the very near ranges in Fig. 14 is natural ground scat-\nter. The CUTLASS Iceland radar was not operating during\nthis period, due to power line maintenance that lasted from\n10:00\u201317:00 UT on 28 September 2004.\nDuring the sequences illustrated in Fig. 14, enhancements\nin the ESR plasma-line and ion spectral power were also\nobserved in addition to the CUTLASS backscatter above.\nTime-series of the CUTLASS backscatter power (averaged\nover the heated patch) for channel-A, together with those for\nthe five elements of the ESR backscatter data (as in Figs. 9\nand 13) are shown in Fig. 15 for the period from 13:20 to\n13:40 UT on 28 September 2004. Three periods of O-mode\nheating (13:20\u201313:24, 13:28\u201313:32 and 13:36\u201313:40 UT) are\nillustrated, separated by 4-min periods when SPEAR was off.\nSPEAR-enhanced CUTLASS (Finland) backscatter well\nin excess of 10 dB above background is evident in Fig. 15.\nAll of the ESR spectral features also exhibit enhancement to\nsome degree during SPEAR heating, though the variability\nin amplitude is greater than that in the corresponding CUT-\nLASS data (except during 13:36\u201313:40 UT). The enhance-\nments in the ion-line spectra in Fig. 15 appear somewhat\nsmaller than in previous examples above (apart from a large\nspike just after 13:31 UT), although the upshifted artificial\nplasma-line (panel e) is strongly enhanced. There is also sub-\nstantially more asymmetry between the upshifted and down-\nshifted plasma-line responses in this example than in others\npresented previously. These differences from previous exam-\nples may have been due to ionospheric conditions as evinced\nby the ionogram in Fig. 16 for 13:26 UT on 28 September\n2004, which was taken during a SPEAR-off period. This\nionogram exhibits significant spreading, which is indicative\nof patchy and uneven plasma densities, even though the max-\nimum plasma frequency appears to be above the transmission\nfrequency of SPEAR.\nAn example of a period of heating when SPEAR-induced\nbackscatter was observed in both the Iceland and Finland\nCUTLASS radars is illustrated in the amplitude time-series\nin Fig. 17. The upper two panels show the Finland and\nIceland backscatter data, respectively, and the bottom five\npanels contain the five ESR spectra similar to those in\nFigs. 9, 13 and 15, but here for 13:12\u201313:40 UT on 1 Oc-\ntober 2004, while SPEAR was operating at 4.45 MHz. The\nCUTLASS Finland data has 15 km range-resolution and 20 s\ntime-resolution at frequencies between 11.075\u201311.275 MHz,\nwhile the Iceland data has 45 km range-resolution and 36 s\ntime-resolution at frequencies between 12.6 to 13.3 MHz.\nThe differences in these aspects of the two CUTLASS data\nsets are due to the fact that the artificial scatter was only\nclearly seen in each radar with the different modes that\nwere described in Sect. 3.1 above. Ionospheric conditions\nwere considerably more stable during this period, than they\nwere for the results in Fig. 15, as is illustrated by the iono-\ngram data from 13:18 UT on 1 October 2004 (Fig. 18).\nStrong backscatter is seen in both of the CUTLASS radar\nT.

Svalbard ionogram for 13:26 UT, 28 September 2004.\nbe explained by the range cells for the Iceland radar being\nthree times longer than those at Finland. This increases the\nvolume of scatter and hence the effective scattering cross-\nsection by the same factor, assuming the scattering cross-\nsection to be homogeneous in range within a range-beam\ncell and the heated patch occupies several consecutive range\ngates (which it clearly does from Fig. 14). Artificial stria-\ntions are known to occupy a limited height range (Robinson,\n1989) and so do not fill the radar beams as far as elevation is\nconcerned. The vertical extent of the scatter is also limited by\naspect-sensitivity and refraction effects. However, the heat-\ning patch is wide enough to fill the CUTLASS beams as far\nas azimuth is concerned. This implies that the backscatter\npower should fall approximately at a rate inversely propor-\ntional to the third power of the range. On this basis it might\nbe expected that the Iceland backscatter power be reduced\nby 30% over the Finland backscatter power due to the 10%\nincrease in range from SPEAR. This suggests the Iceland\npower should be about twice those of Finland. The peak val-\nues seen at Iceland certainly exceed those at Finland by more\nthan this factor. This discrepancy probably deserves fur-\nther investigation. However, absolute comparisons of pow-\ners from two different radars are complicated by propaga-\ntion, especially with 1.5-hop modes over such large ranges,\nas well as the uncertainties introduced by aspect-angle con-\nsiderations.\nAlso in Fig. 17, all the ESR spectral powers show strong\nenhancements during the O-mode heating, although there\nis huge variability, especially in the period from 13:12\u2013\n13:16 UT, where an intense enhancement appears for about\n1 min after 13:14 UT. This enhancement also appears to co-\nincide with the rise of backscatter power in the CUTLASS\nIceland data, though the corresponding Finland data appear\nmore uniform in time. There is generally good correlation\nof the 4-min averaged data (corresponding to either SPEAR-\non or SPEAR-off periods) for all of the seven time-series in\nFig. 17, though the ESR data are in general more variable on\nshorter time-scales.\n5 Discussion and conclusions\nThe data presented above show clearly that the new SPEAR\nfacility is capable of generating enhancements in field-\naligned plasma density striations that produce artificial\naspect-sensitive scatter in the CUTLASS radars and also\nof generating enhancements in ion-acoustic waves, purely-\ngrowing (ion) modes and electron-acoustic waves which give\nrise to enhanced ESR scatter. Since one of the main pur-\nposes of SPEAR is to create artificial scatter for purposes of\ngeophysical space plasma exploration with CUTLASS, it is\nuseful to compare the efficiency of SPEAR with that of the\nTroms\u00f8 heater, with the proviso already mentioned concern-\ning direct comparisons between results from different sites.\nAs has been pointed out already, the SPEAR heater has op-\nerated so far only at ERP levels of 15 MW, while the Troms\u00f8\nheater is capable of 200 MW or more. An example of CUT-\nLASS (Finland) backscatter measurements at Troms\u00f8 on one\nof the few occasions when the heater there was operating at\npowers considerably less than this is illustrated in Fig. 19 for\n12:20\u201312:40 UT on 7 October 1997. Even this experiment\nwas not ideal for comparison with SPEAR, due to the nature\nof some of the heater-on periods, as described below.\nThe lower panel in Fig. 19 indicates the ERP level of\nthe Troms\u00f8 heater. As is clear, the heater-on from 12:21\u2013\n12:22 UT was at a constant power level, as was each sub-\nsequent alternate heater-on. In between the constant power\nheater-on periods were interspersed more complicated power\nvariations, which involved the heater being on initially at\nfull-power for 20 s, before reverting to a lower power for\nT.

Svalbard ionogram for 13:18 UT, 1 October 2004.\nFinland site to that of the Troms\u00f8 heater is a little under\n1000 km. On the basis of the inverse cube power law al-\nready mentioned, this would mean that for the same scatter-\ning cross-section, and the same range cell size, CUTLASS\nbackscatter power from Troms\u00f8 should be around 7 to 8\ntimes that from SPEAR. The Troms\u00f8 heater power levels in\nFig. 19 which best compare with those at SPEAR occur in\nthe interval from 12:29 to 12:30 UT when the Troms\u00f8 heater\nwas transmitting 15 MW ERP. The corresponding enhance-\nment in the CUTLASS backscatter was about 300 times\nabove background. The corresponding levels for SPEAR are\naround 50 times (from Fig. 17). These levels are therefore\nroughly comparable with those which might be expected on\nthe basis of the Troms\u00f8 results.\nAlso displayed in Fig. 19 (middle panel) are the central\nunshifted component of the ion-line backscatter data from\nthe EISCAT UHF radar observed over the same period as the\nCUTLASS backscatter data. They exhibit very clearly the\nwell-known ion-line overshoot phenomenon which has been\na ubiquitous feature of heating experiments at Troms\u00f8. It is\ntypified by a strong enhancement of the ion-line power for a\nshort period (usually no more than one data dump) immedi-\nately after heater turn on, followed by the (almost complete)\ndisappearance of the enhancement for the rest of the time\nthe heater is on. There are a few observations at Troms\u00f8\nthat indicate that the ion-line does not entirely disappear, but\nrather its amplitude falls to a level 10 to 20 dB below its ini-\ntial peak (Djuth et al., 1994; Dhillon and Robinson, 2005).\nIon-line overshoot effects are present at all ERP levels in\nFig. 19, apart from the lowest of 3.5 MW which occurred\nbetween 12:21\u201312:22 UT. Notice also that there is no sign of\nany ion-line intensity enhancement after the overshoot spike\nin the Troms\u00f8 data in Fig. 19. Indeed, there is evidence that\nthe ion-line power falls to levels below that during heater-off\nfor a short time after the overshoot spike (although this lat-\nter effect in probably due to a reduction in the UHF radar\npower output as a result of switching on the heater). On\nthis basis it might be expected that a strong overshoot effect\nshould be discernable in the SPEAR ESR data. From what\nhas been reported above this is clearly not the case. There is\nno sign of systematic overshoot occurring in the SPEAR ex-\nperiments. There are a few periods when it might be argued\nthat there are signs of it. For example, in Fig. 9, just after\n12:04 UT, in Fig. 13, just after 12:48 UT and in Fig. 17 just\nafter 13:20 UT. However, these are the only times when it\nappears after SPEAR is turned on amongst many other times\nwhen SPEAR is turned on without any sign of overshoot.\nFurthermore, in all of these cases there are several further\nspikes in the ESR spectral power while SPEAR is on, which\nis not seen in the data from Troms\u00f8 (Fig. 19).\nThere is evidence that overshoot related phenomena are\nabsent when the heater frequency is very close to a harmonic\nof the electron gyro-frequency (Honary et al., 1999), but un-\nder these conditions field-aligned striations are not generated\neither and hence no aspect-sensitive scatter would be seen.\nIndeed, as has been pointed out in the introduction, it has\nbeen argued that overshoot is caused by anomalous absorp-\ntion of the heater wave due to the striations at an altitude be-\nlow that from which the non aspect-sensitive scatter comes.\nThis is clearly inconsistent with the data from the SPEAR\nexperiments where several examples of simultaneous CUT-\nLASS scatter and ESR scatter have been observed. Further,\nthese results have been seen with several SPEAR operating\nfrequencies, all of which have been chosen to avoid harmon-\nics of the local electron gyro-frequency.\nAnother consideration in the context of the differences in\nheating effects seen at Troms\u00f8 and on Spitzbergen is the dif-\nference between the operating frequencies of the ESR and\nmainland EISCAT radars. The ESR works at frequencies\nclose to 500 MHz, whereas the UHF radar responsible for the\nT. R.

The EISCAT heater was operating at\n4.544 MHz and the time and range resolution of the ESCAT UHF radar data were 5 s and 22 km, respectively.\ndata from Troms\u00f8 in Fig. 19 operates at 931 MHz. However,\nit is unlikely that these frequency differences explain the lack\nof overshoot in the ESR data, since the VHF EISCAT radar\nat Troms\u00f8, which operates at 224 MHz, also shows clear ev-\nidence of overshoot during heating experiments (Kohl et al.,\n1993).\n308 T. R. Robinson et al.: SPEAR-induced artificial backscatter from CUTLASS and EISCAT Svalbard radars\nYet another consideration which might help to explain the\napparent lack of overshoot during the SPEAR experiments is\nthe condition of the ionosphere itself. There is no doubt that\nduring all of the SPEAR observations undertaken so far, the\namplitude data appear to exhibit rather high levels of vari-\nability. The ionograms taken during both SPEAR campaigns\nalso exhibited a level of spreading consistent with somewhat\npatchy plasma density distributions. This kind of structur-\ning is to be expected in the polar ionosphere. This, together\nwith the inevitable drifting of plasma under even weak nat-\nural electric fields or neutral winds would mean that plasma\nwould not be constantly heated. The plasma density variabil-\nity would also lead to strong local fluctuations in the elec-\ntric field strength of the heater wave, due to focussing and\ndefocusing effects, so that threshold levels required to trig-\nger instabilities would only be exceeded for short periods\nwithin the whole of the 4-min on-period. Since the time-\nconstant for the excitation of the instabilities which give\nrise to the ESR scatter, as discussed in the introduction, is\nmuch shorter than that for the instabilities which give rise\nto the CUTLASS scatter, the ESR data would be expected\nto be much more variable than the CUTLASS data, because\nthe instabilities involved would be continually being excited\nand decaying on short time-scales. The longer time-scales\nfor the CUTLASS-related instabilities would have a relative\nsmoothing effect on the CUTLASS backscatter amplitudes.\nThis difference in variability could be further exaggerated in\nthe ESR data by the small ESR beam cross-sectional area\n(about 1 km2) compared to the CUTLASS range-beam cell\narea (about 200 km2). Sampling over a larger area would\nalso have a smoothing effect on the CUTLASS amplitude\ndata, which is consistent with what is observed. However,\nthis latter explanation of the lack of consistent overshoot\nduring SPEAR heating is rather speculative and not entirely\nconvincing. It thus must remain tentative in the absence of\nany other experimental evidence. Further observations of the\ntype reported above are essential, hopefully involving more\nstable ionospheric conditions as we move towards solar max-\nimum and also higher SPEAR transmitter powers, as confi-\ndence is gained in operating the new system.\nFinally, as mentioned earlier, there is no evidence of bulk\nheating effects, such as large-scale changes in electron tem-\nperature or density occurring, so far, during heating experi-\nments with SPEAR. Experience with the Troms\u00f8 heater has\nshown that large changes in these parameters can occur. Ri-\netveld et al. (2003) have reported temperature changes of sev-\neral thousands of degrees, although Robinson et al. (1997),\nreported much smaller bulk effects at similar heater pow-\ners. The response to heating depends on both the transmitted\npower of the heater and ionospheric conditions. The absence\nof large-scale heating effects with SPEAR is most likely due\nto a combination of lower transmitted power compared to the\nTroms\u00f8 heater as well as the generally more variable iono-\nspheric conditions above Svalbard, already mentioned.\nAcknowledgements.
