The methodology adopted is qualitative, \nfocusing on inquiry-based learning which enabled the authors to gather data on those aspects \nof context that relate specifically to the leadership roles executives switch between.   \n \nFindings \nChanging role is found to facilitate improvement in each executive\u2019s decision-making \neffectiveness, and over time, in the decision-making capability of an organisation\u2019s wider senior \nmanagement team. \n \nResearch Limitations \/ Implications \nA one-organisation intensive case study of a multinational engineering company engaged in the \ndesign, development and manufacture of rotating turbomachinery provides the platform for the \nresearch.  The concepts advanced will require validating in other organisations of both similar \nand different demographic profiles. \n \nPractical Implications \nThe concepts advanced, and implications discussed, provide an insight into the nature of \nleadership as a network of relationships.  The practical steps individual executives can take to \ndevelop their ability to adopt different leadership roles are highlighted. \n \nOriginality \/ Value \nThis article attempts to assist executives within the wider senior management team to better \nadapt and coordinate their behaviour with other executives.  In so doing, it is suggested that \nexecutives contribute more positively to the organisational decision-making processes and \nwider senior management team interaction by being adaptive and responsive to changes in \ntheir surrounding context. \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 3 of 34 \n \nIntroduction. \nOrganisations are made up of differences and contrasts (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 1999: \n147).  What one person feels is valuable and should be preserved, someone else may wish to change.  \nOver time some may change their point of view, while others rigidly stick to their ideas.  However, \nin order to live and work together, bridges need to be built between people who hold differences of \nperspective. \n \nThe allocation and switching of roles has become accepted as a mechanism for building \nbridges between individuals and so facilitating the effective contribution of an individual within the \nwork place to a team (Belbin, 1981; Belbin, 1993; Furnham et al, 1993; Dulewicz, 1995; Parkinson, \n1995; Broucek & Randall, 1996; Fischer et al, 1996; Senior, 1998; Partington & Harris, 1999).  \nIndeed it has long been argued (Parsons, 1951) that the relationship between an individual and their \nsituation may be characterised in terms of role.  Parsons (1951) defines role in terms of a \u201cnormative \nconsensus\u201d that sets limits on acceptable behavioural patterns for individuals occupying a specific \nrole, recognising the positive effect that appropriately distributed roles can have on the process and \nacknowledging differences.  This article examines how switching roles within an organisation\u2019s \nwider senior management team facilitated each executive\u2019s contribution to the organisational \ndecision-making process and as a consequence senior management team task accomplishment. \n \nLeadership research may be broadly characterised by the continued development and testing \nof generalisable theoretical frameworks to explain the effects of pre-existing executive and senior \nmanagement team characteristics on an organisation\u2019s performance (Gupta & Govindarajan, 1984; \nEisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990; Miller, 1991; Wiersema & Bantel, 1992).  Some researchers \nfocus on the use of historical documentation when establishing a link between characteristics and \nperformance (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1990; Hambrick et al, 1996) while others have used quasi-\nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 4 of 34 \nexperimental methods to link characteristics and performance (Boon et al, 1998; Carpenter & \nGolden, 1997).  Few studies have considered organisational outcomes in terms of psychological \ninfluences; however Miller et al (1982) and Boon & De Bradander (1996) have considered \nexecutive\u2019s locus of control and Kets de Vries & Miller (1984) have contemplated executive\u2019s \nneuroses. \n \nA further branch of leadership research has been that of identifying relationships between the \ncharacteristics of executives and the effectiveness of the organisation, while at the same time being \ncriticised (Boal & Hooijberg, 2001; Cannella & Monroe, 1997) for its positivist form.  Positivism \nassumes that the researcher is a sort of \u201cspectator\u201d of the object of enquiry (Chia, 2002; 7).  Reality \nis assumed to unproblematically exist \u201cout there\u201d independent of the perceptions, beliefs and biases \nof the researcher.  For positivists, sound research consists of the \u201cundistorted\u201d recording of \nobservations obtained through efficiency-driven methods of investigation and the use of precise \nterminologies and classification in the process of documentation (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2005).  \nExplanations regarding the observed pattern of regularities connecting one set of phenomena with \nanother can then be systematically developed and empirically verified. \n \nThe research described in this article addresses the question of the extent to which a role \nbased perspective on leadership can provide a basis for senior management team task \naccomplishment.  The approach adopted focuses on individuals\u2019 interpretations of their environment \nand of their own and other\u2019s behaviour, and in so doing helps to explain how characteristics of \nexecutives are related.  To address this question the authors adopted an action research approach \n(Lewin, 1946; Eden & Huxham, 1996), in contrast to a positivist approach.  Action research \n(Bryman, 1989: 135) falls into the family of research methodologies broadly referred to as inquiry-\nbased learning (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2005).  Action research focuses on individual\u2019s \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 5 of 34 \ninterpretations of their environment and of their own and others\u2019 behaviour, and in so doing helps to \nexplain how characteristics of executives are related. \n \nIn this article the authors first examine the literature on leadership that supports a role-based \nperspective.  A methodology section that explains and justifies the data-gathering strategy follows.  \nThe framework that emerges from the gathered data is then described.  The framework highlights \npractical steps individual executives can take to develop their ability to adopt different roles.  \nChanging roles was found to facilitate improvement in each executive\u2019s decision-making \neffectiveness, and over time the decision-making effectiveness of the wider senior management \nteam.  The article concludes with a consideration of the implications for both leadership theory and \nthe practising executive. \n \nA Role Based Perspective of Leadership. \nThere have been as many as sixty-five different systems developed to define the dimensions \nof leadership (Fleishman et al, 1991).  In his comprehensive review of leadership theory and practice \nNorthouse (2004) observed that despite the multiple ways leadership has been conceptualised two \ncomponents can be identified as central to the phenomena of leadership: \n \n\u2022 Leadership is a process.  It is not a linear, one-way event but rather an \ninteractive event. \n \n\u2022 Leadership occurs in groups.  Groups provide the context in which \nleadership takes place. \n \nNorthouse\u2019s (2004) perspective on leadership facilitates the sharing of leadership challenges \nand responsibilities.  The tasks of leadership are not restricted only to the formally designated leader \nin a group. \n \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 6 of 34 \nWhen considering how individuals interact within groups, Surowiecki (2004: 86) observed \nthat independent decision making within groups was pointless, as what one individual is willing to \ndo depends on what that individual thinks others in the group are going to do, and vice versa.  \nAccording to Surowiecki (2004) dependency exists within a group when group members are capable \nof action independently of other group members.  As other group members are capable of action \nover which each individual group member has no control, the individual group members must \nconsider the implications of other\u2019s response when contemplating what action to take themselves.  \nPerhaps paradoxically it is the independence of individual group members that results in dependency \nwithin the group.  Surowiecki (2004) goes on to say that as a result of the dependency between \nmembers of a group, there is no guarantee the group will emerge with good solutions to those \nproblems it faces.  What Surowiecki (2004) discovered, however, was that despite the issue of \ndependency, groups do make what he terms \u201csmart\u201d decisions far more often than could be \nexplained by random chance.  The conclusion Surowiecki (2004) reached was that within those \ngroups that made smart decisions, individuals were coordinating their behaviour with other group \nmembers, even if they were not consciously aware of the fact they were doing so.  In all Surowiecki \n(2004) identified three challenges if the group was to make smart decisions: \n \n\u2022 Cooperation.  The challenge of inducing self-interested distrustful people to \nwork together, even when narrow self-interest would seem to dictate that no \nindividual should take part. \n \n\u2022 Coordination.  Members of a group must figure out how to coordinate their \nbehaviour, knowing that everyone else is trying to do the same. \n \n\u2022 Cognition.  Collectively solving problems that have or will have definite \nsolutions to which there may not be a single right answer, but to which \nsome answers are certainly better then others. \n \nThe issue of cooperation may be considered to be the problem of gathering together those \nwho can contribute to resolving a specific organisational issue.  Attempting to gather group \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 7 of 34 \nmembers with appropriate skills in turn leads to a problem of coordination, ensuring that a particular \ngroup does indeed contain all those who have knowledge and experience relevant to the issue at \nhand.  If all the relevant individuals are successfully brought together, the problem becomes one of \ncognition, as data is gathered, analysed, shared and feedback is received within the social system the \ngroup has become. \n \nParsons (1951) emphasises that all actions available to an individual within a social system \nare a function of the relationship between the individual and their situation.  He characterises the \nrelationship between an individual and his or her situation in terms of role, which is described as the \nprimary point of direct articulation between personality of the individual and the structure of the \nsocial system.  Theoreticians and practitioners, therefore, view roles as the basic elements of a social \nsystem; Belbin (1993: 31) defined roles in the broad sense as clusters of behaviours.  Belbin\u2019s \n(1993) observations suggest that by recognising the roles of others and by becoming aware of the \nrange of roles that are available to one self, people learn to modify their behaviour to take account of \nthe situation.  When specifically considering leadership Belbin (2000: 17) observed: \n \n\u201cThe quintessential feature of a small well-balanced team is that leadership is shared and \nrotates.  As critical issues arise, different individuals come to the fore and make their special \ncontribution.\u201d \n \nThe theoretical roots of role making were reviewed by Seers et al (2003: 82) who observed \nthat over decades of research the basic process of role differentiation has been documented.  With \nrespect to leadership, Bass\u2019s (1949) analysis noted that two individual group members often \nemerged into complementary roles.  One of these leaders was generally the member most respected \nfor his contributions to the accomplishment of tasks within the group.  The other was generally the \nbest-liked member, who was most respected for his contribution and support of friendly interaction \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 8 of 34 \namongst members.  Similar results were reported by Carter (1954), Slater (1955), Borgatta & Blaes \n(1956), Bales & Slater (1955) and Bales (1958). \n \nThe above early studies are focused on role differentiation, however it is important to note \nthat not all of these studies consistently showed the same emergence of two high-status leadership \nroles and resulting follower roles for the remaining group members.  Bales & Slater (1955) found \nthat member roles were also differentiated by member activity, with Slater (1955) observing that the \ndegree of group consensus in the identification of the status hierarchy was related to the pattern of \nrole differentiation.  The strongest consensus was generally achieved when the two most active \nindividuals emerged into the task specialist and relationship specialist roles.  Consensus was lowest \nwhen the most active member did not score highly in either task or relationship dimensions, \nindicating that group level conflict reduced when active group members emerged into a distinct \nleadership role. \n \nGriffin (2002) studied the roles of leaders, and argues that there is complexity in the \ninterdependency of people in a large organisation in the moment of the living present, and that the \nfocus of attention must be on everyday interactions between people in their local situation.  Griffin \n(2002) concludes that it is through this interaction that roles emerge, including the roles of leaders.  \nThe perspective of Griffin (2002) is again helpful when considering how to characterise the roles of \nleaders.  He argues that the roles of leaders must be considered in terms of the everyday interaction \nbetween individuals in their local situations.  Characterising the roles of leaders must therefore be \nundertaken utilising a research method that considers the actions of individual executives in there \nlocal situations. \n \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 9 of 34 \nIn terms of discrete roles, Sheard & Kakabadse (2002a) developed a perspective on \nleadership using an ethnographic methodology whereby the roles of leaders were defined in terms of \nfour distinct categories legitimate, social, task and macro.  Sheard & Kakabadse (2002a) concluded \nthat is was necessary to subdivide the subject leadership if those in leadership positions were to be \nprovided with a deeper insight into the impact of their own behaviour. \n \nThe legitimate leader was defined by Sheard & Kakabadse (2002a) as the publicly appointed \nleader of the team who is accountable for delivery of the team\u2019s objectives.  The social leader was \ndefined as the individual who undertakes to build a network of relationships with other team \nmembers.  Sheard & Kakabadse (2002a) regarded task leaders as deriving their legitimacy to lead \nother team members from the formal allocation of responsibility for delivering a specific task by the \nteam\u2019s legitimate leader.  The macro leadership role was defined as the leadership role played by a \nsenior executive when interacting with the team.  The senior executive brings a \u201cmacro\u201d view of the \norganisation to the team, and whilst Sheard & Kakabadse (2002a) observed that although the time \nthe organisation\u2019s senior executives spent interacting with any one team was relatively small, the \nimpact this had on the team was found to be great.  Sheard & Kakabadse (2002a) concluded that it \nwas entirely possible for every individual within a group to occupy one of the four leadership roles.  \nFurther, the ability of executives to adopt complementary leadership roles to other group members \nwas closely correlated to their own effectiveness as a leader. \n \nMethodology. \nIn the inquiry that is the subject of this article, the authors studied the extent to which a role-\nbased perspective on leadership can provide insight into a senior management team\u2019s formal \nmechanism for task accomplishment.  To examine this issue the authors selected a number of \nexecutives who were used for the basis of the inquiry.  These were drawn from the wider senior \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 10 of 34 \nmanagement team of a single organisation, with inquiry focused on executive\u2019s interpretations of \ntheir environment and of their own and other\u2019s behaviour. \n \nAction research (Bryman, 1989: 135) focuses on individual\u2019s interpretations of their \nenvironment and of their own and others behaviour.  The term \u201caction research\u201d refers to a form of \nqualitative research which, broadly, results from an involvement by the researcher with members of \nan organisation over a matter that is of genuine concern to them and in which there is an intent by \nthe organisation\u2019s members to take action based on the intervention.  Qualitative research tends to \nemphasise individual\u2019s interpretations of their environment and of their own and other\u2019s behaviour.  \nSensitivity to what people say and to the context in which their actions take place is a primary \nconsideration of action research.  When characterising action research Kakabadse & Kakabadse \n(2005) defined its primary purpose to be facilitating change at individual and organisational levels.  \nIn this context improvement is achieved through at-the-moment awareness of how actions and \nemotions are affecting decision-making effectiveness.   \n \nClassical action research starts from the idea that if you want to change something \neffectively you need to understand it (French & Bell, 1978; Hodman, 1979).  Easterly-Smith et al \n(2002) consider that the following two features are normally part of any action research project: \n \n\u2022 A belief that the best way of learning about an organisation or social system \nis through attempting to change it, and this should to some extent be the \nobjective of the action research. \n \n\u2022 A belief that those people most likely to be affected by, or involved in \nimplementing these changes should as far as possible become involved in \nthe research process itself. \n \nWhilst characterising action research Eden & Huxham (2002) observed that theory \nelaboration and development is an explicit concern of the research process.  New theory is expressed \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 11 of 34 \nthrough the design of tools, techniques, models and frameworks.  Eden & Huxham (2002) contend \nthat the basis for tool, technique, model or framework design must be explicit and shown to be \nrelated to the theories that comprise the researcher\u2019s \u201cpre-understanding\u201d.  It is accepted that the \nresearcher brings a preconception, a starting theoretical position to the inquiry (Gummesson, 1991).  \nAwareness of preconceptions is an important consideration towards the latter stages of the project.  \nIt is therefore important to move towards reflecting on the role of pre-understanding only as theories \nbegin to emerge.  Deferring reflection in this way may be regarded as a middle way between the \npositions taken by Glaser (1992) who argues for complete suppression of pre-understanding and \nAlderfer (1993) who favours a hypothesis-testing approach to action research. \n \nAs the nature of each action research intervention is determined by its immediate context, \naction research does not lend itself to replication of empirical data.  However action research based \norganisational interventions do provide an opportunity to test complex theoretical frameworks.  \nTheory develops from a synthesis of that which emerges from data and that which emerges from the \nuse in practice of theory influenced by the researcher\u2019s pre-understanding.  As such Eden & \nHuxham (2002) contend that it is unusual for action research to deliver fundamentally new theories, \nbut that the theories tested influence the actions of all those engaged in the inquiry.  Sutton & Shaw \n(1995) described theory thus: \n \n\u201cTheory is about connections among phenomena, a story about why acts, events, structure and \nthoughts occur.\u201d \n \nThe process of testing theories influences actions of those engaged in the inquiry by \nilluminating how acts and events are related.  By implication, therefore \u201cemergent\u201d theory draws \nattention away from those aspects of the situation that are not included in the theory.  Emergent \ntheory is instrumental in helping those participating in action research to understand cause and effect \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 12 of 34 \nwithin their specific context.  A key strength of action research is that its basis in action means that \ncausality is established as a consequence of what people do in circumstances that really matter to \nthem, as opposed to what they say they would do in hypothetical situations. \n \nThe action research process may be considered as an interweaving of the consulting process \nwith the research process.  The Consulting involves providing a solution to the specific issues that \nprompted the intervention (Eden & Huxham, 2002: 261).  In this article, design of a post-merger \norganisational structure was the principal author\u2019s consultancy contribution following merger of \nthree organisations.  The research process is the process of drawing out theory during the \nintervention.  The label \u201caction research\u201d is appropriate only when the emerging theory informs the \naction taken during the consulting process. \n \nStudy. \nOne of the main concerns following the merger was establishment of an integrated post-\nmerger organisational structure.  The three organisations each employed approximately 1,400 staff, \ngiving the combined organisation a total of 4,200 employees.  Each organisation had its own \nproduction centres plus global network of sales offices and distributors.  The senior management \nteam of the newly merged organisation estimated that a harmonised and integrated organisation \ncould offer the same range of products and services with a 20% reduction in staff.  In this context \nthe senior management team is defined as the organisation\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and \nthose who report to the CEO directly.  To deliver the reduction, however, integration was required \nof the original organisations into an entirely new structure. \n \nDuring design of the post merger organisational structure the authors had observed that some \nexecutives were actively involved in the decision making process, whilst some seemed unable to \ncontribute at all.  Executives within the organisation had their own explanations as to why this was \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 13 of 34 \nthe case.  Typically the CEO would offer examples of executives \u2018outstanding personal qualities\u2019 as \nthe \u2018reason\u2019 why they were so influential during the decision making process, with little evidence to \nsupport the assertion.  The authors formed the view that first and foremost it was necessary to take \ninto account the explanations of the executives involved, whilst also remaining objective enough to \ntake into account the context within which the decision making process was taking place.  To this \nend it was necessary to get close to and actually work with the executives involved as decisions \nregarding design of the new organisational structure were made and implemented. \n \nThe authors negotiated access to the organisation over an eighteen-month period, working \nwith the senior management team in a variety of contexts: board meetings, staff meetings with \nmiddle managers, coffee breaks and casual conversations.  Daily field notes were taken and \nunstructured interviews conducted throughout the project.  Towards the end of the project semi-\nstructured interviews were carried out with the executives that comprised the senior management \nteam plus approximately 20% of the executives who comprised the wider senior management team.  \nIn this context the wider senior management team is defined as the one hundred most senior \nexecutives within the organisation who were each year invited by the CEO to attend the \norganisation\u2019s annual management conference.   \n \nThe first six months of the project were characterised by observation and unstructured \ninterview.  The authors recognised that the senior management team spent less then three days a \nmonth attending meetings as a single large group.  The remainder of executives\u2019 time was spent \nworking in informal groups with their peers, or more formally with those who reported to them.  The \nmajority of the time executives did spend together was spent in discussion regarding a different \nissue each time they met.  The issues typically discussed related to the operational consequence of \nstrategic decisions, for example the strategic decision to have only one legal entity in each of the 31 \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 14 of 34 \ncountries within which the post merger organisation operated.  When this decision was announced, \nthose executives affected recognised the likelihood of their becoming part of the 20% reduction in \nstaff associated with the post merger harmonisation and integration.  Each found different ways to \nbring to the senior management team\u2019s attention those consequences that would follow closure or \nmerger of the entity for which they were responsible. \n \nThe approach most commonly adopted by executives was to seek guidance from the senior \nmanagement team as to which legal entity in a particular country should respond to an unusually \nlarge request for quotation from an important client.  Generally the executive making the request \nwould be running one of two legal entities in a country, be the likely choice for closure, and \nsimultaneously alone possess the necessary capability to convert the request for quotation into an \norder.  A second strategy adopted by executives who felt their organisation was under threat of \nclosure was to seek approval to hire staff or purchase capital equipment, to enable completion of \norders already taken.  Such requests exposed the truth that whilst a decision to have one legal entity \nper country had been taken, and was ultimately fully implemented, the operational consequences of \nthe decision were not thought through at the time it was announced.  As a result executives within \nthe senior management team found themselves spending time in both formal and informal meetings, \nmaking tactical decisions about how the new structure would function.  As soon as a decision was \nmade regarding the issue that had prompted a meeting, executives would immediately scatter to take \nphone calls, check emails and generally address other urgent problems.   \n \nWhen the authors reviewed their field notes, they observed that some executives spent up to \n50% of their time in informal small groups with peers and subordinates discussing operational \nconsequences and issues associated with the strategic move to a single legal entity per country, \nwhilst others spent no more then 5% of their time voluntarily contributing to informal small group \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 15 of 34 \ndebate.  When the senior management team as a large group discussed the issues executives had \nbeen intensively discussing in small groups, the authors realised that a collective senior management \nteam decision was made quickly. \n \nThe authors also observed that a decision made after intensive small group discussion was \nmore likely to be implemented, in contrast to decisions made relating to issues raised by executives \nwho had not debated them before hand with small groups of their peers and subordinates.  Due to \nthe tight time scales associated with responding to client requests for quotation, for example, it was \nrelatively easy for executives in the wider senior management team to make \u2018mistakes\u2019 if a decision \nwent against them.  These mistakes were something that happened more regularly when an issue \nwas associated with a member of the senior management team who choose not to debate it \ninformally with peers and subordinates prior to a large group senior management team meeting.  The \nauthors speculated that the way in which executives were working in small groups facilitated more \neffective senior management team decision-making. \n \nThe authors spent the second six months of the project involved in discussions with \nexecutives on a daily basis.  The authors focused specifically on those issues executives were \naddressing in small groups with other executives.  Approximately one hundred of these discussions \nwere considered significant enough to record.  Each of these discussions was regarded as a separate \nand distinct data set.  Each data set contained approximately fifteen \u201cbatches\u201d of data that \ncollectively summarised significant aspects of the discussion. \n \nTwelve months into the project, the data within each data set was reviewed.  The data itself \nwas regarded as \"evidence\" that was collected together into groups that related to a similar theme.  \nThe authors then generated an \u201cemerging truth\u201d in the style of Lewin (1946), summarising the theme \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 16 of 34 \nthey considered the data supported.  In this context the authors consider that an emerging truth is \nverifiable from experience or observation, with the collected data comprising evidence of the \nauthors experience and observations.  When considering how best to design an action research \nprogram, Eden & Huxham (2002: 262) observed that the exact nature of reflection is relatively \nimmaterial.  Two specific characteristics of good quality action research are, however, defined: \n \n\u2022 For good quality action research a high degree of systematic method and \norderliness is required in reflecting about, and holding on to, the research \ndata and the emergent theoretical outcomes of each episode or cycle of \ninvolvement in the organisation. \n \n\u2022 For action research, the process of exploring the data, rather then collecting \nthe data \u2013 in the detecting of emergent theories and development of existing \ntheories, must be replicable or, at least, capable of being explained by \nothers. \n \nThe process of capturing significant conversations as batches of data and then collating data \ninto groups relating to a similar theme is the process of complying with the first of Eden & \nHuxham\u2019s (2002) requirements.  The formal recording of each group of data and the emerging truth \nthe authors considered it to support is the process adopted for complying with the second. \n \nIn total 92 separate \u201cemerging truths\u201d were generated in this way, supported by 1,357 \ndistinct batches of data.  When the authors reviewed the emerging truths, it became apparent they \nrelated to similar themes.  The decision was made to repeat the process used to generate emerging \ntruths, aggregating emerging truths together into groups relating to a similar theme.  A single \n\u201chypothesis\u201d was then generated by the authors, which they considered the collected emerging truths \nsupported.  In this context the authors defined a hypothesis as \u201ca suggested explanation for a group \nof emerging truths, accepted as a basis for further verification\u201d.  Eight of these hypotheses emerged, \nwhich the authors recognised could each be associated with one of the \u201ckey factors\u201d proposed by \nSheard & Kakabadse (2002b). \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 17 of 34 \n \nSheard & Kakabadse (2002b) proposed that the transformation of a group into an effective \nteam could be regarded as the process of developing a supportive group social structure, with each \nindividual adapting his behaviour to optimise his personal contribution to the group.  Sheard & \nKakabadse (2002b) argued that the contribution of an individual to a group could be conceptualised \nin terms of key factors.  The data gathered during the current study related to the contribution of \nindividuals to the groups of which they were a part.  Key factors were originally developed from a \nconsideration of the contribution of an individual to a group.  The authors concluded that the \napproach to data gathering during the current study was self-consistent with the intent that informed \ndevelopment of the key factors, and it was therefore valid to associate emerging hypotheses with key \nfactors. \n \nSheard & Kakabadse (2002b) considered the contribution of an individual to a group in \nterms of leadership and eight key factors: \n \n(1) Clearly Defined Goals \n(2) Priorities \n(3) Roles & Responsibilities \n(4) Self Awareness \n(5) Group Dynamics \n(6) Communication \n(7) Context \n(8) Infrastructure \n \nThe key factor\u2019s conceptual foundations are rooted within the work of Adair (1986).  It has \nbeen postulated by Adair (1986) that \u2018groups\u2019 at the most generic level share certain common needs, \nand those needs can be categorised into three basic elements; task, group and individual.  Adair \n(1986: 121) concludes that a leader\u2019s core responsibility is to simultaneously achieve the task, build \nand maintain the group and develop the individual.  Sheard & Kakabadse (2002b) developed the \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 18 of 34 \nwork of Adair (1986), concluding that when contemplating leadership a lower level of granularity \nwas required.  In this context granularity is defined as the level of detail into which a subject is \nsubdivided.  Using the basic elements of Adair (1986) as their starting point, Sheard & Kakabadse \n(2002b) went on to expand and subdivide the basic elements into key factors. \n \nThe key factors were discussed and debated by the authors with executives from whom data \nhad originally been gathered.  The objective of these discussions was to verify that the executives \ninvolved could indeed contemplate their action as being associated with one of the key factors.  To \nfacilitate the discussion the authors and executives involved used the work of Sheard & Kakabadse \n(2002b) to develop and agree a definition for each of the key factors, Table One.  The authors \nrealised with mounting excitement that executives could conceptualise different actions as being \nwithin the scope of different key factors. \n \nTake in Table One. \n \nIn parallel to the above data classification exercise, the authors reviewed data sets, and \nconsidered the role played by the executive who had been interviewed.  The authors recognised that \nby considering the leadership an executive was providing in terms of discrete role, they could assign \nthe executive one of Sheard & Kakabadse\u2019s (2002a) four leadership roles macro, legitimate, social \nor task.  The four-category model of Sheard & Kakabadse (2002a) was selected as it was developed \nin a context within which the groups being studied were faced with finding solutions to problems for \nwhich there was no single correct answer.  A feature of the problems executives were addressing in \nthe current study was, also, that there was no single correct answer.  The authors therefore \nconcluded that there was similarity between the context within which the four-category leadership \nmodel had been developed, and into which it was now being applied. \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 19 of 34 \n \nA second factor influencing the choice of leadership model was that the more traditional role \nbased models of leadership, Bass (1949) for example, whilst identifying two individuals as emerging \ninto high status leadership roles, still characterised remaining group members as adopting follower \nroles.  During small group discussion with the executives participating in the current study it became \nclear that whilst some occasionally considered themselves to be \u2018first amongst equals\u2019 as a \nconsequence of having a particular skill relevant to a specific issue, none regarded themselves as \nfollowers.  As such other models of leadership seemed less appropriate to the current study, and \ntherefore were not adopted during the data classification exercise. \n \nThe data classification exercise became significant in two ways.  First, it was instrumental in \nhighlighting that the evidence collectively could be considered in terms of key factors.  Secondly, \neach data set of evidence could simultaneously be used to associate the executive involved with a \nleadership role.  The insight that the data could be both viewed in terms of key factors and \nleadership roles led the authors to conclude that leadership roles could be described in terms of key \nfactors. \n \nAs the idea that leadership roles could be considered in terms of key factors emerged, \nadditional data sets were collected from executives previously not involved.  The intent was to \nverify that the leadership roles could be considered in terms of key factors when data was gathered \nfrom a wider group of executives.  Introducing executives to leadership roles and describing them in \nterms of key factors continued the theory development during the last six months of the project.  In \nsmall groups executives discussed the features, focus and attendant key factors of each leadership \nrole, and the leadership roles each had occupied in different situations.  This prompted a lively \ndebate as to which key factors were most relevant to each leadership role. \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 20 of 34 \nResults. \nThe executives involved recognised that their ability to contribute positively towards the \ndecision making process within a small group was enhanced by associating themselves and others \nwith a leadership role.  The association of different key factors with each leadership role helped \nexecutives to focus on the key factors most relevant, given the leadership role they were occupying.  \nThis in turn helped executives make a positive contribution to the group of which they were a part, \nreducing overlap with the roles of other group members and in doing so reducing group level \nconflict.  A key issue the executives faced, however, was their constant movement between those \ngroups in which they worked.  The executives each had busy schedules, with formal meetings, \ntelephone conferences as well as unplanned urgent issues that required their immediate involvement.  \nWhen informal meetings were included, the executives recognised that they moved between groups \nup to twenty five times a day.  Executives realised that they habitually continued to behave in a new \ngroup as they had in the last.  This insight helped to explain why movement from some groups to \nothers were successful, but the majority were not.  When an executive moves between groups, and \nthe leadership role required did not change, the new group usually performed well.  When, on \nreflection, an executive considered why a move to a new group was unsuccessful, it could usually be \nassociated with a failure to switch leadership roles to that most appropriate to the new group. \n \nThe dynamic nature of the change from one leadership role to another was recognised by the \nexecutives participating in the project.  During small group discussions the concept of \u201ctransitional \nfactors\u201d was developed.  Transitional factors are separate and distinct from the concept of leadership \nroles.  Leadership roles are defined in terms of the significance of key factors; transitional factors, \nby contrast, are defined by the changing relative significance of key factors as an executive switches \nfrom one leadership role to another.  The two combine, as a new leadership role may be regarded as \nthe old leadership role, plus the transitional factor that transforms one into the other.  Defining the \nswitch from one leadership role to another in terms of the changing relative importance of key \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 21 of 34 \nfactors was found to help executives focus on the transitional experience of switching leadership \nroles. \n \nWith four separate leadership roles, it is possible to switch from any one of the four to any of \nthe remaining three leadership roles.  As such each leadership role has three transitional factors \nassociated with switching to the remaining three leadership roles.  With four leadership roles and \nthree transitional factors per leadership role, this indicates that a total of twelve transitional factors \nmay be defined to \u201ctransform\u201d any of the four leadership roles into any of the remaining three \nleadership roles.  Once membership of a new group is established, the transitional factor effectively \nceases to exist, as the previous leadership role has now been \u201ctransformed\u201d into a new, different, \nleadership role.  What now exists is the new leadership role.   \n \nLeadership Roles \u2013 A Framework. \nThe authors recognised that in order to characterise the twelve transitional factors, it was \nnecessary to establish the changing relative importance of the key factors associated with each \ntransitional factor.  Before the changing relative importance of key factors could be established, \nhowever, the authors recognised that it was first necessary to actually establish the importance of \nkey factors when associated with each of the leadership roles.  The authors conceptualised the eight \nkey factors and four leadership roles as an eight by four matrix comprising thirty-two \"links\".  This \nmatrix was named the \"leadership role model\", Figure One, as it comprised an executive\u2019s mental \nmap of those key factors that are important to each leadership role. \n \nTake in Figure One. \n \nWhilst all thirty-two links are theoretically relevant, it was recognised that in practice some \nwould be relatively more important than others.  The data classification exercise demonstrates this, \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 22 of 34 \nTable Two, with for example the link between the key factor communication and the leadership role \nsocial having 110 batches of data associated with it, whilst the link between the key factor \ninfrastructure and the leadership role task being associated with only six batches of data.  From this \nthe authors concluded that the key factor communication was very significant to the leadership role \nsocial, whist the key factor infrastructure was of little relevance to the leadership role task. \n \nTake in Table Two. \n \nThe data in Table Two has been presented on the leadership role model graphically.  The \ncase for graphical representation was made by Huff & Jenkins (2002) who conclude that graphical \nmodelling naturally lends itself to developing conceptualisations that are both complete and \nsystematic.  The data for each link was divided into four categories: \n \n\u2022 Category One:  0-30 batches of data assigned to the link. \n \n\u2022 Category Two:  31-60 batches of data assigned to the link. \n \n\u2022 Category Three:  61-90 batches of data assigned to the link. \n \n\u2022 Category Four:  91-120 batches of data assigned to the link. \n \nThis model\u2019s thirty-two \u201clinks\u201d each have \u201cheight\u201d that is proportional to the link\u2019s \nsignificance, Figure Two.  A Category Four link, for example, is taller than a Category One, Two or \nThree link.  The concept is simple; you are more likely to stumble over taller objects! \n \nTake in Figure Two. \n \nThe most striking feature of the model is that there are major features associated with each \nleadership role, and with each key factor.  The leadership roles have all been demonstrated to be \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 23 of 34 \nsignificant in that they all had data assigned to them in at least one key factor, Table Three.  The \nlevel of granularity associated with the leadership roles is also considered to have been shown to be \nappropriate.  Of the four leadership roles defined, none was found to be significant to every key \nfactor, and all were significant to at least one key factor. \n \nTake In Table Three. \n \nDynamically Characterising Transitional Factors \nThe dynamic nature of transitional factors can be illustrated by considering the switch from \nthe macro to the legitimate leadership role.  The leadership role model characterises the key factor \ngroup dynamics, for example, as being a category one link when associated with the macro, and \ncategory four link when associated with the legitimate leadership role.  The difference between the \ntwo, when switching away from macro to legitimate leadership roles, is a positive increase in \nsignificance of three from a category one to a category four link.  A consideration of the difference \nbetween the significance of the eight key factors when switching from the macro to legitimate \nleadership role enables these differences to be tabulated, Table Four, to help make immediately \napparent the nature of the dynamic change occurring as a consequence of the switch.  When the \n\u201cmacro to legitimate\u201d transitional factor is viewed in this tabular form (the \u201cdifference\u201d column in \nTable Four), it is clear that the key factor group dynamics has increased in significance most, and \nthe key factors infrastructure and clearly defined goals have reduced in significance the most. \n \nTake in Table Four. \n \nThe decrease in significance of the key factor clearly defined goals can result in executives \nfocusing primarily on defining the new group\u2019s goals.  A focus on defining goals, when it is the role \nof other group members, will result in new group members perceiving behaviour to be inappropriate.  \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 24 of 34 \nThe switch sees the key factor group dynamics increasing most, indicating that a conscious effort to \nseparate the process of group life from the content of group discussion is necessary.  The leadership \nrole model may be interpreted in a similar way for all twelve transitional factors (Sheard & \nKakabadse, 2005).  What remains constant throughout the interpretation process is that: \n \n\u2022 The complex nature of the network of formal, informal and temporary \ngroups that make up an organisation\u2019s wider senior management team can \nresult in an individual executive switching leadership roles many times in a \nsingle day. \n \n\u2022 An awareness that as an executive moves from one group to another, the \nbehaviour that was appropriate is no longer necessarily so. \n \n\u2022 A failure to adapt behaviour to that appropriate in a new group can provoke \nconflict resulting in an increasing probability of very inappropriate \nbehaviour. \n \n \nImplications For Managers. \nThe twelve transitional factors are each associated with a different switch, with different key \nfactors increasing (Table Five) and decreasing (Table Six) in relative importance.  Presenting \ntransitional factors in this way (Table Five & Six) was found to help executives understand how to \nadapt to their new leadership role as they moved from one group to another.  Firstly, it was found by \nexecutives to be relatively easy to associate individuals within a group with one of the four \nleadership roles.  Secondly, it was relatively easy for executives to follow their own switch from one \nleadership role to another.  A focus on the appropriate transitional factor enabled executives to see \nthe changing relative importance of two or three key factors that enabled one leadership role to be \ntransformed into another.  By mapping the transitional experience of switching leadership roles in \nthis way, those involved found the process of switching role became much easier.  Defining the \ntransitional experience of switching leadership roles in terms of transitional factors in turn resulted \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 25 of 34 \nin executives actually starting to switch roles in practice, as opposed to just talking about switching \nroles. \n \nTake In Table Five & Six. \n \nAs the executives involved became familiar with the process of switching leadership roles, \nthree practical lessons concerning role transition were identified:  \n \n\u2022 The process of switching leadership roles starts with consciously analysing \nthe members of a new group, associating existing group members with a \nleadership role and then choosing a complementary leadership role to adopt. \n \n\u2022 Switching role is facilitated by an awareness of the transitional factor \nassociated with the transition from an old to new leadership role. \n \n\u2022 The changing importance of two or three key factors associated with a \ntransitional factor provides an executive with specific guidance of how their \nfocus should change in order for their contribution to a new group to be \nperceived as positive by existing group members. \n \n \nTaken together, it is the focus on leadership roles and transitional factors that constitute the \nprocess by which an executive adapts behaviour to that most appropriate, given the leadership roles \nother executives occupy in a new situation.  An awareness of the transitional factor which will \nconvert a previous leadership role to a new one is the sensitivity to context required of executives as \nthey move between formal, informal and temporary groups within an organisation\u2019s wider senior \nmanagement team. \n \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 26 of 34 \nConcluding Comments. \nThe concept of transitional factors, transforming one leadership role into another, \nacknowledges the degree to which the formal mechanism for task accomplishment is intertwined \nwith a senior management team\u2019s internal role system.  The process of familiarising executives with \nleadership roles available to them, and the transitional factors that enable them to switch roles \nconstitutes a form of role analysis.  Role analysis is an intervention strategy, enabling individual \nexecutives to take action to solve those problems with which they, and the wider senior management \nteam of which they are a part, are faced. \n \nThe existence of informal and temporary small groups of executives within the wider senior \nmanagement team and larger formal group that is the senior management team presents executives \nwith a challenge.  The authors observed that those executives who were able to develop their ability \nto apply transitional factors, and in so doing adapt from one leadership role to another as they \nswitched groups made a more positive contribution to both the speed and quality of organisational \ndecision making.  The challenge for executives is to consider their behaviour in terms of role, \nspecifically the leadership role appropriate to their current situation and therefore by implication the \nchange in behaviour needed if this leadership role is different to that appropriate in their previous \nsituation. \n \nThe concepts advanced in this article provide an insight into the nature of leadership as a \nnetwork of relationships.  By recognising the roles of others and by becoming aware of the range of \nroles that are available to the self, executives learn to modify their behaviour to take account of the \nsituation.  This clarification of role boundaries helps to define the limits of authority and \nresponsibility amongst executives and facilitates resolution of internal group issues. \n \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 27 of 34 \nThe role theory developed in this article builds on the concept that roles are the basic element \nof a social system, specifically developing a role based perspective on leadership.  The authors \npropose that by considering leadership in terms of role, individual executives are able to adapt more \neffectively as their situation changes, and so better coordinate their behaviour with other executives.  \nThis in turn enables executives to contribute positively to the organisational decision-making \nprocess and wider senior management team interaction by being adaptive and responsive to change \nin their surrounding context, resulting in decisions both being made more quickly and more likely to \nbe implemented. \n \nThe need for further research into the nature of the four leadership roles is clear.  The \nconcepts advanced in this article, and the implications discussed provide an insight into the \ndistributed form of leadership, but does not comprise a distributed model of leadership.  A study of \nthe practical application of leadership roles is required to identify specifically how they are related, \nand more generally how they are applied in practice.  A limitation of the current study is its basis in \na one-organisation intensive case study.  To test their robustness, the concepts advanced require \nvalidating in organisations with significantly different cultures from that in which they were \ndeveloped.  It is hoped that the observations and emerging theoretical framework offered in this \narticle will stimulate debate and enthusiasm for more research. \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 28 of 34 \nReferences \nAdair, J.

The alternative would \nbe a prescriptive or tactical approach, in which the activities the group was to undertake were specified.  The process of \ndefining a group\u2019s goal is a strategic process, in which that which the group is to achieve is clearly defined, but the \nprocess by which it is achieved is left to the group. \nPriorities Within any organisation there are a wide range of options, many of which would be advantageous if pursued.  In practice, \ndue to the practical limitations of time, money and available resources an organisation must choose a small number of \noptions from those available, make them the organisational priority and pursue only those.  A very common failing of \norganisations is attempting to undertake too many projects, with the consequence that all are under-resourced.  The \nconcept of priority is therefore central to an organisation\u2019s ability to define those options that will maximise its \ncompetitive advantage, and then allocate resources to deliver them. \nRoles & \nResponsibilities \nFrom the perspective of the group each individual group member must have complementary roles and responsibilities \ncovering all that are relevant to delivering the group\u2019s goal.  Significant overlap between roles will result in conflict \nemerging between group members.  This is particularly true with regard to the group leader.  It must be clearly understood \nby all who the group leader is if conflict is not to escalate out of control.  Significant extension of roles beyond that strictly \nnecessary to deliver the group\u2019s primary goal will result in group members spending time on activities that are not \nrelevant to the group\u2019s primary purpose.  In so doing the ability of the group to perform is reduced. \nSelf Awareness Self-Awareness bundles together all of the psychology associated with the impact of individuals\u2019 behaviour on their \nimmediate surroundings.  Within this context it is considered important to recognise that the behaviour, both conscious \nand unconscious, of individuals, can have a profound impact on other group members, which in turn can either positively \nor negatively impact on a group\u2019s performance. \nGroup Dynamics It is recognised that a group is more than simply a collection of individuals working towards a common goal; it is also a \nsocial system.  The concept of \"Dual Task\" put forward by James (1999) requires that social structures are built within the \ngroup to generate the necessary social system the group needs to function.  Certainly on the day group members first meet \nthere is no social system.  Once performing, effective groups are clearly well ordered, supportive social systems in which \neach member has a place, which he is comfortable with.  The transformation of a loose group to an effective team may \nthen be viewed as the generation, and acceptance, of a new social system. \nCommunication The regular flow of information about the job, the task and how the group is undertaking it.  Too much information would \ndefeat the purpose, becoming noise and a burden.  Too little information and it is ignored, being replaced by speculation.  \nThe effective communication between individuals, up and down the organisational hierarchy, is a key factor in mobilising \na group around the organisational problem it is intended to address. \nContext Organisational culture was studied by Goffee and Jones (1996) who concluded that significant differences in culture did \nexist within organisations both horizontally in different parts of the organisation and vertically at different levels within it.  \nFrom a single group\u2019s micro perspective it was considered probable that at some points within the group development \nprocess the generic environmental context would impact on its ability to transform from a loose group to an effective \nteam. \nInfrastructure The key factor Infrastructure includes all macro organisation issues from IT systems and Human Resource support to the \nability of the senior management team to translate its strategy into a series of goals suitable for a series of teams to tackle.  \nIt is recognised that this is a very broad category, however executives recognised that after the skill and competence of \nemployees, the most important factor impacting on organisational performance was adequacy of the organisational \ninfrastructure. \n \nTable 1: Definitions of key factors, adapted from Sheard & Kakabadse (2002b). \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 32 of 34 \n \n  Leadership Roles \n  Macro Legitimate Task Social Total \nClearly Defined Goals 103 43 16 14 176 \nPriorities 43 15 68 16 142 \nRoles & Responsibilities 14 40 74 39 167 \nSelf Awareness 69 64 33 38 204 \nGroup Dynamics 15 95 14 72 196 \nCommunication 14 14 40 110 178 \nContext 12 74 15 15 116 \nInfrastructure 72 15 6 85 178 \nK\ney\n F\nac\nto\nrs\n \nTotal     1,357 \n \nTable 2: Data assigned to each leadership role associated with each key factor. \nMapping the Transitional Experience of Switching Leadership Team Roles, As Sent to Print \nPage 33 of 34 \n \n  Leadership Roles Sample Data \nC\nle\nar\nly\n D\nef\nin\ned\n \nG\noa\nls\n \nIn total one hundred and seventy six pieces \nof data were associated with the first key \nfactor, clearly defined goals, with macro \nemerging as the most significant leadership \nrole.
