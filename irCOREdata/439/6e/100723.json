Of particular focus is the question of the robustness of\nmagic numbers at N,Z = 28, 40, and 50, and the appearance\nof subshell closures at nucleon numbers 32 and 34 as a function\nof neutron\/proton number. Single-particle monopole energy\nshifts between specific orbitals can result in a rearrangement\nof the traditional ordering of subshells associated with near-\nspherical nuclei [1,2], which in turn results in the appearance\n(removal) of new (traditional) magic numbers. Recent reports\nfollowing initial studies with projectile fragmentation [3\u20135]\nand deep-inelastic reactions [6\u20139] have suggested a possible\nsubshell closure for neutron number N = 32 (and perhaps\nN = 34), associated with a large single-particle gap between\nthe neutron p 3\n2\nand p 1\n2\norbitals. It has been proposed that a\nweakening of the proton-neutron \u03c01f 7\n2\n\u2192 \u03bd1f 5\n2\ninteraction\nand a significant \u03bd2p 3\n2\n\u2192 \u03bd2p 1\n2\nspin-orbit splitting result in\nthe appearance of an N = 32 shell closure by lowering the\np-shell neutron orbitals in energy with respect to the f 5\n2\nstates.\nThe states are inverted compared to the traditional near-stable\nordering in which it is expected that the f 5\n2\nlies below the p 3\n2\nand p 1\n2\n, respectively.\nMonopole-energy shifts can be inferred from direct mea-\nsurement of single-particle energies in odd-A nuclei or,\nalternatively, by identifying configuration-specific decays in\nthe spectral sequences at higher spins [10]. This short article\nis intended to investigate the proton energy levels above the\nZ = 28 shell closure for N \u223c 50.\nThe nuclei of interest were populated following heavy-ion,\nmultinucleon transfer reactions with a thick target [8,9,11,12].\nThe beam of 82Se ions of energy 460 MeV was provided\nby the tandem XTU and superconducting LINAC ALPI at\nthe Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro, Italy. The ions were\nincident on an isotopically enriched (97.8%) 192Os target of\nthickness 50 mg\/cm2 backed with a 0.2 mm layer of Ta, thick\nenough to stop all the reaction products. Reaction \u03b3 rays were\nmeasured using the GASP spectrometer [13] consisting of 40\nCompton-suppressed, coaxial, hyperpure germanium detec-\ntors and an 80 element inner BGO ball for \u03b3 -ray multiplicity\nand calorimetry measurements. Events consisting of at least\n3 Compton-suppressed germaniums and 2 BGO elements\nwithin an event time of approximately 1 \u00b5s were written to\ntape for off-line analysis. The on-target beam current during\nthe experiment was approximately 2 pnA, which resulted in\na typical master-trigger rate of 4 kHz over the course of the\n6 day experiment. Further details and results of this experiment\nare presented in Refs. [11,12,14,15]. The data were sorted\ninto symmetric \u03b3 -ray energy coincidence cubes and analyzed\nusing standard software packages described in Ref. [16].\nExamples of double-gated \u03b3 -ray triples spectra from the cube\nanalysis are shown in Fig. 1. The \u03b3 -ray information on the\nosmium isotopes has been reported elsewhere [11], but we note\nagain here the high-spin population on the near-target nuclei in\nthe current work. Discrete states with angular momenta of 20h\u00af\nand higher were observed in even-A 186\u2192194Os, highlighting\nthe effectiveness of multinucleon transfer reactions for the\npopulation of near-yrast states in near-stable nuclei.\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(5)\/054317(5) 054317-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nG.

Spectra in parts\n(b)\u2192(d) illustrate double-gated \u03b3 -ray gates on transitions (shown in\nparentheses) in 80,82Se from the current work.\nThe decay schemes associated with 80,82Se deduced from\nthe current work are shown in Fig. 2. States up to spin 8h\u00af have\nalso been reported previously in the N = 48 isotone 82Se,\nfollowing deep-inelastic reactions [17,18], with a nanosecond\nisomer associated with the (\u03bdg 9\n2\n)\u22122, I \u03c0 = 8+ seniority con-\nfiguration at Ex = 3519 keV. Such two-neutron-hole seniority\nisomers are a standard feature throughout the N = 48 isotonic\nchain [17,18]. Three \u03b3 rays of energy 1940, 231, and 442 keV\nwere observed to decay from states above the Ex =\n3519 keV level in 82Se. Further transitions of energies 1038,\n664, 622, 580, 419, and 339 keV have been observed in\n80Se. The ordering of transitions identified in 80,82Se was\ninferred from \u03b3 -ray intensity measurements. The thickness\nof the arrows in Fig. 2 indicates \u03b3 ray intensities measured\nfrom double-gated spectra. Notably, the 1940 keV \u03b3 ray feeds\ndirectly to the yrast I\u03c0 = 8+ state.\nWhere possible, spin and parity assignments were made\nby comparison with previous studies of these nuclides using\nCoulomb excitation, \u03b2\u2212 decay, and inelastic neutron scattering\n[19,20]. The statistics in the current work precluded the use\nof \u03b3 -\u03b3 correlation analysis for further multipole assignments;\nhowever the prompt timing conditions used in the off-line\nanalysis limit likely electromagnetic decays to E1,M1, E2,\nand possibly M2 character.

The\nstrengths of the two-body interactions for protons are fixed\nto reproduce the experimental energy levels of the singly\nclosed-shell nucleus 84Se. The strengths of the two-body\ninteractions for neutrons and that between neutrons and\nprotons are adjusted to reproduce the excitation energies of the\nlow-lying states for 80,82Se and neighboring even-even nuclei.\nThe detailed framework of the model is presented in Ref. [24].\nThe adopted strengths of the interactions are as follows\n(in MeV): G0\u03bd = 0.200,G2\u03bd = 0.070, \u03ba\u03bd = 0.240,G0\u03c0 =\n0.260,G2\u03c0 = 0.006, \u03ba\u03c0 = 0.090, \u03ba\u03bd\u03c0 = \u22120.200.\nIn Fig. 3 the predicted energy levels are compared with\nthe experimental data determined for the nuclei in the current\nwork. In general, the shell-model calculations reproduce the\nexperimental levels rather well. The shell model predicts that\nhigh spin yrast states (I \u0001 10) appear high in excitation energy\n(>4 MeV). The large energy gap predicted between the yrast\n10+ and 8+ levels in 82Se can be understood simply by the\nincrease in valence space required to allow states of this high\nangular momentum. It should also be noted that the shell model\nreproduces the energy gap between the first 6+ and 8+ states in\n82Se. For a better reproduction of the 8+1 state, a hexadecapole\npairing interaction might be necessary.\n0\n2\n4\n6\nexpt.

(Color online) Expectation numbers of pairs in the PTSM\nwave functions for 80Se and 82Se.\nTo better understand the structure of the low-lying states, we\ncarried out a pair-truncated shell-model (PTSM) calculation\n[25] using the same effective interactions as those used in the\nshell-model calculations. The basis wave function is written\nas\n|\b(I )\u3009 = [\u2223\u2223Sn\u00afs\u03bd Dn\u00afd\u03bd Gn\u00afg\u03bd H n\u00afh\u03bd\n\u232a\u2297 \u2223\u2223Sns\u03c0 Dnd\u03c0 Gng\u03c0\n\u232a](I )\n, (2)\nwhere S,D, and G are the collective pairs with angular\nmomenta 0, 2, and 4, respectively. The H\u03bd is the noncollective\npair, which is made of two neutrons in the g 9\n2\norbital coupled\nto angular momentum K (K = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8). Except for the\nK = 0 pair, twice the expectation number of H\u03bd pairs gives\nthe seniority in the g 9\n2\norbital.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the PTSM results for 80Se and 82Se\nin comparison with the experimental data and shell-model\ncalculations. It can be seen from the figure that the model\nspace spanned by the PTSM is adequate to reproduce the\nshell-model results for both nuclei. The agreement up to spin\n8+ is very good, as one might expect for a structure dominated\nby the neutron (g 9\n2\n)\u22122 seniority configurations coupled with\nthe proton quadrupole collective excitations. The energy gap\nbetween the I\u03c0 = 6+1 and 8+1 states is explained by the\n\u201cbackbending phenomena.\u201d Two neutrons in the g 9\n2\norbital\nalign to have the maximum angular momentum 8 when the\ntotal spin changes from 6 to 8.

The large energy gap between the I\u03c0 = 8+1\nand 10+1 states in 82Se is mainly associated with having to\nallow excitation of two protons from, e.g., f 5\n2\nto p 3\n2\n, which\nis indicated by an increase in the number of D\u03c0 pairs for the\nI\u03c0 = 10+1 state compared to the 8+1 level in 82Se. We note\nspecifically that the number of H\u03bd (K = 8) pairs increases\nfrom zero to one from spin 6 \u2192 8. This indicates that the\ntwo neutrons in the g 9\n2\norbital align to have maximum angular\nmomentum 8.\nIn Table II we show the expectation numbers of the S,D,G,\nand H pairs calculated in the PTSM for 82Se. For the 8+1 state,\nthe alignment of neutrons in the orbital g 9\n2\ndominates to give\nthe configuration (g 9\n2\n)\u22122. This state is predicted to have very\nsmall collective excitations, evident from the calculated expec-\ntation number of D\u03c0 pairs, which reduces from 1.59 (6+1 state)\nto 0.42 (8+1 state). It is more energetically favorable for the two\nneutrons to align to spin 8, rather than forming the same spin\n(8h\u00af) by a quadrupole excitation. For the 8+2 state, it is seen that\nthe contribution of the collective excitation is larger. The wave\nfunction of the 8+1 state and that of the 10\n+\n1 state are very similar\nexcept that the latter includes a quadrupole excitation. This\npartly explains the large energy gap between these two states.\nIn summary, \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy of near-yrast states in\nN \u223c 50 selenium isotopes were studied using deep-inelastic\nreactions. The level schemes deduced from this work were\ncompared with restricted-basis shell-model calculations and\npair-truncated shell-model calculations. States in 80,82Se were\ninterpreted in terms of the alignment of g 9\n2\nneutrons and proton\nexcitations from the f 5\n2\nsubshell to the p 3\n2\nor p 1\n2\norbital.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sci-\nences Research Council (UK), EU Contracts ERBFMGECT\n980110 and HPRI-CT-1999-00083, and a Marie Curie grant\nof the European Community Program IHP under Contract\nHPMF-CT-2002-02018.\n[1] B.
