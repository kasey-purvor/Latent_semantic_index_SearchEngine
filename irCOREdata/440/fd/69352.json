Magnetospheric physics (Magnetospheric con-\nfiguration and dynamics; Solar wind-magnetosphere interac-\ntions; Storms and substorms)\n1 Introduction\nSubstorms represent one of the fundamental modes of\nglobal energy circulation and magnetic flux transport in the\ngeospace environment (Cowley et al., 2003). Although on\naverage the quantity of magnetic flux opened via dayside\nreconnection must be balanced by flux closure (occurring\nCorrespondence to: J. A. Wild\n(j.wild@lancaster.ac.uk)\npredominantly in the magnetotail), there is no requirement\nfor the instantaneous flux opening and closure rates to be\nmatched. Thus, in general, the balance between the day-\nside and nightside reconnection rates determines the amount\nof open magnetic flux within the magnetosphere (e.g. Lock-\nwood and Morley, 2004). Following dayside reconnection,\nonly a fraction of the flux transported into the tail is re-\nconnected and convected back toward the dayside (Rostoker\net al., 1987). The remaining flux is added to the tail lobes\ncausing the magnetic flux density in the tail to increase. This\nstored energy is eventually released in an explosive fashion\nand the magnetosphere undergoes rapid reconfiguration. The\nprocesses of gradual energy storage followed by sudden re-\nlease are usually referred to as the substorm growth and ex-\npansion phase, respectively.\nSubstorms therefore represent the explosive reconfigura-\ntion of the magnetosphere resulting from the release of solar\nwind energy and momentum stored in the Earth\u2019s magnetic\ntail. At the onset of the substorm expansion phase, an in-\nstability prompts the rapid reconfiguration of the magneto-\ntail resulting in highly dynamic aurora and enhanced iono-\nspheric currents. Since Akasofu first introduced the concept\nof substorms over 40 years ago (Akasofu, 1964), the mech-\nanism and timing of the instability that leads to the rapid\nand large-scale reconfiguration of the Earth\u2019s magnetotail has\nbeen actively debated. Four decades of ground- and space-\nbased observations have led to the development of several\nmodels that rely upon different physical mechanisms to ex-\nplain the sequence of cause and effect in the magnetosphere\nthat result in the closure of open magnetic flux by reconnec-\ntion in the tail and the auroral disturbances observed in the\nmidnight sector auroral zones. The launch of NASA\u2019s Time\nHistory of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Sub-\nstorms mission (THEMIS: Angelopoulos, 2008) in February\n2007, has renewed scientific focus on the uncertainty in the\nlocation and timing of substorm expansion phase onset in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic tail. Recent results from the mission (which\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3560 J. A. Wild et al.: On the triggering of auroral substorms\ncomprises five identically instrumented probes with orbits ar-\nranged such that during key observing seasons the spacecraft\nalign radially every four days in order to measure the timing\nand evolution of the signatures of substorm onset) are dra-\nmatically advancing our understanding of the timing and lo-\ncation of substorm expansion phase onset (e.g. Angelopoulos\net al., 2008).\nAnother key uncertainty is the possible triggering of sub-\nstorm expansion phase onset by factors external to the mag-\nnetospheric cavity (rather than the spontaneous growth of\na plasma instability in the magnetotail current sheet). In a\nstudy of upstream interplanetary conditions during \u223c1800\nsubstorms, Caan et al. (1978) reported that the average\nBZ component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nreached a negative peak approximately ten minutes prior\nto expansion phase onsets determined from ground magne-\ntometer data. These findings led Caan and co-workers to\nspeculate that northward turnings of the IMF may act as an\nonset trigger mechanism. Lyons et al. (1997) examined in\nsitu solar wind and IMF measurements during substorm on-\nsets and concluded that northward turnings of the IMF were\nresponsible for triggering 13 of the 20 events studied. Lyons\net al. (1997) went on to suggest that a large majority of sub-\nstorms are triggered by the IMF, although the physical mech-\nanisms linking the IMF structures to the growth of a mag-\nnetotail instability remain unclear. Subsequently, Hsu and\nMcPherron (2002) searched for evidence of IMF triggers in\n3 months of IMF data from the ISEE-2 spacecraft. Hsu and\nMcPherron (2002) employed the same criteria as Lyons et al.\n(1997) in order to define a substorm trigger at time t in a\nset of measurements of the north-south component BZ of the\nIMF sampled at discrete times ti . Assuming time resolution\n1t=ti+1\u2212ti=60 s in the solar wind measurements, these cri-\nteria are as follows:\n1. The IMF must be southward for at least 22 of the pre-\nceding 30 min:\n#{BZ(t \u2212 301t : t) < 0} \u2265 22 (1)\nwhereX(a:b) denotes all elements ofX(xi) in the range\na<xi\u2264b and #{X} indicates the number of elements in\nthe set X.\n2. The turning initiation must be rapid, so that:\nBZ(t +1t)\u2212 BZ(t)\n1t\n\u2265 0.375 nT min\u22121 (2)\n3. The northward turning must be sustained, determined\nby the slope of the linear regression of \u2207BZ on ti be-\ntween t and t+10 min:\nBZ(t : t + 101t)\n101t\n\u2265 0.175 nT min\u22121 (3)\nand BZ must be increasing so as to satisfy the\nrequirements BZ(t+1t :t+31t)\u2265BZ(t)+0.175 nT and\nBZ(t+31t :t+101t)\u2265BZ(t)+0.45 nT.\n4. No other point in the previous 10 min should satisfy the\nlisted criteria. That is, once a trigger is identified, any\nturnings satisfying the criteria in the following 10 min\ninterval are ignored.\nUsing the above criteria Hsu and McPherron (2002) exam-\nined 61 731 1-min resolution data points from the ISEE-2\nspacecraft while in the vicinity of 12:00 MLT and just up-\nstream of the bow shock in September 1978 and September\u2013\nOctober 1979. Within these data, 598 possible substorm trig-\ngers were identified, while ground magnetometer measure-\nments were employed to identify 258 substorm onsets within\nthe same time range. The statistical association between trig-\ngers and onsets was then evaluated using the statistics of\npoint processes, with the time delay between substorm on-\nsets and the propagated arrival time of IMF triggers found\nto be clustered around zero. These results were interpreted\nas evidence that the association between northward turning\ntriggers and substorm onsets is statistically significant at a\nconfidence level so high that there is little possibility that the\nassociation is a result of chance.\nHowever, in a re-analysis of the Hsu and McPherron\n(2002) dataset, Morley and Freeman (2007) demonstrated\nthat the time delay between substorm onsets and the propa-\ngated arrival time of IMF triggers were also clustered around\nzero when only the first of the Lyons criteria listed above was\nemployed. Morley and Freeman interpreted this result as ev-\nidence that given a period of southward IMF (corresponding\nto the substorm growth phase), northward IMF turning trig-\ngers (as described by criteria 2\u20134 of Lyons et al., 1997) were\nnot required for a substorm expansion phase onset to occur.\nMovement toward a resolution of the substorm triggering\nquestions is often hampered by uncertainty in the configura-\ntion of the IMF and solar wind parameters controlling solar\nwind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Frequently, solar\nwind and IMF data recorded at the Sun-Earth L1 libration\npoint are propagated Earthward in order to estimate the con-\nditions impinging upon the magnetopause. However, signif-\nicant errors can arise in the time delay estimation required\nto lag L1 data to the magnetosphere, making the one-to-\none association of IMF drivers with magnetospheric effects\nsomewhat unreliable (e.g. Weimer et al., 2002). For example,\nmeasurements from the ACE spacecraft (Stone et al., 1998)\nare often employed. However, the \u223c150 000 km (\u223c23RE)\nsemi-major axis of ACE\u2019s halo orbit about the L1 libration\npoint implies that solar wind streamlines passing though the\nACE spacecraft are unlikely to directly intersect the magne-\ntopause. Therefore, in this study (as in the studies presented\nby Hsu and McPherron, 2002, and Morley and Freeman,\n2007), we shall employ magnetic field and plasma data from\na few RE sunward of the bow shock in order to minimise un-\ncertainties in the propagation of upstream measurements to\nthe magnetosphere for a large group of substorms. However,\nin contrast to Hsu and McPherron (2002) and Morley and\nFreeman (2007), we shall examine the upstream solar wind\nAnn.

By exploiting a different substorm onset\nidentification method and comparing onset timings with solar\nwind and IMF measurements from the region just upstream\nof the bow shock, the results of the present investigation can\nbe directly compared to the previous studies.\n2 Data analysis\nUpstream solar wind and IMF data for this study are taken\nfrom the European Space Agency\u2019s Cluster satellite mission\n(Escoubet et al., 1997, 2001). The quartet of Cluster space-\ncraft were launched in the summer of 2000 and orbit the\nEarth in highly elliptical polar orbits (19RE apogee\/4RE\nperigee) with periods of \u223c57 h. The orbits are fixed in in-\nertial space such that the orbital plane precesses through 24 h\nof local time in 12 months. Between approximately January\nand April each year, this orbit configuration takes the space-\ncraft upstream of the bow shock as they pass through apogee.\nMeasurements of the local magnetic field and plasma ion\npopulation at each Cluster spacecraft are provided by the\nfluxgate magnetometer (FGM; see Balogh et al., 1997, 2001)\nand the Cluster ion spectrometry (CIS; see Re`me et al.,\n1997, 2001) experiments, respectively. After rejecting in-\ntervals during which there were more than 10 missing\/bad\ndata points in a given hour of spin-resolution (\u223c4 s) mea-\nsurements, three component magnetic field data, ion density\nand ion velocity measurements have been averaged at 1-min\nresolution (as was the case in Lyons et al., 1997, and Hsu and\nMcPherron, 2002).\nIn order to examine the relationship between upstream\nIMF conditions and substorm onsets, we require a list of\ncandidate events. Frey et al. (2004) analysed auroral obser-\nvations made by the IMAGE FUV instrument between May\n2000 and December 2002, identifying 2437 individual sub-\nstorms. Substorms were identified if they fulfilled the fol-\nlowing criteria: (1) a clear local brightening of the aurora\nhas to occur, (2) the aurora has to expand to the poleward\nboundary of the auroral oval and spread azimuthally in local\ntime for at least 20 min, (3) a substorm onset was only ac-\ncepted as a separate event if at least 30 min had passed after\nthe previous onset. The resulting list of events, subsequently\nextended to December 2005 to include a total of 4193 sub-\nstorms (Frey, 2006), forms the basis of the present study. Of\nthese events, we have identified 301 substorms that occurred\nwhen the Cluster 1 spacecraft was located upstream of the\nbow shock and making magnetic field and plasma measure-\nments. After excluding candidate events that contained data\ngaps during two-hour intervals starting 90 min prior to the\nonsets listed by Frey and co-workers, the list of substorms\nto be examined is reduced to 260 individual events spanning\nthe period 3 February 2001 to 1 May 2005. Figure 1 presents\na summary of the locations of the Cluster 1 satellite during\nthe 260 substorms examined in this study and investigated to\nidentify possible IMF triggers.\nFigure 2 presents upstream data during three example sub-\nstorm onsets selected from the 260 events in our dataset. For\neach substorm onset, the location of the Cluster 1 spacecraft\nis compared to the model bow shock position as described by\nRoelof and Sibeck (1993). The model is parameterised ac-\ncording to average solar wind and IMF conditions observed\nby Cluster over a 2-h interval starting 90 min prior to on-\nset. Based upon the position of the model bowshock, a solar\nwind propagation time (TSW ) in the anti-sunward direction\nfrom the location of the spacecraft to the bowshock is cal-\nculated (typically <1 min). It is also necessary to take into\naccount the propagation time of potential IMF trigger signals\nacross the magnetosheath (TSH ) and along magnetospheric\nfield lines toward the Earth and magnetotail (TMS). The total\npropagation delay of IMF triggers (T ) is therefore estimated\nto be T=TSW+TSH+TMS . In keeping with the analysis of\nHsu and McPherron (2002), TSH and TMS are assumed to\nhave fixed values of 4 min and 2 min, respectively. The total\npropagation \u201clags\u201d computed for each of the examples pre-\nsented in Fig. 2 are shown in the right-hand frames. IMF BZ\nand solar wind dynamic pressure data are then lagged such\nthat the presented time series correspond to the estimated ar-\nrival times of these structures in the magnetotail relative to\nthe observed substorm onset time.\nThe uppermost pair of panels in Fig. 2 correspond to\nthe substorm onset identified by Frey et al. (2004) at\n07:50:43 UT on 8 February 2003. Following a southward\nturning \u223c50 min prior to substorm onset, the BZ compo-\nnent of the IMF remained negative for the remainder of the\ninterval while solar wind dynamic pressure was generally\nsteady at \u223c3 nPa throughout. Times at which the first of the\nfour Lyons triggering criteria (negative BZ for 22 out of the\npreceding 30 min) is satisfied are indicated by yellow back-\nground shading (starting 44 min prior to onset). However,\nat no time during the interval presented were all four Lyons\ncriteria satisfied.\nThe centre pair of panels in Fig. 2 correspond to the sub-\nstorm onset at 17:26:28 UT on 18 March 2001. In this case,\nthe IMF was generally southward in the 90 min preceding\nsubstorm onset. We note that the first Lyons criterion is satis-\nfied from t\u221261 min to t+12 min while all four Lyons trigger-\ning criteria were satisfied 3 min after the onset time observed\nby IMAGE (t+3 min).\nThe final example presented in Fig. 2 (lower pair), corre-\nsponds to the onset at 10:21:32 UT on 2 February 2005. In\nthis interval, the BZ component is variable, with several turn-\nings of the IMF toward a more northward orientation. The\nfirst Lyons criterion is satisfied from t\u221261 min to t+2 min\nwhile all four Lyons triggering criteria were satisfied 3 min\nbefore the onset time observed by IMAGE (t\u22123 min). Al-\nthough not considered by the Lyons triggering criteria, we\nnote that at the time of the trigger there is also a modest\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3559\/2009\/ Ann.

The right-hand panel shows the\ndistribution of events as a function of \u03c1.\n(\u223c50%) and step-like increase in the solar wind dynamic\npressure.\nTo summarise, according to the northward turning IMF\ntrigger definition criteria used by Lyons et al. (1997) and\nHsu and McPherron (2002), two of the three example events\npresented in Fig. 2 exhibit IMF triggers within a \u00b110 min\nwindow centred on substorm onset (the window length used\nin the previous studies) while a third onset occurred without\nan accompanying IMF trigger. In the following section, we\npresent the result of a study including all 260 events outlined\nabove.\n3 Results\nFigure 3 presents an overview of the substorm triggering sig-\nnatures observed in this study. For comparison, the same ba-\nsic analysis has been repeated twice, once searching for IMF\ntriggers that fulfil all four of the criteria set out by Lyons\nand co-workers (Fig. 3a) and once again looking for those\ntimes when only the first (southward IMF) criterion is satis-\nfied (Fig. 3b). Beginning with Fig. 3a, the uppermost panel\nshows the distribution of triggers (satisfying all four of the\nLyons criteria) observed within one minute wide bins over a\n\u00b110 min interval centred on substorm onset during all 260\nonsets included in this study. For example, within the par-\nent group of 260 onsets, Lyons type triggers were observed\nin the \u221210 min bin (i.e. within \u221210 to \u22129 min range) in two\nsubstorms. Likewise, Lyons type triggers were observed in\nthe \u22121 min bin during five of the 260 onsets studied.\nThe lower three panels of Fig. 3a present equivalent dis-\ntributions of Lyons triggers where, in each panel, the parent\ngroup of 260 substorm onsets is subdivided according to up-\nstream solar wind and geomagnetic conditions. These data\nare presented in order to examine possible solar wind and\ngeomagnetic factors that might influence the effectiveness of\npossible solar wind triggers. Specifically, these panels break\ndown the Lyons type onsets into:\n\u2013 Storm and non-storm time intervals (storm time inter-\nvals being defined at those with a Dst index less than\n\u221240 nT)\n\u2013 Intervals of fast and slow speed solar wind flow (fast\nintervals being defined as those where the average solar\nwind speed exceeded 450 km\/s)\n\u2013 Intervals with and without a solar wind dynamic pres-\nsure enhancement at the time of substorm onset (an en-\nhancement being defined as a >50% increase in dy-\nnamic pressure in the 20 min averaged window centred\non substorm onset, compared to the preceding 20 min\naverage)\nAlthough the number of triggers in each bin is small, there is\nlittle evidence of a peak in the occurrence of Lyons-type trig-\ngers (satisfying all four criteria outlined above) in the few\nminutes either side of substorm onset. This is true of the\nparent dataset, as well as those subdivided according to so-\nlar wind and geomagnetic conditions. However, it is worth-\nwhile noting that the majority of the observed triggers oc-\ncurred during non-storm intervals with no evidence of solar\nAnn.

The number of instances\nin each bin is significantly higher than in Fig. 3a (more than\nan order of magnitude) since the fourth Lyons criterion, spec-\nifying a 10 min period after each trigger during which sub-\nsequent triggers are ignored, is not included. However, the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3559\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3559\u20133570, 2009\n3564 J. A. Wild et al.: On the triggering of auroral substorms\nFig. 3. The occurrence of substorm triggers within \u00b110 min of substorm onset based upon (a) all four Lyons et al. (1997) criteria and\n(b) triggers satisfying only the first (southward IMF) criterion. In both cases, the panels present (from top to bottom) the occurrence within\nthe parent distribution of all substorm onsets; occurrence during storm and non-storm intervals; occurrence during intervals of fast and slow\nsolar wind; occurrence during intervals with changes in solar wind dynamic pressure (as described in the text).\ndistribution of instances where the southward IMF criterion\nis satisfied is broadly uniform across the \u00b110 min period ei-\nther side of the observed substorm onsets, regardless of solar\nwind and geomagnetic conditions. The sizeable increase in\nthe fraction of onsets associated with extended intervals of\nsouthward IMF (Lyons criterion 1) compared to northward-\nturning IMF triggers (Lyons criteria 1\u20134), regardless of asso-\nciation window, suggests that southward IMF is a more sig-\nnificant factor in the development of a substorm expansion\nphase onset.\nFigure 4 presents a superposed epoch analysis of upstream\nIMF BZ measurements for all 260 onsets included in this\nstudy. Specifically, Fig. 4a presents the variation in the me-\ndian IMF BZ (lagged to the Earth) spanning the two hour\ninterval starting 90 min prior to substorm onset while Fig. 4b\npresents the variation in the mean IMF BZ (also lagged to\nthe Earth) spanning a longer eight hour interval, centred on\nsubstorm onset (equivalent to Fig. 4 of Caan et al. (1978)).\nThese data indicate that the onsets are typically preceded by\n\u223c1 h of southward IMF, with the maximum southward IMF\noccurring \u223c10\u201320 min prior to zero epoch time.\nIn their statistical analysis of 258 substorms onsets, Hsu\nand McPherron (2002) reported that \u223c10 min was the opti-\nmal half-width of the association window between substorm\nonsets and triggering signatures observed in the solar wind\n(when time-lagged as above). Therefore, in Fig. 5 we present\nthe number of substorms where an IMF trigger was observed,\nfor varying window sizes. In the case of northward turning\nIMF triggers (as defined by Lyons criteria 1\u20134) between 14\nand 61 of the 260 substorms examined were associated with\nan IMF trigger in association windows ranging from \u00b11 to\n\u00b110 min of substorm onset, respectively. When the defini-\ntion was relaxed to include only the southward IMF criterion\n(Lyons criterion 1), the number of substorms associated with\nIMF control increased to between 146 and 183 events for as-\nsociation windows ranging from \u00b11 to \u00b110 min of substorm\nonset, respectively.\n4 Discussion\nFor the 260 substorm onsets examined in this study, the IMF\npropagation time from the Cluster 1 spacecraft to Earth, in-\ncluding the magnetosheath and magnetospheric transit times\nemployed by Lyons et al. (1997), Hsu and McPherron (2002)\nand Morley and Freeman (2007), varied between between 6\u2013\n8 min. Given that these propagation delays (and their ex-\npected uncertainties) are comparable to the \u00b110 min win-\ndow employed by previous studies in order to associate\ntrigger signatures with substorm onsets, we would expect\nany systematic IMF triggering effect to be clearly apparent.\nAnn.

(a) Median IMF BZ values (black trace) spanning the two\nhour interval starting 90 min prior to substorm onset for the 260\nevents included in this study. The range of values defined by the up-\nper and lower quartiles is indicated by the shaded region. (b) Mean\nIMFBZ values spanning the eight hour interval centred on substorm\nonset for the 260 events included in this study.\nAlthough broadly split between intervals of fast and slow\nsolar wind speed, the vast majority of the substorm onsets\nincluded in this study occurred during non-storm times and\nwere not associated with step-like increases in solar wind dy-\nnamic pressure (as indicated in Fig. 3).\nThe analysis summarised in Fig. 5 indicates that\nnorthward-turning IMF triggers satisfying Lyons criteria 1\u2013\n4 are associated with less than a quarter of the substorms\nexamined, even when a \u00b110 min association window is em-\nployed. If the association window size is reduced to \u00b14 min\n(comparable to the typical estimated Cluster-Earth propaga-\ntion time of \u223c7 min), the number of substorms associated\nwith northward-turning IMF triggers falls to under 12%. This\nrelation between the fraction of substorms associated with\nnorthward-turning IMF triggers and the length of the associ-\nation window is confirmed by the broadly uniform distribu-\ntion of triggers relative to substorm onset (Fig. 3a).\nIf the upstream IMF conditions are relaxed to only include\nthe first Lyons criterion, then the \u201ctriggering\u201d is simply an\nindication of >22 min of southward IMF in the preceding\n30 min, i.e. a simple definition of the southward IMF con-\nditions that might be expected during the substorm growth\nphase. As indicated in Fig. 3b, this simple southward IMF\ngrowth phase criterion is satisfied with almost uniform prob-\nability at various times in the \u00b110 min window either side of\nsubstorm onset. When comparing the fraction of onsets asso-\nciated with this growth phase criteria, the percentage grows\nfrom 56% for a\u00b11 min association window to over 70% for a\n\u00b110 min window. Although the fraction of onsets satisfying\nthe growth phase criterion is much greater then those satisfy-\ning all four Lyons criteria (regardless of association window\nsize), a significant fraction of onsets remain unaccounted for.\nWe suggest that this is an indication that the first Lyons crite-\nrion fails to adequately describe the substorm growth phase.\nFor example, evidence suggests that open flux continues to\nbe added to the terrestrial magnetosphere via dayside recon-\nnection even under positive IMF BZ conditions as long as\nthe IMF clock angle, defined as arctan(BY \/BZ), exceeds 45\u25e6\n(Sandholt et al., 1998). We note that if the growth phase cri-\nterion is redefined to find times when the modulus of the IMF\nclock angle was greater than 45\u25e6 for at least 22 of the preced-\ning 30 min, the percentage of onsets satisfying the criterion\nincrease to between 89%\u201393% for 1\u201310 min association win-\ndows, respectively (as shown in Fig. 5).\nThe high likelihood of a period of southward IMF prior\nto the onsets included in this study is further highlighted in\nFig. 4. The median upstreamBZ values (Fig. 4a) indicate that\nthe IMF is typically southward during the hour prior to sub-\nstorm onset (i.e. during the expected substorm growth phase).\nWhen considered over a longer time interval, the mean up-\nstream BZ values (Fig. 4b) are similar to the upstream IMF\nconditions presented during separated substorms by Caan\net al. (1978). The IMF component is small and slightly pos-\nitive four hours prior to onset before turning southward for\nthe majority of the intervals presented, reaching a maximum\nnegative of \u22121.58 nT twenty minutes prior to substorm on-\nset (compared of a maximum negative of around \u22122.25 nT\nabout twenty minutes prior to substorm onset reported by\nCaan et al. (1978)). Apart from brief southward excursions at\nt\u2212170 and t\u221271 min, the mean IMF BZ only becomes neg-\native 60 min prior to substorm onset. This is somewhat dif-\nferent to the trend shown by Caan et al. (1978), who reported\nthat the mean IMF for separated substorms turned southward\n\u223c150 min prior to onset. However, in both cases, the ampli-\ntude of the IMF BZ component (regardless of sign) is found\nto be less than one third of the maximum amplitude until\nabout one hour prior to zero epoch.\nBased on Fig. 4, there is an obvious tendency for the IMF\nto be southward prior to substorm onset and then to turn\nnorthward around the time of zero epoch. Indeed, this has\npreviously been cited as evidence for the triggering of sub-\nstorms by northward turnings of the IMF (e.g. Samson and\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3559\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3559\u20133570, 2009\n3566 J. A. Wild et al.: On the triggering of auroral substorms\nFig. 5. Variations in the number of substorms associated with IMF\ntriggers as a function of association window length. The number\nof substorms with at least one trigger within the indicated window\nlength is presented for both northward IMF triggers (according to\nLyons criteria 1\u20134), southward IMF triggers (Lyons criterion 1 only)\nand the IMF clock angle criterion introduced in the text (more than\n22 min of IMF clock angle magnitude greater than 45\u25e6 in the pre-\nceding 30 min).\nYeung, 1986). However, since substorm onsets are biased to\noccur during intervals of southward IMF and the long-term\ndistribution of IMF BZ values has a mode of 0 nT, it is rea-\nsonable to expect that from a highly negative point on the\nIMF BZ distribution changes will, on average, tend towards\nzero (i.e. in the positive direction). Therefore, although con-\nsistent with the data of Caan et al. (1978), we cannot interpret\nthe results presented in Fig. 4 as evidence of a causal link be-\ntween northward turnings of the IMF and substorm onsets.\nIn order to examine any possible causal link more\nrigourously, an analyses of trigger signatures has been un-\ndertaken based on the statistics of point processes (e.g. Cox,\n1955; Brillinger, 1976). This test has previously been ap-\nplied to substorm onsets and their candidate triggers by Hsu\nand McPherron (2002) and Morley and Freeman (2007). The\nreader is directed to these papers for a comprehensive de-\nscription of the technique but, as described in Morley and\nFreeman (2007), the association between two point processes\nis assessed using the association number, calculated as fol-\nlows. Given two point process (i.e. time series of discrete\nevents) A and B, with events at times ai (i\u2208 {1, 2, ... N}) and\nbj+u (j\u2208 {1, 2, ... M}), respectively, where u is a time lag.\nThe individual association number ci is the number of events\nin series B that fall into a window of half-width h around ai\nand the association number n(u, h) is the summation of ci\nover all events ai\nn(u, h) =\nN\u2211\ni=1\nci =\nN\u2211\ni=1\n#\n{\u2223\u2223bj + u\u2212 ai\u2223\u2223 < h} (4)\nwhere # {X} denotes the number of elements in the set X.\nFor independent processes, the association number is well-\nestimated by the asymptotic association number n(u\u2192\u221e, h)\nsince separating any two time series by sufficient time will\nensure independence between the points in the two series.\nTherefore, if there is no association between point processes\nA and B for any lag u, there will be no significant departure\nfrom its asymptotic value at any lag. Alternatively, if there is\nan association between point processesA andB, a significant\ndeparture from the asymptotic level is expected at some lag.\nIn the case of the IMF BZ triggering hypothesis, we would\nexpect the departure from the asymptotic level at a lag rel-\natively close to zero. A bootstrapping technique (Conover,\n1999) is employed in order to evaluate the sampling varia-\ntion in n(u, h) and establish the 95% confidence limits for\nthe sampling variation (after Morley and Freeman, 2007).\nFigure 6 presents the association number analysis of candi-\ndate IMF \u201ctriggers\u201d within a window of \u00b1h of observed on-\nset times, as a function of lag u. For this analysis, the window\nwas set to a half-width of h=10 min in order to give results\ncomparable with Hsu and McPherron (2002) and Morley and\nFreeman (2007). In the first instance we assess the associa-\ntion between northward turning IMF triggers as defined by\nLyons criteria 1\u20134 applied to Cluster 1 magnetic field data\nwhenever the spacecraft was located within the solar wind\nbetween February 2001 and December 2005. For compari-\nson, all 3494 substorm onset timings identified in Frey et al.\n(2004) over the same period are compared. By doing so, we\ninclude all triggers observed when Cluster was in the solar\nwind (regardless of whether or not an onset was observed)\nand all onsets observed by IMAGE (whether or not upstream\nIMF data were available). Figure 6a shows the association\nnumber between these point processes as a function of lag\nu, summed over all onset times. In order to aid the compar-\nison between this and subsequent panels, the left-hand axis\nis normalised to the relevant asymptotic association number,\nwhile the actual association number are marked on the right-\nhand axis. In all, we have N=3494 onsets and M=1323 trig-\ngers. At lags of |u|>200 min the association number tends\nto a mean asymptotic association number of 39.

In all, we have N=3494\nonsets and M=133 429 instances where the clock angle cri-\nterion is met. At lags of |u|>200 min the association number\ntends to a mean asymptotic association number of 3840. The\npeak in normalised association is n(u, h)=1.26 (with 95%\nconfidence limits of 1.11\u20131.42) at u=\u221210 min. The lower\nconfidence interval is above the asymptotic association num-\nber for \u221242<u<10 min.\nConsidering the analysis presented in each panel of Fig. 6,\nif the association between substorm onsets and the relevant\nIMF criterion is no greater than that expected by chance,\nthen the association number should be similar at all lags.\nHowever, this is not the case here. In each panel of Fig. 6,\nthere are significant deviations from the expected associa-\ntion under independence. As such, the results indicate that\n(a) northward IMF triggers, as defined by Lyons criteria 1\u20134,\n(b) intervals of southward IMF, as defined by Lyons crite-\nria 1 and (c) intervals of IMF with clock angle magnitude\n>45\u25e6 are all associated with substorm onsets. The maximi-\nsation of association at lags just prior to onset is due to the\nneed to propagate the solar wind such that the measured flux\nis added into the magnetospheric lobe. Examining Fig. 6b,\nthe 95% confidence limits of the Lyons criteria 1\u20134 criteria\n(indicated by the red shaded region) encompass both the cal-\nculated association number for Lyons criterion 1 and a sig-\nnificant fraction of the confidence limits for Lyons criterion\n(indicated by the blue traces). Indeed, the confidence limits\non the estimate of the association number for Lyons crite-\nria 1\u20134 overlaps the calculated association number for Lyons\ncriterion 1 and \u223c70% of the confidence interval around it.\nThis substantial overlap suggests that the primary factor in\nthe association of \u201dtriggers\u201d with onsets (described by Lyons\ncriteria 1\u20134) is the inclusion of the southward IMF criterion\n(Lyons criterion 1). The results are similar to those of Mor-\nley and Freeman (2007), despite being based upon upstream\nIMF data from different spacecraft and relying upon very dif-\nferent onset identification techniques.\nThe association of onsets with clock angle (Fig. 6c) is sta-\ntistically significant, but the substantially lower normalised\nassociation number indicates that it is a worse predictor of\nonset than either of the other two criteria. On first inspec-\ntion, this seems at odds with results above showing the high\npercentage of onsets following >22 min of IMF clock an-\ngle magnitude >45\u25e6 in the preceding 30 min (as indicated in\nFig. 5). However, given that the association number analysis\nis applied to more substorm onsets, the results indicate that\nthe clock angle criterion is fulfilled for a large number of non-\nsubstorm intervals. In other words, while large numbers of\nonsets are preceded by more than 22 min of IMF with a clock\nangle larger than 45\u25e6 (either positive or negative) within a\nhalf hour period, many such periods of this IMF orientation\nare not followed by a substorm.\nOur analysis therefore suggests that even though the clock\nangle criterion fits a large fraction of events, it is too broad\na descriptor and further study is required to better under-\nstand both the necessary and sufficient conditions for onset.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3559\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3559\u20133570, 2009\n3568 J. A. Wild et al.: On the triggering of auroral substorms\nCombined with the distribution of the temporal distribution\nof triggers before and after onset (as indicated in Fig. 3),\nwe interpret the results of this study as evidence that north-\nward turnings of the IMF are not required to trigger substorm\nonsets and conclude that the association between northward\nturnings and substorm onsets arises from the fact that north-\nward turnings are biased to occur under southward IMF, as\nreported in Morley and Freeman (2007).\n5 Summary and conclusions\nIn this study we have analysed upstream solar wind measure-\nments during 260 substorm onsets in order to investigate the\nsignificance of northward-turning IMF triggers, of the kind\nproposed by Lyons et al. (1997). The substorm onset times\nare derived from IMAGE FUV observations of the UV aurora\n(as described by Frey et al., 2004) and are based upon a clear\nlocal brightening of the aurora, the poleward and azimuthal\nexpansion of the auroral oval and 30 min temporal separa-\ntion from the previous onset. In this respect, the substorms\nstudied are similar to the \u201cclassical\u201d substorms defined by\nLyons et al. (1997). Simultaneous solar wind and IMF mea-\nsurements are drawn from the Cluster 1 satellite in the region\nimmediately upstream (<5RE) of the bowshock and within\n17RE of the Earth-Sun line. By exploiting such near-Earth\nmeasurements, the propagation time (and associated errors)\nof observed IMF structures to the Earth is minimised.\nBased upon a case-by-case examination of these sub-\nstorm onsets, we suggest that there is no requirement for\na northward-turning IMF trigger of the kind proposed by\nLyons et al. (1997), to initiate expansion phase onset. If,\nfor example, we consider the northward-turning IMF trigger\nsignatures observed with \u00b110 min of substorm onsets \u2013 an\nassociation window more than twice the length of the typ-\nical upstream propagation delay from Cluster to the Earth\n\u2013 less than a quarter of the onsets studied indicate any evi-\ndence of triggering. Conversely, greater than 70% of the ob-\nserved onsets occur following an interval of southward IMF\ncharacterised by >22 min in the preceding half-hour. The\noverarching trend, with only a minority of substorm onsets\nbeing associated with a northward-turning IMF trigger, ap-\npears unaffected by the prevailing solar wind speed and ge-\nomagnetic storm activity. Of the 260 onsets studies, only a\nhandful were associated with solar wind dynamic pressure\npulses. As such, there is insufficient statistical evidence to\ncomment upon possible onset triggers due to changes solar\nwind dynamic pressure.\nThe majority of substorms studied follow an interval of\nsouthward IMF satisfying the first of the four Lyons criteria\nused to define northward-turning IMF triggers. Indeed, the\naverage IMF conditions during the substorm growth phase\nand onset are very similar to those reported by Caan et al.\n(1978). However, the number of onsets observed that failed\nto satisfy the first Lyons criterion (approximately 30% of\nthose studied) suggests that the southward IMF growth phase\ndescription encapsulated by >22 min of negative BZ in the\npreceding half-hour does not fully describe the IMF drivers\ncorresponding to the substorm growth phase. A modified\ngrowth phase criterion, based upon the IMF clock angle in-\nstead of the north-south component of the IMF alone, is\nfound to account for over 90% of the onsets included in our\ncase-by-case investigation.\nAn analysis based upon the statistics of point processes has\nbeen used to investigate the association between substorm\nonsets and both northward IMF triggers (Lyons criteria 1\u20134)\nand southward IMF intervals (Lyons criterion 1). In both\ncases, the associations are statistically significant (>95%\nconfidence), suggesting that the primary factor in the asso-\nciation of \u201ctriggers\u201d with onsets is the inclusion of the south-\nward IMF criterion. The same analysis suggested that al-\nthough a statistically significant association existed between\nthe proposed clock angle criterion and substorm onsets, the\ncriterion is too broad to reliably predict the timing of sub-\nstorm onsets from upstream IMF measurements.\nIn summary, our findings relate to earlier studies as fol-\nlows:\n\u2013 The average observed IMF BZ component was south-\nward in the hour prior to substorm onset, reaching\na maximum negative amplitude approximately 20 min\nprior to substorm onset. This result is consistent with\nthat of Caan et al. (1978). In both studies, the amplitude\nof the IMF BZ component (regardless of sign) is found\nto be less than one third of the maximum amplitude un-\ntil about one hour prior to zero epoch. Since substorm\nonsets are biased to occur during intervals of southward\nIMF, it is reasonable to expect that from a highly nega-\ntive point on the IMF BZ distribution changes will, on\naverage, tend in the positive direction. Therefore, we do\nnot interpret the results of the current study as evidence\nof a causal link between northward turnings of the IMF\nand substorm onsets.\n\u2013 In a case-by-case analysis of the events included in our\nstudy, we find a number of substorms that follow north-\nward IMF triggers as defined by Lyons et al. (1997).\nHowever, these \u201ctriggered\u201d onsets account for less than\na quarter of the onsets observed. The evidence pre-\nsented here is therefore inconsistent with the conclusion\nof Lyons et al. (1997) that \u201ca large majority of classical\nsubstorms are triggered by the IMF\u201d.\n\u2013 Studies by Hsu and McPherron (2002) and Morley and\nFreeman (2007) have both exploited the statistics of\npoint processes in order to study the significance of any\nassociation between the northward-turning IMF triggers\ndescribed by Lyons et al. (1997) and substorm onsets.\nIn Hsu and McPherron (2002), a significant statisti-\ncal association was demonstrated, but the Morley and\nFreeman (2007) study, re-analysing the same dataset,\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 3559\u20133570, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3559\/2009\/\nJ. A. Wild et al.: On the triggering of auroral substorms 3569\nshowed that the same association was still present when\nonly a subset of the triggering criteria were used, specif-\nically the requirement for>22 min of negativeBZ in the\nhalf-hour preceding substorm onset. Using an entirely\nindependent database of upstream IMF data and onset\ntimings, the results of an identical analysis in the current\nstudy suggest that the primary factor in the association\nof \u201ctriggers\u201d with onsets is the inclusion of the south-\nward IMF criterion, consistent with the conclusions of\nMorley and Freeman (2007).\nThe results of the current study indicate that northward-\nturning IMF triggers are not required for expansion phase on-\nset, even if such features are sometimes observed at the time\nof onset. We therefore conclude that the association between\nnorthward turnings and substorm onsets arises from the fact\nthat northward turnings are biased to occur under southward\nIMF.\nAcknowledgements.
