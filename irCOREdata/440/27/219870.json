Key findings suggest that reasons for (dis)engagement with the \nInternet or the uptake of different kinds of online learning opportunities are somewhat varied for \ndifferent groups but that both digital choice and exclusion play a role. Thus it is important for \npolicy initiatives to better understand these groups and treat them differently. Furthermore, the \nmore informal the learning activity, the more factors that play a significant role in explaining \nuptake. Policies designed to support individuals\u2019 everyday interests as opposed to more formal \nkinds of learning are likely to be more effective in increasing people\u2019s productive engagement \nwith online learning opportunities.  \n \nKeywords: adult learning, e-learning, informal learning, lifelong learning, Internet use, digital \nchoice, digital exclusion  \n \n 3 \nIntroduction  \nThe importance of lifelong learning for the economy, society and the individual is well \nrecognised. Lifelong learning is believed to lead to a more competitive and adaptable workforce \n(e.g. DfEE, 1998) and can also result in other positive psychological, health and social capital \noutcomes (e.g. Feinstein et al., 2003; Hammond, 2004). However, in many countries \nparticipation rates in adult learning are relatively low and are unequal amongst different groups: \nthose who are better educated and better off are far more likely to participate in and benefit from \nlifelong learning opportunities than those who left school with few or no qualifications and have \nlower incomes (OECD, 2003).  \n \nThe use of the Internet and other new technologies has often been put forward as a potential \nsolution to address this problem by providing relatively flexible and cost-effective access to \nlearning opportunities. However, such initiatives have been criticised for being overly optimistic \nand technologically deterministic (Robins and Webster, 2002) and have often had limited \npractical success, due to a range of complex factors where social exclusion is key (Selwyn et al., \n2001). \n \nThe UK context provides a good example of this phenomenon. Like many other countries, the \nUK has relatively low participation rates in adult and lifelong learning. While 39% of adults have \nundertaken some kind of learning activity in the past three years, only 18% are currently learning \n(Tuckett and Aldridge, 2009). Furthermore, non-participation in adult and lifelong learning is \ndeeply entrenched with \u2018trajectories\u2019 based on class, gender, generation, ethnicity and geography \nand are established at an early age (Selwyn et al., 2006; Tuckett and Aldridge, 2009). Over the \n 4 \npast decade there has been a significant policy commitment to the potential of new technologies \nto support lifelong learning (e.g. DfEE, 1998; DIUS, 2009). However, in contrast to policy \nexpectations, access to the Internet and other new technologies has not increased the number of \nadults engaging in significant learning opportunities (Barraket, 2004; Selwyn et al., 2006). Nor \nhas it widened participation, as Gorard and Selwyn state, \u2018at best ICT is increasing levels of \nparticipation within the social groups that were learning anyway\u2019 (2005: p. 85).  \n \nSo why is this case? The reasons are multifaceted and relate to issues of both involuntary \nexclusion and choice. For example, some individuals may simply not have access to a range of \nICTs and have therefore never used them; others see technology as largely irrelevant to their \ndaily lives (Gorard and Selwyn, 2005) which leads them to choose not to use them. On the other \nhand, individuals may lack the ability to use the Internet effectively (e.g. in using particular \ntools, locating information etc), or they may have low confidence and self-esteem as learners \n(e.g. due to negative past experiences of learning) (Kirby et al., 2002; LSC, 2006; Makai et al., \n2001) which suggests a complex set of choice and exclusion reasons for disengagement.  \n \nIt is important to continue to explore if and why adults are using the Internet to support lifelong \nlearning; particularly given the lack of research in this area (Cook and Light, 2006) and the \nincreasing domestication of the Internet. As Internet penetration in the home increases in the UK \n(Dutton, et al., 2009; Helsper and Galacz, 2009) there may be changes in patterns of participation \nin the uptake of online learning opportunities. Indeed, the increased availability of the Internet in \nthe home may be particularly important for certain groups. For example, adults who wish to \nlearn but do not want to engage in formal education or those who have mobility\/health issues. \n 5 \nWe are not suggesting that the Internet and other new technologies can simply overcome the \ncomplex array of individual and contextual barriers to learning - technology does not in itself \nmake people more likely to participate (Gorard et al., 2002). Yet we argue it can facilitate \nexisting predispositions to finding out new things even amongst those who do not wish to engage \nwith traditional formal learning environments.  \n \n In this paper, using data from the 2007 Oxford Internet Surveys (OxIS) , we examine the uptake \nof online learning opportunities with a particular focus on the extent to which adults are using the \nInternet for learning activities because they choose to or because of (involuntary) digital \nexclusion. Our main question is: What constitutes choice in relation to online learning? How can \nwe measure it and how can we disentangle it, if at all, from digital exclusion (or forced choice)? \nThese are particularly challenging questions due to the difficulty of defining and understanding \n\u2018choice\u2019. People who have Internet access in their home but do not use the Internet are arguably \nmore likely to not use the Internet based on an informed \u2018choice\u2019; that is, a decision not based on \nsocio-economic disadvantage but on personal preferences and needs. For those who have no \naccess and do not use the Internet this \u2018choice\u2019 could be tied up with socio\u2013economic factors and \n\/ or life circumstances. Nevertheless, the uptake of traditional offline learning opportunities is \noften related to a complex mix of societal, household and individual characteristics and \nassociated processes of socialisation which form people\u2019s choices (Lucey and Walkerdine, 2000; \nLucey, et al., 2003). There is no reason to assume that the relationship between choices and \nexclusion as regards newer forms of online learning will be easier to disentangle. \n \n 6 \nAs noted above, discussions around digital exclusion and choice are not only related to uptake of \nonline learning opportunities, it relates to broader questions of digital exclusion and inclusion. In \nthe literature, disengagement with new technologies is typically explained as the result of \n(involuntary) exclusion or as the result of choice. In simple, dichotomous terms, the first argues \nthat socio-economic resources (income, education) limit people\u2019s possibilities to access \ntechnologies and their opportunities in relation to skills acquisition. This disengagement is \ninvoluntary and related to a lack of opportunities (Livingstone and Helsper, 2007). Proponents of \nthe second explanation point towards findings which show that even in societies or households \nwhere access to ICTs is readily available people still disengage (Dutton et al., 2009). In societies \nwhere the diffusion of the Internet has reached a saturation point, some researchers suggest that \nissues of choice or lifestyle become more important than issues of exclusion (Mancenelli, 2007). \nBased on these principles personal choice can be defined as \u2018select[ing] among media choices \nbased on how well each option helps them meet specific needs or goals\u2019 (Cho et al., 2003, p.48).  \n \nChoice is a difficult concept to separate from issues of digital and social inclusion, as \u2018choice\u2019 is \nclearly embedded within a social context which will shape these choices (Cody et al., 1999; \nHaddon, 2000; Helsper, in press; Loges and Jung, 2001). For example, gender studies have \npointed out that \u2018choice\u2019 is often determined by societal pressures to behave in a certain way in \nrelation to technologies and that the choice not to use a technology or to use it in a narrow way is \nthus an overt reflection of these forces (i.e. forced choice) (Rommes, 2002; Selwyn, 2007; \nWajcman, 2004). Furthermore, studies with the elderly show that they often do not consider the \nInternet a technology that is appropriate or relevant for people of their age group (Dutton et al., \n 7 \n2009; Selwyn, 2006). Lucey, Melody and Walkerdine (2003) have pointed to similar processes \nrelated to gender and class. \n \nResearch on digital exclusion and inclusion has shown that there are some people who are \nunexpectedly engaged in using the Internet (Helsper, 2008). That is, they use ICTs against the \nodds of someone with their background engaging with technologies in general. Thus, issues of \ndigital choice are pertinent. This could also be the case for learning online and if so, determining \nwho these people are, how they could be best supported, and if others could be similarly \nempowered is an important issue. The distinction between choice and digital exclusion and its \nrelationship to the uptake of learning opportunities online has important policy implications since \ninterventions designed to support uptake of online learning opportunities are necessarily different \ndepending on which explanation is most relevant. While digital choice and digital exclusion are \nstrongly related in practice, the debate around education and ICTs may benefit considerably from \ndisentangling their individual contributions to engagement with different types of learning \nopportunity.  \n \nThus, here we will explore the question of what constitutes choice in relation to online learning; \nand if and how we can measure it, understand it and disentangle it, from digital exclusion (or \nforced choice).  \n \nMethodology \nThe 2007 OxIS used a nationally representative sample of 2,350 people aged 14 and older in \nBritain (England, Scotland and Wales). Interviews were conducted face-to-face in people's \n 8 \nhomes. A two-stage random sampling design was used. First, a random sample of 175 areas in \nBritain was selected, stratified by region. Then, within each selected area, a random sample of 10 \naddresses was selected from the UK Postal Address File. The data were weighted according to \nthe UK Census based on gender, age, socio-economic grade, and region. The response rate using \nthis sampling strategy was 77%.   \n \nMeasures \nWe start our analysis by exploring the reasons why adults disengage from using the Internet \namongst those who do not currently use the Internet. Participants were asked \u2018Do you, yourself, \npersonally use the Internet at home, work, school, college or elsewhere or have you used the \nInternet anywhere in the past?\u2019 Response alternatives were: \u20181) yes, current user, 2) no, but used \nit in the past, 3) never used the Internet.\u2019 In this paper we use this question to distinguish \nbetween ex-users, those who have used the Internet before, and non-users, those who have never \nused the Internet. The second part of our analyses focuses on adult Internet users aged over 25 \nand the factors that explain their (dis)engagement from three types of online learning \nopportunities: informal learning, fact checking and formal learning activities.  \n \nFor both parts of the analyses we use regression analysis to examine the independent effect of a \nnumber of different factors that are important in understanding digital exclusion and digital \nchoice. These variables were selected based on previous work in this area related to adult \nlearning and use of ICTs (e.g. Selwyn et al., 2006), work that focuses on secondary digital \ndivides where issues of choice or lifestyle are seen as more important than issues of exclusion \n(e.g. Cody et al., 1999; Mancenelli, 2007) and consumer uptake studies and psychological choice \n 9 \ntheories (e.g. Cho et al, 2003; Choudrie and Dwivedi, 2004). The measures used as indicators in \nthis study were clearly limited to what was available in the survey, yet were sufficient to address \nthe research questions. \n \nFirstly, socio-economic status, level of education, home Internet access and Internet self -\nefficacy are included in these linear regressions to cover those factors associated with digital \nexclusion. Socio-economic status was created following the standard classification (A (highest) \nto E (lowest), M=3.51; SD=1.30) basing it on the occupation, education level and income level \nof the chief income earner. While there are many problems with SES as an indicator (Savage and \nBurrows, 2007), it was the best measure in OxIS of the socio-economic home environment \nwhich might shape engagement. Education (M=1.84; SD=.80) was created by classifying those \nwith up to secondary school education as \u2018Basic education\u2019 (1), those with additional post-\ncompulsory education as \u2018Further education\u2019 (2), and those with University education as \u2018Higher \neducation\u2019 (3).The analyses included other socio-demographic factors (such as age and gender) \nto cover socio-cultural factors that can be related to socialisation factors that shape digital \nchoice\n1\n. \n \nHome access was measured through the question \u2018Does this household have access to the \nInternet?\u2019 A dummy variable was created so that 1 signified \u2018Yes, current home access\u2019 and 0 \nsignified \u2018No current home access\u2019. (66% yes, c.i.= 65%-68%). Home access was chosen as an \nindicator of high quality access conducive to learning over access in more restricted public \nlocations (see Livingstone and Helsper, 2007; Mumtaz, 2001). Internet self-efficacy was \nmeasured on a five point scale from Excellent (5) to Bad (1) (M = 3.72, SD = .84) through the \n 10 \nanswer of the respondent to the question \u2018How would you rate your ability to use the Internet?\u2019 \nInternet self-efficacy was an operationalization of an exclusion factor since previous research has \nshowed a close link between this variable and traditional literacy and level of education (Eastin, \n2005). Although differences in self-efficacy could also be argued to be the result of socialization \nprocesses in relation to ICTs (Selwyn, 2007) this possibility is controlled for in the analysis. \n \nIn addition, attitudes towards ICTs and whether people have children (37%, c.i. = 35%-39%) \nwere included as indicators related to personal choice as regards the use of ICTs. Attitudes \ntowards ICTs was composed through averaging the agreement scores (from 1 \u2018disagree strongly\u2019 \nto 5 \u2018agree strongly\u2019) on ten related items (M=2.12, SD=.60), the construct had an acceptable \nlevel of internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s alpha, \u03b1 =.66). The ten items were: \u2018When new \ntechnologies or gadgets are invented, it is a good idea to try them\u2019, \u2018Technology is making things \nbetter for people like me\u2019, \u2018People should be able to express their opinion anonymously on the \nInternet\u2019, \u2018People who go on the Internet put their privacy at risk\u2019, \u2018The Internet makes life \neasier\u2019, \u2018The Internet is frustrating to work with\u2019, \u2018There is a too much immoral material on the \nInternet\u2019, \u2018The Internet is a fast and efficient means to gaining information\u2019, \u2018The Internet is a \nfast and efficient means to gaining information\u2019, and \u2018The use of the Internet can be addictive\u2019.  \n \nLearning takes many forms varying in the extent to which it is formal or informal, intentional or \nunintentional, and the level of time and engagement with a topic. Here, our focus is on the uptake \nof relatively minor or everyday online activities that may lead to learning. OxIS asks a number of \nquestions about the frequency with which people carry out different activities online (scale from \n1 \u2018never\u2019 to 6 \u2018several times per day\u2019) and, based on an exploratory factor analysis using varimax \n 11 \nrotation, twelve general categories of Internet uses were constructed including: fact checking, \ntraining or formal learning, informal learning, travel, finance, shopping, entertainment, social \nnetworking, e-government and civic participation (see Helsper and Galacz, 2009). The analyses \nin this paper will focus on fact checking (M=2.49, SD=1.19, r\n2\n=.68), formal learning (M=1.95, \nSD=.91, \u03b1=.72) and informal learning (M=2.44, SD=.97, \u03b1=.72) since, arguably these are the \nthree types of engagement of the twelve types identified that are most closely related to learning. \nFact checking was measured by taking the average of the two items, \u2018Finding or checking a fact\u2019 \nand \u2018Looking up a definition of a word\u2019. Formal learning consisted of the average score across \nthe following five items: \u2018Distance learning for an academic degree or job training\u2019, \u2019Finding out \nabout opportunities for further study about topics\u2019,\u2018 Getting information for work related \nprojects\u2019, \u2019School related projects or homework\u2019, and \u2018Looking for jobs, work\u2019. The informal \nlearning scale was the average of four items: \u2018Looking for news - local, national, international\u2019, \n\u2018Getting information about local events\u2019, \u2018Finding information about health or medical care\u2019, and \n\u2018Looking for sports information\u2019.   \n \nOf course, survey data cannot tell us about the extent of the learning that takes place while doing \nthese activities (if indeed learning takes place at all) but it enables us to explore the possible \nlearning opportunities for which adults may be using the Internet and a way to understand why \nadults engage or disengage from these activities. \n \nFindings \n 12 \nThis section is divided into two main parts. In the first, we explore why adults (dis)engage with \nthe Internet and in the second we examine why adult Internet users (dis)engage with online \nlearning opportunities. \n \n 13 \nWhy do adults disengage from using the Internet? \nOxIS asks non-users and ex-users about their reasons for not using the Internet. The items relate \nto four key reasons: costs, interest in using the Internet, skills and access. The percentage of ex-\nusers and non-users who agreed with each item is illustrated in Figure 1.  \n \nFigure 1: Reasons for disengaging from the Internet  \nReasons Ex-Users Stopped Using the Internet  Reasons Non-Users Do Not Use the Internet \n34\n35\n15\n38\n35\n14\n0 20 40 60 80100\nNo longer have a \ncomputer available\nMoved house\/job\nIt was too difficult to \nuse\nJust not interested\nToo expensive\nBecause I was spending \ntoo much time on it\nA\ncc\nes\ns\nS\nk\nil\nls\nIn\nte\nre\nst\nC\no\nst\ns\n \n74\n64\n77\n81\n52\n51\n0 20 40 60 80100\nHave no computer \navailable\nIt's too difficult to use\nDon't know how to use \na computer\nDo not yet know how to \nuse the Internet\nThere's nothing of \ninterest on the Internet\nIt's too expensive\nA\ncc\nes\ns\nS\nk\nil\nls\nIn\nte\nre\nst\nC\no\nst\ns\n \nBase. Ex- and Non-Users N=773 \n 14 \nAs can be seen in Figure 1, ex-users and non-users have different reasons for not using the \nInternet. Ex-users are most likely to point to a lack of interest and access. Non-users are most \nlikely to point to a lack of skill and access. Thus, to some extent it appears that ex-users are \nmaking a choice to disengage with the Internet (i.e. they lack interest) but factors of digital \nexclusion (i.e. access and costs) remain, whereas for non-users digital exclusion factors seem \nmore prominent.   \n \nTo obtain a more detailed picture and disentangle independent effects of choice and exclusion, a \nlogistic regression was conducted to understand how different factors are related to ex-users\u2019 and \nnon-users\u2019 disengagement from the Internet (Table 1). Dichotomous variables were created from \nthe items described in Figure 1, if the person marked at least one of the reasons within a class \n(i.e. access, skills, interest or cost) as a reason for why they did not use the Internet (non-users) \nor stopped using the Internet (ex-users) a score of \u20181\u2019 was assigned, if none of the reasons within \na class was indicated as a reason they received a score of \u20180\u2019 for that class. \n 15 \nTable 1 Logistic regressions of reasons for disengagement \n Lack of \u2026.

Ex- and Non-Users N=773 \n \nAs can be seen from Table 1 the reasons for disengagement are somewhat different for different \ngroups. Non-users who used the Internet before (i.e. ex-users), those with lower SES and those \nwith children are less likely to indicate that a lack of access is a reason for not using the Internet. \nInterestingly, ex-users, those with low educational levels (i.e. those with no higher education) are \nless likely to indicate that a lack of skills is a reason for not using the Internet. Those with more \npositive attitudes towards technology, ex-users and those who are younger are less likely to \nindicate that a lack of interest is a reason. Finally those with more positive attitudes, ex-users and \nolder people are less likely to indicate that cost is a reason. The only factor that did not play a \nrole in determining any reason for disengagement of the Internet was gender. This in contrast to \n 16 \nmany studies that find that amongst users self-perceived skill levels and interest in ICTs differs \nbetween men and women (Selwyn, 2006; Selwyn, 2007). \n \nAdult Internet users (dis)engagement from online learning opportunities \nIn this section we explore the factors related to disengagement from online learning opportunities \nby Internet users. Table 2 summarises the results of a linear regression of formal and informal \nonline learning for adults aged 25 and over. \n \nTable 2 Linear regressions of formal and informal online learning (adults older than 25) \n  Formal learning Fact checking Informal learning \n B Beta P B Beta p B Beta P \n(Constant) 0.91   0.82 0.84   * 0.74   ** \nHome access 0.00 0.00 0.97 0.19 0.04 0.19 0.46 0.11 ** \nAge -0.10 -0.15 ** -0.07 -0.08 ** -0.04 -0.06 * \nGender (female) -0.03 -0.02 0.53 -0.06 -0.02 0.40 -0.37 -0.19 ** \nSocial grade (SES) -0.03 -0.04 0.23 -0.04 -0.05 0.17 -0.02 -0.03 0.41 \nChildren under 10  -0.03 -0.02 0.39 -0.05 -0.03 0.28 -0.04 -0.03 0.29 \nChildren over 10  0.10 0.07 ** 0.04 0.02 0.43 0.10 0.07 * \nEducation 0.26 0.24 ** 0.18 0.12 ** 0.15 0.12 ** \nSelf-efficacy 0.23 0.23 ** 0.30 0.22 ** 0.28 0.24 ** \nAttitudes towards ICTs 0.07 0.04 0.17 0.20 0.09 ** 0.19 0.10 ** \nBase. Adult (older than 25yrs) Internet Users; N=1,281 \nNote. Non-linear relationships for age, social grade and education were tested but not found to be significant. \n \nAs can be seen in Table 2, the variables that relate to why adult Internet users engage or do not \nengage with online learning activities depend on which types of online learning are investigated. \n 17 \nThose Internet users who are more highly educated, with higher levels of Internet self-efficacy, \nhave children over 10 and are younger are more likely to use the Internet for formal learning. \nThose Internet users who have higher levels of Internet self-efficacy, have more positive \nattitudes towards ICTs, are better educated, and are younger are more likely to use the Internet \nfor fact checking. Internet users with home Internet access, men, have higher levels of \nconfidence in their Internet skills, have more positive attitudes towards ICTs, have children over \n10, are better educated, and younger Internet users are more likely to use the Internet for \ninformal learning. Perceived ability to use the Internet, level of education, and those who are \nyounger are significant factors across all three types of online learning opportunities. Having \nchildren over 10 is important for the uptake of formal and informal learning opportunities but not \nfor fact checking. Home access is important for more informal types of learning. \n \nThus, from these analyses it seems that digital choice and exclusion are both important, \nparticularly for more informal kinds of learning online. However, the approach above is \nproblematic due to the difficulty of adequately measuring \u2018choice\u2019. This is partly due to the \ncomplexity of the concept, but also the limited number of variables we have available to \noperationalise the construct (i.e. having children and positive attitudes towards technology). To \ntry to address this problem we next examined Internet users who are unexpectedly included or \nunexpectedly excluded from online learning opportunities based on a composite measure of \nsocial exclusion.  \n \nThe unexpectedly included and unexpectedly excluded \n 18 \nBased on education and SES we would expect certain individuals to be excluded from engaging \nwith the Internet in terms of learning, that is we would expect those with low education and low \nSES to be excluded from use while those with high education and high SES are expected to be \nincluded. This classification in terms of expected inclusion and exclusion allows a comparison of \nthose who do not \u2018comply with\u2019 these expectations to understand what makes them different. It is \ninformative to describe the unexpectedly included and unexpectedly excluded in terms of their \nsocialisation, choice and access characteristics to understand whether there are factors beyond \neconomic exclusion that explain engagement with the Internet for learning. Since there were high \nnumbers of Internet users who engaged with informal learning related activities at a basic level \n(i.e. carried out one online learning activity once every few months) we considered inclusion in \nrelation to these activities to be determined by a participation that was at least weekly. Thus, if \non average someone undertook formal learning activities at least weekly they were considered \nincluded in this particular area. In this instance, the analyses focus on the most extreme levels of \nsocial exclusion and not on those who are of average social exclusion levels (i.e. further \neducation and SES level C1C2). The examination of digital engagement focuses on very frequent \nuse of the Internet on purpose to understand what makes those who are most likely to be using \nthe Internet to learn different from those who are not. \n 19 \nTable 3 Percentages of (un)expectedly included and excluded Internet users \n  Socially Included\na\n Socially Excluded\nb\n \nFormal learning** \nLess than weekly  69% 97% \nAt least weekly  31% 3% \nFact checking** \nLess than weekly  38% 78% \nAt least weekly  62% 22% \nInformal learning** \nLess than weekly  50% 77% \nAt least weekly  50% 23% \nBase: Adult Internet Users with high social inclusion (N=198) or low social inclusion levels (N=144). \n** Differences between socially included and excluded significant at p<.01 \na.

SES level DE and Basic level of education (Secondary school) \n \nTable 3 shows that those who are socially excluded are significantly less likely to use the Internet \nat least weekly for all three learning purposes. These differences are larger for formal learning \nand fact checking than for informal learning. Informal learning is the area in which there are \nrespectively the largest proportion of unexpectedly included, 23% of Internet users who are \nsocially excluded carry out informal learning activities online at least weekly, and has the \nsmallest proportion of unexpectedly excluded, 50% of those who are socially included \nparticipate in online informal learning on a weekly basis. For formal learning and fact checking \nthe percentages of unexpectedly included are lower, 3% and 22% respectively, and the \npercentages of unexpectedly excluded are higher, 69% and 38% respectively. \n \nExtending this analysis, it is valuable to explore how those who are unexpectedly included (i.e. \nsocially excluded adult Internet users who take up online learning opportunities at least once a \n 20 \nweek) are different or the same as the expectedly excluded (i.e. socially excluded adult Internet \nusers who do not take up online learning opportunities at least once a week), the expectedly \nincluded (i.e. socially included adult Internet users who take up online learning opportunities at \nleast once a week) and the unexpectedly excluded (socially included adult Internet users who do \nnot take up online learning opportunities at least once a week).  \n 21 \n \nFigure 2 Descriptive indicators of (un)expectedly included and excluded Internet users \na) Access, Children and Gender \n42%\n35%\n95%\n46%\n33%\n94%\n50%\n36%\n95%\n42%\n38%\n97%\n39%\n37%\n96%\n33%\n35%\n96%\n51%\n45%\n87%\n46%\n39%\n85%\n55%\n43%\n85%\n51%\n47%\n100%\n72%\n70%\n96%\n38%\n54%\n97%\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nWomen\nChildren\nHome access*\nWomen*\nChildren**\nHome access*\nWomen**\nChildren\nHome access**\nF\no\nrm\nal\n l\nea\nrn\nin\ng\nF\nac\nt \nch\nec\nk\nin\ng\nIn\nfo\nrm\nal\n l\nea\nrn\nin\ng\n% of adult users\n \nb) Self-efficacy and Attitudes \n3.4\n4.1\n3.5\n4.0\n3.5\n4.1\n3.6\n4.2\n3.5\n4.3\n3.5\n4.3\n3.3\n3.2\n3.3\n3.1\n3.3\n3.1\n3.6\n3.3\n3.4\n3.6\n3.4\n3.4\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nAttitudes towards ICTs**\nSelf-efficacy**\nAttitudes towards ICTs*\nSelf-efficacy**\nAttitudes towards ICTs*\nSelf-efficacy**\nF\no\nrm\nal\n l\nea\nrn\nin\ng\nF\nac\nt \nch\nec\nk\nin\ng\nIn\nfo\nrm\nal\n l\nea\nrn\nin\ng\nDI\/SE\nDE\/SE\nDI\/SI\nDE\/SI\n \nBase: Adult Internet Users with high social inclusion (N=198) or low social inclusion levels (N=144). \n** Differences significant at p<.01 \n* Differences significant at p<.05 \nNote: \nDI\/ SE = unexpectedly included (digitally included\/ socially excluded)   \nDE\/ SE = expectedly excluded (digitally excluded\/ socially excluded)  \nDI\/ SI = expectedly included (digitally included\/ socially included)  \nDE\/ SI = unexpectedly excluded (digitally excluded\/ socially included)   \n \n 22 \nFigure 2a shows that those who are unexpectedly included have higher levels of home access for \nall three types of online learning opportunities and are significantly more likely to be female and \nhave children for fact checking than the other three groups. The differences between those who \ntake up online learning opportunities and those that do not are especially large within the group \nof socially excluded adult Internet users. For example, within the groups of socially excluded \nadults those who are using the Internet at least weekly for informal learning, fact checking and \nformal learning (i.e. the unexpectedly included) are at least 10 percentage points more likely to \nhave home access than those who use the Internet less than weekly for these activities (i.e. the \nexpectedly excluded). For fact checking the differences in access, children, gender, self-efficacy \nand attitudes are often larger than for the other learning activities, for example, 70% of the \nunexpectedly included have children in comparison to only 39% of the expectedly excluded in \nthe area of fact checking.  \n \nThe importance of gender is different for different types of learning. In the area of informal \nlearning the digitally excluded are less likely to be women no matter what their social inclusion \nlevel is. On the other hand, amongst the socially excluded those who engaged with fact checking \nare more likely to be women than those who did not engage in this activity, while amongst the \nsocially included this relationship is the reverse; those who are disengaged from fact checking \nonline are more likely to be women than those who are engaged with this activity. Within groups \nwith similar levels of social exclusion there are no gender differences between those who are \ndigitally included as regards formal learning and those who are excluded. \n \n 23 \nInterestingly, Figure 2b shows that those who are socially included are consistently more positive \nabout ICTs and have higher levels of self-efficacy independent of if and how they use the \nInternet for learning. Nevertheless, the differences between those who take up online learning \nopportunities and those that did not within groups with similar levels of social inclusion are \nsmall in relation to self-efficacy and ICT related attitudes. While small these differences are \nsignificant, those who take up online learning opportunities did have significantly more positive \nattitudes and higher levels of self-efficacy than those with similar levels of social inclusion who \ndo not take up those online learning opportunities.  \n \nDiscussion \nThe analysis above has demonstrated the complexity of debates around digital exclusion and \nchoice. Both choice and exclusion are important when exploring reasons why people (dis)engage \nwith online learning opportunities. Yet, the significance of choice and exclusion varies for \ndifferent groups of people and different types of learning.    \n \nWhen looking at the reasons non-users give for disengagement with the Internet (access, skills, \nlack of interest and cost) certain groups are more likely to give one or more of these reasons. For \nexample, ex-users of the Internet, those with lower SES and those with children are less likely to \nindicate that a lack of access is a reason for not using the Internet. Interestingly, the types of \nreasons typically associated with involuntary exclusion are closely related to the attitudes that \npeople have towards ICTs which in turn have been related to choice. This finding supports ideas \nof socialisation more than of agency since purely free choice or agency would mean people\u2019s \nindividual attitudes and opinions would be independent from class and other social factors. In \n 24 \nother words, it corresponds to what Lucey et al (2003) describe as the social psychological \nprocesses behind exclusion, where the choices people (can) make depend on their socio-cultural \nand family context. However, attitudes and a lack of interest also had independent effects in \nexplaining (dis)engagement with the Internet suggesting that individuals do have agency \nindependent of broader socio-cultural factors that determine their use of the Internet. That is, \npeople with negative opinions about ICTs are more likely to indicate they are not using the \nInternet due to costs or lack of interest independent of their socio-economic background.  \n \nIn addition, non-users are in general more likely to indicate cost, skills, interest and access as \nreasons for not using the Internet than ex-users. This indicates that individual non-users do not \nhave one specific reason for which they do not use the Internet, while individual ex-users are \nmore likely to have one particular reason but that what this reason is varies considerably from \none ex-user to the next. Indeed, these differences highlight the diversity amongst non-users and \nex-users that has been highlighted in, for example, the Pew Internet Studies (Rainie et al., 2003).   \n \nFrom the analyses here, both social exclusion and choice play a part in understanding non-use of \nthe Internet, but the significance of these factors may differ for different segments of the \npopulation. Thus, distinguishing different types of users and non-users and understanding how \nthey are different is important (Selwyn, 2006; Rainie et al., 2003).   \n \nSimilarly, digital exclusion and choice play complex roles in understanding (dis)engagement \nwith all three types of online learning opportunity. The linear regressions conducted enabled us \nto unpack what is going on in relation to exclusion (SES, education, self-efficacy and home \n 25 \naccess), socialisation (gender, age) and choice (attitudes towards ICTs and having children). \nWhen looking at the significant factors from the regression analyses, exclusion (education, self-\nefficacy), choice (having children) and socialisation (age) were all significant for formal \nlearning. For fact checking, exclusion (education and self-efficacy); choice (more positive ICT \nattitudes) and socialisation (being younger) were all significant. For informal learning, exclusion \n(education, self-efficacy, and home access); choice (ICT attitudes and having children) and \nsocialisation (gender and age) were significant. For uptake of more formal learning \nopportunities, the most important factors were those related to exclusion. For fact checking, the \nmost important factors were aspects of exclusion and choice; and for informal learning the most \nimportant factors are aspects of exclusion, socialisation and choice. Thus it seems that choice and \nexclusion are both important, particularly for more informal kinds of learning online, while for \nformal types of learning traditional exclusion variables tend to dominate.  \n \nThe OxIS items used to measure choice, socialisation and exclusion were limited. Therefore, the \nanalyses can only begin to demonstrate the complex interplay between individuals and their \nwork, home and social contexts. Nevertheless from the analyses it was possible to partly address \nsome of these issues by examining Internet users who were unexpectedly included or \nunexpectedly excluded from online learning opportunities. When looking at Internet users who \ncould be defined as socially included (that is, those who have SES level AB and university level \neducation) and comparing them to Internet users who could be defined as socially excluded (that \nis, those who have SES level DE and basic levels of education) there were significant differences \nin uptake of online learning opportunities by these groups. Those Internet users who were \nsocially excluded were significantly less likely to use the Internet at least weekly for all three \n 26 \nlearning purposes, particularly for formal learning and fact checking. In the case of informal \nlearning the picture was more positive as there was respectively the largest proportion of \nunexpectedly included. In addition, there was the narrowest gap between those who were \nunexpectedly included and those that were unexpectedly excluded. However, for fact checking, a \nvery specific type of everyday learning, these differences were the largest. \n \nWhile it is difficult to make a precise distinction between informal and formal learning (Sefton-\nGreen, 2004; Stern and Sommerlad, 1999) and our measures of formal and informal learning \nwere somewhat limited, this finding supports other work in this area that suggests that much of \nadult learning using ICTs tends to informal more than formal (Selwyn and Gorard, 2004) and \nthat policies designed to support people\u2019s interests as opposed to trying to make people \nundertake more formal kinds of learning would be more effective (Lynch, 2008; Selwyn et al., \n2006). Indeed, informal learning is a key consideration in these debates, as formal learning is \nonly a small part of people\u2019s overall learning experiences (Coffield, 2000). The Internet may be \none way that people can develop and learn more about their interests and, while the Internet \nshould not be the only option available to people it could be a valuable opportunity for some that \nneeds to be supported appropriately. Indeed, the potential of the Internet to be used in this way is \nrecognised by UK policy makers (e.g. DIUS, 2008).  \n \nFrom the analysis it is clear that amongst those who are socially excluded those who engage with \nlearning online have specific characteristics (having children, high levels of self-efficacy, and \npositive attitudes toward ICTs). These characteristics may have pushed this group of people to \novercome the disadvantages that made others disengage and take up learning opportunities \n 27 \nonline, particularly in the case of informal learning. Nevertheless, even though this group is \nusing the Internet for learning they may still need more support. While those who are \nunexpectedly included had more positive attitudes towards ICTs and higher levels of self-\nefficacy than those defined as socially excluded who did not take up those online learning \nopportunities, they were still more negative about ICTs and had lower levels of self-efficacy than \nthose who were socially included independent of how they used the Internet for learning. Thus, \nsimilar to our findings on users and non-users of the Internet it is important to understand the \nneeds of different groups of individuals and support them differently when appropriate.  \n \nConclusions \nFrom the analysis above it is clear that (dis)engagement with the Internet and the uptake of \nonline learning opportunities by adults is shaped by both digital exclusion and choice. While it is \ndifficult, if not impossible, to disentangle exclusion and choice, the research has shown it is \nvaluable to try to better understand these two concepts (and how they relate) to examine the \nreasons why people engage with the Internet, and, once online, if they engage with online \nlearning opportunities.  \n \nThe variables available for the analyses presented in this paper were limited, especially in \nrelation to indicators of choice. More research is required to understand the complex interplay \nbetween individual characteristics and decision making and the home, work and social contexts \nwithin which they operate. In addition, more research is required to better understand what \nchoice means in relation to Internet use and how Internet use is related to people\u2019s everyday lives \nand the learning they do off line. How and why people \u2018chose\u2019 to use the Internet for learning \ninstead of or to complement other ways of learning remains unclear.  \n 28 \n \nNotwithstanding these limitations, the distinction we were able to make between digital \nexclusion and choice furthers our understanding of what the difficulties might be in trying to \nsupport adults in taking up learning opportunities using the Internet. It is clear that different \ngroups are likely to need different kinds and levels of support if they wish to use the Internet for \nlearning. While it is difficult to unpack digital choice and exclusion, from this analysis we \nsuggest that examining Internet users who are unexpectedly included or unexpectedly excluded \nfrom online learning opportunities seems a particularly valuable approach for further research.  \n \nSimilar to other research, there seems to be greater uptake of informal kinds of online learning \nopportunities, and the more informal the nature of the online learning activity the more factors, \nbeyond involuntary exclusion, that become important. Thus, it appears that supporting informal \nlearning may well be the most effective course of action. Informal learning is an extremely \nimportant part of individuals learning experience and can have all kinds of social and, in some \ncases, economic benefits. Furthermore, increasing engagement in informal learning online could \npotentially awaken an interest in more formal, certified types of learning amongst those with \neducational disadvantages. However the relationships between formal and informal learning \nexperiences remains an under-researched area and more work is required to understand how \nthese processes work for a variety of different disadvantaged groups (Bell et al., 2009).  \n \nThe analyses do show that supporting online learning opportunities is not straightforward. \nProviding access and creating awareness about the benefits of ICTs are likely to make a \nsignificant step towards engaging people in learning but this is not sufficient to deal with issues \n 29 \nembedded in educational and social inequality. Particularly for more formal learning, which is \nless popular, socialisation factors and entrenched social inequalities will need to be tackled \nbefore participation in these activities is likely to increase.  \n \nIn summary, our analyses provide useful insights into the relationships between digital choice \nand digital exclusion for the uptake of online learning opportunities. Quantitative analyses such \nas that presented here need to be complemented by more qualitative work in this area that can \ngive researchers and policy makers a more holistic understanding of the role technology plays in \nindividuals\u2019 everyday lives in order to better support and inform lifelong learning initiatives that \nmake use of the Internet.  \n 30 \nNotes \n1. There are factors related to social exclusion measured in OxIS, such as income, physical and \nmental health, and minority status (DiMaggio, et al., 2001; Selwyn and Facer, 2007), that were \nnot included in the analysis presented here. The main reasons for not including these were high \nnon-response rates (e.g. for income) and where the number of participants was too small to \ncreate enough variance with explanatory power (e.g. for ethnic minority). The factors that have \nbeen shown to have high explanatory value in other studies regarding digital disengagement, that \nis education, SES and age, were available through OxIS and have been used here. \n 31 \nReferences  \nBarraket, J.
