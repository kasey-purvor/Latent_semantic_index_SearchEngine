This review attempts to demon-\nstrate the opposite, in the variety of English\nspoken in Liverpool. Despite various media\nreports predicting the death of Liverpool Eng-\nlish, evidence is provided here that the variety\nappears to be resisting the innovation of \u2018T-\nglottalling\u2019, a feature which is frequent else-\nwhere, and instead shows signs of divergence\nfrom any kind of supra-local regional norm.\nIntroduction: dialect levelling in\nthe UK\nOne of the most frequently occurring themes in\nBritish variationist sociolinguistics in recent\nyears has concerned regional dialect levelling,\nthe process by which the particularly regional\nand potentially stigmatised phonological or\ngrammatical features of a dialect gradually dis-\nappear. These features are often replaced with\nwidespread supra-local norms, which reduces\nthe variability typically found between the\ndialects of neighbouring geographical areas.\nBritain (2002:63) argues that \u2018supra-local regi-\nolects\u2019 are being created, which are fewer in\nnumber and larger in geographical size than\nregional dialects, and which are a result of\n\u2018increased intra-regional mobility\u2019 over the lat-\nter half of the 20th century. This article reports\na study of phonological variation and change\nin Liverpool, one of the larger urban centres in\nthe north-west of England. It is argued that\ncertain aspects of Liverpool English (\u2018Scouse\u2019)\npronunciation are resisting levelling, and that\nanother is showing signs of moving not\ntowards a putative regional standard, but is in\nfact diverging from phonological norms.\nThe notion of dialect levelling has been\naround for almost a hundred years (cf. Watt &\nMilroy 1999 for a succinct summary of the\ndevelopment of the term), but it is only quite\nrecently that the mechanisms of levelling are\nbeing thoroughly investigated. Williams & Ker-\nswill (1999:149) provide the often cited defin-\nition of the phenomenon, as \u2018a process whereby\ndifferences between regional varieties are\nreduced, features which make varieties distinc-\ntive disappear, and new features emerge and\nare adopted over a wide geographical area.\u2019\nStrictly speaking, the above characterization\nencompasses two closely related but distinct\nprocesses which Kerswill (2003:223), follow-\ning Trudgill (1986) and Britain (2002), refers\nto as geographical diffusion and levelling respec-\ntively. Geographical diffusion is the process\nwhereby features spread out from a populous\nand economically and culturally dominant cen-\ntre. Levelling, on the other hand, involves the\nreduction of marked variants. \nDOI: 10.1017\/S0266078406002100 \nEnglish Today 86, Vol. 22, No. 2 (April 2006).

While\nhis research interests are in the fields of phonetics\nand phonology, he seeks to combine insights from\nthese areas with variationist sociolinguistics. The\nthree fields are combined in his doctoral thesis, \u2018The\nphonetics and phonology of plosive lenition in\nLiverpool English\u2019. email:\nk.d.watson@lancaster.ac.uk\nEvidence for each of these mechanisms in\nvarieties of British English is plentiful, and has\nbeen noted in Newcastle (Watt & Milroy 1999,\nWatt 2002), Hull, Reading, Milton Keynes\n(Williams and Kerswill 1999), Middlesbrough\n(Llamas 2000), Northamptonshire (Dyer\n2002), Norwich (Trudgill 1999), and else-\nwhere \u2013 see also Britain (2002) and Kerswill\n(2003) for detailed summaries of these and\nsimilar studies. Before we move on to consider\nprocesses of levelling in Liverpool English, we\nbriefly consider a number of examples of the\ntwo different types of levelling mechanisms.\nOne well-known example of levelling via the\nreduction of marked variants is the loss of\nrhotic \/r\/ in most varieties of English in Eng-\nland over the last century. According to Britain\n(2002) r-loss in words like car was evident\neven in the early 19th century and intensified\nand spread throughout the 20th. This spread of\nthe loss of \/r\/, even in rural areas which were\ntraditionally its stronghold, is attributed to\ndialect contact induced by the \u2018gentrification of\nthe countryside\u2019 (Britain 2002:56). Such rural\nlocations have become desirable places to live,\nand have been subjected to influxes of people\nwho are non-rhotic. Connected to this, of\ncourse, is the low prestige and stigma fre-\nquently associated in England with rhoticity.\nAnother example of levelling can be found in\ncertain phonological changes affecting the\nFACE vowel in Tyneside English (cf. Watt &\nMilroy 1999, Watt 2002). The traditional\nTyneside form of this vowel is \/i\u0259\/, which is dif-\nferent from the RP-like closing diphthong \/ei\/,\nand from the monophthongal \/e\u0004\/, which Watt\n(2002:47) terms the \u2018mainstream northern\nvariant\u2019. In modern Tyneside English, how-\never, the traditional FACE vowel is used only\nby older speakers, with the young preferring\nthe mainstream northern variant. Younger\nTynesiders, then, have adopted a supra-local\nnorthern variant over the standard variant and\nas a result are losing one of the features which\nmarks them identifiably as hailing from the\nNorth East. Their desire, Watt (2002) points\nout, is to sound like northerners, but modern\nnortherners, who are aware of \u2013 and are\ninclined to avoid \u2013 \u2018old fashioned\u2019 phonological\nfeatures.\nThe other mechanism of levelling, geograph-\nical diffusion, is most clearly evidenced by con-\nsonantal, rather than vocalic, variables. Ker-\nswill (2003) cites three such variables as the\nclassic examples of geographical diffusion: the\nspread of labiodental [\u0005] for \/r\/, the fronting of\ndental fricatives \/\u03b8, \u00f0\/ to [f, v], and the use of\nthe glottal stop [\u0294] for \/t\/. Space constraints\nrestrict detailed discussion of each of these\nvariables here, so we concentrate in the\nremainder of this section on the geographical\ndiffusion just one of them \u2013 the glottal stop. As\nwe will see, this will be significant for the fol-\nlowing analysis of Liverpool English which\nbegins in the next section.\nThe presence of the glottal stop as a realisa-\ntion of \/t\/ is arguably one of the most common\nphonological process in that it occurs in many\nvarieties of British English. Trudgill (1974)\ndescribes how it was not until the middle of the\n20th century that glottalling gained a foothold\nin most of eastern England (though it was\nattested in London, as well as Glasgow in Scot-\nland, earlier than this), but by then it had not\nyet found its way to the north of England. Now,\nthough, the glottal stop is well attested in\nalmost all British English varieties, from\nReceived Pronunciation (cf. Wells 1982, Crut-\ntenden 1994, Fabricius 2000) to too many\nregional varieties to do justice to here. \nTo gain an indication of the pervasiveness of\nthe glottal stop, it is interesting to note that \/t\/\n\u2192 [\u0294] is evident to some degree in all of the\naccents discussed in Foulkes & Docherty\n(1999), which include Newcastle, Sheffield,\nWest Wirral, Norwich, Reading, Milton\nKeynes, Hull, Cardiff, Glasgow, Edinburgh,\nand Dublin. This is despite the well-known\nobservation that the glottal stop is (or, at the\nvery least, once was) \u2018one of the\u2026 most stig-\nmatised features of British English\u2019 (Milroy,\nMilroy, & Hartley 1994:4). The spread of the\nglottal stop is among the reasons for the recent\nnewspaper reports claiming that all accents are\nbecoming like Estuary English (e.g., \u2018Much ado\nabout nuffin,\u2019 Louisa Young, The Guardian, 2\nJune 1999). Interestingly, as far as our current\nfocus is concerned, other reports have claimed\nthere are similar changes going on in Liverpool\nEnglish (\u2018Scouse is threatened by rising tide of\nEstuary English\u2019, Kathy Marks, The Indepen-\ndent, 1 June 1999). As always with such jour-\nnalistic reports, the claims made must be con-\nsidered with caution. We will reserve further\ncomment for now until we have reviewed the\nlinguistic evidence.\nWe have now seen the two mechanisms of\nlevelling at work: (1) that which reduces the\nvariants which are socially stereotyped and\nreplaces them with some feature which is\n56 ENGLISH TODAY 86 April 2006\nspread over a wider geographical region (for\nexample, r-loss, and loss of the traditional\nTyneside FACE vowel); (2) that which\nincreases the similarity of neighbouring accents\nby spreading features from one to another via\ngeographical diffusion (for example, glot-\ntalling). In the next section, we begin to exam-\nine the evidence for the operation of either of\nthese mechanisms in Liverpool English.\nLiverpool English\nDecades of \u2018Liverpudlian\u2019 exports (including, in\nthe 1960s, the Beatles and Cilla Black; in the\n1980s and 90s, popular UK television shows\nsuch as Brookside; and in the new millennium\nhigh-profile footballers) have helped Liverpool\nEnglish to become one of the more well-recog-\nnised accents of the British Isles. Despite this\nhigh profile, however, the accent has tradition-\nally done badly in polls of \u2018popular accents\u2019 (cf.\nGiles & Trudgill 1978). Commentary about\nLiverpool English in the local and national\npress is undecided with regard to its prestige. \nIn September 2000, a report in the Guardian\nsuggested that the perception of the Liverpool\naccent as friendly and welcoming was the rea-\nson for the surge in telephone call centres in\nthe city (\u2018Scousers put the accent on success\u2019\nDavid Ward, The Guardian, 22 Sept 2000), but\nin December 2005, a report in the Independent\nsuggested the opposite, arguing that having a\nLiverpool accent was detrimental to the speak-\ners\u2019 employment prospects (\u2018How to make it in\nbusiness: don\u2019t have a regional accent\u2019, Ian\nHerbert Smith, The Independent, 29 Dec 05).\nOf course, this sort of popular commentary is\nregularly made of many British accents (Watt\n2002 provides similar examples for Tyneside\nEnglish), but as long as it is considered cau-\ntiously it can shed interesting light on issues\nconcerning the popular perception of the vari-\neties under scrutiny. \nIn terms of linguistic research that has con-\nsidered it, Liverpool English has certainly not\nbeen ignored. We are still some way from\nknowing the full phonetic and phonological\nfacts, but much more consideration has been\npaid to Liverpool English than, say, to Man-\nchester English, or any variety of English spo-\nken in Lancashire. The earliest study of Liver-\npool English, Knowles (1973), remains the\nseminal work and is the investigation which\nhas examined the widest range of linguistic\ndetails. These include both segmental and\nsuprasegmental aspects of Liverpool English\nphonology and features of the variety\u2019s gram-\nmatical system, although Knowles points out\nthat it is aspects of phonology, not syntax,\nwhich are most region-specific. Knowles com-\nments that \u2018the peculiarities of [Liverpool Eng-\nlish] are almost entirely phonological. When\nsomeone speaks, he produces a constant\nstream of prosodic patterns and segmental fea-\ntures which mark him unmistakably as a Liver-\npudlian\u2019 (1973:50).\nThese \u2018unmistakable\u2019 features have been\nstudied more recently from a number of differ-\nent perspectives. Sangster (2001) provides a\ndetailed phonetic account of Liverpool English\nalveolar plosives, and Honeybone (2001)\nexamines the voiceless alveolar and velar stops\nphonologically. A phonetic and phonological\nanalysis is combined in Watson (forthcoming),\nwhich investigates each of the six plosives in\nutterance-final position. However, whilst\nKnowles has provided a detailed investigation\nof 1960s Liverpool English, and other studies\nhave considered the contemporary linguistic\nsystem, no work has been carried out which\nattempts to compare the two in order to exam-\nine issues of phonological change in the variety. \nWe are therefore as yet unable to consider\nthe Liverpool English phonological system in\nterms of the discussion of dialect levelling\nabove. This paper provides the necessary com-\nparison by examining the parallels between the\nobservations of Knowles (1973) and a new cor-\npus of data from 16 adolescents (collected in\n2001). Before we consider the phonological\nfeatures under discussion here, we end this\nsection with a general illustration of the impor-\ntant aspects of the Liverpool English phonolog-\nical system.\nAs expected, given the geographical location\nof the city, Liverpool shares numerous phono-\nlogical features with other north-western cities.\nLike other accents in the north, for example, the\nSTRUT and FOOT vowels are typically the same\n(i.e. [\u03c5]), and the BATH vowel is the short [a].\nThe START & PALM vowels are typically front\nfor working-class speakers (i.e. [a\u0004]) whereas\nthe middle class make a modification to an RP-\nlike [\u0251\u0004]. The middle class are also more likely\nto have an RP-like distinction between the\nNURSE and SQUARE lexical sets, using a cen-\ntral [\n\u0004] and something like the fronter [\u03b5\u0004]\nrespectively. Working-class speakers typically\nexhibit a lack of contrast in these sets, which\nhave merged to the front variant [\u03b5\u0004]. \nPHONOLOGICAL RESISTANCE AND INNOVATION IN THE NORTH-WEST OF ENGLAND 57\nWords such as book, cook and look typically\nhave the long vowel of the GOOSE set rather\nthan that of the FOOT set, like elsewhere in the\nnorth. Perhaps the biggest difference between\nLiverpool English vowels and those of many\nother northern English varieties is that Liver-\npool English has diphthongs where other\nnorthern varieties would use monophthongs.\nThe SQUARE lexical set mentioned above\nexcepted, the other sets, including CHOICE,\nPRICE, FACE, GOAT and MOUTH have (rising)\ndiphthongs. \nWith the consonantal system, too, there are\nsimilarities with other northern Englishes, but,\nas we shall see, it is here that there are the great-\nest number of features more or less unique to\nLiverpool. Like other varieties in the West and\nNorth West of England, the [\f] in words such as\nthing and singer is maintained, e.g. [\u03b8i\u014b\f,\nsi\u014b\f\u03b5]. Knowles (1973:301) observes that,\nalthough reduplicated forms such as singing\n[si\u014b\fi\u014b\f] are not common, they are attested.\nThe velar nasal\/alveolar-nasal alternation\nfound in other varieties is also attested, e.g.\nsinging [si\u014b\fin]. Liverpool English \/r\/ is tapped\nin non-initial position, e.g. mirror [mi\u027e\u03b5], Amer-\nican [\u0259m\u03b5\u027eik\u0259n], breath [b\u027e\u03b5\u03b8], but red [\u0279\u03b5d],\nright [\u0279ait]. A phonological feature of Liverpool\nEnglish which is more geographically restricted\nthan the features examined so far is the \u2018stop-\nping\u2019 of the dental fricatives \/\u03b8, \u00f0\/. Knowles\n(1973:331) shows that whilst the middle class\ntypically favour the standard variants [\u03b8] and\n[\u00f0], the working class often use dentalised or\nlaminal alveolar stops in both initial, final and\nintervocalic positions, e.g. the [d\u0010\u0259], brother\n[b\u027e\u03c5d\u0010\u03b5], plinth [plint\u0010]. Knowles does not find\nTH-fronting in the variety. \nThe final set of consonantal variables to be\ndiscussed here are the most regionally\nrestricted of all Liverpool English phonological\nfeatures, and contribute most strongly to the\nstereotype. This feature is the lenition of\nphonological plosives. Lenition is a cover term\nfor a set of phonological processes which are\noften glossed as the softening or weakening of\nplosives to affricates and fricatives (see Watson\nforthcoming). As Hughes and Trudgill\n(1996:93) put it: Liverpool English \u2018\/p, t, k\/ are\nheavily aspirated or even affricated. Thus, can\u2019t\n[kx\u0251\u0004nt], straight [st\u027eeits], back [bakx]. In final\nposition, \/p, t, k\/ may be realised as fricatives\n[\u03c6 s x].\u2019 \nThe voiced plosives also lenite [that is, are\nrealised as affricates or fricatives], as Knowles\n(1973) points out, although Watson (forth-\ncoming) demonstrates that \/b\/ and \/g\/ lenite far\nless frequently than \/d\/ or any of the voiceless\nstops. It is, in fact, \/t\/ and \/k\/ which lenite most\nfrequently of all the stops, and it is unsurpris-\ning therefore that these segments have\nattracted the attention of most modern\nresearch (Sangster 2001, Honeybone 2001,\nHoneybone & Watson 2001, Honeybone\n2002). \nI will also focus here on one of these seg-\nments, \/t\/, not only because it is a classic lenit-\ning variable of Liverpool English phonology\n(and one of the features of the variety which is\nmost stereotypical and geographically\nrestricted), but also because the glottalling of\n\/t\/ (as seen in the previous discussion) is one of\nthe classic features of dialect levelling. Accord-\ningly, it is with respect to \/t\/ that the mecha-\nnisms of levelling should be visible, if indeed\nsuch mechanisms are at work in contemporary\nLiverpool English. However, before consider-\ning whether this is indeed so, some more infor-\nmation on the nature of Liverpool English \/t\/ in\nthe 1960s is in order. \nLiverpool English \/t\/ in the 1960s\nAs well as the phonological processes of\naffrication and spirantisation outlined above,\nKnowles has observed an additional process he\ncalls \u2018\/t\/ elision\u2019. This is not simply a product of\ncoarticulation, but is tightly constrained by the\nLiverpool English linguistic system. He argues\n(1973:234), for example, that \u2018there is a small\nclass of words including get got bit what that it\nnot in which the final \/t\/ is pronounced before\nanother consonant but can be elided in\nabsolute final position\u2019. This is not the replace-\nment of \/t\/ with a glottal stop, as Knowles notes\nthat the glottal stop is rare in the variety.\nInstead, there is absence of both an oral ges-\nture and a glottal closing gesture (elsewhere, I\nhave called this process \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 rather than \u2018t-eli-\nsion\u2019 because there is an audible release of\nbreath, and I will retain that label here: see\nWatson 2005 & Watson forthcoming for fur-\nther discussion). What is crucial for the follow-\ning analysis is that in 1960s Liverpool English,\n\u2018t\u2192h\u2019 (that is, Knowles\u2019 t-elision) was only\nattested in monosyllabic function words (and\nhigh frequency \u2018pseudo\u2019 function words like get\nand got) with short vowels, in pre-pausal posi-\ntion.\nThe presence of \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 is a classic potential\n58 ENGLISH TODAY 86 April 2006\ncandidate to be lost via either levelling or geo-\ngraphical diffusion. First, \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 occurs almost\nuniquely in Liverpool English (although see\nHickey 1999 for a discussion of Dublin Eng-\nlish), and is a salient marker of the stereotype.\nLiverpool is surrounded by accent varieties\nwhich do not exhibit this process. In addition\nto this, the environment for \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 is exactly the\nenvironment where we might expect glottal\nreplacement to occur \u2013 the process that is\nspreading throughout almost all British Eng-\nlish varieties. \nGiven the above, two questions arise. The\nfirst is: Does \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 still occur in contemporary\nLiverpool English, and if so, does it occur in the\nsame tightly constrained environments? The\nsecond is: Has the glottal stop, which was rare\nin the 1960s, made any inroads to try to sup-\nplant this particularly Liverpudlian feature?\nSome light on these issues emerges from a con-\nsideration of new data.\nThe new data\nThe data on which the following remarks are\nbased was collected in 2001 from 16 adoles-\ncent speakers of Liverpool English. All speak-\ners, who were born and raised in the electoral\nward of Vauxhall as in Knowles\u2019 previous work,\nwere asked to complete two elicitation tasks.\nThe first required them to rearrange the order\nof words in a series of sentences to make them\ngrammatical. Each sentence for this task was\nwritten so that the only possible correct answer\nplaced the target word in pre-pausal position.\nThe second task involved role-playing dialogue\nbetween a pair of speakers. As with the first\ntask, each target word here was also pre-\npausal. The tasks generated 945 tokens of pre-\npausal \/t\/. The target words are presented in\nTable 1, sorted according to their segmental\nand prosodic patterning. Those words in col-\numn A represent the only words that would\nallow \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 in 1960s Liverpool English.\nDuring the analysis, spectrograms were\nexamined and phonological stops were cate-\ngorised according to whether there was an oral\ngesture or not. That is, no distinction was\nmade between \u2018aspirate\u2019, \u2018affricate\u2019 or \u2018fricative\u2019\ntokens and all were classified as \u2018oral\u2019. If no\noral gesture was detected, the glottal gesture\nwas further classified as either a glottal frica-\ntive or a glottal stop. \nContemporary Liverpool English \/t\/\nTable 2 presents the percentage of tokens in\nwhich \/t\/ was articulated with an oral gesture.\nThe greater the percentage, the more times \/t\/\nwas realised either as an aspirate, an affricate,\nor a fricative, but not [\u0294] or [h]. In fact, of all\n945 tokens of pre-pausal \/t\/, there was not a\nsingle case of a glottal stop. Therefore, in Table\n2, the lower the word in the table, the higher\nthe frequency of \u2018t\u2192h\u2019.\nIt is clear that the presence of \u2018t(h\u2019 is still\nrobust in monosyllabic function words with\nshort vowels. For example, all the words in\nwhich \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 never occurs are lexical items,\nexcept one, out, and [h] is prohibited here by\nvirtue of the long vowel. The monosyllabic\nwords in which \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 occurs most consistently\nare indeed function words with short vowels.\nFor example, \/t\/ is realised as [h] over 70% of\nthe time in that, what, not, and at. Other\nmonosyllabic lexical words (e.g. bet, cat, eat,\nget, pot, shot, net) have an oral gesture for \/t\/\n100% of the time.

(\u2018t\u2192h\u2019 = 0%)\nIn each of the above pairs, the lexical items\nnever exhibit \u2018t\u2192h\u2019, but the grammatical words\nhave [h] very consistently. \nHowever, to account for the presence of\n\u2018t\u2192h\u2019 with a generalisation such as \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 can\noccur in monosyllabic function words with short\nvowels, is no longer sufficient, and it is here\nthat the current data differs most significantly\nfrom previous work on the phenomenon. It is\nclear that, as well as being frequent in mono-\nsyllabic function words with short vowels,\n\u2018t\u2192h\u2019 is now also common in polysyllabic\nwords. Indeed, the three words in which \u2018t\u2192h\u2019\noccurs most frequently (100% of the time) are\npolysyllabic: biscuit, bucket and chocolate.\nOther polysyllabic words in which \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 occurs\nfrequently include maggot, Robert, target, and\nticket (over 80% of the time) and merit\n(around 70% of the time). It is not restricted to\nbisyllabic words, as the frequent presence of\n\u2018t\u2192h\u2019 in aggregate (58%), certificate (85%) and\ndelicate (73%) demonstrates.\nThe presence of \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 is not random here\nbecause as with monosyllabic words, there are\npolysyllabic words which never exhibit it.\nThese include acrobat, internet, cigarette, reset,\nteapot, and tonight. Table 3 lists the polysyl-\nlabic words in which \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 is and is not\nattested. The No \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 column in the table indi-\ncates that \/t\/ is always realised with an oral ges-\nture. The \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 column includes words in\nwhich \/t\/ is sometimes realised as [h]. It should\nbe noted that in the \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 column the word in\nwhich \/t\/ is realised as [h] least often is aggre-\ngate, and even here \/t\/ has no oral gesture 58%\nof the time.\nThis time, the conditioning environment for\npolysyllabic words is phonological. Almost all\nwords in which \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 occurs have unstressed\nfinal syllables, and so, in each case, the final \/t\/\nis preceded by a weak vowel. Every word in\nwhich \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 is prohibited has final syllable\nstress (tonight, cigarette) or secondary stress\non the final syllable (acrobat, internet), and so\nends in a full, non-weak vowel. The only word\nin the data set which does not follow this pat-\ntern, that is, which is stressed on the final syl-\nlable yet still allows \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 is forgot. One expla-\nnation for this may be that the speakers have\ngeneralised by analogy from got, which Table 2\nshowed also allowed \u2018t\u2192h\u2019. In fact, we can con-\nsider the relationship between pot and jackpot,\nand net and internet in this regard. The poly-\nsyllabic word forgot allows \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 despite its\nfinal syllable stress arguably because the high\nfrequency monosyllabic word got exhibits it.\nThe words pot and net, on the other hand, do\nnot exhibit \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 at all, and so the polysyllabic\nwords jackpot and internet, do not allow \u2018t\u2192h\u2019\neither. This explanation can only be tentative,\nbut it seems at least plausible.\nIn summary, then, the lexical and phonolog-\n60 ENGLISH TODAY 86 April 2006\nTable 2\n100 acrobat, bet, boycott, cat,\ncigarette, eat, get (n), height,\nhot, internet, knot, jackpot,\nlight, net, out, pit, pot, pet,\nright, reset, shot, shout, teapot,\ntonight, watt, wrote, weight,\nwait\n70\u201399 yet\n50\u201369 lot\n30\u201349 merit, get, bit, aggregate\n1\u201329 delicate, at, got, it, not,\ncertificate, forgot, maggot,\nticket, target, Robert, that, what\n0 biscuit, bucket, chocolate\n%age Words\ncontaining \noral gesture\nTable 3 The presence of \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 in polysyllabic\nwords\naggregate acrobat\nbiscuit cigarette\nbucket internet\ncertificate jackpot\nchocolate reset\ndelicate teapot\nforgot tonight\nmaggot\nticket\ntarget\nRobert\n\u2018t\u2192h\u2019 No \u2018t\u2192h\u2019\nical environments in which \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 occurs have\nextended since Knowles\u2019 (1973) consideration\nof the phenomenon; \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 is not completely\nunrestricted, but its domain of application is\nmuch wider. The process has spread from\noccurring solely in monosyllabic words with\nshort vowels to polysyllabic words which end\nin a syllable with a weak vowel.\nConclusion: divergence\nEarlier in this article, we saw how Liverpool\nEnglish \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 was a strong potential candidate\nto be lost via either geographical diffusion\n(because of the rapid spread of the glottal stop)\nor levelling (because it is one of the features of\nthe variety which is socially marked). How-\never, there is no evidence of this in the new\ndata. First, the glottal stop is not spreading to\nutterance-final position, where \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 still\noccurs. As well as this, the phonological and\nlexical constraints on \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 have extended, so\nthat \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 now occurs in a wider range of\nwords than before.\nIt has been observed that phonological diver-\ngence among accents of British English has not\nbeen frequently documented (Kerswill 2003).\nHowever, it seems that in resisting the spread\nof the glottal stop, Liverpool English is resisting\none of the processes of supralocalisation which\nis widely attested elsewhere in Britain. In addi-\ntion, the extension of \u2018t\u2192h\u2019 provides evidence\nthat Liverpool English is not, as the popular\npress would have us believe, losing its region-\nality but is instead moving in the opposite\ndirection and diverging from supra-local\nnorms. \u0002\nReferences\nBritain, David. 2002. \u2018Phoenix from the ashes?: the\ndeath, contact and birth of dialects in England.\u2019 In\nEssex Research Reports in Linguistics 41:42\u201373.\nCruttenden, Alan. 1994.
