However, many\nphysiological processes are quite complex, and in many instances students encounter difficulties in\nunderstanding the dynamics. This paper describes the rationale behind an alternative approach\nusing interactive three-dimensional computer-graphics simulation to aid comprehension of\nscientific concepts.\nIntroduction\nThere exist a number of areas in the teaching of physiology which potentially lend\nthemselves to a Computer-Based Learning approach. One such area which has been\nexplored at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and elsewhere (Dewhurst, 1993;\nKwan, 1993) is the use of multimedia tools to simulate aspects of experiments\ntraditionally performed on animals. The use of real animal specimens (for example, frogs\nor rats) for dissection and experimentation is both costly and contrary to the ethics of\nsome students.\nA related but different area which we are currently investigating is that of scientific\nvisualization in relation to animal physiology - that is, the visualization of processes\nwhich often are difficult or impossible to see except either through the measurements\ngenerated on instruments such as chart recorders and oscilloscopes, or the diagrams\nprovided by textbooks. This information is generally of an abstract nature, and students\nfind some of it difficult to grasp using two-dimensional static diagrams of the kind\nprovided in textbooks or handouts. The nature of the textbook medium prohibits some\nkey dynamic ideas coming across. At MMU a collaborative study between the\ndepartments of Computing and Biological Sciences is investigating the possibility of using\nthree-dimensional interactive simulations, or Virtual Laboratory environments, to\n53\nGeoff B\u00e4ndle et o\/. A virtual laboratory system for physiology teaching\nprovide concept visualization tools for biologists. The present study is focused on one\nparticular set of physiological processes - those which occur at the neuromuscular\njunction. That process, it is hoped, will provide a vehicle for exploring the requirements of\nrelated applications and lead to the development of software tools which can be used to\ngenerate solutions more generally.\nThe neuromuscular junction\nThe junction between nerve strands and muscle fibres is typical of a number of\nphysiological processes where understanding is difficult using standard diagrams. The\nsequence of events which occurs at the neuromuscular junction during the initiation of\nmuscle contraction is complex. It includes the arrival of action potentials, calcium flux\nchanges, merging of synaptic vesicles with junction membrane, release of\nneurotransmitter from vesicles into the junction cleft, interaction with muscle membrane\nreceptors, pore changes and ion fluxes. An appreciation of the dynamic aspects of the\nsequence is essential to an understanding of the varying levels of activity seen in muscle\nranging from a single twitch to a sustained contraction. A clear understanding of the\nbasic process is also essential before consideration of variation in activity at these\njunctions associated with the effects of drugs, toxins and disease processes.\nThe Virtual Reality approach\nThere are many variants of Virtual Reality (VR) systems. A good overview is provided by\nBarker in an earlier issue of ALT-J (Barker, 1993).\nVR systems are less of a new technology than an integration of several existing\ntechnologies, the chief of which are 3D computer graphics display and animation,\ncomputer modelling and simulation, real-time systems and novel input and output device\ntechnologies. When these technologies are combined fully, it is possible to produce\nsystems where the user can feel immersed within an authentic, albeit synthetic world and\nwhere he or she can manipulate that world in a natural and familiar way. In such a\nsystem, the user interface becomes transparent, and the user feels as though he\/she is\ninside the model data space. Rheingold (1991) provides a very readable and detailed\nhistorical perspective of VR technologies.\nAdvantages of a VR approach\nThe underlying assumption of this project is that the construction and use of systems can\nbe guided by the VR ideal even though they may fall somewhat short of a fully immersive\nsystem. Some of the reasons for such a stance are:\n\u2022 The use of a 3D model and 3D viewing facilities allow more complex objects,\nbehaviours and relationships to be displayed and manipulated. This is important where\nthe relationships in the world being modelled are complex. The value of 3D\nrepresentations has been repeatedly shown in the field of Computer Aided Design\n(CAD).\n54\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\n\u2022 VR systems go beyond traditional CAD modelling in the degree of realism provided.\nTexture is added to the surface of object geometries to provide detail, and the use of\nperspective and illumination\/reflection modelling provides depth cues. This gives a\nsense of authenticity so that the user can use intuitive notions of depth and space\nderived from everyday life to understand the structures and relationships in the\nconceptual world.\n\u2022 VR provides simulation based on a stored model of the process under study so that the\nparameters of this model can be changed. Understanding can be actively acquired by\nexperimentation, a method in keeping with current educational thinking.\n\u2022 A key feature of virtual worlds is interactivity. It should be possible to interact with\nsynthetic worlds in the same way as we interact with real worlds. As a result,\ninteraction tasks are more natural, and the amount of training needed is reduced\n(Balaguer & Gobbetti, 1993).\n\u2022 Scientists are trained in the use of instruments and measuring devices as well as in the\nspecifics of the particular process or object under consideration. Typically, students\nneed to learn how to calibrate instruments, how to position measurement probes, and\nhow to use the options and switches on instrument panels. If learning how to use the\ncomputer interface can be made identical to learning to use traditional instrument\ninterfaces, then existing knowledge of such interfaces which the student brings to the\ninteraction can be profitably used and reinforced.\nA prototype virtual laboratory\nA prototype virtual laboratory is currently at an early stage of development at MMU.\nFor development purposes, a VR development system - World Tool Kit for Windows -\nprovides a set of rendering tools and interaction controls which are called from C\nprogramming language interface. The software runs on a PC but requires good floating-\npoint capabilities (DX2 or Pentium) processors. Since the intention is to use the system\nwith undergraduate students, it is important that it can be implemented on a desktop\nsystem using relatively cheap interaction equipment.\nSome areas of difficulty\nThe VR laboratory is clearly an ambitious project offering many potential problems and\nchallenges. While initial work has been promising, we are aware of a number of key\nproblem areas:\nAnimation\nDesktop VR development environments are proving to be usable in a number of contexts.\nHowever, animation is usually in the form of a walkthrough or flyby where the world\nbeing navigated stays relatively static. The provision of worlds containing multiple\ninteracting objects is more problematic. Convincing animation requires attention to many\ndetails concerning the way that objects move, and it is traditionally a time-consuming\nprogramming activity.\n\u00a15\nGeoff Brindle et al. A virtual laboratory system for physiology teaching\nInteraction\nThe design and development of virtual tools is an area requiring substantial design and\ndevelopment effort. Researchers are only just beginning to explore the possibilities\n(Balaguer & Gobetti, 1993).\nDevelopment lead times\nIt is clear that the provision of authoring tools is ultimately necessary if technologies like\nVR are to have any impact on learning. The amount of work involved in producing\nlearning material is otherwise excessive and the need for specialist subject knowledge is a\nlimitation. It should be possible for lecturers in a particular specialism to produce\ninteractive simulations themselves easily, and within a reasonable timescale (Van Dam,\n1992).\nConclusions\nThe virtual-world ideal, while perhaps not perfectly realizable given today's technology\nand the need for desktop solutions, can nevertheless be used as a model to guide the\ndesign of CAL tools. A range of VR development toolkits and authoring systems are\nbeginning to emerge, and these will be added to as more experience is gained. Already\nthese tools are being used in entertainment and in the design of products in industry. At\nMMU we are developing tools aimed at the application of VR in specific educational\ncontexts, with the aim of providing software tools that can be used generally in the area of\nconceptual visualization.\nReferences\nBalaguer, J.F. & Gobbetti, E.
