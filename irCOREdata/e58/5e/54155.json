INTRODUCTION \nLLPASS real valued rational IIR filters are found in many \nsignal processing, communications and control \napplications [1]-[12]. On the other hand, real valued rational \nIIR filters with both the strictly stable and the minimal phase \nproperties are found in many analog-to-digital conversion \napplications [13]. \nThe most common allpass real valued rational IIR filters are \nthat with the numerator coefficients being the flip version of \nthe denominator coefficients. For those filters, the zeros are \nthe complex conjugate reciprocal of the poles. In other words, \nif these filters are strictly stable, then they are not minimal \nphase. \nSince both the strictly stable and the minimal phase \nproperties are important for some applications, it would be \nuseful to relax the allpass condition to a near allpass condition \nand design a near allpass strictly stable minimal phase real \nvalued rational IIR filter so that the maximum absolute phase \nerror is minimized subject to a specification on the maximum \nabsolute allpass error. However, this design problem is \nactually a nonsmooth optimization problem subject to both \nlinear and quadratic functional inequality constraints, which is \nvery difficult to solve. This brief is to address this issue.  \n The outline of this brief is as follows. In Section II, \nnotations used throughout this brief are introduced. In Section \nIII, the design of a near allpass strictly stable minimal phase \nreal valued rational IIR filter is formulated as a nonsmooth \noptimization problem. The problem is then approximated by a \nsmooth problem so that our previous proposed method can be \napplied for solving the problem. In Section IV, computer \nnumerical simulation results are presented. Finally, \nconclusions are drawn in Section V. \nII. NOTATIONS \nDenote the frequency response of a rational IIR filter as ( )\u03c9H . Denote the order of the numerator transfer function and \nthat of the denominator transfer function as M  and , \nrespectively. Denote the numerator coefficients as  for \nN\nmb\nMm ,,1,0 L=  and the denominator coefficients as  for na\nNn ,,1,0 L= . In this brief, as we only consider real valued \nrational IIR filters, so we assume that \u211c\u2208mb  for \nMm ,,1,0 L= , \u211c\u2208na  for , Nn ,,2,1 L= 10 =a  and \n( )\n\u2211\n\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n= N\nn\njn\nn\nM\nm\njm\nm\nea\neb\nH\n0\n0\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 . A rational IIR filter is said to be achieved \nan allpass characteristic if ( ) 1=\u03c9H  . [ ]\u03c0\u03c0\u03c9 ,\u2212\u2208\u2200\nIII. PROBLEM FORMULATION \nAs discussed in Section I that for those allpass real valued \nrational IIR filters with the numerator coefficients being the \nflip version of the denominator coefficients, if they are strictly \nstable, then they are not minimal phase. Since stability is a \nvery important property because of safety reasons, stability \nhas to be guaranteed. For some applications, such as some \napplications in analog-to-digital conversions, minimal phase \nproperty is also important. For these applications, the allpass \ncharacteristic is relaxed and a near allpass strictly stable \nminimal phase real valued rational IIR filter is designed. \nManuscript received June 18, 2007; revised July 30, 2007.

COMPUTER NUMERICAL SIMULATION RESULTS \nAlthough there are plenty existing designs on allpass \nstrictly stable real valued rational IIR filters, none of them are \nminimal phase. Hence, it is difficult to have a fair \ncomparison. As minimal phase real valued FIR filters are a \nparticular type of real valued rational filters satisfying both \nthe minimal phase and the strictly stable conditions, minimal \nphase real valued FIR filters are compared. For an interesting \npurpose, conventional strictly stable non-minimal phase real \nvalued rational allpass IIR filters are also compared. \nSince fractional delay filters are found in many \napplications [7]-[12] including the A\/D conversion \napplication [17], a fractional delay strictly stable minimal \nphase real valued IIR filter is designed. The phase response \nof the filter is in the form of ( ) \u03c9\u03c9 mHd =\u2220  where m  is a \nrational number. In this brief, \n6\n1=m  is chosen. As all \ndiscrete-time filters are \u03c02  periodic, the frequency response \nof the corresponding ideal fractional delay filter contains a \ndiscontinuity at the frequencies \u03c0\u03c9 =  and \u03c0\u03c9 \u2212= . Hence, \nthe passband of the filter excludes neighborhoods around \u03c0  \nand \u03c0\u2212 . Denote the band of interest as [ ]\u0394\u2212\u2212\u0394= \u03c0\u03c0 ,tB , \nwhere  refers to the transition bandwidth. \u0394  depends on \u03942\nM ,  and N \u03b5 . In general, the larger the values of M ,  and N\n\u03b5  would result to a smaller value of \u0394 . However, large \nvalues of M  and  would increase the computational \nefforts, while too small values of \nN\nM ,  and N \u03b5  may not \nresult to a solution. To tradeoff among these specifications, \n10=M , 10=N , \u03c005.0=\u0394  and 40\u2212=\u03b5 dB ( ) are chosen \nbecause these values are typical in many applications. In \norder to convert the nonsmooth optimization problem to a \nsmooth one, the values of \n01.0\n\u03b4  and \u03b4 \u2032  play an important role. If \n\u03b4  and \u03b4 \u2032  are large, then the optimization problem is smooth, \nbut the difference between the original nonsmooth \noptimization problem and the approximated problem is large. \nOn the other hand, if \u03b4  and \u03b4 \u2032  are small, then the difference \nbetween the original nonsmooth optimization problem and \nthe approximated problem is small, but the problem becomes \nless smooth. To tradeoff between these factors,  \nare chosen because this value is typical for most applications \n[16]. \n610\u2212=\u2032= \u03b4\u03b4\nBy following the formulation discussed in Section III and \napplying our proposed method discussed in [16] for solving \nthe optimization problem, the near allpass strictly stable \nminimal phase real valued rational IIR filter could be \ndesigned. Since there are 21 coefficients in the designed IIR \nfilter, a near allpass minimal phase FIR filter with 21 \ncoefficients is designed for a comparison. The magnitude and \nthe phase responses of the designed IIR filter, the \nconventional strictly stable non-minimal phase real valued \nrational allpass IIR filter and the FIR filter are shown in \nFigure 1a and Figure 1b, respectively. The absolute allpass \nerrors and the absolute phase errors of these filters are shown \nin Figure 1c and Figure 1d, respectively. The poles and the \nzeros of the designed IIR filter, the conventional IIR filter \nand the FIR filter are shown in Figure 2a, Figure 2b and \nFigure 2c, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 2a that all \nthe poles and the zeros of our designed IIR filter are strictly \ninside the unit circle. Hence, our designed IIR filter satisfies \nboth the strictly stable and the minimal phase conditions. On \nthe other hand, all the zeros of the conventional IIR filter are \noutside the unit circle. Hence, the conventional IIR filter is \nnon-minimal phase. \nAlthough it can be seen from Figure 2c that all the zeros of \nthe FIR filter are strictly inside the unit circle, it can be seen \nfrom Figure 1c that the maximum absolute allpass error of the \nFIR filter is larger than -40dB. Hence, the FIR filter does not \nsatisfy the maximum absolute allpass constraint. On the other \nhand, the maximum absolute allpass error of our designed IIR \nfilter is -40.0529dB, in which it satisfies the required \nspecification. Although the conventional IIR filter could \nideally achieve the zero maximum absolute allpass error, the \nmaximum absolute phase error of the conventional IIR filter \nis just closed to that of our designed IIR filter, while that of \nFIR filter is unacceptable. \nAlthough it is hard to guarantee that the obtained solution \nis the global optimal solution, we have run the optimization \nalgorithm using 50 different initial conditions and find that \nthe solutions corresponding to all these initial conditions are \nthe same. Hence, even though the obtained solution is a local \noptimal solution, it corresponds to the optimal solution within \nthe most common ranges of filter coefficients. \n 3\nTCASII: 4863 \n \n4\nV. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this brief, the allpass condition is relaxed to a near \nallpass condition so that a strictly stable minimal phase real \nvalued IIR filter is designed. The design problem is actually a \nminimax nonsmooth optimization problem subject to both \nlinear and quadratic functional inequality constraints. To solve \nthis problem, the nonsmooth cost function is approximated by \na smooth function and our previous proposed method is \napplied for solving the problem. Computer numerical \nsimulation results show that a small maximum absolute phase \nerror could be achieved subject to a small maximum absolute \nallpass error. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this brief was supported by a research \ngrant from an Australian Research Council. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Dennis R.
