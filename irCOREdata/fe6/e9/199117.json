Introduction \n \nThe debate on the economic effects of minimum wages remains a controversial and heavily \nresearched question. In fact there currently appears to be something of a methodological \ndivide amongst economists about what minimum wages actually do to economic outcomes. \nSome researchers choose to stick to what used to be the orthodoxy, at least since Brown, \nGilroy and Kohen\u2019s (1982) influential survey of the evidence available up to the late 1970s, \nthat minimum wages are bad for employment, especially teenage employment. Others have \nbeen more swayed by the recent \u2018before and after\u2019 micro work (Card, 1992, Card and \nKrueger, 1994, 1995) which finds it hard to identify any employment effect at all and moves \nthe question on from \u2018how negative is the minimum wage employment effect?\u2019 to \u2018is there \nany impact on employment at all?\u2019 The vast majority of work used to inform this debate is \nbased upon US data (Brown, 1999). Some fresh evidence, from a different context, probably \nneeds to be cast on these questions.1 We attempt to offer some evidence of this sort in this \npaper, where we have a unique design setting induced by the introduction of a minimum \nwage to a labour market previously unregulated by minimum wage legislation. \nIn April 1999 a National Minimum Wage (NMW) was introduced to the UK labour \nmarket. This is the first time that the UK has had an economy wide minimum wage. \nFurthermore, because the old industry-based Wages Council system that used to regulate pay \nin some sectors was abolished in 1993, the NMW was introduced into a labour market with \nno minimum wage legislation in operation.2  Given these circumstances one can think of the \nintroduction of the UK NMW as providing a very good testing ground for evaluating the \neconomic effects of minimum wages. In fact one can plausibly argue that it provides a better \ntesting ground than much of the \u2018before and after\u2019 US work on minimum wage effects (see \n                                                          \n1 Indeed, one of Hamermesh\u2019s (2002) prime examples of where international empirical work in labour \neconomics is required to inform the US debate is the research area on minimum wages. \n2  Except in agriculture. The Agricultural Wages Board was not abolished along with the other Wages Councils. \n 5 \nthe discussion in Card and Krueger, 1995) as they are all based upon minimum wage \nincreases where a minimum wage floor was already in place.  \nIn this paper we look at what happened when the UK minimum wage was introduced \nin a low wage sector one can view as being particularly vulnerable to minimum wages, the \nUK residential care homes industry. Our analysis is based upon a large-scale survey that we \ncarried out before and after the introduction of the NMW.  The survey focused upon the \nwhole population of residential care homes in Britain, collecting information on all workers \nin the homes, and on an array of home characteristics.   \nWe chose to look at this sector for several reasons.  First, it contains many low-wage \nworkers, so the minimum wage has real potential to have a noticeable impact on outcomes.3 \nSecond, we chose this sector because it is not unionised.  Thirdly, it consists of large numbers \nof small firms (average employment being somewhere in the range of 15-20 workers) doing a \nvery homogeneous activity in geographically concentrated markets. The small size of these \nfirms means that monitoring problems are unlikely to be severe because the owner normally \nalso works in the home and also that collection of good quality data on all workers is feasible. \nFinally, the product market side of this sector is interesting. An important fraction of the \nresidents of these homes have their care paid for by the Department for Social Security \n(DSS).  But, the amount they pay is capped and was not increased when the minimum was \nintroduced.4 Homes whose residents are paid for by the DSS are then in a situation where \nthey are not able to pass any of their cost increases on to prices: this is likely to increase the \nscope for identifying employment effects from minimum wage introduction.   \n                                                          \n3 This logic is, of course, similar in spirit to Castillo-Freeman and Freeman\u2019s (1991) study of Puerto Rico. \nFocusing on situations where more low paid workers are present obviously heightens the chance of finding \nemployment effects of minimum wages. \n4 One may worry that other regulatory changes occurred at the same time as the introduction of the minimum \nwage. We were not able to find any such changes so ensuring our before and after analysis of wage and \nemployment effects associated with minimum wage introduction are not contaminated by other coincident \npolicy changes. \n 6 \nThere is, of course, one disadvantage to looking at a sector in which minimum wages \nreally \u2018bite\u2019, namely that one is more likely to find negative effects of minimum wages on \nemployment. While labour economists have debated the relative merits of perfect competition \nor monopsony as models to explain the negative, positive or non-existent effects of minimum \nwages on employment (see, for example, Brown, 1999, for a recent review of this), all \nmodels of the labour market predict that a high enough minimum wage will reduce \nemployment. So, one must be careful not to extrapolate from studies of one sector (especially \nthe kind of sector we study) to conclusions about the economy as a whole. \n We consider what happened to wages and employment in the care homes sector in the \nperiod surrounding the introduction of the NMW. The analysis confirms that the choice of \nsector is a good one for studying the likely impact of minimum wages.  Pay is very low, with \nthe average hourly wage being around \u00a34 just before the minimum wage introduction.  \nBefore its introduction around 1 in 3 workers were paid less than the minimum wage.  In \nApril 1999 we see a spike in the wage distribution of around 30 percent at the minimum \nwage. The minimum wage clearly \u2018bit hard\u2019 in this sector.  It therefore provides a very good \nenvironment for looking at the impact of the minimum wage on employment. \n We look at the employment effects of the minimum wage by considering what is now \na standard technique in the empirical literature on minimum wages and employment. This \nrelates changes in employment before and after the minimum wage introduction to the \nfraction of low paid workers in the pre-minimum wage period (see, for example, Card\u2019s, \n1992, state based study of an increase in the US federal minimum wage in the early 1990s).  \nIn summary we find a sizable wage impact, together with moderate employment and hours \nreductions following the introduction of the minimum wage.  \n The rest of the paper is structured as follows.  Section II presents a brief history of \nminimum wage legislation in the UK and some summary statistics on employment over time \n 7 \nin the sector upon which we focus. Section III describes our data collection process and \npresents some descriptive statistics. Section IV reports empirical findings on the wage effects \nof the minimum wage. Section V then moves on to consider the employment and hours \neffects, together with a brief investigation of other possible outcomes.  Section VI then \nconcludes. \n \nII. Minimum Wages in the UK and the Care Homes Sector \nMinimum Wages in the UK \nUnlike many other countries, minimum wages have historically not had a very important role \nto play in the UK labour market.  This is certainly true at the national level where there has \nnever been an economy wide minimum wage floor. But minimum wages used to be a factor \nin some low wage sectors. There used to be an industry-based system of minimum wage \nfloors, the Wages Councils, which operated from 1909 to their abolition in 1993. These \nWages Councils covered around 12 percent of the workforce at the time of their abolition. In \nsome earlier work we have studied the impact of the Wages Councils, concluding that their \nactivities did little to harm employment, but that they compressed the wage structures of the \nsectors in which they operated  (Dickens, Machin and Manning, 1999; Dolado et al, 1996). \n Following its election in 1997, Tony Blair\u2019s Labour Government was committed to \nintroducing a National Minimum Wage (as the Labour Party had been in earlier elections that \nthey lost). It set up a Low Pay Commission consisting of academics and representatives of \nemployers and workers to report on a suitable form and level (see Low Pay Commission, \n1998). Eventually, a minimum wage of \u00a33.60 per hour was introduced in April 1999 for those \naged 22 or older, with a lower youth rate of \u00a33 per hour for those aged 18-21 inclusive (those \naged less than 18 were not covered).  The Low Pay Commission expected that around 9 \npercent of workers would be directly affected and those workers would, on average, receive a \n 8 \n30 percent boost to their pay (Metcalf, 1999). These numbers have subsequently been revised \ndown, with it seeming more likely that about 6 percent of workers\u2019 wages were raised up to \nthe minimum (Dickens and Manning, 2002). This, of course, still amounts to a potentially \nlarge impact on the labour market. \nMoreover, it is also clear that there is systematic variation in who benefited from \nminimum wage introduction. Metcalf (1999) also notes the increased importance of the \nminimum wage for part-time female workers. Of the workers he estimates to be directly \naffected by the introduction of the minimum wage, around 55 percent were women working \npart-time. The sector upon which we focus, the care homes sector, and particularly its \nprincipal occupation, that of care assistant, is very female intensive and has many part-time \nworkers. Furthermore, as we will see when we describe our data more fully below, the \nmajority of workers in this sector possess few formal qualifications and wages are very low. \nAs such this is very much a sector that had the potential to be hit hard by the minimum wage. \nThe Labour Market for Care Assistants \n The occupation of care assistant is not only one of the lowest paid occupations5 but \nalso is an increasingly important one in the UK. Indeed, not surprisingly given the aging of \nthe population, the employment of care assistants has risen in recent years in the UK. One can \ngain some idea about the aggregate picture from looking at the number of care assistants in \nthe quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS). Figure I shows total employment of care assistants \nin the private sector between 1994 and 2001.6 The vertical line on the Figure refers to the \ndate of minimum wage introduction. \n The Figure shows a rise in the number of private sector care assistants from around \n220000 in 1994 to 330000 by 2001. But closer scrutiny of the Figure shows that, according to \n                                                          \n5 Taking a look at the occupational breakdowns in the published New Earnings Survey Tables each year \nnormally finds the lowest paid occupation in the UK to be either hairdressers or care assistants. \n 9 \nthese aggregate numbers, there appears to be a moderate slowing down of employment \ngrowth in the later time period after minimum wage introduction. Of course, this can only be \nsuggestive as business cycle factors may be at play here. However, looking at the temporal \npattern of residuals from a regression of care assistant employment on the aggregate \nunemployment rate (or on GDP) still reveals the slower increases occurring post-minimum \nwage introduction (especially into the year 2000).7  \n This is illustrative of general employment trends for care assistants.8 However, to \nproperly consider the question of employment effects of minimum wage introduction in a \nmore systematic and rigorous fashion one really requires micro-data on a big enough sample \nof care assistants before and after minimum wage introduction. This is therefore what we turn \nto next. \n \nIII. Data Issues and Descriptive Statistics    \nMost existing UK data sources are really not well suited to carrying out a detailed before and \nafter evaluation of the economic impact of the introduction of the UK minimum wage.9 We \ntherefore decided to collect our own data. We wanted to focus on a situation where the \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \n6 Each point on Figure corresponds to the mid-month of each LFS quarter (which respectively cover the months \nMarch-May, June-August, September-November, December-February). \n7 Separate regressions of the log of the number care assistants on log(unemployment rate) and log(gdp) \nproduced coefficients (standard errors) of -.68 (.04) and 1.18 (.07). Both regressions had an R-squared of .91. \n8 It also squares up with the demand side in that the size of the older age population was trending upwards as \nwell. For example, the number of people aged 75 and over in the UK rose steadily year on year from 1996 \nonwards as follows: 1996 \u2013 4.17 million; 1997 \u2013 4.24 million; 1998 \u2013 4.29 million; 1999 \u2013 4.33 million; 2000 \u2013 \n4.36 million (Source: Office for National Statistics).  \n9 For example the survey containing the best wage data, and which covers the largest sample of workers, is the \nNew Earnings Survey (NES). This has several serious shortcomings if one wished to try and evaluate the impact \nof minimum wage introduction. First, it is carried out in April of each year which is unfortunate as the minimum \nwage was introduced in April 1999. Wages contained in the survey are therefore a mish mash of pre- and post-\nintroduction wages. Second, and even more important, it undersamples low wage part-time workers (as workers \nbelow the National Insurance weekly earnings lower limit are not well picked up). The other commonly used \nmicro-data suffer from other problems. First most (like the General Household Survey or the Family \nExpenditure Survey) simply do not contain enough low wage workers. Second as they are employee, rather than \nemployer, surveys they are likely to be characterised by measurement errors in wages (see Dickens and \nManning\u2019s, 2002, analysis of Labour Force Survey data).  \n 10 \nminimum wage had the potential to have an important impact and so chose to collect data on \nemployers and workers in residential care homes. \n As already noted, there are several compelling reasons for choosing this sector. First, \nit is a leading employer of many low wage workers. As already noted, the principal \noccupation, care assistants, is one of the lowest paid occupations in the UK. Second, most \nhomes are reasonably small (average employment size < 20; median employment size = 15) \nand this enables us to collect data on all workers within the homes. Third, there are basically \nno trade unions to distort wage-setting procedures in this sector.   \nSample Design  \nOur sample design was to sample the population of UK care homes before and after \nthe introduction of the minimum wage.  We obtained lists of all homes from the Yellow \nPages Business Database in July 1998 (for the pre-minimum sampling) and in May 1999 (for \nthe post-minimum sampling).  There were 11635 care homes in the former and 11036 homes \nin the latter.  As one of the things one might be interested in is the extent to which employers \nadjusted wages before the minimum wage introduction we sampled (based on area \nstratification) one-ninth of the homes in each of the nine months before minimum wage \nintroduction, and then we re-sampled the homes (including new homes), again one-ninth at a \ntime, in the nine months following the introduction of the wage floor. We also identified \nhome closures that occurred over this time period. \n 11 \n The questionnaire was mailed to the manager of the care homes and asked a range of \nquestions about the home and about the views managers (who are often home owners) had \nabout the minimum wage. For obvious reasons, the precise nature of the attitudinal questions \nwas different for questionnaires sent out before and after the introduction of the minimum \nwage.10  Managers were also asked to provide data on job title, sex, age, length of service, \npossession of a nursing qualification, weekly hours and hourly wages for all workers.   \nFor a postal survey we achieved a reasonable response rate (of the order of around 20 \npercent). One may however worry about the representativeness of the achieved sample.  The \nAppendix therefore compares the sample we analyse with data on care assistants from the \nLabour Force Survey. The correspondence is reassuringly very close, giving a lot of \nconfidence that the responses we received are representative, at least in terms of the variables \nwe compare (age, hours, tenure and wages). One should also note that in a small number of \nhomes managers were less likely to complete all the information on worker characteristics. In \nthese cases where there was missing information on hourly wages and\/or hours we imputed \nthem using the average for that job within that firm. We report both results including and \nexcluding imputed figures below. \nDescriptive Statistics \n Some features of the sample are described in Table 1.  The first two columns show the \ncharacteristics of the total sample of workers and homes pre and post minimum wage \nintroduction, the middle two for all homes that we obtained some responses on worker \ncharacteristics in both sampling periods (the balanced panel of homes) and the final two \ncolumns further exclude homes where worker information supplied was very patchy.11   \n                                                          \n10 The actual questionnaires are available on request from the authors. \n11 More specifically we exclude homes where less than half of the workers have missing hours or wage \ninformation. \n 12 \n The Table reveals a number of pertinent features of the labour market under study. \nFirst, and probably most striking, wages really are very low in the care homes sector.  Before \nthe introduction of the minimum wage average wages were about \u00a34 per hour (whether or not \nwe include imputed wages does not make much difference). This sector therefore clearly \nsatisfies one of the criteria we wanted to emphasise in a study of the impact of minimum \nwage introduction, namely that the imposition of the minimum wage floor had the potential \nto affect a large number of workers.  \nThe second clear feature of the wages data is that they rose sharply after minimum \nwage introduction. Average wages went up by somewhere around 24 pence per hour (or by \naround 6 percent). We consider this in much more detail in the next Section where we discuss \nthe \u2018bite\u2019 of the minimum wage introduction. Of course, the requirement that the minimum \nwage introduction significantly affected wages and their distribution is a pre-requisite for \ngoing on to look at employment effects. \n The Table also documents other characteristics of the sample. Average home size is \nfairly small, both in terms of workers and residents. Mean employment is in the range of 16 \nto 17 workers, and the average number of residents is around 17 to 18 per home.  They both \nremain fairly constant before and after the minimum wage introduction. \n As stated earlier the principal occupation in this sector is care assistants. This \noccupational group comprises over 60 percent of the workers in the sample. The workers are \ntypically older workers (average age about 40), overwhelmingly female, working an average \nof 25 hours per week. Only around 1 in 10 possess a nursing qualification (other educational \nqualifications are not relevant in this sector).   \n Finally, we have collected other home level information on the occupancy rate of beds \nand, since the sector has price regulation operating through local authorities, on the percent of \nresidents who pay local authority prices for beds. This latter feature of the sector is, of course, \n 13 \nvery interesting in the context of minimum wage effects. One argument sometimes put \nforward in the literature is that one may not observe employment responses to minimum \nwages if employers are able to pass minimum wage increases on to consumers in the form of \nhigher prices. This seems unlikely to happen in the care homes sector as prices are, in many \ncases, regulated by local authorities. We return to look at possible price responses later, after \nconsidering the wage and employment effects of the minimum wage introduction. \n    \nIV. Wages and the Minimum Wage \nBefore considering the employment consequences of minimum wage introduction, one \nclearly needs to establish that the minimum wage had the effect one expects on wages and the \ndistribution of wages. As noted above, confirming that the minimum wage introduction had \nreal \u2018bite\u2019 and affected the wages of low wage workers in the expected direction is clearly a \nprerequisite before one goes on to look at the impact on employment. \nThe \u2018Bite\u2019 of The Minimum Wage Introduction  \nThe UK National Minimum Wage was introduced in April 1999 at \u00a33.60 per hour for \nworkers aged 22 or more, and at \u00a33.00 per hour for 18-21 year olds. When presenting \nmeasures of the impact of the minimum wage we sometimes use these age-specific minimum \nwages and sometimes just the adult minimum: the reason for this is that there is a spike in the \nyouth wage distribution at the adult minimum after the introduction so that one could argue \nthat the adult minimum is the effective minimum.12  \nTable 2 reports on our investigations of the impact of minimum wage introduction on \nwages. The numbers in the Table demonstrate a clear importance of minimum wage \nintroduction for care home workers. The Table shows the percentage of workers paid less \nthan the minimum wage prior to its introduction, how far wages would have to be increased if \n                                                          \n12 See Katz and Krueger (1992) for evidence that in the US the youth sub-minimum is rarely used.  \n 14 \nthese workers\u2019 wages were raised to the minimum and the percentage paid at exactly the \nminimum (the size of the minimum wage spike in the wage distribution). As with Table 1 \nstatistics are reported for all care homes, for the balanced panel and then for the balanced \npanel that excludes homes with limited worker information. \nThe first thing to notice in the Table is that the sector we are studying is one that, \nconditional on the minimum wage introduction being binding, had the potential to be very \nheavily affected by the national minimum wage. Around 32 percent of workers were paid \nbelow the (age-specific) minimum wage before it was introduced. Around 38 percent were \npaid below the adult minimum rate. \nTable 2 also presents measures of the \u2018wage gap\u2019, namely the average increase in \nwages needed to bring workers beneath the mandated minimum up to the minimum.  The \nwage gap in firm i is computed as \n\u2211\n\u2211 \u2212\n=\nj\njiji\nj\nji\nmin\njiji\ni Wh\n)0,Wmax(Wh\nGAP where hji is the weekly \nhours worked by worker j in firm i, Wji is the hourly wage of worker j in firm i, and Wjimin is \nthe minimum wage relevant for worker j in firm i (this might be the age-specific or the adult \nminimum). Table 2 shows that the wage gap averages 4 percent using the age-specific \nminimum and 4.7 percent using the adult minimum. Again this confirms a potentially very \nlarge impact of the minimum wage introduction on the sector. \nThat the minimum wage impacted hard on the wage structure of care homes is borne \nout by looking at the post-minimum columns of the Table. First, there seems to be very little \nunder-payment (around 1 percent for all homes or slightly lower in the balanced panels).  \nHowever, something one might be concerned about here is that firms that subsequently pay \nillegally below the minimum wage do not respond to our survey. But were this to be true we \nwould expect to see the initial wage levels in our sample as a whole being below those in the \nbalanced panel as the latter homes respond to the survey both before and after the minimum \n 15 \nwage was introduced. However, Table 1 shows initial pre-minimum wage introduction wages \nto actually be slightly higher in the full sample as compared to the balanced panel, so there is \nno evidence that this is the case.13  \nThe second feature of Table 2 that shows the minimum wage \u2018bit\u2019 hard is the very \nnoticeable spike at the minimum after April 1999.  Something like 28 or 29 percent of \nworkers were paid the age-specific minimum after introduction and around 30 to 31 percent \nwere paid the adult minimum. One should notice here that the spike is measured at exactly \nthe minimum wage (not as plus or minus a small range around the minimum as in some other \nstudies). \nNot surprisingly the minimum wage introduction therefore had a sizable impact on \nwage dispersion. The gap between the 50th and 10th percentiles of the log(hourly wage) \ndistribution narrowed from .21 to .09. At the same time the upper half of the distribution was \nunaffected with the gap between the 90th and 50th percentiles of the distribution not changing. \nThe 90-50 gap was .34 in both pre- and post-minimum time periods.14   \nMinimum Wage Introduction and Care Home Wages \nThe numbers in Table 2 show a strong impact of minimum wage introduction on the \ncare homes wage distribution. But, for our empirical analysis, we would also like evidence \nthat the homes we would most expect to be affected were, indeed, the most affected.  This is \nthe purpose of this sub-section.  More specifically the basic wage change equations we \nestimate are of the form: \n\u2206lnWit  = \u03b11+ \u03b21MINi,t-1 + \u03b41Xi,t-1 + \u03b5it    (1) \nwhere \u2206lnWit is the change in wages for home i in the period surrounding minimum wage \nintroduction (t-1 denotes the period before, t the post-minimum period), MINi, t-1 is a measure \n                                                          \n13 We also investigated whether the sample response rates fell disproportionately in the low-wage regions where \nthe minimum wage had more bite.  There was no evidence of this either. \n 16 \nof the importance of the minimum wage for home i (defined below), Xi,t-1 is the (t-1) level \nhome and worker characteristics15 and \u03b5it is an error term. The key parameter of interest is \u03b21 \nwhich measures the relation between wage changes and the minimum holding constant the \nother factors we control for. \n There are some practical concerns with this kind of equation. The first issue is how \none measures MINi, t-1. We use the two measures of the impact of the minimum wage already \ndiscussed in Table 2: the proportion of workers paid less than the minimum wage in the \nperiod before its introduction, and the wage gap.  It is not clear which is the better measure. \nFor example, if the minimum wage caused all workers initially paid below it to lose their \njobs, then the headcount might be the better measure, but if it is more difficult to raise the \nproductivity of those a long way below the minimum wage than those near it, then the wage \ngap measure might be better. \n The second main modeling issue concerns identification. Because the minimum wage \nintroduction in the UK was at national level the variation across homes in the impact of the \nminimum wage all comes from variation in the initial level of wages. \u03b21 is then only a true \nmeasure of the impact of the minimum wage if, in the absence of the minimum wage, there \nwould be no relationship between the initial level of wages and the change in wages (i.e. if \nwages follow a random walk). This is the implicit identification assumption in using an \nequation like (1) to estimate the impact of the minimum wage.  \nWe test this identifying assumption in two related ways that consider whether the \nrelationship between wage changes and their initial level shifted in the period surrounding \nminimum wage introduction relative to an earlier period when no minimum wage was in \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \n14 See Dickens and Manning (2002) for an in-depth analysis of the impact of minimum wage introduction on \nwage inequality in the UK. \n15 We also considered models where, rather than entering the initial period home and worker characteristics as \ncontrols,  the change in X, \u2206Xit, was entered. This made very little difference to the reported pattern of results \nthroughout our analysis. \n 17 \nplace. We first look at the relationship between wage changes and initial wages in the \nminimum wage introduction period (1998\/99) as compared to the relationship estimated from \nsome data we collected in an earlier time period (1992\/93) for care homes on the south coast \nof England.16 Second we consider whether the relationship between wage changes and the \nminimum wage variable altered across these two time periods by constructing a counter-\nfactual minimum wage variable (placing the minimum at the same percentile point of the \ninitial wage distribution17) in the earlier non-minimum wage time period.  We do this for both \nthe headcount and wage gap measures. The two approaches thereby enable us to consider \nwhether one observes a different association in the period surrounding minimum wage \nintroduction as compared to an earlier time period where no such policy was in place. \nEstimates of Wage Change Equations \nTable 3 reports estimates of home-level wage change equations for hourly wages \n(upper panel) and for weekly wages (lower panel) in the period surrounding minimum wage \nintroduction. Four specifications are reported in each case. Rows (1) and (2) present estimates \nof wage equations including the initial low pay proportion to measure MINi, t-1. They differ in \nthat the first specification excludes and the second specification includes a set of control \nvariables. Rows (3) and (4) then present analogous specifications using the wage gap measure \nas an independent variable.  \nIn all cases there is evidence of bigger wage increases in homes with more low-wage \nworkers in the pre-minimum wage period. The associations are strong in statistical terms and \nare sizable. They also look rather similar for hourly and weekly wages. For example, \n                                                          \n16  See Machin, Manning and Woodland (1993) for more detail on this earlier survey and Machin and Manning \n(2002) for an analysis of wage structure in care homes in the earlier time period. This 1992\/93 survey was \ncarried out for the same reason as the current one, namely to evaluate the impact of minimum wage introduction \non care homes.  The first wave of the survey was carried out before the April 1992 election as the Labour Party \nmanifesto had committed to introduce a minimum wage if they were elected.  Their loss of the election meant \nour plan to carry out a before and after analysis of minimum wage introduction was scuppered. We still, \nhowever, collected data after the election period and so can look at before and after changes with these data as \nwell. \n 18 \naccording to row (2) of the upper panel of Table 3 a home with one third of its workers paid \nless than the minimum saw average wage growth of 3.3 percent higher than one which had \none tenth of its workers paid less than the minimum.18 This is large given that average wage \ngrowth was around 6 percent in this time period \n These results appear to establish an important impact on wages of the minimum wage \nbut, as noted above, it may merely be because there has always been a link between wage \ngrowth and initial low pay. So we investigate this in some detail in Table 4. We do so in the \ntwo main ways already mentioned above. First, we estimate equations relating wage change \nto the initial period average wage in the periods surrounding minimum wage introduction and \nin the earlier 1992\/93 time period for which we have data where no minimum wage was in \nplace. This equation takes the form: \n \u2206lnWit  = \u03b12 + \u03b22lnWi,t-1 + \u03c5it     (2) \nwhere the focus is now on estimating the association between wage changes and the initial \naverage wage, namely the parameter \u03b22  (\u03c5 is an error term). \n The second way in which we benchmark our results against the earlier time period is \nto return to equation (1) and specify a counter-factual minimum wage in the earlier non-\nminimum wage period so as to compute measures of the initial low pay proportion and wage \ngap variables. We do so by placing this counter-factual minimum at the same percentile point \nof the wage distribution. \n Table 4 reports these results for hourly wages. For all three specifications there is a \nclear shift in the relationship between wage changes and the initial wage measures in the \nperiod surrounding minimum wage introduction as compared to the earlier time period. The \nsignificantly negative coefficient on the initial wage in the 1998\/99 model in row (1) of the \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \n17  This corresponds to \u00a32.75 per hour. \n18  The calculation is .145*(.33 - .10) = .033. \n 19 \nTable demonstrates very clearly that, in the period surrounding minimum wage introduction, \nwage growth was higher in firms with lower wages in the initial period.  In the earlier non-\nminimum wage period (1992\/93) there is also a negative coefficient on the initial wage, but it \nis clear that its magnitude is much smaller (in absolute terms) than in 1998\/99.  The final \ncolumn reports the gap between the two and it is very clear that the relationship shifted \nmarkedly between the two time periods. \n Some graphs also serve to make the same point.  Figure 2a plots the relationship \nbetween average wage growth and the initial log wage in 1998\/99 and Figure 2b does the \nsame for the 1992\/93 data.  While it is very clear that there is a negative relationship in both \nperiods, the strong diagonal effect on homes with initial low wages is very apparent in the \n1998\/99 data.  This reveals a clear impact of the minimum wage. \n In rows (2) and (3) of Table 4 we also report results of wage growth equations \nincluding the initial minimum wage variables for the 1998\/99 data and the counter-factual \ninitial minimum wage variables for the 1992\/93 data. These very much reconfirm the pattern \nfrom the row (1) models. There is a marked shift between periods for both measures as one \ncan see a much stronger positive impact of the initial minimum wage variables in the period \nsurrounding minimum wage introduction. Indeed, there is no relationship between wage \nchanges and the initial low pay proportion in the earlier non-minimum wage period and a \nmuch smaller association with the initial wage gap measure. This shift is borne out by the \npositive, statistically significant gaps given in the final column of the Table. \nAll in all, the evidence of this Section has established a clear and important effect of \nminimum wage introduction on care home wages. We turn to investigate the possible \nemployment effects in the next section. \n \n \n 20 \n \nV. Employment and the Minimum Wage \nWe analyse the employment consequences of the minimum wage introduction using \nthe same kind of methodology as the wage analysis. We estimate home-level equations that \nrelate changes in employment or hours in the period surrounding minimum wage introduction \nto headcount and wage measures of the extent of initial low pay. And, because of the \nidentification questions already raised, we look at the relationship between changes in \nemployment and initial wage levels in the period of minimum wage introduction and the \nperiod where no minimum wage was in place. We begin with the latter in the next sub-\nsection, and then move on to the former after that. \nChanges in Employment and Initial Wages \nAs before, the implicit identification assumption here is that, in the absence of the \nminimum wage, there would be no relationship between employment growth and the initial \nlevel of wages.  It is not obvious this is the case (e.g. homes that are doing less well might \npay lower wages and have lower employment growth) so we start by investigating the \nrelationship between employment growth and initial wages. \nTable 5 reports the results of carrying out this exercise for the period surrounding \nminimum wage introduction (1998\/99) and for the earlier period (1992\/93) where no such \npolicy intervention occurred. The upper panel of the Table reports models where changes in \nlog total employment are related to the initial period wage measures, whilst the lower panel \nreports results where the dependent variable is the change in log total hours. \n The first thing to note is that the correlations of employment changes with initial wage \nmeasures tend to be weaker than the correlations with wage changes considered earlier. That \nsaid, there is some evidence (of varying strength depending on specification) of shifts \noccurring between the \u2018policy on\u2019 and \u2018policy off\u2019 time periods. In all cases but one, the sign \n 21 \nof the relationship switches between periods, revealing a tilt in the relationship so that, in the \nperiod surrounding minimum wage introduction, employment growth tended to be reduced in \nhomes that were impacted more by minimum wage introduction. And some of the gaps in the \nfinal column are statistically significant (or on the borders of significance, the one exception \nbeing the initial period low proportion in the upper panel of the Table). We take this as some \npreliminary evidence that the relationship between employment and low wages may have \nshifted in the period surrounding minimum wages. \nChanges in Employment And Initial Minimum Wage Variables \nIn this sub-section we consider in more detail the relationship between home-level \nemployment and hours changes and the minimum wage variables in the period surrounding \nminimum wage introduction. Figures 3 and 4 plot the basic data we use to look at these. The \nchange in log total employment is plotted against the initial proportion low-paid in Figure 3a \nand against the initial wage-gap in 3b.  Figures 4a and 4b do the same but with the change in \nlog total hours on the left-hand axis.  Eyeballing these scatterplots does not reveal any distinct \npattern, despite the very clear wage evidence presented earlier. \nIn the first instance we estimate reduced form employment change equations of the \nform: \n \u2206lnNit  = \u03b13 + \u03b23 MINi,t-1 + \u03b43Xi,t-1 + \u03b6it    (3) \nVarious estimates of equation (3) are given in columns (1) through (6) of Table 6, for \nchanges in total employment in the upper panel and for changes in total hours in the lower \npanel of the Table. In the final two columns of the Table we also present structural estimates \nof labour demand equations from a simple structural model of the following form (equation \n(1) is reproduced from above): \n \u2206lnNit  = \u03b14 + \u03b24 \u2206lnWit  + \u03b44Xi,t-1 + \u03c9it    (4) \n\u2206lnWit  = \u03b11+ \u03b21MINi,t-1 + \u03b41Xi,t-1 + \u03b5it    (1) \n 22 \nWe are able to estimate \u03b24, the wage elasticity of labour demand, by using MINi,t-1 as an \ninstrumental variable for the wage change (equation (1) can thus be thought of as the first \nstage regression in the IV procedure). It is also straightforward to see how this relates to the \nreduced form models (1) and (3) where the labour demand elasticity \u03b24 is given by \u03b23\/\u03b21. \n Turning to the results in the Table, columns (1) and (4) report the coefficient on the \ninitial low pay proportion and the initial wage gap respectively in a regression where the \ndependent variable is the change in log employment or log hours and there are no other \ncontrols. In these basic models the estimated impact of the minimum wage is negative, \nthough not significantly different from zero. However the addition of controls and restriction \nof the sample to those with relatively complete information on worker characteristics \n(columns (2) and (3) for the headcount, columns (5) and (6) for the wage gap) makes the \ncoefficients both larger in absolute terms and more significant.  In these specifications we are \nable to pin down a significant negative effect on employment growth.   \nThe Table also reports implicit elasticities calculated on the basis of a minimum wage \nincrease of 40p (the adult rate going from \u00a33.60 to \u00a34.00).  These ask the question: what \nwould the additional effect on employment have been if the minimum wage had been \nintroduced at a higher level? In the models with controls these elasticities are in the range of \n\u2013.15 to \u2013.40. These are reasonably sizable in the context of the minimum wage literature, \nthough are not so big given the very large impact of minimum wage introduction on the \nwages and wage distribution of care home workers.   \nThe other, related, way to look at the employment response to wage changes is to \ndirectly compute the elasticity of employment with respect to the wage, using the initial wage \ngap variable as an instrument for the change in average wages. Structural estimates of \nemployment change equations are reported in columns (7) and (8). They reveal a well \n 23 \ndetermined negative wage effect that is moderate in size19, ranging from about -.35 to -.55, \ndepending on the specification.  \nOne issue of possible importance is the speed at which employers may adjust in \nresponse to minimum wages. It is hard to do anything very convincing here given we only \nfollow homes nine months before and after minimum wage introduction. But, from what we \ncan look at, it seems that wage adjustment was very rapid and the wages clearly adjusted at \nthe time of introduction and barely at all before (i.e. there seems no evidence of \u2018anticipation\u2019 \neffects on wages). Employment adjustment may be slower, but one should note that this is a \nvery high employee turnover sector (presumably in part due to the very low wages). \nFurthermore a study of what happened to wages and employment in care homes before and \nafter the more recent uprating of the minimum wage (up to \u00a34.10 for adults and \u00a33.50 for 18-\n21 year olds in October 2001) finds employment effects of much the same magnitude, and no \nstronger, than those reported here (Allison, 2002). \n While the estimated employment effects are clearly not as strong as the wage effects \nconsidered in the previous section of the paper, they do suggest that employers cut \nemployment and hours in response to the minimum wage.20 One might wonder how this is \npossible in this sector as these firms are regulated and there are minimum standards of care \nfor the residents that are mandated. However, inspection of these homes is far from perfect \nand the sector is notorious for examples of homeowners providing inadequate standards of \ncare (for example, they have been the subject of several TV documentaries). It seems \n                                                          \n19  See Hamermesh (1993) for a very detailed consideration of the large body of work that estimates labour \ndemand elasticities. \n20 The analysis is based upon the balanced panel of homes. Given our data we can also look at closures, \nalthough only in the window very recently after minimum wage introduction (since our second wave is based on \na sample of homes in May 1999). Running probit models of closure on the two minimum wage variables, and \neither including or excluding the control variables, resulted in positive, but very small estimated marginal effects \n(all of which were statistically insignificant). Whilst it is clear that effects may differ if one looks at a longer \nperiod, this short run analysis finds no evidence that rising wage costs ensuing from minimum wage \nintroduction resulted in home closure. The same conclusions were reached for a county-level analysis of entry \n 24 \nplausible that managers face a trade-off between the fraction of the time they are in breach of \ncare guidelines (which is determined by employment) and the probability of being fined \nwhen inspected in that situation. In addition, owner-managers often work considerable hours \nin the homes themselves and may have the ability to substitute their labour for that of paid \nhelp. \nOther Outcomes and the Minimum Wage \nThis section briefly investigates the impact of the minimum wage on other outcomes.  \nIt is possible that they may have \u2018passed on\u2019 increased wage costs from the minimum wage \nintroduction through higher prices though the extent to which this is possible may be limited \nby the price regulation in place.  Second, there may have had to be re-organizations that could \nraise productivity (e.g. quality of care improvements, or increases in care worker \nproductivity, or simply making people work harder for their higher wages). \nWe consider these possibilities in Table 7. The upper panel reports price change \nequations and the lower two panels consider two productivity measures, using the same kind \nof models as for wages and employment. The first productivity measure used is changes in \nresidents per worker hour, the second comes from managers\u2019 responses to a question about \nwhether they think worker effort went up, stayed the same, or fell in the period around \nminimum wage introduction. \nPerhaps not surprisingly given the nature of price regulation in the care homes sector \nwe find no evidence that prices rose by more in the initial low wage firms.  All the estimated \ncoefficients in the upper panel are small and none of the coefficients approach anything near \nstatistical significance (all have t-ratios < 1).  As such there seems to be no evidence that \nminimum wage increases might have been passed on through higher prices in this sector. \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \nand closure using Labour Force Survey data. All of these results are presented in the earlier Discussion Paper \nversion of this paper (Machin, Manning and Rahman, 2002). \n 25 \nThere is also not much evidence in line with the re-organization\/productivity \nimprovement idea considered in the lower panels of Table 9. While the estimated coefficients \non the minimum wage variables in both the change in residents per worker hour and \nsubjective effort change equations are all estimated to be positive, none are significantly \ndifferent from zero when the control variables are included.  \n  \nVI. Conclusions \nIn this paper we have presented empirical work on the wage and employment consequences \nof the recent introduction of the UK national minimum wage for a specific sector of the UK \nlabour market. As we argued in the introduction to the paper we think examination of the \neconomic effects of this minimum wage introduction provides a good testing ground for \nlooking at minimum wage effects and provides an ideal opportunity for presenting some fresh \nevidence on the debate about what minimum wages do. We implement our empirical study \nby focusing on workers in the care homes industry, a low wage sector that was highly \nvulnerable to minimum wage introduction. In the absence of suitable data from existing \nsources we chose to examine the minimum wage impact by carrying out our own survey \nbefore and after the minimum wage was introduced.  \nFrom our analysis of these data we find there to have been a very important wage \ncompression effect on the bottom half of the wage distribution in this low wage sector. \nBefore its introduction around 1 in 3 care home workers were paid less than the minimum \nwage. In April 1999 we see a spike in the wage distribution of around 30 percent at exactly \nthe minimum wage (and little evidence of non-compliance). This resulted in wage growth \nbeing considerably higher in the period surrounding minimum wage workers in homes who \nhad more low-paid workers before the minimum came in.  This seems to establish that the \n 26 \nminimum wage had considerable \u2018bite\u2019 on wages and this substantially altered the structure \nof wages of this sector. \nTurning to the employment consequences, we are able to find some evidence of \nemployment and hours reductions occurring in homes after minimum wage introduction. This \nseems to be in line with the aggregate behaviour of the labour market for care assistants, \nwhere the fast employment increases of the pre-minimum wage period slowed down in 1999 \nand 2000.  \nOf course, one should be very careful to note that the sector we have examined is \nparticularly vulnerable to the minimum wage as it has very many low-paid workers. It is also \nrather special in that its product market structure means homes are constrained in their ability \nto pass higher wage costs on into higher prices. Given this, and the fact that studies of the \nimpact of minimum wage introduction on the overall UK labour market uncover little \nevidence of job loss (Stewart, 2001), one should remain cautious in drawing conclusions \nfrom this study about the impact of the introduction of the National Minimum Wage on the \nUK as a whole. \n 27 \nReferences  \nAllison, Nicola (2002) The Effect of the National Minimum Wage in the UK, unpublished \nMSc Dissertation, University College London. \n \nBrown, Charles (1999) Minimum Wages, Employment, and the Distribution of Income, \nChapter 32 in Orley Ashenfelter and David Card (eds.)

For the LFS, we report results for \nprivate-sector workers in the \u2018industry\u2019 \u2018social work with accommodation\u2019 (class 85.31), \nwhose occupation is \u2018care assistants and attendants\u2019.  The LFS sample comes from March \n1998 to February 2000 so approximately coincides with the period of our survey. \n \nIn the Table below we report selected percentiles of the distribution of the characteristics of \ncare assistants in our sample and in the LFS.  We have information on age, hours, job tenure \nand hourly wages.  For age, hours and job tenure there is no problem in comparing the \nvariables in our sample and the LFS and the sample sizes are both large.  As can be seen from \nthe Table, the distributions are remarkably similar. \n \nThe comparison of the distribution of hourly wages is made more difficult by deficiencies in \nthe LFS data that lead to small sample sizes.  First, wage information is only collected in \nwaves 1 and 5 (out of 5) so is automatically missing for 60% of observations.  Secondly, the \nmain LFS pay variable (which is derived by dividing weekly wages by weekly hours) is now \nrecognized to have very large amount of measurement error and its use led to a wild over-\nestimate of the numbers of workers who were affected by the minimum wage (see Dickens \nand Manning, 2002).  In March 1999 it was supplemented by a direct measure of the hourly \nwage for hourly-paid workers: this measure has less measurement error but is not observed \nfor all workers (for our sample here it is 50%). \n \nAs a result of this we only have 167 observations in the LFS on the good measure of the \nhourly wage.  The distribution of this variable is reported in the Table below in the row \nlabelled LFS(1).  Its distribution is similar to that in our sample (we restrict ourselves here to \nthe post-NMW period as this is the only period for which we have the LFS (1) measure).  \nOne other concern is that those who report an hourly rate in the LFS are not randomly \nselected.  A number of methods for dealing with this have been proposed (see Dickens and \nManning, 2002, for a discussion).  Here we report the results using an inverse propensity \nscore re-weighting in the row labelled LFS(2).  For our sample, probably because they are so \nhomogeneous, the re-weighted distribution is very similar to the unweighted distribution. \n \nAll of this evidence suggests that we do not have a problem with the representativeness of our \nsample. In fact the survey and LFS summary statistics square up exceptionally well. \n \n Sample 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th Observations \n          \nAge Ours 18 20 27 37 48 56 60 39316 \nLFS 18 20 26 36 49 55 59 3218 \n          \nWeekly \nHours \nOurs 9 12 18.5 26 35 39 40 39624 \nLFS 10 14 20 30 36 40 42 3188 \n          \nTenure \n(months) \nOurs 2 4 12 24 60 108 132 39905 \nLFS 2 3 9 25 60 108 132 3205 \n 41 \n          \nHourly \nWage \nOurs 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.80 4.25 5.04 5.57 21313 \nLFS(1) 3.3 3.6 3.6 3.77 4.20 4.75 5.00 167 \nLFS(2) 3.3 3.6 3.6 3.77 4.15 4.70 5.00 166 \n \n \n"}
