Average time per day online: Respondents estimated time spent online on a typical weekday and weekend day.

This article, based on the \n\u2018UK Children Go Online\u2019 survey, seeks to explain the online communication of  9 \u2013 19 year olds in \nterms of their offline socio-psychological characteristics (shyness, life satisfaction, risk-taking), \nfamily communication patterns and online behaviour\/skills.Findings show that older teens engage \nin more online communication activities than do younger children and so encounter more \ncommunication risks. Although girls communicate more on the internet, this seems not to put them \nmore at risk. It was found that children\u2019s offline social psychological characteristics, particularly \ntheir levels of life satisfaction and risk-taking, influence their online communication, with different \nonline communication activities being predicted by different patterns of off and online \ncharacteristics. There are weak indications that, in families which have a more conversational style \nof communication, teens may take fewer risks online, including a lower likelihood of meeting online \nfriends offline. Multiple regression analyses show that those children and teens who are less \nsatisfied with their lives and who have become more frequent and skilled internet users are more \nlikely to value the internet as a communicative environment in which they feel more confident than \nthey do offline, particularly in relation to the potential for anonymous communication. Since this in \nturn leads some into risky activities, the implications for research and policy are discussed. \n \nKeywords Children and young people, online communication, contact risks, anonymity, trust \n \n 1\n 2\nOnline opportunities and risks \n \nThe internet is widely recognised as affording both opportunities and risks to those who use it, \nalthough the balance between the opportunities and risks, and the question of whether the internet \nincreases the overall likelihood of children encountering risks such as paedophile contact, stalking, \nbullying or race hate is unresolved (Livingstone, 2001; Seiter, 2005; Valkenburg & Soeters, 2001). \nWhile overall evaluations remain elusive, the notions of internet \u2018uses\u2019 and \u2018users\u2019 must be \ndisaggregated: different internet users, depending on their social contexts, will take up distinct \nfunctionalities of the internet (LaRose et al., 2001) and so, in consequence, will encounter different \nopportunities and risks.  \nWhile a considerable body of research has sought to identify the many and various benefits \nafforded by internet communication, especially for young people (e.g. Clark, 2005; Leung, 2001; \nPew, 2001), others have more pessimistically drawn attention to the risks. Concerns arise in \nrelation to children and young people regarding the risk of encountering commercial content, \npornographic content and violent content (Greenfield, 2004; Larsson, 2003; Livingstone & Bober, in \npress; Mitchell, Finkelhor, & Wolak, 2003; Montgomery, 2001). However, it is the potential of the \ninternet for peer-to-peer networking that arouses the greatest anxieties among those concerned \nwith youth safety (Muir, 2005). In acknowledgment of the widespread public concern attaching \nespecially to the risks of meeting strangers online and then offline (Carr, 2004; Internet Crime \nForum, 2000), and notwithstanding the many benefits that the internet undoubtedly affords young \npeople, this article focuses on the risks that children and young people may encounter as they use \nthe internet to communicate with peers, including giving out personal information, making friends \nonline and going to offline meetings with people met online (c.f. Larsson, 2003; Liau, et al, 2005; \nTurow & Nir, 2000). Thus, it asks which young people are taking up the opportunity to \ncommunicate on the internet, why, and with what consequences? \n \n \n \nUsing the internet to communicate \n \nTo understand what goes on online, it is important to grasp what goes on offline, for there is no \neasy assumption of difference or opposition between these two spheres of communication \n(McGerty, 2000; Slater, 2002). Indeed, it is increasingly argued that the social relationships \nmediated by computers and the internet reflect, or are continuous with, the relationships people \nhave offline (Spears, Postmes, Wolbert, Lea, & Rogers, 2000; Walther, 1996; Wellman, Quan \nHaase, Witte, & Hampton, 2001). For example, precisely because women are regarded as better \ncommunicators offline, it has been hypothesised that they will use the internet more to \ncommunicate and will feel more comfortable using it as a communication tool (Singh, 2001; \nWeiser, 2000). We note, however, that empirical research sometimes (Boneva, Kraut, & Frohlich, \n2001), but not always, supports this claim (Shaw & Grant, 2002).  Partly, this is a matter of \nresearch measures. For example, in the case of gender, Hargittai and Shafer (2006) found that \nwomen tend to self-assess their internet skills as lower than do men, and this may negatively affect \nthe extent and breadth of their internet uses; yet their research also shows that women\u2019s actual \nonline skills are little different from men\u2019s. However, in relation to communication in particular, \nwomen and, especially, teenage girls, appear to make greater use of the internet (Raphael, \nBachen, Lynn, Baldwin-Philippi, & McKee, 2006). While in many ways this is beneficial, it is also \nthe case that girls are more likely to experience the risks of online communication, for example by \nreceiving more online sexual solicitations (Mitchell, Finkelhor & Wolak, 2003). \nIn a parallel debate, some have suggested internet use to be associated with isolation and \nloneliness, the online apparently compensating for difficulties (whether social or psychological) \noffline (Kraut et al., 1998). Although subsequent research has instead found it to support an \nexpansion in social networks (Bakardjieva, 2003; Kraut et al., 2002; Mesch, 2001), albeit through \nweak ties (Hampton & Wellman, 2003), nonetheless, concerns remain over whether internet use is \nassociated with social isolation (Griffiths, Davies, & Chappell, 2004; Nie, 2001). Thus research \nprovides indications that those who lack strong relationships offline will seek them online \n(McKenna & Bargh, 1998), that use of the internet for sociability and self-disclosure is inversely \n 3\nlinked to satisfaction and quality of life (Leung & Lee, 2005 \u2013 as are many other aspects of young \npeople\u2019s lives, see Huebner, 2001), and that using the internet increases loneliness and \ndepression among those who are not psychologically stable (Bessiere, Kiesler, Kraut, & Boneva, \n2005; Subrahmanyam, Kraut, Greenfield, & Gross, 2000). While it is not always possible to \ndetermine the direction of causality underlying these observed associations (Kraut, Kiesler, \nBoneva, & Shklovski, 2006), in a longitudinal study, Jackson et al (2001) found that depressed \npeople make greater use of email and that, in addition, using email seems to lessen (rather than \nincrease) feelings of loneliness. \nFocusing specifically on youth, an American survey of 7th grade children (c.12 years old) \nfound no relation \u2013 neither positive nor negative - between time spent online and well-being in \ngeneral, but it did find that those who felt lonely or socially anxious were more likely to use instant \nmessaging to communication with people they did not know well (Gross, Juvonen, & Gable, 2002). \nSimilarly, a large American survey of 9th-grade (c.14 year old) students found that use of internet \nchat rooms was associated with greater likelihood of psychological distress, a difficult living \nenvironment and risky behaviours (Beebe, Asche, Harrison, & Quinlan, 2004). More positively, \nMesch and Talmud (n.d.) found that, among Israeli adolescents, those who lack social support \noffline (but not those with low self-esteem offline) may compensate by developing strong and \nmeaningful friendships online, particularly with others who are similar to them (Mesch & Talmud, in \npress). \nThese continuities between offline and online may not only derive from social psychological \ncharacteristics such as shyness or lack of life satisfaction.  Research on media effects (Bryant & \nZillman, 2002) suggests, for example, that those who seek risks (or sensation) in everyday life tend \nto seek the same kind of stimulation in the media. It may be, therefore, that those who take risks \noffline will do the same online, a hypothesis particularly apposite to our present concern, since \nmaking friends online and, especially, meeting them offline are often framed as risky activities, \nparticularly in policy debates over online safety, and so may well be undertaken by risk-takers or \nsensation-seekers. Slater, Henry, Swaim, and Cardador (2004, p.644) define \u2018sensation-seeking\u2019 \nas \u2018a dispositional tendency to seek out novelty and accept risk as a desirable source of arousal\u2019. \nWhile this definition is itself neutral, we are here concerned with the possibly negative, rather than \nbeneficial, consequences of such a tendency. \nImportantly, the consequences of online relationships are not always easy to judge, though \nthere are indications that for most, online communication may be positive, enabling beneficial \nonline relationships, but for those who are in some way psychologically vulnerable, online \ncommunication may be harmful or risky. One major American survey, which found that teens who \nlack good communication with their peers or parents offline are more likely to form close online \nrelationships (Wolak, Mitchell, & Finkelhor, 2003), speculated that for some, these relationships \nmay be beneficial, while for others they may be risky. Surveys also show that parents are often \nunaware of, and ineffectual regarding, the risks their children take online, raising crucial questions \nregarding the quality of communication between parents and children in mediating children\u2019s online \ncommunication (Larsson, 2003; Liau, et al, 2005; Livingstone & Bober, in press). Thus the quality \nof children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 communication with their parents seems to be a relevant social \ncontext worth investigating (Fitzpatrick, et al, 1996), especially since in policy circles, so much \nsafety awareness material is targeted at parents. In addition to research on whether online \ncommunication is a cause of, or a response to, the social psychological problems in children\u2019s \noffline lives, there is also a growing literature charting the specific risks introduced by online \ncommunication. The \u2018Youth Internet Safety Survey\u2019, based on 1,501 10 to 17 year olds in the USA \nwho use the Internet regularly (Finkelhor, Mitchell, & Wolak, 2000), found that one in five had \nreceived a sexual solicitation or approach over the internet in the last year, one in 17 had been \nthreatened or harassed, and one in 33 received an aggressive sexual solicitation, often from \nsomeone who asked to meet them, telephoned them, or sent them regular mail, money or gifts. \nAlthough around one quarter had been distressed by these incidents, few reported them to a \nparent, law-enforcement agency or internet service provider (see also Livingstone & Bober, \n2004b). \nOther surveys, often among students, reveal the growing incidence of cyber-harassment and \ncyber-stalking (Barak, 2005; Bocij, 2003), online bullying (Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004) and hostile or \nembarrassing messaging. The \u2018UK Children Go Online\u2019 survey found that one third of 9-19 year old \ninternet users have received unwanted sexual (31%) or nasty\/bullying comments (33%) via email, \n 4\nchat, instant message or text message (Livingstone & Bober, 2004b). Girls seem more vulnerable \nthan boys to such behaviour online: 33% of the girls had received sexual comments compared with \n29% of boys; the difference for bullying was even greater - 38% of girls have been bullied \ncompared with 27% of boys. As further analysis of that survey also showed, more frequent and \nmore skilled internet users encounter a greater range of online risks as well as opportunities \n(Livingstone, Bober, & Helsper, 2005): 38% of daily users had received sexual comments and had \nbeen bullied while only 25% of weekly users had received sexual comments and 27% had been \nbullied. \nLittle is yet known of how people cope with online threats, though it seems that many lack the \nrequisite skills (Bocij, 2003). Ybarra (2004) found not only that 10-17 year olds who reported major \ndepressive-like symptoms were 3.5 times more likely also to report an unwanted sexual solicitation \nonline compared to youths with mild\/no symptoms, but also that, among those reporting an online \nsolicitation, youths with major depressive-like symptoms were twice as likely to feel emotionally \ndistressed by the incident. Ybarra suggests that depression exacerbates both unwanted sexual \ncontact and the distress experienced as a result (see also Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004). \nIn what follows, we first consider who communicates using the internet. We then ask about \nthe social psychological, peer and family-related characteristics that may differentiate among \ndifferent kinds of user and, therefore, different categories of risk. We must note, however, that the \ndistinction between opportunities and risks is by no means straightforward, creating uncertainty \nover which activities are to be encouraged or restricted. As we have stressed, communication is by \nno means  problematic in itself, indeed generally it is a benefit. However, for a small minority of \ngrowing concern to policy makers, law enforcement and parents, it can be risky. Thus, while \n\u2018making friends online\u2019 is regarded by young people as an opportunity, it is regarded as risky by \nparents and law enforcement agencies, especially as the incidence of paedophile activity on the \ninternet increases (Palmer & Stacey, 2004; Wolak, Mitchell, & Finkelhor, 2003). Similarly, \u2018seeking \nadvice on the internet\u2019 is in many ways an opportunity for relationship or health advice, permitting \nthe candid exchange of sensitive information (Center For Media Education, 2002; Prasad & \nOwens, 2001; Suzuki & Calzo, 2004), but may also be seen as a risk if the advice concerns suicide \n(Becker, Mayer, Nagenborg, El-Faddagh, & Schmidt, 2004; Savin-Williams & Ream, 2003) or self-\nharm (Whitlock, Powers & Eckenrode, 2006). \n \n \nDesign and methods \n \nAs part of a broader, quantitative and qualitative research project on children and young people\u2019s \nuse of the internet in the UK, a national survey was conducted through an in-home, 40 minute, face \nto face, computer-assisted interview with children and young people aged 9-19, using Random \nLocation sampling across the UK.1 Following the design and piloting of the survey questionnaire \nby the research team, the fieldwork was carried out by a reputable market research company \n(British Market Research Bureau International). This was conducted via multi-media computer-\nassisted personal interviewing with children, together with a paper questionnaire completed by one \nparent of each of the 9-17 year olds, in Spring 2004. Informed consent was obtained from all \nrespondents and, for respondents under 18 years old, from a parent also (see www.children-go-\nonline.net for the research ethics policy). \nIn total, 1,511 interviews with 9-19 year olds were completed (see Table 1). The UKCGO \nsurvey asked a range of questions, distinguishing those questions which could be directed to all \nrespondents (including basic questions of internet access and use) and those which could only be \ndirected to internet users; here we focused on those who used the internet at least once per week \n(84% of the sample), asking more detailed questions of these respondents regarding specific \nonline skills, perceived self-efficacy online and questions about a range of online activities.2 In \naddition, 1077 parents of those aged 9-17 agreed to complete a questionnaire of which 920 paper \nquestionnaires were received and 906 were usable. In this article, percentages have been \nweighted to data from BMRB\u2019s Target Group Index and Youth surveys. The weighting efficiency \nwas 91% and the effective sample size was 1375. Raw sample sizes and all statistical analyses \nare based on unweighted data. \n \n \n 5\nTable 1 Survey participants (N=1511) by demographic characteristics \n \nDemographics \n \nSubgroup sample sizes \nAge 9-11 years \n(N=380) \n12-15 years \n(N=605) \n16-17 years \n(N=274) \n18-19 years \n(N=251) \nGender Boys \n(N=669) \nGirls \n(N=842) \n  \nSocioeconomic \nStatus (SES)3  \nAB \n(N=264) \nC1 \n(N=418) \nC2 \n(N=407) \nDE \n(N=422) \nRegion  England \n(N=1,228) \nWales  \n(N=69) \nScotland \n(N=166) \nNorthern Ireland \n(N=48) \nEthnicity  White \n(N=1,336) \nNon-white \n(N=171) \n  \n \nAs at this present, early stage of research on youth and the internet, no single theoretical \nframework proposes which factors may mediate risky or negative aspects of internet use, in \nformulating our research questions we have drawn on all the research reviewed above in order to \ndesign the survey questionnaire. Such factors include demographic factors, internet use measures,  \noffline social psychological factors (including measures of shyness, self-esteem, (dis)satisfaction \nwith one\u2019s life, and risk-taking or sensation-seeking), family communication dynamics, and \nperceptions of the nature of internet-based communication (confidence, secrecy, anonymity, \nintimacy, etc) (see Tables 4 and 5 for items). Thus, the following research questions were \nformulated:.  \n\u2022 RQ1: Do girls communicate more online than boys and, therefore, encounter more \ncommunicative risks (making friends, giving out personal information etc)? \n\u2022 RQ2: Are those who are socially anxious or lack self-esteem offline more likely to explore \ncommunicative opportunities online, thus engaging in more risky behaviours? \n\u2022 RQ3: Are those who lack an open communication channel with parents more likely to seek \nintimacy and guidance online? \n\u2022 RQ4: Do those who are more experienced, frequent and skilled internet users engage in a \ngreater range of risky internet-related communications? \n \n \n \nResults and discussion \n \nThe extent, nature and perception of online communication \n \nChildren and young people use the internet to communicate in different ways (see Table 2). Email \nis the most popular activity (72% of 9-19 year olds), followed by instant messaging (55%) and \nchatrooms (21%). However, socio-demographic factors make a difference. Middle class internet \nusers communicate at least once a month while those from working class homes do so less than \nonce a month. Email is more frequently used by older teens than by young children, and is a little \nmore used by girls and by middle class children. Similarly, instant messaging is more frequently \nused by older and middle class teens. However, chat rooms are more frequently used by older and \nworking class teens, though there are no significant differences by gender in the use of chat rooms \nor instant messaging. \n \nTable 2   Analyses of variance for frequency of online communication, by socio-demographic \nfactors \n \n Instant Messaging Email Chat \nOnline \ncommunication \noverall \n9-11 yrs 1.70 2.09 1.25 1.76 \n12-15 yrs 2.80 3.00 1.53 2.61 \n16-17 yrs 3.43       ** 3.62     ** 1.48      ** 2.93       ** \n18-19 yrs 2.89 3.92 1.53 2.84 \nMale 2.62 2.95 1.50 2.49 \nFemale 2.76 3.16       * 1.42 2.57 \nAB 2.95 3.39 1.31 2.59 \nC1 2.73 3.10 1.44 2.51 \nC2 2.72       ** 3.03       ** 1.61       ** 2.56 \nDE 2.33 2.66 1.50 2.41 \nTotal 2.69 3.05 1.46 2.53 \nBase: All 9 to 19 year olds who use the internet at least once a week (N=1262). \nNote: The frequency scale used is: 1 = never, 2 = less often, 3 = once a month, 4 = at least once a \nweek, 5 = every day. * Significant at p<0.05. ** Significant at p<0.01 \n \nThe differences between the social grades disappear for instant messaging if one just compares \nthose who have home access. However, for emailing and chatting the differences between the \nsocial groups persist even when home access is equalised. Children with equivalent access will \nthus use instant messaging in the same manner, but it seems that, for other reasons, middle class \nyoung users email more and chat less than working class young users. \nWhat do children and young people do when they communicate online? Many simply \ncontinue their offline friendships online, earning them the label, \u2018the constant contact generation\u2019 \n(Clark, 2005). Such routine chatting to friends that they also meet at school or in their \nneighbourhood is valued by young people as extending their communication possibilities \n(Livingstone & Bober, 2004a). Though sometimes deplored by parents as a distraction or waste of \ntime, it is not this communication that occasions great hopes or anxieties among observers. The \nsurvey examined several forms of online communication can be regarded as risky (especially, as \nfacilitating unwanted, harassing or paedophile contact), though each can also be regarded as \naffording positive opportunities. Thus questions asked about making new friends online, meeting \npeople offline that they first met online, seeking personal advice online, and giving out personal \ninformation online. This permits a further research question: \n \n\u2022 RQ5: Do similar factors explain whether and which children engage in different risky \nbehaviours, or does each require a different explanation (and, possibly, a different policy \nintervention)? \n \nThe popularity of these different activities varies. The findings show that 4 in 10 have given out \npersonal information;4 further, 1 in 3 have made friends online, 1 in 4 have sought personal advice \nonline and 9% have met someone offline that they first met offline (see Table 3). As before, these \nactivities vary for different socio-demographic groups. Giving out personal information is more \ncommon among teens, boys and those from middle class homes. This may be because, as shown \nelsewhere, those with better quality of access tend to use the internet more and so take up more \nopportunities as well as encountering more risks (Livingstone et al., 2005). The other activities do \nnot vary by gender or socioeconomic status, but they are each more common among teens than \nyounger children. \n \n 6\nTable 3   Analyses of variance for frequency of online communication, by socio-demographic \nfactors \n \n \nFriends online \n(a) \nMeet people \noffline (a) \nSeek advice \nonline (b) \nGive out \npersonal \ninformation \nonline \n(a) \n9-11 yrs 16% 2%  N\/A 19% \n12-15 yrs 33% 7% 21% 42% \n16-17 yrs 43%       ** 14%     ** 29%      ** 55%   ** \n18-19 yrs 32% 16% 32% 49% \nMale 33% 10% 26% 43% \nFemale 29% 7% 23% 36%      ** \nAB 31% 9% 26% 45% \nC1 34% 8% 26% 42% \nC2 32% 8% 24% 36%      ** \nDE 28% 8% 23% 34% \nTotal 31% 9% 25% 39% \nBase: a) All 9 to 19 year olds who use the internet at least once a week (N=1262). \nb) All 12 to 19 year olds who use the internet at least once a week (N=974). \n* Significant at p<0.05 \n** Significant at p<0.01 \n  \nThe 9%, who attend offline meetings with online friends is regarded with considerable \nconcern by law enforcement agencies. This figure is higher than the 3% found for a younger \nsample of primary school children (O'Connell, 2003) but lower than the 14% of 9-16 year olds \nreported in a five-nation European survey (Larsson, 2003) and the 16% of 12-17 year olds in \nSingapore (Liau, Khoo, & Ang, 2005). As Liau et al show, attending such meetings is predicted by \nage, frequency of internet use and parental rules. \nTo pursue the question of why children and young people communicate online for these \ndifferent purposes, the survey asked some more subjective questions regarding the perception of \nonline communication. Respondents\u2019 answers to five items, presented using a 5 point Likert-type \nscale, were entered into a factor analysis. This identified two distinct scales, one concerned with \nfeeling more confident with online than offline communication, one concerned with the advantages \nof an anonymous form of communication (see Table 4). \n \nTable 4   Factor analyses for perceptions of online communication \n \n Online confidence Value anonymity \nTalking on the internet is more satisfying than in real life 0.36 \n \n \nI feel more confident on the internet than I do in real life 0.60  \nIt's easier to keep things secret on the internet  0.32 \nIt's fun to be rude or silly on the internet  0.54 \nIt's easier to talk about personal things on the internet  0.35 \n \nVariance explained 27% 18% \nBase: All 12 to 19 year olds who use the internet at least once a week and use chat, email or \ninstant messaging (N=831).  \n \nNote: Factors extracted through Maximum Likelihood method based on Varimax Rotation with a \nselection criterion of eigenvalue >=1, R2=44%. \n \n 7\nMaking friends, disclosing personal information and seeking advice all require a certain \ndegree of trust in online communication, and this is, perhaps, enabled by a sense of anonymity or \nconfidence in the online environment (Joinson 2001; Spears et al., 2000; Walther 1996). It seems \n 8\nthat children and young people vary in the degree to which they consider the internet a \ncommunication environment that inspires their confidence or trust. But to ask which young people \nfeel this, and whether this leads them into riskier uses of the internet, requires some further steps \nin the analysis, as we undertake below. \n \nDifferentiating among users \n \nThus far, we have distinguished young people in terms of their socio-demographic \ncharacteristics. But, as the research literature stresses, a more subtle approach is needed. \nAlthough a survey can be a blunt instrument with which to measure the subtleties of children\u2019s \npsychology or family relationships, without a large sample size it is difficult to discern subtle \nassociations between social\/psychological contexts and internet use. Hence, the survey included \nitems concerned with the social psychology of the child and the family, presented in a private, self-\ncompletion section. These concerned social anxiety (specifically, social avoidance and fear of \nnegative evaluation; Chapman, 2002), risk-taking or sensation-seeking (Stephenson, Hoyle, \nPalmgreen, & Slater, 2003), life satisfaction (Huebner, 2001), and family communication patterns \n(using items from the children\u2019s version of the Revised Family Communication Pattern Instrument; \nKoerner & Fitzpatrick, 2002). A factor analysis produced factors for life satisfaction (including fear \nof negative evaluation items) and family communication patterns (distinguishing conversation-\noriented and conformity-oriented), leaving shyness and sensation-seeking as independent single \nitem scales (see Table 5). \n \nTable 5   Factor analysis results for the social psychological and family communication variables \n \n Shyness \nLife  \nsatisfaction\n \n \nSensatio\nn-seeking \nConversatio\nn-oriented \nfamily \nConformit\ny-oriented \nfamily \nI feel shy around people I \ndon't know 0.99  \n \n  \nI'm happy with my life at the \nmoment  -0.46 \n \n  \nI would like to change things \nin my life  0.72 \n \n  \nI worry what other people \nthink of me  0.40 \n \n  \nI often do dangerous things \nfor fun  0.21 \na) \n  \nMy parents generally ask \nwhat I think when the family \nis talking about something   \n \n0.51  \nIn my family, people like to \nlook at different sides of an \nissue   \n \n0.62  \nI can tell my parents almost \neverything   \n \n0.46  \nMy parents become irritated \nif my views are different from \ntheirs   \n \n 0.48 \nMy parents often say \"you'll \nknow better when you grow \nup\"   \n \n 0.53 \nVariance explained 21% 16%  12% 10% \nBase: All 9 to 19 year olds (N=1511) \nNote: Factors extracted through Maximum Likelihood method based on Varimax Rotation with a \nselection criterion of eigenvalue >=1, R2=58%.  \na) Since the highest factor loading of sensation-seeking was only 0.21, and previous research \nshowed this to be important, the sensation-seeking item was kept as a separate indicator.  \n \nThese social psychological and family communication characteristics are not distributed \nevenly through the population (see Table 6). In general, analyses of variance show that girls are \nshyer than boys; boys are more sensation-seeking, and they judge their families to be more \nconversation-oriented than do girls. Age is also important: as children grow into teens, they \nbecome more sensation-seeking, and their life satisfaction falls. Younger children and older teens \nboth perceive their families to be more conversation-oriented than do those in their middle teens, \nthough the younger children are also likely to consider their families fairly conformity-oriented, \nunlike the older teens. Social grade makes little difference, except that lower social grade children \njudge their family communication to be more conformity-oriented. Note that the correlation between \nconformity- and conversation-orientation measures is only -.05 (p=0.06), confirming that these are \nindependent rather than opposed measures (c.f. Fitzpatrick, Marshall, Leutwiler, & Krcmar, 1996); \nit is thus possible for  children to see their parents both as conversation- and conformity-oriented, \nthough others may see their parents are more conversation- than conformity-oriented, or vice \nversa.  \n \nTable 6   Analyses of variance for social psychological and family characteristics, by socio-\ndemographic variables \n \n Shyness \nSensation-\nseeking \nLife \nsatisfaction \nConversation- \noriented family \nConformity- \noriented family \n9-11 yrs 3.44 2.01 3.52 3.84 3.19 \n12-15 yrs 3.36 2.37 3.29 3.73 3.05 \n16-17 yrs 3.29 2.35     ** 3.18        ** 3.68        * 2.85       ** \n18-19 yrs 3.24 2.45 3.04 3.85 3.00 \nMale 3.22 2.63 3.32 3.69 3.02 \nFemale 3.48      ** 1.93     ** 3.24 3.84       ** 3.06 \nDE 3.33 2.36 3.28 3.76 3.26 \nC2 3.40 2.37 3.31 3.69 3.10 \nC1 3.36 2.22 3.29 3.75 3.03        ** \nAB 3.32 2.22 3.25 3.84 2.77 \nTotal 3.35 2.29 3.28 3.76 3.04 \nBase: All 9 to 19 year olds (N=1511) \n* Significant at p<0.05 \n** Significant at p<0.01 \n \n \nPredicting the take up of online communicative opportunities and risks \n \nAlthough qualitative research has argued that offline social relations frame the conduct of \nonline social relations (Baym, 2001; Slater, 2002), others have suggested that the online world is \nsomewhat divorced from, and so not predictable by, life offline (e.g., Turkle, 1995). Correlations \nbetween the online communication variables (confidence in online communication, valuing the \nanonymity of online communication) and offline social psychological and family variables (shyness, \nsensation-seeking, life satisfaction, conversation-oriented and conformity-oriented family) suggest \nthat these are linked. Thus, children and teens who feel more confident on the internet are more \nlikely to be shy (r=0.09, p<0.01), to be less satisfied with their lives (r=-0.10, p<0.01), and to come \nfrom conformity- (r=0.08, p<0.05) more than conversation-oriented (r=-0.13, p<0.01) families. \nFurther, those who value the anonymity of online communication are also more likely to be shy \n(r=0.11, p<0.01), to be more sensation-seeking (r=0.17, p<0.01) and to be less satisfied with their \nlives (r=-0.17, p<0.01). \nThis pattern of associations suggests that both offline and online variables may help to \nexplain the communicative risks and opportunities that children encounter on the internet. In the \nfinal step of these analyses, we conducted a series of multiple regressions - a linear regression to \nexplain the continuous variable of frequency of online communication, and four logistic regressions \n 9\n 10\nfor the binary variables of whether or not the respondent has a friend online, has met an online \nfriend offline, has sought advice online, or has given out personal information online. The model \nwas selected based on stepwise regression in which variables are entered one by one into the \nequation and variables are dropped from the model if they lose significance when a new variable is \nentered into the equation. The results are shown in Table 7.  \n \nTable 7   Linear and logistic regressions for measures of online communication \n \n  \nFreq. of online \ncommunication Friend online Offline meeting Advice Personal info \n  B Beta B Exp (B) B Exp (B) B Exp(B) B Exp(B) \n(Constant) \n-\n0.78   -4.05 0.02 \n-\n4.95 0.01 -2.90 0.06 -2.00 0.14 \nSocial grade                     \nAge 0.03 0.10     0.21 1.23 0.08 1.08 0.07 1.07 \nGender (Female)  0.20 0.11                 \nYears internet \nuse         \n-\n0.18 0.84         \nFrequency of use 0.32 0.31 0.46 1.58     -0.30 0.74 0.27 1.31 \nSelf-efficacy                 -0.22 0.80 \nSkills 0.11 0.24 0.18 1.20 0.18 1.20 0.27 1.32 0.13 1.14 \nShyness         \n-\n0.22 0.80         \nSensation-\nseeking 0.04 0.06     0.28 1.32     0.18 1.19 \nLife satisfaction     -0.19 0.83 \n-\n0.30 0.74 -0.17 0.85 -0.35 0.70 \nOnline confidence     0.74 2.10 0.60 1.82         \nValue anonymity 0.60 0.18 1.05 2.86 1.31 3.71 1.06 2.89 1.15 3.15 \n% correct  R2=0.31 69% 89% 74% 66% \nN= 877 840 858 750 750 \nBase: All 12 to 17 year olds who use the internet at least once a week and have used chatrooms, \nemails or instant messaging. \n \n \n \nThe regression analysis shows that those who communicate more frequently on the internet \ntend to be older teens, girls, frequent internet users, those who claim more online skills, who are \nsensation-seeking in their daily lives, and who value the anonymity afforded by online \ncommunication. Not all those who communicate online necessarily make new friends this way; as \nnoted earlier, much online communication is conducted with friends that the child has already \nestablished through their offline activities. However, for the one in three who do go on to make a \nfriend online that they have not met offline, this is not, it appears, a matter of demographic \nvariables, being typical neither of older teens or girls, even though these groups do communicate \nonline more in general. Rather, it seems that online friendships are characteristic of more frequent, \nskilled internet users who, in their daily lives, are less satisfied with their lives and who feel more \nconfident online, greatly valuing the anonymity the internet offers. \nGoing to meet an online friend offline is seen by many to involve yet further risk. This step is \ntaken, the results suggest, by older teens, boys and girls, who have not been using the internet for \nso long, though they claim more online skills. They are, interestingly, less shy offline and they are \nmore likely to be sensation-seekers who are dissatisfied with their lives. Like those who make \nfriends online, those who feel more confident communicating online than offline and value the \nanonymity of the internet are more likely to meet someone offline. In short, the relatively risky \nactivities of making and meeting online friends seems to depend on a particular balance of online \nand offline characteristics. In both cases, the likelihood of such activities is greater for the child who \n 11\nis less satisfied with their offline life, yet has become skilled online; this environment then affords \nthem the opportunity to feel more confident in their communication with others and, especially, to \nprovide the benefits of anonymity, including exchanging secrets, silliness and personal disclosure. \nWhat makes the difference between having an online friend and going to meet them offline, \nhowever, is being older (and so, presumably, more used to meeting people in public places), being \nless shy offline and, notably, being more sensation-seeking. For example, those who are high \nsensation seekers (score 5) are four times as likely as those who are not sensation seekers (score \n1) to have met someone offline. \nFollow up survey questions show that such meetings are partly risky because children may \ndo not tell friends or family that they are going to such a meeting: 45% told their parents and 78% \ntold their friends. Further, they rarely go with an adult (11% went with a parent), though 66% did \ntake a friend with them. It is important to note that, for most young people, these meetings are a \npositive experience: 58% said that they had a good time, 33% said it was nothing special and only \n1% said they did not enjoy it. Nor did we find, for the 160 in the survey who attended a meeting, \nany differences in the experience of the meeting comparing those with different social \npsychological and family communication characteristics.  \nTurning to two activities that could be regarded as either benefits and risks of online \ncommunication \u2013 seeking personal advice and giving out personal information \u2013 a somewhat \nsimilar pattern emerges (see Table 7). Both activities are more common among older teens, \nthough they are unrelated to gender and socioeconomic status. Both activities are also more \ncharacteristic of those who are dissatisfied with their offline lives but are skilled online and value \nthe anonymity offered by online communication. Further, seeking advice online is more typical of \nthose who use the internet less frequently, possibly because their use of the internet is \ninstrumental, motivated by a need established offline. Giving out personal information, as noted \nearlier, is required by most websites that facilitate more sophisticated, personalised or interactive \nuses of the internet, and so is understandably characteristic of more frequent users: indeed, \nfrequently users are constantly invited to give out personal information such as one\u2019s name, email \naddress and personal preferences; unsurprisingly then, they seem more likely to accede to these \nrequests. It is a perhaps puzzling that those young people who give out personal information also \nhave lower self-efficacy online, but it may be that, since they are engaged in more complex online \ninteractions (being skilled and frequent users), they have come to judge their own skills more \nmodestly. Notably, they are also more likely to be sensation-seeking: whether or not they are \naware of the frequent warnings against providing personal information online, it seems they go \nahead. \n \n \n \nConclusions \n \nResearch question 1 asked whether girls communicate more online than boys and, therefore, \nencounter more communicative risks (making friends, giving out personal information etc)? The \nfindings show that it is age more than gender that is crucial (see also Liau, et al, 2005). Older teens \nengage in a greater range of online communication activities than do younger children, and thus \nthey may encounter a greater range of communication risks; the exception is that they are no more \nlikely to make a friend online than are younger children. Social grade does not differentiate among \nchildren, and gender makes a difference only to the overall frequency of online communication: \ngirls communicate more on the internet, but this seems not to put them more at risk in relation to \nthe other activities examined, raising questions for future research regarding possible gender \ndifferences in responses to risky encounters. \nResearch question 2 asked whether those who are socially anxious or lack self-esteem \noffline are more likely to explore communicative opportunities online, thus engaging in more risky \nbehaviours. The findings showed that the offline social psychological characteristics of children \nlives do influence their online communication. Being shy offline makes little difference online, \nexcept it decreases the likelihood of offline meetings with people met online \u2013 apparently a \ncontinuity between off and online. However, being dissatisfied with one\u2019s life is important: although \nnot associated with more frequent online communication (this being more a matter of \ndemographics and quality of internet access; Livingstone & Bober, 2004a), lower life satisfaction \n 12\nappears to increase the likelihood of risky communication, suggesting the online compensates in \nsome way for the offline. Such dissatisfaction offline is, therefore, associated with making friends \nonline, going to offline meetings with online friends, seeking personal advice online and giving out \npersonal information online. Further, being sensation-seeking matters: those who are more \nsensation-seeking in their lives generally are also more likely to be sensation-seeking online \u2013 \nanother continuity between off and online: these teens communicate online more frequently, go to \noffline meetings with friends made online, and disclose personal information online. \nIn answer to research question 3, which asked whether those who lack an open \ncommunication channel with parents are more likely to seek intimacy and guidance online, we \nobserve that the family communication variables did not contribute significantly to these multiple \nregression analyses. This may be because they were correlated with the social psychological \nvariables. Specifically, shyness is negatively correlated with life satisfaction (r=-0.22, p<0.01) and \npositively correlated with a conformity-oriented family (r=0.11, p<0.01). Life satisfaction, in turn, is \npositively correlated with conversation orientation (r=0.17, p<0.01) and negatively correlated with \nconformity orientation (r=-0.16, p<0.01). Lastly, sensation-seeking is negatively correlated with life \nsatisfaction (r=-0.17, p<0.01) and conversation orientation (r=-0.07, p<0.01) and positively \ncorrelated with conformity orientation (r=0.15, p<0.01). It seems, then, that shyer children are less \nhappy with their lives and are more likely to come from a conformity-oriented family. Although \nshyness and sensation-seeking are unrelated, children who are more sensation-seeking also come \nfrom conformity- more than conversation-oriented families and are, also, less happy with their lives. \nPutting this the other way around, those who see their families as more conformity-oriented are \nmore likely to be shy, dissatisfied and\/or sensation-seeking, while conversation-oriented families \nare more likely to have satisfied children who, although they may or may not be shy, are less \nsensation-seeking. \nWe can also identify some modest associations between family communication and \nchildren\u2019s online communication activities. Children and teens who judge their family more \nconversation-oriented use the internet less often in general (r=-0.07, p<0.05), telephone people \nmore often (r=0.06, p<0.05), and are less likely to meet an online friend offline (r=-0.06, p<0.05). \nThose who judge their family more conformity-oriented are more likely to use chat rooms on the \ninternet (r=0.23, p<0.05). Further, the family communication scales are correlated with online \nconfidence (positively, for conformity orientation, r=0.08, p<0.05; negatively, for conversation \norientation, r=-0.13, p<0.01), though they are not correlated with valuing anonymity online. It \nseems that those children and teens who have difficulty discussing personal issues with their \nparents, or who feel their parents to be conformity oriented rather than conversation oriented, may \ntake some greater risks online \u2013 visiting chat rooms and meeting online friends offline \u2013 and this \nmay be because they feel more confident communicating online than they do offline. \nWhy do offline characteristics affect online communication? Although the multiple regression \nanalyses do not, strictly speaking, permit causal inferences among the variables, our interpretation \nis as follows. Among those children and teens who are, for whatever reason, less satisfied with \ntheir lives and, perhaps, more sensation-seeking, some have become frequent and skilled internet \nusers. Research Question 4 asked whether those who are more experienced, frequent and skilled \ninternet users engage in a greater range of risky internet-related communications. Frequency of \nuse and internet skills do matter, predicting each type of online communication examined. It seems \nthat among these dissatisfied but skilled youngsters, some have particularly come to value the \ninternet as a communicative environment in which they find conversation more satisfying, and feel \nmore confident, than they do offline. As a result - and this is evident from all five regression \nanalyses - it seems that they come to value the specific characteristics of online communication, \nsuch as anonymity, the chance to exchange secrets or be silly or to disclose personal or intimate \naspects of their lives.5 Pew\u2019s survey of US teens found that 24% have pretended to be someone \nelse in a chat room (Pew, 2001), while the present survey found 40% to have pretended about \nsome aspect of themselves. On the other hand, as Spears et al (2000) observe, many regard the \ninternet less as an opportunity to pretend as to reveal their \u2018true self\u2019 and this may also result in \nrisky encounters. Note that in the regression equations, the odds ratios for valuing anonymity are \nhigh (except when predicting the general frequency of online communication); an increase in this \nvariable causes by far the largest increase in the likelihood of all these activities.  \nResearch question 5 asked whether similar factors explain whether and which children \nengage in different risky behaviours, or whether each requires a different explanation (and, \n 13\ntherefore, policy intervention). We have summarised the similarities and differences in explanations \nfor the likelihood of the different forms of online communication above. Of particular policy \nrelevance, we suggest, is the importance of low life satisfaction in predicting who will make online \nfriends, go to meetings, seek online advice and give out personal information. Similarly, the \ntendency of sensation-seeking youngsters to give out personal information and go to offline \nmeetings is noteworthy, and so too is the relative inexperience with the internet of those who go to \nsuch meetings. The temptation to see girls and younger children as particularly at risk seems \nmisplaced, since it is the greater confidence that some older children feel in relation to online \ncompared with offline relations that is more important here. \nThe mediating role of internet skills is thought-provoking: rather than being those lacking \nonline skills, it is precisely the more skilled (though not necessarily more self-efficacious) who \nencounter more risks \u2013 and more opportunities \u2013 on the internet (see also Livingstone et al., 2005). \nHaving open communication channels with parents also makes a difference, and could be a \nvaluable focus for practical parental guidance. Last, we note that those formulating policy to raise \nsafety awareness might usefully, therefore, focus on the way in which children at risk appear to \nvalue the internet as a particularly enabling environment for intimate or private communication. As \nnoted at the outset, balancing the benefits against the risks of online communication is a difficult \ntask and one must be responsive to the different social and psychological conditions that mediate \nthese outcomes for children living in different circumstances. The present results would suggest \nthat for those particularly likely to take risks online, targeting safety guidance to parents might be \nless effective than targeting it at young people themselves, including through schools or websites. \nHowever, simply blaming (or praising) the internet is not an appropriate strategy: the overall \nimplication of the present findings is that, following up on Jackson et al (2001) (see also \nSubrahmanyam et al., 2000), it is not so much that internet use makes some young people \ndissatisfied, unconfident or risk-takers, but rather it seems that those who are already dissatisfied, \nor sensation-seeking, or with poor relations with parents, are more likely \u2013 especially if they are \nalso skilled and confident on the internet \u2013 to encounter online communication risks. \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis article reports on research funded by an Economic and Social Research Council grant (RES-\n335-25-0008) as part of the \u2018e-Society\u2019 Programme, with co-funding from AOL, BSC, Childnet-\nInternational, Citizens Online, ITC and Ofcom (see www.children-go-online.net).

Strict rules are given which govern the distribution, spacing \nand timing of interviews. \n2 For a detailed explanation of the scales, see Livingstone, Bober and Helsper (2005). \nSkills scale. This summed the internet-related skills that respondents claimed to be \u2018good at\u2019 (scale \n0-6): finding the information you need on the web, setting up an email account, sending an instant \nmessage, setting up a filter for junk mail or pop-up adverts, getting rid of a virus on your computer \nand fixing a problem by yourself when something goes wrong. The reliability coefficient for this \nscale was acceptable (alpha = 0.70). \nSelf-efficacy: 4 point scale (beginner-average-advanced-expert), from Eastin & LaRose (2000). \nFrequency of use: 8 point scale, from 8 (uses more than once day) through 5 (uses once a month) \nto 1 (never uses). \nAverage time per day online: Respondents estimated time spent online on a typical weekday and \nweekend day. A composite score was calculated for average time spent online per day: 1=none, \n2=about 10 minutes, 3=about half an hour, 4=about an hour, 5=1-2 hours, 6=2-3 hours, 7=3+ \nhours. \n3 Socio-economic status is measured according to the standard UK market research categories: A \n\u2013 Upper middle class (Higher managerial administrative or professional occupations, top level civil \nservants), B \u2013 Middle class (Intermediate managerial administrative or professional people, senior \nofficers in local government and civil service), C1 \u2013 Lower middle class (Supervisory or clerical and \njunior managerial administrative or professional occupations), C2 \u2013 Skilled working class (Skilled \nmanual workers), D \u2013 Working class (Semi and unskilled manual workers), E \u2013 Those at lowest \nlevels of subsistence (all those entirely dependent on the State: long term, casual workers, those \nwithout regular income). Socio-economic status is strongly correlated with measures of parental \noccupation, education and income. \n4 Specifically, these 9-19 year olds say that they have revealed their hobbies (27%), email address \n(24%), full name (17%), age (17%), name of their school (9%) phone number (7%) or sent a \nphotograph (7%) to someone that they met on the internet. \n5 Across the whole sample, 40% say that they have pretended about themselves online \u2013 using, for \nexample, a different name (27%), changing their age (22%), appearance (10%) or gender (5%). \nAnd though they often know the safety rules, a minority (7%) admits to forgetting about safety \nguidelines online while 17% enjoy being rude or silly on the internet (Livingstone & Bober, 2005). \n"}
